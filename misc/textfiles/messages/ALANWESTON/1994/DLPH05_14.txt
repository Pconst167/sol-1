I see that Boisy or James haven't replied... <grin>  Those guys must
be busy...  I used to work at M'ware and indeed there is an assembler
available as part of the compiler package, although I can't imagine
why you would want to use it.  OS-9000 was designed for and written in
C and with Ultra-C available for OS-9000/386 there really isn't much
need to use assembler code anymore.  I've done quite a bit of driver
work in OS-9000 using Ultra-C and you have to work a long time doing
hand optimization to write more efficient assembler code than what the
compiler generates.  Not really worth it if you ask me...  If you want
more info I will be happy to reply.  E-mail works better for me as I
read that daily and hit the forums only sporadically.

Take care, and above all, keep havin' fun!

 >All this assumes that time is linear and spacetime is all there is.

 Nonsense.  I already stated that a collapsar could be approached in a
 spacelike way and left in timelike way.  Also a moving wormhole mouth would
 create a corridor with a separation in both space _and_ time.

 Spacetime is not "all there is" because it doesn't exist without matter-
 energy to define it.

 Let do a simple experiment:  Go into your living room with a hammer.  Hold
 tht
 ammer out at arm's length and predict whether it will fall to the
 floor or not fall to the floor when you release it.  If you guessed it will
 fall, get a gold star from the box but don't give it to your self yet.

 The perfectly Vulcan <g> conclusion that the hammer will fall is based on
 observation of reality and you, probably, have several thousand confirming
 incidents.  Now why is it that you (and many others) resist special
 relativity when there are _trillions_ of confirming incidents from particle
 accelerator experiments alone?  If you required even that much evidence for the

 falling hammer trick then you should feel perfectly safe holding above your
 head and releasing it.

 If you balk at holding the hammer over your head and letting it fall you can
 now give yourself the gold star.  If you can understand _why_ you don't want
 to do it give yourself another.

 Only if you accept the Copenhagen interpretation which assigns an
 indispensible role to the observer or measuring instruments in determining
 an outcome.  I never bought it and used to get my professors p***ed at me
 for claiming that it introduced a fundamental contradiction into quantum
 mechanics.  A few years after I left school I found that a fellow named Bohm
 had formulated an alternate interpretation that didn't rely on any
 subjectivism.

 Unfortunately for Physics, Bohm refused to yield to the politcal correctness
 of his day and was cited by the House UnAmerican Activities Commitee for
 contempt and was eventually forced off the faculty at Princeton.  He made a
 lot of contributions to both quantum and "normal" physics but his alternate
 explanation got buried along the way.  Fortunately for Physics, good science
 doesn't stay buried and there is new interest in Bohm's interpertation of
 quantum mechanics.

One of the neater things that comes with OS9's multi-user setup
is that it doesn't really care much where it is controlled from.

By offering the option of a basic terminal system, Ed Gresick (Delmar)
allows his customer to buy only what they need to get started -
if you are reading this on a computer, you have the rest (GRIN).

I think about 80% of what I do on my OSK machine can be done just
as well from a terminal as from the keyboard.  I can't view
graphics, like gif pictures, but MOST of the better programs I
have acquired have the option of a basic terminal display.

I have at this time a System 5 on order, so I'll try to fill you in on exactly
what is involved with the Delmar products.

Delmar sells assembled systems.  You can order these pieces from Practical
Peripherals in a fashion similar to the FHL way.  Delmar sells two
configurations:

  1) Serial System : Motherboard, memory(however much you want), RS-232
     ports, Sound Port, 1(or 2) floppy drives, Case, Professional OS9,
     Microware C Compiler.
  2) Console System: The Serial System + Keyboard and VGA card, ready to
     hook up an SVGA monitor.

The Serial System can be hooked up to a Terminal or your CoCo using Terminal
software, and is in fact, ready to run.  In addition, you can add about any
hardware you want.  I ordered a complete Console System with G-Windows and
a hard drive installed.  I could have gotten the hard drive for a little less
mail order, but it will be already installed, include cabling and they will
install some software for me, so I opted to get the HD from him.

They also sell monitors but do not push them.  I ordered mine from a mail
order house.

I think any of the systems would be quite nice.  The main reason I went with
Delmar was that I thought that there might be a chance that it would be
easier to get replacement cards in the future.  I would think that as of this
time, there might be a little more MM/1-specific software available, but
as I understand it, any text-based software should run on any system.

Sorry to disagree, but computers have killed people (several that I am
aware of).  This ws due to errors in the programs, one of the most well
know is for a radiation treatment machine (computer controlled dosage)
that killed severalpeople by giving them too much radiation (it also
burned many others).  Other examples are manufacturing robots, still
others could be faulty avionics in aircraft.

There a lot of risks in the wolrd and computer control of machines

The seizures are not so much an aspect of the computer game as they are
of the bright fast moving lights (images).  Strobe lights have been know
to trigger epileptic seizures in epileptic people.  I would suspect that
the video images are performing a similar function.

 the above-mentioned stuff, of course (fast RAM, larger hard disk)

 I think somebody posted a request for help with a LineLink 144e. Here's what
 I found out:

 Don't bother calling the the Mac Warehouse help line; they're pretty
 useless.  I was able to find out that the modem is manufactured by
 Prometheus so I called their tech support line and got the pin outs for the
 db 25 connector:

     2 - TX (transmit data)
     3 - RX (recieve data)
     4 - RTS (request to send)
     5 - CTS (clear to send)
     6 - DSR (whatever that is)
     7 - Ground
     8 - DCD (carrier detect)
    20 - DTR (data terminal ready)
    22 - Ring

 If your port doesn't have CTS at pin 5, you have to use "at&r1" to tell the
 modem to use the DTR on pin 20 as CTS.  If you have both CTS and DTR then
 use "at&r0".  I also tried connecting pin 20 from the port to pin 5 on the
 modem and that seemed to work too.

My manual says that &R0 is the PC MODE and the &R1 is the MAC MODE.
&R0 has DTR and RTS signals functioning normally for a PC.
The manual says that &R1 configures for BI-directional RTS/CTS flow with
&K3 or \Q3 set.

     From: MDALENE      To: ILLUSIONIST

    That Heathkit Box if it is the H77 Dual 5 1/4 case will gladly power
one Full hight Hard drive and possibly one 3 1/2" floppy. I know as I have
one and I use it to run my full hight Miniscribe 10 Meg monster. Ps gets
warm but not too hot you sizzle your fingers. The H77 box has the holes
already to hold FOUR(4) half hight drives and with a little soldering you
can easily add two more floppy connectors (WARNING!!! Get your polarity
Right!) It also has 120/220 Selectable Linear PS with Awsome filtration!
If you look at the PCB of the PS you will notice that some extra xformer
wires are there that are unused. I belive then are 30VAC that can be
rectified and filtered to run a eight inch Floppy drive! It appears to be
the same PS that was in my H47 8" drive subsystem for my old H88 CP/M
computer with on the 5vdc and 12vdc outputs being used.
    The wires are on the upper left of the PCB and I believe are RED
If you add a full wave rectifier, a 2200 uF cap and a voltage regulator
you can get more 12VDC and 5VDC for more light loads.
Also for the 220VAC 50/60Hz and the 120VAC 50/60HZ the voltage select
controls are on the little silver box in the back of the Power switch
and the fuse holder. Easily seen and manipulated with a small screwdriver
    For one merit. the Line fuses pop before the PS is overtaxed too
badly. you cannot easily blow that PS! I have accidently shorted wires and@
popped the fuse everytime!

Yep its an H77, I just got full docs for the thing and took 1 look at
the specs and realized that it will power a full height HD with little
effort.. I am just gonna throw 2 modern 3.5 SCSI HD's in there, as soon
as I get my SCSI controllers and such for OS-9.. it'll be nice having
80meg of MFM HD space, plus whatever amount I get on the SCSI.. I will
soon phase out the MFM's though.. as far as I see it, SCSI is the way to
go for the CoCo (wish we had IDE too but, oh well) SCSI is fine with me..
nice big drives for a fairly low price (just like the CoCo itself..
excellent, powerfull OS, for little money)..

thanks for the info..

No prohlem. I too am going to go SCSI as soon as I can get the money
,as my C.B friends say, greenstamps.
        what is the power handling capacity of the P.S? where did you
find it? I may want to see if I can get another.

:) I got mine from the local community college, when they junk a bunch
of computer stuff (or anything for that matter) they put it all on big
tables for a day or 2 outside the buildings, students are allowed to pick
through and take what they want..I grabbed the heathkit, and a vt52 terminal
I dont have the manual handy, its at home (I am at the college now) but
I will email you the power handling cap. as soon as I get a chance..

    your problem is really easily solved! Just go out and buy the 74F00
chips and replace the 74ls00 series with those :) My CocoXt-RTC was
dead to the world and Chris Burke told me to replace those chips and it
works good. I actually had him do it as I wanted to have him fix my
clock that was running toooooo fast. I could have replaced those chips
myself if I was not scared of busting the small pcb :)

I realize you can lock out areas of a file, but it is much easier if you lock
the
whole file forIt's easier to avoid deadlock if you try to
lock the file, can't and report an exception.  Not the cleanest or most
efficient granted, but very easy to do.

     Colani Mouse
     From: JEJONES      To: ALL

Well...maybe I'm becoming a yuppie, but I've bought a designer mouse.
(Honest, the signature's right there on the side.  I'd asked friends to put
me out of my misery if they ever saw me watching *thirtysomething*, but I
hadn't expected this.)  I decided I didn't like the trackball I was using;
it's not easy to accurately spin that little ball with the thumb.  (Well,
it's not easy for me, anyway.)

So, I finally bought a Colani Mouse.  I'd seen it advertised in a Tiger
Software catalog, but I'd lost the catalog--and then I saw it in the May
*Computer Shopper*.  It's a nice mouse; ergonometrically shaped with a
vengeance (so I have a right-handed version)--somebody finally noticed
that muscle you flex to touch your thumb to your little finger, probably
called the pollicis whatchamacallit, and shaped the mouse to fit.  It has
little Teflon pads on the bottom so it slides very smoothly--I have no
trouble drawing lines in paint that are vertical or horizontal to within
a pixel, and I didn't have a prayer of doing that with the trackball.
It claims compatibility with Microsoft or Mouse Systems, but I had to
boot up with a driver for Mouse Systems mice to get it to go.

I'm very pleased with it.  (I'm not associated with the manufacturer.)

Mac,

You can purchase an excellent RS-232 interface from CoNect in Milwaukee.
Contact Rick Ulland here through REVCWP and ask him if he can sell you
one.  I use one and I highly recommend it.

     Ribbs
     From: DENNYWRIGHT  To: ALL

Does anyone know of a program for ribbs called filesrch. It supposedly checks
for new files? A end has RiBBS running on his computer and came across it
in a download menu. It's called by ribbs as an outside program. He got a five d
disk set from Warren Hrach but it doesn't seem to have that particular utility.
I've looked in the database here but didn't see it or anything like it. Any
idea where he can get hold of it?

All you have to do is load a device descriptor for the appropriate partition
of your hard drive. Then just use the copy command.

Hi Zack--please forgive my ignorance, but what device descriptor shoul I
load? I have a file in the dog partition like--c:\OS9.bin and I want to
get it over into the OS9000 area. I'm just getting to use OS9000 so I'm
a little green in some of the stuff. Thanks! <Phil>
