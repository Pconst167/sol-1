    Sounds great Chris. We need good drivers for logging into CD-i & CDROM
disks. I'll be making a CD game for the MM/1 soon (just got a main routine
going!) and that will be essential.

    By the way, I just got off the phone today with OptImage after a big
phone runaround with Philips and Tech Service. I wanted to get a dev system
(CDI 602 or 605), they come with an I/O card and ethernet interface, as well
as floppy and caddy CD-i drive. With a DV card it all costs about $42,000.00
which puts it far out of my reach. This makes the talked about "magic" disk
the only real way for me to develop on CD-i. I still want a writeable CD
drive as I want to author CD-i CD-A and CD+G disks. They are sending me more
info. I might be able to get an extremely stripped CDI 602. ???


    Hoping, waiting, and wrighting,

      Dave

    Hi all,

  In case your wondering why I haven't made the least bit of noise around
here, my account was suspended last month and as you know it takes weeks
for Delphi to process things. So here I am. I know you are all jumping for
joy. :)

Surprised me.   Questions as follows: #1 Yes.  #2 DM disk boots itself.
#3 Yes I xarc it and printed the ded.doc.   I dl'd the program:
   DED: DISK EDITOR.....there are 3 programs in APP.  I used my orig-
inal system disk to boot after I put ded on a blank disk as I was
having problems with ATTR.   I called it RAY and renamed to ded.
I replaced the SYS disk with the DM disk and used the chx /d0/cmds,,,
and the chd /d0 to get the computer in the right mood.

I ended up with:    /d0/ded os9boot    and I got all the cols and rows.
I got into the p module and changed to 04 as u said. after doing it
like U said it was verified etc.  I then started over and booted the
DM disk--but a sample letter whouldn't print 1t 2400 B.  still 600.

The only place u can change baud is to 600 0r 1200. I tried both.
my p won't take 1200.  The tel progam can be changed to 2400 but I
don't use it. I have Dterm and Supercomm for tel comm.
so ooooooo.    ??????

On some of my Supercomm disks I can't seem to set the attr so I can read.
I hadn't used it in some time--wonder what happened?  I tried to change
the attr by using the big book method but all I get is ewrewr--no pepwpr.
I wanted to list the CMDS directory to check what is in it--but no dice.

Well T've written enuf stuff-hope U can make it out--R

yes, GESPAC has a nice offering.  I notice lately that they have come out
with a lot of Intel/ Windows stuff.  It must hurt them to have to
do that, but customers are a demanding lot!  With the low price of
PC's, a plant engineer can set up a nice operator workstation with
good graphics and never have to write a line of code-- never see
a "C" compiler.  Maybe the Power PC will open up a new opportunity.
Do you think K-windows will be a "hit" on the power PC?

Your message regarding "pointers" in C:  As a casual programmer,
I have often wondered exactly why pointers in C were a particular
advantage.  With various Basics, one can pass by value or by
reference.  I have often wondered if this pointer stuff is a
kludge to make up for lack of a more intuitive mechanism.

Pointers have other purposes than simulating call by reference; their
main use is to build up data structures.  Admittedly, the pointer is
to data structures what goto is to control structures, and for a while
people proposed providing recursive data structure definitions to make
pointers unnecessary at the source language level.

Opinions herein are solely those of their respective authors.

 It is true that pointers to atomic data types or to structures can be very
 confusing.  Also the C pointer arithmetic can cause some headaches at times
 too.  I'm used to them so I don't really think about them anymore.  I
 suppose some other mechanism is possible but it would probably use pointers
 anyway; just make them transparent to the programmer.

 The case I was making to Frank regards pointer to functions rather than to
 data.  They make handling certain types of event driven programming very
 simple (or as simple as event driven programmng can be :-) and AFAIK no
 Basic supports them.  Also, Gwindows uses a pointer to the named function
 when it sets up a callback function for a window event.  I don't want to end
 up posting 30K of tutorial here but I'm writing an occassional guest spot
 for Ed Gresick's "Gee Windows" column in 68 Micro and I plan to cover this
 subject in a future article.

I don't know what the prob was but I ended up reformating the drive,I then
Put Hyper I/O on it so I can use         RSDOS on my hard drive.I had all my Os9

stuff backed up to My second hard drive so I thought I was safe.I put all
the backed up stuff and put it back on /h0 and deleted it from /h1.I was
getting tired so I went to bed,then the next day I found out that I did
Hyper I/O wrong so it messed every thing up and I had already deleted
all the backed up stuff from /h1 so I had to start all over again!!!!
I am still setting everything back up.I have set this thing up afew
times now so I will get good at it sooner or later.Each time I have
to redo thins darn thing I learn a little,I also have learned a
little about covering my butt,so I have a directory on /h1 called
HARD0 with most of the important and hard to find stuff so if I
have to reformat my /h0 I have a good start at setting it back up
on /h1.Once I get this thing set up the way I want it I will back
it up on floppies,but that will be a while!!!!!Thanks for the info!!
