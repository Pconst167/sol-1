Dear Sysop:

Where can I get some introductory documentation on OS-9. For my general
understanding. I am a EE with quite a bit of exposure to software and so am
looking for more than 'What is an OS' type of documentation.

Thanks.

Krish,

Welcome to the forum!

We have a couple of files in our libraries that might shed some light on your
quest for knowledge. Take a look at INTRO.TXT in LIB 2 as well as OS9FAQ.TXT in
LIB 1 for starters.

Let us know how we can help

Sb: #Two drivers?
Fm: Ian Hodgson 72177,1762
To: All

Is it possible to have two disk drivers (eg. cc3disk and Sdisk3) in a boot file
and refer to the appropriate one with suitable device descriptors? I mention
this because I do a fair amount of transferring to and from MSDOS diskettes
using PCDOS, and this requires Sdisk3. However, Sdisk3 does not support the
no-halt operation of my Disto Super Controller II. The result is that I have to
do a lot of rebooting, saving to floppy (no hard drive), etc.

If I could have both drivers in memory it would make things much easier; all I
would need is another descriptor, say d3 (or B:, heh heh), to access IBM
diskettes. I suppose I'm being lazy and could simply try it, but I don't want
to go to the trouble of making a new boot file if someone already knows that it
won't work. But, to tell the truth, I don't see why it shouldn't.

The only problem you may encounter is that if both drivers perform some
initialization that causes the other to be displaced... Say WD1793
manipulation, interrupt hooking, etc.

Best bet is probably just trying it (on non-essential disks!)...

Guess you're right. I'll be safe and make up a new system diskette for the
trials. If it works I'll let you know.

Since drivers, desc., the kernal, etc. all have to reside in one MMU block, you
may find that your system map getting full. One sign of this is the inability
to format a disk...the track buffer for format also comes from the same 64K
block.

Sb: CoCo3 and more for sale
Fm: Gregory Walker 73577,677
To: ALL

I have decided to sell my CoCo 3, B&B Hard drive, Disto Supercontroller, etc.
I have posted the file 4SALE2.TXT in Forum 14 (Classifieds) that lists the
items and my initial asking prices.

I hope we can do business.
