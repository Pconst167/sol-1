Is there an American distributor for your utility that read/writes OS/9 on an
MS-DOS machine? I like you demo, and wish to purchase it, but I would like to
see all of my options. If I purchase direct from you, what is the approximate
dollar equivalent for your DM price?

Doug,

There is a 6809 emulator that runs on a PC that should help your development.
You could run that and use your old CoCo software.  Versions for Level I and II
OS-9 are out there I believe and freely available on the Internet.

Some others here might have more information to offer about this.  I'm "out of
the OS-9 loop" now and have never run these emulators.

Good Luck,
Mark

The file OS9MAX (ARJ) in this forum has an effulgent description of its
wondrous capabilities when in fact it is a DEMO.  I discovered it via the
filefinder program on the CompuServe CD-ROM for September, and went straight
for it, as I have a number of old os9 SS DD disks that I would like to be able
to port over to the PC.

But, not only is this program a Demo, it excludes this very format, though I
can (huh!) send a sample disk to Germany for "evaluation" . . . . ?

Please advise others that this is not a fully working program, but a subtle ad
for a commercial program - even though the Demo may work well if you have the
formats it covers.  I spent about 20 minutes downloading this at 2400 baud and
will be asking CIS for a credit.

Nothing personal intended,

Sincerely, Alan Bain.

    Those few of you that have continued to use this system over the last few
months already know what's coming.......

    December 31, 1994 is the CoCo Corner's LAST DAY on-line !!!!

     I've not wanted to do this, but the lack of use has forced it. I can't
justify leaving it running anymore.....

     To those of you that have been faithful users, I say 'Thank You' for your
support of my little adventure in telecommunications.

I hope the information you have gotten from this system's file and message
bases have help you enjoy you 'CoCo' as much as I have over the years.  I was
glad to have been here for the last 7 years helping all that needed it.

   Have a very Merry Christmas and the Best of a New Year !!!
