I have two 6-foot cables (that's the shortest I have seen).  The
one that works came from a local discount store ("Office MAX") and
cost about $6.95.  (The one that won't work cost about $10 - go
figure).

This printer cable business drove me NUTS for a while -- at one time
I had the DeskJet and the EPSON connected via two serial switching
boxes to both computers, so I could switch either computer to either
printer (Cables all over the desk) and everything seemed to work.

Then I started having trouble with the Ghostscript --> Epson output.
I hunted for bugs in the driver for some time, and then fed the
output file from Ghostscript to the EPSON from the "386" - and
it worked.  Thats when I started swapping cables and found only
one that would let me feed the file from the MM/1 directly to the
EPSON.  ((all this time, text files were ok -- just the binary
printer files were screwed up)).  I thought maybe I was getting a
weak signal from the MM/1 -- maybe just not quite enough for the
EPSON -- so I borrowed one of those "printer selector" boxes for
a test -- I figured it's buffer would help -- nope.  The short
(cheap) cable is the only thing that works.  It must be something
involving timing -- something is just barely within the limit, and
any stray inductance/capacitance in the cable pushes it past the
edge of the "gate".

Funny, the mouse that works best with my MM/1 came in a plain
white box -- just said "MOUSE" - cost $9.95.  This computer wants
plain peripherials - no fancy stuff please.

Strangly enough, I have two types of parallel printer cables here.  Seems the
older type are wired differently on a few lines.  They don't work on PCs
either.  I have a 6 footer that works on my MM/1 but I haven't had the time
(or the guts <g>) to send anything to the printer using ghostscript...yet.
Will let you know how it works out.  IF anything fails, it will fail on my
system (grin).

Right, of course.  My "zerop" script is overkill -- tab and linefeed
were the troublemakers.  I just keep zeroing everything out of habit.

If your manual is like the one that came with my printer, all the

manual has lots of programming examples.  My reference manual is
a 1991 edition, and the AP3250 is not there -- newer.

I've not fooled with it for quite a while, but as I recall, a ? on the
second line of the xxx.AIF file will cause gshell to open a window and
ask you for "parameters", eg the arguments you would normally enter on
the command line. Hope this is right, and helps.

GShell+.

In case you may not know, GShell+ is the standard MultiVue graphics shell,
gshell, which has been patched with the "GShell Plus" patch (patch available
here in the Delphi libs).

Once you are running GShell+, just put a ? in line 2 of the AIF. Then, when
you click on the icon, before the app is launched, GShell+ opens up a little
overlay window which prompts "Parameters?". Whatever you enter will be
supplied to the app as standard "command line options".

     OS-9 Late Night:recap
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

        Last night we had the 'Atlanta Fest Fallout!', and what a good
   LOOONG conference it was. As a matter of fact, for the first time, I
   was not the last person there. I don't know how late it went.
   Unfortunately, I suffered a couple crashes/freezups through the course
   of the night which really screwed me up a lot. We won't have the
   transcript, because somehow my capture buffer was lost in the
   commotion(I went to edit it just a minute ago, and I entered Ved to
   find, yes the file was there, but empty :-( ). It's too bad because a
   lot of interesting stuff was discussed.
        Thanks to Ken Scales and Colin McKay who took time out(AGAIN!) to
   show up online and answer fest related questions, since they had
   attended. We who didn't go, found that vendors did reasonably well,
   while attendance was down again just a bit. Perhaps we can help(maybe
   through the UG)  to better promote the next one. I didn't get to do
   the conference on it till about a week beforehand, since I didn't have
   much time, considering I started not too long ago doing this. Also I
   think the fact that both the MOTD and OS-9 Underground suffered
   serious delays in getting issues out, contributed quite a bit to the
   attendance shortage. They didn't say attendance was bad, just less
   than previous shows, but hopefully that trend won't continue.
        Anyway, a lot of interesting stuff was talked about such as CD-
   I's future potential, and Boisy's presentation, which I hear was
   great. They also discussed the 68301(is that right?) board shown by
   Kevin Pease and I'm afraid I forget the name of the other person. It
   sounded very interesting, but I'll let someone more informed go into
   detail for those who are interested. Check out the upcoming issues of
   the OS-9 Underground and other magazines which will undoubtably cover
   it in some form.
        New software was also released which is one trend I'm really
   starting to like! :-)
        I hope everyone had a good time at the fest, and hope to
   personally make it to one in the next year. Sorry 'bout the lack of
   transcript this time. I wish there was something I could do about that
   :-(

        Stop in next Monday night at 10:00 pm est. Farna System's will be
   onhand to discuss 'The world of 68k Micros' and his growing line of
   Hardware and software, including the Ken-Ton SCSI system! Keep an eye
   out for this months(late! sorry) schedual.

     Shellplus Path command
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

        I included the command 'path=/dd/cmds' in my startup file, and
   for some reason the system doesn't read this. When I later type Path=?
   to see what paths are specified, it is blank. Am I supposed to enter
   the command another way in startup?
        Ever since I found out that with shellplus, we have a Path
   command just like the dossers, I fell in love. This is very important
   for especially with the two paths(chx chd) to manage instead of one.
   If I enter it on the command line, it usually works out fine, but not
   from startup.

The problem is, the startup file is ran from it's own shell, and then
when it finishes, a new shell is started by cc3go, and this is the shell
you en up as your "console" shell. There is a version of cc3go in the
database that allows you to set up a /dd/SYS/shell.parameters file, which
it will use when it starts up the console shell. This is what you need to
do to get the "path" variable passed to the console shell...

     Supercomm

        Randy, in Supercomm I have my default data directory set as
   /dd/com. The problem is when I go to download, let's say messages, I
   will want to capture them to the MESG directory in /dd/com. So at the
   download filename prompt, I give the path 'Mesg/os9for.txt' but then
   supercomm returns a 216 error. In order for it to work I have to re-
   enter the default directory path again, even tho it's the same thing.
   The first couple times I noticed this, I just saved the supercomm
   defaults with alt-u, but it still doesn't read correctly.
        It worked back when I had a different data directory, but since I
   changed it it hasn't worked, but I haven't done anything else
   different. Have you had this problem before?

Make sure that your default dir is "/dd/com". Having just "com" can cause
the errors you are seeing. Other than that... dunno. Everything worked here
in my quickie testing.

 This is Bill32h today I stuck a 36.00 mz crystal in my COCO III

 I think that the signal from the cassette port is too fast .The symptoms
are


At about 40 pixels from the top of the screen the mouse pointer lags a
little then proceeds to jump to the very top .So I have no access to
those apx. 40 pix without resorting to the keyboard-mouse :-((.


 Question how to slow the signal that drives the port.(If that's even why
the thing is misbehaving)

they changed the value of the ORG...because they changed the speed<software>
in this case changing the Value will fix it,I think<grin> what value is left

    Sounds great. Hope you get that ironed out. Still sounds great. Are you

I made 2 tries in the last couple of days and the msg bounced along with
a nasty-assed msg from the listserver that I was to be ignored. Both
attempts were straight text, typed in while online. When is this system
gonna get a real editor, or issue enough instructs to make this one work?
It bounced the first word of each line like I was attempting to issue
a command to the editor instead of simply entering the text I typed.
When it got to the 10th line (and error) is when I got back a msg that
till someone else sends a re-instatement msg to the listserver I am to
be ignored. Thats getting under my skin a bit, after all I do pay for

   This was the answer that sounded best to me. What does everyone here think?
Might this work? My whole goal that I defined in a lengthy post was to get
NTSC out of the MM/1 (or composite video). I don't care if I trash a CoCo3 in
the process.
