This is all happening on the OS9 SIG. In the last few days
 
   PALM - a UUCP File Utility
 
 was released. I expect the full OSK UUCP package to be released anyday.

Interesting, I'll take a look at that. Thanks for the report.
Which version are you testing? The one with or without 38K Baud??

I just tried out what you discribed. ( read a file done from Capture
while downloading a file ). It works OK here. 
  Can you etell me what your system setup is and a little more detail on 
what is happening. Do you get a system error msg. Are you starting KTERM 
as a seperate process ( KTerm /t3 & ). Ect...ect...ect...

Calvin,
     Found a bug in your math module, all versions to date.  Basic
doesn't like your modules and when loaded in it will say 
4294962194 free when one hits enter after it is loaded.  This also
screws up any source you load that has dimensions in it as any number is 
10 digits long starting with the 429xxxxxxx.  This is Basic V2.4.
    Of course one can just merge the old math with basic so when called
the old one will load in but better if you can fix it.

Date    : 94/02/08  05:52:00

Dear John:
   My system is a MM-1a (68340) running at 16 Mhz.  The modem is a Zyxel
U-1496E which operates at a line speed of 9600 and a DTE-DCE of 38400
baud with Hardware Handshake on port T3.  The problem was produced when
using ME (microEmacs) to read a closed capture file in another window
while Kterm was downloading a file.  The record locking aparently preven-
ted ME from loading the file.  ME hung with a loading file prompt.  I
have tried to duplicate the conditions and so far have found that ME will
do the same thing (hang at the loading file) when the capture file has
not been closed.  I have not yet duplicated the condition during file 
download.  If I come up with more information or if you think of something
else please let me know.     Thanks , George

Subject : KTerm YModem
Date    : 94/02/08  22:18:00

This msg is really to the person that sent me email about having trouble 
using the YModem on KTerm Beta V2.0.
 
YModem on KTerm is NOT YMODEM BATCH. If you select just YMODEM, it works 
correctly. 
  I need to look at the specs for YModemm, to see what the difference
is. If may be a control sequence that is sent tell the receive side how
many files is ready to send. In that case is should be easy to add
YMODEM BATCH.
 Now anyone got a copy of the specs?????
