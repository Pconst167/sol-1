  Hi.  I recently ordered an MM/1 MIDI interface boad, and received it
yesterday.  I installed it following the directions that came with it,
and then ran ultimusek.  Every time I tried to get my MIDI keyboard to
play something it would just sit there doing nothing.  I went back into
my MM/1 and examined the MIDI board with my multimeter.  I found that
the six wire cable provided with the MIDI board was defective.  Out of
the six wires, only 2 passed a continuity test, the other 4 just didn't
make electrical contact with the connectors.  Also after examining the
schematic of the MIDI board and looking at the MM/1 /T1 connector on the 
processor board I found that the cable was also incorrectly wired!  I
removed the connectors, cut the cable off a little on both ends, and
re-installed the connectors as the schematic and MM/1 tech manual
indicated.  The MIDI board now works as it should and my keyboard plays
with no problems.  I'm glad the cable did have continuity problems as it 
might have damaged something due to the incorrect wiring.  I'n not
griping about it, but just thought you would like to know that there may 
be some bad MIDI interface cables out there.  I ordered the MIDI
interface, UltimuseK, MM/1 tech manual and windio52 update disk and
received them in good time, and would like to say "keep up the good
work"!  
 
p.s.  I got to use my MM/1 tech manual the first day <G>!

Yes, I know about those mysterious disappearing bugs.  My mouse stopped
working for a few days, then mysteriously started working again. I know
of at least 1 other person who has had that problem.
BTW, in lieu of real work (until I start beta testing MM1 RIBBS) I am
currently decompiling and rewriting CGFX.  I fixed the screen directory
bug (the one that sometimes crashes the program when you are looking
at a small directory [partial screen]).
I decompile a portion, recompile to verify the accuracy of
decompilation, then rewrite for greater efficiency and compile with GNU
C for even greater speed.  I'm doin this mostly for entertaingment, but
it may earn me some PR. I'll put up a copy for download when I'm done.
