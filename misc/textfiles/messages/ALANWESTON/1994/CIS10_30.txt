Well, maybe this will work.  If you have a Basic main prog, say Prog1, as
follows:
    Dim s1:string[50]

    RUN Prog2(s1)


Then you have prog2 :
   DIM s2:string[100]

   Print "The size of the string: ";size(s2)

Then the correct size WILL be passed PROVIDED the stringsize in the subfunction
is >= the stringsize in the calling function.. Note if it is smaller, SIZE(s2)
will return a Parameter Error.

Hopefully this might help you.. However, you might need to ensure that the s2
IS >= s1.  Otherwise, everything will be OK if LEN() of the passed string is <
SIZE(s2), but if the passed strlen exceeds the capacity of the PARAM string,
then PARAM ERROR is returned.

Ahh yes.  Gimme some GLOBAL variables..  This was one of my biggest gripes
about B09.  If you're trying to write a very large and involved program, and
the bad part about M-W basic is that it is VERY capable of doing so.., and you
have forty-'leven sub-modules, and suddenly you realize you need to add one
more little field to that "TYPE" that occurs in almost every single module; it
seems like you can NEVER find them all <G>.  I think this is about the only -
well one of the very few - aspects that make it inferior to C from a
programming standpoint.

Boisy,

I use Teac FD-55GFR or FD-55GFV, its slightly older twin, on a Kix\30, a QT2
and an old Smoke Signal. Yes, the drive has two speed modes. It may be that one
of the straps needs to be set differently than the default. The two straps for
the high density control are LG and I.  I set them as follows:

              As Received   As Used
     LG          OUT         OUT
     I            IN         OUT


You might try these settings.  (If you want more information on the strap
settings, try Teac's fax line for information.  Its number is (213) 727-7629.
According to my October 1993 index, the documents on the 5 1/2 GFR drives are
No. 5004 and 5007.)

Good luck getting the drive going.

Ken

Hi Ken!  Long time no talk.

By OUT, I presume you mean un-jumpered.  Well, both LG and I are
unjumpered on this drive.

I couldn't even format a 1.2MB floppy until I removed the jumper from DC
and stuck it on RY.  Then, I could format and read a 1.2MB floppy.  But,
I still could not read a 360K formatted disk (CoCo), hence the Error
#247's.

Just called.  It's 7am here, so I should have the docs in my fax bin
when I get to work.

Thanks!

Daniel thanks for the advice!

As for PC's, yes their nice, but honestly it would cost thousands to replace my
CoCo software on an IBM system. I figure I'm set for life with my CoCo, backups
and old Rainbows. Regards, Steve

So far as execution directory is concerned, I just kept all my commands in the
one directory (CMDS)..  it got kinda big, but this seemed simpler to me.

Many programs will change to the correct data directory itself, or you can do
so within the program... If not, just chd to the correct directory before
executing the program.  The same thing for the execution directory, if it is
different.
