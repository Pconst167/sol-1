I'm not as ancient as you, but I'm creeping up there at 35.  I started
with an MC-10 in 1982.  I bought my first coco2 about a year later. Joined
the Erie County Color Computer Club a month after that, which I am still a
member.  I bought OS-9 level one when the price was first discounted about
1985 or so and have been using it ever since.  I took APL and Fortran in
high shool, and "structured" BASIC in college.  I hope this fills your
need for info...

Just one thing occurs to me...  my guess would be that this
"Sony" drive may be some other, standard drive that Sony has
stamped their name on.

  In any case... before you jettison a drive that may be
of value to you...

   you may want to try the following:

   Tell your format or setup software that this is a 20 megabyte drive,
with 4 heads and 612 cylindars.   For almost ANY MFM drive can
be formatted AS IF it is such a drive (provided it IS 20 megs or bigger).


   Er... this IS an MFM drive, no?   It has a 34 pin and a 20 pin
connector on it?
   (Of course, with that configuration, it COULD be also an RLL drive,
which is not important, for all RLL drives can be formatted as if
they are MFM drive, and it also COULD be an ESDI drive, which would
cause problems, for ESDI drives require an ESDI controller.)

The 6 pin "connector" is probably a jumper block. 3 pairs most likely set the
SCSI ID number (binary setting), The other three  probably control other
options, such as parity enable, moter start mode, and maybe termination power.
Tis stuff is pretty standard on SCSI drives. If you knew someone with a MM/1
or a DOS machne, they would be able to format it without the need to know
the other parameters.

Hi Paul. The Sony has a 50,6 and 4 pin conn. The 4 pin conn pins are

Here is some more info so you don't have to ask. 1.- I tried different
joysticks, same result. 2.- If I boot without nitros9(old boot) but with
nitros9 upgraded grfdrv, no problem there, works without a problem and
the grfdrv upgrade is much faster then stock. 3.- I tried many cc3io
modules that match nv115data and no good. 4.- All this is in low-res
joystick. I haven't got to the the hi-res yet, but will try that when
I can locate(this table is a mess right now) my hi-res adaptor. I'm
using standard joystick ports(not serial) and problem is same L or R.
5.- Problem exists all games, klondike, shanghai, smash.
   If you don't have these problems in lo-res joystick, what versions
of CC3IO/GRFDRV did you start with? And where did you get them? What
I can't understand is where the nitros9 modules listed are obtained.
Okay, I have found a few but most of what I have and could obtain, they
don't match the sheet(Nitros9 printout). I have converted all modules
in my boot by using mostly original(tandy) modules. This has now
become an obsession with me. I really hate when this happens because
I won't do any other work until its solved. I'm a real sicky that way.
Tenacious is one word and stubborn. I think that is the correct spelling.

Well I tried a few games last night and had no problems. I don't have
Klondike, is that the commercial  Solitaire from  Color Systems?  At any
rate, some games used Low res joysticks, others were high res mouse. As
a final check I started up Multivue and sure enough the cursor arrow jumped
off the screen when I got close to the right side of the screen. However
even tho I couldn't see the cursor, clicking the mouse at top and bottom
of the screen did scroll through the pages of icons in some directories
   I didn't have any games, including mahjongg, which required me to have the
cursor close to the screen right side, so Mvue was the only screeen where I
had a cursor problem.
   When I made all the Nitro 1.15 modules, I got the exact CRC values that
were listed in the docs. When I upgraded to 1.16, again everything jibed.
Hope you get this straightened out before Nitro 1.20 becomes available.
I can give you a list of the crc's but there will be system differences
due to hardware. I'm using a B&B interface, Disto SC2 controller, etc. I'll
read your 2 messages off line again, and perhaps post more if it looks like
it will help

I'm probably wrong but I believe that the only two modules involved here
are CC3IO/GRFDRV. Even the docs mention possible incompatibilities there.
If you can tell me the modules you used for those two, I'll see if I can
match them. Also, is there any other module responsible for cursor control?
If so, then I can play with that module(s). I'm not very deep in knowledge
here so thats why I ask. I find it hard to believe that I'm the only one
with this particular problem. As I said in my earlier message I used the
stock modules for cc3io/grfdrv. Let me look for my HI-RES interface and
I'll get back after I test that mode. Thanks again, Charlie

     Crashed Coco3
     From: NEALSTEWARD  To: ALL

I have a 2 meg coco3 with a 6309 installed, an MPI with Disto Super
Controller II, Ken-Ton SCSI interface, Ken-Ton Dual Comm pak and a
2 mHz Speech/Sound pak plugged in, along with 5.25" and 3.5" floppys
and an 85 meg HD.  (Catch my breath...)  Now the problem is my system
crashes at powerup most of the time.  If I plug the floppy controller
in the expansion slot directly the same thing happens.  Seems like the
floppy controller?  I plug a working tandy (and hard drive specialists)
floppy controller in the exp. slot and they work.  If I plug them into
slot 4 of the MPI, they crash the system.  If I put the RGBDOS ROM in
the SCSI pak and switch the MPI to slot 3, it boots just fine.  Now I
put the ROM back in the SCII and placed it in slot 3 with the SCSI pak
in slot 4.  It boots and I have floppy access, however I get spontaneous
system crashes while using this configuration.  CAN ANYONE HELP???
I have tried swapping just about every piece of hardward and get
different results every time.  Also under ECB without anything in the
exp. slot, I have no ploblems at all.  I have recently upgraded to a
1987 GIME and installed a new exp. slot card edge connector, since the
old one was cracked, I thought that would fix the hardware problems.

Neal, I have almost the same setup. I have my SC-II in slot4(RGB-DOS), my

If this doesn't work then someone else will have to bail you out. I know
this is what RGB-DOS expects, it definitely looks for HD in slot3, floppy
in slot4. Good luck Charlie

One thing that I just learned by trial<much
 Try taking a Q-tip and a get it damp with a little isopropyl alchohol
and clean all the connectors on the card edges of any paks and the
Multi-Pak itself.
 I suggest this because I recently had the rs-232 pak drop characters
after I had removed it and re-plugged it in. Drove me buggy until I
cleaned the edge connectors using the above procedure.

 Hope this helps. Remember, you don't want to get the q-tip soaked,
just enough to clean the connectors.

Thanks Charlie, but thats the way I've run it for years.  It seems the
problem is more recent, but I think it began to get flaky BEFORE I
installed the socket for the 6309.  There just seems to be a sudden
compatibility problem between the SCII and slot 4 of the MPI and the
SCII and the expansion slot.  SCIII works fine in other systems and IS
working in slot 3 of the MPI (go figure???)

I tried cleaning all the connectors and card edges.  I used a dry cleaning
solvent like what you'd use for video heads because it doesn't leave any
residue.  It is (sort of) working right now using the unusal
unusual configuration I described in my previous message (SCSI in 4, SCII
in 3, SSP in 2 and RS232 in 1), but tends to crash now and then.  The
way I ran it for years now CRASHES on power up EVERY time! (ie: SCII in
4 and SCSI in 3)  This one has been driving me nuts for months, but it
is probably something so obvious I just overlooked it.

sounds like a bad connector,related only to the SC II in Slot 4...if the

How long has this system given you problems. You said you replaced the
exp.slot connector because it was cracked...how did it get cracked?
Did it maybe damage a card that was plugged in at the time? Stop, take
a breath and take everything one step at a time(make only ONE change)
and see if it works. This way you may eleiminate the problem.

Well if you can't tell me where to find the version to '.ipc' then I'll have to
wait. It doesn't seem to be what I show as the 1.15 version. I didn't have
Nitro before 1.15 so I don't know if Ed 31 of RBF existed before that.
   I know it will be a bit of work, but could you compare the RBF module that
I have from 1.15  CRC FA84C1  size 12AE, with what you say is needed for your

what the
problem is, but I think that some of the code, if it is read by the terminal

Aha!  Now I see the source of the confusion!

The "pre" and "post" have to do with when the incrementing is done
relative to grabbing the value of the variable as the result of the
expression, not when it's done relative to other statements.

  i = j++;

assigns i the value of j and then increments j, while

  i = ++j;

increments j and then assigns i the (changed!) value of j.  In either
case, the incrementing has to be done before the processor starts to
execute the next statement, and it isn't done until the processor has
finished executing any previous statements.  (In the case of a statement
a little more convoluted than the above examples, there can be "places
by which everything has to have been done" within a single statement,
or as ANSI calls them, "sequence points": function calls, comma
expressions, && and ||, and ?:.  But the principle's the same.)

Go to the libs, the Programmer's Den I think, and download Rick Adams
cc program. It is configurable to use rma and rlink instead of c.asm and
c.link.

There are several ways:

1) rename rma in your cmds directory c.asm.  You'll also need to use the
   new linker for these files, old linker won't work.  Rename rlink c.link.

2) use a file editor, "ded" is good, and edit "cc1" to look for new names.
   find the sequence "c.asm", followed by '0', change to "rma", next char=0.
   change "c.link"+0 to "rlink"+0.  Don't have to fool with anyth that would
   follow.

3) Get a replacement for "cc1".  There are several, many are in source form
   where you can compile new "cc" yourself, some already look for new
   versions of asm/linker.

Just be sure that you use new linker to link "rma" output.  The new linker
CAN link ROF's compiled by old assembler, though.

I use ++i syntax all the time. Not fer sure, but I think it actually
generates more efficient asm than i = i + 1. And I never, ever mix up
incrementation in an expression like:

i = j++;

For the most part, this is safe, but something like:

i = j++ >> 8;

may or may not work like you think it should. All compilers are not
created equal!!! :-)

 If you're using the 3.2 compiler then the two expressions do result in
 different assembler.  The "cntr = cntr+1" generates an extra move operation.

 Using a register variable for the counter in the loop:

 3.2:  cc -xiat=/r0

 for(cntr=0;cntr<100;cntr++)

     moveq.l #0,d4
     bra     _7
 _5
     addq.l  #1,d4
 _7
     moveq.l #100,d0
     cmp.l   d4,d0
     bgt     _5

 for(cntr=0;cntr<100;cntr=cntr+1)

     moveq.l #0,d4
     bra     _7
     move.l  d4,d0
 _5
     addq.l  #1,d0
     move.l  d0,d4
 _7
     moveq.l #100,d0
     cmp.l   d4,d0
     bgt     _5

 Ultra C, OTOH, generates the same code for both cases:

 Ultra C: cc -ebe -td=/r0

 _$L0
     moveq.l #0x0,%d0
 _$l321
     addq.l  #1,%d0
     moveq.l #0x64,%d1
     cmp.l   %d1,%d0
     blt     _$l321

     Ramdisk
     From: VE3DAC       To: WDTV5

I just picked up all the ramdisk messages here and will read them offline.
However I unarc'd Myram  and the help file has your trademark <g>. At any
rate, do I just install your driver in place of rammer and keep using
my /r0?  I gather that I can change the size of the ramdisk to most any
value I want, anytime I want? with dmode?  Since I still have 512K, my /r0
is set at about 100k, but I would like to make it larger from time to time
and then go back to its smaller size. I have never had a problem with
Rammer, but my understanding has always been that once initialized, that's it
What other advantages does myram have?  Since I don't need a mega ramdisk,
should I even bother changing?

   Soon I'll tackle quoting, it would help for this message.
I don't understand how the ramdisk doesn't need to be initialized.  I can't
use the default 1 meg size, so I assume the size will be set in the
descriptor. The driver and descriptor should be in the boot, no?  I'm sure
that you used Rammer at some point in your Ccoco career and that is where
I'm coming from.  If I deinit the Ramdisk, change sct using dmode then
wouldn't I use init to restart it?
  Don't be too brief and assume that I'm on your wavelength.

     RE: Ramdisk (Re: Msg 88138)
     From: WDTV5        To: VE3DAC

Ok, Merv. Rammer did need to be formatted I think. That was its "initilization"
I guess, I never could get it to work for me, mainly because of the BLOB
problems I was also having back in the early years. So I settled on the
combination of /r0 and Ram.dr from the developers pack. Not everyone has
that descriptor, but I think there was another lookalike in the database
at one time, or you could make it with dEd after saving one of the other
floppy descriptors as "R0.dd". Then use ded to change the drivers name
from cc3disk to ram (don't forget to set the hi bit of the last char, in
this case the "m") so os9 can find the name correctly. Then check the offsets
in the book, and make the "sectors @per track" a large value, say about $200.
You could even use ded for that.
Now the reason it doesn't need "init" or format, is that the init code is
in fact the entry "init" lable in the driver format according to the os9
manuals. All that really needs to be done is to set up enough of the "first"
sector to enable rbf to get the device characteristics, establish the
correct size file allocation map which may be more than 1 sector if the
"sct" value is about $800. Then a skeleton fd sector is established in the
next sector after the FAT, and a $40 byte long "root" directory built in the
next sector after that one used for the fd (file descriptor) sector.
A small drive only needs 3 256 byte "sectors" to do that, the rest of the
disk is then nothing more than memory allocated to this task! OS9/RBF handle
the map switrtching (switching) to keep the memory linked into the taskmap
according to the absolute seek value RBF keeps in its own buffers for the
device. Format doesn't count! When a "normal" file open is done instead
of appending the @ sign to the device name, rbf keeps track of the length
of the file and prevents you from reading past the end of file into garbage
data in bare memory thats not yet been written to. Since you can't read
what you haven't written, no formatting is required, and there is not in fact
any of the normal housekeeping sync bytes etc used on a real disk in the
ram disks memory area. The rbf maintained seek pointer does it all.
To recap, you'll need a descriptor whose driver name=ram, and whose "sct"
value is dummied up to the $200 area. This will give about a 100k disk
if my memory is working. You can deinit it if you want to change the size,
so that the new size will take effect on the next open file operation that
references the device.   Thats all there is to it. Cheers Merv, Gene

An addendum after re-reading it off-line. Yes, it s/b in the boot, else
wastes 8k of valuable system ram to load after the fact. The default size
is whatever the descriptors "sct" value is. The effective minimum should
be considered to be 8192 bytes or 8k. Don't dforget to sub the 3 sectors
(768 bytes) used for the stuff rbf needs. The value set in sct is the
number of sectors at 256 bytes per sector. $200 then is (grabbing calculator)
512x256=131072 bytes. For some reason, mine defaults to $1e8 sectors.
Not quite enough to run dchecks buffer on my 125 meg/1 sector per cluster
hard drive! So I have a script that runs it at the right size.

There are several ways to master it. One.- Read the Tandy docs concerning

for you would be Interactive Windows. If you do it either way, you'll
know for next time you need a window. Also, you can make a window with display
but again you need to read up on it. If I give you specific instructions
on how to make a window, I need to know what kind of window, Text/Graphic.
Also how many columns 40/80 if its text. You see what I mean(I hope!).
If you have two windows at startup, one is /term. The other was created
in the startup file. Check the file to see how it was done. It probably
is the easiest way. Good luck. Charlie

OK--I'll give it a try.  (I say that because I may forget something.)

Anyway...first thing to do is an mdir.  Look at the output for names like
w1, w2, w3, and so forth.  If they're in there, you have several windows
already, you just need to know how to use them.

The easiest way to use them is by running a command and redirecting its
standard paths to them.  Actually, it's even easier than that, because
you can use "/w" instead of naming an explicit window like, say, /w3.
That way you don't have to look and see what else is going on and
say to yourself something like "Oh, yeah, did I start a terminal
program in /w4?  OK, I'll use /w5 instead."  With /w, you just have
to type, for example,

    osterm /t1 <>>>/w &

and there you go with osterm running in another window.  For shell,
there's the -i option, which will keep a stray <ESC> from ending the
shell, so with the shell, you'll typically want to do

    shell -i=/w &

to fire up a shell in another window.

Here's where the tricky part comes in, though: for some reason that
I don't know, stock OS-9 has the various window descriptors set to
come up by default in weird modes: 16*32, 12*80, etc.  Some programs
say "by golly, I'll make this window what I want it to be," so they
don't care what the device descriptor says, but others, like the shell,
don't do that.  You'll therefore probably want to modify those device
descriptors so that they all do something a bit more reasonable by
default.  I had mine all set to 24*80 text windows by default.

There may be something in the download areas here explicitly set up
to make the window descriptors all 24*80 text windows by default; I
remember using such a thing.  But if there isn't--heck, even if there
is, it's useful--you'll want to look for a program called "wmode."
wmode does for windows what xmode does for plain old SCF devices.
Once you have the descriptors all the way you want them, make sure
their CRCs are good, save them, and make a new bootfile.  Then you're
all set.

If you want something else running in it use:

  Ok, here is my 2 cents worth. :-)I have a shellscript called "nxtwin"
which I use in my startup file to open 2 windows besides my '/term'.  I also
use it for getting more windows "on-the-fly".
I utilize 2 utilities within my script, both of which can be found here in
the databases.  One is called "getnw", this goes and gets t very next win-
dow in lin: if you have /w1 and /w2 open  it will get /w3 f yo  No
specifing of the descriptor needed!  The other utility is called "ni",
and what it does is sets the priority to what you spe.
  Please excuse the way this looks, I am receiving random characters, most
likely a noisy line.
  I forgot to tell you about another utilitthat I use, it is called
"datamod".  What it does is takes your shell scripts and makes them into a
data module so ty can reside in memo and be readily availab.
  Here is what my script file looks like:

 getnw 0

   nice 30 shell pat/dd/cmds /dd/cmds/filetools /dd/cmds/hdtools <>>>%%0&
   echo
   echo Window %%0 ind

  I really hate this line noise at times like thi am not sure b from
my vantage point right now, there is an extra line in the above script.
There is a line th 5 dots after the line "getnw 0".  If it is there when
you read th ignore it for it does not belong there.
  Anyway, this is just anoer person's way of doing something which happens
to be a most logical and efficient manner for me.  Hope you enjoy.

  Ok, once again, here is my 2 cents worth.

  I use a shell script for doing my windows, it is called "nxtwin".
I have it in my startup file twice to open 2 windows beside my
and it is used for getting the very next available window.  The
other is called "nice" which is used to set the priority to a spec-
ified value on any process.  I use a value of 30 for the shells I
have started in each window.  This seems to suit me best.  When I
am "on-line" as I am right now, I want my terminal program to have
most of the processor's attention.  It runs at 255, while everything
else is set low.
  Anyway, these 2 utilities can be found here in the databases.  I
have another utility that I also use called "datamod".  It is used
for creating a data module out of script files so they may reside
in memory.
  Here is my script:

  getnw 0
  nice 30 shell path=/dd/cmds /dd/cmds/filetools /dd/cmds/hdtools <>>>%%0&
  echo
  echo Window %%0 initialized

  I also use "nxtwin" when I need windows "on-the-fly".  Just type
it on the command line and I have another window to work in.  I hope
this might help you.  See ya.

     RE: OSK Software (Re: Msg 87987)
     From: DBREEDING    To: MRUPGRADE

Terry,

I've been following this thread and would like to provide a little
input, just a few of my observations, not necessarily gospel, of course.

I've fooled with a CoCo for about 12 years (+/-), been involved with
OS9 for maybe 10.

I've just recently gotten an OSK machine - about 3 weeks - and am still
in the process of acquiring software.  From my initial perspective, it
looks like in most areas, there is the equivalent software for it as you will
find on a Level 2 OS9 CoCo.  It seems that a lot of the stuff is implemented
as well - some better, due to the lack of memory constraints.  I've only
touched the surface of the software.  The only thing that *MIGHT* be behind
here is in terminal software at this point; but this might be due to my lack
of familiarity with what's available.  I now have Sterm - very good - but
lacking the bells & whistles of a true telecom package.

I'm not sure if your stance is that BOTH OS9 AND OSK are lacking in apps
but I've been able to find about any app for OS9 that I have ever needed.  I
think that this will be true also for OSK; I feel that at this point, OSK
is at least on an equal to OS9 in the area of bells & whistles in about any
field, and some are already ahead; I feel this advancement will accelerate
geometrically.  I do believe that more and more attention will be given to
OSK than OS9 as time goes on.

Some of the software I find attractive are:

Ved/Vprint - Have CoCo version, fantastic.  You can utilize all your printer's
capabilities.  Going to get OSK version.  I understand it does even more.
There are other good text editor/formatter combos also.

"IX" - automatic offline-reader-type comm package specifically for Delphi &
CIS.  Have CoCo version - because of IX, I know very little about navigation
cmds for Delphi <G>.  Again, getting OSK version, again... even better.

Don't know if you are into BBS comm or not.  Many have a format called "QWK"
packets where the selected subs(topics) are compressed into a file, you d/l
them and then offline you read them, make replies or compose new msgs, then
they are compressed and you upload them.  There are some for the CoCo -
have one and it works quite well.  I got ATP for OSK, got it here, and it
is also great.

So you see, we have many bases covered.  This is only a small sample of stuff
available, just what I've found useful so far.

I think this will improve as time goes by.  It's already getting better.

To be honest, I probably would not take the responsibility of recommending
OS9/K to a 100% computer illiterate person.  However, I would like to add
that while I have never had any experience with a PC, from questions I've
seen posted on BBS's and from problems I've heard from friends, a PC will
not run by itself, and some people have serious problems getting the PC's to
do what they want them to do, so I'm not sure the PC is the cure-all.  For
you, I don't know.  If you can successfully use OS9, then you should not
have any problem with an OSK machine.  For myself, at this point at least,
I'm really impressed.  The speed is worth a bunch.  Again, no one system is
right for everyone.  I think that the OSK system will provide everything I
will need (the CoCo could too, except I am not really good at hardware
work, and when the CoCo starts to break down, there will come a time that
it will be hard to get replacements).

Sorry for being so windy...

From my expreiance with "PC's", most people that get them, get them all
pre-configured, and set up for them by someone else "in the know" and they
never really get the system set up the way they REALLY want it, just because
they never went through them first initial steps. While I don't own a
PC myself, I have set up, or helped set up several for friends, and I find
them nop easier to set up then a OS-9 or Unix box.

there is learning curve one must go through on ANY computer!
I upgraded to a 486 33 meg and having to setup games for the kids can be fun!
If one has a lot of programs in conventional memory .like Stacker 4.0..
PC kwik....Etc ...they hog the lower memory! one can get around it by loading
them in high memory,BUT! when one uses MEMMAKER <dos 6> it only sees ONE set
of programs to load high,SCREWING up the other sets that one boots with
another Batch boot program that came with DOS 6........because of that one
has to setup the other Blocks MANUALY by hand!
because of the Memory problems......MAX Memory for normal games....
CD-ROM mode for CD-ROM drives....one has to max lower memory for EACH set!
Memmaker do not allow that!yet it came with it!<grin>
It do remind one of the 64k memory max problems with the CoCo,yet we are playing

with 640k here!I finaly got how to do it!BUT! had to do it by hand,something
some people would not be willing to do,some programs will NOT work unless one is

willing to get inside to get it to work right,that goes for OSK/OS9...machines
the CoCo or the IBM clones and MACs......I had to use the driver that came with
the CD-ROM a CR-563...Why! because the Software from Soundblaster works ONLY
with their drive also a CR-563 but! NOT made by the same company....
BOTH drives are the SAME! but the internal electronics are NOT!
So if one is playing with OS9 or DOS <IBM> one still has to put up with problems

caused by different ways of doing the SAME thing differently!<grin>..no matter
which platform one uses...................

The only hardware knowledge you had to have with early MM/1's was how
to mount the boards in the case, as they came unassembled.

Nice synopsis, David!   Truly a good outline of the state of the market,
and the point about the PC is VERY WELL PUT!.    I recently made an easy
$150 when I was called for a consult about a sick PC.  Seems the original
vendor set the EEProm default to deny control of an address line to the memory
management programs.  This person installed Windows, which installed the memory
manager in her machine,
 thus adding an error message on startup - drove her nuts!  PC's as a class are
NOT EASIER to use than OS9 machines.  Never have been, and never will be!
Yes, many programs can be used "off the shelf", with very little experience
with the OS required.  V
ery true.  But, if you try to mix many of those "ready to run" packages
together - you had better plan on learning to work the machine!    I might add
that I had several friends who owned DynaStar.  I wish I could have afforded DS
at that time.  It was eas
y to install, and powerful.  I think that Terry denied himself a real pleasure
by declining that purchase!

Terry, there are now, have been, and always will be those people who can't
change a spark plug.   How many people blame that on Detroit???   I have no
ability to solder at all, but have assembled "cable together" type stuff for my
CoCo all along.  I have a
ssembled PC computers.  I had NO difficulty at all with IMS's instructions on
assembling the MM/1.   I don't want to say a defective user is responsible for
all problems with all computers everywhere, but neither does one users
inability to assemble an MM/
1 mean that the engineer or marketing team for the MM/1 are lacking in ability!
Get real.   You can tell some of the people some of the time, and most of the
people most of the time, but you can tell all of the people NONE of the time.
That's a simple
fact of life.  And my experience with the MM/1 community is that IMS did manage
to reach the vast majority of the people most of the time when it comes to the
assembly instructions.

I wouldn't call him a defective user either.  I know it is possible to have the
simplest instructions and still have someone screw it up.  A recently released
software package was given some bad "reviews" by an individual ("the package
is broken..").  Turns out that the individual had his system set up a little
different than most of us.  I have done the same thing also with software.
That is what is great about the SIG.  You can ask without looking (too) foolish
to others.  I've done it on occasion (looking foolish that is).  BTW, PC
software installation instructions has lines like (paraphrased) "when running
and XXXX error appears, the installation was incomplete/defective/missing
files, etc".  Un huh.....easier to install.  Yep. (grin)

David, I've been following this thread with interest. I've been using IBM
compatibles since '83 or so and have never thought of them as easier to set
up or use than my CoCo's or MM/1. The problems are just different or pop up
at different times. Installing "standard" cards can be a real pain because
of the IRQ's. Many times I've had to re-address a card or change the interrupt
because of a conflict with something already in the machine. Getting the CMOS

copy of the settings. I'm often called both at work and home by people with
either software or hardware problems who need help. ALLof these people have
IBM compatible machines.

Also, regarding Dynastar, I've owned it since the OS-9 level one days. I really
like the program and upgraded to the level 2 CoCo 3 version when Frank made it
available. Even before my MM/1 was delivered, I bought Dynastar for OSK. I own
and use Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 and Wordperfect 6.0 on my 486's. I like
WinWord a lot but still use the MM/1 and Dynastar quite a bit because it's
much easier to use. After I got OS-9000 I called Frank and asked if he had
Dynastar available for it. He said no but that it should not be too hard to
port since it was written in C. He also said he had no intentions of porting
it at that time. I hope he changes his mind because I'd sure buy it.

Just my 2 cents worth.

Exactly as I see it.  Just this week, a friend who got a PC mailorder - had
it maybe 4-6 months - it wouldn't boot from the HD.  They called the
company's tech support and got no help whatsoever.  I believe they went
through the setup procedure and got it back to working.

I betcha if mine quits like that a call to Ed Gresick (or Frank Hogg or
David Graham for the other systems) will get it back up quickly (barring
a hardware failure).  I didn't set mine up, it came preconfigured, but I
don't think there will be any problem when the need arises.

I had 2-3 reasons.  For one thing, I've done Coco-OS9 for maybe 10 years
and am truly impressed with the system.  I had to see what the "next
generation" was like.  Secondly, I've been online for maybe 3-4 years, and
I have made the acquaintance, if only in print with many, of a whole bunch
of great people, and would hate to leave their company.  Thirdly, it may
be trivial, but I'm a real fan of the Motorola chip, the 6809 and now the
680x0.

I looked seriously at going to a PC or maybe a Mac.  In my research of the
Mac, it may have been my lack of understanding, but the word "crash" seemed
to be popping too frequently for my taste :-).  Some people view the PC
as the cure-all, the ultimate.  You may have already been there, but if not,
get on a PC-related BBS.  If you think _WE_ have troubles, listen to them..

I wound up getting a Delmar System 5.  So far, I'm totally thrilled with it.
I do believe that choosing either of the currently available 3 offerings -
Delmar/Peripheral Technologies, MM/1, FHL would be a tossup.  Each system
has its strong points, although each "strong point" would probably be a
minor advantage in any case.

Your comments re: setting up PC's and others was quite well-put.

The trouble with so many people is that they think that all that is required
to do is set a PC on the desk and let 'er go.  That's OK if all you want
to do is write a letter or 2 and do a checkbook account.  However, if you
really want to get everything out of your computer, be it PC or any other
machine, then you're going to have to find out about your system, or find
someone who _DOES_ know.

You know, one thing I have thought... I know the 64K limit for the CoCo was
something of a nuisance, but with this, we _KNEW_ our limit.  I am totally
illiterate on the PC, but to my understanding, isn't this 640K limit
cumulative?  Doesn't each program in memory use part of this till it runs
out?

I think that these are very common reasons for folks to make the decision
to get an OSK system as their upgrade path from CC3 L2, but I have never
seen them expressed so well and so concisely.

A few weeks ago, I attended a three-day "Software Testing Seminar".  One
thing that the instructor mentioned in one of his anecdotes was
that while testing/debugging a "record/playback" testtool his company
produces, they encounterred some problems interfacing with the Mac.  Turns
out that it was due to a race condition in the basic Mac firmware regarding
interrupts.  Apple eventually acknowledged the problem as a day-one bug,
but fixing it would require recalling all of their Macs...  Dunno if they
have fixed it in new production or not.  This race condition is probably
one of the gremlins behind these periodic "crashes".  (One of my
colleagues came over the other day and commented that his had just crashed
for the second time that day, losing all he had been working on...)

We are in thunderstorm season now so I shut down my system when I'm
away, but my MM/1 typically would go for weeks (24 hours/day, 7 days
a week) without even a manually initiated re-boot.

I agree -- I have an MM/1, but when asked by two folks in the last few
months which system to get, agreed with one that the PT68K4 was right
for him, and the KiX was good for the other.

My Mac does not seem to have a problem with crashing, but I'm still very
happy I've got an OSK machine (MM/1) as my primary machine.  On the Mac,
you can do background printing and multitask with many programs at one
time, but it's discouraging to watch your background printing halt every
time you pull down a menu or click somewhere on the screen.  My MM/1
doesn't do that!  :)  OS-9's real-time pre-emptive multitasking is much
much better.

I really gave my decision a great deal of thought.  I've been in the
process of making up my mind ever since the MM/1 came out, and did a lot
of "soul-searching", I guess you might say.

Really, you are probably at least a small reason for my loyalty to OS9.  If
you remember maybe 4 or 5 years ago, you were still in the process of
releasing scsi47, I had just gotten my HD and was having trouble getting it
to format, (too dumb to remove the parity jumper <G> ).  You went to a great
deal of effort to help me get a version of scsi47.  Things like that are
hard to forget.

 Right.  I think I would have been quite happy with products from any of
 the 3.  The only disadvantage of having this diverse market is that at this
 time, it looks to me like it may take a little doing to get advanced
 features like windowing to work across all platforms.  it seems to me that
 at this time, to be 100% compatible, the software will have to be strictly
 text-oriented???

 Thanks for your reply.  Not meaning to put them down, but your comments
 regarding the Mac make me think that I may have made a good decision in
 not getting one of them, at least for now.

They probably are not all that crash-prone.  It just seemed to me that in
Mac discussions, the subject of crash-proofing software, and such made me
a little leery.

This was one thing that made me kinda give up on the Mac.  When I asked
one salesman about whether multitasking was pre-emptive, and how it worked,
although he wasn't all that literate on the subject, it led me to believe
that OS9's multitasking was much better.  This is one feature that I would
sorely miss.

 Your description was just about as I had imagined.  The CoCo-3 has a
 pretty good memory arrangement.  The only thing I could see coming was
 the fact that System Memory Area was beginning to get full.  I ran into
 Out of Sys Mem a few times myself, and I think the ones pushing the system
 harder than I had been experiencing this for some time.

  Just my 2 cents worth...  It is quite funny you should mention memory
limitations on PCs.  I just learned something about that this past week.
From the way I understand it, there is no 640K limit on a PC.  That limit
is with MESSY-DOS.  OS-2, on a PC recognizes ALL available memory on it
and uses it for any programs.  There is no 640K limit with OS/  I think
that with MESSY-DOS it had something to do with backwards compatability.

For the most part, the "Information Age" does provide information in a
usable manner. But EPS files (Encapsulated Postscript) were never promised
to be very manipulative. Especially by Joe User.

Nah, all you need is a word processing program that handles files in

     Boot disk woes
     From: MROWEN01     To: ALL

Someone please help me. I can't seem to create a bootable disk to save my
soul! I'm using os9gen and the build goes OK but I get a FAILED BOOT message.
I'm using OS-9 on a Coco 3 with 512k. I am using some modified modules that
have worked in the past. I'm also confuse about the windint and vdgint modules
and what they really are. Right now I can't seem to mix the modules I want on
the same boot disk. Maybe someone can give me a working list to try. I want
to run Multi-vue, SACIA, B&B drivers, and PCDos/RSDos (CC3Disk?) on one disk.
Is this impossible? Even the most basic modules won't seem to create a bootable
disk. All of the altered modules I'm using are from FARNA systems PatchOS9 kit.
Right now I have two disks I can boot from. One has the new CC3Disk that
allows me to run PCDos / RSDos, but now Multiview. The other allows Mutil-View
and SACIA operations, but not PCDos RSDos.

     I keep the startup info on the hard disk. The only thing besides the
bootfile on the floppy is the CMDS directory with shell and grfdrv. I
have some understanding of what different modules do, but I have no clue as
to how they can or cannot interact.

Yes, and no. I'm finding that 1.115/1.116 Nitros9 seems to be different for

say that "Well, I changed the at/rv & ty/lg in mine so its properly
identified as native mode, 6309 code by "vfy". I could. But then what do I
do when the 1.15 someone else has is nearly $B0 bytes longer than mine?

Sooo, the next upload of the .ipc to make RBF.mn edition #32 will be based
on the original edition #28 from my distribution disk.  As will any other
updates of system modules that I manage to do. Maybe this will ease the
confusion factor involved in trying to track upgrades. Since I'm Nitro'd
here, that means I'll be crossing the border that divides nitros-9 from
os-9. At this point, the hassle factor has me in an I don't care mode.
I'm sorry if that offends either Chris or Wes & Co. Each of us is in it far
more for the love of the system than for any prospects of making any money
on it anyway, plus the copyrights are MicroWares, not Burke & Burke, Gales

     Mail Order Sales Tax
     From: PAGAN        To: ALL

 Senator Dale Bumpers (D-AR) has introduced legislation (S.1825) that may be
 of interest to the OS9/OSK user and business community.  This legislation,
 would require that mail order businesses collect sales tax on all orders
 based on different exemption schedues and rates depending on where the order
 is to be shipped.  This would have to be collected even if the company had no
 presence in the state.

 Because OS9/OSK users rely much more on mail order than users of the
 government's approved architechture and operating systems this bill could
 have a large effect on the cost of your software and hardware.  It would be
 to your advantage to let your congress critter know how you feel.

 The bill is sponsored by:

I'm getting a case of deja vu. Didn't congress just try this about
two years ago? I expect Computer Shopper will be helping lead another
charge against it, along with other computer magazines (many whom depend
heavily on mailorder advertisers). Does congress really think we'll
"not notice" this time?

Also, I expect that even if such a bill should pass, it would be
challenged on constitutional grounds.

It is interesting that a senator from my state is sponsoring the bill.
I'll have to remember that when he next comes up for election.

 I think Congress has tried to sneak this kind of stuff past us every year
 since the Civil War (snide reference to the Income Tax :-), but now they
 have a decidedly anti small business president to help things along.

 Probably so but...

 June 13, 1994 (No, not the "Simpson" Murders...)  The Supreme Court in U.S.
 vs Carlton decides that Congress's _retroactive_ changes to the 1986 Tax
 Reform Act were constitutional.  Justice Scalia notes that due process
 rights are an oxymoron (!) and that all retroactive tax laws will henceforth
 be valid.  (You only _think_ you've already paid your taxes for 1981)

 Not off the point but a bellwether of the kind of protection we can expect
 from the Supreme Court when it come to new ways for our government to extort
 money from us citizens.  Kinda makes you feel warm and protected don't it?

No, there is no standard function to rename a file. Go figure. I wrote

Joel:

Ultra C has a rename() function.  If you want to write one, here is
the prototype:

#include <stdio.h>

int rename(const char *old, const char *new);

Since the C 3.2 compiler doesn't support const, leave that out of the
parameter list.


If you need help writing it, let me know.

 You'll have to do it yourself.  If your talking about changing the directory
 entry, you can either fork 'rename' or try opening the directory file and
 changing the name yourself.  I'd opt for using 'rename' myself :-)

 If you want to change a module name, it's a little more complicated.  You
 have to load the file into memory and use _mh._mname to locate the current
 name.  If the new name is the same length or shorter than the original you
 can rewrite this field.  Otherwise you'll have to put the new name at the
 end of the file then update the file size and name pointer.  In either case,
 you'll have to update the module CRC and header parity.

What if you aren't using a constant character pointer (such as a pointer
to malloc'd memory)?  (I guess I've just never seen the "const" keyword
before.)

That's what I was afraid of.  I have been using the "rename" utility for
now.  I may just leave it like that, although I may have found some
rename C source code thanks to a friend.

Ah, excellent.  Now I don't feel so bad.  <grin>
It works fine... I guess I was always told to try not to have to rely on
external utilities, so when I resorted to running the "rename" utility
instead of linking to some "rename" library function (which should
exist), a little "warning" flag popped up in my brain... :)

Ken sent me the blarslib, and I'm looking at that code as well.  My

You can actually do a rename function by opening the directory file(s) in
a NONSHARED mode and changing the filename, but this requires a good
understanding of the structure of a OS9 directory file.

Yeah, I was thinking I would do that, but I stuck with using OS-9's
built-in rename, as my program was just a simple utility anyways.
Although, I'm not sure you would need to open the directory in NONSHARED
mode, provided you opened the directory file in "update" (read/write)
mode and read in the directory record to be renamed, changed it, and
then wrote it back out... I believe OS-9's record-locking would keep
things safe.

Paul, unless you have an updated(?) version of 'blarslib.l', do NOT EVER use
the included 'link()' and 'rename()' functions.  This library was written
prior to OSK V2.4, and therefore these routines do not take into account
variable-sized sectors.  Using them will cause corruption of any disk
(including hard drives, of course) that were formatted with sector sizes
different from 256-bytes.

I believe that Bob's code for these functions was also used for some
versions of the 'os9lib.l' library.

In other words, caution using any libraries with these calls.

Mike Haaland did an update to these library functions to fix the problem,
and last I heard (over a year ago), was planning to contact Bob Larson to
get permission to release it.  I have been using a "mv" command based upon
his update, and his sector-size fix works fine.

Cheers... / Ken

Dunno where I heard it, but someone said sometime that when you want to modify
a directory file yourself you need to open it in Single user mode for some
reason. Why not test this and report back to us the results! ;-)

Zack,

  Like any other file, it all depends on what you want to do to the directory.
OS9's record locking is sector by sector.  If the read-modify-write you
want to do stays within a sector boundry (such as this rename), then the
record locking will cover for you. But, if you want to read in the whole,
possibly many sectors long, directory, sort it, then write the whole thing
back, you'll need to lock the file yourself with the no-share bit.

Maybe that's how it was under 6809 Level II, but under OS-9/68000,
record locking is not dependent on sector boundaries.  Here's some
quotes:

"Read and ReadLine cause lock out of records only if the file is open in
update mode.  The locked out area includes all bytes starting with the
current file pointer and extending for the number of bytes requested."
  -- Microware OSK Tech. Ref. manual

" (part of an example) 'Process one reads the first 100 bytes of A' ...
With record locking in place, process one would have locked the first

everything properly.

I have an "mv" command... How can I be sure it's not the wrong version?
DCheck does report a large (and increasing) number of "Sector xxxxxx
(byte=xxxx bit=x) not in file structure." errors, and I've never been
able to figure out why I keep getting more and more as time goes on...
or what the errors really mean, for that matter... sigh.

Hmmm... that doesn't sound good.  My hard drive is not in very good
shape right now, either -- but for a rather different reason...

  "Quantum LPS105, Drive /H0" created on: Jan 6, 1992
  Capacity: 205524 sectors (512-byte sectors, 1-sector clusters)
  13619 free sectors, largest block 43 sectors
  6972928 of 105228288 bytes (6.64 of 100.35 Mb) free on media (6%)
  22016 bytes (21.50 Kb) in largest free block

That last line (largest free block) is really a nuisance.  It's dropped
down as low as 14K a couple of times, until I delete stuff.  Wouldn't
want to use a tool like Speedisk to defrag it unless I had a recent
backup, and I really don't want to back up 93.7 Meg to floppies <whince>.
Currently shopping for another drive.  I wanted to buy a tape drive from
Mark in Chicago, but he didn't make there.  I tend to have to delete
files when I start a new project, just so I have enough room to work...
Haven't installed anything I brought back from Chicago yet.

BUT, even at that, here's what 'dcheck' says about it:

  Volume - 'Quantum LPS105, Drive /H0' on device /dd
  $0322d4 total sectors on media, 512 bytes per sector
  $645b bytes in allocation map
  1 sector(s) per cluster
  Sector $000034 is start of root dir
  Building allocation map...
  $0034 sectors used for id sector and allocation map
  Checking allocation map...

  'Quantum LPS105, Drive /H0' file structure is intact
  264 directories, 5200 files
  98255360 of 105228288 bytes (93.70 of 100.35 meg) used on media

Everything seems to be in order -- even after 2.5 years of use.
So you've definitely got a problem somewhere.  Don't know if it would
be the version of 'mv' that you're using -- it could be many things.
(Like there's a version of 'arc', the file copier, that doesn't work
with 512-byte sectors, too.)  I don't really know how you would determine
if 'mv' is the culprit, other than trial and error, checking with 'dcheck'
after using it.

Yeah, 93.7 MB would be quite a backup!  :)  I still have 16MB of my
120MB hard drive free (5MB in largest block), so I'm still ok there.  It
would be nice, as you say, to get another hard drive, and a tape backup
system, though!

I get everything that is above, but right after "Checking allocation
map..." I get about 8 screens (it used to be only about 2 or 3 screens)
of "not in allocation map" errors, which is to say the least,
distressing.  But, just like your capture above, dcheck finishes up with
a "file structure is intact" message... bizzare.

That's what I thought I'd tried before, without success.  So I don't
know about mv being the culprit, but I can't think of what else would be
causing it.  But, this reminds me, I'm due for a backup.  <g>  I only
backup important stuff (like sources) and skip the directories with
GIFS, SOUNDS, and such, so I end up only having about 30 or 40 MB to
backup... still quite a bit, but doable.

Joel,
  I don't know if this is related to your allocation map wierdness
or not, but I have an intermittent problem with my second hard
drive.  /H0 is a 170meg Seagate - never a problem.  /H1 is a 40meg
Quantum.  Sometimes after a cold boot I will find that I can't
access some of the files on /H1.  Dcheck will report lots of errors,
much like you describe.  The first time this happened, I thought
the Quantum drive had "bit the dust".  After some fiddling, I discovered
that a cold restart (power off, power on) fixed it.  Dcheck then reports
no problems at all.  All I can figure is that the Quantum is a little
slow spinning up to speed, the system boots from the Seagate, and tries
to read the Quantum before it is ready, stashes some garbage in memory
where it won't go away even after a power-on reboot.  There is a
built-in cache in the Quantum that may be involved too.  So far, the
problem has never produced any "real" damage to /H1 files.

  I should mention (for anyone comparing this little buglet with
something on their machine) that this is an MM/1a, 9-meg, and the
Quantum drive is one that was originally sold by Radio Shack as
an upgrade to the Tandy 3000.

  We need some brave volunteer to write an OSK driver for one of those
relatively cheap messydos tape drives that plug into the parallel
port. (Any Takers?).  Everything on my hard drives is backed up
(sort of) -- that is it all exists SOMEWHERE on a floppy.  I could
rebuild the system from floppies ---  in about a week (groan)

  I've got no problems with it.  I do use it, and dcheck the drive at

Just to keep things neat <g>.  See if yours is the same.. if so, I
don't `think' that this is the cause.

I use the same version of "mv". Due to this discussion, I ran dcheck for the
first time (drive is three years old). Dcheck reports everything is perfect,
so I suspect this version of mv is okay.

At the risk of reopening this can of worms (I apologize for my late entry
into this debate, but I just returned from several weeks in Europe, including
Switzerland), I would like to point out that the Bill of Rights had NOTHING to
do with hunting, sport shooting, target practice, weapon collecting or any such
trivial pursuits.  The right to bear arms was clearly aimed at preventing laws
which disarmed the public from defending against ANY enemy, foreign or DOMESTIC<

who  threatened any of the other listed freedoms.  In other words, it preserved
the right to bear arms against men -- not deer, geese, ducks, paper targets,
stc.

The Swiss clearly understand this concept by virtue of their requirement that
EVERY adult male learn the use of arms in a mandatory stint in their defensive
military establishment.  We could do well to learn from their example.  It is
not
an accident that the Swiss have been recognized as Neutrals in every armed
conflict of this century.

Actually, the Swiss have been recognized as Neutrals in every armed conflict of
this century (and I beleive the last 2 as well!~), because during the later
middle ages, Swiss Pikesmen slaughtered a large number 3KVVZg a
variety of wars.   They
killed so many people that their armed forces are respected to this day.  In
fact, for the 14th century, the pike was considered roughly equivalent to our

I take it that you ge the login shell, but your startup is not executed?
If so then make sure that startup is on the default drive (/dd), since
the shell looks for it there (and it's called startup).

As far as loading and running programs from the startup script a sample
would be useful.  If you just want to load it into memory try this:

 load /dd/cmds/program_name

If you are trying to run a program from your startup script it gets more
complicated.  If it's just a single program (and you don't need the terminal
shell) simply rename the program autoex.  After running the startup script
the login shell looks for /dd/cmds/autoex and executes if it finds it.

If you're trying to run multiple programs from the startup script then
what you do depends on whether the program is interactive or not.  To
start a second shell put this line in your startup script:

 shell i=/w4&

This will start an imortal shell in the fourth window.  To start another
type of interactive program (say KbCom) try:

 kbcom <>>>/w4&

which will start KbCom in window 4 (providing that nothing is already running
in that window).

I hope this gets you started, if not let me know.

     C question
     From: ALWAGNER     To: COLORSYSTEMS

     I am currently involved in translating an engineering program written
in Q-BASIC into C.  This is then to be compiled and run on an Intel 486
based system running UNIX.  Since that last "foot in mouth" episode, I
have gained a great deal of respect for your C programing abilities and do
not wish to create a similar problem to the one that started that thread,
that is running out of stack space and/or memory.  I am developing the
translation on my Lvl II Coco3 using Ansifront to allow ANSI C to be used.
My question is that since this has the potential for becoming a large
program by Coco standards, is there a way to "chain" programs together as
is done in BASIC or to say it another way, to call another seperate
program into memory, pass parameters to it, have it execute, and have the
called program pass info back?  I think I understand function calls, but
aren't they part of the calling program, as far as memory is concerned,
once the compiling has been done?  The idea here is that no one program
would require more than 64k.  The solution should be something that could
be carried over to the eventual platform for this endeavor which is the
above mentioned Intel 486 running UNIX.  Thank you for your time and
consideration of this question.

Why is the development being done on a CoCo as opposed to the 486 machine?
Doing the development on the CoCo severely limits you in many respects to
what you can do.

No, there is no "chaining" facility in CoCo C, but you can implment it
using data modules for shared data and forking child processes to execute
the chained module. Big mess. Not recommended.

I would recommend in this case to use the 486 to develop the app.

Well...there is a CHAIN command in BASIC09, which is essentially a hook to
the F$Chain system call, but that does NOT leave the caller around to
get information back from the other program.  (F$Chain is sort of like the
bad movie in which a process goes on to certain death so that some other
process can live. :-)  You can spawn another process without having to die,
and under Level 2 the child process will get its own address space, but it
will have to pass any information back via some mechanism such as a data
module it shares with the parent or a file it writes for the parent to read.

     OS-9 hacker community..
     From: ILLUSIONIST  To: ALL

Well, the standard media representation of hackers (those that break into
systems, commit credit card fraud etc) must exist in the OS-9 world..
I recently "discovered" a program called CCv.. on some old PD/shareware
disks in my local CoCo club.. still in its .PAK file.. from what I can
see that program somehow "generates" credit card numbers..or, validates
an existing number.. it must do it all internally, with some sort of
algorithm.. (they come out pretty fast, so it cant be that complex, probably
some "check-digit" or "CRC"-type thing..) ...anyway..I just figured I would
post a message about it.. after thinking about the numbers it generates,
I doubt they even work because all the systems would call the credit guys
to run a credit check, and make sure the card isnt over the limit..and,
this program doesnt list exp. dates....well, at least we know what "tastefull"
hackers are using.. a CoCo running OS-9 .. :) ..I wish whoever wrote this
included source, I would like to get a look at the algorithm..

The algorithm is very simple, indeed.  I will try and look it up for you
soon.  It has something to do with adding up every other digit on the
card and dividing by a number, if I remember correctly.  Whether you
started with the first or second number depended on whether there were
an even or odd number of digits on the card.  The algorithm has been
published in "2600 - The Hacker Quarterly"... the rather controversial
hackers magazine.

Rammer was a ramdisk driver/descriptor package written (released) by Kevin
Darling for os9 level 2 back in 1987. Its been used by some for compiling
as the compiler executives "cc" whose latest variation is cc_2_5_2 as
inter-program file storage, faster than a floppy by far, and somewhat faster
than a hard drive. I just submitted "myram" as a replacement for it.
Rammer, as I understood it (I never did really) needed formatting before
use.  myram doesn't, just start writing to it. Its still faster than a
hard drive, but not by a lot if the hard drive is quick. Mine can do
the test program called "megaread" which does just that, reads a megabyte
from the drive and times it, in 13 seconds. But I can recall when my old
seagate 238r was 67 seconds too. Handy? Like that well known button on the

Humm, didjA TURN on the zmodem option in supercomm? If not on, it doesn"t
monitor for the *0000 string in the incoming data. On receipt of the trigger
string, it then forks rz (for receive) and goes to sleep till rz returns.
Ditto for sz, but in each case, it appears that delphi is the one issueing
the start trigger strings. The syntax to delphi is to enter "zd #,#,etc"
when you"ve "read" the file. the pair of ## assumes ythere is more than
one file in this family, as listed on your screen, and you want to dload
number # and number # of the list. Hope this helps. Looks like latin at

     CoCo/OSK C compilers
     From: DBREEDING    To: ALL

Here's a little "feature" of the MW OSK C compiler I _BELIEVE_ I've
stumbled across.  It could be common knowledge, but I'd never heard of
it myself.  Seems that with a structure, from what I can determine, a
block of characters joined by an int, float, and ???, will have a
character added if the total for that blockof characters is odd.  This
won't hurt the program, but would cause problems in sharing files with
systems that don't do this.  I found this by trying to port a prog from
the coco to OSK.  I was looking for int's, but was surprised in the
filesize incongruity with structures containing only floats & chars.  It
seems that the following will result;

  * char a1[x];char c1[y];int b1 : if a1+c1=odd, one byte added, same
  *        if int b1 before the two.
  * char a1[x];int b1;char c1[y] : if EITHER a1 OR c1 = odd, one byte
  *      added, if both odd, 2 bytes added.

  * sizeof() reports correctly the actual size, reflecting any
  * additional bytes added.  If this is news, and anyone wants to
  * play around with it, here's a little routine for it.

 struct {       /* Play around with the order of the elements...*/
  char a1[24];
  int b1;
  char c1;
 } S1;

 char a2;

 main()
 {
    printf(" Size of S1   : %d\n", sizeof(S1) );
    printf(" Actual Size  : %d\n\n", (int)(&a2)-(int)(&S1) );
    printf(" Totals of els: %d\n",
          sizeof(S1.a1)+sizeof(S1.b1)+sizeof(S1.c1) );
 }


Another difference between the CoCo and the OSK compilers, although
insignificant, I suppose, is in mktemp().  The OSK mktemp checks the
directory for a unique tmpfile name, probably doing an "Open".  It exits
with Error #216 in "errno" - Coco doesn't.  I like to end a program
with "exit(errno)", which looks kinda messy.  Guess I'll either have
to cleanup after mktemp (and others???) or do an exit(0)      <G>.

Well...I don't know if it's common knowledge, but it's true.  Here's
the reason for it: the 6809 is perfectly willing to load an integer
at whatever address.  The 68000 will take an error 103 (address trap
error) if you try to load a 16-bit or 32-bit quantity at an odd address.

Because of this (and other considerations--for example, a 68020 is
willing to load a two or four-byte integer at any address, but it
takes longer), the ANSI C standard says that a compiler is free to
insert padding between fields of a structure or after the last one
as needed to satisfy the alignment requirements of the structure's
members.

Opinions herein are solely those of their respective authors.

I didn't know why.  I'd assumed that possibly the compiler wanted to store
data 16 bits at a time or something like that, but you explained it quite
well.  I realized that was not a bug, and there was probably a good reason
for it.

I thought I'd post this in case someone else was dumb enough to try to
make portable files <G>.  It seems that it would be quite difficult to
forsee this padding and try to compensate for it.  I would assume that
if you modified your program and perhaps added a char somewhere in the
middle of the data area, then all subsequent structures would probably
reverse the padding effect??

Do you have to take this odd-mem thing into consideration if you are
writing assembly code, or does the assembler take care of this?

That may be it, they may not know but are not willing to admit it.  I've
been on CIS for quite a while, and often people come in asking questions,
in the OS9 or CoCo forum, and comment on the helpfulness.  Many say they've
already been on the PC-related forums and sometimes are handled even rudely.

I did go into the Mac Hardware forum over there and several there did try
to give some helpful info.  Those people were quite nice, I'll have to say.

up, but do you have hardware handshaking turned on?  You know--RTS/CTS.

Are you using SACIA?  This might help, if not.  If I'm repeating stuff
already mentioned, please bear with me.

Gene Krenciglowa tried out RBF32 on his Powerboost 2.03  and it won't boot
with your RBF. I'll get his message onto floppy and see if I can get it to
you in mail.
   I used to do that, no problem,  but the last couple of times when the        
        CR
at the end of the line is sent, Delphi stops accepting the message. We'll see
what happens tomorrow afternoon.
   I booted up with one of my old Nitro disks, and the Nitro RBF is a version
of RBF30.  Maybe you missed it in version 1.15.  But I was able to Undel a
file, I just forgot until I tried it. Now I don't know which RBF to use, I'm
loyal to my hacker pals, <g>.
  Look for further, Sun night.

     scsi system
     From: JBMANNING    To: ALL

Hello

I would like to know who is handling SCSISYS by Matthew Thompson.
about a year ago or so I sent my $22 dollars in to register my copy.
and have recieved a couple of updates through delphi after being a pest.
but have never recieved any thing official ie documention and disks in the
mail saying that I had the official registered version.

My user name on delphi was JIMBM but I had to cancel my delphi account
during the first 5 month of 94. I have opened a new acount under
JBMANNING which may be part of the problem.

ident on my version shows

Header for:  SCSISYS
Module size: $05F8    #1528
Module CRC:  $AC2F3E (Good)
Hdr parity:  $26
Exec. off:   $0016    #22
Data Size:   $028F    #655
Edition:     $00      #0
Ty/La At/Rv: $E1 $81
Dev Dvr mod, 6809 obj, re-en, R/O

is this up to date?  and how can I get full documentaion?

one more thing accelarated handshaking works with my drive (st277n)
but I can't get cacheing to work no matter which order I arrange
modules. after I enable caching my doing a
dmode /h0 dns=80 and
type dir /h0 I get weird characters on the screen.
the docs I have say the cache uses $C000 to $DFFF in the
system map.  when I do an dirm this is the same as block 1, right?
or am I mistaken? can I enable cacheing after I boot?

after the last boot I tried dirm shows
