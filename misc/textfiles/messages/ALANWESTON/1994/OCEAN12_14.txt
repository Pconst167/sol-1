Warren,
    Let me make a correction. It is my Magnavox 8cm515 that doesn't scan 
all the way. Top lines are chopped off. As for the NEC 2a I was wrong in 
thinking it work. It did not sync up. My main trouble is I have 2
computers and only one monitor. Although the cm515 can be connected both 
to the MM/1 and CoCo(using compisite connections) and switch between
them at the touch of a switch.

Paul,
    Since I orginally posted the above I now have a source for Sony
CPD 1302 RGB Analog refurbished monitors. They come with a 90 day
warrenty.  If you want one get my 'orderhard.txt' file from my MM/1
Official download section.  These are reported to be very fine for the
MM/1 according to James Jones of Microware.

I'm not sure what 15" monitors that will deal with the 15.something KHz
scan rate exist.  I've recently purchased a refurbished Sony monitor
through David Graham, but, sharp as the image is (.26 mm dot pitch, if I 
remember rightly), it's no bigger than the CM-8's.
 
You might wind up looking in Amiga magazines, since they, like the MM/1, 
put out the same scan rate as a TV.
 
BTW...a while back a place was getting rid of old hardware, and I picked 
up an old Intecolor device--I've been told by some it's a graphics
terminal, though from looking at the key labels I woulda sworn it was a
computer.  It consists of a keyboard and a BIG, HEAVY monitor.  Does
anyone know if the company is still around, or of a manual for the darn
thing?

There for a while, I was hoping to get a Mitsubishi Diamondscan monitor
that was listed for pretty cheap in a California Digital flyer.  Alas,
when I called, I was told they were out of stock.  The other day, I got
a call back, saying they had some, but instead of the $140 or so the
flyer mentioned, they were talking $250.  Since I'd already committed to 
getting a monitor via David, I said I appreciated the call, but I'd
already gone ahead--you might want to check them out, though.

Well...at Babbage's I saw this Addison Technology ergonomic keyboard
that claimed to autoswitch for XT/AT/PS2.  I got one this morning.  It
feels VERY nice, and the split angled key setup certainly forces good
typing style on one...but despite the claimed functioning for XTs, my
MM/1 doesn't talk to it.
 
Has anyone else tried this particular keyboard?  (Maybe I just got a bad 
one, or maybe it needs that capacitor hack that some folks have said
they had to use to get certain keyboards to work.)
 
More generally, is there any chance that it will be possible someday to
hack the MM/1 to use an AT-style keyboard?  Those XT keyboards are
getting a little harder to find.

  What are the specs required for a monitor to be compatible with the 
MM/1 video?  Presently I have in mind a Magnavox CM2015. This is a 15" 
monitor with Max Res 1280 X 1024 @ 60Hz refresh with a horizontal scan 
of 50KHz.  However I would consider a used monitor if the price is 
within my means.  I'd like a LARGE one preferably something 15" or 
better.  It helps when one can see... %-)

Be careful!  You need to know the *minimum* scan rate as well as the
maximum.  These days monitor makers seem to think the whole world uses
PClone VGA cards, and not many you'll find bother to deal with scan
rates below 30 KHz.  In *Computer Shopper* these days, the only monitor
I've seen that comes right out and says it will do 15.75 KHz is a 27"
monitor that Midwest Micro advertises...for $2900.
 
You might want to check USENET.

Stephen,
     The CM2015 will not work since it has no horizontal scan of
15.75Khz.  You might look around for NEC 5D , those  were I think 17"
size otherwise same as the 3D.  The 3D is 14" same as the Sony's now
available. Same as the Magnovox 8cm515 and 1cm???.

Here is info on useing a Sony 1302 on a CoCo III or MM/1

This message is specifically in reply to a note from Warren Hrach:

YES!  The Sony 1302 WILL work VERY VERY WELL with a CoCo 3,
and it therefore should work just fine with an MM/1, which produces
the exact same sort of analog RGB video as the CoCo 3 in all important
respects.

At least, given your assertion that it is RGB analog, and that it
supports H sync frequencies at 15.75 KHz (the last is critical...
most modern "multisync" monitors don't bother with supporting such
low frequencies!), it should work fine.

If I am not mistaken, the Sony 1302 uses a 9 pin DIN connector for
its RGB video.   The pin out is DIFFERENT from that used by NEC
multisync monitors with 9 pin connectors.   This is worth noting
by others, actually, so I'll elaborate here:

The "Sony Standard" (also used by some Magnavox multisync monitors
from the same or just earlier period) for pin out for analog
RGB is as follows:

   1,2   Ground
   3,4,5   Red, Green, and Blue analog luminance (0 to 1 V p-p,  more or less)
   6,7   NOT USED
   8,9   Horizontal and Vertical sync, respectively.

   Note that I recommend, when you make up your video cable, that
you use 11 conductor ribbon cable, and designate every OTHER wire
in the ribbon cable (including the two outside wires) as GROUND,
sandwiching the 5 active signals (R,G,B,H, and V) between ground wires.
This will give you very good transmission properties.

The "Nec Standard" (also used by Tatung and many other "multisync"
   monitors from the period of the original "NEC Multisync"
and "NEC Multisync Plus" and "NEC Multisync 2" monitors)
is as follows:

  1,2,3  Red, Green, and Blue analog luminance, respectively 0-1 V p-p
  4,5    Horizontal and Vertical Sync, respetively
  6,7,8,9    all GROUND

   Note that I kinda like the NEC standard better, because
if you use the NEC standard and just CRIMP a DB9 connector to
a 9 wire ribbon cable, you get every other line as ground, which
is highly desireable for transmission of video over ribbon cable.

  So, Warren... if you just solder up a cable wired from whatever
is the  MM/1's pin out for its RGB analog 15.75 KHz video connector
to the Sony connector, using the pin out I provided for that,
you should get a VERY nice, sharp impage on that Sony 1302.  It's
really a VERY fine monitor.  If you ever want to sell it, let me know!

Warren,
    Lets hop that they are still around in Jan. after the holidays. I'll call 
up and get the updated ORDERHARD.TXT in the next day or two.  Thanks.  BTW 
what is the dot pitch on those Sony's??
