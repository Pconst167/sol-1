No, I understood you.  AR uses LZW compression--that's how it manages to
shrink stuff (usually--no compression method will work on *everything*)
on its way into the archive.

I have the beta version but if I noticed, had forgotten.  Really, it would
be convenient, but we can live without this feature, I suppose, it's not
all that hard to run attrib.  I believe the OSK version *DOES* restore
file attribs, not sure, but, as I said, it's not necessarily a *HAVE TO
HAVE* feature, I suppose.

David, I disagree. To a new user, setting the correct attributes is one more
major puzzle to be sorted out. It's bad enough having to figure out a foreign
archiver. Then you have to shuffle the extracted binary off to a place OS9
will recognize it as runnable. Some took hours, even days, to figure out that
they also had to "modify" this new binary. Some never did figure it out...
instead giving up in disgust.

  Geeez, and people are always moaning about the lack of user-friendliness in
OS9.

Lha has replaced ar and pak in my system, and it's going to stay that way.  I
get all the convenience and superior compression with lha; ar and pak are on
my hard disk only for backwards compatibility.

Nope, LHa uses much better compression algorithems... I personally
don't think the new version will catch on, since lha does a much better
job now... The main "nice" thing about AR is, it is reasonably small,
and simple to use, and will run on a 64K CoCo. It is something tht can be
thrown on a disk to make easier installation of software that is archived
on the disk (ie, it will extract the fully directory tree, and, at least
with v1.3, will preserve the proper attibutes, not dure about owner ID
number though, has been a long time since I have actually used AR)

Oh well...I guess we need someone with the most "current" shell (that is

I have had no problems with mine except for the new Ar 2.0 compressing a

You might have problems with that... There are lots of little
patches that can be done to shell+ (the patch files that came with it)
to set thing like logging, @ protection, and wildcarding... Yourbest bet
might be to dig up your original copy, and do a "cmp" between them to
identify the changed bytes.

Yes, I did misread that part of your message. People who actually use
Shareware on a regular basis should send some money in for it.

I believe the 90% figure of non-paying users is probably about right, but
I also think that there is also about a 90 to 10 chance that some Shareware
you download isn't worth using at all, a basic piece of $#!t that no one
would ever consider marketing. IMHO, if a piece of Shareware is not good
enough to be sold commercially given enough financial backing then it is
not worth sending in the money or even wasting disk space with it.

And in the DOS world, those 10% still send in the money. I do. Most of the
time, the author is so happy to get the money they send you back better
docs and a more fully featured version of the program. And 10% of MILLIONS
of users works out to some nice bucks, which is one reason why I am in
the slow (I love OS9 too much to make a clean break) process of converting
over to Visual C++ programming for Windows and then whatever "Chicago"
will be called.

 > How many ADOS'es are "burned in ROM",, but not a dime paid,, and that's
 > not even shareware.  But I'd call it used,, wouldn't you?

Now we're getting into a different area. Burning "free", i.e., Art Flexsor
gets no money out of the transaction, copies of ADOS is not merely using
Shareware and not paying for it. After all, even with Shareware the
author actually only "requests" money be sent in as a "contribution to
the cause" (which a lot of the non-paying users use to justify not paying),
but ADOS is ONLY legally available as a commercial product.

 > But most authors will agree with you,, Shareware is at best bettern'
 > nothing but not by much.

Yes, most Shareware is not worth the download time. Some is. When I find
good Shareware, I pay for it.

  As for shareware not used,, , I'd be supprised,, if anyone who didn't
 use it set in money.  Or feel expected to.
  That much we agree on.
  Actually a little more.
  It is very satisfying (as author of HOMEPAC V3.1, shareware),, for thehe
several who sent in money for thehe full support,, andn later version.

  Then there was th e guy inm

I'd have to differ here.  There's some *REALLY* GOOD shareware out there.
I have to admit that I have been a little negligent in a couple of
instances, but do try to send in my donations.

On the OS9 front, we have OSTerm-could have had some polishing, but quite
good.

Tim Kientzles's "view"-  really good and pretty complete

HDKit (I sent my donation but Pete Lyall had moved, messed around and never
re-sent)-about as handy as you can get for disk backup.

It's true that much shareware doesn't get the follow-up support that a high-
paying-upgrade setup would get, but really, most is really cheap in cost.
I think you program, you know what is involved in writing a program.

I've read in Computer Shopper where the author states that some of the
PC software is really giving the high-profile software a really tough
run for its money and, in fact, has caused some of these commercial concerns
to reorganize their selling structure.  I have no gripe with the shareware
concept myself.  If you get a piece of shareware that you honestly don't
or can't use, then just put it aside and you don't have to pay.  As for
the download cost, I don't think that is much, unless you d/l everything
you see <G>.  At 2400 baud, you can d/l 100K in what 8-10 mins.?  What's
that, a buck for online time?  I have to pay long distance so what? another
buck on weekends?  Not too bad, really.  Of course, I realize that if you're
dealing with PC stuff, you're probably dealing with more than 100K, but that
doesn't come to all that much, I don't think.

Really, the one who suffers from shareware is the author.  There are many
well-intentioned people who just don't get around to sending in, and
there's a pretty big bunch who d/l everything and never intend to pay
anything.

Well, not really.  It's nice to do, but to write a really good piece of
material, and debug it, takes a lot of time.  If you do write a good piece
of software, I don't see anything wrong in asking for a little compensation
for your time, maybe letting you get some more hardware with which to do more
or giving you the incentive to improve and enhance what you've already done.

Really, I can understand an author asking for compensation for a decent

[description of being ripped off trimmed]

Yes, that does suck. But, ... I have purchased several things recently,
for example a flatbed color scanner and a Colorado Tape backup system
for my DOS box. Both of those items came "with software". As it turned out,
the scanner came with "Micrografx Picture Publisher LE" (the LE stands for
Limited Edition) and the tape backup system came with "Colorado Backup for
Windows LITE".

Both of these were slightly less functional programs than their full blown
big brother versions. They were NOT "crippled". I can scan full color images,
use all kinds of GFX editting tools and save the scan to any of several
different file types. I can backup files to tape and restore them back.

And, indeed both items came with a card to order the "upgrade". And in BOTH
cases the upgrade costs SIGNIFICANTLY less than if I simply ordered the
product from a retailer.

So, I guess it depends on the product and the manufacturer.

   stuff, BUT the new machines were created with the hope that we would
   have something better and different to jump to besides the PC's when
   we had needs that the Coco wasn't capable of meeting. Now we have
   these machines, and yes a very modest base of apps, but a start
   nonetheless. I hear from a lot of diehards<no offense, I'm one of
   them>, about how bad this comunity's going down the tubes because
   there are things we can only do effectively on the MM/1 and other
   machines but not the Coco. Isn't this the whole purpose of the new
   machines? Being a Coco diehard is great, but hopefully we can all
   learn to realize when we are ready for one of the new machines. This
   lack of realizing is what drives a lot of the K'ers nuts.

True, but, on the other side of the coin, the user has the option of
deciding whether it is useful or not.  And, as the saying goes, "another

is great could be useless to another.

In one sense, especially with people like us OS9'ers, some of whom don't
have direct contact with other OS9'ers, have to obtain their software

good, might not be what you need, then in many cases, you're simply out
that much money.

To be quite honest, I've purchased software that is quite inferior to
something I have download that is PD or shareware.

Very Good Points!   This is actually the correct way to do this.  Since
we're discussing IX, I'd like to point out that by default, IX does, indeed,
send ATZ as the modem reset.  However, you can enter ModemReset into the
config file where you can use any reset string you need.  Also, IX also
allows you to enter any additional ModemInit string you might need.

Apparently the above IS HAYES standard.  Most modems I've had use this
protocol (and my current modem is Hayes and this is how IT does it).

        >>Did you check out my suggestion about not having the modem
   reset string (ATZ if Hayes compat) in the ModemInit string?<<

        Somehow I missed that suggestion the first time around, but did
   followup on it after recieving the second message. At first I thought
   I might have actually broken the curse, but (sigh) no luck. First off
   I never had ATZ as part of my ModemInit string in the first place,
   only ATX4<as well as a few other configurations at one time or
   another>. It was only in my ModemReset string, but I added a new Init
   line of 'ATX4^M AT&F^M' following up on Ed's suggestion, but still no
   dice.
        I'm just going to send IX back for a refund. It's too bad, as I
   know it has worked fine for others<and I really want to get this
   running>, but the program has been cursed since the day a got it.

        First I got it and the IX file itself unarchived with a bad Crc,
   so I had to get a copy of the IX file mailed to me by Mark<or Bill,
   can't remember>.
        Now half the time I try to get IX running it crashed the whole
   system on me, which I suspect is of a bug that won't let it cooperate
   with cc3io, or it might be having trouble with Shellplus<but I fixed
   this already>, or it might have something to do with system ram, which
   I find doubtfull.
        When I am blessed enough to get it running I can't even get it to
   dial the phone<grin>. I guess I'll just wait till I go OSK where I'm
   sure this app will be more suitable<it seems too powerfull maybe for
   the coco>.
        I'm just jealous at all you guys having no problem with it!!

You might try "AT&F^MATX4^M" in the init string, since, the way you had it
before (with the AT&F at the end) may/maynot cancle out the effect of the ATX4.
Also, how exactly does IX crash the system when it does?

        Just tried it...No luck :-(

        >>Also, how exactly does the IX crash the system when it does.<<

        Usually I will load up IX,and then chd to the 'INI' directory.
   Then I'll Type 'IX' at the command line<have the init file named
   default.ini so I don't have to include the -c>. It will then start up
   and give the opening intro screen, but right before it gets to the
   main screen<where you are presented with the prompt>, everything just
   freezes up and those horizontal lines appear on the screen. I can't
   even jump to the other windows because the whole system is crashed.
   Sometimes it doesn't even make it to the first screen :-(
        It's sort of a russian roulette effect. Sometimes it does and
   sometimes it doesn't.

Try taking the "AT&F" out of the init string, as this would be the equivalent
of having "ATZ" there.  What's happening, I think, is that IX doesn't expect
a reset string in ModemInit, so doesn't wait, but goes on to the dial string.
If you want "AT&F" as your reset, put it in ModemReset.  If you want "ATZ" as
modemreset, IX will send THAT automatically.

One other thing you might check. How do you have your [Environment]
directories set up?  Could it be that it is having trouble accessing
one of the directories?  Especially watch out for TempDir.  IX puts a
tokenized file in there with stuff from default.ini (called "default.cfg").
My TempDir is /r0, could it be that you use a ramdisk that requires formatting
and this is the problem?

I hate to see you have to give up on IX, as I feel like it is just some very
minute thing causing your problems.  Now, I must admit that I do get crashes
once in a while, one thing caused by large messages, and Bill is aware of this,
but all in all, it is really neat.

Hey there... Since it seems like you've been on IRC before, maybe you can
help me out with a problem I'm having. I always here about people using a
 /DCC command to transfer files back and forth. Whenever I try the /DCC
command it always yells at me and says "invalid client command"..
I've tried about 10 different servers and it *ALWAYS* says that.. But then
somebody else that7s on the same server I am on says they are able to use the
 /DCC command and transfer files to another user. COuld you (or anyone else)
know what is going on? Someone told me that it might be my account but I don't
know why Delphi would restrict me from using that option, or even if they are
*able* to restrict me from anything like that...

Please help!

P.S. If anybody replies to this, be sure not to type /DCC at the beginning
of a line when writing back. I accidently did this in a couple lines and
had to edit the message because Delphi thought I was trying to use some
kind of slash command.. (and cut off the whole line)..

Wonder how I did that? Someone else (over on the Color Computer forum)
tipped me off a few weeks ago that typing //string at the beginning of
a line would result in /string.

Of course, you still have to take note that you are at the beginning
of a line and take this preventative measure, but it can be helpful.

Okay, sounds great!  :)  I'll make sure to ask for that night off work!
Now, which should we cover... pipes or data modules?  Maybe people

I called today and talked to an operator.  Rebel Assault is "in the

Interactive Games Programming at Philips, so I'll be asking some

  Ya, I would drop some bucks for some of them.  Would be a kick
to play them on the CDi and have friends over <g>.  Couldn't call
them golden oldies, that name is used for some CDi music titles <g>.

  If you want a fast action game, get the `pin ball' one.  That will
have you doing dubble takes.  The screen does some VERY fast vertical
scrolls to show the whole playing field.. and each of the 4 games
has it's own great sound FX <G>.  At the very least, see if you
can play a demo the next time.

  That's the one with the joystick on one side, and the cross pad
on the other right ?  If so, check out the `switchs'... <g>.

     "Going for $299, these new CD-i machines look like a Sega
      Genesis in size."


An odd coincidence: Earlier in the same day I read your message, I
had first seen the Magnavox version of the new CD-i player in a
pic in "Video" magazine. Likely it looks exactly the same as the
Philips player (since Magnavox is owned by Philips), but it was either
white or light grey in color.

Other than going to a top-loading mechanism, I wonder what other
cost-cutting measures Philips took? (I wager the expansion port is
out. No loss to Joe Consumer, but killing any thoughts of tens of
thousands or more of CD's being upgraded to OS-9 computers).

The $299 price is a big improvement, but it would have had a much
larger impact 1-2 years ago.

I'm glad you found a deal. On the basis of your msg, I went to sears today
and snooped thru the electronics displays there. I found one Phillips/Maggie,
model # unk, no literature on it, only on the great and awsome games you
could play on it. I spent 10 mins snooping around the display (with
checkbook obviously sticking out of breast pocket) and got absolutley no
response from any of the sales personell who werre all apparently in a
"stop the shoplifter" mode.  Oh, and after fingering many pieces of sales
price tags stuck here and there, I did finally manage to find one that said
$599.95 . . .
Obviously the checkbook stayed in the pocket.  In case someone from sears
is here, that was at the meadowbrook mall just north of Clarksburg WV.
Gee, I'd like for my CDR-25 (NEC) to get back from Mediavision so's I
could put some kind of a scsi buss switch into the circuit and try to
access it from the coco (provided it works on the Amiga when it comes back)

Yes indeed.  I rent one here in Phoenix at a used video game store for
$6.00/night and buy my own CD's.  They do have Tennis and a few games
for rent but not any of the good music/history/fine-arts/etc type CD's.
They stated that the CD's were hard to find but I get mine at Incredible
Universe.  I like the music CD's because I can play the audio anytime
through my home stereo system and save the fancy joystick interaction
for special occasions. I am now using the machine with an old color
composite monitor once attached to a CoCoII with the video adaptor.
The picture quality is much better than our 27" TV when connected to
the CD-i machine.
I have not yet seen the new cheaper Magnavox model but I saw it
advertised in Game Pro magazine current issue..no picture was in the
magazine.  Can the video adaptor card be plugged into the Magnavox
model and is the Magnavox model cable ready?  Incredible Universe
did not seem to have the Magnavox model ... I did not see one but then
I did not ask anyone either.  The price of the Phillips model was $20
off the regular $499.  The 3DO was demoing next to the CD-i and all
the soft ware was displayed side-by-side.  The CD-i seems to have
3 to 4 times the available software including the new movies out.
The movie prices compare to the tape versions so I think that people
will want them if they buy the machine but I have no idea how many
customers are buying the video card.  I can say that Incredible Universe
had many of them on hand.
                                  Thanks for the post!.

No prob. btw, on my MM/1a, I made my own 5pin DIN to two sets of RCA phono

Yes, I have to agree with David.  I released "scsi47.ar" as freeware, and
after about a year I figured that I was "out of pocket" about $200 from the
online charges and long distance calls I paid for to support it.  Forget
about the number of hours I spent coding, debugging, etc.

I wrote this off as "good will" to support the OS-9 community, and the
"cost of my hobby".

Don't get me wrong -- I figure it was worth it.  I met several great folks
from across North America through their messages and phone calls, including
David himself (Box 412, Route 2, Russell Springs, Kentucky -- right, David?)

The OS-9 "shareware authors" are lucky to break even, let alone make a
profit, IMHO.

I'd say that a lot of our software will remain a "good will" effort to some
extent, but to put in the time it takes to produce good code, it would be
nice to just get back something for the wear and tear on your equipment.
I know I try to do some programming, and it's true that my abilities are not
up to most, and consequently it takes me longer to get something accomplished,
I'm sure, but the time to do all this is tremendous.  Then, as you indirectly
mentioned above, after you once get the program written, there's the process
of debugging and helping people with problems even unrelated to your program.
If you remember when I was trying to get my HD up and running, *MY* problem
was that of not removing the parity jumper from the drive.  (Of course, I
realized that my problem was not with your driver, as I couldn't get the
Disto formatter to work either).

Well, it's now 336 Breeding Rd.  Great you remember, we also met in
Atlanta last year.

Right.  Also, in another vein, most of the freeware authors would also
appreciate some feedback on their work, too.  I know I once released
a program, "gfx3", actually the idea stolen, so to speak, from Dale
Puckett, but I wrote it in ML, and enhanced it.  Possibly it was junk,
I don't know, but I never got one comment pro, con, or indifferent. And
that makes one a little reluctant to do much more.

Ved and VPrint are both available under OSK and work great.  If you are

By far, the best VT100 emulation terminal program is KBCom written by
Eddie Kuns.  I highly recommend it.

Yes, it was originally written under RS-DOS as a BASIC/ML hybrid, and
then completely rewritten for OS-9 Level II with some nice innovative
features and graphics capabilities.  The MM/1 version is essentially a
port of that CoCo L2 code with significant graphics enhancements.  The
RS-DOS version has been discontinued, but the OS-9 L2 version is still
sold through Sub-Etha Software.

     shareware stuffs
     From: WDTV5        To: ALL

The current discussion regarding shareware pleas seems to be rather
optimistic IMO. I just checked the db, and a util of mine with a shareware
plea in it has been downloaded by 62 of this groups members. To date, no
one has forwarded a six-pack or anything else.  So I'd have to say that
the percentage of folks who actually do donate would be less than 1/62 since
so far that one hasn't.
Opinions herein are all mine. Cheers, Gene

Yeah, I know the feeling! My 120 on the coco is up to 50 megs used! And the 345
on the Amiga is 75% full! Some of which I may never attack with lha. Seems time
goes faster and faster to me, it must be up to a measurable fraction of C speed
by now. I wonder if there is a speed limit for it like there is for light?

Hmmmm...don't know what the limit is.  I usually backup all the lha files on to
floppy, then delete them from the hard drive.  Hard to fathom why it collects
so fast.  Heck, I'm still trying to fathom electrons moving millimeters per
second in wires but the electric field propagates close to the speed of light.

Hmmm...  Well, I would be speaking to the manager about that.  And
I can tell you that the Philips Model 220 is $499.95, not $599.95.
Sounds like they need new salespeople.

Don't let that discourage you from getting one of the $299 models.

  I just uploaded a copy of KA9QOSK.LZH .  This is a TCP/IP Networking
software package. It was ported to OSK on a PTK4 68000 16MHZ 4Meg
OS9-68K V2.4 system. It works fine on my MM/1. I am waiting for a network

what do you mean exactly. Is this a SLIP or PPP package? What utilities are
included? Are Telnet, SMTP, FTP, PING and otheres included? I don't have an

     New programming trouble
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

        Ok, I have no begun to add the -f option to the 'Protecter'
   program I am writing and have run into a little problem. The command
   line argument '-f' is the option to have the program read the
   filenames in from a file containing all the names. I call my test file
   'filelist' and I used 'ls >filelist' to create it.
        What happens is when I run the program(run begmain("-f
   filelist")) the program just hangs and does nothing until I press
   break. Here's the new portion of the program I wrote to read in the -f
   arg.

   IF option1="-f" OR option1="-F" THEN
   OPEN #diskpath,option2:READ+dir
   FOR count=1 TO 100

   WHILE NOT(EOF(#diskpath)) DO
   SEEK #diskpath,length*count
   GET #diskpath,name
   EXITIF name="" THEN
   CLOSE #diskpath
   GOSUB 20
   ENDEXIT
   PRINT name
   GOSUB 30
   newname(count)=temp
   ENDWHILE
   NEXT count
   CLOSE #diskpath
   (* --------------------------------------
   ENDIF




   From using Debug, I typed 'print option1' with option1 being the first
   parameter read in from the command line("-f -s or -?") and it returns
   '-f' saying that -f is the value of option1. Ok great, so I try to
   verify by turning on the tracer(tron) and checking each of the 'while'
   and 'if' statements relating to option1. It returns all of them false
   INCLUDING '-f' which is opposite of what the Print Option1 tells me.
   Also when I list it, the '*' shows that the program is stopped at the
   'If option="-f"...' statement.

        Does anyone have any ideas what might be causing this?

OK, if I understand you, you're reading a file generated by "ls"?  If so,
I think you don't need the Attribute "dir" in OPEN,  Now, I don't think
ls would create a fixed-length line, so you couldn't use SEEK, but need to
do a continuous read of the file, and I believe you should use READ instead
of GET.

It looks like you are trying to do a directory read, but from your statement,
what you are wanting to do is read the file generated by ls.

About debug listing showing at "IF "-f ..." (I believe this was it, deleted
these statements from the editor).  Could it be that you have a line # here
and an IF ERR GOTO statement?

     New Conference(Ideas Welcome)
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

        I have been toying with the idea of starting up a weekly or bi-
   weekly Sunday night conference and am interested in some input as far
   as who would be interested in attending and what kind of conference
   are you interested in? I want to start one up and I have plenty of
   ideas that I want to try out, but to do them all I would probably have
   to host about 3 or 4 conferences.
        Here's what I have in mind so far<beside brain cells<G>:

        1. An OS-9 Programmers gathering: This has potential. What I want
   to do is get a conference which will in a sense, be a CLUB where
   programmers can get together and work on a program which could then
   possibly be released as shareware, or an even better idea, IMO is
   donating the finished product to the OS-9 User's Group Library. The UG
   could then maybe earn a few extra $$ from registered shareware(since
   we all know EVERYONE registers their shareware, right?<GRIN>). This
   will serve two purposes. One, it will help bring some more software
   into the community, and Two being able to work interactively in a
   programming team, in REAL-TIME conference will help programmers
   develope their skills, especially us beginners who post here every
   week with new questions. Of course if this does happen, we won't be
   able to use the old excuse "Well Dos apps are created by complete
   programming teams which we don't have." LOL
        Like I said this could be a great conference if we get enough
   active,consistent participants, because of all the different ground it
   covers. Once it starts rolling, it probably won't even need a
   moderator, which is one less thing you will need to depend on<letting
   me take on some other ideas<G>

        2.  An OS-9 Basic Programmers gathering: Same as above but Basic
   only. My Bias is already showing ;-) 'Course if there those who want
   to work exclusively with other languages, I guess theres nothing to
   stop ya.

        3. Programming Help Conference: This is different from the above
   two. It is a convenient conference where people in the middle of
   writing their own programs who are stumped by bugs and other Non-
   Features they can't figure out can bring their questions and broken
   source to a live chat where there are others that may have find the
   answers to their problems, trivial. It is a good way for everyone to
   throw ideas around without having to wait a day or two. You don't even
   have to have a problem. Just show up and tell everyone what you think
   would be a great way  to write the best Text editor, or how to make
   programs more user friendly :-)

        4. OS-9 General Get Together: This is a little similar to Boisy's
   OS-9 Live with some major differences. Currently OS-9 Live is an OSK
   dedicated conference dealing with making use of utilities, learning
   programming 'stuff',and other system specific stuff<tho I imagine
   Boisy isn't limiting it to that, as he has already said he is open to
   ideas>.
        What I want to do with this conference is, for one keep it open
   to ALL versions of OS-9, and while cover a little of the area that OS-
   9 Live deals with, I want to cover more 'external' issues, such as the
   direction of the community itself, new software releases, and
   discussions/interviews with vendors and software authors,General
   chat/help nights for those with miscelleaneous questions, and anything
   else related to the state of the OS-9 community and what is going on
   within it. It would be like a sort of Online Talk Show.  And I'm your
   host, Chris Letterman :-)

        5. OS-9 Users Group Conference: I have my doubts as to whether we
   need an OS-9 UG dedicated conference biweekly, but I do think the UG
   needs to be consistently addressed, as far as updates, or how we can
   contribute and keep it progressing. I am thinking that if we do start
   the #4 conference above, I will just do an extra special edition UG
   conference every 1 or 2 months for UG specific stuff, but I'm not
   sure.

        Those are my ideas. Let me know what you think and we'll reshape
   it and work it out until we can get everyone happy<or as many people
   as possible>. I would like to get at least two of them going since #4
   and a programming type conference is really needed here<things are
   getting too stagnant>.If anyone wants to host one of their own, let's
   hear it. Once things are worked out I can start schedualling stuff :-)

        See Ya

88915 29-JUL 18:49 OSK Applications
     many
     From: BOBROGERS    To: ANYONE (NR)

Although I have been a subscriber to Delphi for a while I am a new visitor
to the FORUM of the Delphi OS-9 area. I have previously been a subscriber
to Compuserve, GENIE, and BIX. Delphi seems to me to be the best deal
currently.

My system is a Hazelwood QT20x, with 2.5 meg of ram, 30-, 60-, and 245-meg
hard disks, 720-k 3.5- and 5.25-inch floppies, a SyQuest 44-meg removable
disk hard drive, four modified Heathkit H-19 terminals, an Anchor Patriot
2400-baud modem, Panasonic dot-matrix and HP LJ4P laser printers, and a
(censored) PC, plus a cheap PC lap-top. The H-19's are modified for umacs,
with more function codes on the function keys. I bought the QT20 in January
1988, and have it rack-mounted with other equipment. My old computer is a
Technico, based on the TI TMS 9900, still working. (Yes, that is four! So
I am an EE.)

Here is my accumulated list of questions, comments, and problems:

1.      I am having problems with booting from a hard disk having 512-byte
        sectors. The QT20 won't do it. I bought the latest boot ROMs from
        FHL, but they don't do it either. When I dissassembled the ROMs I
        found references to the number 256, but nowhere any 512s. It seems
        to me that one possible difference in the later ROMs is that the
        boot will try to find a 256-byte-per-sector drive on the SCSI bus,
        and will fail if it does not find one. I have noticed the system
        booting from the SyQuest (not /h0)! I want to retire the two small
    hard drives and use the one big one. Dissassembling on this machine
        is no easy task. I learned on a PDP-8! It still amazes me what could
    be done with 4-k of ram and a 32-k hard disk.

2.      Will the Teac dual floppy drive work properly with the QT20?
        I haven't found out whether or not the new Teac will work with 720k
    5 1/4" disks or only the 3 1/2" size for 720k.

    Which current tape backups will work with the QT20? I am currently
        using a SyDos 44-meg removable cartridge hard drive for backups.
        Will the cheap tape drives intended for connection to the floppy
        controller work? What about software? Or must I find a SCSI model?
    What about the SCSI DAT? FHL says the old Teac tape cart drive works
    but I haven't seen one available. From what I have seen MicroWare's
    backup software may not be strictly SCSI compatible.

        The SyQuest drive exibits a curious behavior. Using FHL's fbu one
        must press <CR> after about 22 meg of backup file, indicating
        another floppy disk inserted, and fbu will do about 20 meg more.
        I have discovered that OSK provides only about 47 entries for
        file segments, and this is exhausted after about 22 meg. You can use
        one of the PD file utilities to look at that - I forget which one.
        I'll probably move the SyQuest to my other (censored) machine when
        I find a better backup device for OSK. I did have a lot of trouble
    formatting the SyQuest carts.

3.      Does any one have a print spooler for OSK? It seems almost a scandal
        to me that MicroWare would ship a multi-user system with no print
        spooler, and let users mangle each others print jobs! I am working on
        a print utility to print one, two, and four pages per sheet on the
        laser, and will upload it when I am satisfied with it. Maybe I can
        make it spool also! I think spooling would involve a common data area
    the way conf (below) does.

4.      Has anyone else tried a new HP LJ IV-P with the QT20? I have had
        trouble with the parallel port driving the laser; a serial port works
        sort of OK, and maybe it is just as well to use the serial port for OSK
        and the the parallel port for my other (censored) system. However, the
        laser cannot keep up at serial speeds above 2400, despite XON and XOFF!
        And not perfectly at 2400 - drops a character sometimes. More trouble
        with OSK? Maybe there should be hardware control CTS/RTS for serial
    driving the laser?

    Using the parallel port the laser prints only a few characters and hangs.
    If one operates the printer on-line switch several times during the print
    job you can get it to print the whole page. Seems like this must be a
    problem with the ACK signal from the laser not being accepted as an
    interrupt by OSK - too narrow, too fast, wrong timing? I have not
    'scoped it yet.

    In brief, OSK doesn't work well with my beautiful new HP LJ 4-P. Of
    course it works perfectly with the unmentionable system!

5.      I downloaded TEX from Delphi a while back but have not been able to
        get it to work because I can't make any fonts. Makefont says it
        can't find the basefile. It made the basefile OK, and it is there with
        ewr permissions. Any one else had trouble? Where are the files supposed

        metafont (by another name) does not. (Even with full path names.)

6.      TEX will need a "dvi2lj4p" driver for my new HP LJ IV-P 600dpi laser.
        I'll write it if I can find enough information. Or has someone done
        this or planning to do it? TEX to a 600dpi laser should be excellent!
    I want to print the TEX and METAFONT manuals!

7.      I saw somewhere that OSK software for a CD-ROM drive exists. I have
        been delayed on this project because I didn't want to pay for the
        higher-priced SCSI versions of CD-ROM drives, and bought a cheap
        (not SCSI) drive for my other (censored) machine. I have bought several
    of the Prime Time Freeware (largely UNIX) CD's. I had been working on
    talking to the SCSI bus for a 9-track tape drive using a NCR controller
        board, but stopped when a power supply problem damaged the NCR, and
        I could not justify the expensive repair-exchange. It waits for me to
        figure out what is wrong with the NCR board. I wrote a bunch of software

        for my Kennedy and DigiData 9-track tape drives, and it was partially
        working as long as the NCR board was working; and I was going to upload
        it except for a possible problem with about 6 lines of assembly code
        which I got by dissassembly and lifting from another program.

8.      Along the same lines, what about page scanners? I believe that some
        available scanners (for MacIntosh?) connect to the SCSI bus. We will
        need drivers, which shouldn't be too hard to write. I have the SCSI-2
        document from Global. But what about OCR software? Has any one seen
        OCR software written in C for UNIX?

9.      What experience has anyone had with the newer high-speed modems?
        I am waiting for enough reasons to justify a 32bis modem with
        automatic protocol negotiation, such as USRobotics. But modem
    technology is changing so rapidly! It has seemed to me that Zmodem
    has been a better deal than 9600 baud, mostly because some hosts do not
    seem able even to keep up with 2400, let alone a higher speed, and
    the Zmodem protocol for downloading files by using larger blocks and
    not waiting so often for the receiver to respond via satellite, makes
    for faster downloads. I suspect that most telephone traffic is handled
    via fibre optics now anyway. One of the AT&T trans-continental fibre
    optics trunk cables runs through our front yard (easement.) Besides,
    for just talking to Delphi, who can type at 960 characters per second
    anyway!

    I have seen somewhere that the new high-speed modems may require hardware
    (not XON/XOFF) control for full operation. OSK on my QT20 does not
    monitor RTS/DTR/CD &c. See next item.

10.     I am also concerned with the Carrier Detect signal from my modem in
        answer mode for log-in as a remote user. OSK does not concern itself
        with a loss of carrier, and if anything happens on the line the remote
        user may not be able get back in because the host OSK monitor may be hun
g.
        Bad, bad OSK! Yes, I know about the carrier loss signal available in
    c, but I have not figured out yet how to implement it.

11.     It continues to annoy me that OSK Version 2.4 has been available
        to everyone else for several years, but not yet for the QT20. I am
        told that it has ANSI C. Although I have downloaded them I do not
        have GNU C or C++ working. I need help from a better software guru
        than I.

        I did receive version 2.3, but conf, working on 2.2, does not work
        on 2.3, and I haven't figured out what changed in the C compiler's
        or OSK's handling of a program common data area from 2.2 to 2.3. We
    could use a "wall" utility.

12. Has anyone been able to get Peter Dibble's software for accepting
    PC formatted disks to OSK, in the OS-9 Insights book. I typed the
    whole thing in and tried to compile it. No goot! Was this for the
    CoCo?

That's enough for now! I look forward to comments from anyone. HELP!

.About your modem question. I just bought a US Robotics modem for my CoCo3
. It's a 14.4k modem. Got it for about $140.. I don't have any flow control
being used and it works just fine and dandy. If there's a big program, I can
call into delphi direct and download it with my CoCo at 1200 cps. If I use an
IBM to download it with ZMODEM then it goes at about 1700 CPS

Whoosh.. long message/list that was... I'll try to answer some of
you questions here (I filed the message off for downloading and can try to
findout other answers later)

Let me startout with the modem/serial port problem with no DCD or RTS/CTS
handleing... This MAY be a problem in the driver you have, or the perticular
UART the QT20 uses... (BTW, I'm not specifically familiar with your hardware
setup, just working from my general OS-9 knowledge) You should contact
FHL (Frank Hogg/FHOGG here on delphi) and see if the the hardware is
capable of supporting these signals... if so, and he doesn't have noew
drivers that support them, the task of adding the support shouldn't be
too much... The Drivers on my MM/1 support all modem signals on at least two
of the ports, so it can be done.

Don't know of anyone useing the "cheep" floppy type tape systems on any
OS-9 systems... You can find great deals though on 1/4" 250 meg Archive
Vipers though (a friend of mine just got a used one for 125$ shipped)

In order to use a CDROM, you really need the CDFM  (I think that is the name)
module, which is a CD File Manager... Someone is working on this for the MM/1
from what I heard. When it becomes available (Through Blackhawk Enterprises)
you could inquire on getting it through them (I don't think it would need
modification to work on you specific hardware, but you might need to modify
the scsi drivers)

Welp... my memory is fadeing on what else you asked about, so I'll cut it of
here... It seems like a lot of you questions/problems pertain to a lack of
specific support from FHL pertaining to your hardware... I think there
was someone else on my BBS that had the same system as you, if I can figure
out who it was, I'll ask him to get in tough with you through Mail.

 Well, it was big and my answer is even bigger <g>!  I've been hard pressed

 Dr Bob,

 >   sectors. The QT20 won't do it.  ....

 You said you were not running version 2.4 of OSK but an earlier one.  The
 prior versions of RBF only supported a single sector size, 256 bytes.  In
 order to support 512 byte (or larger), the driver and bootrom had to resort
 to 'trickery'.  The driver would be set to read and write 512 byte sectors
 to the HD but receive and/or send 256 bytes to the bus.  The first 256 bytes
 were handled and then the second if needed (or the reverse order if you were
 interested in the second half of the 512).  Care must be used in defining
 the sector to be written/read.  The preceeding was accomplished successfully
 by most OEMs.  Similar code has to be put in the bootrom.  I assume you
 booted from another device, formated and loaded the files you want onto the
 512 byte/sector HD (including making a bootfile for that drive).  You'll have
 to get back to Hazelwood/FHL for a correct bootrom or, write and burn one
 yourself.  The bootrom doesn't use RBF so it doesn't have any restrictions.
 If you can't find reference to 512 (or 511) in the bootrom code, I'd suspect
 the bootrom.  BTW, RBF in version 2.4 and later of OS9 supports logical
 sector sizes from 256 bytes to 32768 bytes in integral binary multiples
 (256, 512, 1024, etc.).

 These drives are designed to work with the 37c65 series of chips and to
 use either the Quick 40 or Quick 80 format.  I don't know if they can be
 made to work with a 1772 (or similar) chip.  Software will be available
 for these drives one of these days.  This is an in-house project running
 as a background task with a very low priotity.

 > .... From what I have seen MicroWare's backup software may not be strictly

 MW's backup software was designed specifically for SCSI tape units and, with
 one limitation, has been quite reliable in that service for many years.  I
 have one customer who is running several VME systems; MIZAR and MOTOROLA.
 One dates back to around '86 or so and he's still running either version 2.0
 or 2.1.  The tape back up works reliably and the tapes produced are inter-
 changeable with the other systems even though they are running later versions
 of OS9 - up to 2.4.  If there are problems, they will be found in the driver
 which is the responsibility of the hardware OEM.

 The limitation I mentioned is that a given file may not span more than 4 or
 5 backup medias.  This really isn't a problem considering the large size
 tapes available but if you try to back-up to disks, the maximum file size is
 limited.  I don't remember whether this problem occured with 'fsave' or
 'frestore'.

 > 3.  Does any one have a print spooler for OSK? ....

 Yes, MW does have one as do several other providers.  I think there may be
 some in the databases here and/or on CIS.

 Sounds real good - I would be interested in such a utility.  Will this be
 like 'enscript' on UNIX?

 What is 'conf'?

 I'm using a HP LJ IV+ with my SYSTEM IV's (68000 @ 16 MHz) and SYSTEM V's
 (68020 @ 25/33 MHz) as well as 'my other (censored) system' running OS-9000.
 One of the IVs goes to the printer via the serial port at 38400.  The other
 machines go through an automatic parallel switcher (but I have fed them
 directly - occasionally I have problems with the switcher).  The serial port
 uses a 68681 and does provide CTS and RTS.

 Assuming the chip (68230?) is OK and your cable is good, it sounds like a
 software (driver) problem.  How does one of the cheapie dot matrix printers
 behave?

 I've not had problems with any laser printer nor have any of my customers
 reported any - many different brands are being used.  I have had and customers
 have reported problems with dot matrix printers - this involved dropping
 an occasional character.  I have been unable to reproduce consistantly the
 problems reported or that I had.  Nor, was there any commonality as to
 brand or model.  I ended up with 2 drivers - one looks for the printer ready
 signal and the other doesn't.  One or the other has always solved the
 reported problems.

 Well, as I tried to point out, the problem isn't with OSK but with the
 driver.

 > 5 & 6 Re TEX ....

 Can't help you but if get a driver written for the 4+ (or 4P) I'd like to
 try it.

 CD-I (RTOS) is probably what you're referring to.  The drivers could be
 modified to read conventional CD's.  Also, Carl Kreider is writing (or
 has written) a CD-ROM driver.

 I've started working on software for a page scanner.  Since this is an
 in-house project, it is a 'back-ground task with a very low priority' <g>.
 For now, I use a FAX machine to do my scanning - crude but adequate for
 now.

 I haven't but if you find some, please let me know.

 I'm using only 14.4, v.32bis, etc. fax modems both internal and external.
 Serial ports are set at either 19200 or 38400.  I've had almost no
 problems with BBSs at 9600 - DELPHI is fine at 9600 and CIS has 14400.
 I agree that for on-line conferencing, etc., 2400 is OK but it's hard to
 beat 9600 and y/zmodem for up-downloading.  For large files on CIS I use
 14400 and their 'B' protocol.  For 14400 on CIS, use 1-800-544-3095 -
 there is a hefty surcharge.

 This is not an OSK problem but rather, a problem with the driver written
 by the OEM.  In fact, you don't need CD to hang up.  Most modems can be
 forced to disconnect by the settings of &D and &Q.  If CD isn't supported
 by the driver, the _ss_dcoff() and _ss_dcon() functions are useless.  And,
 there are other ways to handle the information.

 GRIN!

 I understand the more recent machines from Hazelwood/FHL (the TC-70 and
 the KIX) still come with 2.3;  2.4 'is a-coming' <g>.

 Version 2.4 still comes with the K&R Compiler from most OEMs.  However,
 most also offer ULTRA C (the ansi compiler) as an option.  We, (DELMAR CO)
 offer ULTRA C to our customers at a very low price.  The regular price is
 $1295.00, the same as MW's price.  BTW, according to MW's docs, you must
 have version 2.4 of OSK to use ULTRA C.

 Re GNU C - I'm not sure 2.5 Megs is enough memory for it and I think (might
 be wrong) it requires version 2.4 of OSK.  Might check with one the GNU gurus
 here or on CIS.

 I assume you're referring to the file manager listing at the end of the
 book, the answer is yes - several people have.  Changes were made to his
 code and the driver was modified but the end result worked.  Peter's
 listing 'leans' towards GMX's drivers.  It 'kinda' assumes using a 37c65
 chip.  I suppose it could be modified to handle the 1772 driver/chip
 but this would be quite a chore and you could not use high density disks.

Just tried it here using 'screen' on a standard 80x26 MM/1 'vsc' type 0
window, and it worked OK.  Guess we'll need to narrow things down a little
bit.  My version of screen says that it's edition 7, CRC $F76802.  I don't
remember if this is the original one from the database here, or if is one
of Bob van der Poel's updates.  Hmmm... the date on it is 92/03/30, so
it must be the original.

'Screen' builds its own TERMCAP environment variable, which is a combination
of its ANSI emulator, plus characteristics from the original device (e.g.,
number of lines and columns).  Following are some of the relevant entries

Yes, you are the second person to comment on this.  When I ported 'ispell',
I tried to make it a bit clearer to the user what would happen to the
changes entered during the session.  I guess that I didn't completely
succeed.

If you type 'x' to 'eXit', you receive the following prompt:
   Exit, ABANDONING changes:  <y/n>?
Responding 'y' will terminate the program, and abandon the changes.
Responding 'n' indicates that you do not want to Exit, and returns back
to spellchecking mode.

Similarly, if you type 'q' to 'Quit', you receive this prompt:
   Quit, saving changes:  <y/n>?
Responding 'y' will terminate the program after saving the changes.
Responding 'n' indicates that you do not want to Quit, and returns back
to spellchecking mode.  It was not intended to mean "Quit without saving
the changes" -- that is what "eXit" does.

Sorry if you found this confusing.  I think the '?' help screen provides
a bit of a clarification, but I can understand how you could mis-interpret
the second prompt.

Question, I just saw a new peogram called GNG in the database. I read what it
said in the description and it said it would run under os9. Will it work on
my coco3 with 512k? Thanks
Bob

This submission if compiled for OS-9/68K... While source is includes, the
OS-K binaries look pretty big, so it would probably be too big to port
to the coco, unless, the porter stripped out some of the features...

     Sacia help
     From: TOMFANN      To: ALL

I downloaded Bruce Isted's "Replacement for ACIAPAK" (SACIA) and after
dearcing it, I have 3 sacia files.  They are sacia.man, sacia.dr, and
sacia.mpi.  What are these, and which one goes in my bootfile?  I figure
the ".dr" must mean "driver", but I can't figure out what the others are.
I want to use this with Supercomm and a stock Tandy Deluxe RS-232 Pak.

Any help will be appreciated.

..Tom Fann

SAcia.man is the documentation (manual page) file.
SAcia.dr is the driver to use, if you are using a Y-Cable, or a "strapped" MPI.
Sacia.mpi is another version of the driver that you use if you are using
a "stock" MPI, with the RS-232 in slot 1, and disk controller in slot4.

If you list out the Sacia.man file, and read it, it will tell you more in
more detail.
