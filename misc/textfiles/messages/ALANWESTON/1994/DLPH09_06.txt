     nothing much!!
     From: SAUSAGESAM   To: ALL

Hello all out there!! I just bought a 28.8k modem today for about $170.
It's really neat.. Has Caller ID built in and every protocol there is and
lots of other stuff. Anyway, I know I can't use this modem to it's
potential, but I bought it for the future so when my Mom gets an IBM compat
in a couple of months I can download stuff at 3500 cps or so! (No I'm not
going to give up the CoCo. I LOVE IT way to much. It's my FRIEND!!).
Anyway, I have two things to say... One is something really interesting. I
thought 19.2k was the fasted port speed you could pick in Ultimaterm. Well,
I went one up and there was a "450 baud". I thought, well I'll try this and
see what happens... And you know WHAT??! It MADE my port 115,200 BAUD!!!
of course my coco cant receive data that fast. When I log into a BBS I get

CARRIER 28800
PROT: LAP-M
CONNECT 115200

It really suprised me!!  But when I am on a BBS, if I watch the modem and my
computer screen, I see the modem's receive data light go off and on real fast,
but Ultimaterm is still putting stuff on the screen from where the modem fills
up it's buffer. It's cool though. It would be great if the guy who wrote
Ultimaterm could rewrite it for 6309 Code to get it going faster! I would
definatly buy it!

Okay, now to my other thing I was gonna say. If anybody wants to make me a
deal on my old (one month old) U.S. Robotics 14.4k modem, let me know! I
have the box and all the instruction booklets and everything that came with
it, including that stupid free software that you have to run on an IBM to
try online services. Using Ultimaterm I could always get around 1200 CPS
on transfers...   If anyone wants my modem leave me an offer! It has a 5
year warranty so if anything goes wrong with it you can send it back to me
and I'll send it in for repair...

l8r all!

Which rs232 pak do you have?  My CoNect 6551A port does not work with that
"450" speed on Uterm.  It is interesting to note that the "450" speed is
after 19.2 and before the low speeds (50, 75, 150, 300).  If it were
actual "450 bps" it would have been located after the 300 and before
the 600 bps.  So this rate could be an undocumented 115,200 that the
author of Uterm was playing with, it was mis-labeled as 450.

Some UART chips "for the CoCo" may have a setting higher than 19,200
but the 6551A in my CoNect port does not support it.

Welps, I'm using a modified modem pak so I have no idea what UART is in it.
I really don't even know what a UART is...! hehe.  Do you have a 28.8k
modem? 14.4k's only support a throughput (or whatever) of 56,200 or
somethin'... so if you had a 14.4k or less then commands won't work. But
with this 28.8k I bought, the throughput goes up to 230,400 bps or
something.. so I'm able to select that bps rate "450"..

By the way, don't ask *why* I got a 28.8k modem!! Well, it was just at a
real good price and I couldn't resist. But now when an IBM moves into the
house I can share this modem with it as well as my coco.. right now it's
using the v.fc protocol but you can buy a eprom to replace the one inside
to make it v.34/v.fc...

ttyl!

I only have a 14.4 modem, it took me a long time to even afford this one,
much less a modem that cost twice what I paid for this.   I just wish
I could get better performance from OS-9 based term programs, 4800 is
better than 2400 but I would love to run at 9600 without errors or
even 19.2 (14.4).

I'm almost tempted to try to get my hard drive working under RS-DOS...
but I would miss the multi-tasking environment!

I paid $130 for mine through DaMark.  They offered an payment plan of
4 payments.  I could have bought a modem cheaper through other sources
but not with a payment plan.

Thanks for the info, Tony. Since I just added a CDROM I better say no, at
least until Xmas time. To clear my head though, does the device plug into
a MSDOS box or the MM1?

I tried from my office which has access to the internet through MORENET,
the latter being the Missouri Educational network. I did use anonymous
as user name and various passwords though not my delphi address. I'll

Hmm.. Strange... case shopuld only matter in the username... the password is

Can you capture an attempted ftp session that fails to a text file

Happy to report that I have successfully reached Chestnut and ftp a few
files. The only thing that I know I did differently is that I used
my dephi address as password rather than my office address. Wouldnt
think that would matter, but there is the fact that our campus network
was just coming up when I tried getting to Chestnut the first time, and
then there were some tornadoes up there in Wisconsin! Anyway, thanks
for the help!

I notice that on all of your messages, most of the "9" characters seem
to be missing.  Is this a problem with your keyboard, uploading software,
or what???

It is very disconcerting reading through your messages when they are
missing these "9"s.  For example, the above line should probably have been:
 "> RE> OS9 users group & OS9UG"

Read through any of the messages that you have left over the past month

  Foro purposes here,, I7m shure most equate referance to OS.  Though
 it may be 9 or K.
  Though the term OS-9 in the public media is generic to OS K or 9,,
 where as here or among CoCoists,, there is a difference.
 i.e. OS-9 runs on a CoCo OSK does not.
  An opinion,,, unwlecome I'm shure (but does that stop me?),,, since the OS9UG
is admittedly looking more oto OSK,, for cleaiet
 one would think it would be appropiately named the USKUG.

Terry, there is no such animal as OSK... It is a slang term to describe OS-9
for the Motorola 68000 Family of processors. There is OS-9/68000 and OS-9/6809
(which is no longer sold/supported by Microware) OS-9 by itself refers to
the collective varients of OS-9 for different platforms/architectures.

The OS-9 Users Group, Inc supports OS-9, OS-9/6809, and OS-9000 EQUALLY.
The ammount of individual support any one sub interest gets is dependant
on what they put into the group. If users for any perticular interest
don't join the group, then support for that interest will drop, because the
users are not there to make that interest supported. If there is, say
twice as many OS-9/6809 users in the group then OS-9/68000 users, then it
would be safe to say that OS-9/6809 will get twice the support, because, the
USERS in the groups are where the support comes from. The Officers are just
there for the Users (members) to channel their interests through, and to
govern the actions of the group as a whole.

A short analogy...  The way I see OS-9...

  Let us say, for the moment, that OS-9 is ICE CREAM.  Ice cream is ice cream
but with various flavors.  There is chocolate ICE CREAM, vanilla ICE CREAM,
neopolitan ICE CREAM...
  Now, look at OS-9...  There is OS-9 L1, OS-9 L2, OS-9/68K, OS-9000...  All

Possiby.  The more variety the better, although this would probably be
a pretty big undertaking to write a new complete compiler.

Ummm... I don't have RUNB on my system (System 5), or at least it was not
installed on the disk.  This is the first I'd heard about runb coming with
Prof. OSK.  Would be nice.

and it is not mentioned.  I had never heard anywhere that it was included.

I love it.  I'm really impressed.  Yes, I have G-Windows.  I haven't
scratched the surface of its capabilities.  I keep discovering more and
more about it all the time.  The only thing that I might have reservations
about is the text scrolling.  It's a LITTLE slower than I would like, but
it's operating in 800x600 mode, a lot of pixels.  It may be a little hard
to get screen capturing of data from a modem at 38.4 K (but in the text
screen -  no prob).  I grabbed a file from a local BBS using TIMKIENTZLE's
xy using Ymodem-G.  I didn't time it myself, but the BBS reportd over
1600 CPS (and this was a ZIPped file, where compression didn't help much).

Graphics are fantastic.  Have several GIF's that are unreal.  Also have
a FLIC animation viewer.  I know these don't give much toward productivity,
but we all gotta play a little <G>.  RE: the graphics modes under G-W, it
CAN go to 1024 x 768. The text is really sharp, but TINEEEY!!!

I believe that anyone would be happy with any of the systems available, but
I have no regrets whatsoever about my system

RE: GWindows...

One more thing I was gonna say about G-W.. after 7 or 8 years using the
CoCo's windowing system, it DOES take a little getting adjusted to the
G-Windows system.  No doubt it is better, but as I said, after years of
hitting the <CLEAR> key, it's hard to break old habits <G>

No, this call was not implemented....  I never did pursue it much further,
I did add a thing or 2, but never passed it on.. been a long time..

Yeah, I can get your meaning about learning.. That's the best way to learn.

        >>but at $600 per copy and no 68020..<<

        Yeah that is a bit limiting, but on the other hand if it's
   possible to  get some good cheap Amiga 500's(they are 68000 or 070
   aren't they?), it may be reasonable to sell a complete hardware
   Amiga/Os9 package as intro developement systems. Given my lack of
   Amiga knowledge I don't know how doable that would be, but given the
   assumption that you could do such a thing and price it somewhere in
   the $1000 range, you might have something that would go over well at
   shows. It still sounds like that will need fine tuning.
        The advantage to this over getting a pt68k machine is, the amiga
   already has software available, making Os-9 ports,rewrites a virtual
   reality :-) Maybe having Kwindows available with it would be a good
   benefit, but I'm daydreaming.....:-)

The only info I've been able to find easily on the A500 as far as price
goes is that a refurbished motherboard is around $200 with 512K. So I don't
think they will be found at such a price to make a $1000 or so system feasible.
Even so, you'd only have a single floppy system, whereas the PT68K would at
least have a 20MB hard drive (or larger) for the same price. So which would
you want? And bear in mind that the Amiga is using a 640x200 monitor (640x
400 with interlacing), so can't be used with G-windows. And there is supposed
to be a version of K-Windows in the works for the Atari and PT series...
Atari version (ST) is available for 99.95 English pounds (somewhere between
$150-$200) including delivery to the US. Cumana just says that support is
limited.

        Depends. If the software environment for the Amiga is good enough
   it might be a good idea to go that route(if not both), even tho you
   might have to pay a little more for the same hardware you'll get with
   a PT68K. If Kwindows actually is going to come to the PT68K( and the
   ATARI??? News to me!), I would probably rather go PT68k. I'm still
   personally not to big on the pre-$1000 systems since you can get you
   could get a pretty complete MM/1 at this time for $975. This is
   Blackhawks limited time deal for the first 50 or so machines, but even
   when this is over, the regular price is only $1125(I'm reading this
   out of his add in your magazine btw ;-) ). If you add a harddrive your
   probably talking an extra $200-$300  at the most. So if you already
   have a CM-8(and want to stick with it for the MM/1) that means your
   final cost will most likely be less than $1400 and if the drive isn't
   that huge probably under $1300. Hardly too much for a computer system.
        Keep in mind, I'm not saying the low cost system idea doesn't
   have merit. If it can bring in some more OSK programmers that we
   couldn't get otherwise, I won't complain. I just find it odd that
   machines like the MM/1 and the System IV both are now competitively
   priced against PC's(tell me someone isn't losing money here), and
   there are still people out there who want to go OSK, but refuse to get
   one of these systems because they are priced 'too high'. Keep in mind,
   some of these are the same people who about a month later get a PC
   with the money the 'don't have' for an OSK box. I'm the type who loses
   patience with these types right about this point. If the point of the
   'Under $1000' systems is to bring in new blood from outside of the
   current OS-9 Community( best bet being in other Hacker communities
   besides our own), it isn't a bad idea at all and I like it myself. If
   it's in response to unreasonable demands of people who (and I'm not
   picking on the whole Coco community. There are lots of exceptions),
   think these new (and not so new) systems should be available at a
   (used) Coco price, I wouldn't waste my time(nothing will make them
   happy). Such time is better spent laughing at 'em <grin>.

 Chris,

 You can purchase a SYSTEM IV computer for just under $1000.  This is a
 complete and fully operational 68000 16 MHz system with Professional OS-9,
 version 2.4.  As your budget permits, for only a few hundred dollars, you
 can add a hard drive and gfx later.  Also, Ultra-C is available for only
 $300 if purchased at the same time.

There is no real development environment with the Amiga version... just
"vanilla" OSK. It is difficult to build a cheap OSK system yourself at much
of a lower cost than buying one from BlackHawk or Delmar. You save just a
couple/three hundred building it yourself, so unless you are doing it for the
pleasure of building yourself, in my mind it probably isn't worth it (hackers
at heart only!) just for the savings. OSK for the PT68K series (v. 2.4) is only
$300. If you have a lot of Amiga hardware already, then it may be worth the
price to not have a second computer lying around.

Most people justify the price of a PC because they can find the software they
need to do a specific job. Get something similar to and as easy to use and
powerful as PageMaker 4.0 on the OSK machines and I will probably consider
buying one myself. At the present time, I don't see one in the near future,
not unless I start getting a LOT more subscribers than I have now (around
300, +/-20 or so, seems to be the saturation point). If I could keep an average
of 500 +/- 20 subscribers, I could justify at least one OSK machine just to
do reviews and such on. As it is, I'm running my CoCo, and using it to keep
the financial records (Dynacalc) and saubscriber database (Bob van der Poel's
mailing list program) under OS-9. PageMaker on my 486/50 produces the
mag itself (PM 4.01 on a Mac produces OS-9 Underground, by the way).
Things like TeX COULD be used, but aren't easy enough to use for this type
work (producing a magazine). I recently acquired PM 5.0, and will be getting
a laser printer soon.

About KWindows.. I, as an owner of a Delmar system, would like to see
KWindows available, to be able to run some of the s/w specific for K-W,
but you gotta see G-Windows.  I'm extremely impressed.

Well, to tell the truth, have you ever stopped to count up what you have
invested in your CoCo?  Sure, you (and I) probably spent it a little at
a time, but my 512K HD/floppy/RBG based CoCo bought new  totalled over
$1500 (quickly figuring).  As I said, I didn't spend it all at one time,
but, by the same token, you can piecemeal build your OSK system, too.
With either system (MM/1, Delmar, or FHL), if you want, you can get the
case/contents and then hook your CoCo or other system to it and get
stuff done.  You then have the building block to go ahead, and as money
permits, add your video and keyboard.  With the Terminal setup, of course
you cannot use the advanced graphics of the systems (K-Windows or G-Windows),
but you can at least start getting the software you need and it will work.
I think a lot of the peoples' biggest hangup is the commitment.

     OS-9 Late Night(Whatta night!)
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

                       ***OS-9 Late Night:Open Topic***

        Well last nights conference came and went, and BOY did it come!
   To sum it up with 1 word:SUCCESS The place was packed since 10 past 10
   and went on full throttle until past 12:00 am! We didn't close up
   shop until about a little after 1:00. As advertised, it was a very
   open topic conference and as a matter of fact, we spent very little
   time on any one topic. There was just too much energy and too much we
   all had on our minds relating to the Coco community. What this tells
   me is, this conference has been LOOOOOONG overdue, and when used in
   conjunction with this forum and other media either offline/online that
   we have at our disposal, we could have a very powerful tool for
   generating activity within the community. I found that I am not the
   only one who has a lot of ideas that would be nice to have carried,
   and that actually many people shared the same ideas I have. Pooling
   our ideas together and ACTING on them will make a big difference in
   our future, and as we found out last night, there is no shortage of
   them!
        While it may take a couple days for me to get the transcript
   online I'll post here some of the highlights of last night. Since it
   was basically a free for all from beginning to end, things were quite
   messy and hard to keep up with, as many different things were
   happening at once(as attendees will probably agree with). I will take
   a little while to clean up that huge file, and will omit things that
   are of little importance. Anyway here are some highlights:

        Brother Jeremy brought up that we should embark on a project too
   port/rewrite some of the better DECB apps(with permission) to OS-9
   using his Max-10 project as an example. I agree and am behind him and
   everyone else who would like to organize such a thing. I was
   commenting that maybe they could write up a plan of attack and who to
   contact for permission for their programs and then get a group of us
   together to do the porting-rewriting. We could then dedicate the end
   of each weeks conference, or better yet set up a seperate sub
   conference on this project, in order to get together and update
   eachother. Personally I won't be able to do such a thing myself
   anytime soon, or I'll just be spreading myself too thin with the
   programming and projects I am currently involved in. I would love to
   jump into such a thing when I get free time tho. I see this as a sort
   of long term, slowly-but-surely project which could be run at the
   convenience of the participants, not really something needed at this
   second. Anyhow, IF someone  decides to take on such a project, I hope
   it works out. We all need the software.

        Alan Dekok and Colin McKay made a somewhat surprise appearance
   last night and announced 'Tune Up' from their Northern Exposure
   company. This is actually Alans project which he was motivated to do,
   by recent messages to him on the Cocolist from people who wanted to
   see a Nitros9 type package for 6809 stock OS-9 Level II. What this
   will be when he finishes it will be a bunch of patches to stock OS-9
   modules so they will run a decent rate faster than they do now, but
   keep in mind, it is no NITROS9. This is simply for people who don't
   want to or can't go to a 6309 Nitros9. This will give them a decent
   speed increase, but it will not be comparable to Nitros9. Alan will be
   back in about two to three weeks to announce the release of the new
   NITROS9 Package and Tune Up and to answer any questions. Hopefully
   Colin and perhaps some other on the Northern Exposure team will be
   back with him!  I found out last night that these guys sure keep
   themselves busy! Thanks to Ken Scales for letting them use his
   account. While I just got off the phone with Alan maybe a couple hours
   before the conference started, I wasn't expecting him and Colin to
   show. They sure made a great conference even better! I can't to hear
   what they have in the works for Northern Exposure in a couple weeks.

        Alan mentioned the new update to shell+(v2.2 I think) that Curtis
   Boyle did. I guess it has already been out for a bit, but this was the
   first I heard of it. Was there any mention of it here in forum?

        We later on discussed bootdisks as planned, and talked about the
   ability to use a 3 1/2" as bootdisk /d0 and the many ways to go about
   doing it. I don't really need this myself but will probably toy around
   with such a project sometime just to get my hands dirty on such a
   project<shouldn't be THAT hard>.

        The next 'OS-9 Live!' will be held on Saturday September 17
   hosted by Boisy Pitre as usual, and Joel Hegberg will be in attendance
   also. The subject is going to be 'The Future of Personal OS-9'. As
   usual, I plan on being here for this one, unless something comes up.
   September seems to be a great month shaping up for conferences. Let's
   see, Northern Exposure will be there, ACS may be represented at the
   Atlanta fest conference, the next OS-9 Live will probably be the
   biggest conference of the year, given the subject. Plus with the
   Programming Discussion for our next conference to start us off this
   coming  Monday, we are looking  perty darn good. Hopefully another
   Town Meeting will be held by the OS-9 Users Group sometime in the
   course of the month.

        With a little coaxing on the part of Jim Vestal and Mike Owen,
   OS-9 Late Night is going WEEKLY! I guess you guys really twisted my
   arm ;-) Jim has offered to host some of the nights where I might not
   be able to make so things will work out rather nicely. There really is
   just so much material and events that we would have to do a lot of
   squeazing within the biweekly schedual, and a lot of stuff still won't
   be covered. Plus even if I don't have a dedicated topic, we do want to
   get a lot of open topic nights like we had last night just so people
   can have a conference to go to for general Coco/OS-9 Chat and such.

        Jim also mentioned an idea of getting a C++ library ported to OS-
   9. Sounds like an interesting idea, but since I know nada on C++
   there's not much I can add to this. If you get any ideas, maybe you
   could leave him some in forum(I'd be interested in following the
   topic). Correction, it is Turbo C, not C++ he was talking about.

        Frank, editor of The World of 68 Micros Magazine agreed having a
   conference on said magazine(and I propose we have another conference
   on Farna Systems or have one conference covering both). Jim, assistant
   editor of 'The International OS-9 Underground' also brought up the
   possibility of a conference for the zine he works with. Look for both
   of these sometime in the near future, as both are likely. Of course, I
   propose we hold them both on the same night so we can watch a grudge
   match between the competition but ...(so much for my imagination) (Big
   Grin)

        Well, there was a lot more talked about, but you'll see that in
   the transcript, once I get it cleaned up. What have I learned from
   this first conference? Well, we definately need to communicate our
   ideas MUCH more and start ACTING on them. With the backing of the UG
   and a number of different publications at our disposal(something we
   really didn't have to our advantage in the Rainbow era), there is no
   reason we can't make OS-9 and it's community shine. I eagerly  await
   some of the conferences coming up with those that are VERY ACTIVE in
   the community to see what they have to say! Also, there is so much out
   there we don't know about, that we do need our vendors to promote more
   often. Hopefully this conference can fill some gaps. For instance some
   people don't even know there are Magazines still out there, or that
   the Ken-Ton Harddrive system is still available through Farna Systems,
   or that Rick's Computer Enterprises now carries the Sundog Game
   Catalog,etc...You get my point. One of the reasons people think
   nothing exists for the Coco or OS-9 is because they don't know where
   to find it, or who to go to. I'm starting to appreciate the new OS-9
   Source Book idea even better now.

        Well, that wraps this message up. Come again next Monday Night at
   10:00 as Jim and myself hold a discussion on programming for OS-9
   level II. Also, keep an eye out for my Conference schedual I will soon
   be posting. It will list all the conferences planned thus far for the
   month of September.

        See Ya

     You should definitely drop in on the conferences. If you come in late
it can be confusing, but if you stay with it, it will start to make sense.
One of the reasons it was confused is that multiple conversations take
place, especially when the topic is completely open. When a topic is fixed,
the moderator usually let's the scheduled expert explain the topic and then
it is opened up for questions. If you have any questions while you're in a
conference, by all means jump there. That's the best way to get aquainted.
You shoulod probably download the transcript of the conference too. That might
help you sort out what was talked about. If you have more questions, drop
either Chris or myself a note or post it in the forum. These conferences
are really worth while, especially for people like me who are just
learning. I don't know the limit for a conference either. I'll be interested
to see the answer myself.

Hope to see you again in conference :)

I'm writing a TURBO C cross-library for OS-9 Level 2 windows.  This
will allow Turbo "conio.h" functions to compile under OS-9 C and run
properly on a Level 2 window.  It can easily be ported to OS-9 K-windows
too.

It was mentioned that I would love to see a C++ compiler (or filter
similar to ANSIFRONT) for the Microware C.  I love how ANSIFRONT performs.

        Yeah it did get pretty twisted<grin>. I'm STILL editing the
   logfile! It's HUGE(had to vsplit it). I liked it tho. It showed there
   was still plenty of interest in getting together and accomplishing
   things. The moderated conferences will be much easier to follow as you
   basically have the guest host(speaker) start things off, and then the
   rest will be a q+a session. It will follow a format so things don't go
   wild. Open topic conferences will be a chance to just go wild I guess
   :-) It's a good time to bring them nagging questions.

        >>Gee, how many can you fit into a Delphi conference room?<<

        There's no set number as I understand it. It all depends on how
   the rest of Delphi is populated. It is like OS-9. There is no set
   limit to how many windows you can have open, assuming the memory is
   there. If there is a lot of activity elsewhere(as there usually is at
   night) it is going to limit the amount we can have before we start
   slowing down. I remember hearing about a conference,in I THINK it was
   the Atari Sig. They had about 30+ people there and came pretty close
   to shutting down the whole system(I don't think anyone could even log
   in for the rest of the night). This system,as much as I love it, needs
   work.

Right.  You develop a real dependence on it.  I can only kick myself for
waiting around to order and now I may have to wait till Bill gets his
supply system set back up.. Like you, I'd hate to do without it.

Not sure that it saves you money, it seems that I just do more modeming <G>

a msg that you can upload in 10 seconds would take 3-5 minutes (or more)

still seem to put out jibberish at times even with offline composition <G>..

     LII SETSST/GETSTT Codes
     From: VAXELF       To: ALL

  I am port some basic09 routines over to OSK Basic. These have SYSCALL
calls in them. Most of the syscall codes, I have figured out. Here is what I
have need:

    SYSCALL Callcode - $15     What is it?

    GetSst/SetSst codes

                $1F
                $17
                $18
                $19
                $91
                $98

  Also what is the OSK version of:

           F$NMLink
           F$NMLoad

     As for the GetSst/SetSst codes, I think $91 is READ PALLETE, but not
sure. $17 & $18 in the OSK Manual is SS_WFM & SS_RFM. According to the
Basic09 code $17 is SET TO BINARY and $18 is SET TO ASCII.

     Also could someone post the calling parameters for SS_Size under LII.
I think LII splits the results into the x & u registers, where the OSK
version is all in one resgister d2.l . I think I do away with the code that
either splits the value into reg.lx & reg.lu or combines the two, since
the OSK version is already a long reg.

  Thanks in advance.

John,

  Sys code $15 is F$Time.

 For F$NM*, use the correct link/load call. No need for the "no map" versions
with OSK (being a flat map).

 Correct on the SS.Size stuff. X is the high 16 bits, U is the low. Trash it all

and use the single 32 bit D2.

John,

 Get/Setstat calls are not unique. The same number can mean different things
to different drivers/managers. I think it's safe to assume the $91 and $98 are
being written to a cc3io device (screen) and are SS.Palet and SS.Tone. The
other three are a little harder. $17, $18, and $19 show up in my lists as tape
drive (SBF) calls. I don't think this fits with your project.
Are you sure these are getstat calls? If so, what device is the path
opened to (reg A)?

  Thanks for the response. Looking at the basic09 program, I noticed
it has a comment line before the $17 & $18 SetSst calls

    $17   "Set to Ascii
    $18   "Set to Binary"

There were no comments for $19 & $1F.

According to my OSK Manual, $17 & $18 ar Tape Commands.

Having another problem too. These basic09 routines call some 6809
assembly code routines. I used "xlate" to translate them to 68000 and
have them compiled. I think the front end where the assembly code gets
the varibles passed by basic may be the problem. If I sent you a file
with the basic delcarations, call sequence, and source of assembly
routine, could you take a look and see what the problem is???

  I am attempting to port the RIBBS BBS software over to OSK. A good
FIDO compatable BBS is one of the things missing for OSK. Once the
RIBBS BBS is ported over to the MM/1, then the plan is to make a version
that does not rely on MM/1 KWindow commands, so OSK_RIBBS can run on
any OSK system. After that, the plan is to rewrite the BBS into C and
go from there.
  It looks like I have most of it working, except those few GetSst/SetSst
calls and the assembly routines.
  All of the assembly routines front end code is almost identical. It
only varies as to how many varibles are passed. I feel once the first
routine is working, then it will be only a matter making the same modes
to the other assembly routines, recompile, and go for it.
  I think we are real close now at having a beta version of RIBBS for OSK.

  Anyone else that reads this message is welcome to help out with this
problem too.

results of xlate.

  I think I have found at least one of the problems. I created a simple
Basic program that setup a TYPE array and a STRING. These are sent to
a assembly routine that reads the array varibles, the string, then sends
the string to I$Write to be printed on the terminal. First problem is my
basic program generates a 043 Error when it tries to access the sample
assembly code routine. I tried both putting the assembly routine in
DD/CMDS and loading it inot memory. Either way it failed to find it.
The MW Basic manual does not give what the stack parameters are for a
assembly routine to find the data passed to it.
  I can send you the sample assembly routine and both the sample assembly
source and binary. The assembly routine front end is identical to the
translated 6809 to 68000 routines. The comments contain the 6809 code.
  I need to figure out why the routines are not being found by Basic,
they may work, if basic can access them.
  In the back of the Basic book is a source listing of SYSCALL. I did
notice it uses a

    org     0

statement. may try that in the sample code.

   I'll send the testasm.b and the asmtest.a for you look at and test.

  I see, btw I found one of my problems. Looking closer at the SYSCALL
source listing in the Basic Manual, the psect line uses different varibles
than is used for stand alone programs. I recoded the asmtest.a with the
changes and now basic can find it, but I still get errors.

Edition  equ   0
Typ_lang equ   (Sbrtn<<8)!Objct
AttrRev  equ   ((ReEnt)<<8)!1
Stack    equ   0

Also noticed that D0 will have the number of varibles passed to the M/L.

This is as far as I can get. What I need is the complete stack layout of
what is on which register and ect.
  I have a copy of the old Basic09 Tour Guide and it shows the registers
for 6809 M/L that is passed from basic.
  I suppect that if someone took "Cstart.a" from C, they could come up
with a "Bstart.a", that would allow you to use C to make M/L routines for
Basic.
  If your interested in being a RIBBS_OSK Beta tester, let me know.

One thing you might check for:  Basic generates this error if you try
to access a module (map it into the address space) and there is not an
8K block to map it into.  If you have PMap, check out your address space.
If so can you merge it with another module/group of modules?

Found the fix. It seems M/L modules's psec header must contain certain
info or Basic will not reconize it as a subroutine. Page A-19 of the MW
Basic Manual for OSK, has the source code for OSK version of SYSCALL.
In it was the correct code for the header. A couple of other users have
since told me how the data is passed.
  Thanks for the reply. This project now has a light at the end of the

The coco 3 still works "some of the time".  This I remind you is an
intermittant problem and that is why it is so hard to troubleshoot.
Rather than mess with it anymore, I just replaced it.  Before I switched
coco's, I did install a brand new 6809 in the socket to see if the 6309
was blown, but no change.  And the problem is amplified by having the MPI
plugged in with the SCII in slot 4.  The toughest part of this whole mess
is the way some hardware set ups would work while others wouldn't, and
some would some of the time.  The #$%$ with it, I just replaced the coco
and MPI and all is fine now.  I will install the 6309 next week when I
get a gold plated 40 pin socket.  After I have that working, then I  will
reinstall my 2 meg upgrade.

Hi Ken,

  Message received and understood...  Now for a question that has been
nagging me for a couple of years now...

  Why is it that I am seeing software written machine specific, ie: for MM/1?
Are not all the 68XXX processors backward compatible such as the unINTELagent
X86 chips?  If software cannot be made to run on ALL 68XXX machines, with
something like an environment file to tell it what chip is used, I see no way
for OS-9 (in whatever form it is in) to become competative with MS-DOS or
WINDOWS.  Is there, also, an OS-9 that runs on an MM/1 and another that runs
on say a Delmar machine?
  I just baught a motherboard that will accept up to a 486 DX2/50Mhz chip for
which I plan on running OS-9000 on some day when it becomes more personally
affordable.  At this time, it is too expensive for personal use.  In the mean
time, I will be running DR-DOS V6.0, not messy-dog.  Gotta go, see ya.

The problem isn;t CPU compatibility, it's "enhancements" compatibility
that's the problem.  So, stuff written for K-windows won't work
with G-windows.  I for one would like to see ONE standard windowing

A detailed answer to your questions could be quite lengthy, but I will try
to provide the major points here.

 > Why is it that I am seeing software written machine specific, ie: for
 > MM/1?

Mostly because the MM/1 comes equipped with a configuration that includes
colour graphics, sound, etc., BUT these can ONLY be accessed using
system software (K-Windows) that is not available on the other machines.

The other systems can also be configured for colour graphics and sound.
But, rather than having K-Windows, they generally have an alternate
(optional; purchased separately) windowing system, G-Windows.

The two windowing systems are not compatible.

The MM/1 users like K-Windows, because it came with their systems, is
very similar to CoCo Level 2 windows, and includes a basic development
library for them to hack with.  They do not tend to like G-Windows because
it costs extra, the development package is sold separately, and it pushes
the MM/1 hardware to the extreme of its limits (especially display
resolution).

Owners of the Delmar/PT/CDS and FHL systems like G-Windows because it
is available for their machines, and is a sophisticated, powerful
environment quite similar to X-Windows, and includes a desktop GUI.
They do not like K-Windows because it is not available for their machines
yet, and will cost extra when it becomes available anyways.

This is currently the major source for system-specific versions of
software being developed.  It is hurting us all, IMHO.

At the application level, the 68XXX family is quite backward compatible.
Most differences tend to be at the Supervisor (operating system) level,
so a 68020 system uses a slightly different OS-9 kernel and drivers.
To the user and application writer, this should be transparent (if
the application writer compiles for the 68000 target, avoiding special
features of the more powerful processors, similar to avoiding '486
specific features if you want the application to run on a '286).

Generally, software can be written that does not use any of the special
system calls provided by either K-Windows or G-Windows, and is portable
amongst all of the systems.  Some examples are the Ved editor, Sculptor
database manager, Ispell spellchecker, Rogue and Moria games, SC
spreadsheet, etc.  But this tends to mean no graphics, no mouse, etc. (an
exception being limited mouse support in Ved).  The "environment file"
is normally "termcap".  It does not describe the "chip", but rather the
way that the particular terminal on the system can be controlled.

 > Is there, also, an OS-9 that runs on

There are special _drivers_ to communicate with the particular machine's
hardware, but both of these systems use OS-9 V2.4.  This is equivalent
to some PCs having IDE drives, others SCSI, etc. -- different drivers at
the operating system level to support the particular hardware platform,
but this should be transparent to the user and applications, once the
system is configured.

Why don't you like the "lowest common denominator text screen based stuff"?

I see nothing wrong with writing text screen programs, using things such

     From: EDELMAR      To: 01GEN40 (NR)


 Ken Scales has done a pretty good job of explaining what is happening in
 message 89743.  To add a few points -

 The MW C Compiler permits the programmer to program for either the 68000
 or the 68020.  Similarly, there are 2 assemblers; one for the 68000 and
 the second for the 68020.  The only time (most) programmers use the 68020
 mode is when they are writing code dedicated to an 020 or higher chip -
 mostly the industrial market and require the performance.  Almost all GP
 programs are compiled for the 68000 and will run on any OS-9/68xx0 machine.

 The problems you are alluding to deal with graphics.  Graphics are a function
 of the gfx chip set selected by the OEM and have nothing to do with OS-9
 or the cpu.  The designers of the MM/1 selected the VSC (forget the chip
 number) for their gfx.  This chip in conjunction with the 68070 cpu provides
 a low-cost, gfx solution.

 DELMAR CO and Periphiral Technology decided to use a 'standard' pc compatible
 gfx board for GFX - specifically gfx boards using the TSENG LABS ET4000/
 ET4000w32i gfx chips.  (I won't get into the reasons.)

 Other OEM's are using other chip sets although several are also using the
 TSENG LABS chips.  For example, GESPAC is using boards based on the HITACHI
 gfx chips.  Note that G-WINDOWS runs on a variety of platforms and software
 written for G-WINDOWS will (to the best of my knowledge) run on all of these
 platforms.

 In retrospect, had we (all the OEM's) stuck to RAVE, many of the graphics
 incompatibility problems wouldn't exist.  But, hardware and software cost
 to the end user would be higher.

 Re your comments about the 80x86 being backward compatible.  Yes, they are.
 But the software isn't.  Up to a few years ago, software written for MSDOS
 was mostly compatible with the Intel family.  However, when MS introduced
 Windows 3.1, full backward compatibility ceased; at least an 80286 cpu is
 required.  Almost all software released today requires Windows 3.1. hence
 will not run with a 8086 cpu.  Further, if you examine the driver disk(s)
 you received with your VGA card, you will see the mfg provided his own
 drivers - you cannot change to another gfx card without installing new
 drivers.  In fact, some software houses find the drivers provided inadequate
 and provide their own.  For example, look at the later AutoCad distributions.

 Re OS-9000 - You can obtain a 'PC/AT Run-Time Package' for $595.  This is
 a subset of the PC/AT Development Package - does not include any application
 development tools.  As to the price dropping, IMHO, I doubt very much this
 will occur in the foreseeable future unless MW repeats the special they
 offered last year.  I don't perceive MW attempting to attract the personal
 user ala IBM, MS, etc.

Well, I tend to agree with MRGOOD's sentiment.  I can live with the "lcd
text apps, but as he stated in his reply, I, too, would hate to think I'd
be stuck with the wonderful windowing system I have, or likewise for the
other systems, too, and not be able to use them.  I'd like to see maybe
an interface implemented whereby if you wanted to create an overlay
window, for example, the task could be handed out to it and let it handle
the specifics. It would  seem that it could be handled a little like
"gfx2".

Ken, you really did a great job explaining the reasons for system-
specific software.  I would like to add to one point you made:

 > This is currently the major source for system-specific versions of

I think you really said a mouthful there.  If one is writing software, I
think he would have much greater incentive to work on it if he could reach
more potential buyers.  Of course, all the stuff can be made to work if
strictly text-oriented functions are used, but that seems to be a terrible
waste of the fabulous windowing systems we have.  I would dearly love to see
some method by which the advanced features of all the systems could be
interfaced.  I mentioned in a previous post that it seems that maybe an
interface ala "gfx2" might be written, one for each system, to handle the
specifics for the advanced graphic calls.  Of course this would mean adding
an additional level of interfacing (above that of the specific windowing
system, but that would simplify the program writing process.  Maybe it
would be too complicated, but on the surface it looks feasible.  The method
I have in mind would be that if you wanted to create an overlay window,
you would issue the call "OWSet" to the interface module and it would, in
turn, hand it back to G-Windows or K-Windows as the appropriate call.

Do you reckon this might work?

    As I share his feelings I think I should respond to this question myself.

    Of course there's nothing *wrong* with text screen programs. However, I
happen to prefer to use and to write software that uses windowing to its
fullest extent. It's just a matter of personal prefernece. I use a word
processor on my MM/1 that uses windows over one that's text based, even though
the text based one has a number of other features that the windowing one
doesn't. I bought my MM/1 because of the promise of more powerful, more
versatile, cleaner looking windowing software.

    It's also possible to write graphics front ends for text based software, as
the developer of the text based word pro I was referring to collaborated with
another programmer to accomplish. However, even this kind of combination, for
me at least, doesn't have the same comfortable "look and feel" as a program
designed soley under windows from the start.

How about lha? It has a "-r" (recursive) option, that will do an entire

(Not sure on that, and am not on my MM/1 now, so can't check)

Tim,
 IMHO, for bundling up a large number of files, tar (or gtar) and gzip
seem to run faster than lha, and the end result is smaller.  I did a
comparison on a medium-huge pile of GNU-C source and gtar/gzip won.

The `-r' option isn't so useful, since the directory I want to archive
from has over 21meg of stuff in it and it's subdirectories.  By going
through a list of files, I've managed to trim that down to a mere
6meg that needs to go in the upload, so you can probably understand
my desire to be able to read a list of files from stdin.  John's
comment about compression is a good point, too.  Tar/GZip tends
to compress better, since GZip ends up compressing the whole shebang
at once, unlike most archivers that compress each individual file.
800 small files are unlikely to compress as well as a single
6meg file.

Is gtar here in the archive?  I have a `tar,' but when I did a dry
run at archiving the whole thing, it freaked out halfway through.
(I should try again, giving it more data space...)
   GZip faster than lha?  Hmmm...  I tried running gzip -9 on my
MM/1, and had a good nap before it was done.  Of course, it does
dearchive MUCH faster.  I've gotten in the habit of using gzip
before downloading things to my MM/1, since it saves a bundle of time.
But uploads I usually do uncompressed.

Hi, Tim -

Yes, OSTerm/68K has been considerably enhanced compared with OSTerm/6809
and TasCOM.  The current official release is version 2.2.0; however a few
folks have a "beta test" version 2.2.1.

I don't have a complete list of the changes, but will list the ones that
come to mind...  (I've included some of the known limitations, too.)

  - (prompted) ASCII file transfers are now fully implemented.  (Vaughn
    added them to the menus when he started working on them, but hadn't
    yet finished the code.)
  - Y-batch no longer resets the filelength to 0 on ASCII transfers.
    (Side-effect:  sometimes the xmodem padding will not be stripped.
    Perhaps a future release will cover this.)
  - provision added for 3 external protocols.  These are defined by the
    user in the osterm.config file, and become bound into the standard
    OSTerm Transfer and Filepicker menu sequences, just like the native
    protocols, so they appear fully integrated to the user.  (I use Zmodem,
    Kermit Binary, and Kermit ASCII).
  - ANSI emulation has been enhanced to include all of the normal
    IBM/BBS sequences, 16 foreground and 8 background colours (with
    correct palettes).
  - VT100 emulation has been significantly enhanced:
      - host programmable tabs (also, user settable in config file; default
        is the VT100 standard default)
      - scrolling regions (Version 2.2.0 only has absolute origin mode;
        V2.2.1 beta has relative origin mode, too).
      - User selectable "Newline mode" and "Autowrap at margin" added
      - many other changes/fixes too numerous to mention to bring it in
        line with the VT102 "ANSI" mode.
      - limitations: special character sets not supported; 80x24 mode only.
  - improved ANSI/VT100 keyboard emulations (e.g., "left arrow" and "ctrl-B"
    are differentiated), with online "Keyboard Assignments" menu
  - can generate a true "line break"
  - RTS/CTS or XON/XOFF flow control supported.
  - "Rate adjust" lock to suppress autobauding for modern high-speed modems
  - separate Options file for each port (/t0, /t3, etc.)
  - "Echo to file" (buffer capture) now strips linefeeds AND ANSI/VT100
    control sequences.  Also allows append-to-file.
  - A "binary" emulation mode has been added, to enable capture of all
    received data, but only printing "safe" characters to the screen.
  - Remote Mode can be enterred directly from command line:
             osterm -r
       (or)  osterm -r=/dd/directory_path_to_use
  - 7-bit mask (oops; bug in V2.2.0; fixed in V2.2.1 beta version)
  - numbers expanded to 24-digits in autodialer
  - a "graphical front end" for mouse addicts and to make it easier for
    casual users.  This is, frankly, a bit "clumsier" than we would like,
    but since our plans are to evolve OSTerm/68K away from its current
    K-Windows dependency, we implemented this as a separate module ("OST")
    to avoid putting more K-Windows stuff into the main program.
  - significantly improved manual written by Colin McKay.
  - many other tweeks and enhancements.

Hope this provides the info you wanted.

GREAT DESCRIPTION!!! CoCo OSTerm is really great, but just a few aggravating
details.

Ken,

The enhancements you describe are FANTASTIC!  Do I understand that the
ultimate goal is to make OSTerm compatible for all OSK platforms, or will
it be strictly MM/1?  I have a Delmar system and would really love to have
OSTerm running on it.  IMO, this is one void (especially for us non-MM1'ers)
that needs to be filled.

Heh, heh -- yeah, I know what you mean.  I don't pay enough attention
to the manuals, either.  But let's not tell Colin -- he put a lot of
work into it <g>.

Didn't know you had been encountering difficulties -- let me know if the
autowrap doesn't fix it.

This has been the plan, but office workload has pretty much brought things
to a grinding halt here since May.  We had hoped to have the non-KWindows
version well under development by now, but as it stands, that phase hasn't
even been begun, yet.  Sorry, but stay tuned.

Sounds good!  In particular, it sounds like you made an effort to address
the many problems in the VT100 emulation.  (BTW, if you want, I have
a bunch of test files for testing VT100, in the form of a fairly
thorough `test program' and a bunch of `VT100 movies' that exercise
VT100 emulations pretty thoroughly.  The test program also exercises
some VT102 functions.  Old OSTerm/Tascom failed these tests pretty
badly.  Seems it kept switching into `ANSI' emulation for no apparent
reason.)

You bet I'll stay tuned ..  I've heard of another Term program that's coming
out, maybe for G-Windows, but everyone needs at least 3 term programs at
hand <G>.  Seriously, I've grown quite accustomed to OSTerm, and all in all,
it's just hard to beat.  I do understand the problems of getting time to
get all the stuff done, though.

Hi, Tim -

 > Sounds good!  In particular, it sounds like you made an effort to address
 > the many problems in the VT100 emulation.

Yes, we've put considerable work towards making this a good, usable
implementation of VT100 emulation.  We probably still have a bit more work
to do.  My personal approach is that ANY _known_ limitations or bugs should
be documented, so the following exclusions were specified in the $READ.ME$
file for V2.2.0, released at the May Chicago Fest:

 | Current limitations include:
 |
 |        - only absolute origin mode is supported for scrolling regions
 |        - only 80x24 character mode is supported (no double-height,
 |          double width, nor 132 character width)
 |        - alternate character sets are not supported
 |
 | Known bugs/deficiencies:
 |        - the last character on a screen is not displayed, as this
 |          causes the screen to scroll.  When the line is scrolled,
 |          this character will be added to the scrolled line, except
 |          in the following case:
 |
 |        - when "Autowrap at margin" is "off", lines that contain
 |          EXACTLY 80 characters and which are initially printed on
 |          the last line of the display (or scrolling region), will
 |          not display the last character of the line after being
 |          scrolled upwards.

Since then, V2.2.1(beta) has added relative origin mode for scrolling
regions, and fixed a couple of bugs that were identified (7-bit masking
within VT100/ANSI sequences, the switching from VT100 to ANSI mode
"voluntarily" that you mentioned, and improved "bold" attribute handling).

Tim, I would really appreciate if you could forward those files.  I've
been meaning to pick some up, but it's always been "deferred"...  Most
of the testing has been against the facilities we have available.

     ANSI Considerations
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

I need some questions answered regarding ANSI emulation.

(1) I noticed that in some BBS's fancy ANSI graphics screens, a hex
    05 is embedded.  This 05 wreaks havoc, since it isn't part of an
    ANSI emulation string.  It gets printed as is, and the next character
    will turn off the cursor (this is in my ANSI emulation terminal
    program).  What is this 05 and how should I handle it?

(2) I notice that some BBS screens tend to send a "cursor left" ANSI
    sequence when the cursor is at column 0 (the left side of the screen)
    Currently, I'm just doing a cursor left, so the cursor backs up to
    the last character position of the previous line.  Thus, printing
    on the first line is skewed to the left one character.  Is the
    proper behavior in ANSI to NOT go to the left when the cursor is
    already at the left side of the screen?  I think this would fix
    things, but I'm not sure if it is the "ANSI" way to do it.


Any answers would be most helpful and most appreciated.

     From: GREGL        To: BOISY

I believe the ANSI specification is for Cursor Left and Cursor Right to move
the cursor the appropriate number of columns. If the cursor is on a line
boundary, the cursor does not move to the previous or next column. The $05
character is CTRL-E or ENQ and is typically used to ask about your terminal
capabilities. DEC terminals, for example, send a capabilities string. I
think ANSI and PC ANSI ignore ENQ. Also note that CompuServe sends ENQ to
initiate a CompuServe B or B+ protocol transfer.

Thanks for the confirmation.  I'll fix my program to reflect that.

I ran across another example of ctrl codes embedded in an ANSI graphic file.
Here's a partial dump:

1B 5B 30 3B 33 34 3B 34 30 6D 01 1B 5B 33 31 3B   .[0;34;40m..[31;
34 30 3B 31 6D 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20   40;1m

Note the Hex $01 on the first line after the '40m'.  This homes the cursor
under K-Windows, though I am blocking out ctrl characters.  I am wondering
what I should do in this instance.  Totally ignore it?  Replace it with a space?

THere is obviously some intent to use it, as it is bound between to different
'm' ANSI sequences.

My guess is that this turns all attributes off, prints a blue-on-black

I suspect the control character you are seeing is a printable character.
On the PC, all control characters with the common exception of CR and LF
are printable. Actually all of the control characters are printable, but
most terminal programs interpret CR, LF, TAB and BEL. There may be a few
others that are interpreted (VT is the typically the same as LF, for example,
and FF scrolls to the bottom of the screen).

On the VT100 (which is based on the same standard as PC `ANSI' emulation),
cursor movement commands never wrap lines.  In particular, the cursor
movement escape sequences are `visual', not `logical.'  I.e., `cursor left'
means `move the cursor left,' NOT `move the cursor to the previous
character.'  On the VT100, even BS doesn't wrap, although many VT100
emulators let BS wrap since so many people expect it to.

that dont match the new socket! A lot of us did this to the old TANDY disk

Well, as you know I made it Monday night, despite the fact that I

to add the Monday night class due to lack of transportaion, so I should

We are currently looking for a new columnist to take over Basic Training.
I did the first series on structured programming, and Wayne Campbell
wrote a programming series on how to write applications in Basic(09).
We are running the last few parts of his series now.  Wayne sold his
CoCo and bought a Mac and he's not involved with the OS-9 Underground
any longer.

If anybody is interested please contact me about writing Basic Training
or just submitting Basic09 programs.

I, personnaly still love Basic09, but relize that I need to concentrate
on learning C, so I started the Basic to C column to help others
learn C too.

Tried it by "displaying" the above codes over a serial link from my MM/1
to my PC clown running Telix.  Couldn't make out the exact colours (since
it is a monochrome monitor), but it generated a light grey happy face,
followed by a series of spaces (which subseqent characters sent indicated
were in a brighter hue).

Well, after reading your messages I dug out my copy of the ANSI X3.64
spec, and couldn't find anything specified the SOH character.  And, as
you noted, it must have been intended as a printable character, based
upon its position between the two ANSI Select Graphic Rendition
sequences.

So, I checked the character sets in my MS-DOS manual, and left you the
first message.  Then I tried it.  Sure enough.

That BBS is not just using "ANSI" -- it is using some PC-specific
stuff.

     CD-i Success!
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

Well, after fiddling with my new CD-i player, I managed to make a working
cable from its 8-pin mini-DIN to my MM/1 25pin serial.

Thanks to FHOGG's message buried way back in the forum, I was able to
call up the "service shell" which listed about 8 options.  These are
test modes for DRAM, NVRAM, VSC, and other hardware on the board.

This thing is so close to be an OSK computer, it's dangerous.

     From: CHARLESAM    To: BOISY

I recall a message you put up when you first got you CD-i. Correct me if I'm
mistaken. You said you can play games, listen to CDs, or watch movies(disk).
What your descibing sounds like the new Panasonic CD-i systems. I'm not
sure what they cost but I know they must go for at least $800. How much
did your CD-i peripheral cost? How does it compare with CD-i systems,
like the Panasonic. I'm thinking of upgrading soon and if I can add a
CD-i that compares favorably with those         on the market, I'll upgrade alot

sooner. Keep touting your new toy..... make us envious! ;-)
Even when I upgrade, I'll keep my Coco. I've gotten too comfortable to
part with it now. Regards Charlie

Panasonic has a CD-i player?  I wasn't aware of it.

Mine cost $499.00.  There is a smaller Magnavox version for $299.00, and
both have CD-RTOS (OS-9) built in.

Neither come with the DV cart., but it can be added.  The DV cart runs at
about $230-$250.  And believe me, it's worth it.

Check out your local Sears store for their CD-i system.  Let me know what
you find out.

     From: CHARLESAM    To: BOISY

The next time I go to the Mall, I'll get the info on the Panasonic. It
looks like an all inclusive system. Maybe I can get some pamphlets on it.
As far as Sears goes, I'll buy their tools but I'd avoid any electronics
with their name on it. Thats just my preference. I feel they have their
fingers in too many areas to be good at all of them.

I assume by DV cart you mean Disc Video. I'm wondering how well a video
would run on an MM1 monitor? And thats assuming the MM1 is my upgrade.

Now thats a subject I'd like to see discussed in a conference. What
are the pros and cons of the three upgrades available now for OS-9.
I'm referring to the MM1, System IV/V, Kix 20/30. If there is more
options them those, I'm not aware of them. I believe you have the
MM1, no? I'd definitely go that way but for the one sore spot I have
heard discussed here, and thats the monitor options for that machine.
Of course, I'm not that well informed and you can correct any miss
info I have.

I will post the info on the panasonic when I get it. Thanx for your
reply on the subject. Regards Charlie

Hi Charlie...

That's an excellent conference idea!  I'll have to keep that in mind.
You will be at the Atlanta Fest, won't you?

The CD-i will run on any monitor with RCA In Video, so a Maggie (commonly
used w/ the MM/1) would work with the CD-i player.

Looking forward to info on that Panasonic.  Thanks!

Grant it, you get that lifetime warentee on them hand tools, but it is not

    Panasonic makes the, (well only THE for right now as there are others in
development,) 3DO player, the direct competitor to CD-i. Philips, Magnavox and
Goldstar make CD-i players.

    No, Panasonic makes the only currently available 3DO player, CD-i's most
direct competitor. Philips, Magnavox and Goldstar are the companies making
CD-i players.

    After all that talk on CIS about the pitiful state of CD-i kiosks in Sears,
some of which was posted by you, how could you send a potential CD-i customer
there to be turned against the machine by what he's bound to see? He should go
to Best Buy or Incredible Universe instead.

There is no such thing yet or probably ever.  If you thin about, using
a VGA monitor on the Coco would be a waste anyway.  The monitor would
far exceed the resolution of the computer's video output.

Using a VGA monitor solely for the CoCo might be a waste, but you can purchase
a standard (640x480) VGA monitor cheaper than you can an analog RGB unit in
many cases, especially if a remanufactured one is found (around $175 vs. $250).
And what about those who already have the VGA for their PCs? A switch box or
physically moving the connector would make the monitor useable for both
machines. So such an animal would make sense, but may cost as much as another
monitor. Price one of the VGA to NTSC convertors... over $100.

   If someone really wanted to connect a VGA monitor to the CoCo, they could
purchase a multisync unit. I have heard of someone getting an NEC multisync

to sync with the CoCo. The only drawback: multisyncs are pretty expensive!
One _may_ be able to find a non multisync monitor that can handle the CoCo's
15.701 kHz horizontal signal, but I wouldn't know...

   I think that there is a file in the CoCo SIG Hardware Hacking Database that
explains how to use an NEC multisync, not sure though.
