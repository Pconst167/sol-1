Yes.. I know I did have the swamped DSR-CTS hack working flawlessly before
I changed the 6551. But one problem with that, is that hack then messed up
using swamped DSR and DCD operation... I'm not an assembly programmer, nor
do I play on on TV, so couldn't figure out that one...

To get the maximum possible throughput on a "moderm" modem, you need to set
the port speed to 4 times (at least) that of the raw speed. This is because,
for data compression to be effective between the modems, you have to be able
to transfer it to/from the modem faster at each end, then the modems  actually
talking to each other.

You should also be able to install another scsi47 driver set with different
names and use another two drives. Chris Burke says that can be done with the
CoCoXT drivers to support more than 2 drives (and CoCoXTs in that case), but
the drawback is the memory two sets of drivers take up. Of course your
situation would be temporary, so this should be acceptable- all you need to
do is make a boot disk with the two sets of drivers/descriptors while doing
the HD to HD backups.

That's what I was wondering about.  My 2400 modem in V.42bis would supposedly
be capable of nearly 9600.  If I set my CoCo to 4800, the only thing will be
that I won't get the speed the modem is capable of, isn't it?  I don't think
it will be able to handle 9600.  I can tell a big difference in text coming
across the screen @4800 vs 2400.

That makes sense, otherwise the data compression would be rather useless
with the port locked at the actual baud rate! Too bad the coco cant go
above 19200! Then we could speed up things a tad.

I had thought about doing that. using dEd to 'rename' CCHDISK to somethine
like 'CCBINKY' and having /h2 and /h3 look for 'CCBINKY' as the driver but
yeah, that would take up a LOT more room. the drawback is that Ken Scales
says the scsi47 drivers are 'hard coded' for only 2 drives. I wonder if that
means 2 drives at any address or 2 drives starting with the begining address?
If it is 2 at ANY address, then it could be done easily. If it is 2 drives
starting at the begining address then I would have 2 drives addressed the
same and may wind up with a real mess! Something to think about I guess.

Oh!  I stand corrected...  But way are You still using the unmodified port?
You should also patch all Your memory modules, for better operation.  All the

Before I purchased the 63C09 and NitrOS-9, I still was able to use 9600 baud

If you are having flow control problems, that is a different thing.  If
you don't need to hardware flow the chip, it works just fine at speeds up
to 19.2kbaud.  If your software was fast enough to receive data at 9600
baud, you wouldn't need flow control.

I seriously doubt that the chip causes any degradation in the serial
stream.  Too many programmers would like to blame their problems on
faulty hardware or compiler errors when the problem is their code.

But, in the 6551's case, the chip IS at fault for faulty (or at least
STUPID) handleing of a CTS transission... it stops transmission
IMMEDIATELY, even within the middle of a byte, and if it is in the
middle of a byte... if just throws out the rest of the bits! This IS
documented, and thus the reason the new version was designed.

Handshakeing is also necessary even if the transfer protocal is perfectly
capable of keeping up on an unloaded system, because, not all system
are always unloaded, and, on a CoCo, transmitting data bi-directionally
AND doing anything else is overloading the available CPU power.

Thanks for your input.  As you noted, the problem most people are
experiencing is software related, maybe 50% of that due to the
overhead of OS-9 (this is just a guess).

Yeah, when you have the GIME doing the IRQ handling, you probably
will have problems.  Again, this has nothing to do with the 6551,
but in the case, is a firmware problem.

The classic fix for this is the hard-wire IRQ hack.  I and many other
people did this a long time ago and the IRQ problems vanished.  I
don't know about all these other hacks to various OS-9 kernals to get
the same effect.  Perhaps they don't work as well as one would expect.
Also, there were problems with the original ACIAPAK drivers that many
people have been trying to get around for some time judging by the
number of drivers released over the years.

The most sure fix for CoCo serial problems is 1) do the hardware IRQ hack
and 2) get an ACIAPAK that works well, has a fairly large I/O buffer
and uses the suspend state.  Note that all these are not related to
the 6551, but fixes for other problems.

It has to do with the data compression, etc.  the faster the modem gets the
data the more efficiently it can send it in compressed mode.  The same goes
with decompression.
It seems the rule of thumb is the Comm port should be running at twicw the
speed of the actual connection of the modems.  If you are running a 9600
baud modem with error correction and data compression enabled and your Comm
port set at 9600 you will actually see a decrease in throughput.  Makes
sense when you think about it.

        But Mark, it does. Not per se, indeed the newer 65c51 is awful
decent for a single byte port, and the smarts in there are pretty cool.
While the hard fix or the newer software fixes ensure they (irqs) are all
handled, what I was driving at is the actual speed of the thing!
        They way babyOS9 operates, the LAST thing you want to do is trip
the irq code every 10 bits. How long one can _prevent_ recept of data
is not considered a feature here.

But, the CTS problem is only applicable to data going
OUT of the CoCo, right.  This is a possible problem if
1.   The other device, such as a modem, is not able to
     keep up with the CoCo's output.

2.   The port is set up for hardware handshaking.

3.   The data stream is steady (not "bursty").

It would seem that any problem would be less pronounced with
a faster modem because it would be able to avoid the need to
handshake with the CoCo.  A smaller transmit buffer might
be helpful, too.

Now we're talking about something completly different.  Like I said, I
don't doubt that the 6551 has some problems, but not being able to

Thanks, I thought maybe so... I may hook up my MPI and give it a try.  I
suppose then I will be able to use the hardware flow control?  I'm currently

xmode /Tx xtp=?p

where TX is the port,and "?p" is the number of pages of RAM to use as
buffer space (0-F, with the same high nibble that was there before)
A typical example is:
xmode /T2 xtp=04

for setting a 1024 byte receive buffer on /T2.

OK, I can live with that as I dont remember exactly how it is done! It's
been too long! If that is the case, what size buffer do I have set if I
have my /t2 xmoded to xtp=85??? That is where I run mine at and the system
works great. Just curious.

That would be a 1280 byte buffer... I cant recall what the "8x" part does.
is that for setting swamped DSR/DCD operation... It has been a LONG time

How do you set the buffer in Sacia? I also use T2 Sacia combo and have xtp=85
set in T2. But I have no idea how to set the buffer in sacia.

The buffer is set in the Descriptor (/T2) not the driver (Sacia)... You
set the buffer size by using the new xmode that came with SAcia, and changeing
the low nibble of the xtp byte to the number of 256 byte pages of system
RAM to use as buffer space... so.. your xtp=85 means you have 5 pages, or 1280
bytes... I can't remember off hand what the hight nibble of xtp does... chack
the manual/doc file that came with SAcia... it is ALL explaind there...

No, it's not discouraging at all! I'm not the admin here either, just an
operator (and handle 90% of maintenance also!). Good thing is I pretty much
have the system to myself over weekends and from 7:00pm in the evenings to
about 6:00am. I just published a backup schedule and for that time the
system is MINE! If I want or need to reset it, I do! Actually, we reset ours
about once every two weeks anyway- not for maintenance per-se, btu usually
because we've made some configuration change, and a new boot list has to be
made every time something is moved around. With 240 odd terminals, 50 odd
printers, and another 40 or so remote users (either dedicated phone line or
dial-up), things change occasionally! If I haven't reset the system in a couple
weeks, I do it anyway one night the backups go kind of fast.

An even more direct method of changing the ramdisk size, is by using MODED
the Module Editor ..... with it you can editor any module directly, even
os9Boot.  Look in your manual and read up on MODED ... its easy to use and
once you have finished editing, nothing else need be done, quick and easy.

I like it much better than using DMODE or reassembling from assembly source
code and using os9gen, etc.

Okay, folks ------ the CoCo2 Emulator Rev 1.3 now runs Level One OS9 as
per the author's latest efforts at improving this MS-DOS program that
supports our favorite machine, the Color Computer 2, actually one of our
favorite machines.  The author states that he may code up an Emulator for
the CoCo-3 (in the future when he has more time), especially if it were
a commercial program (maybe $25 or so).

This is hot off Internet! Enjoy!

For more support of emulator type programs, access ACS BBS in Atlanta

Level 2.

the CoCo)

Yeah, if a coco 3 emulator that ran OS-9 Level 2 (though I bet some
patches wouldnt work, if the patch requires a special hardware mod..)
were available..I dont think there would be a heck of alot to stop me

The best word processing program under RS-DOS is Telewriter 128, but its
distributor, Cognitec, seems to have disappeared.  It is both powerful and
very easy to use.  If you can find someone willing to sell his copy, buy it.

The next best under RS-DOS is  Simply Better, available from Rick's Computer
Enterprise at (606) 787-5783.

Under OS9, the best (again, IMHO) is VED and VPRINT from Bob van der Poel in
Canada at (604) 866-5772.  It is very similar to Telewriter, and you have all
the advantages of OS9.

Max-10 is a WYSIWYG word processor (mouse-based) under RS-DOS, available from
Alpha Products in Connecticut at (203) 656-1806.  The advantage to this one is
that it is like a desktop publishing program, meaning there are a lot of
different fonts available for it.  You could use it to make your own newspaper.
You are limited to the fonts in your printer with the other ones.  It is
also easy to use; my 14-year-old daughter uses it all the time.

BTW, CoCo Max III and Max-10 are still available from Alpha Products

There's a darn good reason why VED/VPrint are similar to TW-128. While TW-128
was marketed by Cognitec, it was written by Bob van der Poel!!!

I don't have a problem with orphanware in concept... but one DOES need to
be responsible in searching out those who no longer support a program. And I'd
say wait a reasonable time before accepting anything as "orphaned" ... say at
least three years. But that pretty much leaves most CoCo stuff open, doesn't it?

I understand the possible legal implications, but in order to sue for damages,
one has to establish that sales were lost and damages incurred. Now, that would
be hard to do since the software hasn't been marketed for years! About the
only thing someone could do in this case would be to stop the distribution of
the software. I understand the copyright laws enough, I actually have on fully
registered copyright under the old laws (circa 1983... they were changed
around 1989 to the current standard where anyone puting a copyright notice on
an item is protected). I also talked with a lawyer about this.... unless
damages can be proven, you couldn't even get your legal fees back!

SuperComm v2.2, and KQ3/LSL all have one thing in common. They all use
virtual IRQs. There was a problem with the original issue OS-9 that affected
VIRQs. The easiest way to fix it is to use the INIT module from Fight Sim 2,

It is my understanding that the 2xx series of gcc included C++ support.
But don't quote me on that.....I've never tried it.

The archive on chesnut is 2.5.6 and does not contain a cc1plus file, just gcc2
cc2, cccp2, and the library and a couple of header files.  gcc is the driver,
cc1 (2?) is the C compiler and cccp is the pre-processor.  cc1plus (if it would
be there) is the C++ compiler.

     MM/1A Mouse Sanctification
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

After twiddling a bit with the msdrv disassembled code, I now have a source
code file which will assemble into either a mouse systems module *or*
a Microsoft/Logitech module.

Just to be sure it worked, I went out and purchased the same Logitech
TrackMan I did a week ago, hooked it up and now it works fine!  All
three buttons now function properly and the mouse cursor moves gracefully.

I've forwarded my changes to others for integration, so these modules
should be available soon.

Humm, seems I've got one of those bieasties at work & I think its got
a 68008 in it. Runs unix, BSD4.2 I think, never been able to get into it
due to unix's overblown security.  No need to really, I just call NCR/ATT
when it goes kaflooey, which it does quite regularly, usually due to a
flaky power supply or blown modem. It runs our CBS message system, receiving
data over a tletext (teletext) stream in the vertical interval, helps to
edit our replies, and modems them back to CBS. I'ts been pretty good since
I told them to either fix it or get that firetrap outta my building! I got
sick of smelling smoke all the time 'cause the techs couldn'tmber to
loop the ps wires back outta the fan blades. Its put together sorta weird
as you know.  That hump that holds up the greennie screen is the power
supply, and so far no two motherboards or power supplies have come out of
stock with compatible connectors, always a jury rig of some kind. /send nimitz

I think you may want to check the plate for the model number. The 6300 was
part of AT&T's Intel-based PC series. My May 1985issue of BYTE (which has
the machine you refer to on the cover), simply refers to it as "The AT&T
Unix PC", but I believe it also was known as the 7300.

BTW, the CPU is a 10Mhz 68010.

Maybe, but it doesn't resemble the pix I've seen of the 7300. And Intel
sure didn't make the cpu thats in it.  I wonder how many diff prod runs
there might have been too, the one time I picked up the motherboard to
look, it did have a 68008!  But then this boards been swapped out at least
4 times now, and none of them were totally plug compatible with the
previous occupant of the bottom of the box! Maybe some did have 68010's
as they would be essentaiilly plug-n-play in that app. Cheers, Gene

OK.  I agree.  It would be hard to imagine one of their machines with anything

The version of UNIX is a moot point. AT&T sells machines to many vendors. If a
custom software/machine vendor set up the PC7300 they may not have purchased
the operating system from AT&T with the machines. So the PC7300 could very well
have come with "BDS"
 or whatever UNIX. I see this on the AF base all the time. We have some
"Monaco" automated fire alarm systems. The control unit is a Tandy 1000TX (286)
with a special BIOS in it. As far as we can tell, the only reason for the odd
BIOS is so the Monaco soft
ware won't run on anything else!! (no standard clone).

Yes the 7300 may come from a vendor with some other flavor of UNIX but
1. I would imagine that it would come from AT&T with their version when it
   goes to the vendor
2. In my limited (very limited) contact with a number of machines, I haven't
   seen any with anything other than System V.  Maybe someone else could
   jump in if they have seen anything different on one.
As far as the AF machines go, well, sometimes the military does have a
"different" way of doing things than everyone else.  BTW, I think that special
BIOS is an excellent idea for preventing software piracy.  Of couse it shoots
s all to heck (Grin).  This all started because of confusion between

the 6300 and the 7300 which seems to me like confusing MS-DOS and OS-9 (ducking
and smiling...)

Of course... you can always look up the information in the OS-9 Technical
referance section. You should be able to find out whay bytes to patch
in the information on SCF file descriptors, and then use modpatch to make the
changes... This gives you a much more fuller understanding about how OS-9
works, and helps you to develop the skills to figure these types of changes
on your own in the future...

I don't mean to sound like I'm "ragging" on you... but if more people

people wouldn't have to answer the same old questions over and over, again

I discovered something today that seems to be virtually unknown in the CoCo

sold for the Color Computer is still available by special order at your local
Radio Shack, and at very reasonable prices, in most cases.  This includes such
titles as "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" @ $4.95, "Leisure Suit Larry"
@ $4.95, "Tetris" @ $19.95, "C Compiler" @ $69.95, and "TSSpell" @ $10.95.  I
have the first edition of the Express Order catalog, dated 1988, and almost
everything listed in there for the CoCo is still available.  However, it is
NOT available through Express Order!  All this CoCo software has to be special
ordered from what is called the Consumer Mail Center.  There is a catalog
listing everything in a large red binder.  It also includes printwheels for
daisy wheel printers, vacuum tubes, etc.  I was told that every company-owned
Radio Shack should have one of these Consumer Mail Center catalogs.  You will
most likely have to talk to the manager because even very few Radio Shack
employees know about this.  Check it out!

put tsmon in /dd/cmds but with the filename autoex (for auto-execute, this
can be done for any os-9 command) I am willing to bet that the reason
the window "locks up" is that it trys to find autoex, but cant, and doesnt
have a process to fork, cc3go dies, and of course doesnt have a parent since
it is a system-boot process, so you end up staring at a blank window..
is this package PD? if so is it for OS-9/6809 or OS-9/680x0? if it is
for either you should upload it here, if it is for 6809, I am gonna have
to make it a point of grabbing a copy :)

   The program is _already_ here on Delphi.  Look in the telecommunications

I think.  The package has an Ipatch for cc3go and a program called autoez. I
had already named autoez autoex.  I will however name tsmon autoex and see it
that does it.  cc3go is supposed to die become a non-active process.

If you have an RS232 pak, you should be able to transfer the files at
19200, might have to go with 9600 if your system doesnt have all the "right"
patches..one thing though, why not just transfer them by diskette?

there is a patch in the system modules database to read/write PC floppies
just format a bunch of PC floppies, and copy all the files over..
there is even a command to do a "dsave" like copy of all files on a floppy
