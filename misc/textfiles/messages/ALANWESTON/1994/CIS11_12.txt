The pipe approach sounds best (a loaded data module might also work) but I'm
trying to avoid doing any .ASM.  Only tool that comes with the processor in
question is BASIC-09; ASM is extra cost.  Plus, ASM means I've really go to go
find the OS-9 operating system docs.

Can I get there (data modules or pipes) from BASIC-09?  I can set it up so that
the processes are parent/child (via a shell prob&) from the parent process.

Thanks for your thoughts,

Dick Watson

I believe so, by B09 is not my strong suit (I'm a C geek). I believe that
between using the SYSTEM() calls and a subroutine called 'syscall' you should
be able to do most of what you need.

You may find data modules a bit easier.

Well, I didn't exactly want to know what ADDR() returned.  This I pretty much
knew.  What I wanted to know is what did the structure stored at that location
look like.  (Didn't TRS-80 BASIC store a DIM out there too?  That's what I was
wondering...)  What I've learned is that if I want some other module to be able
to look at a string safely, I have to somehow get it both ADDR(mystring$) and
SIZE(mystring$) so that I know where to poke about and where not to.

Whole reason to know this was that I'd like to be able to implement an
inter-process communications scheme for passing vlidated messages recieved in
realtime to a lower priority process that breaks them back and can queue them.
I still don't know a good way to do this.  The LOADed data module seems like
one way, but the complications to doing this without ASM are not clear.  Using
pipes may also be a way, but what would this look like from a B09 code/shell
procedure point of view?

Thanks for continued thought stream!  My system hardware should be here in a
few weeks so these will no longer be academic issues!

 I believe Peripheral Technology still has several copies of the older

Umm, yes!  I never used Home Publisher, but I did read in MOTD several years
ago in an article where someone attempted to install it on a HD.  He seemed to
be constantly encountering problems.  IS is hardcoded to /dd/CMDS? if not, you
might put them in a seperate directory.  Then you could set up a procedure file
to "chx","chd", and whatever needed, and finally executes the Home Publisher
program.

Utilities? You mean the general utilities, like ident, etc?  I'd say these
should be in /dd/CMDS.  If any of these were called by HP, or any other app,
and you had "chx"ed, then you would have to have copies of these in the
alternate directory.  Note that the shell+ "path" cmd does not carry down into
programs called by shell.

Thanks for the reply David. It seems that what I'm looking for is the procedure
file to chx and chd. I understand what you are saying about the utilities.  I
was thinking more of things such as patch or repack. Probably more appropriate
would be a games exec. dir so I dont have to scroll through Mickey & Donald &
soforth. Guess I'll just have to roll the dice and try it. Fouling up the hard
disk structure is an abhorant thought.

Probably the best way is to turn off echo, but a quick fix for your routine

        GET #0,userinput

Fm: Rogelio Perea 72056,1204
To: ALL

I must say that Dale L. Puckett's Official Basic09 Tour Guide is one of the
best books available for the Color Computer. After reading it and trying out
the examples I came across several "bugs" which I will outline here, maybe I am
doing something wrong on my end so I would like your comments:

On page 89 there's a procedure called "echoforawhile":

         PROCEDURE echoforawhile

         DIM char:BYTE

         LOOP
           GET #0,char
         EXITIF ASC(char)=$1B (* ESCAPE *)
           PRINT "Don't frown, you told me to ESCAPE."
         ENDEXIT
           PUT #1,char
         ENDLOOP
         END

here, char is declared as BYTE, but ASC evaluates STRINGs, so the CoCo reports
an error; I had to use EXITIF ASC(STR$(char))=$1B to use the procedure. Also,
it seems that $1B is not evaluated at all.

Turning to page 90, let us examine the procedure "exitgracefully":

         PROCEDURE exitgracefully
         DIM num,val,minimum:INTEGER

         num:=100 \ minimum:=-10

         REPEAT
           num:=num-1
         EXITIF num<0 THEN
           PRINT "Error - You can't take the square";
           PRINT "root of a negative number!"
         ENDEXIT
           val:=val+SQRT(num)
         UNTIL num < minimum
         END

the problem I found here is that "val" is a reserved word, so to get this
procedure working I had to change the variables's name to "value".

Going over to page 95, my CoCo III busts out with:

         PROCEDURE positiontest
         DIM yes:BOOLEAN
         yes:=TRUE
         WHILE yes DO
           PRINT "OK";
           yes:=POS x 50
         ENDWHILE
         END

the sixth line has an error, it should read -->  yes:=POS<50

Pages 100 and 101 have a procedure called "dayofweek" showing how to use the ON
... GOSUB control structure:

         PROECDURE dayofweek
         DIM day:INTEGER
         day:=1+INT(RND(6))
         ON day GOSUB 10,20,30,40,50,60,70

      10 PRINT "Sunday" / RETURN
      20 PRINT "Monday" / RETURN
      30 PRINT "Tuesday" / RETURN
      40 PRINT "Wednesday" / RETURN
      50 PRINT "Thursday" / RETURN
      60 PRINT "Friday" / RETURN
      70 PRINT "Saturday" / RETURN

well, all those slashes are backwards!!. To get it right I had to replace them
it the "inverse backslash" --> \

I'm almost through with this, so moving to page 119:

         PROCEDURE makefile

         TYPE inventory_item=name:STRING[25];list,cost:REAL;qty:INTEGER

         DIM inventory_array(100):inventory_item
         DIM work_record:inventory_item
         DIM path,counter:BYTE

         CREATE #path,"inventory"

         work_record.name:=""
         work_record.list:=0.
         work_record.cost:=0.
         work_record.qty:=0
         FOR counter:=1 to 100
           PUT #path,work_record
         NEXT counter
         END

my CoCo gives an error when DIMensioning counter as BYTE, but changing that to
DIM counter:INTEGER fixed things up. And to finish this up there's only one
more typo on page 136 with the AUTOMULT procedure. It seems that when printing
this page of the book a carriage return was overlooked and the procedure
PRINTANSWER began where AUTOMULT ended. Both work OK but as typed the
procedures can cause some confusion to the untrained eye.

There they are. Am I correct in assuming these could be described as bugs or
did I slip somewhere in the programs?. I haven't seen anywhere any information
on corrections to this book so all comments will be greatly appreciated...

I haven't looked at that book for years...and I never did type in all the
examples. Looks like you have found some typos.

In echoforawhile, you can leave 'char' as a BYTE, if you change the test line
to:

        EXITIF char=$1B THEN  (* ESCAPE *)

To really get it to work, you'll have to zap out the EOF value in the path
descriptor.

In makefile, all loop counters in for/next have to REAL or INTEGER.

Looks like someone decided to 'clean up' the code before it was printed.

If memory serves, the source for the finance program is in one of the libraries
here.

There's one more thing that slipped my mind also, in the Blackjack programs, I
think one of the called procedures in one of the modules is missing. I do not
recall right this minute which one is... would it be helpful to compile the
bugs into a file as to distribute it here and in other BBS 'round the country?

Peter, Sorry if some earlier messages misled you. I'm not writing a CD ROM
driver set. I'd like one... Carl Krieder has written a series of utilities
which work on the mm/1 which read CDROMS. They should work on other scsi
systems too (however, I tried them on my mvme 147s and they didn't). You might
want to contact Carl to get more information. I believe he was planning on
writing a file manager (the guts for the manager are all embedded in the
utilities right now). Don't know what the status is. I do know that several
folks are reading CDS on the mm/1 right now. I have a drive and mm/1...however,
I have to take things apart to add in another scsi port and just haven't felt
like it. Maybe this week.

BTW, Carl's CIS ID is 71076,76; however it doesn't appear that he is checking
in too often here. Don't know if he has an internet address?

Hope this helps.

Bob.

Yes, you should call Microware and order "OS-9 Insights", a book which has
sample file managers in C and some driver samples.

Another book to get is "The OS-9 Guru, Part 1", which you can get here in the
states from Windsor Systems, I believe.  Someone online can post the address
(I've been looking for that address, too!)
