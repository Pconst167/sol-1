If I remember rightly, that's one thing that's different between
OS-9/6809 and OS-9/68000.  OS-9/68000 will queue signals; OS-9/6809
won't.

Have you passed this message on to Bob Billson yet?  If so, then why do
you keep posting bug reports to ALL?  It is really annoying to the
authors of any software to see any problem reports posted to the public
without having you contact them first, and giving them a chance to
respond.

There is an update to UUCPbb due out soon which will address at least one
of the problems you mentioned, if not more.

I'm not trying to put you down here, just trying to get you to send your
bug reports to the author, and give him a chance to respond to them before
his reputation as a programmer, and that of his package gets tarnished.

UUCPbb is a good working package.  No need to complain about it publicly
before you even contact the author and give him a chance to fix it.

TTYL. Colin.

Colin,
     Certainly I have sent msg. to the author about it and I wait several
days for an answer. I use my Fido to Usenet path to send to the Internet 
address.  I did receive the comp.os.os9 news article about the upcoming
new release from Bob Billson and Co. 
     Lately since my UUCP (or my MM/1 compilation of it) has gone south
when I try to send mail out I have to use my Fido system to send
Internet and also the regular echo mail.  But make no mistake I did have 
my UUCP working fine except for the reply option in the readnews and
postnews wouldnt work.  And there was an admitted bug causing this.
     In fact I have recompiled several times, rebuilt all the .xxx files 
to start over and still it refuses to send anything.  I could go on for
many pages of what all I have tried to no avail including 4 differant
varietys of 'chown'.  So what we need is some constructive help from
users not  questions such as what you ask.  YOU SHOULD read the
Fido policy which clearly states that user posting msg's should not
easily take offence nor be easily annoyed.   
    And another thing, I am not complaing about the authors programming
nor the fact they sometimes take a while to reply.  You must realize
that sometimes a person overlooks an obvious item in setting up
something that someone else can help with.  That is what this Echo was
started for.  I have had 7 years of working with RiBBS and found
that when helping others many odd things can happen to foul it up.  Thus 
was born 'RiBBS to Go' !  It may be once we all get working well that it 
would be an  easy thing to also set up a 'UUCP to Go' package that can
be had for the cost of mailing a few stamps or $ and getting it in mail.
     I do not profess to be very smart about programming but I can
follow good instructions such as was done in the UUCPBB20 package but I
am usually the one that missreads an instruction or missunderstands the 
implication and then cant figure where I went wrong.
    I just posted a new report about my problem since I have waited for
several days for the normal reply from the author.  In it I clearly
state that I have sent direct to the author the report.  I believe I
also mentioned that it was not a bug report but rather a system problem
unique to my system.  So if you can offer constructive help great
otherwise if you tend to be easily annoyed by msg's posted to 'All'
about problems then either don't read the echo anymore or if you want I
will give you the job of being moderator !!   8->  
    BTW This past week has seen our local Fido system having trouble
receiving the Echo backbone.  They are working with Planet Connect but
are experiancing poor dish reception so that may be why mail has been
delayed going in or out from here. But sending from my Usenet gateway
and receiving on my MM/1 UUCP has worked fine.

Colin,
      I kept digging and finally found my UUCP MM/1 system goof.
What I had done was edit the sequence.xxx files in the /dd/sys/UUCP dir
to have 0 in order to start over with no msgs or news articles.
      *WRONG MOVE*. the sequence.spool file has the msg numbers in 4
digit syntax. I had edited to one digit (0) and thus got the error
'msendfile can't open '' .  Once I deleted all the sequence.xxxx files
and cleared out my msgs in usr dirs and articles in the
/dd/usr/spool/news dirs all was OK. 
      Still have the postnews, reply to news and followup news bug but
that is a known bug and hope it gets fixed when the new release is out.
(warren@ocnbeach.jd.com)
PS My Fido hub has been changed so I may have missed some mail and I am
not sure this is getting out but will give a try.

Hi, Warren.

I've responded to your last message in a private message.

Towards constructive suggestions:

 o chown is part of the carlutils.ar package which you may already
   have

 o clear out any files (but not directories) in usr/spool/uucp/* and
   its subdirectories.  See if that makes any difference.  If that fails,
   then:

 o clear out anything at all that has to do with uucpbb from your
   hard drive, and start over from absolute scratch (don't forget to
   write down your passwords, though)

It sounds like some of the leftover files are messing things up.

TTYL. Colin.

Colin,
     Fido mail has been messed up all over for last few weeks so maybe
by the time you read this you will have seen my previous post about the
files 'sequence.xxxx' in the /dd/sys/uucp dir.  Anyway for sake of
clarity I will repeat, *NEVER* edit those files when wanting to clean up 
things, just delete all the sequence.xxxxx files and UUCP will recreate
them from scratch.
     The key to this was my outgoing mail pkts had only a 0 at end of
the filename and should have had a 4 digit number. That is why I got the 
'msendfile cant open '' ' error.
     I have installed the chown from Carls utils and only problem is the 
superuser is only one that can postnews and reply to news wont work so
lets hope the update fixes that.
    Thanks for the answers and help, later,
-Warren (warren@ocnbeach.jd.com)

 While at the Chicago Fest, one of the venders showed me a prototype
clone of "Wolfinstein". It was fantastic. He is also thinking of making
a C library of his routines. If he does that, what out, hi-tech games
will pop up everywhere. I asked him to let me know when the game is
ready to sell. I want a copy bad.
 
  If you never gone to a COCO FEST, you gota go.

Subject : UUCP now working
Date    : 94/05/29  15:36:00

After searching hi and low, I found the bug in my system setup.
I had mistakenly edited the sequence.xxx files in the /dd/sys/uucp dir to 
be all at 0, BIG MISTAKE!. the sequence.spool uses a four digit number or 
hex number so when I set to 0 none of my outgoing mail pkt had right
file address, they would be "C.jadpc0" instead of "C.jadpc0000" and the
other two same thing. So I just cleaned up the sequence files by
deleting them and letting uucp restart them and now it is all working
sending msg. out no problemo!
     Now just waiting on the update to fix the reply to news article and 
postnews bug.
     In the meantime I am getting mail and comp.os.os9 news group and
can send mail answers out no problem.
(warren@ocnbeach.jd.com)
PS my apologys to anyone I may have upset thinking I was blaming the
programmers,  It was a pure goof on my part.
PS2 I am posting on the CoCo Exchange cause my Fido system has been
reassigning a hub for me but just today got my Fido mail back on new
hub.

Sounds cool John. Does it use the Wolfenstein screens from the PC version and
run under an OSK engine? Thanks for the info. How about a description of the
fest from an MM/1 owner's point of view.

Sure you remember me.  I'm the owner of Northern Xposure, and one of the

Ken was the one with the beard, while I was the taller one. (But nowhere near 
as tall as Alan DeKok.)

Mind you, Alan was on his knees for much of the Fest, demoing the

Tim,
  They came over and I showed them KTerm. As programmers do, they were
quick to point out the suttle differences. I guess as a return favor.
HEHEHE. 
  We did notice some big differences:
 
  OSTerm has buttons down both sides of the screen.
  KTerm use the standard KWindow meathod
  OSterm has a full size shell window
  KTerm has a 80X10 shell window located at the bottom of the screen.
  OSTerm the user has to  start a zmodem download
  KTerm zmodem download is automatic.
 
 Both use a outboard zmodem process.
 Both use either flow control or hardware control of ports.
 Both will do 38KBaud
 
 I was impressed with OSTerm and they were impressed with KTerm.

Hi, Tim.  Guess John really doesn't remember me!  He only showed KTerm to
Ken, not me, although I did discuss it at length with David Graham.  Both
OSTerm 68K and KTerm use K-Windows, but in different ways.
     OSTerm 68K can be run in two modes.  The command OSTERM behaves just
like the Level II version of OSTerm, opening up an 80x24 window, with
popup windows.  If you've used OSTerm under Level II, you'd be quite
comfortable with OSTerm 68K.
     To take advantage of the K-Windows mouse, OSTerm also comes with a
graphical front end, called OST.  This provides a point-and-click
interface for most functions.  Both OST and KTerm open up a type-6
90x30x16 color screen. KTerm then creates an 82x28 framed window on that
screen, with an 80x25 working area, something like this:

  +---------------------------------------------------+
  | o File  Protocol  Baud  Parity  Flow  Phone  Help |  (Sorry for the
  |              2400,N,8,1 cd none XModem            |  brevity, but I
  +---------------------------------------------------+  needed the space!)
  |                  80x25 working area               |
  +---------------------------------------------------+
     Across the top are standard K-Windows style pull-down menus --
closebox, File, Protocol, etc.  Second line shows the status.
     The OSTerm screen, using the OST Front End, looks like this:

ComPort /t3           OST Version 2.2.0                   Screen /w4

Clr +---------------------------------------------------------+ v

First line is for status.  Second line is the quit and primary function
buttons, which also correspond to the function keys.  Down the left side
are the Macro Edit, Macro (A-J), Remote Mode, and Screen clearing buttons.
On the right are the buttons used to respond to menus.
     Essentially you have OST literally framing OSTerm.  OST, from the
users point of view just acts as a keyboard filter (In addition to setting
up the screen, palettes, and fonts).  Anything typed on the keyboard is
passed on to OSTerm for handling.
     For function keys, the appropriate key sequence is passed.  For
example, pressing F1 would send the key sequence for Help, Alt-/, to
OSTerm. Same thing happens when you press one of the buttons framing
OSTerm. Clicking Clr sends the Alt-`, or clear screen code.
     A similar -- though far more complicated -- Front End is distributed
with Bob van der Poel's VED.  A front end also exists for InfoXpress.
     Download protocols, as John mentioned, are also handled differently. 
Right now ZModem auto-starts for downloads on KTerm, but not OSTerm. 
External protocols are handled a little differently as well.  Under KTerm,
the external protocols are handled internally.  OSTerm has a built-in
brief scripting language that enables users to tell OSTerm how to handle
other external protocols. (ie if somebody ever ports jmodem or sealink to
OSK, KTerm will need to be modified and recompiled to handle the new
protocol, while OSTerm only requires that a config file be modified.)
     Overall performance (speed and reliability) seems similar, although I
must admit that there haven't been any head-to-head tests done.  It is
great that there are two competing commercial terminal programs, as this
can only be to the benefit of all involved.  Both programs have many
features that haven't been mentioned here, but are covered in the manuals.
