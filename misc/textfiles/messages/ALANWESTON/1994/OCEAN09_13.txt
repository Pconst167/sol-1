Digby Tarvin does that , from Australia, but I don't have an address
or phone for him.   I also have yet to receive either Amiga or Atari
versions of KWindows for resale.

I am looking once again for an MM/1 backplane.  The old ones.
I'll pay up to $20 for them so if you have an 8 meg backplane and have
not sent your old one to me, please do!

At this time, it is certain that several bugs have been introduced into
KWindows version 52.   As I rarely use these features, I'd like to
thank those who brought them to my attention.
 
1.  The Move Windows and Move Windows Back functions don't work. 
 
2.  It seems likely that a bug that caused the pushbutton function to 
    occaisionally redraw the button in reverse video is still active.
 
 
   I'm requesting that these bugs be squashed, and if anyone has
located any others in Windio52 - please let me know!

It perhaps merits mention that one of the things that would be of
greatest help to whoever is squashing bugs is a _short_ program
(with source) that demonstrates the bug.

Thanks, David... I believe these comments trace back to the files I
submitted a few weeks ago.

For others: A little elaboration on the second item: the bug is that when
a pushbutton gadget ($1e28 ...) is released, the button is redrawn using
whatever text attributes are currently active -- the button label may
be re-written with reverse video, underlining, a different font, etc.
There is an inordinate amount of code in KVed to work around this bug.

Regards... / Ken

I got the address for Digby Tarvin from Microware.  Perhaps he has
KWindows?

  I am porting some COCO OS9 LII Basic09 code to the MM/1 using MW
Basic. I have found all the Get/Set codes that SYSCALL uses except the
following. I beleive these are COCO OS9 LII specific.
 
  $17
  $18
  $19
  $1f
 
   If you need to see how these are used, I can post those parts of the
program that uses these SYSCALL codes.

 Warren, (egg on face) this is one of the few mods that won't play
using `strack'.  The mod file has to be converted with `tracker' to
be able to be usable.  Sorry for my screw up on this one (blush).
 
   If you want the file, let me know and I'll reupload it.

John,
      Many thanks for clearing it all up.  BTW once you run tracker,
'tracker -f (oldfile) (newfile)' it should be noted that it will play
useing hdplays not strack as it is no longer a mod file.
      It is a good stereo sound file to wake up the neighbors (G).
