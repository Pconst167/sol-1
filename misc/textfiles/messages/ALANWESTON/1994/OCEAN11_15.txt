  This may be slightly off-topic, but it's for a very good cause, so 
I hope no one minds.  I have a friend who's gathering all available 
data to help a friend of his who's blind.  He's looking for any and 
all info re *any* computer hardware and/or software that could help 
blind people: ASCII-to-Braille translators, voice recognition, voice 
synthesis, voice control of computers and other equipment, 
amateur-radio uses of such technology, devices that "read" normal 
books and "speak" the words, anything and everything.  He's 
especially interested in any info re a technology called "CCC" which 
(I believe) stands for "Continuous Communication Control".  Please 
net-mail me any leads (books, magazine articles, names/addresses of 
software/hardware companies, reviews of products, names/addresses of 
computer hobbyists or groups who use or promote such technology, BBS 
or Internet conferences, etc.

  I'll keep on file a copy of all the data I collect, and will be 
happy to e-mail it to anyone who could use it.  I may not be able to 
reply and personally thank everyone who sends me info, but let me 
thank you all in advance for any leads you can forward, and I 
likewise extend the thanks of my friend, and his friend who I'm sure 
will greatly appreciate such information.

  Thanks!

  Cheers, Frank

I have a week off to recuperate from my surgery yesterday, and plan to
work on KWindows documenation.   I would appreciate any comments from
KWindows users on tricks you commonly use, including use in procedure
files, and comments on any things you might think were bugs.  Please
let me know what version you are running as well....

40 meg drive on it and replaced and am installing backups now.

Hi Everyone.
Just a short letter of inquiry.

I live in Toronto, Canada so anyone not from this area can disregard the 
following.

I am currently enrolled in an Electronics Technology Program 
full time, and I finish at 1:30pm.  I am looking for a part-time 
postion in the field of electronics.  To be honest, up until this 
past trimester (5th), I had a GPA of 3.29 .  Unfortunatly I went 
through a serious crisis with my wife and my GPA dropped to 2.93.

I am a hardworking individual, and I learn very quickly.  My skills 
include the use of test equiptment such as scopes and DMM's. 
I also have experience in reading schematics, and testing circuits.

My strongest interest is in the field of microprocessors, and computers.
I have done some assembly language programming on the 8085, and I am 
currently studying the 8086/88 family.  I have a lot of PC experience
as well.  I have done both hardware, and software installation and 
trouble shooting.  

My PC experience also includes setting up OS/2, DOS/Windows, A Windows for
workgroups Peer to peer network, and Linux.

I also spent 5 years in the Canadian Forces Reserves.  I aquired working 
as a member of a team, and as a team leader.

If you happen to be looking for a young, energetic electronics student 
for your company, (or know someone who is) please contact me at 
(416) 742-5398 day or night.

Thank you for your time.

Rob Stewart


P.S.  Sorry for the cross posting but I am really quite desperate.

     James, Thanks for the info on the K&R C programming book.  I got my 
hands on one just a few days ago <G>!
