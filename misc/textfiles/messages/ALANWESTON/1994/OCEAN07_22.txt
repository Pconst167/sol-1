 Whoops! Where did this come from??? I have been on a short vacation
and it seems my mind went with me but never came back. I seem to have lost the

 thread somewhere and cannot recall the circumstances of this conversation. 
Pardon the wanderings of an old man!!!!!!

Warren, I was making a joking refferal to the fact that Sierra Hotel is
a phonetic abbreviatioin for a commonly use military phrase meaning
"most excellent!".   As moderator, I need to ask you if it is OK to say
SHIT HOT on a Fido Echo??  ;)

David,
      It is a general rule within Fido that bad language not be used. 
Thus as Moderator I would have to say it is disallowed.

David
I have been unable to get a chinon drive to work also. If you find any
model 5 1/4 drive that will work on an MM1 I would appreciate learning
about it. I have an extensive library of coco disks that I would like to 
be able to use.

Thanks, Paul.   I had an FD55B in my CoCo - newly installed, never
used, so I sent that one out - wiith the customers approval.   It works 
fine!!  
 
BTW - all MM/1 Owners out there might want to send me their addresses
over the next month or two.   I need to update the ancient addresses
I'm receiving from IMS as Paul Ward cleans out his files!

The update disk with Windio52 will be available in a very short time.
Included are all the latest drivers.
If you are interested I will have listed in my 'ordersoft.txt' in a week 
or so.  Cost is supposed to be less than $20 with S/H included.
The MM/1 Tech Manual is available again at a reduced price, check my
ordersoft.txt.
Watch for a beta copy of OSK-RiBBS.  John A Donaldson is making real
progress porting it over.
The UUCP program is also getting fixes for the fileserver and PALM is
also now working. I will have those fixes and working PALM here as soon
as they get sent to me.
One of these days I will have the Ocean Beach Fido BBS  running on my
MM/1 along with the UUCP that I am running !
And one more item of good news is the 9meg update boards are supposed to 
be in production very soon, maybe as I type this.
The delay on the /T3,/T4 paddle boards has been caused by lack of chips
which are supposed to be available this August.

The Teac FD55B worked great.  I'll keep going with the FD55FGR too, as
it is a dual speed drive (720K/1.2M) type drive....

Well, My I/O board is back from Arkansas.   And, coincidentally, I've
just mailed the order for new I/O boards to be made.   Now the search
for a new board stuffing house is in high gear!   It is nice to be able
to note, also, that 8 megabye upgrade cards will be available within 8
weeks.   Thanks for all your patience and support guys!
