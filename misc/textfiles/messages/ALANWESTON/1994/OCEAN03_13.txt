Dear Warren:
   I have a used Quantum 40 meg Hard Drive with a SCSI 50 pin cable
connection and just next to this is another connector with 16 pins.
This drive has been tried in an MM-1 and powers up ok and tries to
seek,  but will not format.  The only information I have is from the
drive itself.  There is an apple decal with a 40 in the middle, a
quantum barcode strip with Q250  and 74-45004,  a decal on a chip 
with a 1987 date.  I was wondering if anyone had any information on
this drive.
                                    Thanks George

Today I went out and bought a Mouse Systems trackball--it can do both
Mouse Systems packets (which is what Logitech at least used to use, so I 
figured it would work for me) and Microsoft (two-button) flavor at the
throw of a switch, so it sounded like just the thing.
 
It wasn't.  It almost worked, but it had a great aversion to moving up
and down.  I took it back, but decided to ask them to try it on one of
their PClones...and for them it worked.
 
What I eventually found out, after some manual reading, a voltmeter
purchase, and some measuring, is that the trackball wanted +12VDC
+/- 10%, and it was getting 9.56 or 9.95 VDC (one of the lines held high 
measured one, the other the other).  Measurements were made between the
pins and the outer shell (protective ground).
 
So...it sounds like my paddle board isn't putting out the volts that the 
trackball wants.  (It's enough for my Logitech mouse, which probably
wants +5VDC...)  Am I correct in my inference?  Did I measure relative
to the right thing?  If I'm right, what can I do about it?  Advice is
welcome.
