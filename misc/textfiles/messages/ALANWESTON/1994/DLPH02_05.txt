Sure I would be willing to try them out. I have the following system:
Coco 3 512K, 3-360K floppies, Ken-Ton SCSI interface, Fujitsu 75 Meg MFM HD
w/adaptec 4000 controller running it as                 SCSI.
I am proficient at OS9, I have set up RiBBS on the HD but my converted rs232
pak, made from a                        DCModem pak, has a bad RTS line so it wo
n't respond to
users trying to log on.

Computer Shopper is sold in most books stores I believe, or try big
computer stores, that have a magazine sections... it is a large catalog
type magazine.

Sorry, I don't know know how to get ahold of Ken-Ton.. maybe someone else
here will fill in the details...

Hi REVWCP. I see that you have the 2meg coco3. Is it similar the the
Disto 1meg. The pgm that you run with the 1meg needs to know that the
1meg is there. Is this also true with the 2meg? Thks.(g)

The 2 meg is much easier to install, only a few wires to solder.  Of course
Tony designed both.  But I think he did a better job with the two meg board.
 There is the Mega2 that runs in startup.  I forget what module deals with
memory.  Obviously mine doesn't work.  I' m sure someone else can tell you.
With all best wishes

All clock programs should be running at the same time no matter which

Thanks for the info Mark! Looks like a line of text got deleted from
your response. I got "file must be called crontab and placed in the ..."
You were gonna tell me the name of the directory but it got zapped
somehow. So, if you could, one more time!

Joel,

dIOams! Which is not necessarily
> what you want, since it creates more system overhead.

The original problem I had was caused by mixing buffered and non-buffered
output.  It could have been solved by using fflush before any un-buffered
write.  But I had another program that came up this week and that
is of buffered input!  Input via getchar() waas not being received
until the buffer was flushed (or something similar) and it was causing
me major problems with a hot key menu that I wrote.  So nobuff() solves
that problem.  If I have no need of using getchar<> then maybe I can
live with buffered i/o but as it was I needed a quick and easy solution.

I have a few eprom burners left, a few SC-IIs left, a few 2-Meg adapters left,
many 4IN1s and a few COCO 3s. Just ask if you want prices. -Tony.

Yes I would like prices on eprom burners and price and info on the 2-meg
adapters.
What exactly is a 2-meg adapter? A memory upgrade to 2 megs? Also what'7s a
4in1?

From talking to a friend that uses the MS-Dog version of D-Lite I can
also tell you that D-Lite has support for Delphi's Usenet Netynt to
