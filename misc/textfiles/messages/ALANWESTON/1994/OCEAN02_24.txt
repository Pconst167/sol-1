     Hi!  I have a question for anyone who can give me an answer(g)! 
I'm in need of a monitor for my mm/1 and would like to have the specs on 
a NEC multisync 2A.  I have no info on it and would like to know several 
things like:  Dot pitch and scan rates.  Any info will help.  Thanks.

Dear James:
    I am using 60 ns Simm chips,  I started out with 80 ns 1 meg. chips
and had the same problem that you described.  I would load a disk file
and get a CRC error.  With the 60 ns 4 meg simms I can run at 20 mhz ,but
will occasionaly get an error on a file copy, at 21 mhz the computer
will not boot.  I have been using the 16.6 mhz speed as my default
setting and have had no problems.  I would think a 70 ns Simm would be
the best to use if they are the priced less than the 60ns chips. I
don't think the memory chips are the problem with speeds in excess of
19 mhz.

Paul,
  Thanks for that info. I just got back off a business trip to the east
coast. I also recently just got a copy of the protocals for X & Ymodem,
including BATCH mode.

Warren,
 Back homme now. Mike Halland left me a msg on Delphi on how to make the 
SHELL feature work in KTerm. Just as soon as I get it working, then I
can start to work on the next beta of OSKBINK. The next beta will fork a 
process and run a user defined and supplied programm (BBS). Then I will
start on the rewrite of OSKBINK. I plan to try and get the curses
windowing feature to work. At work I have been playing with curses and
now understand it a lot better. Then all that will be needed to be doen
will be to get the mail routines running.

John,
     I already posted in the OS9 echo to you but rereading this reminded 
me of the Kterm problems.  As you know the Ybatch upload wont work but
the Ybatch download will, provided you dont hit enter when setting up on 
a RiBBS system.  Just enter in the names of files wanted and select
protocol, dont hit enter then but go to the Kterm files window and
select receive.  And Viola it will batch download fine.

Ok folks - math 1.7 should be on Ocean Beach BBS soon. (I just uploaded
it).  Sorry about that - I don't use Basic, and C doesn't check the
carry flag.  (What's that, you say?  Check the Microware docs?  Whatever 
for?)  Oh well.  Maybe the third time is the charm.

George,
  yes, your correct. OS/9 will file lock in that case. I do know that ME 
will try and load the whole file at one time, thus may be a quirk in ME
and not in other text editors. Have you tried to use the editor that is
supplied from MW ?? I wondering if it is ME related or system wide
related.

Paul,
  I think , I have already responed to this msg but want to add that you
can  tell KTerm what port to use on the prompt line.
 
     kterm /t3 &
 
  I looked and noticed that I had missed adding 38400 baud to the dial
menu screen. It is now fixed. You can now select 38400 as the baud rate
and save it in the dail parameter.

AHHH, now it is much more clear. I got the specs on XYmodem just before
I went to VA. . From it I should be able to see  t it will take to do
BATCH UPLOAD. Also got a msg from Mike Haaland about doing the shell
mode. Included some code too. Great guy.

Calvin,
    I'll have to give Ocean Beach a call in the next few days to d/l it. 
I can't remember right off hand which EFFO_PD# the EPHEM was in. There was 
like 9  EFFO_pd on a local bbs here #0-8. I am hoping for this one local bbs 
to get in his extra lines for the InterNet connection.

  hello all..
 
  Sigh..yesterday, my MM/1's hard drive decided to stop letting me in.
Sysgo dies upon booting from floppy, stating "can't CHX to /h0/cmds" or
something similar, after printing "Error #246". OSK manuals say error #246
means "device not ready".
  Is there any way I can convince the drive to let me in so I can at least
salvage some recent source code with dEd?
 
 thanks in advance,
  -Russ Magee

John,
    I had used DED to change the default port within KTERM. This way I don't 
have to mess with telling it to use /t3. It works. I used the search function 
in DED to look for "/t" and changed it from there.

Russ,
    Have you tried booting up  with one of the original discs ?  Looks
like you need to change your init module to stay on the floppy cmds
disc.  Try the 3 meg boot disk, I recall that has a hard drive desc. on
it also.

John,
     I got the compiled palm files no problem but when your system died
sending the other file and just locked up I had to disconnect at this
end. I think you were trying UCC.lzh or something.
