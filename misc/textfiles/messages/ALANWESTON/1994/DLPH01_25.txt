CL, it is POSSIBLE to construct an adapter from the schematic. There arte
two problems you may encounter. 1) There are a lot of pins to wire wrap, but it
can be done. Bob Puppo himself wire wrapped the original adapter and used it
for a little more than a year before constructing a board and producing it. 2)
the Motorola matrix
switches may be hard to find in small quantities, as they aren't usually used
by hobbyists.

The little note about the capacitor to use if"Squared D=4013" is trivial. I'm
not sure exactly what it means, not being an engineer myself, but the line it
is used on is the data line from the IBM type keyboard. Some keyboards need the
capacitor, some don'
t. You'll have to construct the adapter without the cap, then if you experience
problems, add it later. A couple people have mentioned that they might work up
a board design. IF someone sends one in, and will certify that it isn't a copy
of the Puppo desig
ned board, I'll print the design and/or where a bare board or kit can be
purchased.

I don't think it is fair to blame Microsoft and Intel for delaying
progress.  I think the real blame lies with all those people who bought
IBM simply because of its reputation - "no one ever got fired for buying
IBM", or maybe the blame lies with IBM itself, for choosing the wrong
processor and operating system.

The whole problem with OS-9 was the fact that the documentation scared off the
users.  Now there are plenty of places to turn for help.  Originally there was
a large void.  This is a problem that Tandy never tried to address with the
CoCo.  They did acknowledge it however with their Tandy 1000 line of computers.
MS-DOS is just as intimidating as OS-9 to a beginner.  There were lots of books
published because of this.  OS-9 never had the following and Tandy never tried
to fix the lack of easy to use documentation.  If they had written manuals for
OS-9 that were similar to the CoCo Basic manuals you would have seen a lot of
OS-9 users earlier on.  With MS-DOS Tandy gave the users DESKMATE....where did
I see that before????.... where the user could just point and click without
having to know how to use a command line.  They trained their personnel to be
able to install disk drives, cards, memory, programs, etc. so that they could
actually support the 1000 line of computers.  Something they could/should have
done with the CoCo but never bothered with.  The CoCo is a much more powerrful
computer than the original Tandy 1000 and it could have made a much bigger
impact on the market than it did IF Tandy would have bothered to market it as
actively as they did the 1000 line.

 I agree Tandy is somewhat at fault and the documentation is a good example.
However, I will always believe that the eventual downfall of the CoCo was
brought on by the CoCo users themselves.
 Since the cost of a CoCo was relatively low in comparison to the rest of
the computer market, Tandy relied alot on software sales to make up the
difference, i.e. OS9/Development system, TSWord/Edit, Home Publisher,
OS9 C Library/Compiler, Multi-Vue etc, as well as MANY others (the list is
quit extensive), which was on the more expensive side of the spectrum.
 The CoCo community as it was/is, did more pirating of this software than
buying leaving Tandy holding the bag.
 With OS9 appearing to be so complicated (and expensive), the average CoCo
user was intimidated (myself included until '89 when I plunged into RiBBS,
got my first CoCo in '83). The fact is, with the same amount of effort, OS9
is no harder to learn than RSDOS.
More?
 Further compounding the problem, OS9 requires a hard drive to reach its full
potential which was at the time VERY expensive. And for telecommunications,
a MPI and RS232 Pak were also needed (more money).
 From a users point of view I consider Tandy's decision a bad one, but from
a buisness point of view it was probably a very wise decision to drop the
CoCo even though it will most likely always be Tandy's best selling home
computer.

The one thing that could have made OS-9 easier to use at that time was
Multi-Vue.  But MV was doomed with system crashes and TANDY never
fixed it.  Some hackers fixed the problem, but it was too late.  MS-DOS
had easy workable interfaces (and more programs as well) that attracted
people that wanted to get something done and who weren't interested
in programming their own applications.d)

 I can't argue with the bad documentation on Tandy's part, but there was/is
and has been for quite sometime 3rd party OS9 step by step documentation.

 Original Tandy 1000? I'd say ANY Tandy 1000. I'll put my OS9 CoCo up against
any 8088 or XT.

Yes, there was third party step by step documentation for OS-9 but it wasn't
marketted by Tandy.  The whole point is that Tandy is the one that didn't ever
market the computer properly.  They never gave an easy user interface to OS-9
(that worked well) and for those reasons it never could compete with the other
machines they sold.  Where would you have gone IF you didn't know of R'bow and
Delphi or some other source of support?  I'll bet there were thousands of CoCos
purchased that never had any support other than the local Rat Shack.  Kind of a
scary scenario, isn't it?

Joel,
   Ok, I guess I'll have to wait till I get that issue.
 I have been trying to figure out how to use that _ss_play, but I can't
make any sense out of what is needed for a header for IFF files. I have
used Ded on some IFF's and I see where the file size & sample rate values
are located but the header calls out for a 48 byte header. What are all
the other bytes used for ?
   I also wonder if it is possible to stop a sound thats playing, before
its finished playing all the data. In the case of a sound that is played
until the button on the mouse is pressed. Once the button is pressed the
sound stops. In other words, how do you interrupt _ss_play, once its
started ?

     Ghostscript
     From: JOHNREED     To: ALL


Ghostscript users:
        I have found the problem with some of the printer drivers
in Ghostscript ver 2.6.1 and I think I fixed it.  I overlooked
a couple "improvements" in the source code that had some `\r'
and `\n' codes in them.  The OSK compilers helpfully translate
both of these to a CR.  Unfortunately, when a programmer puts
in `\r\n' he is looking for CR-LF, not CR-CR.  This is a fairly
common problem in porting things from other machines, and I
shouldn't have missed it, must have been a full moon.

        I thought the problem was even worse than that at first,
when a lack of linefeeds in the Epson ESC/P2 driver output
was called to my attention, I plugged in my Epson with a
long printer cable (10 or 12 feet) that used to work fine
with the 68070.  I got trash.  The 68340 does not like long
printer cables.  Yeah, I know, Mark Griffith and others have
warned about problems with the long cables before, but I was
getting away with it until I put in the faster CPU.
More?

        After getting the epson  ESC/P2 driver working right, I
went through all the drivers and changed all the `\r' codes
to `\n'.  Then, in those cases where there was a `\r\n'
sequence, I made it `\n\l'.  That oughta do it.  The only
drivers I can actually test are the Deskjet 500 and Epson,
but I think the BJ-10 and C-8510 drivers might also have been
affected.  The `\r' by itself is not a problem, its just when
they put in both `\r' and `\n' and expect them to mean different
things.  If you are having trouble with no linefeeds or too many
linefeeds, get the new version - should be there in a few days.

 i don't know how many times i've wished i knew everything. and then later i
 console myself with the thought that knowing everything'd take a lot of fun
 out of just living. "It's not a job. It's an adventure. " but it ain't navy.

Well, it is interesting that the carbon dioxide level is increasing and that
the average global temperature is also rising.  Correlation but not cause-and-
effect (yet).

     UUCP for CoCo
     From: WA2EGP       To: ALL

Hi all.  Just to let you know that the UUCP package from Bob Billson is NOT
vaporware...just flu-ware.  It seems Bob has contracted the latest version of
the flu and has been under the weather (release and version number unknown).
He will finish it up when he is feeling better.  This is the official reason
that is hasn't been released yet.  We have been in communication almost every
day and he asked me to mention the delay.  Hang on guys....its a comin'!

That is precicely why I wired a terminal to my Sun that is right next to my
bed on the "night stand"... When I'm sick, i just reach over and grab the
keyboard.
Also great for when you have the middle of the night brainstorm programming
ideas that
just can't wait til morning...

Funny, now that I have enough working serial ports on the mm/1, I spent Sat.
afternoon stringing  rs232 cabling throughout the house. And, yes, one
destination is bedside. :>
 Several years ago, I had a bedside terminal hooked up to my coco. But do to
the os9/6809's buggy, little used, termcap, it was of little use.

I actually write better code when I'm in a feverish state.  I think it has
something to do with my brain running on overload while sleeping
and having hellish dreams about MS-DOS?  I try to record as much as I can
about a routine before my fever dissappears and I forget everything
I dreamt of.

After spending an hour at the internet I got to some place that was just
one directory away from what I think I wanted but they did not think that
that pirticular directory existed .I would like to know just what BLACK MAJIC
is needed to get this elusive program .
Perhaps a blank disk and a $ would entice someone to help in this matter.
NOTE the $ is only for the time and hassle it takes for addressing the mailer
and such.
please help or at least tell me how to get there.
    thanks.TMF

When using FTP on Delphi, you have to be careful when using "cd" and "get"
to put file/pathnames in quotes, especially if the name has Uppercase
chars, or "/" chars... there may be other special characters that need
quoteing...you can play it safe, buy just always using quotes around
remote file/pathnames.

I d/l'ed a program called BEAV (Binary Editor And Viewer) but I didn't get the
source.  I can't find it in the database (my vision must be going) and I
thought I got it here.  Has anybody seen this beast here or on another BBS?
I'm beginning to think Rod (of Twilight Zone fame) is a device on my SCSI bus
