Thanks Steve.  I'm definately on teh Standard billing plan, because there is no
way I can afford $12.80+$1.70 surcharge (tymnet) per hour!

$4.80+$1.70 an hour is bad enough :)

Sb: #OS-9 Password File
Fm: Mike Fahy 74656,2340
To: All

Having ressurected my Coco II with all the trimmings from my
attic into my den and with a little prodding from my son, I have
it up and running OS-9 Level 1.02.  Surprising how my memory has
held up over the last 11 years.  But, my OS-9 operating system
manuals disappeared at some point and I need a little help with
some rough edges.

My main problem is the parameters in the /DO/SYS/PASSWORD file.
After stringing a few wires, we have been successful getting a 3
user system going. The two terminals are a R.S. Model III which
also got dragged down from the attic and a 486 PC in my office
downstairs (when I'm not hacking I consult in the real world -
I know, ugh!, but its a living).

Anyway, after we login from the terminals, we don't have much
access to the system and a bunch of random CHD's and CHX's
sometimes yield something and sometimes don't.

What are the various parameters in the PASSWORD file?  Seems the
first one is either blank or a user name, then a comma or two,
then a number 0, 1, 2, or 3, then maybe /DO/CMDS, a couple more
comma's and a single . within two of the commas.

If someone would explain to me each field in this file, my son
(at the ripe old age of 10) would really have something going.

Many thanks for the help . .

The password fields (from my OSK manuals, but I think they are the same on
level II) are:

        USER NAME,
        PASSWORD,
        USER ID NUMBER,
        INITIAL PROCESS PRIORITY,
        INITIAL EXEC DIRECTORY,
        INITIAL DATA DIRECTORY,
        INITIAL PROGRAM

Each field is separated by a comma.

The single dot you see in your file is a reference to the current data or exec
directory.

A typical line might be:

        Bob,secret,1,128,.,.,shell

Shout if you need more help.

Bob,
Sorry for this "cold call", but I wanted to find out if you knew anyone with
OS/9 internals/porting/application development expertise that would be
interested in taking up a 6 month - 1 year assignment working on a leading edge
project with a Fortune 100 company. I am looking for 2 Consultants that have
one or more of the above skill sets. Any feedback you can give me would be
greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Partha,

Probably lots of folks on this forum reading your message. Hopefully one will
be interested and qualified. Sounds like a tempting enough assignment...would
the candidate have to move to NY?
