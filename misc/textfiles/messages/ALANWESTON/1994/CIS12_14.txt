Hi David,

Yes, OS-9 is used in CD-i players.  At first, only Microware (the makers of
OS-9) made dev systems for it, but now there are several good ones from other
vendors.  Your best bet is to "go cdi" or "go multimedia" (same place) and ask
about them in the CD-i section.

best, kev

Sb: small os9 systems
Fm: Doug Farrell 76701,16

I hate to admit this, but here goes - I used to be a CoCo OS9er back a few
years ago, but now I'm an IBM'er.  Sorry, but that's where my job went.
Anyway, I always liked OS9 on the 6809 and am considering a side project that
might be right in line for it.
I have two questions:
1 - Does anyone know of a small 6809 based embedded controller that would be
OS9 compatible?  Price is also a consideration here.
2 - Is there a C/Assembler cross compiler to do development to the above device
that would be hosted on an IBM pc clone?
Any help would be most appreciated.
Thanks,
Doug Farrell

Is there anyone out there (there probably are!), who can help me with at little
devicedriver problem.

I want to call one device driver from another... but how?

I have a timer device which executes a IRQ every 1 ms., this routine should
call two other devicedrivers to set some IO-ports, is this possible?

Bye bye

Ronan,

I wrote an EEPROM writer a while back.  I don't have my source handy (I'm out
in the field doing an installation), but I *think* I made it a system state
program and simply shut off interrupts during the writes (nasty, but what else
can you do?).

To: All

I have downloaded the OS9MAX demo from this forum and like what I see, but does
anybody know of any other way to read OS/9 diskettes on a PC running MS-DOS? Is
there an American distributor of OS9MAX? Is there any reason I should be leary
of purchasing direct to Germany?

TIA,
David

David,

I'm looking for a OS9000 driver for a 3COM Etherlink 3 ethernet card.  Do you
know if one exists and where I might find it?

Thanks for your help.

PowerBasic for OS9/68000 has a new name.

    CDL Basic for OS9/68000

It was brought to our attention that the name PowerBasic was in use in the PC
world and this confused many people. In order to avoid confusion (and avoid
spending far too much time with lawyers) we decided to change the name. Hope
this doesn't confuse too many people.

Frank


PS CDL Basic comes from 'Computer Design Labs', the creators of the compiler.

Please delete the files that refer to PowerBasic in dl12. I will upload new
files using the new name CDL Basic.

Thanks
