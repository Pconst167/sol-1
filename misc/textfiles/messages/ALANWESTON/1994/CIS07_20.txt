Fm: keith bauer 71102,317
To: all

First off let me state that this "problem" is not a big deal. It is just one of
those things that should work but doesn't. I have a MM/1 with a Maxtor 7213SR
hard drive. I formally had a Seagate ST157N. When I had the Seagate I was able
to boot from the hard drive without any problem. Now that I have the Maxtor it
must tries anywhere from 5 to 10 times to boot before it does. This is when it
is up and running and I just press reset. It is worst when it is a cold boot. I
have a blank formatted disk in the drive like I should. It seems to me that I
saw a message a while ago from someone who had this same make of drive that
found a fix to the problem. If so please let me know what you did.

I'm surprised it is even booting at all. I have two 7213S's and when I upgraded
to a 340 and it wouldn't boot I spent quite some time on the telephone with
Kevin Pease. His last comment on the matter was that the ROM boot code was
trying to do multi sector IO and the drive did not support it (or vice versa, I
don't remember which). Pease actually suggested getting a smallish Connor just
to boot from!! His only other suggestion was to send him my second drive so he
could debug the boot code on his system with the drive. I told him I would be
willing to do without a second hard drive for up to a month and offered to send
it to him, but at the time (shortly after last year's ATL fest) he was too busy
to work on it. I haven't spoken to him since, and I am still having to boot
from a floppy.

Mine doesn't...however, if I connect a digitial probe to the scsi activity line

What version of the Ultra C compiler are you using?  Microware sells a DOS (not
OS/2) hosted version of the Ultra C cross compiler.  The 1.2 version of Ultra C
(due out soon) generates very efficient code vis a vis compared to GCC, Ultra C
1.1 and C 3.2 compilers.

You may want to check your options and upgrade to the 1.2 version of Ultra C
when it is available.

To: all

I am having a problem running two modems on the two high speed ports on the
MM/1.  I have asked around and I have been told that it is a problem with the
driver.

The problem I am having is that when both modems are set to answer the line,
the CD is not detected, and if someone hangs up, the signal of change of CD
does not
get sent.

When only one modem is configured and set up, all works fine.

I was told that Carl Kreider has the source for the serial drivers for OSk 2.4?
Is there any way the drivers can be reworked?

Also, another thing I have noticed is that the ports miss characters during
hard disk I/O.  I have played around with the maxcount.  I think the problem
may be with the DMA hardware.  Any suggestions?

Well, partly driver, and partly hardware.  The two ports share a common
interrupt line.  Apparently it would take some gymnastics in the driver to be
able to ensure that both interrupts are recognized.

 > Also, another thing I have noticed is that the ports miss characters
 > during hard disk I/O.  I have played around with the maxcount.  I think
 > the problem may be with the DMA hardware.  Any suggestions?

The default maxcount (maxcount=65535) allows a _fast_ harddrive to monopolize
the DMA bus for too long.  For example, if the harddrive is able to support a
throughput of about 1.8 Mbytes/sec, the system DMA has priority for about 36.4
mSec!  (About 35 characters at 9600 bps.) Reducing maxcount is mandatory for
proper serial port operation. Small reductions (e.g., to 16K) won't eliminate
the problem.  Mine is currently set for maxcount=2048.

BTW, the MM/1a (i.e., with accelerator board / 68340) has different DMA
mechanisms.  The above is for the 68070.

The other thing to watch for on the HS serial ports is that the baud rates
selected are compatible. Don't have the list right now...but you can't do
things like set one for 19.2 and the other for 38.4. You can do 9600 and 19.2,
or 9600 and 38.4, or both 38.4, etc. If it isn't here, I could type up the data
from the 68681 data sheet and post it here.

Can someone please advise me on transferring text files from a Color Computer
III running OS9 level 2 to a Mac? I do not have a modem for the Coco III, and
am hoping that i can connect through the serial port somehow. Or,  if there is
some way that an IBM can read the files, I could transfer them to the Mac. Can
anyone help??- please e-mail!

Sb: #New SYSGO for MM/1
Fm: Eric Levinson 74471,1241
To: all

I recently downloaded the new sysgo replacement for the MM/1.

When I created a new boot disk and booted all went fine.

I created a Startup.2 file and rebooted with the shift key down..

The startup.2 file gets executed then the following happens.  It displays

Error #000:216

it then waits about 6 seconds, clears the screen and displays the same message.
This only happens on the /term device.  All the other devices works fine.

Any ideas?

Please write here or eric_levinson@rcisnet.org

Thanks

That's a bad path, if I recall... Perhaps you need to use a fully qualified
pathname (i.e. /dd/cmds/mycommand /dd/my_scriptfile).

Bad path?  I am not using any paths in my startup file.  Just an echo command:

echo THIS IS STARUP.2

Mmmmm.... in the SYSGO, has /dd/cmds been CHX'd to (made the execution
directory)? Is the SHELL in that directory? Is it in memory? Your problem is
likely in one of these areas.

Yea, SHELL is in /dd/cmds.

If my STARTUP is:

echo STARTUP

and my STARUP.2 is

echo STARUP.2

both those should run with no problems, but the problem only happens on the
latter.  The former works fine!

Eric,

I installed sysgo edition 9 over the weekend and it seems to be working for me.
I did reassemble it, because the binary included in the archive forks login
instead of shell, and does not have the reboot feature enabled.  I also
stumbled across a bug caused by alignment, this might be causing your 216 error
*if* you reassembled sysgo with the option to fork shell.  The binary that's
included does not have this problem.  To fix the alignment problem, find the
second line labeled "MainPrm", the one with the comment starting "[StG]-05",
and add the following line before it:

    dc.l 0

This will align the label on a word boundary.  If MainPrm is not on a word
boundary, then the "dc.l 8" will be aligned by the assembler, adding an extra
null byte.

What? Don't like to use the "align" pseudo-op? :-)

I'll try reassembling the program and see if the alignment fixes the problem.
Oh, I will also set it to run shell instead of login.

What is this about a shift key during boot? What file are we taking about...
the latest I have one by STG which is labeled edition #7 and a #104 by Roy
Ducus. Point me in the right direction and I'll dl it and see what goes <g>.

Bob,

Joel Hegberg brought sysgo up to edition 9, which allows for an alternate
startup file by holding down the shift key.  This is only for OSK machines that
support KWindows.  Edition 8 (Tim Kientzle) cleaned up and modularized the code
for easier modification, as well as adding the option to fork login rather than
shell.  I guess it hasn't made it to CIS, yet, I'll go ahead an upload it if
someone else hasn't already beaten me to it.

Yes, please upload the sysgo here. I was aware of the later version of
kwsaver...but no one has taken pity on a poor, lonely, OSKer living in the
remote mountains of British Columbia--so I don't have it yet.

Since you uploaded kwsaver, I thought I'd let you know that Joel came out with
a version 2.0, do you have it yet? Are you using it? Other than taking up a
window, it seems to work fairly well.

I am trying to set up a shell script to take input from the keyboard.

On the COCO, the following would work:

setime </1

On the MM/1, this does not work.  I looked over the grey MM/1 OSK manuals, but
the shell section says to use </term.  This is okay, but it will only work on
/term.  Is there a way to specify the keyboard as a device?

Bob,
  I have been playing around with your mm2hp program, and have been trying
to get something like it working for my 550c.
  I don't know if you are still interested in it, but I can tell you why the
screens are truncated on the right side. It appears that the HP printers are
bit based and not byte based. In other words, if you are trying to print out
a 320 x 208 screen, each line you send is 320 bytes, or 2560 bits.
  On a 8 1/2 x 11 sheet, the printer can only print 8 inches across, and at
300 dpi, it can only print 2400 dots across those 8 inches. So on a 320 horz.
screen, it will only print 300 bytes of the 320 on the line. The same problem
shows up more pronounced when you print out a 640 horz. screen. More than
half of it will be truncated.
  So it looks like the only way to print entire screens, is to do some bit
packing. If you converted each screen byte to 7 bits, and packed them into
280 bytes, for a total of 2240 bits, you would get a 7.46 inch wide print out
of a 320 screen. On the 640 screens, you would need to represent each screen
byte with 3 bits, packed into 240 bytes, for a total of 1920 bits, which
would give a 6.4 inch print out of a 640 screen.
  I wish the manuals that I got from HP would have been more informative, and
clearer on the bit verses byte for raster graphics, it would have saved me
a lot of wasted time. <g>
  Now I just have to come up with a good routine for packing bytes into bits.

Hi Larry. Glad someone is playing with the mm2hp program. I am still interested
in it...just don't have the time <g>.

You are completely correct that the program is trying to send more dots than
the printer can handle. However, I don't think that the answer is to convert 8
bits to 7, etc. Remember, each byte of data is just a bit stream...and the bits
represent pixels. On a 256 color screen each byte represents one pixel; on a 16
color 4 bits are 1 pixel. So what really needs to be done is to take each pixel
(4 or 8 bits) and convert that to a grey scale (or even a color value if you
are using a color ink jet printer). It sort of works by just dumping the raster
image...but it is not the _correct_ way to do it. I really just wrote the
program to see how easy it would be to send raster data to the printer.

I really hope you persist and get some good screen dumps working!

   Bob,
       You are right that the pixels will need to be converted to a grey
   scale. Each screen byte would be changed to a 7 bit pattern, something
   like the following: ( assuming 256 color pixel)

     pixel value         7 6 5 4 3 2 1

       0 - 31            2 2 2 2 2 2 2

      32 - 63            2 2 2   2 2 2           2 = black

      64 - 95            2 2   2 2   2             = white

      96 - 127           2   2   2   2

     128 - 159             2   2   2  

     160 - 191               2   2    

     192 - 223                 2      

     224 - 255                        

     Then these 7 bit values would be packed back into 8 bit bytes to be
   sent to the printer.

       bytes to be set to printer
      byte 1             byte 2             byte 3             byte 4
  8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1    8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1    8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1    8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

 |----- 1------|------ 2 -------|------- 3 ------|------- 4 ------|
   each pixel is represented by 7 bits

   My biggest problem at this point is the working with bits in C, I'm
 real shaky with C as it is, without doing this fancy stuff. <g>

   I'll let you know if I get anywhere with this

Seems you are well on the way. I would suggest the following:

1. Have a lookup table to convert the pixel values to the 7bit values.

2. Just send the 7bits out to a bit-stream function...this function would then
take care of rotating bits into bytes. Ummm, guess this is the tough function
for you. Let's see...you'd have to have a static buffer in the function which
would get filled up by rotating the 7bit values into it. Guess you'll just have
to bone up on the bit operators in C. Shout if you need help here!
