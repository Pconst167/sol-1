Hey,
I had George Ganoe recommend that I check this forum out. I though it might be
nice to interact with a sysop who could explain and make come recomendations to
me about the use of a navigator program. Unlike some of the other forums, I was
unable to find a list of sysops so I could track one down myself, so I am
playing go fish.
Hope to hear from someone

I'm aware of only one true navigator program that runs under OS9 and that's
Bill Dickhaus's InfoXpress. I use it all the time and it's a dandy!

Leave mail for Mark Griffith [76070,41] for details on ordering.

Steve,
thanks for answering my query. I have sent a message to Mark Grioffith, as you
suggested. I thought OS-9 was a navigator program. What then is OS-9? Or
exactly what is this forum about?

OS-9 is a multi-user/mutil-tasking operating system developed by Microware
Corporation.

This forum's purpose is to support the users of OS-9 on the various computer
platforms it run on. One of the more popular computers to support the OS9
operating system is the Tandy Color Computer.

I got your name from the sysop's list. I need some guidance through this fourm.
Can you tell me about os-9, what it can do or not do? What hardware I might
need? How to get started..... you know all the standard stuff. Also fill me in
on what services the forum can provide me. Your help would be most appreciated.

Gee, that's a tal order.  OS-9 is an operating system much like Unix except it
is much smaller and modular.  OS-9 is mostly used for industrial control
applications and is normally burned in a ROM along with the application
software.  However, it makes a real good hobbyist OS which is the main reason
for this forum, to support OS-9 users.

The reason OS-9 is attractive to the industrial control people is because it is
modular, easily ROMed and also for it's real-time capabilities.

Hardware is another matter.  OS-9 was originally written for the Motorola CPU
series (6809, 68000, 68020 etc). but is now available for the Intel CPUs as
OS-9000.  There are a number of OS-9 machines around.  If you are really
looking for one, let us know here and the name of a few vendors can be
provided.

Let me know if you have any more questions.  You can just post yours to the
general forum members as there are more people out there that can answer you
questions better than I.

Microware used to offer a support area (tho not a forum) on CompuServe several
years ago, but has since discontinued it.

There has been some discussion on OS9000 here and several members do use it.
There are a couple of OS9000 specific files in our libraries as well. (use a
keyword seach on OS9000)

Ask your questions!  I'm sure someone will jump in with some advice.

Dear Gene: I saw your posting.  My name is Brother Jeremy.  I am a member of a
small religous order called the Community of St. Joseph the Worker.  We have
three COCO3's in the monastery so any additional hardware would be usefull in
case of a disaster. (Like blowing one up, which I did a few months back).
However that is not a pressing need.  I would however, be interested in
Sculptor. We do not currently have a non=profit tax status, so I would not be
able to offer you any tax credits for a donation.  Moreover, since you do have
a cash outlay involved, perhaps we could negotiate something.  I will be away
this weekend at the COCOFEST in Chicago, but I will get back to you next week.
With all best wishes, Brother Jeremy, CSJW OS9 User's Group Treasurer

A GNU emacs is available on many systems not sure about OS-9.  The micro emacs
version 3.11 is much the same and is available for OS-9.  Microware distributes
something called umacs which is a somewhat stripped down emacs.  All quite
similar on the surface however, and certainly familar to anyone familiar with
the emacs type editors.

Margaret,
        I suspect that your friend is looking for "EMACS" - a very good text
editor.  "GNU-EMACS" is a version of that program by the GNU/FSF folks.  There
is source code for a version of EMACS (although not the most recent version) in
the "TOPS" uploads in lib-12 -- I think it is on disk #7, but you probably
should check the index first.  (one of the uploads is an index to the rest --
they are huge).  Also, try your search again with EMACS as the key.

Dear Tony,

There is not necessarily any need to worry about a device that says that it
needs 2 stop bits. The stop bits on an RS232 serial stream only exist to let
the hardware reset itself, and so anything that requires 2 stop bits is
probably an old slow peice of kit. It is however still possible.

HI Mark,
I was using this to keep records for a non-profit historical society.  I kept a
clone of the equipment as a backup.  I would like to get something out of it to
plow back into the society, since they reimbursed me for about 1/3 of my
original equipment expense a few years back.  That bought a b/w laser printer
for the newsletter.
I now have a couple of PCs of my own and run under windows and AmiPro.
Had to get off OS9 because of compatibility problems.  I would really like to
see this equipmet go to a user's group or a non-profit group that can use it
well. -Gene

I have just uploaded a port for the `gnuplot' program for the MM/1 (and other
OSK machines, I hope).

The latest version I have seen is 3.5.  This port is for version 3.2.

It is based on an OSK port by Chris Thewalt.  I changed a few things that the
MM/1 complained about and added a Kwindows display.  See docs for copyright and
distribution info.

Although it is called "gnuplot", and is distributed with other GNU software, it
is not GNU/FSF material.  It IS copyrighted, and freely distributable.  Again,
see docs for complete information.

Using simple commands, gnuplot will plot anything from a simple line on a chart
to a complex 3D surface.  Output can be directed to any one of several printer
types or to a Postscript or Latex file (or device).

Even if you have no practical use for it, it is fun to watch it work.

will stall in a wait state with the ftp script file and output file left open.
if i kill the ftp process i recover from the lock but can loose data in the
