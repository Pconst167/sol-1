Maybe Boisy is upset because the IRS didn't withhold as much this year as last
and now he has a bigger tax bill to pay, or he isn't getting as much back
and it just looks to him that he paid more... In reality, I believe
only 1.2% of the population actually had to pay higher taxes, aand they were
in the over 180K/year income bracket...  IF Microware is paying Boisy that
much, he has no right to complain! 8-)

Since this is off-topic, I'll keep it short and one-shot only: the one
that come to mind are the gasoline tax.  Would the absence of the promised
middle-class tax cut count as a new tax, or an old one?

The price of gas where I live did not go up noticibly when the tax when
into effect. It went up on the day the tax went in. Later the local
stations had a price war and after they settled down, they were less than
what the old price plus the tax added was.

And even if the entire tax did get applied and stuck there for gas in
your area, the increase that Boisy would have to pay would be a lot less
that most others, unless he commutes more than 30 or so miles one way
to work 5 days a week.

Counting the absense of a "promised" middle-class tax cut being counted
as a new tax (or even an old tax) is really applying Washingtonesqe
accounting to the max, don't you think? Besides, Clinton said he would
like to give the middle class a tax cut, but his expectations at the
time of what the projected deficit was going to be for the year were
a lot lower than they eventually turned out to be.

I'd sure be interested in seeing that info on monitors for the mm1.
I'm currently using a Mag 8cm515. Satisfactory, but loose several
lines in overscan 90X30 and no adjustment available. Mostly I wish
we'd get support for VGA as I understand the hardware can do 35

While the lowercase "a" taking up 6K doesn't necessarily make OS-9 shine, it

And remember, Boisy, while a Word 6 document which only has the character "a"
in it is 6K, then a Word 6 document with the characters "ab" is probably
just 6K + 1.

I recently bought a SCII with the 4-n-1 and I'm have some troubles using the
RS232
The controller works great and I have done the hardware IRQ hack to the MPI so
I can
use my Tandy RS232 and the Disto RS232....only problem is..it doesnt work.
The Disto...setup for the new address and the Tandy set at default dont seem to
interfere with each other BUT if I use a terminal program and while online with
the
Disto I drop to a window for some purpose...the whole sytem locks and I have
to RE-Boot...I havent tried using the Disto rs232 without the Tandy in the MPI.
I am told that it is possible to call from one to the other without troubles.
Has anyone got any Ideas?

 I don't have GCC so I can't check but I did post the source code I used so
 someone could check if they want to.  Maybe they will be kind enough to post
 the results here for the rest of use to see.  Bill Shepard of Microware sent
 me a message about some tests done.  In part:

    ...Ultra C has benchmarked as the fastest 68K compiler on the market, bar
    none (speed of code generated, not time to generate the code).  There are
    at least seven other commerical compilers plus GCC which benchmarks show
    we are faster than, in most cases by at least 50% (as measured by
    Dhrystones), and in more extensive benchmarking against GCC V2.4 we beat
    it in every standardized test we could find.  Similarly, the 80x86
    version has proven to be 40% faster than Microsoft and Borland and very,
    very close to Watcom.


 All I can say for sure is:  UCC 1.1.2 generated code is faster than 3.2
 everywhere I've used it.

 I can say that the bugs I knew about have been fixed in 1.1.2 and all
 reports I've recieved so far are that it's pretty good.  I haven't made much
 use of it yet because I don't have a lot of free space on my hard drives
 (2X40 Meg).  I bought a 340 meg drive today so I'll be able to play with UCC
 more when I have more storage space.

     MM/1 Sound
     From: BOISY        To: JOHNBAER

Hi John,

While in Babbage's (a software/hardware store in the local mall) this
afternoon looking for a mouse, I ran across the ideal MM/1 speaker console.
It's called the S3 Under Monitor Speaker System made by Addison Tech.
It's 13" x 11" and over 3" high and sits under your monitor.

On the left and right side are two built in tweeters and on the underside
is a woofer for bass.  The front panel has volume, tone, balance and
mixer knobs as well as a headphone jack and power button.

The back has connections for two external 4 or 8 ohm speakers, and
has two stereo inputs (A and B).  Using the mixer knob, you can mix
in two separate sound sources.  I have my MM/1's stereo out connected
to L & R input A.  To sample sound, all that's needed is a connector
from the headphone jack on the front to the MM/1's stereo input.  One
could attach a microphone or other line level signal to input B, then
sample that source right into the MM/1.

My monitor fits great on it, although the monitor stand overlaps a bit on
both sides and the back.  The unit also has non-skid rubber feet and
is magnetically shielded to prevent interference with the monitor.  It came
with a 1/8" stereo to dual RCA cable and can safely support up to a 50
pound monitor.

It complements my MM/1 nicely since it's the same color as my computer
case.  Plus, it can double for an amplifier.  Cool stuff!

Terry, that's why it costs 43 cents to mail a letter in Canada.  It
actually only costs 25 cents to get it to the destination.  The rest is
to cover storage charges.

   Great reply!   Storage charges,, I hadn't thought of that.
  Last night we short cut it a bit.   Giving some to Ma Bell.
  Chris needed th Doc files,,, so I just uploaded to him.  We want to have
 this ready for the Fest.  And don't have a lot of time for week ana half
 sends.   I am really impressed with what Chris (Dekker) has done with this
 hmoe management system.
  for starters,,, He places an "INSTALL" program,, which both configures
 to your system,, and eleminates the need foro the non-OSer to learn how to,,
 or follow a long list of command structure; to install it with a system
 disk.   (The way a program should be written)
  The finacial part,, is (shrug) better then my 7 years of upgrading (in RSDOS)
 has achieved; with more features.  The Mailer base,, is the best I've seen.
  Can be used for aunt Martha's Christ card list,,, a rollodex file,, of
 a publishers data base.  With expiration dates.
  This shouold be a $49.95 package,, but of course foro CoCo will be much less.

Til then,,, Terry Simons

Look right here in the database under telecom programs.  Search for scribe
and scribe4.0 from 1992 will appear.  It's too old to be under the new
arrivals...probably why you missed it?

I dunno about that definitive source stuff! (grin)

The drivers I have will work on any OSK system that uses Carl's scsi_mm1d
manager.   So, that pretty much means the MM/1 only.  This is because of
the type of SCSI chip the MM/1 uses (the WD 33C93A).

     Automaticc archive converter needed
     From: MDALENE      To: ALL

    I remember some time ago asking if there was an automatic archive
conversion utility that could convert any archive to any type
automatically. On My old ibm when I had one, I used to use a tool
called zzap. It converted archives based on the information that I
provided in a file called zzap.dat. Meaning if an archiver exsisted
for a specific extension, it would know what to do with it. I used to
use this program automatically when my BBS was running on my XT to
automatically convert archives on the fly as an event. I use LHA 2.11
both on my IBM and the Coco 3. Since I no longer have an IBM
compatible. I no longer have ZZAP. Of course two problems with zzap.
    1. it could not do AR files as there was no official AR program
for os9 files at the time I used to run my bbs system
    2. It does not know the difference from LHA 2.11 or the LZH
bastardization that we have lurking around

    The third problem which I must clearly say, IT DOES NOT EXSIST on
the COCO! I would Kill for a ZZAP processor system for my coco! I am
phasing out AR and guess what? I have to process over 5,000 .AR
files! Now if there was a time I needed a robot batch file converter
system.... It is now!
    ZZAP could convert any archive to any other archive type. For a
short time I was using PKUNZIP 2.04G and converting to pkzip 1.10. It
had seperate statements in zzap.dat for archiving and dearchiving
tools. It did Nested archives quick and painlessly. it did archives
that created directories just as easily making the sub directories
into archives of the specified type.
    I used it to covert from Zip to Zip. ZIP to PKARC. Zip to Zoo,
Zip to LBR (CP/M type systems use LBR archives, I was a CP/M
Repository and had 8" drives to read H47 CP/M disks on the system as
well as for DOS usage). The simple fact was it could convert anything
to anything providing you had those archivers/dearchivers installed
on your system!
    I know I can be cruel at times with tough demands but I beg of
any one who has the time to desigh such a beast! Oh yeah I know how
to get around AR's miserable files like this
..../cmds/pain_in_the_side
where it would transverse your tree 4 times? Heres the fun trick
using ded.
lets see your workspace is /dd/test
go into ded from the root of /dd and type
ded test
Notice where the .. points (2e ae for those who do know know abut the
high bit setting) on my 10 meg second HD the 2e Ae pointed to 15 as a
LSN. and AE pointed to 1D (empty work drive thats why things are so
clean). Change the LSN in the 2E AE entry to 1D and write out
    cd into /dd/test and try to cd out with ..
like this cd ..
you will be stuck in /dd/test! No matter how many periods you stack
on that line!
you can return to the root by typing chd /dd and it will work fine.
Deleteing your test directory with DELDIR will choak though. to do
that you have to edit your /dd/test directory to return the 2E AE to
point back to the root entry. then deldir would work ok.
    I am only mentioning this so that people who get those noxious AR
files can convert them without hunting in their cmds directory for
the pieces! It would make the CMDS directory in /dd/TEST! That may be
a nessary evil for the processor btw.
    OH yeah about ZZAP.dat you not only supplied the working
directory you could supply a directory called BADPATH= your place for
bad archives as well as if you wanted virus scanning. To do the
actual conversion. you supplied filename pathlists on the command
line like this
zzap d:\dloads\*.*
zzap would determine what archives were what in the d:\dloads
directory automatically based on what archive extensions where listed
in zzap.dat This line was usually stuck in the dos environment uless
you were in the directory zzap lived.. for us the /dd/sys directory
for zzap.dat would suffice. It would automatically convert the
archives and would automaticaly delete the old archives unless you
specified otherwise. It checked for nested archives and archives that
had sub directory entries. It did these conversions in the directory
you specified in zzap.dat.
    Now I gave you some info. Will one of you great hackers create
one? ZZAP (the title) is copyrighted but maybe since it is shareware
you can find the author and ask permission to port it.

     PGP for OSK?

Has anyone ported PGP to OSK?  I just made a first stab at compiling it
(using gcc 2.5.6), but although I got everything to compile and link, it
does not seem to work.  Rather than re-invent the wheel, I thought I might
ask around and see if someone else has built a working version.

     Chess
     From: ILLUSIONIST  To: ALL

I have not seen a good chess program anywhere for OS-9, I was wondering
if one exists and where I can get it, I doubt one exits for the CoCo, but
I would be willing to up to $50 for a good chess game for the coco, of
course I would enjoy nice looking graphics on it, but I wouldnt want it
"overly done" 3d-like boxes and such are too slow on the CoCo, esp when
downloading, and that is when I do 60% of my CoCo gameing when I am
either transferring large files with my friends, or to my other systems
(or when delphi slows down a bit), I have tried out the free version
in the databases here.. the computers game is terrible and there are too
many bugs.... :(

Anyone know of a chess game out there (text based is fine) if there isnt
I might write a text based game, as I am not all that good at fancy graphics
(when graphics come to art I flunk, if the graphics are going by mathematics
I do alright :) )

thanks for any info..
