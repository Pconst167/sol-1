No, Makr, the problem is most definately a problem with the hardware,
specifically, the brain dead 6551. I spent almost 2 months diagnosing this
problem back about 2 or 3 years ago, and several hunderd $$$ in phone bills.

Hi Ken..
   Will your scsi47.ar drivers support more than 2 'N' series hard drives
on a disto scII/2-in-1 board or do I need another driver to get more than
2 hard drives. Currently I have a ST296N and a ST157N on-line and would
like to add 2 more ST157N's to the system.. I need the drive space!!!

Hi, Nelson -

Sorry, but scsi47.ar was configured to handle a maximum of 2 drives.

I am not positive, but I believe that Matt Thompson's SCSISYS driver
will handle up to 7 drives.  There is a shareware version here in the
database, but I suggest that you order the registered version from
Northern Xposure, as it is faster, supports a cache, and includes a
6309 version.

Well, I disagree with you.  I don't doubt that the 6551 is not the best
serial ACIA on the market, but it's limitations have nothing to do with
the speed of the data flow.

Only 2 huh??? bummer, trying to get around re-formatting!!! No better joy than
re-installing 127meg of data from floppy!  :) Yeah, I DL'd the version of
scsi System 10 from here to look at the docs and am probably gonna go to
I think he is up to ver 2.2 now but after the fest as I am working on some-
thing and dont really have the time to 'play' with drivers between now and
May 20.. In the docs to Matt's drivers he said that it was configured to
max out at 4 drives but hey, that is twice what I have now!
Thanx and have a fun one...

Matt's driver will also work using 256-byte sectors.  You should be able
to install it and suitable descriptors as a direct plug-in replacement
for scsi47.  (As far as I know...)

All it should take is building a new bootfile -- give it a try.

You can install and format your new (third) drive, copy the files from
one of your old drives over, reformat that one, restore from the third
drive, etc.  Should be "relatively" fast and painless.  You should be
able to continue using your system (cautiously -- don't change or move
any files that are subject to the backup/restore process, of course.).
Possibly an overnight job for "arc" or "dsave".  A secondary benefit is
that your old drive will end up being de-fragmented in the process.

More?
Alternatively, you could build a bootfile containing both Matt's driver
and scsi47 (but keeping the descriptor/harddrive names distinct), and
have the two co-exist during your transfer process.  (Though I really
don't think this will be necessary.)

Good luck... / Ken

Good ideas! I have a couple more ST157N's that I am considering adding to
the system. With the BBS on-line, a workstation wired in, 3 network mailers
running continuously, and me programming in yet another shell, this poor
ole machine is pretty stressed... If I can get 3 to 4 HD's up and running
correctly, I can allocate a mailer to each of a couple drives, my workstation
to another and the BBS to another and speed up the head seek situation as now
all of these are running off 2 HD's and the heads kinda keep busy finding data
at certain times of the day.. :)  Idealy, I would like to have 1 'main' process
running per drive and split the load up. Should be a tad faster(I hope!)
Thanx for the info/idea's...

I have no idea where to get any COMM 4 boards.  I'd love to get another myself.
I have a '486 null modemed and a terminal as well as two modems on the BBS.  I
wish the 14,400 modem could work at anything over 14,400 reliablely.  It is a
shame that the CoCo is stuck with the serial port (s) that are so CPU
intensive that they can't work well under OS-9.

Paul,

  If I remember correctly, you had CTS switched to DSR in an attempt to
bypass the CTS bug. I haven't seen your code changes for this, so I'm guessing
a bit.

  Gene Haskett also tried out the DSR-CTS swap, and had serious problems with
lost data at 9600. The data loss was not caused by the coco missing chars, it
was caused by the coco sometimes ignoring a flow off request. Gene spent an
excessive amount of time watching the signals with a scope looking for a
hardware problem when it finally dawned on us that it was software. With the
evidence in hand, it didn't take to long to find the gaping logic hole tha
could cause a missed DSR transition.

  So, in your testings, did you find this hole in the write routine? And if
so, did you come up with an elegant fix for it (right know, I just direct
hit the hardware)?

1. The good news:  I found gcc ver 2.5.6 for OSK on cabrales -- now its
chestnut.cs.wisc.edu.

2. The bad news: It crashes with source that compiles OK with ver 1.42
on my MM/1a.  (I was compiling Ghostscript).  Someone on CIS (I think it
was Bob Van der Poel, but can't remember for sure) said he had the

stuff in it. Might not be too hard to re-compile it to run on this MM/1a,
but it's a bigger project than I want to try.

B & B does some weird things with the software!

I had a sim problem with my setup,now it works fine.....mine boots up and if
the H/D is flacky or the Drive is not there it jumps to the Boot disk instead!
one thing can louse one up is the CC3go and GrfDrv.....
and of course SHELL......
CC3go does NOT need to be in the BOOT file it will run happy in the ROOT of
the disk/H/D....SHELL and GRFDRV....MUST be in the Cmds file......
biggest cause of the dreaded OS-9 failed ......My BOOT disk has the above
in it.....CC3go takes up space in the BOOT file that can be used!not needed to
be moved unless you are finding the System 64k area fulling up
CLUE to this is NOT being able to Format a disk....
The Format command takes 10k space from the System area,and if it,s not there
no format!.......removing the CC3go file fixes THIS problem,but adds another
file one MUST remember to include,when making a boot disk!

Hi Dennis

It just might be that my system is gettin old. Close to ten years now. I
reinstalled shell+ to the system and rechecked my boot file.  It seems
that when I boot and  the transfer is to be made between floppy and
hard drive. The hard drive seems to seek and then kicks back the boot
failed mgs.  BTW I do have CC3Go in Boot file.  I've also noted that
the clock is not working as before. Never did need to set it, now it
says something like Feb 16,1987 and one second after each boot. And,
I had term setup to be a blue screen with white letters, not it shows
s the old boot screen still at 40 characters. IT's just weird!

I will probably have to change hard drives. Or at least reformat
the first one. will keep you posted.

My CoCo memories are starting to get a little hazy, but as I recall:

The point at which the boot process changes from floppy to hard drive
can be determined by information in your Init file, which is one of the
three hidden files read from track 34 during booting.  The stock version
picks up OS9Boot from the floppy, then tries to switch to the hard drive
before loading Shell and GrfDrv from /h0/cmds.  (If it can't switch, it
will continue loading them from /d0.)

Important:  Shell and GrfDrv must BOTH be in /h0/cmds, and MUST have the
execution attribute set.  (Since you have re-installed Shell+, I bet this
latter point is your problem.)

 >  BTW I do have CC3Go in Boot file.

Fine; that is safe.  As Dennis mentioned, some folks have moved this
out as an optimization.

It sounds like you aren't accessing the same OS9Boot file that you were
before.  Possibly a different boot disk?  Possibly you had Init modified
to pull OS9Boot from /h0 instead of /d0, and are using a boot disk that
doesn't have the modified Init on Track 34?

BTW, you may also be using the device name "/dd" where I have mentioned
"/h0" above.

 > I will probably have to change hard drives. Or at least reformat

I think that would be somewhat premature.  Since your hard drive works
fine AFTER you have booted (chx/chd), I would say that it is probably
still OK.

Good luck... / Ken

   1.  When I get to GShell_1.24a the ipatch file for GShell_1.25 gives
me an error message "Incorrect file size...patch not complete."

   2.  So I thought I would just rename GShell_1.24a and use it as GShell,
but MVue can't find GShell if I do that.

   3.  As a side comment, when I tried GShell32.pat it wouldn't work either.
It said "Enter Gshell.Pat pathname....over and over and over no matter
what path I entered.

How does one get through this maze?

  If you get:

   PERSONAL ENGINEERING & INSTRUMENTATION NEWS

Look on page 60. There is a article about a company that developed a
blood analizer using OS9000 and RAVE. One thing it mentioned is that
one of the reasons for picking OS9000 over Windows 3.1 and UNIX is
because the OS9000 is a real time OS and that RAVE has builtin KANJI
support. One of their markets is JAPAN.

 > I am using a RS-232 pak, even though I have a 4-in-1.  I am currently

Any reason for RS-232?  What about mods, which ACIA driver do you use?
How about interrupt mods?  I'm using the Disto Clock with the Bruce Isted-
type GIME Toggle.  I never did get it straight if this will replace such
mods as the "diode hack" or whatever. I would assume that if you use a
multipak that pin 8 should be strapped.  Need to check all this out...

I've been experimenting with my modem (Hayes 2400 Optima), on a local
BBS.  It links up using LAP-M, V.42bis, using protocol negotiation.  I
am using OSTerm.  My driver is Std ACIAPAK with increased buffer size.
When I have my computer set for 9600, there is a huge amout of character
droppage.  At 4800, I get pretty fair performance, but still lose some,
I think it's due to the screen printing. When the BBS sends a screenful,
it displays a prompt "*** Slap a Key ***", then backspaces and prints
the next line at that line when you "slap".  With destructive cursor turned
on in OSTERM, I think a backspace is converted to BS-Space-BS-(maybe another
BS??).
Anyway, that is one pt where I lose out.  However, you can really tell
More?
a difference in the speed at which text comes across the screen.  I hope
to get this to work.

You problems are caused by not having hardware flowcontrol when using
std ACIAPAK, which is necessary when using error correcting/data compressing
modem protocals. If you install SAcia, your lose of recieved caracter
problem will be solved... (assumeing your RS-232 device supports RTS/CTS)

Yes, the lack of support lines is a drawback.  If you've been following

have all the lines.  I have an MPI and Deluxe RS232, but hate to put

RE: not having hardware flow control.  I had the modem set for software
flow control, and figured that that would do the trick for ascii stuff.
I'm using the ACIAPAK with bigger buffers.  I have a disassembly of it, and
I noticed it sends XOFF when the buffer is full-16 bytes, (the original
sent it on 10 shy.  I've thought about possibly bumping it up to 25 or 30.

I just grabbed SACIA yesterday, never had gotten it, but I have a Disto
4in1 hooked up and it doesn't have the necessary lines.  I have an MPI &
Tandy Deluxe Pak, but for one thing I don't think the PAL chip has been
upgraded (I've used it, and didn't see any prob).  I got the pak from
CoCoPro and it was supposed to have a new pal in it, but the chip is dated
'86, I think and I believe it has Tandy on it, and I've heard that this is
an old chip.

If I use sacia.mpi, will I need to strap the #8 connectors in the mpi, or
can I get by without it?  I have the Disto Clock and it has been patched
with the Isted GIME toggle, so what else do I need to use the MPI (I used to
use it and got good results at 2400).  Won't these mods eliminate the need for
wiring a line straight to the IRQ of the CPU?  As I said, I've had pretty good
More?
luck at 2400, but have not tried the faster rates till now.

In looking over ACIAPAK, one thing that has me puzzled.. How does it keep from
halting when an XOFF character comes across in a binary file???

If by local hardware control, you mean RTS/CTS control, then yes it can do it.
I suppose that there are different ways of doing local hardware control. We
made those mods (from a 16 pin to a 10 pin, and dropping a few lines) at the
request of Radio Shack/ Tandy because they wanted to carry the 4IN1 in their
line along with our SCII. It never happened, but we didn't want to change
the design again so we stayed with the 10 pin. -Tony.

OK.. I'll get back to you.  As I said, I may be  upgrading to another type

really just experimenting around with the thing, and am not sure that this
thing can even support data compression usefully or not.  I already have
a Tandy Deluxe interface, but, repeating myself again, I kinda hate to plug
that darn MPI back in, might affect my SC-2 etc, and they seem to work
flawlessly without it... thank you for these fine products.

Uh-Huh, of course when you were selling them originally, there was no need
for RTS/CTS, because compression then was either unavailable or out of our
price range.  However, I have been playing around with my system on a local
BBS; I set my CoCo at 4800 baud and set it for XON/XOFF local control, and
I could tell a marked difference between the speed data was coming across
the screen at this rate, and when I was in asynchronous mode with 2400 baud
across them.  I was losing a few characters, I think due to screen printing,
and want to check it out further.  Thanks again for all you have done.

     MM/1A Mouse Salvation
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

Regarding the continuing mouse "problems" of the 68340'd MM/1:

I downloaded a set of mouse drivers for windio #38 from one of the Database
areas.  Lo and behold, the msdrv.t2.ms driver works with the Logitech mouse.

I had assumed that since Kevin Pease only included one mouse driver that
it was somehow different from the 070 one.  It doesn't seem so.  Right now
I have a Logitech  MouseMan serial hooked up, and all three buttons seem
to function properly.  James is trying out a Logitech Trackman now.

So those of you interested may want to try this out.

One thing that comes to mind off the top of my head is the buffer size in
Sacia. What did you set that to? Also, is /t2 set for the same baud rate
as your connect speed? What about the baud rate of the window that you
are running the comm program in? Sometimes that may cause lost chars as
the data coming in from /t2 is faster than what can be displayed in teh
window...

Oops, I should have made it clear:  you should only need to do the
copy/reformat/restore steps if you want to reconfigure your old drives
for 512-byte sectors.  Otherwise, you should be able to continue using
them as long as you wish, with Matt's driver replacing scsi47.

I kinda figured that, although, what would be the sense in going to the
newer driver without reformatting for the 512 byte sectors to gain the extra
drive space?? That would be the biggest reason there as well as the
advertised faster access times/read times. Do you know if anyone(Matt or
anyone else) has worked on the SCSI tape driver mentioned in the docs yet?
Now THAT would be a real bonus!!!

Use dmode to set the size how you want it. Save the descriptor and fix
the CRC with fixmod. Change the reference in your bootlist to the new
ramdisk descriptor and regen.

If you have the OS-9/68000 that is sold with the PT68K series board you
have a file in the IO directory called r0.a.  Chd to IO, edit the R0.a file
for the size of ramdisk you want and make r0.  Chd to the CMDS/BOOTOBJS

By more slowly, do you simply mean slower than SCSI-2?  They would still be

I would think that 3 meg would be minimal for most applications.

As for the RAM, I have found 3 megs to be adequate for the majority of program
ports and applications currently available.   More RAM is always nice, and the
ability to expand to 8 megs is on the way.   I've already paid Kevin Pease for
the package needed
to get 8 meg upgrade buss cards made, and intend to be ready to offer them for
sale soon.   Pricing is not yet firm though, as I've yet to  cost the
production firmly.
