lucy.ifi.unibas.edu is not known domain.  Do you have a filename for GNU Make
on chestnut?  The only make is make.ar in the OS9 (6809) section.  There is
makeinfo and m4 in the /pub/OSK/GNU directory on chestnut.cs.uwisc.edu.

I have Bob Van Der Poel's ved/vpt combo.  Not familiar with the w/p you
speak of, but this setup can really put out some great text.  This is a
separate text editor/Text Formatter combo (vpt could work with any text
editor), but I am really impressed.

You may have to set up your own vpt..init file, (something like a printer
descriptor file, although examples for several printers are included), but
when you get it set up, you can produce some really fabulous text.  The
control codes may be a little ambiguous, but they work.  I understand Bob
was the writer of Telewriter 64/128.

     Boot Problem
     From: NEALSTEWARD  To: ALL

HELP!!! I can't figure this one out...
When I os9gen a bootdisk, mount it in drive 0 and type DOS, the read heads
move to track 34 and the OS9 BOOT message appears as it should.  The problem
I am having is that it immediately goes to the hard drive to finish the boot
process and will not allow me to boot entirely from floppy.  When I try this
on a system without a HD, the boot just seems to hang up as if it is looking
for a HD.  So I cannot generate a system boot for my son's floppy based
system.  I can boot successfully from my ORIGINAL system master floppy on
both systems, but then I don't have access to my hard drive unless I manually
load HDisk and H0.  I split the orignal OS9boot file into separate modules
and os9gened a new one with ALL the same original modules, and the problem
reoccured!?  I have checked the CRS's of all the modules and os9gen and

everything is the same.  Does anyone know why this occurs?  Can it be a
function of RGBDOS or the RGB utilities that allow for booting OS-9 from the
HD?  How do I correct the problem?
(FYI: I have a 2 meg Coco 3, 80 meg SCSI HD, Ken-Ton SCSI Interface, Disto
SCII with a Tandy Smartwatch and RGBDOS partitioned with 5 RSDOS compatible
drives for OS9 bootfiles.)

                                   Thanks for any help,
                                   Neal

     RE: Boot Problem (Re: Msg 87052)
     From: RANDYKWILSON To: NEALSTEWARD

If it goes to the hard drive to get the OS9BOOT file, after loading the
base kernel from track 34 on floppy, then you have a modified Boot module.
I do not see a 6309 listed in your message, so I'm going to assume no PBoost
or Nitros. This trick will only work if both systems are the same CPU-wise.

  First, boot with your original Tandy disk. Then, insert your new disk, and
press reset *once*. When you hit reset only once, OS9 re-reads the OS9BOOT
file, without reloading the kernel from track 34. Since the kernel currently
in memory is the Tandy, it will go to floppy for the bootfile.
  The other side of this is os9gen and cobbler. This utilities always write out
the kernel that's in memory to track 34. So, at this point, you can 'gen a boot
for your son, and it will get the floppy Boot module. The bad side is that
you'll lose any patches you've done to the kernel (OS9P1 only).

  And, since this *is* OS9, there is another way to do it. Somewhere lurking
in the data base here is a utility called KUtil. This was specificly designed
to do things like this. It will allow you to "lift" the Boot module from the
Tandy disk (floppy), and stick it into the track 34 stuff of your new disk.
It's been a while since I've worked with this, so exact details are hazy. Read
the docs. :>

     From: WDTV5        To: NEALSTEWARD

Hi Neal; From the description, its most obvious cause is that you are using
the module "boot", part of track 34 from the RGB software kit. Your easiest
fix is to go back to the database here and get my package of krnlutils.
They are designed to make accessing the track 34 stuffs *much* easier.
Between that utility kit, and my "vfy", preferably the latest edition, you can
do anything you want to do to the "hidden track" of an os9 bootable diskette.
I'd suggest making a fresh dir of the hard drive call KRNL or some such, then
using vfy, split the kernal off the distribution disk to get the stock "boot",
do the same with the one that won't work, and re-merge or cpa them back using
the stock boot in place of yours. The krnlutils kit has a util to make a
directory entry and fd that points to the kernal track which then can be copied
off
to wherever, and a "krnlmvr" util that can take a kernal track from anyplace
that has a direntry pointing to it and put it back on your sones disk, can't
spell either! But its easier to do than to describe once the utility's are
in hand.  Don't feel too bad, I've done the same thing a time or 2 when I
was running an older st-238r. Now I'm scsi and went back to a floppy based
boot, I change mine sometimes daily and doing that on the hrad drive is too
much like playing russian roulette with all 6 chambers loaded! This way I
can just back up one generation fof floppy and hit the reset twice to
recover. fewer headaches by far even if the floppy boot is slow.

The problem is probably that you have a modified sysgo or init
along with H0 defined. Try nameing H0 HD. Further, if DD is
defined as the hard drive, you will have to delete it from the
boot file and insert a DD driver that looks to the floppy.
Hope this helps.

PS. I believe DD must be defined as a floppy drive even if
you have not modified your sysgo or init files.

Eh?  Ink jets that can do color are definitely over $400, but several
black-and-white ink jet printers are well under $400.

If all the ink jets you have seen are over $400, either you have
definitely been looking in the wrong places, or you don't consider
anything that prints in black only to be an inkjet. <grin>

For color printing, (unless for some strange reason you are only
printing color text), a dot matrix can't touch and inkjet for quality.
A dot matrix simply has too much banding and smearing, and not enough
saturation.

Frankly, I would trade my color-capable Citizen GSX-140 24-pin any day
of the week for a Canon BJ-200 or H-P DJ500...maybe even an Epson Stylus.

I must admit I don't do color printing, or printing that would really

Are you implying that a b/w ink jet is as inexpensive as a 24 pin?

I'm assuming you are asking how to call it from "CC"?  If so, you have
2-3 options.

 1) Rename rma c.asm in commands file.
 2) Stop before assembly ( cc1 -a prog...) then call "rma" manually.
 3) There are several replacement "cc's" available here and elsewhere
    that are/can be modified.
 4) Edit current "cc1".  Use "ded" or other means to locate character
    string "c.asm".  Then replace with "rma\0".  Be sure to terminate
    it with the null (original 'm' will be ignored).

You will also have to use "rlink" to link the code, since the original
"c.link" cannot handle "rma" output, since "rma" includes additional
data.  "rlink" _CAN_, however, link code produced by "c.asm".
The above suggestions can apply for "rlink" also.

As long as the source is in C (or perhaps basic) the code should be portable.
Unfortunately the program may require more mempry than the 6809's 64k
workspace.  You may be able to work around this using virtual memory,
but you would have to write the paging routines, which may or may not
be easy <g>.  Of course if I remeber right the dvi-esc/p2 program requires
the input file to be a Tex dvi file and Tex is just too large to run
on the CoCo.

  Well Frank, we went to the speedier means last night to cut time ratios from
 Canada.  As youo suggested,, download.   I downloaded theh latest ver of
a
 nice things added.  Unless you using a PC for your subscriberlist,,, you
 may want to use theh mailer in this one.   It goes anywhere from a simple
 "aunt Martha's Christmas list,, to a pub;      
 publishers (international) mail base.  EXp dates an all.  It beats anything
 I've seen.

  BTW,, could get "Y" modem to recieve in ULTERM???   Xmodem worked fine.  now
 I gotta move 'em to OS with OS-Copy.  Dan      
Darn,, I may have to learn OS yet.
  Til then,,, Terry Simons

Not a big point, but every time I see the remark about osterm not
having ASCII upload, I like to point out that some kind soul created
"slowio" which I'm sure must be in the telcom data base here.
You just use the clear key to toggle to another window and type+
  slowio <filename >/t2
where "filename" is the ascii file you want to upload.  Once you get the
hang of it, it's really very easy.  If you toggle back to the osterm
window while the file is still uploading, you can see the characters
go by.
I mention it because I think that without slowio, I'd be looking for a
replacement for osterm which I love in every other respect.
