Tim,
Thanks for the info on displaying "movies". I will try to keep this in mind
when (if) I get a second serial port. Thanks for the help.

I may have a solution.  Using a terminal program that supports ASCII send,
simply connect to your modem and leaving it on-hook, echoing, send the
file..  The modem will echo the data back to the term program and it works
quite well.  I don't have KBCom, but using SuperComm, which has something
of an "ANSI" mode, will get through the process fairly well.  In trying
"trek", it seems that about 600 Baud is as fast as it can go... must be
losing data... when the outpost blows up, any faster rate and the effects
of the explosion don't work right... It isn't the BEST way, but at least
you can see what is going on.

I have G-Windows, and it is vt100..  I was able to just "merge" or "list".
They go by a little fast, as apparently the baud rate doesn't seem to affect
the speed from the keyboard, but they do work.

    I LOVE V-Term. The menus are a bit kludgy to get through but it's I'm
shure the only RS-DOS term program that actually multitasks! :) The file
handling is great too IE: Ramdisk, not just a buffer, and enhanced control
over the ram and normal RS-DOS drives. My first term program. Of course I
soon went to OS9, and then when I went back to RS-DOS I used Ultimaterm
because I forgot my way around V-Term and Ultimaterm had more of an OSTerm
feel. :) V-Term is great though. Oh, yea, I liked to get colored ANSI garbage
that V-Term filtered out also. <g>

          This should get you started. You need to pass ALL the
   registers, not just the ones you are going to use.<<

        Thanks for the info John. That seems to have gotten me started.
   It was succesfull, SORT of. I got it to work but when it list the
   files, it returns an error #015 after each file, and it lists them all
   as NOT a directory, even if it is a directory file. Should I
   initialize some other variables perhaps? A #15 error btw, indicates an
   illegal mode, but I don't know where this comes from. It's possible
   that the second error is a result of the first maybe.
        Here's the updated code...

        PROCEDURE dirsyscall
   TYPE file=filename(29),lsn(3):BYTE
   TYPE regs=cc,a,b,dp:BYTE; x,y,u:INTEGER
   DIM register:regs

   DIM temp:STRING
   DIM diskpath:BYTE
   DIM opt(1):BYTE
   fd_att:=$00
   register.a:=diskpath
   register.b:=$0F
   register.x:=ADDR(opt)
   register.y:=1
   OPEN #diskpath,".":READ+DIR
   WHILE EOF(#diskpath)<>TRUE DO
   GET #diskpath,name
   IF name.filename(1)<>0 THEN
   count=0
   temp=""
   REPEAT
   count=count+1
   temp:=temp+CHR$(LAND(name.filename(count),$7F))
   UNTIL count=0 OR name.filename(count)>127 OR name.filename(count )=0
   PRINT temp
   RUN syscall($0F,register)
   IF LAND(fd_att,$80)=0 THEN
   PRINT "is not a directory!"
   endif
   IF LAND(fd_att,$80)=1 THEN
   PRINT "is a Directory!"
   ENDIF
   ENDIF
   ENDWHILE
   CLOSE #diskpath

        For some reason the '1' on the dir attribute bit is not being set
   when it should.

Chris, you got several things going wrong here. First off, you are setting
register.a to diskpath BEFORE you open the path. But in this case, that
doesn't matter. SS.Fd works on a path open to the target file. Diskpath is
open to the parent dir. So....

  Dim path2:byte
  ...
  Print temp
  Open #path2, temp
  register.a=path2
  RUN syscall($8d,register)
  Close #path2
  If LAND(register.cc,1)=1 then
  (do something about the error from getstat)

Hmmm...maybe I should switch back to the canonical tile set; the default
I use with the "tiles" program is probably easier to distinguish.  tiles
keeps the top times, which reinforces attempts at speed rather than solving
all the configurations.  (I'll say...looking at the stats in another window,
I see that I've won about 17 percent of the games I've played.)

  I've seen some of th variety tile on the Amiga.  Like in chess
 whenever you deviate from theh standard set,, it detracts from your
 concentration.  thus you never see a chess player worth his salt (a good

     ****OS-9 Late Night:Nitros9 and Tune-Up w/Northern Xposure****
                Monday Night September 26, at 10:00 pm Eastern

        Alan Dekok, and perhaps even Colin McKay(not sure about Colin
   yet), will be online to discuss the soon to be released Nitros9 update
   and also ANOTHER one of Alan's projects(these guys DO keep busy!)
   called Tune-Up which enhances a stock 6809 Level II system for those
   who don't want to go 6309.
        When is a tentative date for the release of Nitros9?
        How much will it cost?
        Is 19.2K going to be a reality!?!?
        Is Tune-Up at all comparable to Nitros9?

        I don't have the answer to all these questions, but tomorrow

     Line Printer V

A friend of mine got a hold of a Tandy Line Printer V.  It has a
Centronics 36 pin connector in it, but I am not sure if it is serial
or parallel.  Does anyone know this or should I just connect it to
see if it works?  I was under the impression that all the older Tandy

The linprinters were all PARALLEL ports! None of the Tandy printers were
serial until the CoCo came along, with the exception of a few daisy wheel
printers.
The TRS-80 models used parallel printers also. The CoCo was designed toe
a low cost system, and it was determined that a serial port would make more
sense,
because it could be used for several different devices and also could be
partially
software driven, reducing the amount of hardware needed (therefore reducing
costs).

You are using a CoCo?  Probably is not set to send a carrier detect.  The
ACIA will not receive anything from the modem until it senses a Carrier
Detect.. The Hayes command is "at&c0".

   Try using a syscall (as Tim said in his message). The +13 comes from the
Shell.

  Try This:

PROCEDURE forktest
TYPE registers=dat(8),add(5):INTEGER
DIM regs:registers
DIM callcode:INTEGER
DIM name:STRING[32]
DIM parm:STRING[256]
name:="dir"

callcode:=3
REM F$Fork
regs.dat(1):=0
REM lang/type code (0=any)
regs.dat(2):=32000
REM optional mem modifier
regs.dat(3):=256
REM size of param memory
regs.dat(4):=3
REM number of paths to inherit
regs.dat(5):=130
REM priority setting
regs.add(1):=ADDR(name)
regs.add(3):=ADDR(parm)
regs.add(2):=0
RUN syscall(callcode,regs)

   Works for me!!!

I've finally begun to play with Ghostscript.  Unfortunately, I haven't

I can get a kwindows preview, what I can't get is a printout.  If I try

process chess.ps.  GS runs for a while then drops to a GS> prompt.
No file is created in /dd/tmp.

The command line I tried is:

  gs2 -sDEVICE=escp2 chess.ps

Any ideas?

First, due to a little oversight by yours truly, Ghostscript likes
to find its target directory in env variable TEMP -- AND, it has
to end with a slash.  --setenv TEMP /dd/tmp/--.  Without that,
you might find the output in your working directory with a name
that starts with "tmp". (oops)

You can also set your own path on the command line by changing
your line to

  gs2 -sDEVICE=escp2 -sOUTPUTFILE=chess.printer chess.ps

("chess.printer") could be replaced by ANY legal os9 name or
complete path.

Then, "merge" the printer file to the printer.

  -sOUTPUTFILE=/p also works -- but you have to zero all the
values in the printer descriptor first. (with xmode).

That should get it working for you.  Yell if you still have
trouble.

Have you tried the -sOUTPUTFILE option?  When I've tried

 -sOUTPUTFILE=/p

it worked just fine for me.  (I had to turn off the tabc and lf options on

 I have a case of terminal unknown settings. What I mean is that I have a
'MicroData'
Terminal, model ' PRIZIM ' , yes that is the model, and i need to find some docs

or atlease the settings for the three sets of dip switches in the back.
 Is there anyone out there who may know about this model, please leave me some

Marty;

  I am looking at getting a new printer. What I would like to get is a
LASER printer Will this work with a COCO3 and the parallel port on a
disto 4n1 board. I thought I remembered you listing a pinout for it or
at least some    instruction on how to hook one up in the '68 Micro
 a while back. could you help me with this ?  Can this connection be
made thru the use of just a parrallel cable?

I see no reason why a laser printer can't be physically hooked to
the parallel port of a Disto 4 in 1 board.  Tho I have heard of ONE
case where a CoCo style serial to parallel printer COULD NOT
work with the parallel port of a given make and model of EPson
printer, due to some obscure timing problem on the strobe line.

The main problem I see, tho, is that most Laser Printers work in
Hewlet Packard Laserjet - compatible mode, which requires long
escape sequences to define fonts, underline, bold, etc.  No CoCo
software I know of supports this.   Some laser printers, tho,
can be set to emulate an Epson printer, and this might make things
easier for use with CoCo word processing programs.

Marty,

The only program for the CoCo that I know of which supports long escape
sequences for printers is VPrint from Bob van der Poel.  If VPrint is used
with a good text editor, powerful word processing is possible with OS9 and
probably a laser printer too.

Thanks Howard, and thanks too for the tip on the books.

The REAL credit for Ghostscript goes to L. Peter Deutsch of Aladdin,
(ghost@aladdin.com) and a long list of helpers.

I just fumbled with it until I got the MM/1 and the GNU compiler
to swallow it without choking. (GRIN).

     New Tex Upload
     From: JOHNREED     To: TIMKIENTZLE (NR)

Tim,
Grabbed your new TeX system over the weekend.
Followed your instructions, ran the install script
and sat back and watched.

Nice Job!

So far, everything works just as it should on my machine
(MM/1a, 9-meg).

The ONLY error message I saw was when Metafont (called by
dvips) tried to copy it's ".tfm" files into
"/dd/sys/tex/fonts/tfm/new" - no "/new" directory.  I assume
the "/new" directory would be there to save new ".tfm".s in
case they were not in the TFM dir already.  That error did
NOT stop the program.

I tested the regular executables first, then installed the
ones in the "BIG" directory, using your instructions and
scripts again.  Then ran a HUGE tex file that I had been
unable to run before.  (It worked, of course)

Now all I have to do is read all those doc files, and maybe
buy another book.

Looks like you put a lot of time into this one -- Thanks.
