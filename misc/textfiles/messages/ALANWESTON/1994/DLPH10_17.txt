     From: GREGL        To: MRGOOD

More than likely the problem is caused by the MM/1 not properly implementing
one of the VT52/VT100 control codes or escape sequences. I do not know
what you can do about it unless you can find the offending string and
have the terminal program strip it. I do know one of the sequences sets
the keyboard to application mode.

Making this short because I am using a stupid version of Telnet that
sends control character garbage when I use a non alphabetic character.
Sheesh.

Why in the world did they use ESC = for Bold switch? Seems to me they
could have used an extension to the ANSI color change sequence to speficy
bold -- assuming Bold is not already defined in the PC ANSI sequence --
and not have a problem when running true VT52/VT100 emulation. Oh well,
such is life.

Simple -- that's what the CC3 Level 2 windows used.  (Truly "backwards
compatibility").

But K-Windows also supports "ESC [ 1 m", which is the ANSI sequence
for Select Graphic Rendition:  Bold or increased intensity.

OK.  I'll have to check that out.  Haven't used sterm in a long time.  Kept
several versions so maybe I'll try them all and see if I get the same effect.

  I have had the Zmodem thinge happen to me many times. I have executed a
ZModem download using KTerm V2.1 and at the end of the download have
Delphi start another. After terminating the download, Delphi would try and
start another. I don't think it is the ZModem on my end. KTerm uses a
external ZModem routine. I have used the same routine with STerm. then
too, it doesn't always happen. I would say mabey 1 time out of 20 Delphi
Sessions. I have had this to happen on Delphi, finally get out of it,
close Delphi, dail up another BBS, use the same ZModem with perfect
results.

Hi, John -

As you may have noted from one of my subsequent messages, this isn't a
bug, but rather it is a function that has been included as part of the
"CC3 Level2 Windows Compatibility".  As you know, K-Windows provides both
this compatibility and some (limited) VT100/220 support.

Sorry, my mistake. It was sounding like they were going with VT52/VT100/ANSI
emulation instead of the CoCo emulation codes. I guess they used a combination
of the two, which does make sense. Now let's just hope nobody thinks I'm an
assinine swine and beat me with a club. :-)

Yeah.  That ones on my list, too. (disabling screen pause).  It's
not as big a problem with the newer version, since it doesn't scroll
the display; it uses a rolling display like `xydown' used.  Nevertheless,
I'll try to get the screen pause fixed before the next release.
(By the end of the month if all goes well.)

This seems a little like what happened to me.  A second d/l seemed to be
attempted.. But when I broke out of "z", it I got to the "What do you want
to do" prompt.. Then my username appeared ("No such command" or whatever")
Then my password appeared..

 > too, it doesn't always happen. I would say mabey 1 time out of 20 Delphi

Yeah, you get timeouts...  I think this is when the lines get busy..
However, after the first d/l, (the file seemed to be intact, unzipped with
no errors), I decided to get the ghostscript forte.. Used "rz", would get
bunches of timeouts, but d/l'ed everything.

The above really seems weird.  Don't know if my computer sent a code to cause
this or what.

        It was basically a dead night last night. I didn't think the

   won't be a transcript but we will reschedual the conference again for
   sometime in November, on a better. While I'm on the subject, Winter
   seems to be a good season for the Online world, since more people are
   inside, so I expect that it will be an even better season for OS-9
   Late Night. Last night was just a bad night since only a couple people
   showed up, so when I finish the November schedual, everyone will know
   the reschedualed date.

        Next week, we will have Animajik/Fat Cat Publications. This is

 I canceled my other account, it was effective immediately. I thought my

 the hard way when I answered 'y' at the _are you sure?_ prompt. I guess I'll
just take the loss.

 I wish I could keep both accounts actually, but financially I have to start

cut down one or 2 a month in the future, depending

Hey!  If my info is correct, he hit it lucky.  He has a board that supports
RTS/CTS hardware handshaking, which will make it work better with new
hi-speed modems.

Good idea.  He should be able to provide all the info.. He's here as DISTO,

David -

I think you will probably want to continue including STerm as well (which
I am sure you meant to do...)

STerm still serves many useful functions, such as providing CIS-B
protocol for CompuServe, and ASCII text uploading (though I personally
consider the unprompted nature of STerm's text upload to be unreliable).

Thanks, Ed.  This would be pretty obvious, but I hadn't even thought about
it.  It would be a LITTLE more sophisticated.

Yeah, need to check it out.. I played around with tsmon on the CoCo once,
going to the terminal, but never fooled with it that much.. sometimes
memory got kinda tight on it  <G>

Gotta get over this memory hangup..  I need to get used to the idea that I
have plenty and if I run out, I can just put in some more :-)

     HAM Radio Software
     From: MRUPGRADE    To: KB8SFC

  You and others have asked for an address and brief discription
of Dynamic Electronics HAM Programs.  While Bill Chapel is now
active with HAM Radio on the PC, he also still supports the
CoCo.   "Mid Iowa & Country CoCo" has aquired an OS-9 tutitoral
series and other articles from Bill, for reprint in The UPGRADE
Diskmagazine.

   Prices range from $7 to $30.  I didn't want to list them a
here, so as not to creat an ad persay,, but rather to answer
general information asked for.  Dynamic has a variety of other
software available as well.  Whether CoCo or PC, if you'r into
HAM Radio, I'd look to Bill (Phone and address at the end of
file) for some good HAM software support.

  The following is a very condensed listing from:
     The UPGRADE May '93.   (also other issues)

 MORSE TERM 3:
 This is all you need to send and receive Morse Code with your
color computer. Interface cables are included for connecting the
computer to your transceiver. These connect from your
transceiver's "AUDIO" output and "KEY" input jacks to  the
"Serial I/O" and "Right Joystick"  ports of a color computer. A
"Y" adaptor and external speaker is needed to monitor the audio
or audio can be fed to the computer via a cassette cable. To
transmit just type the Morse characters or send any of 8
preprogrammed messages. Messages can also be sent from a tape or
disk file. For receiving, the program automatically adjusts to
the speed of the code and copies and displays the characters up
to about 30 wpm. The keyer is for solid state Transceivers with
a maximum key up voltage of 15 volts. We can provide
instructions for building a keying relay for use with vacuum
tube transceivers. A 3-circuit 1/4 inch plug is included to plug
into the transmitter's key jack.  A stereo to mono adaptor plug
(not included) is required for 2 circuit keying.  MTERM-CD
(Disk)

 STATION and REPEATER LOGS:
 The STATION LOG keeps a record of your contacts. Just enter the
information as it is requested. Items that are the same such as
date, frequency, and type of emission need only be entered once
and changed as needed.  Save, Print, or add to the log and
quickly find stations.  The REPEATER LOG finds re- peaters by
City, Frequency, or Call Signs. List all the repeaters in a City
or all of the repeaters on a frequency. Add comments such as
beam  headings or access information. Enter a call sign and all
repeaters using that call are displayed.  Also lists repeaters
in frequency increments and prints the results to a printer.
Files can be loaded from disk or tape. For the color computer 3
the 32, 40 or 80 column screen can be choosen.
 Both logs are included.   LOG-D (Disk)
      HR-1 MORSE:    HR-1D (Disk)

      AUDIO LAB (new):
 This is a collection of three programs that allow you to use
your computer as a precision audio frequency generator, an audio
frequency counter, or an audio spectrum analyzer. The spectrum
analyzer can be used as a tuning meter for ham radio teletype
and slow scan television.  A cassette cable is used for audio
IN/OUT to the computer. AL-D (Disk)
   HAM RTTY TERMINAL:
 Uses the cassette port. Requires a simple interface to connect
cassette audio into the Mic jack and receiver audio into the
cassette port. Interface instructions are included 60, 75, & 100
WPM Baudot. RTTY-D (Disk)
   WEATHER FACSIMILE (WEFAX):
 Draw weather maps on the screen.  Feed your transceiver's audio
into the cassette port. Requires a joystick.   WEFAX-D
(Disk)
   HAM RADIO STUDY PROGRAMS:
 These programs drill you on the questions that are on the FCC
exams.    Study programs on Disk (-D)
   NOVICE TECHNICIAN  GENERAL  ADVANCED  EXTRA

   RADIO MODS (New):  This is a collection of articles on
various radio modifications for ICOM, Kenwood, Yaesu and other
manufacturers of ham radio equipment and scanners. These can be
viewed on the screen or printed on your printer.   RM-D (Disk)

   KING JAMES BIBLE ON DISK:

     RE: Shell+ 2.2a bug (Re: Msg 90290)
     From: 01GEN40      To: CHYDE


Hi Chris,

  Well, I guess that is that then.  I have the docs for Shell+ V2.1, there
is no need for you to email them to me.  There had to be some kind of a
text file included with Shell+ V2.2, if changes were made there should have
been documentation on those changes/modifications.  When I submit my util-
ity DSCAN, I update the documentation and the README files with those and
include them with the program code.
  I have Shell+ V2.2a and a (short) documentation file was included with
it.  That tells me there had to be a doc file for V2.2.
  Well, maybe I should quit persuing this and pretend that Shell+ V2.2a is
no different than V2.1.  That is except for the "." that appears when us-
ing the <BREAK> key or <CTRL>-E to end a program.  According to the docs
for V2.2a, that bug was supposed to be fixed!  Oh well!  See ya.

LONG LIVE OS-9! <FOREVER> ** In whatever form it is in!

     From: MITHELEN     To: 01GEN40 (NR)

Accroding to the docs with the Shell+ 2.2a archive, it is a bugfix release of
the limited release V2.2, which had command line history as its significant
feature improvement (I never saw 2.2, and I bet 99% of the CoCo population
never did either) This one thing makes it significantly diferent then 2.1
though... As I look through the docs, I also see that it fixes bugs found in
previous version in the mode that directories were opened in, it fixes the
"^" (set priority) option, and fixes unlinking of ShellSub modules. This
seems to document it pretty well... I don't see why there HAS to be documention
for V2.2, since it sounded more like a test release to beta testers, and not
for public consumption.

     Gopher Problems here.
     From: JOHNBAER     To: GREGL


   Hello Greg,

   Continuing from our privet mail about the OS-9 Sig gopher,
here's something I did find that didn't work.  Trying to download
a `.ar' file from chestnut, the Sig gopher tries to `get' the
file as a `text' files, failes, then asked if I wanted to try
a `binary' format.  So far, so good.  I tell it `y'es, it does
it, asked for download protocol, I give it zmodem, the file is
now on my system.

   Now, I go to another window, use `ar -t' to check the file
contents, `ar' tells me that `this is not an archive or file
is corrupted'...  I used dump to look at the file, found 584
bytes BEFORE the start of the `ar' file!

   Looks like, to me, that Delphi didn't flush the buffer before
the second attempted `get' of the file in binary format.

   Also, I noted that the `incoming' directory didn't show on
the `list' that the gopher gave for chestnut.

   Anyone else having problems with the OS-9 Sig gopher, please
join in here.  Lets get this `fixed' for other users of the Sig.

   Thanks Greg, and anyone else who joins in here!!!

     RE: Gopher Problems here. (Re: Msg 90339)
     From: GREGL        To: JOHNBAER

As I mentioned to you in mail, Delphi is using a Gopher to FTP translator
for getting to the FTP sites. I originally set it up using gopher.gsfc.nasa.gov
as the translator. Upon investigation this evening, I found gopher.uiuc.edu
seems to be somewhat better (at least it knows .gz files are binary whereas
all of the others say text). So, anyway, I changed all of the FTP sites to
use gopher.uiuc.edu and also added the incoming directory for Chestnut.

Unfortunately it's the Gopher to FTP translator sites that handle binary/text
extensions so there's nothing we can do about binary files showing as text.
If you want my opinion, these things should at least allow the users to
specify whether the files are text or binary. Alas, this seems to make too
much sense so nobody does it this way.

If I sound sarcastic, it's because I'm in a rotten mood right now. Sorry
'bout that.

     PowerBoost & SCII
     From: NEALSTEWARD  To: ALL

Can anyone suggest how I can get B&B's PowerBoost to patch my SCII
drivers, since I use the alternately addressed version?  PB tuneup
skips the SCII drivers and I cannot use the ones addressed at $FF74-
$FF77 because of a conflict with the Ken-Ton SCSI pak.
 if I make a boot with the regular drivers, run tuneup and
then use ded to patch the 10 or 12 bytes that are different so CC3disk
addresses $FF58-5F?  Has anyone else discovered thsi problem?

Those are directory name entries, that lha 2.11[a-c] seem to ignore when
it sees them. It does extract the full pathnames though if you tell it to.

     The Pink Rose bbs and the CDROM project
     From: MDALENE      To: ALL

    As some of you may remember. I ran The Pink Rose bbs. which was located
in Winsted, Connecticut U.S.A. Well we moved and are up again. The New
location is Mansfield Ct, USA. Telephone number is 202-429-6338. Fidonet
1:327/6338
    The Pink Rose is attempting to re-establish itself after its two year
Hiatus. I really would like to see people login.
    On a RElated note. I found out that I can produce a CD-ROM of Os9
software for no charge from Walnut Creek CDROM. The problem is that my Os9
collection is scant and I do not have enough to fill up 600MB of a CDROM.
Heres where other Sysops who have coco and os9 files come in.
Send a file attach to The Pink Rose addressed to Michele Marie Dalene
Please make all your archives inside of your attach LHA 2.11 compliant
archives. and Include descriptions for the files. If you use Remote Access
1.11 use the RA Files.bbs form. RIBBS uses a similar form. that includes
filename and description. No need of file sizes. I will create that info
when the archives are ready for CD-ROM production Please keep archives
smaller than 500KB if possible.
    I do not have a deadline of when this will be ready to distribute as I
only got the basic info. but a NOTE. Make sure filenames are
Msdos-compliant. as they will be stored on QIC-80 tapes which will be sent
to Walnut Creek for the CD-rom production. As well as stored on MY hard
drive for downloading until the package is ready. This option is open to all
os9 users who have file archives. From my own Os9 collection I have
ascertained that we can store alot of the Os9 Level1 and Level 2 as well as
Os9/68K stuff on a CDrom. Please state os9 type in your descriptions!!!
    If you have questions Please reply to me via netmail at 1:327/6338 or
call The Pink Rose at 203-429-6338.
