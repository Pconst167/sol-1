I would certainly hope that Bell Atlantic has more of a vision than did
Tandy, and OS9 will finally get the recognition it deserves.  Tandy did
choose OS9 for the CoCo, but after that they dropped the ball.  OS9 and the
Color Computer were (are) an unbeatable combination of power, low price,
and accessibility.  To my dying day I will be convinced that Tandy COULD
have changed the course of computing if they had concentrated on the CoCo
and OS9 instead of IBM-compatibles, with inexpensive, multitasking,
windowing computers in Radio Shacks in every little town in America.  They
would have had to bring out a CoCo professionally co    onfigured, of course,
with a separate keyboard, built-in MPI and disk drives, etc. (sort of like
your TC-9), but they could have done it inexpensively, and it would have
blown away contemporary IBM's and Macs.  This is all useless speculation,
but I enjoy useless speculation <g>.

Yes, I hope OS9 finally takes off, even though it won't be on the CoCo.

 I doubt that Tandy could have sold the COCO to business in competition with
 the IBM P.C.  As a home computer though it is still, IMO, unparalleled in
 bang per buck.

 However, rumor has it <g> that the OS9 clique at Tandy had a 68000 based
 machine with quality graphics and a GUI in the works around '85 or '86.
 That could have stomped the compatibles and the Mac flat!  However, Tandy's
 management was sleeping with Microsoft at the time so the project got
 squashed.

 Would have been better for the computing world because OS9 is not a "shrink
 wrap" opsys.  Competition would exist not just in the speed of the hardware
 but the efficiency of the port.  Also, because software would have to be
 device independent, the transition to RISC would have probably happened
 four or five years ago in high end PC's and would be reaching the home user
 about now.

 If it sounds like I'm claiming Microsoft and Intel have held computer
 development back, you're right.

 I don't think Tandy can take all the blame. As I recall, Tandy was pushing
OS9 on its CoCo users way back in the beginning. But with documentation that
leaved ALOT to be desired as well as a rather high price tag for the
software, most CoCo users were scared to even attempt OS9. Only in recent
years has the majority taken the plunge. Too little, too late.

>Yes, I hope OS9 finally takes off, even though it won't be on the CoCo.

 I'll second that!

 Well, if your friend's basing that on astrology (mess #85100) I'd have to
 say "get a life!".  The day astrology is a better predictor of system
 behavior than mathematics and physics is the day I quit programming and join
 a drug cult.

 Weather on Earth is a chaotic system and, as such, is very sensitive to
 initial conditions.  Sunspot activity will change slightly the amount of
 energy reaching the Earth and a solar flare will pump out bunches of charged
 particles.  What effect this may have on weather is not at all understood as
 far as I know.

 One article I read claimed that, even if we could identify all of the inputs
 to a chaotic system like the weather, we still couldn't accurately predict
 the state at any time because some of the state changes are random.  Has
 something to do with harmonic confluence or some such phlogiston - I'm not a
 good enough mathematician to understand it completely.

OK, I wasn't exactly right. What I was getting at was that no buffered
IO call is guarenteed to generate ANY system IO call at the time it is
called. The only time a system IO call is generated as a result of a
buffered IO call is if the buffer is full or a newline char is in the
output.

As JJ says, since the standard output path is defined as an SCF device,
any and all calls made by the system to flush a buffered IO cache will
be done with a writeln() call, I conceed that point.

The problem with the code segment is you are using both buffered and
unbuffered I/O.

You need to do a fflush(stdout), or setbuf(stdout, 0) before you start, or
use all unbuffered I/O (ie. write(STDOUT, "hello", 5) - this is awkward so
when I need to do this I use my_write(STDOUT, "hello") where my_write is
the following:

my_write(path, str)
int path;
char *str;
{
  return(write(path, str, strlen(str)));
}

Of course this only works on zero terminated strings.

Hope this helps.  I am sure that others have also replied.

When I was in eighth grade, I got a book out of the library that showed how to

prices of all the tubes, capacitors, etc. in the Lafayette catalog I had, and
it came to over $100!  I didn't have $100 so it never got built.  I paid $129

 I surely hope so!  When I read Dr. Dobbs or C Users Journal I'd get

Upgrade Disk. It was buried in an ar archive in the BOOTMODS/WIN directory

It's actually pretty easy to add sound effects to a C program, provided
you have the effect made and know it's sample rate.  You can use the
_ss_play() feature.  In fact, the article for the latest issue of
68'Micros shows how you can store a digital sound sample in memory and
use the _ss_play() function to play it, all in C.

You are probably right, but the cgfx.l library was written in C, so it
really won't be optimized either.  Also, to write your own routine, all
you'd need to do is send out the appropriate display codes to the
screen, and there's not a whole lot of optimization you can do with that
as it's just a write() function.  You just have to write the correct
sequence of bytes to the window to get the OPutBlk function to work, so
you may wanna give that some thought.

I read in the January issue of _Wired_ that Rupert Murdoch has pruchased
Delphi. He's the guy that owns the Fox Network, TV Guide, and a bunch of
other stuff. This can put Delphi up there with the big boys.
