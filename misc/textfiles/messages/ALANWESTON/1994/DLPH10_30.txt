    LinkUp is a terminal program, but it's not so much what it does but
rather how it does it. LinkUp has the "look and feel" of programs that
you've seen on more mainstream windowing systems. Boisy didn't take the
usual shortcut of forcing people to write setup scripts or type special
commands to configure the program to work the desired way. Everything you
can do in this program can be done on very aestheticly (sp?) pleasing
windows using the mouse.

    Of course, it goes without saying, it's very functional too. :)

Allen, there are a few general rules to play by, but other than that the 1.2M
drives are NOT the problem most people make them out to be! I transfer between
several DIFFERENT machines, all brands, and NEVER have a problem. The general
rule is format the disk on the machine that's doing the writing. But NEVER
overwrite a 360K disk with a 1.2M drive IF the disk had data stored on it.
The problem is that the 360K head is wider. The 1.2M head only lays down a
strip to one side of the track when double stepping, and isn't strong enough
to erase the adjacent remnents of 360K data. So another 1.2M drive will
read that disk, but a 360K drive tries to read the new AND old data.
If you remember that, you'll never have a problem.

  Sounds like the same problem I have with my Teac 1.44 megs (FD-55????).
Apparently they don't (or do?) zero themselves on power-up and the system
gets confused on first access resulting in an error #247. My solution was
to write a prorgram in assembly to zero the drives with a SetStat call
(SS_Reset).

 Here's the Basic version:

PROCEDURE zerodrive
REM reset floppy drive
TYPE registers=dat(8),add(5):INTEGER
DIM regs:registers
DIM callcode,path:INTEGER
callcode:=$8e
OPEN #path,"/d0@"
regs.dat(1):=path
regs.dat(2):=3
RUN syscall(callcode,regs)
END

   Change the '/d0@' to whatever is appropriate.

I believe you are correct in what you say about the 1.2M floppies.
However, we have 45 engineers in our department and only a few
of them can keep your rules straight.  After losing importand
*important* files a few times, I decided it was a lot cheaper
to throw all of the darn things away (sold as surplus, actually).
So now we only have a few left just in case somebody sends us
something on 5.25".  Soon they will be as obsolete as those
silly 8" monsters.

     I have had plenty of spills on bicycles, a handfull of them at over
20 mph. When I got my first mountian bike I was turning pretty fast when
the front wheel slipped on a piece of uneven pavement and before I could
lower my hand to break my fall I was sliding into home (or rather my bike)
on my left forearm. That is MY story of road rash. :) I know how to handle
a bicycle crash though. Most times I have remained standing or even jumped
from the bike. My old Schwinn Varsity was so rugged I used to crash it for
fun.

    It doesn't compare so well with a motorcycle but I like the freedom a
bicycle has over other in-town ways of getting around. I also like the
manuverability. I have had three or so accidents with cars but none of them
were moving. :) I think one reason I ride bicycles so well is that
there is so little between me and the "surface". Bike riding is so much
second nature to me I don't even think about it. Is a motorcycle like that?

     "Laying it down" is not exactly the total defeat you imply-
in fact it's good  stuff, given the clothing. Sort of like bowling,
except you want a split.
     My theory is everyone should be forced to ride a 125 Honda over
broken terrain a few years before they mount a hog. The lessons
learned also apply to the clumsy contraptions sold to the masses.

Bicycling compares somewhat with motorcycling. A small to medium size motorcycle

has all the advantage you mention of a bicycle in traffic. A 250cc is great for
around town and short day trips of a couple hours each way occasionally. A
500cc is prefect for all day rides for one person. The big ones (over 500cc)
are really to heavy to throw around through traffic much. I really loved my
500 (it was 2-stroke.. really quick!), but the 1000 came along when the old
1976 electronic ignition went out. Suzuki wanted $200 for a new box! And the
1000 I stole at $400.00 (been parked for 5 years... 1980 model). Just a little
work and $150 later and it was running great! I put 10,000 mile on it in the 20
months I{{'ve had it so far!!

You are ever so right about the "riding a 125 for a few years"! I started
riding regular in Japan on an 80cc scooter! Then was looking for a good used
350 when I got back, but found a cherry 175 twin and couldn't pass it up.
Never rode that farther than an hour one way though... just wouldn't hold
a steady 70 with me on it! But around town was great. A 250 2-stroke streeter
after that (it has taken a few 4 hour road trips.. will hold 70 drafting a
Mack anyway!), the n  a 500 2 stroker, then the 1000. I was happiest with
the 500 though, as an all around fun bike. The 1000 is a bit on the heavy side
for real twisty road fun... that's why I still have the 250 street racer...

     But,  the old 125 was special. I was an enduro idiot at  the
time  and  somebody  had  just beat a field of Ossas,  etc  at  a
Nationals,   on the then new (and stone stock) XL125. Strange  to
talk  about  a  hi-torque  7.5 cdi 4 stroke,  but  there  it  was
climbing  the  muck in second.  I wasn't the purist he was, so  a
few  bits  and pieces and we had 25 horsepower to go along, in  a
220lb motorcycle (with a 38" seat height!).
     Talk   about  a powered bicycle! For about a half hour,  you
could  run close to 80, a little more on the easy parts, but  one
day  the  fastination of doing this with a GVW of 440lbs and  1cc
over the legal lower limit for freeway vehicles faded.

     Nice  dual  purpose idea I'd buy into again- the  headlight,
tach,  speedo, turn signals and horn formed a sub-assy that  came
off  with 2 bolts and a 24? position connector. I'd hide it in  a
bush and go play.

     monitor advice needed
     From: JEJONES      To: ALL

Help!  My Magnavox 1CM135 monitor fried last week.  I'm getting by on a CM-8
loaner (thanks, Boisy!), and I'm liable to have the Magnavox repaired if only
to have a backup monitor, but...

1. The Magnavox really isn't all that wonderful as far as dot pitch is
   concerned.
2. The MM/1 overscan mode screens definitely overlap the edges, so that
   all those neat buttons in kved and ost are hard to reach.

..so, I'd really really like to find a monitor that is better in those
regards.  I expect I'll go back, do a "read nonstop subj monitor", and
check the accumulated wisdom--it's depressing to see that 15.whatever
KHz scan rate-capable monitors were mentioned as fading out two years
ago--but if anyone has any more recent leads on better monitors, I'd
be interested.  (I'm checking out the Amiga mags, since they have the
same scan rate constraints.  If anyone else has gone that route, I'd
be interested in hearing your experiences.)  Thanks!

Do you need the move to make to finish level three? or the first move(s)
for level 4? (I think you mean the latter) I'm about half way though
level 4, it took me a few days to figure out the first two/three moves.
If you really want to know, I'll let you know in Mail so as not to give
any spoilers to people that want to solve it theirselves...

    To get by this, when you first walk in, you jump to the opposite side of
where the beam is going to fire. A few moments later, Dexter jumps forward.
As he begins that jump, pull back. As soon as he lands, go forward.

     From: NEALSTEWARD  To: ALL

We are running Alpha Softwares Level II BBS (Erie County Color Computer
Club 716-649-1368) for about 3 years now, and we have one bug that we
cna't figure out.  Intermittantly, while typing messages, it drops
3 and only 3 characters.  No matter how long an interval between key-
strokes, it will wait until 3 keys are pressed then resume.  It seems
if it were losing an IRQ, it wouldn't be consistantly the same number
of characters, nor would it continue to ignor all 3 characcters after
waiting for a minute.  And it does have an diode IRQ hack installed.
If anyone knows how to cure this one, we would be extremely grateful.
We used to have 2 lines, but usership has forced us to drop one line,
and now the problem occurs more often.

Well...a few years ago, for a while, Tandy sold CD-i players under the
Memorex label.  They stopped, though, and came out with their very own
box, which they called VIS.  (I don't remember what that stood for.)

Anyway...VIS contained an 80286, and ran, I believe, a version of Microsoft
Windows.

Yeah, I remember a local Radio Shack store salesman assuring me that VIS
would take off and leave CD-i in the dust.

I finally solved my hardware problems, and am now attempting to install

I found that after installing the B&B Powerboost Native patches on my

use /r0 & rammer patched to 384k).  Is there a chance that this somehow
conflicts with the 2 meg upgrade???  It works without the Native patches
and works with the Powerboost Tuneup patches.  Any guesses?  Is there
anyone else running a system like this:
2 meg Coco 3 with HC63B09E, MPI, Ken-Ton SCSI HD, Disto SCII in no-halt

Yes.  Kevin Darling, the original author of 'rammer', warned users when
the 1 meg upgrade was coming out that some of the things he did in there
might break under these.  Some folks seem to have managed to escape the
problem under 1 meg (I removed 'rammer' and switched to 'ram' based upon
Kevin's advice), but lots of folks got bitten under 2 meg.

You need to upgrade 'rammer.'

 Greg,

 Long time no talk!  It's good seeing you on the forum.  Guess you haven't
 completely forgotten us OS-9 types <g>.

 Question re INTERNET.

 I'm looking for an method of getting files from other sites besides ftp'ing
 them.  I 'heard' there is a way files can be requested via the BITFTP
 server at Princeton University.  Supposedly, you send an e-mail message
 to them requesting file(s) and they will be transmitted to your work space
 just like ftp'ing them does.  I've noticed that some of the sites are
 very slow.  Can take almost as long to transfer a file as it does to down-
 load them and this is at 3 or 4 in the AM.

 BTW, I do pay the extra 3 bucks a month so I can take full advantage of
 INTERNET from DELPHI.  I'm asking here because I believe many others on
 this forum would also like to take advantage of this feature.  Any info
 on this will be greatly appreciated.

 Thanks,

 Ed

BitFTP doesn't exactly return the files to your workspace... what it does is
takes commands sent in the form of a mail message, and then the results
of the commands are returned back to you in mail. Commands that do "get"'s of
files will return the files in UUencoded format...

I don't know all the specifics ohn using bitftp... I do have a nifty Unix
Shell script called "uuftp" that "looks and feels" like an ftp session, but
instead of the results being returned real time, it automatically
generates the BitFtp mail message requests for you in the proper format.
and then mails it out at the end ov the uuftp session... works pretty good,
especially if you have a good/fast uucp connection to the internet.

Yeah, I'm still here although not nearly as active in the Forum as I used to
be. I'm usually here at least once each day and try to keep up with the
messages and the other maintenance tasks.

As far as file transfers go, the best way is to grab the files directly
with FTP then download them from your workspace. You can get FTP by mail
via DEC (I think dec.com, gatekeeper.dec.com, or some such) but such
transfers are done at night and are usually encoded and split. I use these
as a last resort since they are much slower and require much more fiddling.
(You have to manually strip the headers, merge the pieces together -- in order
-- then decode them. I can't remember the exact mail address for DEC, but
I think it's something like ftpmail@dec.com. There are a few others as well,
such as the one you mentioned.

No, I'd say you are doing it right -- there's not much you can get wrong
with Gopher since it's merely a point-and-shoot interface. It's definitely
a software problem but who's software has yet to be determined. I suspect
it could go either way (the FTP to Gopher transfer or Delphi) but have yet
to hear anything about it since I reported the problem.

   Chris,
       I don't know if you remember me, but I was the one that bought your
   NEC CD player at the Atlanta fest. The bad news is that I have been
   unable to get it to work. I am hopeing that you can shed some light
   on what I may be doing wrong.
       I currently have 1 hard drive and 1 floptical on the SCSI buss. The
   hard drive uses SCSI controller ID $00, and the floptical uses ID $02.
       This is on a 8 meg MM/1. I havn't gone with the MM/1a yet.

       The CD drive was set up to use SCSI ID $01, so I thought I was all
   set, so on my first attempt to hook it up, I just crimped a 50 pin
   connector on the SCSI ribbon cable, powered up, loaded the CD programs,
   and tried vcdp &. The program screen would come up but the access lights
   on the hard drive and floptical would come on and go into a state where
   the computer was locked up. I had seen that the CD drive had the switch
   set for internal termination, and thought that that might be the problem
   so I switched termination off. With termination OFF, the hard drive and
   floptical didn't lock up, but doing an access of the hard drive would
   take about 4 times longer than normal. The player program would come up
   but none of the functions would work. The buttons would click up and
   down but I didn't seem to be getting anything from the player. The QUIT
   button wouldn't work, the only way to get out was to shut off the computer.
       I thought that I might be having cable problems, so I ordered new
   connectors and cable, and when they showed up, I made a new SCSI cable,
   but I still had the same problem, the program didn't appear to be
   reading the CD, none of the pushbuttons did anything, and the hard drive
   access time was a whole lot longer than normal.
       I even disconnected the flopitical drive from the SCSI cable to see
   if that might be the problem, but still the same results.

       Do you have any ideas on what the problem might be ?

the best local CD-i support is being provided by a place called Jerry's
Audio and Video or something like that.

    Anyway, if you pick either of these titles up, let me know how you like
them.

     CD-i Coverage
     From: MREGC        To: ALL

To all of those interested in CD-i stuff, apparently, next Sunday at
sometime in the afternoon/evening there's going to be some kind of games
awards program on cable station WTBS Atlanta. I forget the name of the
program, something like Cyber something I think. It should be on around
8:00 pm Eastern time. In the commercials I've seen for this show, there are
quick screen shots of Caesar's World of Boxing, Voyeur, Escape from Cyber
City, and a version of 7th Guest that looked so clean it had to be the CD-i
version. I believe there's also prizes which viewers can win, one of which is
a CD-i player.

I'm not quite sure what the whole thing is about, but it looks interesting.

  Agreed... someone should inform the auther of any problems associated with
a product he or she puts out.
  I had to go way back to my early days of learning OS-9 to find a compatible
floppie for my system.  I had to find my copies on 40 track, double sided
disk.  And, since I have been booting from hard drive for years, I had to do
some real digging.  I did find them and copied the original SCF to my ramdisk
and did the required patch as requested in the docs that came with SHELL+
V2.2a.  When working on my utility, DScan, I had run into a problem where it
did not get rid of the small red text overlay window after pressing a key to
continue.  I hit the <BREAK> key to stop DScan.  I did not see the '.' on the
command line of the small window and type in "wr"-<ENTER> which cleans up the
whole screen back to default settings.  I got the infamous "ERROR 216".  That
was when I saw the '.'  I use no GUIs, so I do not care about mouse problems.
I do not even have a joystick hooked to this CoCo 3 I am on.
  I see that the people running NitrOS9 get an "even more extensively opt-
omized" SCF.  Why is this, I wonder?!  Would this be HD63B09EP specific by
any chance?  I just happen to have a 6309 in this machine, but, I do not have
NitrOS9.  Nor, do I even know where to get it.  Oh well!  See ya.

LONG LIVE OS-9! <FOREVER> ** In whatever form it is in!
