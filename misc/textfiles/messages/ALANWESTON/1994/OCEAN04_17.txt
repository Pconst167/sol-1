Paul,
     The same thing occured to me and I had to wait 6 months to confirm
it was automatic.  That is one smart clock chip in the MM/1.

(here is copy of msg. I sent on the Internet to you)
 
Boisy,
     I am haveing a few problems with my OSK UUCP.  I put a .mailrc file 
in the postmaster dir and that seems to work except when I call mailx or 
postnews or readnews I get an error #000:009 (readparam: illegal 
setonoff() value: 'pm' at line 4).
    I have been able to send a file and rcv a file from my UNIX host so
far but have not been able to set up the newgroups nor send a msg or
receive a msg.  Another error occurs when I call palm and call for
m)ail and try to send a msg To: , it wont take any address or name,
gives me a stack overflow and dumps me back to the login prompt.
    My biggest problem is understanding the varioous dir's needed and
what goes where.  I need some actual examples I guess.
    Other than that it seems to run well and calls out (uucico) nicely.
One other bug is that the Tsmon /t0& will only allow one call the first
thing of the day to the modem. Next time it seems to lock up the modem
although the lites are normal and is in the autoanswer mode. Rebooting,
changing modems, changing ports has no effect.
And yes I have the modem strings set correctly, same as I used for years 
on RiBBS.

Some clock chips are smart enough to do the change automatically.

All they do is look for the first Sunday in April, and make the change
then.

TTYL. Colin.

Gee.  What do people in the states or regions that decided not to go
with Daylight Savings Time do?  (For that matter, how about users outte
-er, outside--the US?)

If anyone is attempting to run 'tsmon /t0&' to a modem you may find the
modem sends result codes which locks up tsmon to the modem and wont let
it answer a call.  I found that all I had to do was init my modem to
turn off result codes.  My old Anchor 2400e Patriot uses ATQ1 for this.
Now to get back to debugging my UUCP stuff !

Hi, Warren.

You know what your tsmon problem sounds like? It sounds like you're being 
bitten by the serial port bug in /t0.

Try using /t3 or /t4, and see if you have the same problem. You could also try

running Guardian.

I don't think the stock TSMON logs callers. You'd have to get Carl Kreider's 
MTSMON package. It has caller logging, as I recall.
