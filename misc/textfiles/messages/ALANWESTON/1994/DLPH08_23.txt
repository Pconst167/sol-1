I was wondering if anyone has ever attempted to write a program to figure out
the best way to cut a 4 x 8 sheet of material? A p
A panel optimization program. I am a cabinetmaker but no programmer! I would
love to collaborate on such a project but all I could offer is a knowledge of
wood working and material sizes. I would be interested in knowing if anyone has
written anything like this in Basic09 or maybe C for the coco 3 w/512K? Thanks

        Hehe, I know, I have to get off my high horse. Just because I'm 4
   hours ahead of the west coast, I have this ego trip because I think
   I'm more Up-to-date or ahead of the times compared to the other time
   zones<grin>.

        Actually the whole reason I shedualed it at 10:00 was because of
   the west coasters. Granted, my eyes will probably start getting heavy
   by 10:30, it is the earliest I can schedual it consider it's only
   6:00pm out in California as Jim was mentioning. That's one of the
   reasons I like Sundays for Conferences. The thing with Sunday is
   people are usually with family during the day or still have day jobs
   then(such as Brother Jeremy :-) ), so you would only have to schedual
   it at night anyway. Btw, if you have interest in doing a Farna
   Software related conference(or any topic you can relate to actually)
   let me know.

        >>And I'd REALLY like to sit in on the Level II version 3 thing.
   Many OS-9 people think that Rick Ulland pretty much put that together

        I am pretty much in agreement, but I do think the package could
   use a bit of work<mostly in the installation procedure and such>. I
   think Rick was planning on doing an update on it, but probably hasn't
   had the chance, since he is probably devoting most of his energy to
   the hardware right now. Also, once the package is complete, be it his,
   or another one that could come out of the conferences, I would like to
   see it officially recognized as the new version, or standard package<I
   imagine the only way the OFFICIAL version number can be modified is
   through the company it is licensed to...Microware>. I could really
   care less about the source code right now, I'm more for getting it all
   together as Rick did, and then having it recognized by the UG,Vendors,
   and users.

Chris, I've sold just over 150 copies myself, and I'm pretty sure Rick has
sold at least half that many. A LOT of the buyers were old-time OS-9 users
who just wanted updates at first (they were also the most trouble! Wouldn't
follow directions and use the plain-jane Tandy disks with the auto-install
program!! ;> ). The old-timres were the first to point out that this was
the best practical way to "upgrade" the system in one fell swoop. Other
patches can be added to it pretty easy, and the source for the auto install
program comes with it.

If there are some other items that should be added, please let me know.
Bear in mind that ONLY patches that are pretty much universally useable/
accepted will be incorporated. Odd or specific hardware patches won't.
The only thing that has been added in the way of hardware is the option to
patch CC3Disk to read PC and DECB disks.

Maybe a conference on "PatchOS-9... the OS-9 upgrade?" could be scheduled?

Subj:  Amiga OS9

Hi All, I received the following summary from Digby Tarvin, the person who
ported OS9 to the Amiga.

---- Summary follows --

Firstly, let me quickly review the products available from Microware.
The initial 6809 product, which was available as level I or II
(the latter supporting an expanded memory model) has been discontinued.
Its successor, OS-9/68000, is available as either "Industrial" or
"Professional". Industrial OS-9 is Kernel and serial I/O only, and is
intended for imbedded systems. Professional is intended as a multi user
development system including everything in industrial, plus file system
and tape support, a full range of utilities and the Microware C compiler.
An earlier "Personal" OS-9 package intended for hobyists has unfortunately
been discontinued.

A variation on the above packages is required for use with 68020 or better
processors. This version is called OS-9/68020 and comes with a different
kernel and enhanced C compiler to allow access to the more powerful
instruction
set. The correct kernel must be used for the host CPU, but there is no
difference for application software. The OS-9/68020 versions cost about
50\% more than their 68000 counterparts.

Finally, Microware have released a kernel which has been re-coded in C,
called OS-9000. The main effect this has is to allow non Motorolla systems
to be supported. It does, however, require a more powerfull CPU. For example
a minimum 68020 for Motorolla or 386 for Intel platforms.

The Microware product that we have licenced is Professional
OS-9\/68000 Version 2\.4. We are attempting to keep the price at
US\$600.00 in line with Microwares price for the equivalent Atari product.
Unfortunately, even though this is quite a bit below the the recommended
retail price, it is expensive for hobyist use.

An OS-9/68020 version of our port has been tested on an A3000, but we
are waiting for some definite interest before comitting the money for a
licence. Consequently, I cannot quote an exact price at this stage.
We have not licensed the OS-9000 product yet as it could only be used on
a small subset of Amiga machines (those with 68020 or better processors),
and the 68000 product is still better supported (new products are usually
available for OS-9/68000 before OS-9000).
It is also quite a bit more expensive, so it will probably wait
till there is some evidence of demand.

We use the system in house on A1000, A2000 and A3000. It has also been used
at Microware on A500s.

It is a bit difficult to summarise the technical details in a couple of pages,
but I would be happy to answer any specific questions you may have about the
implementation or support for specific disk controllers and other hardware.

As a very brief outline, the system takes over the Amiga completely so
it retains its realtime qualities and performs like a very standard OS-9
environment. It requires no rom replacement or other hardware modification,
so switching between OS-9 and Amigados (or any other operating system)
requires only a re-boot. The Amiga display is supported as a colour text
terminal with customizable emulation and font module support.
It also supports multiple virtual screens much like that provided by
Amiga Unix.

Several graphical environments are available for OS-9, including Rave, X11,
gwindows and MGR. However these are not currently supported for the Amiga
display.

We are looking at these but the main problem is the substantial price
increase that would result and of course deciding on the most appropriate
choice. Rave would allow CDI application compatibility which may be of
interest to hobbyists and developers, X11 of course provides increased
UNIX workstation compatibility, and gwindows/MGR a Mac style operating
environment. A company in Switzerland have volunteered to undertake
a port of MGR which I will be very interested to see.

To summarise some answers to some common questions:
 Operating System Vers: Professional OS-9/68000 V2.4
 Booting:               Can boot from any floppy or hard disk
                        OS9 Kickstart may be used on A1000 to gain
                        an extra 256K of write-protectable ram.
                        Supported by AmigaDOS
 Terminals:             VT100 emulation on amiga display
                        Full support for amiga serial port
                        Driver for ASGD serial card available
                        Commodore A2232 driver under development
 Disks:                 Internal floppy drive supported
                        Primary format is amiga standard encoding
                        OS-9 Universal format supported for
                        compatibility
                        Driver for A2090 HD available
                        Driver for A2091/A3000/A590 HD available soon
                        (new SCSI driver technology will support SCSI tape
                        disk etc)
 Amiga Utilities:       AmigaDOS file system access utility
                        Convert amiga font files to OS9 font modules

 SSM:                   SSM may be used when hardware supports it.

 Price:                 US$600.00

We are currenty updating our licence to include the new Microware
'Ultra C' Ansi C compiler technology.
This will add about US$150.00 to the price of a license. The compiler
if purchased separately from Microware will be priced at US$1,300.
This would seem like a good buy for professional users, but does
increase the entry cost for hobyists. I would be interested in any
thoughts you may have on this.

Thank you again for your enquiry. I hope this information is of some
assistance.

        Hi again Mike. The OS-9 Users Group CAN provide a great deal of
   support for Level II users, but just like all other users, it depends
   on how active the community is. If we all sit back and expect everyone
   else to do things for us, then we can just lock the door on the UG,
   BUT if we all pitch in, even just little things, I believe we can make
   a big difference. I say let's go for it and see how long we can our
   'dead' OS. Level II is officially Dead as far as far as sales are
   concernced, since it isn't sold no more, but that doesn't mean we
   shouldn't support it. The only thing that can keep the Coco and OS-9
   from a decent prosperity is us. That's why I'm doing the conference,
   as well as TRYING to do some other things. While I'm not the greatest
   programmer nor am I really an OS-9 guru( I can help some newcomers in
   OS-9 but I can't promise more than that yet), I would like to be able
   to say I did more than just send a $25 Check to the UG. Not that
   there's nothing in it for me granted. I really treat this as a real
   learning experience for me, and I think I will gain knowledge that
   will definately come in handy when I'm out there in the real world,
   hopefully working with OS-9. It's fun and educational, just like
   school was<Big Grin>.

   I've been trying to find out, , if th OSUG actually supports OS Level II
 any more,, or if it's primarily OSK?
  all I've heard is if enough people join and ask foro OS level II support
 they will.  But theoretically that <g> would be true even if it were a
 C-64 group.   Though it really happening is slim.
  Other then 6 newsletters per year foro twenty five dollars (whatta deal),,
 what can an OS level II user expect to receive in support for his CoCo?
  Just asking,, Terry Simons

Welp, seeing that the UG Bylaws provide specifically for a V.P. of OS-9/6809
for the users that are interested in "CoCo" OS-9, I would say that definately
is support for OS-9 Level II.

What to expect from the UG (regardless of what "flavor" of OS-9 you use) is
dependant on how much the members support the Group. The Officers cannot
do everything, input, and outright legwork is needed from the membership.

     I've been having some dialog with the UG officers to answer some of the
same questions you have about the UG. What I have found is that there is
not much communication going on in a meaningful way. We can change that
(all you Level II users)! My contact with the officers, even though I'm not
a member has put me in touch with people that can help me and have similar
levels of knowledge. The UG is soliciting input from the Coco community
and all OS9 users (OSK and OS9)
I believe they can act as a centralized body to connect members together
whether it's to learn how to build a boot disk or see if someone is
working on a program similar to yours. The UG is ideally positioned to
nurture colabrative efforts by various UG members. I mentioned that I
am having a tough time because I can't get any of the out of print refereneces
Starting OS9 and possibly Kevin Ds
Inside OS9 back into circulation. Support from all Level II users is what
is needed to create a UG that supports us. Really, the UG is in a position
to allow us to help each other in a more effectove way. I plan to join
soon. I STRONGLY encourage any Level II user to submit your ideas to the
OS9UG. I have been posting some similar info on the Cocolist. Some of the
 are on-line here and are all willing to listen to your ideas. We've been
complaining because we don't hear from them. They are complaining that they
never
hear from us. Let's all quit complaining and start talking. I think you'll find
there are some meaningful projects we can all push to start. The UG is
truly what the OS9 community makes it.

     RE: OS-9 Live (Re: Msg 89370)
     From: CPERRAULT    To: MROWEN01

        Mike, you are similar to me, in that while I do want to upgrade
   to one or more of the OSK machines(boy am I ambitious<G> ) I would
   like to understand more about level II while waiting. I still plan on
   learning Level II and using it even after I go OSK, simply for the fun
   of it. One thing I don't think you need to worry about is, you don't
   necessarily need to understand Level II in order to use OSK
   effectively. As you know you will get much more power out of OSK, and
   also, you can probably now count on more applications<the Coco would
   still have the quantity lead if 90% of the vendors didn't go out of
   business taking their product line with them.>, and the applications
   are of higher quality, with that aspect improving with time. And most
   importantly, OSK is STILL SUPPORTED by Microware and the businesses
   who provide it(Delmar,FHL, Blackhawk etc...). This means that Unlike
   the Coco, where due to Tandy's lack of support, we HAD to hack the
   thing to bits and understand the innards to make it reach it's
   potential, hacking on the OSK machines is an option, and not a
   requirement. You will find it is a better programing environment, and
   a better software environment, where you don't have to have 15
   different bootdisks, and the patches are minimal. As a matter of fact,
   from what I understand, and someone please correct me if I'm wrong,
   any patches for OSK are mostly for cosmetic purposes and really aren't
   required to run any of the commercial programs. I would put OSK
   machines more in the PC category as far as ease of use is concerned
   compared to the Coco, and consider it easier to use than Dos(ever try
   comparing Dos and OS9 pathlists? There is none<G>). Not that it
   matters to the Dos community since most probably never realize an OS
   is even there, but it is of value to those here considering jumping to
   a clone. The bottom line is, if you want to upgrade to OSK, and have
   the money, don't hesitate due to any lack of understanding Level II.
   It really isn't that expensive to go OSK either. The MM/1 is priced
   competitively with the 386 machines, which is is pretty low<since we
   are a much less lower volume market>, and Delmar's and Fhl's 68020
   systems only average about $2000.00 to $2500.00 I think, depending on
   what you get with it. It sounds expensive to a lot of people, but this
   is a Unix oriented system, and thus the market reflects that. Besides,
   if I hear one more Coco user complain because he can't find a fully
   loaded osk system for under $500.00 ....<Big ugly Grin>

Hang in there, Mike.  I think you can have several years of good service with
the CoCo.  To be quite frank, I still find some functions remain a little
smoother with the CoCo than with OSK.  OSK is still developing on a user level
 - well, so is the CoCo, I suppose but it's had more time.

Still, as James said, when it comes to some of the raw crunching functions,
zipping/unzipping files, compiling huge C code, etc, then when I move over
to the CoCo, it *DOES* seem a little slow.  However, there's a familiarity
there that is hard to get away from.

Right.  If you are going to program, most of what you learn under L-2
will carry right over, but if you are going to be basically a user, then
this knowledge is not necessary.

Good point.  This is one big aspect in my decision to upgrade.  I think
it is only realistic to face the fact that someday, there will be an end
to the road for the CoCo.  However, there's still plenty going on, and
I believe if one really wants to, he can hold out for several years.

Correct again.  I got my system already set up, but so far as I know, it
is totally stock M-Ware.  Of course, I reckon the drivers are specific to
my machine.  Then, too, I'm sure there are bugs still there, but I'm sure
you can never find an OS that is TOTALLY 100% bug-free.

To be quite frank, I'm sure it would be reasonable to expect to have to
spend probably $2000 for ANY system to be totally self-sufficient.  I mean
with its own monitor, a hard drive (you should have at least 200Meg).
The real beauty of all these systems is that you CAN, if you want to, first
set them up as terminal systems - no monitor, keyboard or even HD if you
Really want to keep initial costs down.  You can hook your CoCo to one of
the serial ports and get to work.

The run time sculptor is everything but the compiler. So if you did not have
compiled programs to run it would be useless. Well not entirely. The menu part

compiled. If you

     You've got a rare drive I guess. You may want to check the numbers again.
I can't find much on Olivetti drives; However, I have some info on the 662/12.
Not that it will help you but maybe a bit. The 662/12 is a 20MB drive with
4 heads 612 cylinders, it's an MFM drive, 17 sectors and is a half height
form factor. All of the Olivetti drives I have reference to are ALL MFM
drives so you should be able to use the 563/12 on a Coco. You could try
612 cy;inders and expect 20 Meg of space. All of their 10MB drive had a /11
and the 20MB have a /12. If anyone else here can help more please do so.
Sorry I couldn't be more exact! :(

Mike, could you tell me what the jumpers are for drive number selection on
a Connor CP2040? This is a SCSI drive. I got it with no jumpers installed, and
assumed it was set for device 0. I'm having some trouble getting the driver
set up, and want to verify this if possible. I don't have any HD references
available here!

   I don't have anything exact on the Conner CP2040. I have lots of info on
heads, cyliders, etc. Controllers are more specialized. Most SCSI drives
have either a dual row of jumper pins or a big matrix of jumpers. Some
also have DIP switches. It may help if you tell me how many pins you have.
No jumpers is usually address 0. There is also a SCSI parity jumper on some
drives. This may be the problem. The most common layout I've seen is :

o     o     o     o     o
                   o     o     o     o     o

 5     4     3     2    1



1,2, &3 are address jumpers (binary 0-7). Jumper 4 is parity enable/disable.
5 is usually not used. Sometimes 4 is not used and 5 is a parity jumper. The
Hitachi, Seagate, Miniscribe, and Fujitsu SCSI drives follow this pattern
in one fashion or another. Some have a sixth jumper for diagnostics. This
may not help, but it's what I have on SCSI drives. I mostly have MFM/RLL
specs. Good Luck!

     Gone temporarily
     From: JOELHEGBERG  To: ALL

This is just a quick note.  Any mail sent to me may not get a reply for
a couple days, depending on the local SprintNet node (actually phone
connections).  The problem is due to a very bad storm that hit DeKalb
yesterday (at least 4 funnel clouds sighted, 2 touched down on my side
of town).  There really isn't lots of damage...  trees down and snapped
telephone poles, downed power lines, streets littered with branches and
such.  The SprintNet connection is very sporadic now as repairs go
underway, and power will be out for a bit tomorrow as they try to
restore power to the South East side of town and to right the telephone
poles.

I was at work when the storm hit (I work at a restaurant to get me
through college) and was safe inside the store's cooler while one of the
tornadoes passed by, while others hid under the tables.  (I'm not sure
why they did that...  really no protection and there are about 10 huge
glass windows in the main room, which would really cause some injuries
if they were blown in!)

I'm connecting to Delphi via the local University using a friend's
system, but won't be on again until SprintNet comes back up, so talk to
everyone shortly!

A few friends of mine went chasing after the storm and got to see one of
the tornadoes... said it was quite weird, sort of inverted being skinny
close to the clouds and thicker near the ground.  They also were
concerned about a big cloud over their heads that looked like an
"eye"... you storm chasers are nuts... <g>

     64K or not 64K..
     From: DIGIGRADE    To: ALL


     Hi all,

   I just bought a Color Computer 2 at a yard sale. I noticed the warranty
sticker was replaced and wondered if it was a 64K machine. Having nothing but
a composite monitor at the time I couldn't do a ?MEM. I opened it up and there
is a foil covered board, inverted, on plastic sand-offs right next to the ROM
port.
It has all kinds of things (the extra board) stuck on it. There are alot of
empty chip "areas" on the motherboard. I never remembered my 16K Color Computer
looking bare like that. Is this a 64K upgrade I'm looking at?


    Thanks

That one sounds like a 64k upgraded one! typing Free will only give you 32k
actualy <21 or 22k> the upper memory is NOT recognized by BASIC.....
There was a CoCo II that I know of <not many of em!> that to be upgraded to
64k another board had to be installed,and the old chips removed<shades of the
 CoCo-3> That one was a weird oddball unit...if memory serves me !!! I had
heard of this one ,but never seen one! MartyGoodman might be able to put more
light on this! What we used to do with the 64k was to put other stuff into the
upper 32k with RSDOS...being able to add other goddies was fun! ADOS was one!
now it is on the CoCo-3.....in an extended format! ARRRR! Those were the days!

If this is a 26-3134A or 26-3136A, or same numbers with "B", then it is possible

that it was indeed upgraded with a plug-in board to 64K. The board would have 8
4164 chips on it. It is a "B" model if there are empty chip locations. These
were for 4164 chips (or sockets). This machine could be upgraded by using those
blank locations, the plug-in board, or replacing the two 4416 chips with
two 4464 chips. Sounds likr that might be what you have. Note that if it IS
a plug-in board upgrade, it is RARE!!
Most that came as 64K models had 4164s soldered to the board, and 16Ks came with

a pair of 4416s. Most upgrades were with 4464s, with very few of the boards
being used.

My first CoCo was a CoCo 2, 26-3136B, 16K Extended.  I think I paid

a bit naive about the internals of the CoCo.  I often wish I still had
that old CoCo, since it was my very first one.

I found a 26-3136B a while back, but it had the 8 4164's soldered in

Yes.  You could make one target in a makefile with multiple targets by
saying:

make <target>

I do it all the time with the UUCP package.  If I'm working on one program,
I don't want make to attempt to make everything before it, so adding
the target to the command line makes things move much quicker.

Just saw an interesting release over on CIS.  There's apparently
a new MM1 game that will be available starting 8/25 called
Gold Runner 2000.  Sounds interesting from the description.

I would guess the announcement will be up here shortly.

Yes, vgint and windint can coexist.  I have both in my OS9Boot.  You need
VDGInt if you need the 32-col screen, also, several games (Flightsim,
Kings Quest, etc) use VDGInt.  This is because VDGInt, although hogging
more memory for a window, updates faster.

VDGInt doesn't have the higher-level windowing capabilities of GRFInt, and
WindInt can be considered an upgrade, I suppose, for GrfInt.  WindInt
contains the native functions needed for Multi-View.

Any driver, descriptor, or any other system module you need more than on
extremely *RARE* occasions SHOULD be in OS9Boot, since here, they
utilize memory much better.

You also get this error if you don't have enough memory in your 64-K

Pretty much a standard hack. What it does is bypasses the selector switch
on the front of the mpi for irq's only. The rest of the system siftware
(software) takes care of the polling for the source of the irq, but if the
irq can't get past the slot selection logic in the mpi, there is no effective
irq.  The character gets lost, often several, as in up to 4 if your interface
speed is 2400 because conceivably 4 chars could come in since the last time
the clock module initiated an irq scan at its 60 per second. Chances for 4
misses are awfully slim, but 1,2,3 are rather common. You get almost exactly
the same effect from not using the latest clock modules also, since those
before Edition 9 do not handle the toggling of the gime chips irq registers
correctly. So get yourself the proper version of the edition 9 clock for
your hardware configuration, they are available here in the data base.
Between the two fixes, and the latest versions of sacia to replace aciapak.dr,
there will not be any lost characters even at a 9600 baud coco<->modem rate.
Your ability to run at 9600 will be determined by your modem. If it autobauds
for those rates above 2400, then run the interface at 9600, the modem will
down-translate to the 2400 baud phone line most of us have to use to call
this service.

Thanx Gene, I'll do the wiring aspect asap. I have Ed#9 already and I believe

     From: WDTV5        To: ALAIN1155

In scanning the rest of the replies, it appears that most of what I could
tell has already been suggested. I don't have much experience in writing
code for rma as a direct asm.source code, what I do is stop the compiler's
output at either the .a or .o stages and then look the assembly code the
compiler has generated over to see if it could be improved upon.  Not a lot
as a general rule, but the zmodem you are using if its 3.24 is about 10%
faster because I optimised one function that way. If you don't have the
compiler, its a lot harder I'd think. I expect, and I've seen many messages
here regarding it, that the compiler is still available from Tandy's Special
Order Software. Probably as replacement disks only, or without the manuals.
The manual itself, other than describbing some things the compiler doesn't
do, and giving a few templates for the lib calls, really isn't a large
loss. See WaldenBooks of C reference manuals. s/b for, not of. With the
latest front ends for the compiler, its pretty close to 'ansi' C now. Those
front ends are: replace the module "c.prep" with the c_prep from the database
file cprep19.lzh, and get a copy of CC_2_5_2, the newer executive that lets
you use Vaugn Cato's latest "ansifront". Between those 3 items, this compiler
is now as close to being a fully ansi compliant compiler as it will ever get.
Unless of course Vaugn surprises us some more.
Cheers, Gene

OS-9 on a CoCo2 with 64K was pretty rough. If you are serious about learning
some OS-9, you really need a CoCo3 with 512K. Complete systems can be bought
for around $300 with an RGB monitor. You can learn a lot on the CoCo 2
if you already have disk drives though, but Level I (for 64K) is very limited.

That's a subjective matter, but put it this way: on the CoCo 2, which you
haven't looked at for years, a fellow has run a BBS and had a caller on
while he was assembling some code--not bad multitasking for a computer
with only 64K of memory.  For several years I used a CoCo 3 under OS-9,
initially with a couple of 720K floppy drives and eventually with a hard
drive added, and had a windowing multitasking system going comfortably
with 512K RAM (this despite an infamous Bill Gates statement that one
can't really multitask with less than 4 Mbytes of RAM).  It's possible to
run a CoCo 3 with 2 Mbytes of RAM, but that's almost more RAM than one
knows what to do with, aside from running a large RAM disk and having
lots of stuff loaded into memory so that it's instantly available to run.

I'm still using OS-9 now, but it's OS-9/68000, on a 68340 running at
about 15 MHz with eight megabytes of RAM and a 100 Mbyte SCSI hard drive
that I'm thinking of replacing with a larger drive.  The windowing is
a superset of that on the CoCo 3, the operating system is enough like
OS-9/6809 that making the move was trivial.

Trial and error... that is how I learned most of what I know about Delpi
(and many other things) I did spend a lot of time on a VAX/VMS system
(which is what Delphi is) when I was at collage, so I learned a bit about
system internals that arn't really documented in the Delphi info.

OSTerms VT-100 mode might not be quite up to snuff for using the full screen
mode. KBcom is much more capable in that respect...

Hi, Stephen -

If you are planning to set it up using the port of GNU 'vh' (vh_1.4.lzh)
that was ported by Andrzej Kotanski, you will probably want to check
the code for a busy loop, insert a "tsleep(x);", and recompile.  Colin
used it to provide online access to the Northern Xposure catalog at the
Chicago fest, and we found that all the other processes became glacial...
not something you will want when trying to demonstrate how well OS-9
multitasks <g>.

     SCSI.cables
     From: HAWKSOFT     To: ALL

Hi Folks!

   I have had a few requests regarding the nature of SCSI cables for the
external CDRom Drives. Here is the scoop on how I made mine:

  Three items are required. You need a 50 pin IDC plug (connects to the SCSI
connectors on your existing SCSI cable), a DB25 female (innie?) connector
(connects to the DB25 male <outie?> on the cable supplied w/ CDRom), and 2
feet of 50 conductor ribbon cable.

  First, crimp the 50 pin IDC plug to one end of the ribbon cable. Match pin
#1 of the cable (usually a red stripe) to pin #1 of the connector (usually
has a small arrow-head pointing to it).

  Second, at the other end of the ribbon cable, separate all 50 wires of the
cable for about two inches.  (I'll whistle while I wait <g>.)

  Third, cut off all of the odd numbered wires from the ribbon cable.
(be careful!)

  Fourth, solder (or crimp, depending on the type DB25 you have) the wires
of the ribbon cable to the DB25 as follows.

I also have one of those babies hooked to my MM/1... They can emulate
about 3 different terminal types (all old, unfortunately).  I have yet
to get a termcap entry working for it.  I do have one for "adm3a"
emulation, but it doesn't seem to work completely, either.

Whew!,
I don't remember the question number but I have been
using a Zoom 28.8kbps modem (v.FC) for a while.  It
DOES require hardware handshakingto achieve any reasonable
throughput, which I believe you will find true for all
of the newer modems.  I run the Kix\30 at 38.4 or 19.2k.
One really needs 57.6k or higher to effectively use the
power of one of these!  I, too am still at OSK 2.3, a sore
point for sure!  IS FHL/Hazelwood still in business?

Can somebody please give me some info on how to contact Northern Xposure?
I have heard that they sell Nitros-9, and I need it to break the "4800 Baud
Barrier".
