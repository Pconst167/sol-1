     Allen Huffman's Maze Demo

        I recently downloaded Allen Huffmans Maze demo which is a
   generator to make developing maze style games easier. The first thing
   that popped in my head was..."Boy would it be nice to have a Dungeons
   of Daggorath part 3, this time on OS-9". Really, the demo looks neat,
   and I think the Coco is due for another sequel to perhaps the greatest
   game Tandy ever made for the Coco. :-)

     MM/1 System For Sale
     From: ERNIEWITHERS To: ALL

If anyone's interested, I will have my 3 meg. MM/1 Extended system for sale
at the Atlanta Fest. The system is housed in an IMS case/power supply and
includes one 3-1/2" high density floppy drive, /t3, Microware manuals, the
HD boot ROMS (though I always have to boot from floppy to get a successful
boot), and a genuine Logitech Series 9 mouse. Currently installed on the
system is a 245 meg MAXTOR hard drive. I don't really want to sell the hard
drive but I could if you want it. Included is the MM/1 Technical Manual,
VED/68000 2.0, VPRINT, VMAIL, BGFX, Mike Haaland's Desktop, EthaGUI, DynaStar,
DynaForm, Write Right, Zapper, FBU from FHL, Variations of Solitaire from
ColorSystems, and TasCom from CoCoPro. All software includes original disks
and manuals. If you want the hard drive, it contains many, many public domain
utilities and programs for OSK and the MM/1.

I also have several different OS9/6809 programs and utilities for sale.
Included are ColorWare's DataMaster with update for Level II and DynaMite+
disassembler for OS9, FLEX, and RSDOS. I used DynaMite many years ago to
disassemble OS9 Profile and "repair" the check for a Color Computer because
I was using a WordPak II and the stock program wouldn't run. I was also
able to disassemble the Thexeder ROM pak and patch it to run from disk.

Though I won't be using OS9/68000 any longer, I will still be playing around
with OS-9000 on one of the '486 machines I own.

If you are interested in buying the system, leave me EMail. If I don't get
any responses, I probably won't be going to the 'fest.

Mark, the MM/1 has VGA range resolution.  720 x 540.   in 256 colors.
(actually, it is considered by some to be low-range SVGA.)

James,
  I am ALMOST certain that rz (same version and CRC) has done that for
me when downloading.  Some of those UNIX types love to put hyphens
in filenames.  It used to drive me (and "tar") nuts when they stashed
a couple "illegal" names in the middle of a tar archive too, but
"gtar" handles that now.

Yes I have, but years back. And only dbl sided, no plated thru holes stuffs.
Did some nice work at the time, but that was in the '60's! I have a helper
who does that stuffs for me now, at about the same level of expertise most
of the time. Good enough for onzies-tenzies type stuff we need at the
station now. I used 4x artwork, positive resist that we sprayed and dried
ourselves, and an old DEA spray etcher with ferric chloride. Super precise
work at the time, but production lines in taiwan beat it now in 100k piece

The problem is the lack of hardware handshking I expect. First, wire ALL
the mpi sockets together at pin 8 to carry the IRQ's thru. Then, it may be
that the converted modem pack doesn't have all the signals. They can be
juryrigged in if you can get to somebody who has a schematic for the deluxe
232 pack, just dup anything thats not in yours. Minimum connections are to
pins 2-3-4-5-6-7-8-20. Check the schematic for names and functions.
