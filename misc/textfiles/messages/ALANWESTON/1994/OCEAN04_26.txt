Thanks for your help; I've captured your message to me and I'll gather
all the info together offline to make sure I don't skip over any of the
stuff you've asked for.  Thanks again.

Here goes.  I'm connected using laterm, after entering the command by
hand that ladial should be using given the dial.sys I have.
 
I'm using /t3.  xmode shows type=80 baud=38400 xon=0 xoff=0 tabc=0, and
the rest is pretty much the usual.  Hang on, let's try a little cutting
and pasting...
 
noupc bsb bsl echo lf null=0 nopause pag=24 bsp=08 del=18 eor=0D
eof=1B reprint=04 dup=01 psc=17 abort=03 quit=05 bse=08 bell=07
type=80 baud=38400 xon=00 xoff=00 tabc=00 tabs=4
 
The strings are the same as those I use with OSTerm.

I hope (and really think) this will be the last fix (until (and if) I
upgrade it.  V. 1.9 is the latest version - this one HAS been tested by
me.  Try it and see what results you get.

BHE has shipped it's first MM/1.   Shipping time is still dependent
on receipt of boards ala IMS - in other words, pretty delayed.   We
will be turning all profits back into inventory though, so unlike 
IMS we expect to be shipping within 30 days by the end of this year.
(End of July, if possible!).   Our special offer is over.  The systems
advertised are still available, but not at the discounted price.
 
Please direct inquiries for sales to an authorized reseller or

Bob van der Poel has been monitoring our recent discussions about the
MM/1 clock, and forwarded the following to me on Internet:

Date:        Sun, 24 Apr 1994 13:50:38 -0400

Subject: Clocks

I saw some chatter on Fido about the DST stuff in the mm/1 clock.
That feature can be toggled on/off. Here is a B09 program which
does just that.

 PROCEDURE Clock_DST_toggle
 
 (* This will toggle the daylight saving time auto-adjust flag on the
 (* MC14681A (Dallas Semi DS1287). The addesses used here are for a
 (* MM/1 computer -- other systems may use different addressing.
 
 (* By Bob van der Poel,  92/10/16
 
 DIM Clock_Sel,Clock_data:INTEGER
 DIM Value:BYTE
 
 Clock_Sel=$e00200+1
 Clock_data=$e00200+3
 
 (* Get the current value in clock REGISTER B. We are interested in Bit 0.
 (* We toggle the value of Bit 0.
 
 POKE Clock_Sel,11
 v=PEEK(Clock_data)
 IF LAND(v,1)=1 THEN
 v=LAND(v,126)
 ELSE v=LOR(v,1)
 ENDIF
 
 (* Now put the new value in the clock. Then we get it back and do our
 (* reporting...
 
 POKE Clock_Sel,11
 POKE Clock_data,v
 
 POKE Clock_Sel,11
 v=PEEK(Clock_data)
 
 PRINT "Daylight savings time adjustment ";
 IF LAND(v,1)=0 THEN
 PRINT "NOT ";
 ENDIF
 PRINT "enabled."

Thanks, Bob!

TTYL. Colin.

Oh, I should mention that Bob van der Poel has read-only
access to Fido, so please don't try sending him messages.

Thanks. Colin.

Colin,
     Bob calls my BBS about 2 times a month and he can post on any echo
but usually does a quick capture of new mail and logs off.  Saves on LD
costs.  So if he sees something worth replying to he will just send from 
his Compuserve account providing the addressee has an internet number.
But he can post on here if he has to.
