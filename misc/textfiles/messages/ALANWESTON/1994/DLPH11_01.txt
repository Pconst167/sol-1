Does anyone have a dithering algorithm? preferably non-coco/OS9 specific.
any language is ok with me... thanks in advance...

 Mike,

 > Does anyone have a dithering algorithm?

 There are quite a few dithering algorithms and variants available.  Some
 of the books on graphics cover the subject.  'Bit-Mapped Graphics' by Steve
 Rimmer ISBN 0-8306-3558-0 from Windcrest Books (TAB Books) has a chapter on
 dithering.  Covers some of the algorithms and provides C code examples.
 Additional info is available from Rimmer's second book, 'Supercharged
 Bitmapped Graphics', ISBN 0-8306-3788-5, same publisher.  The second book
 includes a disk (MSDOS) with the code examples.  You will probably find more
 information in past issues of C-Users Journal and Dr Dobbs Journal.  Don't
 forget INTERNET; using Gopher, you can get a wealth of sources.

     RE: Powerboost v.2.0 (Re: Msg 90481)
     From: WDTV5        To: NEALSTEWARD (NR)

Hi Neal; Give my version of Ram a try, its self initializing (as in don't
format it, doesn't need it).
I wrote (or re-wrote) it because I got tired of having the C compiler
puke at either ansifront or c.pass1 because the original would de-initialize
itself when c.prep closed out the file it just wrote. This on won't lose
the compilers output.  I have 2 megs here, and there is not any 6309 specific
codes in it alltho I do have Nitros9 here myself. You can set this one to
any memory size you want, mine is currently set at about a meg. You can
nge the size if ya want, but to control fragmentation, its
best to change it to the size you want with dmode (modify the sct value)
before opening the first file to it.
Have fun, its here in the database, under system I think, search on ram
and grab the newest one. Cheers, Gene Heskett

Humm, there I go again, talking to myself! Anyway, NEALSTEWARD I told
you WRONG! I got to thinkin after I wrote that, and figured I had better
check my code again for 6809 compatibility. 'tain't!!! Not only did I
use several of the 16 bit shift commands which would be fixable easily,
but I also used one of the new 6309 registers.  Thats not easily worked
around without a more major re-write.  Therefore I have to say that
this code, while not requireing the Native mode patches, does require
a genuine HD63B09EP to run on. So I made a booboo! It's Halloween.
Sorry all who havn't yet put on in.  Get one, its well worth the effort
to install it even if only to cool the coco off since it runs at room
tempurature, no heat at all.
Cheers, Gene

Humm, thids sounds like maybe yur using the older clock module. I used to
have problems that way till I started using at least the Edition 9 clocks.
Do you have the multipack sockets all strapped at pin 8? Only one thing
bothers me, you said "exactly 3". If it was the clock, it should oughta be
1, 2 or 3 on a random basis at 2400 baud.  Sounds like the clock, but doesn't
quite totally fit the expected symptoms. Is there any more you can tell us?

    Yep, done something like that too. Yea, I remember, I typed rz to start
Delphi's end. I'm glad Linkup has auto z detect. Strangely, it doesn't
_allways_ work. It isn't all that hard to point, click, and start it manual.

 VIS is a consumer product similar to the Phillips CD-i machines. However,
it uses (used?) MS-DOS (ugh!) type CD discs and (I'm told) runs Windows NT
(ugh ugh!!) for a operating system.

Thanx for the reply.  I can't afford even the base $400 for the OSK machine.
Not to mention, making an attempt to sell my CoCo 3 system.  I'm not about

conditions that might even put the MM/1 under and would definitely put the IBM
under.  Besides that, why should I fix that which need not be fixed.  Would
you and/or your group consider releasing the source code for IFF/SND files
to someone still of the CoCo III group for conversion?  Or maybe provide
the important clues to develope our own?

Thanx again

Can you provide me with OS9 Level II Play command line arguments?

I have several versions of Play distributed in archive as play3, play4,

I'd really appreciate any additional help you could provide.

Well, I guess I started it.  Somebody mentioned "Road Rash", and
it reminded me of an unplanned high-speed dismount from a motor-
cycle many years ago.  It seems a lot of others had similar memories
and comments.

This is indeed the OS9 discussion area,  BUT it is also a gathering
of friends, and we often wander off the original subject now and
then.

I plead guilty, Mr Thread Policeman, sir, slap the cuffs on --

I ahve NEVER riden in the dirt!~ Well, you can't really count dirt roads and
some hard-packed trails through the woods ("tractor roads" as we called them
mostly) on a street/trail 125 my brother once had. It was more street than
trail anyway... not like the street legal enduros they make now.. no where
NEAR that kind of ground clearance! Was made for rough roads and some trails,
but not all-out dirt!!

Larry, We may be in the same boat. My MM1 has a WD33c93-PL SCSI
chip. The VCDP player will not work with it. A WD33c93-A (revision
A) is required. Chris will know more but Karl Krieder tells me the
scsi_mm1d scsi routines require the A revision. Ray Patterson is
chasing down I/O probelms associated with WD33c93 chip and hopes
to have some insights in a couple of weeks.

     Hmm, this is just the same thing with my CD-ROM Drive (same make &

Has anyone here managed to compile Palm for OSK on an MM1 with the
stock C compiler?  I've tried but can't get it to work.  It appears that
several non-standard string functions are used - namely strtok, strchr, er,
that's it.  Also, _environ seems to be a problem.

Any hints/help greatly appreciated.

Dear Forum Members,

I am pleased to announce that as of today, Monday, October 31, 1994, a group at
Philips Interactive Media in Los Angeles is responsible for all support of
Philips Media CD-i and CD-ROM software products in the United States. (Those
outside the US should obtain support from the Philips organization in the local
country.)  The telephone number for this group is 800 340 7888; this is the
number that will be on software packaging in the US from now on.

This new group is comprised of experienced CD-i software support personnel, a
PIMA product test veteran and some new employees. We are able to answer gneral
consumer questions about CD-i, about specific titles in both CD-i and CD-ROM
formats, about title availability, and we can take orders, and give gameplay
hints. We can also send an information package to prospective developers.

Phone hours for the new software support group are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. M, T, W,
and F; 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, Pacific
Time.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions about US phone support
for Philips CD-i and CD-ROM titles.

We look forward to supporting our CIS forum friends,

Lucy Lediaev
Director, Customer Support
Philips Interactive Media

P.S. CD-I hardware and accessory support is available from Philips Consumer
     Electronics at 800 531 0039.
