An example to demonstrate that the proper searching needs to be done is
the case of the Oblique-Triad library of games:  With the demise of
Rainbow and its advertising, most folks probably assumed that the
software was no longer available.

Of course, when Colin McKay contacted them before Atlanta Fest '93, he
found that they had existing stock, but had lost their marketing channel.
Colin arranged for Northern Xposure to become their distributor, and the
software is now advertised in 'the world of 68' micros', as well as
mailout catalogs, etc.

You need to replace the clock module in your new boot file to correct the
problem with supercomm. Matt had the same problem and figured it out. Contact
him for the necessary modules for KQ3, LSL, FSII, and the new clock.

 From the most recent OS9 Underground I found the add. It is said here to be
may 21 and 22. This is the Chicago fest
  In the New Discoveries section it is also announced that the fourth annual
Pacific Northwest CocoFest will be taking place pm on
 June 24 and 25. I haven't much more about this one as of late, but it
 says you can contact Donald Zimmerman at (206) 871-6335 for details.
 I imagine there is probably more talk about this on Fido, but I haven't read
much there for a while now.

DATELINE: March 2, 1994

    This is the second year that GLENSIDE Color Computer Club is UNDERtaking
the sponsorship, planning, and execution of the Chicago-area held CoCoFEST!
Last year brought 30-plus exhibitors to the show, including Microware, the
developers of OS-9, which is proving to be the heart of the hard-core CoCo
enthusiasts.  Disk Extended Color BASIC programs and programmers were also
highly visible, as they should be, being the operating system of machine, out
of the box.  We were further excited that so many exhibitors chose the FEST!
to present their wares for the OS9-68000 systems, and we further hope to
garner their presence this year, again.
    This year, GLENSIDE is officially announcing that tickets for the FEST!
will be discounted by the amount of $5.00 for students between the ages of 6
to 16, when accompanied by an adult, and that children 5 years old and under
will be admitted free of charge.
    As of this writing, there are twelve official exhibitors.  They are:

        1)  Barsoft, Dave Barnes
        2)  ColorSystems, Zack Sessions
        3)  DELMAR, Ed Gressick
        4)  Hawksoft, Chris Hawks
        5)  Farna Systems, Frank Swygert
        6)  Crystal Palace BBS, Nelson Howard et al
        7)  DISTO, Tony Distefano
        8)  Budgetware, Brian Kitt
        9)  JWT Enterprises, Jordan Tsvetkoff
        10) Adventure Survivors, L. E. & Nan Padgett
        11) The Chicago  OS9 User's Group
        12) The National OS9 User's Group
In addition, there have been verbal intentions of attendance by Kala Software,
CoNect, Animajik Productions, SBUG, and one or two others whose names escape
me at this time.
    Seminars are being planned for, but are not yet cast in concrete, except
for the first meeting on Sunday Morning, which we hope to continue as a
tradition.  That meeting will be the Meditation, Praise, and Worship Service
presided over by Brother Jeremy, a CoCo Comminuty member for as long as I can
remember, having seen him at the first Rainbowfest I attended, which I believe
was in 1986 in Schaumburg, Illinois.
    The site of the FEST! is fairly easy to get to, being alongside of I90 at
IL RTE 31, with a couple of turns onto West River Road.  Air travelers can
reach the site from Chicago's Midway Airport by taking I55 west to I355 north
to I90 west to Elgin; O'Hare arrivals would take I190 out of O'Hare and follow
the signs to I90 west to Rockford, but be sure to get off at IL RTE 31 in
Elgin; Arrivals at Mitchell Field in Milwaukee will want to head south on I94
to I294 south to I90 west (same as before); and finally, should you fly into
Rockford, head north to IL RTE 20 east to I90 east until you approach IL RTE
31, and follow the earlier directions to the Holiday Inn.
    All in all, we at GLENSIDE expect to have a fun-filled weekend filled with
friends, food, excitement, and prises....oh, did I forget to mention the
PRIZES?  Well, you'll have to come to find out about those.  But rest assured,
they will be there, along with the BADGES that we forgot about, last year.
BELIEVE ME!!!!  After all the requests for BADGES!  We won't forget them a
second time!  Come and join us in the revelry.

     Multi-Vue Up and Running
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL

        Well, after constantly putting it off, I recently<FINALLY> got
   Multi-Vue up and running. This time around, I played it smart and
   abandoned ALL of it's documentation<grin>. My only prorblem right
   now<before I install the Gshell patch> is that the only way I can get
   some programs to run is by clicking it once and then selecting 'Open'
   in the files menu. I know this is one way to do it, but isn't this
   only necessary when the command will have some options o iuldn't I be able to just simply click the icon once for it to
   execute?
        Anyhow, MultiVue don't look too bad but it isn't gonna be where
   the majority of my work is done. I'll always be another command line
   man at heart :-)

        There are four secrets to MultiVue. Install Kent's gshell.
Install that gshell. Intstall it (gshell). Get a faster hard drive.

Click click ought to do dang near anything. (hmmmm- try click twice
not click-file-open)

        It still gets more better after following 1 thru 4.

     More Basic Stuff
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL

        I'm in the middle of another little programming project<this
   makes about 4 incomplete ones<G>, this one being a text editor in
   Basic. I was wondering<I asked this before but we didn't get to far
   with it>, is there anyway to turn the echo off<for when I'm using the
   arrow keys>, besides shelling out to Tmode? I was told once that there
   was a system call for this, but we didn't go into much more than that.

Check the OS-9 tech manuals, there is a section on SCF setstat's
(set status of a device) if you use that with SysCall, you will be
able to do anything tmode can do..for a simple editor in Basic, it is
probably easier to just use tmode from a shell..

 Thanks, I'm gonna check that out. Right now it is a small incomplete program
 consisting of two procedures, and the screen writes are very SLOOOWWW. If I
 run the keyread procedure by itself it is great but it takes a lot of time
 when that and the main eitor program are running eachother back and forth. I
figured that as well
 as shelling out to tmode are two of the many possible reasons.
 A lot of my inspiration comes from the simple editor project in the Guide to
 Windows book. It is just another half *ss project now until I get a new
printer.
 Can't stand not having something to print source out on! :-)

Yo Chris,
 Change the terminal control parameters is very easy to do with SysCall. And
while others may argue against the slight overhead increase (is there any?), it
has one very distint advantage. When your program is done, it can put the
terminal back to the way it was. No hardcoded exit conditions.

 Read up on SysCall (I know you know how to use it), I$Getstat, I$Setstat,
and SS.Opt. Also, pages 6-4 through 6-6 in the tech section of the manual.
Note that SS.Opt only copies the PD.Opt section, so the offsets into your
buffer will be $20 less than the numbers listed. offset 00 would be PD.DTP.

 otally untested example code:

 Procedure no_echo
 TYPE regs=cc,a,b,dp:byte;x,y,u:integer
 DIM s1:regs
 dim old_opt(32),new_opt(32),char:byte

 s1.x=addr(old_opt)
 s1.a=0
 s1.b=0
 run syscall($8d,s1)
 new_opt=old_opt
 new_opt(4)=0       (kill echo here)
 s1.x=addr(new_opt)
 s1.a=0
s1.b=0
 run syscall($8e,s1)

 repeat
 get #0, char
 until char=$0D    (loop until <cr> is pressed)

 s1.x=addr(old_opt)
 s1.a=0
 s1.b=0
 run syscall($8e,s1)    (put the orig "tmode" back, untouched)

 end


 This program should get the option part of the path descriptor (same thing
tmode does), make a copy of it, turn echo off in the copy, and then use
the copy to reset the options. Then it runs in an idle loop, snarfing all keys
pressed, exiting only on a <cr> (or break etc). Then, on exit, it sets the
options back to how they were. The program does not know, or care how they
were set. It just gives the original copy of the options back.

 You can control anything tmode can do this way. This includes echo, line feeds,

Break and Shift-break, page pause, and on.

  Next weeks lesson will be on how to grab the original window's type,
palettes and size so thatthey can also be restored on exit. :>

Nah, shelling to tmode is almost un-noticable, try this, do a for/next
loop to say, 100 times, and run tmode over and over..and time it by
printing date$ at before for and after next to show how much time has
elapsed, then remove the tmode line, and do it again, I bet there is
almost no difference, IF you are using the standard microware shell
or dont have or your shell+ prompt set to show the current directory
I doubt any real speed is involved there..I could be wrong though..
for you have any for/next's in your program? if so, make the variables
all integers, this will speed up loops alot (but it you really need the REAL
type number, then there is nothing you can do, but any un-dimed variables
default to real's..this can be slow)

The main problem with shelling out to tmode, is there is no way to restore the
terminal back to exactly the way it was before your started the program,
which is the polititically correct thing to do when you start chaning terminal
parameters.

True, but if he is only changing the echo, and if it is hard-coded for
coco windows, then it wouldnt really matter..because echo is always on in
a coco window.

But if it were going to be used on terminals..well then that is a different
story..

(I do agree though that syscall should be used for a major program, I think
shelling to tmode is ok for a smallish editor, but then, figuring out syscal
is a great way to learn a bit more about the OS, so, I dunno, I will just
sit on the fence on this one :) )

Sure it is possible, I do that with my brother-in-laws laptop all the time
from my 512K Coco and a null-modem cable... The only difference is that I use
Supercomm, but, a comm program is a comm program when you are null-modemed
and not looking for pretty screen codes and such(besides, supercomm supports
Zmodem!)  Just connect a null-modem cable from the comm port on the PC to the
rs232 port on the coco, in the PC communications software, set it up to use
the comm port that the null modem cable is hooked to(ex. Comm1) and set the baud

rate for both machines at 19200. With the Coco, send the program and with the
PC recieve(just like transfering with a modem). Works great!!!!

Correct, there is nothing legally wrong with use "diff" formats, such as
ipatch. But I feel it much better in situations like this (things like gshell
are another matter) to at least attempt to contact the original author,
explain the what's and why's of the changes, and try to get permission to
upload a complete new binary. Less hard feelings this way, and it's easier
on me *and* the end user.
 Note that I followed the same approach on SuperComm. Version 2.1a was
originally just a set of bug fixes. I was literally within minutes o
uploading it as an ipatch file when I finally got in touch with Dave, the
orig author. The result of that contact was not only permission to upload
a complete new binary, but also to continue development. Hence v2.2, and
soon-to-be-released v2.3.

I disagree.  If you had included the STOCK part in your original
statement, I wouldn't have said anything since it is true a stock CoCo
under OS-9 can't do 9600 baud very well.  The part I took exception to
was your statement that the problem is the buggy 6551 which is not true.

Regardless, let's just agree on the point that it is very well possible
for a CoCo running OS-9 to achieve 9600 baud or greater on a serial port
using stock hardware but with some modifications and newer drivers.

             FLASH ! FLASH ! FLASH!
  Hi Frank,  I'm happy to say Allen from Wolver Software just
called, and reports all authors contibutions are now merged.
  "Sounds of the Hounds"
      CoCo III version is soon to be come a reality.

  I do want to point out, "I will not be selling this product".

  All marketing will be handled directly from the source.  Or
Wolver Software, Inc in LA.  I've recomended your '68 Micors, as
well as UPTIMES, NINETIMES, and they have contacted Rick Cooper,
(Rick's CFDM).  I mentioned your intro offer, but they said their
thinking was 1 full page followed by three half pages.

  Intorduction will be Via The UPGRADE Disk magazine (boy, did I
have to talk for that one) in early April.  Then they are
expecting to start ads May or June.  BTW: remind mem to ask CBJ
about it being at the ChiCo Fest.  I doubt they will take a
booth, but are looking for someone to have it there, for them.
I'm trying to talk 'em down,, but their targeting price at
$44.95.  I'd quickly agree it's worth every penny, but don't
think the CoCo market will handle that much at this point.  I
might get them to go for a little less.    What do you think?
    Til then,,, Terry g

     Vendors?
     From: MRUPGRADE    To: CBJ (NR)

  Hi Carl,
  As you've read in the UPGRADE soon to be released is: "The
Sounds of the Hounds" V3.7 (CC3 version) from Wover Soft, Inc.
Their primarily PC these days,, but got this one rewrote for
theh CoCo community.
  anyhue,,,
  I got the promo for the ChiCo Fest, booth inforamtion.  and as
you know, the opening Concrete season won't allow me to be there.
Besides "I personally, nor MI&CC" will be selling S.O.H. anyway.
 The qestion is: can you suggest a vendor who has a CoCo with
RGB screen, that wuold be willing to tkae orders, demo, sell,
etc?
  BTW: it does look like you've got a good start on booths, I
just don't know which ones are  MM/1 and which are CoCo?
  Oh,, and som will be send to UPGRADE subscribers, for review
(quite a few actually), would you have time to review it for
CoCo 1,2,3 or would you suggest someone else?
    Til then,,, Terry g

  He's probaly like Tim Jenison, who wrote MAX III.  He wrote it for a price
 and split.  Was never really  a part of marketing.  that's why we've
 never seen an upgrade to MAX III.  Or even patches.
  Tim is however doing very well, on the AMIGA.  There his product or one of,,
 sells near two thou.  Video Toaster.
  Colorware as well changed hands after MAX II.
  You ocould have quite a search.

  Hi Frank,,,
  I forgot to mention, "I will be sending you a copy of "Sound
of the Hounds" for review.   Will you review it or someone else?

  Oh,, and I'll say it here so as not to flood the base with
"Sounds of the Hounds" messages:
  Many of you now subscribing to the UPGRADE will recieve a
prieier copy of "The Sounds of the Hounds".  Several go to
mags,, and we'll be sending out a number to our regular MI&CC
members, asking or a review.
  Remember as stated in the last UPGRADE.
  1. this is a very unique adventure.
  2. Many who don't usually play adventure games, will still
enjoy S.O.H.
  3. The realistic story line, is said to literally scare CoCo
users.

 Oh, and BTW: I know it's been said before, but the unique "copy
protection" on this disk allows confidence.  Well let me put it
this way; It backs up easy,,, but,,, Well I'm not allowed to say
more.

     Help
     From: REVWCP       To: ALL

Dear Friends:
I purchased an AT&T PC6300, an old 8086 based MSDOS (I think) machine.  It has
a nice hard drive and perhaps some other useful things.  I do have a problem
however.  There is no boot disk.  It looks for a floppy, switches to Hard
Drive, and then back to Floppy.  Does anyone have an old copy of MSDOS 1.x.


Rick Ulland of CONECT suggested a CPM86.  Gene thought maybe UNIX.  It has a
128k of ram...............You should see the power wires running to the mother
 board, 4 guage wire.  The hot wire from the battery for accesories in the
Monk Mobile (station wagon) isn't that heavy. I have some 8086 code that was
used to drive some Benoulli Drives and a Tape backup unit.  I also have a
cross assembler, so you can why I would like to get this thing runnning.  It
would, hjhowever, make a wonderful case for a COCO, and just might eventually.

You need the Xmode utility from the Eliminator package to set You buffer size

Its nice to know there are those who respond with advice and encouragement.
Lately, knock on wood and fingers crossed, we haven't had any lockups.  We're
not sure if we really did something in our rooting (pun intended) in the files
that has caused this hiatus in the crashes or if it just decided to go into
remission on its own.  Either way we'll take it. Thanks again to you and all
