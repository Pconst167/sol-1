Thanks for the idea. since I was not the orginal programmer of KTerm, I
had opted to leave as much code the same as possible and only change
that part of the code that needed to be changed for enhancements and/or
bug fixs. Your idea does sound a lot better and the envioroment varible
MODEM is a better way to go. That is a very easy change.
  As for KTerm -?, I already open a window at startup, that in the
finial version will have the name, version, copyright, & ect on it.
I'll keep it in mine and see what other's think about that.

JA> Paul,
JA>   The correct way is to add a enviroment varible in your startup file.
JA> Just add  TERMINAL_PORT /t3

John,
    Is TERMINAL_PORT /t3 different than MODEM /t3 ??
I have the latter one in my file.

JD> As for KTerm -?
 
OK, let me present you with this situation. Ever go through your commands 
directory, and wonder what a particular program was? Type in the file 
name, followed by a -? and you can find out easily and painlessly.
 
Other thing is, when KTerm exits, try doing a Select(stdout), rather than 
exiting as it does now. That will return you to the window that you 
started from, rather than the last window.
 
Last thing is imagine this: Somebody who isn't running K-Windows runs 
KTerm with the -? option. First thing KTerm does is try to open up a 
window that can't be opened. Then it prints out the info detailing what 
the program is to a window that doesn't exist.
 
Adding the -? is really trivial:
 
if(!strncmp("-?", argv[1], 2))
{
     fprintf(stderr, "KTerm v1.0 (Beta)";
     etc...
     exit(0);
}
 
Stick that in right at the beginning of the code, and you're all set, and 
conform with the vast majority of OSK programs, which do respond to -?.
 
TTFN. Colin.

You will notice the To field has my name as Warren.hrach.  This seems
the only drawback but since I seldem get netmail not a problem since I
use Getmsgs and just search the output for 'Warren' anyway.  The routing 
is confusing but I do know the 202/723 is our local UUCP Usenet link. 
The actual msg came routed to my hub 202/335 and arrived at 3:40AM.
Please note that reading normal mail on a RiBBS BBS one does not see the 
lines starting with a ^.
The only hassle I have had on this end sending back is that I have to
reroute the outgoing Internet to 202/701 or maybe my hub 202/335. I have 
tried sending to 202/723 but his system wont recognize my BBS as a valid 
Fido BBS but maybe I can find out what is wrong there.  You will note
the time it took to reach me (09:32 your time to 03:40 my time, 6 hrs
-2hrs time diff. = 4 hrs) is remarkabley fast.
I shall respond back in my Net msg base also to see if you get the reply 
correctly.

Yes, they are different, but I am going to change the enviroment varible 
to MODEM instead of TERMINAL_PORT.
