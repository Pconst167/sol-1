Well after several months of 100% Internet and UUCP success it finally
hiccuped last evening and continues on today.  What happened is the MM/1 
Developers list had a bad msg get returned and that in turn got resent
to all the addressees on the Mushroom list at Indy.net.
I called Boisy Pitre at Microware as that is the source of the
orginating bounce.  He told me that it got stopped but only after tons
of bounces got out.  I cannot get ahold of my host by voice so he must
not be home. Anyway temporarily my Internet is broke.  Maybe tomorrow my 
host will return and can head off the bounces at his end.

  Question?  Will a Maxtor LXt-340SY SCSI-2 drive work with the MM/1?
Oops, too late. I've purchased one and can't get it to format.
The machine does recognize the drive, SCSI ID-1.  However format 
complains about illegal parameters.  The format I'm using is 2.4 but I 
have tried 2.3, with proper dmode settings for cntl.

Stephen,
      I just installed a Maxtor 7290S 290meg drive as /H1 and had
similar format problem.  I do not know it you have similar problem as
the 7290S is a scsi 1.  What I found after setting the cntl=8 and
calling format I got the error msg, 'sector size to small'.  Finally a
quick call to David Graham (who formatted my previous Maxtor) and found
out that one needs to use the format option -c=2 and away it went did
both physical and logical and verify and took about 45 min.  
*ONE MORE IMPORTANT NOTE* Be sure and tmode nopause !

I think it was a response to a query about a possible OS-9-related Fest
in Dallas, hence the allusion to the TV show. :-)

There is a strong chance that there will be an MM/1 available in a
lap-top version.  Anyone interested leave a msg. here to ;
(David Graham)
Of course it will be priced a bit higher than the current MM/1 mainly
due to the hi cost of the LCD display.
It would be furnished complete with with all the bundled software now
included with the MM/1.
One of the real bits of software being ported right now for the MM/1 is
RiBBS.  It will be available in similar form that OS9 ribbs is now as
shareware then updated versions available as commercial products.
Tentative names are the shareware version 'SpaRibbs' and the commercial
version 'KRiBBS'.
BTW MM/1 Paddleboards for /T3, /T4 are now available for quick delivery
and the 8meg upgrade boards very soon.
