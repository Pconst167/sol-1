Colin, since today's meeting of the MECCO OS-9 group has been cancelled, 
I thought I would leave you a message here.  Also, to post progress for 
OSTerm 68K customers out there waiting for their updates...
 
Last night I got the necessary enhancements in for the VT100 emulation so 
that it now properly handles Emacs (with multiple buffers on screen) from 
a HP-Unix host, as well as Vi.  (Brian Marcotte's "vt100" program 
will also handle Emacs, but can't quite deal with Vi.)  This should bring
the level of emulation supported from "basic" to fairly general, though
it still won't support different character sets/sizes, 132 column mode,
and some of the other less-used functions.  But it now should cover
all the main requirements most users will require.  (It's better than the
version of "screen" I have running on the Unix box...  Guess I need to
get a new version of that installed.)
 
So, this just leaves one major item on our checklist for OSTerm V2.1.
 
Cheers... / Ken

Good stuff, Ken!

So that brings emulation modes to:

TTY
ANSI (Colours, characters and screen positioning codes)
VT100
Compuserve
Binary (All characters captured to a buffer, screen-safe ones go to the
screen)
and CC3/K-Windows.

And since external protocols, such as Z-Modem, and Kermit are also
already supported, that only leaves one more item, CIS-B protocol.

TTYL. Colin.

Umm... well, what we used to describe as "CompuServe" mode is now moved 
to "Terminal Options", and appears as "7-bit mask".  This allows the 
masking to be used with the various emulation modes, if desired.  Guess 
that means the manual will need to be updated again <ducking...>

Don't forget the Prompted ASCII transfer mode...  
 
At this stage, I am tempted to suggest that we freeze it withOUT CIS-B 
protocol (which was always considered only a "WBN" (Would Be Nice) for 
this release), and distribute it.  We've made so many little changes and 
enhancements that I'm beginning to have trouble remembering them.

Good luck with getting UUCP up and running.

I've got mine up and running pretty cleanly now. It compiled first time
on my MM/1.

Only found one problem, and almost have that tracked down in the source.
 Mailx does not seem to like one-line messages. Other than that, I
haven't had any real problems with the package.

It is the best documented one I've seen so far for OS-9/OSK.

TTYL. Colin.

Colin,
      I finally got linked up to our local UNIX Internet host. However
we need to spend time on my setup.  I just recompiled it with the bug
fixes in UUBB20.BUG that was sent out on the OCN net. Took 35 min.

Hi, Warren.

I think pollremote was referring to your system.

On my setup, the uucp files go in:

/dd/usr/postmaster
        cmckay
        spool/files
              incoming
              news
              uucp/uuisis
              uucppublic

uuisis is the system I call to get my mail from.
cmckay and postmaster are accounts on my system, and also appear in the
/dd/sys/password file.

Hope this helps. TTYL. Colin.

Colin,
    Yes I was fortunent to have Boisy log on and chatted with him about
it.  I made up a dir for the system I call like yours uuisis, mine is
jadpc. Now I can log on as postmaster and que up a file for jadpc and
send it ok. But I am still missing a few dirs and/or files. My local
guru will help me get the rest setup I am sure.  But I am having a very
strange thing happen when I do a 'tsmon /t0&'.  I do that and all goes
well, I have the correct modem strings, in fact same as used for RiBBSs.
But after the first call to the modem and login it refuses to answer
another call until the next day ! I must be missing a profile or
something in the .login , .logout files. I have those and they work ok
but still wont accept a second or any more calls. I even reboot, reset
the modem and still wont accept a call. If I deiniz the port and reset
the modem by itself it will accept and answer (send tone) but if tsmon
is on it wont send tone.  Any help apprecieated. I know it is not the
modem as I duplicated the whole  thing with my ZyXEL modem.
  BTW isn't there supposed to be a login log somewhere ?

    How is it that the clock in the MM/1 was able to do its own time change to
daylight savings time???  Last fall I thought I was imangining this, so this 
time I remembered to double check it first.
