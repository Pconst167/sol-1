Dear John:
   While using Kterm I opened a capture file, downloaded the Tech Echo,
and then closed the capture file.  I proceded with a file download and
went to another window to read the just downloaded capture file while
Kterm was still running and found that the file was busy and remained so 
until I terminated Kterm. Would it be possible to change the program to
unlock the capture file when it is closed instead of when the program is 
terminated?        Thanks, George

George,
     I have tested this feature of Kterm both over my null modem and
over a Anchor 2400 modem.  I have used the /t3 port for the null modem
and /t0 port for my Anchor modem.  I find that I have no problems
listing the file in another window even with the capture file still
open (ALT C)  Of course it lists with extra spacing and if I call Ved
and list the file I can set it up with real CR's and then the extra
spacing is gone.
      This is after I close the capture buffer.
Now I have hardware handshaking set but doubt that is what the diff. is, 
maybe it is your 68340 cpu ?  I recall something about the 68340 UG
having new serial drivers for the rs232 ports, could this be it ??
      BTW I recall you mentioned sending me your revised 8 Meg upgrade
documentiation file when you got it debugged. Can you still do this ??

Warren,
    I have the compression turned off. V.42 is still ON(MNP2-4). I think
this is right.

Paul,
    I have always stuck with V.42b but my ZyXEL will connect with
MNp1-4. I have mnp5 disabled on someone elses advice.
    The biggest thing is the fact I just discovered that RiBBS and lock
baud will work fine, just so long as you disable flow control on the
modem.  I am useing Aciadrv and its /t2 for my bbs along with Nitros9
and the ZyXEL set up with flow control off and lock baud on at 9600.
    The problems with the hardware handshaking are gone and noone
connecting at 12, 24, 9600, 14,400 or 16,800 baud has one bit of char.
loose or up/downloading problem. Previous to this I had hardware
handshaking enabled and the RS232pak could not handle the interupts.
Now with it disabled no more dropped chars. Its great, I am very pleased 
with my ZyXEL at this time.
    So anyone that calls here and had to use v.32 in lieu of v.32b can
just call at v.32b no problem now.
