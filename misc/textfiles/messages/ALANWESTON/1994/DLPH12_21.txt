The idea _is_ good and noble, but kinda halts us "mercenary" lots...<G>

On a BBS once, we got into a discussion about providing source with your
release.  One guy said he would NOT use anything that did not have source.
I have released the source with one of my programs ("gfx3" from way back
when..).  But since then, especially in the light of the hassle that Carl
Kreider went through with unauthorized releases of "ar" (and he didn't
even provide source, I don't think), I have decided that it could cause
you problems if someone clobbered up your code and re-released it in your
name, so I'm not sure that I'm as much in favor or releasing code as I
once was.

Again, I can see the point of the restrictions on the GNU stuff, but if
I should release anything, even to the PD, I would still prefer to retain
control over what is done with the code, especially if I'm going to get
blamed for it.  Of course, not releasing code still does not preclude
someone's disassembling the code and working on it, but that would require
a capability in one that would indicate that he could produce good code in
his modifications.

Actually, Carl originally _did_ provide the source with ar .... because that's
the way it was done back then. Unfortunately, even with requests to coordinate
new features and changes through him, someone hacked away at it and  ...

Well ... we all know the rest of the story.

Yeah, I figured that politics was involved.  I'm not really sure how bad the
"flaw" is.. Intel says it's insiginficant, but I saw a msg recently that
it can come up frequently..  I deleted the msgs, but they used a problem
something like this:

    412965/317638*317638-412965

Of course, this should give 0, but the Pentium gave 256, I believe.  I'm not
sure of the exact numbers, and if the digit size is right, and the numbers
here might not work, but this is the general idea.

 BRAVO! Exactly the idea I developed after an earlier response reminded
 me of dsave. What I have now queries user for the drive holding the
 installation disk and the target drive for the program. Dsave
 creates the installation script in /r0, then my program checks to see
 if the target drive is the same as the drive holding the installation
 disk. If it is, it promptes the user to switch disks; if it is not,
 then the installation script is executed.

 What remains is seeing how well I can error check the procedure file
 created by dsave from my graphical front end and deciding if /r0 is
 a proper home for the install script. (Does the -e option avoid the
 production of the script?) Assuming everyone has an /r0 may be a
 risk, no? Possibly could put the install script in /pipe... havent
 tried that one yet.

 Current thought is to feed dsave the source drive (where install disk
 is located) and the destination drive (where program will reside). Let
 dsave make the procedure file, and then stop and check to be sure the
 destination drive is different from the source drive. If it is, go
 ahead and run the install script; if not, prompt user to switch the
 disks (most likely in /d0). Now I could give user a button to click for
 a custom installation, in which case things would stop after the
 install script is created (probably on /r0), and the user could "play"
 with that script to heart's content. How does that strike ya? Notice
 this approach relies on the distributer to establish where on the HD
 the program will go by arranging the appropriate directory structure on
 the distribution disk.

Sounds good to me.  The option to play with the script would be what the
experienced user could use.  The beginnger could just blast through and get
it installed.  I guess the script file gets started "manually" after a user
messes with it.  The beginner just clicks a "button" and it is fired up.

 Here's the scenario that worries me: Say a user has a machine with
 only /d0 (no HD or /d1) and wants to install his/her software on a
 disk (probably a boot disk since all he/she has is /d0). If I do
 dsave -e and it executes the install script as its created the files
 on the installation disk get written right back to it! The user needs
 a chance to switch disks before the install script created by dsave
 is actually executed, no? Come to think of it, if the user has only
 one drive, I've got to copy the program files off of the installation
 disk too. They can't go to /dd since that's where they already are!
 And I cant send them to a pipe unless I assume all the files on the
 installation disk are in the root directory...UGH! Look's like if I
 dont assume /r0, I cant create the program for a single drive
 machine. More thinking to do ........

Actually, you could use the TMPDIR environment variable to read the
directory to use for the temporary files, and extract the name of the default
driver from that.  If you advise users of that usage, they can adjust for it,
and if you find the default drive and the installation drive are the same,
then you can use DSAVE without -e, and prompt accordingly.

 Thanks for your thoughts. Only bigtime conceptual problem I have now
 is how to deal with a user who has only a single floppy machine. Have
 to write the program and install script to /r0 (running the risk of
 /r0 existing) but cant write them to /dd bacause they'll end up on
 the installation disk which the user must remove to make room for his
 program disk! Guess just check to see what drives are available and
 if no /r0 or /d1 or /h0 abort, no?

Look at `popen' for a way to attack the problem of requiring a
temporary directory.  (It's in the TOPS stuff.)  `popen' lets you
run a program and read it's output (or write to it's input).  The idea
is to run dsave to build the script using `popen', and just read the
script dsave is spitting out and store it in memory.  Then use
`popen' again to write the script to a shell for consumption.

Another approach you might look into is stealing code from an archiving
program such as `tar.'  That saves floppy disk space (one file is
better than 500), while still preserving file attributes, etc.
There's plenty of PD versions of `tar,' which is another plus.
For single-drive installation, you could then figure out the trick
used by `copy' to do single-drive copies, just dearchiving to the
target disk as you went along.  That dispenses with the script entirely,
which may be good or bad, depending on your viewpoint.

This may help, I didn't read the whole thread of messages so this may
not be what you are looking for.  The Microware C (CoCo version anyway)
has a system call function called defdrive().  It returns a pointer
to a string containing the name of the system drive (for example "/dd")
the system gets this info from the init module.

OK you make some very good points.

I think that learning the extensions of aa language that is an extension of one
you already know would be easier than learning a whole new language. Therefore
for someone who is familiar with Basic09 then learning CDL Basic would be a
snap over learning C. Mike tried to make CDL Basic as close to Basic09 as
possible.
This was done to make the transition easier.

We also noted that ads in mags like Midnight Eng show a strong support for
Basic.
To that end CDL Basic would appeal to those users. Mike will be sending product

     HELP with MM/1 video
     From: MARTYGOODMAN To: ALL

I need to know exactly what kind of physical video connector
the MM/1 uses, and what its pin out is.   I've been told
that it uses a standard DB 9 female connector on the MM/1.
IS this so?

Does the MM/1 put out the same sort of RGB analog video at 15.75 KHz
H sync rate and 60 Hz vertical sync rate that is put out by the CoCo 3?
That is what I had thought.   But some just sent me a pin out for
the MM/1 that would imply it did NOT put out analog video at all,
but instead put out IBM style CGA video.   Can someone here
clarify this for me?

It is analog video.  It can feed into a CM-8 or Maggie.  I'm using a
Diamond Scan (multisync of course!).  The reason you have a "CGA" pinout is
that it is the one given in the tech reference manual.  I believe it is the
same for the MM/1 but analog on the lines. (Geez....I did this so long ago.)
I had to build an adapter for the monitor's 15 pin plug.

Marty,

 The MM/1 puts out a pretty much CoCo compatable signal.  I don't think
it has quite as much drive ( v p-p ), but it's close. I use a CM8 on mine.

 Connector is a standard DB9 female on the machine (reverse of clonish
serial ports).

 1  Ground
 2  Ground
 3  Red
 4  Green
 5  Blue
 6  N/C
 7  Sound
 8  HSync
 9  VSync

This is directly out of the mm/1 technical manual, page 13-1. I just noticed
that a few pages later, mixed in with the clone serial and parallel connector
descriptions is a diagram of a CGA port. This may be what caused the
confusion.
 The only difference is Intensity becomes a N/C, and the N/C becomes sound.

     Monitor Headache
     From: CHARLESAM    To: MARTYGOODMAN (NR)

Marty, maybe you can help me put an end to my current monitor problem. I
always have pix at startup but after about 10minutes the screen goes black.
I can get the pix back with a blow to the side and that works a couple of times
but then it goes down for the count. The monitor is combination of two different

Magnavoxs, namely a tube from one model, the guts from another. I bought it for
dirt at Atlanta cause my monitor (CM8) had developed loss of hoz hold. Is this
an overheating problem or a break in the circuit board?
    I plan to get a Sony after Christmas but I would like to get to the cause
of this problem if possible. I know I'm not giving you a wealth of useable
info here, but maybe you can suggest where the problem might live.
    One more symptom is the picture starts dancing or shrinking a little
before it goes black. Thats it. If I leave it off for a half hour, I'm back
in business again. Thanx Charlie

It may be nosey to barge in here like this but your problem sounds like a heat
problem.  I have a Maggie with the same problem or should I say had.  If you
are reasonable good with soldering, try resoldering the contacts around the
high voltage circuit (with it off and discharged of course) especially on the
circuit board where the flyback transformer is located.  It seems their wave
soldering wasn't so good and the solder fails (cold solder joints).  Mine
started with that nonsense and it got worse until nothing would show of the
screen.  Seems a solder connection would fail but it would show up only when
hot.  The high voltage would arc at the joint until the break got larger and
larger, so it would break contact with less and less heat each time.  Found out
by looking at the board with the monitor on in a dimly lit room.  Could see the
arcing at the bad joint.  A little resoldering, no more problem.  Hope this
is of help.

Sounds like a bad connection! VERY common on the Maggot box! open it up and
look at the FLYBACK transformer connections  <like a 2/3 rd circle>..These
pins are BIG and they tend to zip them through the solder vat,and the connection

made is ok for a while! around two years!!!!! then with the heat/cold the
pin parts company with the solder....Interm...problem..Thump it it works

I have seen something like this at work and here at home.  A good thing to
check here are the solder connections underneath the flyback transformer.
As the monitor heats and cools each time you use it the flyback expands
and shrinks just a bit.  This flexing can break the solder connections that
often don't have enough solder from the mass production assembly line.  Get
a magnifying glass or the 30 times microscope at Radio Shack.  This works
very well for checking this.   -Mark-

 Yeah, long time ago Delphi announced that computer sigs were moved to
the "computers" heading, and eventually looking under "group" would quit
working. I'm surprised it took so long. Just do a
"co os", that will get you here. The "go" command is just another way to
say "main"; you don't need it when you're at (or don't need to go through)
main.

Probably fuzzy logic, Randy. :-) Actually the stipulations DELPHI puts on

some exceptions to this rule. Why CO works for COCO when there is a
COMMODORE entry in the menu I don't know. Theoretically it shouldn't.

I have been using the Tandy Deskmate program lately to prepare a rental

You've got several choices, depending on if you have the complete OS-9
system (ie the system disk etc.) or not.  Probably the easiest thing to
do is to use Ded to patch the '/p' descriptor on your boot disk.  Ded is
available in the database here.

To patch the descriptor do the following to a COPY of your boot disk:

        OS9>ded os9boot
                You should get a screen with columns and rows labled
                in Hex (but don't worry it's not as complicated as it
                looks <g>)
        CMD:l
        link to which module: p
                Now you should have a new screen with a title that says
                "Module:  p".
        CMD: e
                The cursor should now be in the area that shows all the
                Hex digits
                Move the cursor (using the arrow keys) down to the thrid
                row (labled 20) and across to the eight column (labeled
                7) type 04 (this sets the baud rate to 2400 baud)
                Press <ENTER>, this should return you to the CMD prompt.
        CMD: w
        Are you sure? y
                (it writes out the changed module)
        CMD: v
        Are you sure? y
                (this verifys the module)
        CMD: q
                (this quits Ded)

If you don't want to do this and you have the complete OS-9 system do this

        OS-9> xmode /p baud=4
                place a freshly formated disk in /d1
        OS-9> cobbler /d1

        OS-9> chd /d0
                This makes the default working directory /d0
        OS-9> dsave /d0 ! (-x chd /d1)
                This should copy all the files from your boot
                disk to the new boot disk in /d1.

If you only have one drive then this gets a little trickier, if this is the case

then let me know and I'll tell you how to do i.  Although in this case using
Ded is by far the easiest.

     Kermit protocol

 I left a message recently in the service forum asking if Delphi was going to
 support the new Kermit 5A with sliding window and variable packet sizes.  I
 was told that no one in service knows one way or the other but that Delphi
 was working on upgrades for 1995.  This is very fast transfer protocol - I
 did some tests on a dedicated 9600 baud line and got about 11,000 bits per
 second - so maybe if we all flood the feedback mail with request for this
 transfer protocol Delphi will oblige by addding it for '95.

     RE: Kermit protocol (Re: Msg 91023)
     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: PAGAN

If you hear anything, I'd like to know.  Just to clarify a bit,
Kermit 5A is the newest of the portable `C-Kermit' communications
programs.  C-Kermit has been ported to a huge variety of machines,
and, not surprisingly, has excellent support of the Kermit file
transfer protocol.
   For the record, sliding windows and variable packet sizes have
been around since 1986.  One early implementation of these features
was named `Super Kermit,' and that name still pops up occasionally.
Many other features have been added to the Kermit protocol and
the C-Kermit program since then, several of which will hopefully
be adopted by other protocols as well.  (In particular, Kermit now
identifies the character set used by a text file, which is invaluable
when working with 8-bit text files.)
   Speedwise, Kermit and ZModem are about the same.  The only real
distinction is that ZModem has fewer options, and is hence easier
to use, and Kermit works under many situations that ZModem doesn't.
   You're not the first to complain to Delphi about their archaic
Kermit support.  Hopefully it will improve, but I'm not holding my
breath.

Actually, my experience is quite the opposite.  I've recently seen
the output of several ink jet printers that I had a hard time distinguishing
from laser output.  The only real giveaway was that the ink jet doesn't
produce as dark a black; the output tends to be noticably grey rather
than the dark black common with lasers.

    I suspect the biggest cause of `blurring' in ink jets is from
the paper output.  Cheaper ones simply slide the pages atop one another,
which does smear the ink.  The newer ones slide the new page on top of
two rails and then withdraw the rails to gently drop the new page on top
of the old ones.  Seems to work quite effectively.

    I should point out that part of my experience is with a laser printer
that suits my needs nicely except for some firmware bugs that cause it
to misplace characters by a pixel.  While 1/300 inch doesn't sound like
much, it is QUITE noticable in a line of text.  When I need better-quality
output, I've been using Ghostscript to render the PostScript and then send
the resulting bitmap to the printer, which avoids the firmware bugs
in the printer.  Next time I buy a printer, I'll probably pay the premium
for one with an Adobe PS interpreter in it.  Hopefully, that will lack
the bugs.

I completely agree that for volume printing, a good laser is well worth
the investment.  With a 500+ page book sitting on my computer, I go
through a lot of paper these days, and my three-year-old investment
in a laser printer is definitely paying for itself.

However, I still recommend ink jets for home use.  I've seen no
lasers for under $500 that I would buy for my own use, and the
relatively low volume required by most home users doesn't really
strain a printer that hard.  My previous dot-matrix lasted for seven
years, thanks largely to infrequent use.  My 3-year-old laser has
fewer than 8,000 pages on it, and I suspect that's considerably
higher than most home users.

I'm really appreciating buying a laser that only requires a toner
replacement: $20 rather than $80 for a cartridge that includes
a lot of additional machinery.

I, too, have been quite satisfied with inkjet printers, Tim.  I would point
out that many people degrade inkjet output because they buy the cheapest
possible paper, and, then, expect that the ink won't bleed at all.  Part of
owning an inkjet is using the proper paper when one wants high output quality.
 Personally, I use the cheapest possible ink for refilling, but I am careful
about the paper.  For really important documents, I make sure to use the
proper ink AND the proper paper.

     VT100 Help
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

Hi everyone,

I'm in the process of adding VT-100 support to LinkUp and need some type
of documentation that outlines the various VT-100 codes and what they do,
as well as how to respond to them if necessary.

I would appreciate any files one could e-mail me.

Tim has upload Vt100 info to one of the databases. Check the Telcom and
Programmers areas... I know there is some pretty good info already here.

Where?  I did a search for 'VT' in the Programmer, Telecom and OSK Telecom
databases, but all I got were programs.  No information files.

If I'm not mistaken it might be with the C help files tim uploaded... I'll
do some digging, and followup to this post where i find them.

Hmm.. can't seem to find it... You might try dropping Tim or Eddie a message
since they both had good docs on VT100 at one time for vterm and kbcom.

     os9 boot
     From: TAULBORG     To: ALL

I have a problem booting when I first power up!I will turn my computer on
and everything goes on and up to speed(including my hard drives) and I
try to boot. It starts with floppy then reads the startup from hard drive.
It fails at first but when I turn off /h0 and boot straight from floppy
and do a dcheck of /h0 then reboot,IT DOES!!!Why didn't it do it the
first time?Oh yea I did turn on /h0 before I did a dcheck of it. It also
sometimes boots right when after I have had the computer running in rsdos
for some time(about 30mins to an hour).I know that more info will
probably be needed to solve this dilema so I will answere all questions
as best I can!

sounds like you have some flaky sectors that are effected by heat, i had
a hard disk once that failed to boot up cold, so i left it on all the time

Hi Mike,
  I figured someone would know what those characters are.  Problem is
though, I am not using TelStar, I am not even using an OS-9 communication
program.  I am using a "messed up dog" program called ComBase which does
an emulation of ProComm.  I only mentioned TelStar because it works quite
similar.  I have not found a way of changing the emulation, so maybe I am
going to have to change my Delphi settings to ANSI until I get back on
with my CoCo.  Thanks for the reply.  See ya.

LONG LIVE OS-9! <FOREVER> ** In whatever form it is in!

Hi again, Mike,
  I just went into Using Delphi to change my terminal setting.  No ANSI
so I changed it to Unknown and that seems to have worked for now.  Thank
you for the reply.  See ya.

Dear friends:
Once again it is almost Christmastide.  I want to take the
opportunity to thank all of you who have given so many gifts
to me and the rest of the OS-9 community this past year.  Your
willingness to share programming and technical knowledge...your
words of support and encouragment to newcomers...your kind notes
to me at various times, both to assist when I have a computer
related need, or just to say hello.  My chosen life, that as a
monk, allows me few luxuries.  Having taken a vow of poverty, I
do not have a great deal of personal possessions, and as far as
the world is concerned, I am a poor man.  But, when I count all
of you, my friends, I am quite wealthy indeed.

At Midnight mass, on Christmas eve, it is customary for a priest
to remember family and friends during the prayers.  I want to
assure that you will all be in my prayers that night.  As has
become my own custom, if there are any that you would like me to
remember in my prayers that night, any special intentions for
yourselves, your friends, and family, please send me an email
message with your intentions and I will be pleased to remember
them in prayer.

I know that I have said this many times, but the OS-9 community
is a very special part of my life.  I look foreward to the Fests,
and other times when we can get together.  I wish all of you a
blessed holiday time, and a peacefull and prosperous New Year.

Thanks, Rev.  I am one of those terrible and heretical Agnostics, but I know a
true Christian when I "see" one.  We have never met, but may only good befall
you.  Happy holidays!

     Deskmate
     From: 2RSMITH      To: CHYDE

I managed to get ded from the app files..BUT I dont know how to quite
understand u're instructs.   The deskmate dos gets all those icons.  I
tried my os9 System disk then changed to the deskmate desk using the
chx chd routine but typing OS9>ded os9boot gets me errors.  Could U
explain when I place the SYS disk in or the DESKM disk in when etc.?
I'm trying to change the baud in the DESKMATE disk to 2400--maybe
I haven't explained that very well. I wouldn't blame U if U give up;
what with christmas and all. Have a good one----:-)  Ray

No problem Ray, we'll see if I can explain this right <g>.

First I should mention that it's been pointed out that Deskmate may let
you set the baud rate for the printer.  I don't have the program so I
can't check.  You may want to check the manual, it may be listed under
printer in the index, or maybe where it talks about the word processor.

Second a couple of questions so I'll know exactly what to tell you <g>.

 1) you have 2 drives right?
 2) How do you get into DeskMate?  Do you boot from your system disk and
    start DeskMate from the OS9 prompt, or do you boot from the DeskMate
    disk (this way DeskMate should start automatically)?
 3) If I remember right ded comes in archived format, have you un-archived
    it?

I'm on almost every day, so you ought to be fixed up before Christmas <g>.

        Chris

     JEVESTAL on Delphi
     From: ONTHEFRITZ   To: ALL

Hi all!  This is Jim Vestal aka JEVESTAL, I'm borrowing a friend's account
to post this so please don't send me email on this account.

I'm posting this due to my account being shut down as of today until at
least the first week of Januany.  I may not be able to read the forum
messages until then and won't be able to make the cool confs until then
too.

If you send email to JEVESTAL account I won't get it until I have access
again.

You can email me on my BBS (Narnia BBS), the internet email address is:

jevestal%narnia@sandv.chi.il.us

or

jevestal@narnia.citrus.sac.ca.us

I'll be monitoring the CoColist via a local bulletin board.

Wishing all you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, see you all in 1995!

Jim

     RE: RiBBS/FidoNet Message Formats (Re: Msg 90965)
     From: DGANTZ       To: GREGL (NR)

I'm using a combination of Fido and RiBBS docs.  File call FSC0001.TXT and
INSRB210.LZH.  INSRB210.LZH does not even touch on message or packet formats,
while FSC0001 is incomplete when it comes to what RiBBS produces for messages
or packets.  It's pry incomplete period, no matter what Fido software one
runs.

Wes Gale seems to know the "secret" but he's no longer here (last I heard)
and nearly impossible to get mail to and from on fidonet, plus he has
other problems too.  Charles West left the RiBBS project so I'm not
real sure I could pick his brain either.  I could try Warren Hrach, but as
far as I know, he is only a beta test site and has little if anything to
do with programming.  He strikes me as a test and report site only. An
end user test site.  Maybe I'll try getting ahold of Wes Gale.  He was working
on a similar program.

Thanks Greg, and happy holidays.
          Dave
