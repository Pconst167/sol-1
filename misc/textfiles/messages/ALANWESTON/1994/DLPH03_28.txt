out. Unfortunately, it won't be out in time for the CoCoFest in Chicago,
but I hope to have it out for Christmas this year. That IS NOT a promise

tmd uses the syscall that everyone has been indicating will work for ya.
It just allows you to go tmd("-p") to turn off screen pausing or tmd("p")
to turn it back on, etc

I think you mean "Home Publisher."

Anyway--what you have to do to get your drives to step at 6 ms is
modify the device descriptor modules for the floppy drives to indicate
that they can step at 6 ms.  However, judging by your message (and by
"The CoCo Chronicles"), I would guess that you don't run OS-9 as such,
but just put the Carmen Sandiego disks in the drives and type "DOS,"
so you probably don't have the tools needed to easily find the bytes
to modify.

So, what you'll need to find is someone with a CoCo and OS-9 who can
use ded or some other tool to modify the bootfile (which contains
the device descriptors) for you, or who can look on their copy of
those programs and tell you the offsets that you could perhaps modify
yourself, if you have a Disk BASIC program that will modify the raw
bytes on a disk and can handle OS-9 formatted floppies.  (You'll have
to modify four bytes in each descriptor: one to change the step rate
and three for the module CRC.)

Alas, I can't help you, but I'm sure someone here will be able to.

Opinions herein are those of their respective authors and not necessarily

 >step at 6 ms.  for the following:

 If you have the 'modpatch' utility and a way to create one text file and
 modify another (build) try this trick:

 Create a text file on the disk with the following contents:

    l dd
    c 14 0 3
    v
    l d0
    c 14 0 3
    v

 Call it "six_ms_patch" or something.  Next add to the "startup" file on each
 disk the line:

    modpatch <six_ms_patch

 This will link to the default drive (/dd) and drive zero (/d0) in memory,
 modify the value at offset $14 to a 6 ms step rate and then update the
 descriptor.  This change is only to the descriptor in memory and will not
 affect your disk.

 This way you don't have to go thru the process of creating a new boot disk
 for each of the applications.  If you can find someone who has a complete
 OS9 level II system then you might ask them to set this up for you.

 There are more 'elegant' solutions but this one works and is easy for a
 beginner to set up.  I know this because I used it myself until I figured
 out the mysteries of 'os9gen' and 'cobbler'.

He wont have BUILD or MODPATCH unless he has the full OS-9 system..
TANDY doesnt supply anything that is not needed for the program to run
and os-9 commands are not needed..

He will really have to get someone else to do it, or use a disk editor as
someone else mentioned...

Is this a package for OS-9 or CoCo Disk BASIC.  The reason I never
replied was that I ASSUMED it was for DISK BASIC... if it IS for
OS-9 the OS-9 Underground would love to review a copy.  Please let

     Supercomm...
     From: DBREEDING    To: RANDYKWILSON

Randy, I think that you are the agent for supercomm, so I'll address this
to you.  I just grabbed it a week or so ago, and in working with it, I
found something that seems to be a problem in at least my setup.

My setup is a Disto SC-2 w/4in1, Disto Clock Edition 9, sacia w/the
supercomm patches (only, not the ones Paul uploaded), and VRN suite of
modules.

When I close a capture buffer (that is SHIFT-Downarrow) after the prompt
"...Close it <Y/N>"... after I respond "y", something is sent to the modem
and supercomm locks up.  This is with the modem in command mode..  I also
tried this with the standard Disto clock and ACIAPAK with the same results.

One other thing... with IT.XTP set with bit 6 (forced DTR) set, as supplied,
if I exited my telecom program (OSTerm also), and turned my modem off, it
would crash my system. (I know this is not a fault of supercomm, but thought
I might add it).

Anyway, I thought I'd throw this up at ya and see what you might come up with.
The above situation might not be the way things would need to be done (close
buffer with modem in cmd mode), but at any rate it does represent a
possiblity for error and should be looked into.  Of course the situation
might be caused by the way my port handles RTS/CTS etc, but I would think
that this port should be supported.

BTW, here's my current xmode:
    nam=T2 mgr=SCF ddr=SACIA hpn=07 hpa=FF54 upc=00 bso=01
    dlo=00 eko=01 alf=01 nul=00 pau=00 pag=18 bsp=08 del=18

     RE: Supercomm... (Re: Msg 86509)
     From: RANDYKWILSON To: DBREEDING

David,
   Both problems are known. Unforch, due to the coco telcom enviroment, there
ain't much I can do about it.

  Turning modem off hangs the system. Yep, sure does, but only with certain
clock modules. congrats on tracing this to bit 6. Took me forever to figure this

one out, though I was doing it via email/forum. with the 6551, to leave DTR true

means leaving the chip partially hot. Turning the modem off causes the lines to
change state, and the 6551 tosses an IRQ (it shouldn't but does. BUG!).
Of course, SAcia is gone, the irq handler has been removed, and so clock runs in

an endless loop looking for someone to turn this damn interupt off. Apparent
lockup. The answer is... DON'T SET BIT 6!!!  :>


  The lockup with ascii capture close is a lot tougher. SuperComm sends out
an X-Off (if enabled) to stop the sender before going to disk. It has to do
this in order to not loose massive amounts of data on floppy based systems.
But when you're in command mode, the modem just echos this x-off char right
back to SAcia. When SuperComm is done writing, it sends an X-On. But in
this case, SAcia won't send the char out, since it's x-off'd. Deadlock.
Nasty.

   Normally I recommend running with only partial xon-off control. Disable
the Tx side. i think the setting is par=04, but need to check it. This
makes SAcia ignore the bounced Xoff. But if you're using a high speed modem
with soft flow control, this will screw things up.
   I just realized how to fix it. Let me screw together a new SAcia, and I'll
mail it to you for beta testing.

     From: DBREEDING    To: RANDYKWILSON

Randy, thanks for taking the time to describe the turn-of-modem problem
and the thing about closing files.  I would assume that the problem with
file-close would not persist with modem in data mode - I didn't really
have the XOff figured out, but in the back of my mind, I had a suspicion.
Hadn't really given S-Com a thorough wring-out. Is it actually superior
to OSTerm?  OSTerm has a few shortcomings itself - no ascii upload being
my main gripe.

RE: the modem turn-off thing:  I experienced a similar thing when I patched
my Clock module with the Bruce Isted Gime toggle with WizPro.  Of course
it provided its own Driver and in this light, I would suspect that its
problem was possibly a result of the same thing.  I never did use the Wiz
package, although it did have some appealing screens.

I'll give S-Com a further wringout with my local BBS - I feel a little
giddy when trying something like this till I get used to it.  Feel like
I'm walking on eggs <g>.  BTW.. I think I mentioned that I'm using the
version of Sacia that came with the SuperComm pkg.  Didn't install the
patches that Paul uploaded.

Thanks again...

     BBS Software
     From: NEHOWARD     To: ALL

Hello to all, Sysops Especially!
   Wouldn't it be nice to have a OS9 Based, BBS Package for the Coco that:

    1) Auto-Detects baud rate, reliably, from 300 to 14400 bps?
    2) Auto-Detects ANSI, from 300 to 14400 bps?
    3) Auto-Detects RIP(for MSDOG Users!), from 300 to 14400 bps?
    4) Had 'Sysop defined' priority levels for:
           a> 'Waiting for caller'<node idle>
           b> 'Caller on line'<User on System>
           c> 'Netmail Connection'<duh!>
    5) Proprietary Netmail Package<System Exclusive>
    6) Had full use of UUCP Network Mailers<Via Rick Adams UUCP v4.2>
    7) UUCP Gateway Program that allowed users access to UUCP without
       direct Hard Drive Access.
    8) Had a 'multi-domain' type 22 nodelist mailer.
    9) Could have 255 menus with 24 options per menu.
   10) Could have 255 message bases with 20 on the 'proprietary' mailer
       and 100 on the 'multi-domain' mailer.
   11) Supported X-modem, Xmodem 1K, Y-modem, Y-modem Batch, Z-Modem
       file transfer options.
   12) Built-in 'Screen Saver' with Sysop definable text.
   13) Multi-Node Compatible(how many idependently addressed 'true' RS232
       ports do you have and how much system RAM do you have?)
   14) COMPLETELY Sysop definable!!!!!
   15) Custom 'ANSI' and 'RIP' Menus EASILY installed with your favirite
       text editor.
   16) Menus can be run from 'RAM Disk' for speed and efficiency.
   17) Runs all RIBBS games on-line.
   18) System Editor can be used on-line or locally.(in color!)
   19) EXTREMELY flexible access options for users(sysop defined)
   20) Call-Back veifier that automatically validates users and updates
       access levels(Sysop defined calling base!)
   21) This list could go on and on.........

   If any or ALL of this sounds interesting, come to the Coco Fest! in
Elgin(Chicago) and see the release!!! OR, if you cant wait<grin> call my
BBS at (616)979-1858 24 hrs 7 days   300-14400 bps.

   I have been working on this for a WHILE now, I have MOST of the program
modules on-line and have 3 test sites running this package, so far so good!
I believe this is the 'most advanced' BBS package EVER assembled for the Coco
and/or the OS9 system, and YES, it may sound like I am bragging but hey, I
think this system is really something to brag about!!  :)     This system
is NOT a 'hacked' version of RIBBS, ALPHASOFT, OS9/LII, or RICS BBS packages
but one that I have updated and changed WITH the consent of the original
authors and have their permission to 'do what I want with it' so, here we
come!!!!

   Any questions about the software??? I'll answer what I can(some things still
under development). Any comments about what you'd like to see? I'll try to
put it in here for ya! As I am NOT totally familiar with the other software
packages out there for Coco Based BBS's, I only have 'feedback' to go by on
what the others do, Hope I didn't step on anyones toes or offend anyone.
Any complaints? Pipe them to /NIL!!!!!

I've tried to call your BBS a few times since reading your message.  It's
been busy, so I know it's possible to get through, but the times I've gotten
carrier, I get the CONNECT 14400 message, and then nothing happens.  Is there
anything special I need to do, or type, to get the BBS's attention?  Thanks.

  Terry,

  Don't know about the `501' but, the old controllers used a 8K
chip.  The Moto numbers were: MCM 68764 and the MCM 68766.
The 68766 was the faster one (350 ms) I think.. It's been a
few years sense I used them :).

As far as I know they is not around no longer ...<<Reason Why rat shack>
changed the Controller to 28 pin......The 24pin ones were no longer made.
and VERY hard to find now....most everyone I know uses the 28 pin kind..
and anyone with a 24pin controller has modified it to run a 28 pin ROM!

Are there any patches to DACIA? I am using a 6552 pak (an Eliminator)
and have noticed a bit choppier "feel" to telecomming with it, my
standard 6551 (tandy deluxe pak) with SACIA is _seems_ smoother..is it
my imagination, or is SACIA simply a better driver (or is it the Eliminator)
.I am not losing chars, it just looks choppy, but then, I am not complaining
(I cant POSSIBLY complain, I WAS using the bitbanger for awhile)

Just wondering if there is a patch or 2 to throw in, and also, what
bugs/problems can I expect?

Does anyone have any idea what keypress sequence to use as the esc char for
internet? I find I can go to another window and use display to send a $1c to
t2, but somehow thats seems a bit cumbersome, we oughta have it avail from
 the coco 3 keyboard, unforch the intuitive set is allready used to get the
backslash itself. Also, I just spent 15 minutes waiting for it to connect
to the old cabralas site, used the display out twice and got an "illegal
sequence" error out of internets shell both times. Should I have gotten
that?

   Try sending a ^Y  that's a Control Y.   That's what InfoXpress sends

  Hummm.  I use the quotes as:  cd "COCO3"
Did you use the end quote ?  I've missed that a few times :)
And don't backspace if you make a mistake.  Just type a new line..
