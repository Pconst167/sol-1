Subject : Wanted: Cross Assembler
Date    : 94/03/27  23:35:00

(Crossposted to COCO,MM1_TECH,OS9,RIBBS via EnMasse v2.31)
 
WANTED:
------
 
What: 6800/6802/6808 cross assembler to operate in OS9/6809 (preferred)
      or MSDOS environment.
 
Why:  Rewrite of the Puppo 101-keyboard (not Eagle, sorry) interface
      software.
 
Some of the possible enhancements include:
 
- TAB becomes shift-right (presently right)
- shift-TAB becomes shift-left (presently left)
- END becomes shift-HOME (presently break)
- SCROLL LOCK becomes ctrl-s (presently ` ($60))
- PAUSE BREAK becomes break (presently not translated)
- PRINT SCRN SYSREQ becomes macro key (presently F10)
- F11 becomes alt-i (presently not translated)
- F12 becomes alt-j (presently not translated)
 
Extreme enhancements (not necessarily possible/probable):
 
- show PASS/FAIL status of keyboard self-diagnostic on reset
- re-init keyboard on reset (clear caps/num/scroll lock)
- toggle QWERTY/DVORAK layouts & re-init (hot keyed - change on the fly)
 
(NOTE: None of the above enhancements are 'cast in stone'.  If you have
       an idea you would like to include, post a message in this echo.)

Alan,
  OSKBOX is a fully Amatuer Radio Packet Mailbox, with auto fowarding
and retreiving of mail. It will run on either a 68000,68070, or 68020
system.

Dear Warren:
    Calvin Dodge called me with a small patch to Kterm which he said
would allow the program to process control codes in a slightly different 
way.  I think it was a byte at a time rather than as a string.  This
seemed to make the screen responsive to changes on a word by word basis.
Now I can use a vt100 emulation on a local library service and have both 
bold highlighted words and regular text alternating on the screen.
Before the poke all I would have is bold text for everything.
   Calvin made the change because he was having problems with the host
line editors messing up and he said this helped them work.  You might
try communicating with him on FIDO.  I think he uses the same local BBS
that I do, although I have not received a reply to my last message to
him.   Also, I did hear from David Graham about windio51.  He said it
was forwarded to me on may 28th.  I still havent seen it yet so I
checked to see if it was here.  Quess Not.
   Thanks very much,
    George

George,
       This may be related to the latest bug that has been fixed in the
commercial version of Kterm.  John A Donaldson said it was apparent when 
the host sent a string of ANSI cntrl codes and the 2nd and/or 3rd ones
would be ignored.  It should work well now as it has been tested on my
RiBBS system and David Graham has tested it on MS Dog BBS's also.
       It should be available in a few weeks as soon as David gets the
docs rewritten. It will be on sale from BlackHawk, Me and at the
Chicago Fest.

Subject : UUCP
Date    : 94/04/06 09:39:10

John,
     I just saw a msg. from Boisy Pitre on the OS9ECHO concerning Bob
Billson's UUCP port.  He says it is uploaded to the OS9 site on
chestnut.cs.wisc.edu and should be available there and on the mirror
site, wuarchive soon.  He says 'for OSK you need an earlier version of
LHA V2.01. which I have. It is supposed to compile with the C compiler
V3.2 or Ultra C.
     He says it allows running a UUCP node but is not a terminal
program.  One still needs to connect to an Gateway or somesuch Internet
system.  Anyway it is a big step for us MM/1 users (providing no bugs)
and I hope you can pick it up and it will compile ok.
     Boisy's msg is dated 94/04/05 at 1:15 AM.
Note that Bob Billsons's Internet address is (bob@kc2wz.bubble.org)

Subject : UUCP stuff
Date    : 94/04/08 08:42:41

Some new files I have for download and also are available on the OS9CN
libraries are ;
LTERM10d.lzh  (Alan Westons MM/1 term program)  [osk_tel section]
UUCPBB20.lzh  (Bob Billson's latest release)      "   "     "
UUCPBM20.lzh  (docs for above)                    "   "     "
README.ubb    (A uucp readme file, what else)     "   "     "
 
The lterm is a nice term program for the MM/1 but does not include Ansi.
  (it is a demo version of a shareware program)
BTW I did test my beta version of Kterm and Zyxel modem using zmodem and 
got over 2,000 CPS on downloading from a Wildcat Ms Dos BBS.  And Kterm
has a nice ANSI setup now.  I have a color config that makes RiBBS look
good.
The UUCP stuff was received over the OS9CN network and was orginated by
Brian Stewart, Thanks Brian. Now to see if I can compile it on my MM/1.
There is a makefile for the MW C compiler I have so maybe it will be a
go.
Anyway look for the above new files at Ocean Beach BBS in the OSK_TEL
section, and on other Libraries in the OS9_TEL section.  BTW there is
makefiles for both CoCo OS9 Lev2 and OSK V3.2 C compiler.
There is also a makefile for MW's Ultra C compiler.

I picked up the UUCPbb package yesterday, compiled it (40 minutes for the 
compile), and fired it up today.

Haven't got it sending mail, but I can receive mail right now. Haven't figured

out all the stuff related to news groups yet though.

At any rate, it's the best-documented UUCP package for OS-9 I've seen yet.

Subject : ladial demo version
Date    : 94/04/09 14:48:10

If you've gotten the ladial demo version to work, I'd like to hear from
you about how you did it.  I suspect my "modem init" string; as far as I 
can tell, my modem comes up in an appropriate mode, so that all I have
in my dial.sys file for the "init strings" are "DT<phone number>".  The
bps rate for all of them is 38400, because I have my modem set up to
always communicate at that rate whatever the other end talks at--but I
haven't gotten that far, so I don't know whether that will cause a
problem.
 
The symptoms I see are that ladial emits the "init string" and then
comes back immediately with NO DIALTONE.  If I let it redial, it just
goes offhook and I eventually get a warning message and howler tone
(what they play to let you know your phone in the other room is off hook 
and not doing anything).  Any advice would be appreciated.  LaTerm looks 
very nice, and the external protocol setup is something we've needed for 
a long time.  I just need to figure out how to get it to actually dial.

Colin,
      The UUCP came over the OCN distribution net.  I had it balk on
compile at rmail.c and found an extra space at line 1030 in that.
After fixing that it compiled fine.  Now I have been trying to connect
to a local UNIX system and we cant get it to recognize his (l)ogin and
send my site name and password.  I have been able to call my BBS and
send my name and password but of course the rest is glorp as RiBBS just
thinks it is a user.
     Maybe tomorrow we can get it working better.
Warren, (warren_hrach@f343.n202.z1.fidonet.org)

Oh no!  Yes, it's version 1.8 of the math module!!  Two more bugs have
been found (thanks to Bob van der Poel).  I'm uploading the new version
now - it should be available on this board Real Soon Now.  Sorry for
the mess!
