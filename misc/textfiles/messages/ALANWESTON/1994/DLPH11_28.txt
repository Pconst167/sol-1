You are correct about the caution, Rick.  I have only owned an Italian 250cc -
it's so long ago that I remember almost nothing about it.  However, a
penetrating lubricant such as the new "moleculars" would probably glaze and
render the clutch inop. "...until all that crap finally..." wears out -
moleculars are NOT going to rinse out - at LEAST "...20 plates down the
road.." if that clutch uses the engine oil as clutch coolant.

Thanks.

   Is the next version still open for requests ?

   Could you add a quick record menu option ? It would work something like
   this..

       The QUICK record function would be initially disabled, until the
   frequency and length have been set for the first time, then it would be
   enabled. Clicking on the QUICK record option would use the same settings
   that were entered the last time the REGULAR record function was called.
       Just a little step saver.

Hi Larry!

   Yeah, sounds like a good idea! I'll take a look in the source code and
see how work-able it would be. Tho I think I might assign some defaults for
use if the current settings aren't changed. Like 2 seconds at 1125 hertz
(Many files I've seen use that speed).

   Chris,
       Sounds good, (is that a pun?), I have been playing around with
   different things trying to get some good sound effects recorded and
   I find having to select the menu, select record, type 'y', then enter
   the same speed and time values that I have been entering for the last
   hour. Would it be possible to add another button for the quick record,
   so that you wouldn't have to go through the pull-down menu. You could
   have a record setting option in the pull-down that lets you set the
   values for quick record or the default settings, and then you would
   only need to click on the button to start recording.

   Was that 1125 hertz or 11250 hertz, I'm suprised at the low sample
   rate.

       Ok, Chris, give it some thought, I know that you are currently
   working hard on the CD read routines, and I don't want to pull you
   off that, but I also know that programmers like to get feedback on
   their programs.

       On a related subject, there was some talk about some change
   in ss_record to allow the use of memory outside of the 1 meg video
   ram, has this been done yet ? That "can't get enought memory" prompt
   is a bummer on a 9 meg machine ;-)

     CD Rom Drives
     From: HAWKSOFT     To: ALL

Hi All!

  I've found a source for refurbished external CD Rom Drives (bare, so to
speak). Using these drives (CDR25J), I would be able to sell a complete
Plug and Play CD Rom Kit. Would anyone (everyone?) be interested???

Kit would include:

   External NEC CD Rom Drive
   Power Supply
   Adapter Cable (from internal SCSI cable to back-plane mount DB-25. Mounts
                   in printer cut-out on back of computer.)
   External Cable (from DB-25 to CD Rom Drive)
   Descriptor
   Driver
   File Manager
   Audio CD Software ( Virtual CD Player )


    Cost would run about $150 complete incuding U.S. Shipping.


    Requires OSK computer with a WD33c93 (or WD 33c93A) SCSI interface.

  If there is enough interest, I can have them available in a few weeks.

If Phillips is up to par with following up, you might get an ad from them.
I received one where they offer the FMV cartridge at $250 and I would get a

Hey Allen,

Glad to hear that you picked up a CD-i player.  Did you get the 550 model?

There are several companies that have discount prices on titles.  One is
called Video F/X, but I don't have their number right now.  Perhaps someone
with an issue of CD-i Magazine can look it up and post their number?

Philips does have an order line; however, they sell titles at full
retail price, so it is advantageous for you to find a reseller who
sells below retail.  Here's a message that you might find interesting:

Dear Forum Members,

I am pleased to announce that as of today, Monday, October 31, 1994, a group at
Philips Interactive Media in Los Angeles is responsible for all support of
Philips Media CD-i and CD-ROM software products in the United States. (Those
outside the US should obtain support from the Philips organization in the local
country.)  The telephone number for this group is 800 340 7888; this is the
number that will be on software packaging in the US from now on.

This new group is comprised of experienced CD-i software support personnel, a
PIMA product test veteran and some new employees. We are able to answer gneral
consumer questions about CD-i, about specific titles in both CD-i and CD-ROM
formats, about title availability, and we can take orders, and give gameplay
hints. We can also send an information package to prospective developers.

Phone hours for the new software support group are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. M, T, W,
and F; 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, Pacific
Time.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions about US phone support
for Philips CD-i and CD-ROM titles.

We look forward to supporting our CIS forum friends,

Lucy Lediaev
Director, Customer Support
Philips Interactive Media

P.S. CD-I hardware and accessory support is available from Philips Consumer
     Electronics at 800 531 0039.

Hi Al!!

   I'm hoping that it is driver independant (in true OS9 fashion)!!
Ed Gresik is trying it out on the System IV & V. And, Bob D der P is going
to give it a go on a VME system. I've got my fingers crossed!!!!

You can write Motorola and get any of their spec sheets. The only 6809 boards
made at this time are controller boards. I do have the address of one company
who makes a board that uses simple address decoding. Marty Goodman
(MARTYGOODMAN)
has been working on converting one to nearly emulate a CoCo so that a CoCo could

be used as a development system. It wouldn't be able to address all RAM though
(32K max, I think).

Hi Gene;
   I have been able to do most of the blob patches but still am having trouble
with getting boot6_sl_63 patch to work When i try to reboot it will start
loading ( I start with a floppy then most of the boot is from HD- moved CC3GO)
then it will do alittle loading from the HD then hangup. So I am still
working with that.
  I noticed in your first MYRAM file that when I install the driver then
do a IDENT onit where it should show 6809 obj code it shows (????) and when
I do a MDIR E it will show - r.?. - in the attr column. The ram disk
works fine but does show thise. I also wondered shouldn't there be at
least 1 cylinder allocated in the  r0  module   When I do a dmode on /r0
 i get cyls=0 sectrk=5760 (etc).
           I could not find your krnlutils in the data base.

The weird ident is because ident doesn't recognise a module which is set
in its atrv and tyla bytes to be a native mode 6309 coded module. The
same comment re mdir e. I wonder what dmode you are using, its not doing
it the same as mine obviously. cyls should be 0 ok, but sectrk in mine
is 'sct' and it reports in hex insteada decimal. Thats the only variable
that actually counts though. As far as the krnlutils goes, I'll check the
database and get back to ya in a sec.

Cheers for now, Gene

if you running native mode, i skipped the 6309 patch for the BOOT module
on my main CoCo i didn't need to BLOB proof it at all since im using
Sdisk 3.3-DMC for my disk driver. My Second CoCo3 was the BLOB problem
I just replaced the cc3disk module with the patched one. I went through
and changed the ty/la back to 6809 object since ident couldn't
identify it. I have not seen the BLOB on the second coco since then

I also noticed replacing the RBF module with edition 33 (6309, multicluster
and undel) i got 18 second megareads from both hard disks, where before
only the first hard disk would do 18 sec, go figure!

Hi Mike; I take it that rbf ed33 is working for you. I hadn't heard, which
I guess is good news! 18 seconds for both drives is also good, I wonder
what I did to make them equal speeds. Thats 13 secs on my own Maxtor 7120s
here, so I must come to the conclusion that the disto is quicker, unless
this Maxtor is. I doubt that inasmuch as the drives are all able to move
250+k a second when tied to an Amiga, and often in the megabyte/sec area!
BTW, my 'vfy' will properly identify those modules with the 'munged' atrv
and tyla bytes! Theres a LOT it can do if you haven't yet checked it out.
Glad to hear its working for someone else besides me. Have you reformatted
one of them for mutliple sector clusters yet, or were you already doing them
with ed 28?
Cheers, Gene

I just don't know what to think.  I paid $439 for an Epson LQ-870, thought
I'd go with the "best".  It had a 2 year warranty, and would you believe?
2 years and ONE month the logic board went out, or so the service people
said.  A replacement, refurbished board was about $230 installed.  With
so much invested in the printer, I felt I almost had to try to get my
money's worth.  I could have bought almost 3 cheaper printers for the
original cost and the repair cost.  I've decided that it might be best
to just buy cheaper printers and "Timex" them when they go bad.  Of course,
lasers might be a different story.

Tim,

   I really am not familiar with what the output of the current lowest
priced xerographic printers looks like.  HOWEVER... I can say that
IN GENERAL, I've never seen a decent, working xerographic printer
output (300 dpi standard minimum) that EVER looked worse than
the very BEST 300 or 360 dpi ink jet output.  This because
the ink jet process, tho refined considerably, still produces
a characteristic "ink blurring".   This makes print out,
in my opinion, always poorer than xerographic (laser or LED) printers.

Tim, the only problem with low-cost laser printers is the print speed and
low memory. They usually have no more than 512K and print at 4 pages per
minute. If you do a lot of printing, lasers are MUCH cheaper than any other
printer. Drawback is high initial cost and cost of new cartridges ($70 or more)
. Cartridges print 5,000-10,000 pages though, sometimes more. If you are using
the laser for text based applications, the memory is no problem. Add on
average $150 for an additional meg of memory if you want to do graphics from
an IBM compatible, or wiat a LONG time!!

Ink jets don't stand up well to lots of use. With lasers now coming closer
to ink-jet prices, the only consideration is space. The small lasers can't
be as compact as the ink-jets. The only other problem with lasers is the
possibility of jarring the mirrors and other parts when moving. So if you
move it a lot, get an LED laser printer. These use a laser LED array rather
than a rotating mirror and are much more robust and compact.

I work with a lot of lasers here on the USAF base. We have many old Wang
LBP-8 printers (old LJ II clones) that probably have millions of pages on them
already with no problems other than cleaning and maybe some paper feed
rollers. Inkjets, on the other hand, don't stand up to that kind of use.
Our 2 year old printer has almost 20,000 pages on it (actually about 20 months
old).
It has only gone through two $80 cartridges (this is a big 15 ppm printer!).

 Sounds to me like someone at EPSON should be fired - supposed to fail after
 2 years and one DAY <g>.

 Seriously, I've stuck with OKIDATA for dot matrix printers.  I have a couple
 that are almost 10 years old and still perform quite well - just replace
 ribbons.  They're used in the store and get pretty heavy use on a daily
 basis.

 Re Lasers - I have a TANDY 950 which I used for quite a while.  Supposed
 to be HPL2 compatible and it was, mostly.  Recently, I got an HP 4+.  Some
 of the code I used wouldn't work right - found that the TANDY wasn't
 compatible in those areas.  Also had similar problems with several clients
 that used laser printers that were supposed to be HPL(n) compatible.  Not
 all laser printers claim HP compatibility.  But, I don't believe HP is the
 standard although some laser printer manufacturers claim compatibility.
 Don't know that there is a 'standard' for printer languages.

 As to reliability, most lasers use the same engine and I haven't run into
 problems with the engines.  Paper handling is different for each manufacturer
 and some seem to have more problems than others.  But I've had no problems
 with either the TANDY or the HP.

 I think the big difference between the various manufacturers will be the
 availability of supplies; the toner cartridge and/or drum.  Several of my
 clients have tried third party toner cartridges (so have I) and have been
 unhappy with the results.  Part of the decision regarding purchasing a
 laser printer is to consider the availability of parts and supplies many
 years down the pike.

According to the info I have on the disto. The Disto port uses the
address range $FF40-$FF5F. remember the disk controller (even the RS one)
isn't decoded properly so it ghosts several times in the map.

There is an alternative! If you want to mount the PIA inside the CoCo itself
with one chip you can fully decode the internal pia, and then use one of its
ghost slots for a new PIA.

Mike,
  The information I have in my SC2 manual says that the MEB (mini expansion bus)

is 8 bytes mapped into $FF50 to $FF57, which is not normally available due to
the ghosting.  The SC2 properly decodes this area.
  Your alternative sounds intrigueing!  I have heard of such a mod, ie
piggybacking
a PIA on the coco motherboard but I haven't had the addresse for the internal
PIA's and where they ghost to.  Since eventually I am going to upgrade an old
style RS controller to do high density, I was going to build both parallel
port cards, one to mount in the SC2 and one thats plugs into the MPI for when
I finally do the HD hack.  (Your PIA file has been very instructional and was
the inspiration for building the PIA card for my SC2!)  Could you give me some
more
info on the internal PIA?  Thanks for your help!

Well its slightly different for a CoCo1 vs CoCo3. The CoCo3 isn't as bad
with ghosting. The CoCo3 ghosts go like this

 $FF00 pia ghosts to $FF04,$FF08,$FF0C
 $FF20 pia ghosts to $FF24,$FF28,$FF2C

this means the A2,A3 lines need to be accounted for. the internal PIA's
don't use CS1, its tied high, so cut the trace out of CS1 then take a
NOR gate and feed A2,A3 into the inputs, the output goes to CS1.
That fully decodes the PIA. Then is pretty simple to piggyback a new
PIA into the old ghost slots.

Hi Rick,

command such as "display 1b 31 4 1" means to make palette register
#4 the value of 1, right?  A friend worked on this and gave it to me as
well.  He figured I would like it, and I do.  It keeps the various parts

do have a 32Mhz crystal.  Will it work?  Is there going to be any kind
of tweeking to be done to say, the monitor?  What about the MPI?  At
the time that I swapped my 6809 for the 6309, I knew, from all that I
had read, that it was an even swap.  I had no problem with that.  I
mounted a socket and dropped in the 6309, and away I flew.  Well,
I think that might be enough questions for now.  See ya.

Thanks, Stephen, I got feedback from Bob Van Der Poel and Pete Lyall over
on CIS, saying the same.. well, actually, all I did was zero out EKO..
Learned something there.. didn't realize that the EKO would cause the system
to echo back to the modem, in this case.. I thought it would send it to the
screen, or whatever was path 1.

What I was trying to do was get an external autodialer up and running.. Got
it to get the connect, but now find out that there are already autodialers
available, but apparently have been put in archives or something..  There
are some for OS9 but I couldn't find any for OSK.

Well, I think I'm on the right track now, if I continue, may just wait and
see what's available.  No use re-inventing the wheel  <G>

How are you liking UCC?  I may try another compiler, no real problems with
3.2, but thought I might give either GNU a try or get UCC.  Haven't done
much programming yet.

 I'm not sure exactly what has to be zeroed in the scf path descriptor and
 waht makes no difference - I just set everything to zero.  I'm open to being
 educated.

 I think it great.  A bit slower to compile than 3.2.  If I turn off
 optimization (-x=aoio) it take about 10% to 20% longer than 3.2 to compile
 the same program after porting for UCC mode.  With the optimization set to
 default it take 1 1/2 to 2 times as long.  Small price to pay for the
 greater flexiblity and the finished code runs noticeably faster.

 Once you get used to the differences, porting applications over to OS9000 is
 much easier too.  So far, I've found that the I$Sleep and I$Create calls are
 different and the scf path structures are different.  Oh yea, the global
 pointer void *_glob_data isn't documented :-)

 From now on, just about everything I post will be compiled with UCC.  I'm
 porting most of my G-Windows stuff for recompilation to OS9000.

Well...as time goes on, more and more code is going to be written assuming
an ANSI/ISO C compiler.  Either GCC or Ultra C will help in that regard.
They both generate better code than the 3.2 compiler, though of course,
doing so does take CPU time and memory.

I don't know what the people distributing GCC are doing for libraries.
Initially, I think the OS-9/68000 version was set up to use the 3.2
compiler's libraries, though that wouldn't suffice for ANSI conformance,
since ANSI adds a lot of library functions and adds bells and whistles to
the commonly-found functions.

If you intend to develop a commercial product and are thinking of using
GCC, IMHO you had better read the GPL VERY carefully.

Opinions herein are solely those of their respective authors.

RE the GPL - from what I can see, the GNU folks have learned a little,
and the developer now has little to worry about using GCC to develope
commecial software.   The last GCC library contained mods to make it much more
ANSI compatible, and the library is
growing more powerful over time.  Of course, the GCLIB code is available

 Suggest you enlist the services of a good legal beagle experienced in
 copyright law as it applies to software.  The last word I've received is
 that you still cannot charge for programs using their libraries and you
 must make the source code available to anyone requesting it.  Also, you
 are placing at risk customers that purchase software using the GNU libraries.
 Of course, you can get a license (for cash money) from the GNU people
 negating these risks and requirements.

 GCC has not been ported to OS9000/386.  UCC has and it isn't a major task
 porting stuff written in UCC from OS-9 to OS9000.  Further, when the PowerPCs
 become available, MW will have OS9000 and Ultra C ready to go.  So far as I
 know, the only C-Compiler will be UCC - at least for a while.

 All of the above aside.  One of the complaints members of this community
 have made is that MW isn't providing adequate support.  Don't you think these
 complaints would have more merit if members of this community supported MW?
 Maybe MW would support the personal market better if the personal market
 supported them - just a thought.

 Don't know of a stand alone dialer but there are several comm packages that
 include dialers.  Check out 'aterm' - dialer in there works well but is
 written in assembler.  Also, check the new UUCPb port.  It includes code for
 dialing and auto-logon.  Works quite well.

 PAGAN, in message #90810, covered the advantages of UCC pretty well.  I had
 looked at using the GNU compiler several years ago from a legal viewpoint.
 According to the legal beagles, you may not sell software compiled by GNU
 if you use the GNU libraries.  And you are required to either provide, or make
 available at no charge, the source code.  (You are permitted a nominal charge
 to cover copying and shipping costs.)  I'm not aware of a port of the GNU C
 Compiler to OS9000 - something I consider essential today.  If you are
 considering the PowerPC as a platform in the future, then UCC is the way to
 go.  IMO, I don't believe MW will port 3.2 and whether someone will do a GNU
 port is unknown.  One other thing and for what it's worth to you, MW is
 working on making UCC Posix compatible.

 To elaborate on PAGAN's comments re speed.  The ports I did of G-WINDOWS
 for the SYSTEM's IV and V were done using 3.2.  Replacing certain functions
 with assembler resulted in speed increases between 2 and 3 times.  Under
 OS9000, I've had similar speed improvements re UCC vs 3.2.  The driver was
 compiled under UCC giving no weight to size and maximum weight to speed.
 I don't know if I could improve performance using assembler - the assembler
 listings (under UCC) looked pretty good.  On the other hand, I'm not very
 experienced with Intel assembler code.

 Support may be another factor.  MW has done a pretty good job of supporting
 Ultra-C.  If you don't have a maintenance contract, they won't be cooperative
 after 90 days for phone support but they have been responding to e-mail.  I'm
 not aware of any support (except from other users) for the GNU C Compiler.

     MM/1 monitor compatibility
     From: MMCCLELLAND  To: ALL

   Can somebody tell me if the MM/1 works properly with monitors that can
only sync down to a horizontal frequency of 31.5 KHz? I will be buying a
monitor in the near future, and I need one which will be MM/1 compatible. I
have heard that the MM/1 is switchable between 15.75 and 31.5 KHz, but that
the current drivers cannot support the latter frequency.

     RE: MM/1 monitor compatibility (Re: Msg 90806)
     From: BOISY        To: MMCCLELLAND (NR)

Hi there,

The MM/1 needs a monitor that can sync at 15.75 KHz.  Any monitor that
won't sync that low will not work.  If you're looking for a good monitor
that works on the MM/1, CoCo 3 and a PC compatible, you might want to
check out the SONY CDP-1302.  Mine is 14", .25 dot pitch, 800x600 res.,
and works absolutely great with my MM/1.  In fact, I can bring in the picture
and see the entire overscan screen.  David Graham (NIMITZ) can give
you information on the SONY monitors that he is selling.  I highly recommend
it.  You will not find a sharper picture on an MM/1 or CoCo 3, plus it's
switchable between analog and digital RGB.

True, the VSC in the MM/1 can do 31.5 KHz, but the trade off is that the
horizontal resolution is halved.  And K-Windows does not support the 31.5
KHz mode, so you're stuck with having to buy a monitor that syncs down
to 15.75 KHz

Good luck.

 Subj:   CoCo 3 Emulator,   IMPORTANT

 Well, with others putting out notices about the CoCo 3 emulator,
there are a few things I feel I should post to clear up:
  1. The CoCo 3 emulator is available only by registration.

  2. Registration info is found in the *new* ver 1.40 release of
the CoCo 2  emulator, which should appear on SimTel FTP mirror
sites shortly.  The file is coco2-14.zip (*not* coco2-13.zip).
One SimTel site is oak.oakland.edu, the directory is
pub/msdos/emulator.

  3. Those who contributed to Rick Cooper's CoCo Emulator Bounty
Escrow Fund will receive credit up to the full value of the
registration fee, $25.   (I'm taking the monthly report in CFDM's
Forum as authoritative on who contributed, and how much.  Please
contact Rick if there is any error in your entry in this report.)

4. Those who contributed in excess of the $25 to the Fund will
receive a typeset printed version of the manual with their copy.
(This is a bounus available *only* to those who contributed to the
Fund in excess of $25.)

5. Those who did not contribute to the Fund may obtain a copy of
the emulator for $25 by following the instructions in Section 8 of
the CoCo 2 emulator's documentation.
 (The file is COCO.DOC in coco2-14.zip.)

6. Please take time to follow verify that you have the correct
system requirements by reading the COCO.DOC file and following the
test procedure for your VGA card and disk drives.

Please feel free to repost this message anywhere you can.  There
appear to be rumours and speculation circulating already, which
I'd like to clear up.

 Again, the CoCo 3 emulator is not in itself shareware.  The CoCo
2 emulator is shareware in that, if you register it, you get the
CoCo 3 emulator.  The CoCo 3 emulator is only available to those
who register, and is not freely distributable.
