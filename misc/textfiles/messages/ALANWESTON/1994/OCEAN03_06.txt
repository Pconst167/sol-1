Can you tell if the drive is spinning up? You may take the drive and twist it
slam it into your palm then power it up. If you have a stiction problem this
will usually get it going, at least for a while.

I'll put that idea on my list of priorties.
 
First on my list is getting ZModem RX/TX working.
Second is to fix a minor problem in the ANSI Color Routine.
Third fix YModem TX to be a batch type TX
Forth your idea of switching to the enviorment varible MODEM
Fifth your -? idea.

  Re: dead hard drive
 
  Yep, I've tried going back to an old boot disk, loading up the hard disk
drivers, inizing /h0 etc. No luck. Darn stubborn thing..if nothing else, I
plan to give myself a free lesson on the inside guts of modern hard drives..
  At least I've got a minimal floppy-based system back up, so I can start
re-doing some of the work I lost.
 
 thanks,
 -Russ
