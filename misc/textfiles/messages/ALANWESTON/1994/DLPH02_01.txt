     cabrales
     From: TONYREED     To: ALL


Is it just me and my software or has anyone else had trouble
doing ftp from cabrales (or any other site, ftm) when the file
you're trying to "get" or the directory you're trying
to cd to is upper-case?  I have a feeling that Delphi converts
everything to lower-case, which ain't appreciated in the rarified
Unix world of the Internet

See ya,
Tony

The Internet FTP is case-sensitive, meaning if it is in UPPERCASE you must
type it in uppercase :-). also try enclosing the path in quotes.
 i.e. "DIR/dir/filename". OK? Had to figure that one out when FTP didn't
 "get" a few files for me.

Aha -- quotes!
I _was_ using the case of the target file; I kept getting a
"no such file or directory" response, always lower-case.
I'll try putting quotes around the file-path.

Thanks for the reply,

You have the same version I have, and yes, there is a newer version
out there, at least for DOS users there is. And the ZIP file you have
was apparently zipped up with the new version. For some reason, they
made the default format incompatable with all previous versions of
PKZIP.

I don't know if the original creator of UnZip has modified it to support
the new format yet or not. I don't have it. Wish I did!

I also wish there was a way to stop the _ss_play function in mid-play, but
it still doesn't prevent your program from doing other things while it's
playing.  Perhaps there's some way you can make your program only play parts of
the
sample (say 1 second each) strung together, so you could always stop the play
within a second's time?  (I don't know if this will work, as there may be
noticeable glitches in the sound quality.)

I agree also that Chris Hawks' SOUND program is wonderful!  I like how things
are shown on screen, and how the program works.  I don't know the .IFF sound
file format, and have yet to find someone who does.  Mike Knudsen also wrote
a sound recorder/player program (probably the first on the MM/1) called
RECPLAYS (I believe), and that also saves files with the .IFF file extension,
but the other sounr t this would be like using a sledge hammer to hang wall
board. I would think that _ss_play() would be the place to put some added
signal handleing.
  I can only hope that the keeper of Kwindow's is watching, and that maybe
this problem will be addressed.
  As far as the IFF standards is concerned, maybe we should forget it, and
look for a new standard that is being used and has specifications available.
  On another related subject, do you know anyone that is working on a
program to play Midi files. I don't mean hooking a Midi keyboard up to the
computer and outputing the data to the keyboard. I guess what I'm thinking
of would be a program that would take a Midi file and build up the wave
forms in memory and then send them to _ss_play(). Sounds easy ;-)
  Oh, well

 I disagree with the contention that OS9 _requires_ user understanding and
 input to work.  My daughter uses one of my COCO's all the  time to play OS9
 games with.  She puts in the disk, types "DOS<CR>" and waits for the machine
 to boot.  After bootup a menu is printed to each of the open windows which
 gives her a three letter name to type to start up a game.  After that she
 does have to know how to play the game but her "use" of OS9 is entirely
 transparent to her.

 It's true that I had to create all the scripts and prepare the directories
 and etc. but THAT IS TRUE FOR ANY OPERATING SYSTEM.  Even the, so-called,
 "user friendly" graphic interfaces like the Mac and Windows requires that
 someone who knows what they'rereffor the two systems in your situation
 requires some normalizing for difference in motivation.

 Until I got level II for my first COCO 3 I'd never used OS-9 except for
 Robot Oddessy but, since playing that game never requires any direct
 interaction with the opsys, I don't count it as 'using'.  I, frankly, can't
 understand what the big deal is about learning this stuff.  It didn't take
 me '60-90 days' to learn how to get a system going.

 It's true the manuals aren't up to the quality of, say, Apple's Macintosh
 manuals but then who, besides Apple, is?  The level II manuals were pub-
 lished in 1986 - I didn't see many DOS systems with anything better then
 (actually, I didn't see _any_ DOS manuals I would considersIveen wondering about lately.

Actually, since those are programs that generate code, one could run them
on an OSK machine and move the generated code over to a 6809 to compile.

(A look over at the 68xxx versions shows flex and byacc running about
44-48K, so it might be possible to get them running on a 6809, though
I'm not sure how much memory they use while running, so it may well be
a tight fit.)

Thankx for the Info.  Might be incentive to get a 68xxx box, but then that
would pretty much take care of my desire to get a 6309 compiler then.  Oh
well.  I've been thinking about playing around with Bison to see what I can
do to it.  Should be able to shave some code off, or split it up into a
couple of executables.  It'd be slow, but then so is my CoCo.  :-)

WElp... Lb ht hard to
 > write, actually.

Actually, it is very difficult to write.  Bill Dickhaus, the author of
InfoXpress, has spent a couple years perfecting it.  The problem is all
the different prompts and error messages you need to be expecting.

Here is my standard blurb on InfoXpress:

---------------------

InfoXpress is an program for automated access to Delphi and CIS.  Once
you setup the init file, you normally run InfoXpress from cron to call
up Delphi and CIS in the middle of the night.  It will download all
you waiting email (even binaries) and then go into each forum you have
specified (there can be many) and download all the messages there. When
you get up in the morning, all your messages are waiting.  You can then
view them, and make replies.  The replies are queued up and when InfoXpress
logins in the next time, your replies are uploaded, and then InfoXpress
goes and collects all the mail and forum messages again.

There are lots of features in InfoXpress, including keeping a hiar getting it online
of course).  You then browse it like you do the messages and select the
files you'd like to get.  IX will then download them at the next session.

The reason you don't see many bugs is because Steve Wegert is the beta
tester.  I swear, if there is a bug, Steve will find it.  Steve is the
same reason that Sterm is so solid.  If you ever need someone to beta
test your software, you can't find anyone better than Steve.

Right.  I've found that Colin McKay and Paul Fitch do a very good job,
too.  The thing that sets apart a good software tester isn't just finding
the "bugs", but trying to use the software from the perspective of a
customer (different configurations, different options, etc.), and providing
feedback on how to make it better.  Testing software doesn't mean "yes,
I loaded it and it ran OK on my system"!

From what I hear it is true.  Microsoft attempted to buy out Microware
back in 1986.  The main reason was because Microware had a REAL-TIME
operating system, and Microsoft was only MiSery-DOS.  They didn't have
Windows or anything back then.  (I don't consider any version of Windows
before 3.0 a usable product.)  OH, actually Microsoft did have Xenix, but
they never went anywhere with it other than Tandy 6000.  SCO picked up
Xenix (and still sells it) for Intel based systems, but now concentrates
on Unix.  Whoops, kinda got off the subject.
