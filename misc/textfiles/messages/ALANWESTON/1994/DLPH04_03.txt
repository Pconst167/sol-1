We had one here in Michigan several months ago - or so I'm told - I
didn't notice it.  If you are going to have an earthquake, that is
the kind to have -- the kind where you can say: "Hmmm, what was that?".

I had the same problem, I just gave up and use display from another window,

     OS-9 Announcement
     From: JOELHEGBERG  To: ALL


I was just watching the news and, it's official.  Today, in a joint press
release, Apple Computer and IBM Corp. have announced that OS-9 will be the
operating system which will run their new PowerPC computer architectures.
Of xxx
Of course, all existing software in their respective bases will remain
compatible, through emulation software, however the emulation software
will be running under OS-9, and OS-9 will be the controlling software.
This brings a new level of capability to the PowerPC platform and to more
homes where it will be used.  It's multitasking and multiuser capabilities
are far beyond what other operating systems can offer.





























I hope everyone has a great April Fool's Day!!  :)

to use a soldering iron to cool by using negative frequency! The math worked
wonderfully. We all thought it would work! :). You had me going, especially

   Here's some information I got for you.  In the Jameco cat. 941,
page 12, james co part # 24897 listed  MCM68766C35  for $4.95 each.

   This is a 350 ms part. The MCM68764 is slower at 450 ms.
You want the `766' part for disk controller use.  Years ago I tryed
the `764' for disk use.. not fast enought.. go with the 766 in this
case.  Jameco order # only  1 800 831 4242.  On orders less than
$25.00 there's a $5.00 processing fee.  Hope that helps you.

     From: FHOGG        To: ALL

                      NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCMENT

      MONTOR MOUNTED RECHARAGEABLE MAGNETIC FLOPPY DISK HOLDER

                              4/1/94

                                THE

                            "DISK-MAG"

 After 3 years in development the DISK-MAG will be available soon
 to solve the common annoying problem of misplacing floppy disks
 and risking possible damage. The DISK-MAG is placed on the side
 on the computer monitor with velcro tape. The DISK-MAG is
 capable of holding six 5 1/4" floppy disks or three 3.5" floppy
 disks. Multiple DISK-MAGs may be used for those needing larger
 capacity. The DISK-MAGs secret is the incredible holding power of
 the rechargeable magnet made of a special material that gets
 its recharge from the automatic degaussing coil that is in all
 color monitors. This coil is activated at power down and
 normally demagnetizes the monitors metal dot screen. The
 DISK-MAGs special reverse magnet becomes magnetized by this coil
 which is the reverse of what common magnets do. This reverse
 magnetism is then filtered thru our patented circuitry and powers
 the DISK-MAG. Normally a magnet would erase the contents of a
 disk but the DISK-MAGs reverse rechargeable magnet actually
 INCREASES the data integrity of the disk*. Therefore use of the
 DISK-MAG will help insure against data loss while being a
 convenient place to hold your disks.

 We are researching ways of using this technology to insure
 against data loss in tape and hard disk use. In addition we are
 looking into using the technology to recover data inadvertently
 lost thru normal deleting of files etc. Other possible uses are
 restoring old audio tapes.

 Price and availability will be announced soon.

 *The DISK-MAG circuity only attracts the positive magnetic pulse
 or binary '1' in the case of computer data. By attracting the positive
 pulse it increases the power or size of the pulse thereby increasing
 data integrity. The circuit is fairly simple for binary data which is
 1's and 0's. Analog data requires a more sophisticated circuit and
 more research before we can announce a product using this technology.

     Infocom Games for OSK
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

Just thought I would share this with you:

I used to be a big Infocom game fan when I had my CoCo and used RS-DOS
(long ago).  When I moved to OS-9, I didn't play them anymore since
doing so meant going back to RS-DOS.

While fiddling around on chestnut, I ran across an Infocom game
interpretter thatn Brian White had ported to run under OSK.  After
downloading it, I found that Infocom sells "Lost Treasures of Infocom"
Vols. I and II, a compendium of their original games.  After calling
around a few local software shops, I located a place which was selling
both volumes.  Although I just picked up Vol II, there are a ton of
games on both:

Vol I:  Deadline, Suspect, MoonMist, Spellbreaker, Ballyhoo, Infidel,
Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy, Starcross, the Witness, Planetfall,
Suspended, Stationfall, Enchanter, The Lurking Horror, Zork I, Zork II,
Zork III, Beyond Zork, Zork Zero, Sorceror, Suspended

Vol II: A Mind Forever Voyaging, Bureaucracy, Cutthroats, Hollywood
Hijinx, Plundered Hearts, Nord and Burt, Sherlock Holmes, Titan,
Trinity, Wishbringer, Boarderzone, Seastalker

The store that carried them said that they are no longer a hot item.
Vol I was reduced from $69.96 to $39.95.  Vol II was reduced from $39.95
to $19.95.

All that was necessary was to insert the 3.5" MS-DOG disk in my MM/1,
use pcf to copy the .DAT files from each of the four disks, and voila!
I now have 12 games sitting in my GAMES/INFOCOM directory which can
be played at my whim.  The interpretter works flawlessly!  I now have
Infocom games on my MM/1, and it looks really cool.

     MIX
     From: ILLUSIONIST  To: ALL

Does anyone know of a MIX language simulator? (I know it wont be for the coco
but I am really just looking for source) In C,Pascal, or even Basic? MIX
is a language invented by Donald Knuth, and used is his books on computer
science..any help on getting for source for a MIX interpreter would be
greatly appreciated..

Since Knuth uses it for his CS books (and I presume colleges use it also)
try looking around the USENET news groups for a comp.lang.mix group and
posting a message.  If it's available someone there should know.
You might also try a comp.edu group.  Hope this helps.

I'd be very surprised if there weren't a MIX emulator somewhere in the
archives of some comp.sources.* newsgroup.  If you're registered for
Internet access on Delphi, I bet a short session with gopher would find
out where it can be had.

     Cursor Position (Supercomm)
     From: DBREEDING    To: RANDYKWILSON

It's me again...   Been playing with Supercomm.  I don't know whether you
plan on doing a whole lot of development with it or not, but if you do,
I'll send you a little feedback.

I like a lot of its features but I've found and area or two that you might
want to work on.

I've noticed that apparently the GoToXY function, under ANSI emulation is
off by 1, at least in the Y coordinate.  On my local BBS, their editor, in
allowing you to reply to a msg, goes down the original msg line by line
letting you choose to "S"kip or "A"dd.  there is a little ">" prompt.
With Supercomm, when you "ADD" a line, what is added is the line that was
ABOVE it.  It isn't a problem with the BBS, because OSTerm works correctly
in this area.  Doesn't ANSI start with line 1 where OS9 starts with
line 0?

Just thought I'd let ya know.  If you don't object to this, I'll probably
be "feedbacking some more" <G>.  I guess sometimes it gets to be a pain
listening to what seems to be complaints, but I've submitted and had
submitted some work of my own, and I'd have appreciated some feedback
on it.  I know my first edition of "r63" should have not even been posted,
but I didn't use it myself, didn't do any testing and it would have probably
have been real junk had I not met Boisy and heard about one bug, and after
going back in correcting some more.  From what feedback I get now, it is
apparently pretty straight.  I think the beta test stage is the really
important step.

Well, TTYL...

     RE: RAM Full (Re: Msg 86614)
     From: MITHELEN     To: MICHAELJN

This error is caused by running out of space in the 64K block of RAM where
the Kernel resides in memory, called the System RAM. This is seperate/different
then the process RAM, where your programs get loaded. Things that cause
shortage of system RAM is, having lots of unnecessary drivers/descripter etc
in your bootfile, running lots of processes at one time. initializing devices
that were loaded seperate from the bootfile... The first step is to get
"smap" from the Kevin Darlings utility package (some where here on Delphi)
which will tell you how much of the System RAM space your have free. Then,
start stripping worn your boot file toonly necessare modules... and
make sure all the drivers/descriptors your need to uses are in the boot file.
Never load them after boot, as that sucks up 8K of system Ram for each
seperate one loaded (or up to the next 8k boundry)

I just checked the New Catalogue from my supply'er and the caps are $ 0.34
each, and the R65C51P2 chips are $ 12.50 each... But the catalogue had a foot
note stating that prices would change with the demand and the state of the
economy...
So the final price might differ when I finally get them, plus shipping...

I will phone the company tomorrow for a final price check, will also order two
chips to fill CBJ's order...  Will include with every order a copy of my
invoice from my supply'er...

Good news!

I found the problem. I had forgot to enclude the command "shell" to my
cmds directory. I had left it at "shellplus". But now, I get a dir of
my hard drive before the final boot process is finished. I'm wondering
if the boot is looking for CC3go on the drive. Looks like more work for me.

it do!<grin> the INIT module points to it!...Hmmm..I,m powering up!
patch CC3go to point to /H0....

    at the start of the module.......CC3Go.i=/1.SYS/shell.parameters./H0
    ./H0/Cmds.Shell.Startup -P.R
change the /D0 to /H0           or is it /DD<grin>

    offset 02E  44  48    offset 032 44 48
as you may have noticed it is Easy to change...they are both very close

ezgen will do it! just change the TWO bytes ,and don,t forget to reset the
CRC.....when you change it
your Module CRC should be same as mine $4F7BC8


        Header for:  CC3Go
        Module size: $0117     #279
        Module CRC:  $4F7BC8   (Good)

        Prog mod, 6809 obj, re-en, R/O

You HAVE to use the Disk<grin> the INIT module goes the the CC3Go module
where ever it is<ON the Disk> then it sends everything to the hard drive...

It is a little hard to say.  I use an Olivetti M240 at work (these are the
AT&T computers under the original manufacturer's name.)  Nfortunately ther are
a number of variants.  nAn M240 has an 8086  (heavy on the six) running at
10 MHZ. There is an older version running at 8 MHZ.  The machine you are
looking at is probably one of these.  They have been very solid machines.
Mine is about 6 years old in daily service.  Beware the clock - Olivetti
had a driver which runs the real time clock which was only valid for 8 years
from 1984.  Ie in 1993 it refused to get the year correct.  There is a patched
version available - I have it - Check the machine you are considering.
Oh yes - the clock battery will be approximately dead with a capital D and will
need replacing.  Interesting design.  You get at the motherboard from the bottom

of the computer.!.
If cheap - consider it a good quality XT with a 640 x 400 monochrome graphics
mode - makes Geoworks (geos) quite tolerable.
