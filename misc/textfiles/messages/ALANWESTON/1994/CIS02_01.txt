Steve, I am a COCO owner who relies exclusively on OS-9 for his 6809 box. On
the other end of the bench is a VLB 486DX2/66 loaded with software development
tools, and I use that one to make my living on.

OS-9 (and OS-9000) is a good multitasking operating system with real-time
interrupt servicing.  It is also multi-user, and that makes it unusual. You
don't usually see a multi-user, multitasking operating system that can process
its interrupts in realtime.

However, as much as I hate the OS/2 operating system, it is possibly a
best-choice for real-time data acquisition systems that need to multitask. My
reasoning is as follows:  Windows, though it does multitask, does it in a
non-preemtive manner.  A task runs until it either finishes or surrenders
control so that other tasks may have a slice of the CPU's time. OS-9, while a
good possible choice for data acquisition, is not as well supported by third
party vendors as OS/2 is, though that isn't saying much. UNIX is pretty much
out because it doesn't process interrupts in realtime. The only real drawback
is that OS/2 is a single user operating system, and that if anything goes wierd
with it it's harder to track down than it is with OS-9.

Most of the industrial control devices I've had to work with over the last two
years have been based on OS/2 1.3 Extended, for whatever its worth.

Hi Steve,
I'm using OS-9 Profesional on 68030/040 mashines. I'm a softwaredesigner for a
german OEM of VMEbus-boards.
Is there anything interesting for me out there. I've been at EFFO,
and they've got some interesting things (workaround for the 040-IRQ-bug
for the clib.l ...).
Are you guys working on such things?
Tee!

See you
Martin Raabe

Anyone know where sources for a GNU C/C++ compiler and GAS assembler
for os-9 or cd-rtos might reside?  PLEASE!!!!!

If I can't find it I'll have to drive the Broken L.A. Highway system to work -

A fate worse than being un-dead!!!

Hello again (Is there anybody out there ??!!)

I got an internal linker error message from OS9  C cross-compiler V3.2 for
MS-DOS environment.

**** l68: error - jmp total > guess (1/0) in USP_trap_a referencing usp_call in
nmuspsw_c ****

Below you can find a listing showing the linker input.
Might be caused by too many files ?? (I didn't invent this module structure,
but unfortunately have to use it !!)


Regards, and thanks for the tips...
  Hannu
