If SCII means Super Controller II (the Disto product), I have had a
conversation with Ken-Ton and seen in print the statement that a
SC II and a Kenton Hard Drive Interface will not work together on a
Y-cable. Capacitance problem I believe.

do you have the ROM in a socket? or the cpu!other thing is the memory board
if it goes down too far it can short out on the cover ,bottom of the board!

Two, actually--I have an MM/1a and a VME133 system (which has a 12 MHz 68020
and 68881, 3 Mbytes of RAM, and a 40 Mbyte hard drive).  It's been a long time
since I turned on the VME133, though.  Hooking it up to the MM/1a via a serial
port or two is something I keep intending to do.  If I could connect my
printer to the VME box, and if GhostScript didn't eat so much RAM, I'd want
to hook up one port to the VME's /term, and have Ghostscript running and
taking input from the other port.

Well, I may get hissed and booed here, but "scred" might be the ticket.  It
does have some disadvantages, but it does have terminal support.  It uses its
own terminal capability file (termset).  It will not wrap lines, and displays
only one screenwidth, and it has a limit for line-length, and will concatenate
lines longer than that length.

There is one bug in "scred".  In command mode, most alt-key combinations will
crash the system.  I have fixed that bug, it's available here or if you can't
find it and wish to use scred, let me know and I'll send it to ya.  All that's
*really* required is a one-byte patch, plus CRC fix, I added a couple other
byte-changes, though.

I looked in my "ved" docs, and apparently, it does not do terminal support, or
at least I couldn't find mention.  I would have thought it would...

Yes, DynaStar was written to support various terminals through a "termset"
file, which contains information describing each supported terminal (user
updatable for different types).

It used to be sold by Frank Hogg (FHL, username FHOGG on Delphi), but I'm
not sure if he still carries the 6809 version or not.  Try asking him
through email (he only checks Forum messages periodically).

  Hi Mike,
  Just thought I would add my 2 cents worth here.  If you go to the
databases, in System OS-9 I think, you can get my patch for the INIT
module which allows the CoCo to boot without leaving CC3GO in memory.
CC3GO is used only once, at boot-up. It is to be relocated to your CMDS
directory.  The patch also takes care of a bug that is in a different
module. I forget the bug and the module off hand, but this patch takes
cares of it.
  One other thought, it would be a very wise idea to keep a logbook
of every hardware modification and software patch/replacement you do.
This will help when tracking down problems that pop up. I hope you
enjoy OS-9 as much or more than I do. I only use it at home exclusivly,
unforytunatly (sp) I must use Messy-Dog at work.

Yeah, give 2 a try.  Of course, I suppose you realize that you have to
format the disk with this ilv.  I believe you will be able to notice a
difference (I have my 5.25 set for this, too).  However, if you want to

 > What is the interleave value for anyway? I've always wondered what it was

Interleave is the arrangements of the sectors on the disk, within the track.
An interleave of 1 puts the sectors in ascending order, 2, you have sector 1
followed by sector 3, then 5, etc.  ilv=3 skips 2 in between, etc.  I think
I'm right, at least in principle (g).

Giving more skip will allow the computer time to do its stuff.  If the ilv
is too small, the sector is passed by the time the computer is ready, and
the disk will have to make a complete revolution (less what's passed) to
get to the sector.

If you have a level 2 system (lvl 1 might support it, not sure), you can
experiment with the interleave with the format command.  Note, the interleave
is established when the disk is formatted.  You can specify different
interleave values with the parameter :<ilv>:, for example try
   "format /d0 :2:"  When you get to the verify stage, where the tracks
are displayed, you can tell the difference in speed.  I believe level 2
came with the ilv set to 3, but I found that 2 was a little faster.

My comparison of better software is not between the PC group and the OS9
group but their better software which is not in any way more talented than
what comes across this sig! The folks here are more committed to OS9 and are
not as mercinary as dog users. In fact the software here is probably a finer
example of programming since much dog software is inefficient with no thought
given to how much space or memory is required! If someone wants to take
exception to that then----! <Phil>

Well, yes, but...OTOH, the time it takes to really polish up a product,
think it through, and make it bulletproof is awfully hard to find for
something you're going to give away--aside from the independently wealthy
or people who can successfully run a guilt trip or claim to be fighting
the evil corporations so that people will give you money a la the FSF.

So, while I respect folks who put (their own!) stuff in the public
domain, I don't begrudge $$$ for those who put effort into a piece of
software.

EXCUUUUUUUUUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!

The whole concept of Shareware is that you voluntarily spend you connect
time to wherever to download some FREE software. *IF* it turns out to be
something you feel you can use, *THEN AND ONLY THEN* does the author of
the Shareware *EXPECT* you to send in a contribution.

Asking for a contribution to the cause *IF AND ONLY IF* you feel it is
worth is *IS NOT GREEDY*.

As I have said, you are wrong. Greed does not stop a single one Shareware
users from paying a dime.

If the software is not worth it, then pay nothing.

If it is, send in the money.

Do not fault the author for asking for money for it, regardless of the
quality.

You are essentially saying the entire process of Shareware sucks. It doesn't.
Except for the authors. Since a hell of a lot of Shareware *IS* used by
downloaders and never paid for ...

See, there are two sides of every coin.

     Handling signals
     From: TEDJAEGER    To: ALL

Fiddling with F$Alarm and a signal handler in BASIC. Have these
things working individually but would like to combine a main
loop which houses a signal handler with a called routine where the
user can set an alarm. I also want to use the main loop to call
several other routines which leads to my question. If an alarm is
set to deliver a signal and the user has called another routine
(say a calculator) when that signal is sent then I assume the
alarm will not be caught by the signal handler which is in the
main loop. Is there a way to cue the signal sent by the alarm
so that when the user finishes with the calculator and returns
to the mainloop, the signal handler will process the signal?

Mithelen, in his reply, is correct.

I think you will find that if you use the -b modifier, to set max bits to less
than 13 (maybe 12 or 11?), it will work.  However, you can get it to work if
you patch your shell+ to not add the 8K data.  If you don't wish to modify
shell+, an alternative is to go into the stock shell with ded, or modpatch,
and change the name of it to something else, I did this, changed it to "ohell"
<G>.  I then go into a window, do an "ex ohell i=/1".  You can then call it
up and it will work fine.  I don't know of any other functions of ar2 besides
archiving a file under ar2 that won't work with the 8K-shell.  I found that
InfoXpress also won't run under 8K-shell.

If you don't like my name for shell, you can use your own, oh, yes, of course
if you use the "stock" shell you will need to rename the filename for that
shell, too.  And I would only have the shell in the file, too, and not the
other commands that were included with the original shell since they will
already be in mem with the "new" shell - you know, dir, etc..  Dunno, but it
might not be a good idea to have 2 copies of these modules in mem at once.
probably not, but no use to take chances, and it will cut down on load time
a little <G>

Look in System Modules, or Applications... Perhaps a search SHELL... You
_should_ find a submission someplace describeing the nature of the problem,
and where to patch.

The basic upshot of the problem is, shell+ insists on giveing every program
it starts 8K of memory (like tagging a #8K on every line) Some programs
writen in C, that malloc() memory, choke from this, bacause they can't
access the
memory on the stack that shell+ gives them.

Well...it depends.  Long ago I did a port of an early version of compress
(the LZW one) to OS-9/6809, and you have to remember that what that number
of bits determines is the size of the codes that correspond to strings.
12 bits implies 4096 codes, and on a 6809, if the data structure for a
code hits 16 bytes, then just the code table would eat your address space.
Each added bit of code size doubles the size of the table, of course, so
I wouldn't be surprised if you would have to do fancy footwork to manage
13-bit LZW compression on a 6809.

(I recall that 12 bits fit, but 13 wouldn't.)

  I downloaded the osk version of AR2 from here and `played' with it.
I didn't see anything in the doc file about how to set the number of
bits to use so, I used -b16.. the error message said ` 9 to 14 ' is
the range.  I don't have a coco setup so, can't say what the range is
on the 6809.. thou I would think it would be the same.

  Still, doing 14 bit on the 6809, that's real fancy footwork <g>.

The prob is solved, now.  Really, we've already gone through this "over
there"  <G>.  If you've been following the thread, I think you've already
seen where the problem is - shell+ 's always allocating 8K mem for a
process.  To get 13-bit compression, you'll need to either patch shell+ or
use a version of the "old" stock shell.

By George, it doesn't, just tried it.  I believe the OSK version does.
Oh, well, as long as we know, we can take care of that, I guess  (G).

No, I understood you.  AR uses LZW compression--that's how it manages to
shrink stuff (usually--no compression method will work on *everything*)
on its way into the archive.

Well, the whole problem would be getting to the point where everyone could
do it almost at once.  However, if we could get to one single standard,
then it would ease the process.  Really, as I said, the place to really
advance the system would be to make the 6309 standard.  I think if this could
be, then the system would make a strong advancement.

Well, anything that is any bit involved *REQUIRES* a second opinion (or
third, fourth, for that matter).  First off, you need them to catch bugs,
and these bugs will pop up no matter how careful you are.  Secondly, for
an app, you need some other ideas on implementation, and suggestions.

Yes, it's sad that these folks are not here, and quite a disadvantage.
They need to be in close contact with us.  I have Powerboost myself,
thought about Nitro, but as it is, I guess I'll migrate toward OSK, so
probably will not go to the effort.

You know, really, it might not be all that hard to have both cpu's in the
system.  It seems that all system calls would be handled in the system
modules.  Then if a 6309-specific C compiler were written, then it would
be a simple matter to double-compile it, once under each system.  Of
course the 6309 should be able to utilize any 6809 code, so it might not
be that much of a problem.

     RE: OSK Software (Re: Msg 88775)

We do have a 6309 compiler after a fashion. The asmmbler(sp) can be re-
assigned to use R63 right now. The linker shouldn't care, and as far as I
know, the preparers c_prep and ansifront do have the appropriate switches
built in now. The real hold back right now is the compiler itself, beit
the onepass or the twopass. Thats where the majority of the re-work would be
needed over and above what we now have. For .asm code, Chris's xsm, if you
know how to make it behave, works right nice.  So basicly the tools are
nearly all in place now. The only switch that I could see would be needed
in the compiler is one to switch it from B&B PB style stack images to the
Nitros9/truely native images. Actually two switches, one for use native
(new) codes, and two - use native stack.  So right there we have 4 variations
on how to do the same job and achieve the maximum efficiency on each of those
4 system variations.  Actually 3 'cause who would want the native mode stack
but not the more efficient codes?  But, like girls, its those little diffs
that make the one thats your special to you!
Yeah, I'd like to see the native mode stack in place on all 6309 machines.
How to do that, and essentially all do it at once is the 64,000,000 $ ?

Yeah, I know about that part - I'm the one who did the r63 patch, or at least
the only one I know of.   However, so far as I know, no one has yet modified
the compilers to do make the 6309 calls.  This would require a complete
rewrite of the compiler, I would think.
And the libraries.  I think BOISY was intending to do this but has now
gone to OSK.

Would it really be needed?  Not sure, but are there any direct accesses to
the stack in the libs?  Hadn't checked, but I would think all this should
be handled in the drivers, etc, shouldn't they?  I am thinking that all that
would be needed would be to have a check, probably in cstart, where you could
determine if you did indeed have a 6309, and abort if not.  Otherwise a 6809
would be trying to execute 6309 codes and missing instructions.

Phil,

I worked with it a little last year. I uploaded an OS9K version of less
which uses curses to some small degree. Hmm, wait, or was that termcap?

btw, I finally got an OS9K system back up and running in the house and
plan on taking a look at that 221 error dmode. I actually got the same
error at least once that I remember for a module which was indeed in
memory. But it was after dmode ran fine several times and it ran fine
several times after that. I will let you know what I find out.

I don't have an electronic version, so I can't help you
directly, but I can give you some pointers:

   Many PC programming books describe the ANSI emulation in some
detail.  The PC ANSI.SYS emulation is based in part on
ANSI standard X3.64, which is available in many University
libraries.  An appendix to X3.64 gives the ISO color codes
which are compatible with X3.64, but not a part of it.
The ISO equivalent to X3.64 is ISO/IEC 6429.

   There are many other terminal emulations based on these
standards, including DEC's VT-series.  V-Term's manual
includes a summary of the VT100 emulation in an appendix.
Ultimaterm's manual has a (slightly incorrect) summary
of VT100 and ANSI emulations in it's manual.

   ANSI emulation is really MSDOS-ANSI.SYS emulation.  There
are document on PC BBS an dsuch describing ANSI.SYS in some

It wasn't me having the trouble.  I was trying to diagnose someone else's
problems.  I believe it was CPERRAULT, I'm in my editor now & can't look
it up.

Anyway, he apparently wasn't getting past his init string.  I wonder if
he was sending his reset string in the init string, and then ix sending
the dial string before modem got through init'ing itself.  As an experiment
I tried this, and sure enough, I got results similar to what he described.
Ix sends a reset string before the init, so reset here is not even needed
anyway.  He never replied on this.

No, my modem does accept lowercase.  I have nothing but praise for ix,
have it for the coco and have just sent in order for OSK version.

Chris,

Did you check out my suggestion about not having the modem reset
string (ATZ if Hayes compat) in the ModemInit string?

I checked this out, and sure enough, if the reset string is sent here,
my modem will hang.  If you do have this, you will see 2 ATZ's on the
screen when you send the 'o' or 'm' cmd.  IX will do a reset before
this cmd is sent.  I think what is happening, ModemInit is sent, then
the dial string is sent immediately, and it takes a bit for my modem to
reset, and thus IMO, misses the start (maybe all) of the ATD... cmd.

 Chris (and others with modem problems),

 Be wary of using the 'atz' command with some of the newer, higher speed
 modems especially if they have fax capabilities.  The 'atz' command will
 not necessarily reset the modem to factory default, rather, it may reset
 the modem to the user profile as set by the 'at&w[n]' command.  You can
 view these settings with the 'at&v' command.  If your modem supports more
 than one user profile, you can usually select the profile by appending a
 number to the 'atz' command; i.e., 'atz0' or 'atz1'.  If you want factory
 defaults, use the command 'at&f'.  I've run into software that hardcodes
 'atz' as part of the initialization string which can cause all kinds of
 problems.  To get around this, enter your desired initialization string
 and append the string with 'at&w'.  Caveat - I don't know if the above is
 part of the 'HAYES standard' but it seems to work with modems from several
 different manufacturers.

     CD-i == Way Cool...
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

Well folks, after waiting and waiting and waiting, I went to Sears today
and picked up a brand spanking new Model 220 Philips CD-i player.
The player came with Compton's Multimedia Encyclopedia, and I bought an
extra title, "Hotel Mario."

It felt really good to go into a store and buy a supported OS-9 based
product, and see all the available software titles on the shelf for sale.
I liken the experience to buying my first CoCo (though I have to admit,
my youthful energy back in '86 afforded me much more excitement then
than it did today).

This jewel hooked up very easy to my existing stereo system (right
now it's playing an audio CD as I type this).  The picture is really
good on my television in spite of its age, and I feel like I made
a really good purchase (plus it was on sale for $20 off and I got
deferred billing for 6 mos. w/ no interest, more incentive to buy it <g>).

When I got to the store and walked up to the CD-i kiosk, I got the
surprise of my life.  There, new in the boxes, were 3 Maganvox CD-i
personal players.  Going for $299, these new CD-i machines look like
a Sega Genesis in size.  The CD is top loading (instead of front) and
can even take the FMV DV cartridge.  I assume Philips plans on taking
on the video game market with this model, since its shape and form
closely resemble that of the other popular game machiens.  It's black,
sleek looking, comes with a wired controller, and costs $200 less than the
appliance-style model; PLUS, it comes with Comptons AND Tennis.  So if you
want a nice OS-9 based game system without the fancies, you might
consider picking up this jewel (sorry, didn't get the model no.)

Now, I have to figure out how to hook it up to my MM/1....

   Boisy, congrats on your new `toy' <g>.

   One thing I keep meaning to get is the `S-Video' cable, just
to see what kind of picture that will get me.. part# VCA1135,
list $15.98.. fits the 910 and 220 only.

   You'll want to keep your serial number handy, if/when you need
help with any games, call 800 845 7301 for `hints' <g>.  Also, you
can call and ask for a price sheet of all the goodies.

   Good info.  First I heard of these models.  And speaking of FMV DV
cart's, that is the next `must have' item you'll want, only if your
interested in the `movies' <g>.  And, the movies are great.  I just
got Addams Family Values and it's better than VHS tape!  Crystal
clear pictures.. Yes.

> Now, I have to figure out how to hook it up to my MM/1....

   Check out the data base here, Frank Hogg, and I have uploaded
some info on the `box'.  Enjoy.

Well...while on my way to a rehearsal Saturday, I stopped at Best Buy.
They've finally gotten in some new discs--a fair number of Video CD
movies, which I'll have to wait a bit on, but also some new games.
I got *Inca* and *Kether*.  *Kether* has received good reviews in
the game magazines, and *Inca* is pretty slick, too.  Now, if I can
just I avoid getting myself blasted out of the sky almost immediately...
<sigh>

I do have to admit that *Kether*'s 3D segments are a lot more
impressive on a BIG screen TV.  When I saw it a while back at a
Rex store on a 36" or so TV, dodging those meteors induced a
considerable physical reaction.
