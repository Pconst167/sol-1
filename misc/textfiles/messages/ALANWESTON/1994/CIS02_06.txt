Hi stranger....

>my get/put routines are all word-oriented (16-bits at a time)...

In that case, it might be faster for Eric to use get/puts for his screen
updates; instead of the memmove() stuff he is doing right now.

When I browsed thought the Signetics manuals I thought that pixac would permit
faster bit manipulation stuff, etc. But, I remember you telling us that this is
not a true hardware pixac...

We do it, but I can't think of much in the line of caveats.  It is big.
You don't need it all.  You can't change address conveniently.  Save my
PPN and mail me if you have trouble.  I can probably help.

Kevin:

Hi, What version is windio at? As soon a Mark get my I/O Board back to me
(Upgrade to 9 Meg.) and sends me the 68340 CPU then I will get the Hard Drive
back up and running. I also have /t3 and /t4. Would like to either get another
hard drive and or a tape backup.  Where can I get the newest version of windio?

Thanks.

P.S. Is anyone working on a CD-ROM driver and descriptor for the MM/1? also a
fax send/receive program.
