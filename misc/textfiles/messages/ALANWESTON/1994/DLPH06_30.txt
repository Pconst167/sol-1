I don't believe this is the problem since the errors are steadily
growing, and never decreasing, over time.  And my Maxtor 120MB drive
seems fully powered up by the time my floppy is finished loading
OS9Boot.

That would be great.  I have a similar situation as you with my hard
drive being backed up.  It would take quite a while to rebuild.  :(

   Joel, just wondering something.. do you have some files `linked'
to more than one directory ?  Just a thought...  I don't `think'
that dcheck likes finding files with more than one link to them.

Ya, I probably should use dcheck more often. But on my coco I had several
features that caused dcheck to barf; multi-linked files and such. Due to the
constant complaints dcheck gave there, I never got into the habit.

Yep, a file linker does exist. I found it either here or CIS. While it works
as advertised, the rest of os9 doesn't get along with it very well. For one,
dcheck barfs on linked files. for another, if something moves the file
descriptor, then the whole link tree is broken. For example, I had a ds.init
file that was linked into various different directories. One day I edited this
file with DS. DS edits by writing a new file, then destroying the old one. This
of course left all the links point at now "empty disk". Nasty.


  If you *really* want it, and can't find it, I'll email to ya.

Nope, I have never used that "link" program or library to create links
as they really don't work under OS-9.  I'll have to do some testing.
The only thing I can think of is get a listing of all the "sectors not
in allocation table" (which right now is very large) and then try a few
commands, run dcheck again to another output file and use 'cmp' to check
if anything has changed, and then go on.  I guess cmp would not really
work, since things like free memory on the disk will change with some
utilities and that would be flagged using cmp.  But if it shows actual
line changes, then I can watch only for changes in the list of "sectors
not in alloc. table" messages.  That shall prove tedious, I bet... ;)

Thanks Randy, I did a little digging in the DB's here and found one..
I would have DLed it before, but, the link command is an option for "cp"
a copy command.. since the standard Mware copy always worked fine for me
.I never bothered looking at CP :).. anyway, thanks..

  That or just doing a lot of `dir -e' after each use to see if the files
get larger (yuk)..  Looks like you've got a lot of work to do...

  Let us know what you find out.

If you *really* want to have fun, try writing something that folks
running OS-9000 on their 80x86s, where the byte ordering is backwards
<grin>, can use.  People who really have to do that typically wind up
either writing stuff out in ASCII or picking one byte ordering to use,
so processors with a different byte ordering have to notice and switch
everything around.  (GIF is an example of the latter choice.)

It is--but I believe that the ANSI standard phrases things in such a way
that the docs for a conforming compiler have to say how it works.

 > Do you have to take this odd-mem thing into consideration if you are

Yes, you do have to take it into consideration in assembly language.

we do about the inner workings of our respective operating systems.  I'm

still search for the same range of tools and utilities for the PC that I'm

I'm just sorry my budget won't let me migrate to a 68K machine for the

adq and lha keep popping up (I've got InfoXpress on order), my Coco will
remain a useful tool.  That multitasking is just too addicting!

You may also want to try downloading to a ramdisk (if you don't have a hard

extracted properly, and check to make sure they both have the "e" attiubute

This one is very convenient because it does not require the user to iniz it

What do you have in mind? I carry the Ken-Ton controllers for SCSI drives.
There are some complete, ready to run 85MB units for $550.00, or I can put
together a "no disk" package for $235, which includes everything BUT the
drive, case, and power supply. The controller alone is $135.00, plus $30
for the DECB drivers, $25 for the OS-9 drivers ($50 is both bought together).
Cables are pretty easy to get, but I can supply them also. The $235 kit
comes with a y-cable and SCSI cable, as well as burning in the ROM.
This is a true SCSI controller, and will run up to seven devices.

     Mucked up CM-8
     From: ILLUSIONIST  To: ALL

I recently picked up a CM-8 dirt cheap ($20) from a local CoCoer that
was dis-satisfied with it because it has a slight (and do mean slight)
discoloration on the screen due to (probably) exposure to a magnetic
field.. it isnt very bad, only shows up when reddish/orangish colors
are on the screen.. and even then sometimes I have to look real hard to
see it, anyway, I was just curious, is there anyway to easily get this
CM-8 back to "normal", or can I expect it to fad with time, since it
is so slight??? thanks in advance..

Mike,
   If the colors are fouled up by stray magnetic fields, the effect
SHOULD go away by itself in time.  There is a degaussing circuit that
operates for a quick instant each time the monitor is turned on.
Sometimes, when the effect is strong, it takes several cycles to
"erase" the stray magnetic fields.

Note: I am basing this advice on my experience as a TV repairman,
back in the days when many sets still had TUBES in them.  (TUBES:
glass things --  light up and get hot).

If you are in a hurry, or the degaussing circuit is dead, you can
borrow a "degaussing coil" from a TV Repairman.  ANYTHING that
puts out a strong AC magnetic field will work - I did a pretty decent
job once with a weller 100 watt soldering gun.

Whatever the source of your degaussing field, the procedure is the
same.  Turn it on, get it real close the the face of the screen -
keeping it moving all the time.  I usually move in circles over the
screen, and then back up (still moving it around) until the effect
from the degaussing coil fades from the screen, then turn it off.
Repeat as necessary.

If two or three trys don't do it - you have another problem which
may require adjustment to some little coils and magnets on or near
the neck of the tube.  Tricky stuff. Serious potential for nasty
surprises.  Get someone who has done it before.

     Latest in Basic problems
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

        Well here's yet another update of how far a haven't gotten with
   my program. Gene(wdtv5) mentioned stripping the high bit on the last
   byte and terminating the string with an $FF marker. Well I THINK I
   stripped the bit, if stripping means lowering the bit value to where
   it should be, at -128. I did it with the following statement:

        name:=name+CHR$(Land(fname.filename(count),$7F))

        And then I add the following statement after it:

        Name:=name+chr$($FF)

        Which I was hoping would mark the end of string properly. I have
   still gotten no change in behavior from the program tho :-( I have
   tried quite a few other methods I can't remember<the reason it has
   taken me so long to get back>, but they either produced the same
   results or more disasterous results, such as only printing only the
   last character in the filename, because of the way I did certain
   statements. Certainly not completely DISASTEROUS but those results
   only took me further off track. I'm assuming the reason I'm getting no
   difference from the program is because I am applying the end of string
   marker wrong. Maybe Name:=name+chr$($FF) is completely wrong?
   Unfortunately this is the only way I can think of for doing it. Does
   anyone know another way, and also, does anyone know where I might be
   able to find some source code that does a job similar to what I am
   doing? I can't seem to find much in the way of Basic source here on
   Delphi.

If you want Basic source for reading in a filename..take a look ar
err, take a look at the source for IndiPWB..I read in filenames a few
times in that code.. if ya DL it and cant find where I am talking about
(the code is kinda big by Basic09 standards) I will give you the PROCEDURE
name and line number where the routine starts.. high bit stripping
is done automatically in there..

 Since 'Name' isn't properly terminated yet there is no way for Basic09 to
 know where to put the $FF terminator.

 >Does anyone know another way, and also, does anyone know where I might be
 >able to find some source code that does a job similar to what I am doing? I

 What you need to do is examine each character in the filename for high bit
 set.  I havn't used Basic09 in a loooooong time but here a brief outline of
 the process:

 filename ---> original name
 name ---> name with $FF terminator
 khar ---> characer under consideration
 n ---> counter into character array
 & ---> logical and
 ^ ---> logical exclusive or
 != ---> not equal to

 n = 0                          :start at the beginning
 if(filename[0] != 0)           :if not already a deleted entry
    loop                        :do this until told otherwise
        khar = filename[n]      :get a character
        if((khar & $40) != 0)   :if high bit set
            khar ^ $40          :clear the bit
            name[n] = khar      :move modified char to name
            n=n+1               :increment counter
            name[n]=$FF         :terminate
            exitloop            :exit the loop
        endif
        name[n]=khar            :move char to name
        n=n+1                   :loop back and get next character
    endloop
 else
    :handle deleted entry
 endif

 I usually do this in assembler after copying the entire entry including the
 segment pointer to a buffer:

 * MAKE a dir entry 4(for) C - put in a NULL terminator so C is happy
 * pointer to entry in d0
 make4c:
     movem.l a0,-(sp)        save affected register
     movea.l d0,a0           move name pointer to a0
 * first check if it's a deleted entry
     tst.b   (a0)            is this a deleted entry?
     beq.s   mak4exit        already NULL terminated
 mak4loop
     move.b  (a0),d0         move a byte to d0
     btst.l  #7,d0           test for high bit set
     bne.s   mak4done        branch if set
     addq.l  #1,a0           increment pointer
     bra.s   mak4loop        loop back
 mak4done
     bclr.b  #7,(a0)+        clear the bit and increment pointer
     clr.b   (a0)            NULL terminate
 mak4exit
     movem.l (sp)+,a0        restore a0
     rts

 Hope this helps

The $ff terminator is how BASIC09 terminates strings (when they're
shorter than their declared length), so you shouldn't have to worry
about that.  I take it you're reading a directory?  If you are, then
you have two things to worry about:

1. Skipping entries that correspond to deleted files
2. Converting end-of-string conventions.

You're working on (2), but you may be getting hit by (1).  Oops...
come to think of it, there's a possible third thing, namely the
question of what you should do with the entries for "." and "..".
That depends on your application, and since I don't know what
that is, I can't speak to that.

Hmmm...how are you getting the initial portion of the name?  You're
liable to have to do something like

 name:=""
 FOR count:=1 TO 28
    EXITIF LAND(fname.filename(count),$80)<>0 THEN
       name:=name+CHR$(LAND(fname.filename(count),$7F))
    ENDEXIT
    name:=name+CHR$(fname.filename(count))
 NEXT count

As for empty entries, I believe that you'll find that their first
characters are overwritten with $00, but that's worth checking out
to be sure.

     OS-9 Books
     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL

        Can anyone tell me if the book 'Inside OS-9 Level II' is still
   available, and if so where can I find it? I remember hearing that it
   was long out of print but a while back, read that it was either still
   in print or a vendor still had copies available. Through the passage
   of time, I can't remember what is what anymore<G>. I'd like to get
   more reading material on Level II, and OS-9 in general, and I can't
   seem to get much more out of 'The Basic09 Tour Guide' or the 'Guide to
   Windows'. Also, are there any other books available that explore Level
   II a bit more in depth than the previously mentioned ones? As you can
   judge from questions I tend to ask here a lot, I am looking for
   further explanations of features not covered enough in the Tandy
   released material.
        Since I'm on the subject let's see how many books are available
   that cover OS-9 in all of it's forms. As far as I know, we have:

        OS-9 Insights(Does this have a LII counterpart?)
        The OS-9 Guru
        Inside OS-9 Level II(does this have an OSK counterpart?)
        Tandy's Little Wonder(Not OS-9 Specific, but close enough)

        I have heard of others I think. Is there more we can add to the
   list? I'm keeping in mind books that are not specifically aimed at
   industrial users<if there are any>,but ones that cover the system in
   general and can be used by personal users, such as the above. I'm
   curious what count we are up to now.
        Btw, a little off topic, but when is the next MOTD due out? I
   just renewed my subscription to the UG finally<about 2 weeks ago
   actually>, so it has been a while since I've heard anything new from
   the UG.

You need  to close the file first.  Try to open another capture buffer
and if one  is all  ready open SC will ask if you want to close it.
Type y and then you can do what ever you  would  like with the file.
