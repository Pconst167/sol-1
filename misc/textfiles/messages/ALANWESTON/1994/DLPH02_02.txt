        I agree, it really is shaping up in content. It was mentioned in
   there that the newsletter itself wasn't that good as of late<not the
   content but the  makeup and layout itself>. I think it's fine, and as
   a member don't think they should concentrate too much on how the MOTD
   comes out so long as it is decent<personally I like it as it is now>
   and not try and make it too flashy. From what I read, it seems they
   are taking this route, and taking care of more important matters,
   rather than worrying about producing another magazine :-) so that's
   good. Maybe later when the resources are available, we can have it
   spiffed up a bit.
        I was starting to worry for a bit, because I wasn't hearing much
   of the UG here for a couple weeks or so, and then the latest MOTD
   showed up, and it looks like EVERYONE is serious about making this
   work. I hope everyone in the membership gets involved, even if it is
   little things that they do. I plan on at least putting in my 2 cents
   tho if possible, I'd rather give $1.50 :-)
        Also, I'm glad they are making the account balances open, as I
   have a big interest in how it stands financially, because I may have
   some idea on how to bring money into the UG or at least ideas for
   current methods, and questions, on what we can do legally to bring it
   in.

It occurs to me that because gnuchess uses register variables and that
while gnuchess talked to your serial terminal, yet not to your MM/1 console
device, that your MM/1 console driver, windows, or whatever is stepping on
a variable.  I've recompiled gnuchess without register variables (it's about
4K longer that way) and will upload it or mail it if you want to try it.

I don't think, by design of OS9, that KWin is stepping on the program
registers or variable space. A more likely cause would be gnuchess spazzing
out on what it found (or didn't find) in the vsc termcap entry. Is there
a way to get a list of what the program expects, termcap-wise?

     9600bps connection
     From: KEITHBAUER   To: ALL

Ever so slowly I am getting things going with the Zoom 14.4 modem. I am now
able to connect to Delphi at 9600 via Osterm/68k but for some reason I can
not connect using IX. I have it setup as direct. At first it seems that IX
was not waiting long enough for the modem to decide on the speed that it was
connecting at. I added F8 and N0 to the init string and that seemed to solve
the problem. I then was able to connect without IX breaking the connection.
IX then sends out the "C DELPHI" string but it sends it out before delphi
asks for it.

I am on an MM/1 using port T4. I have the jumpers set as DTE and RTS/DTR
Tied High. I am able to upload & download from Delphi, CIS, and my local
BBS at high speeds. My only problem left is connecting with IX.

Any ideas?

Keith, my Zoom works fine on /t3, as it came out of the box. First, restrap
the paddle board. Either set both RTS and DTR to toggled, or *remove* the
jumpers entirely, which while force the two low. The jumpers are on the TTL
side of things, so true=low. Your modem is not going to like seeing DTR and RTS
false.

 Then set your port speed to 19200, and hardware handshake on (type=80). Reset
the modem to factory defaults, and give it a try. You may want to try it
with Terminal v1.0 (shareware version). I do know that this program does the
controls right. I can not vouch for OSTerm, having never seen it in action.

  Once you have the mm/1 and modem working together as intended, not three
quarters brain-dead, then we can see what it takes to get ix working, on the
off chance it still complains.

   This number has a human at the other end, just ask for a 9600 local

  I am using a MM/1 with a USR 14.4/14.4FAX Sporter external modem. I have
no trouble with using either 9600 here on Delphi or 14.4 on a local BBS.
I am using the default settings.
  BTW I am upgrading, for Blackhawk, the old Terminal 1.0 to a newer
version called KTerm. Right now it is at Beta 2.0. Using it right now.
When David brings it out, I think you will be impressed on the upgrade.

It now has 38K baud for one thing.

Joel,
   I guess I'm not sure what those MOD files are. Are they just a different
format sampleing file, like IFF, VOC, WAV and so on ? So in order to have
1 minute of sound, sampled at 10k, it would take 600k of memory or 1.2m for
stereo. But I think that those MIDI only contain information needed to
build the needed waveforms. In other words, they would tell an external
generator, give me a 1000 cycle tone for 1 minute. This is very very simple
example, but the difference in data storage would be tremendous.

Larry,

    MOD files are small sound files made from "instruments" (short sampled
waveforms or sounds) at a base frequency.  Then, the rest of the MOD file is
just the "arrangement" of those sounds, plus volume change info, and pitch
change info.  So, there may be a violin "instrument" sound sample, and then
the frequency is just varied to create different notes for the song.  This is
why MOD files are so much smaller than fully sampled files!  (And also why
they require so much CPU time, with all the pitch and volume changing on the
fly!)  So, this would be very much what a MIDI player would have to do as well.

Well...you shouldn't let not having Bison (or byacc, which I use to keep what
I do from being contaminated with GPL) and flex keep you from doing a compiler.

Heck, pcc didn't use lex for its lexical scanner, and since Ritchie's C
compiler predates yacc, it certainly wasn't written using yacc.  Recursive
descent, with operator precedence for the expressions, should do the job.

The important part is what you do once you've finished parsing.
