  I was somewhat surprised to see a thread on this subject here in the OS-9
forum.  About 6 weeks (or more) ago when I first learned of PGP, I logged
into a local BBS here in San Diego and D/Led my own personal copy of it.  I
have never liked the idea of censorship for the masses, and that is exactly
what this "Wonderful Government" of ours has in mind to do.  They say it is
for the "Greater Good" that they want to catch the criminal and cut down on
crime!  What I do not see is how "spying" on the GOOD is going to catch the
bad!  After looking at this program and reading about it, I really cannot
see                      how...  Please disregard this last statement.  My posit
ronics wandered
                                a bit or 2 and had no relevance to this message.
  I must go, more messages
to read.  Have not been out here for more than a year, so you can imagine
the large number to be read.  LONG LIVE OS-9! <FOREVER>

The clipper chip doesn't make it any easier for the government to "spy" on
individuals. It does give the gov't the key to decrypt messages when needed.
A warratn is still required for a phone tap or even to get into a large system
e-mail. They do want to make SURE they can decrypt any messages IF getting
into a system is NECESSARY. The is ALL the clipper is good for. At the same
time,
it is a standardized encryption method that makes it harder for the average
person
to read your e-mail or otherwise intercept anything you send. Also makes it
harder for real spys to get info by simply calling up and d'l ing whatever they
want through internet. People seem to have the idea that someone actually WANTS
to periodically read
 everything they send just for grins. There are some legitimate reasons for a
general purpose encryption system. The gov't wants the key so they can get into
mail files WHEN NECESSARY for prosecuting criminals. In case you haven't heard,
the really good dr
ug dealers and such now use e-mail, cellular phones, and everything else they
can afford (and they have plenty money!) to make their "business" more
profitable and efficient. When the gov't takes to making random samplings of
system E-mail and reading it t
hen I'll raise hell! But this isn't worth the fuss being raised! I do, however,
believe that the export of nearly all encryption software... banning export, I
mean... is going a bit to far. Are americans the only really great programmers
out there who can
turn out unbreakable encryption schemes? I don't think so....

As E.E. "Doc" Smith wrote in a different context, "But what an 'all'!"

Given the history of folks like J. Edgar Hoover, or the late President
Nixon's "enemies list," do you really think that the government will
need much excuse to claim that it's "necessary" to read encrypted messages?
Just the past week or so, President Clinton has said that gee, the Fourth
Amendment's provision prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure isn't
all that important compared to the possibility of catching criminals
in random searches without warrant in Chicago government-subsidized
housing projects.

 There is a subtle difference between "liberty" and "license".  Liberty is a
 freedom that you are endowed with and no man has the right to trespass on
 it.  License is a conditional freedom granted by someone with the power to
 regulate who may or may not have it.  To be deprived of your liberty the
 state must prove that you have committed specific offenses against other
 individuals.  To _gain_ a license you must prove that you meet certain
 qualifications.  Even then you can be denied.

 A very fundamental difference between the two is where the burden of proof
 lies.  A 'liberty' exists until proven otherwise.  A 'license' must be
 petitioned from the state.

 From The Office of the Press Secretary, April 16, 1993:

    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring the
    Federal Government together with industry in a VOLUNTARY PROGRAM to
    improve the security and privacy of telephone communications while
    meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement. [Emphasis Added]

 To be effective, the clipper chip must be the _only_ encryption available to
 the public.  All other expressions of the technology must be forbidden to
 the people who are to be monitored.  The contention that it is to be
 "voluntary" is obfuscation to hide the intent of controlling encryption
 technology by license.

 From later in the same memo:

    A "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the "Clipper
    Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Each
    device containing the chip will have two unique "keys," numbers that will
    be needed by authorized government agencies to decode messages encoded by
    the device.  When the device is manufactured, the two keys will be
    deposited separately in two "key-escrow" data bases that will be
    established by the Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be
    limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
    wiretap.

 The privacy of your communications and data will no longer be under your
 control.  It will be granted or denied on the basis of decisions made by the
 faceless bean counters who control the data base where the keys are stored.
 A fundamental freedom to be secure in your "...persons, houses, papers and
 effects..." will have been converted into a privilege.

 Human rights issues aside, you point to one of the fundamental flaws in the
 clipper chip scheme:  The huge amounts of money that certain groups can
 bring to bear to subvert it.  Do you REALLY feel more secure knowing that
 your private communications and data will be open to anyone with he money
 to buy the key to your chip?  If you doubt that this will happen, ask
 yourself how speculators and con men alway seem to get the unlisted phone
 numbers of lottery winners.

 >They do want to make SURE they can decrypt any messages IF getting into a
 >system is NECESSARY.

 I'm sure they do.  But a citizen's definition of "necessary" might be a
 little different from a government's definition.

 Remember the case of Steve Jackson Games?  In 1990 the Secret Service raided
 the company's offices looking for evidence of a hacker conspiracy.  In
 addition to three computers and a laser printer they confiscated every copy
 of the GURPS Cyberpunk manual calling it "a handbook for computer crime".

 Pretty damned thin (GURPS Cyberpunk is a _GAME_ for Crissakes!) but the
 Secret Service was able to find a sympathetic judge who gave them a
 warrant anyway.

 The Secret Service later admitted that Steve Jackson Games wasn't a target of
 the investigation.  They just _suspected_ that they _might_ find some
 evidence on the computers, so in they came!

 Why do we need some "standardized encryption method" anyway?  I, frankly,
 get a little tired of those people who want to have standards for every
 little thing.  If Apple had listened to the "standards" at the time they
 would have never created the Macintosh.  If Kaplan, Crane and Dogget had
 paid attention to the 'standards' they wouldn't have written OS9.

 Cliff Stoll once pointed out that if the standards freaks had their way
 every computer on the Internet would be like every other computer on the
 Internet and the internet worm would have brought done all 60,000 instead of
 about 10% of that.

 >Also makes it harder for real spys to get info by simply calling up and
 >d'l ing whatever they want through internet.

 Which is going to be harder to steal, information encrypted with an unknown
 algorithm or information that can be read by anyone with the money or
 influence to get the necessary keys from the government computers?  Betcha
 dollars to donuts that DOD doesn't use clipper to encrypt it's secret
 communication.  Any takers?

 >When the gov't takes to making random samplings of system E-mail and reading
 >it t hen I'll raise hell! But this isn't worth the fuss being raised!

 Sorry, but the only way to stop the government poking into and controlling
 your affairs is to deny them the power to do so.  Everything the government
 claims about the clipper chip now sounds good and noble.  Lenin and Trotsky
 sounded pretty noble as they established the bureaucratic infrastructure
 for Stalin.  Mussolini had good intentions too - I think we all know what's
 paved with those...

 >I do, however, believe that the export of nearly all encryption software...

 I'll certainly agree there.

 That mere fact the government is prohibiting the export of software that
 incorporates encryption technology should raise a few warning flags.  None
 of the algorithms on the restricted list is secret and few are proprietary.
 They have all been published in various journals so why does our government
 feel the need to restrict their export?  The only explanation I find makes
 sense is that it's an expression of the anal retentive nature of governments
 to want to control everything!

 All opinions expressed herein are mine but you can distribute them if you

     as_h6309.zip
     From: WDTV5        To: ALL

I've got a new question for somebody. Anybody even.
I ftp'd over to chestnut a week or so back and picked up what looked like an
interesting file, as_h6309.zip. It purports to be an assembler for the
6809/6309 family of cpu's, with the 6309 stuffs being switchable for '809
only uses.
It 'unzip'ed without errors leaving me with 2 doc/man files and a .exe file
that is not an os9 file. On inspection with dump, it has a string containing
the words PKLITE in the first sector.  I've tried to further un-archive this
file to no avail. Am I going to have to carry it to a pc that has PKLITE on
it to unpack it any farther, or is there a so called PKLITE convertor
available for os9?

Frankly it doesn't look too badly compressed, some of the other strings in
it almost survived!

Any help will be gratefully appreciated.  Cheers all, Gene Heskett

Is it a cross asm. for the PC -> 6x09's ? As for the .EXE, that is probably
a self-extracting file, just run in on a PC, and it will extract..will you
actually be able to use this program though? I mean, if it is a PC .exe,
it will do the CoCo no good.. I have a cross asm for PC > 6809 around here
somewhere, I never use it though.. I have an XT sitting here with no
monitor or keyboard though, I am toying with the idea of hooking it up
to the coco, run the coco as a terminal to the XT and have the XT fork
command.com with stdin and stdout to the serial port (yes that actually
can be done under DOS, its just that that is the only process that runs)
most DOS apps wont run though (alot of DOS programs do direct screen
writes, those that dont use ANSI codes, THAT might work, but our color
set and all would make it messy..) but for the apps that I would actually
run on an XT it will work ok (I would probably put a few command-line
oriented compilers on the DOS box and definatly put that cross asm.)

If I do it, it will be more of a "well, why not?" type thing, the XT is
sitting around, and I have an un-used serial port... actually, 2
unused serial ports, on the coco...besides, an XT as a slave subsystem
is a nice idea.. :)

I rather suspect thats exactly what it is Mike. I grabbed it thinking the
germans had managed to come up with a new, more capable version of our rma.
The docs don't mention its a bunch of INTEL code though, no place, no how.
What the docs do say is that it could be a better rma than rma, and that
it does the usual optimizations while its translating your source. Could
the fact that the standard comment marker is a semicolon confirm its
heritage?

No, not being a member of the Atari forum should have had no effect
like that. The only two times I have run across that message has
either been when (a) I spelled the group name wrong  or (b) the group
actually was not available [which happened with one of the amiga groups
I used to read].

According to the list of Usenet groups I have (the Apple section's
Usenet reader has an option to fetch the current list), it is listed
as:

comp.os.os9             Discussions about the os9 operating system.

So it appears you got the spelling correct.

FTR, I tried going into to the Atari reader and using "comp.os.os9",
and had no problem (54 messages in the past 14 days, BTW).

BTW, once you do successfully access comp.os.os9, you can SAVE it to
your personal favorites, and when you select that item from any of the
Usenet readers, it will be listed by number, so that you will not have
to worry about possibly mistyping it. As I recall, you do this by
typing "SAVE" anytime you are actually in the newsgroup. (It has been
a while since I set my favorites up, so anyone feel free to correct me
if I am wrong).

Does OSK RZ 3.24 support crash recovery?  If yes, how does it
work with Delphi's zmodem?

Yes, RZ/SZ 3.24 suppors crash recovery, No, you can not use crash recovery
with Delphi's Zmodem... At least not for downloads, not sure on uploads.
(I doubt it) I'm almost 100% sure Delphi uses a version of Zmodem that was
before crash recovery came into existance...

Can anyone tell me if there is a way to assemble a C programming environment
using the Level II RMA? I assume there has to be, I'm just not proficient
enough or knowledgable enough to figure it out <G>.

If all things remain the same, I'll be making a trip out there soon. I'll
have to hunt for your address again. If I don't find it I'll give you a buzz.

I'll be starting a game by mail with one of my co-workers. He's a good
player, but I7ve beaten him one or twice.

Don't feel bad about OS-9. We have all been beginners at one time or another.
And, some of us ( me encluding) will always be.  May next adventure will be
into C. The worst part being there is a wealth of information (patches, modules
changes, etc) to wade through. Picking the right combination will be the real
challenge.

Talk to you.

Thanks Randy. It worked like a charm. I have back my old system again. I
guess I didn't have the meta characters set in my previous use of shell+.
