Hi,

There are two forums which discuss CD-i and VOD on CIS (acronym overload :)

One is the Video Games Forum, Section 6.  This section is devoted to
CD-i from a user's point of view.

The other is the Multimedia Forum, Section 17, where CD-i is discussed
in a technical fashion.  I read both since my interests lie in the
technical and user ends.

Good luck.

Sb: DAT drive descriptor 
Fm: CHRISTOPH STUMMER 100067,1570
To: all

Hallo all,

we are a multimedia developer working with Philips CD-I.
We are using a CD-I 605 player with CD-RTOS and want to install a HP 35480A
SCSI DAT Drive for backup. The problem is that the descriptors for exabyte and
viperdrives do not work.
So my question is, wether anybody has written such a descriptor or knows a
source who can provide one.
I hope somebody can help me with that,


Christoph.

I have the source.  I saw where this was done.  If you missed my original post,
I had not nulled out my echo.. I had not realized that it worked the way it
does.

Yeah, I see that now.  I didn't realize that was the way it worked.

Yep, that was the way it was going <G>

I had mine exit on "NO DIAL TONE". I set up a config file, to look for each
BBS, with a # of attempts to try.. I let it be infinite if this # wass
negative.  It would keep trying as long as it saw "BUSY" or "NO CARRIER". Yes,
and if "NO ANSWER", it would set the count to 1 and try once more, then exit.

 > like a switch() statement in C does...maybe you want a project?

It might be a good idea.. Do we have a need for a fairly elaborate external
autodialer?  I had thought of developing mine to a pretty neat thing, but, if
you have already done it, there would be no need.

Ummm, about the switch() thing.. I can't think of anything to do except keep
dialing on "nonfatal" responses or exit on "fatal" ones.

To follow up on my previous post concerning the CoCo3 emulator (that will run
OS9 LII), the latest version of the CoCo2 emulator (which will run OS9 LI and
includes information on ordering the CoCo3 emulator) has been uploaded to the

Fm: Ben Williams 74774,3106
To: All

I've got a 6809 emulation 100% up and running on my Amiga. I have it booting to
Flex (TSC's old OS). Works fine, and gave me access to all my old 6809 source
code, which is very nice.

Now, I'd like to get OS9 for the 6809 up and running on it. I have an old
version fo the CoCo, but frankly it never worked very well - I probably have
too early a copy (like, the day it first appeared in stores). Further, at least
at this point, I don't much want to extend the emulator to "be" a CoCo. Lots of
work there to make it work right, and the current emulation is very efficient
and fast - it wouldn't be so nice with all that specialized hardware emulation
built in, I'm sure.

So again, the system looks like a 64k 6809. I have Psymon as a boot monitor,
and can extend it or replace it, either way - assuming I have something to
replace it WITH, of course. :-)

Any suggestions?

Thanks for any replies,

PowerBasic is the only native (68000) code BASIC compiler for use with
the OS-9/68000 Operating System.

------

I've just uploaded information on PowerBasic to DL12. Two files, one
gives the promo information and the other covers a introductory offer
that saves you $50 if ordered by the end of the month. Over the next
several days I will be uploading a more complete technical spec and
examples in PowerBasic source and object that you can try on your own
computer. I've downloaded a whole bunch of Basic09 programs from the DL
here and I plan to use some of them as examples also. My intent is to
see and show what is involved in converting regular Basic09 type
programs to PowerBasic and what speed and size advantages there are. If
you have any other suggestions you would like to see me try please let
me know.

I got my copy of PowerBasic just before Thanksgiving and have been
getting up to speed on it. So far I like it very much. The compiler runs
fast and the resultant code generated is also fast. Much much faster
than Basic09. I've been having fun looking at the '.a' files to see what
assembler code is generated by PowerBasic and to watch how changes in
the Basic program effect the assembler code. PowerBasic makes this easy
because the Basic source line is inserted into the '.a' file as a
comment.

PowerBasic object is stand alone, no 'runb' type of thing is needed. I
like this because it keeps the whole project as one program. No need to
worry about having all the pieces needed to make something work.

I'm looking for feedback so please feel free to ask questions and make
suggestions.

Thanks
