In OSK, I do such things in startup. As an example:

 (profile /dd/sys/.logins/altos3; shell &) <>>>/t0
 (profile /dd/sys/.logins/vt102; shell &)  <>>>/t3
 profile /dd/sys/.logins/kwin
 shell <>>>/w&
 shell <>>>/w&
 shell <>>>/w&

Do not TRASH the CoCo 3!!! Doing so is like cutting off your legs 'cause
someone says BIONICS is better!

Sir:

  I believe you may have misunderstood my request for info on Shell+.  I
have Shellplus V2.2a,  what I need is to find Shellplus V2.2 which is
supposed to be a '92-'93 version Of Shell+.  I need the documentation
for Shellplus V2.2, not V2.2a.  Thank you for you quick reply.  I hope
that you may have the correct answer to my quest.  See ya!
