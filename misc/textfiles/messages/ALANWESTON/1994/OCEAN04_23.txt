James:
I appended my dial.sys file with your setup:
.
Ocean Beach (14.4K);16192244878;DT*70,;38400;8N1;YES
Delphi (2400);2886206;DT*70,;38400;8N1;YES
ACS Inc. BBS;14046362991;DT*70,;38400;8N1;YES
.
If I dial one of the numbers "as is", I get a dial off to
oblivion with no connect, but then again I don't get NO DIALTONE.
Here locally GTE uses 70# to disable call waiting, so I
substituted *70 with 70#.  When I dial I get a busy signal right
after the 70#, and the rest of the number is dialed over the busy
signal (obviously to no avail).  This happens because I don't have
call waiting.  So I deleted the call waiting disable and left the
pause comma -- dialing proceeded normally with a successful connect.
Humm...
.
As far as setting the port to 38.4k, this definitely doesn't impact
on dialing, i.e. a connect should occur even if at the wrong speed.
.
At this point I recommend that you remove the call wait disable
to see what happens.
Some other questions:
- Which port are you using?
- Do you xmode the port at any time?
- Can you show me an ident of the port?
More importantly:
- Can you dial successfully and with the same strings (as in
dial.sys) from within LaTerm?
- Do the same strings work in other dialers?
.
I hope we can resolve this problem and find a simple if
not elegant solution.
I hope this helps,
Alan

I finally found my Mail problem,  The uucpbb.doc did not mention that a
dir is needed as follows '/dd/usr/MAIL'. In that is located the various
users dir ie; /dd/usr/mail/warren, /dd/usr/mail/postmaster etc etc.
Thanks to Bob Billson's quick reply. Now to get the rest of things in
order and I should be online soon.

I was amazed myself.  I sort of remember installing something by Bob va
der Poel which supposedly patched the clock module to automagically
change for daylight savings.
