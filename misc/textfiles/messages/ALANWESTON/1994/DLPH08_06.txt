Does anyone know if there are any books available for "curses"? The package
comes with OS9000 and is taken from Unix. <Phil>

You should be able to find something at any respectable book store... Look

There are books (or at least one) available.  I picked up one at a local Barnes
& Noble called Unix Curses (I belive - of course I can't find the darn book
right now, probably buried in my UNIX stuff).  It wasn't cheap.  If I locate it
within a reasonable amount of time, I'll send you the name and author.  BTW,
it also explained termcap as an introduction to curses. I guess I gotta clean
this place up. (grin)

The best books on any UNIX topic are from O'Reilly & Associates, Inc (IMHO).
I have several of their books. I do not have the Curses book, but I'm sure that
it will be every bit as authoritative as the others. The book is called
Programming with Curses. It's $12.95. Call in US 1-800-998-9938.

Thanks Dennis, but you can get that by typing "modpatch -?". Doesn't help
a guy like me who has no idea what he's doing!! I did (apparently) get it

Frank,

I thought I mentioned it, but maybe I did not.  Here are the steps for
changing diskette access time:

modpatch
l d0
(that's L d0, not 1 d0)

c c 14 00 03
v
(exit with CTRL/BREAK, [that's control and break TOGETHER which is the eof

Good Luck.

  Just a quick idea re: an 'official online home'. Would it be possible to
work out a deal with Delphi (similar to Rainbows) where OS9UG members could
join for free and maybe get a little better deal on connect time? Maybe like
5 hours for $12 instead of 4 for $10? Would get more people to the 'official
online home' and add another perk to the membership. (Are you listening, Paul
J ??)

   BTW, would you like a demo copy of GCDP the G-window audio CD Player??
I've got the window refreshing itself and a few other fancies. If you have
a CD-Rom connected, the worst it will do is display 'NO DISC' on the display
window.

I doubt the feasability of getting discount rates for UG members... I also
do not think it is appropiate to limit the "online home" to one specific
system... the online home should be the Internet... that gives the most

            I'm sure any deal similar to that is possible. Whether it
       feasable yet, is probably doubtfull. That would surely cost some money
       on the UG's part, and at this point the money that is
       available(probably not much) would be better spent on other things.
            I like the idea tho. If such an online home was established it
       would also be nice for the system to have a way of knowing whether or
       not you are a member, for cases where you want access to
       information/files that are available to members only.

  No, the drivers from Dirt Cheap use the rbf file manager. This means that

   YAY!!!!!!!!!! Will the file manager support CD-I as well???? <g> Seriously,
if I can offer any assistance, have Ray contact me (or vice-versa). I have
played around with the CD-I disks in my CD-Rom reader quite a bit. They're
a bit different tha the ISO9660 disks. The CD-Rom reader uses a special mode
to access CD-I disks.

  BTW, this beta-tester is warmed-up and ready!!!!

Given there is a 'back EMF', but under steady state conditions, non-measurable.
Thats why I alluded to the AC circuit and impedances. However, since its
readily apparent that you studied the subject at l;least as well as I have,
is it because there's more $$ in biology or what? My background is a story
to repeat (ad nauseum). I had an alchoholic old uncle who made his beer $
by fixing the "all american 5 tubers". He had a list on the wall that told
him to change this if it did that.  When I (at 6-7 years old) asked what
was wrong with the parts he changed, he couldn't tell me. I wanted to know,
and thats the story of how I got into electronics with an 8th grade
education! I've never stopped sticking my nose into things to see how they
work. My nose has been replaced with a 100 mhz dual trace scope, but not
much else has changed in the past 50 years except the steady march of
progress. While I use all kinds of "smart sand", and I've taken a mail
course or two on how its made, the fact that what is basicly sand can
actually do these things is still a case of wonderment to me at times.
But then, as I said, my reading is eclectic, and some of the stuffs I read
in the biological field are equally amazing. Cheers, Gene Heskett

Well, the reason I got a degree in bio was that  1. I was better in it in HS
than chem  2. I was never exposed to physics in HS.  My old man was a ham radio
operator from "way-back" but due to reasons I choose not to make public, I
wasn't interested in electronics at that time.  When I hit college, I had to
take physics and the professor was so bad, he and the course made no sense.
(Note: If I had it in HS, I would have survived quite nicely)  My HS did not
prepare me for college at all.  I retook the course with the head of the
department and aced it.  The original prof I had got canned.  Never really got
into it because of the way calculus was treated by the math dept.....no
applications! (Newton was spinning in his grave.)  The only thing that kept me
going was the ham radio, which I got into after the old man died.  Geez....I
even got jobs based on what I learned from that hobby.  Got into computers from
picking up an old 8080 at RS and then tried to build a machine to use it.
Even got it to work (once).  Moved from one machine to another (all orphaned)
until OSK.  Been fun.  One thing though, I've learned more teaching the
subjects I teach than I ever learned in school.  I pick up a lot in reading
but the darn job gets in the way!  Too bad I'm too numerant to buy lottery
tickets.  Then I could really have the time....

Lotery? nah. I don't think I've put more than a $20 bill in it since they made
it legal here and there years ago. Like you, I know who really makes the $ on
it,
and it darned sure isn't you or I. And as to the comments re the HS physics
stuffs (and teachers) I have to agree! I conned them into letting me sit in on
the senior class when I was in the 8th grade. Lasted about a month, till the
teach got Newtons 3rd wrong and I called him on it. Got expelled for 3 days
even if I was right! That was just one reason I gave up on "formal" schooling
lo, these many years ago. They ahd taught me how to read (but not how to spell
on a $#@%& qwerty keyboard) at around 500 per, with enough phonics to take it
from there.  So I did. Gee I wish they were still teaching phonics in schools
now.
I'm constantly amazed at the simple words children see in the paper on a daily
basis that, because they have no foundation in phonics, is total gibberish to
them! And of course, they are now in the paper business and can't spell the
flippin headline right, let alone the text! Frankly it makes me want to run for
the school board, but then I find that there is so much federal meddling in the
"approved" curriculums that we'ed all have to cover wash in hot dirt to actually

make any worthwhile changes. My wife is a teacher too, and I can tell you that
the biggest problem in the school classroom today isn't curriculum, its
discipline!
The inability of the teacher to maintain order in the classroom is because there

are no tools left for them to use to establish order in a dis-orderly class.
She has even been "on report" for yelling back at a kid who was busy useing
the whole library of 4 letter words on her! I could go on, but I'm sure the rest

of the teachers here can fill in their own horror stories.

Agreed on the teachers' stories.  Actually is not discipline but actually
allowing the teacher to do their job without some one sticking their nose in
and removing the teacher's authority.  The kids see that as a license to play
since the teacher can't do anything because they will be sitting outside the
principal's office.
As far as lotteries go, I played once.  Didn't win so I stopped.  Actually
I've found shareware kind of a lottery.  (Some one had to get back to the
thread.)  The times I have sent in money, most of the promised support was
vaporware.  Checks were cashed but no manuals, or upgrades, or bug warnings
were received.  Now this is not every one that I "registered" but enough to
make me a little skeptical when I see all the nice promises.  That was all in
the DOG world.  I have not gotten to looking at all the programs that I have
d/l'ed for OSK.  I do have to send in some bucks for some that are pretty good
eventhough I haven't used them much.  I will admit that in some cases I have
slacked off in that area.  So many programs...so few time slices. (grin)

Have you called their repair service.  Most cable companies will want to
leaks in their systems because the FCC is getting very picky about it.
Usually this will be bad outlet wiring, a bad drop or a crack in the dis-
tribution lines.  Call them up and if they don't fix it call them again.
I should warn you though that every once in a while the TV will be at fault.
Some TV's have inadequit (sp) shielding and there is nothing the cable company
can do about that.  If that is the problem they should be able to bring in a
test set and show you that it is a TV problem and not the cable.

it is the tv....problem is the signal is very strong here.....and itworks fine

it creeps in via the link between the two..There was NO problem BEFORE they

    Maybe, but it would not hurt if that person did try it. I think Lotus
does use it. it is a "standard" at worst all he will have is a garbled

hehe, thats the Relocating Macro Assembler, part of the level 2 upgrade
to the C compiler. Most folks let the rest of the compiler feed it. The
book that come with is accurate, if awfuly concise to the point of not
telling you everything of the minutae. Basicly what it does is to take
the output of either C.Pass2 or C.Opt, and translate that "assembly"
source codes nemonics into machine code the cpu understands. However,
the resultant code is not yet executable because it still needs to be
"linked" with the startup front end, and any librarys it uses. This is
why most run it as part of the C compiler itself. That makes about 90%
of all the housekeeping automatic. The corresponding linker which was
originally called "c.link" is now called "r.link" and you'll find it on
the same disk. There are "aftermarket" replacements for the compilers
executive program "cc2" which have those name conversions already done,
or you can just rename them to the older name as long as the old files
aren't around in the same path.

     From: WDTV5        To: KENTMH

Humm, that sure sounds like a clock problem. And we are infamous for that!
Whats occuring is a loss of the ability to recognize an interrupt from the
rs-232 pack. It can occur from several causes. The first, and easiest for
non-solderers to handle is to get the latest clock module for your system.
Unforch, we have at least 4xvendors solutions to the problem, and only the
one thasts right for your system will work. Furinstance, I've had a hardware
clock with battery backup so long I tend to forget there are those who still
have to set the clock time/date at bootup. And I'm inclined to think that
the jumper mod in the multipack is still a given. Thats where you pull the
pcb out of the mpi, uncover the bottom, locate pin 8 on all the sockets
for the plugins, and solder a jumper across the bottom connecting all pin
8's together. Some eeven jumper the slot switch, or jumper it all the way
to the edge connector where it plugs into the coco. With the long term
dependability of that cheep slide switch, thats not too bad an idea, but I
did not do mine that way, and I only think its hurt me once in 8-9 years.
What happened is that the clock as written for the normal distribution
os9, doesn't properly reset the Gime chips internal registers. This bug,
if you want to call it that, effectivly prevents comm progs from running
above 600 baud reliably.  With the fixed clocks, that gime toggle is
handled correctly, and no data is lost even at 9600-14,000 rates.  The mpi
fix can be required also depending on the software configuration required
to match your exact hardware. I wouldn't think of try it without it here.
But then, I'm full and wish the mpi had at least 4 MORE slots!
Anyway, if you can find the package of clocks in the database that contains
the phrase "ed9", by Eddie Kuhns, thats the best place to start. If you're
running a native mode system, then that clock for your system will still need
to be converted to run in the native mode.  In the unlikely event you are
native, and a Disto SC-II + 4n1 user, then theres a clock I converted
here in the database too. I hope this information is helpfull.
Cheers, Gene - I'll be offline for the next 2-3 weeks, vacation and all that.

Glad you like it, Ken.  I've learned a lot about "C", the GNU  GCC

Can anybody out there please tell me how to use higher speeds than 4800 baud
under OS9? Right now I am using a converted DC Modem Pak with Sacia at 4800
I can't seem to get reliable operation at 9600 baud w/ this combo, though. I
assume that the problem is that I don't have hardware handshaking. I would use
a better RS-232 device, but none of them ever worked properly. Any help will be

Mark, sales of NitrOS-9 are currently "on hold", pending release of
the upcoming new release (v1.20), slated for later this month.  The authors
are madly working at putting together a new package, incorporating a lot
of the feedback they got from users at the Chicago Fest.  (Yes, the RBF
compatibility problem with 'lha' is fixed, amongst other things.  And a
totally different approach to installation.)

Distribution arrangements for the new version are still being arranged,
but Northern Xposure will definitely be involved.

Yes, I went throught the same process, I did get an OSK system, but still
use my coco.

Actually, the coco can multitask more smoothly than a rather high-end MS-Dos
system.  As an example, I log into a local BBS.  It is operating a 486-40,
I believe.  I have no problem knowing when the Sysop is doing something.
I will type 5 or so letters sometimes before they come back to me.  Really

When you think of the quality of OS9, or OSK, unless you truly need the
compatibility, you can't go wrong staying with it.

from Radio Shack via the consumer mail #. Ask the store if you can look at
the consumer mail catalog. There has been a number posted here...I HAVE IT!

..Well this is the Express order line. It may get you there too. The number
is 1-800-321-3133. I don't have a catalog number. I ordered TS-spell back in
February for $11.54. The Dev pack may be pretty cheap these days too. If you
do order it, please leave a note to me here. Thata way others will have the
info. Tell them it's a CMC product when you call. That will notify them to
look in the consumer mail catalog (CMC). Hope this helps.

Boisy,

  > Rebel Assault is "in the works" for CD-i!

    I hate to be the bearer of bad news. I noticed your arrival in one of the
CD-i sigs on c-serve, but I believe you came in about 2-3 weeks too late for
the discussion on Rebel Assault. Apparently, for several reasons, the only
one of which that was detailed being that it wouldn't be ready for the
upcomming Christmas season, the CD-i DV version of RA has been shelved
"indefinitely". A LOT of people seemed unhappy about that. I really couldn't
understand why. The only time I've seen the game was at Winter CES in Vegas,
but I didn't think it was all that much. There must be much more to it than I
saw.

  > I would *love* to see a CD-i disk with the old classic arcade games...

    I've seen a few people mention this, and it always surprises me how
dedicated people are to those old games. If it would sell more players, I'd
be all for it. Actually, though, the 2 best old classic arcade games are
already on CD-i, Dragon's Lair and Space Ace! :) Frankly, I went to an arcade
here 2 years ago willing to buy their old beat up arcade Space Ace machine for
$700.00, so getting it on CD-i is like a dream, and all those other disks are
just a bonus!

    You know its funny that I think this is probably the only CD-i discussion
going on on Delphi. For awhile now I've been wondering why it doesn't have its
own section here. Of course, its hard to beat C-Serve with several Philips
people and a slew of CD-i developers online.

Ken,

  > I rent one here in Phoenix at a used video game store...

    What store here rents CD-i players? I have heard that there were 2
Blockbuster video stores that rent them, but I have no idea which 2 they're
at.

  > They stated that the CD's were hard to find but I get mine at Incredible
  > Universe.

    That was true not so long ago, but since Incredible Universe came to town
Best Buy has gotten better in their CD-i support, depending on which location
you go to. Between the Superstition Springs and Scottsdale Pavillions locations
I've found a considerable number of titles, plus the Scottsdale location now
has the DV cartridge.

  > I have not yet seen the new cheaper Magnavox model...

    Service Merchandise on Southern is displaying it. In fact its the only
model they stock.

  > Incredible Universe did not seem to have the Magnavox model...

    I was there this evening. They only had about 7 Philips 220's left. One
of the pro-CD-i sales persons there told me they're selling about 2-3 per week.
That is, compared to less than half as many 3DO players. (Did you notce they're
offering 2 free disks just to get people to buy 3Do players?)

  > The CD-i seems to have 3 to 4 times the available software (than 3DO)...

    Either you haven't been there in awhile or you've been confused by the
oversized 3DO software packaging. They've expanded the CD-i software area at
the expense of area devoted to 3DO software. There are less than 15 3DO titles
there, compared to at least 60-70 CD-i titles, (ok, maybe your 4 times figure
is pretty close :) ).

    Incredible Universe does have it hands down for extent of CD-i support,
but I would suggest looking into Best Buy a little more. You mentioned that
you buy your disks from IU, but for the ones that are also available at Best
Buy, Best Buy sells them for less, (and they were the people who were nice
enough to extend me the considerable credit needed to get the 220, DV card and
several titles!) :)

    The Sears CD-i horror story doesn't surprise me at all. If I had to
depend on my neighborhood sears for CD-i, I would never even give it a
second look. Although it is usually running, the display is pitiful. They
haven't updated their software list since 92. They don't even have titles

     From: REVWCP       To: ALL

Dear friends:
     Once  again  from  the depths of the  obscure  equipment  and
unknown  hardware  bin, I have managed to obtain  an  interesting
piece  of practical peripherality.  (Hold on it will probably  get
worse.)   I  picked up an AVAL PKW 1000.  Now what is an AVAL PKW
1000, you may ask?  Go ahead, I'll wait while you ask.  Funny you
should  ask,  it is a self-contained EPROM programmer.  It has  a
hex keyboard 0-F, and 8 commands keys:

     LOD  RST
     ERS  JOB
     PRG   -
     CMP  SET

on a control panel about the size of a calculator.  It is labeled
a  Pecker 10 Intelligent Programmer.  To the right of the control
panel is a socket adapter, about 3x5 inches labeled FX-1.  It has
a  zero insertion force socket and will take either 24 or 28  pin
eproms.   It lists that it can program 2716 up to 27C256  eproms.
The  socket adapter is removable and other types of eproms  could
be  used  with the appropriate adapter.  There is a Parallel  I/O
port connector and an RS-232 jack on the back.

Overall,  the unit is about one foot square and about 2-3  inches
deep.   It  plugs into a standard outlet.  Unfortunately, it  did
not  come  with any instructions.  Has any one ever heard of  the
company?   If  so  does  any one know of where  I  might  get  an
instruction  manual?   This is a real nice looking unit  and  the
preliminary  test  that  I have performed suggest that it  is  in
working  order.   Now  as much as I have never been  one  to  let
facts  stand  in the way of my making a decision, I would like to
have at least a vague idea of how to use this piece of equipment.

         program update
     From: CPERRAULT    To: DBREEDING

            I'm just bringing you up to date on what happened with the
       program since I last talked to you. I did change the command line to
       put the ',' between the two quoted parameters and it did return the
       filenames from the text file. Now my next problem was, it would return
       all those files, but keep returning them over in over again. What I
       was doing was, I had a for/next loop(which I probably didn't need
       since I was getting the names from a file, not keyboard) that kept
       count on the files coming in. Problem? It was on the OUTSIDE of my
       While/do/endwhile loop, instead of the inside! At least this one was a
       simple solution<G>. The good news is, I'm just about done. I have one
       more bug to work out, which knock on wood, looks like I will have
       fixed today. Then I will just clean up the code and then change the
       parameter structure. I'm gonna make it so that instead of having to or
       three different variables, I'll combine them all into a complex data
       type, so they don't have to be seperated with commas. After that, I'll
       doc it up,LZH it and get it into the database so I can start on my
       next program<yippie>.
            This is getting fun ;-)

Mark,

Brother Jeremy has received permission to port Max-10 to OS-9.  He also
has the source code.  It will take time, but the port will probably
happen.  At this time, the best word processor for OS-9 is probably
Dynastar, but I don't think it is available commercially anymore from
Frank Hogg.  However, maybe someone here will sell you a copy.
Alternatively, there are many text editors available in the data
base, and they can be integrated with WPShel available from COLORSYSTEMS
here.  In doing that, you add a spell checker and a viewer and a text
formatter and you will have your own full-fleged word processor.

Dear Mark:
This past spring I requested and received the source code for MAX-10 from
Dave Stampe.  I have given the code to a team of five programmers and they
are working on the project.  I hope to have a formal notice out about the
progress of the port at the end of August.
