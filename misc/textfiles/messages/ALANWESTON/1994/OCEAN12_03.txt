For those out of the loop, errors have been identified in the FDIV
(floating point divide) command of Intel's Pentium chip. Apparently
Intel has known about this for some time and chose to keep it quiet
while they designed new chips. Intel has not announced any plans to
replace the bad chips already distributed, and has instead released a
press release saying that the problem shouldn't bother most people.

Q&A:  THE PENTIUM FDIV BUG
Q:   How many Pentium designers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
A:   1.99904274017, but that's close enough for non-technical people.
Q:  What do you get when you cross a Pentium PC with a  research grant?
A:   A mad scientist.
Q:  What's another name for the "Intel Inside" sticker they put on
Pentiums?
A:  Warning label.
Q:  What do you call a series of FDIV instructions on a Pentium?
A:  Successive approximations.
Q:  Complete the following word analogy:  Add is to Subtract as Multiply
is to
        1)  Divide
        2)  ROUND
        3)  RANDOM
        4)  On a Pentium, all of the above
A:  Number 4.
Q:  What algorithm did Intel use in the Pentium's floating point divider?
A:  "Life is like a box of chocolates." (Source: F. Gump of Intel)
Q:  Why didn't Intel call the Pentium the 586?
A:  Because they added 486 and 100 on the first Pentium and got
585.999983605.
Q:  According to Intel, the Pentium conforms to the IEEE standards
754 and 854 for floating point arithmetic.  If you fly in aircraft
designed using a Pentium, what is the correct pronunciation of
"IEEE"?
A:   Aaaaaaaiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeee!
