I don't think so, I did not sell many of those. I sold 100+ 2-Meg boards.
However, if you really are interested, I do have schematics and software. We

Actually, the CPU in the CoCo 3 is the 68B09E, and you presumably have a
63C09E as a replacement chip.  The "E" suffix means "external clock," so
that the clock signal goes to the 63C09E just as it does to the 68B09E
originally in the CoCo 3.

This is something that should be considered in making many different types
of purchases, and of course, this is one area in which special regard should
be given.  In my case, I live in a rather rural area, and it's hard to
just run in and get the part, most everything has to be ordered.

That would add a disadvantage to the GNU route..  Are there any restrictions
on distributing software compiled under GCC, or 3.2, for that matter?  I
contacted Tandy regarding the CoCo compiler, and they sent me a letter
stating that all that code could be considered PD in regard to distributing
compiled code.

That seems to be an unreasonable requirement..  I've seen the argument that
code should be provided with software, but IMO, that only gives anyone
license to tinker with your stuff.  It can be altered without your knowledge
or permission and released under your name, causing you possible embarassment,
at the very least.  I think Carl Kreider had a problem with this with his
"ar".. He had only gone up to 1.2, I believe, and there were versions up to
1.5 floating around.  It caused him quite a bit of a hassle, as I understand
it.

 There are no restrictions distributing and/or selling code compiled with and
 using the libraries provided with either 3.2 or Ultra-C.  Indeed, MW gives
 permission to distribute, at no charge, 'csl', the replacement for 'cio' and
 the math module with the code if it is compiled with Ultra-C.  To the best of
 my knowledge, this type of policy is universal regardless of what software
 house sells you their compiler.  To the best of my knowledge, there are no
 restrictions on code distribution for code compiled with the GNU compiler
 if you _don't_ use their libraries.

 Can you clarify that?  Are you saying programmers cannot charge for software
 if they use the CoCo C-Compiler and libraries?  (PD would imply that.)

     PowerBasic for OS9/68000 ships!
     From: FHOGG        To: ALL

"This new language (PowerBasic) may be the most significant thing to
come along for OS9 in the last ten years!"

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> NOW SHIPPING <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

                     PowerBasic for OS9/68000

Finally, someone wrote a BASIC compiler for OS9!

PowerBasic is the only native (68000) code BASIC compiler for use with
the OS-9/68000 Operating System.

------

I've just uploaded information on PowerBasic to the DL. Two files, one
gives the promo information and the other covers a introductory offer
that saves you $50 if ordered by the end of the month. Over the next
several days I will be uploading a more complete technical spec and
examples in PowerBasic source and object that you can try on your own
computer. I've downloaded a whole bunch of Basic09 programs from the DL
here and I plan to use some of them as examples also. My intent is to
see and show what is involved in converting regular Basic09 type
programs to PowerBasic and what speed and size advantages there are. If
you have any other suggestions you would like to see me try please let
me know.

I got my copy of PowerBasic just before Thanksgiving and have been
getting up to speed on it. So far I like it very much. The compiler runs
fast and the resultant code generated is also fast. Much much faster
than Basic09. I've been having fun looking at the '.a' files to see what
assembler code is generated by PowerBasic and to watch how changes in
the Basic program effect the assembler code. PowerBasic makes this easy
because the Basic source line is inserted into the '.a' file as a
comment.

PowerBasic object is stand alone, no 'runb' type of thing is needed. I
like this because it keeps the whole project as one program. No need to
worry about having all the pieces needed to make something work.

I'm looking for feedback so please feel free to ask questions and make
suggestions.

Thanks

 Ever since you first announced Basix way back when I was interested in the
 project. I know at the time it was aimed at the Gwindows environment, so I
 tried to keep tabs on the project, since I am a Basic Enthusiast. Also, since
I am still in the market for an OSK machine, I wanted
 to be sure what environment this compilor would run on, so I could
 keep that in mind when deciding on what machine to buy when the $$ is at
 my disposal.(this won't be the case for a while still :-( )
  It's good to know this program is aimed at the broad market and not limited
 to a specific Windowing system(tho I will most likely aim everything I write
at  a Gwindows and/or Kwindows Evironment). This will promote
 as much developement as possible.

Thank you for your support of the concept. We do plan an extension for
G-Windows beyond what can be done with the C library. I have had some
preliminary talks with Steve Adams about adding G-Windows support directly to
PB and he was supportative. Of course
 that is a way off but we are thinking of it.

Mike wanted PB to be good enough so that he would not have to program in either
C or assembler again. He wants to do drivers and other system type stuff with
it. I want to do GW development with it. With our combined desires about the
capabilities of it wi
ll make quite a powerful product. IMHO.

For the first question see my message 90904. A GFX type of capability is in the
future. However because PB can call C Libs you can use the GW dev pak as is
just like you do with C. Mind you I havn't actually done that yet but as soon
as I get caught up wit
h stuff I will. I hope to upload a series of files that have source and bins
showing off PB.

On OS-9000... Yes but just future plans at this time. The door is being left
open in the code for other CPUs like Intel and PowerPC. As PB includes inline
asm it would be a bit of trouble but it can be done.

 Expanding on Allen's question, is PowerBasic capable of generating either
 68000 and 68020 instructions?  Does it adjust branch instructions for byte,
 word and long offsets or use a default offset?  Does it support the newer
 FPU trap module in place of the MATH trap module?  Is the CIO or the newer
 CSL (in place of CIO) trap module required or does PowerBasic take care
 of these functions?  Does PowerBasic include a code optimizer?

 In 'powerbasic.info' you state -

 What is the difference between the version for 'Personal Users' and the
 version for 'Commercial/Industrial Users'?  If no difference, may either
 category distribute/sell code compiled with PowerBasic without paying
 any further license fees or is the last sentence intended to apply to
 'Commercial/Industrial Users' only?  If either category may distribute/sell
 code, what is the difference between Personal and Commercial/Industrial?

A later version is planned for 32 bit machines so you could just recompile at a
later time. However I have no timeframe for when that would be. The general
plan is to work on version 2 using feedback from version 1 users as well as
things he wants to do.

Because PB uses the math module for FP the 68882 would be supported thru that.

Yes it does use the assembler and linker that you have now. At your option you
can diddle with the '.a' file if you want.

 Version 1.0 is 68000 only.

 (this from Mike)
 Neither. It uses a caculated relative global jump or jsr.
 ...This code (from Mike) is what is used.
 move.l #dest-*-8,a2
 jmp (pc,a2.l)
 (if then) etc uses words. Uses byte for things when it knows it can.

 (I hope I typed that in right, I am NOT a 68K assembly programmer, that's
 why  I wanted PowerBasic.)

 > Does it support the newer FPU trap module in place of the MATH trap module?

 It uses the math trap.

 > Is the CIO or the newer CSL (in place of CIO) trap module required or does

 PB takes care of it. It doesn't use CIO.
 It uses 3 OS9 resources, some OS9 system calls, the standard MATH trap module,
 and the sys.l library. Also refers to oskdefs.

 > Does PowerBasic include a code optimizer?

 Not in version 1.0. Planned for a later version. However there is some
 internal optimizing.

 They are both the same in all respects except for price. It is our intent
 to support the individual user and to promote development with PowerBasic
 by offering a lower cost version for individuals such as those here on
 Delphi and over on CIS.
 Promotions to commercial/industrial users do not mention the personal pricing.

 I will be uploading a group of benchmark programs in Basic09 source,
 PowerBasic source and PowerBasic object that you can look at and run on
 your own machine so you can compare that aspect of PB. I will also upload
 part of a '.a' file of one of the benchmarks so you can look at an example
 of how PB does its thing. I hope to get to that this weekend.

I do have the source list right here, although it is the 1989
edition.  I do see some OS9 mentioned in some ads in Control Engineering,
I&CS, Intek, and other trade magazines, but it is rare to see much.  I
get complementary subscriptions to many of these including Embedded
Systems.  It mentions OS9 once or twice every other issue or so.  Until
OS9000 came out, there was nothing (inexpensively and commonly available)
to run OS9 on.  I guess I'll stand by my statement in the previous
message that those companies represent 99 (or so) percent of the
industrial controls market and that most small systems are MS-Windows
based.  It's really amazing that they have been able to do as much
as they have with Windows.

believe), and Confirmed by Mike Guzzi (ApBBS Pensylvania 1-717-586-2771) was
interactively (not using a file and the -s option of modpatch) screwed up cc3io
royally... Then I tried the -s option and the file method, most bytes this time
around gave me a "byte does not match" warning, but other than that seems to
function MOSTLY... I was wondering if there was a specific patch needed or not
for this version of CC3io.dr

Edition: $10
Mod CRC: $F737C2      <Modified for RGB default and slower kbd io: $8C69BA >

     Any help is appreciated...

Also speaking of Mods.... I heard there was a 1 byte mod for os9p1 that seemed
to cut down on the overhead considerably enough that 9600bps was reliable...
     I have the Eddie Kuns Edition 9 Clock Modules < Bigger than Level II's
Edition 9 clock modules>, SACIA, VRN, and NIL added to increase speed, but only
wound up with at best a near 100% ability of ANSI at 4800bps using Supercomm
2.2.

Thanks in advance...

     An outstanding bug in OS-9
     From: GREGL        To: ALL

This is a short text message that demonstrates some very blatant bugs that exist

under all current versions of OS-9 Level 1 and Level 2 for the Color Computer.

This bug makes it effectively impossible to send multi-byte control codes over
the modem and any attempt to do so will result in your cursor being homed and
the control codes effectively ignored.  A few of us have been hounding Tandy and

Microware to fix this bug but nothing has resulted, and indeed some even thought

we were completely CRAZY!  Well, you judge for yourself.

Most terminal programs handly data a byte at the time and this SHOULD work but
unfortunately due to some error it causes multi-byte control codes, such as
underline, blink, boldface, etc. to not function at all.

One method that I have discovered that does work is to adapt an "emulation"
scheme to your terminal program.  This requires you to read incoming data
normally until you recognize the receipt of a control code (less than $20, or
space) and then do some buffering.  For example, if you receive a $02 to
position the cursor, you should flush the buffer to the screen, get the x and y
coordinates, and then I$Write $02,x,y all at once and then continue receiving
normally.  Any other method is guaranteed to fail miserably.

For those of you that still think I am completely off my rocker, here is an
that says you have "textrlined" at the top of your screen looking all screwy.

     Outstanding bug found and fixed
     From: GREGL        To: ALL

Zap. Found the bug. Seems that SCF is throwing a SS.Close call in between the
display statements and multi-byte control sequences that are received
separately. Okay perhaps, but CC3IO stores any get/set stat calls in the SAME
spot that it stores char outputs! So what happens?

CC3IO stores the first 1F of the 1F22 call (underline on), then the SS.Close
($2A) gets stuck on top of the 1F, then the 22 comes in.... CC3IO etc gets
confused and thinks we have a 1B call, and grfint tries to do a "1B 22 ...."
overlay window setup!! Oooops.

Solution is to just not store the stat calls, and change a LBRA to go around a
little thing (tech talk- sorry). If I'm too far off here, change the following
in CC3IO when nothing else is going on:

  Offset Old New
   778    A7  12
   779    C8  12
   77A    1F  12
   79F    4B  4E
   9EE    A7  12
   9EF    C8  12
   9F0    1F  12
   A2D    BD  C0


and of course reverify CC3IO and save it out or recobbler the disk. This should
fix things. - Kev !

I was amazed to see an actual well done ad for the CD-I platform.  I think

     2nd Hard Drive
     From: CHARLESAM    To: ALL

I'm trying to get a 2nd HD working and having problems. The first thing that
I notice is the drive indicator light is on as soon as I power up. Of course
that shouldn't be. After I configured an H1 module and put it in my boot, I
booted and did a dir /h1. Lock up! Any thoughts on the subject will be
appreciated. I'm using 2 ST277-Ns and a Kenton controller. The jumper
sleeve for H1 is on the first set of pins closest to the center. Since H1
is the first drive on the cable, I removed the 3 sets of pins off the
bottom of the drive. Thats all I can think of now. Thanx Charlie

     From: WA2EGP       To: CHARLESAM (NR)

I had a similar problem.  Make sure that both of the hard drives have some type
of device selection such as h0 is #1 and h1 is #2.  If you leave the jumper
off of the first one (which most do since there is only one drive on the SCSI
buss) it trys to read everything, including what is being sent to the second
drive.  In SCSI, each device needs to have an ID number from 0 to 7, whether
a "driver" like the controller card or a "device" like a hard drive or other
media.  They must be unique for each thing connected.  I went in circles
until someone explained it to me verrrrrry carefully (grin).  Hope that solves
the problem (and I explained it OK).

The fact the LED is on when it powers up is a problem, does it do that if
you disconnect the SCSI cable?

I have seen this and might have an answer for you.  I also have the KEN-TON
system and am quite pleased with it.  You might be having a terminator
problem.  There is one pin on the drive (don't remember which) that is on
the center terminator that is called "Drive Attention" or something like
that.  The KEN-TON system does not use this pin and when the terminators
are removed it can get screwed up and lock the system.  You might try to
find this pin and terminate just that one.  A good test would be to put the
center terminator back in for a test.

I do not think this will help the drive light problem but it can be a
cause of the SCSI buss locking up.  -Mark-

     PowerBASIC details?
     From: JEJONES      To: FHOGG

I've downloaded the files you uploaded about PowerBASIC, and I have a few
questions about the language.

 - What data structuring facilities does it have (e.g. is there anything
   analogous to the BASIC09 TYPE statement)?
 - You say it supports separate compilation; does that mean that there are
   actual functions with local variables?  What's the syntax for calling a
   separately compiled unit, passing parameters (including structured types
   if the language supports them), and returning results?
 - What debugging facilities does PowerBASIC have?  (All I saw mentioned
   in the file was a listing of assembly language output with the PowerBASIC
   source interspersed.)

If you could post or upload a sample of PowerBASIC code displaying some of
its features, that would help a lot.  Thanks.
