Am I correct in understanding you are selling the CoNect Rs232 Pak?  If so,
what are the terms?  I need a First Class Pak!

Renting of CD-i machines in Phoenix is from a store called "GAMERS"
My local one is at 35th Ave and W. Thunderbird Rd.
Glad to hear that Best Buy now has more CD-i titles to choose from.
You said that the prices were cheaper.  I paid $17.95 at IU for Mozart.
That is about the price for audio CD.  I will check out Best Buy to
see how their price compares.  We have a store at Metro Center.
If you find the BlockBuster in Phoenix that rents CD-i titles, let me
know.  I heard that in San Francisco, they are testing the CD-i but
I had not heard about a Phoenix test.  My sources have been
a Video Magazine and Game Pro Magazine.  The Video Mag I found in
the Phoenix libraries and We subscribe to Game Pro.

CAREFUL!
I see that someone mentioned the autoex file in your CMDS directory.
It is the same as multistart with a new name but it does start
automagically.
I NEVER anymore use that file since I got locked out of my hard drives.
I now always use multistart to bring up MultiView.  What is one more
key stroke as opposed to losing access to the hard drives.
I guess the method is fine for a floppy only system.
BTW, being a careful fellow, I do the same thing with Windows on my
PC and always boot up in DOS and then call up Windows.
Well, that's my 1 cent worth!

I would start up what you are obviously referring to as "multivue" (Multi-Vue
is the entire package of GUI support modules and utilities. The actual
graphics shell is GShell.) with the command:

gshell <>>>/w&

Of course, this requires that all of your window devices be patched to be
Type 1 or 2 Hardware Windows and that the mouse has been configured if
you are using a hires mouse.

Good point.  I never used M-V myself, as it just didn't cut it, really.  Like
you, On my System 5, I don't (yet) boot into GWindows, maybe later.

However, RE: getting locked out of the HD, you could always have an emergency
boot disk that would boot to the floppy.  You could leave out the HD
descriptor in the boot, or rename it to something else (like "hf" or
something).  Or, if you have your Sysgo set to boot to "/dd", then you could
have the emergency disk with "/dd" set to /d0.

Funny you should mention that subject (HD Lockout). I changed my shell
module last month so I could better run Cocotop. Forgot to set the attr
to 'e pe '. Result= lockout. I just finished making the boot you describe.
I just had to add h0 and hdisk to a floppy boot and change cc3go from h0
to d0. Works fine. Now I'll make a few backups just in case. I'm forever
getting locked out due to forgetting to set the attributes after merging
new modules. I never learn. I was without my hard drive for a month due
to being to busy to straighten out the error. What was worst was my games
are on the HD, and I was too busy to dig out the originals to play from
floppy. No games for a month. Geez, it was bad, but the wife loved it.
She got to see my face for change. ;-) Of course, after a month of looking
at my sour puss, she's probably thrilled to see my back again. Now let me
finish up here and get on to Solitaire. I believe everyone must make this

Are you using source written for the "ASM" assembler?  This would have
the " mod" directive toward the begin of the program.  If so, this is the
problem.  There is a little difference in the directives.  "RMA" needs the
"psect" directive, and the "endsect" (or "ends") at the end.  Check your
docs for details.

One other thing... are you putting in the spaces at the correct place?
You need a space before the opcode (no space before a label definition).
Oh yes, you need a space before the "psect", and the psect MUST come before
any vsects.

If you have typed in the example listing correctly, it should work..

Actually OS-9 term programs with a standard 6551A UART can only
handle throughput of about 4800 bps reliably on my unmodified 6809 CoCo
systems.

Under Disk Basic, U-term can connect at 14.4 without character loss and
download with a throughput of about 1000 cps.

Under RSDOS using ultimaterm, I have been able to open up my sportster modem
to the full 14400 baud rate (port speed 19200 baud) with no problem. under
os9 9600 seems to be the limit. I am very close to being able to do 19200
under os9. maybe a new release of nitros-9 will give the tweek of speed i
need to get it. (adjusting the timeslicing would probably do the trick)

Frank,

I assume you're MODPATCH'ing from the keyboard?  You can also modpatch from
a file.  I prefer this method over keyboard, since I'm prone to hit the wrong
key then <ENTER> before I catch it <G>.

If you do this, you can either :

     modpatch filename patchfile
                   or
     modpatch filename < patchfile

Either way works.  Some hints:

  1. Don't leave an empty line in the file (you know, simply CR).  Modpatch
     will abort.
  2. I think you can use the command "q" to quit, not sure, but otherwise,
     the end of file will end it (I think).

Modpatch will work on any type module in memory.

Hi Bill,
  You are using OS-9 Level 2 right?  I do seem to think you stated
that in one of your messages.  I just opened my manual and found
that Modpatch is on 4 pages not 2.  Someone else left a list of
the options and commands associated with Modpatch, so I shall not persue

this any longer.  One more thought though, the last copyright date
in mine is 1986, what is yours?  I do have another copy of OS-9
Level 2 in the shrinkwrap that I might be willing to part with if
you would like to be "more current".  It cost me some $$$ though, so
would would not be able to just "give" it away. :-)  This copy does
have a binder with it too.  Let me know.  See ya.

Frank,

My OS-9 manual must be an early one too, then.  I bought it in Chicago
while I was there on business.  The CoCo announcement about Rat Shack's
discontinued support had occurred about a week before.  A business trip
was scheduled for many parts of the country at that time, and I would
cruise local Rat Shacks for CoCo stuff.

I learned how to use Modpatch from the people here!

Yeah, things like that are sometimes real stumpers, and makes you want to slap
yourself on the head when you see it.  I've done this many times.  Most times
I'll edit a while, list the prog (paper companies just LOVE me <G>), then
edit some more... list...

I had my first coco some time before I got a printer.  Talk about having a
hard time debugging....  You can look all day at a screen and often never
find the problem... look at a printout and that semicolon that doesn't
belong just jumps out at ya..

 The good news is, I'm just about done.

Great!  Will be looking for it.

BTW.. If you're doing a lot of Basic programming, do you have "gfx3"?
It's something like "gfx2" I wrote some years back.  Does a lot of the
get/setstatt calls.  I think it makes programming somewhat easier.  Dunno
if it's still up or not.. someone else uploaded it, as I was not online
at that time.

        I'm the same way. Without a printer I don't even bother trying to
   code, as the screen just seems to complicate it for some reason. I
   can't understand what it is, as you would thing one display is similar

        Yes, I have it, but haven't yet played around with it. I do plan
   on getting familiar with  it after my next couple programming projects
   are finished. It looks like a very usefull package!
        Btw, yes it is on Delphi. This is where I got it :-)

I'm assuming it's the same one I did.  Actually, as I stated in the docs,
I got the idea from a Basic version by Dale Puckett, so I can't claim
credit for originating the idea.  I did it in assembly, gave the option
of whether to use the path # or not, and tried to make it more like "gfx2"
in syntax to avoid confusion.  I used the package some bit when I fooled
with Basic09.  It seemed to simplify doing the calls.

I hasten to add that

1. The Knuth books are classics in their field (and the algorithms are
   given in a fairly rigidly structured flowchart plus English form as
   well as in MIX assembler (a mythical machine loosely inspired by
   architectures current when Knuth first wrote the books), so they're
   quite useful.  They're encyclopedic up to the time of writing.

2. Sedgewick, if I remember correctly, studied under Knuth, and his books
   are, while not as monumental, more modern, and well worth your while.

Actually,Kermit should work even over telnet or rlogin connections.
Haven't tried it, but I've heard about people using it over telnet before,
though there could be some slight trick.
    Especially with windowing Kermit, it should even be quite fast,
although I don't recall if delphi supports windowing Kermit or not.

Delphi doesn't allow you to uuencode online, but you can uuencode a file
on your home system and upload it to your workspace on Delphi and send
it via mail or ftp to another computer on the internet.  The other
person would download it to their home computer and then uudecode it.

Usually there is no size limit for internet mail.  I have sent uuecoded
files that were up to 900K+.

Nope, and despite Kermit having had sliding windows for around eight years,
Delphi hasn't upgraded their Kermit, nor do they apparently have any plans
to do so--though IMHO anyone with an opinion on the matter should send email
to SERVICE and express his or her opinion.

        Ok, how's about Monday at 10:00 pm? The time difference between
   the coasts is a big pain, one of the reasons I liked Sunday. You don't
   have to worry about what time you come on during the weekends. I guess
   we could start out at the 10:00 pm slot, and if that doesn't work out,
   we can start a half hour or hour later and see if that makes a
   difference.

        So far here's what I have planned for those interested. It will
   be one conference, similar to Boisy's but with more of slant towards
   OS-9 level II and general Coco stuff. The topics will vary widely. I'd
   like to have some devoted to programming related stuff, as well as
   interviews/discussions with Vendors and other influencial people in
   the community regarding their products and services. It would also be
   nice to have some nights devoted to software programs new and old,
   just to cover them since there is a lot of Coco software out there
   that is almost unheard of for some reason. Oh yeah, OS-9 in General
   will also be covered in many ways :-)
        Hopefully we'll start getting a big turnout for these after they
   start, and maybe then we'll be able to start spinoff conferences
   dedicated to topics that are overly popular.
        See Ya

     A Coco Level II conference sounds great! Maybe you can discuss some
basics of OS-9 users like me who have not traditionaly understood the details
of system modules and how they relate. I'm kind of late in the game when it
comes to OS-9. I would like to eventually write some programs but It's very
difficult to get any real help with the basics. Most good books on the subject
are out of print. I would like at least one conference time to discuss the ins
and outs of building new boot disks. I pull my hair out because I have no idea
when I might be creating the BLOB problem or going over the memory limit for
the boot file. BOOT FAILED doesn't give much detail! I also can't get anyone
to explain the mfree command in detail. The manual is to vaugue. I don't know
how many users are in this catagory. This conference is something I need to
hear. I've sat in on others in the past, but they're usually over my head. I
won't ever be able to contribute to the OS-9 community if I can't get the
basics down. Understanding Level II will allow me to prepare for the OSK
environment that someday I'll enter. Mondays work fine for me BTW. I'll
be watching for your first conference. Thanks

        Well, keep in mind I'm not a real guru myself, and my knowledge
   is limited compared to many others, but I am hoping some of those in
   the know will also be at the conferences, and perhaps schedual some
   people to appear on nights to talk about certain topics<ala OS-9
   Live!>. I should be able to be of help with your boot problems as well
   as any beginner/startup information, as I've been through that
   battlefield before, and on the good side have gained some knowledge
   from it. The opening conference is not going to be limited to any one
   topic, and will basically be a laid back/informal conference to get
   started, so bring your questions about the boot problems and whatever
   else. I'll see if I can help you out with that. Also, I remember you
   posting something about it recently when I really didn't get a chance
   to get back to it. Can you point me to the message number so I can
   reread it? I can't remember exactly what the problem was.
        Btw, I STRONGLY encourage anyone with boot problems, or questions
   about their boot files to have the utility 'Smap' handy. It is in the
   utility database here as part of a 4 or 5 utility package, of which I
   forget the name of the whole package, but if you sea for it under the
   keywords of either Smap or Kdarling, it should lead you to it. You
   should have these programs handy in your cmds directory no matter
   what, but Smap is especially usefull in figuring out if your OS9Boot
   file is taking up to much system memory, which is a common cause of
   post boot trouble.

        Btw, I'll officially post the first conference and all details to
   the conferences real soon<don't want to make anything definate yet,
   until I am clear of all those little details myself>.

        Btw, if there are any vendors who are interested in schedualing a
   conference to announce any new products or discuss any existing
   products, leave me some email so I can schedual ya'. The same goes for
   User group representatives, publishers, or anyone else with a project
   they want to discuss. As I said, to start, this conference will cover
   a pretty broad area, and we can just let things evolve from there.

     I sat in on the OS-9 live conf about data modules. Some info on how
to do these under level II will be posted soon. We should encourage, and
I do HERE encourage, anyone interested in OS-9 to sit in on the conferences
whether they are OSK or Level II. Though the form may be different the
function is the same. I don't think this info would have been posted if I
hadn't represented the Level II users in the OS-9 Live conf. The OSK users
usually have a level II back ground and are very helpful as well. I am
certainly hungry for some good OS-9 knowledge. Between these two confs I
hope to gain some useful knowledge. I'm anxious for your conf to begin. I
appreciate you taking the time to organize this for all level II users.

There's getting to be some pretty good software out for OSK now.  I've not
purchased a lot yet, have "ix" on order, will be getting text software soon,
not ordered yet, probably go with "ved".

I download "QWK" packets from my local BBS... I have one for the CoCo -
"scribe".  Also got The "GNU" package ("ATP") here for my OSK machine.  The
OSK program has more features (a couple missing, though); I use the OSK
system here due to speed in going through the messages.

At this time, I depend more on my CoCo for most telecom purposes (especially
till "ix" comes in).  At this time, I don't have a really superb general-
purpose telecom program for my System 5.  I understand one is due to come out
shortly, and I understand that OSTerm has been ported to the MM/1.

There's still plenty of life left in the CoCo, and I hope to keep mine set up
for some time.

BOISY gave you a solution.. There's also a patch for the Disto CC3Disk..
Should be available here.  The original didn't remove the Interrupt from the
polling table during a TERMination, thus soon filling up the Polling table.

Either fix should work.

     CD-i Update
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

Time for another CD-i update...

I picked up the Digital Video Cartridge today, along with Dragon's Lair
(remember the old coin-op?) and The Firm.

Installing the cartridge was easy.  All I had to do was pop the slim
cover from the back of the player, insert the cartridge, and give it a firm
push so that the connector made contact.  That was it.

I turned on the player... same as usual.  Nothing showed up to indicate
I had the new full motion video cartridge installed.  I slipped in Dragon's
Lair....


TOTALLY AWESOME!  Just as I remembered it!  The full motion video is sweet,
and the sound is superb on my stereo system.  Except instead of standing
up at a machine, throwing quarters in a slot, I can kick back on the
sofa and play for free!

After playing with that game for a while, I inserted Disc One of "The Firm"
(it's a 3 CD set).  Boy, oh boy!  The video looks just as good as a VCR,
if not better, and the sound is crisp!  While the movie is playing, you can
press one of the action buttons, and a small menu bar comes up at the
bottom.  From there you can use the mouse to pause (and we're talking
crystal clear pausing here folks, picture perfect), rewind, fast forward
and set volume up or down as needed.  Rewind isn't the same as on your
VCR.  It seems to send out a picture every in increments of 10 to 15 seconds,
which increases the longer you have it rewinding or fast forwarding.

Slow motion is fantastic!  None of this jerky stuff like a VCR.  And the
slow motion speed is adjustable.

And of course, this is all under OS-9.  That's the amazing part... all of
this software is written under OS-9.

  Did you try freeze frame with a move running ?  It's really different!
The picture is a screen dump AND the CD keeps running the sound track!
When you un-freeze, the TV screen is updated to where the sound track
is at, at that instant.  Try that with a VCR <G>.

    Yeah, I always make sure to point out to people that its just an MM/1
with an extra VSC chip running those titles. Of course, when I really think

  How about, so you can realy see a fast action `shot' without
all that stoping, rewinding, playback stuff that you have to do
with a vcr..?  At least you get a clean picture.. unlike a
freeze frame on the vcr.

Geez Mike, sounds like a pretty sophisticated setup. I'm not familiar with
Comm-4. I'm getting a Disto 4in1 to hook to my SC-II. Right now I have a mpi
with Tandy Rs232pak. I'm just wondering what else I'll need besides the
hi speed modem. Now I'm going to ask what may be a really dumb question to
someone who knows about the internals of the coco. Once I mate the 4in1 to
my SC-II, can I still use that controller with a mpi? I'd like to so I could
maybe use one of the now freed mpi slots for a serial mouse, and/or parallel
printer(2nd). One last question, what does a Robotics sportster 14400 modem
go for($$). Thanx For getting back to me. Charlie

I would assume you could use the disto 4-in-1 in the MPI, but someone who
owns one could answer that for sure.

Well you have most of what you need. You will need to do some sort of IRQ hack
to the pak to get the speed, replace the clock module with a better one.
Nitros-9 is defintely a big help (i couldn't get 9600 baud without it)
Sportsster modems run for about $125 nowadays.

Yes i can run all 4 serial ports at the same time if i wish. it has a
circuit inside to avoid clashing IRQ's so all of them go through.
Its no longer made, but you can make a dual version by modifing another
rs232 pak to address differently, that will give you 2 ports.

I don't know how familiar you are with the 4 in 1, but it does not have
all of the hardware lines that you probably need for 9600 speed. There
are text files in the general database describing how to modify it. If
you need help with the 4 in 1, I run mine without a MPI and it does
great and it already has a parallel port built in.  Give me a call
and we can work on it.

     AD&D Magazine

        Hey everybody,


        I'm thinking about putting together a on-line role-playing magazine
centered around AD&D.  What I would like to do is collect submissions from
various people containing new spells, monsters, magical items, stories, etc.
similar to "Dragon" or "White Dwarf".  Is anybody interested??????

        The magazine would contain no actual programs so it could be used
by everyone of all types of computers although I would have to work up
some kind of format for each type as to make it easy to read (e.g. AmigaGuide
for Amigas, Hypercard for Macs etc.)

        Any types of articles or submissions complete and prefessional or
otherwise would be accepted (with some editing) and EMailed out to a bunch
of people.  (I would keep a list of subscribers Internet addresses).

        Price of the magazine would be 1 submission for a lifetime of
issues.   Almost everyone has a few extra creations lying around.

        If you are interested in such a venture, then leave me a message in
my mailbox.


        Internet address is   PutytheCat@Delphi.com

        Please state the words "Magazine info" as the subject.

     scsi in Burke and Burke with Scsisys10
     From: MDALENE      To: ALL

I have a weird question, I know I should ask Chris burke this but.... Since
he does not write scsisys and this also applies to that author here is my
question
    I found a great deal on a Maxtor 290MB 12ms SCSI HD. and a 8 bit scsi
card. I was going to buy it for my xt but.... I think Cecilia (My coco 3)
would make better use of it. I was going to install it externally so it
could plug into the card via the 25pin scsi external connector. First of all
does Scsisys allow a user to set the port address easily along with the slot
selection? B&B needs BOTH! and also... would the thing work The card I am
thinking of ordering uas a scsi driver you load from Disk. I deliberatly
said "NO" to the HD only version as it only allowd two HD devices and did
not even alllow Tape or CD-rom. (When I buy cards, I use device drivers,
just like on my Coco, I eat TPA (cp/m speak) but then upgrading is easier.
    Does Scsi sys 1.0 have a certain register demand? Does it nessarly need
a certain brand of Scsi chip? or if I had that info would the author prepare
me a version for testing? If it does not... I have a hungry Xt waiting...
but The case looks like it matches the coco 3 Much better. I was going to
lay out the Scsi HD to use 30 Meg partitions on the IBM. Give the old St-225
(20 MEG! Geez! Cecilia only fills hers half way full! and it is the same
size but newer Kalok 320!)
    Sorry this is so long but I really think that knowing this info could
give us with the B&B system a second chance to go SCSI. I want to use SCSI
as the MFM hardware is not easily found new and I do not want to have to
worry if the HD croaks and I got an old outdated interface that has no
support. I think Chris Burke did mention that if the card selected does not
use IRQ's it may work. I do not know if it does or not but My HD on my XT
does have an IRQ address and it works fine on my Coco 3.

            **  New software Announcement  **
          **   HOME-PAC OS  -  Home Manager **
     Developed by Terry Simons with over six years of upgrading
the RSDOS Version, this became a very powerful set of software.
     Basically it is a check program that turns into a home
accountant.  Suitable to keep books for personal, business, and
club activities.  A strong point thoroughout this package it's
personalization features.  Which makes many entries a one key
(macro) or default entry.  John Hoit (CoCo user gone to PC in '93)
said, "I have yet to find a program that inputs and handles data
with the ease of Home-Pac".
  With a mailer, that would will a from a Christmas card list to
publishers data base.  Many have stated it was unrivaled for CoCo
RSDOS Software of it's kind.
    Now under OS-9 Chris Dekker has incorprated still more
features.  And through the use of windows an increased processing
speed, "Home-Pac OS" now rivals anything avalaible on the CoCo.
 1. All programs menu enter tied.
 2. Handles two seperate accounts from one menu.
 2. Full 80 column displays, giving an over view.
 4. Creditcard & Check balances constant on screen.
 5. Generally does things with ease, taking the
    "work" out of "Bookwork".
 6. With an equally powerful Mailer.
 7. Plus "Disk Jacket" program to help you find your files fast.
 8. And "From-Maker" for shopping lists, Scorecards, etc.
 9. With INSTALL program no OS knowledge is needed.
          Sold for years as the best RSDOS can offer,
            now even better under OS-9.
    Requires COCO 3, 80 Column monitor, Drive, and OS Lev II.
       Outside MI&CC sold only by:   C Dekker Software,

      **    New Product  Announcement & Review **
   The CoCo Registry
        from Rick's Computer Enterprises
  The purpose: to give a central point of reference for all
those who want to be part of the CoCo Community.
   .
  In my mail today was a package from Rick's.  Opening it, I
discovered a bright colored flippie.  "The CoCo Registry", First
issue.
  I poped in in the drive and typed RUN"CR.   I always hafta see
if it's also ADOS compatible,,, sure nuff it is.   It comes on
screen with a template format, and says "one moment please".
Well, it should say "several moments please", because it loads
the entire data file for: Two Hundred and Sixty Two  CoCo'ists.
   Gosh Rick,, do you do all this in 128K?  May I first off say,
"my hats off Rick.  That's quite a piece of programming!"
  The template consists of various boxes or windows, displaying
a column of names, a window showing the highlited persons Name,
Address, Ph, etc another with an impressive list of Magazines
and Groups underlining which group/mag the person supports.
Another diplays sytem information of the supporter.  And still
another has a search/ print on various formats by your
direction.  Oh, yeah, it does come with printed Doc's.  But it's
so user friendly I didn't find a need for them.
  If you're asking how can you get all this on one screen?  You
can't, at 128 columns it's just too much.  But still you can
switch side to side with the arrow keys.  This leaves room for
overlap and still a convient very read for 128 columns.
  On the flipside (I did say it's a flippie, right) is a list of
advertisers, each giving a discount.
  If you're thinking this would be good for dealers only,,,
perhaps you're forgetting, there may well be a CoCo user living
around the corner from you in your own town?   Or several?
    First off: be a part of the CoCo Community.  To get on the
list is "free".  Send a SASE to:
  Rick's Computer Enterprise   P O Box 276   Lexington, KY 42539
     He'll send you the form.
  The purpose is to give a central point of reference for all
CoCo those who want to be part of the CoCo Community.
   This is bound to grow as Fests and clubs start up fuller in
the fall.  Their will be more issues.  The Cost?  Check with
Rick.  Like most things he offers,, it'll be a bargin.

     MM/1's Full Potential
     From: MREGC        To: ALL


    With the recent conversation online here about CD-i and the titles
available for it I've been thinking. As a programmer I have tapped the
limits of how much speed I can get out of a 68070 equipped MM/1 using C
to do full-screen scrolling while programming "by the rules". Yet when
I look at some of the titles available on CD-i that do full-screen
scrolling they do it several times faster, and I'm sure CD-i programmers
aren't programming in assembly.

    This leads me to 2 possible reasons for the performance difference,
(well, 3 reasons, but the most obvious, poor programming on my part, I've
ruled out since 2 other programmers whose opinion I value highly agree
that the code I'm using couldn't be done any more efficiently,) first, it
could be that CD-i programmers are using features of the 68070 that we
aren't, or second, the extra VSC chip that CD-i has is giving them extra
power to utilize.

    If option 1 is correct, then what are they getting out of the 68070
that we aren't? I must admit to being somewhat, if not completely ignorant
of the hardware abilities that lie outside of the normal range of
programming, but one thing that comes to mind is our DMA channels. Maybe
I'm off on what DMA really is, but, as I understand it, aren't we using 1
DMA channel for sound and the other for SCSI device access? Is it
possible for a programmer to change this setup in a program so that one
channel gets used for sound and the other gets used to speed up movement
of screen data to screen memory?

    If option 2 is correct, and the second VSC chip gives them more
programming power, then the 1 VSC we have should give us SOME extra
programming power. I know the VSC has a PIXAC, and its my understanding
that the only thing we're using it for is the mouse pointer. Can we get
access to the PIXAC from within C? Or would we have to program in
assembly? Since K-Windows is using it for the mouse pointer, would
accessing the PIXAC mess up K-Windows? Are there other VSC features that
we aren't using or don't have access to?

    Whether DMA or the PIXAC is the answer to the CD-i speed difference,
the reason for their underutilization on the MM/1 is tied directly to
K-Windows, and how Kevin decided to use them. As much as I love K-Windows
and regard Kevin Darling as a top-notch programmer, I don't think he
wrote K-Windows with optimizing graphics manipulation in mind, whereas CD-i
was designed with just that purpose in mind. Can we gain access to these
underutilized features of the MM/1 hardware without wreaking havoc on
K-Windows and remain "within the rules" of OS9?

    Are both of these options incorrect, and there's another reason for
the performance difference?

     CD-i Update
     From: PHXKEN       To: ALL

Following Boise thread, I paid a visit to my local Service Merchandise.
They see the newer Magnavox version of the CD-i machine.  The clerk said
that the video cartridge was not available for that machine and they
had no software for the cartridge.  Opposite story at Sears, no
Magnavox model and no reduction in price on the Phillips model.
Incredible Universe has the Phillips at $20 off and the video cartridge
and many many titles.  Needless to say, I am not pleased with
this marketing technique.  Now, I do not know if there is or is not
a video cartridge for the cheaper Magnavox unit.  Will keep looking.

     cc3disk
     From: SMITHBA      To: DBREEDING (NR)

You mentioned in a letter about a patch for cc3disk, so it will clear it's
interupt when it is done. I assume you are talking about the super controller
2 no halt drivers. that is exactly what I have been looking for. Could you tell
me exactly what the name of the file is, and what topic it's under.
also i'm looking for a patch to the kernal patch by bruce istead. it's
supposed to recognize up to two meg, but will only recognize one meg.
I had to use the original kernal, and I patched the old mega command.
any help would be appreciated.
