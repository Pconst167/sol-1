        >>Can stream backup a HD using more than one drive,

        Hi Denny. I recently did my first complete backup in a long time
   and used stream, but this time used only one drive. The last time I
   tried a two driveckup I ran into a problem, tho I can't remember
   exactly what it was<it could very likely have been my fault>. I don't
   remember if it was Stream I was using then, but am pretty sure you can
   use more than one drive. Try this:

        Stream <filelist -b -vl /dd/sys/stream/backlog /d0 /d1 /d2


        There is no guarrentee this is right, but I am PRETTY sure it
   will. Keep in mind he may want to do some of the stuff a little
   different, but just keep the last 3 parameters right<the drive names>.
   'filelist' is a list a make of all the files with the 'Files' command
   that comes with the hdkit package. I chd to the directory that that
   file resides in, the enter the '-b' command<for backup> which is
   really default anyway. The I enter the -v command so that it will also
   list the process to the screen as it goes along, and then the 'l' for
   'log', and the logfile is in /dd/sys/stream/backlog. That stuff he may
   want to change around to his liking if he knows enough

Its intended to be an alternate output for test runs for pf, so as not to
waste half the eastern USA's pulp capacity doing test prints. So It would
have all the output that normally goes to the printer shoved thru it. It
takes the shove with no errors, and the pathnum shows to 'paths', but it
finds a leaky pipe someplace, a 100% leak!  I think that several years ago
it worked, as that part of te code has been in pf since about version 12
or so. And I can do it from a basic09 test program just fine, or from any
one of a dozen or so utils, like saveing a screenfull from 'vu' to '/wp',
which works just fine.   I'm still puzzled, and have now rearranged that
code dozens of times over the last week trying to make it work. NADA, Zip,
nothin has beene the results so far. Heck, I can even use the > operator
which works just fine.  Thanks for the reply tho, Zack, nice to hear from

 I hope that outpath is defined as a FILE *.  'fopen()' returns a pointer to
 a typdef struct FILE defined in stdio.h not an int.  I'd be a little sus-

 First OS9 allocates variable storage from high memory but a pointer value of

Just to relay my CoCo 3 experiences - I was gradually adding on to
my system until Tandy shut things down and then 3rd party support
got scarce. I had reached the point where I had a KenTon SCSI interface
and 65 meg HD and was quite happy with the increased throughput thaily, the 6309
addressed that but my interest had largely passed by then to my MM1.
However, thinking about installing a 6309, getting the SCSI drivers
that support 512k sectors and speed up access, and using GuiB does
get my blood flowing again. I will probably get arounf to revving up
the old CoCo in the aforementioned manner, but I dont have any real
time frame for it. Currently, my CoCo is at my office and I use a
word processor (Window Writer) and a personal information manager
(DeskTamer) on it extensively.

My current systems are as follows:

Operational:

512k  Coco3  w/  Mpi  (unmodified),  RS232pak,  Zoom  2400bps modem, Owl HD
adapter, ST251 Hard Drive(40meg & full to capacity),  1.2meg  5.25  fllopy,
Disto SC1, (2) 360k 5.25 floppy, and a CM-8 monitor.

512k  Coco3  w/  FD502, (2) 360k 5.25 floppy, mouse w/hi-res adapter, and a
i s primarily for MAX10. It is
also the computer my daughter (13yrs) uses for homework  and  games.    The
Coco1  and  2  are mostly a nostalgia kick, although they do see occasional
use to run things like the old Appliance and Light  Controller  that  don't
run  on  the  Coco3.    The 128k Coco3 is a backup, a hedge against the day
when one or both of the others fail  and  parts  are  just  not  available.
From  that  last statement it may correctly be extrapolated that the Coco's
meet my current needs quite adequately and will continue to do so  for  the
forseeable  future.    Yes,  I  would  like  to  be  able  to handle larger
databases more easily and be able to get data from  Mess-Dos  to  OS9  more
easily,  but I do not find this a reason to go out and invest as heavily as
would be needed in a computer just to  have  compatability  with  Mess-Dos.
Although  a computer running OS9-68k seems to be the future of OS9, I can't
justify an investment in that direction just yet either.

As for soa exhaustive list of my software, it does cover those
programs used most frequently not counting utility commands.

        I get a feeling, this will be another long winded message of
   mine, so beware<grin>.


        I'm glad you brought this subject up Brother Jeremy, since not
   only is it very important for us in the 6809 world to come up with a
   sort of basic hardware 'guideline', it is also a very reachable
   goal<VERY reachable> if only the Coco users will speak up and give a
   little information, and voice themselves through the process, so no
   one or almost no one is upset later on when all is said and done. Wow,
   talk about a run on sentence! Anyhow if we get together, through
   conferencesn here and other services we could make way for a basic
   setup that programmers can use when writing programs. I agree OSK is
   the future, but there is no reason to stop using the Coco unless you
   need to move on. I think a lot of people are getting to caught up in
   the 'Coco is Dead' attitude, which seems to come from some people who
   have moved on and use OSK or another system exclusively. It is
   understandable how this can happen, since it obviously isn't being
   sold any more, but it is also important to remember this one question.
   Why NOT use,support and enjoy it? I say use it as if the market is
   growing and who knows what we may be able to do yet? Of course your
   not going to see a big surge of Coco's out there, but the people that
   ARE using them may become more involved, and who knows, we may even
   pull a few out of the closets! Remember, a lot of what is learned from
   the Coco can very easily be applied to the bigger, machines of the
   future :-) I tried too he UG, but for obvious reasons, that never came to be.

        Ok, to get my info out of the way, here is what I am running
   on...

        1. 512k Color Computer 3(6809), Upgraded MultiPak,Tandy RS232
   Pak, Tandy Fd-502 40 track DS drive with the Tandy (halt) controller
   which is used as /d0, a 720k 3 1/2" drive which I use as /d1, a
   Seagate 20 meg HD which Burke&Burke Coco XT-RTC, and an AMT Star 2400e
   modem

        I think the MultiPak or equivilent is such an obvious
   requirement, that it is almost silly to even include it. I don't think
   any hardware should be limited to one vendor's product. For instance I
   think a hard drive with interface should be standard<I use that word
   loosely in our case>, but all supported interfaces should be
   supported, not just B&B,Ken Ton,Disto, Etc.      Personally, while I
   don't own a NitrOS9 or PowerBoost package, I wouldn't be against most
   future devolpement being centered around the 6309 chip. For 1, there
   is alreadywll run on the 6809
   will be able to run on a 6809 Coco, tho a bit slower, unless of course
   it is assembler. That could present a problem. Well that's all I can
   offer off the top of my head at this time, but I'll also respond to a
   couple points you made.

        >>What software you would like to see. Obviously there are many
   of us in the 6809/os9 world who still want to see the Level 2 upgrade
   released. This is a mandatory project for the Users Group to
   undertake.

        True. There is no question getting the code will greatly increase
   the chances of people staying with the machine, rather than leaving it
   due to aggravation caused by the patching needed. A regularly updated
   version maintained by the User Group, most likely under the care of
   Zack Sessions, or whoever is the librarian at the time, will also help
   bring a few more users back, or even new users in, that were
   originally intimidated by the amount of hacking required. I know it
   sounds likeith OSK, but
   unfortunately OSK is still a little out of reach for many users, and
   the code, as well as SBF like you mentioned in your next point,
   presents a good alternative for those who can't upgrade, or are just
   comfortable with what they have. Personally I think the prices for the
   current machines are fine especially given the market we are trying to
   open, but a lot of people just don't have the money, no matter how
   well priced the machines are<especially the Sys IV and MM/1>.

        >>5. Certain RSDOS programs to be ported to 6809/OS9.

        Of course I'm sure you don't think Max-10 should be among
   those... ;-)
        I agree this should be considered, but it isn't quite as
   important as the level II code and SBF projects. I think it might be a
   little more important to  put more emphasis on getting NEW programs
   developed, as well as trying to get our hands on portable code from
   other systems<the Atari and Amiga shareware stuff immediately comes to
   mind>. The latter might end up not being doable but it can't hurt to
   try. I think the problem with RSDos is that most if not all the good
   stuff there is written in Assembler, which even if we get the rights
   to rewrite them, it will REWRITES, and not a port :-( If it can be
   done tho, I say why not!?
        Another goal should be getting in touch with vendors of
   yesteryear, and try to get a hold of some of the good programs that
   lost support. We should try and get them in the hands of a vendor who
   can sell it and support it commercially, and if that isn't possible
   see if it can be released to shareware, as another program added to
   the OS9 UG library. A big boost to the UG's shareware library could be
   helpfull in generating a some funds<this applies to both OSK and OS9
   actually>.
        Now the challenge of pulling through with this project is getting
   users from all over involved. Right now we are just the Delphi
   community. We also have the members of other online pay services, as
   well as the small isolated BBS's all over, plus Fidonet,STGNet,and
   Internet users. With a little effort and coordination, we can get all
   of them involved. The harder part is going to be getting the interest
   and involvement of the people without the benefit of a modem and/or a
   service to get on. One of the goals of the UG is to try and bridge
   this gap as much as possible, and one of the (pardon the pun ;-)
   blessings of this whole project is, it will probably provide the UG
   with it's first test to see if it can indeed make such communication
   possible. The only way to go is up, so I'm interested to see how this
   will work out :-)
        Let me know where you stand concerning my ramblings :-)

Yes, two, both from EFFO.  There is an earlier version (something like
6.1) available in the EFFO library here in the database.  That is probably
the one Paul emailed to you.

They also have a port of version 6.21, but it falls under EFFO's new
distribution policy, which requires ordering the disks from Switzerland,
and payment of a distribution fee.  Sorry, I don't have a complete address
handy.

What problems are you having?

What version of the Terminfo files are you using?  You should be using
the version from Trminf1a.lzh, which was posted to the database with
Rogue.  This has updated Terminfos for G-Windows.

Also, what version of G-Windows afwor things.  (See Ed Gresick's
post of the GW "edition.h" file, in the Database New area.)

Yes, so long as the termcap is fully supported.  I did not distribute the
tools for creating Terminfos because they were just too buggy for general
release.  I had to use several workarounds to coax them to work.

As noted previously, I am thinking of doing an updated port once I finish
my current projects.  This would use Termcap, and should be much faster.

Why does the 4-N-1 need 12V? Anything to do with the clock? Mine doesn't
keep the right time. Haven't tried the hard drive controller yet, but
expect to use it soon. Or does just the RS-232 use 12V?

An then, the RSDOS basic program did not seem to work for the
ST157N and larger drives.  I have a patched version of it
around somewhere.  Let me know if you need it.  I almost
forgot to mention that I do not use the multipak.  The
SC-II/4n1 and a Rs232 pack are on a ribbon cable.  You can,
if you are adventerous, bypass the on-board voltage regulator
on the SC-II and feed it 5v directly from the PC power supply.

I believe the 12 volts get regulated down to 5 volts with a
7805-type chip, the excess energy being dissapated as "heat"!
If you are putting it in a PC system, you can solder a wire
on the output of the regulator and take regulated +5 from
the PC power supply.  A ground (common) wire is a good
idea, too.

I have had trouble getting to the BBS but Wes is still operational.  Was on the
BBS in the evening only about a week ago at 604 - 589 - 1660
He has been using that line as a day business phone so try again.  Usually
you will at least get the answering machine.  If at first you don't succeed -

That the source code is available IS very interesting! After a C version
was running, it should be easier to convert that to M/L than to start with
M/L from scratch...

Yes, you are so right ... Thomas Kocourek (Atlanta area) is porting a lot
of things to OS9000 and the SIM09 is something he has shown interest in
of late.  He just finished porting AR to OS9000 and I am looking for LHA

Mark,
     I'm sure you are right, most of the programs we see in the OS-9 areas are
programs written by hackers and they assume that other "hackers" will use them.
This is a shame because that is one of the things that keeps the RS-DOS users
away from OS-9, the need to understand OS-9 at the command line level before
you can use it.  I was lucky.  I was given a configured system that had all the
utilities and patches in place when I took the plunge into OS-9.  I was able to
use a lot of programs only because they were already configured to work on my
system.  I am still learning how to do certain things under OS-9 but I have had
a lot of use from my system because somebody else set it all up.  It shouldn't
be that hard.  I had tried OS-9 many times before that bihte directory that the program will create, create your own
directory-you name a directory and if it doesn't exist the program will make
it for you, and exit.  Obviously if you exit then the program isn't installed.

Check out some of C. Dekkers programs for good install examples. He doesn't
sell source code with his programs, but the install programs work well.
He even has hard drive install programs, but some of the older OS-9 guys..
user time wise... don't like the idea. They want to see source code so they can
see what's going to happen first. All he does is creat a directory and install
the program though. You still have to edit your boot file if you want anything
to autostart or an
ything. Chris will be at the Chicago fest... write him and see if he'll give a
talk on writing user friendly install procedures forS-9!!

I wrote installation programs for all of my CoCo based products. So far
all the MM/1 stuff only needed to dsave everything to CMDS and that's
it, so I didn't write an installation program for it. Besides, most
MM/1 owners are also developers who know how to install a few program
binaries.

But, yes, I agree with the concept and plan to have install programs for
any other product which is more complex to install.

Microsoft Visual C++ has a special facility which makes it easy to package
up your Visual C++ based project as a "standard MS-Windows installation"
style program. generates a program called SETUP.EXE, of course. :-)
