   I do not claim to know all there is to know (technically or otherwise
about the "Clipper Chip" or file encryption in general.  All I can say is that
I do not like what this government is doing, (real or implied).  It just
seems to me that it is taking (away) too much and not giving in return.  In my
opinion, banning the export of file     encryption programs and forcing ALL devi
ces
to contain the "Clipper Chip" is not in my best interest.  In my opinion, the
government has this attitude that they DO NOT need a "warrant" to "wire tap"
or otherwise SPY on its citizens. PGP was not exported to other countries.
Phil Zimmerman U/Led it to a BBS and it snowballed from there.
In MY opinion...
   I feel that WE THE PEOPLE should have the right to maintain privacy in
anything we do not want the general public (or government) to know.  By the
Constitution,  we have the right to FREE SPEECH which is what I am exercising
in this message.  If I do not want this message to be general knowledge, I
should be allowed to employ any means at my disposal to keep it that way and
not be subjected to the scrutiny of ANY government just because they might

In the case of the Clipper, you would still have the option of using a
different type of software encryption just as you do now. Most people would
use the hardware clipper routine simply because it is convenient and faster.
ALL data would'nt be encrypted either. So you aren't being FORCED to use
the Clipper technology...
It is really a waste of government money, as the drug dealers would use
different
 shcemes anyway to protect their records. I guess the gov't figures they can
throw  a charge at them for using something else???
I was just adding some facts. It's really nothing to be alarmed at, like the
wait for a security check before being allowed to buy a handgun. No real harm
in that... but criminals won't be buying through legitimate means anyway, and
thoes who go crazy and suddenly shoot lots of people usually already have the
gun, they don't go buy the day they start shooting! Legislation like this is of
little real value, but it seems to appease a large percentage of the population
who can't seem to
see anything but one way. I guess they feel they accomplished SOMETHING in
initiating such near useless legislation. The best GUN CONTROL law occurred in
a small town outside of Atlanta. Every male head of household was REQUIRED to
own somw type of firearm
! Guess what? Crime rate plunged overnight! Who wants to burglarize a
neighborhood where you KNOW 100% there is a gun owner in there?

Right.  I don't think this is a really big deal all by itself,
just like some well-intentioned lawmakers trying to ban certain
types of guns, "no-knock" searches, and a bunch of cops in
California who got tried twice for the same charge (yeah, they
should have been found guilty the first time, but they were not,
and that should have been the end of it).

None of these things really affect my personal life much, they are
just examples of little "nibbles" at the basic rights that I was
taught were mine forever.

I don't know about that town but I remember when Florida enacted what appeared
to be a an easier gun control law.  Just about anybody could get one as
opposed to the way it was before.  The media was predicting a blood-bath.
So far, I have heard of no blood-bath in Florida due to this easing of gun
control.  Hmmmmmm...........  BTW, in NJ "they" want to ban junkyards to accept
cars from pre-81 to reduce pollution from the clunkers and tax every radio
transmitter over 5 watts because of RF pollution.  As one trooper put it,
"They don't want gun control, they want people control."  This could be
applied to just about any kind of "control".

I don't recall the town now, sorry! It was on the news here sometime about

who had trouble firing the .38s and 9mms the police were letting some shoot.

I'm a member of two old car clubs. We have proven pretty much that such
legislation is utterly useless! If an old car is kept up, it produces no more
polution than a newer car in most cases. A two year old car with 150,000 miles
and needing a ring job does more damage than my 63 Rambler with a new engine.
One club member sent copies of the Mass. inspection reports for his 76 Pacer
and 88 Mini-Van (Chrysler V-6) to his rep. The Pacer was way under the
allowable standards while the van barely passed! The van had about 30,000
miles on it, the Pacer over 100,000! The Pacer had a head job (valve grind
and new seals) at around 80,000 miles, that was all.. still original

Patch09 is a "joint product" of FARNA and Conect. I had the idea, and asked
Rick for some help in compiling the best patches/utilities. He added the
auto-patch routine himself. We both market it for about the same price!
I sell the disk set alone for $7.50 + $2.50 S&H (per order), while Rick sells
for $3.50 + $4.00 S&H. If all you want is the disk set, you get a better deal
from Rick. BUT.... if you want the "OS-9 Quick Reference Guide" along with
the disks from me, the disk price is only $5. The QRG is $7.50, you get both
for $12.50. Most people who have the QRG say it is very helpful and they
rarely pull the manuals off the shelf now. I also have one for OSK now at
$8.50 (+ $2.50 S&H per order). It is virtually the same, but 60 pages versus

Inkjets also have one drawback- they are more expensive on a per page
consumable cost than even laser printers. Many people assume Lasers to be high,
but the consumable cost is actually among the lowest of any printer.... about
2-3 cents a page. Dot matrix
 runs around 4-5 cents, and ink jets around 6-7 cents. This is assuming new
cartridges/ribbons, not refills, which would bring costdown to dot-matrix on
the ink jets, I think.  They aren't very fast either, most run around 2ppm or
140 or less CPI.

John,

I find my HP Deskjet 500 far faster than my old 9-pin dot matrix from
Rat Shack, and I refill my ink cartridge with Shaffer "Skrip" ink for
about $2 a bottle!  I can refill my cartridge between 4 or 5 times
with one bottle of ink.  That brings my cost per page down lower
than buying or re-inking those ribbons from Rat Shack and, I would
guess, lower than a laser printer.

Traditionally, an ink-jet costa about 7 cents per page (give or take a cent)
in consummables IF all new consumables are used. Refilling definately takes

Wow, Terry, you go back.  The slowest transmission speed I ever saw was
300 baud on the old Model 15 Teletype page printers!  You are correct,
though, I never saw anything slower than a Rat Shack 9-pin.  The HP not
only runs at 9600 baud compared to 2400 for the dot matrix, but also
prints in both directions with 360 x 300 dpi resolution at (I forget)
how many pages per minute.  It has 3 resident fonts, portrait and
landscape printing plus 10, 17 and 20 cpi selectable from the panel.
It also has an envelope feeder and 15 manually selectable character
sets.  (Max speed is 19,200 baud, not 9600 mentioned above.)  Using
the Epson FX-80 emulator, it exactly reproduces Max-10 output with
the Epson FX-80 driver that comes with Max-10.  (Max-10 resolution is
72 dpi as it always was.)  It is possible to get the printer to do
just about anything using the HP PCL language commands sent from
basic or OS-9.  I paid over $400 for mine, but saw them advertised
today for $269!!

     "Are you implying that a b/w ink jet is as inexpensive
      as a 24 pin?"

What gave you that idea? I *was*, however, pointing out that that
your statement:

          "All the ink jets seem to be priced over $400."

..did not reflect the reality of the marketplace. I am aware that
there a 24-pin dot matrix printers that sell new for less then the
least expensive ink jet (which currently appears to be the Epson
Stylus 300, which I have seen selling for around $230 from some
sources).

I do feel that anyone in the market for a new low end printer would
be much more likely to be satisfied with an ink jet than a 24-pin
impact printer, unless they simply could not afford the small cost
differential. (Assuming the 24-pin model they were considering *was*
actually one that was less expensive than an ink jet).

24-pin printers are better for some uses (i.e., I would not recommend
an inkjet for long listings, as the vast majority have no tractor
feed option of any kind...the Canon BJ-300 and 330 being two exceptions),
just as I would recommend a 9-pin printer over a 24-pin in certain
situations. (They key in that case being the durability of the printhead
pins moreso than the slight cost savings).

As I recall, this discussion originally stemmed from someone looking
for a printer, who had no need of color, and primarily was concerned
with text output. For that, I still stand by my recommendation of an
inkjet over a 24-pin dot matrix.

Hey Bill, is that the original type cartridge or the new
51626 "high capacity" one?  If you are refilling the new
one, where did you drill the hole?  I have seen ads for
new type cartridges modified so they can be refilled, but

You know, you're absolutely right! It can only read DECB disks at this time,
and I have no idea if they have any plans on adding OS9 support. I suppose
then, for OS-9 you'd also have to have the RSDos utility to transfer the OS-9
file to a DECB formatted disk first, then take that to the PC with Elite*Xfer.

I talked to Elite*Software recently and Elite*Xfer only works with
RS-DOS disks.  They don't even sell or support any software for OS-9.
They are now an MS-DOS company but still sell the old Elite* RS-DOS
stuff at about 75% of their original costs.  I would have loved to
see an OS-9 Level 2 copy of Elite*Word, but they never supported
OS-9.  They did release an OS-9 Level 1 version of Elite*Word but
it was buggy and unreliable, I actually own a copy!

        Actually there are quite a few options for OS9. Gale Force sells
   Sdisk which comes with tools to read/write Dos disks<as well as
   RSdos>, and he also sells MSF<?> which I think it is called. It is a
   MSdos file manager you can add to the boot to make it real easy to
   read/write to dos disks. It is available for people using Sdisk.

Terry, if you are going to stick with the CoCo, OS-9 could come in real handy,
and you'll find that the Coco has a lot of new tricks and life left in it!
I use van der Poel's OS-9 Mail List now... it handles large and small files
just fine. Definately don't want to have to switch everything over! If I were
having problems I would consider it though.

The business pak may do BETTER on OS-9 than DECB. Depends on the software
mix. Remember, such a pak can be used in a multi-user environment under OS-9,
allowing several people access to the same data. You could have one terminal
churning out labels while someone else on another label is printing a selected
few
of the labels, another is doing a mail-merge, etc.... all accessing the SAME
label database!

That's very true, though it will take some additional work to make sure

I never tried to compile a version of the DVI-ESC/P2
program on the COCO, but it might work.  If I remember
right, all the printer control sequences are defined
as macros in a separate header file - so even if it
comes out boo big for the COCO, it might be handy
as a starting point for someone to write a COCO driver
for the ESC/P2 printers.  As you pointed out, getting
a way to produce the DVI files on a COCO would be
quite a trick.

Some of the source code is available to StG sysops.  But this is for future
CoCo development (to fix current bugs and enhance current modules), not for
cross platform developemnet.  StG version 4 will be released for OS-9000 as

the CoCo according to Scott G.

Mike,
     I am sorry if there was any confusion with my statement. What I
meant is that DD must be defined as a floppy drive with some modified
versions of cc3go(or init) in order to boot on a floppy system
with no hard drive. If DD is defined as a hard drive the boot
process will look for shell, grfdrv and startup from the hard drive.
This will cause a system without a hard drive to fail in the boot
process. I realize that DD can and probably should
be defined as the hard drive if you intend on booting to a system
where the hard drive is the primary drive.
            Thanks for replying, I hope this is of use.

Its been too long since I ran across this to give ya the correct answer
off the top of my head but I can run it down. The KenTon SCSI system
changes some modules in your boot file beyond just adding an h0
descriptor and a driver for that HD. You could compare module idents
on your original (pre-KenTon) bootdisk and the KenTon boot and find it.
Obviously its a module that handles IO but I cant remember which and
my CoCo is at my office. I'm thinking cc3go now is the culprit. You
need the pre-KenTon version of cc3go (?) back in the boot your building
for your son.

Yes, the ASCII upload in the Level 2 version of OSTerm does not work:
from looking at the source, it appears that Vaughn probably added it
to the menu while he was working on it, but released the package before
finishing the code (and forgot to remove it from the menu).  The ASCII
upload isn't broken because of a problem with the code; it simply
doesn't work because it was never finished!  This also applies to the
MM/1 release of TasCOM.

Northern Xposure has licenced the code for development of an enhanced
version of OSTerm (OSK only).  The "prompted ASCII uploading" is fully
functional in the current development version of OSTerm 68K.

Sorry, there are no plans for releasing an enhanced 6809 version, BTW.

 One.  There isn't enough energy available to accelerate a body with a non
 zero rest mass to light speed.  Not even if you were to convert the entire
 mass of the universe to energy.

 Two.  No matter what your velocity is relative to another body, the speed of
 light is a constant in both frames of reference.  When you did switch on
 your headlights, the beams would leave your car at the speed of light.
 Abberation would cause your view of the road ahead to be 'interesting'.
 But! the visible light photons reflected from "stationary" objects (which
 are moving at near light speed in YOUR frame of reference) would strike you
 with energies way up in the gamma range so you'd probably not live long
 enough to enjoy the view.

 You would, of course, replace "sc23d8" with whatever your supercomm file

   I have a question that you might know something about. When you alter
your bootfile with native Pboost, do you change REL and OS9p1? If so,
then that explains why I can't boot from HD anymore. I have a 65meg,
RGB-DOS system with scsi interface like Neal discribed. I used the RGB
mods that came with the system to make a boot but it won't boot from
the HD anymore. My problem is the opposite of Neal's troubles. Mine
starts from HD, but it quickly switches to /d0 to load. I can live with it
but I'd like to know how come this happens. Thanx again for your help.

Charlie,

   yep, PBoost modifies OS9P1, REL, and Boot. Your problem is most likely the
boot module; you're back to one that looks at the floppy. I do not know if
the RGB boot module will work under native unmodified or not. The old try it

If you say so Paul. I'm just following the manual (Rainbow). I suppose
I'll get it down sooner or later. The good news is I have my startup
configured to load SC, Dynastar, Presto Partner, along with term and one
text window. It even puts the PAGAN logo (altered a little) on the term
screen. Of course, with only 512k, I don't have much memory left. But
then I'm going to the Fest so I'll maybe fix that. I even have enuf
system memory to format a disk. I started late learning but I'm picking
up something new everyday. I might even be happy now for a week before
I try to alter things again. NO! A week is too long...maybe two days.
I didn't know what you meant by 'initializing all those windows'. Till
now I never had to deal with it. Willfo sent me his 'make#' utils for
creating windows several years ago when I started trying to get into
OS9. I couldn't use that for loading SC and Dynastar. So now I can
make my own with a little trail and error. Thanx for the tipoff, you

Paul is absolutely correct. Do not iniz windows unless it's absolutely
needed, such as for wcreate (I don;t use wcreate for this reason). In the
old Level 1 days, it was a good idea to iniz all devices to be used, due to
memory frag reasons. With Level 2, this reason is gone, and the "W" descriptor
makes inizing unwanted. "W" is not a window device. It is a psuedo device that
tells the system to find the next unused (un-inized) window device, and use
that. If all the windows are pre-inized, it will bomb out.

 In the case of something like:
   iniz /w
   wcreate /w etc etc etc
   shell i=/w&

 The system will find an uninized window to use with the first line, which inizs

it. Then, for the second line, it will have to find another unused window. Can't

use the first one... it's now inized. Same thing for the third line. The system
seeks out a new window for the shell to use, which won't be either of the first
two.

on equipment and software.  Perhaps those that post classifieds could also
post a classified when equipment/software is sold.  There must be a better
way than to let other users chase empty leads because something has been sold.

Thanx again,
                Dave

I seem to run up against the barn doors swinging quite often.  I check out
the most recent classifieds and work my way back to about three months back
if the classifieds are sparse.  I agree with you.  We need better maintainence
of the classfieds and the people placing them need to take greater
responsibility for them.  They need to tell us when an item or items are
sold by the same means as they used to sell them, rather than leave us to
pay on a "dead horse".  Anyway sounds like we're on the same sheet of music
as they say.  Take care, and I appreciate your response.

     Printer baud rate
     From: ISC          To: ALL

My printer works well at 9600 baud from the bit banger port.  Why won't it
work at 19,200?  Port speed?  I get an error 203 - illegal mode.

Dumb question?

Unfortunately, I won't be going to CocoFest in Chicago, but it is good
to hear from you.  I do have on brief ?? for you however. Quite a while
ago I bought one of the early 1 Meg setups.  It still works, and I have
put a lot of my patches on Delphi.  I heard about a 2 meg setup you
built using SIMMs.  Are any of these still around and will they work
with the original 1 Meg address board.  I remember that the original
1 Meg could be piggy backed into 4 layers of 512K to give 2 M and the
additional line was even provided on the original address board.

Thanks, and good luck on your trip...

     Disto 4n1 clock driver
     From: NEATKID      To: ALL

I wonder if somebody can help me out here...

    About a year ago I bought a Disto SC-2 with the 4n1 board. The problem
is that the guy I bought it from neglected to send me the OS9 drivers for the
4n1 board.  I did find a clock driver, but NitrOS9 won't patch it. This is
the clock driver that is IRQ hacked, and I beleive in the database here.

    At any rate, does someone have the original Disto driver, or know of
a patch to the IRQ hacked drivers? My system is set up for slot 4, 60 hz,
for the 4-n-1 board.

    Thanks,
     Nick

I have the  drivers to most of the Disto hardware.  If you can get Tony
D. [DISTO] to grant me permission to send the drivers to you I will.
However, it is up to you to contact Tony and have him send me a message
allowing me to do so.

Howdy, I'm Gene Heskett, and I just uploaded the exact native mode clock
you need. At the moment its the 2nd or 3rd item down in "dat new". You
won't need to patch it as its already been "Nitros-9'd". It should also
work with the pboosted systems, but its time getter IS specific to the
SC-II+4n1 clock in slot 4. Slot patch instructs remain the same tho, so
you can use it in any slot or no slot (no mpi). Cheers, Nick

     keyboard
     From: LARRYOLSON   To: MROWEN01

Mike,
   I got the keyboard tonight. I work nights but it was in the mail box
when I got home at 12:30.
   I've got it all remapped for you, but it is now 4:07 am, so I want to
wait till tomorrow night and check it completely for any errors.
   I also forgot to ask you what you wanted done with the CAPS key.
   I can remap it to parallel any other key. I might suggest remapping it
to parallel the ALT key. As you know, the 4/p didn't have an ALT key, so
I mapped the F3 key as the ALT key. The only problem with using the F3 key
is that it is way over at the top right of the keyboard while the CAPS key
is closer to the middle.
   Another option is that since line 8 on the connector is not being used
now, this line could be connected to the CAPS key, with the other side of
the CAPS switch going to ground. This could be used to control whatever
you would like.

  Larry
