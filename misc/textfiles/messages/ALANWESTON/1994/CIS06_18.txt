Hi Steve,
I made some projects like yours under OS-9 using the GUI called MGR, which is
well supported by first, seccond and thrird parties.
OS-9 is well known in the "industrial I/O area" and several drivers are
available. Since there is the GNU-C-Compiler as ANSI and C++ version available,
there is the wide range of UNIX-Sources available for OS-9.

Ciao Martin

Has anyone considered developing for CompuServe's HMI (host micro interface) to

Boisy,

I've been in contact with them off and on for a couple of years.  The problem
is that they will not release specs for the HMI interface itself, and they will
not release sample source code, they will only release a compiled library of
functions for the mainstream DOS, Windows or Mac development platforms.  Maybe
Microware can do something about getting OSK libraries? I didn't get anywhere
with it, and neither have others like Amiga and Atari developers, and they've
tried a lot harder than I ever did.  I was looking at it strictly as a way to
make InfoXpress less prone to line noise, or changes in menus, but decided that
the effort to implement HMI was more than I really wanted to tackle (not to
mention CIS's disinterest in supporting a non standard platform).  If it was
available, I'd look into using it, and I'd be happy to add my support, as a
developer, for an OSK library. Please keep me posted.

I have long suspected that the popularity of all the fancy graphics and

people to read.

Perhaps the person at Compuserve in charge of releasing those specs is a recent

Fm: Mike Fahy 74656,2340
To: All

This might get a little long winded and the subject will bear a
narrow band of interest, but I'm going to iterate my experience
installing a SCSI Hard Drive on a Coco III and see if I can get any
comments or constructive advice.

Hard Drive: Seagate ST138N - 30 MB RLL - Verified good on a PC.

Controller: Disto HDII piggybacked on a Disto Super Controller II.

Drivers: SCSI package from Matt Thompson, freeware & registered versions.

I started Friday afternoon using the registered version of the
software which adds caching, turbo, and a few other things to the
freeware version.

Throughout the documentation, it is quite emphatically stated that to
use 512 byte sectors, the actual sectors per track should be
multiplied by two when creating a device descriptor.  This was done.
Parameters used were 613 Heads, 4 cylinders, and 52 (26x2) SPT.

The low level and verify pass, which ignore the driver & descriptor,
correctly indicated a hex number which came out to about 64,000
sectors which would be 32 MB (64000*512).

Next an appropriate boot diskette was Os9gen'd containing H0 and
SCSISYS drivers.  When the High level format was started, it looked
at the descriptor and indicated a hex number of twice the number of
sectors which would tell the formatter to format a 64 MB drive.

I let it run, assuming the documentation was correct and, not
surprisingly, the drive commenced a lot of head banging halfway
through the format process.

I proceeded to twidle parameters, including backing down to 26
sectors per track.  This resulted in a sucessful completion of the
formatting but the drive was unreadable.

All this takes a huge amount of time, since a new boot disk must be
gen'd every time paramteres are changed.

Finally I went to bed.  Saturday morning I woke up with the bright
idea that if I double the sectors per track I should reduce the
cylinder count in half.

I did this and the high level formatting went without a hitch, but I
couldn't write anything legible to the drive.

After a third cup of coffee and a stroll around the house, I
resurrected my copy of the freeware version which doesn't have all
the caching and other speedups in it.

First I tried the descriptor creation according to the docs.  Double
the SPT and leave the actual cylinder count.  Same thing as the night
before . . head banging when it got to the end as if it was only half
finished.

Reduce the cylinder count in half, and all went beautifully.
Formatted 64,000, 512 byte, sectors giving me 32 megs.  I created the
necessary directories on the hard drive (Shell and Grfdrv in Cmds of
course, plus a DD descriptor in OS9boot on the floppy pointing to H0)
and the machine now starts the boot from the floppy, finishes from
the hard, including the commands in Startup on the hard.

Copied the rest of the operating system on the Hard Drive and I am
now running a three user system with both terminals (a PC and an old
Model III) defaulting to H0.

Picking up the pieces:

Couldn't use the registered version of Thompson's SCSI with a Disto HDII.

Contrary to the docs, I had to reduce the cylinder count if I
increased the SPT.

If anyone has waded this far through this message, I would love to
hear comments . .

Thanks, Ken.  I tried voice contact with Matt (according to the
docs) but all I got was an operator's recording unable to
complete the call.

The system as it now stands isn't half bad at all.  I found a
few patches to take care of interrupts and am overall quite
pleased.  The combination of SCSI & 512 byte sectors plus the
capabilities of the 6809 gives me performance far superior to my
older PC's and their MFM drives.  That isn't bias, it's simple
truth.

Be interesting to see how it works with Caching & Turbo in the
reg. version.  Hope something happens before I get the disk
filled up <g>.

The Disto arrangement is nice.  Pleasure to get rid of that
multipak.  Too much space for 4 lousy buss slots.

Now, if I could figure a way to attach an Ethernet board . .

Mike,

Thanks for describing your experiences with SCSI on the CoCo3.  I'm about to
embark on that journey myself :-).  I have a Disto HDI, which may be fried (my
10M SASI system quit working about a month ago, and my CoCo has been down since
then) and a KenTon interface without a cable, so I haven't quite got all the
pieces together yet.  I'm going to use the ST157N I took out of my MM/1.  I'd
be interested in any response that you might get from Northern Xposure about
all this.

Does anyone know where I can get either a Disto HDI or a cable for a KenTon
SCSI interface?

Bill:

Making a Kenton cable is easy.  You need a 50 pin connector and a 34 pin
connector, as well as a strip of 34 conductor ribbon cable.  connect the 34 pin
card edge connector to one end of the ribbon cable.  At the other end, make a
split right in the middle of the cable, so that on one strip you have 17 wires,
and 17 on the other.  attach the cable onto the far left and right sides of the
connector, leaving 16 pins in the middle with no cable.  Be sure to take pin 1
into account.

This agrees with the address given for Ken-Ton in the Vendors' section of the

Hey, gang, I have something I can't figure out.  I have an OSK machine- a
System 5, and have been attempting to use "rz", from a shell started under
Sterm.  I first attempted to d/l from my local BBS, and would get Timeout
errors.  I could use "rz" under my coco on this BBS.  The timeouts would come
rapidly, one every second, maybe.  All it would do was get the header and the
timeouts would begin.

Thinking it might be some quirk with the BBS I tried to dl from Delphi.  Here I
could get the file but would get a tremendous amt of Timeouts, and other
errors, even with error correction.

Now, my setup is a 2400 baud modem (Hayes Optima).  /t2 was set at 9600 baud.
On a hunch, I dropped /t2 back to 4800 and went to Delphi, good error-free d/l.
Went to the BBS and a good d/l.

Now I wonder why?  Does it have to do with the modem? Does this mean that "rz"
wouldn't work with a 14.4K modem at high speed?  Is the timeout being garbled
here or what?  Although not documented, I tried a "-t <timeout>" option on the
command line, but though seemingly changing the timeout time, it still didn't
help on the errors.

David,

Its possible that the modem isn't quite capable of communicating with your
system at 9600.  It could also be a flow control problem, although if you're
only connecting at 2400, I don't know why 4800 would work better than 9600.
How are the modem and port configured for flow control? How big is the input
buffer on /t2? I have mine set to 2048 on my MM/1.

I need to pack a configured vs. 3.0 system with user software on a set of 3"
floppies, for manufacturing build.  Anyone have any good ideas? It took a
consultant several weeks of hard labor the last time it was done, most of the
time spent reading a newspaper while waiting for a floppy to get written.

I'll provide some tips on dealing with events, signals and pipes in exchange.
Have learned a lot about the OS9 quirks, of which there are many.

Hi Steve,
there seem to be no GUI-support under psos+, neither client nor server.
psos+ development enviroment seems to need a specialist when beeing installed
(I'm only experienced on PC-based development systems).

Ciao Martin

Pete,

I've ported a couple of things from OSK to OS9000, and it looks like MicroWare
went out of their way to provide compatability between the two. Just about all,
if not all, of the OSK library calls are provided, even though the underlying
system is much more complex. I haven't had any free time lately to play much
with OS9000, but I'm impressed.
