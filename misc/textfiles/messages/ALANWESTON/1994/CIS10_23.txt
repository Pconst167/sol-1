Surely there is a LEN function in BASIC09?!?!?

Zack,

Yes, but it doesn't return the defined length of the variable, just the current
length. And it only works on strings, but then depending on how this is being
used, it should be fairly obvious what the size of non string variables is.

Finding the DIM'd length was exactly my concern.  Few things create a flake
problem faster than OCCASIONALLY overruning a string variables assigned
length...

Perhaps you could use the SIZE(str) function.  This returns the DIM'ed size of
the string you are querying.

Bob,

You are correct, but the only examples I've ever seen are in the C manual! Some
good examples, though, of how to use C subroutines with Basci09.  And since the
Basci09 calling convention is a little odd, interfacing with C requires some
#asm directives to set things up correctly, providing some clues on how to
interface with asm directly.

Thanks.  I'll file this away; my search for manuals has been interrupted by

Hi all,

I just purchased a TEAC FD-55GFR 1.2MB 5.25" floppy drive for my
MM/1.  I cannot seem to read CoCo OS-9 formatted disks with the
following dmode parameters:

name=c1
 drv=1 stp=3 typ=$24 dns=$01 cyl=40 sid=2 vfy=1 (off) sct=18 t0s=18
 sas=8 ilv=3 tfm=0 toffs=0 soffs=1 ssize=256 cntl=$0000 trys=0 lun=0
 wpc=0 rwr=0 park=0 lsnoffs=0 totcyls=80 ctrlrid=0 rates=$10
 scsiopt=$0000 maxcount=65535

When I attempt to read, I get an error #247.  The light comes on and
the drive is apparently trying to read the disk.

I recall hearing discussion that some 5.25" drives use a different
spin rate to read hi-density while others use a different data rate.
While I'm not trying to read a hi-density disk in this case, I wonder
if this drive will work as a 1.2 meg floppy?

Does anyone have any experience with this drive on the MM/1?  I would
appreciate any answers.  If I can't use the drive, I'm taking it back.

Right.  VDGInt can run hi-res screens, but no "versie-visa" <G>

And how.  I file 13'ed config pretty quickly..  I guess something like could
have been developed for those who would have been strictly in the "User" class,
but this one lacked a lot.  I simply set up various bootfil various
configurations and kept them on file.. I'd think this was what almost everyone
did.

    Unfortunately I can't answer your question, but I'm also currently trying
to gain access to the VSC's unsupported features, namely the PIXAC. I've also
been thinking of some things to use the RLE decoding for. If you have any
success at this let me know.
