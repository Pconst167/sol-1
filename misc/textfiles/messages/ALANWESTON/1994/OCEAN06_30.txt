Warren,
     I am using /t3 on an MM/1, setup for hardware handshaking, driving
a LineLink 144e modem.
 The dial options are:
   3. baud         2400
   4. word         8
   5 parity        none
   6. stop         1
   7. term type    ansi
   wait time       50
   9. 7-bit/cis-b  off
   0. auto macro   off
 
 The Modem options are:
  1. baud     2400
  2. parity    none
  3. word       8
  4. stop       1
  5. flow cntl   rts/cts
  6. rate adj.   locked
 
   Is there anything you can see that would cause the baud rate (or
maybe parity or stop bits), to change after the completion of an Xmodem
download ?

Larry,
    Main thing I can see is why are you using your hi-speed modem at
2400 baud ?  It is not necessary unless you are experimenting.  If it
is a good hi-speed modem you can lock baud at 38,400 from your MM/1 port 
/t3 and set your term program for hardware handshaking and let the modem 
do  the autobaud detecting when it connects to the callee.

Thanks, James.  I'll be talking to Al Huffman soon to see what progress
is being made on planning.

Hiya!  The electric company did me in for a bit this morning--there was
enough of a glitch that my system froze.  I rebooted, dchecked the hard
drive, and, as things seemed OK, went on my merry way, until I thought
to use the mouse.  It didn't respond.
 
I powered down, waited a bit, then rebooted.  Same thing.  Powered down, 
checked cables, powered back up.  Still not responding.  I thought dark
thoughts about the electric company and contemplated the cost of a UPS,
and resigned myself to bringing home another mouse the next day and
deciding whether it was the mouse, the paddleboard, or the serial chip
that was the problem.  Then I powered down and headed for lunch.
 
Later, I came back, and decided to check a BBS or two.  Brought my MM/1a 
up, and *ZOT!*, there was the mouse pointer again, as if nothing had
happened.
 
Now, I can see a power glitch frying a chip, or something of that sort,
but taking something out *temporarily*?!  Now, as far as I can tell, my
MM/1a is perfectly happy.  Does anyone out there have an idea about what 
might have caused such symptoms?  I'm puzzled.

Larry,
     According to my log you managed to get logged on at 9600 baud with
no modem error control.  However you did not leave me any more info on
how it was working (Osterm).
     In the graphic window of the new Osterm you can select the hardware 
handshake, or flow control, (rts/cts) and I am assuming this is what you 
had set.  However you need to check your Linelink modem manual to see it
this is the default.  You need to have your term program and modem cmds
both agree.  According to my log you did not have any modem error
control set, you can use the V.42b as that works well,  at least on my
ZyXEL.
     When you are using /T3 you can moded the port for larger in/out
buffer but I forget what to set to.  Maybe someone else (John A
Donaldson)  will give you that info. Additionally you can set your Hard
Drives maxcount to something like 4-6k instead of the 65535 but I have
not found that necessary with my Quantum HD. I believe Osterm allows you 
to set an modem init string or you can just use ATZ if the default modem 
cmds are OK.  I found my ZyXEL will work fine with the defaults when
calling out with either Osterm or Kterm.  As I mentioned before when you 
make up an autodialer macro you can use 38,400 as the baud rate if your
modem defaults to DCE/DTE locked rate set by the terminal (your term
program).  I just checked my moded of T3 and the input buffer is set to
4096 and output buffer 2048.
     I help this helps, sorry I did not leave more info the first time
but I was strapped for time and was expecting you to call voice on
Sunday morn.

Warren, this message is to advise you that I've sent you mail from my
new local connection to FIDO tonight.  According to the list given my
local sysop, there has been no mail on this Echo since February! 
So, someone along the line is not sending the Echo out, or something.
 
Just wanted you to be looking for another test message from me soon! 
 
Thanks!!!

David,
    No the echo is not dead.  Maybe the echolist is out of date.  Every
6 months the moderator, me, has to send an update.

Yeah! Another "ME TOO!". Hell, Dallas is part of the South isn't it! I sure 
hope they hold it at J.R.'s house!

Thanks, Warren.  BTW - just after we got FidoNet going, we received a
new version of the WildCat software that does not use the same message
base format.  Therefore, I am temporarily back to calling Ocean Beach
LOONNNG distance to get the echoes.  Sierra Hotel will be back on Fido
et ASAP.  Thanks again....
