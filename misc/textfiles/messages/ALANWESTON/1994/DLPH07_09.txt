     MM/1 Teac FD55FGR setup??
     From: NIMITZ       To: ALL

Can anyone give me information regarding software and hardware setup of
and FD55FGR floppy?  I need to set this up to read 360K CoCo diskettes on
an MM/1 I want to ship in the am tomorrow.  I do have the drive working,
and setup as drive 1.  But I can't get it to format a 360K diskette, or read
one.

I would rather set the drive to spin at 300 rpm, than adjust the CPU
board settings.  Thanks!

            David

David, your best bet is to try and get Marty Goodman. Second best: there
are a couple files covering use of a Teac 55 as a 360K drive in the CoCo SIG,
and some files covering several drives and settings. Check the hardware section
of the database!

THAT! problems was in my EPROM....The "SLOW" command had been zapped by
a BUG ...one bit changed "SLGW" So I,m thinking it was in SLOW mode,and it
was STILL in FAST mode<Shheee>a bit slipped in my Eprom....There is no CPU
settings as you put it<g> the only ajustment is a Ajustable preset pot on
the Motor board<sometimes>.SPEED is set to +/- 4 at 300 rpm..mine were

Actually, Gene sent me the older version of LZH, and I tried downloading the
LZH version. That did the trick! There is apparently a bad "xlh" file in the
AR archive!! Someone else needs to d/l the AR file and burst it to see if
they get the same results before it is condemned though.

Well, no need to condemn the file yet! I downloaded the AR'd version (it took a
few tries), but all is working fine! The only thing I haven't figured out is
how to melt non-lzh files with it. I gathered from the docs that this can be
done
but Ihaven't had any success yet. I tried to upload that xlh file,BTW, and the
ol' bitbanger just isn't up to it. Too much for it to handle, I think. I can
send a copy Snail Mail, if you'd like. Let me know.

Which old LHA are you referring to?  What I've experienced is that the old
"unlzh" works pretty good.  The Matt Thompson version cannot handle extended
headers, and it inserted an extended header of its own - unless you excluded
it - that no other lha could burst.  I have 2.11c, but haven't fooled with
it much.  It won't be able to burst arcs with the Matt Thompson header.

I may be off-track here, but thought this might be your problem.

That was indeed the problem, David! I WAS using the Matt Thompson LHA at
first. Got 2.11c working now, for some reason the two times I d/l'd the
.AR version, the xlh file was bad.. maybe a bad sector on the disk? AnyWAY,
I d/l'd the /lzh file after soemone sent me Matt's LZH via mail. Worked like

You mean my msg worked?  I actually intended to delete the request to send
it but it slipped by.  <G>   After entering it and reading subsequent msgs,
it seemed that there was a glitch in one of the archives.  It was a few
days before I uploaded and forgot.  Guess a blind hog will find an acorn
occasionally   ;-)

I like the 2.11 quite well, from what little I've used it.  Seems maybe a
little faster than Matt Thompson's.  Matt's seemed to work OK, but it
didn't seem to enter _its_ extended header correctly so other lha's could
unarc its files, and it seemed to have trouble with other systems' extended
headers.

     John is 100% right!  I used a R/S bulk tape eraser to de-gauss
my CM-8 screen. In fact I did one at a Glenside meeting. Looks REAL NEAT
if you have the monitor on and a picture showing!!! When you do it, just
turn on the de-gausser a couple of feet away from the screen and slowly
get closer and closer moving it evenly around/across the screen area and then
just a slowly move away. That should clear it up. My CM-8 had a green spot
about 10 inches across when I got it, but, it's fine now.

Yeah, Paul just said he thought Chris was doing something to restore the

time in the time critical inerrupt(interrupt) service routine, something
that this chip doesn't really have time to do if its goinf to service
a non-fifo'd comm chip at speeds above 9600 baud. Not have had any msgs
from Chris in a year or so, I haven't had any indicators as to how he
was planning on doing his. Can someone further enlighten us on that please!

I believe that the only programs to read/write os-9 disks from ms-dos
machine are commercial ones.  I have not been able to find a shareware
version. As to your question on the Development Package, many of the
utilities found therein are also in the Level One Package which you
might find at a cheaper price. Someone told you that he heard that
tsmon was not so good but it does the job if you want to connect another
machine to your os-9 system without using terminal programs on each.
You can use your ms-dos machine to LOGIN to the CoCo and see what is on
the CoCo Disks.  There are a few programs from the level One package
that give Level II fits but most of the stuff found in the Dev Pak and
also on Level One works okay.  Many of the Dev Pak items also have been
improved with shareware items found on Delphi.

     BASIC09/Microware BASIC INT function
     From: JEJONES      To: ALL

I was taking a look at a BASIC09 program in the latest *UpTime*, and in the
process of modifying it, I tripped over something that I figured is worth
passing along to others.

I was trying to move some coordinate conversion into a call to gfx2 (bgfx
for those of us with MM/1s), and figured I could turn the moral equivalent
of

 xs := x0 + mx * x
 ys := y0 + my * y
 rs := mr * r
 RUN gfx2(path,"circle",xs,ys,rs)

into

 RUN gfx2(path,"circle",INT(...),INT(...),INT(...))

replacing the ellipses with the right hand sides of the assignments
to the corresponding variables (which were declared integer, of course).

BLAMMO!  It barfed--but why?  INT() returns the greatest integer less
than or equal to its argument, doesn't it?

It finally occurred to me--yes, INT() does return that--but it returns
it as a REAL!  I changed the INT() into FIX(), and all was well.

Kind of subtle, eh?

To run on the MM/1, yes, I did change it to bgfx.  The original
said gfx2, since it ran on the CoCo.

 > I'm confused as it is.  Don't make it worse! <Big Grin>.

I guess I just wanted company--I was confused, too. :-)  I'm
still a little puzzled--the resulting display is clearly symmetric,
but taking advantage of that may take some thought.

I'm still considering how to re-eliminate the recursion after having
put it back in so I could make sure I understood how it worked.  One
can either store the true depth with the stack entry so that entries
are thrown out after use, or one can add a Boolean that tells whether
the routine is on its way down or on its way up, and I'm not sure
which is better.  I'll probably try both of them, just to see whether
I can make it any faster--but the recursive version is much shorter
and clearer.  Eliminating recursion can be a very good thing, but for
pedagogical purposes, IMHO the explicit stack twiddling can distract
the reader.

Well...I think I've about gotten as unconfused as possible, unless I decide
to investigate tweaking some of the parameters.  It's been a LOOOOOOOONG
time since I did a real live proof by induction, but it paid off, because
it showed where the added symmetry is and cut the recursive calls in half,
and will do the analogous thing if I re-eliminate the recursion.  It's
now about five and a half times faster than it was, but it will bug me
until I polish it off by seeing whether recursion elimination will speed
it up any more.

The original 80 track Device descriptor in the BASIC09/CONFIG disk was actually
for the 5-1/4 drive...96 tracks per inch...Just Dmode to that, or plug your
drive in where you presently have your 3-1/2 80 track drive. It's a direct
substitution.

The 40 tracker's were 48 tpi, the 80's were 96. They had descriptors written

Hi David; I'm probably blowin smoke 'cause yer on an MM/1 instead of OS9
level 2 & a CoCo. However, to remind all, if the dmode "dns" var is set
correctly, then the drive can read both 96 tpi and 48 tpi disks. What
happens is that rbf goes and snoops thru sector zero in one of its seeks,
gets that var from the PD data. On finding a disk whose "dns"=01 in a drive
whose descriptor is set at dns=03, cc3disk will proceed to dbl-step the
drive thereby keeping the heads fairly well centered on the data written
by a 40 track, 48 tpi drive. I would hope that the floppy driver for the
MM/1 is at least that smart. To recap, you *can* format and use 96tpi drives
just fine with the dns set to $01, but the driver won't know what to do
when a genuine 48 tpi, 40 track disk is in that 80 track drive. If dns=03
for the 96 tpi drive, then it converts to dbl-step automaticly.
Cheers, Gene

David, I didn't realize you ere doing this on a CoCo! I remember reading
somewhere that the device descriptor has a double-step flag. I THINK you can
use dmode to set the bit for double step, and it will double step to read a 40
track disk in an 80 track drive. Check it out! Then you just set your 80T
drive as such, flag it to allow double step, and go!

I'm not working on a CoCo, Frank.  This is the next MM/1 to shipl.

I am probably going to call a client in the morning to say it will take longer
to figure out, and try to ship without the 5.25 drive.

Critical information to put the above info into context:
 1) what type of CC3 LvII diskettes are you reading? (Assumption from
     the "dns=$01" is that you are using 5.25 double-sided 360K diskettes,
     since 40-track 3.5" drives are pretty rare.)
 2) what type of drive are you using on the MM/1?
     - Hi-density 1.2M 5.25"?
     - 720K double-density double-sided 80-trk 5.25"?
     - 360K double-density double-sided 40-trk 5.25"?

so....

   The drives on the CoCo are 5-1/4 double sided 360k.

   The drive in the MM/1 is a teac 55b 5-1/4 double sided 360k.

I'm still looking for help with my 5 1/4 drive problem.  Apparently I have
my Dmode parameters set right, and Frank Swygerts note lead me to information
that confirms this.   But the drive persists in giving a seek error on attemp
to read a dir, or write formating info.  I've tried a Teac FD55FGR set to s

720K mode with dual speed mode set.  (This one burned up the drive cable when
I tried to toggle J13 (to set line 2 high).  I also tried a Chinon FR-506.

I don't think you can FORMAT a 40T disk in the 80T drive, but CAN read and
wirte to it. Hmmm.. but format DOES allow specifying tracks... but then that
might not double-step the drive, just format teh first 40. You'll have to
try that!

Great timing, Boisy.  Err, I mean the subject, not your absence (GRIN).

I just installed COHERENT on my "386" (missed the "deal" on OS-9000
a couple fests ago - and I want to learn more about UNIX anyway).
Right now, I am up to my ears in Termcaps and Terminfo.  By the time

for the MM/1 into the 386-box ---- or describe how I failed and beg

Great fun.  I set up a Terminfo on my HP-UX box at work for the MM/1,
which I used until I got a good VT100 emulator running on it <g>.

Basic steps from memory (with Coherent, your milage may vary):

  - copy the MM/1 TermCAP entries to a file (say mm1_termcap)
  - enter:  captoinfo <mm1_termcap >mm1_terminfo
  - enter:  mkdir  JRWINFO
  - enter:  mkdir  JRWINFO/term
  - enter:  setenv TERMINFO JRWINFO
  - enter:  tic mm1_terminfo

This will probably create up to 36 directories under JRWINFO/term.
Some of these directories may be empty, but there should be files under
k (k2), m (mm1), v (vsc), etc.  Any empty directories could be deleted.
BTW, this is the same basic sequence that I used for creating the
Terminfo libraries for the OSK ports of 'sc' and 'rogue'.

Now, if you have Superuser access <g>, you can add the new files into the
standard system Terminfo library (maybe under /etc/term, or somesuch).
At work, I had to set my login profiles to include the equivalent of
'setenv TERMINFO JRWINFO' to tell the system to check my local custom
Terminfo library first.

Hope I haven't taken away all the fun ;-)

Good luck... / Ken

Thanks for the info Ken.  Looks just like the OSK procedure I
went through to get a terminfo entry for an old Fortune terminal
I picked up.  So far, Coherent looks just like OS9, but it comes
with a huge file system and things are scattered all over the
place.  I know there is a terminfo setup in there -- all I have to
do is find all the parts. (GRIN).  This IS fun.  It even has
a crippled version of MicroEmacs.  It also came with X-Windows, but
all I can do is play a little with that -- the 4 megs in the 386 box
are bare minimum to run X-Windows (sort of like Multivue in 128k).
Super manual - the book is the size of a big-city phone book and
fairly well organized.  Good online help too.

  That's where those directories came from!!!!! I've been scratching my head
ever since I ran across them a couple of weeks ago. It was 'sc' that
dood it!

   BTW anything new on the G-Windows front?? I've been playing around a lot!

under G-Windows! (THEY said it couldn't be done). I also wrote a file-

<g>  Yes, the current 'sc_616_2' needs that Terminfo library.

Just installed a second hard drive, so I finally have some room to play
around in here.  Hopefully, now I will be able to spend more time playing
with G-Windows.

Would really like to try out your sound player and file-recognizer stuff!

 Curious, who said it couldn't be done?  Perhaps what they meant is that
 G-WINDOWS doesn't include a sound manager ala RAVE, CD-RTOS or DAVID.

 That's one of the nice things about G-WINDOWS.  I'm hoping that programmers
 writing for G-WINDOWS will also include file recognizers and icons with their
 software when it will benefit the user.

  I'm sure thats what they meant. Most sound players will work IF you

  YES!!!!!!!!  Maybe, I probably sould do some checking with Ed and/or
Frank to feel out the potential market. If there would be enough interest
and the SCSI drivers on other machines will support it, I'd like to port
my Audio CD player program to G-Windows! And... Frank has tried a couple
of times to send me a new video driver that supports a Color Lookup Table
so the colors can be changed, but, Delphi (or somebody) keeps shorting me on
the archive's file size. The MM/1 has only two modes that are high enough
for gwindows (640x420 and 768x480 ??). But, my Maggie monitor looks a lot
better (brighter) than the CM8 I use at the shows.

Wellll.... I don't know if I would put it that way.  I consider the Mac
to be more of an appliance than a computer.

I just returned from a two-day business trip, and found three boxes had
been dumped next to my desk at work.  Guess I will spend next week setting
up yet another Mac...  They delivered a Quadra 610 just before Christmas,
but once I got it half-configured, they gave it to someone else, and
replaced it with a noisy old Mac II that wasn't good enough for one of
the secretaries anymore.  I _refused_ to spend the $1800 to upgrade that
dinosaur to handle Ethernet and MacX (plus $1700 for a two-page monochrome
monitor), and they eventually put me on the waiting list for this new
machine.  It's a 7100...

You better believe it.  I've had my system (a System 5) for about a
month, haven't even scratched the surface yet.  Just recently played
around with the auto-ex capabilities.   Truly awesome.  For example,
if you click on a makefile... she'll do the make, automatically.

I think G-Windows is the way to go to give us a truly universal
platform to work from.  Hopefully, enough MM/1 owners will get into
it to become a standard for you guys.

Hi, David -

I might have mentioned to you that I have a fixed mouse driver -- but it
is the one for FHL's G-Windows package.

The KWindows mouse problem is caused by lack of proper error
handling/recovery in the driver.  The mouse transmits data at 1200 baud,
which means roughly one character in 1/120 (0.0083) second.  If the system
is unable to process the incoming characters fast enough, the MC68901
creates an over-run error, from which the driver cannot recover.  (This
is similar to the /t0 lock-up problems folks used to have.  Again, the
early /t0 drivers did not have proper error recovery, so would lock up
after over-run, parity, or framing errors.  Typically a change in baud
rate, such as Delphi/Tymnet's autobauding sequence, could trigger the
problem.)

Long message continues...

Two primary causes of mouse-buffer over-run are:
 - a maxcount value of 65535 used on a fast hard drive.  For example,
   if the drive has a transfer rate of 1.8M/sec, then the system will
   go into DMA mode for about 0.036 seconds at a time when doing large
   block reads -- if the mouse is moved during this time, it locks.  (I
   was disappointed to see that the descriptors in the upgrade from
   Blackhawk still use the 65535 value.)  I have mine set at 2048, and
   while _some_ disk reads are a bit slower, I haven't had a mouse lockup
   due to this problem in well over a year.

 - large graphic updates in the high resolution modes.  I am not aware of any
   current fix for this problem, other than the workaround attached below.

Following is an excerpt from Appendix D of the OSTerm 68K Reference Manual,
which describes this problem and provides a workaround.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 MOUSE LOCKUPS, LOST CHARACTERS AND MAXCOUNT

Several MM/1 owners have experienced problems with the mouse cursor
disappearing and lost characters through the serial ports while doing disk IO.
This is generally experienced by those using very fast hard drives, such as
the Quantum 105.  This shouldn't be a problem for those using slower drives.

The serial mouse, for example, is constantly sending data to the mouse port at
1200 baud.  If the mouse driver doesn't get time allocated to read the port,
then an overflow condition occurs.  When the mouse driver is given time by the
system to read the port, it doesn't detect the overflow, the driver locks and
the mouse cursor disappears.

A similar condition occurs with lost characters received through the serial
ports.  The system is too busy, and misses a character when it is received.

There are two solutions to this problem.  The first one will cure both the
problem with the disappearing mouse cursor and lost characters through the
serial port.  The second solution will restore control of the mouse if it ever
disappears.

Solution #1.
This solution has been described on various information services.  One of the
great virtues of the MM/1 is its great hard drive speed.  However, this comes
at a price.  While the system is doing DMA, it sometimes doesn't have the time
to take care of other necessary tasks.  That is what causes lost characters
through the serial ports.

To reduce the duration of each DMA burst, and thus increase the number of
times your MM/1 has to check for data coming into the serial ports, reduce the
maxcount of your hard drive descriptors.

Moded may be used to modify the descriptor within the OS9Boot file.

This can also be accomplished using dmode as follows:

     dmode /dd maxcount=2048

Save the /dd module, update its CRC and create a new boot disk, and your mouse
lockups and lost characters through the serial port should be greatly reduced.
This size of maxcount (2048 bytes) has been found to virtually eliminate lost
characters and serial mouse lockups on the systems that it has been tested on.
A larger maxcount can be used, but will increase the chance of lockups and
lost characters.



                                    D-1
OSTerm 68K Reference Manual                 Appendix D MM/1 Technical Notes


The disadvantage of this method is that it slows down disk IO.  The choice is
yours.  One 'trick' that can be used, however, is to have a second disk
descriptor available if you need to do speedy disk IO.  For example, if /dd is
your hard drive, you can set maxcount to 2048 on your /dd descriptor, while
leaving it at 65535 on /h0.

Solution #2
Regaining control of a 'lost' mouse cursor.  This solution was described by
Mike Haaland on Internet.

Create a script file called 'fixmouse', set its execution attributes, and
stick the file in your commands directory.  This fix will work if your mouse
is running on port /t2.

          load sc68901                 Serial driver
          load t2.dd                   Port descriptor
          xmode /t2 baud=1200          Mouse baud rate
          iniz t2                      Resets the port

If your mouse cursor ever disappears, simply move to another window, and type
'fixmouse' at a shell prompt.  The script will load in the serial port driver
and descriptor, and reset the port.

The mouse cursor may also disappear during updates of the high resolution
interlaced screens (90x60 for example).  This is a separate problem, though
Solution #2 will restore the lost cursor.

Glad it helps.

I have an 80-track 720K 5.25 drive here (not a 1.2M; sorry).  I thought
I would try looking into your floppy problem to see if I can help shed some
light, but...

I discovered that when I installed my new hard drive, that I had forgotten
to re-install the power line to my 5.25 drive.  Took the system apart, and
found that I had used its power line for the HD, and there weren't any
left ;-(

So, I disconnected one of my 3.5s (actually, it was an accident, but
while it was disconnected, I decided to try hooking it to the 5.25 to
continue the experiment.)

Well, only partial success here.  I am able to read some disks (best
luck with single-sided), but frequently hit error 247s (Seek Error),
especially with double-sided diskettes when trying to access the second
side (i.e., when 'dump -c /c2@' tries to access Addr 12xx).  Could be
an alignment problem between my 720K drive and one or both of my CC3 360K
drives.  (Remember, the 720K drive has to be double-stepped, and reads a
"finer track" than the 360Ks.)

Here's a dmode of my /c2 descriptor, for what it's worth.
 name=c2
  drv=2 stp=3 typ=$24 dns=$03 cyl=80 sid=2 vfy=0 (on) sct=18 t0s=18
  sas=8 ilv=3 tfm=0 toffs=0 soffs=1 ssize=256 cntl=$0000 trys=0 lun=0
  wpc=0 rwr=0 park=0 lsnoffs=0 totcyls=80 ctrlrid=0 rates=$10
  scsiopt=$0000 maxcount=65535

Not sure whether any of this would be of any use for you setting up the
1.2M drive.

Regards... / Ken

Thanks, Ken.  I think that will help at least ot read 720 K diskettes
as this drive is a dual speed drive that can be set in 720k mode.

I may have to see if my client will accept shipment without that drive,
which was an afterthought on his part.  Hate to do it, but I can't even get
a 360K floppy to work on the machine (either mine or his!).

Hi, Chris -

Guess I didn't phrase that very well.  Let's try again ;-)

  "I might have mentioned to you that I have a mouse driver that does not
   exhibit this lockup problem.  It is the one that came with G-Windows."

Nope, never had any G-Windows mouse problem -- Ray Tremblay's mouse driver
for G-Windows handles the error conditions properly.

Hopefully, this will prevent you from encountering any problems! <g>

    Sounds crazy! Just thought I'd check on the drive #, 'cause I had had
a lot of problems getting a third floppy to work. Did finally work, but,

Dave,  I've been seeing this thread, and haven't been paying all that much
attention, but I have one suggestion.   If I paid enough attention, you're
trying to get to get the MM/1 to read a 360k floppy on a 1.2 meg?  If so,
it would be a little more expense for your customer, but would it be
possible to convince him to install a 720K  3.5" on the coco?  This would
make it a lot simpler, as the 1.44 automatically senses a 720K disk.

If he could be talked into doing this, I think it would solve a lot of
problems.

Very good point.  At one time, I envisioned being able to take a coco source
file and being able to compile it without any modifications.  However, I
found this to be quite impractical.  I would love to see as much backward
compatibility as possible, but apparently you see, as I do, that stressing
it too strongly will hamper the machine's development.

Right!  The very reason to upgrade.  The coco is fantastic.  It can do
about anything you desire, but I must admit that now, some things, like
unzipping a file, for example, do seem slow after doing it on the OSK
machine.

     From: NIMITZ       To: ALL

I am trying to port a program from UNIX.  It uses a menu fashion user interface.

The problem is, it mungs the input.  I.E. it asks for input, but when you type
the requested input it does not accept it properly.
hmmm.. Still not clear.....

It asks for an option.  it does not accept the option until <enter> is pressed,
then it immediately presents another input prompt, and the first key presented
to that prompt acts like a carriage return - so it never accepts the file name.
now if you type all the answers to the promp in response to the first input
prompt, you do get P
ARTIAL response to the subsequent inpput prompts.  This program uses getch to
get the initial menu response, then gets to get the following strings.   I
suspect a buffering problem, but can't quite remember what!

I would suspect that it's using either readln() or one of the std. lib
functions (gets() or scanf()).  There are differences in the way Unix
O.  For the option, since you want it to be a "hot key"
try using,

 read(0, $ans, 1);

where ans is a char (oops should be &ans).

To get the filename use either,

 readln(0, fname, 81);

or

 gets(fname);

or

 scnaf("%s", fname);

If you are going to mix system and library calls (read's and gets for example)
you should flush the I/O buffers before reading and after writing.  Normally
it's better if you stick with one way or the other.

Hope this helps.

I haven't THAT much experience with unlzh. I only keep two versions of
that basic family of crunchers on my hard drive here,  Matthew Thompsons
somewhat flawed "lzh", and now thats its availaable, "lha2_11c", which
apparently has grown enough smarts to handle the files made by lzh.

I noticed the revision number was 3_29, is that something I missed in the
databse? I helped a wee bit on 3_24, and thot it was the newest. That, if its a
miss-print, was crunched by lha2.11b, aka lha. The default extension of all
of these crunchers seems to be ".lzh".

On a side note, how many of you have noted that the PGP code which was
claioimed (claimed) to take 40 quadrillion years to break when it was
first defined back in 1977, accompanied by a $100 reward for the first
person to send then the cleartext of the message ppublished with the
article, has indeed been broken and the prize claimed (and paid) by
a group of 600 internetters who broke the problem down into manageable
pieces between them.. That was a 129 digit code, but not to worry, they
also have a 150 digit and a 229 digit version! Clipper chip my a$$!

Heh... That must have been a typo on the RZSZ version, since the most current

Are you using the Disto RS-232?  If so, it may be hard to get rz/sz to work

Yes, he is right. However, OS-2 (or UNIX or OS9K or some other OS) will not
run on a machine less than a 80386. The 640K barrier was originally due to
a design "characteristic" of the pre-80386 Intel processors.

Actually, the 8086 Intel chip can address up to 1 MB of memory.  The
640K barrier is simply because IBM declared addresses above 640K to be
I/O hardware addresses not to be used by RAM.

I've been told that there was some deficiency in indexing registers in
pre-80386 class Intel MPU's. I don't know the whole story.

That may be... I would never want to give Intel too much credit... <g>
We _had_ to learn 8086 assembly for a required Computer Science course
at my university, and it was not that much fun.  Sure it can address
1MB, but only by combining 2 registers, which you _had_ to do.  It was a
terrible way to write code.  It's very easy to see why comparable
programs on Motorola chips are significantly smaller in size than their
Intel chip counterparts!

I just wish that the DOS/Windows machines that I use at home and at work
had some of the capabilities of OS-9 & OSK.  The EXTREMELY STUPID 640K limit
forces so much disk access, constant, constant disk access....
On my old CoCo, I could copy floppy disks faster than I can with a 486, since
OS-9 let me add more memory to the process.  Oh, it would sure be nice if
DOS and Windows could just load a whole program into memory all at once,
without ".OVL" files.  Too much to ask for.

I love ix.  Coco ix doesn't have buffer capture, which would be useful for
file browsing etc.  It does support B transfer protocol for CIS, where
you can go online manually (it'll autodial for you).  For Delphi, you'll
have to use an external protocol for d/l's.  One other tip.  If you are
using SHELL+, you will probably have to modify it to cut down on the
memory it allocates to a program, or what I did was just rename the
stock shell (I renamed it "ohell").  Then I go into a window and do an
"ex ohell i=/1".  Shell+ allocates 8k data to a program, and somehow
ix refuses to run.  The latest version of "ar" (1.92?) also balks on the
13-bit compression with shell+.

 > remain a useful tool.  That multitasking is just too addicting!

And how!  I don't think I could live without it.  My OSK system doesn't
support windowing in the hardware text mode, and I miss being able
to clear to another window.  Of course GWindows has it all, strictly
graphics, however, and a little slower on text display.

     Named Pipes
     From: JOELHEGBERG  To: ALL

I have an OSK question that I don't know the answer to...

Everyone knows that when you type 'dir' at the shell prompt it sends
output to standard out and then ends.  Same thing with the 'free'
command.  How come when I redirect standard output to a named pipe,
the shell prompt never comes back until I send a BREAK?  When I list the
named pipe after trying, only a small part of the anticipated output is
contained within the file.

Examples:
  dir  >/pipe/named  (freezes)
  free >/pipe/named  (same thing happens)

Any ideas?

Hi Joel,

You're experiencing blocking due to the nature of named pipes.
Unless there is a reader process to read the data from the named
pipe concurrently, the process writing to it will block when
writing one more character than the size of the named pipe
buffer.  That size is specified in the /pipe device descriptor
(not sure of the offset, but the size is around 90 bytes).

While you're running the dir command to the named pipe, try
listing the named pipe in another window.  You'll find that the
dir will exit properly, and list will show the entire file.

Because the pipe is implemented as a fixed-size buffer (size determined
at the time it's created), so that when the buffer fills, the process
writing to the pipe blocks, waiting for something to read the pipe so
it can keep writing.

 > When I list the

Probably then you've killed the writing process, so that it didn't get
the chance to write all the stuff it was going to.

To see whether this is happening, try:

  dir >/pipe/stuff &
  list /pipe/stuff

and see whether you get all the output you expect.

Opinions herein are solely those of their respective authors.

The default size of the /pipe FIFO is 90 bytes.  Once it fills, the
process writing to the named pipe will block until another process starts
pulling data out the other end (by reading it).

               dir  >/pipe/named  (blocks after 90 bytes)
   Then go to another window, and:
               list  /pipe/named

The 'list' command should list the entire output from the 'dir' command,
and when you go back to the original window, it should no longer be
"frozen".

The size of the FIFO buffer can be changed when a program opens a path
to a named pipe by using the "initial_size" option of the 'create()'
function, along with the S_ISIZE flag in the 'mode' parameter.  (See
modes.h)

I used named pipes for some of the 'sc' spreadsheet functions.  Worked
great.  Didn't need to fiddle with the size of the FIFO buffer in that
case, tho.

Hope this helps!

Cheers... / Ken

     From: RHELLER      To: JOELHEGBERG

The problem is that the size of the FIFO buffer for a pipe is small, too small
to hold the entire output of dir or free.  What you should do is this:

$ dir  >/pipe/named &
$ list /pipe/named

Programs that write to pipes (named or not) hang when the pipe gets full.  As
the pipe is read from (by some other process), space becomes available and the
writing process starts writing more data to the pipe.

JOEL!!! RTFM!!!! :-)

When a named (or unnamed, for that matter) pipe is created by the shell as a
result of IO redirection, it is created to be only so big. I don't have
my manual handy, it something like 60 or 90 bytes or something like that.
When whatever command is writing to it gets that far, it goes into a wait
until the contents of the pipe are flushed so it can write more to it.

For example, you have a shell in W1 and W2. In the W1 shell you enter:

$ dir >/pipe/temp

After a very short time, this command will freeze. "CLEAR" over to the
shell in W2 and do a:

$ list /pipe/temp

As the contents are listed, the dir command W1 kicks back off again, and
eventually the whole thing completes. You can do this in a single window.
Change the dir command to:

$ dir >/pipe/temp&

Then follow it up with the list command.

One difference is when the command writing to the pipe is the copy command.
When the output pipe is created in this case, it is sized to be the same
as the input file. You can, of course, in your own program, create a
pipe of any size using the S_ISIZE modifier.

I remembered that shortly after posting the message.  The reason why I
got confused was the "copy" command works perfectly fine to pipes no
matter what size the file is.  I had an installation routine for
single-disk systems that would copy an entire 150k file to a named pipe
(using the OS-9 standard 'copy' utility) and then let the user swap
disks and my program would decode the pipe file.  This did not happen
concurrently, so the pipe actually did fill up to 150k.  I guess "copy"
must use the S_ISIZE option when creating a file.

Yep...  I had a mind-blank for a moment.  I got confused when the "copy"
command works fine when copying a 150k file to a named pipe, while
redirecting output from "dir" only allows 90 bytes before it puts the
command to sleep.  I think I get it now... "copy" must use the S_ISIZE
parameter.

That's what must have confused me.  I knew about the default size limit,
but completely forgot about it after the "copy" command would let me
copy a 150k file to a named pipe.

That's what confused me.  I rarely ever use named pipes, and after using
the "copy" command for a while with a 150k file, I just decided to
forget about the small buffer that is normally allocated and think
everything worked the way "copy" does... which would be nice.

That's all well and good and shows how to pass the environment to a module
in a child process, in this case, rename. However, the system still needs
to find rename if it is not in memory. If the programmer expects for the
module of the child process to be available via a PATH in the environment,
then you'd still have to write your own procfunc front end to os9fork().

Picking up on this thread again, I ran across a file here while doing some
hard drive maintenance that I thought you might find interesting.

Cheers... / Ken

PS - "doing some hard drive maintenance" = installing a new 340 megger.
FINALLY should be able to do something productive without first routing
through files looking for something to archive or delete!

---------File starts----------------------------------------------------
   This is from Microware.

 Following is a C-binding to call SS_Rename.

 SS_Rename is used by OS-9/N.F.S.  because the traditional method of
 renaming a file on OS-9 is incompatible with the underlying NFS
 protocol.  (One cannot simply open a directory on an NFS device, rewrite
 or add an entry, and move an FD address around.)

 Not all OS-9 file managers support this SS_Rename setstat.  To allow
 renaming NFS files, the OS-9 utility "rename" was changed to issue the
 SS_Rename setstat.  If the return status indicates the call is not
 supported by the file manager, rename manipulates the directory in the
 historical manner.  It is Microware's intent to support a "rename" C
 library function in the future as part of POSIX compliance.

 By the by, the same type of problem exists for a "delete directory"
 operation.  OS-9/N.F.S.  supports a SS_Rmdir setstat, called by the
 "deldir" utility.

 /* open a path to the directory we'll manipulate */

 if ((path=open(defdir,openmode)) == ERROR)
    exit(_errmsg(errno,"can't open \"%s\". ",defdir));

 /* try an SS_Rename call */

 if (_ss_rename(path,oldname,newname,&errstat) == -1) {
        if (errstat != E_UNKSVC)
                exit(_errmsg(errno,"can't rename file. "));
        else {                  

 /* SS_Rename not supported, we need to set the highbit in the last
    character of newname, seek to the correct entry in the directory,
    and rewrite the name.  (Assumes we've already done a getstat to
    locate the position of the directory entry. Kids, don't try this
    at home... ;-) */

            *(newname+strlen(newname)-1) |= HIGHBIT;
            fnamepos = gsbuffer.sg_dirptr;
            if (lseek(path,fnamepos,0) != fnamepos)
                exit(_errmsg(errno,"can't seek. "));
            if (write(path,newname,strlen(newname)+1) == ERROR)
                exit(_errmsg(errno,"can't write new name. "));
        }
 }
 if(close(path) == ERROR)
        exit(_errmsg(errno,"can't update new name. "));

Of course... duh.  That file looks remarkably similar to a file I have
on my hard drive!  In fact, it is the same one!  :)  I got that (over
the CoCoList I think) a long time ago when I was not yet proficient in
the C programming language, so I did not pay much attention to it, but
since it looked important, I never-the-less filed it away for later use.
Too bad I forgot about it when the time came to use it!  :)

  Doesn't the C version of fork look in memory and  then the exec dir?? The

Yep, basically it allows several directory entries to access the same
file..so, like in my case I have /DD/USR/BIN and /DD/SYSMAN/BIN contain
"mirror images" of all commands in /DD/CMDS, this way, I can have only
one copy of say, EDIT on the disk, but it can be accessed from any
of the other directories...

it saves disk space, but it doesnt really get along with the rest of OS-9

In Dynacalc, if you turn off pagination, the program will not ask you for

I replied to this earlier, but will go through again for others benefit! IDE
stands for "Integrated Drive Electronics". The controller is built on the
drive, similar to SCSI. The drive itself MIGHT be SCSI, or MFM, or RLL, etc.,
but isusually a proprietary
 format that varies the amount of data on each track... longer (outer) tracks
can have more sectors than shoertr (inner) tracks. You DON'T low level format
IDE drives normally, but if you do the controller ROM knows how to fortmat the
sectors. As for the b
us, the connector for IDE was designed to be almost identical to the PC/AT 16
bit bus. So it is extremely cheap for a motheboerad manufacturerto intergrate
an IDE interface on the motherboard. It requires a few inverted lines.... five
nickel chips will ma
ke an IDE interface out of a standard PC/AT bus connector (nickel in large
quantities!)! Some of the lines are inverted. An 8 bit card is more expensive
because the 8 bits have to be cached and sent out as 16 bits and vice versa,
and there are more signal
conversions. Theoretically, an 8 bit card SHOULD work in a B&B interface with
the B&B drivers. All IDE drives have an "emulation" mode where they will
emulate a certain type MFM or RLL drive. The manula with the drive will state
something about what drive
type (sectors/heads/etc.) to use if your computer doesn't have a programmable
drive type. OS-9 may not like that though, so if ytodecide to try that, you're
on your own!

     hard drives

Oh i just read the message you replied to, thats an OLD message!
yeah what happned is i was looking to upgrade from my 30 meggers to something
larger. (i still have that B&B + 2 X 30 meg drives system) what i ended
up doing was buying a ken-ton SCSI adaptor and an 85 meg drive. I had sitting
on the side a Quantum pro drive which was supposed to be used for my MM/1
which i never got, so i put that online with the 85 megger. Then, i made a trade

to obtain another 30 meg SCSI drive, but upon hooking it up, i blew out the
Quantum drive AND the 30 meg seagate (the power connector was reversed!)
The seagate drive's logic board is dead, but mechanically its ok. So im
looking for a new board for it (not killing myself to do so)
So i ended up buying a second 85 meg SCSI drive for my system, threw out
the quantum drive and am running with 170 megs now for the BBS.

My old system (B&B 30 meg X 2) is sitting on the shelf, never sold it. my
second coco has a B&B 20 meg system, and for that machine, 20 meg is plenty.
I figured since i had to upgrade, i went to SCSI which is far faster.
(megareads are down to 18 seconds on this system!)

Dynacalc files can be of varying size depending on the size of the spreadsheet
in question although I do not know what is the maximum size.  As far as
printing.......as FOR printing Dynacalc files, the Dynacalc function for
storing text files is nearly useless because Dynacalc inserts numerous

I think your record storage is limited by your memory.  With level 2, (you
_are_ using a coco, aren't you) I think you can get about 32K or so.  You
can get more if you dump help, I think.  Never used it much, but it seems
to be pretty good.

        Dynacalcs are always available. The most it will possibly cost
is $20 for a new one (from CoNect...the $30 price is a typo). Used are less
I expect.

Well, this is a guess, and for the record I dont even have OS-9000
but here goes..

For the most part, I'd say you need G-windows for OS-9000 to do any
real heavy graphics stuff..but for simple stuff, I think all you would
need is a C lib. function to do it, if Mware hasnt included such a thing
then I would be willing to say that they havent included provisions for
it with OS-9000, they do offer a package called QD Menu Maker or some
such thing, that will allow you to make color text based GUI's that
you see painted on the face of many DOS apps...I suppose the best way
to do graphics stuff with OS-9000 would be to get Gwindows, the next best
would be to launch a DOS session and use a DOS based programming language

                                                         -* Mike

BTW, have you checked the manual for any kinds of screen codes that could
be sent like on the CoCo ? I doubt it is possible without some external
stuff like QD menu maker or Gwindows, although, you COULD probably write
routines to manipulate the video card yourself...

The /term device in OS9K is an ANSI device. So the ANSI codes to
change the colors are what you need to use.

Lessee, I got that info around here somewhere, let me go looking ...

Here is a file you might want to capture and save:

                                Villanova University
                        Campus Computing - Terminal Emulation
                  Includes VT100 and VT52 Terminal and Control Codes

        This file contains control and terminal codes for the VT100 terminals,
ANSI terminals, and VT52 terminals. Many of the codes were derived from PC -
INTERCOMM, from Mark of the Unicorn Software.  I have researched some of them
and added some of my own.

                                        Thank you,
                                        Jim Mc Ree  (209507097@VUVAXCOM.BITNET)

        Exit print controller   Esc [ 4 i

LINE SIZE:
---------

        The following is a list of the available styles of printing on the
screen.  "Yes" in any column means that the option is supported by the escape
code on that line.  "No" means that the option is not supported by the escape
code on that line; however, it may, and almost certainly is, supported by
another escape sequence.  Double height and double width double the size of the
characters in their respective ways (ie. Double height is twice as tall as
usual).  _Line designates underlining.  Blink is for blinking characters.  Side
is the orientation of the character.  Normal means that there is no orientation.

Top and bottom refers to the position of the character in order to make a
complete character.  The top and bottom sequences will be important if you use
the double height option.  You will need to print the line twice to get a
complete line.  The first printing will print the top part of the characters and

the second printing will print the bottom part.  Inverse refers to the condition

of the character.  "No" indicates that the character will be printed in the
color it normally is printed in with its usual backround.  "Yes" means that the
character will be printed in the backround color and the character's backround
will be the color it is usually printed in.  Shade refers to the brightness of
the character.  Normal is the standard brightness of the character.  Bright is
bold type.  Dark is a darker brightness than usual.  The escape code is the
command you would type before the text you want to print to get the indicated
effects.  This section was greatly expanded in version 1.1 of this file.

Hi Frank! (and ALL)

RE: msg #84597 - connecting a terminal to the CD-I player.

  I was talking to my CD-I player today. NEAT! You can run several tests
on the CD-I player, including ROM and RAM tests. It occurs to me that a
CD-I disk with a few utilities (like dir and an upload program) would allow
the CD-I to be used as a CD-Rom reader! The serial connection would be a bit
slow (9600 maybe more), but, it would be cheaper than buying a CD-Rom reader
if you already have the CD-I.

  Anyone else done any poking around??? IS there a magic key-sequence to
allow more access to the CD-I innards???

Yes, BUT compilers can certainly do such simple guesses as ``take
the largest stack requirements of any function'' to set the
stack requirement.  (Better, look at the static call-graph with
recursions removed to generate an estimate.)  As a friend of mine
once commented:  ``if your programming requires solving the halting
problem to compile, then your programming is TOO messy!''

    Simply assuming every program can get by on 3k of stack space
(as C 3.2 seems to do) is a rather weak way to estimate stack
requirements.  Simple heuristics can be amazingly effective.

     RE: zmodem crash recovery (Re: Msg 87013)
     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: MITHELEN

Hmmm...  Since crash recovery is handled by the ZModem receiver,
and not the sender, performing crash recovery on downloads should
be possible regardless of Delphi's implementation.  There are
other factors that can prevent crash recovery, and ZModem's
negotiation of such issues of crash recovery is not entirely
effective (receivers can take sender suggestions entirely
too literally), but a failure of crash recovery is generally
due either to on-the-fly file conversions which make seeking
impossible (e.g., most ZModem implementations forbid recovery
of ASCII transfers) or due to an obstinate receiver.

    Also, crash recovery is thoroughly documented in Forsberg's
1988 ZModem description, which is LONG before Delphi implemented,
so there's no excuse there for Delphi not supporting it.
                             - Tim Kientzle

I have no problem with ZModem crash recovery using my Macintosh with
Delphi, so I would imagine it would be something in the RZ program
itself.  My Macintosh terminal program can recover from in-stream
errors, and can also continue receiving a partially received file later
on that it left off on from another session.  I once had my ZModem
driver go down during a transfer (Delphi just kept on sending away, of
course), so shut off the modem, turned it back on and dialed back up and
requested the file again... ZModem picked right up where it last left
off and successfully received the file.

Right Joel... It is the newer releases of rz/sz that have no way of
switching on recovery from the receiveing end. The OS-9 version of
RZ/SZ strictly conform to the official Omen release of the rz/sz Zmodem
sources, because they use the official sources. I imagine your Mac
software is usining its own interpetation of the zmodem description.
Perhaps in a future release I do for OS-9, I will set zmodem receive
(rz) up so crash recovery is normally switched on, or, add the extra
coimmand line option to turn it on... this would solve the "problem".

     RE: zmodem crash recovery (Re: Msg 88406)
     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: MITHELEN

Hmmm...  The thinking in ZModem is that the receiver largely controls
things like that.  There is a provision for the sender to provide
`suggestions' to the receiver, but it _should_ always be possible
to specify options such as crash recovery to the receiver.
   Though I haven't tried it, the `rz' I have here (version 3.17,
I probably downloaded it from Delphi) claims to support crash
recovery through the `-r' option.
   Last week, I uploaded a program called `xy' which supports
XModem/YModem file transfers.  It's like my earlier `xydown',
except that it should be much more robust and supports both
uploading and downloading.  I'm in the process of writing a
similar program called `z' which (you guessed it) supports
ZModem.  One big question I have is which of ZModem's many
options people actually use. I'm interested in finding out
which ZModem options people most often use (either with `rz' or
`sz' or any other program) so I can determine which options
`z' should have.  I don't want to put in every option, since
I think that's simply too complicated.  `xy' can be used in
most situations with no options at all, and I'd like `z' to
be equally user-friendly.

     blocked IO

Spent some time with the F$Alarm syscall under os9 68K. Succeeded in
writing some BASIC code that prompts user for an alarm time, sets
alarm, goes to sleep, and then wakes up and rings the bell (PRINT
CHR$(7)) when the alarm signal is sent. Works fine from the OS9
prompt with alarm("94/07/05 17:00) for example but I had in mind
letting the user go alarm("94/07/05 17:00) & to let the alarm
process run in the background. While this runs, the alarm bell is
blocked and can only be heard if I strike <ENTER> at the keyboard.
Do I have to open a window for the alarm process to run in? Seems
like there ought to be a better way!

If you find one, let me know.  I've had this problem with a number of
projects (ModJukeBox, Announce, KWSaver).  I generally have to open
another window.  Also, even if you aren't even sending a character to
sound the alarm (sending character $07 to stdout), but rather are using
a digitized sound sample, even the _ss_play() setstat is still blocked,
so there seems to be no easy way out.

Nope, I never released a commercial version, as I am getting an MM/1 soon
and development for the CoCo will most likely slowdown, so, what I did
was add a bunch of features and stuff in, and release the source code so
other programmers can add features as they like, I may play with it some
more in the future, but most likely I will bring it to the MM/1 ..

While on the subject, if anyone wants it, I have a "version" of the
IndiBATCH program interpreter that supports IF/THEN/ELSE/ENDIF logic
which of course allows for really nice startup scripts for the program..
my coco is getting stripped, so, if anyone wants a copy of the code
I will have to send it on diskette via US mail..

umm.. name=name+$FF definatley will not work. The reason is that $ff is a
number (255 in decimal) so basic thinks you are trying to add a number
to a string..obviously that will bomb out, instead try name=name+CHR$($FF)

 To add one string to another, Basic has to find the end of the first string
 so it knows where to start appending the second.  I recall you passed a raw
 directrory entry to the routine which is terminated with high bit set so
 Basic09, looking for a $FF, was unable to find the end of it.  You would
 have the same problem in C if you tried to do a strcat(name,"\xFF") if
 'name' was a raw directory entry.

     From: CPERRAULT    To: ALL


        This is just a note to let everyone who has been helping me that
   my problem with my Protector program has been SOLVED. Special thanks
   to Mike Guzzi who sent me the corrected code to get me over that
   hurdle, as well as everyone else who offered suggestions and ideas,
   which were very usefull. You can all count on hearing more from me in
   the future ;-).

         I had a longer message detailing the old code, and the fixed
   version that Mike got me, but when I tried saving it with my editor,
   it saved the file wrong<dunno what I did still>, and I lost that as
   well as another reply I typed<so if someone here doesn't get a reply
   from me, you know why<G>.
         Thanks again

     RFI
     From: MMCCLELLAND  To: MARTYGOODMAN



Hi there Marty!

  I received the WEFAX software in the mail and it works great. I am having
some nasty RFI problems though. This interference seems to be coming from my
CoCo, and it ruins the little reception that I can get on my old Hallicrafters
SX-71 shortwave. This interference occurs in large clusters of "spikes", which
are separated by a space about as wide as the CoCo's clock frequency. My 2
meter HT receives similar interference, except that it is so bad that all
stations in the band are wiped out completely! The problem is especially bad
during disk accesses and while using WEFAX. An outdoor antenna would probably
solve my HT's problem, but I do not have a means of connecting a better antenna
to my shortwave. I have thought of shielding my CoCo and using ferrite beads
and toroids and the like, but I don't know how to go about doing such a thing.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

     RE: RFI (Re: Msg 88430)
     From: MARTYGOODMAN To: MMCCLELLAND

I'm glad the WEFAX software is working for you.   RFI can indeed
be a severe problem with systems like the CoCo, with cables going
all over the place.   It's impossible to say what, if any, simple
maneuvers will significantly improve the problem.   Here are few
suggestions:

   (1) Get the ferrite core from an old YOKE used on a discarded
TV picture tube, and loop your disk drive cable
around it two or three times, as near to the disk controller as you
can reasonably get.   This has in the past been reported to
reduce RFI during disk acess.

   (2) Simply MOVE the RADIO a significant DISTANCE from
the computer installation.  This might help.   Since the signal
going to the computer from the radio is line level audio,
it should happily survive 25 feet of audio coax cable.
Or more.   Of course, there's the question of whether that
cable is carrying RFI from the computer to the radio, but I suspect
you're dealing more with stuff picked up fron the air waves.

(3) Try wrapping any other cables that leave the computer
(joystick, printer) around torroids, too.


   There are also tricks involving grounding that may be helpful...
like bringing all the grounds from everything that leaves
the computer to one central point.   That can be tricky to
do on an unmodified CoCo.

    You know, there's a whole SCIENCE (and art!) of making
a computer free of RFI.  It's called in some places "Tempest"
technology... the code name for computers designed to be
so "silent" that you can't pick up by radio information on what
they are doing.   It was a big deal in the spy business a while ago.

 At one time, I had the pleasure of connecting a Sinclair ZX81 to radio.
This unit was renouned for it's rf problems- in fact used uhf36 as video
]
to get out of it's own way. It's shielding was comparable to the CoCos
(none) and it didn't even have a disk drive to toroid.
        The solution on this puppy was a large sheet of aluminiu7um
($13 at the friendly builder mart for a 3x3foot) placed between the radio and
the system, and tied to earth. I had the radio on a metal shelf, in essance.
Helped quite a bit.

Downloaded the sysgo archive available in new uploads. Source was
contained in the archive which allowed customization of sysgo. My
question is after you have edited sysgo per your needs, what do
you use to compile it? R68 seems to generate an inappropriate

r68 creates relocatable objct files, you then need to use l68 to
link in the "glue"... ie.
     r68 sysgo.a -o=sysgo.r

I don't know if this is needed or not, but I had to also reference the
usr.l library in the l68 step, so it would be:
r68 sysgo.a -O=sysgo.r
l68 sysgo.r -O=sysgo -l=/dd/lib/usr.l -l=/dd/lib/sys.l

Possibly, I didn't try to compile the latest version. I just tried
the version I had, and it didn't need usr.l. It all depends on

 Use usr.l OR sys.l this is due to the different offsets for some of the
data (device drivers and such). The system calls and stuff are in both.

Hmmm...  I thought I got unresolved references when I left one of those
libraries out, but didn't play around too much since including both of
them worked.  I should have known to consult an official assembly
language programmer like yourself before attempting this at home.  <G>

   If you were assembling sysgo ( a SYSTEM module ) then sys.l would be the
library to use. If you include both, the first one with a answer (even a
wrong answer) would be used.  <g>

    And no, I havn't popped for the Develoers Pak yet. Frank already replied
that his machines have the hardware but, no  drivers. He did suggest that I
consult Gespac as to the market.

     uud/uue
     From: TEDJAEGER    To: ALL

I have received a couple of text files and a program in my mail
here at Delphi that were compressed using uue. I visit Delphi
using InfoXpress which grabs my mail automatically. In each case
the compressed files have been captured but not separately from
the text message from the sender that announced the compressed
files were coming. What I see if I read the message is like:

    Ted, Sending you some documentation....
and then a bunch of garbage

I can save the entire message to disk but InfoXpress gives me
no way to separate the uue compressed docs/program from the
ordinary text. Anything I can do to salvage this mess? Maybe if
I knew if there was a standard header for an uue file I could
look for it and zap the text?

The uuencoding method is quite robust, and the best thing is they do
have a standard header (a "begin" line) that contains the filename.
Because the actual encoding begins after the "begin" line, you don't
have to zap the text before (or after) the encoded message, since
uudecoder programs just ignore all text before the "begin" line.

The only problem you may have with IX and uudecoding is if the message
is long enough, sometimes Delphi will have to print the message "Press
RETURN for more..." and then a blank line, and then the rest of the
message.  That will screw up the uudecoder, so you'll have to do a
search for "RETURN" and delete those lines.

  The uue files are actually converted to text so they can be sent at 7
bits per byte. After you save the message to disk run 'uudecode <filename>'
and uudecode will extract the file from the message. I (almost) always
get a lot of complaints from uudecode (Checksum error in line #), but,
it always extracts properly.

  I got uudecode and uuencode from the Tops disks, but, I'm sure someone
can tell you where it is here.

sometimes when I first turn on my machine that the right arrow key will
not work for a while and also I am not able to do a shift-cntrl/break
