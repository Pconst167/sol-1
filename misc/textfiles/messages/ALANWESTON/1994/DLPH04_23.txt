Just my 2 cents.

I bought an Epson Stylus 300 this past weekend for $250.  The output
quality is fantastic.  Highly recommended.

It's not complicated at all if we're talking about powering the S/P from
an external power source. Normally a voltage is supplied on the parallel
port of a printer that is used to power the interface. The Epson printers
and some others lack this voltage. All you have to do is connect a ground
and a DC voltage to the pin that normally get's power from the printer. I
would have to look to remember which pin it is. 18 comes to mind, but I'm
not sure.

     The first bubble jet I looked at was an older BJ-100. I toyed with a
BJ-200 tonight, and I think I'm going with it. It has built in Epson
emulation and 360dpi like the Epsons I've looked at. I like the smaller
foot print this model has as well. The only HPs I could find were the
color models. The bubble jet can be packed up in short order. I even
considered the HP personal jet portable, but it was to slow for my taste.
I want an ink jet because I need to produce proffesional quality manuscripts.
Lasers are getting cheaper, but the inkjet will do nicely.

Does anyone know where I can get source code for Heapsort in Pascal for
OS-9/6809? if it isnt OS-9 specific, I could port it..I have a description
of Heapsort in a book I picked up on computer algorithms, but it is in
FORTRAN, and I have zero experience with FORTRAN sooo.. and even if I
figured out enough syntax, it uses line numbers, and I would like to get
a completly structured version.. thanks for any info in advance..

Look in *Algorithms* by R. Sedgewick, first edition.  Well, perhaps the
second edition, too, but I know for sure that the code in the first
edition is in Pascal.

_Algorithms_, by R. Sedgewick, 2nd. edition, does indeed have a Pascal version
of heapsort (at least mine does).  Pages 148 through 161 talk about the heap
data structure and auxillary functions for the heapsort.  The sort itself is
on page 156.  I would suspect that a local libary would have the book, or the
library of the nearest college.  If you still can't find it I can type the
code in and mail you a copy.

     MM/1 & VGA Monitor!

There is a monitor that can be used with the MM/1 AND a VGA (clone) computer...
CHEAP! Electrified Discounters has NEC MultiSyncII monitors (renewed, with 90

and mono TTL signals. Max resolution is only 800x560 thoh... standard
VGA only (640x480... SVGA is 800x600 or higher). doesn't say if there are
composite inputs, could be!?? Phone number is 1-800-678-8585, 24 hours, and
they take plastic (2.5% surcharge). Shipping extra, of course.

I'd be willing to bet that my nitro'd drivers will run in your pboosted
system. I forgot to mention theres another module that also goes into the
bootfile in addition to the two descriptors, its "wpdrv" and is basicly
the co80 code plus a co-module front end thats about another $20 bytes.
And theres one other possible gotcha to running the exact same drivers
I am, the horizontal sweep speed of the monitor. Mine is running at about
(here I fire up the scope and measure it) 18.28 khz. This is a bit faster
than a regular pack will run it at. Its controlled by the software
initialization of the chip, and the reason for it is that it gets rid of
all that wasted border space, using the full screen width and height minus
about 1/4" on each side.  The defaults lleave about an inch all around and
waste a lot of screen space in so doing. The typical monitor like a
Magnavox "PC MONITOR 80" doesn't mind it a bit, mine has been running like
that now since 1986, 8 years! Sometimes 3-4 days at a time.  The horizontal
sweep being that fast is however in all probability an internal adjustment
though. The typical rear panel horizontal hold just doesn't have that
much range.  I never did write up the exact locations and effects of all
those "init" bytes but I can look in my wordpack docs and figure it out
from there if we have to change anything. This could get even longer, and
more boring to those so unlucky as to not have a wordpack, or slot space
for it, so lets do it in mail.  Cheers Charley, Gene

Thanks for that info, Ken. I knew we would need new software but did
not realize that the 31.5 HZ sync was associated with those weird
dimensions of the image. For the sake of clearing my head further,
could you explain this? In the Kwindows docs provided by Mike Sweet
one can find a description of the window display type call (1b 20).
Parameters 0a and 0b are said to produce a 640X480X16 (VGA) and
320X480X256 (VGA) screen respectively. In fact these parameters dont
work with the call but were they intended to use the 31.5 HZ sync?
I figured they were and had been switched off to protect us destroying
our Maggie/Radio Shack monitors. The docs do not suggest that these
"VGA" modes are interlaced. Is Kwindows ahead of the hardware here?

     _ss_play
     From: MREGC        To: ALL

Using the _ss_play call from the MM/1's C-library, I notice that, on some,
actually many apparently random occasions, the sound seems to play at a much
lower speed than normal.

Does anyone know of any problems with the _ss_play command? Could it just be
that _ss_play can be affected by the CPU having a pretty heavy workload?
I doubt the latter, since I've never noticed such a phenomenon when running
any (with the exception of one) of the several digitzed sound players we have
available.

Anybody got any ideas?
