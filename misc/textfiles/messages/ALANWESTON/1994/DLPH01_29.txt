"signatures" that contain more content then the actual message body have
always anoyed me... same goes for people that quote 20 lines of a message,
and then add a 1 line response... I usually only add my full signature on
messagews that are at least a half screen long *ie 10-12 line of message body).
Maybe programs like IX should support add a short sig for short messages, and
onl;y put a full sig on long messages...

All that signature/quotation stuff goes on all the time on Usenet, and
I've never been bothered by it, but it bugs me when I see it here... which
is probably irrational on my part.  Maybe it is because the extra
transmission time it uses up happens during my Usenet's newsfeed,
automatically, and I am not really even paying attention... I am off
drinking a cup of coffee and reading a book somewhere, usually.  But
here, I have to sit thru each one as it scrolls by in real-time.  It
isn't really all that annoying... except in the aggregate.  The InfoXpress
message is only a one-line blurb, but it seems to come out almost every
time.  On the other hand, if I wrote such a thing, I would probably want
SOME way to see what messages were posted by my fabulous creation, for
ego reasons if nothing else.

My UUCP, for example, puts a short version string in headers for email
that it posts, for example, that enables me to see what version of my
software posted it.  It's only maybe 10 characters, but it's really the
same thing.

Actually, this message is also being posted via InfoXpress, but you will
note that my 'sig' does not mention it -- the tag you have been seeing
mentioning InfoXpress is not hardcoded in the program.  I removed mention
of InfoXpress because I occasionally send messages from here back to my
office.  I think most of the signatures that DO mention InfoXpress have been
consciously set/retained by the poster as a reflection of their satisfaction
with the program.  (And Dieter's tags are my personal fave's!)

InfoXpress has most of the properties you described for D-Lite, except:
  - capture of new database upload descriptions is still "forthcoming"
  - there don't seem to be many bugs (or at least I haven't been
    encountering them)

That's not just bots, though they perhaps make it easier.  rn, and probably
other (non-automated) news programs, provide for a .sig file; any offline
editor makes it trivial to include a signature file; and goodness knows
how many people have macros/hot keys for their terminal programs that
bazooka barf ASCII pictures of Bill the Cat or whatever signature text
they've decided on down the comm port.

   I've had the same problems trying to log in these past few days and tried
both tynet and sprintnet with the same results.. mostly got `Delphi Busy'...

Sorry about that brother, although at 4AM I am having no problems.  Of course

it?  The last time we did a computer upgrade at work, we lost one of our comm

 > candidates and even newspaper cartoon artists.  Delphi's going to grow

  I hear you <g>.  I at first though it was at my sprintnet dialup due to
the fact I've had much trouble with that.  I called sprint a few weeks ago
and found out that there modems were going south :)  When I started having
trouble again, I was chalking it up to `Internet overload' at Delphi.

  Well, when you try at different times to log on, and start getting messages
that `Delphi is busy' and such well... makes you wonder.

  Now that the log on speed is back, I'm guessing they got that vax up and
running ok.  I wonder if the new `box' is just one piece or are they try'n
to bring more than one online, due to the expected growth of the `highway' ?

    You may want to try doing this... type:  desktop >>>deskdump
That will redirect all those display codes DeskTop uses to load the buffers
on startup, and maybe even displaying the buffers using OPutBlk... just go
through the "deskdump" file using DUMP and look the the '1b xx' code (whatever
xx is for OPutBlk) and see if you can find anything out that way.

  Could the person that is doing the Kwindows cleanup, rewrite _ss_play(),
so that it can be interrupted. I'm thinking along the lines of having  utgne recording a bunch of stuff
off the movie 2001. I used Hawksoft's recorder/player which worked great.
  But none of the other sound players will play the files that were created.
  Now I'm not bashing Hawksoft, because at least he has got a program out
that does some of what I was looking for in a sound program. But it looks
like he was in the same boat, being that no one has come out with any
guide lines and/or help for programmers in adhering to some standards.
