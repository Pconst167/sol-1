The harris ACIA chip really only makes a difference when using the coco to SEND
to a SLOWER system... That is because it "fixes" a "bug" with CTS in the
"standard" 6551 ACIA.

The v3.24 rz/sz programs basically have some asm optimized code for CRC calcs,
and also, I finally got buffered writes to the modem port working.

I wish I was up to the task of fixing the compiler, too.  :(  The 687 CPS
was the same as the original 6551, but it also registered 1200 CPS on an
XModem-1K download, too.  About the best I've been able to get out of the
new ZModem is 751 CPS.

Yep.  It really flies compared to the 2400 baud nodes.  There appears to
be less traffic, so you don't get the long delays.  You picked up a
high speed modem yet?  Just wondering...I don't want any competition for
the 9600 baud phone number.  :)

You know, someone else mentioned Missile Command a few weeks/months ago right
here and Mark Griffith (I think it was Mark, sorry Mark if it wasn't!) said
in effect, "Why port 15 year old arcade games to our current computer
systems? Bring us something FRESH, something NEW."

In a way, I kind of agree with Mark, as porting over old games seems a lot
like re-runs on TV. But in another way, I'd kindof like to see this myself,
as I was quite a Missile Commander on the original Atari home video game
machines. Dazzeled my friends by racking up impressive scores. Most didn't
seem to mind having to wait for so long before it was their turn, as I could
take as long as a half an hour or more at a single game!!

Anyone remeber playing Bjork's BASH? Well, Northern Xposure has an OS-9
game now that is nearly identical, only better! They sent me a copy for review,
and I've never got anything up and runnning from OS-9 so easy! You can also
edit the levels with a text editor to make your own levels. For those
unfamiliar with BASH, you have
 probably seen "Arkanoid"... similar. The game is colorful and smooth when
running alone (no background processes). Alan DeKok wrote it. He says that
graphics smotthness will be better if you use "VRN", available from the
database here. The game is $25, an
d full source code is available for $30. The source is over 150K with 10K docs,
and includes the sprite library he developed. So programmers may want to pick
that up also! Contact Northern Xposure, 7 Greenboro Cres, Ottawa, ON K1T 1W6,
CANADA. I don't norm
ally "expose" one of my reviews like this, but there are very few OS-9 graphic
games to go around!

Why port 15 year old games to our current system?  Because it is a classic
game, enjoyed by many.  It must make SOME sense to port it to a current

To be honest, I never owned a 2600 myself. I had several friends who did
when they were at their heyday. One was where I got all my Missile Command
playing time.

We are showing our age, here, Boisy. You as a kid and me as an old timer. My
first experiance with video games was at the beer halls at the beach when
I was 23-24, timeframe was 74-75, when PONG hit the scene with a smash. It
was immensely popular with a certain set of beer hall gamers. In those
days it was hard to compete against pinball machines, and the previous
newcomer during that time, the foosball tables. But PONG endured, and I got
right good at it. Another one I liked (can't remember the name) was a game
which started out with a screen of dots which were equally distributed
on the screen. You had a "ball" which was the same size as the dots which
once it came up from the bottom would bounce around the top and sides and
any dot it ran over was erased. Going down the bottom of the screen lost
the ball. You got two or three balls per game. Object was to clear off the
screen of dots. Oh yes, you had a paddle at the bottom of the screen to
bounce the ball back up with.

I got my first video game late in 1976, a Breakout game I got from Sears.
I think it was made by Atari.

Zack,
I remember I was working for Lafayette Radio in New York while going to college.

I remember when Pong came out, 4 variations, tennis, handball, and I can't
remember the others, after all it was twenty(20) years ago.  I know what you
mean about being an oldtimer.  I remember calling a software vendor that
had advertised in Rainbow.  Their business hours were 3:30 pm - 8:300 pm.
I thought that it was strange, but perhaps it was to allow for time zones.
Anyway I got what I thought was a woman on the phone.  As we talked, for
some time, I was very impressed with the persons programming knowledge.
Finally, out of curiosity, I asked "Why those business hours."  "Well",
came the reply, "I get home from school at 3:15 and I have to get ready for
bed at 8:30".  How old are you, I asked.  "I just turned thirteen."  And
of course I remember the morning I was talking to Microcom Software and
the programmer helping me had to cut the call short, the school bus was
coming.  Gosh Zack, I'm getting old.  Thanks for triggering some memories,
maybe I need a 2 meg upgrade......

I know what you mean about missle commander Zack.  I had a marathon session of
a little over 4 hours before my hands were too cramped to continue.  Boy do I
wish I has a decent joystick back then.  I wouldn't mind seein some of the
better older games ported over but would also like to see new games as well.  I
like adventure games...I haven't seen too many of them for OS-9 (any flavor).
Seems to me there is an automatic opening for new games right there.  If you
have ever played starflight then you can see how OS-9 could really help a good
graphics based adventure game be more playable.  Bot do I wish we had enough of
a user base to attract companies like Electronic Arts to port some of their
games over.

I guess you answered the only comment I truly had, as you mentioned a "6.2
utility". I assume you have the 6.2 upgrade then. I use "Stacker" on mine, have
never had any problems to date, but don't have OS9K either. OS-2 also has a
problem with Stacker AND
DoubleSpace, only it doesn't mess up the drives... checks for the driver, then
if it finds it refuses to recognize the drive (a friend has OS-2 on his
machine.. had to buy a bigger drive because of all this!). OS9K obviously
doesn't check for the driver be
fore trying to read, and therefore corrupting, the compressed drive. Hope that
helps some! Stacker has released a version for OS-2, don't know if it works
with DOS and OS-2 though, might be something to look into.. maybe the
compressed drives are protected
 in some way, or use a different method of deginating whetehr the drive is
compressed or not???

Yah.  Stacker and/or DoubleSpace don't know anything about OS9K nor
does OS9K know anything about such 'compressed' drives.  I am a bit surprised
that OS9K messes up things for MS-DOS.  I would think that theoretically it
shouldn't touch the DOS partition.  But OS9K does do writes to the disk at
times when you wouldn't think it would be. (i.e. 'chd')
I tried DoubleSpace on my system and OS9K could definitel NOT see the DOS disk
anymore.  So I took it off and bought a bigger drive.  This is pertinent to me
because
I need to be able to read the DOS side from OS-9000.

By the way, I used to be Tech support manager at Microware, and now that I am
independent
of the corporate grind, maybe I'll be able to answer a few more questions here.

Maybe I'll even learn how to type and space my messages! ;-)

     From: NICKJOHNSON  To: ALL

I've been inactive in this forum for a while, so I apologize if this
question has been asked before.

    I can't get UltiMuse III version 4.9 to work with NitrOS9. The program
will load, spit out "Um3..." to the screen (yes, it is a VDG), and then crash
after about a half-second of processing (I can hear it on the monitor speaker).
All functions are then locked up; apparently the interrupts get turned off,
since even thhe clear-key ceases to function.

    I've tried using the standard grfdrv, as I thought ultimuse might just
be having a conniption about 25 line screens, but that wasn't it. It also
won't run even with my old version of PowerBoost and standard grfdrv.

   Hi   Nick; Gene Heskett (WDTV5) here. I'm running 4.7.2, ran it with 1.07
   and  1.15/1.16  now, no apparent problems *once* I'd patched vdgint  with
   the  correct patches from Wes G. & Co. for the 2 megs I've since put in.
   Prior  to that, I did have some weird problems, but not anything that I'd
   have  called a crash. My probs were not loading up the full song when  it
   was  running,  and  then  seeing all  those  memory  allocation  failures
   displayed  on  the green screen in those few milliseconds it was  visible
   before  the system de-allcocated the vdg screen on exiting. One for  each
   song  I  had  loaded. So the next Q is which version of Nitros9  are  you
   running?

   My  latest vdgint is $0D6D long, and has a CRC of $AFDFF4 as patched  for
   the  2 megs and 1.15 or 1.16. I'd offer to do a makpatch, but there  were
   apparently  several vdgints in the os9 distribution at various times.   I
   have  two copies of level 2, and the vdgints are different on each master
   copy.  I  got the second one used so it could have been patched  at  some
   point by the previous owner.

   Get back to me in email, I may have an idea.

   I'd  like  to upgrade to a later version of UmUse3, but so far have  been
   unsuccessful  with  my  correspondence to Ragtimer, or  to  Ed  Hathaway,
   KalaSoft,  3801 Brown Bark Drive, Greensboro NC 27410.  UmUse3 was up  to
   4.8.0   when   I  wrote  the  letter  requesting  a  COD  shipment.   Its
   4.9.something  now eh? That was in '92, you mean its '94 now? I've  heard
   of snail-mail, but this is sublime!

   Ragtimer,  if  you're  copying this, its time to reply! I don't  want  to
   appear  to be like this in public, but I now feel as if I don't have  any
   other  choice.  If I wasn't using the program, then I sure wouldn't  have
   spent  the  time  to work out the native mode patches for my  version  of
   Um3play and publish them for others not so fortunate in coding skills.

   NICK, *if* you are running native mode, then Um3Play will not drive  your
   keyboards  via  the bit banger as the effective baud rate of 31250 for  a
   midi driver is cranked up to approximatly 38000 by running in native mode
   due  to the pipelining of instructions by the 6309 in native mode.   Once
   you  get  the correct patches for vdgint, take a look here in  the  music
   database,  there are 2 sets of patch instructs for Um3Play that I know of
   there  which  will  restore  it provided they are  for  your  version  of
   Um3Play.  I've  no  idea how many diffferent actual versions  of  Um3Play
   might exist, but the patching I did is described well enough to allow the
   same  idea  to be applied at a slightly different offset in the file.

   I  first bought a hardware midi adapter and modifed an rs-232 pack with a
   3 megahertz crystal to drive it. I had visions of also recording thru the
   device, but apparently the 6551 I have in that pack won't receive at that
   clock  frequency.   I  expected to have probs with lost data, but  I  get
   absolutly  none  when  I open a path for reading from it! It drove  my  2
   keyboards  rather nicely but I also wanted to drive the bit-banger in the
   event  I  needed that slot in my mpi for something else.  The  patches  I
   uploaded were the result.  They'll also start it up from a multiview icon
   dbl-click.

   Cheers, Gene

Try giving Ed a call: (919) 294-1558.

    I'm running ver 1.15 of Nitro, and I have not a clue about what is
causing the problems. Like I said, it wouldn't even run with Powerboost
in the non-native mode.

    I'll worry about patching Um3Play after I get the program to execute

    I have the 2-meg upgrade, but I haven't installed it yet. I would suspect
that my problemnn       is most likely interrupt-releated however.

Just a thought, tho you have probably already covered it.  Have you
connected the CD line to anything?  The 6551 refuses to see incoming
data unless the CD line is true.  (e.g., strap DTR to DCD.)

Yes, the small VDGInt versions will only work with 512K.  Alan is
aware that there is a problem, but has been busied out with university
and other things lately.  He isn't sure when/if he will get a chance to
look at the problem.  There was a possibility of another user working
on it, but I don't know whether that happened.  I will post a message here
when there is an update.

Yes, and I made a note to myself to reply, but have been really busy lately.

It looks like that drive has characteristics similar to the Seagate ST225N,
so you could try that descriptor.

But I have a "better idea" -- I suggest that you get hold of Matt Thompson's
SCSISYS drivers.  My "scsi47.ar" package did its job, but time moves
forward, and I don't have the facilities to support it now.  And
Matt has now released a package with extra features and utilities.
It also supports sector sizes other than 256 bytes, but I don't think
that's necessary with your drive.

A share-ware version is available in the database here.  The registered
version contains several enhancements (including caching), and is now
distributed by Northern Xposure.  Contact Colin McKay on Internet at
"cmckay@UUISIS.ISIS.ORG" for ordering details (or send me email, and
I will forward it.)

There is a UUCP package coming out for both OS-9/6809 and OSK very
shortly.  Bob Billson has been working on Rick Adams' UUCP 4.2 for
several years along with myself, Brad Spencer and a few others.  Bob
is integrating the package right now and getting ready to release it.

Also coming out within a week is a full port of PALM (an ELM-like
mail reader) for OSK.  This is an excellent program from Jeff
Shepler, who I think has done an outstanding job on it.  Right now
I'm fixing a few bugs with it and will be forwarding it to Jeff
in a couple of days, whereupon he will upload it to Delphi.

UUCP 2.0 and Palm make for a dynamite package.  And best of all,
it will come with source code which compiles under both OSK and
OS-9/6809.  The UUCP port still has a few bugs, but works fine
from my 68030 machine.

Hang in there... it's almost ready... <g>

     OPutBlk ()
     From: MREGC        To: ALL


    Has anyone else here tried using the OPutBlk (), (offset put block) call
in KWindows? Or, more to the point, has anyone gotten it to work?

    I can use the function. However, though it does only "put" the correct
*size* of the buffer I tell it to, regardless of what I set the offset values
to, it "puts" starting at the upper left hand corner of the buffer.

    As I understand it, the correct syntax is:

        OPutBlk (path,grp,buf,x,y,xoff,yoff,xlen,ylen);

    I don't even remember if this call has ever been documented, so perhaps
it was never perfected? Anybody got any ideas?

I've not heard about nor have any documentation for that function.  Is
that the function that lets you put only part of a get/put buffer on the
screen, so theoretically you could have several icons in one get/put
buffer and select the one you want by knowing it's offset into the
get/put buffer?

    That's exactly what it is. And, come to think of it, the example you gave
about multiple icons in one buffer is somethink Mike actually does in one of
his programs, so he function must work properly. Either I'm doing something
wrong or I've got an older version of the library.

Yeah, I believe Mike uses it in DeskTop, and it's a nice K-Windows
feature.  It shouldn't be too difficult to write your own replacement
OPutBlk() function if it comes down to that.  :)
