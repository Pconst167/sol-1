John,
     It is I, Warren that noted the Ymodem in the protocol window is not 
Ymodem batch. Since there exists a Xmodem/1k it would normally be safe
to assume the Ymodem is the batch type. Some time back Xmodem/1k was
erroneously assumed to be Ymodem so that is an old wives tale thing.
    I don't have the specs for Ymodem but you may be able to glean the
operation from the source for xydown if you have that. I beleive it was
distributed with source.  Although that will only be good for
downloading in Ymodem batch.

Flash!!   Flash!!  Flash!!  Flash!!  Flash!!  Flash!!  Flash!!
 
On November 8th, 1993, David McCain at Incor Systems Corporation of 
114 Industrial Park Drive in Soddie-Daisy TN informed me that Incor was 
in possession of 50 complete MM/1 systesm, which they would sell be 
(to me)  as customers purchased them on a cash in advance basis.  On 
January 6th, 1994, I sent them a cashiers check for the first I/O board.
 
Oh January 26th, I received from them an incomplete CPU card.  When I
called to ask why, they told me it was sent to replace the I/O board 
I ordered because they had NONE READY TO SELL.   At this time, Incor 
claims to have 60 or so I/O boards which are bare.  They decline to 
finish them, even though they have been given evidence to confirm that
orders DO exist, including backorders from IMS which Paul K Ward 
intends to purchase from me in order to complete his sales!  Please
call 1-615-332-2119 and ask for David McCain.  
  
Express to him your support for the MM/1 and encourage him to either 
continue production, or make some arrangement to allow BlackHawk
Enterprises, Inc. to do so.    
 
    Without such support, the MM/1 WILL NOT GO ON!!!   Please support us 
now!!!   THANKS!!!!

George,
  The file locking is standard operating procedure for OS9. The Capture
mode opens the file for write only. Thus if you attempt to open for
reading the same file, it will go into file locking.
  The only other problem I have found was trying to use the YMODEM
download in a BATCH mode. The YModem in KTerm is NOT BATCH. I am looking 
into what it will take to make it function in BATCH mode. Right now the  
only difference between XModem and YModem is, with YModem you don't have 
to enter a file name. It gets the filename from the host.
  Also if you are downloading a text file and attempt to open the same
file from another window, it will also go into file locking or worst,
crash the download.
  I have not had any problems opening a file with ME in another window
as long as it is not the file being captured or downloading.
 
 Please keep me informed on any problem that you come across.
 
Regards,
John A. Donaldson

Dear Warren:
 
     I have done the 4 meg hack as directed for a computer with the 68340
accelerator board, as follows:
 
     I used a 74AC32E and connected 
             Pin 1 to pin 16 of U1,  This chip was replaced on upgrade to a
                                     22V10
             Pin 2 to bottom of board, hole at pin 21 of simm
             Pin 3 to simm pin 21 on both simms
             Pin 14 to Vcc
             Pin 7 to gnd
             Pins 4,5,9,10,12,13 to gnd
             Pins 6,8,11 not connected
 
     I installed 2 8megx8bit 60ns simms
 
     I changed init file as follows:
             Address     Value Old New
               $DF             $20 $80   colored memory top of Sys. Ram
               $A4             $32 $38   memory size text 2 to 8 meg, this
                                         is different than the 68070 init
                                         mod which says 3 meg at add. $AA

     I removed the jumper closest to the backplane and rebooted with 9 megs.

     I used a small printed circuit board with holes and traces for a single
chip already present and soldered a socket to it.  I removed the U1 chip and
soldered to the pins on the bottom of the board at U1 for ground, +5v (vcc)
and pin 1.  The grounds and floats for the unused circuits on the 74AC32E were
made on the new circuit board.  Notice that all connections were to empty
sockets, no soldering to the chips.
     I removed the old SIMM's heated the two pins, sucked out the solder, and
then pushed them up and out.  I bent the pin up the side of the connector
and soldered a wire to each and ran it to the new board.  I soldered a wire
to the empty hole under pin 21 of one of the SIMM's and connected it to the
new board.  I carefully checked for shorts and continuity and then installed
U1, the 74AC32E, and the new SIMMS.  The pin 21 connectors can be placed in
the socket when the SIMM is installed and will be held in place by the 
SIMM.
     This procedure is based on Mark Griffiths work and is only for MM-1's
with the 68340 boards.  It is very different from the modifications for a
68070 (original) MM-1 and will not work on those machines.

George,
     I shall also make your upgrade text file a downloadable file in my
MM/1 Official file section. Thank you for sending and proving it out.
