  Hi.  I was talking with Warren Hrach and he told me that you were
intrested in the way I am using syscall on my bbs?? I'm not sure what it 
is that you need to do, but fill me in!  I would be glad to help out any 
way I can.  My program it 'built' from the ground up with MICROWARE
BASIC, and I can't find any getstt or setstt calls to check the CD
directly or force the DTR high or low.  I am using peek and poke to get
this job done <G>.  Its kinda like my own little syscall program.  Just
let me know what you wanna do!  Also I have a question for you...
How are you checking the CD and does your program handle the DTR also? 
If so could you let me in on how you do it <G>?

Bill,
   What I am looking for is the correct header for the registers used by 
syscall. what I have is:
 
  TYPE=address D(8),A(8),PC:INTEGER
 
 One of the modules I am working with looks for the CC register. Is the
CC register passed after the PC register?? What I am looking for is the
full format of registers.
 
   As for CD and DTR, These are handled via a ML routine. Right after I
open the port I initialize the CD handler. The ML program uses the
CDON/CDOFF calls. I am doing a 1 to 1 port of RIBBS. I have taken the
6809 ML routines, translated them to 68000 code, and a friend of mine
then took them and optimised them to work with 68K Basic.
  I am just about to have a minimum system running. That is a user will
be able to call in, login, look around, leave msgs, & read msgs. NO file 
transfer, NO FIDO mail routines will work and so forth. Once this mode
is running, then I plan to add the FIDO Mail routines, so that mail can
be passed from system to system. Finially, when I feel it is usable as a 
BBS (thru not perfect), I am going to start rewriting the whole thing
into C. That port may take a long time if I don't use KWindows. If I use 
KWIndows, it will shorten the time considerly.
  I would be interested on how you are accessing CD and DTR, and ect.
 
John D.

Hello all!

Just wanted to let you know that I have the new version here and I will be
sending it out through the OCN to replace the previous one.

  After positive reactions to my uploading of MM/1 sound playing programs
on chestnut, I decided to make one improvement. I added a short program
called "play". It reads the first four bytes of a file and tries to identify
it as a sound file. If successful, it forks one of the four programs (auplay,
iffplay, vocplay or wavplay) to play it.
  I replaced the file mm1_play.lzh in the incoming directory on chestnut with
the new version. The size of the old compressed file was 8093 bytes, the size
of the new one is 8783 bytes. Nothing else is changed (except for a few words
on the documentation sheet).

Hello warren!

I  just wanted to check and see if this echo was still alive or not. It's been
days since I've seen anything come through in this area. I know things are
quite busy in the MM/1 world but there has not been even a general mention of
anything here.

Tim,
    With the privatization of the MM/1 developers list and cessation of
the cross posting it has been slow.  Much is going on however with the
update beta release of windio53 and a new keydrv.  Look for a general
release soon.  I have a few new files, klogos.lzh (sample kwindows logos 
by Joel Hegberg) and the update for UUCP 'uubb21p1.lzh' which fixes the
renews bugs and a few others.
    BTW RiBBS_OSK should be in alpha-beta release by weeks end.  John A 
Donaldson is just about to hatch it.  When ready for beta release he
will have available like RiBBS To Go, but on 2 1.44 floppys.  I will
probably distribute to those volunteering to beta test.  Haven't decided 
how I will handle but maybe simplest if a person just sends 2 formatted
floppies in mailer with a few $ for S/H and I will copy and return.
