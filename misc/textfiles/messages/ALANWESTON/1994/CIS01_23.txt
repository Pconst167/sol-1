Not to throw cold water on software...but isn't it just as easy to backup (file
by file) the HD to tape or another HD (you can get a HD for about the same
price as the software under discussion). BTW, I saw the program MG is selling
demo'ed at the Atlanta Fest and it appeared to be working well and fast. I did
try the one B&B sold for the Coco and all it did was work for a long time and
then crash my HD. Only tried it once <g>.

You're "preaching to the choir", here Bob. :-)

Since I have a tape device AND a second hard drive on my MM/1a, I on occasion
do exactly what you suggest.

I personally have never really liked disk defragmenters. I bought Chris Burke's
File System Repack for the CoCo and never ran it to completion. The CoCo was
simply too slow, taking well overnight and into the next day to unfragment a
20M drive which wasn't all that fragmented. Think how long it would take on a
120M drive!!!

But I may go ahead and get a copy of the competitor to ARK's program,
Speeddisk, mainly since I have seen it in action and know of some of it's more
advanced features, such as intelligent placement of FD sectors, etc.

I use Speedisk ... and it does a dandy job. Contact Mark Griffith for prices
and specifics.

Since I started using windio.51, I've noticed a few problems that weren't
present with windio.50.  My setup is a 3 MB MM/1a. V.51 restores the
pushbuttons and other functions and also fixes the palette problem. But, since
I started using it, vt100/52 codes are being processed. Anybody know what's
going on here?? Thanks, Alan

Fm: Steve Wegert 76703,4255

For those of you that regularly skip reading the What's New items when logging
on, here's one you shouldn't miss!


LOWER PRICING FOR EXTENDED SERVICES

  Starting 6-Feb, CompuServe members billed under the Standard Pricing Plan
will pay lower rates for access to extended (hourly priced) services. The new
rates for CompuServe's extended services will be $4.80 per hour for access at
300, 1,200 and 2,400 bps, and $9.60 per hour for access at 9,600 and 14,400
bps. This pricing change reflects up to a 40 percent reduction from previous
rates for extended-service products. Communications network and
product-specific surcharges still apply.

  The monthly basic services rate of $8.95, which provides access to more than
50 product areas, remains unchanged, as do rates for CompuServe members billed
under the Alternative ("pay-as-you-go") Pricing Plan.

  Through this pricing reduction, CompuServe is passing along cost savings
realized by the use of advanced technology and "commodity"-priced hardware in
its host computer systems.

  For complete information about CompuServe's Standard and Alternative Pricing
Plans, to check your current billing option or to change from one billing
option to the other, GO CHOICE.
