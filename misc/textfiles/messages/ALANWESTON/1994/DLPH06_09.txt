If you want functionality of inkey$ under OS-9 in C, do this:

    char c;

    read(1, &c, 1);

If the read was successful (you can check the return value for this), then
'c' will hold the character typed.  Notice that you must pass the address
of the character (&c) to the read function so that it will receive the
*address* of c, not the value of c.

Good luck.

BOISY!!

Shouldn't that be:

        read(0, &c, 1);

I like to use this:
   setbuf(stdin) = NULL;

   key = getchar();

It may not be too portable, but you can switch between buffered and unbuffered
stdin as needed (setbuf(stdin) = BUFSIZE; --> sets buffer to what it originally
was).  I used this in a word processor where it was necessary to catch every
keystroke, then test to see if the key called a function or was to be inserted
in the text buffer; but I also had to turn buffering back on for processing
dialog boxes.

There is no way to get one character from standard input with C and
write it so that it will be 100% portable. This whole thing about
portability is taken too far sometimes. Best you can do is write your
own little inkey() function using whatever OS9 Level 2 specific
system calls you prefer to use and if you want to port your app later
to some other OS, you only have a few low level functions to adapt.

And, if you want to keep the code "portable" just:
#ifdef _OS9
 /* your inkey() code */
#else
 /* some other system */
#endif

This is why the #ifdef directive is there, for tose cases when you HAVE to
do something that is gonna be machine/compiler specific.

 Well, right off, you can mail Eddie Kuns(eddiekuns) who is the author of
 Kbcom, if he hasn't seen your message already. Last I heard he was getting
 ready to release a new commercial version of KBCom which, someone correct me
 if I'm wrong, include transfer protocols<xmodem,ymodem, and maybe? zmodem>
 built in. In order to use transfer protocols, you need define them as
 extensions<that is what an extension is, simply a seperate program, such
 as an autodialer or stand alone protocol, which is called from KBcom>, which
 are accessed as a hot key. This really isn't very hard, and the documentation
 does a pretty good job of explaining how to do that. Last I heard, the Coco
 version of KBcom cost maybe 39.99 but that was a while back. It isn't a bad
 price at all, and will be much more worth it if the update comes out :-0)
 I'm glad you brought that up, as I was wondering how KBcom was coming along.

  Also another thing to consider. Unlike most other terminal programs KBCom
 is considered more of a 'terminal envirnment' where it pretty much serves
 as a front end for the protocols and other outside programs<extensions> and
 macros you include. It doesn't include much as is except for the terminal
emulations, which it has a good variety of for Coco term
 programs. It has one of the best implementations of vt52/vt100 from what I
understand. Anyhow, while this offers great flexibility,
 I wouldn't recommend such a beast to a beginner<the shareware version that is,
 Hopefully the commercial version is a little easier to set up and handle>. I'm
 still having a hard time with a few things<I work with it here and there, but
 do get discouraged sometimes>, but once you manage to make it work, it is a
 pretty full featured program.

No, we can't do that. It has already allocated the required number of blocks
(8k each) of system ram (machine ram actually, not system) according to the
value of the var shown as "sct" in the dmode report. My real problem is os-9's
penchant for opening a path to the device in order to use it, thereby
incrementing
the link count os-9 keeps. When the use of that path terminates, os-9 decrements

the link count, and if zero, deiniz's the path(device in this case) which is
why the compiler executives don't report any errors until the second step of
the compile when the file the first step wrote can't be located. The memory
was given back into the free pool by os-9. In fact, the data is still there
mostof the time, but the re-iniz resets the root dir to $40 long and the name
of the file and its data are hidden at offset $40-$5f in the root dir. In
addition, the FAT was re-written, effectivly deallocating the area occupied
by the file. 'sa bit of a catcch-22 that I've had 3 or 4 ideas on how to
fix, but the last 3 days havn't seen the coco turned on, software compat
probs with the Amiga, graduating from the University Of Hard Knocks last
night, and a couple of other items have filled up the time. It will get
done though if I have to write some sort of a routine that lets me access
that linkn count os-9 keeps. So far, diddleing the link count in the device
sector 0, or in the root FD (I forget which at the moment) has not solved
this problem. I have faith that it is solvable, and once I figure it out,
the answer will probably embarrass me in its simplicity. Cheers all,
we're still working on ot. it. Gene

Yes and no. I'm getting too old and lazy to go too many hrs a day/nite
anymore. And I think I've got it, at least the version in memory right now
is working, albeit with lots of output from os9p4 as it execs that can be
removed, no doubt along with probably another 20 bytes of useless code
here and there.  The problem with my original idea of going and accessing
the device table entries while it was doing the autoinit fell flatter than
one of those Carls Road Kill Cafe offerings.  On checking out why I couldn't
find my own entry in the device table, I had to go clear back to Kevs Book,
Inside Os-9 Level Two and study the flow charts. It seems the entry in the
device table I wanted to diddle doesn't exist until AFTER the device Init
routine has been successfully performed! So I settled for tickling a zero'd
var during the init, then any read or write, aftere checking  to see if the
Init has been done comes back and lbsr's to the new code which checks that
byte, and if its non-zero, goes and finds its entry in the device table and
increments it once only. It clears that tally byte so it only does it once
then and returns to the read/write from whence it came from. Kludgy, but
it works so far, knock on wood. I'll clean it up now which should get it
back under $300 bytes total and submit in a few days after I "alpha" test
it some more.  Cheers Roy, Gene

You say you have the kernal all patched and sitting in the root of the disk
just as if it was a normal file?  Fine, then go get my earlier submission
called "krnlutils" or some such. It contains a routine that will A: Make
a directory entry that points to the existing (old) kernal. Once that is
done, then another util in that package called "krnlmvr" or maybe "krnlmvr.09"
will go get the patched one and copy it over the existing one. One caveat,
they MUST be on different disks because I used "KERNEL" for the hard-coded
name of both files. Yeah, I know, shame on me, I shouldn't have done it
that way. ALSO when you were patching the kernal file you've made, did you
add the few bytes on the tail of os9p1 BEFORE telling kwikpatch to patch it?
If not, then the jump table (thats what those last few bytes are) will not
be correct, crash city. The reworked file must be exactly $1200 bytes long.

Ded can pad the whole thing, but not an individual module in a merged file
like os9boot. For that, you need Chris Burkes "EzGen" about 1.11 or so. It
has an "x" function wherein you "l"ink to the module, then "xn"where n is
the number of bytes to stretch it. After some disk grinding to move the rest
of the file down by n bytes, its relinked into one file. This does modify
the length in the module header too, and a "V" then run thru the whole thing
fixing any bad header parity bytes and module crc's. I used it on Init a few
times here to adjust the position of everything beyond it. Best blob fix
I've done yet. Do it one byte at a time till the blob is gone. You might
have to add 3 bytes total before its fixed in my experience.

I doubt that RBF.32 is the LHA problems. I've been using it here since I
uploaded it, along with LHA2.2 (I think thats the latest level 2 version)
and have not had a single instance of a malfunction that I could attribute
to LHA. Using lzh on an lha file wil puke of course, so I keep both handy
just yet, too many things here that were smunched with Matts lzh to delete
it yet.
Off the top oif my head, I'd almost bet its a blob related problem, can you
format a floppy disk without any errors? Thats the first test  for the blob.
BTW, the RBF from 1.15 is (as is the 1.16 version as far as I can tell from
my dis-mantleing of them) is/was based on the stock ed 28, not on Kevs ed 30.
Mine is based on ed 30 but nativized and also has the archive byte patch the
canadien fellow (name slips my mind right now) had proposed we use. It has
no effect on the operation of rbf in any way UNTIL it needs the 48th segment
allocation for a file. The fix for that is that if you know a big file is
coming in, like over 100k, have dmode set the sas up to FF before the dl os
is started. That way the segment list won't get used up until the file is
multimegabyte in size.
If there is a problem with RBF.32 that can be pinned down to RBF.32, everyone
PLEASE let me know.

Welp... Zmodem was originally written on big, fast computers with

But ymodem (on Supercomm) sends files with an average speed of 400+CPS
(at 4800)... I thought Zmodem was supposed to be superior to ymodem.

Sure, it isa superior _protocal_, but the current implementation on
the CoCo is not written as effeciently as existing CoCo ymodem routines...
Whats needed is for someone to write Zmodem routines for the CoCo from scratch,
that way it can be written cleanly from the start.

Well...yes, but:

1. zmodem is a "sliding windows" protocol, which means that the receiver
   has to be able to write the packet it just received to disk while the
   next packet is coming in.

2. Like the original poster said, the author of rz/sz wrote it for Unix,
   and it doesn't do things one would definitely want to do under OS-9,
   like notice how many bytes are ready to read and get them all at once
   to minimize system call overhead.  It would take some work to modify
   or maintain rz/sz--it has many conditional compilation directives to
   work on various flavors of Unix.  A couple of places in the source
   appear unaffected by the "structured programming" movement of the
   late 60s and early 70s.

One correction James, Zmodem DOES check to see how many characters are
pending, and reads what is available, up to what it needs.

My last forum message regarding your insurance bet algorithm needs a
slight modification.

Dealer's upcard is ace

Players can make insurance bet

Dealer looks at hole card

If dealer does not have 21, players lose insurance bets and play continues
in normal way with players taking more cards if they want

If dealer has 21, players win insurance bets; if player has 21, it's a
"push" or tie with regard to original bet and player gets original bet
back; if player does not have 21, then player loses original bet (dealer
automatically wins)

Thats great!  What games are you talking about?  I believe that there

correctly, I had some pretty colorful crashes until I updated
cc3io.nv115 to nv116.  Check the docs for NitrOS9 1.16 to see

It depends on exactly what you mean by that statement.  IF you mean that you
are going to remove the
full height drives and replace them with half height drives, then full speed
ahead!  IF on the other hand you mean to take a hacksaw and slice a little off,
some would tell yo to go ahead as there would be one less of the power sucking
full height drives left to deal with in this world.  I being more forgiving will

tell you to just keep them as a spare and get a couple of half heights to
replace
them.
Depending on the case you are installing the half heights in, you may need a new

faceplate for the drives.  These are usually available from the distributor of
the drives.  If you can't locate the full height faceplates for the half height
drives and you really need them, these can often be picked up at computer flea
markets and festivals. Happy computing!

The faceplates (and the locking mechanism) would be the holdup.  Otherwise
the other half seems to be just a spacer; perhaps, tho, the extra room is
needed for heat dissipation - these are older 720k drives with a bunch

get/build a case and power supply for the bigger drives.

I have ran both KQ3 and Interbank Indident from a HD system... They both
took some work... First off, they both need a VDG screen to run on (having
windint in the boot wont hurt, but you do need vdgint) also, KQ3 will not
run if you are operating in 1 or 2 meg mode (it does nasty GIME tricks)
Also, KQ3 required a patch to the stock init module. It has been a very long
time since I ran either, so I casn't give you much more specifics.

Dunno about Interbank Incident, but I am sure that KQ3 is a VDG window based
app, therefore, WindInt is not used by it, but VDGint is.

KQ III, Flightsim(2), and several other games use VDGINT instead of WindInt.

It is OK to have both WintInt and VDGInt in your boot at the same time.  You
also need a couple or so modules from the bootfile in the KQ disk (AGIVirq,
for one), also FS2 has some modules, too.  There is (or was) a file here
called "vrn.ar" (I think it was .ar).  It included replacements for the KQ and
FS-2 modules.  You might give this a try.

If you want the stock stuff, if you don't have a bootsplit program to extract
modules from a bootfile, you might make a backup of your game disk, edit the
startup file to _NOT_ start up KQ, and then save them to disk.  There is a
copy of save in with one of the commands that came in the Multi-View package.
In either case, grab any module you do not recognize.

One other thing... If you haven't done it, you need to change a byte in the
stock "init" module.  The byte at offset $000C should be changed from $0F
to $0C, and the module's CRC should be updated.

Hope this helps.

It's not the declaration of caseFunc that's the problem, it's the
use.  Try "(*caseFunc)('a');" and see if you have any better luck.

Hi everybody.  I own a CoCo 3 that I just started using again after about 3

I do own OS-9.  But I don't have anything for the system (OS9 that is).  I've

it, what are its uses, and where can one get a copy of it?  I have a CoCo 3 with

DMP-106 printer, and 1200 baud modem.  Are there any suggestions for upgrades
or purchases in order to catch up with the times?  I would really like to use
my computer to do some hardware interfacing, and would like to basically get

The references you have been seeing on "nitrOS9" is to a chip  that uses it!
ked hitachi to make a CMOS version of the 6809...
The ORG 6809 chip was hard coded internaly........The CMOS version used
what is known as Microcode....literly programming the CPU to do what you
want.......Anyway,someone noticed that there was a LOT more room in there
and without the knowlege of Motorola put some extra goodies in there!
 the   E  and  F   registers  8 bit   W combines them.....
      The Q register is ALL of Em!   the D and W = Q   32 bits
 a STATUS register........etc....It is a drop in replacement for the 68B09E
 HD63C09E is it!    BUT! some programs do not like it,as a couple of OP codes
 WILL cause problems due to sloppy programmers........
 anyway when this news came out a couple of programmers got to work on upgrading

OS-9 level II to use its faster format......Hence NitrOS9....and you can add
  POWER BOOST from B & B.........dig around in the Database for the ORG
6309 MEMO on the changes! or if you have a copy of EDASM around it can be
UPGRADED to work with the new chip! of course you have to have one ! That
entails removing the CoCo-3 CPU which is soldered in place,remove and replace
with
 a socket....This brings up another item....a 2 meg add on for the CoCo-3
 using SIMM,s.......I have one of the old ones that used TWO boards...this
one uses ONE and will run without extra power...that you get from DISTO here!
if he has any left! Working with Os9 I would recomend having EZGEN from B & B
worth the $20.00 for it! makes Bootfiles without the hair pulling one had
to go through in the early days<ARggg> there is another one also out there
from Canada....they both do the same thing..B & B uses the disk..the other
uses memory to build the bootfile.......+ other things........
Hope this helps to bring you up to speed....RGB-DOS...<hard drive system>
and B & B are still around .....if you want hard drive .....there was a
note here on that the other day!

     Sony Service Anecdote
     From: MARTYGOODMAN To: ALL

Folks,
     I just had an interesting chat with a VERY kind and helpful
customer service person for Sony Corp.  The situation was that I had
acquired a particular Sony television, without its remote control, and
was seeking to know whether the remote was necessary to program which
channels it saw when you used the up and down channel control. I was
also seeking to know what particular remote controls made either by Sony
or by others ("universal remote controls") supported the functions
needed to do such programming.   We quickly ascertained that this
particular Sony TV (KV20TS30, vintage 1991) ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED its
particular make and model of remote control (Sony part number RM-761) to
acess those features.  NOTHING else would do.  This part was available,
for $30.00 plus $5.00 shipping costs.  Well and good.
     I then happenned to mention to the fellow that I was interested in
buying a SERVICE manual for that television.  He asked me if I did not
mean "user manual", not "service manaual", and I assured him that I
wanted a service manual, for I occasionally did repairs on my own
consumer electronics products.  I told him a story about how I had
diagnosed and fixed TWO older Sony TVs I owned (one was a KV1311CR,
popular with Color Computer 3 and Amiga users because it doubled as a
decent quality RGB analog monitor that accepted 15.75 KHz H sync RGB
analog video signals and had a very nice display) that had lost the
ability to remember what channels they were to see and what to lock out,
due to the failure of their EEPROM chip.  I noted how kind and helpful
Sony parts had been in getting me, at rasonable prices, the needed
service manuals AND the required oddball EEPROM chip for the TVs in
questions.
     The customer service person proceeded to say that I was probably
now FLAGGED in Sony's parts order line computer as "knowledgeable about
how to fix TV's".  I suggested he was kidding.  "No," he said, "they
actually DO at Sony parts as a matter of policy try to ascertain whether
the caller knows what he or she is talking about".  And IF they are
convinced the called DOES know what end of a soldering iron to grab hold
of, they apparantly NOTE that in the record, for future reference!  How
interesting!   It makes perfect sense to me that they should do that,
and I applaud Sony for its support of those who know how to and prefer
to try fixing their own consumer electronic equipment.   I find the fact
that they subtly attempt to screen callers to the parts department a
perfectly sensible, reasonable policy on their part.  It's just amusing
to KNOW now that they do it. I do in fact highly recommend Sony consumer
electronic products in general, and their Televisions and RGB Monitors
in particular.  These seem to be of the very highest quality, of

Hi Marty. The news about Sony's helpful attitude on their products sounds
wonderful. I have this Sony Model SRD2040A 40 meg hard drive. Wonder how
to go about getting this running for COCO3. I have no cables or power
supply. Sound like a teaser eh? Must go from scrtch. Thanks for any
help. CLT

NONE of my hard drive references list SONY as a maker of hard drives!
I've checked in three different hard drive guides.  I called a friend
who also has never  heard of Sony brand drives.   Bear in  mind
the references I'm using are pretty extensive.   So... it would
SEEM to me that you've got a drive that has been RELABELED
by Sony, as opposed to one they MADE.   Or such is my speculation.

  What more can you tell me about this drive? Is it MFM?  Where did
it come from?  What physical size is it?

   What sort of hard drive host adaptor and controller are you
planning to use with this "Sony" drive?  I assume you are aware
that 95% of the cost and difficulty of hooking a hard drive to
a CoCo 3 is the host adaptor / controller and software...
the hard drive itself is usually the cheapest and most trivial
aspect of the the system.

Interesting!!  Suggestions are welcome.  Solutions are VERY welcome.  It is
odd that the shell used makes a difference.  Actually this would not be the
first problem we encountered with a replacement MM/1 module.  Early versions
of a module called Cal's Math would error on a course of 0 or 180.  This was
mentioned to the author and later math modules worked properly with the
BASIC09 math requirements.  It was something about the carry bit that had
not been handled the way BASIC09 required.
  Anyway, thanks for the information.  It will be checked out and we will
see about developing a version that works with both shells.

     A basic09 dir compare
     From: WDTV5        To: ALL

I saw, about a week ago, a msg go by where someone was reading in filenames
in a basic09 routine, and wondering why it would never compare, even if the
names looked alike, they miss-compared and his program then miss-behaved.
I recall looking at the code as it flew by and noting that in doing the
compare, the code shown did the toupper function ok, but did NOT have any
provision to handle the fact that as it comes off the disk, the first bit
in the last character of the name is set high. In order for the compare to
find them equal when they are, the code should strip that bit, and then
terminate the string with a basic09 "end of string" marker, an $FF hex.
Whoever that was, give it a try after plugging in the code to handle that
and I'll bet it'll work as you intended. Cheers, Gene

 Hi Gene, that was me who posted that. Thanks for the reply, I have your
 message saved for later referal.
 Anyway, when I got the filename(s) from disk, the program includes the
 conversion routine which subtracts 128 from the last character. Shouldn't this
 do the trick? And if I do Eos, won't that still make it unequal, as the last
character won't match?

I didn't intend to indicate the last byte (char) of the name was to be made
into an $FF, but the next one after that. A $FF is Basic09's end of string
marker unlike C's $00 eos marker. I didn't see that sub 128 in the code
snippet I saw go by. It may have been there, but I always check to see if
the first bit is set, and "LAND(char,127)" ((check that syntax please))
rather than subbing the 128. Does less to the carry bits or something, but
works for me. Lemme open a window and check one chunk of code I've got that
does exactly that. Yeah, here is that snippet.

WHILE NOT(EOF(#Dpath)) DO
GET #Dpath,temp1
TName:=""
FOR x=1 TO 29
BT:=ASC(MID$(temp1,x,1))
IF BT>64 AND BT<95 THEN
BT:=BT+32
ENDIF
EXITIF BT>127 THEN
BT:=LAND(BT,127)
IF BT>64 AND BT<95 THEN
BT:=BT+32
ENDIF
TName:=TName+CHR$(BT)
ENDEXIT
EXITIF BT=0 THEN
ENDEXIT
TName:=TName+CHR$(BT)
NEXT x

and that is how I load in the directory entries in my own personal MaxIc.
Its probably re-inventing the wheel tho.  Cheers, Gene

     Formats.ar

Can anyone tell me how to modify the B09 source code for Formats? It's in the
databases as FORMATS.AR a bulk disk formatter that whistles at you when it
finishes formatting a disk and is ready for another. I want it to use /d1 and
/d2 instead of /d0 and /d
1. I tried replacing all occurances of /d0 with /d1 and /d1 with /d2 but it
doesn't seem to work. I get the fomtatting message but then I get the "put your
system master back in /dd if it's a floppy..." and Hit any Key. Then I get get
my prompt back when I
 hit a key. It updates the       /dd/sys/volid file so I know that part works an
d I
had format in memory at the time too. I know next to nothing about basic09 so
any and all help would be greatly appreciated!

Is there a faster way of setting the pointer to the end of a sequetial

WHILE NOT(EOF(#filepath)) DO

However, on a large file this takes forever.  Is there a way to set

Yep, it's not that big of a deal. using syscall, Do a Getstat SS.Siz call
on the file path, followed up by a Seek call.

  .....
 TYPE regs: cc,a,b,dp:byte;x,y,u:integer
 dim s1:regs
 ...
 s1.a=file_path
 s1.b=2
 RUN syscall($8D,s1)
 /* s1.x and s1.u now have the file size. I$Seek takes the same format
 RUN syscall($88,s1)

Yup.  You need to look up the SS_SIZE getstat, and read up on using
the syscall procedure.  That will let you find the size and seek directly
to the end.

Dear friends:
How do you use either AR or LHA to create an archive that contains sub-

         ./CMDS/Program
         ./docs

etc.  I want the archive to "self-install."

As is normally the case with OS9, there are many ways to skin this cat. My
personal fav is to build a file that contains all of the pathlists you want
archived. Then use the stdin option of ar like this:

  list files ! ar -uz archive.ar

 I'm sure LHA has a like feature, but I only have the osk version. Oh, and for
this to work, all pathlists in the file much start from the same point that
ar is started at.

I don't think there are any utilities to format IBM disks on the Co

PCDos, here in the database will copy files to and from IBMPC disks.

I just buy formatted diskettes at the store since I don't have an IBM

I hate to tell you this, but there isn't such an animal for OS-9. There IS,
however, a utility written in DECB that will do what you want... almost.
Marty Goodman wrote such a program for Rainbow in June or July of 1987.
The program formats a SINGLE SIDED IBM compatible disk under Disk Basic. He
stuck with SS because not that many DECB people had DS drives at the time.
It does go 40 tracks though. It is in the Rainbow on Tape section. You might
ask Marty about it directly in mail though.
You could possibly use this as the basis for an OS-9 program. If you do, let
me know-- it would make a great magazine feature! When I run such things in
"68' micros", the author retains copyright, just gives me permission to
print!
