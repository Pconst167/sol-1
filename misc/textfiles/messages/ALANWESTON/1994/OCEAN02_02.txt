  Warren, does the 68340 upgrade for the MM/1 have a sound driver yet?
Last I heard it didn't.  Even if it doesn't I'd like to get one. 
Any details?

Stephen,
      According to David Graham, Blackhawk Ent., he has someone
committed to redoing the sound driver for the M68340.  I don't know when 
it will be released however.

Warren,
    I am using the Kterm with a Pratical Peripherals PM14400FXMT. I gets
pretty good speeds. When I call a good bbs system. The Dutchess is a good
one and over long distance Kterm shows about 1100-1150 bytes/sec. When I
call an older slower bbs(even local) I only get about 900 bps. That would be 
using Y-Modem Batch. The DTE speed is set to 38,400 on /T3 port. DTE is at
14400.

Paul, 
      Are you using V.42b error control or none ?
