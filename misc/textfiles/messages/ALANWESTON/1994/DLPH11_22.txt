Hi all,
        After all the discussion of CDI here I figure I better get
around to asking what kind of files are on a CDI disk? I do have a
CD reader hooked to my MM1 and Chris Hawk's utility to copy from
CDI. Are there sound files (iff) on those CDI disks that I could
bring to my MM1 HD and play? Are there images on those disks that
could be displayed on the MM1? I might go buy a CDI disk just to
explore .....

Greetings All!

  I'm looking for a few brave souls to beta-test the first release of my new
CDRom File Manager (CDF). It works fine with all the utilities I've thrown
at it (dir, copy, attr, load (<from CD-i discs>). And I need someone(s)
to wring it old real good!

  You need:

  An OSK based computer.
  a 33c93A SCSI controller chip (like the MM/1)
  an NEC SCSI CDRom reader (others may work, maybe not)

  I will supply the File Manger and descriptor. If you have the CDRom reader
then you probably have the driver (rbvccs and scsi_mm1d vr #27). If not, I can
supply them too.

  Send me E-Mail if you are willing to try it out.

  To whet your appetites, here is a dir of a CD-i disc:( 7th Guest )

I might, IF it was a ring-ding. The VT500FT is a 4 stroker, 2 cyls on 54
degree angle with the crankpins offset 52 degrees. Kinda like a mini harley
but without the vibs. 2 plugs per hole, 4 valves from one cam per head.
" cv carbs=2, and fuel flow is gravity but just barely, it starves once
in a while at speed & I have to loosen the tank cap which does NOT have
a gasket, not since some monkeys stole it and pipe-wrenched the orig gas
cap off. so's they could ride it to the next 7-11 they were sticking up.
Finally got caught in Batltimore (Baltimore) and threw it in the bushes,
at which point the cops gave it back to us, as is! It now has a pinto gas
cap/flange in the top of the tank, & I haven't even painted around the
blistered paint from silver soldering all that into it. I mean, this is
an original "rat" bike! About 17k miles is all, so the walls s/b good.
I need to pull both plugs at once so I can see but they are about as
close to impossible to remove as theyc come, buried even deeper than
an old hemi mopar was.  Takes 2 different sockets as each has its own
clearance probs to the top edge of the socket vs the access port in the
heads. Next summer maybe, in the meantime its under a roof for the winter.
Its taken me 2 years just to get the jets cleaned enough to actually
go out on the interstate without leaning out at 40 mph. Took a can of
injector cleaner, the kind you add 1/2 of to a 20 gal tank if they're
real dirty, only I put 1/2 the bottle in 2 gals & took it for a run out
of gas ride. Worked wonders! Saving the other half bottle for next time.
Right now, its problem is that it simply won't crank when hot, and it
has absolutley no provision for a kick starter lever anyplace. If the
battery won't, then you're dead right there because the clutch won't
hold well enough to push it once the plates are opened letting the oil
in between them again. Oil could be a prob, its 5w40 Castrol, but its
not THAT old, fresh last spring and <1k miles on it.

     The  clutch  is easy, it is the oil! Modern multi-vis oil is
_way_  to  slick for an oil bath clutch. These oils save fuel  by
being 'runny', and get their summer ratings with exceptional film
strength rather than simple viscosity.
     Good  film=bad clutch, and the hotter the bike the worse the
problem.   Racing  clutches (at least in the 70s) had  very  hard
plates   and ran in straight 30 (or 50) weight oil. Street  bikes
got away with 10w40, but this was the old 10w40, not a super oil.

     Hot    start  thought-  not enviourmentally correct, but you
might  try a leaded additive (Klotz 'Real Lead' or similar- not a
simple octane booster)
     Would  go a long way to keeping the top end lubed for a  hot
start-   and  you  could  probably  skip  a  few  tanks   between
treatments,  till  the lead deposits wore off the cylinder  walls
again.

Oil in the plug holes works for poor compression on anything. I'm at least
vaguely familiar with the VT500... a friend had one with a water pump leak!
Gasket got hard with age and it is a bit** to change! Just pull
motor.... Anyway, you might simply try pulling and really cleaning those
carbs. What you did was a quick fix, they really need a proper cleaning this
winter!! That might be unrelated to your starting problem though.

Well, yes I spose. They was soaked in Yammies recommended cleaner for
about a month a year ago, without any real effect. One has a busted
diaphram, but I've been patching those with a rubberised type winshield
sealer and saran wrap, the sealer holds the saran wrap in place for
years! This isn't my first go-round with cv carbs, I date back into
the early '70's and the old CB-350 twin on those. Now there was a hot rod!
38 ponies outta 350 cc, 11k redline (& a 15k miles crank too, all roller)
Wasn't paying much attention one morning, had 140lb son on back, pulled out
behind northbound truck doing around 60 & darned near ran us under him
before I got outta 2nd! But all good things must end, and I found somebody
who wanted to administer the coo-de-ta on the crank for $200, so I let
him.  Those carbs both had the saran wrap patches, response was instant
even so.

Gene,

Another 2 cents worth I will add is to make sure that the gasoline you are
using is high octane.  Todays' lower octane fuels burn hotter and longer
raising cylinder and head temps.  Rick's advice about the lead additives also
addresses this.  If I were you, I would run the highest octane fuel I could
find.  Retarding timing very slightly to shorten the burn time might provide a
clue that this is the problem.

I had always been told that the fuel was adequate IF there wasn't any
pre-ignition knock at the std spark advance setting.  I don't have any,
even with a tank of 87 octane and 20 miles on the since startup clock.
I have used some high test just for comparisons & in this one, there

Gene,

The absence of pre-ignition knock at the std spark advance setting was the
criterion for leaded fuels, but today's gasoline chemicals react differently
than tetra-ethyl lead did.  As I stated in my last post, gasoline today is
formulated to burn hotter and LONGER to try to reduce unwanted emissions from
the exhaust.  The Japanese and Chrysler Corp. in the U.S. developed the "lean
burn" engine design in the 80s which consisted of a conical combustion chamber
designed to extend the length of the "burn" cycle in the 4 cycle engine.
Gasoline was redesigned at that time to accommodate this design change
replacing tetra-ethyl lead with a gaggle of chemicals designed to lengthen the
"burn" time of the fuel.  This change resulted in fewer emissions from the
tailpipe, higher gas mileage AND higher head temperatures due to the extended
length of the combustion phase.  In addition, as Rick Ulland has pointed out,
gone also is the lubricity of tetra-ethyl lead which used to coat the valves
and valve stems, spark plugs and everything else in the combustion chamber.
Since the "burn" cycle is longer, and since the fuel octane is lower, the
initial combustion of the fuel (ignition) takes place at a higher temperature.
 Thus, there will be no "pre-ignition" in most cases.  The engine just runs
much hotter.  Pre-ignition was caused because higher octane fuels would ignite
due to the heat developed from compression alone when the combustion chamber
temperatures or glowing tetra-ethyl lead deposits were heated beyond the
ignition "flash" point before the spark actually occurred. This condition is
much more rare today because there is no lead, and the effective octane of
gasoline is significantly lower.

I am an air-cooled Volkswagen nut, so I am very well educated regarding the
effects of today's new fuels on small air cooled engines.  The two significant
measures for reducing excessive head temperatures and preventing premature
wear on valves and valve guides due to high temperatures are:   to use at
least the octane rating of fuel for which the engine was designed (in the case
of the air-cooled VW that is 91 [ I use 93]), and to use one of the new
super-lubricating oils such as the synthetic Castrol "Syntec" or adding a
super-lubing additive such as Dura-lube (the best) or Slick 50.  (I use both
Syntec oil and Dura-lube in my engines - outstanding performance and mileage.)
  Retarding the ignition timing slightly may also help, but is far less
desirable due to loss of performance in a small engine.

To summarize, every motorist should take advantage of the new "molecular
bonding" oil formulations, because they not only lower operating temps, but
also sharply reduce engine wear which is greatest at startup before the oil
has circulated through the engine.  This applies doubly for cold weather
operation. Not everyone should use higher octane gasoline, however.  If your
engine was designed for the new lower octane gasolines, you may experience
reduced gas mileage, may see very little difference in performance and
effectively throw money away using higher octanes.

Wow!  Got carried away, but there it is.  All you ever wanted to know, but
never asked.<grin>

Cheers to you, Gene.

Bill , I guess all these new oil additives and formulation is why
I have a hard time keeping my recently rebuilt 1963 Rambler engine from using
much oil! In the summer, it is bad! Run a little hard (like cruising interstate
at 70) and it uses about a quart in 500 miles, running 10w40. 20w50 isn't
much better. Around town and in winter consumption is a more reasonable 1000
miles to a quart.

     Interesting  you'd  mention that 350, since the XL I was  so
found  of was essentially that engine, sawed in half and stuck in
a  200lb  bike.  The new 185 made more ponies than the  250  that
year-  Rocker  arms and springs and the dang thing  pulled  right
through it's 11K shift that I sometimes missed. (BTW, that old CB
clutch holds up alot better with half the motor...6 @ $2.43 sound
familair?)
     Cracked a case, seized a big end, and found the wonder crank
was  a  non-repairable $200 part, spun balanced at 30000rpm in  a
secret  labratory  near Osaka. And mine was the $mall one.  Ain't
technology wonderful?

     Excellent   text,   but   one caution- bikes often  use  the
engine  oil  as clutch coolant! Under no circumstances  should  a
'Slick50' type additive be used with an oil bath clutch! Doing so
is  an invitation for repeated clutch failure until all that crap
finally rinses out 20 plates down the road..

yeah, seemed to me the 350 crank was being quoted at the $375 level plus
installation to match. I opted for a 350 4 instead at the time, not near the
power, and a continuous oil leak for a head gasket. But I tossed my leg
over it the first time at the 31k miles mark, 14 months later I handed the
keys to the next owner, made $50 on the deal, and the clock said 57k miles!
Like I said, I used it as a chair car (with air conditioning, even in 10"
of freash snow. Ahh, those were a little closer to my "salad days", immortal
and all that. I recall one frosty morning headed over FreyDonnier pass out
of SusanVille, headed for Chester ca, middle of a big 3 lanes each way
sweeper, left peg an inch off the deck leaning into a serious sidewind.
At apex of corner, 9k in 3rd gear, the wind switched sides. I put that peg
into the blacktop and used all three lanes on my side and 2 on the other
side, but I saved it! Things like that make ya think yer the best, and
then 5 years back I throw away a GS1000G missing a deer at 30 mph and
break a rib, collecting $500 worth of road rash too. Oh, and $300 for
new glasses, couldn't find more than s sliver or so of the old lenses.
All told, I figure I've probably hit the 500,000 mile mark on 2 wheels
over tha last 45+ years of riding. One busted rib, one broken ankle,
lost track of tha hard hats etc tho.

for inputs. (or change at will) I do not know if the speed would be enough
to make it truely bi-directional since it would take three pokes to the
PIA to change it from output <=> input. (ok three store commands for
assembly users)

as for a parellel modem, making a driver would be easy since you have no
baud rates and probably no parity and such. Ive never seen these modems
so I couldn't comment on how feasable it would be.

The only problem I have with PPIA is it doesn't sense for #246 errors,
that would be easy to patch in, the driver is rather simple.

     PGP ver 2.6.2
     From: MARTYGOODMAN To: ALL

In the Color Computer SIG data base, in the GENERAL section, is
a 14K long text file I just wrote that gives the history of the PGP
public RSA encryption software, AND tells you how to use Delphi
(assuming you are at a site in the USA) to obtain a copy of the latest
(and now legal) release of PGP, version 2.6.2.     (You do have to
be a member of the Internet SIG, with acess to FTP and Telnet capabilities
of Delphi.)

While PGP is available only for the PC compatible and Macintosh platforms,
there IS available from the same FTP site that has the program
SOURCE CODE for the program, which might allow OS68K types to port
it to their machines.

If you can supply me with the mgs number it would help greatly.

If U can believe it I get the same thing with the old shell too. It must
have something to do with memory boundaries. I start with 344k free, no
work, if I add a module and get around 272k free no problem. Also, if

Interesting.  In that case, the info in 90625 probably won't help fix
the problem.  Hope you get it figured out, tho.

I'll keep at it. But I think my system is bad.  Do you know if we have

It could be that the "-" key is not working properly.

     Signals in UCC
     From: PAGAN        To: ALL

 I recently posted a request for information re the signal() and
 _os_intercept() functions in UCC.  Here's what I learned:

 It's not necessary to _os_sigmask() unless you need to clear or increnment
 the signal mask.

 To second parameter should be _glob_data which is initialized in cstart just
 for this purpose.  Microware overlooked this in it's documentation :-)

 The process becomes:

    void SignalCatcher(sig)
    int sig;
    {
    /* process the signal */
    _os_rte()
    }

    main(argc,argv)
    int argc;
    char *argv[];
    {
    extern void *_glob_data;

    _os_intercept(SignalCatcher,_glob_data);
    }

 BTW, using debug it looks like _os_intercept has less overhead than the old
 intercept() function in the 3.2 compiler.

 Thank for the information goes to Peter Dibble, A.B. Cohen Stuart and
 Ruediger Nahm-Elstner (PEP Modular Computers).

I don't remember having the problem with multiboot but when I have
Stack Overflow errors they can be corrected usually by specifing
more memory on the command line.  Try multiboot#16k or multiboot#32k
for example.

     mini expansion bus
     From: WAYNETHOMPSO To: DISTO

Tony,
  I am thinking about building a PIA based parallel port using
the mini expansion bus in my SC2.  My question involves the Chip Enable
 __
(CE) pin [#13].  What state is this pin in when address $FF50 is selected
on the coco bus?  I think that it would be low, but I want to make sure.
I plan to map the pia into $FF50-FF53.  I am using Mike Guzzi's PPIA.AR
as a guideline.  In that file he decodes the pia into $FF70-$FF73 and
builds a separate pak to plug in his MPI. After studying his guidelines
I started looking at my SC2's MEB since it is already decoded and should
be relatively easy to use for the project and end up saving a slot on my
MPI to boot!
  To clarify, let me restate the question:
 When $FF50 is shown on the coco bus, what is the state of pin 13
( chip enable) of the MEB?
Thanks,
Wayne

The Chip Enable pin of the mini bus on a SCII is normally HI and when the CPU
does a read/write the pin goes LO. From what I read in your message, it should
work just fine. -Tony.

Help!

I've been trying to compile Palm 2.2 and have been unsuccessful.  This
is on a 3-Meg MM1 using the compiler that shipped with the machine.  The
following is the error output I get from the compiler after running MAKE
with "makefile.osk."

The following is the beginning of the makefile that I'm using:

**************************************************************************
* Makefile for Palm v2.1 - OS-9/68K Version
*   Jeff Shepler - 10/93

** Choose which UUCP package you are using:
** RICK - Rick Adams' UUCP package version 4.2 (or lower??)
** BOB - Bob Billson's UUCP package version 2.0

** Note that this makefile is constructed for Ultra C
** Minimal changes are needed for GCC and MW C V3.2

_UUCP = BOB

CC = cc
RDIR = .
ODIR = /dd/cmds
NEWLIBS = -l=/dd/lib/termlib.l -l=/dd/lib/clib.l -l=/dd/lib/sys.l
CFLAGS = -I -d$(_UUCP) -d_OSK -v=.
LFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) $(NEWLIBS) -M=8k


If the linker can't find "strtok," "strchr," and "_envrion," what do
I have to do to compile the program???

As it is, one portion of the source code - termio.c - generates several
screenfuls of errors and warnings.  John Donaldson was kind enough to
send me his version of termio.c which appears to be much better.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Better yet, if someone can
email me just the executable, that would be enough for me.

Looks like you're compiling code that is expecting ANSI C library routines
(strtok, strchr).  Your options:

1. get Ultra C
2. see if someone else has written an ANSI C library you could use
3. roll your own ANSI C library

Boisy,

Well, I've been told I need os9lib.l.  As for compiling Palm for OSK,
it just won;t happen on my MM1.  James Jones replied to I forum
message that I left here several days ago with the error output from
the compile.  He said that unresolved references such as
strtok, strchr, and _environ mean that the program was written for ANSI C
and as such require an ANSI compiler or Ultra C. I have neither.

If you can compile the source with C 3.2, then it means you have something
compiler-wise that I don't.

Might mean that there's some macro one can define to conditionally compile
either for ANSI or for pre-ANSI.  (I'm just guessing at all this, since I
haven't seen the source.)

    Easy! It repeats the lies I told it to tell the user! Actually the only
valid bit is 'directory' I have it lying and setting ewr (both public and
private) in all MSDog files. When I get my CD reader back from the shop ( I
found out that I was getting random single-bit errors when I was able to load
cdi (os9) files. The system reported CRC errors).) I'll have it report the

     Memory Shortage
     From: 2NIBBLES     To: ALL

  Sometime, long ago--I read some cocolist mail concerning someone's
homebrew 2 Meg simm board for their CoCo. I just happen to have 2 Meg's
worth of 256 X 8 simms laying around, and would like to fabricate an
adapter board for MY CoCo. In order to prepare for this task, I ordered
NEC's Memory data book from JDR Microdevices out here in CA, and now have
a pinout for these simms, but I DONT have a schematic that I'll certainly
need in order to assemble the desired memory board. I could make a 512k
board easily, but if some very kind CoCo-ist out there would oblige me, I
will assemble a 1 or 2 Meg board that I would much prefer. At this moment
I have sockets, memory, a suitable protoboard, a little time, much desire,
a lot of patience, and much hope.

     Please, someone HELP!! I'd very much appreciate it, and if an SASE and
some valuable consideration within the means of the typical married CoCo-nuts
limited budget will help, I'm game.

   Long-winded, happy, one taco short of a combination plate and 2NIBBLES

Let's see...no, that hasn't happened to me, but when I run ix, I do get
tossed into boldface mode.  That happens because I claim to Delphi that
I'm a vt100, which is convenient for using their nn newsreader, but

It sounds like you are getting line noise. Is your Modem Error Correcting?
If not, this might be your trouble..  I've experienced the same thing,
but not lately, maybe since I went to error-correcting modems.  I suspect
it is little low-volume noises that don't show up when you are getting
activity, not sure.

I, too, have a "B" version.. I suppose the "C" is supposed to be a CMOS
version, which consumes less power.  Then I heard that all 6309 chips
are CMOS, so I dunno..  I'd just go with the flow  <G>.

Yeah, I know what you mean..  If they are persistent, and you don't
have an error-correcting modem, if you could borrow one to try, might
help you see if it is line noise.

OH, I just remembered, I had a modem one time, a Smart Team (NOT Smart
One), and it began sending garbage... I cursed my phone co to no end,
but found out it was the modem.  Could be your problem, too.  I'd
try another modem..  If another modem cleared up your problem, you might
try your modem at a location that was not getting errors and see if the
garbage occurred there. If so, then it would look like the modem was bad.

James,

I have a CoCo III and an MS-DOG machine, and I tell Delphi that I am a VT-100
too.  I don't have IX for the CoCo, but I use Win-DLite on the DOG.  The DOG
also goes into boldface and large characters in Win-D sometimes after a mail
response and sometimes after a forum response.  I would guess Delphi's VAXes
are getting a character sequence that makes them burp.

Any opinions out there?

Hi Tim,
  In this CoCo 3, which is one of three or four, is a HD63B09EP not a
6809.  I saw a refference to a 63c09 processor and wanted to know the
difference between it and my HD63B09EP.  I replaced the MC68B09E Mot-
orola processor in 1992. That is when I entered in my logbook.  Just
in case the next four messages to me say the same thing, I want to make
it clear on that point.  I have a logbook in my dd/sys directory that
I use to keep a record of any and all modifications, whether hardware
or software.  This way if I need to have a certain modification done
in order to make a wanted modification, I can see in my log if I have
done it or not.  Or, I can use it to see if a wanted modification is
going to be in conflict with one I have done in the past.
  About that noise, I have come to the conclusion that what you say
may be true in my case.  I have noticed that if I log off and log back
on that this will help in most cases.  I am having no problem with it
right now in this session.  I did switch back to my Disto RS232 Pak.
Thank you for the reply, Tim.  See ya.

P.S.  Oh yeah, one more thing.  Is there any reason you can think of
as to why I am losing my cursor when I leave MAIL?  I am using OSTerm
Version 2.08 and have been for the last four years.  Going into MAIL
is the last thing I do before logging off, obviously since a cursor
is a neccessity.  See ya.

Hi James,
  Long time no speak.  I think the last time was when Paul Ward was still
logging in.  Anyway, I have never had a problem with BOLDFACE characters,
only the infamous disappearing cursor.  I have come up with a quicky cure
for it, I do MAIL just before I log off.  Oh, I am using OSTerm V2.08 and
terminal set to VT-100.  I do have a small startup file that does some
palette manipulation before firing up OSTerm.  Makes the colors better. I
cannot see where that will have any bearing.  I will have to consult my
logbook to see if I have applied any patches to OSTerm.  Cannot remember
off hand.  I guess that is why I have a logbook of my modifications. Well
gotta go, I think I have one more message to reply to.  Thanks for the

No, there are 63b09's.  That's what mine is.  I was surprised that it
WAS a "B".  But it is a 6309, because it accepts 6309 codes, or at least
it works with PowerBoost.  It was my understanding that all 6309's WERE
CMOS, so not sure.  I wonder if any are labeled as "C"?

Hi David,
  Well, I can tell you that I have learned the difference between the

I got a few replys that explained it to me.  Anyway, I have come up

I log off Delphi.  As for the random characters, I think it may well

Those letters indicate the highest clock rate that the manufacturer is
willing to guarantee the chips work at.  B indicates 2 MHz, C 3 MHz.
Yes, all 6309s are CMOS...which is why they suck down a LOT less current
than the 6809s and thus run way cooler.

Yes, I saw them.. and I learned, too.  I actually wondered why some
referred to their chips as "C" and others were "B", I wondered if
I might have come up short with my chip, but I would suppose not.

I'm not trying to run an ad or anything, but I'd strongly recommend
"infoxpress" for your messages and mail.. It is really fantastic.  You
just log on and "leave the driving to us".  It will even automatically
download files you receive in mail (if you specify a protocol).  Really
neat.  I have it for the CoCo (well, you can tell that by my tagline :-)

I've also got an order in for the OSK version..  It really saves lots
of time..

If it's Hayes compatible, you might issue the command "AT&Q5".. If you
don't get ERROR back, It would probably be error-correcting, as this is
one of the commands related to the error-correcting modems.  But if line
noise is causing garbage, I'd say it isn't.

Thanks for the info, James.  I'd read all the replies to the original
post.. Really makes you proud to be part of a group that can respond
so well to a question.

If I had ever heard about the difference between the designations, it
had passed on to /nil.  It's good to know.. as I'd said to 01Gen, I'd
wondered if my chip was less than the "C"s.  Maybe so, but I suppose
that for the application, it would be of no concern, since my computer was
not stepped up in clock rate or anything.

David,
Regarding the "B", "C" in the various '09 cpu's,  I recall that
Motorola used something like this:

68A09 was 1.0 Mhz.
68B09 was 2.0 Mhz.

If Hatachi followed the same numbering system their chips would
be as follows:

63A09 = 1.0 Mhz
63B09 = 2.0 Mhz
63C09 = 3.0 Mhz

I guess I can't prove any of this since I have long
since disposed of all of my 8-bit Motorola books.

     _gs_rdy() Question
     From: DBREEDING    To: ALL

Hey, Gang,  I have a question.  Why doesn't the following work?

I have tried this both on my OSK and CoCo, and get similar results.
The program as written will continue to loop, keeping getting the "AT"
and "OK", with some other gibberish.  It seems to keep writing and reading
the modem.

If the while{} statement is not used, and The Alternate Method, commented
out, here, is used, if you write something to the modem, then you keep
getting a positive value returned from _gs_rdy().  If you do the for loop
without writing to the modem, you keep getting a -1 returned, which is
correct.  But if something has been written, it looks like the pointer
is not getting updated, and, in fact, it seems that it keeps getting rewritten
to the serial port.. strange.. or am I overlooking something?

Note: this is the coco version, but, as I said, OSK seems to act the same
way.  This here is just a test program.. but it still looks like it SHOULD
work.  I've also tried time loop delays between reads, etc, but still
no luck.. I can't see why it keeps sending to the modem..

          #include <stdio.h>
          #include <lowio.h>

          int mdm;
          char buf[30];

 Dave,

 You need to zero out the path options.  Under 3.2 you will use _gs_opt()
 twice (one to change and one to save), zero out everything but the baud
 rate and use _ss_opt to set the new options.  Since switching to UCC for all
 dvelopment most of my old 3.2 code was put onto floppies so I dn't have
 anything I can convenirntly send you.

     New CD-i Stuff
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

Hi all,

I thought I'd let everyone know about my latest CD-i acquisitions :-)

        o Naked Gun 33 1/3 -- The MPEG encoding on this movie is *VERY* good.
          I was very impressed.  Like other movies, this one came on two discs.
          This movie has VIDEO CD across the bottom; I presume that this movie
          would be able to be played in a dedicated Video CD player.  A very
          good job on this one.

        o Sargon Chess -- Very very cool!  I'm not a great chess player, but
          thought this classic program would be cool to have.  It has a very
          nice tutorial on chess playing and strategy for beginners.  There
          are three modes: Novice, Beginner and Expert.  You can play against
          "Sargon" as white or black, or let Sargon play against himself.  You
          can also edit the board with pieces and locations you want.  This
          feature is great to examine strategy.  Again, Sargon can play against
          himself even in this mode.

          You can select either a 2D or 3D chess perspective.  3D has several
          chess sets (marble, wood, etc.)  There's nice music or comment by
          Sargon when making a move, or you can opt for silence.  You also have
          the option of timing moves and viewing elapsed or cumulative time, or
          no time at all.

I ordered Clue (based on the Parker Brothers board game) but haven't gotten
it yet.  As soon as I do I'll post my observations.

Today I saw Burn:Cycle at the local Sears.  They had it running on the
demo machine.  It was the first time I've ever seen crowds of kids
trying to get at the CD-I display.  From the opening credits, it looks
like a great game.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any in stock.

I was definitely feeling that deep down I want-I want feeling.

Cool!  I hope that *Burn:Cycle* gets featured heavily in ads.

 > From the opening credits, it looks like a great game.

It's an amazing game.  I personally don't go in much for games, but
this one is a *must*.  (Now, if I can just get past that "Step aside,
*LOSER*! <hysterical laugh>" at Psychic Roulette...)

I liked Burn:Cycle too... itis visually spetacualar, and quite entertaining,
BUT itwas not nearly dificult enough. I completed it in less then two evenings
of playing... I think it could have used more action shootouts, and more
puzzles init, with "wrong" turns that could lead you down the wrong
path for a while.

        I might not be there myself, but I'll try to show. Since I have

OS-9000, will run on 80386 and up systems, and also, there is now a version
for the PowerPC. OS-9000 is Microware's "portable" version of OS-9, being
that is is written primarily (entirely?) in C. It hassome differences then
"normal" OS-9, but in general, it acts and feels like OS-9...

OS-9000, which is a lot like OS-9 but instead of being written in assembly
language is written mostly in C, has been ported to 68xxx and 80x86, for
x >= 3.  Microware has committed to doing a version for the PowerPC.

Mac,

I think that would be called OS-9000.  Very expensive from Microware Corp. as
I understand. I don't know of any word on the Power PC.

Hi All!

  Just a quick note. My new utility for reading directories and copying files
from BOTH CDRom and CD-i discs (one utility) has been uploaded to delphi
and should be available soon. Requires a CDRom reader, driver, and decriptor
(anyone's should work, mine included).

  BUT my CDRom File Manager (CDF) will make it obsolete very soon!!!!

Good grief! I've no idea how this msg sat from the 12th till the 21st
without getting my attention. Please accept my apologies. I have been online
many times in that time frame, but with the coco, not the amiga that captures
this stuff via a script. Its late tonite, but look in your mailbox late tomm.
nite for some helping hand. One thing bothers me tho, all the "boot" modules
I've played with have all been the same length, $12A bytes. I think that may
even be carved in fairly hard marble, alltho I can't think of a good reason
for it to be so. As far as putting track 34 back goes, the instructs in my
earlier upload called "krnlutils" should make that pretty easy. That upload
has several items thaT make moving kernals a piece of cake. That set of
utils, and my vfy14.lzh + vfy12.lzh give you enough tools to handle that.
And theres a set of instructs with each. I hope this helps, thats the
help in a nutshell.
Again, sorry I missed it, Cheers, Gene Heskett
