<H1>BBS Messages: The Alan Weston Collection: 1994</H1>
<P>
In 2005, Alan Weston began selling copies of his collection of BBS textfiles on
the Ebay auction site, offering 20 megabytes (uncompressed) of textfiles for $5 plus
shipping. Negotiations for a donation were unsuccessful, so I purchased the CD-ROM
for a total of $9.50; now you get it for free. Much thanks to Alan for offering this
collection to the world, even if there was a toll involved.
