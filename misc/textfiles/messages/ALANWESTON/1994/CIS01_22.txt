The following are some excerpts from the 1/18/94 article in The
Wall Street Journal by Staff Reporter John J. Keller. Page B1.

"Little Microware Aims to Be a Multimedia Giant"

First it gives some background and then...

"Little-known Microware has just landed a coveted piece of
business. BELL ATLANTIC Corp., the regional Bell company, expects
to distribute an interactive service to 10 million households by
the turn of the century. It has placed orders for set-top boxes
from three suppliers. All the boxes, in turn, rely on Microwares
OS/9 software."

More background about what and who Microware is and then later in
the article...

"Microware's OS/9 went head-to-head with a prototype from
Microsoft called Modular Windows in a test by Bell Atlantic, says
Arthur Orduna, a Microware marketing manager. he brags that OS/9
beat its rival. A Microsoft spokeswoman doesn't dispute this
account."

There is more to the article that I quoted here but it is
important that Microware landed this contract for many reasons.
It assures Microwares place in the future and thru them ours. By
making OS/9 so visible it will make it easier for all of us to
justify OS/9 to new users. The influx of money into Microware
from this deal will likely help Microware provide new and
important software in the future for all of us. It will also
quiet those nay sayers who proclaim the demise of OS/9.

Whether it will directly help those of us in the market now is yet
to be seen. However in my mind this deal can only help to expand
the market for OS/9 and therefore the slice of the pie that each
vendor has can only increase.

All in all this is a milestone for Microware and I congratulate
all of those who worked long and hard to put this deal together.

A hearty WELL DONE!

Fm: Ian Hodgson 72177,1762
To: All

Hey, to anyone else out there who is using Data Master on the CoCo. Have any of
you run into the same problem as I have, and perhaps found a solution?

The problem is that when my file exceeds about 950 records, DM has problems
with sorting. The sort seems to progress through its three phases (reading the
key fields, sorting them, and writing the key file) but goes off into outer
space when trying to return to the main program. My guess is that the key
fields (or some memory used during sorting) is overwriting some essential stuff
when it exceeds a certain size. The CoCo doesn't crash, but even the module
header appears to get scribbled, since a PROCS no longer shows the module name
or even the ID sometimes.

Fortunately, the key file SEEMS to be written correctly, but recovery sometimes
requires rebooting; a completely unacceptable bug. Any suggestions would be
appreciated. I would happily change to something other than DM, but have found
nothing else that will do the job (which requires, among other things,
three-level sorts).

Bob,

    Some good looking suggestions there. I'll give them a try. However, as I'm
starting to get a little anxious about the ability to pull out some faster
performance, how about this...

    I see that memcpy () is quite a bit more efficient than I thought. However,
it has to be written to check and deal with a number of situations, possibly
some error checking, definitely a check of the length of the data to be moved
so that it knows whether there will be a remainder if longword moves are
performed that would require a final move.b and/or move.w. Since I know exactly
what the size of each move will always be, and since I know it is divisible by
4, wouldn't I save some time in having a shortened, specialized version of
memcpy() designed specifically for this task? And yes, I would definitely be
interested in the disassembly of memcpy() if you can find it.

    Actually, its my understanding that he does use the PIXAC for the mouse
pointer. I think it was Kevin himself who told me that. I have tried to get
info on using the PIXAC from 'C'. Only one person had even played with it, and
he'd done it in assembly, which I'm trying to avoid dealing with if at all
possible.

..Thanks...

The OS-9 TOP-package contains a UUCP and mail-reader(OXM) that works nice. I

Does anyone here use this program? If so, does it work, cause any problems,

I too have seen this product advertised but quite frankly the price, at $295 is
quite steep for something I have never heard anything about.

I notice also that Mark Griffith at DCCS has put SpeedDisk on the market. It is
probably just as functional and is 1/3 the price.

The Epson printer drivers in the latest Ghostscript version are not right.  It
would appear that I made a small blunder in assuming that they were the same as
prev versions.

The DeskJet driver and the new KWindows color display in the "gs2" upload are
OK.  I'll fix the epson stuff and re-upload as soon as I can, meanwhile, Epson
owners beware.
