
There have been various ports of UUCP-like programs to OS-9/6809 and to
OS-9/68000.  Boisy Pitre, I think, is going to release one shortly that from

WH> What is the Internet policy on commercial sales

I think it is similar to Fido, but I really haven't seen anything in
writing.

I have seen a couple of vendors, myself included, post messages with
prices. It doesn't happen very often though. To the best of my knowledge,
there have been no complaints/flack as a result of this.
