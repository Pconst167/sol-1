Frank,

Well, surely neither one of is innocent when it comes to "hype"! <grin>

I suppose whether or not IMS loses sales remains to be seen -- when the hype is
supported by performance, a customer will buy.

I generally feel reluctant to get into discussions of commercial products in
the forum, particularly if I'm associated with one. I'll be glad to post
something like "Hey, y'all! Check out our new upload in DL15!" but to go ahead
and be Drew Kaplan on the OS9 Forum is not my style.

I don't think being "open" will lose you any sales and put you in a
non-competitive position, btw. I think customers like being told what's up. So
keep at it, Frank!

If you end up saying things that are technically problematic, though, I'll have
to leave the OS9 Forumites the job of correction.

I will say one thing, however, and that is that a 32 bit bus, like a 16 bit
bus, is a valid design CHOICE. There are arguments both ways, and both ways
have merit. Certainly cost and performance are factors, but until you know the
COST of the bus and the details about present and future PERFORMANCE, let's let
the issue lie. We're both dealing in ignorance. And I certainly, in ANY case,
cannot comment on the TC9 and TC70 because designs are not finalized.

You're doing a great job, Frank, and as one marketeer to another, hats off for
your efforts.

Best wishes,

Paul

Kevin;

  Help!  I'm not understanding what's happening here!

I've started running MemberDir after capturing the latest messages, and for
some reason, it won't pick up Syscall.  I've got copies of gfx2, Inkey, and
Syscall with all 3 merged into each, bul not RunB.  How come the system won't
pick up Syscall from a packed procedure?  Everything is fine if I pre-load the
3 modules.

  Now for the _really_ strange part... after running MemberDir, and with the 3
modules still in memory, if I try to reply to a message using View, it bombs
out when trying to save the reply with an error 201 - illegal path #. Do you
have any ideas why this is happening??  All the other file I/O functions in
View work O.K. except for the reply path... and this works O.K. if I don't
preload the gfx2, etc. modules.  ??? %-<

Jim - wow. I haven't run either one.. perhaps someone can try that out.

The first dealie I might have an idea on. In the merged set in CMDS that you
called "syscall", is syscall the first module? If not, it won't find it right
off, I think.

Got no idea on the View path problem. Does that program ask for another file
name, or use the same file?  The paths command might show something if things
are around long enuf. Luck!

Kev;

  You were right on about the gfx2/syscall/inkey thing... I remerged them so
that the first module is the same as the name, and things are working fine now.
On reflection, it makes sense that if a Basic09 program makes a call to say,
SysCall, finds a merged set of modules named syscall in CMDS, and upon loading
it, finds that the first pgm. i.d. is something other than what it's looking
for, an error 43 would be generated.  Simple with hindsight. :-)

  As far as the apparent problem with View goes,nthe only thing that had
changed was the pre-loading of the above 3 modules, and I just don't see how
that would affect paths.  ???   Hafta do some more detective work.

(2 days later) Both View and MemberDir woHk fine now... no more flakiness.
Original question still remains - why would pre-loading gfx2/inkey/syscall
cause a paths error?  I don't see any relationship here.    Anybody??

I guess I forgot to do a page for defdrive().  Here's your chance!

MROFF does do line wraps, but I turned it off for the name and synopsis
sections of the manual pages cause I didn't want it to wrap.  I know a couple
of the lines are longer than the width of the rest of the text.  I printed
everything out here before I uploaded it (that's how I found out the page
numbers for the index), so it should have printed fine for you too.

The numbers at the top of the page are like JJ said, an attempt to made things

~ Yes finally figured out inkey on Basic09/68000 it is NOT like the basic09's
inkey on the CoCo. what inkey does on the 68000 is to tell you how many keys
are pending (how many characters in the buffer) so if you wanted to simulate
the inkey function do this:

Procedure GetKey

PARAM path:BYTE PARAM char:string[1]

dim i:integer

i:=sNKEY(#path)

if i>0 then get #path,C endif

end

all this does is if there is any characters pending it will grab one. if nomne
are present the read call (get command) is ignored.

Hope this helps!

A real question is how much POKEing a Basic program (including
Microware/Basic09) uses.  A POKE is just as good as a C pointer for blowing up
houses, hotels, whatever, if its address argument hasn't been set right.  Just
like a pointer.

"Serious" Basic programs are throwing PEEKs, POKEs, and VARPTRs all over the
place.  C just provides a more shorthand notation for these operations, grin.

You mean that OSK Basic uses 64-bit floaters? That means floating-point
algorithms will run just as slow in Basic as in C under OSK.  One advantage of
Basic09 on the 6809 is that its single-precision (32 bits, and to heck with the
IEEE) floating math was MUCH FASTER than C, which insists on the cumbersome
double precision, whether you want it or not.

That's right -- on a Coco, a floating-point program in Basic09 will outrun the
same code in C.  I was amaxzed to discover that.  --mike k

You are dead right about wild C pointers, and how amazingly you can get away
for years and never know you've got a funny pointer, because there just happens
to be nobody else using the few bytes of memory that it stores a line of
keyboard input into, or whatever.

However, Basic09 and Basic can blow up any system too, using POKE with an
argument that didn't get initialized right.  I've written RSBASIC programs that
built up binary-byte arrays, requiring POKE, and I could have blown that too.

Yes, memory protection hardware is great for catching wild stuff. But it also
may keep you from reading system variables, writing directly to I/O devices,
and other things that we "shouldn't" be doing, but sometimes you have to for
speed.  I hope we don't have to on the MM/1.  --mike k.

I hope that you will become an advocate for "doing things right" on the MM/1
and not resorting to or telling others that you must use "bad ways" to get your
programs to work at the speed you think necessary when you port them.  I know
we've talked out this before on the CoCo but I feel it will become even more
important with the MM/1 since it is a Level I machine, and because the user
(and programmer) base is potentially much larger.

This will become critical when network software is developed and the remote
graphic terminal ideas we discussed on LISTSERV are available.  Your position
as a well known programmer will serve to show others that these sort of tactics
are "bad, bad" (in my best G. Bush voice) and not encourage others to try it. 
We all want to see well behaved software that is portable and easily
upgradeable.  Cheating in the real human world always gets its just rewards
sometime and I don't see any difference in the programming world.

I am personally counting on your support in this area.

Mark, 
 
I downloaded the Kreider library docs.  I appreciate your putting them  
together - it must have been quite an effort! 
 
I finally got mroff compiled, and am well on my way toward getting the docs  
printed.  But I could not get 'make' to work (never used it before).   
Here's my slightly edited version of your makefile: 
 
* Makefile to compile MROFF 
 
ODIR = /dd/lang/c/cmds 
RDIR = /dd/lang/rels 
RFILES = nromain.r nrotxt.r nromac.r nroio.r 
* CFLAGS = -s 
 
mroff: $(RFILES) 
 chd /dd/lang/rels; cc $(RFILES) -f=$(ODIR)/Mroff -m=4k -e=11 
 
nroio.r: nro.h nroio.c 
nromac.r: nro.h nromac.c 
nrotxt.r: nro.h nrotxt.c 
nromain.r: nro.h nromain.c 
 
* END 
 
And here is the output it produces: 
 
cc  -r=/dd/lang/rels nromain.c 
cc  -r=/dd/lang/rels nrotxt.c 
cc  -r=/dd/lang/rels nromac.c 
cc  -r=/dd/lang/rels nroio.c 
chd /dd/lang/rels; cc nromain.r nrotxt.r nromac.r nroio.r - 
f=/dd/lang/c/cmds/Mroff -m=4k -e=11 
 
Now my compiler (the plain vanilla cc1 level I Microware version sold by  
Tandy) chokes on the -r=stuff.  Of course I had to rename the file 'cc' for  
the sake of make.  -r all by itself is an OK option.  Why does make'  
produce this non-legal output?  Or am I missing something here? 
 
  make - edition $12, CRC = $41F1F2 
  cc1  - edition   4, CRC = $63CE5F

The utility that I plan to write will be a 'desc.bbs' file editor for RiBBS

to create the file but I want a program dedicated to that file. It can be a
pain to add, delete, purge etc... filenames from it by going thru it one
filename at a time. The utility will be able to allow the sysop to make a list
of filenames to purge and then delete then instantiously. My idea is sort of a
screen editor type program. The only problem I was having was the reading the

Hi Jim!

Sure took a long time to get there.

Re MIZAR vs Standard OS9 formats.  Standard OS-9 format uses 10 sectors on
track 0 and 16 sectors for the rest.  MIZAR format uses 16 sectors per track
across the board.  If you look in your ..../BOOTOBJS directory, you should find
a file 'x0' - that's set for MIZAR format. Just load and use it. Or, you can
use 'moded' or 'dmode' to modify your existing d(x) descriptor.

Kevin,
  The new gfx2 module is a major help in writing Multi-Vue or mouse operated
programs.  However, I was wondering if there is anyway to change the enable/
disable of a menu/item without having to send the entire data packet to gfx2
every time?

Floyd, should be able to. For example, if you had set up a menu item as:

 RUN gfx2("Item",menudesc,1,"Files",Enable)

then you should be able to just run that statement again with Disable instead
(a zero).

You can within reason, change anything on the fly, including attaching new
pulldown menus entirely if you wished to.

Oh. I see. You wanted to change it without going thru gfx2? Yes, it could be
done, but it'd be a mess figuring out how. And you'd have to use either byte
arrays or do peeks/pokes.  Howcum you want to bypass gfx2 for this, btw?
 thx - kev

No, no, no. You miss understand.  I still want to use gfx2.  I'll give you an
example of what I mean.  I'm writing a program where I change menus and items
from enable to disable and back again several times.  For items it's no big
deal because there isn't that much info to send.  However, for menus there is
alot of info to send.  I was thinking something like this would be nice:

 RUN gfx2("MNDisable",wd,1)

 Which is a lot better than:
 run gfx2("Menu",wd,1,"Disk",MId_Disk,8,4,m1,Enable)
 each time I wish to change the enable/disable.

 Do you think my suggestion would be possible?

Hi Kev--Thanks for the new GFX2. I am using it now and I need a little help. I
have duplicated the code in July 1990 Rainbow starting at line 7000 for use in
another program. In the new program it wont go back to the calling window but
rather it goes to the main Multiview window and I have to use the clear key to
get back. Any ideas??

Phil - I don't have that Rainbow, but is that where it close out the extra
window and tries to come back with a Select?

Maybe this will help: place a Select path#0 gfx2 call at the beginning of your
program. That may help os9 figure out who to come back to. This was originally
impossible in the stock gfx2, as it failed on some path numbers. Hmm. You might
be able to leave out the path0 specification. Dunno. Try a coupla variations.

I've used run gfx2(1,"select") when returning from other windows that were
killed off and it works fine. I used it in my MultiEdit program when some of
the Tandy menu options required their own windows.

Good question. .EXE files are NOT runnable (currently) on the MM/1. DOS

Nam,

A variety of SCSI based tape backups are available, especially in 5.25" format.
Check in the Shopper. PRices start at $325 or so. On the CoCo 3 you'll need to
find a SCSI interface and maybe hack it up a little to hang the baby on the
bus. I think OwlWare and KenTOn have SCSI stuff.

Kevin Darling probably has the number for KenTon. Kevin?

Oh yes, I knew all those numbers.  No sense having more than 1 millisec
resolution.  But the more resolution available on recording, the easier it is
for algorithms that try to figure out what rhythm the player intended.  If
quantized down to 1/60th or so, good guessing may become harder.  Anyway, for
playing 1/100th is plenty fine for me.

Pete, and Lester -- one more thing to throw into the discussion -some synths
are a lot slower than others to respond to MIDI messages and get their stinkin'
notes turned on.  Roland MT32 is noticeably slow at times, even to my classical
ears (my worst critic was an acid "house music" fan).  And Keyboard Mag current
issue really badmouthed some new synth in a review for being too slow.

I bet Lester's friends who can tell 96 from 192 ticks/beat are listening to
drum machines, which I hope are built to more exacting standards than some of
the newer synths.  --mike k

Well, a loaner would be a lot of hassle for you.  I think we'll just wait till
our development machine shows up and use that. Next meeting is 2nd Thursday in
August, and the OS9 Club meets on 4th THursdays, so any time 2nd City gets a
machine there will be a meeting within 2 weeks anyway.  Plus we'd need time to
learn enuf to demo the beast properly.  Sooo...just let me know approximately
when 2nd City will get theirs.  Tanks, mike k

Hi CHes!  The only difference between Levels 5 and 6 scores is the "MIDI
Channel Hop", whereby any part can change its channel assignmnet on the fly,
just like an instrument.  THis lets one part play the sax on the Yamaha and
later the flute on the Casio, etc.

I doubt either of those scores actually used the feature, but they might. It
also lets you "borrow" percussion voices for "real music" and vice versa even
if you have only one synth.

However, version 4.6.0 and 4.6.1 do have a great poiont-n-shoot file loading
system, and...OOPS, I think 4.5.x does NOT have Percussion Staves, is that
right?  I HOPE uploads are using those, so yes, you should call Ed at 2nd City
and ask for 4.6.1 or 4.6.2 maybe.  He isn't sending them out exc ept to those
who ask.

I hope to be in Atlanta -- Ed certainly will be, and if I can't make it he will
demo the daylights out of Umuse3 (he has done some SERIOIUS mousing lately and
plays two sytns at once).

I have 4.7.0 with Articulations (staccato, marcato, etc) but it isn't
"released" yet, tho I think it's ready to roll.  --mike k.
