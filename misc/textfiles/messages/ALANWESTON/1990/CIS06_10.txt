Mike - the flickerFixer for the Amiga (about $500?) contains a lot of RAM. What
it does is to combine the two interlaced fields, and then squirt them out at
multisync monitor speed (double normal horizontal scan rate).

The A3000 has such a gizmo built in, and word is that CBM plans one for their
other machines now. So the fF people had a good time for quite a while, but
looks like CBM wants the dough now. Can't blame them.

Obviously the same method could be rigged up on the VSC output, if someone
wants to do so.

Kevin,

Thanks for the note.

My computer, however, is NOT a Coco 3.

It's a Creative Micro System Level Two (version 1.2) box with 192K ram, two
RS232 ports, Wyse 50 terminal, an 80 track floppy and 10 meg hard drive. It
reads and writes standard OS9 disks with single density track 0. Coco disks
(and the Virtual Terminal program disk from SE Media) make it choke.

As you suggested, I looked at the first sector of the disk with a disk editor
and it looks Ok - however, the TKS and SPT settings are both $0A; the FMT is
$00; the TOT is only $015E; and the DAT ($49,$20,$40,$00,$03) doesn't make any
sense at all unless you're Rod Serling :-).  I've tried changing the TKS and
SPT (using Dmode at startup) from $10 to $0A and the FMT from $07 to $00. But,
no go. I even tried setting up an identical Ram disk to backup from drive d1 to
r0. It worked until track $0A. Then error 247.

(Sectors 1 to 9 look Ok.)

Does the $0A value for the TKS and SPT sound reasonable? Could sector 0 be
corrupted?

On standard OS9 diskettes, t0s (track 0's sector count) always = 10 ($0a), and
they are single density. Most of the other tracks are double density, and will
have 16 sectors per track (sct = $10).

If the disk is single density, then the other tracks will likely also be 10
sectors long (sct = $0a), like track 0.

Pete,

I've been playing with the D1 descriptor all day. And no matter what values I
give it, I can't read past sector 9. I even changed the bootfile D1 descriptor
to expect single density throughout the disk. And just about every other
combination. I still can't read past sector 9. I'm beginning to think this disk
has taken a hit.

Is there any other reason why I can't read it?

Either that, or your disk drivers are 'hardwired', as your terminal drivers

~ Wendell,
  Since both T0S and TKS are $0A, it probably means a single density disk
throughout.  Try setting your T0S to $0A, and if that doesn't work then try
setting DNS (density) to $00.  Just a shot in the dark, but any drivers I've
written depend on having the number of sectors on track 0 and the basic disk
type ($00 for standard vs. $20 for CoCo) correct.  They can figure out the rest
of the disk from there if the LSN0 info is good.  Oh, if you're trying to read
the disk in a 96 tpi drive, you might have to set the DNS to $02, which should
tell the driver that the drive is 96 tpi and then it'll be able to figure out
whether or not double stepping is required for a 48 tpi disk (maybe!  <grin>).
  Bruce

PS:  Since I saw some more message traffic between yourself & Pete Lyall after
composing this reply I think it sounds more like the tpi might be the problem.

  Your help with my problem and your clarification of the PMap utility has made

and then attempted to pre-load them.  Well, the system gave me a module not

seperately?

I have a couple of questions for you. Now under OS-9 C is C right? If this is
so, would you be kind enough to look at some source code that I typed out of
The Rainbow. When I try to compile it, there are three errors that come up, and
I can't see why. True I don't know all that much about C, but have went over
the listings in the mag several times and can't seehwhere there are any
mistakes.

Also what is the difference between Ipatch and Modpatch? I know they are quite
different, but what is the difference? The reason I ask is I downloaded an
aicapak patch from a BBS, (it was Wayne Days) and it had versions for both
Ipatch and Modpatch in there. Is there an advantage to using one over the
other?

There is a C Compiler for OS9, though. Upload your source, or mail it to me,
and we'll se what can be found. In the meantime, if you want to buff up your C
a bit, the C Primer Plus by the Waite Group is an excellent book.

Re: modpatch and Ipatch -

modpatch (supplied with OS9/LII) will patch a module in memory. This is only
good for overlaying existing bytes.

Ipatch/mkpatch is a pair of tools written by Bob Santy that take two different
versions of a binary file, and generate a patch 'differences' file. Then, you
can use Ipatch to apply this patch to other binaries. This is especially useful
when distributing things like OS9 driver patches, as we can't pass out the
source code, and the resultant driver might not be the same size anyway.

  Yep, thats just about exactly what I had in mind for the quoting feature.
Now, can you make it smart enough to put the quote source's initials in the
quote indicator?  <grin>  Just kidding!
  On the other hand, some BBSes I've seen have editors that automatically look
up the quote source's name (from the "FROM: " line?) and extract initials. I'm
not sure how that works in the case of a name that has more or less than two
parts, maybe it just grabs the first character then after that each character
following a space until the end of the name line?  That might not work too well
here because the PIN is always appended after the name.  I'll let you decide
whether or not you want to worry about it!  <grin>
  When do we get to see the new View?  I'll be waiting for your upload
announcement!

gfx2 is a procedure, not part of BASIC09 as such.  I'd be heavily surprised if
