Zack, Could you check that modpatch script again.  When I used it the third
line:

c 02c3 0c 0d

gave a "byte does not match" message.

I tried to run phantomgraph anyway, but it locked up when I tried to print.

Sb: GFX Speed Comparison
Fm: Kevin Darling (UG Pres) 76703,4227
To: all

Just for fun, I've run a speed comparison test... what I did was to GET an
80x40 block of gfx, and then PUT it across the screen in a matrix (the actual
count of PUTs is close to 1400). All programs were in Basic.

The results were:

 15Mhz 68070 (MM/1)  at 640x208x16-color -   6 seconds (prelim ver)
  2Mhz  6809 (Coco3) at 640x192x 4-color - 490 seconds (old grfdrv)
  2Mhz  6809 (Coco3) at 640x192x 4-color -  34 seconds (fast grfdrv)
  2Mhz  6809 (Coco3) at 640x192x 4-color -  55 seconds (RSDOS Basic)

Previous tests drawing lines and circles had also shown the same ratio between
the 68K and L-II fast grfdrv... about 5:1.

Now note that the MM/1 was moving twice as much data, because it was in
16-color mode vs 4-color on the CoCo. So I reran the fast grfdrv L-II test
using 16-color mode (same number of PUTs) to be more fair...

  2Mhz  6809 (Coco3) at 320x192x16-color -  54 seconds (fast grfdrv)

Now the 68070 shows up as almost 10 times as fast. Starting both tests at the
same time really shows this speed diff up... the MM/1 goes splat! splat! splat!
onto the screen and finishes, while the coco continues for what seems like an
eternity. And I had been so proud of my fast grfdrv Puts <wry grin>.

Right - the FD sector has all the info ABOUT the file (owner, size, dates,
attributes).

Best approach has been found to open two paths. One to the directory you're
reading, and one to the whole RAW disk (i.e. /DD@). This way, when you read the
LSN # from the directory, you can seek to the LSN * 256 on the RAW disk path
and get right to the file's info. This is much faster than opening each file
and doing an SS.FD getstat on it.

Hi Mike!

Read your comments on Basic on the MM/1.  Did not seem to jive with my
experiences so I duplicated your tests.  My CoCo is model 3 with 512k memory -
basically a 'vanilla' machine.  For the 68k tests, I have a PT68 model K4 which
uses a 68000 chip, has 4 megs of memory and runs at 16 MHz.  OS is version 2.3,
Basic is version 2.1.

I also had the tests run two 'VME' machines.  One machine was a 68010 running
at 12 MHZ.  The operating system for this machine is Version 2.2 and the
version of basic is 1.2.  No other tasks were running.

The second machine was a 68030 running at 25 MHz.  The operating system for
this machine is Version 2.3 and the version of basic is 2.3.  This machine has
a math coprocessor and an indeterminate number of other tasks were active.

             These are the results (in seconds)
    (I included your results on the MM/1 for comparison purposes.)

CoCo  MM/1   PT68K4   68010      68030      Conditions
  4     3       1        3          1       As written (k=1000)
 40            12       26          8       k=10000
 78    59      23       52         14       k=20000
 10    13       8        8          2       k=1000 (Changed integers to real)

Note that in all cases the PT68 was faster than the CoCo.  Marginally when
using real numbers and substantially when using integers.

(continued from preceeding message)

I have no explanation for the poor performance of the 68010 machine except that
the version of basic09 was an old one.  Have no idea as to its relative
performace.  But, it is interesting that it handled the case of real numbers as
well as the PT68.

The CoCo had no background tasks running.  The PT68 had a 'cron-like' program
running as a background task.  I don't think this process influenced the tests
significantly.  And, I think the 1 MHz difference in clock speeds between the
MM/1 and PT68 is insignificant when compared to the overall results.

To be sure we're running the same tests, I used the basic09 'benchmark' program
on page 196 of 'The Complete Rainbow Guide to OS-9'.  On the 680x0 machines the
line 'SHELL "date,t"' was changed to 'SHELL "date"'.

It would be interesting to see a similar test run on Frank Hogg's machines;
i.e., the 'tomcat', 'tc70', 'QT', etc.

I curious as to the speed differences.  I had 'heard' the 68070 is not as fast
as the 68000 because of internal architectural differences. Do you know if this
is true?  Or, is the speed difference due to the version of OSK and Basic used?

It might be interesting to continue this testing; i.e., running ML programs on
the MM/1 and PT68K.  If you'd like to devise some tests and send them to me,
I'd be happy to run them.  And, if you're nearby (I'm in Delaware) and would
like to come by, I'd be happy to let you run any programs and tests you'd like
(maybe bring your machine down and run side-by-side tests).

 Ed The version of Basic that Mike is using is pretty old. Also the MM/1 will
have the same speed as the TC70 in the MM/1 minimum configuration. The memory
on the minimum MM/1 is shared with the video display and is much slower than if
it were private. The memory is accesed every 533 ns instead of being accesed
every 266 ns if there were no wait states. When the MM/1 is upgraded with the
I/O board the speeds will improve significantly. I ran the drystone benchmark
on my old PT68k and got around 950 drystones /second with a 12.5 MHz clock. The
MM/1 with fast memory on the I/O board gets around 950 drystones -

The MM/1 like make has will get around 600 drystones/second. The 68070
processor is definitly slower then the 68000. A 68070 at 15 MHz is the same
general speed as a 68000 at 12.5 MHz. The TC70 should show verry close to the
same speed. although I don't know much about memory speed on that board.

I added a test on a 3-meg MM/1 (2-megs fast RAM for program, 1-meg shared RAM
for video) and got these times in seconds (slowest to fastest):

              1000 10000 20000  1000
 CPU          ints  ints  ints  real   Computer     Basic

  2Mhz  6809 -   4    40    78    10   CoCo
 15Mhz 68070 -   3    30    59    19   MM/1 (1meg)    2.1
 12Mhz 68010 -   3    26    52     8   VMEbus ?       1.2
 15Mhz 68070 -   2    20    39    13   MM/1 (3meg)    2.1
 16Mhz 68000 -   1    12    23     8   PT68K          2.1
 25Mhz 68030 -   1     8    14     2   VMEbus ?       2.3

This shows the speed increase when not running out of video RAM on the MM/1.

It also seems to show up an anomaly. Why did the 68010 do so well using REAL
variables?  Does the earlier Basic version use smaller data or is just a
mistake in your chart? - kev

Hi Kevin!

We don't know the reason for the 68010 being so slow.  The tests were run
several times and we got the same results each time.  We *suspect* the problem
has to do with the version of basic used.  We intend to retry with a later
version of basic.

Ed - it wasn't that it was slow.... it was that the 68010 was so FAST on the
REALs test.  That is, not in line with its other results.

As to why it was slow overall otherwise, I'd suspect slow memory?

least one bug.  i.e. The first bugfree program has yet to be written.

    You've heard the old saw: Every program has at least one bug, and every
program can be shortened by one line.  Therefore by regression every program
can be reduced to one line of code.....that doesn't work.

routines, datin, I think, is used by the editor to input each line. Apparently,
that routine don't like commas, cuz when I enter a message line which contains

re: $79 keyboard/trackball

  Forget it!  It's chintzy... too light, didn't like the keyboard layout/feel,
and the trackball is too close to the keypad and edge of the board.  No room
for ham-hands like mine.

  I did play with one trackball for a while tho, and I really liked it.  It was
a 3 button that had buttons #1 and #2 wrapping around the ball dlmost the full
length of the pad, and button #3, the drag-lock centered at the top.
  Very easy to use and well designed ergonomically.  Good control too, using
variable cpi.  It looked as though the faster yousmoved the ball, the more cpi
that is fed to the driver - coarse control; and the slower you moved it, the
less cpi.  If I remember, it was something like 50-360 cpi.

Phil, I just had a look at the source for "words" and it looked fine. So I
tried the program, and I too got a 216. What happened is that the compiled
program in the archive (as well as the one on my hard drive) is an earlier
version of words. All you need to do is either recompile the program, or use
the version you have but do a "chd /dd/sys/spell" first. The version you have
is looking for the file "dictionary", not "/dd/sys/spell/dictionary".

BTW, I will be uploading a new version of "spell" later this week (as soon as
my 2400 baud modem arrives). It is twice as fast again as the one you now have.

Mark, There really are some too-long lines in the docs. I'm using an 80 column
printer in pica. If you are too then something is really strange.

Regarding the numbers at the top of the pages, I should have figured out the
Unix connection myself. After all (I'm learning bit by bit) if there is
something cryptic relating to OS9 then is usually a Unix influence. Just what
was the mother-tongue of the folks who created Unix anyway??? <grin>

Oh, and thanks for the reminder about the index--I guess I can just print out
the man.hlp file and stick it in the back of my new manual. Should work fine.

I'll leave defdrive() for now--I'm not sure why anyone would ever use that
command anyway? Guess it is a hold-over from before /dd conventions?

Oh, I just noticed that the description for RAND() is still wrong. Unless I am
missing something in the way the function works it does not use a scale factor.
It would be nice if it did! Could this be a difference between clib.l and
clibt.l?

Sorry, it happened again.  I uploaded readmac.pak into lib 10 and forgot to say
that it requires KD's enhanced GFX2.  Could you *Please?* include it in my
description?  Thank you very much . . .

I've been working on my utility and got it to read the directory and print the
filenames and the LSN numbers. I set it up to read the directory using TYPE.
Here is how I did it. 'TYPE direntry=name:STRING[29]; lsn0,lsn1,lsn2:BYTE' When
I tell it to print each filename, after resetting the last character of the
filename, and print the LSN's 0-2, this is what it looks like. e.g. FILENAME
LSN0=0 LSN1=119 LSN2=203 Which one of those do I use to 'SEEK' to the filenames
FD sector and get my info? Do I have to multiply the lsn's together to get that
sector number? And if so, what's the formula? (I'm getting closer! This is 
fun!) OS9 has opened all new doors to me...amazing stuff!

George -

Yep - you're on the trail.... here's the scoop:

The LSN is a 3 byte number. Basically, the breakdown is -

                   MSB * 256 * 256
                +  NSB * 256
                +  LSB
                ========================
                  LSN #

In C, there are functions for taking these three bytes and making a LONG
INTEGER out of them (and back). Under B09, you may have to use a type REAL,
since the result is greater than +/- 32767.

~ Well my BBS in Basic09 does need a PEEK for carrier since ACIAPAK has no way
to tell it for me. but its not hard-coded so the user may use a pak thats
addressed differently then the standard pak. Even though this isn't "clean"
code I never have a problem multi-tasking or anything like that. The modem kill
switch (type=20) is ucreliable and is a shock to the system. so i let my BBS
handle it.

~ Well I too take the stand against "bad programs" and my BBS is clean as it
can get with the exception of peeking for carrier.. thats all! I allow users to
imbed the base address in a file so he may use other paks and other ports but I
had no choice but to do it that way. sure if I toyed with it i could do other
features but ii would be nothing less then dirty. Alot of Alpha's BBS owners
complained about it... sure he has some slick features I don't have but the
cost is system ram, crashes, and other erratic operations... which would you
rather have???

Sb: Sound.Master Problems
Fm: JIM MCDOWELL 70721,435
To:  76370,1366

I will need more information to be certain as to the problem you are
experiencing.  Here are some things to check:

- SSC and SSCART should be placed on your boot disk (with Config, Ezgen, etc.)
  To determine if they are working try this:
        iniz ssc
        echo hi >/ssc
  If you get an error these files are not working properly.

- Be sure RunB and GFX2 are in memory.  Preferably merged together.
        merge RunB Gfx2 >RunbX
        attr Runbx e pe
        load Runbx
  You can even Runb GFX2 and Sound.Master together..

- Be sure to load Sound.Master into memory.  It won't always run correctly
  by just typing in its name.
        load Sound.Master
        sound

- Be sure XMODE is in memory, although this shouldn't give an error 43 if
  missing.


From your description it sounds like something is missing in memory that needs
to be there so check that first. The program should draw more than just three
small screens. It begins with 3 in the upper left corner one in the upper right
corner one in the lower left and lower right corner and one in the middle. If
it fails before completing this then perhaps one of the draw files are missing.
 Here is a list of the files included in sound.master:

  128 $22 $AEE898   sound
   53 $22 $7E9959   cursor
   53 $22 $D6120E   menu
  133 $22 $18D62D   filemenu
   53 $22 $6C0FF1   process
   53 $22 $C4A015   switch
   53 $22 $2E6AF4   putregs
   52 $22 $1E94CB   getname
   53 $22 $09D119   getfile
   35 $22 $14B9CE   tone
   29 $22 $F7D2B4   slider
   35 $22 $577141   connect
   35 $22 $94594E   envelope
  132 $22 $7980D7   env1
   35 $22 $6FF97D   noise
  129 $22 $469828   ltrbox
  132 $22 $623956   spkr
   35 $22 $729CE6   menubox
   53 $22 $99B7CD   pointer
   53 $22 $49E1DC   pal
   14 $22 $2E555B   alpha
   53 $22 $9EA968   tables
   19 $22 $E8C3A5   registers

Do an  IDENT sound.master -sv   to double check this.

Its a long reply but I hope it helps.  Please let me know if you still have any
problems.  If you do put together a file with an MDIR and MFREE and IDENTS for
sound progs then mail them to me.  This with a detailed description will make
it easier to pinpoint the A(X.

The fact that all the software is included is really amazing. Makes me wonder

Tsk, tsk, Mike! Yeah, my dogs are well fed. Incidentally, the dogs are also
doing a much better job of making my time worth while! Perhaps not as elegant
as the MM/1 but my AT is supported by a wealth of software. And yes, PC-Lyra
has been out for almost 8 months now. Hope to get some advertising going soon.

How come I don't see anything in the latest Rainbow for Second City Software? A
friend of mine even said that he tried calling them and got a message saying
that the number was disconnected!

Are you going full steam on the MM/1? Sounds like a dream machine. I just wish
that it had been released 5 years ago. Life might be very different now.

No, Mike. The friends who can tell the difference between 96 and 192 ticks per
beat were doing it with stock synths. But I heartily agree with you, that some
synths are very sloppy when it comes to responding quickly to MIDI input.
