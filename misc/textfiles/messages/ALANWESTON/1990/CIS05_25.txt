  Yep, we definitely gots our _faults_ out here!  And the Pacific coastline,
while it's got some incredible scenery, ain't no great shakes for recreation if
it involves getting wet (unless you like wet rubber suits!).

Anywhere north of Virginia is Yankeeland... but especially big cities like New
York.. wherever people rush too much and drive too crazy ;-). As you said, the
NorthEastern states.

Gotta admit that many of them are beautiful country tho, at least outside the
big cities.

Hope you don't mind hot, muggy days... we get a lot here. Nothing like Georgia

To: Kevin Darling (UG Pres) 76703,4227 (X)

Kev I don't have problems starting window from Gshell (MV) except when I want
to kill mv and keep some windows going, I get a msg saying that some procs are
still running. Solution, start some windowsfrom my startup file. I now have 1
80*24, 2 80*12 (one over the other), and 2 40*24 windows come up when I boot
up, in addition to MV. I wanted to get fancy and show off my coco3/os9 by
jumping to each window after it was created and either display a picture or a
have a msg or something else neat being displayed. But I can't get that damn
display 1b21 to work. Keith Alphonso gave me some insight on how to get around
this, but I think I left it at my old residence! Anyway, what does wmode do ?
Do I need it. I seem to be able to create windows with wcreate ok, as well as
some of the utilities that Keith sells. I'm pretty sure I was able to do this
many moons ago when I was only into os9 lII about a year or so (yeah, like I'm
a real veteran now, right !), but it eludes me again. I assume that the 1b20's
accomplish the same thing as wcreate ????

I wish I could use my coco3 at work instead of a PC. Just think, I could have
windows (or a form of them) for about $200, and segment offsets to boot! What a
deal. Can't see how Intel ever swayed the industry with that knind of
architecture.

Tony,

Right, 1b20 xx's do the same thing as wcreate does (altho wcreate also iniz's
the window I think).

Wmode lets you set up all windows to default to 80x24, which is handy if you
like to start applications just by "program <>>>/w&", y'see.

I think with the latest info I gave you, you should be able to do what you
want, more or less. Not everything is possible with any windowing system. The
rules for us with the 1b21 Select code are fairly simple:

* For immediate visible change to take place, you must be running off the
current interactive window. This makes sense, as you wouldn't want any program
in the world to switch windows on you while you're typing or mousing... just
the ones which you yourself have chosen via the CLEAR key.

* Just as with any other char or escape code, you can't force Select past a
program which is already using that window. If you have Basic09 in W3, for
example, doing "display 1b21 >/w3" from another window will hang until you went
to W3 manually and hit ENTER a coupla times for basic09 to let the code make it
thru.

* Other rules. I'll go into detail later. I think the previous msg will help if
you study it some. Let me know what you figure out - kev

Yeah, the folks who use OS-9/68K in the field must NEVER play games, 'cause
there are just so darn few of them for OSK.

That will change with the MM/1, though, because the graphics will give
programmers lots of incentive. And I hope they take advantage of the
sound/MIDI, too.

The GUI will look fundamentally like Open Look's latest version (see Open
Windows from Sun, v. 2 or better). Much much classier than Mac, Amiga, or
Motif.

I haven't seent he Amiga 3000's new windowing stuff yet, but I feel very good

For what it's worth... it's my opinion that the day when a company or a
institution that's trying to sell something can set up a BBS and be relatively
assured of market penatration is past, long past.

So, perhaps you're not getting the word out as you might have some time in the
past.  That's problem #1.

Second problem is the fact that every mother and her sons and daughters are
offering seminars and "short courses" and the like.  If I get less than 25-30
advertisements from folks hawking everything from management seminars to
courses a month in how to plug in a computer, I consider asking the post office
to check on the health of my postal carrier!

As far as the free magazines go... who's got time to read all they get now,
free or subscription? I need one more?  If I did, the chances are that I've
already started the process to getting it.  Besides... "free magazines" is a
code word that marketers use meaning "let me send you some slick & glossy
advertisements that we tried to disguise as a magazine in the hopes that you'll
read it."  Even beloved CompuServe used that tactic for years with "Online
Today", and have since at least changed the name back to what it should have
been in the first place "CompuServe Magazine".  Is your "free magazine" that
different from what I've described?

Don't mean this to sound like a shotgun blast, James, but having been involved
in the videotext industry for a few years, it's interesting to watch how well,
and how poorly, marketing efforts attempt to use telecommunications media such
as videotext.

Sucks eggs. The main bug fix is that WW now unlinks all it's little ram buddies

not much free cheese left either ! I haven't tried using all the other features

a partial CoCoMax clone in a pmode 4 screen which no one has ever seen ... each
tool (brush/erasor/etc) was a different program which loaded on the fly -
reason I built a 128K upgrade and wrote the first coco ramdisk driver for os9).

Yeah, built a 128K coco-1 for myself and a friend. Then DSL (and later J&R)
came out with commercial 128K upgrades, and DSL sold my ramdisk for L-I...
which is how I met a lot of people like the LR Tech guys at my first fest: they
knew my name from the ramdisk driver... which people had taken apart and used
to help write hard disk drivers with!

Funny thing is, I based my ramdisk driver on the hard disk driver published in
Kilobaud magazine by.... Pete Lyall's old boss! Small world, eh?

Actually, I didn't get the Gimix until about 1985. I was running on an 'E'
board 32K that I hacked to 64K, a Wordpak I, and a PRO systems 10 MB hard disk.
Prior to that, I had been running w/o the hard disk, but used a 40DSDD and 2
80DSDD's under Flex, using a borrowed VT-100 out of the serial port. Best
damned bit banger driver I ever saw was in FLEX... 9600 baud FDX, if I recall.
Before that...... nah..

Hi Kev--There are other windows opened in the calling procedure which aren't

I'm almost done with it but I dont like leaving odd quirks like this in the

Hi Scott!

Fred ships the PT with only 4 wires connected to the serial connectors. You
will have to add a lead from pin 1 (of J11, J12, J21, J22 on the board) to pin
8 of the appropriate serial connector.  If you call Fred, he'lll send you a set
of jumpers.  Make up your serial cable straight through except reverse pins 2 &
3 on one end.

I only use STERM for CIS - I use sterm -f /t3
 t3 is my modem port, -f tells CIS to use B+ protocol for file transfers.

re UUCP/USENET

Read James Jones answer to you. Mark Griffith is working on a port of UUCP for
the CoCo.  When he's finished, I think he plans on porting it to OSK.

There is a version of UUCP already ported to OSK.  This was done by the TOP
Group in Munich, Germany.  I haven't gotten it to work and I don't know anyone
in the US who has.  Documentation is sketchy and written partly in German.  The
source code is not available.  TOP UUCP is part of a set of 15 discs.  This is
their Release 2.  In addition to UUCP, they include some games (which I haven't
tried) and lots of neat utilities which I do use. They also include a new
'Bourne' shell (I haven't tried it yet but I do use their older 'C' shell which
is great).

This software is public domain.  I've agreed to help distribute them in the US.
I can send you a set if you want for $50.00 (to cover copying costs, shipping,
etc).  I can provide them on 3 1/2 or 5 1/4 discs.  The format is MIZAR (some
of the discs will not fit on standard OS9).  In your /dd/CMDS/BOOTOBJS
directory, you should have a driver 'x0' which is the MIZAR driver.  Use that
or dmode /d0 and set tos to 0010.

USENET is a collection of systems, mostly running Unix, that communicate via
phone lines and ship news around.  UUCP is the name of the program, under Unix
at least, that is used to send files between machines.

To get an account, find a system that is on USENET, and ask the system
administrators if you can have an account.

 Hi all... Is it possible to use attribute bytes (as when programming in RSDOS
assembler) to control the look of text in an OS-9 assembly program? Are the
attribute bytes part of the hardware? Are they still there (accessed by display
codes) or is text handled in a completely different way? Would sure be handy -
in my program I have text already printed that I want to highlight selected
sections of, but I'm not sure how, other than rewriting it. I guess using attr
bytes would mean cheating, unless someone wrote some kind of program to access
them so one wouldn't have to write directly to screen (though the access
program would write directly...). Hmmm...
 Is there an easy way to set up a text screen, VDG style, so that the process
can write directly to it and do it 'legally'? Albert Marsh 76234,2740 uploaded
a set of Basic09 procedures that I think do something very similar, but I've
had trouble making it work. I think he uploaded it as fastes.ar. The B09 file
is called LoadSave.B09. Any ideas? Would definitely make things move MUCH
faster - I know, cause I'm porting my RSDOS assembler program to OS-9 and
finding OS-9 unacceptably slow, even using all the tricks I can find to make it
faster (buffering large amounts of screen data before writing it). The program,
under RSDOS, was great. In OS-9, it falls a bit short... So far anyway...

Glen - Not sure about the attribute question... do you mean to cause the
listing to be highlighted? If that's what you mean, then probably not.

If you just want to see part of a listing, you can embed OPT directives for 'l'
and '-l' to turn listing on and off.

Re: writing to VDG screens... I believe so. You can use a i$getstt call to get
the base of screen memory, and then use that as a working pointer for your
operations. Again, that's VDG only.

Hi Pete... Here's the situation: I have a screen full of text. I want to search
through the buffer it was written from for a match to a string of bytes (ie.
FF00). When (if) a match is found, I want to highlight the text on the screen.
 Thing is, I don't want to use a VDG screen if I can help it. Y If what I think
is correct, I can't use overlay windows on a VDG, right? If I can't use overlay
windows, the whole thing gets pretty tough. Hmmm... It used to run without them
under RSDOS, and worked well - but expectations were lower then. Maybe I'll try
it with a VDG screen and see what I think...

Getting out of my territory here.. the winders gurus are Kevin, Mark, and that
crowd. I believe your assumptions are basically sound though. I don't know if
there's a way to manipulate a non-VDG window in the way you describe, without
cheating. One possibilty: have a look at VEFIO in the DL10 area... it does some
organized, controlled cheating (if there is such a thing) along the lines
you're working with.

still low,( the green light is off on tester). Both RD/TD are RED. I also
swapped pins two and three. Wow, I am having a real problem, Please help me out
<grin>.

If you're talking about a typical DB-25 connector, pin 1 is frame ground, and
pin 8 is CARRIER DETECT. Better you should jumper 20 to 8 and 6. Pin 20 is Data
Terminal Ready (DTR), and comes up when the port is opened. This pwill cause
DCD (8) and DSR (6) to become true every time DTR comes up.

See SERIAL.TXT in DL2 for additional info.
