I suspected the buffers weren't saved as I had about 16K less available memory
after quitting the game. Is there a chance you could do an ipatch file to fix
it?

I could try an ipatch.  However, it would take adding some code so I don't know
if an ipatch would work.  I'll have to get out the ipatch docs.

All you need is the "sister" program to IPatch, MakPatch, to make the IPatch
file from a "before" image and an "after" image.

Hi Floyd... Love Tank and Gem, but there is a serious bug in Level 15 of Tank.
When I extend the bridge, the game dies with (I think) an error 55. How come?

Well, there was a problem with the level when I first created it, but I fixed
it.  However, I must have fixed it after I archived it together.  I'll upload
the corrected level.

Jack,

You may want to go to the Hot Topics library here and download the specs on the
MM/1. IMS is Interactive Media Systems, Inc., a North Carolina corporation that
has introduced a popular new 6800x0 based computer system that is being used to
develop a lot of stuff that will be of GREAT interest to PT 68kers.

My phone number at the DC office is 202 232 4246.

OK, Paul.  Will do.  I doubt I'll be interested in buying a new computer, since
I just bought the PT68-K4, which is working like a champ.  But I'm always
interested in anything that stimulates the use, and particularly the
development of nice software for, the 68000.

Thanks for the lead.

Well, you're getting the OS about as inexpesively as our customers are.

Because we have a pretty big market ready for the machine, we got a good bulk
discount. OTOH, no one can beat your price .... ;)

Stay tunes here for some pretty neat OSK stuff in the next few months.

Paul, for the record, I _DID_ pay for OS/9.  It turned out that PT had sent it
to me by mistake, thinking I already had the version for the -K2.  So rather
than send it back, I went ahead and paid for it.  Good price, tho: Just $299.

To: Jay Truesdale 72176,3565 (X)

Jay,

        Writing an auto-baud detect TSMon is relatively trivial. The way I
handled that on the CoCo was to basically write a standard TSMon.  Once that
was working the way it should be, I added the CONNECT strings into the vsect
and then used a string compare routine. At the very basic level, I had it sit
in an I$ReadLn state waiting for a string. Once it gets a string it compares it
with CONNECT. If it isn't CONNECT (use a fixed string length compare, like
strncmp() in C), throw the string in the trash and loop to the I$ReadLn call.
        If it is CONNECT, compare the next character for a space or carriage
return (or carriage return and line feed). If you have a CR, it's 300 baud.
Otherwise, compare for 1200 or 2400. I even set it up so that it sent an
initialization string to the modem when it started.
        There are a couple of gotchas with this method. First and foremost, the
6551 ACIA in the CoCo shuts down the receiver section if DCD or DSR is low. If
your modem sends the string before bringing DCD high, it won't work with the
6551 (unless you cheat and strap DCD high). Some modems do it right (bring DCD
high and then send the string and, finally, change baud rate to match the
caller) while others do it not-so-right (send the string, bring DCD high, and
match baud rates).
        Keep in mind, the reason I send an initialization string to the modem
is two-fold. First, it makes absolutely sure we *know* the modem has matched
baud rates with us. It will then send all strings at this baud rate. (Nothing
like receiving CONNECT 2400 at 1200 baud while ACIAPAK is set for 300 baud.
<grin>) Secondly, it helps the user so he knows the modem is setup properly for
auto-answer, connect strings, etc. I don't recommend using numeric result
codes. The reason is that the codes are 1 or 2 bytes (0 through 15 or whatever)
with no carriage returns and ACIAPAK blocks on an I$Read if no data is pending.
Is that code a 1 or 10?

Jay,

        By the way, I don't have the source code to the version of TSMon and
TSGo I wrote years ago. But I have placed it in the public domain so feel free
to disassemble the executable if you want to see how I did it. Granted, it's
not the best in the world but it is very short and should be simple to
disassemble. I don't expect it would take more than a couple of hours to write
a similar version for OSk.
        And keep in mind that I wrote TSGo so you could use the KillSwitch in
the descriptor. This way all processes with paths open to /t2 will be killed -
but since TSGo doesn't have any paths open,  it can refork TSMon as needed and
keep the system alive. It's also handy for reinitializing the modem and paths
to make sure everything is clean for a new round.

Are the termcap library functions avail here for the MW-6809 complier?

I know that there are some termcap entries for the CoCo, etc. But I can't seem
to locate the actual functions. Hmmm, are they part of the Krieder library?

Bob,

I believe if you look in LIB 7 you'll find some termcap files, probably only
the library and some docs.  If you don't, let me know and I'll upload them
again.

A word of caution -- the CoCo termcap libraries are flaky from my experience
with it.  OSK version is much more solid.

Paul,

Right now, I have no idea what happened to the file.  Those .CAT files are over
a year old, and should have been pulled a long time ago (they're gone, now). 
It's likely that the file had not been accessed in over six months, and was
removed in one of our periodic purges of the library.

Perhaps someone will have it available, and will reupload it for you.
