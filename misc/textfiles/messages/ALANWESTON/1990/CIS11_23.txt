kev,
 I'll be interested in how this thread turns out. I've got Orc-90 and find that
to use it, I must switch my MultiPak. I'd love to be able to run it from OS9.
 If Lee is listening, I have found that D.L. Logo has a MUSIC primitive that
plays multi-part harmony. It somehow gets more than 2 voices out of the CoCo.
Doesn't sound as good as Orc-90, but is pretty interesting anyway. D.L.Logo has
been interesting anyway.

Yes, you can use those drives on the coco, as 720K only.  As 1.4meg, they'd
require a controller with some crystal mods and perhaps some other hacks (dunno
for sure what all would be involved).

I think they all either have jumpers, or most may automatically drop down to
720K mode because the diskette HD hole would be missing.

I know some here are using these drives... how about it guys?

Rex - As Pete mentioned, chd & chx refer to a disk location, not to a directory
name. This is a major source of confusion for new users that OS9 manuals should
really explain.  You're not alone in running up against this one! But once it's
understood, you're home free.

When you "chd zzz" or "chx zzz",  OS9 looks up WHERE that directory zzz is on
THAT disk, and records pointers to the device and disk location (sector number)
in a table for that process.  This makes relative lookup (default or "../this"
or "that" quicker. But they're dependent upon where things are on that
particular disk.

So if you switch disks on OS9, and try to use default paths ("load basic09",
"basic09", "list startup", "pxd", etc), OS9 will try to start from that proc's
default location information... which of course is usually totally wrong for
any new disk (except identical backups).

It's sorta like showing someone a map to your house... once they know where
landmarks are on THAT map (disk), fine.  But swap maps, and they get confused
until they start looking all over again from the beginning.

The solution is simple: either temporarily "chx" or "chd" (depending on what
you're doing) to the new disk's directory names... or use full pathnames. When
you're quickly swapping a disk for one thing, full names are easiest:

    load /d0/cmds/basic09  (to keep in memory, and "basic09" to start)
        or
    /d0/cmds/basic09       (to start, but not keep when exited)

The first case assumes you have "load" in memory, natch.  The errors you got
should make more sense now.  Except 244. Dunno on that one. - kev

 After much run around, I got an exchange. One woman at RS called up Texas and
ordered an exchange. I had already gotten a promise at a store cross town for
an immediate exchange. When I told the woman at my RS store, she said, "They
can't do that." She told me I would have to wait a week. I said, "no way! I
paid 80 bucks for that software and I'm not going to wait a week when the guy
on the way to work will replace it today." She was upset because she had
already ordered the replacement before I told her I wanted it and now she'd be
stuck with an unwanted copy. She called her manager and he told her to let me
do the exchange.
 Anyway, I got a replacement that I'll try tonight. I can do a "dir" on the
disk, including in the "cmds" directory. I have one old drive that I got when
there was only CoCo1s. It works great with everything else, so I don't suspect
it.
 Thanks for the help. After I try the disk tonight, I may be back on my knees
here pleading for more help.

kev,
 I haven't had much problem with my disk drive since I upgraded to a CoCo2 and
now a CoCo3. Everything seems to work just great except that Basic09 disk. I
got my replacement and tried it last night. The new disk is formatted, but
totally devoid of files. Back to the drawing board. I'm going to go to the same
RS store and ask them to let me exchange for yet another copy, but try it out
on their demo model first. Actually, I don't think they keep their CoCo3's
running anymore. Is Tandy totally giving up on CoCos?
 My disk drive experienced a lot of problems when I first bought it. Finally it
ceased to work at all after about 1 month. By then my CoCo1 was just about shot
and I gave it to my brother-in-law and bought a CoCo2. That CoCo1 lasted me
about 4 years. My brother-in-law ended up throwing it away when he couldn't get
it working. Now he's an IBM nerd. My disk drive wouldn't work with my CoCo2 at
all until I got the Multi-Pak interface. The disk drive sat on the shelf about
2 years before I discovered it would work with the MultiPak. So even though it
is old, it hasn't see a lot of action until recently. I figure it still has a
bit of life left in it, and as I said, never flinches at the other CoCo3
software I have acquired, just Basic09 disks--all of them so far. Just looks
like I'm having a bit of bad luck with old store copies.

Hmm -

Wonder if the drive working with the multipak meant that you had an original

The multipak was a source of +12vdc.

Rex,

Email received a-okay. I'm puting together a package that hopefully you can
use. Without a hardware serial port (RS-232 pak or equiv.), I can not recommend
telcomming with OS9. I'm gonna send what I have in the way of RS-DOS terminal
programs, some utilities to move files to/from RSDOS, PCDOS, and OS9, and a few
other assorted goodies to get you up and running.

On your Basic09 problem, there is one possibility not addressed, yet. If your
"CoCo1 drive" = FD-500, you *might* run into disk problems. Some of these
beasts don't take kindly to the CoCo3's 2mhz speed. I'm not saying that is your
problem, but the potential is there.

P.S. It will take the disks a while to get there. You *would* have to live in

 Thanks for your help. On some future payday, I'm going to try and get an
RS-232 pak. Everyone seems to need one eventually.
 My Basic09 problem is getting worse. I convinced a RS store to replace the
disk. The new disk was formatted, but totally empty. Thats what I get for
getting into it so late, all the disks are experiencing software rot. My FD500
disk is doing fine with all of the other CoCo3 software I have been getting,
just not that lousy Basic09 disk. I've got a new copy coming from Texas.
 The opposite corner of the country is the most beautiful. Come on out some day
and I'll show you the sights. When I'm not at work or home with my fingers
glued to my CoCo3 keyboard, you can find me hiking the Pacific Northwest or
sleeping in a snow cave. Which corner of the country are you in? I spent two
weeks in Florida at the end of October. Disney World is just the place for a 34
year old kid like me.

Hughs, Xerox, Sun, TRW, DEC, Apple, and many other for-profit companies are on

wanted on.

There are also commercial Internet networks that receive no government subsidy.
Alternet is $250/month 9600 baud slip connection, (always available) or
$2500/month for full T1 (1.5 Mbps).  Add appropriate telephone line costs,
which vary widly.  (Slip may be done on a normal phone line.)

Like I said, even if it manages to reach the theretical maximum, it isn't worth

The "magic incantion" assume you have set the default protocol to Kermit and
the default editor to Edit.  Send the string "REPLY mes#<CR>"; in this case
mes#=7994.  Option #1:Then send "/UPL<CR>"; upload your message. Option #2:Then
send your message text.  To send as ASCII the lines must end in hard <CR>s,
XON/XOFF must be used, and MNP is suggested.  Dependent upon how the message
text ends, the string "/EXIT<CR>" may need to be sent.  Finally send
"POST<CR>".

Notes: Other forms of the above commands may be used to upload messages.  It
helps to use an editor that will insert the <CR>s.  Also, this entire procedure
can easily be automated in macros.

To: all

I do think getting together a group of os9/68k manufacturers, software
developers, and users together to create standards for areas that Microware has
ignored is a good idea.  This should include both hardware and software. 
Hardware may need support in both the dirver level and the applications
software to take full advantage.  Software standards are needed to make sure
programs don't prevent use of each other and to make sure they can be used
together.  A readily available library would also be a boon to software
developers.

One of the first things this commitee should do is grap a portion of the "user"
space in each of the areas that microware has split between system and user
spaces.  Signal numbers, error codes, and status codes are among these.  This
does not mean that they should be assigned fast, just reserved for future use.

A few things I think this commitee should look into:

Setstat code for drop dtr.

Better login program.  (Encript the passwords, root should NOT be able to
examine users passwords.)

Non-root accessable data about users.  Preferably with the same programmer
interface as unix getpwuid, getpwuid, etc.


I have ported and written quite a bit of software for os9/68k that is freely
available.  (Source code only, of course.  I do not distribute binaries.)  Soon
to be release is my unix-compatability library, which does cover the getpw*
routines, and my own login program will follow.

Developers of free software should not be excluded, a lot of the best software
on os9 is free.  (What terminal programs do you use on os9?)

Users should be allowed input as well.  We don't need another standards
committee that ignores what users need.

Kevin- saw your activity on the Atari ST RS232 problems (STSIO), and had some
info I thought I'd pass on. From discussion(s) with Bill Brady about a year ago
I recall mention of a problem(feature<gr>) he had heard of with the 68901 from
Motorola. As I recall there was a addendum to the spec sheets that said you had
to clear the data registers after changing the setup(or some such thing). You
might want to give him a shout. Other info- the 68901 has (4) interrupt vectors
dedicated to the USART $9-xmit error, $A-Xmit Empty, $B-Rcv error, and $C-Rcv
Full. Also Atari uses (3) GPIP ports for CTS,DCD, and ring. The driver STSIO
uses Xmit Empty and Rcv Full and disables xmit error. Haven't looked deep, but
it appears to rely on ROM routines for XON/XOFF and ???? Hope this is of some
help.

ps. any luck with def files for the (tiny) effort<grin>.

Kev, I used dEd and renamed cc3io to xc3io as you suggested.  The computer
booted up just fine this way. Using dirm, xc3io appeared where cc3io used to
be.  I have one problem however.  I haven't found an order for os9boot that
works?!  I think I remember reading that os9p2 and ioman have to be the first
and second module in os9boot.  Is this true?  If so, why? Regards,  Bill

Bill - if it booted with "xc3io", then it must not be using that module. So
it's something else that's going on... I take it the bootfile idents okay?

Ummm... no, I don't think os9p2 has to be first in the file.. nor any other in
any order.  Once the boot is loaded in, os9 verifies and enters all modules in
the mdir, and finds them by name.  The only exceptions are pre-boot-load, when
DOS jumps to REL, and REL calls OS9p1/Boot.

OSK is slightly different: "kernel" seems to need to be first.  Makes sense for
it, tho.

Does os9p1 show up on an mdir, btw?

~ The reason why I say you can't get more then 64K is when OS9 boots up it
grabs 64K for the system modules, data tables and so forth (Smap shows it) The
initial shell will be in the other 64K map. (leaves 56K if VDG or 48K if GFX
screen) using /t2 as the inital screen will leave 56K. OS9 Level II switches
maps when you access drivers & syst m calls. this 64K map allows for space for
data tables for OS9 internals. (Thats why some people get #237 errors when
Mfree reports plenty of memory) If you do not have Kevin Darlings "Inside OS9
Level II" book I strongly suggest it. He describes how the memory is set up for
Level II OS9.

I have tried in the past to put Shell and/or GrfDrv in the boot. OS9
automatically re-assigns it to a second map and won't appear in the 64K system
map. (using Kevin's utilities to see)

John - Since you have a Disto HD host computer adaptor, you are using either a
SASI or a SCSI interface to your MFM drive.  (MFM and RLL are analogous to
single and double density on a floppy drive, and can be used with SASI, SCSI,
506/412, and other interfaces, even though some mail-order ads imply otherwise.
SASI/SCSI define the electrical interface and commands used on that 50-pin bus
between the host computer adaptor and the drive controller.)

To check which version of the driver you are currently using, do an "ident -m
cchdisk", and note the CRC reported.  If it is $A1199D or $A50917, then you are
using one of the SASI drivers.  If it is $B7AA8D, then you are using the SCSI
driver.  If it is none of these, then there have probably already been some
patches applied, and you will have to give us a few more details about the
equipment in your HD setup.

Good luck... / Ken

Ken:

I checked this out just in time. I'm putting together a Disto HD system right
now. Will this patch give me true no halt? What would be nice, is to be able to
use Sterm's B+ option on the HD. I can do it right now with a RAM disk, but it
would be nice to free up the memory.

There are a couple of other things in the works that if they pan out may be of
some interest to a few, but until they fly I'm not getting too excited.

By the way. My drive is a Seagate ST296N 85Meg SCSI. Happen to know the number
of heads and cylinders on one of them? Looked through all the docs that came
with it, but they don't seem to cover this one. 65 is as big as it goes.

If it's ok to plug on here, Computer Direct has these for $360. (800-289-9473)
these guys have some good buys on stuff.

Jay,

 After some thinking, I think the real answer would be an inteligent shell
available (PD) to all. At least a widely useable Bourne shell.
 We use zsh, a commercially available programmable shell. What is relevant to
the issue at hand is the potential of making decisions in your .login shell:
 if (tty == "/term)
    setenv TERM hp2621
 else
    setenv TERM vt100



 or whatever you wanted to do. I'm not on that system, so I cannot tell you
exactly what mine does, but it is something like that.
 Oh, I just did a "head .profile" on my Unix system:
 case `tty` in
 /dev/tty52)
        TERM=5420
        break
        ;;
 /dev/tty77)
        TERM=coco
        break
        ;;
 and so on...
 This would solve a lot of other problems and complaints people have about OS9.
My purchasing zsh (which also has aliases) solved *SO* many complaints I was
getting in one fell shwoop.

Mark,

Using the "DO" command processor that comes with the Pan Utilities (from Delmar
or Windsor Systems) in your .login file might be able to do the same thing as
the more intelligent shells as DO can access the environment variables.

On second thought, maybe not as it would probably be run in a sub-shell and so
the changes to the environment might not make it back to the parent?

Any way the thought ocurred to me that perhaps MW wants to keep the shell 'lean
and mean' for imbedded applications, etc. which is what OS9 was meant for in
the first place.  Maybe they should have two versions, one for development
systems and one for imbedding in systems?

I considered 'zsh' and alternatives but never made the time to follow up on
them, especially since we got 'do' with the Pan Utilities.

Bill, the program works fine as far as getting menus etc., but when I follow
the instructions to download a voice from  the TX81, the screen shows a
Receiving data message and apparently locks up.  I tried the Receive Dump by
triggering the Cassette dump from the TX81, but saw no sign of action on the
CoCo side.  Reminder, I'm using the Rulaford MIDI.PAK. Lester Sands responded
to my query to him saying he believed it to be compatible with your editor, but
since he doesn't have a Tx81, he wasn't sure.  Your instructions to dump a
voice caused me to set the Tx81 in Play mode, set to a voice, select receive
dump, and inc or dec one notch to a new voice.  Doing that appears to cause
nothing to happen.  What am I missing??   All my effort so far is to receive
from the Tx81; once I can receive, then I'll explore sending to the synth. 
Your help is greatly appreciated.  Ches.

Ches,
  I am sending you a disk with the source and also the latest version I have of
the Editor, which corrects a few bugs that popped up. However, I never did
around to fully debugging the error messages, so that part is still flakey --
just don't make any mistakes!!!. I used this version all the time and never had
any problems with it. The disk is a 40 track disk, so If you don't have a drive
formatted for 40 tracks, you should copy these files over to one of your disks.
If you write anything to this disk with a 35-track drive, you'll destroy it,
but you can read from it with no problem. You'll have to copy the files one at
at time, as you won't be able to backup from a 40T to a 35T drive.

Enjoy, and let me know if you have any problems. The source code is from
EDTASM, so if you don't have that, you'll have to get a program to strip the
tab codes from the source so you can read it. There is such a program in the
Coco database here, authored by Mike Ward.

Good luck,

Bill

I just read your querry to Lester and I wonder this. If you're trying to use
the Editor with something besides standard RS disk basic, that might be the
source of your troubles. In order not to conflict with the 80 column screen, I
had to move the MidiPack driver to a low memory location. This could easily
cause some conflicts with OWL ware or someother basic. Let me know if this is
the problem.

I'll be happy to send you a copy of the source for the mididriver (It's
basicaly the one Lester wrote) and you can dink around with it if you want.

It could be memory conflict, I suppose.  I'm using a Disto controller that lets

Same results in all three, if I remember correctly. I'll check, tho, and let

~ Ok if SHELL and GrfDrv are in CMDS and both have the E and PE attributes on
start looking for other possibilities. Did you recently make a new OS9Boot?
Might have a BLOB problem. or as Kevin points out in his BLOB.TXT file have you
recently added something like a cordless phone nearby? Hard drives are very
sensitive to EM Fields and using a B&B system with 4 foot cables can invite
problems. I wrapped mine in Aluminum foil and covered it with duct tape and
that solved some spuratic read errors. if these check out OK make sure the hard
drive modules you load in to memory and the ones in your OS9Boot match up. (use
CMP on them) sometimes you may forget you changed something...

just throwing out some random thoughrs to hopefully nail it down...

Well, I think I discovered a problem.  What I did was add the modules necessary
for King's Quest III to my boot.  I had had them in the boot before but had
removed them to save on system memory.  However, this time when I added them I
got the FAILED message.  What made me thing there was something wrong was the
fact that before I add the modules, the system was not booting like it normally
did.  For some reason it was not merging in the standard pointers.  I have no
idea why - it always worked in the past.  Anyway, so the new boot disk did not
work.  Well, I found another boot disk and tried it.  It didn't work either. 
So I'm thinking that there is something dreadfully wrong.  Well, a couple of
days ago I found another boot disk for my hard drive system and tried it. 
Bingo!  Everything started working fine.  So, apparently, my problem was the
boot disk, and, because of circumstance, I thought it was something else.

Mike, I've now used the artics a bit, and the part-copy.  Thank you; those are

what drum machines or tone generators have you had experience with that would
work well with the percussion staff?  I just picked up a flyer on the Roland
D-110 which appears to be a synth that has at least as much capability as the
Yamaha TX81Z plus a percussion section that works with the added staff.  I
wonder what I could get for my TX81Z; or maybe I should use them both for the
better sounds from the TX (if any) plus the D-110.  A clerk at a nearby music

percussion staff.  Any comments??  Ches.

You can pickup used Alesis HR-16's in the $250 range (check the MIDI FORUM.. GO
MIDI). Also, in LA, new D-110's are going for $375, and used ones are in the
Recycler for as low as $300. They are a great machine, and I'd push you in that
direction. For $50-100 more than the HR-16, you get a synth assortment AND
reasonable drums sounds. Also, the D-110 is the 'LA' technology (Linear
Additive), whereas the TX81z is FM. Both are nice in the arsenal, and you can
NEVER have too much polyphony (voices). I'm a long time guitar player, but my
synth rack includes: Roland D10, Roland S-330 sampler, Kurzweil 1000PX, Yamaha
TX-7, and a Roland R-5 (drums). Don't get me started on F/X units, mixers,
gadgets, or my guitar stuff! (grin)...

Now that's really helpful - Thanks for the opinion.  I was leaning in the D-110
direction but wasn't sure how much of the flyer was accurate and how much was
puffery.  Thanks again.  Ches.

I agree -- $300 for a used D-110 is a steal! Ches, just to make sure you know
-- the persuccion staff in Umuse3 really does nothing that a regular staff
couldn't do. It sends out "note" numbers.  Its advantages are that you can
input percussion parts more easily, but most import, it makes for STANDARD
interchange between different synths and drum machines, none of which map the
same percussion sounds to the same "notes."

Anyway, use the hand keyboard test I mentioned before to check out anything you
want to use a percussion sounds. BTW, the percs on the Roland MT-32 (precursor
of 110 and such) sound really GREAT.  Full and clear.  Sampled, in essence.

CHes, to expand on my porivate email answers -I don't know much about the
TX81Z, except it's worth hanging onto for other sounds.  The synths I've played
percussion on are the Casio MT240, Yammie PSS480, and Roland MT-32.  All use
one channle for percussion, and put different "instruments" for different note
"pitches."  Maybe the TX81Z has only "tuned" percussion isnstruments, each of
which can play a whole scale of notes, and eats up a whole channel per
instrument, just like regular instruments.  If so, the Perc Clef won't help
there.

Test the HR16 or any other synth in the store:  Hook a MIDI keyboard's output
to its input.  You should be able to hit all the various perc instruments by
hitting keys on the keyboard, without using any "splits" or other tricks.

If so, it will work with Umuse3 and its Perc Staff.  Glad you like the new
features, heaven knows I do! --mike k

Hi Tom - if you don't own a Disto SC-I or SC-II disk controller, then the 3-1
board would have to go in a special adapter card from them.... which yes, would
work in a multipak.  Ummm, might need to run an interrupt wire into your
computer tho, from it, as the floppy controller is gonna steal the main slot
select on the MPI.  I can't recall if it needs a power pack or not... I'd guess
yes for the RS232 port.  Anyone know?  I can't find my docs.

If you are adept at writing your own os9 drivers, you might give GCOM in

have a very good X25 package that includes drivers for that chip, but you'll

fact, any extra memory you give them at birtth (Shell+ effectively does a #8K
with every command) deducts from the memory they can request later and use --

Hi -- yes, I guess new houses need new pipes too. Let's see, you mean a VDG
window converted from a real L2 window with a xmode type=01?  Error 37 means it
can't get the 6K grafix VDG screen allocated, which thanks to a bug or feature
in L2 that 6K has to come out of System Memory, a precious commodity. Do you
have a lot of other windows open, or Ramdisk, or other things that use up
system memory?

The buyware version does not take its grafix screen out of system memory, so
rarely if ever has the problem you mentioned.  Other things that eat up system
memory are Pipes and device drivers that are active.

Make sure no other procs are active, then start up Umuse, then restart the
other procs.  Turns out that 6K or RAM has to be contiguous too. Hope you get

OK Ed, good message. There is a nationwide (worldwide) Coco mailing list forum
out of Princeton U. where we have been discussing many aspects of the OSK
grafix interface, at the basic system level, having already decided (like you)
to leave the user interfaces for later.

Kev Darling is involved in these ongoing discussions, and I think we're getting
to the point where we'd like to see the same ideas and standards ported over to
your VGA grafix system.  We're trying to make it very platform-independent,
both for future "KMA" boxes and for backward compat'ly with Atari and Amiga.

I got the idea at the Fest that you weren't into the new OSK windowing and
grafix "standards", but if you're interested, great!

Since Kev is essentially defining the standard, with lots of our input, you
should stay in touch with him directly.  I think he should write screen drivers
for your VGA, and thus be prepared for OS9000 on the 386 PClones.

Since both IMS and FHL will be using his grafix system, it seems that what you
most need from a "consortium" is to join in the fray with Kevin and see what
he's doing/proposing and make your own views known. There's already a sort of
consortium -- jump in and get your say.

Do you have access on any academic or industrial host machines to BItNet or
UUNet or the like?  Then you could get on Princeton's net.

How are you doing with the FCC hassle?

I have a loaner of a very early prototype MM/1. It's great, tho part of that
stems fromt the included 430M hard drive. I read in and ran the Dynastar
upgrade I got from you -- after some diddling with the 3.5" disk descriptors. 
Yeah, your docs better mention how to DMODE a disk to read your stuff -- there
are too many "standards" in the OSK world, grin.

I like busses and multi-porocessor systems -- used to design and program them
myself for Bell Labs.  SO I wish you the best on the TOmcat systems -- I hope
you can get the software to really take advantage of your unique hardware
capabilities.  Maybe I'll end up with a TOmcat too -- always did get good
service from you on software and such -- mike k.

The DMODE included with the QT and Tomcats has the capability to do things
like, 'dmode /d0 coco' which sets /d0 to read coco OS9 disks. Also Atari and
Mizar(stdd), Universal (univ), and standard OS9 (std) are supported that way.
Of course all the other params can be set too. This is nice if you own one of
our machines but if you don't as in your case our documentation on our DMODE
would be useless to you.

Perhaps now that MW has 'moded' we could add documentation for that.

Trying to maintain documentation on apps that run under OSK is like trying to
hit a moving target. Prpbably could do it with a readme file on the disk
though.

OK -- I have just plain DMODE, but ama gradually building up shell scripts to
zap /st0 and /d1 to various things. Took 1/2 hour last nite at the Coco Club
meeting to read somebody's 720 K 3.5" written on their Coco3.  Sheesh!  Anyway,
your disks should include the major parameters on the label -- I have written
"typ=0, t0s=10" on your Dynastar disk.

PS:  The 5.25" disk with Dynastar was totally unreadable on a Coco. Is it one
of the many OSK "standards"?  If so, maybe the MM/1 can read it (I have a 5.25"
hooked up to it, but only DS-40). Thanks for reply, mike k.

Mike,

The disks DO have what I consider the 'major' parameters on them. The DynaStar
disk (51/4") says on it 'Double Sided, 30 Track, 48 TPI, (30 of 40 Tracks)'.
The problem you are having is that it is a 68K disk and uses the 'standard' OSK
format that we have used for 6+ years. Microware came up with a numbering
system that has no relation to the disk format, ie numbers like 5W03 or some
such. They or someone should come up with a system to describe the format
without being confusing. The other problem you are having is that you are
presuming that your floppy driver is standard Microware fare and this is
probably not the case. We have had to provide extensive support in the form of
very flexible floppy drivers and a powerful dmode utility to allow our
customers to be able to read/write/format ALL the various formats available.

Putting the complete format information on the label would require a much
bigger label. We need to come up with a uniform way, better than MW's to put on
the label.

You should be able to read the 68K DynaStar disk on your MM1 as it uses the
standard OSK format and is 48 tpi (40 Track). There would be little point in
distributing OSK software in CoCo format would there?

FHL has always offered our software on whatever format the customer requires at
no extra charge. Without notice we distribute it on the 'standard' format for
whatever system it is being used on.

If you have any trouble reading it on the MM1 let me know, I'm sure we can get
it worked out.

Frank,

<scratching head>  But MW "standard" has changed, right?  That is, are those
disks y'all are talking about:

 single-density track 0?  which used to be standard (??)

And then, nowadays MW standard is to skip track 0 altogether.  I think I still
have a 3.5" disk from you that I could never read all these years on my coco,
either.  I've always figured it was single-density track 0, and that was why I
couldn't read it with my standard coco disk driver.

Kev,

The 'universal' format is NOT a standard, it is a 'type' of format that
hopefully everyone will be able to support. For a software house a common
format to distribute software is important. It doesn't really matter that other
formats are used by individual companies as long as at least one common format
is supported by everyone. With the advent of many new disk drives with
different capabilities and companies trying to get the most out of them this
would seem reasonable.

MW doesn't force anyone to use any particular format which has caused problems
for users. We can support the various formats although I would prefer to only
have to deal with one.

Mike was the first person that bought a 68K version of software and tried to
read it on a CoCo. He only tried this because he doesn't have a 68K machine
yet. We have been shipping OSK software on this format for years. Until I know
what format you guys are using and what you support how else could I proceed.

I bought the 68K version of FBU and neither the CoCo nor my MM/1 will read it I
did get it to work only because I have SDISK3.3-DMC (No halt version) and used
a DISKTYPE command to set my 3.5" to Standard OS9. I then copied the files to a
CoCo 3.5" 720K disk and then the MM.1 and the CoCo reads it.

The MM/1 in the 720K format uses the CoCo format.

Hope that helps out

OK Frank, I can see where the stuff wouldn't all fit on the album cover, grin. 
Let's see ... I read the 3.5" fine after setting Track Zero Offset to 10 and
type=0.  No success on the 5" disk on Coco, tho may try it on the 48 TPI I put
on the MM/1 just to see if it really is bad or not.

RIght now I just have to wait for the Term Cap abilities on the MM/1 screen

From what Mike Guzzi says the MM1 uses the CoCo format for its disk drives.
This is fine as we can supply 68K software in that format. Perh hum that last
word was bad and I can't backspace... oh well. Perhaps we should use the
universal format for 68K as MW did that so everyone (hah) would support it.
Does your MM1 driver for the floppy support other formats?

As far as I know, everyone's OSK (and many OS9) drivers can handle almost any
format these days.  CoCo, ST, MW, hi-density... whatever the floppy chip being
used is capable of accessing.

I think Mike was (certainly I was) simply wondering about the rest of the
details on the format you've been shipping all these years... that is, what was
the sector offset and track 0 density?

Nothing earthshattering <grin>; and nothing to do with any specific capability;
it was just that we two dummies couldn't get our CoCos to read those disks
(because we hadn't fully figured them out... which is why he mentioned that
perhaps more info might have to be placed on OSK disk labels ... maybe not).

James, the stuff you're talking about is along the lines of an Artificial

Coco3 and the C language. Playing "identically" is aided thru a standard hack
called "quantization", where you can reduce everything to 16th notes or larger
by throwing out time deltas smaller than 32nd or 64ths, etc.

More basic problem is getting your played notes into the right parts-keyboard
music is so anarchistic, with no limit on the number or identity or continuity
of voices, that it's a wonder what the $500+ programs for Macs can do.  --mike

No, shouldn't have to load the merged modules (gfx2 etc) first, or at least as
long as you had 3 copies on disk, each in a different order and name.... so
that whichever one is first called, all would come in, y'see.  Me, I just

'ar' uses an early LZ compression technique. Unfortunately, the 'ar' utility

Actually, I've got several systems that I could use.  I've got a boring old
MS-DOS machine, a Macintosh and several machines running UNIX.  If the code is
byte order dependant, the Mac would probably be the easiest to port it to.  If
I can get around the byte order problem, an MS-DOS version would probably be of
interest to more people besides myself.

Just out of curiosity, did anyone ever port OS-9 to the Macintosh?  How much
does a port kit cost from Microware?

David. The Ultrascience OS-9 for the Mac is not strictly a port. It is actually
a Mac application that translates OS-9 to the Mac OS. The advantage of this
approach is that it is very easy to install and use. On the other hand, you'd
likely not be able to write any systems modules for it.

David. If you can find a copy of BigT-ST, it works fine as long as you don't
change the port config after running the program. xmode it to 8 bits no parity
etc. In fact, someone had enhanced the program. I don't have an ST anymore. I
had two, gave one to Kev, the other to my daughter.

Thanks for the suggestions.  My problem may have been the sequence in which I
did things.  Are you saying that the correct sequence is to do the xmode and
then run the terminal program?  Do I need an iniz in there somewhere?  Would
this sequence work:

        iniz

Pete,
    I disassembled your cron, and found a change I would like to make. viz.
cron looks for the r0 module and assumes you have a ram disk if it finds it.  I
don't always initialize ram disk, so cron will error out in this case.  Would
you care to upload clean source, cuz I always feel somewhat perverse , like
spying, disassembling other folks' code.
    Or do you have other thoughts?

same program compiles and runs under msdos, unix and os9; os9 gives the
different results.  This is a democracy yes? We're outvoted. )  Its easiest to
patch my code, but ultimately the library should be revised.  I have source to
his library, but its several years old.

What are the suggestions here for how to patch existing OSK memory modules with
additional code that increases the module size.  Generally the executable code
portion of the module is in the middle of the module. How best to open up the
executable portion for more code, or whatever? I'm assuming that I'd rather
work for some standalone solution, not Traps for instance.  How do folks least
painfully work on the code?  Run through a dissasemmbler/assembler? Use some
unknown OSK binary editor directly? Use MW debug in some fashion?

Any favorite ideas.

If you're patching at all, then you must have already figured out at least a
tiny bit of the offending code already.  How large is the module?

I guess it depends on the tools you have, and what you're patching.

When I first started patching, I simply assembled the extra code.. which I then
merged onto the _end_ of the module in question... plus a few extra bytes where
a new CRC would be made, using Verify.  Obviously I also used debug (or a
program) to change some of the old code to jump to the new routines. This
method is relatively quick and easy.

Nowadays, I disasm the whole thing... but you have to get it into just good
enough shape so that adding code in the middle doesn't screw up something else
(like a table of offsets)... which means you have to go through the whole
module and look for stuff like that.  If the module is small enough, this can
be done fairly quickly, tho.

No matter how you patch it, the way to distribute the patches (if patching
something that's commercial, that is) is to use Bob Santy's MakPatch/IPatch
programs (see PATCH.AR in Lib 12).  They generate what we call "ipatch" files
(".ipc") so that anyone with the original code can insert/delete new code.

is DTR high from the computer or the modem set to ignore DTR?

I'm using my CoCo 3, hooked up via a Ken-Ton dual ACIA cartridge.  xmode output

modem settings, let's see... It says S21=0, which implies in particular that
DTR is ignored.  Perhaps I should change that...

"Introducing G-Windows, a complete Graphical User Interface for the OS-9
Real-Time Multitasking Operating System.  G-Windows lets you build a visually

function calls to create windows, menus, and a variety of input/output gadgets.
An application editor, G-View lets you draw screens with gadgets that link
easily in to your applciation program written in C.  What's more, G-Windows is
totally multi-tasking (all windows can be active and updated at the same time).
It is extremely memory efficient and can be ROMed for embedded systems
applications.

G-Windows will operate on any G-64/G-96 or VME bus 680x0 system running OS-9. 
Just plug in GESAPC's Graphics, mouse and keyboard interface card into your
backplane, install the G-Windows software and your system is ready to shine
with 256 colors and resolution of 640 X 480 and higher."

They've got a video available that they say is free.  Gespac 1-800-4-GESPAC.

developer's pack is for C programmers only, I believe.  Hmmm... I suppose
someone could write a Basic09 interface from that, tho.  Thx for the posting!

Ted,

Sorry so see you had problems with my ramdisk running on a CoCo. Since seeing
your message, I have tried ramdisk on my machine with cron and had no
difficulty.

I wonder if it is in the CoCo's implementation of F$MapBlk or F$ClrBlk or in
you version of cron. I the cron I have is by Pete Lyall and is downloaded from
here. It is edition 5 and has a size of $38D and a crc of $A6D46E. It
recognizes in turn /r0 and /dd. It also looks for /nl or /nul to dump its i/o
to/from.

If you could provide more information, I could try and run down why ramdisk did
not work on your CoCo with cron. (Did you have /nl or /nil in memory?)

Thanks for responding to my message concerning cron and your ramdisk driver.
Your message prompted me to start experimenting again and I've come up with the
following observations. When I start cron (i.e. cron -l&), and before cron
errors out, if I try to access the ramdisk I get an error 241 (sector error).
When cron errors out,after a minute has passed, I can access the ramdisk again
with no problem. The cronerrs file reports "cannot open /r0/sys/crontab". If I
try to start cron without forking (i.e. cron), and then press the Break key to
end the process, the ramdisk is permanantly scrambled. All I get is error 241
when the ramdisk is accessed. I have to deiniz the ramdisk and then iniz again
in order to use the ramdisk once more. BTW I have the same version of cron that
you have and I have no problem with cron when using Kevin Darlings ramdisk.

Here is another strange anomaly that I have noticed when using your ramdisk.
Recently I have been working on learning 'C'. To this end I use a simple
interface program called devsys that enables one to set the compiler
options,run the compiler and call an editor at the press of a key. I use a
version of 'cc' written by Pete Lyall that uses a ramdisk for all its files.
Ordinarily this combination works very well with your ramdisk. However I have
two boot disks, the only difference being that one has Vdgint installed and the
other one doesn't. When I boot with Vdgint installed I have problems with the
above setup. When 'devsys' calls 'cc' to compile my source code it errors out
with error 213 (non existing segment). However if I switch to another window
and call 'cc' manually the file compiles with no problems. Please note that the
existence of Vgdint in the boot has no bearing with cron not working

I couldn't even hazard a guess to what is going on. Right now the advantage of
the ease of calling and  removing your ramdisk outwieghs the above problems and
I thank you for supplying it.

Fm: Robert Heller 71450,3432
To: Any Force People

I recently bought a Force CPU-30 system with OS-9/68K (v2.3). This system has a
SCSI controller on the CPU board and the system came with a device driver for
an Archive Viper (2150) QIC-150 SCSI tape drive.  I purchased elswere a used
Archive Scorpion (QIC-24) tape drive and a Adaptec ACB-3530 SCSI to QIC-36
controller.  I've connected the Scorpion/Adaptec unit to the SCSI bus and
loaded the driver and descriptor for the Viper and tried to use the tape.  It
does not seem to work.  Nothing happens, except the system hangs.  I have set
the SCSI address on the SCB-3530 to 4, to match the address in the descriptor. 
Is there some reason the Viper driver won't work with a different SCSI tape
drive?  The system came with sources for the driver, so I can edit and re-build
the driver if needed.  I am not sure what I would need to change though.

Also:  does anyone have a program (for the Force CPU-30) that will scan down
the SCSI bus doing an Inquiry command and reporting what is found on the bus? 
Just to be sure that the address is set to what it should be and to see if the
controller board is alive and well (or at least talking to the bus).

Robert,
 Although SCSI sounds like a standard, the command sets supported by different
devices are different. Most likely, the Viper driver sends out a command
that the controller from Adaptec does not support. I would have honestly been
surprised if it *DID* work, they're so different. I'm assuming that you have
MW's stock driver (sbviper) that uses the module to avoid collisions
on the SCSI bus. If so, just get the docs for the Adaptec and change their
driver to work with it.
 Sorry to not be more help.

Mark:

    I have the docs for the Adaptec controller and I compared it to what I
believe the sbviper driver is doing and it looked like it should work...

    Since I have the sources, I guess I'll just copy the whole beast over and
go through it with the Adaptec docs and make sure the driver and the controller
are on the same wavelength...  The only other posiblity is either the board is
bad or I don't have the address set correctly.

Robert,
 I know this sounds dumb, but you need to be careful about SCSI termination.
Most SCSI devices are very picky about the voltage levels which are affected
by termination. Make sure you are terminated in two and only two places -
preferably on the ends of your SCSI cable. I must confess that this has
screwed me up (along with a blown "pico-fuse") numerous times when trying
to hook up different SCSI devices.
 FWIW, I have Motorola MVME147, OMTI 5400, Archive Viper, and Micropolis
Imbedded SCSI devices.
 Also, make sure you only have one device (and at least one <g>) providing
power to the SCSI bus. If you have none, there's your problem. If you have
two, I think you risk blowing something.

Mark:
    With the tape drive connected, the hard disk continues to work.  I'm
assuming that means that the SCSI bus itself is ok.  I do have a termination
connecter at the end of the cable.
    When I do a hard system reset (and when I power up the system), the tape
drive does an initialization (makes little noises and its light comes on
briefly). I'm assuming that the SCSI controller on the CPU board is sending a
general initialization command to everything on the SCSI bus.

Robert,
 Yup - if ANY devices on the SCSI bus work properly, you probably have it
hooked up right. FWIW, the tape drive does its little song-and-dance even if no
SCSI cable is hooked up to it when you power it up.
 Maybe the next step is to run through it with sysdbg and see how far you do
get. Remember, putting breakpoints in drivers (and especially interrupt
routines) will bring your system down. But then, that's what reset buttons are
for! You may have to power down to reset the SCSI device. If you can
re-assemble sbviper and place global symbols (end in ":") at strategic points,
it will make debugging a lot easier.
 Lots of luck!

Fm: Greg Law 72130,23
To: Kevin Darling 76703,4227 (X)

Kevin,

        I am at wits end trying to convert a "Universal format" disk. According
to the information given to me by Stephen Weller at Windsor Systems, the
Universal format disks for OS-9/68000 (3.5 inch) use 16 sectors per track with
a sector and track offset of one. Well, I've written this program that runs on
the PC-clone that reads CoCo format disks beautifully so I altered the source
code to change the track offset to one and 16 sector tracks. It reads the ID
Sector (LSN 0), the file descriptor for the root directory, and the root
directory entries just fine. But when I select CMDS from the root directory, I
get a bizarre looking file descriptor for the CMDS directory. The first few
entries look just fine, but when it gets to the created date it's set at 4/3/50
or something similar. Examining it closer, it appears there is one byte extra
in the file descriptor from somewhere. Yet, the segment list looks fine and it
jives with the filesize. In other words, CMDS/basic is supposed to start at LSN
8 and occupies 216 sectors. The file size is 55,xxx bytes and seems to jive
with 216 sectors. I figured if the segment list looks okay, Microware must have
stuffed some funny values for the creation date and the User ID is 256 (1.0?).
        When I look at the sector data at LSN 8 (CMDS/basic), the first four
values are $00,00,00,00 - I thought the header should be $4A,FC,xx,xx. I took a
peek at CMDS/runb and it's the same way. Is this normal for OS-9/68000
executable files? I've diddled the LSN values up and down and haven't spotted
anything yet - but LSN 9 has the string "Trap not installed" which seems to
allude to the fact that this must be CMDS/basic. It's a real bummer examining
all of this stuff at home on a PC with the 68000 system sitting on my desk at
work so I don't have the ability to run it through an ident or compare it
against a known good executable file.

Robert,

        I am using a method that doesn't require me to fiddle with the
interleave factor on the disk. I just tell the NEC PD765 floppy controller chip
to read Track 1 Sector 8 and it finds it for me. I did finally get the rascal
working last night. I don't know what the problem was, but the first few bytes
in CMDS/basic were always wrong while running in the C source debugger. I
finally exited the debugger and tried it ala-carte and it worked. That made me
a little suspicious so I started investigating the source a little closer and
found one of the pointers was getting stomped on causing the first four bytes
of my data buffer to get overwritten. Very strange problem and the funny thing
is that the debugger was telling me what was happening all along - in an
obvious way no less - and I ignored it. ;)
        I knew I was running into memory allocation problems - at least I was
always allocating new buffers without returning the old memory - but I was in
such a blasted hurry to get the program running so I could copy the files off
at disk. I'll have to clean up the code tonight to make it nice and tight. I
just wonder what format disk I'll receive next week. ;)

Greg:
    I know how those stray pointers/indexes can really screw you up in
interesting and bizzare ways.  I wrote this program to run on our DECStations
and the program had a bogus array index problem.  The wierdness was this: when
the program was compiled and run on a Sun4, it appeared to work ok.  It also
worked on the DECStations, when I was writing to a NFS mounted VMS disk, but
trashed the output file when writing to either a local DECStation disk or a NFS
mounted DECStation disk (differently trashed).  The problem was my bogus index
was walking on the buffer allocated and used by fwrite() and a different amount
of buffering was being used for different logical output devices and I was
randomly lucking out on the Sun and when writing to the VMS disk.

   You may want to try posting that message again and use the command:

   The UNF stands for UNFormatted....which tells CIS not to play around with

Fm: Mark Wuest 74030,332
To: all

I just tried to put my very first label in a "c" program to no avail. I've
never used "goto", and do not need it now. What I want is to put a global label
in so that sysdbg can be used to put a breakpoint in the code without having to
disasemble a rather lengthy function looking for the right place.

 Here's what my code looked like:
 if(a){
     dothis();
     dothat();
 }
 else{
 FOO:
     x = -1;
 }
 When I tried to find FOO in the symbol table with sysdbg, I could not find it.
When I tried to put a breakpoint at it ("b FOO"), sysdbg complained with
"breakpoint at odd address" and did not put one there.
 Ok, all you non-structured (and proud of it!) goto'ers out there, how do I put
a global label in a function? (We worked around it with a function that just
did the "x = -1" and returned.)

Sorry, but if you look close you'll notice that the C compiler output contains
labels of the form _<number> which do not appear in .r files corresponding to
labels, since they're known only in the function.

If you are determined, you'll have to do something like edit the assembly
language output, find the label that corresponds to FOO, and tack a colon on
the end to make it global.

I simply do a "load RSDos", just EXACTLY like dsave does a "load copy". That
way it gets loaded from your current execution directory which is wherever you
have done a CHX to. Isn't that the "OS9 concept"? The intention was to make a
utility command similar to dsave which used RSDos instead od copy. Which RSSave
does very well. You are the only person who has made such a comment about this
utility. You are also the first person to accuse me of "ignoring the OS9
concept". I don't think I am since the RSSave command works JUST LIKE the
standard OS9 dsave command.

With a decent sized hard disk and at least 1MB of memory, the 7300 isn't a bad
UNIX machine.  You used to be able to buy them for under $1000 and upgrade them
to 1MB/40MB for about $500 more.  It made a rather inexpensive way to get into

 Thanks I have that version. I bought the Alpha software BBS but was not

processes running when they are not needed therefore the farther into the board
a user goes the more processes are running the result is when two or more users
are on and I do a procs I get a long line of processes running resulting in the
user 3 not being able to do anything but change menus. I am usually a locally
written board which drops each program if it isn't using it. As for the
Gallactic game I got in touch with the writers and am now running a Version

playing the game at once. It seems to work very well. If you hear of anything

Paul - yes, one of the first things in a module is its size.

Tell ya what I'd do... write a filter which took the output of "mdir e", and
added up all the sizes.  Tho that wouldn't necessarily tell you much about
system mem usage, as some could be merged while others took up full 8K blocks
each.  Ahhh... I see, that info might be interesting, too.

Another good filter would be to ident all modules in memory to look for
problems.

Subj: COULD YOU ASK ON CI$?
Hugo,
 
Could you ask if anyone has ever gotten a hard drive 
made for the TRS-80 Model II to work on the CoCo (OS-9 Level II)?
 
I was given an 8 meg hard drive.  Supposedly it is a primary drive.  I *HAVE* 
Tandy's Primary Hard Drive Controller for the CoCo.  (Actually the thing is an 
interface.  The controller is supposed to be built in to the drive.)
 
Surely some must have tried using a Model II drive on the CoCo.  I have no 
docs.  When I plug it in.  The CoCo usually starts to boot OS-9 then crashes.
 
I was attempting to use the Level I CCHDisk driver and descriptors.
 
Be nice if I could get it to work.  But I need more info to do anything.
 
Thanks.

H0 to something else inside the module so os9 doesn't try to use it on boot.

If you do want to try it under L-II, at the least patch the address in H0
(remember? FFxxxx to 07Fxxx ?  See ST225.AR in lib 10 also (I dunno if it helps
or not).  I'll ask around... it's been years since someone asked this Q>

Hi Larry - it sounds like your machine needs fine-tuning for the 1-meg. You
know that resistor under the keyboard connector which you jumpered? People have
found that either putting it back to normal (or more often, using a smaller
value like 10 ohms) or using a small pot allows them to tweek things for their
particular GIME/meg/cpu.

Maybe someone who's done this can pop in and give more details.  Once things
get tuned, their problems have gone away (and MV etc shouldn't need patching).
Oh ... I assume you installed the new grfdrv, vdgint of course. best - kev

The error only happens on one data file for the raytracer, maybe the data file

Fmod(double x, double y) returns the modulus of to floats/doubles. Also, what's

Going via the trap libraries has an associated performance hit, but does have

Sorry guys!

     The problem has only happened for me with system names in the Systems file

more than a 6 character name strange things may happen.  Most of the time
uucico trys to write to stdout instead of the desired port.  It leaves the
window frozen on exit.  I have made the fix and am awaiting Marks reply about
how to distribute it.

     The work around is to not put any systems in your Systems file with names
longer than 6 characters.

Hi Walter - see message #7993 here... it answers the same question.

Do you have two drives or just one?  If two, put the disk in the other drive
and type "dir /d1" and "dir /d1/cmds"... you should see basic09 in there.  Then
just "load /d1/cmds/basic09".

Maybe this note will help some of you new OS9ers.

BASIC09 and all of it's related files are located in the "CMDS" directory of
the boot/config/basic09 disk as distributed by Radio Shack.

The manuals do not always make it clear that executable files (programs,
commands, procedures) are placed in that CMDS directory

This seems to confuse a lot of newcomers until they get used to OS9's use of
two(2) current directories instead of one(1) as in MSDOS or UNIX.

Thanks for all the responces to my OS9 question... I`ll give them a try as so
as  I am home and on my CoCo again!!!!   I still would like to know if it is
possible to run the BBS I wrote in basic on OS9.  Have the additional speed
would be nifty, and as some of you have said, I really have no desire to look
at RS DOS again.   I started out as a pascal programmer, and have some Z80
machine language background so RS basic was always troublesome...  Then again,
it does usually do the job. The other problem I have now is with animation.  I
just purchased CoCo max III hoping to do ~animation" as promised in thier ad. 
Unfortunatly, though it is a good program, when they refer to animation they
just mean flickering colors on the screen.   I would like to do cartoon style
animation (as in having many pages to write to and flipping pages rapidly) is
there anything like this available????? Well, I`m off to plunge back into the
wonderful world (and sorid manual) of OS9.  Wish me luck.  And THANKS!

Kev, at the risk of misunderstanding the essence of your comment, please allow
me to make an observation.  I use Kermit at work to transfer files from a
mainframe to a pc at 19.2 with pleasure at the speed.  I tried the CIS kermit
recently expecting to see an improvement and found it slower than xmodem! 
Perhaps the CIS implementation is inefficient?? Regards, Ches.

I'm no comm guru either, but I would expect kermit to be faster since it can
underscore can use larger blocks.  The work connection was through an internal
telephone system using codecs rather than modems, but functionally its the same
as dialing up thru a modem.  The available bandwidth is larger, or course, thus
permitting 19.2 transmission.  But even at 2400 or 4800, kermit seems fast at
work.  I say seems since I can't use xmodem or any ?modem there - only kermit
for file transfer - but watching the bits and bytes come through it seems fast.
In running kermit from home at 2400 on CIS, it appears far slower than xmodem.

Kev, CIS doesn't implement a very fancy Kermit. It suffers from the same things
that xmodem does in that each packet must be ack'd before the next can be
transmitted. In a packet switching network the size of CIS the interpacket
delays can be as long as the time it take to transmit a block sometimes. Add to
that Kermit is implemented with very small blocks (64 bytes I believe) and you
can see that it's not very efficient.

Full B-protocol is really the way to go on CIS especially since the sources are
available. Mark did a nice job of doing just that with Sterm.

Kermit defaults to using blocks that are about 94 characters. More overhead
than Xmodem, although other niceties make up for (i.e. no padding, etc.).

The CIS folks have acknowledged that their kermit is far from optimal....

Kev,
    Just to see if I understand this correctly, the extra bytes at the end of
an xmodem transfer is a padding so that the final packet sent is full?  ie.  if
the packets are 128 bytes each, and the final packet only contains 100 bytes,
xmodem fills in the remaining 28 bytes with bogus characters? Dave

Dave - as I understand it, yes.  I believe the default filler is ctl-Z's, which
is the old CP/M end-of-file character (if I'm wrong, I'm sure I'll be corrected
;-).

To get around that, the Mac guys came up with MacBin format... where the first
packet is a header with the real size of the file, and some other helpful info.
Bill Brady did a similar deal for the coco with CoCoBin.

Newer protocols don't add filler bytes (I suppose because the length is
specified in handshaking first??), and most people just ignore the older file
errors ... like when Ar or Ident etc cough on the extra junk.

I'm definitely not a serial guru.. but there's a bunch of those here. I hope

Kev, the newer protocols *do* fill. But they xmit the filesize as part of the
header. The host, *if* it implements the protocol properly, uses that to trim
the file. MacBinary and CoCoBinary are both designed to be transparent to the
host, it makes not diff what protocol is used. Right now the "hot" mode is
ZMODEM and MNP Class 5. That combo yields a 4x to 8x speed improvement.

You hit the nail on the proverbial head.  Xmodem was designed as a protocol to
ship files from one CP/M disk to another, and since CP/M doesn't know the
lengths of files as anything but the number of 128-byte sectors they consume,
that was good enough for it.

Nope--it's not CIS's implementation, save to the extent that it doesn't support
sliding windows or long packets.  CIS transput is via a network that introduces
some hefty delays, so that protocols that don't do what is called "sliding
windows" or "send ahead" take a major performance hit.

Ches, kermit works fine on direct connect, but lousy via a packet switching

printing the time and date.

    The reason is this : I am running a BBS, under RiBBS v2.0.  It allows users
access to shell commands.  It forks login fine and the user may enter their
name and password, but as soon as the shell is forked there comes up about 20
'ERROR #214' or 'ERROR #215' and then it exits.  Shell+ works fine with the
origonal ACIAPAK, but for some reason when it is called through the ACIAPAK
that is patched for RiBBS it is not happy.

    The original shell works for us, but it is not the same, as you may know. I
figure the printing of the time to be the problem because it appears to be the
only difference between the two shells on startup.  Any help would be greatly

Fm: BILL HEALTON 73367,357
To:  72300,1433 (X)

mike, OSK errors 1XX are generated by an unused vector #XX. Exception Vector #7
is defined as TRAPV. TRAPV is the instruction for "Trap on Overflow". 
Therefore :

 1) An Overflow condition is causing the exception and this condition was
anticipated by the C generated code(hence the TRAPV instruction).

 2) The lack of an exception handling routine causes the error.

If you understand the code or what to do on an overflow, you could install your
own handler, if not, you could simply try installing an RTI into vector #7.
There may even be a handler routine in one of the C-libs or CIO? If you wish to
determine  where the exception is coming from, you could install a routine into
vector #7 to read the stacked address and display it.

Hope this helps. Also if what you need beta tested could run on Atari ST/OSK I
would be glad to help.

You might just be correct about the math trap lib having it's own exception

Unfortunatly, I don't know enough assembler to modify vector #7 or to even

Before I gave up on the ST, I spent many hours troubleshooting the serial port.
It uses a MF chip. 68901 if memory serves. The chip includes all of the
interval timers and interupt decoding. The chip has several caveats for use.
For example, you can't change it's config if there is data in the read buffer.
The driver in the ST ROM apparently breaks some of these rules. We Atari
developers reported the problem to Atari many times. They never fixed it. TOS
comm programs get around it by using low level calls... they take over the
chip. This is not kosher for OSK, and in a MT/MU OS you wouldn't want to diddle
with the guts of CPU timing and interrupt processing just to reconfigure a
serial port.

The serial driver should not take over the chip. It whould be a conflict with
the kernel. Too many things go through the chip, like the keyboard interrupt.
The 68901 also controls all of the timing in the computer. What the ST needs is
a serial port that is not tied to the guts of the system.

program the individual sections/functions independent of the others. True some
of the timers are critical to video timing; but the serial portion with its
individual interrupts and registers could and should be handled by the OSK
device driver. The current driver does this by using TOS ROM calls; there-in
lies its deficiency. A properly written driver should never touch the TOS ROM
calls or any of the critical functions of the chip. I am currently working on a
keyboard/multiple screen driver that will be independent of the ROMs. It WILL
use some of the 68901, including one of the timers. The ke point is one must
understand the whole of the system to break out the parts. After I have
finished <if software ever finishes> I hope to get to the STSIO driver. I have
not yet run across the caveats you mention, but would appreciate any
information you have.

If I wanted to tackle the job of writing my own serial driver for the ST, how
would I got about doing it?  Is there a reference for writing OSK device
drivers?  I've done RSX-11 device drivers, but never OSK drivers. I can't
imagine that it would be much different though.

David:
    The OS-9 Tech. ref manual is pretty good.  There is also a book published
by Microware by Peter Dibble called "OS-9 Insights An Advanced Programmer Guide
to OS-9/68000", which describes an OSK serial port driver (for the 68681) in a
step-by-step way.  It is not really very hard to write an OSK device driver.
The only problem with the ST is I don't think the full ROM debugger is
included. While you could get SysDbg, it would be an added cost, but maybe
worth it.

Bill,
  Thanks for the response.  I knew nobody read Mac disks (even text files), but
didn't know why.

But what I'm really concerned about is software availability for OSK and that
software's compatibility with other software in other operating systems. I mean
using OSK spreadsheets, WP files, etc on a Mac or MS-DOS machine. From what
I've seen of OSK software to date, much of it is fairly old, command-key-driven
(like Wordstar) stuff.  If these new machines are going to sell, they really
need to concentrate on how their software is going to work and what else it can
talk to.

This is really an attempt to get Frank Hogg and Paul Ward thinking about the
subject of end-user software for their new machines and what it's really going
to do.  I'm sure they've already thought about it some, but all the info I've
seen here and in their sales brochures talks on and on about the hardware with
no real discussion of a new generation of software That's what I'd like to see
and what I'll have to see before I buy an MM/1 or TC70

Any other opinions? Randy.

Well, I am involved almost constantly in sharing files. I run one of only three
Macs in a Messy-DOS shop. Since OSK is a UNIX like OS, and there is really no
Graphics Interface, it works mostly in text. (like *Star). File transport is
not too great a problem. Remember, output can always and easily be routed to a
file. What we really need is a packege like SMART that sells for $149 vice
$895.

Bill,
  I was under the impressing that someone (Kevin Darling, I think) is
developing a GUI for OSK and that would be the main user interface in the TC70
and MM/1.  Do you know anything about this?  A GUI is a VERY convenient way to
get around an operating system and to work with applications and is the way all
software is going.  If OSK doesn't have something similar, I'm afraid it will
be left behind.  One of the advantages of the Mac is the GUI and the
consistency of "utilities" between applications.  If we're starting a new
generation of 68XXX machines with similar graphics capabilities, this kind of
consistency in software development may make them the first true competitors to
the Mac line.

  I understand that file transfer is as easy as you say between Mac and DOS
systems.  I do the same things every day myself.  But one of the things that
allows me to do it is the translators built into the software. From MacWrite
II, I can save a file in nearly 20 different formats. I feel that new software
developed for OSK must have some similar features so we can share info with the
rest of the world. To date, it has seemed to me that the OS-9 community has
been a relatively elite clique whose unity depended on being able to develop
high powered software on relatively inexpensive hardware.  If we're going to
expand beyond that, we need to be able to talk to the world.

As to SMART, I agree completely.  For $1400, it'd better wash dishes, clean
house, and have a built-in beer cooler.  I came to the COCO and OSK for high
power at low price.  If new OSK stuff is going to cost that much I'll get a
Mac.

Do you run OSK on your Mac?  I've seen the sales literature on it, but I'd like
to hear about the performance from a third party.

Thanks! Randy

Tony, I get an awful lot of phone calls re the 3 in 1 & Wiz. In many cases the
board transmits but does now receive. This is due to the interrupt not making
it to the CPU. I have not seen one, but I users have reported that they have
fixed the problem by soldering a wire between the satellite board and the main
board. Apparently the interrupt crosses via a single pin that pulls out when
the cover is put on... due to cables pulling on the board.

Cute, Bill. I really did like the Wiz, but I got lost between all the updates
and enhancements that I found on CIS and Delphi. However I disagree with you on
the fact about loosing characters on RS232. While I was using Osterm, I never
had those kind of problems. I only had lost characters with Telstar and my old
rs232 pak. Now I have a new rs232 pak as well as the diode hack.  There is
definitely something wrong with my old pak. Wanna hear something wierd, Since I
bought my 3 in 1 I can't get Osterm to even Dial my rs232 pak. In fact usually 
when I run Osterm now it hangs my system. So the only way I could get on CIS
was to use a borrowed rs232 pak and to go back to telstar (which has lots of
bugs). Boy do I miss Osterm! You can be sure I'll be calling to talk to you,
the people at CRC and Tony himself are no help at all. Kevin has been tryiong
to help me recently. But I think I am having more IRQ problems. I think my SCII
was working better with the .sleep driver. Looking forward to talking to you.

Any terminal program that uses ACIAPAK/T2 will loose characters above 2400
baud. No interrupt is required to transmit to the modem. The IRQ don't come
into play until until it's time to receive. If you have a TD or SD light on
your modem, try to see if it is blinking when you tap a key. (with your term
program running, of course.) If you don't have the lights you might want to
invest in one of the little RS232 "tateltales" that the shack sells.

the original shell+ 2.1, changed $130f to 00, then started a second mvcanvas. 
PMap shows the same amount of memory being used by each process.  What am I
missing here?
    Do I understand correctly that malloc() will grab memory until the 64k
process space is used, irrespective of whether I specify the full shot of
memory, either at link time or by the #XXk command line option?

Malloc() will grab memory until there are no 8K bolcks left in your proc's 64K
space, yes.  But first it will take whatever's left in the highest 8K block of
your original process allocation. Now here's the hooker: the way C's startup
routine works, and extra memory you give it on the command linea with #K (or
Shell+ gives it behind your back), that memory can only be used for extra STACK
space. [Read "any" for "and" above.] This memory is DEINIED to malloc(), which
always starts beyond your stack space.  Thus shell+, by giving your program
extra stack space, causes malloc() to start off with that much LESS memory
available.

It all makes sense now, after Greg Law and Zack Sessions helped figure it out
on the low-priced service (sometimes cheaper  is better, eh?). But it took 3-4
people to put all the pieces of evidence togehter. WHo says there's no science
in COmputer Science?  --mike k

PS: MVCanvas might *not* be one of the programs affected, maybe I was wrong or
was thinking of the older version.

~ This file I have to burn the kernal in ROM applies only to Level II since it
makes reference to REL BOOT and OS9p1 (level II modules) This file patches the
modules to allow them to come in from ROM and possibly to add the vectors which
would not be present without the BASIC ROM's. The file is a bit vauge and does
not tell you if ohis new ROM goes into the Disk Controller or inside the CoCo3.
I would assume inside the CoCo3.

I use Pete's Disk ROM. it automatically does a DOS command on power-up unless
you hold down a key when turning the CoCo on. This will work for ANY CoCo and
requires no patches to OS9 and still allows you to use RSDOS stuff as well. I
bought a copy of the code for $10 (I have my own EPROM burner) but he also can
do it for nou (will cost more of course)

I use it for my BBS. I leave my system disk in all the time and the CC3GO
module is modified to look for "StartupBBS" instead of startup to auto-boot my
BBS. (my normal startup doesn't boot the BBS) then to prevent a glitch on the
system disk (in case of power failure) i run the DPARK command on /D0 which
moves the heads to track 41 (the system disk is only 35 track)

Either method still requires OS9Boot on /D0. The only way around it is to put
the whole OS9Boot into ROM (undoubtly requires patches) and I have never heard
of this being done. Besides there is only 32K of ROM total (including tee disk
ROM) and that isn't enough.

Hi Michael -  you're probably pretty close... does a "dir /d1" (or wherever) of
the disk you tried to make readable, show any files?

If so, then you're in good shape.  Now copy the files over to a *real* OS9
disk.... where you can do more operations on them (the rsdos->os9 disk thingie
doesn't really make it a full os9 disk, so you must get the files onto a real
os9 disk).

From there, we'll have to give a little more help, I suspect... which will
depend upon which files you downloaded.  Some files are archived (compressed)
and need Ar (AR09.BIN in lib 9) to break out, some are ready-to-go (you'll have
to do "attr filename e pe" on those to make them loadable; and some may be text
files etc... just as with any computer downloads.

Let us know which files, and we'll get you rolling quickly as possible.

RE: UUCICO bug reports

Brett Wynkoop posted a report stating that UUCICO had a bug where any
sitenames with greater than 6 characters in them would cause all sorts of
garbarge to be printing on the screen and leave your screen and or port
locked when it finanlly exits.

This is not completely right -- if the sitename your are trying to connect
with is longer than 8 characters, this may happen.  However, UUCP sitenames
are supposed to be 8 characters or less according to my available
documentation.  Also, the UUSETUP utility won't allow you to enter a
sitename of greater than 8 characters.  Therefore, this should not happen.

Future editions of the software will be corrected so if a sitename greater
than the maximum is needed for some reason, no errors will occur.

Thanks,

Mark Griffith

Sb: shell+ 2.1
Fm: Marcelo Katzeff 72520,640
To: All

    Does anyone know a way to prevent Shell+ 2.1 from printing the time and
date as soon as it is forked?  I don't mean in the prompt but just before it is
ready it prints 'Shell+ v2.1 90/11/13 18:51:34'.  I would like to keep it from
printing the time and date.

    The reason is this : I am running a BBS, under RiBBS v2.0.  It allows users
access to shell commands.  It forks login fine and the user may enter their
name and password, but as soon as the shell is forked there comes up about 20
'ERROR #214' or 'ERROR #215' and then it exits.  Shell+ works fine with the
origonal ACIAPAK, but for some reason when it is called through the ACIAPAK
that is patched for RiBBS it is not happy.

    The original shell works for us, but it is not the same, as you may know. I
figure the printing of the time to be the problem because it appears to be the
only difference between the two shells on startup.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.    Thanks.

To: Midi experts

 I have been looking in the MIDI Forum for Roland D10 tone patches
 and have downloaded some. I thought that I could pick out the
 beginning of the system exclusive (F041 Hex) block within their
 format and trim off the rest. Is there any patch editors (or
 whatever there called) for OS9 or cocodos that are compatable
 with some of these other files? By the way, I found out that by
 using Lester Hands CMPRO's Syx Exclusive save of my D10 or U220's
 patch (or tone parameters) and then transfering that file over to
 os9, they can be ported to the syth by "copy patch.syx /midi". It
 works well, and it's nice to have a backup all those patches on
 hard  disk. And I can also load patches on another window for
 Ultimuse  use. Since this Syx Exc block goes from cocodos to OS9
 fine, I  thought that same formatted block would be somewhere in
 these other computer downloads. Has anyone out there done any of
 this stuff?
                     Thanks,   Fenton Hunt 75340,3527

There are no COCO/OS9 D10 editors that I'm aware of. Lots for the PC and
MAC/ATARI/AMIGA though. We do have some for the CZ series, TX81Z, and a few

Pete,

What I wanted to do was get some new sounds for my D10 without having rom card.
I thought that some of the d10 downloads would have an unmodified syx exclusive
message within that download that I could send directly to the D10 and change
the tone parameters. I'm not looking forcessarily to edit the D10 directly. Are
you pretty heavy into midi? Os9? Do you use CMPro? I'm hooked on Os9, but
primarily use Cmpro for midi stuff. I use Ultimuse sometimes, but find Os9 and
all the multitasking is a little hard on the timing of the music when there's
many notes going at the saOs9 needs a good sequencer program but that may be
impossible with 6809 Os9). I will be following the MM1 and it's midi software.

I have written and uploaded a few MIDI/COCO/OS9 goodies, but because of the
lack of commercial support, went over to a PC/AT type machine a long time ago
for the bulk of the MIDI software.

If the D10 dumps are straight SYSTEM EXCLUSIVE (the ones I put up there were),
then you should be able to send them a byte at a time to the MIDI port. A merge
command would be fine, assuming that you have a MIDI driver in your setup.
Otherwise, you could probably write a nasty little peek/poke routine that would
get the job done using the MIDI pack.

As an aside, you can get pretty good deals on sounds from Valhalla. They used
to offer a deal where you could buy your bank of choice on a RAM card or $55.
That's worth it just to get the RAM card. They also have a cheap ($3 or so)
tape that lets you audition all of the available banks before deciding.

Back to the SYSEX utility.... you may want to allow a bit of adjustable delay
in there as well... some synths can't handle a big dump at full bandwidth.

Pete

P.S. The Roland D10 dumps are of the format F0[data]F7 F0[data]F7 where each
packet is 256 bytes. You may want to check your files with a DUMP utility to
ensure that this is what you have.

Right you are: it gets much easier over time, and with more utils (the same as
with any computer)!  And we'll give help wherever you need it.

Okay, I'll assume that you have made an rsdos disk readable, and the disk has
AR09.BIN on it (and that you modem'd it down in binary, not ascii mode!).

Ummm, I guess we need to know how many disk drives you have; it'll make things
much easier if you have two (and 512K!). I'll go on the assumption that you
have two drives (correct me if you have only one drive).

 1. "load dir copy"  (to make sure they're in).
 2. Place an os9 disk with some room on it in /d1.
 3. Place the rsdos/os9 disk in /d0.
 4. "copy /d0/ar09.bin /d1/ar"  (this copies the file to os9 disk)
 5. Put your original CMDS disk back in /d0.
 6. "attr /d1/ar e pe w"  (this makes it executable and deleteable).
 7. If you wish (and have room), "copy /d1/ar /d0/cmds/ar"
    Or, just "load /d1/ar" whenever you need it.

Ar is now ready to use. Let's say you downloaded STERM1.AR and TRMCAP.AR from
Lib 7 for a term program.  To break out STERM1.AR, you'd do this:

 1. Copy the file to a real os9 disk (see steps 1-5 in previous msg).
    For example, "copy /d0/sterm1.ar /d1/sterm1.ar"
 2. "chd" to wherever you want the unarchived files to go, for example:
    "makdir /d1/STERM"
    "chd /d1/sterm"
 3. Give ar the extract command, using a full pathname:
    "ar -x /d1/sterm1.ar"

The files should end up in the /D1/STERM directory.  Some you will have to make
executable (with Attr), some you can just List (like the docs).

Note: if ar reports files coming out, but you get an error at the end, first
look to see if you got all the files the docs said you should. If so, ignore
the error... it's just modem padding on the end of the file. Oh, and Ar expects
an archive file to have ".ar" as the end of its name. If you need to, just
rename the file ("rename /d1/stermdownload sterm1.ar").

This will all become second nature to you after a coupla times, of course.

Thanks for all the helpfull info! With that and a couple of utilities from here
and the coco sig,
 I have solved most of the problems I was having.
 I did run into one glitch, though. Is there a size limit for files that DOSOR9
 will handle? I dow'ed TREK.AR from the coco lib.
 #9 and DOSOR9 wouldn't convert it. Every time I tried, the files on the disk
before that one were transfered o.k. but at that file, the program gave me an
FC ERROR at line something or other. The same thing happened when I did a disk
with ONLY that file on it.
 I still don't have a terminal program running on OS9. I got VTERM assembled,
and if I had a multipak and RS232, I'm sure it would work. I've been trying to
get a /t1-/RS232 combo together using together using BBANGR.BIN . I made up the
cable and put together a bootfile (ver. 02.00.00), but it did'nt work. I even
re-connected my COCO II and tried it with ver. 1.01.00. No dice. I get an
orange bar that moves across the screen (and stops) as the host transmits. The
VTERM doc's says something about a 6850 ACIA. I'll try other terminal programs
and hit the books to try to find a way to work BBAANGR.BIN in as a device
discriptor/driver on lev. II.
 Thanks again, and as always, any comments or suggestions will be greatly
appreciated.

I think the later DOSOR9 will handle up to 64K or so?  The FC ERROR is right
where it handles sector math stuff, and you might be able to figure out how to
make it go even higher (use more bytes for math).

But... this is what I'd do instead; which will take a little while to set up,
but well worth the results. Get:

 Lib  9: RSDOS.AR  - program to read/write/dir RSDOS disks.
 Lib 10: CC3DIS.AR - ipatch to create new driver for rsdos/etc command.
 Lib 10: PATCH.AR  - the ipatch program (if you don't have it already).

With ipatch you create the new cc3disk (from the original), then make a new
bootfile and reboot.

Now you can use the rsdos util under OS9 to transfer files from rsdos disks.
Very handy, and you can also use PCDOS.AR in Lib 10 to do the same with msdos
files.  Yell if need help! best - kev

Carl's at 71076,76, and doesn't get on too often these days. The 'make' he used
initially was his own. It should be available in the UGLIB DL. If it's not
there, Mike Ward probaby has it archived offline, and will be happy to upload
it for you (76703,2013).

Carl's 'make' was good (in a void), but I prefer the dev pak make. It's closer
to both Unix and 68k make's. There are also sources floating about (USENET, PC
Forums, DDJ Forum, etc.) for public domain make's, so you could also roll your
own if you like.

Hello again,

Non-Blocking keyboard read? (like inkey$ in basic). At the moment, I am using
getstat(1,0) to chec to check if there is something in 'stdin'; if there is i
use fgets() to read thin one char at a time. The problem with this is that a
need two returns '\n's to end a line before it recognises the first lin end the
line before it recognises the first line.

many thanks, robert

Two things: one, fgets() is set up to always read up until either a \n is seen
or the buffer you hand it fills up; two, the FILE structure for stdin is, if
you have it hooked up to a terminal, going to by default use readln() for
input.  (Gee, I just split an infinitive! :=)  The getstat is sufficiently
system-dependent that I probably would hide the whole thing under a function
interface (that could buffer stuff for you if more than one character were
ready, for efficiency's sake) and not bother to use C standard I/O.

Your approach using the getsYour approach using the getstat call is correct.

Fgets() is the wrong way to read in one character at a time. You could either
use:

   a) read() - low level, raw I/O

   b) getc(fp) - high level.

When using buffered (high level) I/O, and you want character granularity, you
may want to unbuffer standard input like this:

   setbuf(stdin, NULL);

Robert,
 Here's a quick-and-dirty routine to get one byte from a path you have
previously opened with open() (or use path = 0 for stdin).
 cread(path,buf)
 int path;
 char *buf;
 {
      int cnt;
 
      if((cnt = _gs_rdy(path)) < 0)
           return(cnt);
      if(cnt == 0)
           return(cnt);
      return(read(path,buf,1);
 }
 
 This should read just one byte. If there is nothing there, it returns 0.
Obviously if there is an error, it returns -1. Hope this is a good starting
place for you.

file mys
   file myself. 2. I can find mknod() or makdir() on OS9, but how do I remove a

I get the current directory?

I have look through the microware language manual a couple times and it is

(system is going down in 5 mins, so I have to be quick):

A) Use the password related functions available in the Kreider libraries. We
all use them instead of the MW libraries. See LIB 3.

b) Sorry - no easy way... Wait.. did you try 'unlink()'? Dunno if it works on a
directory (never tried it).. worst case you could "system("deldir {dirname})"

 Just to let you all know, I received my BASIC09 disk last night from Tandy,
you know, the one that I couldn't load for some reason. It worked great. Now I
don't have to keep worrying that my disk drive couldnt do the job. I'm looking
forward to learning all about BASIC09 and OS9. I finally was able to use CONFIG
and add a printer to my list of devices so I can use Color Artist by Steve
Bjork. Bless you all. Thanks.

 I bought Color Artist, a program by Steve Bjork. I'm enjoying using it. It's
the kind of program my kids go nuts over. Now that I have my CONFIG disk that
works, I can use Color Artist with my DMP-100 printer. However, I am having a
problem with it that I hope someone here can help me with.
 The DMP-100 is switchable between 600 and 1200 baud. I used "xmode /p baud=3"
to set the baud rate to 1200 before running Color Artist. This worked great.
 I used Color Artist to just draw a simple line, to test the printer. Here is
what my line looked like:
  ****
      ****
          ****
              **** (get the idea?)

 Here is how it printed:
  ****
      **

        **
          ****

               ****

 It seemed to be doing to line feeds between each printing. Any ideas?

Crownover. Tell him I sent you. If you need help porting to OS9, drop me e-mail

Hi. I want to ask you something about obtaining filename information. I was
wondering how to get that without scanning the whole directory. Let's say I
need some information on a file called 'TESTFILE.EXT'. Do I open that file as
READ+DIR? or just READ? Do I set the data TYPE as
 TYPE file=name$:STRING[29];lsn0,lsn1,lsn2:BYTE and then go to the sector with
the information that I need with another type
 TYPE
sector=att:BYTE;own:INTEGER;y,m,d,mi,link:BYTE;sz1,sz2,sz3,sz4:BYTE;yr,mo,da:BYTE;seg:STRING[240]?
I need to get info on a file quickly without scanning the whole directory. The
way I have this program that I'm working on set up is
 it reads a directory until it finds the filename that its looking for, opens
another path as "/dd@", gets the info from that and prints the results.
However; it takes a little longer than I want it to. I'd like to just be able
to open the file and get the info that way if I could without using SysCall..
Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

You have two options:

a) Do as you're doing.... open the directory, scan until you find the name,
then use the 3 byte LSN to get the file's FD sector number, then go  get that
on /DD@ and dissect it - or -

b) Open the file, use the getstat SS.FD which will snag the file's FD sector
into a buffer you allocate.

The a) approach is actually quicker, since it's being done under the sheets
anyway in approach b)

Thanks for the help. I was using a) and it took about 3 seconds to find the
filename and give the info on it. Does the other way use SysCall? I've got an
idea on how to cut down on search time....I'll play with that for awhile.
Thanks again...

One possibility is to read the whole directory into RAM in one shot. You could
use _gs_size to determine how big it is, and you could even dynamically
allocate the storage for it (if using C) using a malloc(). If using B09, you
may need to set aside a certain reasonable maximum sized buffer. Reading in one
fell swoop is much quicker than several 32 byte reads.

Then, you could do the lookup in RAM, which would be much faster. 3 seconds
sounds pretty slow.

You can use the dEd disk editor (DL9 or 10), Patch, or any number of other
utilities to patch a boot file. If running a coco/2/3, dEd is probably your
best bet, and the price is right.

No, but I bet that since the range is probably the same, that one might be able
to get away with chucking the least significant byte and stuffing it in a C
float on the 6809.  Give that a shot; even if it doesn't work, it's easy to
try! :-)

The main problem is that the sign bit is on opposite sides of the mantissa! I
think it may have to be done by an assembler subroutine.

I am not using BASIC09, I am having to interpet some files written with BASIC09
with C and some fields are BASIC09 REAL datatype which is funcky compared to
C's double. Fortunatly, Greg Law reminded me that the Microware C manual has

fine.

Pete,

I downloaded dEd.ar as you suggested. I thought the OS9 manual was bad. I don't
understand a thing in the docs. I know NOTHING about byte offsets in a module
or anything else mentioned in that.

Could you briefly describe HOW I could change the bootfile modules as I
requested?

For example - change D0_35S to D0_40D  or  change TERM_VDG to TERM_WIN as well
as adding a module to a bootfile.

Without some explanation, that program is useless to me. Sorry for my
ignorance.

Well, one cheap and easy method is to use CMP to compare the two modules like
this:

  CMP <current module>  <desired module>

This will give you a list of the offsets and values of bytes that are
different.

The second (and more valuable) approach is to invest some time with the OS9
Technical Reference Manual in the section on RBF Device Descriptors. It'll pay
dividends later.

Kevin,

Something to think about for the GUI is moving around directory trees. With
GShell, it's a royal pain (even with a hard disk) to move around the directory
tree. It would be nice to have a quick way of doing so. Perhaps by displaying a
tree off to the side and allowing the user to click on a directory name?

parameters, but tmode doesn't?
