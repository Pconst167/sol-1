Hey, T Bob!

I think you meant Bitnet for those files from Frank. Being out of town as much
as you are, you'd probably better not sign up (it comes in thru CIS Mail, so
you'd need to read it every day, almost).

No idea about Y-Modem vs CIS B. Probably close to same speed, I'd guess.
Someone will correct me if not <grin>.

I am also following Frank's lead and advise and probably will get a Seagate 42

Frank downloaded the whole thing from BitNet and it looked downright

Gimix, OS-9 and heading to the West SanFernando Valley. I thought that maybe
there was a store that sold Gimix or other OS9 systems in the area. So I

Tony,

I was the one who wrote the obscure reference to the far west end of the San
Fernando Valley. By far west end I was referring to Newbury Park - where Pete
lives.

Admittedly, that's stretching the Valley a wee bit to the west. And I should
know better! I'm a columnist at the Daily News in
... ah ... Woodland something (grin). But, I don't live in the Valley. I do all
my writing via the modem. (I know. I know. What a poor excuse!)

By making a pilgrimage to the far west end I was referring to a proposed visit
to Pete's home - one time abode of the now departed GIMIX Ghost. My computer
wouldn't read a single density disk. His GIMIX could. And did.

I hope that clears up any confusion. And, yes, I am crazy! (grin)

I've talked to him a few times about making the journey to see his Gimix

school and such. Interesting idea journalism via modem ! What do you write
(type) about ? Are you still running a Gimix system ? The closest thing I 'v
ever come to seeing a Gimix wuz on the back cover of Color Computer News
(REMEMBER THAT ONE COCO VETERANS !!!!!!!!). You and Pete may not have heard of
that magazine if you are strictly Gimix users, but it was another of the
thousands (just kidding Lonnie !) of Color Ccomputer magazines to come and go
since day 1, and yes I do beleive Rainbow is on it's way out too. Staples this
month !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So if I don't get to see Pete's Gimix system maybe I
could convince you to give me a tour if you have the time. Thanx.

Ssorry. I din't know that. Anyway, it wasn't intended as an insult. I just
thought since I usually hear you talking about Gimix systems, that it was your
first system. I still have a gray dinosaur myself, but my Rainbows don't go
back as far as yours. Guess you been round longer. Ok you win. Maybe not. I
forgot, I have Thunder Ram on my CC 1. It was a 256K ram board that allowed you
to have 4 separate 64k basic banks running. But only 1 bank would actually be
running a program at a time. The other 3 would just sit there waiting to be
mapped in . Wwhat a neat idea WAY back then, but the true applications for that
were somewhat limited ( actually it wuz just our imaginations that were
limited). Thanks to Chris Erving, Thunder Ram wuz made possible. I wonder what
happedened to him. I used to see him at the Color Aamerica meetings, but then
he defected to the Amiga crowd. I guess he was entitled to it. He helped
stretch the coco 1's capabilities several times. Aanybody know where Chris is
or what he is doing ????? TC

FTP is indeed File Transfer Protocol.  It is part of "TCP/IP", the network
protocol used on the old ARPANet and now on the InterNet.  Many nodes on the
network have libraries of files (programs, data, etc.) which are publicly
available.  Rather than give accounts to everyone who wants to get this or that
file, these nodes have set up a "guest" account called "anonymous". People can
then login with FTP as anonymous to fetch the files the want.

In the event nobody's given you a solution for  packaging and compressing
groups of files with subdirectories, the best bet is:

  1) use 'tar' to create a tar file of the files/dirs

  2) compress it using 'compress'

So, if you wanted to package and send all the files in /dd/TOP as one unit,
you'd do something like this:

  chd /dd/TOP
  tar cvf /dd/tmp/topstuff.tar .

That would make a unix compatible TAR file called topstuff.tar in the directory
/dd/tmp (the TAR arguments 'cvf' tell it to 'c'reate a new tar file,
'v'erbosely show all the files being stuffed into it, and to use 'f'ile
/dd/tmp/topstuff.tar as the repository.) To break it out, you'd do the inverse:
chd [directory of your choice]; then tar xvf /dd/tmp/topstuff.tar ('x'tract).

I'd also recommend compressing the files using the compress command in DL9.
It's a unix compatible LZ compression tool that uses a 12 bit compression
scheme (i.e. if creating a file on unix for later decompression under OS9, you
should use 'compress -b12 filename' to keep unix from using a 16 biy
compression map). Anyway, under OS9 you'd just type: compress topstuff.tar.
This would create a called topstuff.tar.Z. You would upload that file.

To get it exploded back to normal, you'd just 'compress -d topstuff.tar.z', and
then use 'tar xvf topstuff.tar' to break it all back out.

Pete

P.S. I'll make sure that we have a copy of TAR in DL9 if we don't already.

The TOP package contains an OSK version of the UNIX "tar" facility.  It will
preserve the directory structure.  You might want to consider uploading "tar"
first, followed by a tar file containing docs.  A person downloading could then
get tar and whatever tar files and extract the files needed.

FYI: The TOP tar files are compatible with UNIX tar.  The FTP-able copy of the
TOP stuff is one 10 Meg. tar file.  I was able to extract the OSK tar from that
file and then transfer it and the tar file to my ST for further extraction...

Hi Dwight!

Following your advice (see my message to Pete Lyall).

How long ago did you download?  And, is there source code for mmon, password
and the rest of the login package?

The transfer time for kermit is not surprizing - it's not too swift but it is
reliable.  I'm using Sterm and B+ protocol to upload.  Much faster.

I downloaded TOP about two weeks ago.

Scanning through the list of files, I don't see sources for mmon, password or
login.

Yeah, I know kermit is slow, especially the "small block" kermit that I had
handy.  On the other hand it works well and was already on my Sun at work.  All
I did was cart my Atari to work, hook it up to the Sun and let it run over
night.

Top certainly has enough goodies to be well worth the download time.  I'm
really happy with the version of the Bourne Shell (sh) that they provide.  It
allows you to write shell scripts, has command recall with editting, etc.  Very
nice! They also provide two of my favourite UNIX utilities, sed and awk.

Are you looking for a used terminal?

Try "The Electronics Exchange" on St. Charles Rock Road about a half mile west
of I-170.  They're on the left side of the road (while going west) next to
Floyd's Tire and hard to see.

Last time I was in there they had some Televideo 925s, DEC VT-52s, Freedom
100s, and some other oddball stuff.  In the back room (back left corner as
viewed from the front door) buried on the bottom of a shelf they had a bunch of
recent Wyse (?) and Esprit terminals but I didn't see any keyboards for them,
doesn't hurt to ask though.

They've got some real garbage in there but sometimes you can find something
useful, I bought an all but new Televideo 955 for $85.00 for the company I work
for.  Stock varies a lot from month to month sometimes.

Good luck!

  Check the file PCDOS.AR in LIB 10. It runs under OS9, and will do the job for

Take your choice.

Yes, my initial intention was to make all the StG modules interact with the
original stuff so that you could use either login or tsmon for instance - but
I've had to drop that idea somewhat.  You can use the old tsmon or the old
login, but you loose net transfer capabilities.  But the new modules act the
same and use the same format password file etc, for the most part.

How about this - you can help me with the V4 development.  Although I
personally am against having utilities such as SU laying around (one can just
log into sysop no?), I haven't yet written a chown.  We couldl work out a swap
of a set of my library utilities and full package for some additional routines
to be added to it.  I have already completed the majority of the library
routines, including the new password file read routines.  It does not as yet
have the key index stuff in it yet, but programs written to use these calls
will work when recompiled with the change in password routines.

It would be nice to have a chown (as well as other utilities) that are
integrated into the package.

Call me at (317) 241-6401 to discuss it further.

Yes, I do want to test the uucp port.  I have multiple machines, and can run a
test on a different one.  I can also interface my mailer to any format.

I want to get the source code for the protocol so that I can rig it to function
from within the StG login package.  This would allow my StG nodes in the
netherlands and australia to hook into a local uucp node instead of calling
major long distance.  It would also help for within the country too.

The StG login package is a commercial package (barely).  But whatever small
modifications/additions to the UUCP software will be placed in the PD.  I have
no interest in selling UUCP, only allowing people who are using StG to hook
into UUCP.

I may not even need the actual G protocol source - all that I am interested in
is the bare routines necessary to implement a transfer.  In essence, something
I can pipe a pre-formatted list of messages into, run to do the transfer (I can
write my own handler for calling in), and which outputs a list of messages to
be posted.  I can take it from there.  Depending on how modularized your set of
modules is, I may not even need any source at all.  But it would be silly to
sit down and write my own G driver.

If you wish, I would even relinquish docs and libraries on interfacing to my
package and you or someone else can do the interface and post it pd.  But as I
wrote the stupid thing, I could handle it much faster.

My intentions in obtaining your UUCP driver are simply to enhance an already
existing network of OS9 people across the country (and world).  I have no want
to make money from this, or even to steal your coding and use for my own
purposes.  All I want is to improve communications between OS9 people by
hooking together networks.  Surely you can understand that.

Let me know what I must to do convince you.

Scott,

If you write out the work files in the format that uucico expects them, you
might not have to write any code at all.  You need to transfer several files at
once? Pretty simple, just write out the list in the right format, giving the
file a name that uucico will recognize and it will go on its own.

You don't need to convince me, just that I'm always a little leary when someone
asks for the source code and mentions porting to his/her special environment. 
Not that I didn't "steal" lots of my routines from Steve Sampson who did a port
of uucp for UniFlex.  Don't know how he got it to work right tho....I had to
work it over pretty good.

Anyway, I'll send you the source code along with the rest of the uucp files.
I'd appreciate it if you would let me see what you do with it.

Hey, thanks!  It will take me a bit to get to it (spending the next two weeks

interfacing necessary.  You want a free copy of the StG sw?  You might want to

Yeah, we have a "kit" -- the populated board with software. You have to get
your own case and PS and HD floppy. Cost is $659 -- a good deal if you already
have your own case, PS, and HD floppy!

Hard drives require the second board, but the second board gets you NOT ONLY
the hard disk host adapter, but a ton o' stuff, including stereo sampling/
playback ports, mice ports, parallel ports, serial port, etc. Think of the
second board as stereo music/voice synthesizer expandable to 9 meg -and just
incidentally a hard disk interface that allows you up to seven SCSI devices.

You CAN use the B & B if you 1) backup your B & B 2) get a SCSI controller card
(cheap at $80) 3) reformat the drive 4) put your stuff back on the drive. How
you put the drive in the case depends on a few things -- give me a call.

Paul, how come you have to reformat the hard drive when converting from B&B to
SCSI?  Is that 'cuz MSDOS does it differently than OSK?

Say, your kit is just over $100 less than the ready-to-rock-it. I think I'll
just get my case, PS, and floppy from you. (P.S.: Our OS9 Club meets tomorrow

Interjecting reply for Paul:

It's necessary to reformat the hard drive because B&B uses the 512 byte sector
format since it's a PC controller, whereas it is more common to use the 256
byte sector format with OS9, because SCSI does support it.  If the driver is
written to handle it, it is possible to set up SCSI to use a 512 byte format
under OS9 using the same 2 sectors in every 1 on disk format that the B&B does.

However, I personally would suggest against trying to convert a B&B drive to
use on the MM1.  It requires you obtain a SCSI controller, and steal the hard
drive from your CoCo.  Imbedded SCSI drives (that is, with a controller built
into the drive) are much faster and more reliable.  And, they're not all that
expensive anymore, as they are fast becoming the preferred type of drive (even
amoung PC'ers) because of their speed, reliablity, and large sizes.  My
recommendation to people is to leave your CoCo intact and invest in a better
drive for the new machine...

The SCSI hard disk on my MM/1 prototype uses 512-byte sectors... no tricks
needed these days as RBF handles whatever size you specify. Does mean that
software relying on 256-byte sectors (dEd for one) doesn't work, tho.

Kevin, Just read your note about dEd and SCSI and 512 byte sectors. I was under
the impression that despite using 512 byte sectors at the hardware level, the
logical sectors were still 256 bytes. Here is the dmode of the SCSI drive I'm
using now:

DD ctrlrid=1 lun=0 cyls=2510 hds=7 sectrk=36 sectrk0=36 alloc=64 ilv=1 step=7
park=2510 secsize=512 trys=7

dEd has no problem with this. I'm using OSK 2.2. Did 2.3 change some of this?

Doug, I haven't kept up that well, but I was under the impression that I'm
using a variable-size RBF which doesn't break up the LSNs into 256-byte
sectors.

That's what I was told by a friend, after I tried using dEd on my 512-byte
sector HD (on MM/1)... it kinda worked, kinda didn't... and almost lost LSN 0
it seemed. Maybe not. I'm afraid to experiment any more <grin>.

Hmm... if you read/write 256 bytes at a time, why shouldn't it work? Seems like
it oughta, no matter what the sector size is. Strange. I shall ask. - kev

I can understand you being leery after LSN 0 problems. I have had it
overwritten 3 times when somehow a file descriptor got partially zeroed out so
it pointed to LSN 0 as the first file sector. That was the impetus behind
re-writing dEd. Let me know if you find anything else out. I had some problems
with the version a sent you earlier, but nothing like overwriting disks.

Mike - different controllers put data on disk in different ways. There's no
standard, because after all you can't move the hard disk platters.

So it's because the controllers are different that you'd have to reformat.
Kinda like VHS vs Beta tapes... both record, but in different internal formats.

Amiga/bridgecard drive? Y'all are discussing using SCSI drives with the MM/1,
so I assume it's possible? Any advice on how I could get a SCSI drive to work

DoM Eet,

You can use either 3.5 or 5.25 PC-style floppy drives, normal or hi-density. Up
to four of them, I believe. It comes with one 3.5 hidens drive (useable in
normal density mode also, of course).

Switching those between two computers would involve the "usual" stuff... like a
17-pole switch or so. Accessing MSDOS disks will be possible, so you could
manually move the disk from one drive to another, too.

SCSI should be easier. I could see sharing a HD between the machines... altho
that would mean partitioning it into PC/OS9 sections to prevent trouble. Hmm.
There is a PCDOS file manager for OS9, but I cringe at the thought of using it
for normal OS9 HD operations.

So personally I'd put two HDs on there: one for the Bridgeboard side, the other
for the OS9 side. If you have the second (I/O expansion) board on the MM/1,
it's just a matter of using a 50-pin cable to hook a SCSI drive to the
computer's SCSI header. Any size HD is fine. I know of people with two
1-gigabyte drives online. Did I answer what you meant? best - kev

PS: a friend noticed that a place called the Treasure Chest (?) in Computer
Shopper had 85meg SCSI hard disks for about $370! Sounds like a deal!

Perhaps.  What I see if I start up kermit after UUCP has given up is the same
as I would see if I had the port set to 8-n-0.  I can tell this as the login
banner on the UNIX machine I'm calling gives the same set of "cracker"
characters. They look like they have the 8th bit set.  Running "uucico -x9"
gives me the impression that uucico is reading the first character which has
the 8th bit set and giving up.

John, I'm very interested in your comment about a SCULPTOR tutorial.  I think
I'm very much with SCULPTOR like I was in the early years of OS9, I have the
package and I use only about 10% of its capabilities.  One problem I've been
trying to work out is multiple to one relationships between data files.  For
example, I call on several offices in the Northeast, each one having its own
information which I might need to recall.  No problem there. However, each
office might be working on several different projects and when I access the
data on the projects I need to be able to reference the information from the
office data.  To further complicate things, I might need information from the
files of an individual from that office, again one of many individuals at each
office.  The point of all this rambling is simple:  Need a beta tester for your
tutorial?  <hint, hint>.

Sorry....no clue.  All I know is if you play around with the termcap entry it
either works or it crashes.  I'm really disapointed in it.  Are you giving the
port name when you run Sterm?  Currently, Sterm defaults to port t2 unless you
give it another name on the command line like:

    sterm -f /t3

You think that might be it?

Here's the problem: When I run Sterm (command line: Sterm -f /t9) the standard
input path appears to shut down. Nothing from the keyboard makes it to the
program. However, if I switch to a second virtual terminal window and send the
appropriate Hayes code to the output port (t9), the modem will print out its
menu to the Sterm screen (when I switch back to the virtual terminal that's
running Sterm). In other words, Sterm will not take anything from the keyboard.
But, it will print what comes to it from the T9 port. I've tried to get the
terminal to unlock the keyboard and just about anything else that sounds
vaguely similar, but no-go. And changing Termcap doesn't do anything.

This is a strange one.

I think you're right. From my very limited view (grin) the serial port driver
looks like it will send a signal to wake up the process, but won't do anything
with the keyboard. That's probably why earlier versions of Sterm (and Xcom9)
work while the latest Sterm won't. The new Sterm polls the keyboard
differently. Right?

Of course, you must realize that I don't have the slightest idea what I'm
talking about.

I think Pete hit on the problem for you.  However, I'm not sure as to why since

By older version of Sterm, I was referring to a really OLD version (9232

won't work has 31561 bytes and is labeled The OS-9 User's Group Universal

I'm sure you've had multiple responses at this point, but I see a couple of
things:

  a) There's a semicolon after your test condition, which in effect
     causes a 'null' statement (i.e. while(c == 'd'), do nothing -
     including not getting any other characters, so the results
     of the test never change.

  b) What is c initially? If it's a typical automatic variable,
     it could contain anything - no promises here unless it's
     a static variable. You could either shift the position
     of the getchar(), and alter the logic, or you could stuff
     a NULL or something into c so you know your starting point.

Bruce, thanks for message 4581. I've been trying to figure out why getchar()
wouldn't let my program continue until it got a <CR>. Being a beginner, I
didn't realize it was so dependent on the buffer.

But when I tried read(fileno(stdin),&c,1) it *still* waited for a <CR>
before it would recieve a character. Do I have to go to an even lower level
keyboard scan or something to get it to respond to a single keypress?

You've got me Tom.  It doesn't work like that on my system--a COCO III, LVL II
with the Microware C compiler.  Not knowing exactly what you've coded, compile
and run the following program.  It should return the ascii value of a key
immediately after it is pressed.

 #include <stdio.h>

 main()
 {
      char c;

      do
      {
           read(fileno(stdin),&c,1);
           printf(" Key = %x/n",(int)c);
      }while(c!='/n');
 }

(the slashes above in /n should be backslashes--the terminal program I'm using
doesn't have them)

Just so you know, your program still waits for a whole line on my sytem.
[IBM XT, DOS 3.3, tried both QuickC and MS Codelink 4.00]

    It does nothing until I have typed in an entire line, then executes as
if I just typed it. It works fine, just too late.


    Do you - or anyone else reading - know how I can get around my buffer,
or read from it when it hasn't got a complete line? (And since I've only
programmed in C for two weeks, remember I might not know stuff that's
obvious to everyone else)

[butting in..]

Are you using low level (read()) or high level (fread(), gets(), getchar(),
etc.)?

If high level, try setting buffering off, i.e.

  setbuf(stdin,0);

Also - in MSDOS land, they distinguish between text a binary file types (at
least when reading/writing the files)... Try setting your file type variable to
O_BINARY (check your docs)...

Denise,
   Go ahead and download under RS-DOS, but before you do have DOSOR9 handy and
a freshly formatted OS9 diskette.
   Go to LIB 10 and download RSDOS.AR, -AND- to LIB 9 and download AR09.BIN.
   DOSOR9 BOTH files over to your formatted OS9 disk.
   Now...let's take care of the de-archving file first. You will need to reset
the appropriate attributes to get the thing to fly, so, in ALL following
examples, replace the "/d?" with the drive you are using. You will need to type
the following, to change the attributes:
   ATTR /d?/AR09.BIN PE PW PR E W R
   Next, rename the file to get rid of the .BIN extension, type:
   RENAME /d?/AR09.BIN AR
   Bingo, part one is done. So next, we have to change the attributes to
RSDOS.AR so we can do things with it, type the following:
   ATTR /d?/RSDOS.AR PW PR W R
   Bingo, part two is done....and now to extract the files, you can do this by
typing the following:
   /d?/AR -x /d?/RSDOS.AR       and it should extract the files.
   Keep in mind, if you get any errors, it's likely because OS9 doesn't know
where the programs (like ATTR, RENAME, or AR) are located, so don't be afraid
to give full path descriptors (ie... /d0/cmds/ATTR /d0/RSDOS.AR) to where ever
the programs AND files you need to changes or extract are located.
   Good luck!

  Yes it is possible, although your uploading may go faster than CIS sends it
back to you. Your script should look like this (and keep in mind, I am going
one char over in this example, because the slashes would actually do this if it
were flush left...grin).

At the Forum prompt:

 L   <---stands for Leave (a message)
 {this is the body of your message.}
 /ex <---flush left...as you know this exits the editor
 POST;{TO UID};{SUBJECT};{SUBTOPIC AREA}

 The {TO UID} is who the message is to: ie..Dan Robins 73007,2473
 The {SUBJECT} is what it is about: ie.. Leaving A Message
 The {SUBTOPIC AREA} is the section you want: ie.. 10

 Here's a short example...and remember, everything would be flush left, if I
were doing this for real:

 L
 Leaving a message for Dan Robins to show how and uploaded ASCII text file
 could take care of leaving a message for me.
 /ex
 POST;Dan Robins 73007,2473;An Automessage;10


 Now..there is a way to upload messages here, but, I have found out from
experience, that when I had more than one, this was the quickest way to get the
job done for me. Mind you though, it will all look garbled because CIS falls
way behind in echoing the info back to you.

Al;

  The next revision to VIEW incorporates <L>eaving messages (starting a new
thread) as well as storing all replies in one file for transmission to CIS.

  I'm still having some minor problems with getting the 'editor' function to go
back and correct a previous line, but should be done sometime RSN.

  Are you still getting stray chars before the "#:" ?  I've tried several
different methods of determining message start, and so far, haven't come up
with anything more reliable than the present method.

  In addition to Dan's reply, you might check out a file called FAST.CIS

The problem you are having is a very common in the game.  It crept up after I
uploaded the game.  It is a memory problem as a result of recursive
programming. To correct it, boot the game this way: OS9: load depthsmod <ENT>
OS9: dungeon #24k <ENT>

That'll take care of it for you.

Sounds like you may be missing a header file, or somehow not hitting a typedef

I think JJ may have nailed part of it... the u_char may not be defined. Try
inserting a line to the effect of:

   typedef u_char unsigned char;

near the top of the code (before main()).

Also, the 'return on non-void function' is a new one, but I have a guess. A
function declared as a 'void' means that it 'returns' nothing. If the function
that's complaining obviously returns something, try declaring that function  as
returning that type, also up in the beginning of the code, i.e.:

   int foo();

or

  char * woof();

Depending on the type being returned.

It does sound as though these should have been addressed in a .h file.

The 2.3 c compiler now checks this (ansi, here we come!) - that a function
declared int (the default) has to return something - an int. Many PD programs
have this "bug". I always note files with the return warning in them and
globally replace "return;" with "return(0);" just to get rid of the pesky
warnings. They *are* only warnings, BTW. It is very rare that anyone delcares a
function as type void. (I didn't say never, did I? <g>).

That warning tells you that you have a function that is supposed to return
something, but it contains a plain old "return;" statement.  This typically
shows up in code written in the days before the "void" type.

        I finally worked it out with the read(0,&ch,1) combined with a

other that 'q'.

strcmp() requires string pointers for both paramters. You are using a char
value for the second parameter. &ch won't work either cuz that's a pointer to
type char, not string. Try using strchr("q",ch)  or if you don't have the
Krieder lib use index("q",ch).

It doesn't return a FALSE, per se. It returns a difference of 0. If the
characters mismatch at some point, it'll return a positive if the difference
was positive, and the same for negative.

For clarity, some people like to declare a MACRO to take care of the logic:

 #define STREQ(x,y) (strcmp(x,y) == 0)

This way, you could use:

    if STREQ(onestring, theotherstring)
      blah_blah(blah);

Whoa! Wrongo!

read(0,&ch,1);   - puts char in (char) ch

BUT!!!

strcmp("q",ch);

is TOTALLY wrong.  1) assuming ch is declared 'char ch;' you have only one byte
allocated.  Strings are multiple bytes... AND strcmp expects a pointer to
string.  A char is not going to work!

strcmp("q",&ch);

would be closer, but still wrong.  You must have a zero terminator to both
strings, and you have no idea what follows the char ch in memory!

There are two alternatives:

char ch[2]; ch[1]=0; read(0,ch,1); strcmp("q",ch);

OR

char ch; read(0,&ch,1); if (ch=='q') ...;

Of course the latter makes more sense.

Be careful.  Two things: (1) strcmp expects to be handed *pointers* to
characters, and those pointers had better point to NUL-terminated strings, so
that even if you changed that to strcmp("q", &ch), it might not do what you
want. (2) strcmp() is documented to return a negative number if the first
string is less than the second, zero if the first string is equal to the
second, and a positive number if the first string is greater than the second. 
It always pays to read the documentation.

I am a software engineer with a company in Halifax, Nova Scotia (up in Canada
for those of you who should know better, but don't) that is involved in the
development of a VMEbus based image and digital signal processing system. 
Unlike most DSP applications, this is commercial and not military, and can be
discussed in an open forum.

We are currently in the design process for a real-time version of a system that
we have developed to this point in DOS.  To operate at the speed we require,
the system will employ extremely high data rates (on the order of 10Mhz), and
use a pipe-lined architecture.  We expect that the final system will have 4-6
single board computers (680x0 based CPUs), an array processor (probably CSPI's
SuperCard), and a suite of image processing boards from Datacube.

We are in the process of analyzing real-time operating systems, and are
considering OS-9 as our target environment.  I would like to solicit comments
or suggestions from anyone who has used OS-9 for real-time VMEbus based
systems. I am especially interestee suitability of OS-9 for use in a
multiprocessor environment.

Questions such as :

- Will OS-9 consume too many resources in a system where RAM and MIPS are at
  at premium?

- How does OS-9 perform in a multi-processor environment?

- Do you suggestping on the target, or is using either a DOS or UNIX
  based host the better method?

- Are the development tools adequate, both in terms of performance and ease
  of use?

- Are there many OS-9 drivers for such things as array processors and other
  external devices?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

You might wish to call Microware; they may be able to refer you to users with
similar applications.  It's interesting that you should mention Datacube; I

Hi Robb,

With luck, some of the VME developers around here will spot your message and
reply (I'm not one, altho I do a fair amount of driver writing on personal
machines). I assume you've talked to Microware already (515-224-1929) and
gotten some info from them... I'd also ask them for names of other developers
you could call for opinions and/or help. You can also stop by their CIS display
area ("go msc").

You might also talk to Mike Burgher (I believe) at Microware west coast
(408-980-0201)... I think he helped develop their DOS/Uni-Bridge environments,
and he'll give you a fair opinion on whether or not to develop on the target.
[If you have more than one prototype, many people do. Kinda keeps you in the
feel of things, and also helps you to notice any problems quicker]

OS-9 is pretty resource conservative... perhaps not quite as much from first
glance as some other systems, but then you usually have to write less extra
code to handle things OS9 already has, for example.

Never used OS9 in a multiprocessor setup, altho I've heard of machines that
did. No idea about array processor drivers.

Developers tell me the tools are quite adequate, altho perhaps not as fancy
from the viewer's standpoint (no blazing colors/borders like on DOS computers).
Function over beauty.

Oh. If you're researching and got some $$, you can stop by COMPLIB here on CIS
and search for articles/references with keywords such as "microware", "os-9",
"realtime", and "multiprocessing" to find more info on most OS's.

Robb,
 I am on the trailing edge of developing a VME-based system using OS-9. We have
a Motorola MVME147-s (68030, 8mb) in slot1 and MVME333's (68010, 512kb) in
slots 3-20, all running OS-9. It is not "multiprocessor" in the sense that I
believe you want - each slave is a special block device (we had to do a custom
file manager) to the master (eg: /slot3, /slot4, etc) and vice-versa (eg:
/host).
 I believe you will find OS-9 to be as good as any other "Real-Time" O.S.
(psos, pdos, vrtx) in terms of performance on a target, where performance
measures the drain on processor bandwidth and memory usage by the kernel and
the size and speed of final binaries generated by the compiler. You can (as we
did when porting Unix message queues to OS-9) compile to assembler source and
then tweek that as needed. During development, however, OS-9 really shines over
all the rest because you can get a shell on your target and get a lot of
debugging help.
 I cannot tell how OS-9 will behave in *your* multi-processor environment. We
are happy with ours, but, as I said, it is not what you probably mean by
mulit-processor.
 I would strongly suggest using a Unix host for development. While OS-9 has all
the basics - shell, editor, etc - I just got lots of complaints from the other
developers about missing things - a good version of "vi", the shell they were
used to (csh, ksh, sh) with scripting, slow disk i/o (making for slow compile
times), no uucp (although TOP is supposed to fix theirs), etc.
 You will most likely be writing your own drivers for custom things. Microware
was very good about getting sample code to us for ours.

L Hi Al:

I assume your reference to 'multiple to one relationships' is really how to use
cross-reference files.  In both dl2 and dl3 are some demonstration programs
some of which will show you how to use cross-reference files.  Of special
interest is the one from Brad Masters in Australia - you'll find that one in
dl3.

In reality, cross-reference files are trivial to implement in Sculptor. The
real problem is determining exactly what is wanted.  Before you start writing
code, determine what info is going to be needed for output and what input data
is available.  Then you can start playing with file structures and
relationships.  This phase usually takes lots of time (and paper and pencil). 
Done properly and thoroughly, this process often ends up almost writing the
code itself.  (NOTE - this is good programming practice no matter what language
you're using.)

I'm afraid that you can't set a path in the startup file and have it stay

If one fixes that "problem", doesn't that create incompatibility with OSK?

I don't see it as a problem so much.  There are many ways of getting around it.
For example, I have a program that goes in the .login script (does shell+ have
this?) that sets the TERM environment variable, after asking the user what he
wants.  It works because shell runs the .login before taking input from the
user.  Unfortunately, the program only works when you first log in.. if you
switch terminals, you can't run the program from the command line.  So you log
out...

Scott,

By setting a TERM environment do you mean setting writing a line in some sort
of environment file?  Sure, you can do it that way.

The problem with Shell+ is not the shell really, but OS9 itself.  Same problem
exists in UNIX also, if you want to call it a problem.  Setting a directory
path is only current as long as that shell is running.  Setting the shell's
PATH variable in the startup file works fine as long as that shell is running. 
When it goes away, so does all the parameters for that specific shell.

UNIX environment variables as well as with OSK are not the same....they stay
around.  A pity that OS9/6809 does not have the same thing.

Yes, I know.  Unix has separate global vars and local/passed vars.  My point
however was that as OSK does not have globals, adding such to OS9 Shell+ would
be a mistake (in my opinion) as it would open up incompatibilities.

stevie (bad pointers that non-memory protected systems did not notice). The
problem with stevie port *I* had was that they used their own termcap library
which did not handle fill characters properly. It worked fine with terminals
that had no fill charcters.

Ed,
 You look in the manual for the terminal in question. I have done this only
once. Your best bet is to steal a termcap entry from a Unix machine for the
terminal you want. Termcap entries that work will have the padding info in them
already and Microware's termcap library handles them automatically.
 I can visibly perceive the faster screen fill using uMacs on two of the
terminals at work (AT&T 5410 and 5425). If you don't do padding, the terminals
want to do flow control, which is not good if your editor uses ^Q and ^S!!

Allen,
     I am sending this note to give you a starting point.  Look in the July
1990 issue of OMNI magazine on page 22.  There is an article entitled "Power
Tools" that describes an eye controlled computer program called ERICA designed
by a biomedical engineer called Thomas Hutchinson at the University of West
Virginia.  It sounds very much like what you are looking for.  I also recall
reading an article about a guy here in Dayton, OH who is into working computer
interfaces for paralyzed victims.  I think he is working with Wright State
University, but am not sure.  It would take a bit of tracking for me, and
unfortunately, I will be out of town next week.  If the U. W. Va. lead doesn't
pan out, then drop me a note and I will be happy to do some snooping around
here.  Incidently, I am a M.D. working in a USAF Medical Research lab.  We do a
small amount of this sort of stuff for Air Force personnel, but do not have
anything to offer of a general nature.  Our work is usually highly specific to
the individual, and very limited in its ability to be generalized.  Also
because of leagalities that I don't pretend to understand, it is limited to AF
personnel on a case by case basis.  Hope this helps and good luck!!

 I just got back from my honeymoon and see all types of dreadful things coming
from the UG newsletter. To wit, Microware has discontinued OS9 Personell, and
the Coco has a shaky future. (The second is nothing new.) Could you let us
Coco-ers in on what the OS9 Professional is like? How does it compare with LI
&& LII ? (Specifically does it have windowing like LII ?) Thanks a lot, Rich

Rich - Congrats on your marriage!

Actually, things are looking pretty good. Microware has taken an increased
interest in seeing OS-9 used on personal computers, and we have neat hardware
upgrade paths becoming available soon.

I think MW discontinued Personal OS9 simply because buying it with Basic was
cheaper than buying Basic by itself. Marketing musta freaked out <grin>. But
the OS-9 version for the new machines includes the C compiler and Basic, which
is good news.

The windowing I'm working on right now. Started from scratch only in March, so
it's still got a ways to go; and I'm sure we'll see additions posted here as
time goes by. But I think you'll like it.

I'm sure others can give their own impressions of OSK, but in general the main
feeling is "fast" and "lots of room" <grin>. For example, I just os9gen'd a 57K
bootfile onto a floppy disk, from a hard disk modules dir and bootlist, in
under 15 seconds. A circles gfx demo which takes 30 seconds on a CoCo takes
under 5 seconds on the MM/1. Etc.

You'll feel right at home, too, with the commands... altho they have more
options. Like I use Dsave a lot with:
   dsave -er /d0/backup -d=900627

which means copy the current dir, Execute the generated commands, and Rewrite
any files with the same name, to the /d0/backup directory. And only do this on
files with dates equal or greater than June 27, 1990.

In other words... you'll be excited, I promise. kev

Thanks for the reply. I have a PT68k-2 with a 40 meg hard disc and a 3.5

2,3,5,6,7,8 connected so I also connected pins 8 and 20 but still no luck.

You mentioned using STERM or Kermit. I can't download anything to the PT68
until the modem works with it. I downloaded TUBE to a PC at work and keyed it
into thye PT68. I suggested to Fred that he include Kermit with the OS9 discs
but he wasn't interested. I had hoped to get it from the User Group but I have
had no response from them.

For a while I wondered if anyone else was trying to use OS9 with the PT68. I
have had a lot of trouble with it. Good to hear from you.

Don,

Seems to me, SAT is on an Os9 bootable disk with a version of the operating
system that is incompatable with the CoCo 3.

My first attempts would be to copy all the SAT specific files over to a Level
II disk and give that a go.

Alternately you could try booting a Level II system. Swap out the system disk
for the SAT disk and hit RESET _once_ and see if it won't boot up.

Let us know what happenss.

Help, I'm getting into a can of worms I think. I got the file "rsdos.ar"
unarced and over to a os9 disk with the attr's set. I then read the doc and it
says that I have to use the "cc3disk.ar" file to patch my cc3disk module. I
then downloaded the cc3disk.ar file and I learn that I can't use it until I use
the "IPatch" utility. Then I have to build up a new os9boot file using os9gen.
That is getting a little heavy for a "learning" os9 user. I have built up a
boot with the Config utility. It takes a long while to use that one. I know it
takes a lot less to use os9gen but I don't know what tools and files to include
when building a new boot file up with that tool. All I really want to do is
move a file from os9 to RSDOS. Is there a os9 terminal program that uses the
bit banger? If so, I could get rid of all this gar-bage of switching between
os9 and RSDOS based terminal pkg. Denise

  Well, there was at one time a terminal program (300 baud) that worked with
the bit-banger under Level 1 OS9, but it meant a special cable, etc. to go with
the terminal program, and I don't think it is even being sold anymore. I
believe you're still gonna have to go the IPatch route to get the files between
one to the other. Solly!

Thanks Dan, I just thought of a program I bought a year ago called Burke and

basic under os9 but thats what I was familar with and got me started in os9. I
used the Skitzo tool and created a split personality disk, os9 first 17 tracks
and dos the last 17. I then used the tool called Hcopy, which copies between
the split disk, and guess what, bingo its there where I wanted it to be The
only thing was I had to use standard os9, I have mine customized to use 40 trk
double sided drives and the RSB copy tools would only work with standard 35
track format. So I got out my old level 2 original disk. Thanks again for all
the help anyway, Huggs, Denise

Denise -

Basically the disk is broken up into the following areas:

  o - LSN0 (logical sector # 0)

  o - storage bitmap

  o - File descriptor sectors

  o - Directories and files

The LSN0 contains all the crucial info about the disk (heads, cylinders,
allocation strategy, etc.). It is the 1st sector on the media. It is followed
by the bitmap. The bitmap is a series of sectors full of bytes that represent
what part of the disk is used, and what part is free. Typically, a bit in the
bitmap = 1 sector on the disk (although clustersize may be set to be greater
than 1 sector, and then each bit represents 1 cluster). The size of the bitmap
is recorded in the LSN0 sector. The File descriptor sectors are the map for
each file or directory. They contain information on date of creation, owner,
size, attributes, etc. in the 1st 16 bytes. The other 240 bytes of the sector
are 48 5-byte records of the form:

   LSN(3) #ofSectors(2)

Indicating where the file is mapped on the disk. The 1st 3 bytes show the
starting logical sector number of the chunk, and the next two show how many
sectors are in that chunk. The FD sector for the root directory is specified by
LSN # in the LSN0 sector. From there, you can find the root directory, and all
files and directories below it. All directory entries are of the form:

  Name(29) LSN(3)

Where name is up to 29 bytes long (last character has the high bit set), and
then 3 bytes tat indicate the LSN of the FD sector for that file.

You can get more information by reading about the RBF manager in the technical
reference manual. Hope that was enough to get you started.

The best place to look is in the OS-9 Technical Manual, in the section on RBF. 
That shows the layout of directories, and the contents of file descriptor
sectors and LSN 0, which is what you need to know to unravel a scrambled disk.

Bob,

I downloaded your speeded-up version of the Users' Group spelling program and
noted significant improvement with the Dict lookup program - often 600 percent
faster than the original program. However, I haven't found any improvement with
the Spell program. In fact, the new Spell occasionally runs significantly
slower than the older version, especially when the text in question has words
that appear in the Auxdict file. Is this to be expected? Am I doing something
wrong?

I'm not sure what you are doing, but I suspect that something IS wrong. Neither
the new or old version uses an "Auxdict file". Are you confusing this with
another program (maybe T/S Spell?). Or do I have an old version which I spent
all my time rewriting?

Bob,

I checked my copy of Spell - it contains 10,185 bytes and uses three files in
the /DD/MISC directory: dictionary, dict.index and auxdict (the same dictionary
and dict.index files I use with your Dict lookup program - I linked them to the
/DD/SYS/SPELL directory).

When Spell reads a file it first prints out: Reading file, Checking common
dictionary (then gives the number of matches), Checking user's dictionary
(number of matches), Checking master dictionary (and a final number of
matches).

Your version of the Dict program was SO much faster than the original (6 times
as fast) I wondered why the Spell program was not equally accelerated.

What you're describing is a SEQUENCER program. Lester Hands has one called CM3
that's about all there is for the coco market. Sequencing is tough to do in
multitasking systems because the music must be acurately timestamped as to when
notes arrive, and must correspondingly be played back without undue delay.

Anyway, talk to Lester.

Pete & Everett -- I am working (on the side) on a MIDI recording program under

Well, each received event should have the time of its reception included. An
event may be 1 to 3 bytes, tho it may not be the driver's job to parse that
out.  There are various ways to cut down on the extra data of time stamps --
like using only the low 8 bits, and throwing in special byte whenever the time
carries over.

For play, you should be able to give a timestamp followed by a whole bunch of
MIDI data bytes; when the actual time becomes equal to that timestamp, all
those bytes get blasted out as fast as possible.  THis allows buffering and
lets the play program get ahead of the job, so as to have a reserve of real
time to fall back on when things get tuff.

There are some pretty simple ways to do things in both directions. I think the
driver per se should do it simply, with more efficient encodings handled by the
application.  I'll have to think about this some more. Keep bugging me.  Best
to handle this via my Bitnet address. Thanks for asking, mike k

Kev, want to add that time resolution of 10 ms (or 1/100 sec) is probably good
enough.  5 ms or even less might be better, but I hear 10 ms is waht best suits
the MM/1. Umuise3 on the Coco3 gets by on 16.7 ms, but sxome folks can notice
it, or so they say.  Actually it's when recording hand play that you want the
most resolution -- playback you can fudge a lot better.  --mike k

Maximum data rate is 31200 bps, or 3120 bytes/sec. That equates to a resolution
at highest density of .00032 sec (320 usec). Assuming a note on/off event is
your prime concern, they typically float around in 3 byte packages [note on &
ch # | note # | velocity], that would add up to just under 1 millisecond. Also,
if several note-on's were sent as a stream, a 'running status' in the MIDI spec
allows for only one NOTE-ON/CH# byte, followed by any number of two byte tuples
of NOTE#|VELOCITY. Theoretical worst case for resolution on the timer there
would be 640 usec or so.

  Give me some ideas for demo's or whatever would show off the power and ease

  If any of you will be in or around Dayton, Ohio on either of those dates,

these would make the other "types" sit up and notice at least in this area.

Help!  Has anyone seen the following symptoms before?

My CoCo was chugging along nicely.  I decided to interrupt the B&B repack (it
hasn't made it quite halfway through my 30 Mbyte drive yet in about 18 hours of
runtime) and dial up a few places.  The repack stopped in reasonable order
(well...it does have this habit of leaving "." entries in some directories
wrong, but I can fix that with ded), and I was in fact about to fire up ded
when I found that what I was typing was being ignored.  I powered down, pulled
the CoCo out, opened it up and pulled and reseated the plastic ribbon connector
from the keyboard to the circuit board, and just hooked it up to the monitor
again to try it out.  Hot dog, it worked.

Plug everything back in again and power up.  It doesn't work.

Experimentation shows that the killer is not the printer connection, as I
suspected (after all, that's the other half of the PIA, right?), but the
high-res mouse adapter.  If I leave it unplugged, all looks well.  If I plug it
in, I can't type at my CoCo.

Any ideas?  I really would like to use my mouse.  (I guess for completeness's
sake I should try the mouse without the adapter.)

~ Frank,

I don't think Paul would contract out on you (snicker) After all you two are
taking different approaches on the new machines and each has its advantages and
disadvantages. What one person would see as not practical on one machine the
other fills the bill (IE: yours allows users to continue to use all there
current CoCo hardware and later decide to upgrade) where the MM/1 replaces most
of it (but some expensive parts are preserved thank god!) Some won't want to
move to OSK or OS9 so yours allows RSDOS compatability since it is a CoCo3 that
is souped up and fixed the brain-damaged parts (like reul serial ports and not
a bitbanger and a real keyboard w/o expensive adaptors) but the MM/1 is a more
one-piece system with more standard hardware for those who will take the jump
sooner... so in a sense your nrt fighting each other. with TWO new machines it
will sastify a wider variety of users and benefit us ALL in the end.

Do you see my point?

Ok well I was just expressing my opinion about basic09. if anyone wants to see
my BBS which currently runs on a CoCo3 using basic09 try mine at 717-586-2771
300-2400 baud 8/N/1 24hrs. this BBS will be ported to the MM/1

If one knows how to program in basic09 then the BBS can be done. those who say
Basic09 is no good for a BBS simply doesn't know how to use basic09 to the
fullest potential (like I don't know much about C right now but I am working on
it)

Mike,
   You are absolutely right!  I have written a BBS in Basic09 and it currently
stands at about 150k in I-code.  All the drivers and everything was written in
Basic09.  C is nice for short things so you don't have to have RunB tagging
along, but when it comes to the big stuff, I'll take Basic09 any day!

Sorry, I take the opposite view -- Basic09 is great for quick throwaway
programs, but for big, serious efforts, you need C. My feelings stem from the
lack of global variables and macros and constatns in B09, its fascist type
checking, and the deep breaths you take whenever daring to use any object-code
routines (tho I've learned to beat that by LOADing gfx2, inkey, etc.).

Oh yes, no pointers in B09 either.  Even Pascal (blechh) has those. Of course
this is all my personal opinions, grin.  --mike k

Aha! But basic09 programs are quicker to debug, and won't blow down the house
like C programs can <grin>. And basic09 doesn't type check when passing vars...
you can pass a 32-char string to a routine expecting a 4x8 byte array and it'll
work fine. Pointers you could fudge, but not prettily.

Then again, I can read basic programs easier ;-). Each to their own. hehe -kd

'blow down the house'? Are BASIC programs of equivalent 'power' to C programs
easier to debug? I don't think so, unless you're a _good_ BASIC programmer and
comment the h*ll out of your code. I've seen some nightmarish code in BASIC on
the C64... looked like I would imagine an APL program would look like <grin>

Yeah, well, C64 programs were never known for their readability <grin>.

Agree, comments make good sense on both Basic/C programs... and the use of good
variable names. Anytime a programmer drops back to using "i,j,x" for every
variable, he's writing hard-to-read code ;-).

I think you'd find that most Basic09 source code is commented (and has good
variable names) just as well as most C source code is.

The big diff to me is that development is faster using an interactively
semi-compiled language such as Basic09... you can try stuff out quicker. For
instance, when debugging the circle algorithm for the gfx driver, I first wrote
it up in Basic using integer math. I could quickly (very!) try out different
changes until it worked perfectly. Then the translation from Basic into 68K asm
was a piece of cake. Really. Sort of like:

                                move.w ycord(a2),d1
 REPEAT                   Loop: move.w foo,d0
  xcord = foo * ratio           mulu.w ratio(a2),d0
  run Plot(xcord,ycord)         bsr    Plot
 UNTIL ycord = 0                tst.w  d1
                                bne.s  Loop

I guess I'm acting the part of a C compiler, except my code will be smaller
;-). So for quick utils at least, I still write in Basic. I can mess around
until it works right, and without fear of crashing the machine with stray
pointers <hehe>. Granted, if I were more adept at C, I'd probably zing out
utils in it, instead. - kev

Although I have *NEVER* written a line of code in Microware Basic (OSK) or
Basic09 (on my CoCo), I *have* ported and written tons of "C" programs on both
systems. Because I use a mixture of systems with and without memory management
under OSK, I have seen how easy it is to write code in "C" with pointers that
point out to sea and "get away" with it. It is amazing how many programs (right
here in our dl's) are being used every day by OSK'ers that are potentially
causing sporadic and random system problems because of blown pointers that the
68000 cannot catch. I know because my 68030 system with SSM invoked (system
security) refuses to run them. With source, the fixes are almost always
trivial. I believe Kevin's comment about the relative "safety" of B09 vs "C"
has merit.
 I am not trying to scare people away from "C" - it is all I use (except for
assembler under dire circumstances). I dislike systems which require a runtime
module (runb) to operate. It's been so long since I wrote anything in Basic
(about 14 years) that I can't remember any of it anyway.
 Think of this as just a reminder that, in "C" and assembler, you can write
bugs into your code that will never be caught by most people's systems.

~ Well the main thing is if you know how to program basic09! If you write
spagetti code like Color Basic, Basic09 isn't any faster and hogs memory.
However if you use the loops and take advantage of its file handling and
modularity a good BBS can be done in basic09 without dirty code or forking 1000
shells.

Now with Basic09 on the MM/1 (I posted a file with my observations so far) we
have no barrier and multi-tasking is much better so a BBS could really fly!

The only part of my BBS thats in M/L is a ansi translator since I did need the
absolute most speed. yet interfacing it to Basic09 was cake! Basic09 can really
call other modules of any language and is easy to pass variables back & forth.
I see it as the best basic I ever used!

While writing the BBS I'm currently working on, I overcame one of my major
obstacles in writing large programs in BASIC09 - that is, the 64k barrier. Bill
Brady helped me understand how to overcome that. And, since I have, my BBS has
really taken off.  I can do so much more with it that the one I wrote in
RS-DOS. About the only time I ever use line numbers is ON-GOTO (I like C's
switch command) and when I need something to jump to another point in the
program and don't want to try and figure out how to loop it correctly.  And, of
course, for a BBS, I use GOSUBs for I/O.

Jim,
   Nope. I disagree. Basic (an easier language other than Pascal, C, etc.)
whether it is Basic09, IBM's GWBASIC, etc...will be around as long as there are
people who are in the beginning stage of programming (and as mentioned earlier,
who are proficient in Basic, and can write a quick utility in it).
   It's just too darn easy to write understandable english words (like CIRCLE,
or LINE, etc.) and give it co-ordinates when you're using your computer for the
first several months, than to figure out why your C program crashes because you
used a pointer when you shouldn't have, or forgot to declare some variables in
Pascal.

Microsoft has now bundled a QuickBasic interpreter with MS-DOS 5.0 (Yes 5.0). 
I've never seen the interpreter, but have used the QuickBasic compiler.  This
strikes me as a shot in the arm for BASIC since QuickBasic addresses many of
the criticisms against previous versions.  I hope that bundling BASIC with the
operating system cathes on again.  I provides the user with an easy way to add
functionality to their PERSONAL system even if it only comes from typing
listings from magazines.

caught on again, big grin!  Throwing in C doesn't hurt either!

Actually I was amazed at what I could do with plain old RS-Basic. It was very
fast to throw together a quick program utility. No variable declarations or
opening keywords as in B09 or C.

~ Yes and to point out with Basic09 is that its very much like standard Basic
in the fact it has easy to understand commands and syntax and has the english
commands with gfx2 (like circle, line, etc..) plus a wonderful debugger for
tracing problem code (which can't be done in C  but i THINK pascal has
something like it) then in the end you can PACK it and have a compiled module.
Basic09 in my view represents the best of both worlds to have a flexible
language and making quick changes and compiled code for speed.

Mike,
  Actually, I was supporting Basic! I think, at least for me, quick projects
are best done when completed in Basic. Other projects are best done in C when
the Libraries are only available in C (and this, mostly on other computers).
  Some basics are slower than a turtle, on the other hand, others are as quick
as other languages.
  I think the person's use of any language is what they are comfortable with
and what works, and as I mentioned in the other message, I doubt seriously that
Basic will become "passe'", as was remarked.

Jim,

Rexx would be nice. Also looking at other IPC mechanisms. There's no Rexx
manual uploaded anywhere, is there?

Basic: heh-heh, everyone has been saying that it's passe' for quite some time
now. Almost as dirty a word as "goto" in some forums <grin>. Still, more and
more people are writing into magazines wondering why it's put down... as it
still often is the first language learned by newcomers.

More importantly to this forum, OS-9 Basic is held in pretty high regard here.
Unlike many basics, Basic09 is very Pascal-like, very fast, and very useful.
It's not fancy (no built-in machine-specific commands), but very flexible.

Most BBS programs are written in it, many applications (including word
processors) are also, and anything you write in it can become yet another
command module to preload and/or call off disk. I myself, an avowed assembly
language nut, write most of my quickie utilities in basic09, as it's far easier
to write and interactively debug with, than C or asm are.

So while many people are getting into C here, Basic09 remains the structured
language of choice for many other OS9ers. See, we've been around so long that
passing fashions don't affect us <grin>. If we see something new, we chew it
over for a few years first, to see if it's the "right" way. Weird, eh?

Joseph,

I have downloaded your Basic09 Program called Ledger and am running into
difficulties running it.

It seems that when I invoke the program per the manual, I get an ERROR 043.
Since I have tried to run the program by the manual, I assume I have something
wrong with my set-up.

I am using the CoCo 3 with 512K. I have tried running the program using the
stock Shell and also, after downloading and installing Shell+, I have gotten
the same error. I further assume that the ERROR 043 is a Basic09 error which
translates to "Unknown Procedure" according to my OS9 Level II Docs. I have
both Basic09 and RunB in my execution (/dd/cmds) directory.

I was hoping you, or someone else could shed some light and help me out as I do
not know much about the technical ins and outs of Basic09 or even OS9 for that
matter.

Any help from anyone would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

David, you may not have SysCall and GFX2 in your current execution directory,
or (preferrably) merged with RunB.  If not, the best thing to do is merge
SysCall and GFX2 with RunB (at the end).  Try this and see if it works.

Joseph,

Ok, but is there any specific reason RunB should be at the end? I haven't
merged them until last night but RunB was not at the end. All seems to be OK
except for one small thing, which is minor.

It seems that when I am listing to the screen, some items are highlighted. I
thought at first it was just deposits but checks written are also highlighted
and it some are highlighted with different colors. I use a monochrome monitor
and the different shades, while legible, it just seems a little strange. If it
were only deposits and they all stayed the same shade it would be great.

Don't get me wrong, though. It is a nice program. What are the possibilities of
having reconciliations and editing in future versions. That would be nice too.

Anyway, thanks for the program. I intend to use it a great deal. With the
amount of checks we write, it is nice to know that we can do a quick search
when tracking down a payment or something.

Thanks again,

David

Joseph,

It was amazing. For some strange reason, I was thinking of the inkey procedure
on the Basic09 disk. I had an off-the-wall thought that maybe your program had
used that procedure and could not find it in my execution directory. I copied
inkey to my exec directory but still got the same error.

However, when I copied the procedure, i noticed syscall. I then went back and
copied syscall, gfx and gfx2 to my exec directory and Bingo!, the Ledger
program came to life.

I really don't know which of the files is being used but I am sure by trial and
error I will find out. Reading my Lev II docs would help, I'm sure.

Anyway, got it running and learning more about OS9 and Basic09 at the same
time. Thanks for getting my attention with Ledger, it has given me a chance (or
reason) for "cracking the books" and learning more.

Thanks to all of you who would have or are still going to respond. I greatly
appreciate the help.

David,

Since syscal is your 'portal' to the operating system, and Inkey handles
scanning the keyboard for input, I'm betting those are the culprits.

Most folks recommend merging syscall,Inkey, gfx and gfx2 with RunB. You'll save
valuable system resources as well as being assured of having everything you
need, when you need it.

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

I've been paging through the Computer Shopper checking out prices of hard
drives and it's getting me pretty confused. Of course, the fact that all the
advertisers there understand are MS-DOS machines doesn't help. And I dread the
day I call one of them and tell them what my machine is (it will be an MM/1).

Anyway, here are the questions:

1. When they talk about a SCSI drive, does this mean that a controller is
included? Or just that the drive will work with a SCSI controller? For example,
one ad lists a ST-125N-1 Seagate drive. Then it has a price for "alone", "8bit
XT Kit" and "16Bit AT Kit". The difference between the "alone" and "kit" prices
is about $30.00. So what is in the kit? Perhaps a MS-DOS type host adaptor?

2. I see SCSI controller cards (eg Seagate ST02) for XT/AT systems. Will these
work on something like the MM/1. Will I need a special SCSI drive to use one?

3. If I get a drive with a builtin controller would I be able to add SCSI
devices to my system later? How? Add to the host in the computer, or chain of
the existing drive?

4. I read some messages the other day about 512 byte and 256 byte sectors on
SCSI drives. Is this not something that is adjustable when the things are
formatted? Or does it depend on the drive?

This all seems to be quite complex to a software guy like me. Perhaps someone
in the know can do a brief primer on the subject and post it...

Sounds like Scott can fix you up (with answers, also). In the meantime,
simplified: a bus (usually via a cable) with devices hooked to it...

 SCSI
 cable
  0||<--> adapter <--> computer (computer often acts like controller)
  1||<--> separate SCSI/HD controller <-> drive1,drive2
  2||<--> embedded SCSI controller on hard drive
  3||<--> embedded SCSI controller on hard drive
  4||<--> embedded SCSI controller on tape drive
  5||<--> adapter <--> perhaps another computer
   || etc

Actually, "adapter" is misleading, as what you really have is just another SCSI
controller on the bus.... specific to the computer. Those embedded SCSI
controllers are likewise specific to the HD/tape/etc drive that they are part
of. So...

1. Right. "SCSI drive" means the controller is embedded in with the actual
drive electronics. So you just need to hook it via a cable [see 2,3 above]. A
regular ST506 HD (or often, several) can be hooked up to a standalone SCSI/HD
controller also, for example an Adaptec 4070 [see 1 above].

2. No, those cards are for a PC bus. The second expansion board on the MM/1 has
a SCSI interface, which means any SCSI drive hooks up with a 50-pin cable and
you're rolling.

3. Sure. You can have up to 7 SCSI devices on the cable (8, counting the main
computer). Each one has jumpers to set its "device ID" number.

4. I think some drives now are set to 512-bytes/sector, and you can't change it
(PClone influence there). Older drives allowed changing (like my old Rodime
20meg SCSI HD... it could be set to almost any size.. so I used 256 for my
CoCo).

Kevin,

Thanks for the SCSI dope.

I called a supplier the other day to get some prices and info. He told me (in a
very knowing way) that the controller board WAS needed with a SCSI drive and
that the ST01 controller was *both* a host AND a controller (just like the MFN
controllers...). Guess that is why he is still selling IBM-type stuff <grin>.

Now I'll have to decide what size of HD I'll be needing. The fellow I talked to
offered a 110meg drive for 900+ $$. That's too much for sure--plus, then a tape
backup would be essential. Can you imagine backing up that much data onto
floppies! With prices as they are probably something around 30meg seems to be
reasonable.

So the cable acts like a bus and the devices have select pins (I guess like
floppies do right now). Is it possible to connect more than 8 devices to a
system? (Not that I'll be able to afford that many, but...).

Am I right in assuming that in order to hook up a "normal" disk drive to the
SCSI "bus" one would need a SCSI controller card for the drive? I guess that
the select would be on the controller, not the drive.

Okay, this is starting to make sense. Thanks.

Righto... you'd need a scsi controller with it's own floppy drive 'adapter'
section, to use regular floppy drives. Perhaps embedded-scsi floppies will
become popular one day. Never know.

There's an extension to scsi which allows selecting up to 256 devices, but no
one uses it that i know about. Right now, the 8-bit data bus is used to
indicate who's talking to whom (each bit is the flag for one device)... which
is where the limitation comes from. [The data bus bits are used this way only
during the initial phase of making communication each time controllers wish to
talk to each other... otherwise they're data bits].

Yah, that dealer you talked to was selling scsi systems, but not really scsi
drives, in the way most people mean now.

Sidenote: os9 descriptor info doesn't mean much with embedded scsi drives...
because the drives themselves know how many heads/cylinders they have <grin>.
Basically, you need only tell an embedded drive to format itself, read or
write. It figures out the internal stuff itself, of course.

Kevin,

Actually, when in the course of our talks with Capitol Video I asked them what
their chief aggravations were in simulating CD-I titles, one of their biggest
complaints was that OS-9/UNIX could not actaully determine the PHYSICAL sectors
that were barfing in the CD-I image. The SCSI controller remapped all the bad
sectors out, and made the drive seem,once again, logically intact. Interesting
.... and somewhat of a future problem for multimedia moguls simulating their
applications off of hard drives.

I guess the biggest problem (although I really am NOT sure) is that, when
reading a realtime file with interleaved audio/video, the heads on the SCSI
drive actually reseek to find that remmapped sector, causing a hiccup, I guess.

These guys are in for a big shock then. A CD drive can only deliver raw data a
150K per sec, by the time the computer gets it. It is closer to 130K per sec. A
SCSI HD should be deliving 600-800K per sec, a re-seek is meaning less at that
speed. And on top of that the SCSI simulation will not deliver the P-Q
subchannels. Having worked for the past 2 months on a CD-ROM design time I can
vouch for those figures.

Mark,

Well! Thanks for the info! The real virtue of CD technology right now is the
storage volume, not the transfer rate or seek time. CD-I is really running up
against some bottlenecks on this, causing some grey hairs. Part of the problem
is CD technology, and the other part has been Philips Green Book spec, which
tried to specify that all titles be written to assume some incredibly long seek
time. Apparently, Philips wanted to antipate the creation of portable CD-I
devices that had slower mechanical performance. I understand that the Green
Book has since been slightly revised in that regard.

Still, even 130K per second is not bad -- and I know a couple of engineers that
are working with multimedia computers that have ways to smooth multimedia apps
over that hump. It DOES require DMA, SCSI, and caching.

The seek times are indeed long however if the drive file structure is optimized
for to reduce distance between the files the timing is bearable. I to have been
working with DMA and Caching, but the problems in a MMU related environment are
very nasty. I have had direct conversations with Philips in the Netherlands and
There person here in the US who defined the SCSI CD-ROM implimentation. After
our conversation They agreed there Standard was flawed. This leaves us with the
inability to use a SCSI approach for any thing approaching CD-ROM Multimedia at
the level that users will expect to have.

From what I understand the through-put is about 2x using this protocol, but not
if things are already compressed (like an AR file)? Also, do CIS nodes support
MNP?

Any advice on this will be appreciated.

Bob,

I'm in the process of making the same decisions on a modem.

At present, CIS MNP nodes support only a level 3 protocol as I understand it.
You can use a level 5 modem with a level 3, but yo'll only make use of the
'error correcting' capabilities here on CIS.

If you have a nasty line, MNP will make all the difference in the world.

Next problem, CIS is in the process of phasing in MNP support. Not all nodes
support it. GO PHONES to see if you have such a supported node.

You can use a level 5 modem with a non MNP modem ...it should just drop back to
normal mode.

With prices dropping like mad, I'm planning to get the level 5 support. (I _do_
have a supported node). That way, I'll have the capability if and when it
arrives here. In the meantime, I can make use of the features on the other
systems I use that support it.

I guess that getting one with MNP is probably the best idea. Even if it isn't

down my access time.

You bet Bob .... my thinking as well.

Just remember that MNP levels must be matched at each end, else it will drop
back to the lowest level of commonality.

For example, if you had a level 5 modem and called a system that supported
level 5 you'd get th bennefit of the error correction and the compression.

However, use your Level 5 modem to call a CIS level 3 node, all you'd get is
the error correction.

Tony,

The original printer driver timed out after a coupla seconds... which was
complained about (and patched in numerous files on BBSs and here), because most
programs couldn't deal with getting back an E$NotRdy error. And it really
goofed up people trying to single-sheet feed a printer.

So it was actually found that most people preferred no time out on the printer
driver. But you're right, it'd be good to have a way to check the status. Any
thoughts? Can't just check the busy line... would have to be a delay on that
status, etc. I can send you the original driver source if you wish.

Tony - what's happening is that the printer driver doesn't abort... it simply
waits until the printer is ready for the next character. Which could be
forever, of course. I suppose the driver could/should be rewritten to handle
some kind of ready? statcall (which would have to wait a second or two just in
case the printer is still busy, before returning the status).

Right now, I can think of two ways to handle it. One, fork another process
either to do the printing, which you can abort if it doesn't signal you that
it's started, or two, you could present a dialog box with "Please make sure
your printer is online" type of thing?

Tony,
 I use OSK, but I have a solution that will work. I used this back before OSK
had the alarm() calls. I wrote a program called timesig which took exactly 3
arguments: argv[1] is the process you want to signal, argv[2] is the signal to
send, and argv[3] is the time to wait (I used seconds). (Of course, argv[0] was
"timesig"). This way, you can os9fork() timesig to send yourself a signal in a
couple of seconds just before you do the write() and, if your write() returns
(-1), just check to see if you got the signal. Here's sort of what timesig
looked like:
 main(argc, argv)
 int argc;
 char *argv[];

As Pete mentioned, if you try to open a path to a device which is not
ready, the error code returned is 246 (E$NotRdy). If you use the C
Systemhfunction open(), it will simply return -1 on any open error.

Without seeing more of your code, it hard to tell. I tested the following
code segment on my system and it functions as expected, ie, clears the
second line of the display.

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    putchar(0x0c);
    puts("This data is on Line 1");
    puts("This data is on Line 2");
    puts("This data is on Line 3");
    tsleep(120);
    putchar(0x02);
    putchar(0x20);
    putchar(0x21);
    putchar(0x04);
    fflush(stdout);
    tsleep(120);
    putchar(0x02);
    putchar(0x20);
    putchar(0x2a);
    puts("Just one more line!");
}

Oh, and $0B is not just for graphics screens.

I guess I should do the error checking on the open() line, instead of the
write() line. But if somehow the printer was turned off or off-line between the
open() and the write(), how would you test for it. Aaas I said my program sits
and waits without printing any errors until I manually put the printer ON-LINE.
I like to make my programs as bullet-proof as possible. AS you can see, if I
can't detect a printer beong off-line, the program is full of holes. I'm not
sure how to upload code-fragments here or I would send yoy what I am working
with. Maybe I'll give you a call and we can do it over the phone. By looking at
the code you sent me, I'm not sure we are talking about the same situation. I
know how hard it is to get the big picture when your not actually looking at a
printout. TC

Tony,
     On buffered writes to SCF devices C uses I$WriteLn which activates line
editing at the op system level.  This filters out a lot of non-ASCII control
codes.  It's best to use the system call function write() to send control codes
to the screen, printer and such.  Try:

 char c;
 c=4;
 write(fileno(stdout),&c,1);

or if you have cgfx.l you can use:

 ErEOLine(fileno(stdout));

Tony,
     My reply refered to the second part of your message about why putchar(04)
didn't do what you wanted it to do.  For the printer try doing a
getstat(1,PATH).  If you're printer driver services the SS.RDY getstat call
this should return -1 if the printer is off line.  The standard LVL II bit
banger /p doesn't service the call by the way.  It always returns -1 and an
illegal service request error code in errno.

Dan must not have seen your request to modify the description of Top2, so I've
taken the liberty to fix it up for you.

Just so you know, the owner of any file in the library has the ability to
modify the description, keywords and title anytime after it has been merged
into the librariess.

Browse the file and use the CHAnge command at the disposition prompt. If you're
changing the description, you'll be placed in the EDIT editor (same as the one
we use for the message base) and at the _top_ of the current description. Use
the /type command to get yor bearings and then edit to your hearts content.

Any changes become effective immediately upon exiting the editor.

Fm: greg remington 76346,26
To: Robb Swanson 72567,1335

Robb, just saw your message, I'm doing software development for a
  small German image processing company, specializing in work for
  scientists, mostly Electron microscopists. Our hardware is all
  VME based, although we have our own image bus, you can't do real-
  time work at 20 MHz. We have our own frame grabbers, with and
  without real-time ALUs, FFT boards (sub-second 512x512 2D FFTs),
  Array processors, and lots more.  Send me a mail if you're interested in
literature.
  Just to give you a few hints about OS-9, we do all our development on our own
system. Coming from VAX/UNIX is a blow at first, but the TOPS utilities (many
thanks), and an OS-9 X Windows port to our CPU make it bearable.
  One tremendous advantage for system programmers (don't tell me you write bug
free software), is the fact that normal boot time is   about 30 secs. (with a
CMOS ram disk of 512k its less than 5   secs). I read many a good sci-fi novel
while waiting for a VAX or   Unix machine to boot after lightning or bad (read
my) system   programming.
  Complaints about disk time (it can be slow) during development are only a
problem for systems with limited RAM. For image processing systems with 4-64
Mb, a 1 Mb ram disk solves any caffeine overdose problems, I can't pick up my
cup faster... When you're done with
  development, throw out the ram disk if you need to!
  The lack of a good FORTRAN compiler is a thorn for some of our customers, but
the C compiler and debugger are acceptable, although nothing to write home
about. The important selling points for us
  were;

  - 4 Gb 680x0 linear address space
  - uSec interrupt latency
  - rich process communication tools
  - overall OS simplicity/clarity
  - OS manuals under 10 feet and 100 lbs

  We'll never go back...

While OS-9 (a cpu-portable version called OS-9000, actually) is available for

There is a double int function in clibt.l, I checked that. I also tried merging

The docs DO state an int sqrt() function plain as day on page 39. The double

Because C lets you sleaze out and not declare functions, assuming them to
return int.  sqrt() doesn't return an int, it returns a double--so the code
generated for main probably snarfs the least-significant sixteen bits of the
double returned and treats it like an int, which probably gives you a zero.

Either explicitly declare "double sqrt();" or put in the directive "#include
<math.h>".

 2) The versions of vi and stevie on the diskette, like the ones on their

delay when the termcap entry says to, but send out the numeric entry to the
terminal. This is in case you have a way to get feedback to them. Thanks for

Hi Mark!

I caught the '/h1/readme' problem.  Uploads beginning with disc 3 corrected
this problem.  If necessary, I can re-upload disks 1 and 2.

Re termcap support for 'stevie' and 'vi' - I'll send TOP a fax asking for a
correction (and/or source code).

Phillip, I have been using TSPELL for under Level II for a couple of years and
I have yet to experience the bug to which you are referring.  As a matter of
fact, it is running in another window right now.  Yep, and I am running it on a

   Has anyone messed around with converting the CoCo3 to a ROM based OS9
system? What would be involved or is it even possible ? Does it just involve
putting some EPROMS in the memory map in place of some of the RAM ?
   The purpose of putting OS9 in EPROM is to come up with an inexpensive
dedicated home controller.
   Any help or ideas are welcomed.

The only catch is that you'd have to use a larger EPROM... say 32K. Even on
most ROM based OS9 systems (well, the early ones), only the OS9p1 and Boot code
reside in ROM/EPROM. The rest is dragged in with the OS9Boot file. I'd say that
you might even be able to get away with a 16K EPROM if you were using an
extremely shaved down system.

Pete,
     I guess I have to do some more thinking about what I want. I was thinking
along the lines of eliminating the floppy drives, but after some more thought I
guess the drives would make it alot easier to change/update any of the control
routines. Maybe I should be thinking along the lines of a solid-state drive
with battery backup. Another possibility I guess would be to modify the CoCo3
so that if the power drops out the memory would be saved by a battery backup
system. I'm just not sure how OS9 would react. If a circuit detected that the
power has fallen below a set point, and this circuit then put the memory on
battery power while killing the power to the rest of the computer, how would
OS9 react when the power was restored? Would it start up from where it left off
?
   Just thinking out loud

Larry - in an MOTD not long ago, there was an article about a greenhouse
controller built around a coco-3 and os9. What they did was to use that 512K
battery-backed ram you see advertised in Rainbow. It was their ramdisk and boot
device. That allowed them to change things around, but still always reboot
after a power failure.

It might also be possible to write a special interrupt-driven driver, which
would be triggered by a coming power loss.... it would save out the entire
state of the machine to ramdisk (probably to a partition so it doesn't go thru
rbf) and set a flag for the reboot routine to reload that saved state and
return as if nothing had ever happened. Altho you'd probably want to note it in
the logbook <grin>.

Keven,  Thanks, I had forgotten about that article in MOTD. (oops i not e)

      Maybe you wouldn't need to worry about saving the current state if all
the state flags were on the ramdisk and all the program did was read and/or
update these flags. The program could be autostarted after reboot and just
start reading the sensors and checking/setting state flags.

   Have to give this some more thought......

I'd say best bet is to let the system reboot, and then have a startup script
(and other measures... say CRON based backups) that help you recover from the
power failure.

Hi, I need help from one of you programming gurus(of which I hope to be
one...someday).  I'm learning basic09.  The big question I have is why would I
ever want to use a sequential access file over a random access file.  Random
access files are faster (since there is no ascii conversion when "put"ting or
"get"ting data.  Also, you can find the position of any record easily with the
seek/size commands while putting data anywhere you specify.  Please don't let
me look toooooo dumb :-). Dave

Depends.  If records aren't of fixed length, it might be necessary to read a
file sequentially.  On the other hand, there may be various pieces of
index/pointer stuff in a file such that it isn't straightforward to read it
sequentially.  Also, some applications require reading every record, so you
might as well read it sequentially (and sequential access is more predictable,
so that any caching scheme is more likely to help you out with sequential
access).

Quite a few files can be read either way.

Not a very specific answer, but it depends enough on the application that I
can't give a very specific answer.  Time to snarf yourself a reference work on
data structures and file organization.

Hi David,

If you meant database files, then yup, a random access file makes more sense by
far. And as you said, the size/seek/get/put commands can be combined in very
powerful ways.

You'll still use sequential files for writing out reports, etc tho.

Ed,
  Scoot up to the LIB and BROwse the file. When you are at the "Disposition"
prompt, type:  CHA
   You'll be prompted if you want to change the Description, Keywords, and
Title. Answer accordingly on what you want to change. Do remember, when you
change to Description file, it's almost the same as if you were in the message
editor. So you can use the  /T (top) /Pxx (print xx lines) and such commands
like you were writing a message.

Piece of proverbial cake:

Copies the file listed in pathname1 to the file listed in pathname2. Examples:

 cp foo /dd/tmp/woof
 cp erf snerf
 cp /dd/cmds/dir /dd/cmds/ls

use 2:

 cp pathname1 pathname2 ... pathnameN directory

Copies all files named into the directory specified. The last argument MUST be
a directory (and is checked for that before any copying is done):

 cp *.c *.h /dd/tmp/C_sources
 cp /dd/cmds/* /dd/lib/* /dd/defs/* /dd/BIG_MOMMA_DIR

There's not all that much to it.  An OS-9 directory is a sequence of 32-byte
records, each containing either (1) NUL ($00) as the first byte, indicating an
entry that is not in use (when you delete a file, its entry in the directory is
marked inactive this way) or (2) a 29-byte file name, terminated by having the
MSB of the last character of its name set, and a 3-byte LSN for the file
descriptor sector of the file named in the first 29 bytes of the record.

If you're writing a utility to read directories, be sure to avoid endlessly
recurring by noticing the entries for "." and ".."!  (This is the voice of
experience speaking! <grin>)

The file descriptor sector contains, among other things, owner, time of
creation and last modification, and file size.

The gory details are all to be found in the section on RBF (the Random Block
file manager) in the OS-9 Technical Manual.

I have a couple questions about BASIC09.  Does something get messed up when you
use a GOSUB or call another procedure between EXITIF and ENDEXIT?  For example,
   EXITIF variable>2 THEN
   GOSUB 200
   ENDEXIT

   or

   EXITIF variable>2 THEN
   RUN program
   ENDEXIT

  In either of the above examples, control returns after the ENDEXIT not at the
bottom of the loop.  Am I doing something wrong or is this just a problem with
BASIC09?


Question 2: Sometimes, while in the trace mode, I'll hit a STOP in the my
program will end (of course).  However, from that point forward, all results of
variable manipulation are displayed whether I'm in trace or not.  Is there any
way to stop this other than restarting BASIC09?
