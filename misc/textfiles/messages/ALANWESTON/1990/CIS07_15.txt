Hey Paul,
        Another question on that second board.  Will it be available at the
same time as the MM1?  How much for the whole works?  If you can come up with
as good a deal on a hard drive as you seem to have on the case and power
supply, I'd like to hear that too!!
        July 20th, eh?  Pressure.  ARRRRGH  (hehe)

The second board WILL be available at the same time as the first board -no need
to worry.

Hard drive prices will be competitive, and we may add value to the drie by
preformatting it and including some PD stuff on it.

OK sooooo.... what does this mean?? The question I have is from a user who
wants to know the amount of RAM to have to develope in. On a terminal system
1-2 meg works out well. By this I mean you would load everything in RAM, set up
a RAM disk for C's LIB etc directories and temp files and then have enough left
to work in. It makes a big difference for C programmers to have everything in
RAM even if you have a fast HD. I used a QT20x with 2.5 Meg and had more than
enough though a QT00x with 1meg is tight. The video requirments of your GUI
will effect this. On a TC70 with 1.5meg it would work OK if the GUI only took
256K or so.

Anyway you see where I'm going with this. With memory prices dropping like they
are a dedicated C developer should just buy a couple megs and go nuts.

I guess my question is, What is the minimum RAM to run the GUI with say 2 or 3
windows and no graphics? Looks like what your are saying is that the GUI would
run Ok with about 128 or 256K dedicated to it leaving the rest for the system??

Ummm. What it means is: the RAM requirements of the video chip far outweigh the
memory requirements of the software.

The video is always in "graphics" mode (there is no "ROM text" mode as on the
coco or IBM displays). Each screen will always take a little more than 64K of
ram, minimum.

So it depends on how many screens the person has open. With 3 screens open in
80x26 mode (a pretty common situation), that's about 200K used for video. The
driver needs will come from non-video ram... round that off as 20K just for
fun.

C programmers always need more RAM <grin>. I agree that many people will jump
to 2-3 meg both because of the low cost, and because of the relatively large
video ram requirements.

Obviously if you increase the tempo, then the actual time decreases. I have a

Paul, QuickBasic is an outstanding implementation.  BASIC09 is somewhere in
between GW-BASIC and BASIC09--IMHO.  As I said in my earlier message, QB is
being bundled by Microsoft with version 5.0 of MS-DOS.  Some time ago I read
comments by Bill Gates in a magazine that BASIC would become a super powerful
batch language. Apparently, he feels that he has to get zillions of copies of
it out there to achieve that objective and I suspect he is right.  I can
remember wondering when I first used ms-dos why .BAT files were necessary at
all when BASIC was available, but I suspect that was because Microsoft bought
MS-DOS and .BAT processing was already built in. There are three areas where QB
represents an improvement over GW-BASIC (which, for purposes of this
discussion, we can consider roughly equivalent to RS-BASIC.):
  1). Runtime
  2). Language extensions
  3). Development Environment

The most wonderful is the development environment, but to take them in order:
RUNTIME The runtime code is fully compiled and therefore quite fast. Basic09,
of course, is pretty fast, too but uses a semi-compiled i-code.  In QB, the
developer can choose to compile and link so that no runtime module is required.
This simplifies running the program for the end user and you can distribute
your object module to any user who has MS-DOS.  Or the developer can compile
and link the same source so that a run time module is also required.  This
approach produces a smaller object module and saves disk space when you have
several programs that can share the runtime.  This runtime is more a collection
of executable modules like inkey than an interpreter like runb.  In any event,
you can obtain a license to distribute the runtime. Of course, all OS9 level II
users have runb because BASIC09 comes with level II.  I've forgotten what it's
like to have level 1.

(.....continued from last message)

LANGUAGE EXTENSIONS Line numbers are optional.  QB has a call like B09's run. 
However it also has line labels which can be used in GOTO and GOSUB commands. 
It also has a very complete set of control-flow statements including DO,
WHILE...WEND, IF...THEN...ELSE, FOR...NEXT, and SELECT CASE (similar to C's
switch).

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

WOW.  When you singlestep through source code a highlight bar appears on the
line of code about to be executed.  You can display variables of your choice in
a debug window.  You can set breakpoints throughout the code.  Include files
are supported (like C).  The integrated editor is far superior to the one used
with BASIC09.  All these features are controlled by a system of pull-down
menu's and dialog boxes that work with either keyboard or mouse.

~ Well my view on it it depends on what your writing. in some cases C would
make the program easier and in other cases basic09. I have written a bunch of
utilities in Basic09 that I doubt would be any better in C. However I can see
that some applications would be cumbersome or imposseble in basic09 since it
only has a finite instruction set. I would say map out what you want to do and
then decide what language to do it in.

remote terminal for my Amiga? Right now, remote CLI interfaces are possible on
the Amiga, but you can't run amiga GUI apps from the remote. Since Kevin's

Eet -

Unfortunately, there's a good reason why you don't see Amiga programs running
on remote GUI terminals... the programs often diddle directly with video
memory. Which kind of cuts out remote usage, unless perhaps someone rigged up
some hardware interrupts a la Bridgeboard wherein any write to Ami video memory
caused a program to go and echo that change to the remote. Can you say "slow"
<grimace>?

Those that don't diddle, but instead use only gfx library calls, could possibly
use a rewritten library that sends the commands to a remote terminal. Alas,
another stickler pops up: like many windowing systems, the Amiga OS allows
_programs_ to directly change gfx context info structures. What this means is
that a program could change, say, whether a menu item was enabled or not... but
without a new SetMenuStrip call, the remote would never know.

Of course, you could send the entire menu structure over on each mouse menubar
click, but ugh! The CoCo, btw, has one instance of this nasty... its menu
structure can also be changed, and without an UpdateMenuBar (UMBar) call, a
remote wouldn't know. And I betcha neither Amiga nor CoCo programmers make
those update calls for every little change (?). I gritted my teeth when I saw
this on the CoCo GUI. That kind of setup is written from the standpoint of a C
programmer, and goes against the cardinal rule (of mine ;-) that any change to
an OS structure should be done via the OS only.

Sorry. Got me fired up a little <grin>. - kev

Exactly! Not only would IF-THEN-ENDIF's be time consuming, it would be code and
memory consuming as well.  My favorite loop is the WHILE-DO.  It makes it real
nice for checking for proper input.  I mean this:
  press=""
  WHILE press<"1" or press>"5" DO
  PRINT "Enter choice (1-5) ";
  GET #0,press
  PRINT
  ENDWHILE

  is much better than this:

  10 A$=INKEY$
  20 IF A$="" THEN 10
  30 IF A$<"1" OR A$>"5" THEN 10

Just finished having a look at the new clib docs. Great job.

However, two files seem to be missing from the archive: system.txt and

In assembling the new mroff I had to change the #include <scfstat.h> to a
#include <sgstat.h> and make some changes to sgstat.h since I do not have a
copy of scfstat.h.... not a problem, but could be pretty frustrating to a

Whew!  This was a long monster to do (almost two years in the making).  I'd

Look in DL3 for a file HEADER.AR or something like that from me.  It has all
the header files you need to run Carls library.  The only difference between
scfstat.h and sgstat.h is the former doesn't have the structure for the rbf

  Look in Lib10 later today for MEMBE7S.AR.  It includes 3 files - MemberDir,
Tele, and Member.dir.

  MemberDir scans your message capture file for the "Fm:" prompt, checks for
already being on file, and if not, adds it to Member.dir.

  Tele opena an overlay window and scrolls thru the Member.dir file 12 names at
a time, and you can use the arrow keys to select a name and PPN that you want. 
The overlay window closes and the name and PPN are printed to the current

Assuming you're using a coco, there are patches to CC3Disk that can be made,
and then you can run Bob Santy's PCDOS utilities. That'll allow you to
read/write DOS disks in the Coco3 under OS9/LII. The files are in DL10. Try a
BRO/KEY: *DOS

Fm: George Hendrickson 71071,2003
To: all

I am new to OS9 and need some information on reading OS9 directorys. I am
getting ready to write a utility for my OS9 BBS (George's
 Dewdrop Inn) and need to know the formula for converting information taken
from reading the directory into a 'dir e' type thing. There is a program called
DSORT.B09 in the dloads that reads the directory and sorts it from opening a
dir path. When looking at the varibles (printing them) I see alot of 'garbage'
characters. My question is, How do I convert each record into something
readable? The program sets up the records using 'TYPE' and the LSN varibles.
Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks George

  To add to Shawn's reply, the 2-3 minute tv blurb (complete with cute baby)
stated that ALL the electrical/electronic stuff in the home was capable of
being controlled by the CEBus & controller.  Diablo Systems is the
developer/mfg.  Not sure of the city, but I'd bet that they're in Concord, CA
or someplace nearby.  Will try and find out if you're interested.

  TV spot had short scenes of family watching TV - doorbell rings & display
switches to front door camera;  commercial comes on - display switches to
baby's room;  garage door activated in AM - controller says to house "ok,
family has gone, start dishwasher, power down unneeded lights, etc., set

Our UPS for our mainframe is the source of its power.  The mainframe IS running
off the UPS batteries all the time.  The power lines from the electric company
are constantly recharging the Uninteruptible Power Supply batteries.  That way
when a power outage occurs there is NO switch over to worry about that might
cause a glitch of some kind.
   If you could get a UPS for your CoCo that could maintain the system during a
typical outage (probably 1 to 5 minutes in most cases), and the system was
contantly running off the batteries and the incoming current was constantly
feeding the UPS recharge circuits, then it would be smooth sailing or
monitoring or controlling...

Just a thought, anyway.

  You are right, that would completely end the power/down, power/up, reboot,

UPS' do cost a lot, but the coco itself can be run off batteries for a few
hours (depends on battery... I've seen a cig-pack sized nicad run one for 3
hours or so).

An addendum after reading some other replies.  If a running UPS was used as I
described earlier, then you could still have a process that monitored the
incoming power line, if it went dead, then a flag could be set that told the
process to check the line again in 30 seconds.  If it was back up, then simply
reset the flag and go back to sleep and wait for your normal power line
checking interval to pop.  If the incoming power is still down in thirty
seconds, then increment a counter, got to sleep, and wake up in 30 seconds to
check it again.  After the counter being incremented has reached a value which
is comensurate with the UPS's ability to keep the system up properly, then a
critical phase has been reached, where drastic measures must be taken. What are
those drastic measures?  Whatever things that must be done to "save" the system
status somewhere (possibly in a static RAM buffer) in preparation for the
impending doom.  The check routine could then go into a "save" routine each
time that it "found" that it still alive and kicking.  Of course, it would
still be checking the incoming power source, too, just in case power was
restored.

Is it do-able?  Or unthinkable?

Dennis -

F$GBlkMp returns the info you need; including the block size, which is needed
if your driver were to work on other OS9 systems.

However, the buffer size required is a lot to ask from system space... and you
said that this was for the coco3 only, so:

Look in the direct page variables, and you can determine where and how big the
block map is.

 $0040-41 D.BlkMap - points to start of block map
 $0042-43 [noname] - points to end of block map + 1

128,256, and 512K coco's will have those set to $0200 and $0240... that is, $40
blocks of RAM. The trick is, the smaller memory machines will have "NotRAM"
($80) bytes set in some of the blockmap. By subtracting out the number of
notram blocks, you can figure up total memory size. The 1024K machines will
have a blockmap size of $80 ($0200-0280).

So: total blocks = [$0042] - [$0040] - (number of blocks in map set to $80).
    total RAM    = total blocks * 8K

Refs: NotRAM defined in os9defs. D.BlkMap on page 2-1-3 my book. Blockmap
example on page 2-1-5 my book. [noname] not defined anywhere <grin>.

Yup - determining machine memory is indeed an easy task when you know that the

info is fairly well-documented.

The Kreider library documents look great!  They are a great improvement over

1. The following files have lines which exceed 80 characters in width when the
line and page indent is included: conv.txt, gs_rdy.txt, password.txt and
unixtime.txt.  Because of the tight page spacing, this throws off the page
formatting for all following pages.

2. The .sh macro in setstat.txt is missing its <.>.

3. The sleep.txt and system.txt files are missing from the archive file.

4. Mroff.mdoc is missing all sections after 7.1. Based on the cross-reference

I can fix the first two items but would appreciate the missing files and the

To:  76703,4227 (X)

Kev,

The MM1 ads state that it has an 32 bit expansion bus. However the 68070 in the
MM1 is 16 bits and you are instructed to discard the MM1 when you move to the
32 bit bus. Several callers asked about this thinking that the MM1 could be
expanded on this 32 bit bus. Unless my math is wrong or I've become very stupid
you can't run a 16 bit CPU on a 32 bit bus. If you could it would serve no
purpose whatsoever. Before I add this to my next QnA upload I want to make sure
I'm not missing anything.

Can you really expand the MM1 with a 32 bit bus and if so how? Is this just ad
hype?

Frank

PS. Remember the old SWTPC ads with a 25 Amp bridge rectifier? Used to get
Gimix really ticked because they had a 25 Amp power supply and the SWTPC only
had a 8 Amp power supply. Yet the SWTPC ads said it had a 25 Amp bridge
rectifier with no mention of capacity of the supply itself.

Sounds familiar.

I see no reason why you cant run a 16bit cpu on a 32 bit buss There are a
couple of reasons it could be usefull. 32 bit memory to memory DMA, Slave 32bit
DSP's, Slaved 32 bit CPU, and maybe even a math co-processor. All though I will
agree its overkill, not to mention costly.

To: Mark S 76004,373

Yes I see your point, but as I understand it the MM1's memory is restricted to
the 2nd board so memory to memory DMA would not work. I don't know if their bus
would support slaved CPUs etc. But if the memory could not be on the bus none
of your suggestions would work.. would they??

Your point of overkill and costly is why the K-Bus is only 16 bits. It was
designed to be low cost and match the 16 bit CPUs. We can and do run a '30 on
the bus with good results and speed. Our paper calcs show we are only losing 5%
over what a full 32 bit bus would give us. If these run true then 5% is a small
gain for the added cost of the extra bits. We are also planning a CPU card with
on-board memory that would overcome most of that loss. I guess it's a
compromise (sp?) between cost and practical operations.

 I'm not referring to the ability to Read/Write MS-DOS disks, but the
capability of running an .EXE file. (A friend I know has an Amiga with this
capability.) Thanks for your response, Rich Ries

Nam - I don't believe there is yet. Several people have looked into it (me
included), but the docs are really tough going and vague, and I believe it
requires the full attention of the cpu, anyway. Have SCSI tape drives come down
in price lately?
