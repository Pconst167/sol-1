Hi Kevin:

It's been awhile since Iv'e been able to sit down with my CoCo and play. Been a
busy summer! But any way, now it's time to start to think about my hobby (?)
again.

Through out the summer Iv'e been trying to decide on eather a hard drive or a
1Meg upgrade. Well I just couldn't decide, so a compromise. Just have to get
both.

Now this is where you come in. I'm going for the hard drive first, it will get
me more of what I'm after right now. So this is where I stand now, I have a
CoCo 3, Disto 512K upgrade, Disto Super Controller I (the II hadn't come out
yet)w/ 3in1 board, Bob Puppo's keyboard interface. I have an MPI, but don't use
it at this time. What do you think would be the way to go? Get a 4in1 board,and
piece togeather a SCSI system, or maybe pick up a MEB and SCSI board from Disto
and go to the MPI, and put togeather a SCSI system, or go to the MPI and get a
Burke & Burke system.

I Don't want to lose the use of the RTC, parallel port, or RS232 port. Also
with the Disto SCSI system will I get no halt access? In the checking Iv'e done
so far, the MEB/MPI setup would be the least expensive, the 4in1 the neatest,
and the Burke & Burke the simplest. What do you think?

Don't you just love this stuff.

Well...I've managed to put off buying the 1 Mbyte upgrade for some time now,
and it's not impeded my use of my CoCo in one sense, though on the other hand,
it *has* held me back in some ways, because there are things I'd leave going in
the background all the time (MultiVue, cron or something like it, and so forth)
if I had the memory.  I've put it off sufficiently that I may not ever do it,
since I now think an MM/1 is a better place to put my $$$.  Were I you, I'd
give serious thought to an MM/1, but putting that aside, I'd say that I don't
think I'd trade my hard disk for the extra 512Kbytes.

James:

That's why I kind of went with the idea of going with the hard drive first.
I've been useing a RAMdisk alot for speed, and maybe with a hard drive I'll be
able to use that memory.

Even though I've had Multi-vue since before I got my 3, I've just now started
to use it. I like it pretty well, and maybe now my wife will start to use this
thing. Before she said it was just too hard to get it to do what she wanted it
to, and I'm hoping that a hard drive will speed the process up some. (Kind of
slow with just floppies!)

I've given some thought to the new machines, though I would go with the TomCat
rather than the MM/1. I like the expandability of the FHL machine, but when it
comes right down to it, I don't really stress this thing. About all I do is
some word processing, use DynaCalc and Profile to do my budget and keep track
of it, and pop on CIS about twice a week. That with some dabbling with
programming, and it's a little hard to justify putting out a grand+ for
something I would most likely be doing the same thing with. When this dies I
will be moving up, but until then I just can't see it.

Besides, when I move up, I'll most likely want a hard drive anyway.

Sounds reasonable to me.  If you do think there's any chance of your moving up,
be sure to get a hard drive that will work with the system you're thinking of
going to.  In the case of the MM/1, that means SCSI--dunno about the FHL boxes.

Trying out a simple "if (x >= 5) arf(); if (5 >= x) arf();" does not display
the problem--indeed, if the compiler were that confused, I'd be surprised that
much of anything worked at all.  When reporting bugs (and reporting them to
Microware officially is the best thing to do, lest they get forgotten), example
code, made as short as possible to simplify finding and correcting the problem,
along with the edition numbers of the software in question, helps a great deal.
(Tried again just now in another window, using explicit casts--no difference.)

So...I can't duplicate the stated problem, so I can't say that I've noticed
that.

Greg,

While I didn't ask the origional question, I am remotely interested in a TSMON
that supports modems for OSK.

Some thoughts on programming Hayes "compatible" modems...

They will only connect at speeds up to the one they are initialized with. I.e.
if you initialize the modem at 1200 BPS, it will NOT connect at 2400 BPS even
if the caller is capable of it.  I'd just start at 19.2KB and then work
downwards until I got an intelligible response and mark that as my maximum
speed.

I agree that using the text answers from the modem is the way to go.  There is
no standard for the numeric codes above 1200 BPS.

The product ID code (ATI) is useless for determining the type of modem attached
since other "compatible" modems don't return the same response that the
equivalent Hayes modems do.

It is a good idea to send the initialization strings to the modem one at a time
instead of grouping them together like "ats0=1V1X4" because we had a (in)
"compatible" modem that was sensitive to the ORDER of the commands sent.  (I
was ready to give the manufacturer a REAL nasty phone call and I *REALLY*
wanted to tell the customer to go buy a real modem but the jerks in sales nixed
that idea. <slight grin>)

Some modems don't like lower case.

Different modems have differing amounts of time needed between lowering/raising
signals and sending them a command.

Which leads one to the conclusion that there is NO SUCH THING AS A HAYES
COMPATIBLE MODEM!  (In fact Hayes themselves said this in a large format ad a
while back that we programmers gleefully posted on the wall at work in
agreement.)


While I'd like to have a modem capable TSMON available someday, right now I've
got too many irons in the fire to do anything about it myself.

Regards,

-J

Dunno about your OS9, but the Developer's Pak for the CoCo came with an "rdump"
util... it shows the table of names/values used in linkable files. I think Carl
K is the resident expert on this stuff (well, and JJ of course). I'm a novice
at it.

Rammer: pretty sleazy piece of code, actually <grin>.  Correct approach of
course is to map in blocks legally.  But I was after speed etc, and I see
drivers as being able to legally do anything they want (as long as they don't
futz up other drivers).

Why shut off interrupts?  Two main reasons.

 1. CoCo interrupts can cause an entire map change due to the need to move to
the second 64K system map, where the gfx cursors code is.  On return, the
original system map is replaced, not the one Rammer may have rammed into the
GIME.
 2. More importantly, any interrupt requires that the system map be genuine, as
OS9 doesn't reset the DAT (at least, on DATs with more than one map available)
when it goes into system mode.  So the DAT info could be quite bad and the
system would crash and burn.

In other words, OS9 wouldn't know that someone had diddled with the system DAT
info... and it sure wouldn't know how to reset it after an interrupt. Does that
make sense?  You could insert a good block entry into the system DATImage, and
then you'd be legal, but the trouble there was that if the system map is full
up, a ramdisk like this couldn't work. - kev

Kev - I am looking at a version of RAMMER modified by ?? (name escapes me at
momment). Claims yo have made some minor mods. In any case THIS version does an
OS9 F$MapBlk which should result in legal dat image. I too wondered about any
blocks being free, but it seems to me that OS9 MUST keep at least one DAT slot
free as a "scratch" if only to map different I/O pages etc. But I dont know for
sure, and maybe in a 4K system it can afford too, but in 8K not. Anyway I
figured if RAMMER works with a F$MapBlk then any other I/O modulre should also.
In case you are wondering I am looking at rewritting Pipeman Imagine an I/O
device using F$LDABX to trnasfer 1 byte at a time. That's 37 cycles per byte
minimum, plus the overhead of the SWI2 call! Anyway I figured it was time I
tackled a Manager and pipeman is the easiest one to do. Do you still see it
necessary to disable interrupts in this case? <greg Morse>

Greg - this is offhand, but...

No, I cheated badly and didn't use F$MapBlk at all, so someone did some
extensive changes in the version you have.  In any case, ummmm, OS9 doesn't
keep any blocks in the system map free.  So if the MapBlk could fail if things
are hot and heavy (less so in your 4K system of course).

The kernel's F$LDABX etc commands are hardcoded to directly map in the desired
external block at logical $0000 in the system map... for speed, and because OS9
always knows that block 00 is located there.  That is, it can always zap the
DAT to grab/write a byte, and reset that first DAT block to 00 with impunity. 
Of course, it shuts off interrupts before doing so <grin>.  Thus a driver which
does the same thing is cool, just not useable on other hardware (just as the
kernel isn't).

Sounds like fun (messing with Pipeman)... good idea, too, as Pipes are rather
slow, as you said.  Yell if you need anything! best - kev

I believe.

Yup--lorder output is intended to go into a topological sort program, because
in a proper library, that dependency induces a partial ordering, and the .r

You can concatenate the .r files together, but they have to be in a particular

really need to modify the lorder program I uploaded here to handle either .r

Greg,
  If you are running OSK, there are two programs called merge and rdump,
that will create a library.  The best way is to create a file listing
the .r modules one per line then typing the command:

      merge -z=<libname.file >libname.l;rdump -l <libname.l

The "l" option for rdump will automatically tell you the proper order,
if any.  Then all you have to do is edit libname.file.
  I would't customize any std library files unless you want to redo them
every time you update the compiler!
  Hope this helps.

P.S. Think a librarian might be a good thing to have?

 Sure, why not? I wrote the command with make in mind.  Create the
lib.name file, drop out of the editor into the os, type make, then back
into the editor to make any changes required. 

  What I think we need is a utility or utilities for OSK to check the
module order, put the modules into proper order and to split the .l file
back into the individual .r files so one or more individual .r files can
be recompiled without recompiling the entire source. Saving all those .r
files takes up disk space needlessly.

Library files are just a merge of .r files.... nuthin' fancy. You may get into
a bit bit of a problem if using cross generations of the RMA/C.ASM RLINK/C.LINK
pairs, as later versions add an extra integer to ' each .r module for 'common
block' support (Fortran). The newer vintage understands the older format, but
not vice versa.

For the most part, if you're noting using the tools from the coco development

Don,

I see you are a fellow Wordpak fan.  If you're not aware of it, a while back I
uploaded a group of files to let you utilize a Wordpak RS under Level II.  Come
to think of it, I believe I've improved that since.  Let me know if you're
interested, and I'll uprgrade the upload.  Not for the Wordpak I (or II - was
there a Wordpak II?), just the RS.

Paul,

Been discussing your favorite topic with a friend in Florida when a question
came up I didn't have an answer for:

Is there a cap on how many serial ports the MM/1 can support?

If I decipher your Insider correctly, it would appear 5 ports are mentioned in
one way or another ... but it's not clear if that's all ... or if more can be
added.

What's the real info?

Hi Floyd... Thanks. I also found a problem in GemQuest. One one screen - I
can't remember which one - if you go right instead of down from the top of the
ladder on the right side of the screen, it dies with the same 55 error as tank.
I'll try to recreate it and let ya know which screen. It's not a huge problem,
cause you aren't supposed to be able to go right - I just bumped the joystick
the wrong way...

The ipatch I created to fix some of the bugs in my games will correct the error
55 in Gem Quest.  The file is called DDPATCH.PAK in library 10.  Or, if you

Fm: Ken Drexler 75126,3427
To: All

I need some help with localtime() in the Kreider library.  I need to use it to
break down the value returned by time() into months, days and years.  The only
problem is that the data returned is in the tm structure is ALWAYS March 6,
2106.

Is there a bug in localtime? or have I missed something?

Here is my code and a dump of the output:

#include <utime.h>

main()
    {
    long  curtime;                   /* current date time */
    struct tm *t, tim;                  /* tim for sizeof */

    pflinit();                    /* enable long printing */
    curtime = time( (long *) 0);
    printf("curtime:  %ld, curtime/86,400: %ld\n",curtime,curtime/86400);
    t = localtime( curtime );
    printf("tm_sec: %d, tm_min: %d, tm_hour: %d, tm_mday: %d, tm_mon: %d,
                    tm_year: %d\n",
          t->tm_sec, t->tm_min, t->tm_hour, t->tm_mday, t->tm_mon,
                    t->tm_year);
    _dump("tm:\n",t, sizeof(tim) );
    }

OUTPUT: curtime:  653435281, curtime/86,400: 7562 tm_sec: 15, tm_min: 28,
tm_hour: 6, tm_mday: 6, tm_mon: 2, tm_year: 206 tm:

       1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f  0  123456789abcdef0

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................

Has anyone else had this problem? What am I doing wrong?

(I also note that the heading on _dump is wrong and the function sends its
output to stderr not stdout as the clib documents say.)

Thanks for the help.

Alas, many Unix-inspired functions take pointers as arguments where one would
expect to pass the values instead, and hand back a result by modifying some
<expletive> global variable.  I bet localtime() is one such function, and that
you get to hand it a pointer of some sort.  Look at the docs closely.

Hmm... looks like this may be an age old gotcha.... did you define time() as a
function that returns a long?

i.e.   'long time();       /* no C */'

I think so.  utime.h includes that declaration so I figured that #including it
provided the needed declaration.  The output suggests that it does because
curtime looks right i.e. 7562 days after 1970 is a day in 1990.

Have you used localtime() to break down the value returned by time()? If so
(and your code worked) what did it look like?

Yep - I have used localtime() a lot.... works ducky. One thing that used to

int _julian(time,date) int *time,               /* pointer to time value */
    *date;               /* pointer to date value */

Your question is very timely.  Just yesterday I put the finishing touches on
modifying (actually correcting) the Microcom Ramdisk package to work with the 1
Meg memory upgrade.  Up to 800K in size, sets up and formats in a wink, size
selectable at setup, recovers (most of the time) from a system crash, undoable
to recover system memory.  Comes with a quick device-to- device copy utility. 
They should have it in a week or so.

 I've got a few questions tho, after reading theispec sheet :

o   Does the Extended (I/O board) come with 0K?  For some reason, I was under
the impression that it came with another meg or so of RAM.

o   Network interface: is this a proprietary networking scheme, or is it based
on an established protocol of some sort?

o   MIDI interface:  same as above (I'm a complete newbie as far as MIDI goes,
but am sure I'll be asked if it's a standard implementation).

Glad you got the Insider! I'd like to hear your reactions to it, suggestions
for other stuff you'd like to see, etc.

The extended board comes with 0K, but you can add either 2MB or 8MB worth of
SIMMs.

The tentative network scheme involves using high-speed serial and NFM
(Microware's standard network file manager). Any number of protocols can be
implemented on it including Ethernet, Arcnet, etc.

MIDI will conform to MIDI spec 1.0. That's as established a protocol as you can
get.

Sb: #HardDrive Problem
Fm: james pottage 71750,2012
To: Kevin Darling

Kevin, this is a short note to give you a better idea of the problems I am
having with the SCSI Seagate 125N hard drive. The drive seems to function well
after the system has booted up. The problem seems to be in the boot. When I
boot up the system does not change the data and execution directories to the
hard drive. It appears that the system may try to change directories because
the light on the hard drive comes on during the boot for a breif moment. Once
the system has booted I can then type chd /h0 and chx /h0/cmds (or to /dd which
is the harddrive as well). This usually works fine, however, once in a while I
get an error 247 - seek error. This goes away after a second attempt to change
directories to the hardDrive. Moreover, if I press reset after booting (without
changing directories) the system  will boot with no problems ie. it changes
directories to the hardDrive and then runs startup off the harddrive. This
sequence of problem will happens even if the system has been running for a
while and a cold start is then done(ie the system coco is turned off and then
dos is used to start again - and the hard drive is left running the whole
time.) I have tried changing the CC3GO module and this has had no effect on the
boot. I am presently using the drivers for the Disto Super Controller 2 in 1
board - harddrive and serial port. I believe that these drivers were not
written by you. Would the 4 in 1 drivers which you wrote work on this system.
Oh yea one more thing, the hard drive is occasionnally accessed by the system
for no apparent reason ie. the harddrive runs when the program in memory (like
VED) should not be using the drive.

Jim - haven't forgotten about you; just couldn't think of anything <grin>.
Hmmm...

Coupla ideas tonight.  First, are you using a Multipak, and if so, has it been
upgraded?

Also, is the drive desc set up for embedded SCSI drives?  That is, is the
control word stuff set to zero?  (I forget what utils Disto provides to set
this; some kind of custom "dmode" command?).

And (sorry if this is a repeat Q), has it always acted this way? thx! - kev

Another note: when you say that the HD is accessed at times, even if nothing
should be going on, do you mean the drive light comes on?   Or just that you
hear the drive seeking around every once in a while?  That last is normal, as
many drives autopark themselves (and/or re-align themselves, I think) after a
period of inactivity.

To: all

Two news items of note on CD-I, which uses the OS-9 operating system:

"Photo CD" is a new photographic system -- jointly developed between Kodak and
Philips -- that can scan 35 mm images and write them on compact discs for later
playback by consumers on Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-I) players, CD ROM-XA
systems, and dedicated Photo CD players.

Gaston Bastiaens, director of Philip's interactive media systems group, said,
"Photo CD will extend the application possibilities of the CD-I system."

CD-I was also explained as a key stimulus for the development of the new
Motorola 68340 "data movement engine", which will be used to enhance future
CD-I systems.  The 68340 is an integrated device based around a 68020 cpu core.
On-chip peripherals include 32-bit dual channel DMA, timers, serial.

CD-I players turn televisions and stereos into interactive entertainment and
information centers, combining high quality sound, text, still image and full
motion video, computer graphics and data on CDs.  Developed by Sony/Phillips,
CD-I will be the world standard for interactive CD applications.  Consumer
players will be introduced in the United States and Japan in 1991, Europe in
1992.  Many publishers are already preparing titles for the consumer launch.

You'll need to look for the system calls that are being made there, and convert
them to the corresponding OSK C library call.  os9.h is a header that includes
a 6809 register image for a call that exists only in the 6809 library.

scfstat.h could probably be replaced with sgstat.h; I'd have to look to make
sure, though.

Ed,

The 232pak expect a high  DTR signal before it will listen to anything. Your
modem might be able to do this (dip switch or command) or you could jumper a
cable with 6-8 and 20 hooked together.

What type of modem are you using? Do you see any activity on the light (are
there lights?).

    one of those units from rat shack that goes in-line and has several

    i've been going with the switch in force carrier detect position, i'll

Is it possible that you've patched xcom9 and bbterm to use T1 for the bitbang
driver?

Do you have type (parity) and baud values set properly for T2?

Did you remember to include ACIAPAK and T2 in your boot file?

What are you using for a cable between your modem and the serial port?

Tell us a little more about what you've done, and what happens when it fails

    ok, here it is...
        patched xcom9 and bbterm?  no, instead i used the BITBANG.ar
descriptors        and driver when i was using xcom9 and bbterm through the
        bit banger.
        type and parity were set properly
        ACIAPAK and T2 are in the boot file. (i used a fresh copy of the
        system master to boot with)
        the cable is a 6' shielded rs232 cable from radio shack.
        i also installed the jumpers between pins 6, 8, and 20 as
        i was advised in a prievious msg here.
        this setup works fine with BOTH the telcom package in the
        level 1 version of deskmate, AND with Ultimaterm. (am using
        Ultimaterm and the above setup now)
        bbterm starts up normally, but in terminal mode, nothing is echoed
        to the screen, and none of the AT commands give any responce from
        the modem.
        xcom9 also starts normally, but echo's random characters,
        the following is an example....
ff`ff~`Fxf~`@f`f`~~x~``fx`~~xxx`fxfxf`~fxfffff`d~`xxfx>ffx~~fx`x`~~`xx~`f~~xx@f~`f~f``f`fff~ffff>ffff8ffff~xxf~f|~fdf~fffFf~fff
ffDxffDff~8ff

     this looks similar to what i've seen when Ultimaterms baud rate
        was not set correctly, however i got this output after i had
        used XMODE to set the type and baud.  (though i also got the
        same kind of output before using XMODE too)

          thanks for any help...

Joseph,

Concerningg your Ledger 4.5 program, I think it is great! The edits come in
handy.

However, there are a coupla things I noticed. After editting a transaction, the
balances are not correct. I am not sure (I haven't delved into it in a couple
of weeks) but I think the program fails to read deposits after the edit or
vice-versa (but always AFTER the edit). I will look into it more closely.

Also, is there any way to change the screen colors? The reason I ask is because
I use a monochrome monitor and some of the highlights fade and can barely be
read. Some of the things I noticed were the default selections, the main menu
and the deposits on the Transaction Query options. On the deposits, and I can't
tell you what colors they are, but the are a light color with dark characters.
These are very hard to read.

Those are the only two things that I have noticed so far. The colors are an
irrritating thing but the miscalculation problem can be devastating.


Thanks for your help,

David-edit bug also.  I found that it works fine with correct entries but that if
something is off, everything else is thrown off, also--due to the logic I
implemented in the recalculation portion.  I will fix that.  Third: changing
screen colors, yes, I can arrange that.  My new version will be 5.0, with
greatly enhanced features, a new record type (which will require a program to
change the data from the old (pre-5.0) record format to the new format) and
lotsa little goodies (of which I could easily implement a color selection). 
However, it will be several weeks forthcoming, prob'ly a couple of months.  For
the color right now, there's not much I can do now, but I have noticed a way to
work around the recalculation bug (which usually works?!?!?)--try editing the
entry previous to the entry in error, and edit the data to contain the same
data that was there before--in effect, not changing the entry, but it should
provide an accurate recaluon of the entries afterwards.  Hope this helps.

If you have any other questions, comments, please leave them to me!  I
appreciate the effort to give me feedback, as this is an essential portion of
software development.  Thank you for your time.

Kevin
     Thanks for your help with the device driver for the J&M. I have come to
the conclusion that it just plain needs a new driver/descriptor for level II. I
was able to FORMAT the drive with the program supplied in the original package,
so that rules out hardware problems. (that program didn't bother with
drivers/descriptors but it did work under level II).
 Two questions before tackling this l-o-n-g term project.
   The defs files for level II will be different and will be found in the
developers kit - yes ( sigh ) and
   Will the coco II version of dynamite be appropriate for level II drivers as
it also had a defs file and
   If it won't work can you direct me to a disassembler which will be
appropriate for level II defs.
  All this because I couldn't find a decent wordprocessor that would run on
WORDPAK RS  to do my resume on the hard drive !
 Rather like eating your way out of a warehouse full of
 twinkies!

I've messed with J&M hard drives on a friend's system a coupla years back... I
don't recall any changes needed (other than making quite sure that the address
byte we mentioned before is changed... that's mandatory in the descriptor).  I
can send you some code to look at, tho.

Also, I forgot to ask... are you using a Multipak?  Has it been upgraded, if
yes?

Very few drivers actually need L-II defs; but I think you can still find a copy
of most of them over on the Microware display area (GO MSC and look in the 6809
section... if it's still there.. hmmm... I'm not sure it is!).

    I JUST TOOK OUT MY DRIVE
  (ORIGINAL) FROM MY FD500 TO PUT IN TWO TEAC 55B'S
  NOW I CAN'T GET THEM TO WORK.

   I WANTED D0 + D1 ,QUESTION: CAN IT BE DONE FOR LESS THAN $50?



               I'M TYPING THIS OUT ON MY RS232 PAK (NOT MY USUAL DESKMATE
TERMINAL)

               ANY SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE APPRECIATED.

Andy - if you leave in just one Teac, does it work?  Have you set the drive
select jumpers on the drives to d0 and d1? (or d1 and d2, on some drives;
whichever are first).

Does the FD500 drive cable (the 34-pin cable) have some teeth pulled on it?
That will matter if those 55B's are double-sided drives (I can't recall - are
they?)

Not to worry... you should be running soon. Oh; and are they used or ??

  THEY ACCESS PART OF A DIRECTORY THROUGH RSDOS THEN I GET AN I/O ERROR.

     YES , THEY ARE DOUBLE SIDED, THEY ARE USED -BUT THEY WERE WORKING PROPERLY
BEFORE I TOOK THEM OUT OF THE OLD MACHINE(TELEVIDIO 802),NO
     I DID NOTICE, HOWEVER ,THAT THERE IS A PLACE FOR A RESISTOR IN ONE OF THE
DATA CHANNELS-COULD THIS BE NEEDED?
  I'VE GOT 2 JUMPERS WITH EACH DRIVE -1 IS SET DRIVE(D0,D1,D2,D3)-THE OTHER ONE
WAS SET ON HM(HM,HS,MX),
 THE ORDER OF ALL OF THEM ARE-
      FROM BACK LEFT-RIGHT
      HS,DS0,DS1,HM,DS2,DS3,MX

Andy - okay, the jumpers sound right.

Yes, usually the last drive on the cable needs the resistor pack installed
(called "termination").  Drives may or may not operate without one.

Check your cable.. do you see any pins pulled on the drive connectors? If so,
being double sided will require that you either make a new cable (by crimping
on new 34-pin connectors from any RS store)... or by turning over the cable at
all ends (so that the "good" side with all pins is used).

Let us know what you find.

Recently started to get more familiar with MultiView and found creating OS9
shells within it to be rather fascinating.  One glitch
I've noticed is that a module in memory can be used by only one window at a
time, such as when playing 2 of Floyd's game in different
windows.  The games require RunB, syscall, inkey, and gfx2.    I'm guessing
that this is normal and that there's no way around it.
Is that true?  -ph-

Eh?  Program modules in OS-9 are essentially without exception re-entrant and
position-independent, precisely so they *can* be used by multiple processes.
Now, a given program module may be written in such a way as to defeat that,
typically by using the same names for files open for output or update, but the
intent of OS-9 is that programs *should* be usable by multiple processes
without loading multiple copies.

Well, maybe the problem is that the process should be started using the icon

Its been a while since I did it, but take a look at env.file in /DD/SYS. I

Hi Paul -

No, modules can be used repeatedly by anyone, as long as there is memory for
the programs to run (and map in the modules).  As long as a game uses windows,
it should be able to run in several of them at once.

You need to give us more info... which game, what kind of errors do you get,
how do you start things, how much ram do you have, etc etc.

thx - kev

I know exactly what the problem is.  It's my fault, not OS9's.  When
programming my games, I called some modules the same.  For example, I might
call the boot modules Dungeon and the main game module Game.  For another game,
say Gem Quest, I would call the boot module GemQuest and the game module Game. 
See the problem?  For some reason it never occured to me that someone would
want to run the games at once!  When I have time I'll create a modpatch to take
care of the problems with running the games concurrently.

You'd probably have to explicitly open /w yourself, OPEN #wpath, "/w":UPDATE,

      The J&M has a Konan drive controller board and I've not been using an
mpi. I did some fiddling with the ident and cmp utilities and discovered ( well
it WAS a discovery for me ! ) that cc3disk is longer than ccdisk as is /d0II
longer than /d0I. Why so and could that be a hint of something lacking for
level II operation.
 btw what are the sig surcharge rates for patient tutors of slow
 students...

Don - grin - no extra charge for slow learners who keep at it.

I betcha /d0 is longer in L-II cuz of the name "cc3disk" embedded in it (versus
just "ccdisk").  Am I close?

CC3disk itself is longer because it has more capability than the L-I version.
That is, it knows better about double-sided and 80tk disks, and isn't hardcoded
to everything like CCdisk was.

Good on the Konan controller. I assume you have the AR util?  I can email you
something to play with. best - kev

 I've been fiddling with an as is tent sale  radio shack 15 meg hard drive of
the variety intended for the level 1 drivers packaged in os9 version 2.00
 The price was right ( 75 bucks ) I couldn't resist. I already have the primary
drive and it works well. Got to build my own cables to connect these two
beasties. Inside the humongous case there is a five inch tandon unit with a
western digital control board. No docs came with either unit.
 Got it all fired up today with all the drivers in place and the cables hooked
up properly ( I hope ! ) But no luck
 Any attempt to access /h1 including format results in a two step failure.
     example;  format /h1
               ** all the normal prompts **
               error 247 seek error
               Ok no sweat the drive is trashed but the next
               drive access on /h0 gets an error 246 device not
               ready. Something has happened to the driver !
               /d0 and /d1 behave normally but cchdisk is
               trashed until reboot. I can say with confidence
               that it is NOT /h0.
 Ok so now the question;
  Is that secondary drive /h1 REALLY trashed or is my hookup suspect
  and does anybody have any ideas how narrow it down. Lastly any
  favorite vendors for repair. From 75 bucks theres a lot of room
  to play with and still be cost effective.

Kevin, no I am not using a multipak and yes the drive desc is set to zero. The
drive light does not come on during the accesses when no programs are being
run. I did not realize that some drive autopark themselves after a certain
period of no use. The problem with the boot seems to be with the way in which
the CC3go module interacts with the CCHDisk. Possibly the CCHDISK has a bug in
it.

To: all

I'm conducting a "poll" of the OS9 users here on the sig.

1)  How many of you are still using the ss50/30 or ss50/30c bus?

2)  If you reply in the affirmative to question 1,
    does your system have serial port cards that have the
    capability of selectable baud rate?  If so, did you build the card or
    purchase it from a supplier?

3)  If you do not have such a card, would you be interested in PC boards that
    you could "stuff" using the 6551 ACIA?

The reason for these questions is I'm still using the ss50c bus and use the
6850.  This of course requires external baud rate generators.  I've constructed
prototypes for another system I've built from scratch that uses a 80 pin bus. 
Since it has worked so well, I'm looking for a number of individuals who would
like a 6551 serial port card to help defray the cost of having good PCBs made. 
I am currently laying out the board and will have them made if there is any
interest.

If you are interested, leave a message for me on Mail (I routinely check that
at work).  Let me know how many boards you may want.  If a large enough
interest is shown, we can all benefit from a decent break price per board

Unfortunately, at this time I can only offer the board.  I cannot offer a
driver module.  I'm sure someone out there has already written one.
