BTW, the copy of sgstat.h I have has the RBF stuff in it, without a structure

You can order the service manual from Radio Shack.  I have one and it is pretty
complete, as are all the RS service manuals.  The color convergence procedure
is fairly short, but you need a program to generate a crosshatch pattern. 
Should be simple enough.

I think you are getting confused with Address size Vs. Data path size. I am not
commenting on any particular system architecture only your comment That a 16
bit cpu wont work on a 32 bit buss. I agree the use of a 16bit buss is the
right thing to do. However I think any architecture that removes any of the
addressing from the system bus and makes it CPU access only is basicly flawed.
Besides you should be using some sort of cache controler to make up the
difference.

Ummm. Pretty pointed "PS", Frank.

Isn't that caller's question best answered by KLE, rather than in your own Q&A
file?  Personally, I don't think that either company should upload info about
the other's machine (yet). Even well-meaning answers can be misleading, being
based on changing specifications. So I believe that each company should talk
ONLY about what it knows right now: its own hardware.

I suspect that _both_ companies would benefit from such a policy at this time.
Of course, if each company wishes to release me to talk about the status of
_all_ their pending plans, I'd be than happy to indulge in some fair slicing
through of the hype on both sides, myself <grin>.

In any case, the info I have is this: The MM/1 normally would use a 16-bit bus
with 16-bit peripherals (those can also be used on the 32-bit bus, natch).

There will be a shared-RAM adapter for the two main MM/1 cards to plug into a
larger 32-bit bus... allowing multiple MM/1s to coexist with a 68030, much in
the same way that multiple TC9s coexist with your K-Bus 68030. So the MM/1
isn't "discarded". I guess it would primarily be used as an intelligent
gfx/sound/io device once a 68030 is added.

New Q's: What happens to a person's TC70 when he upgrades to a 68030 on the
K-bus? And what calculations were used to show a 68030 using 16-bit RAM slowed
only 5% over using 32-bit RAM? Or was that only when accessing peripherals?

"Awfully expensive" is, of course, relative.  Seems like I remember that Radio

about 15-30 minutes.  The price in relation to the Mdl 16 was a drop in the
bucket, as I recall, but to a CoCoist it might seem out of reach. It's been too
long ago for me to quote a price, besides, I'm not even sure they carry them

Fm: DENNIS SKALA 73177,2365
To: RODGER ALEXANDER 75366,556

I wouldn't recommend using the B&B interface with the PBJ CCBus.  It was the
death of mine, and the reason I finally broke down and bought an MPI.

First problem is that you need to add the 12 volt DC circuit to the CCBus (or
power the HD interface card with a separate 12 VDC).  Then because the CCBus
doesn't switch the SCS and CTS lines separately, you must use a floppy
controller which is fully decoded to $FF4x, so that it doesn't conflict with
the B&B interface, which is at $FF5x.  This means no Tandy floppy controller,
as well as many others.  Or --- you could fully decode the offending floppy
controller.  I did that, and it's fairly easy.

I don't recall having to patch any software for the sake of the hard disk
interface itself (of course to use the CCBus with OS9, a few system patches
were required for other stuff).

When I put the whole thing together, it worked for about 15 minutes and blew
out the average size wall transformer.  I found the absolutely biggest one of
the proper voltage, rigged a plug to it, and gave it a try.  It held out, but
ran super hot too.  I used this setup for a while until I noticed that the
power supply on the CCBus board was running so hot that it melted the plastic
cover.  The standard PC hard disk interfaces are apparently quite power hungry
At that point I gave up and got the MPI.  A *LOT* more reliable (if physically
more inconvenient).

Give a yell if you need more specific information.

Fm: Kevin Pease 70516,1633
To:  70310,317



        Frank I have been reading the mail on the sidelines for a long time and
not comenting. First the 32 bit bus is something that over the next few years
will become necessary to suport new hardware and graphics standards. The way
this works is the MM/1 uses a 16 bit bus. So the MM/1 is using only half of the
32 bit bus. Eventually 68030's and 68040's will become more popular and the
need for a 32 bit bus will become aparent. Since we have a 32 bit bus defined
as part of the MM/1 specification the people that have bought boards for the
MM/1 will not be stuck with un-usable hardware. It wil plug in and be useable
by the new 32 bit processors. So the 32bit bus definition is so that people
don't have to throw away the boards that they may buy. I have never read the
ads by Paul but they probably should read that the MM/1 bus has been define for
full 32 bit operation. Also the 68040 does not suport dynamic bus sizeing. What
this means is that unless one uses a verry large amount of hardware external to
the processor to simulate the 68030/68020 automatic bus sizeing one can only
access a 16 bit wide device as a word aligned word access or properly aligned
byte access. One can not access the device as a 32 bit device and have the
processor make the two accesses that would be required to assemble the long
word. what this means is that if one has a 16 bit graphics board one could only
use word accesses to move memory around. with instruction execution overhead
the move would be slower than if the device was 32 bits wide. It would take 2
times as long to do the same size move.
        I don't know how you made the calculatins but they are verry
misleading. if one is moveing more than a few bytes of data around the 32 bit
bus will be two times as fast as the 16 bit bus for the same bus access speed.
Example: bus speed is 100 ns. on a 16 bit bus to move 1000 bytes it would take
500 accesses or 50000 ns. The same 1000 bytes would require 250 accesses or
25000 ns. the instruction over head for the two moves would be identical
assuming that the processor had an instruction cache. This explanation is a
little over

simplified but to go into any more depth would require more space than a
message would allow. The actual increase in speed would be somewat less but it
is obvios that there is more than 5% increase in speed. Since a large part of
data processing is moveing data around the 32 bit bus would be superior. Since
these two machines are intended for graphics nad sound manipulation a 32 bit
bus is definately superior and will become aparent when a 32 bit processor is
put on the market.



PS Frank instead of competing with paul and makeing machines that are similar
why don't you distribute the MM/1 much like you distribute the TC70 by
hazlewood. It seems that if you two would join forces it would be much better
for the whole coco comunity.
