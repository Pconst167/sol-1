Phil - as Pete said, an ON ERROR command will catch the Break key... but only
once the program is packed. Otherwise basic09 assumes you're stopping the
program run, which makes sense during testing.

You had to remove the terminating resistor, but you are right, you also need to
jumper it right also. I don't have a 213, I have a 225 and a 21-1, and they
both have a small jumper pad at the back. The come jumpered as drive 0, so I
just moved the jumper on the drive which was going to be /h1 over one position.

Something is still amiss. I did move that jumper over one spot. Played all
evening with different cable settings and jumper settings and whether the
terminating resistor was in /h0 or not. No success. I am beginning to think
that this controller is just what I want. It is a larger WD1002S-WX2. Maybe it
isn't 100% compatable. Only 97.3%.

Fm: Mark Griffith 76070,41
To: JC Hoit 73127,2213 (X)

JC,

On the ST-213 drive there is a set of jumpers located next to the 34 pin edge
card connector.  The two pins (one on top of the other) right next to the
connector should already have a jumper between them.  This sets the drive up as
drive 0.  What you need to do is move that jumper one over to set it up as
drive 1.

As for the terminating resistors, it depends mostly on the controller and drive
combination whether or not any are needed.  About 6 or 7 years ago, most drive
controllers and drives needed one to be there at the end of the "chain". 
Nowadays, most controller/drive combinations really don't care.  The name
"terminating" resistor is misleading, much the same as it is on SCSI busses. 
They're really nothing more than pull-up resistors to insure, get this, that
the logic levels on the lines drop (yes, not rise) to 0.

If you follow the advise that most people give, that you need at least one on
the last drive, you can't go wrong.  I've never seen a situation where having
one caused problems...although I have seen situations where only one didn't
work right and two were needed.

BTW: Since you are going to have two hard drives, you might want to look into
getting my hard disk backup program in DL9.  It works pretty good as an
automatic backup utility from the "main" drive to the second on. If you also
have Pete's CRON utility, you can set it up to automatically do an incremental
backup of your /h0 drive to /h1 in the middle of the night.  It sure is nice to
know all your work is backed up for you.

Hi, Mark. The Miniscribe (/h0) barfs all over the place when I take the
resistor out. And it isn't changing my success one way or the other. I did move
the jumper over one. As I said in the message to Zack, I am suspecting the
controller being a little off beat. I am going to stop wasting my time on this
one and locate one that B&B suggests.

I will definitely try your HD utilities when I get this hardware straightened
out. I spotted it earlier and it looked interesting.

Thanx, JCH

Well..
   Lessee....Jordan is quite a bit farther away (say 25 miles or so) and is
also near a town called Apex. Lake Wheeler though is with 10 minutes of my
house so that is why I thought you were thinking of it.
   Jordan is much nicer for fishing and boating that Lake Wheeler though.

 Yep, it looks like Jordan Lake was the one we spotted.

 We're in Redwood City, about 1.6 mi. from the San Andreas, so as soon as we
can get some foundation work done on our house, we're outta here!  I'd love to
transfer to Raleigh/Chapel Hill - that way I could probably retire at 55 (in
another 7 years).  There's no way around here!  And it's gonna get much worse
in the next few years.  It takes me an hour each way to get to work every day
even now!

  NC looks like a great place to live (even without all the forum members that
live there :-) , but that's a bonus).  We hope to get out and explore this
summer if my current project ever catches up to it's time line and I get to
take my vacation.  We'll see!

with figuring out how to get it to run from my hard drive.  It appears it needs
some patching.  Are you familiar with this game as well?  I've got "ded" to
patch with.   On "sub' its got a /d0 which I've tried changing to /h0 with ded
but there seems to be more the needs to be done.  I guess it needs to be run
from a VGF screen right? thanks Craig

~ Craig;

  There's a file called GAMES.PAT in one of the libs with Kev's PPN on it that
tells how to run it (assuming you're talking about EPYX's Sub Battle).

  Basically, the file just says to use the commands from side 2 and ignore t2e
ones from side 1.

  Here's an edited script that I use for starting most of the games on my HD:

Actually, I hope that we can prove you wrong here! Signetics (the manufacturer
of our CPU) is very agressive in its OEM pricing for its 68070. Plus, the GNU C
compiler has reportedly just been ported to OSK. We are evaluating the
possibility of offering this excellent public domain C compiler at cost. Of
course, we also need to look at just how solid the port is, and then justify
the person-hours involved in fulfulling sales.

So you may just be seeing a nice mid-priced computer system that blows away
most other systems, and with a pd C compiler that can match features with the
best!

I guess the question is--how Unix-like is it?  It may have changed in the five
years since I actually saw anything about it, but from what I did see back
then, UniFlex looked different enough from Unix that the Unix-worshippers would
turn their noses up at it.

By now you may have already seen the BITNET messages saying something like
"MINIX?!? Are you crazy?"  MINIX is good for what it was intended for, i.e. a
pedagogical tool, but aside from that...I've yet to hear from anyone using it
in a production environment.

It's safe to assume that anything that says "Unix-like" usually refers to the
file system.  From there it get's pretty different from the real thing. UniFlex
is no different than Unix in its file system (ie, Inodes, etc) but it has so
many differences as to be also MS-DOS-like, OS-9-like, or "you name it -like". 
"Unix-like" is a sales tool, which means nothing really.

Good points, both -- UNIFlex is actually very MUCH like UNIX now.

Also, MINIX is in demand at universities for pedagogy, as you mention, and to
SELL MINIX is easier than to SELL OS-9.

However, one of the main reasons that other OSes are being considered is that
many purchasers may simply need a choice -- whether or not they actually USE
two or more operating systems on the same computer is up to them.

Personally, I would push OS-9 on them by tailoring it to their needs. OS-9 can
be made to look much more UNIX-y than it does now.

That's true--and as Feds start writing POSIX into their RFPs, there will be
quite a bit of incentive to make it look like Unix.

May not be necessary. Just buy an MM/1 as a remote terminal. Won't need a local
floppy, just the boards, a portable case, the MM/1 CPU board, and for about the
price of an Amiga 1000, you've got a topnotch graphics terminal especially with
a client/server windowing system.

Well... yeah, that occurred to me right after I left the message. You must mean
an A500, tho, since CBM has (yet again :) discontinued the A1000... Got the
'grand tour' of Microware today... some of it was pretty impressive... Some of
it was d*mned impressive :). James Jones (my tour guide <grin>) showed me this
nifty little Sharp 68000 import running OS/9 68000 v2.2. While the windowing
system looked very impressive, it appeared to have one or two features I didn't
care for (auto-window-to-front, for example)... I only mention that becuase it
gives me an excuse to suggest that you/kevin let me take a lookit the gui for
the Millenium before its released (even a GIF pic, if I don't have one by
then). A book James gave me ("OS/9 Sourcebook"), lists a bunch of software
titles for OS/9... unfortunately, I didn't see, in a brief look-see, any
graphics oriented or entertainment oriented titles (other than some GKS
stuff)... That's where I plan on concentrating my area of development,
regardless of what OS I use...          --Eet--

Mike I was thrilled when I found outI could strap on a terminal on my serial
port and have a multi-user system. I really did it just to see what it was
like, I don't have a need for a multi-user environment, but I like to to the PC
people, and MAC peopleI work with. The only problem I had (I used a WYSE 50
terminal) when I hooked up the terminal was that when I typed a cr and certain
other characters, my shell locked up. I tried emulating (thorugh the terminal
only) all the different types of terms the WY-50 could, and some were worse
than others. But It was

an interesting experience. Multi-user, multi-tasking on a computer that is just
a little over o foot long, and costs $128-$200. That aint no TRASH-80 ! Can't
wait for the MM1, and this new version of OS9 for the coco3. I'll be bragging
like theres no tomorrow. There are several people I work with (all software
engineers) that want to see my coco3 system now. But I am trying to hold off
and wait for the new os-9 package, so It will really blow there socks off.

Looks like you sent the message to the wrong guy. You can direct all the New
Computer messages to me.

The MM/1 will be available late summer -- I mean, we will actually be shipping
in quantitiy.

The list of features you received is a wish list, but it is also a list of the
features that the computer actually has!

I have one MM/1 here on my desk, another one in the living room, and there are
others sprinkled around the US.

We have some small design changes to make, some production costs to deal with,
and software licenses to finish up. Then we can announce an official "street
price".

BTW, we have folks here in Washington who want to put the MM/1 in a hightech
showcase full of advanced multimedia computers.

Chances are slime they'll want the TC-9 for anything at all, even if they COULD
get their hands on one, which they can't.

Paul

PS. I don't mean to sound down on the TC-9. THe MM/1 is just plain better and
is the only choice that will keep our community together for the next five
years or more.

You should make a list of what you want to get on the TC-9, then ask FHL how
much they'll charge you.

Can't have two files in the same directory with the same name...you'll have to
do one of two things:

1. create the new file with a different name, and delete the original and
   rename the new one when the smoke clears.

2. (works ONLY in cases like this, where the output is guaranteed no longer
   than the input)  have *two* paths open to the same file, one for input
   and one for output, and update the file in place.  (of course, only works
   on disks, too!)

As a fatter of mact, I wrote a LF-wiper that took option 2 (avoids fancy
delete/rename footwork).  (Of course, you'll need to set the file size at the
end, so keep track of how many bytes you write, or alternatively, count how
much you delete and subtract that from the file length, giving a new file
length to set!)  I may have uploaded the silly thing.

(Sad to say, I had to be prodded about option 2 as well--I raise the cola can
to Peter Dibble in salute!)

True--but you'd at least have to count the number of characters you deleted,

For a long time now, I've simply formatted floppies when I cranked up the
system, or sometimes killed off a few shells until I could do a format. But
that's rare, because I mostly use the ramdisk and harddisk.

The extra 512K, while not helping with the format thing, does allow you to open
far more gfx windows and preload LOTS of program modules... besides having a
nice-sized ramdisk if you wish. This makes everything flow a lot easier. best -

My goal is to create several windows before MV starts up, and be able to jump

matter to me) just so I can see them being created, and then jump into my  MV

I'm not really the guy to ask on this one, I use MultiVue very little. When I
do, I just let it start up off the disk, iniz windows as I use them.

On my LII system disk, I start up /term, /w1, /w2. This is all I ever use, so I
don't use up memory by keeping the other discriptors in memory. For them I just
use the "wcreate"

     wcreate /w1 -s=7 0 0 80 24 9 1 1

Or what ever, then shell i=/w1&. From what I understand, iniz should do about
the same thing, except give you the default windows.

You should maybe ask Kevin Darling, or Pete Lyall about this, I do a little
hacking, and patching, but let guys like them tell me what to do.

You need to do a DWSet to get your windows up and running.  Try:

 iniz w1
 display 1b 20 7 0 0 50 18 0 1 1 >/w1
 shell i=/w1&

Do not try to select the new window in the startup file as this will cause the
procedure to hang.  I think this is because the select causes the original
shell to loose the input file when standard input is reset to the keyboard of
the new window

Bruce,

We are trying (have been for a few years now) to get users to not iniz devices
using Level II, especially windows.  The reason is if they later close the
window (stop all processes running on it) and they don't deiniz it, the memory
for that window is kept by the system.  This could cause some real debugging
headaches later on if they run out of memory.

In your example (shown below):

 iniz w1
 display 1b 20 7 0 0 50 18 0 1 1 >/w1
 shell i=/w1&

the user is stuck with an immortal shell on /w1 and the window memory is locked
in until they specifically kill the shell and deiniz the window device. Your
example is fine tho, in that to send the display codes to the window and have
them "take", it either has to be iniz'ed or a path has to be opened to that
device.  A better way would be something like this:

 (display 1b 20 2 0 0 50 18 0 2 2;ex shell)<>>>/w&

This command starts a shell on the next available window, does the DWSET, and
then starts another shell.  Once the second shell is started, the first one
dies.  So, a path is be opened on the device the whole time and the DWSET
works.  As an added bonus, when the shell on that window dies, the window goes
away and the memory is returned.

If you wanted to, you can set this command line up in your execution directory
and call it "window" or something like that.  Then all you need to do is enter
that command and the window is created.  You can also do this to create
different types of windows, and call the commands "g80" or "g40" to make 80 and
40 columns graphics windows.

Good point about the iniz.  If the window is iniz'd when you direct output to
it anyway, there's no need to do it explicitly.  Tony was trying to set up a
shell in a window from the MV startup file so an immortal shell is appropriate
I think.  Personally, I've set up an AIF to call up a shell in an 80 col
window.  That way I'm not locked into having a shell up if I don't need it.

While we're on the subject of deiniz, do you have any idea why it's so hard to
get rid of a ram disk (the one from the developement pac)?  It usually takes a
number of deiniz's to get the memory back.  To ease things I call a procedure
file having around 10 deiniz's.  This does the job but occassionally will cause
the system to hang.

Bruce - each time you use "/r0" in a pathname the "User Count" (see  output of
the DDir utility) goes up. A deiniz takes it down by one, so you gotta do it
until you hit zero users. Oops. dinnertime. later- kev

Bruce - no. Link count is what you see with an Mdir. That's the count of links
to a module.

The user count shown in Ddir (or Devs, if under OSK), is the count of "users"
of a particular device. It goes up when a file is opened, down when a file is
closed. However, at least under L-II it only goes upward (never down) when you
do a CHD or CHX using a device's name.

This count is used to figure out when a device's init/terminate routines should
be called (that is, on first use, and when last use ends).

The "iniz" and "deiniz" commands artificially inc/dec this count, just as
"link" and "unlink" do for modules.

Bruce,

You could do an immortal shell in the command line example I gave also. I
think, tho, that you would have to redirect the output to standard out since
you can't explicitly give the window device name.  Something like ";ex shell
i=/2"??  I never tried it.

On unlinking the ramdisk....Kevin gave you the reason.  There is a utility
floating around someplace in the data libraries called "unload".  All it does
is repeatedly call unlink until an error occurs.  This effectively unlinks any
module in memory, no matter how many link counts there are.

I don't know which version of DS/DF you're using ... I use an early version
that was unbelieveably enough done in interpreted Pascal.

A few prelim questions first?

o - Does the printer work other than with DF?

o - Has DF ever worked?

o - Are you running one of the newer versions of DS/DF (written in C)?

o - What else are you running at the same time?

I am in the process of designing a small embedded system and was interested in
using OS-9 on a 68000 microprocessor.  I have some implementation questions for
those of you out there with considerable experience with OS-9.

1.  What are the memory requirements for running OS-9 on a 68000?  (i.e. Will
it fit in 64K, 32K, what?)

2.  I was planning on using a Sun 3/80 for developement, is this OK?

3.  How about a brief description of OS-9 with regards to multitasking,
interprocess communications, device driver implementation, etc.  This software
will have to interface to some analog and digital sensors and some
communications equipment (i.e. modems, terminals)

I have developed many embedded systems from 8 bit processors programmed with
assembly and FORTH, to VMEbus computers running various realtime kernels, but I
have yet to venture into the OS-9 arena.  Any help on any or all of these
questions will be greatly appreciated.

A Sun 3 for development?  Should be OK as far as I know--there are tools for
debugging code from a Unix system across Ethernet on an OS-9/68K system, even.

Probably the best thing to do for a brief description would be to call up
Microware (515-224-1929, 9-5 on weekdays) and ask for a copy of the *OS-9
Catalog*, which gives an overview of the operating system.  I think that
they'll send you a copy for free.

Hi Charles. From a Microware file I got a while back...

The Host system for porting may be:
 a. A 68000-based computer with 256K RAM and OS-9/68000.
 b. A VAX computer running UNIX/BSD 4.2 or VMS.
 c. A SUN 3 Workstation running UNIX/BSD 4.2.

The Target (embedded) system requires:
 a. A 68000 family CPU.
 b. At least 64K RAM.
 c. At least 16K ROM capacity.  Alternatively,
    use an emulator with 16K of overlay memory.
 d. Two serial I/O ports; one for a terminal and
    one for communications with the host system.

I think once you get it ported over, you can drop back the RAM. At the same
time, the ROM will need to go up to around 32K, as now you'll burn in the whole
OS (original ROM holds a debugger to help porting). You can also drop the
serial ports, of course. Hmmm. You can get by with (1) during porting, I think
also. I could be far off here. Anyway, as you go along you can ROM each
application, and OS-9 will find it automatically on the next restart (or you
can load into RAM on the fly, of course).

Wait. Let me look on my system: kernel is 25K; a serial port manager and driver
maybe 4K total. System RAM use maybe 8-12K on startup? That doesn't count any
shells or apps or more drivers, of course. OS-9 may be slightly larger than
other realtime kernels, because it's a more full-fledged OS. You could easily
switch to doing development on your target if you wished (and added some mass
storage).

For far better and later details, call Microware at 515-224-1929. And, if you
wish, do a "GO MSC" here on CIS and download the files on OS-9 from the
Microware Systems Corp (msc) display area. Loads of info there. You'll find
stuff on IPC, multitasking, etc. Drivers are pretty easy to write. Be sure to
also read their "Pipelines" newsletter there.

Judging from what I've been told by others with your same background, you'll
enjoy working with OS-9 quite a bit. best - Kevin

Frank - From Phil Brown on bitnet: Would you please forward  this query to
frank?

Frank: I just read your Advertisement in the June issue of Rainbow, for the
Tomcat.  I was quite impressed, and glad you took a full-page .  But, as they
say, with the answers to questions come more questions.  I have pulled out
various issues, that I have tried to keep directly related to the Ad.  You may
want to break up your reply into 2 or more separate replies.

For the K-Bus system of OSk: I have heard that the K-bus is only 16-bit.  Is
this true, and if so, have you any plans to change this?

(Since osk is advertised with the K-bus) Does your $300 OSk package come with
the C comopiler?  How much for it separately?

And mainly for the Tomcat/TC9 : It was said that the TC9 is "K-bus compatible".
Does that mean that it is possible to add on a K-bus, or does one come with it?
(aside:  How about 1.2/1.4 Meg flopies?)

You stated that the TC9 could use a 68000 board as a co-processor.  Would that
be in some ways automatic, or is it up to us to make our programs take
advantage of this?

Similarly, What configurations are possible?  TC9 and TWO 68000 boards? TC9 and
perhaps a CoCoIII? Would TC9 and a 68030 be better than TC9 + 68000? Since a
68000 can use TC9 as a slave board, can a 68030 use a 68000 board? If you can
have multiple TC9s, how about multiple 68000 boards?

You said that the joystick res has been increased to 256.  How will this affect
a high-res joystick interface?  Is there any way to get 640 by XXX  joystick
res WITHOUT using a hi-res interface? Will it be possible to use a logitech, or
optical, "digital" mouse, under OS9? (since it will have "real" serial ports
now)

How about no-halt disk operations, under OS9, without a 68000 board?

You mentioned that under OSk, with the 68000 board as main CPU, the TC9 would
be "a multi-function graphics co-processor".  You didn't mention anything about
the graphics board I have heard about here! Does the TC9 have increased res.
over the CoCo III?

Ok. I've made the change. A lot of people have been telling me to change to

borrowing another rs232 pak now, so I t doesn't look like that is the problem.
My MPI is modified. I am using a 1200 baud radio shack modem . I did notice
that the 2 bbs's that I had problems dialing used 7 bit data, and the long
distance bbs used 8 bit. Can a modem be sensitive to certain phone #'s. It
seems like the only thing it can be is the modem. ANny ideas ?

Tony,

Yes, you're right about using the </1, because a script file's standard input
is the script file itself. Selecting a new window won't work unless standard
input is reset to be a window... which is what the </1 does. Using our secret
decoder ring, we translate the "</1" as:

 "<"    - redirect standard input for the command...
 "/1"   - using whatever is now standard output
          (usually the window you're on now)

BTW, note that command lines are parsed from left to right. So the line
"display 1b21 >/w7 </1" wouldn't work. Can you see why? Popquiz Monday ;-).

You say that you want to have other windows started up other than Gshell. I
assume that you've had no problem starting up these other windows and shells,
but now (just to be fancy) want to see these new windows get started? Here's an
example method of doing that:

 iniz w7 w8
 display 1b21 </1  >/w7; echo WINDOW SEVEN >/w7
 display 1b21 </w7 >/w8; echo WINDOW EIGHT >/w8
 display 1b21 </w8
 t
 * NOW STARTING BACKGROUND PROCS
 shell i=/w7&
 mdir >/w8&

Notes:
 1. After you Select another window, you have to make it your std input in
order to cause another Select to take.
 2. You can't have a program waiting on input from the Window you're Selecting
or DeSelecting. Unless you want to wait your turn at input of course... and
that's one reason your script might hang. So start programs last.
 3. Your descriptors had better have been Wmode'd (WMODE.AR Lib 10) to default
as separate windows, or you'll hang. Term, W1, W4 and W7 come that way stock.
Or use wcreate or DWSET (1b20 etc etc) to set the window type on the fly).

Keep asking until things get clearer. Glad to help if possible! - kev

The rs232 pak _requires_ Data Set Ready (DSR), Data Carrier Detect (DCD) and
Clear to send (CTS) lines to be held high. This can be accomplished in
different ways. If your modem is capable ...that's the easiest. Investigate the
&C and &D commands.

Another way would be to jumper line 6-8-20 together. Either will generally

I downloaded WizPro and I love it.  I will soon write for the unabridged

your standard ProAcia. He is not planning to use a multipak because he is
installing his CoCo in an IBM case.  He also has a 4 in 1 board.

After making a new bootdisk with Proans.bin substituted, WizPro would run but
not communicate with the modem (with no multipak), and would not run WizPro at
all with the multipak.

Did I download the wrong program or make some other mistake.  I don't have the

Hmmmm. I am not familiar with Proans.bin. That may be for the Eliminator??? To
use the supercontroller II all you need to do is patch MWP so that the address
for the port is FF54 instead of FF68. With modpatch you just change byte 10
from 68 to 54. On the reupload of pro, I just put it into two files vice 3. Let
me know if you need more help. -BB

Fm: David George 72240,134
To: ALL

There seems to be a small problem with fseek() in the Kreider library.
I am using fseek(fp, --p, 2); to position the file pointer at the end
of a file and then back up character by character.                      

I am using this in my TAIL program (which works like the UNIX version).
With the Kreider C library I get too many lines.  When I ask for 10 it
gives me about 20 (not exactly, and it is different for different files).
However when I compile it on my Atari running Professional OS9 it works
fine.  Also when I compile it with the standard CLIB.L on the Coco it      
works.

Also is there any news on the 68K version of the Kreider library.  I
especially need the password functions for SU and CHOWN.

Is the variable "p" initilized as a LONG?

I use the exact same code in the version of TAIL that I wrote and it works just
dandy.

Yes I have p as long  ( long p = 0L; )

Did you compile your version of TAIL with the Kreider Clib.l or Microware.
I only have the problem with the Kreider Clib

Interesting problem. I also have a small problem like that in my 'more'

Try dropping a note directly to Carl on this... (71076,76). Also, I'll have a

Your message came out 'helped' by the CIS message formatter.... To save a

Phil - I assume the program is packed when you run it. An error 2 or 3 could
occur at any time while the program is running, but even so, I see no reason
why the overlays wouldn't work right....

Well ok, yes. If you had an extra overlay open and hit BREAK, then your error
routine needs to go back to the right spot. That's not easy to do, so how about
this: keep a variable which you pass around called "overlaycount" or something.
Maybe the error routine or your main routine could keep track that way?

A 'shar' is just an ascii file... it's a SHELL ARCHIVE that contains both the
script and data files to unpack itself. If you  had a Unix bourne shell, you'd
just unpack it by doing a:

   /bin/sh <filename>

The .shz suffix makes me wonder.... there IS no standard suffix for a SHAR
file. Also, the 'z' is usually tacked onto something that's been 'compress'ed.

Try uncompressing it first (use a compress -d), and then see if it's ASCII.
Then try the SHAR tool.

P.S. The UNSHAR I have occasionally crashes... dunno if they're the same.

P.S. Our (os9/6809) compress will only handle 12bit compression... typical

Information Systems, Fault Tolerant Computing, Technical Writing, and more.

Plus free magazines to callers.

What I'm wondering is if people would call this BBS - I'm studying the
conference and course registration market and see a tremendous slump in
registration.

What is going on out there - why aren't people registering for conferences? Are
corporations not funding this anymore?  Would you be someone who would call in
for info?   Or would you rather request info by easyplex?

  I seem to be having a small problem with the fseek() call in your library.
When I use fseek(fp, --p, 2) to postion the pointer at the end of a file
and read backwards it (fseek) go back to far.  This is for the TAIL program.
I have compiled successfully on both my Atari with Professional OS9 and with
