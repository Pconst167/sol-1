Randy - if I'm going to be gone for more than a couple of days, I always resign
from the list, and sign back up when i return. But I'd ask the list about it,
as they may have implemented some form of protection lately. Maybe not.
Sometimes there are 20 msgs a day, and since your mailbox can only hold 50, two
days or so unattended will cause problems.

I have a thought tho. Maybe someone could AR up each week's mail and post it
here? Maybe two files, swapped every other week, or something. Hafta think
about it.

Kevin,

One other option is to request the latest weekly message archive file from the
list. Mosts lists maintain files, on a weekly basis, of all messages posted to
the list. It means you'd be a week or so behind, and requires sending a request
for the file each week, but would cut down on the number of messages. Now that
the CompuServe Mail file size limit is fairly large (not sure of exactly how
big) a weeks worth of messages shouldn't go past any file size limitations.

50 is the magic number of messages the Mailbox will hold before barfing. And
that's 50 messages regardless of size (so long as yu don't exceed the size
limits of 50K on ASCII or 512K on binaries).

Kind of neat thinking you can have 50 512K binary files waiting for you when

Yeah .... don't. :-)

You'll risk the wrath of the list. The traffic has, at times, been heavy enough
that a CIS mailbox will fill to overflowing in about 2 days. At that point,
mail will start to bounce back to the list ... and to every other members's
mailbox. Not something you'd want your name associated with.

If you're gonna be unable to check in at least every other day, I'd
unsubscribe. You can pick up what you've missed (if you like) from the

I can't really recommend any one particular modem. My experience has been with
a very inexpensive 2400 modem (Supra) that works, but is a little flakey, and
with one of the older US Robotics Courier modems that is rock solid (but was
almost $400). Bruce is right, though, avoid the really cheap ones, so plan to
spend at least $150. DO NOT buy the US Robotics modem that is around $150, I
have had nothing but trouble with two different versions of that model at work.
Also Hayes modems seem to be overpriced.

Well, the best response here is no response. I WILL say that UniFlex is
interested and that we talk.

Kenneth-Leigh Enterprises and Interactive Media Systems have spent tens of
thousands of dollars already. We will spend half a million before the year is
out. That means that our choice of the operating system depends on two factors:
timing, and what our markets need. UniFlex is EXTREMELY UNIX-like, even more so
than OS-9. THis is sure to win over our education market, although OS9 could be
made to work nicely, too. Also, UniFlex is real-time, making it logical for the
data acquisition folks.

Of course, I want OS-9 on the MM/1, too. But timing and the market drive us.
We'll use a system that makes sense for the market, and work with the company
that makes sense to us.

BTW, you didn't mention that Minix may soon be available on the MM/1? Not that

Part of that message got garbled -- strangeness at CIS!  What was not printed
was: OS-9 could also do extremely well in the education market, although I
think it would be a somewhat harder sell. Also, with UniFlex being real-time,
the data acquisition folks that we have targeted could do their work nicely.

Over the years, UniFLex has kept up with changes in Unix, even to the point
that they are FIPS (Federal Processing Standard) compatible and have NFS and so
on. Very nice.

Still, Microware seems to be getting some good stuff over, too.

I don't want to give anyone the impression that Microware is being excluded.
Just that we are committing ourselves to the OS vendor that commits to us -and
we have a good relationship with Microware and UniFlex.

Thanks for the address -- I'll need to check to see if you were on the list for
the second mailing (going out this week). The first mailing went out around the
Fest (over 800 pieces) and this one is at least as big. We've had a really
tough time keeping up with the demand.

About OS-9 on the MM/1 -- by no means are we excluding it.

Remember what happened to us with Tandy -- we were dealing with a company that
seemed mute.

Microware and UniFLex (one more than the other) have been communicating with us
well, making us hopeful that if one or both operating systems is included we as
a community will have a forthcoming and involved OS vendor to by (oops, "be") a
partner.

Does that make sense to you?

(not standing up for UN*X, mind you, I'm a VMS person at work, and an OS9er at

to be anything you like. And UN*X does emply command line parameters and
switches just like OS9 does. First thing I did when we got an Ultrix (DEC's
flavor of UNIX) box was to go set up personal aliass for all the common
commands to be like VMS!

Colin,

The current plan is to include a high level language in the base case system,
and to include ANOTHER high level language in the second board package, making
a full system come with TWO languages.

Plus, we will be selling a language currently selling extremely well on MS-DOS
machines.

Pricing?  Will let you know the REAL price in about a month. We have found that
certain items are costing less, others more.

We want to find a price that gives you guys a break but also allows us to hire
FULL TIME PROGRAMMERS to crank out cool stuff.

Incidentally, we already have several people from Atari, Amiga, and PC domains
itching to get a system.

Looks like the application support, esp. on the multimedia side, will be
outrageous.

I hate UNIX too, because it has made itself inconsistent and quirky at the
Shell level which is where I spend most of my time. I am sorry, but I like the
OS-9 convention of keeping executables together, instead of littering them all
about. I mean, why have /usr, /bin, /misc, and so on?

But I'm just being a stick in the mud. UNIX will be on five times as many
desktops in two years as it is now. And if you look into Personal Computing
Magazine this month, you'll see that MS-DOS is going LOSE about 20% market
share.

Looks like Tandy dropped the CoCo just in time to devote itself entirely to a
fading market! <grin>

What about Rexx? I'm not familiar (yet) with OS/9, but I think it'd be A Very,
Very, Good Thing to have an implementation of Rexx available for the MM/1
(maybe talk with William Hawes?). It's a fairly high-level language, and since
the MM/1 _is_ multiuser and multitasking, having it on the machine from the
git-go would give yet another slight 'edge' (plus, there are a lot of ARexx
scripts out there already that I'm sure could be adapted quickly and easily.)
You said something about hiring FULL TIME PROGRAMMERS to crank out cool

Is UniFlex any better at real-time work than OSK? Microware has always praised

Not better, but designed differently.  RT OSK designs can be put together
without a disk, while UniFlex needs a Hard Disk.  It swaps processes to memory
and/or the hard disk.  OSK just uses RAM and doesn't swap.  This can be a plus
in many applications.  My old UniFlex always swaps.  Even if I have enough
memory.  It's basically just running procs in a 512Kb max space, and using the
rest of memory (1.5meg) as the swap device (software memory management). 
Equipped with a 68030 you can run virtual memory and forget all that garbage. 
I want to port Minix to mine and get basically the system that OSK uses - out
of memory? tough!  The C compiler/Assembler are very good on the UniFlex
machine.  I documented a couple of bugs, but they are easy to work around.  One
feature it says I'm supposed to have is a Unix switch on the C compiler.  As it
is UniFlex uses a CR rather than a LF, and that messes alot of stuff up.  The
switch doesn't work though (the required library is probably an option $$). 
The other thing I hate is that it uses a '+' for command line options, rather
than a '-' like normal.  This causes you to have to use the shift key to get
at.  It's probably cheaper to buy a 386 with 'real' Unix than get UniFlex
software by itself.  It's very expensive with the RT and Virtual Mem options. 
Unless they had a big price reduction.

Except it's like OSK, not UNIX, in using CR instead of LF. As to price, Paul is

Mike,

TSC changed its name to UniFlex fairly recently. They actually sell pretty well
nowadays, and their real-time response is quite good, certainly adequate for
our targets.

Flex was the OS that Tandy was considering along with OS-9 for the 6809.

Flex lost out because they were -- at that time -- unwilling to do the port to
the Color Computer.  I guess they learn lessons!

BTW, I am still big on Microware. They are busy because they have a very fine
product.

And I am negotiating (on the side) a deal with a DC beltway bandit to sell LOTS
of copies of OS-9 and OS-9000 in a telemetry system that integrates an AMD29K,
68030,a dn 80386!

Weird setup, but each chip is actually being used for what it does best.

Glad to hear Microware is still in the running, whew! So Flex and Uniflex are
from the same outfit.  Ya know Frank Hogg used to be a big Flex dealer, and
phased over to OS9. Nice to know some beltway bandit got a '386 to do something
besides spreadsheets, or whatever PClones are used for, grin.

As a user/developer of os/9 communications software that runs on VME slaves,
let me vote for an o.s. that does not require an attached mass storage device.
If you require that (as people here have said UniFlex does), you lock yourself
out of imbedded systems where a *lot* of the data acquisition work is done.
FWIW.

No problem.

You might want to look at all the official literature coming out of
Kenneth-Leigh Enterprises -- notice that there is no mention of OS-9!

That's not to say (once again) that we won't HAVE OS-9 -- just that the OS
that's bundled with the system will be determined by timing and by what the
market needs (low cost, powerful multitasking, UNIX-style).

And, once again, we have good relations with the OS vendors mentioned.

There are two customers of mine that use CoCos in unique applications. One
customer works at an internationally famous PR firm, where he uses the CoCo on
a TV monitor so that his Big BUck clients can keep track of which audio/video

The other client uses the CoCo 3 and Basic09 to produce printing quotes very

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

Okay, time for my next "innocent 'C' question".

I would like to initialize an array of pointers so that each pointer points to
an array of values. For example, I can get the correct results by doing;

    char data[][3]={
       {1,2,3},
       {.....}

But this seems to be wasteful if the data are all constants. There is no need
for it to be transfered from the program area to the data area. I thought I
could do something like

    char *data[][4]={}

But of course, this sets up a double array of pointers. Not what I want. I
simply want a pointer to data[0][0], a second pointer to data[1][0], etc. Heck,
I'd even settle for a single dimensioned array with a pointer pointing to the
start of the whole mess. What I can't figure is how to define the data. It can
be done with strings...but what about values?

If I understand you correctly, what you're trying to do is set up a large look
up table of constants and you don't want to waste run time and/or memory by
setting it up in data memory.  One way to do this is to employ a stand alone
data module which you access via modlink().  This requires a separate program
to generate the memory module which you then merge with your object program.  I
uploaded a file, DATGEN.AR, to LIB 3 a few months back showing how this can be
done.  Have a look at this file and see if you can apply it to your problem.

Bruce,

Yes, you're right on in what I am trying to do. I had considered data modules
before, but with the richness of C it seemed that there had to a simpler way.
After all,

    char *foo="this is text"

does NOT force "this is a text" to the data area. All I need to do is to
substitute integer values for the string. But how?

BTW, I want to use this data to intialize some GET/PUT buffers. I guess another
way to do it would be to have the data in a file and send that to the buffers,
but having it all in the program makes things nice and clean. I got your datgen
file. I've not had a change to digest it yet, but it seems quite useful. You do
mention somewhere that data modules should be treated as ROM. Hmmm? I recall in
"The Rainbow OS9 ...." that they used data modules to store variable data.
Also, they can be used for interprocess communication. Don't really see why
not. Comments?

String literals are the only type of data that are left in the program area. I
believe the ANSI enhancement of C adds the specifier 'const' which would allow
other types of data to be handled in that way.  With standard C everything is
copied into the data area.

Reading the data in from a disk file has much to say for it.  If all you're
doing is plugging it once into GP buffers there's no reason to have a second
copy of the data in memory at all.  The down side is that you always have to
worry that the data file is where the program expects it to be. It is cleaner
to have it loaded in along with the program.  If you have enough memory left
over in your last 8K block of program memory for a data module then you don't
even waste any memory.

You can use a data module as variable memory as you described.  You just have
to be sure to update the module's CRC if you want OS9 to link to it again.  In
my opinion, however, this is bad practice since modifying a data module makes
the program non-reentrant.  Say a program modifies a data module and you then
go to another window and start the same program as a second process.  If the
first process didn't update the CRC, the second process can't link to the data
module.  If the CRC has been updated, the second process begins with a modified
data module rather than with it de-novo.  If both processes continue to modify
the data module to their own ends chaos can ensue.

Once a module has been loaded, the CRC isn't checked again. So the only time
you'd have to update the CRC would be just before saving out the data module
(or before loading it from disk again)... if such need arises.

Just wanted to throw that in, in case it changes your approach to using data
modules. - kev

Kevin,
     The CRC is checked if a program requests a link to the module as with a C
modlink() call.  This would occur if a second incarnation of the program were
started up as a new process.

William,

Right now, it seems you should go with a VME system. It's an industry standard
that has a wide variety of outstanding add-on cards.  If you cannot afford it,
and can roll your own stuff, you might try using the parallel port on an
Ultrascience PC add-on card.

These are 68000-based systems that fit in a PC.

Soon, my company is porting OSK to a 68030 board from Definicon that also fits
in a PC.

For other options, leave me email

Thanks.

The VME stuff is awful expensive, I suggest that you check in to the G-64/96

allowing you to easily configure a system to your needs.  Call and ask for a

if this is incorrect use directory assistance I seem to remember them changing

I'd also suggest calling Microware and asking for a copy of their latest

Hi kevin,

No, I'm not using the level 1 basic09, I didn't start using os-9 until LII came
along. But I still can appreciate all the work that you and the others have put
in to make os-9 a better environment. I can't imagine what using os-9 without
windows (/term only, and 32 characters at that) would be like. Talk about an
upgrade ! If I don't think I am running out of memory because when I installed
it on my friends' system, we started it up just like the  .doc file said to.
The only  difference between our systems )as far as I can remember) is that I
have a Disto 512k ramdisk and clock and printer card. My friend is using a B&B
host adapter and cllock. I also have the (original lock up prone) B&B host
adapter. Down on the software level, that means I have a different desciptor
and drive for my printer and clock, but I really don't think that has anything
to do with my problem. My system has had a number of wierd unexplainable
problems that fade in and out. I tried resolving them to a software problem
because it only happened under os9. But one problem finally showed up under
rsdos. Anyway I am in the process of re-flowing all the solder joints on that
cc3. I bought a new one last week since they were on sale foe $129 (still too
high), and Tandy said they would be dropping the cocos. This one doesn't have
the sparklie problem !

Speeking of the sparklie problem, when you install the disto 1 meg board, do
you actually get more SYSTEM memory as well. Several times I have run out of
memory, but by using smap pmap and some other programs, it looked as I was out
of system space, not user memory. Do the patches to os9 for the upgrade take
care of this ?


By the way, when can we expect to see the new os9 for the coco 3 ????


See ya soon.

I received the flyer from your group regarding the new computer, it seemed to
me that it wasn't a finalized design, but a wish list. Also there was not any
price or availability mentioned. I also have just received a flyer from the
competition on their  new intro to the os-9 market, the TC9. Now they have
described how expandable it it is and how you could add a 68 this and a 16 MHZ
that. But they did list a price for the TC9 at $299. But I could did not really
say what ALL was on the board. Are we paying $299 for a coco3 ? with a KBUS
connector with a Parallel port and 2 serial ports or what? Regardless, I am
exited that there ARE TWO logical upgrades for the coco3 (I hope Tandy
regretthere decision) and am anticipating more news for both of them. I wish
both parties the best of luck, but frankly the fact that I can plug my coco3
into the os gateway really sways my checkbook heavily (oops). By the way the
worEWAY has been used in IBM mainframe environments as a pseudo windowing
system into different machines / processes. I have a friend who writes
automation software for big blue machines. He  has 3 coco hd systems in his
computer room next to his terminal, where he can dial into work and fix the
problems from home. Well one day he showed me this Gateway that they were using
which allowed him to cut and paste system messages from one process to another
(via Windows) on a TERMINAL !!!!!. It actually has more features, but I can't
remember them. Just wanted to make you aware of the Gateway name, to avoid
possible legal conflicts.

Actually, I like the name OS Gateway. It reminds me of the movie ...........
Millenium.

One thing that I am really interested in is the stereo 8 bit bort for sound
playing and sampling. I have been using Studio Works under rsdos which takes 5
or 6 bit samples (user selectable) through the joystick port. They have also
announced an 8 bit A/D cartridge and new software coming out very soon. Now if
I could only do that under os9. Looks like I can, it's just a matter of time.
Can't wait.


When will your machine be available ?????????????????

Yes, C code can look pretty dense to the novice, especially highly "idiomatic"

C code.  Pascal, on the other hand, is structured COBOL -- for folks who like

While you can fire up a shell on the Amiga serial port, its OS doesn't
currently have record-locking or multiuser permissions. Thus apps which have
several users (say, a BBS or handling several Amigas for a database) usually
just lock out entire files or whole partitions of the hard disk, to prevent
problems.

So no, I wouldn't consider it multiuser, any more than you'd call a CoCo under
RSDOS with one of those remote serial port patches multiuser.

What I hear is that Amiga is NOT multi-user, which gives the MM1 an advantage
-- let your wife do word-crunching on your machine from another room.  Too bad

Mike,

These Atari MIDI folks won't be on board too early, not until a "large enough"
(10,000 +) group of MM/1 owners have the optional MIDI port.

Looking at our stats, that might be a good 18 months. Then give 'em six to 12
months to write their stuff .. so you've got about two years before UltiMusE
will be in the Survival-Of-The-Fittest mode.

Yeah, I noticed on FHL's catalog that, once you buy the Tomcat board and a case
(cheapest one is $180 and I know for a fact you can buy it from Shopper at
$75), you then have to pay Frank $200 to put the thing together.

Now hackers will do the integration themselves, but if Frank thinks that the
hacker market is big enough to keep the CoCo ball rolling, he's got another
thing comin' ...

No, we want the MM/1 to be seen as a cool product for the software hacker, the
consumer, and LATER the hardware hacker.

I gues Frank is charging so much so that he won't get inundated with sales.
After all, he can only sell a few hundred computers before the GIME chip supply
is completely exhausted.

Not to sound down on the Tomcat. I regard Bobo Puppo highly. He is a gentleman
and a fine engineer.  I just think that the MM/1 is the right approach to keep
us together as a community.

But then again, I am prejudiced.

BTW, I am using Sterm on the MM/1 right now! Smooth, great colors on screen, a
real nice system.

      I'm not sure either. Apparently it's becoming popular on PC based BBS's.
I was board bopping and called 201-334-2555 (Hacker's Central) in NJ. The board
hung up early on me and I immediately got this voice phone call- it was an
apology from the sysop. Anyway, we talked for awhile and he mentioned that if I
had a Q-mail reader I could scan the somewhat large message bases very quickly.
It seemed legit to me as I have run into 'Q-mail' on other boards. There was a
weird member application question on this board "Who is the manufacturer of
your CPU?" Since I said 'Motorola'I was asked what operating system I used. The
sysop (Mike) was apparently familiar with this and knew I had a COCO at this
point. Another thing weird is some of the boards I was calling supported 38K
baud over the standard phone lines. I didn't know that was possible.
      Anyway, if no-one here knows how Q-mail works, I will make an effort to
find out.

I think you get much better luck at 1 Meg when you use a newer-version GIME
chip.  I had already upgraded mine, and had no trouble at all with the 1 Meg. 
However, I left my Hemphill 512 board's 100-ohm resistor in parallel with R22,
rather than shorting it out as per the manual. Also I left the two little
capacitors in there too. Maybe what's good for your current 512K board is best
for the 1 Meg.

Glen  - why don't you strip out the sections where you do the fork, and post it
here in a msg? (be sure to use the post/store unformatted (SU) option so the
lines don't get scrunched up).

One thing is: Y= the size of the parameters in BYTEs, not pages... and you
should probably end the parameter line in a space or CR to delimit the filename
you're renaming. What kind of error do you get?

example code follows


 static  char mail_args[] = " foo!foobar!user < dead.letter";

 os9fork("mail",strlen(mail_args),mail_args,1,1,0);

 These two lines always cause mail to take input from stdin, not from
dead.letter as it should (IMHO). HELP!  this is giving me some trouble with
things I am working on for the uucp package.

To: BRETT 72057,3720 (X)

Brett,

I can't help you with question #1, but I can with #2. To use redirection,
pipes, and any other shell functions, you must use the system() function OR
fork shell using the complete command line as you would type it in from the
keyboard. In your code fragment, you are actually passing all that stuff to
mail, and it doesn't know what to do with it. System is easier to use, since
you don't have to put in all those other parameters. This is your code modified
to use the system() function:

 char *mail_arg = "mail foo!foobar!user < dead.letter";
 system(mail_arg);

If the command line is constant, you could also use:

 system("mail foo!foobar!user < dead.letter");

You can also use functions like strcpy() and strcat() to build up a command
line, something like:

 char *user;

 strcpy(user, "foo")
 sendlet(user);

  ....

 sendlet(user)
 char *user;
 {
 char cmdline[50];  /* make sure this is big enough, or use malloc */
 system(strcat(strcat(strcpy(cmdline, "mail "),user)," <letter"));
 }

Would issue the command: "mail foo <letter"

   To redirect I/O you can funnel the fork through shell as Bill said or do it
yourself through a sequence of Dup, close, and open system calls prior to the
fork.  For details on this last see Kevin's file, dups.txt, in LIB 2.

I have a question for you. In the November 89 Rainbow Marty Goodman did an
article on the *CART interrupt. He mentions your name. Well I did the fix on my
machine, and a friend of mine would like me to do a hack on his machine.

The only snag is that he still uses ROM packs with his MPI. So what I was
wondering, is...

Could I just solder the Schottky diode on R2, run the wire over to a jack
installed in the Coco's case. Solder a wire on pin 8 of slot 1 of the MPI, put
a plug on it and plug them togeather?

That way it shouldn't interfear with the other slots, you have a direct IRQ
line, and if you need to remove the MPI you just unplug. Also if you change
RS232 packs, you don't have to break into the new one for your patch.

Will it work?

~ Lute,
  It sounds like it should work.  So long as you're careful, I don't see how it
could do any harm... so give it a try.

 PS:  This reply is in reference to your Schottky diode to R2 (in the CoCo 3),
wire to jack, jumper to jack on MPI, etc... question.

Mike,

I'm not clear on what you're asking about getting 'this message permanently
into my profile', so I'll guess a bit.

If you mean, how can you set X1K as your default protocol ... you can't. CIS
doesn't officially support the protocol and offers it on an as is basis.

You'll have to use it on the fly.

Yes, that's what I meant -- "profile" is Unix-ese for "startup". Sorry I can't
set it peremanently -- maybe I'll de-ARC STerm and try B+ someday.  ANyway,
thanks for the good tip. --mike k

Mike,

You might want to move Sterm up on your queue. It's got to be the best package
for use here on CompuServe. It's B+ implementation is the fastest was to nabb
files from our LIBs, and it also has xmodem so it's reasonably useful on other
services.

But ... don't forget you can fork a shell from within. So I find myself using
Sterm as a base then branching out from there. For instance:

I log into a remote system in Orlando quite a bit. He supports several features
that make use of Vt100 emulation. By design, Sterm doen't have that .. but
nothing stops me from forking a shell and firing up OSTERM and taking care of
business.

Same system ... I also use KERMIT alot. Again, fork city and fire up Kermie and
away I go.

I did not notice if you had a 68K or 6809 system, but I run sterm on both. It
basically compiled right away on my 68K system, and the 6809 version was
already compiled for you, as I remember. Sterm is truly a great, Simple
TERMinal program. (Thanks Mark G if you see this).

John,
  Files with a ".ar" suffix are usually (if not always) ARchives.  You need
"AR09.BIN" for 6809, or "AR68.BIN" for 68K, OS-9.  Look in the utilities
library.  Also look for "AR.DOC" or "AR.MAN" in the same library.  After you
download the AR??.BIN file, copy it into your CMDS directory as "AR", and don't
forget to set the executable attributes.  After all thats done you can use AR
to extract files from any ARchived file.
  Files with a ".pak" suffix are also archived files, but they use the "PAK"
utility.  Look for PAK in the utilities section, or perhaps in the CoCo
section.  I don't know if pak is available as a separate binary file... it
might be available as "PAK.AR", in which case you'll need to get AR first.

I haven't called into CIS for a while... went through a month of messages and
discovered a lot of people have questions about ACIAPAK under OS9.  So I
figured I'd put together some of the things I've learned from making my
hardware and software run a login system with networking that is practially
100% reliable.

1) The basics of the RS232 Pak:  It responds to addresses 0xff68 to 0xff6b.
   It *NEEDS* to have an IRQ line (via CART) to the CPU so that it can force
   the CPU to pull each character out of it's buffer as it comes in.

2) The basics of an Multi-pak in relation to RS232 pak and OS9: Works with
   only one pak in the Multi-pak, because the pak switches the CART line
   to only one slot at a time.  ACIAPAK driver forces it to a particular
   slot (#?) so that even while disk access are occuring (although NOT!
   floppy non-halt disk accesses) the CPU can pull data out of the ACIA.

3) It is possible to put multiple ACIA ports on the CoCo.  Requires that
   you change the address of each additional RS232 pak by re-wiring it
   slightly (15 or less operation).  If using a Y-cable, just plug extra
   paks in.  If using a Multi-pak, you must tie the CART signal from all
   the slots and the card edge together to bypass the internal switching.
   NOTE: the CART line on CoCo goes low when *any* device needs servicing.
   Because it is normally pulled high with a resistor, any device that
   needs to be read just pulls it low - more than one pak or other device
   pulling the CART line down at the same time is not a problem, even if
   one is saying "service me" and one is not.

4) In the CoCo3, the CART line goes through the GIME before getting to the
   CPU.  This is a problem, as the GIME will occasionally (maybe once in a
   thosand) not signal the CPU that it received a CART interrupt.  This is
   what causes the ACIAPAK lockup syndrome - the easiest fix is done by
   wiring a certain diode in a certain way.  This was documented recently
   in Rainbow (I have actually been giving these away with install docs
   with software purchases for almost 2 years now).

5) When operating a call-in line, the ACIA generates a problem because it
   will ignore incoming data when there is no CD signal present.  The usual
   way around this is to force CD on the modem.  Problem with this is that
   you then loose the capability to sense CD dropping so you can kick the
   user off the system.  Or, you let CD go normal, and loose the CONNECT
   message when he calls in telling you what baud rate he is at.  I developed
   a device I call a CDI (carrier detect interface) which does the same
   thing that some more expensive modems (like the MT224E) can do- CD is
   left high (going to computer), except for a few seconds after the carrier
   is actually lost, which kicks the user off.  Then it goes back high so
   that you get the next CONNECT.  I will post docs on building CDI's...

6) The ACIAPAK driver has a handy feature that will automatically kill any
   processes with an open path to it's port when CD is lost.  Set the type
   or parity code to 0x10 (bit 4 high) to enable this feature.

7) Oh, when putting multiple RS232 paks on your system, you can use them
   under OS9 by just making copies of T2 and renaming the descriptor and
   changing the address to match the new devices.  I have had up to 4 Rs232
   paks running in one machine at one time, with no data lost.

8) You can run ACIAPAK outputing at up to 19200, but generally you will tend
   to loose characters inputing at anything faster than 2400.  If anybody
   has a better aciapak with bigger buffers that works reliably at faster
   rates, let me know.  This limit is imposed because of the buffer size of
   ACIAPAK and the overhead required by OS9 to get data in/out.

9) Once the IRQ patch (see #4) has been taken care of, communication is 99.99%
   reliable.  The only bug I still encounter occurs when a call-in user drops
   carrier having first stopped output via ^S or end of page.  The process
   won't die because it is locked on output.  To reset, first send a kill to
   the process and then do a 'echo >/t2', and hit ^E twice.  This causes the

HELP! I am trying to put a second hard drive on my system and the system isn't
recognising the two drives separatly. (Both LED's come on and neither one knows
what to do.) I have the /h0 and /h1 set up. Seems that I don't know what I am
doing with the hardware configuration.

The equipment: B&B interface, WD1002S-WX2 controller, /H0 is a
               Miniscribe 3425, /H1 is a Seagate 213.

Is there something that has to be done with the 8-pin jumper on the Seagate?
How about the controller? Is there something I need to do with it? I am sure I
have the data cables correct.

Suggestion anyone?
