Kev The first three files (on 7-24-90) in LIB 10 don't seem to have any
explanation as to what they are to be used for. Most other files have at least
a description. Thes files in question are readma.pak, sndmst.pak, fractl.ar. I
can ALMOST gues that fractal.ar is some sort of graphics oriented program
dealing with fractals. Is there some sort of requirement that a user must give
a description of a file before it is uploaded. If not, should this be
implemented to benefit all users ? TC

I hadn't noticed those, Tony.  The uploader can always go back and add a
description using the CHAnge command... or I suppose someone here could.
Sndmst.pak could be that SoundMaster someone is talking about. I'll go look.

I'm told the C: drive is an EEROM, but the drivers are on the floppy.  The
story gets more complex, though.  I bought Q&A Write after seeing a comment on
CIS praising its capabilities, and it has no difficulty driving the Epson DMP
(or the LaserJet) with the same drivers that TEXT doesn't work well with. 
So.o.o. I  now suspect that TEXT is the problem - and that is on the C: drive. 
What is a BP150 ROM?  Different topic - I'm using PROCOM with the GSFC business
main frame to use a characteristic known as a dedicated printer with the VT100
emulation.  The VT100 emulation works as a full-screen monitor with Escape code
cursor addressing, but when a special main frame printer program is initiated,
long data sets come in "behind" the monitor in a "dedicated printer" mode.  I
don't understand the details of what I'm saying, but in your VT52 emulation,
did you know about a dedicated printer and provide for it??  Ches.

On the Amiga, if you run from Workbench (the GUI), you can assign a program to
a tool... for example, if you click on an icon that belongs to a picture, you
can have it automatically call up Deluxe Paint, or a picture-viewer, and pass
it whatever parameters are needful (usually automatic). For example, an
AmigaBASIC program with an icon would automatically startup AmigaBASIC and run
the program. I'm not singing the praises of the Amiga, just pointing out that
that kind of thing will be possible (even likely) in your GUI, since you know
the Amiga. Dunno how you could do that from the shell, tho. Hmm..

Aye, the coco's gshell (gfx shell) does the same, tho with slightly different
file methods.

On the Amiga, you use a xxx.info file for each program; the coco took after the
IBM PIF file idea and uses generic  "aif.xxx" files, where the xxx is an
extension. So a program with the name, say, "picture.gif"  would use the icon
named in "aif.gif", and be passed as a parameter to the program named in
aif.gif.  The aif file is editable english... the icons are kept in one main
directory.

Some kind of combo deal would be nice.

Basic09 don't have a VARPTR. (It does have (ADDR(var)). I haven't used a poke

Not so.... same concept as Basic09, only less so. You pay once for the
initialization and startup code, and then once for each function you use. Only
ROF's that include called functions are linked in, not the whole library
(equivalent to Basic09's requirement for the 12K life support system).

Guess I better and my comments to the Basic vrs C debate, especially since I
have resisted using C for quite a while. First, the only time I recall using
PEEK/POKE in Basic09 programs was to do something like changing a string to
uppercase. My experiments showed the PEEK/POKE method to be much faster than
anything else I could come up with.

My biggest complaints with Basic09 are:

1. The primitive editor used. When doing something serious I always used my own
editor in another window, saved the source and then loaded into Basic
workspace. Seems to a waste of time somewhere here.

2. The fact that all "functions" are loaded as separate modules. All those
little modules kicking around always bothers me. Yes, Bill, I know the
advantage of being able to create large programs this way. But having
essentially a seperate program for something like "toupper" just doesn't sit
right with me.

But C ain't perfect either. What I do like about C is the large number of
functions already written (and debugged?), its portability, flexibility and
speed. But its tersness (extolled by some) really makes the learning curve much
longer than it should be. And getting a real handle on pointers is akin to
solving the Gordian Knot.

Dispite these problems I am now using C for most of my programming. I am even
avoiding assembler (which I really prefer) now that I C the light!

Yes, brother Bob, it's always good to hear from a newly saved soul (grin)!

Pointers are a but indigestible at first, but make rampant sense once you get
the hang of them. Candidly, I never have used anything with more than two
layers of indirection (i.e. char **woof), but some folks] revel in that stuff.

I'm taking a languages course at the moment, and we have to write 3 projects in
3 languages in 10 weeks. So far the cut has been project 1 was Pascal (Cobol,
Fortran, and Algol68 were the other options). #2 was either Prolog or Lisp (I
chose Prolog), and #3 is Smalltalk, ADA, or C++ (with emphasis on the object
orientation). The point of all this is that I now _really appreciate_ C's
terseness. It may steepen the initial ramp, but is a blessing thereafter,
brother Bob!

I neither like or dislike b09... it's just been too long since I have used it.
I recall that as Basics went, it was pretty slick. Major drawbacks are the
availabilty of reusable code (i.e. linkable libraries), requirement for life
support (Runb), and non-portability.

Mike,

I understand your need to detect carrier, but that should be done in the driver
and not the applications.  I know the current ACIAPAK doesn't do that, but one
should have been written that does.  (The Level II upgrade has one).  Then
again, I have never seen the need for a carrier detect. I have users logging
into my system all the time via UUCP or interactively and I have rarely had any
problem with applications not ending when they hangup.  Of course, these are
all knowledgeable people, probably more so than the average BBS user (not to
malign them).  This is not to say that you are wrong to do that.  You took care
of the situation in the best means available to you.

On another note, you mentioned to Kevin about keeping a signal from breaking a
loop so you could finish it first and then take care of the signal.  I don't
think it a good idea to mask them, even if you can.  I never tried it myself. 
What you can do is setup you signal handler to just set a flag that a signal
was received and then return to your loop. Once you exit the loop, check for
the flag and the go service the signal. Hmmm....you're programming in BASIC09
which doesn't return to the spot in the code where the signal was received.  I
guess this is not going to work.  Perhaps you should start using "C"??  This is
one example where BASIC09 just can't cut it against "C".

Huh, rand() is right.  I talked to Carl when there was a hubbub here about how

    {
        long time();

        printf("%d\n", rand());
        printf("%d\n", rand());

        srand((unsigned) time(0));      /* reseed the generator */

Mark, thanks for the additional comments on rand(). The problem is that
according to the recent docs you uploaded (as well as my original docs for
Carl's library) the syntax for rand() is given as rand(sf). Also, there is no
example in the docs (I'm looking at the page titled "math").

By the way, if a range is needed it is simple enought to do using the modulus
operator. For example, to get a random number between 1 and sf just do
something like:

    int n;
    n=(rand()%sf)+1;

Also, the way the function works is in agreement with other 'C' library info I
have.

Anyway, thanks again for the excellent job on the new docs. Having the whole
works in one manual is very nice.

MOTD = Message of the Day. Taken from a file in the  /etc directory on Unix
systems that is printed out as each user logs on. OS9 copied this and stuck it
into /DD/SYS I believe.

MOTD is also the name of the newsletter of the OS9 User Group. Bill Brady is
the editor.

MOTD = Message Of The Day... when you log into a system, it usually prints the
"motd" file in your /dd/sys directory.  Kinda like when you log onto CIS and
get the What's New stuff... or the bulletins here in the forum.

It's also, of course, the name of the OS9 Users Group magazine ;-).

[edited from BUSINESS WIRE announcement]

Tandy Corp. Wednesday introduced the Tandy 1000 RL -- "the first personal
computer with unique home management programs so practical and simple that it
can become an essential part of family life."

Sold at Tandy's more than 7,000 Radio Shack(R) stores nationwide, the price of
the ready-to-use systems range from $750 to $1,299.

In addition to the computer's built-in tutorial programs, Radio Shack personnel
have been specially trained to work individually with customers who have a
question.  A dedicated team of computer experts is set up at Tandy's Fort
Worth, Texas, headquarters for store representatives to contact for quick,
on-the-spot solutions. Customers with a telephone modem can communicate with
the technicians themselves.

The "RL" comes with 24 built-in programs developed especially to make everyday
home tasks easier.  Also, it is fully PC-compatible and will run other business
and personal software programs.  Its unique comprehensive approach to the home
and its ease of use has earned it the "Good Housekeeping Seal."

At work I'm forced to use an IBM, honest to god true BLUE IBM, pc, bit Istill
have and use the CoCo here at home. Thoufh I've been tepmted to look at some
other machines.. such as the Atari ST, Amiga, MM/1, and the tomcat.  I'm
feeling the upgrade itch.
  My sweetie wants to use this computer thing, and bare OS9 just doesn't cut it
for her.. Multiview might be a good temp fix, look for my general message on
the subject. You still in NC? Well, I got to scoot.

After several months of gathering dust while I moved, I'm back to using my
CoCo3 with OS9.  However, now I have my sweetie here with me and she7s like to
use this computer some too.

I'm an olde 'C' and Unix hacker by trade so bare OS9 works great for me, but I
don't want to inflect that on her.

So, in order to make OS9 easier for her (and me!) to use, I'm thinking about
the $40.00 splurge(grin) for Multi-View and I have some questions:

1.  How many modes to you have to make to the off the shelf
    version from R.S before it works the way it should? 2.  True or False: I
can run all my current Os9 programs
    under Multi-View. 3.  T or F:  I cen set up all my programs and files so my
    sweetie can use and access them with the mouse and Icons,
    sort of like she7s seen on a mac. 4.  I don't need to write my own programs
and utilities
    to make this all work. 5.  Multi-View can deal with my hard disk T or F? 6.
There is no question #6 7.  What Shocks am I in for with MV? 8.  T or F:
Multiview has been out a while and it's a
    "Mature" programs with us OS9 wizzes having worked
     out all the bugs. 9.   What "bad" things come with using MV? 10.  Whatelse
do I need to know?

If it can make my programs and files "Point & Shoot", then it'll be worth the
$$ and time i spend hacking & configuring.

Mark, let's see:

1. There are about 3 or 4 mods to make to stock GShell, all in Lib 10 here.
Hopefully someone knows which ones they all are <grin>. Ask again. 5 cents,
please!
   Actually, they speed up gshell, and add some new gizmos (Kent Meyers did
those). And you'll want (if you don't have it already), the FSTGRF.AR file to
speed up GrfDrv... it really helps with gshell and icons.

2. True. And you don't have to use MV always.. you can still open regular
interactive shell windows... even from MV. Gshell is just another program,
y'see... it doesn't take over or anything. Umm, VDG-screen games/etc do require
an extra util or two.

3. Pretty much true. You add icons, and what would be called PIF files on the
IBM, and gshell uses those to display and start programs.  Altho you may not
find yourself using gshell that much (which is in line with Amiga types not
using their Workbench, but instead simple shell windows like us), your sweetie
should find many things easier.
   I know quite a few people who have their machine set to come up into Gshell
so that their kids/wives can just click and go, pretty much.

4. Naw, icon editors and other utils are all over the place. I believe Mark
Griffith and Ron Lammardo helped with some of the Gshell-specific commands.

5. No sweat on the hard disk. Works best off there.

6. If no question, no answer. But you still get charged 5 cents <grin>.

7. Shocks? Slow, until you patch. Otherwise, not much.

8. Yeah, it's pretty solid these days, with Kent's patches.

9. No bad things, since you can always CLEAR to a regular shell. Maybe some
room taken up for icons, etc.

10. I'd do a "sca/sho/key:gshell" in Lib 10 and see what pops up.

NOTE* if you do a lot of programming (like you used to), then you may not use
it much. But your sweetie may. And besides, you need the Windint module which
is included to do/run the fancy menuing stuff around.

I patched MV rather painlessly to make it better and faster.  I use it on my
hard drive as well.  As a matter of fact, I think a hard drive really makes MV
shine.  Now, I had to do a little extra programming to get some of my existing
programs to work for two reasons:
  1. Some programs have to be run from the VDG window. You can find C programs
that will create a VDG window in the libraries.
  2. I have all my AIFs in one directory (called PROGRAMS). So, when a program
must access a different directory, I had to change it before booting the
program so I had to write some special boot programs.

If you want to do any programming with the point-n-click interface, the WindInt
module alone makes it worth the money.

Well it depends on what version of APBBS your using. if its the version
availabe for download here its version 2.XX.XX and is old and obsolete and I
lost all source code to it (thats why i strongly urge hard disk backups now)
version 3.00.00, 3.01.12/15, and 3.1.26 are commercial versions. since then i
have corrected that and about a thousand other bugs and made improvements which
is why its so obsolete. but i can tell you this. when logged in locally the
editor uses the INPUT command for the text and thats why commas aren't allowed.
in the newer versions (with newer drivers) i replaced all that with inkey and
my own getchar routines to bypass a bug in INKEY and ACIAPAK (still legit code)
and the commas are not a problem.

APBBS Version 2.XX.XX is really tough to work with, everything is hard-coded
and my docs were something to be desired. i wrote that for my use only and
thats it... version 3.00.00 and higher is a different story with a full manual,
enviroement files (no hard-coded) and a better I/O system to get the higher
baud rates plus tons of other improvements. if you wish to see the latest
version call my BBS at 717-586-2771 24hrs a day. APBBS can be purchased from
Second City Software (yes they are still with us but laying low for a few
months) the cost is $39.95.

I may send SC a check, then! I suppose the commercial version does not include
sources, eh? One thing I really DO like about the version in the libs is that
you did include sources. With them, I could add new features that I wanted, and
change some of the wording of some of the messages and such. Not a bad job,

Everett,
  Okeydokey....now what you need to do is download the file Bruce Isted
uploaded on modifying the Speech Sound pak so that it works at the CoCo's high
speed CPU rate. The file is in LIB 10 and is called SSPAK.AR.
  The pak depends on the CPU frequency of the CoCo, and since Level 2 OS9 runs
in the CoCo's hyper speed (grin) it throws the pak off, which is why it won't
fly. Making this modification to the pak will allow it to run with the CoCo3's
high speed.

I was just looking for something in my C manual (the MW.6809 version sold by

page there is a section "information" which implies that version numbers, etc.
can be placed in C programs. But just what is the "directive 'info'"? According
to the manual one should have something like

   #asm
    info /version/
   #endasm

But, of course, RMA has never heard of the op "info". Any one have any ideas as
to what this means--or is it just wishful thinking on the part of the person
who wrote the docs?

Bob - just a guess, but I'd say that perhaps they meant a label instead? Like
perhaps "info fcb version" ?   That would embed a number, tho who knows where
(unless they had you put it at the front, maybe).

I thought the compiler had an option to add the revision number? Or maybe
that's under OSK only. Dunno.

Not staring at a manual at the moment, but I believe that the CC (or CC1, CC2)

Hmm, I see what you're talking about, Bob. (Oh, btw, got the disk, THANKS!) I
never noticed that before, not sure what they are talking about, but as Pete
mentioned, there is a commandline option to set the edition number. Actually,
this is passed on to rlink, which actually sets the edition number in the final
memory module created. Looks like the info directive lets one put character
string data in for some type of identification, but since I never noticed that
in the manual, I haven't tried to use it. If you figure it out, let us know!

Does anyone know if there is a chunk of C code kicking around which will do
some kind of effecient data compression on a string. I would like to pass the
routine a pointer to a null terminated string and get back a pointer to a
compressed version of the string plus its size. The data would be ascii
characters (always) so I'm not sure what compression scheme would be best. LZW?
I've looked at the source for AR and I guess I could change it to work on
in-memory buffers, but I hate to re-invent the wheel all the time--besides, it
looks pretty complicated and is probably a case of overkill for my purposes!

Bob -

None that we know of. Also, the effects of LZW encoding might be lost on
parcels as small as simple strings. JJ and Carl are more up on LZW than I, but
I believe it analyzes a larger cross section for redundancies, and then builds
a table based upon the frequency of the redundancies.

If you were only working with ASCII, you could write your own that would take
characters and mash them to 7 bits. This way, you could have 8 characters in
every 7 bytes. If you were working with non numeric, or all upper/lowercase,
you could probably get a better compression as well by using less bits (6 or
5).

Hmmm, the 8 to 7 compression just isn't enough. My strings will actually be
quite long - probably 1500 bytes - and will contain a lot of spaces at times.
I'm toying with doing an index-card type DB. The idea is to have a full-screen
card which will get compressed and saved in a file. I'd like to compress things
to keep the filesize down.

problems.  If you're using an earlier version of OSK, Fred will send you an
upgrade to 2.3 for a nominal charge.

Re ARC.BIN - dunno.  Don't use it (I *think* it's used mainly by MSDOS'rs). I
use AR.  It's in DL12.

In scanning the OSK docs, I noted that the Tsmon provided is a clone of the
OS9-Net oriented Mtsmon (Microware's - not mine/Carl's).. In looking at it, I
*think* I noted that password files are STILL not using encrypted password
fields! Can this be true? Please tell me no...

Also - if the 'fix' is simply to adjust the attributes on the PW file for
root-only read, that's no fix. All the password related C functions (Unix,
Kreider LIB, and possibly soon to be OSK LIB) won't care for that at all.

Hi Pete!

In TOP3.tz in DL12 is a complete tsmon (mmon), login, password, etc system
using encrypted passwords.  I use an earlier version and its great.  Know
several other OSK users using the latest version and they're also happy. (Just
my 2 cents).

Good news! It's that a functional A for B replacement of the existing [M]Tsmon?
Compatible in all ways except password encryption? I can't believe that uWare
is still missing that boat after all this time.

    i'm currently running a disto mini controller 1 and two 40 trk dsdd drives

     i'd consider getting another 40trk, but i got the 26-3022 free, can't do
        that with new 40trks.

All you need is the appropriate descriptor.  I note that in the descriptors
that come with stock OS-9/6809 Level Two, there's a d2_35s.dd, and that could
very well be what you want.  (Just as a simple check, see if the length is the
same as your d0 descriptor--sdisk3, I think, may keep an extra field or two,
and I'm not sure what device driver you are using.)

Hi Keven!

We ran additional test on the 68010 VME machine under Basic 1.2 and 3.2. The
tests under 1.2 confirmed the original results.  Under 2.1, there was a 1
second improvement when k = 20,000 (integer) - otherwise the results were the
same.

Further investigation revealed the machine originally ran at 8.0 MHz.  The
memory chips were 150 ns.  The processor board was upgraded to 12/16 MHz but
the memory chips were not changed.  The system probably operates with several
(2 or 3) 'wait' states.  This invalidates the tests and reference to this data
should be deleted.

BTW, for completness and accuracy - I erred in the Basic Version for the 68030
tests.  The version of Basic was 2.1 *NOT* 2.3.  Also a note should be added to
the effect that the 68030 machine had a math coprocessor installed.

To: Pete Lyall 76703,4230 (X)


I thought I'd show you what I've come up with so far. I've been having trouble
with 'seeking' the sector were the FD is stored. As before, I have the dirpath
set up like this:

   TYPE direntry=name:string[29]; lsn0,lsn1,lsn2:BYTE
   DIM direc:direntry

This worked fine for reading just the filenames. I set up a second path like
this to get the rest of the info:

   TYPE dirsec=fdatt:BYTE; fdown:INTEGER; y,m,d,h,mn,fdlink:BYTE;fdsiz1,
   fdsiz2:INTEGER; y1,m1,d1:BYTE;fdseg:STRING[240]
   DIM dirnfo:dirsec

What is happening is, it will read the directory, determine where the sector is
by converting the varibles lsn0,lsn1,lsn2 in the sector number using this
formula:

  sector=((direc.lsn0*256)*256)+(direc.lsn1*256)+direc.lsn2

then 'seeking' the second path to the sector, getting to that path 'dirnfo' and
printing the results. (e.g. dirnfo.fdatt, dirnfo.fdown etc..) But after a
couple of records, I get an error 203. Do I have the sector formula right? I
tried 'seeking' the sector x 256 but that gave me an error 203 right away. I
also tried seeking to (direc.lsn1*256) also and got the same results.

A couple of questions:

a) Is 'sector' declared as a REAL?

b) The second path... how did you open it? It should have been something
   like OPEN /DD@, READ (not being a B09'er...)

c) Is the information you DO get valid?

d) Error 203 is 'Illegal Mode'... usually should occur at time
   of OPEN. If you're processing multiple directories, you still only
   need to open /DD@ one time.

e) Are you closing the DIRECTORY after finsihing with it, and before
   moving on to another one?

Mark,

I assume you saw my message about popen() and pclose()t(, didn't get any
response from ya. Are they supposed to be included in the documentation?

Also, a few others, _gs_styp() is not there and strhcpy(). (I wonder why
there's not an strhcat()?)

And there is still a mention of an int version of the sqrt() function, even
though it doesn't exist.

The echo test only proves that the system recognizes your SSC.  You may or may
not hear anything, so that fact that you didn't hear anything does not mean
anything unfortunately.  This driver doesn't support speech.

I'm afraid without more information I can't help you too much.  One person who
sent me a note on Delphi has had no problems so I don't think the program
itself is causing the problem.

You mentioned that 3 small screens were drawn before the 43 error. Were these 3
at the top right of the screen?  The program should draw 4 identical boxes.  3
at the top and 1 at the bottom left.  The program calls the box routine 4 times
consecutively so if it could draw 3 boxes why not four?  It doesn't make sense.

The only possible explanation left (at least that I can think of), if all the
necessary files are in memory, is that your process memory is full.

Sound.Master uses 2 blocks GFX2         uses 1 block XMODE        uses 1 block
RUNB         uses 2 blocks
                 --Total =           6

For certain shell calls perhaps another 1-2 blocks.

Since each process has only 8 blocks if for some reason your process had
another file mapped to it (say you merged GFX2 and Basic09, which would be a 4
block file) something would be squeezed out and POOF! an error 43.

But unless you provide some detailed information I can't help you. I need to
know your complete system config, MDIR, MFREE with all files in memory, etc.

Jim,

First, I'd like to congratulate and thank you for your Soundmaster program.
I've been looking for something like it for three years now (since I bought the
speech cartridge). Now, for some questions:

1) Why use the arrow keys? I'd prefer the mouse myself.

2) Is the device driver capable of speech? I would
   find that capability very useful.

3) How is it that the SSCart driver works with an
   unmodified pak? Is the Coco's clock speed dropped
   down to .89 MHz when doing sound?

4) Would it be possible to "un-hardcode" the window used
   by the program?

Hugo
