Yes, you're right.  If it is a bug it would be in RBF. I originally thought it
was related to Basic09 because the version of "login" that I am using updates a
similar file while "proc" shows that the user (of login) is *other* than user
#0.  But after dissasembling login, I see that F$SUser is used to change the ID
to 0 before accessing the file.

I also tried the same test with a program written in C and found the results to
be the same.  So it is not limited to Basic09.

Though I probably should have done this additional testing before leaving that
message, the basic question of the timestamp not being updated is still, I
would think, valid.

Paul - I looked up the code in RBF, and the date is changed when the file is
opened... no actual file data changes needed.

The weird thing: this is done only if A) file opened with write mode on, and B)
if you have permission to access the file.

Now (A) makes sense of course, and you did have UPDATE (read/write). (B) also
makes sense, but then the open should've failed altogether.

So a successful open using your code should always update the time, at least as
far as I can read from RBF internals. Strange!

Yes, the attributes of the file have been set as "---wr-wr" and the changes are

Well Bob, the original guestion on this thread was how to disable the BIOS ROM
on a HD controller for use with a Burke & Burke XT on a Y-cable. I have that
setup on one computer.

Another (dedicated BBS) has an SCII and B&B-XT in an MPI and I haven't had any
problems with it.  But I'm not familiar with the 4in1 board.

I think that the port on the 4in1 is not adressed at $FF68.  So to hazard a
guess as to what your problem is, I'd say to check and see if there is a /t2
descriptor on the CRC disk that came with the 4in1 board and use that one.  Or
check the manual to find the proper address and modify the stock descriptor if
that's what you're using now.

I hope it's a simple as that.  Perhaps someone else with a setup like yours can
jump in here with some help.

Unfortunately, it wasn't that simple. T2 works only when the SCII is plugged
into the coco, in spite of the driver combinations I have used form the Disto
module's disk that came with the 4/1 board. I read somewhere that I may have to
patch a driver to get /t2 to run, but I've experimented with a y cable setup
and may have take that route... at least I know that works.

By the way, has anyone heard of/from Arizona Small Computer since they stopped
advertising in the Rainbow?

It's pretty simple (what the trainer expects on the serial line). The

There is a program called DMP that I believe is available from the UG that is a
binary file lister/editor, I use it all the time for simple stuff.

I only have a binary out on my HD, I think I have the OSK C source at work if
you would like me to drop you a copy via mail.

I'll email you a copy of the binary in S-Record format, use "exbin" on it to
convert it back to binary then use attr to make it executable.

The only option is "-u" which means Update mode, If -u is not specified, you
can't modify the file you're looking at and it works like a normal dump
program.  Entering a "?" while at the program command prompt will display the
program's commands.

Hope this is what you need.

Both games require a low-res joystick.  However, I designed both games so you

your hi-res adapter plugged into the right port and plug a joystick into the
left one and play the game.

Fm: Dan Charrois 70721,1506
To: all

I have a question regarding the kill command.
  I've noticed that when I kill a process, I get the OS9 prompt back and
everything appears normal until I try some other command.  If the command
exists and can be executed, I get the first little bit of the command output,
followed by -003 (or whatever process number I just killed), a bit more of the
command, then ERROR #228.. Then, the command keeps on over the various lines of
OS9 prompts.  It would appear as though the process is killed alright, then the
confirmation (-003) and error are sent simultaneously when the next command is
being executed, though I can't tell for sure. If more than one process is
killed, things go haywire until that many alternate commands have been
executed.
  Aside from obvious inconvenience, it poses a problem for a C program I'm
writing to kill various processes.  They are all killed fine, but the C program
aborts with the deletion of process messages and then the ERROR 228. I've tried
to trap the error with both interrupt() and signal(), but it seems to get
through somehow at any rate.  Note than in my receiving the ERROR 228, I am not
trying to kill the actual C program itself, but various other routines.
  So, is there some way to get the kill(processnumber,0) routine in C to stop
sending the -003, etc. message and more importantly the ERROR 228? Does anyone
have any idea on what I am doing wrong?  I have always found this bug(?) in the
KILL command particularly confusing.
  Thanks for all your help...Dan Charrois

It's not C; it's the shell.  When the shell executes a command, aside from the
ones that have to be done internally (ex, chd, chx), it spawns a process to
actually run it, and unless you tack on an ampersand, it then does a F$Wait to
wait for the child to exit.  Currently, if the child's exit code is non-zero,
it prints out the "ERROR #whatever" message.

Here comes the fun part--unfortunately, the shell as it is currently written
doesn't pay any attention to the process id of the child that exited, so here's
what happens:

User types "cmd &".

Shell spawns process and doesn't wait, but comes back with a prompt after
displaying the process ID (say +003).

User types "cmd2".

Shell spawns another process, and does wait.

Process 3, running "cmd," exits abnormally for some reason, or is killed.

Shell is awakened from its wait, sees the non-zero exit code, displays the
ERROR message, and goes back to a prompt and a I$ReadLn to get the next command
to execute.

Unfortunately, if cmd2 is still going, it and the shell are now competing for
the attention of standard input.  To correct this problem, the shell would have
to keep track of the last process it spawned, and *only* go back to get another
command line when that process exited.  This is a bug of very long standing,
and like the weather, folks talk about it but nothing gets done, alas.

Yuck.. I read your reply, and I think I understand what's going on in the
shell.  That's really not very encouraging at all (though the fact that I
understand what's going on now makes things a bit better...)
  This doesn't make things look good.  My project was to set up a routine to
kill all processes associated with /T2 when a user logs off the port. It gets
all the process ids and everything, and all I had to do is kill them. The
routine is run, and it kills them okay... but when it's done, the shell that
started the routine is filled with all the dying process errors. Is there any
way whatsoever that an automated routine such as this can be initiated without
getting bogged down by the errors afterwards?
  Hmm... perhaps, could one kill the processes to /t2, and then kill the shell
from which they originated... then restart the shell?

Dan - I'm not quite sure what you're doing, but you could start the initial
processes with (program <>>>/t2&) ... the () starts a subshell which then dies
and Program is left as an orphan... nobody to report errors back to.

Also, whenever you kill off some processes, do some "w <ENTER>"  wait commands
from the shell to let the errors get on by.

I'm not sure which shell is getting the errors back, btw... do you mean the one
from which the "kill all t2 programs" is done from?  Or a shell on t2? Or?  
And is this a case where the "kill" bit in the t2 descriptor won't do what you
need?

  Well, that idea of the parentheses might just do the trick.  I must've
skipped over that section in the manual, but I don't recall seeing the idea of
putting the execution within parentheses.  It would probably do alright for
starting things up..  But do you have any idea how one could fork or chain a
program from within C to accomplish this?  The idea is that I had a routine to
check carrier running in the back, and when carrier is lost, it ran the routine
to kill all processes associated with T2. The only problem with using () is
that if someone is in a shell on t2 and they run a program from that shell
without the parentheses, when the routine to kill everything goes into effect,
the shell on t2 would get the errors.. I suppose if the shell on t2 is killed
in the process anyway, it might not matter...
  The shell getting the errors back is the shell from where I started the
processes on t2.  If I start up a shell on t2, run some processes, then kill
them (from anywhere), t2 gets the errors.  If I redirect input,output, etc. to
t2 and run a program from another shell, that's the one that gets the errors
when the programs directed to t2 die.  It looks as though the parent shells are
the ones dying on me.
  Thanks a lot for your reply.  I'm going to check out and see what I can do
about using the parentheses....Dan

Dan, You are re-inventing the wheel. Go to the TSMon lib and check out
logins.ar and login.ar. Both have a bye command which do exactly what you are

Dan,

I have a CoCo version of a command Pete Lyall wrote, which does what you want
to do. It will kill processes based on device name of standard in/out/error or
current program name. It peeks at the process descriptor to figure that stuff
out. It will also work with his login system (LOGINS.AR in LIB 7) and can kill
processes by user # or user name.  Its up to Pete as to whether he wants it
released or not. I thought it might be in the data libraries already, but
couldn't find it.

Chuck - dunno.  You could use VEFIO to snapshot the calendar screen to a VEF

But as far as editing the files, I'm not sure anyone has looked into this yet. 
Anyone who has, speak up! <grin>

There is at least one commercial product which takes notes and may have a

I know of no 'verify' utility. If you use dEd to patch the modules (profile and
mgt), then after writing out the modified sector, you then re-verify the module
with the builtin dEd verify function. If you patch with modpatch (which
requires the save utility to save the module after being patched in memory) you
just include a modpatch verify command (v) as the last command in the modpatch
script.

The omission of the hard drive on the Extended list is a result of leaving out
many features of the second board due to space constraints. It has turned out
ot be -- while not a tragic choice -- a cause for some concern, as some people
thought we might have dropped support of the hard drive.

Since you say that both your sound and joysticks are not working, I suggest
that you check IC7 (SC77526).  If the serial and cassette port also don't work
then IC4 (68B21) is probably bad.

Try the serial port also; if it doesn't work the problem is IC4.  If the serial
port is OK, then what part of the cassette port doesn't work(in, out, or motor
control).  If only the out function is not working then the problem is IC7.

        It has a Hercules card. I said that is was a 6845 but that was a slight
error. It is really a ASIC that emulates a 6845, parallel printer port,
decoders, graphics/text shift regs, timing regs and the like. I suppose that
6845 'compatible' as far as the regs and all, but cannot swear to it.

You've got them already if you got SK*DOS and the CSC C compiler for your

Hi Scott!

I left you some information regarding the Hercules board in the mail section. 
I did try to upload it here, but it was too long.  Hope it helps - If you do
finally get it running, be nice if you posted the code - Thanks

I have two questions:
 1.  What format does the paint program in DeskMate3 use and is there a viewer
that can show those pictures?
 2.  Is there any way at all to alter the hardware font set?

I know that the (coco 1/2) vdg had a way to alter the hardware font set, and I
had thought that the gime does too, tho I don't know.  I have often thought
about doing that, but never had the skill (or enough desire to compensate for
the lacking skill).

I would imagine that you could easily figure out Deskmate's paint program
format, unless some compression is done.  Take the size of a deskmate file,
subtract 16/17 bytes or so for palette, screen type, etc., and from there you
should have raw data.  count the size of the data to determine the number of
scan lines it uses, etc.  shouldn't be hard from a basic program.

Pete - there was at least one company in the old coco days, which sold an addon
board to allow changing fonts on the 6847.  Check the docs again, they mention
adding external EPROM for this purpose, I'm almost positive.

However, the GIME has no provision for external hardware text fonts.

From the back of my head, I think the 6847 pin was called I/E, btw... for
internal/external fonts.  But I could be waaay off on that name.

I am almost POSITIVE I read that the VDG chip had provisions for external
character sets.  I know that (Green Mountain Micro?) made lowerkits, and I
believe others did also.  I always figured that these used that VDG mode and
never thought that it might be, anyway.  But, I guess since the GIME won't do
it, it really doesn't matter 8-(.  <Sigh>, makes me want my MM/1 even more
<double sigh>.  Which, btw, I am hoping that it will support (a full)
256character character set?  I. E., provisions for emulating the IBM enhanced

Some compression is done on the picture files because they are only about 14k
long.  As far as the fonts, I just wish they would have built into the CoCo the
IBM primitive graphic characters.  At least I could see what I'm suppose to

What mode is used?  If it's 320x192x4 or 640x200x2 then mebbe just some scan
lines were lost.  A good way to check is make two pictures and save them.  make
them (radically) different, and then check the file size.

The "moded" (as in MODule EDitor) utility program supplied with OSK V2.3 will
do exactly what you want (I think) and works very similar to Burke & Burke's
"ezgen" for OS9/6809.

Quoting from the manual: "The moded utility is used to edit individual fields
of certain types of OS-9 modules.  Currently, moded can be used to change the
Init module and any OS-9 Device Descriptor Module.  moded can edit modules
which exist in their own files and modules which exist among other modules in a
single file such as a bootstrap file.  moded will update the module's CRC and
header parity if changes are made."

A file named "moded.fields" must exist that describes the module field
information for each type of file to be edited.  This is a standard ASCII file
that you can add your own module information to.  Microware provides a
moded.fields file with definitions for the Init module, and device descriptors
for RBF, SBF, SCF, PIPE, NETWORK, UCM and GFM devices. Definitions include the
module and device type, a detailed definition of each field and an optional
description of the field to be given when the user asks for help about a given
field.  The field definition includes: size of field in bytes, offset in hex
from the start of the module, base (ascii hex octal, decimal) that the field
contents will be displayed in (!), unused default value, name of associated
driver (optional).

The V2.3 release notes document the moded utility as do the new V2.3 (Revision
C) OSK manuals.

Yup, I have the moded utility.  But the way I see it, moded is only for working

basic functions I want are to be able to cut a section out and write it to a

Fm: Mark Griffith 76070,41
To: All

There seems to be a strange problem with the Shell (??) in OSK.  I can send
mail address parameters to a command like so: "rewop!sysop" and the shell
doesn't see the "!" as a pipe symbol.  Find and dandy.

Now, I try to do the same thing by forking a shell using os9fork(), and it
alwasy returns an error stating "can't fork "sysop"" as if it was now seeing
the "!" character even though it is enclosed in double quotes in the string
that is passed to os9fork() as the parameters.

Has anyone seen this before?  It works fine under 6809/OS9 Level II shell.

Gee.  I'm surprised that the shell doesn't see the !.  In any case, you should
seriously consider lapsing into conditional compilation for this one, and using
os9exec() for the OSK version, so that environment variables get inherited. (If
all else fails...have you considered domain addressing? <grin>)  (Oops... I
wasn't thinking about the quotes--I'm not surprised that it behaved as expected
in the first case.)  Could you post a code fragment, please?

James,

Basically, what was happening was; if you used os9fork() to run this string:

    rmail "system!user" <filename >/nil >>/nil

it would return an error of "can't fork "user"" even with the quotes. This same
command, if given at the shell prompt, worked fine.  It only barfed when using
os9fork().

What I did was use system() to fork the process.  It's not very elegant, but it
works.  The only reason I used os9fork() for the 6809 was because the string
being passed to the forked command sometimes was longer than the 80 char limit
enforced by system().  I assume this is not a problem under OSK.

I looked into using os9exec() after Ed Gressick fax'ed me the man pages for it,
but it was simpler to use system() so I did.  Works fine now. I do need to work
with it some more cause I'd like to get out of having to use the shell for the
command line redirection stuff.

They do that by executing the F$Wait system call, that tells them when it
returns either

(1) they have no children left to wait for

or

(2) child process number X exited with exit code Y (i.e. Y is the parameter the

Like James said, all that needs to happen is for the parent to do a wait() for
the child or for the parent itself to die.
 If it's really a problem to you, I can upload a timedwait(pid,seconds)
function that does a wait(), but does not wait() forever. If you're using OSK,
it accepts tenths of a second because of the alarm() calls.
 Let me know, and tell me OS9/6809 or OSK.

No, you don't have to wait immediately.  GShell probably does, though, and if
you type a command at the shell and *don't* terminate it with "&", then the
shell will F$Wait.  However, at *some* point, an F$Wait is a polite thing to
do--do you really have an application in which the parent doesn't care whether
the child succeeded or not?

A child process in the DEAD state has all its resources save for the process
descriptor given back to the system, so it's not using very much memory--but
process descriptors *are* a finite resource, so a parent process should check
on its children at least once in a while.  (Is this a pain?  Perhaps, but I
can't think of any scheme that would let a process find out the exit status of
its children and consume zero memory doing it.)

Certain GShell functions like the calculator, shell and others allow you to
CLEAR back to the GShell main window and do other stuff with the child process
still running in background. I'm not sure how it determines the passing of a
child, since if a process does have a child and you execute a F$Wait, your
process will wait until the death of the first child process occurs. I would
like to know how to do a "timed" F$Wait, where if a child is executing, the
F$Wait doesn't continue to wait, it just returns to your program as if you
don't have any children.

Zack,

Gshell keeps a path open to all child processes so it knows when they are still
active by checking the open path list.  This is how you get the "processes
still active" message when you try to stop Gshell with child processes still
running.

You could setup a sortof timed wait by having the child process send a signal
to the parent when it is just about ready to end.  The parent can then setup a
signal and using the signal() function, get interrupted when the child dies. 
The child would have to get the parent's pid from it' process descriptor.  The
parent, in turn, could keep a list of process id's that it forks so it knows
when all of them are dead.

Yes, I figured you could set up timed waits if you also wrote the program which
you wish to exeute in a child process, but what of a program you didn't write

Two programs:

In that case you could do something like Mark Wuest did in his timedwait.c file
he uploaded to DL12.  Send a signal to your own process via an alarm. That way
you can wait for the child to die and if it doesn't can wake yourself up.

particular program enough that anything I'd say without an example would be
even more hot air than usual :-).

I think I've figured it out . . . when you're not doing anything, F$Wait. When
you need to do something, either a signal from the mouse button or the keyboard
(data ready) will wake you out of your Wait . . . am I correct?  Does anyone
know?

That's right--an incoming signal will rouse a process from a F$Wait. 
(Otherwise you couldn't get back a shell prompt with ctrl-c after firing up a
process that does no I/O to the screen.)

Again, James is on the money. In Xinu, of course, you get a SIGCLD (or is it
SIGCHLD?) signal when your child dies, which is a lot better, IMHO. When *I*
write programs that are spawning each other and do not want to wait(), I have
the child send SIGCLD to the parent every time before it exit()s.
 Someone else could answer this, but I do not know how a parent shell knows
when its children die, but it does in OSK.

Oh boy!  Here's one that makes the Hitachi/Motorola dispute look like nothing!

Gilbert Hyatt, an inventor from California, has finally received the patent he
applied for back in 1970... the patent covers a "single-chip integrated circuit
computer architecture" he invented in 1968.  To you and me, that means he
appears to have the first broad patent on the MICROPROCESSOR!

The earliest previously granted patents were in 1973 from TI and Intel.

Whether it will stand up to challenge or not, is yet to be seen. However, as it
stands now, his patent could mean royalties for ALL microprocessors
manufactured from 1970-1987!

Wow. - kev

Phil,

First of all, what exactly are you trying to do with wildcards? Shell+ expands
wildcards within a command line, so if I type a command like "list *.c" and
there are three files, prog1.c, prog2.c and prog3.c, in the current data
directory, the actual command line generated is "list prog1.c prog2.c prog3.c".

This works great as long as the command issued can handle multiple file names.
A good example of one that does not work is the dir command, which assumes any
pathnames specified are directories. If I issue a "dir *.c", dir returns ERROR
#214.

I use the echo command to double check what really gets expanded using
wildcards, "echo *.c", for example. Another problem arises when the file list
generated by expanded wildcards is too long for the command being used. Many
commands assume that the input parameters won't be more than 255 bytes long.

Phil, the error 215 is symptomatic of wildcards being disabled (as you
suspected). Which version of Shell+ are you using? Versions prior to 2.0 did
not support wildcards. Versions 2.0 and 2.1 require that you place a colon
(":") at the beginning of each line to enable wildcard expansion. To turn
wildcards on permanently, there is a patch file included. Bill

The following source will generate bad code from both c68 and c68020 that come
with 'cc' version 3.1.  Both compilers will generate a call to float sized
addition in either the library or the trap lib, depending on the option
selected.  The -k=2f option (or c68020 -t881) will generate inline fpu code
that is correct.  Removing '++', using the '+=' shorthand, or removing
'register' will all permit the compilers to generate correct code.  They don't
get much more obscure than this!

Floyd,

Is the T3 you included in your boot file from the original system config disk?
If so, then its set up to use the MODPAK driver with a serial interface
addressed at $FF68 (like a standard T2 device.) MODPAK was written for the
modempak, will work with any 6551 serial port, but is limited to 300 baud.

If you want to use a second serial interface addressed at $FF6C (like a
modified RS232 pak) then use the M1 descriptor, which uses ACIAPAK. The other
option is M2, which uses MODPAK and a serial port addressed at $FF6C, the
standard modempak address. To summarize, the four Tandy serial device
descriptors are:

 device   address   driver

   T2      $FF68    ACIAPAK
   T3      $FF68    MODPAK
   M1      $FF6C    ACIAPAK
   M2      $FF6C    MODPAK

These names are not an OS9 standard, however, and have been implemented in
different ways by different software and hardware vendors.

Tsmon has NO ability to detect baud rates (like from a modem).  Why I dunno. 
It seems like such an obvious thing to do.  The OSK software from TOPS had
someting to do baud rate detection in the older version of their stuff but I

TSMon is meant for hardwired connections where no baud rate is needed.  That is
why TSMon does not do auto-detect baud rate.  If you need one, there are many
auto-detect TSMon-like programs for OS-9/CoCo, and I'm sure that with a little
hunting or such you could find one (or get someone to port one for you).

Jay,

Regarding porting stuff from 09 asm to 68k asm -- several of our developers are
really enjoying the switch and finding it no problem. So "porting" -- if you
take the phrase loosely enough -- should end up being less of a learning curve
that those Intel types had when they got the 386.

What I think we'll find, though, is that programs will get larger and perhaps a
little sloppier because we no longer have to optimize stuff to run fast and
small. Ah well.

Larger and sloppier does, amazingly enough, have some advantages. I, for one,
will be very happy not to have to spend the time and energy trying to cram 37K
worth of program into 32K!

With all that memory to play with, software developers won't have to resort to
obscure, convoluted logic to get the job done. This means faster development
time and makes enhancements so much easier to program.

The small memory available per process also made it impossible to port a lot of
software to OS9 LII, with OSK, that limit no longer exists!

I'm moving to a smaller place and no longer have the space to support 3 or 4

standard daisywheel printer (emulates Diablo 630), has three print wheels, does
proportional printing, and manages around 20 CPS. I have also upgraded this
unit to include an optional 8K buffer RAM chip, and detachable tractor feed
unit. I have top covers for use with and without the tractor unit.

This unit produces excellent quality print, and is a good substitute until you
can afford a laser printer (my next purchase).

Anyway... first $100 + shipping (I'd expect around $15) gets it. I'll be moving

and send a SIGHUP (#define SIGHUP 4) if the virtual circuit is cleared. If I
did not wait(), the process table would get rather humongous since I never die
(immortality is nice).
 I would like to understand this bit about "keeping a path open" to children,
as it sounds a lot more elegant than what I'm doing. Could somebody please

The problem is not with UUCP but with OS9.  OS9 does not permit the use of a
hyphen in a file name.

On the Coco, I'm using the new UUCP Mark Griffith is finishing up. However, to
cope with the hyphen problem, I've had to set-up alias files to provide
alternate names.

Mark is in the process of porting his version of UUCP to OSK.  As soon as he
releases some source code to me, I'll modify it for aliase names.

Hi, Kevin.  Just thot I'd let you know: I finally got around to getting the
latest of PT's offerings, which is the K4.  It's basically a -K2 with more RAM
(0.5 .. 4Meg, expandable to 16Meg), and with all the things fixed that I didn't
like about the -K2, viz.:

(1) It now has proper vectored interrupts, getting rid of that crazy INT 5
arrangement

(2) It has a four-layer board, so runs reliably at 16MHz (so far)

There are a few other nice improvements:  4 serial ports standard instead of 2,
NEC 765 + 1772 controller (apparently, the 1772 can't read some PC disks), etc.

I also got OS-9 with it.  Awhile back, the situation was that OS-9 only worked
with a separate terminal, but not with the PC keyboard and Herc card. That's
been fixed, and now it seems to use the Herc CRT very nicely.

Now all I have to do is to (a) figure out how to persuade SK*DOS, OS-9, and
Minix to coexist on my 40Meg HD, and (b) learn how to use OS-9.

Best, Jack

Glad you liked the info, Kevin.  Re the keybd/gfx interface, I don't know
enough yet about how they're handled by OS-9, but it seems that they're
definitely not treated as a glass TTY.  The system comes up with an impressive
looking semi-graphics screen, so I'm sure they're at least doing cursor control
codes.

As it turns out, I ended up with the OS-9 disks by mistake, and so they're
basically bootlegged.  Peripheral Technology has been giving $300 tradein
allowances on the older boards (how many companies have you seen that would do
that??), and so what they did was send updated versions of all the software. 
They didn't know that I didn't have OS-9 before, so it was just a simple
screw-up.

I never wanted OS-9, in spite of its reputation, because it always seemed a bit
overpriced to me.  Spending $400 for the CPU and $600 for the OS never seemed
to make much sense.  Also, the early versions for the PT-68 didn't use the
KB/CRT at all, but required a separate terminal, which defeats the whole
purpose.

But OS-9 is now listing for $299, and this new version seems very well
integrated, and booted right up.  So I called PT yesterday and got them to bill
me for the system to make me legal, and send the manuals.  Looks like I'll soon
be OS-9'ing for real.  I guess I'm glad they made the mistake, or I'd never
have considered it.

It turns out I could end up with no less than _SIX_ OS's:  SK*DOS, OS-9,
CP/M-68K, K-OS, Minix, and the one I'm writing.  Something for everyone! Let's
see the PC guys top that!

A couple of years ago, MicroCornucopia sponsored an effort (actually, more than
one) to get some kind of 16-bit hobby computer going.  MicroC got started as
the "house organ" for the Big Board Z80 SBC, which evolved into the Xerox 820
and finally the Kaypro.  I think their idea was to do it again, only with 16 or
more bits.  There were a couple of tries, including National 32000 chips and a
couple of coprocessor boards for PC's.

At the MicroC SOG in 1988, Joe Bartel of Hawthorne industries announced the
"Tiny Giant," which was a 68000-based system in 5.25" disk drive form factor,
like the Ampro.   In other words, the PC board would bolt to the side of a disk
drive.  To make it useful for anything, Hawthorne also developed both a
programming language and an operating system, the latter being called K-OS. 
Joe freely admits that it was a rough cut just to get something going, but
their concepts were pretty neat.  They developed a stack-oriented language
called HTPL, which was a FORTH-like language but with much more of a
Pascal-like syntax.  K-OS was then written in HTPL. They even had a Pascal
compiler, which used HTPL as the P-code.

Shortly after I got the PT68 and had written the review for MicroC, Joe Bartel
called me and asked me to port K-OS to the system.  I told him that I would,
but warned him it would be awhile ... at that point I was working hot & heavy
on my compiler tutorial series, and also was committed to writing a debugger
and linker for the PT-68.  Joe said that was OK, and he sent me a "developer's
kit," which consists of all the S/W, plus a cross-assembler and sample BIOS, to
run on a PC.  I never got the thing ported, and I understand that Joe &
Hawthorne moved on to bigger and better things ... they got a big hardware
contract and couldn't care less what happens to K-OS.  So I still have the
system waiting to be ported.  I plan to do it Real Soon Now.

Has anyone gotten Pete Lyall's X10 controller program to work with
OS9 Level 2 on a CoCo3?

What I'm wondering about is the device. Pete mentions that you should
use device /t1. Now, /t1 on a CoCo3 is the bitbanger port, which
has problems with accurate two way communications. It would be fine
with me to use /t1, since I wouldn't have to rig up an A/B switch
to switch between the X10 and my modem.

Any ideas?

You'll have to use your modem port (unless you want to try to use the BITBANG
driver). I've use X10 for years, right now its plugged into one of my COMM-4
ports. At one point in the past I rigged a relay off of the cassette motor
on/of switch to switch between my modem and the X10 controller.

Most of the values in the descriptor are 00, except for eor, which is set to
$0D and baud, which is set to $02 (600 baud).

Do you have tsmon still running at the time you're trying to diddle with the

Since Pete's got the moving bug again, I'm betting he won't be able to lay

Looking at the back of the interface, pin 5 is on your left ... 1 is on your
right.

        1       nada
        2       receive (input)
        3       ground
        4       transmit (output)
        5       nada

It's 8 bit, no parity and one stop. I've already mentioned the baud rate.

What do you type when asked for the directory?  If it is the current data dir
already, you can just hit [ENTER].  Try that and see what happens, because it
sound like it either can't find View or the pics. . .

Will try [ENTER] and see, but the first pic of girl loads OK, it seems like it
can't find "cards"... Are they also VEF pics, or is it another file name... I
can check with ident and be sure all are packed in file... Thanx... Judd...

Hi Jack!

I don't use the mono adapter/monitor but I checked my handy-dandy IBM book and
found the following data for the Hercules Graphics Card. This information can
be found in pages 147 - 148 of 'IBM Microcomputers, A Programmer's Handbook' by
Sanchez and Canton published by McGraw-Hill.

    There is a warning:
         'INCORRECT PROGRAMMING CAN DAMAGE THE MONITOR'

The following is for the HGC Display Control Register at port 3B8H (write only)

    Bit 0 - 1
    Bit 1 - Mode Select - 0 = Text Mode
                          1 = Graphics Mode
    Bit 2 - 0
    Bit 3 - Video - 0 = Disabled

    Bit 7 - Graphics Page Select - 0 = Select page 0
                                   1 = Select page 1

    NORMAL SETTINGS:
                 Alpha mode: 00101001B = 29H
    Page 0 in graphics mode: 00101011B = 2BH
    Page 1 in graphics mode: 10101011B = ABH

 The following is for the HGC Display Status Register at port 3BAH (read only)

    Bit 0 - Video Signal State - 0 = Vertical Retrace
                                 1 = Scanning

    Bit 4 - Not used
    Bit 5 - Not used
    Bit 6 - Not used
    Bit 7 - Vertical Synchronization Signal - 0 = Raster in vertical retrace

 The following is for the HGC Configuration Switch at port 3BFH (read-write)

    Bit 0 - 1 = Graphics mode allowed
    Bit 1 = Access to page 1 allowed
    Bits 2 thru 7 - Not used

    HGC CONFIGURATIONS:

Ed, thanks for the info.  I had that already, tho.  There's a book out that
describes the Herc card pretty thoroughly, and I have that.  What I was really
looking for was C-code examples.

You have to approach all of this pretty gingerly, because of that warning you
quoted.  As far as I know, the IBM PC is the only computer system ever designed
in which a software bug can and will destroy the hardware.  Ain't progress
wonderful?

We used to say, when teaching neophyte programmers, "Don't be afraid to try
things or to make a mistake.  Nothing you type is going to hurt the machine." 
When you're programming the CRT, though, this is definitely _NOT_ the case,
anymore.

Here is a program I wrote using the using the info Ed gave me abount setting up
the Herc card. When I run the program it puts the card into Herc graphics mode
but in the process it turns the snowy and wavy. This I suppose is the
'graphics' mode but only half way I guess. #include <stdio.h> #define  
VID_CARD   0xD70001 #define   HGC_CONT   0xFA0771 #define   HGC_CONF   0xFA077F
#define   HGC_STAT   0xFA0775 * These defines are set to configure the Herc
graphics card.
        The formula to convert IBM addresses (video) to PT68K
        addresses is (IBMVid * 2) + C00001.

   For non-video conversions: (IBM * 2) + FA0001.    */

char *video = VID_CARD; unsigned char *v_controll = HGC_CONT; unsigned char
*v_config = HGC_CONF; unsigned char *v_stat = HGC_STAT; char c; int i,n;

main() { video = (char *) VID_CARD; v_controll = (unsigned char *) HGC_CONT;
v_config = (unsigned char *) HGC_CONF;

*v_controll =0x2b; *v_config = 0x1;

printf("%x\n",*v_controll); printf("%x\n",*v_config);

video = (char *) VID_CARD; for (i=0;i<2000;i++)
        {
                *video++ =0xff; } }

Hey Jack this news WILL fill you with enthisiasm!!!
        I went to Peripherial Technology for it is just doun the road. Fred is
working on a EGA/VGA driver for the k2/k4. He showed me some VGA slide shows on
the k2 and they look TERRIFIC. If you have ever looked at any of the IBM VGA
slide shows you'll know what I am talking about. He says he will eventually
develop graphics primatives for the drivers, but the 'slide shows' was enough
to convince me to buy.

That is good news, Scott.  Most of the people I know who are using the PT68 use
it only as a glass TTY ... Unix-oriented folks, mostly.  It's always bothered
me that we haven't done more to explore the graphics-oriented aspects that the
H/W is capable of.  As soon as I got the -K2, I got a book on the Herc board
and set out to find out how to use its graphics capabilities.

But somehow, it all fell by the wayside, in favor of more pressing matters like
how to get a screen editor that worked, to replace EDLIN!!!  Or a linker.  I've
spent two years, off & on, with SK*DOS.  Those are the kinds of things we have
to worry about with it. I really like the general concepts of SK*DOS ... I've
referred to it as the CP/M of the 90's.  That is, I prefer simple, small, OS's
that let me get to the hardware with a minimum of fuss, and upon which I can
build the rest of the pieces I need.  But SK*DOS hasn't done much lately, and
the user base that you need to get public-domain programs floating around just
isn't there.

I'd love to see what the -K4 can do with VGA.  My guess is that, given the
speed of the processor and the large amount of RAM the CPU can hold, it could
be spectacular.  Who knows, maybe mice and icons are only a (shudder!) step
away.

Jack - oh, they are! (mice and icons close by)   As soon as I can get ahold of
a PT/VGA setup, we'll be porting my (still being worked-on) OSK windowing
system to it.  The Atari port isn't far off, and of course the MM/1 and
hopefully the TC70 will be running it, too.

Got any ideas, now's the time to pop me on the head <grin>!

Don't worry, Jack, there are plenty of command line die hards (and I count
myself among them) that will seldom use some of the slick mouse/icon stuff.
Remember, however, that that kind of interface is extremely important for a
very large percentage of computer users. Just like the talk show hosts say, if
you don't like it, turn it off! If you don't want those little trashcan icons,
don't use that interface. Note to developers: please remember that there are
users that don't like rodents, or pull down menus, or cute little icons!

Whew.  That's a relief, Bill.  When I first saw the Mac, I fell in love with
all the slick graphics stuff.  I also bought one of the first Amigas.  I
quickly fell out of love again when I learned;

(1) How much of the computer resources, both CPU time and memory, go into
supporting the stuff

(2) How _HUGE_ the applications are

(3) The fact that programming for a GUI can become your life's work

My idea of the ideal OS is one that's absolutely minimalist, but also modular. 
In other words, all I really want the OS vendor to build in is the essentials:
File system, file & device I/O, and program control.  Then anybody who wants to
can add their own favorite user interfaces.  I'm working on one like thap`3or
the PT-68.

Jack - my entire club went down to look at the first Amigas... we were excited
until we found out that the editor and other programs weren't reentrant... you
had to take up memory for another copy each time you started another session
multitasking.

Amiga programmers are getting better at writing more programs as reentrant, but
an awful lot of stuff still isn't.  Always seemed like a waste of a 68000's
talents to me.  I used to accuse them of treating the 680x0 cpus as "giant
6502s" <grin>.

Jack,

Now, trash cans are sometimes OK for some people, so don t go crazy. Any
windowing system worth it's salt will let you configure certain parts -- and
give you access to a shell, so you can circumvent cute icons when you're hot
and heavy.

I use multivue from time to time, when my brain is too fried to use the
characterbased approach.

Paul, at the SD'90 conference, there was a discussion forum called, informally,
the "GUI wars."  I took the non-GUI side.  I won't say whether we won or lost
(there was some pretty hefty talent arrayed on our side), but it sure became
clear that GUI is not the answer for all problems.  When doing something with a
GUI interface takes more keystrokes, more time, or more skill than with a
keyboard, that's where I draw the line.  I have no problem with GUI's in the
abstract, and I use a Mac quite a bit for document preparation, and especially
slide presentations.  Where I start to have a problem is when to have that
feature takes up 256K of ROM and about 50% or more of the CPU resources. 
Sometimes, try doing
               cp foo*.bak b:

on a Mac.

Better yet, try  addlib foo, which is a BAT file I used to use to:

       (1) Assemble a subroutine
       (2) Add the object file to an object library
       (3) Add the source file to a source library
       (4) Delete the object and source

Hi Jack & Scott!

Been following your thread - most interesting.

I have 2 k4 machines - they are used for business.  One machine is for our POS
retail system.  The second is for applications programming and a back-up for
the store system (Haven't had to use it as a back-up yet).

My first machine was a k2 purchased about three year ago.  The second was
purchased about six months later.  BTW, I was customer #2 for the first k4
boards - Don't know who customer #1 was - I think he was an industrial user.

A VGA board is on its way to me - should have it Monday.  Going to be
interesting. Now all we need is a wysiwyg word processor.

Sounds interesting, Ed.  It's good to hear that people are starting to use them
for commercial purposes.

For the record, Ron Anderson has been using a K2 (with SK*DOS) for some time to
develop software for a wheel-balancing machine.  As near as I can make it out,
the K2 is actually embedded in the machine.  John Spray, the developer of
Whimsical, just recently moved from New Zealand to the US, to work with Ron.

Jack,

Well, Ed has been using th PT for YEARS for business!

Not a bad product, and given Ed's tenacity, he apparently has gotten them to
work very nicely for several projects!

Glad to have you guys around -- are you all into OSK?

Paul, I've been using SK*DOS with the PT up till now.  The idea of paying as
little as $200 for the computer, and then $600 for the OS, never made much
sense to me.  To tell the truth, when I upgraded to the Pt68-K4, Fred Brown
sent me OSK by mistake, thinking I already had it.  So since I have the disks,
and the price _IS_ quite a bit lower, and it _DOES_ seem to be integrated much
better with the PT68 than it used to be, I called Fred and asked him to make me
legal and send the manuals.  I probably never would have gotten it otherwise.

Scott, mostly I use the PT-68 as therapy.  When I had a CP/M Kaypro, I used it
for everything:  Word processing (I write articles once in awhile), learning
new languages and software techniques (I like to try algorithms and things like
that, mostly in Turbo Pascal), and systems software.

When I "upgraded" to a PC, I got tools to do the first two, and use the PC for
that.  But MSDOS is so horrible, I refuse to try to write systems software for
it.

So the Pt68 is my "hobby" computer.  It's simple enough so that I can tinker
with it, play with interfaces to the hardware, and write my own systems
software.

I've been using SK*DOS, which is small and simple as CP/M was.  It's a nice
system to develop software with, although (Peter Stark's not gonna like me for
this) it's sometimes frustrating because of the slow disk I/O.  SK*DOS is a
clone of Flex, and uses the same chained file structure.

Working with  SK*DOS has been an adventure because there are virtually _NO_
software development tools.  For some time, we didn't even have a screen
editor, and the assembler is non-relocating.  But gradually we've gotten better
tools.  I wrote a hex debugger and linker (both have new versions in the
works), and John Spray of New Zealand has a wonderful little compiler called
Whimsical (not commercially available, so far).  There's also an integer C
compiler, plus Small C.  I got interested in writing translators, and am
working on yet another compiler (my own language, called KISS), as well as a
couple of preprocessors for the assembler.

Right now, I can't say which way we'll be going with the PT-68.  Several of the
users are into Minix, and I have that running.  I also now have OS-9, but no
manuals as yet.  Either of those platforms make a lot more sense for software
development, than a system where you have to build your own tools.

Still, I'll probably continue to play with OS stuff.  I have several alternate
OS's available, plus I'd like to try my hand at writing a CP/M-like OS.

I know, I know, CP/M is obsolete.  But it always met my needs pretty well
(after I replaced essentially every utility in it!), and it _IS_ fast and
small.  For me, even Minix or OS-9 are a little too big & complex for my
tastes.

Jack,

I don't think you'l have to wait long for PD OSK software. IMS is encouraging
our developers to release a lot of their little stuff as PD. So the MM/1
isgoing to give a nice boost to you PT 68K owners! (I have one, too, BTW. It's
got Simmy Turner's terminal driver on it and it screams when it scrolls!)

But, to be honest, the MM/1 is getting the lion's share of computer time around
IMS and the developers. If you read the Business Week mag that's on the stands,
you'll see why.

Still, a PT with VGA and Kev's windowing would be nice.

About once every coupla months, someone asks about OS9 on the Stride/Sage

Seems like one should be done tho, as there are a lot of those machines around
in schools and surplus.  If you had the $$ (about 1500 of them, I think), you
could buy a PortPak and install OS9.  best - kev

OK Kev.  Glad to hear you'd already condisered hacking the B09 editor. It's too
bad that B09 wasn't built "modular" like OS9 itself, so the editor, math
package, etc. could be worked on separately.

Ya know, as much as B09 (or MWBasic) is still used in OSK, you'd think
Microware would get its own people to update that ancient and frustrating
editor.  And then windowize the whole thing, like Atari ST basic. --mike k

exactly (basic09/mwbasic needs a better interface, editor).  Although I
disagree on you with having it modular (separate modules) would be better.  I
run into *lots* of trouble with packed basic09 programs (in which every
separate little procedure is a different module).  Although it is usually a
problem because of the 64K/8K at a time barrier.  I would much prefer
modularity at the source level but have it combine into one package in the end,
like C.

Godd -- Dynsatar is the only editor I use these days. I can see where B09's
would be faster for a LOT of global changes where you were SURE that you wanted
every one changed. B09 editor's one saving grace is the instant syntax error
detection-other than that, it would be better if B09 forked off your favorite
editor and autmoatically sic'ed it on the program in question.

Fm: Don Kircher 76346,3475
To: All

 Ok I've finally relented and sprung for a Coco3 I was very content with level
one but the disturbing lack of support for Coco I & II did it. The lack of
available Wordpaks to be exact.
  So, now Im faced with a whole new system and a forest of new
incompatabilities. The most distressing so far is the inability of OS9 Level II
to "see" the driver for my five meg hard drive.
 Its an old J&M arrangement with the neat side port that comes off the
controller allowing one to boot os9 level one off the hard drive. I'm safely
booted into OS9 Level II but the boot I configured with J&M's /h0 will not iniz
and returns an error 246.
 This really is a disaster I was counting on this working. It leaves me with
these two old grey upright disk drives to run Level two. Such a distasteful
thought that Coco3 is banished to a heap in the corner until some other
arrangement can be made.
 Oh yeah, the system works fine under level I on my Coco I and on Coco II (I've
managed to collect six cocos so far) The controller works fine in Coco3.
 Thanks

Don,

Knowing absolutely nothing about what I'm about to say ... and even less about
a J&M compatability issue  ... let me mention that many level one descriptors
needed a byte in thier header to be changed from $00 to $FF.

I believe Pete mentioned this 'mode byte' in a message a while back about
someone having difficulties getting a midi descriptor to work.


In any event, perhpas this note will spark some discussion that can be helpful.

Don -

Besides having to change the /h0 address for L-II (change the byte at offset
$0E in the descriptor from $FF to $07), the error 246 you get is "drive not
ready".

CC3Go (like Sysgo) tries to chd/chx to /h0.  Is the drive already running and
up to speed when you boot?

Also, the CC3 runs at double speed. I think the J&M HD interface can handle
that, tho.

Seems like there was something else, also. Let me dig around.

and probably shortened the file sizes greatly as I doubt I would have gone to
the trouble of supporting VEF squashed format.  And also allowed picture

I am a Librarian on the Aquarium Fish Forums (GO AQUAFORUM & GO AQUADATA). I am
having a problem uploading ASCii files to my Library's.

The problem is that when people using TAPCIS try to read these uploaded files
all they see is the line reading over itself.  Undoubtly TAP does not make a
linefeed at the Carriage Returns.

All of the other staff members using various Term programs from Mac
(NAVIGATOR), Commodore Term (And several other COMMODORE Terminals), Along with
me (OSTERM, and UltimTerm (RS-DOS)), have had no problem reading these files. I
did have the problem with Telstar (OS9).

I am using SSTAR to make the files.  According to one of the SYSOPS, I do not
have a Line Feed and Carriage return at the end of each line, just a <CR>,
therefor, TAPCIS will not administer a LF, and the lines will run all over each
other.

Let me know if you can help, I am desparate to find out what is wrong.

Rodney,

You've got the problem figured out. OSTERM monkeies with the LF's.

Not being a fan of that program I don't know ... but is there an option of
adding linefeeds when you upload? (Some terminal programs do allow for this).

I'll have to fire up my copy and take a look.

Have you had a chance to look at your copy of OSTerm ?

I tried turning off the LF Filter, but no JOY, still the same.

I also tried uploading with TELSTAR, and WIZ, No Joy.

I downloaded the STERM.AR that you are using, and am having a hell of time
getting it going.

You'll find that STERM will add linefeeds after C/R's like you want plus it
takes advantage of CIS "sliding window" B-protocol which is very fast since it
doesn't stop between blocks.

  Well, I've talked to a few people about graphics and what my machine is
doing. Aparrently my colors do not correspond quite to standards . . . nor does
the timimg.  I have one of the first machines to be released . . .  The first
problem it had was working with a J&M Controller . . .  It had problems working
with the Tandy controller(minor), until the clock was adjusted, but faild to
operate correctly with the J&M.

   Also, do you know anyone who has had any ideas on making a processor
accellerator for the CC3?  Say an 8 to 10 mHz 6809(Yes they are avialable)
(where? forgot) . . . or a seperate hi-speed 6809 processor board with it's own
memory.... using the coco as a slave???

I would like some help with a problem I have encountered with my new hard
drivew. I just purchased a segate 125N hard drive and I am attempting to run it
with a disto super controller II and hard disk interface (under the SCSI mode).
I am using the drivers supplied by CRC-Disto. The problem is that when I boot
up the boot process does not acknowlege the Startup file on my hard drive. If I
reboot using the reset command then the startup file is used. Iwould like to
know if there are any fixes for this problem or any suggestions on how to solve
it. As well I have already tried changing the boot order around and this makes
no difference. Further, the RBF and disk drivers are all in the same block. I
would appreciate any help anyone can give me. Jim Pottage

Hi Jim.  When you first boot, is the hard drive already up to speed? It could
be that it's simply not ready to accept commands right away.

Hmm. But does it switch over to using the hard disk command directory right
away?  If so, then my explanation doesn't wash.

How about posting your startup file... maybe there's a clue there.

I have also looked at the startup file. However, the startup file worked fine
with a WD1002-shd controller and 10meg hard drive. However, below is a copy of
the file in case you have any suggestions. Note that Rutils is a file that
contains extra commands that I have not included in the Shell file like copy,
date etc. Further, while booting the harddrive is accessed (ie the light turns
on for a breif moment) but the startup file is not used. It seems like the
drive has not  been initialized and the boot procedure cannot find the startup
file. As well, occasionally the hard drive will be accessed for no apparent
reason while the system is running. Here is the startup file.

load rutils display 1b 34 04 * Echo welcome message echo * Welcome to OS-9
LEVEL 2 * echo * on the Color Computer 3 * * Lock shell and std utils into
memory link shell montype r * Start system time from keyboard setime </1 date t

Thx - no, I'm not worried too much about the boot order.  You said that things
switch over to the hard disk okay, but the problem seems to be only that the
Startup file isn't executed the first time on boot?  But only on reboot?

That's awfully strange.  Let me see your startup file.  I have some ideas on
things which might cause this.

Oh. And when you boot first time, does it just ignore startup and still come
out at the shell prompt?

Fm: Robert A. Larson 75126,723
To: all

In porting C news to os9/68k, I've noticed a couple of bugs in the C compiler
that comes with osk 2.2:

        "string"[0] != 's'

        sizeof "string" != 6

The first one generates code that does a string derefernce, but does store the
string to derefernce.  (Two NULs are generated for the string to derefernce.)
This bug was fairly easy to work around, I just changed a macro to generate
slower smaller code.

sizeof a string constant returns 4, rather than the number of chacters in that
constant.  This bug was much harder to work around, since strlen does not
result in a constant.  Working around this created much bigger, much uglier,
and much slower code.

Could someone see if these bugs are fixed in osk 2.3?  (Microware hasn't
answered their mail.)  Are the nasty problems in make fixed?

(If anyone is interested in getting usenet on an osk machine, I'll probably be
ready for C news/Rn beta testers in a few weeks.)

Termcap is very much a least-common-denominator thing when it comes to terminal
features (but very much a kitchen-sink thing when it comes to bizarrre terminal
misfeatures, e.g. the Hazeltine's inability to display tildes).  Definitely no
graphics.

The only references I've seen on termcap are manual pages that all look pretty
much alike, and pretty much like what you found in the compiler manual.  Sad,
but true.

Pete,

I'm having a bit of a problem with go. In the doc file you state the way to
invoke a command macro to enter: go <command filename> <arguments>. You go on
to describe the <command filename> and the <paremet [D, whoops, the
<parameters> which I assume are the <arguments> previously mentioned. You state
that the arguments must be pathnames. This is confirmed upon inspection of the
source reveals you parse the command line with a F$PNAM system call. This
forces the arguments to comply with OS9 pathname convention.

My situation is that I want to call up a procedure file from cron using a go
script nut use <numbers> as the arguments. It is a procedure file will calls my
pager. My pager requires a numerical code to display.

You now say, well you have the source, fix it yourself! Well, I've tried that,
too. But simply trying to compile it with LI ASM, I get an error, "Can't open
/d0/defs/os9defs". The program source refers to /dd/defs/os9defs. ASM itself
does not contain the character string /d0. Any idea why ASM is requiring this
defs file to be in /d0/defs when both the source and ASM do not refer to /d0?

Thanks,

Zack

P.S. GO isn't mine... I did a bit of fixing, but it originated in the UGLIB.
Quite a goldmine in there really. Had I written it, I would have allowed non
