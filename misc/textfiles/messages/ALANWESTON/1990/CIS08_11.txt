I'm in the process of updating and correcting the Microcom ramdisk package (I
guess I should mention this is legal - I'm the author) to work properly with
the Disto one meg memory upgrade.  What's your system configuration? I'll need
a beta tester or two to make sure the thing actually works --- I'm still at
512K here.

SO there actually is a real person called Dennis Skala. I guess that there is
also some truth to the rumour about some new version of os9 as well !!!! Just
kidding ! My system doesn't have the 1 meg upgrade in it. I installed it in a
friends system, since he is not too good with a slobbering iron. But just for
the record, I have 512k. I would be happy to ask my friend to be a beta tester
if you are willing to send him /me the driver and information needed. But it
will have eto wait for a while as He is going on a business trip this Ssaturday
for 1 week, and I will be leaving for vacation for 2 weeks, a week from this
Friday (8-10). I hope I can find an os9 system back there to goof around on. 2
weeks without LII can be considered cruel and unusual punishment ! Please leave
me a message as to how/when you woul like to do this. Thanx for the info. TC

Just got my copy of Planet Engine 1.1, and it's one of the more fun things I've

I seem to recall that there was once a program to enable reading data from

pc-dos does for ms-dos disks.  If my memory is correct, is the file available
in this forum? Does such a program truly exist? Help - I have 92 data files on

The only Apple/OS9 interface I was aware of was a card called the MILL, and a
version of OS9 ported to it that was written by Steve Childress (my ex boss).
Other than that, I don't know of any disk read/write tools for the apple..

Best/most universal way is to get a terminal emulator up on both machines, and

STERM13 in DL 12 appears to be cooked.  It will crash OS-9/68000 v 2.3 on a
PT68K-2.  Any attempt to use an escape option that requires an input string
from the console (such as esc-S or esc-X) will crash the system, with plenty of
garbage appearing on the screen.  OS-9 appears to be attempting to execute the
contents of the console input buffer. Other programs are better behaved, so I'm
not sure if the crash is caused by a bug in STERM13 or the PT drivers.  The esc
Q option, which requires only a single character input, doesn't cause any
problem.

Gilles -

I also have a Roland D10 (among other synths, samplers, and rack toys). There
were some MIDI tools written in OS9/C, but most were for the Casio CZ-101/1000
family. Almost all the other stuff is written for the RSDOS environment.

Biggest reason is that MIDI requires a 31250 baud port, and a computer and
buffering scheme that is capable of keeping up with it (at least in bursts).
Because of interrupt latency, and time slicing, OS9/6809 really cannot do the
job unless a) You have a smart interface card that does processing and
buffering or b) You cheat out OS9, and lock your process into the saddle.

There are lots of programs for the IBM, Atari, and MAC that are wonderful for
use with the D10. If you were motivated, writing one under OS9 might not be too
weird... as I said, Richard Johnson wrote a Casio Ed/Lib using technique b)
above.

Good luck.

 Thanks for the info. My information about OS9 disk fragmentation comes from
mainly a review in Rainbow about Chris Burkes "FILE SYSTEM REPACK " and the
Burke and Burke advertisments. The implications is that all you have to do is
"think hard disk" and things get so bad that the system almost grinds to a halt
. I had the feeling that I would have to "repack" my disks constantly to be
efficient . Thanks again,I'll sleep better tonight.
 I am new to the OS9 opperating system and need help from time to time.

Carl,

There seems to be a problem with the password functions.  In the example below,
the second call to get the name returns NULL in all cases.  If you swap the
functions, then same thing happens, i.e., the second call always returns a NULL
even if the name or uid exists.  Apparently something is not getting reset in
endpwent() ???  Any ideas?

    if (getpwuid(atoi(pw[ID]))) {
        fprintf (stderr, "\nUID %s is already used\n", pw[ID]);
        endpwent();
        exit(0);
    }

    endpwent();                 /* close password in case getpwuid fails */

    if (getpwnam(pw[NAME])) {
        fprintf (stderr, "\nUser %s already exists\n", pw[NAME]);
        endpwent();
        exit(0);
    }

    endpwent();                 /* close password in case getpwnam fails */

Hi Kev--I've been trying to get the code in Rainbow July <Kissable OS9> to run
and I cant. The problem is in the window section line 7000 onward. When it
opens the new window I cant bounce back to the old one until the new one is
gone. When the called procedure ends, the new window wont go away unless I
bounce a little with the clear button. Then the original window comes back.
Dale Puckett said he thought it was my windint and that I should check with
you. If you haave any thoughts on it I would appreciate your input. Thanks.

Opps.vef and STitle.vef show up black because all the palettes in the pivture
are black.  SPoker sets the palette up so that you can see them when it is run.
As for having to press BREAK, I do not know.  Can you give me a little more
information?  What happens, when do you hit break, what happens after youo hit
break, etc.  Your problem seems to be unique so far.  Please tell me a little
more so I can best determine how to solve your problem.

Apparently, it never does reset the palettes. I have to hit break a couple of

You should also have a file /dd/sys/ttytypes (or ttytype), and it should have
the name of the terminal type for the device you're on, i.e.:

  /term coco
  /w1   coco
  /w2   coco
  etc....

To: All

Everyone,
  I have been working on a sound playing module for BASIC09 that will
  play .pla (macsound) files.  I disassembled the newest PLAY command
  and discovered that its author uses 4 system mode calls (AllRam,
  MapBlk, ClrBlk, and DelRam) to play up to 2 meg for sound.  I have
  tried this techque from BASIC09 using SYSCALL but it won't work
  I get an "ILLEGAL MODE" error. I assume OS9 is telling me I can't
  use those calls from a user program... but if not why can PLAY also
  a user program get away with it. I have disassembled SYSCALL and
  it makes no checks so the error must be coming from OS9 (right?).
  Is there anyway around this problem and if not how do I go about
  "un-protecting" the system mode calls as is mentioned in the manual
  I know someone out there must know.

  Any help would be great.

Jim I finally got sound master to work after stripping down my system to the
point where I was almost at RSDOS again. Just kidding ! But I did have to
remove unused window descriptors and modify my startup file so MV wouldn't
start. When I finally got done I had 432K free, and soundmaster finally worked.
It was impressive to see such a graphical representation. But I couldn't figure
out a few things. When I turned on the oscillators, I could here a ticking,
like a metronome in the background, as well as the tone that was being
generated. Your doc file didn't say anything about that so I was kind of
puzzled. Also I was just playing around with the controls, and the SSpak
started talking to me. I'm not kidding ! It mumbled a few letters / sounds, but
it was speech. Your doc file did not say anything about this either, and I have
not been able to get it to do it again. I think the user interface needs some
work, like mouse control instead of arrow keys, and it neds to be able to run
while multi vue is up ! I kept getting error 207 even without multi vue in
memory (gshell) and only TERM running. Also you mentioned the chance of doing
it in C instead of Basic 09. Got my vote here. For the pre-canned sounds that
you included, it seemed that even when they were playing the oscillators were
all set at 0, so where were the sound being generated ??? It was fun playing
with it, and will look forward to talking to you about this. THANX. TC

Hey all (especially Kevin, Mark G, Carl, etc),
 About 2 years ago I got feedback on this forum for a multiplexing protocol
convertor we were putting together. It is "soaking" with what we believe are
the last bug fixes presently in a test lab and should go to Beta early next
week. After 7 weeks in Beta, it will go into the 4 largest Digital Central
Offices in the world to allow various Support Systems enhanced access to the
switches and monitoring equipment located therein. After that, it will be
gradually released to other Digital Central Offices.
 FWIW, here's what we ended up with:
 1 Motorola MVME 147 (68030, 8 mb, 150mb disk) running os9, a board-to-board
routing application, X.25 network access applications, and Support System
interfaces.
 1-18 Motorola MVME 333-2 (68010, 512kb ram, 64kb rom) running os9, and level 2
and 3 of any of several protocols, or a user-interface. These have 6 ports
available for async protocols and 2 ports for sync.
 We have our own block-serial file managers (bfm and pfm) that handle (along
with block-serial drivers) data transfers between the 147 and the 333's and
read and write access to the 333's ports.
 The 333's are just devices to the 147 (/slot3, /slot4, etc) and vice-versa
(/host). We get about 400 512-byte packets/second composite backplane data
transfer with our application fully loaded and running.
 Bill West, Inc (comprised of Bill West) wrote the backplane driver and file
manager with help from developers on our team. GCOM, Inc licensed the X.25
level 2 and 3 drivers for network access and access to equipment that has X.25
interfaces directly to us.
 Thanks for the input at the time!
 Mark
