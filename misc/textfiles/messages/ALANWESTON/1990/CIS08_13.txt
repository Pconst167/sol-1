David,

It posible for us to move anything for you, however, the forum doesn't have a
Hardware/Technical section per se.

If you'd like to type SN and view the choices, then let me know what strikes

I will upload it into DL6 with a note that it includes your additions. This

There are so dang many formats out there (and how 'bout that revised GIF

Brett,

Is is possible to implement word wrap with the version of MicroEMACS you
uploaded to dl 6? Also, can mode be changed? One more thing: procs tells me UE
grabs up to 32k of buffer while the internal UE buffers never add up to more
than 13 or 14K. Which is right? Or are they both right?

I had no problem getting the program to run on an old level two system using a
Wyse 50 terminal... even the "cut and paste" from one window (file) to another
(file).

Other than that, the program works VERY nicely.

Kev, IMHO, hacking the "stock" F$PrsNam would not be a terrific idea, and even
replacing it via OS9P3 might not even be too swift. I've seen programs that use
F$PrsNam for other things besides path names. Maybe just change "rename" to
allow nonstandard file names for the orignal file? Bill

If you do this for OS-9/6809, will you do it for OS-9/680x0, too?  And, doesn't
that mean a new kernel?

Naw, no new kernel.  Remember that each function can be replaced individually
under OS-9.  Someone noted that F$PrsNam was used by some programs for other
purposes and might get screwed up, but I don't see how/why.  Valid names are
valid names.  "-" options elsewhere have spaces in front.

Not sure why you should have had out of mem problems!?  But try my new version

help (long boot lists can be tricky) You shouldn't necessarily have a

Gerry,

Error 237 signals a shortage of "system space" ram, NOT overall available ram
(which is what MFREE reports.)

In OS9 LII on the CoCo3, each process is limited to 64K, this includes the
"system" process. Included in the 64K for the system process is the boot file.
You may be able to make some changes to your system setup that will free up
some more room within your system space. Unfortunately some of these changes
might require removing something that you want! And remember every little bit
helps, sometimes all you need to do is free up 256 bytes. You can use Kevin
Darlings SMap utility to show used and available system space, sometimes his
PMap is also handy. This is a partial list of things you can do:

1. Remove something from your boot file. At first this may sound drastic, but
analyze what is in your boot file, and think about what you actually use. Do a
"ident -s OS9Boot" to see what is REALLY in there, sometimes there are
duplicate modules, which take up extra space! Someone here can help you out
with what you might be able to remove, include the output of an ident (-s
please!) of OS9Boot or a "mdir e" in a message.

2. Reduce the number of active processes. I used to run 4 or 5 shells all the
time, this ate up precious system ram, so now I've cut it down to 3. Each
process takes up at least 512 bytes.

3. If you really don't need VDGInt, then boot into an 80 column "window" and
remove VDGInt from your boot file (if you want to do this, ask how). Some games
and programs require a VDG screen, so make sure you really want to do this.

4. Don't INIZ any device unless you really have to. This way (hopefully) each
device will only use system ram when its being used (this isn't always
practical, and doesn't always help, sometimes Kevin's DDir and Paths utilities
help figure out what is going on as far as open devices and system memory
usage.

I hope these suggestions help, feel free to ask any questions. Most of the OS9
gurus are busy working on software for the MM/1, so don't feel slighted if it
takes a while to get an answer!

I thought more about your problem and it sounds similar to another one that I
experienced while testing my program (Error 207 problem) The reason I got the
error was because my SSCart and SSC were not placed properly in the boot list (
In my case I tried just LOADing them into memory) You may have to move them
around a little to get it right.  Make sure you are actually CONFIGing and new
disk or EZGENing it. To test whether this is the problem: When your system is
up and running with your normal configuration and SSCART and SSC are in memory
type ->   INIZ SSC
                                ECHO HI >/SSC If either of these gives a 207 or
237 error your SSCART and SSC need to be relocated.  They are not being
accessed properly. Let me know if you still have probs.

Sunny - I wouldn't risk it.  VGA usually runs at 30Khz+ scan rate vs the 15Mhz
or so of the CoCo. Running the higher rate on the CM-8 would fry it (or at
least burn out the flyback transformer - I hear about $85 repair) very
quickly... perhaps in seconds.

Some VGA clone cards may go back and forth between scan rates (the ones which
use multisync monitors), but....

Ed:
    Common TeX is available on BIX, but you need to get the input, font, and
format files elsewhere.  Also on BIX:  a complete set of DVIxxx code.  I don't
know how well it works (I've yet to load the 5Meg of input/font/format files).
It wants a solid meg of RAM to run - definately not for a "small" machine. (It
won't run on my 1040ST - once the kernel et al  is loaded, less than a meg is
available - it is happy until it tries to load the format file(s) on my Force
CPU-30.)

Hi Robert!

Yeh, memory can be a problem.  I have 4 Meg and can add another 8 if I have to.
I understand the users in Germany (the ST is very popular there) were plagued
with memory problems, too.  They were going to do something about it.  Don't

If you haven't already received an answer to your question on how to disable
the BIOS ROM, here is some info I received from Burke & Burke (nearly 2 years
ago) that should do the trick.

...."To disable the ROM, simply remove jumper W3 on the hard disk controller
board.  Please note that removing the ROM will not disable it due to address
buffers on the circuit board. If you are unable to disable the ROM by removing
jumper W3, cut the connection to pin B12 of the 62 pin connector on the CoCo XT
and solder a wire between pins B12 and B11."....

I had to use the alternate method since my controller (WDXT-GEN) did not have a
W3 jumper.  Be aware that the pins on the 62-pin side of the CoCo XT are
numbered consecutively, unlike the 40-pin side with odd/even numbers on
opposing sides.  The "A" pins are on the component side and "A1" & "A31" are
marked.  "B" pins (unmarked) are on the reverse with "B1" directly under "A1".

You mentioned a "powered" Y-cable, so I assume you're aware of the need to
supply 12v to the controller.  If you are using an *old* RS floppy controller
you may also need to modify that since they were not fully decoded and respond
to the addresses $FF50-$FF53 which the CoCo XT needs.

So far I've worked it out with the MM/1 hardware folks that honest /MIDI device

The trick is to support each other into getting the HW/SW developers of the MM1

BTW, UltiMusE-III "cheats" in only one place -- writing directly to the serial

Basics popping up on the PCs, it's nice to brag that we were there long before.

I just find B09 awkward to wrok with.  Probably could improve my attitude a LOT
by using a real editor in another window, re-LOADing each fix, instead of
messing with the built-in editor.

Seriously, Microware really should update that editor for fullscreen. But if
you use it only for quick fixes, what the heck.

B09 desparately needs an an "include" or "Use" file thingie so TYPEs can be
defined the same in all procedures. Also Microware should do a compiler from
I-code to binary -that would give the PC crowd a run for their money. --mike k

I am in the process of setting up my OS9 Level 2 system up for remote logins
using the standard tsmon/login package. I have a strange situation, though.

I have patched SHell+ V2.0 so that my shell prompt is "What now? ". notice the
space in between "What" and "now", and the space after the "?". This was done
by putting a $06 at those locations in the binary.

My problem is this. When I login to device /t2 through tsmon/login the $06 is
not interpeted as a space, but as a null character, so my shell prompt becomes
"Whatnow?", with no spaces at all.

Any way around this?

I first tried a space. When I patched the prompt to be "What now? " with $20 in
the two space locations, I get the prompt "What". It became apparent that the
FIRST space encountered signalled the end of the prompt string. I forget who,
but someone recommended using a $06 where I wanted imbedded spaces, tried it
and it works. Only not with device /T2. Works fine in VDG and regular window
devices, though.

So, any ideas?

Zack,

Interesting.....a $06 is an ACK, so maybe something is eating it on your remote
end.  You might try changing it to an $A0 since that is a space with the MSB
set.  Maybe the other end will just strip the high bit and leave you with
showing a real $20.  Of course, on your CoCo it'll show as a dot ".".

Reminds me of the time years ago when someone said Tandy was selling CoCos in

As I mentioned, $20 would work fine for "normal" VTxxx terminal emulation, but
it doesn't work for standard window devices locally. When I used $20 as the
imbedded spaces, I got a prompt of "What". The FIRST apces signals the "end of
the prompt string". Since I use my system more locally, I will probably leave
it like it is for now.

Flight Sim shouldn't be affected by the CART IRQ stuff. It uses internally

I take it that you're booting from their stock straight-to-game disk?

If so, it sounds perhaps more like a disk drive alignment or read problem, to
me. Is there a friend close by whose system you could try it on?  Many of us
have really old disk drives nowadays, and they get weak over time (and out of
wack).

Try cleaning up the disk controller contacts, multipak contacts, anywhere you
have a cable or plugin. If that doesn't work then I'd try to test it with
another drive (perhaps take your 512K coco down to a RS store).

Thanks Wayne!  You meant grfdrv, not gfx2, yah?  Grfdrv had some orphan
(unused) code left in it where they obviously meant to speed up horizontal line
draws by setting entire bytes (instead of just pixels which could be half bytes
or even single bits in 2-color mode, right?) whenever possible... like on a
longer line run.  All I did was, well, throw out their stuff and write my own
version of what they had intended to do <grin>.

Vertical lines always set the same bit positions within a byte, and so were
already inherently as fast as they could go. If that makes sense ;-)

Kevin,
  You are right. Stupid little error. I was attempting to write my
  BASIC09 code more like C-Code so I made the following declaration:

  F_AllRam=$39

  I forgot BASIC09 assumes all Un-Dimensionalized varaibles as REAL.
  So I passed syscall a real when it wanted an Integer or Byte.
  It just grabbed the first two byte of the floating point number
  which must have contain a nonexistant System Call number.

  That does lead me to another question though, is there a way to
  relatively easily convert floating point reals to longs (4 byte
  integers) or integers in an ML program.  I understand some about
  floating point numbers but not enougherstand how to convert
  between the two.  I wish the Poel RMA Library had included some
  floating point number routines.

Steve - yah, I do that all the time myself.  Whenever a basic09/syscall program
doesn't work for me, I first go back and check to make sure I wasn't passing a
path number as a real, or an Integer to a Byte var, etc.

I don't know of any float->int/long stuff around.  To a 2-byte Int I just let
Basic09 do it (Ints are 4 bytes under Basic/68K).  I'll ask around, tho.

That is exactly the problem.  Do you want the patch, fixed source, or a fixed

The Data in memory is modified to look up a different pixel type depending what
is on either side of it. But you build that into the mappng routine itself. The
DAC has what amounts to 750,000 colors due to the effect. Its about a $50 in
small quanites. If you dont turn this mode on it acts just like a standard DAC.
But if your building a windowing system you build the tranlation for the DAC
into in and your set. Its going to eat about 10% of your cycles to do it but
thats cheep compaired to other anti-alising techniques.

Ed,

FYI, while the sysops don't mind a request to delete a file, you can request
that a file be deleted (if you uploaded it!) by typing ERA at the library
"Disposition !" prompt. In most forums the sysops will ask you to make sure you
really want to delete a file.

Also, if you upload a file with the same name, the system will delete the
original file when the sysop enables the new file. You can also update the
keywords and description by typing CHA at the "Disposition !" prompt.
Unfortunately you can't rename a file, but a sysop can. (You may have known all
this already, but it might help someone else.)

 If you work for AT&T in a Digital Central Office, you'll be getting one within
the next year (like it or not). It replaces the "DCO-PNI" and is called "RAPP".
 If not, you'll never see one unless you purchase AT&T DACS frames and your
company arranges to have them and their facilities supported by the AT&T
Network Operations. It's not something we plan to sell, but will be used
internally only. There will be a total of about 300 made.
 FWIW, we passed our soak in the testing lab this past week and go to Beta in
the White Plains, NY Digital Central Office tomorrow (tuesday).

Depends on how they're laid out in memory--though actually, that's only true if
you do something rather sleazy.  The non-sleazy way is to recall that A is the
most significant byte of D, B the least significant (do me a favor and don't
tell Ms. Methvin that I didn't say "more significant" and "less significant"
even though only two things were being compared, OK? <grin>), so if you cast
your char * to an int, do something like

regs.rg_a = ((int) cp) >> 8; regs.rg_b = ((int) cp) & 0xff;

to get what you're after.
