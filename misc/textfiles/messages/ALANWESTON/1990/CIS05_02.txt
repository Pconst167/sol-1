But Mark, the use of a declaration such as:

 func(array)
 int array[][6];

is standard.  I don't have K&R, but it's clearly stated in Gehani's "C: Food
For The Educated Palate" (Gehani's with Bell Labs and states in the preface
that he follows the C Programming Language Reference Manual).  It is understood
that what is passed is a pointer to the array and that the array is not copied
as are normal variables.  The brackets and the second dimension tell the
compiler the pointer points to a 2D array and is partioned in six column rows. 
The COCO compiler accepts this declaration but due to a bug uses the wrong
dimension to partion the array, ie the first rather than the second.
 By the by, I checked out your more complex declaration ie:

  int (*array)[6];

and it compiles just fine on the COCO compiler.  You are to be thanked for
pointing out what I think is the best way to program around the bug.

Mark,

Since you seem to have all the answers <grin>, how do I define a ointer to an
array of pointers with a variable number of elements? I have a situation where
I want to define an array of pointers to strings, but I don't know in advance
how many strings I need to point to. I want to be able to malloc() the array of
pointers, and then use a pointer to get to each element. I know how to define a
variable array of integers, and a pointer to a fixed array of pointers to
characters (which is how I've got it working now, just defining a large array)
but haven't found any examples of how to define a pointer to an (undefined)
array of pointers.

This may appear overly simple, but have you considered using a NULL string as
the nth entry to indicate the end of the array(s)? Make that a NULL pointer.

Bill,
 This will do what you want:

 char **sp; /* declare a pointer to a character pointer */

 sp=calloc(MAX,sizeof(char *)); /* assign it to the base of a block of
                                   memory to hold the pointer array */
 sp[0]="string 1";
 sp[1]="string 2"; /* now you can use your pointer as an array */

In C array variables are pointers to the base address of the array memory, and
any pointer may be used as an array variable so long as you assure that it
points to a free block of memory of the appropriate size.

Dropping characters is a classic symptom... do you have the IRQ hack installed?
Do you have an upgraded multipak?

 The multipak is upgraded and the diode IRQ hack was done.
    Something I've always been curious about:
       I use a Disto RS-232 Superpack in slot2 as /T2. The instructions
 that came with this pack contained a modpatch for AciaPak that I've
 tried using. It has never made any difference in operations. So I don't
 use it. Do you know what the story is with that? To quote them;
   "If you are using a COCO3, the Aciapak driver can inadvertently turn
  off the interrupts via the GIME chip. A fix using modpatch will
  prevent this".   They then give the patch. Doesn't seem to do anything.
          ????   Paul

Paul - the patch is a common one to ACIAPAK. If you use one of its serial
ports, and then cease using it (so that say, /t2 deinizes), then ACIAPAK
normally shuts off interrupts from the MPI.

For the interrupt-driven SC-II (or any other interrupt-driven device out there
on the MPI), this would be catastrophic. I guess they must have included the
patch "just in case" <grin>. - kev

I have heard of mixed results using the diode version of the hack. The straight
IRQ hack is simplest, and works well. Also, it is slot insensitive.

BTW - any particular reason you're not using slot 1 (the recommended slot)?

   I don't know what the "straight interrupt hack is". What I did was connect
all the slots together on one pin (pin 8 if I remember-it's been awhile) and
then do that diode thing. Haven't had any problems.

Colin,

For the best price on a 2 meg upgrade, you can look around now in Computer
Shopper. Look for SIMMs, 1 meg by 8. These are the same SIMMS used in the Mac
ii series, so they'll remain pretty inexpensive.

It was one of our design goals to use a lot of standard parts. The more
standard a part is, the more reliable and cheaper it is.

Hence, you can have a full >>3<< meg system for far less than you would think.

BTW, we showed the MM/1 at a special meeting of folks from a Charlotte NC
computer club -- we could have sold quite a few of 'em!

We had a great time, and look forware to meeting with Color Computer users up
and down the east coast.

Hi all,
  I've had a request from a local CoCo club member for a fixed printer driver
for Home Publisher and a DMP-110 printer.  Does anyone know where I can get
such a thing?  The problem is apparently due to the DMP-110's horizontal
dots-per-inch, which is denser than most DMP printers.  I'm told that circles
print up as ovals (squished in sides), and so forth.  Any help is greatly
appreciated!

Zack,

As Pete said, use something other than 0, since the data area is at least 256
bytes, then leas 255,u should always work. Using 0 causes the stack to start 0
off of U, but since the stack is used "backwards", the page preceding the one
pointed to by U will get zapped. (You probably already know this, but in case
someone else is wondering) a PSHS X instruction does the same thing as STX
,--S. Whenever a register is pushed on the stack, the stack pointer is
decremented. So the stack pointer is usually set to the end of the area to be
used for the stack.
