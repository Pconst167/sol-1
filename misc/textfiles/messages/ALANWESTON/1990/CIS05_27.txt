~ Yeah, Paul!

  Anxiously awaiting full specs on the MM/1, including an estimated release
date, OS, software, hardware options, $$$, etc.

  I casually dropped a reference to the MM/1 and OS-9 in an I*M forum dedicated
to specs for the 'ultimate' home computer, and was deluged with replies for
more info.

  Everything that they wanted in the 'ultimate rOME computer' is being done
right now with the CoCo and LII, with the exception of touch screens, so the
MM/1 should be that much better if you haven't left anything out!

Thanx a bunch. I spent [D [D [Dabout 6 hours customizing my startup file trying
to get those damn windows working. I don't know what I did but I got it to
work. I have 4 windows come up out of startup, and also 1 for mv. The 1b21 for
the mv window seems to work, but not for the other windows. So I7ll live with
that until I can find out more about windowing. In addition to that I've
optimized my system for spedd. Sorry, about the typos, but I can't backspace
with osterm !!! look at the [[D's abouve. Thats what comes out when I hit the
backspavece key. Anyway I have had the disto ramdisk cartridge for over a year,
and I have only really used it to compile programs without ever accessing the
HD. (I can remeber whemn I used to compile off a two floppy drive system. Talk
about slow !!) Now I format it on startup, load it with cmds, apllications,
icons, aifs, and procs. MV is in high gear now. (Fastgraf helped a lot too !).
For some reason , when I start up osterm from th ramdrive, it comes up with an
unable to link to macro mesassage, and just sits there. But when I run it from
the HD, it is ok. Any ideas ?

Getting back to the original topic. (Sorry, but I had to blow my horn. I spen t
a lot of time trying to get the damn startup file e to finish executing. It
would just quit in the middle, soemtimes with an error sometimes not.) It
turned out that While I was using Window Wwriter, it left a control character
or teo two in there, and them buggers is invisible ! I usually have it strip
out all control codes, but maybe it left some anyway. I can see it now, the
compiler is gonna choke on th those control chars. Looks like I need to write a
filter program !

Kev, the only other files that osterm uses that I know of are the osterm.ddir ,
osterm.options, and another one for user defined macros. Whenever I start it up
(from the HD) it usually finds the first 2 files and I get a 216 error for the
macro files, because it doesn't exist (I haven't created any macros yest). This
is ok, because I have been using it like this for a while. Now since I put it
in the ramdrive, I get the "unable to link to macro "error. It seesm to me that
this is a module of some sort that it is looking for in memory (which it
probably yanked out of /h0/cmds, before), and now it can't find i it. But after
doing an mdir, while it is running, the only osterm related module in memory is
osterm itself. I'll try to get in touch with Vaughn.

While I was using OSTerm, I cranked it up this way:

1) chd to ramdisk
2) run the following procedure file:

copy /dd/sys/osterm.options osterm.options
load osterm
load filepick
load transfer
load macro
load autodial
osterm <>>>/1
unlink osterm file ick transfer macro autodial
del osterm.options

The procedure file was in my current CMDS directory with e attribute set.
I think Shell+ is also required to do that. (run a procedure file not in your
data dir)

Thanx Zack. I got osterm to work out of /r0. I just had my startup file copy
the other 4 files you mentioned. I didn't have to unlink any mod   ules cuz
there not in memory. Only osterm is. I have been having some other problems

  Just for curiosity's sake, why don't you compose your replies offline using

Great idea, but I don't know how to upload these messages. I assume they must
conform to some sort of standard. Can you tell me how to do that ? I figured
out why the backspace key was screwing up. I had osterm set to ansi graphics
mode instead of TTY. Now I can backspace ok. How would I know what my replies
would be unless I logged on and read the messages first. Is it actually better
to log on get your messages, log off write your replies, log back on and upload
them. Sseems like a lot of trouble but if will save me connect time i'll try
it. But, I do need some info on how to upload messages as well as files that
can be put in the libs for others to download. THANX TC

~ Ahh, so!  Maybe I can help here Tony.

  You're using OSterm, if I remember the past msgs. in this thread, no?  I'm
not at all familiar with it, but I can tell you how to reply/upload in a
general way.

  Assuming you're logging on, capturing messages of interest, logging off and
reading them, what you.would do when you see a message you'd like to respond to
is this :

  Using an editor of some type or another (even Build is o.k.), for the first
line of the reply, enter 're' (or rep), a space, and the msg. nu ber you're
replying to.  The first line of this msg is 're 3848'.

  Type your reply/question/message.

  Type '/ex' or '/exit' in column #1 after your last line.

  Type 's' to store the message and let CIS rtformat it, 'su' to store it
exactly as you typed it, or 'pre' to preview it before it's stored either
formatted or unformatted.

  When you've got all your replies ready to go, log back in and at the forum
prompt '!', simply transmit each reply to CIS (CIS doesn't know that you're not
typing from the keyboard).  Be sure to use the ASCII transfer option.

  To upload to any of the libraries, go to the LIB you want to place your file
into and at the prompt type 'upl', and CIS will prompt you for the filename
which you then transmit. Next it'll ask you for KEYWORDS, a long description,
and I believe, a short description.

  Much harder to describe than actually do!

  There's a program in DL10 called 'View.ar' that I'm using now which allows
you to read your message file, print/save individual msgs., and reply to them
in a relatively simple fashion.

  Hope I've helped, but yell if anything's not clear.

Plain Rap for the Coco users. I think Plain Rap is about seven year old. That

Butch, do you live in the area (southern California) ? I have never called
plain rap, but since Paul is down, I'll probably be using it regularly. Yeah,
Paul was very helpful to me. I'm using his rs232pak and 2400 bd modem now.
These are just temporary though. I have a disto rs232 on the way. The reason
Paul isn't getting his bbs running is because GTE wants big bucks to run
another phone line in at his new residence. I can understand his point of view.
Are you new on CIS. I don't remember seeing your name before. I've been on over

More late night revelations... After working on my system for what seemed
endless hours, Dynacal finally camu up with the colors I selected. I think I
may not have had all the files it neede in my /r0/cmds directory. I know that
dcalc and dcalc.trm were there but when I first clicked on th icon I
encountered the previous problems. The 216 error/device not found was due to an
old aif that I  was experimenting with that had a cd /h0/main/dynacalc for the
parameter line. I guess i'll just have to change directorys through dcalc once
it is running. I hate it when I fix one of these wierd os9 quirks and I don't
know what caused it

Thanx for the help. Later.......................................... TC

Hi Scott!

     Pete's reply to you was correct except Fred's on board connector is just a
6 pin connector with pin 2 used as an index.  My connections are as follows:

     PT          PT          Modem
     BD         DB-25        DB-25

      1  ----->   8   ----->    8
      2 (not used - index)
      3  ----->   7   ----->    7
      4  ----->  20   ----->   20
      5  ----->   3   ----->    2
      6  ----->   2   ----->    3

You also may want to try jumpering as Pete suggested (if you do, disconnect the
wire going back to the PT BD).


     I suspect you may also have another problem which I forgot about. Fred's
device drivers 'ain't' the best in the world.  Originally, I could get no echo
from the modem.  (Ever try to use kermit blind - lot's of fun).  I assume
you're using OSK 3.3 (I'm still mostly 3.2 with a coupld of 3.3 modules).  Do
you have an sc68681 driver for Term (or T1) and T2 and a sc68681a driver for T2
and T3?

     I have a single driver for all four ports. It is a hacked version 15 - the
crc is 209711.  I got this from Simmy Turner.  I'll ask him if its OK to send
it to you (his stuff, you know).

J,

Why are you so sure there's a problem with Shell+ and your repak utility?

About the only problems I've run into with Shell+ is in the wildcard stuff.
Things can get real hairy if the utility you're running has it own wildcard
routines.

Best bet is to diable shell+'s wildcards and let the utlitiy cope as written.

David:
    All you need to do is link to the init module (C library function
modlink(), page 4-153 in the C Compiler User Manual), and define a struct based
on the structure of the init module (see /dd/sysmods/init.a) and cast the
result from modlink("init",0) to a pointer to this structure and then you can
access any field in the init module.  Modlink() returns the very beginning of
the module, so be sure to include a mod_exec struct (or equivelant) in the
start of the init module struct definition.

Tony - the SC-II manual I think shows a pin at one corner of the board ( near
to the coco)... the rs232 port plugs into it, as this is the IRQ/CART pin. So
that's also where you could run the irqhack from if you wished.

If you have the diode hack (and it works for you) then you needn't worry.

I put the diode in and I think it was ok. I had some other hardware problems
that made me think I had rs232 problems. But one day when I turned on my coco3
and all I got was garbage and could not reset the computer, I lifted up one end
of the diode and the garbage went away. I bought the diode at RS. Maybe their
parts are inferior or not up to spec. I heard that the diode hack did not work
on ALL coco3's. Paul Pollocks computer locked up or something when he put it
in. I still have one diode left and i'm running a completey new machine ($129),
so maybe i'll fire up my soldering iron after breakfast and try the diode hak
again.

I am occasionally getting the incorrect time from my disto clock module when I
start up shells in windows that I open from startup. The year usually comes up
as 93, the rest of the date and time is ok. But when I time date,t SOMETIMES i
get ?????, and the time. I had this problem before. It comes and goes. Maybe I
should have thought twice before I ordered the SCII and rs232 ? TC

Hmm... if you bought a pack of diodes from RS, they might indeed be bad. We
found that was true with most of their transistor packs, for example.
Individual units should be okay, tho.

Some people get that time problem.. and durn it, someone else once mentioned a
possible fix or reason for it.... but I can't remember it! Anybody?

I talked to you about this problem awhile back. Maybe you forgot that it was
me. I just put in the diode on this new machine. Sso far it seems to work.
Please let me know if you hear more about that fix for the Disto clock. I don't
think Tony is interested with system related problems, however if you port is
bad he will fix it or test it (CRC will), but I don't think I would get much
help from him regarding a software oriented problem (if that is what it is).

You can use the I$GetStt SS.JOY function documented in the Tech Ref manual,
page 8-116. You'll have to call it with the _os9() C library function.
