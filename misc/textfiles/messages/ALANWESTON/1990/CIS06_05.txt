Thanks for both of your replies.  The first is just what I needed.
I was able to read the M$OS9Lvl in the INIT module.
Actually M$OS9Lvl is a 4 byte value which holds lvl.ver.ver.rev
For example on my system OSK v2.2 is reads 1220 For Level I ver 2.2 rev 0

David,
The way I have always used memory modules is to have the structure defining
its contents separate from the (already exisiting) structure for the module.

 
#include <module.h>


 
 
mod_exec *modlink(), *mod_ptr;
struct foo *foobar;
 
      mod_ptr = modlink("init",0);
      tmp = (char *) mod_ptr + mod_ptr->_mexec;
      foobar = (struct foo *) tmp;

 
 
This will give you a pointer to the data area of the init module, which you
can acces with the structure you define after looking at init.a. This wil
be more "general" than defining a structure that includes all the module
header bologna.

I downloaded LOGIN.AR a while ago, and have a few questions that need some
answers that I can't find.

The AR file is l*o*n*g on programs, but very short on information on how to set
up a remote terminal. Is there a file in the libs that explains in a
step-by-step manner how to go about setting this up?

I'd like to connect the PCjr upstairs to the CoCo; from what I understand at
this point, I need to cable the CoCo RS232 output to the parallel port on the
jr and have a terminal program running on the jr.  Is this a correct assumption
on my part?  What else do I need to do?

  When you log on and get to a point where you want to start 'reading'
messages, open your capture buffer and start reading nmn-stop. (You can set
your options at the top of the forum to read messages non-stop.)
  When you're done, log off, close your capture buffer, and either quit your
terminal program or switch screens.

  Now, call View using the filename that you saved the messages in: for example
if you called your message file for today txt0527, you would type
       OS9:View txt0527

The program will ask you if you want to use multip e save files, search for a
text string, and then proceed to display the messages one at a time.  You can
(F)ile them, (P)rint them, read the (N)ext one, (R)eply or (Q)uit.

  Read the doc file in the ar and if you have more questions after that, give a
shout.

  I average about 2 mins or less per day on-line @ 2400 baud (any more and my
wife would kill me!) for reading new messages and any replies that I transmit.

Tony,
 If you have no assembly experience then I can see that you might have a bit of
trouble figuring out an _os9() call.  Here's the source of a function that will
read the joystick status:

 #include <os9.h>

 _gs_joy(path,joy,but,x,y)

 int path,joy,*but,*x,*y;

 {
      struct registers r;

      r.rg_a=path;
      r.rg_b=SS_JOY;
      r.rg_x=joy;
      if(_os9(I_GETSTT,&r)==-1)
           return -1;
      *but=(int)r.rg_a;
      *x=r.rg_x;
      *y=r.rg_y;
      return 0;
 }

The parameters are:

  path = path number to a window or to term.  Be sure not to pass a FILE
         pointer.  ie use fileno(stdin) and not stdin here.
  joy  = 0 for right joystick. 1 for left joystick.
  but  = pointer to an integer to receive the button status.  Returns:
         0 for none, 1 for button 1 down, 2 for button 2 down, 3 for both
         buttons down
         x   =x value (0 to 63)
         y   = y value (0 to 63)

OS-9 assembly language is no big deal; all you have to do is remember the
following:

1. position-independent, re-entrant code (too bad the folks at Sierra didn't
remember this one)

2. the operating system gives you memory (paste a copy of the diagram that
appears with F$Fork by your monitor, to make it easy to recall how to get to

I didn't misunderstand you, I realized you were asking about C and not
assembler. Its just that even though C has a very rivh function library, there
are many things OS9 can do which are covered with specific function calls.
That's the purpose of the _os9() function. Check it out on page 3-26 in the
Microware C manual. It serves the same purpose as BASIC09's SYSCALL function.
(well, similar). The _os9() function gives you the ability to make all the
Getstat and Setstat calls in the OS9 tech ref which are not covered by a
function in the function library.

Also, note in the example code which was posted has a syntax error. A return
statement which is intended to return a value must have the value enclosed in
parentheses, ie, return(-1);

Zack

Oh yes, all those $$$ in a assembler listing is probably references to base 16
numbers. $20 is decimal 32, etc.

I think that it is a bit too strong to say that the use of parentheses with a
return statement is K&R standard.  It IS a common style.  I broke myself of the
habit because I tended to type 'return()' when no value was to be returned. 
The COCO compiler chokes on this.  It can be argued that using parentheses is
undesirable since it makes the return statement look like a function call,
which it isn't.  On the other hand, the parentheses can make the code read more
clearly, especially within a complex line of code. In the end it is a matter of
style and personal preference.

I don't think is strong at all to say that it is the K&R standard. After all,
if you look on page 68 and 70 of K&R, you'll plainly see that the format of the
return statement is "return(expression)". On page 68, the book goes on to say,
that the main purpose of the return statement is not to simply return to the
caller but to return a value to the caller, but if no value is expected by the
caller, then no expression is needed at all, in which case the returned value
is garbage. It doesn't mention it, but the "accepted" standard for that form of
the return statement is sio simply "return" with no parentheses at all.

Admittedly, in the appendix on page 203, the return statement is described with
it's expression not enclosed in quotes, so there is some ambiguity, but I
disagree that it "is common style". I have seen a lot of C code on several
different platforms in the past few years, and NOWHERE have I seen the return
statement used to pass a value without the parentheses. It may be YOUR common
style, but it not EVERYBODY'S common style.

But, since the compiler apparently accepts it inthe format which you describe,
then the usage of parentheses is a matter of personal preference, but I don't
recommend it's use, as other compilers may croak. I don't have a copy of the
second printing of K&R (based on the ANSi standard) so I'm not sure if the
current standard requires the () or not.

Trust me--although K&R in the body of K&R 1st edition always parenthesize the
expressions they use in return statements, the appendix was as near to a
standard as existed pre-X3J11, and it just says expression.  Since a
parenthesized expression is an expression, it's just as acceptable
syntactically, though some may argue on stylistic grounds one way or another.

The ANSI standard simply says expression, so neither it nor K&R *require*
parentheses.

I have no way of knowing for sure, but...I bet that the K&R 1st edition
practice (adding redundant parentheses) may have arisen under the influence of
PL/I, which *does* insist on the parentheses in RETURN statements.

After spending a long time influenced by the style of K&R 1st edition, I have
moved over to the point of view that argues that return(expression) looks too
much like a function call, so I omit those redundant parentheses. (I use
redundant parentheses freely to avoid playing more-macho-than-thou games
involving detailed knowledge of the umpteen, often counterintuitive, levels of
precedence of the various operators of C.)

James, I'm glad to see a PROFESSIONAL programmer who agrees with me that C
precedence is impossible to remember.  In Boolean expressions I write C like
"infix LISP."

I also use return(expr) since "return expr" looks too sleezy (as in BASIC).

Zack,
     Of the three books on C in my library, Purdum always uses parentheses,
Gehani never does and Hogan says they're not required but that many use them
for clarity.  There is a diversity in this usage and I would say that any
compiler that required parentheses with return is definitly non-standard.  It
is a question of style and I think the most compelling argument is Occam's
Razor--why hit the shift key if you don't need to. Still I think a line like:

 return (strcmp(s1,s2)==1) ? s1 : s2;

does benefit by being written

 return((strcmp(s1,s2)==1) ? s1 : s2);

although the two do compile the same.

Oh, you have done some assembly work.  Those '$' as in 'os9 I$Write' are op
system calls which translate as 'SWI   ;FCB code' in standard 6809 assembler. 
'I$Write' is a symbol defined in os9defs and is equal to the system call code. 
What you do is load up the registers CPU with the appropriate values as
documented in the tech manual, execute the sys call with the 'os9' psuedo op,
the op system does what it does and then returns to calling program with the
CPU registers modified as documented.  The C function _os9(code,reg) loads the
registers with the values contained in the structure pointed to by reg and then
calls the system call specified by code.  The structure for the register values
and symbols for the sys call codes are defined in os9.h.  You ought to list
os9.h and have a look at it.  This should make things clearer.

SS.JOY is a "getstat" call. Getstat is a generic call to ask for various status
type information for various IO devices. To determine which information is
being requested getstat requries a "function code". In this case function code
$13 tells getstat that it is a SS.JOY call. Call me and I'll be gald (whoops,
that's glad!) to discuss it with you, voice.

Actually, the only similarity between my game and Gauntelet is the basic theme
of running around mazes while you have a bird's eye view.  As far as setting up
the proper screen to run the game in, type this at an OS9 prompt:
   wcreate /w2 -s=8 0 0 40 24 1 0 0 ; depths <>>>/w2& You may have to use a
different window that /w2.  Have fun!

Frank - if you do redo the TC70 announcement, you might want to correct
something (assuming I'm right):

I don't think the 070 will go 19Mhz... that may be the external frequency
input, but that's divided by two to get the true cpu clock, you see. So that
should probably be 9.5Mhz instead. That would reflect the normal 68K clock
speed value used in computer specifications.

Yeah, with the actual clock speed of the TC70 running at about 9 MHz, and with
video chip/CPU contention over memory, I'd be surprised if the TC70 would
greatly outperfrom a CoCo 3. Not bad for a $1000 machine ....

Mike - yikes, didn't meant to start anything. But to answer your question, no,
the 070 on their MM/1 uses a 30Mhz clock... which divided by two gives the
15Mhz speed.

Note that it's only with the 68070 that you have to do this divide... it's a
chip with a cpu, timer, serial and other stuff, y'see. If you see "16Mhz 68020"
for example, then it means 16Mhz.

No, Mike, the CLOCK is 30 MHz, which is divided by two to get the 15 MHz speed.

Actually, a full MM/1 system with the CPU board and I/O board runs at around
1000 Drystones, while an Amiga (according to the Dhrystone ratings I have here)
runs around 350 Dhrystones. That seems too slow to be real, but I guess the
Amiga has no choice but to share memory with the graphics chips, causing the
CPU to wait.

Does that reflect the truth, Kevin Darling? Does this mean that an MM/1 will be
up to 2.5 times faster than an Amiga?

I have no idea. Is it the same Dhrystone? You have to be careful... there are
several versions out there.

The only thing to do is to run the same program, under OSK on both the Amiga
and the MM/1 (and the ST, and the PT, etc etc). That way everything is fair.

Hmm. Of course, if you know it's the same D version, then we can compare it
with the amiga, as long as we realize that benchmarks are just general
comparisons. And you'd have to compare a fat amiga with fast ram, to an mm/1
with the extra fast ram installed. Etc.

It'll definitely be faster than a stock amiga, yes. How much faster depends on
amount of fast and/or video ram, and video resolution (if running from shared
video ram, mm/1 should be faster).

Kev,

I DO know that it is the SAME Dhrystone program. It came on the PT 68K that
Pease sent to me, and its the same Dhrystone that Pease ran on his CoCo that
ran about 270 Ds under Level 2.

Of course, a 270 D CoCo 3 is FAR more productive than a 5000 D super IBM
thingie. So Drhystone is not really meaningful in terms of sheer productivity.

Yeah, according to the DStone docs I had, the SAME program was compiled and run
on the Amiga. Which compiler, I do not know.

A base case MM/1 runs about twice as fast as an Amiga on most things. Peak
performance is three times as fast on most things.

At least according the the DStone stuff.

THere are some differences in the 68070 execution speeds and 68000 exec speeds.
The 070 has a little overhead. So a 15 MHz 68070 runs like a 13 Mhz 68000 -- of
course our graphics chip helps out alot, and DMA is especially nice in
improving the feel of the computer. It does scream, even when we exercise a
complicated graphics demo in another window.

One demo was flipping through ten pictures as fast as they could load into
buffers from ram disk, while we ran Procs and formatted a floppy and did
several other things. Even on a floppy-only system, we still had EXCELLENT
responsiveness. The floppies transfer data twice as fast as a CoCo, and with
DMA, to a Dir command executed concurrently with all that above stuff is pretty
darn smooth.

Good idea! Realstones and Khornerstones seem to make certain sense.

Of course,t he DStone I was using actually documented quite a few computers
that had run exactly the same version, so we could compare the MM/1 against
hundreds of other computers. Faster that some PDP mainframes, btw.

The Rhealstone also runs through the OS rather than on top of it, so it is not
a separate process.  The benchmark also has a strict reporting standard to
discourage "accidental" cheating. The weighting report allows one computer to
do well in some areas while another does well in other areas.  This will cut
down the bragging, but customers will appreciate unbiased information.

Talk about mud slinging... Michael Haaland (sp) sure tossed some wet, sloppy
ones in that 'press release' file-type thing... The MM/1's interlace 'flicker'
is every bit as good as the Amiga's, it has to be, that's an NTSC standard,
like you see on your tv. I heard that he compared them using a long-persistance
monitor on the MM/1... maybe if he used a Microway FlickerFixer or an A3000
with a multisync monitor, he might not have noticed the Amiga's flicker at
all... but that's just speculating. Potential MM/1 buyers should NOT worry at
all about the 'flicker'. Consider... Mac users pay extra money to get their
computers to 'flicker'. <grin>              --Eet--

Ah good, you beat me to it <grin>. Yes, hey Paul! Better yank out that bit
about interlace flicker being less on the MM/1 than on the Amiga. _Any_
computer with interlace will flicker some, depending on picture content and
monitor being used. Computer type doesn't matter.

Kev,

Promptly yanked out! The release is now a rerelease -- sans the Amiga comment!

However, for the record, I have had a fair amount of contact with the Amiga and
with the MM/1 -- I still see LESS flicker on the MM/1 -- so the diff must be in
the monitor used or in the particular graphics pictures I have had the luck to
see.

And Mr. Haaland saw quite a few interlace pics at the Fest, and agreed with all
of us that it was quite a stable pict

So, OK, sorry I goofed, but it was an honest mistake.

Well, the MM/1 has RGB analog video, right? Which means I (and others) could
use an Amiga 1084 monitor with it (among others)... and if they get an MM/1
(oops, MILLENIUM :) after hearing/reading that it's got less/no flicker, and
then it flickers the same amount... well, you don't want to face that problem,
do you? <grin> Didn't want to start an RWar, just didn't want people phreaking
later when the lace on the Millenium is noticed.  --Eet--

Jim,

Actually, both Mike and I looked at the SAME interlace pictures at the
Rainbowfest, and Kevin Pease (our designer) agreed with us that it seemed to
flicker less than the Amiga.

Since I posted that press release, we have learned that, theoretically, there
should be no difference. I guess we have all been unlucky enough to have been
viewing interlace pictures that don't flicker alot because of the colors they
use.

Wrists are slapped. I apologize -- although this is an honest mistake -we've
just been going on what our eyes have told us!

Flicker is a function of persistance. Interlace displays have a high
persistance, noninterlace have a low one. If you want to do high speed graphics
you need a low persistance.

Mark,

Thanks -- I think I've learned my lesson on this one! The converse is that low
speed graphics (interlace mode) requires the persistence that apparently OUR
monitors had, compared to the Amiga monitors I have seen.

Although I actually thought that most of those Amiga monitors were functionally
equivalent to the Magnavox 85CM15 I've been using on the MM/1.

Don't blame you. I'm using an interlaced display right now on my Amiga, very,

My concern is that horizxontal lines only one pixel high, on a contrasting
background, will flicker.  Music staves, ya know. If I draw them double height,
then flicker will be less, but then might as well not use the doubled interlace
resolution at all. I saw lots of those pix at the Fest too, and flicker was
noticeable if you looked for it when each picture first came up.  But "natural"
pix don't have the contrast that sharp horizontal lines do.

Any CAD/CAM types here want to comment?

And even if the computers were identical, there are issues of support,

~
TONY;

   There is a 'trick' to using the RS-OS9 version 1.0 of DYNACALC.

   The manual would have you believe that the file dynacalc.trm should be
in  your current DATA directory.  A much easier way to run DynaCalc is to
set  the  execution  attribute and place the file  dynacalc.trm  in  your
EXECUTION directory.  

   You see DynaCalc looks for dynacalc.trm in your current DATA directory
FIRST.   Then  if  not  found in the DATA directory,  it  looks  in  your
EXECUTION directory LAST.  If not found in either it errors out.

   This  function of DynaCalc is internal to DynaCalc and doesn't  matter
whether you are using the STOCK SHELL or SHELL+.  (I'm using SHELL+)

   With  dynacalc.trm  in your EXECUTION directory you may  run  DynaCalc
anywhere  on your HD tree, with an AIF or otherwise, provided the  target
file has the '.cal' extension.

   Using  a name of 'AIF.cal' for your aif file name will further enhance
your ability to run all of your files automatically while in Multi-Vue.

Best,


Mike

If I may jump in here, it is my impression that you can (read should) only have
ONE aif per directory with the same three character extension. Actually, all
AIFs on the same disk are "cached" as long as you don't select a new disk (or
the same disk by clicking on the disk icon). First one found has precedence.

What Mike may have meant was that if you save your Dynacalc spreadsheet files
with a .cal extension (which may or may not be the default, I don't reqa really
use it all that much), then after you have "been" to a subdirectory with an
AIF.cal in it, then all files which have a .cal exstention also will show up as
icons, and if you double click on one it will call up the program specified
with the AIF and automagically supply the filename as the command line
parameter. Make sense?

$800 sounds pretty cheap for an Amiga 500.  I guess that's a monochrome monitor
setup.  But yes, the Amiga is considered expensive relative to ST (tho probably
not for "comparable systems"). Of course as you point out, everything is a
bargain next to MacPrices.

Wow -- all that for $850?  Sheesh, a color ST costs at least that. Is that

Mike,

Currently 1 meg of DRAM in DIP packaging is on the CPU board. The I/) (I/O
rather) board has 2 SIMM sockets, meaning that, for VERY LITTLE MONEY, you can
have a 3 meg system by adding 2  one meg simms.

These SIMMS cost about $150 for 2 meg.

Makes you wonder why you just bouth that one meg upgrade, eh?

I insatlled the diode hack two days ago, and I lost the carrier while logged on
here. Don't know if it was the phone line or rs232 problems.

Wwant to hear some really wierd problems ? I tried to modify my startup file
 and copying all my files to it. Well when  I put in a goto no_format label in
the startup file it bombed out while trying to start up a shell in /w7 . Wwhen
I removed the goto and the label, it executed normally. On top of that, when I
did an mdir, my modules that I  had merged with the shell were in memory in
reverse alphabetical order ! When I merged them I started out with shell attr
copy del  etc...  I even did did an ident on the merged shell file to verify
this. Got an answer for those ?

This one really grinds at me ... I opened up the gclock from MV and tried to
set the date and time because they were wrong. No matter how I entered the date
and time , It responded with illegal entry. I finally had to close gclock.

I am tired of fightting these elusive problems and not getting anywhere. I
wonder, would not using the right scf module for gshell1.24A cause ANY of the
above problems. With all the numerous patches around (no I did not keep a log
of my changes) I think I may be using some modules t that were intended for
gshell 1.24 with 1.24A. I remember reading that there was two or three version
of the scf module, and one had mentioned your name.

Also I could not get the wilcard expansion to work for shell2.0 . Aafter
reading the doc file a few times, I finally tried the wild card feature out. I
typed :fstat *, and it showed the stats for all files in the directory. Then I
typed :attr * , and it only returne the attr's for one file. I tried it with
dir as well but got another strange response. Wwhen does it all end.

Is there anyone who is willing to spend a little time and help me nail down
these problems ????

Heh-heh, you should see the troubles people have on other machine forums ;-). I
don't think the world has gotten to a user-friendly computer stage quite yet,
eh? Ah well, someday.

Yeah, modules sometimes go in the module dir in reverse order. Guess we should
find out why, just for curiousity's sake.

Dunno what format gclock expects time in... something like "11:03pm" or
something? Anyone recall? Is it in the manual?

Your wildcard problems are because many commands won't accept more than one
filename as a parameter. As time goes by (and now that we have wildcards),
people are writing replacements that do.

Easy enough to tell for now; just try it by hand ("dir /d0 /d1", etc) and see
if that particular command works.

Everything makes sense. Just gotta figure it out slowly. After all, it's

I have a question regarding C.  In reading a book I have on the language, I
found that there is a global variable errno that contains the latest error
result.  As a result of this, I am led to believe that error trapping in C
(run-time error trapping) is possible as it is for other languages, such as
Basic09.  In a program I wrote, a division by zero error resulted in my
returning back to OS9 with an error message - is there any way to get C to
recognize the error before it happens and avoid going back to OS9, but handle
the error in the way I see best?  such as the onerror command in Basic09...

Actually, that depends on how the internal math functions were written. If they
do the equivalent of this:

    if((param1/param2) == ERRDIV)
        exit(ERRDIV)

then there's no way to trap it. If the function you used RETURNS an error value
(the usual 'C' way of doing things) either explicitly (unlikely) or by
returning a -1, and then letting you examine 'errno', you can do as you like
with it. We'd probably have to see the program fragment to get more specific.

Dan,
 Yes, there is a way to trap math errors in C.  You have to set up a signal
trapping function with the intercept() function.  When an error occurs the
signal trap is called.  Usually, the signal trap simply sets an appropriate
flag and returns.  The main program must check the flag at the appropriate time
to see if an error has occurred and then take some action.

You sure about that? Example: failure to pass a valid filename to the fopen()

Pete,
 You're right that the library functions usually give an error indication with
the returned value.  However, an error condition which happens during a math
operation, division by zero, floating point overflow ect., causes the code to
send a signal to itself.  You must capture this signal with an intercept
routine or the process will return to the shell with an error message.

OK--there are errors and there are errors.  For instance--if you're on a 68020
and using a 68881, an attempt to divide by zero will blow you off with an
exception from the coprocessor.  Other errors are caught by defensive coding in
library routines and result in setting errno and returning some special value
(e.g. EOF from getc()).  Software floating-point behavior depends on how the
stuff is written, of course.

For division by zero, I fear that the best way to catch the problem is to test
the divisor before you divide.  (Alas, that won't catch overflow.) Different
routines handle errors differently, is about all I can say--read the docs
carefully.

Yep... the messages (#3413 and #3414 - about C arrays) are FROM you and TO you.
You've evidentally got your READ OPTIONS set so that you ignore messages sent

Sb: #C file buffering
Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

Here's my next "dumb" question. It has to do with the way 'C' buffers files. If
I understand things correctly all the "proper" file stuff (fopen, fputs, etc.)
use buffered i/o. Of course, this presents problems for terminal i/o. For
example, if you wish to print a line without a CR; or if you use functions like
CurXY()...

This problem can be overcome by using setbuff() so that the i/o is done on a
un-buffered basis. But then, if you want to print a long line it will be done
with a whole series of system calls. I think this would really slow things down
if there was to be a lot of terminal i/o.

So, is there a way to get the best of both worlds. Would something like this
work:

    leave file as buffered,
    if doing cursor pos, etc. flush the file,
    if printing a line with a CR, flush the file,

Or is this needlessly complex. Also, what happens if you just want to get 1 or
2 characters from the keyboard. Will fflush() work here too?

Seems that the simplest thing to do is to forget about buffered files
completely and handle it using the unix-like functions. But the more I read the
more I think this is not the 'best" solution.

So, what thoughts do you have on this...

Yes, what you suggest (for output) would work, i.e. using explicit fflush()
where you want to force it out.  Just getting one or two characters from
buffered input?  I guess I'm not sure what you mean.  stdio isn't really
designed for switching back and forth between buffered and unbuffered (though
you can certainly do it via setbuf()).  Could you explain what you're after in
more detail?

Okay, here is what I have done. I've written an input routine with editing
(delete, insert, etc.). It's quite simple to use--you just pass it a string to
edit, and the input/output fileptrs. It works just fine, so long as both
streams are set for single character (unbuffered) mode. This limits the use of
the routine. I would like the routine itself to set up the proper mode
(probably with setbuf()), do its thing, and then restore things. It just
occurred to me that I could open an duplicate path via I$DUP (hmmm, isn't there
a standard library function too?), and set that path up as I need it. I guess I
would still have to flush the output buffer before doing this but the input
buffer should be okay. Guess I should just try it...

That's really on the nose. I believe CR terminated lines will self-flush, but
other than that, you're on target.

You shouldn't have to do that with input, though. If you are consistantly just
getting a few chars from the keyboard (i.e. menu selections, etc.), why not use
read(0,&c,1) vice using buffered I/O?

Yeah, I could use read()...but I understand that "proper" C protocol is to
avoid using unbuffered, unix-like, i/o. But skipping the buffered i/o
completely certainly has advantages for terminal routines. Guess one has to
decide between what works well and what is "the right way."

I my opinion, what is "proper" C protocol is what works for you for your
specific needs. I frequently use unbuffered IO (read() and write()) with
terminal IO, and it seems to perform quite well.

Bob,

I have heard mention of read() and write() not being kosher, mostly because
there are compilers out there that don't support them (MS-DOS types I think). I
wouldn't worry about sticking with fread() and fwrite() though.  The low-level
I/O functions are much faster in my judgement.

One thing you should watch out for when using setbuf(), if you setbuf()
standard output to 0 (single character I/O), it doesn't really matter which
function (fwrite() or write()) you use...it will be slow as all get out.
Setting standard input to single character I/O makes it easier to read a single
keypress, and still allows you to read in entire lines of text without changing
anything.  But, you can't use ungetc() if you need to.

For serious editing, or just about anything more involved than using the built
in line edit OS9 provides, it is usually a good practise to null out the device
descriptor for the terminal and work with each character itself without having
to worry about people having different xmode settings.  It takes a bit more
work, but eliminates lots of headaches.  If you also then use read() and
write() to the terminal, you'll get nice and fast screen updating.

Bob, it's best to do output buffered, and one-key-at-a-time (no ENTER) input as
unbuffered.  You can get the corresponding "raw" (Unix-ese) channel number as
"stdin->_fileno" or something close -- look in stdio.h to be sure. Just be sure
that whenever you do unbufeered I/O on the same path as buffered, always
fflush() the path first.

Also you can set buffered output so it WILL NOT turn CRs and LFs bytes into
CR-LF pairs.  Do stdout->_flag |= _RBF.

Ask for more details if needed.  Don't use setbuf(). But use fprintf(stderr,
...) if you want instant output quick.

(some nasty ones), missing many features that should really be in a package

You can sequentially read an RBF file, of course...for SCF it doesn't make
sense to talk about seeking to the end!  The simplest way to do what you want
is via the SS_SIZE getstat call, which will tell you the current file length.
Once you have that, seek to that position, and you're all set.  (If you're
using C and have Carl Kreider's library, look in the docs for _gs_size().)

Just do a getstt to determine the file's size, and then do an I$seek to that
point. If you're working in C, it's wayyyy easier: just open the file for
append (i.e. fopen("filename", "a").

 DIM register:regs
 DIM callcode:BYTE
 DIM xconv,uconv:REAL

 OPEN #path,filenam:UPDATE

 RUN syscall(callcode,register)

 IF xconv<0 THEN xconv=xconv+65536. \ ENDIF 
 uconv=register.u
 IF uconv<0 THEN uconv=uconv+65536. \ ENDIF

 SEEK #path,fsize
 RETURN 
 80 (* Need to create initial file

My mistake on the name; I'm sure ss.siz is what you want.  OK--here's the poop
on syscall:

syscall is a direct hook to OS-9 system calls.  If you take a gander at the
Technical Manual, you'll see that the interface to the system calls is defined
in terms of what the registers of the 6809 contain when you make the call and
what they contain when the kernel gets back to you, right?  OK--the interface
for the BASIC09 procedure syscall (and, for that matter, the C routine _os9())
is defined the same way--there's a TYPE statement that you should use that has
fields defined that correspond precisely to the registers of the 6809, and you
assign to the appropriate fields what you want to hand to the system call in
accordance with the input parameters specified in the manual page for that
system call.  After the procedure is run, the variable you passed as a
parameter has its fields modified to reflect exactly what comes back from the
system call. The fields that correspond to the registers contain just what the
registers had in them coming back from the system call.

In this particular case, you have to do something perhaps a little
counterintuitive, because the length of a file can be up to 2**32 bytes, which
is too big to fit in a BASIC09 INTEGER variable.  The length comes back from
the system call with the least-significant 16 bits in one register, and the
mostsignificant 16 bits in another.  To get the right length, you need to do
something like "65536.0*regs.x+regs.y" to force the calculation to be done in
floating-point arithmetic.  So you'd say "SEEK #path,65536.0*regs.x+regs.y" to
get to the end of the file open on path.

There should be a tutorial that gives all the gory details of syscall, probably
better than I've done here, and probably with examples, which I'd say would be
very appropriate at this point.  Wander over to the DL areas and browse--or
maybe someone here will pipe up with the proper file name and area (eh eh,
nudge nudge! :-).

~ Phil;

  The subroutine that I sent you got a bit munged - the DIM line for xconv and
uconv should have read :
  DIM xconv,uconv:REAL

  Other than that, it came through O.K.

 re: syscall tutorial
  Look in LIB 1, I believe (tutorials) for either SYSCAL.TXT or SYSCAL.DOC with
Kev's PPN on it.

Phil -

There seem to be a few conceptual problems here as well. RBF type files are the
only files that you _can_ seek to the end of (disk files).... SCF (/term, /p,
etc.) type files HAVE NO EOF, until you present an EOF character to them, which
usually closes the path. Same goes for pipes. SS.siz, SS.size -probably just
typos.

partial ordering and the algorithm "topological sort;" it should be easy to

Help? I just got my Disto SCII w/RS232 & HD options. The no halt mode seems to
work ok, but I am harving trouble with the serial port. My system is setup ass
follows, Aa modified MPI, COCO3 w 512k, Disto 512k ramd disk in SLOT 2, B&B
host adapter/controller in SLOT3, Disto SCII with RS232 & HD in slot 4. I
patched aciapak with the modpatch file that came with the Disto stuff and I am
using THEIR /T2 descriptor too! I could dial my modem (RS 1200 BAUD), but it
didn't use my osterm scripts, and then it just hung the whole system and left
my hard drive selected. Oh, by the way I have put in the diode hak a week ago.
Everything has been working ok since then, I even had reliable rs232. To get 
this message to you, I had to pull out the SCII (powered off) and put my old
controller in and Tandy RS232. This time everything flew. What did I do wrong ?
Oh, one more thing, I am using the cc3disk.irq driver as specified in the
readme file included. I used cc3disk.slp at first, but when I read that I
should use the IRQ version if I was using the RS232 option INSIDE the SCII.
What I don't know is if the Disto Ramdisk is using interrupts, or the B&B for
that matter. TC

Tony,

Lessee. No the ramdisk doesn't use interrupts, and neither does the B&B I don't
think.

Make sure that the /t2 descriptor has -pause. You were right to use the one
they gave.

Oh. I'm pretty sure OSTerm cheats and directly diddles the rs232 pak, which is
why things hang when using the Disto 2-1 card.

Others here may know the locations to patch in OSTerm (which shoulda taken the
cheat address from the descriptor, anyway!).

Tell your friend that with prudent and efficient usage habits (as outlined in
at least one file here on the forum), CompuServe can be scoped out for just a
few (under 5 or 10) minutes a day. You logon, capture all messages nonstop, and
then use one of the offline tools ('view') to read and respond to messages.
Then you just upload the responses as text files later. Nothing to it.

The UUCP port is coming along nicely, but there is still some work to do on it
before it can be released.  This is about as complicated a package as I would
like to tackle in a long time (whew!).  As with all software development, you
are tempted to keep adding features and never get it done. So far, only a
couple utilities need to be completed, and the tranfer protocol needs a little
tweeking.

I'll probably be making a call for beta testers later this month, so tell your

To: William Phelps 75100,265

William,

Shouldn't be too hard to read a track.  All you need to do is open the entire
disk as a file, and then seek to the track you want and read it.  You'll need
to calculate the size of each track in bytes and use that figure for seeking
and reading.  For example; a CoCo OS9 360K floppy has 18 256 byte sectors per
track for 4608 bytes per track.  Open the disk as /d0@ and then seek to the
beginning of the file (the first sector), then seek out 4608 bytes.  This
should put you at the start of the second track.  Then read in 4608 bytes.

If you want to make your program smarter, then have it read the data from LSN0
on the size of things.  Look in the Level II manual page 5-2.  The number of
bytes per sector is not there, but I believe all OS9 systems use 256 bytes per
sector.

That's really reading a track's worth of sectors, not reading a track. That
incurs all the overhead of interrecord gaps, headers, and disk interleave.
Track reading generall eats that whole collection in one revolution, and
handles data deblocking internally. That's one reason why track caches make
things so fast.
