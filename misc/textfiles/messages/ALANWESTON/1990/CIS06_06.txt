Tony;

   Sorry for replying late .. I only get on here weekly.

   Zack's reply was right on the mark.  That is what I meant to say.  You
place an AIF file in your HD tree and it gets read throughout the system.
Because  DynaCalc  saves  its  files  with  a  '.cal'  extension  do  the
following. .

   Make  your  file AIF.cal and place it early in your tree.   Then  when
using Multi-Vue in other parts of your system, when MV comes upon the any
DynaCalc saved file with a '.cal' extension it refers back to the AIF.cal
file  and  loads  DynaCalc,  executes  it,  and  loads  the  '.cal'  file
automatically.

   I  didn't  say  RSDOS  version of Dynacalc.  I  said  RS-OS9.   In  my
previous message . .

>>>"There is a 'trick' to using the RS-OS9 version 1.0 of DYNACALC."<<<

   Thanks   for  helping Tony out.  You were right.  Your explanation  of
using    AIF's   and multiple files was correct, and that is what  I  did
intend to say.

   Go  to  Library 10 and download WINVDG.AR.  It is by Bruce  Isted  and
contains  windows W thru W15 descriptors which are full 80 column screens
and  also  includes V1 thru V7 which are VDG.  Also includes the  source.
You will need AR to 'de-archive' this file.

I'm having a problem with I-Code modules.  I'm working on a BBS and have the
most often used modules merged together and loaded into memory.  The other
modules I pull from disk when I need them.  After I use the module, I KILL it.
Using this method, I get no Module Not Found errors.  However, when I try to
call a module again that I previously called and KILLed, I get a memory full
error!  Why?

Pete,

I'm not sure about that (reading a track of sectors, including the interrecord
gap stuff).  Wouldn't this be much like reading 16K or so of data from a file
using read()?  You don't get anything there except for the file data.  I know
this is different because the disk was opened as a file, but I believe all the
disk bilge is eaten by the controller and never seen at the applications level.

Maybe I'm confusing the issue -- does this guy want only a tracks worth of data
or does he also want the inter-record stuff?

If you read the Western Digital 1793 data sheet, look at the READ TRACK
command. That 'bilge' as you refer to it is stripped off only when you perform
normal sector reads. Track read is effectively the converse of track write
(which is what FORMAT uses to put all the lowe level data on the disk.. gaps
track & sector headers, and sector templates.

I don't mean read every sector on a track.  I am talking about doing a raw read
of the complete track.

You can to a few things:

1) Use the SHELL command to invoke a TMODE QUIT=0 ABORT=0

2) Better but harder, use the SYSCALL subroutines to do
   an i$getstt of the path's options (SS.OPT), modify the
   affected bytes, and then set 'em back in place with a
   i$setstt command

3) Use ON ERROR routines to trap the key

Note that while in the interpretive (non packed) mode, the break key is always
enabled as a means of debugging the program, or stopping a runaway routine.

Thankyou James but I really do not have the time or the inclination to get into

You'd have to talk to the folks who own MacProject II, or persuade a programmer
to do something similar for the CoCo.  (Now, Paul Ward et al. are working on
porting, or having someone port, applications to OS-9/68K for the MM/1, and I'd
be surprised if a scheduling/project management package hadn't crossed his
mind, though of course you'd have to ask him whether anything is being done.
The only association I have with the folks making the MM/1 is that I've already
sent off my deposit on ordering one when they finally officially come out.)
