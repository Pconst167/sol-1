Kevin,

I've been trying to figure out how the new upload MicroEmacs works...with less
than overwhelming success. For instance: why does the program grab an 11k
buffer (according to PROCS) that's not initially reflected in the program's
internal buffer menu?

Correspondingly, why does UE max out internally at about 16k when PROCS says
more than 32k of buffer space is involved?

In the same vein, when I tear apart the UE code there's some mention of VIRTUAL
MEMORY. But, for the life of me I can't find any Virtual Memory involved. Of
course, I know less than nothing about Virtual Memory (grin).

Am I making any sense? Or, am I so far in over my head I'm not aware that I'm
drowning?

Wendell,

I'm just guessing, (I haven't had a chance to do anything with UE except
 try it out) but I suspect that UE requires 11K for its data area (OUCH!) prior
to setting up the text buffer area. This might also be a large stack
requirement which adds to the data area in a C program. It might be that the
program, being written for a machine with lots more memory available, had lots
of local variables (which require stack space), and it gets even worse if there
are recursive function calls. I have no idea what "virtual memory" in UE is, it
might mean spilling off to a temporary disk file when the memory buffer fills
up, but I doubt this version has that capability.

James:
    Probably you should break it up into logical sections:  the executable
modules, the DVI stuff organized by printer type, the fonts by style, inputs
and formats as separate pieces, etc.  Typically, people usually don't need to
download all of the DVI stuff, just what they need for their printer(s). The
bigest part is the font pixel files (.pk* I think).  This alone is close to 5
meg. The only thing I see doing here is break it up into managable pices in a
more or less arbituary fashion (i.e. 10 files of a .5 meg each or something). 
These files won't compress much (they are like binaries - the bits are too
"randomized" for the compression programs to get much of a handle on repeated
patterns.

Mark,

Last weekend, I spent ten hours using your hdbackup to backup hard disk. It is
a slick program. The fact that the files remain individually readable is a
great advantage.

I did run into one small hitch. At one of the "Insert next disk" prompts, I
bounced the return key. Of course, meant that when the current disk was full,
the program skipped through the next swap disks prompt without stopping.
Although I was able to continue the backup using ^S to stop the program and a
second terminal to build the needed directories on the new disk, I decided to
modify the code to eliminate the problem.

Actually I made two changes. Both are in swap_disk(). One deals with the double
RETURN problem which I had. The other gives the user the option of running a
shell command at each disk swap prompt. This latter change allows the user to
format disks, for example. I have tested my changes and think they may be
useful to others.

The changed code in swap_disk is in the following message. It replaces your
code up to "if (flag == FULL)". If it looks useful, you are free to include in
a future upgrade of hdbackup.

What does the trainer expect to see on the serial line?  If it's something
reasonable to have a human type, then the simplest hack would be to use a
terminal program to communicate with it.  (I'd be tempted to try that initially
just for the heck of it.)  If there's some sort of more complicated protocol
involved, you're likely to have to write a special program to do it.  Be sure
you have the number of data and stop bits right as well as the baud rate.

James,

Did you already have a /dd/sys/password file or where your relying on adduser
to create it?

Reason I ask is I think there is a small bug in either the library or the docs.
If you fopen() a file with the "a+" mode (open/create for read and write), and
that file does not already exist, then nothing is created.  In fact, it doesn't
return an error code either.

If this is what happend to you, just create a password file....you don't even
have to put anything into it.  I always had a password file on my disk so I
never saw this.  I'll change the code to create the file fisrt if it doesn't
exist.

To: John Millington 75170,153 (X)

OS-9 is a multitasking, multi-user operating system that was originally written
for the Motorola 6809 CPU, and later written for the 680xx family.  It is used
quite a bit in industrial and process control (ATMs, luggage sorting in
airports, assembly lines for brakes for Jaguars and for telephones, controlling
the Fairlight CMI) as well as in general-purpose computers (though in that area
probably less so in the US than abroad--prophet without honor and all that,
eh?).

OS-9 probably derives its interesting qualities from Motorola's one-time plans
for selling software on ROM for the 6809.  (See the three-part series BYTE ran
on the 6809 in the Jan-Mar 1979 issues--the first and last time they ever
devoted significant space to the 6809 :-(  Such software would be bought and
plugged into the system by the user, who could purchase whatever he or she
needed or wanted and plug it in any place in the address space of the
processor, so the code had to be (1) position-independent, (2) re-entrant
(since it was on ROM), and (3) recognizable by the system as code from powerup
as opposed to random stuff or even whatever the memory board handed back when
one referred to unoccupied space on the board!  These requirements, I think,
gave rise to the notion of the OS-9 module, and a lot of very nice consequences
resulted.

downloaded the file to my Force CPU-30 and want to put the file in my Atari ST

it work. The Force does not have a terminal of its own.  I am using a simple
com program on the Atari ST (via its /t1 port) as a terminal for the Force's
/TERM port.

What is the magic incantation to xfer a file with rz/sz using this arangement.
Do I have to drag out another terminal for the Force?  (it does have a couple
of additional serial ports available)  rz/sz seem to want to use stdin/stdout
for the xfer port.  I tried redirecting things, but then there is a chicken and
egg problem: how do I get sz started after I start rz on the Atari ST? or if I
start sz (on the Force) first, how do I tell it to wait until I fire up rz on
the Atari (with rz <>>>/t1)?  XModem is not a problem since it is
receiver-driven (one starts up the sender and it waits for NAK's, when the
receiver is started, it sends NAK's and things take off from there.  ZModem
seems to work differently...

Dan -

These calls are supported in the current release of the Kreider library. They
are documented in Unix manuals (section 3.. C Functions). The docs were
initially left out by mistake (from the Kreider libs). Mark Griffith can
probably get you a copy of that page, or if he can't, bug me and I will.

You can probably get a good bit of it from usage context. Basically, it's an
fopen() call for pipes using the specified command at the other end of the
pipe:

   FILE *woof;
   ...
   woof = popen("dir e", "r");

Will fork a dir e command, connect its output via pipe for your program to

Don't forget to use a pclose(woof) when you're done with it.

Pete

P.S. Conversely, you could write to it if properly setup:

  FILE *arf;
  ...
  arf = popen("qsort", "w")
  while(not(done))
        fprintf(woof,"%s", word[count++]);

I made up a new set of docs that I'll be uploading soon that includes popen()
and pclose() -- also fixes some errors I made in the last ones. Never ending

Thanks a lot for your reply, Pete.  That does clear things up immensely. I
believe your short description filled in the gaps in my understanding on how to
properly implement popen() and pclose().  I'm still going to bug Mark though
and see if he has a copy of the formal documentation.

The CM-8 is an analog monitor... the IBM normally puts out digital RGB info,
when used with a CGA adapter.

Thus, the answer is "no, not easily".  It might be possible to convert the RGB
Digital to RBG Analog, but it would require a hardware conversion.

I heard some time ago that Chris Babcock was working on one--I don't know how
far along he's gotten, and when I first heard of it, he said the DECB version
would be first.  (I hope he's changed his mind and gone for an OS-9 version
that would go on the MM/1 and the CoCo 3 with minimal bother.)

  Chris has abandonned the idea of an "auto" type program for the CoCo.
  I believe this has been mentioned several times, both here and in the CoCo

I am writing a Basic09 programme in which I want to turn off the echo in a
window opened with the "/w" descriptor. I cannot use SHELL "xmode /w4 -echo"
for instance because I do not know the number of the window device. Selecting
it and then running xmode doesn't seem to work either. I have the feeling that
there must be a set of values which can be put along the path to the window in
question which will do the trick.... TYPE echoff=esc,value:BYTE DIM
putval:echoff putval.esc=??? putval.value=??? OPEN #path,"/w" PUT #path,putval
Can anyone fill in the blanks? Thanks.... Rog.

There's a syscall that will return the name of a device.  I have used that
before to get the name of a window just opened.  The syscall is SS.DevNm. It's
on page 8-115.

Roger,

    The easiest way I can think of is to use SysCall. Consider this example:

  ....
  TYPE registers=cc,a,b,dp:BYTE;x,y,u:INTEGER
  DIM reg:registers
  DIM opt(32):byte
  ....
  ....
  OPEN #wpath, "/w":UPDATE
  reg.x=addr(opt)
  reg.b=$00
  reg.a=wpath
  RUN SYSCALL($8D,reg)
  opt(5)=0
  reg.a=wpath
  reg.b=$00
  reg.x=addr(opt)
  RUN SYSCALL($8E,reg)
  ....
  ....

    What this does is use the OS9 Getstat and Setstat calls to get, modify, and
store the options for the unknown window.

 References:
   Basic09 manual:
      Syscall    11-166
   Tech manual:
      SCF path options   6-4 6-5
      GetStat            8-54
      Setstat            8-63
      SS.opt             8-112  8-131

Ask on anything unclear (the way I write, probably all of it)

Roger -

Xmode only works BEFORE a device is opened.  Once you have a path, tmode is
what you would use... except that tmode only works for the first 3 paths
(standard in/out/err).

So you have to use syscall to do an SS.Opt set-status call, which is what tmode
does.

Whoever gave the example Syscall code is doing what you need to do. Try his
code and ask him Q's until you get going okay. Keep at it! best - kev

 Yup. But, nope, I do not hook up to 5ESS (I should say *yet*). I hook up to
DACS I, DACS II, and all DS1 (ie. T1) digital facility terminating and
monitoring equipment. None of my equipment (*yet*) directly terminates
traditional "phone lines". Our Beta (White Plains) is presently hooked up to 20
DACS frames and numerous other boxes.

If memory serves, one needs the second board for the MM/1 to hook up a hard
disk, and it wants a SCSI hard disk.  (Price?  From looking at the ad in the
current *RAINBOW*, it looks like that would be the "MM/1 Extended," $1125, but
IMS folk may wish to comment further (is there a kit equivalent? I dunno).)

I think you're right.  Hopefully Paul will see this msg and answer.

As JJ said, the second board has the DMA SCSI (WD33C93) interface... so any of
the SCSI hard disks, or a regular disk with an Adaptec 4000A/4070 SCSI
controller board, should work fine.

They're supposed to have a deal worked out for hard disk sales. Still, Computer
Shopper continues to have some great ads!
