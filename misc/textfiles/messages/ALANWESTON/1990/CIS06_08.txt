~ Al,
  I asked a local fidonet sysop (John Musselwhite of Keyboard BBS: 403-246-6943
300/1200/2400 8N1) for some fidonet BBS numbers in your area, and he came up
with the following 3 in Conway:

        Thunder BBS     1-501-329-9419
        Quantum Leap    1-501-329-6240
        0007 Bird       1-501-329-0007

  He says there are more in Conway, but none in Little Rock.  If you contact
one or more of these BBSes you should be able to find the rest.  Oh, in case
none of them carries the COCO and OS9 echoes at present, ask the sysop for
"COCO" or "OS9" on the "backbone".  At least I think thats right... if not
exactly right it should be close enough to get what you're after, if you're
interested in those echoes at all.  There are plenty more echoes to choose from
as well, far more than I would even attempt to list.
  Bruce

Floyd, your mistake is KILLing the modules. For some reason, KILLing causes B09
to lose the module. The best way is to use SYSCALL to do a Non Mapped Load/ &
Unload. The non-mapped load will load a module in memory but outside your map.
Then, when you RUN it, it gets mapped in (as long as there is room). In Wiz
Pro, I keep 16k free, and map in and out many modules this way. BTW, be careful
merging modules. Merged modules tend to load as one module, and you can't call
one without getting the other. Hope this is clear. Let me know if you need
more.

Thanks for the info!  I knew the problem had to be because I was KILLihe
modules, but, if I didn't, then I would get the dreaded Module Not Found error.
One questions: do I do a non mapped load before I RUN the module or will RUN do
it for me?

To: All

I found a slight problem with my latest version of The Dungeon Depths. An out
of memory error occurs on level 7.  To remedy this, you must do the following:
If booting from Multi-Vue, change line 4 in the AIF from 0 to 128. If not
booting from MV you will not be able to use the Depths routine. Instead, type:
  LOAD DEPTHSMOD

Sorry about any inconvience.

      I just got back from the Charlotte Color Computer Users Group meeting
where I saw a demonstration of the MM1.

      The machine looks great and the graphics are AWESOME! It's hard to
believe those GIF pictures were on Kevin's CM8 monitor. They rivaled or
surpassed VGA. Kev's graphics demo just has to be seen to be believed. He's got
some really sharp pictures.

      I can't wait to get my hands on one of these machines.

Kev. I know others have modifies d your play utility since you originally wrote
it, but I have come across a problem after I use play5 (the latest version).
Wwhen I fire up Dynacalc after I use the play program,  there is a weird
buzzing in my monitor's speaker. I remember hearing about this problem before,
but I don't know if there is a patch for it, or if it is really a problem ?
What do you think. TC

To: Mike Guzzi

Mike I have been using the rsdos utility that came with my Disto SCII to import
sound files from Studio Works to os9. Now I can share them with you and others.
I can't wait to get the new 8 bit A/D cartridge that Oblique Triad is coming
out with. We should be able to get CLEANER samples with it at a lower sample
rate, which means more sound in less time. I had one or 2 samples that were
bigger than a standard rs floppy, so I couldn't bring it home to os9. Bummer !
I asked them if they could support os9 in the future, or at least 40 track or
DS drives. Their reply was no, but they might port Studio Works Pro to MSDOS of
all OS'S. Oh well, I guess I can live with sound files 156k or less long. TC

Ok, ok. DAKS catalogs are 2 much some times. But they do have some good deals,
some junk. I know, I live less than a mile from them. I bought 2 microphones
with stands from them a few months ago. They seem to work very well, (for what
I use them for, they are fine. I have primarily been using them to sample
sounds for Studio Works. The cocos A/D circuitry is somewhat noisy, so any
small noise induced from the mikes would not be very noticable). I have also
bought a lot of the X10 home controllers/modules from them. Unfortunately the
coco / or the switching power supply I use makes so much interefence, sometimes
I can't controll some of my modules. I have to turn off the coco, before I can
turn off the modules. Talk about remote control ! TC

Kevin,

I knew it would happen. As soon as I wrote to you, the disk and documentation
arrived. So, in the words of .... ah .... what's-her-name .... (Gilda), 
``...Never mind.''

Unfortunately, no matter how I torture my d1 descriptor, I can't read the
Virtual Terminal disk. I can read the root directory. But, trying to access
anything deeper results in a 247 error (using a standard OS9 level two system).
In fact, I can dump the first 9 sectors from the disk, but no further. Does
that sound like a blown disk to you or just a reading problem - perhaps the
wrong number of sectors per track?

Wendell -

<grin> I figured that you'd get it right after leaving me a message!

Hmmm. Well it must not be a single density track 0, if you can dump it that
far. Perhaps the sector offset is wrong? If you dump it, does the first sector
you see look like LSN 0 at all? (if you're not sure what one looks like, dump a
good disk).

If it doesn't, and you have the SC-II cc3disk or bob santy's cc3disk... try
doing a "dmode /d0 typ=22" and see what you get. On my driver at least, there's
no need to change tos/sct except when formatting oddball disks.

it smears their action games...
