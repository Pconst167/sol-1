Steve,

Not to mention what it would have done to Al's message! Look at all those
"#:"s! There are just some basic assumptions that have to be made in order for
offline message processing to work. The possible combinations of scrambled data
boggle the mind, and the actual messages themselves can contain confusing
information, even TAPCIS will barf on a message within a message.

It does help to be a little flexible, though, maybe the scan routine in view
can be modified to ignore leading blanks when searching for "#:".

~ Al;

  Try this :

comment out the line just AFTER "READ #inpath, i$"  and just before or after it
add this line :

 "IF SUBS R(prompt1,i$) > 0 OR LEFT$(i$,L2)=prompt2 THEN"

and see if this works for you.

  It would seem that you're getting line noise or other stray chars. in your
data stream. Although this MIGHT cause you to miss a  occasional message, the
program should re-synch after reading the next message header.  Yours is the
first report that I've had on this problem, so I'm at a bit of a loss right
now.
  The problem with this fixtis that the program will probably not be able to
pick up the message number which sets the reply flag, and it won't allow you to
reply to the message.

  I'm working on the program right now, and will keep your problem in mind and
try to incorporate a more positive method of ID'ing the message start.

4.6.1 isn't that much an improvment over 4.6.0. It does fix bugs in Part Copy

Why, exactly, does os9 use the stepper motor in the drives much more than the
familar Disk Basic Dos system. I am getting familar with os9 and am finally
understanding it a little better. It seems to take a lot longer to load
programs in because of the searching of the step motor. Would a hard drive step
just as much? thanks, Denise

If information one needs isn't on the disk track the head currently is on, then
one has to move the head (i.e. seek, which on floppies uses the stepper motor).
Not much that an operating system can do to get around that, save for keeping
information in memory in one of several ways:

1. have it in ROM (e.g. DECB, all of whose commands are in ROM) 2. cache it (a
la Sardis Tech and at least some other "no-halt" controllers) 3. explicitly
load it (using the OS-9 load command to snarf stuff you use a lot into RAM so
that it doesn't have to get it from the disk every time)

In my startup file, I have a line that reads "load /dd/cmds/misc.utils", and I
have in that file the various commands that I have found that I use a lot. 
That can speed things up quite a bit.  Give it a try.

Denise,

Os9 is very disk intensive ... that's why folks insist on a two drive system as
a mere minimum, then a hard drive as soon as possible. If money's too tight for
one of those ... make good use of a ramdisk.

Without anything being loaded into memory, a simple set of commands to do
nothing but call up a directory, find a file then load it will hit the disk
many times.

Lessee ... first it gotta find DIR ..then it's gotta  find LOAD then it can go
after the file you need. You can cut down a lot of this by merging a lot of
your more frequently used commands/utilitys and loading them into memory.
Working from the ramdisk also helps in this way.

It's a trade off, tho .. less memory for instant access.

One other item as well.... Coco Disk Basic allocated the disk into fewer,
larger chunks (68 all total, each being 9 sectors long). While it was much less
prone to having file parts scattered all over the disk, you could only have a
maximum of 68 files on the disk (frequently less). Also, even the smallest
Basic program used 9 sectors.

It depends on what you're doing. Programs seem to take a little longer to load,
often because of the CRC checking being done to make sure it's a good program
load.

If you don't have some commands in memory (like list or load or dir), then
using those ("list /d1/file") would seem to move the disk around more because
first List must be loaded and then the target file accessed.

Otherwise, no, you really shouldn't see much diff. A hard disk is so much
faster that you won't notice stepping around that much, btw.

Hmmm. Got an example or two of something which seems to step the motor more?

Hi Kev!

I don't really know what happened [grin] except that I was adding and/or

Thirty seven directories and 18 files are in my root directory. All seems to
behave normally save that 60,000 sector reduction in diskspace. Bob Santy could
probably fix this mess in 2 minutes, but I'vee simply got to learn how to
extricate myself solo from these problems.

The dir e when performed on the root directory, gives no evidence of an
inflated file...Must I follow each trail to its end to find the problem file
with 'dir' or is there a shortcut????

Art - maybe not (following trails). Usually a dcheck can point out all the
"sectors allocated but not in file structure" sectors, which can then be given
back to the disk.

But that assumes that dcheck will work, and with 55 file/dirs in your root, it
may not. Depends. Hmmm.

Dumping the disk raw and checking the allocation bitmap is the thing I'd do
first... see if the end of the bitmap has been used for some reason. Or check
LSN 0 and see if the bitmap size info has become corrupted for some reason. You
haven't changed the descriptor lately, have you?

Fm: Mark Griffith 76070,41
To: All

Call for UUCP beta testers:

The OS9 UUCP port is nearing completion.  To test the package as much as
possible, additional testers are needed.  Anyone wishing to become a beta
tester please read the following requirements:

    1.  You must have access to a UUCP site to test file transfers.
        You also must be able to establish a UUCP login account on this
        system, Either setting it up yourself or getting the system
        administrator to do it for you.

    2.  You must have dial-in access to your OS9 system and you must
        have a modem setup for auto-answer available at least during
        the night to receive UUCP calls.

    3.  You must be able to make some long distance phone calls, at least
        during the night, to call other UUCP testers.  The number of calls
        you are willing to make depends on how much money you can afford.
        You WILL NOT be required to make lots of calls (perhaps one or two
        a week).

    4.  You must have Pete Lyall's CRON utility, or be able to download it
        from here and implement it on your OS9 system.

    5.  You must be willing and able to replace any existing login system
        with one of two new systems to have UUCP work correctly.

    6.  You must have a mail utility, or be willing to install one of
        several available on your system.

    8.  You SHOULD have a hard disk drive, but this is not required.  A
        floppy disk system must be able to hold all the UUCP files.  A
        system using 720K disks should be fine, but a 360K system with
        only one drive will not.  In any case, a floppy based system may
        not be fast enough.

    9.  You SHOULD have the OS9 C compiler and know enough about C programming
        to be able to make minor changes if needed.  However, those without
        the compiler can still be a tester, but you'll have to settle for
        the defaults built into the UUCP package.

   10.  You must be able to work with myself and the other testers.  Anyone
        just looking for an advance copy of the port need not reply.  Source
        code will only be given out to those showing an express need.

If you need more information, post a message here, in E-Mail, or call me

Scott,

I'm not sure you would want to test the uucp port since it will require one of
two different login packages which are probably much different then yours, as
well as a different mailer.  In any case, I'll put you on the list.

Am I getting across what I want?

example:

I used to have wcreat /w2 -s=2 etc.. Then went to the manual and modpatched the
bytes so /w2 is a -s=2 ect. So now it just gets iniz, shell ia. Necessary?
Maybe not, but I knew it could be done.

Lute -

I think I see what you mean. First, I might mention that WMODE.AR here in Lib
10 lets you "xmode" your window descriptors to be of any type, size and default
palette numbers... and I recommend that everyone wmode's all the descriptors to
80x24 type 2 windows so that "program <>>>/w&" works okay. You've done that by
hand, but wmode is easier (and then people can just save those out to disk and
make a new os9boot of course).

Anyway.. ok, you want to change the default palette values, I think. SS.DfPal
can be used for that, or you can actually modify Grfint/Windint's default
internal tables. Look around offset $2F2 or $2F3 in whichever of those you use
for this sequence of values:

 $3F,$09,$00,$12,$24,$36,$2D,$1B  (pals 0-7)
 $3F,$09,$00,$12,$24,$36,$2D,$1B  (pals 8-15)

Those are the default 16 palette values for pals 0-15 (they repeat as you can
see for 0-7 and 8-15). The colors are White, Blue, Black, Green, Red, Yellow,
Magenta, and Cyan. You can change them to whatever you wish, altho some
programs may assume the original default colors. - kev

still under test and development. I did upload it because a few users were
complaining about the lack of comm programs under OSK. Due to a lack of time, I
didn't at the time had enough free hours to continue, so I passed a copy of the
assembly source to one of my friend who was able to correct a few bugs left in
it (especially the xmodem lock-up) and he add a few others features, like
YModem, extended dialer, parity control, screen and shell enhancements, etc.
I've just upload it in Lib 12 under the name AtermV2_6.ar, so use it and let's
hope your xmodem problem is resolved.

    It's hard to spot the exact cause of the xmodem lock-up. While on my
machine with the original aterm program this problem never appears, my friend
had the same problem than yours on his Mega ST2 computer. When I used his new
aterm version 2.6 on my 1040ST, I have problem with parity settings, while on
his side everythings OK.

   It seems that there too many versions of ST computers on the market; if you
have followed the PC-DITTO II saga in the ATARIVEN conference, you have surely
noticed incompatibility between ST's. While some machines have CPU under the
keyboards, others have the same chip near the floppy drive. Bad lots of MMU and
GLUE chips also give problems.

   Here in Montreal ST machines have mostly disappear from stores; they are
replaced by STE machines, with 4096 colors, stereo outputs, SIMMS RAM. The 64
pins 68000 CPU is replaced by a square grid array package. That means that
PC-DITTO II will not work on those machines.

   Atari TT 68030 machines were introduced here in Montreal two weeks ago, I
don't know if it's still using a 68901, or even if OS9/ST will boot on it. As
soon as I have time I'll go in a Atari store, bring a copy of OSK with me and
try to boot it. Price is around $3200 US for a basic machine with 2 MBytes of
RAM and 40 MBytes hard disk. There is a Motorola VME bus on that machine, so
maybe we can add a few boards.

Thanks for the info.  I also use the Mega ST 2.  I haven't been in the
ATARIVEN section yet, but I had heard about the compatibility problems
with PC-DITTO II.  Just to add a little to your statement about compatibility
between ST's:  My Mega 2 came with a little circuit board with a 74LS74 on
it going to pins 12 through 18.  In the process of messing around with the
hardware I blew up my CPU and had to desolder it (I put a socket in after I
removed the old CPU) and replaced it with a 68000P10 (that at the time I
bought it was 4 weeks old by the date code).  With the new CPU I didn't need
the satelite board anymore so I removed it.
Another thing I noticed is that most Mega 2's come with a composite sync
signal on the monitor connector, NOT MINE !?
Iwill download the new version and try it out.
Thanks again.

of questions. First, what does that UG in your title stand for? Second,I tried
a small prog. from the manual(OS9) in the Basic09 section. No can do chief.
I've been programming Basic for about 3 years now and I can't figure this stuff
out. Look at pg.9-37 in the Basic09 sec. When I create then change to the
window,all I get are a bunch of dots, no letters. I know it has to be the merge
command, I'm not getting the fonts into /w1 or something. Big problem is that
once I ex the terminal screen,I have to BOOT-UP again because the window
doesn't work!(or rather I can't
 tell if it's working 'cause I don't read morse code. Run it and you'll know
what I mean) I'm asuming you have the manual,though it might have a little dust
on it(it sounds like youu don't need it much any more.), if
 you don't, I'll give you the   command sequense next message. Thanks for all
your help. -->GG

UG stands for "user group".  Shouldn't matter what window you merge fonts into;
SCF snarfs the escape codes on the way out and stores the font data away.  You
should be very sure that the font group and number your program asks for
matches that of one of the fonts you merged, or you'll get the Morse code
consistently! <grin>

George - ah, I caught your message to James. "Pack" is built into basic09. (Be
sure to save your program source to disk first!)

If you just type "pack" it'll try to convert/save the program to your commands
directory. If you'd swapped disks on OS9, then it could get confused and try to
open a new file in a wrong place on disk... thus a common 214 "no permission"
error causer.

Be sure writeprotect is off the disk, that there's enough room on disk, and
that you've done a "chx /d0/cmds" for example, first. If there's not enuf room,
pack to somewhere else: stick in a fresh disk, "pack >/d0/filename". Back
later.

When you pack a procedure, BASIC09 creates a file by the name of the (first, if
you do a pack*) procedure named in the current execution directory.  Perhaps it
is permission on an already-existing file there by that name that is being
referred to.

Geo - Ah. What happened was that wcreate'ing the window automatically defaults
the font to stdfonts... unfortunately they don't exist yet <grin>.

So do the same lines, EXCEPT do the stdfonts merge BEFORE wcreating the window.
Now when the window is made, os9 finds the font in memory and can use it right
away.

Also, you might want to say "merge /d0/sys/stdfonts" instead of the way they
did it, as you might not be sitting on the root dir of the disk with the SYS
subdirectory like they assume. You can tell they assumed this because they used
a relative pathlist "sys/stdfonts" instead of an absolute pathlist like
"/d0/sys/stdfonts".

Which reminds me of a side tip which always helps new OS-9 users: when you CHD
or CHX to a new disk/dir, OS9 remembers that spot on that *one* particular disk
(not the pathnames themselves)... so switching disks and not using chd/chx
again (or not using full pathnames with the drive name in front) will often
cause confusion on the part of os9 and yourself <grin>.

Hope you can get 512K soon... the machine really opens up enormously when you
do... almost no limit, practically speaking. Keep at it! best -kev

PS: you could also have blindly typed "display 1b3a c801" while in the dots,
which means "use font c8 01", which are the stdfonts group/buffer numbers.
Bing. It'd have come up. Try "display 1b3a c802" just for fun, also. That's the
stdfonts 6x8 version.

Perhaps the thing to do is to describe for us the sequence of events leading up
to the 214.  Be sure to mention any and all swapping of disks, chd and chx

Mark,

I am now running one of my systems at my law office. Most of the files have the
attributes set for both the owner and public read and write. On some of the
files the modification date is important for backup purposes. I began to notice
that the modification dates got out of sync and eventually figured out it was
when the user who did not own the file updated it. (At the office, neither my
secretary or I run as super user.)

I checked this out on my system here and confirmed that an update by a person
with write permission only updates the file date if the person is also the
owner.

The version of RBF I run is $10 with a CRC of $C199E8. It is circa 1983 and
purchased from Smoke Signal Broadcasting.

For further information you might ask Carl Kreider. He has a revised version of
RBF which he did and gave me a copy of years ago.  It does not reflect the bug
described above.

Hope this helps.

David,
 I have set environment variables in C, and can give a pointer to avoid the
pits *I* fell into.
 Make sure that you have storage in the program that sets or changes
environment variables for the entire array of pointers *and* the strings to
which they point. Do *NOT* just change the values you are passed, as there is
no C data structure implicitly declaring storage for them and the code that
would "find out" how much storage was there will make the program hard to read
later. Here's what I do:
 char *env[20];    /* storage for 19 envir pointers and NULL */

 .....

 env[0] = "TERM=vt100";
 evn[1] = "PORT=/term";
 env[2] = "SHELL=ksh";
 env[3] = 0;



 Of course you can use getenv() to pass on variables you were passed. Note that
getenv() returns an int, not a char * as the manual says (I know, in OSK they
are the same - this will save you a warning by doing the cast).


 Good luck!

I played with your older version of LOGIN for quite some time before I started

in newer releases?

The format of the password file was actually derived from the "standard"
onei.e. what the original login module used.  However, I added several fields
at the end, which the original one barfs on, and I accidently got the user and
exec dirs backwards.  I also change the "defaulting" of several of the fields,
i.e. a blank user directory is not illegal but will default to /dd/user/(name).

The V3 package still uses this format - but in the V4 release (soon to be out)
I have corrected the user/exec dir being exchanged.  Also being added to the V4
release is a password.dat format (with fast username/name/number index files)
as an option - which is necessary to use several additional features.

Anything before V3 is considered garbage - especially the 0.9 that I had a long
time ago (3 years?) uploaded here.  The V3 itself works quite well, and since
all the C libraries and some source have been released on the net, writing
routines to interact with it is quite easy.  But yes, what some people would
call stanard routines will not work with the older formats.  This is being
completely fixed in the new V4.

I might be interested in your login package, but only if the password
file routines are available (even if it costs extra).  I would only
expect .r files, so that I can link them into some of my programs
that require access to the password file.  (like SU, CH
(like SU, and CHOWN).  My SU asks for a password to change user unless
you are root (just like the UNIX version).  And CHOWN will take a

Fm: Eric A. Cottrell  [WIT] 76327,515
To: ALL

Hi All,
I recently received a premier issue of a magazine dealing with the OS/2
operating system. I program with MSDOS at work and have no desire to lower
myself even further. But anyway...
One of the interesting things in the magazine is a cartoon captioned "OS/2 Cat
ponders future lives." It shows a cat looking at a gravestone that has "DOS CAT
R.I.P." on it. The bubble says "Goodbye old friend! Heck, I wonder what OS/9
will be like?"
Now I planning to write a letter to the editors and tell them what OS9 IS like!
The Cartoon is on Page 116 of the Premier 1990 Issue. David Nelson is the
Editor-in-chief, Linda Stephenson is the Managing Editor, and Leonora Wimmer is
the Publisher. The Address is The Silicon Beach Operation Inc., 1101B Eugenia
Place, Carpinteria, Ca 93013. In fact they mention they have a BBS at 1 (805)
684-0589. It mentions you can send letters to the editor. Maybe I can get some
experts (esp. ones that like cats hint.. hint...) to help me tell the story of
OS9. A mention of OS9000 is also in order.
One suggestion is to mention about the great record locking capability of OS9
Level 2. OS/2 assumes the application will do the record locking (Just what
does OS/2 do to take 2 megabytes????).
Of course I got a chuckle out of the cartoon on another level since DOS is not
dead and it may be several years before OS/2 is an OK operating system. This
very well could be when 80686 chips are out and once again an operating system
is behind the level of the hardware. The same as DOS is with 80286 and 80386
systems.

Hi James,
Why it is "OS/2 Magazine"! I managed to read some stuff and it seems to have a
very strong "DOS" bashing stanch. Pro-OS/2 at all cost!
I read some article on why "DOS is dead or should be" that was confusing. I
think it is because the person did not know the subject. Limitations of current
applications were taken as OS limitations. That DOS could not handle multiple
protocols.  I take protocols to mean communications protocols, but even if it
was data protocols I feel it is a applications issue instead of an OS issue.
DOS has capability for Device Drivers, make one! You also got the impression
that DOS programs have to be rewritten when new versions of DOS are released
and that interrupts and data structures of DOS change often. OS/2 was presented
as a OS that will not chamge. There are shortcomings with DOS, but this
magazine did not mention them. Could it be that OS/2 also has the same
shortcomings? I think in my letter I will mention, "Well if OS/2 will not
change, then I will not use it because it's shortcomings will never go away and
it will not take advantage of new stuff". DOS changed as new hardware and needs
became available. I can still use wordstar written for DOS 1.0 under DOS 3.3 so
what's the problem?
It says on the cover that it is an independent magazine, but IMHO, it looks
like something out of a PR department of Microsoft. It is also strange that
there is no date on the magazine other than the "1990 Premier Issue" on the
bottom of the page.
I sorry to get on my soapbox, but I've programmed in enough OSs to know that no
OS is perfect (not even OS9). People on this forum are Pro-OS9, but readily
admit to the problems and help you get around them or fix the problem in OS9!
Look at all the work that was done to remove dead code in GSHELL! Could one
problem with OS/2 be that it has 1 meg of dead code???

Well...OS/2 sounds like it suffers from "second-system syndrome" (the desire,
once one has done one system, to throw in every possible feature, egged on by
hubris at having done the first system--Fred Brooks, in *The Mythical
Man-Month*, may be the originator of this phrase).  At least the reference to
OS/2 in the new "jargon file" seems to think so (they mention OS/2 because,
they say, it's always good for a cheap laugh among programmers).  This would be
highly ironic, because technically, OS/2 is Microsoft's first operating system,
since they bought the first version of MS-DOS from elsewhere!

(edited) LONDON - Motorola Semiconductor Products Monday announced their intent
to provide CD-I silicon chip sets to hardware manufacturers worldwide. This
latest development coincides with the Multimedia Conference on Interactive CD
hosted by  Philips, Sony, Matsushita and Polygram.
   The chip set includes the MC68340 32-bit microprocessor, a highly integrated
solution for graphics applications, plus dedicated still video and video
processing devices.  A part of this set is a full screen, full motion
decompression processor for the CD-I standard.
   By providing a global source of high quality silicon, Motorola aims to ease
the development of hardware products conforming to the CD-I standard. This will
accelerate the acceptance of CD-I as a Multimedia standard and add momentum to
its rate of growth as the next major consumer product innovation.
   Availability of this revolutionary video processing device is timed to
coincide with major CD-I equipment launches in 1991. More details will be made
available following the meeting of the MPEG committee in September 1990. (MPEG
- The Motion Picture Experts Group is a joint ISO/CCITT standard committee,
tasked with defining a global standard for video compression.)
   Over 100 companies have signed up to support CD-I, the majority of them
developing the innovative software titles which will drive consumer and pro
usage. Motorola will be assisting Philips IMS and their partners to realize
CD-I as a global success in consumer electronics and Multimedia computing.
   Based on this latest announcement, the hardware companies will be able to
accelerate their product developments, while guaranteeing conformance to the
standard.  This standardization is critical for such a global consumer product,
guaranteeing that any disk bought anywhere in the world will play on any
manufacturer's hardware.

Hi Steve,
Well I can guess that you picked up another power supply!
You can usually assume that +5 volts is used if it is TTL (+12 volts on CMOS)
amd +12 and -12 for the RS232. The negative supplies are the lightest amperage
while the +5 is the heaviest. If it is an eariler microprocessor then -5 could
also be used.
You can get into some weird stuff. One terminal I remember used +70 volts for
the monitor. It sounds like ratings were stamped on the PS.
I will still look up the area's hamfest and post them tomorrow.

The ratings were stampped on the new power supply ... I made sure of that! :-)
There were severall flavors of this type of ps ... some had ratings on the
board some did not ... I chose the former. I didn't want to be guessing any
further than I already was.

Yes ... in hindsight, +5 and +/- 12 make sense. But this tube is weird ... and
they have a nasty habit of devouring power supplis. Bill and Mark both had a
couple I sent them and both got tied of feeding 'em! ;-)

Do appreciate the effort on the ham fests. Just lemme know.

~ Jim;

  The Amiga designers did a good job on the hardware, I'll agree!  There's lots
of things about it that I really like - just hope the MM/1 equals or exceeds
it.

  The PS/2 keyboard (AT 101 style) does NOT have a HELP key.  I've been using
one for about 18 months now, and it's really well thought out and easy to
learn.  The one that I got (don't remember the mfg.) has the large ENTER key,
left/right CTRL and ALT keys, ESC in the upper left, 12 PF keys in groups of 4
across the top, a keypad off to the right, etc.

  The I*M world has adopted the F1 key as the standard for HELP in the past few
years... all the systems that I use at work, with the exception of areas of
PROFS use F1, as do almost all the DOS based programs that I've come in contact
with.

  I'm not saying that we need to stick to this standard, only that we should
adopt SOME standards for all the MM/1 software that is bound to appear.  If, at
the same time, we could remain compatible with the user interface, it would
probably make the computer easier to learn for DOS types.

Hi Wayne!

The TOP discs are over 11 Megabytes long - Most of the data is already
compressed.  I don't think its practical.  (TOP has placed *NO* restrictions
against doing this.)  At an average transfer rate of around 1200 - 1500 bytes
per second, this would take around 2 1/2 hours (no errors).  Do you have enough
disk space available in the OS9 forumn?

Hi Ed!

Wayne, I'm sure, will have a reply as well but let me drop a few pennies in the
hat.

While space is a precious commodity on any system, if the files that are taking
up such space are usefull and getting a lot of action, then the space is
certainly justified.

With the added interest in OSK system comming about recently, anything to shore
up our OSK library is gonna see a lot of action.

Upload time is free ... and the advanced warning about disk space is good to
know as we can pre shuffle some block aound so you're not inconvenienced by a
'lack of space' error.


Many folks will still want to send off for the diskettes as they weight their
time against the total download time. But many will opt to roll their own,
piece by piece.

The forum would seem to be a great way to 'help get the word out'!

If we don't have enough available, we can certainly acquire enough, Ed. That's
not really a problem, like Steve mentioned.

What I'm thinking of is the fact that the Mizar format is not universal, and
some folks may be left out because of that.. plus.. others may not want the
whole thing.

Is the library broken down into logical sections, or is it just a mixmash of
files?

Could there be some way you might choose a bit of "The Best Of.." and see if
there's enough interest to justify uploading the rest of the material? That
might help us gauge the interest in OSK here, as well.

As I said... we're interested in helping out the average user, but don't wanna

OK - I'll try to upload.  Give me a couple of days to set-up for it.  Do you
plan a special directory or should I just transfer to dl12?

The reason for the 'MIZAR' format is that some of discs are full - 0 bytes left
- and this after setting SAS to 1!

BTW, I made a *small* error in my arithmetic - it should have read 1200 - 1500
*bits* - 120 - 150 bytes.  Transfer time will be about 25 hours - WOW!  (If my
wife balks at the phone bill, you'll have to defend me!)

I think the OSK library would probably be fine for the initial uploads, Ed. If,
at some time in the future, you (or someone else) decides to upload the whole
library, we can make some changes in that decision.

No problem on the Mizar format.. I can read and write it with no problem, but
only 40 tracks... it's not that common, methinks.

Anyway.. like I said.. don't feel you have to upload the whole thing.. a sample
of what you feel folks would like would be fine with us.

Hi Wayne!

I'll upload the docs, etc. tomorrow morning and sometime next week, the
contents of 'disc 1'.  AR'd, the docs *only* take 113,000 bytes but 'disk 1'
looks like about 650,000 bytes.  (Can I send the phone bill to Steve ,grin.?)

Question  -  Each disc contains sub-directories.  Is there a way to do the AR
and preserve the directory structure?.  I tried "ar -u <filename> ./*" and "ar
-u <filename> top_1/*".  Neither worked and my docs don't cover the subject. 
(BTW, this is for a 68000 machine.)

etc.  This will archive _all_ files in directory NAME and its sub_directory

The Dungeon Depths is a game I wrote in BASIC09.  Basically, you maneuver a man
around each level trying to kill (or avoid) monsters and attempting to find
your way to the next level.  The object of the game is to get to the final
level and get the Power Gem.  How many levels are there?  Only the author
knows!  Anyway, I've receive a lot of compliments on it and I still enjoy
playing it.  I've only solved it once if that gives you any indication on how
challenging it is. If you download it, be sure to get DUNGN1.AR.  I believe
that's what I called it.  It's in the Tandy CoCo library.

I have a couple of questions for you. I'm using Sterm 1.3 on CIS now, but with
a modified termcap. I have only the very basic commands in it. If I try to use
the one that comes with 1.3 I end up with a very interesting display, and a
locked up system.

So where can Isget this CC3io patch? Please don't tell me it was with the AR
file. When I downloaded Sterm, I was still using a CoCo 2, so much of the stuff
just got filed, and when I looked for the AR file I can't seem to fi d it. Must
have scratched it at some time.

Also what term set should I be using on CIS? At this time it's set to (other).
Is this what I want?

Lute,

The termcap entries that Sterm use only need to be simple.  Sterm uses the code
for erasing the screen, reverse video, and cursor movement only.  Any fancier
entry is just wasted with Sterm.

There have been problems with the termcap port on the 6809.  I don't know how
to correct it tho, and really haven't looked into it to much.  The main reason
I used termcap was to allow porting Sterm 1.3 to different OS9 systems
including Pete Lyalls GIMIX (now deceased), and OSK machines.  It's a shame the
6809/OS9 termcap port was not better since it does cause system lockups as you
have noticed, simply by changing one byte in an entry.

To correct your problem, I'd stay with the entry that works for you.

The patch for CC3IO is included in the archive for the latest Gshell patches.
Can't remember the name, but if you go to DL10 and look for the latest Gshell
patches, it should be in there.  You can also use the other patches in that
file.

As far as you terminal settings for CIS, I'd use a CRT and have it send
formfeeds.  This clears your screen between each menu and looks neat.

  I may have found an 'anomaly' in STERM.  I was downloading some files this
morning, and after the 2nd one, I checked the transfer rate (ctrl Z).  I don't
believe that it was only 34%, but that's what it told me.

  Anyway, on the third file, after entering the name of the file for my
computer, instead of creating the 'download box', I got a line at the bottom of
the screen in reverse video of "*--------------------*" and another line at the
top of the screen, also in reverse video, of garbage chars.  As the download
progressed, the byte counter incremented properly (and was readable), and after
completion (yes, it was successful), everything returned to normal. Upon
checking the xfer efficiency again, it was a phenomintl 327.6% !!!

Specifics: CoCo3, STERM v.1.3, invocation "sterm13", baud=2400, 38ms HD w/
           B&B interface.

  Next time I dl something, I'll see if I can duplicate the problem.

Jim,

Sterm Version 1.3 does have an elusive bug somewhere that causes that.  I'm not
sure if it is in the termcap code, or Sterm's logic.  I only noticed it a
couple times here, but I'm been running a slightly different version for the
past year or so.  I'll be uploading that version in the near future and I hope
it fixes that bug for you.

Also, I noticed that you arn't using the -f flag when you start Sterm.  If you
don't used this, Sterm assumes a "Classic" B transfer, which means no packet
send-ahead.  You'd very likely get a 34% efficiency rate then.  If you are
downloading to your hard drive, use the -f flag and you should get transfer
rates of around 72% - 78%.

Well it does in a way. It repeats but it never escapes the loop even when I

Turbo 'c' there is a function called 'getche()' which returns a character when
the key is pressed, NOT after a CR. Is there a function in microware 'c'.

Take a look at my program in the dl 10 area called EZDIR.AR .  Also if you need
it, I can upload some short C codes that I wrote to test single key entries. 
The program HDO.AR also in dl 10 use single key entry exclusively.

Buffered FILE I/O using the standard library functions is line oriented and not
well suited to reading single keypresses.  It's better to use the low level
system call functions for this purpose:

    read(fileno(stdin),&c,1);

This will stop and return the next keypress.  If you don't want the routine to
hang until a key is pressed use getstat() to check for data available:

    if(getstat(1,fileno(stdin))==0)
         read(fileno(stdin),&c,1);

I am interested in learning "C".  Could anyone possibly introduce me to some
reference material for this language.

Also, what is the "C" compiler that you recommend.



Thanks,

Rodney;

  C compiler depends on which machine you have.  For the CoCo, there's only the
Tandy C compiler for about $100.  There used to be others at a substantially
higher price, but I'm not sure if they're still available.

  For reference materials, there's a file in (I think) Lib 1 called CTUTOR.AR
which has many, many source code examples and some explanatory text. There's
also 'C Primer+' by the Waite Group (a SAMS book) which should be available at
any B. Dalton's or Waldenbooks.  Easy reading and very helpful, although a bit
shy on some examples. Another one that I've found helpful is 'ABC  A  Book on
C', but it's at work and I don't remember the author's name.

  For specific questions, be sure to ask here... there's a several hundred
years of experience available right here (I'm not one of them tho!  ;-) ).

    Kevin-
    How ya been?  I have not heard anything out of you for some time.  Frank
    came over tonite and he had gotten a lot of files thru his work which
    originated from ARCNET.  How do we get on this.  Seems to be a pretty
    interesting place.

    I've been using WizPro a lot and was wondering how much difference there
    was between CIS B+ and YModem.  They both seem to use packet sizes of one
    K.  Is YModem just as good as B+?

    Frank ordered his modem this week.  He should have it soon.  Would you
    like to trade modems with me?  I like this Supra Modem because of its
    front power switch.  Mine in newer and works just fine.  Its a Smart One
    2400 baud.  I have packaging and manual.

    I think that I can start to put together pieces for my hard drive  I'm
    looking at a 42 meg. and eventually replacing my drives with 3.5 80
    tracks.

    By the way-- Picked up something on one of the arcnet messages.  Is there
    much trouble with the Disto 1 meg board with the Tandy 512k upgrade or is
    this something that has already been fixed up?

    Hope to hear from you soon.
