Good information... at last! I'm only trying to reduce the amount of calls 'I'
get by responding to the question. The question related to the 16 bit K-Bus vs
the 32 bit MM1 bus and why. I know why the K-Bus is 16 bits and now I know why
the MM1 has a 16/32 bit bus. Thank you. PS I'm glad they liked the way the TC9
works. Imitation is the best flattery... Now don't start with the TC70 vs MM1.
(heh heh)

As to your questions. #1 re the TC70 upgrading to a 68030. Not possible, we did
not design it that way nor have we ever claimed that capability. The K-Bus is
expandable by replacing single function cards (CPU's etc) with better ones ie:
replace a 68000 CPU with a 68030 CPU. The other bus cards would still be used.
The TC70 is a multi-function card and only one can reside on the bus at a time.
It would have to be removed to upgrade the system to a 68030 for example. All
multi-function cards are less expensive to build because they do not have the
added cost of the bus for each function but they have the disadvantage of
inflexibility. That's why we offer both options. Spend more and have
flexibility, spend less and have less flexibility. In any case other K-Bus
cards added to a TC70 system would work with any CPU/multifunction card so not
all would be lost. BTW I have no intention of doing a 'shared-RAM adaptor' for
the TC70. The TC9 does that and that is enough for now. I may change my mind
later but not for now.

#2 The 5% loss was total system thru-put in a real life situation. I'll see if
I can get the specifics from Dave about exactly how he arrived at those
figures. This was done when the 68030 board for the K-Bus was being designed
(6-8 months ago) and I don't recall the details. In one case a 68030 K-system
replaced a 68020 20x system and the thru-put doubled, the K-system was twice as
fast as the 20x. (the 20x has a 32 bit data bus) However there is more to
performance than data bus size etc. The whole system and all its parts
contribute or detract from the overall performance.

The faster each area goes the faster it all goes. We, you and I etc tend to
dwell on minute details when it is really total system performance we should be
looking at.

I think it is a good idea to release you (I didn't know you weren't) to discuss
any and all plans that FHL has. I hope that doing this will encourage Paul to
do the same. His ads and promotional material leave much to guess about. I
think he may also be losing some sales due to this, at least in this group.
I've found that the CoCo OS9 users do not go for hype. As the old TV series
Dragnet used to say, "the facts mam, just the facts" You hereby have my
permission to discuss anything with anybody about what we are planning unless I
specifically ask you not to. Sometimes we talk about possibilities as opposed
to actual plans, no point in talking about anything that's just in the
'talking' stage anyway. You may also inform the asker if I have requested that
you not discuss a subject. Heck, I'm so open about what I'm doing that it puts
me at a competitive disadvantage anyway, why stop now.

Frank -- Aye, I agree on "just the facts, ma'am" from FHL and KLE. That's why I
chided you on the "sounds familiar" remark. Too close to a slam.

And I thought it was amusing that you'd tell Pease that it was  "Nice to hear
from you directly instead of thru others. You should call me if you have any
questions about what my plans are instead of using the round about way."  
That's funny, because I and others answer for both companies indirectly on many
BBSs; and because your second sentence applies to yourself answering Q's about
KLE's hardware <grin>. Deja vu.

Anyway, enuf chiding! It's to be assumed that each company will put its own
products in the best light; and usually vice versa. That's the biz. Perhaps the
debate in the forum will shed more light all around. Or perhaps add to the
confusion. Sounds like fun, anyhow... as long as it doesn't degenerate into the
infamous Owlware hard disk ads type of thing ;-).

BTW, your Q&A files have helped a lot of people, I'm sure. Interesting reading.

the 5% etc etc. I will have to wait for Dave to return from vacation for the

As far as competing with paul and selling the MM1 as you suggest. No thank yo.
If you remember I did not want to do your MM1 back in December and my reasons
havn't changed. I think the TOMCAT approach is the best way for me and CoCo
users. You and Paul think the MM1 is the way to go. GREAT! competing will only
inprove the market and the products both companies produce. If Paul were to
join forces with me as you suggest I think the product would cost more and not
have as many features.

Also Hazelwood has been doing OSK longer than anyone else and their port and
support software is without a doubt the BEST available. It will take years to
duplicate that by anyone else. I guess I'm just spoiled and don't want to move
backward.

 Frank Everyones OSK software is good since when you do a port most of the
software is from microware. The Idea behind OS9 is for microware to provide 99%
of the OS with the person doing the port suplying only 1%. it is misleading to
think that any ones OSK is beter than another persons. It only takes between 1
and 2 weeks to do an os9 port and that is only if you have unusual hardware.
Most of the osk problems start with microware and are shared equally with all
users. I speak from experience here. I have been using GIMIX hardware for about
4 years. We both know how long they have been at it. I have also done about 5
ports. There software suffers from the same problems as the software that I
have after doing the port. OSK 2.3 has manny problems which Hazlewood will
share with Paul and every one else who uses it. The computer that I am using
now is a 68030 which I ported OSk to about 1 year ago. Most of the problems
that I have had have been related to problems with OSK itself. That is why
there is a new version about once a year. Frank I wish you the best of luck

Weather Paul or you suceed will not affect my using of OSK or my designing of
new hardware.

George - yah, someone should do a tutorial on the dir layout. It's really quite
simple. The technical manual (RBF) section has the details, but it takes some
snooping around on a disk to put two and two together.

Do you have the dEd disk editor downloaded? That tool will be very helpful in
checking out the disk setup... a must-have program. Once familiar with it, a
tutorial will be easier to follow. It usually only takes about 20 minutes to
teach someone over the phone to fix and follow his os9 dir structure, in my
experience. I'll look into writing something up (if someone doesn't beat me to
it - please! grin).

Yeah, I have the dEd program. That can be very useful. What we need is tutorial
on reading directorys as opening a file, getting the information and converting
it into something readable like a 'dir e' would do in Basic09. That is the only
thing holding me back at this moment from writing a badly needed utility. I
work alot of hours so I don't get to devote the time that I would like to to
figure out how to get that information. The best I get to is to read the manual
while working. Now that's fun! If I could just get a little push in the right
direction, I could really get started on a few things. The manual tells what
certain things do by using syscall, but it doesn't tell you how to convert the
information into something readable. We need a book called "Inside Basic09"
real bad! <grin>...Anybody wanna write it?{ If I didn't have to work so

would a basic program which opened the current dir and printed a "dir e" style

George -

Piece'o'cake...

Just open the directory as you would any file, and instead of just READ, open
it for READ + DIR modes.

Then, read it in 32 byte chunks. The chunks are broken down:

filename[29] LSN_of_FD[3]

If the 1st byte of filename is 0, then the file has been deleted. Also,
filenames may be less than 29 characters. The last character always has the
high-bit (i.e. 'A' + $80 = $C1) set.

The LSN is the absolute sector number where that file's File Descriptor Sector
(FD) is stored. In the FD sector is all the information about file owner,
dates, attributes, size, and physical mapping on the disk. Best bet is to read
the technical manual on the RBF file manager to get detailed breakdown on this.

BTW - what's the utility? It's hard to imagine a flavor of directory based
utility that hasn't already been written for OS9.

   I'll have to do some more checking but from the ad's that I have found, the
UPS's that are available are not like the system you were talking about. They
appearently are the type that run the system on line power and switch to the
batteries on a low voltage or outage condition. I get this impression because
they all talk about 1 or 2 ms switching time.   I'm not sure yet about the
price range, I need to sit down and estimate the power requirements, from what
I see so far the cost could be anywhere $200 to $1500 depending on power
needed. If I can slide into the low end, the cost shouldn't be too bad.

Just thought I had to say something to somebody.  I actually connected my CoCo
to something via a serial port and it worked the first time (well, once I
corrected an address in a descriptor, but that's hardly anything compared to
puzzling out what wires to cross as yet another victim of the RS-232
"standard"--is that anything like jumbo shrimp, or military intelligence?).

JJ - whatcha need is one of those rs232 gizmos someone used to sell, which
automatically figured out the correct connections. Wonder what happened to
those? Maybe they didn't work so well <hehe>?

Congrats on getting it to work!

Mark,

Thanks for the message. I will look for the mroff documents in the library.
Could you upload the missing sleep.txt and system.txt files? Also they should
be added to the .ar file.

Mark,

A few more problems with the new clib docs.

1. I belive that the page for defdrive() is missing.

2. A couple of formatting problems (doesn't mroff do line wrap???). The pages
for _gs_rdy, password, and unixtime all contain lines which are too long for
the right margin. This causes an extra line feed(s) which mroff is not aware of
with the result that the page breaks are out of sync. I fixed it by inserted a
CR in the offending lines.

All we need now is an index (hint!).

This package of docs is a vast improvement over the previous situation--at
least now I only need about 4 manuals (instead of 5!) open on my desk. Thanks
again.

BTW, what do the numbers at the top of the pages mean: (3c) (3s), etc.

The numbers probably roughly correspond to those you'd find in Nuxi--er,
Unix--manual pages (1 for programs, 2 for system calls, 3 for standard I/O and
other library functions).

TOP15.TZ did not make it completely, and was not merged into the library.
TOP14.TZ DID make it, and is safely ensconded there.

I like the TEXT & Spell check, too, in fact, that's what is keeping me in
DeskMate.  The printer driver for the dot matrix printer is so limited that the
frustration level is off the scale.  I've used PC-Link to register a problem
(they said nobody else complained but they would forward the complaint) and
I've used the voice line to Ft. Worth.  The voice response was an offer to help
me set the printer with BASIC and use the (really dumb) ASCI printer driver!  I
agree on HST - Wonder how Fordyce feels?

Nothing for MOTD.  Sturdy old CoCo just keeps running.  I use it with UltiMusE,
WIZ and DynaStar for music, comm and wp.  I plan to go to Atlanta in October. 
See you there?

I've seen a copy of the August 1990 RAINBOW.  I intend to write Falsoft a
letter commending them for it.  If only they'd done this kind of thing a couple
of years earlier, the CoCo world would be far better off, in my personal
opinion.
