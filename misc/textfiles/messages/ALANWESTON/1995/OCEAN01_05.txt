  This is just a short note that I thought I should post. Since there
isn't any new uploads sections, I thought I would let anyone that
might be interested in a screen print program for the MM/1, know that
I have uploaded one(mm2hp30.lzh). This is a screen printer for the
HP laser & hp inkjet printers.

Warren,
      I missed this message due to my local BBS crashing a lot recently. 
Luckly the BBS that does my internet e-mail is a different one. Yes I
did recieve that message. Thanks
  
BTW; The BBS crashing is the reason I have been crossing the country to
read the message bases.

Paul - got the order out for your Monitor yesterday (some
holiday related delays on each end).  Your assumption on the cable is
correct, if you are looking at a 9-pin DB MALE connector on both ends.
Nice monitor, does have the strip based matrix Warren refers to elsewhere.

Hugo, you might want to consider the Sony CPD 1302 monitor I'm selling.
I'm told they are better than the NEC Multisync (.25 dot pitch)

(Never seen the NEC myself though.)

Yes, there are people listening.  (And I make a point of spending my $$$ 
on software for my MM/1.)

Hmmm...I am typing at this moment on an autosense keyboard (one of the
little bitty ones that Scott Griepentrog sold for a few years), so at
the very least there is at least one XT/AT autosensing keyboard that
will work on the MM/1.
