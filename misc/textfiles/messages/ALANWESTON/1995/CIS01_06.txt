After I boot up OS9, I have to set the CDEF environment variables to something
other than the default.  How can I change the default environment variables?

Can anyone tell me how to unarchive files with the arj extension. I am using
OS9 68000 and would like to try the OS9MAX utility.

Bill,

Do you know if there is a cross compiler of the compiler running on the Mac (a
port of the compiler?)
I am using the Microware compiler now (for CD-i development) but I heard the
GNU produces faster code, and of course is ANSI.

Bill,

I have the gnu sources, so theoretically I can do it myself.
The problem is that the GNU is very UNIX specific. It takes
a lot of porting effort to get it running on a Mac.
So I thought, maybe someone else did it already.

Steve,
 Some time ago, Tim Kientzle uploaded his latest port of TeX and LaTeX to that
other place where a lot of OS9 types hang out.  This is a pretty complete
typesetting system for OS9. It includes Metafont (font building program), and
`dvips', which converts the TeX `DVI' output files to PostScript and allows
other PostScript files to be included in the final document, which can then be
printed on a PostScript printer, or (via Ghostscript) previewed on the MM/1 and
printed on most any decent printer.

 Tim K. included three versions of the main executable files in the archive,
for small, medium, and large memory machines. His install script and
instructions make it easy to install and run - but reference books on TeX and
LaTeX are recommended.

 I can run things on my MM/1 and DeskJet and Epson that look like they came
from a print shop.

 The good news: I can upload it here.

 The bad news: Tarred and Zipped, its 2.27 MEGAbytes long.

 Can you find that much room in Lib 12?

 I still have Lout on the system, but I have to have TeX for the same reason
that I have a messydos computer --- the rest of the world is using it.  (OK
maybe not ALL of the rest of the world -- there are a few misguided souls using
WordPerfect and such). ;)

Lots of the GNU/UNIX stuff I have looked at has docs in TeX format. LaTeX makes
TeX ALMOST as easy as Lout, anyway.

Sb: PC <--> OS/9 via TCP/IP?
Fm: Ingo Pakleppa (ECS) 100041,102
To: all

Hello,

I'm developed a PC application that should talk to an OS/9 system (68k) via the
FTP protocol.

Most of the time, this works just fine - but sometimes, my TCP/IP package on
the PC end reports odd errors that I have not been able to track down.

I suspect some subtle incompatibility between the PC's flavor of FTP and the
OS/9 flavor. Distinct (the supplier of the PC TCP/IP software) was unable to
help me. Therefore, I now decided to bite the bullet and rewrite my software,
using a different package.

My questions are these:

- I am using Distinct TCP/IP 3.20. Does anybody possibly have experience with
the combination OS/9 - Distinct and know what might be the problem?

- has anybody successfully connected a PC with an OS/9 system? With which
TCP/IP software?


Some configuration information:

In the installation in question, two OS/9 systems are connected with a
(reliable) Ethernet connection. There are quite a few PCs connected to the same
Ethernet; they access a Novell server. One single PC actually talks to both the
Novell server and the OS/9 systems; both protocols are installed on top of the
same network adapter card.

I have also tried a connection between the two OS/9 systems and a PC only,
disconnected from the Novell network - same result. Therefore, I'm sure that
there is not just a conflict between the different network protocols.

The error I get apparently usually occurs during an ftp_get or ftp_put
function, and it returns error code 451 (which seems to indicate a local abort
- something I definitely did not trigger).

Thanks in advance for any hints, either regarding a different TCP/IP library or
finding the cause of the problem!

Ingo
