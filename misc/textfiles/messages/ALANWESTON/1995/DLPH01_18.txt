If I understand it right, the Ribbs_OSK is using more than screen
positioning codes like Vt100, it is also using the KWindow codes to make
windows, switch windows, etc.  It sound like the project should be
renamed from Ribbs_OSK to Ribbs_MM1 as it is rather specific to
one machine right now.  Not that I object, since I suspect the people
doing the work are running KWindows and that is easiest for them.

I haven't been following Fidonet much since I got into the Internet
on here.  I recall, though, that someone was working in getting
Binlkey ported to OSK.  Do you know anything about that project?

That's not quite the case. John is not "adding" K-win specific code. John is in
the process of converting code that is very much entrenched in the coco way to
OSK. There are four major areas that need attacked:

 o Asm subroutines need to be reprogrammed in 680x0 code
 o All code that assumes Basic09 data types, and there is a lot of it, needs to
be
   hacked to deal with OSK data types  (types mostly equals sizes here)
 o All coco specfic serial port stratigies need to be located and changed to
deal
   with the equally damaged, but very different, OSK serial enviroment.
 o All coco specific screen control needs to be made generic.

 This last one isn't really necessary for program development, as the MM/1
accepts coco screen codes. For this reason, it has been left for last... least
priority.

having some idea what John is going through (I looked at converting SuperComm to

OSK, and am helping John with the asm), hindsight tells me it would have been
better to use the RiBBs source disks for their BTU content and program from
scratch. John has put an enormous amount of work into this project.

  The main reason Ribbs_OSK is using KWindow calls, is that KWindows is
very very similiar tot he Window calls on the COCO OS9 LII. The OS9
Ribbs used many of the COCO Window calls, thus this port automaticly taylors
itself to the KWindow enviroment.
  As for Binkley, I was the one trying to port it to OSK. Ran into some
serious problems, having to do with the OSK CURSURS package and MODEM
access. I ran into the modem access problem with Ribbs_OSK but was able
to get around it for now. Bink uses many modem access parameters that are
NOT availible under OSK or at least the MM/1 version. I have sent David
Graham a message about the problems with the serial drivers. The serial
drivers work fine as they are, they are just lacking in some parameters
that are vidal to FULL MODEM ACCESS. They work fine for use with a terminal
program, but not for the way Bink uses them. Also I ran out of memory and
I also switched to the newer GNU C/C++ compiler. I recently received the
memory expansion bus, so now have to save enough to get the two 4Meg SIMMS
to fill it up. I have shelved that project for now.

Thanks for the insight.  It sound like quite a project.  I hope
I didn't sound like I was complaining, although I am a little
disappointed that it wouldn't run in a generic environment.  I realize
it would be wishful thinking (like dream on!) to find a GWindows version.

One time a few months ago, while "killing time" in a computer
bookstore, I found a book with documentation of the Fossil driver
BIOS INT calls.  Unfortunately, I couldn't justify $44 for 10 pages
of the book.  Lack of support for these calls in OS9000 keeps us
(Mark Johnson & me) from running Binkley and RA under VPC shell.
Too bad, because the idea was to have a Door into OS9000 shell for
registered users.  I would suppose that good documentation of the
fossil driver calls would help in getting compatible OSK driver
support for Binkley, etc. too.

John,
If it's not to complex, we may want to take a look at it.  We
have been experimenting with Ultra C in the OS9000 and have (finally)
had some luck.  The real problem, though, is in VPC (the Dos emulator).
We don't know enough about how it works to consider extending it's
BIOS emulation to support the extra interupts.  And since I don't have
the books or software at my house, I can't be more specific right now.
All I can recall now is finding that the VPC shipped with OS9000 does
not support enough to run a fossil driver.

  What you can do with this code, that is, if the OS9000 has a graphic
package kinda like cgfx, is emulate the cgfx calls. This may allow you to
use MM/1 C programs on the OS9000.
  I'll send you the code and you can take a look and see if it is useful.
The bink code I have has one for UNIX, MSDOS, AMIAGA, and SUN. I'll send
the MSDOS one too.

The OS9000 system uses Gwindows.  We are interested in getting
the development package but as I understand it, if I get the Gwindows
developers kit for OSK I can't do any OS9000.  If Mark gets Gwindows
developer's for OS9000, he (we ) can't develop for OSK.  It's not
worth getting two pieces of software right now.  We may have better luck

 Not quite correct.  (I assume you're referring a 386/486 machine running
 OS9000/386 - not OS9000/68040 running on a Motorola, Force or a couple
 of other platforms.)  Obviously, the same object code will not run on both
 platforms.  But source code written for one OS will compile on the other
 with only a few changes.  The biggest change will be to I/O and you'll find
 that this becomes a 'canned' package you'll be able to slip into the code.

 I've been porting several PD packages to OS9000.  Since I'm doing everything
 in Ultra-C, I'm spending more time converting from K&R (3.2) C to Ultra-C
 than I am porting from OS9/68000 to OS9000/386.  I'm doing the conversions
 under OS9/68000.  But, you can do the work under K&R as well.  You might
 want to look at the source code for STerm I've uploaded.  It's in the 'new'
 library here.

 As to G-WINDOWS, PAGAN has written several games, etc. for G-WINDOWS under
 OS9/68000.  I've been doing the ports to OS9000/386 for him.  Most of the
 stuff is compiling with no or only a couple of changes.  Of course, the
 appropriate G-WINDOWS libraries must be used.  For this, you'll need the
 proper Developers Pack.

 If you have code you've written for G-WINDOWS under one of the above OSs
 and want it compiled on the other, so long as it is to be PD, I'll do it
 for you at no charge.  If it's to be a commercial package, we can talk.

 For those interested, I'm posting all the PD stuff I'm doing here and on CIS
 and will be posting on Chestnut and Washington U.  Postings will include
 object code for OS9000/386 and OS9/68000 and the source code.  Since every-
 thing is done with Ultra-C, the appropriate FPU and CSL modules are included
 with instructions.

  One thing about the fossil interface program, is it standardizes the
graphic calls. Thus allowing the same program to be compiled on different
platforms.
  We are having a BIG discussion with Carl K. about his serial drivers.
they were broke in the COCO OS9 LII, and are still broke in OSK. It seems
he has a thing about FULLY supporting the uart chips he is making drivers
for. For one thing he never added support for DTR in the COCO version or
the OSK version. Both machine's uarts have DTR accessible in the same
registers that contain the DCD. he didn't even support DCD or CTS/RTS.
You have to use a get/setstat call to access these. DTR should be on the
parameter packet, so you can use it just like pause,echo,baudrate, & ect.

 Thanks for your input. I'm just back from Christmas R&R and have to

 I will probably start off getting one that works satisfactorily

Right.  I think the best way, if you are to make it totally universal,
would be to handle all or as much as possible in memory.  Of course,
for something like you are planning, if I understand correctly, the
safest bet is to assume nothing as to what the user might or might
not have.

Hi Dave,
    Your Areaedit came down the OCN pipe and here are my first
comments, maybe my last <g>.  A minor point but the main menu #5
says Delete Echo however it seems to be  Edit Echo and won't delete
an Echo. The only thing I need to do right now is  Delete.
    A more serious problem for me, is the fact that I have a number of
echos which have names much longer than you have provided for. This
really louses up the screen displays that you worked so hard on.
I have some Usenet echos with names like  comp.os.linux.misc.
    I would like you to add, as you said you might, an exit without
saving the areas.ctl file.  I can see running your program with no
intent of making any changes. It seems to display the file faster
than I can change directories and run 'VU'.
    I didn't try, but wonder how easy it is to change the Hub for an
echo. You said you wanted to make sure that a hub couldn't be deleted
from an echo entry. Somewhere in the grey cells I had another 'wonder',
but it seems to have developed a hidden attribute. I'll pass it on
if it comes back and seems worthwhile.

I had thought it COULD be a slow memory problem, but DID suspect the power

but the sensor sure isn't FAST ENOUGH for the 486DX/50MHz!! It seems to be

I have a source for Mac scanners which connect to the SCSI port. I don't
know about source code for formats or anything though.... I guess you's
have to look in the Mac SIG and see if there are any shareware programs
that support a scanner (some paint type programs might) and do some
disassembly. At least they would be in 68K code!!
The hand scanners are $49.95 for an B&W model, $79.95 for color. They come
with a simple B&W paint program... could be disassembled? Is a SCSI model.
100-400 dpi resolution, 4.134" wide. Will run on a Mac Classic or SE, 1MB
of RAM, so doesn't require much. They are available from HSC, 1-800-442-5833
(orders, order part #14809), 408-732-1573 for info.

They also have a video capture device similar to the RASCAN unit for the CoCo.
Uses the SCSI port also. It is only $39.95 (need a video input device...
camera or VCR) part #15012

As for monitor burn in, we have a few with some burn here at the AF base. They
are old 1982 vintage or so WANG green screen terminals. They are only burned
in from 4-6 years of being left on constantly, displaying the log-on screen
. We have more that AREN'T burned in the same age than are. Those people at
least turned the brightness down nights and weekends, the burned ones didn't.
In my opinion, screen burn has always been over hyped. Imagine how many hours
those screens ran with the same thing on the display!! Nights would be 10
hours, plus an extra 28 hours each weekend (10x365=3650+52x28=5106 hours per
yearx4 years=20,424). Now these probably sat some other days, or half days,
with the logon screen displayed. The point is, it took 3-4 YEARS of the exact
same screen (only the time/date changed!) to cause any discernable damage.
And that is on equipment made 10-14 years ago! What do YOU think????

We also have computers that are turned on and off every day. The one I'm
working on right now (I'm backing up the mini computer as I type.. baby-sitting
the tape drive!) is a 1989 vintage Zenith 248. The logic card has been replaced
with a 486SX/25MHz processor card, but the power supply and monitor are the
same. It is turned on and off at least twice daily. Nothing has failed in
six years. We also have some Wang "classic" 8088 computers (they AREN'T fully
XT compatible, about 80%) that have been running since 1982 under the same
conditions, turned on and off at least daily. We are starting to get some
hard drive failures (well, over the past year) now in the old 10MB HD units
that reformatting won't fix for long, but that's about all. Those things
are used as remote terminals for the mini-computer, so they aren't taxed
much. We are getting ready to replace them, however, with 486SX computers.
As remote, dedicated terminals, they have been extremely reliable though.

I often leave my MM/1 and the messydos machine on when I am away

The video output of the computer should "see" the same impedance

Probably so.. although I have noticed on the terminal screens for our lottery
displays here, (they cycle through about 3 or 4 displays for the different
draws, and I don't know the quality of the monitors), you do see the image
of some of the displays on them.  I've always just been one to not take
chances.

It's funny you should mention these.. I believe a friend of mine just
purchased one of these, from some kind of salvage place.  The HD is a
seagate 412, I think, the cards lay down, and would be maybe 10-12"
"high" if they stood up.  I went over to check it out, and while I
was there, a screw came out of the HD and dropped out, and after that,
would not read the HD, I thought maybe the nut or screw dropped down on
the board and shorted something.  The floppy would not read a 360k
disk, either (before this happened).  I think the dealer is going to
swap them another unit.. They gave $200 for it, monitor, and printer.
Actually, I wish they would get something a little more up-to-date,
but they are determined.  I saw a msg on our BBS about a 286 system,
and I believe it has SVGA (maybe VGA), for $400.  This is not very
state-of-the-art, either, but it would be a better foundation to
start from.  Well, you'd have to know them... <G>  But, IMO, they
just don't have anything to work with.  I bet it's the exact same
thing you have just described.

I dunno, if the contest is open to all types of rooms/buildings, I could give
you a run for your money.. We have one outbuilding, about 12x12, where,

What are the specs on the color scanner (i.e., d.p.i. [200,400 or 800?]

     Iv'e been waiting for info on the SCSI digitizer that was supposed to
be in the works since 1991! Now that I'm buying a Macintosh I wouldn't be
too interested. I'm going to be using an Apple QuickTake digital camera to
take digital pictures, it's priced well for the quality unit that it is.
You can store 32 320x240 images, 8 640x480 images or a comination of both
in the 1MB of "FLASH EPROM" memory. I might try making a driver for the
MM/1. The cost is $685.86 from CDW. Does this sound too expensive for the
MM/1 market? Really it could work on all OSK systems. I really don't know
what kind of format the QuickTake uses.

The cost?  Well, I don't know if the people would be in favor ot this or not.
It doesn't seem like all that much to me.. I couldn't just run out on
moments' notice and plop that down, but it doesn't seem out of reach, really.

As for compatibility.. I think the storage format would be pretty universal.
I'd think maybe store it in some standard graphical format, but IMO, that
would only take a conversion - seems like that would be the same across all
systems, and then a series of writes to store on media..  If the scanners,
etc used a standard interface (SCSI?), then I think it could be done with an
application, and not even create drivers.. Dunno

 > know what kind of format the QuickTake uses.

Well, that's me.. I'm totally in the dark on this subject..  I have a
suspicion it might convert the image to some standard protocol.

    Sorry, I didn't realize that statement you made to me awhile back was an
offer. The tools I used to create the graphics are available as shareware,
and they can be used to edit the graphics and board files from GR2 with only
a simple modification to these files. I'd be more than happy to help if you
wanted to make your own graphics set for GR2, and I'd suggest uploading it so
that everyone here that has GR2 could utilize it.

The 330MB HP drive JEM has is a FULL HEIGHT unit. They last advertised it in
Computer Shopper for $159, not $119 (I'm looking at the NOV issue, may have
changed!!). The drive is advertised as a fast 17ms access time though.
Really just thought I'd pont out the price difference and fact that it is
full height 5.25". It is still a GREAT bargain though!! Would work great

Thanks for the info. 17ms is not all that fast nowadays. Most of the prices
I've seen on SCSI drives are in the $.50 per meg area. With prices starting
about 200 or so for a 270 meg quantum. I'm gonna pass myself as I don't need
one right now. I allready have a bunch of full height 5.25 that I wish I

Ted,

Jumping in with a word of advice is not always safe, but, before you install
OS2 Warp on your PC, make sure that it will work with all of your peripherals
and their drivers.  OS2 lacks drivers/driver compatibility for a lot of
hardware and this is where many who have unhesitatingly installed it have
encountered trouble.  Also, back up your data before you install it, just in
case.  No, OS2 is not reentrant. It creates virtual machines and hogs your
memory instead slowing down your system accordingly.  Thus, load high as much
of the system as possible and defrag your hard disk before install.  You might
not have been able to say no, but unless you take precautions, you might say
other "choice" words later! <grin>

Good Luck.

Hi James,
  The early reports, that I read from    2       strickly Windoze Mags, was that
 it
was pre-emptive.  But, as I kept reading more and more, and read what
actual users were saying about the way it runs, I was under the impres-
sion that it was a lot more like OS-9 in multi-tasking capabilities.  I
guess I could be wrong though.  I just do not want to run anything that
has the word "Microsoft" on it or in it.  I do not even do anything in
the BASIC that is in this CoCo3 of mine because it has the "word" in it.
Oh well, I think I am still going to give Warp a go.  I do always have
DR-DOS V6.0 to fall back on if need be.  See ya.

 OS2 is installed now and running relatively well. In fact, I have
installed it on two machines with not too much trouble. Video drivers
semm to be the most problematic as the IBM PS1 I installed it on first
lost its video output entirely until I rebooted and interrupted the reboot
with an emergency exit to a configuration screen where I could (by
default) get a basic VGA driver installed. That PS1 had local bus
video embedded on the motherboard so I wasnt completely surprised that
I had a problem there. My new PC compatible set up with basic VGA
support even though the monitor and video baord had super VGA capability.
Subsequently, I did a partial reinstall and os2 correctly detected the
video board (Cirrus Logic) and installed the appropriate driver. The only
problem is that dual boot crashes when I go from os2 back to DOS now that
I am using SVGA. Fortunately, it gets the HD boot sector rewritten before
it crashes so a push of the reset button gets me on to DOS. Much more
exploration to do...

 HAve it installed now and first impression is that it is pretty neat. The
 desktop is more MAC like than Windows meaning there is no more of these
 stupid Group icons and windows cluttering things up. The icons are for
 devices (e.g. printer) and folders that reveal objects (e.g. text
 document). First speed impression is that it run DOS apps faster and
 Windows apps slower. There are at least three ways to get to your
 windows apps from the os2 desktop and I havent determined which I like
 best yet. You can bring up the program manager from os2 to get a Windows
 look to things (which I dont like) or you can open an os2 object to get a
 window holding a folder for each group that is on your Windows desktop.
Click on the folder and  then the program. Avoids program manager
 completely. I believe that there is a way to put a Window's program icon
 directly on the os2 desktop as well, though you dont get this set up
 with a default installation. This last approach seems preferable to me.
 I'll try this eventually as well as get some time in with the OS2
 applications. There is little documentation for the apps but from reading
 the readme file they seem impressive. Supposedly you can create a chart,
 drag it to a text document in the word processor, drag multiple
 addresses from your phonebook to the text document, then drag the test
 document to the fax object on your desk and faxes will be sent to all
 the addresses. All with the mouse! Well, much to learn. Later...

Please don't feel the need to apologize.  I'm glad to see that you
are still here and active.  I'm still playing around with a few
additions for the Guib series.  Who knows, it might get written
in Assembler.  It would certainly be the motivation I need to
learn ASM programming.  I saw your message on the cocolist.  You
echo many of my sentiments.  I recently picked up an old IBM
Portable PC.  This was an XT lwith a built in monitor. It is a
luggable at best.  Early 1985 I think.  The CoCo, particularly
under OS-9 was an obviously superior machine.  Its a shame that
it had to be sold by Tandy.  One can only imagine what might have
happened if it had been marketed right.  Speed, graphics,
multitasking.  We were miles ahead of IBM.  I see that you are
working on an upgrade to your Shanghai port. (A program which
has caused this monk of little will-power to spend many a
"non-productive" hour at the keyboard.)  Seriously, your efforts
are greatly appreciated.

  This sounds like the reference in CDI magazine, that Philips has designed
and will license a plug-in CD-i card for IBM compatibles. This will allow
IBM compatibles to be CD-i (and digital video) machines. Release is expected
in the 1st quarter of '95.

  Finally, IBM compatibles will be able to do something well!!!

They<philips> have come out with a IBM - CD-I board....so it follows that
they would look for drivers for the different OS,s out there! One WOULD need
a board to run CDI on any system..as is 3DO....Creative Labs has a BOARD for
that format!...@ $350.00 ...

     C pointers,structures, type conversion
     From: BKITT        To: ALL

I have a structure in C where one of the variables is a character pointer.
ie.
typedef struct {
     char _field[12];
     char *_buffer;
     char _length:
       .
       .
     }
I want to specify this structure with a double (or float etc) for the buffer.
ie.
 sample[] =
     {{"ONE"},ONE,10},
     {{"TWO"},TWO,10},
     }
where ONE may be a type char, double, float, int, etc, and TWO can be some
totally different type.
I can marginally get it to work with:     (char *)ONE
But this requires that one be defined as   double ONE[1], instead of what
I would expect: double ONE.

(never mind the above period, that was an acident)

What am I doing wrong with this structure pointer combination????

Many thanks

I'm confused exactly what you want to do.  Are you saying _buffer will
point to an area of memory that may have different data types for
different items?  (So, for one item _buffer may point to a double, and
other times _buffer may point to a short integer?)

  A long time ago, before the cgfx.l library came out, I wrote my own
and based it on the COCO bgfx library. Thus calls such as

cgfx("BColor",08)

or

cgfx("Underline","ON")

As you can see, the varibles are mixed. I think this is what your talking
about. What I used was a UNION. This allow you to setup a memory allocation
where different types of data can be stored and accessed from the same
memory location.
  If you have the K&R book, it explains it pretty well. In the mean time
I will see if I still have the C code for my old version of cgfx and if I
do, I'll send you that part that setups the union and how it was interpid.

I may be wrong here, but I believe that to create the array sample[], you
will have to have all fixed size elements in the fields.  As long as you
define it as a pointer, you will be OK.  You may wind up having to cast it
to whatever type you need in the program.  If the element were of variable
sizes, the program would have no way of computing the offset to sample[x].

 > I can marginally get it to work with:     (char *)ONE
 > But this requires that one be defined as   double ONE[1], instead of what

Again, I think the best way here is to define _buffer as a pointer (you did),
but then you will have to use the address of the double, you might define
            double ONE;
 then when you assign values

  typedef struct {
    char _field[12];   /* better for pointer here - string elsewhere?? */
    char *_buffer;
    char _length:
    .
    .
  } SMP;

The way you defined sample[], you will have a POINTER to the string, to
have the string in the array, do as follows.

  SMP sample[] ={
    {{'O','N','E','\0'},&ONE,10},  /* reference 2nd element by ADDRESS */
    {{'T','W','O','\0'},&TWO,10},    /*etc*/
  }

You will have to develop it more, but I think this might put you on the
track better.

     Ted,

     For   OS9,  I've  found  it  usually  easiest  to provide  a
'semi-bootable'   floppy, or 'system image' this works on several
levels.
     The  floppy  user  can  do a backup from  disk  basic,  boot
somehow,  swap  disks,  and chx/chd. His /dd device will  be  /d0
anyway, so your floppy or an image runs fine in the one drive.
     To make a bootable, a simple script would allow you to pluck
a few vital utils from Master. User formatss and cobblers a disk,
then  dsave your floppy then runs your script which grabs  shell,
grfdrv,  etc  to  clean up. You can combine the  dsave  generated
script with your systmast plucker, and cut a few user typos.

     Hard  drive owners would cram your disk in a floppy, chd  to
it, and dsave /dx /dd ! shell. If the floppy is an exact image of
a  runnable  disk,  the hard drive becomes an exact  image  of  a
runnable   disk!    (plus  all that other crap the  user  already
did)  The  only point of contention is the user  directory  since
there are fairly rigid conventions for most of the dir tree.

     DD, as far as I know:

     junk  or temporary files (readmes, install scripts) place in
root  so they are instantly obvious and easily deleted. Don't add
_any_ perminant files to root!

     dd/CMDS            all execs
     dd/CMDS/ICONS      (cc3 only)

     dd/SYS             system files- termcaps, etc
     dd/SYS/MINE        apps with many SYS files grab a dir

     dd/DOCS            da manual

                       > those who write
     dd/LIB          /

                         /dd/sources/b09/thisthing/code.b09

     dd/USR/*           where the AIFs play. Undefined but
                         typical branches- USR/TCOM,  USR/GAMES,
                         etc...

     dd/USR/*/other     nice  apps  hide weird  files  _beyond_
                         where the user sees the datafiles.

     Applications  have been known to grab extra directories from
root.  This  makes sense on floppies, where /dd/MINE is  all  the
housekeeping  needed. But this is horribly ugly after a few dozen
apps are installed on ahard drive, and positively stops multivue.
Even  if  the  user doesn't use a 'usr' directory, he can  use  a
convienient  dsave  handle  for custom installs. It does  look  a
little weird having an empty dir level on a floppy, thou.

I've tried your program and I see you get erroneous results for
Get_Pixel_Size and Get_Num_Colors.  This makes me feel a bit better,
since lately those functions have been giving me bad results.  I do know
that they used to return valid data.  I noticed something in recent
updates to K-Windows that has me suspect the updates are the problem.
(I won't bore you with the technical details, but it seems to have broke
these two particular functions.)  I'll put in a request that this be
fixed, though!  For now, you'll have to use the _gs_scinfo() call and
use bits-per-pixel to determine the number of colors on the screen.

To my knowledge (and disappointment), the _gs_styp() call has never been
implemented, despite it's usefulness.

Just like you, Larry, I'm always working on something new!  <g>  BTW,

Yes, I do know who's working on K-Windows and I've sent them a note.
Currently, there's a February 1 release date for the latest K-Windows.
A few things have finally been fixed, such as multiple flood fills in
different windows and hot-spots are working again.  An improved keyboard
driver will also accompany the release along with new getstat calls to
give programmers more information as to the status of the keyboard, and

   Yes, I'm back on working on it, adding a few more things and hopefully
   it will be finished up well before Chicago fest. I put the screen
   printer program away for now, the version I uploaded works but the
   program really needs some kind of front end instead of command line
   options. The program should put a representation of the page on the
   screen and allow you to print the picture wherever you want on the
   page. It should also allow you to be able specify the portion of the
   screen that you want to print instead of always the entire screen. So
   intil I get it all straight in what I want the program to do, I'll
   put it away for awhile, who knows, maybe someone else has some ideas
   and wants to tackle it.

   Is there any chance for the hardware horizontal scrolling for Eric ?
   The only thing I can think of now was that question of an interruptable
   ss_play function, no I just thought of another problem that needs
   looking into. Its the problem with drawing grids using the Line function.
   Something is wrong with the routine that calculates the pixel locations.
       If you setup a couple of nested FOR loops that would draw a grid
   using the Line function, the resulting grid would not have square boxes,
   I ran into this when I first started working on the battleship game.

Larry,

    I asked the powers that be about our problem with the Get_Num_Colors
and Get_Pixel_Size and found an answer.  First, I did some research of
my own and both functions always worked when I simple used them on
stdout.  Only when I tried to open a path to an existing window did the
functions return invalid information.  Well, I was just informed that
when you open a path to the window, for some reason for those two
functions to work you have to not only have READ access, but you also
have to have WRITE access.  So, just change the one line in your
wintyp.c program from:
   if ((wpath = open(device, S_IREAD)) <= 0)  {
to:
   if ((wpath = open(device, S_IREAD|S_IWRITE)) <= 0)  {

and it works (although you may experience read-blocking if the window is
"busy" waiting for the user to type something, etc.).  Hope that helps.

Fantastic!!  That BattleShip game looked great!

 > Is there any chance for the hardware horizontal scrolling for Eric ?

No, nothing that major.  From what I understand, the code to support
virtual windows is within K-Windows, but not yet implemented (and thus I
would have to assume it still has some bugs in it).  Of course, virtual
windows (logical window size larger than the physically displayed window
size) is different from hardware scrolling, but before you could scroll,
you'd have to be able to open a window larger than the screen and that's
what a virtual window would let you do.

 > The only thing I can think of now was that question of an interruptable

Someone is working on that, although I haven't heard anything about it
being in the next release.  That is something that we've needed for a
long while.  There may be a few other options as well, like interruping
the current sound to play a sound and then continuing where it left off
on the original sound.  I'm looking forward to that.

Can you post some sample code?  I'll pass it along to the developers to
have a look at, but they need source to show the problem first.  Thanks!

   Joel,
       Thanks for doing the digging and finding the answer. Just open the
   path for both Read & Write ($#%&*%@), why didn't I think to try that.
   I'll write this in big letters on the contents page of the cgfx manual<g>.

       On the Line function problem, I got a program that I thought would
   show the problem, but it doesn't. So now I need to figure out what I was
   doing then that the problem showed up. I thought that maybe some where
   along the different versions of kwindows the problem got fixed, but I
   just tried CIRCAD again and the problem stands out as before. The grid
   lines in Circad are like this:

       ---------
           .       Looking at the screen I see 3 pixels
           .       between these 2 lines
           .
       ---------
           .
           .       While there are 5 pixels
           .       between these 2 lines
           .
           .       This pattern is repeated down the screen
       ---------

   I maybe wrong but I don't think John did the lines this way on purpose,
   instead of:
       ---------
           .
           .
           .
           .
       ---------
           .
           .
           .

91381 13-JAN 22:13 General Information
     Bad MPI???
     From: DBREEDING    To: ALL

Seems my CoCo is getting a little contrary.  I have a Disto Controller
w/4in1, but for RTS/CTS flow control, I have an MPI with RS-232 Pak.

I noticed a little while ago that "pcdos" occasionally would not write
a 256-byte sector..  Then last night, I couldn't get it to format a
disk, it would start to format and then get errors, sometimes 245, write
error, and maybe others..  I unhooked the MPI and connected the Disto
directly and format then worked, and some "pcdos" exchanges worked
also.. reconnected the MPI and no format.. :-(

I have an upgrade chip in it, and have all #8 pins strapped.   Format
did work, so ????  Would dirty connections cause this?  I may be able
to eliminate the MPI soon, when I get my copy if "ix" for OSK, but
I hate to give up error-correction now..

I've seen recommendations for cleaning the contacts, but can't find
them now, so for the 64000th time, what's the best method?  I've heard
that WD-40 and tuner cleaner are no-no's.

Does anyone use software flow control?  It would be OK with "ix" (the
only comm work I'm using the coco for now), unless someone emailed me
a binary file, wouldn't it?

MODEM FLOW CONTROL ???

As far as flow control works, can someone give a brief summary?  I understand
how it works between the computer and modem, but what happens between the
two modems?  I assume that the modem's buffer is finite, and if the modem's
buffer becomes full, looks like there should need to be some flow control
between the modems?  How is this done?  when the computer stops flow from
the modem, does the modem also halt the other modem?  Also, if you are
using software flow control, would the modem pass the XOFF on to the other
system or just allow data to continue as long as it had buffer space?
I would assume that if it kept receiving, that this could possibly speed up
transfers with programs like sterm and ix where they send xoff when they do
a disk write.  I've never seen any of this explained.

   Dom,
       What type of screen are you working with ? If it is a VDG type
   screen,(the 32 column green screen), using GFX there is a GCOLR function
   listed  on page 9-9 in the Basic09 Reference but my book doesn't have any
   info on its use.

       If you are using a window type screen and GFX2, there wasn't a function
   available to get pixel information. I ran into this problem when I wrote
   pacos9. The way I got around it was to use a scaled array that represented
   the screen and when I moved objects on the screen I also updated the array
   to keep track of the objects. I could then detect object collisions by
   looking in the array. You might have to do something like this.

       I don't know if it was ever released, but I think Keven Darling was
   going to have a function that would get pixel info, in the never officially
   released upgrade for OS9 level II. That function might be floating around
   with some of the other upgrade stuff that was unofficially being put out.

     From: WDTV5        To: DOMM

DOMM; Stop me if I'm wrong, but can't we sort of go around that?
By first getting the block the screen lives in, would it not then
be possible to use the LDAXY function to see what palette was there
at the address in question? If it was the same as the nearest edge
of your "sprite", then it seems to me that would indicate a collision
in the past tense. Somewhat more complex would be to surround the
area of the sprite by one pixel with the testing. BTW, DON'T forget
to compensate for the "proportional" on/offs. If its on, then the
darned sprite isn't gonna be where you think it should be in memory.
See the docs for that in "GFX2" by KD. What the prop switch does is
to scale the locations so that a 0-639 and 0-191 h/v in your commands
to draw are scaled to fit a window with less than full screen active
area, like one with scroll-bar borders.

Nothing is impossible in OS-9, except maybe 20 mflops from a CoCo3.
I haven't figured out how to put a 68040 in it yet. 8:)

Unfortunately (?), I'm using a GFX2 640-191 16 color screen.

All I want to be able to do is scan the screen somewhere from top to

I guess I'll look into a scaled array as you suggest?? Sure would be

Gee Stephen - I would be guessing but I think it ha.  The real reason for this
message is to make it
easy for me to reply tto you about Blackjack and the reason it wouldn't run
on the TC70.  Of course I should always read ALL! of thedocs file but...
At any rate I can state positively that the TC70 does NOT have a CLUT.  Took me
quite a bit of digging to understand why my first attempts at programming in
G-Windows just refused to display the colours I was attempting.  For the moment
that's the reason I am guessing.  The lzh package
gives me an executable with CRC $9C1930 size $9302 plus the cards file.
Attempts
to run come up with error 225 which is Bad Parameter.
 Have lots of fun with the differences between the tC70 and the MM1 ("fun").
Wish thay could have been just a wee bit more video compatible.  Of course I am

Stephen -

The original MM/1 version shipped did not support a CLUT.  However, there
is an update (released several months ago) that I believe adds CLUT
support.  Unfortunately, I cannot positively confirm this, as the
(SEVERAL) attempts to send me the update via email have been unsuccessful.
It's been a real comedy of errors -- everything from InfoXpress failing
the download because I had installed a new hard drive and didn't set up
all of the necessary directories, to truncated archives.  I've been too
busy with work and other things to pro-actively follow up, though Frank,
Ray, and Howard have all done their best to get the file to me.  (Thanks,
guys.)

 Ken and all

 Most of the G-Windows stuff I'm posting will require a CLUT system
 so I hope the upgrade provides the support.  I try to stay in the 16
 color limit so even 4 bit color should work most of the time.

 I posted a small utility called 'colortest' that will examine the CRT
 descriptor on a G-Windows system and provide information about your
 system's color capabilities.  The version in the database is for
 OSK.  AKAIK, the OS9000 G-windows supports CLUT so I didn't post a
 386 version.  If anyone needs it, let me know and I'll get it
 compiled and posted

Yes, it works on my Macintosh when I'm on Delphi.  From what Paul
Jerkatis mentioned to me, there is a difference in the way UNIX-variant
zmodem crash recovery works that Delphi doesn't seem to understand,
although Delphi did just recently upgrade their ZModem protocol.

The primary problem with current Unix/OS-9 rz/sz progams is, crash recovery
has to be invoked from the SENDING end.... And Delphi doesn't have an option
to enable recovery from its end... It is possible to hack rz to have a command
line option to tell the sender to use recovery... I've just never gotten
a round tuit. Really old version of rz did have the option, so that would be
a place to look if you wanted to hack yourself...

I don't know if your joystick problem was ever resolved.  But I had a
problem with using the High-Res Interface for my mouse, too.  When I moved
my mouse near the right edge or bottom edge of the screen, the cursor
would simply jump off the screen.  It's like the last few pixels at the
right and bottom edges of the window were not accessable when using the
High-Res Interface.  My problems went away when I used a spare High-Res
Interface that I had.  Other people I knew had the same problems.

Aparently, Radio Shack had made two versions of the Interface and was
selling them both off the shelves.  I bought 3 or 4 of them for about
a $1 each.  Half of them worked perfect.

I wrote Shanghai OS-9 in such a way so that the mouse cursor would not
have to be moved to the edge of the screen.  Some users have the faulty
High-Res Joystick Interface that freaks when the cursor approaches the
right or bottom edges of the screen.

I had the same thing.. got another Interface, might have been a _little_
better, but not much.. my first interface also had a solder bridge shorting
between the 2 buttons, let's see.. when you started a new window, and pressed
the button, the window would go away.  I believe pressing the right button
was supposed to do this, and of course you _were_ getting a right-button
press.. Cutting out the shorting bridge solved this problem, but I had the
"running mouse" problem, too.  Apparently this was a common problem.

  Actually the problem is caused by the slight variations in parts. This
problem can be solved by piggy-backing a very small capacitor (I forget the
exact value off-hand ... .0001 uf?) on the capacitor that sets the timing for
the voltage ramp that is input to the final comparator. The problem is that
the ramp voltage increases too fast and ends before the voltage matches the
input voltage from the joystick.

     Two hires boxes? Anyone have the details?

     I  did  some  hires  munging, and on my  'rip  off'  designs
bumping  the  timing  capacitor up and down was an  easy  way  to
change  the space the mouse used- the larger the cap, the more of
the mouse's travel was used to get a full count.
     For  programs  like  multivue, reducing the cap  to  .015mmf
gives   a  mouse  that  doesn't  roam  very  far across the desk,
but  is  a bit inaccurate. Much more than .025mmf and  you  can't
cover   the  full screen at all. Right around .020mmf you use the
whole wiper and get the best resolution, except the pots in these
mice  are a little irregular at the 'bitter end' just before  the
stop  they  jump around alot- I suspect the wiper actually  moves
off   the  resistance strip and touches the end terminal,  for  a
sudden jump to 0. (full count to the coco).

     I  tried  to  make an adjustable version, and found  that  a
hires  box  set right on the edge would act up, depending on  the
mouse.  Backing off a little bit so the count hit max before  the
mouse   hit   the stops always fixed it. It's  entirely  possible
that  tacking a small cap (.005mmf?) across the cap in the  Tandy
hires box would fix that!

I've been looking for a new SCSI chip for my MM1 - I have a WD33c93 and
need a WD33c93A in order to get HAWKSOFT's audio CD software to work. I
popped into the Amiga forum and was advised that some chips were likely
available in the mask # I need and that I should put the word out on
the usenet in comp.sys.amiga.hardware and comp.sys.amiga.marketplace.
Now I am an internet rookie having access from my office but not here
on Delphi. My question is how to I get a message off to these addresses?
At my office the ususal procedure is to send to SMPT%"internet address" but
these usenet addresses have a different format and I think the office
VAX "postmaster" will return mail with such addresses.

Thanks for getting me straight!

Can't answer your internet question but does your drive handle the audio CD.
Mine doesn't (at least I think it is too old to).  That seems to be my
problem.  BTW, I'm looking for the new(est) chip so that SCSI2 (or is it II)
devices can be used.  I understand that is the hardware change that is required
as far as chips go.

    Unfortunately the 68070/2VSCs combo just doesn't have the processing

    I did pick up Mutant Rampage last week, and now I know why everybody

using the default settings (3 lives per Natural and medium difficulty
setting) I'm up to Level 3 group 3 (Moscow) with 7 or eight lives left and,
if this was my old Atari 2600, I would already have beaten the hell out of
it it's upsetting me so bad. (I've never been a real good sport when it

games of GR2 that I played. :)  )

     CD-i at Winter CES
     From: MREGC        To: ALL


    The bad news is there wasn't really very much that Philips showed for
CD-i at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week that I
found to be very impressive. The good news is neither did any of the other
hardware manufacturers for their systems. There were no new landmark games
on any home console system. If there was a clear winner at the show for
gaming, then it had to be computers. There were some really nice new games
being shown for home computers.

    Probably the most notable thing at the CD-i was that there was a player
running Burn:Cycle, next to that player was a nearly life-sized standee of
Sol Cutter, and then when you looked at the guy playing Burn:Cycle you
realized that it WAS Sol Cutter. The had the actor who played Cutter there
signing autographs. Kinda cool.

    Among the new things being shown at the Philips booth (besides some new
Video CDs, edutainment titles, and conversions of CD-i titles to PC) were
Chaos Control (the most impressive title at the booth, delayed due to a bug,
it should be the next CD-i release sometime early this quarter), Thunder in
Paradise (still quite a ways from being complete, though it looks decent),
CD-i Lemmings (looks exactly like every other version), Flashback (only a
quick and dirty throw together for the show, but it still looked just like
every other version), some unremarkable looking role playing game which I
don't remember the title of, DV clips of Creature Shock, Lost Eden and
Micro Machines (these all, save Micro Machines, looked absolutely
fantastic, particularly Lost Eden), NFL Hall of Fame, The Apprentice and
Dragon's Lair II (these last three are all already available in stores). Oh,
and I forgot about Clue, which has also already been released.

    Not much of anything new that we don't already know about from the last
CD-i catalog or from CD-i magazine. There is also Kingdom: The Far Reaches
coming out soon. Besides this we may not be seeing much new and surprising
any time soon.

   Now _that_ is way cool <g>.  And thanks for the information too!
If you or anybody else here that has internet access, you can check

Tim,  (or other knowledgeable people)

I have installed the Tex system.  There are some details I'd like to
straighten out because I'm not sure the output I'm getting is correctly
sized.

I have an Epson Stylus 300 inkjet that has a resolution of 360x360.
What mode should I use for this?  There's an entry in modes.mf for an
LQ500 at 360x180.  There's also an entry for an NEC laser at 360x360.
Would the NEC mode be the better choice?

In the config.ps file, I'm supposed to define the printer resolution.
The default is 300.  If I use a 360x180 printer for example, would I type
360x180, or 360 x 180, or just plain 360?

So far, I've processed the sample.tex file and printed it using Ghostscript.
The output looks a bit small.  The left and right margins are 2 inches each,
the top and bottom margins are 2 inches as well. The letters are tiny, maybe
on the order of 6 points?  Is that how it's supposed to look?

Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Marty! or anyone else with the info I need, as follows:

I've got an old *old* printer here that belongs to one of my employees
which I need some help with.

The printer is a u-82 Microline (OKIDATA)

This printer has both seriel and parallel (centronics) inputs.  The seriel
port was diagnosed with a bad 75150 in the Busy circuit by me quite some
time back, but I never ran across another of them & haven't remembered to add
it to the order when I was ordering such things from Newark et all.

That employee now has a KayPro 16 (yeah, I know, its Jurrasic too) and
would like to use the printer via the parallel port/cable. Just one minor
hitch in the git-a-long tho, I've done a quick move all the jumpers to the
other side, (some are on A and some are on the B side now) and toggled all
the dip switches to the other position one at a time to no avail. It still
doesn't print. It does thru the seriel if the baud rate is <= 600 so the
computer doesn't over-run the printers limited buffer.

Can someone with the manual for this old dog tell me how to jumper it to make
the centronics (parallel) input the active input?

Many thanks.  Cheers, Gene
