Hi Dennis,
  Thanks for the short history lesson on the 6809/6309 CPU
differences.  But, I do not see how this could explain all of
the crashes I have been experiencing with the 6309.  That CoCo
crashed hard when I simply tried to format a floppy disk!  In
my programming experience, I have not delved into the masking
and unmasking of bits yet.  So, that still does not explain
why a program I write would work fine most of the time and
then crash at others.  I do not think it is the fault of the
6309 either.  I think it is with some other part(s) of the
CoCo.  I had mentioned before that when I replaced the 6309
CoCo with my original 6809 CoCo, I saw a defini                 te difference
in the display on my CM-8.  It is much brighter with the 6809
CoCo.  For all I know, I could have a cold solder joint where
I installed the socket for the 6309.  All the programs I have
written and am writing work fine on this 6809!  I do not have
the proper equipment to run extensive testing on the 6309 CoCo
so it will have to sit collecting dust for a while until I
figure out what I am going to do with it.  I think I destroyed
the 6809 CPU when removing it from the motherboard.  I do not
remember what I did with it.  I may have to see if I can get
another one, replace the 6309 and see if that cures its ills.
If not, then it is beyond my current ability to persue the
problem further.  If it does, then I will get another 6309 to
see if indeed the CPU is at fault.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

Hi Dave,
  The best I ever did with the 6309 was to use PowerBoost and if
I remember right, all it did was to enhance certain things to run
better on the 6309.  I have nothing that will put the 6309 in its
native mode.  I never thought of that when I mentioned HDBackup.
I do not remember if I was using PowerBoost when I did any of the
backups.  I am sorry if I may have misled you.  My 6309 CoCo is
down for the count right now until I can determin what its pro-
blem is.  I am back to using my original 6809 CoCo which I have
had absolutely no problems with.  Talk about a trusty companion!

What is the language of the programs?  Crashing one time and not
crashing the next sounds like what sometimes happens if you have a
jumptable in C and didn't get it initialized.

If you are using Powerboost and B09, I read somewhere that B09 "cheats"
on some of its interrupt routines, I believe, and this is incompatible
with Powerboost.  I know I have gotten some squirrelly happenings, crashes,
I believe, at times, when I hit the BREAK key in B09.  This is running
PBoost in native mode.  I don't think it should cause a problem if
you were running in 6809 mode, though..  This could be the answer to
the fact that crashing is not regular.. Do you run part-time in native
and others in 6809 mode?

That's a little strange.  Most said they saw an improvement.  I can't
say I could tell any difference in mine, but it wasn't bad to start with.

You ought to see what a mess I made of mine.  I completely destroyed some
of the traces.  I think on 2 or 3, I had to use some wirewrap wire and
make new traces.  I didn't expect it to ever work again, but I didn't
seem to have any troubles with it.  You might take the coco apart and
examine all traces very closely and see if any are damaged.

That might be a good idea.  a 6809 is only about $5 and it would
be a good place to start.  I suspect a damaged trace, though.

There were two sets of stuff that came with powerboost.  One set just
optimized the programs to use some of the 6309 codes.  The other put
the 6309 in native mode.  To do native mode, you had to run this one
program on stock modules.  It worked something like ipatch, I suppose.
What I did was to create a seperate directory with all stock modules
and worked on them.  I then created a new boot disk with those modules.

Oh, don't worry about that.  It's hard to remember what you did some

Hi Gene; One possibility that might have an effect depending on the 1773
in your controller, is that at least in my machine, there are some
glitches in a couple of the 6309 address lines that are not in the 6809.
These glitches are quite near the leading edge of the eclock, and for
those devices that latch data on the trailing edge, no problem. However,
edge triggered devices might see those and miss-behave. Its a 6309 problem
that seems to vary from chip to chip. I have a 63C09 here that does, and
I put a 63B09 in Karl Swishers machine that didn't do it near as obviously,
nor on the same address lines! I'm not saying thats it, but its food for
thought, the kind that will have you dragging the scope over to the coco
to check. BTW, my 63C09, glitches and all, is the most stable device
here! In other words, my amiga crashes 10 times for once on the coco.
And AmigaDos 3.1 is in fact pretty stable. I also have some extra gating
in my mpi that may protect the 1773 from them too, but it wasn't intended
that way, just happened when looking for something else.
Cheers Gene, Gene

I'm not a hardware person, but I'd agree, there's something other
than the CPU change going on.  That sounds like something to do
with the GIME.  Good luck tracking down whatever the problem is.

Hi Dave,
  When I started learning to program, I started with RS Basic.  After
getting OS-9, I moved up to Basic09.  I stayed with it for a while
so I could gain a good feel for writing programs.  I decided
that I wanted my programs to be "stand alone" and not have the need
for an interpreter.  I moved on to "C".  I have been using "C"
since about 1991.  DScan, in the database here, is my first and
foremost major project done in "C".  I am quite proud of the
utility and plan to keep working with it as I learn to do bigger and
better things in "C".  DScan is by far, NOT complete!  But, in its
present state, it is very useful and informative.
  The PowerBoost that I have, which was the first out for the 6309,
had no ability to put the 6309 into its native mode, not to my
knowledge anyway.  Like I said, I have not used it for a number
of years now.  The 6309 has ALWAYS run in 6809 mode.
  I am most positive that the problem I am having with the 6309
CoCo is a hardware problem and not software related whatsoever.
I will persue the problem as time permits, or maybe I may just
stick with this trusty ol' 6809 CoCo I got for Christmas in 1988.
I used to read about all the various problems that people were
having with their CoCo 3 computer, one of which comes to mind at
this time, the infamous "sparlies" on the screen such as with a
disk access.  I have never had any of the problems that were re-
ported with this CoCo 3.  I would have to say that if there
were such a thing as a "perfect" CoCo 3, it would have to be
this one.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

Hello Gene,
  If you are talking about my floppy controller, when you mention
the 1773?, my controller is a dual ROM J & R, I think.  I can-
not see the cover because of my B&B HD controller.  My MPI is one of
the older, large case (white), units.  It has a socket for the PAL
with the upgrade installed.  I strapped all pins #8.
  My 6309 CoCo has the 63B09 installed in it.  My plan of action is
to pull the 6309 and heat up the socket pin to make sure I do not
have a cold solder joint and then put a 6809 back into it and see
what that does.  If everything works fine after about a month of use,
I will replace the 6809 for the 6309 and use it again to see if
any problems occur.  If there are none then I can attribute the pro-
blems to a cold solder joint.  If I do start having problems again,
then it is time to get a new 6309.

That is about the same route I took..  I did go to assembly between Basic
and C, but now, I'm pretty much into "C".  I didn't even get Basic
with my OSK machine.  I would have liked to have ported a few of my
coco programs to OSK, but decided that since everyone would need the
interpreter, would steer clear of Basic.  I have ported most of my
more important stuff over to "C".

Heh-heh... Is _any_ program ever complete?  You think you have it just
where you want it and then, almost immediately, you suddenly think,
"Wouldn't it be nice if it would... "

I didn't realize they put out a version that did not support native
mode.  I can't even remember when I got my copy.  It seems it had
been out a year or two.

I must say that I never came across many of the problems that others
have reported.  Did get the BLOB a time or two.  My first CoCo 3
was probably one of the first ones made.  I remember that on the
same day I received my issue of Rainbow announcing the Coco 3, I
went straight to my R-S dealer and put in an order.  It is kind of
funny, it seems that I had just come home from visiting the RS store
that very day and had caught an ad in the new catalog about OS9
Level 2.  I know it was really a mystery what they were talking about
till I saw the Rainbow.

  I would have to say that if there

I've had a lot of good luck with my Coco's myself.  They have been
relatively trouble-free.

In thinking back about this thread, I might ought to mention one thing
I came across.

I have a Disto controller, SC-II with 4-in-1.  However, I had installed
my Multi-Pak so I could use my RS-232 pak, since the Disto serial port
did not support RTS/CTS.  I found I was having trouble writing PC disks
with PCDos.  Then I discovered I could not format a floppy, either.
I tried cleaning my contacts but no luck.  I first thought it was due
to my Floppy driver, since it depends on IRQ's for floppy I/O, but it
would not work with the PC-Dos driver either, and that boot disk was
strictly non-6309.  But removing the MPI permitted both operations to
proceed.  I never pursued the problem further.  I just eliminated the
MPI, since I don't depend on it for telecom any more.

Perhaps your MPI could be doing something in your case, too?

Hi Dave,
  This is going to have to be short since I do not have much
time to be out here tonight, Tuesday July 18.  I normally
log in on Sunday mornings but this past Sunday I went to the
S.D. User Group meeting.
  The only real problems that I have had was with the "bugs"
in OS-9 L2.  After getting new versions and patches out here
I was able to get the OS to perform smoothly.  But, since my
last HD crash I have had to rebuild my boot and find that I
am having some of those problems again.  I get lost and/or
garbaged characters in the forum messages, I lose my cursor
after leaving Mail and the Internet, etc.  All I have to do
is try to remember what I did before.  Since I have all the
patches and new versions archived on floppies I should have
only minor problems in ironing this out.  Oh well...
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

Hello again,

  I agree that the posibility is there that the MPI could be at
fault.  But, I was using it with my 6809 CoCo long before I ever
decided to go with a 6309.  I had no problems hardware wise that
I can remember.  Like I said earlier, this CoCo has been more
than trustworthy.  Come to think of it, the only hardware pro-
blems that I really have had were my HDs dieing on me left and
right.  Maybe someone (Tony D.) can invent an IDE interface to
the CoCo.  Then I can just buy a new one and not worry about it
for about 5 years or so!

Tell me about it!  I simply lust after a local dial-up number.  I think
I've already mentioned that I live in a very small rural area.  We
have just gotten a local newsreader service, and rumor has it that
our telephone co. is supposed to get an internet link here sometime
this summer.  I don't know the nature of it, but if I can TELNET to

From what I have been able to gather so far, Netcom uses the TCP/IP protocol
with either SLIP or PPP via modem. From what I recall, the NetCruiser software
works only with Netcom and I don't know if you can use more "standard" software
with Netcom or not. Best ask them about that.

I'm somewhat surprised there isn't an Internet service provider within
Delaware that uses standard SLIP/PPP software. Speaking of which, has anyone
written networking software based around SLIP/PPP for OS-9/6000 or OS-9000
yet?

Porting code without reading it is exactly how I found this! :o

I was fooling with the enormous GNU P2C pascal-to-C translator and

Here's one place that caused trouble in the file trans.c:

#ifdef OSK
    if (useAnyptrMacros)
        charname = "Char";
    else if (unsignedchar == 1)
        charname = ucharname;

     KWindows window format
     From: TEDJAEGER    To: ALL

Hi All,
        Been trying to figure out the native (DSNAP) format of a saved
to disk KWindows window. Have used Joel's demosnap to save the screen
and then dumped it to examine it. Looks like the first $3C bytes are a
header and I would guess that 16 of them (its a TYPE 0 screen) are the
palettes. Anyone know what the bytes in this header represent? Thanks!

 OK, I'm talking to myself but have learned a bit. Takes 48 bytes (3 per
 palette) to encode the palettes. They are offset $0a to $39. I also
 discovered SnapIt, an utility distributed with the MM1 upgrade to
 OSK version 2.4. It works like demosnap except it does not do any
 compression. This makes it handier if your purposes are simply to
 display a KWindows screen so that additional software may grab a
 section of the screen and save it into a disk file in a format for
 loading into a buffer for future PUTing on a graphics screen. Yup,
 that's what I'm doing! Good luck

Sorry I didn't pick up on this thread earlier.  Let me know if you want
me to post demosnap's format.  I may also have a utility which lets you
save a portion of the screen (you use the mouse to rubber-band off an

Hi Joel,
        Yes, I sure would like the scoop on demosnap's format. Here is
what I'm up to. I wrote a little game called SLIDER that is a knock off
of that old hand-held game that had a wooden frame with a 3X3 matrix
of numbered blocks within. One cell was empty and you had to move the 8
other numbered blocks around to get them in proper numeric order. Got it
all working and then realized that it would be nicer if I could put a
graphic in the 3X3 matrix and let the player move sections of the
graphic around to get the parts of the picture in proper order. So then
I need some way to grab a section of an iff or gif or bmp image that
matches the size of the 3X3 matrix. Since the game currently runs on a
Type 0 screen, I need a way to grab a part of such a screen and save
it as a disk file that I can gpload. If your utility would do that and
you can find it, I'd appreciate a copy. In fact, the more I think
about this, the more I bleieve I should probably revise the game to
run on a Type 3 screen so I can get 256 colors in the image, no? Not
much work, I think. Thanks

Ok... DemoSnap file format:

Offset  # Bytes  Description
======  =======  ======================================================
   0        4    Header for file ("DSNP")
   4        2    Total number of horizontal bytes per line
   6        2    Vertical size (in lines)
   8        2    Number of colors (16 or 256)
  10       ??    Palette data in triplets (RGB) (size = num_colors * 3)
  ??        1    Compression byte.  ($00 for uncompressed, $01 for RLE)
  ??       ??    Image data

For uncompressed image data, the image data is exactly as it should be
stored on the screen.  In other words, if you had the memory address of
a properly sized screen, you could load the image data like this:
read(path, screen_address, bytes_per_line * vertical_size);

For RLE compressed image data, bytes are read from the file two at a
time.  The first byte is the byte to be stored on the screen, and the
second byte is the number of times the byte should be used.  This
continues until end-of-file is reached.  So, if you read in the two
bytes $3C and $05 you would write out the byte $3C five times to the
screen.

It is possible, (At least on the older, pre-pop-top models) to hook
up a terminal, and get into a "service shell"... Also,with the proper
disk, you can actually boot OS-9 and have a regular shell, with all
your familiar commands... Boisy was able to do this by makeing a CDRom
that had a copy of his MM/1 HD, and the proper boot modules for the CDi
player... Of course, you need access to a CDRom burner to do this...

Yes, there is.  I've only tried this on a Philips CD-i 220 player and
a Magnavox 910, so I don't know if it will work with the smaller
450/550 players.

You need to construct a cable to go from the 8 pin mini-DIN port on the BACK
of the CD-i player (labeled IO/2) to a 9 or 25 pin RS-232:


        Below is the pinout of the IO port, an 8-pin mini-DIN.


        Facing male 8-pin mini-DIN connector:

             (top)

            6  7 8

           3  4   5

             1  2



pin       signal     I/O
------------------------
1         nc
2         rxd         I
3         txd         O
4         nc
5         ground
6         cts         I
7         rts         O
8         +5V (200 mA max.)




        The following connections are needed to interface to a DB-25:


signal  8-pin mini-DIN             DB-25
----------------------------------------
rxd           2                      2
txd           3                      3
ground        5                      7


        Also, tie pins 6 and 7 on the 8-pin mini-DIN together.  This will
assert both CTS and RTS.


Once you have constructed the cable, hook it up to your CD-i player and
a terminal.  Hold down the space bar on the terminal while powering up
the CD-i player and you should see a diagnostics menu appear where you
can run simple tests.

With a special disk, it is even possible to call up a shell.  I have
such a disk, which is loaned out to someone right now.  Their intention
is to duplicate the behavior of the disk and possibly make copies for
sale.

 Stephen I am not sure if it can be done, but I would THINK it's possible,
 and if I remember correctly, this is what Boisy did recently at one of the
 fests(correct me someone). Either that or maybe he had his MM/1 hooked up to
it.
  If you find out how to do it, let us know how the show works out. I hope more
 clubs follow the example of the SD UG! This is what clubs can do to keep OS-9

 The answers very much depend on what version of OS9 (OSK) you are using.
For a CoCo3 running L2, no, you can not remove and replace system modules
that are in boot on the fly. Though it is not very convenient, they did have
a good reason for limiting this on L2.

 However, for your specific request, it is possible to change the a disk's
device descriptor on the fly by using dmode (available here in the DBs). The
procedure would be to make sure nothing has an open path to the disk (CHD,
CHX, etc.), deiniz the disk a bunch, dmode the paramters (tracks, heads, etc.)
then reiniz the disk. However, with some hard drive systems, this can lead
to problems. For instance, you can not directly dmode the total sector count
and park cylinder on B&B descriptors.
 If this is a permenent change, it is best to build a new boot disk.

 There should be a PD "save" command, or five, lurking in the DBs here.

I had to resolder mine and after working a couple of years in industry with
a wave solder machine, I think they did a crappy job on the board.  Probably

 Heh, heh, as I recall, I used to try real hard to make those big
ugly solder joints on flybacks.  If you leave any sharp edges sticking
out, you can get a "corona discharge" -- little blue pinpoints on
high-voltage/high-frequency connections.  Causes an ozone odor and
interference. ((A spark being your basic all-frequency transmitter)).

 The real blame for the problem is manufacturers depending on PC-board
solder joints to hold heavy things in place.

 The instructor always said - "first make it mechanically sound -- then
solder it".  ((Wonder what he would have said about "surface mount"
components)) GRIN

 NEW RULE - "If you can drop it on the carpet and hear a `thud', it
shouldn't be held in place by solder."

A properly made PC board will hold "heavy" stuff in.  They should have used
those little "feedthough" holes like on multilayer computer boards.  Yank on
a lead though one of those and the board will rip before the solder connection
breaks.  A small eyelet would probably do.
>The instructor always said - "first make it mechanically sound -- then
>solder it"
You don't know how many times I cursed out someone who does that when I had to
repair some electronic equipment because of faulty wiring or failed part,
especially the old tube stuff.  Even bending the leads on a part on a PC board
makes it a pain to repair.  Thank goodness wave soldered boards do not follow
that rule.  As I said before, the problem with the Maggies are not that the
transformer is too heavy.........they just didn't solder the thing in correctly
in the factory.  Every one I've seen looks like a board full of cold solder
joints.
Something was not done right at the factory.

Maybe, I've got 2 of them here in front of me, and 4 more maggie built
commie 1084s's. Some are as high as 9 years old now without ever having
the lid lifted for anything. One only had some mechanical damage to the
din plug joints on the board brought on by our overly tight cabling run
and trying to move it with the cable plugged in. Out of those 6, none
has had an H.O.T. come loose. So lets here it for all those maggies
that are still out there plugging away without any thanks from their
owners!

Well, I guess you were lucky.  Could have been a run of them that were bad.
Mine had the occasional blink that turned into the screen going blank for
longer and longer periods of time until it went out completely.  I opened it
up and found the soldering was real crappy on the whole board.  I guess mine
must have been made: 1. Monday, 2. Friday, 3. by a new person on the wave
solder machine (grin).  Actually what you have told me, it adds to my theory
that the failures are due to bad soldering rather than poor design.

Oh! Yeah!<grin>......
To talk of arcing<G> I did an alarm not so long ago!@@#$%!!!
a Dry Cleaner......Someone put TWO bricks through his two front <Large>
plate glass windows!...so I come in and put in a GlassBreak detector!
To replace the OLD tape used!,in doing so I took out some old ciruits!
....Following the tape by 1" was a "NEON tube".............
 the thing falsed! I found the tape was ARCING to the window frame.....via the
metal screws used to connect the wire to the tape! the problem was the blocks
were VERY close to the frame,removing the wire brought on the other problem!
the ARCING interfered with the GLASSBREAK....<audio>.....causing it to go off!

Now the latest! I have another alarm story!<grin> during the July 4th...
a BAR close to me got burged! they got in through a door on the side of the
building.....and trashed it some what! the place is very old!anyway! they did
not
trip the PIR/Micro in the hallway!<?????>so I talked to the guy who owns the
Bar! and put it all together!Shee! he was a customer of many years!in his late
70,s........need I say more!.....WE just installed a NEW system <FREE> to
replace his OLD 15 year old system!
I had told him HOW to use it<he tripped it a couple of times>I came out 3 times
to show him how! I had mentioned on how if he wanted he could turn on and use
the * + 0 quick arm...user setup!
he used it!!!!! WITHOUT turning it on first!..HE! must have known how it worked
..it beeps when you turn it on.and a red LED shows it armed..when you come in
there is a tone till you turn it off!......

He complained to me that he had to do his code ...TWICE...cause it BEEPED the
first time!........ARGGGG!  he never called us!NOW! he wants to sue cause
according to him it did not work!
if you arm it,anyway..it BEEPS..and the ARMED light goes on!
IT would NOT have BEEPED ....and NO led would have lighted up! NO light..no
BEEP no WORK!............

     Registered Users: COCO 3 Emulator Update
     From: JMURPHY      To: ALL

XPOST from JeffV

This is a general announcement for registered users of the CoCo 3 emulator...
a new version 1.42 is now available containing a few bug fixes.  Here's the
summary:

* disks beyond 57 tracks now possible without uncontrollable .DSK size growth
* double-sided OS/9 disk format now supported in the manner previously claimed
  in the documentation (the bug that prevented it from working is fixed)
* compatibility problems with Tseng Labs SVGA chipset hopefully eliminated

*If* you can handle uuencoded .ZIPs through your email account, please email
me with your registration number and I will forward the updated package.

Please feel free to spread this post to the GEnie, Delphi, and other relevant
discussion groups.

For the information of users who cannot receive the updates by email, I am
composing a notice to go in the mail, which should go out sometime after
Rick's picnic.  With the exception of the OS/9 double-sided disk problem,
the other two bug fixes can be applied using a simple patch procedure which
will be documented in the notice.  For non-emailable users who wish to receive
the full upgrade, I'd like to ask for a small $2 S&H fee to cover postage and
a blank disk.

     Installed RAM?
     From: 01GEN40      To: ALL

Hello one and all,
  Well, I guess it is now my turn to ask for help with a pro-
gram I am currently working on.
  The program, among other things, requires getting the memory
block map.  The program is being written in "C".  I need to
have it determine the amount of RAM that is installed in any
given CoCo 3.  This way I can have the memory black buffer
array set for each amount of memory encountered.  I do not want
to have a fixed size.  I would then have to have for different
programs for the 4 different RAM sizes.
  Any help would be most appreciated.  See ya among the stars...

LONG LIVE OS-9! <FOREVER> ** In whatever form it is in!

Peace and Long Life...

Home system is:

2 meg CoCo3, 3 floppies, 130 meg scsi, 8cm515, 12" amber run by wp-rs in
the mpi, dual 232 pack SCII(with 4n1), WP-RS. V32.bis modem, seriel
mouse. Running nitros9, a mixture of various modules/versions as a
bootfile. All except the monitors are running on a pc power supply
so even tho the coco has 2 megs in it, I can bury it under paper
without any heating. Printer is a Oki 24 pinner.

Work office system:

CoCo3, 512k, mpi, B&B-XTRTC with 10 and 20 meg drives, 2 floppies, CM-8,
std mouse (hires), and a diablo 1650-RO printer.

Other work system:

CoCo2 with the "missing chip" acia added, 2 floppies, 5" b&w monitor
on a "video" kit. Runs os9L1, and a B09 prg I wrote that works 200%
faster, and has 20x the storage available than the $20K Grass Valley
Group "E-DISK" that it is emulating. This is the system that proves
a coco2, running os9L1, can handle com rates of 4800 baud WITH the
right hardware. The interface is packetized, but the only handshakes
are at the start and ends of a multi-kilobyte transfer. No cts/rts or
xon/xoff used! No mistakes either.


Please describe briefly your computer and OS-9 experience:

My first computer was an RCA 1802 based Super Elf. I wrote a production
(tv) related utility for it that was still being used 10+ years later.
Next a pair of Z-80 based "MicroProfessors" were made into an ATS for
an fm radio station.
Next, a TI99/4a, still have it, thinnk it still works but hasn't been
powered up in 9 years 'cause I found the coco (old grey ghost, still
have it, runs last time I checked) and os9. That was about 85, the
rest as they say, is history! I also bought an Amiga 2500 a year ago,
but use this coco3 far more than I do the Amiga. I'm working on getting
a permanent cable between them so I can use the Amiga's editors on
really big os9 proggies!

Please describe your OS-9 interests (things you would like to see the
UG do, or see in the MOTD), or list any other questions or comments:

1: More publicity of the kind the choir might not see. The choir being
        all us dedicated users that frequent the comm nets. You don't
        have to preach to us, we're converted!
2: A discussion of some of the more recent findings in the 6309 area.
        Since we are still occasionally finding new things it can do,
        like the tfr 0,r thing. Dedicate about one page hi column to
        each feature, and use them for page fillers when the adds or
        other editorial leaves some room.
3: Go electronic with MOTD like Jason Compton has with his "Amiga Report".
        He publishes on a 2-3 week schedule, lha'd its still over
        100k at times per issue. See the amiga sig here, "dat rec" for
        the latest copy. He is not very technical tho, and a new edition
        for those folks is in the first or second issue stage right now.

Gee, if you are asking that question, then you haven't been using Vaughn
Cato's latest versions of ansifront with your C compiler. Actually it isn't
a lint, but it sure does a heck of a job of type checking and other things
on your codeing efforts. A true lint, no, a lot of help, yes!

The only lint I know of for OS-9 is Gimpel Software's lint.  OTOH,
Ultra C with warnings turned on will warn you about a certain amount
of stuff.  (The only bothersome thing is that iopt gives warnings in
terms of intermediate code symbols, which can get renamed to avoid
clashes in some cases.)

Opinions herein are solely those of their respective authors.

I too saw the adv for it from Gimple. Or Gimpel. I didn't know if the
"garded" source would be compilable on the CoCo or not, so I haven't
bother the fone company with any calls about it since it appears to
also cost at least an arm and a leg, neither of which I'm quite ready
to spare for just the love of it. I love this machine, but there ARE
monetary limits too.

You too, eh.  Got a little over 100 here (Saginaw, MI) yesterday too.
It broke a record, and a bunch of air conditioners.

I don't know how hot it was on the factory roof I was on, but the
tar was not sticky - it SPLASHED when I stepped in it.  I hid under
a 100 Ton condensing unit for a while just for the shade and the
breeze coming into the fans.

BTW - if you smack that beeper hard enough with a hammer, it will
stop doing that.  ((When you find yourself coming up with ideas like
that -- its time to get off the roof)).

 Has Kevin returned to being the sole Kwindows developer, or is he just in for
the MM/1B Port? I knew he had returned to being active with Kwindows somewhat,
bnut never knew to what extent. An OS-9000 port would be mint, if only the UG
could pull off anoth
er
 $350 deal with MW again to coincide. Ahh, well enough daydreaming<G>

 Really, I hope Kevin does get such a port finished, for the MM/1B, since if
 the machine is going to be pushed as a solid low cost entry level Developers
 machine(which is what it comes across as to me), I would think Kwindows is now
 the way to go(over MGA). It may not have a HUUUGE base, but one that is
considerably bigger than it's gui competitoright now.
 And windowing is the way to go. I personally wouldn't see the point of
upgrading
 to OSK only to stick with termcap programing<Grin>.

 Btw, I hope these machines your pumping out do go over well. My advice? Begin
 broadening the scope of your market and don't be visible in only the Coco
market(maybe you have already started this).
 By now, the coco users who haven't switched over, probably aren't in any rush
 to do so. Stay aggressive enough to let your prospective customers know you are

 here when they are ready, but also look into other places to carve a
nitch(hobbyist market, etc.) and possibly get a few $$ out of this!

 Good Luck(and hope you got my email)...

 >>I'm considering some specialty areas...<<

 This sounds like a great idea, and it stays true to the OS-9 marketing
tradition of niches.

 I was mentioning to a few people, the idea of a MM/1 Unit with CD-I (MM/1-CDI)
 that could be used both as a developement system for CD-I titles as well as
 a CD-I Player. It's a possibility and would be great to see, but it would
 be for one thing, at least a slightly different hardware setup(completely
different Video hardware) than
 current MM/1 hardware setups, and the software would be vastly different. I
 would expect you would need the addition of Rave(possibly  under K-Windows)
 plus many specialty modules. If such a machine was made, I can see a market
for it, even if the price goes from $3000 on up, considering, from what I last
read, people(companies) were paying Philips something like either $6000 or even
 over $9000 for a developers kit to build CD-I titles. With this system you
 would possibly  have a bigger market, and a greater amount of software being
 written, plus the ability to run current CD-I softwre, once you had the
 major obstacles cleared(like getting it to run on  SVGA system rather than
 television).

 That's enough for dreaming... :-)

My MM/1B is not exactly expensive.  $445 buys the basic system (a kit
really, motherboard and software - but 68000 none the less.  And OS-9/68000
beats the heck out of 6809/6309 OS-9 anytime - based on the software
improvements and the lack of the 64K address space troubles.

definately not in a hurry. I've got a screwdriver here that works fine &
it's still in relatively good shape. I really don't think that it needs

     MM/1 Module Upgrading
     From: KNOT1        To: ALL

Hi there.  You might recall I've been trying to get my MM/1 up to
speed.  I have pretty much all original modules (e.g., windio #17).
Well, my Coco finally passed away on the 3rd after near continious
running the good part of a decade. *sigh*  Well, I've gone and grabed
all the updates I could find in the data bases, but note many of the
files listed as supposed to be in them aren't.  In particular,
'xmode,' which the docs say I have to replace, isn't there.  Was there
some other release no longer there that used to have the 'missing'
files, or were they not actually updated so no needed?  Still on a
'personal' system, but liking to get up to speed all the same. :-)
Perhaps an 'mdir -e' might help me know if I have everything current.

   It's not nearly so comprehensive as you might think.  It covers
the basic X/Y/ZModem and Kermit in considerable detail.  The theory
chapters do cover `all of the multitudes of ways to calculate CRC's',
and complete implementations are given as well.

   One of the biggest motivations for writing it was my experience
authoring terminal programs and finding that good, accurate docs
for the common file transfer protocols was hard to come by.

   If there's enough demand to warrant a second edition, I'll try
to add others, but that's very hypothetical right now.  I've enough
other book projects to keep me busy for quite a while.

     MM/1 fried mouse (/t2?)
     From: JEJONES      To: ALL

Well, I think I've done something stupid...

I turned off the MM/1 last night--a thunderstorm was passing through.  I
turned it back on this morning, but was less than ept, because I didn't push
the on button far enough to make it engage the first time.  Things powered
up fine once I used the switch as it was meant to be used--but now my mouse
is not responding.

Turning it off, letting it sit, and rebooting doesn't appear to help.  I
had a spare mouse and tried it, but no go.  Have I fried my mouse and /t2?
(I hope not.)  I expect that I will try hooking the mouse to /t1, xmodeing
is in.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

  It could be the 68901 chip went south.  I had something like this
happen a while ago with my 68681 chip failing..  What happened was,
I forgot to pull the phone line from the modem one night in a bad storm.

  Well, I thought the modem was fried, changed it, still no go. I also
have a second T3 board I tried and still no go.  I sub'ed the 68681
chip and all worked.  I put the other parts back, one by one, and tested
them.  Found out the only thing that blew was the 68681 chip!

  So, after you try the other port with another mouse, try replacing
that 68681.  Ya never can tell just what might go bad with lightning
and power surge's...

     OS-9 Late Night:Reminder
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL

         This is another reminder. Tomorrow(Monday) night at 10:00 PM
       Eastern time, we will be having our weekly conference "OS-9 Late
       Night". This week will be an open forum so come in an talk about
       anything. If it gets to dull, fear not, I'll just make up some
       nasty rumours about people to keep things interesting  O;-)

         Also, if you use OS-9 Levels I or II, than NEXT WEEKS (7/24)
       Topic will be of special interest to you. Mike Rowen, who is the
       OS-9 Users' Group Vice President of the 6809 users will be on hand
       and discussing potential future projects as well as what is going
       on right NOW. This will be a good opportunity to voice your
       opinions to Mike as to what you would like to see done by the UG
       and to also GET INVOLVED. Judging from the Sourcebook entry forms
       I've recieved so far, a great majority of you indicated that you
       would be available from time to time help out on projects, so this
       is a great sign. I personally encourage Mike to take this into
       account and to set up some activities so that we as the USERS of
       the UG can get the wheels turning. I hope a lot of you are on hand
       so we can begin to add more productive activity under the umbrella
       of the UG. The Sourcebook is a start. Let's take it from there.

         And let's not forget, that the week following that (6/31) will
       be our big D.A.V.I.D conference. This is really shaping up pretty
       good. A temp account has been opened for Dave Kimble, and a
       posting in either the sign-on or sign-off banner is a possibility.
       I won't know for sure until about a week before the conference, as
       that is when I'm supposed to send in my request to the one in
       charge of the banners. Mark your calendars!

         If you have a conference you would like to hold, just leave
       Email to me and I should be able to get you on. Take it easy
       everyone!

     IX is back in action
     From: DIGIGRADE    To: ALL


      Well guys, after spending 3 months getting aquainted with my new
Macintosh, I have decided to give equal time back to my MM/1. I have
powered up InfoXpress again and found requests waiting! Well, I had to
delete most of them because people think your a real dweeb responding
to a 3 month old message.

      Anyhow, part of why I'm back on the MM/1 day to day is because
Delphi readers for other machines are grotesque. Allthough I haven't
tried Rainbow for the PC. I would have to emulate it with SoftPC and
that would be too much trouble. I have to thank you again Bill for
such an awesome mail reader! To think a program this useful is actually
on OS9/6809 is hard. The like hasn't been seen for allmost a decade.
Exactly the reason we need other super-useful packages on OS9 and OSK.
If Max-10 gets ported to OS9 and OSK it will be a marvel. I think it's
time I started that DTP project I have been wanting to do. The biggest
reason we can't get this kind of basic app. done is because people are
afraid of type-7 screens. This is exactly the screen mode we need to
use in a DTP app. Anyhow, now that we have all that great stuff from
Joel like the Clipboard Library and the scaleable font stuff (wich I
don't have right now) I think I can throw a decent Max-10 replacement
together. Not that it will be anywhere near as usefull or easy to use.

I am going to start the FMV game soon as well. BTW Chris Hawks? How do
I CDI disks to work with CDF?

I tried again with the same results. I get 44032 bytes of 116791 and then up to

All of this is from a Mac running Zterm. I have uploaded this same file to CIS

This is what I got when I switch com programs and dropped the baud rate and

### Send (x) CDL_V2.LZH: NAK on sector
th# Send (x) CDL_V2.LZH: NAK on sector
### Send (x) CDL_V2.LZH: NAK on sector
### Send (x) CDL_V2.LZH: NAK on sector

This happened at about 43K, the same place as before. 'I' think that I have run
into a bad sector on delphi's hard drive. Perhaps you could check on this for

While that would sound logical on a single user system, with a single
disk drive, I think that it would be highly improbable (perhaps infinately
improbable) that you whold hit the same bad sector continously on
Delphi, with is many, many users, and mutiple disk/system clusters.

Have you tried going through a different network, or calling Delphi's
direct line? I would suspect possibly a network related problem.

     Bootfix
     From: REVWCP       To: ALL

Dear friends:

While looking through some of my patch files, I found the following,
it was named bootfix.

The first patch is to make the system boot up at 6ms.  I don't,
however know what the second patch, for os9p1 is for.  Could anyone
help me out with this one.  Also, if any one knows who wrote it, please
let me know.

    l boot
    c 00c0 03 00
    c 017c 13 10
    v
    l os9p1
    c 05b7 cc 4f
    c 05b8 00 5f
    c 05b9 02 39
    v

It was called fixboot in my archives, but I don't know if that is the
proper name or not.

Bro. Jeremy,  That patch you have is part of a file here in "system" database.
Do a sea boot or sea os9p1 and you will find it along with a couple others.
I looked at them but decided that those patches will be left to Nitros.

Hope this helps. Keith

He wrote:


...Putting OS-9  in  ROM  is  fairly  simple.  Basically, there are two
changes that need to be made.  The first change fixes a bug in  the  REL

included script ('rel.pat.')...........

This was the first that I had heard that there was a bug in REL.  Can
anyone enlighten me more on this?

     RE: Rel (Re: Msg 93068)
     From: RANDYKWILSON To: REVWCP

Bro. Jeremy

 This isn't a cause of a bug. It's more a case of teaching an old dog
a new trick. REL is the first thing run when starting OS9. Disk basic
loads the kernel *track*, including REL and Boot, at address $2600.
REL, in this code frag, is checking to see where it is in memory, and
copying itself up high if it isn't there already. The check is needed
so that the copying isn't done on a "single-reset" reboot. Note that
the $2600 is hard coded.

 The problem is that code in ROM is not going to be at $2600. It will
more likely be at $C000. The original test is okay, but the hard coded
$2600 start address has to go for ROM usage. Mike did a cute trick of
modifying the position test so that it picked up the actual boot track
start point in memory, used this for the test, then dropped through
(via the NOPs) to the move code with the address intact.

 This patch is only needed for using OS9 in ROM, but will work with any
system. We are talking having the actual OS9 code in ROM. It is not
needed for autobooting ROMs like B&B or Puppo or ???. They mimic (or
use) DECB to load at $2600.

     AlphaSoft - Warp1
     From: DOMM         To: ALL

Is there anyone else out there who uses AlphaSoft's Warp1 for OS-9
telecommunications? I have been using it for quite a while with no problems
but have a condition that seems to ellude me so far. If I use the buffer
to screen capture and then list -- it gives me a double spaced list.
I've tried tmodeing, xmodeing everything I could find but haven't gotten
a single spaced list so far. (I'm assuming that where alf=01 gives auto
linefeed, alf=00 would disable.(?)) Any thoughts?

I also tried to find Keith Alfonso with no luck. Member name ALPHASOFT
gives Keith's name but when I try to EMail it says no such member.(?)
Is he still around to be contacted?

Sounds like it's keeping the LFs as well as the CRs.

If it's saving the stuff to a file, try dumping the file so you can see
exactly what it's saving.

The best bet is prolly a proggy I got from here, call "tr".
Usage syntax is "tr 10 13 filename" which will convert any linefeeds
in the file to cr's. Or look for a lf stripper util. I find I can't
handle even the uue style files here without first converting it.
Thats a problem when I use rz to dl a .uue file, it seems to wanna
convert any cr's in the original uuencoded file to cr-lf combo's.
uud then barfs.

Saved the buffer to disk...used kwikzap to inspect..and the saved capture
file has LF's included. This file gives a double spaced list as does
listing the buffer under Warp1. If I use "fixtxt" which illeminates LF's,
The file of course lists OK with Tmode lf.

Everything is Xmoded to alf=00. Interesting thing is that if I view the
file which gives a double spaced list when viewed from term or shell
overlays...with Mike Sweet's "ED" text editor---it lists OK.

Some how when I{use the buffer to capture, LF's get thrown in. When
viewing the original telecomunications screen, the listing is OK.

How can I stop  LF's from being tacked on?

     RE: AlphaSoft - Warp1 (Re: Msg 93082)
     From: RANDYKWILSON To: DOMM

Dom,

 The LF's are orginating with the host. It's a MSDOS world out there, MSODS
uses CR/LF combo, so most telcom uses it also. Standard OS9 terminal programs
automagicly tmode the screen to alf=00 and therefore expects the linefeeds.
SuperComm acts this way, with a option to internally added the linefeeds in
the event the host doesn't send them.

 So your problem really isn't in your telcom, your host, or your screen
settings. It's in your terminal program. It should be stripping these linefeeds
out before it saves the capture to disk. Again, SuperComm does this.

I've been using Warp1 for a long time and I guess I just got to o accustomed
to using it. Now that you point out SuperComm, it seems using that would in
most respects be the way to go. I like being able to view the capture buffer
as does Warp1 but SuperComm has more control options.

And anyway...I know who to contact when I have a question about it! <G>


One question I have presently is: Whats the best way to change the colors
SuperComm uses so I can match what I use now? (I have just scanned the doc

I don't know as you can. I solved this a long time back by writing a
quick and dirty little thing in Basic09 that copiesn the file byte by byte
UNLESS the byte is a linefeed ($0A) in which case its thrown away.
I originally did it so's the basic09 listings I was doing weren't dbl
spaced later, AND because when basic09 does a "save" it also uses
linefeeds. Linefeeds as you know, may well drive your editor into doing
weird things, my code was big enough that I needed to get around it "vi"
style, so I wrote the stripper. BTW, you can then feed that file back

into basic09 with a load, it doesn't seem to care that its linefeeds
are missing on the reload.

One exception Randy, when its running the external rz, no strip. So all the
uue stuffs I move have to be stripped before I can uud them. That doesn't
take long, but it is a pain in the drain.

How do you change the size of the sectors (i.e. 512 and 1k)

Under OS9, you have to open the whole device to do it "raw", and this
will NOT get you the 1773 data it uses for sync and track id info.
To open the whole device, append a "@" to the end of the devicename.
Seeks etc then have to be done starting from byte 0 of the device.
Hope this is some help.
