Ribbs/OSK module revisions.


In this archive you should find the following Ribbs/OSK modules that I have
worked on in both source and packed form:

1. RiBBSMain
2. LoadConfig
3. SetBaud
4. Connect
5. Chat


 I have made changes to all of the above modules to get Ribbs/OSK up and
running much better.  The included text file buglist.txt list a number of
bugs that I have come across, and the fixes that I have made on some of
them.  I suggest that you take a quick look at it for more info on what
works and what might not <G>!

 Just copy the NEW modules to your Ribbs/OSK CMDS directory and try
them out!  I have removed the 'fixer' from park.bat (should not need it
anymore)!


   A quick summary of some of the bug fixes:


1. Ribbs/OSK can now configure the port properly.

2. It can now answer an incomming call and get the proper baudrate for the
   call.

3. Some errors in the "CONNECT" module when reading the ribbs.cfg file was
   fixed which also fixes some bugs when Ribbs/OSK delays for the LOGIN
   delay and the CONNECT delay.  Before the fix Ribbs/OSK would delay for
   more that a full minute between the LOGIN and CONNECT delays

4. The CHAT function no longer gets 'stuck' on the remote user's end, and
   it 'beeps' at the sysop when paging.

  
   I hope that I have 'REALLY' squashed the above with no negative side-
   effects.  Let me know of any problems that you have!



*NOTE ON HANGING UP MODEM* 

   Ribbs/OSK has to hangup the phone by sending the hangup string to the
modem.  I have found that for my modem I need to put some pauses in the
hangup string or else my modem will NOT hangup, especially at slow baudrates!

In order to get my modem to hangup at 1200 b.p.s., this is the hangup string
that works best so far:  ~~+++~+++~~ATH0|.

The "~" means pause for a second and "|" is a CR.

My modem needs to see the +++ twice for some reason before it will go to
command mode, thats why I have it two times.  When you choose goodbye from
the menu, Ribbs/OSK will dump the goodbye message, and thats where the
problem comes in (at least for me).  If the message isn't completely dumped
before Ribbs/OSK sends the hangup string my modem will not hangup and
Ribbs sees the CD after it restarts.  The above hangup string works for my
modem as slow as 1200 b.p.s. but I'm not sure about 300 b.p.s.!  All the
one second pauses REALLY slow down the modem initialization process (5 secs
for the above), but it helps when its time to hangup!

                    Ribbs/OSK Beta Bugs list and fixes.

                     Jan 23, 1995  Wiliam R. Chapple.


   Here is a list of the bugs that I have come across so far, and the fixes,
               if any, that I have made to correct them:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   No matter what baudrate the modem said it connected at, Ribbs/OSK
     would select 2400 b.p.s.

FIX: Corrected the problem in the "CONNECT" module.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.   Ribbs/OSK could not properly configure the I/O port by it self.

FIX: Corrected the problem in the "LOADCONFIG", "CONNECT" and "SETBAUD"
     modules.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.   Ribbs/OSK just sat there after sending the "Press [ESC]" message.

FIX: Corrected in the "CONNECT" module, it was set to accept "m" instead of
     as ESC.  You must now press ESC from (remote) terminal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.   Ribbs/OSK will crash if you enter your password incorrectly and you 
     re-enter it correctly when Ribbs gives you another chance.  Once you
     press ENTER, it will suddenly bomb.  It gets stuck is an error loop
     with error #43 in login.

FIX: NONE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.   The "CONNECT" module was calling rbwait with incorrect parameters.  I
     think is should be calling "SETBAUD"?? But not sure.  The REMed it out.

FIX: REMed out the bad line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.   "SETBAUD" was getting stuck.

FIX: Corrected by removing "CLOSE" statement which was closing the I/O path
     that was being used for I/O to the modem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.   Ribbs/OSK would delay for over one full minute after connection was
     made, before it would send the "PRESS [ESC]" message.

FIX: I found in the "CONNECT" module that two variables had not been
     DIMMed.  They were throwing off CONNECT when it read in the config
     info from ribbs.cfg.  I DIMMed them so that would match rconfig, and
     that solved the delay problem.

     Other problems that were related to the above, was the BBS NAME and
     SYSOP NAME was incorrect, along with other varaibles.  All fixed now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.   When "DUMPFILE" dumps a file and the "Press any key" message appears
     it will not contiune no matter what you hit on the remote end.  It
     seems to ignore remote input all together.  You must hit a key locally
     in order for it to continue.  Also when you do hit a key locally and
     there is someone connected remotely, there is a VERY GOOD chance that
     ribbs/OSK will crash! I have tired ENTER and SPACE BAR with same
     results.  Two errors can occur:

     #1 ERROR #000:102 (E$BusErr)  A bus trap error  or
     #2 ERROR #000:103 (E$AdrErr)  An address trap error.

FIX: NONE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.   When user paged sysop to chat, the page message would appear only
     once and then the remote user would be stuck there, because nothing
     he would hit would make CHAT continue.  When a key was hit locally
     chat would continue and enter chat mode.

     Also It made no sound when paging sysop.

FIX: The "CHAT" module was calling the "inkeys" program to get input, but
     inkeys will not return with a null string (It waits until a key is
     pressed).  I replaced it with INKEY and GET.

     I added the BGFX("BELL") command to make chat beep when paging.

__________________________________________________________________________



     Other things that occur randomly are:

     Sometimes Ribbs/OSK will get stuck in a error loop or will re-start
     when user tries to Quit Ribbs/OSK.

     I am using two ZOOM modems 1 2400b.p.s. v.42bis and one 14.4k b.p.s
     v.32bis.  Sometimes my modems would not respond correctly to the
     command strings being sent to them, so I slowed down the speed at
     which ribbs/osk sends them (put a very short pause between each
     character being sent to modem).  It is 'built-in' the "SETBAUD"
     module.  This solved the problem.

     Ribbs/OSK has to hangup by sending a hangup string something like
     the following:  "+++~ATH0|".  My modem needs to see the "+++" twice
     before it goes to command mode, and at slow baudrates ex: 1200 baud
     I need to insert pauses in the hangup string like this:
     ~~+++~+++~~ATH0|  This makes initialization of the modem slow, but it
     will hangup after displaying the goodbye message.  Have not tried at

Warren,
  I received a list of bugs from William Chapple.  Unfortunately, I don't 
have (or accidentally deleted) his email address.  Could you relay the
following to him?
 
From bug list dated Jan. 23, 1995

bug #4 - I had the same problem - I loaded the logon.b file - packed it - it
ran just fine (gave 4 chances at password, then went back to menu).
Maybe your packed logon module is an older one.

bug #8 - dumpfile bug - It doesn't happen with my revised dumpfile.a. Would
he like it? Or will it get to him if I send it to Randy Wilson?
-------------------------- End crosspost ---------------------------------
     I will reply to Calvin's msg via E-Mail UUCP Internet.

William,
    I have the official up3.lzh you can download from private downloads
in my e-mail msg base.  Also get the updated buglist and hist files, use 
those names.
    I have been successful getting my 2400  modem to answer over /t0 so
far.  The new logon.b fixes the password wrong entry bug and if you
delete the 'press any key [ctrl b]' from the welcome, bulletin files you 
will be able to logon, read mail and logoffj.  I still havent got my
modem to hangup even though it sends the +++ ATH0 to the modem.
Maybe my register with the excape char is changed, have to check.
    Calvin Dodge has a fixed dumpfile to cure the cntrl b hangup and it
will be included in up4.lzh when released.
    Good luck, Warren

William,
     I checked out your setbaud and setbaud.r1.b you just uploaded.
I found neither would hang up my modem when i had the ^R in the hangup
string with /t0.  I did find that not necessary to set /t0 to noecho as
if I do it gets all goofed up.
    BTW the packed setbaud and the source 'setbaude.r1.b' are not the
same.  Your readme said your archive had setbaud.r2.b so must have
gotten it goofed on your end.  I do hope you can get it to work with
both /t0 and /t3,/t4 ports.
    So for now will just have to stick with the setbaud that I found to
work CRC 862FA0, size #1718.  Forget which source this is from but was
previous to what you just sent.
    It is necessary to xmode /t0 baud-2400 however.
Warren

William,
     Forgot to mention that I have gotten my modem to hangup with the
up3 update setbaud that is one you sent in ribbsmods1.lzh.  I used a
hangup string 'tilde+++tiled tilde+++tilde tildeATH0|'.  But a new bug
has cropped up.  If loging on as a new user and filling out the
application the C chat will work as a Q and log you off. Q will give you 
the 'logoff with msg to sysop' and bomb out.  Only previously entered
users can log on and get all the chars in a menu to work..  So got to be 
something in the userlog and userindex that gets goofed up now.

Tim,
    I just received two msgs that I originally posted here.  Seems that
net/node 343/210 reposted them and they look like they orginated on his
system.  I could tell by the AMSGID  and the seen-by line where they
came from.
    Anyway, RiBBS_OSK is really looking good.  It will now work with
either /t0 or /t3 on my system and with my 2400 or ZyXEL at 9600 baud.
Callers are amazed at how fast it is working.  More to follow ----

  Hello David (if you're out there)...
 
 I mailed your Delphi account regarding my MM/1's repair status a few
days ago, but I'm not sure it got through. So, hopefully you'll catch
this message.
 I sent my machine (all CPU boards) to Kevin Pease in early December,
but I have heard no word from him on whether or not it was received ok.
(Hopefully it's not in mail purgatory somewhere). Could you ask Mr.
Pease if he got it ok?
 
  thanks,

Tim,
     I guess I was responding to msg you posted about loosing msgs.
As for RiBBS_OSK beta we need more help with the Fido part and since you 
have Fido working on Maximus and can cross test between your Max system
and RiBBS_OSK using a null modem or even two modems it would be easy to
test that way.
