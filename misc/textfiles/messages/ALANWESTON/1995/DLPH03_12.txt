The problem seems to be that the file itself (the executable cbdemo) inside
the archive appears to have been damaged BEFORE it was archived. It is the
proper length (according to the size within its header) but the last part
of the file seems to be junk... Frank is working on resubmitting a new
archive, which I will move as soon as I see it is here... I'll also make
sure I do a full extract, and ident this time to make sure everything is OK.

  Lets see if I can get this right :).  There's a version of lzh
on the 6809 side that did things differently and the OSK version
couldn't read the archive so, 207 came to be.  But, the 207 version
would try to read/extract the 6809 version wothout you telling it
to do so.  Well the 208 version has a flag that you can set to
tell 208 to do it if the flag is there.  I think I got this right <g>.

I was going nuts trying to remember where I did get that... I did get

  Anyway, I'll upload a copy of it here and another one I just found

  After unarchiving the file, doing a ident gives the correct file
size but the CRC's is what is trashed with E5E5E5 :).

  So, chopping the file down is no good.  This tells ya that the
file really is bad :(.  I wouldn't want to `fix' it and try running
it <G>.

Would that be the Matt Thompson version?  I know that caused quite a bit
of confusion.. <G>  I have 2.01 and 2.06 for OSK.. So far, I've been
able to extract anything with one or the other.. may need to get one of
the later versions for just in case, I guess..

No, seriously.. I've seriously thought I'd also like to have a "mainstream"

been able to justify purchasing one..  Of course, as you said, they're

A CD-ROM would be the main thing I'd be getting a PC or Mac for.  It's really
fascinating to see what they have done with the graphics and animation.

I'd like to stay with OSK but none of the 68K machines I've seen have the
speed for CD-ROM graphics like the PCs. If I skimp a little on a monitor,
I could have a pentium 90 or 100 with quad speed CD-ROM for under $3000.
I do believe that I can get OSK for a PC, at least I recall reading that
here. Its still elementary right now. Yeah, I'm a traitor but I held out

I'd say if you want to go mailorder, you should be able to get it quite a
bit under $3000.  I don't know about quad-speed.. I don't know about the
future, but I've seen a couple of reviews and articles where they say that
as of now, you can't really realize the extra performance from a quad-speed
CD-ROM, but possibly with a high speed Pentium, perhaps it would be worth
the difference.. You might look into it.

RE: skimping on the monitor..  I'd suggest don't.  Go with the very best
you can stand. I think you'll be very glad you did.  I got a 15" monitor
(the cheapest one I could find).. It does very well, has a good display,
but sometimes I wish I had a 17".

 > Yeah, I'm a traitor but I held out

I was just kidding about the traitor stuff <G>..  Yes, before I got my OSK
system, I did some serious looking at PC's and Macs.  If you have a specific
need, and must depend on canned software, perhaps it is best to go with one
of the "mainlines"..  I decided that for my purpose, I would be happier with
an OSK machine.  I must admit that I do, on occasion, look wistfully at
a PC doing all that fancy graphics animation, but OTOH, I tire quite
easily of stuff like that, so it would probably be something I would play
with a week or two and then drop it.. so I dunno.

Depends.  "N-tuple speed" CD-ROM drives are really only N times as fast
on large sequential reads.  When you start doing random access, their
advantage falls off fast.

     coco3 problems
     From: THIB         To: ALL


 Ok.. I have been using my coco3 off and on for 7 years.. the other day I was
having the usual difficulties booting the damn thing
 (locking the HD during boot, etc.) and then the video started messing up
 and reset wouldn't fix it, neither would power down.

 so i figured the thing finally died, and pulled the STILL IN THE BOX spare
from it's storage space..
 Here's where this story get's obscure..
  I wanted the new one to be 512k.. so I pulled the board out of the old
machine, and started looking for the.... ? that I clipped
 per the 512 instalation guide (that I did 10 years ago)
 but don't have now.

 now the questions..

 A) what IS involved with installing 512k on a coco3    and
 B) since the new machine and the old one did the SAME exact thing after
installing the board.. what is the problem with this situation?

 any observations would be appreciated :)

I had the same thing happen to my system some time ago.  Mine would do
this intermittantly, so I could not figure out if it was the computer,
the MPI or one or more of the paks plugged into the MPI.  Does you
r problem occur without any thing plugged into the bus?  Mine didn't
at first, but then even all by itself it would.  I tried the usual
reseating the GIME, cleaning all the card edges and even swapping
out RAM chips in the 512k upgrade.  It baffled me so much I was about
to give up and buy a Mac.  Well, I ended up buying a new (used) coco3
and MPI from an ex member of our club, installed the 6309 and 512k,
and now the 2 meg upgrade, strapped the IRQ lines in the new MPI
and everything is fine.  I still don7t know what caused the problems.
Oh yeah, did I mention that I even bought a new GIME?
I'm not positive on this, so wait for someone to confirm, but I
THINK you have to clip out C64 and C65 from the coco motherboard
to upgrade to 512k.  I don't have my copy of "Tandy's Little
Wonder" handy, but those numbers stick in my mind as the ones.

Yup, Murphy has a corrolarry about that no doubt. However, it will still
help here in that it would tripple the available speed thru a null modem
over to the Amiga. I currently make around 650-675 cps either way when
logged into the cable at 9600. I've shipped the latest version of 'pf'
over to the amiga and back about 15 times now in the process of getting
it to compile on both machines. Which I have, it now compiles with
SAS/C 6.51 on the Ami with only two lines in the header of two files
changed! Which I'm fairly proud of, not to mention the CoCo code was
cleaned up quite a bit by the error msgs from SAS/C! Of course its
bigger too. which can't be helped too much unless I wanted to redo
it in asm. Thats someplace less than a -1 priority tho.

I guess what I really like most about CW is that it's so easy to copy,
even with horrendous conditions. For example, one night I was having a
CW conversation with a gentleman in Washington state on 10 meters (just
above the CB band). All of a sudden his signal darn near disappeared and,
to make matters worse, the noise level increased heavily. I never would have
been able to hear him voice but we were able to continue the conversation
with CW. Granted, it wasn't easy but we managed. I certainly learned real
quick that it's much easier to copy di dah dit dit in the mud than it is
to copy voice.

Morse code isn't really that hard to learn either. It does take dedication
and a positive attitude, though. The really rough part is trying to increase
speed. Given 30 minutes each day, you can go from 0 to 10 wpm in about two
months. If you're into "instant gratification," you'll never get to 13 wpm.
Honestly, you get stuck at 10 to 11 wpm and you think 13 is impossible no
matter how hard you try. I got stuck at 11 wpm for about a month and couldn't
copy 13 wpm no matter how hard I tried. What was really strange is that
one Sunday afternoon I was copying 11 but falling on my face at 13. The
next day I could copy 13 wpm like I'd been doing it all my life. There are
a few hurdles like that at various speeds. I found the first one at 13 wpm
and the second one at 15 wpm. I'll shatter it eventually and move on to the
next one, which I hear is 18 wpm.

Yes, I can see where it would be very useful.  I think it would really

I have a morse thing for my coco.. I got to where I could do a _fair_ job

I was hoping to meet you, but forgot to specifically tell him to be on

he saw you, but didn't think about it at the time.  He said something

It seems it might have been a few years ago when you met.  I don't know his
call letters.. His mailing address is Liberty..  He is a close friend of
Rick Cooper, who publishes CoCo Friends Disk Magazine (CFDM here on Delphi).
BTW.. did you know Rick was planning to hold a mini-cocofest this spring?

Actually, if it hadn't been for Mike, we would have let it slip past had he

Yes, there's a lot of them <G>..
I'll try to get his call letters.. I think he has a repeater going, or is

Actually, I could use JNOS (which I use for Amateur packet radio) to
retrieve news/mail just as well as the other software. This would log in
with SLIP/PPP, retrieve mail and news using the POP3 and NNTP protocols, and
log off.

What you may be missing is that SLIP/PPP accounts are not a "part" of
Internet (at least not in a real sense of having a permanent connection)
but it feels like it. There's so much you can do with a SLIP/PPP account
that you can't do with a login account, many times it's easier than using
a login account, and FTP transfers are actually faster. Consider the case
of getting a file by FTP here. First you FTP to the site, browse the
directories, and transfer what you want to your workspace. Now you have to
remember what you got, go to workspace and download it. With FTP on a
SLIP/PPP account, I point/click to transfer files directly to my computer.
No middle man.

As far as software goes, you might check the version of NOS that was ported
to OS-9 to see if it supports SLIP. I know several people in the CoCo mailing
list use it.

     Programming Question
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL



         I have picked up Basic09 again and started resuming work on my
       Delete-like Protector utility I have been working on, and once
       again I'm back with more trouble. First off in this version I'm
       working on, I've changed it around a bit. The big change is that,
       in the original version I used the option switch '-s' after the
       command name to indicate that the filenames would be coming from
       Std-Input(keyboard), and the '-f' option to tell the program that
       the filenames to protect from being deleted were coming from a
       file(such as one created using a command like "ls!filelist" for
       instance). My original problem after that was that if input was
       being piped in, I needed to set up a syscall so that my program
       would know to expect it. To make things simpler, I acted on advice
       given to me back when I was getting help on this the last time,
       and got rid of the '-s' and '-f' options and kept just the '-
       ?'(for help screen) and '-v'(to make it verify before deleting).

         What I did was set up the program so that that it would run the
       syscall after starting and would determine what the std_input
       device was(RBF,SCF,Pipe) and then set it up to act accordingly for
       each, which does come across as much easier. Now I have one
       problem. Everytime I run it, I get an error 55 which is a
       'subscript out of range' error. I get it at the 'IF' statement
       that tries to determine if the std_input is from the
       keyboard(SCF). The statement is:

         'If Optbuffer(pd_dtp)=0 then'...

         I set the variable 'pd_dtp' at $00 which is where the call
       begins reading in the PD.Opt section, and am wondering if this is
       something real trivial. I can't seem to get it figured out :-(

         The (long) source listing is going to be in the next message if
       anyone wants to check it over and see what I missed.


         Thanks...

     From: RANDYKWILSON To: THETAURUS

Chris,

 The offsets into data structures given in the OS9 manuals are just that;
offsets.
They are not the element number. The difference is a bit subtle. It's much
like the difference between the Basic BASE 0 and BASE 1 structures.  BASE 1
means the first element is #1. BASE 0 means the first element is #0, or more
correctly, an offset of 0 from the start.

 And this is exactly what is tripping you up. You explicitely set BASE 1,
then use an offset of 0 (pd_dtp) when accessing the options array. The correct
answer is to use BASE 0, but this may cause hassles elsewhere in the code
(haven't looked close yet). The EASY answer is to set pd_dtp to 1.

Charlie,

 I would think, based on the B&B, that an IDE interface and drive can be done.
But I would also guess that the few people capable of the feat will not be
interested. There just is not enough market left.

 On the other side of the coin, SCSI drivers and interfaces are available,
and SCSI drives aren't that much more than IDE. I just picked up a 730megger
for $300.

I want to add my 2 cents to your post and say that, due to its flexibility,
SCSI will soon be the standard interface in the computer world.

     From: DBREEDING    To: VAXELF

John,

Here's something you might try.. What you would probably want to do would
be to make a "bstart.a", much similar in approach to "cstart.a".  Here's
a thing I came up with.  I don't know if it's accurate or not.  If you want,
and are really interested, you might play around with it and see if you
can get anything going.  I'm not sure if this approach will work or not,
but I feel something like this is what you would need to do.. This might
need to be corrected some, I just did it quickly, and not having Basic,
can't test it.  See what you can do with it.  As I said, it's something
I threw together in a hurry.

---------------------- cut here -------------------

 use /dd/defs/oskdefs.d

Edit equ 1
Stk equ 0

 psect bstart_a,(Sbrtn<<8)!Objct,(ReEnt<<8)!1,Edit,Stk,_cstart

* If you use the standard library modules, you will have to fake the
* "data area" and fake some of the global variables, "errno" for one, and
* maybe some more.. if you compile and get unresolved refs for any of the
* variables defined in cstart.a you'll have to define them.. Ummmm, just
* thought of something, if you allow stackchecking, you'll have to do
* something about the stack checking stuff.. define these variables, also,
* and maybe a fake stackcheck routine..  Might be easier to always compile
* without stackchecking..

* You might want to define your "a6" offsets here.
* NOTE: Since these are defined outside a "vsect", they are not data

 org 0

 ds.l Your "link a6,#0" position

* Heres's a trick to do if you want to use the standard LIB's

errno: ds.l 1 Fake errno (or you might be able to use this for error checking)

* Might need to define other standard global variables, too


_cstart:
* Make space for fake "errno"  You might need some other globals
* here, also.
 subq.l #4,sp

 link a6,#0 Need to point "a6" to fake "data" area

* Now call your "main". You don't have to call it main, I'd
* call it bmain (as below).  Note, argc and argv don't apply
 bsr bmain

 unlk a6 Restore a6 & sp
 addq.l #4,sp Restore stack to original
 rts

 endsect

--------------------- cut here ----------------------

Now, all your variables will be passed as parameters.

You may need to check how Basic passes parameters.  In 6809 Basic,
you have starting at the bottom of the stack,  PCount, addr(p1), len(p1),
addr(p2),len(p2), etc.   If this is true, then you will have

 bmain( pcount, p1addr, /* anything that was passed in a register and
                            not stacked. */

    a6link, bstartreturn,
     p1len, p2addr, p2len, p3addr, p3len... etc)

Otherwise, you need to omit the p?len, I'd guess

the len's, if applicable, would be int's, the addr's would be char *
or int *, depending on your app.

   Great, I can't wait to see what your working on. I also hate to say it
   but I will probably be going over to use my brother's ms-dos machine to
   come up with the sounds. He owes me anyway, I just got done writing a
   super-duper golf tournament scheduleing program for him. I had written
   one for him a few years ago, but it was hardcoded for 16 players and
   4 rounds. This year he says he needs one for 20 players 5 rounds, so
   this time I wrote the program to be flexible as far as players and rounds,
   so I won't have to do it again.

   Ok, I'll plan on the keyboard being an option, now I need some pointers
   on how to do it. When any key is pressed on the keyboard, is an event
   generated ? Would I use _ev_signal(), or just check _gs_rdy(), or set
   up an intercept() ? The new _gs_keysns(), does it support all the keys
   or just the number pad keys ?

     Pentium SNAFU

Hi All.
        My home includes an IBM clone along with my MM1. Thought I'd
share the fact that the clone had the bugged Pentium so I called to
get a replacement. The new chip came about a week ago and after installing
it, I find that my PC won't even pass its boot up self test. Switched
old and new chips four times. Consistent results--either I live with
the FPU error or its nobody is home when the power switch is flipped.
I have both my MM1 and clone play a WAV file at bootup which is my son
telling the "You know why Intel didnt call the Pentium the 586...." joke.
Of course, I had to phone Intel to report the problem with the new chip,
and, of course, the Intel guy wanted some info on my system which required
me to boot up..... He didn't laugh.
