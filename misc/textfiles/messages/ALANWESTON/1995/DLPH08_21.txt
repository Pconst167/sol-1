Gene,

 Correct. Supercomm only knows enough about zmodem to spot the start and
fork off rz or sz. From there on, it's rz/sz's ball. The only control
Supercomm has is to kill off rz/sz at the operators request, under
certain conditions.
 We were specificly talking about ascii captures, but SuperComm will also
toss out linefeeds if it feels an xmodem/ymodem download is ascii text.

That's in the listing of the buffer only?  I had the same problem with
OSTerm.  You can turn off LF's, (at least in OSTerm), but then if you
want to view it on the screen, it keeps overwriting the single line,
until a true LF is sent.

There are a couple of solutions.

1. use a utility to strip out LF's
2. For screen listings, set tmode -lf for the screen
3. Use the command "merge" instead of list.  This won't
   work for the printer unless you have it set to not provide its
   own linefeeds.

If you want to use option 1, don't have a LF stripper and cannot find
one, let me know and I'll send you something I wrote.

You can write one in B09, but it is rather slow.

Hello Gene,
  I do not know to whom this message should be directed, so I am
sending it to you.  A while back I wrote a utility that will take
any text file and strip out any and all unwanted characters.  I
wrote it in such a way that the output can be redirected to the
printer or to a new file.  It can be sent to the screen but there
is no pause capability in it.  It also paginates the output.  If
wanted, I can put together a little DOC file and upload it here.
let me know.  See ya among the stars...
  Ya know, I was just thinking.  I wonder what it would do to an
executible file.  I think I may see just what it will do, might
prove to be quite interesting!  I will let you know.

Might try another option.  I don't know if it would work for the CoCo or
not..  If you have VED, You might try loading it into it.  I know the
OSK version (2.0, anyway) will strip out the LF's, you can save it
in DOS format if you want, but without specifying, it will save it
without the LF's.. It's late tonight, I won't try now, but you might give
it a shot.

If there's no linefeed strip here, I wrote one in Assembly.  It does

Yeah, but zmodem is *supposed* to handle that too. Pity it doesn't when its
controlled by the sender and told its text mode stuffs. Its not a huge prob
to me, but I expect there are those who *are* a bit put off by it.


Do you have yet another vversion in the works? One item I'd like to see is
for the next version of SC to drop the echo into a black hole for the
duration of an ascii text send, I think it gets confused by trying to
process the echo *sometimes*, particularly when the file going out is
larger than 32k or so. I'd like to see some scripting over and above the
dial.adf file allows too. But understand I'm not squawking too loud, I
also use most of the comm proggies on the amiga, term43 at the moment, and
SC *STILL* does some things better!

An executable? Well, first, it will change all the machine code references
to the extra register sets to an illegal opcode, or a different one. In other
words, the resultant will fail 2 ways, first being the crc check that os9
*normally* subjects anything it notes is executable when its loaded to
do a F$Fork or F$Chain to. Second, is that the modified code will no doubt
crash spectacularly. The reason I used the '*' above is that there are
util/patches for os9 that do turn the crc checking on/off, part of a speedup
patch set for Nitros9 for instance. 1.22 itself will probably default that
to off. I have mixed feelings about that myself, but then disk drives have
become about 10-3 times more dependable in the last decade. I have not had
a hard drive data error in over a year that I didn't create! Floppies here
are still in the so-so category though.

Correct of course, I was asleep too! I think the same can be said for the
patchkit that makes 'vi' outta 'TSEDIT'. It will show you a ? as the first
character in the line IF its a linefeed riddled file. I spose if the file
had lf/cr instead of cr/lf's then the last character would be displayed
as a '?'. Anyway, when I see that, I just exit without saving, and use my
stripper on it.

And.... for yet ANOTHER end-of-line fixer....

I recently downloaded a file called "autolf.lzh" from chestnut
(before it quit letting me in -- ??).  Autolf converts
any DOS/UNIX/OS-9 text file to the format you specify.  The
archive contains source, and compiled executables for DOS,
OSK and 6809/OS-9 machines.  I even got it to compile on
my OS-9000 critter.  -- Not bad.

The author is Mike Tozer - mike@vk3.demon.co.uk

Also, Bob Van der Poel's "VED" handles all the end-of-line
formats - and lets you convert them if you want.

That's a good choice.  I used it some (I was kinda hooked on OSTerm, though)
and it does have some good features.  As with everything else, there's
a thing or two that could stand some fixing <G>, but it is a pretty
neat comm program.

Not familiar with FIXTXT, does it completely strip out LF's?

Seems to. Don't know that much about it except that it works easily.

Actually, I seem to have a another problem with getting it completely
working corectly. (Randy?...Anybody?...Help!) I'm sure its not SuperComms'
fault.

First, am I right in assuming that when SuperComm connects, it
kills the overlay and sounds a "TONE" signaling connection? It seems
that it did this at a few times. (?) Well...it doesn't anymore. I tried
everything I could do to repeat the situation but......

Mine stays at the box until you press the spacebar. No connect tone either.

Also, I can't get it to auto login. Maybe the two are connected someway?
There is still a small "echo" problem as stated to Randy earlier, that
hasn't been completely scoped out yet. Can these things be tied together
or are they different problems. Or is some modem command out of wack?


ANY THOUGHTS?

I could check it out myself.  Actually, this would probably be the easiest
way to do it..  All you have to do in the OSK version, the latest, at
least, is to make one change in the file and then save.  The version I
have does not save unless something has been done.. If there are CR's
at the begin of the file, I just delete one of them, or just hit space
and then backspace and that'll do it.

Right now, it only is set up to act at a internet service provoider... Delphi
actually has a seperate system set up for the Beta testers to log into. I
believe that the future plan will be to allow full delphi access. Right now
at least you can telnet back to delphi.com and access your standard Delphi
account. I'll try to keep ya all informed as I learn more...

BTW, I have no idea why I was chosen as a beta tester... perhaps cause I am
part of a SIG staff, or perhaps I signed up for the Internet sig the first day
it was available... it sure is fun testing a new thing though!

No Ken, sorry to say, it is PC/MSWindows based. Mac version is planed, but
a lot of other folks will be outa luck... But, from what I can tell, if you
had a PPP driver, and Netscape/Mosaic on any other type of system, I don't
see why it would't work with the new planed service, you just wouldn't
get the "Delphi Shell" which is menubar interface to the bundled packages.

I've been meaning to try to connect to the beta service with my Sun and

Can't you use SS.DevNm ($0E) for that?
    reg.a = [path #]
    reg.b = $0e (SS.DevNm)
    reg.x = ADDR( 32-byte buffer for name string)

After calling GetStatt, to Basic09-ize it, you need to find the last char
in the devnam string, clear the MSB, and append an $FF

I think C is really neat.  I was truly impressed by B09, it has some
really neat and powerful features.  The biggest gripe about it was
when you wanted to write multi-module programs, and tried to pass
a complex data structure between them, then you had to redefine it
for each module you wanted to use it in.  This becomes quite a
hassle for complex programs.  With C, if you want, you can define
all variables in one file and use this file for all files.  Just
takes one little trick..

Give it a shot and see what you can come up with.

What will be returned, remember, is the device name with the MSB
set.  You will need a routine to parse the name... Could you use
F$PrsNm (or is it I$)?  Anyway, would it point to the last character?
Then you would have to POKE    LAND( PEEK(that location), $7f)...

Then, POKE the value $FF into the next memory location.

Do you use "gfx3"?  If so, would you like for me to add that function
to it?  I could have it return a BASIC-ized string if need be.

Chris:

Here's something I threw together.  I think this should do what you
wanted to do.. You should be able to cut this out and load it into Basic
as is.  All you may need to do is set it to the left margin, or at
least the first line.. It seems that this line has to start at left
margin.. I indented them in case Delphi wanted to do some formatting..

It may be too general for what you wanted, but this is the basic idea..
I didn't hardcode STDIN into it, but you pass the path to the procedure.

You might want to make some modifications to it.. I had it require a
33-byte string instead of a 32-byte string to allow for the $FF string
delimiter for Basic.  Also, you might want to change some of the error
handling...

  Here's a tip to use in all your replies.  Just use a ` .LT ' at
the first char., on the first line, followed by a carriage return.
This tells Delphi _not_ to format your text that follows.

  That is, Delphi will do a Literal Translation of everything that
follows after the ` .LT '.  Hope this helps...

         I tried it out, and the the value I got was a five digit number,
       something like 17220 or close to that. I got your later message on
       how to convert it, which I haven't tried yet. Still, from what I
       read in that message, it seems like I should still be getting a

       set to zero(or is it MOST significant bit? Nonetheless, it may not
       even be the call I'm using(Pd.opt), so I'm going to hold off on
       devnme until after. I'm still holding on to that message tho,
       because it is a complicated procedure compared to the call I'm
       using, and I want to come back to that when I try it.

         Considering the nature of OS-9 and it's tendency to have unix
       like redirection, I'm surprised MW made it this difficult for
       Basic09 to be able to handle the device it is dealing with. I've
       gotten to the point where yes when done right, the program KNOWS
       what device it is using, but acts completely different and is now
       returning error #55(subscript out of range) at the first line that
       test which device name(number) it is.

         Here's a snippet...

   10 RUN syscall($8D,regs)
   BASE 0

     (* This is where I get the error 55
   IF optbuffer(pd_dtp)=0 THEN (* If Std Input is from Keyboard then

     And, then, from Pipe...
   IF optbuffer(pd_dtp)=2 THEN (* If Std Input is redirected from a pipe

         Now, you noticed, I numbered them in this case, 0,1,2.
       Previously Randy told me why not to do this, unless I use a base
       of 0 I believe(which I do in this case), because base refers to
       the offset, and not the actual item number. Now I've tried
       numbering both as 1,2,3 and 0,1,2 with every combination of base 0
       and 1 and it still isn't working. Of course, it was nice of Tandy
       to point this stuff out in the manual, but I digress...

         Previously, it was working fine in the basic environment, but
       the only way I could test the redirected input was after packing
       it and using it from the command line since the command mode in
       basic09 won't let you do it. That is when I started getting the
       error 55. It came pretty close a few times, but  it was still
       munged up, I worked on it some more and now it's even worse, and I
       can't remember half of the other things that were wrong it's
       gotten so complicated. If I was writing a new killer app like a

I instructed IX to send it unformatted, but I went in and looked at
the request (within IX) to send that message and it didn't say it was
going to do so.  I didn't see anything at the first of the message as
it was input, but  I _did_ see a dot command on the last line, but
I've forgotten what it was.. It could have been .lt, I'm not sure..

I just didn't want to take any chances <G>

BTW.. did you look at the B09 code yourself?  I tried it for stdout
and also opened a file on /r0, and it came back good..

If anyone is using gfx3, I can add that function to it..  I kinda thought
I had done so, but looking at my docs, it doesn't appear so..

I'm not sure what you are doing, there....  A value?   In my suggestion
(the first, general one, you pass the address of a pre-defined text
buffer into the reg.x..

 > I got your later message on

Just enter that message into a text editor, cut out everything before
and after each of the lines "---- cut ---".  Then, you should delete
all preceding spaces.. in each line.  Save this and probably rename
it to gs_devname.b09 or whatever.  Then it should load into Basic09.

To call it, you first set up a string of at least 33 characters in the
calling program.. Then, for what you are wanting to do, just do the
call as "RUN gs_devnam(0,buffername)"  Note, Do NOT pass buffername
as ADDR, but just the string variable name..  The program will normalize
it to Basic09 format.. it will do everything, and place it in that string.

When you return to the calling program, you then can test that device
name..  It will be preceded by a leading slash.  If you are typing in
from /w7, the string will contain "/w7"+$FF.

I am assuming this is what you want.  Oh, for general purposes, if you
pass the path as a variable, it *MUST* be an integer variable, not
a byte..

How are you getting pd_dtp?  You would have to have done _gs_opt to
get this..  What's optbuffer?

 > And then further down, checks if it is from a file(rbf)
 >
 > IF redirect THEN

Is optbuffer an opt buffer gotten by _gs_opt?  If so, then you need to
have set this up by a TYPE statement..  And this would have to be
referenced as "optbuffer.pd_dtp"

If you're just trying to determine the device type, then you don't need
the devname call, just the gs_opt call  (actually, do a GetStt using
the SS.Opt number.

Again, it is possible that you could utilize "gfx3" for this.. I know this
call is in there.. However, you need to set up an Opt buffer with the
TYPE statement.  Look into your Tech Manual at the Opt buffer, or look
at your os9defs file in your SYS directory.. Set up the buffer def,
using BYTE types for 1-byte values, and INTEGER's for two-byte values.
Now you are on your way.

It _is_ in the manual, of sorts.. you just have to interpret it a
little   <G>

The reason it works differently each time is that B09 _could_ be leaving
the variables randomized with whatever value happens to be in the space
allocated for that variable, and not set to zero.. I can't remember..
It seems that between RS-Basic and Basic09, one presets all initialized
variables to zero and the other doesn't... it's been a while..  But,
from what I'm looking at, you may not be going at the problem in the
way you think you are.

If you want to, give us a capsule review of exactly what you are trying
to do.. As I said, if all you are trying to do is determine the TYPE
of device you are reading, then you don't need gs_devnm, but the
gs_opt call.. or it seems more applicable.

If you're trying to determine the type from the name, you have a lot of
variances to consider... Just for drives, you have /d0, /d1, /d2, /h0,
on... <G>  And how many serial devices do we have?.

         It seems like that is what's being returned. From where I'm at
       now(basically where I have been for the last year), it now looks
       as though, it's not a problem of figuring out what the the device
       using the path 0 is, but more or less, the program isn't correctly
       able to recieve the data in proper fashion. I ran tests which
       would print the number returned by the syscall(this is using my
       PD_DTP call) and they came back steady. So I'm finding that it
       most likely is recognising the right device and the call itself is
       working. It is how the data is handled afterwards which is the
       problem. I honestly can't figure out why, as the code looks rather
       straighforward, and if the compiterpretor is worth anything, it
       wouldn't be causing me grief with it(grin).

         By the way yes, the call I'm using is a getstat, SS.opt(as it is
       called in the book). The buffer it reads is the PD.opt section
       which is, I believe 32 or so bytes long(whatever I wrote in the
       program).

         Where I'm at now, my parameter reading section is rather clumsy
       looking, and I'm looking into another way of reading the options
       off the command line as I think problems with that area alone are
       responsible for me getting 6 different results for every 5 times I
       run it. I'm serious, this program is mega diced up now, I really
       brought the axe out on this one. Partly my fault for letting so
       much time lapse between sessions with it(which I can't help),
       therefore causing me to forget a lot of details, and also mostly
       I'm blaming Tandy and it's manuals again for dropping the ball(on
       my foot), and not educating me on these pitfalls ;-)

         After that, I have to check on the sections following each IF
       statement that determines the device. My dream is to find a way to
       use one input or get routine to use for each device, but I gather
       each one has a different way of gathering filenames.

         >>The reason it works differently each time is that B09 _could_
       be leaving the variables randomized with whatever value happens to
       be in the space...<<

         Yes, Basic09 does this, and that is probably the problem here. I
       had to insert a couple more variables to be preinit'd. I'll have
       to print it out and check for more loose cannons.

I think I already told you this, I can't remember.  But if I remember
correctly, you had attempted to create a 32-byte ARRAY.  You can't do
it this way.  What you need to do is set up a structure, using the
TYPE statement.  Look in your manual at the OPT structure.  Set up
the structure by defining each element using as much similar name
as you can.  Where the element is one byte, set it up as a BYTE, where it
is two bytes, set it up as INTEGER.  Then you DIM a variable to this
type, say DOPT.  Then, to read the device type, just read the
variable DOPT.TYP (or whatever).

Only a little, IMHO--I plan to keep using mine for some time.  The only
things that I really wish were different are

 - the decision to go with XT-flavored keyboards.  (That's one that I
   really can't figure.)
 - tying it to the VSC chip.  (I guess the thought of doing CD-i sorts
   of things, or maybe video a la Amiga, was tempting, but OTOH, it was
   getting hard to find 15.whatever KHz scan rate monitors even then,
   and I'd really like to have more text on the screen and nicer fonts
   than one can do in 8 * 8.)

(There's a minor thing or two I wish were different, notably that I
wish the boards and such would go in PClonish cases without drilling
and other finagling.  I want to switch to one of those dual 3.5/5.25"
floppies, and I'd like to go to a minitower case so one wouldn't have
to pull all the peripherals to move any of them.)

I may have to check out the 10 Mbyte hack; I ran out of RAM compiling
lout with Ultra C.  (lout does some of the kinds of things that X
windows source does (or did last time I looked at it), namely heavily
used the preprocessor to do the moral equivalent of inlining.)

Probably the main thing is that the 68340, like the 68070, has some on-chip
hardware that the 040 doesn't.  (DMA and serial I/O come to mind.)

You'd have to ask a hardware person that question.

Great to see such enthusiasm.  I dunno whether I'd worry about my MM/1
yet.  It has a few features that are really neat.

A 68040 would be neat.  My system, a System 5, has a plug-in CPU board.
As of now, the highest CPU available is a 33 MHz 68020.  I am a little
afraid, though that it will not be economically feasible for them to
design any further CPU boards.  I really don't know about the demand.

 > Are there enough programmers left or do

Heh-heh..  MW may be getting all of them <G>...

I have not seen anything -new- coming out lately.  There have been some
upgrades to software.  But you never know when something will pop up.

I must say that I certainly got some tremendously good service out

That would be the best solution.  I would certainly like to see a
single cartridge handle the whole thing.  I have an SC-2 and a
4-in-1 board for my coco, but the only drawback is that the RS-232
port does not support RTS/CTS.  I understand that he did have a few
cards that did do this, but at the time, I was getting my OSK system
and I just didn't see buying another 4-in-1.

I think it would be great to see an additional serial port on the
card, too.  I think this would really help.

Hi Dave,

  What I did was more like back in '92 and '93.  That is a long way
back to try to remember what one did to fix something, especially
when it is a one time fix.  The disappearing cursor happens
just as I exit MAIL.  I have a cursor in MAIL.  The same thing hap-
pens on the Internet.  And these blasted random characters that
just creep onto my screen at the cursor, drive me batty, especially
in a situation like now when I am replying to a message.  If I see
that I made a mistake and go to backspace, if there are any of those
random characters I have to backspace that many less spaces or my
text looks $%&#%$!y.  That last bunch of characters was meant as
an explative and were not random.  That is just about what I see
though.  Most of the time it is just a pair of dots as in .. !
They do disappear when I am finished with the message, where they
go is beyond me and why they appear is baffeling(sp).  Oh well...

  Problem is though, why would anyone go to such lengths to make
new periferals(sp) for an obsolete machine?  It is like these
people that restore very old cars like from the 30s, say.
If, they need to replace something that is no longer made commer-

the BIG $$$ to have someone do it for them.  I guess part of it
is nostalgic.  I guess we CoCo users are just going to have to

OS9/68XXX machines.  The CoCo just will not last forever, dispite
what we may feel about it!  Am I trying to convince myself to buy
one of these newer machines?  Maybe so!

Just went into Mail with monitor on and see that it sends 1B 3E 1B 5B on
exit. I think one of these is the "cursor off" command in OS-9. Actually it
means something to VT-100 terminals but OS-9 interprets it as "cursor off."

Yes.  That is the main reason that I decided to upgrade.  I still
love the CoCo immensely.  I go back to it to do a few things at times
and it's actually a good feeling.  But the reality of the fact is,
as you mentioned, that there will come a time where you can't get
parts for them and it would be impractical to make a lot of the stuff
yourself, even if you have the capability.

 > Am I trying to convince myself to buy

I must say that I am totally thrilled with my OSK system.  Sometimes
I look around and see the stuff that is available for the "mainstreams",
but when I see what I can do with this one, it begins to matter
less.

Hi Dave,
  Ya know, it is quite funny you should mention not being able to
get parts for our beloved CoCo.  I just received another "hands
on" kit for this course I am taking and with it came a few notices
that 2 of the original parts, 1 an IC, are no longer available so
they put in a suitable replacement for them with information,
schematics and pinouts so I can adapt them correctly.  Out with
the old and in with the new and improved I guess.  I have noticed
that the information being conveyed in the lessons is about 5
years out of date.  I guess it just takes time for them to get
the material updated.  Some of it has been, say, to about 2 years
ago. But, some af the lessons still state that a 40 Meg HD is the
maximum size.  Oh well...

Well, as long as one can at least substitute a part, things will be OK..
The problem for people like me, who don't really have a good grasp of
what the chips are, it will become a little more difficult..

I guess that is to be expected..  It does take time to get the books
published and the like..

Wow!  You mean a whole, full 40 Meg???

I'd consider 40 meg as a minimum for a coco, now.. When I installed a
HD on my coco - I'd guess about 5 years ago - I looked and saw that at
that time the most cost-effective size was 80 meg, and I had thoughts
of upgrading to an OSK machine or PC and thought I'd be able to move it
over, so I got it.  I usually keep around 20 meg on it...  Actually,
I think it formatted out to about 70 Meg.  All the room I'll ever
need for the coco, but hardly enough for anything else..

I have about 90 Meg tied up on my OSK machine right now (it's a 210),
but this will grow, I'm sure.  I try to keep old text files and stuff
cleaned off, but there's always a little junk lying around.. <G>

and such, mentioned in the lessons, are no longer a part of DOS.
There was one utility in particular, they had talked about, that

it is no longer with the newer DOS.  Oh well, such as it seems...

I always have had an interest in electronics but never did get started.
As with your comment,  I think I have waited too long to get started
now.

I'd say yes.  I wonder just how long it takes from the time a rough
draft for a book is submitted till it is finally published.  And in
the case of schools, after the book comes out, how long does it take
before it is adopted by the school and then till it is actually put
to use?  No doubt that current technology has made several leaps during
this time frame.

If what you're taking is a correspondence course, I'd say these schools
may not be very fast to change.. just a guess here, though.

Hi Dave,
  Yes, the course I am taking is a corresondence one.  I like this
because I can pace myself as I like, learn at my own speed rather
than that set down in a classroom.  If I do not understand something
right away I can go through and redo the lesson without the fear of
"falling behind the rest of the class".
  I feel that I must be learning something too.  I had to build an
esperiment lab for doing different circuit experiments.  Part of the
lab is a function generator that generates a square and triangular
waveform in low, medium and high frequency.  It uses a 1458 dual
op-amp.  I was having major problems with generating a waveform in
low frequency.  Medium and high worked fine.  My initial suspicion
was the 1458.  They had supplied me with a 4558, my guess it was a
pin for pin compatible IC.  I went and bought a couple of 1458s.
For about 3 days I kept checking different sections of the gener-
ator and even all my solder joints.  Nothing affected any major
change.  I was able to get it to work sometimes but when it was
used in a test circuit, it quit.  A freind of mine brought over
his O-Scope and we discovered that the signal would always go high.
I replaced the 4558 with a 1458 and it works flawlessly now.  My
first instinct was correct afterall.
  My freind has let me use his scope for an indeterminant amount
of time, so I think I my try to diagnos my ailling 6309 CoCo.  A
little "hands on" experience if you will.

Yes, a correspondence course in something like this is the way to
go.  For someone who is holding a job, classroom courses are quite
inconvenient, to say the least.

If I were going to do much electronic work, a 'scope would be one of my
first purchases.  I have the Tech Manual for the CoCo.  From what I can
determine from looking at the manual, a scope is almost indespensable
in tracking down some problems.

Hi Dave,
  I, too, have the Service manual for the CoCo 3 and I agree, it
does look as if a scope would be an indespensable tool in diagnosing
problems.  I have been experimenting with it, keeping it hooked up
to my experimental lab.  It sure is nice to see a display of what is
happening in my test circuits rather than to try to picture what is
happening just by looking at the readings of my multi-meter.
  I am really having a blast with my current experiments.  They are
dealing with logic circuits.  I still have the last circuit on the
lab and it looks like a mass of green sspaghetti.  The coomponents
consist of 2 4013 ICs.  I must have 20 or more wires hooking the
ICs together creating a 4 stage ripple counter.  I already knew what
the outcome of this experiment would be before I built the circuit.
With 4 inputs, there are 2 to the 4th power outputs or 16.  Piece of
cake.  I wanted to see how the LEDs would respond, so I built the
circuit anyway and I was right, there were 16 different LED responses.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

Hopefully you will be up to speed soon.  I'm sure NIMITZ and the

It's really bad that you weren't able to get your system going from

but maybe now, you will be able to continue.  It takes time to get
a system put together the way you want it.

The CoCo still is a match for most other systems in many respects even
now.  The biggest drawback to it now is its speed on intensive stuff,
but it does well.

My use is strictly personal, too.. well, I do keep my business records
on it, but they are quite simple.

With judicious care, you _can_ do well with a floppy.  I believe I
could have gotten by on the coco for a long time with one 360 and
two 720's.  I never tried it, but I think it would have gotten me
by. Of course, after getting used to a HD, anything seems slow..
And to think.. at one time, we thought we were flying if we had a
tape recorder <G>

 > Now I just need to figure all the differences, like how to do the

They _do_ work a little differently.  Do you have much trouble with
the difference between the parameters between the coco and OSK?
I mean where OSK precedes most parameters with "-", it gets a little
confusing at times.

I'm sure everyone will be quite happy to help.

Heh-heh.. The old stuff does bring back fond memories... <G>
I never connected a modem faster than 2400 to my coco..

BTW.. this question is addressed to anyone..  I had SACIA installed on
my coco, but every time I tried a 19.2 K-baud connect, my whole system
would crash.. I think I tried the buffer size at maximum..  Was this
normal?

 > Yep, I'm gonna pick up a second floppy drive sometime soon, and

The I/O board would be the best bet.. It has the HD interface, doesn't
it?  I just have the one 1.44 floppy on mine.  I've thought of adding
another one, can't make up my mind as to what size I'd want, whether
it would be best to use a 5 1/4 or another 3.5...  For coco transfers,
I just use the "sneaker net" method of using a 720 K 3.5 transferred
back and forth.. I could connect them via serial ports, but my setup
is kinda unhandy to get them close enough <G>

Do you have a serial printer driver where you could use one of your
serial ports?  If not, maybe someone has one you could install.

Hmmm... I just looked at my "devs".. I have a "p1" descriptor, and it
uses "sc68681" the same as my modem driver...  perhaps all you need is
a serial printer cable..  and either a serial printer or serial-parallel
converter.. I'm not sure if a CoCo converter would work.

I just looked in my manual... it doesn't list the _os9() function..   I

os9exec().. I _think_ it is a little different from the coco in its

I don't know of anything online.. perhaps someone does..  You can purchase

Hmmm, I'll try and check into the serial printer port, or might just
have to do without until the I/O board.  $200 for docs?  Geesh, you
just about buy a not to bad a hard drive for that.  They must be very
proud it would seem. :-)
  About the coco and faster than 2400 bps.  I was about to 9600 under
my own term program, which dynamicly sized reads and writes to keep
up with the flow, but would still occationally miss a few characters
at that speed.  At 4800 it would run quite nicely, with no real
problems, even futzin' around in another window.
  Well, the main thing is I can get on-line with what I do have.  Will
just be a matter of working up to better things.  Gives ya' something
to look forward to.  *smirk*
  And oh, the floppy drives.  My choice was for two 3.5" ones, as I
also had a 720K 3.5" for my Coco and the High Density ones could
still read that, and then I could use it for copying MM/1 floppies as
well.  Plus right now, why I want it, is so that I can leave the boot
disk in drive and work on other disks as well, and not have to pop it
out and pop in the boot one to load in some misc. little command I
want to use that's not already in memory, which is what I have to do
currently.  Would basicly make life easier until I get that hard
drive. :-)
  And speaking of docs and ports, I was looking over those set-up
sheets I got from IMS with my MM/1, and it does seem to show a sound
connector (P5) by the power light and video ones.  Is that port
conveniently useful, or that basicly to connect to the I/O board or

It seems that I'm correct in the price for the docs.  It is a bunch, but
I guess it might be worth it if you didn't have them..

It might not be too hard to get a serial port up and running.  Did you
check your install disks to see if there are any device descriptors by
the name of "p1" or the like?  If not, I'm sure you could edit one of
your comm drivers or if you have source for one, just edit this and
assemble under a name you like.. Mine is p1, sounds logical..

If I remember correctly, this is about my experience.  It seems that
at 9600, I would get a few misses.  At 19.2, I think I said already,
it was total crash.

I really don't know..  I don't have an MM/1 so am not familiar with
the connections.  Perhaps someone here will shed a little light on
it..

 P5 is a "sound output location. Pin 1 is sound-out, pin 2 grounded. Same
 as sound output on the CM-8 monitor."  That is from my docs.  I hooked up the

Yes, I'm very sure there are descriptors of "p1" and such, but could

I'd suspect that if you have a "p1" it might well be serial..  Of course
the descriptors might vary from system to system, but I have a "/p",
which is parallel, and also a "/p1", but it is serial.

 > I'll have to play around with it and

It isn't that hard to make a boot disk.  OS9Gen works practically like
the CoCo Os9Gen.  Only a couple of variables different.. I suppose you
know that you can type about any command and follow it with "-?" and
it will give you a brief descriptionof the commands.

however, you don't even have to make a boot disk.  If you have that
serial printer descriptor, just load it.  If you don't have a serial
printer dscr. do you have source code for /t1 or the like?  if so,
you can change the name of it and reset your initialization settings
and assemble a new one.  Or... for test purposes, just take one of
your /t? descriptors, xmode the correct values in, hook it to a serial
printer and list something >/t?  It should work...

 > Hmmmm, if really desparate enough, I could hook up my old Coco *2*

Do you have OS9 Level 1?  You might want to find one of the modified
CCDisks that will read double-sided disks and go from there..

 >  Now there's a slightly convulted process

Yeah, it is..  If you can get a printer connected to your MM/1, I think
you would be happier.

the /tX descriptors are serial ports, the /pX descriptors are parallel ports.
I put in connectors for /p and /p1 but haven't used /p1 yet.  I may be wrong
but I thought I heard (saw?) that /p1 doesn't work so well.  Of course, I never
had to run two printers at once (grin).  I have heard of people hooking up
a serial printer to one of the /tX ports but I don't have any details on that.
Heck, you might be able to pick up an old 9 pin (head), parallel  printer at
a fleamarket for cheap.  (Got one for $5 once.....it worked too!)  Or borrow
one from a PC friend.  If you have the basic system, you do have /t0 so you
could try that for a serial printer.

I guess that depends on the system.. My "/p1" (on a Delmar) is a serial
printer descriptor.. It's linked to sc68681.

 >  I have heard of people hooking

Since mine depends on sc68681, it appears all you have to do is to
"xmode" the parameters.  Probably all you might need to change is the
"lf" option, but others might need changing, too.. FWIW, here's my xmode
for my p1, if it will help:

1.win: xmode /p1
noupc nobsb bsl noecho lf null=0 nopause pag=66 bsp=08 del=18 eor=0D
eof=1B reprint=04 dup=01 psc=17 abort=03 quit=05 bse=08 bell=07
type=00 baud=9600 xon=11 xoff=13 tabc=09 tabs=4

Looks like mine has "bsb" set to "no, too.  If the printer is set up like
for a coco, providing its own linefeeds, you would have to set "lf" to no.

It should be just a matter of then getting a cable.  I don't know what it
would take for that.

I believe the machine in question was an MM/1 in which p1 IS a parallel
port.  Since it was (supposed to be) originally designed to be a step up
from the CoCo and use the same peripherals (like the CM-8 monitor), I wonder
how true that is when the basic machine has serial ports but no info on how
to hook up your serial printer to it.  I know it is easier to get parallel
printers but for any one who can just barely afford the basic system, it
would have been nice to have this information so they can use the printer
they already have.  This was the question I remember...how to hook a printer
to it.  Included was a question about serial printers.

Okay, first off, I did get my update disk!  Hurrah! :-)  Thanks for
the suggestions here and NIMITZ for MM/1 support in providing it and
all his other fine products! $Plug$ :-)  Really though, it is nice to
be more up to speed, even if it did take me a few days to get things
running right.  One of the main things was the way it boots it looks
almost like a crash, so I would always take the disk out at that point.
When I finally gave up and left the disk in there to be 'eaten', wha'la
it boots up. :-)

Now to follow up, yes, it's an MM/1 basic system, with no I/O board
yet, but am rappidly saving up for one RSN (actual milage may vary).
The printers I have are a Star NX-1000 (appears to be parallel - uses
Blue Streak Ultima to connect when had on my CoCo) and of course the
old stand-by original Tandy DMP 105, which I believe has both modes,
though the serial is that 5-pin din jack on the back.

Checking the module disk, there are both /p and /p1 desctriptors, but
they don't seem to be included in the standard system boot lists, so
assumedly don't work if only have the T0 port.

And then, basing from what you and others have suggested, I would
mainly need to find a new cable for the printer that connects to it
in serial and to the plug on the back of the MM/1 (actually in my case,
hanging out the back, as didn't really have a good way to mount them
with just some slat-like openings in the back).  So that'd probably
have to be the DMP105, unless can find a way to still use the Blue
Streak adaptor.  Also means I wouldn't be using it while modeming I
assume. :-)

Thanks again, everyone.  I'll hopefully soon be uploading here my
first program of at least minor significance I've made on my MM/1 with
C:  A spiffy little 'screen saver' sorta program.  Was a good first
project. :-)

Yes, I know.. I believe he (KNOT1, I believe) was asking what it would
take to get it to work...  I think all he needs to do is take any
serial descriptor, xmode a few variables in it, change its name, if
he wants, but doesn't even have to.  Then all he needs is a suitable cable..
and about that, I don't know about the pinouts.

What you said about info is true.  As a matter of fact, the thing -should-
have been designed with a parallel port in it to start with.  This would
have simplified matters tremendously..  I think a standard Centronics-
compatible parallel port would have satisfied the needs of 99% of all
users.  OTOH, as you said, there should have been some info on how to
hook a serial printer to the serial port, at the very least.  Everyone
needs a printer...

As a matter of fact, what's the use of providing a driver for a port
that is not even included?  That is, a port that has to be special
ordered?  Why not just include these drivers with the board?  Of course,
I realize I have drivers for devices that were not included with my
system, /d1, 1.2 meg floppies, etc, but these are things that any user
might go out and by and install themselves, so I can see the use for that,
but it does appear they would have just kept the parallel drivers, for
example, till one ordered the board. It might have kept down quite a bit
of confusion.

Jamie, a lot of us ran without the I/O board for a fair while.  I set up
my system with 2 HD floppies, plus an 80-track 5.25".  I was able to do
a lot with this system, and it was significantly more powerful and faster
than the CC3 ever was.  My first major project was to port the 'sc'
spreadsheet over from Unix, and I did most of the 'ispell' port with
this same configuration.  ("Most" because the 1 meg of system memory was
not enough to allow me to process the dictionary hash file -- so I did
that on my Unix box at work, and downloaded it.  Later, I was able to
do it directly on the MM/1 after moving to 3 meg.)

Keep at it.  And keep pursuing that I/O board, too!  I'm sure David will
help as much as he can.

Sigh.  Can't remember exactly what I did, but I suspect it involved moving
the files over to the CC3 ;-(

But I think others have mentioned the possibility of using /t1 with a
CC3-type serial-to-parallel converter.

Good luck... / Ken

Well, it certainly does push you to get new stuff for the machine.  I mean,
hey, I got the software....all I need now is the hardware.  If you didn't have
the drivers, you might not be as interested in getting the hardware.  I guess
that IMS probably figured that most people would get the extended (eventually
if not ordered at the same time).  Gee, maybe that lack of printer info in the

This is good to hear.  I think I remember seeing that the parallel port
was included with the MM/1B, but it didn't register strongly because
I had forgotten it was not available on the MM/1.

Of course, I suppose they were thinking about moving a coco printer over
to the MM/1, but I think it would have been far better to have gone with
the more standard parallel port.  I would think that most people would
have non-Radio Shack printers and these would no doubt either have a
serial-to-parallel adaptor connected to the already-available parallel
port, or a serial adaptor which I would think could be simply removed.

This has been one of my biggest hangups in my desire for a Mac.  You have
to be more picky about your printers, modems and monitors.

Yes, I do believe you have a point there.  I think it was a bad decision,
though.

It could have well been that this lack of immediate compatibility, if
you will, might have discouraged buyers.  But, again, it seemed the
purchasers were there but IMS just could not have delivered.  I
wonder how much different things might have been had shipments gotten
out in relatively orderly fashion.  It could well be that the OSK
user base would have been much larger.

I would like to have the capability for running KWindows just to have the

Yes, that would be neat.  I just wonder, though what this would do for us.
Most of the audio from CD-ROMS probably is written in Intel code, wouldn't
it?

I hear that CD writing systems are getting pretty reasonable.  Maybe someone

I have a couple "Multimedia" CDs for my messydos machine - a lot of the
sound files are in ".wav" format and are playable on the MM/1.
I plugged a couple of them into Boisy's "Linkup" comm program.  I would
think that an OS-9 "soundblaster" driver would probably play a lot of
the stuff that is available with little or no trouble.

Oh, I'd have to agree with that as well.  Those tie-ups with their
suppliers really had to cost IMS big.  I know I was on campus at the
time and had lots of friends looking to get new machines as well,
and they seemed quite interested in my descriptions of what the MM/1
could do, and at the time was quite cheap compared to comperable
systems.  So I kept waiting to show it to them, talking about it, but
when it didn't come for so long, it seemed more of a sad joke and they
fairly rightly lost interest in it, or had baught others already.

I don't blame IMS, but really would have been nice to have seen it
take off and become at least semi-popular.

  The sound drivers themselves are written in Intel code, but the sound
files themselves are not. What will be need is a program that will read the
sound files and send them to the OS9 driver. Remember that sound files like
MOD files already can be run both CLONES and OS9. Same goes for graphic files
what I would like to see for OS9 is a program that can read both the vedio
clips and sound and then play them back on the OSK system. But I wonder if
the 16MHZ systems like the MM1 and System IV would be fast enough.

Yes, it finally destroyed the faith of the public in them.  I understand
that they were victims of apparently less-than-reliable suppliers, that
they were continuously plagued by substitutions of substandard parts
by the suppliers etc.

Yes, that is right, all we'd need would be "readers".  Of course we already
have many of them, I am really not aware of all that we do have.

I doubt that these systems would be able to do the graphics fast enough for
extremely smooth operation.  They might be presentable.

I've been told that a System IV has trouble in G-Windows with 28.8 modems
using the 68681 ACIA, (but I think it might be a driver thing).  I am not
familiar with the video clips, but it is my understanding that these
are extremely graphics intensive.

Well, I've Got SuperComm up and running! It'll definatelly be more useful
for me compared to Warp1. The Capture/List works fast in Warp1 but
SuperComm is more flexible. I'm sending the capture buffer to RAM, that
way I can list the file quickly and it gets erased when I quit.

As far as Terminal colors, I made a B09 Mod to set palette to match rest
of system. For the most part, the colors stick except for two places
that I see so far. The first place is going to the main screen from
the autodial "DIAL" overlay and the other is returning from the Terminal
select overlay.

Is there any way to short circuit the palette reset at least after dialing?
If I could do that the color changes would stay changed except for
occasionally. ("R" -reset keeps changes ok)

 First I must ask, what are your custom colors? If you are just using
different screen colors chosen from the default eight "ansi" colors,
then we can fix it easily. If you are using totally non-standard

No problem. you have enough information. SuperComm forces the palettes to
"ansi" default colors. They are as you list for original. Using a disk
editor, just search on the original string ($00,$24,$12...) and change those
16 bytes to your new palette choices.

Well...here is what I have so far.

Xmodeing the W2 descriptor to eko==00, and replacing it to bootfile,
gets rid of the double characters in the overlays and stops the echoing
to the top side in conferance mode. Break key now works OK for abort.
Everything seems fine except keyboard input doesn't get echoed while in
"Shell Access". ("Tmode echo"  while there resumes keyboard echo until
you quit shell access)

The color changes themselves all work OK except I have changed the boarder
slot for W2 upon startup (display 1b 34 4 >/w2). Now, at those places that
SuperComm resets,the boarder slot gets reset the way it was before.
(a "palette </w2" gives foreground=01 background=00 boarder=04 after startup
but the boarder slot gets changed back to 00.(I've changed the W2 descriptor
in bootfile to select prn=04). I tried searching SuperComm for a string that
resembles "01 00 00" and have changed the last 00 to 04 in I think two places.
The boarder slot still gets reset back to 00, however.

These bugs aren't that important but any thoughts?

 Geeez. Okay. Soon after the point at which you mangled the palette defaults,
you'll find the byte sequence $07,$00,$00,$00,$02,$02. Change the second $00
to $04 ( 7, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2).

Didn't mean to imply any "bug" with SuperComm. I mean't something
was wrong with my system and I couldn't fix it.

> ...( 7, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2).

Interesting. At one point I tried changing the last 2 to 4. I had
figuered what I was looking for either went something like ( 0 1 1 )
or ( 0 2 2 ). I guess close dosen't count.

As far as the double character thing...as long as the W2 descriptor in
the bootfile is set for "no echo", then I don't get double characters
or a top and bottom echo in conferance. But "shell access" doesn't echo.

If you set W2 to "echo", then you can view keyboard input in "shell access"
without tmodeing but you get double characters on the overlays and
in conferance when you type on the bottom, it gets echoed on top. The BREAK
key doesn't abort the boxes either. It kills the top overlay and stays
with a work area in the shadow box only.

The double condition gets cleared up the first time you enter and leave
the "shell access" mode. Break key works too.

I'll let the W2 stay set at "no echo" so I don't see double after startup.
My shell access there will be limited. Everything else seems to be GREAT!

I now have SuperComm up and running with colors matching my system and
this is on a 3.5" disk that BOOTS from drive 2!!!. <G>

Thanks once again for all your help. I couldn't have done this without you.

However, since a schematic and technical data can be had, I'll rush the

died on me after only a day and a half in my machine.

But since I have you here, may I verify a couple of connections.  Maybe I
blew it?   There is a 6pin sip connector that plugs into the SIMM board with

There _has_ to be a way.. "MFREE" does it..  Have you looked through
the manual for all the system calls?

One cheap and dirty method, if nothing else works, would have it reference
a file, possibly in the SYS directory.  How about having it look in the
"env.file" file for MVUE?  If the user does not have MVue, just have him
create a file by that name with the oen entry...  Not neat, but
it would work..  But, as I said,  there must be a direct way..

Would it be worth the effort to disassemble MFREE?

Hello again...
  Ya know, I think you may be on to something here!  I never gave
MFREE a thought at all.  I do know that the kernal, os9p1 I think,
is the module that determines installed RAM at bootup.  I do have
a dis-assembler. Problem is, I know next to nothing about assembly.
Although, I was able to come up with a modification to INIT to have
cc3go loaded from the CMDS directory and have it unlinked when it
was done.  This is very interesting!  I shall try it and let you
know what I come up with.  Until next time...

I have never given it much thought as to how it does it..

Just looked at my Tech Manual..  Look on page 8-18 for info on F$GBlkMp

Also, if you have "Inside OS9 Level 2", or have source for SMap otherwise,
this should give you some ideas..

     SuperComm
     From: DOMM         To: RANDYKWILSON

Randy--

I wonder if you could help me on whats probably a system
bug I have here? When SuperComm is first booted, the "Change
Directory" overlay box gives double characters and the break
key just kills the top box (working area stays small. Enter
works for abort.) Also in "Z" Conferance mode, what is typed
below gets echoed above.(echo settings are off)  Sounds like a
half/full duplex thing except for the Break Key.

Everything straightens out all right though, if I goto "Shell"
and back. Something gets reset to what it should be but so far
I haven't been able to see what it is. (No apparant changes
in any Tmode or Xmode, before or after, anywhere.)

Also, I just discovered that if I list a file to /T2, when sending
to Forum it gets single spaced but if I do that to EMail it gets
double spaced. (LFs are shut off on SuperComm) Stripping the file
of LFs doesn't change anything.) Delphi??  /T2 settings??  I haven't
had the time to fully scope this out yet. Is Email text treated any
differently than Forum text.


Any thoughts?

Listing a file to /t2 opens a path to the port that is *different* than
the on SC is using. None of the changes SC did will have an affect on
this new path, except for baud and parity (they will default to unchanged,
i.e. SC's last settings). The "alf" on /t2 (which SC turns off) is what's
adding your linefeeds. The easiest way around that is to just use the
"ascii" upload option of SuperComm.

 On this other, I've never heard *that* one before. :> How about a xmode
of the window being used?

  Download the favorites.sav file, use an editor to delete the line
or lines of newsgroups you don't want, then re-upload this file as
favorites.sav and delete the old one on Delphi.

  Be careful, the `spaces' in each line are Tab's <g>.

I guess I am used to EDT, cause I used it for several years in collage
before I discovered TPU.... The one thing with EDT on delphi is, it defaults
to command mode, and you have to type "C" for "change" to go to full screen
mode... Thenm if you press F2, you will get the keypad diagram, and lots
of other good helpfull info.

 Well, with OS-9 multi-tasking and multi-windows (tm) it's easy to
just use your own editor in a second window, then move back and upload
the file.  Works for me 8-)

 It's been so long ago that I tried the online EDT that I'm real fuzzy
on it.  I had the problem of not find _how_ to exit from it 8-( and I
just killed the modem to get off line.  If my fuzzy memory is working
right, I believe that even a ctrl Z didn't work...  It's been so long

I have never gotten into the editors enough to learn all the features.  They
do have some good help features, but I feel kind of pressured when I'm
online and don't take enough time to try to learn them.

Yes, that's a good way.  I use InfoXpress and it just calls up your editor
automatically, you edit your message and then it saves it when you exit
your editor.  I like this better than taking up the time online..  Of
course it incurs logging on twice -- I usually just come back on and
upload my replies -- but it still takes less time than typing
in my stuff while online..

Heheh... I know what you mean... you get into the things, and being

It's been a few years since I looked into this, but I remember that you
ido echos to Usenet (and probably
get permission to add them as news groups).  The K12 news groups are echos

You want to put some Usenet groups onto Fido then??  I haven't seen this,
you probably have a fido board close to you and the sysop may know who
to get in touch with.  I thought you had wanted to put the Fido OS-9
echo onto Usenet, though.  There is also a fidonet news group, that's
only purpose is to distibute a Fido news letter (I think it's comp.bbs.fido
or something like that).  There may also be information about contacts
in the newsletter.

     GIME some info
     From: DBREEDING    To: ALL

Well, after making my brag a few days ago about not having any trouble
with my coco, it tried to go south on me <G>

Last night, it crashed with garbage on the screen, and turning it off
and back on, would come up with random garbage.

I took it apart and pushed on the GIME (and cpu, a 6309 socketed chip),
but I'm sure it was the GIME.  It didn't seem loose or anything but
now it seems to be OK.  It seems that this happened with my previous coco
several years ago, and it is still operable, I suppose.

What do you all do in cases like this?  Does it actually need to be
removed and cleaned somehow or should I just let it go?  Reckon it's
corrosion and stuff and if so, will this connection just get worse?

If I remember correctly, my other one did this several years ago and
no subsequent problems, so maybe just let it go?  I'm afraid to try
to remove it unless it's absolutely necessary.

  I assUme your talking about the GIME chip here.  Well, if it crashes
again in short time, then yes, pull the chip and reseat it.  Remember,
that this chip is a `J' type leg and only makes contact on one side.
I don't care much for this type, but that's me.

> Reckon it's corrosion and stuff and if so, will this connection just get

  Yep, it will, in time.  I wouldn't clean it.  Just remove and re-install
it will wipe the contact point.  Get the puller for this chip if your
not comfortable pulling it yourself.

> If I remember correctly, my other one did this several years ago and

  Just get the puller and take your time.  Also remember to ground the
computer and yourself _before_ doing any work on it.  Think of it like

Actually, I knew that.. just had to have it verified.. <G>  Probably would
be best to go ahead and do it now.  I really don't use it that much anymore,
but still would feel like something were missing if I didn't have it.

I still have my original coco, but this one has a 6309 in it.. not a real

Does Rat-Shack sell one that works?  I think I've seen them in JDR or
Jameco..

I have a spare GIME for just in case...

BTW.. my brother, who works at a pawn shop, got a coco3 for cheap..  it
won't power up.  You just get a single click, and don't hear the cassette
relay click.  I read somewhere that the clock chip can cause this..
Is the correct one hard to find?  Would this more likely be the switch
or power supply?

Be nice to have another backup..

  Yea, I think the shack still sells it.  I haven't looked lately..

  When this chip dies so will the coco.. You just can't buy New GIME's

  If you know what your doing, first check out the power supply, voltage
regs., etc.  It helps to have the Service Manual also 8-)

  If not, at least you have spare parts to test and use.

Yes, I've heard they have become hard to come by.. I can't remember where

I don't, really.. I have the Service manual, but not a lot of test
equipment.  I would like another one to stick a 6309 in.

Yes, that's for sure.. And it might come in handy.

Thanks for the info, Gene.  Myself, I have one for a spare with one working
coco and one non-working one, so maybe I'll be OK, but I'm sure there are

Aggreed, I do have one already. Also a couple of spare machines, pick them
up at yard sales etc now, but one of my spares is Dennis Skala's machine,
and the other was a $50 closeout at the shack, as is whereis. Worked just
fine, I've added "the forgotten chip" to that one too, but thats the
extent of its mods so far. Does anyone know what price this gentleman
wants for one?

         OS-9 Late Night
         Monday Night July 31 10:00 PM Eastern
         Topic:DAVID(Digital Audio/Video Interactive Decoder)
         With guest host David Kimble from Microware.

         This Monday Night, David Kimble will be here to discuss
       Microwares DAVID interactive set top system. Through the use of
       television and other forms of media, home users will be able to do
       things previously unimagined with the aid of a decoder used with
       the television known as a _set top box_. Order Pizza, play games,
       rent movies and countless other services will be available through
       this interactive medium which will add a whole new dimension to
       the television, as well as other devices(telephone,
       computers,etc...).

         DAVID is the system of software based on OS-9 which is at the
       heart of these set top boxes. With a decent amount of publicity
       devoted towards DAVID  and related interactive services in the
       media these days it only makes sense to have an OS-9 Late Night
       dedicated to this topic, and David Kimble, who works on the DAVID
       system at Microware, was kind enough to stop by anad offer some
       insight on DAVID and what impact it will probably have for us in
       the future.

  Have you been to the CoCo, Atari, Amiga Sigs in the last 24 hours ?
If the rumor is true, we won't be typing to each other after Dec 95.

  It looks like Delphi will pull the plug on there command line

I think this is only a remote (very) possibility. I think this rumor probably
came
from info in the Delphi Internet Beta Test FAQ. Most likely, some type of
user poll will take place to see how many users need/prefer a text based
service, and the the numbers will dictate that a text based service will
still be necessary. This is all speculatory, but makes sence. Afterall,
its all a $$$ thing in the long run...

  From what I've been reading in the different Sig's and in the Service
Sig, this info is in the bata release that is being tested now.

> .. user poll will take place to see how many users need/prefer a text...

  I would hope that Delphi would do it this way, but, ya never know...

  Oh, I agree on the $$$ thing.  It's just when you find out that you
have to the year's end to use this GUI or get lost...  I don't believe
that Delphi wants to support 2 interfaces.. but just might have to _if_
the rest of us yell loud enough!

  The other kick is, from the info in that bata release, that there
won't be a Mac version.  Now, if Delphi doesn't care enough to do a
Mac version, (not enough Mac people here?) what chance do the rest
of us have ? ...

  I think we better start that yelling campaign real soon ;-)

  I just got a reply from service... It comes down to, use it or lose it.
As long as a lot of people _keep_ using the command line interface, it
will stay.  So, tell SERVICE that this is what you use, and not a GUI,
so they have at least a count for the CLI.

 Even if you plan on using their new GUI thing, if you plan on continuing
with the CoCo and OS9 (and atari and amiga and commodore and ...) SIGs,
place your vote for keeping the command line interface! I feel that without

Randy:
     I modified the to line to be for all, but I agree completely.  If you
want Delphi to keep their CLI, you have to tell them.  I just finished
emailing Service, requesting that they keep the CLI, or at least survey
their users and determine the impact of dropping it before doing so.  I also
told them that if they did in fact drop their CLI, and went entirely GUI,
I would be closing out my account within a few months of their doing so.
If I wanted a snazzy GUI with no orphan computer support, I'd have an AOL
account.  I have a Delphi account solely because of their CoCo support.
The day they make access via the CoCo impossible, I no longer need my
account.  One or two messages alone won't do it though, it's going to take
all of us to get their attention.

Thanks for writing.  Delphi has not announced when the new platform will
be released.  As for the current menu driven system and InterNav, they
will be supported indefinately as long as there is significant interest by
our members.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.

This of course begs the question of what exactly constitutes "significant
interest".  I urge all concerned to write service expressing your views, and
to post in the Delphi Future forum in the Using Delphi section.

We must do two things here.  Tell SERVICE that we want to keep the CLI
and keep _using_ the CLI.

A dummy question... Do you just address an E-mail message to "Service"?
I know this is probably spelled out somewhere, but I use "ix".. you
don't "hafta" know much with it <VBG>

I must say that I would probably follow suit.  This forum is the only one
I normally visit here (except mail, of course).  IMO, I'd say that there
are many, many who are here solely because of the non-requirement for a GUI.

I suspect that if a CLI is no longer available, the coco and os-9 base
here will probably end.

You have several choices:

1)  Northern Xposure
    7 Greeboro Cres
    Ottawa, ON K1T 1W6
    Canada
    (613)736-0329
    cmckay@northx.isis.org

2)  Terry Laraway
    41 N.W. Doncee Drive
    Bremerton, WA 98310
    (206)692-5374

3)   CoNect
     449 South 90th Street
     Milwaukee, WI 53214

I'm not sure about CoNect...  I thought he _did_ sell them, but didn't
see it listed in latest ad.  However, he did have an account here,
"RICKULAND", but may not be using it now..  (Did he change it to CONECT???)
You might contact REVWCP (I think)... anyway, REVWCP is Bro. Jeremy,
and he and Rick are friends, so he should be able to tell you..

There may also be others but these are the ones I know about..

  Try contacting MRUPGRADE on delphi. He might be able to supply you with an

With regards to knowledge...this is an update on my installation of SuperComm.
I've gotten rid of most if not all the echo and hanging problems.

It seems that if I just use "SuperComm<>>>/w2&", everything works fine.
If I add any modifier (i.e. f=/r0/Capture etc.), thats when I run into those
other problems.

Since I can't add any modifier, how can I change the default buffer size?

So far so good. SuperComm sure beats what I was using for OS9. I didn't
realize how far behind the times I was...then again, I just learned how
to get a subject listing from the forum messages. <G>

Dom,

 If SuperComm <>>>/w& works, then Supercomm #40K <>>>/w& should also work.
I'm at a loss as to whats ahppening here. The #40K does not ever get to
supercomm. That is handled at the Fork by the parent shell, just like the
redirection stuff.

I'm a little fuzzy on Supercomm for the CoCo, but glancing at the docs for
Supercomm, it appears that a number by itself is accepted as a buffer
size parameter.  The #40K might not affect the buffer size, depending on how
it was written...

As I said, it's been a while since I fooled with it, but if memory serves
correctly, I also had a little difficulty with the capture open parameter,
or else I saw something about it...

Might be something that would need looking into..

Speaking of Supercomm, I think I once mentioned it already, but I believe
in ANSI (or VT100?) emulation, it had a little buglet in that it's CurXY
operated in "base 0" mode, where the Home position was 0,0 where ANSI is
"base 1", where Home is 1,1 ??? Not fatal, but a little annoying... <G>

Man, I'll  bet you're a little tired of answering SuperComm questions?
(Forum must have a million of them.) <G>
Well here goes again...only trying in the interest of knowledge to help
nail this down. If it gets too much..please ignore.

> If SuperComm <>>>/w2& works... Supercomm #40k <>>>/w2&  should...

You're right! What threw me off there was that I was trying #8k and what
showed up at the top right hand corner was 3k. I've since tried #40k etc..
and now I see that whatever value I choose gets reported as 5k less that
what is entered. (i.e. #40k shows 35k, and #8k shows 3k.) I don't know
why everything is shown as 5k less but at least it reports.

The problems appear when I give: SuperComm f=/r0/Capture <>>>/w2&.
When you go to the screen, there is a box saying "Send ASCII File". At this
point the break key only kills the top box and leaves the screen working
area only in the shadow area. You must use enter to abort from the original
overlay. Once the box is aborted, it leaves the main screen echoing the
keyboard. I think in experimenting that I've seen the screen echo even
though no overlay box was presented on startup this way.(?)
Also, whatever you type in the conference area gets echoed also on top.
You can stop the echoing by going to "Shell Access" and back but the
auto dialer box hangs with no connection tone when connection occures.

As long as I leave out the file pathlist modifier string, everything seems
to work all right. It doesn't matter to me if I'm not be able to include this
setup string. If the 5k differance in the buffer setup is normal, its a go.

One other thing I have a question about tho.. is that during an actual
conference, a couple of times I had to hit the enter key to continue
showing the conference. Once hit, the screen showed all the lines that
the others typed during that time. (checked: xmode=pau=00, tmode= -pause)
I have to figure that out if I am to use SuperComm for conference.

(Just for reference..I have made two boot disks. One for drive 0 and
one for drive 2. Both react the same. <G>)


Thanks!

     RE: SuperComm (Re: Msg 93207)

Dom,

 I'm going to, for now, call the echo thing a bug in the "f=*" parsing
routine. I've never had a complaint before, but it's very possible you
are the only one in the world who has actually *used* the feature. That
chunk of code is old, written before I "inherited" care of the program.
I did diddle with the actual download routines for 2.2, and it is possible
I broke a hook for the capture routine.

 The number you give on the command line is the total amount of data space
OS-9 will give SuperComm, minimum 8K, max 40K. Out of this data space,
SuperComm uses about 5K for it's own internal variables and data/string
buffers. Everything that is left over (3-35K) gets used as the download
buffer.

 I remember that conference problem. It is on Delphi's end. I'm not sure
if I ever figured out what tripped it, but Delphi would, under the right
conditions, turn "page pause" on for you. The fix was to either exit/
enter conference, or do a /len=0 (or was it /nopag?).

40K is a little too large a buffer.  Try a smaller one say 30K.  It works for
me.   The older versions of Supercomm would work with 40 but evidently the
newer versions are a little larger.

John,

 SuperComm, up through release 2.1a, would work fine with a 48K buffer. You
are correct that release 2.2 got a bit bigger and crossed a magic boundry.
It's max data size is 40K. release 2.3 will address this shrinking buffer
prblem in a rather unique way. Look for it this fall.

     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL

         As expected, the DAVID conference was great, and well worth the
       effort! I want to thank everyone who came and made this
       worthwhile, and I, as well as everyone else who was there,
       appreciate Dave Kimble stopping by.

         I'm not sure when the transcript will be ready for upload, as
       Colin will be handling this one. An article based on the
       transcript will be in the upcoming MOTD(not the issue that's
       coming out right now, but this next one being worked on).

         Speaking of DAVID, does anyone have the latest PIPELINES? I just
       got it in the mail today, and it looks pretty good. They had quite
       a bit of DAVID coverage in there, as well as an interesting
       article by Sherry Sitzler of KD Associates, on how Nasa uses
       Sculptor and OS-9 for several tasks related to the Space shuttle
       and budget control. KD Associates is the home of Sculptor DBMS.

         The latest MOTD should be out soon. When you get it, check out
       the TWO sourcebook articles in there, one is the promised BBS
       article w/entry form and the other is an article w/ entry form for
       industrial users. If you or someone you know belongs to these two
       categories, have those forms sent in!

         And finally, on the subject on the next OS-9 Late Night
       schedule, it still, isn't complete yet, as I have to put the
       finishing touch on a few things. We WILL be having an Atlanta fest
       related conference in September, but I forgot what exact week it
       was(DOH). I know, "Can you say, 'notepad' Chris?". Also, we will
       be having our 1 year anniversary conference this month, possibly
       another programming topic, and another conference with Mike Rowen
       VP of 6809 is in the works, but I don't know if it will be in the
       next schedule or not(we have hammered down a specific date yet, I
       don't think<G>), and we MIGHT have KD Associates, the company I
       mentioned earlier, but it hasn't been etched in stone yet. There
       won't be a shortage of topics, just a little stumbling on my part
       to either remember them or get them in the right week. Next week
       will be an Open Forum, so come one and come all, and say whatever
       the '(#T%& you want, just be nice to the host ;-)

Boisy,
 C++ support is included in "gcc2".  It examines the extension on the
 source filename to determine whether it is C or C++.  ex. sourcefile.c
 is a C file, sourcefile.cc is a C++ file - other examples in the
 docs -- extensions ".C" and ".cxx" are supposed to work to but the one
 that works for me is ".cc".  I can understand why OS-9 wouldn't spot
 the difference between "c" and "C", but the ".cpp" should have worked.

 try "gcc2 hello.cc" or "gcc2 -++lib hello.cc" if you get linker errors.

Thanks John, I figured out that indeed .cc is the correct extension.
It seems .cpp is an extension given after the source has been through
the preprocessor.

Thanks again.

Hope everyone feels that way James! Just getting to be to much work, and my
work load (real job!) has increased some, and may be more so in the future.
I plan on becoming a USAF recruiter early next year, and going to school for

va_arg takes two arguments--one is the va_list that contains some information
about how to get to the next argument, and the other is a type (so that
va_arg syntactically has to be a macro--C's, um, interesting type syntax
constrains the types that can appear there, so you may have to typedef a
type to make va_arg work).

How va_arg works depends on the particular compiler and target processor,
though often it will presume that arguments are passed on the stack, so
that a va_list contains a pointer that va_arg dereferences after appropriate
coercion and increments the pointer for the next time around.

The basic idea is that va_arg lets you step through the optional arguments
one at a time, in order (though if you have the urge, you can va_end,
va_start, and grind through them again if you want).  It's presumed that
you know what types the optional arguments have; the standard example is
printf(), in which the printf() code looks at the format string, says,
"hmmm...%d; the next argument must be an int," and uses va_arg(alist, int)
to access it.

Opinions herein are solely those of their respective authors.

I would like to echo my agreement here..  If it will be better, I'm satisfied
with the new setup.  I do look forward to getting each issue with great
anticipation, but I much prefer getting 6 issues a year over the total

Do you have the original distribution disk(s)?  If you don't have a

It shouldn't be all that hard to do.  If you have your HD driver in
6809 form - surely you do, you can first set up any bootable OS9 disk
and add the driver to your os9boot, or if you don't want to go to that
trouble, if you're using pretty much a minimal boot disk, you might be
able to just load your HD driver and descriptor into memory and get
access to your HD if you need the HD to get at critical files.

  OK - Use the ` .LT ' as the first characters of the first line.
When your done with your message, and your at the prompt to `send'
it, use the <P>ost command here.  With the .LT at the beginning,
all your text will be formatted the way _you_ typed it in.  IX will
Post it, just like you were online live.

  This is how I post my messages here.  I don't use the <U>nformatted

I think IX did this, but I'm not sure... things go by pretty fast <G>
I was trying to watch as it was posted, and did see some dot-command.

Actually, I don't have to have unformatted posting very often.  Only when
I'm posting something like this or find I need it if I start a line
out with a slash in naming a device descriptor <G>

I _will_ try to remember this..  I guess one could make a habit of starting
with this, There doesn't seem to be any harm that could happen.

About not taking chances, I meant by indenting.

Nahh, lockups don't scare me now.. I've had so many in my time that
they just come naturally, now. <G>


As a side note, in case you or anyone else is interested, I just made
a strange discovery tonight..  On my CI$ connection, it's supposed to
be a 14.4 connect, but it seemed that I got a 9600 connect about all
the time.  I figured it was just that they were too tight to buy
new modems and were still  using a lot of 9600's.  I had not really
noticed a pattern, but tonight, I went on with ix, connected at 9600,
and, in fact, was joining a new forum and wanted to get all the messages.

I had just gone online with sterm to check out my go command.  It was 14.4
I tried several connects... each time, ix was 9600, sterm was 14.4.
In my init string, I had "at s36=7".  This was listed in my manual as
the default, and I think it has been the default for everything I had
known of.  But in my factory setting, and both my nv-ram configs, it
was 135.  I took it out of my init string and ix went on at 14.4...

This sounds strange, but apparently this is something with my modem,
it doesn't want s36=7 for 14.4..  Gosh, I wish I had known that 20
minutes earlier <G>...  BTW.. FWIW, my modem is a Supra 14.4

  (hehe) I wouldn't play with those S register's.. strange & wonderfull
things _can_ happen. :)

  Unless the docs for your modem spellout just what these registers do,
I would leave them along.  On the LineLink 144e, they give you 2 commands
for the S regs., `Sr?' to read/display register `r' and `Sr=n' for setting
the register `r' Value to `n'...  Ok, but nothing about _what_ these do <G>.

  You have to hope that they're the same as Hayes settings... RIGHT!!!

Well, the docs said that 7 was supposed to be the default, but 135 was
the value stored in mine.  Actually, this was the value 7 plus bit 7
set.  However,fter downloading the docs from the Supra Forum, it explains
that bits 7-6 affect the fallback procedure or something.. I had already
determined that something like this would have to be the case.

 > Unless the docs for your modem spellout just what these registers do,

The docs that came with it explained most things fairly well.  I don't
fool with changing them very much.  A few do help.  I am amazed at
the number of people who post messages asking for init strings and the
like.  I have had very few cases where the default could not at least
conduct a successful session..  Many of them are customizations.

A few I have played with are S11, where a lower number will speed up
the dialing.  On mine, S95 affects the Connect report, and a few others
do make a difference. But, all in all, I don't do a big lot with them
except to play around with them.

 > You have to hope that they're the same as Hayes settings... RIGHT!!!

Yeah, you -hope-.  The big thing now that there are so many features
being incorporated into the modems these days that it's getting to be
that you almost need to go to school to learn all that they will do <G>

Randy,

In following with DOMM's comments. I tried  using:
SUPERCOMM -f=/r0/file <>>>/w&
on sc 2.2 a send ascii box poped up asking for a file name.
I just pressed enter and the box closed. no file was opened.
on sc 2.3 it worked perfectly. I checked /r0 and found the
file was created and waiting for me to open the buffer.
I guess he will just have to wait, to get this great

     OS-9000 & Printer
     From: JOHNREED     To: EDELMAR

Hey Ed,
 I finally managed to get my printer working with OS-9000!!

 The secret:  #$%#^#$%$%^&& IRQ conflict -- (what else?)

 It seems my sound card is set to IRQ-7 but it's IRQ can be
 changed with a software command.  Resetting it to IRQ-10 and
 then booting OS-9000 gives me a printer that works.

 Messydos and OS-2 are probably resetting that IRQ for themselves,
 and Linux seems to ignore  the sound card, but OS-9000 finds it
 on IRQ7 and does not like it.

 Now, I will reset the sound card's jumper to IRQ-10, and then
 see what THAT screws up. (Grin).

 I shoulda known it was the IRQ's , its ALWAYS the IRQ's.

 (mumble, grumble)

Well, I'll take a stab at it.  In one of my manuals it mentions that ms is the
serial mouse descriptor and if you are using it, I magine you could change it.
But I think that is the original stuff.  I don't have it on my system and I
haven't quite located what could be changed and where (got later modules).
Unforch, t1 does not have any lines for DTR, CD and RTS and this might make
using that port for a mouse an impossibility.  I have to dig into the books
to find out.  I got the extended system when I bought mine so I never looked
into using a different port for the mouse.

     Win 95
     From: DBREEDING    To: ALL

Hey, all

Has anyone seen the Win-95 Demo CD?  I saw part of it recently.. Hey,
did you know that, according to the demo, you can actually take Win-95
and start printing something and then, go back and do something else
while you are STILL PRINTING THE DOCUMENT?  YES!  Isn't that amazing?

In the demo, they say, "It isn't magic.. It's Win 95"

What will they think of next?  Have any of you heard of anything so
amazing as being able to do TWO WHOLE TASKS on your computer AT THE
SAME TIME???  Hard to believe, isn't it?    <VBG>

I also saw a review of Win 95 in the Aug US News & World Report.

About multitasking, they say,

".. You can have two or three programs, or more, open at once.

"  It will still occasionally crash - ... - but most users will find
multitasking works most of the time."
                   ^^^^
Heh heh.. I guess as long as it works -part- of the time, it's better
than not at all..  Just think about it, a concept that's been pretty
well perfected what - 15 years? and they still haven't got it right.

Maybe someday...

       someday be able to download a file from an electronic service,
       while also using another application at the same time? Perhaps
       even print a file on top of that? This is truly groundbreaking,

Heh-heee..  I remember a few years ago when DOS finally got to where
they could just load 2 programs in memory... not run them, just load
a couple..  A PC person thought they'd just landed on Mars or something.

It's amazing to watch MS-Dos grow and improve.  Each improvement

I saw a neat "press release from Microsoft" about BOB.  Did it come

Hi Dave,
  If I am not too mistaken, I think I posted such a message here right
after Bob was released.  Saw it in one of the computer publications
here in San Diego and thought people here might enjoy reading it.  I
laughed so hard I fell out of my chair.
  By the way, does anyone know the pronunciation of BOB if it is

Yeah, ain't it sad that we don't have a "superior" system like that?

I have always thought that OS9 is not for the novice, but there's a lady
here on our local BBS, who uses a PC.  Every time she tries to install
-anything- it's a month-long process.

She tried to install WinCIM last week.  I think one of her problems is
her so-called technician, but it won't even communicate with the modem.
I suspect the modem is set up for some oddball IRQ and Windows is not
set up right.  Apparently when you get your BIOS, DOS, and whatever
set up, you then have to go in and tell dummy Windoze what you've done,
too..  It's too brain-dead to figure it out itself, I suppose.

  BTW, the basic MM/1 CPU board has 3 serial ports on it. All three are
usable to 19200 baud. Only /t1 can not use hardware flow control. It only
has 2,3,& 7. You will need the I/O board to get /t3 & /t4. Those are good
to 38400 baud. the /t1 may be better suited to be used on a serial printer
since it is a basic serial port. you will need a cable and paddle board
to use it. David has both in stock. I think the set runs around $45.00

P.S. I use /t0 to run a MFJ1274 TNC , /t1 to a MFJ1278B. Work great. the

     Conference Update&Misc
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL


         I'm sorry about the somewhat long delay, but I am finally done
       making the schedule for the Augest/September Latenight. For one, I
       forgot the original date of the Atlanta conference that Newton and
       I agreed on, because I didn't write it down on one of my 5 pieces
       of scrap paper blowing around my desk<Grin> and it took me a while
       to nail down the other major dates, but everything has panned out
       and the schedule not only is ready(albeit 3 weeks late), but is a
       good one too. The full schedule will be in the next post, and Mike
       Rowen will, as usual, be posting it in his conference updates, but
       I'll give you a quick rundown here. Our big one for the end of
       September will be a conference on the Sculptor Database system
       with the President of KD Associates, Kurt Johnson. The week before
       that we will have our Atlanta prefest conference 'See You in
       Atlanta' like we did last year. Again, Newton White of the Atlanta
       Computer Society will be with us for the complete rundown.
       Sidenote, make your reservations for the fest now, if you haven't
       already.  I don't know about the other publications but an ad in
       the latest 'world of 68 micros' has all the details. Returning
       will be Mike Rowen, the UG's VP of 6809 for a continuation of the
       conference he had last month! And one more Biggie...Our 1 year
       anniversary! Augest seems to be a good month for anniversaries, as
       not only did Frank Swygert reach the 2 year goal with '268m', but
       OS-9 Late Night will be celebrating it's first year. Augest is
       definately a month to celebrate(and plan ahead to the next year!).

         Tomorrow night(Monday, Augest 14), will be an Open Forum, so
       please stop in, kick back, and teach me about OS-9!!!

         Oh yeah, another note, to Dave Breeding and those of you helping
       me out with my adventures in Basic09, I haven't forgotten you. I
       do intend to get back to you with an update. I just haven't been
       at the machine that much over the last week or two. Between work
       and the fact that it seems my  car engine is blown(it seems my
       Olds has been spending too much time with Frank Swygert's
       Rambler...), I've just been preoccupied. Hopefully I'll get a
       little time with it tonight, and maybe will have some possible
       solutions to some of this either tomorrow night or later this
       week. I just didn't want to give the impression I was asking for
       help then brushing the advice under a rug<grin>.


         And since I'm rambling...I got the latest '268m' and agree with
       James Jones. If going bimonthly will help Frank(and therefore
       improve an already great magazine), I say go for it. It's only an
       extra two weeks, which isn't much to ask. Since I have not only
       the latest issue, but _Mastering OS-9_ and _Tandy's Little Wonder_
       which I recently purchased from Farna, I have plenty of reading
       material to keep me busy! All I have to do is send my renewal
       in(rattle my cage in a couple weeks guys in case I forget<G>).
       This was a good issue, and I'm glad to hear there are a lot of
       people submitting articles. If you are writing articles for '268m'
       or any OS-9 publication for that matter, KEEP IT UP! There is no
       such thing as too many articles, and I hope to get a few in to
       '268m' myself before starting college this fall.

         Blackhawk and Whittman seem to be serious in pushing the latest
       MM/1b machine, judging from the ads in the latest issue. Has
       anyone purchased this yet? It seems like a good deal, tho at first
       I didn't consider it, because I wanted a full blown regular MM/1,
       or a System V(latter for Gwindows support), but lately it has been
looking like a good developers machine with a good price. If my car
       problems aren't so serious(ie: it's not the engine but more of a
       $200 problem, which is my preference<G>), I may consider using the
       loan money on this instead, if I can count on Kwindows being
       ported in the near future. That's a big if tho... :-/ If you own
       one of these, I'd be interested in an owner's review of it,
       similar to what David Breeding did in 268m with his System V.

Bud -

Right.  I ran into this problem too when I ported the 'sc' spreadsheet.
(Gee, looking at my files, that was FOUR years ago now!  How time flies.)
It meant I had to put "ifdef OSK" conditionals around quite a few
occurences in the port.

I haven't been bit by it for quite a while, and guess I started to pass
it off as being due to having received some pre-OS-9 V2.4 modules on my
master disks, and figured that the updates MAY have fixed this.  But
you're not running an MM/1, are you?  So this means that the problem
likely still remains in the final release, too.  Probably I have just
been avoiding using the troublesome cases.

As I remember it, most code using the "?:" ternary operator works fine;
it was only with strings, and then mostly with compound embedded
statements that I encountered the problem.

Hi, David --

Thought I would add a bit of clarification. <g>

First, the version of OSTerm you are describing is the 6809 one.
OSTerm/68K automatically strips linefeeds from the capture buffer (and
will also strip the ANSI/VT100 sequences when in the appropriate mode).

The default for either version of OSTerm would be to NOT enable automatic
linefeeds.  Turning _on_ LFs (with either version) _only_ affects what is
sent to the display, and is intended to permit compatibility with hosts that
DON'T automatically send CRLF pairs after each line.  In fact, it would be
a rare case where this configuration would be used, since most hosts
do send CRLF pairs, except when set for a special terminal emulation.
(That is, turning on the extra linefeeds should rarely be necessary.)

As an extra twist, OSTerm/68K V2.3 includes another option for VT100
compatibility:  "newline" mode allows it to be configured so that
a "CR" is inserted following each received "LF".

Fun, eh?

 > There are a couple of solutions.

Another option that I use is:

 4. Use the command "copy filename /p" to send the file to the printer.

Right.  I was, indeed, referring to the 6809 version.  I am not familiar
with the OSK version, since, AFAIK, there is no termcap version
available. <sigh>

Two great features.  The feature about stripping out the control sequences
is really neat.  A capture buffer is something that one often wishes to
review.  The linefeeds are, as we have resolved, not all that hard to
work around, albeit just a little extra work, but the control sequences
can be really messy.  STerm strips out the ESC but leaves in the subsequent
control characters.. makes for rather messy reading <G>

Well, it does make for completeness..

BTW.. I have noticed one thing with a local BBS.  I don't know how often
you will encounter this, but on screen pause, it issues a prompt,
kinda centered on the line, "Slap a key", FWIW... When you press your key,
the BBS sends extra BS's, about 20 -30.  About everything I have, both
OSK and CoCo keep backspacing up into the previous line.  Apparently most
PC programs stop the backspace at the left margin, one program had the
cursor "bumping" the left margin with the extra backspaces.  Would this
be too hard to implement?  Or is this backspacing up into the previous
line necessary for some applications?

Yep, used that one too,  forgot to mention it, <G>

skinned here, can't we.

Good to hear from you Ken.  This is some more good news on OSTerm.  The
only better thing I could hear would be the appearance of a termcap or
G-Windows version <hint><hint>

 Since your address list was posted in a forum message, it is still in the

I found it by doing a selective read, starting at 92500 (which, at current

     The New AT306
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

With the recent messages about the new AT306 (a.k.a WCP306, MM/1b), I'd
like to share some thoughts I have regarding this machine and its potential.

While realizing that the AT306 won't launch the fifth dynasty of the
personal OS-9 community, it is still an excellent introductory OS-9 machine,
and I'm excited to be a part of the development team.

The AT306 represents a chance for us, the personal OS-9 programmers, to start
over and do things right.  I think the low cost of this board will make it
a popular item.  We can take the experience and mistakes that we
learned from the MM/1 and apply them to make a better supported, more
versatile machine.

Some comparisons between the AT306 and the MM/1:

 - COST
                For around $400, you get the 68306 board.  For another
        $50, you can purchase a case and power supply for it.  Add $30
        for a cheap AT keyboard, $40 for a 3.5" 1.44MB floppy drive,
        and $70 for two 1MB SIMMs for a total of 2MB.  Using a CoCo
        as a terminal, you have an OSK machine for under $600

 - PC AT BUS
                Now I can finally buy those PC cards I've been lusting
        after for years.  Internal modems, VGA cards, sound cards,
        game cards, super duper I/O cards.  You name it, and it will
        probably work.

 - VGA, VGA and VGA
                Kiss that 15KHz monitor restriction goodbye.  Kiss that damn
        interlace goodbye.  Say hello to 4x3 aspect ratio graphics, high
        high resolution graphics, easy-to-read VGA fonts and text scrolling
        that doesn't eat the CPU.  I've seen the hardware text scrolling on
        the 306.  In one word:  F-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-S-T.

 - AT KEYBOARDS
                Recall that the MM/1 only uses XT keyboards which are getting
        harder and harder to find.  Plus, in my experience, one out of every
        two XT keyboards I've tried with the MM/1 doesn't work, narrowing the
        choices that much more.

                The AT306 uses an AT keyboard.  Hallelujah!  Again, I can go
        to (insert favorite local computer superstore here) and pick
        up the latest AT keyboard/mouse/calculator/keypad and know that
        it will work fine on the AT306.

 - NO MORE PADDLE BOARDS
                Amen and amen again!  Not only does the AT306 come with FOUR
        serial ports standard (two 68681 variants, and two high-throughput
        16550s), but all that's needed is a 10pin dual row header connector
        going to a DB-9 or DB-25 connector, mounted to the back of the PC
        chassis.

 - I CAN MOUNT IT IN A PC CASE
                This board is designed for a Baby AT case, and just "drops in."
        I don't have to break out the drill and bits, align (and mis-align),
        or fill my case with unwanted holes.

 - AFFORDABLE MASS STORAGE
                IDE may not be on the same par as SCSI, but it is cheap,
        readily available and pretty fast too.  4x IDE CD-ROM drives
        are quite a bit cheaper than SCSI ones.  Cheap tape backup
        solutions are available (Ditto, Conner, etc)

 - MEMORY
                You can go up to 64MB with the AT306, as opposed to the 11MB
        of the MM/1.

 - K-WINDOWS... NOT!
                Believe it or not, K-Windows is an interesting example on how
        not to write a windowing system.  Let's not be bitter:  I'm not knocking

        Kevin Darling, who I think is an excellent programmer, but K-Windows is
        too tied to old methods and ideas.  It's fine for the MM/1.  In my
        opinion, K-Windows MAKES the MM/1 what it is.  But the 306 has the
        potential to run more mature graphics packages like MGR, X-Windows and
        G-Windows without a hitch.  As a community, we should rally around one
        of these graphical environments.


There's only one thing the MM/1 has that the AT306 doesn't:  DMA.
I would have liked to have seen this on the AT306, but it was left out so
as to keep the price down.  Given all of the advantages listed above, I'm
not all that concerned about the lack of DMA.

My AT306 comes in on Wednesday.  Once I have it up and running, I'll post
my impressions here on the forum.

         Thanks for this post Boisy, and also for the information you
       shared on this on last Monday's OS-9 Late Night. Before learning
       more about the machine and why KWindows was dropped for this in
       favor of MGR, I had assumed it was just simply an attempt at a
       cheaper MM/1, with little expandability and future potential. From
       the details you shared, I was dead wrong. Not only does it appear
       more expandable then the MM/1, it appears to have a more overall
       sound hardware design that is at the same time, current. Also, it
       now appears MGR is actually a plus to have rather than just what I
       thought was a cheap attempt to replace Kwindows. Not only is it a
       more current windowing system(going by your post. I'm not
       experienced with either), but it should be less expensive to add
       to a system and port as it isn't a commercial product, plus there
       should already be an existing software base for this GUI. This
       already makes the machine much more marketable outside the Coco
       community. If only we get a few new apps written for the new
       platform as well as port the already existing Kwindows software
       base(which is pretty impressive itself), we may actually be able
       to carve a nitch. Here's hoping at least half the people attending
       Atlanta Fest walks out with one of these boards. Now to address
       another issue...

         >>Using a Coco as a terminal, you have an OSK machine for under
       $600.<<

         Now why would using the Coco as a terminal be necessary? Is
       there a proper video card available to allow it to run as a
       desktop system? I hope this isn't something that has to be run as
       a term based system only, ala the Kix machines without MGA. Since
       MGR is included, I assume this isn't the case and there is a board
       or card available to make it a 'real' computer :-)

         I'm looking for to your review once you get your system. I'm
       real excited about this too!

         See Ya

This is a great feature.  The only drawback in choosing a card is the
fact that you need a driver.  I wonder if the same driver would work
for the PT/Delmar systems.  If this be the case, this would enhance
the choices immensely.  The AT306 could use drivers already written
for these and there would no doubt be people in the 306 side who would
want to write drivers that don't yet exist.  But this might be wishful
thinking on my part.

Yes, and VGA monitors are easy to find.  In addition to that, if you have
to buy a new 15KHz, a 14" costs almost as much as a 15" SVGA monitor.

Of course, if you get G-Windows running, you might want a 17".  With
small fonts, you can get 4 full 80x24 screens displayed in full at the
same time.  You can do this with a 15" or 14", too, but they are just a
little bit tiny <G>

I'm hoping for G-Windows <G>.  This is what I have and I really hope to see
one common graphics interface come to the front, and of course you know
what I am hoping for.

Well, that is one thing I would liked to have had on mine.  The HD is so fast,
it presents no problem, but if you are trying to work with the floppy,
say format, or copy the whole disk, you just as well hang it up.  In
this respect, I think the original HALT CoCo gave you more chances to
get something sandwiched in <G>

But, as you say, with all the other advantages, I'm not going to cry over
mine, and I'm sure you can get around it with the 306.

Well, I'm certain all Termcap-based software will be a shoe-in, and
there's a tremendous database for this out there.  They may not be
as "fancy" as the windows-based apps, but they work.

Well, from the description, it is only a matter of writing a driver
for some video board.  I'm sure someone has written one for -some-
board.  I suspect what he meant was that you could get up and running
if you didn't want to purchase a board and monitor right away.  Going
back to what I said above, all you'd have to do to run termcap-based
software would be to setenv TERM COCO.  It would work perfectly.

I would prefer to have it as you call it a 'real' computer, but still,
if you wanted to get started on a budget, you'd have a really neat
setup with the coco term.  Where you'd see the difference would be
when you unzipped a 200K file or the like.

As I told Boisy, I am looking forward to seeing what he comes up with,
myself.  This should prove quite interesting.

As you said, this might expand our userbase significantly.

David, silly Q: Does that IDE interface do dma? The reason I ask is that
for the life of me, I can't seem to train the driver on my amiga to use
one of the 25 dma channels it has! This coco at 9600 baud is far more
dependable than the amiga which even with a buffered extra card seriel
port kit, still drops chars by the paragraph during text non-stop captures
cause it blocks all irq's and uses the cpu to move the data to the drive!
Major pain in the drain that.

     RE: The New AT306 (Re: Msg 93308)
     From: EDELMAR      To: BOISY (NR)

 Boisy,

 Some comments regarding your messages re the AT306.

 In message #93308 you state -

 > The AT306 represents a chance for us, the personal OS-9 programmers, to
 > start over and do things right.  ....

 This opportunity existed from the time the SYSTEM IV was introduced in
 Atlanta - the same time the MM/1 was shown publicly.  Prior to the intro-
 duction of the SYSTEM IV, this opportunity existed with the K1 and K2
 boards from Peripheral Technology.

 You continue outlining the advantages of the AT306 vs the MM/1.  I won't
 get into a long discourse of your points.  Suffice it to say that most of
 the advantages you outlined have been available to this community for many
 years with the IV.  Many in the community have purchased and are quite
 satisfied with their IVs.  Others have upgraded to the SYSTEM V.

 I do question one statement you made -

 >  - AFFORDABLE MASS STORAGE
 >              IDE may not be on the same par as SCSI, but it is cheap,
 >      readily available and pretty fast too.

 Neither tests we have run, tests published in several of the PC magazines
 nor tests by several of the VME hardware manufacturers substantiate such a
 statement.  If you pick and choose test results, you can prove either is
 faster.  My experience is that a greater variation exists between drive
 manufacturers and models.  The SCSI and IDE versions of a given drive will
 produce about the same results.  SCSI-2 and SCSI-FAST are intended to be
 faster and there are drive/scsi boards/driver combinations available for
 MSDOS that do come close to expectations.  However, I've yet to see or hear
 of anyone demonstrating these advantages under OS-9.  In message #93318
 you did express surprise at the performance of your IDE drive <g>.

 In message #93318 you listed some dhrystone results which I found somewhat
 baffling.

 > Dhrystone 2.1, 10000 iterations:

 > MM/1a (13.89MHz 68340)   :      4395
 > MM/1  (15Mhz 68070)      :      3229
 > AT306 (16.67Mhz 68306)   :      4239

 In Atlanta, when the SYSTEM IV was introduced, Kevin Pease asked if
 he could run his dhrystone program on the IV.  He stated the MM/1 ran at
 about 1000 for 50000 passes.  (This is Dhrystone Version 1.0 - I have a copy.)
 The SYSTEM IV (16 Mhz 68000) came in at 1666 for 50000 passes.  If we
 'normalize' and use the MM/1 results as a base, (1666/1000 = x/3229) under
 Version 2.1 the SYSTEM IV will come in at about 5380.  The difference in
 performance is primarily due to the microcode Signetics was forced to use
 when the licensing agreement with Motorola expired.  There is a small
 difference (around 6%) due to the different clock speeds.

 A couple of years later when I introduced the SYSTEM V in Chicago, Kevin had
 a 68040 machine he was showing.  He ran some dhrystone tests on his machine,
 the IV and the V.  The V was running at 25 MHz, the IV at 16 MHz and, as I
 recall, his 68040 was running at 40 MHz.  He had a different version of
 dhrystone (which I don't have).  Anyway, the results were almost directly
 proportional to the respective clock speeds.  I don't have the exact numbers
 but as I recall, the IV came in around 5000, the V around 8000 and his
 68040 was around 13000.

 Since the MM/1a and the AT306 are using Motorola chips, we should expect
 the microcode to be comparable to that used in the 68000.  With this in
 mind, I would expect differences to be mainly due to the different clock
 speeds.  Thus, I would expect results something like the following -

 MM/1  (15Mhz 68070)      :      3229 (reference)
 MM/1a (13.89MHz 68340)   :      4670 (5380 X 13.89/16)
 AT306 (16.67Mhz 68306)   :      5605 (5380 X 16.67/16)

 So it appears the version of dhrystones you are using is understating the
 performance of the AT306 and MM/1a.  (I never did think much of the dhrystone
 test.)  If you like, I can send you a copy of the dhrystones program I have
 or, if you prefer, send me a copy of the one you are using and I'll run tests
 on the IV and V.

 Two features of the AT306 I like are the 16 bit bus expansion slots
 and the use of 16550 serial chips.  I am waiting for my AT306 from Carl.
 He said it would be another 2 weeks - supposed to be the first production
 board.  Early on my agenda is a port of G-WINDOWS.  So, the AT306 will have
 at least one full fledged windowing/gfx package.  Carl also stated no
 port of K-Windows was planned but he was going to finish MGR.

 Keep reporting your experiences - I think we all find them interesting.

The one on my Sys 5 doesn't, or I assume the IDE doesn't.  The floppy
doesn't.  However, I do not lose any characters with HD capture using
a 14.4 modem and 38400 serial speed.  But read on down.

Yes, it is.  I must say that my coco with the SC II is much more pleasant
to use with the floppy than my Sys 5.  However, it seems that the HD
is fast enough to take care of things.

I did modify STerm to the effect that instead of sending XOFF on save to
disk, I changed it to drop CTS (or RTS).  I haven't tried it with floppy
capture, but maybe it will work, too.

Actually, the serial drivers should be modified to do automatic hardware
flow control.  I modified mine to do this, also.  What I did was pretty
crude, but now rarely see anything that looks like a glitch in transmission.

I never see any errors in zmodem transfers, either (knock on wood).

unforch, the drivers source isn't available, and I've not found a disasm
for it that actually works yet, at least not near as well as the ones we
have for the coco. Pity. I just fiddled with a bunch of the options, and
altho I did get a 1.2 meg/sec plus write speed, thats not going to help.
When it shuts to irq's off to write to the disk, all hell breaks loose
in the relativly unbuffered seriel ports, nobody has seen fit to make
us a board that uses the 16550 yet.

Dear friends:

Does anyone have a copy of the April 1988 Issue of Rainbow on Disk?
There was an article by Wm. Barden on the Hershey fonts that I am
interested in.  I have the issue of Rainbow, and there appears to
be an error in one line of the code.  I need to see if they fixed
the error was on the Rainbow Disk.

I don't happen to have it in front of me, but one item you might try
is to substitute any characters you think are ell's for one's and vise-versa.
I've had that bite me in Rainbow code as published more than once. It
was often printed on an old DMP printer that used the same EXACT character
for both an ell and a one. FYI I have a disk or 2 full of the Hershey Font
for the Amiga, if you are interested, I'll convert the lf's to cr's and
send it along some eveniing. Its big though! Seems I recall its on 2
of the amiga 880k 3.5" disks right now. You might even wander around
in their database here and see if you can get it direct, that version of
lha is compatible with the coco version.

     OS-9 Late Night
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL


         Here is a review and reminder. Last Monday night's Late Night,
       which was an Open Forum was great. When I got in, Boisy was
       already there talking about the new At306 computer he just
       ordered(not to himself,but others of course<G>). I learned a lot
       about this computer and found a lot of my initial reservations
       about the machine were moot and the truth it, at $400 for the
       board, this is one impressive machine, and I can't wait to get it
       in my hands myself. Check out his post here if you haven't
       already. And I hope, for those of you selling the machine who
       might be reading this, that you promote this product aggresively,
       and in many different areas. This has great potential, and if as
       Boisy said  people get behind it, could be our big break as far as
       getting new users and building on the software base that has
       already begun to grow a bit. I hope this machine eventually makes
       it into General computer shows across the country as well as OS-9
       and Coco based shows.

         Now, next Monday will be another Open Forum. I hope many of you
       show up so we can have another good conference like the last one.
       Don't forget, the conference on Augest 28th will be our 1 year
       annivesary celebration, do let's make this a biggie! Car
       dealerships are already planning the big celebration sales :-)

         On September 4th, Mike Rowen who is the OS-9 Users' Group Vice
       President of 6809 users will be back to discuss issues related the
       OS-9 Level II and activities going on within the UG. If you are
       interested in the UG, want to volunteer to work on UG activities,
       or have any comments or ideas, please be on hand for this.

93318 17-AUG 00:01 General Information
     The new AT306 -- Impressions
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

As I expected, my AT306 arrived today from Kreider Electronics.

It has gone beyond my expectations.  Awesome.  I stand amazed at the work
that has gone into the hardware and the software.  But on to more objective
notes.

My AT306 is currently in a mid-tower case.  It has 8MB of RAM currently,
a 200MB IDE Conner Hard drive, and a 1.44MB floppy.  My MM/1 is currently
acting as a terminal to the machine.  I have a VGA (Trident 8900) card
plugged in, but no VGA monitor as of yet.  Perhaps tomorrow...

After getting the board out of the packing material, I examined it closely.
It looked compact and well designed, with lots of thought to the PC case
environment.  Placing it in the mid tower case and mounting was a piece of
cake.  Four plastic mounts, two metal standoffs, two screws, and the board
was resting solidly on the side of the case.

Plugging PS8 and PS9 to the board was easy and straightforward.  Following
the thorough and excellent documentation, I had my hard drive and floppy
hooked up, and my 8MB SIMMs (2 4MBx80ns) installed in no time.  Booting
from floppy, I was able to format my IDE hard drive, install an OS-9 boot
file on it, and subsequently boot from the hard drive.

Rombug comes standard with this machine, which is a nice touch.  It's
a great tool for system development, especially for drivers.  I was able
to control whether or not Rombug would come up via a DIP switch block on
the motherboard.

Folks, this board looks just like a little PC, except there's a Motorola
processor on it.  The one AT card I put in (VGA) slid into place without
a hitch.  Great work on getting alignment to work with standard PC cases!

Benchmarks
          Once the AT306 was up and running, I was eager to do some benchmarking

to see how well it held up to my MM/1a and Joel's MM/1.  Here are some
timings:


Dhrystone 2.1, 10000 iterations:

MM/1a (13.89MHz 68340)   :      4395
MM/1  (15Mhz 68070)      :      3229
AT306 (16.67Mhz 68306)   :      4239


As you can see, the AT306 is very close to the 68340 in speed, and way over
a stock MM/1.  I was surprised to find that it ran so fast.  Very impressive
indeed.  The speed gain over the 68070 alone makes this machine a worthy
price competitor.


I also benchmarked disk speed with a program called 'timeio'.  I only
have results for the MM/1a and AT306, not the MM/1:

MM/1a (13.89MHz 68340, Quantum 240MB SCSI HD):   840K/bytes per second
AT306 (16.67MHz 68306, Conner 200MB IDE HD):    1.35MB per second


This result really surprised me.  In spite of the MM/1a having SCSI DMA,
the AT306 _without_ DMA showed a remarkable improvement in disk access.


At this point, I'm still setting up the system to my liking.  I'll report
more as it happens.

     SYQuest 555
     From: ADITNAVEL    To: ALL

Howdy all!

     I Just got hold of a Syquest 555 for a good price and I was wondering
if anyone had set up up before in their OSK machine. Currently I have an
MM/1, and I've tentatively compiled a descriptor up, but was wndering if
there i anything I specifically need to wathc out for?
    I've set the the driver kind to HRemov, and set the PD_Cntl Bit 2 (as
stated in the MM/! tech maunal). If anyone has any comment or set one of these
things up on an MM/1 before I'll appreciate any info you could give me.

                                   Thanks!

     More AT306 -- VGA
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

I couldn't wait.  Today I went out and purchased a VGA monitor for the
AT306.  15" Sony Trinitron, great picture, and OS-9 characters never
looked so good.

Currently I'm logged into through /t0 (the sc68306 serial port) and
talking to my US Robotics modem at 57600 baud with no missing characters.
Thanks to the 16550, we're cooking.

The work done on the VGA console interface is amazing.  I currently
have 8 virtual consoles open.  I wrote a simple color utility to send
out ANSI color escape sequences based on color names, and color
seems to be working great.

The NumLock/CapsLock/ScrollLock lights track the VC (virtual
console) as I flip throuh them w/ ALT/F1 to ALT/F12.  Scrolling
text is a tone faster on here than on the MM/1.

     Yes folks! The "game with no name" is in full swing! However, those bugs
can take time to kill. Testers with 070s and 030s are needed.

     You must be able to keep the game to yourself. I don't want it shown to
user groups or sent to others to test. Testers must have experiance with
debugging data/logic errors. Some testers will be given pieces of source code.

     System requirements: MM/1 with I/O board and 68070 or 68030 and HD.

     Kwin 53 or higher also required.

         Btw, depending on how the sales turn out withing the next few
       months on the AT-306 machines, especially at Atlanta Fest, you

     Hi Chris. You could still do some C debugging if you could. I know you
are fair at debugging. Have you learned C yet?            ^ I mean, if you
would.

     I must say that I wouldn't be looking forward so much to development of
this game if it weren't for Kwindows buttons. Making hot spots or detecting
your own hot spots is so hard to create the rooms and test them. This way I
can see if the buttons are there and see that their working. Easily. Does
MGR have similar buttons?

     I'm sorry, but what is an AT-306. Am I really that out of touch? :)

As JOHNBAER pointed out, it appears that it might ber hard to get
GZip to fit into a 64-K address space.

Do you need GZip for any special purpose?  For dloads from chestnut,
etc?  Perhaps if you don't need to use it a big lot, just occasional
uses, if you don't have access to an OSK machine, you might be able to
download what you need, email it to an OSK user, and have it put in
lha or ZIP format.

BTW, you don't need GZip for files in zip format, either the OS9 files
or those created by PKZip, you need "plain" zip.

Thanks, but I think this file is a bit much (size:484224)
(I don't think I can use it anyhow)
It's a cross compiler (C) I guess. I don't know anything about
it or about anything "C". Thats why I was looking at it.

If you want to check it out for yourself however:

I suppose I'll be running into it again somewhere.

Thanks.

Thanks for the advice. I tried it on this file, however, and all I
got was a 161 byte file prepared. (484224 size file normally)

Sounds handy though.

Thanks.

   For those of you who want to know how to use FTP, Gopher, etc
by Mail, look for the file `inet_by_mail.lzh' in the database.
I see it's available now.

I got it.  Haven't looked at it yet, but expect it to be quite informative.

     Conference Reminder
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL


          Augest 21, 1995     10:00 PM       Open Forum

         Tomorrow's conference will be another Open Forum, and hopefully
       it will be as good as last weeks. Last week Boisy discussed at
       length(while still only scratching the surface ;-) ), the features
       of the new OS9 based machine, the AT-306 which is now making it's
       way onto the OS-9 Market in the form of the MM/1B from Blackhawk
       and the WCP-306 from Whittman Computer Enterprises. Hopefully
       we'll be able to get a similar topic going to keep things
       interesting(Of course Boisy is always free to come back and let us
       in on what else he has learned since getting his machine...hint
       hint<Grin>

         Also, here's what's coming up in the next two weeks to come!

         Augest 28, 1995     10:00 PM       Happy Anniversary!

            Can you believe it?! OS-9 Late Night rounds it's first
          year, this month, and what a year it has been! Don't miss
          our anniversary get together, when we review the past year
          and some of the great conferences we've had, as well as what
          is planned for the upcoming year!

            Last time, we just scratched the surface. This month, Mike
          Rowen, the OS-9 Users' Group Vice President of 6809, returns
          to continue on ideas that were discussed last month. With so
          much to be done to keep the blood flowing in the OS-9
          community, you will need to become INVOLVED in any little
          way you can. This is a good opportunity to find out what YOU
          can do to help the UG, as well as a chance to enlighten us
          with your own ideas!

         See Ya
