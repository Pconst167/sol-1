  Hello Dean,
  
  From what I know, only the 68070 will support the i2c bus.. Not the
upgrade cpu which has a '020 core.  I believe that that is why 
development was discontinued.  I could be wrong on this, but this is
the way I remember it.

John A Donaldson has broken the C barrier and RiBBS.  I now have his C
conversion of Wes Gales CoCo OS9 unbundle working with arc (the Fido
archive standard).
I still need to get it working with lha and ar'd files but that should
be easy.

Dean, a good friend of mine, will be at the Underground IRC today and if 
anyone can help in his quest for i2c drivers or any info on them, please 
join in the IRC or email Dean directly at "dean.leiber@support.com" or 
"aditnavel@delphi.com".
