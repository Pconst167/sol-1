I've just ordered from them myself, so now I've got MINE I'm passing it on.
They are:-

I have to agree.  VED is one of the best editors I've used, and is by far the
best OS-9 editor out there, in my opinion.

I think that most people _are_ quite satisfied with it.  Oh, I'm sure that each
of us has our own little ideas of how it could be "improved", but the thing
about it is that it is not "finished".  Bob seems to continue to make additions
and upgrades.

I must admit that I have only scratched the surface of what it can do.  As a
matter of fact, I had the coco version originally and am now discovering
features with the OSK version that it had, too, but my reluctance to dig and
research had failed to uncover.

Sb: #Terminfo update??
Fm: David Breeding 72330,2051
To: Ken Scales 74646,2237

Ken,

I have been playing around with "SC" under G-Windows on my Delmar System 5.  It
seems that several of the display features, as well as the arrow keys are not
quite right for my system.  It _does_ seem that all is well under the "vga"
TERM screen, as far as I have tested.

I would assume that there is a discrepancy between the "vt100" file I have with
the "sc" program and my termcap file.  I tried to find the two files
("captoinfo" and "tic") here and on Delphi, but have not been able to find
them.  I assume that "captoinfo" reads a termcap file and creates a termINFO
file, and "tic" no doubt creates the binary files as supplied in the "trminfo"
files.

If possible, I would like to get hold of these utilities in order to recompile
the file(s) hoping to get my vt100 screens to working better.

David -

Your assumptions are correct... tic is 'term-info compiler'.

You should be able to do this on any SysV.4 box (or variants).

If you know anyone who runs LINUX, both tools are available there as well (a
great, FREE unix for PC's).

Should you run out of other options, I have a LINUX box here, but will be out
of town most of the week. Worst case, you could mail me the file, I'll effect
the conversions, and return mail you the result.

I would be interested in your Coco stuff. Especially the multipak, the Disto
Super controller, the sound card (the RS one??) and any software you may have.

Do you still have any of this around?

Thanks,

Dear Jost;

Thanks for your reply.  I'm up running on my MVME162LX and so far so good.   I
do have some problems in accessing off-board memory with OS-9.  The MVME162Bug
is able to access this memory but ROMBug only gives me a bus error.  Do you
have any experience with off-board memory ?

Secondly, I'm was trying to set up my serial ports to run at 38400 Baud, but
OS-9 doesn't let me do that.  Have you tried 38400 ?


Best regards,

Manfred Berger

Hello Manfred

Which memory-address are you trying to access from rombug, that gives you
bus-error ?? I don't have any problem with my MVME162LX's. It can only be
rombug(or sysinit) that sets up the MVMEchip2 master decoders wrong ?? Do you
have the programming-manuals for the MVME162LX, so you could check this. I
think the ports can only run 19200 BAUD with the clock supplied to the
85230-chip. In fact if you run the port from MVME162Bug in the eprom-socket,
then it is only safe to run 9600 BAUD, because of the eprom is only 8-bit wide
