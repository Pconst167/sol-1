>Which lazy printer is that that has visible errors in its

  Not errors in the bit map fonts, but rather a bug in one low-level
PostScript operator (imagemask) that is used for rendering certain
Type 3 PostScript fonts.  The bug is that bitmaps of certain sizes
are positioned a single pixel too high or a single pixel to the
right of where they should be.  This isn't a problem for the normal
PostScript Type 1 fonts, but does effect the ouput of `DVIPS' which
converts TeX output into PostScript by utilizing PS Type 3 fonts.

The printer is the Abaton LaserScript LX.  I bout it about three years
ago, when it was the cheapest printer I could find that had a variety
of ports (Mac AppleTalk, Parallel, and serial), and PostScript support.
Of course, now you can buy comparable printers with true Adobe Level 2
PostScript interpreters for around $700, as opposed to the $1000 I
paid for mine.  Not much of an issue, since Abaton went out of business
about a year later; it's remaining assets were sold to Everex, which
promptly killed most of the products.

     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: MRGOOD

Sorry for the long delay in getting back to you.  I've been putting
in 60-70 hour weeks finishing my book, but it's done and sent to
the printers now, so I have a bit of a respite.  (For those interested,
the initial work on ``The Working Programmer's Guide to Serial Protocols''
was all done on an MM/1 using the TeX system in the database here.
During the last weeks, I did switch to a Unix workstation that had
more memory and a much faster processor, but there's no reason the final
typography couldn't have been done on an MM/1.)

Anyway, back to your questions...

If you're a true purist, picking a good mode requires a fair bit of work.
For starters, pick any mode that has the right resolution (360 x 360 in
your case).  Once you've used it a while, pay careful attention to certain
letters, especially lowercase letters at small sizes.  Is the lowercase
`o' clearly round?  Does the lowercase `e' tend to fill in at small sizes?
Depending on the answers, you might want to adjust `blacker,' `fillin,' and
`o_correction.'  But that's something to worry about much later...

Try running `testpage.tex' through LaTeX to see if your margins and page
position are correct.  Adjust the page position win DVIPS's `config.ps' file.
If the size is off, then you may have a tougher time.  If you're using
GhostScript to print, then GhostScript is responsible for making sure the
page overall is the right size.  If the page is the right size (many
TeX and LaTeX docs use enormous margins.  There are good reasons for using
large margins, but I won't go into that here.), but the letters are too
small, then that's a problem with DVIPS and/or the mode.  If you're
using a 360x180 mode, then the letters will end up about half the height
they should.  Use a 360 by 360 mode, and tell DVIPS the resolution is
`360'.  (If you're using a printer that has different vertical and horizontal
resolutions, you need to use different options to DVIPS to tell it the
different resolutions.)  At some point, you should print out the
DVIPS manual, it makes interesting reading... <grin>

After you use it for a while, you'll notice that MetaFont gets invoked
very infrequently.  I started from scratch with my Unix box, and after just
a few weeks of heavy use, I rarely see MetaFont run.  The fonts I use
regularly have all been rendered.

Thanks for the kudos.  Now that I have some more time, I'll hopefully be
able to finally package up the source to that TeX system and post it here.
Not for the faint of heart, believe me... <grin>

I've been using this OS9 TeX system for three years, and continually refining
it.  If you get a chance in a bookstore, look at my book; I use TeX a LOT.
<grin>  Have fun, and feel free to ask questions.  I don't get on as much
as I used to, but JOHNREED is pretty knowledgable.

OK, I want to know more about you book.  What serial protocols
are covered?  Any comercial one's like Modbus? Are you covering
mostly ASCII or do you cover SDLC, HLDC, I2C, others?  How about
physical stuff like RS422, RS485, Current loop, etc? SLIP, PPP, etc?

Sorry about all the questions.  I suppose you cover all of the
multitudes of ways to calculate CRC,s , too.

     RE: VT100 Help (Re: Msg 91034)
     From: TIMKIENTZLE  To: BOISY

I don't know if I have anything electronic here.  Hmmm...  Maybe
someone could photoccopy the back pages from the V-Term manual
for you?  That will get you started.  There are a lot of ins and outs,
though.  Here's a couple for you:

* Line wrapping.  The VT100 does something quite clever at the end of a
line.  If the cursor is at the right edge, and a character arrives,
the character is printed, but the CURSOR DOES NOT MOVE.  When the
next character arrives, the cursor moves to the next line, that character
is printed, and the cursor moves to the second column.  Notice two things:
first, the cursor is never actually displayed in the first column when
this happens.  Second, there are two different situations where the cursor
is in the last column.  Internally, what many people do is move the cursor
to the `81st column' but display it in the 80th.  (The original VT100 had
a bug where the cursor would sometimes be in the 81st column when it shouldn't.)

  Oh, yeah.  The reason the VT100 does this strange line wrapping is so
that you can print a character in the lower right-hand corner without
scrolling the screen; you just have to reposition the cursor immediately
afterward.

* Be careful about border cases and large arguments.  People do sometimes
issue Cursor Up commands with argument of 100.  Make sure you do the right
thing (Play with V-Term, which I think handles those situations correctly;
Eddie and I spent a LONG time researching these details.) I can't remember
what the right thing is right now, but those details are not all obvious
(for example, I seem to recall that a backspace does NOT wrap to the
previous line).

   Hope this helps,
       Tim

That's one little gotcha I've noticed on my computer (and I think either
OSTerm or SuperComm did it too.. they wrap to the previous line.  On my
local BBS, at the end of a screenful, it issues a prompt, then apparently
about 150 _EXTRA_ BS's... it messes up what you're trying to read badly.

Double check that you have enough memory.  I've heard rumours that
OS9 doesn't always size memory correctly, so it's possible that
TeX is allocating memory that you don't have.  Initex, especially,
requires a hefty chunk of memory.  When I started working with it
on my 3 meg MM/1, I had to strip my boot a bit and be pretty careful
about what I had in memory.  I still have to sometimes reboot
because memory fragmentation won't let Initex run.

How far does it get?  Initex plain spits out quite a bit to the
console.  Does it manage to build the log file?  As someone else
mentioned, memory constraints may force you to run some things
manually instead of using the batch file.  Especially if you're
in the habit of opening a lot of shell windows on an MM/1 or
leaving `cron' or other background programs running, you may have
to edit down your Startup, maybe trim your boot, and reboot to
get it to run.  (Fortunately, `virtex' is just a tad leaner than
Initex, but it's still tight.)

the latest Damark catalog (February 15), has the more expensive

I thought all CD-i consumer units were single-speed.

At any rate, I suspect it is the original, single-speed model, as
it looks like the unit I saw in the local Software Etc. when CD-i

That it is single-speed is my hunch also, for the same reason. The newer
models are double-speed, probably why the great deal on the older ones. I
don't know for sure, but think some of the videos require double speed.

  No! The videos do not require a double speed drive. My Memorex (the orig
Tandy) works just fine. Tho if the disk is really dirty you will get an
occasional small green flash when it is unable to read the video info.

OK.. From what you said, I thought you were a little dissatisfied with
your typing.  What I meant was that it was not entirely necessary to
have had typing in High School, as apparently you have demonstrated.

If you can type in that range, you're doing as well as I am.  This is
sufficient for my usage, of course I suppose a person would always like
to do better.

  OK - the UK DELPHI is the United Kingdom Delphi section.  From
the main menu just type in `UK' and your there.  To get back to
the US side, type `US' and your sitting back at the main menu.

Yes, this is very similar to the old Boston and Kansas City regional
sections of Delphi.  As a matter of fact, they can still be accessed,
but there isn't a menu item for them (another one of those hidden-menu
items people were mentioning).  Just type 'delphi' at the main menu to
access Boston or Kansas City.  Unfortunately, they removed Miami and
Argentina which were both Spanish systems, so I no longer have the
ability to practice my quickly-diminishing Spanish vocabulary.  ;)

  Yes, I had a feeling that it had something to do with the United
Kingdom.  I went in there a second time and saw that it was indeed
Internet related.  But, when I EXIT I got logged off of Delphi.
Thanks for the info, I think I will go exploring.  I love the Inter-

  It must be in the first 40 bytes. SSPLAY displays the freq, but I have
noticed that in the _ss_play() routine, that I have to set the freq to
about 1/2 of what SSPLAY says it is.

Hi John!

  Here's the entire skinny. It's the header part of 'Waves' the IFF sound
file editor.

header  dc.b    "FORM"
size2   dc.l    0
                dc.b    "8SVXVHDR"
                dc.l    20
bytes1  dc.l    0
                dc.l    0
                dc.l    0
speed   dc.l    0
                dc.l    0
                dc.b    "ANNO"
                dc.l    44
                dc.b    "Saved with      WAVESvr1.5"
                dc.b    " 1993 by HAWKSoft "
                dc.b    "CHAN"
                dc.l    4
mono2   dc.l    2
                dc.b    "BODY"
bytes2  dc.l    0

  The sound data follows, with it's size in 'bytes2' and 'bytes1'. The 'size2'
is the size of the file including the header.

                                           Chris


PS: the 'dc's are define constants. I program mostly in assembly.

The reason why you'd set the freq to 1/2 is the sound must've been saved
as a mono file... _ss_play wants to play the sound in stereo (so it eats
up 2 bytes in the time it should only eat up one).  If you want to use
the correct frequency, you need to let _ss_play know it's a monographic
sound.  Do this by setting the 0x0001 bit in the 'flag' parameter of
_ss_play, like this:

#include <sound.h>

_ss_play(path,snddata,sndlength,freq,SND_NOSIG|0x0001,0); for no signal
_ss_play(path,snddata,sndlength,freq,SND_SENDSIG|0x0001,sigvalue); for a signal

So, it looks like the header can be variable in size to allow for
comments, etc.?  Does it appear that the speed (frequency) offset
remains constant, irregardless of the header size?

  Thanks Joel,

 I am adding sound to KTerm, so far I have the freq hard coded and it is
looking great. But I want the user to be able to change the sound files
if he want to and you can't do that very well if the freq is hardcoded.

John,

The new version of LinkUp uses a separate process to play the sound,
and it works quite well.  The sound player is based on A.J.'s sound
C sources, and plays .wav, .iff, .au and .voc files.  The files on LinkUp
are configurable, so the user can specify any sound file to play for a
particular event, as long as it's one of the 4 types above.

This player also uses events so that if multiple copes if it are running,
only one will play sound at a time.  This keeps two sounds from coming
in at the same time.

  I believe so. The only section I've seen that varies is 'ANNO' (tation).
That's why it's size is in the next four bytes. (Mine is 40 bytes)<or is it
44??>

       who are all tell it's a great piece of work. His TOOLS 3 and and

       really don't 'NEED' Cocotop(tho Tools 3 looks like something I
       could benefit from), but I'm sure I could find a way to put it to
       good use :-) I never hear much mentioned about Chris' stuff, but

         After last nights conference, I have gotten a couple additions
       to the Feb/Mar schedule(note correct spelling Ken :-) ). Next
       weeks Open Conference will be changed to to 'Termcap Part II'
       which will be the second part to Joel's discussion on the use of
       Termcaps.  The Open Forum on March 6th will be replaced by
       Northern Xposures second conference on Nitros9. Colin expect the
       latest and greatest to be out right around that time, give or take
       a little. I'm looking forward to both of these, and hope we get a
       good turnout, which I don't doubt we will, since both of them were
       biggies in the past. I will tack on the revised schedule below.

  I realesaed thius to internet,,, and didn't want y'all to feel left out.

        Comments on Comentary.   Terry Simons  UPGRADE Editor
    Within the UPGRADE readership,,, I hear more "keep up the good
work", comments or their equivilant, then anything else.  But I'd
suppose that may be expected.  Most Coco leaders within their
readership, or group will experience much of the same.  But for about
the last 4 of my 11 years with MI&CC, I've strived to be more
supportive of the "whole community".  For two reasons.  One to have a
strong group, needs diversity.  The other, as a national magazine, you
just cannot provide a full community picture, from one group, or part
of the community.  Many of the tips, and happenings, come from Delphi,
Internet, other magazines and sources.  Any one will give you a nice
view of that "spot in the woods".  I'm more interested in "looking at
the forest".
 Consequently we've been first a more then a few times:
  From the days of before many of you can remember, as a dealer
    I had #0002 - #0008 of "Worksaver Plus" (stil compat to CC3)
  First to announce the upgrade of MAX I to II
  I remember the call to our local RS Computer center, when I
    said, "I got dibbs"!  RE, "Dibbs on what"?  I sez,,, "Dibbs
    on the first Coco 3 to hit Des Moines".  To which he
    responded (grin), "OK, when are they comming out"?
  First to announce the MAX II patch for the CoCo III
    (I still have #0002 of that patch)
  First W/Rick's purchase of CoCo PRO software (even before CFDM)
  First to announce Rick's purchase of Sundog (also before CDFM)
  First to anounce the CoCo 2 Emulator, nationally
  Second only after Internet on the CoCo 3 Emulator.
    (though the first to announce it accurately)
  First to anounce UPTIMES subscribers moved to '68 Micros
     (smile) ahead of '68 micros))
  First with a variety of articles reprinted in Clipboard, and
    more recently UPTIMES, & '68 micros

   These are just what hit my foggy memory, without looking.  The
UPGRADE Magazine couldn't stay on the cuting edge, with my head in the
sand, or one group.  Yet, now and then I hear some of my ideas are
considered,,, a bit far out.  Perhaps it is others who should look
around.  Or let me ask?  Am I wrong in this:
   Not feeling the need to kiss up, to get paying advertisers, I will
anounce to our readership the unfortunate loss or poor preformance by
vendors.  (BTW: paying advertisers have been rarer then "hens teeth",
for all CoCo Mags since Rainbow)
  With no disrespect to Chris Burke; many like myself were upset by
the loss of his products, not necessarily at him.  And "prior to his
announcement" we did tell our readers sending checks, in response to
his ads placed in other magazines was usless.  Which it was.  Also
after complaints we had to warn of disapointment, if they respond to
other magazines ads for the OS Underground.   Ya see, they expect to
see some sort of regulariety, and the ad doesn't say,,, "on occassions
it gets published".   Yes, I give the truth both ways.
   I just will not join the band wagons, asking users to send money
because it's (gulp) good support for the community?   You see what I'm
trying to do here is "protect you vendors who do fill orders or answer
mail as to why or when".   Or would you prefer more users just quite
ordering from anyone, as many have already?   Yet, our magazine
devotes, ten or more times the space to a "May we recommend" column
and other good product anouncements.   That I never hear mentioned in
public SIGs.
  My OS-9 views:    It is "my opinion":
 that there are number in the OS-9 leadership that would like to
pretend that OS-9 is all there is on the CoCo.  And what's more it's
the comming wave to the future for hobby use.  And further to support
OS-9 you must both use it, and agree with their ideals.  Otherwise
you're hurting OS-9.
   I strongly disagree with that entire paragraph.  First off, I've
headed a group that has had FOUR local supporting members, graduate to
"Working for Microware".  (not to include James & Boisy, who came from
outside our area)   That's a pretty poor job of knocking it down.   I
have never used it,, yet have always felt it's a tremendeous education
tool, for those who choose.  ergo the group I head does,support OS-9.
   Granted within an OS group or area, it can seem all Coco is OS-9.
And unfortunately some goups have failed to continue support for
RSDOS.  Consquuently those "would be" members fade away.  erog,,, (in
a deep voice) "everyone I know uses OS-9".  Which is by no means the
CoCo Community.  But OS-9 is the only market?  Try telling that to
Rick Cooper.  But then he does make a serious marketing effort.
   The wave of the furture for Coco or hobby users?   Hardly.  With
OS-9 vendors dropping like flies in the late fall, I doubt any false
prop-up from me would make a differance.   OSK/ MM/1 variety?  I can
understand Dave Graham, is supporting what market there is, as best he
can.  And for the guy who wants to hack in OS-9, it's a hackers dream,
without a $6,000+ price tag.  (far less)  But to be a wave of the
future, it first has to catch the popular eye.  Without Support, I
don't see much chance of it.  My temptation is to say, "neither is AM
radio isn't comming back", but that is a poor analogy.
  Because I do agree, after talking with professional programmers,
system analists, etc,, OS-9 (OSK) truely is superior in efficiency to
the "popular" Systems of today.  It makes MSDOS, WINDOZ, etc, look
like a giant snail.  Which is no doubt why, Microware has strong
inroads to "industrial use".  I personally think the need for 8 Meg
RAM and 100 Meg HD's in the home are a joke.  Resulting from poor
computer architechture, and programming.   But if one is to learn
anything from this, it is that:  what is most efficient and what is
supported,, thus usable, are unfortunately not the same.
  If these be the opinions those in some circles get upset with, I
won't appoligize for being a realist.  It is this kind of crazy
thinking that has put and kept The UPGRADE on the cuting edge within
the CoCo Community.   Though granted,,, some disagree with <grin> the
direction of they slice.

  To accept a different view as denial of one's own, is human nature.
   Which brings to mind an older addage.   To error is human.

Frank,

Delphi has a downlevel version of Netscape for the PC and the MAC available in
the Internet database along with the Trumpet Winsock (some socket program is
necessary to run Netscape).  However, Netscape requires a SLIP/PPP connection
obtained from your local Internet provider.  At present, I know of no WWW
reader available from Delphi that works on Delphi.

You can travel on the Web from Delphi if you have an Internet account.  There
are 2 browsers available a native on running on Delphi (not very good) and
a couple lynx browsers running on various host systems that you telnet to.
These are much better and offer forms support (not as nice as Mosaic or
something running on a SLPP line but not too bad.

To use the lynx browsers from the Internet main menu type:

        gopher
        19
        2
        9 (this is the browser I use there are a couple of others)

Got a question!  If I were to start my own forum up for the CDi, does anyone
know if I put in the usenet option for the CDi newsgroup, when people use it
does it count as time toward the custom forum?  I'm not sure that made any
sense so I'll try to clear it up.  If so many minutes are spent in a forum,
the $5 a month fee is waived.  Part of the forum would be having access to
the CDi newsgroup by typing something in.  If the CDi newsgroup were to be
accessed through the forum, does anyone know if that time would count as
time going toward the forum usage?
 (I hope I'm making some sort of sense here!).

I believe that doing

instead of

    gs file

will get you what you want.  (Of course, add whatever other options you

Do I understand correctly? You want to use a DMP105 with MSDOS? Or RSDOS?
{at it is in graphics mode. You may have to develope a driver for MSDOS on your
own, but any Tandy machine will support Tandy Graphics. Good luck!

Thanks for the reply. Yes it's for MSDOS Windows. Graphics or not Windows

Well, my drive has only five jumper positions.  Turns out the first two toward
the SCSI connector have to be connected or the drive doesn't spin.  The others
are for the ID.  Turns out the jumper was not making contact even though it was
on the pins.  A little "modifying" got it to work OK.  Unforch, the pins are
smaller than what the more common jumpers will handle so I had a little work
(little in both senses of the word) to do rather than hop down to the local
electronics store and buy some jumpers.  I did get it to work and it is
holding up so far.  Thanks for the help.  I'm saving your info for future

   This tells me that you uploaded these files to your workspace
in Binary format and not as ASCII.  You _have_ to use ASCII to your
Workspace for this to work.  Delphi encodes _all_ 8 bit binary files
that you upload to your workspace.. to save space.

   The `problem' is, that when you send one of these `Delphi encoded'
files out of the Delphi system, they are Still encoded. :(

   Soooo, the short story is, ASCII upload to your workspace, then `put'
that out to the `net.  Delphi does know about the problem and is working
on a `fix... someday soon I'm hope'n.  :)

   If you want the whole story, go to the Internet Sig database, there's
a few Faq's files that are real good reading.

  I would also like to know if someone here can contact Colin McKay
and find out if he is in fact the "Colin McKay" I saw in the"Honor-
ary Crew Members" list.  And, if so, how did he get his name on their
list.
Also, to any of you in the Southern California area, there is a Star
Trek convention in San Diego on March 4, Saturday from 11:00AM to
6:00PM.  I will be there, in uniform, as a Vulcan CMDR named Siran.
  Any info to my quest will be greatly appreciated.  See ya among the
stars!

     BStart.a
     From: VAXELF       To: ALL

  I found a module on the MM/1 disks called "cstart.a" . After looking
at this I have determined that this must be the assemble code for CSTART.R
that all C programs use.
  I am attempting to come up with a way to make Basic Subroutine Modules
by writing them in C. I changed the psect in the cstart.a to be a
subroutine and then renamed the module BSTART.A
  When I try and compile this with a simple Hello C program, I get the
following error from the linker.

error - Initialized data (or jumptable) allowed only on program or
        trap handler modules.

Is what I am attempting to do possible???
