I also am having problems, not only with the VME162 boards, but with
a 4 way RS232 IP board made by TEWS. I can communicate quite happily if I dont
try to access the RTS line. Once I start doing this, and there is
activity on the other line my software eventually hangs up. I'm at this
moment trying to solve this, and will let you know if I have any success!!!

Dear friends:

I am looking to buy a DISTO 512K Ram Pak.  This was a 512k ram disk that
plugged into a multipak.  I will buy either in working or reasonably fixable
condition.  I would also need any associated software.

Hi all.  I finally was able to resign up with Compuserve.  Now that I can
access it via the internet there is no usuage charges!

Does anyone know how to get InfoXpress to work when connected via telnet (from
my internet shell account)?  The only options I see for connecting is direct
dial via the CI$ network or Tymnet/Sprintnet.  We do not have local CI$ or
Sprintnet and our locl Tymnet adds a $2 surcharge for CI$ so I refuse to use
it, why pay for an unlimited shell inet account and CI$ too.

Hmmm...  An aspect I had not considered - myself not yet having such access :-(
Sounds like another assignment for Bill <G>

You might be able to fake some of the fields in default.ini whereby you could
transfer control over to IX from an already-established connection.  However,
apparently IX looks for responses from the modem, so it might take a little
work, but it might be possible.

Jim, you may be in for a heck of a surprise.

There may not be any SURCHARGES, but the USAGE charges are still in effect,
even if telnet'ing in.

Of course, as long as you keep the usage under 3 (5?) hours per month, then,
yeah, in effect there is no additional charge beyond the monthly membership
fee.

Actually we get 5 free hours for $9.95 per month, not too bad.

I meant no connect charges, not usuage charges.

On my trial account, my first month is free with 10 FREE hours AND on top of
that I got $35 usuage credits for additional hours.  In all, not too bad.

Hi Jim, welcome back! Yes, its possible to use a unix shell account with
InfoXpress.  I use it during the day with Delphi, to avoid network
charges.  I can't guarantee that it will work, though, it depends on a
couple of things working out just right.  What version of InfoXpress do
you have? Also, I'm pretty sure that B protocol upload/download won't
work either since I had to use the SevenBit option to get it to work.
You need to set up a special network option block, this is the one I
use:

[CIS Internet]                                  ;Network options for CIS internet connection
 NetworkType    = alternate             ;Network type
 Modem                  = Modem /T0             ;Modem option block name (not path name!)
 BaudRate               = 9600                  ;Baud rate
 PhoneNumber    = 555-1234              ;Phone number
 SevenBit
 Macro=cis_internet_macro

Refer to this network option block from the CIS system option block,
rather than the standard one (I keep them both in the ini file with one
or the other commented out).  The macro (with a file name of
'cis_internet_macro' just like the option value) looks something like
this:

WAIT login:
SEND userid^M
WAIT word:
SEND password^M
WAIT %
SEND telnet^M
WAIT telnet>
SEND toggle localflow^M
WAIT telnet>
SEND open compuserve.com^M
WAIT Host name:
SEND CISAGREE^M
WAIT OFF):
SEND 9600^M
WAIT User ID:
EXIT

As you can see, these 'macros' are a very simple script languange.
InfoXpress expects to be left at the CIS UserID: prompt, or this won't
work. I can't promise that it will work for you, but I'll do what I can
to help you get it going.

You mean we could do this all along?  I didn't check the manual, but is all
this in there?

Alright..  maybe what you are gonna have to do is rewrite IX altogether.

You need to incorporate a quiz in the program asking questions from the manual.
Until we can answer 90% of the questions, the program will be inoperative
<G>...  And I'm about the worst manual non-reader of the whole group, I'll
bet..

Well, of course I guess we all have our own little "wish lists" for features,
but I, for one, am really thankful we have it in its current version.  It is
quite reliable, and I am totally dependent upon it for all my mail and

Hello George,

Several articles on old CoCo magazines explained such a setup with a VGA
monitor on a CoCo. It seems today's VGA standard (and since it was implemented)
works on RGB analog video information - contrary to that RGB TTL video from CGA
and EGA, so to use a VGA monitor with a CoCo 3 (which feeds out RGB analog
video) you just need to match up the signal lines between the two connectors.
The "catch" on using VGA is that the VGA monitor MUST be able to synch at 15
+/- MHz (don't recall the exact number) as this is the frequency used by the
CoCo's RGB. Many multi-synch monitors are able to step down this far,  still, I
haven't seen such on the newest PC hardware catalogs; there must be some
available new from certain manufacturers.

Perhaps you can get lucky with such a VGA monitor in stores that sell used PC
stuff. This is one of those things I have kept an eye open for,  so when I come
across a Multi-Synch monitor capable of beign used with my CoCo 3 I WILL BUY IT
ON THE SPOT!. The quality of the image must be something to see and enjoy.

IF you have some questions about the pinouts on both the VGA and CoCo's RGB
connectors feel free to post again here. Right this minute I do not have my
tech manuals handy and need time to browse the books before posting something
here... ;-)

I'm not sure if it is a case of my terminfo file not being compatible with my
system or not, but it would seem so.. The TERM (vga) screen appears to do well,
but my G-Windows screen has a bit of trouble with the codes..

There is no OSK version of "tic"?

OOps, checked my list again.  There are TWO files in DL-12 called "curses.ar".
One with length 20841 by 76625,2440 is probably the one you have

The other, with length 264742 by 73270,3124 is the one I got the captoinfo and

Hello Manfred,

regarding the off-board memory Ole Hansen already gave you some good hints. The
VMEchip needs some registers initialized, before you can access the VMEbus
safely. The OS-9 debugger does that automatically for you, but apparently not
the Mototrola Rombug.

For the serial ports, I also tried to use higher baud rates. I found out, that
with OS-9 version 2.4 the device driver is not able to use a higher baud rate
than 19200, although the chips are specified to go up to a speed of 38.4kbaud.
I think with OS-9 3.0 this is fixed, but I'm not sure, I never tried it. Ole is
right, that it doesn't make much sense to use more than 9600 baud on the
console (/term) port, because the debugger uses that baudrate as default, and
it's not easy to change that. But it makes some sense to use a higher baud rate
on serial port 2 (/t1), especially if you use it to download files.

Regards,

Jost

Hello Jost;

I have tried tmode and I wrote my own program to set the baud rate to 38400 but
OS-9 3.0 doesn't allow me to do so.   Since I am cross developing it would
really nice to speed up the download time and I'm also planning to do real-time
data acquisition and transfer the data over the RS-232 port.  Since I only have
the BSP product I don't have source code for the serial driver so I can't
change it and I really don't want to write my own driver.

Manfred,

>>I have tried tmode and I wrote my own program to set the baud rate to 38400
but OS-9 3.0 doesn't allow me to do so.   Since I am cross developing it would
really nice to speed up the download time and I'm also planning to do real-time
data acquisition and transfer the data over the RS-232 port.  Since I only have
the BSP product I don't have source code for the serial driver so I can't
change it and I really don't want to write my own driver.<<

Weel, I guess you have to accept what MW did, if you don't want to write your
own driver. Have you considered using Ethernet (TCP/IP) for transfering the
data? Another option is to purchase a third party serial board for higher baud
rates, incl OS-9 driver, and use that. But make sure you get a driver for OS-9
3.0, the ones for earlier version might not work...

I know of an english company who have such boards and drivers. If you like, I
can give you their address, I don't have it right now, but I can find it
somewhere.

Dear friends:

I am looking to buy a DISTO 512K Ram Pak.  This was a 512k ram disk that
plugged into a multipak.  I will buy either in working or reasonably fixable
condition.  I would also need any associated software.


With all best wishes,

Sb: #OS9 3.0 crashes if ...
Fm: Rainer Thieringer 100544,1230
To: All

Hello,

the last few weeks I've had serious trouble with OS9/68000. I hope this message
will prevent anyone out there from spending lonely nights face to face with a
crashed system.

Scenario 1: A board in my system produces asynchronous interrupts.
Unfortunately the interrupt level switched to the VME bus had intermediate
states (e.g. IRQ 6 was for a few us an IRQ 2). This should be reported as
SPURIOUS IRQ followed by a system reset if not handled by a user trap (or 3.0's
SpurIRQ flag). What I've had was a total CRASH !!! Not even ROMBUG could help.
I (and my hardware vendor) suppose that this SPURIOUS IRQ message will not
appear, if immediately after the first (bad) IRQ another (good) IRQ happens.
This crashes OS-9 completely.

Workaround: a) I set the SpurIRQ-flag in the init modules COMPAT Byte to ignore
Spurious IRQs. b) I jumpered the board with IRQ 2 so that no intermediate IRQ
states could happen.


Scenario 2: Together with that SpurIRQ flag I set the PrivAlm flag which should
keep OS-9 from accidentialy deleting foreign alarms. After I did so I've had
system crashes (w/o any notification) every couple of minutes. After resetting
the flag everything worked fine again. As I've heard on the SYSTEMS this is an
know bug. Microware offers an update.

BUT ONCE AGAIN MICROWARE DID NOT INFORM US DEVELOPERS ABOUT A KNOWN BUG!


I hope this was the last serious surprise with 3.0x (knock on wood).

 This isn't really down to OS-9, is it?. If a 680x0 processor gets an exception
during an exception-handling routine, it resets. It looks as if your problem
was poor hardware rather than poor OS.

 >>I set the PrivAlm flag which should keep OS-9 from accidentialy deleting

 The PrivAlm seems to be something of a workaround for slightly flaky alarms.
Doesn't it only work to protect other UserID's (no use for tasks with a common
parent)? You can use semaphores to guard against accidental deletes, which
avoids the M'ware bug.

 >>BUT ONCE AGAIN MICROWARE DID NOT INFORM US DEVELOPERS ABOUT A KNOWN BUG!<<

 Microware have NEVER been good at advertising their faults.

 Now that would be surprising!!

Fact is, that I haven't ever had problems with OS9 2.4. That doesn't mean that
I haven't ever got spurious IRQs! Boy, I really got a hell lot of them, but OS9
2.4 told me that it has caught one before the system resets. So probably you
are right, but if so I hope that my report gives someone having these
mysterious crashes a hint.

 You're right, that's what the manual says. I was basing my comments on
information from Microware Technical Support in the UK. To quote . . .

 "On Ver3.0 OS-9 this may be partially prevented by setting a field in the init
module, which causes a check such that when an alarm is deleted, it must be in
the same user/group."

 I queried the statement at the time, and was told (verbally) that sibling
processes sharing the same user/group ID could still accidentally delete each
others alarms. Since this didn't solve my problem, I used a workaround rather
than M$Compat.

 Not a complete answer, I know, but the best I can do for now. Hope it helps.

I am writing an OS-9 application to a device that uses RTS/CTS flow control.  I
need to enable my SCF device to handle this flow control but do not know how.
I have looked at changing the device descriptor but nothing seems obvious
there.  I see that the SCF device has a static structure that signals when to
enable the RTS/CTS but don't know how to access it?

Anybody with any advice?

Thanks for the help!!

The ability of your system to work with CTS/RTS flow control depends on two
things - the ability of your actual serial communications device to handle flow
control, and the device driver itself having the ability to configure the
device to do so.

It is safe to assume that your serial device has the ability to handle flow
control, but the device driver is another question. The device driver will
have, most likely, been supplied to you by the company you have bought your
hardware from, and so I would recommend that you speak to them to get an
accurate answer.

I will give you an example of my SCF device driver experiences. In the SCF
device drivers that I have, CTS / RTS flow control is enabled by using the
xmode utility to set the XON and XOFF properties to certain values not normally
used for XON and XOFF e.g. both to 0. The device driver, when it picks this up,
puts the device into CTS / RTS flow control mode.
Unfortunately, however, the manufacturers definition of flow control was not
the same as mine - they asserted RTS permanently (whether or not data was ready
to be transmitted) and waited for CTS to be asserted before transmitting data,
whereas I required to assert RTS only when I had data available to send, and
wait for CTS to be asserted before sending it, then de-assert RTS after the
data was sent. In order to achieve this I had to modify the device driver
itself, which required fairly in-depth knowledge about the device.

Obviously, if you dont have this knowledge, and need to do a similar
modification, it is better to get the manufacturer / device driver supplier to
do it for you.

I hope this puts things into perspective.

Cheers,

Marc.

Thanks for the info Marc.

My situation is that I'm running on a MVME167 box wwith a 68681 UART device.

However, the eventual target is a custom box again using a 68681 UART.  I have
source code for the driver and it has a flag stored in the SCF static data
field that allows me to activate the hardware flow control.  It seems I need to
get to this flag before driver initialization.

I guess my best bet is as you recommended and talk to the driver's author.

Thanks again,

Doug,

there is an OS-9 system call that you could use to enable RTS/CTS flow control.

The name of the call is I$SetStt. Among others, there are function codes
available to disable and enable the RTS hardware handshake lines. From C, you
can use that call by calling _os_ss_dsrts(path) to disable or
_os_ss_enrts(path) to enable RTS (see your C-library manual). Of course, this
requires that your driver as well as your hardware support RTS. You could
simply try it, or consult your hardware manufacturer, in case your manuals
don't tell you enough about RTS and CTS (mine don't, I'm using an ELTEC board
right now). They should be able to help you.

Regards,

Jost
