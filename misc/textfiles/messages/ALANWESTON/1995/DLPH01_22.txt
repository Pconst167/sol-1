The SCSI scanners are 100-400 DPI, 4.134" width. Did I say one was color???
One is 256 gray scale, the other is simple B&W. B&W is $49.95, Gray scale
is $79.95. Both use a standard SCSI interface. That's all the details listed.
You can call Halted Specialties Co. at 408-732-1573 for details. You also need
to ask about shipping rates via UPS. They send COD is no shipping sent.

     Ok, sounds great. Can I pick up GR2 at the fest from a vendor?

     I just designed around 20 or so icons for EthaGUI and I'll be uploading

To tell the truth, I haven't gotten to use my joystick for awhile now due
to other problems. Also, I'm going to use a serial mouse as soon as I
address my other problems(monitor and HD). I have a converted rs232pak
and serial mouse so I'll see how that works out. But thanx for your info,
you obviously experienced the same problem. For awhile there I thought
it was just something I was doing wrong. Again thanx, Charlie

  You are really going to enjoy the serial mouse.  I converted on of
my deluxe rs232 pack to a dual rs232 and have been using it for about a

I had Tony D. modify one of his rs232 paks for me. The problem now is getting
a 9pin to 16pin converter. The 9pin being the MS mouse and the 16pin is
Disto's Rs232pak. I don't guess it will be too hard. I'm looking forward
to a decent mouse, something I haven't experienced yet. Regards, Charlie

Not only that, but it eats WAY less CPU time than the high-res interface.
The high-res interface is to the mouse what the bit-banger port is to
serial I/O--a way to make a cheap part at the cost of using large numbers
of CPU cycles.

  Before I built my dual rs232 I was considering the 10bit a/d converter

speaking of CPU load, I just got my Eliminator and soon I will have a

You _can_ get the pixel info by GETting a block into a buffer and then
reading the data within the buffer, because you know the address of it.

Of course you'll have to take into consideration the which screen type
it is, and adjust your pixel depth accordingly.

If speed is imperative, this might not be a workable solution.

Thanks for the info. Seems to me that "GETting" the first verticle Y data
column into a buffer where it could be viewed and manipulated for program
use would be good because I must first scan from top to bottom (first
column) a, reversing every other line, etc...
Now I guess I'll just have to find out how to do that with the chosen
buffer. (READ? PEEK? etc...)

I'd say this would be the way to do it.. again, it might not yield the
speed you need, not really sure of how fast this can operate.

Possibly PEEK.. or it might be good (and faster) to possibly write a
subroutine module in assembly.  As a matter of fact, I think I have the
source code for a graphics screen dump to a printer that I once tinkered
around with.  Do you have the old "asm" assembler from Level 1?  You might
look this over and get some ideas as to how to do this.

If I remember correctly, there seemed to be a bug where you couldn't get
but the screen width -1 pixel into a buffer.  I.E.  seems like if you had
a 640-wide screen, all you could get was 639 pixels wide.. can't remember.

I may have misunderstood what you were saying.. forgive me if I'm getting
too basic for you, but it occurred to me that you might possibly have been
posing the question as to how to get the data into a buffer.

If this is the case, you need to study the section "Windows" in your big
manual.  You send escape codes, to manipulate buffers.  Look under
DfnGPBuf, GetBlk, KilBuf, PutBlk (possibly).  You'll first need to
Define a buffer, then "GetBlk" the specified area..  Then you can look at
the various pixels.. remember that one bit defines a 2-color pixel, it
takes 2 bits for a 4-color pixel, and 4 bits for a 16-color pixel.  Really,
this represents the Palette #, and you will probably need to first issue
calls to read the colors stored in these Palette registers, depending on
exactly what you are doing.

I may have gotten too elementary for you, but on further looking at your
post, thought this might be what you are asking.  Actually you need to
read this post before you read my previous one <G>..

Depends on the application.  If there's some locality of reference,
you should be able to amortize a GET over several pixel examinations.

I know very little at this point about how to do this.
"GETting" a block I understand---how to and where to examine this block
I have yet to learn.
Assembly language is something I have no knowledge of or access to.

I assume you want to do this strictly from BASIC09 then?  Well.. You
probably should get either the revised "gfx2" by Kevin Darling, or you
need to get "gfx3.ar".  This is a thing I wrote a long time back.  It
contains many of the functions you will need for this project (if the
revised "gfx2" doesn't, I never got into it).  Probably you should get
the gfx3 thing.. I'm not sure if it's still available here or not.  If
not maybe I can mail it to you.. Do you have ar to unarchive it?

As far as I know I have all the GFX2 updates- as well as GFX3 and GFX5.

I guess strictly Basic09?

Ideally if I had a choice the program would take any x-y screen point
as a parameter and give out the pixel color or at least pallette slot.
I would call this program from within another Basic09 program that
scans the screen in the appropriate fashion subject to change.

Now --in the real world???

I would settle for a simple top to bottom-bottom to top (alternaning)-
screen scan that gives pixel info.

  HeHe  Right Larry, CirCad  THINKS it's drawing a line
every 5 pixels down the screen.

  If you would like a little more frustration, turn off the
"SNAP" feature and try to draw lines at every pixel in the
`fat' space -- use the `sline' with the CTRL-SHFT arrows keys
for pixel-by-pixel movement.  You will find that one of
those pixels is not really there -- or at least, you can't
draw there.  (The dead `space' is right next to the grid line).
(SOMETIMES) (?!!!?).

  The spacing is right -- the PostScript drawing produced from
the same x-y data is right on the nose.  The Kwindows display has
"holes" in it.

  More fun  - if I feed the PostScript output from
CirCad through Ghostscript and output it to a GIF file,
some of the horizontal  lines vanish if displayed
on an MM/1 with gifshow (but they are there -- the GIF
reader on my messydos machine shows them.)


 If you come across a cure for this little quirk, let me
know.

John, I'm not totally clear on this msg, but from the other replies
already posted, I take it you are looking at a GIF file. I've also noted
that effect, and it is usually caused by the files format being bigger than
a coco screen so the scaling kicks in throwing out stuff until it fits.
The cure is to use ViewGifs scaling controls to scale it back up to 1-1
and also adjust the position of the resultant less than full image "window"
into it you are seeing until the detail in the area of interest becomes
visible. Some of those GIF images I've dlded here were actually 1680x1680
images!  A LOT gets tossed if you try to look at the whole image on a
coco screen when its that big.

A secondary problem will atack you when drawing graphics in that it may
not draw where you want it to if you think you specified the exact pixel.
If the window is bordered or some such, reducing the actual working area
from the 0-639x0-191 real area, and the scaling switch in gfx2 is on so
you can use full range (0-639 and 0-191) sized commands, they will be
scaled to fit into the (12-627,9-182) actual range resulting in a line
being 2 instead of 3 pixels for the space as you showed. In my playing
around, I finally gave up trying to predict where it would bite me and
now I do my own range scaling by cuss & cry with the scalesw turned OFF.
Note that I assumed some values 4 lines up, they are not from any biblical
references!

Neither of those scenes might be whats biteing you, but I'm tossing it
out as food for thought.

In CirCad, how are you drawing those lines?  (i.e. are you using PutBlk

You're probably using a PClone with higher resolution.  If more than one
row of pixels on the GIF file map to the same row of pixels on the MM/1
display, what should gifshow do?  (I suppose it could try to average
the values.)

Joel,
 The other replies, from WDTV5 and JEJONES, reminded me of
something I have been overlooking - (actually, I figured it
out once and then forgot it -- bad).

 I am drawing with SetDPtr and Line commands in a window that is
slightly reduced from the full screen size.  It is scaling that
is beating up on me.  As the others pointed out, when you try to draw
more lines than the monitor has, some of them will have to go.

Okay.  Larry also posted some source code that relied on scaling (using
a 320-pixel width screen but referencing 640-pixel coordinates) so I
suspected that might have been the trouble with his code, but I
converted the coordinates to 320-pixel resolution and turned scaling off
and had the same resulting problems.  However, I believe the problem is
within the PutBlk() function and not in the SetDPtr and Line functions,
since I've used those with scaling very frequently without problems.

The NEC entry would probably work fine -- you might also try the
DeskJet entry and change the "300" to "360".  You could copy the
Deskjet entry and change it's name to EPSTY300 (or something) - just
make sure the default style at the end of the modes.mf file and in
the config.ps file matches.

Margins on my DeskJet are about 1-7/8".  Size is 10 points.  If you
chose that 360x180 entry for modes.mf, that might explain the
"squashed" letters.

     Gime Chip Source
     From: MARTYGOODMAN To: ALL

The following was posted on Internet by Glenn A. Emelko:

Just to let all you Coco III folks out there know....

Performance Concepts, Inc (my company) produced a large number of
Coco-III based imbedded systems in the late 80's and early 90's, and
when the Coco-III was officially phased out we purchased the remaining
supply of GIME chips (the main custom graphics controller in the
Coco-III) direct from Tandy as a Tandy VAR.  We still have a fair
supply of these chips left, and though we must keep some as repair
stock we may be willing to sell about 50 of them.  Please contact me
if you are interested.

     RE: Monitor Headache (Re: Msg 91136)
     From: MARTYGOODMAN To: CHARLESAM

The original NEC Multisync I monitor, and the NEC Multisync 1 plus,
and the NEC Multisync 2 also, I believe, quite happily synced down
to 15.75 KHz.   As it happens, I have several NEC Multisync monitors here,
including the Multisync 1, and would consider selling one of them.
The problem of course is shipping.   Color monitors are a bit delicate
to ship (one can knock their shadow mask out if they get too hard
a bump in transit, rendering them worthless and unrepairable).
UPS blue lable offers somewhat less bumpy handling, tho it can get
VERY expensive... over $40 for a 35 lb package.

Many other monitors from that vintage offerred 15.75 KHz sync capability.
I use a Tatung monitor on one of my PC compatibles from that vintage,
and it also syncs down to 15.75 KHz (I tested it on my CoCo and
it worked just fine).  The Sony 1302 of course also syncs down
to 15.75 KHz.   Genreally speaking, many of the high end name brand
monitors from 1986 to about 1989  tended to support CoCo style
H sync frequencies.   If the monitor uses a 9 pin DB connector, it
and if it supports VGA sync, it probably also supports 15.75 KHz sync,
especially if it is from that 1986 to 1989 period I mentioned.


After 1990, with CGA officially regarded as hopelessly ancient and
obsolete and worthless (as low end VGA monitors were then costing
no more than previous CGA monitors, and cheap VGA cards were becoming
readily avialable) there became much less reason for makers of
medium to high end monitors to support low sync rates, and it
made sense to save a good deal of money (and pass that on to their
VGA - using customers) by not supporting 15.75 KHz sync.   I would
guess that, apart from  die hard CoCo, Atari, and Amiga users,
the market for 15.75 KHz sync - capable analog monitors is limited
to very high end professional TV broadcast applications.


Let me think about about parting with one of my precious vintage
multisync monitors, but I suspect I really SHOULD sell off one of
them, if only because I can use the money toward a new mountain bike!

If you should wish to part with one, I'll pick up the shipping as you
mentioned. It will be worth it to have a half way decent monitor. E-mail
me the cost with the premium shipping included and I'll send off a money
order right away. Please don't wait too long cause I have to solve this
problem soon. Thanx too for all the info on multisync monitors. If you
don't sell, maybe I can find one at a ham fest in the area, now that I
know what I'm looking for. PS, if you do decide to sell me one, please
include the cable, even if I have to pay a few more bucks. Again thanx

Don't panic, Gene .... I've got a manual right here.

Lessee ... setting it up for parallel operation involves a couple of things.

First, switch 8 on the front panel dips is set to off to enable the parallel
interface. Switches 1-4 set the character set ... all off for US ASCII.
5 sets 7bit (on) or 8bit (off)

Nothing on the back set of dip switches need to be messed with as they
pertain to baud rate and parity. The jumper plug SP2 can enable or
disable the 8th bit when using the parallel interface by placing the jumper
over the center stake and the side marked "B".

Hope this helps ... let me know if you need any other info.

In basic09 (osk version) I am creating a 'type' of variable.
2 questions:
#1.  Can this be in a header file much like '.h' files for C, or macros
     for assembler?
#2.  How can you continue the TYPE over more than 1 line to maintain
     readability.
     My type definition is about 120 characters long, but every time I try
     to do continuation, it gives me errors.

  TYPE statements are closer to a structor than a .h or marco. Yes they
can be multiline. I use "me' for my editor and all I do is keep typing in
the data. When I list it under Basic, basic will wrap it just fine. I am
not sure what would happen if I did a CRLF and continued on the next line.
  BTW, I'll see if I still have that code, where I was using a UNION to
send data statements to.

    Yes, the DV Cartridge is a very powerful processor. Unfortunately, when
I asked a rep from Philips about it awhile back, he said it could only be
used for decoding DV files. He said programmers have no direct access to it
and therefor can't utilize its considerable processing power for their own

   Jim,
       Apparently Delphi got tired of all the complaints I was leaving all
   over, the message finally stopped showing up. I still don't know what
   happened, Allen left one message, that I responded to, then on his second
   message it started repeating. I tried twice to leave another message to him
   but they kept getting returned, USER Unknown, but his second message kept
   comming in about once an hour, strange...
       Delphi was real helpful, they suggested things like, why don't you
   respond to the message and tell them to stop sending it, yea... like I
   didn't think of that, geezz.

       Changing the subject, my subscription to the Underground lapsed and I
   havn't sent the renewal in yet, but what I was wondering was what is the
   availability and cost of back issues, and what is the current volume and
   issue number. I want to send in the renewal but I would also like to
   pick up the issues I missed.

It was a problem on GEnie's end.  I saw your message here and forwarded
it to Allen who forwarded it to someone named Andy in the upper
eschelons of GEnie, who fixed the problem.  GEnie has had quite a few
problems with it's Internet handling capabilities (one of many reasons
why I left) and Delphi customer service is never of any help in any
circumstances (but for some reason I stay on here... probably because
it's so cheap).  <grin>

Abstract:  MOUSE BALLS NOW AVAILABLE AS FRU


Mouse balls are now available as a Field Replacement Unit (FRU).  If
a mouse fails to operate, or should perform erratically,  it may be in
need of a ball replacement.  Because of the delicate nature of this
procedure,  replacement of mouse balls should be attempted by trained
personal only.

Before ordering,  determine type of mouse balls required by examining the
underside of each mouse.  Domestic balls will be larger and harder than
foreign balls.  Ball removal procedures differ,  depending upon manufacturer
of the mouse.  Foreign balls can be replaced using the POP-OFF method,  and
domestic balls replaced using the TWIST-OFF method.  Mouse balls are not
usually static sensitive,  however excessive handling can result in sudden
discharge.  Upon completion of ball replacement,  the mouse mat be used
immediately.

It is recommended that each servicer have a pair of balls for maintaining
optimum customer satisfaction and that any costumer missing his balls should
suspect local personnel of removing these necessary functional items.

     Microsoft buys LDS

 From: Doug Gwilliam <DOUGGW@WORDPERFECT.COM>

 MICROSOFT to Acquire LDS Church

 SALT LAKE CITY (AP)- In a surprise move that left competitors
 stunned, Microsoft has followed up its successful merger with the
 Roman Catholic Church by announcing a cash buyout of the Church of
 Jesus Christ-Latter Day Saints.  In recent weeks, high officials of
 the LDS Church (more commonly known as the Mormons) had been rumored
 to be in negotiations with both Novell and Lotus, but the Microsoft
 move came as a complete surprise to most industry/religious
 observers.  With much of Microsoft's competition based in Utah, many
 current employees of Word Perfect and Novell commented (anonymously)
 that they would feel morally obliged to jump ship to Microsoft.
 Novell is countering by pointing to non-competitive clauses in
 senior personnel's contracts, and urging conversion to the
 Reorganized LDS Church, with whom Novell has entered into hasty

 PA: MICROSOFT to Acquire @LDS Church
 PA: SALT LAKE CITY (AP)- In a surprise move that left competitors
 PA: stunned, Microsoft has followed up its successful merger with the
 PA: Roman Catholic Church by announcing a cash buy out of the Church of
 PA: Jesus Christ-Latter Day Saints.  In recent weeks, high officials of
 PA: the LDS Church (more commonly known as the Mormons) had been rumored
 PA: to be in negotiations with both Novell and Lotus, but the Microsoft
 PA: move came as a complete surprise to most industry/religious
 PA: observers.  With much of Microsoft's competition based in Utah, many
 PA: current employees of Word Perfect and Novell commented (anonymously)
 PA: that they would feel morally obliged to jump ship to Microsoft.
 PA: Novell is countering by pointing to non-competitive clauses in
 PA: senior personnel's contracts, and urging conversion to the
 PA: Reorganized LDS Church, with whom Novell has entered into hasty
 PA: negotiations.
 PA: Microsoft spokespersons officially denied any intent to pirate
 PA: Novell employees with this move, though they indicated that they

 Of course it's a joke!  It's poking fun at Microsoft's propensity for buying
 up competitors and and at the almost cult-like adulation Bill Gates recieves
 for his business savvy.

 How could anyone take seriously things like "convert the dead technology" or
 "requiring deceased church members to purchase annual upgrades in order to
 maintain their eternal salvation" unless their BS detector badly needs a
 tune up?

I wondered that too, but decided it wasn't too surprising based on the

 At a lecture I attended this afternoon, Michael Shermer of the
 Skeptics society mentioned an earlier part of the the legend about
 Microsoft buying the Catholic Church as an example of things to be
 skeptical of.  After the lecture, someome came up and told him that
 he had read an article an the Wall Street Journal reporting that
 MS had released a press statement denying the rumor!

 I think I erased that one but it was full of things like Bill Gates
 would be made a member of the College of Cardinals with father Guido
 Sarducci officiating at the cermony, the Pope would be made a vice
 president in charge of religious software and how you would be be
 able to make a confession, gain absolution and even reduce you time
 in purgatory right from your Windows equiped P.C.  I would think any
 reasonably intelligent person would be deafened by the alarms coming
 from their BS detector but people were taking it seriously!

 I have another phoney press release claiming that Microsoft has
 bought the entire year 1995 by offering to pay off the National
 Debt.  Gates then renamed it to "Year-M" with 1995 to follow next
 year.  This is so he won't have to rename Windows '95 again...

Hi, Frank.

FYI.

I received the December issue of 68'micro on 6 January 1995 which
may be a reasonable time since I don't know when it was sent. Also the
pages were in reverse order with page three as the last page and page 28 as
the second page, and there was no back cover.

I wonder if you thought about giving present subscribers a chance to renew
at the old rates before they went up.

I like the issue especially the articles by Colin, Ed and Joel. Keep up the
good job.

     WD1002A-27X RLL Cntrlr Card
     From: 01GEN40      To: ALL

  Hello to everyone and may the CHARGERS win the Super Bowl!

  I am seeking some info on a WD1002A-27X HD controller card, (RLL).  I
am currently using an MFM system and want to switch to the RLL.  My int-
erface is the Burke & Burke XT/RTC W/Xt-ROM.  On all the WD1002A-WX1
controller cards I have or have seen have had a socketed EPPROM(sp).
The ...-27X card does not have an EPROM but has an IC (28 PIN) in the
same general location as the EPROM on the ...-WX1.  Is this an EPROM
replacement?  Can I de-solder this chip, put in a socket and install
my XT-ROM?  Or, is it part of the RLL circuitry?  I cannot find anything
on this in the documentation that came with my XT interface.  Any help
on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you all in advance!

I got my serial mouse working but it only works in slot1 of mpi. I currently
use that for telecommunications rs232pak. Can anyone tell me what value to
put in $0016 of cc3io to utilize sloot2 of mpi? Right now I believe its 26.
Any help will be appreciated. Charlie
PS I really like the improvement in the mouse operation. Sorry I waited so

I'm in the market for a coco3 mother board as I blotched a solder job on

the one backup I had. It needn't have a cpu since I'm installing a 6309
anyway. If you only have a complete Coco3, I'll take that too, as long as
its not too expensive. Memory is not important. E-mail me with price if
you got what I need. Thanx Charlie

   Hello Joel,

   I grabbed the `termcap1' file from the data base here and I must say,
that was great information!  I have to catch part 2, for sure.

   What I wanted to know is, what did you use to archive that file ?
I have lha 201, 205, 206, and 208 on my MM1 and none of those would
give a listing or un-archive it :)  I went back on line and got the
ascii version <G>.  Thanks in advance Joel!

     RE: Bad MPI??? (Re: Msg 91381)
     From: JRUPPEL      To: DBREEDING (NR)

I have experienced similar problems to what you are describing in the past and
have traced it to two sources: the connections, in particular, the one between
the coco and the mpi and the power supply. It seems that the MPI gets it's 5v
from the Coco through the cocobus, so if you have(like I do) a fully populated
multipak, you are taxing the Coco's supply to the max. I have repowered my mpi
froma 200w power supply in a tower case that I have all of my drives in and
that seems to solve the problem. Evevntually, I will have the whole Coco in the
tower (If I can shut it down long enough).
As for cleaning contacts, I've found that an eraser works best, if I get all of
the debris out of the way before I plug it back in.
Good luck! Keep that Coco runnin'!
