Hello fellow OS9ers. This appeared in FidoNet's OS9_echo:

Conf    : 17 - OS9 National Echo

I saw a bit this morning on PBS's The Computer Chronicles which
featured a new interactive television system from Microware.

The system is called DAVID (caught my attention at once) which
stands for Digital Audio Video Interface Device and it uses OS9 as
its operating system.  Note that it's OS9, not OSK or similar.

This appears to be a classic "industrial" OS9 implementation, with
the system resident in ROM and accessed through heirarchical menuing.
The interface device?  A standard-looking TV remote control!

The software offers view-on-demand movies, interactive commercial
and retail services, weather and emergency connections and, of
coures, game playing ability.  More, as well.

No fixed release date, yet, but very interesting, none the less.

OS9 lives on!

Actually, OS-9 is the correct "generic" term for all versions of of the
operating system. OSK is just a contraction of "OS-9 68000" or "OS-9 68K".

I believe that DAVID currently makes use of a 68k type chip, rather than a
6809.

Ian,

since it the difference between user/group and task is very important for me I
will try to find out the real truth about these Private Alarms. My hardware
vendors support division is happy about questions like this one! So whenever I
know something new, I will let you know.

Bye

Sb: #ftpd source ?
Fm: Gerd Gotthard 100135,262
To: all

Hello,
I would like to write an application similar to the Microware implementation of
ftpd. It would be great if someone could supply the sources of ftpd or a
similar utility.
ftpd solves some programming problems:
  - ftpdc has no parent process (parent ID: 0), but it is forked by ftpd.
  - ftpd has to F$WAIT for ftpdc. But it doesn't. ftpd accepts immediatly new
client
    connections.
  - ftpd cleans up any socket resource (no 'address already in use' errors)

Any help will be appreciated
        Gerd

Check the LINUX archives. LINUX is a FREE implementation (and a GOOD one) of
Unix, and the sources to everything in it are available. You'll hav to do a
little bet surfing.

A good place to start would be ftp.infomagic.com or sunsite.unc.edu.
