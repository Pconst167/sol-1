Yes, I too have noticed the drop off in messages here.  It might
not all be sue to a lack of interest in OS9, though.  There are so
many competing services nowadays with Usenet news groups, the Internet
in general, Fido and BBS's and Echo's, etc.

On the other hand, and at the risk of starting an argument here,
I blame a lot of this on some short-sighted attitudes by CoCo users
who would not spend $900 on a nice machine a few years ago but will
now spend $1,800 on a Windows PC.  I have one myself!  I suspect
Windows 95 will take over everything, including Consumer CD-video
machines.  Not that I'm happy about it, mind you.

Hear the other day that Windowz 95 has a rather nasty error that crashes the
system if you try to "multitask" more than 3 or 4 programs.  Microsoft plans
to release it anyway though, providing upgrades (patches) later.  Still I
suspect other error will pop up and people will have problems with it.
Of course this just gives all those local Windowz consultants happy, as more
and more people call them to help set up there systems and "learn" how to
use it.  I see advertisements for these folks all the time.

Agreed!  It really doesn't matter whether it's any good or
not.  It will be the standard, OS/2 (or OS9) will make no impact.

If Delphi did not complain, I would guess that Chris' account is still
active. Of course, here active means paid, not necessarily used. Do remember
that the "/ent" command only shows the last time the person was in this area.
I do not know of a way to globally check last delphi access.

     RE: IRQ Hack. (Re: Msg 92212)
     From: GREGL        To: PAUL8

Just as an idea, Paul, I have my system set up like this:

        COM1    IRQ 5   14.4Kbps modem
        COM2    IRQ 3   Mouse
        COM3    IRQ 4   TNC
        COM4    IRQ 3   Unused

I did mine this way because the 9600 bps modem I was using could be set to
COM 1 or COM 2 only so I physically cut the IRQ trace from IRQ 4 and jumpered
it (soldered a wire) to the IRQ 5 pin. When I got the new modem, I kept things
simple so just jumpered it for COM 1/IRQ 5. All of the packet software I
have (PaKet 6.0, TPK, etc.) can be set to COM 3 so it worked out fairly well.

As a suggestion, I'd change your setup to the following:

        COM1    IRQ 4   TNC or Mouse
        COM2    IRQ 3   TNC or Mouse
        COM3    IRQ 5   Modem

This leaves COM 4 open for future use. The big problem is figuring out which
interrupt to use for COM 4. I don't think OS/2 will let you use IRQ 7 because
that's used for LPT 1. Here's a list of the standard interrupts to help sort
all this out:

        IRQ 00  System Timer
        IRQ 01  Keyboard
        IRQ 02  [Cascade]
        IRQ 03  COM 2/COM 4
        IRQ 04  COM 1/COM 3
        IRQ 05  LPT 2
        IRQ 06  Floppy controller
        IRQ 07  LPT 1
        IRQ 08  Realtime Clock
        IRQ 09  available
        IRQ 10  available
        IRQ 11  available
        IRQ 12  available
        IRQ 13  Math Coprocessor
        IRQ 14  Fixed Disk
        IRQ 15  available

If you don't have a second printer port, you can use IRQ 5 for other
purposes. To the above, I have COM 1 on IRQ 5 and my Sound Blaster Pro on
IRQ 10. Also, IRQ 2 is routed to IRQ 9 so you might consider them as the
same interrupt.

Paul,

You need to FTP, download and run a utility called "FINDIRQ" from the PC
Magazine database at ftp.pcmag.ziff.com.  It is a DOS utility which
graphically lists all the IRQs currently used and currently free on your
system.

Good luck.

Yeah.  It seems CD might be a problem with all the systems.. Ed told me
that some of his users had complained about CD detection with some of his
systems, too.

Yeah, I think this was a problem with the coco, too..  With us, our systems
don't support DMA, and I think I've tried accessing the floppy during
telecom, and lost data there.  Don't have any problems with the HD, though.
I think I have caused lost characters when moving a window and holding the
mouse button down too long (haven't tried it since I've worked on my serial
driver, this might be fixed now).

Our 68681 driver as it came had not been fine-tuned as much as they could
have.  They have a serial card for the system, and Ed said they had devoted
their attention to it more, and after they got it fixed, did not see any
need to work on improving this serial driver any more.

Hopefully Carl Krieder will have the CD problem fixed in the next version
of the driver. He does know about the problem, and believes he has a fix
for it, just hasn't had the time to implement it yet. (He's known
about the problem for over a year now) I sure hope he fixes it soon...
It was one of the reasons I had to switch SandV BBS to different hardware.

I have had problems with hard disk access messing up serial comunications
(even with maxcount=2048) most notably during zmodem downloads (and
unforch, my zmodem port doesn't want to recover nicely from transmission
errors all the time, have to work on that some day).

   One thing I did here was to give the receive & send buffer for T3 and
T4 2048 bytes each.  This helped me out.  Even thou zmodem looks for 1024,
I bumped this up to 2K.  Like chicken soup, it couldn't hurt <g>.

    I don't know if anyone else has mentioned this to you yet, but the
problem is with reading from the joystick while *recording* sound. Gold
Runner 2000 is constantly reading the joystick while continuously playing
its soundtrack with no problems at all. I think you would be hard pressed
to come up with a situation, a legitimate one at least, in which you were
using the joystick at the same time you were recording sound, so I don't
see this as much of a problem at all.

   Thanks for clearing that up, I didn't know that the A/D conflict only
comes in during recording, but now that I think of it, it makes sense.

Hi JJ!!

  Any SCSI CDRom drive should work for file access, but, the audio commands
vary by manufacturer. So far, I support audio commands for NEC, Chinon,
and a 'generic' SCSI2 thru separate versions of VCDP (the Virtual CD Player).
But, a single version of CDF has handled all SCSI drives. In Fact: I know
a fellow that is running an ATAPI (enhanced IDE) drive using CDF!!!

  See previous post to BOISY about Software and CDRom drive packages at the
'fest.

The pins on the 512K board sometimes go through the connector and ground on
the board or shielding under the motherboard.

Chips leads will corrode some when left idle! I had this problem with an
older 80286 motherboard that has about five PLCC chips in it. Had to pull
them all, clean the sockets and chip leads (experience with the CoCo GIME
led me to try this as a possible solution!!), and then it worked fine. The
board was pulled from a working computer and sat for about a year before
being put back in service. The first thing I tried was pulling and reseating
all 36 20 pin DRAM chips (1MB x 1 bit)! What a chore!! (was getting memory
errors) The PLCCs came out when that failed. About three months later
started having random problems. The PLCCs came out and were cleaned again.
This time I reinstalled them then sprayed 'em all with a coating of WD-40
(non-conductive!). No more problems, and the WD-40 coating should prevent
most corrosion for a while!
