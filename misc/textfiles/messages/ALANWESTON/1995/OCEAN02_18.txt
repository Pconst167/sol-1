Took me a while to figure out what you were replying to...  Checked the
message base & found the culprit - a test message that I posted in this
echo back on 02-Nov-94 23:06.  Quick reply - almost as quick as mine
<snicker>.
 
Seriously, though...  You might say I'm familiar with OS9 (the 8-bit
version, anyway), as I've been using it on a CoCo for the last 5 or 6
years.  I've been wanting to move to the OSK platform, but... same old
song & dance: money & lack thereof.
 
As for TimeShare Data Systems, it's not a business (yet? who knows), nor
is it used in industrial applications.  It's simply my BBS.  As you may
or may not know (probably not, actually <g>), I'm the current developer
for the 'original' RiBBS BBS package which runs on the Tandy Colour
Computer 3 under OS9 Level 2.  I've been tearing through the code since
late August of '94 & judging by how long it took me to reply back to you, 
I think I should take some time off! <snicker>

This is primarily for Clyde Price, but may be of interest to others.

Below are the patches to keydrv #48 CRC $A8EA84 which will patch
it to use the two-handed Dvorak layout CRC $751917. I also have
the one-handed layouts for left and right hands, if anyone needs
them.

A patched version of keydrv should be on Ocean Beach by the time you
get this message. I'm also working on a program to do the changes
on the fly, but it isn't done yet. When finished, I'll pass on a
copy to David for distribution with the MM/1, as well as releasing
it to the public.

TTYL. Colin.

DED patches to convert KeyDrv 48 to Dvorak Two-Handed Layout

Hi, Clyde.

Oops, messed up in my last message -- I completely forgot the Control
table. At any rate, I have put together the program, and will send it to
Ocean Beach via Internet. No need for the patches any more.

Here's the help (-?) entry for the program:

     Dvorak (C) 1995 Colin McKay v1.0

     Function: Changes keyboard layouts for KeyDrv 48.
     Syntax  : dvorak <option>
     Options : -s Standard
               -d Dvorak (two-handed)
               -l Left-handed
               -r Right-handed

     Released for no-charge distribution by Northern Xposure.

It should meet your needs.

TTYL. Colin.

Subject : OSTerm 68K and WindIO 54...
Date    : 95/02/12  14:34:00

 Hi, all.
 
 For OSTerm 68K v2.2.0 and higher owners who will be using the
 newer versions of Windio (53.10 and higher):
 
 The new version of WindIO 'breaks' Andrzej Kotanski's keyboard
 hack (since the tables have been moved and rearranged.) Things
 like Ctl-c and other combinations aren't recognized by OSTerm
 68K. However there is a simple fix:
 
 Add the following line to your osterm.config file:
 
 NOKEYKLUGE = TRUE
 
 The correct Ctl-KEY codes will now be generated with the following
 exceptions:
 
 When ANSI keypad is enabled, the following four special sequences
 must now be used:
 
    To Generate        Use key sequence
    -----------        ----------------
      Ctrl-F            Alt-Ctrl-F
      Ctrl-N            Alt-Ctrl-N
      Ctrl-P            Alt-Ctrl-P
      Ctrl-B            Alt-Backspace
 
    (Alt-Ctrl-B is stolen for "move window to back")
 
 Once the new WindIO is stable, a fixed version of OSTerm 68K will
 be sent to all OSTerm 68K owners, at no charge.
 
 TTYL. Colin.

Hi, Russ.

Dunno if you and David talked yet, but I talked to Kevin, and he does have
your machine, and he is attempting to repair it. Didn't supply an estimated 
time though.

So at least you know it got through ok.

TTYL. Colin.

Colin,
    Thanks for checking with Kevin Pease on this.  I hope he can fix it
and get it out soon.
    BTW I hear Nitros9 update is mailing now, wondered when I can look
to the mail box and find.  Also you had volunteered to beta test
RiBBS_OSK and would also send blank disk for that.  Are you still
interested ?
