Colin it seems that the problem with the sick MM/1 is the I/O board. The 
CPU and accelerator work just fine. We are trying to determine what is 
wrong with it.

Hi, Steve.

An MM/1 is a brand of computer that runs OS-9/68000. Warren Hrach on this
echo can give you the full sales pitch, if you want more info.

Ok, now, that kind of explains some things.  Like what comes with it and
all, btw...whats the cost in American dollars?  Is there a demo?  Will
it run existing programs written for Atari GEM/TOS?  Do I have to buy
all new programs to make use of this OS?  Do my hard drives have to be
reformatted?  :)  I am interested and curious, so....

Please enlighten me.

  You know, I totally forgot about this until today, but I don't ever remember
hearing a 'beep' out of the internal speaker on my machine, either. (Although
that's the main CPU board, not the I/O.)

       Calvin Dodge has done it again,  Now RiBBS_OSK can do the Fido
part between my CoCo Fido BBS and Calvins.  I also tested between my own
MM/1 and this bbs and the send/receive is working very well.  Still need
some polishing and minor bug fixes but all in all it is getting close to
a public release.  Should be ready for the Chicago Fest !

 I wanted to post this message to thank you for this information.
 I was also going to ask how much, but when I read the bottom of your
message, I noticed it said source is in the U.K and costs 99 pounds.
I take this to mean that it has to be ordered from Britain/Europe
and it costs $99 English Pounds?  Any US distributors?

OS-9 is a Unix-like multitasking operating system that is used a lot in
"real time" applications, e.g. robot submarines, CD-i players, ATMs,
airport luggage handling systems (*not* the one in Denver :-).  It
started out in life on the 6809, moved to the 68xxx family, and in a more 
portable version exists on the 80x86 (x >= 3) and the PowerPC.
 
Let's see...Microware sells (or sold; I'm not sure about current
availability) OS-9 for the Atari ST, and an English company called Cumana 
Ltd. sells (or sold) a port of OS-9 for the ST as well.

I don't know the answer to most of your questions except that

  1. - The Price Is In Pounds Not U.S. Dollars so will varry with the
  exchange rate. But 99 Pounds was aprox.     is aproximaa couple of
  months ago, any Bank will be able to give you the exact rate.ely $160

  I don't think that  you can run ATARI TOS programs under OS-9/68K
  However If K-Windows gets ported to the ATARI you will be able to run MOST
  MM/1 compatable programs and be able to easly port most COCO Basic09
  programs that you have the code for. Most TEXT only applications will
  run unaltered.

  I do not have ATARI OSK however 2 people In the local computer club
  I am a member of do have it on there systems they will be able to tell
  you If you need to repartition your hard disk or not, return me a Message
  with your complete FIDO NET address and I will see If either Mike or
  Paul would like to give you more details.

  Also I am not sure If they have Cummen OSK or another one so ask,
  from what I have heared Cummen OSK is the best deal. But If money
  is no Object the MACINTOSH version of OSK will run allmost all
  standatd Mac Apps under it but it costs $1200 U.S.

    Most Banks will sell you Money Orders Denominated In Forign Currency
    99 Pounds will probably cost you 150 to 160 US $.

    No I Don't Think So, Although I have heared that Black Hawk
    Enterprises will be distributing the K-Windows Package When
    (? if ?) it comes out.

    Yes.

    I Personally know 2 people who have the package so If you have
    any Indepth questions I will put you in touch with them.

Yes, but some one still has to maintain the list.  The easiest way to do
this is with a listserv.  This list *IS* Private!  Only those who David
allows are added.  The "subscribe method" is simply a convenience - requests
are mailed directly to David.

There is nothing to hide.  However, it is not always a good idea (from a
sales point of view) to let your potential customers know what you are up to
until it's ready for sale.  The intent of this echo is as a PRIVATE area for
MM1 developers to help each other.  I.E. if you ain't a programmer, you're
not invited... at least, that's my understanding.  I think it has gotten a
little out of hand.  Messages posted here have traveled a little farther
than they should have.

By far the easiest way to order stuff from overseas is to use the right
