Ok, so once I paid for this OS, where would I find applications for it?

There's the chestnut FTP site, and various BBSs (like this one!) and
information utilities.  I'd suggest taking a look at one of the various
magazines, such as *The World of 68 Micros*, for ads from companies that
sell software.

Colin,
        I haven't had time to do much online lately, and haven't even 
been using my System IV for a while. I just got your messages after 
logging on to ACS BBS (after _too_ long not checking by), and my screen 
seems set for no-paging ... so I haven't even completely read your 
messages.
        I gather that there is now a Dvorak option for OSK machines, 
and, no, I haven't had the chance to try it yet... but as soon as I 
dust off the System IV, I'll be sure to download it and give it a try!
  
        This will make OSK _much_ more useable for me, even though I've 
been able to use hardware keyboards up til now.  Thanks a lot for your 
labors!

  If you are going to Chicago Fest and want to try out RIBBS_OSK, then
bring a 3 inch MM1 formatted diskette. Format it with 

     typ=$27  sct=37 t0s=37

  The diskette will be a ready to run BBS with a 100K messagebase. To run
the diskette, see the Ribbs Docs file on the diskette.
  You will need to copy the following to the CMDS directory on the diskette.

  RunB,TMode,Dir,Del,Shell, Bgfx,Date,lha, & Math

  Remember this is a BETA release, thus there may be some features that are
still buggy or not working.

Clyde, you might have trouble using this option on the System IV.
The command is for an MM/1 with Keydrv 47 or 48 and windio 54.

  If you are going to Chicago Fest and wish to get a BETA copy of
         
          RIBBS_OSK for the MM/1

then you will need to bring a MM/1 formatted diskette with you. Make sure
you do a dmode /d1 typ=$27 sct=37 t0s=37.

  This will allow us to do a backup and easly make you a copy. After you
have copied Runb,Shell,TMode,Dir,Del,Lha,Display,Shell,Math,Copy you will
have a fully functional BBS with a 100K MessageBase. It will still have
over 300K free space. The RIBBS OS9 DOCS file is included.
  If you have used RIBBS OS9, then this will be a snap for you. We have
made some improvements over the OS9 version. Namely RIBBS_OSK will run
LOCKED BAUD at 38400, if you also have a hi-speed modem that will allow
it. It also runs 100X faster than the OS9 version.
  This has been many months of hard work for the BETA Team. Porting the
orginal Basic09 and 6809 assembly code over to OSK Basic and 68000 
assembly code and making it all work, was IMHO well worth it. Now we can
start using the MM/1 in a new way.
  Remember this is a BETA release. Thus you may find some small bugs or
area/functions that may not work correctly.

  See you all in Chicago. Stop by the Blackhawk booth for a demo of this
and KTerm V3.0.
