Hey, all..

Can we get a decent connection through Internet Service Providers using OS-9?
In particular OSK?  I must admit that I am pretty much in the dark about this
aspect of telecomm.

I have downloaded KAQ9 and have UUCPbb, but have not as yet studied the docs,
but it is my understanding that you _can_ get an account set up with providers?
Or at least some?

Our local Telephone Co. is in the process of setting up an Internet Service.
They will be providing their own software, and I really have not gotten any
definitive answers to the question.  (Actually, the person who they said could
answer my questions best is off on maternity leave).

I would not be particularly interested in the graphical services of the Web
anyway.  My main interest would be in Telnetting to my CIS and Delphi accounts,
FTP, and probably a few newsgroups, and of course E-Mail.

I know this is a rather vague and general question.  If there is a text file
available that might answer my questions, I'd appreciate if of someone would
point me to it.

I think I'll post this on both CIS and Delphi to get as broad a possibility of
answers as possible.

In the meantime, I'll do some homework with the docs I have..  they may answer
my questions anyway..  Thanks all.

Hi David.

I use telnet all the time to access CI$. I have an account with a local service
provider...well, a bit more complicated than that. I have an account with a
local company who lease a line from here (Creston, BC) to a large UNIX system
in Kelowna, BC (about 150 miles). I dial up a local number and that connects me
to the UNIX system where I have a shell account.

I then type a command:

        telnet compuserve.com

and it creates a link to CIS. Most of the time it works fine....but I have
heard of other folks getting very slow response. Mind you, I've had slow
response from CIS from time to time dialing up direct too.

The only problem I had was uploading binary files. But I solved that...I use
the "-E" option with telnet if I am going to be uploading. This disables the
escape character...which means that I have to either disconnect or hope that
CIS recognises the "bye" command. Usually not a problem <g>.

This method has saved me a lot of $$ in long distance charges....before I got
the internet account I had to dial long distance to Vancouver to access a CIS
node. Now I have to pay my local internet guy...but for $20/month I get 1 hour
per day. This is fairly pricy compared to what other folks pay, espeically in
the big cities. But, considering that the bulk of the charges are paying for
the leased line between here and Kelowna it seems to be okay. Besides, with
only one provider in the area I really have no choice.

Hope this helps.

Thanks for the reply, Bob.  I am trying to learn all I can with this.

Yes, I recall reading one of your messages about this.  it sounds kind of neat.

If I understand a "shell account" is something like logging onto an OS-9 system
with "login"??  Do I have this concept close?

With this type of connection, do you just use something like Sterm on your
system?  Or is a specialized program still required?

(sorry for the dumb questions)...

I'm not sure what type of accounts we will have.  What we are getting is our
local phone company is starting up an Internet service.  I am not sure what
they will provide.  They will provide software - Wolongong's "Emissary"
Internet software.. I am not familiar with this.  They do mention activation
without using their software, so it might be possible that they will offer
options.

 > I then type a command:
 >
 > telnet compuserve.com

This is one feature that I would look forward to, since I, too, am without
local CIS access.  They do mention Telnet capability.

I do, too, on occasion, but most of the time, it is satisfactory with my direct
dial.

"bye" is the command I use all the time when I log on manually, but InfoXpress
uses a different method.  Hmm... I might not be able to use it for a connect
like this... I'll have to look into this..

Well, we won't be getting a bargain with our system, either.  Their proposed
rates will be $9.95 for 5 hr, $19.95 for 13 hr, and $29.95 for 25 hr.  For each
plan, additional hours are $2.00, $1.50, and $1 respectively.

I'm not doing _TOO_ badly with my long distance rates.  On weekends, I can call
for 8 cents a minute.  Weeknights are a little higher and I just stay clear of
weekdays <G>

 > Besides, with only one provider in the area I

I know what you mean.. <G>

 > Hope this helps.

Yes, it is giving me some valuable insight.

Thanks again for answering some questions that may well be very apparent, but
are foggy for me..

Right again. Matter of fact, sterm (my own, customized version) is my terminal
prog. of choice.

I seem to recall a thread on using InfoXpress via a telnet link. John?

Sounds pricy to me. Anyone else know about rates for this kind of stuff?

I guess we _all_ have our own customized versions of Sterm.  It seems to be a
really great workhorse.

Well, I guess you've found that I'm full of "smart" questions, then <VBG>

The only thing is that these are probably questions that have been asked
countless times, and here I am asking them again..

Yes, I saved a message from Bill about using scripts to log in from a telnet
account.  I have it saved somewhere, just need to find it.

Yes, it's kind of steep, but as you said about your account, when it's the only
playhouse in town....  :-)

I hear rumors that other providers may be moving into our territory.  If so,
then perhaps the price will become more pleasant..  But we may have to live
with this for starters.

It seems that you guys are substantiating what I suspected was the case.

As of now, I am hoping that our provider will support a shell account. I think
this would be exactly what I need.

I have not had a chance to talk to anyone who knows anything about the service
they will be providing.  I suspect that the phone co. will not be the provider,
but just provide a link to a host system in another city.  If this be the case,
then I may stand a bette chance of getting something I will be able to use.

If not, probably my only other chance for getting local service will be to get
a "real" <yeah, sure> computer.... >:(

Thanks  Bob, Steve, and Jim..  I really appreciate the help.

Dave,

Last time I looked KAQ9 would support a serial SLIP connection to an Internet
Services provider, but all you could expect is ftp. Unless something's recently
changed, the "telnet" that's included in the package is really nothing more
than a "chat" feature.

If you find out something different let us know.

Well, the lack of "telnet" would be a disadvantage.  Bob Van Der Poel sent me
some helpful information on how he was doing his connects.  I'm keeping my
fingers crossed hoping that we can get a shell account here.  It looks like
this would be my best option.  For my current usage, I don't have much need for
anything besides my OS-9 system, except for the dreamed-of Internet access.
But I don't see a big need on my part for the graphical aspects of the
browsers, especially until we can get an unlimited time plan here.

 > If you find out something different let us know.

Well, I'm out here in the boonies, so to speak, but I will be on the lookout
for good alternatives.

We had a discussion somewhere a while back, I think it might have been on
Delphi, but something was said about writing a browser for OSK.  Someone said
that something about it would be hard to get the code from Netscape.

However, this would not be required, would it?  The protocols are not
Netscape-specific, are they?  At the bottom rung, don't they utilize either
TCP/IP or SLIP (this _is_ a protocol, isn't it) ?  Wouldn't it just be a matter
of interpreting the graphics and going from there?

It would not be a small task, but not impossible, would  it?

Hi All.  I think David Breeding (s) had a question about ka9q and internet
accounts.  I think I have some answers that might help.  By the way, how to
tell cis that I want to reply to a singer single message?  I have to compose a
new message.  I curently just capture all the new messages and read them from
the capture buffer.

Anyway.

You phone company would probably want to sell you a PPP connection to the
internet, this is the most common connection for the PC folks.

The CoCo and I believe OSk can't use such an account directly.  But if they can
sell you a SLIP account which is the older standard of direct dial-up accounts,
that would work with KA9Q.  The CoCo version of KA9Q is way to slow and limited
to even be useful, but the osk version might justd work fine.

Most internet providers that use a Unix host can sell you a shell account. This
is where you login to the thier shell and use it like a bbs.

Once you have an account you can always telnet out to compuserve or elsewhere.
KA9Q does support telnet out, not telnet in.

Good luck, you will need it!  I use my Amiga for all my telecom now,
..

Jim

Can't you enter the command (for the above example) "rep 21278"?  That is, if
you're doing it online.

My system is a 25-MHz 68020.  I think I would have enough speed to handle my
needs.

This is what I am hoping they will provide.  I believe this will give me all
the features I will need.

I was hoping for this capability, but with the rates they will be giving, I'm
not sure if this would provide me with any savings or not.

Yes, it does seem like I may have to do some homework to get it going. From the
responses here, I am beginning to get more insight into it.
