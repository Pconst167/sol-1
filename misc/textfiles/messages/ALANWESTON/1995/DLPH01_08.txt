and presto? Huh, i shoulda done this years ago.

      Ahh, that's more like it, complicated enough for me. :) Would you be

I don't know if I will be able to make it to the fest.. I missed
Atlanta, so knowing me..

If you want one made up for you, but it's not that hard to do, just
get the connectors and squeeze them on.

If you want one made up, I can make one and send it to you.  Actually,
the 3.5's are really nice..  Probably the best setup would be be one
5.25 (for compatibility) and 2 3.5's. The 720K would really be good for
backing up your hard drive.

    $10 each back issue. There are two available as back issues. If you are
going to the next Chi Fest, I'll have them for sale there at my booth. I
am planning to be at my booth one day and touring another day for footage
and seminars. I'll have to decide when I see the agenda the day before.

     I'll let you know all know what I decide on getting. I think a Performa
475 (68LC040 66/33 with system 7.5 and double speed CD + integrated monitor)
pretty good price. I'll be one step ahead of Joel. :) (no CD-ROM, no sys 7)

    Ooops, didn't catch that until now. I had allways been using floppies
until I got my 240 Meg Quantam last year (I mean late '93 <g>). Now all I
do is push in my boot disk, and pop it out again, it never leaves the

Bill, I almost thought you were Bill Gates there!! ;>

Really, for most people 8MB of RAM is PLENTY on a Windows machine. OS/2
requires a minimum of 8MB (even though Warp WILL run in 4MB... but just
barely!). What you said about 16MB being required may be true for OS/2,
however, if you wish to do any real multi-tasking of DOS programs.

Most people DON'T really multi-task, however, they merely "task-switch".
OS-9 literate types. In that case, Windows doesn't perform
bad. I use a 486DX50 (NOT a DX2!!) with 8MB. I did have 4MB before. I also
use a 4MB machine at work. Anything over 8MB (we DO have a 16MB machine at
work) doesn't speed anything up to a noticeable degree. The 16MB machine
DOES do a good bit of true multi-tasking under Windows (as true as it gets,
anyway), and is fairly responsive. There are usually 3-4 things going on
in it at the same time. I wouldn't recommend THAT with 8MB or less!!

This makes sense.. and really agrees with what I've read in magazines.  At
this time, the biggest majority of PC's being assembled (well DX's and
above) are being equipped with 8 Meg.

How about the local computer store?  I have talked with our dealer, and
from what I can gather, it looks like one might get a system for maybe
$200-$300 more than the above.  I'm thinking this might be worth the price,
since you then have someone you can look at to provide your support.  I
understand that often it is difficult to make connection with the mail-order
houses for tech support.

Right.  I have a brother who has a mind of his own, it seems.  I tried, not
too forcibly, but did try to give him advice similar to what you said above.
But he wound up going to Wal-Mart and getting a Packard-Bell SX-25, it did
have CD-Rom and Sound.  His argument was.. "Well, this is all I'm ever going
to want to do.."<blah> <blah>.  However, now after about a couple month of
playing around and seeing what's what, he now is beginning to get the itch
to upgrade.  Right now, he wants to add a paralell port.  Don't know when
he'll realize he needs more than the 4 Meg he has.  And his HD?  Well, he's
not going to do all that much. 210 Meg is plenty, and he can add another
drive later... sure!  I fear that when he goes to trying to upgrade, he's
going to be a little sad about it.

Apparently you're satisfied with the Performa line.  They aren't
stripped-down models are they?  Does the LC cpu chip have any actual
shortcomings?

Well, for my part, if I were to get a PC (new), I'd go ahead and get 8 Meg.
It looks like that is what the sellers are now considering to be base
memory.

That's one of the many beauties of OSK..  My system has 4 Meg, and seems
like about all the modules are "sticky" <G>.  So far, even with G-Windows
running, I've never gotten free under about 2 Meg yet, and that's with
all the C compiler modules loaded and several processes running.

I have a P5-60 with 8 meg.  It has run out of memory on several occasions in
WFW 3.11 while opening multiple apps in MSOffice or receiving a fax and doing
anything else, or downloading a file and doing certain other tasks at the same
time, or using two or more apps and printing at the same time.  My permanent
Windows swap file is as large as possible too.  Those guys who sell the memory
managers might still get some of my money.  Installing 8 more megs and getting
the system to recognize it might be a trick too.  OS2, on the other hand,
would create virtual machines and use 55 megs of disk just for the OS.  Ah,
what a wonderful world of options.  Bigger hard disk, more memory and ever
more bloated code!...(As they take him out kicking and screaming...)

I agree... a new PC should have 8MB in it if it is to be used for anything
more than a little homework and games. With that in mind, I would think the
majority of real home users may never really need more that 4MB, except to
speed up the games a bit more!!

Those doing really serious work need the 8MB for speed under Windows. I know
my system acts more like the 50MHz it is now. That reminds me... you ever
heard of a POWER SUPPLY slowing a system down? MINE DID!!!

I originally had my 486DX50 (NOT a DX/2!!) in an XT case with 165W power
supply. Not a lot of load on it, just two floppies and a single 3.5" hard
drive, only three cards (hand scanner, video, and multi I/O). Well, it NEVER
booted right away... would always have to turn on then hit reset. Could hit
reset right after flipping the power switch and it would come right to life,
but no reset, blank screen. I recently bought a new case with 200W PS.
Problems gone, and the system seems "snappier" also!! Now I ran that XT
case PS on a 286/20MHz (that's right, a "hot rod" 286 with Harris processor)
for some time with no problems at all!! 165W should have been plenty, but I
guess
the XT style PS doesn't come to life as quick as the newer ones!!
I stuck the 20MHz board back in it and again, no problems! And the 286 board
HAS to suck more juice.... it has 4MB or DRAM on it and a 5.25" Seagate ST-251
hard drive!!

Bill, you should know better than to try real multi-tasking with an MS-DOS
box!! ;>

I see your point. But you ARE running some of the bigger memory hogs of
software. The USAF seems to be standardizing on MS Office, one reason is that
they can get it for a very good price bundled with new systems. Here at Robins
AFB, the small computer steering group HAS recommended
that no future systems be purchased with less than 8MB , partially because
of this standardization. The only thing I use that takes a good deal of memory
is my hand scanner program... the scanned in files are pretty big! I didn't
get it until I got 8MB installed.... I don't think I would have been able to
work
with more than one scan at a time with 4MB, now I can scan 4 pictures before
running out of memory to edit with. PageMaker runs a little faster, but is
due to Windows running faster, I think. I do a little task-switching, but no
real multi-tasking, except running CoCo at the same time!! ;>

I just use Microsoft Works for Windows for word processing, and Write. If
Write hada fhe beginning of the file
after a search and replace, but returned where you left off) and a spell
checker, I wouldn't use Works. I chose Works simply because it has all the
features really necessary (if I need fancy layout, I know PM really good!!)
while taking a minimum of space... the most efficient tool for the job I need!

Your tools, on the other hand, are large and cumbersome in comparison, but
at the same time much more powerful. But you probably NEED the power, whereas
most general users wouldn't. For a general, do-all business system, 8MB
is probably a bre minumum, with 16MB being more like it. But most people,
even in business, don't tax there machines as much as you seem to!!

That's just my point, Dave.  Given the memory-hogging aspects of ever more
bloated commercial code for the PC, the time to buy additional memory for your
system is at initial purchase time.  It is much cheaper that way and far less
hassle.

 Many *ARE* getting by on 4 MB, but I would think that the extra 4 would be
a pretty good investment.

Well, looks like that HD would probably pull more juice than the newer
one, but I understand that the "bigger" (i.e. more powerful) CPU
chips pull more power themselves, don't they?

BTW.. I saw something over in MACHW on CI$ yesterday, wonder if you or
anyone else might have a comment.  In replying to someone's question
RE: whether it's best to leave a system on all the time or turn it off,
someone made the comment that the currently-produced monitors don't
burn in, and that screensavers are not now necessary.  Of course, he might
have been talking about the power-down feature, but we don't have that
for our systems.  This one person said that he usually left his computer
on all the time (as I understood him), but would turn his monitor off.
I wonder, though if having the computer on and the lines going out in
open space, so to speak, for an extended period of time might be hard on
the video circuitry in the computer.

Any comments, anyone?

for us.  I wonder if anyone has attempted to get us started with
scanners.  Would it be worthwhile?  That is, would very many people be
interested?  Many are SCSI, aren't they?  Would they simply hook to the
SCSI port?  Could we get access to the format etc of the data to write
the program?

Yep, I know about keeping the lid off <G>. It's not, as I said "complicated"

Right.  I'd hate to get a system like that and then have to start modifying
it right at the start.  Of course, one need not go overboard, especially
if funds are limited, but what does it cost to go from 4MB to 8MB?  About
two hundred?  I'd say that would be a worthwhile investment.

I think most people, especially when buying their FIRST PC, badly
underestimate their needs.  After a couple, they finally get the picture <G>

 The version in the DB now was compiled with 3.2.  As soon as I put
 together the archives I'll be posting an updated version compiled
 with UCC.

 Microware's manuals say UCC 1.1 requires OS9 v 2.4++ or OS9/x86
 v1.3+ but I can't find where it sez whether the compiled code will
 run on earlier versions.  I'm taking the safe route and adding a
 warning label but if anyone knows for sure I'd like to know.

 With a few exceptions, the programs are identical.  For 90%+ of
 G-windows programming the differences can be accounted for with a
 few lines in a header file.

 I test the compiled programs with wfm 2.2 as well as 2.5 but that's
 as far back as I can go.  Gespac reported some problems with some of
 my programs on their systems but I never got enough information to
 resolve them.  They didn't seem too interested in them anyway.

 Yer durn tootin! :-)  I still have this illusion that I may actually
 be able to make money doing OS9 programmng someday and I can't see
 giving away the bank.

 Seriously, I'll answer any reasonable question and I have posted
 short programs to illustrate techniques for OS9 and G-windows
 programming but even a simple game like Blackjack takes a lot of
 time to write and I can't see giving away the source.

After re-reading my message, *I* didn't understand it either <G>

What I meant to ask was if your new source will be heavily modified (beyond
syntax).  I had thought that we might compare the speed between the two
different versions, but on second thought it occurred to me that most
of the time, the program is just waiting for user input, so we probably
couldn't tell much difference between the two.

 The source was modified to accomodate the syntax and new function
 names of and the structure of the program was change coniderably.
 Whne I started writing CyberWar I quickly realized that the
 technique I used to handle events in Blackjack wasn't near adequate
 for a more complex program.  When I decide to move Blackjack to UCC
 and OS9000, I modifed the program structure as well.  I also got
 lazy and use the demo version of Gview to create the startup window
 so hte program size inreased by a about 25K or 30K.

 Speed comparisons between 3.2 and UCC in most G-windows specific
 program probably won't yield much difference.  Most of the overhead
 in a graphics environment is the graphics.  In the case of G-Windows
 that is the realm of 'wfm' and the drivers - an application can't
 affect that too much.

Yes, I hadn't really thought of the graphic intensiveness of the
subject, but you're totally correct, and, as I said, the system is
spending more time waiting for input than it is in proceeding with
the program anyway.

I'm looking forward to seeing what UCC is like.  I hope it doesn't
go the way of everything else I've gotten.. I'm getting stuff so fast
that it seems that I get one thing, look at it, and before I even
learn the new commands, I get something else, and it seems I still
need more <G>

Right!
Why so many disk formats?  The same reason that we have so many
different `windowing' systems.  We seem to have a goal to give
each owner of an OSK system his own unique disk format and
display system.

How could so many smart people do something so silly?

Sad, but true, Frank.  That's why people stayed with the absolute monarchy

  Ribbs_OSK right now is MM/1 specific. Do to the fact that, many of the
routines do screen formating, using the old COCO windows commands. These
commands are 99% identical to the KWindow commands on a MM/1.
  The C version will ALSO be MM/1 specific, again du to the KWindow's screen
formating. There is a curses.h and curses.l for OSK. Mabey using this a
gerneric version could be make or if you have a graphics library for the
KIX\30, it could be written to use that library instead of the cgfx.l that
the MM/1 uses.
  That is the way a lot of UNIX code is written. Graphic Screen calls are
done to a common graphic C file. A customized common graphic C file is
made for each type of graphic chip that will be used. This way one only
has to link to the C file for that graphic chip and the make file makes a
program taylored to that chip.

  We have standardized on a format for the project. Thus all beta testers
will be required to use this format. Most of them will not need to do
anything else but read from the disk. Very few will need to make disks with
this format. Only time is at the beginning, when the tester needs to send
in a formatted disk to get the initial beta program.

This is a tactic that really makes sense to me.. I've wondered if we
couldn't maybe come up with some standardized file - maybe a taylored ",l"
file, that would translate the calls for the different systems.

Then if a programmer wished to write a program that would work across
the systems, he could make calls to this function (where each corresponding
function would have a common name, then hand this off to the specific
windowing function.

This would help to streamline programming quite a bit.  I think if this
were done, it should be strictly controlled, where one body - possibly
the OS9 UG - would have complete control over implementation and additions
to the library.

Alternately, no single library might be made, but maybe a common syntax
could be developed, and then a programmer could write his own function,
or library to handle this.

  I think I have the common C module, that is used a lot in UNIX programs.
It is primarly used to interface to CURSORS package. It could be used to
interface to different graphic libraries. What it is is C stubs. Within
the stubs you put the call to the grahic function in your system library.
  Thus once it has be made and the program works, that module could then
be put into public domain, so other programmers could have it to use.

I think something like this would really be beneficial to both the
programmers, in that they could write a graphic program that would have
a wider audience, and to the users alike, as then, they would have access
to any good program that was written, whereas now, without such a package,
if a really good program comes out for one system, the users of the other
systems have to wait till, if ever, someone ports the thing over to their
system.

The only thing we would need to watch out for is to not have each and every
one of us coming up with his own calls.. that would lead to chaos.

I think the report you see is the format that the disk will be formatted
in, and it will have to come from the descriptor, with any modifications
you specify on the command line.

 > Now, if the floppies were SCSI, then it would work.......

Well, if they were SCSI, at least for reads, you wouldn't even have to
worry about anything (if they work like HD's).  At least with the HD's,
the driver doesn't even have to concern itself with tracks, as SCSI
deals with Logical Sector numbers, just Like OS9.  Actually, with SCSI,
you don't have to worry so much about getting your Track #'s and SPT's
correct in your descriptor, just make your TKS*SPT's come out at, or just
under what the HD supports.  If it's too low, you lose a little space, and
if it's too high, you lose a little, too, because you will have a larger
allocation map, where the extra sectors are blocked out.

Where the problem comes from is that with FM type drives, you have to know
how many sectors are in each track, and how many sides, because the driver
has to tell the drive which track, and which sector to go to, where basically
whereto = LSN/(TKS*SPT*SID) (plus the fact that lsn0 might be different
from the rest.

Hmmm, Terry, interesting. May I ask why for the segrigation based on time

how will you determine the "first caller" and "last caller" prizes?

Terry, you still don't seem to get it.

the WEST coast is 2 hours EARLIER, not later.

9 AM Eastern= 8 AM Central=7 AM Mountain =6 AM Pacific

11 AM Eastern=10 AM Central = 9 AM Mountain = 8 AM Pacific

Using the times you posted (TWICE) , your phone is going to start ringing at
8:00 AM and might not ever stop.

  Classified here on Delphi,, aren't all that viable. Most are sold
 but they never get pulled.  Claude Cote,, who left Delphi  a year ago,,

Which version of Unzip are you using.  The latest OS9 v4.5c will work
on all versions of zip files.  This version comes in two modules
unzip and funzip.  Check the database here for the latest version.

Do you reckon it was zipped under a Coco?  You might try it on the coco.
Do you have pcdos for your coco?  if so, you might be able to use it to
read/write PC disks.  If you have a PC and a coco close enough, you could
transfer them via null modem.

Finally, if none of the above, how about (if it will unzip on the coco),
uploading to your workspace here and downloading, or if you have a local
BBS, use it.

     Screen Type
     From: LARRYOLSON   To: MIKEHAALAND (NR)


   Mike,
       I wonder if you could help with a problem that I ran into in trying
   to determine the screen type on an MM/1. Do you know if _gs_styp() was
   implemented ? In the following test program(wintyp), am I using _gs_styp(),
   Get_Pixel_Size(wpath), and Get_num_Colors(wpath) correctly ?

   Talking with Bob van der Poel, he wasn't sure if _gs_styp() was being used.
   He sent me the following:
>I think I have the same problems determining the screen type as you do. I did
>a quick disasm on _gs_styp() and it _appears_ that is doing a I$GetStt with a
>function code of $8d. I don't see this code documented in any of my kwindows
>stuff...so I assume that it was never implemented by KD.

   I ran into this problem in working on Bob's MM2HP.c screen print program.
   The screen print program doesn't get the correct screen info back in order
   to set itself up to print the screen correctly. For an example, I would
   run my Makpal program, which would open a type 3 (320x208) window, then
   run this wintyp program to display the screen info. Then quitting Makpal,
   I would run gifshow on the picture ZOE.gif, and using wintyp on the
   window gifshow created, it would show the identical screen info that I
   got for Makpal. The problem comes in when the screen print program prints
   out these two examples, printing out the zoe.gif works perfectly but
   printing out the Makpal screen results in the program only printing half
   of the screen. I know only half of the Makpal screen is printed, because
   even though its called a 320 wide screen, its actually a 640 wide screen
   with 2 pixels being used for each dot printed on the screen, but how
   can I tell the screen print program to read 320 columns sometimes and
   640 columns other times, when it gets the same screen info for both cases ?

   As a sledge hammer fix for now, I just added a -f option to the program,
   if when you print out the screen you only are printing half of it then
   use the -f option, but there must be a better way.

   Any ideas on what I might be doing wrong ?

91327 8-JAN 14:13  General Information
     Hard drive deals
     From: FHOGG        To: ALL

I got this from my local paper.

"JEM Computers (617-497-2500) has picked up some of Hewlett-Packard's
overstock of new drives. Two amazing bargains are a 330 MB SCSI-2 drive
for $119 and a 670 MB SCSI-2 drive for $299."

These are 5.25" drives.

I pass this information on 'as is'. I have no connection with JEM and I
havn't checked it out. I have no experence with HP drives but they should
work with any of the SCSI computers out there. The article says they will
work with Macs and PCs with a SCSI card. Should work with TC70's, MM1's
Kix's etc.

If you need the space and you can use a 5.25" drive these prices are hard
to beat.

Let me know how it works out if you buy one.
