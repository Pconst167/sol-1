There's a stdfonts module in the BOOTMODS/WIN directory.  Thats's the one
I had left out.  I thought I was loading my fonts from the STartup file
and that the STDFONTS modules in BOOTMODS/WIN was something else.

   Hugo,

   I don't know if this will help you but, I don't have `stdfonts'
in my bootfile, or any fonts in the boot.  I have a script file
in my root called `merge_fonts' that is called from my startup
file.  This is all it is:

   Merge sys/stdfont_01.fnt
   Merge sys/stdfont_02.fnt
   Merge sys/stdfont_03.fnt
   Merge sys/stdfont_04.fnt
   Merge sys/stdpats_16
   Merge sys/stdpats_256
   Merge sys/stdptrs_16
   Merge sys/stdptrs_256
   Merge sys/stdbrshs_16
   Merge sys/stdbrshs_256
   Merge sys/vfonts/cursive.vfont
   Merge sys/vfonts/fancy.vfont
   Merge sys/vfonts/gothic.vfont

   The vfonts stuff is from Mike Haaland's Paint program that I
bought way back when ...

   Hope this helps.

Go to the Internet services section of Delphi, select "FTP". Read up
a little on how to operate it ( I you need to).  Then use FTP to log
onto CHESTNUT.CS.WISC.EDU  If I recall correctly, you then change to
the public directory.  Take a look!

Part of that is the speed of the machine, and part of that is version 1.2,
there were a couple of areas I worked on to speed things up.

They warn you of a possible future surcharge, but I've been using 9600
Tymnet almost exclusively for the last several years, with no additional
charges.

They changed that so called surcharge to NO charge not long ago!
if you have Sprintnet in your area you zippp at 14.4k baud  rather than the
OLD 9600 mode on tymnet<grin>...Sprint uses Fibre optics for their lines,I

I live in So. Central KY.. I've found that I can call within my dialing
LATA cheaper than anywhere else.. I'd been calling out-of-state for a long
time, thinking out-of-state calls were the cheapest.. Here, at least,
the most expensive calls are in-state if your long distance carrier
handles them.. Next is out-of-state calls, but the in-LATA calls are
close to half the cost.  Still not cheap enough to do a whole lot of
on-line browsing, but every little bit helps, I suppose.

Well, of course _most_ of the speed increase definitely is due to the
machine..  When the coco got over about 75 msgs, it got to taking a
pretty appreciable time.. Now, with OSK, with my msg base building up..
(can't see now what the size is, probably about 75), but it seems more
like a little stumble <G>.

Thanks.. I've already gone and put a 9600 node in for my NetWork1.  That
really makes a difference.  After getting used to the faster rate,
9600 and 14.4,  2400 seems incredibly slow.. It was just a few years ago
that we thought we were in Turbo with that speed <G>

Well...the major hit is when you decide "yeah, I think I'll add that
SIG to my list" and get a WHOLE LOT of messages.  When I got on CF 63,
there were 12K messages; that will show up a slower-than-O(n) algorithm
pretty quickly. :-)  Aside from pathological cases like that, though,
I've never had any speed problems with ix on my MM/1.

I knew you lived in Louisville but had forgotten.. I live in Russell Springs,
in Russell Co.  Lake Cumberland is on the southern border of the Co.

I attend some hamfests, don't have a radio, but go with some friends to
see the computer stuff.

I'll probably go to the one in Cave City.  Have you ever gone to that one
(in Mar I think) (might be the one you are speaking about).  If we
both go, maybe we can meet up there.

Right (what I was referring to was the speed of accessing the message file
when you go to read - I guess you were, too..)  yes, the speed is pretty
fantastic.. As I mentioned, with a small base, it doesn't even seem to
take time.. Once or twice, when it changed forums, I didn't even realize
it _had_ changed, but on the coco, you knew it each time <G>.  With
a larger base, all I've noticed was only a very tiny pause while processing
them.  Of course, I'm sure it's a good idea to zap non-useful files,
especially the "OK, I'll do that" ones.  As a matter of fact, I've had
ix/OSK for a couple weeks now, and haven't even reorg'ed them yet, haven't
really needed to, but will probably soon.. might help keep disk fragmentation
down.

Yeah, I'll probably go to the Cave City hamfest this year. Right now I'm
waiting for my tax return to arrive in the mail so I can purchase an HF rig.
I doubt it'll be here by the Cave City hamfest, but I want to go anyway to
get an idea of what's available in the used market. I went last year and had
a pretty good time. I also usually go to the Elizabethtown, Frankfort and
Louisville hamfests as well. By the way, the Louisville hamfest will be at
the Kentucky Fair and Expo Center this year (October 14 and 15 I think).

My friends have been hard after me to do so, but I don't know when I'd
find time to fool with it if I got into it.. This computer dominates my
time (G), but maybe..

I think I'd prefer to go ahead and get the code license..  I think many of
the hams kinda look down upon the no-coders.  I've also been told that
communicating in code is one of the finer aspects of the thing.

Believe me, whenever I use the computer, I'm grateful for having taken
typing in high school.  <enter politically incorrect mode>  Besides,

     Yea, like Delphi's built-in diary program. :) Zend was never meant to
be used by anyone but Delphi's Service Staff but I assume most users know
about it now. Delphi has alot of nice stuff, sometimes I forget what a
scramble freak I used to be. Or how I used to hang out in main conf. all
the time. Now mostly IX sees more online time than I do. :) (I can never
seem to catch those conferances)

Dig,

The title of the book is Delphi, The Official Guide by Michael A. Banks.  The
publisher is General Videotex Corporation.  My issue has a 1990 copyright
notice, but perhaps there is a new revision.  It is available through your
library as ISBN # 0-9625623-0-0. <grin>

     I took Home Ec. in middle school: sewing, cooking, etc. and then in
HS (mostly cooking and nutrition, boy did she get me scared about bacteria).
I enjoyed Home Ec. but REALLY HATED typing. We learned on typewrighters and
the chackchackchackchack CH-ZING! CH-ZING! going on in the room made it hard
to concentrate. I couldn't use home row and type fast. I flunked it but
pleaded with my teacher that I needed a C to go on to office systems and she
let me go on. Mostly I cheated my way through office systems too (thanks Joel)
:).

     If my mom would have let me use the oven I might actually know how to
cook today! <g>

Seriously, you are most correct.. Typing now, for almost anyone, is, if
not a necessity, definitely an asset.  I'm by no means a good typist, but
if I had no concept of the basics, would have a much harder time at the
keyboard.  I also appreciate what ability in this I do have.

It may not be a necessity for all jobs, but it is a necessity for many of
them. Lots of job advertisements quote requirements along the lines of
experience with WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Word for Windows, accounting
packages, etc. And that ultimately means typing perience. And these aren't
just "secretarial" jobs either. As I said before, taking a year of typing was
definitely one of the best decisions I've made. I think I was typing at
roughly 30 or so wpm and have progressed to 60 wpm and better over the years.
It seems to depend on my mood and the typing tutor I'm using. Most of the
time I seem to be at about 60 wpm but have hit peeks of 80 to 90 wpm. Grrr,
I still have problems with the numbers though.

you learn by necessity. Being a single bachelor all these years, I used to

I've learned to eat lots of left-overs. I make a pot of chili or spaghetti
or whatever and typically eat it for a week. On the other hand, that means
I have to cook once a week and it cuts down on washing dishes. I have yet
to try my hand at anything "fancy." My chili, for example, consists of 2.5
pounds of ground beef, two cans of diced tomatos, two cans of chili or kidney
beans, and two packages of chili mix.Brown ground beef, throw in pot, mix,
heat, serve. I can even do it with one hand tied behind my back or talking
on the phone. :-)

Wow.  I have been cooking for years, and, now, I cook meals just slightly
below professional chef quality and cuisine.  Nothing is too difficult or
daunting for me to prepare.  You must be very slim, Greg.  How do you
stimulate your appetite if you eat such bland, boring food?

I have never regretted taking typing..  60 wpm sounds really good to me.

Don't know what I can do now.. I got a typing tutor or test for the coco once,
I think at that time, I was around 30.. at the time, it had been some time
since I had tried to type much.  I might be better now.  Whatever it is, I
suppose it is sufficient, although faster couldn't have hurt <G>

You can say that again.. I'm single, too, and I know what it's like to eat
at the above eating establishments continuously.. OTOH, seems like when I
try to cook, I can mess up more pots and stuff.. :-(

My cooking is not all that fancy, either.. I do a lot of Hamburger Helper,
etc..  I use the Crock Pot a bunch, too.. Hard to work and come in and
prepare a meal.  I've not been trying to cook for too long, but I'm learning
a few new dishes as I go along.

For chili, I just uses Pintos, they seem to work pretty well..  I usually
use browned hamburger, about a pound, about a pound of beans, chili powder,
a dash of cayenne pepper, sometimes a little garlic, and add a some tomato
Sauce.  Goes pretty good, especially in cold weather.  I never did care for
spagetti or macaroni in the chili.. some use it (don't remember if you
mentioned this or not).

I tell you a little quickie thing you might try sometime if you like the
ingredients.. Heat a can of mushrooms.. I usually use Cream of Mushroom
soup.. Take some toast, put a layer of Tuna, then another slice of toast,
you can stack on as many layers as you wish.. On top, and on lower layers,
if you wish, pour the Mushroom soup.  To me, it makes a pretty good meal,
especially for supper.

Why don't you get a typing book and learn on your own?  Well, actually,
you could learn without the book, I suppose.  Either way, it's just a
matter of practicing.  Really, all you need to know is to use the
A-S-D-F keys as the reference point for your left hand, and the J-K-L-;
keys for the right hand, and learn to go from there.  As a matter of fact,
there are typing tutors for the CoCo (you still use one, don't you?).  I
downloaded one from somewhere.  I'd work on it if I were you and wanted
to learn.

I don't put spaghetti or pasta on my chili, although I have eaten it that

Dennis,

Twelve year olds can be tough, but I taught mine.  I had twin boys.  They are
now 28 (Gad!) and they have an appreciation for good food that I had some part
in cultivating.  I still cook a lot.  I find it creative and very satisfying.
I lean toward spicy, complex flavors and winey sauces.  Lots of baking and
roasting. Hmmm.  Whets my appetite. <grin>

Oh, David,

Arggggggghhhhh!  (Stomach turning).  Actually, the chili ain't bad and the
crockpot is an excellent move, but HH and that tuna and mushroom soup
thing--whoa!  Most canned, bagged, fast commercial food is loaded with either
fat, salt and sugar or all three.  Americans pay dearly for eating like that
down the road with hypertension and heart problems.  Ty to eat fresh foods
with plenty of fruits and veggies or, later your body will begin to break
down.  You truly ARE what you eat.

Good luck.

Lots of luck, Paul.  Your corpse will be preserved well, but you'll die early,
not to mention aging more quickly too.  If you do not give your body the
nutrients it needs, it slowly shrivels, breaks down and, finally, quits no
matter how clever you are.

I dunno, I seem to prefer my chili "in the raw" <G>  These additions just
don't seem to add anything, IMO.

Lotsa people don't like mushrooms.. I don't suppose I'm extremely crazy
about them, but I do kinda like them, I suppose.

Have you ever seen any "dry land fish" ?  This is a mushroom that comes up

Soldering in a ROM in no way implies the unit is a "cheeeepo".
It means that Western Digital was confident of the workings of that
final revision of the ROM software, and decided to dispense with the
addeded expense and added UNRELIABILITY that use of a socket entails.

     THANKS
     From: MRUPGRADE    To: GREGL

  Hi Greg
  I was talking with LT Day (OH) a while back, and he remarked it was
Greg Law who first recomended him to The UPGRADE.   This was a coupla
years ago,, and you may not remember.  But I'd like to extend a big
thank you.  For not only recommending us,, but recognizing our support
of OS-9.  (LT's prime interest)   I continually say, "we support OS-9"
(as well as RSDOS), but for reasons unknown to me, it seldom gets
heard?   A dealer who subscribed recently remarked, "I'm really
surprised at the amount of OS-9 support you offer".
  Why he was surprised,,, beats me.  I'm just glad some are looking
beyond our RSODS only stereotype, to learn the truth.  I've been
kicking the bushes for some time trying to get up more support,, and
am glad to say,, we added still more OS support!
  Our February issue will carry two new OS-9 authors.  New to the
UPGRADE but not at all, as respected OS'ers.
  Hey,, thanks Greg,,,

  Now all I hafta worry about is: we may give off the image of
                                  (smile) an OS only group.
  Not to worry,,, we here to support the CoCo Community.

>your buffer's horizontal size to multiples of 2.....

Well.......here's whats occuring so far.
The xsize of the get buffer was 1 and changed to 2 but still doesn't solve
my problem. I'll explain exactly what parameters are- may be you or someone
could see the err of my ways...

GET/PUT BUFFER:
xcor=adjustable to any x (0-319)
ycor=0
xsize=2 (REM:tried 1 also)
ysize=191
buffsize=384 (tried 192)

REM: what I'm trying to do is GET one verticle pixel column -converted into
it's respective palette registers.
NOW: I'm PEEKing starting at the buffers address,converting that number to bin
y, then taking the left four bits of that byte to convert to pal.reg..
This arrangement works perfectly for even number only! The question is how
do I do this for the odd numbered (x's)?  There's got to be something about
the layout I don't understand.

Any sugestions???

Seems like it sould but it doesn't now?
What I did was to make a program that you could pass the x-cor and the
choice of either left four bits or right four bits.
Now- if you place a point on the screen in question- and its on an even
numbered x-cor...both left and right halfs of the byte show the change.
On odd numbered lines, any change doesn't show up.(Also- if you change a
point on even numbered line- there is a change in the GET data towards the
end of the next odd line- both sampling left and right half bytes).
I obviously don't have a complete grasp of the situation yet. Sure seems
like some type of timing problem but so far changing to a different
PEEK sampling rate of two didn't solve anything for the odd lines.

Do you know if the screen data starts at the GET buffer address or is
there a leading header there? (read somewhere GET buffers need 30 bytes
for overhead). May be I was just lucky to get the proper data back for
half of what I was looking for?

Guess what? (I feel so stupid!) I finally foun the culprit!
My problem was a timing error of sorts. It seems that I left out this simple
line in my program (bnum=hnum) which gets the results from the passed
parameter choice left/right of byte. The program was always sampling the
left half byte no matter what you mode you choose.

There-for...the right half byte indeed reflects the odd lines afterall!!!

OK.. A GET must start at the begin of a byte.  IOW.. for a 16-color screen,
a byte represents 2 pixels, and these are 2 _HORIZONTAL_ pixels.  Also,
you should make your horizontal size on a multiple of 2.. it will be
bumped up to this when you "GET" anyway..  If you only want one horizontal
pixel, your xsiz should be 2.. If you want an even pixel, use the least
significant 4 bits (backward?).  An odd pixel: the MS-4 bits.  You'll
have to discard the other half of the byte if you only want 1 horiz. pix.

Try this..  The thing to remember that GET (or PUT) will not split a
horizontal byte, and it won't even if you try to define it otherwise.

Yes, it seems to me that you cannot define a buffer 320 (or 640) pixels
wide, however, If I remember correctly, it will go ahead and get the full
byte.  You may have to make sure you're defining a large enough buffer to
hold it all..  Been a long time since I played around with them.

     shells input buffer size
     From: WDTV5        To: ALL

Has anyone else been bitten by the rather limited size of shells input buffer?
I tried to make a makefile for my "pf" over the last few days so I could do a
piecemeal compile. Worked great till it got to the rlink stage, then bombed
out because shell clipped the last 4 names and all the options off the command
line cc passed to rlink. The fix was to merge a bunch of the smaller source
files to reduce the number of filenames passed to the linker, that works ok.
But the 64k ? is why should I have to. With all the work thats been done to
shell over the last 10 years, I don't see any excuse for that less than 240
character limit to the command line to have survived this long. Has any one
worked out the patches to fix that, and if so, where can I find them?

Cheers, Gene Heskett

     CD-i 602 abilities?
     From: DIGIGRADE    To: JEJONES



      Hi James,

    You seem to be in the know about these things so I'll ask you...

    I just got a super deal on a CD-i 602 system. There are some problems
though. I can't get the service shell opened. Joel and I just finished doing
every kind of combination of hookups with the back port (mini-din) and the
two RS232 ports (DB-9). We tried direct connect, null modem, everything. We
even held down the spacebar on the MM/1 like you said to do for the 220. No
go. I think we are doing something wrong. We were using Tascom (allthough
I figured Sterm would have been better, but we weren't shure)

    I really would like to get the player to recognize the floppy drive as a
boot device. Is the 602 ready to accept my SCSI hard drive as a boot device?

I really like the caddy system. I need more caddies though. :)

    If there is anything else you can tell me about this system's capability,
particularly opening a user shell, I would really appreciate it (gotta have
something to show off at the FEST!). Also, is getting a CD-i keyboard going
to help me?



      Thanks a GIG!

I don't recall giving that advice--perhaps you're thinking of Boisy.  (And
with any luck he or someone else will respond, because I'm afraid I don't

     OSK Basic
     From: VAXELF       To: ALL

  I and some others are porting the Ribbs_OS9 to Ribbs_OSK. Progress is
coming along great. Starting to test the FIDO mail code now. Also have
a beta site online in southern Cal.
  Question, we have noticed that we can take the same basic source module
load it into Basic, pack it, switch to another window, do a Ident on the
packed module, record the CRC, go back to the other window, kill basic,
run basic again, reload the same module, pack it again, but this time the
CRC will be different. I have repacked the same module 4 times in a row
and got 4 different CRC's.
  Can anyone shead some lite on why the CRC comes out different???? This
is causing a problem, since it makes it hard to determine which is the
newest module, so that we don't end up with a mix of old and new modules.
  Never had this problem with Basic09 under OS9 LII.

That *might* be happening because something is being padded for alignment
(code or initialized data), and no attention is being paid to what value
is put in the padding.  (Padding is necessary on the 68xxx because some
of the processor family insists, for example, that two-byte and four-byte
integers have even addresses.)

I've noticed the same thing.. I _THINK_ what it is.. is that the variables
are sometimes shuffled around..  That is.. if you load a module (source)
and edit it, then the data is in some specific order, due to the original
load..  and the order is not changed in that instance.. However, if you
load this changed module, then Basic may load them in a different arrangement
so will therefore be saved differently than the previous save, even if you
don't  edit it this time..  This is only a guess, but it's the best I've
ever been able to come up with.

James mentions padding in his reply.. I've discovered this with OSK, but
I've never seen any evidence of padding with the 6809, but it could be,
and BASIC might do some padding in anticipation of OSK, dunno..

But I know what you mean about the different CRC's messing you up..  I've

 Hmm, this must depend alot on things like MB design etc. I'm running Warp on
a 486sx/33 with 8 megs, and although I'm sure that 16+ megs would speed
things up, it's far from slow. I've also ran a BBS on a 386sx/20 with only 4
megs using a native OS/2 BBS package and it ran fairly smooth for such an
obsolete machine.

 I guess some machines just work better than others regardless of memory. I
would venture to say that MB design plays a big role in the performance of
OS/2 Warp. I have 2 Tandy (no cracks please) machines that Warp works GREAT
on.

     Internet stuff
     From: MRGOOD       To: ALL

Ok, I have a question about Internet related software.  I've heard
it from two different sources lately that UUCP is an outdated way
of getting email and usenet news.

One source is FDU, which is dropping my UUCP account.  The other is a book
on the Internet.

My question is, without a UUCP package, how else can a person receive
email and news at home, automatically as I do now with UUCPbb?  Other than
opening an account with an Internet Service Provider and logging in as I
do now with Delphi, I'm not aware of any other way.

The "preferred" method is to use a SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol)
or PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol). These are basically two similar ways of
running TCP/IP protocols directly over a serial line with a high-speed
modem. I'm currently using a SLIP account with the Trumpet WinSock package
for Microsoft Windows and, as far as the applications are concerned, it looks
just like  have a network connection. The difference, of course, is that
I'm using a 14.4Kbps modem instead of Ethernet/Token Ring network boards and
a T1/T3 line.

I have to agree that UUCP is an out-dated way of connecting to the Internet,
but UUCP is more widely available at present than is SLIP/PPP packages. UUCP
lets you transfer mail, news groups, and files whereas SLIP/PPP lets you do
practically everything you can do from a computer directly on Internet --
including gopher, world wide web (with graphical browsers like Mosaic and
NetScape), FTP, etc.

Hmm... yeah.  I showed Hugo's message to a friend who uses UUCP, and
his response was something like:  "Sure.  The Internet service providers
want you to use all the interactive and GUI stuff supported by SLIP/PPP,
rather than just quickly transferring the data and reading it offline.
They're charging partly based upon online time."  If you are using
UUCP, then you aren't tempted to spend additional time doing other
things.

He's quite happy with the facilities he gets through UUCP.

I assume that for SLIP/PPP you need to log into a service, right?  Which
means you spend online time.  That's different from having UUCP
download what you want so you can peruse email and news offline.

     monitor
     From: AJMLFCO      To: ALL

I just spotted a sidebar in a new magazine, "Multimedia Producer".
They mention the difficulty of finding monitors that will sync down
at the rates used by TV, approx. 15kHz.  A company called CD Solutions
is making a .28 dot pitch monitor, model CD-1401, which covers 15 to 35
Khz horizontal and 50 to 90 Hz. vertical rates.  It displays NTSC, RGB
analog, PAL, and VGA up to 800x600.  List price is $549 ( of course,
nobody pays list).  If you are having trouble finding a good monitor
for your CoCo, MM/1, or PC that also display NTSC from your VCR, this
might be of interest to you.  As a note, I have _nothing_ to do with
this company, I just noticed it while reading the magazine.  The number,
if you are interested, is 510-820-5400.  I would assume they don't have
a *clue* what a CoCo or MM/1 is.

Marty, I've noted several companies (see micronotes in last issue) selling
refurbished Multisync 1 & 2 models for around $175. Some of these have new
CRTs in them as well (actually one company said MOST did), which I guess
accounts for most of the cost.

Frank,
Some people buy a new car and a couple of years later, they
have a used car.  But it's not all that bad because it's  not
too out of date and worn out.  Now others, buy a used car to begin with.
After a couple of years, it's really worn out and really out

OK too, because the oner saved a lot of money.  What's this have to
do with monitors?  A little, I think.  Personally, I like to have

Your version of how Microsoft got into the DOS business is rather

you can't even remember the name of the company what created
the first major operating system for microcoputers (CPM).

The version of the legend I heard was that IBM contracted with
Microsoft to write the BASIC for their new machine.
This because Microsoft had made a name for itself writing BASICs.

They then sent representatives to Digital Research, whose founder
Gary Kildall had developed CPM, THE operating system for the most
common desktop computers of the time, to ask DR to develop
an operating system for the IBM computer.  These folks arrived
when Gary was out on a short vacation.   They told the company
to contact Gary directly.   Gary replied that he was on his own
time, and IBM could just wait until he was back at work.

IBM said "We're IBM.  When say "frog", you jump.   Gary invited
them to perform an act of intimacy with themselves.

So IBM left Digital Research, and went to Microsoft, and said
"We want you to develop the OPERATING SYSTEM for our new machine, too."
Gates said "We make BASICs, not operating systems.   Why don't you
go to Digital Research, their specialty is operating systems?"
IBM said "We want YOU to make the operating system for our computer."
Gates said "But we've NEVER made an operating system.  I don't think
we can do it in the time frame you ask."   IBM said "If you don't
make us an operating system, we'll take away the contract for the
BASIC."    Gates said "Operating systems!  Oh!  OPERATING systems!
Why didn't you say so more clearly.   OF COURSE!  We LOVE making
operating systems.  Do it in our sleep.  Yessir!  We'll make
you an operating system."


Now there was at this time a company called Seattle Computer
in Seattle that was working on a project for an 8088 based machine.
They got as far as they could, but needed CPM 88 (which was to be
the operating system for the 8088).   They called Digital and said
"When's CPM 88 going to be ready?" and Digital Research said
"We're working on it."    So they hired a programmer to write
the bare bones of an operating system that was designed to be
as closely as possible LIKE what they EXPECTED CPM 88 to be,
based on the original CPM.   For they needed
an operating system to further their project.   Time and again
they asked DR about when CPM 88 would be ready, and they
heard again and again "We're working on it."   Eventually,
their "bare bones' system, which they called Q-dos (for quick
and dirty DOS) got more an more elaborate.

Gates at Microsoft got wind of this, and asked to license use of Q DOS
for his own purposes.  Later, he hired away the programmer who
started the Q DOS project.   Thus MS DOS 1.0 was born.
Gates paid a few tens of thousands for the rights to Q DOS.


Some years later, Seattle Computer, feeling it had been had, sued
Microsoft.  Or rather, they noted in their contract with Microsoft
that it appeared from the wording that they should have rights
to sell without royalty ANY PRODUCT THAT WAS A DERIVATIVE OF Q DOS,
meaning they could sell any version of MS DOS without paying
Microsoft a royalty.


Microsoft ended up BUYING Seattle Computer, then SELLING BACK
to Seattle Computer all of the company EXCEPT any real or imagined
rights to MS DOS.

Its awful to get so absent-minded, but I can't recall who was relaying
my messages to/from Gene Krenciglawa about a year or so back. Can anyone
help out with a relay to his school/busines/home email box? I have some
email I'd like to send him.

Thanks, Gene Heskett, WDTV5@delphi.com

     Feb 95 *CDi* magazine
     From: JEJONES      To: ALL

Hot <expletive>!  I got the February 1995 issue of *CDi* magazine in the mail
today.  I'm very glad, for two reasons:

1. Previous issues said "Sept/Oct" and "Nov/Dec"; could they be going
   monthly?

2. I got the February issue...in February!  Previous issues were, um,
   rather less prompt.

A quick scan of the contents shows (not a complete list):

- previews of *Rise of the Robots*, *Merlin's Apprentice*, *Secret Mission*,
  and *Discworld*

- an article on *Chaos Control*, which looks pretty impressive.

- reviews of a bunch o' Video CD movies--suffice it to say that if you
  feel like you're in some kind of...*spy* movie, you'll be happy.

- articles on two Monty Python Video CDs...no, wait, there's--but that
  would be giving it away.

- a list of 202 available titles, and I'm pretty sure I've seen some
  messages on the net listing some that they don't have, so I think
  there are more than that really.

There's quite a bit of news on CDi at CES that I've not seen mentioned
elsewhere, too.

I've seen *CDi* on the stands at a Hastings book store in Norman OK,
and other people have mentioned seeing it in stores.  IMHO it's worth
tracking down.

No, they're not...I should've looked closer.  Just inside it says "published
bimonthly" in moderately-large friendly letters.

Hi James,

Hope my issue of CD-i Magazine is in the mail.  I'm currently in St. Louis,
waiting to catch the plane home as I type.  When I was in Syracuse last
week, I saw CD-i Magazine on the shelves in Borders Books there.

While I was in Dallas this week, I went to "Incredible Universe," a
fantastic place filled with all sorts of electronics.  I've never seen
anything like it!  It's like Best Buy to the power of 3.

Anyway, they had the absolute *BEST* CD-i display I have ever seen!  There were
more titles available at the store than you could shake a stick at, and there
ws was a very promising demo of several upcoming CD-i titles including
Chaos Control, Kathy Smith's work out, Microcosm, and others.

It looks like CD-i is doing quite well there.

L8r.

     PUPPO XT keyboard interf.
     From: MRUPGRADE    To: DSRTFOX (NR)

  I was typing up the PUPPO interface review for next months UPGRADE Mag this
 morning.   And had oto notice "all the features".   Or it appears
 many see it as mainly just giving you a "flashy keyboard" on your CoCo.
 Which it does,, but that's just a beginning.  In reality it is very well pu
 together (except for that %&**#$ menu),, adding many features.  no matter
 which RS or OS DOS you use.  The Function keys F-1 thru F-10 will work
 and be vaulable within many Commericial programs.  Tw-128 & ULTIMATERM,,etc.
 My extra is in this month's FOR SALE colupmn in theh UPGRADE.  The review
 in next months Mag.  Kinda backwarpds,, but,,, oh , well...
  BTW: one thing lacking,,,,    a <g> sppell checker

     Basic I-code CRC Problem
     From: VAXELF       To: ALL

  I think I have found why the CRC of a packed Basic Module (I-Code) comes
up with a different CRC each time I pack the same unaltered Basic module.
After packing and saving the same module four times, I did a "cmp" on
them. Each time ONLY the bytes between OFFSET $20-$2F were different.
  The Manual shows $20-$2D are RESERVED. $2E-$3F is M$Parity - Header Parity
Check btyes.
  The only thing I can come up with is Basic is NOT zeroing $20-$2D, thus
the garbage in those bytes are causing the CRC to be different.

  Question - Is there any way thru Basic to set the Version Number of the
Module. If I can set the Revision ID byte when Basic Packs the module, I
can use that as a indicator of which module is the newest.

I know of no way through BASIC, but OTOH there's always fixmod.
