Does anyone have pt68k4 in which you use the Alt-86 with PROCOMM if so can you
tell me how to set it up? Tom Farrow (DENVER CO)

Tom,

I've got a PT68K-4 that had an ALT86 in it until the ALT86 went intermittent.
The ALT86 looks like an XT to MS-DOS software.  Although I didn't spring for a
copy of PROCOMM, there's no reason why it shouldn't work (unless you bought the
Windows version by mistake).

When I hook up the modem line I get almost all the lights on or none at all. I
might need to get some help getting the I.O. port set up . The only real reason
that I need to do this is because my work place doesn't have a real good system
when it comes to OS9. I followed the instructions on the card , but to no
avail. Thanks Tom Farrow

Tom,

You are trying to set up a System 4?  Are you using the built-in ports or a
serial card.

If you are using the built-in ports, they are not set up for modem connections.
The wires going to the 25-pin connector are switched so that they can be
connected to a terminal, or possibly another computer.  I have a System 5, and
made up some more connectors from scratch, but you should be able to switch the
pins (push them out from the front side and reinsert them.  If you'll look
closely, the 25-pin connector will have some little numbers by the pin holes.
Here's the connection I got.  Note: I'm giving these #'s as the WIRE NUMBERS on
the FLAT CABLE.  NOT the connector numbers that plug into the Motherboard.  By
"connector" I mean the 25-pin connector you plug your modem cable into.

   #1 DCD (This should have a little paint along its length to let you know
          it is #1)  should go to pin 8 on the connector, but I don't think
          it was connected originally
   #2  <no connection>
   #3  RX pin 3
   #4  RTS pin 4
   #5  TX  pin 2
   #6  CTS pin 6
   #7  DTR pin 20  (Uhhh... maybe it was _this_ one that was not connected,
              and not DCD)...
   #9  Gnd pin 7
   #10  <no connection>

If you're trying to install a serial card, you cannot directly install one in
the computer. I think it has to have a minor modification done to it to make it
work.  I know the internal modem does.  If you want to use a card, I suggest
getting one from Delmar.  They will make the modification for you _AND_
warranty it.

Kevin,

Thanks for the info.  I checked out Multimedia Forum (again!) and found someone
who had mentioned DYUV in a message.  Wish me luck!

The box we're using is for Bell Atlantic's interactive video trial.  It uses
the CD-I chipset for graphics display.  If you're interested in a vendor name,
try Adaptive Microware in Ft. Wayne(?), IN.  Unfortunately, I don't have the
number handy, but you should probably be able to locate them without much
trouble.  If you can't find them under this name, try Stellar One.

Why not just use dsave to copy the disk file by file. When it craps out, you'll

Dsave did the trick.  I'd never used dsave before so it was a good learning
process.  Turns out there were 3 files which could have been the culprit.  On
each of them dsave crashed with a 248 error, media full.  Dir e showed that
somehow the file length report was corrupt indicating something like $8 eb5d.
After deleting the suspect files, dsave completed the process.  Before and
after the deletions, free /dd  indicated the same amount tho.   thx,  -ph-

Paul,

I worked on a system where file sizes larger than the media were reported.  It
was a situation where the system was crashing while a database was being
accessed.  The file headers were corrupted in the process.  Just deleting the
bad files did not completly heal the file system.  You may want to do some more
sanity checks on your files before you trust the drives file structure.

There is no point in going to the trouble converting to single-sided 80 track;
I'm just as happy to keep using the CoCo where it is appropriate to do so.

Yes, I do have the demo version of OS9MAX; the real one might do but the demo
version is not much use.

Oh, the reason for transferring files? I have a lot of stuff in text,
spreadsheet, database etc. form that will be exchanged between the two. For
example, the PC has much nicer database entry than the CoCo, but won't run the
specialized report generator I wrote for OS9. I expect to transfer stuff back
and forth for some time to come.

     As far as I know, there isn't any legal way to get the screen information
   in Basic09. Depending on what the program does, you can get the info in
   a round about way. If you are using a 80x24 screen, setup an array
   Scrn(80,24), and whenever you write to the screen you also write to the
   array. Then to check for a particular character at a certain location,
   you would just look in the array.
        The array could be Scrn(80,24):STRING[1] or Scrn(80,24):INTEGER
     depending on if you want to work with character strings or character
     values.

   Not knowing what you are trying to do, I can't say how much the program
would be slowed down, but I don't believe it would even be noticeable.

   When you do a print to the screen, are you doing something like this:

   RUN gfx2("curxy", 20,10)
   Print "X";

   How much time would you lose by doing this:

   RUN gfx2("curxy", 20,10)
   Print "X";
   ScreenArray(20,10) = 88      REM 88 = decimal ascii X

   Then to check for a character at a particular screen location just look
   in the ScreenArray at that x,y.

       There was another way of getting screen info legally, but I'm not
   up on exactly how its done, it involves using the GET function to get
   a portion of the screen, and then looking in the GET buffer.

If you want to know what is in a certain location on the screen you'll have to
remember what you put there <g>. Since OS9 is designed to be run on a
terminal...and terminals usually don't tell. Easy enuf to set up an array to
duplicate the screen (dim screen(80,24):byte) and then just copy the values
into the array as you "print" them onto the screen.

Gee-whizzz.... As I was telling Larry Olson, I had thought about storing the
text lines in an array, but with a corresponding loss of speed.... Is there a
way to do it in assembly language?. I do not know if the text screens of (text)
windows share the same hardware RAM locations, if so, then it would be a matter
of PEEKing in RAM, but as I said, there's some information lacking 'bout the
video RAM....

One never knows till you try...but I'd be willing to bet a cup of coffee (ya
gotta come to my place to collect <g>) that it'd be faster to store the status
of the characters, etc. in a byte array and then to check that for further
action than it would be to use PEEKs to check the actual screen data. Probably
not a bad method to use in any event since if you are using graphic-type
screens you will not have any choice at all. Give it a try...if it is too slow
you can always recode parts into assemebler--but if you are using a text screen
I'm sure that any slowdowns will come from other areas besides this.

Hi David!

Geeze .... back to 1992 eh?

Leseee .... reviewing the init module of my current os9boot with moded I see
that the IRQstack size parameter reported is 1024. I believe I did indeed bump
that up from a previously reported 512.

I do believe we're speaking in "word size" here so in bytes, that would be
4096.

Long word is what my moded reports..  Mine was 256 (words)..  I bumped mine up
to 512 last night, might go on up.

David,

Microware sets the IRQ stack size intentionally low to get good minimum memory
numbers for marketing.  If your system has a significant amount of IRQ activity
(such as serial I/O), this number should be increased generously.  I was
working with a system that had 32 high speed intelligent serial ports, upto 28
more conventional serial ports, and lots of hard disk activity.  I think we
increased the IRQ stack to 32k long words.  OS-9 does not always report IRQ
stack problems gracefully, so increasing the IRQ stack is a good thing to try
if you can't figure out strange behavior in a complex system.
