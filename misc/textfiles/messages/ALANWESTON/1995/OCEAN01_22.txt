David,
        That news about development of OS-9 for the visually impaired 
is really exciting. Would there be any objection to posting the 
addresses and info on the company that's doing the development (without 
of course, doing any "solicitation" in the echo)?

Clyde,
    Certainly you can post anykind of info. Main thing is posting
commercial adds and pricing that is frowned on.  However announcements
of any new software/hardware related to the MM/1 is welcomed. Just so
long as prices are not quoted.  It is up to the vendor to contact the
potential customer or the customer to contact vendor direct.
    Personal forsale and wanted msgs are permitted as long as a seller
at least includes an asking price and his tel. number.

Subject : Moving to a minitower case
Date    : 95/01/05 18:17:16

Recent experience (moving to a new hard drive) tells me that life would
be a lot easier with a tower/minitower case, so that even a klutz such
as myself could insert/remove devices with minimal disturbance to the
other stuff in the case.  So...once I add up how many of how big devices 
I expect to end up with, and measure the slot in the desk that's
intended to hold such cases, I'm going to order one.
 
Here's the thing: I also plan to set up to run UUCP here shortly, and
once I do that, it means that to be a good boy I need to have my system
up reliably at night to keep batched news and mail from accumulating on
the site nice enough to feed me.  (Hmmm...perhaps "audrey2" would be a
good name... :-)  So, the plan is to get everything prepared, holes
drilled and all, so that the actual move can take place in a jiffy and
the nighttime scheduled uucicos can occur undisturbed.
 
So...any advice on how to do this would be welcome.  Of particular use
would be the info on the spacing of holes for the standoff insulators
that support the boards, the spacing between the boards, any stuff I
need to look out for in buying a case, will I need to snarf ribbon cable 
and connectors to extend paddleboard cables, how to extend non
paddleboard connectors.  (Am I overlooking anything? :-)
 
Thanks!

Subject : RiBBS_OSK beta release
Date    : 95/01/06 12:00:34


    For all those that have expressed an interest in getting the
RiBBS_OSK beta disk, it is ready !.

    To get this BBS software just send me a 3.5" floppy, preferably
formatted for 5920 sectors (dmode sct=37, t0s=37). In a returnable
mailer with return postage included (I am retired and have limited
income).  It is currently working on the MM/1 w/3 meg mem. 68070 CPU
and Kwindows specific.  Current testing is with the windio53 but also
works with windio52.

     John A Donaldson is the programmer and Randy Wilson is doing the
assem. parts.  Calvin Dodge and myself are the only beta sysops so far.

     Future plans are for converting to C and it will become a commercial
package by Blackhawk Enterprises.  It should also be able to incorporate
the latest Fido compatable mailers when converted to C.  Additionally
it will be able to incorporate a shell out to the UUCP login which is
currently working on the MM/1 (using it now).

     'RiBBS to Go' for the CoCo OS9 is also available from me. If interested
send me E-Mail.

    Warren Hrach, RiBBS/RiBBS_OSK beta sysop.

David,
  Yes, you have the program so far. I have been spending all my time
on that screen print program, and havn't done anything more with the
Battleship game. Now that I have the screen print working, I'll get
back on Battleship. Any ideas on things you would like to see in the
program ?  I would really like to add sound effects to it, but I will
have to search around for some battle sounds already recorded, I have
some sound effect cd's, but I wasn't getting clean, noise free copies
when trying to record them on my MM/1.
 Larry

To add :  Clyde - I never received the original message here - just 
Warren's reply, so it seems apparent we have another FidoFault  in action.
The company responsible for the development is BlackHawk Enterprises, Inc.
We are working in conjuction with the Computer Science Department of 
Oklahoma State University in Stillwater Oklahoma.  Dr. Blayne Mayfield is
the department head.  You may diseminate this information where and when 
you please, and I am looking for other investors.   

Thanks!

David,
        I'm replying again to this message about developing OS-9 for 
physically challenged people. OS-9 developers along this line should 
take a look at the group of programs in the DOS world called AccessDOS, 
which include very useful utilities for people with hearing or movement 
impairments. Included in this package are all three Dvorak keyboard 
templates, left-handed, right-handed and two-handed, to be used with 
the MS-DOS KEYB.COM .  
  
        <begging and pleading mode on>
  
        PLEASE pass along this challenge to developers to write an OS-9 
driver, or program, that would allow command-line configuration of 
"standard" hardware in the setup file, and also specific keyboard input 
that would switch the console keyboard from the remapped arrangement 
back to the Sholes ("standard Qwerty") arrangement. The DOS Dvorak.SYS 
does this with Ctrl/Alt/F1 = back to Qwerty;  Ctrl/Alt/F2 = Dvorak.
        From within DOS, this free remapper works better than some 
shareware programs that want registration, and on machines that belong 
to me but that a non-Dvorak typist might need to type on, my present 
KeyTronic KB101Plus Professional Series with Dvorak Keyboard firmware 
is a BEAR to get in and twiddle the dipswitches.  (Brian White's 
KeyTime keyboard with a hardware hot-button was much nicer.)
  
        I can't (won't) switch back, and I really NEED the remapper 
programs.
        <begging and pleading mode off>
  
        Fooey, outta time!
