Oh yeah, it does.. matter of fact, the author of WPShel recommends Ved. Great
program, wpshel, and ved too. Now you just have to configure your system for
a serial mouse, if you haven't already done so, and your really cooking. Good

CL,

It works very well with VED.  I use it a lot.  I recommend that you also get
TSSpell from Tandy to use as your spell checker.  It is IMHO the best spell
checker written for OS-9.  In addition, I use the VU text viewer from Vaughn
Cato here in the database as the text viewer with WPShel.  Incorporate VPrint
into WPShel as your text formatter for printing and voila! -- a word
processing package.  Really a bright idea.

Let us know if you need any setup advice.

Good Luck.

Hadn't thought about that.  This could be his problem..

I think you're alright if you always create your CMDS directory at the
same spot all the time.. I.E.. if you "makdir CMDS" first each time you
format a disk, then you can read them, but it's safest to assume this is
not the case.

John is referring to the case where you take a disk out and then reinsert
another.. If the CMDS directory doesn't happen to be listed at the exact
same spot on the disk, OS9 can't find the directory listings.

What error do you get?  If you didn't chx to the new disk, did you give
an absolute pathname?

Hate to belabor the point, but John was correct in msg 92142. While the
sensor may be in the drive, 1773's, CoCo's, and os9 all uniformly ignore
the thing! The real problem is that the "cmds" dir that he is "chx'd" to
is not in all probability located in the exact same sector of the disk
for a starting point on the second disk unless its an exact, made by
backup copy of the first disk. No op-sys that I know of stores its pointers
to the current directory as a text string that would require a search of
the disk from sector zero to find each time. What they all do is store the
address of the starting sector of that directory. If the disk is changed,
and the new disk doesn't have exactly the same address for the file
descriptor that describes the cmds dir, then the system is lost until
the operator issues a "chx (or d) /device/pathname/pathname" so that
os9 is then required to do this search, from square one, and find the location
of this new directory which it then stores as the sector offset address in
its own internal drive table.

Go to "data app" and do a search for "smouse". The docs are there. Have you got
Nitros9,use a MPI. If so, the job gets a little involved. But I believe its
worth it. I'm still ironing out the bugs on an 'IRQ hack'. I'm close, but not

It's possible.. It might be worth looking into.. One of Our BBS's, it

We don't have that many people, but we still might have enough dedicated
callers to get something going.

Yes, 2400 is really a drag once you get used to something faster.. I call
long distance for my Tymnet connect here and for my CI$ connections.  The
Tymnet is supposed to be 9600, but the CI$ is supposed to be 14.4, but it
winds up at 9600 over half the time.. Guess they have lots of older modems
still connected.

I knew there was not much difference, if any.  I was just quoting off the

It was just a few years ago I gave over $300 for an 80 meg.. a 500 meg
at that time (that would have been a _huge_ drive then) would have been
up towards $1000, if not more.

Well, waiting is OK, up to a point.  But, to be honest, I'd hate to take

I think that when you get your HD and all up and running, you'll be thrilled.
I'm really impressed with OSK.  There might be a few aspects where the OSK
systems have not caught up with the coco yet, but in most cases, they are
equal or superior.  For one thing, most of the util commands have more
options that come in handy.  The coco has most of these features, but you
have to call up more different commands to  do them. One thing that comes
to mind is dsave's "-e" function, where you can execute dsave's commands
rather than piping into a shell.. Also, you have the option of overwriting
files on the destination disk if the source file is newer.  Small features,
but nice.

For some reason or another, many coco3 problems occured because the GIME
chip wasn't seated properly into it's socket.  Use a couple jewelers
screwdrivers to GENTLY pry it out, clean the contacts with alcohol or
tape head cleaner and firmly press it back into the socket, making sure
to align it correctly.  The is one corner on the chip with a bevel that
will match in the socket.  If that doesn't work, pull the 512k upgrade
up so the pins don't press all the way through the header connectors,
as they can short out on some of the traces on the motherboard.  Both
of these things have "fixed" ECCCC members computers in the past.
A good investment is "Tandy's Little Wonder" distributed by Farna
Systems for around $20-$25.  It has many tips on repairing, upgrading
it contains schematics, past and present software and suppliers.  It

is a handy book to have around as a reference.  Also, if the above
doesn't fix your coco, direct questions to Marty Goodman, if anyone
can help, he probably can.  But first search through the message
forum for messages with subjects that sound like they are related

I do not have two RS232's running, but I'll throw my two cents in.  On one of
your RS232's you have to do a hardware modification to change the address it
recognizes.  If you have a connect RS232 it is a mater of moving a jumper.
The instructions come with it.  Once you have modified the RS232 then the
driver must be modified so that it works with the new address.  I believe
this is documented in the database and in the instructions that come with
the connect RS232.

To get both ports working at the same time, you will need to strap all
of the "pin 8"s together on the MPI so that the interrupt gets through
regardless of which slot is selected as active.

Ted
   Thanks for pointing out the joystick info in the GoldRunner manual. The
values that Eric got after changing resistor values, is what I get now.
 The Centered values are around 100, with upper left 0, and lower right 127.

   I debating whether to go in and change the resister values so the center
values are around 64. If I do that, then I won't be compatable with all the
other MM/1's. This problem and the little thing about not being able to read
the joystick while playing sound, has me wondering if the joystick port
should be forgotten, and something else used in its place, like one of the
serial ports and a serial type control pad, like on the CD-I machines or the
Nintendo machines. Do you know if anyone has looked into or played around
with what would be needed to be able to plug(with appropriate gender changes),
one of these serial type control pads, into an MM/1 serial port ? Something
like this would sure make it easier on everyone.

Yup...It just bugs me that the price just happened to go down a month after
I bought my current hard drive. :-)

Seriously, just head for the bookstore or supermarket, find the magazine
rack, and buy a copy of *Deforestation Monthly*--er, *Computer Shopper*.
Look about anywhere therein.

 > Also cables and necessary drivers.

Ditto for cables; heck, you can probably buy the connectors and 50-pin
ribbon cable and roll your own.

Drivers...hmmm.  It's been a while since I had a CoCo, and when I did,
I didn't have a SCSI drive on it, so I'm probably not the best source
for driver information, but I think the way to go these days is to get
Matt Thompson's SCSI software for the CoCo.

     Hard drive prob
     From: WDTV5        To: ALL

Howdy all; Once again I seem to have a puzzler here. Trying to make a 2nd
hard drive work on my office CoCo3/OS9 system. Using a B&B XT-RTC interface,
with an ST-11m controller. Drive 0 has been working for several years, its
an older Tandon 252, the one the shack sold as a 10 meg kit 10 years ago for
their pc type machines. I've been able to declare an old L.E. model D dead,
and grabbed the ST-238r out of it. Now this is exactly the same as an St-225
except this drive had plated disks, and it can be used as an MFM drive using
exactly the same descriptor one would use for an ST-225. You only get 21 megs
that way instead of 32, but thats 21 I didn't have before. The problem is that
I can't get it to verify past 10 megs when formatting it. Before someone says
the drive is actually bad, I have 2 of them and they both work identically!
When the first one wouldn't work, I brought my own old 238 in and tried it.
Same problem, verify kicks out continuous errors for any sector address
above $A209. It not track related, I can shut it down to a single side
and get all 614 tracks. Double headed, maybe... I think it worked once...
Turn on all 4 heads and its dead at that address. I've checked the head
select lines at the connector (pins 14 and 18) while its formatting and
the expected activity is there. So I wrote a quicky little basic proggy
to scan the drive after telling it n for the verify question. Then it
does not show the expected head select activity! I'm thinking maybe there
is a bug in BBFHDisk.dr (crc unk, len $6B6) that only shows up for drive
one. And then again, the other drives capacity is about a track short
of triggering it if its also a bug for drive zero. Anybody care to take
a stab at this one? I'm stumped, short of swapping the drive assignments,
a not very trivial job due to the requirements of bootup, I don't know
how else to attack this problem. Any and all help, hints etc (cases of
IceHouse?) gladly accepted.
Cheers, Gene Heskett, WDTV5@delphi.com

     Powerboost Problem???
     From: DBREEDING    To: ALL

I've just come across what may be a problem with Powerboost.

A little history.  I had written a database program, originally for the coco
in Basic09.  I've now redone it for OSK in "C".  I had a database of
315 entries, consisting of a date and 6 integers each.  Being the lazy type,
I decided to write a filter to read an ascii text output from the old
program, and send it to stdout, where I could pipe it into the program,
thus eliminating a bunch of tedious typing.

I did it...  Ran it under OSK and it worked apparently perfectly.  I then
compiled the program on the CoCo (both the program and the filter).
But...  the thing wouldn't work.. The way the filter worked, it first "typed
in" a "1" (menu choice) and then "typed in" the filename of the database
the program was going to use (the ascii file was hardcoded in).

But the thing would get all confused.  I worked a couple of days changing
the input methods around, thinking it was a compiler thing, but finally, I
tried something else.. I had been running under Powerboost.  I booted under
6809 mode and it finally worked like a charm (went back to my original
code).  I even tried just running the program with input redirected from
a file created by the filter (the filter was sending the correct data to
standard out).

Apparently, somewhere, data was being lost somewhere in the pipe.  Wrong
values were being received by the program.  I suspect that if data
was being supplied when the program was not ready to accept it, it was
just being shot out into never-never-land.

I wonder if this might be a major problem for Powerboost users.  (I think
it's _got_ to be in this.  If I remember correctly, Powerboost modified
_original_ modules, so it should not be caused by other hacks - or so I
would think.

Did you ever get your E-mail problem solved? I meant to send a message to
SERVICE for you a few days ago, but just got back online today after
struggling with a hardware problem. The problem itself wasn't that bad, but
was very time consuming to fix. Anyway, let me know how you've made out so
far and I'll get it taken care of if it still exists.
