            Agreed, bigtime. Save those for the magazines that are
          still standing. The MOTD IMO, should focus on the things you
          menioned, and informing the community about the community
          and what is going on around relating to OS-9. Joel's new
          interview series is a good idea, and it's good to see 'From
          The Horses Mouth' continuing, even if DCCS has been out for
          months now<Grin>.

     OS-9 Late Night
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL

exit
            This is just a reminder that next weeks installment of
          'OS-9 Late Night' will not be an Open Forum as it says in
          the conference banner. Since posting that schedual,  Brother
          Jeremy has told me he will be in to with Rickuland to do a
          conference on OS-9 Word Processing. If you have been
          interested in the project to port the classic Coco Max-10
          Word Processor, here is a good chance to get up to date on
          the latest scoop. Also, they will go into how text editing
          in OS-9 works, and perhaps the other stuff that is
          available.

            Also on the following week, January 16, 1995, the topic
          will be the anticipated, 'COUNTDOWN TO CHICAGO'. Members of
          the Glennside Color Computer Club will be on hand to give
          the lowdown on the upcoming Chicagofest, which takes place
          on April 29 and 30(I screwed up the conference banner. It is
          1995 obviously, and not '94). The Chicago Cocofest is one of
          the biggest events each year for the OS-9 and Coco
          communities. If you can attend please do so to help assure
          another one next year! Attend this conference for details
          how!

            Btw, for last night's conference, we did a preview of 1994
          and talked about what goals we should set to achieve in this
          coming year to further the cause of OS-9. It was a good
          conference to my surprise since I've not been posting
          reminders for the last few weeks, do to the hectic schedual
          on my end. The last two weeks of January, we will have Open
          Forums, and I am hoping to expand on this topic a little
          more and get more people together to discuss what they feel
          we should start doing more of in '95. OS9 User Group
          involvement is a definate must. Please bring your feelings
          and ideas to either of these 2 conferences, and/or post them
          here in forum. We should set some goals early and get the
          machine running for the coming year.

     Ted,

     For   OS9,  I've  found  it  usually  easiest  to provide  a
'semi-bootable'   floppy, or 'system image' this works on several
levels.
     The  floppy  user  can  do a backup from  disk  basic,  boot
somehow,  swap  disks,  and chx/chd. His /dd device will  be  /d0
anyway, so your floppy or an image runs fine in the one drive.
     To make a bootable, a simple script would allow you to pluck
a few vital utils from Master. User formatss and cobblers a disk,
then  dsave your floppy then runs your script which grabs  shell,
grfdrv,  etc  to  clean up. You can combine the  dsave  generated
script with your systmast plucker, and cut a few user typos.

     Hard  drive owners would cram your disk in a floppy, chd  to
it, and dsave /dx /dd ! shell. If the floppy is an exact image of
a  runnable  disk,  the hard drive becomes an exact  image  of  a
runnable   disk!    (plus  all that other crap the  user  already
did)  The  only point of contention is the user  directory  since
there are fairly rigid conventions for most of the dir tree.

     DD, as far as I know:

     junk  or temporary files (readmes, install scripts) place in
root  so they are instantly obvious and easily deleted. Don't add
_any_ perminant files to root!

     dd/CMDS            all execs
     dd/CMDS/ICONS      (cc3 only)

     dd/SYS             system files- termcaps, etc
     dd/SYS/MINE        apps with many SYS files grab a dir

     dd/DOCS            da manual

     dd/DEFS         \
                       > those who write
     dd/LIB          /

     dd/SOURCES         often subdivded by language then program-
                         /dd/sources/b09/thisthing/code.b09

     dd/USR/*           where the AIFs play. Undefined but
                         typical branches- USR/TCOM,  USR/GAMES,
                         etc...

     dd/USR/*/other     nice  apps  hide weird  files  _beyond_
                         where the user sees the datafiles.

     Applications  have been known to grab extra directories from
root.  This  makes sense on floppies, where /dd/MINE is  all  the
housekeeping  needed. But this is horribly ugly after a few dozen
apps are installed on ahard drive, and positively stops multivue.
Even  if  the  user doesn't use a 'usr' directory, he can  use  a
convienient  dsave  handle  for custom installs. It does  look  a
little weird having an empty dir level on a floppy, thou.

  I agree. I am building a 486DX2-80 machine right now, simply because I need
more power and can't afford to get into OSK yet. If OS-9000 was cheaper, I
mightbe interested, but I doubt if I can afford it. I am going to try to run
OS9-
6809 on the CoCo-3 Emulator, but I seriously doubt if it will support serial
I/O, hard disk access, or even have the ability to read/write OS-9 floppies.
I feel that if OS9-6809 is to live on, it must be through a method like this.
If everybody pitched in and worked on drivers which support PC hardware, we
could make the IBM-compatible the most desirable machine to run it on. I would
really like to buy an MM/1 because OSK is definitely a large step ahead of
Level-2. Unfortunately it is out of my price range, though, and I have specific
applications which I need an IBM for. Maybe an "MM/2" will emerge someday,
which will allow the use of standard PC hardware like IDE drives and standard
SVGA
monitors. Just wishful thinking...

I don't know... I peiced together a 486 box in the last two days... and it
ran me over 1700$, and that didn't include the monitor/keyboard/mouse.
And it appeard that the Floppy controller on the do everything multi-io card
is bad, or doesn't get along with the motherboard. I'll mostly be using it
to run Linux though, which is close enough to OS-9 to make the system
"friendly" to my tastes... MAybe someday I'll pick up OS-9000 and G-Windows
for it... That will have to wait for a bit though...

     Don't you mean the CoCo-2 emulator? I don't think there is a CoCo3
emulator. Is there? I have used the CoCo2 emulator and not only is does
look and feel exactly like a CoCo2, the docs say that you can have serial

   Yes, there is a CoCo-3 emulator. Look in the documentation on the CoCo
Emulator v.1.4, which is in the CoCo SIG. Like the CoCo-2 Emulator, the CoCo-
3 Emulator emulates all of the features of a real CoCo-3 with 4 floppies.
However, I am not sure if it works too well with Level-2. I have tried running
Level-1 on the CoCo-2 emulator; it didn't want to boot. TTYL,

I assume new is OK?  I do some buying from MidWest Micro, 6910 U.S Rt.36
East, Fletcher, OH, 45326  PH 800-552-8080.  The best thing is to go
ahead ahd get 1.44 Meggers, since new 720's, if available, are as
high as 1.44's.  All you have to do is use DD disks and noto HD's
and the disk will work great.

Really, you might do well to browse through Computer Shopper for the
closest/cheapest, but I'll give you MidWest's #'s in case you want
to order from them:

       Mitsumi    004372   $35
       Teac       002694   $38
       Frame kit for 5.25 bay   003581 $4.00  (if you need it)

They didn't list a 720, and they might have other brands available;
also, prices may be a little different

Actually, you might be able to just crimp one of the connectors onto
your existing cable.  The only gotcha you need to watch for is that
all the 3.5's I've fooled with (well, only 2) have had pin 1 on the
opposite side from that of the 5.25's.  You might have to allow for
twisting the cable to get pin 1 over on the other side -- maybe have
the 3.5 connector facing the opposite way from the 5.25's.  Let's see,
does the power connector take the same Plug as the 5.25?  I think so,
better check.  BTW.. here's my dmode for the 720-K setting*


    nam=D1 mgr=RBF ddr=CC3Disk hpn=07
    hpa=FF40 drv=01 stp=03 typ=20
    dns=03 cyl=0050 sid=02 vfy=00
    sct=0012 t0s=0012 ilv=02 sas=08

The only difference is dns & cyl.  Note I have found that an ilv
of 2 works on my system with both the 3.5 and 5.25, and it is just
a little faster that way.

If you have to make up your own cable, you will need, of course,
a length of 34-wire flat ribbon cable.  all your connectors will
be 34-pin crimp-on.  You need a card-edge connector for the controller
end, a card-edge connector for each 5.25, and an IDS socket for
each 3.5. (Better get at least one spare of each, they're cheap,
in case you lunch one).  All this can be had at Radio Shack.  They
also make an IDC Connector crimper, it's around $15, and makes it
a little easier to squeeze the connectors onto the cable.  Also,
in case you are not familiar with this stuff, the connectors will
have a little arrow or mark "indexing" your pin 1, and also, the
cable will have the wire on one side a different color. This is

Hopefully I'm sending this to the right person.  I know format -nvnp -v=test
but(slash)dx does give info on hard drives and seems to give some info on
floppies
on my MM/1.  Maybe something like this could be tried?

Well, if I weren't so lazy, I could try it on mine..  I'd actually forgotten

Basically, they were to prevent you from actually formatting the drive but
allow you to get the settings to use when you mess with dmode so the number of
sectors on the drive and descriptor matched (cylinders and sides don't have to
match it seems).  I tried it on a formatted floppy and it seemed to work.  The
-nvnp inhibited the physical format and verify.  You just read the stuff on
the SCSI (lsn 0 I believe) device which is put on by the manufactorer.  Now I
hope this might tell about the floppy....I could be wrong because this might
just tell about the descriptor, not the media.  Of course if the disk is too
far off, then you couldn't read it at all.  Worth a shot.

I would be very interested in Ribbs_OSK.  I used to run Ribbs
on my CoCo-III.  I still have the extra phone line and now
have a 28.8 modem. Will in run on most any OSK system (Kix\30?)

     Shanghai OS-9
     From: EARTHER      To: ALL

     I'm working on a new version of Shanghai for OS-9 Level II.  I need
 some ideas for improvement from those of you that have played the
 game.  One thing that I changed so far was the double-clicking on
 the second tile chosen.  Only a single click is required on both
 tiles now to remove them.  I noticed that the OS/2 Warp version of
 Shanghai didn't use a double-click, so I thought mine shouldn't
 either.  I can now remove tiles quicker than before (it's slow
 enough having to refresh the screen as it is!).  Anyway... let
 me know what ideas you have for the new release, thanks!

The funniest thing I've seen lately is the IBM OS/2 commercials.
They have secretaries and business people talking about what they do
while they wait for their document to print, since apparently the
systems they had been using didn't multitask while printing.  When they
show OS/2's ability to work on something else while their documents are
printing, you should see their little faces light up, and the
expressions of surprise and amazement.  Of course, as you said, we've
been doing it for a decade and a half...

Yeah.  This is another thing the PC hackers seem to be always griping
about.  Wonder.. is OS/2 any better?

Of this 640K barrier might be something similar to what we were about to
get into on the CoCo.  If we go much further in memory expansion, I think
we would be getting into the problem of running out of System Memory.  I
know my map was beginning to get pretty full.  I never ran out of Sys Mem
except for just a few times.

Seems like everything wants more memory these days..  I have had several
people looking at getting PC's.  I've been strongly recommending that they
go with at least 8 meg.

I've found that most people get a computer thinking they will never get
any deeper involved.  I have a brother who wanted a PC.  I kept trying to
tell him to look at expansion, but he knew.. "this" is all I'll ever
want to do..  He wound up getting a Packard Bell, and now, after a couple
or 3 months, is beginning to want to add cards, and he may find that it
won't be so easy.

For my part, I don't know what I'll do.. I am certainly interested in the
Mac, although I don't really need anything else.  It's just that it would
be nice to get some of the "ready-to-run" stuff.

     I'm getting my Mac advice from JOELHEGBERG. For personal use mostly but
it will defentaly help me develop graphics for the MM/1. I plan to do DTP
out of my house. I know one person who is using the Mac to make an action
game for the MM/1. <g> And my offer still stands to Digital Frontier Prod.
to update the graphics for GR2000. I think there is an infomercial for the
Mac floating around the airwaves late at night, still trying to catch it.

Windows and multitasking can be cute, to say the least. One way to look at
the difference between true multitasking and cooperative multitasking is as
follows:

True Multitasking: 100 times per second (assuming this is the clock interval)
the operating system receives a hardware interrupt from the clock and
compares the priority of the current task with other tasks to determine whether
it should switch tasks.

Cooperative Multitasking: 18.2 times per second the windowing environment
receives a clock tick. It then compares process priorities, determines
whether a proper message has been passed, and flips a coin. Heads the current
task keeps running. Tails the current task keeps running. Only in the rare
event that the coin lands on its side does it switch tasks -- and then only
if it feels like it. :-)

Glad they were able to come up with something "new"..  <G>
I had a friend who was in the business of assembling and selling clones.
I remember when about 10 years ago or whatever, when Dos (or was it
Windows) got the ability to just HOLD (not run, just hold) 2 programs
in memory at once, he thought he had discovered another planet or something.

To enter the discussion, 16 MEGS of memory is what I would recommend to anyone
wishing to buy a PC system and use it EXTENSIVELY.  If one wants to do only
word processing and the occasional spreadsheet, 8 megs is probably sufficient.
 The graphical overhead of Windoze programs demands lots of memory and special
busses to move the data.  As quoted above, nothing is re-entrant so OS2
creates virtual machines to multitask DOS programs. This eats memory fast.
Memory management in DOS has never been adequate from the beginning.  IBM
never became interested in speed until Compaq started kicking their butts with
speedier designs.  All of these deficiencies, ironically, are what fed
developers of support hardware and software so that the PC eventually became
the platform of choice.  Each deficiency spawned new adapter card makers and
software programs to "fix" the problems.  The array of PC memory management
software available illustrates the point.  As each problem fix becomes
popular, Microsoft adds the feature to DOS.  DOS 6.22 now includes Doublespace
to compress files, Emm386 to manage memory, Memmaker to rearrange storage when
out of memory programs burp, etc., etc., etc.

My advice to anyone considering a PC system is to buy it from one of the major
Direct channel marketers like Gateway, Zeos or Dell and load it with all of
the hardware and software you think you will ever need at purchase time.
Since direct marketers deal in volume and compete intensely, you will realize
discounts on hardware and software which you will not be able to match at a
retail store.  In addition, the systems are guaranteed, loaded with software
and fully configured when you receive them.  Believe me, the hassles of buying
that "bargain" at Sears and then adding peripherals, configuring the BIOS,
resolving IRQ conflicts and finding that you have 300MB of hard disk used in
only 2 weeks is more than mildly annoying!  Most Windoze programs take about 2
MB of disk space, so I would recommend at least a 500 MB drive, but,
preferably, 700 MB.  That means tape backup for safety and archiving and on
and on and on and on and on...  What a racket, eh?  A tribute to American
ingenuity.

So, you ask.  Why don't more people use OS9?  Heh, heh, heh...because it WORKS
that's why!

I've had something of a hankering for a Mac for some time, just was
a little shaky about getting one.  My main reason for either a Mac or
PC would be so I could be "mainstream" on some of the stuff so I could
share stuff.  I don't know that many people with Macs close to me, there
are some, of course, but I feared I might still not have the "compatibility"
that I desired.

Are you still in the process of buying or do you already have one?  (I'm
in "read new" mode in ix right now and can't check back).

Anyway, there seem to be more decisions to make with the Mac that with
the PC, doesn't there?  And now we have PowerPC, and the 6100 doesn't
seem that expensive, either.

 Are you talking about the Blackack I wrote for G-Windows?   If so there is
 an E-mail and snail mail addresses in the docs and the readme where I can be
 reached if there is a problem.  RTFM.

 Even if you had the source you might not be able to get the program running
 anyway.  You would need wmlib.l from the devpack and, if there's a problem
 with 'math', you may need the 'no math traps' (_nmt) version of the gadget
 modules.  I don't include those last with the package but they should be
 available from your G-Windows vendor.

 This will be less of a problem with my software in the future becasue I'm
 switching to Ultra-C exclusively.  Every package will include the Microware
 support modules.  CyberWar, which I've posted but hasn't been made visible
 yet, includes these modules.  Sometime this month I will be releasing a new
 version of Blackjack which has been ported to Ultra-C and compiled for both
 OSK and OS9/x86.

 I believe PAGAN wrote Black Jack using Ultra C.  The CIO and MATH modules
 are replaced with the appropriate CSL and FPU modules.  To the best of my
 knowledge, these modules require version 2.4 or later of OSK to function
 properly.

 One of the reasons PAGAN used Ultra C was to ease porting to OS9000/386.
 I did the port to OS9000/386 for Stephen and it was a trivial task under
 Ultra C.

 > We have too many different specialized machines to cope with to allow

 The approach PAGAN used is hardware independent.  But it does require
 current versions of OS9/68000 or OS9000/386.  I don't think it requires
 the latest version of G-WINDOWS but I may be wrong.

 As to source code for Black Jack, I believe Stephen has done some things
 he believes are unique and proprietary to him hence his reluctance to
 distribute source.

Just out of curiosity, will the original source be about the same (command-
wise)?  If so, this will give us a chance to compare the two.. well, maybe
not the BEST example, since so much depends on user input.

BTW.. I put in my order for UCC about a week ago.. have you gotten your
commision yet <G>.  Anyway, I decided I may as well jump on the bandwagon,
because it looks like this is the way to go, and there's no use in writing
a bunch of code that will need to be modified.

I do see that this is one problem.  Probably the best thing where size is
not critical (I think this is the purpose of cio & math) would be to
not call them, and let the program handle this.

 > We have too many different specialized machines

Well, that is a point.  It is OK to release code for little stuff, but
I would think the best way to go would be if say, I write a really
good program for G-Windows that would find great general appeal, to
designate one MM/1 person to port it to K-Windows, and let him be
responsible for that version.  In your case, with Blackjack, after reading
PAGAN's reply, you might send him a request and he might recompile it without
the math trap.

    Interesting. I've played MR a bit and wasn't very impressed by it. The
graphics are great but the control seems to be a bit lacking. However, the
general consensus over on C-Serve is that it grows on you and is actually a
really good game, a judgement you seem to concur with.

      Thanks, after bieng offline for a month I allmost forgot about it
myself.

      Ok, all MM/1 owners. I plan to produce an FMV game for the MM/1 that
will be later ported to CDI. I am buying a Macintosh to handle the real time
capturing of video. I do need someone to write an animation format for MM/1
so I can port the FMV frame by frame. (or I can see about restrictions on
the use of Autodesk's FLI format for profit)

      WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO is voice your support for the FMV game on the
MM/1. I don't ask for any quota of yes votes but I would like to know if I
should bother pressing 100 disks with MM/1 spesific data on it. I hope I can
use the same data for CDI but I might want to use Digital Video. There are
alot of things I have to think over before I start. I may even do filming at
Chi Fest '95 for the game. The game will be on a CD, the format of the CD
isn't set yet but I think it will be CD-i. Game price is somewhere around
$50, it depends on alot of things.

      So please vote! Even if you don't have a CD-ROM drive.

      I hate to include this in this post but The Compiler is no longer in
production. It may return later if I can afford Digital Video mastering
equipment. I should have alot of these decisions made in February. The
Compiler was too much to handle alone (and I mean I was my own cameraman).

In my efforts to learn more about UNIX, I have both LINUX (yes it's
free) and COHERENT running on my messydos box.  I got linux on a
couple CD's for about $16.00 at a local computer show.  I bought
COHERENT (about $150).

Both of them work fine on my lowly 386/SX-25.  I have X-Windows running
under COHERENT, - LINUX does X-Windows too, but (so far) it doesn't
like the cheap VGA card I have.  Both seem be pretty good UNIX-type
systems, but I cannot compare them to other UNIX systems except to
say that they act like UNIX manuals say they should.  I have no
experience on UNIX systems -- that's why I got them.

For more info, and a running flame war between LINUX and COHERENT
fans, see comp.os.linux.*** and comp.os.coherent in the newsgroups.

They have helped me a lot to understand what is supposed to be
happening in those UNIX shell scripts in  GNU makefiles.

I'm running Linux (at least as much as I can) on a 386SX-25 system with a
50MB hard drive. It is a nice operating system and pretty much looks and
feels exactly like Unix. Lots of GNU stuff is available as is X windows.
The easiest way to get into Linux is to pick up the Slackware Linux CD.

     CDP 1302 Sony For Sale
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

I found this on internet
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I have a 4 year old Sony CPD-1302 13" color RGB monitor for sale.
It was previously used on both a Macintosh and a PC clone. It is
in excellent working order.  The monitor has a 9 pin plug so you
will need a proper cable for whatever computer you will use it
with. The monitor is a Multiscan type with the following frequencies:
Vertical: 50-100Hz
Horiz: 15.0-34.0kHz
It handles both analog and TTL input and can sync down to NTSC video
frequencies. I have the original manuals for it but not the original
box. I'm selling because I have moved up to a 17" monitor. I'm
asking $90.00 and you pay shipping. If interested send me email to:

sep@netcom.com


Thanks,
Scott

Yes, me!  :)  I plan on uploading it tonight or tomorrow night so it
should be available soon.  Amazingly, only half of my notes were covered
so I need to schedule another online conference to take care of the
uncovered material.

     Emulator
     From: PHILSCHERER  To: ALL

I downloaded the Coco2 emulator in the Coco database and when I try to
unzip it, the file names are listed but it tells me that it doesn't
know how to handle them. Any clues will be appreciated. <Phil>

That emulator file was zipped with the newer version on pkzip.
Vs 2.04 I think is the number.
Anyway the older pkunzip.exe will not work on it.
I believe that the CoCo unzip is based on the older versions.

Thanks for the info but I do not have an MM1. The printer driver is suppose to
support  the QuadJet printer.
