Chris, did the original model require the cartridge to play the videos? Or
was it ready for them (I know it cost a good deal more, but could have just
been cost of new technology at the time)? Also, will the current cartridge
work with the older models (if required?)

  The original did not come with the digital cartridge. I purchased one
about a year ago at Best Buy. I had a long list of compatible players,
including the Philips CD910 (which is what the Memorex is inside). So it works
fine!!!

You cannot have initialized data (or any data structure) in a subroutine
module.. All data will have to be passed as parameters.  If you're not
familiar with how Basic passes variables, you'll need to review this.

CoCo packages had an option in the linker (-b, I think) that would
link a Basic09 subroutine package.. if you have the Coco compiler, you might
review it for some pointers..  You might need to look at the OSK Basic
docs to see that the correct register (a6) is used to point to the data
area.  I know in CoCo OS9, you had to juggle it around.  I don't have
OSK Basic so don't have the docs for it.

One other little gotcha, too, if you deal with floating point variables,
you might want to verify that both C and Basuc use the same format for
storing the Floating Point data.  This was another difference in the
CoCo, but I think maybe they are the same in OSK.  The way to check this
is to pass a float from basic to your subroutine and do a "printf"
to see if it's the same.

I thought the literature for OSK Basic _did_ list the same format as
the one in C, but wasn't sure.  I don't have OSK Basic, so wasn't able
to give a definitive answer, though.

  I also discovered that the cstart.a I have also gives the same error for
the following C program.

#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
}


   I tried using the cstart.a that I already had and got the same error.
I then used the cstart.r that I always use with C programs and it compiled
and worked. Thus the cstart.a file I have is bad.
   OSK Basic passes all pararmeters via the stack.

D0 = parameter count
D1 = address of first parameter
stack = first 4 bytes = address of second parameter
        2nd   4 bytes = address of third  parameter

and so forth.

If I remember right a C program using the d

main(argv,argc)

parameter comes out the same way.

Also making ML subroutine modules from assemble is easy. All that is need
is to set the psect to

  psect Name,(Sbrtn<<8)!Objct,(ReEnt<<8)!1,0,0,Name

Since the cstart.r contains the front end code for a C program, that is
where the main psect is located.

OSK is different from OS9 (6809). There is not much difference between a
C program and a ML program in OSK as far as how parameters are passed.

I suppect that the cstart.a file I have is bad and if I could fine a
cstart.a that will compile with the Hello.c program, I may be able to
come up with a way to make ML subroutine modules for Basic using C.

Did you just take the cstart.a that came with the system and edit the
PSECT?  That won't work.. There are data variables set up in it and this
won't work, as data variables are not allowed in a subroutine module.
If you want to do a universal rof, you might first push the first
parameter's data onto the stack first off, then you could set up a
header file to define your offsets, like
    #define PNUM 0
    #define P1Adr 4
    #define RET   8
    #define P2Adr 12
       ...   {add enough for all cases }

Hmmm... OSK Basic doesn't pass parameter size?  If so, you need to
add this between all the parameter addresses.

Again you probably won't need any type of lead-in psect.. Or, you might create
one just so you would have the psect set up and possibly define the
parameter passage stuff.

One other thing RE: your cstart.a. You didn't try to compile the cstart.a
using "cc" did you"  This won't work, because it will try to
include "cstart.r" when it compiles.  You might want to write a "makefile"
for your assembly.. you can use "cc -r..." to compile the original .c
sources to rof's, but in the end you'll have to call "l68" directly
for the final compile pass.

Possibly not, see above.

One way to tell is to do a "cc -r cstart.a" to compile a new cstart.r
(don't overwrite your original, do this in /r0 or somewhere).. Then
cmp your new cstart.r to the original.. (there will be a few bytes
different in the date area, but you can figure them out).

   I made a new makefile having it compile the stock cstart.a along with
the following C code.

#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
   printf("Hello World");
}

This time I didn't touch anything in the cstart.a . Just had the makefile
compile both the cstart.a and the above code. Got the same error.
 Turned around and changed the makefile to use the cstart.r in the
i  /dd/lib directory. Compiled with NO errors. This is why I say the cstart.a
in the /dd/def directory is BAD.
  The first step made a cstart.r, but when the linker tried to combine the
two, that is when I got the error.

  I have a friend that has a OSK disasemmbler. I may ask him to decode the
cstart.r into a assemble source file for me and then try it out.
  There has to be a way to make ML subroutine files from C that OSK Basic
can use.
  When we translated the old 6809 ML code into 68000 code. All that was
needed to make them into subroutine ML programs that OSK Basic could read
was to change the psect and setup the front end to reconize how OSK Basic
sends data to a ML program.
  OSK Basic sends data to a ML in the following manor

  D0 = Parameter Count
  D1 = 1st parameter

Bottom of stack
  4 bytes - Second Parameter
up 4 bytes - Third parameter


and so forth.

  This is the same as when parameters are sent to a C program.

main(argv,argc)

argv - argement list
argc - argement count.

When compiled to ML, the argv and argc use the same registers and stack
arangement as above that Basic uses when passing parameters to a ML
subroutine module.

  Since the two are SO similiar, there HAS to be a way to write subroutine
ML modules for Basic using C and I suppect it has to do with the
cstart module.

  Since the cstart.a routine in /dd/defs seems to be bad, I need a cstart.a
that WILL compile and link with the above simple C code to start off with.

Yes, but when you made your dependency list for your module, did you
specify the command to be "l68 cstart.r ...."?  What I'm saying is, if
the name of the above program is "test.c", and your output program is
to be named "test", you need something like this: (I'm going to indent
to be sure the editor does not concatenate lines-the preceding dots
should not be there).

..test:
..   l68 cstart.r{that you made} test.r  .... -l=/dd/lib/clib.l

* if you do not include the above, make will send the command
    "cc cstart.r test.r {etc}..  and it will try to link cstart.r
twice.  This may be your trouble.

.. cstart.r:
.. test.r:
 > Turned around and changed the makefile to use the cstart.r in the

It shouldn't be..  As I said earlier, go to /r0 or somewhere, copy cstart.a
to there, and do cc cstart.a -r and then cmp it with your original cstart.r.
The bytes for the date will be different, but otherwise, it will more than
likely be the same.

 > The first step made a cstart.r, but when the linker tried to combine

See above.  I suspect that if you specify "l68", your own code will
compile.  Again, you will not be able to define any data areas in your
subroutine module.  Any variables you use will have to be passed from
Basic, and any you define in the module will have to be automatic, that is,
defined *WITHIN* the function itself (that is, after the first brace) and
none can be defined outside the function.  This applies to your cstart-type
module, it can not define any data storage.

No, no..  C *DOES NOT* normally pass the count and size to a function.
This is just a special case for main(), and cstart passes them itself, but
C does not automatically pass them.  When Basic calls a subroutine, IT
will pass them, and you will need to interpret them.

It sounds like you have not gotten rid of all your data variables.  If you
have, then I can't understand, but the error you are getting sounds like it
is... Be sure all your "vsect" variables are deleted and see what happens.
Especially if you can compile the program with it left as a program module..
Ummm.. yes!  If you can compile using the cstart.a without errors as a
program mod, then you have left the vsect variables in.. because otherwise,
you would get "unresolved variable references" in the link.  Be sure all
your vsects are removed.. you cannot have vsects in a subroutine module.

That _is_ something to look at.. You don't have an original distribution
disk?  Here's what you might try.. It could just be the way something is
defined.  Try assembling it (as a prog module), and then rdump both your
product and the original cstart.r, see if the CODE length is the same.
If so, make a .c file with just main(){} in it.  compile it and link using
both cstart's.  Have both modules with the same module name (you could
compile one, then rename the file, or use the -n option.  Then cmp
them.. If they are the same, then you're OK.. else you might check with
Dave Graham (you have an MM/1, don't you) and ask him to send you a
fresh copy of cstart.a  Technically, none of us would be supposed to
send it to you.

BTW.. my cstart.r is also 1274 bytes.

  Are you talking about removing the vsect entries in CSTART.A ??
Calvin Dodge sent me a file showing how to make a C subroutine and I was
able to duplicate what he sent. The problem is seems to be with things
like printf. In his approach, the linker balks at the printf statement.
Looking at the assemble file generated by C, it has a call to _printf,
which is the function to print a string on the screen.
  What I am after is be able to write a C subroutine that say will format
a window, set back/for ground colors, print text, mabey do some graphics,
and such. Using something like a C subroutine will run faster than doing
the same thing in Basic.
  If you like I can send you the approach that Calvin sent me. It works
for things like adding two Integer numbers and such, but the concept should

Right.  You cannot define data storage in a subroutine module.

Some of the library routines define data storage themselves and I think
printf _does_ define some.. maybe not globally, but no data structures
can be defined.
 > Looking at the assemble file generated by C, it has a call to _printf,
 > which is the function to print a string on the screen.

Is _printf() a function he defined?  If you want a printf, you will have
to define your own and somehow get around the data definitions, somehow
making them "automatic".  BTW, you'll probably not be able to use
any of the lib routines.  Many reference "errno", at the least.  Hmm..
you might, in your mainline subroutine module, push some stack area,
reset "a6" to point to the base, and define offsets within this stack
for "errno" etc.  (You'll need to save your original a6 and restore it
before exiting from the subroutine module.

Yes, it would probably be faster.  It may take some doing to get it to
work.. Would it be extremely hard to rewrite the whole program in C?  If
you're familiar with C, you can progress pretty quickly in making the
conversion.  I've done it myself and you can follow the Basic program's
structure pretty closely.

  First step is to get the program Basic/ML working as is. This is a port
from the OS9 Basic09/ML program.
  Next is to play around with this version, make enhancements, and ect.
Third step is to rewrite the program completely into C. The Basic/ML port
will become shareware and the C version will become commercial. The Basic/
ML version will be strickly MM/1, but the commercial version will be able
to be run on a non-MM/1 OSK platform.
  The shareware version could benifit from being able to use subroutines
that didn't have to be in only ML or Basic.
  I know that Power Basic has this abilty, was hoping a way was availble
to make it easier to make enhancement to the shareware version.
  BTW I did come across a C program on the Internet comp.os.os9, that sent
me some C code that showed how to make C Subroutine modules that could be
linked and accessed from a C program.

  It beginning to look like to be more trouble that it is worth, to make
or take a C program and make it into a subroutine module that Basic can
use.

Bob has VED and VPRINT; both of which are excellent products.

Another product to go with that is Tsspell, spell checker, from Radio
Shack. Cat. No. 26-3266. Let me know if you can't find it I have an
extra I may part with.

Also, to integrate it all together, you might want to get WPShel

WPShel sets up a point and click mouse interface for the above programs
and saves some typing at the command line.  I use all of the above.

REVKAK gave you Bob Van DerPoel's address..  I heartily recommend Ved,
coupled with VPRINT..  It takes a little time to set up the configuration
file (and you can have more than one).  These files define printer codes
to do some pretty fancy printing.  I have played around with it a little,
and if your printer has the capability, you can do some REALLY professional
looking output.

Ved supports wrap-around text, auto-indent, and just about anything you
would want.. The only drawback I have seen with it is that it does not
support control codes within the text.  No problem with normal text,
however.

Ved and Vprint are good as is WPShel from COLORSYSTEMS here.  Dynastar was the
featured word processor for OS-9, but it is only available now as used
software if you can find it.  Tandy also sold a program called TSWord.  It was
a graphical shell which work with component programs TSEdit, TSFormat and
TSSpell which is the best spell checker for OS-9.  These programs may still be
available from Tandy using the special order catalog.  Regarding text editors,
there is a score of them.  Check the database here.

If you use Multi-Vue and like the "point & click" interface style, a
fairly good word processor is still available from Owl Ware called
Window Writer v.1.3a writen by R.C. Dash.  It sells for around $50
and has a professionally printed manual.  After using Microsoft Word
at work on a PC, I got spoiled with using the mouse for so many
actions, that this one seems very intuitive and doesn't require a
great deal of time to learn.  If you don't have an old Rainbow

Multi-Vue is alright if you don't care to get too deep into OS-9, or if
you use Windows or a Mac and are spoiled with "point & click".  However,
I would not recommend MV if you don't have a hard drive.  To much disk
overhead for floppies.  I've been using a hard drive for 6 or 7 years
and I forget some users have floppy-only systems.  Multi-Vue is sometimes
a little slow, but can be improved with system patches and the use of
a 6309 cpu.

Hi Ken,

  Unfortunately, I have never been to Vulcan (Alberta I presume), and
again unfortunately, I have never been to my homeworld of Vulcan.  My
parents came to Earth many                              years ago as ambassa    
        dors to Earth.  I was
born in San Diego, California, but, I claim Vulcan as my home world
since I am indeed of that Galictic species.  (That should have been
"Galactic" not Galictic!)  I am told that computer keyboards on
Vulcan are more logically laid out and much easier to use!  Then
again, who needs a keyboard with voice interaction?  It is indeed
unfortunate that I cannot pass on "hellos" to your friends..{f*w3
  Whoa, I just got a line of random garbage printed in this message
as I was sitting here pondering my thoughts.  I wonder if it has any-
thing to do with this lousy weather we are having at this time.  Oh
well,  I do not think they will remain in this text since they look
like that would be printed if you listed a binary file to the screen.

I think the referance is to the ANSI escape sequences at the begining
of the tag lines, that show up as "garbage" characters for those that
don't use terminals that reconize ANSI escape sequences (like the ADM-3
I am on right now.) These type of escape sequences can really reck havoc on
certian terminals that don't reconize them (There are one that will lock up my
adm3, and require me to power cycle it to get it to work again)

 Yep, I think it is somewhat out of your control.  I just can't trust that
 guy to deliver on his promises- can't stay focused.  Instead of finishing
 OSK 2.4 for the Kix, he goes off and designs another board, the Kix\20.
 Not to mention that the original system would have sound and be "multi-
 media" like the MM/1 only (supposedly) better.  We are falling behind
 in Gwindows versions, presumably due to the lack of OSK 2.4.  And now,
 instead of meeting the original ( 1992) promise of 2.4, he goes off and
 fiddles around with Basic.  Would he care to respond, in writing, to
 this forum?

 I trust you will relay this to Mr. Smith.

 Allen Morgan

 BTW, I still have my receipt for the original disks I sent back to
 you in (damn, the exact date is smudged)  early 1994.  I guess I had
 better get them back.  The OSK 2.4 and latest Gwindows was going to
 be ready "any day now".

     Late Night Reminder:NX
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL

         This is another friendly reminder that this upcoming Monday,
       March 6 at 10:00 PM, Colin McKay of Northern Xposure, will be
       online representing his company to discuss the upcoming release of
       Nitros9 v 1.21. Nitros9 is a software update to the OS-9 Level II
       system which allows the system to run in 6309 Native Mode for
       those Coco's running with the 6309 Chip. This, for those who might
       not know, will give a considerable speedup boost to the Coco, that
       has been long overdue. Please try and be in attendance for this
       conference if you have any comments or questions, so perhaps Colin
       and Alan won't have so many Fido Net and Internet posts to answer
       over and over and over and over...<Grin>

         Also, the following week, on March 13, I will be discussing a
       project I am starting for the OS-9 Users Group. Since not all the
       details are completely hammered out, I will scratch the surface
       for now. It will be similar to Rick Cooper's 'Coco Directory',
       with more of an OS-9 slant. I will collect information that
       relates to topics specific to the OS-9 community and add it all to
       the respective databases. So far, off the top of my head, I have
       about seven or eight database files set up for these topics. For
       instance one database is for Users and will contain user
       information for all people within the Coco and OS-9 community.
       This data will include, Name,Address, Email Address, the computers
       they currenly use that run OS-9(I'm planning on taking information
       from DECB users also, but I'm not too clear on that yet. 1) I'm
       not sure if it's in the best interest of an OS-9 User Group and 2)
       Rick Cooper seems to be doing a fine job handling this area as it
       is, but this will be up for discussion). I have set up all these
       databases using the MSworks Database on the clone and I'm on the
       Coco right now, so I don't have the files in front of me, but I
       think there are a couple other fields in the 'Userlist' record
       that I'm unable to remember. Anyway, I hope you get the point(I'm
       not very good at putting ideas on paper). I am going to seperate
       the conference into to major parts. First I'm going to start it
       off by going into greater detail about this project and dig deeper
       into what it's many purposes will be. If we can make this work, it
       will be a BIG asset to the OS-9 community. This is a very
       important project and will play a big role in how difficult or
       easy future activity will be. Second, towards the latter part of
       the conference, I will seek out people who will be interested in
       volunteering their efforts in helping round up this information.

         This is a great opportunity for all of us OS-9 Users Group members
       to get together and finally WORK TOGETHER to accomplish a big part
       of the future of the OS-9 Market as we know it. Let's lay down the
       foundation for the future of the OS-9 Users Group! By the way, in
       either the upcoming MOTD or the one following that, will be an
       article also detailing my feelings on this project and some of the
       same topics that I will be presenting in the conference.

Well, I also think we have a "math coprocessor" in the brain some where.
There are times where I came up the right answer to a problem in school (I
teach Physics) without actually thinking about it.  Complicated stuff too.
I guess all the other trash going on between the ears gets in the way (grin).

  At present Ribbs_OSK is being ported to the MM/1 under KWindows. The
only reason for this is the orginal Ribbs ran under the COCO Windio and
KWindows is almost a exact copy as far as the commands are concerned. Thus
for now Ribbs_OSK will ONLY run on a OSK system running KWindows. After
we get the port complete, then I plan to re-write it into C. At that time
is will be easy to make a Gerneric version that will run on ANY OSK box.

  thanks for the interest. If you like I can keep you posted on the
development. I plan to either release it to the public or at least demo
it at the Chicago Fest. If you are going, make sure to stop by the
Blackhawk booth and say hello.

  I'll keep you informed. Two of us have just finsihed testing the OS9 code
part of the port. That is when you set OS9 as your terminal mode, Ribbs_OSK
does send out the correct codes. Colors are not correct, but that is in the
pallete selection. Need to setup correct color palette codes, but that is a
minor bug for now. ANSI selection bombs Ribbs_OSK to a command prompt.
Suppect a bad call, that should be easy to find.

Sounds like it is getting along.  My terminals are monochrome so color isn't
important (well, maybe......).  My friend Bob Billson used to use me to
beta test stuff he did because I had a color monitor on the CoCo while he had
monochrome.  Stuff would look good on his monitor but magenta on yellow didn't
quite look good (you should have seen yellow on magneta!).  Keep me (us)

Yeah, the Get/Put bugs are also holding up development of the K-W version
of another game.  Rumour has it that a "Windio V55" was under test that has
the fix, but it wound up in limbo when the re-patriation of Windio
ownership occurred at the end of February.

Best to speak with David Graham (NIMITZ) to find out what the plans are
for the next release of K-Windows.

I did compile and check out the code you posted earlier and ran some
experiments to be sure it wasn't caused by scaling, which it wasn't.
The test program you most recently posted shows a lot.  I'll post it in
the MM/1 Developer's Group and see what people say about it.  (I'll
forward email to you.)

We have to fix that!  :)

By the way, there was a problem with the exit of your program that
caused problems when running your older test-programs after running your
recent one.  2 things... you tried to do a KilBuf to a path after you
closed that path, and you also left off the P_id parameter on the KilBuf
call.

 > Select(Wpath);

Changed to:

 KilBuf(Wpath2, P_id, 0);

     Yes, because it looks like its going to be easier than I thought, to
   move pacman over to C. If you know of anyone that has some Pacman IFF
   sound effects.....

     Also, on the CoCo3, the game just used the joystick, but I was wondering
   if it should also be setup to be able to use the keyboard as well as the
   joystick on the MM/1. What do you think ?

   I guess I could say that I was too focused on the Get/Put problem or
   maybe it was late and I was tired, or someone came in when I was gone,
   or ..... DARN ! I can't think of any more excuses ;)

Excellent.  I'm sort of working on a game right now (not Pacman <grin>)
and I've been using my Mac to make/edit sound effects.  It's rather
interesting to see how you can turn a seemingly ordinary sound into
something very strange for a game.

Definitely keyboard!  (I've never had any luck with my joystick port on
the MM/1.)  Keyboard would be ideal, since the newest Windio (the one
Boisy uploaded recently to the database here) supports a _gs_keysns()
call to detect if the arrow keys are pressed.  I think the information
on the call may be in the docs included with the update.  If not, let me
know and I'll locate them for you.

 > or someone came in when I was gone,

You too?  That happens to me all the time as well!  Wish I could catch

With the right software, you can handle mail and news groups offline as well
with SLIP/PPP. All of the mailers for Windows (Pegasus, Eudora, etc.) batch
download mail so you can work offline. On the other hand, the current news
software I've found work with news groups online. Probably haven't found the
right news software yet and haven't had time to do it myself.

Of course, the big disadvantages with UUCP are the complexity (especially
setting up) and being limited to mail and news groups (and perhaps rare
FTP by mail transfers). SLIP is pretty easy to get going and lets you use
your choice of sockets-based software so you can do as much or as little
as you want. I started with Eudora then later switched to Pegasus for mail,
and handle all of my mail offline (both packages batch download mail with
POP3 and batch upload with SMTP). News groups I handle online with either
Trumpet News or WinVN (WinVN has a nice UU decoder built in that handles
split files) because I haven't found an offline news reader/downloader yet
for Windows Sockets.

The account I have with the local service provider is $26.95 per month and
is unlimited time so I don't have to watch the clock.

But those of us who want to run news for our bulletin board systems uucp
is the best way to get news.  For personal reading SLIP will allow you
to read online, but for those of us who do NOT have local access to
the internet can't afford to read news and mail online.  Also for people
like me who only have a CoCo, there is no SLIP software at this time, though
a package has been ported that hopefully will be released soon.  Also UUCP
does not tie up phone lines as often as running UUCP.

These services are better accessed INHO using a login shell account on a Unix
machine that is connected to the internet or using an online service such as
Delphi.  Why do individual users need to become PART of the internet when
it is cheaper usually to access through a login account.

I have to admit, there are a few die-hards around that think the no-code
license is the FCC's curse to amateur radio, but those are few and far
between -- thank goodness! Most of the amateurs in the Louisville area
admittedly had mixed emotions at first, but now think it is an excellent
entry-level license that opens the world of amateur radio. Of course, this
stems from the fact that the majority of the Technician class licensees in
the area are fine folks. Not everyone will upgrade beyond Technician, but
nobody I knows holds that against them. After all, not everyone has the
desire to work the HF bands and, frankly, I don't know anyone that can afford
to take full advantage of the VHF spectrum.

I entered the hobby as a Technician and decided to upgrade to Tech Plus
(5 wpm code) and General (13 wpm code) to obtain HF voice privileges. It was
a little over a year that I decided to upgrade. I guess I may be one of the
few code lovers left, but I've enjoyed working CW so much that I'm trying to
push my code speed as high as I can go. I think I'm more surprised than anyone
because a year ago I wouldn't touch code with a 10 foot pole; now it's my
operating mode of choice.

I guess I'm a perfectionist or something.. it just seems like "cheating"
somehow..  It does appear that code would be fascinating.. I got a
code drill for the coco a couple years ago.. you could read a file and
it would beep out the code..  I messed around with it a little bit, but
let it slide...

It does seem like it would be really great.

If I remember correctly, one of my friends' call letters is WA9UXQ (I think).
His name is Ron Camp.. Darn, forgot to get the frequency he usually
monitors but he is on most nights.. He doesn't do a whole lot of "ratchet
jawing" in the CB-ers terminology, but does like to talk.. You might
try to raise him if you'd like -- I'll try to think and get some
frequencies.

         This is an update to let you all know that the Nitros9
       conference orginally scheduled for this coming Monday will be
       pushed up to the following Monday, March 13th and this coming
       Monday we will have an Open Forum Conference, so if you want to
       talk about anything and everything, stop by this Monday for the
       Open Forum. My conference on the OS-9 UG Project that was to
       originally take place on the 13th will be postponed until sometime
       in April. Once I have the next schedule completed, I reannounce
       that one. Sorry about all the changes as of late, but this is a
       necessary evil. Hopefully the next schedule will be a bit more
       stable.

         Btw, it looks like my schedule at work is going to change
       sometime in the next couple weeks, and if that is the case the
       conferences, starting in April will be on Tuesday instead of
       Monday nights. Once I get the word, I'll let you know here to
       clarify...

Make very sure that the terminal program that you are using has TRUE VT100
emulation.  If it does not, the output that you see on your screen will be
full of extra characters.  In addition, make sure you enter the command /echo
host before you go to IRC.

I don't think any of the versions of Supercomm have true VT100 (check with
RANDYKWILSON here about this).  When I know that I want to surf the 'net or
use IRC or Telnet I defer to VTerm which is a fully-featured RS-DOS comm
program with true VT100 emulation.  It works perfectly.  However, there is one
VT100 emulator comm program  available for OS-9.  It is KBCOM downloadable in
the database here (search on VT100).  There is also a small standalone VT100
terminal emulator there called (appropriately) VT100.<grin>

Okay then, I'll have to download. I had VTerm but I believe I sold it. I'll

Since I got hooked(OS-9), I sold most of my RS-DOS software. I'll try the
KBCom version on the database. I'm desparate, I have a conference in the IRC
tommorrow morning at 11am. Meeting some old friends who never even touched
a computer when I knew them six years ago. Now they have PCs and Macs. I have
to upgrade soon, my coco is not keeping up. I just haven't decided which

I recommend buying a good PC and a BIG hard drive. It will run various
versions of UN*X, like Linux, which reminds me a lot of OS-9 (a lot of
boot-file compiling, and it supports window-swapping hotkeys, just like our
favorite OS!). A Mac is good for desktop publishing and it is easy to use,
but the PC is beginning to catch up. More and more people are buying PC's
every day, and I predict that at the rate they are selling, they will take
over the market completely in a matter of a few years. If you don't have one
you will be left in the dust! What you choose really does depend on what you
want to do with the thing. Anyway...

A PC is also suitable for OS-9000, which unfortunately cost about the
same as the MAC port.  If you win the lottery, you may see a PowerPC
version on a desktop machine next year.  Windows NT will soon be the

I got the same thing you got with the .lzh files.  My ident looked identical
to yours (same CRC). Looks like about the last 193 bytes in my module are
e5's. I used lha v2.06 so it isn't lha-specific.  Apparently we have
some glitched files..

  The `E5' is the byte that is used by Format on `osk' box's.
I also used lha 201, to 208 with the same results.  It will
extract the file but it is damaged :(

  For `grins' I used dEd on the file just to see what's there..
A lot of text then the `block' is filled with the E5's.

  Maybe Frank can upload just the `cbdemo' file again?  Frank???

Yeah, I figured the series of E5's was that..  Umm.. what's the diff
between 208 and 206 - worth changing?

I did "dump".  Do you have dEd for OSK?  If so, where'd ya get it?  I looked
here and on CI$ and couldn't find it, would like to have it...

How about chopping the file length to the point where the E5's
start?  Will Lha accept it?  Or, maybe do the chopping after
uncompressing, and then redo the CRC?  Just throwing some crazy
ideas your way....

Can someone tell me how to get a text pgm from a OS9 disk to a RS disk
while working in OS9?(g)

You can use the OS-9 utility called "rsdos" to transfer rsdos
text files to os-9 providing
you have the correct cc3disk installed at boot up time.  I
think cc3disk versions 10 and
11 will work.

Yep, I thinkn its here in the database too. What you want is "RSDOS", and
I think it comes with a companion proggy called (logically) "PCDOS" which
allows access to pcdos formatted diskettes too. AFAIK, the only caveats
have to do with the use of the "RAW" optionword, seems you've got to use
it, else weird text translations take place with pcdos. Oh, one other item,
I can't use them anymore without useing a special boot disk, the no-halt
controller does NOT support the mode used for the pcdos access, but I
think it works for the RSDOS thingy since both are 256 byte sector devices.
Cheers, Gene

I must have misstated the problem. I can read RSDOS from OS9 but not
OS9 from using RSDOS. Do you know of a method for this procedure?(g)

I'd love to hold a conference on my proposed OS-9 Global Clipboard
Library which is currently in beta-testing.  Could I have Monday, April
3rd reserved if it's still open?

     SCSI Host Adapter
     From: DAVID106     To: ALL

Hello,
  Is it still possible to get the Disto SCSI host adapters?  I have a
Quantum 105LPS drive laying around, and am very tired of running off floppies
anymore.  But my multipak interface currently has in its slots:

 1:  RS-232 Pak (radio shack)
 2:  dead, nothing works in that slot.
 3:  Disto 512K RamDisk
 4:  Disto Super Controller

So, I need a host adapter to go in one of those slots.  Would that be a
halting controller, like the floppy one is?  And can a Q105LPS be hooked up?
I seem to remember something about sector size? CoCo needs 256byte sectors?

Still dreaming of Linux...
                   Dave F.

Disto make a Scsi adaptor which plugs into the mini bus of their controller.
I forget if it works on the SController 1, certainly on the 2 and then you
get the no-halt feature.  Check out the 3 in one and 4 in 1 adaptors.  You
still need a Scsi controller.

Do you happen to know their address and/or phone number?  I'm surprised
anyone still markets anything for the CoCo's, really.

There is a lot of used equipment in the Fidonet OS9 echo for sale
or trade.  If what you have won't work out with the 4n1 board, maybe
you could arrange for a trade.  Your Quantum Scsi hard drive _has_
a controller built into it, it should plug right into the Disto
4n1 SCSI port.  I don't know the answer to your 256 byte/sector
question.  In fact, my Quantum papers don't show that part number.
  It does show the LPS105AT which is an IDE drive and that will NOT
work for you.  Oops, here is the LPS105S..105 MB, 205,561 logical blocks,
four heads, two platters, 64K of hardware cache.  Here is a phone number
for Quantum off of a 1993 pamphlet:  408-894-4000,  and a "900" number:
900-740-4433.

Hope this helps,

Yeah, that's the drive.  Hmm... 105M/205561 = 535.  Guess those host
adapters need 256 byte sectors?  Appearently I can't do it.

     Dave,

     I'd  like  to  note that most CoCo  hardware  (except  B&B's
mfm/rrl),  start  out  with 256byte sectors. But  nowadays,  it's
negotiable.
     Matt  Thompson released both a PD and commercial version  of
the  'scsisys'  hard  driver. Works with any disto, lr  tech,  or
Kenton.....  allows  specifing  512 or 256 byte  sectors,  has  a
cache, etc, etc (more etc in the commercial one, of course).
     With   a  neat  menu  driven  descriptor  maker,  _and_  OS9
formatter  included, it's a very nice package. I believe Northern
Xposure carries it?

  Just finishing up my Taxes for my CPA, then an annual Conservators
report,, time ran short in the last short month.  This month's UPGRADE
will be a 2 page hardcopy of pertinate information.
  But I doubt our members wil be dissappointed.
  As some of our members were pleasantly surprised receiving Software
packages with Doc's in December & Janurary.  A tad over 20 each month
and the response was great!  But still,,,  looking around my basement
is appx 120+ pieces of Original software of all types.
  Soooooo,, this month I'll pack 'em all up and when I run out of
those I'll just turn to the 100 or so system disks to fill out the
rest.
 Ya might say this month we had a drawing,,,
                                          "AND EVERYBODY WON"!
  Next month,,, sorry no more software just our usual Full disk issue.

Problems...


     I've recently started using Pete Lyall's cron, and seen some
strange  happenings-  enough  to wonder if there is  a  patch  or
different   version  I  _should_  be  using.   What  happens   is
occasionally  cronerrs  logs _everything_ and I mean  everything-
all  the text sent to the printer, for example. One day it logged
an entire tcom session, both ways, including an ASCII download.

     Or is it just me?

Yeah, it does have a problem. It eats its own working buffer due to not
having a seperate buffer for the input line AND the output line. If you
look around here, I've got at least one better version in the database,
that uses memory modules as data so it doesn't have to open a disk
file once a minute. The disadvantage of that is that it has to be re-
assembled each time you want to change something, but the scripts
included make that a piece of cake. It takes so. little cpu time that
you will not be able to detect that its running unless it has something
to really do, in which case it ups its own priority to 127 and gets
right along with it.
Are you ready to ship the 232 packs? I saw the note, btut right now,
tonight, delphiui has seen fit to disable the v32.bis line I did have
into here, and I'm for sure not going to fool around at 170 cps for
too long!
Cheers RickU, Gene Heskett

     Gene,

          Good to hear from you. Thanks for the crontip- I'll have
to stoke the old manual program again and go dbase surfing...

     Just  got  the  boards  today. Initial  testing  showed  the
expected  3  missing traces- after appling the  traditional  wire
wrap wire repair it seems I am just about ready to ship. Going to
let  this one burn a few days while duplicating paper/disks, with
no  smoke begin licking stamps Monday. The line is now 4 long and
I have 5 uarts in stock;-)

     Sounds  like you have my kind of luck- '...disconnected  the
fast line 3 days before the port came out.....'
