I need a set of source files to enable me to produce some graphics functions
for a bitmapped graphics adaptor. The functions I require are line drawing, box
drawing and character generation. The character generation needs to  use
various fixed and proportional pitch fonts of various sizes.
Does anyone know of any source code that is available to fulfil these basic
functions?

Hi All.... just dropping by to see what's new... I see nothing new here in the
past month... this place has really dried up!

No new 6809 uploads in weeks/months, only patches to existing osk software.
Very few new messages to read...

Anyway, just wanted to say hi, sorry for the complaining.

Jim,

Yup, things sure have slowed down here over the past few years.  Ahhh for the
"good 'ol days" when you logged in threee or four times a day just to be able
to keep up on the message traffic and see what new uploads were posted.  That's
when the sysops could get the time to enable them.....they were so busy.

I log in once or twice a week and I'm lucky to read 5 new messages now.  Oh
well, that's progess (I guess).

Take care

Bernard,

as far as I know, CD-I works with OS-9, called in this case CD-RTOS. However I
can't help you further, I'm a OS-9 programmer, but I hadn't anything to do with
CD-I programming yet.

Sb: OS-9 Ver 3.0 Bug
Fm: Paul N. Leonard 72477,774

                     ////// OS-9 Version 3.0 BUG //////

     The tsleep() function behaves differently in version 3.0 than
     it prior to version 3.0,  and the result is very intermittent
     and can lock up your task.  We had created  a  macro  called
     hard_tsleep() to insure that we slept for a specified period.
     It worked fine before we started using OS-9 ver. 3.0.

     In  OS-9  version 3.0  tsleep(1)  returns  1,  not  0!  This
     causes the first macro below to loop endlessly. If you do any
     sort of checking for tsleep returning 0, you may want to keep
     this in mind.

     /* original version, works under OS-9 prior to version 3.0 */ #define
hard_tsleep(T)    { unsigned l; l=(T); while ((l=tsleep(l))!=0); }

     /* new version, overcomes bug in OS-9 version 3.0 */ #define
hard_tsleep(T)    { unsigned l; l=(T); while ((l=tsleep(l)) >1); }
