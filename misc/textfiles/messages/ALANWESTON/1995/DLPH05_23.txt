Whoops Lv 2. actually.  I've seen Lv 3. or at least most of it up and running
at the last cocofest.  Needs a little work but I think it will be available as
a set of patches.

Actually, it is Level 2, Version 3.0... The "Mythical" Upgrade... Level 3
OS-9 was something done in Japan (from my understanding) and supported
virtual memory (using disk space as additional RAM). I've never seen
it, just heard rumors of it. I don't think anyone in the US has a copy of
it... I believe it ran on a 6809 system by Fuji...

  I would guess, that to get a true "Level 3", that these patches
would have to be done to the "out-of-box" OS-9 Level 2.  I have
done quite a lot of patching to get "MY" OS-9 to where it is to-
day.
  After having a bad hard drive crash some months ago, I had to
rebuild my whole boot.  The only backup I had was that of my
floppy boot days and it had very few patches done.  I now have a
backup boot, on floppy, that is identical to the boot on
this hard drive, with a few exceptions such as drivers and dis-
criptors.  I still have some tweeking to do such as when I am
online, I am getting lost characters again and I get "garbage"
characters now and then when text is being displayed.  I thought
I had the right comm driver and discriptors, or maybe it was some-
thing else that I did to fix this.  I have to make the time to
research my steps and fix it.  I suppose I could sacrifice watch-
ing Star Trek, but I do not like that idea so...

I kept a CONFIG_DIR on my hard drive that contained a complete MODULES
dir and all the good stuff, along with a few bootlists for different
applications.  In addition to this, I kept a backup of this on a floppy
disk.  That way, I could always os9gen a new boot disk..

Umm, from your message, it appears you boot from the HD.. but my method
should work, too..

Hi Dave,
  Yes, I do boot from my HD.  I hate waiting an hour (exageration) for
the CoCo to boot from floppy.  I do have a floppy that I keep custom
modules on but for some reason I never thought to save ALL of my mod-
fied modules as well.  I did have a backup boot for my           HD, on floppy
but I found that I could not boot from it, reason unknown.  I do have
a bootable backup of my current HD now, as a matter of fact, I boot
from it when I tried to get this RLL HD setup.  I am going to use the
RLL HD as an MFM and will keep a bootable floppy copy as well.  I am
going to save my modified modules to directory on it as well, maybe
even on a seperate floppy.  There IS something to be said for redun-
dancy, I guess!
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

I'd guess that you would have to have 2 seperate versions of the stuff that
goes on track 34 to get the different boots..  That's one reason I never
attempted to get a HD boot going.  Ummm.. when you say boot, you have your
OS9Boot on HD, too?  I did modify my stuff to look on the HD for the startup,
grfint, shell, etc.

Well, for the way my system (and probably everyone else's) is patched, I'd
hate to have to go back and recreate all the patches.  I don't think anyone
could get _too_ redundant on making backups of your config disk <G>

One other thing I did was that I kept a text file (UpDateLog or something)
that listed all the CRC's approximate insallation date, and short description
for each file (patched ones, at least) in my modules dir..

Then, too, I had PowerBoost, so I kept a 6809 Modules directory and a PBoost
modules directory...  and the list goes on  <hehe>

I don't think I had any problems like this when I installed it.  MV simply
does system read and write calls and wouldn't have any problem with what
kind of drive you are using.. You can go to floppies, HD's or ramdisk,
or whatever.

Just went to my coco and checked for error 21.. It says "Illegal Dimension".
This looks like a Basic09 error..

Is this error coming in when you try to run "os9gen"?  Ummm... did you also
change your "/dd" descriptor?  It accesses "/dd", so this could be your
problem.

 > Not sure just what I'm doing wrong.  Thanks in advance for any help.

Well, I'm sure you will get it worked out, but the problem is not in
M-V itself.  It's probably some little thing that is so simple you're
overlooking it.  Be sure your /dd is fixed, too.  This is a very good
possibility, although, you should have gotten a different error.

OK.. That sounds more like it.. Then it's looking for a file and not
finding it.  Is it showing this error on bootup?  Before you see any
OS9 command line or anything?  Usually, if startup errors, it just quietly
goes to the command line and says nothing, but whatever was supposed to
have happened after that error does not happen.

Error 216 means that it's looking for a file (program) that is not there.
You _DO_ have startup, on that disk??  For MultiVue, you need several files
and programs.  In your CMDS dir, you need "MULTISTART", "GSHELL", and
"CONTROL".  Also, if you have a copy of "MULTISTart" in the cmds dir,
with the filename "AUTOEX", then it will autoboot into M-V on startup.
Otherwise, you can include the command "multistart" as the last line of
startup.  If you don't have "autoex" in your cmds dir and want it, all you
have to do is chd to cmds and type "copy multistart autoex".  This will give
you an exact copy of "multistart" but will execute as soon as "startup" is
done.

One other file you need, and I would bet this is the one that is causing the
error... You need the file "env.file" in your SYS directory.

 > Still haven't got it going on 40d.dd is it

Sure.  Just type "multistart"..  But I don't think this is the cause of your
problem.. You have one or more files missing.

If you don't have the file env.file in your SYS directory (it is on the
distribution disk), if you have the docs, there is a listing for that file
in there.  You can input it with any text editor.  You might want to change
a few things.  It specifies how much memory you have, what disk devices you
have, custom palette colors, printer specs, and several other things.

Thanks David.
Yes I have the docs for MV, original and unopened in the shrink wrap yet. The
problem comes in when I try to create a new boot disk from the MV disks.
It puts the first file name on the screen and then errors with #216.  The
second file in bootlist.mv is init, I checked and it's in there.  Oh and
I did change the env.file to 512K.

Do you mean you get this error when running "os9gen"?  Are you doing this
straight with os9gen or are you using "config" (or whatever that name is...).
I never did use it.  I always used os9gen.  If you are getting this error
using os9gen, then you probably have one of your filenames not correct for
what you have in your directory.

 > The second file in bootlist.mv is init, I checked and it's in there.

Is it init that it's not finding?  Do you have it with a different filename
and in the correct directory?  Remember that os9gen is looking for a filename,
not necessarily a module name.  What I did was put all my boot modules in
one MODULES directory.  Like, when I got MV, I copied all those modules to
the directory with the rest of the modules.

One thing  you might do.  If os9gen is bombing on you..  You should have
a file on your new disk, probably "tmpboot".  Do an "ident -s" on that
file and see exactly what modules have been included.  You mention filenames
being echoed to the screen.  I can't remember this, but maybe so.. Oh, if
it puts one filename on the screen, then this first one may be the one
that it can't find..  and I suspect it _is_ this first one... check your
filenames.  Your ident will tell you.  Whatever the next filename after
the last one is the culprit.

An RLL as an MFM? ubetcha! I'm doing exactly that at the office right
now, useing a clapped out St-238r as an ST-225. The only diff there in
fact was that the 238 had plated disks which were supposedly better
quality. In use, they aren't, I have 2 of them around and they both
couldn't keep a fat table intact for a month on a million dollar bet!
One was in a pc, and one was on my coco for several years. I'm usning
the old pc drive as the second drive on my office coco, and alltho its
mainly for a backup image, so far in a month it hasn't lost anything
as an MFM drive. Its got some bad sectors marked out, something the
pc utils wouldn't let me do, but the coco can! If you can get the 85 megger,
that would be ideal. I've collected nearly everything around here, plus
I try to maintain all versions of whatever I've written and still have
only about 60 megs of this Maxtor 7120s in use. If I lose this drive,
I'm dead as there isn't a good way to back it up that doesn't take 2
days to do. I'd love to be able to just network it overe to the amiga
where I could back it off to a videotape in 2 hours or less.
I've given thought to attempting that on the coco, but its screen updates
are 50x slower. And no real way to get the data back into it at that
speed either.
Something will turn up in due time though.

Hello Gene,
  Well, I think the 85 Megger is no longer available.  The 386
was not up to snuff for use as a server so the boss opted for a
dedicated server and the 386 will be used as one of the worksta-
tions.  I guess I will try to use this RLL as an MFM and see where
that will lead me.  It is quite a shame that an IDE cannot be
interfaced with the CoCo.  Although,  I just had another thought,
maybe I should look into going SCSI.  That is a doer!  Problem
is I would hate to just "throw away" my XT interface with all the
$$$, time and sweat I put into it for the past few years.  Then
again, I could spend some more $$$ and get this ST-238 fixed.  The
darned thing will not hold is speed.  Spindle comes up then just
stops spinning.  I really like the ST-238, much faster than this
clunky old ST-225.  Quieter too!  Oh well, I am getting closer to
having my 486 up and running.  I could just use it, online, in the

Tell ya what Gene, the 238 and 225 are identical drives EXCEPT for the
platter coating! The 238 will run as mfm just fine, I'm doing it. I converted
to scsi a year back or a bit more now on my coco, and it was the best thing I
ever did for it. The RLL setup was always in need of file repairs due to
miss-writes covering up already allocated disk area. That was due to some
thing in the interface that would, about once a day, return a sector full
of zero's when the FAT was being read in its search for free disk space.
I changed the controller card from a WD1002-27x to a Seagate St-11r with only
minimal effect on the problem. ALL of the problems went away when I changed
over to a SuperController II with a 4n1. The B&B I had/have was an earlier
all black one which may have had something to do with it. I have a later
Gold colored one at the office merrily running a 10 meg Tandon and a 238 as
a 20 megger in the mfm mode. No mistakes of that nature have ever been made
on THAT system by that setup. It has the MFM version of the ST-11 controller
in it.
If that older B&B was a problem, I would have expected Chris to advise me
of it, but in all our talks, he never said it could be a problem. I was
probably one of the first 10 or so he sold!
Me, I'd go for the scsi myself. On that system (I'm on the amiga at the
moment) I now get a megaread time of 13 seconds! The B&B started out at
71 seconds, and with some fine tuning got down to 49 seconds, but even with
the early pbooster or nitros9, never went any lower. The speed I got from
the scsi using the registerd scsisys2.1 makes all the $ well spent IMO.

Hello Gene,
  Thanks for the info.  I have allocated time this afternoon to set
the 238 up as an MFM.  I may seriously think about SCSI!  Our dedi-

impressed with the speed.  You may find this hard to believe, I do,
but the server is a DX/33Mhz and it seems to be faster than the
486DX2/66Mhz that I am using right now.
  Right now, all we have is an old 386DX/25Mhz networked to the
server and it seems to access much faster than it did when networked
to my DX2/66.  But then, we were running Novel Personal Netware, now
we have Netware 3.1, (a real network software).  I will keep you

  Did you make a directory on /dd called `samples' (just in case) ?
That's the only thing I can think of at the moment...

  I just put all exec. files in cmds, made the /dd/samples directory
and put the sound files there.  The first time I called it, I used
the redirection thing..  `linkup <>>>/w&' and I was sitting at /dd
also.  Other than that, I don't know :(

Hi Chris,
  I do not know about the rest of the country, or world for that mat-
ter, but, here in San Diego, Ca. there is a yearly Computer/Software
Expo that is put on by the S.D. Computer Society and a leading compu-
ter magazine publishing company.  They have exhibit booths with MAJOR
computer/software/etc. companies displaying their wares.  Our own
OS-9 Users Group has a booth set up to display/demonstrate all flavors
of OS-9.
  I went to the one last year and saw that there were quite a number
of people observing and or asking questions about OS-9.  This goes on
for 4 days, at least it will this year.  I only went last year because
I found out that OS-9 was going to be there.  I am not very active in
the group (what with time constraints and whatnot), but I will be
there again this year as a "spectator".
  I think this would be an excellent way to get OS-9 into the minds
of the masses.  If they can see what OS-9 can do, right along side of
MS-DOS, I think they may become more interested.  At least those who
do not rely on WINDOSE to do there work for them.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

LONG LIVE OS-9! <FOREVER> ** In whatever form it is in!

 Agreed. Hopefully we will be able to get OS-9 represented in many more
 future computer shows(besides JUST the Cocofests). We need to get a
 list of annual shows compiled(part of the sourcebook), and then maybe
 develope some sort of promotional compaign that can be in use at the fests.
  I agree, it is a great way to get our foot in the door, and would love to

True story, as far as it goes.  But sales are still made at OS-9 only fests,
not mixed fests.  Advance marketing, as full a vendor attendence as
possible, and no outside competetion are going to be key factors in building
the sales from the existing market, in order to have the revenue to grab
attention of people outside the current OS-9 users base.  We have to work at
both, and I see lots of attention to getting new users, but little work to
lay the financial groundwork necessary to pay for the marketing work.

The letter A, B, C indicates the maximum clock speed the chip is rated for.
C = 3 MHz, so it should run just fine with the (slightly under) 2 MHz clock

 I've been here before! My VCDP has a CRC of $AE0F14. BUT, the problem I
 had was that my MM1 I/O board had an early Western Digital SCSI chip,
 not revision A, and I had to change my chip before I could use VCDP. You
 must have revision A of that SCSI chip for VCDP to work.

 I forgot to say that not only the revision of the chip (need revision A)
 but also the mask number is critical. Apparently the MM1 was designed
 around mask #2 or mask #4 of the prototypes of that Western Digital
 SCSI chip. In the Amiga World they refer to these as PROTO versions of
 the chip because PROTO is printed on it. So having the right chip to
 work with VCDP requires the WD33c93 revision A, mask #2 or mask #4,
 with PROTO also printed on the chip. My machine was a Paul Ward MM1
 to and the SCSI chip was not revision A and  therefore minus a few
 instructions that VCDP needs.

 Randy,
         Where does one look to find the production number of their MM1?
I happen to have one that was originally won in a raffle by a lady (from
Tennesee I think) at a CocoFest in Atlanta when the MM1 was first introduced.
David Myers (CoCoPro fame) later bought the machine from her and I bought it
from David. Later I bought the I/O board from someone named Colin in Oklahoma
who had bought an early Paul Ward MM1. This assortment of circuity has
worked perfectly for years now with the exception of my needing to replace
that WD33c93 (no revision A) chip. I guess I'd just like  to know something
more about the historical lineage of these pieces!

  Mine is SN 120877, so it might have the right chip. I still need to take
the top off and look. If it is the right chip, then all I need is to replace
my SCSI_MM1D ED #25 with ED #27.
  Thanks for the info. BTW RIBBS_OSK is doing real well. Contact Warren and
he has his up and running each night from 5 to 9 PM PDT. I can provide you
with a BETA disk. We are on the verge of having real FIDO net mail. When
we do and is reliable, then Warren plans to switch to RIBBS_OSK. It is
running with LOCK baud support. Bill Chapple figured out how to use the
DTR line on the uarts to hang up the bbs. A bunch of people got copies at
Chicago Fest. We had two MM/1's running, with one with RIBBS_OSK at 38400
baud locked and the other running KTerm V3.0. Real impressive. Warren and
I have been looking at interfacing RIBBS_OSK and UUCP for Internet Access.
It works until you logoff UUCP, then it locks up. Calvin Dodge thinks the
problem is in "checkcd". He has done a fantastic job with the assembly code.
Ribbs_OSK is real stable. Under normal operating, it has yet to bomb with
a 103 or 102 error. If it does error, it has always recycled. TTY,ANSI, &
OS9 modes are working great.
  If you get a chance call Warren's BBS durning the evening and see the
fruits of all our labors.

Not in that quantity I'm afraid. In this case, I think I'd be tempted to
contact the author of the driver and see if he could bring it up to later
standards. Or share the source with someone who really does breath the
scsi1 and scsi2 language. The earier chip did have some bugs, in fact
the inside front cover of the AA I got today has an add for (an ex GVP empl)
latest revision of the scsi.device rom with workaraounds for all known
variations of that chip. So it can be done. I wish I had better advice
David. Can you spec the exact version you need to the wholesalers and
convince them that later versions just won't fly in this app? There might
be a few laying around, and its one of those projects that will blow the
fone budget all to he!!. I know, I've done that a couple of times finding
the exact item I needed there at the station. I've got one chip I think,
lemme check it. Its on an A2090a commie hd board I took out. The scsi on
this board is considered unusable by most, but thats more the rom version
than the chip I think, it didn't support any "scsi direct" commands, an
item that MUST be fully implemented if a cdrom is ever going to work.
The chip on this board is: WD33C93-PL on the second line, has an "85 date
on the top line with line 3=00-02 8736
This one shared space with a KONAN MFM controller and was supposed to be
able to handle 2 MFM drives and 5 scsi drives. As I said, few ever made the
scsi work, and the commie folks themselves say even the latest rom they
have for it isn't worth the effort to plug in. But you are welcome to it
if you can use that revision. This one doesn't say "PROTO" anywhere on it.

 David,

     When I went looking for a replacement chip for my WD33c93 chip I
posted on USENET to Amiga groups and got 6 offers of people willing to
sale me the needed WD33c93A mask #2 or mask #4. They had upgraded SCSI
controllers (to deal with larger capacity HDs in some cases) and were
happy to unload the PROTO chips for around $10-15. I installed a
socket and things work fine.

Unforch, those quotes (or unquotes) are from hints and tips passed on
over in the Ami forum and usenet over the last year. The general consensus
seems to be that the only clean chip in the lot has a -08 on the end, but
that it may in turn require later versions of "scsi.device", the driver
software thats normally part of the card/eprom for the scsi interface.
As I said, mine is early, 40 pinner, and between it and the early eproms,
it is crash city if you try to run a cdrom with it, and normally locks
up the buss requireing a reboot hourly or more often.  The lockups can
happen in mid-write, leaving the drive invalidated, a major headache to
clear at times. We've even had to format and start all over!  Price?
Make me an offer in my mailbox here. Cheers david, gene

       information important within the OS-9 community. The purpose of
       this project is to help keep a centralized source of information
       for people from many ends of the OS-9 world, while preventing
       fragmetation of the this ever changing community. As the
       information is gathered and the sourcebook begins to grow, we, the
       User's Group, will be able to use it as our information foundation
       and as a springboard for launching future projects more quickly,
       as less time will have to be spent gathering information related
       what we will be working with. As a sidenote, I am already planning
       future UG projects that will rely on this very sourcebook.

         Technically, this will not be a hardcopy 'book', as the title
       might have you believe, although any queries coming in from US
       Mail(snail mail) will be answered with the resulting data being
       mailed on paper of course.

         As this will be a permanent, ongoing project we expect that more
       topics will be added in the future, as we get feedback from the
       membership, but these are categories that will be collected first
       to get the sourcebook started:

         USERLIST:  This will contain names of individuals like you and
       me who use OS-9 for any purpose. A form will be added in the
       following post for users to fill out and return at the appropriate
       address(below). Whether you use it at home or at work or wherever,
       we want your name added to this list so we can keep EVERYONE in
       touch. It is especially important that we get the names of people
       who don't have the benefit of a modem or an Online service. If you
       know someone in your area who fits this criteria, please let them
       know what is going on, and have them send the information
       requested in the form!

         Local Clubs and User Groups:  Small regional clubs in the OS-9
       world sometimes go on unheard of even by people IN THEIR AREA, let
       alone in the national online scene. If you are a member of such a
       group please fill out the form that will be posted in the near
       future(all forms will also be in the MOTD for people to mail in
       through US Mail). It is the intent of the UG to help keep members
       and clubs plugged in to eachother and avoid dwindling membership.
       A future project will tackle this issue.

         Bulletin Board Services,Online services, and Internet sites:
       Well these will actually be three seperate databases, but you
       probably already get the idea on these. It will be similar to many
       other independently kept BBSlists, but will be kept more up to
       date and will serve as the official OS-9 BBS database.

         Publications:  All OS-9 related Magazines and newsletters.

         Vendors:  If you run a business selling OS-9 Products or
       services, we will be able find customers for you and you for the
       customers that are looking!

         Business' working with OS-9:  If you are a business that uses
       OS-9 within the workplace, including those in our large industrial
       marketplace, we will have an entry form released for you also!

         These are the categories that we will begin with. Keep in mind
       this sourcebook is going to grow with time and input from the OS-9
       community. Once the initial categories are built up, we do plan to
       add an 'Orphanware' topic, but that will be saved for later,due to
       the amount of work it may take to collect all that software.

         You do NOT have to be a member of 'The OS-9 User's Group' to be
       placed in the the sourcebook, but you are of course encouraged to
       become a member and become involved in the future of OS-9. Being
       included in the sourcebook does NOT oblige you to do anything as
       it is a service to the community.

         The entry forms for each category will be individually posted
       online within a short time of eachother. 'The OS-9 User's Group'
       will print each one following the MOTD updates. The first one, to
       be included in the following post, will be the Userlist entry
       form. The next one to appear within a few weeks will be the BBS
       entry form, which Sysops should be aware of.

OS-9 for the ST is 150 pounds sterling from Cumana in the UK.... about
$200-$250. Little support though. Some SCSI systems for the Atari don't seem
to work well with the supplied drivers either.

OK, I stand corrected <G>.. Seems like there's SOME platform that OS9 costs
that much, though, isn't there?

Anyway, I would be a little hesitant to try to do anything serious with an
Atari with the Cumana system..  You would probably have lots of things to work
out, and support would be a little uncertain, IMO.

We also found a loose part in the rear brakes, which put more of the
stopping effort on the front disks (something I added to the car later...
didn't have those in '63!), and was a definate factor in causing the front
wheel lock-up that actually caused the accident in the first place. Had an
uneventful trip back to Georgia from Chicago.

I took a couple extra days off work when I got back. went down to my dad's
house in South Carolina (4 hour trip), met with some old friends, then took
a fender off a parts car I have there. You don't decide to drive a 30 year
old car on a daily basis unless you know you have repair parts available!
Replaced the damaged fender AND totally rebuilt the rear brakes just because
I had the time and was able to get the new parts locally. Now EVERYTHING
works just great!

All that's left to do is get the thing painted. Unfortunately, while Chicago
was a good trip again, it wasn't quite THAT good! So I'll be driving around
with a faded pink-looking fender for a while. I WAS able to pay for all
other repairs... about $250 including the brakes (biggest expense was
radiator)... and all expenses though. Maybe Atlanta will be good enough for
a paint job.....   Of course, I'll accept all donations.... ;>

     Ghostscript ver 3.33
     From: JOHNREED     To: ALL

Ghostscript version 3.33 should appear soon in the new uploads
database.

For those who are not familiar with it, Ghostscript is a
Postscript emulator written by L.Peter Deutsch, of Aladdin.
It allows you to display (with a proper driver) and print
Postscript files on just about any decent printer.  With
Ghostscript and the TeX system uploaded by Tim Kientzle,
users can produce documents using just about any font
you can imagine, include graphics, colors if your printer
can do it, design your own letterhead or company logo,
print your own forms, etc.

The following is the "readme.1st" file included in
the upload.
***
Ghostscript version 3.33 was released in April 1995 by Aladdin.

I have ported version 3.33 to OS-9/68000 on the MM/1, and put
together a collection of the files needed to run it, with an
assortment of fonts and demos.  Except for the "kwin" Kwindows
driver, it SHOULD run on any OSK machine.

The complete source, and compiled binaries for MSDOS and some
other systems can be found on ftp.cs.wisc.edu /ghost/aladdin.

This release carries a different Copyright notice than earlier
GNU/FSF releases.  Its in the file called "public".  Read it.

Quick summary of new features since the last version I posted
(version 2.6.1) :  (for a full description of all
changes in recent versions, see files "news", "current", and
"history".)

Reads Adobe PDF (Acrobat) format files.
Reads JPEG files.
 Had a few confusing moments with the JPEG reader -- it bombed
 on the test files supplied with the JPEG-5A lib.  Then I tried
 the "jpegshow" program recently uploaded to DELPHI -- it said
 the files I was trying to read were defective (?!!).  Downloaded
 a couple other JPEG files and found both "jpegshow" and Ghostscript
 read them just fine.
Full Postscript Level II support.
No GIF output -- previous versions would convert a Postscript
 file to a GIF - this has been dropped by the author to avoid
 any possible legal difficulties due to a copyright or patent
 claim on the compression method used in GIF files.  The
 author of Ghostscript, L. Peter Deutsch of Aladdin, posted
 an explanation in comp.lang.postscript.

The Kwindows display driver in this compiled version has a slightly
bigger display - you can read smaller fonts on the screen - and some
improvements in speed in some of the graphics routines.

The printer drivers now send their output to "/p" by default - use
the "-sOUTPUTFILE=<path>" switch in the command line to change it.

In order to keep it small enough to run on a 3-meg computer, I have
NOT included the "debug" features and I picked an assortment of
output drivers that I hope will cover most users.  Apologies to those
I left out. The output drivers included in this version are:

        kwin deskjet djet500 epson epsonc eps9mid eps9high ibmpro
        st800 ap3250 laserjet ljetplus ljet2p ljet3 ljet4 cdeskjet
        cdjcolor cdjmono cdj550 pj pjxl pjxl300 bj10e bj200
        dfaxhigh

If you want to run Ghostscript, and your printer is not (and cannot
emulate) one of the above, let me know.  Maybe I could post some other
versions with different drivers.  (Or in individual cases -- mail a
disk). ((johnreed@delphi.com))

The program passed my 3-meg test (make a 6+meg ramdisk to tie up
memory and try to run it).  There was not a lot of room to spare.

Have fun.

Is one close to Epson ESC/P2?  (would epsonc be it?).

RE Ghostscript 3.33 drivers for Epson ESC/P2.

 the epsonc driver is for 24-pin color printers.

 the ESC/P2 driver now defines TWO drivers, st800 and
 ap3250.  They are about the same, except for the
 pre-defined margins.  Use the st800 for inkjets, and
 the ap3250 for "Action Printer xxx".

From the OS9 side, it would take modifications to Boot, CC3Go, Init, and
possibly your StartUp. I have no idea what it would take from the DECB
side. You'd have to get the "DOS" command code to look at the new drive.

I found that if I "dir 2" in DECB with the OS9 Boot disk in drive 2, then
wait for the File Structure error - OK -, and then DOS... I get the OS9
Boot screen. After a short while it move to /d0.

I just for starters Dmoded all Drive discriptors to be /d2 and then moved
them to the front of the BootFile. I figuered it would take a few patches
to Boot or Init but the next question would be what are the patches or
where could I locate them?

For Init and CC3go, you will just have to change all occurances of /d0 to /d2.
Boot is a different animal. It directly accesses the hardware. You would
have to patch the point it selects drive 0 to select the drive you want.
I do not know exactly where this is, or how to do it. Sorry.

I don't have any assembly knowledge or access to a assembler/dissasembler.
As far as viewing the module(s) in a disk zapper...I haven't looked yet
but I doubt that I could do anything. I just thought that someone had
done these patches along the way and had actual patch data. While reading
the description of a file in the data base, it was mentioned that some
people patch modules to boot from hard drive. Being that a descriptor is
a descriptor, maybe the conversion would be minimal. ???

Thanks anyway!

Is there any particular reason?  You would have to patch your Boot module,
but then you would be stuck.  I think some of the disk roms support
something like dos 2, and I think if you issue the command drive 2, then
if you immediately type "DOS", then it will initially access that drive,
I guess it loads your kernel, but then Boot takes over and tries to read
drive 0.

Unless there were some good reason, it doesn't seem worth the effort.

     RE: Booting from another drive (Re: Msg 92604)
     From: DOMM         To: DBREEDING

Actually, the reason I'd be interested in doing this is because I recently
added a 3.5" disk drive to both my CoCo setups. My choice was to make it
(on both systems) Drive 2 because that way I could keep all the 5.25 boot
disks as they are rather than changing everything. With 720k, I would use
the 3.5's as storage/work disks. Now, however, if I could get an 80 track
disk to boot from Drive 2 (the 3.5), I could have a larger Boot Disk to
work with when necessary. (It's not really a necessity but just a thought.)

I,ve tried doing a "Drive 2" then "DOS" . Doesn't seem to work. What does
work though, is doing a "DIR" on the os9 disk while in RSDOS. Then wait for
the File Structure error and "OK" cursor.A "DOS" after that does bring up
the boot screen (which then goes to /d0).

I've since played around with looking at the modules with kwikzap and have
been able to locate a couple of places in INIT and CC3go where I substituted
"D2" for anything resembling a drive descriptor. (h0,d0,dd)
On the Boot module, there only seems to be one spot "D0", so I changed
that to d2 also. It still doesn't boot, but does seem to stay on drive
2 while booting. (actually it does flash to drive 0 and back to Drive 2
at one point but doesn't stay at drive 0 even with no disk in it.

It seems close to working but not knowing exactly what I'm doing is kind
of a hinderance. <g>

STD..40 track to 3.5" and used it for DOS and Os9........

drive 1 was a 40 track......Drive 2 was an 80 track 5.25"
I could use the 3.5" as a 80 track DOS disk...D0/D2...front/back
and a full Double sided 80 track in os9...bootable!
and to copy to it..I used an 80 track RAMDISK..ala Ext-ADOS-3...to move stuff
back and forward.....Has worked for me now for a number of years!

all it takes is a single pole double throw switch..or a double pole,double throw

.if one want an indicator LED...........


         D0 select line   > o    o >LED-------X------B+

         MAIN D0 line <Car> o    o >470 ohm resistor to ground!

  Second D0 select line   > o    o >LED-------X------B+

     From: RANDYKWILSON To: DOMM

Dom,

 First lets go through a quick-n-dirty os9 boot, coco style.

 1> You type "dos". The DECB rom code reads track 34 of the floppy, loads it
    into memory, and executes the code at a set point.

 2> The execute point is REL. REL moves the loaded code into high memory, and
    jumps into the kernel; os9p1.

 3> The kernel takes a look around and can't find his usual cronies. So the
    Kernel calls BOOT.

 4> BOOT knows nothing about DECB or OS9 disk structures. It only knows to look
    at one given point to find out where to start reading, and how much. This is

    why OS9Boot files must be contiguous. Effectively boot loads Os9Boot.

 5> Now the kernel is happy, grabs some defaults from Init, and executes CC3go.

 There are, as has been mentioned, three points that need to be fixed to use
another drive as boot. You apparently have found a way around the first one;
the DECB dos command. The third one is simple. Patch the drive/device names in
Init and CC3go. It's the second one that is a problem.

 "Boot" is nothing more than a very dumb loader program. It is hard coded, very
hard coded, to the coco disk controller, drive 0. At the point boot is running,
DECB is gone, but OS9 hasn't started yet. There are no descriptors, or drivers,
or managers. It's boot's job to load the file containing them.

 While I do know asm, I do not know how to program/control the floopy
controller. If we could come up with sufficient data on drive select, it should
be possible to form a patch.

 Many people claim to boot from a hard drive. Some just patch CC3Go and Init so
that the process starts on a floppy; the enter boot comes from floppy; then
continues on the hard drives. some people, me included have replaced their
boot module with a different one so that most of the boot comes from the
hard drive. A few have replaced everything including the DECB rom to boot
totally from a hard drive. Only the first, least effective, is done with
patching.

That makes sense.  However, if you really wanted to make your 3.5's boot
disks, I believe the best way would be to make your 3.5 drive 0.  You have
to modify your Boot module.  This is why right now it is going back to
0 each time.  I don't know if it would be any hassle if you set the 3.5 as
drive 0 down the road or not.  All you would have to do would be to copy
all your boot disks to 3.5's.. Actually, if you don't have a HD, I would
suggest getting 2 3.5's for one of your computers.  You would want to keep
at least one 5.25 for compatibility.

A "d0" in the "BOOT" module is not a reference to d0 (I don't think).  It
is a strictly m/l program that does a raw load of your os9boot file from
disk.  You will need to gain a knowledge on disk controller commands to do
this.  IMO, it would just not be worth it.

 > It seems close to working but not knowing exactly what I'm doing is kind
 > of a hinderance. <g>

I know what you mean there!  Again, I think It would be much easier to just
set your 3.5 as drive 0.  If you do this, you may need a few pointers to do
this.. I'm not sure exactly what you have to do to get this completed.  I
think you have to first connect a 3.5 as drive 1 or 2, then make a boot disk
on it, with d0 as the 3.5, then switch your drives and boot from this..

Again, 2-3.5's would be a good setup.

You've given me the "whats happening" step by step knowledge that is

about it. In a way, it's too bad that I seem to be on the right track
on "two points" out of three because I hate to give up on anything.

my quest for a drive 2 boot is a little out of reach.

At this point any way, I believe you are right about the easiest and
least complicated way to boot from the 3.5 is to make it drive 0.
Right now however, I would have to change a lot of disks over and there
is this saying thats seems appropriate:
("If it ain't broke - don't fix it!")

I have two Coco setups with two 5.25s and one 3.5 apiece. Also, I have
five 5.25s waiting in the wings in case of trouble. If I were to change
over to a 3.5 format, I'd have to change alot of stuff. ($$$)

I've learned a lot though! Thanks!

Dom,

 Definately not out of reach. But it may be a lot more trouble than it's
worth. The next step would be to procure the control information for the
coco floppy controller. I believe the info needed is about the register
at addr $FF40, but am not totally sure. Then the code to Boot would have
to be examined and a patch strategy laid out. It *may* be a simple, one
byte, patch. Or it may require extensive logic modifications to keep
other portions of the code from stomping on the drive 2 select.

THATS GREAT! I still can't get it to boot though.?? What was the description
of the floppy info in the defsfile? I'll have to look this over a while to
make sure I have the changes correctly in place. Gut feeling however says
what I did - I did. Whether or not I need to change something else or what,
I don't know.

So far, I patched Init and CC3go to /d2 descriptors. Init has been patched
to get CC3go in /d2/cmds. Also patched boot with your modpatch file.

While I'm rechecking, any thoughts???

Well...so far it still won't boot (Boot Fail). I did all the patches
over, reformated /d2 to 40 tracks, made a new boot disk with changes..
including /dd set to drive 2 and making sure /dd and d2 are 40 track.

It does stay firmly on drive 2 when the boot screen is present though.

I changed two places in CC3go from /H0 to /D2.
I changed one place in INIT from /dd to /d2.

One place I might question is in the init. The sequence goes:"(.-Init.CMDS/
CC3go/dd/TermBoot..M"
Now, I changed the /dd to /d2 only. May be this should be done differently?

At least now - It stays steady on drive 2 and gets all the way to Boot Fail.


Any sugestions???

Dom,

 At the moment, my coco is not running, so I can't verify this. I do believe
that the strings in Init and CC3go should have the high bit set on the last
char.  If this is true, the /d2 in init should be (hex) 2F 64 B2. Same thing
for the spot in CC3go that used to be /H0, not /H0/cmds. In reality, the
two /h0 strings in cc3go could stay unmolested. That's where it *attempts*
to switch over to the hard drive. If it errors (no hard drive or /h0) it
shrugs and continues with the current floppy. :>

Well, not a lot, would there?  You'd just have to put all your boots
onto your 3.5's, and perhaps any other data disks that had to be in

 My CoCo is only partially working. As such I can not test anything. I do
have some coco disasm's on the mm/1, including boot. With the info found
in FDDefs (programmers db), I found three points in the code that set the
base value of FF40. From those bases, it appears to "or" in the needed
control bits. The mod patch I gave should change those three bases. No
guarantees. I've never messed with raw floppy i/o before. :>

WELL-WELL-WELL--- I think we're gettin there! I finally got the thing to BOOT!
I'm having a little trouble during "startup" where at one point I have a list
of "Display" changes to different windows.(Seems to jam and slowly gives the
seek error #247 repeatedly. This could be related to something with merging
because I was getting that situation at a different point where I was sending
GUIB graphic boxes to some windows. I changed my startup line where I was
merging stdfonts from /d0 to /dd and got this. I then changed /dd to /d2 and
that
situation cleared up. I'm not sure at this point though.)

At this point, what I did was change back to the original CC3go with its
H0 descriptors and placed it back within the boot. Changed back the Init
to get CC3go in the boot and changed as you sugested , 2F 44 32 to 2F 64 B2.
The 32 to B2 change, is the differance it seems.(44=D 64=d probally doesn't
matter). Is this the high bit set on the last character?

What I'll do now is to change my boot disk back to what I had before with
CC3go in CMDS and go from there.

SO FAR SO GOOD!

 Yah, 44=D and 64=d; OS9 doesn't care about that in this situation. The high
bit set is indeed the B2 raather than 32. Normal ascii is in the range of
00 to 7F; a seven bit standard. Rather than using/wasting another byte to
mark the end of a string like Basic09 (FF) and C (00), OS9 internals often
use the high (eigth, unused) bit as a flag. Setting the high bit effectively
adds $80 to the chars value.

I think it's a "go"!

I made a 80 track boot off of Drive 2, with CC3go in CMDS. I'm still having
trouble at a certain spot of my startup but if I take that section out -
everything seems OK.

The boot disk in question is a little complicated so just to see I made a
40track boot disk of an editor disk I have. Once the changes have been done,
seems to boot off of drive 2 without any problems.

Do you think this information should be posted or what?
(Maybe a little more trying out is in order?)

 My CoCo went south.. well even farther south.. about the same time RickU
informed me Fast232 was a solid go. At first I thought I was having
software problems. Finally, I determined that my MPI was dieing... at
which time it went totally.

 Thanks to the kindness of John Wainright (JOHNREED), I now have a partial
CoCo that I can bring up for testing as needed. Not easily, though. Keyboard
and m/b connector are gone.... replaced with a ribbon cable and db25. I
have to jam an old keyboard mylar up against the  ribbon solder points
steady enough and long enough to type "dos". :> John's old system was
obviously well and lovingly used.

 I have also located another MPI. So, since I really do all my CoCo
software development and assembling on the mm/1, and the coco is used
for testing, I ought to be set for another ten years or so. :>

Well, to tell the truth, that sounds about what I had - well still have them.
Especially before I got my HD, I had a standard boot disk, a C boot, a
B09 Boot, a MV boot, and so on, and so on.  After getting my HD, of course
I didn't have to have so many.. I actually just kept this one disk in
maybe a couple other instances.  But I still kept most of my disks.
Actually, I should not have kept so many, but I always wanted to keep
myself on the safe side.

Yeah, that is a point, but of course you can use just about any floppy
drive.  I guess you are aware that you can use 1.44 drives, too, in
case you have to buy one and would like to have something to put into
another computer. All you have to do is just always use the DD disks, and
not use the HD ones..

As for floppy drive life, I still have the same 5.25's I bought some
10-12 years ago..   Wish my modems and printers would hold up that well <G>

Yes, I saw your post previously.  Did you find a modified Boot module or
did you modify it yourself?  I think I have the disassembled source code
for Boot, somewhere.  Had intended on looking for it, and see if I could
fix it, but if you have it working there's no need, I guess.

Humm, its a later mpi I take it. I spose, but then again, I'd be surprised
if the shack couldn't supply it once we figure out the part number assigned
to it *today*. It isn't so big that it couldn'tcome off destructivly which
would make the replacement a whole bunch easier. As in using an exacto
or ? to slice thru the leads near the body, then bulk remove the leftovers
with some solder-wick. Wash it up and plant the new one. Sounds like a
walk in the park from this end. In any event, don't toss it. Its like
dirt, they don't make any new dirt. Dirt, as in real estate. They aren't
making any new mpi's either. I have a manual, and can look it up if that
would help.

     chd's in ftp
     From: DBREEDING    To: ALL

Is there some command to toggle the case of your characters while in
an ftp site?  I just was at chestnut, tried to get into OSK sub.  My
characters were echoed in uppercase (the directory was in u/c), but it
returned "osk" in lowercase and said no such directory..  The only dir
I could access was 6809 it was first one, but no alpha characters, so
I suspect chestnut was getting lowercase, or interpreting it as such.

I may have a text file about this, will check.

Thanks

Thanks, Paul, CARL_D also told me... If I knew it, I had lost the info..

I thought I tried it, but apparently not.

I want to try and see if the versions of zip/unzip are more up-to-date
than mine..  I need this pair for QWK packets, and I believe the ones I
have (Zip 1.0, 29 Sept 1991 and unzip 5.0 21 Aug 1992) are trashing my
directories..  I posted this once and someone (BROWN80?) said he didn't
think we had any better versions, but I want to give it a shot.

I don't feel safe using zip any more... may do my reading from floppy,
but that will be slow.. and more inconvenient..

It seems that the darn thing is writing right over other files, writing
its data over the other file's data and allocating the bitmap for itself,
and when the file is deleted, the bitmap for the original file is also
deallocated (but the data is garbaged anyway.

I have the source for zip, and I believe it does its own thing for writes,
haven't looked at it closely yet.

     CDL BASIC
     From: TEDJAEGER    To: ALL

Hi All,
       Been looking at CBdemo and docs. I read in the docs that one can
do system calls form this BASIC but see no examples how. What would be
the CDL BASIC equivalent of:

 Type registers=d(8),a(8),pc:INTEGER
 DIM regs:registers
 DIM callcode:INTEGER
 callcode=$0c
 run syscall(callcode,regs)
 id=regs.d(1)

 Since there is no syscall in CDL, I'm wondering how to get a BASIC
 variable loaded with the result of the system call and how to execute
 that call as well. I do see in the docs the indication that one can
 mix assembler with CDL BASIC but there is no example of how to use
 that technique and return a value from a system call. Thanks...

 Could you give an example? I figure to get a process ID one goes:

  os9 F$ID

 There are no entry conditions so no registers to load, no? This leaves me
 with the process ID in register d1. So how do I get the ID number out of
 d1 to a BASIC variable? Does that too have to be done in assembler? A
 move command? Perhaps the printed manual would/should cover this as, in my
 experience, nothing too serious can be done in BASIC without system
 calls.

 I bet HAWKSOFT could do this one in his sleep! Chris, are you there? Its
 CDL BASIC Chris.

  First, let me say that Marking messages does work.  Now, I'll admit
to doing my reading from the Internet Sig, and I use the usenet reader..
Not the NN (Net News) reader.  NN is more powerful.. I've tried it, and
like to use the other simpler one.

  You don't say where you are doing the reading from, and which reader
you are using.  More info would be of help.

I've been doing it from within the OS9 Sig.  Just go in, choose Peronal
Favorites, have cocolist and comp.os9 there.  choose first one, then the
other.. in each, let's see..  you get a prompt , unread is default.  I
press enter, it tells you how many msgs & threads are there.. I then
type 1-<# threads> nonstop, having my capture turned on..

I had thought that I might need to "Mark", but I came right back in,
attempted to read messages again, but it told me "No unread messages"
so I would assume that marking is not necessary....

I assume you are responding to my message...  At least I'm not the only
one <G>.  I had been noticing it and thought maybe it was just a fluke,
but today, it's a bunch..  It could be some that are recirculating around
or something.  I've seen it on the other nets where I suppose the messages
come in from two different sources..

It wouldn't be so bad but I'm paying long distance and kinda hate to pay
for the time to get duplicates, but it might not be something that can be
avoided.

One other thing, when I went back in, it said that in coco, I believe, that
there had been some 160(?) messages in the past 14 days, that I'd read
approx. 66, but when I called for unread messages, it said "no unread msgs".

Actually, thinking about it, that sounds like maybe duplicates _are_ coming
in..

Oh, well, I can think of worse things than that..

I'm thinking we could be getting an echo, or if the ones using a different
reader are not getting them, then either we are doing something wrong or
our reader is goofing up..  As I said, I went back in and it told me I
didn't have any unread mail, so if I get dups again, then it would be
apparent to me that the dups are caused by something besides my technique.

Thats possible, but I'd rather blame it on a flacky ethernet card someplace
in the delphi system. What I'm told happens is that you may get a different
machine the next time on, and it doesn't kknow (yet) that you've been
there and read the stuffs. Problems of that nature for me went away after
an amiga conference blew up in delphi's face resulting a bunch of very
irate users, me among 'em. Subsequent troubleshoot found a bad card that
had rather effectively divided the system up into 2 pieces. Those who
got a connection on one side got into the conference, those on the other
side were told that no such conference existed! I was one of the un-lucky
ones in 3 tries that nite, and irate wasn't an adequate description of
my mood, that conference had been highly publicised (sp) for 2 weeks
ahead of time. So that maybe whats going on here. It can also result in
files you've received in mail, then deleted, mysteriously comeing back
to haunt us. I had lots of that, but after that bad card was repalced,
(sp) my probs with previously deleted mail re-appearing pretty much
went away.

     Drive Two Boot

RANDY---
I just tracked down what was giving me ERROR #247-Seek errors while trying
to boot from drive 2 with the first experimental disk I was using.

It seems that on that disk I had two programs which used guib to draw
boxes on another window. With the original 5.25 disk in drive 0, I was
able to use the ">" path descriptor to send only the output. Now, with
the 3.5 disk in drive 2, I must use the full "<>>>". The only other
change in my startup was changing d0 to d2 concerning my merge of stdfonts.

Those two programs have a status check for the version of guib. Maybe this
was where it was hanging?

Otherwise, I now have two 80 and one 40 track Drive two "working" boot disks!

If its ok with you, and you are pretty confident about the modpatch you
devised, I'll work up a text file briefly explaining what we did. (???)

You have a couple of options for an assembler.  You don't have OS9 Level
1?  It has an assembler in it.  Your other choice is to find the Development
Pak. It has a C-compatible compiler - well, you have 3 choices, really,
an earlier version of the Dev-Pak assembler is included with the C Compiler,
too, and you could use it.

I have a really good disassembler.  It is Dynamite+ from the same people who
published Dynacalc.  I don't know if they are still in business or not.

I believe a pd disassembler is here, too.. I believe it's name is "dasm".
I got it, but never did use it.. Dynacalc is so good that it wasn't worth the
effort to learn the syntax <G>.

     More on ZIP
     From: DBREEDING    To: ALL

Hey, everyone.

I guess everyone remembers me crying a while back about ZIP messing up
on the directory structure.  I kept getting occasional instances when
the bitmap for the file was not allocated.

The version I have is 1.0  Someone said it was buggy, but I have had pretty
good luck in unzipping (different program, of course), other files and
have had no complaints on files I've zipped.

I even grabbed a new zip (1.9) from chestnut, but _it_ seemed to do mess
up more often than 1.0.

I finally went in and began studying the code that came with zip, and I
_believe_ I have discovered the problem..

When all files are zipped, it has created a new temp file, usually with
the name _Z00*.  On exit, it first deletes the original *.zip, if present.
Next, it goes to a function called link().  It attempts to overwrite the
temp filename with that of the destination *.zip name, inc the link
count in the file descriptor.  (Otherwise, if any part fails, it comes
back and does a straight copy).  In either case, it calls unlink()
to delete the tempfile name.  I found that link() failed often, and
the moderately rare cases when link() was successful, were when the
file structure got munged.

The problem:

I believe I've found it.  In the file "osk.c", the main function that link()
uses is a multi-purpose one, and it optionally will get the sector size
from the device driver, or will read the disk.  Two defines are used
to control the program flow.   "FROM_DRIVER" and "FROM_DISK". My code
defines FROM_DISK, but...  somehow, the author, down around line 750,
when he wants to read the disk, uses the switch #ifdef "FROM_MEDIA"
instead of "FROM_DISK".  When I changed this to FROM_DISK, it appears
in my test program that link() is working much more often and that
the few times I have tried it, it is now fixed... (I was a little chicken
to try it on my HD <G> - but did)

If anyone is using zip, it might be well to fix this.  Actually, I wonder
if it would be safest to just eliminate this link() call from the procedure,
as I wouldn't mind its doing a copy, as my main use for it is in small
QWK replies and large copies to floppy for MS-DOS systems is not all that
frequent.

Is there someone who should be notified about this?  I couldn't determine
who might be in charge of the OS-9 end of it..
