     PCPower news letter typo
     From: DOMM         To: ALL

In the PCPower News - article 1396 - it was reported that:

>..."D.A.V.I.D"... was an "OS/2 derived" thing.

Well...after consulting with Mike Rowen..I was assured it must be a typo.

This misaligned information just would't do ....so....I emailed them...

Just got the reply... says...it has now been fixed to read "OS-9" <G>

(enough is enough, ya know?

I thought it was really neat.  Of course it exaggerated a little, I
suppose, but in a way, it truly captured the essence of MS.

Let's see.. I'll write a program that will reverse the letters and

But why do the big guys give us so much ammunition?  Actually, I'm surprised
that the people doing the satire haven't been contacted by Microslop's lawyers
to cease and desist.  I just about every news article about weak 95 mentions
that there will be bugs.  They aren't even falling back on the old saying that
bugs are just undocumented features.  I saw one article where a Mac user
was blasting weak 95 by saying Macs were doing what was was being hyped several
years ago.  Gee, does that sound familiar?

Well, I'd guess that if they went after these, it would be some rather
bad publicity.

In the US News story I saw, there was a sidebar by a Mac user comparing
MacOS and Win95.

They are actually right about the way Win 95 looks more like a Mac than
previously.  It's sad that the most popular system going has to upgrade
to catch up with the underdogs.

            Another OS-9er in Windoze-land.

            NO, this is NOT another "goodbye" note.  OS-9 remains alive
            and well on my desk, and the MM/1a will be my "main"
            computer until it smokes or gets hopelessly outmoded -- then
            I will get ANOTHER OS-9 machine.

            OK, I couldn't resist the hype.  I went out and bought
            Windows-95 for the messydos machine.  So far, so good.
            Installation was pretty much "idiot-proof" and took about 45
            minutes. Windows-95  looks to me like a cross between a Mac
            and OS2.  Everything works, and seems faster than before.
            Christie's cute koala videos come up real fast now.  That
            was the BIG test.  If  it couldn't show those koalas,
            Christie would have rejected Win-95 completely.  She hauled
            me all over a zoo in Chicago this spring looking for the
            little critters. (They were asleep).

            It seems pretty good at identifying hardware.  It correctly
            identified my  VGA card, CD, faxmodem and sound card and set
            them up without asking a lot of questions.  I watched it
            hunt down and interrogate the modem (you know the kind,
            generic, white box, not a clue who built it).  It left a
            text file describing the hardware hunt.

             Early in the installation process, the machine warned me
            that it had found OS2 on the hard drive (I'll swear it was
            holding its nose), and said I might not be able to use it
            after installing Windows-95.  The instructions referred me
            to the "Setup.txt" file for further instructions re OS2.
            That file contains a couple lines about making OS2 work, and
            a couple paragraphs on deleting OS2 completely.

            I never did get real fond of OS2, anyway.  It was slower
            than Windows 3.1 and tended to crash now and then.  I got it
            to boot after the Win-95 install, and it worked , but it
            didn't like the new windows programs (surprise).  I decided
            to kill off OS2 for now, I still have the two CD's it came
            on, and the dozen or so floppies full of patches that make
            the CD's work, so I can put it back on if I want to.

            OS-9000 and LINUX are still alive and well.  I have to boot
            them from floppies now, because Windows-95 found and killed
            the boot manager I was using.   It was the Mark Williams
            Boot Manager that came with COHERENT, and it had managed to
            survive and work long after I removed the COHERENT system,
            but it couldn't hide from Win-95.  Snoopy and very selfish -
            - it wants the whole computer for itself.  It didn't mess
            with the non-DOS partitions though.  I finally found that
            boot manager stashed in a backup file.  Might install it or
            LINUX LILO loader later -- floppy boots are OK for now.

            I have (so far) resisted the temptation to check out the
            Microsoft Network.  I think I am subscribing to enough
            online services for now.  (More than enough, some might
            say).  I'll have to read the instructions --  maybe there
            are some free hours I can use and then quit.

            I did fill out the online registration form and let the
            machine zap it to an "800" number somewhere.    I expect to
            get a lot of junk mail.

            This is painful to admit, fellow OS-9ers, but I think Mr.
            Gates and crew have done a pretty good job here.  We can
            point out that OS-9, UNIX, (LINUX, etc),  Macs, Amigas etc
            have been doing some of this for a long time, but now the
            OTHER 90% of the world has a pretty capable system.

            A good feature of  Win-95 is the ability to set up
            "shortcuts".  You can get into a program fairly fast, then
            shove that silly rodent to the back of the desk, grab the
            keyboard, and do something useful.  I like that.

  Wonderfull.. did you get a prompt that this was going to happen,
or did the installer just go ahead and do it ?

  I would be leery of using that.  I don't have first hand experience

Hi Dave,
  The piece I posted here WAS greatly exaggerated, but, in my opinion
so is Microsquish.  I would say that this is were you read it.
  $300,000,000 for promotional gimics, HA!  That would be equivalent
of me spending $20.00 at an arcade!  Must be nice to have that kind
of dough to throw away.  WINDOZE on a submarine?  Give me a break,
PLEASE!  Although, if you think about it, there ARE submarines with
windows.  I DO NOT see his point of experiencing being on a sub-
marine WITHOUT windows, do you?  Is there supposed to be some sig-
nificant value or point to that?  If there is, I surely fail to see
it.  But, then again, I DO NOT see "through" WINDOZE.
  I went to the Computer Expo here in San Diego last weekend.  Here
is were they (Microsquish) debued(sp) WINDOZE 95.  They had this 15
foot plexi-glass box filled with software packages.  You had to make
a correct guess as to how many boxes were in there and I guess you
would win WINDOZE 95.  My son and I bypassed their booth and went
straight over to the OS/2 booth.  They were giving away copies of
OS/2 in their drawings.  I did not enter any.  Of course, I DID
spend most of my time at the OS-9 booth.  One thing puzzles me
though,  I fail to understand why it is catagorized as "New Tech-
nology"  Oh well, at least it was there, again.  I must say that
the UG did set up one impressive display booth.  There were many
people stopping by and asking questions.  Too bad they did not get
the MM/1 in time to display it as well.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

LONG LIVE OS-9! <FOREVER> ** In whatever form it is in!

This sounds like a really honest opinion..  I'm sure it's true.  It's
a shame, though, that this outfit was able to appropriate all the
good stuff that the rest developed and claim it as their own.

I guess it's a fact that this is the shape of things to come.  I'd
say they have won the war.  No due to superiority, but the fact that
the world of computer users is a bunch of sheep.

That is strange.  Maybe if they call it new technology, they think
people will suppose OS-9 copied all the neat stuff in Win 95 from _them_?
And then they can say, if that is not enough, look at all the neat
features the Mac ripped off them (about 15 years ago).

Perhaps it will draw a new user or two.  Events like that is where I would
like to see some really neat new apps displayed.

15 years ago, the Mac didn't exist.
15 years ago the IBM PC didn't exist.

Well, I _did_ say "about".. <G>  Wanted to make it sound as good as possible.

No warning during the install, but I did find a few words about beating
up on boot managers in the text files, and it left the old one in a
backup file.  I installed the Linux "LILO" loader today, and it works
with all three opsystems (WIN/OS9K/Linux).  OS-9000 still refuses to
boot unless it's partition is the "active" one, but the other two
don't seem to care, so that's OK.

Aw c'mon, that would be a new level of sleaze, and maybe the makings
of a lawsuit that would be a lot of fun.  I assume the "online registration"
reported on installed hardware, and maybe even software.  Hmmm, that
would be an interesting "anti-piracy" tactic, wouldn't it?  (Picturing
a version of Wordperfect or AutoCad that looks for a live modem and
"phones home" ... interesting thought.)

Well, IMO, it was IBM that made Bill Gates.  I have heard people, when
contemplating buying a system, without hesitation, indicated that
they would go straight to IBM.  From this, the more cost-conscious
buyers wanted IBM, or figured that if IBM did it, it had to be good,
flocked to the clones.  After the ball got rolling, more and more people
followed like sheep, and eventually, it got to where this market was
where all the software authors could make any money.  The Mac has a
pretty fair market, but the _big_ slice of pie is in the MS-Dos world.

 > I am so

Yeah.  The only mis-information regarding OS-9 is that the "media" tends
to try to ignore it.  I have watched reports on the Video-on-Demand
project.  They talk like it's MS-Dos that is operating the system.  I
have seen them even come out and say as much, or else make no mention of
what system is driving it and just leave the impression that it is MS-Dos.
It may be that the development out on the west coast might be trying to
plod along with them, but the Atlantic Bell system is using a MicroWare
product.  A little modified from our system, but the same thing.

 I don't think so.  I can't find the source on this right now (my
 wife pesterd me so much I cleaned up the den) but I read that PacTel
 (the CA/NV RBOC) is considering the same system as Bell Atlantic and
 Nynex are implementing.  There isn't really much choice unless they
 want to start from scratch.  Once the decision was made to go with
 OS9 in the East, the set top manufacturers started building boxes.
 There is already a substantial financial commitment in this market
 to OS9; changing now would mean losing money -- ever hear of the
 phone company losing money if they could avoid it?

 Also, Motorola has invested in ITV and VOD and has bought an
 interest in Microware (8%?).  I don;t know how far the partnership
 goes but if it's tight, this will give Microware an inside track
 onto Iridium

 A caveat here.  I've heard thru the grapevine that the specs on the
 settop API's are being written to be opsys independent.  I have a
 hunch the RBOCs looked at what happen to the business computer
 market and don't want to be trapped the way most businesses are.
 It's true that OS9's modular design provides an upgrade path that
 other operating systems can't compete with yet but, remember, OS9
 came out of left field for most of the people who are implementing
 the VOD and ITV networks so they don't know what they're dealing
 with yet and are probably a little scared of it.

 Unless Microware drops the ball and walks off the field, Microsoft
 doesn't have much of a chance in the ITV market unless they want to
 build the infrastructure themselves (or buy out the phone company
 :-).  Microsoft has a _TERRIBLE_ reputation for bad behavior in
 partnerships.  To exploit a market as big as the whole embedded
 scene (including ITV and VOD) looks like it will become will take
 cooperation between suppliers.  Cooperation is essential and
 Microsoft doesn't cooperate well.

 There's also the not-so-small matter of all the hype associated
 with Win95.  If you work with marketing types for a while you start
 to understand what indicates whether a company is doing well or
 not.  One indicator is called the "Law" of hype -- things are not
 alway the way they appear in the press.  When a company is doing
 well, it doesn't need the hype.  When it does need the hype it
 usually means it's in trouble.

 The only real weakness I can see is that the current plans are
 downstream biased.  This bias isn't built into DAVID but the
 consumer won't know that and may associate it with the product.
 It's more likely tho the provider will get the "blame."

Actually, Gates did "create" MS-DOS as it is known today. Yes, he bought a
system that was working and used that as a base to work from, but he did
re-work the code and write a lot of extras to go along with it. Try writing
some device drivers or modifying a lot of the OS-9 code yourself. Then
you'll appreciate the effort that has gone into improving MS-DOS over the
years. Now I still think it is a bloated system, but given what it has to
run on, it can't be helped.... ;>

It could very well be that or they may just want to stay on the good
side of MS, but it can be quite aggravating to hear people who are
supposedly "in the know" be so far off base.  It was in the post here
that was quoted from the Wall Street Journal, I believe, where it was
stated that MS was trying to get the contract, but their system could
just not measure up.

What you said in the following sounds quite valid and reasonable.  Unless
there was some kind of "bed-fellowship", I cannot see why they would choose
MS on the West coast, since it didn't measure up on the east.

Gates didn't buy CPM86. Nor did he rename it.

CPM86 wasn't ready, (or Kildall didn't want to talk to IBM)
so IBM started shopping around for another
OS vendor. Microsoft happened to be available.

MS then bought the rights to a totally different OS, from a totally
different company. DR had nothing to do with it.

Well, yes, but...the companies that have announced that they will use
DAVID inclusive-or be compatible with DAVID have considerably more name
recognition than Microware, and I'd say that some of them have as much
name recognition as Microsoft.

Hi Dave,
  I do agree with you when you say that "IBM made Bill Gates."  Then
again, I think, if it were not for IBM and Intel, the PC would not be
what it is today.  I have to wonder though, when IBM was looking for
a DOS for their NEW machine, was OS-9 or UNIX for that matter even
considered?  Would Bill Gates be on "the throne" if IBM would have
gone with CP/M?  I do have to admit, somewhat reluctantly, that I do
admire Gates for what he has acheived, although I do not agree with
some of his tactics, my hat IS off to him.
  Ya know, I really did like the song "Start Me Up" by the Stones,
but now when I am listening to the radio and here it, I think I am
listening to a WINDOZE 95 commercial.  I guess Gates likes the Stones
music too!

Hi Frank,
  Sorry, but I have to agree and dis-agree.  Sure, Gates did improve
upon MS-DOS, but it is still NOT up to speed with OS-9.  I look at
DOS from the point of veiw of this SIG.  OS-9 has come a long way
since it was first released by Radio Shack.  Look at all the patches
and major module re-writes of OS-9.  Most have been done by the "BIG
GUN" gurus in the know.  I myself have even contributed, albeit in a
very small way, when I made a patch to INIT so cc3go does not remain
in memory.  That is not to say that "we" created OS-9, "we" have just
created its improvements.  IMHO Gates, or the people in his employ,
have created the improvements, for what they are worth, upon DOS.
INIT was created by the people at Microware, I just created an im-
provement to it.

 I remember a bit about that (modular Windows - right?).  As I recall
 it has a major downstream bias which may sound good to the execs in
 charge but, based on the popularity for the Internet, I think the
 consumer is going to demand full upstream capability too.  The age
 of the closed system where the broadcaster provides to you what they
 think you want is dying fast.  Now, businesses and induividuals want
 to be able to connect to the networks as providers as well as a
 consumers of information.  DAVID provides for full speed connections
 *both* ways (no bias) even tho the current implementations aren't
 taking advantage of it.

 The Microsoft name may be important to some executive types and
 Gates may take advantage of this and extend the Microsoft name to
 his VOD products.  Doing so he runs the risk of "line extension" and
 having all associated products judged by the performance of his
 _worst_ products.

 Ever wonder why the big auto manufacturers have different names for
 the same car?  Remember the adverse effect the Pinto had on Ford
 sales?  Didn't hurt Mercury tho.  How about the Corvair and Vega for
 Chevrolet?  Pontiacs still sold just as well.  Microware is playing
 a much smarter marketing game by keeping the OS9 name separate from
 CD-I separate from DAVID.  Even if DAVID flops, the failure won't be
 name associated with Microware's other products.

 DAVID also the advantage of being first in the market.  If it
 succeeds, this establishes it in a position of leadership and
 everyone else will have to play catch up.

It would probably be different, whether better or not is the $64 question.
Apple would undoubtedly have gotten a much bigger share of the market.
Whether they would have been pushed to develop as far and as fast as
they have is uncertain to me.  It could be that, had they have had the
larger market, they could have developed faster, but the cost of the
machines might have remained high.  But, it could well be that third-party
manufacturers would have offered alternatives and have pushed the price
down as well.  IMO, the only good thing coming from the IBM/MS "takeover"
was that we now have very affordable machines.  But it's a sure-fire
thing that this was not done according to IBM's wishes.  <G>

I really don't know.  I have a feeling that Microware and probably the
owners of UNIX (Bell Labs??) probably asked IBM more than they wanted
to pay for license fees and thought they could get by cheap with MS-Dos.
Actually, I wonder if IBM even expected the PC marked to even last.

 > Would Bill Gates be on "the throne" if IBM would have
 > gone with CP/M?

I seriously doubt it but it's something we will now never know.  Of course
Radio Shack chose MS-Basic for their systems.  Had IBM not have come in,
it's possible that R-S would have had more influence in the market.

Well, I'm sure he is a man of vision, but the fact that he was at the right
place at the right time did not hurt.  Whether the fact that he _was_ at
that spot was entirely his own doing or just a matter of luck is another
matter.  I'm sure he was to some extent the master of his own fate.

Kildall himself has acknowledged that when IBM came
calling he was not available. Popular myth is that he
was not available because he was joyriding in his private plane.
Kildall disputes with popular myth, and I'm very much inclined
to believe his version. The facts remain: CPM86 was not available
to IBM on IBM's schedule, nor was Kildall himself available to IBM
on IBM's schedule. Kildall does not dispute this.
So how is any of this Gates' fault?

And what does any of this have to do with OS-9? <g>

I know the story. Fact remains that Gates DID buy a legit license to CPM86
though. Now how much of the code he copied rather than wrote from scratch is
somethng for the legal types to determine, and I guess that never happened.

When comparing MS-DOS to OS-9, I agree that OS-9 would have been the better
choice, and IBM may have considered it  at one point.. or most likely would
have. You see, they looked at Motorola processors before choosing Intel.
They considered everything on the current market. The 68xxx chips weren't
all ready at the time, and since the 6809 wasn't going to be fully downward
compatible with the 68K series, they chose Intel instead. Got this from a
person who worked for IBM at the time!

Gates didn't buy a license from Digital itself... he bought out a company

Well, I've done some inet mail, and a little ftp, and that's about it.  I
read the cocolist and comp.os.os9. Right now, I just cannot invest in the
long distance charges to do a lot of newsgroups.  Hopefully I will have
local access soon.  We have one BBS that does a daily exchange, but I
think at this time, what use I make of the internet can be more efficiently
done here or on CIS.

IMO, one could probably get one where it could kinda connect fairly quickly.
The big problem is in all the little obscure facets.

I took a quick look at the posiblity of writing a RIP terminal program.  In
looking at the commands, I found that most of the basic commands are already
implemented in G-Windows, that is, circle, arc, etc...  I'm sure there are
the same in K-W and the CoCo also has these primitives, so this would
probably be just a matter of incorporating them into the program.  With
RIP, I think the bigget job might be in interpreting the graphics files
you download.

I have no info on WWW, so don't really know how big a job it would be.

 Someone has suggested this before, but what would be really nice is a
kind of "graphcap" system.  Some kind of universal graphics module that
sits in memory (like cio?), accepts some standard graphics commands and
displays them on the Kwindows, Gwindows, Xwindows, MGR or whatever
Wonderful New Windowing System comes out next week.  It would be slow,
and eat up some memory, but it should be at least POSSIBLE.  I fear
this project would require a programmer with a lot more time (and skill)
than me. (But I'm thinking about it, anyway).

  In case you didn't know, buffer capture it.  When your at the point
where Delphi's reader tells you how many messages are `unread' and how
many `you have read' just open your buffer and type ` unread nonstop '
and away you go.  Do this for each group you want to read off line.

  I feel that you would wind up reverse engineering it. Companies like
netscape won't tell you what the `codes' are that are used.

This is what I do.  I capture it all and then run it through ved, deleting
most and cutting-and-saving some messages that I want to keep.

It would be harder to do like that.  I have not explored the aspects of it,
and, as you said, it would probably be a little hard to get right.

The problem with such projects as this is that you can probably get something
that will "kind of" run, but it takes forever to get all the little fine
points worked out right.

This is exactly what I had thought we need.  It would work something like
gfx2.  You would send it a command with the applicable parameters and then
this module could do the dirty work.

 > It would be slow,
 > and eat up some memory, but it should be at least POSSIBLE.

Yes, it would incur a speed hit.. how much would be hard to say...  It
would depend on how frequently the calls would be made.  It might be
that something like this would be too slow for comm work using a high
speed modem, but might be worth a try.

 > I fear
 > this project would require a programmer with a lot more time (and skill)
 > than me. (But I'm thinking about it, anyway).

Not really.  The big job at hand would be to get a common calling protocol.
Then a programmer for each platform could write the individual code.
A project like this would require some careful thought and would need
to get the protocol standardized before starting.  This might be a
project to be carried on throught the OS9 UG.   It would simplify
programming for the graphical windows.  The other possibility would
be to write the program and all graphical work could be carried out
within one file containing the functions to do that.  Then if I, say
wrote a program for G-Windows, I could pass the code on to an MM/1
programmer and all he should have to do would be to edit this one
file.

Whatever we do, though, we do need some way to get the good graphics
programs to run on all systems.  It is a little sad right now to
see some really great piece of work for K-Windows, for example, but
G-Windows users not being able to use it, and vice versa..

Yes, I figured that your post was more of this nature.  It's easy to
fail to get it changed right.  I replied to it anyway <G>..

As you say, I expect everyone will be able to see it anyway.

P.S.   This thread must be jinxed.  I just posted a reply and it got

of the resource demo, it can't save, but it doesn't terribly impress me at all.
Matt Dillon used to have one that came with D.I.C.E., but since about 2.26, its
not been on the distribution disks. ADis si also a candidate, but its not too
bulletproof either, takes it half a page of binary to get in time again if the
starter address given is not at an instruction boundary. Or at least the copies
I have do. They are a bit old, not much has been done in the last 2-3 years on
them. Sad.

What I did was copy the source listed in OS9 Insights.  The driver for
my System 5 was modelled after it.  I edited it by hand till I got it
to assemble the identically same module.  I then went to work making
my changes.  As of now, it seems to work quite well.  I added an
automatic Hardware Flow control routine to replace XOn/XOff, or in
addition to it.  Mine is rather crude, but it appears to be doing
the job.

That's with your driver?

What system do you have?  Do you use STerm?  One thing STerm does is
send XOFF when it does a disk write.  However, with the latest modems,
you probably have a buffer within the modem that has data in it.  Now,
IMO, unless you have your modem set for Software Handshake (not advisable
for binary transfers), it will ignore this and keep sending, and your
buffer will overflow.  Actually, this is probably the problem you are
experiencing.  Your driver is not getting the modem halted and the
modem keeps pumping data to the driver even after the buffer is filled
up.  If you are experiencing overflowing buffers, you will see your
data repeated.

Delmar sells a serial card for their computers.  I'm not sure if it's 16550
or not.  One of the shortcomings of the 68681 driver that came with my
system was that it had an unbearably small buffer, 200 bytes, I believe.
That, coupled with no automatic Hardware Flow control made it very unreliable
with hi-speed transfers, zmodem was unusable with windows.  Now, in a text
screen, it worked fine.  The graphics screen is slow enough that it made it
hard for it to keep up in windows.  Actually, when I increased the buffer to
2k, it seemed to work OK, even without HW flow control.  It probably would
have barfed if it were scrolling an extremely long text file.

However, I think the reason Delmar had not worked on the 68681 drivers
was due to the fact that they _did_ have a serial card and I believe
most people were using it.  However, as of now, I can get by with
my current ports.  Might try a 28.8 modem and see if I'm still happy
with it <G>

Sorry bout the confusion here, but all that was refering to my other computer,
a stuffed Amiga 2000. 9 megs ram, 345 IDE drive, multiface III, cdrom etc.
And those are SLOW figures, we just picked up a fresh scsi card for one at
the tv station that checked in at 3.2 megs/sec to the best drive of the 4
hard drives in that box. We oughta get the STerm fellows in touch with Olaf
Barthel of Amiga "Term" fame. However, the way that the amiga does it, with
most of that sort of thing delegated to a loadable library, which any one
of the 10 or so term proggys for the amiga may call, we can't blame the
term proggy, but the library doing the dirty work at the instant. Rather
similar to the zmodem situation here in that its an external procedure, but
this stuff carries over to even text captures! So the only safe place to
capture this forum in the "read new ns ft" mode is to open the file in the
ramdisk where it can write very quickly, litterally in between bytes rx'd!

Ed, the only advantage the AT-306 has over the System IV is price. For the
$400, you also get "Personal OS-9", which is (admittedly) a cobbled together
system (Industrial OSK with a couple additions licensed from MW, some
special utilities and drivers written by Karl, and some PD utils), but has
all the major components. Since it is a licensed product (at least most of
it!), there are no compatibility problems. A version of BASIC also comes
with it. A PT68K4 board runs about the same price, but add another $300 for
OSK. The only thing missing in the "Personal" package is the C compiler,
which for a deveolper/progammer might be a problem, but not the average
user. And the GCC version is available.

However, I believe that the GCC compiler still relies upon the Microware
assembler.  Until the GNU assembler is ported to support OSK...

I wonder if any of the vendors will be licensing Ultra-C from Microware?
(For example, PT customers (only) can buy Ultra-C from them at a much
more reasonable price -- in fact, it would have been cheaper for me to
buy a PT board and then get Ultra-C, than to just buy U-C for my MM/1,
since IMS didn't license it, and PT couldn't give MM/1 owners the
special rate.)

Yes, from what I have seen, the AT-306 is a great system.  It may be the
key for many to gain entry into the OSK field.  I would say that you
can build the AT-306 up to full specs for any of the systems.  However,
I cannot shake the feeling that the PT/Delmar systems have been given the
reputation for being much more expensive.  I believe that you can strip
them down to where you can have them for little more than any of the others.
They may cost a little more, but I don't think it is that much more when
you make them totally equivalent.

From my experience, I think you should have 4 Meg of memory (3 is OK on
the MM/1) to do serious work.  If you want, you can get by on a Terminal
System, but to really fly, you need your own video to do the windows stuff.

Yes, that is true.  Many do prefer this version, so it will probably be
not a big handicap.  Personally, I like my 3.2 MW compiler.  The only
thing about using GCC, as we discussed here, is the fact that you need
to be open with your source.

As I said, any system is great.  They all are quite capable, but I would
suggest that any potential purchaser carefully analyze what he wishes to
do with his system, how far he expects to go with it, and how much
expansion is available for the system in question and at what cost.

 I responded to Boisy's message in the vein of a machine for programmers.
 From Msg 93308, I quote -

 "The AT306 represents a chance for us, the personal OS-9 programmers, to
 start over and do things right.  ..."

 As such, the AT-306 will not include a C Compiler, assembler and linker.
 (To the best of my knowledge, GCC does not include an assembler or linker
 for OS9.)  Further, the SYSTEM IV includes the full MW documentation.
 Purchased separately, this costs $200.00.  Considering the SYSTEM IV is
 available for as low as $999 assembled, tested and ready to run, I doubt
 the AT-306 will price out any lower if the C-Compiler and documentation
 are included.  Further, the SYSTEM IV is fully supported.  While the AT-306
 board may be supported, the buyer is on his own when adding accessories such
 as hard drive, floppies, PS, video card, etc.  An example of the support is
 the availability of Ultra-C to buyers of the SYSTEM IV for only $300.00.
 The regular price is $1295.

 I'm not knocking the AT-306 - simply trying to put everything in perspective.

David, I priced these out in a previous issue. The system itself IS priced
about like the AT306 if you get the boards and build it yourself. The
problem here is that OS-9/68K costs an additioanl $300. So you spend about
$300-$400 more on a PT68K (System IV). If you want a basic OSK system, not
G-windows or any real graphics capabilities, then you can get a PT68K2 board
for significantly less.

Ed, I guess you are correct. What some of the MM/1 users are doing is buying
the older version of OSK along with the new machine and using the C compiler
from there. As a programmers/developers machine, the System V is probably
the best buy with software and performance. The AT306 is probably a better
"users machine", providing the best bang for the buck to start off with. My
understanding is that you will be selling some of the AT-306 boards also?
They would be good as smart terminals/workstations paired with a System V
server, I would think!

Yes, now that you mention it, I remember that article.  I probably need to
go back and review it.  I'm sure that the P-T type systems may be a little
higher, but, again, we need to remember that we want to compare the
systems when they are equal.  FWIW, and it may be a minor concern for
many, but the AT306 comes with personal OS9. If you are not going to
do any programming, then this would probably be the most logical way
to go.  However, should you decide you will want to do some C programming,
then you will have to then buy the compiler.  I think it was mentioned
that GNU C is available, but you still don't get the assembler/linker.
However, as a side note, did I read somewhere that you could upgrade
the OS to 2.4 Professional for around $50?

There is no doubt that the AT306 _is_ as good buy, especially if you have
access to cheap components, like used drives, already have a case or can
find one cheaply.  However, the point I wanted to make is that when many
think about the Delmar/PT systems, they immediately think something like
"twice as much", and I think this reputation is undeserved.

When I was making my mind up to purchase, I did a lot of comparative
shopping. I compared the System 4/5 to the MM/1.  Of course I got my
system configured pretty well decked-out, I could have gotten it for
less,  but I got a System 5, 25-MHz CPU, 4 Meg memory, 210 meg HD,
G-Windows plus the Development System.  With this system, I got
a parallel port already hooked up and 4 serial ports.

Now, in comparison with the MM/1, I could have gotten a system really
cheap, what is the startup price, $600 m/l? for a system in a case?

However, to make it viable, you need a HD and you really need the I/O
board as a minimum.  And to really get serious, you need to get the
9(?) Meg upgrade, of course you can get by with the 3 meg standard for
quite some time.  I have not really had any problems with my 4 meg as of
yet.

However, the AT306 bypasses some of these problems.  You have most of the
stuff available.  You have a pretty sizeable memory upgrade potential,
don't you?  A parallel port is already onboard, it accepts SVGA (I think
this is becoming increasingly important).  Actually, I agree that it _is_
a really neat system, I may get one to play around with myself, but I
still think one contemplating buyng a system should look at all the
aspects and be sure of his choice.  Each system has its strong points
and each has a little drawback that another of the systems does not
have.  I feel that one system might be better for one person whereas
for someone else, another system would be better suited.

You are correct David, one should look at all available systems. As to
choosing the System IV over an MM/1, I think that was a VERY good choice!
The System IV is a lot more flexible in configuration. The new MM/1b (AT306
board) is comparable to the System IV (PT68K4 board) in most, if not all,
respects. I actually think the I/O on the AT306 is a bit better, with all
the ports on the motherboard. But in any case, the buyer has to compare and
make a reasonable choice for themselves.

It depends.  It is a good idea to give some idea as to what you are replying
to.  Often I get a reply to a message and it is quite unclear as to what
I said, and I cannot remember what the subject was even about.  With "ix",
you go in and read "NEW" messages.  In this mode, you cannot jump to
old messages that have already been read.  If you need to refresh your
memory, you have to quit this mode, go into "read all" mode, find that
message and then come back.  I'm sure we do go overboard on quoting but
sometimes a little too much is better than not enough.

Well.. I wouldn't say the MM/1 would have been a bad choice.  I don't think
I would have been unhappy with an MM/1.

 > The System IV is a lot more flexible in configuration.

Yes, this is one advantage.  I think the biggest limit to the Sys 4 is
that it is limited to a maximum of 4 Meg memory, if I am not mistaken.
I think this is adequate for many purposes.  I have 4 meg right now and
have not been pressed yet.

I may be wrong on this, but I would think the AT306 might have a little
more expansion capability than a Sys 4 if you want to push it to its
limit.  At least in memory.  I'm not sure about what is on the motherboard
of a Sys 4.  I thought the serial ports were and perhaps the printer port.
I don't know how the CPU's would compare, whether there would be any
functional difference or not.

I have a Sys 5 myself.  All the ports you would need to get started are
on the M/B.  There are 4 serial ports, the floppy controller, an IDE
controller, and your parallel ports are all on the M/B.  If you can
stand the pressure, you can stick 128 Meg of memory on the board.  This
would be just a little rich for my blood <G>.

I think what makes the Delmar/PT systems and the AT-306 so attractive is
the capability of using standard PC cards.  The big rub of this is that
you just can't run down to Wal-Mart, pick up just any old video card,
for example, take it home, plug it in and expect it to work.  You still
have to stick with what they have written drivers for or be able to write
your own, but I think as time goes on and if the market expancs, the
choices will expand also.

Yes, this is the bottom line.  I believe I saw a message from Ken Scales,
(I think it was he), and he said that he had recommended OSK systems to
three different people just in that week and for the purpose each wanted,
he recommended a different one of the three available at that time to
each of the people.  It all depends on what you want to do and how a
particular system would meet those needs.

     MM/1 parallel ports bidirectional?
     From: JEJONES      To: ALL

I bit the bullet and bought a printer that ought to last me a LONG time...
but it turns out that to take full advantage of it, I need to be able to
send it commands *and* listen to its responses.  So, the question I have
is: can I do that on my MM/1a's /p?  (I tried "com /p" but got back an
error 203, "bad I/O mode," so I'm not very hopeful.)  If I can't, are
there serial/parallel converters that will let me connect the way I
want?  Thanks.

     OS-9 Late Night
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL

         This is just a note to say thanks to all who attended last
       nights Open Forum. It was another good conference, and like most
       OF's we just talked about everything :-)

         Now NEXT WEEK will be our big 1st anniversary conference. This
       should prove to be very festive. With 'the world of 68 micros'
       turning two with this issue(keep it up Frank!), and with OS-9 Late
       Night proving itself a success, there is a lot to celebrate, so
       don't miss next weeks conference!

         On Sept 4th Mike Rowen, the OS-9 Users' Group VP of 6809 will be
       returning to talk more with us about UG activity, and to hear your
       suggestions, and perhaps any plans you may have to participate!

         September 18th is going to be the Atlanta Fest Conference.
       Newton White from the Atlanta Computer Society, the group that
       sponsors the fest, will be on hand to cover anything related to
       the Atlanta fest. If you are one of the many last minute attendees
       who might need more details, don't miss 'See You in Atlanta' on
       the 18th.

         And finally, on September 25th, Kurt Johnson, President of the
       'KD Consulting Group', will be here to tell us more about
       Sculptor, the OS-9 database system of choice. Sculptor is in use
       in a wide variety of applications and by many companies and
       institutions. Come find out more about this versatile software.
       Also, as I said above, the company is called 'KD Consulting
       Group', and not 'KD Associates' which I had accidently posted
       previously. I don't know why I decided to screw that up, but it
       should be all set now. Luckily Mr. McKay keeps his eyes open when
       I don't :-)

         I'm afraid my knowledge in C is even less then what I know with

       far from able to do it :-(

         >>Does MGR have similar buttons?<<

         I don't know, as I haven't seen it yet, tho it seems to be the
       direction that OSK systems could be headed in if the AT-306 goes
       over. That is unless G-Windows get's ported like Ed is planning to
       do, and people switch to Gwindows. MGR is shipped with the AT-306
       based machines, so like the MM/1 before it, I imagine a lot to be
       developed for this if the machines sell. Kwindows sounds like it
       is on the decline, as far as support is concerned, but don't quote
       me. Ask Boisy about the buttons, he might know.

         >>I'm sorry, but what is an AT-306. Am I really that out of
       touch? :)<<

         AT-306 is the new board designed by Kreider Electronics and is
       what is in the current MM/1B(heard of that one yet?) and
       Whittman's WCP-306. I thought of it originally as another update
       to the MM/1, but after learning more about it, it is a completely
       new design. Hardware, as Ed Gresic said,is similar to the System
       IV in that it's less Coco geared and aimed more at more powerfull
       hardware and software capabilities, such as being able to use PC
       type cards with the proper descriptors, and has the ability to
       run, as Boisy put it, more mature GUI's, such as MGR and Gwindows.
       I can't comment personally as I haven't seen any  of them in
       action, but the description tells me this is an improvement. This
       is probably the way the MM/1 should have originally been done. The
       next few months will be interesting for the new machine!

     Rick is correct if you want interactive viewing, but if you simply
want to be able to download the graphics for later viewing, and can
live with a text only interface, there is an MS-DOS based version of
lynx called DosLynx which should work.  Is anyone working on an OS-9

     Yes! Defenately! The User's Group will have to find a new nesting
place, or buy 286es. :/

     If they flush the Mac Users too, I will quit Delphi. There will be no
way for me to Log on! I'm tempted to get rid of my Telenut Account since
I don't do much serious D/Ling anymore. Then I'll just have this one on
10/4. I didn't like my last bill on AOL, $75! It's because browsing in
AOL is like walking through a freaking musieum. Before you know it, youv'e
been there all day. Right now, on Delphi, I just type GO COM OS9
WHO DATA NEW <ENTER,ENTER,CTRL-Z,CTRL-Z,BYE> and I'm gone. But with the
GUI you'll have to wait for new icons, scroll, click <MORE>, wait, scroll,
click <MORE>...

     It also means people will have to junk their newly updated D-Lite
(and we will lose IX <there's allways Compuserve though>)

     They will loose the ST, Amiga, and other SIGs that don't have DOS
users, and that must be around 600 users that will have to quit.

     I'm forwarding this message to Service, and anyone who can come up
with a good petition for all the affected sigs could post them there and
say forward to service. That will make it easy, and we can show them how
many members they will lose. I doubt they will go GUI only (DOS only)
but if it looks like that's what will happen...

     I don't see much trouble in making Delphi auto-senseing like a RIPterm
deal.

  Well, the latest I have read in the Service Sig is something like,
`Delphi will keep the CLI as long as people use it' :)

  This is after a large number of people complained about Delphi
dropping the CLI at the end of this year.  So it seems that Delphi
does listen to it's users.  Oh, BTW.. the bigest group of complaints
came from `dos' users that don't use windows <g>.

> I don't see much trouble in making Delphi auto-senseing like a RIPterm

  I have a feeling that Delphi will setup another set of phone's to call
into Delphi just for the GUI side.  Might be 14,400 to start with 28,800
fast behind it... but, who knows <g>.  I'm just sitting back and reading
the Service Sig side <g>.

Actually, I think the intent was to keep the Text based Delphi around, and
that that fact just wasn't made clear... the New Delphi is exactly that, a New
and SEPERATE servace from the existing Delphi. As long as a demand exists for
the existing service it will continue... I think there will always be a demand
for the current text based service so I don't think there is too much to worry
about, at least not in the forseeable future...

I have no problem with the CLI...  I don't use it as effectively
as many, but it is very straightforward.

Speaking of RIPTerm, is this available for the Mac?  Our local BBS's
support RIPTerm.  I have not seen a Mac version, but would like to
know if it is.

  This is what I'm finding out from all the traffic in Service and the

  Yea, the `use it or loose it' thinking here.. but that's ok, I'll
stay and use it as long as Delphi keeps it. :)

  I'll agree with you here.  WWW browsing is one thing. Doing FTP, Gopher,
Telneting, etc. is (IMO) faster with text, and I think it will always will
be.  Plus, for me, I don't like the idea of `icons & stuff' being stored
on _my_ system just to speed things up like some `other' services do. :)

  I have this feeling that Delphi just might do the GUI this way.  It will
be interesting to watch the out come.

I have a file describing the RipTerm calls and the like..  I had thought
about doing this, but I'm not sure how much interest there would be.  Also,
it would have to be platform specific.

As a matter of fact, I did call their BBS some time ago.  (L/D is not
much of a hassle for me, it's l/d for me to access Delphi or CIS anyway <G> )

I may give it a shot sometime, just takes getting up the courage to start,
I guess...

  Actually, I don't know how wide-spread it is.  What got my attention
is that we have 2 local BBS's and both have it implemented.  I've seen it
once and it is kinda nice.  I am not all that much into the graphical
interfaces, but it would be nice to have something like this to show off  :-)
I hate it when I tell people how great my system is and when the talk comes
to some of these capabilities, about all I can do is say, "Well, we don't
have _that_ yet, but..."

I feel we have about the best OS in the world, but just don't have
the fancy interfaces to show off.

Making a complete program would take a little doing, I would think.  What
did you do, do a capture of a RIP session and then view it from that file?

I had thought about the possibility of writing a pipe to let a standard
comm program do the exchange of data, but pipe it into the RIP program
for screen display.

I think my boards use a RIP query and expect a response.

I wonder how much interest there would be for RIP capability?

To be truthful, I have not gotten started with the G-Windows programming
very much yet.  I have been putting it off, and actually shirking on my
programming.  It shouldn't be much of a problem with dealing with the
I/O that much..  The biggest problem would be in writing the file transfer
stuff unless one could get permission to incorporate someone else's stuff.
One other thought would be to call up external file transfer programs.

If and when I do get up the courage to start the project, I would be glad
to collaborate on it.  As I said, it would be neat to have something like
this that everyone could use.

Boisy,

 Interesting message on the 306 board (yeah, I'm a week behind again). I'm
a bit puzzled by the benchmarks, though. The dhrystones look strange. I seem
to remember the original MM/1 clocking in at around 1000, not 3000+. Does
the MM/1 get faster with age, did the dhrystone "standard" change, or ???
Also, why did you pick such a *slow* clock speed for the MM/1a? Why 13.89
when the '340 is shipped set to 16.67 and a lot of people have pushed that
up to the 18-20 mhz range?

 On the hard drive speed, I'm surprised you're surprised at the results, since
you've owned both a 070 and a 340. For those that don't have the machines,
When the
340 board was built and drivers written, the DMA was seriously hobbled,
supposedly in the interests of smoother multitasking; less than half as
fast as the old 070.

To Randy (and Ed) who seemed puzzled by the dhrystone values:

The program I ran was dhry2.1, grabbed off a machine at work.  My purpose
was not to promote the actual numbers, but instead the relative distance
between the numbers.

Why do I run my MM/1a at 13.89?  RAM problems ensue if I go higher.  I
start getting bus errors at random if I go higher.

I've only owned a 340, not an 070, so I am not aware of the speed of
the 68070 when it comes to disk speed.  You imply it was faster.  How
much faster?  I certainly don't know.

Boisy,

 Sorry, I thought you had upgraded to a 340, but it appears you started with
one. My disk speed comparision is based on Mark G.'s DDTEST program, which
should be here in the DB. On my MM/1a it returns 0.85 meg/sec read and 0.54
meg/sec for write. To verify the old 070 times, I just went back through
forum messages (see 58416, I think) and found that I was remembering wrong.
I thought we were getting 1.8 meg/sec on read, but I had posted 1.46. Writes
were a pedestrian 0.37.
 So, writing to the hard drive improved about like you would expect from the
340 upgrade, yet read speed was almost half as fast. Seat of the pants bears
this out. I was told that it was done to improve multitasking. I really
would like to have my blinding hard drive reads back, but have been unable
to find the proper knob to twist.

Well, I look at the dhrystones with suspicion.  The results change with the
number of passes you tell it to use.  I would assume (and we all know what that
means) that there shouldn't be too great a difference between, let's say,
20000 passes and 50000 passes.......but that is not what I get.  If that is the
way it does work, couldn't someone pick the number of passes that would make
one machine "look" a bit better than another?  I've also wondered if the way
the MM/1 does the video (colored memory) versus a video card makes a difference
 (shades of the "double speed poke" on the CoCo).  Oh,
back to the passes.....I wonder if each machine gets the same percentage change
between different number of passes.  IF I keep this up, I think I'm gonna be
on a certain "dream team" constantly challanging the tests (grin).

Boisy, as I recall it (and simplifying somewhat due to the hour)...

The difference is in how the CPU treats DMA.  With the 68070, a DMA
operation, once initiated, took over the buss until it was complete.
With the 68340, the amount of time allocated for DMA can be programmed
to be less than 100% of the buss cycles.

Under the 68070 environment, a DMA sequence effectively locks out other
operations, analogous to masking interrupts on the CC3.  One manifestation
of this arrangement is the tendency for "buffer over-runs" of the mouse
data during DMA operations.  (This can cause mouse "lock-ups" when
the mouse drivers do not provide appropriate error handling.)  However,
DMA operations are _very_ fast, evidenced by fast hard drive "read"
performance.

With the 68340 DMA programmed for less than 100% occupancy, hard drive
"read" throughput is reduced, but the probability of mouse "buffer over-runs"
occurring is drastically reduced.

Hope this helps.  I hope others will chip in with more details to explain
(or contradict if appropriate) the above.

Cheers... / Ken

There are at least a couple of Dhrystone programs out and about--well, three
if you count the original, which was written in Ada.  The first Dhrystone
program tried to approximate the alleged frequency of (non-floating point)
operations, but was written such that smart compilers could notice operations
that were never used and could be deleted, thus defeating the whole purpose
of the benchmark.  The second one tries to be smarter about that, but still
has flaws--for a thorough discussion, see Hennessy (sp?) and Patterson's book
on computer architecture.

In fact, the translation from Ada to C is such that about all Dhrystone
*really* tests is how good the strcmp() and strcpy() functions are on the
C compiler you're using.  For that matter, I've read of at least one
compiler that notices it's compiling Dhrystone and does things that won't
work in general but give better numbers on Dhrystone.  Even an honest
compiler can notice that the source of a strcpy() is a string constant and
generate code more like a structure assignment (because the length is
knowable at compile time).

Opinions herein are solely those of their respective authors.

Just for info, I just ran ddtest on my 33Mhz Kix\30 while online
in Sterm and got 205 KBytes/sec write and 1,913 KBytes/sec read time.
I have found that the interleave value affects the write time
considerably.  I have it back to 1:1 because it gives great read
times at the expense of write speed.  From distant memory, I think
2:1 interleave doubled the write speeed and cut the read time only
a little.  I think I should have left it at 2:1.  This is all with
a Quantum 240 SCSI & DMA.

Also keep in mind that dhrystone results can be changed drastically by
the C compiler being used. As a matter of fact, the original version of
dhrystone went through the iterations calculating some magic number but never
used the calculated result. Since the result was never used, many optimizing
compilers found the loop to be unnecessary so removed it from the binary.

The bottom line is that you must use the same binary to get meaningful data,
and even then the results are questionable.

You are exactly right. I recall compiling dhrystone with Borland C++ 3.1
many years ago and seeing the problem with strcpy() and strcmp(). At that
time, Borland's strcpy() routine in the library was somewhat slow in that
it copied the string byte-by-byte until it found the terminating NULL.
With optimizations enabled, however, it determined the strings are always
the same length so replaced the strcpy() routine with the following code:

        mov     si,[Source]
        mov     di,[Destination]
        mov     cx,Length
        rep movsb

The difference was many hundreds of clock cycles in this one step alone.
The strcpy() function in the Borland C++ 4.51 library is a lot faster than
the originals, but so is the optimized version:

        mov     si,[Source]
        mov     di,[Destination]
        mov     cx,Length & 2
        rep movsw
        movsb

In other words, the original optimization used the 80x86 REPeat instruction
(do instruction, decrement CX, repeat until CX == 0) to move single bytes
(8-bit data). The new optimization moves words (16-bit data) followed by
a single byte move if the length is odd.

The new method isn't quite twice as fast, but it's still a lot faster. Then
again, I'ver never trusted benchmark results anyway, particularly with one
with so many noticable flaws.

Jamie, the easiest thing to do is connect one of your printers to the MM/1
using the parallel port.... or am I missing something here... the basic MM/1
doesn't have the parallel port maybe? If that is so, sorry for this! I'm not
that familiar with the configurations of the MM/1! But you are correct about
the Star printer, it is parallel.

Neither am I, but I believe the MM/1 does not come standard with a parallel
port.  It comes on the I/O board, that comes optionally.  It seems that
this would be one of the prime concerns, to have parallel output available.

Perhaps the thinking was that the MM/1 would be replacing a coco, so a
serial setup would be available, I don't know..

The parallel ports are on the I/O board which is the added board on the

of the serial ports on the processor board (at least I think it is) but I don't

The idea behind the MM/1 was to make it as CoCo compatible as possible.
That's why the hardware drawbacks (monitor support, which is the main
problem... support of a VGA AND CM-8 type would have been better) and
K-Windows. If you could program in Level II windows, you could go directly
to K-Windows with little or no problems at all. FHL was invited to help
design the MM/1, but declined because the "committee" type design staff
usually ends up with a well compromised machine. The only problem with the
KiX systems is the cost of a video card for a complete console system. But
it was designed for users who mainly use multiple terminals anyway. And the
special video card is amazingly fast! Frank had problems running the video
card at first... tried it at highest speed and got a white, blank screen.
After tinkering with it, finally started slowing it down. Problem? Video
card was faster than the monitor could handle! Phosphor didn't stop glowing
from one write before another was going over it... video card faster than
monitor!!!

The AT-306 was designed with functionality and cost most in mind. This meant
abandoning any CoCo hardware/software support, except for what can be ported
via traditional methods (no graphics though). Result is a much cleaner
design using current technology.

The MM/1 should have had a mention of how to use a serial printer with it if
was to basically replace the CoCo.  It didn't.  The only KIX machine I have
seen doesn't stay running more than 10 minutes without hanging up and the
owner STILL hasn't gotten his manuals. I really hope that the new machines
have all these problems solved.

Yes, that was the original design concept of the MM/1.  It was a worthy
idea, but I think the subject of a printer port would have been better
served by including a parallel port to begin with.  Of course I must
admit that this _is_ just a personal opinion.  I know that the design
by which they included a bare minimum of components in the base machine
made for cheaper entry, but when you consider that the purchase of an
I/O board was an almost necessity for productive usage, it just seems to
me that it would have made sense to have designed them into the system
to begin with.

Yes, it seems that the AT-306 _is_ a very clean design.  If I did not
have a system, I would give it some serious thought.  I might like to
give one a try anyway..<G>

then standard MM/1 systems. This new version fixes (or atleast properly
gets around) the long standing TIMEOUT problem (which wasn't cause by
timeouts at all, but by device read errors) While you may get"Garbled

I just have to finish the sz.c changes and beta packages will be ready
to send out... probably by saturday... Please send me email with your

Ya.. your CRC stuff is still in there... I hope you can find the time
in the future to add some more ASM optimizations for the 6809.


I've been haveing the darndest time in the last 2 days getting even the
OSK version to compile... I think my memory on my MM/1 may be going...
Something really strange, cause sometimes it will compile fine, and other
it messes the memory aloocation on the final executable (like trying to give
it several hunderd MEG of RAM!) I'ts really meen driveing me crazy... I
got the MM/1 in "spider" mode (ie, with the convertable top down) now, and
it seems to be behaveing... I finished porting the new sz code last night
and just have a few bugs in it to work out (must have made some typos).
Once I get that working, then I'll fire up m6809 emulator and try a coco
type compile... hopefully my system won't die all together before then.
If so, then I'll have to set up the C compiler under the CoCo 3 emulator
on my DOS box...

stuffs Wes G., Alan D. etc have been doing in the last few months. I've even
done a bit of shrinking of the 6309 version of rbf.mn, incorporating all the
bug fixes we've found in our combined tours of that code. Next project? rzsz?

I still think someone should tear apart cc3disk, and fix it so it can handle
disks with BAM's greater then FFF bytes... Then I could make huge virtual
floppies on the CoCo 3 emulator on my PC and have a better setup for doing
CoCo support of RZSZ...

Since when does it have a 12 bit limitation? I've not looked at the code
personally in recent history, but a 12 bit limit to the BAM doesn't seem to
make sense given the 16 bit BAM I'm used to on the harddrives. Hummm which
cc3disk are you refering to? I've got maybe 10 versions here but run the
no-halt 99.99% of the time. Its not given any trouble here other than its
not being compatible with either pc-dos or rs-dos, the two get/put utils
for foreign disks like messydawg etc.
Have you looked at the code for "myram"? AFAIK, it should not have any such
limits, and if there are any, its not in my code but in ioman or rbf, and
I can say that rbf is clean in that regard since at least ed28.
A 12 bit limit just doesn't seem to make sense to me. I run it at 1 meg all
the time (myram) here, but thats thru ioman/rbf, not cc3disk. Check with
Alan Dekok. If cc3disk has a limit, its the only known limit in the system.
(thats smaller than the $FFFF limit for rbf that is)

It indead has a 12 bit limit (cc3disk) limmiting floppy disk sizes to 1 Meg.
This has been verified. Why it was designed that way, I don't know... This
applies to all versions of cc3disk baised off of Tandy's original. I
don't know about others. A ram disk is just not practicle on theCoCo 3
emulator, since you are already limited to 512k, and ram disk access appears
_slower_ then virtual floppy access. It would be REALLY benificial to be
able to set up, say, a 20 meg virtual floppy, but wight now, that is
impossible with the current cc3disk...

I'd like to try SDisk, but I don't have a copy to test... If it worked, I'd
be more then willing to buy a copy from whoever it is available from.

Paul,

While you're working on rz, here's something to add to the wish list <what
else>

I've found that if you try to download a file and the filename already
exists, it apparently neither warns you nor attempts to correct this
condition.  In downloading QWK files, in PKZip format, one of my BBS's
always transmits the same filename, and if I forget to delete the old
file, my new file does not appear.  The new file has the correct length
for the download, but on unzipping it, all I can get is the data from the
OLD file. I really don't know what is happening.  Could this possibly
be fixed?  It could be the source for problems if not taken care of.

I've got to differ with you on this:

I routinely run a 10 meg vdisk, and some folks on the COCO fido echo
run with larger.

No problems as far as we can see. You do need to be running 1.42 of the
CC3 emulator, however.

I believe I have tried 1.42 (that was the update sent out earlier this summer,
right?) I'd appreciate a complete list of modules/patches that you are running.
Especially in the area of floppy access, and kernel patches... I have
repeatedly trashed out virtual disks over 1 meg as soon and I have copied
more then 1 meg of stuff to them... Quite anoying, especially after makeing
all them upgrade patches...

Well, my ram.dr that I uploaded here doesn't have that limitation, I have
experimentally copied 2 75=k floppies to it, and then copied them back, humm,
that s/b 765k above, an 85 track double sided floppy. I used the @ sign to
get it all going both ways. Worked just fine on my 2 meg coco 3. Slow? Well,
maybe, I get a megaread from the Maxtor at 12.75 secs average, an 11 secs
from the ramdisk, I figure the OS9 F$MOVE is the speed limit there.

Can I add this option on my end?  I always try to just delete the older file.

Yes, my new file is the same length as given in the ZModem header,and
also as reported by the BBS.  But all I see is the data from the previous
download.

Thats the same as a FAT, John. Stands for Bit Allocation Map, or File
Allocation Table. Means the same thing essentially, and what it is is that
area od an os9 disk that starts at sector 1's first byte, and continues
until enought bytes have been used up with each bit of each byte have
a 0 or 1 state that tells the operating system if there is anything
stored in the sector that the bit represents. Normally each bit equals
one sector, but under very large disk conditions it can be made to
represent any power of 2, as in 2,4,8,16,32 etc sectors. On the disk,
this means that the file descriptor sector, and the root directory
location on the disk are variable. With my 1 sector/bit map, my root
directory on this maxtor 7120s actually starts at sector $F3! Doing
the initial, after bootup search thru a map this big looking for a place to
put the first file written after bootup is a 15 second process even on
a 6309 equipt, nitros9 running coco3. RBF remebers where the empty space
starts, so the next write is much faster. And that is probably more than
you wanted to know about the subject! 8:)

OK...  The question of overwriting files is moot in this case anyway.. this
BBS closed down..  The other local BBS allows you to specify that the
filename gets a different number in the name... so it is not a problem
with it.

It wasn't a problem on the other one till I got hasty and forgot to delete.
Usually before a dload I'd just do a "dir *.qwk" to be sure it wasn't
there.

I have been trying the beta rz/sz with the local BBS.  Have had no problems
with it that I can tell - of course I must say that 3.24 seemed practically
bulletproof on my system.

I did notice one little cosmetic thing.. but does not affect performance.
With the -vv option, it does not report the last partial block, but this would
be more cosmetic than anything else.  I normally use this option since
it's nice to get a progress report.

Hi, and welcome to Ch.A.O.S. Country.  Welcome to the revolution.  The Cheyenne
Area Orphaned Systems, or Ch.A.O.S., is a club devoted solely for the
preservation of classic non-IBM systems, such as ours, and for the defeat of
Microsoft.  If we wanted IB
M compatability, we would have abandoned our systems long ago.  Those of us who
do have IBMs, but still use our classics, only bought them out of necessity,
such as for work or school.This is not a political organization.  We do not
hold any specific r
ight wing or left wing political views.  We do believe in fair competition and
Microsoft is NOT fair.  We spent all that time and money on our respective
systems because the performed the task or tasks we bought them for.  Wether it
be for gaming, educat
ion, office, or whatever, our classic systems performed upto our expectations,
and in some cases, beyond the original design.  Why should we abandoned
everything we put into our systems?I have been working on the designs of two
programs that I feel wou
ld unite all of our systems, yet retain the sovereignty or flavor of each
individual system:1.  A terminal shell with game maker to allow two or more
non-compatable systems to play games over the modem or in a mini-network.  Of
course, standard protoco
ls will have to be set between computers to ensure game play.  But, graphics
between two different systems wont have to be the same because screen data wont
be sent, just tiny info packets.  The games would take full advantage of the
graphics and sound c
apabilities of each individual system.  The games would be played as close to
real time as possible.2.  A DEVICE OPERATING SYSTEM (DOS) desgined on a
bi-level format:  The primary level is a whole new computer that provides
cross-platform compatability
 between our classic systems.  The computer will be based on the PowerPC.  This
will allow each classic system to be enhanced to that of at least a 486.
Without losing much compatability with the existing sytems.  Full compatability
is not guaranteed be
cause of the new enhancements to each individual operating system.  But, at
least you wont have to abandon your whole classic system!  The secondary level
is a whole new disk operating system for the original classic.  This will allow
direct disk access
communication between ALL systems.  Yes, even IBM.  Just imagine, a C64 computer

operating system with 38k free RAM, can now have as much as 3.75 Meg free RAM on

a 4 Meg System!  This is directly accessable without bankswitching or even use
as a RAMDISK!
  Just imagine the fresh, new applications that can be developed that retained
the original C64s flavor.  No, this is not limited to the C64, but to all
classic systems, such as the Atari, Tandy CoCo, VIC20 (YES!), Apple, etc.All
of our classic systems
 have their own uniqueness, their own distinctiveness.  That is why we refused
to follow the industry or marketing trends.  This would allow us to preserve our

systems and at the same time develop a cross-platform industry standard.  Who
says we have to
follow the Microsoft standard?  Lets follow a standard, sure, but we should also

be allowed to keep our systems we have devoted so much time and energy
into!Cheyenne Area Orphaned Systemsc/o Jeffrey Wood813 Covered Wagon

I do expect that not only may have crossed his mind, but some sort of a
scam was in the offing, 'cept of course to him its not a scam.
To: ALL (while I'm here), I've been messing around with the seriel
port in the 4n1, and the last seriel port on my amiga, the ka9q proggy
here on the coco, and AMITCP on the amiga. I've darned near got it
working! If and when I do, I'll of course upload the bloody details.
In the meantime, if anyone else has attempted this, and run into this,
give me some hints please. In the meantime, just to waste some more
bandwidth, here is a msg I composed offline.
Welp, I've got enough of the ka9q network program running here on the coco
that I am at least getting responses on the Amiga when I "ping -s 127 coco"
from the amiga.
That wasn't without a pitfall or two, starting with Tony D.'s non-standard
header pinout for the 10 pinner used in the 4n1, and finishing with my
adding the required additional buffers to allow rts/cts flow controls.
But, what I'm asking the network/packet/ham folks now is, Is there a Ping for
the os9 TCP/IP program KA9Q so I can duplicate the testing from the coco
end?
If yes, where can I get a copy?

Later, I have a bit more of it working! I can start AmiTCP on the amiga,
and "net" here on the coco. I can attempt to start an ftp session from
the coco keyboard, but it appears that things are out of normal order.
First, its several minutes before the response to the ftp comes back
from the amiga. The response that does arrive eventually looks ok except
for a lack of shell prompt on the coco. Entering "dir" from the coco
keyboard causes it to go thru all the motions that you normally see from
the remote sites response, except that the data comes back in short 1/2
second bursts at about 30 second intervals according to the sniffer lites
on a rs232 tester riding the nul modem cable, and eventually it says
"Transfer Complete", but still no shell prompt nor do I see the dir
listing on the coco screen.
Does anybody have any idea what "net" is doing with the data from the
dir command that comes into the coco?

Cheers all, Gene

You may have trouble deeper down... I had an old Epson MX-80 once that
got to where one (maybe 2) pin(s) quit.  I tried a different printhead
and all, but it still did the same...

You will probably have to get a new print head for it.  I got one for a Star
NX-1000 from Dayton, the guys that made the Blue Streak interface.  Also, if
they don't have any, there is a printer repair company called Laser Impact in
Austin, TX that can either repair or replace the print head.  Either way it'll
cost about $50.  There is an 800 number for them but I don't know it.

Hi, Brian -

As Paul mentioned in his reply, mail for Colin McKay may be sent to me
("KSCALES"; "kscales@delphi.com").

Colin's original Internet Service Provider left the business, and the
company that took over their accounts dropped support for the protocols
Colin was using, so he has not renewed his contract.  He will be shopping
for a replacement email arrangement.  In the interim, please send any
messages for him to me, and I will make sure that he gets them.

Very nice character assassination in a public forum, where the individual
is not even present to provide any rebuttal.

You probably are on the waiting list for the (recently shipped) NitrOS9
package.  I know that Colin would be the first to express his unhappiness
with the delays in getting the new version out.  He and Alan encountered
many obstacles in completing this release (GIME and 6309 deaths, GIME bugs,
hardware component differences, ... the list goes on).  Those on the
Princeton CoCo List probably have seen some of the history in Alan's
postings.  Nevertheless, the delays occurred, and shipping was delayed
as a result.  But they stuck with it, and began shipping the new release
a couple of weeks ago.

Certainly, few in this community have donated as much of their time
(without re-imbursement) to CoCo and OS-9 users as Colin has, from
fixing system problems for users, to providing a conduit for
the location and exchange of hard-to-find hardware and software
components, to his ongoing activities as president of the OS-9 Users
Group.  (In this latter role, most of his efforts are not even
visible to the general membership, but he has been very active in
making contacts, as evidenced in his MOTD column "Straight from the
Horse's Mouth", which is probably the source of your snide remark above.)
Colin and I frequently disagree on lots of things, but frankly I think
that we would be hard-pressed to find a more dedicated and active
president for the UG.

Please, let's take this to private email for any further discussions.  I
will forward any messages to Colin to allow him to personally address any
concerns you may have.

Ken, I'm not so sure we ought to privatize this, cause I feel like I should
be defending him too. Lets all take a deep breath and remember that for
even Colin, this is a labor more of love than any monetary gain over and
above the phone bills and postage used to do what has been done, AND that
at the same time, he has to keep a day job that feeds the wife and kids.
Thats why I've not done a lot lately too. With 2 machines to attempt to
keep up with, I'm afraid the coco doesn't get 100% of my attention,
probably more like 60% of the 20% of the available time compared to
the time I could devote to it a year ago.  For those that have sent him
a few bucks, I imagine you will get what you paid for when Colin is
happy with the code. 6 months down the road we'll either have it, if
you've got something coming, or if he can't deliver, your money back,
I think the question is, has he cashed your check? I got all uptight
with another over on another sig a year back, turned out he hadn't backed
up his drive, it crashed, and he had to re-write the darned thing from
scratch! But I was snotty, we agreed to disagree, and I stopped the
so far uncashed check after 90 days. I *think* Olaf Barthels "Term"
was the better proggy anyway.

The two people I know who have been waiting for months and the thing that is
getting them a little annoyed is that the stories are getting a little
inconsistant (in their opinion) and they feel they are getting the runaround.
I don't know if they ordered something already written or something still
being debugged but it would be nice to at least something else besides the
disks are being sent out each time one of them asks what gives.  It sounds
like the "check is in the mail" (grin).  I keep trying to say "Have patience."
but I think they feel it has gone on too long.  One of the individuals has
also been waiting months for manuals he has paid for from another vendor.
Too bad.  Could lead to people leaving for the PC world.

In light of the fact that one of them is squawking about undelivered Hardware,
not software, I do have a tendency to agree with the squawks. However, I don't
think he is dishonest yet. Just pinched with the everyday business of making
a living. You would be amazed at just how hard it can be to get back to
someone when you have moved, and can't find the information to carry on.
I've had that happen to me, and on my end it wasn't enjoyable cause I knew
I had people looking for me and muttering about what a fink that jerk is.
Things are much better the last 15 years, specially the last 10, got rid of

Hi Paul; Ya got the questions flowing over here. So I just did a dis on my
own cc3disk, a no-halter setup for nitros9. No place in it can I find a
thing that would indicate a $FFF limit for the BAM of a floppy. A limitation
of that order would limit us to an arbitrary 1 megabyte limit. So, since
there are people out there using the older controllers with 1793/MB8877's
in them running 1.44+ meg drives/disks, it sure looks like its a limit
of the emulation rather than any real os9 limit. I'm not saying there
isn't, but if it is, we've got more detective work than we thought.

How many sectors of BAM are we talking about? With a $FFF limit, thats a
meg, which doesn't make sense. I'll look some more, but so far, I can't seem
to see any code that would do the limit.

     Uploaded program: Lines.c
     From: KNOT1        To: ALL

Well my first MM/1 C program if significance is here.  I forgot that
they like to keep the description page short, so figured will post the
full one here where ya's only need to see it once, and can skip it
readily enough if want to. :-)

--------

Here's my first MM/1 C program (I've written others on the CoCo and
such).  I actually managed to do this with just a 1 meg system and a
single floppy drive, so shows you can do stuff even with the very
basic MM/1. :-)

What it is is a fairly simple screen saver, but one I rather like.
It started as a series of lines that bounced around, the old ones
vanishing after a bit.  Then I added colors and the option for using
boxes instead, or even having it switch back and forth.  This may
well have been done before, as I actually 'borrowed' the idea from
when I used to use a work station (well, the lines one, if not the
boxes).

It works very well with the upgraded modules, and the boxes mode
is pretty quick.  (If using the old/original drivers, as I had been
until recently, it can sometimes 'hang' after running a while..  I
believe that has to do with it mistaking LF's or CR's in the code
to draw the lines..)

I'm also including the source code with this, as it's a fairly
simple program but uses a variety of features, which might be handy
as examples for someone learning C, or if you just wanna play
around with it. :-)

Usage:  lines [{line|box}] [-n={num el}] [-p={pause}] [-s={switch count}]
Min/def/max:     /line/       1/10/30       0/0/180      0/0/10000

The 'line' or 'box' option is what type of elements it will draw (or
start with, if switching mode is on).  'n' is the number of lines
and/or boxes that will be on the screen at once.  'p' is the number
of ticks it will pause between each element drawn, if you wish to
slow it down, and 's' is the number of elements it will draw before
switching from lines to boxes or vise versa, and then start counting
over (0 means no switching).

I like to run mine as 'lines -s=500' usually.

It opens its own screen to run on (type 0, and assumes 640x208 with
16 colors) and sets its priority down to 5 on its own (yet another
'borrowed' idea from one I seen in the database here.. :-).

This is released as a 'Freeware' program.

Enjoy!

  I remember Mark wrote a small C program that would do it.  It was
in one of his mag's...  Also, you had to take the mm/1 back to a
one meg system to use this `test' program, but you could check both
4 meg sim's this way.

Paul,
 There are a couple of memory test programs that I got along with
the 8-meg board for the MM/1.  If I remember right, Mark G. wrote
them, and they require that the MM/1 jumpers be set to run as a
1-meg machine, but with the 4-meg simms plugged in - the program
then does a test on the 4-meg simms.  Sounds confusing, but thats
what I remember.  Anyway, if these programs would help you, let me
know.

     BAM problems?
     From: JMURPHY      To: MITHELEN

Well, even if the Bit Allocation Map
is limited to 12 bits, thats still a healthy
number of sectors:

12 bits = 4096.
4096 maximum BYTES in the map,
4096 * 8 = 32768 bits = 32768 sectors
32768 * 256 bytes per sector = 8,388,608 bytes.

Hmm, it looks like problems should be apparent
at the 8 Meg size.

I haven't filled my VDISK that full, and

be since both are produced. Can anybody enlighten me on this? I'd appreciate

I don't have an absolute answere for you, but, I am using the 9 chip variety
(actually, they may be 8 chip, ie 4m x 8 simms) I would imagine the 3

  Hugo,
   KA9Q is a amateur radio TCP/IP networking program. It allows you along
with a TNC set to KISS mode, to network via radio with other amateurs running
TCP/IP. You will need to get a 44.XX.XX.XX IP address from your local
coridnator (sp). You can network on HF,VHF,UHF, & higher ham bands.
  It can also be used with a Eithernet card to network with another computer.
I once setup two computers, both running KA9Q. One was also hooked to a TNC
and a VHF radio. It also had a eithernet card that was connected to the second
computer running KA9Q. I was able to use computer #1 as a router and use
computer #2 to access the TNC.
  Also computer #1 has access to the hard drives on computer #2 and vesaversa.
So it can be used as a local LAN too.
  Unless you have OS/2 or a OS9/OSK system, you will find the MSDOS version
takes all the computer time. That is, you can not run anything esle but KA9Q.
With OS/2, OS9/OSK, or possible Windows95, you can run KA9Q in one window
while using another window to do something else. There is now a version for
OS/2 called PMNOS V1.3.

  Hope this helps

  It can be used also to network two or more MM/1's or other OSK systems
together. In this case, assign bogus IP address to each system. Then you
can telnet (logon) to any of the systems or FTP (file xfer) to any of the
systems. This can be done via serial ports. It's a poorman's TCP/IP LAN
so to speak.

Hugo:

     The IBM PC version of KA9Q also supports the packet driver series of
ethernet card drivers, and has builtin ppp support.  I would suspect that
the OSK version could be interfaced with ppp as well, though it may not
support it "out of the box".  I think the CoCo version (which I haven't had
time to look at) is a slip only version.

Bob Billson and I saw it demonstrated at the Trenton Computer Fest several
years ago when they were just hooking up machines through the RS-232 ports
and sharing files, essentially both machines accessing each other's drives.
I guess we saw it in the early days since I have the MS-Dog version on
5.25 floppies!  BTW, KA9Q is the call letters of the person who wrote it
(did major work on it). It is still a "version" of TCP/IP.  It's getting like
the name Frankenstein being associated with the monster rather than the
creator of the monster.  Bad example I know but the only one I could think
of at the moment (grin).  If you are interested, I still have the disks
for the early (maybe non-packet) version and hopefully the bits haven't fallen

You are correct Jim. That may be one of the probs I'm having with it, the
coco version of slip may not be totally compat with "rhslip.device" on the
Amiga. But I'm still working on that.  I'll take any hints anybody can
throw out. One thing I've found is that the Amy stuffs just won't fly at
all if I slow the baud rate below 9600. With no flow controls on the
port I'm using on the coco, the seriel in the 4n1 with no patches done.
So rts/cts flow control is not usable until I get that hardware installed.
Lack of space in the 4n1 is the biggest hurdle.

Or, if things get really desperate, I could drag it off the earlier CDROM's
I have that actually included the source! On the Amiga, the AmiTCP/IP

  You should see a ping over 2M VHF radio. I am using the OSk version and
Kennth WB5ORA lives 3 miles away. It takes on average 11500 ms on a ping.
He is running a FTP session as I type this message.
  BTW, we just setup at work a old 8086 7MHZ system as a router. We are
using the MSDOS version of KA9Q as the router. (JNOS). Works great. Pings
are from 0ms to 2ms depending on the router load.

I take it part of that is the tr relay turnaround time? No, on 2M, you
should be running full duplex if you have good diplexers. 3 miles isn't
that many light years away. What box are you running on the 2M rig. I'm
not at all fam with the KISS stuffs, think I saw it run once at a friends
place up in Shinston WV 3-4 years ago. Some kind of a packet TNC he called
that one.
Gee, 11.5 seconds to ping really sounds like there is a major chunk of
molasses in the gears. Course I know that since you have to wait for
clear air at times, thats part of it.
The 2 ms is much more like it.

Humm, yeah, they're both set for 7, both ends. Haven't looked at it any
more tonight, been playing with a new dialer for the amy, 20x faster than
calling term thru a rexx script to do it, but I still haven't made it
bring the PPP'S together on both ends yet. So I thinks theres an error
and then hangs the modem up, I=it above.
If I get that going, I may drop this account, can't afford both. But then

  first there is TX startup delay. That is letting the xmiter getup to
speed before you transmit. that is on both ends, plus the clear air delay,
and ect. Remember when doing a ping over the air, you have delays on both
sides. All of these add up. my guess is the startup delay is in the order of
100 ms alone.
  TCP/IP over radio at 1200 baud is slow. If I could goto 9600 baud, I would
then see ping times around 1 sec. there are networks now ruuning at 56Kbaud
at 1.2GHNZ and 10GHZ. On these you can not really see any difference.
  One yes one other delay is that ALL TCP/IP and packet connects are
HALF-DUPLEX, since communictions are on a simplex freq. Up on 1.2 and 10 GHZ
you can run duplex real easy.

Typical values of TX delay seem to be in the neighborhood of 100 to 150
milliseconds. I think I've run my Yaesu FT-2400 down to 60 milliseconds
without problem. It's been almost a year since I've been on packet, though.
Around here the frequencies are too crowded with maildrops between FBB
systems. It wouldn't be so bad but most of 'em are to 4SALE@ALLUS or
something at ALLUS having nothing to do with anything.

Haven't decided to sell the TNC yet, but don't have much desire to work VHF

     CoCo Marketing
     From: MRUPGRADE    To: ALL

  The following is a reprint from "The UPGRADE" (#12 03/92) disk
magazine, by permission of the author and editor.  With the same
permission it was reprinted in UPTIMES magazine.   Though
opinion, I'd say educated opinion.  Insofar as I've delt in
Commerical CoCo software, TDP products, and headed one of the
largest Coco groups in the nation.
  A long post 118 lines.

       The COCO Market place,                (c) 03/92
              What, happened?  How?     by Terry Simons
  The main problem to our misunderstanding of Tandy's marketing
of the CoCo is simple.  We look from a different view point to a
different goal.  That is, Tandy wanted a Computer product that
would:
  A. make money in the face of competing C-64's, TI's, etc
  B. be an inexpensive introduction to buyer.  So you could
throw it away and buy a more expensive, big brother.
  Tandy accomplished "THEIR OWN" goals quite successfully.  From
the days of the gun metal grey, they made big dollars.  And the
truth is at least 70% of 'em hit the buyers closet in the first
three months of ownership.  I'd heard the same thing about
$2,000 Apples in th 80's.
  WE conversly; took "A & B" and saved money; while getting the
best of the lot for our purposes and adding "C"
  C. developed it beyond their wildest expectations.
   Using the sleeping power of the 6809 processor, Motoroloa
wanted to get rid.  What we often forget is "C" was never part
of the RS scheme, nor did they really even care.  Left up to
Tandy we'd still be using Scriptsit, and Spectaculator.  We the
tinkerers, are the ones who developed the CoCo power!
                The Marketing
  Whether we agree with it or not, Radio Shack has a franchise
system.  Any such system must involve and maintian standards.
You just can't let everyone compete with your franchisors,,, or
who'd buy in or work for it?   This means product control is
primary.  Keep support and repair within the system.  This
mainly worked against TANDY computers in a number of areas.  And
in other ways for them.  The APPLE and MS DOS opened doors for
the world to write software for their machines.  It's no irony
that the the machines who open thier doors to the world,,, were
chosen by the world.  The APPLE despite it's combursome
processor, stomped though and still stands tall in the
educational systems.  And we all know how the IBM faired.
  But Radio Shack was saying, STAR DOS is the only DOS.  And if
we don't write it the program doesn't exist.  Just as Radio
Shack salespeople (early 80's) were strictly forbidden to talk
of third party software or support on any of their computers.
For years any outside modification to a Radio Shack computer
would be removed before any service would be preformed.
  I called it the "Head in the sand policy".  It sounds much
nicer then "Head up your,,,, well... you know".  A little time
proved other brands were beating the britches off Model III & IV
computers sales until they opened their doors to third party in
about 1988 or 89.
  Well, actually it was more like they began to peek one eye out
of the sand,, or whatever.  From the CoCo standpoint,,, they did
a "toung in cheek" recognition of third party.
  They did recognize there was a RAINBOW magazine and could
discuss the existance of third party without the fear of being
fired.  With a sprinkling of third party demos in the stores,,
and you could express order some software,,
 i.e. 5 or 6 line discription in a catalogue.
  With the COCO this did work for Radio Shack.  As a dealer and
a guy who knew a large variety of users; I can tell you; Radio
Shack outsold third party software 10 to 1.  Despite the
superior quality of third party.  Now,,, are we gonna call them
the dummies?

  If you think Radio Shack is alone in this practice, you're in for
   a big surprise.  Try making lawn furniture and selling it to
a local "Earle May store".   Make a nice toy and approach a
local Toys 'N Us store.  You'll be told quite promptly; we only
take orders through the main office in...  One orante furniture
shop in our mall, has only items from India and, Tialand.
Prices; including every sale price; are set only by the head
office in another state.  It really gives meaning to "buy
local".  Just a few years back, Sears appliance parts lists,
were not available to independant repairmen.  Product and price
control are a part of what gives a corperations clout and makes
a franchise work.
  Buying a Radio Shack VCR opened a new awareness for me.  If I
buy it at Radio Shack, I'd better figure on paying whatever they
want to fix it.  As I was told by an independant repairman,
"thier parts are so expensive to me, it's simpler to replace the
VCR".
   Tandy might say they did make an attempt in '84 to offer the
CoCo outside the RS system under that name TDP.  A wholesaler
here in Des Moines layed in a stock of the TDP computers with
accessories.  After which RS dropped the base price another
hundred dollars!  Thus jerking the rug from under this
independant distributor (of their products) feet.  It only
happens once.  TDP lingered for a year or so; never seeing real
independant distributor support.
   It's no doubt a very accurate guess to say; The CoCo would
have stomped through the computer world, folding under the
Commadore, Atari, and any others.  IF it been marketed in all
stores like the C-64.  With a realistic incentive of buyers in
the local marketplace; Developers would have taken both the CoCo
2 and 3 software far beyond the mail order tinkerers.  The
problem with all this is,,, we have left reality in thinking.
What makes the Radio Shack and other franchise systems work is;
thier products are not sold up and down the street from that
store.

   From the beginning the CoCo sold; from an electronics store;
naturally to the type person who was more technical minded.  The
searcher, that tinkerer.  The exceptions; and I knew many who
bought CoCo 1,2's; finding a lack of convience (real support)
promptly returned them and bought Atari of C-64's.
   During and in the end, the CoCo was bought by us; The seekers
and the thinkers.   We love to seek and get excited when we
find.  We are not the majoriety.  We will spend the time to
experiment and learning, for thrill of discovery.
   Put it all together and you'll find: The CoCo was marketed
not for everyone.
     "It was marketed,,, just for us"!
      Third party,,, a story in itself.

  Part II "Third party", was continued in the Next issue.  If
you want I'll post is as well.

Please describe briefly your computer and OS-9 experience:

    I started out programming on a SWTPC 6800, moved to the CoCo1 because it
   had a 6809 processor in it. Did mainly assembly & Basic stuff. When i got
   a CoCo3 I got hooked on OS9, still just assembly & Basic09 programming.
   When I got the MM/1 I decided to get into 'C'. This is mainly what I use
   now even though I'm still not totally comfortable with the "C" language.

Please describe your OS-9 interests (things you would like to see the
UG do, or see in the MOTD), or list any other questions or comments:

       I would like to see some team projects. I think alot more programs
   would be out there if this was used. Nowadays, you can't expect the lone
   programmer to bring out killer applications all by thier self. The killer
   programs now need great graphics & sound along with good algorithm's. In
   my case my weak points are graphics & sound, where someone else might be
   great with graphics but weak at programming, or someone else might find
   sound programming a snap, but needs help with graphics. This team approach
   would also help the problem that pretty much all of us hold full time jobs
   and can only put so many hours a week in programming. Somewhere along the
   way we seem to have lost the kids(under 18), who were always pushing the
   envelope.

I think your the guy I have to talk to about this one. <G>

I seem to be having a problem trying to get my ram disk setup
with your driver "ram8.dr". Maybe you could point me in the right
direction.

I was using the "/R0" amd "Rammer" from the "Start OS-9" disk.
When  I try to load sound files to the ramdisk, it crashes.
(Free /r0) gives plenty of space. empty=177K+)

After reading your description, I decided to install your driver and
see what happens. I can't Iniz and format /r0. I disasm'd /r0 and I see
that the "drvnam" for /r0 is "RAMMER", as it should be since I was
using "RAMMER" before. Your driver is named "RAM". So far, by using
kwikzap to change bytes, I haven't been able to change either the /r0
"drvnam" to "RAM", or change the "RAM" mod name to "RAMMER".

Whats the best way to harmonize these things?
Xmode gives the drvnam option for /t2 type things but dmode doesn't
seem to for /d0,/r0, etc..


Any thoughts will be appreciated.

Welp, first, the download should have had the descriptor to fit it in
the archive.
Second, once up and installed, its totally self initializing! All you have
to do is open the first path to it, or even do a "dir" or "free".
Use the whole package, and forget about formatting it, it won't. Period.
As the docs say, the only variable in the descriptor that it actually
uses
is the "sct", oops, take that back, it also uses the "sas" value for
when it allocates additional space for a file. I have 2 megs here, so
my "sct=1000" gives me a ramdisk of a megabyte. Repeat, no other values
in the descriptor are actually used.  You can "deinit" it to remove it
from memory as far as the memory it uses being allocated by os9.
I haven't used the iniz command other than for a window once in a while
in my startup so I can't tell you if that works or not. Lemme try it.
Yes, that works, but why? It takes only a few milliseconds for it to
initialise itself anytime an access as attempted and it hasn't been
initialised.
I'd guess maybe 300 milliseconds on this machine to "iniz" it to a
1 megabyte size. I'm native mode here too, so that helps, but if you
got the .8 version, it should work for both systems in fact, just a few
bytes cleaner for the .3 version and marginally quicker, very marginally.
The access is only slightly faster than my hard drive in actual fact,
mainly due to os9's having to pump the data from either across boundaries
in the process map when it accesses either device. Megaread on this
130 meg Maxtor is 13 seconds, 11 seconds from the ramdisk.  But it sure
make the compiles run smoother!

I've tried "dir /r0, "free /r0", "iniz /r0", format /r0"...nothing works...
.just keep getting ERROR 221 (module not found).

Again, the only thing I can see is that the "drvnam" is wrong on my
"/r0". A "disasm" of my descriptor "/r0" shows the drvman= "RAMMER".
(Can't seem to change this to RAM and have it work, I'll try again tho..)

If I put back the "RAMMER" driver, everything works.

> ...the download should have had the descriptor to fit...

As far as I can see, neither archive "Myram" or Myram8 has a "/r0"
descriptor within it.

Well... I've done a little more screwing around with the "/r0" descriptor
and have been able to rename the "drvnam" to "Ram". There's a couple extra
fcbs listed in the "disasm" but I got it loaded and it boots Ok.

Seems to work alright so far (I haven't tried transfering sound files yet)
except when I try to do a "dir /r0".  This gives me a "253 - file busy" error.

I can copy a text file to /r0 and copy it from /r0 to disk. Just can't seem
to get a "dir".

Dom,

 In this situation, OS9 determines the end of a string (Ram, Rammer) by the
last cvharacter having the high bit set. So, to change the RAMMER to RAM,
all you have to do is set the high bit on the first "M". The other three
chars of rammer can stay put unmolested. Here's some instructions on how
to do it with dEd directly on your boot file (preferably a backup :)

 ded os9boot
 l               (link to a module command)
 r0              (module name in memory will be r0, not /r0)
 e               (enter edit mode)
 <Break>         (change from binary to ascii mode)
     (put cursor on first M of rammer)
 <alt><shift>M     (alt key sets high bit... on the cap M)
 <enter>         (exit edit mode)
 w               (write it to disk)
 y               (yes, really write it to disk)
 v               (verify, it will take a while, it will verify the whole boot)
 q               (quit)
 <reboot>

Thanks for the info!

Just downloaded dED with both sets of patches so I haven't had time to
try anything let alone make the patches. I use Kwikzap for any byte
changes but will check out dEd. (I like using kwikzap/kwikgen for this.)

Yes, <G> I do remember about setting the high bit and finally did set
it correctly...just kept getting everthing else out of wack. I couldn't
get it to verify at first. I have since tried setting only the first "m"
as you suggested and get three extra fcbs ("mer"). The resulting /r0
reacts the same as the one I first set tho..must be learning something. <G>

I'll try the change with dED when I get it up and running but I think
that I'll have the same problem I have now. I still get a 253-file busy
error when I try a "dir /r0". ???

Anyway, why does the other "/r0-Rammer" crash when I try to copy a sound
file to it? (seems to be plenty of space!)

It would be nice to know for future referance. <G>


Any thoughts?

Its booted, now to check, that was "myram68.lzh" on my drive, and you are
unfortchunatly correct, theres no descriptor! So here is a replay of mine in
the next

long
as the names first character is in the same offset location in the descriptor.

Hi again, Domm, here is a uuencoded descriptor for myram. I used the later
version of uue to do it, so use uud to undo it. Then put it in the bootfile
adjacent to RAM. This one is set for "sct=1000", a 1.04 something megabyte
drive. If you only have 512k, then use the latest xmode as follows before
putting it into the bootfile. Make sure the uud output is in the dir you
are in, the "xmode -r0.dd sct=400" which will make it a 256k size, half
of the 512k you prolly have.
Anybody else that had that same problem, grab this too.
table
 !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?
@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_
begin 644 r0.dd
LA\T +  A\8'( ", )K\    / 0        $ $      $4K!20L920<U.)'[Lz
 y
end
Now, uud should be able to grab this right out of the text download. If you
"cut" it out, cut above "table" and below "end".
That latest xmode is, if you don't have it, in the "Sacia.something" archive
in the telecom directory here. Its the only one I kow that can not only
modify in memory modules, but can do a disk file via the "-" option. Neat.

Thanks for the uuencoded "/r0" descriptor!

That was the missing link from what I can see. I did a "disasm" of your
"/r0" and see that many areas are zeroed out for your "RAM" use.

I changed the "Rammer /r0" with yours and all is well! <G>
(Can even load sound files allright!)

One thing though..

> ...xmode -r0.dd sct=400...

Can't do this! The "/r0" is a RFB device..must use "dmode".
Using xmode (which is what I tried using at first because it has a
"ddr" -device driver name option), gives the error "not a SCF device".
Dmode doesn't have a "ddr" option however.

Anyhow..the uuencoded "/r0" you sent works fine and I never before
"uudecoded" anything before, so I've gained knowledge on a few fronts.

What I will do now, just to test myself, is to take my "/r0" descriptor
and try to change that to match yours.

Thanks again for all your help!

Hi Gene,  I have been trying to decode your message containing "r0".
I am using uud by BOISY. What I input and what I get is as follows:

uud -d -t=/dd /r0/r0.file              r0.file is a capture of your message
Target dir = /dd
**** STACK OVERFLOW ****
error #207

I would appreciate any help on what I am doing wrong. The r0.file is on my
current ramdrive r0.  Thanks, Keith

Gee Keith, I have no idea! I used "uue", and DOMM just grabbed it and got
it decoded ok. One item I've noticed might be in your "settings" here on
delphi. Files I've grabbed on the Amiga, null modemed to the coco suffer
from linefeeds embedded in them. Seems like I've done a "tr 10 13 filename"
on several occassions to fix that. For some reason, UUE doesn't like to find
a $0A in the file its decodeeing. After doing that, you may have to edit it
in your favorite editor to remove the extracarraige returns that gives, AND
if there is a delphi "Press return for more" or similar in it, clip that
stuffs out. And I just noticed you gave it a bunch of command line args.
I usually just "uud filename", when its done, the original file will then
be in the working directory. 'smatter of fact, I didn't even know UUE had
any command line arguments! Prolly admitting my dumbness, but what can I say?
Hope this helps Keith, Gene

I wonder if anyone knows what happened to the three programmers
CoCo owners see on their screen?

Who are these guys and where are they now?

I was just looking over some Microware literature and was hoping
to see any of their names somewhere but didn't see anything.

Somebody somewhere must know. Seems like an interesting thing to
know since they still appear every now and then. <G>

Yeah.. thats what I seem to remember. Also the guy who left then,

     Colored Memory?
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL

         A recent post mentioning colored memory got me curious. Just
       what exactly is it? I've heard the term before, but never did get
       what it is.

     RE: Colored Memory? (Re: Msg 93542)
     From: RANDYKWILSON To: THETAURUS

Chris,

 Colored memory is a chunk of RAM that has a supposed dedicated usage. Being
labeled as such, the OS will not allocate it except for it's purpose unless
there isn't any other free RAM available. Colored memory is not a case of
"don't use this", it's "don't use this unless you have no other choice".

 In the case of MM/1s, where you most likely have seen the reference, the
video controller can only access the one meg of RAM on the main board.
So, in 3, 9, and 11 meg machines, this one meg bank is marked as colored
memory belonging to the video. OSK, when loading programs and allocating
data space, will not use this memory until all the other RAM blocks are
full.

 As a contrast, compare this to a clone machine with 8 megs of ram, plus
one meg on the video card. When that eight megs is full, you're done. With
OSK and colored memory, when the eight megs is gone, the system will go
after any spare ram in the video memory.

                1 - disto 4 in 1 controller

                power supply to drive both floppy drives
                1 - composite monitor
NitrOs9 w/docs

                1 - RS coco1 floppy controller modified to run hi density
                    ( not working )

                misc rom packs
                os9 level ii with books
                misc other hardware and hard cards + several other hard drives

                Tons of software and information that I have collected in the
pst
                8 years.

     since part of the above does me no good, I would prefer to sell it all at
one time.
But since we all know Coco users dont usually have a lot of money, I will
consider selling it in groups, NOT one piece at a time.

 Anyone interested in making me a resonable offer can leave a message here.
OR you can call me Voice  between  10am an 6pm monday thru friday at
    1-417-862-0837   ask for Terry.

Most of it has been done in asm for the utils. Major proggies tended to
be done in C cause it takes care of the housekeeping a LOT better than
we do if we don't keep a memory map on the wall, and a stack image right
in our source to keep track of what var is where! At least thats my technic
when running a new proggy in asm. For me at least, keeping track of the stack
can be/is a big memory (mine) prob. Thats my $.02 worth.

Yeah, but I forgot about B09. I haven't attempted to do anything for publication

in Basic09 since MicroWare changed their mind long about level 2 time and
decided we CAN'T furnish the RunB runtime translator WITH our programs without
making previous arrangments to license it as such. IMHO, a damned good way
to kill a good language! Which it is, anbd I have some nice stuff I've done
in Basic09. But as an sometimes author here, I will respect MicroWares wishes
and therefore have not uploaded stuffs for Basic09 unless, and I have considered

it, I just uploaded the source text only. That shouldn't be copyrighted by
anyone but the author. How about it out there, would some of you like to see
a version of Robert Moores "MaxIc" with a few more bells and whistles, and
which ACTUALLY works?

Actually, would this be a problem with CoCo Level-2-specific programs?
Since Basic09 was included with the package, anyone who has a legal
copy of Level 2 should certainly have RUNB already?  I'm assuming that
packed code is legal, as I have seen this in circulation.

It would seem that this would be no better.  It would appear that anyone
who would have Basic09 would have "runb".  I don't suppose the packed
code is restricted from circulation, is it?  I know I have seen quite a
bit of packed code floating around.  All that is restricted is "runb",
isn't it?

     Maxsound
     From: DGANTZ       To: ALL

I've already posted a similar message in the CoCo Sig but was hopeing that
there might be some experienced OS9'ers out there that could help me with
a MaxSound problem (MaxSound of course is a RSDos program).  I've been playing
with several audio digitizing programs to find one that would be suitable
to construct a number of greetings for my answering machine.  MaxSound seems
to be the one because of its sequencer.  However, I'm having trouble with
the sequencer.  Primarily because I bought my MaxSound used and there now
appears to be a missing disk(s).  The docs refer to a (M)axsound saved file
called "DEMO2" and I received no such files with the other original disk,
hardware, and docs.

My questions are:  Can someone xfer said files to OS9, lha them, uue them, and
mail them to me?  If not, does someone have a handle on the sequencer functions
and some time to spare to educate me?

Any help would be most appreciated.

Thanx in advance

     termcap
     From: TMF          To: ALL

I need help with Termcap for my SYSTEM IV.  I find that there are    some
really funky things that happen when I use VED or DDX or TTERM. When I am
using VED not under GWINDOWS I have to use abm85h termcap or I get some really
strange code before and after each letter or word . If I use VT100 or VGA I
get either the file starting near the bottom of the screen or to have funny
codes at the beginning and end of each word. I need to use vga for tterm due
to the lack of complete entry. To use DDX I have to use VGA , but then I get
the same thing for data entry as when I use VED. PS most of these also happen
with umacs. ~
   I sent a copy of my termcap to Pagan and he sent me a copy of P1\vga , but
to no avail. Help is greatly appreciated. BTW DDX don't work under GWINDOWS.
Somewhere there is happiness somewhere there is sunshine , but not here in
Denver. For the mighty termcap has struck out.~

     i2c bus
     From: ADITNAVEL    To: ALL


I was wondering if anyone has heard anything about i2c drivers for the MM/1
or the SCC68070. I was told that the drivers were started at some point,
but were never finished. If anyone could shed some light on this I would
appreciate it. I already have a call in to MW and they're looking to see
what they have, but we all know that is big $$$. Any help would be
appreciated!

     USING 80tr.DRIVES
     From: RONMAGOO     To: ALL

I have been a cocoNut since 1989, and although I have been picking
up OS-9 software at fest for several years, I am a slow learner.
I just recently started getting serious about OS-9. I discovered
that to do much, I would need at least a pair of 80 track drives,
which I recently acquired.

The first thing I discovered is, they won't read my regular disk!
That the 80 tracks will also format 35 & 40 tracks, and that OS-9
will read them, but not backup, dsave, or otherwise transfer to
them from regular Coco disk. I get 243, 244, & 247 errors.

I tried creating all kinds of boot cofigurations on both sets of
disk drives to no avail. Finally, I put one of each drive in the
same case. That worked! I can backup, dsave etc. in 35, 40, & 80
track and create disk that will work with the 80 track drives.

This still leaves several problems;

    1. Tandy didn't provide /d0 80 track drivers or an 80 track
       default descriptor. So how can one boot an 80 track drive
       from basic ??

    2. If you have to mix 40tr.& 80tr. in the same case you have
       no way to use a two drive system with either one, because
       I could find no way to make all 4 work together.

    3. The only solution I could come up with was to make a copy
       of anything you might possibly want to use on the 80 track
       system on a mixed set of drives before putting them back
       as matched sets. The only problem with this is that you
       either have to have a 3rd 40tr.,80tr.& power case to make
       transfers, or keep opening cases and swithing drives !!

Even with that solution, you still don't have 80 track default
to boot from basic with. Surely there must be a better way to
work all this out.

I would appreciate any help all you Ole "OS-9 Hackers" could
give this lost RS-DOS soul to bring me up to full OS-9 speed.!!
