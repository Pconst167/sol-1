Hello Gene,
  I was wondering about this same thing when I first logged on
this morning, 6/4.  There were about 28 or so messages in this
Forum in one weeks period.  Has everyone gone on vacation all
at the same time???  It is getting quite thin out here!  This
is not the first time I have seen less than 30 messages in just
a weeks time either.  It has happened a few times.  I can see
the lack of messages when everyone goes to the Fests.
  Oh, BTW Gene.  I have finally had GREAT success with this
RLL(MFM) HD.  I am booting from it, it is 100% restored and I
love it!  I do not have to wait for the HD any more before I
start the CoCo.  This HD is ready to go in no time.  I thank
you from the bottom of my heart for all the help and just plain
positive feedback you have given me.
  I have one of those external floppy drives that Tandy had
at one time (less the drive) and have installed the HD in it.
I have a fan mounted on top of the case to suck cool air into
it to keep it running cool.  I can actually leave it running
without worrying about it spewing its inards all over my desk!
  Once again, THANKS Gene and thanks to any and all who have
held my hand through this ordeal, THANKS!
  See ya among the stars...

Gee, I hope that fan is solid. The floppies supplies weren't rated for
what is euphamisticly called CCS. The fan will hold it for a while, but
I'd bet that transformer isaround 250 degrees down in its core.
I'd look around for a pc supply and hang it onto the back of the box, or
even lay it on the floor running the cable up to the drive box. Thats what
I have here, but it was big enough to run it all, 4 drives, the coco3 and
the mpi. The coco3, with a 2 meg ram kit, never rises more tna 10 degrees
over room temp even with a bunch of junk laying on the top! The only
problem is the noise the pc's fan makes, it needs a muffler. 5x noiseier
than the fan in the Amiga 2k on the next table. I have more mail so better
go.
Cheers, Gene, Gene

Hello again, Gene,
  The case my HD is in has no power supply.  I have removed it and
the cable connector as well.  I run the HD cables through the slot
in the back of the case.  As well, the power cable too.  I have the
HD powered by a tower case power supply, 250 Watt, should power
most anything.  One of these days I may get ambishish enough to
have that power supply run everything.  This Tandy external floppy
case is a half height white plastic cover that slides over a steel
chassis.  It was designed, I think, for their Tandy 1000 line of
PCs.  I have no worries about the fan keeping it cool, as a matter
of fact, I just reached over and touched the case in various spots
and it is completely cool to the touch. :-)  I just lifted it and
fealt the steel chassis and it is just slightly warm, not much
more than the plastic case.  My CoCo is definitely warmer then my
HD is!  I feel that this HD will last me for quite some time.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

Ahh Soo; I was preaching to the choir so to speak. Yes, the power can do
the whole thing. I expect if it sneezed, there isn't enough load on the
5 volt line to restart it. Thats been my findings here. Putting the whole
thing on that supply would be a great idea. The mpi is harder to convert
than the coc was for me. The coco went just fine till I tried to use
the seriel port 6 months later and discoverd I didn't have power on the
buffer chips for it! Nother jumper 4" long and the case top hasn't been
off since except to put the 2 megs kit in.  Rigging the mpi takes a bunch
of thought and circuit traceing due to that device having its regulator
reference chip in an odd place on the board. Once done tho, its all
coolsville.

Hello Gene,
  I do not know how long it will take me to make a decision on
whether to power everything from the 1 supply or not.  But, when I
do and if I decide to goe with it, you can be sure that I may have
more than my share of questions on the procedure.  I do have the
Service Manual for the CoCo 3 and I am certain that that will be
of great help.  I am learning to build curcuits from schematics in
this Computer Repair course and I must say it is most enjoyable to
build one and have it work right without seeing billows of smoke
rising.  So far I have only burned one component, a Zener diode.
I was working late and the lesson told me to place a resistor in
one connection and momentarily touch another component lead.  I
touched the wrong lead and the diode smoked and burned my fingers.
That should have said 'diode', 3 lines up, not resistor!  I only
had the 2 Zener diodes and I had future curcuits that needed both
so I bought a pack of 6 for the same price that I could have got-
ten 1 from the school.  Needless to say, I did not burn any more
diodes!  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

Hello Gene,
  I see the real need for an off-line reader now.  I think that
this message was in reference to my burning out a diode, right?
If it is, then I guess it can happen even to the best of 'em!
  From what I am getting, from people I talk to that know com-
puter repair, it has become mainly a matter of board swapping.
Well, more like board/device swapping.  In this day of compu-
ters, users do not want to be left without their "toy" for too
length of time.  So, the quickest and easiest way to get it to
the user, in a reasonable amount of time, would be "swapping
out" to determin the faulty device, charge the user for part(s)
and labor and send him/her on their happy way.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

This system has  a Disto 4in1 board instead of a Multi Pak. I don't
even get a sign-on or a cursor. After doing some testing with a spare
machine, I am sure something is wrong with the upgrade boards, but it
bothers me what caused it !  I checked several items on the Coco board
that were memtioned in the service manual. At least what I checked is
still OK. I just worry about blowing replacements also if I haven't
resolved what caused them to fail in the first place. Thanks for your

Humm, I'd almost bet a beer theres an address line messed up. This is one
of those that will nearly always require an oscilloscope (sp) to trace
out. I've got a good 100 mhz scope, but thats not doing you any good if
my probes won't reach to your 20. Theres a couple of folks here who can
do this sort of thing, Marty and Ricku come to mind first. ?Whats it do
if the SCII is pulled, do you get an rsdos signon then?

I do have a friend with an oscilloscope, but he says he needs a signal to

try pulling the SCII and see what that does.

Humm, not too sure the friend would know what he is looking at! Not having
a cursor is a very small item compared to seeing if the system clock is
actually ticking away at 1.879 mhz for instance. And that s/b 1.79 mhz, darned
fat fingers here. What I'm trying to say is theres lots more to check besides
the video output line in there. Strip it to just the coc and the monitor, then
see what you get, both on the monitor, and on a tv! The monitor might even be
at fault, thats why the temporary tv check.

Hi,

    Several people have been commenting on the lack of messages in the forum
lately. I believe that many people have been moving to Internet sources. I
check in here often myself. The Cocolist server always has more messages. It
also allows you to communicate with a larger community of users. As I said, I
still read the forum messages, but the real action now seems to be on the
internet list servers. If anyone needs help getting on a listserver, let me
know. You're missing alot if you don't subscribe! Thanks.

In case you don't already know....

A listserver is a host that maintains a "member" list. You "subscribe" to
listservers to be added to their list. Each subscriber mails to the list-
server and the list server echoes the message to everyone in the list. The
result is similar to a forum here, but you only require internet mail access.

To subscribe to the coco listserver, enter mail and then at the TO: prompt
enter :    internet"listserv@pucc.princeton.edu"

You can leave the SUBJECT: field blank. In the body of the message type :

SUBSCRIBE COCO Your Name

Your Name should be your first and last name. Then send it <Ctrl Z>.

You will get a message telling you that you've been added to the list. To
send a message to everyone on the list address any mail to :

coco@pucc.princeton.edu

If you don't like being on the list, follow the above proceedure but use
UNSUBSCRIBE in the body of the mail message. You will also get a message
from the listserver abouyt how to get more info on commands. Hope this helps.

I wouldn't abandon this forum, but it does expand your horizons. Regards!

Not to worry.  Memorial day.  Summer has finally arrived. People

As far as Internet access, its great, but we will ALWAYS want someplace

It should also be mentioned that the Color Computer maillist can be
accessed as a newsgroup via the Usenet reader on Delphi by accessing it
as "bit.listserv.coco".

This has several advantages over the mail method, cheif among them
being able to read selective topics, and do a nonstop read of all new
messages.

  Or if the UNSUBSCRIBE doesn't work, use SIGNOFF instead.  Some `List'
want signoff, and I believe the coco list is one.

The easiest way to connect to the list service is with Delphi's NN reader.  I
think it defaults to the alt.answers group.  From there enter 'G' and then coco.

NN will ask if you want to goto bit.listserve.coco, hit return and enjoy.

         Gene, I hate to be a pain but could you possibly send it again.
       I can remember getting it, but somehow, I must have screwed up
       somewhere, because I can't find it. It's possible that I deleted
       it with all my other mail messages by accident without extracting
       it to my userlist.txt file. That would be my first time doing
       this, but I can't think of anything else I might have done as all
       the other names are in the file.

         Sorry about the hassle :-(

         Btw, thanks all of you who have so far responded to my previous

Hi Chris,

  I have been using OS-9 since 1989 so I would say that I am
about up to my hips in that water!  As long as I do not get

  Oh, by the way, I forgot to re-send that form, but since the

Carl Boll (He set up the mail address when he was president.) was doing
most of this but for 1 or 2 months, and maybe longer,
I will be getting the smail. Carl is working in Mexico for awhile and his
wife, June, is collecting our mail and then mailing it to me. I expected a
packet this week but so far it hasn't come. When mail does come I will
expedite it .

Hi Dave,
  Well, let us hope I can answer all your inquiries as I am reply-
ing on-line. :-/
  As for the HD, I now have it up and running as an MFM, which is
what the drive physically and electronically is anyway.  The only
part of the kernal that is modified is the BOOT module. This is
so that the Kernal is loaded from tracks 128 and 129.  Floppies
have the kernal on track 34.  I have a disk that has the modified
kernal and the OS9Boot file on it only.  This for transfering the
"boot" to the HD.  I have another boot disk with the BOOT module
patched back to its original condition, this so that I can boot
from floppy.
  The XT-ROM, from B&B, goes through a memory test when first
powered up.  Then it goes to look for a boot on the HD.  If there
is one, it boots, if not it will automatically go to drive /d0
to look for a boot there and if found it will boot, otherwise it
returns control over to the ROM in the CoCo.
  I am now using my original CoCo with 6809 in it.  I tore the
whole system apart and cleaned all connections, blew out any dust,
etc. and so on...  I put the system back together with the 6309
CoCo and the darned thing crashed hard when tring to format a
floppy.  I pulled it and have had no problems since.  As a matter
of fact, and this sounds kinda strange, the display on my CM-8 is
much brighter with this CoCo than with the 6309, so...
  I have the memory checker that came with my first 512K upgrade
and I ran it on the 6309 CoCo for about 3 hours with no errors
reported, so I do not believe the problem is with memory.  I do
have the service manual for the Color Computer 3 but I do not
have any equipment such as an O-Scope to run any tests on it.
  About the HD running as an MFM...  I have learned, through all
of this that there is no difference between an MFM and an RLL.
This ST-238R RLL HD is nothing more than an ST-225 which has been
certified by Seagate that it will format out with 50% more space.
That's it!  The difference is the controller which is designed
to squeeze the bits closer together in the same amount of disk
space.  The drive is certified, given a new model number and
voila, you have a 20Meg HD that will give you 30Megs of storage
space.
  Well, I think I have answered some of the major queries here,
I know there were more questions but I have gone past the alotted
time that my short term memory will retain information.  If there
were any others that you need answered, just let me know.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

That is a sensible setup.  Makes it very versatile..  The only change
I would have made if I were doing it would be to check the floppy
first.  That way, you could have a "standard" boot on the HD, but
when you wanted to do a "custom" boot, just stick a boot floppy in
and go.

That sounds odd..  Could it be timing?  I've not had any problems with
my 6309.  My system got to where it would not format a floppy with the
MPI installed, never got it fixed.  What 6309 system do you have? Nitro
or PBoost?  I have PBoost, and found that they apparently have some kind
of bug in the piping system..  I was running an application piping the
input from an extremely long file, and the PBoost system was apparently
losing characters or something.. in the pipe.  I used a standard 6809-
style boot (with the 6309 still in) and the pipe worked wonderfully.

Hi Dave,
  First of all, if I want to boot from a custom floppy, I can
always put the MPI switch on slot 4 but, I can bypass the XT-
ROM with a key sequence when first powered up.
  As for the 6309, I was running it in "6809" mode.  I do have
PowerBoost, but I quit using it for one reason or another.  I
do not remember why, but there was a reason.  I have not gotten
around to getting NitrOS9.  I basically wanted the 6309 simply
for the fact that it runs quite a bit cooler than the 6809.

That sounds neat.  I never fooled with the B&B so I never did know
just how it _did_ work.  From what you say here, it sounds pretty
well thought-out.

I have my coco in native mode.  I have not really had any problems with
it, except I _did_ find that it somehow messes up on an exceedingly long
pipe sequence.  I didn't find out about this till less than a year ago.

I had rewritten a database-type program - well, it was a lotto analysis
program, I plan on uploading it soon.  Anyway, I had a pretty large database,
but didn't want to key everything back in.  I wrote a little filter program
that would read a text output from the original and send the data into the
program via pipe, whereby it would do the same input you would have done
by manually doing it at the keyboard.  I first did it on my OSK machine,
it worked perfectly.  When I recompiled it on the coco, it would not work
for anything.  It was obvious that some of the data was being lost somehow.
I studied for quite some time wondering if there was some kind of bug in
the coco library.  I tried the standard library (had been using the Kreider
lib) but still no go.   Finally, as a last resort, almost in frustration,
I booted up in 6809 mode and lo and behold, it worked !

I'm not sure whether I can tell a tremendous difference between the two
CPU's or not.  One thing is for certain.  mdir seems to be twice as fast
in native mode.

  Maybe this is something that the Hitachi needs to learn about,
if indeed it is a problem with the CPU.  Or, then again, it may
be that there is something undocumented about the way the 6309
deals with long pipes, who knows.
  As for the heat difference between the 6809 and the 6309, I
did see (feel) a definite difference between the 2.
  I was just thinking about the pipe situation.  I use HDbackup
for doing my HD backups.  Wow!  That statement took a lot of
thought! :)  Anyway, it uses some very long pipe routines and
I had no problem with my backups and doing 1 restore.  Everything
worked fine.  Oh well!

first! The HD63C09E was supposed to be compatible to the
6809...
it was a CMOS version of the 6809......BUT! unknown to MOTOROLA
they found there was more room to play with after they did the
retrofit
SO! they ADDED the extra functions to the chip to make it more
powerfull
.when Motorola found out,they just OMITTED the Extra
INFORMATION
on the NEW functions from the DATA SHEET......
The problem was .MOTOROLA just wanted a clone..and not extra
goodies!
Anyway someone in JAPAN found out about the extra stuff and
started to
find out what they were! hence the differences......
when in NATIVE mode,many things are added,and SLOPPY
programming
causes a lot of the trouble! WHEN a bit is added to a
instruction and the
programmer could not be bothered to MASK the bit,It comes back
to get one
later when the BIT is used by the new chip......that BIT do
something else
that you don,t want it to do!!!! and THAT is the cause of most
problems!

I don't think so.  It was the same cpu.. I just used a 6809-based
boot disk.  I suspect that there was some bug introduced in the
patch.  My guess is that they substituted an I$Write for an I$WritLn
or vice versa.  What appeared to be happening was that some of the
data was being eaten up.

Are you running in 6309 native mode, though?   This was when I experienced
the problems.

This could have been some fluke, but the same thing ran on my OSK machine
and also ran perfectly when I went back to "standard" OS9 on the coco.

What I like about offline readers is the fact that you can use your own
editor and I feel more relaxed this way.

Do you connect to any BBS's?  If so, do they support QWK packets?  This is
a real saver..  You download whatever forums you want and they are compressed
(the MS-DOS systems kind of insist on ZIP), and then you read them somewhat
like you do with InfoXpress.  I really love them... There are some available
for both OSK and CoCo OS-9.

Well, I am on the standard 4-hour plan.. Mostly I download the OS9 sig
and do a continuous read of the cocolist and comp.os.os9

I'm on CI$.  About all I do is read the OS9 and the Coco forums.  Their
Internet access is not quite as versatile as it is here, to my understanding.
All I've done there has been exchange e-mail with individuals..  I think
they have something like a $.30 charge for each e-mail packet.  I've
never gotten any big bills from there, but I try to be careful with my time
there, as I am here.

Hi Dave,
  I have not logged onto BBS since about '92 or '93.  I never
could derive the pleasure out of them that I can when logging
onto Delphi and with world-wide-access...  There is just so
much more to do and see here...  I cannot go to the UK or
Finland or Australia from a BBS.
  I just picked up The Internet Connection which is a package
of software and 2 videos.  Mosaic and Cello are 2 of the pro-
grams, which I really wanted badly.  I cannot download them
with my CoCo, well I could but would do my CoCo no good.
  There was also GENIE and CompuServe software and a program
called WinNET.  For $15.00 I could not pass it up.  Now all I
need is to have my 486 up and running.  There is also a pro-
gram out here called InterNav, I think.  I want to check them
all out, the navigators that is, I see which one I will feel
the most comfortable with.  I think WinNET is an Internet
connection software, not sure yet.  Nothing in the paperwork
except that it is a GUI with first month free and 5 free hours
of usage time.  Oh well!

I have been with Compuserve for many years but I really can't afford to be on
there very often. With the recent price reductions, we now only pay 38 cents
a min. U.S.  Convert that to Can $ by adding 35%.   Delphi is pretty good at
5 cents a min. Can afford lots of time here.
Now that I have this super OS/2  Delphi only  Navigator, its hard to be on
for a couple of hours a month.  Log on, download messages from 4 forums
(perhaps 200 or so) deliver any Email or forum replies and off in maybe 3
mins.  Manually it would be 10 times that long. Maybe I' m slow!
Really nice to answer mail off line and almost get it right <g>.
Can't think of any way to work OS9 into the thread.  But our moderator
doesn't care much.

 I've been seeking a low cost Internet connection for some time.  May have
 found one.

 The Company is NETCOM out of San Jose, California.  They are offering personal
 accounts for $19.95 a month.  For this you get 40 hours of prime time usage
 and unlimited non-prime time usage each month.  They define prime time from
 9 A.M. to Midnight local time.  There is no activation fee.  Service includes
 WWW, IRC, GOPHER, FTP, USENET, TELNET and E-MAIL.

 Down-side - I don't know if a regular comm program will work.  They provide
 a program, 'NetCruiser' at no charge.  But - it only runs under Windows 3.1.
 I haven't contacted them yet to find out whether other software will work.

 NETCOM can be contacted at 1-800-353-6600 or 1-408-983-5950.  I don't know
 if they have connections for our Canadian cousins.

 I'm not endorsing NETCOM nor their software.  With time, I expect I'll learn
 whether this is a good service or not.

Yes, that's true, but in my case, it costs quite a bit more <G>

I enjoy using the BBS's quite a bit.  I enjoy cutting up with them
although we could meet face-to-face rather easily, but actually, I
have never knowingly met a single user on one of our local BBS's --
and we live in an extremely small community..

I believe I've seen references to all these in time.  I think InterNav
is a really popular package.  We don't have a local internet connection
yet.  One BBS downloads a few internet newsgroups and the users can
read them.  I don't even know if you can reply to them or not.

With a lot of the newsgroups, I've found that there is a tremendous
amount of volume but many have very little useful content.  With some
of the more active ones, it is somewhat tedious to try to ingest it
all, and you sometimes cannot tell what the message is about by just
scanning the Subjects.  I read the cocolist and comp.os.os9 here.  Of
course many of the names of the people are familiar and these are mostly
quite interesting, but some of the other topics are not as thrilling,
at lealst to me.

I'm hooked!  I use InfoXpress for my composition.  Have you ever used it?
(it's for OS-9)  It is designed specifically for CIS and Delphi.  I would
sorely dread trying to go back to online composition now.

There's no way that I know of.  What I do with the cocolist and comp.os.os9
is to log on with STerm or other telecom program and read them nonstop
using buffer capture.  It would be neat to be able to do so, though..

Hmm... I wonder..  reckon there would be a way to adapt the scripts???

Hi Ed,
  $19.95 for 40 hours sure beats Delphi, but for the time being, I
am quite satisfied with my access to the Internet through Delphi.  It
seems to me that I would also experience long distance charges which
I do not with Delphi.  I also would much prefer to use software that
does not DEMAND Windoze, until I get OS/2 that is.
  At this point in time I am simply a casual user of the Internet.  It
is simply a recreational and learning experience for me.  Since
Star Trek is my main, for lack of a better term, passion, I just
read the Usenet Group messages on the subject.  I also go into
Paramounts WWW home page.  I do do an FTP from a site in Finland
about 6 months ago or so.     (/\ that should have been 'did')
I have never said that I was a great typist, but for not having any
formal training, I think I do a pretty good job of it.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

LONG LIVE OS-9! <FOREVER> ** In whatever form it is in!

Peace and Long Life...

Hello again,
  I am basically a casual user of the Internet.  Recreation and
learning...  I am a very avid FAN of Star Trek.  I go to the
Usenet and read the messages online.  All of the active, I
cannot think of a good term to use here... uh humm, how about
senders, have taken identities based on Star Trek and have an
ongoing story line where the participants write bits and pieces
of a story.  Reading them is like reading a Star Trek novel while
online.  It is very fascinating how they can keep within the par-
ameters set down by Gene Roddenberry.  They stay, definitivly,
in the Star Trek universe without swaying from Genes guidelines.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

I am an _extremely_ casusl user of the Internet so far.  With my setup,
it just costs too much to get deeply involved.

We are supposed to get a local access to the internet sometime this
summer.  As I hear it, our phone company may make the access available,
and also there is a BBS that is going to have some access.  Right now,
the BBS is providing something like a Net access to a few newsgroups.
They make a long distance call each night and download the newsgroups.
I'm not sure if they are offering reply access yet or not.

Your Star Trek group would probably be quite intriguing for one who is
an avid fan.  I've found that many of the newsgroups that discuss some
topic usually have a lot of exchange, but very little progress in
reaching a conclusion.

Just thought I'd drop you a note to thank you for your continued
dedication to the Late Night conferences!  It's really great to have
these updates continually stimulating interest here.  I know I started
to take these updates for granted lately, and I remember how dull it was

         Warning:I'm gonna get a bit long winded in this message.

         Thank you Joel, not only for the kind words but for your active
       participation in these conferences as well. As I've stated a
       hundred times, I could schedule a conference eight days a week,
       but if people don't show then I'm useless. Luckily it hasn't
       gotten THAT bad. We've had ups and downs, which you know you're
       going to have anyway, but it has been a pretty positive experience
       I think. Really, running the conferences are not very difficult at
       all. You basically write up the schedule(my format is 2 months per
       update, to make it even easier, and to allow time to promote and
       build up certain conferences), and show up on Monday night. Even
       then if I can't show on Monday, hey I leave a note in forum and/or
       to Mike Rowen to tell people just to go on without me<my actually
       being isn't even really necessary most of the time when you think
       about it).

         When I originally started this, I promised myself it wouldn't be
       a 'one-night-stand' deal. Others set up conferences in the past
       and failed to keep them going due to lack of interest, and I
       wanted to make sure that this would be a long term success, unlike
       those. 'Course Boisy's OS-9 Live! was an exception(wouldn't mind
       seeing that again). He just had a million other things to juggle
       and Late Night happened to be there to pick up the slack. While we
       will have off nights and mishaps, I try and keep things
       interesting(the hardest part of my job), so that it maintains long
       term success. You'll notice the next schedule to come out will be
       Augest/September. You'll never guess what Augest is? Our 1 year
       anniversary! I can't remember if any of the other 'classic'
       conferences ever lasted that long? I think we've all done a pretty
       good job. We have to keep it up! This conference is nothing but a
       small symbol of how we should all be active somehow in the OS-9
       community, and a token of of my appreciation to those of you
       software developers, Vendors, User Group leaders and magazine
       publishers who keep things running. I want to be able to give at
       least a little back and maybe use this conference and 'that UG
       project of mine'<Grin> as a springboard for future developements.
       We all have to get our hands dirty, no matter how much or how
       little we do. I think you can relate to that.

         Anyway, did I ramble everything yet? Oh, if you ever get the
       time, go download the transcript of the  first conference. I was
       reading it just yesterday and it was such a trip, because it seems
       like yesterday that we were just starting out. There I was,
       wondering if the conference was gonna hold up for a month<grin>.
       Luckily persistance paid off, and now OS-9 Late Night is a
       permanent fixture on Delphi and the Online OS-9 world.

         Another thing, check my upcoming post(maybe the next one, maybe
       not), for a special update to the conference schedule. I've
       finally been able to confirm a conference I've been trying to get
       for months. It will be of extra interest to a DAVID guy like you
       Joel! :-) Now if I can just get Delphi to let me put it on their
       signon banner!<G>

         >>Hope you know we all appreciate your efforts!<<

         And I certainly appreciate everyone's support in keeping this
       machine going. C'mon everyone, one year is nothing. The OS-9
       community certainly has changed over the last couple years and a
       lot of 'leadership' has jumped ship in some form or another. Let's
       get behind the new leaders such as the  new OS-9 UG president and
       VP as well as those who are marketing new products for OS-9. If we
       stick to it and stay supportive in many ways, we can carve our own
       little niche in the computer world that is rightfully ours. I plan
       on bringing 'Late Night' along for the long ride! Ok that's it,
       sermons over(Brother Jeremy, you're really much better cut out for
       this than me :-) ). I could probably think up more to say
       but....(running for cover)

Yes, Dave Kimble is an excellent pick for the DAVID chat.  He's an
exceedingly nice guy and terrific at explaining things.  I'm looking

Yes, great work setting it up.  This should be billed heavily to make
sure everyone who may want to attend knows about it far enough in
advance.  Plaster the coco and OS-9 listservers with messages and
updates, along with forum and anywhere else you can find.  This is
finally a chance for the "underground" community to find out what DAVID
is all about.

I know I'll be there.. at least to hear what is going on.  A big Thank
You to you and anyone else that got this pulled off.

  And I just can't say thank you enough for your effort in doing these
conferences.  Yea, I know, if nobody showed, there wouldn't be a conference.
True.. But, if we weren't reminded, I think we would forget fast :)

       conferences.<<

         It really is. Since you have been attending since we began about
       a year ago, I'm glad to see your the one to tackle the IRC
       conference project. You have seen firsthand all the ups and downs
       Late Night has had as far as attendance is concerned. Even the
       topics began drying up there for a little while. Hopefully this
       will leave an impression on you later on when you get the
       conference(s) up and running, so you will know that yes, you WILL
       have slow nights and stretches of them, with all the outside
       factors you will have to face. Just let those negative stretches
       come and go and things will always bounce back up, assuming the
       people attending put enough effort in to keep things interesting.
       It's going to be far from perfect, but from my experience, I think
       riding out the downtimes has helped establish Late Night as a
       reliable long term conference, rather than a flash in the pan.

         >>Keep up the great work!<<

         And don't think I'm going to let you take all my Late Night
       attendees to IRC with you. If I start drying up, then I'm going to
       sneak over their and rename your group name to "GOOD NEWS". That
       oughta scare them back here<Grin>.

         Thanks Mike, and good luck!

         This is going to be interesting to see which way this turns out,
       because from all I can remember, this is most likely the first
       such topic we've had which dealt with OS-9 in a more mainstream
       setting. Most of the past conferences have been geared towards
       vendors and new product releases,programming and general OS-9
       usage, or community related events(fests). This is something I
       still want to do(if any interested vendors or individuals will get
       in touch with me), but since OS-9 exposure is growing, I thought
       I'd make some changes in my 'Late Night Programming'(ok, everybody
       slap your knees for that one<Grin>), to reflect that and to start
       lending more attention to where it stands in the real world. I
       noticed that the past Late Night topics almost all were popular
       with the current 'inner circle' users such as those on
       Delphi,Fido, and the Cocolist, and had strong Coco ties. Not that
       there's anything wrong with that(and I will continue pursueing
       topics in that area in the future), but that's ALL we were doing
       and not really lending much attention to what is outside of this
       'circle' such as D.A.V.I.D.

         I do plan on making a few slight changes now in the way Late
       Night is done. For example, when possible I want to try and land
       one BIG conference at the end of each scheduling period. This
       makes for a neat format, and allows for me a month and a half or
       more to build the big one up while at the same time pushing the
       smaller ones as we go. Some ideas I've had for these BIG
       conferences would be more in line with such things as D.A.V.I.D,
       in hopes that this is the start of something good. CD-I related
       topics(developement, marketing strategies, and discussions with
       people in that field), Rave/multimedia related usage and
       programming, and maybe even try to get some of the famous folks
       from OS-9's past and present online, is where I'd like to go.

         In what is my own personal curiosity for what the smaller Coco
       Clubs and OS-9 user groups are doing across the country, I'd like
       to get a representative from 1 or 2 on each schedule to give them
       an opportunity to let us in on what their clubs are up to. I know
       the San Diego OS-9 users group has a cool sounding project going
       on , and are pushing OS-9 locally from what I've read on the net.
       These are people I'd like to get online in the future, as well as
       Daltrug,Toronto OS-9 Users' Group,Glennside,Chicago Area OS-9
       Users Group,ACS, etc, you name 'em. Late Night is a good medium
       for such small clubs who could use the exposure. Add that to the
       fact that I am toying with the idea of incorporating the
       conferences into an MOTD series in the future, and you could have
       even MORE exposure. I believe in stretching the buck, so I am
       interested in finding a way for all these activities to benefit
       from eachother in different ways. Late Night and the MOTD could be
       a heck of a tool in this regard.

         This is something I am working on now. I'm going to write to

       of points in favor of D.A.V.I.D getting the Delphi wide
       recognition. With the service being on the whole Multimedia/techno
       trip right now, it is a logical possibility<just look at the
       exposure stuff like Fox's _Sliders_ and other such programming
       gets in the banner. Late Night will have a much longer run than
       Sliders' I'm happy to say :-) ). Unfortunately I'm not familiar
       with how they handle such requests. Also I do want to check out
       the Multimedia related forums including Custom Forums and see if
       the SIG managers mind if I post an announcement there.

Excellent ideas.  I would think Delphi would be willing to have a
signon/signoff banner if they know how big this is... not just to us,
but this conference can have a wide appeal.  Whether they'll figure out
how important it is... that's another matter.

     The World of 68 Micros(new issue)
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL


         Well I just recently, say a couple days ago, recieved the latest
       issue of 'The World of 68 Micros'. I was just wondering if
       everyone else recieved theirs' and how'd ya like it(yes, I'm
       trying to kick up some conversation<G>)? I thought it was good as
       usual and it's nice to see Frank has been able to stay very
       consistent, being as busy as he must be. All I have to say is, I'm
       probably Chris Dekker's biggest fan right about now, after
       following his series on Basic programming. If this article alone
       was the only one in the mag I think I'd keep renewing anyway :-)
       Frank, don't let this one get away! It's nice to see more Basic09
       than just what's in the manual and tour guide.

         Btw did anyone see the add for _Mastering OS-9_? I guess it's
       ready and out now. If you've already bought it(I do plan on making
       a big, MOTHER_OF_ALL_PURCHASES from Farna in the somewhat near
       future, with this book included), let us know how it is. Maybe
       someone can write up a review?  Anyway, once again, good job
       Frank, and keep it up :-)

         And since I'm on the subject of magazines and articles...There
       are quite a few newsletters and mags out there(ok, mostly
       newsletters), that will be happy to print your articles. We have
       not only 'The World of 68 Micros', but also, the 'MOTD',Glennside
       Color Computer Clubs newsletter, 'Coco 1-2-3', as well as MI&CC
       club diskletter 'The Upgrade'. There are others out there also,
       catering to their specific Coco Club. I imagine the San Diego
       Users' Group and Daltrug have respective newsletters. We should
       all help these publishers out and put that knowledge to use at the
       same time. There is plenty to write about as it relates to OS-9
       and the Coco. New Products, system management,programming, current
       events and other things that we take for granted online, could be
       put in article form for others offline to appreciate.

 Just chiming in. Yes, I got my 68 Micros too and thought it was a very
 good issue. And like you, I enjoy seeing the BASIC09 code and
 explanations of system calls. Stuff to grow on...

 Lately I've been messing with CDL BASIC. A lot of promise there if one
 can figure out how to do the advanced stuff. I believe I have system
 calls from within CDL mastered and have also successfully created
 a signal handler. However, when I combine the signal handler with a
 system call to read the mouse very strange things happen! Seems like
 with the signal handler installed, the system call to read the mouse
 no longer puts the mouse values in the variable pointed to by a0.
 Trial and error learning is sure a pain, but then two weeks ago I
 couldn't fidure out how to do a system call.

The new version of "Start OS-9" was retitled "Mastering OS-9" as this is
more consistent with the content. All the info files have been revised and
updated, and some have been added from Rick Ulland (making boot disks the
easy way!). The tutorials were all rewritten to be easier to follow with
fewer, but more logical, steps. And best of all, there is a complete INDEX
and easy to find references in the sidebars of every page.

         I'm the type who can really never get quite enough information.
       I wish they had a whole new book on Basic09 programming(I've got
       Hiiiiiigh Hopes...), since the B09 section of the OS-9 Manual
       still leaves some to be desired. It's not that they didn't put a
       lot in there are just so many techniques that can be used that
       could fill a whole book. Looking over other people's source
       listings in 268m is helpfull, since I like to see how the more
       experienced people handle such things as syscalls and graphics
       programming, array structuring, and all that neat stuff. It's fun
       to read about and learn but once your actually programming and
       getting stumped for too long a time, it can be painfull<G>. OS-9
       Underground also used to have some real neat B09 listings before
       they started mailing out the new style transparent issues<G>.

         Btw, didn't you have an article in 268m recently, or as I
       believe, some of your code was published? I believe this is the
       first one I saw that demonstrated using escape codes to achieve
       gfx2 type graphics calls. For some reason(inexperience?), while it
       is perfectly logical(gfx2 calls are basically escape code
       routines), it never did dawn on me that this could be done. Thanks
       for shedding some light ;-)

         >>Lately I've been messing with CDL BASIC.<<

         It is nice to finally see a REAL BASIC compilor for OS-9! I take
       it you like it so far? While I do intend to learn C(am starting a
       programming AD course in college), I think CDL Basic would most
       likely be one of my first software buys when I go OSK. I can't see
       me getting a system without it. Is there any reason to use Basic09
       do you think with CDL. Are there still any advantages to it?

         I'm glad you are getting the hang of it. We could sure use more
       OSK developers, and it will be cool to see CDL Basic attract some
       of them(you already have a product or three on the market don't
       you?). If you get a chance, let us know when you work out the
       mouse problem. I've been getting the hang of Syscall a little
       better but still am a bit illiterate on it<G>.

 Yes, that was me. Joel published code of mine in perhaps four issues.
 Last summer I was spending quite a bit of time working in Microware
 BASIC and sharing my discoveries with him, who in turn shared them
 through his column in 68K Micros. Since GFX for OSK was unavailable
 at the time, anything I wrote used escape sequences. They were much
 faster when used with PUT than either calling BGFX or a shell so I
 recommend that approach to graphics programming in BASIC highly.

 Its still early for me to make a call on this. I've figured out how to
 do system calls and KWindows graphics with it. One needs system calls
 to do essential programming chores like read the mouse and sleep. I've
 also got a signal trap working in CDL BASIC but when I combine the signal
 trap with attempts to read the mouse it fails. One needs a working signal
 handler with mouse and keyboard reading to build a good main loop for a
 program. If I get passed this hurdle, then I'd say CDL BASIC is the way
 to go. I think one thing you would like is that CDL BASIC has some C-like
 characteristics so its a good intermediate step on the learning curve
 between BASIC09 and C.

 My only commercial venture in the CoCo days was DeskTamer which is
 currently ported to the MM1 under MICROWARE BASIC. I'm now
 playing with CDL BASIC in the hopes of moving DeskTamer to it so I
 can release a version that would be quicker and not need support code
 (i.e., RUNB)

Desktamer is quite a nice looking program, with lots of features.  I
think I saw an early C version at WCP's booth at the fest.  Either way
(C or CDL BASIC) it would be great to get rid of the RUNB support code
and get a little speedup as well.

Yes, I've seen parts of the OSK version and it looks great... It's

 Hi Joel!

    Well, I may have some CDL BASIC code for ya in the not too distant
    future! Are you going to continue with your column in 68K Micros?
    Hope you will have the time for such writing!

   Thanks! I'm working on exactly that though my current impression is that
   the change from Microware BASIC to CDL is greater than the change from
   BASIC09 to Microware's BASIC for 68K. (Or maybe its just that learning
   gets harder as I get older!)

   David,
     I'm always eager to share stuff that I learn. I'd give it a shot if
   I could write during the summer. Once school gets started its harder
   for me. Maybe useful functions for CDL BASIC or doing system calls in
   CDL BASIC would be a good topic?

   Actually, there is a CoCo version that was sold by MVSystems before
   they got out of the CoCo business. The MM1 (commercial) version is
   not yet complete, though there is a BASIC 68K version for KWindows
   and the MM1.

       time, we will be having our weekly 'OS-9 Late Night' conference.
       The topic this week will be 'Let the Games Begin'. What are your
       favorite Coco and OS-9 Games? Between what is available for
       DECB,Level II, OSK, and CD-I, there are a lot out there! This also
       makes a great forum thread(a similar one was started on the list).


         I will also most likely post a reminder on Sunday, but if you
       need to read the whole schedule it should be in the conference
       banner area soon. Also, Mike Rowen will be posting it on the
       internet. If you have a conference you want to host let me know,
       and try me if there are any you want to see. No guarrentees but
       I'll see what I can do. I am taking names for the Augest/September

     Trip Troubles
     From: MODEL299     To: DSRTFOX

Sorry to hear about the troubles you had after the show.  For our group the
problems were on the way to the show.  I have a camper and we all load our
stuff in there.  On the day I started out I had to make 3 stops to pick up
the rest of the gang.  About 2 miles down the road after the first stop we
heard a loud BANG from the rear of the camper.  We stopped and did not see
anything so we started out again.  At the next guy's house we checked again
and saw a piece of tire tread missing from the inner tire of the right rear.
This cost about $186 and 90 minutes to fix.  We picked up everyone and
started out from Omaha for the show.  About 80 miles down the road I looked
at the instrument panel and thought "That really ought to be charging the
battery".  When we got to DesMoines we asked directions to an auto parts
place.  We replaced the alternator brushes for about $5 and a 30 minute
delay this time.  This worked and we were on the road again.  While going
down the road we occasionally smelled burnt rubber.  At one of the gas
stops we saw that when the tire place swapped tires to put the older ones
on the outside they had not checked the clearance between the tires and the
fender.  The inner tires were moved to the outside so they would be easier
to get to in case of trouble.  This seemed to make sense because the new
tires would not likely have any problems.  However the old inner tires are
a bit wider and scuffed the fenders when going over bumps.  We got to the
show and I swapped the tires around the next afternoon.  When that was fi
finished I took the camper out for a short test and to get supper.  About
half way there I noticed that the speedometer was stuck at zero.  I had a
busted cable.  By this time it was dark so I got out a small 12 volt light
my wife bought for me.  When I plugged it into the cigarette lighter there
was a small click and the dome light went out.  BLOWN FUSE!!!  Aafter this
no further repairs were attempted and the rest of the trip was problem free.
At times I was tempted to ask "WHAT NEXT??!!".  But then I decided it might
be safer not to ask.  You can consider this a letter to the editor and print
it if you wish.  Take care and hope we both have better luck on the road.
    Mark

     Help a Monk
     From: REVWCP       To: ALL

Dear Friends:

I am in the midst of working on a project and I need to know if it is
possible to write a program, preferably in Basic09, that can do the
following:

    1.  Determine if the CPU is a 6809 or 6309.
    2.  Determine that if the CPU is a 6309, is it running in
        6809 emulation, Powerboosted Mode, or Native Mode.

Thank you for your help.

Br. Jeremy

  Not too long ago, I gave Ricku a Basic09 routine that would determine
if the system was in normal (6809), PowerBoost (normal), PowerBoost (native)
or Nitros mode. If in normal mode, it could not determine between a 6809
and a 6309. Indeed, I can not think of a way to do that from Basic. The
only strategy I can think of would be to try a 6309 only instruction
(the 6809 will ignore it as illegal) to modify a testing value. This
would require direct access to machine instructions, assembler. Though,
I suppose such a thing could be made as a subroutine callable by basic.

 If Rick does not have the routine handy, I might still have a copy I could
email.

bit - 0   returns 0 if in 6809 mode
                  1 if in native mode

                  1 if    same as IRQ    ........these are WRITE bits
6 & 7 are error traps
                        read bits......if one could READ the BIT 0
 it would tell one if you was in Native mode or not

Rick had one of his famous system crashes last week.  I missed it, as I was
not at the meeting that night, but I understand it quite spectacular.  If
possible, please see if you still have a copy.  As for assembler, this
could very well be the excuse that I have needed to get assembling (?).  I
have both RMA and ASM so there is really no reason that I shouldn't try writing
something, other than having no idea where to start.  But then I was never one
to let knowledge stand in the way of my making a decision....

Heh heh, good idea, Randy! Rick's coco's can do a lot more than any
ordinary CoCo... the only problem is it can only do for a random amount
of time before crashing.  <g>  (Just teasin' you, Rick, since I've been

covering what you need to do.  I don't know the most efficient way of
searching for it, but something like:
                   dir from kscales subject logo

might do it.  (Before sending this, I logged in and checked... the above
worked, and listed 4 messages.  Check 21841, 72314, 81858, and 81967.)

You're half-way there by using the VDG screen.  The
other trick is that DL Logo ONLY UNDERSTANDS COMMANDS IN CAPITAL LETTERS.
So, you can either press shift whenever typing your commands, or toggle
caps-lock on (lessee, I think that's Ctrl-zero under L2???), or possibly
type "tmode upc" (???) on the VDG window before executing Logo.

Otherwise, I don't think any patches are required.  I found it advantageous
to patch the Logo module to increase the default memory size, since L2
leaves a larger available area for the data area than L1 did.

Sorry about all of the "???" above, but my Level 2 is getting awfully rusty
since the MM/1 moved in.

Good luck... / Ken

heh-heh..  It doesn't take long for some of that stuff to get a little
foggy, does it?  I still have my coco hooked up, go back to it occasionally.
It's like meeting an old friend, but some of the stuff is beginning to
go.  The worst problem I have is the keyboard and the fact that most of
the parameters on the coco don't take the "-" before them <G>

If you run into problems, just ask.  One thing you'll find out about this
group is that everyone is more than happy to help.  I've asked a few
questions and been almost swamped by answers at times.

     From: MRUPGRADE    To: ARTFLEXSER (NR)

  I'm adding the Internet reply here, for what it's worth.  Primarily for
 theh benefit of others ofcourse.   I (grin) thiink you've seen it by now.
 RE>  Until your post I've always read "& Country" Kinda like
      Kountry Kitchen....

  Hi Art,
   A good point.  And I've at least suspected many read the Mid Iowa
and ignored the & Country.  Course now,, little did I suspect some
would read it as like,, (grin) "& out into the corn fields too".
Yet I know there could be a better discriptive Club name.  But then
some of the members balked at the mere adding of "& Country to our
local group".  The best I could get them to accept was a motion to
try it for a year,,, and they (grin) forgot, thus any "change back"
was forgotten.   Then too, at times we've had more members in either
AZ or WA then in Iowa.  And they all can vote on any major change.
  And perhaps too, it my despise for pretensiousness.  Many like
yourself make no bones, about who you are.  A heck-uva good
programmer (perhaps, an understatement at that) who sells a heck-uva
greal DOS enhancement.  On the other hand I've recieved 5+ page
flyers from McBigTech, Inc type fellows.  And there name can't be
found anywhere in those 5+ pages?  I guess I'm suppose to figure
it's such a huge corperation, that the guy's name,,, who (grin) sits
at the end of the kitchen table opening the mail,, isn't
applicable.  Baloney!
  So perhaps I lean too far the other way.  What the hey,, we're
just a lil' ol' group of guys and gals who for several years now,
are among, if not "the": largest in CoCo reachouts in America and
Canada.

I can put it onto CI$.  How can they return it to you?  Do you want to
provide a snailmail address?  I wonder, would CI$ squawk at having
your Delphi internet address on it, or do you prefer not to get it in

         No, that won't bother them. If they have internet access, they
       are gonna get used to seeing a million other internet addresses.
       Even if they did(and they won't), they still need some activity in
       the OS-9 sig anyway. I guess it's been rather quiet there the last
       couple years(hope the price reduction brings more OS-9 and Coco

 I'm really having a problem connecting to delphi @ 2400 baud. I access thru
sprintnet on a 512k 6809 machine-avatex 2400 modem. the problem is that DELPHI
will only let me connect at 1200 baud using the @ D which as I understand
should be the connect for 2400 baud. However, the HS light on the modem is not
lit. I know the modem is allright, at least everything works as it should when
I go online under decb. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks. WILLIAMSON68

 I used to use that modem when I was CoCoing so I know it can be done. Do
 you have your descriptor (/t2) set to 2400 baud? I am assuming you are
 using a hardware serial card (like the Tandy serial pak), right?

 I'm running supercomm v 2.2 which should configure the rs232 @ whatever baud
I set the emulator for (I think?). At least the modem still shows a hs
indicator when I receive the sprintnet signal. It simply refuses to connect.
The curious
thing is that when I sign on, I have to use the 2400 baud sign on @ &UPCASE D
when I make connect @ 1200 baud. Any ideas??

 That sounds weird to me, unless your calling a sprintnet node that only
 supports 1200 baud, but I figure they dont exist anymore, right?

back.

I need to know a few things.

1) Do we still have any Vendors in the CoCo Community ( esp OS9 ) ?

2) What good mags are still printing ( stopped reading after Rainbow faded) ?

OK.  We'll do what we can, and I'm sure others will fill in stuff I forget.

You bet.  CoNect, Northern Xposure, Chris Dekker, FARNA Systems come
immediately to mind; if I had a magazine in hand I'd have a longer list,
which leads up to...

Frank Swygert's *The World of 68 Micros* is still around; it goes almost
without saying that you should give serious thought to joining appropriate

it finally hit me that this was the cause of the problem I had with the
screen print program I wrote. The problem I ran into was that sometimes the
program would print all the screen and sometimes it would only print one half
of the screen. I tried every syscall in cgfx.l but I could not find out any
information that would tell why sometimes I would get full screen printouts,
and sometimes only half screen printouts.
   I realize now that the problem was that some of the screens were scaled
and some were not.

   I really hate to keep throwing these things at you, but I don't know who
else to ask, so here I go again....

   What can I do to determine whether a screen is scaled or not ?


   p.s.  I still have not had any luck in decoding that file you sent, so
           I can't tell if it corrects the problem or not.

I'm not sure about a syscall to tell whether scaling is on or not, but you
can use ScaleSW() (in Mike Sweet's cgfx lib).  You might try looking through
the Window section of the Level 2 manuals.

 Chris
      Yes I know about the ScaleSw() function, what I need is a way to tell
   if a particular window has scaling on or off. For an example I can start
   up and display a picture using Gifshow. Gifshow opens up a window using
   /w6, I then run the screen print program on /w6, and it works just fine.
   I then run my Makpal program, it opens up a window on /w7, I then run the
   screen print program on /w7, but only half of the screen(horizontally) is
   printed out. Using all the available calls,(_gs_winfo, _gs_scsz, _gs_styp
   and so on), I get reports of identical screen sizes for both /w6 & /w7,
   both say that they are 320 pixels wide. Just lately I found out that
   scaling is turned on by default, and if you don't want it you must shut it
   off, well in the Makpal program I didn't shut off scaling, so even though
   it reports itself as a 320 pixel wide screen it is acutally 640 pixels
   wide. While apparently Gifshow turns scaling off, so its 320 wide screen
   is actually 320 pixels wide.
       Now my dumb screen print program gets the window info and is told
   that /w7 is 320 pixels wide, so it only gets 320 pixels horizontally,
   ignoring the second half of the screen.
       As a klugg fix I added an option on the command line so when you print
   out a screen but only get half of it then try again with the -f option
   enabled, which will double the pixel count and print out the entire screen,
   but it would be a whole lot better if the program could find out whether
   the screen is using scaling or not and adjust itself accordingly.
       Please excuse the length of this reply, I tend to ramble.

Larry, this is going to be hairy for awhile - but if we don't want a lot of
broken programs out there, we'd better try something like turning scaling
off at the start of all programs, in order to keep track of what it is.
Darn it!  Hopefully we can get such a status call in RSN.

There is not to my limited knowledge, a call that returns the status of
aleing switch byte. To be safe, just command it in the mode you want
it in with the appropriate esc codes, or as suggested, use Mikes cgfx.l to
make the command call. That is not to say that an enterprising programmer,
with enough info in hand, couldn't write a util to do that, rather along
the lines of xmode I would imagine. Its a system call that really does
need adding to the screen driver, probably grfdrv as I believe thats
where the scaling takes place. Check with Alan Dekok, Colin McKay etc
about it if you're using nitros9, otherwise there may be enough clues in
Kevins Inside Os9 L 2 to make it work.
Cheers Larry, Gene

       I don't know if there would be alot of broken programs out there, as
   far as I know, I'm the only one that has run into this problem <g>.
       In regards to a status call, you probably don't need to go that far,
   there 10 reserved shorts in _gs_winfo, couldn't one of them be w_scal,
   with 0 = scaleing off, 1= scaleing on. I know that the scaleing status
   is being kept someplace in Kwindows, it just needs to be a little more
   available. <g>
       If I had to choose though, an interruptable ss_play tops my list, say
   you have some sound or music playing at the opening screen of a program
   with a click button or press key to start the program displayed, the user
   is going to expect the program to start when the button or key is pressed
   and not have to wait till the music ends. This is just one example, I can
   think of more examples where you might want to stop ss_play, but you get
   the idea. <g> In the SCC68070 manual, in the DMA section, it talks of a
   software abort flag, which sounds like what is needed, but I don't know
   if there would be problems with doing the same thing with the 68340.

  Worth mention in passing....
       Information taken from the Des Moines Register.
       (Des Moines, IA)

  John Atanasoff constructed his first working computer in the
basement of the Physics building of what is now Iowa State
University.  IN THE LATE 1930's.  Though it wasn't until 1973 after
patent infringement suits, that a federal court ruled his research;
"was the source for the ideas of modern computers".  Scientists have
called him the "Thomas Edison of the electronc digitial
computer".

  John A Atanasoff at his home in New Market MD, died of a stroke June
15, 1995.  He was 91 years old.

  Sendors comentary:
  I had never heard his name before.   It seems so odd I'd never heard
his name before.  Odd,,, because we all on our CoCo's, our Amiga's,
the PC, MAC, & compatibles, owe a debt of grattitude to this fellow.
So many times we feel as though, just one person can not possible make
a difference.    John Atanasoff certainly did that.

Hi David,

     Your welcome to collect messages. I don't know that there are any
specific techniques I can describe. Maybe you could be more specific. The
ICR is very similar to the conference utility on Delphi. Your best bet is
to come up with a unique name for the channe. (DODMA come to mind!) publish
the channel name for all those who want to join. If privacy is an issue or
you wish to keep the rest of the world from poping in to ask what on earth
DODMA is, you can set up a channel that only people invited in can get to.
I'll leave it at that until you come up with some specific questions. I hope
I can help you out.

     OS-9000 help
     From: JOHNREED     To: ALL


OK, OS-9000 users.  New Guy here.  A few questions.

OS-9000 us up and running on my "486DX4/100", and I am slowly getting
it to obey.  I have some OS-9 experience, COCO I,II,III and
OS-9/68000 on my MM/1a, so I am not completely lost, but there
are a couple little things I still can't get to work.

1. Comm ports.  I can use T1 and T2.  Even had STERM talking
to CIS when I had the (internal) modem on T2 (COM2).  Then I moved the
modem to T4 (COM4).  T2 is now a simple serial port.  T2 still
works, I can plug it into an external modem or null-modem to the
MM/1, but I cannot get OS-9000 to talk to T4.  Messydos & Windoze
and even OS/2 can find that modem, but OS-9000 cannot.  COM2 and
COM4 are BOTH using IRQ3, but I am not trying to use them at the
same time.

2. Printer.  I am using LPT1.  The address of the port seems right
accord to the BIOS and the information with the OS-9000 system.
It even makes the lights blink and puts the Deskjet through its
INIT routine when I load and init p.lpt1.  When I try to print
something, the lights blink on the printer and the system hangs.
LPT1 works fine with the other operating systems, of course.
Current method of printing from OS-9000 is to pass it via null
modem to the MM/1.

3. Disk formats.  No big deal here, but I sure can't get the MM/1
and the OS-9000 system to agree on what a "universal disk" is.  I
CAN get them both to read and write on a High density messydos
disk, so I use that for transfers.

4. Graphics.  Anything available to get OS-9000 to speak to the
Trident 94xx VGA card in this beast?  I need a CGFX_VGA.L  lib
(grin).

Suggestions welcome.

 John,

 Congratulations on getting OS9000 up and running.  Which version are you
 running?  Using the release sold at the CocoFest in Chicago a few years ago
 *may* account for some of your problems.  As I recollect, there were many
 bugs in it.  The latest version is 1.3. - much smoother.  I think its worth
 spending $200 per year for the support contract.  In addition to hotline
 support, you should be able to get the latest version of OS9000 as part of
 the package.  The people at MW say version 2.0 should be released in the
 next couple of months.

 If MSDOS, etc. can find and speak to the modem correctly, its safe to say you
 have the card configured correctly.  Check the data for the descriptor to
 be sure it matches your modem configuration.  This information is stored
 in '/dd/PORTS/PCAT/systype.h'.  Use '/dd/PORTS/PCAT/mk.scfdesc' to make a
 new descriptor.  BTW, I use an internal modem on t3 - no problems.

 Don't have any suggestions for this one.  I've had no problems.  Currently,
 I'm using either an old OKI 192 or a HP 4+.  Both work fine.  You might
 try calling MW's hotline.

 OS-9/68000 and OS9000 'universal formats' are not the same.  If I remember
 correctly, the main difference is where the FAT is placed.  Using 'os9copy'
 or 'os9dsave' located in the '/dd/CMDS/UNSUPPORTED' directory, you should
 be able to read OS-9/68000 universal format disks.  Otherwise, you're doing
 what most of us are doing - transferring via MSDOS disks or via the serial
 port.

 Well, I have G-WINDOWS for OS9000.  Have 2 drivers that should work with your
 card'.  These are generic drivers giving a resolution of 640x480x16.  I have
 additional drivers for specific cards (the Trident isn't included) providing
 resolutions up to 1200x1024x256.  With the  optional Developer's Pak, you
 have what you need to write software for gfx using G-WINDOWS.  Alternatively,
 you can purchase RAVE.  I don't think there is a driver for the Trident cards,
 but a skeleton driver is included you can fill in to make your own driver.

     Special Announcement:Late Night addition
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL


         Well, yes there is another change in the schedule, but I think
       ya'll will like this. July 31st was originally scheduled as an
       _Open Forum_  but I just got email recently confirming a
       conference I've been trying to get for some time.

         Monday July 31, 1995 at 10:00 pm Est      D.A.V.I.D W/ David
                                                                Kimble

         D.A.V.I.D,  Microware's latest OS-9 based project which has been
       getting a lot of press as of late, is the software environment
       produced for the television decoders, otherwise known as set-top
       boxes. D.A.V.I.D will be at the the heart of interactive
       television technology that will be at our fingertips in the not so
       distant futuure. David Kimble is an employee of Microware who is
       very active with the DAVID Project. He will be on hand to answer
       any questions about this product, which will be usefull for a WIDE
       range of applications, right through the TV set.

         My knowledge about D.A.V.I.D is limited which is why I'm glad
       David Kimble(appropriately named :-) ) was kind enough to guest
       host this conference. I can tell you there has been a good amount
       of attention paid to it by the press as companies jump on the
       Microware bandwagon in it's support.

         There are others here who can do a better job of explaining it,
       but on April 31st have your questions ready for David Kimble as he
       gives us a little insight on what has to be the brightest spot in
       the future of OS-9. Can any of you think of a good summary of
       D.A.V.I.D to introduce it to users here in forum?

     Conect
     From: REVWCP       To: ALL

Dear Friends:

I am posting this message for those who have been asking about
Rick Ulland and Conect.  He has not been on Delphi or on line
for awhile and I thought that I would take the opportunity to
offer an explanation.  Due to a series of events beyond his
control, Rick had to move a few months back.  He moved into a
nice old duplex on the west side of Milwaukee.

Now comes the problems.  Rick had to temporarily suspend his
Delphi account. No problem, since I was letting him use mine
in the interim.

Second problem, the telephone lines to his flat were in ghastly
condition, hanging on by a thread to say the least.  They
crashed.  A major rewiring job is needed and the phone company
is still arguing over who should pay what.  Having faced a bill
of over $300.00 to get phone service for Saint Joseph's several
years ago, I know how hard it is to get the money together.

For the time being, please send any messages that you have for
Rick to me and I will relay them.  I see Rick every friday evening
and so I can probably get to him quicker than USMail.  I want to
repeat that he is still in business.  I am using one of his
FAST-232 paks, (and it is is fast).

     Dallas Semiconductor 1284 chip?
     From: MARTYGOODMAN To: ALL

Does anyone here have a catalog that has info on Dallas Semiconductor
clock chips?   I'd like data on a Dallas Semiconductor DS1284 chip.
This is a 28 pin chip that is hooked to a 32KHz watch crystal
(pins 2 and 3) and to a source of uninterruptable power on pin 28,
with all 8 data lines, ground, chip enable, and r/w wired in parallel
with a 32 pin static RAM chip in the same circuit.

 I'd like tech specs on this chip, including both hardware and software
info on how to wire the thing in and how to acess it.

   Thanks for any help you can give me.

Hugo,

   Actually, funny you should ask... I just finished writing one a few
days ago and it's in beta testing.  I'll email you  the beta version.
What's even more strange is Ken Scales thought how nice it would be to

group?   I mean it's a (grin) bit of hike getting to a meet right?
   Not really.  "The meet" comes to your frount door.  Monthly in
the winter months,, bi-monthly during the summer.   That "The
UPGRADE Disk Magazine produced by "Mid Iowa & Country CoCo", will
come filled (the last four issues were double sided) with articles
from our members all over the US and Canada.   I have to mention
Canada, because that's where our lead OS-9 writer lives.  Chris
Dekker of C DEKKER Software, graces our magazine with his "OS-9 in
??? Many Easy Steps", series.  Plus other Chris Dekker articles
"exclusive to our magazine".
  Which brings up another subject...  Recently an OSKer was making
the usual remark,, "of course your RSDOS, and my interest is
strictly in O9".  I say usual, because there are a few OS-9 vendors
who cannot overcome their habit of stereo-typing.  Or they think I'm
as narrow minded as they?  I donno,, I've given up.  But it boils
down to this; I personally don't use OS-9.  Consequently you won't
see me in a how to get this or that module, conversation on the
net.   What the heck I don't know how to fix a disk controller
either,,,  That's why I asked Marty Goodman to write that article
and others.
  If your using RSDOS, we have articles on it.  If you want hardware
information, we have articles on that.  If you want CoCo OS-9
support,, The UPGRADE Disk Magazine, I believe offers the "BEST OS-9
support for the CoCo in the Color Community today"!!  Earlier
articles include James Jones & Boisey, as well we offer OS-9 by a
variety of authors.  But we don't stop there.  We have along with
our MI&CC library (available to England, Australia, or anywhere in
between):
  A Well organized CoCo 3, Applications, HAM, Christin Software, AND
OS-9 Disk library.  No hodge podging,, each diskette catagorized.
Rather then 1000 + disks, again you're not getting a hodgepodge of
so-so software.  We select only the best.  (please don't ask me to
list 'em here. They are on each UPGRADE disk)
  BUT WE DON'T STOP THERE!  Where can you find the really hard to
find hardware?  Seen any DS-69's, Rathscans, or MAXSOUND digitizers
here lately?  How about a Burk'n Burke HD set up ready to go?  A
Disto MEG RAM  drive?  Eleminator, Disto controller, 3-in-1
boards?   You name it. Most of this was in last months "For Sale"
column along with the usual CC3's drives and other CoCo equipment.
All of it has been there, and most likely will be back.   Or list
your stuff for sale.  No fee it's just a part of being a
member/subscriber.
  You get the disk, answer a couple of system config inputs,, and on
it opens with a new graphic each month.   Followed by a newsmagazine
contents style, graphic page listing articles.  You can read 'em to
screen or dump to printer as you wish.   Other graphics are included
with some articles.  Ya just can't (smile) get animation to work
with a hard copy.
  Now for the hard part: The price?  I would think sixty bucks a
year (the price of one RSODS only disk) would be fair.  But the
thing is we are a "not for profit group".   So how about half that?
 That would be a good deal but it doesn't even cost that much.  Can
you believe it??
         Just put $16.00 ($21 Canada/ $31 forign air)
  in the mail and you'll have a full years membership/subscription.
Appx 10 disks (15 if you count sides full) per year will come to
your door.  Chalked full of the information and services you want
for your CoCo.

     OSK C Bug
     From: WRHAMBLEN    To: ALL

The Microware C compiler release 3.2 running under OS-9/68000 release 2.4
apparently has a problem with the ? operator and string constants.  A
line of code such as:

    s = flag ? "string1" : "string2"

sometimes generates code with the wrong value for the pointer to a
string constant.  This caused me a bit of head-scratching.  The work
around is to avoid this construct or to use GCC.
