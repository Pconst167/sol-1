Hi, Russ.

Will keep my eyes open for it. Will you be using UPS or Canada Post?

David,
    I have set up the MM1_TECH echo to be sent to you with this msg.
Let me know if you get it and it gets tossed to your MM1_TECH echo.

  I sent the parcel Canada Post, registered. Ooops, that reminds me...I hope
there isn't a fee at your end for receiving it.
  Oh yeah, I just realized now that I didn't enclose any money for you to send
it back! Hmm. How about I send you a money order to cover sending it back
insured?
 
 Just tell me what would be the best arrangement for you and I'll get the
payment to you.
 thanks,
   -Russ

 I was just browsing through the messages here remembering way back when (oh,
I'd say early 80's) when I used to own a CoCo3 and ran OS/9 ... Was a nice
little system to it's time. I'm interested to see how much it's developed
since I've left (I now run a full blown UNIX (FreeBSD) system much to my
delight). As I recall, OS/9 was similiar to UNIX itself, but I'm a little
hazy. It's nice to see that old things don't die off, they just fight harder
to stay alive :) (Brings back some nice memories of my first computer -- a
CoCo2)

Chris,
     I have been running OS/9 since 1983 in all its forms on a CoCo1 and
then CoCo III.  I ran RiBBS on my CoCo III as a full Fido system since
1988.  I now run RiBBS_MM1 beta on my MM/1 with OS9-68K.
     For more info on where OS9 Lev2 has gone try the cocolist on
indy.net, dont recall the full address.  There is also a OS9list but
that address is not handy for me now.
     You can also call my BBS and get more info on the MM/1, MM/1a and
MM/1b.  The number is included in my origin below.
     There is also the internet newsgroup, comp.os.os9 and comp.sys.68k
that are very active.  I also run UUCP on my MM/1 and you can E-Mail me
at 'warren@ocnbeach.jd.com'

I found why windio56 didn't want to work when I called osterm or kterm
on /t0.
I had my buffers, in/out, set at stock 512/256.  I moded to 4096/2048
and viola no more missed chars.
My boot for windio54 had them set to higher buffers and that made the
differance.

Hi, Russ.

Took a look at things, and the only problem I was able to find was detailed in
çthe readme.1st file:

     In addition, the 16L8 sound PAL (U13) near the two sound
     chips  needs to  be fast  (a D suffix part)  or  various
     strange symptoms may occur,  including  crashes and even
     hard disk corruption.   Fast PALS will be available from
     BlackHawk Enterprises.

I checked under the label of your U13 chip. The model number of your chip is
çPAL16L8N'C', but it should be a PAL16L8N'D' model. The symptoms your system
is çexperiencing may well be an extreme example of those mentioned above.

That's really the only problem I found. Software modules look OK, as does the
çrest of the hardware. I haven't been able to get the system to boot at all
çwith the bootdisk that you provided, or with a couple of 'stripped down'
çversions.

Next step I guess is for you to ask Kevin Pease or Carl Kreider for a new U13.

TTYL. Colin.

     I just received the MM/1b our local OS9 usergroup ordered.
Must be one of the first shipped since the disks were formatted
on 95/08/13.  The date UPS dropped off here was 95/08/18.
 
     Since our usergroup is in the middle of the Southern
California Computer show we will be unable to put it together
until early next week so please don't ask about how it is
working.  Soon as we get it up and running then I will be able
to give more details.
