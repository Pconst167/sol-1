I think his best responce would be to get 2.4 to those who were promised it. As
he is not on Delphi he would likely not respond to you on the forum. I did

I'd say the's the one.. This Mike stands about 5' 8" tall..  Somewhat plump.
He has a dark beard, curly-headed.

     MM/1 Screen Saver Idea
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

I've been thinking about the problems associated with getting screen
savers to work on the MM/1.  One problem I see is finding out reliably if
the mouse and/or keyboard has been touched.

Normally, a screen saver program waits for some predetermined length of
time before it kicks in.  I envision a user state process which sleeps
for 'n' seconds.  When the process awakes, it invokes a screen saver and
goes back to sleep.  Some "master" process would monitor the keyboard and
mouse to see if either has generated an interrupt.  If so, it sends a signal
to the user state process.  If the user state process is sleeping and hasn't
activated its screen saver, it starts sleeping for the total time 'n'.  If
it receives a signal while the screen saver routine is active, it shuts that
off, restores the window and goes back to sleep for 'n' seconds.

The problem is:  there's no easy way to tell if the mouse has been moved,
save doing a constant _gs_mous() which wastes unecessary amounts of CPU time.
The keyboard is also a challenge, since some keys (like SysRq and Scroll Lock)
do not return a character to the application.

I think I've found a way to do this on the MM/1 fairly easily.

Both the keyboard and mouse are interrupt driven devices.  If you do an
'irqs' command on the MM/1, you should see something like this:

IMS MM/1 68340 11MB System  OS-9/68K V3.0  (max devs: 32, max irqs: 32)

 vector prior port addr data addr  irq svc    driver   device
------- ----- --------- --------- ---------  --------- ------
 26 (2)    1  $009fffe1 $007f9d84 $0001d0be  windio    w2 (?)
 28 (4)    1  $00e00281 $007c7a20 $00012818  sc68681   t3
 28 (4)    2  $00e00000 $007f7170 $00026ce0  scsi_mm1a
 28 (4)    5  $00e00381 $007f9d30 $000146d6  msdrv
 29 (5)    3  $009ffc00 $00000000 $000104ba  tk68901
 29 (5)    5  $009ffc41 $007f9d84 $00013ab2  keydrv
 29 (5)    9  $009ffcc1 $007da4e0 $000250b2  rb37c65   d0
100        2  $fffff780 $007f9d84 $00014a2e  snddrv
101        2  $fffff7a0 $007f7170 $00026cea  scsi_mm1a
101        2  $fffff7a0 $007da4e0 $00025146  rb37c65   d0

This may differ on a 68070 based MM/1 (could someone with an 070
please send me their 'irqs' output?)  By installing an interrupt
service routine on vectors 28 and 29, we can "borrow" interrupts from
our neighboring devices down the chain.

Look at vector #28.  Currently, three devices are using that vector
for interrupts.  Each device has an associated priority which determines
its position in the interrupt polling chain.

    ____________        ____________        ____________
   |     1      |      |      2     |      |     5      |
   |            |______|            |______|            |
   |  sc68681   |      | scsi_mm1a  |      |   msdrv    |
   |            |      |            |      |            |
    ------------        ------------        ------------

When an interrupt comes into a vector, the interrupt service routine
(ISR) for that driver determines if the interrupt belongs to that device
by checking its hardware.  If the interrupt does belong to that device,
it is serviced, and the ISR returns with the carry flag clear.  If
however, the interrupt does not belong to that device, then the ISR
returns with the carry flag set, and the kernel calls the ISR of the
next device down the chain.

So if an interrupt came in that belonged to 'msdrv', the ISR of sc68681
would be called first.  Since the interrupt belongs to msdrv, sc68681 would
return with the carry flag set.  The kernel would then call scsi_mm1a and
the same thing would occur.  When the kernel calls msdrv, the ISR sees that
the interrupt is for the mouse, services it, and returns to the kernel
indicating the interrupt was serviced.

We can install an ISR with a priority of 3 or 4 which will sit between
scsi_mm1a and msdrv. So when an interrupt comes in for the mouse, our
ISR gets it first.  It can then send a signal to a user state process
which handles the screen saving duties.  The user state screen saver
program can then act on the signal accordingly.  Once the ISR sends
the signal to the user state process, it "lies" by setting the
carry flag and returning to the kernel so that the interrupt can really
be serviced by msdrv.


The keyboard vector (#29) makes it somewhat more difficult on my system:

 29 (5)    3  $009ffc00 $00000000 $000104ba  tk68901
 29 (5)    5  $009ffc41 $007f9d84 $00013ab2  keydrv
 29 (5)    9  $009ffcc1 $007da4e0 $000250b2  rb37c65   d0

An ISR could be installed at priority 4, but it might catch the interrupt
of  keydrv, or it might catch the interrupt of rb37c65.  The good news is
that the priority of the keyboard driver can be changed by using moded or
dEd to modify the IRQ priority field in the /term and /w* descriptors.
The key is to make the keyboard and mouse ISRs be the last devices on
that vector by adjusting their priority, and leaving at least one position
between it and the next to last device so that our screen saver ISR can be
installed.

Thoughts?

No, I would not assume that.  The data sheets show the same
type of info for my Quantum 240Meg SCSI and it does do 256 byte
sectors (Which is a good thing since I'm still stuck with OSK 2.3).
Why not give it a try?  By the way, I have a Seagate 40 Meg SCSI
harddrive on the CoCo-3 thanks to the SC-II and the 4n1 board.  One
time when I was in the mood for experimenting, I took it out and plugged
it into the OSK machine.  OSK had no complaints!  So now, the way I
defragment the CoCo hard drive is to have the OSK machine copy the data
out, "deldir" from the root, and then dsave the files back.  It still
takes ahout an hour, but it's much better than using floppies.

There is one other problem with SCSI drives!! The Mac drives should work
fine with a CoCo, but not all PC drives will. The PC uses a parity check bit
even on the hard drive. If you can't turn this parity bit off (Seagate's
have a jumper), you can't use it on a Mac or CoCo!!

Charlie,
Forget the Conner Cp 3100 as it is for a "green PC" and requires the
appropriate drivers and/or hardware.  I have one that will not talk
to my Disto 4in1 with or without SCSISYS 256 or 512 sectors.  It is on
its way back after I got a call from JEM yesterday explaining the
situation.

It seems that it powers down after now activity to save power.  The hitch
is that the driver must send a hex code to wake it up and wait for power
up and then read or write to it.    (now = no)

Hope this saves some headaches trying to get an incompatible drive going.

Best wishes,  Keith

I know all about that stinking jumper <G>..  I worked about a week trying
to get my ST1096N working on my coco..  At that time, Seagate had a BBS.
I dloaded a file for it, It had a diagram using IBM graphics to show all
the jumpers etc, but the meaning wasn't clear when displayed on the coco,
and my printer at that time didn't support IBM graphics, so it still didn't
help me..  I finally got it working, and it was a real thrill seeing that
thing format... I was beginning to get kind worried <G>

Are you sure you don't have that reversed? I ask as:

(1) PC's do not have SCSI interfaces as standard equipment, so whether
    parity would be required would be up to the interface, and likely
    differs from one to another.

(2) AFAIK, the Mac *does* require parity. Having an Atari STe, I am aware
    of this due to the fact that some host adapters for it cannot
    handle parity, and it has been noted that drives intended for use
    on the Mac have parity enabled.

I'm not sure which would be which, but the Disto Controller, at least,
does *NOT* use it.  My Seagate came with the parity pins jumpered,
(enabled), and I had to remove it.

Most 3.5" SCSI drives have this capability, but it is either under the
control of a jumper, or by a software command sent after the initial
spin-up.

The capability pre-dates "green PC's" even, as 3.5" drives were first used

Even my old 1.6" high (half-height) Connor CP340 3.5" hard drive obeys a

I do not know if it can be jumpered to default to this mode, because I
have no info on it's jumper settings, and they are unmarked (except for
the SCSI ID jumpers on the bottom of the drive).

(NOTE: That last bit is a hint for anyone having the data on what the
jumpers on the front of a Connor CP340 do to e-mail me). <grin>

Are you using that Conner CP340 on a PC or on a CoCo?  If on a CoCo,
what interface are you using? Disto, Kenton, or other?  Also which drivers
are you using?  Maybe I can get this thing going!  Thanks for the reply.

Neither actually. I am using it on an Atari ST (with an ICD AdSCSI+ host

From what I understand from ST users that have purchased new SCSI drives,
most ship with parity enabled.

Just be glad you did not get a Quantum ELS-series drive. Those do not even
have a jumper to disable parity. That is set via software, and if your
machine cannot handle parity, you have two choices: (1) Find a machine
that can, and use it to disable parity, or (2) return the drive to Quantum
and have them do it.

I am not certain if the newer, larger Quantum drives have kept this, or
returned to a more sensible jumper arrangement for controlling parity.

If the Connor you have has the same jumper setup as my old CP340, this
might help. On the bottom of the drive are 4 jumpers, marked "E", "2", "3",
and "4". The ones labled 2-3 are the three SCSI ID jumpers. I have no idea
what "E" is, but I do recall I could not get the drive to work without it
enabled. I do know it cannot be "enable parity" as the "E" might imply, as
the old host adapter I had when I first got the drive could not handle
parity. The front of the drive has the following jumper setup:

     o o o o o   o
       o o o o   o

I have no idea what these jumpers do, except that the lonely pair to the
extreme right are for the activity LED. None of these are jumpered on my
CP340.

I hope this is of some help to you.

The two Quantum drives I have here, a LPS105S and a LT730S both have
jumpers to enable parity. They are shipped with the jumpers installed,
also strapped to id #6. I would guess one reason behind this is that it
is the most convenient place to store the jumper blocks for shipping.

That might be a good idea.  You might ought to leave SCSISYS in, though
(maybe backing off on it if all else fails).

Does it access the drive at all - that is, will it activate the light?
Ummm.. there couldn't be the possibility you have your cable on backward,
could there?

If it accesses the drive but returns an error, you might look into the
parity bit thing, if you haven't already.  My Seagate 1096N has a jumper
that enables parity checking, and it had to be removed before it would
work.

Nah, I removed the only jumper at the get go some time back. My drive works
fine with my Kenton controller. I did reverse the cable a few times but when
I start over as planned, I'll have to do that if I still don't have sucess.
I may have asked some questions regarding parity when I was trying to get a
second HD running. I gave up on that project and turned over the drive to a
friend. He's more knowledgable about these things and maybe he'll get it
working. I have three days off this week so I'll start from scratch. Thanx

I'm not surprised about the Quantum LPS105S, as it is of the same series
and generation as my LPS52S, which has an "EP" jumper.

Oddly enough, my older Conner CP340 must have a jumper installed to
disable parity, rather than enable it. (I discovered from the SCSI FAQ
that was what the "E" jumper on my CP340 was).

     cbdemo and G-Windows
     From: PAGAN        To: ALL

 Someone sent me a copy of the cbdemo file from CI$ which has a
 workable copy of cbdemo.  Naturally I tried to use it with
 G-Windows immediately.  Using it with the G-Windows libraries isn't
 as easy as it seemed it would be.

 First I tries defining my Window_Set() and auto_events() functions:

    #FCN Window_Set(8)
    #FCN auto_events(8)
    #LIB /dd/GWINDOWS/LIB/wmlib.l

 The compiler returned:
 ------------------------- snip -------------------------
 #FCN Window_Set(8)
                                                        ^
 Invalid symbol name in line 26
 #FCN auto_events(8)
                                                            ^
 Invalid symbol name in line 27
 ------------------------- snip -------------------------
 Well, OK.  The function names are longer than the 9 character
 maximum so I shouldn't've really expected this to work.



 Next I truncated the names to 9 characters:

    #FCN Window_Se(8)
    #FCN auto_even(8)
    #LIB /dd/GWINDOWS/LIB/wmlib.l

 This was better but the Window_Se() wasn't recognized when I tried
 to call it:
 ------------------------- snip -------------------------
     dummy=Window_Se(winpath,0,W_Gadget,gadgets,1,0,0,0)

 ^
 Undefined symbol in line 35
     dummy=Window_Se(winpath,0,W_Event,WEV_Close,4747,0,0,0)

 ^
 Undefined symbol in line 36
     dummy=Window_Se(winpath,0,W_Enable,1,0,0,0,0)

 ^
 Undefined symbol in line 37
 ------------------------- snip -------------------------


 OK, maybe upper case is causing it to choke.  So I trys:

    #FCN window_se(8)
    #FCN auto_even(8)
    #LIB /dd/GWINDOWS/LIB/wmlib.l

 VIOLA!  I made it to the linker before spitting me out.  I'll skip
 all he unresolved references from function found in wmlib.l because
 they could be resolved by linking in the appropiate library and
 defining the needed global variables from cstart.a.  What I'm not
 sure can be resolved easily is:
 ------------------------- snip -------------------------
 Symbol 'window_se' unresolved.
    Referenced 3 times by psect 'gtest' in file 'RELS/gtest.r'
 Symbol 'auto_even' unresolved.
    Referenced by psect 'gtest' in file 'RELS/gtest.r'
 ------------------------- snip -------------------------

 Any suggestions?  Beside creating a special G-Windows library for
 CDL basic?  That would mean stepping thru every Window_Set() and
 Window_Get() etc to determine the getstat/setstt being used and I
 like C programming just fine.

Well, if one were serious about it, could you create an intermediary
file to do something like this?

    window_se: bra Window_Set
    ...etc...

This would preserve the stack, and it would return back to the original
calling function when the G-Windows function was done.

This could be assembled to be a library file perhaps.

     Looking for IMS info.

  Howdy!  I'm wondering if anyone here might have some current
information on IMS, such as if they are still around and if/how
they can be contacted.  If so, would certainly appreciate e-mailing
that to me either here (KNOT1) or to wilmoth@msen.com.
  For those wanting to know, I was one of the early people to order
an MM/1, and ordered a pretty much full system.  I recieved a
partial system at which time I payed the balance for the entire
system.  Yes, I have pretty much written it off as a loss, but every
so often I get to feeling guilty about not having gotten it and try
once again to contact them, so far with no luck.  Figured I would
give it one more good try.  Even if I had to pay for the stuff again
it'd be nice to get the machine working fully, as my CoCo3 is starting
to act a little fritzy.
  Well, thanks for your patient ear and any help provided. :-)
(Please remember to use e-mail, as I don't get to read the forum
regularly.  Thanks!)

First, thanks to those that have pointed me to David Graham.  I have
mailed him and recieved an initial contact.
  Now, as to what I ordered and what I recieved:  What I had ordered was
pretty much a full system of your basic items:  MM/1 CPU board, 3 megs
RAM, two high density floppies, I/O board, case, fan, 110 meg Quantum
hard drive, and Magnavox 1CM135 monitor.  What I had recieved (after
about a year-and-a-half waiting) was what people called the "Personal"
system:  CPU, case, fan, 1 meg shared CPU/video RAM, my two floppies
(though one was broken), and the monitor.  I never got the other 2 megs
RAM, I/O board, or hard drive.  So with just one floppy I've gotten it
running but can't do much as far as writting code for it, which is what
I had planned on.
  So it sits on the floor in my room unused while my CoCo3 fights on. :-)

At least you have a good start, although it was very unfortunate that you
did not get the rest of the stuff.  One suggestion, I would try to go for
a little larger HD, if you have to purchase new..  The prices have really
come down and  you could get probably a 500 meg for what the 110 would have
cost when you first ordered.

I think you'll really be thrilled when you get the MM/1 up to full force.  I
got into OSK about a year ago, and OSK, while almost identical in operation
in most respects, is a lot more comfortable to use.  (Guys, don't hit me..
it's true...).  The commands have a lot of additional options that can really
make life easier.

My system has G-Windows.  It looks worlds different from the coco system.  It
took me nearly six months, I guess to finally get to where I even liked the
differences between it and the CoCo windows, but now, I'm totally hooked.

Good luck on your upgrade, I'm sure you will really be tickled with it.

I think you can get a 500 meg for maybe $300 or so now (SCSI might be a
little higher, but not much).  I have a 210 meg and have about 68% free,
but haven't really done any serious scavenging yet.

I can't speak for Dave Graham, but he isn't affiliated with IMS, and I
would think it would be impossible for him to fulfill all their outstanding
obligations.  I would think that he will do all that is within his ability
to help you, though.  I really hate to hear of anyone who loses like you
did, but at least you still have a connection by which you can receive
support.

Have you been online all the time?  If not, you may be surprised at what's
available for OSK.  It's really neat.. Oh, had you been using your MM/1
much or was it too inconvenient w/o a HD?

It's not.  These days you can get a Quantum LP540 SCSI hard drive for
something like $260.

Yes I have. I've tried Tandy, PC Sig, CoCo, and of course OS9. Also left
messages on Echo Mail areas. A lot of try Epson drivers some call Radio
Shack in Texas others said Write one and the rest say good luck. No help
and none of that worked. There might be something wrong with the printer
but it does text ok. I'm going to try to get a DOS program instead of Windows.
If that is a no go I'll just have to save or wait to get a new one. My cash
flow is uncertain right now (might be in a job change or loss) :( .

ateful for all the help I have gotten.
At least we tried.

Wonder what it takes to get a node put in?  I live in a very small community,
but there are several people who have modems.  I doubt we would have enough,
but it wouldn't hurt to try, I guess.

     Communications Decency Act.
     From: CHYDE        To: ALL

I don't remember seeing anything about this Senate Bill posted here, so I'll
mention it.

The Communications Decency Act (S314) is a bill that will try to censor
telecomunication carriers - telephone companies, on-line services, BBSes,
and such.  It's aim is to make these service providers liable for indecent
messages that they have (this includes private e-mail as I understand it).
While it was inspired because of the alt.sex newsgroups and the availability
of erotica over the net.  From the information I have the bill reads something
like this:

 The penalty for any carrier that "makes, transmits or otherwise makes
 available any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or other
 communication" which is found to be indecent or harassing would be a fine
 of $100,000 or two years in prision.

Who is to decide what is indecent or harrassing is not spelled out, though
 I would suspect it would be something similar to current anti-porn laws
(very tough to enforce).  I also suspect that many carriers may start to
monitor messages (at least try) to help avoid prosecutions.  The cost to
implement the bill would be rather large I suspect (I wonder if this would
pass the Republican cost/benifit analysis <g>).  While the ACLU, various
carriers and individuals are fighting the legistlation you may want to
chat with your Senator about it.

Of course I was only joking in my post, but you are very correct, and it
is a very delicate question.

As for making sysops responsible for the content of the system, I don't
think it is best.  There should be an attempt to make sure material does
not come through that would not be appropriate for a particular audience,
I think it is unreasonable to make it mandatory for a sysop or sysadmin
screen each and every bit of material that comes through, and slip-ups
should be allowed for.

IMO, if you want to run an adult BBS, well and good, and people have the
right to use it or not.  If you're in it to make a profit, I'm sure
your audience will determine what they want to see.

I do think that certain media should be screened. For instance, while going
off on a tangent a little, I don't like to be sitting with my family or
friends watching one of the major networks, expecting to be watching a
"clean" show and suddenly be confronted by very explicit scenes depicting
sexual activity.   It can become a little embarassing at times.  However,
if you or a group want to watch a XXX show, I see no problem with being
able to flip over and watch one.

 The idea of making sysops responsible for the content of posts
seems a little like making the phone company responsible for
obscene phone calls, or the post office responsible for objectionable
mail.

 Requiring them to `make a reasonable effort' (I know, define
reasonable) seems logical.

 Don't blame the lawmakers, they are just reacting to the acts
of a few idiots, like the student at one of my state's universities
who posted a `work of fiction' (kind of a gory one I hear) with
a fellow student's real name in it.

 Mr. & Mrs Middle America just bought junior a new computer and
are a little worried about what he will be getting into on the
`information superhighway', so they call their congressman and
tell him to `do something'.

 We have a lot of freedom on the various computer communication systems
available, but if enough people abuse it, we WILL lose it.

To me, resonable effort would be simply seeing to it that extremely -what
shall I say - "off-color"(?) stuff does not pop up unexpectedly in places
where it is not anticipated.  And I know that once in a while,
something _will_ pass through, but it is usually easy to tell if it is
an accident.

As for my opinion, I have no objection to having anything you want on a
service, as long as it it going to people who want it.  If there is a
group of people wanting XXX graphics etc, so be it.. They should have
access, but I do think a BBS that claims to be a "family" BBS should try
to keep it clean.  But, I think that if a sysop begins placing a lot of
stuff on the BBS that the majority does not want, he'll find his user
base dwindling.. Of course, if the users had paid for a particular type
service, and were not getting it, then it might be another question.

But as far as the government monitoring the content of a service, no way!

     From: WA2EGP       To: JOHNREED

This is all very familiar to me.  A while back, on amateur radio, packet to be
exact, someone posted a 900 for individuals to call if they were against
Desert Storm.  (Should be 900 number)  Well, someone bitched to the FCC and
all the sysops of the packet stations who handled the message (automatically)
got nice little letters asking for explanation and included threats of loss of
license.  (Amateur Radio operators and stations are NOT allowed to do anything
for profit, the 900 number was making a "profit" from the exposure, so
therefore the stations and their operators were violating the FCC rules.)
Got the same results.....a fear of restriction in communication because every
sysop would have to sift through the messages and kill anything that might
possibly be in the "profit" catagory.  Needless to say, that would certainly
slow down the system.  Somehow, packet radio networks survived and the FCC has
lightened up on what is permissible.  For the most part, the amateurs did
restrict they types of messages they send (no profanity, stay away from
"discussions" of religion, sex, politics) and I guess that calmed the powers
that be.  The network is basically back to normal.  Might be some interesting
parallels worth reading up on.

I'll have to check up on what keys are supported in the new _gs_keysns.
(I have to use it in my game program as well... there was an early
standard that I implemented right away and then the specs changed so I
have to find out what the new way officially is!)  In my program, I just
check the _gs_keysns() every so often to determine if a key is pressed.
Of course, the _gs_keysns call just tells you what keys are pressed
down... it doesn't empty the keys from the keyboard buffer.  So both of
us will probably have to put a few dummy reads in our program to empty
out all those characters from the keyboard buffer.

Hi All,
       Sharing a little adventure. Must have been a year ago I bought
HAWKsoft's virtual CD player only to find that the software required
that the user have a revision A WD33c93 SCSI chip on their MM1 I/O
board. I didn't. About a month ago I sent out a call on the Amiga
hangouts on the USENET and several (about 5) people responded willing to
sell me the needed SCSI chip. (They had upgraded). Bought one and went down
to the local RCA place with it. I found a knowledgeable tech who pulled my
non-revision A SCSI chip from my I/O board and put in a socket. Got the
original chip out with no damage but the good news is the replacement
chip works too and now I can use Chris's VCDP software!

You have a couple replies already. One suggestion they made is to get some
of the editors from the database here..  I never got started using them,
have them but never started with them..

I used Ved on the coco.  It is rather easy to use, and in conjunction with
its companion text formatter vprint and a good printer, you can output
some really professional-looking text.

I've used scred that comes with the Development Pak.  It has some pretty
good features, but it has one bug that will crash if  you hit an alt-key
comination.. If you use it, I have a patch for it.

CL,

Try a few of the editors here in the Database.  They all have feechers and
faults, but there are some useful ones.  Another suggestion is VED from Bob
van der Poel.  I don't have his address in front of me now, but I will get it
for you or someone here will supply it before I do.  Email me if you need it.
Bob also wrote and sells VPrint which is a powerful text formatter.  The two
are a good word processing combo for the CoCo and OS9.

Which VED are you running, CoCo or OSK?

What Alt-K does is kill off everything from the cursor position to, but not
including, the next Carriage Return. At least in the CoCo version.  I think
it asks you if you're sure if the line wraps to the next line.

All you need to do is start typing, if in Insert mode to add more text.  If
you want to close up the line, just hit the delete-character key (Break on
the CoCo) to delete the CR.

I agree.  While it might take a little more effort to get the final product
than with some more integrated software, I feel that your capability with
it is almost unlimited - well, limited probably more by your printer than
anything else.  I think they have even got a few config files out that
support lazer printers.  I've not tried to do much fancy printing, but
on one occasion I did a little project and was really impressed by the
way it turned out.

Your next move would be to get WPShel from COLORSYSTEMS here and then TSSpell
from Tandy.  Add Vu from the database here and you would have a full-blown

     StG BBS... trying to get to work

I've got the BBS almost up and running.  You can connect, go through a
new user validation, etc, no problem.  But any attempt to actually
log on causes the Coco to crash.  Popping up a login from the BBS
crashes.  Logging in over the modem crashes.  It echos the password
as stars, no problem... you hit RETURN at the end of the password...
and it goes kablooie.

Whaddyathink?

Rick, are you running the "demo" version, or do you have a Registered
system name, and net password? If you tried changeing the system name,
and did not enter the proper net password.. it WILL cause a crash. It is
also possible that perhaps you got the wrong net password for you system
name if you are a registered user... Note that you System name MUST be
tryped exactly as it was when you applied for you net password (ie, case
sensative) If you are just running as a unregistered system, it could
be that you got a bad copy of the CIA module... I might have a good
copy of the generic CIA module around here if you need a replacement.

I'm running the version that's here in the group STG NETWORK BBS V3.0.
The description of that version says that registration is necessary
for network connectivity.  But that version also won't let you run the
BBS unless you enter a system name.  I entered a system name but hit
RETURN for the net password... is that a problem?  If so, perhaps the
unregistered use of that version is more "crippled" than I realized...
you can't run it unregistered at all?  Or am I off here?  I don't mind
registering it, but it'd be nice to get it to run first.  Do I need
to switch to the "demo" version?  Obviously, I'm a little confused.
Perhaps greatly confused.  :)

I'll give the docs another run-through.  Thanks for your help.

You cannot change/set the system name without having a net password...
It SHOULD run fine withough haveing the system name set from the
"logins" program, just no network capability. Try extracting
the CIA data module from the archive, and replaceing the modified
copy with the fresh one from the archive...

I tried a fresh CIA module, and when I use bbsboot to boot up the BBS,
it immediately fires up logins, cause it thinks the BBS is not set up,
cause there's no system name.  If you quit out of logins at that point,
it goes right back to logins for the same reason.  Hmmm.

Hmm... It has been a LONG time since I ran StG on a CoCo... And I
don't have a functional CoCo here right now to do experimenting on...
The system name in CIS should be _UNKNOWN for a non registered
sytem... and more then likely the serial number is correct that you listed.
(Still haven't dug up my old CoCo StG archives) I'm thinking maybe something
else hasn't been done that is necessary... Have you run through the rest
of the logins options... especially the port and dir setup options...
I'll try logging into Carl's CoCo tonight, and see if I can figure anything
out (assumeing his system is running) and report back if I find
something ASAP...

Yep, ran through the port and dir setup options in logins.  For some
reason it won't boot the BBS cause it thinks that the system is not setup.
And if you enter the system name, it DOES think it's set up, but then it
crashes when you log a user into the BBS.  If you enter an incorrect
password, it tells you so and gives you another login prompt.  But once
a correct password is entered, kaboom.  Pretty little sparklies and a
locked-up system.

   Delphi has/had hardware problems today.  Tell SERVICE about this.
If you really want to get at this mail.mai file, you could `copy'

   Don't touch that mail.mai file otherwise, cause SERVICE can fix it.

I assumme you're talking about a Basic program?

Did you chx to that disk or call it using a complete pathlist?  There is
a bug in the shell, or something, which does not allow this, if memory
serves. If you have a packed program in, say /d1/cmds, you can't type
the command "/d1/cmds/program" and get it to run.. runb (or shell?) looks
for a module with the name of the full pathlist (or so I think), and it
just will not work.  You can chx to that directory, or you could do
something like this:

            (chx /d1/cmds;program)

Of course that will give  you an extra shell in procs, but it will work,
and upon completion, you will be returned to the original commands directory.

Hope this helps.

 Let me add one little point to the other replies -- because this
used to confuse me.

 Lets say you have your commands dir set to `/d0/cmds'  and everything
is working fine.

 Now you put a different disk in `/d0'.  This disk also has a directory
`/d0/cmds'  BUT  unless it is an exact copy of the original disk -- that
is one made with `backup' or something similar -- your commands dir
setting is no longer valid.  You still have to `chx /d0/cmds' so your
system can find `/d0/cmds' on the new disk.

 I cussed my poor old COCO several times before I caught on to that.
