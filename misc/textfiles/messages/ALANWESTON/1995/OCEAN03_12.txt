  Thanks very much Colin! I am very relieved to hear it's in his hands. I hope
it doesn't give him much trouble..
 
  I'm very eager to get it back, as I want to get going on my projects
again..(not that I have much time to spare anyways)
 
  thanks again,
  -Russ
 
  (Oh, by the way -- how does one get ahold of the newest Windio? Is it
available on Ocean Beach, or is it an upgrade I should order from Mr. Graham?)

Hi, Russ.

You should be able to find the WindIO54/KeyDrv48 combo sitting on
Warren's board. Dvorak v1.1 should also be on there. Allows you to
set up your keyboard as either Dvorak or Standard, and it fills in
some missing codes. ($1E Ctl-^ and $1F Ctl-_)

TTYL. Colin.

Hi, Warren.

Yup, all the NitrOS-9 packages will be in the mail this week. Finally.
(Thank <insert appropriate deity>.) That is one HUGE project.

Yeah, I'm interested in the RiBBS stuff, but I'm going to have to back
out of my Beta offer, at least for now. Too much other stuff on the
burner. All stuff that should premiere at the Chicago Fest. Mostly
OSK in general, or OSK specific. And UG stuff as well.

(Note to Paul Myles: Smash:OSK will be releasable when WindIO 55 comes
out. There is a bug in previous versions of WindIO that is stopping
it and other programs from being released.)

TTYL. Colin.

Colin,
    I am embarasses to say this, but I lost the Dvorak v1.1 you sent.
I had saved the msg. with uuencoded file in my /r0 dir. and was going to 
go back and uud it and then copy to floppy to xfer to the coco bbs. Well 
somewhere along the line I forgot about it and lost it when I rebooted
for some reason or other.  Sooooo, can your resend it ? pretty please !
Warren.

RE the RiBB_OSK beta.  No problem we have a pretty good lineup of
talented programmers/beta testers now.

Subject : Archiving standard
Date    : 95/02/23  23:39:00

Hello All!

I currently am holding the OCN library disks and will be updating them soon.
Before it begins I thought it would be nice if these were all archived in one
format instead of the many used now (ar1.3, ar1.5, pak, arc, etc..) So I
proposed that we (me I guess) rearchive the entire library. The format I
suggested was lha since it is portable across most platforms. Of course a
requirment would be to keep all the internal files intact including paths.
Also, while the long name used by OS9 are great, it might be a good idea to
reduce filename to 8x3 to conform with the rest of the world. This would only
affect the OCN library in circulation, files currently on individual bbs's and
may be delt with as that sysop feels appropriate. Also, with this proposal
would be to have all files, sent to and/or distributed by, the ocn be archived
in the agreed upon format. We've discussed for a while via the OS9-Net echo
and thought it was important that the whole community make the choice. Think
it over and send me a message. Please send your response directly to me and do
not argue or reply to threads on the subject. Thanks!

Bye, Tim!
