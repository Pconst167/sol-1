Our development team has considerable experience in providing set-top
application authoring and delivery tools, and we were instrumental in
developing the Stargazer application software for Bell Atlantic that is now
deployed in Italy and in the U.S.  Specifically, we have extensive experience
in developing in C on the OS-9 DAVID and CD-I platforms.

I just want to blow off some hot air after a frustrating day with Fastrak(PC)
and Ultra C V1.2:
Fastrak-PC is a bad joke to say the least (I wonder if anyone at MW ever took a
look at Borland's IDE, that's how compiling and debugging dhould be done), and
Ultra C 1.2 is even slower than 1.1 when compiling and linking (~ 200%), it
builds 25% bigger and 15% to 20% slower code than 1.1.
I'm sorry I wasted my company's money by buying Fastrak, I'll try the GNU C++
compiler now.

Christian,

I haven't tried FasTrak myself yet, but from what I've heard from others and
now from you, it is'nt worth giving it a try.

Microware are definetely not doing a good job. They're at least 10 years
behind. They still use KERMIT as their serial protocol, it's incredible. None
of they're products works 100%, you always run into weird problems. Sometimes I
feel I should give up on OS9, and try one of the other products on the market.
I'm just afraid, that I'm gonna run into similar problems!

Let me know about how the GNU compiler performs, maybe it is worth trying...

 Don't say such bad words:) Be happy that microware succeded to release an
ANSI-C-Compiler at least! Two years ago when Ultra-C still wasn't usable I got
a young guy on my side to produce some C-code. He would not believe that this
language he had to use was also called (K&R-)C.
 So, is 10 years enough?

Hi Chris,

As an employee of Microware, it certainly concerns me when a customer is not
satisfied.  I can only recommend that you address your concerns to our

I keep telling MW reps that they should just give away FastTrak... but they
could charge for support on it.

That would allow more companies to try out OS-9 and encourage its use.

If they ended up using OS-9 because of this, the license/support fees would be
far more beneficial over the long run to MW than charging for FastTrak itself.

Glad that Dr. Keil responded....I was going to do so myself, but didn't want to
be cast as a mindless-microware-supporter (or mindless anything for that
matter). The truth of the matter is that ultra-c did have some serious bugs in
the initial versions. However, I have compiled some complex programs with 1.2
and it appears to generate very good code. Certainly, things can get complex
with ultra-c, especially when converting programs from K&R-type code. Before we
flame MW too much, remember that their products are running on very distinct
platforms and it is not possible to test the code on each variant....it is
certainly much easier on a PC (mind you, Microsoft uses thousands of beta
testers...and they have to pay for the privilege). So, cool down a bit before
posting here with "this is shit" messages. It doesn't do you, Microware, or the
OS9 community any good.

Bob, I can't speak for others, but it did me good, to see that I'm not the only
one who is frustrated with MW. If they would do, what they claim to do, LISTEN
TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, their products would be much better.

They don't even bother to do something in this forum, they leave it totally up
to the users. They don't even advertise new releases, or new products. It
appears to me, they don't care about their customers.

Good point. At one point they did have their own forum...but they really never
did anything with it. I have a feeling that they may have figured that this was
just a place for people with coco's etc. to hang out and wanted to devote their
time to folks with "real" computers...or maybe they are just spread out to
thin. No idea really...and I agree with you that they should have a official
presence. On the other hand, if they are supporting with their hotline address,
at least they are doing something.

Anyway, I do know the good feeling one gets when one gets things off ones
chest.

Bob,
   Have you had a chance to use that mm2hp30 screen print driver yet ?

   I think I finally figured out what causes the problem that I had with
the program sometimes printing the full screen and then again sometimes
only printing half of the screen, even though _gs_scsz and _gs_winfo both
report the same values.
   I think the problem is in the SCALE function. Well, not the function
itself but whether the screen that is being printed has the SCALE function
turned on or turned off.
   So, I was wondering if you have any ideas on how I can get the program
to detect whether scaleing is on or off.

Hi Christian (and Jost as well!)
You are certainly very pessimistic about OS9 and UltraC...
Well as we all know MW isn't as large as fx Borland or other PC-companies and
therefore somehow don't have the same potential as in the PCworld. This is of
cause _NO_ excuse for selling "bad" software!

We are using FasTrak 1.1 (Solaris 2.3) and compared to other tools (Sun
sparcworks or also Borland/Turbo C/C++) it is quite good! Of cause the first
versions (1.0,1.1,..) all have minor (and a couple of major) bugs but is it not
the same for all software written (incl our own) ?!

Overall I find the FasTrak (Solaris 2.3 version!) a great tool!

I have no experiences with UCC v1.2 yet (I get it nxt week perhaps then I
understand your complaints..?!) but although the v1.1 doesn't produce  _high_
speed code the UCC could be much worse!

My suggestion: Report all bugs/whishes or compliments direct to microware  on
hotline@microware.com (forget "Dr Keil" if you're located in germany cause they
are _SLOW_ and really don't care). I report direct and always get a reply
within 3 days and they are mostly really helpfull (if you are writing a
_contructive_ letter !!!)

About OS9: The OS is - compared to other realtime OS - not that bad! Some packs
are better and other worse, but again MW only changes if the users report some
_contructive_ feedback.

don't worry, be happy ;-)

 True words! Any software-developer is a competitor for him, so why should he
care?

 Thats also my experience. But remembering OS-9 V 2.1 - how many weeks did I
invest to get my software running just dealing with OS-bugs. Events - a very
basic OS-service didn't work from C.
 Remembering when we bought the first release of Ultra-C with three months
update-service. A little test program - just a bit more than 'hello world' - I
couldn't get to run. This one was fixed in two updates within the three months
but there were many bugs left.
 It must be allowed to ask, if it's ok to sell a product for several hundreds
of dollars that really doesn't seem to be tested very well.

 >> The OS is - compared to other realtime OS - not that bad! <<

 That's the reason why it's still used very often. But really, there are others
being of higher quality - compared to OS-9.

I can only agree. We bought Ultra C as soon as it was available and spent a
fortune on support contracts and the recent upgrade to Fastrak, but we are
still using the V3.2 compiler for our development because of Ultra C's bugs and
performance.
I don't even want to think about the money the wasted ours cost us.

I think you are right about the Unix version of Fastrak. I also heard that it

Does anybody have experiences about the difficulties and hidden traps when
upgrading from OS-9 Version 2.4 to OS-9 Version 3.0 ? We want to upgrade - to
up-to-date - but we are afraid of bugs and much work to change our

So, please send me a short information about your experiences or a place where
I can get more infos about this stuff.

Hi Georg,

I have a lot of experience with upgrading from 2.4 to 3.0. It's not that big a
problem. Only some device drivers won't work, because MW changed the
specifiaction for device drivers. Actually, none of the device drivers we were
using (for a graphics and a serial board) would work with 3.0. Also your boot
method might not work. I was using the OS-9 MVME162 BSP, which comes with a
boot prom from MW. The boot prom for 2.4 could not boot 3.0, you have to use
the new prom.

These should be all the problems that arise with upgrading, from my experience.
If you don't use other device drivers than the ones that come with OS-9, and if
you use a boot prom from an OS-9 vendor, you shouldn't have a problem at all.
OS-9 3.0 is much more predictable in it's real time response than 2.4. So it's
worth making the step, IMO. Also, MW's new developments are for 3.0 of course,
another reason to do the upgrade, as you said, to stay up-to-date.

If you need help with the upgrade, let me know. Right know I am in the US, but
I'll move back to Germany next week (I take it from your name that's where you
are). I will try to start my own business there. So I'm available to help you
out!!!

Sorry about the FROM_MEDIA FROM_DISK problem in ln.c.  I don't remember

will correct the problem.

The reason the #define was put in was the SCSI disk drivers that came with the
TC-70 would always send back 256 as the sector size, even if it was really 512.

Where did you get the link() function?  Was it included in the ZIP sources?

It was a simple change, really.  Not really difficult to find after I got over
the laziness of getting started at looking at the source.  If that error was
yours, had you already discovered it?

Yes, there was some info in there about that.

I downloaded this with the Zip archive from Delphi, I believe.  Someone has
just uploaded a modified version with the FROM_DISK fixed, and apparently
another change or two, since their module is a different length than mine. The
link() function was with the sources.  Someone sent me a version of Zip that
didn't utilize the link() function.

In looking over the source, there is a file called "osk.c" and this stuff is in
it.  Ln is credit to Bob Larson and it is noted that you had added
sector-checking, it says Dec 8, 1992.

I don't believe I saw any name as to who was responsible for the port of Zip
itself.

This might be good for several to know.  I had never fooled with this aspect of
disk structure.  To be honest, I was not really clear on the actual function of
the link field, but I figured it out and with experimenting with ded, found out
exactly what the link count did <G>

Sb: #Dynamic Binary Fixup
Fm: Craig S. German 72752,2336
To: All

Does anyone know if it's possible to load and un-load self-contained code
dynamically in OS-9 using anything other than OS-9 modules?  What I would like
to be able to do is have a primary task that doesn't know at startup what
functions it needs, and that it loads binaries on an as needed basis.  As an
example, let's say I didn't know ahead of time that I would need to display
text.  I determine this need at run-time, request a load of a text display
executable (with an API that is known), and then begin to make text display
calls.  Is this only possible using OS-9 modules?

The reasons for avoiding modules are: 1) I'm not sure if loading a module uses
malloc, and if it does, I was told mallocs are bad in OS-9, at least in a CD-I
environment; and 2), I wanted to know if there was some less OS-9 specific
method of doing this.

Thanks,

Craig,
 Modules are part of the basic concept of OS-9. I thing it is a fine thing from
the developers sight. So I don't see any reason to avoid them.
 1.I'm really not sure if OS-9 uses malloc internally for allocating modules.
Though it is true that malloc with OS-9 has its problems, i never had problem
with modules.
 2. Even if there are standards as posix is, you will alway have some features
being specific to any operating system. So why do you want to avoid them? In
some level of abstraction it is all the same, if modules or not.

I used to do OS9 development, but it's beena while...

Malloc() is typically an application class function. I would think that when
allocating memory for executable operation that the operating system would use
a lower level call (like sbreak(), ibreak(), or f$mem).

We used loadable modules in our application without problems (os9 2.4 on 68040
VME boxes). Just watch those link counts!

Hello Craig,
there is a User Group in Europe, called European Forum for OS9 (EFFO). They
have a magazine 3 times a year. In the mag (OS9 International) there is in the
latest issue
an article about this topic: Subroutinemodules (dynamic link libraries they are
called in the Windows world nowadays).  They are designed for that purpose you
need.
Unfortuntely Microware only talk about basic09 subroutine modules.
But this is not the only language you can use this mechanism.
have a closer look at the magazine.

OK, OS-9000 users.  New Guy here.  A few questions.

OS-9000 us up and running on my "486DX4/100", and I am slowly getting it to
obey.  I have some OS-9 experience, COCO I,II,III and OS-9/68000 on my MM/1a,
so I am not completely lost, but there are a couple little things I still can't
get to work.

1. Comm ports.  I can use T1 and T2.  Even had STERM talking to CIS when I had
the (internal) modem on T2 (COM2).  Then I moved the modem to T4 (COM4).  T2 is
now a simple serial port.  T2 still works, I can plug it into an external modem
or null-modem to the MM/1, but I cannot get OS-9000 to talk to T4.  Messydos &
Windoze and even OS/2 can find that modem, but OS-9000 cannot.  COM2 and COM4
are BOTH using IRQ3, but I am not trying to use them at the same time.

2. Printer.  I am using LPT1.  The address of the port seems right accord to
the BIOS and the information with the OS-9000 system. It even makes the lights
blink and puts the Deskjet through its INIT routine when I load and init
p.lpt1.  When I try to print something, the lights blink on the printer and the
system hangs. LPT1 works fine with the other operating systems, of course.
Current method of printing from OS-9000 is to pass it via null modem to the
MM/1.

3. Disk formats.  No big deal here, but I sure can't get the MM/1 and the
OS-9000 system to agree on what a "universal disk" is.  I CAN get them both to
read and write on a High density messydos disk, so I use that for transfers.

4. Graphics.  Anything available to get OS-9000 to speak to the Trident 94xx
VGA card in this beast?  I need a CGFX_VGA.L  lib (grin).

Suggestions welcome.

 Yeah, COM2 and COM4 are both using IRQ3.  BUT -- I don't try to use them at
the same time.  In fact, with OS-9000, I only load one of the device
descriptors.  Messydos and OS/2 on the same box let me get away with that.  I
hate to start playing IRQ-Roulette on the 486 - everything you fix breaks
something else.

 John,

 Congratulations on getting OS9000 up and running.  Which version are you
 running?  Using the release sold at the CocoFest in Chicago a few years ago
 *may* account for some of your problems.  As I recollect, there were many
 bugs in it.  The latest version is 1.3. - much smoother.  I think its worth
 spending $200 per year for the support contract.  In addition to hotline
 support, you should be able to get the latest version of OS9000 as part of
 the package.  The people at MW say version 2.0 should be released in the
 next couple of months.

 If MSDOS, etc. can find and speak to the modem correctly, its safe to say you
 have the card configured correctly.  Check the data for the descriptor to
 be sure it matches your modem configuration.  This information is stored
 in '/dd/PORTS/PCAT/systype.h'.  Use '/dd/PORTS/PCAT/mk.scfdesc' to make a
 new descriptor.  BTW, I use an internal modem on t3 - no problems.

 Don't have any suggestions for this one.  I've had no problems.  Currently,
 I'm using either an old OKI 192 or a HP 4+.  Both work fine.  You might
 try calling MW's hotline.

 OS-9/68000 and OS9000 'universal formats' are not the same.  If I remember
 correctly, the main difference is where the FAT is placed.  Using 'os9copy'
 or 'os9dsave' located in the '/dd/CMDS/UNSUPPORTED' directory, you should
 be able to read OS-9/68000 universal format disks.  Otherwise, you're doing
 what most of us are doing - transferring via MSDOS disks or via the serial
 port.

 Well, I have G-WINDOWS for OS9000.  Have 2 drivers that should work with your
 card'.  These are generic drivers giving a resolution of 640x480x16.  I have
 additional drivers for specific cards (the Trident isn't included) providing
 resolutions up to 1200x1024x256.  With the  optional Developer's Pak, you
 have what you need to write software for gfx using G-WINDOWS.  Alternatively,
 you can purchase RAVE.  I don't think there is a driver for the Trident cards,
 but a skeleton driver is included you can fill in to make your own driver.

remove all serial ports from the boot, and load ONLY the one I plan to use.  To
use the other one, I must reboot (sometimes twice) and start over.  DEINIZ and
UNLINK don't seem to remove enough of one to let the other work.

 Printer - I am beginning to suspect my cables.  When I put the "accelerator"
68340 board in the MM/1, I discovered that I had to switch to short shielded
cables for the printer - something kinda marginal in the timing with the faster
system. Maybe a similar problem (486 has a ribbon cable on the printer port).

 GWINDOWS sounds attractive.  I couldn't quite convince myself to buy it when
you made the offer for an MM/1 port, but the MM/1 already has graphics, the 486
with OS-9000 does not.

I am presently in "Father of the Bride" mode - not a lot of extra bucks for a
couple months, but I should recover by Fall.

Thanks again for the help. John Wainwright

 John,

 I had forgotten some of the problems I had when I went to a 'fast' 486.
 Originially, I used 25 and 33 MHz machines and didn't have any problems
 running OS9000 attributable to hardware.  When I went to my current hardware,
 a DX-2/66, I did have many problems.  (Unfortunately, I didn't document them.)
 MW suggested I remove all caching.  I did this and things worked properly.
 Started adding caching until problems cropped up.  Turned out I couldn't
 enable 'External Cache Memory'.  BOIS is AMI.  Since you're running at 100
 MHz, you may have a similar problem.

 I have t1 and t2 in my boot file and load t3 in the startup file.  I use
 t1 for a terminal, t2 is my mouse and t3 my internal modem.  I've had no
 conflicts between t1 and t3.  I haven't tried running a modem from t1, but
 I have run the modem (t3) from a terminal on t1.  I don't remember if I had
 problems putting t3 in the boot or I just didn't get around to making a new
 boot.

 I don't remember whether earlier version of OS9000 included them but version
 1.3 includes descriptors and a driver for the DigiTech Serial card.  These
 are in the PORTS/PC8 directory.  They use the higher irqs available on
 16 bit buses.  I haven't tried them yet, but it seems they may work as
 written or with a minor modification with modem cards that permit accessing
 these irqs.

 Well, maybe.  But I think you said the printer worked properly under DOS and
 WINDOWS.  This suggests that the hardware is OK.  I'd suspect either the
 hardware's caching or the 'pcpll' driver.  I don't remember if I had problems
 with the earlier version of OS9000 but I don't with 1.3.  I go through about
 15 feet of cable and 2 printer switches (definitely not recommended).
 Several GFX programs I wrote work OK as does 'PSF'.  You mentioned (re
 serial ports) you had to remove the serial ports from the boot and load them.
 I load 'lpt2' and 'pcpll' from the startup file.  Don't remember why.
 (Sometimes I do things the 'easiest' way and don't get around to doing them
 'properly'.)

 Congratulations!  Didn't you know in this mode you are supposed to have
 bottomless pockets <g>?  E-mail me your mailing address and I'll send you
 a demo copy of G-WINDOWS.

John, I would like to put in a plug for GWINDOWS.  I got it with my system when
I bought it from Ed.  I am totally impressed.  It has features that I still
cannot believe.  Of course, with everything, I can compose a little wish list
for it, but basically, I don't think I could live without it now.

It did take me a little time to get over the jet lag from coming over from the
coco.  I liked a lot of its features.  Not being able to just jump from one
screen to another took a little getting used to, but now, everything seems
quite natural.

One small feature that I am really endeared to is its cut and copy feature. It
seems to have 1000 uses.  One thing I have done with it, although my need for
it is my fault, is that I have dialed up a BBS which uses hard-to-remember
passwords.  Rather than use file transfers or whatnot, I can just list it to a
screen, cut, and double-click on the telecom window and transmit it that way.
You can even send a small file this way.  I know this particular usage is not
necessary, as there are other ways, but I just use this to demonstrate what
_can_ be done.

When you can see your way clear, I would definitely go for it.
