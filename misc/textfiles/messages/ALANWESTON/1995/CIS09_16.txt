I sort of assumed that 'traffic' meant read/green lights... but it certainly
could have been info signs, etc. The article just wasn't all that clear. But it
did say that since CA is using OS9 that other states (systems?) would end up
using that same system...so it should be good news for MW.

Yes, you can.  However, you might be well served to just keep your /d0 as a 360
floppy.. You need one somewhere for compatibility.  You could add two 720's for
/d1 and /d2.  What I did was get a PC case for a drive case. It will hold all
your floppies and your HD, if you have one.  The only gotcha - especially if
you don't have a HD is that _some_ power supplies require a little power draw
to work... Mine works alright, so either the PS is not like this or the HD
pulls enough to make it operate..

You don't need a different driver.  All you need to do is to change your device
descriptor.. You need to change the tracks from 40 to 80, and change the TYPE
from 01 to 03 (I think)...  You change the type, anyway <G>.  That's all there
is to it.

JOB OPPORTUNITY IN SCOTLAND

I work with a medium sized heavy engineering company based in Central Scotland,
employing around 400 people. We are world leading manufacturers of coal mining
equipment to markets in the UK, USA, France, Australia, South Africa, China,
Poland, Russia etc.

I am Systems Engineering Manager with a team consisting of Electrical
Engineers, Electronic Engineers, Software Engineers and Automation Engineers. I
myself come from a background in Software Engineering. My team are responsible
for designing and implementing the control and monitoring systems on-board the
mining equipment. The Electronic Systems include bought-in motor drives, radio
control equipment, data communications equipment, and in-house designed
industrial control computers based on single height VME hardware platforms. The
embedded software on these control computers runs under OS-9.

I am looking to increase our software engineering capability to match the
massive demand for new functionality on the control computers, and to continue
the support of our existing systems in the field (We have supplied over 40 of
these control computers to cutomers in most of the aforementioned markets).

I am looking for up to 2 Software Engineers for a three month temporary
contract, with the possibility of a full-time position at the end of the
contract. I would like to hear from you if you have OS-9 or other RTOS
experience, with a background in embedded industrial systems. Recent graduates
will also be considered.

Thanks for the reply,

In the meanwhile I already found something, maybe of interest for you too: the
kernel does actual fpu-calls, and uses the fpu workspace for adressing it
(fc0-2 = 1, a19-a16 = 0010). When giving a buserror at this addres-space,
everything works fine. Just a differenc between 68000 and 68020! By the way, I
use os9 2.3, and build my own boot-rom.

Hi all,

I am finding that I get inconsistent results when passing some format commands
to fprintf in Ultra-C. For example, the following code :-

fprintf(fp,"%02d",value);

should print a two digit value, with the first digit being a zero if the value
is less than 10. In some cases this works OK, but in others I get a leading
space instead of a zero when the value is less than 10.

Anybody else seen this and know how to avoid it ?

By the way, I am compiling without the -i option.

To:  72330,2051 (X)

Sorry I took so long in getting back but its been busy around here lately. I
finally managed to get the drive to format by making sure that nothing in the
device descriptor makes the heads go past the 614th (0-614) cylinder including
the PARK track. But... now I have another problem. The drive can be formatted
ok and files copied to and from it ok, but when my system is powered off and on
you may not be able to access it again. Most times I get Seek Error #247 right
off the bat. Powering off and on up to several times seems to be the only way
to access the drive again if it works at all. And if that isn't enough, some
files may "disappear". I ran DCHECK three times and on the third check it
displayed a "fatal error" which was a Seek Error again.

I think you may have something there about the drive not being low level
formatted on track 0 while the logical format tries to start at track 0.
Although if this is the case I'm not sure why the Seagate ST157R drive gets
seek errors while the older ST124 doesn't using the same WD1004-27X controller.
Part of it may be due to the fact that the older drive can be formatted for any
number of cylinders up to about 670 which is much greater than the 615 shown in
the data sheets. There may be other things that are tolerated on this older
drive that are not tolerated on the ST157R.

I am still interested in finding an updated Vers 2.5 Burke & Burke hard disk
driver which is reported in their documentation as correctly initializing both
old and new controller cards. There is nothing in vers 2.4b software that you
can set to allow you to start the format at track 0 or 1.

Thanks for the info. No I never did get ahold of him. I am still having

Bad drive ???  The drive can still only be formatted for 614 of the 615 tracks.

Hello,

I have been trying to put the Interbank Incident (3 floppies) on a single
double sided 40 track disk. I managed to cram all the game files onto such
disk, short of the OS9 boot files and some commands not needed to play the
game. The turn came to create a new VDG bootdisk on my CoCo 3.... the system
does boot ok and do:

chd /d1
chx /d1/cmds

keeping the system disk in /d0 and the game disk in /d1. When I start the game
('bank') /d1 spins and begins loding the game but all I get on the VDG 256x192
screen is a mess of dots and the system hangs.  Booting the game with the OS9
L1 v2 provided works ok...

Does the Interbank Incident specifically needs the OS9L1 boot files?
Has someone tried this before and been successfull?

Thanks ;-)

Manfred,

as far as I know, MW offer a special BSP version for the MVME162LX. The PROM
socket on the MVME162LX is different from the one for the regular MVME162. The
special BSP also supports all four serial ports, the regular one only two.

BTW, I work as a freelance engineer in the fields of software and automation

I have been running it on MVME162LX fora year, and I don't recall any problems,
beside that you have to make the device-descriptors for the additional 2 serial
ports yourself. The only problem that might come up, is if the MVME162LX is
equipped with ECC-memory, as the standard bootprom does not know how to set
this up. I might be able to help you out with that too ??

Hey Yourself,

Yep I still work with Mike at Hazelwood. As you can see from the header we
changed the name to CDL Basic. Seems the 'other' name was taken. I 'thought'
that Ford as well as the other car companies used OS9 a lot. But maybe it's
embedded in some robot or something and 'they' don't see it. Years ago one of
my customers was constantly going over to England to do OS9 things at Ford etc.
If my fading memory serves me it did have something to do with the robots on
the line.

Nice hearing from you.

Well, you're right. OS-9 is EVERYWHERE on the lines, but here in "product
engineering-land" nobody's ever heard of it.

My job is doing project management for Electronic Engine Controllers (EECs).

It's good to hear from somebody from the past, Frank!
