Rmember that Zmodem blocks stream, and each block is a lot bigger than 1024
by the time you add headers and trailers. With that said, I must register
my vote for small rx buffer sizes. The big buffers combined with the slow
MM/1 display cause problems with screen pausing. With a steady high-speed
data stream, when you punch the pause key (BBS, Unix login, whatever) the
screen will scroll by the time the modem and driver buffers empty.

 Speaking of such, who is now mantaining the coco version of zmodem? I have
yet-another request. :>

As I said, this seems to be something of a problem for all our sytems.  I
don't need it myself, but I did hear Ed Gresick mention that some of his
users had complained about CD detect problems..

Well, from what experience I've had, I've begun to consider it to be
<almost> rock-solid. So far, I haven't had any trouble with it.  I went in
and modified my driver to have a 2048 buffer.  It came out with only 200
bytes, and when the comm program zeroed out the xon/xoff flags, there was
no automatic flow control whatsoever within the driver.  I modified it
to a 2048 buffer and added a crude RTS/CTS flow control, and now, (knock
on wood), have no transfer error whatsoever.

Seriously, I consider your rz/sz one of the most dependable term programs
available to us today..  The only "gripe" might be the fact that you always
have to add </t2 (or whatever), but the first time you log on from a remote,
and want to do a d/l or u/l from that remote, you really begin to appreciate
this "inconvenience"..

Okay, you lucky person. You get to here my request.

 It appears that *z picks the packet size based on port speed. It also
appears, when checking port speed, to strip PD.Bau to the lower three
bits. CoNect's Fast232 board, just like the MM/1, uses the lower four bits
to get higher than "standard" baud rates. It's kinda annoying having sz
pick a packet size of 128 bytes when using 57600. :> Therefore, I am
requesting a four bit strip rather than three. AND* #$0F rather than #$07.

I just looked at my latest code, and it does indeed look lik I already
"fixed" it...

Can you send me a list of your supported baud rate tables though. I think
what might be happening is it assumes you are at an unsupported baud rate,
and interpetes it as the LOWEST rate, instead of the highest...

Did you spray the WD-40 on the board?  I thought someone said that you
shouldn't use WD-40 on or around printed circuit boards, that it would
damage the board.  Is this true?   If it doesn't hurt a pc board, is it
alright to use in on a printer's rail?  I think I had sprayed the rails
at one time, but had quit after being told this..

BTW.. if WD-40 is not good for a printer, what can you use safely?

I've used WD-40 plenty times before with no harm. It DOES contain a rather
strong solvent (paint thinner),
so you might not want to use it on circuit boards all the time. A little squirt
now and again won't hurt anything though.

Frank,

To add my 2 cents here, WD-40 IS a relatively strong solvent, but, because it
also has highly evaporative qualities, its solvent action does not last long.
Hence, the danger of its ruining a circuit board is minimal.  What MUST be
considered seriously is its flammability.  Be very damn careful with soldering
irons and hot components when using WD-40 or any other flammable solvents in
your work!  Evaporative ones also carry the risk of harmful fumes in poorly
ventilated areas, so, as a second precaution, do NOT work with WD-40 or any
other solvents in small, closed areas!

OK.  Seems like someone recommended I didn't use it on my Multi-Pak and
someone else said to not use it on a printer rail. I had used it on both
before, though.

Your action would not have been my choice.  For example, because it is also
possible to douse matches in buckets of gasoline, does that mean that it is a
wise or safe thing to do?  What have we proven here?  Just because something
is possible doesn't negate the inherent danger.  Sometimes luck is with you

 Perhaps my post was a little too brief.  The line ---

  (Expanded) -- ".... Mistake" = the %&$* thing shot fire out of
every vent on the drill body and ".... Much excitement" = scared the
living daylights out of me and everyone in the immediate area.
"Said a discouraging word" = It also removed some hair from the back of
my hand, causing me to say words that are not normally in my working
vocabulary.

 The intent was to AGREE with your post, and give an example of what
could go wrong.

BTW, I don't use WD-40 for anything anymore - not because of its
flammability, its the SMELL of the stuff that I can't tolerate.

Just my two cents about WD-40, it is NOT a lubricant.  It is intended to
displace moisture and losen rust.  If you want a light lubricant try 3 in 1
oil or another light machine oil.  As for WD-40 preventing corrosion I have
my doubts, it's made to evaporate and whether the residue will harm anything
is anyone's guess.  To lubricate the printer rail use a non-aerosol lubricant,
these generally work better and don't contain anything extra (like propellent)

That's what I tried on my printer..  After the warnings, I was not sure
even about 3-in-1, but put a slight amount on it..

Actually, I've been told that WD-40 draws moisture...

The BETA has this error, and it apparently occurs only when one of
the apps is MSNetwork.

The release version will not have this specific error. It has already
been fixed in a later beta. Unfortunately, it got fixed too late to ship

What?!?  I am quite confused by this post.  I read the Mac SIG on Delphi every
day, and it has the most messages of all of the SIGS I read - usually 25 to 50
messages a day.  The OS9 SIG, on the other hand, is about 1/2 the volume of a
year ago. (sadly)  I fear that OS9ers, in pursuit of the more fully featured
apps and high resolution graphics, are increasingly doing more "mainstream"
computing.  However, most of the people who have remained steadfast OS9ers
have become generally more expert computer users.  Thus, your statement about
receiving fast, reliable answers here has the ring of truth.

Seems like things are kinda slow, but they're slow on my local BBS, too.
Probably Spring weather.

I've been going into the Mac Hardware Forum over on CI$.  It's still pretty
active, but come to think of it, maybe it's slowed down some, too.. I'd
eliminated a few topics to get the volume down, though.

 Actually, you (and I) should get SPECIAL consideration and RESPECT
for running Coherent, since (Like the COCO) it is now an orphan.
Too bad.  CoCo types seem to have a weakness for orphans - my MM/1
was an orphan for a little while, but it got adopted.

Hi Paul,
  I forgot about "spring break", that would seem to apply here.  But,
over the years, I have noticed a considerable drop in the number of
messages.  I remember sitting here for about 2 hours going through a
weeks worth of messages.  I do know that some people have given up on
the CoCo/OS-9 completely and go on to other platforms.
  I remember about 3 or so years ago, there was this teenager in this
forum on a daily basis.  Every other message here was from him.  His
name was (is) Jason.  I have not seen him out here for a very long
time now.  I do know that quite a few people also have an account on
other services such as CI$.  Maybe they have opted for just one service
and dropped their Delphi account in favor of the other.
  To finish the first paragraph above, I now sit here for 20-40 minutes
reading through these messages, unless I reply to some directed to me
such as this one.  I do not use an off-line reader to reply.  Since I
do not pay a long distance call I spend a lot of time on-line.  Just
lst week, I spent over 3 1/2 hours on the Internet alone, about 1/2
an hour here in the OS-9 Sig.
  "Surf the Net".  I have found this term to be a very widely used
one for spending time on the "Net".  Every magazine or newspaper
article I read or TV show I watch, about the "Net", uses this term.
I would venture to say that it was probably started out here in
California, knowing the general attitude out here for just being in
this state.  Oh well...  See ya among the stars...

Hi Steve,
  "Long time no see!"  Hope you are doing fine.
  What you said, in your message, is about the same opinion that
I have.  I do know of at least one person here who uses OS/2.  I
myself have opted for this OS since my opinion of Microsoft is a
very low one.  There is one thing in setting standards by which
machines use an OS or software but preventing competetors from
having ALL the secrets of an OS for their software to run and use
the OS to its fullest potential is down right BOGUS!  THIS LAST
STATEMENT IS MY OPINION AND DOES NOT REFLECT THE OPINIONS OF
OTHERS HERE OR ANYWHERE ELSE!
  Until I can afford to get OS/2, I will be using DR-DOS V6.0.
I have this right now and will not have to wait to use my 486
when I finish building it.

Hi Dave,
  Yeah, you are probably right about losing interest in the CoCo,
but, I do not plan on losing my interest in OS-9.  I do plan to
support the CoCo and OS-9 to the best of my abilities.  I have a
few unfinished projects (programs) that I do want to finish.  Be-
sides that, it is my responsibilty to support the files I have
uploaded here on Delphi.  So, I will need to stay relatively ac-
tive in OS-9 for the CoCo 3.
  Until I started "surfin' the Net", I really had no thoughts of
buying and using another machine.  I find that being on the Net
pretty much requires a mainstream platform to be efficient.

Hi Dennis,
  My plans for the machine are getting it running first with the
basics needed.  I have an EIDE card I picked up for about $60.00
new.  I have an Intel 14.4 Fax/Modem, very slightly used, $71.00.
The Moden was used at work for about 6 months.  When the boss
told me he was dropping the project, I told him I wanted the modem.
The motherboard was used and picked up from a friend.  I trust
him on this.  Oh, $10.00 I think. No CPU or memory.  I got a med-
ium tower w/300w power supply, new, $55.00.  I have a "cheap"
keyboard, new $5.00
  I can get a new 486dx2-66Mh for $166.00 and 4MB of ram for about
$148.00.  A new 540MB HD for about $150.00.  1.44 MB floppy for
about $20-30.00.  I have not looked into video real hard yet but
I should be able to get it reasonably.  CD-ROM, well that is
not a real neccessity at this point in time.  Like I said, basiic-
ally I just want to get it up and running.

Hi Allen,
  Windoze2010 will NOT take over MY machine!  I will NOT run it
or even have it installed on MY machine!
  I had Windoze V3.1 on the 486 at work, used it primarily for
the playing of games (on break of cource).  I tried to install
Windoze For Workgroups V3.11 on the machine and had nothing
but ONE BIG HEADACHE!!!  I had Novell Netware already config-
ured on the machine and Windoze would not allow it to run.  I
DO NOT LIKE THAT!!!  Needless to say,  I deleted ALL remnants
of Windoze off the machine.  Windoze will NOT be my personal
choice for an OS.  Contrary to popular belief, MS-DOS is not
DEAD and will NOT be DEAD for some time to come.  I do not
think that the industry is going to allow the extinction of
a command line based OS.

This thing right here is what is killing us.  We look around and see all
the things that _can_ be done and it's often quite tempting.. I looked
hard and long at my options.  We _do_ have a lot of stuff to work with,
but we still have a long way to go if and until we are on an equal footing
on a software basis..  When it comes down to getting really fancy, we
just don't have the bells and whistles - at least yet.. For instance,
we have two local BBS's, both support RIP graphics.  I saw it on a PC and
it is really fantastic (so is http).  But as far as I know, we don't have
RIP capability, so are left out here.

I did make my choice, I still love what I can do with my system, but, still
it would be nice to be able to do all these neat things the "mainstreamers"
can do..  I have thought about getting another system myself, just for those
little things I cannot do, but can't see the justification in keeping two
systems for that purpose.. I do feel one would be going to the one just
out of habit, if nothing else.

I don't blame you guys for going to the mainstream systems.  I guess it is
a much more practical thing to do.  Chances are that I might bail out, myself
sometime in the future, but I want to stay with the system as long as I can.

Keep an eye open...I believe that one of the things to be added to K-Term
is RIP support.  I emailed David Graham a copy of the RIP spec a while back,
and I hope that it's underway.

Is RIP public domain and OK to mimic?  I'd like to get this spec myself or
for someone who is working on a G-Windows package..

I look at PC software from time to time to get ideas for programs and
techniques on my MM/1 (LinkUp is a prime example)  All of these fancy
applications are possible to do under OS-9, but not all are feasible.

Remeber, the PC world is using 486 and Pentium processors, while we are
still using slightly outmoded 68000 and 68070 processors.  The 68340 is
probably the equivalent of a high end 286.  We should be using 68040's
if we are to keep up with the number crunching of PC'ers.

I've found profound value in getting PC software to use on my MM/1,
such as the Infocom games and various audio file packages which were
meant to run under Windows.  I find that reuse of these assets really
justify me having my MM/1.  True, binary files are totally incompatible,
but when I see something running on a PC that I would like, I begin to
see how feasible it would be to write such a program.  If it's something
I think I can do in a reasonable amount of time, I'll start the project.

If we had .BMP picture viewers, that would open up a tremendous amount of
assets in the PC world.  Right now, Mike Haaland and I are putting
finishing touches on an audio player utility that plays .wav, .iff, .au
and .voc files.  It even handles 16 bit audio files.  Applications can
actually call this program to do audio on their behalf (as the current
version of LinkUp is now doing).

I bought a book not too long ago called "Windows File Formats" which
outlines the formats for such files as .BMP, .WAV, truetype fonts,
.ICO (icons) and a whole bunch more.  I haven't had time to implement
ideas I've received from this book, but I think we'll find much more
satisfaction with our machines if we can use assets on already existing
PC systems and write the program to manipulate these assets.

Just my .02.

Well...I forget where I downloaded it, but it was sitting there for the
downloading.  Public domain status, OTOH, is a different matter.  Best
consult the spec for details of that.

Right.  We are not "state-of-the-art" in CPU's.  Of course I realize why,
and it's because the market does not justify the hardware changes for our
providers.

This is what we need to do more of.  I had intended to try to accomplish
some of this stuff, but it seems I'm not making much progress... I seem
to be running in circles trying to figure out what I want to tackle first <G>

Exactly.. What I want to see more than anything is the ability to blend in
with the existing world..  We can go our own route in many things, but
I think the main thing we need is the ability to blend utilize what already
exists..  IMO, if one could read in a WordPerfect file he was working on
at work and edit it (possible copyright problems here, but just an example),
then this would give us opportunity to recommend an OS9 System.

As I stated in a recent message, right now, I think a critical niche that
needs addressing is Internet access - that is WWW compatibility, etc.  I
believe this aspect alone is causing many of our users to drift away and
adopt PC's.  And let's face it.  Regardless of what we think of the systems,
once someone gets one of them and starts using it, there will be no need
to come back to the coco (I think these are the main ones who are giving
up).  Most think they will keep working on the coco, but aside from reasons
based on nostalgia more than anything else, there are none.  Most will end
up letting their cocos sit or finally selling them off.

OK.. If you remember where you found it, give me a shout.  I'd like to
see how it works.. I wonder, when using RIP, does it send the actual
pictures and all or does it send codes to cause graphics that are resident
on the user's system to be displayed?   If I understand correctly, HTTP
basically tells the computer to show something (or display a text) that
it already has, and the actual data is not being transmitted.

To add 2 cents, if you plan to use OS/2 Warp, make sure it supports the video
board you use.  This is OS/2 Warp's biggest failing.  It does not recognize
all video boards and does not work with others. <girn>

Ya.. or at least make sure the vender of the video board you have has drivers

According to the SCSI.FAQ posted in the SCSI newsgroup on Usenet:

Parity is always ENABLED on the CP3200,CP30060,CP30080,CP30100,
CP 30200, CP 3500, CP 3360, CP 30540 and CP 31370.

For the CP 340, jumper E-1 to disable parity.

All other models, jumper E-4 to disable parity.


It appears your CP3040 would fall under the "all other models" category.

Hope this helps.

     One bedroom apartments are great for single people, _unless_
they  have to live with a CoCo company. So, I'm happy to announce
CoNect  has  moved  into more suitable quarters. Which  had  been
planned for some time, but not a month before the fest! Something
has  to give- for now, one victim is my Delphi account. I  expect
to be back harrassing everybody in person soon!

     The  reason  for  this post is to announce  Fast232  is  now
shipping-  we've a solid half dozen in stock, (now you know where
the  Delphi  money went!), boards for 15 more, and no  reason  to
stop  there! I'd like to thank the folks who so generously helped
us get this far.

     The  product  is impressive- look for our demo at the  fest!
Better  yet, don't wait! Else the demo's might the the only units
left;-)

Yes, I definately look forward to having a nicely running MM/1 sytem.
The current hold up seems to be that he is working on a new I/O board,
and so I can't get a hard drive or othere stuff until he finishes that,
which may not be for a while.  He says I can get a new RAM card/backplane
for $125 without it though, for more ram and could set up a ram drive.

> RE: the C compiler.. Didn't you get a C compiler with your system?

I'm not certain now, but am pretty sure they said it would be supplied
along with the hard drive when they sent it, along with all the other
PC floppy drivers and networking and other misc. utilities.  Appearnetly
easier to put it all on the hard drive and ship it as one..  It is
possible I might have the C compiler, but if I do it must have been
non-useful with the one working floppy I had and I never used it.
I'll rumage through my floppies I got with it sometime soon and see
again what all I got.  If I can still find them at least. :-)

Oh, a new world will open up to you with the HD..  Of course, if you have
a coco and a HD, you will realize that already..

You should have it on your system distribution disks.. They would be cc,
o68, r68, in a CMDS dir, and some files with ".l" extension in a LIB dir.

It might be a little difficult to use without a HD, though, although not
impossible.

I'm not sure about whether dmode accepts changing the port address or not.
Seems like maybe it won't.

You might do it with modpatch.  Get the offset (save it to disk and dump
it, finding the Old address, whatever it is..  make a file like this.

   l h0 <or whatever>
   c <offset> <oldvalue> 74
   v

Note: the lines need to start at left margin, and don't leave any
blank lines, modpatch will abort if you do.

Then cobbler a new disk, or first, I'd save the new descriptor into your
MODULES directory of your configure disk or directory.

Actually, I've not had pleasing results with cobbler with Level 2..  I
would usually just os9gen a new boot disk.

My message did indeed get chopped big time! Anyway, I discovered the problem
easy enough after a short phone conversation. The version of dmode I was
using had been patched to accept DECIMAL numbers to make things easy... I
was putting in HEX numbers without a leading $ (required for hex input on
this version). So THAT was the problem! Thanks for answering anyway.

dmode doesn't normally change the port address, that's why the version I was
using was hacked.. to change port address and to accept decimal input as
well as hex! I was inputting hex without a leading $, required for hex
input.

     Greetings all-

     This  is Ricku- I've infiltrated the good Brother's  account
to ask your help.

     The  problem is Fast232, or rather a demo of it. Logging  in
to  this  box  from the shop (at 115.2k) looks exactly  like  the
console,  down  to  all  the little hitches  we  know  and  love.
I  could print a line that says 'Supercomm 2.3' on the screen and
fake  it;-)  Shuffling a program between ramdisks is better,  but
not very visual.

     What  I'd  like to do is dump a decent sized vef  direct  to
remotes  screen. Sort of a precusor to a web viewer. But time  is
short.   If anyone has helpful comments/bits, you'll  immediately
become on of my favorite people!

92334 13-APR 20:11 OSK Applications
     Zip and Directories??
     From: DBREEDING    To: ALL

Does anyone use "zip" much?

Recently, I was zipping some files to put on a PC disk for a friend, trying
to get it as close to 1.44M as possible..  In the process I got it too
big and used the command "zip -d..." to delete a few files.

I discovered my directory was munged.  Got that straightened out.. In the
process, I munged my directory a couple more times.

All along, I had been using ZIP, "ZIP -d", and writing to the PC disk.

So far, I don't think I have lost anything..  In one case, after deleting
the ".zip" file on the HD, one little file (about 900 bytes, using 1 sector
for FD and 2 for data) had lost its allocation in the bitmap.. I think that
the .zip, or one of the tmp files zip had created, had walked over that
file and used its allocation in the bitmap and when it was deleted, of course
the sectors the little file was using were deallocated, too..

Since then, I've been experimenting on a floppy (kinda slow), but have come
up with errors, often when the zip file is finished (after deleting some
of its files), none of the sectors are allocated in the bitmap.  It
doesn't always do it..  I don't know if it has something to do with
fragmentation or lack of it or what or whether something about my system
is giving me trouble.

I wish some of you would run some tests to see if you can duplicate the
error..  It seems to occur when using "zip -d" and I've been deleting 2
files at once.. haven't worked with one or any other number.

I'm wondering if zip does some "cheating" or something and do its own thing
on the directory structure.  I have the source code, but haven't had time
to look at it.

If it _is_ a problem with zip, I don't know any specifics.. What I've been
doing is copy a zip I have with several files (Oh, my zip files are in
PKZIP format ) and I try to have one pretty big file in it (don't know if
that has any effect or not).  I have gotten this error by copying the
existing zip to a blank diskette then naming 2 files to delete - again I
don't know if 2 is a magic number or not.  I am using zip V1.0  .
