Yes, there are still some OS9 fans around. I know for sure that I'll use it
throughout '95 (in my CoCo 3) and for what I can project, '96 should be also a
good year to do something with OS9. I recently got my hands on several OS9
packages: C, Pascal, D.L.Logo, DeskMate3... and have been having a ball souping
them up to OS9LII (like Logo) and doing some basic (still) C and Pascal
programs... it seems like my CoCo OS9 time for '95 is allocated :-)

I'll try to get to this forum an excerpt from an article about the taken and
brought subject of "Plug and Play"....... and what us OS9ers have been having
for YEARS NOW!!

Hi there. I have an interest in getting OS9 up and running in a very simple
6809 environment.

It's got one serial port and a terminal (Soroc IQ120, if it matters... I can
make it act like anything I want to in point of fact). It's currently set for
56k of ram and 8k of ROM, but I can change that, too.  So, how do I go about
obtaining OS9 for this thing? Anyone know? Should I contact Microware, or are
there dealers for this kind of thing? For that matter, is Microware still the
owner, or a going concern?

Thanks for any information. This project has been stalled for a long time, and
I'd *really* like to get it up and running.

Some of the rest can answer that question better than I, but FWIW, I would
suspect that if a system has been developed for that machine, you would
probably have to contact some middle party.  MW provides only the Kernel for
the system, and the people down the line develop the drivers etc.

Oh, yes, they ave very much a going concern.  Currently, they are involved in
the video-on-demand projects.

Well, if your main concern is just to get OS9/6809, and you don't have any
particular reason to put this machine in gear, I would suggest you get a Tandy
Color Computer 3 with OS/9 Level 2.  It will support lots of memory - they
currently have boards that will expand memory up to 2 Meg.  The drivers and
quite a bit of software are already here, and it's quite a potent machine.

Well, "that kind" of a machine is in fact not a machine at all, but an
emulation. What it is an emulation _of_, at least right this second, is an SS50
machine with Psymon monitor. I can load any monitor you please (assuming I have
code for it, anyway... I have GMXBUG and SWTBUG as well as Psymon, but they're
pretty poorly designed by comparison, IMHO)

I think Microware would be the place to start, as I can write the drivers
(disk, serial, timers, etc) very easily, inasmuch as I can define those things
to do anything I want. :-)

Unless someone sells a new serial based OS9, or someone has an old version.

I do have a CoCo, _and_ the originally released version of OS9 for it, but
that's not licensed for the kind of use I intend to put it to - only for use on
the old CoCo, which isn't up to the computing speed I have available in the
emulation (which is actually running under a 25 mhz 68040 and runs considerably
faster than a 2 mhz 6809)... more like 5, of which there aren't any. :-)

OK, I see..  Then probably what you need to do is to see what MW can do for
you.  I really don't know how they operate in this regard.  The only problem
might be that they might not sell a license for one machine, but it doesn't
hurt to ask.

Yes, there _would_ be something of a difference.  I have now gone to a
68020-25MHz running OS9/68K (from Delmar).  There is quite a difference in the
speed between the two.

I hope you can find what you need.. and maybe someone else here can help to
steer you in the right direction.

Sb: #A few questions
Fm: David Breeding 72330,2051
To: all

I have a few questions about a few oddities with my connects here and I was a
little curious.

It seems that at apparently random times, on logon, I get a message "Go RULES
for Service Agreement Clarification".  I might get it on one logon, then log
back on a few minutes later and it is not there.  I've gone to RULES and can't
find anything that looks like I would need to go.

It seems that now, using maybe OSTerm on my CoCo or STerm with my System 5, on
logoff, most times, the line that has "Connect time" does not complete. I often
get "Connect time =", or sometimes less than that.  However, with InfoXpress, I
usually get the complete string.  I now use error-correcting modems with both
systems.. Is the carrier dropping before all the text gets to the computers or
what?

Another little thing that strikes me as odd.. I have my modems set up to do the
whole progress report, "CARRIER..., PROTOCOL..., CONNECT".  When logging onto
CIS, it rapidly goes to the end of the CONNECT string, but hesitates before
putting the computer CONNECT rate value up.  This hesitation is not there on
any other system.  This is on the CoCo, and with "ix", seems like the OSK
system does the same (different modem).  I had thought it was possibly a flow
control thing, but from the looks of things, there is no difference in the
amount of text in the CIS logon sequence at this point than any other, so I'm
kinda curious.

If I don't get the answers to these pressing questions, I'll try to survive
somehow (G)..  Naw.. it's just an "inquiring minds want to know" sort of thing.

It's nothing to worry about, David. I think that banner is tied to a flag that
gets flipped periodically by the folks in Columbus anytime they make a
significant change to the service agreement. It may even be tied to the What's
New pages that pop up each Thursday.

Doubtful. I see that from time to time as well. I just chalked it up to a
buffer not getting fully processed.

Gee .. so you really have this much free time?? :-)  I've got a few projects
that have been hanging around for a while! Seriously ... I've not a clue. Does
this happen _everytime_ you log in?

I thought it might be something like this.  I just wondered if I needed to
check things out, but as I said, I've gone in to look and found nothing.

RE: connect time not showing all the time

 > Doubtful. I see that from time to time as well. I just chalked it up to a

Again, this is what seems more apparent to me.  But I wondered why one comm
package would complete the string and others wouldn't.  Again, it could be in
the  speed the comm programs process the data, and it could be that the carrier
being dropped might cause anything in the buffer to be lost.

Yeah, every time.. There's a pause right after CONNECT, maybe 2 seconds, then
4800 comes up (that's the speed I have my coco set to connect).  But with
Delphi and everywhere else, it's all one swoop, and I would suspect that THIS
comes from the modem.  Again, it could be a halt from the coco, but if I
remember, it's the same with the OSK computer, can't remember.

Well, none of this stuff is really a problem, but I just get curious about
stuff like this... <G>

Hope you are having a great holiday.

When I dial the 2400 baud access number I always have the "connect time"
message chopped off; but on the 9600 baud line it always works. And since I am
using the same computer, modem and software I have to figure that it is a CIS
problem. Of course, you could always "ask customer service" and then, after
they ask you which version of CIM you are using, you still would not know the
answer. It'll probably just remain a mystery <g>.

Well, it doesn't matter that much, but I was just curious.  I don't think it is
ever chopped off on my coco using 2400 modem, coco set @ 4800.  But with
OSTerm, it usually is.

Oh, you think they might be thrown for a loop when I tell them I'm using
OSTerm, or STerm..  Think they might not be really up-to-date on those
programs?   <G>

Actually, What Steve said was something I thought maybe.. that the rest of the
string might be still in the Modem buffer and (my thought), when CD dropped,
this was lost.  Anyway, if that's the biggest online problem I ever have, I
think I will survive  ;-)
