  This makes sense, since there will be a `standard' platform coming

Interesting, indeed. I haven't seen the InfoMagic release of Linux but it
does sound like it's quite a bundle of stuff with three CDs. I found one
company selling the Slackware release for about $80 or so and decided to
skip it until I found a better deal elsewhere. Oh well, I really don't have
enough room left to install Linux anyway. Maybe after the dust settles I'll
pick up a new box and dedicate this one to Linux.

Well, this is partially true for me, too.  But I do have this ambition of
perhaps developing some good user programs to help get at least a small
foothold in the personal market.  Probably will never happen in the way
I see it, but I still have this hope.

It's the most significant bit, to be exact <G>  But yes, something like
this is a real educational experience... Often in my attempts to write
programs, I've taken off on a tangent exploring some little quirk that
has nothing to do with the program on which I'm working.

Hi Dave,
  Yeah, well you know what they say...  "That's life in the BIG
city."  Last Sunday I spent 6 hours and 8 minutes on line, 4
of which was on the Internet.  I think I have finally gone
over my 20 hours on Delphi.  I will know when I get my next
statement.  Needless to say, I will not be going on the Internet
today, for that reason and because I have to do some
studying on this course in Computer Repair I am taking.  Got
a new hands on kit in the mail yesterday,  I like "hands on"!
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

Peace and Long Life...

Yes, sometimes it seems so hard to find time to do all you want to do..
And writing programs is so time-consuming, at least for me.. Programming
is actually a learning project for me, and often I find myself stumbling
across some feature and begin studying it and experimenting with variations
on it.  Many times I spend maybe a week exploring this new "feature" before
I get back to my main programming project.

Right now, I'm finally beginning to get into G-Windows programming.  There
is a whole bunch of calls and stuff I'll need to get familiar with.  The
Development System I got has about 270 pages (size of those for OS9 L-2
docs).  Mostly you have one code per page.  Well - actually they are
for the most part parameters passed by one of two functions, and these
functions have a Set and a Get function call.  I just spent a week trying
to figure out how to get the text to write in the correct colors, and it
was pretty simple after it finally dawned on me. <G>

Wow!  Where do you put them all?  I actually own 4, my Delmar machine,
One coco-3 set up on the kitchen cabinet, another coco-3 at my brother's,
and a coco-2 I loaned out (and never expect to get back).  I would like
to have a "mainline" machine but have no idea where I'd put it <G>...

Well, there's no doubt that it's at the very least an expensive proposition
by the time you get everything you need.  And if you need compatibility,
then you need your compatible machine first.  But I must say that I'm
really having a ball with my system.  At times I look at the compatible
people and wish I could do a few of the things they are doing, but maybe
someday...

Hi Dave,

  I have a 2 bedroom apartment (living alone) and I have set up the
smaller one for my computting and course studies.  I have a computer
desk with printer stand that I have this CoCo 3 sprawled all over.
This is along 2 walls.  Right next to the desk I have a 3 drawer
dresser which holds all my CoCo software, blank disks, PC software,
printer ribbons...  On it I have a CoCo 3 with 512k that I use for
playing games on, when I get a chance.  On the 3rd wall I have a
conference table where I do my course studies.  I have a CoCo 2
stored in the corner where the table and dresser meet.  In the
closet, I have my original CoCo 3 stored for sentimental reasons. I
also have my computer books and more software on the shelf.  In the
other bedroom I store all the rest of the computers and peripherals.
I even have the Xenix OS and software for a 286, if you can believe
that.  Why?  I do not know!  Maybe I will give one of these 486s to
my son and use his 286 to check it out.  Who knows?
  All I need now, to get my 486 launched, is memory and video.  I
can taste the speed on the Internet already.  I would say that it
will be running within the next 2 months.
  I just got a line on an 85Meg HD that I want for this CoCo.  MFM,
will not have to fiddle with the RLL any more.  I know this one is
in good condition, it sits in a 386 at work which is just idle right
now.  The boss is going to get new software for the company, against
my better judgement, but then again, he's the BOSS.  The software
owner wants to see if he can use the 386 as a server with a SCSI
drive in it.  I can see the boss' point, local support and such.  I
just do not like the software.
  Well Dave, I hope you have a better idea as to where a packrat
keeps all his computers.  One of these days I am going to have to
take some of this stuff to the swap meet and sell it to someone
else like me. :>  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

Unfortunately, the SCII and the B&B require a MultiPak.  However, if you
did have low power draw packs, you can run a multiple y-cable.  The one
on our OS-9 Level II BBS has a 4 way cable, with an LR Tech HD interface,
a Ken-Ton Dual Comm pak, a Tandy Floppy Controller, and at this time a
spare in case we want to add another Dual Comm pak for 4 lines.  We used
to have 2 running, but with declining membership, we reduced it to 1
line.  The club is the Erie County Color Computer Club (ecccc), and have
been around since about 1982.  The BBS number is (716)649-1368, 8 bit,
not parity, 3/12/2400 bps.  Our newsletter is available for downloading
on our system. Usually only a page or two, so long distance won't be

  Just a quick thought. You did use a driver that is capable of formatting
the drive?? Yes??? If the driver BB??hdisk does not have an F in it i.e.
BBFhdisk, the driver will not format the drive. This would give you the 208

and have updated many of my other system modules as well.  My system
clock is updated from the hardware clock about every minute.  The
system clock is automatically set at bootup without the use of B&Bs
clkget module.  I do use the clkset module to update the hardware
clock such as when we have a time change.  I do not remember any-
thing said about the slot # being, what did you say, 1 less than
what is entered into ddmaker.  I will go over my docs for the B&B
interface and ddmaker to verify this and if so will redo my descrip-
tor again.  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

Hi Chris,
  When I originally setup an HD on this CoCo, I renamed the format-
table driver BBFHDISK to BBHDISK so that I could format a sec-
ond hard drive as well.  I cobblered a freshly formatted disk using
the OS9Boot file on the ST-225 and only updated the hd module for
use of the RLL HD..  I think I am going to persue the idea that
Gene gave me about the slot # being 1 less than that which is entered
into ddmaker.  Since I entered slot #3 I will put the controller
into slot #2 and see if this solves the problem with my ERROR 208.

     RE: RLL HD Troubles. (Re: Msg 92504)
     From: WDTV5        To: 01GEN40

When I was refering to the slot being 1 less than the number on the mpi
slot, that was in reference to slot 1 actually being a zero in the
descriptor, etc. ddmaker as I recall, handles that. The clock you're
running however may not be as bulletproof. I tried to use that one myself
and wound up disassembling it to find that not all the so-called ed 9
fixes were in it. I seem to recall that after 2-3 aborted attemps to
repair it, i gave up and went back to the ed 9 version. Then about that
time, I bought a supercontroller II and 4n1 plus a 7120s Maxtor drive.
So I had to start fixing clocks all over again and eventually have one
that works for this Nitros9 system and the 4n1. Now the only problem
with it is the powerup/down glitches will destroy one, sometimes 2 of
the hardware registers in this clock chip requireing it be set again.
Problems with that, along with the need to drop back to (ugghhh) RSDOS
to set the thing caused me to rewrite the clock again. This one sets
itself from the hardware every few minutes and at bootup, has an alarm
that works, has the F$Stime added back in so I can use "setime" to set
it, all that. I've passed it out here and there but I don't know at this
late date if its in the database here. Its pretty specific to the Disto
4n1 and Nitros9 though. For anyone who has this setup, I'd be glad to
mail it to them if they request it. As to the -27x controller, I've
had lots of errors made byt it. But time will tell, I now have the
drive on my office machine running as an MFM drive in tandem with an
awfully old 10 meg Tandon which has never lost a byte! If the drive
turns flacky now at MFM standards, then it really was a junker all along.
Give me another month and I'll be able to tell. I seemed to reduce, but
not kill completely, the errors I had by replacing the -27x with a
Seagate ST-11r controller. That required a reformatting of the drive as
the two rll controllers apparently didn't in fact speak the same
language at the drive cable.
Let me look around and see if I can ident the clock I tried to patch
up for that setup. If my notes say it worked, I'll mail you a copy.
The stocker for that setup will miss up to 4 chars in a row several
times a minute while downloading at 2400 baud, thats its trademark.
Good luck otherwise Gene, Gene

Hello Gene,
  Don't you just hate it when someone says "Hi Gene"?  Makes you
think of cleanlyness!
  I have not had a chance to work on the RLL descriptor again.  Be-
sides that, I just got a line on an 85Meg MFM Seagate HD.  It sits
in a 386 at work and I told the boss I wanted to by it if we use it
(the 386) as a server with a SCSI drive in it.  He has already told
me I could.  I may just let this RLL collect dust.
As far as the clock, I have had absolutely no problems with it. I
would have to check my logbook to see which clock module it is that
I found.  As far as disassembly and hacking, the closest I came to
doing something like that was when I did my patch to INIT to load
cc3go from the CMDS directory and a 1 byte fix to fix something that
was mentioned by Kevin Darling.  I would have to read the docs to
remember what it was.  If I remember right, I think it had something
to do with the device table, ahh I do not remember.  That was about
3 years ago I think.  That 1 byte fix was also done by accident.  I
knew about it and changed it somewhere along the line.
  You know, I just thought of something.  An MFM HD cannot be used
as an RLL but, if I am not mistaken, I think that an RLL can be used
as an MFM.  I seem to remember reading about that somewhere.  Is it
possible to do?  If it is, that will be my second course of action
if I cannot get the 85 Megger.
  Thanks for the reply...  See ya among the stars...

Well, the way it works, for both the Chicago and Atlanta Fests, is that
a local club set sponsers it, does all the work organizeing it, puts out
the initial capital for reserveing a place to hold it, aranges hotel "bargins",
makes up add copy, and all that "leg work". So the odds of a Fest happening
somewhere else (like D.C.) is dependant on if there is a strong support group
already in that area to do that kind of work and to make the financial
commitment. If one happens, though, I'll be there. Always wanted an excuse

I'm pretty sure that Terry is referring to "OS-9" manuals, in case you
were confused.  He seems to have a problem with his "9" key.

Looks like an offer that will be of interest to anyone who has had their manuals

The only problem with the Atari is that OS9 is ridiculously expensive.  I
think it's around $600?  Didn't look, but I think that's right.  You can
almost get a terminal system complete with OS9 and all for that price.

Yes, but just because OS9 is availiable for SOME poerePC based
(PowerPC) based VME boards does not imply that we will be able to
install it on a personal computer and develop software for industrial
control systems in the office.  I just happen to believe that one
would be better off with software that ALSO runs on desktop systems,
rather than having to depend on cross-compilers, Unibridge, or
what-have-you.  I was reading an article tonight by some GM engineers
who advocate using Windows NT for the "standard" OS for control
systems.  They specifically mention OS9 as not being suitable due to
it's proprietary nature (like, non-standard) and that it does not
use the "standard" Windows GUI.  I suppose they want to have Excel
spreadsheet and other "standard" applications running on the system.

         The only flaw in that logic is that, as I understand it, OS-9000
       will allow the execution of just about any Dos and/or Windows
       program. Unless they know of a way one of those programs might not
       work under an OS-9 environment, there is no reason OS-9000 can't
       use the "standard" GUI(you know, the one that will be obsolete

It is true that one can run Windows under OS-9000, I believe it is
only in "real mode"--No extended memory.  I have played around with
OS-9000 a little and since that was almost a year ago, I have forgotten
a lot.  Also, it may be changed by now.  I did get the impression that
it was like having two separate computers, an OS-9000 system and a
DOS sytem at the same time.  One thing we never got worked out was
a clean "tunnel" between the two systems.  It was like having  two
separate computers to such an extent that one might as well have bought
two cpu's.

     F$Fork & F$Wait
     From: WDTV5        To: ALL

Howdy all; I have a bit of a programming connundrum that I sure could
use some help with.

My current programming project can launch other programs using the
F$Fork system call, but may or may not be asked to synchronize itself
with the child process by immediatly doing the F$Wait call.

The problem I forsee is that if it chooses not to do the F$Wait because
the child launching parameter line contained an ampersand(&) indicating
the child is to run concurrently. Having previously attempted to pass
the & on to the child, only to have the Wait call return it as the error
variable in regs.b, I am now attempting to handle that in the caller
instead of the system/child by skipping the Wait instead of passing
the & in the parameter area.

However, my program still needs to know when the child process dies
so it can do any required "cleanup", like telling the shell to shut
the logging back off for instance.

How can I know when the child process has died without doing the Wait?
Cheers all, Gene Heskett

Gene,

 Yep, as you found out, the "&" is a shell switch to not F$Wait. The system
doesn't know a thing about it. As far as tracking children without waiting (hand

and foot) on them can be done various ways in special cases. I can't think of a
generic way to do it... which is probably why shell doesn't.

 Ah... I got a way... but it requires VRN. Have the parent set up a signal trap,

and then open a path to VRN and request a cyclic repeating timer signal. While
you have children forked off, periodicly issue a F$Wait. The signal from VRN
will wake you back up. When you wake up, test to see if it was a wait return, or

a signal.

 With dedicated parent and child, it would be easier to have the child send a
signal to the parent just before exiting. Parent gets signal, issues F$Wait to
clean system, then does any final cleanup required.

Unforch, that would require re-writing everything in the cmds dir plus
a wagon-load of scripts in order to make them return the signal. The vrn
idea intrigues me tho, is that in the docs for vrn? Presntly I'm keeping
the ID of the child, and doing an F$GProcP each minute to see if I get
an error if that ID no longer exists, but its now leaving a DEAD path
in the pathtable for each pass thru the loop. In 15 mins the table
fills up, and it error 237 time from then till reboot for anything.
I'll give that some attention tho, might just be what the doctor ordered.
Thanks Randy, Gene

     Fest
     From: REVWCP       To: ALL

My dear friends:

Once again another Fest has come to a close.  It was a wonderful
time, and while I am certain that Allen Huffman will once again
post his Fest review, I would just like to comment that, from
my humble perspective, it was a success.  There was new hardware
and software.  Rick Ulland of Conect debuted the Fast232 serial
port, and Northern Exposure had an AT Keyboard Adapter.  Nitros9
1.21 was available.  And Chris Dekker, an extremely talented
programmer, who does a lot of work in Basic09 had several
excellent pieces of software, including BasicBoost, which speeds
up Basic09/RUNB and ScreenBoost.  ScreenBoost, is a "monk-must".
It greatly speeds up GRFDRV and does such neat things as
horizontal scrolling on type 2 text screens.  There were lots
of other new things for both OS-9 and OSK.  Please forgive me
for not mentioning all of you by name, but it is somewhat late
for me as I am writing this.

On a more personal note, it was certainly a great joy for me to
be able to attend.  It is always so wonderful to see so many old
friends again, and get to put names and faces together of new ones.

I would be remiss if I did not publically offer my heartfelt
thanks to all who put in so much time and effort to make this
fest possible.  Glenside, and in particular, Tony Podraza, did
an outstanding job.

Finally, thank you to all of you for the many acts of kindness
which you showed me once again.  The warmth of your greetings,
the conversations, and the special times we had together are a
blessing to me.  Your friendships are very precious to me.  Thank
you for allowing me to be with you and for sharing a part of your
life with me.

to Glenside and all interested parties:



  I  would  like  to officially register not only as the first
  attendee for the May 18th and 19th 1996 Fest in  Chicago  (I
  already  have  a  room  reserved)  but  I would also like to
  officially register to be an exhibitor.  With  all  the  odd
  equipment  I  have  managed  to  accumulate,  (The Prototype
  COCO3's used by Microware to write OS9 Level 2, plus a  copy
  of  the  never released Level 2 Upgrade) I figure I might as
  well have a booth.  Who  knows  I  might  even  have  a  few
  products  to  sell.   Perhaps a new vendor is on the horizon

92520 2-MAY 23:30  General Information
     Fourth "Last" Chicago CoCoFest
     From: JEJONES      To: ALL

First, a disclaimer--I didn't take notes, and what I noticed is a function
of my personal interests and erratic-at-best observational abilities.  The
following is going to reflect that, and if I've left anything or anyone out,
it's due to my lapses, not by intent.  OK?

That said, here's my Fourth Annual "Last" Chicago CoCoFest saga.  It started
long ago in a state far, far away, with two young men amazed that they'd
rented such an atrocious video: *Luther the Geek*.

Some years later, one of the two, Boisy Pitre, came to work for Microware
and found (1) a fan of bad movies among his new coworkers and (2) mirabile
dictu, a copy of *Luther the Geek* for rent at a Hy-Vee store.  He and the
coworker--me--watched the movie and somehow managed to see through tears of
laughter as the debits rolled by that (1) the movie is an example of Your
Tax Dollars at Work, being a result of the University of Iowa Film Production
Project, and (2) the movie was filmed in Stirling and Rock Falls, Illinois.
Boisy realized that Stirling was on the scenic route that we took to the
Third "Last" CoCoFest in 1994...and it was clear that this year would be
a Pilgrimage of sorts.

The weather started out gray, but cleared as we entered Illinois, and not
long afterward we stopped at the Casey's near the edge of Stirling.  I'm
constitutionally incapable of keeping a straight face, so I let Boisy ask
the lady at the counter.  She seemed reluctant to admit that Stirling was
the home of *Luther the Geek*--but admitted it, and explained to her
younger coworker.  For a second she was incredulous that we'd come to
Stirling because of the movie, but we assured her this was the path we'd
taken for other purposes, and that *Luther* was just icing on the cake,
or perhaps I should say the batter on the chicken.

We asked her what store a certain scene was filmed in, and she told us
Kroger's.  That was our next stop, and with a little additional help on
the way, we found it.  An employee there knew about the movie, but didn't
seem terribly enthusiastic.  We visited the dairy case, and then went
on our way.

The best thing about the Fest--meeting friends--started upon our arrival.
(I had my first view of Frank Swygert's 1963 Rambler, a beautfully-
maintained car.)  The Hawkses kindly helped us get into our room, and
after dinner, I gave an impromptu demonstration of recursive descent parsing.
I was anxious to buy a CD-ROM drive, but Boisy was more so, and he had
his installed Friday night!  More familiar faces appeared as the evening
went on.

Mostly technical things that stick out in my mind:

 1. The 68306-based computer, running and on display.

 2. The HAWKSoft CD-ROM file manager--they sold out of drives in short
    order.  There are LOTS of CD-ROMs containing source code that is
    begging to be ported out there...

 3. Planet Engine running on the MM/1.

 4. LA-Term.  (*Very* nice looking terminal program.)

 5. Ongoing optimizations in NitrOS-9.

 6. Brother Jeremy's ongoing work to revive abandoned software...and
    his musical plea to Kevin Darling (not to be confused with a certain
    Conway Twitty song, despite having the same first two words).  This
    and the Planet Engine port clearly display that talking to the author
    and/or vendor of software no longer sold is not only preferable to
    rationalizing the piracy of so-called "orphanware," it has better
    results.

 7. Chris Dekker's very neat graphics displays (and his setup that
    uses a serial link to a PClone to let the CoCo use the PClone's
    hard drive).

 8. The continued efforts of vendors and the OS-9 Users Group--they
    deserve your support.

 9. The Iomega Zip drive that Dave Pellerito had hooked up to his MM/1.
    $200 for an outboard SCSI drive that takes removable media about
    the size of a 3.5" floppy but holding 100 Mbytes.  About 30 ms
    access time, and the medium is about $20 a shot.  (Maybe it's
    time to sell my floptical...)

10. Frank Swygert's edited and updated printing of Paul Ward's *Start
    OS-9* under the title *Mastering OS-9 on the Tandy Color Computer 3*.
    It's a book well worth having, and the only thing I wish were
    different is the binding--like the Tandy OS-9 manuals, it's a bit
    too small for the amount of paper therein.

This is far from a complete list of all the cool stuff that was there
to be had--heck, it doesn't even list all the things I bought (though
I didn't buy everything listed; if nothing else, the Zip drive wasn't
for sale).  I'll have to leave it to others to do a more complete report.
In any case, it seemed to me that there were as many people and vendors
as last year, and I hope to be in Elgin once again next year.  (I know
I'll be in Atlanta this October.)

Also omitted above is a lot of pleasant conversation and dining with
old friends--all of whom I know better than I know the people who
live in the condos next to mine.  Thanks, and I hope to see you regularly.

Opinions herein are solely those of their respective authors.

It should do so automatically if you have your device descriptors installed.
Doesn't it?  Do you have your 40T-DS descriptors in your bootfile for your
M-V disk?  This is all it should take.

Not so atuomatically at all.  MV want's unmodified disks to install on.  I
edited the bootlist.mv files for 40d.dd but when I try to use os9gen I get
error #21
Not sure just what I'm doing wrong.  Thanks in advance for any help.

 Does anyone know if the hd63c09e is compatible with nitros or will nitros run
only with the 6309b variety? Beyond that, Does anyone know of or have a spare
6309 chip that they would be willing to part with for monetary renumeration:->
