I had heard talk about this program for a while, and then found this
echo.  Is there anyone alive out there?  Anyone who uses this software
and this echo on the Atari ST?  What exactly is OS9 and what does it do,
ect... cost?  Details!  I want details! ;)

Steve,
    OS9-68k is available for the Atari ST but I do not have details on
where to get it.  There is a local (San Diego) member of our OS9
Usergroup that runs it on his Atari ST and maybe he can help.
His name is Tom Birt.  You can leave mail to him on this echo or call him 
voice (619) 697-3161.
     I am running OS9 lev II on a CoCo w/6309 CPU, this BBS, and also a
MM/1 that will soon be running this BBS. The version of OS9 on my MM/1 is 
V2.4 and vastly faster and more robust than OS9 on the CoCo.

Collin let the gentleman on FIDO who sent me his MM/1 and accelerator for 
repair that the accelerator module works OK. The problem is somewhere on 
the MM/1 boards. I will let him know as soon as the problem is located.

I have a demo program that compiles basic OSK to a assem program.
The demo is limited to only 1-2 pages of source.  Info is included on
ordering commercial versions with more capacity from $99 to $350 from
Frank Hogg Labs.
It is on my OSK-SYSTEMS download area with name 'CBDEMO.LZH'.

Anyone trying to send me Internet E-Mail to 'warren@ocnbeach.jd.com' will 
find it to bounce.  I just found out my gateway has crashed horribly, MS
dos running Unix, and he is out of town till April 7th.
So for the time being resend to me on this echo.
The RiBBS_OSK beta is now able to download/upload and work is going
forward on getting the Fido part setup.
Many thanks to John A. donaldson, Calvin Dodge, and William Chapple.

Steve,
      OS9 and OS9-68K are realtime, multitasking, multiuser operating
systems that are used in a great deal of realtime control applications
because they are preemptive multitasking realtime capable.
      They also provide those platforms with 68xx or 68xxx CPU's a very
capable personal desktop operating system as used with the CoCo III and
MM/1.  Industial users use VME bus system platforms and a few others.
       It is used by NASA on the space shuttle program, US Postal offices 
on there systems that weigh, price and issue stamps for mail and
packages.
       Even the old CoCo III with OS9 Lev II I have a BBS running in one
window, edit files in another window, use a term program in another
window and all can work at same time.  It may be described as a mini Unix 
system with many of the cmds that have been ported over.  For both
platforms there is term, database, word processor, and graphic shareware, 
freeware programs availble.  If you saw a demo of OS9 on an Atari with
the text windowing software 'Kwindows' you would be amazed at the
computing power you have even with only 1.5 - 2 meg memory.
      Again if you want first hand info call Tom Birt evenings at
(619)697-3161.

PS My BBS, listed below, has bulletin info on OS9 and MM/1's

Subject : RiBBS_OSK uploading

John,
     Well my first attempt at uploading bombed. The upload window comes
up but it crashes and locks up RiBBS  in the overlay window while
disconnecting the caller.  Must be some differance in cmds between what I 
have and what Calvin has.  I put files up in private downloads on my
idents and dir-e's of my cmds for Calvin and you to get and compare.
I think it is setbaud since Calvin mentioned setbaud.r1.b and I have
setbaud.r3.b that I use.  I put that in the private download section
also.
     Without my UUCP host working I feel like I have lost my right arm!
Anyway it should be back in couple weeks.
Warren
