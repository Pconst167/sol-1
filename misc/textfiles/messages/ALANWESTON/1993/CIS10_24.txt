   Yes, I intend to upload a new, improved, version of the patch.  In
 reviewing the stuff, SEVERAL errors have been found, especially in that
 register usages with W/E-F are not always consistent with those with
 D/A-B.  I think I have them all fixed now.  I am also working on operational
 improvements.  Some things I have fixed so far:
   1.  opt w is functional
   2.  opts were originally designed to be listed more than 1 per line
       such as:  opt l,d55,w60...  anything after a d?? or w?? was treated
       as a comment
   3.  Try opt d55 (or whatever) right after psect with the stock (or my)
       version.

 This is to ALL, really,  It has been suggested that I have r63 to delete
 the ".r" file upon error.  Any comments??  If so, how about an opt "k"(?)
 to override deletion?

 One other thought I have had is to include an opt to accept only 6809-
 compatible code.  It would require some bit of additional coding, but it
 would eliminate the possibility of assembling illegal code if assembling
 for the 6809.  Any thoughts?

 When I get it all fixed, I'll upload a new patch.  Anyone having any comments
 or suggestions is encouraged to do so.

 BTW, Wayne, if you wish, the current file may be deleted, as it is a little
 buggy.  Have you tried this patched "r63"?

Hey, Carl....

Have you by any chance dug up the source for CAWF, yet?

I have plenty of GNU man pages that have a FEW lines that CAWF chokes
on, and want to do a quick hack to fix  it.

Check with Mike Haaland.  I gave him the sources to mung and he has fixed
several of the problems, so you may not have to do anything.  If not, the disk
did surface for a moment during the great fall den cleanout, so it is probably
easier to find.

I wrote my own.  It supports Unix password encryption so that the password
file can be publicly readable.  This was done so that a user can specify
a username to 'chown' (specifying user number is also supported).  I had
actually written a lot of Unix style commands that can use the enhanced
features.  I haven't uploaded it anywhere, because I am undecided on how
to proceed with it.

Put that in the vendors announcement or whatever for me!  Thanks!  Couldn't

I'm open to approaching Wayne about rethinking the intended use of the Vendor's
Area. But I'd be a lot more comfortable in doing it, armed with a list of
vendor names that have agreed to use the area  (see the message on my proposed
list of vendor idea).

How about it folks? I'd like nothing better than to see an announcement in the
News Flash Bulleting stating:

"Vendors listed in the file SUPPRT.TXT found in Library 13 are actively
providing customer support for their products in the OS9 Forum"  or some such
words to that effect.

C'mon Vendors ... shoot me a copy of your listing and let's get this thing off
the ground!

Bob, There was a program called "SnapIt" on the "update" disk I got from IMS
that saves a screen to disk in IFF format, and another called iff2gif that
would convert the file to gif.

I think "SnapIt" (or a similar program) can also be found in Lib 12.

Thanks John. I got 'snapshot' from lib 12.

But I guess I'll have to ask for more help....

I want to write a little utility to dump screens to my laser printer. This
should include gfx screens being displayed by something like 'gifshow'.

'snapshot' will not save a 'gifshow' screen. And even if it did, it saves in a
compressed, undocumented format. Guess I have to figure out where the screen
memory actually starts, etc. I will play with the system calls in kwindows, but
I don't know if I can get all the needed information.

If someone has already done this, please let me know so I don't waste my
time...

Hi, Bob -

Remember that "kveddemo" slide viewer I ran for a while at AtlantaFest? It used
some routines Colin McKay put together to capture a screen image (with screen
type, palette info, etc.) to a disk file.  Should have the core of what you
need.

I'll check with Colin to see about getting a copy to you.

Cheers... / Ken

Thanks Ken, I decided to go documenation hunting and have found the necessary
calls in kwindows to find the screen, etc. I wrote a Q & D program to dump the
screen to the laser printer...works fine. However, before I share I do want to
clean it up a bit.

One of the Mikes  (Haaland maybe?) did Snapit and supposedly was included on
the upgrade disk (which I never received). As I understand it, Snapit save the
imape in IFF format.

Now Snapshot is a different story. I think that's Joel's and not sure what
format it's using.

I've run into the same problem you have ...trying to get hold of some good
graphic utilities for the MM/1 and KWindows. I even went so far as to post a
message to the COCO LIST. Got _1_ response.

Keep us posted on your progress ... I'm interested!

As per my earlier reply to KS, I have found the needed information. However,
the snapit program has got me wondering...where can I find the details on the
IFF format?

You might check out Mike Sweet's "imaster" in the lib.  It does a nice job
printing on my DeskJet and 24-pin epson with several flavors of graphics files.
I did some kinda primitive screen dump stuff with the idea of adding it to my
"CirCad" program -- better than no printout at all, but they look pretty bad
compared to the PostScript output. -- as soon as I am able, I could send you
some "C" source that you could maybe use as a starting point.  My MM/1 is down
for modifications at the moment, but should be back online soon.

I have uploaded a Q & D program to display a laser printer soft font on an mm/1
screen. It is not complete...and I don't think I will add much to it since I
just wanted it to see the results of a font modification program I'm trying to
get to work. If anyone is interesting in adding to it, etc....feel free. Look
for hpdisp.lzh in lib 12.
