Here's a quote from "Electronic Design", July 8/93, Page 71 in a article called
"Market Facts" reporting on the growth of the real-time software market:

"Accordingly, revenues for suppliers of real-time operating system products
amounted to $201 millon last year....Leading suppliers are Microware, Wind
River Systems, Intel, Novell/DRI, Ready Systems, Quantum Software Systems,
Software Components Group, and Motorola. Fastest growing companies, IDC says,
are Wind River Systems, Microware and Novell/DRI."

Sounds like you've been real busy getting 13 bit compression, etc. into AR.
I'm not using my 09 anymore but thought I'd make a suggestion about handling
recursive archiving.  Why not a command line switch?   Ah, never mind well,
yeah.  A switch, (-r or something), would grab the whole tree, no switch would
just grab the directory and contents on the command line.  If you'd like some
code to do this, check out lha.

For compression on binaries, you make the place where you start the header,
then keep track of how many bytes the file compresses to, if it's bigger than
the binary, seek back to the header and 'store' the file.

Hope to see the OSK version RSN. :)

No problem with the missing ".", Mike.  And I am real gratefull for the info.
Apparently the MicroWare Make is a little smarter than it looks (just the docs
are kinda dumb-- GRIN). Next time I tie into some monster UNIX program I want
to port, the makefile will be a lot simpler.

Thanks for the tips on keybindings.  BTW I've defined my Fn keys 1-10 thusly on
me MM/1.

    :k1=\E[M:k2=\E[N:k3=\E[O:k4=\E[P:k5=\E[Q:\
    :k6=\E[R:k7=\E[S:k8=\E[T:\

Emacs works with 'em.  These are the Vt-100 codes for the function keys. I load
'em from my startup file with display codes:

 * Load the global function keys
 * F1 = \E[M - F2 = \E[N - F3 = \E[O - F4 = \E[P
 * F5 = \E[Q - F6 = \E[R - F7 = \E[S - F8 = \E[T
 display 1b 2b f0 1 00 00 01 00 01 00 04 1b /[M/ 00
 display 1b 2b f0 2 00 00 01 00 01 00 04 1b /[N/ 00
 display 1b 2b f0 3 00 00 01 00 01 00 04 1b /[O/ 00
 display 1b 2b f0 4 00 00 01 00 01 00 04 1b /[P/ 00
 display 1b 2b f0 5 00 00 01 00 01 00 04 1b /[Q/ 00
 display 1b 2b f0 6 00 00 01 00 01 00 04 1b /[R/ 00
 display 1b 2b f0 7 00 00 01 00 01 00 04 1b /[S/ 00
 display 1b 2b f0 8 00 00 01 00 01 00 04 1b /[T/ 00

Since we don't have the use of f9 or f0 I've defined them as:

    :k9=\E\055:k0=\E\075:\

This translates to hitting Esc '-' for f9 and Esc '=' for f0. Fn11-20 I have as
Esc-1 thru 0.

    :F1=\E1:F2=\E2:F3=\E3:F4=\E4:F5=\E5:\
    :F6=\E6:F7=\E7:F8=\E8:F9=\E9:F0=\E0:

Seems to work well.

Your right the ncurses.l I'm using is the EFFO one, (I had to fix some of their
tc codes), and uses termcap.

 - Mike - PS. Sounds like fun trying to get your terminal to work correctly. :(

Guess your Fn key definitions make as much sense as anything else. I've got
mine set up to do 'useful' things like 'dir' and 'mfree'...however, I can never
remember which key does what, so I usually just type in the command anyway.
Would've been nice if Kev had defaulted the Fkeys to something so that we could
have a bit of a standard. Mind you, this way it sort of forces folks into using
termcap entry information...makes things more portable, for sure.

A spy! My life is more exciting than I realize... I would say there is a
tremendous relevance to the role that OS-9 plays in developing a CD-I title.
OS-9 is CD-I's guts, it handles all the machine's resources and keeps things
moving.

The MM1 (I think it stands for Multimedia 1) is a machine manufactured by
Interactive Media Services. They're a small company that developed the 68070
based computer.

The computer uses the same chip set as the CDI machines except I think it lacks
an extra video controller chip that the CDI machines have.  So, I'm not sure it
can handle CDI disks without further enhancement.

I currently own a 3 meg unit running OS9-68000 V2.4.  Several owners are here
in the sig, many more can be found over on Delphi.

It has stereo sound output and input, several different video resolutions, and
a palette of 16.7 million colors. The most you can get on one screen is 256.

Let's see, what else.... It has 2 parallel ports and up to 5 serial ports.
Memory can be 1, 3, or 9 megs.

The SCSI hard disk interface/software is pretty quick. I get about 1.1 megs/sec
(read) with my 170 meg Conner.

Hmmm... Do you suppose that the CD-I graphics controller bears enough
similiarity to the MM1 to coax it into running KWINDOWS? There may be a real
market for some of the things that have been developed for the MM1 on the CD-I
side... At least for developers.

The CD-I video chip is exactly the same VSC that is in the MM/1.  I don't see
why it can't run Kwindows.  Main problem would be having the programs right to
disk. :)  But for games like MineSweeper and Tetrix it shouldn't be too hard to
make 'em work.  From what I understand, the CD-RTOS has all the stuff Kwindows
does plus more.

Wonder how to get a development CD-I Box.

BTW, did anyone ever figure out how to make the standard CD-I consumer boxes

Brian,
        I got TASCOM as soon as it was released and I must confess that I have
never had much success with uploading or downloading with it.  Sometimes it
works, sometimes not.  I like to use TASCOM on DELPHI for the conference mode,
but I have given up on uploading and downloading.  I know this is not a lot of
help for your question, but here is what I do.

CIS upload and download -- STERM, CIS-B (STERM is avail on CIS and
        DELPHI and is included with the MM/1)

DELPHI download - Tascom,-- shell to rz (ZMODEM)

DELPHI upload - Aterm, xmodem (only thing I can get to work all the time).
                (ATERM is available on DELPHI and (I think) CIS.)


Some people seem to have a lot less trouble with TASCOM than you and I, maybe
they will chime in here.

Not too sure about tascom .... but the first thing I'd try is setting it to 8
bits, N and 1.

What protocol did you use?

And who is Ron?
