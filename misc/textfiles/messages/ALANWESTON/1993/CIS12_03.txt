Mark,
yes, I have seen Ghostscript in the forum library section before I posted the
message - I have also seen that actually very few people accessed it so that I
decided to mention the EFFO PD disks, sorry.

You need the format from OSK version 2.4. Can you post the output of an ident
on your format?

I just received the replacement for the bad 68340 accelerator board, and will
be playing with the MM/1 trying to make a HD bootfile and reconfiguring the
MM/1 to my liking, but in the future, I will be getting 9meg hack done bye You,
also will have to recover financyally
from the chrismas season, I have lots of grandchildren...

Thanks for working on ouer behalf, and furtering the OS9/OSK couse!!!

Sb: RBF utility
Fm: Mcgennity-M 100136,3276
To: ALL

Does anyone know of an OS9 equivalent of Norton Utilities for
RBF devices?

We work in OS9 for CD-I production and consequently have large SCSI
drives with assets stored on them. A file/directory/disk management
utility would be very valuable and would save valuable time in sorting out
directory structure and general disk management.

Some sort of tree based change directory utility (similar to Norton's ncd)
would be very useful.

If such a utility exists, who can we purchase it from and how much is it
likely to cost?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Bob,
unfortunately, srcdbg in gcc's -? listing means source level debugger (in
general) and not srcdbg from Microware. From 2.5.3 onwards, however, Stephan
Paschedag has implemented the -gg option that produces correct
*.dbg code for Microware's srcdbg. It is available through EFFO.

Since comp.os.os9 is an unmoderated newsgroup, I don't think it's available in
Digest form via Mail. There's a company that offers a nifty service for
CompuServe users that will digest newsgroups for you and send them to your mail
box. Take a peek at a file called IAS.INF in Library 14 of the TELECOM forum.

I'll have to research the FIDO question.
