Are you using shell+?  If so, try it using shell from Microware.  You may (I am
not the expert here) have to rename shell and patch the binary, but you should
be able to use 'mw_shell ar -u foo *' from the shell+ prompt.

    YES, as a matter of fact I do use shellpluss.  I was reading the other
messges on how to repair shellplus' memory bug.  I installed tha patch, and
BINGO, all aspects of the new ar. work flawlessly!

Hayes might help but I hasten to add that although my old 1200 baud unit has
been ultra reliable (and No I didn't buy it new - wadda ya think - I'm made of
money |-) ) BUT! the new 2400 baud which I borrowed from work folded up in
short order. The pulse dialing relay went intermittent and we have had one
other of these do the same. That is why the question about pulse dialing.  This
is the same relay which does the off hook function so you could still have
trouble there. }iUSR sporsters are not expensive. - in fact they are one of the
lowest priced name brands I have seen. Bob.

Oh, I forgot about that one. :-) You also need to make a special init module.
Just make a copy of the one you are using now and edit it with moded. Move down
to the item called "customization module list". It should have the value OS9P2.
Change it to "fpu  " without the quotes. I use the quotes to make the point
that you need to blank out the last two characters of OS9P2. Verify and write
the module and include it in your next gen.

 Scott,

 Look in your SYSMODS directory for 'init.a'.  You'll find the following
 code way down in the file -

          ifndef Extens
         Extens dc.b "OS9P2",0
          endc

 Change that as follows -

           ifndef Extens
          Extens dc.b "OS9P2 FPU",0
           endc

 Using the 'make' file provided, assemble the code.  This will generate a
 new 'init' module.  Make a new bootfile - don't forget to include 'FPU'.

Ed,

That is the proper way to do that, but unforch, init.a was not distributed with
the MM/1 for some reason.
