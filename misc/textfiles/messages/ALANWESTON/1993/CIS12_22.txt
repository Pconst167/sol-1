I've been having similar problems with an Force CPU30-MSM50 system. The file
structure on this system goes south on a regular basis. We've swapped out the
drive but that didn't make any difference. This system runs 24hrs a day and is
not subjected to many uncontrolled shutdowns. I have to reformat the drive to
recover, but as you know, this is a pain and it requires a process to be shut
down for the 3 to 4 hours it takes to get everything back on line. We've been
fighting this thing for three years now and had hoped 2.4 would help. It hasn't
and I haven't found anyone in Microware who is much help with this particular
problem.

 It's a shame Frank Hogg can't stick to facts and performance and has to
 resort to theatrics, hysterics and rhetoric.  He totally ignores his lies
 re the SYSTEM V.  He does not deny his hardware uses OSK Version 2.3 vs
 Version 2.4 nor his use of an obselete version of G-WINDOWS.  Further, he
 does not indicate any intent to upgrade his systems to current versions.
 Since he isn't supporting his products with upgrades, one can only wonder
 what kind of on-going support he will provide to software effecting a
 competitor's product.

 I think it's sufficient to say that my work has been subject to public
 scrutiny at 3 different shows; i.e., Chicago, San Diego and Atlanta.
 At the Atlanta show, several visitors did request verification of the
 test results I claimed here and in my advertising.  I was able to do
 this and subtantiated my claims.  In fact, the benchmark tests results
 were slightly better than I claim in my advertising.  At the San Diego
 show and the Atlanta show, comments were made comparing the performance
 of the SYSTEM V/G-WINDOWS favorably with SUN work-stations.  To my knowledge,
 Hazelwood/FHL's work has never been shown publicly and their claims have
 never been verified.  Further, FHL's claim of the fastest G-WINDOWS port
 under OS-9 is false.  There are at least 2 other ports from other OEM's that
 have performance far superior to that claimed by FHL.  The burden of proof
 of his claims is on FHL.  IMO, all other claims and statements from Frank
 Hogg should be taken in the same context.

 P.S. Frank Hogg offered to send 2 specific messages.  These will be out of
 context.  I'd suggest anyone wishing further information, request the
 entire thread, unedited.  Alternatively, I can provide all the messages
 comprising the thread.
