I see the uud utils you uploaded for OSK have a module called FPU.
Does it have to be made part of the bootfile, or can I just load

Ed,

 I think things are looking up here.  While this all may be a moot point, not
worthy of more thought investment until the port status is assured, I'm
already thinking on the possibilitiesof using KWin to run multiple GWin
sessions. :>

 Yes, the VSC, like the CoCo's gime, was designed to power a "state of the
art" game machine. :>
 But there is a limit in how much memory the VSC can access. The basic chip
design limits it to 1.5meg. In the MM/1, it can access all the memory on
the motherboard, 1meg. To insure that this 1meg remains available for
video if at all possible, it is defined by init as "colored" memory. The
highest res window, the one most likely used with GWin (768x480x16), eats
up 180K for the screen. All backing-store buffers should be allocated out
of normal memory.

 Right now, I'm picturing something a little more involved than a shell
script. Something more on the lines of SysGo/TSMon, without the restart
capability. It would grab a KWin "device", change it to the needed format,
open the GWin device, pass the needed info about the Kwin screen, fork off
the first GWin app, then wait. The reason for the fork/wait rather than a
chain is to keep the path to the Kwin device open so that the GWin drivers
can get keyboard data. This idea could be subject to minor revision as more
data becomes available. :>

 Actually, The MM/1-Kwindows uses both software and hardware for color
control. The MM/1 has a Brooktree palette controller, which the TC-70 did
not. This controller has 256 "slots", of which each can hold one of 16.7m
color choices. For the screen resolutions we'll be dealing with here, the
MM/1 uses the first 16 slots. To use any of these 16 slots, you store the
appropriate bit pattern in the video memory. This is totally software, and
KWin does not need to know about it. But, if you want to change the color
of a given slot (say the gif being viewed requires a really putrid green),
you'll need to reset the Brooktree. This is best done through Kwin. Kwin
reloads the Brooktree every screen change, and so would need to know the
palette you have chosen. If the GWin port uses only the default 16 colors,
then there is absolutely no problem.

 I agree that this shouldn't depend on hacks to the base GWin system, or patches

to KWin.  However, BlackHawk has stated that KWin is undergoing an upgrade
as we speak. Maybe a little cross-communication can minimize the problems
with the mouse and keyboard. It wouldn't take much, and most of the hoped-
for changes have been addressed in complaints about Kwin already.

 I think that it can be done, and won't be any more work than having to
write the drivers to totally replace KWin as the console.

    I can understand that, considering the situation, you would want to have
money in-hand before even starting the port, however, I find it hard to
juistify holding up $200 for a period of time estimated to be 2 to 3 months,
possibly longer, when there are a number of equally important products that
the money could be spent on with a much faster return.

    It would seem to me to be more reasonable to charge a non-refundable

once the port was finished.

Hi, Zack -

That's good... but does it now return an appropriate error if an application
tries to open a window when there is insufficient contiguous memory
remaining or any other error occurs?  (Of course, this needs to ripple
into cgfx.l, too.)  This is a real gotcha for K-Windows programmers.
Typical K-Windows screens require 66,560 (80x26x16) to 184,320 (96x60x16)
bytes in the 1-meg video memory area (1.5M with an unpublished hack), which
can quickly get used.

The limited number of window descriptors affected some design decisions
for KVed, so it is nice to see that limit increased, though.

BTW, does the latest 68340-Windio (V51?) restore the pushbuttons, so you
can use KVed now?

My thoughts at the time closely paralleled much of what you have been
proposing.  Though I didn't go into the details, what I had in mind (with
a few embellishments) was:

  - G-Windows init:
     - open a 768x480x16 K-Windows screen through a standard Kwin call (for
       /w).  It would keep the associated paths open.
     - GW would obtain screen video memory base address from KW
     - GW would use a KW call to set initial palettes.
     - GW would tell KW to turn off mouse cursor, as it would generate its
       own.
  - G-Windows term:
     - GW would close KW paths after terminating its own resources
  - Reading the mouse:
     - GW should probably use KW calls to read the mouse values, for
       co-existence. (Note that KW juggles which screen is currently active.)
       GW should honour Ms_Valid to ensure that it only reacts to mouse
       actions entered when it is the interactive screen.
     - KW normally only has one mouse button available for the application
       to use (default, the left one).  Since I sent my original messages,
       we have learned that with Scroll Lock "On", the center button
       (normally cut/paste) can also be used.  The right button switches
       to the next screen in rotation, so is useless to an application.
  - Reading the keyboard:
     - keyboard input would arrive to GW via the original KW stdin path.
     - KW keyboard idiosyncrasies/idiocies that will need to be addressed:
        - ALT-CTRL-A/B/Space
        - CTRL-ARROWs, CTRL-Enter, ALT-ARROWs, etc.
       The first group (move, resize) are particularly troublesome,
       especially the "move", which could be initiated from another screen
       to move it onto the GW screen.
  - Compatibility with KW applications:
     - programs requiring KW support (sound, different resolution screens,
       etc.) could be run from a GW window using:
               "application <>>>/w"
       which would automatically be routed by OSK to /w and Windio.
     - KW applications which automatically create a new KW screen should
       work as above.
     - KW applications which fiddle with the current screen to change its
       characteristics would not be directly compatible, but could be
       run using the "<>>>/w" method above.

Anyways, the above are really nothing much more than "ruminations"...
we really don't know what is feasible at this point.

It is going to be very interesting to see what approaches the two G-Windows
ports take...

Cheers... / Ken

Yes, all that info is available.  I would suggest, however, that instead
of examing the current screen address, that you open a new path to the
device "/w" which will select an open (unused) K-Window device
descriptor and then open to the appropritate resolution using a DWSet
call (just like the CoCo OS-9 DWSet call).  That would be best, I think.

There is no distinction between an "active" or "inactive" window as far
as writing to a K-Window is concerned.  All windows are always updated,
just not always visible.  The screen memory address you get is yours...
the window will not be moved.

The mouse should not be a problem under K-Windows...  K-Win is pretty
liberal in providing info about the mouse.  You will probably have to
request K-Windows turn off it's own mouse pointer, which is as easy as
sending two bytes to the screen.  The keyboard is what I'm most
concerned about.  Hitting CTRL-A will resize a screen...  CTRL-SPACE
will move a window to another location...  these are things you cannot
stop.  Your will can be moved by the user to a new location or resized
without your knowledge or control.  And those ctrl sequences are not
passed onto the application, either.

Mike,

After many years of COCO "windows", I too had concerns about a
Gwindows system.  It did not make that much differance!  I believe
that part of my reluctance is the unconscious comparisons I was
making to Microsoft "Windows".  That product does not really
multitask like Gwindows/OSK and that is a BIG differance!  Things
here go on rather smoothly in the other windows and inside of
hibernating icons.  It is not all that much of a change to "shoot"
at another window or at an icon to bring it up to the top.  It is
also easy to lay several windows alongside each other since they
can be resized and moved with the mouse.  I am not familiar
with K-windows.  Having the scroll bars, hibernate , close buttons, the
icons for hard drives and floppies, etc. is quite an improvement over
CoCo windows.  I am not sure if I would be so positive about
Gwindows if the resolutionof the screen was like the CoCo.  I believe
that the MM/1 has adequate resolution in some of its modes.  If
you have no access to a system with Gwindows, the closest
thing is the new Workplace shell in OS/2.1 ( Now, don't
pin me down on that--they are not TOO close)  Gwindows/OSK
is , in general, a lot faster on the Kix\30 than OS/2 on
a 486-25.

source code and had it hacked.  He on't be the last either.  The people that do
this are going to do it and release it without permission anyway.  Like any
other software that is "free" it will end up distributed all over the place.  I
know here on Delphi and on my own BBS this stuff will not make to the Databases
but it will on an awful lot of BBS's and stuff like this is passed around at

Anyway, I see no compelling reason to spend over $100.00 a year to connect to
CIS.  As far as GEnie?  Compelling reason #1. They have a CoCo Sig that is at
least as active as the one on CIS.  That would be enough reason IF I could

I agree that for some people $20/$30 a month per service may be viewed as a
reasonable expense.  I, however usually end up with more like $35/$45 a month
on Delphi alone.  This is due to the volume of mail I must store at times due
to my being an officer of three Users Groups.  That and the fact that I must
often log on during the day when I pay a premium rate.  I have had bills as
high as $250.00 just previous to the Fest and during The OS-9 Users Group
debacle.  I think anybody can see why I would hesitate to go online with CIS.
Other reasons include the fact that most people I need to interface with are
here or on Internet and the fact that Delphi is "home".
 NBC just discovered computer communications....shudder, shudder.!.

I was using the figures quoted for CIS.  I know that it would cost more but
don't want to get into an argument about how it "only costs me" and I've had
bills as low as, etc.  Suffice it to say that it ould be a minimum of $200.00

     MM/1 Joystick
     From: MREGC        To: ALL

    Making the MM/1 as compatible with CoCo hardware as possible was a
sensible idea, for the most part, but there is only so far that this should
have been carried. How is anyone who doesn't have an old CoCo joystick going
to use the MM/1's joystick port? These joystcks aren't sold anymore by anyone!

    I seem to remember that back in the days some company sold an adaptor to
make the CoCo 6-pin DIN joystick port accept traditional Atari type joystick
plugs. Does anyone know if the company and/or the product still exist?

    It won't make much sense to write siftware that uses a piece of next-to-
impossible to find equipment.

Well, it is a trivial task to adapt an IBM joystick to use on a CoCo so I would
think that it would be the same thing on the MM/1.  Moreover the Super Deluxe
Joystick for the Tandy 1000 line IS available from Rat shack and it is easy to
find the CoCo style Joysticks at Rat Sack.  Gravis also made a Joystick for the
Tandy 1000 that work just fine with a CoCo and even had instructions for the
CoCo.  I'm sure that BlackHawk could work out a deal with Gravis IF finding the
joysticks becomes a major problem.  BTW, the original "deluxe" joystick was the
made by Kraft.  Just a couple of trivial mods and a different connector on the
end.  There is a company that sells adapters to use Atari joysticks with the
CoCo as well...I disrememeber who it is right now.  Oh and last but not least,
That is a seven DIN connector on the back of the CoCo.

Carl,
    I hope getting joysticks is as easy as you make it out to be. I know some
company sold joystick adaptors way back when, but that was a long time ago.
Hopefully they are still in business or can at least be contacted.
    When you say you can still get CoCo style joysticks at Radio Shack, do you
mean by special order? I just checked out 1 Shack in my area to see if they had
any, and they didn't. But of course that was only one store. Was that not very

    That may well be true. However, the idea here is supposed to be to make
OSK, (or the MM/1 or whatever,) as *user* friendly as possible, which means
getting away from the old CoCo habit of hardware hacking our way into what we
need. I may be a programmer, but as far as hardwae goes, I'm as much of a user
as you can find. I don't touch hardware except for maybe jumpering a drive to
change its id in the chain of drives. I would in no way attempt to make an
adaptor to use an IBM joystick in a CoCo connector, *nor should I have to.*

    If we want to have mainstream appeal then our products *must* be plug-and-
go, which means either supplying all owners with the necessary equipment, or
making such things as adaptors included with the software that needs them. In
my opinion, the former would be much more desireble. As a programmer I don't
think I should have to worried about whether or not users will have access to
the right type of joystick or an adaptor to use a more mainstream one. And I
*certainly* shouldn't have to provide such an adaptor with every game I sell.

original message. My whole point was that the MM/1 uses joysticks that are no
longer in production, which is a bad design decision if we want to appal to
more than just the hardware hacker who doesn't mind having to "MAKE THE
CHANGES for it to work!" Users SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. That IS the whole
point! The nessage of mine which you replied to had NOTHING to do with the
CoCo.

  >If they get one from Radio Shack it will still have the 6 pin plug...

    That's certainly not what I saw when I visited my friendly neighborhood
shack the other day. All the joysticks there had connectors of the old Atari
style, (maybe that's the IBM style, I don't know as I'm not familiar with IBM
style joysticks.) Now I just have to visit several other shacks to see if
CoCo style joysticks are nowhere to be found.

    OK, for the third, (and hopefully last,) time. I was not referring to the
CoCo, but rather to the CoCo style joysticks which the MM/1 uses. And one of
the major points of what I'm saying is that MM/1 users *should not have to*
change, modify, adapt, or do anything else to another style of joystick just
to have a useable joystick for their MM/1.

WHOOPS!  blushing...  How right you are.  I just counted again.  Must have been
up too long when I counted yesterday.  I disagree about the "5pins" though.  I
have an old gray case and it has 6 pin output.  Are you thinking of the
connector on the M/Board or the one on the cable?  I know Tandy did make some
Tandy/custom cable connectors with a pin missing.  They never stop being the

While Tandy isn't "restocking the joystick" it is far from a "hard to find" or
off-the-list item.  The reason for this is the fact that until just VERY, very
recently the Tandy 1000 line used the same joystick.  If the store you deal
with doesn't have one on the shelf ask them to call a couple of local stores.
I was able to find 50 High Resolution interfaces that way at just 5 stores only
a year ago.  Since the joysticks MAY be discontinued (I'm not sure of that) you
can also ask them to check the disco sheet which will give quantitites and
locations within the district.  As I said Gravis also made a very nice stick
for the Tandy 1000 and the CoCo that was sold at Egghead.  I bought 2.  I'm
sure they would do a limited run for Blackhawk if there was a demand for them.

re: plug and go:
 Actually even in the IBM/PC world you will find that quite often you need a
gender changer or adapter to make something work.  Sure, if you buy a card to
plug into your computer that has an attachment it will not need anything else,
but if you buy a modem it comes with a cable (external) that is 25/25.  Your
computer has 9 pin.  Hm, what to do?  You aren't a hacker?  OK, you either buy
a cable that is 25 at one end and 9 at the other or a 25/9 adapter.  The same
thing would apply here.  What is needed is an adapter cord for the IBM type of
joystick.  No problem.  Just another item for some vendor to make and sell.  Of
course this is all problematic since there aren't any MM/1s in production yet
and I doubt that any changes are going to be introduced even if they do go into
production since that would cost additional $$ and that is something that I
doubt that Blackhawk can afford right now, especially for something this easy
to "fix".

Yes, it was mostly intended as a rhetorical question...  Probably it

Unfortunately, the DWSet call doesn't seem to return anything (based on docs

When we tried KVed on Brian White's MM/1A after the fest, we ran into two
major problems:
  - the Windio V50 palette bug, which I understand has been addressed in
    V51.
  - The K-Windows Pushbutton gadgets, which KVed uses for most of its
    main-screen buttons (not the overlays) refused to work.  (We also tried
    Joel's "Fest" Calculator program, which also uses Pushbuttons, and
    found it was broken, too.)  The problem is quite obvious, as it cripples
    mouse-activation for all of the main KVed functions.  If you didn't
    have a similar problem, maybe Brian had something installed wrong on
    his system.

Profibus and FIP are quite complex, kind of like TCP/IP
for process instruments.
Fibus may only communicate with certain Gespac I/O modules.
Industry in general is looking for a common protocol for
all types of instruments such as pressure, temperature, and
flow transmitters.  Add to that limit switches, pressure switches,
etc.  All of this will communicate on a twisted pair,
with high noise immunity, at 1 megabit or higher.  "I/O"
cards would not be needed anymore (in theory).

Well, it depends on what you define as theory.  Full RS-232 implementation is
rare.  (as defined by the standard)  Certain standards were proposed before a
product was even prototyped...IBM microchannel is an example.  As technology
speeds up and computer hardware changes magnify standards will be theoretical
in the future so that manufacturers can produce platforms that will be supported

by the third party vendors.

Thanks a bunch.  I didn't realize that linking files was that easy.
