Remember when I complained that rtn;ns didn't always work right?  I keep
forgetting to mention that I figured it out.  What happens is that if the first
message is long enough to want to pause, it asks for a CR and then complains
about an illegal command.  You type ns at the next prompt and it goes on.
Otherwise, rtn;ns seems to run non-stop like it used to.

Greetings All,
        Is any body aware of an OS9 development environment that provides
facilties similar to Turbo debugger on PC's. Such an environent would probably
be PC based using E-net to communicate with OS9 system a bit like remote
debugging under Turbo Debugger. Does such a thing exist or are we all stuck
with the OS9 resident terminal based debuggers (sigh)?

Any information gratefully received

Actually more busy with the new iron foundry instrument, but.....

The idea of a command line switch sounds interesting.  It should default to
off, so you have to be explicit unless you use the flag.  I was going to use
the tree walk code from tar, but it takes some major work to ar to make it
work.  Not sure I want to do that much.  I may look at lha (actually, I don't
think I ever got lha from you) but it may not be any better.  The problem is
more in ar.  Course, soon as I say that someont will show me how easy it is B-\
It is easier to handle the binary file compression problem.  I was worried
about adding too much code, but I guess I get 16K - 512 bytes before it takes
another page on the coco, so maybe I can do it.  The OSK version runs, but the
problem one is the coco version, so that needs to settle out first.  I suspect
ar has outlived it's usefulness for OSK, though, with all the other options
available. OTOH, at 15 or 16 bits it might be close enough to zoo/lha/etc in
size and enough faster to make it the choice.  Dunno at this point.  Thanks for
the advice!  Carl

There may be other/better choices for compression under OSK, but we still need
a way to unAr those CoCo achives on our OSK machines!  :-)

I guess I meant mainly putting lots of effort into ar for OSK, vs keeping for
bursting old archives.  Although it is both faster and smaller than zoo and 1/3
the time of lha although the file size was half again bigger. Ummm that is a
bit confusing.  Ar made a smaller file in less time than zoo.  But lha made a
file 2/3 the size ar did, but took 3 times longer.

Hi Carl,

Just back from vacation so I am getting a late start with ar2 beta testing.
Actually, not much testing; I can't get it to work. Tried it on several
different text files, all with exactly the same results, for example:

   ar2 -u mail mail
   archiving <mail>
   ar2: Can't get memory
   ERROR 216

Or, if I give the complete filename:

   ar2 -u mail.ar mail
   archiving <mail>
   ar2: Can't get memory
   ERROR 248

I did the tests using a ramdisk, then repeated them with source on the ramdisk
and destination on a floppy; same results.

Looking forward to seeing a working version soon. If you need any more details
or detective work, let me know and I will try to characterize it better.

Ian

Carl,

OK, I tried using 12 bits (which, by the way, the help screen says is the
default) and it works fine, but produces results essentially identical to the
old version of ar. Didn't try timing it since I was only doing short files.

I tried running without the ramdisk with no change. I had about 400K free at
the time, so can't see that memory should be a problem. I see that I'm not the
only CoCo user having similar problems; hope you can track it down. For me, the
 "delete" function is a great addition; I have wanted it many times and am quite
used to it with PKZIP at work. Move is also very useful, and compressing
binaries should help too.

Will download the latest beta version as soon as it is posted.

I don't know what the problem is there.  It works fine here.  Loading the
function keys is pretty straight forward.  Try running code and hitting your Fn
key and see if they match what you 'think' you set them too.  Try it in the
startup file, then re-load it from the command line and try code again.  This
is how I've checked to make sure.

The Philips CD-I 910 Player has been available since Oct '91.  The price has
been lowered to about $399 on the street.  It is available from Sears as well
as other Electronics stores.  There are over 100 titles available (games,
educational, informational etc.).  The Philips CD-I players will play CD-DA
(regular audio CD's) CD+G (simple graphic audio CD's) and Kodak Photo CDs as
well as the CD-I titles.
The player is controller with an infrared joystick controller (or optional
trackball etc.)

Internally the box has:
* 68070 at 15 Mhz,
* 1MB RAM (divided into two 512K video planes)
* Video chip which provides two planes of overlayed graphics is several modes
(128 or 256 colors out of 16M, 32768 true color and DYUV photo realistic mode.)
*  8KB non-volitile RAM (for highs scores saves etc.)
*  OS-9 68K in ROM with CD-RTOS extensions (CD-Real Time Operating System)
*  An expansion slot (for which Philips is releaseing a Digital Video card this
October (~$250) which will provide 1.5MB additional RAM and a MPEG-1
audio/video decoder - This will provide better than VHS quality video with CD
quality soundtrack to be played from the CD! - (I have a development board at
work and it is really impressive, great quality from a 170Kps CD achieving over
150:1 compression).  BTW the new CD White Book ('karakoke') standard is
compatible with CD-I Digital Video so many video and movies will be available
(Paramount has already committed to 50 titles!)

A am a software engineer for Philips Interactive Media (POV) which is the
Philips company who develops and distributes software for CD-I.

A far as using a consumer CD-I player for a OS-9 computer, I don't think you
would like it.  The only I/O is one serial port that could be hooked to a
terminal and you would need all OS-9 programs/utilities (such as a shell) you
wished to run burned on a disc (unless you wanted to make your own hardware).

Philips has a development version of the player which is more realistic with
5MB RAM a SCSI port a 1.44 floppy and a Ethernet port.  But this costs (I
think) >$3000.

About OS-9, I am sorry to report that it dosen't make a very good real-time
operating system (in fact I don't belive it has the needed features to merit
the name Real Time Operating System). - Don't get me wrong OS-9 works fine, I
just wasn't designed to handle truly real time tasks.

I know that the chip sets in the consumer model and the professional
development player are virtually identical, it might be possible to get it to
believe it is a development system if the ROM sockets are the same. I am not so
sure that the 605 (the development model) is $3000, let me see if I can find
out a price.

Bob,
I am not familiar with the specifics of the mm/1, but to make it run CD-I discs
would probably be very difficult.
  For hardware you would need a dual plane video chip (supporting all special
CD-I modes), a XA-type CD drive, an ADPCM audio decoder.
  The software is the big problem.  You would have to write a whole bunch of
managers and drivers to the CD-I spec.

At close to $300 it would doubtless be cheaper to buy a consumer CD-I player.

Just thought I'd pass along an interesting bug I found in the GCC2 package! If
you compile the following program with 'gcc2 -O2  test.c -o /dd/cmds/test' it
will not work properly. However, deleting the '-O2' from the compile line fixes
it. It appears that the optimization internal to CC2 is broken. Also, if you
change the declaraction of 'c' to 'unsigned char' it appears to work okay too.
An exlicit cast in the 't=...' line doesn't help. So, until this is fixed,
you'd best not use the -O option. Would someone familiar with the GNU project
pass this report along to someone who can fix it? BTW, the version of cc2 on my
machines is 'GNU C version 2.4.1 (68k, Motorola syntax)'.

char  *command_line;
{
  char *args[4];
  int  pid;

  args[0] = "shell";
  args[1] = "ex";
  args[2] = command_line;

  if ((pid = os9exec(os9forkc,args[0],args,environ,0,0,3)) == -1) {
      printf("fork failed\n");
      return(-1);
  } else
      return (wait(pid));
}

I thought that this was actually killing the shell and allowing the command
line to return an error code, but this doesn't seem to be the case.  popen.c
uses code much like this too.  The problem with it is that the os9exec()
never returns -1 unless the shell can't be forked for some reason.  And never
ever depends on the actual command line.

So, what's the real story with ex?

Mike, I would have guessed the same thing...ex means don't have a shell run
this program, but don't leave the shell to come back to. This means that shell
can do the command line stuff for you (like pipes, and redirect). I sortof
assume that a chain() instead of a fork() is done (but that is a real guess).
Umm, to be sure, have you tried to fork a program with the ex and then switch
windows and do a procs...that should let you know what is active.

Yup, I've checked in the other window, guess what a shell!! This is where my
confusion comes in.  I don't understand how a popen() can fail if the shell is
always available.  But I sure can see the problems that it creates. :-(

Any other ideas?

Might be something with the way popen() works. If I just do something like 'ex
ved myfile' from an existing shell...the shell goes away. So, it appears that
ex affect the current shell...but if popen() is forking a shell...damned if I
know. Hmmm, what happens if you take the 'ex' out of the popen code? Do you end
up with 2 shells?

If I take the 'ex' out, it works the same way. Hmm...  If I take the shell and
ex both out, it works as expected.  Pretty unusual if you ask me.  This is OK,
but you can't fork a basic program or a shell script this way.  (That's the
reason for the shell).

Mark,
   Have you been able to find any WD33C93 SCSI chips for the MM/1? I still need
the chip on my I/O board replaced.

Thanks,

No, I haven't.  Paul Ward was supposed to send me what he had, but that comment
was made several months ago and I haven't heard anything from him since then.
I haven't tried calling around to all the chip distributors to see if they have
any with the older masks.  Seems like we all is stuck. You might try calling
Western Digital and see if they can help you.

Our QT 20x uses the WD33C93 SCSI chip. I ended up faxing a request for these
specific chips to every "surplus" electronics place that I could find. Out of
20 or so requests I got two responses but I did find a few chips.

I suggest you guys start doing the same ASAP if you ever want to find any.

I just had a visit from some suppliers today, and they mentioned that AMD makes
a WD33C93A clone... altho the DIP package version was getting hard to obtain.
Dunno if it is an exact clone or not yet, but they're sending me a sample.

Well, I hope that it works! WD's latest version of their own chip was different
as we all know, so I wouldn't get my hopes up too high. But I DO hope that the
AMD part works!

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: All

I've got an interesting little assembler problem here. I downloaded Russ
Magee's SpAmTRACKER program from another service. It came with assembler
source. The first two lines in the source were:

 use <oskdefs.d>
 use    <funcs.a>

First problem I had was that I got re-defined errors...so I commented out
Read_, etc. in oskdefs.d. That allowed r68 to create the .r file. However, when
I tried to link I got an error. I tried using rdump on the file and it couldn't
 process the entire .r file.

I finally got the sucker to work by taking out the 'use <funcs.a>' and linking
with sys.l. Have I got some incompatible files? Or what?

Bob,
I think that funcs.a is for stand-alone programs (not linked with sys.l etc.).
The OS-9 magic trap numbers are stored as constants in the sys.l and resolved
by the linker (hence re-defined errors when sys.l and funcs.a are used).

Ken, you're right about not using funcs.a if you are going to link with sys.l.
However, the problem I ran into was that the ROF created when funcs.a was
inlcuded with the mainline psect was somehow corrupted. I just did a quick test
with a 2 line asm program and included funcs.a in the file. Doing a rdump of
the ROF results in a error message...something about not a ROF. Not a big deal
for me (I use mostly C). Besides, one shouldn't use funcs.a anyway...but the
source I received did it that way and I was just trying to get it to run.
