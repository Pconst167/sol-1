Does anyone know if a normal PC-type keyboard will work with a Televideo 965
terminal. I have a term. with a blown keyboard (I think). I thought I'd make up
a little converter cable to switch from a DIN plug to the telephone jack the
TV-965 uses. But if someone has more knowledge than me let me know if I'm
wasting my time (or if I can damage the PC keyboard... even though I have
checked voltages and it appears to be just 5volt).

  b) Take address of interesting element
  c) Subtract a) from b)
  d) Assign result to a variable

Pete,

I hadn't thought of that one, but like Bob's suggestion, it is a runtime
method, which I wanted to avoid. The simplest runtime solution, in this
particular case, is to assign the address of each element to an array of
pointers. I was hoping there was some way to initialize variables to the
offsets at compile time. I could do it with #asm, I think, but really didn't
want to. I think I'll just leave it like it is, which is all runtime type
stuff. The purpose of this was to reduce the size of the code, since I'm having
great fun trying to pack a lot of program into 48K, or 40K in some cases, for
the CoCo. What is one OSK module is now four OS9 modules, and I think I'm going
to have to go to five.

Bill, I don't want to get into any arguments here...but both my and Pete's
suggestions were compile time. Uh, maybe you should upload a snippet of code so
we can be sure we're all talking about the same thing...

BTW, is this for your auto-cis program? How's it coming?

Bob,

Yes its for the auto-CIS (auto-Delphi, too) program, which is called InfoXpress
(IX for short). IX is coming along, but slowly. I had thought I would have more
free time to work on it, which just hasn't happened. I was hoping to have a
shareware version available for the CoCo by now. The biggest stumbling block
with the CoCo is the 64K per process limitation, but so far I've managed.

I went back and looked at your suggestion, and you're right, it is compile
time. But when I apply your suggestion to my problem, I end up with run time
code because I'm dealing with pointers to structures that are passed from other
functions. I could copy the passed structure to a local structure and use your
suggestion (I hadn't thought of that until just now).

Pete's suggestion can actually be interpreted as either compile time or run
time, and again, in this particular situation it would be run time.

After asking the question, and further thought on a solution, I think I've
decided to leave it as it is, it will be easier to maintain, and since the
functions involved save and load the configuration file for IX, I expect the
code is going to change frequently.

Here is the classical method of finding a struct element offset, if this

#define offsetof(t, m)  (&(((t *)0)->m))

typedef struct {

    int     b;
    short   c;

I've uploaded two files to DL12 in the last couple of days. The first is docs

out what files to include so that the unix source would compile properly. This
program will melt the newer PK-ZIP files which the existing unzip on this
system will not. It also melts files into subdirectories and keeps file dates
accurate. However, it insists on processing everything in all lowercase (unless
you like uppercase filenames), so I wrote a little program to convert directory
names to all uppercase. Look for the files "unzip.lzh" and "updir.c" in DL12.

Just wanted you all to know that I received my copy of CoCo-C the other day.
This is a C compiler for RS_DOS Coco1/2/3. It is quite complete implementation
(integer only). It features a separate compiler (to assembler), assembler and
linker. The supplied library contains most of the common C functions plus calls
to interface with the Basic ROMS.

The Docs are about 100 8x11 pages in a bound manual. Quite complete, but does
assume you have some C programming knowledge.

I do have an interest in the success of this product--they have licensed my
editors which are included in the package.

For the price, I think it's an excellent offer. According to the ad in Rainbow,
it costs $59.95 + 4.00 s/h. For more info contact:

The most used programming language in the OSK community is 'C'. In general 'C'
is an accepted language in embedded system, real time systems and the like. As
far as application programs, most likely 'C' or even Pascal. I believe the
ORIGINAL (CP/M) version of WordStar was written in assembly language on the
Z80/8080 microprocessors, but it was much easier to program in assy lang in
those days when one could brag about having a system with 64k and TWO eight
inch disk drives. The WordStar for CP/M was about 38k long.

        Today, big projects like WordPerfect or Paradox and other IBM
application software take a tremendous time, number of people, and money. One
person may work just on one certain part of the project.

the 'C' language is very popular among IBM users, although IBM users have a
wider range of choices of languages than OSK users, such as QBasic. QBasic is a
BASIC language compiler made by Microsoft, the original maker of MBASIC for IBM
and MS-DOS systems.
        While I could not swear to it, I would think WordPerfect would probably
be written under something like 'C' or Pascal. Even though WordPerfect
theoretically could be written under QBasic since QBasic does make an
executable (.EXE).

There used to be a product called CoCoUtil that ran on an MS-DOS machine and
would
 read, write and even format standard RS-DOS-type disks (single-sided
35-track).

I think Clearbrook Software Group had a set of MS-Dos Utilities, too.  They
used to advertise in Rainbow.  Their Utility would actually supported
OS9-->MS-DOS and viceversa transfers.  However, I think their utilities ran
under OS-9.


Seems like I saw an advertiser in Rainbow (recently) that is selling an
MS-DOS-based transfer utility, too, but I don't think it mentioned transfers to
or from OS-9.  Seems like it was OwlWare's ad, if you're willing to take a

hello keith

the reason why your SETENV stuff only work in .login, is because your 'startup'
is run by a 'shell' forked by 'sysgo'. This shell dies after having 'executet'
the startup-file. If you want to set up ENV-variables from the shell you talk
to after startup has run, you need to modify your sysgo.a to setup parameters
for the final 'shell' forked. Let me know if you need some example-code !!

Ole and Keith: as an alternate to changing sysgo you can just use the builtin
shell command 'profile'. I have a line in my startup (right near the start):

        profile .login

this (apparently) reads the .login file and sets the variables for the parent
of the shell which is running startup. For some reason the profile command is
not documented (or I can't find it in the manual).

Not sure if Mshell supports this construct, but in Bourne and Korn shells, the
line '. .profile' (or more portably, '. $HOME/.profile' will read and execute

   Topic:  How to Shoot Yourself in the Foot
  Author:   harles Forsythe
    Date:  04:09 Today

C: You shoot yourself in the foot.

C++: You accidentally create a dozen instances of yourself and shoot them all
in the foot. Providing emergency medical assistance is impossible since you
can't tell which are bitwise copies and which are just pointing at others and
saying, "That's me, over there."

FORTRAN: You shoot yourself in each toe, iteratively, until you run our of
toes, then you read in the next foot and repeat. If you run out of bullets, you
continue anyway because you have no exception-handling facility.

Modula-2: After realizing that you can't actually accomplish anything in this
language, you shoot yourself in the head.

COBOL: USEing a COLT 45 HANDGUN, AIM gun at LEFT.FOOT, THEN place
ARM.HAND.FINGER on HANDGUN.TRIGGER and SQUEEZE. THEN return HANDGUN to HOLSTER.
CHECK whether shoelace needs to be retied.

LISP: You shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with which you
shoot yourself in the appendage which holds the gun with which you shoot
yourself in the appendaga which holds...

BASIC: Shoot yourself in the foot with a water pistol. On big systems, continue
until entire lower body is waterlogged.

FORTH: Foot in yourself shoot.

APL: You shoot yourself in the foot, then spend all day figuring out how to do
it in fewer characters.

Pascal: The compiler won't let you shoot yourself in the foot.

SNOBOL: If you succeed, shoot yourself in the left foot. If you fail, shoot
yourself in the right foot.

HyperTalk: Put the first bullet of the gun into the foot left of leg of you.
Answer the result.

Prolog: You tell your program you want to be shot in the foot. The program
figures out how to do it, but the syntax doesn't allow it to explain.

370 JCL: You send your foot down to MIS with a 4000-page document explaining
how you want it to be shot. Three years later, your foot comes back deep-fried.

        Programmer's Night before Crisis

 'Twas the night before crisis and all through the house,
 Not a program was working, not even a browse.

 The programmers were wrung out, too mindless to care,
 Knowing chances of cutover hadn't a prayer.

 The users were nestled all snug in their beds,
 While visions of inquiries danced in their heads.

 When out in the lobby there arose such a chatter,
 I sprang from my tube to see what was the matter.

 And what to my wondering eyes should appear,
 But a Super Programmer, oblivious to fear.

 More rapid than eagles, his programs they came,
 And he whistled and shouted and called them by name;

 "On Update!  On Add!  On Inquiry!  On Delete!"
 "On Batch Jobs!  On Closing!  On Functions Complete!"

 His eyes were glazed over, his fingers were lean,
 From weekends and nirhts in front of the screen.

 A wink of his eye, and twist of his head,
 Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

 He spoke not a word but went straight to work,
 Turning specs into code, then turned with a jerk.

 He sighed as he pressed the big ENTER key,
 The system came up and worked perfectly.

 The updates updated, the deletes deleted,
 Inquiries inquired, and the closing completed.

 He tested each whistle and tested each bell,
 With nary an abend, all had gone well.

 The system was finished, the tests were concluded,
 The users' last changes were even included.

 And the user exclaimed with a snarl and a taunt,
 "It's just what I asked for, but not what I want!"

Bob,
   Either that,(no one has any problems), or everyone went away for the
holidays. I hope it is something like that.
   While I have your attension, do you know anything about writing screen print
drivers. I have a Deskjet 550c sitting here just aching for a driver.
   It prints text files just great, but I would sure like to print some of
these pictures on the MM/1. I sent off to HP for the technical reference
manual, because the manuals that came with it told nothing about how to send
the data that the printer needs to do color printing. It came with a couple of
disks of drivers, but these are for ms-dos, which does me no good at all.
   I have no idea on how to write a driver, but I'm going to look into it.

Larry, guess it's up to us to keep the traffic here up <grin>.

Grafix drivers for printers are pretty application specific. I have written a
few screen dump routines for dumping coco screens to an Epson printer. However,
I believe that the Deskjet works much like a laser in this regard and you have
to send it one line of data at a time. I spent some time reading a tech manual
for a laser printer and it appeared that one just had to send the raster data
along with some control codes. It didn't look all the complex, but then I
didn't have access to the printer so didn't have to find out how "easy" it
really is.

I think that what you want to write is not a driver but a screen print
program...quite different. The drivers supplied with your printer are most
likely interfaces for specific ms-dos application programs.

How do you like the deskjet? I considered buying one awhile ago, but was
disappointed by the resolution. Of course, in the stores demoing them they just
used cheap photocopy paper and appologized for the poor quality and assured me
that with proper paper the resolution was excellent. But I wanted to see for
myself and I guess they weren't all that interested in making a sale...

Bob,
   You are right, what I meant was a screen print routine. The printer works
great on text copy right out of the box. I will through together a little setup
program that will allow setting different text styles and sizes. That shouldn't
be a problem. I bought a copy of Vprint, but I havn't checked yet about setting
Vprint enviroment up for using some of the printer features.
  I guess the stumbling block I see for a screen print routine is trying to
figure out the correct code to send to the printer, when you get a pixel color
and want to have the printer put the same color on paper. The computer uses RGB
values while the printer uses CMY or CMYK. Its going to take some digging on
this, right now I don't have a clue.
  As far as the print quality, from what I have seen, for text the quality is
as good as a laser printer. The paper used does make a big difference, the
regular photo copy paper is perfectly usable, but if you want the very sharpest
characters,you might need to buy the paper that HP sellls. I picked up some
erasable typing paper and tried it and it comes out beautiful when I ran the
test routine that printed out all the different character styles and sizes. The
only problem with this paper is that it is too thin, you can see through it.
The problem with regular paper is that the ink has a tendency to spread as it
soaks into the paper, but if you use some kind of coated paper, the ink won't
soak in and spread.
   I don't know how long ago you looked at the Deskjet, but this new one, 550c,
has a separate black ink cartridge as well as the color cartridge, which gives
you black printing instead of the dark green they got when they were just
mixing the colors to get black in the earlier models.
   I need to finish up this other program I have been working on, before I
tackle any kind of screen print program, so when I do get heavy into it you can
expect to see alot of dumb questions I'll be sure to be asking.

Larry: Do send me a copy of your vprint init file when you have it done!

To complicate figuring out colors for the screen dump _you_ are going to write,
remember that the palettes for the screen can all be changed and then you have
no idea at all of the actual colors <grin>.

I understand that the paper HP sells is very expensive, But I don't know for
sure...maybe that is why all the demos are on cheap paper.

BTW, what kind of $$ is the 550c?

Bob,
    I havn't checked yet on the price for the HP paper but my guess is that it
is high. They give you some sample Glossy paper, Cutsheet paper and
Transparency film., 5 sheets of each. I havn't tried them yet, but the cut
sheet paper is about the weight of photocopy paper, the glossy paper is almost
like photographic paper, and must be expensive.
   The cost was around $650, I'm not sure what the going price is, this was
part of some other stuff that was bought, plus they had them on sale at the
time, plus I had some percentage off coupons.
   I will send you any VPRINT init file I come up with, I just got the manual
out and noticed that I never sent the registration paper in. I'm really bad
about that.
   The problem with the palette colors, I don't even want to think about
yet.<grin.
   There may be some help with the color conversions, I was reading an old
Compuserve newsletter, and they mentioned that there is a Hewlett Packard forum
on Compuserve. I havn't gone over there yet to check on it, but there may be
some help there.

I don't know about the 500c, but the 500 can use expensive or cheap paper.

I've use a pretty wide variety, and it all seems to do pretty good.

Paper that's specifically for laser printer does really good, but it's at the
high end of the price range from what I've seen.  Regular copier paper seems to
do very well, too, and it's much cheaper.

Lee,
   I'm always interested in saving time<g>. I started going through some of the
Deskjet init files that came with VPrint, and found myself very quickly lost.
This printer has so many options, which ones do you put in the init file. I
still have to spend some more time with the technical manual to figure out what
these commands do and how they innteract with each other.

There's probably more options available on the 500C, but the 500 has quite a
powerful command set.  I usually start with ones that I believe that I'll most
likely use.  Ranking them from most often used to least often used.  However,
if a less used option is especially powerful and convenient then it may get
bumped up on the list.

    I have a 550c here, the one with 2 cartridges, 1 for color and a second
with black ink.
    Part of the problem is that I don't have any major document printing jobs
right now, its been strickly program listings for the program I'm working on,
and some simple printing jobs.
    I will probably just slowly build the init file as I find that I need more
commands, like you mentioned.

I recently bought a HP Deskjet 500 (no color).

I like it.  I bought the FX-80 Emulation cartridge that's mentioned in the back
of the User's Manual.  By using the emulation cartridge I haven't had to find
or develop new drivers.  I've used MVCanvas to dump existing .VEF pictures
using its Epson print driver.
   One drawback from using the emulation cartridge is that there's not
"pass-thru" capability. Once it's in emulation mode that's where it stays.  You
can't access the native features by using some sort of special pass-thru
sequence that will cause the emulation cartridge to be by-passed.  Ergo,
there's no way, that I've found anyway, to do the landscape printing that is
supported in the native (non-emulated) mode.

As for quality and quietness, the DeskJet 500 is great.  It's hard to tell the
difference between it an laser quality.  It's pretty speedy, too.

I got mine at BizMart for $349 + tax.  The Emulation cartridge was an extra
$79.  I had to mail-order it, but it came very quickly.

Ahhh!  That is good news! Carl will do his usual good job as always.

As far as the design questions ... I'll leave that to those more qualified that

to use 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 results in all 4 users seeing the same mail.

Have I misunderstood something here? I should be able to establish different
groups, with unique user id's within, jes? Or perhaps, have I missed something
in the setup of mail?

I'd be interested in any comments from other mail users.

Thanks!

Uh, Steve...don't know about the mail program. But do you have group and user
mixed up. 0.0 is user 0, group 0; 2.0 is the same user. My understanding is
that all users with the same group have equal access. Hence, user 3.4 and 3.2
can read the same files... maybe some sage can explain the logic of this.

Hi Bob .. thanks for the reply!

Your understanding of the Group/User relationship is the same as mine. First
number is the Group, second is the User. And you're correct .. my problem is so
counter to the philosphy of OS9/OSK the error, most likely, is mine. But I'll
be darned if I can find it!

When I originally set up the MM/1, I applied this logic to the assignment of
password file entries. I was defined as 0.0, of course, and all other users
were established as 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and so on. Th idea being that any user
could establish other users in their group that could easily share material
between themselves.

But ... when I installed Microware's Mail, I quickly found out that it was
treating mail sent by all my users as mail being sent by me (0.0). Furthermore,
any mail I had in _my_ mail box was visible to _all_ my users.

Changing their Grp/Uid entry to 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, and so on, cured this
problem ... but left me with another. How do I take advantage of the GROUP
feature?

I'm hoping someone from Microware will see this and toss out a couple of ideas
for me to try.

Thanks!

The numbers in the Microware Mail Mail.sys file are the user numbers from the
password file, do not enter the group numbers from the password file.

This way the same user (.uu) with always get their mail no matter what group
they are logged in as. Put another way, each user on the system should always
have a unique user number (.uu) but may appear in a number of groups (gg1.uu,
gg2.uu, etc.).

The mail system has no way of dealing with the group numbers as assigned in the
password file.

You can set up groups (lists) for mailing purposes ONLY in the mail.sys file,
this is documented in that file.



This might be easier to explain via voice?

So what you're telling me is this is a _feature_ .. not a bug?

I'm aware of the operation of 'group list' and 'nickname' list. That's fine for
mass mailing ... but my problem manifests itself in attempting to make use of
an OSK standard ... Group/UID for user identification.

Seem to be a problem to me ... but then ....

Yeah, well, I thought it was a bug/problem as well but MW explained it to me as
a FEATURE!

From their point of view, the UID should always be unique for an individual.
That way the same person can be in many groups and still have the same UID.
This way their mail software can find you no matter what group you log in under
and you don't have to log in a bunch of times under different groups just to
get all of your mail. It does make sense if you think of it this way.

Hey Folks! 1)    Who has _any_ version of source-code to a program that will
ZIP files as well as unzip them?  Does anybody have working binaries for an
OSK-ZIP program ("compatible" with MeSsy-DOS' PKZip programs)? I've accepted
the offer of a loan on an XT (which I don't want) so I can create ZIPfiles of
straight-ASCII texts for an organization/BBS which absolutely refuses *.LZH
uploads.  I'd MUCH rather do it on my MM/1.
    (Actually, I'd rather stick with LHA/*.lzh, but the folks I'm working with
insist on being "compatible" and "mainstream". Arrgh!) - 2)    Who has source
code (or OSK binaries!) for a QWK-mail-reader? (especially one with TAGLINES!)
- 3)    When are we going to have a publicly released Usenet newsreader and
uucp* set of programs for OSK? - 4)    Do wo have available the routines that
would allow an OSK machine to
        a) use MNP, V.32, V.42 error correction and
        b) auto-fallback for calling or answering to a modem with a
                lower baud-rate? - 5)    Do we have a program that will "type"
a textfile at 10cps or so into a messagebase that otherwise barfs at full-speed
ASCII uploads?
      (I had a patience-exercising-experience trying to ASCII-upload this
message into the Atlanta Computer Society BBS {404/636-2991} MM/1_Tech-Echo
area. My second attempt at 300 baud worked.) - 6)    Who has the PCFile Manager
working on an MM/1, and HOW does one get it working? -
    This inquiring mind wants to know! -

Can't answer all the ??s...but

1 - I do have source for a PKZIP unzipper. I guess you might be able to reverse
engineer it to do packing...send me email if you want this and we can arrange
to get a disk to you. I have posted a binary to lib 12 which appears to work.

3 - what's the problem with MNP v32? I have a modem doing all this and run it
though sterm. No problems.

6 - the pcf file manager works fine on my mm/1. Do you have the latest editions
of the disk drivers, etc. (I believe you need edition #4 to use pcf). It's just
a matter of making sure that pcf and the nesc. descriptors are in memory. I
just load mine when needed.

need to do hardware handshaking (RTS/CTS) for best results. Xmode /t3 type=80
does this nicely with the new drivers/descrptors available in LIB 12.

There are a few different UUCP packages and NetNews systems available for
OSK among them are CNews and Rick Adam's news software that comes with his
UUCP package.

Check the UNIX forum for source to QWK-mail-readers, I don't know of any
binaries for OSK.

As for ZIP, we do have an Un-Zipper, but no-one has attempted porting the
UNIX Zipper as far as I know.  (Maybe I should look into ZIP for OSK!)

For your slow ASCII uploads, I think there is source for a program called
slowio that will do the trick, if not, it's pretty trivial to write one:

main()       
{
    char c;     
 
    while (c = getc(stdin)) != EOF) {
         putc(c,stdout);
    }
}

call it from the command line like:

slowio <file >/tx

Hope this helps,

PS there is RN for OSK too.

Yeah, but...

For most folks, who already complain that they see the "News Flash" bulletin
too often, having a list of a lot of files that they're not interested in would
only make their online session less friendly.

After all, the single command:

   BRO/LIB:ALL/AGE:x

would display the new files in every library for "x" days, and can easily be
added to a macro.

To impose mandatory-read thingies on people has been demonstrated time and time
again to be counterproductive.  Believe me.. I've fought that battle a long,
long, long time ago and lost.

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: All

I was fooling around earlier with different disk formats and figured some of
you might be interested in the results. This is on an mm/1 using ed #4 of
rb36c65.

 sector size      256         512        1024
 sct/track         36          21          11
 ileave             2           2           2
 trans. rate     18.6        21.6       23.02   meg/sec (read, write slower)

 disk cap.       1440        1680        1760   kilobytes

You might note that using 1024 byte sectors you get a total storage appx. 33%
greater than the 33 sector/track standard of the mm/1. Some cautions: you may
not be able to exchange disks with other users (or even different disk drives)
if you use the above formats and using a larger sector size means that more
space may be lost with small files.

Timing were done with Mark Griffith's 'ddtest' program.

However, you may want to consider this for 'fsave' and 'lha' type backups of
hard drives, etc.

Hi there... I've got a bit of an odd request. :^)

I'm an Amiga user; 68040 based machine, you may (or may not) be familiar with
it.

A favorite processor of mine has always been the 6809; I used to own various
bus level systems, and I've designed a few into machines myself - done just
tons of ASM programming for the '09, too.

Well, one of my little projects has been to create a 6809 emulator - and as of
this morning, it seems to be up and running 100%.

The environment is simple - the '09 memory space, rom emulation, ram emulation
and very limited device emulation (a 6850 ACIA to be precise). That's enough to
do many things, among which are run flex or OS-9, given a system monitor and
disk hardware emulation. I'm up to the emulation - what I'm looking for is a
copy of Psymon or some other '09 monitor - I've got it running "Assist09", the
monitor in the Motorola manual, just fine, but frankly, it stinks. :^)

So, anyone have any ideas?

    Just back from a Vegas Consumer Electronics Show that was very interesting
(and somewhat disturbing.)

    Conspicuous by their absence was Philips, with CD-I. Surprising, at least
to me, since they've actually started promoting it in tv ads yet they don't
show up to the first, and probably the biggest trade show of the year.

    This bodes especially badly since one of the biggest displays at the show
was Panasonic, which has joined forces with a company whose name escapes me, to
produce a product called, if memory serves me correctly, 3D-O. Basically 3D-O
is, well ... CD-I. It basically has everything that CD-I does, except that it
uses a 32 bit RISC processor made by a company that I've never heard of, and it
doesn't (at least I don't think) use our favorite Op Sys. Its got expansion
ports on it for *possible* future expansion into a computer. And Panasonic
seems to be pretty strong in support of it as they have already contracted with
over 60 software companies to produce CD titles for it.

    Probably the most discouraging thing about the show was seeing the
incredible detail, work, and quality that are apparent in the upcoming crop of
computer and CD games and software products. Disturbing because it became
apparent to me that the single, or even dou or trio of programmers can't hope
to produce anything competive with, or even remotely interesting in comparison
with the stuff being brought out by the big companies with teams of
programmers. Make no doubt about it, the stuff coming out on CD in the next
year is unbelieveable.

..Eric...

P.S. As an aside, at least somebody out there is using CD-I. I just today
discovered that the Ramada Reservation Center (where I work) is using a Philips
CD-I player to familiarize its agents with the hotels they're selling. Go
Ramada!

David, I finally got around to printing a copy of the termcap file you
uploaded. I notice that some of the entries have a (G), * or ** (and
combinations) appended to the end of the line. Ummm, what does this mean?

BTW, this is really very comprehensive. Seems to cover printers and modems as
well as some pretty fancy terminals.
