You could ask the c compiler to generate the assembler code and then just
optimize
that code. Much easier than manually convertinng to ASM

There is a simple hardware hack that will eliminate the problem. If you are
interested I will post. Since off hand I do not remember the pins to jumper. It
requires two jumpers on the back of the MM1 processor board.

Eliminate which problem? The keyboard apparently generating spurious characters
during disk access? Or the serial port dropping characters? I'm with Mark, now,
that most of the dropped characters are due to screen updates, maybe we can all
gang up on KD? <grin>

Bob  you should probably set the transfer count to a lower number. You can use
dmode on your hard disk descriptor when you want to do data com. The parameter
to change is maxcount. What happens is that the fast hard disks monopolize the
68070 bus and cause the lost characters. If you have a padle board you might
want to use t3 for modem use as it has a 4 character buffer built into the
duart. That could reduce the problems. If you need a paddle board let me know.
I may be able to sell you one.

 After fooling with the file a bit, I'm deciding that simply setting the UNIX
flag is not enough. Running a compile through to the assembly source on the
coco yields a four line file! With so many versions of UNIX running out there,
which one for flag setting purposes might be closest to OS9?
 The header file unzip.h makes allowances for everthing from a Cray computer to
an Amiga. Just how different are SUN and GCC UNIX? MINIX is also mentioned.
  My orginal strategy was to simply define it for UNIX and then #include all
the coco headers just to see if it would compile.
  It is starting to look [ into the future ] like a new computer will be forced
simply to maintain compatability with mundane utilities! How frustrating it is
to have perfectly functional equipment [obsolete] which is paid for, and not be
able to maintain simple compatability? It makes one want to rush off to
programming school as if there were time for such activities.
 I've noticed that the current version of PKUNZIP is changing almost weekly.
 Most recently the FAA switched to version 2.xxG. ( from versions C and E just
since mid January!) PK must own IBM stock..
 Thanks for your reply.

Sandy,

  A couple of thoughts on your 4in1.   Do you have a power supply hooked up?
Also could it be possible that you might have your cable hooked up backwards at
your board?  I have the 4in1 & an SC2.  I'm using the cable that came with it
and the cable comes out at the bottom.  I know that these are some obvious
things, but sometimes we do overlook the obvious, so please don't be offended.
  Oh, looking back at your msg, you mentioned using xcom9 with mwp.  You might
try using your non-wiz programs with the standard drivers.  (That might be what
you meant when you said "correct" drivers.
   Oh, BTW, I have my Disto clock patched for the IRQ toggle hack that appeared
in the Aug(?) '91(?) '90(?) Rainbow.  I tried to fool around with Wiz and
proacia and after exiting the program, if I turned my modem off, my system
would lock up.
  Anyway, If you haven't already tried, try using ACIAPak and a standard
version of "t2" (modified for the Disto Port) and see what happens.
  Good luck, and if you don't get going, we'll try something else.

  Can someone tell me the correct way to send window display codes from C.
I have been fighting with this for a couple of weeks now, and not getting
any closer.
  I want to send the codes to turn the mouse pointer on & off, as well as
the code to move the pointer to a specified position.

  The only way I have been able to get the pointer on & off code to work, is
to use this form...

#define ESC  31            /*  1f 28 = mouse pointer on  */
#define OFF  40            /*  1f 29 = mouse pointer off */
#define ON   41

  Then when I want to send the code, I do the following..

   putchar(ESC);
   putchar(OFF);

       or

   putchar(ESC);
   putchar(ON);

   This seems to me to be a very dumb way of doing this, but its the only
way that seems to work.
   I can't find any way yet to do the mouse positioning code.

Larry,

First you have to turn off buffering for stdout, like this:

  setbuf(stdout, NULL);

Then you should be able to do something like:

  puts("\0x1F\0x28");

For mouse positioning, it might be easier to do this:

  char mouse_pos[7];
  unsigned short x, y;

  mouse_pos[0] = 0x1b;
  mouse_pos[1] = 0x4e;
  mouse_pos[6] = 0;


  mouse_pos[2] = x >> 8;
  mouse_pos[3] = x & 0xFF;
  mouse_pos[4] = y >> 8;
  mouse_pos[5] = y & 0xFF;
  puts(mouse_pos);

There are probably better ways to do this, this is just off the top of my head.

There's also a cgfx.l for KWindows floating around somewhere, but I don't know
if it has calls for the mouse, I would assume it does.

Bill,
  I still can't seem to get it to work.

  When you use:
    setbuf(stdout, null);

   in order to shut off buffering, what do you use to turn it back on ?
   setbuf(stdout,1);   ??

   How many characters would you set buffering too ?

  What is really throwing me off, is the example that I showed you that works,
 using the DEFINE's , only works sometimes. I can turn the mouse pointer on and
off just fine using that form, but if I add the move pointer routine the on off
 function doesn't work anymore.

  It shouldn't have any effect, because I first shut the pointer off, while
doing one function, when done, I turn the pointer back on. Then later I do the
mouse pointer move stuff. So how can just adding the move pointer routine cause
the on/off codes not to work?
 This is driving me nuts....
