     Tc70/Tc9 null modem. [Tc70 hi speed mod. (Re: Msg 84277)
     From: AYUSKO       To: FHOGG

Do any of these programs (xbufr, rtson, rtsoff) work on normal Tc70 ports ?
(sc2661 driver).  While I'm at it, do you have any idea what
connections need to be made to make a null modem for Tc9 to Tc70
communication ?  I tried a couple of null modems I had, but no
luck. I'll have to try again, but I think at least one problem was
getting the Tc9 to think that it's alright to send. (It just hangs).
Thanks,
   Alex A. Yusko (AYUSKO)

Beats me. Its been too long but I don't think so. I have the files in my
workspace
still so I'll email them to you and you can try them.

A null modem cable should work ok. I know of others who have used them but I
havn't personally used a coco connected to another OS9 OSK machine. The TC9
serial ports are the same as the Eliminator so perhaps someone has used an
Eliminator serial port conne
cted to a OSK machine.

Sorry I couldn't be more help.

That saves me from having to write one. Some of the MW utilities are really
dumb when you really look at them tho aren't they.

Dear Friends:
Does anyone know of any 6809/OS9 multi-user BBS software.  What I am looking
for would be to allow a 2 line BBS with a local terminal for 3 way
conversationsin conferences. Does any one know of any thing shareware or
commercial?  I have
2 rs-232 packs, a cocopro rs-232 pack, and the BitBanger 5 software for a 1200
baud serial port.  Is such a thing practical.  Can the COCO (with 2 megs)
handle it? Can any one get me started on a bare bones outline for such a
program?

Oh well, looks like a fun year ahead, Happy New Year to one and all.
With all best wishes,
Brother Jeremy, CSJW

 I run RiBBS myself, but the author of RCIS was doing just that. His BBS
number is/used to be 201-967-1061.
