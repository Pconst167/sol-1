Sorry for the confusion. 13904 has hit the bit bucket.

In short, it attempted to put to rest a rather long winded discussion on the
use of a 'unofficial' version of the AR archive utility. The author of AR asks
that folks continue to use the official 1.2 version (found here in our

Malcolm, I'm sure that Ole Hansen will let you know about a program I believe
he sells...however, you might be better off just avoiding file fragmentation if
you can. A could of suggestions:

1. Pre-extend the file allocation for what you believe the file's max. size
will be when you create the file. As long as when you close the file you are
not at the EOF, the extra sectors allocated will not be returned to the system.

2. If you have a fragmented file and you have contiguos disk space for it, just
copy that file. If I recall correctly, COPY will do a pre-allocation. After the
copy, just delete the old and do a rename. I wrote a utility awhile ago for
6809 which did that. It is avail in lib10 as 'unfrag.ar'.

Another possibility is to have the mouse interface written as a separate
stand-alone process with a defined data module interface.  All the editor needs
to know is the name of the mouse module (could be in an environment variable)
so it can fork it.  Advantages of this approach are 1) there are no
side-effects mixing mouse info with keyboard input and 2) the data module can
contain fields that time-stamp mouse events, allowing double-click or
inactivity detection, mouse acceleration and so on.  The editor is relieved of
the need to handle all this real-time junk.  Timing gets a bit imprecise when
everything has to feed through stdin.

Well...yes I did the obvious <grin>. But to make sure I'll check again.

First off, I have the file OS9BOOT on HD0. To make sure it is okay I just did
an ident. All is okay.

Next, I fired up DED and examined LSN0. At $15 it shows $01 $24 $9c. So, the
boot is registered. I not that the size of the bootfile is listed as 00 00.
But, that is true on the floppy too...so I assume that the size is ignored.
Hmmm, it'd have to be since the boot is 108K and there are only 2 bytes for the
size.

A dir -e shows that the the 'sector' for os9boot is 1249c. So, things appear
okay in this department.

BTW, when attempting to boot the drive light for HD0 does not show any
activity. Also, it makes no difference if this is a cold boot or if I just hit
RESET. I've left it for a few minutes thinking that maybe it is waiting for the
drive to come up to speed, but no difference.

So, what do I test next?

You might try going into the init module with moded and increase the cold start
retry count.  Run moded on the bootfile and step down through until you see an
entry called "coldstart 'chd' retry count" and increase the number there.  Mine
is set to 50, but you may need to make it higher than that.  If that doesn't
work, I'm at a loss for what to try next. Perhaps someone else here with one of
those ROMs will be able to help more.

Fm: William F. McGill/CA 73177,3433
To: All

Can anyone tell me how to increase the size of the system buffer associated
with the read() and write() commands in C 3.2?

I need to copy a large file, and it seems the system buffer size is rather
small.  It takes about 4 times as long to copy the file using a read() followed
by a write() than it does when I just use the OS9 copy command, specifying "
-b=64k ".

I've read all the manuals, and OS-0 Insights implies that it is possible to
increase the system buffer size, but I haven't found any way to do it.

Any ideas?

In any case (copy included), the system buffers (actually driver buffers) are
usually fixed. Copy is using the same mechanism (i.e. read(), write()). Try
maintaining a large buffer in your application data space, and reading large
chunks until you fill it. Then do a single write().

Thanks for the reply.  My application program is doing what you suggest; the
input buffer is about 125k bytes and does a single read() to fill it. When the
read() command returns, the program does a single write().  But this simple
read() - write() loop takes several times longer to copy a file than when I use
OS9's copy, with -b=64K  (or larger).  I hoped perhaps there way to specify
this option in C.

You say the buffer is actually a driver buffer.  Is there a way to modify the
driver to get it to use a larger buffer?

Thanks again,

You may have to play with the buffer size to get the most efficient copy speed.
I have found that much smaller buffer sizes, like 32k or so, are faster than
larger buffers.  I have done a couple copy utilities that are faster than the
Microware on.

Sb: #17811-Bigger read/write buffer
Fm: William F. McGill/CA 73177,3433

Mark,

Thanks for the advice on buffer selection.  I did play around with various
sizes, and it appears that in this instance the larger the buffer the better.
With a buffer of 1 Meg, copying proceeds at least as fast as the OS-9 copy
command.

The problem turned out to be interference from a higher-priority task, which
was interrupting the data transfer and stealing significant amounts of time. By
suspending the higher-priority task while copying, I was able to get a vast
improvement in copying speed.

Thanks for your help!

Bill

WIlliam, I don;t think it is a buffer size problem. In read you just specify
the buffer size as the 3rd. param. However, utilities like copy pre-extend the
file to the full size...this means that only one file allocation system call is
done...if you want to do the same use the create() call with the optional size
specifier.

Bob,

You are right, it wasn't a buffer size problem after all.  A SCSI-bus analyzer
revealed large gaps during which no transfers were taking place, even though
the drive was ready to accept more data.

The program is running in a multi-tasking environment;  the problem is that a
task with higher priority was also running, and the time allocated to that task
accounted for the gaps in the data transfer.

Setting D_MinPty to 2 and temporarily reducing the higher-priority task to
priority 0 (to suspend it while copying) solved the problem.  The program can
now copy as fast as the OS-9 copy command.

Thanks for your helpful suggestions.

Bill

You must be talking about fread() and fwrite().  There is no internal buffering
on read() and write() since they are low-level functions:

        read (path, buffer, count)

should explain it.  You can make the buffer in your code any size you want.
Actually, 32768 is the largest you can predefine.  You need to use malloc() or
something like that to make a larger buffer.

Hope this helps.

Sb: #MM1 problem
Fm: Hugo Bueno 71211,3662
To: All

I've posted this to the Coco list, but thought I'd try here too...

I finally got my MM1 this week.  I ordered a 1 meg unit with IO board and 1
floppy drive.  When the machine arrived, I booted it up and it worked fine.

Today, I installed 2 more megs of ram and 2 floppy drives. I shorted both sets
of pins on P7 (parallel to minibus) . Upon trying to boot the machine, it
wouldn't.  The screen was blue with OS9 68K Boostrap at the top.  It then very
quickly flashed a message on the screen. I think it said "boot failed, error
status $0100".  What does this mean? A bad boot disk? Unfortunately, I only got
one floppy disk. I'm going to copy the full set from another local MM1 owner.

I brought the machine back to it's original state and it gave the same error.

Any help/ideas would be greatly appreciated. I hope this isn't a hardware
problem.

Hugo,

I'm probably stating the obvious, but all cables checked for proper connection
and pin 1 positioning?

New drives strapped properly?

Well, at this point I'd still like to figure out proper jumper settings for pad
P7.  I've been told on the COco list that the instructions in the IMS manual
are incorrect.  Are the jumpers supposed to be parallel or perpendicular to the
minibus?

Next, on the floppy drives. I guess that'll have to wait until I have a working
bootable floppy.

The instructions are correct, you place the two jumpers parallel to the
mini-bus.

Hugo,

I see Mark has jumpped in on the jumper positions for you.

On the floppy straps, it should be pretty easy. If you got the MM/1 with one
floppy in it and it worked fine, then that one must have been strapped for
drive 0. The other two need to be different.

Also, make sure you're using the 3meg init module. That could be adding to your
troubles.

Does anyone know where I get a manual for a Televideo 965 tube? A phone number

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: Steve Wegert 76703,4255 (X)

Steve, seeing MH's fix for the link() function in blarslib.l reminded me that I
had to make a fix to utime() awhile ago to get it to operate in the manner
expected by a program I was porting from unix. I'm not sure which is the
correct method...so I'll just post my revised source here in this message.
Guess if the program doesn't work one way...one could try this. I don't have
access to the proper docs, so I'm just guessing.

 #include <time.h>
 #include <direct.h>
 #include <modes.h>
 #define NULL 0
 int utime(file, timep)
 char *file;
 time_t timep[2];
 {
     register int p;
     register struct tm *when;
     struct fildes fd;

     if((when = gmtime(&timep[1])) == NULL) return -1;
     /* changed S_IREAD to S_IWRITE bvdp 92/12/17 */
     if((p = open(file, S_IWRITE)) < 0 &&
                (p = open(file, S_IWRITE|S_IFDIR)) < 0) {
        return -1;
     }
     if(_gs_gfd(p, &fd, sizeof fd) < 0) {
        close(p);
        return -1;
     }
     fd.fd_date[0] = when->tm_year;
     fd.fd_date[1] = when->tm_mon + 1;
     fd.fd_date[2] = when->tm_mday;
     fd.fd_date[3] = when->tm_hour;
     fd.fd_date[4] = when->tm_min;
     if(_ss_pfd(p, &fd) < 0) {
        close(p);
                return -1;
     }
     return(close(p)<0) ? -1 : 0;  /* changed!!! bvdp */
  }
