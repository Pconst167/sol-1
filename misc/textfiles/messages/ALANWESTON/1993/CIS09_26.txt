No, not all hard drive systems have the same address maps, as a matter of fact,
each system may have its own address.  Which system are you interested in?{ {I
have a Disto 4-in-1 board, and can supply these addresses if you need them.
   Off the top of my head, I THINK that the different Disto boards may have
different addresses, I'm not sure (I'm composing online, and hate to take the

Thanks, Jay. I don't know about the "C Traps..." book, but "Obfuscated" really
doesn't get into what to avoid, and common bugs all that much. It is more of a
collection of helpful stuff for folks who already know how to program. Probably
not for the beginner. I think it is a worthwhile addition to my library. Much
more so than two other books I just got from my book club. Mind you, I should
have been ready...printed by Microsoft Press. BTW, did you notice that
Microware had an ad in the C Users Journal?

Bill,  do you use vi?  Since vi comes with Unix, we have selected it as the

the PCs.  It is solid and has everything real vi does.  Of course, if you are
more of an emacs man, you wouldn't like vi.  Anyway, I can provide both

Carl,

I use vi only when I have to <g>. I never got a chance to work much with unix
until about 6 months ago, now I'm taking care of a couple of Sparcstations
being set up as network servers. One of the things on my list is to get emacs
going on them so I can get away from vi. Actually vi isn't all that bad, once
you get used to it, but I've been using me on my MM/1 almost since I got it. I
haven't tried any of the OSK vi clones, maybe I should give them a try. It
would be nice to have one editor to deal with, now I'm using about 10 different
editors: two mainframe editors, four PC editors, one for unix, one for OSK, one
for OS9 on my CoCo and one for OS-9000.

I hear ya.  I needed one editor too.  I tried to learn emacs a few years ago
and didn't like it.  I finally gave up and wrote one, but switched to vi when
the first clone came available.  I said I run vi on OSK, DOS, and Unix, but I
forgot to mention it runs on my ST also.  Anyway, editors are like religion,
and inspire about as much passion in discussions.  Some folks like emacs style
modeless editors.  I much prefer an editor with seperate modes for text entry
and changes, like vi.  Drives me crazy to have to prefix everything with a meta
char or two.  I use the colon interface a lot for global changes and such (I
maintain a lot of code vs. just entering text). But I never found a small
enough vi or emacs for the 09.  I just saw what looks like vi in the dls that
runs on an 09 (it said OS-9, not OSK??) so perhaps that would help.  I know you
can get emacs like editors for the PC, and real emacs must exist for Unix.  Or,
elvis should compile on OS-9000 easily and I have working OSK and PC binaries
if you want.

As I reread this, I see and example of passion.  I wrote an editor so I
wouldn't have to use emacs.....

I can upload GNU Emacs 18.55 with complete source for Unix if you wish.
It includes source (very big) which will compile on almost any Unix

Maybe someone could port it to OSK.  I would work on it, but I am working
on BASH first.  I REALLY need a better shell for OSK it is hard working
in OSK after using the Korn Shell on my Unix system at work (and at home).
Geez, maybe I should ask if anyone else is working on BASH.  Don't really

Carl,

What is the current state of AR development? Beta version 1.92 has been posted
since July and I have been using it (CoCo) with no problems except that the
default 13 bit compression does not work on the CoCo so I have to call it with
-uo or -ub12. Oh, yes; the help screen says that the default is 12 bits which I
believe is incorrect.

Is it safe to continue using it? Are there any planned changes which will make
the files it produces obsolete? For me the major advantages over the earlier
version (1.2) are:

 - MUCH faster operation (about twice as fast)
 - The DELETE function
 - The MOVE function
 - Slightly better compression on text files
 - Compression of binaries

Is a final release version (2.0?) on the way?

Yes, it is safe to continue to use.  There will be no changes to make current

About the modem, it has suddenly started going off-hook as soon as it it turned
on.  Otherwise it is working quite well, apparently.  As it is, if you turn it
on, by the time you get set up to dial, the phone line has gone through the
routine of the recording you get and going off-line or whatever.  I'm using
OSTerm and have been getting everything set up to dial and then turning it on.
It's a cheapie Emerson I've had for a little over a year.  I left a msg a
couple of weeks ago  here.  It seems that my modems don't live over a couple of
years..  Steve Wegert suggested that I m could be having trouble with
lightening or something, but I don' t think that is the problem.

Yes, that is correct.  About your modem problem, it shouldn't go off hook until
you issue it a dial command.  If it is doing that as soon as you turn in on,
something is wrong.  Perhaps a register value as been set wrong that is causing
this, or the modem is going bad.

I kinda believe that the modem is going bad.. I've tried atf (or is it at&f,
I'm composing online and won't bother looking it up now,but you get the idea)
and it still stays off-hook.  Another thing... I tried to store a faster dial
rate to NV-ram and then "atz" and it went back to the default, so I do feel
that it is going haywire.  Otherwise, it seems to function faultlessly. I may
try to get one of these things repaired, as I seem to be getting quite a
collection of flakey modems.

Well, hopefully, I'll get to say howdy in Atlanta, I think I saw where you said
you would be there.  I went last year, and met many faces to go with the names
I see all the time.

re you by any chance on a pulse dial line?  I have an old Hayes which is
holding up well but when I got a new (borrowed) 2400 baud Hayes it packed up
quickly mayyer of months) by getting very noisy on the dialing relay (pulse you
see) started to get wrong numbers and or unable to dial messages.  Then a
second USRobotics also went in a similar fashion so now I'm back to the good
old Hayes.  I wonder if the Telco shunt current isn't just a little too high
for these newer modems with absolute bottom dollar relays and few users who
still use pulse dialing.  I am just opposed to letting the Telco take home an
extra couple of dollars every month for the priveledge of using tone dialing.
Especially when they will no longer install a pulse dial phone but still keep
up the pretext that it is an optional extra.  Wait till they HAVE to come and
change it out at their cost.  That's my motto. Bob

No, I'm now using tone dialing, although I was  on pulse till sometthing like a
year ago.  Yes, the extra charge is kind of a rip-off, but it is nice to get
the faster dialing, etc. I suppose it is worth it.  I changed over hoping to
get better svc.  I just might give a Hayes a try.  I assumed that a USRobotics
was near top-of-the-line.  As i remember, it costs nearly as much as a Hayes,
doesn't it?
  About the Telephone company's current... It could be... I live in a rural
area so it's uncertain just what curent they are providing, although I'm really
surprised as to how reliable and clear my data is most of the time. With my
previous modem, a Smart Team, it would take spells of spewing out nothing but
garbage.  I cussed the Tel. Co. quite a bit but after getting this modem,
everything is swell, except for this cotton-picking going off- hook on turn-on.

Brother Jeremy,
   I downloaded your file of gshell 1.25 only to find out that it will not
work. Your Ipatch file is looking for an original file of size 3A95h whereas
gshell 1.24a is size 3b48h. I double checked and my gshell 1.24a is the correct
size. Also, your Ipatch file has gshell 1.25 being smaller than 1.24a. Is this
possible given the fact that features have been added. Please let me know if I

I will hang this message here, although it is in response to the thread in
general.

I do have screens running and running properly.  I have used it since before
the MM/1 (I remember arguing with Pease about screens vs. windows).  I use it
with both ptys and ptyman.  I have found and fixed the most obnoxious bugs, but
some remain.  In general I prefer ptys over ptyman.  I liked not filling up the
device table and module dir with all those pty/tty pairs but ptyman has still
has several problems (page pause happens at a random point in the line vs. at
the end, the input buffer is flushed on the check for page pause release, page
pause release chars are buffered and eventually displayed, some signals are not
handled right, line wrap is not handled right, can't do 'tmode normal', etc)
that I haven't had time to chase.  OTOH, ptys doesn't like the version of scf
that comes with 2.4 (ver. 31).  That is the reason you can't open more than a
couple windows.  It is an interaction with the signals and the changes MW made
to kill processes on CD loss.  It works fine with scf ver. 29, which is what I
use.  The only problem is getting the address for the shared memory right.  As
it came, it was set for an Atari ST, but I have fixed that so it should work on
anything.  In addition, I hacked screen to use a named config file, so I can
start up with different configurations (root window, 9 windows for my project,
or 2 root windows, 2 C source windows, 2 OSK source windows, etc).

So where are y'all now?  Do you have the problems fixed or should you all trash
what you have and I upload my versions?

Right now I'm using the version of screen that Bob van der Poel uploaded, which

but I don't want to use an old version of SCF. So as far as I'm concerned, at

I am going to stick with ptyman for now.  I agree with what you wrote about

manager for the pty's.  I am also using SCF edition#29.  I haven't had any
problems with Bob's ptyman upload, but I haven't tried to see how many screens
I can use at once.  I am using this on a KiX\30 with Wyse50 and Wyse60
terminals.

BUT we can never have too many choices.  I would like to try out your modified
ptys (this is the version that uses SCF, right?).

You *could* go in with a disk zapper (fm or ded) and set the first character of
the bad file's name in the directory to a 0. That will lock out the file from
being accessed and lockout the sectors allocated to the file from being
reallocated. Of course, if the file contains good sectors too, it is a bit of a
waste. However, as Zack said, the best thing to do is to restore the drive. I
had problems with my original Quantum drive, but I called them and had it
replaced. In about a year of running now I have yet to get a sector error.

  I have just uploaded a slightly crippled version of my
  CirCad schematic drawing program.  Yep, another "crippled
  DEMO".  The drawing functions are all there, but the file
  input/output functions are dead, except for the file I/O
  from the edit buffer, which works.  I left that part in to
  allow users to trade little diagrams and saved "objects"
  easily and maybe make some of the explanations in technical
  discussions in the forum a little easier - just send a
  diagram.

  Circad draws diagrams on the MM/1 screen and writes them to
  a file in the PostScript printer control language.  A
  second file stores the coded drawing commands in CirCad's
  own format.


  It includes a set of basic drawing tools and a few extra ones,
  and some built-in electrical and electronics schematic
  symbols.

  The program came about when I was preparing a schematic
  drawing for the electricians at a local factory where I had
  recently installed new electronic controls on a heating and
  air conditioning system.

  I had (finally) convinced GhostScript to compile and run on
  the MM/1 and I thought it could draw a neat diagram if I
  could write the file.  I drew the schematic on graph paper
  and translated it into PostScript (with help from some
  reference books), writing the PostScript file with a text
  editor.  The diagram looked great, but writing the
  PostScript file was a long job.  At this point, CirCad began
  to develop.

  CirCad is being distributed by Mark Griffith's "DIRT CHEAP

 Not sure what this thread is all about...but I thought I'd throw in my
 latest experience with NOT inizing drivers. I use /t3 and /4 for my
 modem and a remote terminal. If I don't INIZ them, using the modem causes
 /t4 (which is running tsmon) to change baud rate. It appears that it is
 good practice to iniz all devices? Or should some be left alone?

Well ... that sort of depends. If I were to iniz my serial devices, mtsmon
wouldn't sense the drop of DTR and recylcle itself upon loss of carrier. But
... the stock tsmon hasn't figured out how to do that so inizing with the stock
drivers shouldn't be a problem.

By the way ... I've not had any problem with baud rate changing on it's own.

The original comlaint I had was with the printer drivers. (I'm not using your
polled stuff ...  just the latest stock offerings from Carl).

I've found that without inizing /p, killing a print job in process and
attempting to send another job to the printer will hang the machine.

Speaking of monitoring DTR with tsmon...is there any way I can do something to
avoid this:

   I have a terminal hooked up to /t4 via a 4 wire cable. The wires are
   assigned to GND, TXD, RXD and RTS. All works well, unless the terminal
   user does something to lock his process (probably a crash...). The only
   way to restart the remote user is to kill his shell, etc. from the

 Project: Forker

     Inspired by the excellent, Shell+ for OS-9 Level 2, StrongWare is
     developing a replacement shell for OS-9/68000 (OSK).  This project
     is in a very early stage!, therefore no estimated release date is
     possible.

 Announcement purpose:

     1.  To allow OSK users to comment on what features they would like
         to see in an enhanced shell for OSK.

     2.  To give the OSK community an idea of the features planned for
         Forker, so that they may comment on them.

     3.  To gauge the interest of OSKers in an enhanced shell. (Will it
         be worth the time and effort required to complete Forker?)

     4.  To remind OSK programmers that they should check the standard
         enviroment variable, "SHELL", to obtain the name of the users
         shell, instead of just forking "shell".

 Forker options:
     -b             print blocking.
     -nb            no print blocking.
     -c             display help for commands.
     -e[=<path>]    print error explanations.
     -ne            don't print error explanations.
     -p[=<prompt>]  print prompt.
     -np            don't print prompt.
     -t             echo input lines.
     -nt            don't echo input lines.
     -x             exit on error.
     -nx            don't exit on error.
     -l             require "logout" to logout.
     -nl            <eof> on input will logout.
     -v             print attempts to execute command.
     -nv            don't print attempts to execute command.

 Forker commands:

I do a lot of work in Unix and like the shells that are available there
(especially the Korn Shell).  So I plan on using BASH for my replacement
shell.  It is nice not having say "darn!!! I can't do that with this shell"
(cleaned up for publication        ^^^^      :-o  )

John,

Now to throw cold water on your efforts but .... (you knew _that_ was coming!)

With all the other shells (tshell, csh, sh, bash) available to OSK users, do we
need yet another shell? Is it something so special folks already having access

Why not divert your effort towards an application that we don't have for OSK?

A new shell must have several things to be interesting:
 1) aliases
 2) command history
 3) command line recall and edit
 4) for loops

Of course, case, while, test, etc, would be nice.  But I don't think a day goes

Are any smaller than 10k?  My other OSK machine is a 512k Atari ST. Not a lot
of memory for large Unix type shells, also the most common memory size for
Burke & Burke's Rocket will probably be 512K.

That's the big question!  Also don't forget that there are lots of folks who
don't have access to those shells or CIS and/or the other services.

I'm also porting some of my games to the MM/1.  CopyCat is 90% complete. Gems
is being worked on.  However porting 90+ pages of 6809 code & data to 68000
code can get quite boring, so I've got to keep an interesting project on the
back burner.

I plan to have an 'alias' feature, however hardcoding features has its
advantages and in many cases not that hard.

Here is the current code for dl (del), dlx (del -x), md (makdir) & mxd (makdir
-x):

delx:   move.b  #Exec_,d0
  bra.s   del_1 del:      moveq   #0,d0

del_1:  move.l  line(a6),a0     point a0 to pathlist
        os9     I$Delete
        bcs.s   prterror

        move.l  a0,line(a6)
        rts

makxdir:        move.b  #Updat_+Exec_+Dir_,d0
        bra.s   makdir1

makdir: move.b  #Updat_+Dir_,d0

makdir1:        move.w  #$bf,d1         all attrs, exec non-shareable
        move.l  line(a6),a0     point a0 to pathlist
        os9     I$MakDir
        bcs.s   prterror

        move.l a0,line(a6)
        rts

Fairly simple I think.

 I have two things I would like to see. One is that the prompt should be
 able to be setup so it shows the current working directory. The second is
 for it to know about basic. Currently I use SH, mainly because I can set
 it up so the command line is the CWD. If your Forker has these two features
 I am sure it will have many more and I will put my money where my mouth is.

 A UNIX style shell, such as the Korn shell, is a much larger project

You might find it easier and more versatile to implement your extra features
via an 'alias' feature rather than hard-coding stuff into the shell. For
example, you have a feature 'mkxdir'. However, I might prefer to use my own
"super-dupper" makdir command. So why not have the option to create an alias
which converts mkxdir into "makdir -x".

Good luck.

Sounds like some of the problems I'm having. Can you show me where exactly in
the code you're adding termcap capablilities?  Perhaps _that_ where we're going
wrong.

Bob,

I'm attempting to get used to screen. So far so good, but it's less than
intuative command structure is ahh .... wellll ....


Anyway, I'm having some difficulties with the termcap entry and wondered if you
could help.

Right out of the box (so to speak), my copy of sterm wouldn't run as it
required a 'le' parameter in the termcap. I popped the code, stuck one in,
recompiled and all is well.

But  causing me real withdrawl is the absence of a standout mode. My tube
emulates a tvi910 and does support so/se, but for some reason screen doesn't
put one in. Even calling screen with -a option doesn't help here. Ideas?

Also, I've not been able to get the ^\C command (that's an upper case 'C') to
work. Shouldn't it terminate screen immediately? What am I missing?

Have you tried to run DED in a screen window?  I can't seem to get the <esc>
key to be recognized (but it works fine in Sterm!)  Ideas?

Not sure how much help I can be....after all, I didn't write this! But, lets
see:

Don't know why sterm needs 'le' (backspace code). I checked my source and it
does look for it, but never seems to use it. Anyway, it is probably just as
well to add it to screen. Matter of fact, the termcap creater in screen should
really copy all the termcap entries and modify the ones it knows about? Maybe?

I have standout defined in both my vsc and televideo 965 entries and screen
seems to honor them just fine. Ummm, does the screen termcap entry show
anything for "so/se"? Oh, do you have "me" defined. Looking at the source real
fast...it appears that something is done to "so/se" if "me" is defined. I think
the logic may be incorrect in ansi.c. Try taking "me" out of your termcap and
see what happens. I think that the application is probably looking for "se" and
ignoring "me".

What is ^\C supposed to do? If I do a <CTRL-\> followed by a <C> I create a new
 screen. To delete the current screen I do an EOF which ptyman redefines as a
CTRL-D (not ESC).

Just tried DED. Seems to be okay expect for when it prints the lsn #. Seems to
get gotoxy() screwed up.

I wonder...before we all get hacking on this version, is there a more current
unix version kicking around. Might be that termcap bug fixes have been done
already.

The screen termcap doesn't show anything for so/se, and I don't have 'me'
defined in my tvi910 entry. I need to use a couple different terminals with
screen and see if I can spot a pattern. Standout isn't a big deal on the tvi
tube as it really handles it poorly, but using 'nn' on the university computer
required it .... until I figured out how to turn on the 'slow' mode which marks
each selection with an '*' rather than hilighting.

The man page may be a bit unclear with this. What I'm tring to do is terminate
the screen session immediately. Right now I have to <cntrl-\><k> my way through
all the windows before it quits. The man pages seem to indicate there's an
'immediate' kill switch.

Where I hap problems was in Editing .... hitting the <ESC> key to switch
between byte/char modes, Ded just sat there.

I get the same problem with ESC in ded. Mind you, ya probably shouldn't be
using it from a remote terminal anyways...maybe it knows?? I tried changing the
EOF char in the path desc. in the pty generated tmode entry but it didn't
change anything.

Funny about so/se disappearing. You might want to have a look at the ansi.c
file to see what screen is saving/swallowing. Might spot something in your
termcap I'm missing from mine which is causing the problem. I just know that
so/se get passed to my vsc and tv965 entries.

Oh, I see what you mean about CTRL-\. Having a fast look at screen.c it appears
that there is a test for META-META...which is what you are doing since META by
default is CTRL-\. Guess you'll have to recompile with the KEY_QUIT set to
something else. It should just be a matter of changing the slot KEY_QUIT is
assigned to in InitKeyTab().

Bob,

I've narrowed down the missing so/se problem to some type of test statement in
ansi.c. It checks for sg<=0. The sg parameter in my tvi910 entry is set for 1.

When I change that to 0, so/se reappear in screen's termcap entry.

I hacked in the entries for ho (needed it for a cls command I use) and le
(sterm) and seem to be doing just fine.

Not sure why the standout glitch is messing with things but ..

MM/1 owners,

I need a small poll of potential MM/1 accelerator customers.  We have placed
three beta units and preliminary results are starting to come in.  The first
disturbing one is that Paul's board house apparently substitiuted 74HC257 parts
for the spceified 74AC257 parts.  The result of this is that the MM/1 will not
run with three cycle memory access.

There are two solutions: ship a four cycle pal or replace the 257's.  The four
cycle pal will reduce performance by 20% (2800 dhrystones at 16Mhz to 2250),
which is still a large improvement, but not as much as *I* wanted when we
designed this.  You can install proper parts (three needed, available from
DigiKey for $1.23 each), or Kevin or perhaps Mark could provide and install the
right parts for perhaps $25.

The question then is, is there preference for any of the three solutions or are
there more alternatives?
 1) Four Cycle pal and lower performance.
 2) You change three chips.
 3) You pay someone else to change three chips.
 4) ???????

Please reply to 71076,76 (or 71076.76@compuserve.com)

I don't know where most MM/1 users hang out.  Could someone perhaps copy this
to any other services where MM/1 users can be found?

Personally, I'd change the 3 chips myself, but it's probably a good idea to
have the service available.  I _don't_ like option 1 (4 cycle pal).

After playing with Ghostscript and TeX, I am very interested in anything that
makes my michine faster (GRIN).

I can change chips.

Lots of MM/1 users hang out on Delphi (tho many of those are here too) - I will
post your query there if someone else hasn't beat me to it.

Carl, Without opening up my box, I don't know if the 257s are socketed or glued
in...probably the later and I don't like to practice my limited skills on a
multi-layer board. The other problem I see is sending the board off for
service/upgrading...just because of some of the long delays we've all
experienced in the past I'm hesitate to let things out of my grasp. Maybe the
slower solution would be best? Don't know.

They are not socketed.  We are hoping that only a few early boards are a
problem.  So far lots of people seem to have the faster parts.

I understand your concerns.  All I can say is that this is a different set of
people.  I hope better, but only time will tell that.

So far it is about 10:1 in favor of speed and changing chips if necessary.

I've lost track of the part numbers... I just checked my I/O board and I have 3
74HC257's next to the RAM. Are those the bad ones? If so, could I bring the
board with me to Atlanta next weekend? Maybe someone there can do the surgery

Carl,

If those chips are socketed I'd say do the chip swap. If they're soldered in,
forget it. I'm not going to endanger a $1500 investment with a soldering iron.
Coco's were different. They were cheap and easy to replace if necessary, the
MM1 is not.

I peeked.  Looks like 74AC257s .  It's kinda tricky, the "A" doesn't quite meet
at the top point, but the sides of the letter definetly slope, so I'm pretty
sure its not an "H".  Serial nr 120838.  Kinda like trying to tell the
difference between a "U" and a "V" in the model or serial number of an
appliance with a DMP-printed tag. ARGH.

I have some notes on BASH that I hope maybe you can pass on to the
person you got it from.

When I first start bash I get shell-init: getwd: cannot access parent
directories.
Whenever I cd I get cd_links: getwd: cannot access parent directories
(it does allow the cd though, so I can change dir) and also cd: getwd:
cannot access parent directories.
I tried running as user 0.0 and also all parent directories (back to /h0)
are d-ewrewr
Thanks.

PS. or maybe he would allow the source to be posted and I could take a

Very strange ....

In my breif testing of bash, I get none of these difficulties. It seems pretty
solid right out of the box.

How are you impletmenting it? I'm just loading it into memory and calling it.

Anyone else having problems?

I am just calling bash.  When it first starts up I get that message.

I also tried using it as my login shell (in password file) and I got
: (E$BPNam) Bad pathlist specified
The pathlist specified is syntactically incorrect.
So I took it back out of password and call it after I have logged in.

Something I might be doing different.  Are you always user 0.0 ?
I use systs and login as user 0.10

However I seem to remember trying it as 0.0 and getting the same results.

Thought you were onto something with the user id thing so I did a couple of
tests. Calling bash as user 3.3 showed no problems. I also set up user 3.3
first program as bash ... again, no problem.

The upload is my port of Ghostscript, version 2.6.1 for OSK.

So far, I got the first two (of 15) files uploaded - hope to get the rest of it
up by the weekend.  It will probably take a couple more nights to get it all on
(assuming you can make the space available).

This program prints "laser quality" documents with my MM/1 and a 24-pin epson

 *** CALL FOR BETA TESTERS ***

Ken Scales has written a graphical front end for Ved and Vprint for use on the
mm/1 with kwindows called KVED. This program brings point and click commands to
ved and an enhanced macro/framework suite for developing vprint and programming
language support. We'd like to have some existing Ved/Vprint users test this
out...so here's a too-good-to-be-true offer. If you are a current Ved and
Vprint registered owner and run them on the mm/1, send us a disk in a mailer
and we'll copy the latest versions of the programs plus kved to your disk and
return it to you, no charge. The only stipulation is that the disk must reach
us before Oct 15/93 and you must agree to give any feedback on the combo to
BVDP Software or to Ken Scales.

Mike, I got the fmod(). Thanks. It is amazing...this is a 2 line function and
yet I have a listing for the same in Plauger's 'The Standard C Library' and it
goes on for a full page, plus it calls 2 other full page functions. I
wonder--which do you think runs faster? <g>.
