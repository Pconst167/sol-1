Yes, it is a little dangerous assuming anything, really, in regard to what
someone else might have.  I kinda hate to call a process in this way myself,
but in a case like this, this would seem to be the only feasible way, except
for writing the code to do so into the program. Hmm... I wonder if it would be
good to incorporate a pwd function into the library???

Well, anyway, I figured that you already had the problem worked out, but I
thought it would be interesting to shove the idea along anyway.

Take care...

There's a pwd() function up in lib 12.

If so, how 'bout   "OS-9 Post-Dispatch"

OS-9 International - The journal for OS-9/68K users and software developers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OS-9 International is devoted to the operating system OS-9 that we
feel would merit much more attention than it actually receives.
The aim of this journal is, therefore, to confirm those peoples'
decision who already work with OS-9 and to convince all others who
do not yet.

In order to reach this - admittedly ambitious - goal,
OS-9 International will

  *  maintain a list of OS-9 sites that have public domain software
     available
  *  reserve pages for OS-9 user groups (OS-9 International is actually
     the official organ of the EFFO - The European Forum For OS-9)
  *  present professional articles on software solutions for common
     problems
  *  conduct software and hardware tests
  *  print letters and short communications in order to establish a
     platform between OS-9 users and programmers
  *  publish features of commercially available OS-9 software
     (maximally one product per issue)
  *  contain advertisement for OS-9 related products.


Please understand this message also as a call for papers: Take this
opportunity to make OS-9 International a forum you want it to be. If
everything works out the way we expect, we will even be able to pay
a - modest, but nevertheless - honorarium for articles published in
OS-9 International. Instructions for authors are available upon request.

We would be very happy if you decided to read OS-9 International.

Please let us know, if you have any suggestion of how we can make
OS-9 International successful.

I got a copy of the second issue of the OS-9 International at Chicago a few
weeks ago. I think it was a lot better for us "on this side of the pond" since
it was mostly in English. (I also got a copy of the first issue last year, and
it was mostly German.)

I am very interested in subscribing this this magazine, but am a little
dubious. I called my bank and got the current exchange rate for US dollars to
Swiss Francs, and it is 1.4308 US dollars to 1 Swiss Franc. That makes your
subscription for six issues a whopping $58 US!! That is VERY expensive for just
six issues of what basically is a users group newsletter.

I have a decent job and can afford to blow the money, but I'm afraid you aren't
going to get very many subscriptions Stateside at those rates, I'm afraid.

Whoops! I misstated the exchange rate. It IS 1.4308, and as the lady explained
it to me, to covert Swiss Francs to US Dollars, one divides the Swiss Francs by
the 1.4308 to get US dollars. So the quote of $58 US is correct.

Hello,

Sorry that this was not clear. OS-9 International is certainly *not* intended
to be
a users group newsletter. It is intended to be a journal devoted to the
operating
system OS-9; among other things it is the official organ of EFFO.
The price for the journal is only symbolic. It does not at all cover the
production
costs nor was anyone ever paid for his work. If people cannot afford this price,
then we simply got an answer to our question whether such a journal is feasible
or not.

Sb: #Multipak trouble
Fm: Denise Tomlinson 71021,3274
To: all

My son was using my Coco 3 with a multipak and didn't realize that the rubber
feet of the coco came off. The multipak still had the feet. Aparently the
multipak must have got a bad connection between it and the coco and  the
multipak got zapped. The Coco boots normally with the disk controller plugged
into the rom port but refuses to boot with the multipak plugged in. All I get
is a dark screen, no vdg screen or anything. I cleaned and checked the 34 pin
connectors and especially checked the multipak edge connector for damage and
found nothing Do you have an idea what chip might have gotten zapped? I can
replace chips with a solder iron and Ic sockets, I have done them before. I
used to do that kind of work at a shop once. Could the pal chip have gotten
zapped? With the new pal chip, will the multipak work with a Coco 2? As a
double check, I tried hooking the pak to a Coco 2 to make sure the trouble was
in the pak. Seems like I remember that when the new style pal chip is put in a
"pak" it won't work for a Coco 2 unless you have a switcher socket and the old
chip. I really need the pak working because I use the Coco 3 with a Midi card
to play a Synthisizer. Thanks, Denise Ps: If I get the pak working again, I'll
replace the rubber feet on the Coco, and mount the whole unit on a piece of
plywood so this won't happen again.

Actaully, Mike, it was much easier with unzip. Didn't need to write a single
line of code to fix the -a option. The code to do the translations was already
in there...however, it was wrapped with a bunch of #if s. Just a matter of
adding a #ifdef OSK to the list and now unzip figures it is creating mac files.
These #if sure to complicate otherwise easy to follow code!

Anyway, I've uploaded the new cut of unzip.lzh to lib 12.

BTW, any success on that latest set of mroff macros I mailed you <g>?

Well, It's been a terrible week here.  But ended up very well. :)

On last monday, I installed a brand new 600 meg HD on the MM/1.  When I plugged
my HD with all my source back in to copy the files to the new HD. I plugged the
SCSI cable in backwards, turned the computer on and ZAP! Bye Bye source code.
:(  That drive had -ALL- my source code on it, UUCP, RN, CNEWS, ELM, CGFX, and
all my commercial software source too!

Luckily, Maxtor was kinda enough to send my a replacement HD, but couldn't
(Wouldn't) fix my existing HD.  So I waited 3 days for the new Maxtor....

When it came I was able to swap out the PC boards and get the data off my
source drive.  <Whew!>  Then re-swapped the boards and sent the bad drive back
to Maxtor.  (Thank God they will send you a replacement drive and let you ship
the bad one back AFTER you get the new one!)

I got really, really lucky this time.  (The knewest backup I had was 9 Months
old)  Time to run out and get a Tape or Floptical drive before anything else
happens.

Can you relate to having everything you ever wrote, including those special
personal tools, destroyed in seconds!  Not a pretty picture.

BTW the 600 meg Seagate I got for $600 bucks in Los Angeles.  (Good deal)

Most of the macros at the beginning of those man pages has to be pulled. Mroff
doesn't support the .if <expr> command stuff.  And most of the font commands
are strictly troff commands, we can't simulate all the macros.

But most can be easily reworked.   The macros you have worked after a little
tweaking of the file.

Now, If I had 9 megs of memory on this sucker I could compile groff and forget
that M/Proff ever existed.  But there's no mo' 9 meg boards, and Kev hasn't had
a chance to run anymore.  :(

Too bad the gpp compiler can't use a disk file instead of needing 5 meg to run
in.
