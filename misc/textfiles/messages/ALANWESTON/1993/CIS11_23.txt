I still run OS9 on Tandy CoCo sometimes but would like to run OS9 on my Amiga
A500 which has 2.5 Mb of RAM and A hard disk. Obviously this would be faster
than in the past.
Does anyone know if it availlable for the above machine?
Thanks.

I pulled this down from the CoCo List in September. It has some interesting
comments on OS9 for the Amiga.

Steve

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi All, I received the following summary from Digby Tarvin, the person who
ported OS9 to the Amiga.

---- Summary follows --

Firstly, let me quickly review the products available from Microware. The
initial 6809 product, which was available as level I or II (the latter
supporting an expanded memory model) has been discontinued. Its successor,
OS-9/68000, is available as either "Industrial" or "Professional". Industrial
OS-9 is Kernel and serial I/O only, and is intended for imbedded systems.
Professional is intended as a multi user development system including
everything in industrial, plus file system and tape support, a full range of
utilities and the Microware C compiler. An earlier "Personal" OS-9 package
intended for hobyists has unfortunately been discontinued.

A variation on the above packages is required for use with 68020 or better
processors. This version is called OS-9/68020 and comes with a different kernel
and enhanced C compiler to allow access to the more powerful instruction set.
The correct kernel must be used for the host CPU, but there is no difference
for application software. The OS-9/68020 versions cost about 50\% more than
their 68000 counterparts.

Finally, Microware have released a kernel which has been re-coded in C, called
OS-9000. The main effect this has is to allow non Motorolla systems to be
supported. It does, however, require a more powerfull CPU. For example a
minimum 68020 for Motorolla or 386 for Intel platforms.

The Microware product that we have licenced is Professional OS-9\/68000 Version
2\.4. We are attempting to keep the price at US\$600.00 in line with Microwares
price for the equivalent Atari product. Unfortunately, even though this is
quite a bit below the the recommended retail price, it is expensive for hobyist
use.

An OS-9/68020 version of our port has been tested on an A3000, but we are
waiting for some definite interest before comitting the money for a licence.
Consequently, I cannot quote an exact price at this stage. We have not licensed
the OS-9000 product yet as it could only be used on a small subset of Amiga
machines (those with 68020 or better processors), and the 68000 product is
still better supported (new products are usually available for OS-9/68000
before OS-9000). It is also quite a bit more expensive, so it will probably
wait till there is some evidence of demand.

We use the system in house on A1000, A2000 and A3000. It has also been used at
Microware on A500s.

It is a bit difficult to summarise the technical details in a couple of pages,
but I would be happy to answer any specific questions you may have about the
implementation or support for specific disk controllers and other hardware.

As a very brief outline, the system takes over the Amiga completely so it
retains its realtime qualities and performs like a very standard OS-9
environment. It requires no rom replacement or other hardware modification, so
switching between OS-9 and Amigados (or any other operating system) requires
only a re-boot. The Amiga display is supported as a colour text terminal with
customizable emulation and font module support. It also supports multiple
virtual screens much like that provided by Amiga Unix.

Several graphical environments are available for OS-9, including Rave, X11,
gwindows and MGR. However these are not currently supported for the Amiga
display.

We are looking at these but the main problem is the substantial price increase
that would result and of course deciding on the most appropriate choice. Rave
would allow CDI application compatibility which may be of interest to hobbyists
and developers, X11 of course provides increased UNIX workstation
compatibility, and gwindows/MGR a Mac style operating environment. A company in
Switzerland have volunteered to undertake a port of MGR which I will be very
interested to see.

To summarise some answers to some common questions:
 Operating System Vers: Professional OS-9/68000 V2.4
 Booting:               Can boot from any floppy or hard disk
                        OS9 Kickstart may be used on A1000 to gain
                        an extra 256K of write-protectable ram.
                        Supported by AmigaDOS
 Terminals:             VT100 emulation on amiga display
                        Full support for amiga serial port
                        Driver for ASGD serial card available
                        Commodore A2232 driver under development
 Disks:                 Internal floppy drive supported
                        Primary format is amiga standard encoding
                        OS-9 Universal format supported for
                        compatibility

                        Driver for A2091/A3000/A590 HD available soon
                        (new SCSI driver technology will support SCSI tape
                        disk etc)
 Amiga Utilities:       AmigaDOS file system access utility
                        Convert amiga font files to OS9 font modules

 SSM:                   SSM may be used when hardware supports it.

 Price:                 US$600.00

We are currenty updating our licence to include the new Microware 'Ultra C'
Ansi C compiler technology. This will add about US$150.00 to the price of a
license. The compiler if purchased separately from Microware will be priced at
US$1,300. This would seem like a good buy for professional users, but does
increase the entry cost for hobyists. I would be interested in any thoughts you
may have on this.

Thank you again for your enquiry. I hope this information is of some
assistance.

Well I lost my hard drive on my MM/1. It was a seagate ST157N. I did have a
backup from about 2 weeks ago (thanks Mark for HDBackup). I have a new HD
coming in, it is a Maxtor 7213SR 213meg unit. Is there anything I need to know
about installing it? Like jumper settings or such. I guess I will need to
change my maxcount to around 32000 since this one will be alot faster than my
old one.

Make certain you match the SCSI ID. I think Maxtor ships drives set to
something other than what you'd expect. Mark may be able to help with the
settings.

I've got my maxcount set to 2048 to help eliminate the mouse locking problem.
You may want to experiment with what's best for you.

Also, if the Seagate is the terminated device now, you'll want to make sure the
Maxtor is as well when you complete the installation.

I've got the same drive...all you need to do is set the SCSI ID # via the
jumpers. If it a 2nd drive you need to pull the resistor packs too. BTW, I have
my maxcount set to 16384; and I've heard others with even smaller values.
Apparently if you get it small enuf the mouse lock-up problems go away.

Keith,

Sorry to hear about your hard drive passing away. But I'm glad to hear you have
chosen an excellent replacement. Life goes on!!

I have TWO 7213S Maxtors, dunno what the SR is, but I have been utterly
satisfied with mine. I posted a "war story" file to the BITNET list which
described my experiance of replacing my Seagate ST1096N with my first Maxtor
7213S. I'll try to dig up a copy and mail it to you. In case it doesn't
mention, my /h0 dmode shows maxcount at 65535.

That's the default value, Zack. After talking Kevin P., I've found that
reducing the value to 2048 has all but eliminated my mouse lock up problem.
What few I have left are solved by running a little script I put together with
the help of Mike Haaland:

 load -d /dd/bootmods/update/scf/mods/t2
 xmode /t2 baud=1200
 iniz /t2

Hmmm, ... why couldn't you just:

$ cd /dd/bootmods/update/scf/mods
$ xmode /t2 baud=1200
$ save t2 -f=t2.1200
$ fixmod -u t2.1200
$ chd <dir containing bootlist files>
$ <edit bootlist to refer to t2.1200>
$ os9gen -eb=200 /d0 -z=<bootlist filename>

Can't remember if the fixmod is required, but it wouldn't hoit!! I have
a /t0 device modified in this very manner to 2400 baud. You may still need
to do the iniz /t2 in your startup.

Well ... originally, one was not supposed to have both the mouse stuff and
 /t2 both in the boot at the same time. I suppose this has changed somewhere
along the line.

I'm not certain it's having /t2 in memory that fixes the mouse lockups or the
fact that it's iniz'd that clears the problem.

Don't know if this helps in your design, but I just bought a pair of "computer

I have two Maxtor 7213S 203Mb hard drives on my MM/1. Note the S suffix on the
model number. That means it is a SCSI drive and not an IDE drive. The SCSI
version of the 7213 costs anywhere from $70 to $100 more than then IDE version.

Oh, and btw, I couldn't be more happier with the Maxtors. No problems
whatsoever with either of them. And man are they small!!

Maxtor has facilities in Colorodo, California and Singapore. All the R&D and
first production runs are done in the States. Then the line is moved to the
Pacific Rim for mass manufacturing.

The company that Mark Griffith works for (and the one I used to work for) is
responsible for those bar code labels on the drives.

Sb: #Ultra ???? C
Fm: Carl Kreider 71076,76
To: ucc gurus

It's been a tough couple days.  My project is out of ram and rom space, but I
figure a better compiler than v3.2 will bail me out.  That will let me use
'const' to keep the menu trees from getting copied from rom to ram, and better
code generation will free up some rom space.  Easy, huh?  Only problem is, gcc
(while it does generate slightly better code) still puts a vsect around the
menu trees and references them off a6, even when they are made const.  About
this time, the new Ultra C arrived.  I got it loaded and patched cc to ucc and
make to umake so it wouldn't collide with the other guys doing development.
Surely ucc will fix me up.  Nope, ucc  generates considerably larger
executables.  Huh??? Yep, about 15% bigger.  The two I was working with are
about 60K and 80K, so they are mostly mine, but the manual (I had *plenty* of
time to read the manuals - ucc is *slow*) says this can happen with the ansi
libraries, so I tweak the makefile again and use -bc for backwards
compatibility. Still bigger.  But I found that I should use -t=0 to force
optimizaton for minimal space, so torch the .r files and try again.  Still
bigger. The best I could do was 5% bigger.  (I almost couldn't compile a couple
files with big state machine switch tables - took 1.8M of free memory after
compiler et al were loaded).

So here is the question for you ucc experts: what is the secret?  What am I
doing wrong?

whew!, I thought it was just me!! I was begining to think I'm just a bad 'C'
programmer, well maybe i'm still that!. Anyway YES, I DO get CONSIDERABLY
BIGGER code and a dead-snail's paced compile time and forget about using /r0
for temp files to increase compile time! I downloaded a source on this forum
called 'sc1.c' - scientific calculator which takes 3 minutes to compile on c
3.2 but takes 3 minutes plus a long shower (I could not wait any longer - was
already late for work) for it to tell me that I had ran out of memory - this is
an 80 something 'K' source code. After foregoing '/r0' temp files and unlinking
just about every- thing in memory I finally got it to compile - lets say around
10 minutes or so and about a 15 percent increase in code size. I got so
discouraged that I reinstalled c v3.2. Thank God for the REINSTALL_OLD script
included with Ultra 'C'. I am going to go pick uucc 1.1 next week and I will
see if it improves comp time/code size.

Oh well, I setting here listening to by new toy - not a computer, but DMX -

ranging from AC to Salsa -what ever that is! Back to OS9 I did try some of the
'time-space knobs', I forgot thr option flags, described in the Manual but did
not find any appreciable code size difference. In fact your code can actually
grow MUCH bigger if you allow maximum loop unrolling. I did a loop (for
(i=0;i<1000;i++) and it unrolled that sucker to nearly 30k or something like
that. Fast, but very big for a 'do' loop that does nothing. I'm definatley NOT
a power user when it comes to 'C', just a novice, so 'C' 3.2 will do me just
fine

I hear ya!  In fact I think "power user" has little to to with compiler choice.
3.2 isn't ANSI, which would be nice.  But I know where all the caveats are, and
that is worth a ton when you ship product based on that compiler.  As you saw
in my second message, I fiddled the time-space knobs too.  It appears that ucc
might be ok if it had an 'embedded library' that was lean and mean but had
floating point.  3.2 was smaller but had floats.

No ucc power users by here yet, huh?

I have some new info to share.  Contrary to what the manual says, apparently
even in backward compatibility mode you still have to tell it to use word
accesses if that is what you want.  That did help reduce the size of the
executables, but they are still larger than those produced by cc and gcc. The
actual code produced for my program is smaller now by about 6%, but when you
link it against the provided libraries, it ends up bigger.  The difference in
my application appears to be around 8K due to the libraries (and I'm using the
backwards compatibility mode to hold it to that much growth).  There is an
option to use the "small" libraries, but they don't do floating point, so I
would have to write a fixed point math library or something.  Oh, and the
programs run when compiled with cc, but crash with divide by zero when compiled
with gcc and with bus error when compiled with ucc.  Most likely by problem,
but a bit dis-heartening.

This parallels my experiance with Ultra C V1.0. Unfortunately for me, I
picked up Ultra-C last year on a special deal which Microware was offering.
I paid $499 for it, I understand the regular price is $999. I called my
Microware salesman a few weeks ago and found that a V1.1 upgrade would
cost me $395!!!!! I guess that is a good price if one paid $999 for V1.0,
but it sucks for me to have to pay just $100 less than what I paid for the
original just to get an upgrade. An upgrade which sounds like does not
fix the original problems. That is, consistently larger binaries and
much longer compile times, and for what?

Ian, Can't recall what he problem was with shell variables being input on the

can't remember what the difficulty was. As for rename.....you would need a
rename command that does its own wildcard manipulations as opposed to the shell
processing them.  The shell will expand whatever is passed to it and then pass
along the expanded version to the command which is requested. Not what you need
to do the rename in the fashion that you want. Ron

The ORIGINAL version used CoCo screen control codes to work.  I don't think
there was ever a termcap version done.  I hacked it up and released it to use
the Level II windows codes and cleaned it up a bit to get it to work better
than before.  It still has bugs, but not nearly as many as when I first got it
(grin).

Michele,

I have a ttyset utility, that will t(set the terminal type on a port, based on

Kreider's mtsmon for OS9, which, as far as I know, was never released for the
CoCo because the stock ACIAPAK driver didn't support the required system calls.

I've only used the earlier versions of Sled, I don't know anything about a
termcap xDversion. The same goes for dEd, I don't know of a termcap version,
although that doesn't mean there isn't one!

Named pipes were in the upgrade, I've never heard of any other attempt to write
named pipes for LII.

Well, I got my 68340 upgrade board two weeks ago, made the new boot disk, no
problem doing the boot disk...    Then I oppend up the MM1, removed the 68070
chip, the roms, replaced the pall chips with the faster chips supplied,  pluged
in the 68340 upgrade board, set the wait state pins, replaced the I/O board,
and powerd up the MM1, and got exactly NOTHING, the MM1 was dead...   No screen
no drive lights, Nothing!   So I reinstalled the old  CPU (68070) and the old
ROMS, but left in the new palls, reset the wait state, reassembled the whole
thing and powered up the MM/1 again, wholla it booted up No problem...

So I reinstalled the 68340 board and ROMM's again, and still NOTHING!  On
axamining the 68070 socked where the new board plugs in, and it looks like the
traces of the plug on the 68340 board plug dont meet the contact of the socked,
the traces are a little recessed a little in plastic fins, and cant make
contact with the new board...

The old 68070 chip's contacts are curled and stand of the ship a little, and
they go in the the recessed fins to make contact in the socket's contacts, the
contacts on the 68340 board's plug must also stand off about 2 milimeters to
make cantact with the sockets contacts...

But the board I got had contats on the boards plug that where imbetted flush,
and could not make the required contact for proper operation...

BlackHawk Enterprises is sending me a new 68340 board, hope that will plug in
proper...

Kevin Pease installed my board. He did a "destructive" upgrade to the socket
the '070 had been in. It has little plastic standoffs mounted inside it so the
'070's contacts will make contact with the socket. But the "plug" for the '340
accel board HAS to go ALL the way down! So he clipped out the stanoffs so the
accel board would go all the way down. Pease said that if I ever wanted to go
back to the '070, I'd have to mount some kind of standoffs in there. But, mine
is working OK and there ain't no reason why I'd want to go back to the '070!!!

I thought some of you might be interested in this press release I found in
'Electronic Design', Oct 4/93....

Taking aim at hyper-embedded, hard real-time applications, version 3.0 of the
Microware's OS-9 operating system has a preemptible kernel, faster interrupt
response and context switching, and more efficient interprocess communication
mechanisms. The OS upgrade also has improved determinism, enhanced
memory-management facilities, and greater overall system call throughput.

For resource-limited embedded applications, Microware has the Atomic OS-9
runtime microkernel, 20% smaller and 15% faster than the standard v3.0 kernel,
yet upwardly compatible. The microkernel has a subset of the functions in the
OS-9 v.3 kernel, excluding development and debugging support...

Version 3.0 supports system-state preemption...

Microware to improve determinism [sic] has added system-state preemption to the
OS core I/O file managers. It also has a new "buddy" memory allocator,
assigning memory on a more predictable block size basis rather than on a
"first-fit" basis.

The v3.0 kernel's fast IRQ system call (F$FIRQ) .... cut the interrupt latency
in half--to 3.0us--by preforming partial register save...

[pricing info follows]...
