  HI all,
 
 I saw people talking about using the joystick port on the MM/1 and I
remembered that I had written a routine in 68000 assembler, based on the C
code from Warren's BBS. Try it out in your own programs, it seems to work
quite well. (Although I noticed that the Tandy Deluxe joystick I have doesn't
return linear values...the x/y values w3increase non-linearly...are they all
like that?)

Hi all,
 
 I noticed some people were talking about using the joystick on the MM/1.
 I wrote some code to do this in assembler awhile ago, based on the C code
from
 Warren's board. Try it out..
 
 By the way, I noticed that my Tandy Deluxe joystick's x/y readings do not
 increase linearly when I move the joystick..they 'jump' quite a bit. Is this
 normal? (ie., the progression from 0 to 128 is not at a steady rate).

[37mDate    : 93/11/12  10:42:00[36m

        You mentioned somebody who doesn't like OS9000 and won't use it 
much.
        I have a '386 "clone" system and at present not much money.  If 
somebody would like to sell their OS9000 package for peanuts, I'd be 
interested.  Wasn't Microware doing a $300(or so) show special within 
the year?  I think I could swing a $150 offer without too much trouble. 
If more were insisted on, I could scrape and hustle... maybe.
  
        In spite of the nay-sayers, I was attracted into this 
environment because I saw the inherent superiority of this operating 
system, in spite of the lack (at that time) of personal-user 
applications.  In OSK, as reported in this echo, we now have MORE 
software than was available in OS-9 Lv.2, much of what has been 
available for Un*x, and an increasing number of programs that can 
handle the data-files of popular MS-DOS applications.
        A friend of mine who is an Amiga-user gave me some strong 
encouragement, remembering when the Amiga had very little software and 
tracing the growth of that environment.  He didn't claim great 
familiarity with the OS-9 environment, but after some discussion, he 
compared it pretty closely with the Amiga operating system, and said 
that with the flexibility and functionality of various 68xxx-based 
machines, we could eventually emulate MSDOS, run in Macintosh mode (and 
I infer, eventually, in Amiga mode). 
        We have the advantage of not being committed to a particular 
hardware manufacturer, or even a particular design platform.
  
        My-brother-the-expert keeps telling me that I ought to move 
back into the "mainstream", meaning, whatever a lot of people have been 
talked into buying.  I'm still interested in using an operating system 
that'll actually do the job better, even if I can only act as a 
cheerleader for the folks who're doing the software development.
  
        I see more _hope_ and more _patience_ in this environment than 
I have in most churches.  Because we KNOW the capabilities of this OS, 
we've been more patient with delays of hardware delivery et cetera than 
any other group of customers I've ever observed.
  
        I intend to "hang in here" with this environment and make as 
much use of it as I can.

Warren,
        I have a 3-Meg-RAM system, and boot from a floppy.  I have

Hugo,
     I recall Mark Griffith had a working pkg that connected to Internet 
or UUCP but don't know if it was for release or sale.  In the meantime I 
will recheck the docs I have on Binkley as I recall seeing a mention
that other networks (like UUCP and Internet) could be contacted for mail 
transfer.
    In the meantime leave mail to John A Donaldson and ask him how his
port is progressing.

Clyde,
      You can get the bootroms (allows booting from a HD) from Blackhawk 
since you are a rep.  I can order for you but then you pay my markup.
I have them in my 'orderform.txt' in my MM/1 official download section.
      In addition if you are having trouble getting your system current
to the latest serial, floppy, and Hd modules and window modules you can
send me 2 formatted 3.5" 1.44 meg floppies and I will send back copies
of the official update disk and my simplified bootlist and boot module
directory (boot48).  Please include $5.00 for S/H.
      BTW the M68340 CPU Upgrade includes new ROMS that allow booting
from the HD.

Well,
    Joystick control seems to be the unanimous winner, so now I'll have
to spend some time seeing if I can get it to work. And judging by the
slow response time I'm currently getting from the keyboard, the joystick 
might be my only hoper.

Paul,
    The joystick is definitely preferrable. I was just wondering how
many people were willing to work around the backplate problem on some
MM/1's to be able to use the joystick.
    Apparently the backplate problem isn't nearly as prevalent as I
thought it was, and even for those experiencing it, they're more willing 
to work around the problem than settle for keyboard control.
...Eric...

  Hi Malcolm, I bought the OSK in Toronto from a dealer who was selling

Further to my reply to you re the ST and OSK please excuse the missing
letters and spelling in parts, my dos box keyboard was acting up here.
   You probably saw the Cumana ad. from what you say but it's a great
package at that sell out price, no upgrades beyond v2.3.I believe it
includes Sculptor, Stylagraph and C, Basic09 and assembler as
applications.The manual is well written in as much as they add to the
standard Microware package with installation details, upgrade details
and a good general introduction to OSK.
   Apart from my original package by TLM, the buggy v1.2 who made a
good attempt at providing helpfull info' in addition to the Microware
doc., the other Microware manuals (later versions) don't come close.
I've never seen mm1 doc so that could be good in that respect also I
suppose.

Jesse,
        That's great news!  I've been frustrated with the almost-but- 
not-quite ANSI on the MM/1, and have been intrigued with what I've read 
about RIP and seen in demonstrations.  From the looks of a raw RIP 
file, it looks like something that ought to port to OSK easily.  I 
remember seeing files on the RIP standards, and _might_ have already 
downloaded them.  I'll doublecheck my IN directory, and upload 'em 
_after_ I repackage them to LZH.  (If I have 'em, they're in PKZip2.)
  
        I DON'T like using my clone as a front end for OSK 
communications, but until OSKers can "inflate", I guess we're stuck. 
The ironic thing to me is that for textfiles, which is what I do most 
of my fileswapping with, LHA compresses 'em tighter than PKZip2 most of 
the time anyway.  (...Aarrrgghh!...)
  
        Having RIP in OSK is something I'll look forward to.  But 
PLEASE, leave room for keyboard-only operation without _requiring_ a 
mouse.  I HATE mice, and I don't have a trackball yet, for either 
machine.
  
        I'm glad you're on our team.

Clyde,
     I downloaded the standards for RIP Graphics, quite impressive
actually.  Basic requirements are EGA video mode (640x350x16) with
a 64 color pallett.... I don't know if the MM/1 can support that
completely or not, but should come close, and of course it would
be easy on the System IV.  It does bother me that it requires a
bitmap screen, as I have always thought even ANSI was slow when it
really starts putting up some kind of psuedo-graphics and with RIP
graphics and the use of circles, and other kinds of graphics I just
know I will feel it is really slow ..... I guess you pays for them
nice graphics!
    I will implement RIPTERM and logon to some RIP supporting BBS
to see for myself what it looks like ..... as far as coding it into
a comm program, I don't think it would be ha but basically it would
start with a comm program running in a bitmap screen, instead of a
hardware text screen.  I downloaded RIPTERM 1.35 so will try it out.
    Let you know how it goes.

Gee I guess I'll have to bite the bullet and call Cumana. 
(International rates! *shudder*)  I was trying to organize a group buy

GOOD LUCK!  I'll be waiting impatiently for your results... Trying to
get my MM/1 and modem to talk to each other in the meantime.  (*sigh*)

Tim,
    It has been light traffic for last few weeks.  I guess all the MM/1
owners are happy and have no problems anymore !
    I noted the date on your msg was Nov. 23 which means your end was
slow getting out to the stars !  Most mail I have been getting lately
has only a one day lag.
    BTW are you still interested in beta testing Binkley on your MM/1 ?

All MM/1 owners:
The 4 Meg memory hack is a reality.  I am using a hacked board now.
If you would also like to be able to use 4 Meg SIMMs on your current
MM/1 I/O board and not have to buy a new backplane to get more memory,
this is the way.
There are two ways to get the hack.  One is to ask me and I'll email
you the steps necessary.  TAKE HEED!  THIS IS NOT A TRIVIAL HACK!!
Unless you are very skilled in doing this sort of thing, you can do
permanent damage to your I/O board and make is useless.
The other method is to let me do it for you.  For a $50 fee, I'
will perform the hack, test it, and warrenty the work for 1 year.
If anyone is interested, please let me know.  You can reach me here,
or on CIS as 76070,41 or on Delphi as MARKGRIFFITH.
Take care....Happy Holidays to all!

Mark,
     I have a few questions.
1.  You stated this is a 4 mrg Hack.  Does this mean for 4 meg simms or
    that the simms can be used as 1 meg or 4 meg and can be mixed giving 
    6 meg total memory ?
2.  Will  the hack be compatable with the M68340 CPU Upgrade ?
3.  Is there any change necessary in the Boot ?
4.  Do you have a spare I/O board so this can be done on an exchange
    basis ?
5.  What type, speed 4 meg simms will work and can you supply ?
 
     And finally, yes I am interested and you can leave details here in
my E-Mail msg. base (private).
     BTW I am testing a alpha/beta version of Binkley on my MM/1 and it
has the ability to spawn a BBS of most any kind.  Do you have a working
version of UUCP that could be incorporated.  It can mail to any net
including, of course, Fido.

Funny you should mention that!  We had a similar problem here a while
back.  It was solved when a message was sent outbound from the BBS in
the message base.  Weird, huh?  It's an awful remedy, entering messages
in stagnent bases (or IS it?), but it works!  Malcolm

John,
     I tried calling you both Sat. and Sun. but no answer. Anyway I have 
got Bink working on my MM/1 ok, In fact I am using now as a term program 
over a null modem to my RiBBS second copy at 9600 baud.  I have a few
questions;
1.  The help is from 'alt h' not 'alt 0'.
2.  The up/download is from page down/up key not shift up/dn.
3.  The capture mode is 'alt c'
4.  The log file now seems to work 'alt l' as similar to capture.
    I guess my main question is; is the help file hardcoded and are
you going to fix. And as for the address, boss node etc stuff I can put
a copy of my binkley.cfg for you to download if you want.  What did you
mean by "Boss Mail Mode - only partial. Doesnt dial out" will it receive? 
And one more important thing I discovered about binkley.cfg ;
The port address must be one number higher than the one being used. ie;
'PORT 4' is port /t3 and 'PORT 1' is port /t0.  That one was discovered
after a lot of messing around !!!

This hack allows you to use 4 Meg SIMMs.  You can mix SIMMs.  You'll
have to have two 1 Meg SIMMs or two 4 Meg SIMMs.
Yes, there is a slightly different hack for an accelerated system.  If
you do the hack now, and then add an accelerator board, you'll have to
change it slightly.
Yes, you need to modify the init module slightly to let the system know
you are using more memory..
No, I don't have any spare I/O boards at the moment.  I will have soon
so someone could swap them and then return the loaner board.  However,
this would really limit my ability to get the boards out if everyone
wanted a loaner.
I can supply SIMMs if you need them.  No prices yet.  Should have some
today.  Any type of 4 Meg SIMM should work as long as the speed ratingg
fast enough, keeping in mind if you want to use an accelerator board
later on.
If you want to do the hack yourself, I'll send you the data via regualr
mail.  I don't recommend anyone doing it unless they have had a lot of
experience doing these type of things.
