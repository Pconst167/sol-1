Vincenzo,

I just now saw a message you posted a couple of months ago about using
Datacube & transputer boards with OS-9.

I can't be of any direct help, but might be able to track down other
Datacube users or ex-employees who are familiar with OS-9 use on that
system.  Unfortunately, I don't know anyone who uses transputers with
OS-9 -- and would expect that to be a fairly hairy project, though I have
no good reason for that assumption.

I used an early Datacube system with OS-9, and have kept in touch with
some of the folks there, and some who've moved around since.

I hope you have your problems resolved, but will help out if I can.

[As an aside, why didn't you go with a "real time Unix" like QNX or the
(Lynx Unix?)?  OS-9 has strengths, but is a very frustrating environment
to switch to from Unix.]

Sb: Call For Articles
Fm: Mark Griffith 76070,41
To:  All

                            CALL FOR ARTICLES

    As we startup the latest magazine for the CoCo/OS-9/OSK community,
    we are in need of quality articles from the users for publication.
    If you have ever felt you would like to write something that could
    be useful or informative to the rest of your friends in the CoCo
    and OS-9 worlds, please consider it again.

    We would like to begin receiving a steady inflow of articles from
    you, the readers.  There are no requirements other than a desire
    see your names in print and possibly help others.  Your article
    can be on any subject you desire as long as it is related to the
    computer world.  If you have something to say about MS-DOS machines
    (and is not inflammatory) you can write that too.  We will accept
    articles from anyone about anything that is fit for publication.

    It would be better if you limited your article to the scope of the
    magazine, which is the CoCo/OS-9/OSK communities.  We would like
    to see articles on hardware as well as software.  You may have
    discovered a new way to do something or to use a certain software
    package.  You may have a novel programming routine, or a full
    program that you would like to share.  We will consider anything
    you care to send in.

    Of course, anything you do send in is subject to the editorial pen
    (or, more appropriately, the DEL key) of the editor, Barbara.
    She will edit your articles for style, punctuation, and content if
    necessary.  But when it is printed, your name will go on the byline.

    If you'd like to submit something, please send it in as soon as you
    can.  The (noname as yet) magazine will be released on the first of
    each month.  If you send something in and it is too late for the
    current issue, it will go in the next.  If a number of people send
    in articles, we will publish them as we have space, so yours may be
    a couple issues in the future.  We will answer all submissions with
    either e-mail or regular US mail thanking you and letting you know
    if and when we will publish your submission.

    For the near future, we cannot offer anything in return for a
    submission except a free issue that has your article in it.  In
    the future (we don't know when) we will pay for submissions.  Look
    for an announcement in the magazine when this begins.

    If you would like to start a regular monthly column, please contact
    me.  You'll need to have an idea for the column and some sort of
    plan for it's flow over the next few issues.

    All submissions can be in electronic format and sent via e-mail to
    by Compuserve or Delphi accounts below:

    Compuserve: 76070,41
    Delphi    : MARKGRIFFITH
    Work      : mark@datapage.com

    If you'd like to send in a typed article or a disk, send it to:

    DccS (for now and until the mag gets a name)
    1368 Old Hwy 50 East
    Union, MO 63084

    Letters to the editor can be sent to the same address, except send
    them to the attention of Barbara Griffith.

    Thanks!

Sb: get pwd in "C"
Fm: David Breeding 72330,2051
To:  76510,2203

  Some time ago, someone - and to the best of my recollection it was you...
asked about how to get the current working directory for usage by a program.
This was something that I was also interested in, but as I remember, no one
came up with a really elegant way of doing it.
   Of course, I suppose that by now, you probably have resolved the problem in
some way, I think that I have stumbled across a pretty acceptable solution.
  Last night, in reviewing "OS9 Insights", in the section on pipes, the answer
was there.  I'm using OSTerm and don't have an ASCII upload ability, so I'll
just briefly go over the algorithm.  I'm using a CoCo, not yet having graduated
to OSK, but most things should be similar.. Here goes..

  int savout,pippth,pthsz;

 pippth=open("/pipe",READ+WRITE);
 savout=dup(1); close(1); dup(pippth);
 os9fork("pwd"....);   from "INsights", OSK calls it a little differently
      from OS9
 pthsz = readln(pippth,wdir,sizeof(wdir)) (Wdir is defined as char wdir[?]
 wdir[pthsz-1] = '\0';   to get rid of cr sent by pwd
  .....cleanup....

  As I said, this may be too little too late, but it seems to be a pretty neat
solution.

I was the one that uploaded it.  The problem is with the extended headers you
create an archive with it toggled off (e option), then there will be no
problems with any other system reading the archive.  The author is aware of the
problem and he is working on a new version that will fix the header problem as
well as include additional features (I'm hoping for a move function and for it
to archive directories.

Hi Ken!
       Thank you for the reply. I have great hopes for LZH down the road.
 I'll give the (e) option a shot and see how the IBM public likes it.

Sb: #NFS Problems
Fm: Paul Maynard 100033,512
To: ALL

Hi Everyone,
I'm developing some software that operates as a diskless NFS client and
using a local Sun Workstation as the NFS server.  I have created all the
expected Group and User ID mapping files and while I can create, open, read,
write and delete files on the Sun, when I try and rename them I get a error
214, implying I didn't own it. This is particularly annoying as the same had
previously created the file. (I was updating a file, by copying and modifying
entries from the original to a new created one.
The Sun reports that I (as a Unix user) own the files. OS9's dir command
reports me as the owner, so what gives???
Any help will be gratefully accepted.

Paul Maynard.

Hmm - if you owned them at both ends, did you have WRITE permissions turned on
at the target end for the file in question?

Kevin,

        I bought BGFX from IMS at the 1992 ChicagoFest. At that time there
weren't any docs written up for it. I understand that now there is. I would
very much like to get my hands and these. What would be the best way. Can you
send them Email or should I send you a disk with return postage? My son is
taking a interest in basic and would like to do some things using BGFX.

Thanks

Bill,

        Something for you to check out. I zapped some messages from my message
base, things like the entry screen, and then I selected the reorganize option.
It started to sort through file and then went into the process stage. I then
got a 103 bus error. I restarted ix and tried to read messages in that base
using 'a' option. Again I got the 103 error.
