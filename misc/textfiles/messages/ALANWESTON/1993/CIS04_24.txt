                       Announcing a New Magazine for the
                          CoCo/OS-9/OSK Communities


    Beginning on 1 May, a new publication will debut at the Chicago
    Fest.  This magazine will be my attempt to bring together the CoCo
    OS-9 and OSK communities under one publication and try to give all
    the readers the articles, columns, and departments they have been
    asking for over so many years.  This magazine will serve the
    CoCo, OS-9 and OSK communities equally.  Advertisers for products
    geared for each of these areas will be contacted.  Column writers
    you are familiar with will be there.  Articles that you would like
    to see will be written.  In short, I hope to make this magazine
    what none of the others have done, and to pick up where The
    Rainbow left off.

    The magazine is unnamed at this point, which is where you, the
    potential readers come in.  The first issue will announce the
    "Name that Mag" contest.  The contest rules are this:  You send
    in your entry for the magazine name via e-mail or US mail,
    including your name and address with your entry.  All entries must
    be received before the 15th of May.  In the next (June) issue of
    the unnamed magazine, the top 5 selections will be announced.
    Voting for the winner will then commence in the same manner as
    the entries were made, e-mail or snail mail.  The winner by the
    popular vote will be announced in the July issue.  The winner will
    also receive a set of Labtec Stereo Computer speaker and a free
    one year subscription.  The runner-up will also receive a free
    one year subscription as well as some other goodies to be announced
    later.

    Starting with the May issue, the new magazine will be offered free
    to anyone who wants a copy, and will continue on with three more
    free issues.  After that time, I and my wife (who will be the
    managing editor) will decide if enough user responses were made to
    warrant continuing with the effort.  At the same time, the readers
    can decide if what they had seen so far was worth their time and
    money.  If we both want to continue, then, at that point,
    subscriptions will be gathered and a new magazine, mandated by the
    community members, will be born.

    The first issue will be very small and subsequent issues will grow
    as support grows.  I believe when the first four issues are done,
    we all will have a better idea of what direction this publication
    will take.  I sincerely hope that the reader response is large
    enough to show support for continuing.  I think we can make this
    magazine something that the readers would be proud of.

    Submissions for the contest can be sent to the following:

Minor little glitch in the handling of the subject field.

I used the <T> option to nab your PPn from my current messages. Chnaged the

Seems that an over type doesn't clear the field. Should it?

Steve,

That's the way its supposed to work, sort of. The field is available for
editing, you can backspace, and delete the previous character, or type over any
existing character, using left and right arrow keys (from termcap) to move back
and forth. You should be able to space over everything, trailing blanks get
stripped. This is something that has always been there, but never worked right.
I would really like to get it to work a little better, but was afraid to make
any more changes so close to the 'fest. What do you think? Should I put it back
to no editing, where it just blanks out what's there when you start typing?

Its the same for all the fields, and I have had to edit the To: line for long
Internet addresses, that were too long when the name at the end in quotes was
included. So rather than have to write down the long internet address, and then
only type in what is needed, you can just space over the part at the end that
you don't need. I also realize that it can be a pain this way, particularly for
the subject field. I'm open to suggestions, but don't want to have to make too
many changes now.

To: All

                                                Introducing InfoXpress

        There are a number of communications services, bulletin boards, and
        other online activities competing for your hard earned money these
days.
        If you want to remain current on the ongoing activities, you must spend
        long hours at your computer keyboard laboriously logging into each
        service one-at-a-time.  Once there, you either read and reply to the
        message base online, or figure out some method to download it, then
        compose your replies offline, only to log in again to upload them.

        This takes up much of your valuable time.  It also costs you money for
        connect time and, in many cases, long distance charges.  You also have
        the headache of keeping track of who said what on what service and
their
        different usernames or IDs.  If you want to keep a history of all the
        downloaded messages, you need to devise a scheme to do this yourself.
        Many long time modem users are finding it less and less enjoyable
        because of these problems.

        To answer these concerns, Bill Dickhaus, long time Compuserve user and
        Assistant Sysop, wrote InfoXpress.  This software, developed over many
        years of listening to user complaints and wishes, includes almost every
        feature you could want in a communications package.

        InfoXpress allows you the setup your OS-9 or OSK machine to
        automatically call both Delphi and Compuserve at any time during the
day
        or night, or several times each day.  Each time a connection is made,
        InfoXpress will search through each forum you have previously specified
        and download all the unread messages.  In addition, InfoXpress will
grab
        all your waiting electronic mail, and automatically upload any replies
        you have made to messages or e-mail from a previous online session.
        Once your messages are captured, you can view them and create replies
        using your favorite editor.

        InfoXpress also keeps track of all the messages it has downloaded and
        will automatically ``age'' the message database at periodic intervals
        keeping the most current messages in an active status while archiving
        the older ones.  InfoXpress maintains a separate database of user names
        for each service and allows you to update it while reading messages,
        using the currently displayed message header as the source for the
        information.  A log of your online sessions as well as a usage database
        is also kept allowing you to calculate your online charges.

        All the features of InfoXpress are fully customizable using any text
        editor.  In addition, all features of Delphi and Compuserve are
        supported, including Internet addressing and binary mail.  In short,
        InfoXpress is the answer to all the frustrations of online
        communications.

        InfoXpress is available exclusively from DccS.  To check availability
        or to get more information, call or write to:

OK....the obvious questions, did you do and os9gen on the hard drive to setup
the bootfile?  The SCSI ID of the drive should be zero so that seems to be
correct.

Thanks Mark. I have checked the Bootfile a number of times. I even checked LSN0
with ded just to make sure. Yup...it is there.

Funny thing about the boot processes. After the floppy fails (no disk, etc)
then the system seems to hang. However, if I attach a LED to the scsi activity
pins on the i/o board I do get a regular pulse. It seems that the ROMs are
trying to find the HD...but it appears to be busy or something.

Any other ideas?

Can I throw in a pennyworth or two?  It's not so difficult breaking up a
program; you quite often have to do it even when you're alreading using a
modular approach, as components get too big.

Simplest way is to start with procedures that are relatively self-contained
(that don't use too many static variables).  Take out a bunch of these, say all
the math ones into "mymath.c" and the string handlers into "mystrings.c" - get
the picture?  It's also a good idea to put all static variables into their own
program module - saves hunting later.  By the time you've done this, each
module will probably be down to a reasonable size.

Next thing is to create "mydefs.h".  Into this go all system #includes,
prototypes for all functions that are known outside their own modules, all
static variables (defined as extern), custom typedefs, etc.  Include this
header at the start of each of your program modules so every module has a
common frame of reference.

Lastly, the make file.  It looks something like this:

# Make file to produce "myprog"

RDIR     =  RELS
ODIR     =  CMDS

LIBDIR   =  /dd/LIB
CFLAGS   =  -ix

DEFDIR   =  /dd/DEFS
HFILES   =  $(DEFDIR)/stdio.h\
            $(DEFDIR)/ctype.h\
            $(DEFDIR)/modes.h\
            $(DEFDIR)/errno.h\
            mydefs.h

RFILES   =  $(RDIR)/myprog.r\
            $(RDIR)/mystatics.r\
            $(RDIR)/mymath.r\
            $(RDIR)/mystrings.r

$(ODIR)/myprog:  $(RFILES)
            cc $(CFLAGS) -fd=$(ODIR)/myprog $(RFILES)

$(RFILES):  $(HFILES)

Save it as "makefile", then all you need to type is "make" to do a full or
partial rebuild as necessary.  The script assumes makefile is in the same
directory as the source files.

I just read on and see you've already solved the problem.  Oh well, my fault
for jumping in before finishing reading messages.  Might as well leave it in
now.

This business of breaking up programs is probably more art than science. One
can build some nice safety nets by declaring functions as static...that way
stuff in other files can't find them.

I might as well add in my method of declaring global variables in a common
h file. In the file containing main() I do a

        #define MAIN

Then in the .h file (which is included in all the files) I have:

        #ifndef MAIN
        #define GLOBAL extern
        #else
  #define GLOBAL
        #endif

To declare/define a variable I just do:

        GLOBAL char foo;

This will define foo in main.c; and declare it in the other files.

Hope this helps someone.

If the / falls as the first character of a line, then the CIS editor thinks
it's a command and attempts to process what follows. That's probabbly what
happened.

Have you attempted to use login from the command line? Type Login and login as
one of your test users. What happens?

Also ... who owns login and tsmon?

I tried the login from shell command line. Same thing...however, this time it
adds 'error 214' to the 'can't chd to...' message. So, yes, it is a permission
thingie. But if it works for you....

Hey Bob,

You said that /dd/usr/steve had perms of d----ewr right?  Now, is it OWNED by
steve?  You may have to do a chown to steves UID.

Hope this helps,

Opps, I got the names confused on the last message. I didn't realize that Mike
had stepped into this thread.

Boy, do you ever know how to make a fellow feel dumb! Now why would I want to
make the user the owner of this own directory? <blush>

You hit it right on the head! Thanks for all the patience.

But, that brings up an interesting topic? How do you change the owner of a
directory? I have several different versions of chown. They all refuse to work
on a directory...they work fine on files. And I can't have the user create his
own directory....sort of defeats the whole purpose. I can't, as superuser,
change to 'Steves' ID either (or is there a command for that?

I ended up using ded to directly modify the descriptor...but that really seems
to be the hard way! Guess I could modify the password file so that I log into a
public directory (as the user), create the new directory, logout, modify the
password file again....there has to be an easier way!

Bob,
Check your cmds dir for chown. Microware has one there. It is really flaky,
but changes user id if you are logged in as superuser.

Thanks Bob. I have a number of chown's. I don't believe any of them come from
MW. However, the fildes Steve suggested does the job just fine.

Hey hey!  Success!

Glad Mike's suggestion finally nailed down this problem. I was fast running out
of ideas.

To change ownership, I use the 'fildes' utility that was shipped with my MM/1.
Does ownership and a couple of other things.

Bob,

What's the perms on /dd/usr ...

It need to be full access so the user can get to his directory.

Bill,
   Just to let you know, I finally figured out how to break these C programs up
and link them later. I was pulling my hair out for the last couple of days,
with all these <unresolved reference> errors. I could not figure out what the
problem was. As a last resort, I pulled out the Kernigham & Ritchie book, and
there it was. I had defined all the global variables in the main module, as
STATIC. Somewhere I had gotten the idea that variables defined outside a
function, and defined as static, were global. Static & Extern, just don't mix.
  So now I can get back to finishing this program up, without worrying about
bumping into that 64k limit,(hopefully).

Larry,

It took me a long time to understand all the ins and outs of C variable
definitions. Part of my confusion was that static means something different
whether the variable is defined outside or inside a function. The concept of
what a global variable really is, and how extern and the linker fit into the
picture was also something that I didn't understand at first. Its good to hear
that you got it working.

We are running CUMANA os9 (V2.3) on an ATARI STE and are looking for a
serial driver (RS232) for the MODEM 2 and/or SIO 2 Ports. Is there
anybody who has implemented or sells them or is there any other type
of information available on this subject ?
