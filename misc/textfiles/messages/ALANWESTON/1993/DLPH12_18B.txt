1. The Bad News:  Ghostscript doesn't do simple ASCII text files.
Anything fed to Ghostscript must be in the PostScript language.

2. The Good News:  There are a couple of excellent programs available
to convert text into PostScript.  LOUT will produce just about any
document style you want - it is a large program, with lots of features.
PSF is a simpler program to take simple ASCII text and output PostScript.

More?
Both should be available in the databases.

3. I wrote a program called CirCad that draws diagrams on the MM1 and
outputs PostScript code to a file that can be fed to Ghostscript
or a PostScript printer.  There is a demo in the databases, (but the
PostScript output is not in it) -- MARKGRIFFITH (Dirt Cheap Computer
Stuff) distributes the complete program.

Back again with another (dummie) ghostscript question. Got ghostscript
set up and have printed a number of the sample files including the
golfer and tiger. Now what do I do when I want to print some of my
own files? Say a simply ASCII text file? I guess I need the exact
ghostscript command because I sure cant find anything in all those docs.
Also, is there a way using the MM1 to create a postscript file (.ps)

This is really the offer MM/1 owners should be seeking.  Why go with an
unsupported, outdated version of G-Windows??  It goes against the very
reasons most of us want to get the port... so we can develop mainstream
graphical applications.  I continue to support the Delmar port.

Thanks, Ed.   By the way, while I appreciate Frank Hoggs effort to bring
G-Windows to the MM/1 - I beleive that the MM/1 community will benefit more
from a fully supported port , not a semi-supported version.  I stand firmly
with Ed Gresick on this one.
Keep up the good fight guys!

I followed some of the threads here about your putting together a cheap
OSK system. I'm interested in a system I can slowly assemble such as
described in your last issue of TWO68M. Are you proposing a complete system
in the near future?

Hi Zack!!

 I use Mplay to convert WAV to IFF. I beleive (sp) that you need to lie and
tell it that the data is RAW. Let me know if you need more.

Lout is overkill to dump a simple, purely ASCII text file to a printer using
Postscript. Here is a program I wrote to do this. To create a Postscript
program to print an ASCII text file named foo.bar, you need to merge this
Postscript program with the data file and tack on a CNTL/D at the end.
Like this:

$ merge pstext.ps foo.bar >foo.bar.ps
$ display 4 >+foo.bar.ps

You can then print the Postscript file foo.bar.ps with Ghostscript. This
is also overkill, IMHO, since surely the printer you are using can accept
the pure ASCII text file on its own, right?

More?
Anyway, you can also print this file to a Postcript printer by doing a:

$ merge foo.bar.ps >/p

This Postcript program shades the paper with a technique that makes the
paper look like "green bar" paper. This shading may not look so good
on a dot matrix printer. In which case, search`tarough the program for
the comment on how to disable the green bar printing and follow the
directions.

One thing to remember. When you extract pstext.ps from this message, make
sure that there are NO blank lines after the last line, charloop, as
EVERYTHING which comes after that line will be taken as input and a blank
line will make everything you print start on line two on the first page.
