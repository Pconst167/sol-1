Fm: David Breeding 72330,2051
To: ALL

TO ALL WHO HAVE DOWNLOADED RMAPAT.AR:

I have been informed of a bug in my patch to "r63".  The tfr's & exg's using
the "W" register did not seem to work.  For a quick fix, change the byte at
offset $179B from $0e to $10..

The new CRC should be $77B166.

If anyone has any more bug reports, please let me know and I will upload a new
patcfile.

..Sorry!!!!

Regarding the patch to "r63"...
   (change byte @ $179b from $0e to $10) If you have uploaded this anywhere,
would you please pass this patch along?
  Also, The CRC above is for an otherwise unmodified version.

No, I've not tried any of the 14400 nodes...I don't think that making an
international call would compensate for the speed increase. However, I can't
wait till my Vancounver node gets "fully" converted!

Ian -

Just a wild thought here...  Are you running with Shellplus?  I wonder if, by
any chance, the new version of 'ar' is being bitten by the same memory
allocation problems that affected 'kbcom' and earlier versions of Ultimuse?

If you are using Shellplus, you could try using dEd on the original Shell to
change its internal name to something different (I used "ohell"), then save it
in your CMDS directory under this name.  Then try executing:

      [shellplus]: ohell ar1.92 -u testfile

and see if it works.  (I can't try it here because my CC3 is crippled.)

Carl,

I just retested the latest version, and just by accident duplicated Ian's
results. In my case, I really was out of memory, only 40K free. The 216 error
is a little confusing though. I haven't had time to do anything more than a few

        YAOQ (Yet Another OS-9 Question):

        I installed Shell + in my CoCo III under OS9LII, and there are a LOT of
things I like using it rather than the stock shell included in the original
package.... specially the p="[$] " method to include the current data drive in
the prompt line... trouble is that I did include the statement in my Startup
file: here and there as a matter of fact... but when the system ends the
booting process, all I get is the Term prompt, I have to setup the prompt again
from the command line..... am I missing something here?

I did a quick test of ar1.92 and found the same problems as others reported.
But, I also found a solution <g>. The problem is that these testers were using
shell+. And shell+ forks all programs with (as I recall) a min. of 8K stack
memory. However, if you switch to the standard shell all works fine. I have a
copy of the MW shell on in my cmds renamed to tshel just for these kinds of
problems. Hope this helps.

Jeeyiminy, Bob... first message I leave here in over a year, and you managed to
"scoop" me by an hour and a half!

After installing the InfoXpress upgrade, I decided to try setting it up for
CompuServe as well.  We'll see how the Bell Canada bill goes...

OK, you and Bob and Steve are all correct; shell+ is the problem. I dug out the
original shell and renamed (and patched) it to tshel and ar1.92 now works fine.
Mind you, on text files "ar -u" and "ar -ub12" seem to give archives exactly
the same size. May be better on binaries.

Conveniently, ar is comfortably short (by more than the length of tshel) of
16K-512, so I merged it with tshel. Pre-loading ar for an archiving session now
allows the use of "tshel ar ...." without constantly exercising the floppies.
Of course, I left another copy of tshel in the cmds directory for the times I
just type "tshel ar" without loading it first. Too bad there is no convenient
way to just be able to type "ar". One of shell+'s minor shortcomings is that it
doesn't let shell scripts pass command line parameters to one or more
variables. This is a feature I use heavily in MSDOS shell. (Or does it? Have I
missed anything?) Hmmmm... I don't suppose ALIAS allows the use of a space in a
pseudo module name; that would be convenient.

You might try putting a loopback on the ports and see if anything you type is
echoed back.  Just short pins 2 and 3 and fire up Sterm and type away. If you
get nothing back, then the 68681 is probably bad.

Mark,
   I should have taken this first message off the board, I found the problem.
The MM1 is A-OK, I had a bad MC1488 IC in this Zoom modem. I replaced it, and
it works fine now.
  I'll make a note about that shorting of pins 2 & 3 together as a test, I
never even thought of that.
  Thanks Mark

Hey, John...hang in there! Just 'cause someone doesn't agree with your ideas,
well that shouldn't be a big deal. Seems that choice of programming language
and what should/should not be in a program is held by many of us with a
religious zeal. And in the fervor we sometimes end up turning on the flames.

It appears that program size may become more important...all the other programs
are getting so large we have to find ways to cut in other places...either that
or do the easy thing of getting more memory. Fun.

John,

    I just downloaded your Circadd program, it looks good, I'll be sending you
an order.

    The real reason for the message is that I see you were also bit by the line
drawing bug in KWindows. I also ran into this problem of non-uniform boxes in
some of the programs where I wanted to draw a grid. I didn't find a solution,
but I did find a fix that would work in some cases.

   The fix involves using the LSet function. Don't ask me why, but with
 LSet = 0, you can't draw a uniform grid, but by setting LSet to 1 or 2
 the grid lines come out uniform.

 The way I use this is to:

       LSet(path, 1);              /* Set to AND (or 2 to OR) */

     /* Do line drawing here */

       LSet(path, 0);              /* Reset back to no logic  */

   The only problem with this method is that you sometimes run into different
color lines than you thought when you AND or OR with the background.
   Depending on the colors, this might or might not be a problem.

 I hope this helps
