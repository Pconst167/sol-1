I have just gotten my /T3 paddle board so my next set will be to pick up a 14.4
Fax/Modem. I was wondering if you guys could answer a few questions that I have
and thus keep me from pulling out what little hair I have left.

First off what are some modems that are currently being used with an MM/1. If
you could please give me make and model it would help.

Second there are some jumpers on the paddle boards. I know what they are for
from the docs but I am not sure as to why I would want to set them in either
manner. I could use some reasoning here please.

Thanks for the time and hopefully when I log back on next week I will be tring
out InfoXpress to find some answers to these questions.

I'm using a SupraFaxModem upto 14.4. I'd give it a fair rating, but wouldn't
purchase another until Supra fixes the current problems. (Lot's of problems
connecting with other modems)

Jumper P4 controls the setting for RTS and DTR. You'll need to set this to
toggle (rather than tied high) for use with a high speed modem. Also, the type
bit on /t3 or /t4 will need to be xmoded to 80.

Mark,

     I spoke to Gary Latham  today  and he said I should ship my I/O board to
you for repair.  I received it from IMS on 01/28/92 and had no problem
installing it.  However, the machine did (and still does) hang on boot with the
hard drive access LED on about half the time.  I called Paul about the problem
on 02/17/92  and told him that the WD33C93A SCSI chip had a #8 mask.  He said
the chip would probably have to be replaced.  He's been promising to ship me a
replacement I/O board  (and the hard drive I paid for) since that time.  I have
a Seagate ST138N-1 and a Quantum 105 in the MM/1 as well as the deluxe boot
ROM's.  Installing a boot on either drive and configuring it as /dd (/h0)
results in the fol- lowing message and results in a hung machine with the HD
LED on. Powering off and having a bootable floppy in /d0 on  power up is the
only way to get a successful boot (when it doesn't hang).

    OS-9/68K System Bootstrap

    Floppy disk drive not ready.
    Attempting to boot from Hard Disk.
    Attempting to boot from Rom.
    NO kernel found.
    Boot failed, error status $00F6

The hard drives had been os9gen'ed and had valid boot files on them.

Where should I ship the board and approximately how much will it cost me to get
the chip replaced?

Thanks in advance, Ernest Withers, MM/1 #120848

Two questions for the MM1:

1. What is a good setting for maxcount on the hard disk descriptor so that I
won't lose chars during modem sessions?

2. What are all the possible environment variable I can use?

Thanks,

Larry, Just a quick note to let you know that I got makpal. I did a quick run
though and it appears to be a neat little program. However: A PLEA to you and
all other mm/1 programmers. Please set up your programs so that they don't
bugger with the user's original screen. It is real easy to create a new screen
using /w and do all the displays and input on that screen...then when the
program is done, you just reselect the user's original screen and all is well.
I don't think it is just me...I really get upset when a program (any program!)
changes the color and/or size of the screen I have set up. PS. Don't take this
message as a flame! I like the program and your efforts!

Bob,
  That was on of the things that I have been fighting with all along.
 I wanted very badly to have the program do its thing, then when done, rest the
screen back to the original, but I could not come up with the way to do it.
   Everything I tried, just didn't work. I guess I was hoping that someone
would give some example on how to do it. I also couldn't figure out why in C I
couldn't do it like Basic09 on the CoCo. When you do a RUN gfx2("select")
basic09 would switch (or dup) all 3 paths, but the Select call in C doesn't, if
you do a Select(path2), the output is sent to path2 but it looks for input from
the original path. There is only one point in the program where it needs to get
input from the keyboard, but I couldn't figure out how to tell it to look at
path2 for input.
  I even tried to get the window info and color info, to save it, and when the
program is done, I would do a DWSet, and put the window back like it was.
  That didn't work either, the window would be put in a kind of half way mode,
it looked like an interlaced screen, when it should have been a non- interlaced
screen, but if you selected another screen, using the keyboard or mouse button,
then went back to the screen that looked interlaced, it was now correct.
  I know I'm not describing this very well, maybe I should upload some of the
test routines I have been trying.

  I would be grateful, if you had some examples that show how to do it right.

Larry,

After you do the final DWSet and get the fuzzy screen, you need to pause 1/2 a
sec or so, then Select(0);  This will take care of the 'fuzzy' screen.

TO get IO from wpath2 you can do a read(wpath2,buffer,length) or a
readln(wpath2,buffer,length);  Make sense?

I'm getting real frustrated...it happens every time I get some new disks or
download files from the unix world--I can't seem to print out the $*#*$% manual
pages. I've tried the various *off programs I have (mroff, troff, roff, proff)
and none of them seem to understand the various commands in the files. So,
either I don't have the right formatter for these files, or is it possible that
I need some kind of a header file to define common macros?

As an example, the file I has just now starts out with the following command
lines:

 .TH EXPECT 1 "30 March 1992"
 .SH NAME
 expect \- programmed dialogue with interactive programs
 .SH SYNOPSIS
 .B expect
 [

Sure looks like mroff-like stuff to me.

You nailed both items:

        a) They're n/troff files..
        b) They use the -MAN macro package (under unix)

Bob,

The manual pages arein troff format.  Nothing we have for OS9 will directly
print them.  You have to massage them by hand.  You could always upload them to
a UNIX site and print them to a disk file and then download them to your OSK
machine.

One good reason for working at a place that has UNIX machines (grin).

I think I have just the ticket for you.  I just finished playing with Mroff so
it'll except single char <.> dot commands and print most n/troff manual pages.
Added .q for quoting a string, .tr for transliterating chars, and more. I have
a macrofile also that will expand most the n/troff commands.

Even added a few options like:

 -s<num>        send Odd/Even pages only to stdout
                (0 = All pages, 1 = Odd, 2 = Even)
 -m<macrofile>  macro file to include in document
 -m             will check the env var MROMAC for the
                path to a macro file to be included.
 -t             use termcap for underline and bold
 -t<TERM>       where 'term' is the termcap entry to use
 -u             use terminal page length (use with -t)
                (Use file for piping thru 'more')

 mroff -m -u -t file

Would print the manual to the screen using Termcap codes for bold and underline
and format the document in screen sized pages, piping it thru more will work
also.

 mroff -m -tepson file >/p

Will use the termcap entry 'epson' to print the document to the printer.

Interested?  Think there is enough interest in it to upload it for public
consumption?  Maybe the name should be changed to nroff or something too?

   Thanks, it still needs some work to make it more professional, like the
