 myself am unfamiliar with RT-11 but there might possibly be someone over on
DELPHI who has some big machine experience.  OS9's shell (at least the standard
one) is not all that powerfull Perhaps one of the expanded shells would be
closer.  You are, I presume going to be doing this on a 68000 class machine?

are a few UNIX users around from DEC systems. VMS too)

It's unlikely...

On the bright side. the PDP-11's architecture and the 68000 are surprisingly
similar... I wonder if that had anything to do with the fact that MOTORLA used
a lot of PDP-11's in their radio/dispatch systems (I used to work for them)...

To: David Breeding 72330,2051

David. Thanks for the reply. Yes, calling pwd and shoving the output down a
pipeline will work well. Since I posed the question, I've rewritten my file
selector in ved/68000 so that it no longed does any chd()s...that means that
ved now has to keep track of relative pathlists. Still not the idea solution,
but it works well.

Using pipes to grab the output of standard os9 utilities is a very powerful and
useful technique. I tend to avoid it in commercial products: one can never be
sure that the utilities you _think_ are standard actaully generate the output
you expect; nor do all systems end up with the same set of "standard" utilities
(mind you, assuming pwd in Level II and pd in OSk would probably be safe...).

Thanks for the input.

Bob,

        I need a little help with something. I have a file that I am trying to
print out into 3 columns. The file has about 200 lines in it and each line is
26 characters long. I put the printer in condensed mode and I get thre columns
just fine except that the left column starts one line lower than the center and
right columns. What do I need to set to stop this? The lines in the file are:

co 3 \fc 100044               2.5000 100067               9.0000 104020
5.9000

the file continues like this till the end. I have tried putting
co 1 and the end to balance them out, which is does, but that first line is
still low.

Thanks,

 Keith Bauer

Keith, sounds like you might have an extra CR in your file?? If you send me a
part of your file (so that I can duplicate the error) I'll be glad to figure it
out. Easyiest to lha the file and put it in my mailbox. BTW, I can't really
figure this out from the message since CIS does its own linewrapping...If you
are posting info in which you want line breaks to remain, use the store
unformatted option or start each line with a blank.

 I will look for an extra line CR in the file. If I still can't get it to work
I will send you the file. Thanks for the hints on how to handle a text file
also.

Yes, permissions weren't the problem, except that NFS won't let OS9 rename
files by simply manipulating the directories.  I have to use I$SETSTT to
request the rename. I got this info from Microware as I had previously faxed a
query and their reply got to me that day after I posted the note on Compuserve.
Thanks for you thoughts.

Keith,

Would it be possible for you to send me the message file? So far I've been
unable to recreate the problem, but I'll keep working on it. It would help if I
could see what was causing the 103 error. You can either mail me the file,
using IX, or upload the file to any data library here and mark it to my
attention, thanks!

BTW, on CompuServe you can limit the fourm entry screens by specifying the
ForumEntry=flash option. This tells IX to only collect forum entry information
if there is a news flash, otherwise it collects nothing. This is not available
on Delphi. I'm considering (for a future release) alternate aging options for
different sections, including the automatic message section (where the forum
entry messages go).

Tony,

I saw your message to Kevin Darling about Kix\30 users. I just got one. You are
right it is a screamer.  I had been using a Hazelwood QT2 (68000, 10 Mhz).  The
68030 at 16 Mhz is a rocket by comparison.  I used to be able to take a break
during compiles but no more.  I have a Quantum LPS 120S running on it and that
helps it move along.  (My QT2 has an ST225N.)

The documentation is great except for the lack of a parts list and a
description of the switches on the 4s2p board.  I think, however, that I can
figure it out.

I also got Frank Hogg's load of PD software (Users Group, TOP, Sterm, Ispell
etc.) It is a great collection of programs. I have miles to go to figure out
what I have and use it all.

All in all I am delighted to have upgraded to a product which is more state of
the art.  (I look forward to receiving the Version 2.4 upgrade, too.)

Ken

To:  Bob van der Poel 76510,2203 (X)

Bob,

        I downloaded the newer unzip from here and I have a question for you. I
am using it with a QWK packet reader under OSK and it seems to handle the
conversion of CR LF=>LF differently than the older version that I have. When I
use the a option and then I list out the file it is not line up to the left. It
                                               goes
                                                    like
                                                         this across the
screen. If I leave off the a option it is lined up on the left but there is an
extra line feed. I believe that you where in on the port of this. If not maybe
you could direct me in the right direction.

Thanks

Yes, I did post the unzip. It was a real quick and dirty port (ie. I stopped
when it appeared to work and I got my files unpacked). Don't know about QWK.
From the description in your message it appears that line feeds are NOT being
deleted from the file. Hmmm, just looked at the source. It appears that the
LF/CR translation is converting a LF/CR pair to a LF (this is how unix likes it
files). I had a quick look...and don't see a real easy fix...I'll have a look
later this weekend and see what I can come up with. For now, you can just use
TR to convert LFs to CRs....

Hey Bob,

I did the same thing with Lha(rc) It's pretty simple. Just save the last char
you are putting to the file.  If you get a LF don't output anything, then on
the next char, check it the last one was a LF, if the current char is a CR
output it, if it was anything else, output a CR then the current char.  This
add the need to do an extra loop at EOF to make sure the last LF get's output
as a CR. (In case the file only had LF's).

Hope this helps,
