
I don't think we'll be able to get one too soon unless David Graham is
sucessful in buying out IMS.  Microware will only sell the upgrades to the OEM,
which in our case is IMS.  From what I understand, there isn't anything in
there that we really need to have.  But yes, it would be nice to keep up with
the rest of the world.

I'd be more than happy to relieve you of one of those terminals.  Could sure
use one here for testing and allowing the wife and kids to access the machine
while I'm working on it.

Fm: Mark Griffith 76070,41
To: All

Hello All,

In keeping with the spirit of the Dirt Cheap Computer Stuff Co., we are now
offering a special modem deal.  You can get a 14.4 kbaud, send/receive FAX
modem, V.32bis, V.42bis, MNP Level 5 for $139.95.

What's the catch? This is specially made for use with a Macintosh computer, so
there is very little documentation, only a quick listing of the AT commands.
However, it does work, and works well (I'm using it now to upload this
message).

Full support for this modem will be available from me.  I can promise a
detailed list of all the AT commands and the S register settings as soon as I
figure them out.  Also, send and receive FAX capability is forthcoming when
Sterm-Pro is finished (I know, it is slow coming).

Compuserve has recently announced several new 14.4 kbaud lines in cities around
the country.  I tried one and was able to download a 100k file in about 60
seconds.  Pretty quick!

If anyone is interested, please let me know via e-mail, or call 314-583-1168.

Carl,

Gosh, your comment about 13 bits is odd. Seems to me that in early August,
shortly after 1.92 was posted, there was a flurry of correspondence from CoCo
users who were unable to use 13 bit compression; all with the same "Can't get
memory" error that I get. Did they all find a magic solution that I didn't?
Perhaps some of them will speak up now.

I'm not using L1; haven't used it for several years. Can't say if my friends
have the same trouble; I don't have any friends with CoCo's. Bob van der Poel
says he will give it a shot on his CoCo and let me know.

Umm,  none of that flurry of messages found their way back to me.  So I am

fit) the object in and that leaves 6 pages or 48K for the tables, which is
enough.  Why doesn't it work?  Can *anybody* help?  I *know* that it does work

No 9meg boards that I know of.  The problem is who finances it...  I may once I

to try it.  If he is successful, he plans to offer the service (at least that
is what I hear).  Don't know of any cpu boards for sale either.  Strange Q ....

You can keep the 1 Meg SIMMs if you want to.  Either they or 4 Meg SIMMs will
work.

If you need another CPU board, I might be able to sell one to you.  I can't
sell the ROMs along with it since they contain Microware code.  You need one as
a spare?  I can bring one or two to the fest.

Wayne,
        Gas got expensive, so cars became smaller and more efficient. Memory
chips got cheap - so computers (and programs) got bigger and no real effort is
made to conserve memory.  Heavy graphics handling, like this program, is always
the worst for hogging memory and storage.  The "standard" beginners C program -
prints "Hello There" on the screen - produces a file that wouldn't fit in the
ram on my first COCO.  Progress (GRIN).

Bob,

It's been a long time since we've had the entire UG library online - we've been
systematically purging the un-accessed files for the past few years, and what's
still online is only that which is interesting enough for someone to access it
at least one time in six months.

And while packing everything might save some space, the UG library is not the
largest one, by far, so the savings, while not marginal, wouldn't also be
classified as 'a whole bunch'! <g>

 *** New Product Announcment ***

Bob van der Poel Software is pleased to announce the availability of yet
another new OSK product: Magazine Index System. This is the same program proven
for years on Level II and RSDOS. We've rewritten it in C and added a termcap
interface so that is will run on any OSK system. The program comes with a set
of files covering 10 years of Rainbow and many other Color Computer magazines.
This program is file compatible with the other versions we've sold. It will be
demoed at the upcoming Atlanta Fest; however it is in stock right now for
immediate shipping. Price is only $19.95 plus $2.00 s/h (those who have
complained about high prices for OSK products should note that this is the same
price we charge for the Level II version). For more information leave email or
contact us at 604-866-5772, or PO Box 355, Porthill, ID, 83853.

up the 'errno' before returning to caller, just setting 'errno=0;' doesn't
work. But if I do the same trick for instance by attempting
a link to a non existent memory module with 'modlink', setting
'errno=0;' works  perfectly ok.

The problem is that I don't have complete access to the calling mechanism of
this trap, as a matter of fact don't even want to have
it, and the calling sw uses this 'errno' somehow, resulting to error on
caller's side.

What to do ??

Hmmm... I have been know to zero 'errno' in a signal handler, but have not had
occasion to do so in a trap handler.

Also - I'm not sure if this applies to trap handlers, but Microware documents
caution that if you do I/O in the main program (buffered), that you shouldn't
do it in the sig handler, or vice versa. Given the similarity to trap handlers,
I wonder if the same caution applies.

I wonder what happens when you call cio from another trap routine?

I seem to recall reading somewhere about not using 'errno' for signaling
errors. The problem is you never know what other library routines are doing
with it. It may be that it is another library function, not the trap. You might
be best off to return a value in the function call so that the caller doesn't
have to rely on errno for status.

  Trap handlers have their own static storage area,  this is one of the main
  reasons for using trap handlers instead of subroutine modules.  Register
  A6 points to this area in a trap handler, however the calling process's A6
  register's contents can be found on the top of the stack upon entry to a
  trap handler.

  Hope this helps.

 The main reason it is not recommanded to mess with errno in a signal trap is
because register A6 (the gobal variable pointer) may contain a different value
than the main program.

  OS9  F$Icpt
  (a0) address of intercept routine
  (a6) address to pass to intercept routine

example:

    vsect signal:       dc.w    1
        ends

        movem.l a0/a6,-(sp)         save registers
        lea     SigTrap(pc),a0
        lea Signal(a6),a6
        os9     F$Icpt
        movem.l (sp)+,a0/a6
        bcs error

           |
           |
           | error os9 F$Exit

SigTrap: move.w d1,(a6)  a6 points to the variable signal
        os9     F$RTE

     ends

Mark,
   I am having a problem with trying to get /t3 & /t4 working on my MM/1, and I
wonder if you could steer me in the right direction.

   Both ports are giving me the same results, so I wonder if something in
common with them is bad.

   I can fire up STERM, then transmit a dialup string to the modem, that works
fine. The modem receives the string, dials the number, I get a connect to
Compuserve, but at this point I get nothing on the screen.
   I know that Cis is sending, I can see the receive light on the modem
flashing when I press ENTER or control C, but I get nothing on the screen.

   At this point I have tried a number of things, I put an rs232 tester between
the modem and port, and I am getting the receive signal too this point.
   I tried xmodeing /t3 (and /t4) to type = 80, I tried setting the P4 jumpers
on the paddle board in both modes,(toggled or tied high), the P2 jumpers on the
paddle board are set for DTE, I even tried using the paddle board that I was
using on /t1 before I bought the MIDI board, same results. Having 3 bad paddle
boards is possible but not probable, so all I can think of now is that there is
some problem with the 68681.

  Would you have any other ideas about what I should try next ?

  I forgot to mention that I also tried InfoExpress and Tascom as well as
Sterm, but with the same results, transmit is working but no receive. These
programs all worked fine when I was using them on /t0, but /t3 & /t4 are no go.

Larry,

Check to make sure your modem's flow control settings match what you've got the
paddle boards set for. (That should be &K3).

I've been running a 14.4 bps modems on /t3 for a long time now without a
problem. The paddle board should be strapped to toggle, the descriptor type
should be type=80, make sure you've increased your input/output buffers to at
least 2K (use moded).


What kind of cable are you using? You didn't happen to do some creative wiring
when using it on /t0, did you?

There's  a file in the Library called HAND.THD (I think) that details what I
had to go through to get it to work. Maybe it'll help.

Steve,
    I did bump the in/out buffers up with moded, in=1024, out=512.

I'll check out that file.

 t0 so I'm not sure if thats the problem or not.

Larry Steve,
   I went back and used DED to change T3 & T4 type bytes (offset $5c) to 80,
made a new boot but still the same problem. On the paddle board P4 has pins 1&2
and 5&6 jumpered.
   I don't know if was line noise or not but I don't have a &K3 option on this
2400 baud Zoom modem, so I don't know what you are setting with that option.
   Would you have the correct cable connections handy, for going from a DB25 on
the modem to DB9 on MM/1. When I made up this cable I wasn't absolutely sure I
was tying the correct lines together, but it worked with
