Ed there is still something not quite correct with this, but it is doable the
display is limited to two lines and short lines at that. I can manage but if
you find anything let me know.

No, not .PU, PU. You do not include a line with ".PU" in your article to post.
You do not include anything special in your article to post. But when you enter
the "/EXIT" command in the editor, you are presented with a "Post Action Menu".
There you can enter a P to post the message. A few other options are prompted
for. One which is unprompted for is the "Post Unformatted" action, which you
ask for by entering a PU at the Post Action Menu prompt.

Michele,

There are two other ways to emulate the .lt/.el commands on Delphi. One is to
start a line with a period, that line will not processed by the formatter, and
the period will not be displayed. Another is to indent by at least one space,
which also works on Delphi, I think. I usually use this method, since in most
cases only part of a message is involved. You just have to remember to indent
the lines that you want left alone.

Hi Jim. Nice to see you still prowling around here. Sorry, I can't help on the

However, it _does_ use a straight cable.

James,

I don't have a 4 in 1, but I do have the earlier 3 in 1 board. I believe the
cables are the same. In fact, the cables ARE straight through, but only if you
use an IBM AT type DB-9 connector for your RS-232, not if you use the more
common (on modems) DB-25. The simple solution: use a straight through ribbon
cable from the 10 pin header to the DB-9, cutting off the 10th wire at the DB-9
end, then use a readily available 9 to 25 pin adapter (any computer store
should have this).

If you want to roll your own, the following pin connections will do the job:

   DB-25      DB-9 (or 10 pin header)   Signal
   -----      -----------------------   -----------------------
     1,7        5                       Ground
     2          3                       Transmit data (TXD)
     3          2                       Receive data (RXD)
     4          7   always enabled ---> Request to Send (RTS)
     5          8          ignored ---> Clear to Send (CTS)
     6          6          ignored ---> Data Set Ready (DSR)
     8          1                       Data Carrier Detect (DCD)
    20          4                       Data Terminal Ready (DTR)

No need to connect the rest. Note that the above wiring configures the Disto as
Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and is suitable for plugging into a modem. If you
want to connect directly to another computer instead, you must configure the
Disto as Data Communications Equipment (DCE) by wiring the cable as follows:

      DB-25         DB-9 (or 10 pin header)
      -----         -----------------------
        1,7           5
        2             2
        3             3
        4             8
        5             7
        6,8           4
       20             6

The cable so wired is called a null modem cable. Alternately, wire the cable as
shown in the top diagram, and buy a null modem adapter to connect two computers
together. Hope this all helps.

Thanks very much for the reply, Ian. I had not thought of the connections being
for a db9 connector. The old 2 in 1 board connected straight to a 25 pin
connector which I gather is different. I will try the nine pin straight
connection.

Zack,

> Hmm, was that U18 on the IO board by any chance? Reason I ask was that I >
received just today, a replacement PAL for U18, from Bill Wittman. He states >
in his letter that "on some systems, not many" require the new PAL to help >
solve "hard drive problems". Even though I am not having hard drive problems >
(unless you consider not being able to boot from the hard drive as a >
"problem"), "Pease highly recommends that you put it in".

We sent the new U18 PALs to Bill to distribute to the Atlanta buyers.  It fixes
a problem that didn't exist in the MM/1 but shows up with the faster processor.
Everyone *really should* put in the PAL.  It will be included in all future
kits.

The problem is that the chip select to the WD33C93 SCSI chip may (depending on
speed of other parts, temperature, phase of the moon, etc) go away before the
write strobe does.  This hoses the SCSI chip and causes it to write garbage to
the disk.  We changed the PAL equations to make write go away first to solve
the problem.

Thank you.  We try hard.  :)

The information you want is in "OS-9/CD-RTOS IFF Support Library (1990)" from
OptImage.  Try asking Lex van Sonderen in the CD-i forum (GO CD-I).  He looks
after "Knowledge Transfer" for Philips in LA and may be able to get you the

 Bob,

 Then I assume that using either 'echo \1b[2J' or 'echo ^Z' from the command
 line works but when put in the vdu file doesn't?  Doesn't really make any
 sense.  Hmm, what happens when you run SCULPTOR from your console without
 G-WINDOWS or from a terminal?  Do the appropriate codes work OK?  This will
 be a check on SCULPTOR.

Correct. Also works with GWindows. Tried both codes.

It certainly doesn't.

Sculptor has been working fine with my Wyse 60 terminal on my 20x all
these years. Sculptor recognizes my Wyse 60 connected to my UQEK-30.
Sculptor recognises standout and cursor motion (I presume since the menu
is printed and the screen form). Just no clear screen.

Unfortunately both the original and backup disks are no longer readable. I
don't recall wheather a vt100 vdu file was included.

Thanks for your help,

Bob

  There are some things I don't know about some of the hard disk drivers for

  but, has a rodime driver. ?...does this driver support the "quiry" the hard
