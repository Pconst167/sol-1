I give up.  Please tell me what to do to get started with this forum, like,
which utilities are necessary, and what should I get first.

For example, I'm new to OS9 but familiar with UNIX, so I want some of the
UNIX-like utilities to make me productive more quickly.  But they're "archived"
(compressed, I'm sure) -- what do I need to unarchive them? My OS9 machine
comes from Allen/Bradley (68030-based), so it may not (probably won't) run
anything already compiled (will it?).  I have a development set, so I'm not
afraid of source.  Is the 68030-stuff standard enough that I can run it on my
machine (binary compatibility? something UNIX can't seem to do, tho I can see
why that's hard to do.....)

I'd really just like to get the source and compile on my machine....  Any help
would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Mark Owen

Mark,

Most files are archived with a utility called AR. This is _very_ different from
the UNIX version you may be familiar with. Source can be found in the Utilities
library. Hope into any library and issue the following command:

 BROwse AR*.* /lib:all

THat should net you a couple of hits.

And actually, there's a good chance that executables _will_ work on your
machine. If I got my numbers right the 030 will run code compiled on a 'lesser'
machine. Give it a try. In any event, most of the programs here have the source
available.

a multitasking DOS operationg system called OS9.  What exactly is OS9 and will

Hello Ferranti Technologies

In order to track dpwn the problem, I need to know what processor you are
using(68000,68020,68030,68040), as this might be processor dependent. For
instance the 68040 needs the fpu-library, as the builtin fpu does not do
anything the MC68881/68882 do, so you actually gets illegal opcodes ?? Do you
use 'ssm(system security module). This could also cause 'bus-errors' if
user-state tasks make access to memory, that is not allocated for it !! The
'csl'-module should be installed from 'init' during startup. It is a
traphandler that contains subroutines for the ultra-c-libraries much the same
way 'cio' does for the 'old' C.

Larry,

Here's a simple CurXY() routine.  In fact it's the same as in the MM/1 cgfx.l

CurXY(path,x,y)
int path, x, y;
{
    unsigned char buff[3];

    buff[0] = 0x02;
    buff[1] = (x + 0x20) & 0xff;
    buff[2] = (y + 0x20) & 0xff;

    return ( write(path,buff,3) );
}

Really not all that difficult.  LOW I/O write() and read() vs. puts() and
gets() is unbuffered and much faster to windows.  BTW the above returns -1
on error with the error code placed in errno.

Why are you trying to place the mouse cursor?  Under KWindows it auto-follows
the mouse.  So, when you place it somewhere it will move back to where the
mouse is when you move the mouse again.

There's no way to turn off this 'feature' as far as I know.  You can draw your
own mouse cursor and PutBlk it anywhere you want to tho.  And the is a way to
turn the mouse cursor on/off.

#define ON 1
#define OFF 0

  MCurSw(path,OFF)
  MCurSw(path,ON)

Hope this helps,

Mike,
   That is what I finally found out. The code does move the mouse pointer to a
particular position, but then locks back on to the mouse. It was just a case of
in one part of the program I wanted the mouse pointer to start at a specific
location. I guess I was under the impression that the data coming from the
mouse was relative, not absolute.
   The problem was in my sloppy programming, at one point in the program the
user needs to select an item from a menu, but the menu routine gave random
results unless the mouse pointer started at the first menu item, so instead of
fixing the real problem I was going to try forcing the pointer to be where I
wanted it to be. Needless to say but that was dumb, I went back through the
menu routine and fixed it (I hope!!!), now it works correctly and it doesn't
care where the pointer starts from.


   Any tips you can give me on things that are essential to check for when
getting a file name from a user and then attempting to open the file.

I believe once buffering has been disabled, you can't turn it back on again, at
least not like that.

You could however _ummm_ cheat!

Try:

        Do output (buffered mode)
        stdout->flag |= _UNBUF;      /* see stdio.h */
        perform unbuffered output
        stdout->flag &= ~_UNBUF
        Resume buffered output.

Note that before unbuffering stdout, you should make sure that all characters
are flushed by doing an 'fflush(stdout)'.

Actually, using fflush(stdout) at any point is still the more efficient way to
do things. Single character (unbuffered) output is horribly abusive of the
system (and slow), if you don't really need it.

Pete's right, its better to use fflush(stdout) than setbuf(), since as far as I
know, there is no way to turn buffer back on, once its turned off. The other
option that Mike suggested can also work. Just take my example and replace the
puts(mouse_pos) with write(1,mouse_pos,6). Mixing low level I/O with buffered
I/O works fine, as long as you remember to use fflush() after any buffered I/O,
like printf, puts, etc, otherwise you can get some interesting results!

   Thanks, now I just need to figure out how to use fflush(). The fflush() I
have says it needs to be in this form fflush(Fp), where Fp is a pointer to a
file. fflush(stdout) doesn't work.
  Do I have to do something like this:
 ... oops , I didn't actually try fflush(stdout), I have set Wpath = to stdout,
and then I used fflush(Wpath). Could that be why it didn't work?
  I need to try this again...

Bill, I uploaded a program called 'defrag' sometime ago to library 10. It just
defragments files (not directories). Nor does it actually repack the HD
structure. However, it is in C and the source is there. It might need some work
to handle 512byte sectors, etc. It was written for 6809 and I the source on my
68K box...but never have gotten around to fixing it.

The source was uploaded for "non-commercial" use only. If you use it as is for
a commercial product you'll have to talk to me first. However, if you just use
the source as a starting point to roll your own...

Tony,

Amazingly, I just had the same problem the other day! (error 200 while
compiling a C program).

Finally, Pete noticed that I'd accidentally typed:

  #include "file.c"

where I'd meant to type:

  #include "file.h"

and the "file.c" was the file being compiled... so it was recursively including
itself and running out of paths.  Wonder if this is the same thing happening to
you?

luck - kev

PS- OTOH, if you really meant a Basic program getting an error 200, look to
make sure it's not opening the same file over and over again without closing
it.

Most of the time this error is due to a loop in the program where a file is
opened and then never closed, ultimately filling the users path table. Check to
see if there are any file open statements and then make sure each open has a
corresponding close.

Hello to all,

I'm not a new OS9 user, strictly, nor even new to this forum.  But it's been
several years since I've use the OS, and I've been a lurker here, mostly.

I'm using OS9 again, and find it as hard to "get into" as ever.  I would
*greatly* appreciate using some of the tools here, but can't even manage that.
Embarrassed, but unbowed, I'm asking you the usual simple questions.

  * I have kermit on a PC and on my 68K OS9 machine, and can transfer files
    from CIS to the PC and from it to OS9.

  * I can transfer the *.c files, but have no "intelgob.c" file.  Many of
    the source files seem to use #include's that I don't have.

  * I can transfer the *.bin files, but am not sure what to do with them.
    They don't appear to be directly executable under OSK, they don't seem
    to be S files.  What are they?  What do I do to run one?

..because of the above, all the lovely *.ar and *.lzh files are pretty unusable
to me.  I looked for a "How to use the archive files" text file, but didn't
find one.  Nothing very helpful in my stored *.msg stuff from long ago either.
I feel pretty silly, but .... help!

Bert, I can answer some of your questions. 1> I have kermit on a PC and on my
OSK machine..
        Yes you can transfer files from your PC to OSK and the other way around
too!. I have Procomm Plus vers 2.01 on my PC and it works perfectly with my OSK
kermit.

2> I can transfer the *.c files, but have no ...
        Most SIMPLE 'c' programs should re-compile without any problems.
        Obviously, any strange PC specific includes or special 'c' functions
like graphics will need some MAJOR mods.

Bert,

All the .ar files ahve been archived with AR. Hope into any library and type
BROwse AR* /lib:all  and up will pop the varrious files you'll need. Read the
descriptions and pick the version for the processor you're running.

 .lzh files have been archived with LHA. In LIB 12 you'll find LHA201.bin and
LHASRC.lzh.

Hope this help you get going. If mot .... just give a shout.

Bert,

If you don't have them already, grab ar68.bin in LIB 9 for the *.ar files, and
lha201.bin in LIB 12 for the *.lzh files. Place ar68.bin and lha201.bin in an
execution directory, like /DD/CMDS, rename ar68.bin to ar, and rename
lha201.bin to lha, then set the execution attributes, like this: attr lha ar -e
-pe

Now you should have working versions of ar, to bust up the *.ar archives, and
lha to bust up the *.lzh archives.

C source files for the PC will, in most cases, not be easy to port to OSK. The
simpler the program, the easier the port. Unix C source code is much easier to
port to OSK, and there are a couple of libraries developed to support some of
the Unix functions.

Don't be embarrased about asking questions, that's what we're here for!

Thanks to all for their responses,

Bill's advice seems particularly helpful, but thaks to Steve & Scott as well.
I'll get back to my OS9 system this evening and see where this takes me.

I suspect I'll have more questions in a couple of days.

Sb: #SoundTracker Modules?
Fm: Stephen Seneker 75020,3611
To: ALL

Where would be a good place to look for SoundTracker/NoiseTracker sound module
specifications?  How about OctaMED MED sound file specifications? Why?  I'm
writing a module player for the MM/1.  I have source code for players for Sparc
Stations and Indigos but the ports rung way out of real time and don't work too
good as module to raw sound data conveters, slow.

Where have I tried?  Well, I tried on Usenet comp.multimedia and
alt.binaries.sounds.d, no luck.  Here I've looked in the AmigaTech forum, no
luck.

Geez, why is it such a pain to find information about file formats?

Stephen - do you mean Amiga MOD sound files?  I ported the Unix/Sparc player a
while back... I think it's still in a closed library section here.   It only
works okay realtime up to about 3KHz or so (awful), but will also send out a
file to be played later... which works great!

Perhaps one of the sysops more familiar with moving library files around these
days can move it into a public section.  It was called "tracker" something, I
think?

If some of it was moved to asm vs C, I think the speed could be greatly
improved. - kev Ex

Kevin, I recently port str32 for the Sparcstation.  Though it does run outside
of real-time.  I've been using it as a converter though.  However I think that
I can write a player from scratch for the MM/1 that will run in real-time.
Don't you think that if an Amiga 500/600 can play them then the MM/1 should be
able to o also.

str32 lack of speed is due to the fact that it uses much floating point
arithmetic. Any ideas as to where one could find detailed specifications for
these formats?

Sb: #CHD problems
Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: All

I've had more than one person make a request for a change in the way VED
handles reading and switching directories. Currently, when its file selector is
feed a directory name it just calls the C chd() function. This makes stepping
though directories pretty simple. However, it has a problem:

The application has no idea what the original directory was. This means that if
someone is in the directory a/b/c/d when the program starts, loads a file
'foo', makes some changes, then reads in another file using the file selector
and changes directories... when 'foo' is saved it will be in the new, not
original, directory.

This gets to be a bother when multiple buffers are being used. One buffer might
be editing 'foo' from the directory VED was in when started; a 2nd buffer might
be editing 'woof' from '....../a/b'. Just saving the files will put them both
in '....../a/b'. Probably not what the doctor ordered.

I guess that what I need is a pushdir() function. Then the file selector could
do all the chd()s it wants. When a file is selected, the pushdir() information
could be saved with the filename. Then, when a save it done it could restore
the file to the correct directory.

The only other method I see is to manually keep track of the path
names--appending directory names to a pathlist as the directoy is stepped
though. But that becomes real complicated real fast...after all, isn't that why
we have an OS?

Any ideas, suggestions, comments, etc. will be appreciated.

Bob,

I wish I could help, but I have the exact same problem right now with
InfoXpress, and I haven't been able to solve it. So far the only thing I've
come up with, but haven't tried yet, is to get the output of "pd" via a pipe.
The only other way, I guess, would be to do what "pd" does, which is run
backwards through the directories all the way to the root directory. Other than
forking a new process, I don't think there's any way to save the current data
directory, change it, then put it back. Please let me know if you come up with
a solution.

Hi Kevin... David Graham (NIMITZ) asked me to relay a couple questions to you.
Here they are:
  Is Windio48 hard-coded for 3 Megs? Will it work on a 'personal' system?

  Are docs for BGFX available? Seems a friend of his has it but no docs. If
docs are not available, he's willing to write them.

 OS-9 has versions that run on Motorola 6809 or Hitachi 6309,
                     and       Motorola 680x0 processors.

 OS-9000 is an enhanced version of OS-9 that is written in C (instead of
assembly like its predecessor) that runs on Intel 80386 and higher processors
as well as the high end of the Motorola 680x0 family.  C makes it portable, but
for performance considerations some or the deep kernel routines are done in
assembly.

In many ways the OS-9(000) family of operating systems resemble Unix.  However,
as I understand it, Unix while is multi-tasking and multi-user, it is not
what's referred to as a real-time operating system.  OS9 has a pre-emptive
interupt system.  OS9 is also ROMable which makes it very handy for black-box
applications.  Chances are you've used an OS-9 system at some time in your life
without knowing it.  (I've been told that the do-it-yourself electronic scales
at some post offices are run by a ROM-based OS-9 system under the covers.  And
that's just one.  FermiLab uses an OS-9 system.  NASA uses OS-9, I'm told on
the shuttle.)

There are experts in the forum here that are far more advance in the use of
OS-9, but I'm sold on its viability and vitality.
