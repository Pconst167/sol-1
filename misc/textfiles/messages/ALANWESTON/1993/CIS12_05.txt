Hi Mark, got the InfoXpress going with CIS, still cant logon to Delphi, the
Calgary port requiers after Carrier Detect a " O " then " Delphi " after that
it will ask for the User Name, then the password...  How do I set that up in
the Delphi section of the default.ini file?   Any help would be appriciated...

Dieter,

Good to see you've got InfoXpress working here on CompuServe!

I'll see if I can help with your Delphi problem. It sounds like you're using a
Tymnet node. Make sure that the network type for the network option block for
Delphi is set to tymnet. For example:

[Tymnet2400]           ;Network option block for Tymnet at 2400 bps
 NetworkType = Tymnet   ;Network type is Tymnet
 Modem = T0             ;Modem option block name
 BaudRate = 2400
 PhoneNumber = 555-1234

I don't know if anyone has actually used a Tymnet node in Canada with
InfoXpress, I would think that the nodes are the same, but they might not be.
If necessary, I can call your node and check it out. Let me know if you get it
working.

fwiw, I have used a local Tymnet node with IX during a few weekends when the
Telenet node was down.

Zack,

I use Tymnet almost all the time. Athough the Sprintnet node is more reliable,
there's a 9600 bps Tymnet node in Miami!

I use a Tymnet node from Ottawa to access Delphi, using InfoXpress.  Works like
a charm.

Hey, Dieter, next time I make it to southern Alberta, I will try to get in
touch.  (I grew up in Vulcan, so Calgary is like part of the old
neighbourhood...)

Cheers... / Ken

If the Calgary Tynet port "requires" you to set your terminal identifier to
"O", then somethings wrong. Using "O" set your terminal to MARK/SPACE parity.
It'll look fine for text messages, but you'll not be able to download any
files.

You should use the "A" option which saves parity and is what Bill as coded into
the login script.

What happens if you use things the way they're written?


BTW ... I hear tell CompuServe just opened a Calgary node. Have you tried it
yet for CompuServe access?

Steve,

Actually InfoXpress follow Delphi's Tymnet logon instructions to the letter, it
sends "O", downloads are not a problem that I'm aware of. I do the same for
CIS, now too, although IX used to send "A".

That's interesting. WHen I was futzing around with Tymnet's outdials I was
using the O terminal identifier and found I couldn't get any file transfers to
work between my computer and the computer I outdialed to. This was using
kermit, xmodem, ymodem and zmodem.

Switched to "A" and the problems went away.

I'm hoping Bill Dickhaus will see this and answer 'cause I don't know. If he
doesn't, send him a message directly.  His CIS ID is in your documentation at
the end.

I have just uploaded a new version of the patch for rma which enables it to
assemble 6309 code.  The filename I uploaded it under is "r63v13.ar".  However,
I made 2 attempts to upload under Cis-B protocol, and apparently it aborted (on
CIS's end??).  Anyway, I finally attempted it under X1k, and it completed, but
I tried to do so under the same name all 3 times, and I'm not sure if CIS
deletes an aborted file.  The original file length was 48762 bytes.  The ar
file contains 2 files, rma13.ipc (41799 bytes) and r63.doc (8699 bytes),
original lengths.
  If the file is bad, let me know and I'll try it again.

Thanks

When you say, "It is available through EFFO", what exactly does that mean? From
what I have seen, EFFO and Steven are not honoring the GNU copyleft by not
distributing source code.

Nope, You have to do your own _gs_scsz() afterwords and reset-up the window on

I sent email to Bear Software last night. Today, I had my first compressed file
in my mailbox (plus a request for a $25.00 deposit). Seems to be working fine.
They promise to collect all the messages, compress them, and send the package
to my CIS mailbox on a daily basis. Guess I'll let it run for awhile and see
how it goes (and see if there is much that I really want to read).

Will your hpload program work on printers other than hp?  Is it a pcl5 thing or
a postscript thing?

I am a printer and would like to buy a hi-speed modem and postscript printer
(hi-res like 600 dpi) so my customers could call-in and upload printing jobs!
I guess they could include the fonts but wouldnt I need to use your utility to
download them to the printer.  The files my customers would send would have to
be postscript (since I can't do much with pagemaker or quark native files on an
osk system).
