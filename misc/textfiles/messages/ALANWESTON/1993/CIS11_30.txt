The OSK/68000 section contains, as I just discovered, all the material to port
Ghostscript to OS-9. Unfortunately, this requires a lot of disk space, RAM and
CPU speed - I had to learn when I ported the 2.52 version to OS-9 about 6 month
ago. This OS-9 version contains a large number of drivers, including drivers
for the MGR window manager, and comes with three different binaries (68000,
68020 without and with FPU). It is available through the European Forum For
OS-9 (EFFO). For those who want to do their own port: L. Peter Deutsch (the
spirit behind Ghostscript) agreed to let OS-9 enter
the list of officially supported operating systems from the next version
onwards (to be released at end 1993). Irrespectively, EFFO will continue to
distribute compiled binaries, fonts and other material that is needed to have
Ghostscript running under OS-9.

Carl,

John Wainwright has already ported Ghostscript 2.6.1 to OSK.  You can find it
in the OS-9 forum library section 12, I believe.  The full source is also
there.

Thanks for you interest and support!

Ultra C definately generates the smallest code, if you don't use any libraries.
But, in real life.....  I haven't found why the ucc compiled code bus traps,
but I did find why the gcc compiled code died with 107 - it is blowing all the
floating point stuff.  I can't believe I am the only one to ever do floating
point, so what am I doing wrong?  I don't have a 68881 in the target, so need
the emulation.  A test program works with 1.37.1, but not on 2.4.1 or 2.4.5
(either July or Oct releases). Any ideas anyone?

Well, the replacement for the bad 68340 accelerator board arrived today, so I
poped it in, reassembled everyting and powered the MM/1 up, and volla it
worked!  Boy am I ever clad, I thought there for a few days that I did someting
wrong and blew the whole ting...

Now I have to make a new bootfile for the hard drive, have one made for floppy
boot, but there are quiet a few drivers that I need missing.  But that will
have to wait for another day.

the next few days will be taken up by remodiling the basement, have to ad a
badroom and a bedroom, and then the house will be finiched...

Now all I have to do is getting the InfoXpress going on the MM/1, right now I'm
using WinCim on my PC...

G'Day!

I think I asked this before and got no answer...so could someone pass it along
on other nets?

I can't seem to get debug information working with GCC. (I am using gcc2
2.4.5). The usage message indicates that -g will generate debug code for
srcdbg. It doesn't appear to do so. If I enable the -v switch I can see that no
-g is passed along to either c68 or l68. Either I'm missing something, or gcc2
is broken. I don't have gcc2 source so I'm inbetween a rock and a hard place 
since I need to use an ansi compiler for a current porting project.

Any help will be appreciated!

This is the output of mfree after completeing the 4 Meg Memory Hack on an MM/1.
Notice the 8 Meg of free RAM! You too can have this.

There are two ways to get the hack.  Ask me and I'll send you the details so
you can do it yourself.  However, be cautioned that this is not a pretty hack,
nor is it easy to do.  You'll need to have a good amount of experience in
soldering, cutting traces, pulling pins up on already soldered in chips,
piggybacking chips, and running tiny wires around on the board.  If you have
never done something like this, I wouldn't attempt it yourself.  You can do
permanent and fatal damage to the I/O board.

The other method is to let me do it for you.  For a $50 charge, I'll perform
the hack, test it, and make a new init module for you.  I'll also guarantee my
work for a year (the hack only).  All you need to do is send me your I/O board.
If you want me to include the 4 Meg SIMMs, let me know.  I haven't priced them
lately, but I'm sure I can get some at a reasonable price for you.  I should be
able to do the hack and get your board back within 2 weeks.

This would make a great Christman present to yourself.  If anyone is
interested, let me know via email.

                        Announcement for All MM/1 Owners

The much rumored 4 Meg memory hack is now a reality.  The Dirt Cheap Computer
Stuff Co. has tested it and it works just fine.  As a service to other MM/1
owners, we can provide those with the technical skills the details of the hack
and you can go for it yourself.  You'll need some real good soldering skills
and be able to get some simple parts.  Of course, if you do the hack yourself,
you're on your own.

For those not so technically inclined, or those not too sure about themselves,
DccS will perform the hack for you for a small fee.  If you are interested,
send in your I/O board along with $50 and we'll do the hack for you, test it,
and ship your board back within two weeks (unless we get swamped, then you'll
be notified of the delay).  If you would like us to get the SIMMs and install
them for you, please contact me at the number and address below.

For those who don't know what I'm talking about, the 4 Meg hack is a method to
allow your MM/1 to use 4 Meg SIMMs without the need to buy a new backplane.
This will give you a 9 Meg system, 1 Meg for video and 8 Meg of user RAM.

Nah ... I don' think that's the problem. More likely, he put together this file
at the office and shipped it out over the Internet to me at wuarchive and asked
that I post it on the CoCo LIST.  (for some reason, his site can receive, but
not post.)

I thought it was a "newsworthy" post and just cross posted it here.
