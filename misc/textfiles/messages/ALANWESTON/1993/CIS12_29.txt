I have a CoCo 3 system (CoCo 3/512K, 20 meg Hard Disk, Floppy Disk (2), OS-9,
Color Monitor, 2400 baud modem, and a ton of documentation in substantial
disarray) that I no longer use.  Is anyone out there willing to dissuade me
from throwing it away?  What I would like is for someone to drive up and take
it off my hands because the thought of packaging the stuff for safe shipment is
unsavory.  I live in Hyattsville, Maryland - 301-422-7753 - if you're
interested, give me a call.  Otherwise, I fear I will have to toss it.  Ches.

a couple of weeks on short notice.)

Got a bunch of stuff to upload pretty soon.  Looks like I got behind and didn't
post a Christmas Present this year, tho <grin>.

Hey Kev .... your mail box filled up recently and you were spilling over into
mine, so I had to zapp your CoCo List account (if you hadn't already noticed).

You might want to re-up.

hello ole

thanks for the response. we are not utilizing disk cacheing. rbf is edition 79
rev e000. is the diskdriver reference one of hardware or software?

As a consumer of OS-9000 for three years, but a Compuserve neophyte, could
somebody give me a clue whether the total absence of OS-9000 activity on this
forum is indicative of: 1) wrong forum, 2) nobody on Compuserve uses OS-9000,
3) there are no other users of OS-9000...

Right forum.

I am also an OS-9000 user, but not a very active one. I, like several other
OS9/68K developers, got a cheap copy of V1.2 last spring at a Color Computer
Fest in Chicago.

Microware has not really pushed personal use of OS-9000. What is your use?
Personal? Business? Industrial?

btw: you may want to check the libs for some stuff I uploaded to the OSK
directory as there is not a specific OS9K directory.

You're in the right place Kurt!

I know of a couple of OS-9000 users that are pretty active on the forum, so
feel free to ask your questions. I'm sure someone will pipe up!

Microware has posted the most recent issue of PIPELINES in LIB 15. It contains
a number of reference to OS-9000 and related products. Also, if you search the
libraries using a keyword of os-9000 or os9000 you will pop up a couple of
utilities that have been ported over.

Are you looking for anything in particular we could help you with?
