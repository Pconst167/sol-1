Al, what you need is either Burke & Burke's REPACK or CBM utilitity.  They
both re-organize your drive a bit and clean up fragmentation.  I think
CBM only cleans up fragmentation in the bit map while repack cleans up
both the bitmap and the physical as well as logical fragmentation, un-
fragmenting files as well as the drive itself.  CBM is faster, but
repack is probably more complete.  See if you can find either utility,
both work with floppies as well as hard drives.  Good luck.

From Kevin Darling's "Inside OS9 Level II" (which I suppose is what
you're talking about), the Default palette table is in GrfInt at offset $02F2.
Look for the 16 bytes: $3f, $09, $00, $12, $24, $36, $2d, $1b, and then
the same 8 repeated.  Any good disk editor should make it easy to change
these.  Be very careful to play with this on a backup disk, of course, since
accidentally changing the wrong thing could be disastrous.
   I don't have the offset within WindInt handy, but you should be able to
search for the above sequence of bytes to patch the color table in that.

When processing the interrupt fast enough is a concern, it might be
necessary to set up a circular buffer to store successive interrupts
in.  Have the interrupt handler store the interrupt value in a circular

not to mention easing the timing constraints on processing the

A better keyboard interface was discussed extensively on the
Internet mailing list a couple of years ago.  Several of us worked
out an approach that allows you to distinguish all of the
keys on the keyboard without going to two-byte sequences (which
can be tough to parse).  Eddie Kuns has been threatening for a long
time to disassemble the MM/1 keyboard driver and implement the scheme
we came up with.  If someone is going to actually implement a better
keyboard driver, they should talk to Eddie or myself or one of the
other people who were involved in that discussion for details
of the scheme we came up with.  It accomplishes everything you

 The CGFX.l library contains a function that will send a signal when a
mouse button is pressed. While it is waiting for that signal, the program
can sleep, giving it's CPU time to other processes. I haven't seen anything
that will do the same for keyboard responce. ie, Sleep until a key has been
pressed, then wake up. Do you have such a function? If so, I need it.

    Issuing a _ss_ssig (pathnum,signumb) will tell the system to send your
process an interrupt when a key is pressed. Following that with a tsleep(0)
call will make the system sleep until such a time as your interrupt is
generated. This is a standard call of the OS, no special library needed.

On SCSI drives, you should remove terminators from all drives EXCEPT the
last drive PHYSICALLY connected on the ribbon cable.  It doesn't have
to correlate to the last device, but should be the drive that's at te

If you want to reuse a drive on another system after the terminators have
been removed, you will want to keep the terminators handy.  When you
switch the drive over to the new system, reinstall the terminators as per the
rule of thumb for SCSI devices.

Mike:

I suspect that has to do with the KenTon interface not having access to
the ATN line.  Joe Scinta recommends soldering a 1/8 watt resistor from
1 to 10K ohms between the ATN pin and 5 volts on the drive bus (can7t
remember the exact locations, but you could refer to a SCSI spec).

It sounds like in your case, the terminating resistor on the last drive
is providing enough voltage to the ATN line to hold it high when needed.

Yeah he told me about that, but I don't have the scsi specs. he told me
which pin on the terminator, but it didn't work, so i left both
terminators in.

Dear Boisy,
On the st-25 51n there are three terminator resistor "packs". Do I remove
all three of these, or just one or ??? --Jeremy

Bro. Jeremy:

Remove all three resistor packs to properly un-terminate the drive.  They
should just pull right out (with a little prodding of with pliers if
necessary).  Save all three in case you need to re-terminate the drive at a
latter date.

When you take them out, make a little drawing of exactly how they were
in there.  If you put them in backwards later on, it could case some
problems with the SCSI bus.

I had to put the terminators back in. Now the st-251n is working as /h0
and the st-138n is working as /h1.  Both have the terminators on them.  The
st-138's are soldered, the st-251's plug in.  Evenutally I will be pulling
the st-138n off of the system.

For any analog audio, I would go with the RCA "phono" type connectors. Most

IX has an alternate dialing script that might just do what you need. It will
support 4 script commands: DLAY{value},SEND{string},WAIT{string}and EXIT.
With this, you should be able to develops a MACRO that will allow you
to utilize Conn-net. I'd check with Bill Dickhaus, author of IX for the

There is an OSK version of mtsmon in the libraries at CompuServe a well as
being in the OS9 archives at wuarchive.wustl.edu. Executables only due to the
fact that some inappropriate liberties were taken with the author's source code
of another popular OS9 utility he released years ago. Once burned twice shy
and all that ...

While mtsmon does exist for the 6809, I don't think Carl ever released it.

ttyset is used to allow a user to change the terminal type for their
path that they are set for. An example would for say a say a user
is on /T2 and they type ttyset
it would allow them to type in a new terinal config for the path of
 /t2 without messing up any other paths that you have configured for
the other serial ports. In essence it is nothing complex but I rahter
have the original version than taking the time to bang up my own release

I could be badly mistaken but I have never heard of ttyset on an OS-9 system,
but it sounds like something I've seen on a UNIX system.  It is my understanding

that if you want to set TERM environments you would use setenv TERM (term type)
This could also be included as part of a user's login file.  UNIX sometimes
uses this format also with many of its shells.
I hope I understand your question correctly and that I haven't added to the
confusion.

This works like the unix ttyset but this is for os9 level 2. it modifies
the ttytype file in your /dd/sys directory. I would have been a kicker
if only os9 level  2 let you have environment varibles. :)

Those are some very good ideas!  Multi-Vue is much closer to being useable
with NitrOS9, and the extensions you mentioned will go a long way towards
the point where I would use it every day.  2 things I would like to see are:
Be able to use 16 colors in Gshell (might not be worth the effort tho)
 Be able to copy a file like you can delete one with the trashcan.  (ie. click
on the file icon, then click on the RBF device above the trashcan)

Boisy,

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  You have just solved (for me) one of
the great mysteries of Multi-Vue's AIF files!  There have been a number
of times I tried to run programs under MV and got ziltch results because
a parameter was needed (VU and AR come to mind).  Then I saw this:

>                        CURRENT AIF FORMAT
>
>Field                    Line   Explanation
>=====                    ====   ===========
>Shell                  <--- 1:  Name of program to run
>                       <--- 2:  Parameters (or ? for prompt)
>ICONS/icon.shell       <--- 3:  path to icon, execution directory relative
>0                      <--- 4:  additional memory (in pages)
>2                      <--- 5:  window type
>80                     <--- 6:  X size
>24                     <--- 7:  Y size
>2                      <--- 8:  foreground palette
>0                      <--- 9:  background palette

and the light came on!  The information Tandy never bothered to give those
of us without advanced computer science degrees!  I quickly altered my
AIF for VU, adding the '?' to the second line, then clicked on it.  WOW!
A window opened asking for the parameters, I fed it the filename, and
voila! I was in business.  [For a moment.  Now I need to know how to
make VU clear the page on the MV window before it writes the new one.]

I've never had any major problems with MV (discounting the above) --
even Max9 ran fine as long as it was on /dd.  I think it is well worth
the effort to upgrade our little GUI from Tandy, and while my programming
knowledge is piddly and I basically have to watch from the sidelines, I
applaud you and wish you well.

In the way of improvements to MV, my wish list would include having new
SHELLs pop up in plain boxes, rather than the stock double box.  A plain
box would allow use of applications that require the full 640x192 or
320x192 screen (VU is one of those; I believe Max9 was another).  Since
I use ED3.1 and it already has a clipboard function, I don't really need
that implemented, but there may be folks who do.

Is there a need for a MV tutorial?  I'd be happy to serve as a proofreader
for documentation.

Please remember, that the ? feature on line two of the AIF was NOT, I

     I know Delphi has a policy against advertising software.  But I

didn't allow the prices in  Rainbow, or  Hot CoCo ads.  As a result:
you never got a chance to hear about and try them.   Let me give you

Mark,

  > No one is taking the machine to its full capabilities.

    Funny, that's almost a direct quote of something I said during the
discussions that preceded the MM/1, TC-70 and System IV. Several years ago
now when everyone was talking about the need to move to a faster, more
powerful system I was screaming that we hadn't even pushed the CoCo 3 to its
full capabilities yet, and that if we did move to such a system, the same
thing would happen. Well, it seems I was right.

    Now I will admit that OSK has seen some software proted that is simply too
big for the CoCo to handle, but besides that GhostScript and Tex stuff, (or
whatever it is,) and the ability to display pictures in more colors, how much
of this new software couldn't be done on the CoCo 3? In fact, how much software
is there for the CoCo 3 that the OSK systems can't even touch yet? I'd say
quite a bit.

    Does this surprise you? You've always seemed to be a pretty firm realist
so I doubt it. But why should it surprise any of us?

    On a slight side note, do you think that adoptimg "standards" such as are
currently being discussed will be necessarily destructive to the possibility
of taking the machine to its full capabilities? Will everyone start
programming for the lowest common denominator, (full portability to every
other system, including terminals)?

  > I have yet to see anyone make use of the sound capabilities of the MM/1...

    I agree, and that's something I had really been looking forward to. Oh
well, its on my list of software that I want to write. It is a little ways down
the list, though. I should get to it sometime around the year 2000. (disgusted

  > We also don't see anyone doing anything with the great full motion video

    Exactly what are you referring to here? The VSC's built in RLE decoding?
The PIXAC? What kind of software do you think could be done. Besides in doing
some animation I can't think of any great use of the RLE decoding. And what
kind of useful animation could you do? I would love to use the PIXAC, but it
doesn't seem to be supported in K-Windows, and even though you can go around
K-Windows to access it, as a C programmer I have absolutely no idea how to do
it. Have you something else in mind?

  > We aren't even getting the basic applications built. ...after almost 6 or 7
  > years of flogging the lack of applications horse...

    I understand what you're saying here, and even agree, but, for you
personally, what are we missing? What applications that YOU PERSONALLY want to
have need to be around in a year or two to keep you from leaving? For me
personally, I program, I telecommunicate, I word process, and occasionally I
just like to endulge in some entertainment. To those ends, the MM/1 is pretty
close to satisfying my needs already. Granted a DTP would be nice, support for
some of the more modern file transfer formats *included* in term programs (as
opposed to the standard OS9 technique of using outside programs to do the job)
would be nice, and some more entertainment software is definitely needed. But
overall my MM/1 is serving my needs pretty well. Which of your needs aren't
being met?

Um, what is your point, here? That there is little reason to upgrade to an
MM/1 since most of the MM/1 software could have been done on a CoCo3? If
that is your point, then I disagree. In my case, most of my MM/1 offerings
are programs which I originally wrote for the CoCo and ported to the MM/1,
but things like painting the screen and the smoothness of the animation
make the game programs look and feel a hundred times better on the MM/1.

Are we talking OS9 software on the CoCo3 or just "software"? If we are
talking OS9 software, then virtually ANYTHING written for OS9 on the
CoCo3 is portable to the MM/1, it just takes a programmer's time (and
the availability of an MM/1) to do it. Now, there are some OS9 programs,
like the recently announced SMASH from Northern Xposure, and ALL ROM based
programs which access various HARDWARE aspects of the CoCo3, like GIME
registers and the like. These programs WOULD be very difficult to port
for obvious reasons.

 > > I have yet to see anyone make use of the sound capabilities of the

The name escapes me, but there is someone working on a "sound editor"
type of program. I thought it may have been finished by now, but I haven't
seen any postings from the author lately.

I breifly looked at this myself, and wrote a snippet of code which took
a small sample and then played it back out. I was so disappointed with the
lack of consistency in the quality I gave up on it. Apparently some early
MM/1's have problems generating clean samples, something about the '070
being too noisy on the buss or something like that. Mark?

    No, not at all. I do support the decision to upgrade and am very happy that

   Yes, there was. I believe you're referring to Stephen Seneker, who was

I think that the CoCo was taken to it's limits a long time ago.  There
is just so much you can do with a 64K machine.  While its true that new
ideas are still coming out, there will never be anything like what is
available for the rest of the computing world.  I'm talking about the
multimedia stuff, super graphics and sound, etc.  The CoCo was and still
is a good machine, but let's be realistic.

I don't see standards having anything to do with how people program.
Standards are there to make things easier, not to have one program or
programmers methods forced upon everyone else.

The MM/1 has the ability to pull full motion video off the hard drive and
display it on the screen.  You might have to use a small window, as lots
of the PC machines do, but it can be done.  Someone needs to come up with
a program to display whatever current full-motion video format the PC crowd
is now supporting.

    Agreed. But what I am saying here is that there are a lot of things that
still could have done on a CoCo 3 that never were. Maybe a CoCo 3 couldn't
have run a Video Toaster, but it could have done better video effects than
anyone ever did with it. No one program ever pushed that 6809 Gime combination
to its max, meaning pretty close to 100% of system resources being used by
said program, much like the original Dragon's Lair did on the Amiga. It has
been said that that program pushed the Amiga to its limits. What such program
can you name for the CoCo 3? Now, understanding this, and also understanding
that most, if not all of the MM/1 prgrammers came from the CoCo, why would
anyone expect anything different from MM/1 programs? If we didn't use all of
the CoCo 3's resources why would we do it on the MM/1?

  > Standards are there to make things easier, not to have one program or
  > programmers methods forced upon everyone else.

    That is certainly how it should be. But let's take a look at something that
happened in the Mac arena. Anyone who has used a Mac knows how they use their
mouse and scrollbars. Well, some guy wrote a program which redefined this
"standard" of theirs and did his scrollbars in a totally different way. Moreso
than anything abot the merits of the program, the only discussion about this
paritcular program was a public lambasting of the programmer because of his
having broken the "standard". I would hate to see something so ridiculous
happen here.

    Are you referring to a specific function of the VSC, or just the fact that
the MM/1's data transfer rates are fast enough to do FMV (full motion video)
from the hard drive? What practical applications do you see this
realistically being used in? I've spent much time and effort trying to get
the specifications to Apple's Quicktime format, which the Mac folks are using
now, with little success. I've tried the Mac sig here, the mac and multimedia
sigs on C-Serve, and even calling Apple. I finally found a file which is what
I think I'm looking for, but its archived in a Mac specific format that we
can't bust. If you have a way of getting this format I would be more than
happy to take a crack at writing a viewer, especially now with the MM/1's
68340 expansion board, since a 68020 is required on the Mac to run it.

     14.4 modem
     From: TEDJAEGER    To: ALL

Just got a new 14.4 modem! Hooked up on /t0 of my MM1. Called Sprintnet
and got echoed back CONNECT 9600. From here nothing I type is echoed
to my screen or has the desired effect. Thus "@D" does not generate the
normal "Terminal" prompt and "c Delphi" does nothing. Do I need to
turn off the modem's flow control or something? If so, how? My problem

Ted, /t0 does not support the proper hardware lines for the modem to operate
effectively.Most likely your modem defaults to the much desired hardware
handshaking mode. While you can monkey around with /t0 and the modem settings
to get it to work (sorta), tis far better to put the modem on /t3. This will
allow you to use it almost to its full potential.

The modem  may work better on /t2. I'm not really sure, as I've never tried it.
According to the tech manual, there is a way to do hardware handshake with
either /t0 or /t2, but it doesn't say *exactly* how.  I would guess that it
requires a custom cable crossing DCD with CTS (for /t2), and DCD with CTS and
DTR with RTS (for /t0).

  If getting a paddle for /t3 is not an option right now, try it on  /t2. If
more control is needed, I guess we'll just have to puzzle it out. :>

T2 is an even worse choice for the modem as it only has TX, RX and GND.

A couple of things to try on /t0:

 xmode /t0 type=80

If that doesn't improve things then try using software handshaking on the
modem (AT&K4). Still having problem, turn hand shaking off all together(AT&K0)
and see if things get better. Since your port will be faster (19.2K) than the
speed Sprintnet is pumping data, it might just work.

To really take advantage of a high speed modem you need /t3 or /t4.

Ah, Steve, it's /t1 that's the brain-dead three wire serial port. It was really
intended to have the Midi paddle on it. According to the Tech manual, /t2 is
much like /t0, except that it supports one additional line; RTS.
  Alas, I can not really help Ted more. The very first thing I did when I put
the v32 modem on the mm/1 was to modify the /t1 paddle to be /t3. Never tried
it on the lesser ports.

I had /T0 hooked up with hardware handshakeing when I still had a CoCo
hooked to my MM/1 as a terminal... the first step is setting type=80.Then you
also need to wire your cable funny (or make an adaptor). I _think_ you
described the cable changes correctly...

I't worked OK... but A) there were problems on the CoCo's end, due to the
6551 ACIA having funky CTS behavior.. and B) I'm not all too sure the
MM/1 driver was totally up to snuff.

The absolute solution for high speed modem operation use is to use
the /T3 or /T4 ports.

Yeah, there is a way, and you've basically described it.  With some different
xmode setting for those ports, you can get hardware handshaking of a sort.
Whether or not this will work with a HS modem I don't know.  Probably not.
You only get one handshaking line and the modem really needs two...one
from the modem to the computer and another from the computer to the modem.

mentions a utility called VRN. Although its not essential, this utility
would make the graphics smoother according to the docs. I checked the
applications DB here and can't find it. Does anyone know where I can obtain
this utility? Its written by Bruce Isted. Any help would be appreciated.
   If anyone is on the fence about this game, go for it... It is first
quality and well thought out. I thought it would be a carbon of ARKANOID
but it is not. There are some nice features here that are miles ahead of
that game. Even without VRN, the graphics are first rate. With VRN, I
can't say yet but its hard to see how it could be better. I would like
to find out. Thanx Alan! Now lets see some more good games, I'll buy 'em.

FYI
After reading Mark Griffith's review of the accelerator board in the latest

had put in ROM and the modules that came in the CMDS directory I decided
to do a ident on each module in each of the locations. Here is what I

Joel,

  > Would people pay attention to the standards?

    Well, in order for me to follow any standard I would have to consider it to
be at least as good as the method I would use should the standard not exist,
and it would have to be as easy to implement.

    For example, quite awhile ago I was designing another GUI for the MM/1,
(this was before I decided that having yours and Mike's available was enough.)
Chet Simpson and I were working on our own "standard" for MM/1 icons, and had
talked Mike into revising Desktop to conform to it. Unfortunately we never
completed it. It supported variable sized icons, animated icons, shadowed
icons, icons which included sound, and some other things. Now say there was a
standards committee and they decided on a standard for all OSK GUI icons. If
that standard did not include EVERYTHING that our icon format did ,(and if I
was still developing this GUI,) then I wouldn't even give it a second glance.

    The problem with standards is that they sometimes have the tendency to
cater to the lowest common denominator. For OS9 that might mean developing
standards which would have to be useable on a terminal. That would be
unacceptable. This in a way describes my biggest fear about the MM/1 users
adopting G-Windows as our standard. I don't know enough about GW to be sure
but the fear is that software would be written so that it could run on the
least capable system possible, like DOC programmers writing software so that
the 8088, or at least the 286 would be required to run it. (Oops, make that
DOS programmers!) Since there are a number of systems out there whose graphic
abilities can surpass the MM/1 that wouldn't be a big deal, but what about
sound? If you wrote Write Right! for G-Windows would it still have the ability
to use a variety of sounds, like that pleasing chime? This is a small example,
but its often the small things that make a program a winner. Most importantly,
as I understand it, G-Windows really needs the highest res screen to run, and
I've been told that it doesn't support lower res screens. *IF* this is true
then I couldn't use it to write for the MM/1's 256 color modes. Also
unacceptable.

    Standards should give the ability to create portable software, but they
shouldn't prevent, or even discourage programmer's use of each machine's
unique special capabilities.

    Considering the general lack of software that's being complained about in
the first place I don't its a good idea to promote avoiding ANY software as
long as it works and does what its supposed to.

    If it came down to it, would you rather have 100 top-notch programs which
conformed to no standards, or 5 pretty good but not as versatile programs
which conformed to all the standards?

    Granted if the standards are comprehensive enough the programs could be
just as versatile, but still would you want to chase ANY of the FEW developers
away just because they chose not to follow your "standards"? Also, how often
are standards actually as comprehensive as stand-alone super-program formats?

I agree on points about standards but threre are reasons to implement them as
well.  While you as a programmer may not use them in every case IF there is a
set of standard ways to do things you will likely follow them when possible.
You can also develop a "standard program" and add the bells and whistles to
specific versions for platforms that can support them.  A Standards committee
need not be confined or delegated to programming eother.  There is a proposal
for one and until I get more info I'll keep an open mind about it.

 Actually the standards can be as simple as the one more or less being taken
for granted in the MS-DOS world right now.  Hit the F1 key for a help menu.
Even Word Perfecrt supports this now. (I think)  As stated before, standards
aren't neccessarily bad.  It is also up to the programmeers as to how closely
they follow them.  An excellent example is UNIX.  Many C programs have been
ported from UNIX with a minimal rewrite of code.  These are extremely well
written (in a lot of csases) powerful programs.  I say let's hear out the
entire discussion on standards and then make a decision and not speculate on
whether or not it will happen this way or not.

    This is very true. The question is, how many programmers will do this, and
how many will stop at the "standard program"? Not to say I would blame a
programmer for doing so, since customizing various versions for the different
machines might prove to take too much time and not be financially beneficial
to said programmer. Customizing a program to the system which the programmer
owns would be much easier to code and to test, and might be less apt to happen
should the programmer be writing a standard version.

    I agree. Discussion has never hurt anyone, anyone who is reasonable, that
is. In fact, I even agree with the development of standards. However, my fear
now is the same as it was when this was a big topic earlier this year. Some
of the ideas tossed about seemed to head towards the idea that everything
needed to be designed with the use of terminals in mind. Although there is
some definite merit to this idea, I fear that it would have the effect of
undermining the development of more preferrable (in my opinion) windows based
software. Those aren't the kind of standads I want to see.

    What kind would I like to see? Well, besides the icon standard I'd been
working on, I had done work on developing my own clipboard "standard". It
supports clipping graphics screens, text segments, audio segments, and even
integrated sound/animation segments. I've yet to write a program which needed
to use such a standard, so its never seen the light of day. But this is the
kind of standard I think needs to be developed. What chance do you think there
is of such a standard being developed if everyone is concerned with maintaining
compaibility with evry OSK system, in particular those using terminals?

    Maybe I'm wrong, in fact I hope I am. Maybe there's room for some more
basic standards as you mentioned, and also room for some more advanced
standards like I'm talking about. We shall see. *IF*, however, it came down
to a choice of seeing softare which followed those more basic standards *or*
seeing software which followed more advanced MM/1 specific standards, I'd take
the latter.

The ultimate reductio ad absurdum of that argument would claim that people
shouldn't be writing all these programs that assume interactivity, because
it keeps one from buying and using cheap keypunches and card readers.  (I
haven't priced them, so I can't say for sure that they're cheap--but I
would think that you couldn't give them away these days.)  One could even
point to a bunch of software--editors, SCCS-like programs, MUSIC V--written
for batch operation on mainframes.  Bring back IEFBR14!  NOT.

That said, there *is* an argument for flexibility.  A blind user doesn't
have too much use for a GUI, and for that matter, there's something to be
said for making it easy for *another program* to use programs.  It would
be nice if programs could be written as modules that do the dirty work and
communicate with a replaceable interface module of one's choice, be it
[A-Z]-Windows, a curses-driven display, or whatever (a serial connection
to another machine, perhaps?).

The point is that it is strictly up to you as a programmer to decide whether
you'll add the bells and whistles.  There are many programs that were written
on another platform and OS that give you options for graphics (CGA, EGA, VGA,
etc.)  I think you get my drift.  If you use the lowest common denominator then
some functions are not available to you but you can still run the bare program.
The point is the bells and whistles were added because they help sell a product
to the higher end crowd but the main program is designed to sell to everyone.

Eric, I hope that the developer will participate in this simply because they
want to.   But they also have to realize that if we're to survive at all,
mainstreming plays an important role.  Support for more DOS and MAC file types
is a must.   The most impo
rtant new development promoted by the MM/1 is the use of IFF, and WAV files.
And that should just be a start.   The other need is for decreased development
time.   Most of us both program AND run our businesses, and that is a tough row
to hoe.  It's much
 of the reason for the sparcity of software.   If you've noticed, even those
who gripe the loudest about a lack of software are not very quick about adding
to the available titles.   Why is that??   Perhaps a standards organization
could help to fix that p
roblem.   Nor need the standards be confining.   That is one reason I propose
an ongoing process, centered in  a branch of the OS9 Users Group.   If you're
worried about confinement - check out the ANSI C standard.   I've not noticed
the standard keeping a
nyone from extending the language, or work from getting done.

    That *could* be a nice way for things to be, as long as the program
contained ALL the modules it needed to be complete, (I tend to agree with the
guy who got jumped on here several months ago for saying that he didn't like
OS-9 programmers' ways of saying "Here's my term program. If you want buffer
capture then save to disk and use your favorite editor! If you want to use
xmodem for downloading jump to another window and use your favorite x-protocol
program! If you want zmodem switch to another window..." I'll take Ultimaterm
any day.) Also, the fact that the program exists in modules needs to be
transparent to the user, should they so desire.

    Despite OS-9's power, *I* think some of the ways we tend to use (misuse)
th OS's abilities obscure the benefits of the OS, especially when compared
to the *complete*, (albeit out of necessity,) programs found on single-tasking
systems, even RS-DOS.

    True. But consider this possibility. In orer to convince the few people in a

smaller market to buy your program you have to put in all the bells and
whistles you can. Expand hat market through use of a cross-platform windowing
system, and maybe you can sell enough copies of the more bare program without
having to add all the bells and whistles in for each version of the program and
still turn a hefty profit without all the extra work.

    Now, of course this is only a possibility. The one factor that could
completely invalidate the argument is competition. If the expanded market
creates competition then each programmer will have to make his program as good
as possible in order for it to survive. But in oir marketplace, what's the
odds of sch a competitive struggle taking place? (I really need to do
something about all these typos!) Hopefully I'm wrong, but I'd say slim and
none.

David,

    All very good points, and I hope you're correct. Some flexible standards
which allowed for a little flavor to remain in the software would surely be a
positive thing. Hopefully competition will develop which will prevent my fear
of "plain vanilla programs" from becomming a reality.

    As far as standards go, I would first like to see a position taken on one
aspect of the OS-9 programming community. We often hear the word mainstream
used as a place we ought to be. Well, in the mainstream, probably because, ok,
entirely becuas the mainstream is full of single-tasking systems, we see
programs which are entirely self-contained, meaning no outside utilities or
other programs are needed to make one program complete. In the OS-9
community we have a habit of doing just the opposite. Some may call it
re-inventing the wheel in every program, but if we want to enter this
"mainstream" it is my opinion that mainstream users (myself included) will
demand the same type of self contained, self sufficient software that is found
on single-tasking systems. In other words, a marketable terminal program will
need to have buffer capture (this *may* be an option, but probably not),
xmodem, ymodem, zmodem, and whatever other popular protocols that there are,
*built into* the program, not only accessible using outside programs in
another window.

    Are we willing to do the things necessary to enter the "mainstream"?

There's completeness and there's completeness.

To go back to the infamous example: if I get into Ultimaterm and go
looking through the capture buffer, can I easily search for the line
that matches a certain regular expression, or select a range of lines,
sort them, and save the sorted result to a file?  I am not now, nor
have I ever been, a Disk BASIC user :-), so I can't say for sure, but I
think not.  Those are trivial tasks with common Unix editors that have
been ported to OS-9.

Someone specifically writing an editor is sure to do a better job of it
than someone writing something that will get by as part of a larger program;
people, to put it mildly, get accustomed to their favorite editor.  (Just
read the emacs/vi flamage on the net if you doubt that.)  Why make people
relearn whatever makeshift facilities people come up with as part of an
attempt to write a "complete" program?

What made OSTerm "incomplete" is that it was *not* designed with modularity
in mind, but instead, for example, rolled its own [xy]modem file transfer
routines.

    Actucally I wasn't referring to running the desktop in that mode. I agree
that it needs the max resoulution. I was just wondering if the G-library
supports a standard set of screen resolutions compatible with every platform,
or if it supports every res/colors combination of the particular machine its
being run on.

    Good, then you can answer a question which recently came to mind. Does
G-Windows support some kind of clipboard standard? If so, and I guess you
would have to have the developer's pack to know this, how comprhensive of a
standard is it?

functions of telecommunicating? Look at the response of an average single-
tasker. They seem to want software (and so do I) which is stand alone. If we
want to attract these people then we have to respect their wishes. I would
never want to take away your ability to use whatever means you prefer to do
your buffer captures and file transfers, but I think we should also support
those who prefer to have these features built into the programs they use.

That's a false dichotomy.  If the application is properly written, then
the average user doesn't have to know that an operation is being implemented
by spawning another process.

    I totally agree. However I think what you meant is not quite what you said,
and I'm agreeing with things that follow from what you actually said.

    If the average user doesn't know that a supplemental process is being used,
then that other process would also have to be written by the same programmer as
the main program, since the couldn't include and use someone else's text editor
or x/y/z protocol with their program. This fits my definition of a complete
program. If you want to use other, better stand-alone programs to perform
certain functions, fine, more power to you. If, however, you don't want to do
so, then you shouldn't be forced to.

    As you seem to be promoting some more graphically inclined features of the
MM/1, I think one of the first things that should be done is that the MM/1
programming community needs to get together and figure out what windowing
system were going to support, and then develop and/or agree on some standards
for window useage, such as a clipboard standard, an icon standard, a filepicker
standard (such as the one Mike includes in the C library), a sound standard
(there are several out there, which one should we use?), amd an animation
standard. THEN we can worry about developing some general cross-platform OSK

KVED is an excellent example of what you are talking about. It is a graphical
front end to the editor VED from Bob van der Poel. KVED was written by Ken
Scales. Of course, KVED would be pretty useless to anyone who does not have
a copy of VED, and not just any copy, since the two programs must work very
closely together KVED assures that the version of VED you have is compatible
with it. So, since KVED is pretty useless by itself, Ken never bothered to
try and market it. What he did do was make an arrangement with Bob van der
Poel such that KVED is not distributed with VED and if you have an MM/1 (VED
works on ANY OSK platform, since it uses TERMCAP) and like GUI's you are
free to use KVED. I do not know if Ken is getting a piece of the action from
VED sales (I think he should!) but that is between him and Bob.

Another example is a projecttI am working on and hope to have ready for
holiday delivery. There is a version of GNU Chess which was ported to OSK. It
has a very crude user interface, displaying the chess board setup with ASCII
characters like p, k, Q and R. Periods, . , indicate empty squares. And to
input a move you enter something like e3e4. I have written a graphical
front end to GNU Chess for the MM/1 (well writing one, that is). It draws
a chess board on your MM/1 monitor using full color graphics. Pieces are
moved by pointing and clicking the mouse. It has the standard MM/1 Menu
Interface designed by Mike Haaland. IMHO, it looks good. And actually
playing Chess with you in the background is a copy of GNU Chess running
in a child process with my program sending and getting data to/from it
via pipes. Since GNU Chess is freely distributable by anyone as long as
you make the sources available, I will be able to include a copy of GNU
Chess on each copy of K-Windows Chess (KChess).

I think KBCom is a good example of a program that allows flexibility of
use of outside programs, and simplicity. KBCom comes with its own
external/standalone
XModem program, which is called through KBComs Extension interface. Extensions
are easily setup for any other program, so, adding Zmodem capability to KBCom
was
a cinch, just "bind" a key to the new command to run as an extension. Eddie
was working on adding a lot of other nice features (like scroll back through
the internal Buffer that KBCom already keeps) but his MM/1 got Zapped by
lightning back in the Spring '93, and he is still waiting on it to be returned
to him
(I think Mark was real close to shipping it out last time I talked to Eddie)

I have KBCom and I know of np feature it has which can be performed by
other programs. What it does do is use external programs to do the up

KBCom is kinda set up like WizPro was, but with a much better interface
for calling external programs... To provoid download capabilities,Eddie
supplied his "XYmodem" program. XYModem is a really nice standalone
x/y/ybatch transfer program (I also use it as the transfer program for my BBS)
But, Eddie didn't include Zmodem support. But, with the callable extensions
it was easy to add zmodem support, by just definind an extension to start up
rz/sz in a window, passing watever parameters, and prompting for file names
(in the case of sz) I also have extensions for adding say a tagline to
the end of a message. I am thinking of adding a further extension that will
"grab" the current screen and save it to a temp file, start up Emacs (with the
temp file as the file) Then I can edit the grabed screen, and when I exit
Emacs, it would do a ascii dump back out the terminal port... Gee... I thik
I'll try setting that up tonight... would make it a lot easier for me to quote
and respond to messages...

Indeed, KBCOM is an excellent terminal program.  And its scripting
is very handy.  For instance, every week day morning at 3:00am
(while I'm asleep), KBCom dials up Delphi and grabs my choice of
stock quotes.  The output is loged to a file, which is then mailed

Well, The quoteing script was a hypothethical thing... I didn't actually
do it yet... I just tried to whip one up quick, and ran into two snags...
the first is, the emacs gets the screen width and height wrong, and the
second is, the "grab" hot key, always makes you type a file name (You can't
make it default to a file name) The first problems is the one that really keeps
it from working... if there is a way to pass the current screen width/height to
emacs, them maybe that would fix it... you'd just always be prompte for a
fileto save the screen in before it fired up emacs...

Hopefully, when Eddie gets working on KBcom again I can have him add some other
feaqtures to fix the problem... I know he has plans on implementing a complete
scripting language for it.

    I think just maybe we need to get our own house in order before setting out
to cure the whole community's ills. I'm not talking KWindows programmers here,
I'm talking *MM/1* programmers, (granted these 2 groups may be one and the
same.) I just think it wouldn't be to our benefit to devote time to
developing windowing standards for say GWindows when the MM/1 group might
decide to stay behind KWindows.

    Understood. And a very good point. I just don't want to be out fixing the
"OSK market as a whole" while our own little part of that market is in disarray.

I also wonder, "faster development" of what? If its generic, vanilla, cross-
platform OSK programs with no flair, then I'm really not concerned. But if its
powerful, windowed, maximized for each specific machine software, well then now
you're talking! If we can take care of our own problems and the communitiy's at
the same time, then all the better. Count me in.

    On a side note, in discussing software standards, there is one thing that's
severely disappointed me with the MM/1 software so far. And may I first state
that *I am also very guilty of doing this same thing!* We have a windowing
system with windows capable of being moved and resized. While many programs
out allow you to move them, I can't think of any that let you resize them. I
had thought that, when writing the stuff I've done, that because my programs
needed the full screen to work in, that it would be of no use allowing the
user to resize it. However, this is far from true, just look at the windowing
systems of other computer's out there. Windows can be resized for easy storage
on the screen, and you could also use the scrollbars to scroll across the full
window display.

    And before anyone says it, let me first respond to the obvious argument
against what I'm saying. "Under OS-9 you have multiple screens and therefore
you don't need the ability to move or resize windows, when you can just hot-key
from screen to screen." Well, I happen to like having multiple windows of
varying sizes on one screen. The operating system supports it, so why shouldn't
our programs let us do it? In particular, terminal programs and text editors.
It would be sensible for me to shrink my term program to say, 5 lines, and store

it at the top or bottom of the screen so I could keep an eye on the text
capture that I'm doing of the message base while I'm also editing some code in
my somewhat shrunken text editor window. As it stands right now, I don't think
the MM/1 has the programs which would allow me to do that. What a waste.

    As a programmer I'm vowing to include resizeability into any *new* software
that I develop from here on out, and as a user I'm now demanding, (ok,
demanding is a little strong, I'm asking,) that any software I purchase from
here on out give me the flexibility that I wish for and that the operating
system easily supports.

    End of sermon. Opposing arguments may start ... now.

Actually, I can think of quite a few that let you resize them, although
most are just small utilities.  I try to add resizing to all my
utilities and small games (Othello, GClock, StrMan, ViewFax, etc.), and
yes, the next version of Write-Right will even allow this.  :)

For some things, it's not bad (like text apps), but for some graphics
apps, it's very hard, since if your virtual screen is larger than your
displayed screen, and you have to FFill a region that resides partly on-
screen and partly off-screen, I think you can see the problem.  All the
windowing systems I've seen keep track of virtual screens for the
programmer, but K-Windows does not yet support this feature.  I don't
believe graphics programmers should spend their time trying to support
virtual windows, since that is something that needs to be supported in
the windowing system itself.  However, graphics that can be rescaled to
fit in varying window sizes should be supported, like the programs I

When the cgfx.l library has all of the nexessary code for handling
resizing, dynamic scoll bars and all that other stuff which is done by
the OS in MS-Windows, then I'll take advantage of them in any new program
I write.

 As others have said, while you can do some moveing and resizeing under
Kwindows, its not exactly user-friendly to do so. The K-Windows has some
problems dealing with 'windows' that are recieveing output. You can't
resize a window when thats happening. Other programmers have had to deal
with other aspects of K-Windows that need work. Until then, the only
real reason to have 19 different tiny windows on one screen is because
you only HAVE one screen. K-Windows at least handles that nicely.

    Of course not Frank. Information dispensation is always a good thing as far
as I'm concerned. In fact, it answers a question which I'd had about GWindows.
Tell me, when you shrink a GWindow, does GW allow the use of the scrollbars to
scroll around the virtal full screen? Also, can the programmer use the
scrollbars to scroll around an area larger than full screen? If bth of these
are possible, what happens when say, your program uses the scrollbars to scroll
across a sheet of music which is actually several screens long, but when the
user shrinks the program window, GW wans to use the scrollbars to scroll
around the virtual full screen. Which one wins out?

    Hope I made that example clear enough. If you're not sure what I mean, just
shout.

    Oh I'm well aware of that. In fact, twice in the last 2 - 3 years I've
tried to start discussions on how we should handle the virtual screen
scrolling thing, but no one was interested. Now it looks like we're ready to
talk anout it. Even though it wouls still be nice, I can understand if say a
game doesn't support it, as most games wouldn't even be written to run in a
window, (I'm writing one right now and I know I'm not even thinking about
trying to have it run in a window, much less one that can be resized.) But
there are just some things, (term progs, word pros, DBs, etc...) that should
be done in resizeable windows, and the extra code to handle scaling the text
output to the window size just wouldn't be that much.

Yes it does. As a matter of fact the scroll bars are proportional to
the amount of the window you are looking at. By that I mean that by
looking at the scroll bar area you can see about what size the actual
window is compared to what you are looking at. (There must be an
easier way to say this)... whatever... it's pretty neat.

 > Can the programmer use the scrollbars to scroll around an area larger

I >think< so??? You determine the size of the virtual window and the
size of the actual window when you open it. (Even where it appears
on the screen) I don't have the docs here to really answer you.
Perhaps someone else who is using GW can answer that and the other
question.

    First, I'd really like to know what you mean by "necessary code", since
K-Windows allows you to resize, and find out what the new window size is, I
don't think anything else is "necessary", helpful, but definitely not
necessary.

    Second, I've written my own dynamic scrollbars routines before, and it
really didn't take much time or effort to do so. Mike has also done this in
his get_dir routine, and he didn't find it very hard either. I realize some
of the code involved in writing for resizeable windows is long and complicated,
but dynamic scrollbars isn't one of those things.

    Finally, I agree that it would be nice if the windowing system handled more
of the work, but I don't think its realistic for us to expect our windowing
system to be quite as dynamic as MS-Windows. After all, as we're all quite
aware, we arn't exactly in the mainstream here, and what Kevin/the new KW
programmer got/will get out of their efforts falls FAR short of what the
Microsoft programmer got for his efforts. In our market, the programmer is
simply goig to have to work a little harder, its a fact of life we have to live
with, unless we institute David Graham's idea of writing this code and
incorporating it into libraries available to everyone. As Joel pointed out,
resizing support is available in several programs. Those programmers didn't
find it an impossible task, why should the rest of us? (Myself included)

    See my message 83481 to Zack.

    As Joel has pointed out, several programs out there do support resizing.
It is true that for some programs, the extra code needed to do so would be
almost overwhelming, especially if you run into K-Windows problems. But for
many program, supporting resizing would not be all that much of a
Herculean effort. With all the current talk about us developing mainstream
quality software, I think making this extra effort will be a must.

Eric,
I have been following your talk about Bloatware for a while
here.  I think there is a proper way to get a program that
uses outside resources built.  As a general rule, I don't like
it when I have to open another shell and use the command line
to start a utility that should have been part of the program.
An example would be in 6809 Osterm, where I had to either start
up a shell or hot-key to another window to start Zmodem.  In the
programer's defense, there are many protocols and it is hard to
keep up with them all.  On my OSK machine, I am using Sterm, which
is indeed a Simple Terminal program.  But, in this case, the
Zmodem protocol is called from a simple keypress sequence even
though the Zmodem program is external to Sterm.  I believe this
is acceptable and even preferable to putting the Zmodem code
directly in the terminal program.  Adding new options is easy,
even for a user without the development system,  if the
application is in graphical mode under G-Windows by adding the
download protocol to the custom menu.

My vote is to have the programs modular but to lobby
for better program designs that make the modularity
invisible to the normal user.

I say this because the group that frequents this forum
and even the other forums represent a very tiny percentage
of the total customer base for OS9 and OSk products.  Are you
going to set standards for CD-I?  Industrial users? Telecommunications?
Embedded systems?  Etc, Etc...

First, get the User's Group built up and include more than
50 to 100 hobbyists in it.  When you have a representative
group of paid professional programmers on board, then we can
consider talk of standards.  I suspect we don't know what
the "market" is yet.  Let's research that first.  Lets get
more OS9 users from all areas involved in the User's group
first.

Yes you can use Gwindows to scroll across an object larger
than even a full screen!  I have a 1024x768 Gif that I can
view using the HGwindows scroll bars.  It's about two CRT's
wide by about 1-1/2 CRT's high. ( should have been Gwindows above,
not HGwindows..ughh).

I had a couple of local OS/2 users over last week.
They liked a lot of what they saw in Gwindows.  There
are some similarities between OS/2 Presentation

 Yes.  You can also write to any part of the screen whether it's displayed or
 not and the screen can be set up to automatically buffer whatever is written
 or drawn to it.

 >can the programmer use the scrollbars to scroll around an area larger
 >than full screen?

 Again, Yes.  There is an upper limit on the size of a screen.  For normal,
 buffered text (terminal emulation) the limit is (I think) 160 columns by 96
 rows.  I don't know what the upper limit for non-emulation screen is but
 it's at least two or three times teh size of my screen (800 X 600).

 Hmmmmm.  Never tried this but, based on experience with other aspects of the
 windowing system, I'd say itwould probably be up to the application which
 would 'win out'.  Since G-Windows will, if instructed, notify an application
 whenever a scroll event occurs, the program can decide how it wants to treat
 it.  If the application or user changes the visible section of the virtual
 screen, G-Windows will automatically update the scroll bars.

Eric,

My idea it that if programmers share development of those parts fo a program
that
are essentially the same regardless of display system, then we acelerate
development across the board.   IE - several developers develope a DBase IV
compabtible file library, and a DBASE language interpreter.   They then
seperately use these components to
develop competing products.   One is standard TTY, the other may be Termcap or
termlib compatible, and others may be based on GWindows ro KWindows.   But the
products are there for consumers, to speed system sales, which then speeds
software sales, and pay
s you to upgrade the program.

Allen, first off, the professional programmers you speak of need a reason to
join.  A standards group is one sort of thing that could draw them.  Secondly,
the 'hobbyists' you speak of include people interested in makeing a living
selling OS9 hardware and software.  It includes people interested in BUYING OS9
stuff.   What makes you think these people alone aren't worth an effort to
develope standards.   You

I agree.  My view on this whole thread is that "implementation" should
not be the primary issue:  Usability (user-friendliness) and Functionality
should be the first concerns.  Software re-use by using "outside resources"
is a powerful capability of OS-9 that we can apply to accelerate availability
of well-rounded applications.  But we must consider the "user" perspective.

Yes, it would be pretty well impossible for an individual to keep a
program current with the latest "state of the art".  The industry moves very
quickly.  Consider archivers:  there is a nearly continuous
stream of programs providing enhanced functionality.

Yes.  The "Usability" factor has been satisfied.  The operation is
essentially "seemless" to the user, but the "Functionality" is there.
By using the external Zmodem program, the programmer has significantly
enhanced the basic program.  Effectively, a "plug-in" extension.

As another example, the upcoming release of OSTerm 68K (unfortunately
K-Windows only for now) will also feature the ability to use external
protocols (e.g., Zmodem).  The external protocol is available from
the Transfer menu, and file selection uses the standard OSTerm filepicker
facilities.  If Zmodem had to be re-written for inclusion in OSTerm 68K
then we probably wouldn't see it released in the forseeable future....

    Acceptable I can agree with, but I don't know that I'd go as far as to say
"preferrable." Then again, I don't really think it matters one bit, as long as
the method of implementation is completely transparent to the user, unless the
user decides to use a different Zmodem program, or whatever.

It does have scaletext()  (I believe that's what it's called), but it's
very difficult to control in some instances.  I explored using it in my
page preview routine for Write-Right!, but after a few tests, I wrote my
own code.  :)

 Eric,

 To answer a couple questions you have raised regarding G-WINDOWS.

 In an earlier message to Allen (AJMLFCO), you asked whether G-WINDOWS
 could support images, etc. of resolutions other than that currently in use.
 The answer is yes.  Example - suppose you are in a 800x600x256 mode. You
 can view any image of 800x600x256 or less in its entirety on the screen.  If
 the image is 320x200x16, it will simply use only a portion of the screen -
 slightly less 25% and not use the full CLUT.  If the image is larger, say
 1024x768x256, than most of it will appear on the screen.  Using the horizontal
 and vertical scroll bars, you can view other portions of the image.  However,
 if the image uses more than 256 colors, say some of the newer 24 bit stuff,
 G-WINDOWS will return an error message informing you it doesn't not know how
 to display the image.  G-WINDOWS can only handle 256 colors maximum.  Caveat -
 not all implementations of G-WINDOWS can handle 256 colors.  Some of the
 implementations are for 16 colors and it is possible to do a 2-color port
 (monochrome), also.  Of course, these implementations cannot display 256
 color images, either.

 When you open most windows in G-WINDOWS, a 'draw buffer' (the G-WINDOWS term
 for what has been called 'virtual window' here) is also created.  Most of
 the time, it is the same size as the maximum size of the window.  Even if
 you resize the window so it is smaller, the draw buffer remains the same size.
 This permits the user to 'scroll' through the draw buffer to view its
 contents.  It also permits writing to a portion of the window which may
 not be selected for viewing.

 When an application is written for G-WINDOWS, it can take advantage of the
 'auto draw buffer' capability.  I did this when I wrote 'VIEW FAX' for Joel
 Hegberg's ETHAFAX which I showed in Atlanta.  While most faxs are of a speci-
 fied width, they can vary in length.  Rather than attempt to create a worst-
 case draw buffer (very wasteful of memory), I used the 'auto draw buffer'
 capability.  The size of the buffer is determined by the incoming data and is
 independent of the window size.  A side note on this - it is possible to
 scale the image to view the entire message on one screen.  However, some
 information/detail may be lost especially if the scaling ratio is high as
 might be required for some of the lower resolution implementations of
 G-WINDOWS.

 You asked whether G-WINDOWS supports some kind of a 'clipboard standard'.
 I'm not sure what you mean.  If you are referring to clip-art, a conversion
 routine for GIF files does come with G-WINDOWS.  And, I'm working on conver-
 sion routines to convert most of the other popular gfx formats to G-WINDOWS
 format.  Along this line, I've finished a conversion routine to convert HPLJ
 soft fonts to G-WINDOWS format and will do one for TRUE-TYPE soft fonts later.

I think so, but IMHO, if I understand what you're saying, it's not the
behavior I'd personally like to see.  What I'd like to see is this:

I have a shell running in a window, and at the shell prompt I type

less woof.c

For some reason, while less is in mid-run, I decide to resize the
window.  After I resize the window, if I type space at the less
running in the window, I want less's notion of what another
"screenful" of woof.c is to reflect *the number of lines displayed
in the resized window*.

This takes work; what it really means is that less has to be notified
of the change and potentially change, for example, the value of its
TERMCAP environment variable.  Alas, it probably means that some signal
would have to be dedicated to the purpose and a list of programs
interested in being notified of window size changes be kept somewhere.

Opinions expressed herein are those of their respective authors, and
not necessarily those of any organization.

    Remember, the more information you dispense on GWindows finer attributes

Jim,
One of the demos that comes with GWindows (called 'boxes' I think)
does just that. When you resize the window the demo changes to fit.
I guess this means that you could do what you want in a text window.
But as it comes up it just shows you a piece of the window when you
make it smaller. Ahhh another thing to play with. Actually I think
I like your comments. It would be rough reading some things that
are formatted for 80 chars tho, like a dir -e.

 What you want to do can be done but 'less' (and any other applications
 you want to respond as you describe) would have to be re-written.  'less'
 and most (all?) programs that access 'termcap' or other files to obtain
 size (and other) information, do so only once - when the program is first
 started.

 When a window is resized, a signal is sent (actually an 'event') and the
 new window size is available.  It is possible to write a 'wrapper' for 'less'
 and other apps that would send specific information to the apps when certain
 events occur.  Of course, the apps would have to be able respond to this
 information.  The problem is not one of G-WINDOWS but rather, the apps.
 Apps could be written and/or modified so they can run in either 'native' mode
 or under G-WINDOWS and take advantage of G-WINDOWS capabilities.  I suspect a
 real ambitious programmer could write an application running under native
 mode, G-WINDOWS and K-WINDOWS, at least for text based stuff without
 requiring different versions for each <g>.

Sigh.  Quoting from my messages 15737/8 on the CIS OS-9 forum (July/92),
which were replies to Kevin D's request for input on K-Windows:

 "c) Signals when window changed:  I would like to see codes similar to
     _ss_dcon() and _ss_dcoff() to enable and disable sending of a signal to
     a process when its window has been changed/resized (default, no signal,
     of course).  It would have been really nice (and easy) to have been able
     to put support for these in my "sc" and "ispell" ports."

As far as I know, these haven't been added.  So the K-Windows programmer
must keep checking the current window size to see if it has changed.

 > When a window is resized, a signal is sent (actually an 'event') and the
 > new window size is available.

Using events (G-Windows) is a much tidier approach.  Neat.

It should be pretty simple to make a resizable G-Windows version of 'sc',
so that the spreadsheet changes to reflect the resized window size.
(The original source already understands the Unix SIGWINCH signal.)

 > Of course, the apps would have to be able respond to this information.

Right.  And if there were a simple method of managing it, I am sure more
programmers would build it into their applications.  So, how many more
orders do you need to proceed with the MM/1 G-Windows port?

Ken,
A few months ago, I got a phone call from an old
college buddy of mine.  He works for a large industrial
company (Aluminum smelter).  He was really excited to find
out that I was familair with OS9.  Seems they they built a lot of their
own control systems using OS9.  They had recently seen a
demonstration of G-Windows and were quite impressed.  They
were also looking for less expensive hardware to use for
development in the office.  I sent him copies of various
adds from the Underground, etc.  Hopefully, one of our
vendors here hade a sale.  The point is that a lot of these
guys don't know that there are terminal programs, editors,
games (be sure to put a "supervisor" button in it!), graphics
editors, etc. available.  The trick is to determine what they
need and then figure out how to meet the need.  The USER's
group should help with that.  Another thing..don't standardize
on something of no use to the real user base of OS9, the
real-time controls market.

re: 83528

Unfortunately, GWindows is more  like OS/2 or MS-Windows
where the text is cropped when the window is smaller than the text
display.  You have to scroll right/left/up/down to view it.
Desqview/X has "scalable fonts" which re-size to suit the
window---neat but a load on the cpu (otherwise known as slow).
Once DV/X get the fonts re-scaled, things go quick, though.
It might be possible for the programmer to detect the window
size in Gwindows and adjust to one of the  three loaded "Qfonts"
on the fly.  I don't have the developer's kit so I can't
check that out.

Allen, my aim it to duplicate DOS file structures, and , in some cases,
programming languages, while retaining features that take advantage of OS9.
And, then, we can attract people who want simultaineously developed superior
features, and that will  allow us to acheive some penetration into the small

 Allen,

 In a standard 'shell' window, (the one you see when you start G-WINDOWS,
 use cntl-s or the menu to start new windows) you can have only one of the
 three quick fonts.  The window file manager reads the environment file
 to determine which size font to use.  The window is sized accordingly.

 In a 'custom' window, (one which runs an app written under G-WINDOWS),
 the programmer or, if he allows, the user may select any of the fonts
 in the FONTS directory or any of the quick fonts.  This may be done on
 the fly.  You may have different faces, styles, sizes - whatever is available
 and suits your fancy.  Some of the software we're writing permits all of the
 above plus hierogliphics or handwriting if you chose.  Currently, I'm working
 on a set of fonts which will contain 'clip-art' for inclusion in documents.

        >>Chris, then if the standards come out WITH the applications
   then we won't have to redevelop everything later.........

        Well that is a good point. I just don't know if we would be
   starting too  early in the game. Maybe starting out with a set of
   standards as a foundation, and then as more software is developed,
   adding to that set as we go along might be the right idea? Is that
   what you are saying? The thing I'm thinking about right now is, at
   this point we can probably think of a few standards that will most
   likely need to be set anyway, so yes, we could take care of those
   right off the bat. While I'm not personally as informed with this
   stuff as those of you using OSK, a few things come to my head. One is
   deciding what directories would be expected to be found on a hard
   disk<SYS,CMDS,DATA, etc> so we could get some of the common
   directories standardized. I still believe programs should be flexible
   enough so that the user can place them and other files in whatever
   directory they please, but the author should also have standard
   default directories he can use to start with, while allowing the user
   to put things wherever he wants with a configuration program. This
   will allow easy startup as well as flexibility. Another idea is to
   have all the machines keep the same Keyboard setup so that all the
   keys, including and especially function keys will equal the same thing
   on all machines<on plain non windows OSK setup. I imagine the Gwindows
   and Kwindows environment can do it their way>.  I don't know if this
   is already taken care of, so I just mentioned it just in case. I think
   it would be a good idea to get a graphics library developed and
   distributed with OSK, similar to GFX2, for Basic. I understand once
   the MM/1 is back in production, BGFX will be getting finished up. That
   will be great, but I think there should probably be something similar
   distributed with OSK, so it will be easier to develop Basic programs
   that will run on all machines<even if the machine itself doesn't come
   with basic>. Then comes the subject of Termcaps,PrintCaps and all that
   other stuff I don't really know anything about. I guess the committee
   would decide what goes into the termcap files, but then again, maybe
   termcaps is fine as is. I only mentioned it because I've heard a lot
   about it, especially it seems, when standards are discussed. Would
   this also be the time to decide on what Windowing systems should be
   considered 'standard'<IF there should even be a 'standard' windowing
   system>? I remember being in conference a short while back with Steve
   Rottinger who was explaining to me about API's and how it is used in
   the Clone and I guess Mac world. I never heard about such a thing
   before that, but it sounds like a killer idea. It would be better to
   just have something like that, which sounds like a Graphics Termcap,
   which will run any program in whatever GUI you wish. Would such a
   thing likely be developed in the not too distant future, or would it
   be a MAJOR programming effort<as it sounds>? I still don't know much
   about it, so if there is more to it<API's> please let me in on it ;-)
        I think after a small base is developed, and as more software
   comes out, people will be able to think of more standards that will
   need to be set. It just sad that we will probably have more software
   standards than software for sometime <grin>

Good point, and my basic reason for NOT having a standards committee in

 David,

 > Allen, my aim it to duplicate DOS file structures, ...

 What is the advantage of the DOS file structure vs the OS9 file structure?
 From experience, I can assure you the OS9 file structure is more robust
 than DOSs.  If you need to read/write DOS disks, we already have PCF provided
 by MW.

 > ... in some cases, programming languages, ...

 Today, most DOS apps are written in one of the flavors of ANSII C or C++.
 We have Ultra-C for OS9 and OS-9000.  It is ANSII compliant and the latest
 version appears pretty solid.  What other programming languages would you add?

 > ..  that will  allow us to acheive some penetration into the small business
 > market.

 I don't see how languages or file structures will help.  We need the gp
 aps.  Otherwise, this is a tough nut to crack - I've tried - unsuccessfully.
 Only sold 2 POS systems using OS9.  However, I've sold many running under
 UNIX - but these were not 'mom-pop' operations, either.

 Before trying for this market, I'd suggest you look at the software already
 being offered.  For example, Real World puts out a package which starts at
 a few hundred dollars.  As more capability is needed, the user can buy
 additional modules.  When he is ready to expand, he can go into networking
 or UNIX - still under Real World.  Incidently, Real World and some of their
 competitors put out some very good packages, provide excellent support and
 can point to the many thousands (hundreds of thousands?) of satisfied users.
 One other point you should consider; most small businesses, when selecting
 their software package, will seek the advice of their accountant.  Your
 ultimate data structure will have to conform to what they use.  For what its
 worth, I've found it easier to compete against IBM, NCR, WANG and the other
 providers of more sophisticated and expensive software/hardware (but not

 If we're to compete in the general MSDOS/UNIX market, aside from the obvious
 gp programs, I think we need the capability of importing/exporting files to
 the more popular MSDOS/UNIX programs.  Most have some sort of proprietary
 compression/data structure.

 Chris,

 I don't believe this commuity is ready (mature enough) to establish standards.
 However, we might consider something along the line of 'recommended practices'.

 I won't try to address all the points you made; some are very good but others
 assume (almost) identical hardware.

 MW distributes Professional OS-9 with a recommended directory structure.
 Most OEM's conform to this.  Tandy didn't in the CoCo.

 Not really necessary.  We have termcap to take care of this problem.  Besides,
 I don't think you'd be able to convince the terminal mfgs they should conform.
 G-WINDOWS does not define the output of the keyboard.  This is determined
 by the OEM of the machine.

 Whether assembler, C or Basic, gfx are peculiar to the specific hardware.
 As things stand now, there isn't anyway to get a single verions of 'BGFX'
 to work across all the platforms.  However, if the OEM's would get together,
 It just might be possible to come up with something like a GFX termcap as
 you suggest.  However, to keep the speed up, it would probably be better
 to attach it to the kernel; i.e., each hardware implemenation would have
 a P(n) attached to the kernel peculiar to that implementation.  It would
 respond to a standard set of gfx calls.

 > Would this also be the time to decide on what Windowing systems should be
 > considered 'standard'<IF there should even be a 'standard' windowing
 > system>?

 I don't believe the UG would be able to make such a recommendation nor do
 I believe they should.  This is one area the market should be left to make
 the decision.

 I think the 'standards committee' must be very careful in what it does.
 It does not represent the entire OS-9 community.

 Help!  Some given, some asked for.
     I finally found out why cc_2_5_0 wouldn't use the ramdisk.  In this
 case I may be at fault, as I can't recall if I had re-compiled it, or was
 running the actual downloaded code. However I do have it using the /r0
 device for scratch files once again. I thought I was using the latest
 cstart.r module available, but somehow the one in my /dd/libs dir wasn't
 the one posted here as "cstart.ar".  I got it, re-compiled cc_2_5_0, and it
 works now.  The other (replacement) cstart.r apparently was munging the Y
 register and destroying access to any strings that might have been
 contained in your .r files at link time.  This may also be why I couldn't
 get the newer versions of rz/sz (3_24) to work. Time to check that needed
 too.  So if you are not using that cstart.r, and seem to have string
 problems with your C code, get it (cstart.ar), you'll like it!
     Like others here, I've not been too bashful about grabbing any
 programmers tools made available, however my source is Delphi only, no
 internet connections have been enabled.
     Because of that, and the fact that I hear "ansifront" is now up to
 version .9, I need someone to go retrieve the latest version and post it
 here if perms can be obtained.  The latest posting here is .6.  Thats by
 Vaughn Cato I think, and my thanks to whoever goes after it.
     How 'bout them 'err's? Look out BC, we'll be there friday.

Thanks very much for leaving such a long and detailed message, but I think
my query was as to whether you can run a disk with an interleave factor
of 2 with a system that has some disks and the device driver coded for
an interleave factor of 3 without screwing up the system or the disks.
Yes, I know I can use "dmode" to change the interleave factor, but to do this
every time you put a diiferently formatted disk in is a hassle.

You're going to have to experiment on that one! Use DMODE to change the
interleave on a couple disks, then reboot with your standard system.
I don't think there will be a problem, as the controller should read the disk
REGARDLESS of the interleave, it will just be slower or faster reading. I don't
think the interleave factor of the driver/controller comes into play except
during formatting....
at least that is the case with hard drives.

In a word, yes you can. I do disks here at ilv=5 for bru, then read them
back with the defualt of 3 set. Now I haven't checked specifically with the
drivers I'm using right now (Disto's SCII, native moded) but I've never had
a miss-fire from writing to a disk that had a different formatted in interleave
than what the descriptor contained at the instant. I use dmode on 2 occasions
normally, one to set the size of my ramdisk, and two to set the larger ilv
asionally if I know
a whopper file is coming in, I'll set sas=ff on the maxtor so I don't get the
segment

files.I understand from DSRTFOX that I need Tandy's EDTASM editor/assembler etc.

I use Miller's TED program occassionally but hacew no way to change fonts on
my DMP-107 printer (have not hacew), except by setting it up before I
load os-9 and TED.  I have all the patches for Supercomm and it works fine
now on Ymodem batch but still have trouble with Zmodem although I d/l'd
both SZ and RZ and placed in my CMDS file. Disregard my gripes

as I haven't used OS9 for some time now--find it easier to stick with
DTERM on DECB @ 1200 baud as 2400 has a lot of traffic.  Ray

Ray,

About your troubles with rz sz in Supercomm.  Zmodem is a continuously
streaming protocol for downloading or uploading in telecom.  If you were
using it trying to download to a diskette drive, you probably got errors
and CRC problems as you were downloading.  You must use a hard disk or
a ramdisk for good results with Zmodem.  I use a ramdisk and the new
version of rz sz available here when I run Supercomm, and I find that
Zmodem downloads are smooth and fast at 2400 baud.

Except when downloading from Delphi.  I only get the first three or four
packets streamed, then it goes into the send and wait mode.  Sheeesh.
Delphi has always been the slowest to download anything from.

perhaps CIS has faster connection/service to the packet networks... which
might explain why it is a more expensive service. I would imagine that
that Tymenet/Sprintnet offer systems like Delphi/AOL/CIS/GENIE/... different
rates for grades of network connections. Some systems may pay more to get
a higher priority on the packet network, and thus those systems get better
throughput...

Yeah, it is a "standard" MFM drive (or it was, it finally died).  I
bought it in the hope that it would be one of those older Tandy
types that would work with the "Tandy Hard Disk Controller" - which
I also bought - it didn't work, of course.  Then I got the B&B

Tar works the fastest, but it won't cross media.  This means when you
get to the end of a floptical, it will error out and stop.  You'll have
to plan your backups to do certain directories to each floptical so you
won't exceed it's capacity.

     VEF
     From: EARTHER      To: ALL

     I need to write a simple Basic09 routine to read and display VEF
files.  Does someone know the format of VEF files?  Was there ever an
article about doing this in The Rainbow?  Which issue?  Thanks.

     RE: VEF (Re: Msg 83270)
     From: MIKE_GUZZI   To: EARTHER

i posted a file called "revef" which is a basic09 program to reverse a
VEF picture. I included source code. I also extracted a segment from the
manual of multi-vue canvas which describes the VEF format. I don't think
Mike Haaland would mind if i posted that so here goes!!

Vef file information

first two bytes .. header information

Standard      Squashed    Scr type   Screen size      Colors   Size
--------      --------    --------   -----------      ------   ----
0000           8000         8         320 X 200        16      32K
0001           8001         7         640 X 200         4      32K
0003           8003         6         320 X 200         4      16K
0004           8004         5         640 X 200         2      16K

16 bytes for palette information.

Uncompressed - raw data just put it on the screen

compressed

char len  - number of bytes to read and decode to restore 1/2 scan line of
            screen data. 1/2 scan line is 80 bytes on type 7 or 8 screen.
            40 bytes for type 5 or 6. (40/80 are decimal values)

char count- compressed/uncompressed byte count.

if data is compressed:

char data          - if data is uncompressed
char data[count]   - if data is uncompressed

header data found only once in beginning of file.

to decode compressed data, read the first byte, call it len, its the lenght of
the compressed 1/2 scan line, now read 'len' bytes into the array. now we just
decode it. get 1st byte in buffer and check for high bit. it is our 'count'
byte (if high bit set
and its compressed) strip high bit and put the next byte 'count' times.
if the high bit isn't set. get the next 'count' bytes from the buffer and
put them on the screen.
This continues until you use 'len' bytes that are in the buffer. when the
buffer is decoded read then next 'len' byte from the file and do it again.
this will repeat 400 times from the file.




please note: the REVEF program i wrote does not display the VEF picture,
it creates a new file with the picture reversed horizontally. The reason
for this was to make iron-on t-shirts. If you cannot find the program I will
upload it here. But i believe I did upload it here.

     READing NEW NS
     From: JIMHRUBIK    To: ALL

A while back some folks were asking about how to read chunks of the
forum.  I've had problems with READ NEW NS, especially when /r0 would
overflow (and even a 360K floppy).  I think I have a solution for
SuperComm users who don't have a hard drive (like me).

With SuperComm running under Multi-Vue, open a shell on the GShell screen
(or anywhere else, I guess).  Start an ASCII download file and READ NEW NS.
Watch the counter for the buffer.  With my 128K ramdisk, it takes about
six 'fill-ups' to overfill my ramdisk so after the fifth flush of the
buffer, I send a CTRL-S to Delphi.  This freezes the action, and I then
use SHIFT-DN ARROW, choose ASCII capture, and close the open file.  With
the CLEAR key, jump to the open shell and copy the ramdisk file to a
floppy, delete the file in the ramdisk, and key back to SuperComm.  Use
SHIFT-DN ARROW to start another ASCII capture, and hit CTRL-Q to tell
Delphi to let 'er rip.  You can do this as many times as you need to, and
even split the download across several floppies.  It's not elegant, but
it works.

Ah. sorry if the "demo" was a little much. I get a bit silly sometimes, like
after 2am. :>
 The paddle boards are  a bit more than an extension cable, though they do that
too. The main function is to convert the TTL level signals to/from the mother
board to RS232 levels. In addition, they offer many options via jumpers. You
can configure ethe port to be DTE or DCE, and forcethe state of various lines.

With Delphi, you can try 9600, just so long as you don't send. By send, I don't
mean typing. I mean file uploads, ascii blasts, etc. The problem is lack of
any handshake. Delphi, *normally*, will not send fast enough to swamp the MM/1,
but the reverse can easily happen.

and then read it all after I'm offline most of the time. I'm online right

you can cpompose the answers offline and send them the next time you are online

Has your keyboard PIA been replaced with a standard 6821 or 6822 rather than
the LSCxxxxx chip? The only difference between the custom chip and the 6821/22
is that hte custom has pull-up resistors built in. MIKE

yep, thats the only difference is the pullups. I THINK the values used are
4.7K ohms. that could be the cause of keyboard bounce if you replaced
the PIA. since tandy no longer makes the LSC80001 chips (i think thats the
number)

    It is when uoi hit a key, and TWO chars. appear onscreen.  Hit, say, an

     Something to do with the key repeat speed or something.   Using ths system

unfortunately, I've been unable to save these settings to my boot.

     Under $1000 OSK System?
     From: DSRTFOX      To: ALL

How many people would be interested in a COMPLETE OSK system for under $1000...
probably around $900-$950 assembled? This wouldn't be a speed demon, but a
basic, entry level system. I'm thinking about assembling a few, and making
a component kit available for some savings over a fully assembled system. The
systems would carry at least a 30 day warranty. They would have monitor (CGA
or mono, most likely), keyboard, case/ps, 20-30mb hard drive (probably MFM),
10MHz 68000, 1MB RAM, and at least one 360 or 720 floppy, and OSK also.
The system would be good for those wanting to "test the waters" before buying
a more capable, faster, and expensive system, and those on a tight budget.
These sytems would also be easily upgradeable to VGA, faster CPU, etc.
I'm thinking of introducing this beginner's box in mid February. Would there
be any takers? I'll be running an assembly article in "the world of 68' micros".

Assembly will be easy, with no soldering required. If there isn't enough
interest in assembled units, I will still be interested in offering the
component kits for the magazine articles, which will include assembly AND
setting up OSK. If interested, please reply to ME in this thread!!

Frank,

Systems like this already exist if you consider the following. That the user
make use of his existing equipment such as his CoCo to use as a terminal. Two
systems are available that cost under $1000. The KiX\20 at under $700 would be
operational using the CoCo as a terminal or even buying a used terminal such
as I've seen for $50 or less. Hard drives are available for $120 and floppies
at $40. The KiX\20 can use 256K SIMS which are almost free ($7-10) Put all this
in a $50 case and you have it. The other advantage is that the user could add
the 32 bit MGA and GWindows at some future time. We've even kicked around the
thought of doing a VSC based video board so that it 'could' run K-Windows.
Don't know if there is demand for that tho.

In addition there is the CDX68X20 which sells for about $600 and OSK for
another 300. I don't think that includes BASIC like the KiX\20 but it is only
a few hundred more than the KiX. PT has the PT68K4 boards (I don't have the
price)

The point is that even at these low prices it is still more than many can
afford to come up with... at one time. What we need is a way for these guys
to get into OSK a few hundred at a time...

There IS a way to do this. Actually we're kicking around a way to get into
OSK for about $100... Anyone interested?

Mike,

Thought that might get a responce. The main, or one of the main problems
in getting a really low cost OSK system is the cost of OSK itself. We
include it in the price for the KiX's but when you see it seperate it is
usually $300 or so. The trick then is to find a 68000 based something that
has OSK as part of it and then make a board to turn it into a full blown
68K computer. Just such a device exists and it doesn't cost much. As a
matter of fact most people could justify its cost as a family purchase
rather than a computer for themselves. Of course I'm talking about a CD-I
player. They have a 15Mhz 68070 and TWO VSC chips, a Meg of RAM and a CD
player plus more. Best thing is you can find them now for $399 and that
price may go down even further. Now all you need is a plug in cartridge
that has a floppy controller on it and you have a 68K computer. The floppy
controller could be built for less than my magical $100. It is not much
more involved than a controller for a CoCo.


Pause while the naysayers get up to speed...

Of course it's not quite that simple. While OSK or (CD-RTOS) is in ROM
there is still software work that would have to be done to make it plug
and play. It is trivial compared to some of the stuff you CoCo guys have
done over the years so I'm sure the talent exists. Who then is going to
do this work? Not me or anyone at Hazelwood... BUT...

I've talked to Mike Smith about this and he will consider making a
development plug in board for a CD-I player that would have floppy, SCSI,
a serial port (for a terminal) and a monitor ROM derived from the KiX ROM.
This would allow tinkering with the CD-I player from a terminal connected
to the serial port. Like the KiX the ROM would have code to boot from
floppy or SCSI hard disk once 'someone' made something to 'boot'. The
cost of this 'dev' board would depend on what you guys end up wanting on
it and how many are ordered. As a ballpark expect a price under $200 if
20 are ordered. Once a working system is developed we would design and
build the production board with whatever features were needed and offer
it for sale. Who or what group did the software would have to decide what
they wanted (if anything) for their efforts.

Once you can offer a 68K system for less than $500 you would have a better
chance to attract new users to our market and that would help everyone.

Why even some diehard CoCo users mught make the jump.

Pause again while the naysayers catch there breath...

The only thing we (Hazelwood and FHL) want from this is the production
and sale of the plug in boards for CD-I once software is working.

Let the discussion begin.

        Frank, how much is the System V going for? I never did hear how
   much that was going for. I think the current low end systems, like the
   MM/1 and your System IV<at the time, your system would be a better
   argument since it's available. Hopefully the MM/1 will be the same
   sometime soon> are pretty inexpensive. I guess it's not a bad idea for
   some people who like to build systems up themselves, like most Coco
   users do, but for some reason, I don't see a reason to start at
   something like a $100 system and keep on pouring money to build it,
   when I can just save up a thousand bucks or a little more to get a
   fairly complete system with the OS and Programming languages.
        Also, as new,faster machines are coming into the OSk market<like
   the System V>, I think it is important to keep those inexpensive low
   end systems on the market, since a good majority of the home users are
   Coco users, and many won't be willing to spend more than $1000 or
   $1500 at most for a new OS9 system. That is, at least untill more
   software is produced, and the availability of good solid,low cost,
   developement machines can only help the community. When the TC-70 was
   taken off the market I thought that was a mistake, but as long as one
   inexpensive 68000 machine is on the market, we should be in good
   shape.

        Also, this goes out to anyone who might know. Will there be a
   review in any of the magazines on any of the newer OSK machines, such
   as the System V,Kix-20,and Kix-30? I know the accelerator board for
   the MM/1 will be in Metamorphasis, how about the others?

 Please - it's Ed, not Frank :-).

 The base price of a SYSTEM V is $1995.  This includes a 68020 running at
 25 MHz, 4 megs of RAM, Professional OS-9 Version 2.4, SYSTEM V documentation,
 schematics, etc.  A 33 MHz option is available.  It is shipped fully tested,
 ready to run by the customer and has a 1 year warranty.

 For those who like to 'roll their own', Peripheral Technology has some
 refurbished K2 and K4 boards available at some very attractive prices.
 (K2 = 68000 at 8, 10 or 12 MHz with up to 1 Meg of RAM, K4 = 68000 at 16
 MHz with up to 4 Meg of RAM.)  They can be contacted at 404-973-2156.

 For the foreseeable future, the SYSTEM IV will remain in our product line.
 It is still selling quite well.

 I've had at least one discussion with Mark Griffith about doing a review
 of the SYSTEM V.  Also, Mark has offered to write a suite of test programs
 which would provide a 'figure of merit' of the various machines.  I'm not
 adverse to such independent testing - remember, the SYSTEM IV was the first
 machine reviewed by RAINBOW when they were considering covering OSK.  When
 Mark is ready, I'll certainly make a SYSTEM V available to him.  I showed
 the SYSTEM V in Chicago last May and Atlanta this past October.  Many people
 'played' with it and these showings did result in orders.  It was also shown
 in San Diego in September - there is a report of this in the database here
 by Stephen Carville (PAGAN).

Yep that would be something for the production unit. Would also allow plugging

Chris,

Hazelwood and FHL are both market driven. The TC70 was discountinued
because nobody wanted to buy it.

Just because a machine has a 68000/70 does not make it a bargain. The
TC70 SBC sold for $1100 with OSK. The KiX\20 with an MGA board and the
same OSK sells for... $1100+-.

The full breakdown is this.

 KiX\20     699.95 (includes 25Mhz '02, ProOSK with C and BASIC)
 Case Kit   249.95 (includes case/PS/floppy/cable kit)
 4 Meg SIMM 299.95 (May change due to the market)
 Total     1249.85

Add about 20 minutes of your time to assemble it and you have a full
working 32 bit OSK system with a 25Mhz 68020, Professional OS9 with C
AND >BASIC< and full Microware manuals, full schematics etc. The
lowest cost way to get into OSK at this time.

This system also has a full 32 bit expansion bus for the 32 bit MGA
video card which has been tested fastest of all OSK based GWindows
systems. The 32 bit MGA card WITH GWindows costs $599.95. It compares
very well to OS9000 based systems with 'local bus' video boards that
cost in the $300 area and GWindows for OS9000 that costs $275. The
MGA also has a keyboard port and serial mouse port which 'local bus'
video boards do not thus making the MGA very competive.

SCSI hard drives are now available for $120 and up meaning that you
can get a full 25Mhz 32 bit GWindows system for under $1970.

The TC70 had a 16 bit bus (which cost extra) and its video was limited
to what the VSC could produce. No one in their right mind would buy a
TC70 when for just about the same money you could get the KiX\20.

 Frank, While the machine is mine, my niece and nephew also use it. So,
we have a good sampleing of ALL available CD-i titles sitting in my living
room.
 My first comment is that Tandy had to be insane to drop CD-i in favor of
VIS. The only thing I can think of is that they KNEW they would never sell
a VIS unit, if a CD-i unit was within 1000 feet<g>. The VIS systems are
S-L-O-W! While the graphics available on the stock CD-i unit are not
full motion, they at least appear on the screen in less than a second.
 We have both Story Machine disks, both 'Tell me WHY' disks, Zelda, Link,
Battleship, Text Tiles, Ceasars Casino, Smithonian, Laser Lords, Escape
from Cyber city, plus several others.
 In all cases the interface is easy to use, reasonably intuative, and
SMOOTH. There are some wargaming titles comming out in the next several
months - a sub simulator, axis & allies, The Battle of Bull Run...
 All I can say is that I expect to get alot more use out of this system,
even it it never developes a harddrive or keyboard.

Bill,

Good idea so here goes.

First some general comments. All current systems use some common parts.
PC cases, power supplies, keyboards, mice, floppy and hard drives.
These are more or less commodities that anyone can get very easily. We
and Hazelwood decided to concentrate on the guts of the systems rather
than complete systems. To do this we had to make the systems very very
easy to build. In most cases the assembly time is 20 minutes. It
consists of installing the motherboard and drives in the case and
connecting the cables. This saves you loads of money as I'm sure you
can tell by comparing prices.

You can buy the guts of any of the currently available systems from
their manufactures. Peripheral Technology has the PT68K, Computer
Design Services has the CDX68X20 and FHL/Hazelwood has the KiX
series, the KiX\20 and KiX\30.


RAM: A basic OSK starting system would need at least 1 Meg of RAM
with 2 or 4 better. The KiX systems can use 4 256K SIMMs (for
1 Meg) or 4 of any other size. The KiX's are 32 bits which is why
you need 4. 9 Bit SIMMs also work although the 9th bit is ignored.
256K SIMMs can often be found as 'pulls' or ones that were taken
out of a computer to upgrade it. I've seen 256K SIMMs pulls for $3.

HARD DRIVE: A 40 meg SCSI hard drive would also suffice. If you
already had a SCSI hard drive on your coco you could plug that
into your KiX without  having to reformat it. I've seen 40 Meg
Quantums for $119.

FLOPPY DRIVE: For a floppy get a 3.5" 720K/1.4Meg to be current.
Our system supports 5" drives of all types but we are trying to
standardize on 3.5" for the future. $50 or so should get you one.

CASE: All of the above systems are designed to fit into standard
PC cases. The KiX's support from 4 (KiX\20) to 8 (KiX\30) plug
in cards that are full height. This means that the low profile
PC cases would not work if you wanted to make use of any of the
expansion slots. Plenty of choices from $50 on up. Make sure
the power supply is included at this price.

CABLES: The KiX systems use ribbon cable assembles exclusively.
These are easy to make with components that are common. We also
offer a cable kit of all needed internal cables for those who
want to use their own case. $89 for the KiX\30 and $99 for the
KiX\20. (The KiX\20 has 2 more serial ports than the KiX\30 4
vs 2). External cables are all standard PC serial and parallel
types which are also easy to get.

We offer a kit that has a mini tower case, floppy drive
720K/1.4Meg and all cables for $249.95.

Basically once you've decided on whose 'guts' you want all you
need is the above.

GUTS: I don't have all the details of systems other than my own
so I'll concentrate on the KiX's. I think the KiX\20 is the best
buy of all the systems available. It is a 25 Mhz 68020 with 4
serial, 1 parallel port, Battery backed clock, 8K battery backed
Static RAM, SCSI interface, floppy controller, 4 expansion slots
(One of then is 32 bit) and full documentation including
schematics. Plus it will autoboot from floppy or hard drive.
It  also allows 1,2,4,8 or 16 Meg of SIMMs. What really makes
the KiX\20 the best deal is that it comes with Professional
OS9/68000 and C. Plus we also include BASIC which is extra cost
on other systems (usually $200) The KiX\20 sells for $699.95
with all this and at that price it is $200 LESS than our closest
competitor who doesn't include BASIC!

The KiX\30's have just gone thru a series of price reductions.
The 33Mhz KiX\30 is now $1799.95 which is $700 less than its
previous price of $2499.95. The 16Mhz KiX\30 is only $200 less
and for that reason everybody is buying the 33Mhz version. In
addition to what the KiX\20 has the KiX\30 has a 68030, full
DMA, FPU support, 8 slots with 4 being 32 bit. It is more on
the lines of a hi-end server while the KiX\20 is more for the
individual user.

Either of these systems can be used as 'console' systems. That
means you connect a terminal (coco can be used as a terminal)
to one of the serial ports and use it much as you are using
Delphi now. For a full featured GUI we have the MGA card for
either system.

VIDEO: Both KiXs can use the 32 bit MGA video card. We sell this
with GWindows for $599.95. The KiX\30 can use 4 of these where
the KiX\20 can only use 1. For the KiX\30 only the first
one has to have GWindows so additional MGA cards would only
cost $400 each. The MGA is a VGA like card and we
recommend a .28 or smaller dot pitch monitor. All monitors
tested so far work except those from Tandy. Each MGA has a
serial mouse connector and a PS2 style AT keyboard connector.
The 32 bit MGA card has 8 bit (256) color with palette and is
the fastest GWindows platform for 68K.

I hope that this answered your questions. Please let me know
if you need clarification on any of this information.

The machine will be compatible with ANY "terminal" type software. To run MM/1
specific software would require a copy of K-Windows. A port to the PT68K boards
is in the works, should be available some time next year. G-Windows should run

Frank, the system I was talking about would be under $1000 COMPLETE with case
and all. Your Kix 20 is over $1200 and you still need a monitor, keyboard, and
card for the two. I don't care much for a terminal system, but you could get it
for around the $100
0 if you use a terminal. I mentioned under $1000 because I KNOW for SURE I can
get the components under that price. I'm looking more at a couople hundered
under $1000, around $8000, and NOT a terminal system, but freestanding computer
even at that price. W
on't have the power of a KiX, just a development/beginner box. DARN!!! That
"$8000" should be "$800" !!!!!

Okay, I only know about the VIS idiot-box. I guess the marketing types at RS
saw more profit potential in the cheaper VIS box, especially since only minor
mods had to be made to existing PC CD-ROM software titles. Think about it a
minute. Your software is
practically developed already, and the technology is existing and cheap. A few
minor mods to your existing PC motherboards, a new case, a new BIOS, and you
have a "CD-I" machine! In the true sense of the term, I guess it WAS a "CD-I"
machine (is?), but not
 what we think of... us OS-9 aware types anyway!
From a pure marketing standpoint, it sounds great! Now, if they had used a
486SX in it, it just MIGHT have had a better chance!

rather pay the xtra $$ for a real CD-I machine that looks good, rather than

Are you sure you are not mixing up the VIS machines with the Memorex machine?
My disks say Philips Interactive Media of America on the front and has a

 Frank.. the Memorex machines that the shack sold ARE CD-i machines.
 I played with one BEFORE the Shack store had a VIS system to sell.

 On the front of the machine, below the Memorex name in real tiny letters
 was `A Philips Product'...

 Want to have some fun,.. get one of the shack people to place a mid to
 large size speaker on each side of the VIS machine so you can `hear'
 the nice stereo sound.  Turn up the vol. just a little.. now TRY to use
 the remote (he he).  It won't work at all reliable.  This is due to
 LACK of shielding in the VIS machine!!!  The tiny reed switches get
 `stuck' when in a magnetic field.

 Also, I found out that the VIS is using a `286' in it.  That and
 windows make it a `bargain' <g>.

 A side note:  I just found out that `Block Buster Video' is tied in with
 Philips for the `move' end.  The Sears store in my area also had 15
 movie titles available NOW.  Will have the `full motion' card mid
 December I'm told.

 Can't wait for that to hit the store <g>.

Frank, could you tell us what software is already in a user CD-i box (not a
developers system) such that we might get an idea of how much would need
written. Is it just a case of adding "dir" and "procs" and such, or is it
(as I fear) a case of adding RBF, SCF, drivers, descriptors, usable shell,
and *all* other utilities?
 If what you plan is really feasible, I'd probably go out and pick up a
CD-i just to tinker with. Guess I'll also have to get a television to hook
it to, too.
 But, until it is proven feasible, I think it best not to get the CoCo
community's hopes up to high. WE don't need another Rocket letdown right now.

     "Now all you need is a plug in cartridge that has a floppy
      controller on it and you have a 68K computer."

Wouldn't you also need a keyboard port or at least an RS-232 port to
attach a terminal to? I imagine running OSK apps with the CD-I
controller could get a bit difficult! <grin>

     "Once you can offer a 68K system for less than $500 you would

If you are counting on the person already having a terminal (or another
computer), a floppy drive, and a CD-I machine, isn't that restricting
the market just a bit?

After all, even at $100 for an interface, no cost for a terminal
(admittedly, *most* people interested in the product would likely have
another computer), add $399 for a CD-I player and a bit more for a
floppy drive, and you are a bit over $500.

Still, I think the idea has merit.

Of course, so would a good, relatively inexpensive OSK port for the
Amiga 1200 (possibly with new ROMs for booting OSK).

VIS is indeed not CD-I, but back when Tandy did sell CD-I machines, those
CD-I players had the Memorex label.

I am pretty sure that RBF and SCF are in ROM, drivers for the screen should
be there, and drivers for the CD drive have to be there too, I am faily sure
that SCF is on memory, I read of OS-9 Midi, it the Midi driver is used under
SCF, and OS-9 Midi is usable under CD-RTOS, the screen driver is probably
under SCF too, but I bet a special driver would be needed because I doubt
Philips has an ASCII char. set in the hardware. Maybe they do, I dunno.
Obviously, drivers for the SCSI drives and floppies would be needed, as well
as for the serial port. I would think that Microware would have had RBF
included with CD-RTOS, I mean, a CD would be a random access device...
I would like to see how all that is done, I mean, I wonder if this system
would allow, say a "dir /cd" with of course "/cd" being the cd-rom drive
Microware DOES offer a util. set for use with a cd-i machine that has a
floppy drive (apparently high-end systems do) as far as I know, this util set
is exactly that, shell and all the cmds. so maybe the screen I/O drivers
for plain ascii text would already be there.

If all this materializes, I would like to see aport of gwindows or something
I mean, it would be nice to play a cd-i game in one "window" or screen and
be on here chatting with you guys...hehehe, actually, if I wanted to do all
that, and play the game "well" maybe I would have to port OS-9 to my brain

Actually, Mike, I do know that CD-RTOS does not use RBF to access the disk
(CD). Think about it. RBF only knows about the standard OS9 disk architecture.
The CD-Rom is in an ISO standard. From scanning my OSK (2.4) defs files and
such, I have gathered that the manager used is named CDFM, and is very
different from RBF. So, the question is... did the makers have the forsight
to waste a bit of ROM space for the unused RBF in the interests of future
expansion? Personally, having never seen the insides of one of these machines,
I think we'll find *only* the stuff needed to make the CD-i run. I do not
expect to find RBF, any more than I would expect to find it in a traffic
light controller.

  But as I said to Frank, if the partys involved had the foresight to include
enough to make a basic, usable personal computer in every box, then I'm
all ears. Go for it.

hmmm, that is interesting..I guess the real question know is if the makers
of the other "high end" CD-I machines (not all of them are made by philips)
use Philips ROM chips, or if all CD-I roms are the same, if they are all the
same, then RBF and SCF definatly do have to be in there, since high end
CD-I machines include floppy support (and even a future home version of CD-I
is supposed to include a singe 3.5 floppy) Hopefully philips holds some sort
of rights somehow to the cd-i roms, or at least made it a standard that all
cd-i machines include the same modules..hopefully Frank will make the system
have 2 serial ports (one for a terminal, the other for a modem), or make
a "console" option for the future, for gfx stuff and an "ibm" type keyboard

Well, I'd say your priceing for the "standard" components are rather on the
high side, here's my list list of prices for standard components that
probably isn't even as low as it could be is stuff was bought in quantity.

MONOchrome Monitor             < $100 (bare bones intro/developement system)
Keyboard                         $ 30
Mouse                            $ 10
PC case w/150 watt PS            $ 60
floppy (1.44 meg 3.5")           $ 50
hard drive (80 meg 5.25" HH)   < $150

Thats $400... I just save you $300. (You can mail me the left over 8-) and I
didn't even TRY... A PTK2 board can be had for less then 150$ I believe. Not
sure what size/type memory they take. But lets say memory cost another $100 for
2 meg... Thats give you a complete system for $550... with OS-9... Not to
shabby.... I'm sure that is Frank does decide to package a low cost system up,
he can beat the prices I stated above.

 We are talking the mass (home) market machine here. Yes, there are CD-i
systems with full terminal and disk support. That's why I made the distintion
between home and developer machine. I did price a developers machine a few
years ago. For the money they wanted, you could buy a MM/1, KiX/30, System V,
*and* a used car. To be fair, the machine included all kinds of CD-i
development aids and libraries and such. Still, definately not a home machine.

 Hmmm, you talk like it's a done deal. This is what I'm trying to avoid until
some more facts are in. Is this idea workable?? Dunno. And, really, I don't
think Frank knows for sure, either. Go back and reread Frank's original
message. I have several times now. It appears to me that Frankis saying that
he's looking into making a limited board for a few brave souls to go exploring
with. If this exploration pans out, and the people are able to reverse
engineer the missing OSK parts, then he will do a production run of ????

 So, back to the original question. What is in the runtime CD-RTOS rom? How
valid of an idea is this??

Mike, one other thing that I gleaned from reading the defs files. Just hit
me that it applies here:

  OS-9 (6809) was designed so that only the kernel and BOOT (coco also needs
REL) have to be in ROM. When the kernel is initializing, if it can't find
things needed, like INIT, it calls F$Boot. This call executes the boot
module to load the (rest of the) bootfile from some other media. OSK does
not work this way. It expects everything needed to be loaded into ram at once.
Doesn't matter if it's coming from disk or out of ROM.
 However, CDFM has the capabilities of doing a F$Boot call, just like 6809.
This makes it so that only the kernel, CDFM, and whatever screen drivers, are
in ROM, even on a developers machine. It would allow them to put things like
disk drivers, RBF, serial and printer stuff, etc. into a boot file on a CD.
Ah yes. Shades of our favorite machine. You end up with this game machine,
with all kinds of weird add-ons and external drives. Stick in this special
disk, type in the magic command, and BOOM: inistant OS9 box. :>

 Note that this is purely hypothetical. The only evidence supporting it is
the existance of a F$Boot capability in CDFM. And it makes sense financially.

I don't have the full details at this point. I do know of a company that
has successfully connected a SCSI card to the CD-I player so I know the
concept is sound. I was hoping some of the CD-I 'lurkers' would respond
with those details. However let me make this statement. It ain't going
to be a simple job. It WILL require effort and knowledge to get this done.
The potential market 'may' be very large but the gamble is too high for
any one sane company to tackle. That is why I suggested the dev board.
It would provide the basic hardware for those who were interested in
tackling this. NO guarantees from me on the outcome. The production board
is NOT a product I plan on doing until and unless the software is done for
it. Now then if I win the lottery things may be different. <g>

 > I think it best not to get the CoCo community's hopes up to high.

I was really sorry that the coco community did not support the Rocket
project when it mattered. Chris Burke evendently put a lot of work in
it to no avail. There was not enough coco guys who placed an
order to make the project go. Less than 40 last I heard. Now if several
hundred had placed orders for it I think you would be looking at one
now. If the coco community does not support efforts from vendors then
there will be no vendors. I can say that because I am no longer a coco
vendor. We dropped support for it last year due to lack of interest. If
you want something for your coco you better buy it quick. This CD-I thing
is for the low end OSK community which may, by accident, be of interest
to the coco community.

There is a keyboard port on the back of the CD-I player. It is apparently
a serial port because you can also connect a modem to it. I don't have
any more info on it than that. As far as what the 'production' board
would have, a serial port would be easy. Remember that everything you
add increases the list by about 4 times the cost of the part. Think
of the coco disk controllers. Many were sold in all different
configurations. So using that as a guide you can imagine the number
of options you could have. They just cost money. Or as one of the
contractors said when I asked if he could do a difficult job...

"Sure, anything can be done if you sprinkle enough money on it."

Anything you do, from adding more features and increasing the cost
to leaving off features to reduce the cost will restrict the market.
The process is to start with something and when enough potential
customers say, "If that thing was purple I would buy it." Then you
make a purple version of the thing.

You have to start somewhere.

If that was a good idea then it would be a product today. The two
ports of OSK to foreign platforms (Atari ST and Mac) have not met
with the success necessary to make anyone invest the time and money
to do a port for the Amiga.

The REAL reason CD-I is so attractive is that OSK (or most of it) is
in ROM on the player. That makes a huge difference when the cost of
OSK is fully 1/3 of the cost of the under $1000 machines available
today.

Yeah, Mike, the potential for running OSK on a CD-i box is there. It wouldn't
take all that much for one of the CD-i makers to build a machine with all
the necessary stuff, for a price. But I really don't think we, the coco

There may be a wider range of interest in a CD-I interface than you think.  A
CD-I makes a IBM style rom drive look a little shabby.  Have you seen the cost
of Developement systems for CD-I?  With an interface and a tape driver you
might be able to eventually back into a developement system.  I would be in-
terested in such an interface not as a cheap OSK machine, since I have one
already,  but as an extension of the possibilities of OSK

     You are even on the high side for some of those components!  If you shop
around you can find Keyboards for $15, 80MEG Hard Drives for $80-90 (REFURBs)
Cases and Power Supplies for $30-45, CGA COLOR monitors for $100-125, CGA cards

IF you were putting the machine together piece by piece with no discounting
what-so-ever, your math would be correct. I have a source for NEW, UNUSED, 8088
and 80286 machines that will guarantee the components even AFTER I remove the
original motherboards.
 They want to dump.. er. .. "clear some warehouse space" to use some Tandy
words... so I can get a better deal on the components.

This machine will IN NO WAY be a "competitor" for the faster, more capable KiX
and System IV/V machines from FHL and Delmar, respectively. The systems I'm
proposing simply don't have the power of the more expensive systems. They will
either have monochrome
 or CGA monitors, though I am working to get a mono VGA at just slightly over
the CGA price. I will support these systems, and they are upgradeable by
replacing the motherboard, but that is strictly a user option. The bottom line:
If you are pretty sure yo
u want to stay with OSK, buy one of the faster machines if you have the money.
If you simply DON'T HAVE THE CASH, or ARE NOT SURE YOU WANT TO STAY WITH
OS-9/68K, then you may want to purchase one of these stop-gap, budget systems
instead. And these CAN be
upgraded in a year or so at an acceptable price ($300 or less for a new 16 bit,
faster motherboard), considering the initial cost. Now realize that the $300
upgrade is a MAXIMUM figure, and an educated emaximum ESTIMATE. They will most
likely be cheaper to
 upgrade in a couple years. But then upgrading will require a new motherboard,
which could just as well be a KiX! Oh yes, the systems will have a 720K drive
instead of a 360K... required, actually, for the OSK operating system.

Well, you are correct in stating that there are SOME used systems available.
The system I'm considering IS upgradeable... with a motherboard cahnge.hange...
but at a reasonable price. And the upgrade could just as well be a KiX board as
anything else. I do
n't think this would be competing with your low end systems. I have made it
clear in other messages that if you have the finances then you should consider
a KiX or System IV/V. But there are some who would like something cheaper to
play with NOW, so they w
ill know for sure if they want to upgrade to a faster, more expensive system.
There won't be any faster systems from me as complete units, at least I'm not
expecting to do that AT ALL. I'd have to sell a LOT of these to even consider
such a thing, and don'
t expect to sell over a dozen. This isn't a big money maker for me either.. it
is mainly a magazine article series showing how to setup and put together an
OSK system. Many of the techniques will apply to the KiX as well.

I have decided two things, though... the monitors will be monochrome in order
to cheaply increase resolution. I may be able to get VGA mono (B&W) monitors
for only a small price penalty, and will go that way if possible. A 720K drive
will be the smallest a
lso, necessitated by OSK!

Even with these additions, the cost of a fully assembled, ready to go system
won't exd $1000, S&H included. And a component kit will be less. I mentioned
$1000 because I can deliver at that price REGARDLESS of waht comes up... I
could almost buy items piec
e by piece and still achieve that figure.

Frank, the port of OS-9 to ANYTHING isn't making a lot of inroads. If you
didn't have to pay the high royalties to microware, your systems could be
cheaper. I was told that microware wanted to start having UltraC, a near $1200
product, bundled with all sys
tems now. I know they aren't forcing you guys to do that now, but will they? In
other words, I don't think microware is interested in a mass market product,
they have a profitable niche as is. The ports to other platforms are high,
considering they already
 have a good multi-tasking (if not user) OS with them. OS-9 doesn't hold
anything over System 7, and not much over the ST DOS either!

Well, there's chip supply problems, then there's chip SUPPLY problems. The
first chip chosen, the most capable of all options considered, turned out
to be very difficult to get from  any supplier. After much waiting, and then
many many phone calls, we found the cause of the supply delays. It never
went into production!!
 The options being studied now use a much slower chip. But before everyone
gets in an uproar, this is not a bad thing at all. Rather than being eight
times faster than the coco can possibly handle, it will only be four times
faster.  :>

            "You 'could' use a TV set to start with."

Ick! For an OSK machine!?! <grin>

     "If that was a good idea then it would be a product today."
      (Referring to an OSK port to the Amiga).

If one were to use that logic, there would have been no use in you
asking about the possibility of a board to use a CD-I machine as an
OSK computer, as it would have been a product already if the idea was
good. Not all good ideas become products, and as Tandy's VIS proves,
not all products are good ideas. <grin>

The failure of the OSK ports to the ST and Mac does not in itself
indicate the concept is bad. It could just as easily indicate poor
product and marketing on the part of the company developing and
selling the product.

With the A1200 selling for under $400 mailorder, having a floppy
drive, parallel and serial ports, built-in hard drive (IDE) support,
a 14.32Mhz 68020, and 2 megs memory expandable to 10, and readily
available accelerators, and standard graphics supporting not only
NTSC graphics, but also 640x480 output at VGA scan rates with
256 colors out of a 24-bit pallete, I suggest it makes for a
better 'personal' OSK machine, provided a *decent* OSK port could
be made available for $200-$300. Given the price the MM/1 and TC-70
sold for with OSK included, unless the hardware was a mere fraction of
the selling price, this does not seem unreasonable.

However, I do agree almost any port of OSK to a non-OSK 'native'
machine will likely fail. Why? Because those purchasing the machine
will likely be lured into using software for the machine's native OS,
which, at least for personal use, is more readily available even for
the Atari ST than for OSK, and of course, would be more likely to
take advantage of any special hardware.

Correct me if I am wrong, but one problem with ports of OSK to other
machines is one a CD-I machine converted to an OSK computer would face:
The "personal" market for OSK is limited.

As far as someone making a lot of money or staking a business on the CoCo, I
have to agree with you. My bit is hobby only, and I make money becasue I am
supporting OSK AND the CoCo. At this point, many of my readers are interested a
lot in OS-9 and OSK, bu

so that when it looks like there is a reason for them to get a new machine,

Not true. The reason using CD-I now 'may' be a good idea is that the
price has dropped from $800 to $400. THAT makes it different.

 > better 'personal' OSK machine, provided a *decent* OSK port could

The main reason that it would cost more is not the cost of the licensee
but the cost of doing a port to hardware that was not meant to run it.
In the case of the KiX the hardware was designed with OSK in mind. The
software people had all the information needed to do the port and the
cost could be better justified as part of the hardware. Also in the case
of the KiX most of the drivers are derived from previous ports. As a
matter of fact Hazelwood makes it a point to use the same parts from one
platform to the next to reduce the cost of making a port to each new
machine.

You can buy various ROMless Mac logic boards from $200 up. I think 020
boards go for $300. However the cost of doing the port would be high.

I know that doing the port for the Mac was very difficult. The only way
they can recover that cost is to sell the OS. Also when ever a new Mac
comes they are forced to support it.

 > The "personal" market for OSK is limited.

The market for OSK now is much like the market for 6809 was back before
the CoCo. The questions to ponder and ask yourself are these.

 Could the CD-I player become the next coco?

 Will the introduction of a board to turn it into a computer sell?

 How many of the assumed 100,000 will buy it?

 If even a small percentage buy it how will that effect the current
OSK market?

 Is this a great opportunity or just a pipe dream?

ponder ponder on

Uh, I should have said it  hasn't gone into mass production yet, and they
are no longer forecasting a release date. But call it what you want.

As I said to Mike, I really want to have plastic in hand before committing
too far. We're  looking at various renditions of the 16552. None of them
are totally compatable with the 553 (*lots*lower max ratings, for one), but
will with minor board and software changes. Do note that while these chips
are slower than the 553, their still a lot more than the coco needs.

        In that case it wasn't such a bad idea, but I think to be a
   little more fair, the KIX-20 price should also include the MGA Card
   with Gwindows<adding about $600.00>. Still not a bad price, but I
   think it is a more realistic comparison since, without the MGA, users
   cannot hookup a keyboard and are restricted to using it as a
   terminal<Coco if it is being sold to a Coco user> based system. I
   don't think it should be considered a COMPLETE system untill you at
   least have keyboard and mouse capability, if not also a keyboard and
   mouse with it, since basically any system sold nowadays includes that
   support. Maybe another idea would be to include keyboard support
   through another graphics card similar to MGA, but not as robust, which
   would come with the computer, and then allow them to purchase MGA
   later<as you do now>. I think the $1970 you list at the end of your

Chris,

Re KiX\20 pricing without the MGA added.
More than 90% of sales to date of the KiX\20 are without the MGA
card. Most OSK users are terminal users. We are always considering
making changes and additions to the KiX line depending on demand
from users and potential users. A low cost video card has come up
several times. Two things to remember in the KiX systems are:
1... All KiX video cards (MGA) are 32 bit and have to have mouse
and keyboard support which adds to the cost. 2... Most of our
customers tend to opt for the faster (more expensive) options.
With that in mind a lower cost video card would only be $100 or
so lower. Unless we could offer some other reason to buy it I think
most would opt to spend the extra cash in trade for the speed of
the MGA. We are looking at this and trying to find a way to offer
more features AND keep the speed AND lower the cost. Maybe by the
end of 94. In the meantime the MGA is still the fastest 68K GWindows
video system available and that ain't bad.

We are now working on our new flyer and a major part of it will be
system pricing that will hopefully make it easier to put together
the package you want.

Well, I'm working on reducing the cost of OSK with another vendor. That is
a BIG chunk of the problem! Of course, the c compiler will be dropped, but
we have another idea on that. Eventually, a new linker and assembler will
be written for the GNU compiler, or another non-linking compiler has been
mentioned. I don7t know enough about C to know the difference between a

All the 16552 (or at least the four versions we currently know about) are
totally 550 compatable. They are all rated for up to 8mhz which nets a max
speed of 512K bps. They do not have the extended features of the 553, such as
a max rating of 24mhz (2M bps). From here on out all four chips differ some.
One (the first we looked at and dismissed) does not have the para port. Another
is currently "out of stock". The two remaining (#'s 3 and 4 on our discover
list) are not totally pin compatable. This means minor differences in board
design. So, we want a rock solid supply lined up (plastic in hand), as I'm
sure you can understand.

  To date, the only design goal, and spec as pertaining to the CoCo, to change
is the release date.

Frank, the only way to make the KiX 20 an ideal low cost system would be to
use some type of existing VGA chipset (there must be a VESA chipset that is
32 bit... or could you squeeze the 32 bits into a 16 bit set at an acceptable
speed????) and keyboard controller.... possibly built directly onto the
motherboard instead of a card. If a card could be kept n close to $250 (less
than half theMGA price), it SHOULD find some support as long as it is as fast
as IBM VGA.

The MGA at least sounds fantastic, but you pay for that performance!

"Linking" is the process of "resolving" references to objects used but
not defined in a piece or pieces of code so that you wind up with something
that can actually be run.  This can happen long before the code is run
(the usual case with programming languages that have a batch-oriented
origin), done by a separate "linker" program, or it can happen as the
code is run (with unresolved references being noticed somehow and filled
in on the fly, sort of like BASIC09 or RunB looking in the module
directory for invoked procedures, though not necessarily that way--to
see how it can be done, look at old papers on the "Multics" operating
system).

Another approach to compiling is to just not allow unresolved references,
so that the compiler presumes that all references are either to language
built-in routines or things defined in the source code.  This is done
in some interactive systems and in some "student" or "debugging" oriented
batch systems, like the old WATFOR and WATFIV FORTRAN compilers.

Non-linking compilers have compilation speed on their side, since they
don't have to go traipsing through libraries or have a separate linker
pass--they just write the executable out directly, some even bypassing
an assembly language stage.  OTOH, it's hard to reuse code with them...
though on the third hand, a really fast "non-linking" compiler could
allow for sharing at the source level, and if it's fast enough, perhaps
nobody would notice the difference.

 Frank,

 Most all the new vga chipsets support 32, 16 and 8 bit buses.  The VESA
 specification is for a 32 bit bus.  While the chipsets support all the
 buses, the cards do not.  Most card mfgs are providing cards for VESA and
 16-bit ISA buses (these are separate cards).  A few are supporting the
 EISA bus.  In one sense, the VESA specification came too late.  Most of
 the new chip sets include a graphics accelerator.  The instructions for these
 functions are byte oriented.  The registers which control performing the
 various gfx functions are a single byte in size.  Depending on the function
 you wish to do, you merely set the appropriate registers and the gfx chip
 does the rest.  This has an added advantage in that the main processor is
 free to do other, unrelated work.  The improvement in gfx speed is quite
 substantial.  I'm seeing performance improvements of 3 to 5 times over our
 existing 'dumb' card.

 > If a card could be kept n close to $250 (less than half theMGA price), ..

 The good news is that these cards are available in the price range you want.
 As the competitive pressure builds up, you can expect the prices to drop.
 At least one mfg is looking at modifying his card to work in 8-bit ISA
 slots, too.  This would allow its use in the SYSTEM IV.

 Above a certain threshold and depending on the application, gfx speed isn't
 necessarily the final criterea.  The SYSTEM V is competing with several
 other systems from other mfgs to be the hardware platform for a Company
 in the industrial market.  Their product is based on G-WINDOWS and
 ControlCalc.  They are more than satisifed with the gfx performance we are
 offering.  But, it requires that the processor do the work slowing down
 other activities.  The competing hardware (and the one being used on an
 interim basis) use the newer chipsets.  At least one is using the TIGA gfx
 graphics co-processor (but it is very expensive).  All of these relieve the
 microproccessor of much of the gfx processing.  I was informed all have
 G-WINDOWS performance of at least 2 to 3 times what we're getting with the
 dumb gfx card - also told me I didn't want to know how much faster the system
 with the TIGA gfx graphics co-processor is <g>.  BTW, they have not selected
 the TIGA system as their interim system.  I was assured that the SYSTEM V
 stands a good chance of becoming their standard hardware platform when I
 finish the G-WINDOWS port to the new vga card.  Their decision is based on
 performance based on their testing, quality and price.

 > The MGA at least sounds fantastic, but you pay for that performance!

 According to the information provided by this customer, the KIX30/MGA is _not_
 the fastest machine running G-WINDOWS on OSK platforms.

write() wants a *pointer* as its second parameter.  Since the first
call works fine, buffer must be either an array, which in this context
is turned into a pointer to its first element, or a pointer, which
is fine as it is.  Therefore, buffer[i] is a value of whatever type
buffer points at.  For example, if buffer has type pointer to character
or is an array of characters, buffer[i] could be, say, the character
'A', which in ASCII has some value <switch to another window>, yeah,
that's the ticket, 0x41, i.e. 65.  What write() did was write out
whatever stuff was at that (low) address in memory.

So that's why that happens.  If you really wanted to go for maximal
function call and system call overhead :-), then do

 write(Screen, &buffer[i], 1);

which gives write the pointer it wants.

     Pyramid Solitaire Demo
     From: COLORSYSTEMS To: ALL

Now in the library is a demo version of my program Pyramid Solitaire for
the MM/1.

This program runs and draws the main board, and will even play a game
with itself, but the main game playing logic is disabled.

If you like Pyramid Solitaire and would like more information on it
and the other four Variations of Solitaire which comes with it, send
email to COLORSYSTEMS.

I really like your demo.  I have a question, though.  On my system,
while the demo was auto-playing, I switched screens and the pointer came
on the new screen and trashed the window... so I switched to another,
and same thing.  :)  Obviously, a K-Win bug.  I was wondering if anyone
else had this problem, and perhaps you might want to find out which
operation is causing this and post it here so the "new K-Win program,
whom shall remain nameless" might be able to squash the bug.  :)

I quickly noticed this problem, as during testing of the autoplay mode, I
wanted to let it play for awhile to "burn it in". So I was going to switch
to another window and do some text editting, and that's when I saw it. Mouse
cursors all over the place!! I had the occasion to speak with Kevin Pease
that same day on an unrelated issue and brought up the problem. Kevin
told me it sounded like a KWindows bug which has been around since day
one. (Even #51 does not fix the problem) I have sent a copy of the program
to the person Kevin told me to send it to along with an explanation of
the problem. I have yet to hear back on any solution or whatever. Will
keep the Forum posted.

Okay, Phil. Looks like a difference is dmode commands. Yours has a few scsi
specific items in it. S, is this a MFM drive on a B&B, or a "N" series on
something else? Might make a difference. Anyway:

 Cyl   =  Cyl  = $267   (615)
 Hds   =  Sid  = 04
 step  =  Stp  = 06  (B&Bspecific)
 sectrk=  sct  = $22  (34)
 alloc =  ???  (may be typ at $80)
 ilv   =  ilv  = depends on your system and cpu type
 initcmd and inittbl are both SCSI specific.

Ah, so you have an adapter board to convert the st506/412 (MFM) drive to

change the cyl, heads (sides), and the drive number to match the Seagate.

Hi, Phil -

Could we step back a little;  I went back as far as I could in this thread,
but wasn't able to find a description of your original problem.

Are you trying to add a second (i.e. ST225) drive to your Disto SASI
system, in addition to your Rodime?  What all have you done?  Which
version of CCHDisk are you using (original, or the patched version
using cchdsasi.ar?  What do your descriptors (both of them) look like?
What are the drive-select strappings set for on the ST225?  Do you have
a straight-through 34-pin cable, or does it have the IBMoid twist in it?
(You don't want the twist.)

Hopefully, with enough info, we will be able to help out.

Cheers... / Ken

Hi Ken--I want to determine if this st225 is operable. I wasn't planning

height. The cchdisk I'm using came from an archive that had three st225
descriptors in it. I installed the driver but didn't use the descriptors

That archive was probably my cchdsasi patch file.  The descriptors should
be correct for your drive, when used with the WD-1002-SHD or WD-1002-TAN
(if I remember correctly) SASI interfaces.

Good luck.

Phil,
     You have an MFM drive and you can use it just fine on the SASI board you
have hooked to that RODIME.  Make sure you set the jumpers on the Seagate so it
is Drive 1 as opposed to drive 0.  Use the stock descriptor from the Disto disk
since it is set up for a Seagate ST225.  Everything should work just fine.

Phil, one thought: if all of the cables are known to be good, then it
might be worth looking at the 12V power supply.  It may not be able to
drive the stepper.

Hi again, Phil -

Hmmm... that might it.  It is not uncommon for a switching
supply to require more of a load than a single hard drive, in order
for the supply to come up to full power.  For example, another local user
found he needed to connect at least one floppy in addition to his ST238
to make his power supply work.  Others have attached load resistors to
accomplish the same purpose, but I would prefer to see the heat serving
a useful purpose <g>.

Try connecting another drive and see if this helps.

Cheers... / Ken

  A common cause for that error is that you want to make sure that you don't
have an extra carriage return at the end of the .ctl  files.
Meaning, make sure the file ends on the same line as the last entry.  Also, you
you create the log file, a good way to create that would be to
do a echo date >ribbs.log

Hope this helps

Phil, I saw you response to Bill (ISC) and you are correct.  One of the
problems with WIZ and/or WizPro was the need to make up a special boot

        Bill, I believe the main documentation is in it's own seperate
   archive<available here in the telecom database>. I tried setting up
   Wizpro previously, and it just wasn't worth the effort. Looked great,
   but I couldn't keep it up too long and never got it too work. I do
   remember having to download the main doc seperately.

Chris,

Thanks for the info about Wizpro.  I have been using Supercomm a lot and I
don't mind it, I just was curious about WizPro because the guy who wrote it
also wrote a book about OS9, and he brags a lot about WizPro in his book.
I may try it again later, but I now have another problem related to hardware.
I just bought 2 80 track diskette units and I can't get them to work as /d0.
I had the jumpers set for /d0, but they give I/O errors in DECB and will not
read OS9 diskettes as /d0.  They work OK as /d1.  Do you know what else I
have to do to configure them as /d0?  When I try them, they just continuously
seek when they are connected as /d0.  Thanks for the info again.

sounds like you need to reconfig the /d0 Discriptor.......
if those are 96tpi drives.....80 track double sided!
I ran into a weird problem with those drives! I got real confused....
I have a 80 track double sided on mine as /d2 and use a 80trk 3.5" as /D0
thinking I have a Quad drive<96tpi> I setup the Dmode as 96tpi and ran a test
,after doing that the drive would verify ok,and then crash as one tried to read
it later,on reading Dmode on would find the tpi BACK to 48tpi!<shee>
formating it at 48tpi worked fine!<strange>.....The dmode I have came with
the disto H/Drive board....and it allows one to change tpi....others do not!
at lest the ORG one don,t!    change the tracks and stuff on it and it should
sort out the problem!

     Annoying exit on EOF
     From: TELENUT      To: ALL


   Please help! I am wrighting several applications that, in order to be as
versitile as possible must be started and use input from a procedure file. I
have run into one very annoying problem. After the program (executed by a
procedure file) finishes tasks in the procedure file (the same one) reaching
the end of the procedure file, it exits with an EOF error #000:211.

   The procdure file looks like this:

launch
buttonone
yes
buttontwo
yes
buttonthree
yes
buttonfour
no
         (end of file)

      The util sets up four buttons this way and then waits for a button to be
pressed. When it reached the "no" it enters wait mode and then that annoying
EOF breaks the program and returns to the shell. I have tried changing shell
options to stop it from exiting on EOF but I haven't tried changing tmode
settings. Funny, seems I solved this problem before but I don't remember.

      The actual "launch" program is written in MW BASIC(09) on an MM/1. I am
using TSMON.

      BTW, I have thought about using option support but there are utils that
wouldn't be as flexable.


    Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

This is the output of mfree after completeing the 4 Meg Memory Hack on
an MM/1.  Notice the 8 Meg of free RAM! You too can have this.

There are two ways to get the hack.  Ask me and I'll send you the
details so you can do it yourself.  However, be cautioned that this is
not a pretty hack, nor is it easy to do.  You'll need to have a good
amount of experience in soldering, cutting traces, pulling pins up on
already soldered in chips, piggybacking chips, and running tiny wires
around on the board.  If you have never done something like this, I
wouldn't attempt it yourself.  You can do permanent and fatal damage to
the I/O board.

The other method is to let me do it for you.  For a $50 charge, I'll
perform the hack, test it, and make a new init module for you.  I'll
also guarantee my work for a year (the hack only).  All you need to do
is send me your I/O board.  If you want me to include the 4 Meg SIMMs,
let me know.  I haven't priced them lately, but I'm sure I can get some
at a reasonable price for you.  I should be able to do the hack and get
your board back within 2 weeks.

This would make a great Christman present to yourself.  If anyone is
interested, let me know via email.

HELP!

I'm trying to write a program using Mark Griffith's skel.c framework.

Actually, I had a working version using the Coco skel.c.

My current problem is with menus.  I have 3 menus defined.  If I click
on a menu, it drops down and I can select items from that menu with no
problem.  HOWEVER, if I decide to move the mouse off the menu, the
program goes and hangs in a portion of the program where I create
an overlay window.  I'm about to pull out my remaining hair on this
one.

I've stayed fairly faithful to Mark's original framework.  I'm open
to ideas, suggestions, experience, bug reports, etc.


Thanks in advance.

It sounds like something is getting stomped on when you pull down the
menu.  Happens to me whenever I go tinkering with my menus, too.  Just make
sure that element that defines the width in characters of the menu is
one greater than the actual length of the menu.  If you need some more
examples, I can E-Mail you some of mine.

Code fragments would really help.  There is no way to easily tell what

You can just put up the function or a part of the function that is
causing the problem.  Obviously, whatever is happening after you select
the menu item is the problem.  All we would need to see is that function.
No need to upload the entire program.

The point is, if you want people to help you with your efforts, you should
make it as easy as possible for them.

does anyone know of a bbs system for OS-9 level 2, that can run on 2 720k

just want an easy way to have a few friends of mine (5 of em) to be able
to send mail back and forth to each other and up/download files...I would
like to use StG, but if I download it on 1 drive, I cant un-ar it, as I
am sure it takes more than 360k..my 20meg HD is FILLED no more room,
practically..and I would like to just have my 720k and 360k drives for the
BBS, I am planning on hooking up a 2nd 720 in a few days or so..but am still
wondering about BBS software..btw, does ANY coco BBS system support multiable
terminal types? like ANSI,VT100,and WYSE 50?? actually, I just need support
for wyse and vt100...

You can set up a StG system on on 2 720K drived, no problem.. I think someone
even did it with 2 360k drives... Try extracting part of the files to the
second drive, and then, when that is full, extract the rest... A lot of the
stuff in the archive is example menus, help files, and extra programs that
you won't need if you just want a simple E-Mail system for your friends.
StG V3 supports ANSI, OS-9 Level 2, and Plain Text modes with its menuing
program... StG V4 (not available yet) supports all terminal types, through
Termcap.

Nope, I downloaded the .ar file for StG, I cant use it on the floppies...
inside the .ar file is a mess of .LZH files, all the cmds are in 1 .LZH
and take up about 500k ...so I cant get the lzh file out of the .ar to
unlzh..because the entire .ar is on a 720k disk, and I only have the 1 360k
floppy for space to unar..unless I clear off around 700k or so off my HD
but I really dont want to do that just to extract something..to bad the cmds
are bundled up like on the demo version of StG..in 2 parts..oh well..
I guess I will have to wait till I get another 720k drive..probably around
4 weeks..by the time it actually gets here (after I order 1)..

I guess I will have to take a look at AcBBS, or RIBBS..or just roll my own
until I can get StG to run..the MENU systems in the DB's would work for a
menu, and the OS-9 mail system would work nice for the mail..all I would
have to do is make a quick basic09 program to "chain" them all together
along with calls to sz/rz and bingo..my goal would be accomplised..of course
running StG would be MUCH nicer..oh well..actually, come to think of it
what exactly doesnt work with the demo release? is is the login command?
if so, could someone send me the corrected modules (email or on disk)
and I will just use the demo release..

archive WAS set up better, then a second Demo releasearchive was done, and
the archives were not done by me, so they wern't set up as nice 8-)

The only thing "missing" from the demo version is network registration.
It is fully functional as a non-networking bbs. When you pay the registration
fee, you submit a system node name for your system, and you get a get a network
"password" for your system.

Thanks! I just placed an order for a new 720k drive, I am still playing
with ideas on a new HD (If I want to get a bigger/add another MFM, or just
go SCSI), SCSI is looking nice though..so, I might go for it..

btw, we will have a new OS-9/6809 user soon, (about a month) a friend
has done what may be the ultimate upgrade (with th exception of buying a Cray)
he is moving from an Apple II, to a coco under OS-9. He saw my coco, and
decided to go for it, when he gets an HD set up, and gets a handle on OS-9
he wants to run a BBS (and of course I will recommend StG)...

So, between my set eventually going online as a BBS, and his, we should see
2 more CoCo BBS's soon, both running StG!!

Thanks Jim... A sugestion for the archives.. use lha 2.11b... and don't
do archives in archives... also... try to seperate the commands into
two archives. one containing the bare minimal commands to get a simple
system running with Mail, the oither containing all the nice little
extra programs, and the News utils... That way, if someone just
wants to get a E-Mail system up and running, then all they need to download
is the basic command archive... I don't know if you ever saw the way I
originally did the first Shareware arcvhie's, but it was pretty much done
this way... (I'll look to see if I can find the original archive, or at least
the makefile I used to create the archives)

Randy,
   According to my Seagate Installer's manual, the ST-225 is a MFM drive with
4 heads, 615 tracks and a step pulse of 5-200 microseconds.  You need to set
up the driver so it write precompensates tracks 300-614.  It DOES NOT have
an auto-park feature, so you should remember to park it before powerdown.
If you need to know anything else drop me some e-mail.

yes you can do that. I ran a ST238R as a 20 megger for years. The only
difference between the drive is the 238R was tested with the tighter format
(a ST238R is basically the same as a ST225, just cramming in more sectors
per track) Im using my Seagate ST238R as an example, but a real example.

I have done the opposite, ran into some problems down the road since a
MFM drive isn't tested to take an RLL format, its risky

     Using hdbackup
     From: LUCKYONE     To: MARKGRIFFITH


Hi,
for the first time I have decided to do a backup of my HD (I've heard it
is the thing to do.) and as I mentioned in my last message to you I
used MW's fsave and that didn't work. Today (11/21/93) I decided to use
hdbackup to get the job done. I enter the command line

  hdbackup -f -d /dd -o /f0

and everything seemed to be going well. I left my computer to do
something else and when I came back the computer was completely hung up.
After rebooting I did a listing of the backup.full.1 file in the log
directory. The listing was showing all of the files that had been backed up
when all of a sudden it started showing text from what looks like one
of the ix compuserve files. Any thoughts about this? Has anyone else
had this problem?

The last file saved was /dd/GAMES/SeaBattle and the next one is

Also the flopptical still had 53% space left on it. I checked /dd
with dcheck and the file structure is intact.

I hope this is enough info to give you an idea of the situation.

Thanks for any help you can give me.

I had this problem, too.  I think you have an old version of hdbackup.
I know the original version had a bug (memory allocation I believe) and
I think Mark reuploaded the program here so the Delphi version was
fixed, but not sure (Mark?).  I will email you the copy I have that

As Joel as mentioned, there is a version with a memory allocation bug.
I can't remember if I uploaded the corrected version to Delphi or not.
If not, I'll do that.  In the mean time, I can send you binary mail with
the correct one.  It'll be in you mail box tomorrow or the next day.

I have a problem you could relay to Gene about lha 2.11b, I will also

execution when I try to archive something.  Here is th output:

                                  ^ lha will STOP right here.
  The temporary file exists but it is not a "legal" lzh file.  ie. it seems
to lockup before it gets to the renameing portion of the program.
  The reason I am also going to tell Wes is that this only happens when
I'm booted up with NitrOS-9 v1.16.  LHA works fine with Nitro v1.15!

I think the problem may be narrowed down to the v1.16 of RBF30.
BTW I was the person who "did't" have a problem with LHA and v1.16. :-)
At the time I was using the Tandy RBF that was nitro'd.  As soon as I
put the v1.16 RBF30 in my boot I started to have the problem with LHA!
So what I have been doing is using a v1.15 boot with the Nitro's Tandy
RBF when I use LHA.  I have been talking to Wes in e-mail and he will take
a look at it too.

Wes,
  I am haveing problems with the lha archiver and Nitro v1.16.  I gave
details of the problem in message #83463.  Basically what is happening
is lha will lock up when executed under Nitro v1.16 but will work fine
with v1.15!  The differences between the 1.15 and 1.16 boot disks is:
CC3Go.nv116, CC3IO.nv116, RBF30.nv116.
  I'm pretty sure thats theonly differences between the 2 boots.
I don't have RBF30 in the v1.15 boot, I used the Tandy RBF when I 1st
got nitro and only recently patched rbf30 up to v1.16 nitro.  Let me know

     Budget OSK machine
     From: DSRTFOX      To: ALL

Okay, I got stepped on before!

I'm planning on putting together some under $1000 OSK systems. These will be
COMPLETE systems with monitor, case, keyboard, hard drive, etc. And I mean
UNDER $1000... for around $950 (S&H and all included) for an assembled unit,
less for a component kit (you put in motherboard, etc., but ALL peices
included.... the assembled unit just not assembled). These aren't meant to
compete with the FHL and Delmar systems. They are BUDGET systems for those
who can't afford the expense of the faster, better FHL and Delmar systems.
I'm NOT in competition with them! If you're not sure if you want to go to
OSK or not, consider one of these budget, upgradeable units. If you ARE sure
you want OSK, then you might be better off with a System IV or KiX20. You
would have nearly as much in one of these after an upgrade to a similar
System IV anyway.

There will be a build-up of these systems in "the world of 68' micros" at about
the same time they would actually ship... around mid March or April at the
earliest. If you might be interested in such a unit, reply to ME, please!

UNIT CONSISTS OF:
10MHz 68000
1MB RAM
Case (four drive bays)
CGA monitor
20MB hard drive (MFM)
Keyboard
Power Supply
360K drive

This is the PROPOSED system at the moment. I'm actually leaning more toward a
monochrome monitor, since it has the necessary resolution to run G-windows.
This system IS a bit slow for G-windows, but would be suitable for program
development at least if the capability of running, even slow, is there.
I'll stress that this is purely a beginner/budget machine ONLY. A faster
version will not likely be available, but upgrade instructions will be readily
available. Magazine articles would run on assembly, setup of OSK, and some
upgrades.
If there isn't enough interest, it won't happen. I need to have committments
for a minimum of 5-10 units to make this a cost effective venture for all
involved.

Actually, you probably are... you just have to redraw the window.  :)
K-Windows does not do that for you.

 > Also, does ReSizeWin() check to see if the window is smaller

I don't use a lot of the cgfx.l functions (write most of my own), so I
don't know what _ss_wset is, but I do know that ReSizeWin() doesn't do
any size checking.

 > If it doesn't, what should I do?

Use _gs_scsz() to determine the new screen size after resizing, and see
if the window is too small... if it is, you have to DWEnd and DWSet
again... or there are some other tricks of the trade.

Hugo,

You have to use the _gs_winfo() call, and take the pixel values and
divide them by 8 to get the char position values.  K-Windows only places
screen on char pos. boundaries, so these are guaranteed to have no
remainders.

 > 2. If I DWEnd, doesn't the screen disappear if that was the last

Ok, this is a 10,000 question.  The answer is there's a trick... You can
actually forget about sending a DWEnd() call to the window, and simply
send a new DWSet() call using window type $fe and all the usual
parameters you have got from the _gs_winfo() call to keep the window in
the same spot.  But, there's a problem, since there's an implied DWEnd()
in sending a new DWSet to an existing window.

Now, the reason why you dare not send the DWEnd() is, as you mentioned,
the screen vanishes and the new window will appear on another screen,
rather than the one the user was originally on.  The problem with not
sending it, is the system can die, or get messed up since when K-Windows
sees the DWSet call taking place on an existing window, it performs a
DWEnd, but neglects to keep the rest of the DWSet display string
preserved, so bad things happen.

A strange thing, though.  Although I proved that the correct display
codes were being sent (by redirecing program output to a disk file, then
DUMPing its contents), the problem existed, yet when I used the program
'display' to send the EXACT same sequence of codes to an existing
window, it worked!!  So, what is the difference?  'Display' sends the
bytes one at a time... a separate write() call for each byte.  DWSet()
cgfx.l library call sends all bytes at once, and when the implied
DWEnd() occurs, K-Windows forgets about the other bytes.  Soooooooooo...
just write your own routine to send out the bytes one at a time.
Here's what I use:

resize(xloc,yloc,xsiz,ysiz)
int xloc,yloc,xsiz,ysiz;
{
    int e;
    char temp_buff[13];

    temp_buff[0]=0x1b;
    temp_buff[1]=0x20;  /* DWSet */
    temp_buff[2]=0xfe;  /* Screen type $fe */
    temp_buff[3]=(char)xloc;
    temp_buff[4]=(char)yloc;
    temp_buff[5]=(char)xsiz;
    temp_buff[6]=(char)ysiz;
    temp_buff[7]=0x0f;
    temp_buff[8]=0x0e;
    temp_buff[9]=0x00;
    temp_buff[10]=0x1b;  /* Select call */
    temp_buff[11]=0x21;
    temp_buff[12]=0x00;
    for(e=0;e<13;e++) write(path,&temp_buff[e],1);
    Select(0);          /* Regain control of keyboard and mouse */
}

Hope that helps! It should...  it's one of the _BIG_ secrets of
K-Windows developers...  just don't write any programs that are better
than mine, and I'll rest easier...  <grin>

     KiX 30 boot fail
     From: BRIANGOERS   To: ALL

Well I managed to mess up my hard drive.
 I had the CoCo 3 running as a terminal at 4800 baud on the KiX and changed
 back to a Televideo to read and edit some text files. The screen on the CoCo
 was not displaying the text properly, that why I switched them.
 I think I logout from the KiX but I am not positive now. I decided to change
 the terminal to 4800 also so I would not have to changed the setup when I
 put the CoCo back on it.

 I used a floppy disk to boot the system but it doesn't recognize the
 hard drive. So I am asking for any ideas on how to continue. Or should I just
 re-install the system.
 Below is what the startup screen looks like (Error #000:215 just continues
 none stop).

It sounds like that floppy disk is bad. Do you have the original 1

send you another bootable disk. Best bet would be to call me at work

     bad hard rive
     From: KEITHBAUER   To: ALL

I am wonderng if anybody has any ideas on what I could do with a damaged
hard drive. It is a Seagate ST157N 48 meg SCSI drive. It was running on my
MM/1 when one day I could no longer read anything or format. I have thought
about having it repaired but I am not sure where to send it or how much it
would cost. I do not want to spend too much on fixing it though. Right now it
is sitting on my shelf gathering dust.

Dear Keith:
Pick up a copy of Computer Shopper.  In the most recent issue, there must be
at least 5 or 6 companies that do hard drive repairs.  (They are all located
in California...Interesting new religions and hard driver repairers all seem
to come from California...)  In any case I think that some of the repair
prices start around $35.00.  I have an st-138n that I want to get repaired.

The bearing whine so bad that it drownes out the sound of a Dustbuster.

I will get a copy and check it out. $35.00 to $50.00 would be reasonable.

Rev, you can put a dab of silicone lubricant on the bottom bearing ot hte hard
drive.. the one that's exposed. A white lubricating grease if you can get it in
there! The other possibility is that the bearing may not be whining at all. The
grounding strap t
hat touches the end of the drive shaft can resonate at a high frequency and
cause a whine. a dab of silicone caulking compound or gasket making compound
(RTV) will change the frequency this resonates at and dampen the whine to near
nothing.
Just a couple cheap things to try in your case...

If you are willing to do a board transplant, you can have my hard disk
I really don't need it now that I have a pair of 85 meggers. It is
confirmed the logic board on mine is fried (i reversed 5/12 volts)
The drive will spin up and access its head and auto-park. but any access
to the disk hangs it with the LED on.

Changing the board isn't easy. It appears to have some mylar connectors
if your willing to do such a thing, let me know.

I've been involved with Bob Billson's UUCP 4.2 upgrade (UUCP 5.1bb now)
for over a year.  With Bob finally ready to release it, I have ported it
to OSK (using termcap) and am still debugging it.  I'm sure there's a
demand for an OSK version, but how much demand is there for an OS-9000
version?  I know there are a few OS-9000 users here, so if you would
like to see it, let me know.

In addition to UUCP 4.2, I've ported PALM (Jeff Shepler's great package)
to OSK and added termcap functionality as well.  PALM is a great mail
reader, and it should be fairly easy to port to OS-9000 as well.

With regards to the Multi-Vue project, I am still awaiting source code
from the guardian, Kent Meyers.

do to the fact that there wasn't a good (IMHO) UUCP package available for

When I get the new UUCP 5.1bb for OSK, I'll work on makeing sure Elm will
run with it, and then post it publically if there are no conflicts...

 There is an immediate need for a good port of UUCP to OSK.  I'm interested.

 Re OS-9000 - I'd be interested in that, too.  But I don't think there is
 much of a market for it, yet.  However, if you can do the port to OS-9000,
 I think it'll be worthwhile helping to sell OS-9000.  It would be nice

Rich,

Thanks for posting them. I am curious about those responces. I do not
monitor the COCO echo so I would like to see them.

Several things for everyone to remember.

 The coco is dead, no longer in production.

 No current OSK manuf. has made any inroads or sold any quanity in
the consumer market.

 If just a small percentage of CD-I owners converted their players
into computers it would likely create the largest single group of OSK
users ever.

 In order to have software developers create software for OSK we need
to show them large numbers of users. CD-I converted players are the
only product that I know of that could possibly do this.

I am going to spend a few hours over the next day or so rewriting my
proposal on this project. I will use the feedback I've received so far.

Most likely you are giving SZ a pathlist, and the pathlist does not reside
in the current directory tree, or in the /dd/SPOOL/UUCPPUBLIC dir tree.

Does that make sence? This feature is to provoid safegards for BBS systems
that use SZ as a file transfer protocal... I think in previous versions of
SZ, I had it check the uid, and only restrict users other then the superuser,
and just forgot to add that to the new source...

The files must be either in the current working directory, or a sub-directory
of the current working directory... futhermore... you can not referance
file names to be sent with "../" or "/dd"... This is a secureit feature
provoided
mostly for multi-user BBS systems...

the simple solution is to make sure you "CHD /h0/XFERS" before you try to

     .ar structure
     From: ESCHULMAN    To: ALL

I am interested in writing a clone of Ar 1.x for DOS or OS/2, preferably the
latter or even both.  I have some (mostly) C source for Ar.  However, I don't
C so it's of limited value (though I have figured out UNTC.C).  The DOS version
is to be written with Power Basic 3.0c, and the OS/2 version to be written with
CA-Realizer (which I don't have--yet).

Is there any documentation of the structure of a Ar 1.x file and the compression

and decompression algorithms?  Documentation a little more descriptive than C
source....

The final product will not be released to the public until and if I get
permission to do so.  And if cleared, it will be free.

I'd appreciate any help you can offer toward making this project a success.

     OSK Print Spooler
     From: JOELHEGBERG  To: ALL

How many OS-9/68k users out there use the Microware print spooler
supplied in the Programmer's Toolbox?  (The Toolbox comes on disk #4 of
the IMS distribution diskettes for MM/1 owners... I don't know, but am
very curious to find out, if the Programmer's Toolbox comes with other
OS-9/68k systems?)  I started using it today, and it works great!!  My
printer buffer is very small, and this is fantastic.  I've added support
for it in Write-Right! and I am very pleased how it works!  With the
spooler option active, Write-Right! takes about 3 seconds to format a
7-page document and another second to call the Microware spooler, and
then, with the document printing in the background, Write-Right! returns
to editing mode.  You can print multiple documents, which are held by
the print spooler until the printer is available.

The print spooler really is a powerhouse!  It has options for jobnames,
prints job header pages (with those really big ascii character fonts,
just like the university computer do), and have options for use with
networked OS-9 systems sharing a printer with a number of systems.  I'm
just surprised I haven't heard of anyone else using it yet, so thought
I'd see if anyone had been using it.  Man, Write-Right! flies with this
feature!  I'm happy!  :)

I used the print spooler for a while when I first got my MM/1. For some
strange reason, I was sent two patch cables with connectors for both printer
devices, /p and /p1, so I have both devices in my bootlist. Unfortunately,
the driver we currently have cannot handle concurrent access to both devices.
Starting up a spooler for /p works fine. But when you try to start one
for /p1, the whole thing goes crazy, ultimately making spooling unusable.

As of right now, I only am using a single printer, but I like having a
couple of different kinds out there. Laser for high quality stuff and
dot matrix for cheap draft/working copies and program listings.

So, no, I am not currently using the print spooler, but yes, I have used
it and yes, it does work really neat!!!

     From: ISC          To: ALL

I am having a problem in trying to use a TEAC 55F floppy drive as an 80
track /d0.  It works OK as /d1, but when I move the select jumper to /d0
and connect it as such, it gives I/O errors in DECB and continuously
seeks if I try an OS9 diskette.  It reads both 40 and 80 track floppies
fine as /d1.  What else am I missing?

Thanks in advance.

Which drive has your bus termination resistors?  Make sure when you move
the TEAC to become /d0, that you still have one (only one) drive active
on the system that has the termination resistors installed.

A friend who is a dealer for USRobotics is letting me try out a 14.4K Sporster

Ken, CoNect's CoCoIO board has met a few more problems than anticipated,
of course. It is being worked on, and hopefully will be out soon. In the
mean time, go grab SuperComm v2.2, and it's related files. 2.2 was done
specificly to do 9600 reliably. Oh, and if you haven't already, snarf Eddie's
Clock edition 9 upload. I found that some clock modules (in my case Disto)
ate up so much system time that serial was limited to 4800.

     Basic 09 CHAIN command
     From: JWILKERSON   To: ALL

   I need to use the basic09 chain statement, however the manual is a bit
cryptic.

Here is what I wish to do.

I want to take a file and replace each letter in the file with a number.  This
essentially encrypts the file.  The program to do this is the CoCopro tools
program "fconvert"  I will be writing a B09 program that inputs the file name
of the file to encrypt.
here is what I want it to do

Input "file to encode"
Call Fconvert to replace "letter" with "letter" in "file to encrypt"
go back to b09 to get next letter in sequence, then return to fconvert
end program at end of alphabet.

Essentially, I want to automativally

oops automatically run fconvert 26 times (once for each letter of the
alphabet to process the file"  The filename must be passed each time, as
well as the letter of the alphabet to be converted

Syntax:  Fconvert (letter to change) (new letter) (file in which to look)
B09:  CHAIN Fconvert (letter) (new letter) (file)

(letter) and (newletter) will be the result of a loop, incrementing each pass.
(file) is the result of an input statement at the beginning of the file.

I will, of course, need to know also, how to chain back to the b09 file.

All in all, an explanation of how to use chain in this manner is all I need.


Any suggestions...

Thanks

     RE: Basic 09 CHAIN command (Re: Msg 83704)
     From: RANDYKWILSON To: JWILKERSON

John, I have a suggestion. Don't use CHAIN!!!! Chain causes thenew, called,
process to totally replace the current one (in this case runb/basic09). RunB
will be gone; no way to reenter in the middle of the loop.
 Instead, use the RUN command. This equates to a F$FORK and then a F$Wait
system call. When the called process dies (exits), control will be returned
to RunBright where it left off. Something like:
 dim param_string:STRING
 ...
 param_string="prog_name"+" "+old_char+" "+new_char+" "+file_name
 RUN SHELL(param_string)

 Note that thiscode fragment is not tested....  :>

   Not 10 mins after I posted this, I discovered chain.  But, I couldn't
figgure out the proper usage.  I'll follow your example here and see what
I can do.  Hopefully, with a little experience with b09 I can write a
totally self-contained text file encryption program.

Well, I use OSTerm on my MM/1!  :)
But, for the CoCo under RS-DOS, I use UltimaTerm as well, and you should
be able to set the 7-E-1 up on it.  I think you just hit ALT-O for
options, then 'M' for modem parameters (recalling that from memory,
though).

     RiBBS/RS232 Pak
     From: DENNYWRIGHT  To: WESGALE (NR)

I have a copy of RiBBS v2.10 and a concerted modem pak I built using your
docs and 1488 and 1489 driver/reciever chips. The docs to ribbs say to
switch pins #6 and #8 on one end of the cable. I did this and set the
                rconfig file to look for an inverted cable. When I start RiBBS a
t the bottom
of the wait screen I see:

<- 93/12/03 20:00:41                Carrier Detected
ATH0
OK

Then after a minute it says no response from modem. Then it tries to log in
a user, shows the logo screen, then shows the waitmsg saying there's an event
scheduled, to plesase call back later and resets. I then get the above message
at the
wait screen again before it does the whole thing over again. I also cannot
execute
any of the options at the wait screen I should be able to.       How should I mo
dify
my cable to correct the problem?
If I switch the cable back to normal RiBBS works but users can't call in and
log on.
I can log in in local mode ok though.
Can you tell me what wires to swap?
Thanks and sorry about the choppines of this message. I'm new at this.
