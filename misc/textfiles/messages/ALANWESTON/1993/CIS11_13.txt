Carl,

Keith Alphonso had some sort of a problem with Shell+ when he tried to run his
HDTree program (as I recall), so he supplied instructions on how to allow Shell
and Shell+ to co-exist.

As I recall he made a copy of the original shell in an unpacked form, then used
ded or some other utility to change the name in the header to "shelp" which
matched the name that he'd copied shell to.  When he need to run his HDTree (or
whatever program had the problem with SHELL+), he'd start "SHELP" in a window
instead of "Shell"(+).

It's been a long time since I saw the demo that he was doing, back at one of
the Chicago Rainbowfests, but I remember doing a "PROCS" and seeing that both
SHELL and SHELP were in the task list.  I asked what "SHELP" was and he then
explained about his program's problem with shell+.  It could be that he
internally called SHELP and passed stuff to it, it's been along time since I
got the explanation.

p.s.  How are you and Debra doing?

Bill, So I have the dilemma.....do I take the currently unsupported stuff out
of Shell+...or wait for the other stuff to come out? In fact will it come out?
Have the other features been offically (or unofficially) dropped, never to be
seen again? As a point of interest.....have you realized that the 5 year time
restraint has passed?

Ron,

I don't know what the status of the other features is at this point. I had
either forgotten about the 5 year limit, or never knew about it. I looked for
my copy of the agreement, but didn't find it, although I didn't look all that
hard. Kevin has all of it, and he was the one that set the whole thing up, so I
guess its up to him. The new new improved Users Group is trying to persuade
Microware to release the source to 6809 OS9 to them. I'm sure they would be
interested in getting their hands on the LII upgrade, too.

If I were you, I'd wait a bit to see what happens. If nothing looks like its
going to happen, release a version without the new stuff. You can always
release the new stuff if/when the rest of the upgrade appears. You could also
talk to whoever wrote the stuff you need, didn't Chris Burke do all the data
module code? But then it might need other parts of the upgrade to function. I
need to dust off that set of utilities I started working on that take advantage
of the Shell+ 3.0 features.

I'm not sure exactly what new features Shell+ will gain if you go ahead, but I
can tell you one or two I would dearly love to have (both of which, I am
reluctant to say, are standard in MSDOS' shell). First, the ability to pass
parameters to a script file by including them on the command line. This would
allow script files to look just like programs, and would allow programs with
complex parameters to be called via a simple script. For example, using the
script file called "print" which contains

     vpt %1 -e -i=vpt..dwp -o=/p1

could be used to print a file by simply typing

     print myfile

and "myfile" would automatically be passed to %1 without the need for a var.1
command.

Second, expanded wild card handling. With MSDOS shell, for example, I can do
something like:

      rename *.prn *.txt

to rename all matching files in a directory. I really miss this in OS9.

Whaddya think?

There is a utility available called ren that will rename files that way.  It
has it's own wildcard handling, so you'll have to put the ":" in front of the
command line.  It's sort of like a batch program though as it calls the rename
command (or at least appears to).

Probally the reason. oh well
     Incidently you do not know if there is any programs for the Coco other
than STERM that uses the TERMCAP LIBRAIRY of the sterm package do you?

Sb: Termcap stuff for 6809
Fm: Michele Dalene 72652,2765
To: [F] all

Dear sir:
     I am looking for a program that goes with the Mark Griffith C Termcap
Librairy called Setterm which configures the /dd/sys/ttype file have you seen
this program around? I did not check my orignal archive but I think I
downloaded it from either a BBS or DElphi so I thought I would ask if you have
seen it or maybe you know of who has this ditty?
     I also am looking for a copy of SLED (NOT SCRED!!!!) that is compiled for
Termcaps? Aparently the oldie I have could be compiled but everytime I try I
get nasty Syntax errors during C.pass2 so I gave up on the program. I want the
finished 6809 Object code!! I also would die for any disk editors that are
Termcap based instead of getting Nasty with DED and MODPATCHING the whole
monster for a specific terminal type and get stuck with a DED verson for the
Coco or my VT100 compatible terminal (A Visual 100 brick :))
     Please respond ASASP with some input. Also I did download when it was here
a tiny ditty calleld Tcap.ar which allows termcap I/O from the command line
but... it uses NAMED PIPES in OS9 Level 2 and I have yet to decide a good
substitute for this lacking feature. Does anyone have shareware pipes?

I'm thinking there is a bug in 1.14:5 somehow related to VT100's clear screen
home cursor escape sequences. If there is a vdu file for the VT100 for this
version I would be interested in seeing it.

Thanks,
