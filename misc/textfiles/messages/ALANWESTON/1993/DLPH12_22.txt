     MM/1 GWindows
     From: JOELHEGBERG  To: ALL

    After sitting back and analyzing the FHL G-Windows offer made
recently, I would like to make a few comments and see how other MM/1
owners view the situation.

    I'm very leary of the FHL G-Windows MM/1 port offer for several
reasons.  First, one night it's unsupported, the next night it's
supported.  Frank Hogg is a great guy (really), but the question of
support from FHL is a serious one.  Going from unsupported to supported
on the fly like that doesn't give me additional confidence in his
version of the G-Windows port.  FHL doesn't seem to give out the latest
versions of software (G-Windows edition 37, OSK V2.3, etc.).  I'm not
sure I believe I will always have an up-to-date port of G-Windows
throughout the support timeframe.  On the other hand, I've heard many
stories of how Delmar provides timely updates to their customers.

    Second, look at the TC-9 and TC-70 computers.  They are no longer
being built.  From what I hear, the TC-70 came with OSK V2.3 and I'm not
sure what kind of support is being given to those owners.  Is FHL
providing an update to version 2.4? In any case, Delmar's System IV and
System V computers are still being sold and supported.  Ed Gresick (of
Delmar) is available at all CoCoFests I've been to, while FHL is not a
regular attender.  I like Delmar's accessibility.

    Third, I don't recall the name of the person FHL is putting in
charge of it's MM/1 G-Windows port...  in fact, his name didn't ring a
bell in my mind when I read it.  He very well may be a good programmer,
but I don't recall seeing anything else done by that person.  Who is he?
Will he be at CoCoFests? Does he have the technical skills to keep
G-Windows for MM/1 up to date? One thing I do know is Ed Gresick has
successfully ported G-Windows over to his System computers, and even to
OS-9000.  From what I hear, though, "successfully" is an understatement,
as Ed uses assembly-language optimization and graphics chip features to
increase the efficiency of the port.  I doubt the programmer for FHL
MM/1 G-Windows has this type of experience.

    For these reasons, I'm staying solidly behind the Delmar G-Windows
MM/1 port offer.  I honestly believe it's the port MM/1 owners would be
most happy with, and would get the best value from.  I want to emphasize
that I am not against Frank Hogg, but rather I've seen and heard some
problems with their "supported" products.

    I would like to hear comments on how other MM/1 owners feel who have
been awaiting a G-Windows port.

     From: EDELMAR      To: ALL

 It's a shame Frank Hogg can't stick to facts and performance and has to
 resort to theatrics, hysterics and rhetoric.  He totally ignores his lies
 re the SYSTEM V.  He does not deny his hardware uses OSK Version 2.3 vs
 Version 2.4 nor his use of an obselete version of G-WINDOWS.  Further, he
 does not indicate any intent to upgrade his systems to current versions.
 Since he isn't supporting his products with upgrades, one can only wonder
 what kind of on-going support he will provide to software effecting a
 competitor's product.

 I think it's sufficient to say that my work has been subject to public
 scrutiny at 3 different shows; i.e., Chicago, San Diego and Atlanta.
 At the Atlanta show, several visitors did request verification of the
 test results I claimed here and in my advertising.  I was able to do
 this and subtantiated my claims.  In fact, the benchmark tests results
 were slightly better than I claim in my advertising.  At the San Diego
 show and the Atlanta show, comments were made comparing the performance
 of the SYSTEM V/G-WINDOWS favorably with SUN work-stations.  To my knowledge,
 Hazelwood/FHL's work has never been shown publicly and their claims have
 never been verified.  Further, FHL's claim of the fastest G-WINDOWS port
 under OS-9 is false.  There are at least 2 other ports from other OEM's that
 have performance far superior to that claimed by FHL.  The burden of proof
 of his claims is on FHL.  IMO, all other claims and statements from Frank
 Hogg should be taken in the same context.

 To Ed and Frank..
   I"m not concerned with claims, hot dogging, or theatrics. What I am
concerned with is wisely spending my money. FHL has been approached
repeatedly in the past about a port of GWindows for the MM/1. Up until
very recently, FHL has shown no interest in such a port.
 Now he does. If he had decided to do this at this time last year, I would
probably be running a FHL version of GWindows today. As for which would be
faster, there is a very simple way to find out. Simply SEND BOTH VERSIONS
to Mark GRiffith. He is not currently involved in the development of
either version, he has in depth knowledge of the MM/1 and MM/1a computers,
and is held in high regard by everyone in the community.

I totally agree.  That's what the debate should be about.

I agree again, that Mark Griffith would be the person to send both
versions to if speed were the issue (and if both versions were available
for testing).  Still, although I have more faith in Ed Gresick's
assembly optimization experience (so I would think the Delmar port would
be slightly faster), I doubt there will be any noticeable difference
that would make or break one's decision to buy G-Windows from FHL or
Delmar.  The problem I have is with the "support" that FHL may (or may
not) provide us with.  After posting my message, quite a few people have
written to me regarding FHL "horror stories".  The stories are not about
the quality of FHL products (Frank has tremendous experience in building
and designing computer systems), but rather with the support they
receive after purchase, and the outdated software they receive with
their purchase.

As this is a software/support issue, I definitely have to back the
Delmar G-Windows port.

 At San Diego this year ('93) the System V (68020-25mhz) running G-Windows
 that Ed loaned the San Diego OS9UG was perceived by show visitors (and some
 participants!) to be noticeably faster than the '486's running Windows in
 the Micrsoft booth about 30 feet away.  At least one visitor to the booth
 thought the machine was a SUN workstation.

 I am not claiming that the System IV is faster than a '486 clone but the
 combination of Ed'd port of G-Windows with the System IV did _appear_ faster
 to people visiting the booth.

In the computer world most standards committees are working on standards based
on what will be possible in the near future.  SCSI-2 is one example.  The buss
was designed, prototyped and turned over to a committee to write up all of the
standards.  The whole idea is to keep manufacturers from floundering around
blindly creating computers or ancillary components that will not work with the
other subsystems which are either in design, prototyping or production.  In a
market that is updating approximately every 18 months this is a necessity.  I
venture to guess most products (like cars) do not get full revamps that fast.

The 640x480 mode on the VSC is an interlace mode... The basic modes that woul
work on a VGA (31kHz) monitor have resolutions of 160x480x256, and 320x480x16.
Not really usefull modes... So, any GWindows port for an MM/1 will probably
be using the 640x480x16 interlaced mode (or more likely the wider 740 width
overscaned mode, to get maximumm pixel space)

You can use use type 7 screen (which is 768x480) and use it just like
any other screen under K-Windows, including overlapping windows.  It's
the screen I like to use when I have multiple applications running on
the same screen.

Hi, Keith -

Sorry that you've been having problems getting your new modem to work
properly.  Wish I had one so that I could contribute some specific
recommendations!  However, I am using a Microcom AX/2400c (2400 baud
with MNP5), and it doesn't even have the AT&Kx command you folks have
been discussing.

But perhaps I can provide a few comments that might help:

There is a file on the Ocean Beach BBS (619- 224-4878) describing how
to enable CTS/RTS handshaking.  (I believe it is called something like
t3fix.ar.)  However, I think you have covered most of the steps:
xmode type=80, and strap RTS/DTR toggled (P4 pins 1-2 and 5-6 strapped;
3|4 and 7|8 unstrapped) and DTE mode (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12
strapped).

Set the modem to H/W handshaking -- I guess your modem uses AT&K3 for
this.  Mine uses AT\Q3.

You mentioned that you are setting your MM/1 port to 19200.  High speed
modems have a nice feature where you can lock the modem-computer speed
to a fixed value, regardless of the "CONNECT" rate.  However, both the
modem and telecom program need to be set up (co-ordinated) to make this
work.  For my modem, it is called the "BPS rate adjust" feature, and
AT\J0 tells the modem to lock the computer-side rate, regardless of the
connection speed.  (AT\J1 tells the modem to change the computer-side
to the same speed as the connection.)  Your modem may already be set up
to lock the computer connection speed (AT\J0 for mine; yours will probably
be different.)  For OSTerm 68K to work properly with this setup, you will
need to tell it to lock the baud rate as well (rather than autobauding),
otherwise after connection, the modem will be communicating at 19200,
and your computer will be listening at 2400, due to the "CONNECT 2400"
message received.  There should be a readme
file on your distribution disk describing the FIXEDBAUD environment
variable temporarily used for this purpose in the Alpha release of OSTerm 68K.
("setenv FIXEDBAUD whatever").  In the upcoming release this will be
handled in the osterm.config file, with entries like:
    PORT    = /t0, 2400
    PORT    = /t3, 9600, LOCKED
 OSTerm will match the entry for the current port, and set up accordingly.

You will also want to go through your IX "*.ini" files and change the
baud rates listed to 19200.

This may help with your "connect, but no response" results with AT&K3.

Good luck, and keep us posted.

Just thought I would follow up and fill in the missing info <g>.

TasCOM did have a problem "mangling the type byte", which caused problems
using x/ymodem transfers, especially with hardware handshaking.

This was one of the first fixes made when we upgraded it to OSTerm 68K.

I believe the latest and greated of the sc68681 is edition 32 and can be found
in CompuServe's OS9 Forum. That's where Carl's been making his updates

Something else to check is the input/output buffer sizes of /t3. These can

That's the current edition of the driver so you're in good shape there.
You've got something weird with the hardware handshaking settings ... perhaps
on the paddle board itself. There are jumpers that can be set to control
the handling of RTS/CTS ... whether to keep 'em high all the time, or let
them float. You need the later for proper operation. How are they set?

 > Do you have different INIT strings for IX and your term program?

I'm not using anything special in my init string with IX. All that's there
is  atmx4^m  . I'm using the factory defaults for the modem's parameters which
includes the &K3 setting for hardware handshaking.


I'm betting it's the jumpers on your paddle board. Let us know what you find.

The jumpers on P4 control the logic of RTS and DTR.  The jumper is labeled as:

  1 * * 2
  3 * * 4
  5 * * 6
  7 * * 8

looking at the paddle board with the DB-9 to the left.  Jumpering pins 1 and 2
allow RTS to toggle freely.  Jumpers across 3 and 4 tie RTS high.  Jumpering
pins 5 and 6 allow DTR to toggle freely while jumpering 7 and 8 tie it high.

Hope this helps!

Has anyone ever hacked into Edit (plain vanilla) and found a way of
getting it *not* to indent 3 spaces when it's listing?

It makes a pretty powerful mail reader, but the format's annoying.
Looked through a disassembly briefly (very) but didn't see anything,
even searching for the Write system calls.

Best of the season,
Tony.

Ahhhh......I wonder who Bob is going to tap on the shoulder to try it.
Someone who can blow up a computer just by looking at it I assume (evil grin).
Actually, I had no doubts about the port since Bob and I are friends from
way back.  I know he does good stuff.
