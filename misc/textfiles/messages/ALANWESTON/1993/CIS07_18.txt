I've heard that Windsor Systems in Kentucky is a distributor... anyone have
their address/phone?

Sb: ar beta testers needed
Fm: Carl Kreider 71076,76
To: all

I just dropped off a beta version of the new ar in the utils dl (9 I hope).
Could anyone who still runs an 09 check it out and report back?

In summary, it is smaller, faster, and has more features.  A clear case of
having your cake and eating it too, right?  Well, not really.

It is actually a bit bigger with the delete code in it (I could leave that out
if no one cares...)  but it should still fit on two pages of coco memory.  How
much is left at the top of the process space on the coco? How big can it grow
before it takes three pages?

It is twice as fast (unless you are disk I/O bound).  I can't help much here
without burning memory needed for compression tables for disk buffers.

It will still extract from old archives (make by ar 1.2) and will still make
old archives.  I can't say whether it will extract from archives made with any
of the modified versions (unless they didn't change the compression).

It will compress much better.  In fact, I now default to compressing binaries
since it generally helps.  It defaults to 13 bit, but you can choose anyting in
9 to 13.  I can get more on OSK, but I can't get more than 13 bit tables in 64K
(compression takes 48K, burst takes 32K). You won't make or break 13 bits on
LI, but 12 should be ok there.  I presume you will let me (and others) know ;)

Delete isn't quite right yet - it won't do more than one file at once.

I haven't put in the directory walk code yet (so naming a directory on the
command line would archive that tree).  Or is this not desireable?

Type ar2 -? for a synopsis.

Anybody out there have a handle on a PC-based 6809 development system that is
compatible with the VAX-based MICROBENCH 6809 Development System? What we are
trying to do is set up a software development facility that is PC based, but
can readily use source code that was developed on our parent company's system.
Any suggestions would be welcomed.

Thanks,

Bob,

        For what it is worth, I would pay a few bucks for a good cribbage game.
I know where just tell me how much.

Thanks

Keith, I am going to try to sell a few copies of the crib game. Probably be
only 20 bucks. I'm going to work on some docs this week and make sure it is all
working. Then I'll post an announcement here listing all the gory details.
Thanks for the interest!

        Geeeeeeez, and all this time I have been putting a separate compiler
command after EVERY ".r" file in the list.  That's the only way I could get it
to work.  (sheepish GRIN)

How do!

Does anyone here have any familiarity at all with the Phillips CD-I player?
This is the machine that they are selling at Sears, etc. that plays all those
educational disks. Well, anyhoo... That machine runs on OS-9 on a 68070
processor.

Also... Has anyone had any experience with Ultra Science's port of OS9 to the
Macintosh?

Lay it on me...

About the only familiarity I have with CDI is beacuse I tried it out at Sears
last year.  At the time I thought it was severely overpriced.  My MM1 uses the
68070 CPU and other chips used in the CDI machines. However, no CDI
capabilities yet  :-(

Interesting you should ask the question here, when I know f'sure you're a spy
from the MultiMedia forum.  Makes me wonder a) how many other CD-I people also
monitor this forum, and b) whether there's any real relevance in the machine
happening to run OS-9 rather than, say, MS-DOS.  Would it make a lot of
difference to the way we develop applications?

As a CD-I software developer, I find the discussions in this forum, although
occasionally interesting, are mostly about getting hardware and drivers to
work, preoccupations somewhat removed from the problems I usually face.  I do
however echo your interest in OS-9 on the Mac.
