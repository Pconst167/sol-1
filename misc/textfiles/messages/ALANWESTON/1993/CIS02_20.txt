Brother Jeremy,

        Did you receive my letters yet?  Just wondering, since I haven't gotten
anything back yet.  I got plenty of packing materials from work, and everything
is packed good.  There will be 4 boxes of hardware and one box of books.  I
have a feeling it will cost us about $25-30 each.  There is a lot of stuff
there.  I hope you enjoy all of it.

Hey Bob,  I think the main problem is LAP-M.  I setup my modem to only use
V.32 and MNP 5 and have had none of the symptoms your having since.  There
should be an AT code to turn off the LAP-M correction.

I use to get errors so bad that long DL's would abort about 9/10ths of the
way thru.  Really is painful on 2 meg DL's.

Let me know if this helps you out.

Ummm, Mike, I don't recall what errors were are talking about. However, LAP-M
(the same as v42) works fine for me. I'm having no problems at all talking to
CIS these days. Well, I did "fix" the input buffer overflow problem with the
mm/1 screens getting behind sterm. I don't use v42.bis at all (could that be a
problem?).

Hi Bob!
        I saw your upload of UNZIP.LZH for MM/1 and was wondering if
 the source for that is the current version available in IBMPRO
 with inflate?  What is the probability of compiling it for Coco successfully?
        I have been playing with the code, but I have no programming backround.
 Have even gotten it to run through to the linker, though I'm a bit suspicious
 that it will all fit in memory. This has become a rather critical issue
 for me since the archive feeds I get from the FAA of the Federal Register
 no longer work with Vaughn Cato's unzip3.[sigh]
        All I've done so far is #define it for UNIX and remove or comment out
exotic #if statements.
 Thx

The unzip I have was mailed to me by a friend who got it from a unix source.
The 'readme' says "A public distribution version of the Info-ZIP project's
generic UnZip utility; 21 August 1992." My binary is 55K, so I would think that
it _should_ fit in the coco3 since the binaries are usually much smaller there
due to shorter opcodes. Mind you, I see I have linked in 64K of stack space
too...so it might not. If you want I could send you the whole mess on a disk
(the source is about 300K so I don't want to waste $ on uploading). Send me a
formatted disk in a mailer and I'll copy the mess over for you.

BTW, as I recall, I ended up using GCC to compile this. Plus I needed a number
of unix functions...some from gcc and others from blarslib.l. Neither of which
will help you on the coco.

 The file I've been messing with carries the same banner and date as yours.
 It came with compiling instructions and .proj files for a BUNCH of computers.
  I'm guessing that the unix functions were ANSI standard library functions
 such as you might find in the Bourland C++ package? I stumbled across a
 book of source code for the ANSI standard C library (Plauger 1990) which
 <SHOULD> take care of that if it will just fit in memory. Too much tinkering
 and I'll have to throw in the towel. Linked lists and the like are **way**
 beyond what I'm capable of doing..

I don't think you'll have to resort to the Plauger book too much. The problem
is mostly a bunch of missing unix-like calls. I think there is a file around
here (unix.lib or something ....anyone recall for 6809???) which has most of
the missing stuff. Let us know how you fare.

I have a DISTO SCII with 4-in-1, and I cannot seem to get the serial port to
work.  I have ACIAPAK.DR and have it patched as specified, using /t2 as the
descriptor. I also used to use Wizpro, soI have PROACIA.DR and the descriptor
/mwp. Both descriptors are set for the right address $07FF54, and name their
respectively appropriate drivers. With /mwp, I can write to the modem, but
cannot receive.  With a loopback connector and using a 'scope, with 'xcom9
/mwp' I see data xmitted, but no characters echo, although DTR is fed back to
DSR and CD.

With /t2 and the "correct" driver, the transmit line is dead. (scope shows
constant -ve voltage).

Is there something wrong with my software or understanding, or is my 6551
toasted?  I don't want to risk hacking at the 4-in-1 board to replace it if its
not a hardware problem.

Urgently required to get my system useful again.

I am looking for help with my 1 meg upgrade and the  6309. Recently I installed
the 6309 processor with Power Boost and everything ran fine for the first two
months. A week ago I installed the 1 meg board to the processor and shorted the
proper resistor. The system works, but two of the three Ram drivers that I have
(Rammer by Kevin Darling and RDISK ) both crash the system either while being
formatted or after being formatted when a file is copy to /R0. I tried changing
R22 to a 47 ohm resister and the problem continues. No other problems have been
encountered except somtimes deiniz will lock the system up. I have also tried
changing the 512 K board with a spare board but this does nothing. Moreover,
Kyumgai to be Ninja and other VDG based programs run fine in a VDG window. The
Ram Driver that came with the OS9 development package works fine. Any ideas on
what is happening would be greatly appreciated.

Sounds like the upgrade(s) are working fine but the software isn't. I guess the
easiest thing to do is just use the ramdisk which works <grin>. I do recall
some chatter awhile ago about patches to both Kevin's ramdrive and a patch to
the Dev. Pack ramdrive. If everything else is okay, it doesn't sound like a
hardware problem to me.

Bob,

 > Can anyone shed some light on xon/off for me when it comes to device
 > descriptors. I'm confused about just how these things work.

Sure.  In Sterm, it doesn't matter what you have your hardware descriptor set
to.  Sterm nulls out the entire descriptor and manages everthing itself. As you
found, the only time it uses XON/XOFF is during a buffer capture, and that is
only necessary with the CoCos.

If you don't null out the descriptor, the driver will send an XOFF when the 
drivers internal buffer gets full, and an XON when some room is available.

Hardware handshaking is another thing altogether, but much like XON/XOFF. With
the high speed modems, there is need for some sort of handshaking between the
modem and the computer.  Since you don't want to use XON/XOFF as you already
noted, RTS/CTS handshaking is used instead.  In fact, the higher speed modems
require this to be used properly.

Hope this helps some.

doing a port for it, they are not machine people unless they get big bucks from

OK people, I'm getting worried. I ordered an MM1 in November, my credit card
was charged on December 16th, but to date, no MM1. Apparently, there has been a
problem in obtaining good PAL chips.

On a whim, I called IMS today only to find their phone has been temporarily
disconnected.  This is a not a good sign and makes me wonder if buying an MM1
was a good idea.

I ordered the unit through Blackhawk Enterprises (an IMS rep). David Graham has
been as helpful as possible, but the delay is getting ridiculous, and the slow
disappearance of Paul Ward is worrisome.  First he dropped off Delphi, now he's
gone from Compuserve.

I'm especially worried because I've already paid off the bill, trusting soul
that I am.

Does anyone know what's going on?  If yes, please let me know.

Hugo,

Paul has been going through some very difficult times lately.  He has had a
number of orders waiting on PAL chips for a couple months now. I don't know
what the problem is there, whether there isn't enough money to buy the chips or
if they are back-ordered.  I sent him a few sets of PALs that I had so he can
at least get those orders out. After that, I don't know.  Paul has been slow
getting orders out in that past, but as far as I know, everyone has received
what they ordered after the charge to the credit card was made.

Hope this relieves your fears somewhat.

Well, you are asking me this question in the OS-9 forum you know.  OS-9 is a
multi-tasking, multi-user operating system for the Motorola CPUs (6809, 68000
series, etc.) that looks and operates much like Unix, but is much more modular
and easy to use.

I don't have their address handy, but someone else here will be able to give
you the address and phone number for Microware Systems, the people that make
OS-9.  They will be able to send you more information if you like.

Not that I don't want to talk to you, but it is difficult to explain about the
entire operating system.  If you have any specific questions, I'll be able to
answer them for you.

is why I wish Microware still had their little section
 up because they had menu options that gave a great big summary on
 the products including OS/9. Have you ever heard of OSK? That IS OS9 under a
different name.
