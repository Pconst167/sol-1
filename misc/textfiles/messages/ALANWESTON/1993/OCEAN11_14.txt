-> when it comes to the control of a game, which would everyone rather do,
-> go through the hassles of dealing with the joystick problem, 
-> or forego the hassle of the joystick and use the keyboard for control, 
-> even  though using the keyboard for control causes a noticable drop in
-> game control response time?
 
I personally would prefer to go through the hassle of building an
extender cable (or even have someone who knows what they're doing build
it for me) and play with the joystick.  Since a standard backplane does
not have most of its openings large enough to use a round joystick plug, 
and since the MM/1 HAS a joystick port, I'd rather jump through hoops to 
get the port to work rather than have yet another portion of my machine
unuseable.  Malcolm

Clyde, I can't promise to fill all orders outstanding with IMS, but 
will try to help Paul fill them.   Note that I'm not buying the company, 
but rights to the computer.   The best way I can think of to speed
delivery is for reps to buy at least one or two machines and keep them
in stock.   I need to show some FIRM orders to my bankers.

   If you have a copy of
 
PERSONAL ENGINEERING & INSTRUMENTATION NEWS
 
look on pages 28 - 29. Microware has a blurb on the NEW OS9 V3.0 and the 
Atomic OS9 microkernel.

        Mentioning graphics and BBS programs,
        Is anybody working on the RIP graphics protocol for _any_ OSK 
machine?  The standards for it are widely distributed, and lots of BBSs 
are moving to it as a preferred display.
        Including RIP in a com program might even lead to other Termcap 
entries and enable spiffier multiuser applications.
        Could a "windowing" program make use of RIP for remote shell 
users?
  
        (On an old but continuing question:)
        Does anybody have a functioning vanilla-OSK Usenet newsgroup & 
uucp email program functioning as either leaf or node?
        The programmer I had working on porting the Waffle BBS to OSK 
gave up, and the arrangements with the author, Thomas Dell, to 
distribute binaries would have been extreemly complicated anyway, but 
even an instruction file on how to modify and compile Waffle into OSK 
could put a BUNCH of MM/1's (and other OSK machines) onto the sitemaps.

Clyde,
     Perhaps the comprehensive mailer 'binkley' includes a internet
function.  Ask John A Donaldson who is working on the MM/1 port of the
FIDO mailer binkley.
