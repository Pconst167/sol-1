The message looks fine, so you must have gotten InfoXpress working. Congrats!

Yes ... the Supra uses the Rockwell chipset. They've been "beta"ing a new rev
that supposedly fixes the problems but ....

On the jumpers ... I've got em both (/t3 and /t4) set to enable hardware
handshaking. I use the SupraFax modem on /t3 with the port set to 19200 and
another Supra 2400 on /t4. Both are doing just fine.

This should be in the 'toggle' position.

Thanks Bob, I will make up a list of the ones that are being used so I have

Sb: Dropped characters
Fm: Jon Beach 70004,1607
To: all

I have just recently started getting back into using my CoCo 3 for
telecommunications, I have started having a problem with dropped characters
that was not present previously.  There have been changes to my system, both
hardware and software and I wonder if I could have any help from you guys in
solving this problem.

Previously, I was using an FD-501 disk controller and my modem was attached to
the built-in serial port on the computer.  I had installed a hardware 
modification ("The Forgotten Chip" hack from the Rainbow Magazine) which
basically was an internal modification that provided full ACIA support through
the built in port without any external hardware (like a program pak). This ACIA
is addressed at $FF30 and had an IRQ line tied directly to the 6809.

I was using the stock CC3Disk driver modified for 512 byte sector support, the
stock ACIAPAK driver modified for a 256 byte buffer and the stock T2 descriptor
modified for the $FF30 ACIA address.  My primary terminal program was the
shareware verision of Eddie Kuns's K-BCOM terminal program, though I did use
OS-TERM by Vaughn Cato.

Since then, I started using a Disto Super Controller-II with a 3-n-1 Mini
Expansion Board which provided an additional serial port (addressed at $FF54).
I am also using the CC3Disk driver supplied with the SC-II which provides
no-halt disk by sleeping when not in use (as opposed to the one using IRQ). The
IRQ for the serial port is tied directly to the IRQ pin in the cartridge port.

Additionally, I started using Bruce Isted's SACIA driver (with matching
descriptors) which I have set to support maximum buffer size (which is a few
K).  Also, I have added various of the Level 2 "upgrade" patches like the
kernal patch for filenames.  Also, I have in addition to the above terminal
programs, I have started using STERM which is the best program that supports
the CIS B protocl.

I have tried various configurations of ACIA drivers and the several versions of
CC3Disk and the problem is less obvious using the SACIA driver and the no-halt
CC3Disk that sleeps.  However, the problem is still present.  I cannot go back
to using the internal ACIA circuit because a side-effect of using the no-halt
disk drivers (either version) is that garbage is occasionally sent out the
built in serial port (though the problem disappears if I use the stock or
512-sector versions of CC3Disk).

Any ideas on this problem? I have drawn a blank on all solutions.

Jon Beach

P.S.  I forgot to mention it but my modem runs at 1200 baud and my T2
descriptor is XMODE'd accordingly.

Hi Bill,

Had to try out InfoXpress as soon as I got home from the fest.  Even at 2am,
and after driving about 300 miles, the installation went very well.  The
program only choked once, because I had my modem set up to ignore DTR (a
leftover part of a temporary cure for early problems with "/T0"). Once I set it
to `read and heed DTR' it did a better job of hanging up the phone.  This is
the program's first outgoing message.   Nice Job.

Scott,

InfoXpress is a "auto-nav" communications program for OS9/OSK. It allows you to
define your favorite places on CompuServe and Delphi and then will nab and
process your mail and forum messages unattended.

It works grand on the MM/1 (been running it for a loooong time!), and there's
an official version for the CoCo as well. It's been tested on a TC70 with some
success (depending on the serial port used), not sure of it's status on one of
Ed's machines, tho. Perhaps they had a chance to test it at the 'fest.

It's a commercial offering. Drop a note to Bill Dickhaus for more info if he
doesn't already pipe up and answer your message as well.

Mike,
     I'll try that pause before the Select(0).
  I'm beginning to think I have a problem here with WINDIO or the window
descriptors.
  I had thought originally that when you do a Select(Wpath) after Wpath has
been opened (Wpath - open("/w",3)), Stdin, Stdout, Stderr would all be set to
Wpath. That was the way it worked on the CoCo in Basic09. But when I try that
in C on the MM1, the only path that was being set to Wpath, was Stdout, the
other 2 (Stdin,Stderr), remained set to the original path. So when I did the
Select, I could output to the screen, but I couldn't get any input into Wpath
from the keyboard. If I then Selected the original path, the characters I was
trying to enter into Wpath, were here, on path.
  I have been trying to over come this, but with no luck, so that was why I
finally just set it up to DWEnd the original path then DWSet Wpath.

   Now I'm thinking that the problem is with my system, because I just bought
Write-Right from Joel Hegberg at the Chicago fest, and he has a printer setup
routine that is acting the same way. He opens a small window which contains
various controls to set and enter printer controls into a file, every thing in
the panel is mouse driven, and works fine, but when I try to enter the printer
codes from the keyboard, nothing is placed on the screen. Then when I select
Quit, and the program exits, the numbers that I had entered are there on the
original path.

  So I'm going to go through all the window associated boot modules and see if
this is the problem.

Your modules are fine.  They are data modules that get data written to them,
when that happens the CRC is no longer valid.  It's just the way data modules

Mike,
   Do you have any idea where the module WData is located. Is it merged into
shell ?
   Why I'm asking is, when I do an MDIR, it shows something is corrupting my
modules.
   One of the lines displayed is as follows:

syscall    break      WData        dat00e00000   cls

  When I run mdir into ident using -s -m -z=mlist (mlist is a list of modules)
three modules come up as bad t3, WData, and that dat00e00000.

  t3 is ok when identing the boot file, but I can't find WData anywhere.

 Odds are /t3 comes up bad is that a parameter has been changed with xmode form
it's stock settings. This shouldn't be a problem.

I suspect the same goes for the other two. All three show bad CRC's here as
well.

 /T3 in the startup file.
  As for the other 2, I made a Startup file with nothing in it except iniz h0,
and those modules (WData  dat00e00000), are still there. If I do a Mdir -e it
shows those 2 modules as being Data modules. What I'm trying to figure out is
where they are coming from.

   Do you know if anyone has a master list of the latest editions of all the
boot modules, and their crc values. I'm wondering now if I have an older
version of something thats causing this window Select problem. larry Steve,
  I didn't even think about that, but you are right, I'm am using Xmode on

   Hold everything...  I just tried Joel's printer setup program again and now
it is working. I'll go back and try those window opening test programs and see
if they are working. I don't know why its working now, I did make a new boot

  A couple of lines got chopped off on the last message. You are right, I am
changing /T3 with Xmode in the startup file. What through me there was that the
CRC value in the boot file was good but the crc value in memory was bad, even
though they were the same value. I thought I was looking at memory problems.

Larry: wdata and dat00e0000 are data modules used by the kwindows and the scsii
drivers. They are created by the drivers on startup. They are used for variable
storage, etc. and so will never have a valid CRC. Beware that the OSK xmode
does NOT update the CRC of a module...so if you modify a desc. you'll have to
use something else to update the crc if you want to save the module. Moded,
amoung others, works fine for this. If the ROMs were bad and you had one or
more bad modules, then those modules would not appear in the mdir. I had that
problem with my original ROMs...one of the modules (dir) only showed up in the
mdir some of the time. Probably just a flaky bit in the ROM. My new ROMs don't
have that problem...but I still can't boot from the hard drive (anyone have
anymore help on this?).

Bob,
  Yes, I was going through modules with DED and found the reference to WData
in Windio, so I assumed it was put there for some reason. I couldn't find
that dat00e00000 so I wasn't sure about that one yet.
  Thanks for giving an explanation of what modules put them there.

  So now where do I look to fix the problem I'm having with Select<g>.

  I don't know if you saw that previous message, but I just bought a program
at the fest, and it is suffering from the same problem that I have been
having with trying to use Select. This program that I bought, opens a window,
puts various controls on it, then waits for you to make selections with the
mouse. When one of the selections is made, the program then expects to get
some numbers from the keyboard, well, here the mouse functions fine but none
of the things I enter at the keyboard make it to the program, nothing is
echoed to the screen. After a few minutes of frustration, I do a control-C
to get out of the program, and when I get out, there on the screen are all
the characters that I had typed. For some reason, the Select syscall isn't
duping all three paths when called, it is only duping STDOUT.

  I'm currently using:

Windio  ed #48  crc E50CC0
Keydrv  ed $46  crc 9AAE1D
term    ed #5   crc 1110F3
cio     ed #6   crc E9ADF1

  Do any of these look way out of date ? Oh by the way Syscall #0 crc 50C6B7.

Larry, Here is a segment of code from a game I am working on...It selects a
screen for i/o, etc. Shout if you need more explanations:

 grpnum = getpid();
 path=open("/w",S_IREAD+S_IWRITE);
 if(path<1) dosomething to terminate...
 _gs_opt(path,&optbuf);  ...ya might want more here
 pause=optbuf.sg_pause;  ...to set up the keyboard
 optbuf.sg_pause=0;
 _ss_opt(path,&optbuf);
 KilBuf(path,grpnum,0);
 DWSet(path,0,0,0,80,26,WHITE,BLACK,BLACK);
 ScaleSw(path,0);    /* make sure scaling is on */
 LSet(path,0);
 CurOff(path);
 ...more init stuff ...
 _ss_wset(path,WT_FWIN,&windat);
 BColor(path,BLACK);
 Clear(path);
 Select(path);

I've not run into the 'fuzzy screen' problem. The "more init stuff" apparently
takes the time required (from Mike's message).

Bob,
  I just left Mike a message, trying to explain what I have been running into.
It looks like its a problem with my system, that the Select isn't working like
it should. I'm going to go back through all the window modules and make sure I
have the latest version, and if they are good.

Probably not a problem to keep the mroff name. It appears to do all the latest
mroff I have does, plus more--so it shouldn't confuse things too much. I think
the mroff I have you did too.

Thanks Mike. I got the binary and tried it out. This gives much better
results...but... Well, ya know. I archived the text file I'm trying to print
and have put in your CIS mailbox. It will generate some more errors when you
try to print it. A few of the problems relate to undefined macros; others don't
seem to like a single '.' as a macro argument. Let me know how you make out.

Hey Bob,

I just fixed the problem with the durn tabs and bold+string+endbold+string
stuff.  The unknow command <.> was being caused by trying to bold the word then
following it with a '.'.  The dot was being translated into a \n. so mroff
though it was a command!

Added \f2 to turn on bold and \f1 to turn it back off.  This can be embedded in
the text now.  The last version I sent ya still had a problem with some macros.

I'll put together another upload. <Sigh!>  Sorry it wasn't working the way I
thought it was.

I'm trying to port a program which converts gif files to tif format. I can't
get past the following line:

        FP_OFF(IFD_body) += sizeof(TIF_header);

I assume that FP_OFF is a macro...but I can't find it defined anywhere.
However, I did comment out a #include <dos.h>. So, I assume that FP_OFF is
defined there (perhaps a standard MS_DOS thingie?). Any ideas?

I too have been having IX do my message runs on auto-pilot. Twice a day. First
run at 5:30 am for both Delphi and CIS, then again at 5:30pm for CIS only.

That way, I have all my mail to read over coffee in the morning as well as over
a beer after I get home from the office. Neat stuff. It's solid.

If it has a problem, it tends to error to the conservative and drops connection
fairly rapidly.

It's cut my online time down on Delphi, where I actually stay under the 4
hours/month usage I get with the $10 plan.

Fm: keith bauer 71102,317
To:  Bill Dickhaus 70325,523 (X)

Bill,
    I have gotten InfoXpress to work with cron but it doesn't seem like the
right way to do it. I use SH for my shell. In crontab this is the way I have it
setup:

30 05 * * 1 (setenv TERM vsc;ix -o -l=y -q=2 -c=/h0/ix/work/default)

My question about this is the fact that I have to put the setenv statement in
there. Without this I get an error when running ix saying that the TERM
variable has not been set even thought I do set it from the startup file as
well as .login (I start login from sysgo). Is there another way of doing this
or is this the proper way?

I have only had InfoXpress for 2 days and I can already see that I will be more
active in the forums than I have ever been.

Thanks much Keith Bauer

The problem is that cron isn't passing the environment when it forks the
command line. I discovered this a while back, and then we rediscovered it
during early testing of InfoXpress. I took the cron thats in LIB 12 and fixed
it. I'll clean it up and upload it.

I handle it this way:

Cron calls the following script. The echoes to 'test.log' are left over
debugging statements. There's probabbly a better way to do it, but this has
worked great for me.


setenv TERM vsc chd /dd/usr/steve/ix echo "starting check_mail" >+test.log date

Yup ... it's the OSK way to append to an exisitng file. Converely, >- should
overwrite the contents of an existing file.

I'm running the stock MW shell ... SH, as it is now, has a major security hole
that makes it's use on a dialup system such as mine, unacceptable. I hear tell,
tho, that Carl K. has a rewrite on his list of things to do.
