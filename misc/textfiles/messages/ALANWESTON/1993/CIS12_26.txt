Fm: Martin S. Wayne 73541,45
To: ALL

I MISTAKENLY TOOK OUT A PROGRAM PAK FROM MY MULTIPLEX WITH THE MACHINE ON.  THE
COCO3 RUNS FINE BUT I NO LONGER HAVE A WORKING DISK DRIVE.  THIS IS WRITTEN ON
AN IBM MACHINE.  I THINK MY DISK CONTROLLER HAS BEEN DAMAGED.  ALL THREE LIGHTS
ON MY THREE DRIVES LIGHT UP, BUT I GET NO DIR OR ANYTHING.

Does anyone know where I can get the controller repaired?  I live in
Westchester County New York.

Sorry for the capitals at first.  This is my first try at writing a note in
years.

Thanks for your attention

Ouch!  Dosen't sound good .... but it may be the multipak that's hosed, not the
controller. Have you considered plugging the controller into the CoCo3 to see
if it works? (If this is a real old controller, don't bother. It will need the
MPI for the 12 volts it requires. But if it's  one of the newer, smaller
controllers that only 5 volts, you should be in good shape.

Do the drive lights light up immediately upon power up? If so, is it possible
you've somehow flipped the cable around? This is indicative of having the cable
switched.

That is very strange.  I have a multi-processor Force box at work with one
CPU30 and four CPU33s.  It is up around the clock for perhaps 2.5 years and
hasn't hosed the hard disk ever.  There is a known bug that can waste the root
directory if the disk gets full.  Could that be the problem?

Ed, I haven't heard from him in a while. I'll gove some of my various addresses

You already have the solution to your problem, so I won't belabor that. I would
strongly advise you to always use enough parens to clearly indicate (to the
compiler and anyone who follows your footsteps) your intentions. They don't
affect the code generated (unless it was wrong before) and prevent these sorts
of problems.  The rule is: if in doubt, add more.

Thanks Carl. Yes, using lots of parenthesis is a good idea....

BTW, do you know if your pmem program will run with SSM? I may have an older
copy of it and it gives a 102 or 103 on my SSM system.

I haven't looked lately, but perhaps not.  When I got the 030, I had to go back
through a lot of that stuff and add permit/protect.  I will look and mail a
more current one if I have it.

Hiya, Paul. Sorry, no answers to your questions. Just wanted to welcome you to
the wonderful world of OSK. Have fun.

Oh, for multiple screens (sorry, text only) you might want to look at the
'screen.lha' package in lib 12.

I think I may have found a bug in the 2.3 C realloc() function. What appears to
happen is:

If realloc() fails (ie. returns a NULL ptr) it appears that the original memory
passed is freed! I have some code which looks something like this:

   newbuf=realloc(bufstart, memreq);
   if(!newbuf) ... report no more room error and restart....
   if(newbuf!=bufstart) ...set 'bufstart' etc to newbuf values if buffer moved

However, using SSM any access to memory in the original buffer generates a bus
error. I have verified this with srcdbg.

I have avoided the problem by not using realloc(). Instead I always allocate a
completely new buffer and then copy the old buffer to the new one and free()
the old one. This works...but is wasteful if the original could have been
expanded as realloc() does.

Anyone else had a similar problem?
