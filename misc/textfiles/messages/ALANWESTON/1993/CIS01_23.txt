yep... I still live there.  I look foward to the ann., off the recored, what is
your upgrade policy? also, a suggestion(or two); make the tab key be a tab key.
and if you just hit esc. have a little menu bar with the submenus pop-up... and
make it more colorful... graphical or something... the MM/1 is sapose to be  a
bit of a graphics machine... K.E.G.

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: Ken Gideon 72270,664 (X)

Ken, thanks for the interest in Ved and suggestions...

1. Upgrade policy: Normally we charge a nominal 5 to 10 dollars for an upgrade.
Really just to cover the cost of media, etc. However, with a major change like
from Ved 1.x to 2.0 we do have to charge a bit more. Full details are in the
upgrade announcment in the mail to you.

2. Making tab==tab: Do remember that ALL the keybindings in Ved are user
defineable. This is made much easier with 2.0 since we now include MVEF in the
package. MVEF makes it easy to create a customized environment file with the
key laid out the way you think the should be.

3. Menus: Ved is _not_ a mm/1 editor. It is designed to work on any OSK
platform, and as such does have to assume a somewhat limited environment. The
only thing Ved _really_ needs is cursor positioning. Adding color and stuff is
really quite easy if you want to fool around with the termcap file..nothing
from stopping you from defining 'so' (standout) as red letters on yellow....

4. MM/1: We have included some support for Kwindows. Ved will read a mouse to
get cursor positioning, etc. and does a few things with the Kwindows screen
drivers.

5. A future version of Ved _may_ incorporate a front-end option. As envisioned
a front-end would be a user (or 3rd party) written program which would filter
commands (keys) before they get to Ved. This program could then do it's own
menus, etc. Or it could be a executive in an interactive c-programming
environment. The exec. could transfer control between programs, and even pass
error line numbers to Ved so that the correct line pops up after a unsuccessful
compile. This is still in the planning stage...

To: all

I need to now if I am on the right track here. I got an old XT from work for
free and I want to set it up to use as a mail reader running SLMR. This is what
I think I need to do, please let me know if I am going in the right direction
or not.

I will run a null modem cable from the serial port on the xt to /T1 on my MM/1.
I will run a telcom program on the xt and one on the MM/1. This should allow me
to transfer program via xmodem. I would also like to login to the MM/1. Do do
this do I run tsmon for T1 or do I setup a shell on T1.

Any help would be appreated. Thanks Keith Bauer

Keith,

You're on the right track. You could do either, I run a shell on my CoCo for
access to the CoCo from my MM/1, and I run mtsmon for dialup access to the MM/1
from work.

To run a shell, try: (shell <>>>/t1 &)

You can add any of the shell parameters, like -p=MM1, or -l to require logout
to end the shell, that way you can't accidentally shut that shell down with
ESC.

To run mtsmon, try: (mtsmon -s /t1 &)

In any case, use xmode to set proper baud rate, etc. before starting up the
shell, or mtsmon.

Using either method, you can do file transfers from a terminal program on the
XT via Kermit or Zmodem without running a terminal program on the MM/1 side.
I'm not aware of an OSK xmodem server, but there might be one floating around.
How to do this depends on the terminal program you use on the XT, I do Zmodem
transfers (Kermit too) dialed into my MM/1 from work where I use Crosstalk on a
Dell 386.

Re: xmodem server for OSK. I have a file in my archives called xm19.ar. I
believe I got it here, but not sure if that is the filename (it probably is).
The archive contains source for an interactive xmodem server. I have never
tried it...but it should work.

Bill,

It's in LIB 7 I think.

I grabbed it last night and it seemed to compile ok with a few minor tweaks.

You may want to look for the reference to 'pwd' and change it to 'pd'. It's
somewhere  around the 'log directory' option.

I am trying to write a signal handler using BASIC and syscalls for my mouse.
Have a signal for the mouse to return and the process asleep but cannot manage
F$Icpt and writing the signal to a known memory location. I assume that the
mouse signal is received in one register of the 68070 but which one? And then,
what 68000 assembly language instruction would write that signal value to
memory? I believe if I knew these two things I could accomplish the signal
handler so I am wondering if you know? Really, I am just trying to clone Dale
Puckett's trick that was in Rainbow several years back.

Fm: TED JAEGER 72467,372
To: all

Using KWindows, I have created buttons with shell "display 1e 28 ....". I find
that if the button encroaches on the bottom line of a Type 0 screen on my MM1
the normal gray face of the button takes on the background color of the screen
and its 3d movement is lost. This a bug or am I doing something wrong? Also, I
find that these buttons automatically depress when clicked on with the mouse,
provided that the process is not asleep and the mouse has no signal to return.
Under the latter conditions, no button movement. Again, am I doing something
wrong here?

To: All

Announcing a new product for all MM/1 owners.

The Dirt Cheap Computer Stuff Company, DccS, (me), is pleased to offer a
Floptical Disk Drive.  These drives use 3.5 inch optical disks to read and
write up to 21 Megabytes of data on one disk, while still being able to read
and write standard 1.44 Meg and 720K floppies.

The drives are mounted as a normal 3.5 inch floppy disk drive and connected
using your SCSI cable.  A special device driver and descriptor (/f0) allows you
to access all disk types (21 Meg, 1.44 Meg, 720k) through the same descriptor. 
The drive automatically detects the different types. All disk types are
formatted using special descriptors that can be loaded when needed or included
in your boot file.

Read/write speeds for the 21 Meg disks are much faster than standard floppy
disks.  Measured transfer rates for reading are 124 Kbytes a second and 74
Kbytes a second for writing.  This compares to 15 Kbytes reading and 1.8 Kbytes
writing for a 1.44 meg floppy on the MM/1.  Seek times for the 21 Meg drives
were measured at 137ms average (at the application).

The price for a complete system including the drive, software drivers and
descriptors and documentation for installing and using the drive is $350.00. 
This drive and the software drivers are offered exclusively by DccS.  For more
information, or to place and order contact DccS either by e-mail to me, or
calling or writing the following:
