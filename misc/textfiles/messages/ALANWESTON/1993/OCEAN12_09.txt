Paul,
     Providing John A Donaldson has no objections, send me a 3.5" floppy 
and couple stamps and I will return what I have so far.
     However at present it only works in the Dumb Terminal Mode and the
up/down loading is flakey.  In fact that is what I am using right now
connected to second copy of RiBBS over /t3 at 9600 baud.
     John is continuing work on it and will soon have it able to spawn
or fork out to a bbs and also work in the unattended mode and answer
Fido calls.  At least that is the next release. So maybe you will want
to wait for that.  Strangly enough the compiled 'bink' is 150,934 bytes
but running procs it tells me memsize is 79,500 bytes ???
     What is needed is a BBS program to add to Binkley to handle the mail 
msg's files and allow users to log on and read mail, get files etc.  Now 
is the time to get after Charles West about releasing the source to
RiBBS so we can at least use that for a msg base setup and msg read/post 
and file up/download.  Also need a nodelist processor. And nodediff
parser.
     William Chapple is working on a BBS for the MM/1 and also will be
getting the Binkley port to work with.  I have a C source file for the
Unix BBSCKIT.ARC that I rearchived to .lzh but it is about 10 years old.
     I can archive up the Binkley I have and if you want to download
or get by polling let me know.

 Just a reminder ( for the holiday season )....

   Ed Gressik needs about 9 more people to order the G-Windows Port to the
MM/1, deadline Dec 31st. The initial cost will be 200.00$US. The port will
take about 3 months to complete, as Ed must first BUY an MM/1 of his
own. While it is true that NO development librarys are included in the
initial price, they are going to be ported at the same time. Besides, we
can skin that horse when it stumbles by.

   Frank Hogg is exploreing the possibility of produceing an `expansion` 
card for the Phillips CD-I machine. This card would contain Floppy, Video
and HD circutry. Since the CD-I machine has most or all of OS9 in ROM already
he feels that this would be `one` method to obtain an OSk machine. He`s still
running the numbers, but his gut feeling on cost would be 100-200$.

Hmm.. This jogs a memory of a rumor:  A hack that will allow you to use
BOTH the I/O Board's SIMMS sockets AND the 9Meg Board's sockets.  Will
your hack work that way also?  Since I originally bought my MM/1 for
video interfacing, gobs of memory has its attraction.
Even if you can't use both sets of sockets at the same time, I'm still
interested.  (Now.  Where will I get the money?  Hmm....)  Malcolm

Paul,
     I don't think John objects to others getting this alpha/beta just
so long as they don't complain and object cause it only works as a dumb
terminal so far.  What it does do is give one a feel for how the
binkley.cfg file sets up binkley and the other options it can have.
     I have edited the file and added more readme info so anyone can get 
it working.  I have it available for private download (binkmm1.lzh) and
it is 103,342 byts in size. Let me know if you want to freq it and I
will set up a freq that you can poll and pick up.

Tim,
     If you want the alpha/beta binkley port I can send it.  It will
work on /t0 also.  Send me a 3.5" floppy and a couple stamps and I will
return it to you.  As for the paddle boards for /t3 or /t4 they are in
