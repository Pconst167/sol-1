Robert, funny about screen not working for you. I just set up a couple of
screens and got basic running in both. Loaded some programs and did a dir and
all worked just fine.

 I got one of the MM/1 68340 accelerator boards at the
 Atlanta 'Fest.  Zack Sessions has already posted an
 excellent technical description and review of the upgrade,
 but I thought I would add a couple notes on my own
 experience with the faster system - and a couple more
 "gotcha"s.

        I did not have the "slow" PAL chips on my I/O board, but
 just when I thought I was safe, I discovered some on the
 8-meg memory board.  Replacing them was not as hard as I
 thought it would be, but not a job for someone without
 experience in repairing electronics.  Like a famous coach
 said about passing is a football game -- "Three things can
 happen - two of them are BAD".

        It is, of course, FASTER.  Thats why we bought it.  The
 TeX and PostScript (and Ghostscript) programs I have been
 playing with lately take a lot of time.  Building a new font
 for TeX ran about 15 minutes before, now its about 7.  I
 don't have a "dhrystone" program (or even a whetstone), but
 I can easily see the increase in speed.  I did run the
 little basic "benchmark" program that Frank Hogg posted some
 time ago, and the 68340 came in right about where you would
 expect it.

        It boots from the hard drive.  Twice it has stumbled a
 little on a cold start when it looked for the drive before
 it was up to speed, but it got it on the second try.  Both
 of my hard drives, a 40 meg conner and a 40 meg quantum work
 fine as "/dd".

        Zack said he got a new "shell" -- I didn't.  I have the
 same shell I had before.  Also, "dEd" runs fine - but that
 is probably because of the different shell.  I asked Kevin
 Pease about that new "shell" - he said he didn't know where
 that came from.  Apparently Zack got an accidental "gift"
 from somewhere.

        Windows have a little quirk - changing colors on one
 window does it to all of them.  Kevin Pease has a fix,
 provided by a well known OS9 Guru - he said he would upload
 it very soon.

        I have heard of problems with MM/1's talking to
 printers, especially with long cables, but I was getting
 away with it up to now.  I had ribbon cables from the MM/1
 and a big ugly "386" running to switch boxes, and parallel
 cables from the boxes to the Epson and the Deskjet so I
 could switch either printer to either computer.  --- No
 more.  With the faster CPU, the MM/1 wants a short cable
 directly to the printer.  (I can live with it).

        The reason I haven't said a lot in the forum about my
 new toy is that it had this little problem -- every once in
 a while, especially after a cold start, it would trash the
 hard drive.  It seems there was this little timing problem
 that required some attention from Kevin Pease.  The good
 news here is the response I got on the problem.  I bought
 the upgrade at the "Blackhawk" booth in Atlanta, which was
 manned by Bill Whitman (another IMS rep).  When I decided
 something was wrong, I called Bill (put a message on his
 machine), and left CIS email for Kevin Pease.  BOTH of them
 called me at home within a day.  Both had suggestions and I
 tried them all - but finally had to send the insides of my
 machine to Kevin.  He tracked down the problem, made a new
 PAL to correct it, called to let me know he had it fixed,
 sent it back, and called me again today, just to make sure I
 had it running OK.

        As Delphi and CIS OS9 forum regulars know, response from
 IMS has, in the past, been..  well...  less than
 outstanding.  Paul Ward has not appeared on CIS or Delphi
 for many moons.  ((I think Frank Hogg ran him off.  Frank
 was mean to him.  Look ashamed, Frank.))(GRIN)

        David Graham (Blackhawk) (NIMITZ) has obviously been
 trying to correct the situation.  Although he was not at the
 Atlanta 'fest himself, David left his booth in good hands.
 I am very pleased with the 68340 and the quick technical
 support.

        Like Zack, I feel my money was well spent.  Get one.
 Check with David Graham (NIMITZ) for current price and
 delivery time.

Hmm, was that U18 on the IO board by any chance? Reason I ask was that I
received just today, a replacement PAL for U18, from Bill Wittman. He states in
his letter that "on some systems, not many" require the new PAL to help solve
"hard drive problems". Even though I am not having hard drive problems (unless
you consider not being able to boot from the hard drive as a "problem"), "Pease
highly recommends that you put it in".

And I concur, support from Kevin Pease and Carl Kreider has been excellent.
