Steve (and Dieter)
        I somehow wound up with three different format commands on my system.
The one that works with my `340' is the same one described by Steve in the
previous message. (CRC 4D1A85)

Hello Joe.

You need only to change the device-descriptor for sector-size-change(normally)
and the device-driver will tell the drive this on next 'format'-physically. The
cluster-size(number of sectors/allocation-bit) also set the minimum allocation
per file(sectorsize=512, c=4 --> every file is minimum 2048 by- tes in size)

Carsten,

The archive on cabrales is a perfect example. It contains no documentation at
all, not even a simple README file. All GNU software distributions MUST contain
the minimal FSF declarations. Most GNU distributions include the source,
although I think you're right in that0as long as the source is made available,
its acceptable to distribute only binaries. But in this case (and in the past)
the GCC port for OSK has not usually included the usual FSF README files. I
think Stephan has done an excellent job, but either he isn't paying enough
attention when he puts the distribution archives together, or someone is
repackaging the archives, and not doing it properly.

Bob, have looked over the docs and I/O board, and have decided NOT to attempt to do the Hak myself! I will be using the swap option from
DCCS as soon as I get the cash together for the Simm's and the hak...  I suggest You do the same...

P.S.  Tryed to send You this message last night, but some how I got an error in the message files I uploaded and the computer just stoped,
had to reset to get the system going again...  Hope you get this message...

I think you made the right decision. Mark stepped me though the hack
instructions and my head was spinning!  It's not for the faint at heart. One
false move and you've ruined a multi-level board.
