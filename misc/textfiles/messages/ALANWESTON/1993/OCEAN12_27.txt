 AAARRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!  (Pardon me, I had to let that out.)

Maximus seems to be very popular with Fido SysOps in my area. I have no idea 
why. In my not so humble opinion, dealing with it is not for the faint of 
heart, nor would I recommend Maximus to new SysOps. It's been my experience 
that, in order to do just about anything with it, you have to jump thru all 
sorts of hoops. If there were only two pieces of BBS software to choose from, 
Maximus being one of them, I would probably choose the other, hands down.
 So much for my opinion.

 Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be much choice in the matter. Not many 
BBS programmers feel comfortable in releasing the source code for their 
programs. Those that have done so realize that someone will likely hack it 
apart. This may not necessarily be to the benefit of those who use the
"official" version of the program.
 
 At any rate, if someone works on the Maximus source code, I would hope that 
they would be able to make an easier to use BBS out of it than the author of
Maximus has.

 I wish all good luck with the project.

->       Look for your UPS pkg. by 93/12/17.  I shipped on the 10th.
 
Got it!  It arrived Saturday (the 18th).  I spent all day trying to
match up pages to Table of Contents' ... Well, that and a few other
things..  I seem to be missing one or two title pages, one Table of
Contents, and an index, but they appear to be very minor omissions, so I 
won't sweat it.  Thanks L-O-A-D-S-!-!  (I feel giddy about my computer
again!)   :-)    Malcolm

Malcolm,
       If you can identify which sheets are missing I can try to find
and make copies and send to you.
      I am glad you are happy with your system again, Merry Christmas.

Eric,
      Just what is so hard about Maximus ??, I have heard others comment 
on RiBBS being impossible and even OS9 so what level of difficulty are
we talking about ?  As I see it I doubt that the eventual OSK BBS will
bear much resemblance to any previous system, I would like it to be
RiBBS like, of course, since that has been my experiance.

David,
    The code I modified for my purposes can be found in the Ocean BBS's
file section. The joystick sampling code segments were written by Mike
Haaland and Stephen Seneker (different source files.)
    While on the subject of joysticks, though, even though I've left
this message on Delphi, let me repeat it here. Who's brilliant idea was
it to make the MM/1 joystick port use the old CoCo 6-pin DIN joystcks?
The only joystick I have left has a button that doesn't work, and, as
I'm sure you know, Radio Shack doesn't sell these types of joysticks
anymore. If we want to entice non CoCo people into buying MM/1s, how are 
we gonna supply them with joysticks they can use?
...Eric...
