That's like saying you'll only drive a Toyota in Japan because it was first made

in Japan.  Just because a utilitiy (such as the GNU utilities which I'm sure
you're refering too) was first written on a UNIX system doesn't mean it is
somehow less useful on an OS-9 box.

The GNU utilities are being ported to OS-9 because they are very good and freely

available.  In a previous message, you asked if AR can be ported to UNIX (which
is already has).  Wouldn't you say, judging from your logic, that it would be
'bad form' to run an OS-9 utility on a UNIX box?

There are many advantages to OSK over UNIX.  Believe me, I am the system
administrator for several UNIX machines.  If there were an equal number of
applications for OS-9 as there are for MSDOS or UNIX, I believe OS-9 would be
the major operating system of the world.

I am not saying that it is "bad form" to run GNU utils and programs under OSk, I

am just saying that, for me, since I already have a UNIX system, at this point
OS-9/68k application wise, still isnt enough incentive to spring for an OSk
machine..As for AR running under UNIX, no, I am talking about applications
mostly here, Unix AR, and the DOS AR, and the OSk AR, just lets people share
info a little easier, what I am saying is, that right now, OSk, application wise

doesnt hold any advantage (for me) over UNIX, so why switch? esp when most of
the OSk programming utils ARE GNU stuff (Which I already have under UNIX).
Hopefully, (and by looking at the UG's perpective I think there will) one day be

more incentive for me to by an OSk box. When/If I do, I would use the GNU utils
like everyone else, I am simply saying, right now, OSk doesnt have enough to
make me switch.. granted, if I wont the lottery (which would be hard, since I
dont play) I would buy an OSk machine in a snap, I would probably buy all 3
major systems (MM/1,Sys 5,Kix/30) but until I have 35 million $$, I have to
think about my wallet..

Think of it this may Mark, if you REALLY wanted/needed to run Wordperfect and
you didnt have a computer (of any sort) would you buy a UNIX box to run it, or a

PC? (considering the price of a UNIX system vs a PC, and a copy of Wordperfect
DOS/Windows vs a Unix version) Thinking with your wallet, I am sure you would
take a PC with DOS. Esp when there are more apps for DOS. I myself, cant stand
DOS, so, I took the next-best thing, application wise, UNIX.

From a application users viewpoint, no, there isn't any reason to run an OSK
system.  There just arn't enough applications out there to justify it. I'm not
arguing that point.  However, from a programmers perspective, especially if you
are writing device drivers, or low-level-to-the-hareware utilities, OS-9 shines.

It all depends upon your needs.

We are trying to get more applications for OS-9 to be written, but it is
difficult to get people to do things.  It's the old Catch-22, no one whats to
write good applications because they say they can't sell enough to make it worth

their while, and there arn't enough people using OS-9 because there arn't enough

applications.  (Sigh)

agreed, from a programmers perpective, OS-9 is the best, hands down. I do do
some programming, but I would really rather plunk down some $$ for a program and

do what I need to do, now, than write it, and wait a few months do actually DO
what it is I need to get done. So, I really dont need GNU stuff under OS-9 (Osk)

I need apps. When those apps become available (on either OS-9 or OS-9000
platforms) I will but a machine. (and hopefully someday there will be enough
apps) OS-9000/PowerPC would be the only one I would "throw caution into the
wind" on. Simple because it would be such a GREAT system the I would be willing
to write programs more for it, and because PowerOPEN would still be there to
back me up when I really need access to an app that runs under DOS,or Windows,
or even Unix.

I believe B09 has the modulus (MOD) function, so it should be rather
easy to write such a routine.  It would be something like:

(* decimal to octal *)
(* Note that a value MUST be place in decimal... probably should use
(* a parameter... the contents of decimal gets destroyed...
(* output will be placed in octal$
dim decimal,digit,t:integer
dim octalrev$,octal$:string

octal$=""
octalrev$=""
while (decimal>0) do
  digit=MOD(decimal,8)
  octalrev$=octalrev$+str$(digit)
  decimal=decimal/8
endwhile
(* Now we have octal number in octalrev$, but it's in reverse order...*)
(* So, invert it so it's correct in octal$ *)
for t=len(octalrev$) to 1 step -1
  octal$=octal$+mid$(octalrev$,t,1)
next t
print octal$
END


(* Procedure to go from octal to decimal...  octal$ should contain
(* the octal number string.  decimal will contain the decimal value when
(* finished.  Again, params should be used.
dim octal$:string
dim decimal,t:integer

decimal=0
for t=1 to len(octal$)
  decimal=decimal+val(mid$(octal$,t,1))*(8**(len(octal$)-t))
next t
print decimal
END

Hope that helps!

 It's been a while so I'm not sure of the syntax for B09 anymore but try
 something like:

 define string:str
 define integer:cntr,value
 define byte:khar

 cntr=0;
 value=0;
 while(str[cntr]<>255)
     char=str[cntr]-48
     exitif
         (char > 7)
     endexit
     value=value*8
     value=value+khar
     cntr=cntr+1;
 endwhile

 The above assumes that BYTE variables are unsigned.  If not then you'll also
 have to check for 'khar < 0'.  The expression 'value*8' can be replace with
 a 3 bit logical left shift if B09 has any such command

     B&B Disk woes
     From: MROWEN01     To: ALL


    I have a Coco3 / 512k with a B&B hard disk interface. I recently moved my
machine which is repackaged in a PC case, and when I set
    it back up, I couldn't access the disk. I tried to reboot and an
    attempt is made to read the startup file but it bombs. The shell
    comes up from the floppy. I could chd to /h0, but the directory
    was garbled. Some directorys would cause the drive to run forever
    when I tried moveing to them. Since it appeared data was garbled,
    I thought "no sweat, I'll do a recover from backup". I did a format
    of /H0 and that seemed to go fine, but after the format I can't chd
    to /h0 at all.

    I also re-seated the drive card and checked the interface, but nothing
    helps. Doe anyone have any idea? I don't know whether to suspect the troller

card. There isn't much to the B&B card
    itself, but I guess it could be fried as well. The Coco works fine and
    so do the floppy drives under both OS/9 and RS-DOS, it's just the har
    drive that won't work properly.

Glad to hear you like PLAYSOUND.  I spent about 6 months developing it because
as I was making it I was also learning BASIC09.  For every problem I ran into I
had to fiure out what commands might help, then learn how to use them and
finally de-bug the overall program.  By the time it reached the version here I
was both pleased with it and pleased to be done with it.
     This program goes great with the 2 Meg memory...really flies.

Just hoppin in and responding to the query about setting echo/no echo. Yes, that

can be done without tmode but you have to write a little BASIC program that uses

syscall to changes values in the path desriptor. I have done that and include a
module called tmd (miniature tmode) in a prgram that I hope to have ready to
release shortly. I will share the tmd source if ya like. Just have to go find
it. It can be used to turn echo and pausing on and off as well as disable the
END/BREAK key. Does this from within A BASIC program without having to fork a

     From: RANDYKWILSON To: NICKJOHNSON

Nick, as Ted said, turning on/off echo, or anything else tmode does, can be done

from basic via the SysCall command. I attempt to upload the following last
night, but Delphi/Sprint took a mini vacation in the middle. It's a totally
useless program that turns off echo, writes to the screen, reads chars from the
keyboard, and on getting a <cr> puts the "tmode" back to as it was, and exits.
While the overhead of setting up Syscall may appear great, it is really useful.
You can use it to access *any* os9 user state system call. You can do your own
error trapping without having to worry about what B09 will do in a given
situation. ANd most important, you can do such nice things as putting the
terminal back into the "tmode" state it was in. NO hardcoded echo/pause on/off
at exit. Just put the original opts back.

     RE: Latest Basic Trouble (Re: Msg 82229)
     From: THETAURUS    To: ILLUSIONIST

        Thanks for the tip Mike. I'm gonna try that as well as some other
   looping structures. I still can't figure out why the current
   while/endwhile loop isn't working. So far my only option is to use the
   error trap, which functionally is fine and it does get the job done,
   but since the sole purpose of this program is to learn how to do
   things right, and in the end make sure it is as efficient and tight as
   possible. This is why I am hoping to get it accomplished with a loop
   waiting for EOF. For some reason it simply isn't reading the EOF, as
   if the actual escaping action<Ctrl-Break> takes precedence to what is
   waiting for it, so it doesn't even get read unless there is an error
   trap in there. Also, the code you sent me looks pretty informative.
   I'm gonna try working on it tomorrow, since I have the day off from
   work<the first Sunday off in ages!<G>, and I'll see if I can work
   parts of your code into mine. If I get anything significant done, I'll
   post here letting you know, and possibly showing the code. I looked it
   over several times and am beginning to understand the flow of the
   program<I don't have a book to read right now besides OS9 stuff, so I
   just look over source code when going to bed ;-) >. Also, I noticed
   when skimming over my batch of messages earlier, that Randy had an
   interesting reply regarding your code so I'll see what's up with that,
   and whatever else is new in this thread<which I will download after
   posting this>. Thanks again, and I'll see what I can make out of all
   that!

        I was wondering why you were doing that in your code. Can you
   expand on that? I don't quite understand why it has to be converted,
   and how does it relate to the variable? Is it so that low level<byte

because, the code itself looks at the filename it got from the disk, and the
name(s) you gave it. if the name$ you gave it, and the filename from the disk
are the same, it DOESNT delete the filename, and goes to the next file in the
dir. now, if you typed in say, "JUNK.file" and the actual filename is
"junk.FILE" (note the caps) to OS-9, it doesnt matter, to Basic09 "JUNK.file"
doesnt equal "junk.FILE". and because it DOESNT equal the program deletes the
filename (assuming that, it isnt the file you specified, it has no way of know
the junk.FILE and JUNK.file" are REALLY the same, unless you capitalize
both..see?

     X-Pad under OS-9
     From: BOISY        To: ALL

I picked up an X-Pad the other day and began to play with it.

This thing is really neat!  I hooked it up to my Multi-Pak on my CoCo 3, typed
in a BASIC program that was in the X-Pad manual, and saw it work.

Well, I've started writing a driver for it under OS-9.  My question is two-fold:

(1) Has anyone already developed a driver for the X-Pad under OS-9 Level II, and

(2) If not, would anyone be interested in such a thing?

Since the X-Pad is not interrupt-driven, I've opted to use the GetStat call to
gather information about the pen position and status.  If anyone is interested,
I'll upload it when I'm finished along with sample code on how to access it, and

a C binding.

Great, I've had one of those things in my ditty box for what will be 6-7 years

long!  But I've also looked into increasing its resolution which would be
hardware hacking. Tel ya what, do the software, but don't liimit it to coco2
resolutions, and I'll see what I can hack up in hardware to make it 320-640 but
192-200 or so.  Cheers, Gene

I've ran into a slight problem with the X-Pad -- it won't work under 2MHz.  If I

slow down OS-9 Level II to .89MHz, the values can be read fine.  I verified this

under RS-DOS with the same results.

So before it can be usable under OS-9 Level 2, the hardware glitch will have to
be addressed.  Perhaps you could do that Gene?

Those XPADS were amazing things!  My school had a network of CoCo's and
also had an X-Pad and I could barely believe my eyes when I saw what it
could do... even detect if the pen was floating above the board.  I had
lots of great fun with it and always wondered why they didn't become
more popular.

Hi, Boisy -

My main CC3 disk controller for several years was one of the old (1981?) 12V
types that couldn't handle 1.79 MHz.  When Rogue first came out (yeah! our first

taste of Level 2 on the CC3!) it wouldn't boot until I patched the hi-speed
switch out of the kernal.  I modified CC3Disk to slow the clock on entry, and
restore on exit, and ran this way permanently.  (Didn't even really slow things
down much, since CC3Disk spends most of its time halted anyways, and it doesn't
matter if you are halted at .895 MHz or 1.79 MHz...)

The only glitch I ran into is when I installed the DISTO 1-Meg upgrade, cosmetic

thing, though (due to the timing) -- never any problems resulting from this.

You may be able to do the same within your X-Pad driver.

Cheers... / Ken

This is Jim Vestal, using my friend's account.  When I had my old x-pad I write
a small basic09 program that did the same peeks that the disk basic program,
unfornately the source along with all my old source have been lost to a hard
drive crash several years ago.  I have since sold my xpad but may be getting
another one soon.  By the way I had my xpad back in 1984-85 long before the CoCo

3 and level 2 was released.  I wrote the basic09 program under Level 1.

I heard that the xpad's controllor does not work under the 2 Mhz speed of the
CoCo 3.  It will work at 1 mhz though.  I hope that this report was wrong.

Yes, I would be interested in getting the OS-9 Level 2 drivers for the xpad.
Even if it works only at Mhz your driver can slow the computer down to read the
xpad and speed it back up afterwards.

Don't hold your breath just yet on that, I'm going to get rz/sz working first.
But thanks for the tip. I haven't looked at mine in about 4 years, but I don't
seem to recall it was cpu speed sensitive. I also don't recall if I checked it
at 1.79 mhz either, so it could well be. However, if you see a new rzsz here and

then don't hear from me about it, tickle my mailbox with a 1/4 stick or so. Mine

does work, and the efforts I put into it at the time were in the line of
attempting to generate an accurate schematic so I could see what needed to be
done to get at least coco3 accuracy and ranges out of it. I may even have to
re-address that puppy now, I think I've got 4 bytes open between $FF40 and
$FF7F! 2 232 packs, one with an extra set of chips for the mouse, the
supercontroller II, and a WP-RS have eaten up most of the available I/O space
here.  Hang in there tho, I'll get to it eventually. Cheers, Gene

They should have a BASIC program in the manual, if you have that.
If you don't have the manual, perhaps BOISY can post the memory
locations for the X- and Y- coordinate registers, plus the memory
location for the pen-control (pen-up/down, etc).
I would like to get one.

It's a generic useing the Rockwell chip set.   No problems with IBM type boards
whatsoever.   No problem with direct logons at 2400 via Tymenet either. but I
think the problem is that Delphi won't accept the call. (It seems that the
Sprint 1-800 node then makes a collect call to your service, and Delphi doesn't
accept them.)   I finally got it clear by going to 7-O-1  (strange settings to

You're correct.. AIX (IBM's port of UNIX) is shippping, but it also uses Power
Open, so will run any UNIX program (at least in theory!). A DOS emulator and

yes, but HOW will they support it is what I am wondering, will it be just a port

well..I am just wondering if it will be in a real position equal to or maybe
even above PowerOPEN. OS-9000 will never have the apps that Unix,DOS,Windows and

the Mac have seperatly, let alone together. The best strategy would be to get at

least the more popular apps from each system running under OS-9000 (like with
DOS/Windows under VPC)..if OS-9000/PowerPC supported just DOS/Windows apps,
WELL, I would probably erase PowerOPEN from the HD..

I would imagine they will port OS-9000 over, since it is all in C anyway. Simply

run the source through a compiler and have a "native mode" OS-9000... which
should run exceptionally FAST! You wouldn't NEED any emulators! Just run OS-9000

With the current evaluation system, there is no reason OS-9000, since it is in
C, couldn't easily be ported to native PowerPC code. I'm not sure exactly how it

would run. One of the operating systems (PowerOpen, OS-9000, AIX, etc. ) would
have to be runnin g first, then launch the other in a window, I would imagine.
The only experience I have with multi operating systems on the same machine is
the CoCo.. DECB and OS-9, of course! It just seems to reason that SOMETHING has
to be in charge FIRST! Of course you
 could always re-boot from a different drive partition, which would be less
efficient than running one from a window of another (operating system, that is).

That is why I was saying there might have to be an emulator to run under say,
under PowerOPEN, and run the OS-9000 emulator, or maybe, Microware will devise a

way to run PowerOPEN under OS-9000. That would be best, BUT, consider this, how
would multi-tasking work? I mean, running DOS as a task is no big deal. But what

about unix, how would Unix multitask? would the Unix tasks grab full
time-slices, there by "cheating" os-9000, or just grab slices of Unix's time
slice (which would slow unix to a crawl, I bet) very trickey. I wouldnt want to
be the guy in charge of figuring that one out. :)

Though it doesn't have any source listings :-) and its age is starting to show
(nothing on LUCIFER, DES, public-key cryptosystems, etc.), the canonical
reference on classical cryptography is David Kahn's *The Codebreakers*. There's
a journal, *Cryptologia*, that would be worth your while.  I've seen a book in
the stores on encryption that might have some source code (I haven't looked
inside; guess I ought to).

Recently the government has at least tried to keep some folks, among which was
/is the Austin Code Works, so I presume source code was available, from
distributing a package called PGP, Pretty Good Privacy.  I believe it's a
public-key cryptosystem.  There *may* still be places where it can be found.

     Parallel Port
     From: WTHOMPSON    To: ALL

Does anyone know if any of the parallel ports available for the coco is
bidirectional?  There is a new product out for PC clones (portables mainly)
that is a Sound Blaster type sound board but hooks to a parallel port.  I'm not
sure if a bidirectional port is needed but I would think so. This seems like a
decent way to add quality sound to our cocos.
  I have seen the sound board in Computer Shopper and I also just got a catalog
from Tiger software and the have some info about it.  It is called the
Audioport.  It is billed as multimedia sound for your laptop.  It plugs into the

parallel port and gives microphone input, audio output via builtin speaker or
external amp/headphones, and multi-timbral FM sysnthesis. It also is AC/DC
powered.  It retails for around $70.
  Has anyone else seen this product?  I'm just fishing for ideas so lets hear
them!

drivers could be written for it, I am sure it would go over pretty good with

set for it..alas, no info and no compiler for the coco.. :(. if you could get
ahold of more info in err, on it, I am sure someone could say if it is likely to

get written. BTW. A new CC3IO would be needed, to treat this new device as the
main audio out- (unless we kept the "real" coco audio, and just had external
programs access the high quality sound)

would be better to re-write cc3io though, split it up, audio in one driver video

Hi, Wayne.  Reading from my J&M floppy controller's manual, it indicates that

lines are bi-directional.

Some PC's have output-only parallel ports, so I doubt the Audioport requires a
bi-directional parallel port. Many parallel-port devices for the PC that do both

input and output will configure themselves to work with either type.

So how do they do inp if the port is "output only". Well, actually, all PC
parallel ports have a few input lines...although in normal use they are used for

various inputs for handshaking, paper out warning, etc. Unless the CoCo parallel

port also had all these, you might run into problems writing software to utilize

items such as the Audioport.

I agree that a split cc3io would be best.  Also more info IS needed about this
thing before too much progress can be made.  If this Audioport is soundblaster
compatible there are TONS of sound files out in the MSDOS world and it seems
like a program could be written to have the coco play these files through the
Audioport.  Kinda like the MIDI programs.  In fact this thing could be kind of a

step in between the coco and full MIDI sound and have the potential to be more
useful than MIDI (ie. w/split cc3io).

Get in touch with RICKULAND here and tell HIM you would be willing to try
writing a bi-directional driver for the CCIO, and you can probably get all the
info on it you could hope for!

And on waiting for Power PC prices to drop... I hope you don't plan on buying
another computer for 3-4 years! Unless these things get really competitive with
Intel's Pentium and a price war ensues, I don't think they will be very low for
a while. Probably in the superfast 486 and Pentium machine range, though they
can theoretically be built cheaper than Pentium machines due to lower pricing.
Builders will use the high Pentium prices to get more profit, at least at first.

Only if sales aren't what they7d lik 'd like will they exploit there lower
initial cost by dropping prices below Pentium machines. I'm like you in a way, I

think the market is ripe for a multi operating system machine, one that runs the

three main OSs out there... DOS, Windows, and System 7 ( Mac)... all on the same

hardware with respectable performance. Just think how Level II would run on a

Frank, since I wrote the drivers for the Conect CoCoIO board, let me make a semi

official statement here. After much thinking on the matter, Rick and I could not

come up with a single application for a "generic" bi-directional parallel port
driver. Indeed, with the speed potential of the serial ports, we felt that the
only use for the para port was as a printer port. However, I have made it clear
to Rick that if a useful application developed that required a speciallized
bi-directional driver, I would write it. This sound card appears to have just
that potential. I'm awaiting more information.

depending on how the soundblaster files are implemented, a list xxx > /snd (if
/snd is the descriptor for the audioport) could be done..maybe a special "list"
command would be needed, merge xx > /snd or copy xxx /snd might work
too..depending again, on how the files were implemented, I think there is a set
of drivers to just list a file to the speech sound pak and the file will be
"read aloud". pretty neat..

Do you think "standard" OS-9 audio could be made to play through this port? I
mean, how easy do you think it would be to let a "display 7" to play over the
port? or get game audio played through? Some sorta "conversion" would have to be

made, I think, might not be worth it. Just have the "new" apps use the stereo
port, like a .MOD file player.

Either way, a driver like that would be great! Gives me a good reasion to get 2
CoCoIOs, serial mouse, 2 terminals, modem, printer and audioport!

I will also see what I can turn up on this audioport..

On those PowerPC prices, It's not just the Pentium machines they'll be in
competition with.  There'll be each other, too.  Apple will probably be the next

mfr. to get one out, but as soon as Compaq or Northgate get one built, look out.

At least, I hope it'll go that way.  I _really_ don't want to have to settle on
a 486 or pentium with all these new possibilities out there.  I wonder which

Right, but that's just the price of the chip itself to manufacturers in lots of
1000. The machines will be priced relative to value and performance. Since they
perform equal or better than a Pentium, vendors will price them that high at
least at first. The y'll just make a little more on them!!

What I know about Apples wouldn't even fill my dumb cat's head, but I do know
that they use a bus architecture called NuBus.  I'm sure it's smarter than ISA,
though.  Knowing Apple, it probably has some very interesting features that
noone but Apple knows about.  I would worry about device drivers and such,

stuff I'm getting ready to upload). Yeah, MetaFont is a frightfully slow way to
create fonts, but at least you only have to do it once!  DviPS runs pretty fast
after the fonts are built.

     BTW, if you're interested, I think I've figured out why TeX takes so long
to start up.  When I compiled it, I set up defaults for the TEXINPUTS_SUBDIR and

TEXFONTS_SUBDIR paths. TEXINPUTS_SUBDIR is an environment variable which TeX
uses to set up it's search paths.  It expands each directory in TEXINPUTS_SUBDIR

into a list of all subdirectories of the named directories.  In the version I
uploaded, TEXINPUTS_SUBDIR defaults to /dd/sys/tex/inputs, and TEXFONTS_SUBDIR
defaults to /dd/sys/tex/fonts.  If you define those two environment variables to

empty, and define TEXINPUTS and TEXFONTS to a colon-separated list of the actual

directories, it should start up faster, since the code to generate the
subdirectories is really slow.

P.S.  Did you compile in the DigiFax driver in the new GhostScript upload?

Nuts! .. Sorry about that -- one of the dangers of uploading stuff that I am not

able to test.  I think I put all the driver sources in one archive ... if you
want to take a shot at it.  One of the things I did in de-bugging some drivers
was to operate on the output file with "beav" (it does global changes to a
binary file) - if you can tell me which codes to change, I'll do it.

I got a copy from you at the Fest, and I can't get anything to work correctly.
The screen driver does nothing but show a window and then when you exit it, it
locks the whole machine.  I also couldn't get it to convert a file by specifying

an output device and then a file to write to.  I forget what happened, but I
think I cane up with a memory error.

On running Ghostscript -- back on the original window you started it from (not
the display window it opens) does it guve you any error messages? If it can/t
find what it wants, it generally complains. Also beware - running the tiger.ps
or golfer.ps demo with the default kwindows driver and kwindows ver 48 is a
guaranteed crash. For the graphics demos either put -sDEVICE=kwlo in the command

line, or boot with kwindows ver 38.  It does use a lot of memory - watch what
else is running. Oh Yeah, if you had a previous version running -- note that the

init files are different for version 2.6.1 - it will grouch at you if it finds
the old "gs_init.ps", but the other files might confuse it.

  Helper wanted to prepare Colorful Sled ED6 for Delphi.

I have realized that I will not have the time to prepare the doc's for my
version of SLED due to other commitments for quite some time. So that it will be

available sooner, I am asking for someone to accept the parts, send out copies
for beta testing and prepare the docs and the distribution package. I will fix
if I can any catastrophic bugs of course.

Colorful Sled ED6 has been unchanged since a minor bug fix done in February
1991. Most of the bugs in the original version, which was pulled from this data
base, have been fixed and new features added.

Some of the new features include easy full screen editing and running Basic09
programs, 105 columns possible on graphics screens, macros (No Load/Save) and
selected text lines to be moved/deleted/written out are displayed in a different

color.

Other than starting from similar original programs, this version has no relation

to other versions in this forum.

If you are willing to help, please sent me a message.

I may be slow to reply so don't worry if I don't respond quickly. All I can say
is that sometime within each month I will use my 4 hours.

I'm not that familiar with installing Shell+, but use it all the time. But I
installed it myself, or rather the CoCo did it itself. Yes, this is a product
plug, I'm sorry!! I sell a disk set with all the major patches, including Shell
+, for $7.50 +$2.50 S& H.. throw in a desktop quick reference for OS-9 for $12
+$2.50. Anyway, the program auto installs all the patches provided you have a
512K system with a minimum of two 40T/DS drives. 80 track 3.5 or 5.25 drives are

fine, as long as you can copy the 40T/DS disks to them. If you have only one
40T/DS drive, you can set a I'll make up a patched disk for you, but I need a
full description of your system, as some of the patches work with real-time
clocks, the MPI, etc. The program asks if you have these, also Multi-Vue. You
then edit the boot list and OS9GEN a new bootdisk fr om the patched disk. I'll
send you the two disk set plus the patched disk for $2 more to cover the extra
disk and a buck for the time. I will need a copy of your OS-9 and Multi-Vue
disks to verify you own Level II... but not the originals. All I want to do
 is verify you have the program, where you got it is none of my immediate
concern (in my opinion).

Hi Mike--I think one way would be to get modbuster or a similar program here on
the database. Then use it to explode the shell file you now have on your boot
disk. Then delete the shell module that comes out of the exploded file and then
merge shell+ with all the other files that are left. The command would be
something like--merge shell dir copy etc. etc.> shellfile. Then delete shell.
Then rename shellfile shell. Then attr shell e w r. This creates an executable
shell. Then delete the shell in your CMDS directory on your boot disk. Then copy

the new shell into the CMDS on your boot disk. BTW before you do any of this,
backup your boot disk. If you have any problems, get back to us. <Phil>

I'm not sure what you mean about the SAVE command. There is a new SAVE in the

problems. When you copy to the 80 tracks, just copy each of the 5.25" disks to
its own 3.5 to avoid a ny confusion!

Yeah, I started some nice gfx routines tonight, I am not going as "in-depth" as

cols/rows to set up an overlay in, pretty neat way to do "pop up" windows (Zoom
up??) I am trying to think of other things to do, I will REALLY work on the Gfx
stuff after I get a set of ANSI Basic subroutines finished, I really want to try

and bridge the gap a little between ANSI Basic and Basic09 (from what I have
heard, ANSI Basic give REALLY powerful string manipulation). I also have the DES

You mean kinda like the Mac does?  I did that in one of my MM/1 programs
and it worked out fantastic... it is a really nice effect.  I'm assuming
you're using XOR logic to draw the BOXes on the screen and then
redrawing them so they are erased?  If you'd like to see my source code,
I'll send it to you email.

ANSI BASIC?!  What year did the ANSI council define BASIC?  There is ANSI
FORTRAN, ANSI COBOL, ANSI C, ANSI FORTH, ISO PASCAL.  I don't know about ADA,

I forget the exact year, it was '86-'87ish, I read a book on advanced BASIC (
structured) routines, it mentioned ANSI Basic, in fact the line was something
like this: "This book conforms to the ANSI Basic standard (didnt know there was
an ANSI specification for BASIC did you?)."...in a book I read on TRUE Basic,
the introduction said that future versions on True Basic (this was an OLD book)
would conform to the ANSI standard, which was then just being finshished up, I
guess, the (c) on the book was '86. I can check all this out for ya if you want,

I might even be able to get the document # for the ANSI specs (which would be
good, since not to many people know of ANSI basic. and since I want to write
ANSI subroutines....)

Nice idea on using OWSET and GETBLK to restore the screen, Zack!

Ok! Thanks, I will get right on it, shouldnt be to hard actually..will add it in

as part of the 3rd archive of basic subroutines. It should work fine with basic
68k as well, actually all my subroutines should. So far, the 3rd archive
contains "usable" versions of popular sort routines (I have done
bubble,ripple,shell and insertion sorts) Shell sort SHOULD be the fastest, but
it isnt, even on large arrays..I dont know why, I even found actual basic source

in an old book in the colleges library, typed it in EXACT, but changed "dim's"
to params and ran it, still slower..the book said that SHELL sort was faster
than bubble, but I havent been able to get it to work..so I might not include
shell sort, until I can get it to work (as it SHOULD) or someone tells me that
shell sort isnt fastest.. my results are like this:

(all ran on the same array)

bubble: 14 secs
ripple: 14 secs
shell : 53 secs
insertion : 3.2

So, I have mostly been working with insertion (obviously :) )

Neat! I decided to write them mostly because of the truely PATHETIC amount of
subroutines for Basic09, although, at this point, I think it is filling up
rather quickly. I want to get at least 30 or so more out there, before sitting
back and using em for anything serious :). 1 thing I am going to do is start
writing some apps for terminals. I dont mean routines to control terminals, I
mean actual programs. I hope someone out there with a C compiler will eventually

modify the uEmacs programs we have for the coco to use the "termset" file by
Microware, or termcap. either 1 is fine. I hate hardcoded controls! A patch to
dynacalc to use a command line option for the coco or another terminal (since we

have a vt100 .trm file!) that would be nice. To bad I dont do asm. :(. We have
Scred for terminals, so I am not going to bother with an editor just yet. we
have Dynacalc so a spread sheet isnt needed. Maybe I will mess with a text based

"gui" for terminals. Actually, it would just be a REALLY advanced menuing
system. Just for kicks once I wrote a program that tested the current mouse pos
and displayed the TERMINALs cursor in relation to the mouse. It was pretty neat.

Just like doing for the coco really. Just use vt100 "curxy" codes rather than
coco. But that kinda defeated the e coco and terminal) I just used the left
joystick port for the terminals mouse, and the right port for the coco. I had
true "ss.mouse" calls go to the right port, and used simple "joystk" calls from
gfx to get the left port for the terminal. It was more of a novelty than
anything. I never wrote any apps to really take advantage of it. But the
capability is there!!

The modem you have is probably a point-to-point modem, not a dial-up model. In
order to use it you have to have a dedicated phone line between a pair of them.
We use similar modems around here on the mini-computer I'm assistant
adminstrator on. Will check the model number with a couple of ours to make sure.

If it has a SIX WIRE phone jack instead of a FOUR WIRE, it most likely is though

(a point-to-point).

I checked, and all our point-to-point modems are newer Codex (by Motorolaa Data

     Reading from Multiple Inputs
     From: MREGC        To: ALL

    Maybe someone here can help save the little remaining hair that I haven't
pulled out yet. :)
    I'm trying to set up a process which uses two windows for display and
constantly switches back and forth between them. I need to know exactly when a
key is pressed while displaying either window, and to know which window was
being displayed when the key was pressed.
    I though that the way to do this would be to set up an interrupt with
_ss_ssig on both window paths, so that when I got an interrupt matching one of
the 2 which I'd set up, I could just issue a read call to that window's
keyboard. However, in practice, its working out nothing like that.
    I believe the problem here is that I understand little to nothing about
setting up and processing interrupts correctly, any enlightenment anyone could
provide would be greatly appreciated.

Eric,

    I think this should help you out with your signals.  Below is some C
source code which opens up two new windows and writes "Window #1" and
"Window #2" in each, respectively.  (You'll have to use F9 or F10 to
flip and find the screens.)  You can then type in either window, and
what you type is echoed back to the same window (you will actually see 2
copies of the character you typed, since this program doesn't turn the
standard tmode echo off).  To exit, just type a capital 'Q' in either
'Window #1' or 'Window #2'... the program will tell you which window you
hit 'Q' in to exit the program.  Let me know if you need anything more.

Thanks, Joel.
    Actually, this looks exactly like what I'm already doing. Which leads me to
question if its possibly something else causing my problem. For instance, could
the fact that I'm switching screens so rapidly cause a problem with trapping the

keypress? I dunno, but I'm running out of guesses so I'm grasping at straws.

That could be the problem.  I know that sometimes K-Windows can do stuff
like that.  In fact, when I flip screens with 'f9' or 'f10' keys,
occasionally the palettes will flip but the screen will not.  If I press
'f9' again, the screen after the unshown screen appears, so I know
K-Windows was actually thinking the screen was being shown.  Rarely
happens though.  Perhaps when it puts up one of your screens, for some
reason kwin doesn't track it correctly and is still taking keyboard
input from the other window.  I'm not sure what else to say about it,
but I would not rule out a kwin bug.

Actually, I believe I've found the problem, and though it does have to do with
the quickness of window switching, its the exact opposite of what I thought.
When I got a keypress I would jump to the interrupt handler, set a flag, finish
writing the new screen data and display it before processing the key. It
*appears* as though switching to the new screen happened so fast that the
keypress was caught on both inputs, and the program had a problem trying to
handle both interrupts. I changed the program to accomodate this, yet it still
seems to be processing the intrrupt twice, but whether from the same screen or
one from each screen I'm not sure yet.Oh well, at least its a starting point for

further investigation.

     NitroOS9 Review
     From: MARKGRIFFITH To: ALL

I need a volunteer to do a complete review of the latest version of NitrOS9
(Ver.  1.15).  The ideal person should NOT already have a copy if NitrOS9
installed, but should be a user with enough experience to install and use this
package while taking notes along the way to write the review.  Also, this person

should be able to write decently.  No Hemmingways are expected, just be able to
put your thoughts on paper to where it can be edited for clarity and
correctness.  You don't need to be an English major to do this (grin).

Whomever gets to do this gets to keep the NitrOS9 package as their fee for doing

the review.  Consequently, we expect a decent amount of time to be spent on this

and a good, accurate and unbiased review to be made. I'd like to include the
review in the December or January issue of Metamorphosis, so please make sure
you also have the time required to do this.

All volunteers please e-mail me your requests and your system particulars.
Thanks!

     CRTs
     From: MROWEN01     To: ALL

I've worked with hardware for a long time, but I have limited experience with
CRTs. I dabbled with television about 15 years ago, but I don't remember
everything. How can I determine when a CRT is safe to handle. Is there an
approved method of discharging a CRT? I need to work with some black and white
monitors and I would hate to get burned. Flyback transformers and high voltage
are not my favorite things to work with! Anyone's input would be appreciated.

     RE: CRTs (Re: Msg 82472)
     From: JES68K       To: MROWEN01

Mike,
    I work for a manufacturer of ultra high resolution monitors (2560x2048) and
waking up on a sleepy monday morning by being zapped with 25K+ volts is an
experience you only need once to remember what to do and not to do!
    The real danger is located at the Anode Cap of the CRT: this is the
connection on the rear sloping area leading to the long slim neck for the CRT.
If you come in contact with this area (even with the monitor turned off for long

periods of time) you can zapped good!  Proper safety (ensuring that no charge is

contained in or about the Anode is to ground out the charge by as simple
hardware as a long 8" screwdriver blade with a heavy duty alligator claw style
clip attached to a shielded wire terminated to the metal cabinet housing the
monitor (base of chassis is fine) and make sure you have good contact at both
the chassis end and screwdriver blade.
    Hold the screwdriver's plastic handle (for isolation from voltage) and
gently work it under the Anode Cap (usually 1" to 2" in diameter with an
insulated wire leading to the high voltage supply) until it is firmly in contact

with the metal retaining clip that hold the Anode Cap to the glass cavity ......

with you do it right (depending on the charge) you should see or hear a
discharge of the voltage!  Always do this several times for complete safety.
NEVER DO THIS IF THE MONITOR IS TURNED ON!
   Want to know how a person gets zapped accidentally by 25K+ voltages? Just
rely on a push-on push-off power switch and not pull the power cord from the AC
outlet as a second safety measure .... that's why the last advice I can give is
PULL THE MONITOR POWER CORD OUT OF THE AC OUTLET! Don't rely on the switch, no
matter what type it is.

--- make the word phrase "shielded wire" read "insulated wire" in the
    above paragraph ---

   It has been many years since I have worked on monitors, but this is one
technician who woke up very fast one monday morning and learned the lesson so he

could live to be an older and wiser technician.

I'll toss in one more warning here -- notice in the previous message "do it
several times" -- in reference to bleeding off the high voltage on the CRT.
That is not just to make sure you did it -- CRTs are reluctant to give up all
their charge at once.  You can kill it once, wait 20 minutes, and pull a pretty
impressive spark from it AGAIN. Sneaky critters, those CRTs.

There are also LOTS of Mod files in the Amiga and PC Sigs here at Delphi. Which,

BTW, If I see any more MODs submnitted to the OS-9 sig, that are already in the
Amiga or PC sig, I will not accept them... There is no reason for the
duplication. Delphi doesn't have unlimited storage 8-)

Does Delphi have a Music sig? Maybe I should go and look, if it did, that would
probably be the _ideal_ place for MODS to be stored...

Hmm... I wasn't able to find a dictionary file anyplace... But, I added the
keywords "SPELL" and "DICTIONARY" to the following 4 submissions in the Users
Group Database:
     unwords
     words
     dict
     spell
The first two are for decompressing/compressing dictionary file that dict and
spell use... If you can find a plain ascii dictionary file/list of words
someplace, then you can make your own dictionary to use with these programs (
and, come to think of it, that might have been what I did, I generated a list of

words from the dictionary program on my Unix system, and then converted it to
the proper format on my CoCo)

Good luck...

I read your notes regarding the spell checker. I listed the docs for spell.c and

it mentions that you can create your own dictionary if it's in the right format.

What is the right format? I have access to UNIX dictionaries and I would like to

convert them for use with my Coco3. This would be really nice, because I have my

most commonly used unique words in the UNIX dictionary already. (A BIG TIME
SAVER). I must admit I haven't looked at the code yet to determine hat the
format might be, but I figured I would check with you before I take a guess.
Thanks for updateing those keywords as well.

You simply want a plain ASCII list of words, one word per line... Then you run
the "words" program on it, and it "compiles" it into the format that spell and
dict want... If you then want to modify the dictionary at a later date, you run
the "unwords" program, and it creates the ASCII list of words from the compiled
dictionary file.

Oh... and I _might_ have the functionality of words and unwords reversed, but
you get the basic idea, one makes the dictionary, the other "bursts" it...

If you get an ASCII list from the UNIX system of the dictionary, you could use
the util in the UG database (I forget the name, I could check though) to convert

it to the right format..just grab the ASCII list off the UNIX system and BANG!
you should be able to convert it..if you get a pretty good sized dictionary
file, why not compress it (preferrably with the new AR, since it is the best
compression we have so far) and upload it here.. if you dont want to take all
the time to upload it (if it IS that big) you could snail mail me a copy on
floppy, I could upload it, I have a 9600 (more with compression, but since the
file will already be compressed..) so I could upload it faster....

     screen saver
     From: BKITT        To: ALL

Ok.  I have it here.  The ultimate screen saver for the MM/1.
This is a REAL screen saver.  Here is how it works: You start up the process
from startup, or just run it from any command line, as a background process, or
as a process on a window. It attaches itself to keydrv, device driver for the
keyboard.  The program then tracks keypresses.  ANY keypress, shift, control, or

anything, will reset the counter.  Right now it is hardcoded for time, but this
will change before I finish it. Anyway, when it hits 5 seconds with no keypress,

it then calls up a screen saver, which flips you to a new window, and does
whatever you want. When this called up screen saver program exits, my program
will then return you back to the original window.
This works really good right now.  I am testing it now, and no problems that I
think will stop me from finishing this project.
I am working on mouse testing also.  Obviously I will have to check for mouse
movement as well as keyboard, but I want to make sure the keyboard is down pat
first.
I will be adding joystick testing also, so all inputs should be covered.
Anybody have any ideas they would like to include in this new little project?

 Well lets see,

        And, if passworded, lock out window switching.
   Third, randomize from some list, the actual screen saver called.

Fantastic!  That was something that I was going to try to do when I was
developing all those screen savers for Etha-GUI, but I really didn't
know how to get the info outta keydrv.  (BTW, I would assume this is
totally dependent on one specific version of keydrv.. in other words, if
keydrv is changed the screensaver-caller will not work?)

Just let it call any screen-saver program the caller wants so I can
write some screen savers!  ;)  Oh, it would also be very useful if the
screen saver could make the new screen (at least in some cases... maybe
some sorta flag to determine this?) so that some of my screen savers,
like "jigsaw screen" can know what screen they were called from in
order to get the display from that window and manipulate it on another
screen.

You have some great ideas there.
As for how I did it, here it is, real simple (for techies anyway).
After disassembling keydrv, I looked for where Kevin set up the interupt
processing.  I knew this was based on an interupt, so just started looking for
where he did an F$IRQ call.  I found this very easily. Based on the docs in the
OS9 manual, when this is called, A0 points to the address to processes the
interupt.  Only a couple of instructions before the F$IRQ, was the load into A0.

After seeing this, I then found where at in the code the interupt routine was
handled.  The first instruction loaded D0 from address 9ffc41, this is the port
for the keyboard input, so I knew I was onto the right area. The next 2
instructions see if a key was pressed, and if not, return. If it was, then key
processing takes place. I hack the first instruction following the test, and
make it a jmp to my program code instead of a move, which it currently is.  In
my program code, I set a flag in my data area, save the A2 register, which is a
pointer to the static storage area, and then do the move that I wiped out with
my jmp. I then jmp back to the next instruction after the original move.

I verify that these test instructions and move instructions are in place, if not

I put out an error message saying I cannot set up the hook, so you are right,
this maor may not work with other versions of keydrv.

As for the saver itself, it is working somewhat unpredicatably, because the
display 1b 21 codes are totally unreliable.  Until I get the display 1b 21
working consistently, I will be at a holding pattern on the screen saver.
Thanks for your feedback Joel.

Interesting way of doing that.  Too bad you can't add that "raw"
keyboard mode everyone's been wanting to make use of all the MM/1's keys.  ;)

I know what you mean... those 1b21 codes are annoyingly inconsistent in
their operation.  You notice that's why the screen doesn't flip when
using Etha-GUI.  One tip for you... try selecting both STDOUT and
STDIN... (paths 1 and 0).  I was forgetting to select path #0, and Mike
Haaland mentioned that gets control back for the mouse and keyboard,
etc. and my solve some of your problems... it helped with some of mine
at least!

Well, TTY (ASCII) would be great... the problem is determining what
characters are on the screen, given that the MM/1 is always in graphics
mode.  With the multiple fonts available, plus BOLD, and color schemes
to deal with, it would be almost impossible to write an ASCII screen
dump routine for the MM/1, UNLESS you can find the location where Kevin
Darling's K-Windows keeps the ASCII version of the screen/window.  He
must keep that somewhere, since he'd need it for the text cut/paste
between windows feature!

Very true, but I think the person wants this to run off the screen-saver
background program, so it would not be related to whatever apps may in

Didn't you already do some sort of screen snap shot program that saves a screen
into some non-generic file format?  Why not use that as as a basis for a screen
dump you can do?

InfoXpress 1.0 and 1.1, to the best of my knowledge, are Delphi and CIS
specific, i.e. they know how to get around on those two info utilities.

Whether it will learn about others (lapsing into anthropomorphism :-) is up to
Bill Dickhaus, the author of InfoXpress.  Judging by the existence of various
script files that it uses (that's all I am going by; I haven't tried to look at
their contents), my guess is that he's written it in a flexible fashion
anticipating other services, but that's purely speculation on my part and
personal opinion.  All I know is what I read in the papers.

(Then, too, there are systems that as far as I know don't publish their
protocols--if you aren't running a system that they put out an interface program

for, and that typically means PClone or Mac, they evidently don't consider you
worthy of notice.)

InfoXpress is currenly configured for use with Delphi, Compuserve, and in the
new version, Genie.  That's it.  If there are other services that you'd like to
see added, perhaps you should get together with Bill Dickhaus, the author, and
see what you two can work out.  Depending on the popularity of these other
services, Bill might want to add support for them.

BTW, what are these other services you mentioned?  BBS's?  Bill might be able to

add support for RiBBS sites, or similar BBS systems that have a predictable
prompt/reply structure.

The mail systems I want to access are on different systems where I work. I have
to log onto VMS mail (just like delphi mail), IBM Office vision mail, Lotus
CC:Mail, and UNIX mail. There are of course standards to allow all of these mail

systems to communicate, but of course no one wants to spend the $$ to do it. I'm

a communications administrator, so I get accounts on nearly every system. PC
pacakges like ProComm allow you to write scripts that can logon and grab things,

but I hate MS-DOS! Not only that, but it would be nice to read my mail all at
once whereever I might be. To complicate things, I'm a system administrator for
several Unix machines, which means I have to read my own account mail and the
mail for "root". I Love UNIX and it all makes sense compared to other systems.
That's why OS-9 is great. OS-9 is even better because it's so much smaller. I
really hope Microare creates personality modules for the new microkernal OSs
that will accompany the Power PC platforms. I think that may move OS-9 into the
mainstream. I know I could use it at work!

I need to do the same, since I'm a system administrator also.  The problem is
getting Bill and UNIX account on some machine and letting him work at it.  Right

now, he is not doing anything to InfoXpress--he's taking a well earned break

Not in any version that is available yet.  Bill is still working on it. It'll be

released sometime after to first of the year I'd guess.  Maybe even as late as
the Chicago Fest.

Perhaps you should contact Bill about beta testing since he'll need people with
Genie accounts for that.

 Allen,

 I may have misunderstood your earlier question.  If you are referring to
 starting an application from a window, unless the application accepts the
 font parameter and can process it, it will use the font specified in the
 environmental variable WINDOW.  You have a choice of 3 fonts when you start
 a new window.  But first, you must set the environment variable WINDOW
 describing the font you wish used in the window.  See your 'startup.gw' file.
 To make life a little easier, you can write a script file which would set the
 WINDOW environment and run your application.  You can add this file to your
 'custom menu' if you wish.  So far as I know, you can't change the font in
 an existing shell window from the command line.

 The source code for the 'quick fonts' is in /dd/GWINDOWS/SOURCE.  Look for
 'qfonts.a' - included is the 'makefile'.  You can either alter and (I think)
 add additional fonts.  It isn't difficult but it is tedious.  You can use
 the program 'calc' to help you with the binary/hex/decimal conversions.

 To access the general fonts you will need the developers pack.  The program
 I previously mentioned, 'font_demo.c' comes with the pack.  With the
 developers pack you'll be able to write apps that allow the user to select
 the font(s) he wants 'on the fly' and/or select the initial font if you wish.
 You'll have a choice of 3 font styles and sizes from 9 pts to 72 pts.

 You mentioned you used Microsoft Windows, Unix/"motif", Desqview/X, OS/2,
 and some others.  Can you give us your opinion of ease of use, versatility,
 etc. of G-WINDOWS as a windowing/GUI system versus the others?  I think many
 would like to know.

Thanks for the G-Windows tips.  A opportunity exists for an "Inside G-Windows"
book.  The normal user would not necessarily need such a book, but if you like
to "tinker", it would be nice.

As for commenting on G-Windows vs. MS-windoz (sp?), I need a little more time to

sort it out.  At first, when  I was new to G-Windows, I thought things were
missing. I would not feel comfortable with a rigorous comparison just yet.  One
thing real nice about G-Windows and OSK is the how fast the darn thing boots up
compared to OS/2 or , even worse, unix.  I can be up and running in maybe 10
seconds after the hard drive finishes its self-check.  Another neat feature is
how G-Windows "remembers" where it was when it was last powered down.  Just now,

when I first booted up, the same windows were displayed on the screen as when
the system was last powered down.  Of course, applications are not re-opened,
etc. but directory type windows and the shells are displayed.  Another neat
feature is the way that G-windows keeps a bit of status infomation updated along

with an icon.  For example, when I iconify this Sterm window that I am now
using, it lists the application name and the status of the process as "working".

On the negative side, the window borders and the Icons need to be smaller.  This

display is real clear and sharp so there is no need to have the Icons so large
(1" x 1").  Thinner window borders would make for a cleaner looking desktop, in
my opinion.   Over all, G-Windows is pretty fast.  The only places that I have
noticed problems are with a little bit of jerkiness when moving a window (might
be hardware specific) and I had hoped that image files would have come up
quicker (about 2 seconds for 640x480 -256 color from the hard drive).

Well, enough for now...

 Allen,

 In my previous message, I said that I thought you could have more than 3
 quick fonts.  Not so, you are limited to 3.  However, there are several
 things you can do if you want to have more than 3 fonts.  The easiest and
 least flexible is to have additional quick font modules.  You could load the
 alternate qfonts module when you start G-WINDOWS.  Another way would be to
 change the data in the qfonts module in memory.  It is a data module and as
 such can be written to.  I haven't tried doing either but it would be
 interesting to see the results.  If you write an application for G-WINDOWS
 using the Developer's Pack, you can do underlining, bold and change character
 color very easily.  And, you have many more fonts available.

 In addition to the original manuals written by Steve Adams, I include a
 tutorial on using G-WINDOWS to my customers.  It isn't as comprehensive
 as Steve's manual but it helps new users get started.  Steve is working
 on a tutorial for using the Developer's Pack.  Don't know when he'll have it
 done.

 I don't know anything about OS/2 but G-WINDOWS on a SYSTEM V has been com-
 pared very favorably with X-WINDOWS (Unix) on SPARC workstations with
 RISC chips by several people.  As to the speed of getting G-WINDOWS up and
 running, this depends on, among other things, how many directories (and how
 large they are) it has to read.  Several times I had opened so many
 directories (and most are large) that it could take almost a minute to get
 up and running.  Just goes to show you one can slow anything down if they
 try <g>.   BTW, have you checked out the extended directory listings?  Like
 MW's but includes the creation date, too.  Can be very handy at times.
 Don't forget you can alter the startup.gw file and start applications when
 you start G-WINDOWS.  If you prefer, you can start apps from the custom menu.

 Remember, most ports of G-WINDOWS today are allowing for resolutions greater
 than 640x480.  I normally use 800x600 with 14 or 15" monitors.  When I hook
 up a 17" or 20" monitor, I'll go to 1024x768.  At these resolutions, the
 borders are smaller and so are the icons.  A Japanese team is doing either
 a 1200x1000 or 1200x1200 port using the TI gfx chip and in Kanji.  They'll
 probably want larger borders and icons <g>.

 It is possible to have a window without a border but you'd lose the gadgets,
 scroll bars, etc.  You wouldn't be able to move it, resize it, hibernate it,
 etc.

 When moving a window, you only move the dotted outline with the mouse.  When
 you release the mouse button, the windows should be redrawn in the new
 location.  Overall, the action should be very smooth.  Is movement of the
 mouse pointer by itself smooth?  If not, then your problem is with the mouse
 or mouse driver.  Otherwise, I'm at a loss.

 Re the speed of the image drawing.  2 seconds is respectable for a 25 MHz
 machine, 640x480 resolution and 'viewimage'.  'Viewimage' is written in C
 and writes one pixel (1 byte for 256 colors) to the driver at a time via
 library functions so there is considerable overhead involved.  I've tried
 making similar measurements but they're quite difficult to do with any kind
 of accuracy.  Maybe one of these days I'll modify 'viewimage' and some other
 programs to permit execution time measurements.  Trying to make any measure-
 ments under 5 seconds becomes difficult unless the measurement is made within
 the program.  Measurements under say a few tenths of a second require entirely
 different techniques - like actual measurements on the bus.  Depends on what
 your measuring and the accuracy required.

 A couple of programs you may want to download.  Bezier Curves written by
 PAGAN (Stephen Carville).  Nice, snazy demo.  You'll see some real fast
 screen drawing.  Also, you'll see the use of the narrowest frame possible.
 The other is Viewfax (don't forget the data file).  After you start it,
 hibernate it.  The icon will say 'working'.  When it's finished, the icon
 will change to 'waiting'.

 I'd like to see STerm modified for G-WINDOWS - particularly for downloading
 files.  While I'm answering your message, I'm downloading Ghoscript files -
 mostly huge.  Be nice if the download started a new window from within STerm.
 Could hibernate it and wait for the message to change from working to waiting.
 To monitor progress, the error count could be directed to the status window.
 Alternatively, the window can be started hibernating.  Wonder who we can get
 to do it.  Hate to add it to my list.  Only item no 1000000 - hex that is <g>.

 Have you tried 'calc' yet?  Very simple calculator but handles conversions
 from decimal to hex to binary.  Real handy when programming.

 Have fun,

 Ed

 No need to do so much work.  'Viewimage' opens "/dd/sys/errmsg,  probably to
 provide error messages for the g_alert() function.

 If you modify the qfonts in memory, you will affect _every_ program that
 uses them.  There are some programs that are hard coded to use the large and
 small fonts.  This could get real interesting during window refreshes.  If
 you do try something like this, let me know what happen - I'm curious enough
 to let someone else try it <g>.

     Wish List Update
     From: MARKGRIFFITH To: ALL

To All OS-9/OSK programmers and wanna be's:

About a year ago, I published a 'wish list' if programs I thought the OS-9
community would want.  The idea was to give all the programmers out there some
ideas so they could get busy.

Here are the results after one year....and some more suggestions. My original
comments are marked with a '>' on each line.

File Compression Utilities

>We have most of the common ones (lharc, Sea-Arc, AR, UNIX compress, etc) >A
program to combine all these together would be an excellent tool. >Better yet,
something with a graphical interface to maintain an archive >of files.  Carl
Kreider's AR code would be a good starting point if >the programmer was
considerate enough to ask Carl about it first.

Nothing much has happened here.  There is the 'extractor' program, but it could
be improved upon.

Floppy Disk Duplicators

>A dup utility would be great....with a GFX interface or not.  Should be >able
to store the entire contents of a disk in memory and then write >it out to a new

disk (or several in different drives) as quickly as >possible.  Would be great
for developers.

Nothing has happened in this area.  I was working on a utility, but stopped
after hitting a snag in the floppy driver.  That may get more work done on it
soon depending if I can overcome that snag.  We also need utilities for
formatting and reading/writing PC and Macintosh disks.

Menuing Systems

>We could use something like Xtree or like the Norton disk managers. >Should be
able to display directory trees and move/copy/delete files. >A simple text and
hex dump display would be very handy too.  A point >and click interface would be

create here.  I have code already done >for reading in directory trees so this
could be some help to anyone >wishing to work in this area.

I am not aware of anything in this area yet.  EthaWin might fit the bill, but I
haven't seen it.  I understand it is more of a text based 'gui' than an Xtree
look-a-like.

Fancy Printing on Dot Matrix Printers

>A program to print the IFF files used on the MM/1 would be great.  Also, >
something like PRINTSHOP with clip art graphics and all would be a >very useful
item.  Clip art can be bought from just about anyplace and >comes in all sorts
of standard formats like MAC, PIC, etc.  Should be >able to read one or more of
these.

John Wainwright has ported Ghostscript which certainly fits the bill here.  More

work is needed for something specific to OS-9.

Bar Coding

>Programs to read bar code wands would be very handy.  You could sell the >
hardware and utilities to read the data.  That way programmers can >use your
utilities and/or routines to include in their applications. >A library for C
could be easily developed.

Nothing done in this area at all.  Industrial users would sure like to see
something here.

Laser Printing

>Let's face it, Postscript is fast becoming the de facto page description >
language.  TeX is nice, but only used in university environments.  We >need some

utilities to take PROFF or MROFF files and generate Postscript >output,

world that can do that is someone wants to port it.  I >also have a utility that

takes generic ASCII text files and generates >Postscript output.  Could be used
to make something much better.

We now have Lout and, of course, TeX.  Two excellent packages.  The
"Metamorphosis" magazine is done using Lout and a few other programs.

Hard Disk Backup

>The basics are done, drivers and utilities for backing up large SCSI >drives
exist now and can be purchased from IMS.  This route costs too >much for the
average hobby user, so someone could make up a FastBack >clone to floppies.  I
already have my HDBACKUP utility for OS9 and OSK, >but it is slow although very
reliable.  Someone could take that and >make it faster or develop something of
their own.  This would sell >well.

Several entries in this area, but no 'gui' based utilities yet.  The industrial
users would really like to have something that works well, is fast, and keeps a
database of the files backed up so they can easily find out which tape a certain

file is one.

Calendars and Appointment Books

>A need for good calendar programs is needed, both using the GFX windows >and
text screens.  Even better is something that will use alarms to >signal the user

when an event is reached that can be programmed >several days in advance.  Maybe

mail or send something to the printer. >Should be easy to use and have a built
in appointment editor of some sort. >Some things could be developed to replace
the standard Gcal like utilities >that will be coming out with the GUI (whenever

it appears).

Bill Wittman is working a a calendar utility, but it is not finished yet.  We
need more in this area.  This stuff can sell if it is done well and has loads of

features.

Text Editors

>We have this pretty much under control with uemacs, VI, and VED, not >to
mention the expensive stuff Ed Gresick sells.

I think we have enough in this area now.  With Write-Right! no available, I
don't think anything else is needed.

Forms Generators

>Some applications/utilities to generate forms, either for mail-merging >or
special application forms (like invoices, bill-of-sale, etc) would >be very
useful.  Should be able to work with a variety of printers. >Shouls also be in a

have some code here that does a good job of >this.  This could be expanded upon
to make it more functional.

Nothing done in this area.  Come on guys.....this should be pretty easy to do.

Spell Checkers/Thesarus

>A good spell checker for ASCII files is much desired.  Dictionaries of >several

hundred thousand words can be bought for a couple hundred >dollars.  Smaller
libraries can be had for free.  Should be fast and >include a word lookup
feature.  Great if it could be called from within >an application and run in a
pop-up window.

This area is covered with the public domain SC ported by Ken Scales. Someone
might want to take that and wrap a GUI around it.

Spreadsheets

>This is pretty much covered with Ken Scales SC port and Calc09 (expensive). >A
Euclid-3D type spreadsheet would be nice.

We could use something that is specific to OS-9 that can read and write Lotus
and Excel spreadsheet files.  Or, utilities to translate Lotus, Excel, and
Quattro files into a format SC could use.

Flat-File Database

>A simple PC-File type database for the masses.  Should be easy to use >and as
flexible as possible.  Should include ability to read and export >dBase files
and possibly others.  Also include datafiles from the main >spreadsheet programs

like Calc09 and SC.....maybe Dynacalc for the >CoCo people.

Still haven't seen anything here yet.  Come on guys...this would sell well.

Graphics Tools

>A "screen builder" program would allow a developer to create their >program
screens by moving buttons, slides, and other objects around on >the screen to
make it look like they want.  Then, the program would >output the code and data
structures to re-create that screen in C, BASIC09, >or whatever.  Would be a
great help for developers and probably everyone >would buy a copy.

Paul Fitch is working on something in this area.  It's good too!

>Other graphics tools would be animation builders, tools to manipulate >GIF,
TIFF, and other files into different formats, and tools to read >in clip art
done for the MAC, Atari, Amiga, or IBM and convert them >to IFF format for the
MM/1.

We need graphics conversion programs.  I have some that I will be uploading in
the future, but we need more that will work with the more common files like TIFF

and PICT files.

Business Applications

>There is a real need for these.  Payroll, accounting, ledger, checkwriter, >and

such.  Point-of-sale systems would be a good seller since you can >multitask and

run the entire store, including text editing and >communications, from the POS

>A good inventory system (maybe using bar code readers) that keeps track >of
what is on hand, automatic reorder, debit from the POS position, >would be very
handy for retailers.

>Shipping systems for UPS and regular post office would be good also. >
Information for calculating shipping costs is readily available.

Nothing has appeared in this area yet.  There are thousands of commercial users
out there that would like to see thing like this.  Think about it. You write a
program, sell it for say, $100.  If 1000 commercial users like it and buy it,
that's $100,000.00 in your bank.  Could you live off that for a year or two?  I
sure could!

Home Finance Programs

>If you don't think these sell look at the success of the "Quicken" >software
package.

Still something needed here.

Mathematics and Statistics

>Should be easy to do for the math minded.  We could use a good data >analysis
program including graphing and such.  I have some excellent >routines for
graphing data on the printer that could be included. >Screen graphing should
also be included.

>Mandelbrot generators would also be handy for computer science students

Also data anaylsis programs for the industrial users.  These sort of
applications command a big price if they are done well.

Bible Search

>Programs to access full texts of the Bible and the Book of Mormon would >be
very popular.  These should include some sort of hypertext features >for quick
lookup of key words and a very quick access routine.  The >full text of these
and other words are available for small fees from >several sources.

Neil Brookins has this area covered.  Needs a GUI and it is perfect!

Weather

>Utilities to access the accu-weather GIF maps from Conpuserve and make >an
animation of the weather over several hours or days would be >excellent tools.
Also, weather maps are available broadcast via the >Ham packet radio network on
a regular basis.  Tools to capture and save, >print, animate those would be good

sellers.

Accu-weather has a dial up service like Delphi for CIS for getting weather
information.  Programs to make use of this service would be a good seller to
those people that need reliable weather prediction information on a regular
basis.  Lots of potential here.

Games

>All sorts are needed from the simple chess games to the very best in >arcade
quality.  Adventure games, Star Trek games using graphics, and >simulators like
air traffic control would be widely enjoyed.

Still need some here.  Smash was recently introduced and is a good game but
simple.  We need the quality games that the MSDOS and MAC people are running,
along with stereo sound.

The list is endless.  I hope that somethings in here might stir some programmers

out there into doing one or more of these suggestions. I would be happy to talk
to anyone about these if they like.  Call me at (314) 583-1168.

Mark, I wish to fill some gaps in your list:

Flat file Database- ENC-9 from Northern X-Posure Good point-n-click interface -
CoCoTop from C. Dekker. This uses gfx5 driver for pull down menu boxes, other
than tha is text (similar to Etha-Win). Easy to configure on floppy or hard
drive, can launch applications in any type window (starts a new window,
 kills that window upon exit). Can even put several of your own utils in one of
the menus. Easy enough to set up, will run from a hard drive also. The only
thing some don't like is there is no source code for the HD installation
program. This makes some ol d-time OS-9 users nervous!

Home Finance - C. Dekker also has a finance program for home users that tracks
a number of items.

Accounting - C.Dekker again! He has a single entry accounting system that would
be great for small business.

Inventory - I have a good inventory/invoice database. Currently, it will print
several reports and invoices, but doesn't subtract invoice items from inventory,

which would make it nearly a complete POS system. I have this priced at $25
including source. Th e source "license" just states that copies of any modified
source needs to be sent in for consideration for future upgrades, and two free
upgrades are included for those who do send in modifications.

I've seen all these products... handled C.Dekkers line at the Atlanta 'fest.
Will get an address for you later..

Great!  Good to see people are doing something.  I didn't know about these

Mark,
     Actually there is a POS for 6809.  The Glenside Club uses it.  POS is a
relatively easy program to write.  The hardware interface should be easy as
well.  Most cash drawer systems work of ...off of the printer to open the
drawer. The Glenside Club uses the motor on/off relay hooked to a second realasy

.... realy...ARGH relay to open the drawer.  The sytem supports 4 terminals with

a maze program running on the monitor, a hard drive and RAMpak as well as any
other thing you can fit in.  GCCC also has a bar code generator for mailing
labels.  Takes Profiles files and make bar codes on the labels.  I don't know
much about this program but can find out avbout it and see if it is written in
C or what.  Many bar code readers have an RS-232 interface.  They do the code
conversion internally.  Such a reader would fit the bill...Just need a small
program to read the ascii...there may even be such a creature in the PC sig that

is PD with source.  Anyway, I'm willing to work on the POS.  Joel Hegberg is the

original author and I've been after him to work on it some more. Maybe this post

will get him inyterested again. Carl Hey Joel you listening??????  $$$$$  ;-)

Carl,

 > Actually there is a POS for 6809.  The Glenside Club uses it.

From what you write, it sounds like the POS you describe is a hacked up system,
not at all suitable for sale.  Also, it is again written for the CoCo.  There is

no commercial value in this.  Why would someone other than a CoCoHead want to
buy or even use this?  Can you give me any sound non-emotional reason?  There
isn't any.  So basically, there is no POS system available.

What I am referring to in my wish list is PROFESSIONAL applications that don't
have any "gee, I didn't have time to finish this, maybe someone else will"
statements in the electronic documentation.  We need applications that are
shrink wrapped and ready to run on a viable OS-9 system like OSK or OS-9000, not

hacked up pseudo-junk for a dead OS on an orphaned machine.

I know that sounds bad, especially on a forum where most of the people run said
system, but this is reality.  No amount of wishful thinking is going to make the

CoCo or applications for it a hot seller.  It's this kind of thinking that has
kept OS-9 in the closet for so long.

     RE: Wish List Update (Re: Msg 82529)
     From: EDELMAR      To: MARKGRIFFITH


 Mark,

 I offer a POS running under OSK (also UNIX).  It is full featured; i.e.,
 includes separate retail and wholesale/distributor front ends, inventory
 management, ordering, A/R, A/P, full accounting, G/L, SQL, etc.  Can handle
 up to 99 separate organizations.  It is written in SCULPTOR.

 I have only 2 packages out under OS-9 and one of these customers is consider-
 ing converting to networking.  I have many more packages out running under
 UNIX.

 The market I address is the small to medium market - 4 to 50 users.  I don't
 address the 'mom and pop' operation.  About 5 years ago I tried to get
 approved by Tandy for their Dealer/Franchise operation.  Approval was
 denied because 1) it didn't run under MSDOS (specifically their machines)
 and 2) it didn't run under 'ViaNet'.  They've since switched the latter
 requirement to Novel.  It's a long story best told after a few drinks <g>.

 I won't get into all the marketing problems but suffice to say the dominent
 forces are NCR and IBM.  Novell, through some third party vendors, is making
 a strong push.  While OSK performance is superb, the lack a WP and spread-
 sheet kills OSK in this marketplace.

 The very low end market, 1 to say 4 to 6 users, is dominated by Real World.
 The user can start out with a single user package at under $500 and expand
 his operation using some of the low-cost networking packages available and
 they do support Novell.  They also provide interfaces to several spreadsheet
 packages, Quicken and several other packages.  Other packages are available
 from the various retail trade organizations.  Most of these packages are full-
 featured; i.e., they include the POS, inventory management, ordering, A/P,
 A/R, accounting, etc.  The strongest influence on the selection of packages
 today in the very low end market is by the owner's accountant.

 One other point.  I think the price you're suggesting is way too low.  I
 don't believe a package priced at $100 (or thereabouts) will be taken
 seriously by anyone.  See Bob van der Poel's comments re the pricing of VED
 when he tried to sell it to industrial users which appeared in the Underground
 several issues back.

 As to why my package wasn't succesfull, it's all marketing.  I couldn't afford
 a national advertising, mailing, etc. campaign.  I depended on word of mouth
 (and 2 VARs).  In retrospect, had I contacted and worked out agreements with
 several accounting firms around the country (instead of VARs), I think things
 may have turned out differently.  But it would have had to sold under UNIX.

Ed, I agree with you partially about pricing. Pricing in the industrial world is

very different from the "home market". That is a problem... if it isn't priced
sky high then the industry people turn up their noses, while those who do write
good stuff want prices way out of bounds for the average personal user. Look in
the UnderGround. How many personal users can/will pay $300-$400 for a disk
optimizer? They wouldn't even pay that in the MS-DOS market!!!

Mark,
     I did not mean to imply that a POS on the CoCo was by any means a viable
commercial product.  I think if you read my msg again you will note I was only
pointing out that one had been done for a CoCo and it wouldn't be that hard to
do the same undrer OSK.  In fact the OSK version should be even easier since the

ports (serial) and drivers are more reliable than on a CoCo.  I also pointed out

that most cash drawrs on a POS system are actau...actuated by the receipt
printer.  This makes it VERY easy to hook a cash drawer to the POS.  I couldn't
afford to buy the printer so I improvised.  As a matter of interest I intend to
have a working POS in the near future.  It will be running undrer OS9 (what
flavor I'm not quite sure) with at least 2 terminals an 2 cash drawers.  On
another tact though, the CoCo would not be ideally suited to be a host for a POS

but a 6309 based computer would be ideal IF it were designed to be a POS
machine.  It would be low cost and more than adequate to do all that was needed
for a small POS (say up to 8 terminals).  Thse are just my thoughts on the
subject.  Before you attack the CoCo POS idea again though, remember that there
are still a lot of PC and XT based POS systems in use in small businesses.  I
know, I just did a hard drive recovery on one.  The owner is a persoanal friend
of mine (but not as much now)  <grin>.  He is using an old IBM XT with a pair of

ST225's hooked to 2 terminals and one cash drawer with a receipt printer.  The
hard drive sounded like a coffee grinder.  I was able to save about 75% of the
data using PC Tools.  Oh well, best wishes, Carl

 I'm sure that most individual users look at pricing before they buy and will
 go with the cheapest package.  That is a primarily price-driven market where
 quality and/or features can be compromised to lower the price.  Also, the
 usual user doesn't have a clear idea of what he wants in a piece of software
 until it fails him.

 The industrial market expects the software they buy to be high quality and
 99.999% reliable and they are willing to pay the necessary premium ($$$) to
 get it.  They will certainly comparison shop amongst comparable packages
 and, in an ideal world, but the package with the best price and quality
 trade-off.  Of course factors like advertising, name recognition, sleeping
 with the buyer <g> all have an effect too.

 To establish OS9 in the mainstream will mean selling to those industrial
 users. That means high quality, rock-solid applications that are going to
 cost some $$$.  Once the customer base is there the cost of software will
 come down.

 Frank,

 First, I can assure you the industrial market is very price sensitive.  They
 expect a return on their investment.  It may be cutting costs or some other
 factor but the final analysis is the bottom line.  Will profits increase.
 Many are even unwilling to try new software unless the provider can present
 compelling reasons for the expenditure of time.  Remember, times are tough
 even for the blue chip Companies.  Try competing in the custom software
 arena.  Often, you have to spend many hundreds of hours writing sample soft-
 ware proving to the customer your approach is best without any compensation -
 only the hope that you will win the contract.

 > They wouldn't even pay that in the MS-DOS market!!!

 I don't think you're presenting a good example.  This is a utility.  As to
 whether it is overpriced or not, the market will tell.  That some can't afford
 the price shouldn't be the issue.  More correctly, is it worth the price!
 Each prospective purchaser will have to judge that for themselves.  How many
 MS-DOS users can afford Autocad?  Is it overpriced?  If we magically had
 Autocad ported to OSK, would you say $3500 is too much?  That's the MS-DOS
 price.  I know, the main market is industrial, but there are a few personal
 users who have purchased it.  Those who may have wanted it and couldn't afford
 it have purchased lower priced versions for several hundred dollars.

 The SCULPTOR development system for OSK sells for almost $3000.  Too much?
 Well, how about IMS from Clearbrook - I believe the OSK version sells (sold)
 for around $400.  I'm not familiar with the OSK version of IMS but I did try
 the CoCo version (much lower price) - it was solid.  Worked as advertised.
 Why don't we hear more about them - are they still in business?  But many
 MS-DOS personal users pay a comparable price for D-Base.

 We had Dynacalc and Stylograph for both the CoCo and OSK.  When they came
 out and for quite a while, they were as good or better than Visacalc and
 WordStar.  I do remember (in the CoCo market) people complaining about the
 prices saying they wouldn't pay that much.  Where are the Companies now?
 Where are the users who complained the loudest - most have gone to MS-DOS
 and _are_ paying those prices and more.

 The following is an extract from a message recently posted by Paul Seniura on
 the CoCoList and forwarded to me.

 Is he right?  If so, then why should I continue to advertise in your magazine?
 Your cost per subscriber is high (Byte is cheaper) and the content devoted
 mostly to the CoCo'er.  And I can apply the cost per subscriber to your two
 competing magazines with similar answers.  In fact, extending his thinking,
 you should not charge advertisers or subscribers.  Realistically, what's the
 difference between the effort someone puts into writing software and the
 effort you put into publishing your magazine?  Why should you be paid and
 the programmer not.  Of course, a further extension of that kind of thinking
 suggests that I should provide hardware free, also!

 Please don't get the idea I'm against PD software.  I'm not.  I use some
 and I was the one that brought the TOP Release 2 software to the US.  How-
 ever, the quality (user friendliness) and variety, comes nowhere near what
 is available for other OSs.  As such, it will not assist the personal OS-9
 group to 'prosper'.

 He is right that the current number personal OS-9 users cannot support any
 business venture.  However, encouragement (demand quality products, good
 support and be willing to pay realistic prices) from the personal users might
 help the personal market to grow.  But, it may already be too late.

 From personal experience I can testify that the 'home market' should be
 irrelevant to software pricing for the Macintosh and IBM comtemptibles.

 One company I worked for used Macs in the sales, production and quality
 departments.  Whenever an employee bought a Mac for their home they would
 bring a box or two of disks and I would make copies of most of the company's
 commercial software for them to take home.  This was done with the de facto
 approval of management.

 The rationale for this was; if those people are using the same software at
 home as they use at work, they will also be able to take work home with
 them.  So, for the price of my time (I always did the copying on company
 time) and a few disks (new Mac owners usually stole a box or two) the
 company would be able to get some work done for free that it would have had
 to pay for otherwise.  Believe me, the balance worked in the company's favor
 just about every time.

 Others, in similar positions, have told me, when asked, that the companies
 they work for do pretty much the same thing.  This is, probably, an
 advantage that OS9 is never going to enjoy.

 I believe that OSK can take some advantage of those PD programs with the
 right approach.

 For example, one thing Mark Griffith mentioned in his 'wish list' was "File
 Compression Utilities" and mentioned a few common ones: lharc, Sea-Arc, AR,
 UNIX compress, etc.  All of these are PD.

 One way to make a freindlier app is to combine all that code into one great
 big monster app with switches to decide which block to use.  This is the
 'conventional' approach.  An alternative is to create a front end that can
 recognize the files of each type and fork the proper utility with the
 correct switches.  With an environment like G-Windows, the front end could
 easily tell you what files are in the archive, let you select which files to
 extract, what's in a directory, let you select which files to add...I think
 you'll get the picture.

 This way, the programmer doesn't need access to anyone's code, the utility
 author can concentrate on what the program does and the front end can be as
 hardware specific as the author want's it to be without compromising the
 usefulness of the component utilities to the rest of us or to another front
 end.

 I realize that it would not be a trivial task to use this approach but it
 would, I think, be easier than the monolithic-mega-monster (3M!) method that
 has been the norm.  Also this technique is not adaptable to _every_ type of
 program but we have discussed, in the past, a similar approach using
 linkable subroutines - an approach which G-Windows uses to excellent
 effect.

 > How many users can your POS system accomodate and what hardware do you use
 > under OSK?

 There is no 'limit' per se as to how many users can use the POS.  One OSK
 system I sold used a SYSTEM IV (68000 @ 16 MHz) and was for 8 users.  When
 it was installed, we ran a test with 8 people banging away at the same time
 for about 3-4 minutes.  No one detected any difference in response viz-a-viz
 when they used the system alone.  There wasn't even any wait for the invoices
 to be printed (a 200 cps printer).  By the time they made change and reached
 to the printer to get the invoice, it was there.  I suspect this is near
 the limit if all users bang away at the same time.  But remember, this type
 of a situation is rare - in fact, the real load is probably only a few per
 cent of the real capabilities.  Look at your supermarkets.  They have rows
 of check-out counters and except at peak hours, most are unmanned.  Even
 when they are checking someone out with their bar code readers, there is
 much idle time at each location.  Incidently, this particular user had a
 couple of terminals in the back room for accounting, etc.  Originally, they
 used QuickEd for word processing but wanted a 'real' WP so they added a
 286 box.

 If a SYSTEM V is used, I'm confident over 40 users could be accommadated.

 Another point of reference for you.  The original SCULPTOR POS program
 was written for a CoCo.  I had 4 terminals hooked up to 2 of Ron Schmidt's
 (L & R Tech) Superboards.  With 3 users there was no detectable slowdown.
 Only when a 4th person started banging away was there any detectable slow-
 down but even that wasn't objectionable.

 I'd suspect your print shop management program doesn't impose any kind of
 a particular heavy load so you shouldn't need any kind of a heavy duty power
 house to run it.  But, assume you added DTP capability to the same system
 (if it were available).  DTPs require a great deal of processor time and as
 such could slow the POS down.  You can get around this by assigning higher
 priorities to the POS but this would slow the DTP down.  It's all a matter
 of balance.

 Good luck with your efforts.  If you need hardware, I'd be happy to talk
 to you.  In addition to the SYSTEMs IV & V, I sell VME systems.

You are absolutly right Ed. I guess the point I was trying to make is that many
of the programs home users would buy are rather high priced. I know comparing
OS-9 to the MS-DOS market isn't exactly fair either.... but in order for OS-9 to

get into the mainstream there has to be good, reasonably priced software. The
MS-DOS crowd gets by charging less for adequate packages (try the PFS series)
due to the volume they sell. The current OS-9 market is more the opposite- they
have to charge more per item to make up "reasonable" profit. Which gets back to
why sell 10 of
 an item and make $100 off each when you can just as easily sell 1 for a much
higher price and make the same $1000 profit? Just different marketing
philosophies. In some ways, that fellow you quoted is right.. OS-9 IS currently
just a fringe market. But I don't agree with his ideas about writing software.
People like you, me, and many others are working to increase that fringe market
and (hopefully) to eventually bring it OUT of the fringes and into a larger part

of the main-stream. OS-9 needs a lot of GOOD
 $100 or less applications to gain much real interest. I'm not necessarily
talking about DBase IV and Word Perfect 5.0... more like the PFS series. Tools
that may not have all the frills, but do have the most used ones. Those are the
things that will get t he home users attention more. Professional/Industrial
users may need more than that. And maybe that's part of the problem too. There
is a very diverse market out there!! And the market segment (for OS-9) is small.

No one will agree with everything I've sai d here, I don't expect it. But we
have to get people talking about and DOING something about all this!!

Well, ther termination avoids "ringing" on the bus.  Usually put on the "last"
device in the bus.  I don't know about powering devices on and off since all my
devices are powered on and off together.  I would imagine that a device being
switched could send some voltage spikes down the bus but I don't know if they
would damage anything but they could be interpreted as false data as a
possibility.  This is only a guess on my part.  To be safe, I wouldn't do it. (

You probably won't find any data anywhere on this other than personal
experiences.  I don't recommend powering on/off devices on the bus, but I have
done it myself in emergencies.  I've even unplugged SCSI devices and plugged in

Powering up a SCSI bus without proper termination will usually result in a flaky

system.  Not always tho--depends on the SCSI devices.  I have a drive here that
works fine with no termination on it at all.

The AUV Odyssey is a 2.2 meter long, 0.6 meter diameter, teardrop-shaped robot
submarine capable of diving as deep as 6,000 meters.  It is controlled by an
onboard real-time computer manufactured by OR systems and running the OS9
operating system.  OS9 is very similar to UNIX, and familiarity with UNIX and C
is sufficient to easily & quickly learn OS9.  All programming is done in C
and/or C++.  Knowlege of event-driven programming and I/O programming is
desirable, but not absolutely crucial.

The AUV Odyssey will be going under the ice of the Arctic Ocean in April '94 for

ice measurements and then to the Juan de Fuca Ridge, off the coast of Seattle,
in summer of '94 to examine hydrothermal vents.  Other missions have been
planned for the autumn of '94 and spring of '95.

     wish list notes
     From: MIKE_GUZZI   To: MARKGRIFFITH

Mark, Looking over your "wish" list I can offer a few things.

Floppy disk duplicator: my mbackup program does almost that. it was designed to
copy a disk using more then 64K on a CoCo. I can modify it to allow for multiple

destinations provided it can read the entire disk in 1 pass (if the user has
enough memory to load the whole source disk in) If interested I will make the
modifications.

JTFM is a text base file handler utility that allows copy/delete/make dir and
many options. it is great for selectivly minipulating files in a directory and
is very fast and powerful. Only "problems" with it is it will only display the
proper mfree report if 512K. It doesn't affect anything, just makes it look like

you don't have alot of memory! It also does not handle clustering for the disk
free report. Again not harmful, just the information is misleading.

I have some PD programs for the mandelbrot plots. Its not fancy but it will
generate maps.

I can suggest one game Id like to see: Missle command! its an old agame but
would be easy to make for os9 (simple line graphics) I love that game and still
play POLARIS which was the rom-pak version. That would be an easy game to make
for os9. (but im no game programmer otherwise I would have made it)

Well thats my thoughts. if you want to look at the programs i mentioned mbackup
is availabe here, jtfm isn't but I have it

OK, but it's only available as PDware and would need to be hacked on to work as
a disk duplicator.  Also, it is not available only for OS-9/6809. A version that

worked on OSK and OS-9000 is what is needed.

Why should someone spend all that time required to write a game that is almost
10 years old?

Come on people.  This wish list is for software that someone would like to buy
and use on their system as a professional, not for yet another hacker to play
with.  We need complete packaged systems, not hacked together pieces that need
this and that to work correctly.

I see the ideas, but no one will do the work required.  Why is that?

Well, let me say this and then wait for the flood.  I have a few MM/1 boards
here, both mother boards and I/O boards.  If someone came to me and said, "Gee,
I have this great idea for a great application and all I need is a system to
make it on.", I might be inclined to loan that person a board set for them to
create this masterpiece on.  Of course, they would have to come up with the rest

of the system, like a monitor, keyboard, disk and hard drives, but that
shouldn't be too difficult.

Of course, all this depends upon the individual having an idea I think it
worthwhile, and having them show me some work they have already done on it.  I'm

not going to give out a board set based soley upon a whim. My goal here is to
get OSK applications written, not to give someone a new system.

Got any good ideas?

Mark, there is another way to get a (relatively) inexpensive OSK system.
Peripheral Tech has some used PT68K2 boards (10MHz 68000) with 1MB of RAM for
only $99 plus shipping. One would still have to come up with a case, power
supply, keyboard, and disk drives... hard drive controller and hard drive if
desired... and also a monitor (CGA or mono would work fine).. but a complete
system can be put together for less than the all new ones cost. And OSK is $299
(? I think) form them. Now this wouldn't be K-windows compatible, but would be
generic OSK, which I believe anything written under that would run on an MM/1.
The entire system including a hard drive and monitor could be put together for
under a grand, less if parts ca n be collected from a flea market... or buy an
old 8088 machine and upgrade it with a K2 board!

well, one thing I think could be of use is somesort of _good_ user interface for

terminal based apps, if the MM/1 can support , in some way more than 1 mouse,
even mouse support could be added to terminal apps, because the MM/1 uses
"standard" mice, a cordless mouse extender could be used, or  one the the mouse
extenders that DO use cords (although I would imagine that would be a pain) this

way Vt100 (or any terminal actually) could use mouse support and with the "line"

graphics could use pull down menus and such..similar to the interfaces commonly
used in DOS apps. of course a mouse wouldnt have to be used, hot keys or arrow
keys could be used too..for those that use terminals to the MM/1 (or their
coco's even) a nice UI would be nice...with a little extra work it could be used

to launch apps that have KWindows text codes hardcoded, these apps could be
called through pipes and convert the kwin codes to the terminal codes, and the
terminal arrow keys to kwin codes.. I have thought of that for the coco, but the

work involved would be a fair amount, and the coco market is small, coco users
with terminals is even smaller, but I think most OSk users probably have the
coco set up as a terminal or have a real terminal hooked up..and of course this
would run on any OSk machine, the Kwin <-> terminal code filter(s) could be an
external program or module..and actually, if Kwindow programs could be ran on
say, a TC70 (although wouldnt work right because of the screen control codes)
some programs might be able to be used on the other OSk machines..maybe.. maybe
even gfx program could be done, if there was a gfx terminal on the other end..

That's good information to have.  However, the people I'm talking with can't
afford a couple hundred bucks let alone close to a grand for a machine.  My
offer is to GIVE a board set away, and a copy of OSK, if someone really needs
it.  Actually, it's not a giveaway, but a LOAN.

Forget it.  What we don't need is yet another user interface.  We need the
APPLICATIONS to interface with.  Let's broaden out perspective here a little and

look at the bigger picture.  There are NOT ENOUGH good applications out there to

justify anyone other than an OS-9 nut to buy one of these machines.  The only
place where OSK has any broad user base is in the industrial/commercial market.
So, WE NEED NEW APPLICATIONS THAT CATER TO THEM!  Not a user interface for
CoCoHeads.

Look at my wish list again and see what I'm talking about.  If you have any
other ideas, let me know.

Steamed a bit, are we?  ;)

Actually, folks, CocoHeads comment aside, Mark has the right of it here. We need

applications.  We have standards.   And some people out there complaining about
buggy software just might check their cheap EQUIPMENT first. I recently became
able, for the first time, to duplicate what some have reported as bugs in
KWindows.   B ugs there may be, but THIS bug was directly related to my MOUSE.
The button switch loosened up until one button would click itself!  Just
happened to be the 3rd button, that shifted me from one window to another.   So,

1)  Demand more applications, and WR ITE them, and 2)  avoid equipment that is
too cheap. (not inexpensive,  just CHEAP).

David,
     I must agree with you about the software.  Too often I find software that
should not be sold a as a commercial product in our niche market because it is
full of bugs but before I complain about it I check to see if it runs undre
stock OS-9 and stock drivers and descriptors.  Too often something I've done to
my system is the culprit.

     MM1-68340
     From: JOHNREED     To: ALL

 I got one of the MM/1 68340 accelerator boards at the
 Atlanta 'Fest.  Zack Sessions has already posted an
 excellent technical description and review of the upgrade,
 but I thought I would add a couple notes on my own
 experience with the faster system - and a couple more
 "gotcha"s.

        I did not have the "slow" PAL chips on my I/O board, but
 just when I thought I was safe, I discovered some on the
 8-meg memory board.  Replacing them was not as hard as I
 thought it would be, but not a job for someone without
 experience in repairing electronics.  Like a famous coach
 said about passing is a football game -- "Three things can
 happen - two of them are BAD".

        It is, of course, FASTER.  Thats why we bought it.  The
 TeX and PostScript (and Ghostscript) programs I have been
 playing with lately take a lot of time.  Building a new font
 for TeX ran about 15 minutes before, now its about 7.  I
 don't have a "dhrystone" program (or even a whetstone), but
 I can easily see the increase in speed.  I did run the
 little basic "benchmark" program that Frank Hogg posted some
 time ago, and the 68340 came in right about where you would
 expect it.

 Results of Frank's basic benchmark
 (the program)
  SHELL "date -j"
  FOR j=1 to 12
    FOR i=1 to 1000
      a=SQRT(i)
      b=INT(a)
      IF a=b THEN a=b
      ENDIF
    NEXT i
  NEXT j
  SHELL :date -j"

 (my MM/1)
 mm1 68340      16.59   68340   N/A    35

        It boots from the hard drive.  Twice it has stumbled a
 little on a cold start when it looked for the drive before
 it was up to speed, but it got it on the second try.  Both
 of my hard drives, a 40 meg conner and a 40 meg quantum work
 fine as "/dd".

        Zack said he got a new "shell" -- I didn't.  I have the
 same shell I had before.  Also, "dEd" runs fine - but that
 is probably because of the different shell.  I asked Kevin
 Pease about that new "shell" - he said he didn't know where
 that came from.  Apparently Zack got an accidental "gift"
 from somewhere.

        Windows have a little quirk - changing colors on one
 window does it to all of them.  Kevin Pease has a fix,
 provided by a well known OS9 Guru - he said he would upload
 it very soon.

        I have heard of problems with MM/1's talking to
 printers, especially with long cables, but I was getting
 away with it up to now.  I had ribbon cables from the MM/1
 and a big ugly "386" running to switch boxes, and parallel
 cables from the boxes to the Epson and the Deskjet so I
 could switch either printer to either computer.  --- No
 more.  With the faster CPU, the MM/1 wants a short cable
 directly to the printer.  (I can live with it).

        The reason I haven't said a lot in the forum about my
 new toy is that it had this little problem -- every once in
 a while, especially after a cold start, it would trash the
 hard drive.  It seems there was this little timing problem
 that required some attention from Kevin Pease.  The good
 news here is the response I got on the problem.  I bought
 the upgrade at the "Blackhawk" booth in Atlanta, which was
 manned by Bill Whitman (another IMS rep).  When I decided
 something was wrong, I called Bill (put a message on his
 machine), and left CIS email for Kevin Pease.  BOTH of them
 called me at home within a day.  Both had suggestions and I
 tried them all - but finally had to send the insides of my
 machine to Kevin.  He tracked down the problem, made a new
 PAL to correct it, called to let me know he had it fixed,
 sent it back, and called me again today, just to make sure I
 had it running OK.

        As Delphi and CIS OS9 forum regulars know, response from
 IMS has, in the past, been..  well...  less than
 outstanding.  Paul Ward has not appeared on CIS or Delphi
 for many moons.  ((I think Frank Hogg ran him off.  Frank
 was mean to him.  Look ashamed, Frank.))(GRIN)

        David Graham (Blackhawk) (NIMITZ) has obviously been
 trying to correct the situation.  Although he was not at the
 Atlanta 'fest himself, David left his booth in good hands.
 I am very pleased with the 68340 and the quick technical
 support.

        Like Zack, I feel my money was well spent.  Get one.
 Check with David Graham (NIMITZ) for current price and
 delivery time.

ok, I will see if I can find the freeware source, I sent the source to NIMITX
oopps, make that NIMITZ, he is going to port it to the MM/1. The source I gave
him is the newest version, when he gets the MM/1 version going, he is going to
sell it, and the CoCo version (which includes a bunch of other stuff not in the
free version) I think I may have deleted the shareware source, since I am not
working on it anymore..yep, just checked not on my HD, I may still have it on

As far as I can tell, Chris has pretty much answered your questions but I'd like

Gee, I got it to pop out OK (I think).  At least it came out without any lha
errors.  I'm using edition #2 of lha but I could have used edition #11 of lharc
instead.  I do think I used lha since I use that unless I get and error with it,

then I would try lharc.  Anyway, I think I d/l'ed it to either a COMM directory
and used extractor (edition 10) or to root and just did lha -xv (cuz I like to
see what is going on).  Really forgot which I did but I did get it to unarchive.

I used sterm to d/l it.  Hope this helps.   Bob

I haven't picked up the Fax file yet, but I did run into that error message
recently.  I had to rebuild my CMDS dir from backups and wound up with an older
version of lharc.  Changing to a newer lharc made the errors go away.

 James,

 I successfully burst os9fax.lzh using version 2.06 of LHa.  Just used
 lha -x.

 I had problems with the earlier version of LHa - 2.01 I think.  Mostly it
 worked, but sometimes not.  I'm now using version 2.06, the latest, and it
 has worked flawlessly so far.  Went back and was able to burst files I
 wasn't able to burst previously.  This is on the SYSTEM IV (68000) and the
 SYSTEM V (68020).

     KWindow programming

  I was wondering. When making a KWindow program, can a hot spot be assgned a
menu item?? What I want to do is instead of having a pull down menu item, I want

to click on the menu item and have it execute the subroutine. Right now I have
to pull down the menu item and then have it call the subroutine. also can a pull

down menu call another pull down menu. Something like this is mentioned in
Kevin's KWindow Docs, but I'm a little fuzzy on how it is suppose to be done.

All you need to do is define the menu item with no elements. And when you are
finished doing your processing, do an _ss_ubar() to refresh the menu bar.

Well...perhaps more infuriating is to happen to get the phone number of a former

BBS, so first time, always dial manually, and if a human answers, be sure to
pass along to the place where you found the number that there's no longer a BBS
there.  I remember long ago dialing what I thought was a BBS number and getting
an elderly woman who was quite upset at getting a bunch of calls with modems at
the other end.

My 15V AC adapter for my 3-N-1 board just died.  I was actually using the AC
adapter for the DCM-5 modem which has the same voltage requirements.  Would
anyone have a spare DCM-5 modem power adapter they would be willing to sell?

Okay, can anybody tell me how to send E-mail using Fidonet thru Delphi? Mark

@datapage.com.  Delphi tells me invalid something or other. Any hints how to do
this???

I believe you mean Internet, not Fidonet.... but to answere your question, you
would use:
        IN%"mark@datapage.com"
as the To address from Delphis mail utility... note, you must be an Internet
subscriber on Delphi to send Internet mail from Delphi. Also... note that mark
does have a Delphi account (MARKGRIFFITH) so maybe you don't really need to send

to his other account?

     Coco conversion
     From: MROWEN01     To: DSRTFOX


     Well, I tore my TRS-80 4/p apart this weekend to look at putting a Coco 3
in it for my "luggable". The keyboard is very similar to the Coco. It's just a
bunch of micr switches and a 16 conductor cable. I haven't had time to compare
the keyboard matrix to see if it's even close to the Coco, but it looks like it
might be worth the trouble of wiring it for a Coco. I plan to just build a two
floppy portable and keep the hard drive in my big PC case system. Any idea where

I might dig up some tech data on the 4/P? I haven't dealt with Tandy for some
time. My local store can't even spell PC. They haven't been very helpful. I
suppose I should try a bigger town maybe. I specifically need to know how the
video hook up should work. I'm looking forward to your article on using the
XPander board. I'll keep you posted on my progress with this project.

Thanks -Mike Rowen

If the keyboard has a sixteen conductor cord, you can at the very least mount a
CoCo keyboard in the keyboard shell and use the existing cord. The video should
be pretty easy IF it is pure composite. It should have a single wire that is
sheilded going between the computer and monitor. If not, let me know what DOES
go between the computer and
 monitor or monitor circuit board and maybe we can figure it out.

All of the power and video connections appear to be made at one corner of the
motherboard. All wires are twisted pairs. I haven't actually pulled the 4/P
completely apart yet. It's difficult to see which wires are connected to
thevideo board. I'll have to pull the front cover off to see what's really going

on. I don't see any obvious shield wire. Perhaps a twisted pair is enough for
this short run. I'll look at it closer tonight. I'm also trying to get a tech
manual for the 4/P. I still haven't had time to compare the keyboard matrix to
the Coco 3. All of the key switches on the 4/P keyboard have accessable solder
points though. With a little work I can rewire the whole thing to work with a
Coco. I would imagine the video is composite too.

If the video appears to be twisted pair instead of shielded, it probably is
composite, as TP is fine for that type signal. You should be able to use it with

no problem, and Dennis says the keyboard also. I might have a diagram on
rewiring that keyboard.... at least I know I do for a Model I keyboard. Just
might be the same. Will try to remember to look it up and send you a copym,

I guess he knows you're waiting on hime then? I guess we need to know what kind
of signals the horizontal nad vertical are. They should be the same as for the
KayProII though. Just connect hor and vert to the same on the CoCo3 RGB port,
and use the Green signal for video.. or "OR" everything (R,G,& B) together like
was done for the KayPro monitor, through germanium diodes.

     Window descriptors
     From: ILLUSIONIST  To: ALL

Can someone tell me the offsets in a window descriptor for the forground,
background, border colors, x/y coordinates to make a window "full screen" also,
I want to make all my windows 80 col. white on black. Actually, I guess I just
really need to know the color info, since my /term and w7 are 80 col. white on
black, w7 is white on blue. Also, is there anyway to customize OS-9 start
PALLETES, I mean, the default registers dont contain any colors I really want,
white on black is boring, green foreground is annoying, and I dont like cyan..
:( I would really like to have a window with AMBER or orangish foreground color,

but there isnt a default color to do this, I guess it would be a mod. to CC3io,
any ideas?

Mike, take a look in the OS9 manual, tech reference section, pages 6-7 and 6-8.
Really, everything you need is on 6-8. This is a table of the meaning of each
byte in a SCFdescriptor. You'll be interested in COL, ROW, STY, CPX, CPY, FGC,
BGC, AND BDC. Those control how big, where it starts, what type, and the colors.

  Long, *long* ago, I patched my system to use different default colors. And,
yes, one of the foreground is amber. I'll have to dig out the info on where to
patch, though. Harass me if I don't get back to ya soon. :>

How many CoCo users out there in Delphiland have an HP DeskJet 500C or 550?

I have a huge 9-page poster size Mandelbrot set image that you can print out on
your color deskjet (it almost uses up an entire ink cartridge), cut & laminate
together and hang on your wall.  It's in 8 colors at 300 dpi for an effective
resolution of 7200 x 9000  (24" x 30").  Took about 2 CPU weeks to compute on my

spare COCO-3; the 9 files combined are about 4 MEG; to print out each page you
simple send the file straight to the printer - they're text files with the
graphics codes embedded (so come to think of it you don't even need a CoCo to
print them out ...)

I will not post them unless I get at least 3 responses to this because it would
take an entire Saturday afternoon to upload them at 2400 Baud.

that can spit out 3.5 1.44 meggers.. you might want to ask in the Desktop
publishing forum too, I doubt many cocoers will have 500c's but PC users, is
another story, I am sure more than 3 people on delphi would grab it, its a
matter of getting them to the right place, btw, is that 4meg ARCHIVED!! or in

     TermUI
     From: ILLUSIONIST  To: ALL

I was wondering how many CoCoers have terminals running to the ole' coco? I am
in the middle of writing a program called TermUI, its a Terminal User Interface.

So far it is hard-coded for vt100, but I plan on reading the control codes from
a file, that could support multiable terminal types, (could even run it on a
CoCo Text screen) anyway, the Microware TERMSET file just isnt good enough..it
doesnt support enough codes, I wanted to support multiable effects, so that say,

and ANSI Terminal could have all different colors on screen, while a vt100
terminal could just put the same control code in the different slots. anyway, I
was wondering about other terminal files, like curses, what kinda stuff does it
support? Or should I just go with termset and foresake the possiblity for
multiable colors for ANSI? the only reason I hardcoded it so far was to get the
code down, I will go back in later with GNU Emacs on my UNIX box to replace the
vt100 codes with codes gathered from the terminal file..any ideas?

BTW, if anyone wants a copy of TermUI hardcoded for VT100/102 let me know I will

send it to ya..in return, just let me know what you think, improvments etc..

Thank you Mike, I have a question.  My current setup uses a Disto SC-2 and a
Tandy RS-232 Pack.  I don't use the rs-232 port in the SC-2.  Would it be
possible to use both the Tandy RS-232 and Disto RS-232 port at the same time, so

as to have a dual port machine.  I seem to remember that it is possible to
change the address on one of these devices.

Yeah, you should be able to use both. Both ports are addressed at the same
location? If so, I think one or both could be modified, I never used either of
those pieces of hardware, so I dont know the exact method. Though I would think
that modifing the disto rs232 pak would be similar to modifing the Tandy pak.
You will also have to modify the mpi. (a procedure called "strapping") this is
all that should really be needed..plus of course, a new descriptor for the port
when the address is changed..

The Disto 3/4-n-1 and the Tandy pack do not collide. With a strapped mpi, you
should be able to use both ports with SAcia.mpi.

Hi,Br...
  I currently use BOTH in mine with os9 ..The Rs232 Rat pak is used as
 the Mouse...Rs232..Microsoft...the other is my main port from my H/d..+
 rs232 board in my SC-2.......has worked fine over the last couple of years! if
you use the SACI program for the Rs232 port..the XMODE program that came with
it..allows one to change the BASE address of the Discriptor module and the name!

Hmmm! come to think of it,I,m not sure on the name change!<grin> part....I use
Osterm on mine and changed the Hard coded locations to point to my NEW

WRONG! VERY WRONG....THEY are NOT addressed at the same location! the Tandy

 I use BOTH units in mine!<grin> I recomend doing the IRQ fix of mine! that
 is in the Database...all it does is connect the STD IRQ to the external Buss
 via pin 40 that is unused<used to be the Slect line><turns off the roms,and
 kills the MPI when another board like the old 68008 board did> one just cuts
 the trace going to the 74ls138 chip without cutting out the resistor..and
 rewiring the trace directly to IRQ.....the MPI als needs one trace cut!
 by doing this a lot of work is bypased,as the MPI has ALL pin 40,s joined
 together already....one now only needs to jumper a wire from pin 40 in the
 pack to the interupt line going to the 6551.....

Hi, Dennis -

The software fix ("gime toggle") helps to eliminate the need for the "IRQ diode
hack", but does not eliminate the need for the MPI strapping modification.

Without the strapping mod, the MPI circuitry blocks interrupts originating from
any slot other than the specific one selected. By default (stock setup), the
interrupt source is set to slot 1 by CC3Disk, so the RS232 pack normally goes
there.  A driver can change the interrupt source selection to different slot,
but this still leaves the other 3 slots unable to interrupt.

If I followed your description of your mod, it is a more sophisticated
alternative to the strapping mod (using already "strapped" pins 40 instead of
pins 8).  Nice touch, though it does require doing a minor mod to each pak that
generates interrupts.

Cheers... / Ken

yes! its real easy to change the address. lemme dig up my docs.

its probably far better to modify the rs232 pak from tandy. (easy to get at
things in there) Ok open up the pak. with the DB25 facing you look for the ROM
chip, towards you is the 74LS04 chip. You should see a trace coming from pin 8
of the 74LS04. (its the upper right pin) it heads for pin 2 of the SY6551 chip.
vcut this trace. now the remaining trace from pin 2 of the 6551, solder a jumper

to pin 9 of the 74ls04. That will change the base address from $FF68 to $FF6C.
You could also accomplish this by merely soldering together pin 8 & 9 of the '04

chip. What I did was add a single pole/double throw switch which allows me to
swap addresses on the fly. I also added a second switch for the IRQ to go to
either the CART line or to a screw terminal i made up for an IRQ hack. This is
my Spare pak, so i need to be prepared!

Hope that helps!

I uploaded the entire CoCo termcap code here a couple years ago.  Look in the
database for it.  Yes, termcap is pretty much unlimited, although the currently
defined parameters cover just about anything your could want. If you want to
know more about it, Nutshell books carries and excellent volume of termcap and
terminfo.

You would be MUCH better off using an existing standard for terminal control
rather than reinvent it yet again.  Too many people have done this and I'm tired

of adding yet another terminal config file to my system.

Just posting this out in the open...
One thing I think people want from K-Windows is a better keyboard
interface.  One that will allow all keys to be accessed uniquely.  (So
CTRL-M and ENTER are two distinct keystrokes, and the arrow keys be
unique from CTRL sequences!)  Another thing I would like to see, would
be a getstat to find out if the shift/ctrl/alt keys are depressed, so I
could handle SHIFT/CTRL/ALT-CLICK mouse combinations... this would add
greater functionality to some programs.  I've heard the argument that
applications shouldn't get that complex to require those, but sometimes
they just make sense.  (Like in Write-Right, it would be nice to have a
CLICK move your cursor to the mouse position, while a SHIFT-CLICK would
highlight text up to the current mouse position, much like MAX-10 and
Macintosh word processors do.)

Hey, how about a getstat for the current font!  :)

     From: THESCHU      To: ALL

 Here is some info for all you music buffs that use ANY of the music programs
for the COCO. At some of the Music stores throughout the country there is a new
system going up that you can print-up sheets of music or get 'Pro Midi' tm.
files ( MsDos & MacinTosh formats ) for your favorite music that may want to
have.
 How the system works is like this: 1) The system ask you for the title. 2) When

you find it( if on file in the system) you can play a portion of it. 3) Then
gives you the option for sheet music or Pro Midi files.
   > NOT FOR ALL FILES. Some are Pro Midi only. not sure about the
   > other way around thou. 4) Go pay for the Music sheets / disk and have fun.

  One thing that I am trying without success yet is to run a Pro-Midi file using

MMFplay (found on this Sig in Music) but the /Midi driver for the Seiral Port
founf
 Found in the New uploads section for this MFPlay util has a bad header ack when

i -IDENT- the drivers. This is prolonging my progress in making a final report
to the success of this venture.
  IF anyone has a GOOD /Midi Driver for the coco's Seiral Port Please
 Upload it for the use of all who need it.
  As for how to extract the MsDos Pro Midi files is easy.
 Just use PcDos ( found here ) thru the PcMenu program to copy a binary file to
OS9. Easy!!! Now I just NEED a Good /Midi driver to test it.

Yep... the file did have a LOT of padding. The actual file size whould be 132
bytes for midi.mod. It contains both the driver and descriptor merged
together... I corrected the file size in the database, so people in the future
who download it don't have to worry about the padding (unless they use x/y

Hi Zack!

Scribe is QWK packet reader.  QWK is a format that FIDO uses to collect
messagesoffline. It's main purpose is to save online time and long distance
charges.  Scribe allows you to read and reply to these messages on yi(your      
        )
own computer at home, thenupload any replies to the system that you collected
them from. If you don't have FIDO access, this program will do you no good.

A friend od (of) mine is writting a QWK collection program for use with StG.
Later this year, or earlier next year (whichever comes first), Scott G. will be
releasing Version 4 of StG.  It will run on OSK machines as well as Coco OS9
machines. In this case, if you have access to an StG site, then Scribe can be
used to read StG news offline.

Speeking of Zmodem, the latest version of Zmodem (3.24) is now functional for
OS-9 (Both CoCo and 68K versions). The CoCo version includes some assembly
optimization by Gene Heskett (WOAY) to speed up CRC calculation. Its definately
faster then previous versions (both sz and rz) Also, sz now uses buffered I/O on

writes, which will also add a further speed inprovement. I'll be uploading both
CoCo and 68k versions tonight/this weekend in both AR and LHA format.

Gene:

Are you having trouble with send or receive?  I d'loaded a file
with rz since the first of the month, with no problems.
But I've never ever been able to get sz to work -- I always get a
"waiting for patway nak" (whatever that means), until sz times
out and tells me to check the chapter on bugs.  Now the "chapter"
on bugs simply says that ASCII conversion (whatever that is) is
lousy, and doesn't work at all with sz. I took this to mean that
sz will never work.

So I pretty much use Xmodem for uploading, which never seems to fail.
Haven't tried Kermit.

Thats the first time I've heard of anybody having trouble with sz since
supercomm2.2 was released, which in fact appears to issue the command to sz
properly, something I have not had much luck with from the command line though.
And in this case, sz was working just fine, but a version of rz I've patched up
for v32.bis modem useage, and which has been working for a month just fine,
suddenly gets very intermittent. To make that story, after exiting here from
that message, I went back and dl'd 4 files from date new and the one thats been
stuck in my workspace for 2 days because I couldn't make *any* version of rz
I've got work.  Go figgur!, thanks for the reply, Cheers, Gene

Huh.  I've never had a problem with Sz.  I compiled it on my system and it works

just fine.  Maybe you need to recomplie.  Also, I'm not using the NIL addition.
I leave it out of my bootfile because it makes RZ and SZ freak out on my system
at 14.4.  Maybe if you're using NIL in your bootfile, you could try taking it
out.  Good luck!

Andy,
  Do you have rz & sz working at 14.4?  If so, how did you do it? Did you
compile sz with the 6309 patched RMA?  (I haven't patched my RMA for 6309 yet,
but I renamed RMA to asm for my C compiler) I'm interested in how your coco does

at 14.4.
  BTW I am thinking about putting a 36MHz crystal in my coco.  I just haven't
decided if the 12% increase over the present 32MHz crystal is worth pushing the
GIME and the cm8 too hard. :-)

Actually, I have my serial port locked at 19.2 and the modem deals with the DTE
speed stuff.  I just compiled it with the regular old libraries and it seems to
work just fine.  But I thought that the 6309 patches for RMA only allow it to
compile 6309 mnemonics.  The compiler would still have to generate the 6309
assembly instructions, correct?  I think Boisy may be working on something for
that.  But...back to the point...The CRC for my version of sz is 0DFDE8.  At
14.4 I get about 450+ CPS on receives.  Haven't measured Sz's speed cause the
local BBS I use doesn't give me a status report after an upload.  Just a note,
though.  Xmodem-1K receives are a whole LOT faster.  Almost 3 times as fast.

If I were you, I'd go for the 36 MHZ crystal if you can get your cm8 to sync at
that rate.  Since the 32 MHZ seems to be the difference between reliable 14.4
and unreliable 14.4 on my system, the 36 may make the difference for yours.

It seems they are hard to get and have had some support problems. I don't even

If you can actually provide the machines in a resonable amount of time, I'd say
a number of people will still buy them, considering the new software that is
coming out for the MM/1.  What sort of delivery times are you looking at?

I finally found the bug that has been plaquing me for 2 months. This bug is with

GrfInt in the bootfile I cannot use /w to do any window operations It totally
crashes the system. Well what i discovered it my /w1 descriptor is set to
type=01 (vdg) as soon as i placed it back as type=80 it worked! NOTE: with
WindInt, it would skip /w1 and use /w2. apparently windint is a little bit
smarter. It also made no difference if VDGInt was in memory or not. I originally

thought supercomm was at fault since it would crash the system when booted after

i removed WindInt from the boot. Well apparently GrfInt's coding isn't smart
enough to go around type 1 windows. Thought id pass this one on.

Randy,

I notice one pecular thing about supercomm. It grabs a lot of system ram.
accounting for the XTP value of sacia (for recieve buffer) and the extra path to

/NIL (VRN timing) it grabs 11 pages of ram for itself (not counting XTP value or

VRN) I even removed VRN and reduced the XTP value to see what happens. Why does
it grab so much system ram? is there anyway to make it less hungry for ram?

Mike, SuperComm is a user state program. It can not just grab extra system ram.
Even if it did, what in the world would it use it for? Without VRN, and using
the recommended "<>>>/w" startup, starting SC will cause three path descriptors
(main window, status window, serial port) to be created, and if SAcia wasn't
inited, it's static storage would also be allocated. Oh, and the process
descriptor for SC.

   Hmmm, it almost adds up. That's 9 pages, at an absolute minimum. I would
guess that your other two pages are going to extending one of OS9s internal
tables. Try starting up SC, quiting, and restarting, noting the change to system

ram with each move.

 BTW, I just started up a second SC n an un-inized port, and it took 10 pages,
including the VRN path. (VRN was already inized via first copy)

In my case it grabs 19 pages of system ram, 8 for sacia (because of the XTP
value) say 2 for the process descriptor, 2 for VRN, removing VRN and setting XTP

to zero (no buffer) it grabs 11. Im just trying to understand whats going on to
make sure it isn't a system problem. Using SMAP and PATHS to track it (Kevin's

     GHOSTSCRIPT
     From: EDELMAR      To: JOHNREED

 John,

 Update on my initial testing of 'ghostscript'.  But first understand I know
 nothing about Postscript nor Ghostscript.  I'm trying Ghostscript at the
 urging of Mark Griffith - the scoundrel <g>.  He has helped me, though.

 I got it up and running last night on my laser - a Tandy 950 supposedly HPLJ2
 compatible.  It seems to work ok.  Printed 'tiger.ps' and a couple other
 sample files.  I noticed 2 problems.  There appears to be some streaking
 in certain portions of the tiger.ps and golfer.ps printouts.  But this
 streaking did not appear when I ran cheq (from Adobe).  When I ran 'alphabet.
 ps', the characters in the first column were cut-off.  I checked the driver
 and found that the left margin was set for .02" instead of about .25".  I'll
 have to change that - means I'll have to break-down and get the GCC compiler.
 One other 'undocumented feature' - seems the letter 'A' is appearing on the
 upper left side on 'golfer.ps'.  Any ideas?

 I'm currently running the LOUT docs through GS.  The letter 'A' I mentioned
 above is appearing at the far left of the word 'ABSTRACT' (on the title page
 of each document).  Otherwise, the print-out appears to be going well.

 Couple of questions - Is there a way to print only 'odd' and then 'even'
 pages?  And can a specific page or range of pages be printed?   (I haven't
 gone through the docs thoroughly, yet).

 Some performance and other info which may be of interest.  I'm running
 ghostscript on a SYSTEM V (68020 @ 33 MHz) with 16 Megs of memory under
 G-WINDOWS.  A page print-out is taking between 2 and 8 minutes.  The double
 column pages taking the longest time.  In addition to the 560k 'gs' requires,
 'gs' is using 1.9 Megs of memory.  Most of the time the cpu is loafing.  The
 G-WINDOWS cpu monitor shows a usage of only 20% most of the time rising to
 about 90% only when the fonts are loaded at the beginning of each page.

 Ed

 Addendum - Thought about the speed - changed the priority of Gulted in the cpu
usage going to 100% and speeded up printing substantially.
 The document I'm printing has 50+ pages.  GS errored out (non-recoverable
 error) at page 40.  How do I restart where the printing left off?

 resulted in the cpu usage going to 100% and speeded up printing substantially.
 The document I'm printing has 50+ pages.  GS errored out (non-recoverable
 error) at page 40.  How do I restart where the printing left off?

    That sounds like something in the printer init lines at the beginning
    of each page is not quite right for your printer.  I think you are
    right -- time to get the GCC compiler.  The source has several examples
    of IBM-type display drivers too -- you should be able to come up with
    a pretty good screen display for your SYSTEM V if you want it.  I got
    the gswin.exe version to run on my cobbled-up "386" machine, and the
    display is very good on a monochrome vga screen.

    The only way I have been able to select pages is by adding the "%d"
    in the -sOUTPUTFILE= option like `-sOUTPUTFILE=loutdoc%d' -- this
    will produce separate files, loutdoc1, loutdoc2, and so forth.  Then
    send them to the printer in the order you want -- I have been playing
    with some BASIC routines to take a list of files like that and print
    them in the proper order - it will become a C program later.  I am
    a PostScript novice myself, but I'm sure there is a way to write a
    header in PostScript that would do it.  I think I saw some "page
    selecting" utilities in the PostScript Roundtable (PSRT) on Genie.

    One thing that speeds up Ghostscript is to compile the fonts into
    it. (Or at least the most common ones).  I have done this with the
    basic font set that comes with the Adobe Type Manager - but I can't
    upload that version - instructions for doing that are in the version
    2.6.1 upload.  I got the Adobe Type Manager at a local discount
    appliance store real cheap.

     Ultimuse3 Patches
     From: THESCHU      To: ALL

There was a message on my E-Mail that I kinda-sorta deleted from ( I Think) from

Martial about patches   for Ultimuse3 under 6309 Native - PowerBoost and Nitro 0
9
( Ihave not tested it under nitro, but someone else had used about the same
patch as I did). Here is the word. You should be able to apply the patch for ver

4.80 since that didn't realy change up untill v4.90. This patch is needed only
if you have the - 6309 with powerboost -.
 and you want to run Ultimuse3 in native - powerboosted systems.
 For any more info send me some E-Mail to > THESCHU <.

     rz/sz 3.24 for CoCo
     From: MITHELEN     To: ALL

For those that downloaded the new CoCo version of rz/sz 3.24 from the database,
I forgot to tell the compiler to give "sz" some extra memory to avoid stack
overflow errors. If you get stack overflow errors when you try to run sz, then
try puttine a #8k at the end of the command line. I'll be uploading a new
archive 11/8/93 that will have the "fixed" version.

Ok, I got the new archives for rz/sz up to Delphi. The new CoCo version should
fix the stack overflow problem that was reported to me. For those that already
doenloaded the CoCo version, and don't want to have to download the whole
archive, you can use DeD to patch the amount of data space allocated by
changeing Offset $0C to $49 (This is for "sz", rz should be OK) Don't forget to
verify CRC after makeing the patch...

Dear Friends: I just installed the new RZ and SZ modules.  RZ works fine.  I

I just tried uploading a file with Supercomm using SZ. So far no luck. I get a
window within SUpercomm, it asked for a filename.  I typed it in hit enter, and
the name erased.  I did this under the File send, external Zmodem
command.....What am I doing wrong?

I just got the latest 268'm.  Very nice as always.  I was wondering, is there a
source yet for the pc board you mention in the 2nd issue for the Puppo IBM
keyboard interface?  (I must confess the main reason I subscribed was to be able

to build one, BUT I am glad I did for everything else!)
  Please let me know if the board is available!
 Thanks,
