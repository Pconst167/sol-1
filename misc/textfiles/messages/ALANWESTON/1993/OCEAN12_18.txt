David,
    Thanks for the info. I see that some testing on different systems
will definitely need to be done. However, I would think that the problem
should be of no consequence to me, since the first thing I do is take a
base sample of the joystick values so that any character movement will
occur relative to the original values coming in from the port. As long
as the port is active and works the program should compensate for any
difference in returned values.
    We shall soon see.
...Eric...

YIKES!!  I DID mail it during December - and at the beginning of the
month.  That means it was competing with my monthly personal newsletter
and Christmas planning.  Oh dear!  Wait!  I still have an affinity for
using my stamp affixer gadget, so forgetting stamps won't be very
likely.  Okay, now I feel sure I remembered the stamp!    :)
On the other hand, if it doesn't arrive by 12/20/93, I'd like to know so 
I can alert the dead letter office!  (*shudder*)     Malcolm

It is in more than just that trade mag.  The Ad Man at Microware has an 
interesting sense of humor ("great embedd").
 
It touts the 68040 VME board.  I assume it operates with "lesser" 
processors in the family.  Looks like the 68K family is going embedded 
while the PowerPC 6xx family is going to get all of the glory at both 
IBM and Apple.  I requested the info on the PowerPC from Moto.  It <is> 
interesting but sad for the 68K.

*** Attention all RiBBS and related programmers ***
 
Charles West, Wes Gale, Norman Rheaume, Bill Wittman
and any others that have contributed.
 
The OSK/BINK/KBBS group is looking for compatable program
sources that can be ported to the OS9-68K system.
 
External programs such as bundle, unbundle, cparslst,
nodeprocess, autofrl, rtick, ltick, looknode, getmsgs etc.
are needed along with programs for creating menus, creating
a userlog and editing same. Also needed is all normal BBS
msg handling, archiving, tossing etc programs that I have
missed. Note that these program names are RiBBS names and
their counterpart in other BBS systems can also be considered.

Program sources in C are preferable but basic09 and assem.
may be used as long as they are documented sufficiently to
assist the programmer doing the port.

At present there is a port of Binkley being implemented
and it is intended to use Binkley as the mailer portion.

All authors that contribute will be noted in the docs for
the new OSK BBS.  It is to be a public domain release and
will be designed to run on any OS9-68K platform.

Please contact me, Warren Hrach at the Ocean Beach BBS
(619) 224-4878 Fido net/node 202/343, 12, 24, 9600 baud v.32b.
or by mail, 4369 Newport Ave. San Diego, CA 92107.
Contributions can be on 3.5" 720K OS9 format disks or 1.4 meg
OS9-68K format. 5.25" OS9 360K disk format also acceptable.

This msg. crossposted on OS9, RIBBS and MM1_TECH Fido echos.
If someone will post on Delphi and/or Internet it will be 
appreciated.
