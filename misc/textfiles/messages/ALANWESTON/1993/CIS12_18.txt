Carsten,

I'm maintaining a large software project written prior to the Ultra-C releases
and I'm supposed to convert it to Ultra-C to put make it compliant with ANSI C.

The last time I checked in here I heard bad things about Ultra-C, so I held
off.  Now I see that Gnu-C is working with OS-9 and supports srcdbg, which I
certainly need.  And Ultra-C doesn't seem to be getting better.

What's the best way to get Gnu-C and its documentation ?  I'd like to be able
to compile and link on my 486DX DOS machine and then download to the OS-9
machine, but I can do the development completely on the OS-9 machine if there
is no cross-compiler available.

I can use ftp.

Thanks,

Bill

Hello Carsten.

EFFO is European Forum For Os9. Their site is called 'lucy' in Switcherland.
The guy who ported GCC to OSK is called Stephan Pashedag. You will notice when
executing 'gcc2' with help-option. If you have 'gcc' v 1.42 you will also have
the email-addr. for Stephan.

Thanks for the info!

It is difficult for me to actually run the compiler under OS-9 as my OS-9
system (a CDI605 development player) only has one floppy and no hard disk (I
guess I could emulate a test CD with GNU on it...).

We have been using (a somewhat questionable) GNU 2.2.2 for OSK ported by
another person (Bruce Robertson).

I will try to 'grep' through the gcc2 executable for email address.

Is the FTP site called 'lucy.ch'?

Again thanks for the info, and if anyone does locate the source/diffs please
post a note here.

(If I find them I will upload (the diffs) here and to cabrales.cs.wisc.edu)

I am having a problem getting GNU C to work. Anytime I compile a program which
includes stdio.h, it tells me that there is an unterminated string or character
constant on line 326 of stdio.h. It is the unaltered header file which came in
the defs archive. I have searched through it around line 326 and cannot find a
problem. What's wrong here?

I copied all of the header files into /dd/defs and the ones in the SYS
directory to /dd/defs/sys. Is that right? And I have removed all of the header
files from the MW C compiler. Is that right?

Hmmmm, the "stdio.h" that I have in /dd/defs/ is the same one that came with
the MW compiler (78 lines long) - and I use it with GCC. I did add a #ifndef
_STDIOH_, #define _STDIOH_ ((original file)) #endif ("don't call it twice") .

There is ANOTHER "stdio.h" in "/dd/defs/CC/, and right at line 326 it has one
of those C++ comment lines starting with "//" instead of "/*". That C++ comment
line right at the place you describe is too much of a coincidence -- gotta be
the problem.

The /dd/defs/CC directory was created by the archive when I got the first
version of GCC and GPP.  I THINK (?) it only gets used by the gpp C++ compiler.
There is an option "-+" in the cccp pre-processor to handle those funny
comments.

Thanks for the info! Brian White on the COCO BITNET list beat you, though.
Seems that the defs files in the CC directory are used only by GPP, and are not
used by GCC, you just use all the same headers which came with the MWC
compiler.

I am now having linker problems, though, several modules which look to be
standard library modules not being found. Can post a specific list of modules
if that would help.

Two quick things come to mind (I recall a similar problem!):

1. Do a 'count stdio.h -b' to make sure that there are no $0As in the
   the file.

2. Are there any C++ type comments (//) in the file? The current version of
   GCC does not appear to like C++ style comments.

If this doesn't help, could you include a few lines from before the error in a
message...might twig something. Could be that are using a defined type which
hasn't be defined????

                Sync on green video comes with 15 pin IBM adaptor

Will this monitor work with an MM/1? I remember seeing a mention to the effect
that: "31.5 khz horizontal scan is not supported by current software." I also
know about the RAMDAC pin 5 disconnect fix.

Can someone give me some insight on this?

 I talked to Ed Gresick today.   I've said before, and still feel, that while
 GWindows is not appropriate as the standard windowin system on a personal
 system, that it is advantageous for it to be available on any OSK platform.
 So, Ed has  agreed to keep his offer open for 2 more months, until February
 28th, 1994.  Thanks, Ed!
 This is especially important to me, as I wish GWindows to be available as an
 OPTION, for programmers, though I will continue to support KWindows, and work
 for it's continued growth.     Good luck with getting those 20 orders Ed!

 The following is my response -

 I wish to confirm David Graham's (NIMITZ) statement regarding extending
 my offer to port G-WINDOWS to the MM/1 until February 28, 1994 in message
 #84126.  I'm willing to do this since Dave has endorsed G-WINDOWS as an
 optional windowing/GUI system for the MM/1.  Unless I hear otherwise from
 the individuals who have already ordered G-WINDOWS, I will keep their
 orders open on the books.

 I appreciate Dave's endorsement and believe this will result in neccessary
 additional orders.

Sb: GWINDOWS for the MM1
Fm: Frank Hogg of FHL 70310,317
To: all

GWINDOWS NOW AVAILABLE FOR THE MM1

Background: Last year I announced the availability of
GWINDOWS for the MM1 provided a certain number of orders
were received. I did not get the orders and therefore
dropped the project. Enter Ray Tremblay of Repengny
Quebec. In November of '92 he bought the TC70 version
of GWINDOWS after successfully patching the demo
version to work on his MM1. We discussed using his
patches and offer it to the MM1 users. I decided not
to do this at that time for various reasons.

Fast forward 1 year. A short time ago Delmar offered
to port GWINDOWS to the MM1 if 20 orders were received.
He has not gotten that many and has inferred that he
would drop the project. Many who had placed orders
expressed sadness about this and that got me thinking.

 Sooo... First I called Mike Smith of Hazelwood who
owned the port to the TC70. I suggested that because
the TC70 was history. And that we were not likely to
do a video board with the VSC.  He would not mind the
good will gained by giving the source of the driver to
MM1 users so that they might 'fine tune' the port for
their own use. It took some talking but he was convinced
to do this if the source was not freely distributed
beyond those MM1 owners who bought GWINDOWS. Next I
called Ray and because Mike was not charging for the
source he decided to give away his work also. However
GWINDOWS is a licenseed product and there is cost
involved even if a full blown port is not done.

Here are the details. The package includes the complete
TC70 version of GWINDOWS with manual. Plus you get the
source of the driver for the VFC. Plus you get the patches
that Ray did to make it work on the MM1. Because of the
generosity of Mike Smith of Hazelwood and Ray Tremblay
we can offer GWINDOWS for only $150.

Caveat: Neither FHL or Hazelwood have access to a MM1.
At this price we could not offer updates or support even
if we did have access to a MM1. By providing Rays patches
and the driver source we expect MM1 users to be self
sufficient and to share improvements/enhancements to the
driver/port among themselves. This is not a supported port
of GWINDOWS like those for the KiX but it will provide you
with a complete working version of GWINDOWS for your MM1
and allow you to develop software for GWINDOWS.

Availability: Ray is emailing the patches to me this
weekend (12/17/93) and Mike is shipping the source next
week. Once those are in my hands I can ship GWINDOWS.
Possibly by Christmas.

I hope you understand and appreciate the generosity of
Mike Smith of Hazelwood and Ray Tremblay who have made
this possible without compensation.

Sb: FHL G-WINDOWS OFFER
Fm: Ed Gresick 76576,3312
To: ALL

 Reference message from FHL (#19492) offering his old TC70 G-WINDOWS package
 including source for the driver.  I think the following facts are important
 to those considering his offer.

 1.  I believe the edition number of the Hazelwood package is 37.  The
     current release is edition #50.  Significant changes, mostly enhance-
     ments but several bug fixes also, occurred since the release of edition
     37.  Most of the important changes resulted in the release of edition
     45 late last year.  While not as significant, edition 50 (just released)
     includes additional changes.  As I recall, several of the changes did
     effect the driver.

 2.  While the source code to the driver may be included, unless the programmer
     has the associated *.a, *.l and *.h files, he will be unable to compile
     the driver unless he constructs his own files.  These files are quite
     involved.  The *.a, *.l and *.h files are proprietary files to GESPAC/
     Steve_Adams and the language in my licensing agreement prohibits me from
     giving or selling these to anyone.  I assume the same is true of any
     other agreement GESPAC/Steve_Adams are parties to.

     Further, without the portpack manual, almost 200 pages, it will be diffi-
     cult for a programmer to be certain he has implemented all of the required
     functions correctly.  Attempting to deduce this from source code is time
     consuming and difficult.  Again, this document is proprietary.

 3.  It was stated that this would be an unsupported package.  DELMAR supports
     all products we sell whether hardware or software.  Support for the
     G-WINDOWS ports to the SYSTEM IV and SYSTEM V computers continues for
     1 year after purchase at no cost to the customer.  When edition 45 of
     G-WINDOWS was released, I sent updates to all purchasers of G-WINDOWS at
     no charge (except shipping to overseas customers).  Since the changes in
     edition 50 are not significant, I'm not providing automatic updates but
     all new sales (including the proposed port to the MM/1) will be with the
     latest edition.  To emphasize, a port to the MM/1 will receive the same
     support provided our other customers.

 4.  Frank Hogg states "... and allow you to develop software for GWINDOWS."
     This is wrong.  To develop software for G-WINDOWS you will require the
     'developers pak'.  Regardless of the source, it is an extra charge
     (unless the seller wishes to absorb the cost charged by GESPAC/Steve_
     Adams).

 5.  I believe that releasing the source code to the driver can be a disaster.
     Without full knowledge of what is expected of the driver by G-WINDOWS,
     different flavors of G-WINDOWS can appear which may be incompatible with
     each other and main stream ports of G-WINDOWS.  Further, as new editions
     of G-WINDOWS are released and software is written and/or updated under
     the later editions, there is no assurance that the software will be
     compatible.  An example is ControlCalc (from RTware).  The version being
     sold today requires G-WINDOWS edition 45 or higher.  IMO, if users cannot
     be assured of obtaining the latest version of G-WINDOWS and cannot be
     assured of continued support for G-WINDOWS, they are probably better off
     without it.

 One serious problem the CoCo community has and is facing are all the unsup-
 ported patches, 'improvements', etc. to the OS and software.  Thus far, OSK
 has not suffered from this problem nor do I think we need to start now.  If
 Hazelwood/FHL want to offer G-WINDOWS for the MM/1 - fine, I have no problem
 with that.  But it should be a port of the latest edition to insure compati-
 bility across all platforms and be fully supported.
