Fm: Frits Wiarda 71553,3104
To: ALL

I am looking for a fork() function on OS9 with works the same way as fork()
on any UNIX system works. This means when you call fork() a copy of your
process is created. In the old proces, fork() returns the process ID of the new
process. In the new process, fork() returns zero.

As far as I know, the way I create child processes in OS9 is not POSIX
compatible.
Is there perhaps a POSIX compatible release of OS9 planned?

Frits -

I believe _someone_ wrote a unix fork (Bob Larson?) function, but it's not
native to the delivered OS9 libraries. While I work in both domains (OS9 &
Unix), I always felt that the OS9 method made more sense. Example - you want to
fork a child process, that is not the same as yourself (i.e. 'dir' want to fork
'more'):

  OS9:
       os9fork more
       done


  Unix:

      fork self
      am I self?
        yes - do nothing
        nope - I'm child - exec more
     done

If you don't have access to the larson library additions (possibly on the OS9
server at cabrales), why not just conditionally compile the code for OS9/Unix?

Pete,

Thank you for your response. The reason I am looking for a POSIX compatible
fork() is that I want to be able to port programs written for any POSIX
compatible
system to OS-9. I do not want to edit the source code if possible.

You said there is probable something like that in the "Larson library". What is
this library? What do you mean with "The OS9 server at Cabrales"?

The Larson library is a unix-like collection of functions that was created for
the same need you're looking to fill.

The CABRALES system is a FTP server on the internet that wherehouses OS9 tools,
sources, and text files.

Steve Wegert, a Sysop here, has a system that mirrors the Cabrales site, and
may be able to easily nab the library for you. Blarslib.ar or something that is
the name.

Can you make a small change to the Blars1.lzh archive.  There's a major bug in

Frits,
 OS9 does not have a unix fork(). What Pete is alluding to here by Bob
Larson is just an empty function call:

       fork()
       {
       }

If the Unix code does _not_ follow with an exe* function, then some port
work needs to be done.

Bob Larson has a partial unix compatibility library on cabrales.

Yeah.  Guess I shouldn't whine, but it isn't obvious why it is better to
obsolete the commands I am used to and make me learn a new set.  I just
typed RM and it barked at me again.  How many years have I been typing
RM?  Hope it doesn't take that long to relearn....

Thanks.  I filed this one.  I never take the time to sit down and learn
the more esoteric features.  I just had an experience with that.  Trying
to figure out how to forward the bounced mail to you, I READ it.  After
a screen full or two it became obvious that I wasn't going to get a
stop/continue message.  Control P didn't break it either.  I thought I
used to use that for break, but it didn't work today.  So I go looking
for some dox.  I scanned 60 pages of forum docs without any luck.  Of
course by then it had listed 50K of lpr.uue at 2400 baud, so it didn't
matter.  Perhaps I should take up gardening.....

This is seriously bizarre.... I tried rtn;ns three times that day and even
checked the log file to make sure I hadn't typoed it.  Today it works again.
Go figger.  I guess it must be black magic or the phase of the moon or

Dear  Friends, I am looking for your help to solve our problem! I work at SEPA,
an Italian electronic company, in the Image Processing department. We are
currently involved in a large european robotic project, where I'm the
responsible for the Vision part. The system we have used to develop our
algorithms is composed of some Image Processing boards (Digicolor, Roi-Store,
Vfir-MkII from DATACUBE), one INMOS B014 board with 6 T800 transputer module
plugged onto it and a SUN3E as CPU and VME bus master running UNIX as Operating
System. Everything worked perfectly.

Unfortunately, we have been convinced to change this architecture in order to
cope with the real-time problems of a real application. As UNIX is not a
real-time operating system, we have decided to use OS9 and conseguently we have
replaced the SUN3E board with the MOTOROLA MVME147-SA-1. The big problem now,
is that we don't have the software drivers both for the DATACUBE boards and for
the INMOS one, as the two companies don't support this operating system.
Actually Datacube supported it once, but not anymore, so that they provided us
a partial set of source codes, leaving the work to test and debug them, to us.
However Inmos was not able to give us anything and we are really in big
troubles as we don't know where to start to solve the situation. I apologize to
have bothered you with my sad story, but now you represent my last hope.

If you should ever heard about someone using OS9 with DATACUBE and/or INMOS
boards, please, let me know how to contact them : I will greatly appreciate
your help! Thank you very much!

Just had a terrible thought that something was broke...but it doesn't appear to

        This is a \u+undeline\u- test.

And printed it out to file. Using dump shows that the word 'underline' is
prefaced by a $1b,1 and postfixed by a $1b,0. If it had gone to the printer it
would have been underlined. For a single letter, you just surround the letter
with a \U+ and \U-. Of course, it's easier to put the prin the environment
file. Did you test this with mvef?

what about a true C++ comp? Please let me know anything about it.

        We are using a 68040 in our system and I believe we have the ssm
installed.  I am going to try modifying the programs so that they will print a
message and exit.  Currently we have the programing printing a message and then
continuing on.  We never receive the message on the screen, I believe this is
because the program crashes before the system has a chance to print the
message.

Hello Ferranti Tech.

if you have the 'ssm' in the bootfile/memory and it is installed in the
'init'-module, you will get 102-errors it you try to access memory out the
range, your task is granted during runtime. In attempt to troubleshoot your
problem, do the following:

out-comment the 'syscache' in the init-module(use 'moded') and before starting
the task, call 'rombug'(I do hope you use that to 'bootstrap' with) and enable
it(you must have autoboot disabled). then issue the following command to
'rombug': ovu2<cr> this will make rombug monitor any bus-errrors in
system/user-mode and if it catches any 'bus'-errors then you will get a 'big'
register-dump and a lot of information, but in order to make it informative,
you must disable 'syscache', because the 68040 has executed quite a number of
instructions in its internal cache, before the external 'timeout/bus-error'
occurs. You should be able to determine which instruction caused the problem.
It is likely to be some register-indirect addressing like :  move.b (a3),d0 and
the value of a3 gives you the address in error. It is also possible to let
'rombug' monitor all the vectors and watch the result(remember that os9 is
using some for 'syscalls'). If this does not give you a key, then you must
point some more out about what your program is doing: system/user-state, driver
written in 'C' - which gives you a problem with 'stack' in system-state(only 4k
granted from 'kernel') which mean you must assign local memory for your stack
!!

hello Allan.

Did I say outcomment 'ssm', I ment 'syscache', as the information from 'rombug'
has shown to be hard to decode, with caching on. When you say performance
suffers 5 times, that wright for a running program, but when trying to catch
this buserror, it will help. It could also be a programming error that goes
away with caching disabled, and then you are half way finding the error.

If you ask Ole, he'll tell you that I'm the king of the 102 error. In most
cases my problem was in poor coding <grin>...what would run fine on one system
but would report 102s when run on a box with ssm. In 90% of the cases it was
the fault of passing a NULL pointer to a library string function. For example,

        char s1, s2;    /* global variables */

        if(strcmp(s1,s2)==0) foo();     /* foo() if strings the same */

would fail. This was a result of having s1 or s2 pointing to a dynamically
allocated string. In all cases I've had to change the code to something like

        if(s1 && s2 && strcmp(s1,s2)) foo();

Note that even this will cause a 102 if s1 is NULL:

        if(*s1 && s1) ...

However

        if(s1 && *s1) ...

will work.

Hmmm, you might try debug instead of srcdbg and see if that catches the error.
At least with debug you could determine the point of the error.

Could be that they needed a new srcdbg just for the fact that they don't have

Fm: Chris Burke 72240,304
To: ?

Here's a quick patch to the XSM assembler, to fix a problem related to the
BAND, BOR, and other bit manipulation instructions. Versions of XSM previous to
2.04 will generate code for the "A-register" when the "B-register" is specified
in the source code. For example, BAND B.4,FOO.2 produces code as if it were
written BAND A.4,FOO.2. You can fix this by searching your version of XSM for
the sequence below, and replacing the byte 03 with the byte value 04.

OLD SEQUENCE:

8C000127EA8C000227E98C000327E916FFE1

NEW SEQUENCE:

8C000127EA8C000227E98C000427E916FFE1

You'll also have to correct the CRC.

As a side note, XSM now can generate S-record output in addition to OS9 and
RS-DOS binary, and it has a symbol table of up to 64K. You can get the current
version, 2.04, as an upgrade from Burke & Burke.

Thanks to David Breeding for pointing out the problem with BAND.

Dear Friends, The following is a forum message from Delphi, uploaded with

72719 12-MAR 23:08 General Information
     Level III: Are We Ready Yet?
     From: THETAURUS    To: ALL

    To say that OS9 Level II has matured since it's release from Tandy is an
understatement. Since it's release, the somewhat clumsy looking level II has
piece by piece been patched, rewritten, and hacked at, and now a few years
older, has really begun to let it's true potential shine with those
modifications that Tandy preferred not to pursue. Level II is now, quite a
slick system with those patches, new drivers and descriptors, and other
modifications installed. Not only is this true with Level II but with Color
Computer hardware itself. We have seen quite a few neat developments come down
the line since we entered the orphanage, too many to even list here. I know
this is old news to many of us so I should just make my point. As great an
improvement this has been there is a downside. The confusion and possible
incompatibilities involved with all those modifications that are available is a
major turn off, not only for any newcomers or novices in the community, but
even the system veterans tend to have problems keeping everything together. As
far as solving this problem, I think that Farna Systems 'PatchOS9' is a step in
the right direction, but in my opinion I think it's about time to move ahead
and decide on our OWN Level III. This is a long time to go without an upgrade
and since it is beyond unlikely that either Tandy or Microware would have any
part of such a process, it is about time we take this upon ourselves.  We have
a lot to work with, and with a little more work on some of the modules and
hardware, a good long thought out voting process, and working alongside other
online users from CIS,Fidonet, and the Internet, as well as offliners possibly
through the various OS9 magazines and newsletters, and also working with the
various vendors, this could very likely be done. What would make this better
than having it done by Tandy or Microware<yes BETTER. Even tho it won't happen
anyway>? WE WILL DECIDE what is best for our computer and Operating System as a
community. Since we are the ones who held it up for so long, and since we are
carrying it into the future, we undoubably know what is best better then
anyone. Why do I think this is necessary? Because it makes things much easier
and more flexible for both Programmers and End users without the hassle of
making a million different modifications just for a program to work with an
operating system that has many different versions. Programmers are unwilling to
go through all this, and no one can blame them.

    How will we go about doing this legally? It will be simple actually. At
least if my idea works out<G>. Once Level III is finally decided on<which I
will guess will take a good amount of time>, it would be distributed on a
similar disk such as the 'PatchOS9' disk I previously mentioned. Hopefully one
or more of the vendors would offer the service of installing these patches once
the user sends his original master disk. The disk would contain all the patches
and Modifications that would be installed on the original LEVEL II two disk.
And the result would be LEVEL III. Then people advertising their programs could
simply say 'Level III' required. I would like to know how you all think we
should go at this? I think my ideas are valid and the 'PatchOS9'd disk brings
us very close. The only thing we would need to do is finish making whatever
modifications we feel are still necessary<new drivers,etc>,try and get as much
of that unofficial upgrade that hasn't been released yet as possible, and then
decide on the hardware standards. I think now is a good time to start this
subject as we have waited to long. It is time to end the confusion and
obstacles of sticking to a system this old.

    I am glad I brought this up now, since recently we have begun once again
talking about the feasibility of deciding on a Standards Committee. Such a
committee would prove VERY instrumental in this process. We do need an official
group to look up to, since at this time it really seems like we have only
ourselves to pat on the backs<G> and someone in a leadership position, maybe
thru the voting process would help boost moral activity<ok we won't give them
TOO much power<G>. We definately have some GREAT people here supporting us in
the community<vendors,magazine publishers,etc..>, but unfortunately it is very
hard for them too keep in consistent contact with their community with so much
work to do. That would be ANOTHER job where the Committee will come in handy.
The 'deafening silence' that seems to be in the community right now doesn't
mean doom. It's far from it actually, but there is just no comittee of
community representatives to pull us all together, and in our case we need
that. We are too big not to have it :)

    Looking forward to some creative response to this long winded blast ;)
       See Ya!
       >Chris<


Chris asked me to upload this wherever I could. Please feel free to post this
on any BBS or Pay-Systems you care to. Whether or not any of the folks who
worked on the ill-fated Upgrade will be able or willing to participate is
unknown at this time. There is talk of people contributing to fund to bring out
that upgrade. (A couple of $100.00 pledged so far) I will be glad to echo any
replies back to Chris on Delphi.

Larry, I think you are confusing low level paths and high level file pointers.
Be very careful in programming if you use things like the cgfx library (which
uses low level write()s) and fflush(), printf(), etc. Best, IMHO, to use one or
the other...not both. In most of my applications I make heavy use of sprintf()
to format stuff into memory and then use my own buffered routines (which use
writeln() and write()) to do the output. I may be duplicating the FILE
stuff...but at least that way I can keep track.

Bob,
  I think you were sending the tip to me, instead of Mike. I havn't messed with
getting & outputing data much till now. I'm at the point now where I need to
learn the best way to communicate with the user of the program, through the
keyboard. I have just been writing point & click routines for use with the
mouse. This is easy, because the program only needs to check the pointer
location and whether the button is up or down. But now I need to get some text
input from the user, and you have no idea what they may enter, so you have to
check for every possible case.
  You may be right about mixing high and low level io, I'm probably guilty of
that now.

One easy way to get user input is with gets(),  it allows them to edit the line
before they hit enter.  Then you can check the string once it's read in.

low level I/O, (path numbers), and high level I/O, (FILE *), are one of the
hardest things to get straight at first, but once you understand them, you've
got 'em for life. :)

Mike,
  I have been mainly using gets(), but how do you handle a case where for
example you open a box with 3 lines by 15 characters, where the user is asked
to enter a 10 character maximum name. The user starts entering characters and
doesn't stop at 10 but enters 16, which promptly scrolls the top line out of
the window. The program doesn't have any way of knowing what characters or how
many have been entered, until the return key is pressed.
  I want to change the routines I have now, so I can get 1 character at a time
and then act on what is being entered.

Hmmm. you SURE STDOUT is defined in <stdio.h>?  Normally 'stdout' is defined
but not STDOUT.  Lemme explain the difference.

stdin, stdout and stderr are of type FILE *.  They are buffered.

#define STDIN   0
#define STDOUT  1
#define STDERR  2

Are path numbers.  They are unbuffered paths to the 3 paths that all process
inherit when open.  On path numbers you can do certain things, on FILE *
(pointers) you can do others.

FILE *'s you can use fprintf(), fputs() and all the other functions starting
with f.

On paths, you use read(), write(), readln(), lseek().  Don't mix up FILE *'s
and path numbers.  They are simular but very different.

Does this make sense?

  If you look in your dd/defs directory at the file stdio.h you will find
something like the following:

   /*  the following are fake pointer variable defintions  */
   #define stdin    (&_iob[0])
   #define stdout   (&_iob[1])
   #define stderr   (&_iob[2])

You can then use any as a path or FILE *

Hope this helps
Bob

The Krider library is for 6809 only. I don't think you'll need it for OSK.

I don't believe that the sources for Carl's library were ever released.
However, the binaries are here. Check lib 10?

BTW, care to share what kind of application you are working on? Just for

Stephen, somewhere around here (I think at work on the MM/1) I have some docs
stripped from some Amiga source, which give one format of the Tracker MOD
stuff.  (There is no "official" MOD format; there are lots of enhancements and
minor diffs.)

The Amiga can play those files easily because they were created just for the
hardware capabilities of the Amiga... in this case, four DMA audio channels
with hardware looping, volume control, and freq control, merged into two output
channels.  All that has to be simulated on other systems (altho the stereo DMA
on the MM/1 aids some). - kev

Mark G. is the sterm expert (he wrote it...). However, do you have the shell
variable MODEM set? It should contain the name of the port to use. Otherwise,
use the command line "sterm -l /port" with "port" being "t0" or whatever.

Ya shouldnn't need any chickens for this. However, do you have a goat?

What version are you running?  It should appear on the startup screen at the
top.  Version 1.5 is, I believe, the only one made that will correctly run on
the System IV.  Also, does a baud rate show for the port when Sterm comes up?
Does the modem TR or DTR light come on? If you are not using the -l option from
the command line to specify the port, is the envrironment variable MODEM set to
the name of your default modem port?

Well, when you fire up Sterm, do you get the ***** Sterm online **** message?
If so, then everything if fine so far.  At this point you should be able to
type in "at" and hit enter.  The modem should respond with "OK".  If that
works, then just type in the dial command "atdt" and then the number. Sterm
doesn't have a fancy built in dialer.

Also, the environment variables you show above, are then in UPPERCASE on you
machine?  If not, Sterm won't recognize them since it is looking for UPPERCASE
variables.

Let me know how it goes.

I have been doing this for a long time, but only with 3 1/2 in disks.  I'm sure
you problem must be in the descriptor values, but I don't know what they should
be since I don't have a 5 1/4 inch disk on my machine.  Hopefully someone else

Hi all!

I'm the type of guy OS9/OSK software vendors moan and groan about. I've a hard
time making the 'jump' to what they're calling reasonably priced software for
our platforms.

Am I cheap? Perhaps. But I also like to think I know when I'm paying _way_ too
much for an application.

So that being said ... lemme pass on a couple of items I've been able to track
down relative to database programs for the OSK machines.

I have been a satisfied user of the CoCo version of Clearbrook's (604) 853-9118
IMS (Information Management System). In speaking with Paul Kehller (hope I
spelled it correctly!), he informs me a new version is due out in approximately
30 days. OSK price is $395.00. Clearbrook will apply the full purchase price of
the CoCo version (in my case $150) against the $395 for an "upgrade" to an OSK
version. Net to me .... $245. Not a bad deal!

Mr. Kehller sees no reason why it wouldn't run on the MM/1.

For another option, I spent about 20 minutes on the telephone with Fred Brown
of Peripheral Technologies (404) 973-2156 yesterday. They have several copies
(upwards of 70 ... make that 69. I bought one!) of an older release of
Sculptor. It's release 1.14:6. The manuals are still in their original shrink
wrap.

This is NOT the current release ... but neither is the price! For $75 dollars,
Mr Brown will ship it to you on your choice of disk formats.

This deal was to have appeared in the double issue of the OS9 Underground, but
somehow did not. The copies are official and you can apply the $75 towards the
current version price (Ed Gresick tells me $3,000) for an upgrade.

According to Mr. Brown, this version should run on the MM/1 and comes with a 5
day money back guarantee. Hard to beat!

Now the disclaimer .... I have nothing to do with either company. Just passing
along some information that may be of interest to other OSK users out there in
the ether.

If you do contact either of the gentlemen ... let 'em know where you found out
about the deal. Perhaps it will underscore the power of the electronic message
as a method of product support.

Thanks!

Has anyone used subroutine modules under OSK? I'd like to do something with

Even OS9 insights nicely avoids the subject.

I assume that to use a subroutine module you first link to it, grab the
execution offset and just to a jsr to that address???

Is it possible to have static storage in a subroutine module?

If anyone has some example code they have or can upload I'd be very

Scott...nope, sub-routines are not like 'Math" and "CIO". These are trap
routines and OS9 Insights does cover them quite well. It also says that traps
are much easier to use than subroutines, albeit slower. Then it nicely does not
show subroutines at all.

If you find the highlighting slowing down Ved, just set SM=1 in your env file
(or with the esc-e-e option). That'll turn off the progress hightlighting but
still show the unknown words.

Bob --

I've used subroutine modules in CD-I, to extend the functionality of a standard
high-level package (kinda like HyperCard's XCMD).  I attach below an example
(to compute the size of a rectangle across the diagonal without using sqrt).
As far as I know it's difficult to have static storage; I use a mixture of
getting the caller to pass the addresses of variables, combined with
self-modifying code (purists may groan but it's OK in CD-I).  You might
alternatively employ a shared data module.

First, a special cstart module:

* Radial.a

    use  oskdefs.d

    psect  XCMD,(Sbrtn<<8)+Objct,(ReEnt<<8),1,0,Start

    org  -32768

_attop  do.l  1
_mtop:  do.l  1
_stbot:  do.l  1
errno:  do.l  1
_totmem:  do.l  1
_sbsize:  do.l  1
_fcbs:  do.l  1
environ:  do.l  1
_pathcnt: do.w  1
_sysglob: do.l  1

Start:  dc.l  Function-Start     Offset to the C main program

Params  dz.l  3        This is the self-modifying storage area

* This function returns the address of an item of storage,
* organized as an array of pointers to data (see the C code).

Parameter: lea  Params(pc),a0
    asl.l  #2,d0
    move.l (a0,d0),d0
    rts

    ends

Next, the C part of the subroutine module:

/* Radial.c */

extern long *Parameter();     /* returns the address of a parameter */

void Function()               /* the main entry point */
{
 long width, height, square, n;

 width=*(Parameter(0));       /* get the data from the first variable */
 height=*(Parameter(1));      /* ditto the second */
 square=width*width+height*height;

 for (n=2; n*n<square; n++);
 *(Parameter(2))=n;           /* return the result */
}

Compile/assemble both modules and link.  To load the function, try:

   if ((addr=(char *)modload(name,S_IREAD))==(char *)-1)  Error();
   position=*(long *)(addr+sizeof(struct modhcom));
   addr+=position;      /* points to the start of the module (the offset)

To call it from C, pick up <addr>, put pointers to your variables in ((long
*)addr)[1], ((long *)addr)[2], etc, then:

   func=(void *)(addr+*((long *)addr));
   (*func)();

A warning: Not having static storage rules out the use of most of the standard
C libraries.  Good luck!

Graham, thanks for the example code. Now I think I know why MW uses traps
instead of subroutines. I was really hoping that static storage would be
available without having to pass it from the main routine. However, I have
listed out your message and will see if I can use this technique in my
programming efforts.

BTW, I am trying to set up my Ved editor so that different window systems can
use their own mouse drivers, etc. without ved having to know about such things.
At this point, however, it looks like it'll be easier for all (including the
folks who will end up writing there own interfaces) to have this done via a
front-end which interprets mouse data, etc. and inserts it into the keyboard
stream for ved.

Neat thing about OS9...there are always so many ways to do so many things.

Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203

My new super dupper ROMs finally arrived for my MM/1. They installed fine and
appear to be working...however, I can not boot from HD. With a floppy installed
without a boot file I get the message that it is attempting to boot from HD,
but that's it. No SCSI activity appears to be taking place. The only thing I
can think of is that the scsi controller ID which is being used is not the same
as my HD??? I have a HD on line 0.

OK....the obvious questions, did you do and os9gen on the hard drive to setup
the bootfile?  The SCSI ID of the drive should be zero so that seems to be
correct.

Chris,

I think you're our first member from the Colony, but does it count that my wife
and I think of HK as our home-away-from-home?

She was attending UHK when we met, many years ago, and still has lots of family
in HK.

 OS-9 has versions that run on Motorola 6809 or Hitachi 6309,
                     and       Motorola 680x0 processors.

 OS-9000 is an enhanced version of OS-9 that is written in C (instead of
assembly like its predecessor) that runs on Intel 80386 and higher processors
as well as the high end of the Motorola 680x0 family.  C makes it portable, but
for performance considerations some or the deep kernel routines are done in
assembly.

In many ways the OS-9(000) family of operating systems resemble Unix.  However,
as I understand it, Unix while is multi-tasking and multi-user, it is not
what's referred to as a real-time operating system.  OS9 has a pre-emptive
interupt system.  OS9 is also ROMable which makes it very handy for black-box
applications.  Chances are you've used an OS-9 system at some time in your life
without knowing it.  (I've been told that the do-it-yourself electronic scales
at some post offices are run by atROM-based OS-9 system under the covers.  And
that's just one.  FermiLab uses an OS-9 system.  NASA uses OS-9, I'm told on
the shuttle.)

There are experts in the forum here that are far more advance in the use hf
OS-9, but I'm sold on its viability and vitality.
