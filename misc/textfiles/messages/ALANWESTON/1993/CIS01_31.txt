Bill, I need your help again :-). I have connected my pc to the MM/1 via the
/T1 port. I have been able to setup mstmon and had no problems. I have also
been able to run Terminal on the MM/1 and Telex on the pc and send files from
the MM/1 to the clone at upto 19200 baud. My problem comes when I try to send
files from the clone to the MM/1. I have raised the input and output buffers to
8192. Any ideas why I can't send from the clone but I can from the MM/1?

Thanks Keith

Keith,

What kind of problems are you having? I send and receive files on /T1 from a
CoCo at 9600 baud, and on /T0 via a modem from a PC at work, and the only
problems I have are with the CoCo. Are you using a protocol transfer, like
xmodem?

Bill,

I can't transfer a file from the clone to the MM/1. I keep getting errors and
it finally stops sending. I have tried using xydown, and rz (modified to use
t1) as well as using Terminal and it's built in xmodem, xmodem-1k, and Ymodem
batch. I have the port set for 19200 and the buffers set to 8192. I was also
having the problem at 9600 baud. Now that I think about it my buffers were
smaller when I tried it at 9600 so I will try it some more at that speed.

While we're on serial problems...

I was here last night on another forum doing a capture of a library directory.
I signed on at 9600 with a LAP-M connection. I am using /t3 with TYPE=80 in the
desc. (which should enable hardware handshaking), plus I have my buffers set to
4K for in/output.

Now, when I was reading the directory I got a repeating sequence of some 20 or
so lines. I was doing a disk capture at the same time.

So, who's screwing up? Is the serial driver buggy in telling the modem to wait?
Or is the modem confused (remember, it is doing error correction)? Or is CIS?
Darned if I know...I logged off and tried again at 2400 and it worked fine.

I suspect there is a problem with the MM/1 screen not being fast enuf and
something with the DMA to the HD. Paul Ward told me that there was something
one could do with the size of packets being written to the HD--but he couldn't
remember what it was <grin>.

Bob,

Were you using Sterm? That's symptomatic of a read error of some kind (the
repeating data), and is actually a bug in Sterm, although at least one byte
would have been lost, in any case.

There is a chance that the DMA to the HD was causing problems. Carl explained
this to me once, theoretically decreasing the size of the chunk of data sent to
the HD might improve the situation, but would slow down the data transfer rate
to the HD significantly.

In InfoXpress I do all my own software flow control, and rarely, if ever, have
any problems. But I send a ^S before writing to disk, then a ^Q to get things
going again, which I guess would help avoid the problem.

I've also noticed that when doing large zmodem transfers, that if there is any
other disk activity, like from another window, that I get an occasional 244
error.

Yup, I'm using sterm. Most times it's all I need; and I can get it to work too.
I look forward to seeing InfoXpress (I'm just disappointed that you didn't ask
me to beta test <grin>).

Speaking of strangness and lost bits...(nothing to do with sterm) if I have a
lot of scsi activity (like formatting/verifying a HD) I get real strange
responses on my keyboard. Again, could be that chuck size problem. Frankly, I'd
give up a touch of speed (after all, this guy is pretty fast as is) for a bit
more on the reliablity side of the equation.

I use Sterm all the time too, even when I could be using InfoXpress :-)

I get strange responses on my keyboard too, like "automatmic" window switching,
and characters being generated when I'm pressing arrow keys. This is
particularly bad when I'm doing a lot of editing, and typing fast, while
something like a compile is going on in another window. Maybe we can find
someone to come up with a patch.

There is a bug is Sterm that causes the repeated lines when the receive buffer
overflows.  The cause in Bob's case was he was probably capturing files to the
disk and the data was being displayed on the screen at the same time.  If you
do this at 9600 baud, the MM/1 screen will eventually fall behind and the
buffer will overflow.  Increasing the size of the receive buffers only
increases the time it takes to happen--but it eventually will.

The solution is to not display anything on the screen while doing a capture.
This has been included in the Sterm-Pro code.  I'm also looking into how to
make the screen printing faster, but haven't succeeded.  For now, it is best to
download the file instead of capturing it if you can.  If you must do a
capture, then breaking it up into smaller chunks will help.  Of course, the
BEST method is to get IX (grin).

The problem is the MM/1 screen scrolling can't keep up at 9600 baud with Sterm.
Ed Gresick tells me he has an assembly language term program that has no
problem with his Sys IV in this area, but Sterm does.  I have looked at the
Sterm code to see where I could speed things up, but haven't come up with
anything yet.  In the mean time, I've set Sterm up so if you are doing a
capture at 9600 baud, it will ask you if you want to have it displayed on the
screen also.  Actually, I can't see the need for the screen display since you
can't read it anyway.  If you'd like a copy of this version of Sterm, contact
Ed.  The one I'm using is Sterm-Pro, and it's not near ready to be given out
even as an alpha copy.

Mark,

I just had a look at the STERM source. I guess a few things could be done...let
me know if you tried either (in which case I won't):

1. Right now you are writing to the screen as soon as you get 10 characters in
your buffer. If this was increased it would cut down considerably on the
overhead involved in system calls. I'd look at increasing the buffer to a full
line (or more?) and print it whenever the modem doen't have something, it is
full or if a CR is received.

2. What about sending an xon/off sequence before/after the screen writes (esp.
if you increase the buffer size). Hmmm, maybe this would just add too much
overhead? Probably. Maybe just if you have a full buffer to print?

3. Finally, what about checking the number of characters ready from the modem.
If there are a large number (and a disk capture is being done) you could just
dump a whole packet to the disk and not bother to display it. I don't like
this...but I'd rather have gaps in the stuff scrolling by than gaps in the
stuff in the disk file.

The problem with turning off screen display is: how do you know when to turn it
back on? After listing a file or whatever you get a prompt--and with the screen
display off....

I can't see how changing anything to asm. would make a marked difference in
thoughput.

The problem with doing testing from this end is getting something else to dump
data to my screen fast enuf. Hmmm, I suppose I could hook up a null modem to my
coco or something and see.

Keith, to solve the problem with the last line not scrolling change the
definition of of 'sf' in your termcap entry from \015 to \012 ($0d to $0a). Ved
1.x used Writeln() to do its screen stuff. This caused some problems, so we now
use Write(). If you had $0d as sf it got translated to $0a in 1.x. Doesn't work
now. BTW, there is a good termcap entry for the mm/1 in the file
docs/termcap.txt on the dist. disk.

And for those of you who already have recieved your Ved 2.0 update...a chapter
was left out of the manual (Spellcheck). It is now in the mail to you.

Thanks for the Quantum numbers. Unfortunately, they no longer support the

customer support from it. To get assistance you can call 900-740-4433. This
costs $5.00 PER call. Or you can call them "free" at 408-944-0410.

I called them earlier today and they agreed to replace my drive under warnt.
However, I didn't have the serial number...so I asked if I could just send that
to them in the MAIL and they could MAIL me the RMA number. The fellow at the
other end just didn't know what to do with a crazy request like that, it
suggested I could fax it. Guess I'll spend some more grocery money on another
call.

BTW, Maxtor have a very good customer support service and excellent return
policy...they send out the new drive and when you get it, then you return the
defective one. Guess which drive I'd buy today? Mind you, Quantum do seem to be
a bit quieter and a tad faster...

  I've just uploaded a file to patch the "rma" supplied with the CoCo Level 2

(Languages), the name is "rmapat.ar".  You will need "ar" and "ipatch" along
with the stock version of "rma".  I did not include a patch to c.asm for those
not having "rma".  One addition I did make to the program is the ability to
create edition 0 ROF's so that one could create public library files
(c.link-compatible).
  One note:  I have just now completed the project and there may possibly be
bugs.  Be watchful for a while.  There may be a few bugs in the old 6309 codes
also, as I had to change some of the data types to allow for the 32-bit stuff. 
I'd appreciate anyone who is interested to download it and test it out.

Mark,

I had thought that the floptical might be better than a tape drive, but at $25
a disk, that works out to a lot of money for backing up a big hard drive. I'm
planning on getting a bigger HD for my MM/1, currently I have only 48M, and its
just not enough. I get tired of feeding floppies now, when backing up the 48M,
I can't imagine what it will be like when I get a 200M HD. So I also plan on
getting a tape drive (and maybe a floptical :-) for backup at the same time I
get the new drive.

I'm also planning on moving the 48M over to the CoCo, have you heard anything
about the Ken-Ton SCSI interface for the CoCo?

etc. I've seen at least one company here in town advertising the drives - they
want too much, but if they have it, other companies will too, and for better
prices.

Greetings,
        I'm trying to find a way to connect several 68k based OS9 racks
together in some sort of sane fashion so I can send messages between them. The
comms medium is high speed point to point parallel links. Anybody got any ideas
of how I might do this other than using NFM??

In addition does anybody have any comments on Microwares support services eg
driver writing etc?

All responses gratefully appreciated
Nick Terry (UK).

Hello Nick

I have NFM running on top of Microware's ISP(tcp/ip) and it runs concurrent
wihout problems. The nice thing about using NFM is that it enables you to use
'pipes' and 'i/o-devices' on the other systems, so it is easy to do
task-communication between systems.

The device-driver-writters at Microware is quite good at their jobs, but they
are human-people like you and me, so the make 'bugs' also, but they have the
advantage that they can talk to 'inhouse knowledge' about all kinds(kernel and
filemanagers). So in general I feel that the are doing a nice service. My
company (danelec electronics) has been an OEM customer for 6 years now, and
always felt that somebody worked for us, if we had problems.

regards ole b. hansen ole@danelec.dk
