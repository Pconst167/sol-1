OK, I think I've seen that program advertised.

Do you have good termcap entries?  Are you running from /term or G-Windows?

I've found that under G-Windows, a few programs, termcaps or terminfo's, one,
don't produce linefeeds but do under /term.  Perhaps it is something like this?

Sb: #Windows 95 praise?
Fm: Rogelio Perea 72056,1204

I recently had a long chat with a close friend about operating systems.  He has
always been a MSDOS junkie, even had the courage to have bought a PC Jr when it
became available. Well, he started to talk about Windows 95 wonders:

        True multitasking environment
        Multi-thread operations
        and so on...

I remembered that about 5 or 6 years ago we had a similar conversation when he
was installing a computer network in the radio stations where I work at. I
mentioned OS9 could do the same work he was projecting and a lot cheaper and
with less hassle. He was shocked! (more of a rage attack I'd say). I recall he
told me: "Why would we want to multitask? I can't even think in a multi-task
way, how would we program?". Well, that ended there.

This time though, while he was praising W95, he commented something about
multi-threading. I said that OS9 also worked by establishing separate processes
and that these could work on their own and call other processes.... He told me,
"Well, then it should be like W95. Unix works that way too". I had to restrain
myself into taking him into the room where my CoCo 3 is installed, after all, I
want to ease the shock on him after I show him what I can do with an investment
of less than $500.00.  He had to soup up his 486DX50 memory and HD for W95....
lost love for a few bucks in the process <G> ;-)

Rogelio,

 >>  "Why would we want to multitask? I can't even think in a multi-task way,
how would we program?" <<

 Each Software has many tasks in the sense of "many things to do". So if we
can't think in a multitask way, why not program one task after another?

 I think the main difference  between OS like OS-9 and others like WIN95 are
t5heir target groups. With the first one you can efficiently solve the problem,
what a program has to do. So you have the machine in the foreground. With the
second one you can efficiently solve the problems that an online user has with
computers. From this point of view there is no machine anymore, but only a user
that is frightend of it<g>

It used to be that Microware and Intersolv supported each other, but for
"political reasons", I heard, no more. Since I have to used both products, I
wonder if anybody has edited the vcscap file of FasTrak to include PVCS. It
doesn't look like it is all that hard to do, but I'd like to save myself the
trouble if it has been done before...

Can anyone tell me the source of this error message, please?

It's not in my manual, which goes up to 174!

I've replaced the SCSI drive in my system (running OS9 V2.4) with a new larger
one (now 1GByte), and every time I try to access /fh0 to format it, or /h0 to
access it normally I get 'Error 175'.

I've spent all week trying various combinations and experimenting, and got
nowhere. Both drive and interface are O.K. - it's a compatibility problem.
Full details if anyone can shed any light.

Incidentally, has anyone ever got satisfactory technical support out or
Microware U.K?

Les Wilkinson.
