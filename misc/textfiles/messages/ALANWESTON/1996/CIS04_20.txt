Greetings
  I am looking for Brian White formally(bcwhite@sunee.waterloo.ca). Or does
anyone have a copy of rcs4 for OS9?  The copy on os9archive is corrupt as
reported by a user and verified by me(sysop).  I would like to relace it w a
good version. Please email me with Brains new email address or ftp a copy to
the os9archive.rtsi.com.

I guess if I have to ask, I will be of no help, but what's DDX?

Sorry it took so long to get back, but I was away on business.

Yes...I'm using OS/9 Level 1 (I know...but it's all I have). What happens is
when I use Jeff's RETRIEVE program, the first sector is ALWAYS unreadable.
Every sector after that reads fine. I'm of the opinion that the format for
Level 1 is different than level 2 as I have heard that many have used OS/9 l2
on the emulator with nothing but success.

What do you think?

Ok, some of this will sound goofy, but try 'em anyway.

Take a write protect label and use it to cover the index hole in the diskette
jacket. The PC generates a HW interrupt whenever it see the index hole, but the
interrupt is only used during formatting, not reading / writing.

Also, when RETRIEVE gives you the "Abort, Retry, Ignore, Continue" message,
slowly open and close the drive door while pressing Retry.

I know it sounds silly, but try it.

Ok, it ain't pretty, but it should work.
Each run displays a different set of numbers, though.
What STUPID thing am I doing wrong?
I do know for a true CRC, I have to complement the accumulator,
but that isn't the problem.

Well, I don't know why, but it seems that this doesn't work. Maybe it's because
$FF is the end-of-string delimiter for Basic09.

Try the sequence (for count=0 to 2 print peek(addr(acc)+count) and see.  For
some reason, the Print below, if put up here, gives $FF, but it is not the
case.

Try the sequence, for count=0 to 3, poke addr(acc)+count, $ff

I have not tried it on a true module, but at least it gives consistent results.

David, thanks for the reply.

Alan DeKok pointed out to me that the "correct" way to do this is to use an
array of bytes, rather than a character string. When I changed to Bytes, it
worked much better.

Thanks,

Yes, I thought that that would probably would be the more "correct" way but
this still works.  What I did was just a quick-and-dirty method..

Well, I'm back here again with the same problem. I cannot create an image of my
OS9 level 1 disk for my emulator to use.  I've tried everything. Even tried the
suggested method of covering the index hole and opening & closing the drive
door slowly during retries. It just will NOT copy.

If any of you have been able to accomplish this....let me know how you did it.
I'm at my wits end here...

thx!

I am currently maintaining a piece of software running on V2.4 of OS9/68000.
This software was compiled using Ultra C V1.1.1.  In this software is a call to
_OS9_GETIME in which the tick count is returned.  The documentation indicates
that the lower 16 bits contains the current tick.  The original author assumed
that the tick would count all the way to 65535 and then roll over.  However, I
am seeing the software roll over after the value 100. (There are 100 ticks in a
second.)  The documentation is woefully lacking in describing the values of the
tick.  Is this roll over at the number of ticks per second the way these
functions always work?

Thanks for your help!

Doug,

>>  The documentation indicates that the lower 16 bits contains the current
tick. <<

This is true, the higher two bytes indicate the tick-rate in ticks per second.
If you have as usual 100 ticks per second, the u_int variable would count from
$640000 up to $640063 and then start again with $640000 (this corresponds to
6553600 resp. 6553699 decimal).
