Yer code's wrong sez Popeye the C-man.

Your second for-loop is copying the end of workpath[] to the end of
dirt[]. When it gets to the last '/' in workpath[] it stops, leaving
random garbage in the first part of dirt[].  I'm not all that sure what
you're trying to do, extract the file name from the path or extract all
the directory names from the path.  It looks more like you're trying to
extract the file name but that printf("Directory... is confusing.

think of it this way, knowing os9 will give you an advantage since msdos

Hmmmm!
Should I clear the array 'dire[]' with a statement like this:
do {
     dirt[i] = ' ';  /*set to space*/
while(i++ <= strlen(dirt));

In the for() loop:
     for(  ; j> 0; i--, j--) 
     
The variable 'j' counts back 9 places.

The variable 'i' counts forward 27 places but the string is only
26 places long. I assume that that extra place is a NULL terminator 
that C places at the end of a string.

I am trying to extract the last directory name from a path.

Maybe when I count the length of 'i I should set a flag each time
I encounter a '/' and start 'strcpy' from there.

Thanks for the feedback.

    I certainly believe that... Unfortunately MS*DOS based applications
are still demanding TONS of memory... Perhaps PK-Lite would help a
bit.... Seems like BIG BIG drives are the only way to go...

BTW: are you getting burried in snow up there, or are you (un)fortuante
enough to just miss it... I heard Philly really got dumped on (so bad
that the city went 60hrs w/o a crime reported).

    BTW II: Remeber those projects you had done internally with the CC3
I/O ports???? I was looking at my Service book, and YUCK! they use a5 to
determine WHAT PIA to select internally. the three lines coming out of
the GIME (ACVC) chip runs to that decoder, but it only uses 4 outs for
ROM, CTS, SCS, and the internal PIA select... I really don't understand
how the ACVC chip actually uses those lines for memory decoding... Any
Ideas????

(this was brought on by me thinking of adding that simplified Parallel
port to my CoCo, while leaving enough area untouched as for further
expansion in the future. (i.e. room for the 8-bit address space using
5830 SCSI controller and 16550 UARTS.)

  Sorry for taking so long to reply, but I just got back from a 3&1/2 week
holiday.
  No, the TC-9 (and the Eliminator serial ports as well), use the 6552 chip,
which has the hardware bugs of the 6551 fixed, has 2 serial ports per chip,
and allows baud rates up to 38400 instead of just 19200. Since Bruce is the
one created the Eliminator in the first place, he was quite familiar with the
6552 chip, and simply patched OSTerm to use the newer system calls he put in
both SACIA (6551) & DACIA (6552) to allow the auto-dialer to work properly.
The copy of the patch I have is called OSTERM.ARC, and it contains an INSTALL
script, a READ.ME file, and the ipatch file called OSTRM208.IPC.
  As it is now, I have to go to Supercomm to do auto-dialing, though it will
only let you dial one phone number repeatedly.

[37mDate    : 96/01/15  20:17:00[33m

   Think of it this way.  Windows 3.1 (and Win '95 for that matter) are
DOS programs that run under DOS.  DOS is not a multi-Tasking OS, but
simply a Disk Operating System.  GSHELL (that's Multi-Vue from TANDY) is 
an OS-9 program that runs under OS-9.  OS-9 is a Multi-Tasking OS that
GSHELL can make System Calls to.  Windows has only DOS calls it can make 
(there are some Windows calls, but they still make calls to DOS), so
Windows is limited in some ways.
   Windows NT, however is Multi-Tasking and so is OS/2.  But they both
don't have the nice features that OS-9 has (like re-enterant code that's 
position independant, etc.).

Greetings and salutations, Christian!!

 RT> An intriguing idea, until Eric gets his .QWK mailer finished, but

 CM> Thank you...
 
You're welcome. Actually, I've thought about it a bit and I've decided
that it's not JUST intriguing...it's also kind of a NEAT idea...wish
I'd thought of it myself <grin>! I can't remember if you mentioned
you're planning on doing this, or if it's on a "to do" list, but you
might want to consider having the program using different tagline
files for different areas. That is, programming-related taglines for
programming echoes (although I use them here in the CoCo and OS-9 ECHOES
<grin>), Star Trek taglines for Star Trek ECHOES, etc.

A word of warning, though. For some strange reason, there are people
out "there" that actually HATE taglines and REFUSE to them. Should one
(or more) such person use your BBS and should that person discover
that you're adding taglines to their messages anyway, they're likely
to start bitching at you! Not that there's much you can do about it
(except not use your program, of course) and not that it'll actually
happen (those people are few and far between, thankfully), but I
figured I'd mention it...so you're not surprised if it SHOULD happen
to you <grin>!!

 CM> My own ignorance.  I did not realize there was a "proper" way to add
 CM> taglines. <g>
 
Well, lots of off-line readers have the capability of making taglines
(as well as the other portions of a message) stand out, so a standard
method of adding them is needed. This also makes stealing - er, sorry,
I of course meant "adopting" <grin>!! - taglines, which is a very
popular past-time, easier. OTOH, since leaving that message to you,
I've noticed that there are a number of other programs, as well as
some OLR's, that don't add taglines in the standard method either.
Fortunately, Blue Wave allows one to do a "cut-and-paste" while
adopting taglines, so it can handle the non-standard taglines. But
it's always best, whenever possible (not to mention whenever required
<grin>!) to follow the standards...makes everybody happy <grin>!!

 CM> Thank you again!!  While I was reading your message, I adjusted the
 CM> source code to your specifications.  I'm working on v1.1 right now,

Well, they're not really "my" specifications, just the standard way of
adding taglines. Figured I'd mention it to save you some grief...there
are some people that take taglines VERY seriously! How seriously?
Seriously enough that FidoNet has a whole echo devoted to taglines!!!!

[37mDate    : 96/01/17  00:37:00[33m

XPost from JeffV

------

I just had a look over the info, and it seems that the CoCo 3 emulator can
only reasonably be increased to 255 sectors/track, not 256.  Sorry. :-)
  
To make this change, you'd need to patch the code as listed below.  The
offsets are for the absolute latest version of COCO3.EXE, but the code
fragments will be in older versions, just at different offsets potentially.
  
Note that once you do this, 18 SPT virtual disks will be unreadable.  You'll
need to rescale a virtual disk in order for it to make any sense to the
emulator.  (Since .DSKs store the entire disk sector-by-sector, you'll have
to take every 18*256 bytes of the 18 SPT disk and pad them with enough FF's
to fill 255*256 bytes.)  Note that this patch might make a raw format command
go a little funny, so you might have to do an explicit sector write after a
track format in order to get the sectors initialised to FF's.
  
At offset $1372F of COCO3.EXE, change B0 12 F6 26 to 
                                      B0 FF F6 26.
At offset $137E4 of COCO3.EXE, change B0 12 F6 26 to 
                                      B0 FF F6 26.
At offset $13878 of COCO3.EXE, change B8 12 00 F6 26 to
                                      B8 FF 00 F6 26.
At offset $13886 of COCO3.EXE, change 3C 12 72 to
                                      3C FF 72.
  
Feel free to rebroadcast this post wherever appropriate.
  
(I'm sure most people notice that the number $12 being changed to $FF is
indeed the SPT count.)

Yes, version 1.1 is going to be able to do that through a .cfg file.  My 
problem is getting VikingTag to know which area is which.  <g>

Up-to-date what? If he's talking about OCN files...I've never been hooked up
to the OCN. I offered to carry the files a LONG time ago and have plenty of HD
space to do so (at least 80 megs empty right now), but there were no takers
(probably because of my running Acbbs or something). I didn't catch the front
end of this conversation apparently :).

[37mDate    : 96/01/18  21:47:00[33m

January 18, 1996

I  have  the following Tandy Color Computer items for sale.  All are
used (or in store demos),  but work and include documentation.  Most
also include boxes.  Prices listed are what I would like, but they
may be negotiable depending on mood.  Shipping is extra.

***** OS9 Stuff
*****  This stuff is a bit heavier than the others, so
*****  I've uped the price a bit to pay for the shipping
*****  All are CoCo 3 items.
OS9 Level 2 V 2.00.01 NEW, UNOPENED!                    $20  (heavy)
  (Try find this somewhere else!)
OS9 Level 2 V 2.00.00 Poor condition                    $20  (heavy)
  (Actually, docs are 2.00.00, disks are 2.00.01)
OS9 Multi-Vue                                           $20
Deskmate 3                                              $15
OS9 Pascal V 2.0  (Includes the p-code                  $25
  to asm translator).  ISO-0 Pascal
  P-code compiler with virtual memory
  for code.  (Inlcudes a few non ISO-0
  extensions such as 'bit's but not
  strings.)  Virtual code memory lets
  you run very large Pascal programs.

***** RS-DOS Development (disk)
Deft Pascal V4.1 for CoCo DOS (not os9)                 $30
  Works with CC2 & CC3.  Includes Pascal compiler,
  macro assembler, linker, debugger, library manager,
  editor and 'shell'. Excellent language extensions
  such as strings, reals, modules, bitwise operators,
  type extensions.  Works under PC CoCo emulator.
  I hate to lose this one, but since I use a PC I
  probably wouldn't ever use this again, and maybe
  somebody actually needs it.
  (Remind me to include patch to remove copy protection
   so you can make backup copies of it.)

this stuff, but I also would like  to  make a few $$ in the process.
If you see a couple of more expensive items, we  might  be  able  to
talk about it.

Shipping is _approximately_ $1-$2 for one item, $2-$3 for two items,
and $3-$4 for three or more items.  Prices are in  US$  only,  as  I
don't have the faintest idea how to convert other currancies to US$.

Hello All!

A nice large article appeared in this month's "Multimedia Producer" magazine
concerning CD-i.  I left the thing at work, so I may not have this spelled
right, but a company named "Muffin Head Multimedia" has been quite successful
with training and point-of-sale kiosks using CD-i.  Another short news article
said Sears Roebuck Co. has standardized on CD-i for training employees.  Even
a mention of OS9 and DAVID.

I'd like to find the author of the 1986 Deft Pascal V4.1 Pascal compiler
for the CoCo and obtain the source code for it.

Does anybody know where TCE Programs Inc. is anymore?  I know it was
somewhere in Maryland, but that's been quite a few years ago.

How about Ted Malaska, who was the president?

How about DEFT Systems Inc, who wrote the compiler?

The compiler isn't the best, but it has some very nice extensions, and
I'm wanting a Pascal compiler in source to play with.  The only one I've
been able to find was an old ISO Level 0 one.

(Don't you just hate it when a company copy protects a program disk and
then goes out of business?... Not that that part really matters, I broke
that copy protection shortly after I bought it in 88.)

Ok,  John Reece our club librarian is still looking for the B&B
interface schematics.  I still plan on getting those out ASAP.  Will
post when available and let everybodt know.
 
NEW SUBJECT:  MC68881 Co-Processor Interface
 
     I have come across an old article in the "68' Micro Journal" which
gave some base information on how to hook up the MC68881 Floating Point
Unit to a 6809 based unit.  After doing some research I did figure out
how to hook it up to a COCO 3 and get it to work electronically.  This
is now available but there is no software for OS-9, however there wass
mention of somebody doing this also based on this article as well.  I
don't know the guys name or other info but if somebody knows what I'm
referering to please help all of us.  BTW copies of the schematics for
this circuit and theory of operation can be had for $5.00 to help pay
copying and postage send payment to.

Yeah, that could be a tad difficult, seeing as you don't have the kind
of info available that a QWK packet gives you. Unfortunately, as I've
never run RiBBS (I have Warren's RiBBS-To-Go package, but I've never
used it), I'm afraid I don't know the message base format and can't
help you there. But I certainly wish you lots of luck <grin>!!!

     I was reffering to the availability of most new files, it seems
like the two haunts of mine, probably because of being off the beaten
track of most of us looking for system upgrades (New software, etc). I
was looking for replacement parts for my C-Compiler. ie. a new CGFX.L
file. While Carolina Connection and Astral Plane are BOTH fine boards,
the supply of NEW files available seem to trickle slower to them than to
others... shortly after hearing of the release of OSTerm 2.11 (& 2.10),
I failed to find them available on these two boards. This may be
corrected now, but... it's nice to keep up... OCN or otherwise.

<NOTE: while this may seem like nit-picking, it isn't intended to be.
BOTH
    boards have helped me considerably, and do our OS-9(/CoCo)
Communities
    well.>

There must have been some miss communication somewhere because I'm almost
certain I had you set up here at one time. I've since removed your node from
my files and deleted the files waiting after they grew to several hundred k on
my system after never receiving a poll. Will AcBBS receive files that way? If
so I can set you up again or you can arrange it with someone closer to you.

Later, Tim!

no, i missed that part too, i assumed he meant because i haven't added
files in awhile. it can't be because of my software! I run Wildcat 4.0
for messy dos. I am more limited in hard disk space right now since the
bbs sucks up more space then a coco based bbs would. i only have a 105
meg hard disk for the bbs (to a coco thats alot of space, to a messy-dos
system, its small) i plan to add more space in the spring.
