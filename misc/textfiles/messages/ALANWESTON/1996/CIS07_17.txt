Sb: Web Browser For OS-9 ?
Fm: Marc Tritschler 100344,2706

Is there anyone out there who can tell me if anyone has developed or is
developing a Web browser that will run on OS-9 machines with GUI's e.g. the MGR
GUI.

I would be even more impressed if a java enabled browser could be sourced.

Thanks in anticipation,

Marc.

Hi,
Is there anyone coming from an electronics/instrumentation background?
Do you know of an electronic (fluxgate) sensor which can detect the earth's
magnetic field and provide a signal which can be interfaces to a
microprocessor.
Autopilots in navigation systems use them a lot, but I am looking for a
miniture/low
cost type suitable for portable applications.

If you are a supplier/manufacturer, please send me a data-sheet with price and
availability in UK. If you know of any published articles - please send me the
full
reference.

Thank you.

Hi,
Is there anyone in UK who is still using OS9/6809 or 68k systems
and would like to get hold of some working hardware. I have a few
systems which I would like to get rid of. My users have adopted
PC based solutions.

If you are interested, please let me know. Thanks.

Hi,

does anyone have experience with the MW FastTrack cross compiler ?

I have the problem that my output files have about double size as the ones
compiled on a 68K system with cc.
