John,
    Did I ever send you the C source stuff from Wes Gale for bundle,
unbundle, export, fconvert, mailimport, preq and rbpass ?
The filename is 'ribbssource.zip' 136,370 bytes.  Maybe Brian will have
use for it.

I am excited to see some interest in modern computers for OS-9!  As you may
know, IBM, Motorola, and Apple are comming together to a Common Hardware
Referance Platform (CHARP) so that multiple OS's can be ported to the
Power-PC. I do hope that people "see the light"  and either design their
boards to this standard or (probably a better idea) use one of the Mororola
boards in whatever they market.  The one-off propreitary systems previously
used (MM1, Kix/20, Kix/30, AT306, etc.) are really a bad idea for the OS-9
community. The CHARP idea makes sure that common hardware services are at
defined address and other such niceties so that one OS-9 is ported to one
system, it should be available on all compliant systems.

I do hope those who make OS-9 available will start using off-the shelf
hardware instead of the the "one-off" stuff now used.  If OS-9 can't make it
commercially on mainstream hardware, then maybe it's time to move on to
something else like Linux, QNX, or whatever.

In anticipation of statements about cost, I submit that far more people have
left the OS-9 community to run on Intel 486 and Pentiums that anything else.
They didn't mind spending $1,500 to $2,500 on a system that was fast and
powerful and generally usefull.  A Power PC based system would be great! I
would rather spend money on something that would allow Multi-booting between
OS-9, Linux, NT, MAC-OS than something _only_ able to run an obscure real-time
OS.  Why, the darn thing might even support Ethernet cards, TCP/IP networking,
and 115k serial ports.  And then, maybe. it will be possible to port webserver
software, FTP, Telnet, NFS, etc. to OS-9.

Dennis, I am  looking to use my existing OS-9 license to  get this
machine off the ground, then upgrade.  And straight OS-9/68xxx is the
cheaper license.

 What about using one of the PowerPC 604e processors for a MM1 ??
There would be some interest as that is what the newer MACs are using as 
well as the new SUNos crowd. Would make a great Web Server.

   I hope this is getting through to you! If this works, I and the
