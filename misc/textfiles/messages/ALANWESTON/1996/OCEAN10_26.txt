Hello.

The Zone 1 Backbone only carries echoes listed in the Zone 1 EchoList.  It
seems that the listing for this echo will expire this month.  Thus, it is
necessary for the moderator to update it's listing if it is to remain on the
Zone 1 Backbone.

For more information please consult these files:  BOFAQxxx.TXT and
ELISTxxx.ZIP, where "xxx" is the version number.  They are available from most
hubs or can be requested from 1:1/200, 1:1/201, 1:283/120 or 1:396/1.

If you need assistance, please contact Marge Robbins, 1:283/120.

Dave,
    The time you were on and experiancing the pauses when you type in on
your end is caused by your USR Modem.  You can get new ROMS from the mfg
if you contact them with the trouble.  It is not your term program.
There is a temp fix you can do by setting &K0, no data compression.

I'm thinking about that, but leaning away from it.  AT306 sales are
nearly nil, and the margin is not enough to pay for my time in preparing
the few ads I have distributed, much less any other expense.  In fact,
no profit at all is made until a person is buying in quantities of 5 or

  How about a port to the older Macintosh?  I know that the 68040 Mac's are
slow compared to the PowerPC and Intel Pentium but with OS-9 and a GUI (maybe
resurrect Gwindows), it might sell.  You could design a supplemental boot ROM
or something.  The advantage is that if successful, we all get to tap into a
whole bunch of affordable stuff rather than having yet another obscure
motherboard.  If you design a motherboard yourself, I wonder where you will
find the resources to get a PCI chipset in correctly?  I'll bet it takes more
than $100,000 to design a modern board that consumers will pay much for.
Your product will be measured, whether you agree or not, against the $500
Intel Pentium mother boards with PCI slots, built -in EIDE , etc, etc.  The
small guy can't compete anymore.

Not mean, not hateful, just discouraged...

The profit margin I understand. Having spent many years in retail sales I
know it is very easy to give away the store.

What I am fixing to say, you already know. 

You can have the best product (a better mouse trap) in the world and the
world WILL NOT beat a path to your door. You must go to their door. 
Promotion is the only way to sell a new product. For the AT306 and your
new board (in mother board form only) you would need to get into some
of the big industrial computer shows and display it capabilities.

Kevin Pease and I talked about this for an hour on the phone last year.
You need to ask yourself this question,"Is there a product on the market
that sells for this price? Am I willing to make my own nitch in that marker?"
Compaq didn't make a better computer and sit waiting for people to come to
them.

Each state works hard to bring new industries to their towns and cities.
One of the ways they help is to provide new business information in the form
of sources of venture capital and development plans. I know the State of
Texas provides a pretty thick packet of this information

I'll get off my soapbox now, you understand what I'm saying. These new
products are not being marketed aggressively enough.

Allen, I don't know my way around the MacIntosh, but I am looking for
a board that can be used for serious industrial and commerical uses.  I
don't think the 68040 fits there, indeed the 68060 barely fits.  PCI
can be supported, and I suspect that the cost will be significantly less
than you would expect.  I'm also looking for some commerical uses to
undertake that would subsidize the personal market - perhaps some
networked games or simulators - 
 
Just sign me, -Optimistic in New Orleans.

Dave, you are entirely right.  I too have though about this. 
Unfortunately, I am also still right.  Without margin there is no money
to spend on promotions.  The AT306 relies on its resellers to provide
their own capital for promotion without regaining that capital from
sales.  That has  stunted sales.  It would do the same thing with a new
board.  The price HAS to come up.  In order for the price to come up,
you must either sell whole systems only, or sell a more powerful
motherboard.   Or you must CREATE your won markets with other products.

I just read that IBM was releasing there specs on there 
LONG TRAIL MOTHERBOARD for the taking. It is a PowerPC PCI based Motherboard
with both MAC and PC connectors and support.  IBM  isn't going to mass 
produce these boards, but is giving the specs out free so some motherboard
cloner can mass produce it.   It isn't PPCP compliant yet, because you still
need a option APPLE ROM card to run MAC-OS.   Maybe that would be something
to look into.  If you can have these made at reasonable cost and Port your
personal OS-9 to 601 code so when I actually buy a new computer it isn't 
using 10 year old parts.  Within 6 months I am hopefully going to buy a
new OS-9 computer...MM1B.   I do feel a little uneasy about the Motherboard
and will be willing to buy a more "upto date" Motherboard.  I want something 
that I can replace in 10 years, not having to "hunt" for old technology to
keep it running.   

Just a thought
