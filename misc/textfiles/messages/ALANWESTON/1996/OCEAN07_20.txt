Dave,
  I can give you the "getopt()" function and Karl's Library. It's called
"os9lib.l"
 Getopt() is part of os9lib.l, but don't have any docs on them.
  BTW, Warren said the desktop is ready for you.

Can you put Carls library up on Terrys board? Tell Warren I will get the
desktop soon. Will have to go back to Houston to call. This fast modem on my
daughters here cant access ProComm for some reason.
 
Thanks.
 
May call you Sun 22, I am having trouble with my computer hemoraging (sp). It
drops through 'gets()'. Recieves some kind of signal that it thinks is a
carrage return. If I put a printf() to see what it is it looks like the
address of the string to recieve the input.

Hi Dave!
 
    I'm glad you found a PD getopt. The catalog is coming, but slowly
as it seems all things are going these days.  They've been driving me
nuts at work lately, so I haven't had time to play with in the last
week or so. I have however found a few bad archives (i.e. a file missing
bad mod header on a file, etc..), and I'll probably send you they list
vis snail mail so you can look into it.  Okay, Catch ya later!
 
                                                     Dean

I found a copy of a PD 'optarg()' function and it worked very well. Thanks for
the reply.

I have three working online games, they are not very modern but do work.
One is Eliza the online psycologist, next is a simple slot machine game
and last but not least is foreplay, an adult q/a text thingy.

[35mSubject : MM/1 upgrade
[37mDate    : 96/07/06 12:15:49[33m

Cross posted on CoColist and Fido Echos.

This is a prelim questionair for those OS9 users and MM/1 users;

I just discussed with David Graham, Blackhawk Enterprises, the
possibility or making a revised MM/1 CPU board with basically

1. The possibility of using available multisync monitors at higher
   scan rates and more video ram.
2. Ports updated to 115k baud rates.
3. CPU with M68020 or M68040.
4. Use of more modern keyboards.
5. Retain the existing I/O board so one can update with just
   the new CPU board.
6. Ability to use more memory than the 9 meg limit now imposed.
7. Retain use of Kwindows, and OSK V2.4. V3.0 at extra cost.
8. Retain use of all existing MM/1 software.

Several other improvements were discussed but David would like
to hear from others on suggestions, comments etc first before
starting on the redesign.  He also needs some commitmant from
potential buyers and has plans for furnishing stock options
for prepayments.  David can be reached at (nimitz@delphi.com)

or as 'David Graham' on the Fido echos.
