William,
     Thanks for posting this on the MM1_TECH echo.  I had just added
the 'fidonet.mm1-tech' newsgroup to my UUCP newsgroups and it was the
first one received on there.  In fact one day sooner than on the Fido
echo.
Warren Hrach, RiBBS/RiBBS_MM1 beta sysop, MM1_TECH moderator.
PS And a HAPPY NEW YEAR to you!

the file that wont dearc ***-diffs isnt needed ,as it is for voice
generation of a old format with bad inflection as to make it
hard to understand words.... how ever the rest dearc by selective
dearcing ,by doing a "tar t (filename)" then on dir of files 
tar x (filename) file
that will retrieve the files after the bad crc error...

I have added prsnam to my downloads for MM/1 and MM/1b use.  It is in
the dir. OSKSYS.  It allows filenames with a - and can be added to your
boot file, the OS9P2' hacked version.  Or change Init to include the
'prsnam' and use that version in your boot.

    Why thank you Warren,
    Perhaps with the comming new year I can get a 68K based system.
(Enid, OK is MUCH closer than it used to be ;) ) Happy to hear that
there is a good strong cross-link out there for the machine that
supports our favorite OS.

John,
    prsnam does work nicely for me, hope it does for you also.
I have been in contact With Carl K. quite often about the MM/1b we have
We have been beta testing MGR on it and so far we can get all the
windows working but having trouble with the mouse.  Anyway thanks for
uploading those mod files.  Maybe we can get a mod player for the MM/1b
one of these days.
Warren

[35mSubject : new features
[37mDate    : 96/01/08 12:23:22[33m

I have added the ability to read newsgroups (Usenet) on my MM/1 Ribbs
system.
Included are comp.os.os9, fidonet.os9, fidonet.coco, fidonet.ribbs,
fidonet.mm1-tech.
I can add more later if enough users ask for it.
Of course the fidonet groups are same as seen in the regular fidonet
echos but they arrive at least 1 day sooner.
To read these newsgroups one needs to have his capture buffer open and
just list the filenames with the ASCII download function. The filenames
are readable using <N>umber file for listing. A help file is also
available in each dir.
