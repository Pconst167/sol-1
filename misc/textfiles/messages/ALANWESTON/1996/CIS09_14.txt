Sb: #Web Browser For OS-9 ?
Fm: Marc Tritschler 100344,2706

Is there anyone out there who can tell me if anyone has developed or is
developing a Web browser that will run on OS-9 machines with GUI's e.g. the MGR
GUI.

I would be even more impressed if a java enabled browser could be sourced.

Thanks in anticipation,

Marc.

Marc,

I read in last weeks Sunday paper (7/28/96) about a Japanese IBM computer
running OS9. The article didn't go into any detail. It mentioned two IBM
Japanese machines. One is a "1.5 pound portable computer designed to make
Internet cruising as easy as writing a letter to mom." The other is "a small
notebook that will communicate, without telephone wires, with centralized
computers."

One runs Windows and the other "uses an old and nearly unknown operating system
called OS9"

I don't know which computer runs which nor do I know if the witer (a local
guy) knows what he is talking about.

Imagine my surprise when I saw 'OS9' in this article.

Hi Frank; It's good seeing your name again 8-). I'm an old CoCo user and a
former customer (Sculpture). I loved the proggram and would love a SCSI
interface to the CoCo to hook up a HD. Any suggestion?

Hi Rich.

>love a SCSI interface to the CoCo to hook up a HD.

Can't help there but sometime in the near/far, depending when I find time
future, I will be posting a list of stuff I have for sale. From CoCo to OSK
stuff. I don't expect to get very much money for it so I am planning to package
it in bundles (whatever fits in the box etc) so that each 'bundle' would be
worth $50 or so. Otherwise it's not worth bothering with. I have a large amount
of stuff. Please don't ask for specific stuff until I get to sorting it all
out. I'll post the list here... sometime.

Thanks for asking.

Frank

I'll be waiting with bated breath 8-). I check this and the CoCo forum almost
daily.

Change that to "I have a very large amount of stuff." I just spent several
hours in the garage just trying to do a rough sort. Jeeesh the amount of crap
you can collect when your not looking...

Hi Frank, I just moved.... I KNOW EXACTLY what you mean 8-(. We spent $300.00+
in shelving material to store what we kept. I mean lt's just unreal what we
accumulate through the years. In computer terms alone I have 2 complete C-64's,
2 CoCo's (one 2 and one 3; complete with floppy drives), and 5 Amigas (2 big
box and 3 A500's). I won't even into get into the boy's game consoles. Add to
that the other miscellaneous junk the average American household collects and
you have a train load 8-\.

BUT.. That doesn't mean I won't help you get rid of some of yours <VBG>.

Hi,
Is there anyone coming from an electronics/instrumentation background?
Do you know of an electronic (fluxgate) sensor which can detect the earth's
magnetic field and provide a signal which can be interfaces to a
microprocessor.
Autopilots in navigation systems use them a lot, but I am looking for a
miniture/low
cost type suitable for portable applications.

If you are a supplier/manufacturer, please send me a data-sheet with price and
availability in UK. If you know of any published articles - please send me the
full
reference.

Thank you.
