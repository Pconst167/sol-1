I've heard of OS9 over the years and now I'm using Phillips DVI machines which
use it. Can someone give me the basics about this opperating system? It it
similar or derived from UNIX?

Hi Andy,

There's a file called OS9FAQ.TXT in Library 1 you can look at.

Philips CD-i players also use OS-9, as do many of the coming  interactive
settop TV boxes.  It's also heavily used in industrial controllers, such as
factory line supervision, suspension bridge monitoring, and even Disney rides.

It's native file system and many of its path operations seem to be derived from
Unix, but the OS itself really isn't.  When it first came out about 16 years
ago it already had much of what is considered "new" today... microkernel,
loadable device drivers, modularity, ROMmability, etc.

Ask away if you have more questions.

best - kevin

Dear Mike Ward,

unfortunately I did now overwrite the OS9MAX update for OS-9 CD-ROM creating
(the file name was OS9MAXIM.ARJ) Can you re-contruct the file with description
or must I upload this again.

Do I have to fill in the item hostname ? What is it for ?

Thanks

There is a spreadsheet for OS-9 available from a company called RTware. It's a
threedimensional spreadsheet, has much more functions than a regular
spreadsheet. It'S so versatile, it can be used as an integrated programming
environment to create realtime applications e.g. for control systems.

It's called ControlCalc. To get more info about it, you may want to contact
Rich Clarke at RTware. Their email address is: rtware@mercury.interpath.com

Sb: #Checking on dead parents
Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: All

Is there any way a child process running in user mode can generate a signal if
its parent dies. Here is my situation:

        parent processes spans child,
        parent/child communicate though shared data module created by parent,
        parent/child sync via events (event created by parent).

If the parent dies a sudden death, the child not only hangs around forever, but
even if you kill the child, the data module and the event still hang around. It
would be nice if the child could be notified if the parent dies...then it could
delete the data module (if it still exists) and delete the event.

Any ideas on this appreciated!

Bob,

>> It would be nice if the child could be notified if the parent dies <<

Since you say 'if the parent dies a sudden death' I guess you can't signal the
child from the parent, since the death is unexpected. You could have the child
check that the parent is still there, however.

It's a while since I did this, so you might need to improvise a little. Try
having the parent pass the child the parent process id. At regular intervals,
the child then fetches the parents process descriptor using _os_gprdsc(). If
the parent is dead I THINK you should get an error from that call.

I used to do a similar thing when I had problems with a process locking up on
I/O. From the process descriptor (if I remember correctly) you can get the info
normally shown by the 'procs' utility, so you can tell if all I/O activity on a
process has halted, or if it's not taking any CPU time.

Hope this helps.

Sb: #ppp
Fm: Bob van der Poel 76510,2203
To: all

Has anyone ported a ppp (point to point protocol) interface to osk?

I have seen source code for a unix implementation of ppp and it doesn't seem to
be all that complicated...but the unix code I saw created device drivers to do
this. I'm not really knowledgeable about internet protocols, or unix device
drivers to even start a port of this.

It seems that my internet provider will no longer be supplying shell accounts
and ppp will be the only access. I don't really need all the gfx stuff
available under windows...so can this be done?

It looks like a pretty big undertaking.  I believe I saw where someone said
they might put a bug in your ear <G>

I have a zip file containing all the standards for all the protocols. The zip
is about 833+ K  Would you like for me to email it to you?

It certainly can be done, but whether anyone or group would have the time to do
so is the big question.  It is one thing I would have liked to have seen on our
systems, but after taking a look at it, it looks like a tremendous amount of
work ahead.

As a matter of fact, just last night I installed Winsock and Eudora on my
brother's PC just to see if I could and to become familiar with it. I set it up
for my own account, (None of us have figured out how to come up with a complete
logon script yet - if possible) and I don't think anyone could figure out the
contortions we have to go through to get on <G>

Anyway, I went in with Eudora and got my mail, I think I had about 4 msgs.  It
was fantastic.  In fact, I happened to have a MIME- encoded file attached and
it came through automatically.  Much simpler than using my system.  It's not
that bad with a shell account, but with the rates we are getting blistered
with, you can't afford to spend so much time online reading and replying to
mail.

I've just about decided it's easier to switch than fight where Internet access
is concerned.
