Fred,
     I checked othello and it runs fine, Did you set the attributes -e
-pe on the module 'othello'.  It needs a mouse to work it and if you put
the pointer on the upper menubar in the word 'othello' you will get a
brief menu.  Sokoban does not seem to be complete as it needs a module
to create the scorefile or something.  Ogre works but it is cumbersom to
learn the keycommands it uses.
     I even rechecked the sokoban archive. Did you use the version of ar
that is V 1.2 ?  It has no other file in the archive.
     You will get a few replies reguarding books for OSK.  I find that
99% of the cmds have a built in help menu, just type say 'dsave -?"
     Make sure the othello you are using is the one here uploaded by
Joel Hegberg.  Try to ident the modules in question and see if the CRC
is good and attributes are set.  How much mfree do you have.
Warren

Hello.

The listing in the Zone 1 EchoList for this echo has expired.  The Zone 1
Backbone only carries echoes listed in the Zone 1 EchoList, so it will be
necessary for someone to assume the moderatorship and list it if it is to
remain on the Zone 1 Backbone.  There is a three month grace period to
accomplish this.

During the first month only the old moderator can list the echo.  After this,
anyone can list it.  If the old moderator is gone, then perhaps now is a good
time to hold an election to choose a new one.

For more information please consult these files:  BOFAQxxx.TXT and
ELISTxxx.ZIP, where "xxx" is the version number.  They are available from most
hubs or can be requested from 1:1/200, 1:1/201, 1:283/120 or 1:396/1.

If you need assistance, please contact Marge Robbins, 1:283/120.

Allen,
     Thanks for your reply.  As moderator of the Echo and of course a
sales rep. I am somewhat biased but even so !.
Anyway the MM/1 and its later versions is well supported and most owners
like the machine very much.  We just are slow getting software to do the

I have to admit that I've run out of RAM once on my MM/1 (w/8Meg); I was
trying to compile lout with Ultra C, and there's one file in there that
uses macros heavily to achieve the effect of inlining that won't quite
make it through.

Yes, it has been ported.  (Technically, it's OS-9000, the version that
is written mostly in C.  Moving 68xxx assembly language to PowerPC is
(or would be) a significant job.)  Does it run on a Power Mac?  I don't
know; your best bet would be to call or ask Microware.

The "can't run J" means you didn't set the execute attribute on the
file; the shell tries to run it as a shell script and the module sync
bytes start, when looked at as ASCII, with the character J.

Hi all!
 
   I just thoughjt I'd mention a problem I've run into, so nobody else
gets stuck by it. Recently I've been trying to copy a bunch of disk
which were sent to me, which were Coco Format, but was experiencing
alot of errors. Upon closer inspection, I saw that they were HD disk
formated to the Coco descriptor on an OSK box. Needless to say, I would
recommend no one do this, because it is iffy that it will work. On the
MM/1, these disks caused alot of seek errors on one drive and the other
couldn't even read them. Oddly enough, the Coco seemed to be able to
read these OK (720K drives), but the MM/1 got all munged up with these
disks. So, the moral of the story is, never format HD disk to the Coco
format! Your drive may be able to read them, but not necessarilly anyone
elses!

William,
    I will post a msg with the specs in my next post.  Note that the
price David quoted includes OSK V 2.1.  Normally the MM/1b comes with
the OSK V3.0 and that lacks the c compiler and other goodies. With the
v2.4 you get best of both worlds.  Also note you need to add memory,
keyboard, monitor card and monitor and floppy and hard drives.

Hi Dave!
 
   Thanks for finding the newsletters! I just sent your OCN disks
back yesterday (May 3) so they might be there before you have a
chance to read this. Thanks again!

Hi again Dave!
 
     Yes, the disk you sent me were HD with a Coco Format. It is
surprising it even worked if you formatted them on the Coco. My
drives can't reliably write to HD disks period (CoCo of course). When
I inserted them into the MM/1 the drives could not reliably read them;
sometimes it could, sometimes lots of seek errors. My Coco seemed to be
able to read them, so I went out to Office Depot, bought 50 DSDD disks
and backuped up your Disks to them. That solved the problem. So, yes
you can still buy DSDD but they are as much as HD (sometimes actually
more expensive!!!) and are getting harder to find, but if you buy them
bulk, you can go the mail order route. BTW, ever notice Unformaatted
disk
are now more expensive than formatted ones??!! Go Figure! Well thanks
again. I'll begin working on them this week!
