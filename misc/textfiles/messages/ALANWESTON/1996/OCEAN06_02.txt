[35mSubject : linkup12 macro CR's
[37mDate    : 96/05/31 09:27:54[33m

I finally found the magic letter combo to make a linkup12 macro send a
CR.
I really did not find myself but asked Boisy.  All that is needed is the
following '\n' directly appended to the macro.
I should have also asked what to add for a 'wait for char' and pause but
forgot those niceties.
This is differant than Kterm and Osterm which use '\r'.
This is not covered in the present docs.

Dave,
      Here is a copy of the index and read.me from syscon-ind.com.
If you see something that I don't have let me know and I can get for
you.  BTW I was told Chris Hawks is working on an desktop for the MGR
for the MM/1b and/or 306.
      Have you been able to use MGR at all ?.

Gads...you *do* keep messages for a while, don't you <grin>!! Yeah, it
sorta got indirectly put on the back-burner. However, with the recent talk
of making some changes to Scribe, I've started working on Arc again as
well...I want to get Arc working the way I want it to before starting to
work on Scribe.

I can't remember everything I was mentioning that I was going to do to Arc
and whether I got it done or not. Could you post the relevant parts of
those messages to refresh my memory? Thanks.

[35mSubject : More potential RBF fixes
[37mDate    : 96/05/23  08:20:00[33m

 This is of interest especially to Erik Tromp and Curtis Boyle...
 
 What's it worth to speed up RBF substantially?  Adding a R+W cache makes ça
HUGE difference, which Chris Dekker has already done.  Now all I've got çto do
is add that code to the main-stream Nitro RBF.
 
 In addition, there are 2 other things I'd like to try, both involve the
çallocation bitmap.
 
 One: Keeping a cache in-memory of free sectors in the allocation bitmap. ç
This would take 2 pages out of system memory for each hard drive (not
çfloppy), but would make RBF do a 'best-fit' instead of 'first-fit'
çalgorithm.  This could also be coupled with additional code to allow
çsegments to contain more than 1 allocation bitmap sectors worth of
çsectors... but I don't know how feasible that is.
 
 Two: Spread the allocation bitmap across the disk.  This would involv a çnew
FREE, FORMAT, DCHECK, etc.  I didn't think of this myself, but had a çfriend
describe it to me when setting up my Unix system.
 
 The idea is that you split the allocation bitmap up across the disk, and çtry
to put all of one file in the region handled by a sub-component of çthe
allocation bitmap.
 
 In the extreme, you could have the bitmap spread across the disk in
1-çcluster sections.  So each 512K section of the disk would start off with ç1
sector of it's own allocation bitmap, DRASTICALLY reducing seek times çfor
file create and delete.
 
 In fact... if I fixed RBF to re-map sectors 1-256 automatically, FREE çand
DCHECK, etc. wouldn't even know that the bitmap was spread across the çdisk. 
The only problem here is re-formatting your disk to the new method,çand
re-writing RBF to handle this form of the allocation bitmap.  I'll çhave to
study it more to see if it's workable (and simple to do)

Can someone tell me how I can get a hold of Rick.  I don't have a delphi
account or internet access.  I sent him mail and it was returned with a
change of address so I resent it and that was returned also.  I called
information for his phone # and he is not listed in milwaukee under his
name or CoNect.

Any help would be appreciated.  My Fast232 blew again.  probably the
16550 again, but not sure.  It doesn't insert in my multipak well and I
guess it wasn't sitting quite right when I turned on the machine.  I
can't get it to iniz or supercomm to bring it up.  I'm almost ready to
give up communicating with the CoCo III,  I can't get any thing reliable
past 2400 baud under OS-9 no matter what I do.


If anybody has a list of all the patches for 19200 under OS-9 both
hardware and software. I can check out what I'am missing.

I suppose...hadn't thought of possibilities like that <grin>!! Actually, it
seems to me that it would be a pretty daunting task to try to account for
all the possibilities of capitalization in names...the code for the checks
would be longer than the rest of the program <grin>!!

Plus, how do you code for names like "Bob van der Poel", where capitalizing
the "v" and "d" is incorrect, and "Dick Van Boven", where capitalizing the
"v" *is* correct <grin>!!

You should...they sound pretty good. Just don't try patting yourself on the
back...you'll hurt your arm trying to bend it around like that <grin>!!

It sounds like you should consider seeing if you can find a C compiler
somewhere. Programming sounds like something you like to do, and learning C
will bring you in line with the rest of the world. There's nothing *wrong*
with Basic09, it's just that C was *designed* to be easily portable between
platforms, so utilities you write in C for yourself on the CoCo can be
taken to other computers should you change or "add on". As well, if you
convert your RiBBS utilities to C, they'll be more compatible with Eric's
"latest, greatest" version of RiBBS <grin>!! The only problem is that the
CoCo C compiler is hard to find...and may be costly if you *do* manage to
find a copy :-(

If you have scribe y you will rememberr the configuration file that set all

of the functions calls are from the 'grfx.l'.
 
A '306' is the OSK box with a Motorola 68306 CPU that Kreider Electronic is

[37mDate    : 96/05/24  14:40:00[33m

Here's a snippet of test code that I've been playing with.  Does anyone
have a good explanation as to why it will recurse only 124 times before
erroring out?  The error, BTW, is #57 - System Stack Overflow.
The curious thing about this routine is that no extra memory appears to
be allocated from the system or global map, regardless of the data &/or
module size of Recurs1 (I 'padded' it with several hundred lines of
dummy code at one point).  This, to me, is a good thing.  As well,
giving a memory specifier (aka: "recurse #32k") has no effect on the
maximum number of levels of recursion.  This, to me, is _not_ a good
thing. :-)

procedure Recurse
dim number:integer
dim updn:boolean
number:=0
updn:=true \(* up
run Recurs1(number,updn)
end

procedure Recurs1
param number:integer
param updn:boolean
print "pre  ";number

The whole reason for this exercise is that I'm attempting _yet another_
approach at writing a duplicate message / reply linkage scanner for
RiBBS.
Due to the fact that up to 32767 records have to be addressed, my only
real options are routines that work on secondary storage (disk) - unless
_every_ RiBBS sysop can guarantee a maximum of 512k free ram to pull the
data into memory. 8-)  I've tried variations on the explicit sorting
theme & the results were pitiful.  I've tried insertion sorts,
shellsorts, & non-recursive/recursive quicksorts.  Of these, the
recursive quicksort gives the best time of ~25 minutes on pre-ordered
data & 90+ minutes on semi-random data - both on ~4700 records.  (Keep
in mind I'm running a Nitro'd system with a bloody _fast_ hd.)
Because of this, I've changed tracks & started experimenting with
b-trees & so far things look promising.  Unbalanced b-trees are
horrendous, giving times of 95+ minutes & max branch length of 169
records (building the tree from scratch & working on my current message
base).  Balanced b-trees (AVL-trees, actually), OTOH, give better branch
lengths (~13 to 20), but the non-recursive algorithm I came up with is
bog slow because of all the internal housekeeping it has to perform.

Any ideas? (to my question at the top of this message, that is <g>)

Erik, your error (which I figured) was because of your RUN statement in
"Recus1".  Remember, Basic09 remembers the 'parent procedure'.  You're
simply filling up Basic09's buffer.  I made the following changes to
"Recurs1", and ending w/o error "post 123"...
 
I changed PRINT "pre "; number to:
1 PRINT "pre ";number
 
and RUN Recurs1(number,updn) to:
GOTO 1
 
I hope this helps.  I'll save the code incase you need me to do anything 
else.  ;)

Sounds like you're using an integer for keeping track of your seek

How's this for a few ideas?

op1:=false \(* default = file is closed
 
on error goto 999
 
open #path1,"/r0/f80a2120.pkt":read \(* change as needed <g>
op1:=true
 
repeat
 seek #path1,offset
 get #path1,junk$
 shift:=substr(chr$(2)+chr$(0),junk$) \(* $0200 = packed message prefix
 if shift>0 then
  count1:=count1+1
  offset:=offset+shift+13 \(* skip 14 bytes of FTS-0001.016 message data
  seek #path1,offset
  read #path1,mdt$,mto$,mfm$,msb$,mat$
  print " posted: "+mdt$
  print "     to: "+mto$
  print "   from: "+mfm$
  print "subject: "+msb$
  if left$(mat$,5)="AREA:" then \(* no areatag if netmail
   print "areatag: "+mat$
  endif
  print "    msg #";count1
  print
 else
  offset:=offset+size(junk$)-1 \(* allow for 1 char overlap in GET
 endif
until eof(#path1)
 
close #path1
op1:=false
 
999 if op1 then
 close #path1
endif
print err
end
 
The above procedure will scan a raw mail packet 1024 bytes at a time,
grab date/to/from/subject/areatag when found & print them.  Compared to a 
byte by byte routine it flies.
OH! One thing to watch for... the line "offset:=offset+size(junk$)-1" has 
the "-1" for a good reason.  Since the search string is two characters
($02 & $00), a message won't be recognized if the $02 happens to be the
last char of junk$ & the $00 is the first char of the next 'get' of
junk$.  The slight overlap removes the possibility of a message being
skipped accidently.
 
If you have any questions, let me know.  I just slapped ScanPkt together
a few minutes ago, so I probably missed stating some of its more subtle
characteristics.

Can't wait to test it...  I'm curious how RBF & SCSISYS will behave with
each-other's caching schemes <g>.

Caching free sectors from the bitmap is _definitely_ something I'd like
to see (as you well know <snicker>).  OTOH, altering the current scheme
of segment sizing could be, well, "iffy".  As an example, I installed a
730 meg drive on my system & due to an idiosyncracy in CBM I had to set
my cluster size to 16.  This, in turn, means that I get a max of 32768
sectors per cluster.  I've not tried to set my cluster size any higher
because 65536 sectors per cluster is the next highest step & that doesn't 
seem to be 'clean' when you consider that a segment's sector count is an
unsigned 16-bit value.  Essentially, I fear the possibility of making a
_big_ mess <g>.
Back to bitmap caching for a moment.  When we were originally talking
about the whole idea a while back, the idea of keeping track of 'largest
contiguous block of clusters per bitmap sector' appeared to only take 256 
bytes per device (255 actually, since LSN0 isn't part of the bitmap). 
Where does the extra page per device come in?  If it's for keeping track
of the 'start' of said block in the bitmap sector, why bother?  I would
think it to be more economical memory-wise to just physically seek to it
& find out manually.  After all, if you're going to use a block of
sectors & you know which block they're in, you can find out exactly where 
the block starts when you go to allocate it.  (If the extra page isn't to 
be used for this, just ignore my tirade...)

AD> a  new FREE, FORMAT, DCHECK, etc.  I didn't think of this myself, but

Hmmm...  Personally, I'm not ecstatic about this idea.  In the extreme,
trying to salvage a logically damage HD would be damn-near impossible. 
Can you imagine trying to figure out where file fragments are if you
don't even have a relatively undamaged bitmap to work from? <ouch!> 
Another thought comes to mind.  What happens if sector n of the spread
out bitmap happens to fall on a physically flawed sector?  Will you allow 
for a 'fudge-factor' of offsets to re-located bitmap sectors?

the above-named programs 'hard-coded' for _any_ pathlist (aside from

Even though this is the first I've seen of this thread, I have a few
_major_ items on my personal ARC wishlist:
 
1> Support of the newer (later than v5.12) compression algorithms.  The
ARC utilities we have now (dearc/os9arc) will only handle 'stored' (type
2), 'packed' (type 3), 'squeezed' (type 4), & 'crunched' (type 8).  The
newer ARC archivers are now capable of creating a 'type 9' (title
unknown) format that we can't touch.
 
2> Pass error status back to the shell for better control via shell
scripts & calling programs.  The current versions of dearc/os9arc
'swallow' the error code which makes life difficult when attempting to
add appropriate error responses in mail bundlers/unbundlers.
 
3> Better user interface.  Refer to _any_ good OS9 archiver for an
example.  My personal favourite is LHA v2.11's ability to direct 'burst'
files to directory other than the pwd.  As an absolute minimum, add the
abilities of testing member file integrity, extract to stdout, & store
directory structure of member files.  (Storing directory structure _is_
valid for ARC, isn't it?)
 
4> Built in wildcarding for extract & compress.
 
5> When extracting files, set the file's last modified date according to
the data stored in the archive header.  It's there, why not use it?
 
How's that for the beginnings of a wishlist?  I can probably come up with 
a few more points given time... <g>

To paraphrase... "Huh?"  RiBBS v2.11 is being written exclusively in Asm
& Basic09.  The only things left in C at the moment are the kermit
transfer engine(s), file request processing, & the mail
bundler/unbundler.  Of the aforementioned 3 things, the last two already
have Basic09 replacements on the way.
The main reason for this is... <you're gonna laugh> ...I never bothered
to sit down & learn C.  I tried, I really did.  But the whole nonsense of 
having to write source, pass it through god only knows how many levels of 
pre-processors & such only to have a compile bomb after 10 to 20 minutes. 
Bah-humbug! <g>  With Basic09 & Ved, I'm all set.  Edit in one window,
pull the source into Basic09 in another & let'r rip.  (I admit to having
a phobia of Basic09's lovely line editor <puh-lease!>)
As well, I'm of the opinion (right or wrong) that Basic09 is more suited
to OS9/6x09 - from the standpoint of efficiency of memory usage, right
down to the ease of coding.
One of my favourite episodes with the C compiler was a couple of years
ago when I was all hot & bothered about learning C.  Imagine my surprise
when the same piece of source would work perfectly when compiled with one 
set of libraries & trash my system when working with another set.
I still fiddle with the C compiler every once in a while (probably an
hour or so a month), but I'm at the point where productivity counts more. 
At my current state of knowledge, what would take me several days or more 
to write in C & could probably do in less than an hour in Basic09 (or
several hours in Asm).  Umm.. we're talking writing time, not processing
time, eh? 8-)
Nevertheless, I _have_ to learn C at some point.  At the very least, we
_desperately_ need ZModem for RiBBS (primary importance: mail runs,
secondary importance: user file transfers).

 You really ought to try to get on internet, at least E-MAIL. I have a FREE 
E-MAIL account at SID here in Atlanta (770)612-1500. I don't have internet
access, that costs, but E-MAIL is free (30 minutes/day).
Once you get on E-MAIL contact Brother Jeremy at revwcp@delphi.com.
Brother Jeremy works closely with Rick and can contact him for you.

    Well, Lesseee,
    when one is unfortunate enough to see such an error in C ("****
STACK OVERFLOW ****") during run-time... it's usually because one is
surpassing the alotted amount of memory reserved for the stack, and
would overrun the data area. Very easily seen in recursive programming.
I don't think there is a way of fixing this with B09, but C does offer a
way around this (you change the size of all the areas).

Your point about hardcoding a directory location is a good point. Several
times have I had to use 'ded' to change that location. 
 
I would even go so far to suggest that '../dir' be use. That way I could have
my data files where ever I want. Or use a config file would be beter that way
I could have the data files buried several directories deep if I so desired.

On my CoCo system, i used a program called optstart. it allows you to
hold down certain keys to alter your startup file. normally ribbs would
come up automatically, but with optstart i told it i can press the SHIFT
key while startup is running and it will not start ribbs.

I would boot up without running ribbs, run smap and note the system ram
thats left, then start ribbs and run smap again to see how much ribbs
wants for startup (remember during fidonet access such as unbundle and
such it will grab more) then try starting multivue and see how much it
takes up. You will get a better idea of how much each program wants for
itself.

Actually for a long time I have heard of the problem of not being able
to format a floppy with less then 6k of system ram. It never effected me
and I used to debate that with others.... until I realized I had a
Sardis controller and it doesn't need 6k of ram. If I switched back to
the Tandy mode volia, i used to hit the same problem. Sardis designed
the software so it would use the Internal RAM chip to format a floppy
disk and not the system ram.

No, I'm using a REAL number for the pointer.  Maybe I just thought it
was erroring out due to the number.  Maybe there's a EOF error I'm
missing.  Anyways, the error trap works, and nothing has barfed since
the first trail run.  I'll study your code and see how I can implement
it into FixName.  I'd love to speed it up!

I imagine it would.  Right now, FixName skips the first 54 bytes of
"junk" in the '.pkt'.  Then it starts searching for a CHR$(13) & three
CHR$(0)'s, which denotes a new message.  Then it jumps 5 bytes, and
finds the TO: person.  It fixes their name if needed, and writes it back 
out.  It does this for each message, until it reaches an EOF.  Then the
next .pkt is processed.

How is using a GOTO slower than making Basic09 pull a "separate" program

[35mSubject : recursion in basic09
[37mDate    : 96/05/28  09:56:00[33m

Erik,

Given the program you provided it wouldn't be needed to use recursion.
if you stopped the program while it ran (before the error) and used the
command "state" (i think) from debug in basic09 it will show the parent
program and all the called routines. Basic09 cannot handle more then 128
called routines and using a memory modifier (#32k) only increases user
data space. it would be similar to gosub's without returns

recursion is useful to save code in programs that need the same code
with different values. For example, a program im writing in basic09 is a
game of minesweeper (those with windoze will know what I mean) when the
player clicks on a blank spot on the map, not only willl that spot be
uncovered but all spots around it (since they cannot contain mines) but
if uncovering a nearby spot is also blank, the program will recursivly
call itself to clear around that blank spot. (the routine that clears
around a center point) The routine originally needs three parameters,
the map of the field, and the x,y coordinates or the spot that needs
clearing around. so minesweeper calls blankspot like this

(from minesweeper)

....

run blankspot(map,x,y)
...

now blankspot clears around the x,y coordinates, but lets say it finds
another blank spot, it merely calls itself again with the new coordinate
such as....

run blankspot(map,x1,y1)

therefore the original x,y are preserved. map is common to all called
procedures therefore there is only 1 copy of map's variables in
basic09's memory. new values are created for x1,y1 and its also possible
that blankspot will be called several more times until it no longer
finds blankspots outside its original coordinate. each called routine
just dies off after it clears around its spot.

Does that help?
Mike

Here is another idea that might help accomplish what you want. Have you
ever looked at my code for the basic09 program called "mbackup" ?

it shows how to use more then 64k for data storage. by swapping in and
out 8k or larger segments of memory. you might be able to use that for
storing data to be sorted and such.

It uses nothing but standard system calls (no nitros-9, no vrn, etc..)
and you can find out with one system call how much memory the user has
available. Plus it doesn't matter how fragmented it is.

I documented how its done in the doc file thats included with the
archive.

I see by your tag line that you are in the Dallas/Ft Worth metroplex. I would
like to ask you to find someone for me.
 
There is/use to be a group called DALTRug (Dallas Tandy Radio Shack Users
Group) that met once a month at the InforMart on Stemmons Pkwy in Dallas. They
even had a BBS (now disconnected).
 
Some of their members were very active on these echos. Right after the Chicago
Coco Fest in April  of 95 everybody seems to have dropped out of sight.
 
Would you ask around or attend a Super Saturday meeting at the InforMart and
see if you can find someone from that group.
 
In the Ft Worth area, if you know a Richard Dean, he might know something and
also have things you want. Some of the DALTRug might have some of those items
also.
 
I would appreaciate some help finding this group. THANKS.

 I'll agree whole-heartedly with that.  I tried using C on my Coco, and çit
was just too slow: both the compile AND the resulting programs.  The çCoco C
compiler is OLD, and generates TERRIBLE code.  I've now got 2 sun ç3/60
systems up and running, and am running Gcc on them, 20MHz 68020's, çwith 4Meg
of RAM.  GCC of a reasonable-sized program is about as fast as çBasic09
parsing a large file..
 
 On another note, I have been frustrated with some of what Basic09 does
çlately.  Is there any point in writing a Basic09 -> ASM compiler? The
çinitial stages wouldn't be too hard, as it would only support the çsimplest
command set.  More complicated things could be added later.
 
 Benefits?  I don't think that it would be terrible faster than Basic09, çbut
the programs would be a LOT smaller.

    I would be happy to see you speed up RBF, anything to speed up the
BBS (RiBBS) is appreciated.  If the the cache works, that would be good. 
I tried the CC3Disk cache system years ago, didn't seem to do much as I
recall.
  
    The other changes sound pretty formidable and would keep you coding
for ages.  This FAT system is outdated now and the High Performance
systems showing up here and there work very well but at a cost of module 
size.  I don't mind backing up and reformatting my Hard drive to set up
a new system, but what about all those floppies that we all have.  Need
to be able to read them in the old format.  The OS/2 HPFS still uses
FAT for floppies.  But look at the memory cost of the OS/2 HPFS, about
300-400K.
    If you could help some of us out to get our RAM disks working under
Nitro 1.22, that would be a big help. I'm still stuck at 1.16 cuz of no
Ramdisk in 1.22

   Well we weren't talking about the Arc archiver. Its an old very
useful Level 1  file copy/backup utility by Carl K. as I recall.  But
maybe someone will take your wishlist and run with it.
   Pick it up here if you can afford the 50 cents next Sunday.  I use it 
to copy directorys and up to full disks.  Its best feature is backing up 
directories, it won't overwrite a file unless it has a newer date.  It's 
how I do my HDisk backups.  It zips through a directory until it finds
something new.  Makes new directories as required and other good stuff.

   Just so everyone out there knows, these volunteers spend their own $$ 
to move files all over the U.S. and Can.  A year ago there were new
files every week, now I don't think anything has been distributed for
several months.  New files are being put on  .rtsi.com  but our

Hi William,
   
    I didn't quote your /t2, but I see two differences in mine,
   wnd=03   and   xtp=03
    I haven't gone back to find out why I set them to those values but
I believe it was advice from Erik Jan Tromp
    I don't remember modifying Sacia, my CRC is A4CFE0.  If it hasn't
been modified it must be the only thing in my Bootfile that that way.
  
 Quote: -
      Using the Tandy RS-232 pack; a FD-502 (or 501,can't tell unless I
disassemble my system at the moment; a MPI, with all the ints tied
together; a SSC, unmodified (rarely used), and an interrupt modified
512K CoCo III, 68B09E cpu. one of these days I'll see about a 16550afn
and see about modifying SACIA to use it. (Got permission to distribute a
16550 version a while back when I was tossing around the idea of
creating my own version of the "fast232" (before it made it to market).
Then again I've also thought of a CPU / 16550 combo that would look like
a 6551a to the CoCo.
 
 End Quote:-
  
   If you install one of the new Clock modules (Ed. 9), you can remove
the interrupt fix (Diode hack or line from the RS 232?). However that
won't fix your speed problem.  Your modem is set for Hardware handshaking
I hope, that is important at the higher speeds.  I may have commented on
that earlier tho.  I think I also commented that  you will need a 6309
and Nitro to really get reliable high speeds.  The other occasional
problem is a 6551 which isn't too good.  Installing a 65C51 has often
been recommended.
  
   Thats about the sum of my suggestions for now.

I think it would be great and I've often wondered why someone who could didn't
write one a long time ago! I would be great to not have runb loaded when you
run B09 stuff! If you do it can you do one for the MM/1 too <grin>?!

Hello Merv!

Replying to a message of Merv Curley to Brent McLaren:

Here's who I have at the moment. If any see's an error please correct me.

Hello Merv!

Replying to a message of Merv Curley to Brent McLaren:


 MC>    Well we don't need a file hatched out, just a message like the
 MC> Periodicals listing  or my list of Ribbs systems which is posted for
 MC> Ribbs sysops.    I don't have any idea who all are distributing
 MC> Files. Probably only Tim knows that.    Is it Tim, I'm not sure now,
 MC> <G>. Merv

It could be me. For a while I was pulling files off or RSTI and sending them
out via the OCN but I was dissatisfied with the cost/service ratio of my ISP
so I dropped it and consequently the file distributions dropped too. Now I'm
sure that I'm not the only person who had/has internet access as well as
access to and OCN bbs so almost anyone could do the same. 

Now having said that, I'm getting another provider so I'll try to resume the
distribution.

Later, Tim!

I have most of the stuff you asked for except the hard drive adapter. I do 
have IBM type hard drive cards but no adapter (like the Burke&Burke) at
the present time. I don't have RIBBS but that is available from Warren Hrach
on this echo. Give me a call at (770)469-5111 to discuss prices and shipping.

You might try looking up the following good CoCo supporters:

Lee Veal, 8809 Linda Lane, Rowlett, Tx 75088
David Wordell, 833 Woodhaven Lane, Grand Prarie, Tx 75052

Both of these guys were/are very active!

... What did you do before this message appeared ?

Lee Veal and David Wordell are exactly the 2 people I am lookinf for. As you
know they were not at Atlanta or Chicago last year.
 
I tried the DALTRug BBS and the number is disconnected. I contacted the sysop
of the BBS that keeps the MetroPlex BBS list and he could not help me with any
information.
 
Wonder where they have gone or what happened. We occationally saw Wayne
Thompson and Ober Bower here and they worked for Texas Instruments.
 
Hmmmmmm!
