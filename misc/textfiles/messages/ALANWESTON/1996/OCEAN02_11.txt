For all those MM/1b users I have installed a download dir for
files that are currently available for all updates including
latest version of MGR that is working.
I will be getting the latest index from Carl Krieder of his
releases and ftp'ing those new files asap to my MM1b dir for
downloading.
These are the same files he has available on syscon-intl.com
but by no means all inclusive.  If you need something that
I do not have just leave E-Mail on my BBS.
In the dir MM/1B misc I have a copy of his latest index that
is everything he has so far.

I have an internet E-mail address (warren@ocnbeach.esnet.com)
and also (warren@cg57.esnet.com) Either ends up in my UUCP
E-Mail incoming.
 
My BBS is 'Ocean Beach BBS, (619) 224-4878 1200-16,800 baud
8N1 24 hrs.
You may logon and fill out the application and if using
OS9 in any form you get online validation and can download
files on first call.

Tim,
     RiBBS_MM/1 does not have freq working yet.  So I sent it email to
the address you gave above.  UUencoded about 90+k.  You should have way
before you read this.

I have been testing some new utilities on both my MM/1 and our
local usergroups MM/1b.

Speedisk (demo version) works on both systems. I have that in
my OSK utils dir for downloading as 'speedisk.lzh'  It is 
a nice program to test a disk for fragmentation and defrag it.
Diskmaster also works on both systems and is nice for checking
a dir for files, copying, moving or listing a file.
I have that in my OSK applications download dir.
