Despite the fact that I have recently moved and my computer systems are in a
state of disarray I do have my COCO together and used the mail09 mailing list
for my Christmas cards.  Trying to interest my youngest in computers and the
COCO is still an obvious starting point.  Very simple machine under RSDOS,
promotable to powerful operating system under OS9 (Sardis non stop controller &
NITROS9 make it a smoother operating machine)  Shares the desk with a TC70
(apart today) and, of course a DOS/WINDOZE (cyrix 5x86 at 100 mhz).  Still play
gantelet on the COCO from time to time.  Still dig out old software and if I
ever retire (yes, I'm almost that old, the COCO will stay as a software
tinkering toy although its function there has been taken over in large part by
the TC70.  Wish there were more hours and that I had a larger desk.  Oe thing
the COCO never was - space efficient.

Hi Bob:

   I too have moved and my set up is in disarray. That's why it took me sooo
long to respond. BUT, I understand about the CoCo taking over. kinda like the
old component stereos 8-)

I would be interested to know if anyone has hooked up an os9 machine to a HPLC
or to a Spectrophotometer with any luck. I get the dubious pleasure of working
with Messy Dos at my work place. I think that Gwindows would be a good platform
to hook up to a HPLC. Also under Gwindows does the mouse work well with Umacs
for all or am doing some thing differently than I should? I eagerly await
responce. Thanks in advance for all the help Tom F

What specifically are you having trouble with?

Which version of the emulator are you using? Coco2 or Coco3?

Are you trying to boot a double sided image?

Let us know, and we'll try to help.

I have a spare 512K upgrade. I bought a bare board from Radio Shack when I had
trouble getting my PBJ upgrade to work. My PBJ upgrade now works fine so you
can have my Radio Shack board for $25.00. I will even throw in the memory for
nothing. I fix computers for a living so have access to lots of parts.

I used the grfdrv patches to allow a 25 line display.  All I get on my windows
is the top line moved up one line and a blank line on the bottom.  I used xmode
to add the extra line....

Interesting note:  Supercomm _Does_ give me 25 lines.  No other program or the
windows alone recognizes the 25th line.

Any cluse folks?

Neal,

OS9TCP has one big disadavantage, they only have a version for OS-9 2.4, not
for 3.0. I've heard they're working on a new version.

I don't know about the availability of OS9TCP in your country. In Germany
OS9TCP is available from a company called ELTEC.

Here is their address:

ELTEC Elektronik Mainz GmbH
Galileo-Galilei-Str. 11

 > Hey, its been a long time, Jim,
 Sure. There are still a fair number of MM/1 users around.  Some have left CIS
and hang out on the Delphi OS9 forum, but there are a few of us still here.

 My MM/1 has grown since I last talked to you.  It now has a 68340 CPU (sort of
a modified 68020), 9 Megs RAM, a CDROM and a tape drive along with 3 Hard
drives of various sizes.

 It runs TeX/LaTeX2E, and Ghostscript, so I can produce and read Postscript
documents as impressive as any PC or Mac.  (With another program I wrote to
produce Postscript drawings on the MM/1).

 It sends faxes -- I'm working on receiving them GRIN,-- but if I do that, the
486 next to it will lose another job.  If I come up with an OSK scanner
interface and a Graphical WEB browser, the 486 will get buried in dust bunnies.
(Or at least dump messydos completely and run LINUX and OS-9000.)

 It keeps records for my business (SCULPTOR), and allows access from a surplus
cheap terminal and modem at the office.

 Does all my CIS and DELPHI forum and email message work.

 Finally, and best of all, it allows me to snicker quietly at those who think
Windoze-94.9996 (Pentium) is the ultimate system.

  All I can say is *WOW*!  Sounds like you jacked up the MM/1 emblem and shoved
a full-blown high-end Unix system under it! <G>  What'cha using for video?

 >>...snicker quietly at those who think Windoze-94.9996 (Pentium) is the

  Heh, heh!  Been there too!  Although, as a WIN95 user on a 100mHz P5, I _DO_
enjoy going to the store and shopping for hardware/software that I can just
come home and 'plug in'!  For someone without a CS degree and a lot of time,
this makes more sense than my MM/1.

  I was looking to see if there was enough activity that I could offer my MM/1
for sale, or if I should just quietly box it up and stuff it in the rafters.
What'cha think?

 > The 68340 and 8-meg Ram were purchased at COCOfests, the software is
available here and/or on the Delphi OS9 forum, plus at least one ftp site.  The
68340 upgrade turns the machine into an "MM/1a".

Still the old Tandy CM-8, with a Magnovox for a backup.  That is one of the
things that the SVGA machines can do better.  Ghostscript on my MM/1 is pretty
slow compared to the Linux version on my 486.  I can see a whole page of
Postscript on the MM/1 screen, but anything under 12 point type is a blur.

There is a new machine out, being called an MM/1B by some, that will use a VGA
card and monitor.  Should be capable of better graphics with the right card and
drivers.  It also uses IDE hard drives. I think the basic motherboard goes for
about $400.

  For the REAL details on the new machine, and what is available
  for the MM/1, EMAIL

      and

 > Sure - post an offer here.  If you like, I will tack it on the Delphi OS9
forum for you too. - Maybe on the COCOLIST also. I can't guarantee it will
sell, but I can assure you that there are still a lot of COCO users around, and
some of them are looking for a bigger OS9 machine (if the price is right GRIN).

  Yah, good grafix and resolution are a must if you spend any amount of time on
a computer and have any vision difficulties!

  That would be great!  Let me put together a sale ad and get back to you.
Shipping might be a problem if the CM-8 goes with it tho.

Bill Wittman (Wittman Computer Products) and David Graham (Blackhawk) are MM/1
reps.  Paul (Ward) left the scene a long time ago.  Mark (Griffith) is still
around, even checks in here now and then, but he is no longer active in the OS9
area.  Kevin (Darling) also checks in here now and then, but he is really busy
with his job -- programming OS9 boxes of course.

Kevin (Pease) made the 68340 and 8-meg upgrades I mentioned earlier.  The new
WCP-306 aka MM/1b board is produced by Carl Krieder.
