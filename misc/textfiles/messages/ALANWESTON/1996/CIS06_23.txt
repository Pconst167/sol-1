Is any one aware of a gcc port to OS-9000?

Hi,

The math.l library I use converts floats to double
before computing floating point calculations.

Would you mind sending me a MATH.L file that
directly compute on floats or the source code
of this standard library.

Many Thanks.

I am running OS-9 V2.4.  I have an SCF driver driving a 68681 UART.  Is there
any way to set this bear up to drive a 38.4 KB serial port.  I've seen some
documentation where it tops out at 19.2KB.

Thanks for your help

I have had problems with A certain Seagate 1 GB Fast SCSI II drive. I have had
fairly frequent error #175 using MVME162LX and OS-9 Version 3.0.2.  Hotline has
thought about it and basicly ends up saying that that particular Fast SCSI II
drive may not  work properly with OS-9. I will likely get around to trying
MVME162LX and OS-9 V 2.4 also. Sorry, I'm not where I can get to the actual
drive model number.

Oh yes, error #175 is "Hardware damage has been detected".  I have tried three
Seagate drives of the same model and two different MVME162LX boards, I continue
to get this error.  I assume it is an OS SCSI driver and hardware
incompatability.
