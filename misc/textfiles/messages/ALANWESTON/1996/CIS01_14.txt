Kevin,

Just curiously, who do you work for?  My company, Interactive Engines, built
the user interface for TELE-TV's Stargazer project on Stellar One Navigator
1000 boxes on DAVID.  We also have other projects we've done on the Stellar
box.  We're always interested in what others are doing on DAVID.

John,

There's no reason why it _still_ shouldn't work.

Judging from the terminal programs you've mentioned, I'm guessing you're using
xmodem or ymodem protocols for transferring files. If you're having better luck
with sz/rz, I'm betting it's with ASCII files. Sounds like terminal settings.

Set your terminal program to 8bits 1 stop and no parity.

Next ... let's check your CompuServe terminal settings. Log on and at the first
prompt you get, type  PRO and hit return. This will drop you into a "command
mode" area. Then, issue the command  TER PAR  (short for terminal parameters)
and hit return. Pay close attention to what your parity setting is set to. Mine
is NONE.

That done, move to a forum library and attempt to download a file with xmodem
protocol. If that works, move up to xmodem1K and ymodem. Keep in mind some
systems (and some terminal programs mix these two up.)

Let us know what happens.

No easy way...

If you use the curses package, it has built in support for this. What it does
is set up a binary tree (or is it a try??) which contains the codes for the
f-keys and other special keys. Input is parsed though a lookup and translated
to special values for these keys (as I recall they are 16 bit values > 256). It
is easy enuf to do similar things without using curses. Matter of fact, Ved
needs to do the same kind of trick when reading keys.

Yes, it's just a matter of doing it.  My idea is to read in the termcap values,
then try to do a tputs()..

 > Matter of fact, Ved needs to do the same kind of trick when reading keys.

Yah, I figured you might have been through this if not in ved, then somewhere
else.. BTW.. I'm having to do some "re-learning" in ved.  I had not remapped
many of my commands onto the function keys, and I did that the other day so
now, I keep wanting to hit that ESC key <G>

I don't remember if I explained what I was doing with the function keys.

I got signed up with my "expensive" server.  It is a Sun system, and uses the
Sun function key mapping..  which my termcap gives only f1-4, but these are
given the same as for vt100.

They use the F-Keys for Help, Display Commands, chd (on some menus at least),
and Exit.  I can type in the combinations quickly and get results, I may just
live with that for a while.

My server allows for a text-based system, it provides Lynx and Pine for us
automatically.

I had hoped to use the system for telnetting here and to Delphi, but one
problem has arisen with that, it seems.  I use InfoXpress, and if someone sends
me a binary file in email, I fear that it will be a problem.  Normally ix
starts to read a file, and I assume that if it encounters binary data, it
aborts and then downloads it.  However, what is liable to happen is that it
will start the dload, and either the data will be converted to ascii - no 8-bit
xmit on Internet, right?  and either ix will dload a corrupted file and then
delete the original..  Am I right on this.

From the looks of your posts, I assume you don't use ix, but if so, how do you
handle it?

I would really hate to give up ix, now that I have become spoiled by it.

The traffic here is bearable, but I have been reading some forums that need
something like this.  It just makes things soooooo easy...

Thanks for your response, Bob.  I'll work on my connect some more.  To tell the
truth, now that I have Web access, I may throw in the towel and get a system to
do the graphics..  My curiosity is about to get the best of me... <G>

I think that if you do a cis session via ix and the internet then ix will fork
'telnet' on the host. Then it is just like a hard link between your computer
and cis...the host becomes invisible. If you have trouble uploading you'll have
to enable the -E flag for telnet which disables the interupt character.
Downloading should work fine.

Yes, this is a 8 bit world...I think the only thing which isn't is internet
mail. Mind you, I see the occasional piece of mail with IBM gfx characters in
it, so I suppose that some of that is 8bit too.

Do you mean IX will do it on its own?  Getting my assumption from a recent
message from Bill Dickhaus, Message #21230, that you need to do this with a
logon script.

The host we use is a menu-driven system in text mode.  I have not ironed out
all the nuances of it yet.

I didn't know that.  I thought about all internet stuff was 7-bit.

I didn't really know how the FTP stuff was handled.  I assumed it was sort of
an automatic encode-decode thing between the sites.

OK, so it is going to be difficult, and eventually impossible, to use CIS with
a CoCo or any other OS9 machine. That leaves the internet.

I can log on to the net with a shell account, but it expects an ANSI or, at the
very least, VT-100 terminal. Anyone know of, or willing to write, a suitable
terminal program for OS9/OSK? The combination of ANSI terminal with a program
like TIN (running on your server) would at least give newsgroup access to the
OS9 community.

STerm doesn't work, at least with my server, who doesn't allow the choice of
terminal type. But I understand that even for those that do, the standard
programs like lynx, tin, pine, etc. need a cursor-addressible terminal.

From what I'm getting, it appears that _some_ forums will maybe remain ASCII
for a while.  I would  think that the OS9 and CoCo forums would hold out as
long as they can.

Maybe I hit it lucky, my server is set up for vt100.  My system, operating
under G-Windows, does vt100 by default, so it works quite well.  Of course, it
does not support colors, but I can live with that for now.

Isn't there a "vt100" program somewhere?  It seems like I saw it somewhere
once..

I patched in Sterm to do the function keys.  My arrow keys work, so that helped
some, but the Tin and Pine programs that my server use allow for using control
keys and regular keys for lots of the functions.  I think one allows maybe the
"j" key to do the job of the down-arrow (I think).

You are in luck if you use a CoCo, after 6 years Vaughn Cata has upgraded

2.11.

OSTERM now supports full vt100 and works rather smoth.

To: Bill Dickhaus 70325,523 (X)

Bill,

I read with interest your message #21235, giving an example script to log onto
CIS using telnet.  A few more questions from a dummy, since I am contemplating
attempting it myself.

One thing that you mention is the SevenBit option.  If you have this turned on,
does it preclude ix from downloading attached files in email?  This is one of
my concerns.  If it does not, would you not lose them?  I am worried that IX
might attempt a download and then delete the file. You often don't know when
you are going to get binary data.

Someone said, or I understood them to say, that everything on Internet besides
e-mail was now 8-bit, but your statement about SevenBit leads me to believe
otherwise, and, using STerm moments ago, I tried to download a short file and B
protocol would not do it, so I assume binary is still impossible?

Also, I'm a little hesitant about just dropping carrier with my provider upon
logoff.  I guess you could put in a fake hangup string in there.  Is a logoff
script possible?

If telnet is available for Delphi, I would like to be able to log onto my
provider, telnet to Compuserve, then to Delphi.  It would be OK to be left on
the server after logoff.  Of course, it wouldn't be totally automatic this way,
but I normally stay close by anyway.

socket programming, aber seit ein paar Monaten bin ich dabei, ein
Kommunikationsprogramm zwischen einem VME-System und einem PC auf dieser Basis
aufzubauen. Die VME-Maschine soll MSR-Aufgaben uebernehmen, der PC fuer das GUI
und Visualisierung verantwortlich sein. Das Problem Vermeidung von Polling habe
ich geloest, in dem ich Signale und ss_sendsig() verwendet habe. Performance
ist nicht so berauschend (Problem liegt wohl hauptsaechlich auf der PC-Seite,
zwischen zwei VME-Systemen habe ich bis zu 250 MBaud erreicht) aber
funktionieren tut's jetzt schon mal.

Hallo Alpetkin,

danke fur Deine Info! Martin Raabe hat mir leider noch nicht geantwortet, er
scheint sein email nicht so oft zu checken. Hast Du vielleicht eine Addresse
oder Telefon-Nr. von der Firma?

Gruss,

Hallo Jost,

 bei dem extremen Messie-Aufkommen hier ist es sicherlich nicht verwunderlich,
dass Antworten etwas laenger brauchen :-). Anscheinend sind alle privat hier,
ich jedenfalls, keiner will sich so richtig outen mit Firma, Tel.-Nr. oder so.
Na ja, ich glaube die Tel.-Nr. darf ich verraten, Du musst Dich allerdings
verbinden lassen. Die Nummer des Vertriebs ist: 06131-918-100. Ja, es ist der
VME-Hersteller in der Rheinland-Pfaelzischen Hauptstadt, dessen Name mit E
anfaengt. Ich habe auch in der letzten Message was falsches gesagt, faellt mir
ein. SS_SSIG funktioniert mit der ISP2.0 von MW aber -leider- nicht mit OS9TCP
2.0. Da muss man wohl oder uebel SS_SEVENT einsetzen. Man kann aber ein Event
fuer alle Pfade verwenden, und dann nach Ueberpruefung des Puffers einlesen.
Eine Select-Funktion ist ebenfalls in der Lib enthalten, das habe ich aber noch
nicht ausprobiert.

 Gruss,

My TCP/IP package on OS/9 requires me to have the hosts file in my /sys
directory but has no provision for use of a domain nameserver.  Is there any
way I can take advantage of my institution's nameserver.  It would cut down
considerably the size of the hosts file.

Neal,

OS-9 uses the hosts (as well as the other network database files, i.e.
networks, protocols and services) file only when it builds the inetdb data
module. OS-9 actually doesn't use the files to get IP-Addresses, it only uses
the data module. This allows embedded systems to use ISP aliases, even if they
don't have any disk/file managers/devices installed. Usually the data module is
created on startup using the idbgen utility from within a network startup
script (startisp). You can tell the idbgen utility to use a different directory
than the default directory by using the -d=<str> option. <str> could be the
directory on your nameserver, assuming the drive is already mounted (requires
NFS client installed). Of course this creates the the 'egg and hen' problem,
what comes first? You would probably need a small local hosts file just for the
nameserver, and then use the hosts file on the nameserver. By the way, the
default directory for the hosts file should be /dd/etc, not /dd/sys.

Regards,

Jost

Jost,

     Thank you for your reply.  Yes, my hosts file is in the ETC directory.
From your reply, I gather that the OS-9 implementation of TCP/IP does not make
use of the nameserver feature that has been in general use since 1991.  Most
unix systems have a file named resolve.cnf that contains the information needed
to get the IP address from the nameserver.  Some client systems such as NCSA
Telnet and MacTCP place the domain and nameserver information in a
configuration file so there is no  need for a hosts file to exist on the local
computer.  I noted when I scanned the SOURCES file there was a UDP  port
associated with nameserver but found that there was no RESOLVE file.  I was
hoping to avoid downloading the nameserver hosts file during generation of the
inetdb data module.  Our institution's local hosts file is over 200K and the
general hosts file is almost 1M!  With the proliferation of networks, I really
need to use the nameserver.

Hi Neal,

wow, your hosts files are really big! You don't have to download them to your
OS-9 system though. If you use NFS you can sinply mount the harddisk of
Nameserver as a device for OS-9, then you can use the -d option of idbgen. But
- do you really need all the entries in your nameserver's hosts file? You may
get a problem with the inetdb getting too big. Unlike Unix, OS-9 has no virtual
memory! Maybe you should create your own hosts file containing only the server
aliases you really need.

Sb: Need ITV Programmers
Fm: Craig German 72752,2336
To: all

Interactive Engines is hiring software product developers and consultants in
the D.C. area.  If you know of any exceptional individuals who are just itchin'
to be part of the interactive television market in an aggressive startup,
e-mail me at 72752.2336.

Background
----------

We designed and implemented the authoring system being used in the Bell
Atlantic Stargazer Interactive Television (ITV) trial in Northern Virginia and
in the Telecom Italia VideoMagic ITV trial in Rome, Italy.  We assisted in the
design of an Internet advertising product for another startup firm.  We
designed, produced, and implemented the ITV-home computing application that
Novell showed in their CEO's keynote speech and in their booth at Comdex.  And
we have the ear of many more Fortune 500 and large international companies
regarding ITV services and products.

Our products are currently targeted at ITV service providers who have a need to
produce robust, compact, high-performance, engaging multimedia applications on
a regular basis in a cost-effective manner.  We understand the needs of this
community from past experience and market research.

Our ideal consultants are at ease with client interaction and respect the
philosophy, "The customer is always right".  Our consultants need to be
self-starters and problem solvers who believe in producing quality work.
People and project management skills are a huge plus.  Fairly substantial
travel is involved in most of our contracts, especially upon delivery; travel
schedules are often somewhat unpredictable.

Our ideal product developers are eager to stay on the cutting edge of
interactive distributed application technologies.  They're always coming up
with ideas that everyone else thinks are crazy until a company goes public for
billions of dollars 3 months later with the same ideas.  These same developers
recognize the value of disciplined, methodical software implementation.
They're also in tune with the needs of developers that will use our products,
without giving in to "feature frenzy".

We'd like our consultants and developers to be experienced with at least
several of the following technologies:

multimedia application production
embedded applications
networked multimedia applications
distributed object architectures (CORBA)
interactive television application development
collaborative multimedia development
GUI development tool design
languages (C, C++, Java)
multi-tasking OSs (Windows, UNIX, Mac, OS-9)
database design
application porting

Please send resumes through e-mail.
