Hi Dave!
 
   Thanks for finding the newsletters! I just sent your OCN disks
back yesterday (May 3) so they might be there before you have a
chance to read this. Thanks again!

Hi again Dave!
 
     Yes, the disk you sent me were HD with a Coco Format. It is
surprising it even worked if you formatted them on the Coco. My
drives can't reliably write to HD disks period (CoCo of course). When
I inserted them into the MM/1 the drives could not reliably read them;
sometimes it could, sometimes lots of seek errors. My Coco seemed to be
able to read them, so I went out to Office Depot, bought 50 DSDD disks
and backuped up your Disks to them. That solved the problem. So, yes
you can still buy DSDD but they are as much as HD (sometimes actually
more expensive!!!) and are getting harder to find, but if you buy them
bulk, you can go the mail order route. BTW, ever notice Unformaatted
disk
are now more expensive than formatted ones??!! Go Figure! Well thanks
again. I'll begin working on them this week!

I have put the latest versions of MGR from Carl Krieder for downloading
in my MM/1b support download section.
Filenames are ;
mgr.tar.gz    898 k
part1.tar.gz 1002 k
part2.tar.gz  540 k
I also have a copy of tterm.lzh in my osktel section for OSK systems.

I think some of the problem in MY reading 720k disks between my coco and MM1b
was head alignment. I noticed that older coco disks (5 or 6 years ago) read
better that ones formated last year. My 3.5 drive was new 5 or 6 years ago.
 
Yes I noticed the price difference between formated and unformated disk. About
a month ago I saw an ad for 100 disk for $49 with a $40 mailin rebate. Alas I
had just bought 200 and could not justify the 9 cents apiece. 200 will last me
a year. 
 
I have not passed by a postoffice to mail the newsletters yet, 5-May.

Hi Dave!
 
  If I'm not mistaken, you asked about the Computer/TV converter. I know
you asked for PD, but there are a few commercial versions of what you
ask. I believe Jameco/JDR and a few others carry them. Hope this helps!

I am in Texas. Wonder why I havent seen this messge. I guess the MM1
echo doesnt get distributed correctly all the time.
 
There was a guy sending out letters wanting to buy a used MM1 in March
or there abouts. I think everone on the OS9UG mailing list got one.

Yes, you can buy 720K floppies--this is good, because my Clavinova
CVP-89 wants them as well as CoCos.  I found them at Office Max.

Do you really really want to build one?  Look in Computer Shopper; it's
easy to find them for sale.
