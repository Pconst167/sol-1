Disaster...

Windows shattered,
Glass exploded.
The houses tumbled,
Then imploded.
The demon eyes,
Of wicked fate.
The earth's own love,
Of it's own hate.
The moving clouds,
That know no time.
The screaming drowned,
One by mind.
Children saved by mothers death,
The others saved by ones own breast.            
The humble fool,
The humble slave,
Taken by,
One great wave.
The others wait,
And stare to sky.
To see their fate,
For which it spy!
