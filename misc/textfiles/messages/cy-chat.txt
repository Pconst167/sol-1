Okay anything written by W. Gibson . This is the man that started it all
he has written four books. Neuromanser, Count Zero, Burning Chrome, Monlisa
Overdrive. Read these first then if you are a roleplayer get CyberPunk V2.0
This is the best. I have play them all and this does the matrix right.

 Ps. ShadowRun Is a good Idea with bad rules I suggest using the Idea in gurps 
with cyberpunk V2.0 netrunning. This worked great last weekend.

Look Cyberpunk is a way of thinking. To be a netrunner is, well to be a BBS 
caller with a rengance. All you need is a C-deck(CyberDeck) and some software 
and you just grab your balls and jack on in.....

    Know What all this is about is computer and man interacting on a higher 
level. Cyber Stuff. We have cyberware to make to a better man and chip slot to 
make to a smarter man. So Cyberpunk is just I high tech Super hero world made 
up of people with hardware build in. Think about running around on the other 
side of the screen. That's all Jacking in is. You project your mind into the 
computer using a I/O Jack that is install in your head.


OKay Now this is the setting. Now on with the show.......

People are all scum in the world of cyberpunk. You must be to stay alive. Most 
people are better armed than Rambo.... Now do we all get the idea....

              It's a concept, it's a Style!!! That is the best word to 
describe it, STYLE! It's a way of thinking, a way of acting. 

              In the not-so-far future society as we know it has been changed 
forever. The corporate structure now rules the world, making thier own laws. 
You as a punker fight for survival in this new urban jungle. In future terms 
you would be a Netrunner, one who interfaces directly with the computer and 
through it the phone NETwork (or Net), running the matrix of Cyberspace in 
search for your next fix, the next bit of info that will buy you your next 
meal, maybe even let you retire, if you don't get flatlined (killed) first.

              This is genre I based my BBS off of, the Cyberspace Central is a 
haven for you Netrunners to trade your info and make contacts freely without 
the pryful eyes of the Icemen (Netrunning Cops). In the earlier posts I made 
reference to movies and books, if you would like to know more about the world 
in which you are now interfacing with, I would suggest starting there. It is 
really an interesting world, one which may even be in our own future if we're 
not careful. That's also what this sub is for, the exchange of new ideas which 
which may have seemed `Punkish a short time ago, but now seems to be reality.

Intreface magazine listed some pretty good cyberpunk books & movies that were 
not found in Cyberpunk 2020.  Mirrorshades the anthology of cyperpunk fiction 
is the best source to get a preliminary education on what cyber punk is.  Bad 
Voltage is another good cyberpunk novel.  Bad Voltage has several good 
elements a GM can use in a Cyperpunk game.  Finaly Cyberpunk 2020 is on its' 
second edition.  You can obtain an update sheet by mailing R. Tailsorian games
