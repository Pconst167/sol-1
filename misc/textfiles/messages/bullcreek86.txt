Subject: OH, NO!!!!

The HD20 has crashed.
        
Happened this evening as I was trying to get my newly fattened Mac 128
hooked up.  I was going to let it share the HD20 with the Plus, and move
the BBS over to the old machine, so that it would be truly full-time.
        
Alas, I brushed the power cord, and the HD20 is history.  It's a hardware
problem, there is no getting it even initialized.  Everything is lost.
        
While most of the board and most of its contents are backed up, there is
also a lot that probably will be lost.  I have no idea how long it will
take me to get it put back together.  Right now I'm so bummed out I don't
even want to think about it.
        
The board right now is just in a holding pattern.  The only thing active
is the message sections -- no file transfers now because, for the moment,
there is nothing to download.
        
Be patient.  I'll get it back up ASAP, and then I'll be looking to you all
to do a lot of uploading -- you're my best backups.
        
Sigh.

Subject: Help needed on filterProc in ModalDialog

I am trying to inspect a keystroke in an enabled editText item in a modal
dialog.  When my filterProc is called from ModalDialog, it always receives
a null event and this is _after_ the character has been placed in the
editText item.  As I read Inside Mac, my filterProc should get called with
each event before it is acted on.  I am using Megamax C 2.1 and have the
new ROMs.  Any help would be appreciated.  Ron, 836-2514.

Do you mean that "theEvent" which is passed to the filterproc is NULL?
I've used filterprocs extensively and have never seen this happen.
Presuming your source code is correct, I'd recomment stepping through
with a debugger and making sure that what your procedure is getting is
actually the event. Could be the Megamax glue code. I don't have the
new ROMS, but I rather doubt that is the problem.

I get a valid EventRecord pointed to by *theEvent (valid time, mouse
location, modifier but the what field (event type) is zero, a nul event.
And the starnge fact is the the keystroke or mouse event is already posted
to the editText field before filterProc gets control.

Subject: Reply to OH, NO!!!!

Thanks, Ron.
        
The message listing probably would not be of much help, since the message
files are in a strange format, and there is no way to convert a text file
into a file readable by the message sections.
        
The file listing may be a big help, though.  I still have most (but not
all) of the actual files backed up -- my biggest worry is how am I going
to recreate the HD20 directory as it was (required since all of the file
transfer sections require a complete specification of the pathname, and
there are TOO many files to rekey all of that manually in any reasonable
period of time).  I am going to try tonight to get a minimal file transfer
capability reinstalled in the board before I leave town on Wed. morning.
If that happens, I would appreciate an upload of your file list.  Hang on
to the messages -- I'll give that some thought to see if there is some way
to get them back into the board.  It was suggested to Watson that he put
some such capb
ability into the next version of Host, so it may be here soon.

Thanks.  Once the HD20 is repaired, it will probably take me a couple of
days (depending on what is going on at work) to get things recreated.  I
will then post a message soliciting uploads, together with a text file
listing everything for which I am unable to find backups.

   One way to mount messages into the board would be to upload them one at
a time with the message headers intact.  Not a good way to go about it,
and would have to be coordinated to avoid duplication, but, as you say,
there's a lot of history in there...

Subject: Solution(?) to filterProc

After a lot of trial and mostly error, I believe the problem is that
Megamax C passes a pointer to a value of -1 for itemHit to the filterProc
function.  If filterProc returns False, this is ignored, but if it returns
True, the -1 for the item causes a problem, of course.  Luckily, I don't
need to know the item, just the event type of keydown.  My initial
function returned if the item was on I wasnt interested in and, of course,
I wasn't interested in item -1.  Probably a bug in the C glue.  I'll call
Megamax tomorrow.  When I return a valid value for itemHit and True, all
is OK.  Thanks for your hints and pointers.

Subject: large bitmaps

al-  i've got a problem you might be able to help me with.  i need to be
able to scroll a document ala macpain 1.5.  i could just set up an off
screen bitmap and use copybits BUT the bitmaps i'm using can be very large
(up to 32K bits on a side).  that probably will take all the memory my mac
has if it will fit at all.  the only saving grace is that these bitmaps
are quite sparse.  the only thing i can think of is to keep only a part of
my picture in a large offscreen map and update the bitmap so it always has
the current port's view plus maybe a screen full on each side.  got any
suggestions?      thanks,   allsn

Subject: Reply to large bitmaps

Yeah. Use ScrollRect for the portion of the bitmap on the screen. Keep
a duplicate of the whole thing in an offscreen bitmap. Use the bBox
of the update region returned by ScrollRect as the rect to copy from
offscreen to onscreen. The only semi-tricky part is to keep your
rectangles aligned -- obviously the coordinate system of the offscreen
bits will be different from that of portRect. The easiest way I have
found to handle this is to leave the portRect coordinates zero-based,
and keep around a global variable which represents the topleft corner
of the screen in the coordinates of the offscreen bitmap (and which is
updated with every ScrollRect). Hope this helps...

Subject: I'm back!!!

Just came in a few minutes ago from what has to be the worst flight I've
ever been on.  An hour on the ground at the end of the runway in St. Louis
waiting for the thunderstorms to clear, another half hour on the ground in
Houston because they weren't letting anyone land in Austin, and all the
while they weren't serving any drinks because the waitresses couldn't hold
on to them.  A real roller coaster ride.

I'm very pleased by the fact that everything is still running here, and
even more pleased by the fact that there is so much support out there in
the BCBBS's hour of need.  Hang on.  Everything should be back to normal
soon.

I got a call yesterday at the office that Apple is going to pay off on the
warranty -- even though I was a week past the expiration date.  Will
wonders never cease.  Anyway, it turns out that it was in fact the drive
that was bad -- a $400 bill.  The drive should be back here by the middle
of next week (I hope) and then I can really begin the job of
reconstruction.  I will do some of the rebuilding this weekend, and that
will be transferred back to the HD20 when it arrives, so you may begin to
see some changes in the next day or so -- not right now, since my
immediate plans are to get as drunk as possible in as short a time as
possible.  Tomorrow is another day, and this one has been an extremely
long one.

Thanks for being there.....

This is _not_ vaporware!  We are taking orders and making these starting
at the date mentioned above; facilities are just being expanded for the
construction of these drives, so orders will be backlogged for a while.

i think i'll keep an offscreen bimap that in three windows high and three
wide so that at any given time, the current "view" will be the windowfull
in the center.  when the user uses the hand to move around, they will be
able to move smoothly and quickly to in any direction up to one window
(the limit of the mouse movement anyway).  when the mouse is released in
preparation for another scroll, the offscreen bitmap will be updated so
the current portrect view will again be in the center.  what you think?

Sounds like a reasonable approach. Re "smoothly and quickly": you're
gonna have to do some optimization to get this to happen. For example,
the "grain" of your scroll has a LOT to do with determining its speed:
ScrollRects to even word boundaries are much faster, for obvious reasons.
Scrolling 1 pixel or 15 pixels is up to 6 times slower, if I remember
the results of my tests correctly. But these are things you kinda have to
learn as you go... Good luck.

Subject: News.

The HD20 is due to get back tomorrow, and I expect to do some big-time
file copying over the next couple of days.  By the weekend, the board
should begin to look like its old self again.

A couple of menu changes.  Access to the X-rated section now requires that
you go through a validation procedure where you certify to me that you are
at least 18 years old.  I don't want any angry moms hauling me before the
PTA.

Some of you may have noticed that the time limit has been reduced to 45
minutes.  This is something about which I had circulated some messages
just before the crash.  The board was getting crowded, and I felt that
most users would appreciate fewer busy signals and less time.

I said that I would take care of 300 baud users, and I got some
suggestions about allowing extra time for uploads and in cases where there
is a REALLY big file out there.  I think 45 minutes should be enough for
even the biggest file, but I have added a new function which should handle
any problems which may arise because of the lower time limit.

In the ser Preferences section from the Main Menu, there is a new
option: equest additional time.  This will allow you to ask for more
time in increments of 30 minutes, up to 90 minutes.  The new time limit
will remain in effect for the remainder of the call.

A record is made of each such request, and if I find that anyone is
abusing the privilege, they will receive a warning note telling them not
to use it any more.  Persistent abuse will result in excommunication.

Those of you working with HFS on a hard disk should check out "HFSDir0.98"
in the Utilities section.  Like the earlier version, this will give you a
printed listing of all files on an HFS volume, with nice indenting to show
the nesting of folders, and with all finder information presented.  This
version will also allow saving the output to a text file, so you can
pretty it up in a word processor.

I have seen one trick and 3 programs for checking the version of my ROMs

Which If any of the following is correct?

        $EE = Hearts
        $EA = Hearse
        $FF = Heiffer
or
        $EE = v1
        $F4 = v2
        $EA = v3
or
        yet another program (descride) tells me I have version 117, which
        when assumed to be OCTAL and converted to HEX would be $4F.
        IS that the same as $F4 or is that yet another opinion on the matter?

        I really would like to know the scoop on this folks, because I support
        a large number of Macintosh users around the world.  We would like to
        know what version we each have in our upgraded or Plus off the shelf

I saw the 20 meg "Magic 20" actually working at Macproducts today.  It is
real and it is fast. It appears to be at least as fast as a Hyperdrive.
It was hooked up to a Macplus. They will do a scsi interface for a 512 for
$200.  It will probably take a few days to get either the hard drive or
the scsi as they are just now starting to build them. My only complaint is
that they are still a little too high priced.

Someone on USENET or Delphi -- I forget which, it is too late in the night
right now -- posted a rather concise and (I assume, since no one replied
negatively to the post) accurate program to figure out which ROM's you
have.  If I remember correctly, the only changes to the ROM's were for a
new Sony driver that worked a little better (I do not know in what manner
it worked better, however) with the new DS drives.  ROM's are supposed to
be split between revision "A" and "B" only; ask around at one of the local
developer meets and you may get some better answers:  sorry I could not

Uh, "too expensive"?  Mike, if you tally up all the physical component
parts -- I am not including the software development costs -- you can see
that no such animal like "150% profit margin" exists around there.  Call
up Rodime, find a hefty power supply, get a decent enclosure, and you will
easily go over the retail price MacProducts is advertising for.

Not one to get all riled up over this; I just do not think you may have
seriously tried to put one together yourself -- it is not an easy nor
cheap task considering that the suppliers are charging up to the hilt for
SCSI stuff as soon as they realize that Macintosh people need it badly.
What do _you_ think is a good price?  Have you found a comparable drive
for the same price?

Allow me to state one of the problems with SCSI drives versus IBM-standard
drives (which I am assuming you are comparing these drives to):  volume.
The simple fact of the matter is that IBM drives are made in much more
quantities than SCSI-equipped drives; the fact that it inherently costs
more to implement SCSI (a more layered protocol than ST506) onto the
drives (more chips, design costs, etc.) also excerbates the problem
considerably.  There is another side to this:  ST506 is slightly slower
than SCSI, and even slower than a new up-and-coming protocol that has its
roots in SCSI but is even faster than its parent.  Read last month's PC
Magazine on the new Core drive.

Basically, we are all paying the price for newer and (possibly) better
Winchester drive technology.  As that master of sci-fi Heinlein said:
"TANSTAAFL".  If you know how to build a fast SCSI drive, you have found
the proverbial "better mousetrap" if you also know how to build it cheaper
than anyone else (including MacProducts).  But I would wager that you will
find the going tough, and many engineers may agree; the economics of the
_current_ situation just do not work to our advantage -- but wait until
six months from now...(:-)).

Now that Mr. Moore has kindly taken to the trouble of telling everyone
else around here that the hard disk truly does exist, I would like to have
others on this board take a look at it and offer your impressions,
comments, and suggestions.  It is too tiresome and time-consuming for me
to go around every board in town that is related to the Macintosh in one
way or another and to keep people updated on the development of this drive
(there are _always_ ways to enhance any product; knowing when to stop is
the key), so I will just use Bull Creek as the local announcement outlet
for now.

When you look at the drive, please keep in mind that it is an
"almost-baked" product.  There are still many more frills to be added to
make it _marketable_, but it is _usable_ right now.  What I mean is that
this is the ideal type of drive for the average Macintosh user who
requires a hard disk, but not so good a choice right now for the corporate
office that is running MacServe and requires password protection, queued
print spooling (only The Keeper does that as far as I know), and so on.

When passing judgement on the drive, realize who it was developed for (Joe
Mac User tired of shelling out $1100 -- at an Apple Consortium site, no
less! -- for 20 Mb).  There, got that out of my system:  now I hope I will
not start reading a bunch of posts comparing this against an Ethernet file
server (:-))!

Sorry Data Snatcher, didn't mean to touch a sore spot. Just to set matters
straight, I said nothing about a "150%" profit margin. In fact, there was
no mention of profit margin. You're obviously entitled to one, somewhere
in the 30 to 40% _gross_ range if it's in keeping with industry standards.
And you're right that I have never tried to put one together myself, I
don't have the technical background you do. My comment was only meant to
be an opinion and it should have been clarified. I was not referring as
much to the drive, as to the scsi upgrade for 512s. It would seem to make
good marketing sense to offer the scsi upgrade at lower than normal
margins to get the hard disk sales. Again, just an opinion, and you know
what opinions are like.... everybody's got one. Anyway keep up the good
work and try to get some sleep.

If you've been thinking about getting the Avatex 1200 baud modem

a list of all of the modem commands:  AT,D,P,T,O,A,AA,AD,A/, and Z.
Compare this list to the list for the Hayes!  If I sound mad, it's because
I am!  I spent a hundred bucks of my good hard-earned money for a modem
that isn't even close to what I need.  Thank goodness they have a 30-day
money-back guarentee!  Another example of how limited it is, the entire
users guide is less than 25 pages long, including pictures.  It also
includes a section on loading your software program and goes on to
describe how to load up different communications programs for different
computers.  Shouldn't that be something in the program manuel, not the

There seems to be a real problem with this file.  When trying to download

you're told the file is 218375009 bytes. Is it something I'm doing wrong,

First of all, the file was only put there temporarily.  It's an Excel
worksheet that I did last night - related to my work.  Soon as I get a
chance, I am going to create a private section for just that purpose, so
my job won't be showing up here on the board.  In case you are interested,
the sheet shows the revenue requirements for toll service of all the
telephone companies in Kansas.  It's a part of a case that we are fighting
at the Kansas Corporation Commission.

The problem with the "haywire" response of the system is something that
I've run across before, and has to do with the MacBinary format
recognition in Host and in Red Ryder.  I d/l'd it fine to the HP Vectra at
work (to bring it into Lotus).  If you have the "Recognize and convert
MacBinary format" option turned on in Red Ryder (or whatever other term
program you are using) and you try to d/l an Excel sheet saved as a Lotus
.wks sheet, the phenomenon that you describe will happen.

I would suggest that whenever you try to receive a text file on the board,
that you check the non-ASCII file transfer options menu in Red Ryder to
make sure that the MacBinary recognition is turned off.

On 4/17 Don Strickland left message #713 (pre-crash) about a modem for
less than $99.  I got one and here is my evaluation.  The modem is _NOT_
Hayes compatible.  It supports ATDT, ATDP, ATZ and A/ but _NO_ other Hayes
commands.  It has some other commands to support Autoanswer but the
commands are unique to this modem.  It is an Avatex 1200 model and comes
in a very nice cabinet and with a well printed, but very non-technical,
manual.  The company has an 800 number for tech support, 1-800-4AVATEX.
The unit is UL and FCC listed.  There is no speaker.  It does not support
the Hayes +++  command.  You must turn off the modem or switch to voice.
You must have the modem   off to power-on boot the Mac.  It is available
from A&J Micro Drive, 1050 E. Duane Ave., Ste 1, Sunnyvale, CA 94086.

Another note on the Avatex1200:
 -switching from 300 to 1200 isn't software controlled, but _manual_
 -there is a data/voice button, which is sort of nice...keeps the modem
  from answering the phone
 -the absence of the hang-up prefix as well as ATH can be a real pain in
 -it has the following L.E.D. indicators
  [Power],[TR],[SD],[RD],[HS],[MC],[TM],and [RI]

it's not a bad deal, if you can put up with the differences from the AT
standard.

Yeah, well, not _too_ much of a sore spot; I just kind of wonder when
people walk in, ask about hard disk prices for the Macintosh, then -- get
this -- they _demand_ a lower price because they "know" that IBM drives
are cheaper, and that "we should not try to pull one over them because of
the myth that Macintosh users are neophytes to computers" (:-)).  No,
seriously, it is not as bad as all that, but it gets close.

Apple makes the SCSI upgrades for the 512, and whatever price they set is
whatever everyone is pretty well stuck with, unless they want to go in for
third-party SCSI _conversions_.  A conversion will not give one the same
25-pin port that a Macintosh Plus does, but it still gives you the use of
an SCSI port.  With new ROM's installed, you effectively have a Macintosh
Plus, albeit less appealing cosmetically.  Depends on what you want out of
your computer.

Sorry, did not mean to come across as angry or peeved.  I kind of get

The failure was only on an HD20 that was sitting right on top of a Plus 20

received a hot tip from my Apple National Tech support person today that
led me to recover my HD20 though some Fedit 3.7 magic.  I am impressed and
delighted that I could recover the disk, however I am sorely disipointed
that the problem happened at all.   Both disks were pluged into surge

Subject: Communications Section.

I've added a new file transfer section;  "Communications" reachable with a
 command from the file transfer main menu.  Been meaning to do that for
a while, but was prodded into action by the suggestion of D. Strickland.
It's intended for RR (and other program) automated procedure files,
communications programs, and any other communications-related files.

As an experiment, files uploaded to this section will be posted
immediately.  On all other sections, they sit in a holding area until I
get a chance to look at them and make sure that they are good (i.e., not
corrupted, I'm not making an editorial judgement) files.  We'll see how
this goes, although I'm a bit nervous about having things move directly to
the d/l section without my intervention.

Thanks to all of you who have been uploading the "lost files."   There are
still quite a few things listed in the "Lost Files" file in the Reading
Room, and plenty of upload space.

I am seriously considering closing out the disk drive fund drive. The
response from some users of the board has been gratifying, but in all the
level of contribution has been a disappointment, considering the large
number of users of the board.  Should I decide at some point to invest in
an additional drive, it is certain that there will be some features of the
board that will be available to those who have contributed that are not
available to those who have not.

Mark,
        The problem is very well defined...
        1.  You have a SCSI device (Disk or other) not turned on.
        2.  You are trying to boot from the internal or DiskPort drive.
        The system should ignore the SCSI and boot from the other drive but, I
think it tries to boot from the SCSI port and waits for ever on a ready or
something.  If you just turn on the SCSI device there is not a problem, or
you can unplug the SCSI.  I can boot from either DRIVE (SCSI, HD20) as
long as there both on.  To boot from the SCSI there can not be a
system,finder combo in the other drives.  The SCSI is last in line behind
the Internal Floppy then the HD20.

        There is no real problem using the HD20 with a SCSI drive.  I asure you
though if I find new ROM's I will let all know.

Thanks for the contribution to the disk drive fund drive, and for your

I am aware of the problem with the full screen clear and Red Ryder.
(Ralph had said that one of the problems he had in sending in a
contribution is that the disk drive fund drive message was cleared by a
full screen clear such that he didn't have the screen in memory at the end
of the session).  There is really nothing I can do about that from here.
One approach would be to eliminate the screen clears in the User
Preferences/Terminal Characteristics menu.  I really prefer it that way
myself, but it's an aesthetic choice.

Another approach would be to change RR's handling of screen clears.  There
is an option on one of the menus which allows you to "Remember screens
before full screen clear" which should take care of the problem from your
end.   I'm posting this here in case others have had the same problem.

You've probably discovered the same, or maybe not.  HardSave has a bad
tendency toward LaBombas after reading a few megabytes.  Happened to me
twice tonight.  Once I got 2Mb onto floppies, the second time it had gone
to 6Mb before crashing.

An important factor here is that I was using some very old single sided
disks for the backup.  While all had initialized OK at 800K, I got about
four out of the 20 that I was using come up with a "Bad Data Mark" error
during the initialization in HardSave.  Then there were the two that
initialized OK in HardSave, but crashed during the file copying.

I'm going to try again with a couple of fresh boxes of DS disks.  The
program is otherwise impressive.

you for calling ten minutes earlier. Then you have to list all files, which

I think we may be talking about different programs.  There is a file
"Archiver" which is supposed to be a hard disk backup program.  I have
never been able to get that one to work, it either blows up or does
something similar to what you describe.

The "HardSave" program doesn't have an option to allow you to specify
files selectively by date, although you can choose to back up only certain
HFS folders.  I seems to work, and produced about 10 disks for me of
backed up material.  I think that its problem occurs when it encounters a
bad sector in the disk being copied to, although I really haven't had a
chance to try it with nothing but DS floppies.

The HardSave program gives you an initial screen with options to "Backup",
"Quit" "Help" and maybe a couple of other things.  There is a box with a
scroll bar on the right side of the main dialog which lists the files as
they are copied from the HD to the floppies.  The buttons, when picked,
put up a "pop down" menu at the mouse location.

If that description sounds like a different program from the one that you
have been using, I would recommend you try the HardSave program, it's much
better than Archiver (it works).

We are talking about the same program, HardSave.  There is a button called
"Select".  When it is selected, my oldest copy (not the one on BullCreek
or GEnie) and "Backup up files by date" is selected, there should be a
pair of selections -- From what volume" and then "From what date".
On the local copy, the messages just flash although you can read then if

Since the old messages got trashed I am going to repose a couple of
questions I asked earlier. First, has anyone with an upgraded Mac or a
Plus experienced one of the following two problems: A) You launch an
application w/o the system disk being in. The Mac signals you to put in
the disk but before you can the dialog in the dialog box blans out and the
computer hangs. B) You are asked to insert a disk, the dialog box starts
to get all wavy and the computer spits the requested disk back out at you,
requiring you to reboot. Any hints?
Having run the Describe program Mark told me about (thanks again) I now
know I have Roms 117-- just what does this mean? Did I get crappy ROMS?
Should I yell & scream at my dealer?  Also, does anyone have System 5.2
and Finder 3.2 that are supposed to get rid of all those nasty + probs?
Finally, I want to pass along a message I found on GEnie, from a
disgruntled Mac + user:
This is a short note on how to take the copy protection off of
Microsoft Excel.  First, this is for persons who have legal copies
of Excel and is not intended to promote pirating.  I bought Excel
and recently upgraded to the 800K drives and new ROMS.  I
wrote Microsoft and asked if they would trade my back up copy
for an 800K master so I could avoid the "Insert" mess.  They
refused to do it.  As a service to other 800K drive owners,
here's how to remove the copy protection.  Use FEDIT on a
BACKUP copy of Excel (just finder copy it to a new disk) and
do a HEX search for 608EBEDD, CHANGE to B1036ADD.  Write to
disk.  Now your copy will be finder copyable and will boot with
out the "Insert" routine.  While I'm at it here are some more.
Word: search for DD6084BEDD, change to DD4E71BEDD; CHART:
search for DD60DD00126081, change to DD60DD00124E71; FILE:
search for 126082BEDD, change to 124E71BEDD; MULTIPLAN: search
for 12608007BE, change to 124E7107BE. Good luck with your
800K drives!
Anthony Oresteen, Batavia IL.
I want to note that I post this as a service to those of you out there
with 800k drives and that I do not condone illicit use of this info. Hope
it helps some. Bye.

Apple has made a major release of new system software over the last couple

I have finally gotten the new system (3.2) and Finder (5.3) installed on
my system.  The following observations may be helpful.

The new finder/system seems to have some trouble with recognizing SCSI
disks.  At first, it would not recognize them at all.  After about three
tries, it finally is able to read it.  I have it set up now to boot the
system and finder off of the SCSI disk, and that seems to work fine.  I
guess it is forcing recognition of the disk from the outset.  MacServe is
no problem, although it took some juggling to get it installed and
transferred from the HD20.

There is a significant speed increase in quitting from programs or booting
to the finder.  The disks pop up like magic on the desktop.  It appears to
be achieving this speed, though, by not reading the entire HFS directory
into memory.  If you open a full folder, there is a hesitation, as the
Finder is apparently reading the folder directory for the first time.

        I received some information from Centram regarding their file
sharing system TOPS.  They expect to be shipping in three weeks.
        They allow volumes to be created on a hard disk but it is not
necessary.  Within a volume, several users on a network can share the
applications but only one user can share a copy of an application at
one time  unless it is a multiuser application.  They are currently
testing Omnis 3 multiuser and dBASE III Plus [they support Macs and
IBM PCs running  DOS 3.1].
        They claim that multiple copies of MacWrite can have different
names on a single volume and thus can be "shared."  They support file
locking as given in Inside Macintosh.
        An entire disk such as an Apple HD 20 can be shared.
        TOPS does not support the ImageWriter but does support the
ImageWriter II and LaserWriter [perhaps they are refering here
to AppleTalk support].  They don't have spooling as does MacServe but
will have a product called TOPSpool next year to allow spooling for the
LaserWriter.
        A licensed copy of TOPS is required for each computer on the
network.  There is no server -- all node's files can be shared.  They
provide no backup procedure for a hard disk.
        Retail price will be $149 for each Mac and $389 for PC (includes
hardware).

Subject: Reply to A backup program that works.

Strange experience in trying to back up my MacServe-segmented hard disks
with MegaCopy.  The root portion of the Magic30 has about 2 Mb of system
and data files.  I had a few blank floppies, so I thought I would try the
program out by copying just that MacServe volume.

Anyway, the program encountered one of MacServe's "invisible" files early
into the backup.  The invisible file looks to be the directory of the
virtual MacServe volume, or a pointer to a directory.  When it hit that,
all of a sudden there were 28Mb left to copy, and it began to split the
biggest file you've ever seen (15Mb -- the size of the largest of the
MacServe volumes on the Magic 30) across floppies.  I didn't have enough
blanks here to continue that big a backup, so I aborted.

Actually, the program gave me a disk write error on about the fourth disk.
I don't know whether it was the fault of the disk or what.  I have noticed
a persistent problem where the system will lock up when a disk
initialization fails.  The error that stopped the copying session, though,
occurred on a disk that initialized OK through the Finder.   I'm not
saying that MegaCopy crashed, though, it was ready to continue with the
copy.

I really wonder whether it would be able to back up a single file of 15Mb
in size.  That's the way that it seems to interpret the virtual MacServe
volume, as a single file.  Could it do that without getting lost?

The way MacServe works, you'd have to treat the virtual Macserve volume as
a single file. MacServe creates a file big enough to 'contain' the volume
and stores it in its own special format. As far as the Mac file system
knows, it's just a big data file until you use MacServe to mount it as a
volume.
I don't know whether MegaCopy wil handle this size (just got it ) but it
should. You can break it down with DivJoin if absolutely necessary, I
suppose.

Subject: "Disk-killers...."


An excerpt from this morning's Austin American Statesman:

Sabotage, it seems is not limited to analgesics and airlines.  Some home
computer owners, who use telephone lines to contact the thousands of
computer bulleting boards around the nation, have learned to their sorrow
that there might be a nemesis among the free computer programs offered by
many boards.  The insidious programs are known by the generic names of
"disk-killer" or "disk-bomb" and though they are not really fatal,
retrieving them electronically can result in the expensive loss of
sometimes irretrievable information.

"These things are written by some deviant people like the Tylenol
killers," said Tom Clark, publisher of the Computer Street Journal, an
Austin-based monthly tabloid for Texas computer users.  "Plain meanness
isn't cyclical," said Jim Westbrook, systems operator, or sysop, for the
private JIM-NET bulletin board in Austin.  "But these things seem to come
in cycles.  They die down, and then there'll be a wave of them."
Westbrook is an officer of the Central Texas Sysops Association, which
currently has 50 members.  He recently alerted Clark to a new disc-bomb
with the innocuous title of ARC 600.EXE.  The Computer Street Journal
published the warning for bulleting board users.

"I picked up the word on it from  sysop in San Jose, Calif." said
Westbrook.  "It had cost him a few years of accumulated information."
Like other disk-bombs, ARC 600.EXE was waiting in the open files of a
bulletin board for any computer user looking for a bargain.  Once
retrieved, however, the program automatically went to work "reformatting"
every floppy memory disk or expensive hard-disk drive connected to the
user's computer.  Reformatting erases all of the old information on a
disk.  Westbrook said one Austin bulletin board was put out of operation
by a disk-bomb.  "It wiped out all their disk drives," he said.

So Westbrook, who likes long-distance telecommunicating on the boards,
gets out the word whenever he discovers a new disk killer.  "Even if it
originates in California, it'll come here," he said.  "The time lag is
often not very long.  Austin is a very active telecommunications area."
Increasingly, commercial bulletin boards such as CompuServe offer free
programs that act as bomb defusers by electronically interrogating
suspicious software to find out if it is deadly.

Subject: Reply to "Disk-killers...."

I read that article. I thought it was REALLY misleading. First of all,
it implied that the mere act of downloading a "disk-killer" program
could be disastrous. As far as I know, this CANNOT be the case --
control MUST somehow be transferred to a program before it can kill
a disk. Secondly, in the paragraph about "system security", it quoted
the sysop of SMOF. SMOF is a TNET systems, and such systems are not
oriented to uploading/downloading -- no protocol transfer, and they
accept uploads only peripherally, if at all. The paragraph is
irrelevant to the subject of the article. The "defuser" programs
operate by searching the code of a suspect program for system calls
or direct hardware operations which might lead to a reformat. Unfor-
tunately, most "disk-killer" programs are disguised as disk utilities,
and most disk utilities would necessarily perform at least one suspect
operation. I HIGHLY recommend that you ALWAYS test any program you
download in an environment where it can't possible make any difference.
Put it on its own disk, in quarantine, until you are satisfied that it
does what it's expected to do. Personally, I never even expose much of
my system to ANY program until I know somebody who's been using it for
awhile and attests that it is reasonably bug-free (anybody remember
Finder 3.2x?). This may be paranoid, but then I don't do backups AND
I don't lose data.

Ran out of space this morning to say that I ALWAYS follow pretty much the
procedure that Al recommended with all software uploaded to the board.
The uploads are placed on a disk with nothing but a stripped-out system,
and all other drives are dismounted.  The program is then tested to see
what happens.

As a result, you should feel confident that anything that you download
from here is not going to cause problems for your disk.  Note that I am
not guaranteeing that the program works as advertised, or that
catastrophic things won't happen when you run it -- I don't have time to
try out everything that you might try to do with a program.  But at least
the program will run, and will not do anything overt to initialize disks
or trash your system.

Another way to handle the MacServe volume files is to "unselect" the
MacServe file from the MegaCopy file list and just backup non-MacServe
files in one pass.  The mount the MacServe volume and run MegaCopy against
that volume.  The last modified date on the MacServe file is not updated
whenever a file inside it is modified.  Thus backing up the mounted volume
would let you use the modified date option on MegaCopy.

CAUTION!!! CAUTION!!!
Obscure "Feature" ...
    A Macintosh must be Booted with a disk that conatins the Finder and
    the System Icons.  This is called a Startup Disk and it will appear
    in the upper-righthand corner of the desktop.  Well, there is one
    more feature that a startup disk must have.   That is it must have
    "Boot Blocks".  The Boot Blocks are written to a disk only by one
    process, that is when the Finder is used to copy the System Icon
    onto that disk from a disk that has Boot Blocks.  Once a disk has
    Boot Blocks it can be copied to make other startup disk, but if
    you create a disk that does not have Boot Blocks, then copies of
    that disk will not have Boot Blocks either and therefore will not
    work as startup disks.
    Who cares ! you ask ?  Well ... I recently received a System Update
    file (New System Version) from a source via Modem.  This means a
    new system Icon was deposited on a Blank Disk (not by the Finder).
    When I added the Finder to that disk and tried to Startup my machine
    with it, it did not work.  The lesson here is this, anytime you want
    to make a startup disk, sure ...
    1.  You make it from a copy of a startup disk that works or ...
    2.  Be sure ...
        a.)  The System Icon is named 'System' before you copy it.
        b.)  The copy is made using the Finder.

I have confirmed this feature with two developers that said "I knew that
was gona happen!"

Am I blind or does this board not yet have the new system and finder from
Apple?  No Helen Keller jokes, please!

Marty,

Apple was very specific in the software license and distribution notice
that all of the new system software was NOT to be redistributed
electronically, or by any other means, without their express permission.

Their attitude is puzzling to me, since all earlier versions of the system
software have been distributed quite freely, as far as I can tell.

I tried to call Apple earlier in the week to ask for permission to
redistribute the stuff on the BBS.  You won't believe the run-around.  I
never did actually talk to an actual human being at Apple, since I went
through this Twilight Zone chain of telephone numbers.  Call one, and the
computer voice comes on and says the number has been changed, call this
instead.  Then I called that, and the same thing happened.  Number seemed
to be incrementing by one with each successive call.  Then I got a guy who
spoke only Spanish, and I finally gave up.

Does anyone know the real, authentic number for Apple Computer?  I'd like
to talk to their software licensing department.....

Yes, the latest version numbers are Finder 3.2 and System 5.3.  The "B1"
is a beta version.  You should get rid of it, as soon as you can get the
new ones   (...fume....)

From what Centram tells me, TOPS does provide password security. Sell that
vaporware! If TOPS ever gets out there, it should be really fine ... they
promise LaserWriter spooling too!

Just read an article about call waiting in the MacWorld this morning. It
says that you can get rid of it by dial first *70 if it is tone or 1170 if
it is rotary and then the number you want to dial. The call waiting will
resume after the call is complete.

Well, I can sleep nights now.  I just got PCPC's HFS Backup and I
promptly backed up my HD20.  It took 34 floppies!  Maybe I should
think about an 800K drive.  Anyone out there know if an external
800K drive will work with my 512 and HD20?

Yep, an 800K external will work with a 512. You need the Hard Disk 20 file
to provide the driver, but if you've got an HD 20 you've got that already.
You'll never be able to boot from it without the new ROMs, though.
Do tell us about your HFS Backup. I just spent 28 floppies (double sided)
on a MegaCopy backup, and I'd be interested ina better way.

There IS no real number for Apple Computer!! And yer luck that guy could
speak Spanish, some of 'em only speak Vietnamese!
I've been dealing with Apple Computer since '79 or so. Whatcha wanna
do is find somebody who KNOWS an actual person at Apple who returns
calls, along with their personal number. Then you call and call until
that person answers their phone, which usually doesn't take more than
a day or two (oh, and DON'T believe the message center, they just take
your number and put it into the confidential-paper shredder). THEN
you can maybe get an answer.
I'm sorry, but at the moment I don't know anybody there; haven't dealt
with them personally for a couple years. You might try calling the main
number and asking for Lorrie Merkel's number...

Subject: More on PCPC HFS Backup


OK, here's the lowdown on PCPC's HFS Backup program.  It's from
Personal Computer Peripherals Corp, the MacBottom people.  To get
it, just call 1-800-MAC-BUTT with your plastic money in hand, and
for $39.95 (plus $4 2-day UPS freight) you can be backing up your
HFS system to floppies.

Like I said earlier, I have only used this on my 512K machine with
400K floppies and an Apple HD20, so I have no experience with SCSI
drives - but if the device supports HFS, it can probably be backed
up.

Backup options include entire volume, individually selected files,
entire folders, or (my favorite) all changes made since last backup.
I have about 12meg on the hard disk and it took 33 floppies -
I guess that using 800K drives would halve that to 16 or 17.

It took a good 1-1/2 hours to do the whole thing.  It seemed that
large files were backed-up first (JAZZ was the first thing copied),
so things went fast in the beginning.  But as I got to about the
28th floppy, all those little files and the drive going "wah-waah"
seemed to take forever. (Better have a MacUser in hand to spend
your time with.)

Other little nice touches are a big scrooling window that displays
your whole hierarchy with either closed folders, some open, or all
open.  Overall, I am very pleased.

Subject: PCPC HFS Backup...

I purchased HFS Backup Version 1.0 back in March 1986 from PCPC.  I think
it is great to use, although the version I have only works on 400 K
floppys.  I sent it back to Robin Devoe, Tech Support at PCPC to get it
updated to Version 1.1 (yes, I called her first) on 5/9/86.  To date I
haven't received it.  I have called them repeatedly, only to get the
proverbial run-around.  Still, I hope to see it soon!  There is a bug in
Version 1.0 when recovering your files to the Hard Disks.  This bug was
reported on CompuServe.  It has to do with not recovering the folder
information.  I really want to know if Version 1.1 does indeed work with
800K disks.  Anthony Robinson, do you have this answer?
