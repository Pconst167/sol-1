The following is a consolidation of messages I
wrote shortly after attending the IBM PS/2 Forum
at the Washington, DC, Convention Center on
April 18, 1991.
------------------------------------------------
These notes and those in following messages are from
the IBM PS/2 Forum held at the Washington D.C. 
Convention Center on April 17 and 18.
|
Before beginning to describe the sessions I attended,
however, I wish to point out that despite the name of
the seminar, the major subject was OS/2.  And, to set
the record straight once again, you do NOT need a 
PS/2 to run OS/2.  Of course, IBM would LIKE you to
buy a PS/2 and they GUARANTEE that OS/2 will run on
PS/2s.  After all, that is their primary business!
|
OS/2, version 1.3, will also run on most compatible
386 machines although earlier versions were more
picky.  And hardware manufacturers have rushed to
correct incompatibilities identified in those 
earlier versions.  IBM, of course, does not
guarantee that OS/2 will run on other vendors'
machines, however, they have done a lot recently 
to assure compatibility.  Version 1.3, will also
run on most AT 286 clones although the coming 
version 2.0 will require a 386 (this includes 
the 386 SX which runs OS/2 OK).
|
Each of the following messages will discuss topics
covered in one of the sessions I attended.  You are
encouraged to join in a discussion of the topics
and issues presented.
-----------------------------------------------------
The opening session introduced the "IBM 1991
PS/2 Forum 'Imagine the Possibilities'".  This
was a slick, multimedia event intended as an
Executive Perspective.  It was, of course, a
skilled sales pitch intended to build attendees'
confidence in IBM and IBM products.  It did
showcase IBM's PS/2 product line as well as
their thrust into multimedia presentations
and advanced systems software for 386 and above PCs.
|
OS/2 obviously plays a central role in IBM's
strategy for computing in the '90s.  They did,
of course, pay homage to DOS and Windows as a
limited platform for users who do not need a
full multitasking capability.  They also introduced
the joint venture that IBM is working on with
Metaphor.  The Constellation project should produce
a full object-oriented computing environment that
sometime in the future will run on multiple
hardware platforms.  But for today and the near
to mid range future, IBM sees OS/2 as the
strategic software platform for individuals as
well as for organizations.
|
Several themes seemed to predominate the opening
session.  These included:
|
  a. IBM's advances in audio/visual (called 
     multimedia in current jargon) computing.
     This included advanced displays; fast
     computers; powerful video adapters such
     as their new XGA 1024 x 768 256,000 color
     adapters; and special video effects 
     coprocessors (such as capture and motion
     boards).
  b. DOS is not powerful enough or reliable
     enough to serve as the platform for the
     new advances in products and applications.
  c. IBM is committed to interoperabilty of
     their hardware and their software through
     Systems Applications Architecture (SAA)
     products.  (The pull-down menus, icons,
     and general screen layout you see in
     Windows or the OS/2 Presentation Manager
     are the Common User Access manifestation
     of SAA.
  d. OS/2, version 2.0 has now gone public and
     will reach the public later this year 
     after the most extensive testing period in
     IBM software history.  More than a thousand
     Beta testers and Early Experience Program
     participants will participate in this test.
  e. OS/2 version 1.3 is a strong, viable computing
     platform NOW.  IBM has dramatically lowered 
     the price of 1.3.  It multitasks, has advanced
     Presentation Manager (PM) SAA interface and
     runs more than 400 PM and 2500 OS/2 character
     mode apps today!
  f. IBM says more than 600,000 copies have shipped
     to date and they expect the total to exceed 
     1,000,000 by year's end.
  g. The price of both current versions of OS/2 have
     been lowered dramatically in response to user
     demand!
  h. OS2 Version 2.0 will be:
     - A better DOS Than DOS!
     - A better Windows Than Windows!
     - A better OS/2 Than [the present] OS/2!
-----------------------------------------------------
     The first session I attended was titled:
"OS/2 More Than Just an Operating System"
|
[By the way, all of the slides presented
were prepared using Lotus's Freelance 
Graphics for OS/2--an excellent package
similar in concept to Microsoft's
PowerPoint which is only available in
the more limited DOS Windows environment].
|
This presentation started with the familiar
IBM slide depicting all of the components of
the Systems Applications Architecture with
special emphasis on the Common User Access
standard which:
  o  Provides a Consistent User Interface
  o  Allows Easier Learning and Skills Transfer
  o  Defines a set of guidelines for:
     - Entry model
     - Graphical model
     - Workplace environment
  o  Will Evolve to Meet Future Needs.
|
The presenter, D.L. (David) Barnes, is from the
Personal Systems Briefing Center in Boca Raton,
Florida.
|
The components of OS/2 are:
  o  Multiple Threads, Protected Mode Operations,
     and Preemptive Multitasking
  o  High Performance File System
  o  Adobe Type Manager [for better WYSWIG]
  o  Desktop, File Manager and Usability Features
|
He compared the generations of PCs as:
  o  8088/8086 machines which could address only
     one megabyte of memory of which DOS made 640KB
     available to the user.
  o  80286 machines which could address 16 MB of
     memory and which in OS/2 version 1 required
     programmers to swap 64kb program segments.
  o  80386 (and 80486) machines which can address
     up to 4 gigabytes (4 billion) of unsegmented
     memory (the flat memory model) and up to
     48 terrabytes of virtual memory.  OS/2 version
     2.0 will be a 32 bit operating system which
     can manage multiple OS/2 as well as DOS 
     programs.
|
Well, the witching hour is too near, so I'll have
to stop for tonight.  More tomorrow if you are 
interested. 
-----------------------------------------------------
Continuing from yesterday's session on
"OS/2--More Than Just an Operating System"
|
The chart on microcomputer characteristics showed
the 32 bit i386/i486 families of processors using
an operating system which supports Multiple
Virtual DOS Machines (MVDM) each of which will have
approximately 613 K of AVAILABLE memory after loading
DOS, etc.  Each MVDM will have its own CONFIG.SYS,
its own AUTOEXEC.BAT and will support drivers and
Lotus-Intel-Microsoft (LIM) expanded memory.
|
OS/2 version 2 will support Multiple Concurrent 
Applications:
  o  This requires the hardware assist of
     the 386/486 processors in order to support 
     sophisticated memory management.
  o  OS/2 uses the memory "Protect Mode"
     to give greater reliability to programs.
     i.e. To protect programs from each other.
     (If one crashes, it doesn't kill the 
     others).
  o  OS/2 supports "multiple threads" wherein
     the application is divided into separate
     processes which can run concurrently for
     better performance.  i.e. When you start
     formatting a document for printing, the
     thread can start and (if you have a long
     document) control is given back to the
     user while the reformatting continues in
     the background.
  o  Interprocess communications to pass messages
     control information and data between threads
     or programs.
  o  Multiple levels of priority (preemptive 
     scheduling) allows the highest priority 
     thread to continue processing first.  This
     generally gives priority to the foreground
     thread (i.e. to those things on which the
     user wants to focus).
|
The High Performance File System is an important
feature of OS/2.  OS/2 supports HPFS as an 
"Installable File System", which means that when
needed, new files systems can be installed to
take advantage of new devices.  HPFS:
  o  Manages large hard disks/large files in a 
     fast and consistent manner.
     - Up to 2 gigabyte partitions
     - Up to 16 partitions
  o  Built-in caching of directories, data and
     file system structures
  o  Supports Large File Names
     - Up to 254 characters
     - Extended attributes
  o  Several times faster than FAT disks
  o  Uses "balanced B-tree" methods for speed
     and limiting fragmentation
|
Adobe Type Manager (ATM)
  o  Built in font manager both for screen and
     print
  o  Provides much more accurate WYSWIG screens
     (What You See Is What You Get)
  o  Uses leading industry Postscript Type 1 fonts
     - on screen
     - to drive the defined system printer 
       (EVEN IF IT IS NOT A POSTSCRIPT PRINTER)
|
The OS/2 Presentation Manager includes a
Desktop/File Manager and Direct Manipulation of Files
  o  Uses icons to represent programs/groups
  o  Provides a program/group hierarchy structure
  o  Allows moving of items singly or in groups
  o  Provides for direct manipulation of programs
     within groups
This exists in improved form in the 1.3 version, but
will be significantly improved in the 2.0 version.
It allows true "click and drag" operations.  (I never
realized before though that I could click on a file,
drag it to the printer icon and drop it into the 
printer--but it does work now)!
|
OS/2 comes with a Dual Boot Facility.  If for any
reason you need to revert to plain DOS, you can
reboot your system with a command or icon.
|
The System Editor is a vast improvement over the
DOS line editor.  It is a full-screen SAA editor
with pull-down menus, loadable fonts, etc. but 
still puts out ASCII files.  (I'm using it now).
  o  A windowed PM application
  o  Uses keyboard and mouse input
|
There is an extensive On-line HELP facility
and complete on-line documentation
  o  Search facility
  o  Electronic bookmarks
  o  Hyper text cross references

"OS/2--More Than Just an Operating System"
-----------------------------------------------------
This is the first message about yesterday's
session on "IBM OS/2 & DOS+Windows 3.0"
|
The general session outline was:
  o  IBM OS/2 Directions
  o  User Environments
  o  Functional Comparisons
  o  Positioning Considerations
  o  Cost Comparisons
  o  Summary
  o  Demonstrations
In a one-hour session there was no way to cover
all of the desired details of this topic.  The
handouts would suggest design for a two-hour 
session.
|
First, they outlined formal agreements between
IBM and Microsoft.  They said the strategic
agreements still exist, however, Microsoft has
diverted much of their OS/2 resources into
other (Windows) projects.  The presenter, a
Mr. Bill Milam (I didn't get his card so don't
know his position), made it quite clear that
IBM was fully committed to OS/2 whether Microsoft
lives up to its commitments or not.  My note
exclaims..."IBM playing hardball in public".

At the IBM PS/2 Forum, I also attended a session
on Client/Server Computing.  This session explained
IBM's strategic concepts for how organizations will
integrate the various computing and data resources 
"enterprise-wide".  This session was not
specifically focused on OS/2 although it showed the
importance of OS/2 to enterprise-wide computing.
IBM describes Client/Server Computing as the
situation where a client computer requests a
service and the server provides the service.  For
example, in my job, we intend to provide a central
database of electric power industry information on
the Energy Information Administration mainframe
computer.  But we want to process the data at remote
PCs.  We have programs on the PCs to perform screen
manipulation, editing of data, and handling of the
two way communications between the system and the 
user.  Client/Server computing allows us to combine
the responsiveness and user-friendliness of the
PC with the high speed data processing power,
multiuser access and good security of the mainframe.
|
The objective of client/server computing is to 
provide transparent access to any computing or
data resources in the organization including:
  o  Any-to-any communication
  o  Multivendor support (imagine this from IBM!!)
  o  Interoperability between systems
IBM wants to provide end-to-end management of
multivendor systems and comprehensive service and
support.
INFORMATION SYSTEM CHALLENGES
  o  Information Viewed as a Corporate Asset
  o  Extending the reach of computing resources
  o  Expanding role of intelligent workstations
  o  Emergence of workgroup LAN systems
  o  Multivendor environment
  o  Increasing role of standards
I will not report the details of this session here
as it is a topic above the level of a PC operating
system.  However, it is clear that IBM sees OS/2 as
a strategic component of enterprise-wide systems.
Indeed, IBM stated that OS/2 is now viewed within
IBM as being as important as their mainframe 
computer operating systems such as MVS!!  That is
a dramatic statement for IBM, in my opinion and
represents a fundamental shift in their corporate
view of the world.
|
One interesting (to me) piece of information was the
existence of IBM software to support the automatic
update of software on PC workstations from a central
site in client/server networks.  That may solve a
potential problem we had identified in C/S -- that
of keeping the client software up to date and in
synchronization.
-----------------------------------------------------
This last week, I attended the IBM OS/2 Forum 
at the Washington Convention Center.  Probably
the most impressive product I saw was the 
Describe Word Publisher from Describe, Inc.
This is a word processor designed especially for
OS/2.  It uses the advanced features of OS/2 
to provide WP with unparalleled performance.  
It is really fast, has true WYSWIG using the
built-in Adobe Type Manager Features of OS/2 
to manage fonts, and, most impressively, uses 
multiple threads for its processes.  Using 
multiple threads, it is almost always able to 
return control to the user immediately after 
starting any process.  The started process 
itself continues in the background, but in 
the meantime, the user can continue to perform 
other functions in the foreground.
|                                 
To me, it appears to be the most dramatic 
improvement in the state of word processing 
since the introduction of Word for Windows 
moved us into the WYSWYIG arena.  Compared to 
Describe, Word for OS/2 is a sloth -- as Word 
is just a slightly adapted Windows application 
rather than a native OS/2 application.
|
An example of the threads is that Describe 
has a very advanced spell checker/thesaurus 
capability.  Specifically, it does not suffer 
the delays normal to spell checking (at least 
in Word).  It almost instantly displays the 
first candidate for correction and continues 
to check the rest of the document in the 
background while you are considering the first 
suggestion.  Furthermore, it displays the 
thesaurus entry right away and fetches the 
definition of the word as well by using 
another thread.
|
I intend to invite the Describe folks to demonstrate 
to the Windows and OS/2 SIG in the next couple of 
months.  Would any of you be interested in attending 
this demonstration?  We meet on the fourth Wednesday 
of the month at 7:30 PM in Rockville at the Monroe 
Street offices of CPCUG.
|
Meanwhile, I've posted several messages summarizing 
some of the presentations at the forum.  You are 
welcome to join us in the OS2 Conference.  The 
assertions being made by IBM are that the    
new OS/2 2.0 will be:
- A BETTER DOS THAN DOS
- A BETTER WINDOWS THAN WINDOWS
- A BETTER OS/2 THAN OS/2
