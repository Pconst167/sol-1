      Voice Mail Hacking...
      by Aristotle

     There are four models of the
Genesis Voice Mailbox Systems (VMS).
They all have the good VMS features,
like voice data compression, ability
to send messages to other users, user
definable passwords (I believe up to
10 digits), user definable opening
message, ability to review message
when recording, and a separate phone
number for each box.
 
          How to Hack the VMS
 
     The first step is to find the
voice mail system.  The easiest way to
find a system is to look in the yellow
pages under telephone answering
services and/or equipment companies.
I found a system in Louisville,
Kentucky that was listed with the name
Voicelink.  Its number is
502-429-9200.
     After finding the VMS, you must
find out what type of system it is.
There are many different types, each
with their own unique characteristics.
If you find that the system is a
Genesis system, look into it.  Chances
are you will be able to get on easily.
     A Genesis system has the
following distinguishable
characteristics:  1) If you hit "0"
during the announcement, it will
prompt you for the password.  2) If
you hit "#", it will go to a phonebook
system.  The phonebook is used to look
up users' boxes by spelling out their
names.
     When the target Genesis system is
found, do the following:  1) Find a
mailbox with an announcement that
says, "I am taking a message for
mailbox number XXX."  2) During this
announcement press the "0" key and
wait for the password prompt.  3) At
this prompt, press "0" again.  This is
almost always the password for the
unused box.  If it is not "0", then go
o the next open box.  4) Now that you
have control, change your password and
follow the friendly directions.  It is
extremely user-friendly so you should
have fun.

Marijuana Grower Shakes DEA
By Kurt Saxon
Seq'd by Mad Scientist
Hackers Exchange (201)/997-8746


     A while back a good friend of
mine was arrested for growing
marijuana in his home.  This surprised
me as I hadn't thought he was into
drugs on any level.  It turned out he
just needed the money.
     What interested me was the
brilliant method he used to grow
plants indoors and the system which
should have insured his immunity from
being arrested.  His downfall happened
to be his own daughter-in-law.  He had
showed the setup to his son and he, in
turn, told his wife.  The son and
daughter-in-law got into a quarrel and
she snitched on Larry.
     Many indoor growers have been
told on by their electric companies.
The Halide lights so commonly used,
drawing from 400 to 1000 watts each
really shoot up the electric bill.
This makes the utility company
suspicious so they notify the DEA.  H
is cost was only about $5.00 per
month.
     After examining Larry's setup the
DEA agents swore to the judge that
Larry's four-and-a-half foot tall,
beginning to bud, plants were six
months old.  They were only nine weeks
old, from seed.
     The DEA agents also estimated his
units cost several hundred dollars
when they cost under $75.00 each.
     The agents talked to Larry's son
and let slip that Larry's was the
slickest operation they'd ever raided
and they could never have done it
without an informant.  They also
indicated they were scared as hell
that the method might get out to the 
general public.  So remember, this is
our secret, yours and mine.
     The newspaper story below is to
illustrate, not only how lucrative the
growing of marijuana can be, but the
necessity of keeping the operation to
yourself.  If you study the article
you'll realize that there was no
burglary.  Someone close to the
Jonses, with a grudge against them, or
as a competitor, faked a burglary and
told the police.  No burglar would
have written, "Ha  ha busted" or would
have left the loot by the door.
Whoever turned them in was afraid of
retaliation so faked the break-in.
     Let this be a lesson to you.  If
you do anything without social
approval, no matter how clever, tell
no one.  All the respect you might
gain for being clever is not worth the
risk of a jealous or self-rightous
informer snitching.
     If Larry's idea appeals to you,
tell no one.  Don't even tell the one
you wholesale it to.  Also, don't sell
it to users.  Your best bet would be
to find someone who sells it and
wholesale it to him.  Tell him
something to the effect that you have
a cop friend in  some distant city who
sends it to you to sell for him on
occasion.  This way, even the one you
enlisted to move the product would not
suspect you of either growing it or
having a regular supply which would be
found if you were to be raided.
 
Police find "pot" farm in house

     BOSTON(UPI) - John and Linda
Jones may want to extend their
vacation.
     Policemen investigating a
burglary at their home while the
couple was away found an elaborate
marijuana farm, a built in irrigation
system and about $250,000 worth of the
drug on the third floor.
     Authorities confiscated more than
85 pounds of high grade marijuana from
the home, police spokesman Jane
Sheehan said Sunday.
     The two, both 34, will be charged
with trafficking more than 50 pounds
of marijuana when they return home,
Sheehan said.  The police have reason
to believe the Joneses are on
vacation.
     The sophisticated marijuana farm
was discovered Friday as the police
were investigating a report of a
burglary at the single-family home,
Sheehan said.
     On the top floor of the
three-story building, the police found
at least 54 high grade sensimilia
plants and a complex, timed irrigation
system capable of watering the crop
for weeks at a time without
supervision, the police said.
     The farm included water pumps,
fertilizer filters, humidifiers,
ultraviolet lamps, irrigation gutters
and drug paraphernalia, all of which
was confiscated, the police said.
     "All that stuff," Sheehan said.
"It was absolutely incredible."
     The police, who had search
warrants when they entered the
Joneses' home, also were investigating
who broke into the home about 11 a.m.
Friday - an incident reported to
authorities by a 911 caller.
     The police found a rear door open
with a color television set and other
items stacked nearby.  The police also
found a message written in lipstick on
a second floor bathroom mirror,
apparently left by the burgular.
     "It said, 'Ha ha busted,'"
Sheehan said.  "It leaves you kind of
wondering, although the [breaking and
entering] appeared to be quite
legitimate.  The back door was open
*** jewelery boxes had been gone
through."
     Sheehan said the police would
have to wait for the Joneses to return
before learning what was taken
illegally from the home.
     "We know their pot plans aren't
there anymore," she said.  "We took
them.  That's against the law you
know."
 
 
     To better familiarize yourself
with the growing of marijuana indoors,
you will need a manual.  This article
does not carry you through the
harvesting stage and, besides, you may
have problems peculiar to your own
circumstances.  The best manual is Ed
Rosenthal's "Marijuana Grower's
Handbook, Revised-Indoor/Greenhouse
Edition", $19.95 + $4.00 for UPS.  if
you must have it sent to your P.O.
box, instead of by UPS, send $6.00 for
first class mail.  Their address is:
Quick Trading Co., P.O. Box 477, San
Francisco, CA 94101.  (MS - The
company may no longer exist.  I have
not researched it.)
     If you plan to sell marijuana and
even harder stuff to Russian occupiers
or Cuban invaders, you'll want the
full range of knowledge concerning the
dope field.  For all this you'll need
to subscribe to High Times, P.O. Box
410, Mt. Morris, IL 61054.  $29.95 for
12 issues.  (MS - Once again this
company may no longer be in exis
tence.)
 
           Growing Cabinet
 
     This growing cabinet is unique in
the way it is built and lighted.  The
construction is simply 2x4
construction with some 1x2's around
the top and 1x12's around the bottom.
It is enclosed on the sides, back and
top with large sheets of cardboard
salvaged from refrigerator cartons at
a local appliance store.  The lumber
was actually scraps picked up here and
there.  The main costs in the system
were the lights, timer and heating
pad.  Buying these items at a local
discount depa
