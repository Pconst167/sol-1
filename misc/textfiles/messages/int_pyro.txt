Just for the record...I've read a LOT of Kurt Saxon's stuff, and as far 
asI can tell, he's no white supremacist.  He comes from a real 
conservative  Far Right background, but he drifted away from them...got 
sick of their  kind of mindless parroting of whatever their leaders said 
was the party line. In Wheels oof Rage (a book about a motorcycle gang he 
used to hang around with) he really slams people like Willis Carto, and 
other  folks whose names you'd recognize if you'd been around Far Right 
politics as much as I have.  In The Survivor, he takes the pro-life 
position and just tears it to little pieces a lot better than most 
pro-choicers ever do.  The only group he's really down on is gay people.

I know of a guy, a tailor, that made a custom suit for a customer using 
flash tread.  While the customer was trying on the suit, the guy says, 
"Oh, look, a loose thread," pulls out his lighter and.... 
  Just found the recipe, thought I'd pass it along.

Flash thread--- flash paper..  now I see. Hmm okay well use saltpeter 
instead of Sodium Chlorate. that did seem a bit volitile. besides you can 
get saltpeter at the drug store easily. they sell it as a diruretic.

Flash thread? that like fuse? You can make fuse about the saem way. Except 
instead of just soaking try boiling the string in the mixture and 
evaporating the water off. The longer you boil it the slower the fuse. (I 
think). THis same stunt can also be done with paper.

To make flash thread (not the most pyromaniacal stuff, but...) mix equal 
parts potassium chlorate and sugar; soak & let dry.

Oh good someoen else heard of it to so I won't get yelled at. Hmm  accord 
to Fact Sheet 5 Kurt Saxon is having a sport of bother with his 
publisheres who (sport=spot) who was printing up extra copies of his books 
and selling them to other distributers. Anyone ever build tennis ball 
cannons?

Matthew: for ricin get a copy of the Weaponeer by Saxon. From what I hear 
Bush is a white supremist too. He belonged to the skull and cross bones at 
Priancton/Yale (where ever he went) and they have a whole room of 
Nazi/White supremacy stuff. I'll be Bush kills a lot more people than 
saxon does too :-)

Azoth-C, "common sense and some intelligence?"  I think you just excluded 
most of the people who are interested in getting ahold of the book.

if you have a working knowledge of chemistry and lab procedure and a good 
healthy dose of commen sense and some intelligence then you shouldn't have 
much trouble with the anarchist cookbook. just remember that there are 
better books of the same nature that are available. az .

I think I said this before, but:  The cookbook recipies all have a grain 
of truth in them, but are sabotaged.  Examine what they give you, and work 
out the equations, and you can usually get a good recipie after a few 
hours of work. 
  BTW, the cookbooks quoting of the aicd patent *is* complete and correct, 
according to several people who have used it.

It is widely rumored that the Anarchist's cookbook was written by the FBI, 
in an attempt to make as many one-armed yippes as possible.  I'd have to 
go along with that, as fully 90 percent of the instructions in the book 
are incorrect, dangerous, and/or unworkable.

   Jun 27, 1990 23:33 from Wirehead 
This has probably been said before but  maybe not. You should not use the 
Anarchists cook book for brewing up any  chemicals explosives or drugs. 
The directions are either wrong missing or insane. I believe there are a 
couple recepies that have you use equipment that the chemicals you use 
disolve. People have died and lost fingers and eyes following those  
directions so be warned.

C4 is made from motor oil and two other chemicals, hexametha-something and 
another one. it is not the kind of stuff you could readily synthesize in 
your shed or basement lab. and besides there are much more easier plastic 
explosivethat you could whip up. try vaseline and potassium chlorate. 
adding stuff like dextrin (binding agent) and gelatin gum (thickener) 
might help. by the way, the guy who wrote the article in Sci Amer also 
wrote an article on the same subject in Discover a few years back. the Si 
Amer one is much more in ormative though. he, John Conkling, is the only 
scientist in the US doing seriou s research on fireworks (at least since 
his first article).

C4 is a hard compound to make, so more often than not, it's recipie is 
left out of books.  anyway, Amatol will do anything that C4 will do, altho 
it's not as plastic.
