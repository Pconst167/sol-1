Since Loyds board is down, we needed some way to vote on new people, and
discuss new Tech. Journal articles, etc.
 
It is unavoidable that the sysop can access this sub, however I don't think
that will be a problem. If it is, just say so.

Current users with access are:
The Mentor
The Leftist
ANI Failure
Dan (who knows what handle he is using!)
The Urvile
Me
 
I didn't recall seeing a bbsuserlist so I need to know who else is on here
ie:
Prime Suspect
Doom Prophet
The Prophet
 
I would like to recommend Skinny Puppy for access/membership (more like
re-membership.)
Also since Bloodaxe had access to the lod sub on Phoenix, he should have access
on this sub. However it is up to you guys.
 
I have gotten in touch with The Blue Archer and he would like access to Black
Ice. And probably re-entry into LOH.
 
Since Thomas Covenant (pete) is out, we have 9 members. With 2 old members up
for re-entry.
 
Oh, one last thing, Even though The Marauder is not a current member (he has
been retired for a while now), he also has access to the sub.

Ok, The Prophet and Ferrod Sensor have access. The question is, is Prime
Suspect on the bbs?
 
The problem with this sub is half the users on the bbs have access to this sub.
Its kind of funny. Lets rename Black Ice to LOD II!
just kidding.

Nice to see a LOD/H board again! The addition of this sub makes black ice truly
complete in my opinion.
 
Frank - I need the LMOS machine names from SBDNDN if you have them..
 
Just for LODh eyes, Im going to u/l a few things here for us. See next posts.

The file 1aess/dialup/oms/rcs/etc. is just a misc. information capture I have
laying around. You can glean good info from it, for instance dialups to telco
computers are included in this upload, they are in a packed format like
1npanxxxxxxbaud where baud = 1200 in most cases. Try these out if you like, I
havent tried them all but most of them should be valid. And if you find a very
interesting system or something out of the ordinary, please let me know.
 
To find AT&T unix dialups in less than 5 minutes:
Call DA in a major city. Ask for AT&T headquarters or corporate building (get
both). This number will most likely be a type G (COSMOS) number, which is a
number like nxx-2000, 3000, 4000, something like that. AT&T uses centrex
setups, which means that the lines run from the lead number (which you got from
DA) up to a certain number, depending upon how many centrex lines they have.
Now, just manually scan the centrex group on other type G numbers (like
nxx-2010, 2020, etc.) and you will usually find a unix system. I found one in
St. Louis, and one in Atlanta, and one other major city I cant remember
offhand. It took less than 5 mins. in all cases. Also, if the HQ number is not
a type G number (it wont be something like nxx-5872 for the lead number unless
they are not using centrex), then try the corporate building.
 
To get dialups from SCCS: Run the unix shell (bin:sh!) from a developer
account, and then go into the /usr directory. Do a ls-a on all the directories
under /usr. You should see files named .remotecntl and .scanscntl. cat these
files and they will contain dialups (see the file I uploaded, it has several of
these in it). The scanscntl file is written to the users home directory when
they execute the call:scans! command from SCCH (scc shell). The number they
enter the first time they run this command will be written to this file. From
then on, every time that user types the call:scans! command, SCCSH will search
his home rdirectory for the .scanscntl file and dial the number in the file
andnd also use the baud rate listed after the number. The same thing is true of
the .rmotecntl files, except they are from the call:rmote! command. I have
scored several good systems like this (datakits, eadas, unixes, etc. and even
an lmos, esac minnicomputers, etc.) and also gotten lame things like tymnet
dialups.
 
SCANS is the software change admin. notification system. SCANS is used to
update the software on switching systems like 1,1A,2,2B,3,DMS-100, etc. etc.
SCANS has BWMs (broadcast warning messages) which are like batch files to be
applied to ESS offices through SCCS by ESAC personell. ESAC downloads the BWM
they need (to fix a bug or something) through SCCSs call: command, and then
they use send: to send the filename to the given office where it is applied.
 
Anyway, you cant use call: yourself unless you have VT100 type emulation (i
dont). Well, you can but it will be a mess.
 
You guys post some of the things you have found on systems and such. To my
knowledge, both items I have posted here are 'original' work, that is, I got
these methods on my own (whopee fuck) also please dont spread this to anyone.

Anyone have any PABX DISA lines? Will trade info for them. I want them to
engineer operators in those areas, not use alliance conf. services. Of course I
could social engineer a tops/tsps to complete a call to an inward, but I would
rather do that from a pbx instead of from a payphone.
 
If anyone ever nneeds an 800 number xlated just le me know and I'll see what I
can do...

guys feel there safe, ok, but I think the group is getting too big.There
allready is a informant or something on here, because one of the people I talk
too was talking about a private bbs that had something about att&govnermant on
it.. Look familer(SP?)  I like it just the way it is!  Why do we need more

I don't understand why Chris doesn't already have access here.  It's kind of
amusing to watch people who weren't even in the group when he helped start it
try to decide if he's fit to be back in...  I'm raising his level.
As far as SP goes, I'd say yes.  As for Archer, no, not yet.  This is not the
place to start breaking people who've been out of hacking for so long back in.

  Lloyd, talking about breaking people in.. What the fuck do all these old
guy's  YOU let in do?  I never see anything from them except alliances.  How do
you do blv?  what's COIN do?  Ever been in PREDICTOR.  I don't have a problem
w/ ERIC since he's your friend and all, but what the fuck.  Blue was in LOH,
LONG before you were.. This really sucks.. I'm sick of fighting with you about
stupid things.  Why do you want almost everyone that is around in the group?
That makes LOD just like any other group around.  It took me and you (rember
talking about this?) 4-5 years to get in LOD, now a few old people come back
and we have no right to not let them in?  Fuck that.. Ok,  I was in the CIA,
now I'm not, but hay.. I think I want to be in again.. I don't know shit about
it anymore because I haven't been in, in about 3 years..  But I was in so I
want back in now.. I don't think your in charge of putting people in.. I think
bad subscript shuld be in.  Lloyd dosn't like him, but I do, so I'm putting him
on the board.. YOUR NOT IN CHARGE!
and as to your fucking secure bbs. Someone on here is giving the info to
security people.. My friend was telling me about a bbs in 703 that has info
about ATT&the Government.. Dosn't sound like mr. secure bbs to me.

Ah yes, another oh-so-literate post from Mr. Dan.  Let's start with the most
ludicrous of claims, the so-called secure board problem.
 
A 'board in 703'.  Gee, could it be Atlantis?  Nah.  Could it be this one?
Maybe.  But everyone in the world seems to know that this board exists (since
some people can't keep their mouth shut), so it doesn't surprise me that some
of your 'friends' have heard about it...
But Danny boy, if I had to pick one person off here who I think is passing
buffers of this board around, his initials would be D.C. C'mon, never told Don
about this setup?  Never let him 'look around'  with your account?  Right.
 
Let's move along...  is this the same person I sat with at a swimming pool,
tripping, talking about how cool it was to be in LOD?  Remember talking about
how good everyone was that'd been involved in it?  Now all of a sudden no one's
'good enough' if they don't know a dozen LMOS masks.  Well I've got news for
you- Coin and PREDICTOR don't mean shit to me, either.  But you couldn't hack
your way out of a VAX or a PDP, much less into one.
 
Fuck you Mr. Michigan Bell Security Flunky.  I don't know who told you your
shit doesn't stink, but I can smell it from here...

Tell me Lloyd, why is it so important that 300 people have to be in the group?
We don't do shit!  The only people that do shit (That talk to other members) is
You (Lloyd, Chris(don't know him well but he's ok), Adam, Frank, Scott, me, and
Rob.  That's great!!  But why the others?  I'm not trying to fight with you..
Really!  I LIKE YOU!  But I don't let others use this account, and Don dosn't
look around, but someone on here is a fed!  I know I don't know what I'm
talking about.  I was told that "The private BBS in 703 has stuff about AT&T
and The Government.  That is THIS FUCKING BBS.  Lloyd, just think about what
I'm saying.  The less people the better.  I don't want any of us to get busted

number two:  this is so fucking lame.  looks like we've split into two groups

that he was phase jitter.  (well, you told andrew, which is reasonable enough,
but i thought we were going to keep this a secret)
the whole bits about phones vs all other machines:  who cares?  i personally
know both pretty well, but that's me being an egomaniac.  if you're good, then
you're good.  no two ways about it.  i say that we talk it over, nice and calm,
and see if we can iron our little differences out, eh?  granted, dan isn't much
of a hacker, per se, but he does 'know phones,' as lex put it.
as it stands now, am i the only person who is real friends with loyd & dan?  i
see noone else jumping up & saying "whoa, let's calm down here, eh".
number three:  i own sbdn.  noone should post anything about it unless you have
a vested interest in it.  i don't want to see ANYBODY with my lmos except me.
ME ME ME, mine, all mine.
number four:  there should be something we could agree on, shouldn't there?
i like to think we are all more or less reasonable people, so i'm sure we can
make some sort of compromise here, hm?
just a remark:  notice noone posted anything on here in weeks?  except things
"edited" so we couldn't harm ourselves, i guess.  that is insulting to me,
personally.
another colon thing:  i say bob should be in here.  i say no to archer, because
I DON'T KNOW HIM.  GUESS HOW LONG I'VE BEEN HACKING!  go on, guess.
no.  less than four years.  less than three, really.  guess i loozzzeeee, huh?

This group is a DEMOCRACY. I no longer want to or consider to have the power
to let anyone in the group. No one person has that power either.
I never dropped out of the group. LOD and LOH were separate entities, yet still
related. Dave (bill from rnoc) was put in charge of LOD (the phones side of
things) While I remained in control of LOH (Hacking). Then Dave ran into
trouble and we designated authority of LOD to ANI-F. Now LOD/H is a single
entity since it was too difficult to separate them and also since people have
interests in both phones and computers.
After Summercon last year when Leftist, Mentor, and ANI-F took it upon
themselves to admit Adam, Dan, and Prime  without even letting me know,
I decided that NOTHING gets done without a vote. Also, I wrote the History of
LOD/H file which everyone should have read (it was on Phoenix Project.) That is
somewhat of a bible. It stated that people listed as Inactive can be
re-admitted without any problem, however those who remained inactive too long,
ie: Fucked Agent 04 move into the out of lod/h category. Both Chris and Bob are
in that category. I didn't see nor hear of them or what they were up to for at
least 2 years. If everyone who was in the group is still considered in, then
we would have 30+ people in it. I was never informed that Chris wanted or
considered himself still in the group.
For that reason I decided to vote for access to this sub for him, and
re-addmittance to the group. However Loyd told me that he never knew he was
not in the group. I have listed in the file all those who are no longer in when
they left, for what reason, etc. If anyone wants back in they have to be voted
on again.
Both Blue Archer and The Marauder were in the INACTIVE category and can get
back in w/out any problems. Scott (B.A.) has been keeping slightly active and
concentrates on hacking in general not just hacking TOPS-20 systems. He is one
of the best hackers I have ever known.
 
Bob seems concerned about the arguing going on within the group. He, like I
feel we should settle things and move on.
 
So, I will update the History lof LOD/H file to add Chris, and everyone
voice their opinion on BoB. I believe both are in since there is little
opposition.
 
Marauder and Archer can get access to this sub but are not a considered
active members until we discuss them (Plus they may not want to become active
which is the Marauders case, he just wants to keep up to date, whereas Archer
seems to indicate that he wants to get back into things).
 
Dan, as far as 300 members is concerned or that the group is getting too
big, thats all immaterial. What is important is the the members are :
1) Trustworthy
2) Excel in their area of expertise
3) DO NOT RAG ON PEOPLE
 
#3: In the past LOD wes very respected because we helped people and didn't
rag on them (at least publiclly) about not being that knowledgeable, etc.
Wars between us and other groups never happened. What did happen was that other
groups decided they were at war with us, and we simply ignored them..
People who conduct themselves in a manner which degrades not only themselves
but the group as a whole will/should be voted upon for dismissal. I want to
hear EVERYONES opinion on this.
 
Internal group discussion/ragging may be inevitable at times but there is no
need to do it to people outside the group.
 
 
So Chris, read the lod/h file or I will update it and upload it here, then
re-read your Message to me and see how wrong it really is.
 
I am on everyones side, everyone has a valid point.
 
All business is accomplished thru voting. Majority vote rules. If someone
does not like it, they can resign.
 
Lex
 
PS. Dan, the reason it seems like we have 300 members is  because you have
285 different handles.

starts wars and fighting. FUck this! I thought we were supposed to be a group.
There are sub-groups within LOD/H of friends and such and war seems to come
easily.
 
Lex: the reason summercon was chosen as a regrouping of lod was because as far
as we all knew, you had retired, and no one could get hold of you anyway cause
no one had your number (that we knew of at the time anyway). maybe we jumped
the gun a bit, but it was in good faith.

I had a good reason for not giving my # to anyone back then. Now that I have
given it to LOD only, other non-lod people seem to have it. It makes me wonder
if anyone in lod has given it out. Although I suspect pulling tolls is partly
responsible. It bothers me especially when Taran King calls me and wants to
talk, but refuses to tell me who/where he got my # from.
 
Loyd: Your list is correct.
 
Erik: I will call you soon.
RE: Marauder. I believe he wants access to keep up to date but will remain
inactive.
 
RE: Empty Promise. Lets get a vote on him.
 
VOTING POLICY: No one HAS to vote. They may abstain for any reason. No one can
vote on soneome if they have never spoke to them (ie: e-mail or voice). They
must abstain. It is recommended that all current members speak to anyone up
for a vote. IE: EP. As most everyone has.
 
The main problem is #  security. Every one of us is concerned with giving out
our numbers. This becomes a problem when trying to add a new member as there
is no way to speak to the nominee so I was compelled to write my previous
message to clear things up and get on track.
 
On track is: The Legion Of Doom/Hackers Technical Journal Issue #4.
My Tymnet article is supposed to be in it, but I have to finish it. We need to
get previous TJ's online for other users.(Some have missed 2,3).

Of the 8 active people Loyd listed in msg #20 7 have voted. If Prophet doesn't
call in 1 week we will have to bypass him for voting. And then Tally.
 
Also Prime Suspect and Doom Prophet (I forgot his new handle) are heading for
the INACTIVE list fast. Active status is considered as putting in your 2 cents
on this sub. If they get on here then they can vote.
 
Voting should be deadlined no sooner than 1 week from today (Friday 4-14 ) and
no later than May 1.
 
Erik: We need new addresses after sufficient addresses have been obtained, we
will check all old ones. Be sure to omit anything sensitive from your results.
Anywone who wants to scan / update be sure to put all results in a file and

Loyd, lets all contribute to my vax/vms file.. if you have nothing else to do,
it would be appreciated, and would make the file better as well. Also, I have
collected a large number of DEC-related system dialups over the past few
months, including DECservers, VAXes, ULTRIX, and others. I have approx 75
dialups or so, and the list grows almost daily. I was thinking we could make an
internal file of this, or mayve just trade some back and forth, i.e. I give one
out, everyone else gives me one they have, etc. so all of our lists could get
bigger.
 
By the way, here is MICRO800/X.25 dialup: 800-345-4533. I have not messed with
it much. It seems as if any address takes you to the same destination, but this
is a conclusion based upon limited data , so the validity of this is
questionable. i'm not sure if we could enter x.25 addressed on it or not, have
not tried yet. For instance a dunsnet nua (31102111010606) for the PAD. Anyway,
if you guys get anywhere with it let me know, and as always, this is
intra-group only..
 
I believe I now have the ability to pull 800 translations from a DMS-100
switch. I have the procedure documented but still need to try it out. I plan on
xlating a large number of 800 numbers just for curiositys sake. So if anyone
has any 800s they need the PTN/xlation for, post of mail and i'll try it out.

be in touch with the bbs and everyone else. I  want to get sluggos article
and review it. We must get  Issue #4 out in 2 months. I will be in touch in
about 2 weeks (getting settled).

ISSUE FOUR IN 2 MONTHS, HUH?
 
THIS IS RIDICULOUS...NOONE CALLS, NOONE WRITES...THE ONLY PEOPLE I TALK TO ON A
REGULAR BASIS ARE DAN, BOB, AND LOYD...ADAM AND FRANK NOW AND AGAIN...SO JUST
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
ABOUT THE TJ:  SO, HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU THINGS TO ADD, WHAT
KIND OF REVISIONS, ETC... ON THE TELENET UPDATE...IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO
COMMUNICATE WITH US, THEN SOMEONE ELSE SHOULD REGULATE HOW THIS THING IS BEING
PUT OUT!!!!!!  I'VE BEEN DISTRIBUTING TJS 1-3 ON BBSES AROUND THE GLOBE,
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THE FUCK LOD ARE ANY MORE!!!
 
LOOK...I REALIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN COMMUNICATE,
BUT IF ANYTHING IS GOING TO GET DONE, SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE ACT AS A HUB TO
MEDIATE BETWEEN ALL MEMBERS...  I WILL GLADLY VOLUNTEER MY SERVICES, AS MY
GIRLFRIEND WENT BACK HOME FOR THE SUMMER AND I HAVE NOTHING TO DO HERE
EXCITING...ALSO, I NOW HAVE AN IBM AND 60 MEGS SO I HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE AND
COMPUTING POWER TO PUT TOGETHER THE FILES...ALSO, SINCE I HAVE PROBABLY PUT OUT
MORE TECH JOURNALS IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS THAN ANYONE ELSE HAS IN THE LAST 2
YEARS, I VOTE FOR ME AGAIN!
 
YOU NKOW, IF NOONE CAN GET YOU LEX, YOU SHOULD CALL US SO WE CAN GIVE YOU SHIT
IF YOU ARE GOING TO "TAKE CHARGE"  OTHERWISE, TRANSFER AUTHORITY TO OTHERS WHO
ARE MORE OBTAINABLE@!!!!!!!!
 
MAD AGAIN,
 
->ME
