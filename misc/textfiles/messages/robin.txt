                  **    The Tale  of Sir Robin.    **
 
 So, each of the knights went their separate ways.
 Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his
 favorite minstrels.
 
 Minstrel: song:
 
 Bravely bold Sir Robin
 Brought forth from Camelot.
 He was not afraid to die,
 Oh, brave Sir Robin!
 He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.
 Brave, brave, brave Sir Robin.
 
 He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp.
 Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken!
 To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away
 And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin.
 
 His head smashed in and his heart cut out,
 And his liver removed and his bowls unplugged,
 And his nostrils raked and his bottom burnt off,
 And his peni--
 
 Robin:  That's...That's, uh...  That's enough music for now, lads.  It looks
 like there's getting work afoot.
 
 Three headed knight: HALT!!!
 
YES!!  It was the dreaded Three Headed Knight, the fiercest creature for
*yards* around! For second....  after second..., Robin held his own, but
the onslaught proved too much for the brave knight. Scarcely was his
armor damp, when Robin suddenly, dramatically, changed his tactics!
 
 Minstrel:                                       Robin:
 
 Brave Sir Robin ran away.                       No!
 Bravely ran away away....                       I didn't!
 
 When Danger reared its ugly head,
 He bravely turned his tail and fled             No!!
 Yes brave Sir Robin turned about                I didn't!
 And gallantly chickened out..
 
 Bravely taking to his feet                      Never!
 He beat a very brave retreat
 Bravest of the brave,                           Lies!
 Sir Robin.
 
 He is sneaking away, and buggering off,         No I didn't!
 and chickening out, and running off home,
 Yes, bravely is he lacking of spine.            All lies!
 
 Voice over:  Meanwhile, King Arthur and Bedevere, not more than a swallow's
              flight away, had discovered something.
