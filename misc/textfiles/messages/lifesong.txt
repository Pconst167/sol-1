AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT...

IITT'SS...

aLWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE

Some thing in life are bad
They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear
and curse
When you're chewing on
life's gristle
Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out
for the best...
And...
(Music slides into song)

...always look on the bright side
of life...
(Whistle)

Always look on the light side
of life...
(Whistle)

If life seems jolly rotten
There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and
dance and sing
When you're feeling in the dumps
Don't be silly chumps
Just purse you lips and whistle
- that's the thing.
And...always look on the bright
side of life...
(Whistle)

Come on.
(Others start to join in)

Always look on the bright side
of life...
(Whistle)

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain
with a bow
Forget about your sin - give the
audience a grin
Enjoy it - it's your last chance
anyhow.
So always look on the bright side
of death
Just before you draw your
terminal breath
Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke,
it's true
You'll se it's all a show
Keep'em laughing as you go
Just remember that the last laugh
is on you
And always look on the bright side
of life...
(Whistle)

Always look on the right side
of life...
(Whistle)

Come on guys, cheer up.

Always look on the bright side
of life...
Always look on the bright side
of life...

Worse things happen at sea, you
know.

Always look on the bright side
of life...

I mean - what have you got to lose?
You know, you come from nothing
- you're going back as nothing.
What have you lost?  Nothing!

Always look on the bright side
of life...
(Fade...)
