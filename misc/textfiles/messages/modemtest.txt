Jason,

I love the work you are doing at textfiles.com.

I was the SysOp of "The Art of War BBS" in Atlanta, Georgia from 1991 until
late 1994.  (Yes, I am included in your list for the 404 area code!)

I would like to donate a collection of messages from my bbs that would fit
nicely with your collection.  Let me set it up for you, so the messages make
sense.  These messages come from a period of time when I was "fed up" with the
BBS scene and decided to take down "The Art of War BBS"(TAoW BBS).  However, I
had a job in the computer field repairing computers and I often called my own
bbs as a "modem test" while working on defective modems.  So, while I was fed
up with TAoW BBS -- I still wanted to keep some sort of system "up" so I could
test modems.  Voila -- "The Modem Test BBS" was born -- the name itself kind
of being a joke... I didn't think anyone would actually call when they saw
TAoW BBS was gone.  Boy, was I suprised!  The messages were so lively and the
support from my callers so great -- that it actually inspired me to put TAoW
BBS back online!  I kept these messages all these years... and I gladly
contribute them now to textfiles.com.  Enjoy.

Regards,
Charles "Chuck" Hood
former SysOp of The Art of War BBS
Atlanta, GA

What the Hell is going on here? I remember seeing this "Art of War Jr
" here before. Then, the real thing was up; tried calling and calling to
see if Chucky had answered my mail, then this AGAIN. Well, this AOWJr.
will go away just as it did before, then reapear (strange how that
happens).

Chuck. Chuck!! Chuck!!!!!
 
Always dismayed to see a promising bbs go down, but understand totally 
how time constraints and MONEY play heavy parts in your decision.  I hop
everyone will learn from this and dig deep for the next FREE board that 
comes along.  There aren't many left.  And Ya'll (thats right, Ya'll) go
to admit that for all the info and entertainment, you can't beat the 
price.  So, in closing, I would beseech you all to take what you have 
learned here today and support your local sysops.
 
All this from a guy who never donated a red cent, but next time, I'll do
things differently.
 
Chuck, good luck in your future endeavors.  As someone said before, Hope
to see ya on the boards.
And to all the rest of the users!   Take care.

Well ya know I've often considered running for political office my self,
and if i were ever elected king i would force contentment on the entire 
world, ya know like free orgies for everyone thrice daily. Seriously 
though I think our political sys needs a complete overhaul you cant tell
the difference between the canidates anymore. History shows that times 
like these need a dictitorial force to upset the balance a little. 
whereis king nixon when ya need him? I dont want to make lite of the 
vietnam thing, but it had its place in history, it woke people up,just 
like the civil war and jfk assination. yeah i know we are in this 
recession thing, but if your middle class employed or better it doesnt 
really affect you, you dont go to bed at night worrying how you can 
conquer the next day, you just do it and life gows on in a boring
chain. you dont care about that sleeping giant country out there waiting
to capitalize on the situation, you just dont think about and then its 
pearl harbor all over again and we are in a world of doo-doo.

I worked on modem problems all day on Friday.  I worked on three

This is getting to be unacceptable.  
 
There needs to be an ANSI standard on modem commands.  The "de facto" 
Hayes standard is a joke.  Everyone supports the basic "AT" commands, bu
all the extended commands that handle compression, flow control, and 
error correction are all completely different from manufacturer to 
manufacturer.  This sucks, no joke.

i think taxes should be increased to help reduce the deficets
if you mak over $15000 you shoud pay at least 45 % in federal taxes
if you make over $30000 you should pay 75 %   in federal taxes
if you make over $100000 you should pay 90 % in federal taxes
this would assure the government has enough money to run on.
i don't see how anybody could disagree with this.
these tax rates only make sence for america
nothing is more american than paying your fair share of taxes.

YOU PEOPLE ARE INSANE!  but I like it.  Jo Bob, I bow to your imaginatio

meat person.  LOVE ME! ME! ME! ME! ME!  ahem.  Does anybody remember the
old softdrink pathetic attempts to give away money by having a can say
"You Win!"?  I heard the only winner was a man who spent 14 days in the
desert with no food, water, or attractive frogs to "fokk" with.  He foun
the machine in the middle of the desert and put in his only 50 cents.  H
screamed &amp;#%^&amp;*&gt;""}%&amp;*P:$?&amp;&gt;# and died right then.  The can was never 
found.  I hear God has a new plan for us.  He made a God-woman (you know
how women want so muchpower) and decided that each and every one of us 
will make organic condoms for his erotic deity-like love-life style 
thingy.  Oh, well....  LOVE ME! ME! ME! ME! I thinkyou great people leav
great messages and at my great place of work, I will greatly hunt down 
the great person who talked greatly of my great use of the great word 
"great"     great. The great rumors of my great death have greatly been

One good way to tell if a new employee is going to be a poor employee is
to follow him to lunch.  If he eats at Cleves multiple times and still

 Is the Art of War BBS down, or is it permanently gone? I am looking for
some boards dedicated to modem play. Any suggestions would be 
appreciated. Thanks!

Looking For...  Ballistics data on fifty cal desert eagle.  Need to 
ascertain components for commercial loads.  If anyone has any 
noncatastrophic hand load data for that weapon it would also be greatly 
appreciated.  Would also appreciate any info concerning lead fouling of 
the gas return port.  Would like approximate number of rounds fired 
through which model eagle (Caliber is important here) and what ammo was 
used.  Could also use data in lug wear of the roller bolt.  50 data is 
probably scarce but any info would be appreciated.  Any subjective data 
concerning the weapon used in tactical situations would also be nice.  
Thank you for any pertinant info.

There is NO NEW NUMBER for The Art of War BBS.  It is down.
 
It might come back again someday but not until I can get some decent 
equipment to run it on.  My current computer system is 386SX 16mhz with 
40 meg hard drive and is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE for today's computing need
 
I just don't have the money or time to run the Art of War they way it 
deserves to be run.  My most humble apologies to all former AoW users.

Barney is a child molester. (The guy in the suit;not the voice) He was 
arrested a little while back for child molestation, but never sentenced 
and let out on bail. I think if they are going to have a DINOSAUR show, 
it should be violent,(Dinos eating kids, etc.) T.V. today doesn't have 
enough funny violence and death. I think the show should be more graphic
and explicit in nature. Any comments?

Is this message about floride a joke?  It didn't say "No Joke" so I

I do not drink tap water, nor do I use it for cooking.  I use only 
Crystal Springs bottled water at my house for drinking and cooking.  No 
Joke.  I buy Crystal Springs water 4 five gallon jugs at a time and I 
have my own water cooler dispenser at my house.
 
Again, this is not a joke.
 
I do still use tap water for bathing, but I am very careful not to drink
any while I am in the shower.  
 
Is floride harmful if it gets into any other bodily orifices while 
bathing?  I would really like to know this!!

The Desert Eagle Fifty was outlawed for use in desert storm because of 
the KNOWN ballistics.  While serving in the US Army I was specifically 
instructed NOT to use the fifty cal machine gun on infantry.  I am sure 
that the ballistics are similar enough to arrive at the same conclusion.
DON'T even mention the barrett rifle.  All available ammo was used up in

velocity and temperature is concerned, please use the kelvin and parsecs
per femtosecond scales.  we would not want to unfairly represent you on 
the cosmic scale of flatulance.  I will patiently wait for you to poke 
your anus/crainum out from under your lilly pad/handle and give me more 
ballistics data.  i want to make sure you deserve this representation

BECAUSE i am not an average joe and i called this board up and noticed 
that before it went DOWN that it had several files that might have had 
that information.  i never got to download anything because the next tim
i called aow was down and i thought that the board would have some 
members who could be of help.  NOT some frogg hopping lilly livered bozo
who understands ballistics only as a beer fart.  IF you are not s. frogg
do not worry about the last line. BESIDES, I think that aow would have 
been a good start on finding that information.  You are probably entirel
correct in your statement that the info or a knowledgable person would b
on aowjr.  knowledgable refers to ballistically, not intellectually.

Chuck, you're kind of late with the verifying process. I like it beign 
done right away. So I had to call a friend of mine and he verified me 
instead. It took away the discomfort instantly. very nice gyu - he had 
done this for me before.
As far as passwords go, I've never had a bad one. The foremost authority
on passwords is in Belgium. He has words lists in eleven languages (I 
downloaded them all, of course). At that time, my password was the plura
form of the word "sheep" in the Bulgarian language. SInce there is no 
online dictionary for Bulgarian, I'm safe for now. Later on I'll switch 
to Sanskrit - it has eigth tenses, four ods, singular, dual and plural 
forms and 10 conjugations. As you see, I like to keep things safe.

I think he means the anal orifice. It is an established fact that 
flouride in that area causes itching, burning sensation, emotional 
tensions and overall discomfort in general. This problem is best treated
using the Black Olive method as follows:
Select a ripe, black olive (the Krinos brand from kroegers works well) 
and split it in half. Place one of the halfs in your mouth and gently 
sqeeze for about 20 sec. Then remove it from your mouth and place it in 
the orifice. Again, sqeeze gently - this time for 15 sec. only. Repeate 
this no more then four times a day. A few treatments should be enough to
git rid of the burning and itching sensations. 
This is one reason why I always keep a few black olives handy.

Boy are you ever going to look stupid.  I have a FEDERAL FIREARMS 
IMPORTERS LICENSE from the FEDERAL BUREAU OF ALCOHOL (methyl), TOBACCO 
(wacky) and FIREARMS (fifty cal DE).  Anybody in the business knows 
exactly what I am talking about.  BY THE WAY the fifty DE can be had in 
several finishes and barrel lengths for about $1300 street.  Owning an 
arsenal is not illegal, just how you use it.  It took two long years to 
clear a MP-5 through customs.  It is also virtually impossible for me or
anyone to resell a firearm like the MP-5 to some irresponsible jerk 
because the FBI knows my inventory and you can bet that if any jerk uses
a weapon similar to say an MP-5 that they will immediately pay me a visi
and I better have possession of the weapon and probably some fired slugs
for rifling matching.  BESIDES, I can only sell the weapon to someone 
else with a license and the paperwork is HELL.

To be brutally honest chuck, if you looked at what was left, I bet that 
no one could figure out if it was a fifty or a thirty.  My instinct has 
always been that if I was in the tank and some joker jumped up close 
enough to pick up visually on the fifty gunsight that I would with great
calm and finesse inform the crew that avon was calling.  Translated&gt;&gt;&gt; 
XXXX (deleted expletive) HAND LAUNCHER AT 300 DEGREES.  What that means 
is that the driver will immediately go to heading 270 degrees or so and 
zigzag while maintaining frontal armor to avon.  Presumtion that no 
terrain cover is available.  The tank commander will immediatley unload 
that illegal according to the geneva convention fifty until even the san
fleas will need a microscope to find bits.  The gunner of course will hi
MAIN on his console and launch a M833 105mm sabot round (he was expectin
another tank) to "nail" the sucker and eliminate said sand fleas.  Then 
after the driver runs over the hole in the sand everyone goes looking fo
new underwear.  DESPITE the fact that NO current hand launched anti tank
weapon can penetrate the frontal blazer reactive chobham armor.

Check with your desert storm buddy chuck.  everything i wrote is on the

smoothbore on the A2 and they would not let him take the governor off th
turbine.  For all you trivia buffs the M1 has a 1500hp gas turbine with 
hydrostatic tranny.  in other words, you don't wait for the revs to hit 
the powerband. you immediately have 1500hp on tap off the line.  the M1 
(all 62 tons) can out accelerate most cars from 0 to 30.  if you take th
governor off the M1 it will do 70mph on hardtop.  for any doubters, dig 
out Jane's and check.  Talk to your buddy chuck.  he will tell you that 
this aint no joke.  By the way "blazer" is the semiofficial name for the

Generally the write precompensation factor is factory set and that info 
is not usefull without the head acceleration slew rate based on random 
seek tests (track to track if you want to be picky).  Spidle hub wear is
nonexistant since the spindle lies on the bearing surface and not the 
hub.  I would like to see you hold your breath on that 1000 write/read 
number on a READ ONLY optical disk.  Before you ask for a SPRING load 
insertion resistance you better make sure it is not a voice coil HD.  I 
only want to save you embarrassment.  If you want a knee graph of the 
amperage to voltage ratio just insert one generic diode.  If you put it 
in backwards I am sure you will get all the amperage you can handle.  
Also the spring loaded ejection force is NOT relevant in a voice coil HD
because they unload from a capacitor discharge.  The sea/level millibar 
ratio wont help you much in this case because your expertise is obviousl
with ancient 5mb/500ms hard drives.  AND by the way join the real world 
and shorten that 1000/1 interleave ratio.  P.S. your so welcome.

I made the presumption the thing was already started.  With all gas 
turbines you have to electrically bring up the rpm to get enough 
compression to fire it up.  I am not familiar with the tach idle button 
per se but most turbines measure rpm off the starter/generator and it 
probably isnt a good idea to read how may amps the starter is using and 
the voltage that is usually tapped to read rpms.  Most turboshaft engine
generally run up and maintain rpm's and adjust the turbine stator blade 
angle to increase torque to the output shaft.  The "pedal" generally 
increases stator angle and fuel flow together.  You don't just gas a 
turbine and get power by increasing rpm.  The tach idle button probably 
will allow more current to the starter motor in those nice situations 
where the driver shut down the motor and a few iraqi tanks roll over the
hill.  Spooling up rpm takes time and in combat you might not have it.  
THIS info is not certain.  Your buddy probably has a much better idea.

on page 20 or so is this nice drill.  Hey you.  Yea the wimp who wants t
buy this toy.  Get a real gun son.  Buy this "necked down" army surplus 
M110 mobile artillery piece.  208mm ammo extra of course...  The fun par

Have some ballistics anyway!!! you deserve it!!!  Let me try to explain 
this to you (start at 1st grade) why do you want the algorithm (firmware
when you are looking for the driver ASSEMBLY (hardware).  Also WHY do yo
want the DECODER algorithm if you are ENCRYPTING the matrix info.  You d
not need matrix info unless you are looking at more that one pixel.  (a 
one by one matrix does not count).  Your problem with HUD flicker is 
based on your silly attempt to refresh the pixels instead of the frame 
buffer.  THIS is a good place to use matrix algorithms.  Well I suppose 
you could use the matrix driver system to transmit via a nonvga RJ-11 
device (would not "phone connector" been easier to type?) but I think yo
are going to have a BIG attenuation problem trying to refresh ANYTHING 
with a -9dbm level.  I presume with your silly pixel refresh that you ar
going to need terahertz capability over a phone line?????  I like you, 
you are very funny.  HEY CHUCK YA NEED A REAL MODEM TEST. I GOT A 
VOLUNTEER.  Hey pvt kelly you better study ballistics for this lemon...
Its your only hope...

appealing was "Deep Thought", starring Ernest P. Worrell as Ernest P. 
Worrell, and Vern starring as his beautiful sexual partner. The intro 
leads us to a quaint farm scene in Minnesota...
ERNEST : "Hey, Vern, this barn is really relaxing, and the hay looks
          comfy."
VERN   : "Okay, okay Ernest! Quit pestering me! We'll have sex here!
ERNEST : "Huh? Wha...? Okay, sure!"
(The screen wavers and finally blacks out and fades into the following
scene...)
ERNEST : "Ooooooooohhhhhhh yeah! YEEEEHAAAAWWWW! Wow Vern! You feel 
          SOOOOOO GOOD, YAKNOWOTIMEAN!!!?????"

After reading all the delightful posts I missed while I was away I have 
several comments. 
1. Why would anyone want a pistol in .50 calibre. Why not just get a 
106mm recoiless rifle, add some Pachmyre grips and carry it in a shoulde
holster.
2. "Return to the Valley of the Ernest's"
3. Barney is a government plot set out to enslave the minds of our 
children.
4. We were so poor, our ham was sliced so thin it only had one side. The
soles of our shoes were so thin I could stand on bubblegum and tell you 
what flavor it was. At Christmas, we decorated a stump.
5.It's beter to copulate, than never.

It's kind of funky that he mentions antwerp as the diamond capital of th
world.  It is as a trading spot for worldwide dealers.  To the best of m
knowledge most diamonds come from south africa and russia.  if BOTH of 
the bozo's had done their homework they would buy the raw material at 
"rock bottom" prices and process the stones themselves which would save 
whole bunch of money.  It always helps to cut out several expensive 
middlemen.  It would not look good to say I am now is south africa or

air speed velocity is two kiloparsecs per second and the takeoff vector 
is within an arcsecond or so of the crab nebula.  If you swallow any 
unladen things you have failed your ballistics test and no useful data i

stuck rocks so that the resulting ballistics do not nick said port.  We 
recommend ballistically applied glycerin suppositories in case you need

We were so poor that when the first Marsian invaded, we had nothing to 
give him but baked shit with potatoes and corn cob in the butt. Now were
are evemore poor. We ran out of the shit with potatoes, but we got plent
of corn cobs left.
When are these Marsians exactly comi anyway. I want to be ready with the
corn cobs.
P.S. Using vulgarities indicates lack of vacabulary. Don't blow it. Try

P.S.S. I have nothing against Marsians. I'm an equal opportunity corn co

You can sue him if you want to. He can be facing up to 6 months in jail

Or we can do something on our own. This phone number is the real thing.
Or he might be smart enough to call back and appologize. We'll see.

Thank you, I think of my self as being very cleaver. Ward Cleaver as a 
matter of fact! I went away when the old AoW died it's horrible death an
I called the other day to see if maybe it had been ressurected. I was 
saddened by the fact that it wasn't, but I laughed my ass off at some of
the messages I read. So, I decided to join the fun! And boy I'm glad I 
did! I'll post again soon!

Randall,
The Recoiless Rifle was INDEED manufactured in 106mm calibre. From about
1940 on. If you doubt my information, check any edition on Jane's Infant
Weapons from 1945 to the present. I think you may be getting the 106mm R
confused with a 105 Howitzer. Believe me, the 106 exists, I almost had m
eardrums ruptured by one while I was stationed in Korea!
 
BTW, do you work in Marietta. And did you recently attend a suprise B'da
party at a chinese resturant? If you are the same RH, I still owe you a 
modem!
Reg
P.S. You must name the resturant to claim your prize!

we were so poor we could not afford any

through the barrels of out 50 cal. desert eagles and our
106mm recoiless rifles, so we went next door and borrowed 
a cup of ballistics data from our neighbor, no joke!!!!!!!

Dear Scott,
I am confused and bewildered. I'm astonished! I'm outraged! How is it 
possible for anybody who had seen THIS board to ask for numbers of other
boards??
Let me tell you something about the situation on hand. We are a closely 
knit society of top notch professionals dedicated to modem testing and 
ballistic data gathering. We are on the cutting edge of a variety of 
subjects, such as black olives and bodily orifices, Earnest, squirrels i
atics, the philosophical meaning and the ontological significance of 
being poor - just to mention a few. We have succesfully dealt with 
Idiots, Marsians and other earthly and cosmic assholes (as opposed to 
black holes, since a black hole can be thought of as the asshole of the 
Universe, which is a more general term). We are pioneers in many areas 
and this here board is the birthplace of trends and behaviors taking 
place throughout the modern world, as we know it. But if you still insis
on obtaining some phone numbers, read my next message (titled Numbers).

Dear Scott,
The records of this board inicate that our members have been interested 
in two phone numbers only.
One of them is 1-800-EAT-SHIT.It has been said that this number will 
provide you to an access to the old ArtOfWar (only on a Sunday, on a ful
moon, as I understand it).
The other number quoted is 1-800-GoGoHoJo which should put you in touch 
(please, be mindful of what you touch) with the famous radio personality
and the foremost ballistic data analyzer, Jo Boobs.
Both of this sources should provide you with plenty of entertainment. Bu
if you're in a need of spiritual healing (as your question indicates) yo
might call Aion "Spiritual Healing and Metaphysical Board" on 640-9670. 
Accidentally, they have a list ABBsomething of all the Atlanta boards.
And please, don't forget to check your modem. Anybody who finishes with 
"your computing pal" needs a check of some kind.
Thank you again, and don't be a stranger. Call us soon!!

We were so poor we couldn't afford BALLET data, much less ballistics dat
and we had no TV to watch since we lived INSIDE the barrel of a .50 
calibre DE. There just wasn't any room for a TV. So, we used to go over 
to our neighbors who were a little better off and lived in a 106mm RR 
barrel and had more room. And we had to EAT what the beaver left. And if
we were VERY good and VERY lucky, we MAYBE got a thimble full of 
ballistics data at Christmas. But that was not very often. Jo Noke!

Vince,
I have NO idea what you are talking about.
However, if I DID know what you were talking about, I would have to say
that neither of the aforementioned .gifs is adequate.
Now if you had a picture of a proctologist doing a firechicken, we might
be able to do business.
 
BTW, I went to my proctologist last Monday for my anal annual. After 
getting ready and bending me over he inserted TWO fingers. When I asked 
him why he had used TWO fingers, he said he just wanted a second opinion
HAHAHAHAHAHA...get it...TWO fingers...SECOND opinion....oh fukit!
 
I still can't stop these voices in my head,
And Barney the Dinosaur keeps telling me to murder all the people on my

Enchilada Ballistics Eh!  My database has reference material on that one
You are one lucky person.  The energy dissipated in cracking the bowl 
probably reduced projectile energy enough to prevent a richoccet and a 
severe posterior injury.  Fortunately the cylinder was a softnose 
projectile that did not ignite the flatulance upon impact with the bowl.
That was tried once as a prop and danny glover blew his commode right ou
of his house!!!  The softnose round probably inflicted a lot of shrapnel
damage when it disintegrated upon impact.  I have designed a wildcat 
round using scotch bonnets in the enchiladas.  The navy tested it as a 1
inch tracer round aboard the USS Ward Cleaver.  The mess officer has not
cleared its usage due to insufficient amounts of ice cream on board.  
Please contact weapons officer aboard the USS Ward Cleaver for all 
pertinant ballistics data.  DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.  THE ORDINANCE 
OFFICER WILL NOT REPLACE BURNT OUT BARRELS.
