26  MIKEY, first of all, you were correct,I was speaking ONLY of women
27 who have been RAPED. Many men have also been RAPED..not only homosexuals but
28 a surprising number of heterosexuals as well.
29 Now to your definition // By the ORS,163.305. the felony of Rape is 
30 decided by many factors.  The most common condition is that of which you 
31 spoke concerning permission.
32 The terminology in the Oregon Revised Statue is "Forcible Compulsion." I 
33 will refrain from the entire definition unless you request it.
34 Our work as I indicated earlier, is to assist women in deterring Rape in 
35 many fashions.  There has been a successin the Portland area in this 
36 endeavor.

56 NO, PIONEER, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW AUTOPILOTS WORK.  IT IS TRUE THAT FOR 
57 LANDING THE PLANES RESPOND TO EXTERNAL SIGNALS, BUT THE 747 AND MANY MODERN PLANES HAVE INERTIAL GUIDANCE SYSTEMS THAT ARE
58 INDEPENDANT OF EXTERNALS.  OVER A 2000 MILE FLIGHT, THESE THINGS ARE ACCURATE TO LESS THAN 1 MILE.
59 	OF COURSE, AS YOU SAID, IF THE WRONG COORDINATES WERE LOCKED INTO THE SYSTEM, THE PLANE WOULD (NATURALLY) GO ASTRAY.
60 	AS FAR AS I KNOW, THE 747 HAS THE ORDINARY COMPLEMENT OF 3 IN THE COCKPIT: PILOT, COPILOT, AND NAVIGATOR.
61 INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE 747 HAS LESS NEED FOR CREW THAN SMALLER, OLDER PLANES.  IN FACT, I AM TOLD THAT THE 727 CAN TAKE 
62 OFF, FLY, AND LAND WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION.  (I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS, HOWEVER)

64 WELL NOW!
65     ONE REASON BRIGHT PEOPLE GET SUCH BIG EGO'S IS THAT DUE TO THE DISTRIBUTION
66 OF THESE PEOPLE MOST OF THEM DON'T RUN ACROSS EACH OTHER VERY OFTEN UNTILL
67 THEY ARE OLDER, WHEN THEY MIGHT JOIN A CHESS CLUB, WORK FOR A HIGH TECH COM-
68 PANY, GET RICH, OR WHATEVER. AT THAT POINT THEY BEGIN A PROCESS OF LEARNING
69 GOOD MANNERS AND SOCIAL SKILLS THAT OTHER PEOPLE GO THROUGH MUCH EARLIER.
70     THIS CONTRIBUTES TO THE 'NERD EFFECT' THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO SIGN
71 COMMITMENT PAPERS FOR PEOPLE LIKE THE UNSIGNED BOOB WHO HAS BEEN HAUNTING
72 THIS SYSTEM OF LATE. IF 'UNSIGNED' IS STILL YOUNG ENOUGH, WHICH I SUSPECT HE
73 IS, RESOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM WILL COME WITH TIME, HOPEFULLY. EVEN
74 HARDENED CRIMINALS MELLOW OUT UNLESS THEY MAKE IT TO THE TOP, MOST OF THE
75 TIME. INSTINCT TELLS ME THAT 'UNSIGNED' ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE TOP
76 IN THE NEAR FUTURE. PEOPLE WHO AUTOMATICALLY REJECT OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS
77 USUALLY DON'T.
78     GETTING OUT AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION MAY PARADOXICALLY
79 NOT BE NOTICED AT FIRST BY AN INIVIDUAL LIKE THIS, BECAUSE AUTOMATIC REJEC-
80 TION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS MAY HAVE SET IN. SO USED TO SMOWING EVERYONE
81 IN SIGHT WITH FAST-TALKING B.S, OUR 'GENIUS' MAKES A FOOL OF HIM/HER SELF

83     DEAR MIKEY- IBM HAS JUST CHANGED SOME OF THEIR SOFTWARE TO SET RESULTS
84 EQUAL TO ZERO ON A DIVIDE BY ZERO INSTEAD OF ISSUING AN ERROR. I AGREE THAT
85 THIS IS USEFUL. AGREEING THAT PARRALLEL LINES CONVERGE IS USEFUL IN PHOTO-
86 GRAPHY TOO. MATHEMATICAL RESEARCHERS HAVE MADE MUCH PROGRESS OVER THE 
87 YEARS BY CONCENTRATING ON SUCH CONUNDRUMS, CREATING SYSTEMS WHERE THE
88 NON-COMMONSENSICAL IS TRUE. IMAGINARY NUMBERS HAD THE STATUS OF A JOKE
89 TO NON-CREATIVE TYPE MATHEMATICIANS AT ONE POINT TOO.
90     DEAR UNSIGNED - LOOK IT UP IN YOUR CRC, DUMMY - IT'S A TRIVIAL PROBLEM
91 (THAT'S THE CHEM RUBBER BOOK,YOU KNOW?). OH, BY THE WAY, LIMITS AND REAL
92 NUMBER CONCEPTS DON'T REQUIRE CALCULUS - CONSULT YOUR ARCHIMEDES.

104 Batpoop: A thousand thanks.  I was starting to feel rather lonely.
105 
106 To defend myself for the last time:  I did not bring up black holes.  My
107 response to the first inquiry was to refer queries to an article of Scientific
108 American.  The only thing I claim as my own is the set of unreal numbers.
109 
110 PAM: 747's use a triple set of inertial guidance devices.  These are 
111 supposedly unaffected <sp?> by radio frequency interference.  So I don't
112 think that would be a factor.
113 
114 I have a few questions of my own:
115 
116 1. Was 007's actual flight path shorter than the one they were supposed to be
117    on?
118 2. It is not that uncommon, however very against company rules and results in
119    termination if discovered, for pilots to sleep while on long oversea 
120    flights.  Could one or more of the pilots been asleep?
121 3. Does anybody know the procedure used for flying that route?  Especially,
122    when flying by (or over?) Japan, do they switch to VOR navigation?  If so,
123    then the RFI theory may need to be looked into.
124 
125 BYE                                                                THE DOCTOR

147 	Well, Batpoop, you've done it again.  Unfortunately, your assumptions about me are only true if you are correct that
148 I am wrong in my information.  If I am correct and you are wrong, then the tables are turned.
149 	I do not 'automatically reject' other people's ideas.  I only reject those ideas which are wrong, illogical, 
150 internally inconsistent, or incredible.  In fact, I also recognize that people often have the right ideas but very wrong
151 reasons.
152 	A most enjoyable activity of mine is to be able to discuss (intelligently) a scientific subject with a person
153 (or persons) who are sufficiently qualified to express original thought.  I spent a few years at a place where people were 
154 selected for their interest in science and technology, and I found that to be close to heaven on earth:  At last, I was
155 among my peers.  Perhaps not surprising, each person was able to contribute to practically any discussion that went
156 on, even if it was not their primary field.  
157 	I remember no conversation where anyone overstepped his qualifications, and no-one tried to impress the others with 
158 his knowledge, since each was comfortable with his own position.  We could all accept the fact that the EE was better
159 able to convolve a time-domain signal, the biologist was best in designing a DNA synthesis reaction, the CS was more
160 experienced in explaining a program dealing in artificial intelligence, the mathematician was better integrating a 
161 trancendental function, and the organic chemist knew better than anyone how to analyze a binary mixture.
162 	Each knew, however, that he was outclassed by each of the others in their respective fields; More importantly, he
163 knew that each knew enough about the other fields to be able to detect bullshit and doubletalk.  You couldn't even
164 begin to pull the wool over their eyes, and you didn't try.
165 	But now, in the REAL WORLD, experts are few and far between.  A person can recite  parrotted material and pass himself off 
166 as, if not an expert, a cognoscenti in a particular area.  He can express poorly grounded opinions secure in the knowledge
167 that nobody around knows enough about the particular  field to be able to detectit.  And if anyone does come around that
168 points this out, he can use personal attacks to restore his position of respectability in the group.   Since no
169 commonly-respected expert will likely come around to expose him, that person  is generally safe from embarrassment.
170 	I will not present myself as an expert in any particular field, though I probably qualify in a few.  That's because
171 I have found that the more one learns on any subject, the more one recognizes how little he really knows about the rest
172 of the world.  The more I learn, the less I feel I know.
173 	But please return the favor and tone down your technical discussions.  While you may prefer playing with your
174 toroidal black holes and such, you might as well be talking about magic.  If you really want to even the score, we
175 could have a heated discussion on one of the following topics:
176 	1.	1983 Fashion on Alpha Centauri.
177 	2.	The sex life of electrons, protons, and neutrons.
178 	3.	The world 25 minutes BEFORE the big bang.
179 	4.	Interstellar golf tournaments
180 
181 	I freely admit knowing absolutely nothing about the preceeding topics, and I'm sure you will too.  This means
182 that we're equally qualified to discuss them, so we can debate them till the cows come home without fear of being proven
183 wrong.

223 Signed:  Well put!  It is sometimes entertaining to watch people make
224 fools of themselves, but it does get tiresome.  I am totally in favor of
225 the freedom of expression afforded on BWMS but the bullshit does get a littl
226 thick sometimes.  Perhaps as these persons become more aware that their
227 comments are recognized for what they are, they will tend to stick to subj-
228 jects in which they are more knowledgeable.  I have found that the key to
229 successful bullshitting is infrequency.  When exercised with extreme caution
230 and only in the event of an emergency (such as when you get pulled over forr
231 a traffic violation), it is often successful, but when it becomes a
232 routine, the listener (reader) will generally catch on eventually re-
233 gardless of his/her knowledge of the subject.

239    The above is an opinion of an unqualified individual.  I do not
240 read newspapers (its depressing), my TV is broken, and I didn't realize 
241 Lebanon was on the map  (unless, of course, you were speaking of Lebanon
242 Oregon).
243 
244 Mikey, a better way of dealing with division by zero in basic is through
245 error control; in other words, the ability to transfer to a particular
246 line in the event of an error, rather than printing an error message.  I
247 have found this capability very useful but I am not sure what other PC's
248 support this other than TI.

257 Division by zero: in calculus we went to great lengths to define it, usually
258 as "undefined", and the 0/0 was pointed out as ambiguous and could be
259 anything: this is how the proofs that 1=2 work.
260 As to flight 7; the people who knew what happened are dead, I suspect we will
261 never know why, don't let this stop us from imagining reasons.
262 In Lebanon the people who have a hereditary right to the land are being\
263 pushed out and oppressed. Of course this has happened about 1000 times, so
264 some 1000 different groups have hereditary rights tot the land. blow it off

271 think a general description of the terminology is important.
272 
273 PROTON--He is the "head" of the atomhold and is most often found
274 sitting around the atom looking at perverted electron magazines.
275 
276 ELECTRON--She is typically running around the atom seeing to the needs
277 of the proton (except one).  Although she often complains of a head ache,
278 such is not always the case, as is evidenced by the neutrinos which
279 are constantly running in and out of the atom.
280 
281 NEUTRINO--Analogous to bambino.
282 
283 NEUTRON--He is not quite as picky as to the company he keeps, but he
284 preferth to hang around with the boyth.   In the event that he can't find
285 any "boyth" to hang around with, he will often just go off by himself

312 Signed: My sources for MY comments about black holes range from
313 Scientific American to several books on the subject (by PHDs). I
314 DON'T claim to understand all of the math, but I DO know that 
315 such things as toroidal black holes ARE possible according to
316 many of the theories (mostly the theories that allow "naked"
317 singularities). Besides, if Hawking's work on the quantum physics
318 of black holes is correct, ANYTHING can happen! I realize that
319 you won't take MY word for it, so why don't you check out Hawking's
320 "The Breakdown of Physics in the Region of Space-Time Singularities".
321 In this he says (regarding quantum decay of black holes) "they
322 emit all possible configurations with equal probability." Think
323 THAT over for awhile! The apparent cosequences of this are probably
324 quite distressing to people with rigid thought patterns.
325 ___________________________Leonard_________________________

369 spectable bacteria are being forced out by these "wee beasties" who first
370 take over, then begin to cultivate viruses and establish navel academies

392 WELL NOW!
393     BY SHEER AND UTTER COINCIDENCE, ONE OF THE ENGINEERS FOR THE GUIDANCE
394 SYSTEM ON THAT 747 WAS AT MY HOUSE THE OTHER NIGHT. ACCORDING TO HIM, IT'S
395 A GARBAGE IN GARBAGE OUT SYSTEM. ACCORDING TO A PILOT ON CABLE TV SATURDAY,
396 AMERICAN PILOTS CHECK THE NUMBERS PUNCHED IN 5 TIMES, BUT HE DIDN'T THINK
397 "THIRD WORLD" PILOTS DID THAT AND ALSO ALLUDED TO THE DICTATORIAL CAPTAIN
398 THEORY TO EXPLAIN WHY SUCH A MISTAKE COULD OCCUR. ACCORDING TO THIS GUY,
399 PLANES OVER THE PACIFIC ARE TYPICALLY OUT OF RADIO CONTACT FOR HOURS AND
400 COMPLETELY DEPEND ON THE ONBOARD NAVIGATION SYSTEM AT NIGHT WITH REGULARITY.
401     AS I UNDERSTAND IT, MOST OF THE NUCLEAR STUFF THE USSR CAN HIT US WITH
402 IS ON THEIR EAST COAST(WONDER HOW MANY MINUTES AFTER LAUNCH WE HAVE HERE 
403 IN PORTLAND. LATELY IN WEAPONS CIRCLES A VERY HOT TOPIC HAS BEEN EMF( EMP?)
404 WHICH IS THE IDEA THAT A SINGLE NUCLEAR EXPLOSION COULD DESTROY ALL 
405 ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT WITHIN A RADIUS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES, THUS ELIMINATING
406 ANY DETERRENT THREAT IF ONE OR TWO BOMBS ARE SNEAKED INTO POSITION AND SET
407 OFF. BOTH SIDES ARE PRETTY PARANOID ABOUT THIS, THE RUSSIANS MORE SO THAN
408 OURSELVES. THIS PROBABLY HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR ACTIONS IN THIS
409 MATTER.
410    TO PAM - WISH WE COULD GET BACK TO AFFECT AND EFFECT INSTEAD OF USING
411 VARIATIONS ON "IMPACTED ON, IMPACT OF,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT", ETC. THOSE
412 PHRASES REALLY MAKE ME GRIND MY MOLARS.
413    TO (UN)SIGNED - 1) YOUR DISCUSSION OF YOUR OWN DEBATING TACTICS IS PRETTY
414 ACCURATE IN THOSE SECTIONS THAT ARE LUCID IN YOUR LAST STATEMENT.
415                    2) ARE YOU SAYING THAT ONLY SPECIALISTS ARE QUALIFIED TO
416 DISCUSS A PARTICULAR FIELD? IF SO, SINCE YOU HAVE (I THINK) ADMITTED THAT
417 YOU ARE NOT A SPECIALIST THEN WHY DON'T YOU TELL US YOUR SPECIALTY SO
418 WE WILL KNOW WHEN TO LISTEN TO YOU. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU MEANT TO
419 SAY THAT YOU ARE 'PROBABLY' AN EXPERT IN SEVERAL SCIENCES, (WHEN DID YOU
420 WIN YOUR NOBEL PRIZE!?) HOW MANY PHD'S DO YOU HAVE. IF YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
421 DEGREES AS QUALIFYING ONE FOR DISCUSSING A PARTICULAR SUBJECT (AS WELL YOU
422 MIGHT NOT), WHY DON'T YOU DISCUSS WITH US YOUR STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING
423 JUST WHEN SOMEONE IS A REAL EXPERT IN A FIELD AND TELL US HOW THESE
424 STANDARDS QUALIFY YOU AND NOT THE REST OF US (EXCEPT AARON-HO HO). ON
425 THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU ONLY MEANT THAT YOU ARE SMARTER THAN THE REST OF
426 US AND QUALIFIED TO SIT IN JUDGEMENT ON US, WHY DON'T YOU LIST SOME OF
427 YOUR MORE MONUMENTAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR US SO WE CAN BE PROPERLY IN AWE
428 OF YOU. YOUR LAST CONTRIBUTION WAS QUITE AMBIGUOUS ON THIS POINT. I CAN
429 WELL UNDERSTAND AFTER THE PERFORMANCE YOU JUST TURNED IN THAT YOU WOULD
430 LIKE TO DISCUSS THINGS THAT YOU'RE SURE NOBODY CAN CALL YOU ON.
431                    3) THE ATTEMPT TO TURN THE TABLES AND SUDDENLY BECOME
432 THE VOICE OF REASON HERE WAS A GOOD THOUGHT - WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT AGAIN
433 WHEN YOU LEARN WHAT THE VOICE OF REASON SOUNDS LIKE. I'M AFRAID YOU HAVE
434 FAILED MISERABLY THIS TIME - YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE BROUGHT UP "INTERNAL
435 CONTRADICTIONS" IN A NOTE SO FULL OF THEM.
436                    4) I AM AMAZED THAT YOU CONTINUE TO REMARK ABOUT
437 PEOPLES QUALIFICATIONS WITHOUT SUBSTANTIATION. HAVE YOU CHECKED THEIR QUALI-
438 FICATIONS? HAVE THEY CHECKED YOURS? WOULD THEY CARE EITHER WAY. LETS GET IT
439 ALL OUT IN THE OPEN. FIRST WE COULD DISCUSS WHETHER A PERSON SHOULD ONLY DISC
440 US THAT FIELD HE IS EXPERT IN. MAYBE WE COULD RESOLVE TO CUT OUT THE 
441 TONGUES OF EVERYONE WITHOUT PHD'S. SECOND, MAKE THOSE PEOPLE WITH PHD'S 
442 ONLY TALK TO OTHER PHD'S IN THE SAME FIELD, OTHERWISE SOMEONE WOULD BE
443 OUT OF THEIR FIELD. THEN LET'S CUT OUT THE TONGUES OF THE STUDENTS WHO
444 HAVEN'T YET GOTTEN THEIR PHD'S, LEST THEY QUESTION THEIR PROFESSORS TOO
445 SORELY. 
446                    5) YOU SEEM TO BE ALLEDGING THAT MANY OF THE TECHNICAL
447 STATEMENTS I HAVE MADE ARE NOT FACTUAL OR WORTHWHILE - LETS GET 
448 SPECIFIC. I THINK I CAN BEAR IT IF I TURN OUT TO BE WRONG ON SOMETHING.
449 SO LETS HEAR WHICH POINTS YOU WANT TO DISPUTE.
450                    6) YOU ALMOST OPENED UP WITH 'THERE YOU GO AGAIN'!
451 DID YOU FILCH MY BRIEFING BOOK? AND HOW COME IF YOU DID YOU'RE STILL
452 LOSING THE DEBATE? HAR HAR HAR HAR.

524 electronics teacher?)  The fact is that the source is generally $5.75
525 per hour at night, $7.75/hr evenings, and $20.75 during prime time.  I am
526 a Source user (at night) and find it well worth $5.75.  These prices may
527 have increased slightly recently, but certainly not to $100 .  I understand
528 Compuserve is even cheaper at night but more expensive during the day.
529 STC is great for practical and informational purposes (no I don't work
530 for them) but nothing can compare to BWMS for entertainment.

535 DOM: suggest you be more carfull in reading. Batpoop was speaking of the
536 $100/hr on dialog not compuserve et al.
537 It seems to have been a VERY busy day here. To those who responded to my
538 comment about division by zero, please note that I was not indicating 
539 if using a answer of zero was right or wrong by the current definition
540 that the mathmaticians have given it, rather I was speaking of a much
541 more important issue. What is the most practical and useful answer for
542 day to day use. Most notibly math within computer programs. Should we
543 require a bomb out error, or is it more practical to just return a value
544 of zero? This as I say is not to be based on what the current definition
545 has been given the condition, but what is most useful in real live use.
546 To: unsigned: While those who are 'qualified' in a particular area do
547 indeed tend to know far more about what they have defined that area to
548 be, I would like to point out that a rather significant number of major
549 advances are made by people who are not considered 'qualified' by the
550 'insiders' of a particular area. This is because they have not become
551 totally caught up in their work that they refuse to explore outlaying
552 areas because it is obviously worthless to consider. If you would like
553 an example, consider Tesla (the father of AC electricity) he was told 
554 a multitude of times that his ideas were all wet that DC was the only 
555 proper way to send electricity. One of these people was Thomas Edison.
556 But he was able to sufficiently prove his idea to Westinghouse that
557 He decided to take a chance. Need I say what the results were? I see no
558 point in discarding someones idea just because it is not the accepted
559 answer, who's to say the accepted answer is correct?

567 Mike: somewhere I saw a better answer to division by zero. I think it was
568 on a honeywell, but i could be wrong. It returned the largest possible
569 number, which was also available under the name of 'infinity'. Another
570 possiblity is to test for /0 and jump to an error routine, but you have
571 to provide this routine. Returning 0 is not good, usually, because other
572 valid inputs do this, and /0 is seldom a valid procedure. If 0 is returned,
573 a prior test is still needed, to protect you from getting a 'valid' result
574 with garbage input. As I remember, the IBM PC gave a for a/0, and they
575 admitted it is a bug.(early version of IBM basic)
576 For further thought on strange but useful results read the current Dr. Dobbs
577 issue on Forth, an article on integer division noted the unusual results
578 from dividing a negative number by a positive (or vice versa), and how 
579 this is unsymmetrical with the more common +/+ case. The 1983 'standard'
580 forth recommends the so called bottom function, in which the result is
581 always the next smaller or next most negative integer, and the remainder
582 is always a positive fnumber. -5/3 = -2, remainder 1 (rather than =-1, 
583 remainder= -2) This question arises because integer division is not really
584 an intuitive process, and differs from normal arithmatic which is continuous

593 Batpoop:  Pardon if I have misread your message, I will try again later
594 (when I'm awake).
595 
596 BAD:  Very good explanation of div by zero problem on PC's.  I failed to 
597 mention that returning maxint or minint is also appropriate (and
598 practical).  I'm still curious, though; which PC's on the market
599 support error control (besides TI).  Doesn't IBM?  I still prefer this
600 approach where possible because if
601 0/0 gives an intermediate result,
602 (of maxint) then further calculations may, in some cases, bring the final
603 result into a range that it cannot be distinguished from data which is not
604 the result of an overflow.  
605 ACCIDENT: "0/0" above should have been "anything/0"
606 Error control also has other applications.  Suppose, for example,
607 that for one reason or another memory oerflows during the execution of a
608 program; I believe the typical response of a PC is to issue a nasty little
609 error message, and in most cases halt program execution.  With ec active,
610 though, it is possible to transfer to your own subroutine which "performs"
611 garbage collection or stores some of the data on disk or whatever to make
612 more memory space available, then returns to the main program to con-
613 tinue execution.

618 TO: Et al         RE:x/0
619     Actually I would be most happy if people who write the high level
620 langauges would give a little more thought to error conditions when
621 they write stuff so that I don't have to.(I could have sworn that that
622 was the purpose of a high level langauge to remove the burden of that
623 sort of hassle off the programmer!) But in exchange for not properly
624 handling the errors, I would be quite happy to just have the value 
625 returned as something useful instead of falling into shuddering fits
626 when it happens. I suggested the return zero value as I found that 
627 this seemed to be what I wanted as an answer 99.9% of the time. I am
628 fully aware of the mathmatically incorect implications of this, but I
629 don't consider the current method to be any more valid. *** CISTOP MIKEY ***
