33 Milchar : My apologies for not getting in touch with you before ride time and leaving you in the relative boredom of
34 Estacada. So you liked the SAT's? Did you take my advice about the pillow? If we would have thought about it before, I
35 could have set you up with some SAT prep software (public domain of course). Hope you did well enough to get you into
36 the school of your choice. I am sure you will do fine.
37 Mikey : Like I said, they certainly aren't Zork reincarnated, but as BASIC adventures go, they have generally more 
38 rooms, more commands, and are faster then many I have seen/played. I don't know if you have ever played a Scott Adams
39 adventure, but the format of the screen are based on his series (He wrote or co-wrote 12 adventures which were very
40 popular in the pre-Zork adventure world.

80 Leonard: you asked about the signals to the monitor.  Well, according to
81 my M1 schematic, 5 is ground, 1 is +5, and 4 is the signal.  Numbering is:
82                      3         1
83         (front view)   5     4
84                           2
85 Pins 2 & 3 are not connected.
86 Hope you managed to drag yourself out of bed in time for work today.
87 In either case, you have that hard-fought (3 1/2 hour) Trivial Pursuit victory
88 as consolation.  Of course, employing the Kingston Trio as your secret psycho-
89 logical weapon is against all Geneva conventions, but all's fair....
90 && TMA &&: you make a formidable adversary and a good partner.  Thanks.
91 L'homme: I finally got to see the TP playing that you have advertised but
92 never delivered.  While the cards were with you, you blew us away.
93 And, of course, the lack of `distractions' also helped, I'm sure.  To bad
94 the cards and dice froze on you the second half.  C'est le vie.
95 Marty:  notice how, when they were trying to decide partners for the second
96 game, you and I were lumped together by default?  I guess it was a result
97 of not being outstanding on either end of the scale.  Oh well.
98 You didn't seem to be suffering from the cats nearly as bad as at Gage's.
99 Fortunately.
100 Milchar: I hear you've been helping R-H Corp out with their plumbing problems.
101 Perhaps on one of their representative's trips out to your part of the sticks,
102 he could bring along a copy of the Nuclear Option?  I've discovered that all
103 I have left on disk is the word processor version (lots of printer commands
104 embedded.  Does not make for coherent reading.)  If the R-H rep can't help,
105 I suppose I could mail a printout to you.  Of course, I'd need your address for
106 that.
107 	Well, this is the longest entry I've made on BW in some time, so
108 I guess it's time to get back to homework and such.

122 	THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED " GOOD IT IS GOOD TO SEE THAT YOU CAN
123 BE HUMBLE, YOU HAVE MUCH WORK AHEAD OF YOU. YOU WILL BE SENT ALONG WITH
124 ONTHO to a school where your new talents will be developed. Your heart
125 is good and at the end of your training you will know the reason we have
126 given you this power."
127 	Leo was having a hard time taking this as seriously as she should
128 of. (actually Leo is a bit of a flake, but quite lovable and honest...)
129 "When does the training start?" Inquired the slightlu amused and curious
130 young woman.
131 	"it has started already." the voice came not from the old woman
132 but from a young duke of a man who had stood up and moved to the edge of
133 the disk peering down at Leo, who was quite taken aback by the attractivness
134 of this male. The disk moved closer and was hovering about waist high.
135 	At this time Ontho took the opportunity to hop up onto the disk.
136 Attention was lavished on the little inmo instantly. "ZZZSSSRR KAW PZZZ"
137 Ontho had fooooound a friend with the old woman. She was very inviting
138 with a full bag of venus bards to devour. * venus bard are of course from
139 the planet Venus and are not unlike our common garnersnake, the bards
140 have a protective shell like a crab, and are a favorite treat of Ontho.

142 Voyeur: Thanks for the info! Yes, I *DID* make it to work on time (thanks to
143 a cab [$$$]). I even survived the day (I think).
144 Mikey: I have a couple of questions about the source. 
145 1. at SETUP you changed the code to MVI A,02FH;OUT DSK4;*???? 1771
146    the ???? represents a comment I can't decipher (looks like "KilL"!?)
147 2. you changed SIGNON to BWMS. There are penciled notes referring to 1800H
148    and 1800-1BFF. Unfortunately the source has a "gap" from 17B1 to 2000.
149    (by the way, is PAUS a pseudo-op for the Diskwriter "assembler"?)
150 #1 will probably explain itself when I get far enough into the code. But I
151 *AM* curious about the several hundred missing bytes. (You didn't buy any
152 parts from former Nixon aides, did you?)

161  
162      At long last the jet has slowly lifted from the runway and begun its
163 climb through the oppressive heat and humidity of this southern city.  I've
164 ordered a glass of wine, and when it arrives I tilt my chair back and begin
165 to relax just a bit.  I've been here much too long, fought too many fights
166 I only partly believe in, and I feel so tired.  Though I am dressed in my
167 best business suit I fear that I must look as weary as I feel since the
168 flight attendants have been overly attentive, especially considering that
169 this flight is booked solid and they are working at maximum speed to
170 accomodate us all.
171  
172      My wine arrives, and I down it quickly.  I hope to sleep soundly now
173 despite the noise and turmoil of the crowded L-1011 around me.  As I tilt
174 my chair back to its maximum, the pilot comes on with an announcement:
175  
176      "Due to some apparent vibration in one of our engines I am sorry to
177 say that we will be forced to return to our point of departure.  We hope to
178 have the problem corrected shortly, and should be able to resume our flight
179 after only a short delay.  We apologize for any inconvenience this...."
180 Though the announcement continues, I pay it no more attention.  It is
181 beginning to seem that I will never get back to my home, never see my
182 friends!  For the last four days there has always been something to
183 interfere with my return home.  I sigh and consign myself to my fate, and
184 order another glass of wine.
185  
186      On the ground the minutes turn to one hour, then two as the ground
187 crew tests to see if the problem is repairable.  The crowded plane has
188 slowly thinned out as harried businessmen and others have left to attempt
189 to find other connecting flights or accomodations for the night.  I have
190 kept myself occupied with a book, an airline dinner, and a constantly
191 refilled glass.  The announcement finally comes that repairs cannot be made
192 tonight and that everyone is invited to leave the plane and either stay
193 here in local hotels at the airline's expense or make connecting flights
194 through travel agents they have graciously supplied.  The plane begins to
195 empty, and the grumbling and growling of the dissatisfied passengers sounds
196 more animalistic than human to my now wine-dulled senses.  I remain seated,
197 and eventually find myself the only remaining passenger aboard.
198  
199      "Excuse me, ma'am," the smiling and perfectly color coordinated flight
200 attendant says to me, "but I'm afraid that you're going to have to get off
201 now.  We have to make major repairs here, but we have representatives of
202 the airline available for you in the terminal..."
203  
204      "No," I respond gayly, "I think I'll just stay here."
205  
206      Her professional demeanor cracks only slightly at the edges, and her
207 smile looks forced.  "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand.  You have
208 to get off now."
209  
210      I can see that she is worried that I am going to be difficult, and she
211 has been helpful, considerate, and very friendly throughout the aborted
212 flight, so I change my tactics a bit.  "I'm not trying to make your job
213 harder, I just don't want to leave this comfortable seat and nicely
214 air-conditioned environment to return to that sweaty, humid terminal where
215 the air conditioning is broken and the temperature is moving from extremely
216 distressing to outright rediculous."  Glancing out the window, I sigh
217 lightly and comment, "It's awful out there.  Thirsty weather as my
218 grandmother would have said."
219  
220      She smiles again, still the professional, and rapidly walks to the
221 back of the cabin.  Shortly she returns, and in one hand she holds a large
222 plastic bag with the airlines name emblazoned across the side.  "This
223 should help to make things a little easier".  Opening the bag I find
224 approximately twenty little bottles of wine of various brands.  I see
225 Chablis, rose, and champaigne, as well as one or two ports, some cordials,
226 and a Bordeaux!  I certainly cannot drink all of this, but some of it will
227 make this boring night a little easier.
228  
229      "Thank you very much!  Uh, I hate to drink out of the bottle...", and
230 shortly I have another bag filled with little plastic airline "glasses".
231  
232      I merely wanted to express my displeasure with one more delay, I
233 think, but at least I have something to show for it this time.  As I leave
234 the plane, the flight attendant ("Hi! My name is Tawny!") also exits behind
235 me and walks toward the terminal.  I stop so that she can catch up with me
236 and say "It looks like you're stuck here for the night too.  Would you care
237 to join me in a nightcap?"
238  
239      She looks wary, and responds hesitantly.  "Um, uh, I really shouldn't,
240 I've got a lot to do..."
241  
242      "Don't worry, I obviously won't attempt to seduce you like most of the
243 passengers who make this offer.  Besides," I grin, holding up the bag of
244 plastic glasses, "I hate to drink alone!"
245  
246      A real smile this time, one that includes her eyes as well as her
247 mouth.  "Why not?  That's the best, and safest, offer I've had all month!"
248 I can see some of the tenseness leave her, and her manner becomes less the
249 professional and more the friend.  A victory, and least in part!

308 the term 'Board Patrol' but never thought much about it.
309 With all of the new BBS systems cropping up on the VIC-20s,
310 and other inexpensive computers, it seems that an environment for abuse

335 	The young duke held out his hand to help Leo aboard the disk.
336 She took his hand and the next thing she knew the were headed out of
337 the void. The atmosphere was light and she felt her head spinning. "It
338 is sure a good thing they have such comfortable flight seats." She thought
339 to herself. Suddenly another thought entered her mind that was not her own,
340 It was the thoughts of the young duke, he was agreeing with her. "my god!"
341 "what is going on, why can I hear you thoughts?"
342 	We find it much easier to communicate this way, certain feelings
343 can never be expressed properly by words." Leo had to agree with that.
344 "how much longer before we reach our destination?" she said outloud as if
345 she was afraid she would never hear a human voice again... The
346 young duke replied" Just sit back and relax, see Ontho is."  It was true
347 after scarfing down the bard, Ontho was quite content, just sitting in
348 a little inmo sized flight chair purring. "kazzzaa kazzzaa ahzz"
349 	"I guess if Ontho feels safe... come to think of it this has

354 When I started reading the entry some distance above, I began experiencing increasing
355 pleasure.  Who was writing this excellent prose?  Something from the long-quiet
356 Grand DragonMaster?  Gaudy Minsky?  Their entries were sometimes that good.
357 It didn't really *feel* like piper, maybe it's some newcomer?  
358 Writers of THIS quality are Always welcome.  And then the end came, 
359 and there appeared that old familiar, all-too-seldom-seen border, with the
360 famous signature.  All you out there who wonder at the continual reference to PAM,
361 and having your work held up in comparison to that of PAM, can now see what
362 it is you are being compared with.  As you can see, she has not been exaggerated.
363 (gosh, I'm starting to sound like Mikey, aren't I?  Well, I guess I
364 just had a PAM fix when I needed one).
365 If I haven't made myself clear, PAM, I'm pleased to see your latest offering.
366 I hope this is indicative of things to come?

369 OH COME ON PEOPLE. GIVE ME A BREAK! YOU MAKE THIS PAM
370 OUT TO BE SOME KIND OF GODDESS OR SOMETHING. SHEESH.
371 WHY DON'T YOU GO CRAWL BACK IN YOU HOLE WHERE YOU CAME FROM.

374 The Innkeeper returned home from a long and tiring day.
375 Odd he thought, I feel a presence I have not felt in a long 
376 time. What could it be? Opening the door to the Inn, the 
377 presence became a wisper as if from a long distance away.
378 PAM? Is that you? Where are you? Hmmm, I must be hearing things.
379 It's been too long. Months? It seems like years. I'm just too
380 tired, next thing you know I'll start seeing things. 
381 Opening the door to the humble room I kept for my self in the 
382 back, I flop down onto my cot to tired to even remove my cloths, 
383 and fall fast asleep, with pleasent dreams drifting thru my head.

387    Hmm ... looks like one of our local sicos has returned.  The above just does
388 not feel like **kathy**.  I've noticed that when someone writes something for
389 even a short time, you feel a kinship with them that lets you know when they
390 are really there.

392    The piper felt like a chip whirled away in a raging flood.  Milchar bore on
393 ahead, as one posessed.   His drive to complete the neclace was nearly visible.
394   Oblivious to the whispers and quiet comments of the rest of the party, he
395 had his heart and eyes fixed firmly at the point in time when he would complete
396 the neclace he wore.  With incredible energy, he negotiated transportation for
397 them in this watery world, moved them to what seemed to be an outpost of some
398 sort of civilization, then just as abruptly moved them away.  Shifting slightly
399 on the back of his steed, the piper thought of his companion the pegasus with
400 love an longing.  How he yearned for the caress of those giant wings, the surge
401 of power that would carry them aloft to play tag in the wisps of clouds near
402 the ground.  #No disrespect, my freind#, he thought as he patted the neck of
403 his mount.  #But, you are not the one for whom I yearn.#
404   The piper nearly fell off his perch when the beast replied.
405   #Yea, sure.  Same to you, Mac.  Are youse guys about done running all over
406 the landscape?  I gotta talk to a guy about a deal and this is cutting into
407 my social life, too!#

410 Piper: Which Kathy entry do you refer to? I didn't see any that were
411 uncharacteristic. 
412 Leonard: Yes, it did say 'Kill the 1771' I'll tell you about it
413 when I have more time. (The missing bytes? I think my secretary
414 ate them...)
415 PAM: It's good to see you back. Does this mean you will be sticking 
416 around for a while? (Now if we can just get these people off the
417 floor and stop genuflecting...) I will be waiting patiently to hear
418 the next episode you have to tell. I am sure it will be interesting
419 as always.

422 Monday the Oregonian ran an article about the Child Abuse 
423 Conference put on by the State Childrens Services Division and 
424 the Benton County Sheriffs Department.
425     The keynote speaker characterized the sexually abused as 
426 "the walking wounded whose experiences as children have left 
427 a very devistating effect on their lives". He then goes on to 
428 say that HALF of all children will be abused by the time they
429 are eighteen.
430     Let's take a look at that. Do you really believe that half
431 of everyone younger than eighteen, down to and including 
432 infants, have been sexually abused? Would you characterize 
433 fifty percent of young people you know as being the "walking
434 wounded" of child abuse? 
435     The only way they could come up with a figure as high as 
436 fifty percent is by including teenage sexuality as a form of 
437 abuse. The article even mentions the problem of minors having 
438 sexual experiences with other minors. Gasp...how awful.
439     Am I the only one that finds it somewhat frightening that 
440 the "experts" consider teenage love making a form of abuse. I'd
441 love to hear your opinions. I know you must have missed me.

456        It died a deserved death when we all realized that sometimes, when MY COUNTRY is wrong, it must be changed, or it
457 will be lost.  Still my country.  But too often the above statement was used to justify evil and then insinuate that
458 those who pointed to the evil where somehow "UnAmerican" and traitors.  So it died.

463 We were off again!  I wish we could stop and eat now and again.  Lila was 
464 struggling to keep up, obviously she had never before ridden an icthyosaur.
465 But then, who among us was really proficient at it.  And these seemed to be
466 sentient creatures.  "You bet your boots were sentient," a voice bellowed out.
467 Taken aback, I said "Excuse me, I did not think you could read minds too.  My
468 name is Friar Mossback, what is yours ?"  "Arthur Fromsbergen, thank you, but
469 you may call me Artie."  
470 "Well Artie, I would like you to meet Lila, and I am sure that you know her
471 companion, although I do not."  
472 "Her companion is named Guiniverre Fromsbergen, and is my mate."
473 "I am very pleased to make your aquaintance." I replied.  "As am I." said Lila.
474 "She prefers to be called Gwen, and she is very shy."  I could see that Lila's
475 mount was turning a most beautiful shade of lavender.  "Is she blushing ?"
476 "Yes", said Artie, "Our 'blood' is purple"
477 "I have heard" said Lila, "That lady icthyosaurs have the most beautiful voices,
478 do you suppose that you might sing us a song, Gwen ?"
479 Gwen turned almost the color of midnight, but nodded her head ever so slightly.

485 Mikey - In regards to your activity tommorrow, I comend you for holding your ground.  While I do find major 
486         differences in the two major candidates, I feel that your vote for None of the Above is a legitimate 
487         statement.  If it is just throwing away your vote, then voting for anyone other than the winner is 
488         throwing away your vote.  I do not see a vote for a losing candidate as throwing away a vote, no 
489         matter how much he/she loses by.
490         Keep the faith, in whatever method you choose to express your views.
491 
492 All - You do have a moral obligation to vote, even if you do not think that either of the choices is good.  Vote for
493       None of the Above, Libertarian, Jack Reynolds if you wish, but vote.

548   If anyone really cares, I apologize for my prolonged absence. But I find it harder and harder to stay alert about Backwater.
549   Assorted messages, as always, follow;
550   MILCHAR; Forget all that I said about Black Magic, I don't feel the same wqy about him after all the above.
551   MAN IN GRAY; It seems that I would need some transformers for the 'EQUIPMENT' we discussed. I do have a Z-80 free for you.
552   And the inevitale message, the one I know you have all been waiting to hear, the one for Pam;
553   PAM; I never did allow myself to read any of your writing with more than a fleeting glance, and I regret it immensely.
554   I suppose that's all I really did have to say, and having done, and seen so much, I say good bye to you all.
