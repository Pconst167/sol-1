 25 	Emu looked into what was to be used as a classroom.  Simply
 26 labeled, a sign said 'Conf D' above the opening to the room.  This was
 27 where Emu was to start his apprenticeship, along with other new
 28 recruits.  Late.
 29 	He didn't mean to be late, but it really couldn't have been
 30 helped.  Emu's horse hadn't been cared for properly before his
 31 departure.  After cleaning up the oats spilled by his nervous hands,
 32 he had to saddle and bridle the beast.  Those of the equine nature can
 33 smell nerves a furlong away, and this one had been absolutely no help.
 34 In the stables at the Hallowed Farm, Emu gladly turned the reins over
 35 to the stable boy.
 36 	Now, Emu is not normally a nervous person.  He had gone
 37 through the preliminary hearings and interviews with a strong will and
 38 a quick mind, but now that he was accepted, he *had* to measure up to
 39 expectations.  Looking 'quality' for an hour long interview is one
 40 thing: being 'quality' for the rest of one's life is quite another.
 41 Nonetheless, here he was, about to step into the rest of his life.
 42 	This first meeting turned out to be a very fast and
 43 overwhelming overview of the philosophies and practices of those who
 44 would learn The Cube.  Themes were explained and expounded upon, and
 45 the "Theme Angels" were introduced: "Mr. Quality", "Mr. Clean", and
 46 especially "Mr. Punctual". (Emu grimaced on the last.)
 47 	Then came the formalities: promisories, signatures, and the
 48 final will and testament (just in case).  Emu and the others were
 49 reeling when lunch was finally served.
 50  
 51 	After lunch, Emu joined those who were learning the
 52 fundamentals of The Cube.  Here, he met several other apprentices. 
 53 These students had come from such far away places as Tejas, City of
 54 Lost Angels, and City of Late Saints (also known as Utah).  Together,
 55 they delved into some of the simpler secrets of The Cube.
 56  
 57 				.-.-.-.
 58  
 59 	"Teacher?"
 60 	"Yes Emu, my son?"
 61 	"What is the meaning of my title, 'Apprentice, d0'?"
 62 	"That, my son, gives designation of your progress.  You are as
 63 a point: as it gains depth, it gains dimension."
 64  	"As a beginner, then, I have no dimension."
 65 	"That is true."
 66 	"As I gain enlightenment, I will gain dimension."
 67 	"True again."
 68 	"The Cube is said to have limitless dimension.  If so, it must
 69 be difficult to conceive.  How does one command tha which he cannot
 70 imagine?"
 71 	"One does not 'command' The Cube.  One entreats The Cube with
 72 magicks and incantations."
 73 	"To learn all of the spells will take much time.  If all of
 74 the students work, each can learn a different set at the same
 75 time.  Together, we can do what would take one many weeks in a short
 76 time."
 77 	"Very good."
 78 	"Teacher, at what level may we begin to use The Cube?"
 79 	"You have used The Cube already, Apprentice d1."

105  
106 "I am," She sat in the chair and kept her head tilted defiantly. Her speech
107 was deliberate and emphatic, without losing the rough tone that kept it from
108 sounding at all vulnerable. "Against your nation, your homeland, everything
109 your father died for during the War. And you," She looked out through the tall
110 windows and into the forests. "You are an officer of your laws. A lieutenant
111 in the National Police Force. Sworn to defend the Constitution of the United
112 States. Just get real. There is nothing for us together."
113  
114 He stood in his robe, and held a white mug in hands. Looking down and through
115 his own tears, he answered her. "My name is Pasha. I went to elementary school
116 in the Pacific Northwest. Grew up alone in a coastal town. After landing a job
117 with the Force, I met a wonderful girl on a trip to New York. I fell in love
118 with her, and want her to marry me. Isnt that real?"
119  
120 "I wish." She just frowned while staring into the forest scene. Arguing was
121 not her strong point, and neither was accepting the other point of view.
122  
123 "I love you." He had said it a thousand times in the last two years. Each time
124 in a different situation, although none was as grave as this. Imagining the
125 death penalty applied to your only love does that to most conversations, I
126 guess.
127  
128 "I am due on the dock in twenty minutes. In thirty minutes, I and this tube
129 are going to be on our way to an agent in the Sea of Japan. He poses as a
130 fisherman and ferries agents to and from Tokyo. A real hot spot, Tokyo. From
131 there, I go to Nichibitsu and deliver this tube to the twentieth floor. I get
132 eighty thousand to retire with for a few weeks. Then what?"
133  
134 Pasha looked out the window to avoid the challenge of looking to her while she
135 confessed. He nervously wondered if he ought to reach into his pocket for his
136 cuffs. He nervously wondered about what else she was going to say.
137  
138 "Another trip. Another apartment in the," She smiled as she thought of the
139 most elaborate phrase. "Bleak part of town. Another new secretary, quick
140 romance, and another mechanism gets sold to a wealthy Japanese manufacturer.
141 Its all very ordinary with me. I dont want to give it up, and I dont want to
142 take you with me."
143  
144 "I dont want to go, to Tokyo." His mind followed her on the ship there, into
145 the air conditioned offices of the Nichibitsu office tower. He could see her
146 white tank top and her cigarette and her defiant attitude. Then he returned to
147 his apartment on the West Coast of the States. "Let the damned Nichibitsu
148 corporation down. Spend your time with one person who loves you and wants you
149 to stay. Stay here, in this apartment," He added with deliberate emphasis and
150 care, "with me."
151  
152 She stood up and put her arms on his shoulders. Fondling the hair that fell in
153 front of his eyes, she told him he had absolutely wonderful eyes. She walked
154 out the front door. She drove her Porsche down to the dock. She was arrested
155 as soon as she stepped onto the wharf, and he got a robust promotion in return
156 for dropping a quarter on his only lover.

233 I was sitting in front of this cafe, which was about the only thing there
234 to do, when these two guys in black Triumphs came hauling around the dust.
235 One yells, Did I know where he could get a travelers check cashed in this
236 town. I'd been there three days, so I told him where the bank was. He told
237 me, get in, and I showed him and his friend where to go. We got to talking
238 he was in law school up in Connecticut. I told him about going to Columbia.
239 He got his check cashed and asked if I wanted to come along with them-
240 which was better than two bucks a night I didn't have, so I said, Yeah.
241 A whole bunch of kids were staying out on this island just off the coast.
242      One of the kids' fathers was head of a land development company
243 down there. The company had moved the fishermen who lived on the island
244 someplace else, built a whole bunch of hundred-and-fifty-thousand, two-
245 hundred-thousand dollar homes, lawns in the front, swimming pool on one
246 side, garage on the other, and boat house in the back onn the canal so
247 you could get your boat out to sea. They were all for the executives
248 of Dow Chemical, who just about owned the city. So prospective buyers
249 could check them out first, the houses were furnished, the freezers 
250 were filled with steaks, the closets stocked with liquor, towels in the
251 bathrooms and all the beds kept made. The executives could bring their
252 families in for a weekend to try out the house before they bought it.
253 On Monday, a truck would come by with maids, carpenters, plumbers. and
254 supplies to replace anything that had been used up, to clean out the
255 mess, and fix anything broken. There wasn't anybody on the island, so
256 the doors had all been left open. The kid's father had told him since
257 he was in the area, why didn't he stay there. So the kid, with about
258 n't he stay there. So the kid, with about
259 twenty of his friends-they went from about seventeen to twenty-five-
260 had moved in. They'd start on one house, drink up all the liquor, eat
261 up the food, destroy the furniture, break the windows, tear up every-
262 thing they could, then move on to another one. On Monday the maids,
263 carpenters, and plumbers would fix the damages. I stayed with them
264 for two weeks. I'd pick out a room, lock the door, annd read most of
265 the time, while all the noise went on outside. Every once in a while,
266 you know, I'd come out to get something to eat-wade through the beer
267 cans in the kitchen, scrape the grease out oof some pan and fry a
268 piece of steak. Then I'd go down to the swimming pool maybe if it 
269 wasn't too bad and, if there wasn't too much furniture floating in
270 it, or bottles, or broken glass around, I'd swim a while. Pretty soon,
271 when it would get too crowded, I'd go back to my room. There'd be
272 people in my bed, or somebody would've gotten sick all over the bureau,
273 So I'd take my book annd go lock myself in another room. A couple of
274 days after I got there, the two guys who'd brought me suddenly decided
275 to fly back somewhere else. They gave me the keys to the Triumphs and
276 said I could have them. I don't even know how to drive. One of them
277 had got the front smashed in by now, but the other one was still good.
278 The plice came twice. The first time the kids told them to get lost
279 and said they were supposed to be there, and the police went away.
280 The second time, I thought it was better I split. When the crap came
281 down, I wouldn't have any rich Texas relatives to run home to.

295 Emu: It looks like Mikey is fiddling with the low-level CC handling.  There
296 is other evidence of the same problem.  As for defaults, there are plans in
297 the works.
298 The Enter command now works perfectly if you just wait for a character to
299 echo before sending the next one.  BW does not echo the carriage return until
300 it is ready for another line.  I, myself, just use ZCOMM (subset of YAM) in
301 "tw" mode, i.e. "f -tw filename".  This sends at 8 char/sec and waits .7 sec

471 While I do not care what school anyone goes to, as the education one gets
472 is entirely dependant on the person receiving said education, one might be
473 able to determine the best school to attend based on a strict cost benefit 
474 analysis.
475 Determine first that which is important to you.  You must then assign units
476 of this measure to every facet of the experience.  Eg., if money is your
477 measure, then assign $ values to the cost of the education itself, the cost 
478 of living (to you) in each environment, the benefits of the social life,
479 the average income of graduates (I have seen statistics that show the median
480 income of graduates fall in this rank OSU, UO, PSU, OCE; but the differences
481 were only barely statistically significant).
482 You should also consider as many alternatives as possible.  If you can't think 
483 of 10 rational solutions to any problem, then you are not thinking, just
484 rotely regurgitating.
485 Apply these criteria, if money is your object, being sure to get as many of
486 the different costs and benefits tallied as you can.  If sex availability
487 is your criteria, then value things differently.  If it is pure research 
488 capabilities, again it's going to be different, with many values approaching
489 zero.
490 It can produce interesting results.

563@at the back of the saw, and paused for a moment, offering up a prayer to
564@whatever insane gods inhabited his tormented mind. Then he pulled the cord.
565@   The engine roared to life, its awful stuttering roar hammering deafeningly
566@off the concrete walls of the basement. He wound the engine up to an
567@earsplitting screech as he lowered the bar down onto the exposed flesh of
568@L'homme's leg.
569@   Whirling steel tore through the skin like a knife through paper. Blood and
570@tissue exploded from the wound, spraying everything in sight with crimson. He
571@forced the chainsaw farther down and the engine changed pitch as it began to
572@saw through bone. The corpse twitched as not quite dead nerves protested this
573@gross violation. Finally the saw was grinding into the wood of the table He
574@raised it up again. In a matter of moments, he had amputated the other limbs
575@and the head. He then shut the chainsaw off, setting it aside. Blood poured
576@from the raw stumps, pooling on the floor below.
577@   He reached for a large hammer nearby.
578@   Taking a giant swing, he slammed the claw part of the hammer into
579@L'homme's abdomen with a wet "thunk". The body jumped again, as if still
580@alive. He thought the mouth might open, emitting an agonized scream, but no,
581@that was too much to hope for. He yanked the hammer downwards, and the flesh
582@and muscle tore in a great gaping wound, sounding for all the world like
583@burlap.
584@   He took the hammer and quite expertly dismanteled the ribcage. Then he set
585@it aside in favor of a large, razor sharp butcher knife. In moments he had
586@the heart and lungs in a large plastic bucket. The intestines he wound up on
587@his shoulder like a garden hose and then he hung them on a hook that had
588@originally been placed there for a hose. He carefully lifted the liver out
589@and was about to place it in another bucket and his head jerked up suddenly
590@at a noise from above.
591@   Somebody was at the door.
592@   He dropped the liver back where it was and ran into the next room where
593@there was a shower. With quiet, practiced speed he washed the gore off his
594@body. Throwing on a robe, he ran up the stairs, careful to avoid tracking
595@blood up into the kitchen. He closed the basement door and snapped the large
596@silver combination padlock shut in the hasp. Then he went to the front door.
597@   It was Mikey, of course. With all the fun he had been having, he had
598@forgotten telling Mikey to come by. He apologized for making Mikey wait,
599@saying he had just been taking a bath. No, L'homme hadn't arrived yet, why
600@not have a seat while we wait for him?
601@   While Mikey sat, he went into the kitchen, supposedly to make tea. Another
602@large butcher knife hung on a rack on the wall. He took it down and caressed
603@its gleaming length. Yes, perfect. Planted right between the vertabrae, Mikey
604@would be dead before he even knew what hit him. Concealing the knife in his
605@robe, he brought the tea out into the front room.
606@   It was really quite good tea, and Mikey sipped it contentedly, unaware of
607@the dark figure that was sneaking up from behind the easy chair, eight inches
608@of deadly steel in its hand.
609@   A random twitch of nerves sent the hot tea spilling into Mikey's lap. Ow!
610@Damn! He bent over double from the pain and heard something rip behind him as
611@the chair shook. Looking up in surprise, he saw his erstwhile host struggling
612@to extract a large butcher knife from the back of the chair, where his head
613@had been a split second before.
614@   Damn! It wasn't supposed to go like this! Mikey had gotten up
615@and began backing away, surprise and wild fear in his eyes. The knife was
616@apparently hooked on a spring in the chair, and he couldn't get it loose. He
617@gave a mighty yank and heard a muffled 'sproiinng!' from the chair as the
618@knife pulled free. Hefting the knife, he advanced on his intended victim.
619@   Heart pounding, Mikey ducked into the kitchen. But there was only one door
620@there, and it had a lock on it. Panic boosting his strength tenfold, he
621@slammed his shoulder into the door. The flimsy hasp ripped loose and Mikey
622@all but fell down the stairs. He sat up on the cold wet concrete, shaking his
623@head to clear it. Then he saw the dismanteled body on the worktable. He
624@backed away from the grisley sight, against the wall. The wall was slimey,
625@and when he turned around he saw it was painted red with gore. His stomach
626@gave a great roll and heave as he backed away from the wall. His foot kicked
627@something heavy. He looked down. It was a bucket. Something in his mind
628@slipped, for just a second, and he muttered 'Oh. Hi, L'homme. I thought
629@you weren't here.' Then he returned to reality and screamed.
630@   In his haste to get away, he kicked the bucket over. L'homme's head rolled
631@across the floor and came to a rest against the far wall, grinning at Mikey
632@with dead, bloody lips. Black spots rolled in front of Mikey's eyes and he
633@knew he was going to faint.
634@   Then he saw the dark, robed figure at the base of the steps, and the glint
635@of the blade in his hand.
636@   Panic forced Mikey to move as the figure approached. Suddenly he was
637@within arm's length and the blade was raised to strike. Seeing a chance,
638@Mikey ducked under the man's arm, the blade just missing. He stood up and had
639@to duck again as the killer swung behind him while he turned. Mikey put the
640@worktable with the remains of L'homme's body between them. The stairs! If he
641@made it back upstairs, he could be out the front door and safe in no time.
642@   Just as Mikey made his move his opponent scrambled over the table with a
643@war cry. Surprised, Mikey couldn't dodge fast enough and he felt a bright,
644@sharp pain across his chest. He fell backwards and slammed into the wall hard
645@enough to make him see stars. He slid to the floor as slimy, heavy, cold
646@coils fell on him, draped around his neck. Gray and shiny, flecked with
647@bloodf, it took him a second to figure out what they really were. Then he
648@fought with his rising gorge as he struggled to get the damn things off of
649@him.
650@   His opponent was laughing. From the foot of the stairs.
651@   Mikey gathered the ropy coils and threw them at him. Then he ran back to
652@the table. The man shrugged off the mess and advanced on him slowly, knife
653@raised.
654@   Mikey's shirt was drenched in blood, but he figured the wound was probably
655@superficial, since he was still alive. Still, the blood loss was affecting
656@him, and he suddenly felt very tired. He knew right then that he was never
657@going to get out of here alive. He would be butchered just like L'homme and
658@God only knew how many others. And nobody would ever know.
659@   He was very close now. Mikey could hear his heavy, excited breathing. He
660@towered over Mikey darkly, gleaming death poised to strike in his hand.
661@Already Mikey imagined the cold steel plunging deep into his flesh, and the
662@pain, the awful pain...
663@   But he was just standing there, savoring the moment.
664@A shape caught Mikey's eye, off to one side. He had to stare at it for a
665@long moment, making himself believe he was seeing what he was seeing.
666@   A chainsaw.
667@   A quick prayer on his lips, he rolled to one side just as the man struck.
668@He felt another bright flash of pain in his left shoulder but it didn't
669@matter now. He couldn't let anything stop him.
670@   He grabbed the chainsaw's handle with his right hand, and with a burst of
671@almost superhuman strength, swung the heavy tool up and around. It slammed
672@into the man's midsection, knocking him backwards with a painful whoosh. He
673@quickly recovered, and advanced on Mikey, knife held before him.
674@   Mikey tried to move his left arm. Pain tore at his shoulder, making him
675@want to scream, but he could more. He grasped the small black knob and pulled
676@the cord.
677@   The engine purred, burped, and died.
678@   The man was giggling, and Mikey could feel insane laughter trying to
679@bubble up from somewhere within himself as well. This was just too much. He
680@yanked the cord again, and nothing.
681@   The man quit giggling and said the last words Mikey knew he would ever
682@hear:
683@   "Let's finish this."
684@   He dove in, knife before him. Mikey gave the cord one last, desperate
685@pull. He felt something tear and agony exploded in his shoulder as his arm
686@went limp. But the chainsaw roared to screaming life in his hand. The man
687@twisted, trying to avoid the deadly whirling teeth, and the tip of his knife
688@scored along the side of Mikey's face, cutting a bone deep gash just below
689@his right eye. Swinging his body around, using momentum as well as strength,
690@he swung the saw at him with everything he had. He felt the saw strike
691@something and was torn from his grasp. The motor choked and died and he fell
692@to the ground in deafening silence. And then he blacked out.
693@   It seemed a long time later when he opened his eyes. The dim single light
694@in the room blinded him, then his eyes adjusted and he could see again.
695@   The man was lying draped over L'homme's remains on the worktable, the
696@chainsaw protruding from his back. Shakily, Mikey got up and went over to
697@look. The saw had struck him from the left side and had chewed its way
698@through clear past the backbone before stopping. The man's face was twisted
699@in a rictus of agony and Mikey had to look away. But it was over.
700@   It took almost every bit of strength Mikey posessed to make it back up
701@those stairs. His chest and shoulder wounds were still bleeding heavily and
702@he could feel a large flap of skin hanging from the side of his face. He
703@needed help fast, before he bled to death. He grabbed the phone, knocking it
704@off the table. He fell after it, almost knocking himself out again. Fingers
705@rapidly going numb, he dialed emergency 911. Everything was going hazy. He
706@heard the phone ringing, as if from a great distance away as conciousness
707@slipped from him. Hold on, just long enough to give the address. Hold on...
708@   The phone clicked and a pleasant female voice said:
709@   "This is Portland Emergency. Please hold."
710@   Click.

768 	Morwin had said Milchar may be dead, but Grann didn't believe it.
769 The gnome felt something... but he was unsure of the thing he sensed.  It
770 was nebulous, not to be trusted- but insistent.
771 	Silence had fallen between the two for some minutes.  Morwin bent
772 over stones arranged in a small circle where a fire had once been, once more
773 intently examining them.  Grann sat still and tried to trace the silent tug
774 upon him.
775 	Abruptly, a faint shadow appeared over the nearby brook.  Slowly it
776 solidified into a familiar form- that of the R.S. Razor's Edge, the source
777 of the tugging.  Grann's heart leapt.  Was Milchar aboard?
778 	The gnome jumped up, racing toward the ship as bobbed gently in the
779 stream.  Morwin's gaze followed him for a moment, and then he too made his
780 way toward the Razor.
781 	Grann had already searched the ship as Morwin arrived on deck.  No
782 one was on board.  It was as if the Razor had somehow managed to drift back
783 to familiar shores, after some disaster at sea...
784 	"This was his ship, wasn't it, Grann?" asked Morwin.  "I can feel his
785 emanations here."  Morwin closed his eyes as he said this.
786 	"Yes."  Morwin seemed so sure that he was dead.
787 	Morwin looked about, seeking some clue.  His eyes settled on the
788 horizon.  "What is that?"
789 	Grann followed his gaze.  A multi-colored cloud on the horizon
790 approached at a terrific rate, obscuring everything beyond.  The air was
791 charged with power.  Milchar had mentioned this phenomena to his apprentice.
792 He had called them... what?  He couldn't remember.  What Grann did recall was
793 the fact that the storm twisted reality.  It was usually caused by huge
794 amounts of magickal energy suddenly released.  It was very dangerous... and
795 drawing nearer.  Suddenly Grann remembered.
796 	"Ether eddy.  Prepare yourself, we're 'setting sail' toward Celene.
797 Milchar's tower is proof against that sort of disturbance... if we can make
798 it in time."

877 	The Poet drifted in an endless mist; the chill seeped into his
878 bones  Once the power had been thick, so thick he'd swum in it, but now
879 it seemed thin, somehow warped, and wouldn't support him.  He couldn't
880 tell how long he'd been lost -- it seemed like forever.  He'd forgotten
881 what he was supposed to look for, but he knew it what the most important
882 thing in all the worlds. 
883 	Worlds? Why the plural? Something he was supposed to know... 
884 	Words floated to the top as he drifted...  work...  money... 
885 power...  lines...  force...  shift...  ale...  power...  reality... 
886 ale... lost...  ale... 
887 	His reverie was interrupted by a sudden feeling of otherness, as
888 though someone else had entered his mists.  Puzzled, the Poet cast about
889 himself for the source of the sensation.  It was vague, distant, but
890 unmistakeable. A woman's voice...  what was it saying?

893 	Waking suddenly, for a moment Pol couldn't tell where he was.  He
894 blinked and took a deep breath, and felt a rough wetness on his cheek. 
895 	Lady Helen. 
896 	"Hello, Hel-cat.  Hungry?" He reached up and stroked the neck of
897 the cat standing on his chest. 
898 	"Mrrip." Helen didn't waste words. 
899 	"Alright, alright, just give me a chance to pull on my pants..."
900 	Pol rolled over and groped for his pants, left (as always) on the chair
901 beside the bed.  Pants...  something was wrong there...  As he pulled
902 them on, his old well-worn jeans felt oddly confining. 
903 	"RrreuOww," said Helen, butting at his ankles. 
904 	"Hang on girl.  The floor's cold, just let me get something on my
905 feet."  His hand hovered over his running shoes for a moment, reached
906 back under the bed, and retrieved a pair of worn but sturdy sandals. 
907 He'd strapped them on his feet and started for the kitchen before he
908 thought to wonder about that.  He didn't even remember owning sandals. 
909 How did he know where they were?
910 	He walked to the kitchen, flipped on the light, and went to the
911 refrigerator for the cat food.  As he scraped it into a dish, he looked
912 at the clock.  Three in the morning! Shit.  He'd thought it was time to
913 get up.  Helen was now rumbling like a V-12 Jaguar, rubbing orgasmically
914 along his legs.  How could he put her food away now? Oh well... 
915 	Pol left the cat lapping at her food and went back to bed.  He lay
916 quiet for a time, searching for sleep...  and something else...  As he
917 began drifting off he felt Helen curl purring into his back.

924 However, you have *no* right to use someone else's property to say something.
925 You do *not* own this computer. The owner can do anything he likes with it.
926 By the way, attempting to destroy other people's postings may be a federal
927 offense under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. But it'll be a long
928 time before the courts sort that mess out.
929 In the meantime, just remember, the only rights you have on a BBS (unless you
930 are paying to use it) are those the Sysop chooses to give you! A good analogy 
931 is that if you are in my house, and start making objectionable coments I can 
932 *require* you to get off of my property.

936 Thanks for the words of wisdom Leonard.
937 We really appreciate you sharring.
938 WHAM homosexuals? sence? What is with a homosexual that sings about sex? Is 
939 there deeper meaning in such a covert statement?
940 What is the meaning of poor spelling?

960 Response of the day, which is also a question: What's "average"?  I have
961 had several in the past, but I am currently only using one (which is the
962 normal situation for me).  I do not switch aliases on a whim, but rather
963 I switch personas as the stories change- perhaps you will find this to be
964 "average"...

969 University of Oregon kicks ass. And that is not just whistling dixie! I'm a 
970 double major there, and thus can vouch for the integrity of TWO departments.
971 And besides that, Eugene is a lovely, if boring, city.
972 Sorry to butt in like this, but Parrot is down and I feel so displaced.
973 Oh, by the by.. I have a Commodore 64 with a 30mb. Hard disk and a Hercules 
974 Graphics card. I'm thinking of getting an AT keyboard for it, but I don't know
975 should buy a set of Joysticks for my Osborne first.
976 Wondering, wondering wondering.

980    So strange... so very, very strange.  And yet, so like it has always 
981 been.  The faces may be different, but the conversations are still sometimes 
982 brash and bold, sometimes timid... as they've always been.
983      It's good to know that some things can change for the better and still 
984 retain much of what was so special!
