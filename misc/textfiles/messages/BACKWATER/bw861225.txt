42    A pathetic sight was he. A tall, emaciated figure limping and muttering to himself on the dry, baked surface of the
43 desert. Noontime heatwaves made the horizon shimmer, enforcing the unreality of the situation. Each painful step sent
44 waves of pain shooting though his guts, and his head spun crazily at the effort each small movement required. He had
45 pushed himself far past human endurance, now only running on resources far too arcane to be understood by mere
46 mortals, yet he refused to quit. Vengence burned within him.
47    His name was James Forster Mandell, and he was dying.
48    He had jumped blindly from Kadan, and, instead of landing on Nexus as he had planned, he was now stranded on this
49 unknown desert world. he reserves were now wholly committed to keeping him alive. Escape from this planet was
50 impossible. All he could do now was bemoan his fate.
51    "Damn bitch." he muttered under his breath. "Somehow, I don't know how but I'm gonna kill her. She drove me to
52 this. Damned manipulating fat old-"
53    After many wearying hours of this I decided I had had enough. It was time to step in.
54    He stopped and stared up at me painfully. "Who the hell are you? And where did you come from?" He looked around,
55 seeing nothing but miles of horizon.
56    "I'm the guy who created you." I said, making my voice echo for effect.
57    He worked this through his dehydrated brain for a long moment before replying, "God?"
58    I laughed. "No. The writer."
59    I made him understand, so as to save time and writing space. "You..." he said with growng realization. "You're the
60 one responsible for all my troubles."
61    I smiled conceitedly and nodded.
62    I didn't think it possible. He still had enough energy to summon that stupid undefeatable sword of his. Blue fire
63 tore the air as the blade arced for my neck. I raised a hand in its path and the blade shattered on contact. He stared
64 in horror at the broken hilt in his hand. When he looked at me again I saw that he ws about to cry. He had no idea how
65 good this made me feel. "Why?" he asked, in a broken voice.
66    I considered, then decided to tell him the truth. "Because you're a nerd. You could have been great. You had the
67 potential to become the greatest hero ever seen in electronic communications. But instead you became a pathetic,
68 angst-ridden wretch. A nobody with a lot of power. Why do you think I sidetracked you? I'm going to bury you on this
69 nowhere planet, and never let your name be mentioned again. Nonexistance is your fate."
70    "No." he muttered. Great forces once thought exhausted built within his scrawney frame. Blue power crackled between
71 his fists. He raised his hands and a bolt of incredible destructive force shot out. Quite predictable, actually. I
72 raised my hand and the bolt bounced back, striking him down.
73    I walked over and knelt beside his wheezing form. A great blackened burn covered his chest, which barely moved. His
74 mouth tried to form words, but he had not the breath to speak.
75    I smiled down at him, deciding to drive the stake in deeper. "Don't worry about Tariya. Her new husband is keeping
76 er happy and well satisfied." I chuckled at the shock in his eyes. "More so than you ever could. They're expecting
77 their first baby any day now. It *has* been about eleven months since you left her. It just took me this long to
78 ecide what to do with you."
79   He reached up and grasped my shirt collar with the strength of an infant. Tears of impotent rage ran down his
80 cheeks. The wimp was actually crying again. I decided to finish it before I got sick.
81   I tapped his forehead, and that was it. The power drained from his body instantly. Without the power to sustain
82 him, his heart stopped and he expired quietly. Just a hunk of useless meat, which isn't really all that different from
83 what he was in life.
84    I got up and walked away quickly. My task done, I stepped out of the story.
85   All that remained was a pitiful corpse, left to soon dry and rot away in the barren sands.
86

107 The Innkeeper rode a dark and lonely road. The rain made a slippery 
108 mess of the road, and his well shod steed occasionally slippy in the 
109 water filled ruts. But on the Innkeeper rode. It would do no good to 
110 stop, there was no place really to stop. The rain drank up the light
111 of his lantern, and what little it gave back was reflected at crazy
112 angles making it very difficult to see. Sometimes a traveler could be
113 seen passing in the opposite direction as evidenced by their own lights,
114 But identification was not possible. Indeed, the very light from that
115 same lantern often would blind the Innkeeper making it difficult to even
116 see his own path. Cautiously he continued on, steering his steed to avoid
117 the worse of the water filled ruts. It would be good to get home from
118 the east mountain valley. This inceasent rain was dampening his spirits.
119 He followed the river most of the way, passing through the port town
120 on the bank of a small stream that feed the river, and soon he had 
121 passed through the town and moved on the familar road to home and the
122 Inn. Easing his stead into the stables, he bedded him down for the night,
123 and sloughed his weiry way to his rooms. Laying the packages down on a
124 convient table, he sank into his favorite chair to ease his bones from
125 the strenuous trip and soon was fast asleep.

257         little while.
258 
259 Carl/Cindi - Stop taking shots at the MMPI.  It is a very good diagnostic
260              tool, but has very little to say about writing being a
261               sublimation of sexuality.  If you are interested in more
262              about the MMPI, contact me, as I have several excellent 
263              lay referneces on the subject, as well as a software 
264              package for administrarion and scoring of same.
265 
266 All -  Help !!  Urgent need !!
267           This is a serious inquiry.  Have any of you out there had an
268           OOBE ?  Would you be willing to discuss it ?  Is there a
269            Parapsychology group on the system ?  Serious request for

281 Due to the internal organisation of the musical work, the act of listening to
282 it immobilizes passing time; it catches and unfolds it as one catches and
283 enfolds a cloth flapping in the wind. It folllows that by listening to music,
284 and while we are listening to it, we enter a kind of immortality.

330 Friar:
331 
332 Everyone knows that the MMPI is an anthropological dinosaur. I
333 can't believe you bought a program to score it. The only reason
334 it hasn't been declared obsolete is power psychiatric fuddy
335 duddys desperately cling to it rather than learn anything new.
336 
337 Even before the MMPI became obsolete it was of questionable 
338 value. Its norms are all based on mental patients which makes
339 it virtually useless with a normal population. Why don't you
340 look into the California Psychological Inventory (CPI); it's
341 norms are at least based on the thinking of normal people.
342 
343 I think it's time you got your thinking out of the dark ages.
344 The next thing you know you'll be telling me that you actually
345 believe it's significant if you fear catching germs off of
346 door nobs. Hey, kiddo, that's where some of the best germ 
347 are gonna be found.

456         "It's your death!" She replies boldly. She brek h 
457  puch around her neck and thrusts it towards them,
458        "touch me again and you and your wickedness wil r i
459          the contents of this purse!..."
460 But she'd found her courage too late. Calling her bluf,te 
461  apart the small purse, allowing a rain of white petal ofl

467       "Well -- who do you belong to Speak up, lass!"
468 He is perturbed: "What are you -- bull-headed, or justpans

471  glances back at him but says nothing.
472  continues his ranting: "If that's all the thanks I ge .Il

474 He wipes the blood off the blade of his axe. Next, he erhs
475 luables. In the dim light of the setting sun, he is unue u

490     It had been a long time since she had visited the Inn, but the rain
491 outside began whipping people, and she hoped for still waters.  It had
492 changed some but was still the same.  She hid herself in her dark cloak
493 and the hood was up to protect her from strangers.  True, the Inn was
494 filled with strangers.  Not a single face remembered.  "Strangers?",
495 she wondered, "or new costumes?"  She couldn't tell.  "They must be
496 strangers."  She turned around slowly.  "At least to me."
497     Politics raged in one corner, patriarchs.  She moved away.  She took
498 a drink and went over to the fire, noticing a stool that had once been
499 occupied by a true friend.  The chair had once seated a piper now seat a
500 boy scout?  Not even the old guard was resting, while scribbling notes in
501 a corner.  What of he that tried to weave dark with light?
502     She nursed her drink.  The fire crackled with life.  "Flames do not
503 die like people," she mumbled to herself, "they burn into our memories
504 good and bad.  Like this one, jumping and sparkling, casting an array
505 of shadows about the room.  Celebrating life, even when all I know is
506 gone.  I should dance with it."  But she did not.  She only glanced
507 around the room with tired eyes, as if she had grown old.  
508     Pegs on the wall for clothing.  No coats she recognized.  She looked
509 down at her feet.  Faint stains of blood could be seen beneath her shoes.
510 An old friend.  "I guess it's time we get moving," she said to her feet.
511     She stood to leave.  Gave one last look around... maybe even the ghost
512 of one other friend.  They hadn't seen each other for a long time.  Perhaps
513 the woman was gone.  Sure enough, she was...
514     As she was leaving, she looked down to see the Innkeeper fast asleep in
515 a great chair.  She could hardly contain her delight.  How had she missed
516 him?  "Well," she said to the unconscious man, not expecting him to answer,
517 "it has been along time!"  
518     The Innkeeper stirred in his sleep, but did not wake.  She thought
519 about nudging him, then realizing how rude that would be and how tired he
520 looked, decided against it.  She turned to leave, then stopped and sat
521 back in the shadows to wait for him.

556      As he approached the Inn, he felt a familar aura. A true lady, obviously,
557 but which? Pam? She had long been absent. D? She had been absent even 
558 longer. He couldn't quite make it out. Only one remedy! He opened the door.

561 The Innkeeper stired in his sleep. The warmth of the Inn's fire felt good
562 after such a long and tiring trip. As consiousness slowly returned, he
563 felt a pressure in the back of his head ever so slight. Someone was 
564 watching him from the shadows. Not for any foul deed, no it didn't feel 
565 that way...no, just the opposite...a friend, one I know...wakefulness 
566 comes finally, and with it the loss of 'sense'. But the knowledge 
567 remains. Opening his eyes, he looks about but doesn't see anything.
568 Hmmm could I be wrong? Stretching, he works the kinks out of muscles and
569 joints to the accomplement of various pops and snaps. Finishing it all
570 off with a long sigh.... But the presense is still there. How he knew he
571 was wasn't sure, maybe he could hear a slight movement, or the slight 
572 sound of breathing. Turning sharply he moved in the direction of the 
573 feeling. "Aha!" He cries out. "So it is you." Welcome to this humble
574 establishment we call the Inn. What can I serve you?"

577 That feeling ?  There it is.  The Rowan tree was shaking ever so
578 slightly in the heavy rain.  More a sensation than a movement.  I
579 will wait and see on that, but this other requires a response.

581 Cindi -  The MMPI is out of date, but the methods used to generate the
582 normative curves are not quite as you have heard.  The 'normal' people
583 were friends and relatives of the patients, not the patients.  The
584 abberations were of the patients, and were statistically valid.
585 Point the second - I did not purchase, but rather have developed a 
586 scoring module.  One must earn a living to support nights of revelry
587 in the Inn.
588 
589 All - again my serious plea about OOBEs.  (Although, on introspection
590 I feel that coming here is really a sort of OOBE.  What do you think,
591 Mr. Inkkeper?)
592 
593 Another B&B Mr. Innkeeper, as I must savor it until Mr. Rayguns imperiousness
594 has priced it beyond my reach.  (200 percent tariff indeed.  If the
595 colonists hated taxation without representation, they should have seen it 
596 with)

598 Happy or sad new year to all, as you wish.

606 A slight rumbling could be felt in the floor boards of the Inn. 
607 A high pitch whine emitted from behind a ragged curtain in the back
608 of the Inn. Disturbed, several patrons hurried to the curtain that 
609 covered the now well know metal door in the back of the Inn. Pulling it
610 aside, they could see a change had occured. The door had turned color
611 to a light brown. But most disturbing was that cracks had appeared
612 around the edges of the door and light could be seen shinning through
613 them, a white light unlike any had seen before. The openings of course
614 also allowed the noises that had been going on behind the door to increase
615 to a louder volume. This caused much concern and gave the patrons
616 much to talk about. "An interesting way to start the new year" bard was
617 heard to say. "But how?" said another, "What does it mean?"

622 My drink was forgotten in my hand as the floor rumbled.  A couple
623 of patrons looked at me for help.  (They did not know that I was
624 a friar of agnostics, not christians.)  I assured them that they
625 should save themselves.  Over the excitement, I could still feel a 
626 creeping sensation in the air, that someone was there that had been
627 before.  Maybe I was wrong.
628 We all sat down to welcome in the new year.  It being my third new
629 year at the inn.  How many have there been for others ? [][]  Friar [][]
