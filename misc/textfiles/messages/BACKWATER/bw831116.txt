25 Aaron: D: all of the above!
26 Having been thru this sort of thing myself, I have found that a resturant
27 (or other suitible establishment) is a better place to meet so as to
28 encourage those who are on the fringes to come. Public establishments 
29 are more comfortable when you don't know who you will be seeing.
30 So anyway, anyone else able to think of a good reason as to why I should
31 show up at this 'party'?
32 ************** CISTOP MIKEY ******** 12 NOV 83 ***** 11:30AM **************

59 WHICH IS THEN FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER CAUSES THE NUMBER OF LINES INDICATED
60 TO BE PRINTED, STARTING AT THE NEXT LINE FROM THE CURRENT LINE POSITION,
61 AND CONTINUING UNTIL THE NUMBER OF LINES REQUESTED HAVE BEEN PRINTED OUT.
62 THE CURRENT LINE POINTER WILL BE LEFT AT THE LAST LINE THAT WAS PRINTED.
63 IF THE NUMBER OF LINES REQUESTED IS GREATER THEN THE NUMBER OF LINES PRESENT
64 ON THE DISK, THEN PRINTING WILL STOP AT THE LAST LINE ON THE DISK, AND 
65 THE CURRENT LINE POINTER WILL ALSO BE LEFT POINTING TO THE LAST LINE ON THE

77 LINE 1 IS ASSUMED.
78 THE UP 10 COMMAND: THIS PLACES THE CURRENT LINE POINTER UP THE NUMBER OF 
79 LINES REQUESTED FROM THE CURRENT POSITION. I.E. IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY ON
80 LINE 30, AND YOU SAY UP 10, THEN YOU BE MOVED TO LINE 20. THIS COMMAND
81 MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN, THE 'UP' FOLLOWED BY A SINGLE SPACE FOLLOWED BY A
82 NUMBER. IF AN ATTEMPT TO GO PAST LINE 1 IS DONE, THEN IT WILL STOP AT LINE
83 1 AND STAY THERE. IF THE COMMAND IS INCORRECTLY GIVEN, OR THE NUMBER ZERO 
84 IS GIVEN, THEN AN 'UP 1' IS PERFORMED.
85 THE DO 10 COMMAND: THIS PLACES THE CURRENT LINE POINTER DOWN THE NUMBER OF
86 LINES REQUESTED FROM THE CURRENT POSITION. I.E. IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY ON
87 LINE 20, AND YOU SAY DO 10, THEN YOU WILL BE MOVED TO LINE 30. THIS COMMAND
88 MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN, THE 'DO' FOLLOWED BY A SINGLE SPACE, FOLLOWED BY
89 A NUMBER. IF AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO GO DOWN PAST THE LAST LINE ON THE DISK,
90 THEN IT WILL STOP AND REMAIN AT THE LAST LINE ON THE DISK. IF THE COMMAND

96 TYPING 'CC Y' WILL CAUSE ANY CONTROL CHARACTERS ENCOUNTERED TO BE SENT
97 AS CONTROL CHARACTERS. TYPING 'CC N' WILL CAUSE THEM TO BE CONVERTED
98 TO A PRINTABLE FORM (^A FOR CONTROL A, ECT.) THERE ARE A FEW EXCEPTIONS
99 TO THIS SUCH AS THE CARRAIGE RETURN AND LINE FEED WHICH ARE NOT CONVERTED.
100 A BACKSPACE CANNOT BE PLACED ON THE DISK, SO THERE IS NO CONVERSION.
101 AND A FORM FEED IS ALSO NOT CONVERTED THOUGH IT CAN BE PUT ON THE DISK.
102 THE RUBOUT (OR DELETE) IS SIMULAR TO THE BACK SPACE, AND IS NOT CONVERTED.
103 THE CC Y/N COMMAND MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN.
104 THE LF Y/N COMMAND: THIS COMMAND HAS TWO FORMS; 'LF Y' AND 'LF N'.
105 TYPING 'LF Y' WILL CAUSE ANY LINE FEEDS ENCOUNTERED TO BE SENT. (NOTE:
106 THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY SENDS A LINEFEED WHEN A CARRAIGE RETURN IS
107 ENCOUNTERED.) TYPING 'LF N' WILL PREVENT ANY LINEFEEDS FROM BEING SENT.
108 THIS COMMAND MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN.
109 THE EL Y/N COMMAND: THIS COMMAND HAS TWO FORMS: 'EL Y' AND 'EL N'.
110 TYPING 'EL Y' WILL CAUSE A 1/2 SECOND DELAY TO OCCUR AFTER EACH LINE
111 IS SENT. (THIS IS USEFULL WHEN USING SOME PRINTING TERMINALS SUCH AS
112 THE TI SILENT 700 SERIES.) TYPING 'EL N' WILL TURN OFF THE DELAY, AND
113 NO DELAY WILL OCCUR. THIS COMMAND MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN.
114 THE XT COMMAND: THIS CAUSES A TEST PATTERN TO BE SENT. IT WILL CONTINUE
115 TO BE SENT UNTIL A CONTROL C IS SENT TO STOP IT.
116 THE COMMAND MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN.
117 THE ON COMMAND: THIS WILL TURN ON THE DISK FOR OPERATIONS. THIS COMMAND
118 NEED NOT BE GIVEN, AS IT IS DONE AUTOMATICALLY WHEN NEEDED. THE
119 COMMAND MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN.
120 THE OFF COMMAND: THIS COMMAND WILL TURN OFF THE DISK, AND SAVE ALL 
121 CURRENT DATA. NORMALLY THIS COMMAND IS DONE AUTOMATICALLY, BUT NOT
122 ALWAYS. TO INSURE THAT ANY DATA YOU LEFT WILL NOT BE LOST, IT IS BEST
123 TO TYPE 'OFF' BEFORE HANGING UP. IF YOU DID NOT ENTER A MESSAGE, THEN
124 THIS NEED NOT BE DONE. THE OFF COMMAND MAY BE SHORTENED TO 'OF'.
125 THE ENTER COMMAND: THIS IS THE BIG ONE! USE THS COMMAND TO ENTER A 
126 MESSAGE ON THE SYSTEM. ANYTHING YOU TYPE AFTER GIVING THIS COMMAND 
127 BE ADDED TO THE END OF THE DISK. USE CONTROL C TO GET OUT OF THE ENTER
128 MODE AND RETURN TO THE COMMAND MODE, ALL OTHER CHARACTERS WILL BE
129 STORED TO THE DISK EXCEPT FOR BACKSPACE AND RUBOUT(DELETE) WHICH 
130 ARE USED TO ALLOW EDITING OF WHAT YOU ARE TYPING.
131 THE ENTER COMMAND CAN BE SHORTENED TO 'EN'.
132 THE EXIT COMMAND: THIS COMMAND EXITS YOU FROM THE COMMAND SECTION
133 AND PLACES YOU IN LIMBO. ANY CHARACTER YOU TYPE WILL BE ECHOED BACK TO
134 YOU, BUT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. USE CONTROL C TO GET BACK TO THE COMMAND
135 SECTION. THE COMMAND CAN BE SHORTENED TO 'EX'.
136 THE DA/DB COMMAND: THE COMMAND HAS TWO FORMS; 'DA' AND 'DB'.
137 TYPING 'DA' WILL PLACE YOU ON DISK A, AND TYPING DB WILL PLACE YOU
138 ON DISK B. ALL DISK HANDLING WILL BE DONE AUTOMATICALLY. THAT IS,
139 THE OLD DISK WILL BE TURNED OFF, AND YOU WILL BE PLACED AT LINE 1
140 OF THE NEW DISK. THE COMMAND MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN.
141 THE PX 51,6 COMMAND: THIS COMMAND IS FOR USE WITH PRINTERS, IT IS 
142 GIVEN IN THE FORM OF 'PX' FOLLOWED BY A SPACE, FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER
143 THAT EQUALS THE NUMBER OF LINES ON YOUR PAGE, FOLLOWED BY A COMMA,
144 FOLLOWED BY A NUMBER THAT EQUALS THE NUMBER OF LINES YOU WISH TO 
145 BE SKIPPED AT THE END OF EACH PAGE. THIS IS USED WITH 'FANFOLD' PAPER
146 TO 'SKIP' OVER THE PERFERATIONS AT THE PAGE BOUNDERIES. NORMALLY
147 THIS COMMAND IS INITIALIZED WITH PX 1,0 WHICH PREVENTS ANY SKIPPING
148 FROM OCCURING. THE COMMAND MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN.
149 THE MA 80 COMMAND: THIS COMMAND SETS THE MARGIN WHEN ENTERING DATA.
150 IT DOES NOT EFFECT THE DATA THAT IS PRINTED OUT HOWEVER. THE COMMAND IS
151 GIVEN IN THE FORM OF 'MA' FOLLOWED BY A SINGLE SPACE, FOLLOWED BY A 
152 NUMBER EQUAL TO THE LENGTH OF THE LINE YOU WISH TO LIMIT YOUR ENTERY TO.
153 WHEN ENTERING DATA, A CONTROL G (BELL) WILL BE SENT WHEN YOU ARE LESS
154 THEN SEVEN CHARACTERS FROM THE END OF THE LINE. THE SYSTEM WILL COME UP
155 WITH THE LAST KNOW MARGIN SETTING. THE COMMAND MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN.
156 THE CHANGE COMMAND: THE CHANGE COMMAND IS GIVEN IN THE FORM OF 
157 'CH /OLD/NEW/'. THE 'CH' MUST BE FOLLOWED BY A SINGLE SPACE. THIS
158 IS THEN FOLLOWED BY A 'DELIMITER' (THE DELIMITER MAY BE ANY
159 CHARACTER, NOT JUST '/'.) THEN THE DATA YOU WISH TO CHANGE, FOLLOWED
160 BY ANOTHER DELIMITER (MATCHING THE FIRST ONE YOU ENTERED), FOLLOWED
161 BY THE NEW DATA YOU WISH TO HAVE IN PLACE OF THE OLD DATA, FOLLOWED
162 BY ANOTHER DELIMITER (MATCHING THE FIRST AND SECOND DELIMITERS.).
163 THE FINAL DELIMITER MAY BE OPTIONALLY LEFT OFF. IF NO NEW DATA IS
164 GIVEN, THEN THE OLD DATA IS SIMPLY REMOVED WITHOUT REPLACING IT 
165 WITH ANYTHING. THE COMMAND MUST BE GIVEN AS SHOWN.
166 THE DELETE COMMAND: THE DELETE COMMAND WILL PREVENT THE CURRENT LINE
167 BEING POINTED AT FROM BEING PRINTED ANY MORE. WHEN THIS COMMAND IS 
168 GIVEN, THE LINE TO BE DELETED WILL BE PRINTED, AND YOU WILL BE ASKED
169 IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DELETE IT BEFORE THE DELETE WILL TAKE PLACE.
170 (I.E. DELETE ?) THE ONLY RESPONSE THAT WILL CAUSE THE LINE TO BE DELETED
171 IS A 'Y' FOLLOWED BY A CARRIAGE RETURN. THE COMMAND MAY BE SHORTENED TO
172 'DE'.
173 THE DE 10 COMMAND: THIS COMMAND WORKS THE SAME AS THE REGULAR DELETE
174 COMMAND, EXCEPT THAT THE CURRENT LINE POINTER IS PLACED AT THE REQUESTED
175 LINE NUMBER FIRST. THE COMMAND MUST BE GIVEN IN THE FORM OF 'DE' FOLLOWED
176 BY A SPACE, FOLLOWED BY THE LINE NUMBER OF THE LINE TO BE DELETED.
177 IF A NUMBER GREATER THEN
178 THE LAST LINE ON THE DISK IS GIVEN, THEN THE LAST LINE IS ASSUMED.
179 IF THE COMMAND IS INCORRECTLY GIVEN, THEN THE CURRENT LINE IS ASSUMED.
181 THE REPLACE COMMAND: THIS COMMAND WORKS LIKE THE DELETE COMMAND, EXCEPT
182 THAT INSTEAD OF DELETEING THE LINE, YOU ARE ASKED IF YOU WISH TO REPLACE IT.
183 IF YOU RESPOND WITH A 'Y' FOLLOWED BY A CARRAIGE RETURN, THEN YOU ARE 
184 PLACED IN THE ENTER MODE SO AS TO ENTER THAT ONE LINE. (WHEN DONE, IT
185 AUTOMATICALLY EXITS THE ENTER MODE.) THE REPLACE COMMAND CAN BE SHORTENDED
186 TO 'RE'.
187 THE RE 10 COMMAND: THIS COMMAND WORKS LIKE THE NORMAL REPLACE COMMAND, EXCEPT
188 AS WITH THE DE 10 COMMAND, THE CURRENT LINE POINTER IS PLACED AT THE REQUESTED 
189 LINE NUMBER BEFORE THE REPLACE COMMAND IS PERFORMED. THE COMMAND IS GIVEN IN
190 THE FORM OF 'RE' FOLLOWED BAY A SPACE FOLLOWED BY THE NUMBER OF THE LINE YOU
191 WISH TO REPLACE. IF A NUMBER GREATER THEN THE NUMBER OF LINES ON THE DISK IS
192 GIVEN, THEN THE LAST LINE ON THE DISK IS ASSUMED. IF THE COMMAND IS INCORRECTLY
193 GIVEN, THEN THE CURRENT LINE IS ASSUMED.
194 THE FA DATA COMMAND: THIS COMMAND IS USED TO FIND ALL OCCURANCES OF
195 A PARTICULAR CHARACTER STRING. NORMALLY THE LINE NUMBERS ARE TURNED
196 ON BEFORE USING THIS COMMAND SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHERE THE DATA
197 IS ON THE DISK. TYPING 'FA MIKE' WILL CAUSE ALL LINES ON THE DISK
198 CONTAINING THE CHARACTERS 'MIKE' TO BE PRINTED. THE COMMAND MUST
199 BE GIVEN AS SHOWN.
200 THE FI DATA COMMAND: THIS COMMAND WORKS LIKE THE FA DATA COMMAND, 
201 EXCEPT THAT IT WILL STOP ON THE FIRST LINE ENCOUNTERED THAT HAS THE
202 CHARACTER STRING REQUESTED IN IT. THE CURRENT LINE POINTER IS LEFT 
203 POINTING AT THIS LINE. TO FIND THE NEXT OCCURANCE OF THE CHARACTER 
204 STRING, THE SAME COMMAND IS GIVEN AGAIN. (I.E. IF YOU SAID 'FI MIKE'
205 BEFORE, AND YOU SAY 'FI MIKE' AGAIN, THEN THE NEXT OCCURANCE OF
206 MIKE WILL BE SEARCHED FOR. IF YOU TYPE SOME OTHER CHARACTER STRING,
207 THEN SEARCHING BEGINS FROM LINE ONE AGAIN.
208 (I.E. IF YOU SAID 'FI MIKE' AND IT STOPED AT LINE 20, AND THEN SAID
209 'FI DATA', IT WOULD GO BACK TO LINE 1 AND RESTART SEARCHING NOW FOR
210 DATA AND NOT MIKE. THE ONLY TIME IT WILL CONTINUE SEARCHING FORWARD
211 FROM THE CURRENT LINE IS WHEN YOU GIVE IT THE SAME COMMAND AGAIN.)
212 DEFAULT CONDITIONS: WHEN YOU COME ON TO THE SYSTEM, IT  WILL BE SETUP
213 WITH LINE NUMBERS OFF, CONTROL CHARATERS OPERABLE, LINE FEEDS WILL BE
214 SENT, NO END OF LINE DELAY WILL BE PERFORMED. THE PAGE CONTROL WILL BE
215 DISABLED, DRIVE A WILL BE SELECTED, THE SYSTEM WILL BE OFF, THE MARGIN
216 WILL BE SET AT THE LAST KNOWN VALUE, AND THE CURRENT LINE POINTER
217 WILL BE PLACED AT LINE 1.
218 OTHER FEATURES: TYPING CONTROL H (BASKSPACE) WILL ERASE THE LAST CHARACTER
219 ENTERED. IT WILL CAUSE THE CURSOR TO BACKUP ONE POSITION, AND ERASE THE
220 CHARACTER. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR PRINTERS, SO THE RUBOUT(DELETE) COMMAND
221 IS ALSO PROVIDED. THIS JUST CAUSES THE PRINT HEAD TO BACKUP ONE CHARACTER
222 AND OVERSTRIKE THE CHARACTER WITH A '\'. IF THE NEXT CHARACTER THAT IS 
223 ENTERED IS NOT A RUBOUT (DELETE), THEN A LINEFEED IS DONE, AND THE NEW 
224 CHARACTER IS PRINTED BELOW THE OLD ONE. (IF ANOTHER RUBOUT IS SENT, THEN
225 THE BACKUP AND OVERSTRIKE IS DONE AGIAN.)
226 WHEN PRINTING OUT THE MESSAGES ON THE DISK IT CAN BE SUSPENDED AT ANY
227 TIME BY SENDING A CONTROL S. TO CONTINUE PRINTING AGAIN, SEND A CONTROL Q.
228 (ACTUALY ANY CHARACTER WILL RESTART THE PRINTING, EVEN ANOTHER CONTROL S.)
229 TYPING A CONTROL C AT ANYTIME WILL CAUSE YOU TO GO BACK TO THE COMMAND MODE
230 (AN EXCEPTION IS IF YOU STOPPED PRINTING WITH CONTROL S IN WHICH CASE THE 
231 CONTROL C WILL RESTART THE PRINTING INSTEAD OF GOING BACK TO COMMAND MODE.
232 TYPING A SECOND CONTROL C WILL CAUSE YOU TO THEN GO BACK TO THE COMMAND MODE.
233 AS AN ALTERNATIVE, THE BREAK FUNCTION WILL DO THE SAME THING AS THE CONTROL C
234 (NOT ALL BREAKS SEEM TO WORK HOWEVER, BWMS REQUIRES A BREAK SIGNAL THAT IS
235 500MS OR LONGER TO WORK, AND NOT ALL SYSTEMS SEND A BREAK THAT LASTS THAT
236 LONG.)
237 AND THERE YOU HAVE IT, A NOT SO QUICK DESCRIPTION OF BWMS IN 200 OR SO LINES.

255    Yes I read your message. I have been trying to call the system all dat
256 long but the system was busy. Part of that was our helpful sysop giving
257 us a big help file to read. (Thanks Mikey!)
258 As I said before, our age difference is 3 years, and if that is not a big
259 hang-up for you, then I think we should meet at CTC. There are plenty of
260 things to do there, and it is not too far from where I live, probably
261 15-20 minutes on I-205.  By the way, sorry to hear OCHS lost their football
262 game. The high school I went to lost also... C'est la vie!
263 So when do you want to meet(if you still do?) I can accept rejection
264 (i hope)... Well...what will it be.

270 eNOUGH Lovey Dubby! What is the latest word on the party? Although the perso
271 who offered the use of their home is very gracious, I doubt a BWMS party
272 would meet criterion #2 (National Disaster Area).
273 Restaurants have insurance for stuff like that...But I think we should do
274 more than have a 'pizza party'. That is almost getting to be old stuff
275 and the group that uses this system is too...what is the word I am looking
276 for...diverse shall we say, for something as mundane as a pizza party.
277 Hey...what about Lung Fung's Chinese(whoops I forgot, Mikey is allergic)
278 How about spot 79? Now there is a night club worthy of our presence. The
279 Carriage Room downtown might be a good choice too. What da ya think?

284 motivaters Aaron mentioned would entice you to literally mix with the
285 Backwater crowd...Hroth, you may count me in; (Deb had earlier expressed
286 an interest in such a meeting, but her time is severely limited, so I
287 can't vouch for her.)  I am truly surprised that the interest expressed
288 is so public regarding this get-together, for I suspect that many have
289 doubts about whether physical facts will constitute barriers between us
290 all...I myself am reluctant to shatter the magical illusions--both my
291 own and those I have wrought of myself--and wistfully wish that I could
292 come in quiet slippers to watch from the outside...but curiousity burns,
293 and I have yearned to meet my old friends for more than a year!  There,

303 Luke: I still would like to meet you. I am not one for rejection however. I 
304 am glad you still want to meet me. Alot of guys ask to meet me then back do-
305 wn. I hope you don't do that. My poor little heart couldn't take it. Yes....
306 our football team did bad. BUT!!!! If you were at the game then you probably
307 saw me. Our marchingband(which I am a part of) did the halftime show(as bad 
308 it was). We placed third that day at the biggest Veterens Day Parade in the
309 nation. We usually place first but we had a bad year with the budget cut and
310 then being reinstated. Only 3 years? That isn't bad. At least your not 30. I
311 don't think I could handle that. Name a date to meet. A suggestion though...
312 the weekends are best for me,but,the weekend of the 18th-20th Ii will be out
313 of town. Did you say you were a wizard? Actually an aprentice. If it was you
314 then let me know cause I forgot who it was. BCNUL8R m'love.

323 Ma Jody,
324 
325      No I wasn't at the football game, but I do read the sports page every
326 day. I am a real fan of athletics, I always believe in a sound mind through
327 study and a sound body through athletics. What instrument do you play? I
328 used to be in the marching band too, I even marches through the horse %#$%
329 at the Rose Parade one year! What a mess...
330 Sounds like you want to meet, CTC is the place, now we have to decide
331 where there to meet. Any suggestions? Are you sure you want to do this?
332 Don't worry about me though, if you say yes, I'll be there. I am a 
333 dependable Ice cream man, and I never miss my regular stops!
334 Could this be magic...you know the author of that one.

348 will be there. I can't think off the top of my head who wrote 'Could thi
349 s Be Magic' but I used to know. Am I right in guessing you are familiar with
350 Van Halen? I like conversing with you like this... it is at times most flat-

352 Do you think they are. Do they think they are??? I played clarinet last
353 year and the tri-toms this year. If you are aquainted with the toms then you
354 know they are heavy. Well incase you are wondering if I'm built like a tra-

370 found as topics for discussion at the Inn!  It makes my heart glad to 
371 follow the romance that seems to be growing right here on our own BWMS
372 .  Good for you, Luke and Jody!  The rest of you, take note!

386 To Aaron...My deepest apologies for infringing on your border. Remember
387 imitation is the finest form of flattery. As you can see I have changed.
388 Again...sorry.
389 To C.Y.M... How un-nice can you be. I think it is indeed interesting to
390 have a budding relationship develope before our eyes. Maybe we will have
391 an on-line marriage in a few months like they did on Compuserve. Don't
392 be so critical of other people.
393 To Party-arrangers...A night club was a little unthoughtful of me, I forgot
394 for the moment we have younger ones amoungts our midsts. Anon/20, the 20
395 must refer to your age? We need to find a place where all ages can enjoy
396 themselves equally. Let's keep thinking!
397 To Luke and Jody...Good luck!

435  can we set the get-together for next weekend?
436 
437  I would be more than happy to make any arrangments necessary; as someone
438 (above) suggested, a restaurant (I think) would be exceptional. I picture
439 a fire-place, converstion pit, backgammon tables, darts and all the other
440 trappings of a relaxed environment as a must for our location. Tonight
441 , on TRI-MET, I rode by a place call "Darwin's Theory"; it looked intresting
442 though I don't go in for the tavern format (i am a non-abuser); has anyone
443 been in there?
444  What about my suggestion that we buy Mike a dinner? Couldn't cost us
445 more than a dollar each....

471      WELL, I HAVEN'T COMMENTED ON THE BUDDING ROMANCE, MOSTLY BECAUSE 
472 I THINK THAT IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.  BUT I'M AFRAID I AGREE (IN 
473 INTENT, IF NOT DEGREE) WITH THOSE THAT DON'T LIKE IT.  WHILE IT IS NICE
474 THAT THEY CAN HAVE SUCH A MARVELOUS RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPING, I FIND THAT
475 I FEEL LIKE A VOYEUR, PEEKING IN WHERE I DON'T BELONG, OR A NOSY PERSON
476 READING SOMEONE ELSE'S DIARY AND LETTERS.  AS THE MATTERS BEING DISCUSSED
477 ARE SOMEWHAT PERSONAL, NOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIP HAS GOTTEN STARTED,
478 PERHAPS IT COULD BE MOVED TO A BBS THAT HAS PRIVATE MESSAGES.  UNLESS 
479 THE RELATIONSHIP IS BEING CONDUCTED FOR OUR AMUSEMENT RATHER THAN FOR 
480 THE JOY IT BRINGS TO IT'S PARTICIPANTS.  I THINK THAT YOUNG LOVE IS GREAT,
481 I JUST WOULD RATHER IT WAS MOVED TO A DARK, QUIET BOOTH NEAR THE BACK OF
482 THE INN WHERE THE LOVERS COULD BILL AND COO TO THEIR HEARTS CONTENT.  
483 THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY BOTHERS ME IS THE "LURKER SYNDROME" THAT HAS
484 DEVELOPED (SORRY LURKER), WHEREIN THE BBS IS USED FOR HOURS BY ONE PERSON,
485 AND NOTHING IS LEFT.  I LURKED FOR AWHILE BEFORE I LEFT MY FIRST MESSAGE,
486 AS I DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE SPACE WITH A LOT OF:
487 EXIT
488 OFF
489 SAVE
490 AND OTHER SILLYNESS.  THIS KIND OF THING COMES FROM NOT READING THE HELP
491 FILE OR THE INTRODUCTION BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO LEAVE A MESSAGE.  THE 
492 YOUNG LOVERS BOTHER ME MUCH LESS THAN THIS.

497 Aaron: this weekend is a bad one for me. Do yu think we could make it next 
498 weekend? I think buying our lovely sysop a dinner would be a good idea. I 
499 would most certainly chip in. If it is on a date I can attend.

507 As the storm clouds gather, and I prepare to wash my car, I see a growing
508 interest/and/or/resentment to the messages Jody and I have left each other.
509 I feel bad that it has instilled a bit of anger in some of the fine patrons 
510 of the BWMS Inn. I apologize if we have intruded on the otherwise quite
511 intellectual conversations that have been going on here. In a word of praise
512 though, I know of no other system in town where the format would have
513 facilitated our messages the way BWMS does. And with this in mind, I again
514 wish to thank the sysop/innkeeper, and the other users for allowing us to
515 use one of the Inn's tables. I am in a quandary...I don't really want to
516 go to another BBS, at least not yet, but I also don't wish to anger any
517 more of the patrons. If most people would like to see us move away from
518 the inn, I will accept(with a tear in my eye) their wishes. But I would
519 still like the privilage to return to the inn to read and discuss whatever
520 the current subject it. I hope you will grant me that. To those who
521 gave us your best wishes, thank you very much. To those who don't like
522 what is going on, I am deeply sorry to have angered you.
523 To Jody, let's see what the other patrons say. We might have our minds
524 made up for this, because I don't want to stay where we are not wanted.
525 If and when we meet, I am sure we can have some fun. And even if this doesn'
526 t turn out as some might expect, I am sure I will have found a new frien,
527 and I hope you feel the same too. Utill your next message...
528 ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| Luke ||||||||||||||||||||||||
529 ps I am very willing to chip in the buy the sysop dinner too. I think it 
530 is the least we can do for such a service as BWMS!
531 I am interested in knowing what type of hardware you have for your system
532 Leave a message on the system and I'll back in later.
533 Thanks alot........Bart

543 Thanks for the Welcome Aaron. I hope to take more of an active part in
544 the goings on at BWMS. I found out about the system of all places at OryCon!
545 I was talking to a new acquaintance down there and he told me about an
546 'interesting' sys
547 He gave me the number and loand behold, here I am. I originally got my
548 modem to talk to the DEC at work, but this is much more enjoyable. After
549 reading through all the messages on both disks, and seeing all the
550 'interesting' aliases, I decided I had to have one to. I assume your name
551 is real, or some mythical being from folklore? Supper is almost ready
552 so I better be going. Nice chatting with you.
553 ............The dropped Bit...........................................
554 <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
555 
556  dropped bit: ORYCON? do tell, what was it like. And perchance, what DEC
557 might you be working on? system 20? VAX? 
558 
559  PAM: sigh...the inn grows cold as the winter approaches, i see that you
560 also begin to feel the chill......
561 
562  ALL: Would anyone out there be intrested in yet ANOTHER (groan..) BB?
563 I have several systems sitting around, and i am tyoing with the idea of 
564 setting one up. It would be a members-only system; i would have a meterered
565 phone line(outgoing! how could ANYONE not have a metered line for a BB?!? 
566 the cost difference is $5 (met) to $15 (unmet) ); and would charge the users
567   1/nth (n being the number of users) of the operation costs of the system.
568 (probably about $.75 a month)...membership critera would be past performance
569 on other systems..All of the BWMS users would be elligible immediatly; I
570 know all of you.
571   
572   As for format,it would be login w/password ( i dont need your real name,
573 just so i get the $.75 each month is fine, if you wish to remain anon.),
574 would support a screen editor (for you CRT users), a good line editor, a
575 BWMS style "forum" (with several major difference, but the free format idea
576 would remain)..a standard BB type "messge" system , and a few other niceties
577 (i dont know which system i will put this on....IF I GET ENUF ENCOUARGEMENT
578 I WILL PUT IT ON MY LSI-2 AND MAKE IT  ****  MULTI-USER  **** (with an
579 equitable raise in the 1/nth membership fee, for extra phone lines)..but 
580 then again, i dont want to tie up a backplane/cpu/mem board/DZ/disk drives/
581 diskcontroller for a garbage little BB, so no one encourage me, please...I
582 stick it on the OSI instead...) 
583   I would like to bring up a MAJOR strength of my system: NO LURKERS (except
584 for "Lurker", depending on what i see of him here),NO BUBBLEGUMMERS (yes,
585  (gulp) neither PJody nor Luke nor (gulp gulp) Chris B. would have acces
586 s to the system)...in fact..I think I will let the current population of
587 my BB system debate, and vote on who will be in and who wont (except for the
588 first 20  or so users....i dont want my system to be one-sided..i welcome
589 Dave, Deborah...and all the others who I have qualms with their belief 
590 structure, yet not their BB etiquite...I WANT TO ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY!!  )
591 
592 i've had my say......

608 WELL NOW!
609     DEAR JODY & LUKE: ROMANCE TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT. A LOT OF THESE 
610 SOURPUSSES HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT IT'S LIKE. ALSO MY GUESS IS THAT A LOT 
611 OF THEM WERE NEVER VERY COMPETENT OR OUTGOING IN THAT AREA TO BEGIN WITH,
612 OR THEY WOULDN'T BE SO HOSTILE - PART OF THE TECHNONERD PHENOMENA. SO
613 GO FOR IT.
614     TO BE FAIR THOUGH, LUKE, I DO KIND OF FIND MYSELF WISHING THAT YOU 
615 WOULD GET OFF THE DIME, GET JODY'S PHONE NUMBER, AND INITIATE CONTACT.
616 THIS IS NO TIME TO GET THE JITTERS. AND THE DANCING AROUND THE ISSUE IS
617 CAUSING THE LENGTH AND NUMBER OF YOUR MESSAGES ON THE SUBJECT, WHICH IS
618 STIRRING UP YOUR DETRACTORS. THAT IS TO SAY - DONT PROCRASTINATE.
619    AS FOR YOUR SUGGESTION THAT YOU LEAVE THE SYSTEM, I AM AGAST AT THE
620 PROSPECT. YOUR'S IS THE ONLY EMOTIONAL (NOT A DIRTY WORD) CONTENT OTHER
621 THAN ACRIMONIOUS AND BITTER EXCHANGES WE'VE HAD FOR A WHILE HERE AND
622 GIVEN A CHOICE I'D RATHER GET RID OF YOUR CRITICS. (NO I DON'T REALLY
623 WANT TO GET RID OF YOU EITHER, CRITICS. JUST LIGHTEN UP ON THESE TWO!)
624    MANY OF THE OLDER ONES HAVE FORGOTTEN SOME OF THE INCONVENIENCES OF
625 BEING YOUNG. LIKE NO APARTMENT, NO TELEPHONE OF ONES OWN, NO CAR, NO MONEY,
626 NO ADMITTANCE TO ROMANTIC LITTLE BARS THAT ARE MADE FOR THIS STUFF.
627    IF ONE HAS NO SPACE OF ONE'S OWN, ROMANCE WILL TEND TO BE A LITTLE
628 PUBLIC. BETTER PUBLIC ROMANCE THAN NO ROMANCE.
629 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CONTINUED ON NEXT DISK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
