57     As I entered the briefing room, I saw I wasn't the first one there.  Seated
58 near the back of the room was a familiar bulk, straining the folding chair he
59 occupied.  "Good afternoon, Joshua," he said.  "Greetings, Ian," I replied as I
60 kicked a chair around to face him.  "I'm honored.  Being briefed by the high
61 muckamuck hisself.  Is anyone else coming, or am I it?" 
62 Ignoring my sarcasm, Ian rose heavily, moved to the door, and locked it.
63 "As you say, you're 'it'.  The situation is both critical and touchy, so we
64 can't afford to have it too widely known.  Just you and a few other key
65 operatives, such as parity and Fellows.  They're already in the field, checking
66 out leads.  You'll be put in touch with them to coordinate your efforts when we
67 finish up here."
68 I was starting to fidget.  Ian, as usual, was circling around the subject,
69 telling me everything I might need to know except what the basic problem was.
70 I knew by now that it would do no good to interrupt him or try to hurry him
71 along - in both size and temperment he resembled a glacier - slow but
72 inexorable.  Finally, though, he got to the point.  "One of my android doubles,
73 the ones you take such perverse delight in destroying, has malfunctioned."
74 Ian's eyes glinted as he said this.  "It apparently believes it truly is me.
75 It has taken documents which would be of value to it on the outside, and it has
76 effectively disappeared.  You can see why we want to keep this as quiet as
77 possible.  Most of our own people aren't aware of the android's existence, and
78 if word got out to the intelligence community, we would lose much credibility.
79 Parity is a good all-round agent, and you have several times proven your, ahem,
80 ability, to deal with the androids.  It is imperative that we take care of this
81 matter as quickly and quietly as possible."
82     I was stunned.  Ian's androids were incredibly capable machines.  They were
83 fully autonomous after being given basic instructions.  They were faster and
84 stronger than human, and could logically outthink us, although we still had the
85 intuitive edge.  They had numerous built-in weapons.  The fact that there was a
86 wild one loose who-knows-where doing god-knows-what scared me.  Sure, I had
87 managed to destroy a few, but those were in contrived setups, where I had had
88 a chance to lay some groundwork based on known routines.  They were also
89 experimental models. This one was for real, and I didn't like the odds one bit.
90     Ian continued, "I have had a file prepared detailing all the pertinent 
91 information regarding the android's offensive and defensive capabilities, along
92 with some engineering data that might provide insight into any potential points
93 of attack."  He handed a folder to me as he sat back down next to me, his chair
94 groaning protestingly.  As I scanned through the sheets, Ian asked, "do you see
95 anything that might be useful?"
96 "Nothing offhand that'll make it any easier."  The dossier listed the few
97 differences between Ian and the androids, such as the android's extra weight,
98 and the fact that the androids actually spoke better than Ian.  That last was
99 humorous, as Ian's speech was littered with 'uh's, 'er's, and long pauses.
100 It looked like reality was catching up with fantasy, though, as Ian had been
101 talking for quite a while now with nary a stammer.
102 My introspection was broken by Ian, again asking, "do you see anything
103 significant, or perhaps something missing which *should* be there?"
104 Hmmm, he seemed to be pressing the point.  I read through the material again,
105 looking for what wasn't there, a difficult task at best.  Finally I found what
106 he was apparently after.  "There's no mention of the verbal self-destruct
107 phrase.  Granted it's difficult to use without injuring or killing the speaker,
108 it should certainly be in here.  Why isn't it?"
109 Ian frowned, paused, then said, "I imagine it's because it IS such a dangerous
110 tool.  It's never written down, in case it's inadvertently read out loud by an
111 unknowing agent or secretary.  It's only passed verbally, and then only in
112 secure conditions, such as this."  Ian leaned closer, his chair squeaking
113 alarmingly.  "Since it's important that you have it right, please say the
114 phrase for me so I can check your pronunciation."  I thought a moment, trying
115 to remember the correct inflection.  As I began to say it, I noticed a crack
116 slowly working its way across the leg of Ian's chair.  The boss about to lose
117 his dignity?  Grinning slightly in anticipation, I opened my mouth.  "Deus... "

156 10 days away.  And less than 600 lines.  That's less than 60 lines a day!  At
157 ten (very short) lines a message, that is only six people calling a day.  
158 (That's assuming that everyone who calls writes...we all do that, don't we?)
159      Oh well, I guess I should do something better than complaining about the
160 lack of messages.  Hmm...
161      Didn't you all hear?  All Class 3 Entropy reduction machines have been
162 recalled!  The Techtronix factory has sent off another 50,000 workers, putting
163 the unemployment average in Oregon6.1 to
164 4.2%, an new record for the decade.
165     Also, the Fujitsu factory in Troutdale has swiched over to manufacturing
166 portable fusion reactors for your coffee makers.  This change has added a few
167 more jobs in the area, which has caused the population grow to 36,000.
168      Any person who wishes to join the fleet of Delta ships should call the
169 office right away, or else the applications will be closed.  And that is the
170 only way to get the entropy reducers that work.  (You get them after the run is
171 over...)

231                              Silvermere gossip 3
232     Hello again brave and hardy adventurers!  Welcome once again to the Silvermere gossip column.  I'm Jong Hines, Prime 
233 editor of this column and I'll be bringing you the top stories today.
234     Once again the mighty city if Silvermere has had it's share of adventures.  Although recently it seems as if they are 
235 all away from the city proper (for which the council is thankful).  
236     Dark tidings abode for our fair land, as is slowly being found.  The nation of Bolgokz, in the dark side to the has 
237 been very active lately and much activity of orcs, goblins, and other evil creatures from that nation have been noticed in
238 the area.  Adventurers have been sent to dispatch some of these small tribes, but reports of raids keep coming in.  The 
239 city council is worried and fear that the nation of Silvenari will soon be embroiled in a war with Bolgokz.  
240     A few weeks ago, Thalor Hansek, son of Allenor Hansek, military leader of Silvermere, singlehandedly dispatched 30 orcs
241 in their cave complex to the south.  Although that was Thalor's first foray into the world of adventuring, he proved h
242 self worthy of the title PALADIN.  He gained a bit of treasure for himself and then payed for training to improve himself 
243 even more.  
244     Thalor's adventures were far from over though.  He went to the Blue Horn tavern to try to turn some drunkards from their
245 evil ways and lo, he met a group already talking.  He joined in and found that they were seeking adventure and fame.
246     They joined their talents and formed The Crusaders.  Mayor Karan heard about this group and contacted them for an a
247 audience.  Upon arrival, they were told that Mayor Karan had a job for them.  They followed up on this and found that
248 a caravan going to the temple of Tyr in the Cliff plains needed protection from bandits.  The group readily accepted the
249 job, especially when they found out it payed 500 gold per protector.  Thalor was appointed leader with appropriate pay 
250 increase.
251     The next morning they set off.  The first few days went fine until Thalor, who was scouting ahead on his warhorse
252 came upon a group of people on the road.  The encounter would have been ordinary except that as he passed, they sneere
253 at him in contempt.  He wheeled his horse and leveled his 14' lance.  A paladin's wrath is a terrible and dangerous thing.
254 Thalor slapped his horse and charged.  The other group broke their ranks and scattered, but not before one of their number,
255 a dwarf, was skewered by the charging lance.
256     It was a full scale combat then and they went into a weird formation.  Thalor frowned and tried to analyze this.  
257 The man armored in leather seemed to be the leader.  If he could take out him, he could demoralize the others.  Once 
258 again the mighty clydesdale warhorse charged.  The formation was broken, but not before the leader sent a spell at
259 Thalor.  He groaned in pain as 4 magic missiles hit him.  Thalor was confused.  How could a wizard cast spells when he
260 wore armor?  He reanalyzed his attack strategy and decided on another plan.  He wateched perplexedly as the wizard took 
261 out a great bow.  Once again resuming his broken charge, he flew towards the group.  The fighters in front scattered at his
262 approach, but the wizard wasn't so lucky.  Thalor's horse kept going, but Thalor leaped from his saddle and landed on the 
263 wizard.  In a tumble of arms, legs, and plate mail, they both went down.  
264     By the time they go up, the fighters had come back.  With the aid of his warhorse, Thalor dispatched them as well as
265 the wizard.  He searched their bodies and found the normal adventuring equipment.  The leader was also carrying a few 
266 items of usefulness. 
267     Soon the caravan caught up and witnessed the remains of the battle.  Angela Jax, the beautiful sister of Garet Jax,
268 commented that it wasn't wise to fuck with a Paladin.  Skrewd the barbarian chuckled grimly and the caravan continued.
269     A few days later, the temple was in sight.  All that was left between them was a small village and the crossing of 
270 river.  When Thalor arrived at the village, he was appalled by the sheer amount of destruction.  Many of the buildings
271 were still burning and skeletons lay all around.  However, the village seemed to be deserted.  He went back to the caravan
272 and reported this.  The continued cautiously.

360 Silvermere gossip 3 (cont)
361     Thalor went back to the caravan and alerted them of the upcoming danger
362 From there, the caravan went slower and more cautiously.  Finally, near nightfall, they arrived at the village.  Buildings
363 re still smoking, but the main road was still clear and so was the bridge.  They decided to make camp and continue in the
364 morning.  Camp was set up on the Silvermere side of the bridge and a watch was made from the mercenaries brought along.
365     Near midnight, a shout arose from a watchman.  Immediately the camp was awake and torches were lit for the humans.
366 Eyes peered toward the town.  Another shout arose as the dark form of an elf was spotted standing on the bridge.  Closer
367 observation determined that the skin was inky black and the hair white as the moon.  All there knew that this was a leg-
368 endary Drow elf, one of the dark ones who had revolted from the light before the
369 wars of darkness.
370     Once again, Thalor took the lead and mounted his horse.  He rode toward the drow and yelled out a somewhat suspicious
371 greeting.
372     "Ho!  Traveller of the night, you are not welcome here.  Pass on your way and you will not be harmed.  This caravan
373 has ne need of your kind."
374     The dark form smiled slightly and replied.  "Paladin, it is you who should be warned.  The cargo you carry is valuable.
375 Don't you think there would be bandits who would want it?"  The smile turned into a grin and the perfectly white teeth
376 shone evilly in the moonlight.
377     Thalor fought down the fear in his stomach at the elf's words.  "That is why we accompany this caravan, to protect it
378 from robbers and bandits.  I warn thee, if you have thoughts of evil, you should abandon them or face the consequences!"
379     The dark elf actually laughed.  "Oh Paladin, you make such a fool of yourself, for all your bravado, you are a weak
380 coward!  I sense the fear in you even though I appear to be alone.  Behold though, and let your fear be greater!  For I 
381 have allies of my own who wish to have the contents of your caravan.  If that means going through you and your pitiful
382 band, then so be it!"  As he spoke these words, many orcs appeared as if from nowhere.  Out of buildings and seemingly,
383 even the ground they came and started to go into tight formation and ranks on the bridge in front of the drow.
384     Thalor turned his horse around and rode back towards camp.  As he arrived, he shouted orders for everyone to prepare
385 for battle.  People scrambled everywhere at once and it took all of Thalor7s military and charismatic skill to organize
386 them into somewhat of a organized fighting force.  he hoped they wouldn't break ranks when the fighting started.
387     The small force consisted of 10 mercenaries (somewhat inexperienced as Thalor had found out recently), 2 clerics of
388 Tyr, an apprentice magic-user sent on this as experience, and an illusionist.
389 The other members of the band were his friends who he had either just met or had known all of his life;  Angela Jax, the
390 fighter who he suspected also possesed some wizardly skills, and who was also a VERY beautiful female gray elf, Skrewd
391 the barbarian, who he had met earlier, Olirin the magic-user, Panthim the fighter, and Kamikaze, a mysterious person whom
392 he had only known for a short while.
393 The small group marched toward the upcoming battle with fear in their stomachs, but nonetheless, kept up their courage.
394     (to be continued)
395   By the way, to the person who didn't know who the columnist was, it is I, the Dark Knight.

402    "That should do it Fellows. Send it on, and remember to duck before the
403 reply from HQ gets here." Parity handed the other agent a piece of hotel
404 stationary on a message was written. Fellows glanced over the piece of paper,
405 and looked up at Parity.
406    "I never thought I'd have to send such a message. We are absolutely sure,
407 aren't we?" As he spoke he removed the COMLINK from his pack.
408    "Five minutes with a body? We both got good looks. There is a chance,
409 but we have both known Ian for some time...."
410    "Yes, we have known him for some time. Here goes" Fellows turned his
411 complete attention to the COMLINK. Net's scientists had really outdone
412 themselves on this device. At half the size of a large metropolitan phone
413 book, the NET COMSET contained the most advanced communications circuits 
414 that existed at the time. The device had a several thousand mile range,
415 needed no external power supply, contained a full keyboard and gas plasma
416 screen not unlike popular portable computers, all on top of high-speed
417 coder mechanism deemed by NET's cryptology experts as a magnitude harder
418 to break than DES.

437 "There, that does it. Look OK, Parity?"
438     "Yes, fine Fellows. Send it on its way and wait for confirmation
439 signal." Fellows pressed a sequence of buttons. The COMSET beeped twice,
440 paused, then a LED next to the display lit. Next to the LED was a tap
441 labeled 'RCVD'.
442      "They have it. Leave the COMSET in instant notify mode?"

497 SILVERMERE GOSSIP 3(CONT.)
498     Thalor designated 4 of the mercenaries, a cleric and the magic-us
499 er to stay with the caravan to make sure that the attack on he bridge was not a diversion.  There was some grumbling, but
500 they obeyed orders.  Thalor couldn't understand why they would WANT to throw themselves into battle, but did his best
501 to try.
502     Thalor organized the group into a small, tight formation and went to the bridge.  The orcs were there waiting.  Thalor
503 wondered why they hadn't already attacked, but was thankful for the reprieve it had given him.  He deployed the mercenaries
504 in the front line as shock troops, his three melee fighters, including himself, in the middle row, his three archers in
505 the back row, and the cleric and illusionist
506 in the far back row.
507     Somehow, as if on signal, the battle began.  Thalor was dismayed as he scanned the enemy formation.  3 units of orcs
508 firing bows were deployed behind two more units of orcs.  The front orcs were probably shock troops, thought Thalor.
509 behind all the orcs stood the drow, grinning.  Quickly, Thalor formed his attack plan.  He shouted his orders and charged
510 at the front troops, trying to break through to the back.  This disrupted the orcs, and he hoped would make himself a 
511 harder target.  The orc archers fired and scores of arrows flew towards the group.  5 of the mercenaries went down, 
512 thrashing and bleeding, and several others of the group were injured.  Thalors charge had a demoralizing effect on the 
513 orcs and he broke through to the archers.  However, he realized he was completely surrounded and knew it was time for
514 heavy melee fighting.  drawing his bastard sword, he hacked and slashed at any orcs who were foolish enough to come near
515 him.  
516      As the archers from the caravan fired, six orcs went down.  Kamikaze charged into the front orcs, but unlike Thalor, 
517 didn't break through.  The remaining people all had oil ready.  Vial after vial was thrown into the midst of the front
518 troops, most missing, but enough hit to drench the orcs.  Then flaming arrows were shot and soon the whole area of the 
519 bridge where the shock troops were was in flaming ruin.  Some orcs made it out alive by diving into the river, but most
520 died in the first blast.
521      Seeing nearly a third of his forces "go up in smoke" (I know...arrgh! :) made the drow furious.  He decided it was
522 time to call upon the aid of wizardry.  He made strange gestures and chantings. A few seconds later, a web stretched from 
523 his fingers.  It flew over the orcs and landed on Skrewd, Angela, and Panthim, actually using them as the anchoring points.
524 He smiled in satisfaction, but frowned as Angela's struggles got her out in less than a minute.
525      Meanwhile, the remaining orc archers were in dire trouble.  Thalor was taking his toll and those who he wasn't near
526 were busy trying to put out the fire.  From the group flew two more vials of oil.  One splattered on an orc, who immediately
527 dived into the river, but the other directly hit the drow.  More flaming arrows were shot and one caught the drow on fire.
528 He writhed in pain, but then recovered as the fire mysteriously went out.  He didn7t have much time to think though, as
529 Angela Jax shot her bow and hit him.  He fell with an arrow sticking in his throat.
530      The remaining orcs, when they saw this scattered and ran.  Efforts were made to stop them, but few were caught.
531      Skrewd examined the drow's equipment and frowned.  With a cry of rage, he shredded the cloak and broke the spiked
532 buckler.  He looked up and grinned.
533      "Don't like magic."  He said simply.  The others grimly agreed, and the illusionist quietly slipped away back to the
534 caravan.  The rest of the orcs had little treasure or anything of use and so they were left.
535      What little distance remained to the temple was small, and no more problems occured.  When they arrived back in S
536 vermere, they reported the village and their story.  Mayor Karan granted them their award, and told them of another ad-
537 venture they might be interested in.
538      "To the North about 200 miles or so, on Mt. Carnage, was some old abandoned caves which drow used to inhabit until
539 about 300 years ago.  Then the dark side came into existence and they abandoned them.  There might still be treasure an
540 items of usefulness there, but it won't be easy I'm sure.  I have a map here which will show you the way to the entrance.
541 If you can find out anything about the drow, it would be greatly appreciated, as they are quite a mysterious race.  Also
542 very dangerous.  Good luck."
543      He handed them a map and they were ushered out of the throne room.

587 "I think we're wasting our time, Farley.  Let's get outta here."
588 Farley was just finishing with "...Afterburner, Eliminator, Tres Hombres..."
589 muttered softly as the final few CDs were examined.  He sighed, and rubbed
590 his eyes which, at the moment, felt like peeled onions.  "Okay, let's go."
591 Once back in the NET vehicle, they saw the COMLINK's "Msg Waiting" LED wink
592 on and off demandingly.  Garret typed in his sequence.
593 Nothing happened.  Farley tried his.
594 A page of scrambled ciphertext scrolled by their eyes.  Before it, all alone on
595 a line, were the letters "RBOTS ECTNT OFRLY".
596 Eugene stared at it for a moment.  "Of course!  'Robot Section to Farley.'
597 Something big's up.  They're not supposed to use this unless they..."  Farley
598 frowned.  "Garret, I'm not sure the RD has NET's permission to send this, not
599 when they sent cipher-within-cipher.  Ever been a stickler for rules?"
600 Farley hoped he knew the answer; James confirmed his hope.  "I follow whenever,
601 and break 'em otherwise.  So what's it say, already?"
602 Farley pulled a small  violet device from his pocket and connected it into
603 the slot in his COMSET made for the purpose.  In a few more moments, the
604 gibberish formed words of meaning...
605 <Farley:  Ian still lives.  One of his androids believes it's Ian and has
606 taken the ROMs.  Only RD, Ian, and
607 Joshua know this, now you.  Droid is extremely dangerous, but will likely not
608 use built-in weaponry as it does not know of its existence when it is 'Ian'.
609 If it becomes aware of its true nature again, all things are possible.  Note it
610 will still use superior strength, information processing, and defense modes
611 that do not require active support by the p-brain (bulletproof, for example).
612 Ian wants it stopped, any means possible.  The RD wishes it to remain intact
613 for study, and hopes you will help.
614 As far as we can discern, the ROMs are still missing.  Parity & Fellows are
615 following some kind of lead in Las Vegas.  Joshua has been dispatched to 
616 neutralize the android.  No other elite agents on this assignment.
617 Lastly: To deactivate the android without destroying, say the words...>
618 "Tall order, Eugene.  If you goof up, though, I'm killing it.  Should be a
619 challenge for once."
620 "Yeah.  Right."  Farley wasn't listening.  He was memorizing the phrase.
621 "So let's go, already.  How far can a heap of junk go, anyway?"
