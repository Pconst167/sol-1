27      WELL, FORREAL, WAS IT YOU THAT ERASED THE LAST 2 LINES OF LUKE'S 
28 MESSAGE ON DISK B?  I KNOW THAT YOU REPLACED WHAT WAS AN EMPTY SECTION,
29 BUT I HESITATE TO ACCUSE.  OH WELL, THE "JERKS" (YOUR PHRASE, NOT MINE)
30 HAVE THEIR PLACE TOO, AS THIS IS A FREE FORM BBS.

32      NEW SUBJECT ANYONE?  HOW ABOUT THE CURRENT INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT
33 SPONSORED CENSORSHIP?  IT SEEMS THAT THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION IS 
34 FRIGHTENED THAT EVERYONE MIGHT KNOW A LITTLE TOO MUCH ABOUT WHAT IS
35 GOING ON IN THE WORLD, SO THEY ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO INTERFERE WITH 
36 THE SPREAD OF INFORMATION OF ALL KINDS.  WHILE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE
37 DESIRE TO KEEP REPORTERS OUT FROM UNDER-FOOT DURING THE GRENADA INVASION,
38 AND THE CORRECT NOTION THAT ADVANCE KNOWLEGE MY THE FORCES ON GRENADA 
39 WOULD INCREASE AMERICAN CASUALTIES, I REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY
40 WEREN'T ALLOWED IN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE INVASION.
41 THE FACT THE AMERICAN PRESS WASN'T PRESENT HAS PLACED THE VERACITY OF 
42 MUCH OF WHAT THE ARMED FORCES HAS CLAIMED TO BE IN DOUBT.  THIS IS
43 REALLY ONLY A MINOR ITEM, BUT IT IS A SMALL DROP IN A LARGE OCEAN OF
44 ADMINISTRATION PARANOIA ABOUT JOURNALISTS.  MOST PRESIDENTS EVENTUALLY
45 FEEL THAT THE PRESS IS "OUT TO GET THEM", MOSTLY DUE TO THE ADVERSARY
46 NATURE OF AMERICAN JOURNALISM.  BUT REAGAN SEEMS TO HAVE GONE A STEP
47 FURTHER INTO FEELING THAT THE ENTIRE FIELD OF JOURNALISM IS MERELY AN
48 INSTRUMENT OF THE KREMLIN.

77    Hmmmmm......
78   The slightest spectre of censorship leaves me with an alltogether
79 sense of forboding.....
80 Regardless of the reasoning applied to its justification .
81 In many circumstances it is only the fear of the press that keeps many
82 of our elected tyrants from abusing their offices more than they already
83 do.  
84 I for one reject entirely the notion of censorship. << ON ANY LEVEL >>
85 If the action or information is not for public consumption  then so be it
86 but should it leak out to the press then       
87          1. It was designed for public effect.
88  or      2. One of our public officials has breached his "responsibility"
89 and should be removed.
90 
92 Anyway... I have regained my perspectiveon "T-D-A"  and although
93 it shocked me I feel now that we should effect a dialogue with USSR
94 to promote a more stable relationship.  Through the need of mutual 
95 interdependence build down to that mythical level of

190 ARE IN REAL TROUBLE! THE ONLY BREATH OF

209      FORREAL, I ASKED IF IT WAS YOU.  NO SLUR WAS INTENDED, OR EVEN
210 IMPLIED, THOUGH I MUST SAY THAT THE ONLY PARTY GUILTY OF A SLUR IS YOU
211 WITH YOUR REFERRENCE TO OTHERS OF A DIFFERENT TEMPERMENT AS "JERKS".
212 I FIND IT EXTREMELY INTERESTING THAT YOU WOULD FEEL SLURRED BY A SIMPLE
213 QUESTION AS TO WHETHER YOU ERASED A MESSAGE, AND YET YOU FEEL FREE TO
214 USE SUCH SLANDEROUS VERBIAGE AGAINST OTHERS.  DO YOU FIND A SIMPLE
215 QUESTION OF ACTIONS OR INTENTIONS TO BE A SLUR, BUT ACTUAL NAME-CALLING
216 NOT?  DOES SUCH A QUESTION CONSTITUTE AN ACCUSATION IN YOUR MIND?  AND
217 IF SO, WHY?  AND IS YOUR OWN ACCUSATION OF WASTE AGAINST THOSE THAT IN-
218 CLUDE AN EXTRA BLANK LINE BETWEEN SUBJECTS, OR AGAINST THOSE THAT ENTER
219 LARGE NUMBERS OF BLANK LINES WITH NO SEEMING PURPOSE?  AS TO WHETHER I
220 AM A LAWYER, THAT IS A QUESTION I REFUSE TO ANSWER BECAUSE IT IS BOTH
221 NON SEQUITUR TO THE ISSUE AND RELATED TO MY PERSONAL LIFE (WHICH I WILL
222 NEVER ANSWER, AS IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS).  REMEMBER, NEITHER YOU
223 NOR I OWN THIS BBS, IT IS THE PROPERTY OF THE SYSOP.  BEING FREE FORM,
224 IT ALLOWS SOME TO ENDULGE IN JUVENILIA, OTHERS TO PONTIFICATE, AND
225 YOU, I, OR ANYONE ELSE TO COMPLAIN.  SHORT OF MIKEY'S RIGHT TO ELIMINATE
226 ANYTHING HE FINDS OFFENSIVE, IT IS ABOUT AS CLOSE TO TRUE FREEDOM OF
227 SPEECH AS I HAVE EVER SEEN.
228      YOU SPEAK OF WASTE.  I USED TO THINK THAT ANYONE THAT DIDN'T USE 
229 MA 128 WAS A WASTER OF SPACE, SINCE SO MUCH MORE COULD BE INCLUDED IF
230 EVERYONE DID.  BUT I FOUND OUT THAT MANY CAN'T RECEIVE PAST MA 80, SO
231 ANY WRITING PAST THAT POINT WAS LOST.  I ALSO FOUND THAT THERE WAS A
232 SMALL BUG THAT CAUSED ALL LINES ENTERED TO THE 128th COLUMN TO BE
233 PRINTED WHEN USING THE FI AND FA COMMANDS.  SO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS WASTE
234 WAS MERELY SOMETHING I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.  WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS
235 THAT, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING, AND WHAT
236 YOU DON'T KNOW MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS RELATING TO A DECISION.
237 ONCE AGAIN, I INTENDED NO SLUR UPON YOUR CHARACTER (AND I STILL FEEL
238 THAT NONE WAS GIVEN), BUT I APOLOGIZE ANYWAY, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PEACE.

295 PAM:
296 PAM: 
297 OMIGOSH!;  Somebody actually asked MY opinion of something.  Well, I can't give you the 'libertarian' opinion of the
298 Grenada invasion, since I don't know what it really is.  However, I will give you my opinion.  It is quite mixed.
299 First, nearly all Central and South American countries are run by either a true dictator, or a very dictatorial one-
300 party system (or a system where one party is very dominant.)  Few of us would feel 'free' in such places.  And when they 
301 invite Cubans in to build a 'civilian' airport, this happens without the true consent of the population.  In fact, even the 
302 president who was killed was Marxist, tho less so that the new guys.  Finally, even Castro himself strongly criticized (at
303 least in public) the killing of that president.  So it could be said that we are freeing the Grenadians from undesired 
304 occupiers.
305 However, remember that the army (Marines, Navy, etc) were financed through taxes (i.e. theft) and therefore are 
306 inherently tainted.  Probably many of the soldiers were in the services because of a tight job market, made tighter because 
307 inefficiencies of unconstitutional government regulation, taxation, etc.  It is estimated that for every job generated by the
308 military, more than one (don't remember the exact figure, about 1.5) jobs are lost in other areas of the economy.
309 And also, it is not the job of America to keep the rest of the world free.  There are too many petty tyrants out there, 
310 like Castro, Khaddafi (how do you spell his name, anyway), Khomeini, Marcos, and others, to try to reform the world, 
311 especially with force of arms.  I am as perturbed with the liberals, fawning over the left-leaning dictators, as I am with 
312 the conservatives, supporting their own favorite regime.  I am glad that Reagan postponed his trip to the Phillipines, giving
313 the finger to Marcos.  We have made too many mistakes by supporting the pro-US leader, only to alienate the non-aligned 
314 populace.  Nicaragua and Iran are only two examples of this type fiasco.
315 So do I support the invasion of Grenada?  Do I oppose it?  Neither.  It is precisely the kind of action I would expect
316 from this government.  Note that I didn't say, 'from Reagan.'  Have you ever heard the word, 'Republocrats.'?  It means
317 Republicans or Democrats.  It doesn't matter who you vote for, you'll get higher taxes, bigger deficits, more spending, less
318 freedom.  Like clockwork.

320 p.s.  You said that many people can't read over 80 columns.  I was under the
321 impression that most terminal programs could read over 80; just a small fraction
322 couldn't.  I can stand ma 80, but I abhor anything smaller.  Perhaps we should
323 take a poll and find out just how many people can't read 80+.

326      The wind sighs among the slender branches of aspen, and ruffles
327 the stream's surface with the gentlest of touch.  It is a dark night
328 but for the ancient creaking lamp hung outside the Inn's back door,
329 and its guttering light reflects only a glint here and there upon the
330 slowly-moving water.  Listen:  its voice is full of mourning and fear,
331 and debris can be seen floating amidst the shifting greys...
332     Inside the Inn, a young girl sparks anger at a grizzled old-timer:
333 "Analog Alan, your eyes must be smattered with rain and the dust of the
334 road to see what you claim of me!  Your comparison was unwarranted, and
335 unjust as well.  Do not think that all relationships are like those 
336 betwix you and your wife--!"
337      With a swirl of rain-bejeweled cloak, she turns away, only to see
338 the Innkeeper once again avoiding her eyes.  The anger drains away, and
339 she lifts a hand in appeal, almost calling out to him.  "I wonder..." 
340 she agonizes, watching him busy himself cleaning up after his guests,
341 "Did he ever receive the unlabeled package sent so long ago, generous
342 with the sinuous profiles of my dragons' shadows?  I entrusted it to
343 the government's messengers--but perhaps they scorned to deliver it?"
344 The Innkeeper whisks off to the kitchen, with a crying, cajoling cat
345 at his heels, and the girl bestirs herself to notice the hour.  When
346 he bustles out moments later and sends a surreptitious glance her way,
347 there is nothing but the raindrops that sprang from her hood when she
348 tossed her wild mane and spoke...

351 Regarding the column question, MA 80 is fine, anything larger or smaller
352 is fine too. I am not picky. My only thought on the subject is that an agreed
353 margin should be useable by all. I would gladly give up greater than 80 
354 characters per line if it meant someone could not read past that. I realize
355 we don't get as much information on a disk with 80 characters as we would with
356 more, but I believe Mikey does a good job of recycling disks(a thanksless
357 job no doubt), and there have been very few times I personally have run out
358 of space(just the other day though). Anyway, lets agree on a margin
359 that everyone can be happy with.
360 
361 Regarding 'The Day After' and the following panel discussion which I thought
362 was more enlightening on the current situation than the movie was : 
363 I think the movie did its purpose in provoking much more dialogue on the
364 subject of
365 nuclear weapons. Most of the people I have talked to at school and work
366 watched Ted Koppel handle national big wigs, and were quite impressed
367 with both him and the people on the panel, except for the jewish philosopher.
368 I agree someone like him should have been there, but I thought he didn't
369 do a very effective job of getting his point of view across. One must wonder
370 if he was invited because he was a philosopher, or because he was jewish,
371 and has lived through one holocoust already. We even got to hear
372 Carl Sagen say 'Billions and Billions'... He
373 Henry Kissenger was his usual self, talking about how he started this
374 dialogue 25 years ago, and how he wrote the book, etc...
375 Enough of this for now. Anyone else have any opinions on the panel? Anyone
376 else care to comment at all? Or is the general concensus that we pick a new
377 discussion?
378 To Jody : How about sometime around noon? Is that OK with you? And we
379 meet initially at the video game place? And on top of all this, I have a 
380 R&R trivia question for you that of you can answer, well let's just say
381 it it tough, but not impossible.

413 HE WOULD NEED BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS !

417 But if Carl Sagan ran for president, how many votes would he get?
418 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
419 
420   I for one would feel greatly relieved if one of such competence was elected
421 Perhaps it is time for a scientist President ??.
422 Someone with an objective greater than his own ambition ?

432 Carl Sagen for president? He is certainly well known enough. He seems to have
433 a great deal of common sense. And being a man of science, we could certainly hop
434 he would use his scientific judgement to make desisions instead of rash
435 emotionalism. But would people vote for him? Would someone like him get any
436 help from the main political parties. Like it or not, I don't think we are
437 ever going to see a president who doesn't fit in the mainstream political
438 mold.
439 Is anyone watching or will be watching the WARGAMES series on ABC? Edwin
440 Muskey as president(it's probably as close as he'll ever come), and several
441 former administration personel in other various roles.

444 turns out good. I will wear brown.        a bien tot

448 I can't tell you how the third world war will be fought, but I can tell you 
449 how the fourth would be. With sticks and stones. 
450 Actually, though I can confidently say there will not be a full scale nu-
451 clear confrontation.
452 By the way d, where've you been? Too busy to come play with my new Commodore
453 toy? Anyhey, I know yours is better, but.........

456 ALL: It sounds like we need an organizer for this party to get organized. 
457 Hayden sounds good to me and "d" agrees. So 
458 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

461 WHERE AM I? GAD, I'VE BEEN SO BUSY OF LATE THAT I MISSED TWO WHOLE DISKS!
462 LUCKILY I CAN GO BACK AND READ THEM. I SEE THAT THE DAY AFTER HAS GENERATED
463 THE EXPECTED RESULTS (SO WHAT?) BE THAT AS IT MAY, I FOUND IT TO BE A BIG
464 BORE. I'VE SEEN MUCH BETTER GRADE 'B' S.F. MOVIES WITH THE SAME PLOT AND
465 STORY LINE. THE ONLY THING THAT MADE THIS MOVIE EVEN NOTICIBLE WAS THE
466 CRY OF FOUL BY THE NUCLEAR PRO AND CON FOLK. MAIN WORRY? THAT THE PEOPLE
467 IN CHARGE OF THIS MESS ARE AS EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE ISSUE AS FALWELL AND 
468 FRIENDS. I'VE HEARD FACTS AND FIGURES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE STREET THAT
469 ARE SO BLOATED AND BLOWN OUT OF SHAPE AS TO BE TOTALY UNRECOGNIZIBLE FROM
470 THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THE DATA (SOME OF IT HAS JUST PLAIN BEEN MADE UP).
471 THE FACT THAT NO ONE IS TREATING THE SUBJECT RATIONALLY (EVEN CARL SAGEN
472 IS USING EMOTIONAL EXCITATION TO 'PROVE' HIS FACTS) IS WHAT FRIGHTENS ME
473 MORE THEN ANY OTHER ASPECT. THE MOST BEFUDLING THING I FIND IS THE CONCEPT
474 THAT WE 'MUST' BUILD MORE AND MORE BOMBS TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING USED, OR
475 PREVENT KADDAFY ET AL FROM MAKING ANY. SAY WHAT?!! WHAT WARPED SENSE OF
476 MIND CONCEIVED THAT THOUGHT? IF KADDAFY WANTS A BOMB HE'LL GET A BOMB,
477 IF ANYTHING THE ENORMOUS VOLUME OF EXISTING BOMBS MAKES IT ALL THAT EASIER TO
478 EASIER TO NICK ONE, OR TO DIG UP THE SPARE PARTS TO MAKE YOUR OWN. ALL IN
479 ALL, I AM VERY UNIMPRESSED. OH YES, IN REGARD TO A PREVIOUS STATEMENT THAT
480 SOMEONE MADE TO THE EFFECT THAT IF YOU SEE THE BLAST, IT'S TOO LATE, THAT
481 IS PURE POPYCOCK. THAT ASPECT OF THE BOMB IS WELL KNOWN AS TO ITS EFFECTS
482 BOTH IN REAL TESTS, AND IN USE. TALK TO SOME OF THE SURVIVORS OF HIROSHIMA
483 OR NAGASAKE. YOU DO A MAJOR DISSERVICE TO THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
484 THIS MADNESS ENDED TO EXAGERATE TO SUCH EXTREMES. FOR IF YOU WOULD
485 EXAGERATE IN THAT, THEY CANNOT HELP BUT WONDER AT WHAT ELSE YOU ARE
486 EXAGERATING AT.  BUT ANYWAY, ON TO OTHER THINGS...
487 d: YES, THE PACKAGE WAS RECEIVED. THANK YOU (BELATED)
488 JODY: THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND WORDS.
489 PAM: HELLO? TRUE, BUT THEN IT IS DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE IN ANY FORM WHEN
490 I AM NO WHERES AROUND TO COMMUNICATE WITH. I HAVE NOT BEEN AROUND MUCH 
491 TO DO MUCH COMMUNICATING WITH BY ANYONE OF LATE. BUSY BUSY BUSY...
492 SO HAPPY TURKEY DAY TO ONE AND ALL!!! (SK??) Snicker..

514 Thoughts on "The Day After":
515 
516 As others have said, the movie was not all that the media led us to 
517 believe.  However, I must point out that the panel discussion was 
518 probably one of the more lucid discussions of the nuclear arms
519 issue that has been delivered before a live audience over a public
520 media source.  I wish that there had been more time for McNamara to talk
521 about his ideas and for discussion of other strategies for disarmament
522 and the easing of world tensions.  Many forget that international
523 relations are a bit like children dealing with each other at the ages
524 of 6-15.  They try to find some kind of identity for themselves in
525 terms of the others around them.  This analogy is simplistic, but the
526 idea is there in the main.  Substitute the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.
527 for a couple of the children and you have the picture.  The problem
528 is that the stakes are much higher than personal identity, pride,
529 or a bloody nose.  Millions of lives and the existence of states hang
530 in the balance.  It is so easy to view international relations in a
531 simplistic way because we have either forgotten the above analogy or
532 have no experience with a world bigger and more complicated than our
533 own small, private worlds of work, family, and personal needs.
534 One reason the Europeans have such a seemingly different view of
535 international relations is that they have had to deal with different
536 cultures, ideas, and political systems in close proximity.  This is
537 not to say that they have been always successful, but they have done
538 fairly well since World War II.  The U.S and the Soviet Union have
539 not faired so well.  The "Bully" syndrome of the little kid applies
540 here especially well.  If you have more power than the people around
541 you, the temptation to exercise it is hard to resist.  That seems to
542 be the way of the world.  As Kissinger said on the panel, our task
543 is to learn how to recognize when either party is under the "power"
544 influence and move back to a position where the problems can be dealt
545 with in a way that is not threatening to the "national ego" of the
546 partys involved.

548                   BACH
549 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
550 
551 Speaking of which, why did Beethoven get rid of all of his chickens?
552 
553 Because they kept saying "Bach, Bach, Bach, Bach......"
554 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
555 WATCHED DAY AFTER TOO BUT DIDNT WATCH THE POLITICAL FRACUS---SEEMS TO ME
556 THAT THE POLITICIANS WHO MAKE THE MANY COMPROMISES AND CHOICES BASED ON
557 THEIR OWNB POLITICAL PRESSURES WERE PROBABLY STILL DOING THE SAME THIONG\
558 AGAIN AND SO WATCHING THEM DISCUSS A PROBLEM LIKE NUCLEAR WAR ON TV IS MORE
559 LIKE WATCHING A SOAP OPERA AND CERTAINLY BY NO MEANS REFLECTS THE REAL 
560 COMPROMISES THAT ALL POLITCIANS HAVE MADE SINCE POLITICIAN CAME IN TO BEING
561 THE TRUTH IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE OF ALL RACES AND NATIONAL GROUPS REALIZE THAT
562 POLITICAL AND RACIAL BARRIERS ONLY CONTINUE THE DIVISIVE NATIONALISM THEN
563 WE AS A HUMAN FAMILY MIGHT BE ON THE TRTACK TO CONTINUING OUR SPECIES.
564 IF ALL HUMAN BEINGS 
565 WERE STRIPPED BARE WITH NEITHER CLOTHING FOOD SHELTER POLITICS RACE DIFFEREN
566 CES OR ANY OF THE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS OF LIFE ME MIGHT UNDERSTAND THAT 
567 MAN IS ONE MAN 
568 SO IN CON                             CONCLUSION IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF
569 SOME ONE BIGGER THAN OURSELVES WERE TO REDUCE THGE HUMAN FAMILY TO THE 
570 PRVIOUSLY MENTIONED STATE OF DRESS ETC. IN ORDER TO TEACH HUMANKIND THE 
571 LESSON THAT WE ARE TRULY ON MANKIND.

574 COME ON, ISN'T ANYONE GOING TO FILL THIS DISK UP BEFORE DRIVE A GETS FULL?
575 **** CYSTOP MIKEY <AHEM> **********************************************
576 
577 A lot of bull about man being stripped naked and realizing "THE TRUTH"
578 isnt quite dealing with reality. The world as it stands is made up of a
579 lot of scared and ignorant people, ourselves included. Let's channel our
580 intellect and energy toward a lower and more realistic goal: tolerant
581 coexistence. 
582 
585 Well be lucky to achieve that!  
586 
587 It's all a matter of communication. As technology increases communication
588 it may also cause communication to outstrip escalation. Buty that's later,
589 son, right?
590 
591 
592 
593 
594 WELL, SINCE NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO FINISH THIS DISK OFF
595 I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO.
596 
597 THIS IS REALY NOT EASY TO JUST COME UP WILL
598 A BUNCH OF JUNK TO PUT OUT HERE WITHOUT ANYTHING
599 OF IMPORTANCE BEING SAID.
600 SINCE THIS DISK WILL SOON BE PUSHED INTO THE ARCHIVES
601 AND NO ONE WILL EVEN SEE THIS.
602 
603 BUT, I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SINCE I WANT TO 
604 ARCHIVE THIS DISK NOW WHILE I'M DOING
605 THE REST OF THE DISKS.
606 
607 TYPICALY I HAVE BEEN RUNNING BACKUPS ONCE A MONTH
608 I USE TO ONLY DO THEM EVERY SIX MONNTHS, 
609 BUT THE INCREASE OF ACTIVITY HERE THIS LAST YEAR
610 HAS CAUSED ME TO HAVE TO DO IT ONCE A MONTH.
611 
612 I NORMALLY MAINTAIN A STOCK OF 10 TO 12 DISK
613 FOR USE WITH BWMS AND WHEN THEY FILL UP
614 I THEN UPLOAD THEM TO AN 8 INCH CPM DISK
615 FOR PERMINATE ACHIVING.
616    
617 THE OLD BWMS DISKS ARE THEN RECYLED 
618 FOR USE ON BWMS AGAIN.
619 
620 BUT ANYWAY, I SEE THAT I STILL HAVE 
621 ABOUT 10 LINES LEFT, AND I AM TRYINNG
622 TO DECIDE WHAT ELSE TO SAY TO
623 FILL THIS THING UP.
624 SO I GUESS I'LL 
625 JUST TYPE 
626 SHORTER AND SHORTER
627 LINES UNTIL IT'S DONE.
628 WELL, THAT ABOUT DOES IT, SO I GUESS I'LL GO ARCHIVE THIS DISK.
