 35  
 36 	OK, I have no problem with belief systems that do not change over
 37 	time (perhaps the believer has found no reason to change them.)

 42 >    To assume a dicotomy (sp), is to assume a defined state of being.
 43  
 44      Yes:  any state of being in which "not true" means "false" and
 45      "not false" means "true."   Perhaps my meaning was not clear in
 46      the quoted material.  I said that only one could be true assuming
 47      that "just a man in the right place at the right time" meant "NOT
 48      the Son of God, but ONLY ..." - which contains the complement of
 49      "the Son of God." I'm not saying that Jesus could not have been
 50      BOTH or NEITHER.  Indeed, if he was the Son of God, it would make
 51      sense that He would be a Man in the right place at the right 
 52      time.  If he was NOT the Son of God, it would make sense that he
 53      was certainly NOT in the right place at the right time (since the
 54      Romans killed him).  But he must either be the Son of God or not.
 55      If you're saying that I must embrace a view which allows for 
 56      something to be BOTH true and false or NEITHER true nor false,
 57      I'm afraid I cannot imagine such states, and will not allow them
 58      in any event.
 59

 63  
 64      I don't deny that I cannot prove that "not true" means "false."
 65      On what am I to base my proof?  You have eliminated one of the
 66      very bases of logic.  Indeed, you may eliminate *all* of them with
 67      the kind of argument you are using here.  You say that I accept
 68      the tenets of logic without question?  I confess!  I do!  I 
 69      know that they are something I have learned - nonetheless I
 70      believe them to be true.  It's all well and good to try to get
 71      around built-up ideas in order to see what they are based on,
 72      but if you take away the basis, you have nothing left!  To 
 73      paraphrase:  "it is good that the window is transparent, because
 74      the landscape beyond it is opaque.  If you see through everything,
 75      then everything is invisible."  
 76  
 77 > So, you really are reduced to "I think, ergo, I Am",
 78 > because your conscienceness implies that you must exist first before
 79 > you can arrive at that conclusion.
 80  
 81      You forget that you are accepting without question a system of
 82      reality in which conciousness implies existance.  Never mind 
 83      that you can't think of another system - you might just not know.  
 84  
 85 > You are left with a multitude of

 88  
 89 	Between what and what?  You have said that the only thing
 90 	hich can be known is that one exists.  Where is the choice
 91 	in that?  To know it or not?
 92  
 93 >  You have to assume ALL views before you can be truely
 94 > correct.
 95  
 96      Then why are you attempting to correct me?  If you assume
 97      my view, why argue?  Indeed, if you believe that everything
 98      other than "I do not exist" is true, what should possess you
 99      to post to a bulletin board?
100  
101 >  Yes, that is all-encompasing and broad, but it's the
102 > only way I'm aware of to compensate for this situation.  Funny
103 > thought: I'm using logic in an attempt to describe itself.
104  
105      Actually, you are using logic to destroy itself.  If you must
106      accept every idea, then you must accept its negation, and if
107      nothing can be determined to be true or false (or even your both
108      or neither), then logic has nothing in which to manifest itself.
109  
110 > Redundant, isn't it?;->)
111  
112      No.  Applying logic to its own basis is not redundant, it is
113      meaningless.  Of course the bases of logic are not *!*logical*!*
114      (i.e. following from ideas previously determined to be true); they
115      are the essence of Logic itself - there is nothing below them.
116  
117 > (swob) "I think that logic is quite robust, actually.  Paradoxes are

122 >  
123 >    Paradoxes ARE logical.
124  
125      By the strict definition, SOME paradoxes are logical in that
126      though they *appear* illogical, they may be shown to be true.
127      The paradoxes I was referring to are those which are *inherently*
128      illogical, such as "this sentence is false."
129  
130 > But the logic system you must be using
131 > seems to be binary.  
132  
133      Indeed, it is.  I know no other.

138  
139      I suppose you can invent your own logical values.  I don't
140      suppose anyone's going to listen to you, though.
141  
142 > Ponder this, and other multi-

145  
146      Views are then never EVER correct in the sense that most every-
147      one understands 'correct.'  Saying 'this is correct' means 'if
148      you happen to subscribe to this logic, then this follows from
149      the axioms.'  Which says nothing meaningful.  You could have 
150      just as easily (wait!  much more easily!) made it a self-
151      evident truth (axiom), and it would carry the same weight.  You
152      could just as easily counter it by making its complement 
153      (complement in my limited, binary sense) a self-evident truth.
154      To hold all views is to hold no view.

176     After cheap highs like glue sniffing and mushroom tripping, the latest way 
177 to catch a buzz is to lick a toad. A University of Michigan expert notes that 
178 Colorado River toads excrete a chemical called bufotenine when agitated. The 
179 Drug Enforcement Agency reports that they have reports of people licking the 
180 chemical from the toads to get high - a felony that can also be fatal.
181     So, girls, before you try to turn that ugly frog into a handsome prince,  
182 remember, no tongue.                                                        
183                       PIERCE NOT SO DETACHED:-8/10/89
184     Embattled former housing chief Samuel Pierce played a strong role in 
185 Republican politics and civil rights, internal HUD documents show. The just 
186 released documents also show Pierce was aggressive about using his clout to 
187 oversee some housing decisions. Documents include personal and professional 
188 letters to the likes of Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
189     A vacant HUD office is this week's hottest Washington, D.C., news-
190 gathering spot. The former quarters of a federal homeless council are the 
191 temporary repository for 48 boxes of files from HUD chief Samuel Pierce's 
192 eight years in office. So far, 47 reporters have dug through the documents, 
193 freed by a New York Times Freedom of Information Act request.
194     Lee Atwater, head of the Republican National Committee, had this comment:
195 "I really don't understand why anyone's upset about what happened at HUD during
196 the Reagan years.  What we Republicans did was no different that what Democrats
197 have done.  The only difference I see, is that the Democrats were actually
198 foolish enough to build some buildings that actually helped the poor and home-
199 less.  Oh, yeah, and each of Republicans were getting six and seven digit
200 payoffs, why those foolish Democrats only took 4 or 5 figure fees.  Let me say
201 on behalf of all good Bush/Reagan Republicans everywhere, that we feel that our
202 actions are the only ways to ensure a Republican majority in the House in this
203 decade.  Let me assure the American voters, that we, as a party, will continue
204 to abuse government at every opportunity for the benefit of the obscenely 
205 wealthy, but only at the expense of the poor and homeless.   Well, okay, maybe
206 the middle-class will suffer some too, but only the lower middle-class, and
207 since you're a Republican, you're not one of those anyway...are you?"

209                         `SOFT LANDING' HERE, FED SAYS:-8/10/89
210     The Federal Reserve's latest report on the economy's health offers strong 
211 evidence that the much talked about "soft landing" is here. In its new beige 
212 book, released Wednesday, the Fed reports that: The nation's economy continues 
213 to grow slowly, with no sign of a recession and inflation remains subdued 
214 across the nation.
215     Of the nine districts reporting on prices or inflation in the Fed's beige 
216 book, eight say inflation is leveling off or slowing. The Boston-based first 
217 district says businesses agree that materials prices have peaked and that 
218 selling prices are rising modestly at most.
219     Manufacturing shows slow growth in several districts and declining 
220 activity in some areas, according to the Fed's beige book. Among those 
221 reporting declines was the eighth district, headquartered in St. Louis.
222     Auto sales are weak in a majority of districts, although Dallas (the 11th 
223 district) reports significantly stronger sales, according to the Fed's beige 
224 book. One reason car sales are up there, economists say, is the 11th district 
225 is rebounding from its energy recession.
226  
227 ECONOMIST FORECASTS RECESSION:
228     Despite indications of a "soft landing," the economy already has entered a 
229 period of severe contraction that will be worsened by persistently high 
230 interest rates, an economic forecasting service warned Wednesday. The nation 
231 shouldn't kid itself by seeing only what it wants to see, said Walter J. 
232 Williams, president of American Business Econometrics, Inc. A recession is 
233 here, he says.

238 electrical generating capacity, estimated at 100 billion watts by the year

245 even as more auto and soft-drink spots are being spliced onto movie tapes, an

257 ......................................................
258    As she touched the goblet to her lips, a shudder passed thru her body.  She
259 had put most of the pieces together, and knew now that she had met this "Friar"
260 before.  She was still not sure who she was, or why she was here, but she also
261 knew that she would answer those questions soon.  The liquid tasted good as she
262 swallowed and looked around.  The others in the room seemed to pay them little
263 heed, altho at one table, in the shadows, lurked another familiar looking 
264 faces.  But, tho they looked so ache-ing-ly familiar, she could not quite 
265 gather their names.   She looked deeply into Friar's eyes and spoke:
266    "We have met before.  Even tho my memory is still less than complete, I am
267 quite certain of that.  From deep in your mind is a fragment of a distant
268 memory.  I feel the images of this place, and of some dealings with you.  Then 
269 one of us leaves and the other follows.  I remember a pool, and some darkness."
270    Friar looked startled.  She couldn't tell if he recognized her or not.  The
271 cast of his eye had definitely changed.  He seemed to lean away from her.
272    "I don't recall if we were enemies or friends, " she continued.  "But we 
273 must put whatever our relationship was, aside.  I have come to try to correct a
274 grevious wrong.  And I'm going to need your help!"                           
275    Before Friar could respond to all this, the lurkers seemed to notice the 
276 lavish spread he had before him.  "Can you get this bag of yours to give us
277 some of this fine food?" the taller one asked.  "We have been travelling for
278 a great distance, and have no money.  The Innkeeper has let us stay in, out of
279 the weather, and occasionally fed us, but we hate to keep imposing on him.  
280 Perhaps we could impose on you a bit, " the shorter one said.  Friar turned
281 back around to check with her, to gauge her reaction to their request.  But the
282 chair in which she had been sitting was empty.                              
283

287                     CONTRA - U.S. LET US DOWN:-8/14/89
288     Contra leader Adolfo Calero, in the wake of a Central American pact to 
289 demobilize his rebels, Sunday said the United States let his forces down. They 
290 could have lobbied harder, they could have shown more support so that the 
291 forces would remain in place until after the elections as the only guarantee 
292 for free elections in Nicaragua, he said.

296                     S&LS STRUGGLE TO MEET STANDARDS:-8/14/89
297     According to an exclusive USA TODAY-Gannett News Service computer study: 
298 520 of the nation's 2,959 savings and loans had no tangible capital on March 
299 31. At least half of those 520 already are targeted to be closed by the 
300 government, and many of the others will need government help to survive. 
301 Another 148 S&Ls have between zero and 1.5 percent tangible capital.
302                                                                              
303                     INFLATION DOWN BUT NOT OUT:-8/14/89
304     Inflation isn't dead but it is down, thanks partly to easing
305  food and energy costs. The latest inflation news came Friday when
306  the Bureau of Labor Statistics said wholesale prices fell 0.4
307  percent in July, from June. More good news is expected this
308  Friday, when BLS will likely say consumer prices rose a scant 0.2
309  percent last month.
310     Most economists agree inflation has topped out for now. Their consensus: 
311 consumer prices will rise at a 4 percent to 4.5 percent annual pace in the 
312 second half. Edward Guay, chief economist at insurers CIGNA Corp., expects the 
313 economy will slow enough to keep consumer prices rising at just a 3.5 percent 
314 annual pace for the next year or so.
315     On Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics said wholesale prices - what 
316 businesses pay for goods and services - fell in July as: Energy costs dropped 
317 3 percent from June, after a 3.1 percent decline in June from May; food prices 
318 rose just 0.1 percent, after June's 0.8 percent fall; excluding food and 
319 energy costs, wholesale prices fell 0.2 percent in July.
320     The overall July decline was the sharpest monthly fall in wholesale prices 
321 since a 0.8 percent drop in July 1986. Inflation has tailed off during the 
322 past two months not only because of a slowing in energy and food price 
323 increases, economists say, but also because of the Federal Reserve Board's 
324 policies.

326 DARMAN TELLS FED TO LOWER RATE:
327     Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, strongly 
328 urged the Federal Reserve to let interest rates drop. Speaking on NBC's "Meet 
329 the Press," Darman told an interviewer it was a fair conclusion that he wanted 
330 rates to fall. He suggested that the Fed had kept too tight a grip on the 
331 money supply for too long.

341 "... he wasn't *really* a man.  He was more like ... like a blancmange."
342 The words echoed within his mind as he remembered his present form and
343 the nearly mindless creatures he was likely to be mistaken for: the 
344 irrational, mischevious, and often deadly *PINK* blancmanges of his own
345 planet, Skyron.  Tales were often told of the renegade blancmanges that
346 transmuted an entire nation over a simple tournament - tales that would 
347 likely be known by the occupants of the building ahead.  They'd probably
348 have sterling, too.  It was definitely best to assume another shape.
349 By the looks of the doorway, most of the beings inside were humanoid.
350 Perhaps he should become a Scotsman.  His body quivered with an inaudible
351 chuckle.  No, his knowledge of Scottish lore was quite limited:  a more
352 nondescript form would do better.  Besides, the woolen kilt always came
353 out itchy and annoyingly short.  
354         Under the moonlight shade of the Rowan tree Swob began to take
355 the form of a man.  As his amorphous body solidified into man-shape, he
356 decided to add some elvish features (just to keep them guessing).  The 
357 night grew cold quickly, and he wondered how humans could stand
358 maintaining such a high body temperature.  He took a half-step toward
359 the building before he realized it.
360         'Clothes!  I'm going to need clothes!'  He thought out his
361 situation.  'What kind of clothing do you suppose they're wearing in
362 there?'  Thinking a peer in the window was imprudent, he took his best 
363 guess at a "medeival" look. 'Let's see: shoes - no boots!  Kinda suedy. 
364 Blue, no grey: charcoal grey boots with those wide-brim tops that fold
365 over.  Umm, pants - kinda heavy-duty, um, light grey - drawstring waist,
366 tucked into the boots.'  He hurried as he felt his power waning.  His 
367 shirt was a loose-fitting pirate-style, though considerably thicker, 
368 also grey.  He thought velour would be nice - too late - he got velour
369 with no fuzz.  He spent most of his remaining power fashioning a heavy
370 woolen vest that hung a little past his waist in front and back, with 
371 a hole in the top for his head - fastened down with a wide belt.  The
372 vest was charcoal as well, but speckled with both lighter and darker
373 points, and sporting in royal-purple a Greek cross that would have looked
374 lke a plus sign except for the widely flared ends.  His remaining
375 energy was only enough for a thin, dark cloak that almost blew away in
376 the night's wind.  He fastened it about his neck with a small clasp 
377 from the pack he normally carried within his body, but now hefted about
378 awkwardly as he adjusted to this unaccustomed shape.
379         "Not even enough for a hat," he muttered as he strode toward the
380 oaken door at the front of the building.  He made haste getting inside
381 and shutting the door behind him, still a bit chilled from his direct 
382 contact with the night air.  He shifted his weight back and forth, trying
383 to find a comfortable stance while he surveyed the interior.  A man 
384 sitting on a barstool caught his attention. 'Isn't that a T-shirt he's 
385 wearing?  and blue jeans?  and aren't those acrylic ...'
386         Socks!  He'd forgotten undergarments again!  No wonder this form
387 seemed even more uncomfortable than usual.  But with his transmuting
388 power well below the "E" it would be some time before he could fashion
389 even these.  'Oh, well, just have to make due, get something to eat.  Hope
390 I remembered to pack some precious metals.'  For whatever other qualities
391 he had, he was a bit absent-minded ...

424                       DEBATE - DONATING ORGANS OF DYING BABIES  USA TODAY'S OPI
425     State laws should allow organ transplants from infants with anencephaly - 
426 a fatal condition in which infants are born virtually without a brain - when 
427 their parents approve. If parents like Baby Gabriel's want to help other 
428 babies live, they should be able to. If we can salvage life from death, then 
429 we must do it.
430  OTHER VIEWS:
431     FERN SCHUMER CHAPMAN, free-lance writer: It will take decades and bold and 
432 sensitive leadership to develop a new moral code to replace the old one which 
433 evolved over centuries. These issues demand a definition of life, of death, 
434 and, at the same time, a delineation of the limit of health care in America.
435     PETER B. GEMMA JR., contributing editor to Conservative Digest: The 
436 gruesome debate over harvesting human organs from dying infants is back. The 
437 timeless and morally inspiring Hippocratic Oath instructs aspiring physicians 
438 to "exercise your art solely for the cure of your patients and give no drug, 
439 perform no operation, for a criminal purpose, even if solicited, far less 
440 suggested."
441     DRS. DONALD MEDEARIS, Massachusetts General Hospital, and LEWIS HOLMES, 
442 Brigham and Women's Hospital: "We believe that the weight of medical evidence 
443 and ethical and practical arguments strongly favor retaining current law."
444     BRENDA WINNER, mother of anencephalic daughter: "We're not saying all 
445 anencephalics should have their organs donated. We're asking that parents have 
446 the choice."
447     DETROIT, Ulysses Newkirk, 45, buyer: "If a child is born and classified as 
448 dead, then that child should not be made to suffer anymore. If God chooses a 
449 child to die, it should die. But it is the parents' responsibility to take 
450 their religious and medical views into perspective and decide whether to 
451 donate the baby's organs."
452     POWELL, TENN., Alice Thompson, 61, retired assistant manager: "I can't see 
453 taking a baby's organs when the baby is not completely dead. I don't feel that 
454 it's right. Parents with a child born like that have enough pain in their 
455 lives without having their babies kept alive artificially just to use their 
456 organs for transplants. ..."

458            INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN TROUBLE:-8/16/89
459     Consumers, corporate executives and lawmakers are blasting insurers for 
460 everything from profiteering to an unseemly attitude of arrogance and 
461 insensitivity, reports the Aug. 21 issue of Business Week. "We're being 
462 besieged. It's a holocaust that's going on," says Robert E. Vagley of the 
463 American Insurance Association.
464     Insurance customers are rebelling, reports Business Week magazine. 
465 Proposition 103 fever is spreading, with up to 10 similar voter initiatives 
466 possible in 1990, and 300 insurance reform bills introduced in state 
467 legislatures. "We've largely ignored and mistreated our customers," concedes 
468 Leslie Cheek III of Crum and Forster Insurance Co.
469     The insurance industry's political clout is crumbling, reports Business 
470 Week magazine. State legislators and insurance commissioners, once in the 
471 industry's pocket, are more independent and even adversarial. "They're (the 
472 insurance industry) losing control of their destiny," says Bruce A. Bunner of 
473 accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick and former California insurance commissioner.
474     Some insurance markets face possible government takeover, reports Business 
475 Week magazine. The auto and health markets have become so dysfuctional, with 
476 millions unable to afford coverage, that these markets are being increasingly 
477 assumed by state and federal agencies. Insurance consultant Barbara J. 
478 Lautzenheiser predicts "a real tendency toward socialization of all insurance."
479     The insurance industry cartel is dying, reports Business Week magazine. 
480 Competition has become vicious. Soft markets in which insurers often lose 
481 money underpricing each other are more protracted while hard markets are 
482 briefer, say industry analysts. Critics are seeking ot abolish insurers' 
483 antitrust immunity, which could make competition even worse.
484     Insurers' financial health is deteriorating, reports Business Week 
485 magazine. "There will almost certainly be a major shakeout, major insolvencies 
486 and financial dislocations," says Robert H. Moore of Alexander and Alexander. 
487 Life insurers also face shrinkage. While they have mostly escaped the image 
488 tarnishing, their profits are under severe, if not irreversable pressure.
489

497  
498 If you think about it it makes sense. Rich people are much more likely to hoard
499 money then poor people. Poor people can't afford to hoard money. So why not
500 give them a chance to atleast see some of the billions of dollars we give
501 to the rich in various subsidies (Defense,HUD etc). Of course the money will
502 all end up in the same hands evenutally.

529 As I was doing so, the door burst open and a man I hadn't seen before, with

553               DEBATE - CALLER ID  USA TODAY'S OPINION:
554     If enough callers want to block the display of their numbers, phone 
555 companies should give them that option, too. Those with call identification 
556 won't have to answer them. That's the power call identification can give us. 
557 It will provide us a remedy for the millions of sick and annoying calls that 
558 now ring into our homes anonymously every year.
559  OTHER VIEWS:
560     DANIEL CLEARFIELD, Pennsylvania's senior assistant consumer advocate: 
561 Caller ID service is an example of the two-edged sword many technological 
562 advances represent. If phone companies want to offer Caller ID, they should be 
563 required to provide a means to block the transmission of a telephone number 
564 when a caller has a need to maintain his or her privacy.

566 Syndicate: This isn't Call Screening. This is Call Revenge. This is Call 
567 Fabulous. Because no one will ever again get through and make you sorry that

570 stands to lose control over unlisted phone numbers."
571     GARY MARX, MIT sociology professor: "Anonymity has positive as well as 
572 negative consequences."
573     JAMES W. CARRIGAN, New Jersey Bell: "The word is out: People now have the 
574 ability to see the phone number of the caller, and many would-be obscene 
575 callers are afraid to mess around on the telephone."

584                   UPS USES NATURAL GAS IN TEST:-8/17/89
585     United Parcel Service and Brooklyn Union Gas Co. began a two-year 
586 alternative-fuel project Wednesday, making UPS the first private 
587 transportation company to use natural gas as a vehicle fuel in New York City. 
588 The city has been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency as having 
589 the nation's second-worst air pollution problem, behind Los Angeles.
590     A two-year alternative-fuel project between United Parcel Service and 
591 Brooklyn Union Gas Co. will involve 10 UPS "package cars" to operate in 
592 Brooklyn, N.Y. A preliminary test on a converted UPS car shows that natural 
593 gas produced 85 percent less carbon monoxide than gasoline and 25 percent less 
594 nitrogen oxide. Mileage was 12 percent better.

596 ARCO SELLS GAS REPLACEMENT:
597     ARCO will introduce a replacement for leaded gasoline next month in 
598 Southern California that could reduce smog from older vehicles by up to 20 
599 percent, company officials said Tuesday. ARCO will stop selling regular leaded 
600 fuel and start selling the new gasoline, called EC-1, on Sept. 1. The new gas 
601 will be sold to dealers at the same price as leaded gas.
602     ARCO's new leaded-gasoline replacement being introduced in Southern 
603 California is called EC-1, an acronym for emission control. It uses a methanol 
604 derivative called methyl tertiary butyl ether, MTBE, to boost its octane. MTBE 
605 adds oxygen to the gasoline, creates a leaner fuel mixture and leads to fewer 
606 emissions. It also contains 50 percent less benzene, a cancer-causing additive.
607 FUEL CONSERVATION BEST:-8/17/89
608     Investing in conservation yields a greater economic return than switching 
609 fuels, says a report Wednesday by the Consumer Energy Council of America 
610 Research Foundation. The report compares 24 different energy investments to 
611 putting money in the bank. Copies can be obtained for $1.50 each by sending a 
612 check or money order to CECA/RF, 2000 L St. N.W., Suite 802, Washington, D.C. 
613 20036.
614     A report Wednesday by the Consumer Energy Council of America Research 
615 Foundation that compares conservation to switching fuels finds that: 
616 conservation investments pay between three and eight times as much as putting 
617 money in the bank; fuel switching might yield losses or at most meager 
618 returns; if a new furnace or boiler is needed, low-efficiency equipment is a 
619 terrible investment.
620 IMPORTS SUPPLY OVER HALF DEMAND:-8/17/89
621     For the first time in a dozen years, imported oil supplied more than half 
622 the U.S. petroleum demand in July, according to the American Petroleum 
623 Institute. Reason: slowed production from Alaska's aging fields. API reported 
624 total imports of crude oil and refined products averaged 8.5 million barrels a 
625 day, or 50.4 percent of U.S. deliveries.
626     Imports declined in the early 1980s as production from Alaska oilfields 
627 grew and were only 31.5 percent of total usage in 1985, when they averaged 4.9 
628 million barrels a day. The American Petroleum Institute says the highest year-

642 "Brass monkeys????"  Swob wondered to himself, "whatever possessed me to 
643 say that?"  Perhaps his recent concern over alloys and similar, non-rational
644 beings had manifested themselves in this human form, just as his need for 
645 sustenance had become a swirling, warm sensation in his belly.  The sen-
646 sation became deeper and more widespread as he considered the possibility
647 that he had picked up personality traits of former inhabitants while 
648 transmuting  under the Rowan tree.  This place was full of magick (at least
649 tonight), and that was scary enough without strange phrases erupting from
650 his mind.
651      The place was bustling with activity.  The woman he'd seen leave the
652 building earlier (had she seen him?) was soon followed by a man who looked
653 like a monk, though certainly not Orthodox.  Imagining what he would look 
654 like through blancmange eyes, he knew he had seen him before.  He turned 
655 and smiled in a gesture of friendship, but the man was already out the door.  
656      And who was that girl who'd surprised him out by the tree?  Quietest 
657 stalker he'd ever not heard.  Bad enough to forget clothing, even worse 
658 that someone had *seen* him - a female no less.  He wasn't sure how much
659 of his present colour was due to cold, and how much to embarassment.  He'd
660 tipped the hat he didn't have, taken a long bow and started toward the door.
661 It wasn't polite to speak first in the presence of royalty...
662  
663 (It wasn't polite to leave either, but in his embarassment and chill he
664                              forgot this)

724      The Cloaked Man had not moved since his escapade with the beggar some time
725 before.  Already, the dawning of the Second Triad had occurred, and the Stone
726 Triangle bore silent witness to the coming and going of another segment in the
727 neverending cycle of Pyrrix Aaal.
728      Quietly, the Cloaked Man stared up at the Triangle, as if cataloging each
729 crack, each impurity that ran along the marble.  His eyes moved along almost 
730 randomly, searching the stone for some  missing element that seemed to hide 
731 from his gaze.
732       Then, at the exact moment when the second moon passed behind the Triangle
733 of Stone, his eyes flashed a gleam of   understandin.  Hurriedly, with hands
734 almost quivering with what might have   been a mixture of excitement and fear,
735 he fumbled about in a large pocket on   the inside of his cloak, and brought
736 forth two small devices.  The first, a  gleaming rod of golden metal, he 
737 twisted in his hands, until the larger  end, at the top, extended outwards on a
738 smaller rod of glass.  Within the blown, twisting structure, tiny beads of 
739 light swirled and swayed, darting up and down the length of the rod with a 
740 rhythmic, pulsating heartbeat that was  almost hypnotic in its intensity.
741      "Ah." the metallic voice whispered, a hint of satisfactiontingingits
742 somber tone.  "Perfect..  He's left the Inn...  AND the field."  He twisted a
743 small circlet of glass set into the  base of the rod.  "Probability is stable, 
744 line is established."
745      His thin fingers danced over a small set of four buttons, and the air was
746 filled with a burning smell, like rubber and asphalt.  A crackling hum 
747 resounded from the surface of the Stone Triangle, and a green cloud began to
748 swirl around the being of the Cloaked Man.
749      "It begins, and ends." he muttered, and his dry voice drifted through the
750 eternal night of the Networks.
751  
752  
753      Outside the Inn, a somewhat stout  individual approached a country road,
754 as if searching for something on the    gray horizon.  His eyes, lost in their
755 ponderings, failed to notice a billowing thunderhead in the distance growing
756 closer, as if pulled by unseen strings  across the distant ocean, until the 
757 cloud was almost directly overhead.
758      With a sound and scent of cannon   fire, a wid of  tremendous force 
759 whipped against the helpless being, who stepped backwards, attempting to gain
760 his bearings enough to retreat back to  the Inn.
761      bBefore he could, however, a thin   ray of golden light erupted from tthe
762 base of the cloud, slinking downwards   to the ground, where it scorched the 
763 moss that covered the thin, rounded stones that covered the walkway that led
764 to the large brick building in the near distance.
765      Just as before, the Cloaked Man rode the light to the ground, where a wave
766 of his hand abruptly stopped the winds and distant thunder.
767      "Friar..." he muttered, his voice one of ashes and decay, just as it had
768 been when he whispered those words in the filthy alleyway where he had arrived
769 on this world.
770      "For crimes against my world," he  said, easing a small, nearly invisible
771 line of inky blackness from his other hand.  "I am to Judge, to Carry Out, and
772 to Execute."

899      As Heinlein once said (More or less, and through one of his characters.)
900 'Philosophers never let facts get in the way of the truth.' A good 
901 philosopher is meerly an historian of philosophy. The fact that he or she
902 can regurgitate things said in the past does not impress me. The difference
903 between Philosophy and Sophistry is really just about nil from the point of
904 view of the reciever fo `enlightenment'. The only difference is in the 
905 motivation.
906  
907      All this means to me is that one man/womans opinion is as valuable as
908 anothers. Quoting Hume, Socrates or Dworkin to support ones point of view is
909 no different in reality then quoting anybody else talking about life and
910 its meaning. 
911  
912      Deeper meaning often just means that you are a deeper fool.

926      Hate to tell you this, but multivalued logic systems have been around 
927 for a long time. They no more destroy the basis of logic, than using a base
928 other than 10 destroys the basis of arithmetic. 
929 	Also "This sentence is false" is not a paradox in *any* logic system!
930 There's usually a chapter on this sor of thing in any good book on symbolic 
931 logic. The only way it looks like a paradox is if you confuse the langauge
932 and the meta-language. If that doesn't mean anything, get a book on logic.

952 think they are great. I mean jeez, I get on this system to read stories and
953 debates, and instead I get rehashed stuff from USA Today! Why wouldn't I be
954 thrilled? I really think they are great! Once you really put your mind to it,
955 you too can convince that reading something that one person wrote and then
956 another person transcribes here is much better than reading original thoughts,
957 comments, stories, and so forth.
958  
959 What would you rather read anyway? A nifty multiple authored story written by
960 a bunch of interesting people having a good old time, or thrown-up news
961 uploaded by someone who obviously just doesn't care?
962  
963 I know what my vote is.

978 Sorry, no story entry today.  Job interview for new position with the company.
979 Department Manager.  Oooooh.  I'm soooooo impressed.  I know, but it does 
980 mean an extra $200 or so a month as a token raise, and with spouse out of
981 work for the baby, every little bit helps.
982 Will continue Wednesday or so.
