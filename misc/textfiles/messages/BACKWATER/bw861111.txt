37 "Let me see your papers,"
38 "Of course,"
39  
40 Lipton spoke with the accent and disposition of a Canadian. With a deliberate
41 trace of French pronunciation in each of his words. If it were another
42 European nation, he would almost surely have been taken as a tourist from
43 France. Not so. These were Warsaw Pact soldiers. Part of a single Iron State
44 for over four decades. So, not used to listening to accents in the style of
45 Quebec.
46  
47 He handed his slips of paper over to the guards.
48 While he waited for the lieutenant in the gray uniform to inspect the papers,
49 he observed the red epaulets, and the details of the rifles. Each soldiers
50 breath matched the static pattern on their overcoats. Each of their feet were
51 restless and their hands were rubbed together in a vain attempt to change the
52 Winter on the stone paved streets of Prague.
53  
54 White knuckles on the hands that held the papers up for inspection showed that
55 the cold was effecting them. Duty required that he see these. Desire to
56 perform that duty kept the hands out in the Winter winds.
57  
58 "In order. Stay off the streets tonight sir, it is too cold,"
59 Words spilled out from the rattling teeth of the lieutenant. His humor was
60 appreciated by Lipton, who gathered up his nerve and laughed with the soldiers
61 at the irony of the joke. Martial law had been in effect in Prague since the
62 Finnish Incursion.
63  
64 Eventually he walked off into the night. Leaving the soldiers at a burning
65 stack of wood and newspapers in drum. That night, Lipton saw to the renting of
66 an office in the upper stories of a deserted warehouse. Near the Secretariat
67 building and his flat. It was a month and a large number of empty days and
68 nights before his training would be used.

75 	Turing Test Number 2 (words: Bob Kanefsky, music: "Lola" by the Kinks)
76 I met her playing chess at the AI lab,
77 Where the corn chips taste like they're circuits dipped in Mazola.
78 And foo bar bazola.
79 She sent me some MAIL, and she asked me to TALK.
80 I asked her her name and in a dark brown she typed "Mola".
81 Ey-el-ey-en-ola. AI Motorola.
82 
83 Well, I'm not the world's most intelligent guy,
84 But she beat me at chess without seeming to try.
85 Oh, my Mola. AI Motorola.
86 Well, I'm not dumb, but I just don't know
87 Why she typed so fast and she thought so slow.
88 Oh, my Mola. AI Motorola. AI Motorola.
89 
90 Well, we ate corn chips and stayed up late,
91 Locked in electric tete-a-tete.
92 She talked of love and wrote some poetry,
93 And said, "Dear boy, won't you come visit me?"
94 Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy,
95 But when I read her poems, I completely fell for my Mola,
96 AI Motorola. AI Motorola.
97 Mola! AI Motorola. AI Motorola.
98 
99 	I walked to her room.
100 	I opened the door.
101 	I fell to the floor.
102 	I climbed up the ramp.
103 	And I blinked at her and she at me.
104 
105 And that's the way that I want it to stay,
106 And I always want it to be that way for my Mola.
107 AI Motorola.
108 Real will be fake, and fake will be real;
109 It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up field, except for Mola.
110 AI Motorola.
111 
112 Well, I left home just a week before,
113 And I never ever wrote a program before.
114 But Mola winked and took me by surprise
115 And said "Dear boy, you should see your eyes!"
116 Well, I'm not far down the hacker's road
117 But Im stuck in the mode, and I'm proud of my code.
118 And so is Mola.
119 AI Motorola. AI Motorola.
120 Mola! AI Motorola. AI Motorola.
121 Mola! AI Motorola. AI Motorola.
122 Mola! AI Motorola. AI Motorola.

124 	Hmmm, still  a bit rough there, thought Bard. He was about to run 
125 through it again when the autopilot beeped.
126 	At last! Inisfall...
127 later...
128 	He watched the rock face slide back into place over the cave entrance
129 before starting down the trail to the Inn. He'd be there in a couple of
130 hours.

138      Sister marianne looked through the observation window down upon the child.
139 After she had realized he was still alive, she sped him to the nearest hospital
140 Now it looked as if the child would survive with no permanant damage.
141 
142      The doctor appeared beside her.
143      "since there are no parents, I suggest you take custody of the boy.  I
144 believe your church has an adoption program, does it not??" he asked.
145      "yes" she replied "that is what I will do.  This child has suffered to
146 much"
147 
148      during the next two weeks the baby recieved more attention than it had
149 known. Food, warmth and a loving pair of hands.  The child was given a name
150 which was, Tobias, and was also given a birth certificate(of unknown parents)
151 He was entered in the churches adoption program so some lucky infertile 
152 couple could have a child.

172   Something about a path calls to us, says in a language deeper than words,
173 "Come, travel me.  Together we shall wend into unknown byways, explore
174 the delights that lie just beyond your eyesight.  Come."  The path at the
175 piper's feet called and something deep within him answered, as always,
176 "I am coming."  
177   For the first mile or so, he gave himself up to the sheer joy of walking
178 over unknown |errain.  The path wound up the small, treeless hill, turning
179 between stones and bushes through air spiced with the summer greeness that
180 the sun distills into a quiet afternoon.  He spared little attention to
181 the vista surrounding him, noticing only as he crested the small hill and
182 began to descend into the succeeding valley that he seemed to be walking
183 across a vast moor.  The vegitation had a familiar look to it, the soothing
184 feel of something that fit, something that did not attract your attention.
185   The path was smooth, ghanging from earth to fine gravel and sometimes
186 sand as he walked along.  It seemed to be well maintained, for he never
187 threatened to turn his foot on a rock or twist his ankle in a washed
188 portion of the path.  He had fallen into the rythm of a long-distance
189 walker, his muscles warm, relaxing fully when not exerting force, feeling
190 as though the surrounding country were drawing him into it through a
191 psychic peristaltic action, absorbing him into its very structure.
192   After some hours (or at least it seemed like hours -- time seemed
193 somehow suspended in this place) his trained eyes began to look for a
194 campsite.  After rejecting several, he found himself in a wmall valley.
195 Near, but not to near, a small stream he found shelter on ground that
196 would not be transformed into a creek by the runoff of an unexpected
197 storm.  Sheltered from night breezes, firewood from the scrub brush all
198 around, it seemed near perfect.
199   Setting up his camp was easy.  WIth no equipment, only gathering
200 firewood and preparing a fireplace is necessary.  From his sporran, he
201 took out dried meat and bread and made a scanty meal washed down with
202 water from the nearby brook.  Then, wrapped in his plaid, he kindled a
203 small fire, more for symbol than warmth, and leaned back against a uder
204 still warm from the sun.
205   He was nearly ready to fall asleep when a small rustle in the underbrush
206 brough him back to alertness.  It was the sound of something small, not
207 the crushing sound of a large animal, but the more sibilant rustle of a
208 small creature.  Twilight had deepened into night when into the circle of
209 firelight came a small cat pulling what seemed to be an enourmous white
210 feather.

221 Prague
222 March 21
223  
224 "Chairman, it is about a Canadian,"
225 Sokorsky spent his time dealing with foreigners. Not as a diplomat, or a
226 pilot, or even as a steward. As the Minister of Domestic Security. A job that
227 required that he deal with foreigners without their knowing of his
228 involvement. Policing their activities with thorough inspection and deliberate
229 disregard for their privacy.
230  
231 In Prague and at that time of year, he got enough practice to become nearly
232 perfect at his job. Warsaw Pact armies were practicing their ability to
233 penetrate the national defenses of a European nation should war ever come. It
234 was his primary duty to prevent foreign spies from learning about the event.
235  
236 Any more learning than they would with the services of reconnaissance flights
237 or orbital cameras. Which would be little, since the manoeuvres were taking
238 place under cover of rainy nights, and dense treetops.
239  
240 "What about this Canadian?"
241 "He is a doctor. One who studies insects, butterflies in particular. His
242 letters talk of his recent trips into the forests. If his story is to be
243 believed, they are a great profit to his knowledge of our forests insect life.
244 I doubt him though,"
245  
246 "Why? Is he photographing the manoeuvres?"
247 "No, he does not. Not photographs. He only catches butterflies and puts them
248 to death inside a jar. After he catches three or four, he takes them to his
249 office and sketches them on paper,"
250  
251 "How did you learn this?"
252 "I have had units from the manoeuvres watch him on their way to other
253 positions. He is never is the wrong places. He never watches the wrong things.
254 From searching his office and flat, we have found that he keeps no records or
255 even a radio,"
256  
257 "So, why is he a spy?"
258 "It is an impression I have of him, sir. He is perfect. It is as though it was
259 all a pretense,"
260  
261 "Have him watched, as I am sure you are, Sokorsky. You are doing a fine job.
262 Is that all for this meeting?"
263 The Ministers all nodded and gathered together their papers. The meeting was
264 closed with the strike of a gavel. And Sokorsky was left to his own
265 suspicions and a distressing lack of proof against Lipton.

270   The piper felt a shock stiffen his body.  That feather!  Nearly three
271 feet long, gleaming white, with several long hairs growing out of the
272 quill -- no!  He moved swiftly, snatching the feather from the small cat,
273 holding it to his nose, inhaling the half-forgotten scent -- sweet
274 grasses, blue summer skies, and a faint hint of a passing thunderstorm.
275   Tears filled his eyes and the pain of a half-forgotten loss beat him to
276 his knees clutching the single feather to his chest.  Some wounds heal.
277 Some wounds never heal, they simply loose their immediate signifigance,
278 hidden behind recent experience, blurred by the pass of time, waiting with
279 all their malevolence to cripple one who has tried to ignore their
280 existence.  The piper felt a tearing, as though an emotional scab had
281 been torn from a wound that had finally began to heal.
282   How long he spent on his knees, he did not know.  He looked around
283 himself at last -- no longer along the banks of a small stream, he was
284 back in the somber forest clearing looking at the scarce disturbed ashes
285 of his long dead campfire.  There was no sign of the glowing sphere in the
286 sparse light of the cold pre-dawn morning.  Light mists moistened his
287 cheeks diluting the salt that was there.  He shook his head, denying the
288 pain he still felt.  Peg was gone.  It was over.  Finished.  Somehow the
289 night's experience must be forgotten.
290   He moved stiffly to the ashes of the fire.  There could be a lingering
291 coal that could be coaxed into warmth -- there!  A few twigs, a bit of dry
292 moss, then a small flame began to lighten the cold pre-dawn clearing and
293 warm numb fingers.  He was crouched near the fire when, with a slight mew,
294 the small cat stalked into the circle of firelight.  Unafraid, as though
295 greeting an old friend, the small cat walked directly to the piper, placed
296 her front paws on his leg, looked up at him an meowed demandingly.
297   Nonplussed, the piper stared back into her eyes.  She must be young --
298 perhaps six months old, for the gold of her eyes still held some of the
299 blue haze of kittenhood.  Her smooth, tawny coat was unmarked, glowing with
300 a rich red undercolor, its brown shading nearly to black along her back
301 and tail.  The small cat nuzzled his hand an impatiently mewed again,
302 searching, as though for the feather he had taken from her.

408    "mom" Tobias yelled down from his room.
409    "Yes Toby" Mrs. Hemmington answered in her best "caring mother voice.
410    "Im not going to school today. I feel sick."
411    "OK, honey, Im going to work now, you get plenty of rest."
412     That's how it had always been, a domineering son, a weak mother and a father that avoided them both.  Only two things 
413 seemed unusual about Tobias until his fifteenth birthday, these were his attraction towards violence and rebellion, and his
414 liking for the taste of blood. On his fifteenth birthday, a year ago, he had a dream, or rather , a nightmare................

472    He was sure he heard it this time. But so faint. Was it only in his mind?
473 Yes. There it was again. Music. Melody unlike anything heard at the Inn for a
474 long time. A chorus. Rousing, uplifting. Songs of distant places and other
475 people. Harmony. Cragmore's fingers tapped on the hard wood table. Rhythm. He
476 knew the song. As his memory of the song grew, his tapping began to match the
477 rhythm in his mind, instead of following. Cragmore knew of only one person
478 in all the realities who could play music on both physical and spiritual
479 planes. Bard was close!
480    Cragmore pushed back his hand-carved wooden chair and stood. Dizziness
481 flooded his head and he wavered. Inactivity and drink had taken their toll
482 on the psionic-specialist. He steadied himself against the table. His head
483 cleared. The music in his mind grew. A quick psi-cleanse and Cragmore felt
484 ready. He strode to the oaken door of the Inn, preparing to meet his friend.

488      I'm interested in picking up interesting programs for IBM 
489 compatable computers.  I like to talk to any interested hackers
490 who can help me with my lust for acquiring software. Please help the
491 poor broke software fiend!! Let's talk about it over the phone, 
492 my number is 224-0150 and my name is WOLFGANG......Remember as Kipling
493 once wrote "Four things greater than all else Women and Horses and 
494 Power and War.

496 ============================================================================
497   
498 I am glad to see that Backwater is in as good a form as ever after a couple
499 years absence.  Piper, Bard, Milchar, all of you seem to be here. I will have
500 to check in a couple more times before I must go again. At least the Air Focerce
501 had the decency to assign me just outside of Cambridge, England.
502 
503 ====================================================Evan (or The Traveller )==
504 PS- I see that someone else has begun using the same name, use it well.
505 ===============================================================================
506 PPS- Mike, enter only does get rather annoying! Not being able to fix one's 
507 own mistakes is a problem.

509 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
510 Traveller (Evan): Welcome back.
511 ++++++++++++
512 "Now that you've persuaded me to come here, Milchar, what are we going to do
513 now?" inquired the gnome.
514 "Patience.  A lesson in patience is always well worth the effort; pity you
515 seem to have avoided it during your studies.  No matter.  You won't have long
516 to wait, Grann.  I'm looking for a familiar face, someone to exchange stories
517 with.  And who knows?  Maybe get together and play starring roles in a new
518 saga.  Have I not told you, Grann?  Things *happen* here in Innisfall."
519 "Knock off the 'venerable wizard' talk- it doesn't become you.  Do you see
520 anyone you know?"
521 "Quiet, apprentice, or it's one thousand times 'I will not sass my master' on
522 the blackboard in Sanskrit.  And no, no one yet."
523 The conversation continued approximately in this manner for some time; Milchar
524 sat with the gnome at his favorite corner table in the commons area of the Inn.
525 The babble of voices was steady, with a brief burst of laughter punctuating
526 the noise.  Cragmore appeared from the stairs leading to the private rooms
527 above, only to disappear through the front door before Milchar could hail him.
528 "Well, Grann, demonstrate your newest lesson.  Search for psi-powers,
529 impressions, and auras.  Tell me what you sense."
530 Grann closed his eyes (not entirely necessary, but it aided his concentration)
531 and probed the surroundings briefly.  As a check, Milchar also extended his
532 awareness to what he believed Grann could manage.  Unlike Grann, he did this
533 with eyes open, still scanning the room, and while quaffing a bit more of the
534 Inn's fine ale.  After all, he had had several decades more practice.
535 "The man who just exited from the front door I sense.  Your probe, too.  Uh,
536 lots of impressions here, I can't sort them out.  And... that's funny.  A
537 wierd aura outside, somewhere."
538 Milchar grew interested.  "Direction?"
539 "South and east."
540 A much more intense probe now, streching out to encompass its target, enfolding
541 it, feeling it.  And withdrawn as quickly as it began.
542 "That is the micro-pile of a technological ship.  Who...?"
543 "You're asking me?  I don't know nothing, I'm just the apprentice here."
544 "...one person I know of that comes from a technologically advanced planar
545 stratum, and visits here regularly- discounting the Doctor, of course, as
546 Timelords don't use micro-piles: Bard is here.  Should we go to...nope,
547 Cragmore probably has gone to do just that.  Find something to amuse yourself
548 for awhile, Grann- I'll wait here so I can speak with some old friends."

558 Oh death,  sweet death, relieve me of this burden I can no longer 
559 bear.   Take me into your arms,  I willingly go.   In my youth  I 
560 wished to live forever, never to face the certainty of mortality. 
561 But  now in these later years of my life I find no reason to fear 
562 that  which must come.   So why not take me now?   Spare  me  the 
563 agony of what is left of this life.   Spare those around me of my 
564 pain.   Take me while I have the dignity to stand on my own.  Let 
565 me  be remembered in my strength,  not in my weakness.   Those  I 
566 knew  have left one by one.   There is little left to enjoy.   No 
567 comrades to call,  no friends to see.  Days spent staring out the 
568 window,  thinking  of  times past.   All that I was,  all that  I 
569 wanted to be.   Now I sit and watch life go on without  me.   The 
570 world  goes  on  without me.   So take me sweet  death,  take  me 
571 quickly.  Let me not suffer those long painful years.  Let me not 
572 ruin the lifes of those who must care.  Leave me my dignity it is 
573 all I have left. Take me quickly sweet death.            - Anon -
