25 JEEZUS!! I CAN'T STAND IT!! SAN ! ANOTHER BLANK DISK STARING AT US.
26 IN REFERENCE TO THE THANKFULNES& ON THE OTHER SIDE, I'LL HAVE TO AGREE WITH 'DOM'. GOD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT EXCEPT
27 BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THOSE DEAD AND CRIPPLED MEN THAT HAVE FOUGHT OUR 'HOLY' WARS IN THE PAST. AFTER ALL IF IT WASN'T FOR R
28 RELIGIEION WE WOULDNT HAVE ANY WARS! JUST LOOK BACK IN HISTORY!
29 THE BLOODY CRUSADES, CHRISTIANITY AGAINST ISLAM ETC.
30 WW II, HITLER AGAINST THE JEWS
31 VIETNAM, CHRISTIANS AGAINST ATHIESTS (REDS)
32 LEBANON, JEWS & CHRISTIANS AGAINST THE MOSLEMS ETC.
33 SAN SALVADORE, ANOTHER VIETNAM.
34 IF ONLY WE COULD GET RID OF ALL THE BIBLE THUMPING BIGOTS IN THIS WORLD IT MIGHT BE A HALF-WAY DECENT PLACE TO LIVE.
35 WHEN I THINK OF ALL THE BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SPILLED IN THE NAME OF SOME STUPID FIGMENT OF THE IMAGINATION (GOD) AND ALL THE M
36 MONEY SPENT IN THE SAME WAY, IT'S NO WONDER WE HAVE SUCH HIGH TAXES. IF ALL THE CHURCHES PAID THERE OWN WAY, IE; TAXES;MX MI
37 MIS&SSELS; TRIDENT SUBMARINESS; ETC. WE WOULDN'T NEED TRILLION DOLLAR DEFENSE BUDGETS!

39 CYM: You had better re-check your history. There have been wars
40 in which religion played very little part. I suspect that while
41 removing the "bible-thumpers" (of ALL faiths) would improve things
42 greatly, we would still have LOTS of trouble. (by the way, Marxism
43 as practiced in most communist countries, bears a marked resemblance
44 to a revealed religion!)

46 BAD: I hate to tell you this, but after puberty there are only
47 two effects from castration. 1. You are no longer fertile.
48 2. You may have PSYCHOLOGICAL problems (impotence etc).
49 You see, the Adrenal glands will still supply an adequate amount
50 of testosterone. It may reduce the level, but for that Depo Provira
51 is a much simpler (& less final) solution. I don't recall saying
52 much about "easy" solutions, except perhaps that they usually wind
53 up being more trouble than the original problem.
54 
55 DOM: I hate to say this, but I GOOFED! I really wanted the square
56 root of MINUS i (-i). Somehow, I forgot BOTH "-" signs. Sigh....
57 
58 I once heard a "unique" solution to the drug problem suggested:
59 Remove ALL restrictions on the sale & use of drugs by ADULTS. 
60 In a few generations, natural selection will have taken care of
61 the problem. Anyone dumb enough to misuse drugs, or to use them
62 improperly (antibiotics, painkillers, without knowing what they
63 are doing) will eliminate themselves from the gene pool. 
64 I didn't say I AGREE with this, but it IS an "interesting" point
65 of view!

68 I'm not a very religious person, but I think if you examine history carefully;
69 you'll find that most wars are based on economics rather than religion.  This
70 includes Viet Nam, WWI & WWII.  A prime example would be the U.S. Civil War.
71 On the face, it seemed to have been fought over slavery; but the real factors
72 are economic.  An agrarian South vs. a industrial North...northern control of
73 the legislature, thus the enactment of laws and tarrifs to benefit industry and
74 hamstring southern agriculture.

160 Oh, C.Y.M:  I think you are about to receive a particularly scathing message

165   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>   23:23   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
166      So, so wrong, Dave...though it is good to hear the chuckle in your
167 voice, and I can just picture you sitting back with bright, dancing
168 eyes, ready for the wild fight you think is coming...
169      
Aaron, long-lost traveler!  How wonderful to finally hear your
170 exuberant greeting above the hubbub; and how astonished was I at the
171 warmness of your tone...religion, a 'middle ground' say you?!  Ach,
172 Aaron, you chose the wildest controversy of them all--!  But I will
173 not shrink back from this controversy, for the Bible happens to be one
174 of the few subjects I know thoroughly.  (It happens to have a great
175 deal to say about Life, the Universe, and Everything, not just sad
176 tales of heros, or flourished poetry about shepherds...)
177 

     Religion (as a whole--both Christian and pagan) happens to be
178 described in the Bible as a despicable prostitute, entirely unfit to
179 represent God, as follows:  "Come, I will show you the judgment upon
180 the great harlot who sits on many waters, with whom the kings of the
181 earth [governments of today] committed fornication, whereas those who
182 inhabit the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication...
183 upon her forehead was written a name, a mystery: 'Babylon the Great,
184 the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.'
185 And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones
186 and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus."  

So you, CYM, are quite
187 justified in condemning the hypocrisy of religion that claims to teach
188 peace and yet is the cause of so much anguish via so-called 'just wars'!
189 

Nevertheless, God is not watching this scenario benignly; in fact,
190 The angry sentiment you expressed regarding these hypocrites; i.e. "if
191 only we could get rid of all the Bible thumping bigots in the world..."
192 is actually a fulfillment of prophecy, for the governments are even now
193 growing weary of the power religion wields, and that is Precisely what
194 they are going to do!  "And the ten horns that you saw, and the wild
195 beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and 
196 naked, and will eat up her fleshly parts and will completely burn her
197 with fire...because Jehovah God, who judged her, is strong."
198 

Why don't you pull out that dusty volume in your own library, CYM, and
199 enjoy the description of religion's "shameless luxury" and her foretold
200 destruction, in Revelations chapters 17 and 18?

216 OK, then, a revised comment:                                               
217 Thank God (if you exist and will just stop making wars, that is if it is
218 you making them and not those that worship you) for the Native Americans 
219 and the Afro Americans and those that died in wars and all those dead and

222 Oh, by the way, what do you do when you punish someone for a crime in a   
223 totally irreversable way (such as cutting off their hand)?                  
224 Why, you say "Gee, fella, sorry about that!  Let me shake your stub!"

230 Captain America:  I would certainly like to know what you think is so
231 "great" about USA (I presume thats what you are referring to as "America").
232 Could it be the anemic economy?  Or maybe its the corrupt government
233 or the practice of military expansionism.  How about the freedom of
234 religion (as long as its Christianity).
235 How about the astronomical crime rate or the prevalence of bigotry.
236 Yes, we certainly have much to be thankful for; and CYM is right; we owe
237 all of the above to God and Christianity.
238 Although I do not contest many of the moral values professed by Christianity,
239 It has never been my "pleasure" to meet a Christian who has gone beyond
240 professing and has actually practiced these values.  Perhaps the greatest
241 attraction to Christianity for most, is the belief (or pretence) that
242 immoral (sinful in Christianese) behavior is readily forgiven by God
243 through prayer.  This affords them the ability to commit any transgression
244 they desire and still have the opportunity to be forgiven (in God's
245 eyes) and thereby released from guilt.
246 Though I have many thoughts to relate on this subject, I am becoming increas-
247 ingly aware that my present semiconcious state is somewhat inadequate
248 for the formulation of a logical (and grammatical) argument, so......
249 To be continued when I'm fully awake.
250  
251                                                 Dirty Ol' Man

253 DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~DOM~
254 Altho I have several translations of the Bible, and have studied all 
255 of them extensively, I will not pretend to be able to interpret it
256 fully, and anyone who professes to know what Revelations is all about
257 is either lying of crazy. I will say, though, that religion is rarely
258 a cause of war; many other reasons exist & since most differing factions
259 have a different brand of religion it is a convenient label for them.
260 If economicss and the desire for power aren't enough, the desire for
261 freedom is. The wars of the recent past haven't even referred to it.
262 Hitler didn't make war on the Jews (who were a race, not a religion to
263 him), he tried to exterminate them, as he did to the rare blacks in the
264 country (and all non "Aryans"). Most religions profess a desire for peace,
265 unfortunately the humans who must carry out this desire have the same
266 failings as the rest of us & don't know how to make peace.
267    I see a suggestion that making drugs (of all kinds) freely available
268 would eventually reduce the problem. No way. The misuse of antibiotics
269 (and overuse) has already hurt all of us, by reducing there value. Even
270 if it only hurt the abuser, it would not help because evolution is slow,
271 and killing a few off could only affect evolution if these few were the
272 only ones who carried a gene that caused them to misuse the stuff, and
273 none of the rest of us did. This is very unlikely. Next if it is freely
274 available to "adults", how do you keep it from the children? Of course
275 you might want to poison these, as they will die more easily. The abuse
276 of mind affecting drugs already is the major cause of traffic fatalities,
277 and these aren't just the drivers being killed. But then killing 
278 everybody off would eliminate drug abuse.
279 
280 May I ask a few questions about religion?
281 1. which Bible do you read, and why?
282 2. who decided this version is Truth, and no other is
283 3. have you read the "one true book" of any other religion?
284 4. who wrote it?
285 5. has it remained pure to the original?
286 
287 If you say "It doesn't matter, God speaks to me through it, why do you
288 read an English version at all? I have a Hebrew version, and it doesn't
289 say anything to me at all, nor does the Vulgate.
290 Yes, Religion is a good subject, it can keep us calling each other dirty
291 names for ever. Before you start accusing religion of starting wars, may
292 I ask you to suggest a way to end wars?

297   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>   12:12   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
298      Ah, even in the wee hours of the morn the controversy has begun
299 to rage!  May I offer a cheerful good morning to all my antagonists,
300 (and I'll have you know that I was stranded at work last night because
301 of paying no mind to the stealthy hands of the clock)...Whew!  Many are
302 the issues to confront, and I hope that I will be around to witness the
303 ripple of outrage and surprise spread through the Inn!
304      Well, DOM, I've finally spoken thoughts outrageous enough to
305 merit your attention, eh?  Your observation about why many seek out
306 'Christianity'--because they think they can do anything as long as
307 they go through the ritual of 'prayer' and be forgiven--is a commonly-
308 held misconception about God's attitude.  

It is true that Jehovah is
309 "a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-
310 kindness and truth, preserving loving-kindness for thousands, pardoning
311 error and transgression and sin," yet those 'Christians' you speak of
312 overlook the second half of Exodus 34:6,7 "but by no means will he
313 give exemption from punishment."  

I recall that you men were debating
314 about who was qualified to judge their fellow in the matter of crime-
315 not-yet-done; who better than one capable of discerning ALL motives?
316 The Bible describes the heart as being the "seat of motivation" and
317 the examiner as:  "I, Jehovah, am searching the heart, examining the
318 kidneys, even to give to each one according to his ways, according to
319 the fruitage of his dealings." (Jeremiah 17:10)  

Even Jesus himself
320 in his famous Sermon on the Mount (found in Matthew 7:21-23) warned
321 against those who pose as serving him:  "Not everyone saying to me,
322 'Lord, Lord' will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one
323 doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.  Many will
324 say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name,
325 and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in 
326 your name?'  And yet then I will confess to them:  I never knew you!
327 Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness."
328 

     BAD, God does not 'speak to me', nor am I presuming to interpret
329 Revelations--or any of the Bible--myself.  Matthew 11:25 and the first
330 letter of the Corinthians 2:10 may be eye-openers regarding where the
331 understanding of the scriptures comes from.  Nonetheless, a prophet is
332 proved by his prophecy (whether it comes true or not)...

As for your
333 questions, any translation is still God's word, and a comparison of
334 any of the literally-translated Bibles will show the parallel of the
335 ideas.  (The paraphrased ones can be misleading sometimes because of
336 the inherent bias of the person who interprets according to his own
337 beliefs, not staying strictly to the original Hebrew & Greek text.)
338 

The other questions require extensive proof to back my replies, which
339 I will supply in time, but I'm distracted by your last question, for
340 it is the most pertinent to the threads of conversation that have been
341 winding through the Backwater Inn:  how can all wars be stopped?
342 

     As has been pointed out, wars have a wide variety of causes:  
343 whether economic, territorial, struggle for power, or religious, they
344 basicly stem from attitudes of self-exhaltation and rivalry.  (Thats a
345 generalization, I know; but identifying the cause of war is essential
346 to removing it.)  

Some idealistically say, 'why, if everyone just
347 changed their attitudes, there wouldn't be any more wars!'  Sure,
348 thats an important step, but not everyone WILL change their attitudes;
349 you realists among the crowd realize that.  More is needed; perhaps
350 a central world government whose authority all recognize and obey?
351 

Yet, who is qualified to rule the entire earth in justice?--
352 certainly no government today!  Though not pointed out by the
353 churches, the Bible DOES contain the answer.  BAD, you've studied
354 the Bible quite a bit; have you discovered the Bible's theme?

379    this is all availiable under "HELP", also......

381 positioning commands..........
382 
383 LN 24           moves you to the first line after system messages...
384 BO              moves you to LAST LINE ENTERED on system....
385 UP              moves you ONE line UP
386 DO              moves you ONE line DOWN
387 DA or DB        moves you onto the old disk (B) or the current (A)
388 HERE            DISPLAYS current line you are at
389   note:   UP and DO may be generalized to the form of 
390     CO xxx
391 
392    where CO is eithier "UP" or "DO" and xxx is the number of lines
393    to go UP or DOWN......xxx,if left out, defaults to 1
394 
395    LN xxx
396 
397    will move you to the XXXth line of the system...line 24 is the
398    first AVAILIABLE line (it is the first line after system messages)
399 text viewing commands.........
400  
401 LIST            dumps WHOLE disk to you...
402 PRINT           dumps all text AFTER the line YOU ARE CURRENTLY ON
403 PR xx           same as "PRINT", but only dumps xx lines...
404     note that both "control-c" and "BREAK" will stop text output,
405   and leave you positioned at THE LINE YOU INTERRUPTED AT
406 
407   while "control-s" will temporarily pause the system output, to
408  resume listing text, strike any key.....
409 
410 text entering/editing..........
411 
412 ENTER          places system in "ENTER" mode,ALL text typed will
413                appear on the system including "OFF" "HELP" "EXIT"
414                "BYE" or other things we see to offen....to exit
415                enter mode gracefully (leaving no garbage); advance
416                the system ONE (1) line by hitting "RETURN"  key,
417                and then send a "control-C" (note that in "ENTER"
418                mode a "control-C" will DELETE your current line,
419                and return you to "COMMAND" mode....hence the 
420                "RETURN" BEFORE the "control-C")
421 
422 MA 76          enter this command in "COMMAND" mode ("COMMAND"
423                mode can be distingushed from "ENTER" mode by 
424                the prompt of ">" at the beginning of a line)
425                TO ENSURE COMPATIBILITY WITH ALL TERMAINAL USERS!!
426 
427                why 76?? many terminals do not support text beyond 
428                column 80; any text left there is truncated to the
429                80 th column.......why use "MA 76" and not "MA 80"?
430                in the "NU Y" mode the system uses columns 1-4 for
431                LINE NUMBERS...."76" enables users to read text in
432                this mode,also....
433 
434 REPLACE        system will print line YOU ARE AT; query if you
435                really wnat to; and the proceed to place you in
436                "ENTER" mode for ONE LINE...line entered will 
437                replace old line.............

443 example:
444 
445 you entered:
446 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
447 How I love thee ;
448  let me count your fingers,
449 i can not live without you...
450 
451 
452 first thing to do is to position youself at the line WITH THE ERROR!
453 (in this case "let me count your fingers")
454 sooo.....
455 
456 >UP 1
457  let me count your fingers,          << system prints the line you are at>>
458 
459 >ch /your fingers,/the ways../
460  let me count the ways..       << system prints CORRECTED line >>
461 >up 2
462 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ << system moves up 2 lines,prints line at >>
463 >PRI                         <<  print rest >>
464 How I love thee ;
465  let me count the ways..
466 i can not live without you...
467 >                            << text looks OK, and system prompts for
468                                 another command, note that both PRINT
469                                 and PR xx leave you AT the last line
470                                 printed                               >>
471 
472 
473 HINTS/MISC.........
474 
475 NU Y and NU N        
476 
477                          NU Y will cause system to number all lines
478                          PRINTED with their POSITION on the disk (1-629)
479 
480                          NU N will suppress this output....note that
481                          NUmbering does not affect message entry....
482 
483   if, prior to leaving the system you do this:
484 
485 >NU Y
486 
487 >BOTTOM              << BO will suffice...>>
488 
489 206 and I think you guys have slug #$%# in your ears.......
490 
491  when you get back onto the system type:
492 
493 >LN 206     << moves you to place you left off (save # from last time!)
494 
495 and I think you guys have slug #$%# in your ears.....
496 
497 >PRINT      << will print REST of text >>
498  blah...
499  dlah...
500  more blah (unless d has been on)
501 
502 >                          << system prompts for new COMMAND >>
503 
504    note: most COMMANDS can be abbreviated to 2 letters..eg.REPLACE
505  becomes RE,PRINT becomes PRI (yes! thats 3! ),BOTTOM = BO,etc....
506            did i forget anything?????

521 "The Babel fish," said the The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, "is small, 
522 yellow and leechlike, and probably the oddest thing in the universe.  It feeds
523 on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it.
524 It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to
525 nourish itself with.  It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic
526 matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals
527 picked up from the speech centers of the brain which has supplied them.  The
528 practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you
529 can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language.  The 
530 speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed
531 into your mind by your Babel fish."
532    "Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-
533 bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have
534 chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the NON-existance of God.
535    "The argument goes something like this: 'I refuse to prove that I exist,'
536 says God, 'for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.'
537   " 'But,' says Man, 'the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It
538 could not have evolved by chance.  It proves you exist, and so therefore, by
539 your own argument, you don't.  QED'
540    " 'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanishes in
541 a puff of logic.
542    " 'Oh, that as easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black
543 is white and gets himself killed on the next pedestrian crossing.
544    "Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's
545 kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he
546 used it as the central theme of his best-selling book, Well That about Wraps
547 It Up for God.
548    "Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to
549 communications between different races and cultures, has caused more and 
550 bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation."

554 
555 CYM:  It has rarely been my pleasure to meet persons with ideas regarding
556 religion so closely parelleling my own.  Throughout history there have
557 been authors of ficticious material whose intent is to entertain or to
558 misinform the public.  Added to these are the philosophical writers whose
559 works are largely, if not wholly, of a speculative nature.  Why have Christians
560 chosen to accept this collection of unsbstantiated works as fact, especially
561 consid*****  pause the system output, to
408  resume listing text, strike any key.....
409

hipping the
563 Wizard of OZ.
564 
565 d:  Aside from a multitude of quotations from your story book, do you have
566 any other "evidence" that my explanation for Christian disregard for
567 morality is, in fact, a misconception?  During my childhood, I was, for seven
568 years a reluctant church-goer.  Though I have never been a Christian, I am
569 very familiar with that which Christians profess, that which they practice
570 and the lack of correspondance between these.  If my idea is misconcieved,
571 how do you account for the discrepancy?  Upon presenting this question
572 to Christians on previous occaissions, the reply was that weakness is the
573 nature of Man and "sin" (rough translation:  moral transgression)
574 inherant and inevitable in all men (persons); and redemption may be
575 realized only through repentance.  If so, I'm afraid myself and a substantial
576 number of non-Christians I am familiar with have been excluded from the Human
577 race.  I maintain, therefore, that weakness is the nature of Christians
578 and that "sin" is inevitable only for those who fear not retribution nor
579 remorse for their transgressions.
580 
581 This is substantiated by my observation that the most vocal proponents
582 of Christianity often relate a story of their quite amoral past.  Most of
583 these persons claim (probably truthfully) to have been at one time
584 theives, rapists, murderers or whatever.  This indicates to me that moral
585 weakness is engraved into their character and that they now find comfort
586 in their newfound "licence" to remain weak.
587 As for the belief in a supreme intellegence, this is easily explainable
588 by analogy.  Recall your childhood.  While riding in a car at night, did
589 you not look out the window and believe you saw the stars moving?
590 Although the visual sensation of motion is actually due to the viewers
591 motion, it is most often attributed by children to that of the stars themselves.
592 If you attribute intellegence to god perhaps you are merely viewing the
593 universe through the eyes of your own "intellegence."

616 While I would like to indeed claim that I provided it, I must remind
617 you that it was Aaron who did so, and I think that it was very well
618 written at that. In fact I will probably be keeping it around for
619 later reprinting upon need. Thanks Aaron, it was an excelent tutorial.
