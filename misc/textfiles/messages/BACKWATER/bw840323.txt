20 DR. FRANKENSTUPE: AN INTERESTING COMMENT ABOUT PMS, PERSONALLY I DON'T
21 SEE THE POINT OF CHARGING FOR THE USE OF THE SYSTEM, PARTICULARLY SINCE
22 THE CURRENT INDUSTRY STANDARD IS FOR THE USE TO BE FREE. HOWEVER, OF
23 COURSE IT IS HIS PEROGATIVE TO CHARGE IF HE SO WISHES. I ALSO DO NOT
24 HAVE A TIME LIMIT ON BW. THIS IS DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE BEAST WHICH
25 MAY REQUIRE THAT THE USER BE ON FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME TO 
26 ENTER THEIR MESSAGE. HOWEVER, MOST USERS ARE UNDERSTANDING AND AWARE OF
27 THE TIME DEPENDANT NATURE OF THESE THINGS AND KEEP THEIR ON LINE TIME TO 
28 MINIMUM. SOME EVEN DOWNLOAD THE DATA AND READ IT LATER TO HELP SAVE ON L
29 LINE TIME. THERE IS A TIME LIMIT HOWEVER, IT IS RELATED TO LINE DEAD
30 TIME. IF THERE IS NO ACTIVITY FOR 5 MINUTES THEN BWMS WILL HANGUP ON
31 YOU. THIS TIME LIMIT HAD TO BE INSTALLED WHEN THE FANCY NEW SMART MODEMS
32 STARTED PROLIFERATING AS THE PEOPLE USING THEM DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW
33 TO USE THEM. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE SOFTWARE THAT BWMS RUNS UNDER,
34 IT DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO HANG UP THE PHONE. (THE TIMEOUT HANGUP IS A
35 ADD ON PATCH ON THE OUTSIDE THAT CONSISTS OF A 555 TIMER IC THAT 
36 CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS THE LINE. ALL HARDWARE CONTROLED.) AS SUCH THEY 
37 WOULD HANG THERE ON THE SYSTEM ALL DAY IF THERE WASN'T A TIMEOUT FUNCTION.
38 BUT ANYWAY, THESE SYSTEMS ARE MOST DEFINATLY NOT FREE. THEY COST MONEY, 
39 AND THEY HAVE TO BE PAYED FOR SOMEHOW. SOME SYSTEMS ARE SPONSORED 
40 BY COMPANIES, WHILE OTHERS LIKE BWMS ARE SOLELY PAID FOR BY THE OWNER.
41 SO YOU ASK, "WHAT DO I GET OUT OF IT?" WELL, PURE ENTERTAINMENT VALUE.
42 I AM ABLE TO MEET AND TALK TO PEOPLE THAT I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO
43 OTHERWISE. IT IS ALSO A GOOD FEELING TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE PROVIDING A
44 SERVICE TO THE COMUNITY THAT OTHERS ENJOY. ALSO THE PHONE LINE THAT
45 BWMS USES IS ALSO USED FOR MY DATA COMMUNICATIONS WORK, SO IT WOULD
46 BE THER ANYWAY, SO I AM SIMPLY PUTTING IT TO USE WHEN I AM NOT USING 
47 IT OTHERWISE. THUS THE ONLY REAL EXPENSE IS THE ELECTRICITY TO KEEP THE
48 SYSTEM RUNNING. WHICH AT 30 WATTS FIGURES OUT TO BE ABOUT $1.00 A MONTH
49 THE ONLY OTHER COST IS THE SYSTEM ITSELF WHICH DIDN'T COST ANYTHING
50 SINCE IT WAS BUILT OUT OF JUNK BOX PARTS. (EVEN THE DISK DRIVES WERE
51 RESURECTED FROM THE JUNK PILE, THEY WHERE WORN OUT AND I FIXED THEM
52 UP TO RUN AGAIN. THEY ARE STILL THERE AND RUNNING!) THE SYSTEM
53 HAS HAD TWO MAJOR FAILURES SINCE IT WAS PUT INTO SERVICE. ONCE A DISK
54 DRIVE DIED WHICH WAS REPAIRED. THE OTHER TIME WAS A SOLDER SPLASH ON
55 THE LOGIC BOARD THAT DECIDED TO MAKE ITS PRESENCE KNOWN. ANYWAY, I
56 HAVE HAD A POLICY FROM THE BEGINING THAT THE SYSTEM NOT COST ME ANY
57 MONEY TO OPERATE OTHER THEN THE ELECTRICAL COST. EVEN THAT CAN BE
58 ASSUMED TO BE REEMBERSED AS I ALSO USE BWMS AS A TEST SITE TO TEST
59 COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE. 
60 I HAVE NO PLANS TO IMPLIMENT ANY SORT OF PRICING SCHEME HERE AND WOULD CO
61 CONSIDER IT SAD INDEED IF IT EVER CAME TO NEEDING TO DO THAT. I MAY EVEN
62 SHUT THE SYSTEM DOWN BEFORE DOING SO, AS I JUST DON'T THINK IT IS
63 DESIRABLE WAY TO RUN A PUBLIC BBS. BUT THAT IS JUST MY OPINION.

96   The piper looked around at his companions.  They had become unusually subdued.
97 It was amazing -- who could have imagined that a lady pushing 100 could cow
98 such a group so quickly?  The piper turned back to her and asked,
99   "M'am -- for lack of a better alternative, we have come to ask the Wizard for
100 help.  If indeed he still exists, could he see us?"
101   Dorothy smiled sadly.  "The Wizard you seek was past puberty when he came
102 to Oz.  He died over fifty years ago.  We have had many persons holding the
103 position since then, but all have proven unsatisfactory for one reason or 
104 another.  Our present wizard seems rather preoccupied with other realities
105 and, quite honestly, not all that competent.  His employment has been on
106 probationary status for the last five years.  If you wish to consult him, feel
107 free to do so.  We do not attempt to coerce our wizards, but allow them to do
108 as they wish.  If they violate the Oz code of ethics, or any local laws or
109 ordinances, the penalty is dismissal from the position."  She paused for a 
110 moment, then continued, "In fact, our present wizard needs some motivation
111 and a test should show whether or not we really want to keep him on or whethr
112 we should advertise for a replacement."  She smiled.  "Yes, indeed.  The 
113 request is entirely within our ethical framework.  While you, yourselves wuld
114 not be acceptable as long-term residents, you can be aided as distressed 
115 visitors.  Follow me."
116   Dorothy led the way to the small gate from which she and the clockwork man
117 had issued.  The gate entered a series of tunnels in the stone wall.  Dorothy
118 spoke as they walked down the tunnels.   "We rarely let outsiders into the city
119 any longer.  The tranquility of the city is easily upset by fighting, bickering
120 or unkind behaviour.  We were forced to prepare underground routes like this
121 for unsolicited visitors who were not quite calm enough to travel the city
122 streets.  It is amazing how many greedy persons exist for little reason othr
123 than to deprive others of objects of beauty or utility.  We lost nearly half
124 of the emeralds out of the sidewalks between the palace and the main gate of
125 the city before we realized that unscrupulous visitors had been prying them
126 out of the pavement."  She stopped at a thick wooden door.  "Here we are."
127 She opened the door and gestured.  "Go right on in.  If the wizard is not 
128 expecting you, he does not deserve to hold the position."
129 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

132 Dorthy:
133 
134 No doubt about it, good wizards are hard to find...but I think 
135 I can help you.
136 
137 My employer, Mr. McKane, has extensive experience in 
138 protecting precious jewels. Were you to hire him as your 
139 wizard you would no longer have to worry about people stealing 
140 emeralds from Oz.
141 
142 Though Mr. McKane has no previous wizardry experience he is a 
143 cracker-jack security man. I'm sure he could hire an assistant 
144 from among the many wizards who hang out here. After all, the 
145 place is full of hack wizards that have nothing better to do 
146 with their time than flap their arms and shout silly spells.
147 
148 If you would be interested in contacting Mr. McKane about this 
149 position I can pass your message along to him in Bulgaria.
150 
151                          Sincerely

157 Let's legalize everthing!! Think of the money we taxpayers could save on law
158 enforcement alone!! Lawyers could go back to stoop labor and that would solve 
159 our border problems (after all, lawyers are always stooping to something or
160 other) and look at the saving we would have with no legal fees. Judges could
161 continue to judge but only at the various county/state fairs and beauty pageants
162 Just think what a boon this would be to the economy. All those stolen items
163 that would have to be replaced. Those no-interest loans to government officials
164 wouldn't be illegal anymore so the congress could get on to other things like
165 lowering their tax obligation.

167 M. d' Autun, we are very sorry but we can find no records indicating that your
168 company owns or has ever owned the properties in question. Perhaps there has 
169 been some error?
170 We are somewhat curious regarding your company as we can not find it listed
171 in any of the standard references. When were you incorporated?
172 Finally, there seems to have been some sort of error in your accounting dept.
173 The check for our retainer was returned "NO SUCH ACCOUNT". We hope this will be

332 (AP  FARGO)   In an early dawn raid, elements of the DEA, U.S. Customs,
333 N.D. State Police, and SPCA made the largest drug bust in North Dakota
334 history.  Netted in the raid were 54 kilograms of cocaine, 31 kilograms
335 of cyclomates, 8,541 Barbie and Ken dolls in kinky clothing, and 593
336 small, furry animals.
337 
338 Arrested were 17 assorted thugs of that ruthless crime ring:  the McKane
339 Organization.  Both the suspects and contraband were located in an abandoned
340 warehouse on the outskirts of beautiful downtown Fargo.  Property records
341 indicate that the warehouse was owned by McKane Enterprises Inc.  A DEA
342 spokesman said that the warehouse and all other McKane assets will be
343 seized under the Racketeering Act of 1974.
344 
345 Ms. Gertrude Heathcliff, SPCA representative, gave the following statement:
346 "It was horrible, just horrible.  The conditions in the warehouse were
347 wretched; no heat, no water, and no potty facilities.  McKane was going
348 to sell those small, furry animals to an earmuff factory.  And what he
349 was doing with those Barbie and Ken dolls is a crime against nature.  I
350 didn't even know that was humanly possible."  Ms. Heathcliff indicated
351 that anyone wanting to adopt a small, furry animal should contact their
352 local SPCA office.
353 
354 Arrest warrants for multiple felony counts are still outstanding on the
355 following subjects:  Leroy McKane, Monsoir d'Autun, and Dufus Penfield.
356 Any citizen with information on these nasty guys should contact either
357 their local FBI office or SPCA representative.

410 a special kind of magic that fills a childs soul -- a wonder that lasts a 
411 lifetime.  Knowing you and your friends through the Oz books made my childhood
412 a much better place."  He stopped and hesitated for a moment, then kissed her
413 on her withered cheek.  "Thank you very much -- for being you."
414    She smiled briefly, and -- perhaps it was a trick of the light -- within
415 the aged form, the piper felt more that saw the shape of a pretty young girl.
416   Dorothy smiled, but looked at him skeptically.  "You must want something.
417 What is it?"
418   The piper flushed again, then asked, "None of the rest of the party seem
419 too concerned, but I know that there were many other children and others
420 that I had felt were my friends as a child.  What happened to them?"
421   Dorothy answered, "The children that cam before puberty have mostly stayed
422 the same age that they arrived.  A few have decided to grow old -- Betsy 
423 Bobbin now appears in her late 40's --
424 but most children do not really want to age.  The magical creatures have 
425 remained generally unchanged, except for Jack Pumpkinhead.  He grew a number
426 of large gourds one year by mistake.  When his last head spoiled he had to 
427 make do with a large gourd with a painted face.  He found it so convenient
428 and much lighter than a carved pumpkinhead, and decided not to return to
429 sucessive pumpkinheads.  He moved in from the farm and became one of Ozma's
430 main advisors."  She paused for a moment.  "You had better join the others.
431 If the wizard gives you any trouble, contact me."  She looked at the piper
432 for a long moment.  "If you don't come back this way, and need to talk to me,
433 tie this over your eyes and follow what you see."  She handed the piper a 
434 silk handkerchief embroidered with a golden "d".  The hankerchief was feather
435 light and smelled faintly of violets as the piper put it inside his tunic.
436 He bowed deeply to Dorothy, nodded his head at Tik-Toc, who had followed, then
437 stepped within the doorway to join the rest of the party.

465 Your intial efforts against Mckane seem to be progessing well. We note
466 that Wassir & co, are taking credit. While we don't mind the false trail, this
467 kind of thing should not be encouraged. We do have a reputation to protect!
468 If they persist, take appropriate action.

472 Big Raid is Hoax!
473 Fargo, ND (AP)
474 DEA and ASPCA official deny any knowledge of the raid reported
475 yesterday. "We have no idea where this rumor started" said one DEA officer, "in
476 fact there warehouse we are supposed to have raided has been closed for some 
477 time. And no one has ever heard of this 'Mckane Enterprises'"
478 The ASPCA notes that while there are large numbers of animals available 
479 for adoption, their records show that this is due to a slower than normal
480 adoption rate over the past few months. "They did not come from this raid", said
481 a spokesman. It is theorized that a computer "hacker" may have inserted the 
482 story into various news agency computers. Investigations are proceeding here at 
483 Associated Press

485 M. d'Autun looked at his mail, what was this? His letter to Penfield---
486 marked "Cannot Deliver as Addressed".........
487 He picked up the phone to call the Post Office -- he started to dial
488  -- strange, the call didn't seem to be going thru. He depressed the switchhook
489 and listened -- there wasn't any dial tone

494 Sir: we have a large quantity of drugs that we feel you might be interested in.
495 We are making you a special deal. Quit taking credit for our work & you can have
496 the drugs (and certain other ownerless items we seem to have acquired...),
497 continue-- and you shall discover how uncomfortable life in a "goldfish bowl can
498 be.
499 We deal in information-- and there are many who would be glad to know 
500 about some of your dealings. For instance, the matter of those suitcase nukes 
501 that were on their way to Libya? Col. Khaddafi would be MOST interested in where
502 they wound up.
503 I await your reply.

540 This will mean a bonus for the first agent to crack this

578 Re: Illegal Use of Reality Pills by Unauthorized Personal
579 
580 To: Whom it may concern
581 
582 
583 It has come to our attention that certain users of this medium have 
584 somehow come into access of reality pills, pills not meant for consumption
585 by the masses, but for the consumption of special individuals hand picked
586 by us for our tests. 
587 We are not sure how the above mentioned individuals received these
588 pills, whether the leak be inside our organization or outside. We are of
589 course interested in, shall we say, plugging these leaks, as soon as
590 possible.
591 Any aid from the good users of this system would be greatly
592 appreciated. An of course cash benefits could result in the sucessful
593 prosecution of any involved in this plot.
594 
595 Thank you for your patience. I will be checking in periodically.
596 I hope we can secure this situation.
