28 Mikey:What;s this about ^O's? So sorry if they have caused your terminal problems. In the future, I will ^A all my pauses.
29 Q.M. Glad to see your return. The material is the same witty 'stuff' we have grown to love.
30 E. Ryan: No response? I thought as much. Why compound your embarrasement by showing up again. Writing is such sweet sorrow.
31 Piper: I have been trying to get in touch with you re: the graphics we spoke of one fine day at PC&S. When is the best
32 time.
33 WESTERCONNERS: At last, the photograph you have been waiting for. The Barbarian Women, those four cuties from the Days of
34 Conan, are now available in print. Order today... 3X5 or 8X10. Matte board optional and extra. Picture now available for 
35 viewing at PSU photolab, Science Building I. Also,
36 various other costumed entrants, including the famous, "The Humans Must Never See Us Eat" and "Wilma Deering of Buck Rodgers

39 	"Uh...Where are you taking me?", queried Farley, now feeling better about the situation after being reunited
40 with his watch and his gun. "You'll see." Typical NET answer. Vague, uncertain, but always superior in tone and inclination.
41 	Fellows chipped in a happy thought. "Ian should have directed Puff to resmear the new occupants of the safehouse. I guess
42 losing the place isn't so bad after all, if it took nearly 50 of the enemy out of action. But I still feel bad about the
43 good agents we lost." L'homme was quick to answer. "In this business you can't afford to feel much of anything, lest it
44 interfer with the mission at hand. There's time for crying your eyes out after finishing." "That's what they tell us, isn't
45 it?", Fellows countered. "Is that REALLY how you feel Parity?" Farlet sensed a long drawn out reply coming, so he decided
46 this was the best time to cut in. "Why are you letting me come along with you. What possible good could I do amoungst the 
47 likes of NET agents?" Parity abrubtly stopped walking, and turned to face Farley, looking him squarely in the eye. "You
48 have a raw talent, and energy if you will, that I think we can use. You have shown fortitude and expertise in your pursuit
49 of Joshua that can't be ignored. You have rough edges that need refinement, to be sure, but don't sell yourself short. NET
50 rarely makes judgement mistakes about possible agents, and this little trip we are about to take will help us finalize
51 our desision. #Possible agent! Little trip!#, Farley's mind raced. #They want me in their organization?!?# "Now don't let
52 this go to your head. Like I said, this little trip will tell us quite a bit of what's left to be found out about you."
53 L'homme didn't tell Farley what would happen if the trip showed Farley wasn't up to NET standards, but a developing
54 grin on Fellow's face told him the score was clear to the two NET agents present. "Onward to our destination!", Fellows
55 roared, jokingly striking a Napoleon-like pose, complete with hand stuffed between buttons on shirt. "Too much starch? Got
56 an iche?", laughed Parity. Fellows blushed a bit, and the trio continued onward to the South Park Blocks, looking like three
57 informal businessmen on their way to lunch. Looks can be so deceiving.

86 to remembering names.  To answer your question, no, I don't recall ever 
87 persuing those tomes.  How is your fantasy knowledge?  Have you read the whole
88 of The Unbeliever series (Lord Foul's Bane, The Illearth War, etc.)?

93 Miller - I also read your 'language'.  But then, I saw your mention of if
94 (it) on CBBS/NW.
95 All - maybe none of you are eligible to take the Mensa test--no one caught
96 the fact that I left out WHAT DAY the test was.  Well, they can always use
97 the test fee anyway, so the next test is Saturday, February 23.

100 ALL: Hmmm. Everyone seems to be rather annoyed with this romance state. 
101 Personally, I don't mind. I wonder why everyone else does? And, with NET.
102 I have nothing against NET at all, please don't think I do. But, to me it
103 gets a little boring at times. This is probabley caused by the fact that I
104 don't do any writing in it, don't understand it, and have difficulty 
105 following the story line. (But I still enjoy reading it, don't get me wrong).
106 So, I enjoy the other stuff... ang I am puzzled by the particularly critical
107 voice it has been recieving lately. Not only the romances, but the many of
108 the other stuff, as well. I just wanted to say to many of you other writers:
109 it is enjoyed and appreciated. Keep up the good work! (oh, by the way NET 
110 writers: I'm not trying to sound harsh or anything. I hope it didn't come 
111 off that way). Well, don't disappear y'all. Keep writing. Please...
112 |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
113 One more thing I forgot... What's wrong with having all this different 
114 writing enter mixed? What's wrong with having net/romance state together?
115 Just wondering... (I really hope this doesn't sound like a violent assault.
116 ) Enter only! Oh well, better than those twits.
117 MELISSA: Where ya been???????

120 Hmmm, hope ENTER ONLY doesn't last too much longer, my '#' key is getting a little fried...
121 \_\_\_\_\_ above: If anything, your opinion seems apologetic.  No one here is going to tear out your throat if you
122 say, plainly, that at times the NET writing gets to you.  On the contrary, some of the writers might try harder to make
123 the story REALLY interesting.  No comment, large or small, is thrown out.
124 Quizmaster: I was thinking about investigating Mensa, but never did get around to it.  Are you a member?  If so, could
125 you tell me what exactly the members do?
126 Ian: I wave the white flag- if I can't crack the level 4 code in a few weeks then it's highly improbable that I'm
127 going to at all.  I'm beginning to see CPPAL PFXL[ in my sleep, not to mention on the inside of my eyelids when I
128 blink.

130 A comment on the current phase on Backwater: It seems that new literary eddies are forming.  I had wondered what 
131 happens when patrons got tired of fantasy (no matter how cleverly contrived), tired of debate (no matter how 'hot' the
132 subject), and tired of NET (no matter how pretzel-shaped the plot).  The answer, in my eyes, seems simple: new types of
133 stories develop.  Perhaps this is how the NET got started, after a long series of fantasy entries.  I haven't been
134 around long enough to know.  What I do know is that even though the story types and names may change, I keep calling
135 back to see what has transpired:
136 Here, at the Backwater Inn.
137 #$##$##$##$#
138 I do hope I'm right in assuming that PorSFis is on the 26th.  I might, if I am lucky, actually attend two meetings in
139 a row.

160 Rising young porno Poloriod picture star 'Petrov' had 
161 his career cut short today, when he suffered a severe 
162 accident during the taping of the 29 minute VCR  epic 
163 "Goat Lusters".   Reports indicate that a jealous ram 
164 butted  him in a highly vulnerable area while he  was 
165 enacting  a love scene with the female lead.   Petrov 
166 was  reportedly carried out on a stretcher  screaming 
167 in  a high pitched voice "Do it again!  Do it again!"   
168 The ram refused to comment on the matter,  and  tryed 
169 to  eat the microphone.   The female lead would  only 
170 respond with a mournful "Baaaaa.....".   The producer 
171 Mr.  Black  Shepherd appeared to be quite  frustrated 
172 with the whole affair when he remarked,  "Now what am 
173 I going to do? It's going to take me at least another 
174 whole day to find a replacment!"   The films backer a 
175 Mr.  Mackane was unavailable for comment,  though his 
176 secratary did respond with a non-commital "Huh?"

181   Some people call me knifeweider and this is odd, because some people call me a harlequin romance writer.
182   Forgive me, but do romance writers write from memories of what their loss of idealism was like?  Do romance writers
183 tell people what they wished had happened when their basis for existance was destroyed?
184   Don't any of you realize what those stories were?  Or do you care that it was the distant memories of a psychotic time
185 that sent the feeling of death across the words?
186   I was trying to do something more important than a simple harlequin piece, even finding someone else like that in the
187 end of the story was A DREAM I have had for a long time.

200     Omega jerked hard at calf muscles, avoiding the oncoming fire with the weird luck of a died in the wool Net agent.
201     Leaping out of the strafing fire of a poor marksman, Omega found tempPorary shelter behind the communications panel.
202     Sme fool let loose with a squirt of flame thrower juice, as it sprayed, un-ignited, the enemy marksmen under the stiff
203 sprays realized what was going to happen to them.
204 
205     Agent Sorrell held the can over his wide shoulders and was gripping the spout with two fingers leaving the others to hold
206 the igniter away from the spray.  It was far more efficient to keep these agents frightened out of their witts than it was to
207 set the whole block on fire.
208     And Sorrell knew it only too well, except if he got hit,? his trigger would strike the spout and ignite.  Then they might
209 all die, and end up on some pathetic local news program.

223   L'homme -- try me at home during the evenings.  (I did give you my home 
224 phone no didn't I?)  I am up till about 9:00 P.M.  If you must try during
225 working hours, try between 7:30 and 9:30 in the A.M.  This seems to be the
226 least crazy of my working hours.  Feel free to call during the rest of the
227 day at work, but the probability of catching me at my desk has been quite
228 low during the last few weeks -- I hope it settles down soon...
229 ppppppppppppppppppp
230   To the "romance" authors ... one of the most difficult problems in reading
231 criticism of one's work is the flack you take from those who do not enjoy
232 a particular genre of writing.  Some folks confuse the subject with the
233 technique and lable a subject that is not interesting TO THEM as "bad writing."
234 Some, with more subtlety, throw the story into a pigeonhole that they assume
235 contains an excess of "bad writing."  Thus "romance" (sorry about the label,
236 but it's the nickname of your subject around here) gets labled as a
237 "harlequin romance."  (By the way, don't  make the common mistake of dismissing
238 an entire catagory of fiction.  There are some excellent writers in that
239 general catagory.  If anyone needs a reccomendation, please ask.)
240   We all, of course, feel that our own writing is "good writing."  However,
241 we all can improve -- none of us is perfect.  Please take good, constructive
242 criticism in the spirit in which it is intended, an attempt to help each of
243 us become better at an activity which we seem to enjoy.  As an example, a
244 recent criticism of one of my entries took me to task for using the phrase
245 "hot tropical sun" -- a presumed redundancy.  Although I might quibble with
246 that phrase, I tried to describe a tropical sun that was not hot... I could
247 only manage a sunset... looks to me like a unmodified tropical sun really is
248 hot.  Perhaps it is redundant.  Oh, well, another trite phrase bites the 
249 dust.  Therefore I make this solemn vow:  I will carefully, anxiously,
250 earnestly, and obnoxiously avoid any an all excess redundancy and repeating
251 the same information too many times in too many different places in this here
252 writing stuff.  Note that I cleverly kept the definition of "too much"
253 obscure and will fight a precise definition with great vigor.

264 "A prospective NET agent?," I whispered.  Could my luck be turning better?  Was this the end of countless
265 failures, lost opprotunities, and bad dealings that had so dominated my life for the past few months?
266 #Better not get my hopes up yet,# I thought.  #If I blow this one, I'm in DEEP trouble.#
267 I decided to take my mind off of it.  No sense brooding on what you can't change, at least for the moment.  I looked
268 at my chrono and saw several miniature lights on that I never noticed before.  The largest was labled in almost 
269 microscopic print, "System Failure".  The only thing my chronocom seemed to be able to do was tell time- some sort
270 of electromagnetic pulse had destroyed the remainder of the functions.  #Drat, I wonder if Fred was knocked out too?#
271 I thanked whatever gods exist for this little reminder of my usual bad luck.   I  swore that I would never forget it
272 again- for if I did, next time more than my chrono would be inoperable...
273 "Farley!", someone yelled.  I broke out of my concentration with a start.  L'homme had obviously been trying to 
274 say something to me for several moments.  "Yes?", I said.
275 "Pay closer attention.  While you were standing there daydreaming you could have been shot nine times over.  What 
276 I asked was, 'What do those lights on your watch signify?'."  He seemed a bit irritated with me, not at all like his
277 previous joking mood.
278 "Oh, er... Well, they mean that I can't communicate with Fred.  The communications functions have been knocked out."
279 The irritated look on L'homme's face faded.  Fellows appeared interested too.  "Who's Fred?", they asked.
280 "My car.", I said.
281 "You talk with your car?", L'homme asked, amused.
282 "He's semi-sentinent.  He helped me while I was tracking Joshua.  I don't know where Fred is, now."
283 "Well, you'll just have to cope without him.  We've almost arrived at our destination."
284 "Where's that?", I asked.
285 "You'll see...", Fellows replied, in the typical vague and obscure NET manner.

287   The last couple of times that I've called the Backwater, to write another
288 episode of the Magen story, I was shocked by some of the crudeness. Maybe I
289 have led a sheltered life, growing up in the South. I don't wish to tell
290 anyone what they should or shouldn't do, but I don't wish to have my name
291 and writing along side that sort of thing. This is the reason I've been quiet
292 for the last few days. I'll wait and see if this is only a passing phase.

295  Do NET agents love anyone? Can someone out there tell me with any degree of certainty that NET agents care for any-
296  thing besides the gun they carry and their current purpose in life. Aren't secret agents supposed to be notorious
297  lovers? Look at the most famous spy, James Bond. Is signiture is the trail of broken hearts he leaves in cities
298  accross the globe. Detectives, spies, double agents, undercover cops: all male oriented with male writers and male
299  players. Women are simple playthings to be used for enjoyment, and an occasional bit of information or two. If we
300  must be subjected to the internal workings of an organization such as NET, let us get a little different perspective
301  on the various internal workings of the agents that make up the NET. Let us get some character development. Let us
302  read about characters who do more than live to play the game in the fast lane. Everyone needs to come down once in 
303  awhile. Let us read about one of these moments. Let us see what makes a NET agent tick. Take the blinds off the
304  story, and let us view the whole situation.
305                                                  Let's hear it!

307 JoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshuaJoshua
308 ()()(): in my admittedly too-infrequent entries, I HAVE attempted to portray
309 Joshua as a human rather than an infallible superman.  Mistakes, doubts, and
310 other such normal traits.  Not too much, since NET *IS* supposed to be elite,
311 and I certainly don't want to play an Inspector Clousseu (damnded French spellings...)
312 One problem with character development is that it takes a lot of space, space
313 which is a precious commodity on this board, and space which would preferrably
314 (by us) be used to advance the story.  Last summer L'homme and I were travelling
315 from the 13th floor of a building to the street.  It took us at least 150 lines, 
316 none of them action, because we WERE trying to work on our characters.
317 As I recall, it met with less than enthusiastic response.
318 As for the male perspective, we do have a part time female agent, yclept
319 Gaudy Minsky, who offers us a decidedly different viewpoint.  Given the 
320 male/female ratio of BackWater users, I doubt we're descriminatory.
321 	See y'all at PorSFiS.

324 PROMETHEAN KNIFEWIELDER: I give credit for quite a bit. I enjoyed your story, 
325 and I knew there was more to it than I could figure. Why it got labeled a 
326 "romance" is beyond me. I didn't think it that way... anyways, I thought it
327 was excellent. Please continue to write such things, it's nice to know there
328 really was something behind it. 
329 MELISSA: The stuff you've seen here which is not to your liking, is probabley
330 not to many of ours (if you are speaking of that classified ad stuff, and 
331 things along similiar lines). I will venture to say that the majority of the
332 people who visit the Inn are above that... but there are always a few vandals,
333 here and there, and people to our disliking. If you wish to take a few days 
334 from your story, it's understandable... but, please, return eventually.
335 ADRIAN: So, where are you? Oh, I noticed a message for you on Aloha. I didn't
336 know you visited other systems, I haven't seen your name anywhere. I suppose
337 then "Adrian" is an alias.
338 ALL: I'm not a fan of harlequin romances. They disgust me, as do most others.
339 But, I think a common error is to assume all romances are like harlequin ones.
340 A great example of a love story which is very good is "The Siver Metal Lover"
341 by Tanith Lee. It's excellent! It's changed my percpective on most romances,
342 I don't judge them so quickly (I haven't been able to read those ones in Fred
343 Meyers, I don't think I ever will). Anyways, if you read this you might realize
344 that romances don't have to follow a mindless storyline... they can even be as
345 good as sci fi, fantasy, and novels! Wow! Bet you'd never believe that... well,
346 I think this book is an exception to the awful-romance rule. It's one of the 
347 best books I've read (of ANY catigory). If any of you read it, tell me what you
348 think.

380 for peoples feelings? I can think of dozens of ways that you could of stated 
381 that withour being so unnecessarily harsh, and still made the same point. Did
382 you deliberitly choose such a cruel way of wording your attack? It angers me to
383 think that some people can be so inconsiderate of the feelings of others. Many
384 of these new writers (which I think are very good) are abit timid and scared 
385 about writing their entries, being so outrightly rude is enough to cause them 
386 never return. Or was that the idea? I agree with you, I must say. But, why 
387 do you have to be so God------ mean about it! I hope you haven't caused Melissa

416     A tale of Piprov...
417 
418 I wandered about through the scorching heat for what seemed like forever. I constantly had to tell mysel-ter was
419 (oop) myself water was over tAs the sun began to sink on the horizon the first day, I fell to the sand and began
420 to think of all the things I had done in my life. I figured that I had lived a rather happy life, and was
421 dissapointed that I had to die young and unknown. 
422    By the time the moon had risen full in the sky, my eyes were so caked with sand I could not close 
423 them. Instead, I rolled over into the sand and waited for deaths' grim hand to clutch my soul...
424 I assumed my mind would simply cloud over and that would be all, never did I expect to hear or see what I did... 
425 a small lamb gently baa-ing. I lifted my head and was somewhat surprised to find myself in a grassy meadow, 
426 up
427 
428 surrounded by a flock of sheep. I looked down at what I remembered as being tattered and dusty garments, only to
429 find that I was wearing shepards clothing. I had in my hand a shepards staff, and in my other hand, a horn.
430 Why this was I could not and still cannot explain, but I have grown to enjoy the company of the sheep. I have
431 especially grown fond of the lamb that I first heard long ago. She has grown into a graceful ewe and I have never
432 been apart from 'She' ever since.

533  
534      When I was only five, and very sick with the measles, I remember
535 waking from the midst of such a dream as only a fever can bring, to find
536 her there: her hand on mine, the other wiping my brow with a cool cloth.
537 Such is the first memory I have of my grandmother, but it is so typical of
538 the many memories that were to be created throughout the years that
539 followed.
540  
541      I remember the days at the zoo, the parks, the museums, the many trips
542 to interesting places and the ideas they helped to stir in my young mind.
543 I remember how she used to read to me, and, Oh! what she read: Swift,
544 Twain, even Dickens were introduced to me by her, and worlds were opened.
545 And how she introduced me to science fiction with C.S. Lewis' "Out of the
546 Silent Planet", then the works of Wells and Verne when she saw how eagerly
547 I grasped at the wonders of that marvelous field of literature.  The public
548 schools taught me the mechanics of reading, but she taught me the joy that
549 can be found between the covers of a book long before I could comprehend
550 the words on a page.
551  
552      I guess it was easy to love her, she never needed to discipline me.
553 My parents were quite competent in that field, and thus she was left free
554 to give me an education in so many other ways.  And love her I did, though
555 in typical childish fashion I never expressed that love in a manner that
556 the adult I have become now wishes I had.  But a child never thinks of such
557 things.  Why should she, the world is static and never changes, Grandma
558 will always be there, Grandma knows everything and so knows how I feel.
559  
560      But the child grows older, and eventually enters a stage of self-
561 imposed independance.  For a period of years, this independance interferes
562 with the ability to remember the simple but honest emotions of childhood,
563 having defined them as childish and therefore not suitable for the
564 new-found maturity.  Sometimes this foolishness can place a block between
565 the adult and the child, the adult feeling justifiably hurt at the child's
566 behavior.  In my case, my grandmother understood.  She could remember how
567 she was at that age, and so could carry within her a greater understanding
568 than the child would have thought possible.
569  
570      When the return to sanity comes, if it comes at all, it is all too
571 often too late.  I was lucky.  When I truly became an adult, long after I
572 had physically matured, she was still there, patiently waiting for me to
573 talk to and share with.  And so we found the closeness once again that we
574 had possessed in those earlier years.  But now I found that the scene was
575 reversed.  Though she was still capable of teaching me so much, and I found
576 that I was just as enthusiastic a student, she was older.  It was harder
577 for her to go to the museums, the parks, the zoo.  And with her eyesight
578 failing, she could read only with extreme effort.  So I began to read to
579 her as she once read to me, and I introduced her to authors that she
580 devoured as hungrily as I once had:  Asimov, Clarke, Sturgeon, Ellison,
581 others.  Much to my surprise, Ellison soon became her favorite author
582 (writer! as he would say), and we quickly worked through all of his short
583 stories and essays.  I found anew that our tastes were nearly always the
584 same, which is as it should be since my tastes were developed at her knee.
585  
586      I know that, if I had been only five years younger, or had not
587 eventually arrived at adulthood, I might have missed these last years with
588 her.  But I was lucky, I did arrive there, and so was blessed with her
589 warmth and knowledge and deep understanding.  The thought that I might have
590 missed all of that....... is something I would rather not think of.  So
591 here's to you, dear grandma, with love and thanks.  For everything.

598 Voyeur:  Yes indeed, that was the same motel (with light-bulb and plastic   
599 log) that you overheard (overread?) me speaking of to Salazar.  And yes, I
600 did catch a bug while there, my unfortunate dip in the warm winter waters of
601 the Pacific ocean did wonders for my health as well as my well-being.
602 It was one of those trips that will be remembered fondly for many years to
603 come, though at the first it seemed to be the beginnings of the greatest
604 disaster epic never filmed.  Sorry I took so long to respond to you, I'm
