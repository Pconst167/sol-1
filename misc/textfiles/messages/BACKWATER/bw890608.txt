 25 At the top! Yet again. Ok, looks like I opened a can of worms on the last disk.

 27 (This will be short as I need to get to bed.) It is indeed a very complex 
 28 issue, and one that will never really be settled I am sure. But I feel that
 29 the common ownership of guns tends to moderate the actions of a government. If
 30 you don't fear your populace, you are going to tend to be a good deal less 
 31 carefull about what they think.

 84 and now, we finally know:
 85             BUGS MIGHT ANSWER UFO QUESTION:-6/9/89
 86     Electromagnetic fields and the habits of common insects might explain many 
 87 sightings of unidentified flying objects. Dr. Phillip Callahan of the Optical 
 88 Society of America hit on the idea after he discovered insects give off a 
 89 visible glow when placed in a magnetic field. He reasoned that such fields - 
 90 common in the storm fronts - could cause such a glow and trigger UFO reports.
 91                                                                             
 92             IMELDA MARCOS SINGS:-6/9/89
 93     Imelda Marcos' first album is called "Imelda Papin Featuring Songs with 
 94 Mrs. Imelda Marcos." And you can get your hands on it starting Sunday. It 
 95 features Marcos as guest singer of some of her favorite U.S. and Filipino 
 96 songs - including "Feelings." The 12-song, 43-minute cassette is a collection 
 97 of songs selected by entertainer Imelda Papin, the record's producer.
 98 You'll want to get the C.D. so you get the highest audio quality, and it won't 
 99 ever wear out.

101             BUSH `DISAPPOINTED' WITH CHINA:-6/9/89
102     President Bush expressed a "certain sense of personal disappointment" 
103 Thursday at the threat of civil war in China. Bush, the first U.S. envoy to 
104 China in modern times, repeatedly spoke of his concern for the human rights of 
105 the Chinese people and the importance of U.S.-China relations at his first 
106 prime-time news conference.
107     The exodus of foreigners from Beijing is slowing as the military and 
108 political turmoil eases. Restaurants, shops and post offices reopened Thursday 
109 as soldiers cleaned up debris in Tiananmen Square. Other soldiers continued to 
110 fire into the air. Meanwhile, Secretary of State James Baker said U.S.-China 
111 relations suffered "a tragic step backward," but said economic ties should 
112 continue.
113     China's Premier Li Peng appeared on a national TV news show - his first 
114 since the army killed at least 500. Li told a cheering audience of military 
115 men in the Great Hall of the People that the soldiers had "done a brilliant 
116 job of carrying out the orders of the state council." Meanwhile, The U.S. 
117 Voice of America said it was now sending TV signals via satellite to Beijing - 
118 a first.
119                                                                             
120               EXXON SAYS IT WILL SAVE EAGLES:-6/9/89
121     Exxon Corp., in a press release, says it and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
122 Service plan to capture and clean bald eagles and other birds of prey 
123 jeopardized by the March 24 oil spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker. Eagles 
124 will be taken to the Alaska Avian Research and Rehabilitation Center in 
125 Anchorage for treatment. Last month, Exxon said it provided $100,000 for 
126 construction of the center.

161          Hello Dear Friends;
162  
163          Dis is Bobby McFerrin wit some timely summertime advise now dat 
164          finals are over and de sun is warm and de livin' is sooooo easy.
165          Unscrew dat skull, mon, give dat brain a break, let dat grey 
166          matter go limp. You owe it to yourself, mon. An' to help you wit 
167          dat important phase in your intellectual development, here we 
168          have for you some Timely Summertime Tips..............
169  
170                          DRINK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
171          And keep an eye out for bargains. Hamms beer in cases of cans 
172          will go on sale regularly in the $6 - $7 dollar range this 
173          summer. Be frugal and tank up.
174  
175                        WATCH A LOT OF CABLE TELEVISION
176          * Start with TODAY on NBC. See Jane. See Jane wax prissy. See 
177          Bryant. See Bryant wax egotistical. See Willard. See Willard 
178          bumble bucolic. Very Good.
179          * Be sure to spend at least an hour a day with the HOME SHOPPING 
180          NETWORK. As life tends to be short, go on ahead and order that
181          lovely ceramic figurine of The Tinman from The Wizard of Oz
182          (be sure to use someone else's VISA card, though)
183          * Don't forget the real estate get-rich-quick talkshow/really-long
184          -commercial presentations. Take notes.
185          * Check in with Morton Downey Jr. and Geraldo regularly (avoid 
186          Donahue and Oprah, however....too stuffy)
187          * Don't forget THE WEATHER CHANNEL. Watch for off the cuff ad-
188          libs between the perky Weather Hosts.
189          * Alternate between game shows and soap operas on odd/even days.
190          * Pay special attention to commercials (especially the late 
191          night, 90 second Record Treasury variety)
192  
193                                    READ{ TRASH
194          Never mind the summer reading lists from your professors. 
195          Subscribe immediately to THE WEEKLY WORLD NEWS, THE STAR and THE 
196          GLOBE. Stick with supermarket paperbacks that have lush paintings of
197          busty women or the words  As Told To  on the cover.
198  
199                           PATRONIZE YOUR LOCAL CINEPLEX
200          See every summer release with a roman numeral in the title. 
201          Avoid Cinema 21 and The Movie House. Eschew anything with subtitles
202          or good reviews. And demand extra petroleum on your popcorn.
203  
204  
205          Follow dese simple tips, mon, an you'll be ready for another 
206          bashing when de school bell ring in de fall. No problem in de 
207          great northwest in de hot summertime mon. Everythin' irie.

223 Sound advice. STV was a dissapointment. It had its funny moments, but was
224 just to fantasyish for me to enjoy. 'Lets bop around the entire galaxy in
225 less then a day, blowing away any sort of consistent theory on what warp
226 drives are supposed to be capable of!'
227  
228 Well, I'm looking for someplace to live. Anybody know of a good place? I can
229 afford around 300$ rent and utilities. Suggestions welcome.
230  
231 Got a 68010,a hard drive controler and a 10meg hard drive at the cpm swaw
232 meet today. So far I`ve checked out the 68010 and the controler, and both
233 work. Now, with any luck the hard drive will as well. All I have to do
234 is figure out were to put it. 1 full height floppy and full height 
235 hard drive (Which is what I have.) tend to fill up a pc's drive bays.

281 I know that every able bodied Hebrew Isreali has to spend a certain amount
282 of time in the armed forces (this includes the women), but I don't think
283 that the home posession of Uzi's is mandatory.  After all, the Isreali

313 Ah, the old Civil War defense. I suggest reading the beginning chapters of a
314 Civil War history book (or even the whole book). The causes of this conflict
315 are much more than one side wanting slaves and the other side not wanting
316 slaves. The causes are also a lot more complex than one group of states
317 saying "We don't like your rules so we quit!" I feel the Civil War
318 analogy fails becaue first of all, the origins of the split between the
319 states are not easily categorized. Secondly, I feel it is wrong to
320 compare mid 1800's and today in terms of gun ownership and use. In those
321 days, hunting was a primary source of food, unlike today, where Sir
322 Safeway does all the slaying. Thirdly, no one has answered my questions
323 about countries that have different governmental systems from the USA
324 and their accompanying gun laws.

332 Well, now, for starters, I must disagree with several of your statements
333 re: the Civil War issue. Firstly, I am indeed familar with it, and if you
334 will note secondly, I said nothing of slavery that was in reality a minor
335 issue in the thing. Many of those in the North had slaves too. As I said, 
336 there were conflicts between the concepts that the North and South had
337 about how things should be. I never brought the slave issue up, that was
338 just you reading into my message what you wanted to see.
339 You then shifted into stating that the Civil War was not an acceptable 
340 analogy because the issues are not easily catgorized and that issues of 1800
341 don't apply today. I suppose I could say "well now, then we had best throw
342 out the constitution then since it is much older then that." But there is 
343 more here then that. First, what analogy? Do you mean a direct comparion to
344 the problems in China? Hardly an analogy. There is no analogy to that issue.
345 The point I was making is that we too have suffered from the atrocities that
346 result when two factions are unable to settle their differences in a peacful
347 manner. That is the only analogy I was making. It was stated that it would
348 never happen in America. I was simply pointing out that it already has.
349 And as I also stated, the aspects of guns had little to do with it. 
350 This is hardly the only incident where one group of people have violently
351 impressed their belief structure on another group, it is simply on of the
352 more blatant and apparent ones. Throughout our history we had treated
353 various groups with somthing less than "hello, nice day isn't it?" 
354 We spent many years decimating the locals (what we call generically 'indians')
355 I'm sure that you'll say "but that's different. That was then this is now."
356 Nevertheless, the fact is that we as a nation decimated the indians and 
357 took their home lands with little or nothing in return, killing them when 
358 they objected to the treatment. Or how about the way the blacks have been 
359 treated. Even today the government often turns a blind eye to them. 
360 Then there was the Kent State thing that was brought up. That was pretty
361 close to what happened in China. Maybe not to the extent as in China,
362 but along the same lines. And howmany remember the Democratic national
363 convention in Chicago. While the demonstrators chanted "The whole world
364 is watching." Which it indeed was. The Chicago police went in swinging.
365 It was not a pretty sight, and Chicago has had a rather bad reputation
366 that lasts even today in that issue.
367 Then look at the streets of our own city, the drive-by shootings. Not much
368 different than back in the prohibition era that. But I gues it's not the
369 same because that was then and this is now. Ahh, such an easy cop out that
370 statement.
371 In regard to the issue of guns and other forms of government, I did respond
372 a bit there, but you might have missed that. The problem is that ANY issue
373 of the life styles of those in communist counties is diffuclt to deal with
374 because they generally keep to themselves and do not allow others to view
375 their country too closely. Good or Bad? I won't argue that, because I can
376 say that it is bad, but that is because my upbringing in the western culture
377 says that it is bad. Yet who am I to say that my culture is better? It is
378 hardly all that wonderful on many issues. Until I have lived a life fully
379 as integrated in the culture as my life in the American culture, I cannot
380 truthfully say that I can pass judgment on that culture.
381 I will make mention though that I did watch a very interesting documentary
382 on Ch 10 a couple of weeks ago  covering... gun control. They delt with it
383 on a world scale, not just the American culture. The interesting thing they 
384 made mention of is that contrary to popular belief, many Eastern block 
385 countries do allow ownership of guns. While on the opposite side, there are
386 some Western block countries which have stricter gun controls than the eastern
387 block countries. It is not universal that Communism means you can't own a 
388 gun. It is however a good generalization that eastern block countries tend
389 to have geater restrictions. It is just not valid to believe this to be 
390 always the case. Each country has its own social structure to which it holds.

396 TOPIC - NECKTIE:
397     Chuck Bowden, author and free-lance writer, and Harry Schwartz,
398  former New York Times editorial writer, discuss their views.
399     
400     BOWDEN: The necktie fetish has been more deadly to our nation's moral 
401 sinews than all the rubber goods and leather-freak stuff ever dreamed up by 
402 Larry Flynt. At least the people into heavy kink keep their notions behind 
403 closed doors. Basically, neckties are a disease - like alcoholism, drug 
404 addiction and the desire to run for public office - and should be treated 
405 accordingly.
406     SCHWARTZ: Modern convention virtually requires males to wear sedate, dull 
407 clothes, with forgettable colors and patterns. Only in his tie is a man 
408 licensed to show his aesthetic sense, his love of colors and patterns, his 
409 biological kinship to the peacock. The man who refuses to wear a tie is 
410 voluntarily ceding to the female of our species a monopoly on bright colors 
411 and interesting patterns.
412                                                                           
413 MORAL MAJORITY DISAPPEARS:-6/12/89
414     The Moral Majority is being disbanded. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who founded 
415 the group in 1979, said it succeeded in getting Christians politically 
416 involved. The group became a force in U.S. politics in the 1980s, helping 
417 elect three GOP administrations, Falwell said. But Moral Majority lost clout 
418 after the PTL and Jimmy Swaggart scandals undermined confidence in 
419 televangelism.
420

423 OIL HALTS ALASKA FISHING:-6/12/89
424     Salmon fishing was suspended Friday near Cook Inlet, Alaska, after crude 
425 oil was spotted on beaches near the town of Chenik and the McNeil River. 
426 Seiners had expected to harvest 425,000 sockeye and 130,000 chum salmon this 
427 summer. Only 7,000 sockeye and 50 chum were taken before Friday's closure.

436 UNOCAL DENIES CHARGES:-6/12/89
437     Unocal Corp. has denied that the company's polymers plant in La Mirada, 
438 Calif., is one of the worst toxic polluters in the country, as has been 
439 characterized in some news reports. Allegations of cancer risk to employees 
440 and neighbors of the plant are not true, said Richard Stegemeier, Unocal 
441 chairman. Risk data cited was not based on the plant's record, according to 
442 the company.
443 key phrase here:  "according to the company"
444                                                                              
445 KEMP EYES HUD EMBEZZLERS:-6/12/89
446     Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp is "very upset" by 
447 accusations that private agents embezzled millions of dollars from the agency, 
448 according to HUD lawyer Frank Keating on Sunday. He has ordered an immediate 
449 probe, Keating said. The Washington Post reports losses could reach $10 
450 million in HUD's Washington office.
451  
452 HUD SUSPENDS FOUR PENDING AUDIT:
453     The head of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's 
454 Washington field office and three staff members have been relieved of their 
455 duties pending the outcome of an audit by the HUD inspector general. Sources 
456 say that while criminality might not be involved, there appears to be 
457 carelessness and oversight that cost the government $10 million.
458                                                                       
459 DENG WANTS DISSIDENT ARRESTED:-6/12/89
460     Chinese leader Deng Xiaopeng, continuing his purge of reformers, Sunday 
461 ordered the arrest of a dissident hiding in the U.S. embassy. Warrants were 
462 issued for Fang Lizhi and wife Li Shuxian. Chinese TV pushed the government's 
463 view of the violence, showing crowds attacking soldiers, torching army tanks - 
464 and prisoners signing confessions.
465     Ex-presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan spoke their views Sunday on 
466 China's future. "The door that has been opened ... toward freedom and 
467 democracy can't be completely closed," Carter said. "What we're seeing now is 
468 what a lot of us have known for many years - that communism couldn't really be 
469 a successful system," Reagan said on CBS' "Sunday Morning."
470     Teachers and students on the university campuses in Beijing vowed Sunday 
471 to keep up their protests despite mass arrests. As campuses emptied for 
472 summer, those who remained said the movement would revive in the next six 
473 months to a year after troops leave Beijing. Students scoffed at government 
474 news programs featuring the arrests of the purported leaders of pro-democracy 
475 demonstrations.
476  
477 Frank Zappa:  "And they were so certain it couldn't happen here."

480 It is hard to truely understand the actions and motives of a people in 
481 a land far away and steeped in a different culture. We cry out in support
482 for those that fight for "freedom" because that is our culture. How can 
483 we truely understand a government and culture that builds itself on 
484 economic reform, but then when greater steps towards social and plotical
485 freedom are demanded by a "disident" group, they are not just arrested and
486 thrown in jail as we would expect by our own society's rules, but rather
487 they are run over with tanks and killed. This by a government that achieved
488 it's very current position by decrying those very actions of the past
489 regeme. How can anyone understand such actions?
490 I do hope that they find a peaceful existance quickly, but I don't expect
491 it anytime soon. The younger generation has been exposed to a whole new
492 world, and as an old greek philosipher once said, "Once a mind has been
493 opened to new possibilities, it can never be closed."

531 PAY HIKES WILL BE INVISIBLE:-6/13/89
532     Inflation might swallow salaried workers' 1989 pay hikes, says The 
533 Conference Board in its annual pay survey released Monday. Salaried workers' 
534 pay increases will average 5 percent this year and next, unchanged from 1987 
535 and 1988. But in 1987 and 1988 inflation was only 4.4 percent. Economists say 
536 they expect inflation to hit 5 percent this year, gobbling up the increase.
537     Companies are making up for smaller salary hikes by giving more lump-sum 
538 incentives that don't lock companies into paying high salaries, says Charles 
539 Peck, specialist at The Conference Board. The board polled 501 companies for 
540 the survey.

550     The fifth annual Harlan Page Hubbard Lemon Awards were presented Monday in

553 by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and the Consumer Federation 
554 of America - is named for a 19th-century ad man who peddled cure-all tonics.
555     Harlan Page Hubbard Lemon Award winners include Mercedes-Benz of North 
556 America Inc. for encouraging high-speed driving and Anheuser-Busch Inc. for 
557 Spuds MacKenzie's Bud Light beer ads that encourage the young to drink. 
558 Mercedes-Benz response: The ad doesn't intend to promote reckless driving. 
559 Anheuser-Busch response: Its ads are produced for drinking-age audiences.
560     R.J. Reynolds Tobacco USA is a winner of the Harlan Page Hubbard Lemon 
561 Award for Joe the cartoon Camel's ad that sends youth messages that its cool 
562 to smoke. R.J. Reynolds response: the ads appeal to young men who already 
563 smoke. Other "winners": Thompson Medical Co.for Dexatrim diet aids that deny

568 OIL SPILL CAUSES LABOR PROBLEM:-6/13/89
569     Fish canneries, hotels, restaurants and nursing homes in Alaska are facing 
570 severe labor shortages because many workers are getting more money - about 
571 $1,800 a week - by helping to clean up the Exxon oil spill. The Valdez Chamber 
572 of Commerce has asked Exxon to subsidize the wages paid by local businesses 
573 and the company is considering helping, says spokesperson Henry Beathard.
574                                                                              
575 BUSH PUSHES ALTERNATE FUELS:-6/13/89
576  President Bush's air-cleanup plans include strong programs to use alternative 
577 fuels in cars. Many experts say it could do more harm than good. Bush wants to 
578 require automakers to phase in cars that use alternate fuels. His goal: 
579 500,000 vehicles operating in six years, 1 million produced annually after 1996
580     The alternative-fuel emphasis President Bush puts in his clean-air 
581 campaign doesn't do much to abate global warming, and it neglects fuel 
582 efficiency as the most powerful way to cut emissions, some say. "Looking at 
583 alternative fuels as an alternative to efficiency is the worst thing you can 
584 do," said Deborah Bleviss of the International Institute for Energy Efficiency.
585     The most important step that can be taken to deter air pollution and the 
586 greenhouse effect is to improve mileage efficiency and beef up car 
587 inspections, specialists say. That should give automakers time to develop 
588 vehicles that run on sources such as hydrogen, electricity or solar power that 
589 don't emit carbon dioxide.
590     Environmentalists fear President Bush's clean-air campaign emphasizing 
591 alternative fuels will divert attention from more effective ways of reducing 
592 toxic emissions from motor vehicles. Those produce half of nitrogen oxides and 
593 one-third of hydrocarbons that produce smog, acid rain and ozone pollution, 
594 experts say.
595 DEBATE - AIR USA TODAY'S OPINION:
596     President Bush offered a realistic plan Monday to breathe new life into 
597 the nation's pace-setting Clean Air Act, smog-bound for a decade by White 
598 House indifference, opposition from polluters and political hot air. The plan 
599 doesn't answer environmentalists' dreams, but it does offer hope the 
600 stagnation will end.
601  OTHER VIEWS:
602     BOB LONG, editor of Green Synthesis: There are no easy ways to secure 
603 clean air. Strict enforcement of existing laws plus new legislation may slow 
604 air-quality deterioration. At best, this is the most we can expect from 
605 present governmental action.
606     PATRICK COX, political and economic analyst: Every new set of laws and 
607 regulations promises profound solutions to difficult problems. Regrettably, 
608 bureaucratic management has dubious record at best and often has quite clearly 
609 worsened the very situations it has designed to solve.
610     SEN. MAX BAUCUS, D-Mont., sponsor of clean air bill: "The rhetoric is 
611 good, but it's a bit vague in the urban smog provisions."
612     PRESIDENT BUSH: "Too many Americans continue to breathe dirty air, and 
613 political paralysis has plagued further progress against air pollution ... 
614 It's time to clear the air."
615     SEN. ROBERT BYRD, D-W.Va.: "The proposal, by leading to massive switching 
616 from high-sulfur to low-sulfur coal, will serve as a disincentive to the use 
617 of clean-coal technologies."
618     BROOKS B. YEAGER, Audubon Society: "We may quarrel with some of the 
619 details, but it's certainly a major step forward."
620     EAST MEADOW, N.Y., Marie Parisi, 66, retired secretary: "I would love to 
621 have clean air, but I'm tired of paying out so much money. Taxes are so high 
622 in Nassau County, and when you're on a fixed income, you try to watch your 
623 expenses. Something should be done about the trucks and buses that put all the 
624 smoke in the air from their exhaust pipes."
625     WASHINGTON, D.C., Lance Elliott, 45, association executive: "No one wants 
626 to pay more, but I would be willing to for this particular issue. Clean air is 
627 a critical issue for the continued viability of society and the planet itself.

648 A "mocking" position? I suppose you could look at it that way. You simply 
649 dismissed the arguments out of hand by taking them out of context and putting
650 words in my mouth, so I thought I'd reply in kind. You chose the debate and
651 the weapons, I'm just using them. 
652 In regard to your point about my not answering your question about guns and
653 socialist countries. I'm not sure specifically what you are refering to here.
654 Do you mean you original question about How many socialist/communist countries
655 have gun laws similar to the US?  As I mentioned in my last three messages and
656 I will do so again, my knowledge of such things is limited because the
657 information is not generally available. It is just plain hard to get that sort
658 of information. Much of what I know is gleaned from what I read in magazines,
659 papers, and see in documentaries on TV. Not the best source for information,
660 but short of being there and living in the countries there is little that 
661 can be done to improve the information flow. 
662 In specific answer (assuming that the afore mentioned question is the one 
663 you are expressing interest in), I have to say that I don't know specifically
664 how many socialistic countries have laws similar to the US. I can say what
665 I have deduced based on what I have seen and read, which is probably none by
666 the definition that most people would use. But then that would be true of 
667 western countries too. The US is rather unyaue in that respect. Most countries
668 consider our ideas about guns to verge on lunacy. 
669 Bases on the documentary that I previously mentioned, there is one soviet
670 block country which goes so far as to allow ownership of not just rifles, but
671 also hand guns. This is because it is a tradition within the country that 
672 apparently was very important to the people. And no, I don't remember the 
673 name of the country, I simply watched the documentary because it was 
674 interesting, I didn't take notes. Gee, I didn't know there was going to
675 be a pop quiz! ;-)

694    AD, if you don't mind long drives or bus rides, check out the Beaverton
695 area for apardments.  I admit, you will be a little hard pressed to keep
696 the rent and utilities down to $300, but most of the apartments here
697 are usually taken care of, unlike other cities.
698  
699    As for the hard drive & controller, well, what EXACTLY do you have?
700 Is it SCSI MFM? Or RLL?  Will the drive accept Seagate stuff?
701 I really can't help you that much, but I hope I could point you
702 into the right direction.
703  
704    And finally, as for the argument between L'H-S-P & his(?) adversaby,
705 why can't you just take the third side of the coin?  Do you know how
706 irritating it is you hear "there are only TWO sides" when "I SEE THREE"?
707 For every situation, there will be THREE choices, not TWO.  Try sitting
708 on both of your rumps & contemplating this before standing up again.
709 What is happening in China?  Anarchy at its best.  Civil War at worst.
710 But that's not important.  The government there is not important.  The
711 "Student Groups" there are not important.  THE PEOPLE THERE ARE
712 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.  Many people have been killed (as in
713 they cease to be), and I think many more will be killed.  What the
714 world will see (and nothing else) is a struggle for power.  Shut
715 out the editorials that you see on television, ignore the snide comments
716 you may read in the paper or magazine, and read between the lines.
717 People are dying.  And all because people choose to believe in
718 a concept that has been far outdated: GOVERNMENT.  The people of
719 the world will never understand why governments don't work, simply
720 because they take governments for granted.  For a moment I had great
721 hope for China as the troops and the students simply stood and
722 stared at each other.  It was the best outcome possible; no
723 violence, no bloodshed, no deaths, but still the Chinese government
724 remained, and still the students protested.  Had the goverment had
725 the balls to negotiate with the students (the wiser choice), things
726 might not be as bad as they are now.  But someone in Power decided that
727 they did not want to loose their priviledges.  And you know
728 how I feel about priviledges (look up the root words for what I mean).
729 Why can't we simply do something a little more constructive that
730 would please everyone - as in reaching a common verdict about

906 CM-
907 I remember when I first came on the board.  We had some rousing debates
908 about everything.  I had DJJ and a couple of others, and we had the
909 arch conservatives versus the liberals.  Those were fun days in my mind,
910 were they for you?  
911 And we also had 629 lines of 132 characters each.  (I was using a VT100)
912 And 1200 baud was fast...  
913 And the first major shift I remember was when Pam wrote her description
914 of the Inn.  I was at Dendrite, so it must have been in late 84.  Then we 
915 went adventuring, and Friar came about.  He has been with me through thick
916 and thin ever since.  Even for debates.
917 I have changed a lot in the past six or so years, but haven't we all.
918 Of the one's not here now, I miss Pam and Piper the most.  I saved a disk 
919 of Atari software for almost four years for Pam, but I never found a way
920 to get it to her.  And Piper was always one of the key drivers of the 
921 adventures, at least until the Bolos.  
922 Of the people I still hear of, Milchar, L'Homme and Mohammed Wassir are 
923 the longest lived, excepting of course, you and I, and Milch may predate
924 me.  I never got the archives.  I suppose I should, and read them all 
925 again.
926 Ah, but I ramble.  Forgive an old soul his rambling.
927 A new era, a new time happens for all of us.   For myself, A new thread of 
928 time started when I first heard our daughter's heartbeat.  Time stopped,
929 jumped to one side, and started on a different track.  There is no backing
930 up over the switch.  We are on a totally separate track now.
931 Think back, over your life.  Has it always been gradual change?  Or is it
932 more a series of sameness punctuated by flashes of transformation?  Was 
933 there a particular year or month or day or instant when the whole of 
934 existence seemed so alive and intense that you were not certain if you
935 could stand0the intensity?  I have had periods of years where my feelings
936 about the world and myself did not change dramatically, even in comparison
937 with hindsight.  And then WHAM!  Reality throws me a medicine ball.  And
938 life and existance changes, never able to go back to the comfort of things
939 known.
940 Perhaps BW is like that.  We had been debating, arguing, fighting.  Venting
941 rhetoric and diatribes.  Then POW!  In comes a sweet innocence that stuns
942 us, instantly.  
943 Oh sure, we grope and argue for a while more, because that is what we
944 have found comfort in knowing in the past.  But inexoribly, the future drags
945 us to its breast, feeding us what we need to become changed people, a 
946 new kind of BBSer.
947 And the process happened another time, when BWMS became BWMS II.  And the
948 changes were more dramatic.  It seemed that a lot of the old guard just
949 vanished.  We had General Zod, after a time.  We had some wonderful new
950 people, like Hagbard, Astral Dreamer,  etc.  And a few of the old timers,
951 Milchar showing up, myself lurking mostly, CM lurking mostly.
952 (CM always lurked mostly)
953 Things change and grow.  The Earthly existance we have chosen to create is
954 as perfect as we want it to be.  (K.A. Notwithstanding.)  And I am glad to
955 have numbered you and the people here among my friends and companions.

973 CONGRESS TACKLES KIDS AND GUNS:-6/15/89
974     The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence says a child dies every day in the 
975 United States in an accidental shooting. Another 10 under age 18 are injured 
976 daily. The figures have prompted U.S. House subcommittee hearings Thursday on 
977 guns and kids. The issue takes on urgency now as the country enters summer,

989 home with an ample supply of ammunition. And the same goes for a handgun and a 
990 shotgun.
991     THOMPSON: Try telling the importance of guns to a bespectacled Indian

995 Friar: no, no imenant danger. The key level is the relationship between
996 my power bill and the phone bill. When the phone bill average exceeds
997 the power bill average, that is when I do something to correct the
