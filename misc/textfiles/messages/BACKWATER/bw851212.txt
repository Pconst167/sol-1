24    "...kill him. I'll kill him..."
25    "Kill who?"
26    James jolted awake when he realized that he had been actually speaking. He relaxed when he saw that it wasn't
27 Putzie standing over him. It was a much older man, more than a little overweight with a receding white hairline and a
28 neat, greying beard. He had a warm, friendly twinkle in his eye that would put the most nervous patient to ease. "Oh.
29 Hi, Doc Kanden."
30    Doc Kanden had a small medical scanner that he was studying. After a moment, he looked up. "You sounded pretty
31 upset. Who is it that you are intending to kill in my hospital?"
32    "Three guesses." James replied grumpily. Despite his aggravation, he actually felt much better.
33    "I see. Why you two can't get along is beyond me. By the way, I've turned off the neutralizer. Try to move your
34 left arm, just a little."
35    James slowly raised his hand and his back started throbbing immediately. He tried to move it across his chest. Then
36 he felt pain. No, he felt Pain. In a pinched voice, he said, "Hurts, Doc."
37    "As well it should." Doc Kanden grabbed his wrist and gently placed he arm back where it was. The pain quickly
38 subsided to excruciating. "But you are still healing amazingly fast. Only five days and you are already halfway to
39 being discharged. Anybody else I'd expect to still be critical. You were very badly hurt. Willerd did a masterful job
40 of patching you up."
41    "Yeah, I guess he did. But I sure ain't gonna tell him."
42    Doc Kanden sighed, "I didn't really think so."
43    As he started to leave, James called out "Wait."
44    Doc turned around grimly. He already knew what James was going to ask.
45    "What about the rest?"
46    Doc suddenly looked and sounded much older. "It doesn't look good. The force you were using to sustain yourself has
47 been badly depleted and you lost some ground. From the looks of things you probably cut your remaining time down by a
48 quarter."
49    James was silent, trying to let it soak in. A quarter...
50    Doc Kanden continued, "I'm sorry..."
51    James waved him off. "Don't be. I'd... just like to be alone for a while."
52    The doctor left quietly and James was left alone with his thoughts again.

59 Franklin Pervis eased into his comfortable old work chair and flicked on the
60 word processor in front of him. Already , his first article had provided a
61 few leads... as well as more than a few crackpot calls from people either 
62 claiming to be Delta V or those who swore he had killed their mother not
63 three or four weeks ago.
64 
65 He stared at the papers in front of him. He glanced at a plain white card,
66 sent to him from some guy named Nick Young. Pervis chuckled and muttered to
67 himself about the crackpots who come out of the woodwork claiming to know
68 something about everything but who in fact only want to see their name in
69 the paper. He tossed the card in the round file and continued leafing through
70 the papers.
71 
72 The memo from Scotland Yard intrigued him most. His source was impeccable, and
73 Franklin noted wryly that suddenly his subject was under the scrutiny of a lot
74 of different people around the world. He didn't know if it was due to his 
75 article or not, and he didn't care.
76 
77 He just wasn't sure whether he really wanted to be investigating this man,
78 he could almost feel the presence of him around every corner. His stench
79 of death pervaded every sense of Franklin Pervis' being.
80 
81 He wiped his brow and began his second entry, in what he hoped would be a
82 continuing series of articles.
83 
84 But he could never quite shake that feeling of dread...

97 TRIPPING ON BOOKS by Clark
98  
99         I...have...fallen into the book, but that's impossible!!! I mean it's
100 a great book and all but people just don't go around falling into the
101 plots of the books they read. This can't be happening! There must be
102 another explanation...
103         "How would you answer the question Mr Gray?"
104         He was asking Tim to respond to the question! Panic has a way of
105 clogging the throat of even the most talkative student. Panic over the
106 question; panic over the whole situation.
107         "I am sorry, could you repeat the question?"
108         "Certainly Mr Gray, but next time pay a little more attention if you
109 will. The question concerns the roots of our new State Act in the
110 redistribution-of-wealth movements starting late 1988."
111         Shit! It's only 1985. Or it was only 1985. Er, I have only lived to
112 1985. What am I going to...
113         "The class is waiting. Certainly you remember the Frenchman I.M.
114 Meager's movements of the period? It was he who was mainly responsible for
115 most of the uprisings across Europe."
116         "Yes, of course. Meager... Well I would say the new Act is the
117 State's effort to redistribute the wealth of the people into... the
118 government's hands. I mean that's what it looks like to me. It's like the
119 Infernal Revenue Service in the eighties, only worse. Now they want
120 everything!"
121         A silenced hush fell over the classroom. Tim then realized what he
122 just said could probably be construed as treason under the new government.
123 Normally he would never think of acting treasonable, but this was anything
124 but normal.
125         "Very interesting observation Tim. I would like to talk to you after
126 class, if you wouldn't mind."
127         Tim could hardly believe it. "Sure." was the only thing he could
128 manage to mutter.
129         The class then went on almost as if nothing happened. Tim did
130 notice that a few of the other students in the classroom stole occasional
131 glances at him though.
132         After class Tim crammed all of his books, including his copy of
133 "George's War", into a red vinyl-like carrying bag. He stayed seated while
134 professor Gratis talked to a few students at the front of the room. Soon
135 the lingering students left, and George made his way to where Tim sat.
136         George Gratis was about 6 feet tall. His hair was closely cropped,
137 but his full beard did not share the same careful attention. He wore the
138 same brown fatigues that everyone else wore, including Tim. Instead of the
139 clothes appearing almost tailor-made like they did for the other students,
140 George's hung from his large frame in unruly patterns. George sat at on a
141 desk opposite of Tim's seat.
142         "That was a very interesting answer you gave today Tim. How long
143 have you felt this way about the government." Professor Gratis spoke in
144 hushed tones, as if wanting to keep this conversation for Tim's ears only.
145         What could Tim say that wouldn't sound crazy? He had been transported
146 into a science fiction book twelve years in the future. He was sitting before
147 the main character in the book, discussing treasonable subjects regarding
148 the State. Tim was sitting with a professor in a classroom like he had a
149 hundred times in three and a-half years at his university. Tim was in
150 another world, and he didn't know quite what to say.

160 TO : MR. MacHinery
161 
162      Apparently those jokers at undergound are at it again. Ears
163 have picked up increased transmission on their broascast lines,
164 and content seems to be regarding the Delta 5/Wassir/European
165 affair. Since the crypto department broke their code last summer,
166 we have had little trouble keeping tabs on underground, but their
167 interference on this matter could cause complications. May we
168 remind you of the infamous 'Stumblefoot' incident two years ago
169 involving that underground agent who managed to fall into a
170 firefight between NET agents and the Dangerfield kamakazi squad.
171      The complete report is contained online under /fool/org.

176 "I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Pervis, but this was just delivered and the
177 messenger said you'd want to see it immediately...." Pervis opened the large manila envelope and
178 extracted to contents. A photograph fell out and landed at the feet of the man
179 who was sitting across from Franklin. He picked it up, gasped, and fell back into his chair. He
180 had instantly recognized the woman and two children posed standing in front of the nearly new 
181 frame house... Franklin too, was looking at a photograph, and was equally paled. He quickly invest-
182 igated the other items on his desk. There were two keys. His heart sank, and he shuddered. The
183 key was distinct, it was an Abloy, tho only pickproof lock on the market, and there was a number
184 scratched on it. It was his house number. The note was one typewritten sheet, and said simply,
185 "Mr. Pervis, Mr 
186 Young. I believe you understand what is meant by the items in front of you. Now. My "threat" was
187 intended to scare you, and only that. I do not go around offing people unless they are an immediate
188 threat to me. I see I have succeeded in making you understand what it is like to live with fear.
189 I livw with it every day of my life. I was never going to kill you, Pervis. I will not kill you
190 nor will I interfere in your life in any way, as long as you leave me alone. And when I give my 
191 word, I keep it. You will find this to be true when you recieve the communique that was recently
192 sent to you from Scotland Yard."
193    The note went on to say" This is to you, Mr. Young. You are way out of your league. Leave it
194 alone or you will not live to see Christmas, and I think yhe people in the photo will miss you.
195 There was no signature, but scotch taped to the botom of the page was a triangle made of yellow
196 plastic. Engraved in the center was the Roman numeral five.

221 Outside the night was as black as a coal miners tee-shirt and the rain was 
222 coming down in sheets. An occasional stab of lighting would fill the room 
223 with white light. The room was a well appointed library with all the 
224 trimmings you had grown accustomed to seeing in all those old black and 
225 white mystery movies of the late thirties and early forties. Only this was 
226 no play-it-for-fun mystery where everyone went home at the conclusion and 
227 had a nice warm meal then went to bed with the little woman for a nice bit 
228 of tail and a long snooze.
229    You were standing in the middle of the room looking down at the very 
230 ugly and very dead body of what had been up until about what appeared to be
231 about an hour or two ago your not so loving ex-wife. She wore a death 
232 grimmace for a smile, not unlike the only smile she ever gave you when she
233  was living. A hard thought to have at a time like this, but all you could 
234 think of was how you would not have to make out this months alimony check 
235 after all.
236    The call came into your home phone at 1:00 am not two hours after you 
237 had gone to bed after a long day up the gorge on an insurance investigation
238 for one of the wealthy Japanese fruit growers having a problem with some of
239 his hispanic pickers claiming a bad back after a fall from a ladder. Yes, 
240 you had come to this. Not the glamorus image everyone has of a private 
241 investigator. No Magnum PI this. The voice on the other end of the line 
242 told you in a strangely artificial tone that should meet this person at 
243 the Zinns residence in one hour if you were available and interested in a 
244 considerable fee. Fee, that was the magic word and you were off without a 
245 second thought. Your first mistake. Not however the last.

250     Cragmore, Emu and Bard headed back into the control room in
251 silence.  The trip was soon to be over, and Emu was a little
252 disappointed.  After seeing that their leader was alright and had
253 reconciled himself with Aedem, Emu knew that there would be little
254 more to the trip than setting the coordinates for the Inn and and 'hit
255 the GO button'.
256     Home.  remembered the strange circumstances under which they left. 
257 The Zephyr the rabbit had almost ruined the mission before it had even
258 started.  "He's probably still there whimpering away." Emu thought out
259 loud.  "I wonder...   when did we leave..."
260     Cragmore and Bard weren't sure what Emu was mumbling about as he
261 seated himself into the pilot's chair, but they did see a snicker
262 suddenly replaced the sullen look that he wore.
263     "Set positional coordinates for the Inn, Bard.  See how close you
264 can come to our point of departure."  Emu almost seemed to swagger with
265 the order.
266     "Aye-aye, captain!" Bard returned, getting into the newfound
267 spirit.  Emu set a couple dials very carefully.  Bard thought he heard
268 Emu mumble something about landing "sur un lapin", but didn't catch
269 the whole phrase.  As Cragmore went back to see what Trainor was
270 calling for, the proverbial switch was "flicked" and they were on
271 their way home.
272 .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.
273 
274     Sitting in front of a small inn, Jedediah Robinson watched the
275 rabbit.  It had just caused quite a commotion, and it had been a long
276 time since Jed had heard such angry words this close to the Rowan
277 tree.  Ever since he came on as gardener, he had never seen the old
278 tree look as wilted as it did just now, just after that nasty scene.
279     The rabbit had almost gotten itself killed, pulling those
280 manipulation tricks.  It was a case of trying to be too cute.  The
281 rabbit thought that it could flash its pretty little eyes and the
282 travelers would give him anything he wanted.  But they didn't let him
283 get away with it.  No, they caught on right quick, though they had
284 trouble getting rid of the little pest.  They didn't want anything
285 manipulating them, and they kicked him out of their ship.
286     Jed knew what it felt like to be manipulated, and felt little
287 sympathy for the rabbit.  It had been treated more than fairly, after
288 what it had done.  Now, it just sat and whimpered, sniffling at the
289 recently vacanted lawn.  Remembering that the back corral still needed
290 mending, Jed started for the workshed.
291     The rabbit sat there for another moment or two, nibbled another
292 blade of grass, and headed for the door of the inn.  After a short
293 time, the door was opened and he slipped in through a magician's feet.
294 
295     A sparkling was first heard, then seen.  The recognizable shift in
296 the wavelength of light foretold the arrival of a time machine.  It
297 slowly began to take shape, and soon was fully materialized.  The
298 artwork on the outsides of the timeship, when seen by even the most
299 unimaginative eye, depicted several scenes involving both human and
300 animal-like bodies in very compromising positions.
301     Presently, the door slid open and several very weary looking
302 travelers stepped into the open.  One was very audible in expressing
303 its delight in "only missing ten minutes of drinking time, but darn
304 it, we missed the damn rabbit!"  The others nodded and chuckled, and
305 all headed into the inn.
306 
307     The travelers didn't notice the slim figure slip out of the
308 machine after them.  Dressed in a black full length robe, it went
309 directly to the Rowan tree, where it snapped off a small sprig. 
310 Turning away, the hood was let down to reveal a beautiful young woman
311 with raven hair.  She kissed the sprig and held it carefully up to
312 her rounded bosum.  With a wink and a sigh, the woman disappeared.

332 made my way to keep up with the pixie that had a lead on me going back up
333 the hill.
334       "I know, I can see it now!  Do you think there'll be anyone left when
335 we get there?"  There was anticipation in her voice.  And rightfully so.

342       "What has?  Have I heard about what?"  She turned and stopped, wait-

351   Yes, the Pell-Mell adventure seems to be done.  Good point about getting
352 together about plot lines -- a slight problem is that I don't venture into
353 the wilds of P---land unless it's unavoidable.  Sigh.  Coordination through
354 story entries seems to be a major problem...
355   On a different level, however --
356 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
357   Several beings were gathered around *SOMETHING*.  A merely human observer
358 would have seen but little -- a slight discoloration in the air, the color
359 of a muted sigh, and heard less.  However, a being with the senses to
360 percieve these sentiences, decode their communications, and convert the
361 objects they were regarding to human frames of reference would have overheard
362 the following conversation:
363   "Well, Galdrian, we've got them all back to the Inn."
364   "Yes.  Mostly undamaged, too."
365   "What about that one?"
366   "Where?"
367   "There.  The one that used to play the strange musical instrument."
368   "It was just cut up slightly.  The stiffness will wear off in a few weeks
369 and it will be able to play the pipes again."
370   "I don't mean physically.  You've gotten it pretty emotionally messed up and
371 it won't be good for much now."
372   Peering into the discolored air, the two beings studied the swirling chaos
373 that represented the subject of their discussion.
374   "Look, Galdrian, you've gotten some unattainable object tangled up with
375 the sex drive and wound in all the affection potentials.  It's glued in with
376 stuff from a life-threatening situation and tied up with a huge knot of guilt.
377 This thing is liable to self-destruct on us!"
378   Peering closer, "You're right.  It doesn't have the backbone to survive in
379 that state!."
380   "Well, Galdrian, what are you going to do about it?"
381 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
382   Ignoring the pain from his arm and the disapproval in the Innkeeper's eyes,
383 the piper stumbled across the floor to the taps, carrying his emptied container.
384   Reluctantly, the Inkeeper drew the ale into the jack and passed it back to
385 the piper, along with some friendly advice that the piper ignored.
386   Stumbling back to his solitary table, the piper sought forgetfulness in the
387 arms of alcohol.

390 And amidst the hustle and bustle of all these creatures at the inn, was the
391 steady pounding of a hammer, as Bear fixed up the floor he had destroyed
392 earlier. Everyone pretty much ignored him, stepping around the hole as if
393 it was merely a minor incovenience.
394 
395 Bear sat by the now much-smaller hole and sighed.

400      "Fellow adventurers, please lend me your attention." Trainor had hopped up
401 on one of the oaken tables so he could survey the entire crowded Inn. "I know
402 you wish to retire to the Roman baths and elsewhere for rest and relaxation,
403 but I wish to say a couple things before I must leave."
404      For one of the few times in the history of the Inn, a majority of the
405 inngoers turned their heads and ears towards the speaker asking for attention.
406 It was an incredible sight, and Trainor knew he must hurry his words before he
407 lost the tiny span of attention the others had seen fit to give him.
408      "You all know what we have been through. We have all suffered," stealing
409 a glance at the down-trodden piper "and some have suffered more than others.
410 But still we go on. Look back, just for a moment, and see what we accomplished.
411 Our group was as diverse as any ever assembled, yet we functioned, and we did
412 end the threat of terror from the creature from Zeb. We also freed a young
413 woman from a bond too horrible to fathom. We have done something grand and we
414 have done something small, and I will leave it up to you to equate which was
415 which. I have come to know all of you, and in doing so I am that many times
416 better. You have all enriched me, and I am grateful. You have helped me with
417 my quest, and I am grateful. You have healed me from wounds so deep I knew not
418 what to do, and I am grateful. So goodbye my friends. May your paths cross
419 the stars and my your lives be fullfilling and happy."
420      With those final words Trainor departed from the Inn. The others were a 
421 bit silent, but slowly conversation turned to other things. Soon laughs and
422 shouts rang from all corners; yes, the adventurers were home.
423      No one noticed the Pell-mell fade on the grassy knoll outside the Inn. One
424 moment it was there, the next it was gone. It was just as well, the Pell-mell
425 adventure was best left to the story tellers anyway.

436 I remember a long time ago, when there were a number of inn-goers who braved the
437 impending doom of downtown, fought off the vagrants muggers and other denziens 
438 of that hot bed of crime, and sheathing their swords, made their way into the anctuar
439 y of the library. Some of you may remember, that great hall with the lecturn at the
440 front, and the ebb and flow of conversation-have you read the newest hitchhiker
441 book, and Henlein has...All sorts of people, looking around to see who showed up
442 and who didn't. And after a time of announcements and entertainment, they all retired
443 to the warm, lay-back atmosphere off another inn. One that has, sadly, fallen by 
444 the wayside, but never forgotten. It was too long ago, when I had just gotten my
445 first modem, and had first visited the inn. Whom do I remember? Piper? Loam? Mic
446 (as in church)char, Petrov, Dreamtoucher, the Bard,Ninja, Gaudy Minsky,and how 
447 many others? So what ever happened? I read that some story lines are all but dead.
448 Stories from way back. Reflections of 'old timers' and regulars. And then someone
449 suggests,perhaps, a collaberation. Compare notes. The Pxoenix stone glows wherever
450 it may be. And a certain Net agent still terrorizes the populace with a supercharged
451 Mustang. Think about it, old timers, and maybe make it to the PorSfIs meeting one
452 of these Saturdays.

460 Well, as for the Phoenix gem I have been awaiting some missing archives
461 before picking up *that* subplot again. As I recall, it was last seen in
462 a high order Slaver stasis field (approx 1e-50 of normal time flow).

485      There was something definitely wrong about the way this has all ended
486 was the thought that ran through the Innkeepers mind as he buffed the last
487 of the few glasses that had been cleaned earlier.  Although the friends
488 that had been dearly missed have now been delivered home safely there was
489 still an aprehension that gripped him.
490      A hand amoung the crowd is raised with the request that yet more
491 refreshments me dispersed within these gay walls of merriment.  The Inn-
492 keeper turned to place the clean glass back on the shelf and picked up two
493 more tankards for the Inn's famous ales.  He paused and took an one extra.
494      Before leaving his place from behind the counter to mingle with the
495 customers that filled the numerous tables he returned to the shelf one
496 more time.  "This ought to do the trick," he thought to himself.
497      Passing the laughter and exchanging smiles the Innkeeper made his way
498 to those that had beckoned for his spirits.  The filled tankards were
499 placed on the tabletop, the empties gathered, and the surface wiped dry
500 with a rapid stroke of a smeared bar towel.  Now for the extra drink...
501      Making his way even further back he soon came upon the one that had
502 returned in silence.  Sequestered to imbibe in peace, this one might not
503 have even noticed the approach for his thoughts were truly elsewhere.
504 Placing the filled container to one side of the one that remained still
505 half-filled, the Innkeeper placed the special object he had taken from the
506 shelf upon the table and nudged it a bit with a carefull dabbing of his
507 tattered towel.
508      "I hope that this may in some small way," said the Innkeeper softly,
509 "return a small piece of life to your sadenned brow...  You left this here
510 quite some time ago.  Oh, and welcome back.  Glad am I to see you once
511 again."  He stopped dabbing at the equestrian figure that sat on the table
512 and headed back to the chores that continued to gather now that he was
513 to tend to the Inn alone.  "Someone around here deserves to be happy,"
514 he thought to himself with a deep sigh.

528 	          Yet, the image of fire prevailed in my mind: the smoke mingling with
529 grayness and the flames burning away the night.  The skies would be set to
530 life by the dancing fire, no clouds would hang over the day as a presentiment
531 to failure.  But instead of this, the flames bruned slowly behind the clouds,
532 afraid to show themselves to my longing eyes.  So my eyes burned with the
533 misplaced fire.
534           "No," I said to the nothingness around me, "no.  I don't like this
535 void."  How long?  Lifetimes, had it been since I had looked into the eye of
536 
537           The shadows moved around me, no longer deathly spectres that seemed
538 to follow my every footstep, they appeared gain a sense of reality.  Taking on
539 a distinctive form, a person melted from the shadows.

554 The materials were as easy to come by as always. He contemplated their use. He really didn't want to, but there
555 was no choice. He walked down Division past 140th and reflected on his day. A typical day in New York City...
556 Just after going through Hunters Gate into Central Park, he was accosted by two would be muggers. "Gimme your
557 wallet, M-----F-----. Same old thing, but Delta V was tired of it all. He just wanted to be left alone, and 
558 this was too much. "Come get it, scum bag" Everyone in the big apple called everyone else "scum bag";or so it
559 seemed. They just didn't understand. One had a knife, the other Nunchukas, swinging them as he attacked. The
560 Walther barked twice, and Central Park had two less muggers. 
561    The thrift store clothes, and two days without shaving gave him the appearance he wanted. He fit in. The
562 desk clerk was as suspicious as always, but the green picture of Grant dispelled any prelimenaries. 
563 He remembered the manuals; he didn't need to, but h did. Sulfuric acid, distilled water, and the sodium cyanide.
564 He sat at the small desk and put together his weapon. Again, he remembered the 'manual'. It's what they use 
565 in the gas chamber, acid and cyanide. Mix the two, and the vapors kill the condemned man. The solution that 
566 is left is Hydrocyanic acid. Sometimes called 'Prussic' acid. He carefully sucked it into the #5 syringe, and
567 set it aside. It was time for sleep. As he dozed of, he remembered the much publicised umbrella incident. 
568 Spray the solution into the victims face, and he dies of a "heart attack". Unless the ME is specifically looking
569 for it, it will pass as just another heart attack. Case closed. 
570 Tomorrow, he would return to Switzerland and kill two men who were a threat to his life.
571 He laid back on the rumpled mattress, and slipped into sleep, and as he did, he wondered...How many more do
572 I have to kill? Only his tremendous self control kept him from vomiting from the revulsion of taking human 
573 lives. He only wanted to kill one man. McKane. And he would. There was never any doubt. But untill then, many
574 others would force his hand. And die. 
575 Delta Five fell asleep wishing this were not real...
576                          D                                                 DDD

622 complaint, only to see the disks go away and no TRSDOS disks return. I know this is not fair to you and I DO feel badly
623 about it. I know after many shifted deadlines you may take my words with a grain of salt, but I PROMISE BY THE END OF
624 CHRISTMAS BREAK YOU WILL HAVE EVERY BW FILE ON YOUR OWN FORMAT DISKS AND EVERYONE ON THE GROUP WILL BE EQUALLY CAUGHT
