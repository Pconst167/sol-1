133    All true! I had a friend that told me that you couldn't
134 go past or ever get to the speed of light. It went something
135 like this:
136    You travel faster and faster. The atoms that are being used
137 up as exhaust is being spitted out the back and makes your ship
138 more massive. Massive in mass pack not massive big. So, it takes
139 more and more fuel to get you faster and faster until finally
140 you get infinitely small. Is this true? It sounds kinda true but
141 there are a few things that don't really make sense.
142    I don't see how time could go faster for someone else while
143 on you, time goes real slow.

151 All computers have their faults.
152   I really haven't opened up a store or even tried to. I have
153 another friend that is going to help me make a mainframe machine.
154 He is also trying to start his own software company. My dad
155 is a real-estate agent. He could track down and locate a good
156 place to start one. The computer I wish to make consists of a
157 8085A Microprocessor with 512 onboard memory. Then there will
158 be 10 hard disks that store about 500 megabytes each; making a
159 total of 5 billion bytes. Think that's enough? Also, lets talk

196 TRON: 
197    BASICLY THATS THE WAY IT GOES. BY THE TIME YOU GET UP NEXT TO LIGHTSPEED
198 YOU HAVE TO CONVERT ALL OF YOUR MASS TO ENERGY TO GO ANY FASTER.. WHICH OF
199 COURSE MEANS THERE'S NOTHING LEFT OF YOU TO GO FASTER....
200 NOW LETS CONSIDER SOME IMPLICATIONS HERE .. FIRST WHAT IF YOU UNBALANCE
201 THE EQUATION. THAT IS WHAT IF YOU COULD 'BORROW' ENERGY FROM SOMEPLACE
202 ELSE? (I DON'T KNOW WHERE, I AM JUST POSING THE QUESTION) THE USUALL
203 RESPONSE I GET IS THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE, BUT THEY GENERALLY FALL INTO
204 A FIT OF DON'T ASK THAT QUESTION IT'S NOT PROPER WHEN I PUSH IT.
205 (I TEND TO LIKE TO PUSH PEOPLE LIKE THAT WHEN THEY SAY SOMETHING IS
206 NOT POSSIBLE, FIND A POSSIBLE WAY AROUND THE PROBLEM AND SEE HOW THEY 
207 REACT WHETHER THE MEANS AROUND THE PROBLEM IS DOABLE OR NOT. AT LEAST
208 IT GETS THEM THINKING.) ANOUTHER SIDE OF THE EQUATION YOU CAN FOOL
209 WITH IS THE MASS. THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT IT CONTINUES TO INCREASE
210 AS YOU INCREASE YOUR SPEED. SO WHAT IF YOU WERE TO PREVENT THE MASS
211 FROM INCREASING? HUH? AGAIN THE RESPONSE IS THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE DON'T
212 ASK SUCH STUPID QUESTIONS. BUT IT DOES REMAIN AN OUT IF YOU COULD
213 FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. NOW I'M NOT ADVOCATING THAT ALL THIS IS
214 POSSIBLE WITH TODAYS UNDERSTANDING OF PHYSICS, I'M JUST POINTING
215 OUT AREAS WHERE IT IS WEAK AND SOME HOLES MIGHT BE FOUND.
216 IF YOU CAN'T PROPERLY EXPLAIN IN LAYMANS TERMS WHY SOMETHING IS NOT
217 SO, THEN YOU PROBABLY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
218 ONE ASPECT THAT I DIDN'T COVER IS THE TIME CHANGE FACTOR. THIS ALSO 
219 IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. BASICLY IT SAYS THAT AS YOUR
220 SPEED INCREASES TIME SLOWS DOWN. THIS MEANS THAT BY THE TIME WE
221 GET NEAR TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT AN INFINATE AMOUNT OF TIME WILL
222 HAVE PASSED MEANING THAT OUR TIME IS UP AND WE CAN'T GET THERE IN
223 TIME ANYWAY SO WHAT'S THE POINT? I TEND TO HAVE OTHER FEELINGS
224 IN REGARD TO THIS WHOLE MESS, IT IS BASED ON RELATIVITY AND THE
225 HIESENBURG PRINCIPLE, BUT I GENERALLY DON'T DICUSS IT BECAUSE
226 IF YOU THINK THERE WAS A LOT OF ARGUING GENERATED ABOUT SPEED
227 YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN TIME COMES INTO THE PICTURE.
228 ANOTHER QUOTE, THE GREATER THE ARGUMENT THE GREATER THE CHANCE
229 THAT NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT.
230 REMEBER WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT PAINTING DOORS ON BRICK WALLS.
231  SINCE ALL MOTIVE FORCE EQUATIONS INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO
232 THE RELATIVITY QUESTION INVOLVES RELEASING SOME OF YOUR MASS
233 AS ENERGY TO INCREASE YOUR SPEED. CONSIDER THAT THIS ALL
234 REACTIVE FORCE YOU CAN NEVER GET THERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO 
235 USE UP EVERYTHING TRYING. SO WHAT IF YOU WERE TO USE A CREATIVE
236 FORCE? THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO USE UP YOUR MASS GETTING THERE
237 OF COURSE ALL THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE BY TODAYS PHYSICS, BUT IF 
238 SOMEONE DOES COME UP WITH A CREATIVE FORCE INSTEAD OF THE REACTIVE
239 ONE. THEN AT LEAST ONE PART OF THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED. 
240 (WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASING MASS AND TIME PROBLEMS.)
241 WITH REACTIVE FORCE YOU CAN ONLY GO AS FAST AS THE REACTION CAN TAKE
242 PLACE. SINCE THE MAXIMUM SPEED OF A REACTION IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT WE
243 CAN ONLY GO THIS FAST. WITH CREATIVE FORCE THERE IS NO MAXIMUM SPEED
244 BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT DEALING WITH A PAST REACTION, BUT RATHER A FUTURE ONE.
245 OH YES, I SHOULD SAY HERE THAT CREATIVE FORCE BY TODAYS PHYSICS IS
246 IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE IT GOES COUNTER TO THE ENTROPHY THEORY.
247   WELL, ENOUGH OF THIS JUNK.  I SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY......
248 ***** CISTOP MIKEY BABELING ON AGAIN *** 3 JUN 83 *** 10:00PM *******
249 Who cares if we can't travel at nearly the speed of light? We really
250 don't want to anyhow. The equations (if they work at all, which obviously
251 hasn't been tested) only say the mass becomes something times the
252 square root of -1 when you go faster than light. The only trouble
253 exists at C, or near it. This is a problem only if to get to faster
254 we have to through C, and who says speed needs to be continous?
255 Every thing else isn't: they are quantized.
256 That square root of -1 isn't really that scary either, all electronics
257 people use it every day, or at least any time they deal with AC.
258 Edison beleived that AC was useless because the average current was 0.
259 Which is correct, but POWER is the product of the instantaneous current
260 times the voltage at the same time; since they each go negative at the
261 same time, it is always positive. (Unless there is phase shift, and then
262 that square root of minus 1 comes in) In any case Tesla was right, and
263 Edison wrong, so we use AC every day.
264 
265 More exotic physics: I read that a particle said to be the link that
266 carries the combination electromagnetic-weak nuclear force has been separated
267 out and detected. This required tremendous energy, and the particle
268 is very heavy. Would someone please explain how a very heavy particle
269 is the glue that hold together much lighter particles?
270 
271 Next question: once all of reality is described by one simple equation,
272 does this make reality any simpler?
273 >>> Don't be ridiculous, the equations for electromagnetic waves have
274 been around for some time, and there is still good money being made
275 designing radio antennas, because even if the equation applies, it
276 isn't obvious, or even visible how to apply it in other than the
277 simplest geometries.
278 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++B.A.D.++++++++++++++++
279 Maybe I shouldn't have read disc B.
280 The common belief that "I don't understand it, therefore it is not true."
281 is very wrong. The fact that many people believe something doesn't make
282 it true (or false either). Relativity is only a way to describe the world
283 we live in, more accurrately than say, Newtonian physics; but even these
284 are to complex for many people. The only way to find out if something is
285 true is to try it. For a description of a black hole, it may be hard to
286 do, because we haven't found one yet, at least not for sure & so we aren't
287 really sure what they look like, but unless our understanding of reality
288 is wrong they do exist, and we can make some pretty good guesses what 
289 they are like. We really do know a lot about reality. Although is can
290 be argued that all is illusion, this is a self defeating arguement, and 
291 we all act as if we understand our environment enough to keep our fingers
292 out of the fire, or out of in front of a moving car.
293 
294 In a Newtonian frame, the energy of a moving object is
295 E=1/2*M*V^2
296 If you move fast enough, the mass changes with the speed.
297 E=M*C^2 gives the energy in the rest mass of an object, or in fact, the
298 total energy o a moving one.
299 The possibility of travel near the speed of light is pretty small, even
300 if relativity is ignored (it can be until you get very close to c) simply
301 because of the energy involved.
302 You don't believe me? figure out the cost of electricity to accelerate
303 yourself (without any extra weight for space ship, food, air, etc) to
304 3/4 c. The add in the fact that it takes a car about 10 time your weight
305 to get you to only 55 mph, and extrapolate that weight to a spaceship
306 . .........................................................
307 Unless I made some simple error, it would cost only about $30 billion
308 for enough electricity to get me to 3/4 c. Using Newtonian rather than
309 the full Lorentz equation for energy gives about 2% error. Oh, by
310 the way, Eienstein isn't the only person who studied the effects of
311 traveling near the speed of light, he only tried to put together what
312 a lot of others already knew.
313 .......................:
314 B.A.D. asked how massive particles can be the 'glue' that holds together
315 smaller particles.  Well, in layman's terms, here goes.  Actually, the
316 Z-Zero particle discovered (at least announced) a few days ago carries
317 the weak force between particles.  This force is much less powerful
318 than the Strong Force, which is carried by (I believe) the Pi Meson,
319 and the electromagnetic force, which is carried by the photon.
320 	It turns out that a vacuum isn't really a vacuum, after all.
321 Such things as 'virtual particles' exist, which means that for an
322 instant (or slightly longer) a particle and an antiparticle come into
323 existance where nothing existed before, and usually annihilate them-
324 selves an instant afterwards.  Impossible, you say?  Not really, the
325 Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle allows this, if the uncertainty
326 in the mass (size of particle) multiplied by the time (length of
327 duration) doesn't exceed a particular amount.
328 	The more massive a particle is, the shorter a time it is likely
329 to exist, and less probable, too.  This means that heavy particles cause
330 weak forces, and light particles cause strong forces (very simplified
331 generalization).  
332 	The Weak Force is still stronger by a wide margin that gravitational
333 force, so the graviton, if it exists, should be discovered much later.

357 Ahh, At last you begin to think! Instead of monotoning your mantra
358 "It's impossible. It' impossible. It's impossible. It's impossible."
359 you are now looking at the possiblities of how you could do something
360 if you could take care of some aspect. This is how science advances.
361 I see someone out there is keeping up to date on the lastest happenings.
362 instead of quoting from text books out of college from 'a few years ago'.
363 (Which were probably a few more years older then that.) Bravo! At least
364 you maintain a true intestest in that which you discuse. I also see
365 that someone is looking at ways to get around anther part of the equation
366 which I had not discused. that being the speed of light constant. Making
367 the constant a variable I have to admit is an intestesting aproach.
368 I was begining to wonder if there was anyone left in this world who 
369 could think and question the existing of the world.

392    I am also a person that likes to find ways out of "impossible"
393 situations. But, I have a big question. Why doesn't the mass you
394 use up go flying out into space instead of attaching itself to

399 Ok you mental midgets and pea-brains.  If you can't understand
400 science that's ok with me, just don't spread nonsense about
401 your view of relativity around here.  Facts are facts, even
402 if you can't comprehend them.  Your agreement is totally 
403 unnecessary and pointless, and some day you will find that
404 out.
405 	You may feel a need to 'do the impossible.'  I do to,
406 except that I am capable of realizing when something is 
407 impossible because of physical laws, as opposed to it being
408 impossible simply because people say it's impossible.
409 	The whole discussion has been a 'tempest in a teapot' as
410 far as I'm concerned.  Until I hear some more accurate statements
411 being made concerning this subject, my opinion will not change.
412 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
413 I just saw the movie Wargames.  Ok, with a few exceptions.  How about a 
414 new discussion topic, common misrepresentations of computers in literature
415 (especially movies).
416 	In Wargames, the war simulation computer (WOPR) was portrayed like
417 the typical 1950's computer, with banks of lights flashing on and off.
418 	I ask you, since when have computers been built with long rows of
419 flashing lights?  True, many computers have very small front panels with
420 lights, but I don't know of anything built within the last 15 years that 
421 has a lot of lights.  Question:  So why are computers portrayed this way?
422 	Second, the idiots who wrote the movie found it necessary to give
423 the computer a synthesized voice.  Since when does any computer need a 
424 voice?  What was particularly stupid was the fact that the though the
425 voice was actually generated by the kid's Votrax (or whatever) the
426 voice showed up 500 miles from the guy's house.
427 	Unfortunately, movie producers don't realize (or perhaps they
428 do...) that a computer's appearance is usually quite boring (no
429 flashing lights or voice).  To us, the computer cognoscenti, this is
430 not surprising, but to someone trying to make a movie to appeal to 
431 the ignoramus masses, they have to embellish the truth.
432 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
433   You speak of 'physical laws' yet the theory of relativity is not
434 a 'law' if you look real close you will see the word 'theory' in the
435 phrase 'theory of relativity'. The reason that it is still a theory and
436 not a law is because it has not been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt
437 to be true, nor does it have other supportive laws for proof to lead it
438 to being a law. I would suggest you get your own facts straight sir.
439 I will stop with my blather in regard to relativity, as those who
440 would listen have, and those who would not still have not. It is a
441 shame though that there are those out there who refuse to consider
442 the impossible just because someone in authority says it is.
443 Despite the fact that the very theories they are holding so precariously
444 were obtained by questioning the impossible to begin with. -- sigh --
445  Authority: Someone other then yourself; The greater the distance
446 the greater the power of that authority. A quote from a friend of mine.

448 To whoever asked why computers are shown in the movies with flashing
449 lights: I think you answered it yourself, a black or blue box is dull.

451 Who blathers about something being a "theory" rather than "physical law"?
452 There is no diference. We see something, and guess about why it happened.
453 At first this is called a suggestion (or some such, there isn't any good
454 term for a first guess), then after it is a little better accepted, it
455 acquires the more high-faluting name of theory. (It helps to be hard
456 to understand if you want to be called a theory.) After a while, it is 
457 even better accepted and if noone complains to loudly it is called a
458 law of nature, or some such. The real difference between guess, theory,
459 and law is the gulibility of the speaker.
460 
461 For example:
462 For a long time it was known that the world was flat. (Maybe it curved up
463 a little at the edges) Every ones experince agreed with this, and no
464 experiments disproved it. It was true. ::: Time passed, and knowlege
465 incresased, including some things that implied the world was not flat.
466 <Ships slowly fading from view, the shadow on the moon during eclipse,etc>
467 It was then theorized that the Earth was round. Saying this was heretical,
468 thou, and dangerous at first, but it came to be truth. BUT, it is now
469 known that the Earth is not a sphere at all, but slightly flattened at the
470 poles, and somewhat pinched in the northern hemisphere. It even changes
471 with the tides....Truth never changed, but our perceptions did.
472 Now if something was ever true about the universe, it is still true today,
473 so how did the flat earth become round? It didn't. In fact, a flat earth
474 theory is a very good description of the world most of us live in, it is
475 only very rarely that we experince the curvature of the earth, and the
476 deviations from a sphere are very rarely important unless you are targeting
477 ICBM's. The flat earth is actually better: it is easier to visualize.
478 Of course the time may come when you need more accuracy, but it won't
479 affect a state road map, and when you need it, then accept that your 
480 earlier description was only an approximation, and use a better approx.
481 Eventually you will realize that all descriptions os reality, whether you
482 call them theories, laws, or whatever, are just approximations.
483 Hey, Mike, I can type almost as good as you, only about 1 typo per line.

485 Thanks for the stuff on the heavy particles.

487 Milady of dragons,
488    The project is complete. The words have now formed and they say that
489 one and a half of the kings inches do they hold. The words they shall
490 fly on the Monday here after and with hope they will soon to meet the
491 destination towards which they are bound.

493 Tron: Light does slow down when going thru any transparent medium
494 other than a vacuum. In fact the index of refraction is the ratio
495 of the speed in a vacuum to the speed in the substance (Ir=Sv/Ss)
496 Some interesting effects occur when a particle exceeds this
497 lowered speed of light. The speed of light that can't be exceeded
498 (we think) is the speed of light in a vacuum.
499    As to the mass increase, it doesn't come from the mass you
500 used up. It comes from the mere fact that you are travelling at
501 high speed. EVERYONE PLEASE NOTE!! Science is supposed to explain
502 what & how, NOT WHY!! Also, at high speeds YOU wouldn't think
503 YOUR mass had increased! YOU would think that the mass of the
504 rest of the universe had increased. There are some EXTREMELY
505 far-out suggestions that some of the braver physicists have made
506 that lead to many "impossible" things. All the talk about the 
507 flat earth makes me wonder how much history they know. The
508 GREEKS knew the earth was round (they even figured out a very
509 close value for the diameter). Proofs didn't really enter into
510 things until the late 1600s. In fact you could almost say that
511 "science" didn't exist until then. In any case, any new theory
512 has to include both Newtonian & Einsteinian physics as special
513 cases that apply to the areas in which they have been tested.
514 General relativity may not be totally correct but some things
515 it has predicted have been measured. One of the stranger ones
516 is the frequency shift in a laser beam traveling against the
517 earth's gravity. 
518 	On that bit about spinning masses & gravity, what I
519 THINK he may have been talking about is called "dragging the
520 metric". This is where a (VERY) massive object creates "gravity-
521 like" forces by (in effect) dragging the fabric of space-time
522 along with it when it moves. Some "anti-gravity" devices have
523 been designed using this effect (or a similar one predicted by
524 NEWTONIAN physics!). Unfortunately, you need something rather
525 denser than neutronium to build them. 
526 	Have you heard of the idea that the entire UNIVERSE
527 may be a black hole? The bigger the radius of a black hole
528 the less dense it needs to be.

530 p.s. to B.A.D. or Mikey (I forget which of you made the comment)
531 As far as can be told from what we know right now, questions
532 like "what if we kept the mass from increasing" are ALMOST in
533 the same league as "what if blue was red". Note I said "almost"
534 you would get a slightly better response if you said "what if
535 we could neutralize the mass increase". (There IS a difference,
536 one is like saying "what if gravity didn't exist" & the other is
537 "what if we could neutralize gravity". The difference between a
538 TOTALLY impossible premise & a THEORETICALLY impossible premise!)
539 As someone said "to successfully replace a modern scientific
540 theory, you must FIRST be an expert with the theory you wish to
541 replace"

543 Oh, wow.   MOVIE computers have flshing lights for the same reason that
544 explosins are big, loud, and exiting in movies. Not accurate, but fun.
545 Although, my pet peeve has always been the varying pitched beeps in most
546 low grade and some high grade movie computers.  That is, until I heard
547 the Ben Franklin computer.  For real, man: it BEEPS JUST LIKE THE MOVIES,
548 just not as loud.

550 Yup, yup, yup.
551      The siderial universe is a very complicated thingamabob and the descrip
552 tions we poor humans have come up with to keep track of what we see (or think
553 we see) are getting a might complicated.  It's about time a new genious 
554 arises to explain what the heck is going on!  Whatever replaces Einstein's 
555 theories as the best description of the universe we live in, will probabbly
556 not invalidate ol' Alberts rules of order.  It will just extend and (hope-
557 fully) simplify them.
558      From observation and Theory (capital T means the theory predicts) we
559 can be reasonably sure that you can't get past the light barrier with a
560 newtonian rocket ship.  Some other way is needed.  The only reason a
561 "Subspace Drive" or "Warp Drive" or "Transmat" can't be built today is
562 because we don't have the slightest idea how!  There doesn't seem to be 
563 any thearetical reason you can't do it except that not often mentioned
564 fly called "causality", which may have been fixed by a guy in a wheel-
565 chair in California.

570 For an interesting article on the subject of the origin of the universe,
571 check Discover mag, June issue, page 92.  It discusses the history back
572 to 10 e-43 seconds after Big Bang.  Including the idea of expanding space,
573 domain walls in the universe, Higgs fields, etc.
574 	And how about the article in Scientific American a few months ago
575 that considered the future of the universe, up to about the year 10 e100.
576 
577 	The Discover article suggests that the Universe is one big free
578 lunch, generated by a semirandom fluctuation of NOTHING.  I guess this 
579 means we are all figments of our own non-existant imagination, non-
580 existantly comtemplating each other's non-existance.  Heavy stuff.
581 Try it.  You'll probably not understand it, but you might like it.
582 --------------------------------
583 THE REASON FOR ALL THE CONFUSION ABOUT THEORIES IS THIS:  TO THE LAYMAN,
584 THE TERM THEORY SUGGESTS AN EXPLANATION WITH LITTLE OR NO PROOF,
585 GENERATED BEFORE ANY EXPERIMENTS.  WHILE TO A SCIENTIST, THEORY MEANS
586 AN EXPLANATION THAT IS BACKED UP ALREADY BY EXPERIMENT.  SO WHEN A 
587 SCIENTIST REFERS TO AN IDEA WHOSE CORRECTNESS IS NOT REALLY IN DOUBT,
588 HE CALLS IT A THEORY, WHICH IMPLIES TO THE LAYMAN THAT THIS IDEA
589 IS NOT VERY CERTAIN.
590 THE 'THEORY OF RELATIVITY' , AND FOR THAT MATTER MANY OTHER THEORIES, 
591 WILL BE CALLED BY THAT NAME LONG AFTER THEY ARE CONSIDERED CERTAIN
592 BY SCIENTISTS.  
593 UNFORTUNATELY, THIS CONFUSION IS SIEZED BY ANTI-SCIENCE OR
594 NON-SCIENCE QUACKS, WHO USE IT TO ARGUE THEIR PET IDEAS OF HOW
595 THE WORLD WORKS.  TRIVIA QUESTION:  HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD OF
596 J.W. ECKLIN?   IF YOU HAVE,  YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
597 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
598 AHH, I SEE YOU ARE STIL TRYING TO USE THE AUTHORITARIAN APPROACH TO
599 THE QUESTION. I.E. THIS GUY IS IMPORTANT, AND HE SAYS IT IS TRUE
600 THEREFOR IT IS! IT IS A SHAME YOU CAN'T THINK FOR YOURSELF.
601 .................................................................
602 I would have to disagree with you as to the general usage of the
603 term 'theory'. In general the theory is created to attempt to 
604 explain the results of the experiment in terms that the 
605 scientists who performed it can understand. 
606   The suggestion as B.A.D. indicated is what caused the experiment to
607 be done in the first place. The 'law' comes into play after the idea
608 has been kicking around under foot for so long that nobody has seriously
609 disagreed with it that it just drifts into being called a law rather then
610 theory. This however does not make it any more valid then befor. Remember
611 the law of gravity what goes up must come down is violated almost dayly 
612 by rockets sending things into earth orbit and beyond. 
613    Have you ever heard the answers given by a group of people
614 who saw some action? Its amazing the variety of answers that
615 are given. Scientists being human are not exempt from this either.
