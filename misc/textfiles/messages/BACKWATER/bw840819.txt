20 L'homme: Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner. I will get the disk
21 in question to you someway as soon as I can. Right now though I cann't
22 even read the archive disk as my 8inch system is currently emulating
23 a pile of parts on my living room floor. It is waiting for me to 
24 install some rf filters in it. (It seems my neighbors complained about
25 not being able to see channel two when I was using my computer. Sigh...
26 Since I have to have that particular computer running to read the wierd
27 archive disks (softsector formated hard sector disks) I am stuck until
28 I can get it into running condition again. I have to do something soon
29 though since I am running out of BW disks rather quickly, and I need to
30 archive them real soon or BW won't have any disks. I may have to patch
31 things together and do the upgrade at 3:00am in the morning if I don't
32 get the filters installed soon.

34 I hate to embroil myself in the political debate, but I am not impressed
35 by either party. The Democrats have shown an accute ability at
36 fiscal irresponsibility. While the Republicans have shown an
37 excellent ability at social irresponsiblity. I refuse to accept
38 one or the other at the sacrific of the other. Both MUST be 
39 balanced to operate the country properly. This means living 
40 within your budget, but without stepping all over people. It may
41 not be a popular view with some, but I feel that the rich have just
42 as much right to existing as do the poor. We all strive to improve
43 out lives and ourselves. There shouldn't be excessive restrictions
44 to prevent this, nor should there be excessive impounding of that
45 wealth once it is obtained. After all, consider what good is having
46 a million dollars if uncle comes along and takes away 90% of it?
47 What reason would anyone have for going after it in the first place?
48 By the very same nature, a poor person must be given the chance
49 to improve himself. Again, why bother to try if it is so hard to
50 do as to be impossible? Thus they continue to live off the rest 
51 of society. We need the rich to provide the oppertunity to others
52 to take the risks to grow. This is not something that can be forced
53 by regulations. It must be given freely or it will never work.
54 We must settup a structure where this is encouraged not forced.
55 All to often in this country we fall back on the old concept
56 that if you pass a law against it the problem will go away. Sorry
57 to say it doesn't work that way, yet we never seem to learn...
58 Nuff said... I think I'm going to vote for Mickey Mouse Since I
59 can't stand the thought of even considering voting for either
60 one of the jokers the two parties have hoisted on us this time.

63 To all the archivers : BAD NEWS! Yes...we (I) have run into a snag. It turns out that the Kaypro won't read LNW
64 CP/M. So what you say? Since it can't read LNW (Heath with Magnolia comes close), I must create 48 Kaypro disks on the
65 Kaypro, then take these to the LNW, and copy the 48 disks from the LNW format to the Kaypro format. In case you weren't
66 adding, that means it takes 96 disks to complete this little maneuver in one pass. I must them return to the Kaypro
67 to copy from Kaypro format to single sided IBM PC format, and then to the IBM for single sided format to double sided
68 format. Then comes the TRS80, but that's another story. What this all means is that there will be some delay in the
69 completion of the transfer. I will again relay my progress.
70 Mikey : thanks for the response. No big rush, but I thought I would let you know about the bad file. Hope you get the
71 problems fixed. One hint...try wrapping the cpu in tin foil. Works every time!
72 C.Y.M. : I must address your statement about this being the worst period in the last 30+ years. Do you really believe
73 we are at a morale and economic level that is below that of the 60's - Vietnam, Kent State, Assinations, Protests, etc?
74 Such broad statements as you made are usually dangerous, and come from the fingers of a very angry man. Has anyone
75 ever said to you, "Cool it"? Just curious...

78 All:I did something interesting recently. I went shopping for food. Nothing big,
79 I know, but I havn't done this for about a year now. I noticed that everyone
80 was in a massive hurry. Nobody had any consideration for the other person.
81 People would mash into others with carts and say "why didn't you get out of my way
82 instead of just standing there and looking dumb?" Thats a quote folks.
83 I noticed a few other things too. A big display of hearshy(sp) chocolate sauce 
84 on "sale" for 1.09 a can. In its normal place it cost 99 cents a can. Their
85 computer charged me 1.19 a can. After 15 miniuts of near constant bitching, they
86 told`me that the COMPUTER fouled up! I don't think that`those CRC checking scanners
87 are capable of something like that.
88 anyway, what I saw was a`bunch of people who didn't care about who they blamed 
89 something on, just so they could blame it on somebody else.
90 When I dropped out of high school, I wondered just what would happen to all of 
91 those jock types when they graduated. Also the A+ students.
92 
93 I find`in my morning paper that Troy Frischman helped murder a school principal.
94 he was a jock type at`my high school. I have seen many of the A+ types working
95 at local taco-grime and burger-things while thme rest went mostly into military
96 service. The 3 drop-outs I know are working right now, one is a long haul trucker
97 another is a car mechanic and I am the 3rd.
98 Something is wrong with the educational system! We are teaching the math/writing/reading aspect fine. More and more 
99 testing shows that. But we fail misserably in teaching kids how to be human beings.
100 and it is getting worse. I attended my sisters 5 year reunion, she graduated from
101 the same place I dropped out of. The people were careing and fun to be around.
102 They all agreed that the school had gone way down hill in quality.
103 Now 1 out of 18 highschool seniors use upwards of 1 gram of dope a day.
104 For those of you who don't know the relative amounts, a gram costs about 
105 10 bucks and would keep me high for a week. Kids under 12 commonly use drugs.
106 Todays schools place all of there values on performance in math/science and the like,
107 without realising what this is doing to todays kids. And what are they doing 
108 about it? school prayer! thats the answer to all our problems. I can't vote
109 for a shithead like reagan, I just can not. Big bussiness owns mondale.
110 I fully support the Phantom WriTTer for president-he would do better!
111 My, what a diatribe, I havn't been this long winded in weeks.

115 SHEESH. AND PEOPLE CALL "ME" CYNICAL. OH WELL---.
116 I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE CHOICE WE HAVE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION
117 EITHER, BUT AT LEAST WE 'HAVE' A 
118 CHOICE. [*=*] AKA DELTA FIVE, LYSIAS, THE PHANTOM PHILOSOPHER,AND GUEST
119 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
120    Although I don't find political arguments productive, I feel like I
121 would like to reply to the above --- sure we have a choice, but between
122 who or what?  We have a monolithic two-party system where the innies and
123 the outies trade places from time to time in public view after a brief
124 popularity contest while trading cash and influence during the rest of
125 their "careers".  By the time any person has gone through the system
126 of either party and has reached the point that they can run for public
127 office as the official representative of that party, they are morally and
128 tethically compromised to the point that they are unfit to hold the office.
129 They are, however, skilled at trading power, influence, and money -- often
130 not directly into their own pockets -- but often so.  I find it significant
131 that G. Ford (remember -- the guy nixon appointed after the famous nattering
132 nabob of negativity, your friend and mine, Spiro Who? was convicted of
133 being a politician)  had a net worth before being appointed VP of about
134 250K$.  After two years of trying to walk and chew gum at the same time,
135 he lost the quadrennial popularity contest and is now a multi-megabucks
136 guy.  Not bad for two years and a "get out of jail free" card huh?
137 I don't consider Nixon any worse than any other president we have had in
138 recent times -- just a little more stuipid and clumsy.  Rotten Ronnie
139 knows his lines better than our last republicrat, but has been bought and
140 paid for a long time ago.  The Demican's alternatives are no better than
141 the Republicrat's offerings.  I personally wish there was a space on the
142 ballot marked "none of the above".  I'll bet it would win most of the time.
143 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
144 ******************************************************************
145 A choice?! I'm sorry, but I don't consider choosing between Mr. Death
146 and Mr. Taxes as being a choice. Neither one has any real concern for 
147 either me or the country. Their own real concern is for their own
148 little power trips. Any concern for this country they might have that
149 I have seen was simply a side result of their power struggles.
150 A little strong perhaps, but as I said before, I am not at all
151 impressed by either one of the buffoons the political system has
152 thrown at us this time.
153 Piper: Thank you for the idea. Voting for noneoftheabove would be a
154 far better statment then Mickey. You have swayed my vote, and I shall
155 be voting for noneoftheabove. 
156 Now there is a thought, maybe we could get them to require that the
157 'none' option be provided so that when two totally unaceptable
158 choices as we have now are provided we can tell them sorry, no, try
159 again. Instead of being forced to decide between two twits. This
160 stupid lesser choice of evils garbage has gone on far too long, and
161 I think it has hurt the country more them it has helped it. The 'none'
162 choice would help since the politician would no longer get away with
163 being only just enough better then the other guy. He would actually 
164 have to be at least socially acceptable (If that's possible for a
165 politician!).

206      We can't believe some of the crap that has been floating through
207 this system lately.  All people do now is show how cleverly they can 
208 make logical arguemes, and pat themselves on the back for it.  Have
209 we forgotten that emotions are the most important part of our
210 personality?  When someone says " So an so scares me ", (s)he gets
211 scorned for not making a logical statement about policy and precedents.
212 I can not cater to thought without emotion, when our logic impresses
213 people more than nes personality.

217 MiG - On the last disk, you went for Unemployment Compensation,
218       on this disk you are working.  What gives.  Either you are
219       stealing from the government and all of us, or there has
220       been an error somewhere.  Please elaborate.
221 
222 MAX - I did not see anyone complaining to the point of not having
223       any alternatives.  Noneoftheabove was suggested as a candidate,
224       as was Mickey Mouse.  I did notice, however, that you did not
225       make any real constructive changes, just complaints.
226 
227 Mellow Man - The tides change, perhaps, but it is only a superficial and 
228              temporary change.  The real change is in the shoreline.  To
229              carry your analogy further, man is the shoreline, slowly
230              wearing down until something more powerful than the tides
231              cause the shore to rise up and change dramatically.
232              Even more importantly man can change the shoreline, as he
233              can change himself.  This change may be the result of a 
234              higher power, or the higher power may be mankind's collective
235              conciousness.  I do not know, but I am looking for an answer, 
236              hopefully it will be The Answer.

245 Andrew : I think you confuse being logical with being rational. Being
246 rational is not without emotion. The danger is in being emotional without
247 logic, or being logical without emotion. Swaying one way or the other
248 without moderation is dangerous, and I do NOT condone that. Being rational
249 is being moderate in all things.
250 L.F. : I enjoyed your continued anology. Your ending statement about the
251 Answer is interesting. I have found in my travels that many look for The
252 Answer. Those who find it, find it in themselves. Those who search far and
253 wide for The Answer often end up giving up the search, and it is then that
254 they find themselves. And within themselves, The Answer is found. Peaceful
255 co-existance is the way to go. I find this state impossible on BW, but maybe
256 elsewhere. The search goes on................Mellow Man

260   FROM HAWTHORNE:THE SUPERIORITY COMPLEX OF THE GODS?...
261   DEAR LORD!
262   EVEN THE WHINES AGAINST WHINES ARE NOTHING MORE THAN WHINES. A TOTAL LOSS OF CONSTRUCTIVE AND CREATIVE CRITICISM IS APPARENT
263 HERE.
264   LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO WHILE ON LINE TO SHOW YOU WHAT YOU'VE DRAGGED BLACKWATERS DOWN TO;
265   VOTING FOR GOV. NUNOF D. ABOVE WOULD BE A SHODDY THOUGHT OF A WEAK MIND.
266   BUT FOR INSTANCE THINKING OF A OLD NEWSTORY I SEEM TO REMEMBER THREE OTHER CANDIDATES ON 1984 PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTS.
267   WHAT WERE THEY? OH YES,MR.GLEN A MR.HART, AND A MR.JACKSON. I SEEM TO REMEMBER ALSO THAT I FAR PREFERRED GLEN TO ANYONE. AND
268 I DON'T THINK I'M ALONE.
269   MR.HART AND MR.JACKSON ARE TWO OTHER PEOPLE THAT I'M SURE HAVE THEIR SUPPORTERS AMONG US.
270   AFTER A VOTE IN WHICH HART, OR GLEN, AND ALMOST DEFINATELY MR. JACKSON GOT LARGE PERCENT VOTES I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
271 MIGHT LOSE ITSELF AFTER ALL ONE OR TWO MAJOR CANDIDATES TO WHAT IS THE THIRD LARGEST PARTY; THE AMERICAN INDENPENDANT PARTY.
272   AND THE LIBERARIAN AND AMERICN SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST PARTIES STILL CAN WITH ENOUGH SUPPORT; NOTE ENOUGH BEING A VERY LARGE
273 AMMOUNT GET PRESIDENTIAL BALLOT CONTENDERS.
274 
275   SOMEONE RECENTLY EXPRESSED AN OVERLY LARGE DISLIKE FOR WHAT IS TERMED ARMCHAIR POLITICIANS;
276   I SHARE THIS DISLIKE ONLY WHEN IT COMES TO BE SIMPLY PUT NUTIN BUT A DISCUSSION OF CYNICISM.
277   IDN'T THINK I'D SEE IT HERE ON A LARGE SCALE BUT I DID. AND IT DISGUSTS ME STRONGLY HERE.

279   MAN IN GRAY; DRUGS ARE COMMON UNDER TWELVE BUT NOT AS NEARLY  AS COMMON AS TWO YEARS AGO. AND I THINK IT'S A TREND.
280   LAISSAZ FAIRE; NOT BEING STUDY MINDED I DON'T KNOW FRENCH. MAY I ASK WHAT LAISSEZ FAIRE MEANS?
281   GO BACK AND TAKE A GOOD, LONG LOOK AT WHEN MIG SAID HE HAD TO GET TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE.

346 but as I said I don't have any faith in them as proper leaders.
347 And as I also said, if enough people were to do this, it would
348 force a reelection and hopefully a better choice. After all, I 
349 could just give up and follow the rest of the sheep and vote for 
350 'the winner' or an obvious 'losser' but what would be the point?
351 I would not be voting my convictions. Can you say the same?

363 (There is a HELP, but it merely gives a sub-menu; it doesn't tell what's
364 going on.
365 Mikey: Convictions are great things if you can afford them.  If you feel
366 that you would be better off by voting for nonoftheabove, and as a
367 result Mondull or Raygun gets elected, your honor will be satisfied.
368 However, what about your living conditions?  Life is a series of compromises
369 and few of us have the position or power to do what we really want to.
370 Granted, neither Mondale nor Reagan are all that exciting a choice,
371 but they are the only choices we have.  A vote for nonoftheabove is actually
372 a vote for Mondale or Reagan. (I'm not sure which it is, but one of the
373 parties benefits by low voter turnout.  That is where, in essence, your
374 vote would be going).  If you could get enough people (on the order of
375 several million) to vote for nonoftheabove, or some other third party,
376 it would be a different story.  As things stand now, though, you can either
377 vote for Mondull or you can vote for Raygun.  Actively or passively, that
378 is the result.  Sorry

382 I pursed my mouth and squunched up my eyes imitating Mike Wallace.  L'homme
383 was imitating George Carlin imitating my mom.  "If you don't quit that,
384 your face will freeze that way."
385 "These people are looney tunes," said Joshua, "We'd better find that girl.
386 I could blend in with the crowd if I wore green like everyone else."
387 "And I suppose if everyone else jumped off a cliff, you'd do that, too."
388 Joshua and I feigned acute nausea.  "no, I'd like to find her, too.  I
389 hope her name's Mary.  When I was a kid," L'homme went on, "I had a neat
390 model car that said on it..."
391 "Won't you come in."  The head Consul was thin, wiry, around 60.  His face
392 was composed and humorless except for his eyebrows which led an independent
393 bushy life of their own and looked as if they might fly off with his nose.
394 We were seated in a clean light study overlooking the commune and desert.
395 "Why does this religion arouse so much animosity in the general public?"
396 I began.
397 "As you are quite well aware, this is not a religion.  True spiritual en-
398 deavors do no demand money.  They demand sweat.  We fill another kind of
399 need.  The blind obedience you see here does not develop the personal disci-
400 pline necessary for contemplation of objects like this.  He held out an
401 ornately carved cinnabar disk depicting a writhing woman with flames shoot-
402 ing out of her head.  "The goddess Kali," said our host, "enraged that her
403 lover Vishnu will not make her queen of the skies."
404 "Well," smirked L'homme, "why should he buy the cow when he can milk her
405 through the fence?"
406 "This is a copy.  The real one was stolen.  We know your true background,
407 Ms Minsky.  Your religious expertise could help us find a motive and method
408 for the crime.
409 "We can be sure of one thing," said L'homme solemnly. "it didn't just get
410 up and walk away."

412 RAINdeer Oregon (AP)  British businessman John Basil Blackwell was shot here
413 today at a festival in honor of cult leader Rajneesh Dangerfield. A buyer
414 of Far Eastern antiques for the firm of Paddington-Chesney Ltd, he main-
415 tained residences in Hong-Kond, London, and New Delhi where, according to
416 the Hindustan Times, he has recently unearthed some rare Sikh relics.
417 His home office, unaware that he was in the U.S., declined to speculate
418 on a motive for the murder.  A spokesman for Dangerfield said that the 
419 guru deplored the incident.  The devotees of the guru are continuing their
420 celebration "to commemorate life, not death."  Attorney for the state
421 Groanmiser stated that a full investigation will be carried out.  "These
422 people will be granted no special considerations," he stated in a press
423 conference this evening.

426 Laissez Faire:Oops! I messed up. I was working at a rather well paying job 
427 after high school, I was, however, laid off. A breaf stint in a trailer park
428 has been the only employment after that. The statement is incorrect in that 
429 it should have stated that thease people were known to have been working
430 at said jobs after they dropped out. I know not what they do now, I should
431 check as this may invalidate a few statements. Tell me, do you have any 
432 atari disks to give to oft-lusted after female members of this board?
433 Voyeur:heck if I know! I talked to Michael and he said it was just a system
434 at the end of a phone line, it is NOT the new nerd. I have used it however 
435 and have a few suggestions. There is help everywhere, type a "?" at whatever
436 rove your at and it will spill fourth with data on how to use it. If that 
437 does not help, answer yes to "more help?" and you will get it. Oh yes, when 
438 entering a new leaf, ctrl-J will save it and get you out...
439 Hawthorn:I stopped teaching when I dropped out, so I have no comparison.
440 Could you quote somebody on this? It would be some hartening news in a see
441 of near constant bitching.
442 I forgot who it was, but somebody complaned that we are doing nothing.
443 I am planning something of a study in human nature soon, involving about 900
444 people in a set enviroment. In short, I am going back to high school to
445 play with peoples minds. Should be an interesting study, and it may help
446 me form methods I can use to better manipulate people that I need to control
447 like various public officials.

451 THE DARKNESS THAT I HAD WELCOMED STILL SURROUNDED ME AS SLOWLY 
452 I AWAKENED. THE EERIE STILLNESS AROUND ME WAS PUNCTUATED ONLY 
453 BY THE RHYTHMIC, DISTANT SOUNDS OF THE WAVES UOPN THE ROCKY 
454 SHORE. MORE AWAKE NOW, THE MEMORIES FLOODED MY TIRED MIND.OF 
455 THE--- OF WHERE I WAS, OF--THE MAP! THE PRECIOUS MAP! FRANTIC-
456 ALLY, I GROPED ABOUT IN THE INKY BLACKNESS BUT ONLY THE SLIPP-
457 ERY WET GRASS GREETED MY SEARCHING FINGERS. ALMOST WILD WITH 
458 PANIC, I THRASHED ABOUT, SEARCHING FOR MY RUCKSACK, FOR THE MAP
459 THE PRECIOUS MAP----. ONCE AGAIN, MY FATHERS WORDS ECHOED FROM 
460 OUT OF THE PAST, "YOU MUST NOT FAIL---".  AGAIN AND AGAIN, I
461  REACHED, AS IN THE DARKNESS, I COULD NOT SEE. DESPAIR OVER
462 WHELMED ME. THE MAP WAS LOST. I HAD FAILED. THE PEOPLE OF OUR 
463 LITTLE VILLAGE WERE DEPENDING ON ME, AND I HAD FAILED THEM.
464  I COULD NEVER GO BACK. I COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THEIR SAD
465 DOWNCAST FACES. I LAY THERE ALONE, AS ALONE AS ANYONE EVER WAS.
466  I TRIED DESPERATELY TO BANISH THE OVERWHELMING GUILT AND SAD
467 NESS FROM MY MIND. MY THOUGHTS RACED BACK IN TIME, TO THE 
468 VILLAGE. TO THE ELDERS, THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS, THE JOURNEY 
469 THAT HAD STARTED SO HOPEFUL, BUT THAT HAD LED ME HERE, TO SHAME
470 AND FAILURE, AND LONLINESS. THE STORM, MY POOR LITTLE COMPANION
471 LOST IN THE LAKE. OF BEING DASHED UPON THE ROCKY SHORE. IF ONLY
472 IT WERE A DREAM.IF ONLY I WOULD AWAKEN, AND EVERYTHING BE DIFF-
473 ERENT. PENSIVELY, I SAT UP, MY HANDS SQUISHING ON THE WET GRASS
474 --BUT--GRASS?? THE ROCKS. WHERE WERE THE ROCKS? HOW DID I-- AND
475 IN A TINY CORNER OF MY MIND, A SPARK OF HOPE WAS KINDLED. ANXIE
476 TY OVERCAME ME- HAD I SOMEHOW, IN MY FITFUL EXHAUSTED SLEEP, 
477 MANAGED TO CRAWL AWAY FROM THE ROCKS? HAD I, COULD HAVE I, LEFT
478 THE RUCKSACK BEHIND ON THE ROCKS? COULD IT STILL BE THERE? AS I
479 PONDERED THIS, I BECAME AWARE OF SOMETHING ELSE, VAGUE AT FIRST
480 , BUT SO OVERCOME WITH CONFLICTING EMOTIONS I COULD NOT THINK. 
481 I FORCED MYSELF TO "REMEMBER MY STAR", AS THE VILLAGE ELDERS 
482 HAD TAUGHT ME. "REMEMBER YOUR STAR, AND IN YOUR MOMENTS OF TRIB
483 ULATION, IT WILL COMFORT YOU AND GUIDE YOU---" MY SENSES BECAME
484 CLEARER AS MY MIND CALMED. SMOKE! IT WAS SMOKE! BUT HOW? I LOOK
485 ED BEHIND ME. YES! THERE IT WAS, THE GLOWING EMBERS OF A CAMP
486 FIRE. I CRAWLED TOWARD THE DULL REDNESS, TOO WEARY TO STAND, 
487 AND AS I NEARED IT, I IMAGINED A FAMILLIAR SIGHT ---MY GOD!?- 
488 IT WAS MY LITTLE TENT-MY TENT! BUT HOW? HOW COULD THIS BE? WITH
489 AN ENERGY BORNE OF SUDDEN EXHILARATION, I SCRAMBLED INSIDE. MY 
490 HEART WAS POUNDING SO FRANTICALLY MY HEAD WAS POUNDING, AND--
491 THERE-THERE ITWAS, THE RUCKSACK. THE MAP! I REACHED OUT FOR IT.
492 FELT IT. IT WAS REAL!. I WASN'T DREAMING. AS I THREW MY ARMS 
493 AROUND IT, I DRIFTED OFF INTO A PEACEFUL SLEEP, IMAGINING THAT 
494 I HEARD A SMALL SNEEZE THERE NEAR ME. TEARS FILLED MY EYES AND 
495 THE BLACKNESS ENGULFED ME---. TO BE CONTINUED. [*=*][*=*][*=*]

497   Mikey -- seems there are a lot of folks who resent us not
498 falling into line and swallowing the choices that have been made for us.
499 There can be many reasons for this, but the most likely is the person
500 him(her)self either not knowing enough about her(his) motives in voting
501 for one or the other of the national party figureheads or feels that there
502 is, indeed, a substantiative difference between the two.  I am and have 
503 been for most of my life a registered Republican.  After the stances the
504 party took on its platform, I will not support it during the coming election.
505 I consider myself a moderate, and there is no room left for me in the
506 republican party.  Unfortunately, here I have no choice, as the dems are
507 no more near my own philosophy.  When the election rolls around, my votes
508 will generally go against the incumbent or republican unless I have reason
509 to vote otherwise.
510    Perhaps we should start an initiative to add noneoftheabove to our
511 present ballots.  Some practical questions immediately rise -- can we
512 afford continuing circusus when the same tired old nominees repeat their 
513 rounds?   Seriously, however, these questions can be answered.
514   By placing "none of the above" as a true option on the presidential ballot,
515 the state of Oregon would be the first to quatify the present protest
516 vote.  Since we do not really elect a president we can mandate that our
517 members of the electoral college cast the state's vote to match the popular
518 vote, and withold the number of electoral college votes to match the
519 percentage of nonoftheabove votes.  This procedure would, at least, serve
520 notice to the "winners by a landslide" of the amount of distrust in
521 which they are held.  Anyone care to work on this idea further?

531 There are no "set dicisions", everyone has the right to dicid
532 themselves.  What you can change is beyond me.  You have the freedom
533 of choice.  There might be a few people that say "YOU MUST VOTE DEMO-
534 CRATIC!!!!" but you don't have to do that do you?  You can vote whatever
535 you like, or even not vote at all.  Vote for Mickey Mouse if you want to,
536 it's hardly going to change anything now is it?  The votes are in the
537 hands of the big wealthy slobs that have a great influence over a lot
538 of people.  Thats were the deciding vote lie.  In these "landslides",
539 and also, by the time you get to the poles the winner will already be
540 anounced and living it up on the east cost.  What will you vote, you
541 might still vote.  But what will your vote be worth?  Who would care?

543 ***************************************************************
544 VOYEUR: I VERY STRONGLY DISAGREE THAT A VOTE FOR NONEOFTHEABOVE WOULD
545 BE A VOTE FOR MONDALE OR REAGAN. AS I SAID, SURE MY VOTE MAY NOT MEAN
546 MUCH, BUT IT IS BETTER THEN NOT VOTING AT ALL, AND I ABOSOLUTLY REFUSE
547 TO ACCEPT EITHER ONE AS A 'RESPONSABLE' LEADER. BUT, IF ENOUGH PEOPLE
548 WERE TO VOTE MY WAY, THE PARTIES WOULD HAVE TO SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE.
549 THAT MAYBE PEOPLE DON'T WANT THESE TWO IN OFFICE.
550 MAYBE YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE SHEEP AND
551 VOTE FOR ONE OF THE PREORDANDED CHOICES, BUT I REFUSE TO COMPROMISE
552 MY MORALS TO SATISFY THOSE WHO WOULD NOT STRIVE TO FIND SOMETHING
553 BETTER. HOW CAN I BE TRUE TO MYSELF IF I DON'T VOTE MY CONVICTIONS?
554 THERE ARE THOSE WHO TALK HERE ABOUT NOONE DOING ANYTHING, ONLY 
555 COMPLAINING. TO A LARGE EXTENT I WOULD AGREE, BUT ONE THING I HAVE
556 LEARNED IN THIS SHORT TIME I HAVE BEEN KICKING AROUND IN THIS WORLD
557 IS THAT I YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING DONE YOU START BY TAKING THE
558 FIRST STEP. MY VOTE FOR NONEOFTHEABOVE MAY NOT BE A VERY LARGE STEP,
559 BUT IT IS ONE JUST THE SAME. IT IS MY WAY OF DOING SOMETHING ABOUT
560 THE SITUATION. WILL YOU STANDUP FOR YOUR CONVICTIONS? OR WILL YOU
561 FOLLOW THE HERD LIKE EVERYONE ELSE AND CHOOSE THE 'LESSER OF TWO
562 EVILS' INSTEAD OF FIGHTING FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE RIGHT?
563 ************************ CISTOP MIKEY *******************************:
564 GOOD POINT MIKE! NONE OF THE CANDIDATES ARE ACCEPTABLE. JACKSON WOULD BE A
565 LITERAL TIME BOMB. AS PEOPLE HAVE SAID BEFORE, RELIGION AND POLITICS DO NOT
566 MIX.
567 REAGAN IS NOT A RESPONSIBLE LEADER AND FRITZ IS THE PUPPET OF SPECIAL INTERESTS
568 GARY HART IS NOT EXACTLY A GOOD CHOICE EITHER.
569 THE THING THAT REALLY TICKS ME OFF IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS MEDDLING IN 
570 THINGS THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO MEDDLE IN. FOR EXAMPLE, RELIGIOUS INTERESTS
571 (NO OFFENSE) HAVE GONE AHEAD AND TRIED TO LEGISLATE MORALITY INTO THE LAWS.
572 THE PROSTITUTION AND ANTI-PORNOGRAPHY MOVEMENTS ARE SUCH MOVES TO LEGISLATE
573 SOMETHING UNDEFINEABLE AND HAVING TO DO WITH MORALITY. THEY ARE TRYING TO FORCE
574 THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO CONFORM TO THEIR RELIGIOUS TENETS AND ELIMINATE
575 COMPETITION.(I.E. THE BIGAMY LAWS AND THE MORMONS)
576 I SAY THAT ENOUGH HAS HAPPENED THIS WAY. WE SHOULD ELECT THE ATHEISTS WHO 
577 HAVE A CLEARER VIEW OF THE WORLD AND WILL CLEAR UP THE LAWS LEGISLATING MOR-
578 ALITY..........
579 
580 THE CARD-CARRYING ANARCHIST AND ATHEIST,
581 THE UNBELIEVER
582 ********************************************************************************
583 EXCEPT FOR THE ELECTORAL VOTE SYSTEM, ONE VOTE (OR NON VOTE)
584 COUNTS THE SAME AS ANY OTHER, NO MATTER HOW MANY CADILLACS OR
585 8" DISC  DRIVES YOU HAVE. ATHEISM IS DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED
586 TO THEISM. BOTH ARE DOGMA. THE ONLY REALISTIC LOGICAL SYSTEM OF 
587 BELIEF IS DEISM, OR AGNOSTICISM. [*=*]
