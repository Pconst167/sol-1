5 GENERAL DISCLAIMER: BWMS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INFORMATION

7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privately owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system. As the system is
10 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
11 I may find offensive. Because of the limited size of the system, it will be
12 periodically purged of messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
13 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out of the
14 ENTER mode. The message is automatically stored. If after entering the

20 PARITYLESS PERSON: NO, COPYLINK DOES NOT EMULATE ANYTHING, IT GOES STRAIGHT
21 THRU TO THE SYSTEM, SO IF YOU SYSTEM HAPPENS TO EMULATE SOMETHING, IT WIL
22 USE THAT. THE CPM EMULATOR PROGRAM IS ENTIRLY SOFTWARE, AND OPERATES
23 COMPLETELY THRU THE OPERATING SYSTEM. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO INTERRUPT
24 CALLS THAT SEEM TO HAVE BECOME STANDARDIZED IN MOST MSDOS SYSTEMS THESE
25 DAYS (EVEN THE SANYO PC HAS THEM!) THESE ARE INT 14 (RS232) AND INT 10
26 (SCREEN CONTROL). THE CPeMULATOR (AS IT IS CALLED) EMULATES A KAYPRO LIKE
27 99
28 RUNNING ON AN IBM PC, SO WE KNOW IT WORKS OK THERE. ONE THING I MIGHT WARN
29 YOU OF THOUGH, IT CAN'T RUN MACHINE DEPENDANT CODE. ALSO CERTAIN CPM 
30 DEPENDANT FUNCTIONS ARE EITHER IGNORED OR PROVIDED IN A WAY THAT KEEPS
31 SAFE THOUGH THE INFO MAY BE WRONG. SUCH THINGS LIKE THE USER FUNCTION
32 OR SET DRIVE READ ONLY ARE SIMPLY IGNORED SINCE MSDOS DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
33 THAT SORT OF THING. OTHER THINGS LIKE RETURN ADDRESS OF THE ALLOCATION MAP
34 WILL RETURN AN ADDRESS OF A TABLE OF ZEROS AS THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO 
35 PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF INFO ON AN MSDOS SYSTEM. (IT CAN BE DONE, BUT IT 
36 TAKE A LOT OF TIME AND WORK TO DECODE AND THEN REENCODE THE INFORMATION.)
37 SINCE ALL CALLS ARE PERFORMED THRU THE SYSTEM, IT WILL MAKE USE OF WHAT
38 EVER YOU HAVE DEFINED AS PART OF THE SYSTEM ASSUMING THE CPM PROGRAM 
39 KNOWS HOW AS WELL. THE PRINT FUNCTION GOES THRU THE SYSTEM AS WELL, SO 
40 I DON'T SEE WHY THE SPOLLER WOULDN'T WORK, AND THE RAM DISK IS JUST ANOTHER
41 DISK AS FAR AS THE SYSTEM IS CONCERNED. THE CPeMULATOR RUNS ON MSDOS 
42 FORMAT DISKS CURRENTLY IT CAN ONLY READ KAYPRO TYPE DISKS. IF THERE IS 
43 ENOUGH DEMAND, WE WILL BE ADDING OTHER FORMAT READ CAPABILITIES. ALL IT
44 DOES IS TRANSFER THE CPM PROGRAM TO THE MSDOS FORMAT SO THAT IT CAN BE
45 RUN BY THE CPeMULATOR. OF COURSE YOU CAN USE COPYLINK OR SOME OTHER 
46 TRANSFER PROGRAM TO GET IT THERE AS WELL.

51   Morby, not realizing if the nasties were at the Inn, quickly drew his old 
52 battered short sword, and valiantly looked for a tree to hide in.

82 fellow who pointed out the DB command - Thanx.        Morby
83 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
84   From his vantage point in the tree, Morby could see two of the ants moving
85 in his direction.  They stood upright, and carried two of both swords and
86 shields, and wore light armour.  Morby hoped that the others at the Inn could
87 deal with the other ants.
88   The two stoped right under his hiding space in the tree without noticing
89 him.  The smaller of the two seemed to take commands from the larger, and then
90 it ran off to the main group.
91   " It is good to be back in the swing of things " Morby thought to himself.
92   Then with a grin on his face, he seized the moment and dropped from the tree
93 onto the back of the ant.  The old sword dug deeply into the creatures back,
94 and it collasped in a heap.
95   Morby felt the hair on the back of his head stand up, and he spun to meet
96 the smaller ant, who had returned.  Realizing that all his element of surprise
97 had been lost, he attacked without hesitation.  He parried with the ant, and
98 then made a mighty blow, but it eas deflected easily by the ant, and Morby's
99 shord shord shattered.  Morby watched in stunned disbelief as the shards 
100 dropped to the earth.
101   " Oh damn.. ", he remarked casually.
102   He didn't fell that dying a quarter of a mile away from the Inn was very
103 fitting, or at any distance for that matter.  
104   The ant regained composure, and advanced....

107 "Do you think that #152 is too easy on him?", The Doctor asked.  "No, definitely not.  He'll regret his evil deeds..."

109 Inside the Danger Room, the man in the robes turned to the Black Guardian.  "I should really just destroy you once 
110 and for all, but I have a kind heart.  Tell me, Where is the Key of Time?"
111 The Black Guardian begins to say something ("nev..") when he suddenly realizes that the man in the room is 
112 translucent.  "You are not real, I do not believe in you!"  The man looks about himself, sees what he means, and 
113 begins to darken in, as if the illusion was becoming real.  "How silly of me... to remain ethereal.  You do not 
114 believe?  Well then, upon threat of Spiritwrack I command thee to tell me the location of The Key of Time!  Dimat 
115 so decrees!"  As the man speaks, the air in the room grows hot, and a breeze stirs in the chamber.  "No...you can't
116 be real!"  "Am I not?  Then feel the pain!"  A scroll of vellum appears before the man, and he begins chanting, 
117 reading from the parchement a spell to induce pain.  The words off the vellum glow and fade as they are spoken, and 
118 with a clap of thunder, it is done.  The Black Guardian is now on the floor, writhing in pain.  "I'll tell!  I'll 
119 tell!  It's..."  As the Guardian speaks, he and the man disappear in torrents of silver flame.
120 Inside the control room, the Doctor asks, "Don't you think you went a little far with the simulation?  Where did 
121 they go?"
122 Milchar turns from the console, his face white.  "I don't know where they went, but the simulation hasn't been 
123 running for the past three minutes."
124 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Milchar & The Doctor +++++++++
125 ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
126 Note to Milchar:  Cute, real cute!!!!  You had to do it, didn't you?!?!?!?!?
127 ??????????
128   The Doctor whips around to face Milchar.  "Say What???  Didn't you key the 
129 simulation?"  "I did, but for some reason, after about 2 minutes it shut off."
130 The Doctor then turns to the consol and sets the scanner for inside the Tardis.
131 "Let's see now...There's Psycho and Gizmo in the Gameroom...Milch, there's no
132 sign at all!!!  That was really him...!"
133 The Doctor and Milchar stand silently until a strange voice and familiar form
134 appears in front of them.  #Milchar and Doctor, you two are my prize pupils...
135 but I cannot let you 'fry' this man like this.  Yes, I did turn off the 
136 simulation the moment that he said that he knew that the illusion was not real.
137 I apologize to you for doing this, but I want to have fun, too!!!  He has told
138 me where to find this Key to Time that you two search for...I will tell you if
139 you will agree to 'pick up' a small item for me..."  The Doctor and Milchar 
140 stare at each other for a moment, then the Doctor says "Mighty Dimat, we have
141 learned from you, fought by your side, etc.  Your wisdom is great, as is your
142 sense of humor, if this is no joke-then you only have to ask.  We will do it."
143 "Great, this item is on Galifrey, The Doctor's home planet.  I need for you two
144 to get the Lord President's Septre."  "Surely you jest!!!  The Septre of 
145 Galifrey is as well protected as the President himself.  How can we, a Renegade
146 Time Lord, two aliens, and a Magician possibly be able to defeat the President's
147 Guards??"  #You will find a way...#  With that, Dimat vanishes.  "Well., Milch.
148 What are we gonna do??"  "I've got a plan, Doctor..."

188 as the ant was advancing on Lord Morby an arrow struck its exo-skeloton

191 feet, "i hope you are skilled with it, it was the only thing i could find in my

193 the thing fell over dead.a large party of ants,probbly about 20 was breaking 
194 away from the main body, wich pheric estimated was about 150-200. "i suggest we

218 I guess he just wanted to take it all out on somebody,because I warned him of`what he was doing wrong,

228 It may be true that there are two sides to every 
229 question, but it is also true that there are two 
230 sides to a sheet of flypaper and it makes a big 
231 difference to the fly which side he chooses.
232 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
233 Sometimes the best way to convince a man he is wrong 
234 is to let him have his own way.
235 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
236 There are two kinds of failures: the man who will do 
237 nothing he is told, and the man who will do nothing 
238 else.
239 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
240 Consider how hard it is to change yourself and you'll 
241 understand what little chance you have of trying to 
242 change others.
243 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
244 The practical man is the man who knows how to get 
245 what he wants. The philosopher is the man who knows 
246 what man ought to want. The ideal man is the man who 
247 knows how to get what he ought to want.
248 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
249 If you think you're confused, consider poor Columbus. 
250 He didn't know where he was going. When he got there, 
251 he didn't know where he was. And when he got back, he 
252 didn't know where he'd been.
253 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
254 Tact is the knack of making a point without making an 
255 enemy.
256 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
257 One day, the story goes, a man picked up a hairpin. 
258 He played with it thoughtfully for a moment, 
259 wondering if he could give the wire a new twist that 
260 would add to its usefulness. He bent it several ways, 
261 then stopped when the shape he had arrived at seemed 
262 interesting. He had no way of knowing it then, but he 
263 had just invented the paper clip. The invention, 
264 which took only a few minutes, netted him, so they 
265 say, a quarter of a million dollars.

267 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
268 I believe in the supreme worth of the individual and 
269 in his right to life, liberty, and pursuit of 
270 happiness.
271 i believe that every right implies a responsibility; 
272 every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a 
273 duty.
274 I believe that the law was made for man and not man 
275 for the law; that government id the servant of the 
276 people and not their master.
277 I believe in the dignity of labor, whether with head 
278 or hand; that the world owes no man a living, but 
279 that it owes every man an opportunity to make a 
280 living.
281 I believe that thrift is essential to well ordered 
282 living and that economy is a prime requisite of a 
283 sound financial structure, whether in government, 
284 business, or personal affairs.
285 I believe that truth and justice are fundamental to 
286 an enduring social order.
287 I believe in the sacredness of a promise, that a 
288 man's word should be as good as his bond; that 
289 character - not wealth or power or position - is of 
290 supreme worth.
291 I believe that the rendering of useful service is the 
292 common duty of mankind and that only in the purifying 
293 fire of sacrifice is the dross of selfishness 
294 consumed and the greatness of the human soul set 
295 free.
296 I believe in an all-wise and all-loving God, named by 
297 whatever name, and that the individual's highest 
298 fulfillment, greatest happiness, and widest 
299 usefulness are to be found in living in harmony with 
300 His will.
301 I believe that love is the greatest thing in the 
302 world; that it alone can overcome hate; that right 
303 can and will triumph over might.

366 shtoner: PorSFiS is the Portland Science Fiction Society.  It seems to have
367 turned into an unofficial gathering place for Backwater Innhabitants.
368 The bard and apprentice were originally there because they are members of
369 PorSFiS.  I dropped in one time while looking for The Friends of the Doctor,
370 and discovered them. MiG arrived there, I believe, as a result of a BW contact
371 with the bard. With that small group, we thought it might be interesting to
372 see who else we could con into appearing, thereby meeting the faces
373 behind the pseudonyms.  Others have dropped in from time to time, such
374 as piper (he really does play pipes!), The Mad Actor, bo, Fast Fred,
375 Traveller, Milchar, The Doctor, L'homme sans parity, HAWTHORNE, DREAMTOUCHER,
376 and others who I cannot recall at the moment because my fan blew my
377 list of pseudonyms/identities behind my desk where I can't get it easily.
378 The core group tends to be the bard, apprentice, voyeur, and MiG, with semi-
379 regular appearance by L'homme, TMA, and the other Sysop for the Nerd.
380 The PorSFiS meeting is every other Saturday (next one is 6/2) at the Multnomah
381 County Library, main floor, at 2:00 PM, running 'til about 3:30, at which
382 time it adjourns to the PC&S Tavern nearby, (where our under-age members never
383 seem to have any problems). (hope no OLCC spies are reading this!).
384 It's rather interesting to find out how wildly ones impressions of the people
385 differ from reality.
386 	Hope this helps to explain what 'porsfis' is?

390      Waking up with a start, I find the sun shinning down melting 
391 the snow.   Another drop falls on my head,  and I realize that it 
392 was  what caused me to wake.
393      The fire had gone out sometime in the night, and now a small 
394 stream was running through the small depression where I had  made 
395 it.   The sun was beating down, it was a beautiful day.  I should 
396 be  happy,  yet  I  find I am not.   
397      I  have tryed to outrun my depression,  but all I seem to do 
398 is just tire it.  The minute I stop it once more catches up to me 
399 blotting out the sun and turning the world gray about me.  
400      The  snow  has turned to a dirty white/brown  patch  on  the 
401 ground.  Its essence running away to the sea.   Rushing to escape 
402 itself as I have tryed.   Yet it will be back once again,  caught 
403 up in the wind to be deposited yet again where it lay.  
404      Another  dirty  drop splashes upon my head as if  to  refute 
405 these thoughts.   I get up to move from under this intrusion upon 
406 my  comfort,  and  a moment later a rush of dirty snow  rock  and 
407 water  fills the ground where I had lain,  washing the remains of 
408 my campfire away. "The story of my life!" I grumble.  
409      Since  I was up,  there was no point in sticking around  any 
410 more,  I would move on and find a more suitable place to break my 
411 fast.  Moving further up the hill, I find a group of bolders near 
412 a  flat  piece of gravel strewn ground.   There also I  find  the 
413 remains of anothers fire.   Adding some fresh wood,  I restart it 
414 and prepare my late breakfast.  
415      After I am done,  not finding any water close at hand to put 
416 out the fire,  I pickup some of the dirty snow and spread it over 
417 the  fire which quickly puts it out.   Turning to face  the  peak 
418 again,  I  look  upon it and see naught but the task at  hand  of 
419 finding Emer. 
420      "Ahh,  Emer,  I  fear that my dark cloud has chased you  off 
421 once again.   I wish I knew what to do to combat this, for I very 
422 much  want to see you."  Not knowing what else to do,  I continue 
423 to  trudge up the moutain side.   After a moments pause as if  it 
424 were  confused,  the  dark cloud that still follows me  moved  to 
425 catch up once again.
426                           *O* Tarn *O*

430   Walking down the pathway, the piper's boots kicked up a sparkilng galaxy of
431 failed hopes, dreams, and realities.  An occasional mote would fly up as hig
432 as his eyes; one or two bringing a tear to his eye and a lump to his throat.
433   He was coming to a more used section of the path now.  A large bipedal life-
434 form rushed by, its elongated auditory apparatus pushed back by the relative
435 wind of its passage, lamenting audibly about its chronological problems.  The
436 piper paused a moment, turned and watched the retreating rabbit, then resumed
437 his journey.  Coming toward him was a creature that resembled nothing so muh
438 as an enourmous lavender slug.  Its antennae protruded nearly two feet from its
439 four-foot high body, and a thick smell of peppermint filled the air as the piper
440 moved well to the side of the path as it passed.  The inch-thick coating of 
441 slime the creature left on the path made the footing treacherous for some time
442 thereafter.  Still the piper searched for the destination that eluded him.

453 IS NOT FROM AN EXISTING STORY (AS FAR AS I KNOW) BUT WAS, EXCEPT
454 FOR THE PARTICULAR VEHICULE AND OCCUPANTS, AN ACTUAL DREAM I EXPERIENCED

463   AS SOON AS THEY GOT THE CAR TO THE CURB, SNOWRUNNER JUMPED OUT AND RAN BEHIND 
464 THE NEAREST BUSH.  A SHORT WHILE LATER, AS WE CONSULTED IN CONSTERNATION, SHE
465 RETURNED.  SHE CHAISED HER TAIL LIKE A PUPPY FOR A FEW TURNS THEN CAME OVER
466 WIMPERING.  
467   "#I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.  SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PLACE DOESN'T FEEL
468 QUITE RIGHT TO ME EITHER#"
469   IT WAS LATE AFTERNOON AND IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WOULD HALVE TO FIND A PLACE TO
470 CAMP FOR THE NIGHT.  THE EDGE OF THE GHOST CITY WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO WALK IT
471 BEFORE DARK.  FORTUNATLY THEY HAD A GOOD SUPPLY OF LIGHTS WHICH 
472 DREAMTOUCHER MARVELED AT, AND BLANKETS ET.C.  IT WAS MOSTLY A MATER OF
473 FINDING A SUITABLE PLACE FOR THE NIGHT UNLESS BARD COULD FIND A WAY TO GET HIS 
474 FIELD GENERATOR TO SHIFT THEM OVER A FEW MORE LINES ON WHAT FUMES REMAINED 
475 IN THE CARBURATOR OR THEY COULD LOCATE A SOURCE OF FUEL.  PROBABLY BOTH WOULD
476 BETTER DONE IN THE MORNING LIGHT OF A NEW DAY THAN IN THE FAIDING LIGHT OF
477 EVENING.

479 Lord Morby: I correct your spelling for two reasons-
480 1. because I've seen so much bad spelling on the BBS's that I'm starting tohave
481 trouble with my OWN spelling!
482 2. Some of your mis-spellings are the correct spelling for a different word! 
483 This sort of thing can ruin the intended meaning of a sentence!
484 The latest example was when you spelled "feel" as "fell"!

486 	The apprentice rushed towards the sounds of battle. When he arrived,
487 he found the bodies of two VERY large ants. After inquiring as to just WHAT
488 exactly had happened, he consulted with whisper.
489 	The consultation finished, he removed a scroll from a case on his
490 belt. There was a shimmer in the air as he began to read...
491 	Shortly, the shimmer solidified into an ant lion of proportionate size 
492 to the ants. The apprentice gestured towards the woods and it departed.

498 Voyeur & L'homme: I suspect that dreamtoucher's station was the next fuel stop

501 ATTENTION TMA/GAIUS!
502 	Billy Bob awoke slowly. The first thing he noticed was the stench.
503 The second was the rock in his hand. He dropped the rock and struggled to his 
504 feet.
505 	The last thing he remebered was singing that stupid song...
506 Now he seemed to be standing in the world's biggest dungheap. Well, at least 
507 that explained the stench! Somehow he knew that the darkness around him was NOT
508 going to lift. 
509 	He picked a direction and started walking...

513 Dreamtoucher: I saw the line disappear too! Somehow you'd gotten an ESC in your 
514 entry. (I took the liberty of removing it!). You might try using CC N & seeing 
515 how things look.

518 Bard: poor RZ is going to sue us for plagarism pretty soon.
519       Good 'service station' compromise.  I'll have to ponder for a while,
520       see what I can come up with (if anything).
521       I also aint got no 'World of the Imperium' Laumers.  Other than
522 the Retiefs, just Plague of Demons, Earthblood, World Shuffler, & Timetracks.
523        If all else fails, I suppose we could improvise (what? originality?)

526 bARD: Yes...good compromise. The question is, if we DID get filled up at
527 Reality 76, how did we run out of gas so soon? Is this due to another
528 difference in realities? My gas mileage isn't great, but it is NOT that bad!
529 Anyway...I'll just go along with the story line set by Dream Toucher...(funny,
530 oh...never mind)...While I steered the car, the others got out and pushed the
531 car from behind (one of the pleasures you get for owning the car!). Finally
532 we rolled up to what looked like a suitable place to stop. "Are you guys
533 tired? We didn't fo THAT far did we?" The look in their eyes told me not to
534 push the subject...We set about setting up some kind of camp, in the hopes
535 we could figure out what had happened to the city in the morning...

539 That night, while sitting around their campfire and eating tasteless rations
540 from their packs, supplemented with freshly caught game (courtesy of Snowrunner), the bard
541 explained the history of the place they were in, and the disapperance
542 of the Dragons of Bel'kwinith. (go ahead, bard.  That's more up your
543 alley than mine {if you want, anyway}).  Finally, having decided nothing
544 of consequence regarding their plight, they turned in.
545 	Early the next morning, they were awakened by an eerie wailing.
546 The bard looked puzzled, voyeur and L'homme had no idea what it might be,
547 and disturbingly, Snowrunner was covering her ears and cowering against 
548 Dreamtoucher.  The sound grew nearer, and the group began to prepare for
549 battle against the unknown.  Who knew what might lurk in these desolate woods?
550 As he waited for IT to appear, something nagged in the back of voyeur's mind.
551 That sound was vaguely familiar.  Wait!  Could it be---bagpipes?
552 If so, perhaps they had a way out of here after all!

560   The piper walked slowly along the shining path, wishing that his journey
561 was over.  How he longed to sit at his old table at the inn, trading songs
562 with the bard, sipping the delicious brew that could be found nowhere else.
563   As he walked, he scanned the atmoshphere before him.  With concentration,
564 he could discern traces of many who had passed this way.  What was this?
565 Something was familiar about those lines.  It couldn't be -- powered
566 vehicles could not walk the path -- but something very similar -- now how
567 to escape this meta-reality?  Slowly he unwrapped his pipes from their
568 cover, slid the ferrule of the bass drone onto the stem, and set the slide
569 to the approximate position.  Raising the pipes to his shoulder he blew,
570 then winced.  Moving the drone, he stopped the outside tenor, tuned it,
571 tuned the bass, then tuned the last tenor drone.  As the sound swelled,
572 he walked the path, the shining dust turning into pavement.

576 Well, guysI'm back from an absence of about a week.  Ted Mittelstaedt
577 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: The dark flowed around him, with water's
578 gentle caress. No sound, no light, no taste, no touch met his senses. His
579 mind reached out in fear as it always did when he used his boots. Meeting a 
580 dead blankness, he lightly rebuked himself for his mind state. He spread his
581 arms and legs and focused his mind into the inside of itself. "Roll the 
582 Stones tape" he commanded. The startup sequenced grabbed his mind and 
583 twisted it. Lights flared and settled into the familiar pattern of the song.
584 Music began and he wove it into his journey. The lyrics began and he relaxed
585 into them. The music grew stronger, reaching its climax and as the full 
586 power behind them flowed into its familiar channels he thrust himself 
587 through the space. The patterns began to fade, replaced by the greenery of
588 the living forest. The music faded also and he arrived, staring up at the 
589 soft leaves waving in the breeze.
