25   I looked down at my feet dangling in the crystal clear water. How long had
26 I been sitting here on this rock? Calling, calling, until a small shadow of
27 doubt crossed my mind. No! I'm sure the spirit of the sea will return. She
28 could not forget me now, I need her council so very much. Who on the island
29 could I possibly talk to? Even Raza would hear no more of spirits, or voices
30 in the wind. I love Raza so much, and I know that he loves me, but ever
31 since that night I stood on this beach and saw the pattern in the stars
32 nothing in my life has been quite the same. If it hadn't happened to me I'd
33 never have believed that one short vision could completely alter my
34 existence. Maybe that's why it's so difficult to try to explain it to other
35 people.
36   "Magen, Magen is that you? Wait! I must talk to you. Don't move. I'll swim
37 over. Please wait!"
38   I looked across the bay and there was Raza running down the sandy beach.
39 He paused under a palm tree to remove his tie, shirt, shoes and trousers.
40 That settled it. Raza wearing a tie.  How in the name of a million spirits
41 could anyone believe it made any sense to tie a knot around your neck? I
42 tried it with a piece of muskadine vine and nearly choked to death. Such
43 foolishness of dress was relatively harmless compared to the wearing of
44 those shoes. I placed one bare foot on the sand and felt the natural
45 he flow of energy ran through my body all the way to my finger
46 tips. I raised my arms up to the sky and gave thanks for the gift.
47   "Good Lord Magen, have you turned into a complete pagan?"
48   "Why hello Raza, how wonderful to see you. My but you look beautiful in
49 that outfit. Why don't you wear it more often?", I smiled.
50   "This is no laughing matter Magen. I swear if you could see yourself, see
51 how you've changed. Living in the roots of a Banyan tree, foraging for your
52 arely enough clothes to cover your vital regions..."
53   "Well your 'vital regions' are seeing the light of day for the first time
54 in quite a while. By the way, have you considered the possibility that it
55 might be you who has changed? Once you and I lived the days together, ran
56 down the beach hand in hand, ate the food provided by the island and the
57 sea, but above all else we were happy."
58   "Some time we all have to grow up and face reality."
59   "Raza, Raza, feel the wind and sun on your body, feel the sand under your
60 feet, feel that essential connection that links us all."
61   "Enough, enough. Next it'll be, 'Drink only the water that falls from the
62 sky, pure as the heavens, and stay out of places connected with the hum.'"
63   "Yes Raza, that is essential."
64   "Just forget it. Why do I bother trying to talk sense into you Magen?
65 Sometimes it seems we no longer speak the same language. This living out
66 here alone has changed you."
67   "No one is really alone."
68   "See, there you go again. You may not be aware of it but I've got more
69 important things to do than stand around this beach naked, talking about
70 such foolishness."
71   Raza's last words were carried away by the wind as he turned abruptly,
72 dived into the bay, and began swimming toward the opposite shore. I tried to
73 return to my vigil, but my thoughts drifted back along the sequence of
74 events that had brought me full circle, back to this bay, back to again seek
75 the advice and wisdom of the spirit of the sea. I knew there was something
76 vital that I must understand. My inner voice said so, and what good is an
77 inner voice if you don't listen to what it says?

82 AAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGG!!!
83 I MADE A REALLY DUMB MISTAKE! I FINISHED READING DB AND PUT MY ENTRY ON IT 
84 BY MISTAKE!!!!! ARRRRG! Sorry about that folks... But the entry is on lines
85 numbered 590 through 610
86 hope I'm not missed too greatly. My silly mistake though.   (aarrrrrg?)

90         I managed to keep the questions regarding the man's parentage to
91 myself, but the sheer idiocy of his replies did indeed try my patience. He
92 made New Englanders appear like talkative socialites in comparison. But after
93 a little 'friendly' persuasion, I managed to get the information I wanted out
94 of him, and bounded 3 steps at-a-time up to the second floor. 
95         The powers-that-be at NET pride themselves in the ability to prepare
96 their field agents for any combat/non-combat situation. Ian himself has
97 spearheaded many of the innovations in NET training. But all of the training
98 in the world couldn't have prepared me for what I saw upon opening the
99 stairwell door. Two doors down on the left, floating about 6 inches off the
100 ground, wicked looking appendages pointing into the room, marked 23 on the
101 open door, was the meanest looking man-killer I had ever seen in my life. By
102 reflex only, I pulled my weapon up, and aimed. Simultaneously, a very
103 large cylinder rotated on the top of the device. I didn't wait to see what
104 kind of greeting I would get from this thing, so I fired my gun.
105         The ensuing explosion rocked the hallway, and I went tumbling to the 
106 deck. A shower of sparks lighted the hall with a brazen light, turning the   
107 rug and a nearby hotel-motel piece d'art into flames. I was up quickly, and
108 after stamping out the rug (I left the picture burn; you would have too),
109 stepped into the room. The pandemonium within just about equalled that which
110 took place out in the hall only moments before.
111         Six bodies lay on the floor, covered with varying amounts of debris
112 from the now-defunct device and what was left of the room. The dust settled
113 quickly, and with the light coming in from the glassless and curtainless
114 window, I set checking for damages to the six occupants.
115         The first body I checked was clad in green, and fortunately for him
116 he was already dead. A follower of Dangerfield, gone to meet his master. Next
117 came the form of agent Fellows, lying sprawled on a sofa. He was conscious,
118 and fairly coherent. I went on to a man still clutching a large service 45. I
119 didn't recognize him, but he seemed to be coming around, so I relieved
120 him of his gun, and an interesting looking watch, and went on checking. The
121 man near the window had no obvious wounds but was still unconscious. I 
122 checked for any concealed weapons, didn't find any, and continued my rounds.
123 Again I wasn't prepared for the next person I found on the ground. Petrov,
124 that sheep-lovin' sonovabitch. I raised my weapon, and was about ready to
125 send him to pervert heaven, when a groan arose from the one remaining
126 body I hadn't checked yet. I hadn't heard a groan like that since the time
127 Joshua and I had delighted in smoldering bamboo stalks shoved underneath
128 our fingernails that time back at the Dragon Room. Since Joshua and I...
129         "Joshua!", I shouted, forgetting for the moment my intent to
130 eradicate with extreme prejudice my old friend Petrov. "Are you all
131 right?" I could hardly believe my eyes. "Of course I am Parity! Stop
132 stammering like an old fool, and help me up!" I bent over to lend him a
133 hand, and kept on going, pushed from behind. "Petrov! I forgot all about
134 him." For someone supposedly unconscious from the blast, he moved
135 remarkably fast. I was able to get off on badly aimed shot, which took out
136 a part of the apartment room wall, but missed my mark. I was getting up to
137 give chase when Joshua grabbed my arm and insisted, "Let him go. I'll
138 explain later."
139         The celebration at finding Joshua was short-lived. Joshua quickly
140 gave me the scoop on what had happened here before I had announced myself,
141 while we tied up 'Farley' and the still-unidentified man, who was now awake
142 and complaining bitterly. A still shaky but ready-for-action Fellows was sent
143 to summon reinforcements and a clean-up crew from Portland NET HQ on the
144 comset. We would meet the reinforcements at a nearby safe-house. No doubt
145 all the noise and commotion would attract a large crowd.
146         We got out quickly, with our new prisoners in front of us. "My car
147 is too small for all of us.", Joshua said. "Don't worry, we'll walk. We won't
148 look out-of-place in this neighborhood.", I told him. I couldn't wait to
149 start the interrogation, and find out what in heck that contraption was. Speed
150 was of the essence, and the safe-house was only a few blocks away.
151         Joshua found at last. Petrov almost in my grasp. Fellows rescued. Two
152 new prisoners. And good results from the first field test of Ian's new
153 weapon. Not a bad afternoon, even by NET's high standards!

167 Cistop Mikey:  I know you did not do the original programming for BWMS, and
168    I know nothing, repeat, nothing about programming, but...isn't there a way
169    to set BWMS so that Changes/Deletions could be made only on the same call
170    the material was entered?  That would fix R.D.'s, but would still allow the
171    fancy borders and spelling corrections.  Also, will BWMS accept uploaded
172    files?  If so, how?  This would allow everyone to run their spelling checker
173    over their entry AND save time entering the story.  As you have noticed, it
174    does take a while to get on...
175 
176 Kathy:  YOU lighten up.  If you don't like comments, you can put them on disk
177    and read them yourself.  Noticing the frequency of your entries, you might
178    try being polite and letting SOMEONE ELSE on for a change.  Spending hours
179    waiting to get in doesn't make anyone happy...
180    PS--"them" refers to your writing.  I enjoy your writing, but no one is 
181    forcing you to write...

185 Fog: A 5.6?   Does that mean my writing is incredibly clear, or stupid, or both?
186 Net: I have a new theory concerning the level 4, I'll work on it.  If I am EXTREMELY lucky, I might have it by Sat.
187 By the way, is talking with other 'crackers legal?

191 *THIS* time I wasn't going to let him get away.  There wasn't anything that could go wrong, I thought...
192 The tinkle of glass hitting the floor after something had hit it suddenly convinced me otherwise.  Muttering an oath,
193 I hit the deck and turned over to shoot at the person at the window.
194 Reflexes, however, would have never saved me from the surprise istore for me.  The door fell apart into splinters as
195 that drone decided to crash the party.  Strange words were shouted at it from the window, and it turned its *VERY*
196 wicked-looking muzzle from me.  One of my prisoners, faster than I, summoned a gun as if by magic and proceeded to 
197 blast the hell out of the drone.
198 The ceiling fell about me after the drone exploded, pelting me with chunks of plaster and bits of wood.  Dust 
199 obscured my eyes for a moment, but my prisoner had just enough time to reverse our roles.
200 I cursed my bad luck again, under my breath.  I was tied up, and my 'com and gun taken.  I wondered how it would be
201 for me in the near-future, and if my new captors would be as slack as my last ones.  At least I had enough time to 
202 press the 'Help' button on the 'com.  Fred would wait, watch, and follow....

206 All: hardcopy of the two messages on DB (and possibly others) will be

209 will lower your test scores.

211 addition to the other requested info. (If you don't know what I'm

213         As for uploads, SOME "prompted upload" programs work, some don't
214 a "." seems to work with my software.
215 
216 Since the NET has a copy of the BWMS software (for rewrite purposes) I
217 can state the following:
218         At the present time there is *NO* way to make any changes to BW.
219         The system code is burned into an OBSOLETE type of EPROM. There
220         are also some gaps in the system docs that prevent certain areas
221         from being changed (we don't know what the CURRENT code for
222         those areas is).
223 L'homme: Ian "suggested" that you try the lower power configuartion next
224 time.

238 I thought that when school started up again, it would become easier to
239 get on here.  I seem to have been mistaken.  As it has been almost two
240 full days since last I visited the Inn, my prepared entry has been 
241 rendered extremely passe'.  Since my extemporaneous capabilites are 
242 \\\ do not meet my standards for public viewing, I'll have to try again
243 later.  (at which late time, it will again be outdated....).
244 To any who plan on putting Petrov into situations requiring him to 
245 extricate himself, don't.  He ain't here, he's in Corvallis, and so
246 unable to defend himself.  I save it all for him, though, so if you
247 have any praise for him (or immoral offers), go right ahead.  Just don't
248 expect an immediate response.

254 are what makes this system great.  I,
255 for one, do not mind the delays to get
256 on, because if people started to worry
257 about how long they spent here, the
258 quality of the stories would proably
259 suffer as a result.  If you hate the

363     After the swirling FOG cleared, (blown in through the open door, no
364 doubt) the practitioner pondered on the ramifications left in it's wake. It
365 was interesting that a phenomenon with a partial name of fog could actually
366 illuminate certain aspects of reality. In any case, it's appearance was a
367 welcome input even if some reactions were less than enthusiastic. Reactions
368 typically say more about the person doing the reacting than they do about
369 the initial event. Now that will probably elicit comments from those that
370 feel it's pointed in their direction, thought the keeper of the stone.
371     Some new yarns could be heard interwoven among the ever present flow of
372 comments indigenous to the Inn. Bravo! It is the telling of tall tales that
373 gives this place it's unique flavor. If any of you budding or blooming
374 authors need encouragement consider this as unbridled support. Try to let
375 critical comments guide you toward better writing, rather than toward angry
376 rebuttal. To paraphrase an old but true phrase: 'Those who can write---the
377 others become critics'. "I for one am enjoying the stories", he said aloud,
378 "FREE drinks for all the authors, on my tab. Perhaps a few quafs will serve
379 to remove a some inhibitions. Inside every new author is an excellent story
380 just waiting to get out."
381     Innkeeper you still operate the finest establishment around. I'll have
382 another of those ales myself, if you please.

385 Consider that the purpose of a system is to maintain itself.
386 Now consider that maintaining itself includes warding against
387 competitors for the same resources.  This generaly means trying
388 gain an advantage over a competitor. The most common way being
389 to strong arm them someway, usually by brute force. This allows
390 the system to gain more resources thus being able to grow larger
391 expand its teritory, and fight off even more competitors, until
392 there are none left, or at least none of concern.
393 Sounds like the normal growth of a corporation doesn't it?
394 Also sounds like the normal growth of an animal too.
395 Or even a species. The reason is simple, they are all systems,
396 and all follow the same general rules of life. 
397 And thus we come down to the definition of life. Life being 
398 a system which maintains and propagates itself. This is true
399 whether it be a human being, a dog, a bug, a tree, a corporation,
400 a religion, or even a computer. They are all maintaining and
401 trying to propagate themselves. I usally get a negative response
402 in regard to the computer, but consider the microcomputer industry,
403 Look at the growth of the IBM PC. It has followed the rules of
404 life systems amost to the letter. You may not agree that machines
405 can be representative of life, but they do follow the rules no
406 matter what you say. The other problem people have is accepting
407 that a belief structure can be considered to have life of its own,
408 yet it too follows those same rules for a life system.

433 Fred:Did you ever consider the
434 growth of the IBM PC you akin to a life system merely appears that way because
435 those that buy it are life systems themselves. To mention inanimate objects
436 such as computers in the same breath you mention life conjurs up images of
437 living machines and self-automated monsters. I tend to think more along the
438 lines that the only things that can be considered life systems are things
439 that can be placed under the heading of biological life. All other systems
440 are merely an interpretation and extension of the real biological life that
441 inhabits, uses, defines, shapes, and manipulates them. This reasoning
442 explains corporations, religions, forrests, computers, and anything else
443 you can think of. Your comments are well taken though, and I encourage you
444 and others to enter more along these lines. With the NET dialogue so heavy
445 on the airwaves, a nice subject for discussion and debate would be quite
446 welcome. Fred, you do have some very interesting ideas. Write more!

491 "My goodness a debate you say? Now there's a epicurean delight a person can
492 sink their metaphysical teeth into." Fred and A. Debater turned to get a
493 better look at the character seated nearby who had spoken. He continue, "I
494 couldn't help but overhear your conversation, hope you don't mind if I add
495 a note or two...
496 
497 Fred, your hypothesis of the purpose of a system being to maintain itself
498 can certainly be true within a limited context. Before addressing the issue
499 concerning whether one purpose, no matter how profound, could hardly be
500 considered necessary and sufficient conditions for defining life, there is
501 the small matter of who is making the definition of purpose. This seemingly
502 detached *system*; that is both perceiver of the apparent system, separate
503 from itself, and conveyer of purpose upon this separate system, holds the
504 essential key to the postulated mystery. Would not such a *system*, with
505 these magnanimous powers, perhaps have the tendency to project upon this
506 external system self characteristics. Would not this act of projection tend
507 to produce an identity between the two system, or a connection if you prefer.
508 Such a *system* could hardly be content with such a limited definition of
509 life. In other words life can be defined to include anything one wishes or
510 it can be restricted to include only the perceiving *system* itself, or
511 somewhere in between. In all cases the essential element is the nature of
512 the system that is determining the definition.
513 
514 One small, final point, if I may. Consider the fact that a system struggling
515 for mere survival has little time for such esoteric subjugations. Only a
516 being of greater purpose, with leisure time, can engage in such luxuries."

549    Okay, I've been pondering over names as of late- names of trees, names of
550 people, names of drinks, names of countries, names,names,names,names!  Just
551 the thought of an identity for something is driving me crazy. I'm a thinker,
552 I am.  Pretty heavy stuff to think and ponder over lately.  For instance: I've
553 been thinking about time: the word, the context, the meaning, the usage in 
554 all kinds of texts- and the actual concept of it.  What happens if everyone
555 in the world suddenly stops doing what they are doing and just stands still for
556 several seconds?  Would "time" as we know it become confused, and stop to com=
557 pensate for the lapse, or would it go ticking merrily away, minding its own 
558 business, letting the silly people do what they want??  Or what if all the
559 countries agree to ban the word "time" and replace it with...oh, lets see.
560 Howabout "eggplant"?  Central Standard Eggplant?  Mountain Eggplant?  Eggplant
561 after eggplant?  I somehow don't think that would be as feasible as it sounded
562 one minute ago...
563    And NAMES: What is in a name? "A rose smells just as sweet by any other name"
564 What is the concept of labeling something for identification?  Wouldn't it just
565 be as easy (maybe not for this generation) to learn something akin to UPC codes
566 for everything. 0001001011 might be your kid's best friend's dog's name.  Who
567 knows what the future holds in store?  And here's a good question that has been
568 bugging me for awhile- if the Dutch and the Belgians live in the same general
569 area of the world, the Dutch in Holland, and the Belgians in Belgium, why can't
570 we call the Belgians "Belch"?  I mean, it seems to be a trend, in a way. There
571 are the Welsh, and the aforementioned Dutch, so why should we leave out the
572 Belgians and call them that?  
573    Ah, well.  Enough foaming at the mouth to keep any healthy Yak busy...
574      --  It's around 9:00, eggplant for me to stampede on...
