49      I  had fought the clinging dark jungle for what seemed  like 
50 forever.   Always that goal in sight, the hill atop which stood a 
51 most magnifacent mansion as any eye had beheld.
52      Oh,  how  I  longed to be there,  to lay upon  the  grounds, 
53 embraced by the sweet aromas I knew would be there.   To drink of 
54 the  cool  dark  loving  waters  of that  deep  well  I  knew  so 
55 intimately.
56      On  I  fought,  for I knew that I only need struggle my  way 
57 through this harsh jungle ever clinging,  always trying to  force 
58 me  back  to the darkness of the hell I had struggled so long  to 
59 escape.
60      An  imposing  wall of thick veins and underbrush now  did  I 
61 face, and with a resolve of will I began to make my slow progress 
62 through.   Finally,  I  had  broken through this  nature  created 
63 boundry,  only to find a stought wall of rock seemingly  recently 
64 built  by the still damp mortar.   Built as if my coming had been 
65 known, and was a despirate attempt to keep me out.  
66      I  beat upon the wall with my tools,  and then with my  bare 
67 fists.   But  it  had  been  solidly built,  as  if  to  keep  me 
68 personally  out.   I  beat  upon  it until my hands  were  but  a 
69 bloodied mess.   My screams turned into sobing,  until  exausted, 
70 unable  to go on,  I fell sobing at the foot of the wall  admidst 
71 the  tatered  remains of the jungle rotting already  in  the  hot 
72 humid air, and remains of the mortar yet still damp.  
73      I  barely even noticed the shards of broken glass that drove 
74 their  sharp piercing pain into my side.   Moving only enough  to 
75 ease the painful tearing.   The world seemed to be filled with my 
76 cry of despair, and the rivers flowed with my tears.  
77      Would I be finally stopped so simply of my life long search, 
78 by  an obvious statement of no admitance?   I screemed my pain at 
79 the Gods,  I begged of my sorrow to the earth and sky.  But there 
80 was no one to listen,  all ears were stopped shut.  And the Gods, 
81 but  laughed  their amusement of one so foolish to think  that  I 
82 could achieve the safty and comfort of this beautiful home.  
83      I  knew  it was there behind the wall,  it always  has  been 
84 there  for me to see.   But,  now I'm locked out with this  fresh 
85 built wall.  My goal so close that I can even now smell the sweet 
86 fragrance drifting through the air.   I plead to the Gods,  but I 
87 sobs are only returned as laughter.   Am I to forever be stranded 
88 in this hidious jungle?   So close yet so far from my goal,  this 
89 garden of eden amidst the clingling death filled jungle?  
90      The world is filled with my cry of despair,  the rivers flow 
91 with my tears.

	"With the eyes of a fool," he said,
114 	"You see the state you're in,
115 	And still you stumble through your stupid life,
116 	Still you laugh and grin;
117 	Vagabond on a winding road
118 	That only leads you down,
119 	Blind to the dangers and dismay
120 	That wipe the innocent smile away
121 	From the face of a laughing clown."
122 
	Imbecile, you are acting like a fool again,
123 	In a world of thieves all ready to run you down,
124 	Imbecile, they are waiting till you make the first mistake,
125 	And you're going to make it,
126 	That's why I'll always call you an Imbecile.
127 
	"You weren't always a sorcerer,"
128 	The joker then replied,
129 	"It seems to me you learned it on the way,
130 	You live by tricks and lies;
131 	Standing round in your juggler's gown,
132 	There seems no reason why;
133 	Flashing your eyes and casting spells
134 	With candles and signs and magic bells,
135 	Oh, you are the fool, not I."
136 	
Imbecile, you can call me that if you feel the need,
137 	But life is short and I am living it while I can.
138 	If it rains, I'll get wet but in the sunshine I'll be dry,
139 	It is you who are foolish,
140 	Just 'cause I laugh, don't call me an Imbecile.
141 
	"We both are right" said the sorcerer,
142 	"And both of us are wrong,
143 	For though we walk this road we don't know where it leads,
144 	We only know it's long.
145 	You have something to learn from me,
146 	And I can learn from you;
147 	You with your jokes and simple plans
148 	And me with my tricks and sleight of hand,
149 	Together we could get through."
150 
	Imbecile, we are dancing down a darkened road,
151 	Though the stars are out, not one of us knows the way.
152 	Imbeciles up ahead of us and millions more behind,
153 	And we're laughing and smiling,
154 	That's why I say we're all of us Imbeciles.

276 Leonard:  a LITTLE something?
277  
278      All right!  Who accidentally dumped MacHinery's negative response file?
279                                P. Trov

282     Carmichael did a passable immitation of gaping in amazement.
283     'What did he do; park on the wrong side of a dry wash?' He asked, tryg
284 to lighten the mood, (or did the highway patrol catch him with a joint) he
285 was thinking to himself.  Most of these little burgs were ok if you watch
286 yourself but occasionaly there were quaint local customs one had to be ca-
287 ful not to offend.
288      'We were hoping to avoid this', his 'host' spoke ominously, 'but I'll
289 have to ask you to come with me.  Walk on aheadand do exactly as I tell you
290 and I might avoid seriosly injuring you.'
291      'Always chereful to oblidge', was Carmichael's flipant reply, instany
292 rewarded by a half expected kick, poorly aimed.  As he reached to take -
293 vantage of his 'host's' careless balance, he discouvered that his guide
294 this desert wonder-land had multiplied.  This point was brought home by hd
295 wood billy accross his temple.  Not hard enough to save his feet the troue
296 of providing transport, just enough to assure him that he would not get lly
297 any time soon.
298      Outside the first door he was guided away from the way he had come.
299   Carefully he negotiated the rough hewen narrow steps leading downward io
300 the unknown.  His worries as to a possibly assisted too rapid decent were
301 cut short by a briliant flash which turned him into a blind man.
302      Had he been climbing the stairs, his sightlessness would have been p-
303 menant.  As dim and hazy vission of sorts returned slowly, accompanied by
304 the grand daddy of all excedran headaches, it became descustingly obvio
305 that the object which had fallen against his ankles, had reciently been the
306 lower torso of Bill E. Club!  Of 'mister Master of Cerimonies' there was 
307 no sign.  Neither for that mater was there the least evidance that the abe
308 ground portions of the structure to which he had so receintly been confined
309 had been more than a figment of his warped immagination.
310      The time table, on which he would soon be falling behind was no prodt
311 of personal delusions however.  How he was to cross the remaining 50 miles
312 of open desert in the next two hours remained to be seen!
313 0909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090909

315 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (is one really there?)
316      Caught between the words in his tale to the boy, there was the glint
317 of a reflection in the eye of his mind.  For the moment he had thought that
318 the one that stood by his side was that which had been met in another land,
319 in another time.  Words flooded thorugh him, losing the ones he had struggled
320 to prepare for deliverance.  Washed clean, they would not surface now.
321 The words had risen, but now had fallen... gone from recall.  Damn.
322      Looking to his side, the Guardian now only saw the one that was Francis,
323 the boys elder brother.  He now sees a boy when a moment ago he had seen...
324 had he seen her?  The mind is a terrible vastness that conspires to create
325 what we want most to see when we are scared, when we are confused.  Alone?
326      The confusion was being lost now, the words to the tale would return,
327 but the feeling was getting harder to hide.  The Guardian squeezed his eyes
328 shut to supress the tears that would now flow from that illusions absence.
329 The presence of the illusion in the mind was almost enough, but far too much.
330      "Where was I this time?  Oh...  Yes.  It was Edric..."  The tale 
331 would be told for that was all there was, the telling of the tale.
332 Isn't it so?  Isn't that what we are all here for?  The telling of our lies
333 and creations?  No, don't answer, I am not here either.  None of me are.

403 As a long-time lurker, away for a few weeks, I have an observation:
404 BW seems to have been taken over by the kiddies.  Not necessarily, of course,
405 the "juvies" of old, just kiddies.  Is this really as it appears?  Is there
406 anyone out there over the age of 17?  What happened to the adults?

417     So there is a difference between Juvies and people seventeen and younger.
418     Not being one to argue, I agree, but as far as Backwater having been taken
419 over by the Juvies ( Oops, under seventeens )  I think not.
420     The writers are mostly in their twenties, and those that aren't, are going
421 headlong into it.

427 credit Fortran course for high school students at Gonzaga University. We got
428 to punch our own card decks & wait for the IBM 360 to crank out the results..

430 As for the list.. 
431 1. That kind of thing used to be the main content of BW disks (check the 
432 archives!)

437 A ship sailed at dawn,
438 Grestigast bay,
439 it's name was "The Fawn",
440 it shone and it's hull was hit by the spray,
441 Of the ocean's waves,
442 the turning, churning mass,
443 a hand that saves,
444 or kills with it'S grasp,
445 It flew out of the dock port,
446 in splendor and grandure,
447 it's captain was a man,
448 with a noble stature,
449 But even he,
450 could not hope to defend,
451 ainst the mighty sea serpent,
452 that would bring about their end,
453 and so the ship worried,
454 as it cxurned over the sea,
455 It's sails open to the wind,
456 txe breeze flowing free,
457 until that huge monster,
458 In a plume of the brine,
459 turned up and attacked,
460 for the men of the ship, txis would be their last time,
461 to see the sun,
462 to see the stars,
463 things they took advantage of,
464 whe~ veiwed froma afar,
465 on a distant shore,
466 some miles away,
467 from the sea and the chores,
468 toil of every day,
469 crubbing the decks and fixing the sails,
470 these men were brave,
471 but all harts fail,
472 to the might of the sea Dragon,
473 not closing with speed,
474 "Ram the Dragon" shouted the captain,
475 "An attack I shall lead,
476 against this foul creature,
477 of the dark sea,
478 we'll see who will win,
479 who's soul will be free,
480 It shall be my men and me!"
481 And with that he turned the wheel,
482 of the boat,
483 And it headed for the surreal,
484 form of the dragon as it attacked.
485 He prayed to his lord,
486 that they might yet live,
487 or stop txis foul demon,
488 he asked for diliverance to give,
489 to them all.
490 The dragon was gaining speed,
491 the dragon's mouth opened wide,
492 nough space to swallow the boat inside,
493 With a final triumphAnt blow,
494 the boat struch the dragon,
495 The creature's anger did grow,
496 It thrashd about and did it's best,
497 to remove the boat lest,
498 it have it stuc{k there for the rest,
499 it's days..
500  boat is still there,
501 the Dragon is not,
502 it's souk was sent,
503 to someplace rather hot (hehehe),
504 It's gone for good,
505 no need to fear,
506 it's ugly maw,
507 for you did hear,
508 of how the noble captain grand,
509 saved his ship,
510 ossibly his land....
511 *@*@* The Seafaring Minstrel *@*@*@*@*@
512 All: PLEASE!!!! COMMENT ON MY WORKS!!!
513  The minstrel looked on at the people of Backwater and asked 
514 "I have told some stories that I know. But are there any subjects that 
515 you would like me to sing about? Anything
516 at all?
517 *@*@*@*@*@*@ The questioning minstrel *@*@
518 `,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,
519  Does being 17 and a half cut it?  Maybe, maybe not... it all depends on what
520 I just finish reading.  Sometimes you just have to be a little strange, it's
521 okay if it doesn't hurt anyone else.  It lets some of the pressure of ordinary
522 life escape.  You might as well have some fun doing it.
523 
524 - Minstrel -  Have faith in yourself!  You don't have to look to the outside
525 to find satisfaction, look to yourself.  See how you like your songs.  If you
526 read anything that is negitive, just remember that you can't please everyone, 
527 not all at the same time.  It's appreciate the saying 'you have to appreciate
528 yourself before others will appreciate you.'
529 `,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`,`Mark`,`,`,`,
530 Ah, 17.  If I only had the intervening 15 years between then & now to do
531 over again....   sigh.

534 Minstrel:  I agree with Mark--If you derive personal satisfaction from your
535 poetry then you shouldn't worry about what others think.  This is rarely the
536 case, though.  I'm sure your purpose involves entertaining readers, and when 
537 possible, causing them to stop and contemplate.
538       The most important thing you have to work on, in my opinion, is rhythm.
539 I find the stories you have to offer interesting, but I get  tangled up in the
540 widely varying line length.  This problem even tends to impair your rhyme
541 scheme as the reader's mind creates an end-of-sentence where one was not 
542 intended. (sorry for the vague explanation)
543      The rhythm of which I speak (or meter, as I believe it's called) is the
544 most time consuming factor I face when writing poetry--It is, however, the key
545 to fluency.
546      Keep up the work, Minstrel.  I believe you have a talent or insight or 
547 gift or something which has prompted me to leave this message -- something I
548  ery rare y do.ng which has prompted me to leave this message -- something I
549 very rarely do.

552 ... but then again, poetry doesn't have to have a set, concrete rhythm.  As
553 many write it, poetry can have shape to it (ie words describing a tree,
554 collected into the form of a tree rather than stanza or paragraph), or it
555 could be fully freeform, or as above, using the metered forms and rhyming
556 patterns such as ABAB, AABBA, ABCB, ABBA, ...    I tend to regard poetry as
557 any collection of words that are not strict prose; even then, some prose is
558 very poetically written.
