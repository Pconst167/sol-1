44 Wazzamatta, Mike, did we say something so offensive you had to get rid 
45 of it? Change a disk at only 522 lines??
46 
47 Well, then, on to newer and better things. Have you seen anything on the
48 "new" theory about 'nuclear winter'? Seems that current claculations imply
49 that even a small nuclear war could put enough dust into the air to cause
50 a large ice age. Or, in other words, the bomb is truly the ultimate weapon.
51 It would be the war to end all wars, because no one could survive it.
52 It (the dust) would filter out the sunlight before it reached the ground
53 and the plants could use it to make food for themselves <or us>, and the
54 temperature would drop  several dozen degrees. As the upper air would
55 be warmer, convection would not stir it up, and so the effect lasts longer.
56 The effect is exaclty what is described in the gological record at the
57 end of the Silurian, when the dinosaurs died out.
58    What this means to us is that nuclear war is not a useable option, 
59 except in the case of new Masada. (A group of Jews held out on a hill called
60 Masada against a much larger Roman force, until when they could not possibly
61 win they all commited suicide.)
62    We cannot unilaterally abandon strong weapons; there are to many who
63 would take advantage, but if we can't use what we have to our advantage
64 what good is it, except in suicide? We need a suitable defense against
65 aggressors (not just the Russians), but not the doomsday machine. I would
66 suggest emphasizing the 'C' and 'B' in the CBR arsenal {chemical biological
67 radiological} It sure isn't nice to gas somebody, but is blowing them away
68 or leaving them to glow in the dark better? The effects aren't nice but they
69 are a lot less final for the bystanders, if they ar far enough away.
70 Of course I would rather shoot somebody, or burn them with napalm, it's
71 much more macho, but suicide isn't my game. Remember, we only have one (1)
72 Earth.
73    To go along with this, was the desicion to abandon all defensive anti-
74 missile weapons based on a misguided 'reduction of tensions' or a real
75 recognition that they don't work? There is no way an MX is less tension
76 causing than an anti-missile. How about killer satelites? Death rays?
77 Or maybe we should blow them away before they get achance at us. It's been
78 a long time since a major war, we should be about due for a new one. 
79 Will it be the last one?

83 Ay...it was I, who can be called by the name `Luke', who approached the
84 Inn before, and in my first time ignorance, left a scathing letter to
85 the soap boxers I found inside, preaching about such drivel as evolution.
86 Whoops...there I go again. In my young years(I am merely still an
87 apprentice, although nearly done) that I leave such impetuous messages
88 to otherwise well meaning inn-goers. My apologies to all. Think of my
89 first visit as a mis guided and unsuspecting visit. Believe me, the first
90 time at the inn can be rather hectic, and my inexperience at such
91 happenings showed in my outburst. But let us forget the past, for in
92 my deliberations of my earlier actions, I have discovered that the Inn
93 is really a fascinating place to be. Forgive me Inn keeper and patrons,
94 and I hope you welcome me into your conversations, although controversial,
95 none the less enjoyable. I will try to make daily visits to the Inn...
96 To share in a friendly argument, and more importantly, to share in
97 intellect, which from my few visitations seems to be in great abundance.
98 I always wondered where the thinkers of our society went in their off
99 hours, and now I now where at least a few of them go. It is a diverse
100 yet facsinating bunch that meets here, and I hope you will let me join
101 in the festivities. Again, if my earlier comments trouble any of you,
102 I again apologize, and if it takes awhile for you to accept me into
103 your group, the I accept that. Remember that as an aprentice, I am here
104 to learn, and mistakes made are one way learn, and I have made a few,
105 and will no doubt make some more. Well my time in front of you grows longer
106 so I will relinquish my place here for the next lucky patron. I will
107 return eagerly tomorrow in hopes of hearing your replies, and whether
108 you accept me, even on a trial basis, into the cast of the Inn.
109 And in one closing note on the message above. Good show, for I believe
110 it is more inportant to act and think about our future, than to worry
111 about our past.
112 Thanks you good patrons...

114 Good Idea BAD!
115 Consider the relative merits of the following ways to kill/be killed: 
116 1.  Nerve gas.  2. Anthrax bomb.  3. Bullet.  4. CBU-72.  5.  Napalm.  6. Atomic bomb.  7. Death ray.
117 
118 If I had to choose a weapon to kill the enemy, my list of preferences would be 6,4,7,5,3,1,2.  I'm just an extrovert at
119 heart, and I love big explosions.  Nerve gas and anthrax are just too silent for my tastes.  If I had to choose a list of
120 preferences as a way to die, it would be 7,4,1,2,6,3,5.  I don't like fire, as you can tell, but 4. doesn't really qualify as
121 fire anyway.
122 Let's hear from you lurkers out there. Yes, you!  I saw you hide behind your keyboard!  What's YOUR favorite weapon?

137    IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE , SEEING THAT I DO NOT IN THE LEAST ENJOY ANY
138 PAIN OR ANXIETY IN ANY FORM (AS I AM SURE MANY DO NOT), I WOULD TEND TO SAY
139 THAT BEING STRUCK (UNSUSPECTING ANY FORM OF ATTACK) BY A HIGH POWER NUCLEAR
140 WARHEAD AT A RANGE OF IMMEDIATE VAPORIZATION WOULD BE THE WAY IN WHICH I
141 WOULD MOST LIKE TO GO (AMONGST OTHER POSSIBILITIES).  THE ACTUAL PROCESS
142 OF BEING DESTROYED IN THIS WAY WOULD ONLY LAST FOR A FEW MILLISECONDS AND
143 THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO DEAL WITH (EVEN FOR AN INSTANT).  I DON'T KNOW,
144 MAYBE I AM BEING A LITTLE SADISTIC... WHAT DO YOU THINK?

149      ACTUALLY, I REALLY DON'T SEE THAT A DISCUSSION OF HOW ONE PREFERS
150 TO DIE IS VERY HELPFUL OR POSITIVE.  IS THIS WHAT WAS MENTIONED AS A
151 "POSITIVE" TOPIC?  OH WELL, I SUPPOSE IF IT CAME DOWN TO IT, I'D RATHER
152 GO LIKE SLIM PICKINS DID IN "DR. STRANGELOVE", RIDING A BOMB ALL THE WAY.
153 IT COMES DOWN TO GOING QUICKLY I SUPPOSE, AS I'M NOT A MASOCHIST.
154 HOW ABOUT A PREMATURE BURIAL FOR ALL YOU POE LOVERS?  PERHAPS SUDDEN 
155 DECOMPRESSION IN SPACE?  WHAT ABOUT HAVING YOUR SKIN SLOWLY REMOVED BY
156 A CHEESE GRATER?  AH, THESE FUN SUBJECTS.  AS TO THE IDEA THAT THE 
157 "NUCLEAR WINTER" WOULD HELP OUR LEADERS BEGIN DISARMING, I THINK THAT 
158 THEY BELIEVE THEY WILL SURVIVE NO MATTER WHAT DUE TO THEIR "PREPARATIONS".
159 DEATH FROM NUCLEAR WAR IS FOR THE SERFS (MEANING US), NOT THE RULING
160 CLASS.  I DON'T THINK THE LEADERS OF ANY OF THE NATIONS INVOLVED HAVE ANY
161 INTENTION OF DISARMING.  I WILL BELIEVE THEY DO WHEN WE SEE AN AGREEMENT
162 THAT ACTUALLY CALLS FOR A *REDUCTION* IN EXISTING WEAPONS, NOT BEFORE.
163 
164      WELCOME, LUKE!  PULL UP A CHAIR, GRAB A TANKARD, AND ENJOY!!  I
165 LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE FROM YOU.

167      JODY, ENJOY YOUR WIZARD.  BUT MAKE SURE YOU FIND OUT HIS INTENTIONS.

213 IT OVERFLOWED. (AND FROM THE LOOKS ABOVE I WAS RIGHT.) 
214 DJJ: YES, THE OFF IN BOTH CASES DOES THE SAME THING. THE AMOUNT OF TIME
215 IT TAKES TO PERFORM THE OFF IS DEPENDANT UPON WHERE THE CURRENT FILE
216 POINTER IS. IF IT IS AT THE END OF THE DISK (LINE 629) THEN IT HAS TO
217 GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE TOP OF THE FILE (LINE 0) TO CLOSE IT. AT
218 40 MILLISECONDS PER LINE STEP RATE, THIS TAKES A BIT OF TIME. IF THE
219 POINTER IS ALREADY AT THE TOP (DUE TO A PREVIOUS COMMAND TAKING IT 
220 THERE SUCH AS TOP, OR LN 1) THEN OF COURSE IT DOESN'T NEED TO GO 
221 ANYPLACE SO IT GETS DONE MUCH FASTER.
222 OTHERS: RE DIEING; MY YOU ARE A MORBID BUNCH OUT THERE. MYSELF, I PREFER
223 TO GO QUICKLY. AS TO THERE VARIOUS WEAPONS AVAILABLE, I FIND BIOLOGICAL
224 WARFARE TO BE THE MOST STUPID. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PREVENT THE SICKNESS
225 YOU CREATE FROM HITTING YOUR OWN TROOPS?! CHEMICAL WARFARE IS LARGLY 
226 JUST INHUMANE, BUT THEN MOST WARFARE IS. THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH NUCULAR
227 WARFARE IS NOW THAT YOU'VE BLOWN THEM TO DUST WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
228 THE LAND IS WORTHLESS FOR ANYTHING. ALL THAT YOU'VE MANAGED TO DO IS
229 TO BLOWUP A FEW BILLION PEOPLE. OF COURSE IF THAT WAS YOUR ONLY 
230 OBJECTIVE..... OF COURSE, AGAIN AS WITH CHEMICAL WARFARE, I DON'T FIND
231 IT ALL THAT EXCITING. I GUESS IN THE END IF THERE HAD TO BE WAR I WOULD
232 PREFER THAT IT BE FOUGHT WITH GUNS AND SUCH. AT LEAST THERE WHEN 
233 SOMEONE KILLS SOMEONE ELSE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND HOPEFULLY
234 THIS WILL AT LEAST MAKE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING. IT IS
235 FAR TO EASY TO PUSH A BUTTON THAT KILLS A BILLION PEOPLE AND BE ABLE
236 TO SAY THAT IT REALLY WASN'T ME, AS IT IS TO ISOLATED ( YOU DON'T SEE
237 IMEDIATELY THE EFFECTS OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE). LASERS, DEATH RAYS FIT
238 ALONG THE LINES OF GUNS. ACTUALLY, MOST PEOPLE WOULD JUST AS SOON NOT
239 WAR. IT IS THE LEADERS AND OTHER MALCONTENTS THAT FORCE WARS. AND 
240 BRAINWASH THE PEOPLE INTO BELIEVING THAT IT IS 'RIGHT'. I'M SORRY,
241 BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT KILLING SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING 
242 TO ME TO GAIN THAT KIND OF RESPONSE IS RIGHT. I REALLY THINK THAT
243 IF YOUR GOING TO KILL SOMEONE IT SHOULD BE THE LEADERS, AFTER ALL
244 IT IS THEY WHO CAUSED THE PROBLEMS IN THE FIRST PLACE. OF COURSE
245 MAYBE THE SHEEP WHO FOLLOW THE LEADERS TO THE SLAUGHTER DESERVE WHAT
246 THEY GET. WE ARE SORELY IN NEED OF AN IMPROVED SOCIAL AWARENESS IN
247 THE WORLD, FOR WITHOUT THE CANNON FODDER TO FIGHT THE WARS FOR THEM
248 THERE WOULD BE NO WARS FOR THE LEADERS TO FIGHT OTHER THEN AMONGST
249 THEMSELVES. AND AS LONG AS WE KEEP WEAPONS AWAY FROM THEM THAT MIGHT
250 HURT US, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THEY CAN KILL THEMSELVES OFF ALL 
251 THEY WANT!

305 In response to Erik's idea re a game to decide the outcome of a war, I
306 heartily agree.  It seems that there was a book written about just such
307 an incident.  Who do we write to to get this idea off the ground?

311 
312    Lurker, you might try writing to God, as you'll never convince our 
313 leaders to fight the war. They would rather YOU did, since they don't want
314 their own skins harmed. And there have been quite a few books, short 
315 stories, plays, and TV shows written around the concept. In the Science   
316 Fiction area, it ranks just a little behind the "and the last 2 survivors 
317 names were Adam and Eve.. The End?" type tripe as far as the number of
318 variations on the theme.
319    Pam, I am still here, but I rarely comment anymore. I wouldn't have

336 Ugh, did I really ask how should we die? I was really trying to discuss
337 weapons to use on then, not their choice on us. As to games rather than 
338 war, games imply rules, and there are no rule to war, except beat the !@#$%
339 off the enemy, until they admit defeat. The ruling class in any war will
340 try hard not to attack the rulers of another unless absolutely necessary:
341 don't start something you don't want returned, and if the war can be kept
342 to serfs...

346 PAM: LET'S SEE, AS I REMEMBER YOUR QUESTIONS....
347 FIRST, THE UNSAFE MESSAGE. THIS MESSAGE WILL OCCUR IF THE PREVIOUS USER
348 DID NOT TYPE OFF BEFORE HANGING UP. AND SIMPLY MEANS THAT THERE IS A 
349 POSSIBILITY THAT ALL OR PART OF THE MESSAGE THAT WAS ENTERED MAY HAVE
350 BEEN LOST. (SOME HELP HUH?) IT IS A LEFT OVER MESSAGE FROM WHEN THE
351 SYSTEM WAS USED AS A DATA ENTERY DEVICE. SUGGESTING TO THE OPERATOR TO
352 CHECK TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY LOST DATA. OF COURSE IN A MULTI USER 
353 ENVIORNMENT LIKE THIS IT DOESN'T DO MUCH GOOD SINCE THE NEXT CALLER IS
354 NOT LIKELY TO BE THE SAME PERSON. AH WELL...
355 LET'S SEE... ALL ALLOWED: AH YES, ANOTHER HOLD OVER FROM DAYS GONE BY.
356 I CAN CHANGE THE OPERATIONAL CONDITION OF THE DISK FROM READ/WRITE 
357 WHICH IS THE NORMAL ALL ALLOWED CONDITION TO BE ENTER ONLY (WHICH I HAVE
358 SET DRIVE B TO RIGHT NOW SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE NEW MESSAGE IT CAUSES.)
359 OR WRITE PROTECTED WHICH PREVENTS ANYTHING FROM BEING WITTEN TO DISK. IN 
360 ENTER ONLY YOU CAN ENTER A MESSAGE, BUT YOU CANNOT CORRECT IT ONCE IT IS
361 ENTERED. THIS CAN BE USED TO PREVENT MALCONTENTS FROM ERASING OR CHANGING
362 OTHER USERS MESSAGES. AND HAS BEEN USED IN THE PAST FOR JUST THIS VERY
363 REASON.
364 ER.. LETS SEE, WHAT'S NEXT.. OH YES.. MARGIN:
365 WELL, THE INVALID PARAMETER IS MY OWN BUG THAT I CAUSED. WHEN I WAS TRYING
366 TO MODIFY BWMS FOR THIS SYSTEM I TRYED TO MODIFY THE MARGIN COMMAND.
367 EXACTLY WHAT I WAS ATTEMPTING TO DO I DON'T REMEMBER, BUT IT ENDED UP
368 THAT THE INVALID PARAMETER MESSAGE WOULD OCCUR WHEN YOU SET THE MARGIN
369 TO 128. AS FOR THE BUG WITH THE FIND COMMANDS, THAT WAS ALWAYS THERE,
370 IN FACT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT IT WAS THERE UNTIL IT SHOWED UP HERE.
371 (THATS A BUG THAT STAYED HIDDEN FOR 4 YEARS!) IT NEVER SHOWED UP IN 
372 THE DATA ENTERY APPLICATION BECAUSE NOBODY USED 128 CHARACTERS PER LINE.
373 SOMEONE ELSE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE IN SPEED
374 BETWEEN SAYING 'DB' AND 'OFF' IN WHEN THE 'OFF' ACTUALY OCCURS. I RESPONDED
375 WITH SOME MUMBOJUMBO ABOUT HOW IT WAS NOT REALLY DIFFERENT. I APPOLIGIZE.
376 YOU WERE RIGHT, IT IS FASTER WITH 'DB'. AS NEAR AS I CAN FIGURE OUT, WHAT
377 IS HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN YOU TYPE 'OFF' IT ACTUALLY BACKS UP ONE LINE
378 AT A TIME (THE 'UP' COMMAND DOES THIS TOO, WHICH IS WHY IT CAN TAKE MUCH
379 LONGER THEN THE 'LN' COMMAND. SAME WITH 'DO'.) APPARENTLY THE 'DB' COMMAND
380 USES DIFFERENT CODE TO GET TO THE TOP WHICH JUST GOES THERE INSTEAD OF
381 BACKING UP THUS ALLOWING IT TO GET THERE FASTER. THIS IS ONLY A GUESS,
382 AS I DIDN'T WRITE THE CODE, SO I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE.
383 WANT TO SEE SOMETHING REALLY WIERD?... TYPE 'PR -' IT'S SELF EXPLAINITORY.
384 PAM: YES I DID SEE THE LASTEST MONTY PYTHON FLICK A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
385 I THINK I LIKED THE OPENING SHORT THE BEST, BUT THE WHOLE THING WAS 
386 BIZZARE AND STRANGE, SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY FOR SURE. AS MONTY II SAID
387 'EVERY SPERM IS SACRED!'.
388 AND NOW... SINCE I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE CPM USERS GROUP MEETING AND I
389 AM VERY TIRED, I THINK I WILL GO TO SLEEP..ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

392 In regards to weapon preference, and I don't mean to be a copycat, but
393 I agree with Eric. The mind is the best weapon I can think of. What a way
394 to fool an oponent, by out-thinking him(please excuse the use of him,
395 but I have an aversion to using he/she, and I dearly hope him is taken
396 in the strictist of general terms(?). Anyway...The mind for use as a weapon
397 is a waste too though. Such a powerful thing(regardless if we use 10% or 
398 whatever of its capacity) should not be wasted on destruction or betterment
399 at the expense of others. It should be used to further ourselves, and that
400 doesn't always mean progress either. We should use our minds to better our
401 condition, not lower the condition of others. But I see myself climbing
402 up again on one of the Inn's sturdy table. Someone please give me a push
403 so I don't stay up here blabbering too long. Two closing notes...
404 1)All of the destructive weapons came from the same minds we wish to
405 improve ourselves with...
406 and 2) Given a choice of a way to die...I choose old age!!!

411 Some time back i noticed someone mentioned the major drawback to nuclear
412 weapons was after you had used them there was nothing left to occupy.  
413 (Was that your rant Mikey?)  That effect was one of the reasons behind 
414 the development of the lovely weapon known as the neutron bomb.  This is
415 one of the more "useful" atomic weapons.  It's mode of killing is non-
416 destructive to property.  The neutron bomb is a thermonuclear weapon so
417 constructed that the bulk of its energy is released not as heat, not as
418 radiation, not as mechanical shock but as a flood of neutrons.  (neutrons
419 could be called radiation, I suppose but normal terminology does not include
420 them.  It includes protons (alpha), electrons (beta), and electromagnetic
421 (gamma) radiation)  By detonating this weapon high above a city or opposing
422 army you can kill all human life in a fairly large area.  The kill radius
423 varies with the yield of the weapon, the height of the detonation, and the
424 material intervening between the victims and the weapon.  It is not too
425 hard to believe some of the figures I have heard (sorry, I must decline
426 to quote sources on this)
427 -- If a medium yield neutron flux weapon were to be detonated over the city
428 of Portland sufficiently high to prevent major blast damage to the city,
429 the effects would be a series of concentric circles around the target area.
430 Immediately beneath the blast, most forms of life would be killed 
431 immediatley.  Some secondary radiation ((mostly short lived) would be 
432 induced in the still standing city.  As you move out from the center, death
433 takes longer and longer (up to several days) but is nontheless certain.
434 After you reach a distance where death normally takes a week or more, you
435 will start finding a few survivors.  These persons, while still very ill,
436 will indeed survive the effects of the flood of neutrons.  As we travel
437 farther and farther from the target area, the porportion of survivors to
438 those who die increases until the LD50 line is crossed.  At this point, 
439 50% of the population survives the detonation of one weapon.  This line
440 is generally accepted as the working radius of the weapon.  The figures
441 I have heard for neutron weapons range from 2 to 14 miles kill radius.

445 I was the one who started the idea of the human intelect as a

447 Don't I get any credit?
448 (*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(
449 WELL NOW!
450  
451 TO ABOVE PERSON: SIGN MESSAGE, WILL GIVE CREDIT IMMEDIATELY.
452 
453 TO AARON: AM NOT AND WAS NOT DAVE.
454 
455 TO PAM: REFRESHING TO HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN. WAS INDEED BAT(POOP,GUANO). WAS
456 ALSO SIGNING MY OWN NAME FOR A WHILE BEFORE THAT, BUT GOT PARANOID BECAUSE
457 OF MY CANDID (READ, 'ILL MANNER'D') REMARKS. FIND RELATIVE ANONIMITY THE
458 PERFECT CONDITION FOR RUDE REMARKS. ALSO LETS ONE TELL THE TRUTH MORE
459 EASILY, THOUGH TRUTH IS RARER THAN RUDENESS.
460 
461 TO ANON/ANON 20 : IF YOU GUYS SIGN WITH A NAME LIKE ANONYMOUS, IT'S GONNA
462 CONFUSE US FOR SURE. HOW ABOUT NEW NAMES?
463 
464 TO ALL THE NEW USERS: WELCOME, WECOME, WELCOME. VALCOMMEN. SEE, WE REALLY
465 DID WANT YOU TO JOIN IN. 
466 
467 TO ALL USERS: HOW ABOUT A PARTY FOR BWMS USERS? WOULD IT BE TOO HARD TO
468 BREAK OUR ANONYMITY LIKE THAT? WOULD ANON PUNCH ME OUT AS SOON AS HE 
469 IDENTIFIED ME? WOULD ELBERITCH SPIKE MY TEA WITH CYANIDE? I FEEL I HAVE
470 GOTTEN TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF YOU AND I GENERALLY LIKE WHAT I
471 HAVE FOUND OUT. EVERYBODY COULD CHANGE PSEUDONYMS AFTER IF THEY WANTED TO.
472 FIND OUT ALL THOSE THINGS YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW, LIKE DOES ANON
473 REALLY FILE HIS TEETH INTO SHARP POINTY LITTLE DAGGERS? IS PAM MARRIED?
474 IS MIKEY TOO TALL? DO OVER 50% OF US HAVE BEARDS AND WORN OUT RUNNING
475 SHOES ON? WOULD THEY REALLY SAY THOSE THINGS TO YOU IN PERSON? 
476    WOULD BWMS SURVIVE SUCH A MOVE? PERHAPS IT WOULD BE INVIGORATED, AS
477 SOME SUBJECTS FOR CONVERSATION ARISE NATURALLY FROM THE FACT OF KNOWING
478 SOMEONE. ANONYMITY HAS IT'S SHORTCOMINGS, TOO, AFTER ALL. LEAVE ANSWERS
479 HERE. WE COULD MEET IN A PLACE THAT ALLOWS MIXED ADULTS & MINORS TO 
480 ACCOMODATE THOSE OF THE YOUNGER PERSUASION.

482 TO PAM: SAW 'MEANING OF LIFE', LOVED IT, COULDN'T EAT FOR A WEEK.

491 FROM HODY. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.... SHE IS THE ONE WHO STARTED THE INTELECT 
492 AS A WEAPON. IT WOULD MAKE SENSE ANYWAY. THAT SHOULD READ JODY NOT HODY. Its

586  i am not to be "counseled".  my sole purpose at that meeting will be to
587 re-affirm my stand with Miss Martin. my presence there will be a courtesy
588 i will be extending, not an obligation i will be fulfilling.
589 
590   as for "Vichy" tracking down my new home; it might be of value to
591 remember Miss Martin's condition after she appeared uninvited at my last
592 residence. such a recurrence would indeed be unfortunate, an undoubtedly
593 would entail a significantly higher degree of physical discomfort.

607 Hrothgar:
608 As for my name, I chose Anon (as opposed to Anonymous) since I wanted a 
609 name that was unique, non-obvious, and anonymous.  As long as that other guy remembers to append the characters /20 to his
610 written handle, I don't object.  (but he is showing a lack of originality in names.)  As for an answer to your questions:
611 1.No, I'd use a CBU-72 on you.
612 2.I don't file my teeth, I use #600 silicon carbide sandpaper.
613 3.A BWMS party would be interesting, as you say, but unequal.  Some of already have seen Mikey, and d and PAM would be hard
614 to disguise.  Some of us would be given away by our first names (Jody, Aaron) and so on.  Yet another would be given away by 
615 flashing lights on top of his car.  Only a few of us would be truly unknown/unknowable.  How about going to the Bit Bucket 
616 parties instead?  They will be having one soon.

619 As young men's heart's turn from nuclear war to the fairer things in life,
620 I feel compelled to leave a message from my inner self to one who calls
621 her self by the name of Jody. Ah yes fair maiden, I have read your messages
622 here and on Bit Bucket from afar, and until know have been able to leave you
623 the kind of message you deserve. The sweet sound of your prose brings a smile
624 to my face every time I read it. Your mere presence here amid the bearded
625 tennis shoe porting populace is a welcome change(thnx to who ever said that).
626 You search for a wizard, I seek to become on. I am a mere apprentice now, still
627 going through training and learning of the rituals of life, which are so
628 important to be well versed in these days. From your messages on Bit Bucket, I see you like that collection of shopes and
629 merchants called Clakamas TC. I do too. Let's Dance the night away...you know who sang that dear girl. Please write...Luke |||
