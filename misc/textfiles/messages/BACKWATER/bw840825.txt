20 Golly, where do I start? 
21 Laz: Sorry, I must have overlooked your second quiry. I see no reason why
22 the parties in question can't run again, some states have a law that says
23 that a referendum must receive a minimum amount of votes, or it is
24 considered as not passing, but they can always be resubmitted again, and
25 quite often are in only a slightly modified form in the hopes that they
26 will pass.
27 Also, Mig wasn't the one who stated the 22 mi thing for damage, he was
28 pushing the 200 mile radius. I had offered aprox 20 mile for a 'normal'
29 bomb (Most of the US bombs are in the 10 to 20 MT range (or was the last
30 time I was into that sort of thing.)) 
31 The EMP thing, now there is another often misused figure. Depending on
32 who is talking, you can get just about any figure you want, from limmiting
33 to the blast area, to including the whole world. Well, again we have the
34 problem that it really depends on what your dealing with. Again, the effect
35 deminishes with distance. One of the popular quotes I hear now and then is
36 that you can blow a bomb around 100 miles up and wipe out all the electronic
37 equipment in the US. Not true. What it can do, is to disrupt rf communications
38 for the duration of the blast, and maybe take out a few 'VERY' sensitive
39 pieces of equipment that wasn'T properly protected. To understand what the EMP
40 is, think of a radio transmitter that is messured in the gigiwatts instead 
41 of kilowatts. The protection that is being looked for is for 'near' blasts,
42 (less then a couple of miles or so) outside this area, normal protections
43 devices work to prevent equipment destruction. (the amount of protection, again
44 is dependant upon how much protection was built into the equipment.
45 Most radio equipment is designed to handle sitting at the base of a 100KW
46 xmitter tower without damage (that doesn'T mean it will work while sitting
47 there thouhg, only that it will work after you move it away again.)
48 On your statement re Bog/what's her name AMEN!
49 On your question on archives, you should have a RDCPM program for the Gazelle
50 which allows you to read 8" CPM disks. If you don't have it, I am sure you
51 can get it out of Seattle Computer Products at minimal cost. Then you could
52 get copies of the 8" CPM archive disks.
53 Mig: 200MT huh? the last time I heard, the biggest bomb exploded was a 100MT
54 device by Russia, nor was the 'kill' area anywhere near 200 miles.
55 Even if it was nutron intensive, I don't see how you could get that kind
56 of kill radius.
57 As Laz says, effects are not clasified (not counting a few exceptions) 
58 and you can find out about them by going down to your local library and
59 reading up on them. I had to look up on the EMP thing a couple of years
60 ago on so equipment I was designing, and it was quite readily available
61 if you want to take the time to follow all the leads and weed out the
62 garbage information. As is usually the case in that sort of search, you
63 spend 10 hours to get 10 minutes of usfull info.

75     HI.
76        IS ANYONE INTERESTED IN DESIG-
77   NING A WARGAME(NOT LIKE D&D,LIKE      STARFIRE,ETC.)?
78                    ELRIC OF MELNIBONE
79 """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
80   SURE, ELRIC.
81      I HAVENT PLAYED A WAR GAME BEFFOR BUT I AME A FAST LEARNER.

83                        ASP

85 The EMP can render unusable solid state devices unyill they are repaired,ependin
86 g on a number of factors.The altitude and yield of the explosion, distance
87 what's between it and the EMP ie shielding, etc.This phenomena can also efect
88 non solid state devices. One H Bomb test in the South Pacific disrupted PART
89 of the telephone service in Hawaii, hundreds of mils away. And not just at 
90 the moment of the explosion. There is, so far, no way to totally protect 
91 solid state communications gear. The Air Force found old tube type radios, 
92 nav-com type navigation gear, in a Russian jet figher flown to Formosa (I 
93 believe it was) by a defecting Russian pilot. There are rumors that we, too
94 are using tube type equipment. And they are probabl true. The 22 mile figure
95 I quoted came from a booklet from the E.M.S. At thi distance from ground zero
96 near total destruction of all but specially designe structures would result
97 from a 20 megaton bomb, exploded at altitude. Not a pleasant thought, but 
98 reasonably accurate. Another myth is that a total echange between us and 
99 the USSR would totally destroy the world. Not necesarily. If Dr. Sagan's 
100 theory of the "nuclear winter" is true, then I am wrong, and the population
101 of planet earth would, indeed, perish. If, however, he is wrong, then there
102 will be many survivors. Keep in mind that the Unite States would not be '
103 saturated'. The USSR has about one warhead for every county in America. r
104 haps 1.5. Subtract from that the ones that never ge off the ground, the ones
105 we shoot down with ABM'S, the ones that malfunctionand do not detonate at 
106 altitude from altitude/pressure sensing devices, or remote control, and deto
107 nate from proximity or impact. This significantly rduces their destructive 
108 power. Consider also, that there are a number of high priority targets that
109 WILL be staurated, such as missle bases in the mid-west, Montana, etc; and
110 New York City ( The United Nations Bldg. and center of financial records for
111 many of Americas largest corporations),Omaha, Nebraka, Boulder City, Colordo
112 Washington D.C. All SAC Bases, Chanute, Illinois, Dayton, Ohio, etc etc.n-
113 dustrial areas, Southern California, ( and Beaverton, Oregon, incidentally)
114 That leaves areas of the United States that would be far from being DIRECTLY
115 effected. That does not include other areas of the world, either. Ergo, evn
116 in a total exchange, there is still hope. Many people will survive, at least
117 for some time. I intend to be one of them.
118 Sorry I took up so much line space, but I get into what I am writing---.

193 So you think the "MODERN" Air Force uses tubes huh? Well speaking strictly
194 off the record...... some of the systems I used to work on ( as long as 3
195 years ago ) were of the old tube type. While they were spending all your tax
196 dollars on those high tech jet fighters and fast tanks your nuclear triad
197 was suffering from outdated and outmoded equipment. A typical B-52(D,G,or H)
198 had at least six or so tube type systems. The reason being, that up until a
199 couplr of years ago semiconductor devices were not capable of meeting the
200 high power output requirements and handle the environmental stresses i.e.
201 heat, humidity etc.. not that tubes were cheaper, just more durable under
202 under those circumstances. Oh the horrible storys I could tell, but they
203 are of little interest to most people so I won't feed anyone's paranoia.
204 Getting away from the usual doom and gloom, what ever happened to a person
205 by the name of D.B. Cooper? Things sure have been dull since he left!

246 This sudden surge of infantile language around here has burned my modems'
247 little mike! And what's this "Elric" stuff? SIGH! Did any one catch the 
248 article in the paper the other day about a group of radioactive isotopes
249 that got "lost" at Hanford? They were doing a routine inventory and LO!
250 eight containers with research isotopes were missing since their last use.
251 Ummm, oh yes! When and whereabouts will the next couple of PorSiFiS (is that
252 right?) as I am contemplating a sojourn to one soon. I'd like to meet some
253 you folks and possibly exchange a few thoughts in person. That is, if you
254 can put up with little ol' me. Well, I really must be going, ta ta!
255 ;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;
256 ;-;-;-; : Do they still have 'D's around? when I was working on them in '
257 '73, they were in the process of mothballing them. They had already
258 gotten rid of the 'C's (thatnk god I hated working on them, they were
259 always broken, and the hydrolics leaked over everything.)
260 The equipment I worked on was all tubes, nothing wrong with it either,
261 it was very reliable for what it was. The memory unit was a bunch of
262 servos and gears. not fancy, but it worked. The navigation equipment
263 on the tankers was a hogpodge though, it could have tubes or transistors
264 depending on the aircrafts age, or the last repair job. The older ones
265 used the ASN-6 nav computer which was miniture tubes and servos. When 
266 the later ones used the ASN-7 system which used sub-miniture tubes
267 and a few less servos. Most of the ASN-7 parts were interchangable
268 with the ASN-7A parts which used transistors. The ASN-7 & 7A system
269 was far more reliable and accurate then was the older ASN-6 system.
270 The interesting part was that the nav computer got its update info
271 from the same inertial nav system that the B52 uses. A tube system
272 that provides ground speed and direction information from
273 dopler signals. As you said yes the military does still use tubes,
274 but has nothing to do with EMP, it is simply because it is there,
275 and it works. The same goes with the russians, yes they do have
276 tube equipment in use, simply because they know how to make it
277 and it works reliably.
278 Also, yes an EMP pulse can destroy semis, but I wouldn't worry 
279 about it, since if it was close enough to destroy the semi, it 
280 was also close enough to kill you. What the services are working
281 on is a way for the equipment to survive a near hit with out 
282 destroying the equipment. Outside of that, the EMP pulse is no
283 different then somone firring up a CB set near your radio, it'll
284 mask off reception while they are transmitting, but it will 
285 return to normal as soon as they turn the transmitter off.
286 There can also be additional side effects because of other things
287 though, such as a disruption of the heavyside layer which would 
288 foul HF band radio communications. (But since just about anything
289 can do that, it is no big deal, even the sun does it periodically.)

365 libraries,etc. Are all of them wrong? Hey, Migguy is back!
366 *********************************************************************
367 MIG: I WILL TRY AND SEE IF I CAN DIG UP THE INFO, BUT I DON'T HOLD
368 A LOT OF HOPE, IT WAS 4 YEARS AGO THAT I STUDIED THE THING, AND I
369 WASN'T INTERESTED IN THE EMP RADIUS ASPECT AT THE TIME, ONLY THE
370 THINGS TO DO TO SHIELD AGAINST IT. THIS WAS A PART OF MY SEARCH ON
371 HOW TO PREVENT DISRUPTION OF EQUIPMENT BY STATIC ELECTRICITY. I 
372 CAME ACROSS THE EMP STATS BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT MUCH OF THE THINGS
373 YOU DO TO PREVENT STATIC PROBLEMS ALSO RELATE TO EMP. THEY ARE NOT
374 QUITE THE SAME, BUT THE ASPECTS DO OVERLAP, AND MANY OF THE CURES
375 HANDLE BOTH PROBLEMS. WHEN I GOT DONE, I HAD TAKEN A MULTIPORT
376 COMMUNICATIONS COMPUTER THAT WOULD CROAK IF YOU EVEN LOOKED LIKE
377 YOU MIGHT CONSIDER ZAPPING IT, TO ONE THAT COULD WITHSTAND A DIRECT
378 HIT ON THE IO CABLES WITH SEVERAL BILLION VOLTS AND NOT EVEN HICCUP.
379 I DID LEARN QUITE A FEW THINGS IN THE PROCESS, SUCH AS 74LS273'S 
380 APPARENTLY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO RF, AND WILL CHANGE STATE IF A
381 FIELD IS NEARBY. THE CURE WAS TO USE 74LS173'S INSTEAD. I ALSO
382 FOUND THAT MOST COMPUTERS THAT HAVE STATIC PROBLEMS IS A RESULT OF
383 IMPROPER DESIGN IN THE RS232 INTERFACE. THEY TAKE THE COMMON (PIN 7)
384 AND OFTEN THE CASE GROUND (PIN 1) AND ROUTE IT THRU THE LOGIC GROUND
385 SO THAT WHEN THE STATIC DISCHARGE HITS THE RS232 CABLE IT FOLLOWS
386 THE GROUND RIGHT TO THE LOGIC AND DOES NASTY THINGS TO YOUR COMPUTER.
387 THE COMMON GROUND SHOULD BE ROUTED DIRECTLY TO THE POWER SUPPLY 
388 GROUND, NOT THRU THE LOGIC GROUND. AND THE CASE GROUND SHOULD GO
389 DIRECTLY TO THE CASE, AGAIN NOT TIED TO THE LOGIC GROUND. (OR
390 HORRORS OF HORRORS, LEFT OPEN!). THIS ADDED TO INSTALLING TRANSORBS
391 ON EVERY LINE THAT GOES TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND DOING SOME LOGIC
392 REWIRING TO IMPROVE THE NOISE MARGINS INSIDE THE BEAST CHANGED A
393 CRIPPLE INTO A FIGHTER. 
394 AS FAR AS THE DISRUPTION OF THE HAWIAN PHONE SYSTEM, IT IS POSSIBLE.
395 I DIDN'T SAY IT COULDN'T BE DISRUPTTED. WITH A STRONG ENOUGH BLAST
396 IT COULD BE, WHAT WILL NOT HAPPEN THOUGH (ASSUMING THERE IS A
397 REASONABLE AMOUNT OF PROTECTION ON THE EQUIPMENT) IS THE DESTRUCTION
398 OF THAT EQUIPMENT. THERE IS NOTHING SPEACIAL ABOUT THE EMP, IT
399 ISN'T SOME NEW AND FANCY FORCE THAT MAN HAS CREATED. IT HAS BEEN
400 AROUND SINCE THE BEGINING OF TIME. AS THE LETTERS STAND FOR,
401 IT IS AN 'ELECTROMAGNECTIC PULSE'. THE SAME PROTECTION SCHEMES
402 YOU USE TO PROTECT AGAINST EXCESSIVE RF INTERFERANCE WORKS AGAINST
403 THE EMP (WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE PROTECTION SCHEME TO WORK OF COURSE)
404 IT IS NOTHING MORE THEN AN EXTREMLY STRONG BURST OF RF ENERGY THAT
405 IS CREATED BY THE BOMB GOING OFF. AS SUCH IT HAS THE SAME DISTANCE
406 DISAPATION EFFECTS THAT NORMAL RF HAS.

468 Prometheus : No...no...no... I was merely stating my opinion, not your condition. On the contrary, you seem like anything
469 but stupid. You may babble, as some call it, but at least it is interesting babble, with a light humorous touch, and not
470 the heavy handed insulting abusive stuff we see so much of lately. Everything in the past aside, if you really are
471 interested in the archives, come Saturday, and we can discuss it in an atmosphere more condusive to verbal communication.
472 Alex : Yes...I agree with voyeur. I feel like nuking something, like the plant that produces vile orange liquid, and the
473 person who put Japan so close to the edge of the board! As for stocks, so you seem to feel the current comeback, which
474 by the way seems to have trailed off a bit, is a function of the season, and not any real long lasting economic brightening.
475 (Is there a long lasting anything in the stock market.) After looking recently at a blue chip preferred list, I noticed the
476 names of a few perennials were missing. It seems that a few of our old friends the blue chip boys seem to be having some 
477 problems. Some technology stock really took a dip in the recent slackening on that market. An associate at work had 300
478 shares of Tandy, purchased at 35. It climed to around 70, did a two-for-one split, back to 35 or so, climed to about 50, then
479 sank like a weighted rock to aorund it present 26 or so. He dumped most of it right after the two for one. He kept 50 or so
480 shares, and is sitting it out for now. I guess he forgot the "magic" 10 percent margin on buying price, and is keeping the 
481 stuff out of love for the company(!)
482 I personally only have 20 shares of Detroit Edison Preferred. It was a gift from a grandmother I can barely remember (too
483 young). The dividends are more like a little surprise when they come. And I do get the pretty annual report. I really don't
484 have the money yet to get too involved in the stock market. I don't want to be another stock nerd and buy a few stocks
485 and say I am "playing the market". If I ever get into the market, I want to do it right. A good spread of shares. A nice 
486 complete portfolio. But...there are those people who buy a few stocks on a whim, like Teledyne, at $10 per share, and...
487 the re$t i$ Hi$tory.

492 UNKNOWN:"migguy" has always been here, just sometimes I chose not to reply to
493 obvious taunting because I know where it leads.
494 Mikey again:The Psuedo-RS-232 I am using is direct connect with a 6803 processor
495 chip. Should rampant RF hit near here, what kind of buffering should I use?
496 When I had my 212A I had to boost the line voltage to +-12 instead of the +5/0
497 its currently at,`I used`2N2222's in the classic switch`configuration, would those
498 be enough? I took them out do to power supply getting a wee bit warm and throwing
499 .5 volt`60hz spikes after a few hours of operation.

505 voyeur,
506         Ahhhh  .... a few games of Risk would be just what the system needs !.
507 You pick the time and I got the spot........Riskers...Are you up for it ?
508 Is it PCS this weekend ? I may make it this time....Once preempted twice shy.
509        " We be Brown "..Funny you should ask..I have heard speculation that 
510 " We be brown " is a low level greeting response of objects & insects who are
511 highly resistant to many forms of subtle persuasion, torture and environmental
512 toxicity. The phrase originated from a radical splinter group called the 
513 Bronzeneeshies whose sole belief is the total superiority of the heavier
514 elements in the periodic table. Their goal to A) convert all elements to 
515 an atomic weight of more than 232.038 or  B) Reduce them to a weight of 
516 1.00797. To that end they have been only partialy sucessfull. However
517 they have been quite lucky in the insect community, with several converts 
518 of the Blattaria order. In terms of higher life forms their only notable 
519 disciple has been Foster Grant. There are rumors that Leica of Germany and
520 Tamaron of Japan have shown interest. But as of yet there has been no
521 official corporate endorsement.
522  
523 MiG,
524         I should have a partial list of prerequisites soon...I have spoken 
525 to a few participants ( judges,referees etc. ) albeit in an oblique fashion 
526 and they support both the target price & concept.........heh heh...
527 The official algorithms will soon be in my posession. Complete with 
528 penalty configurations and percentages.

530 L'homme,
531 Sept S/F went through 43.10 yesterday but settled back ....Dec can't be
532 far behind.....Risk ! ! !  Sure ......When.

535 MIKEY: If you are checking for the EMP info, please also check "Magnetic Pulse"
536 & "Magnetic Inhomogenities". It is possible to build a bomb out of an electrical
537 power source & some explosive that will create a "mag pulse" capable of scrambling any
538 disks, tapes, core, etc. AND capable of ruining electronic gear if said gear is
539 too close. (induced current flows). 
540 I used to have info on a suitcase sized device that would ruin magnetic
541 storage at 100+ feet, & kill electronic gear at about 20. 
542 L'homme: I now have 50 disks for the archives. Do they have to be formatted? 
543 Leave reply here AND on CBBS/NW (and Bit Bucket if you log onto it!)

547 hours, and says nothing. Nobody listens, and then eeryone disagrees. Will 
548 Rogers. 
549 Migguy, you can install a PC board in the CPU socket. It has two switchable
550 ZIF sockets, in which you can put parallel 6809EMP's. A lead cover comes with
551 the kit. This will afford substantial protection frm nuclear explosion genrd
552 EMP's, citizens banders, and some protection if you live within six blocks
553 of Mikey. The position independant characteristics of the 6809MPE are helpful
554 as you can access data that might otherwise have ben lost. Are you the SYSOP
555 of the NERDOLUX? I can't access it. Was is los mit das Nerdoluxishboard?

581 except that you got lower case. I used to be an upper case only semi backwater irregular, and everyone hated me. Now I have

588 it's way to the bone yard. Castle and March lost a couple of 'em before old
589 uncle Sam decided to ground them. I personaly watched one come in with only
590 three landing gear in position. Amazingly, nobody got hurt. ASN 7 huh? Last
591 time I fixed one of those was before it was due to go to a depot upgrade.
