22 THE INN, WIPING SLOWLY AT A NONEXISTANT SPOT ON THE GLASS HE HELD. THEN
23 HE HEARD THE OLD OAKEN DOOR AT THE ENTRANCE CREAK OPEN. LOOKING UP HE SAW 
24 THAT IT WAS PAM WHO HAD ENTERED! THE GLASS SLIPPED UNNOTICED FROM HIS SLACK 
25 HAND AND CRASHED TO THE FLOOR. DUMBFOUNDED HE STOOD WITH HIS LOWER JAW 
26 SLACK, AN EXCELANT HOME FOR FLIES. FINALLY HE REGAINS A DEGREE OF COMPOSURE 
27 AND CRUNCHING OVER THE BROKEN GLASS STEPS OUT FROM BEHIND THE BAR TO 
28 PROPERLY GREET PAM. GRASPING HER HAND AND PUMPING IT FURIOUSLY HE EXCLAIMED;

63      Here's a slightly out of phase comment, has anybody out

68 Well, it's for real... KAMASBBS is on the air.  For those of you who tried
69 it recently we've already got rid of a couple of bugs.  Also, we've added
70 a KAMASBBS User's Guide.  After you give your name and password--anything
71 will do; no security is checked, you can follow the instructions on show-
72 ing the User's Guide to learn how to use this new kind of BBS.  It's a
73 BBS that allows messages to be organized in a tree structure.  The terms
74 used in KAMAS can be confusing if you haven't heard about the tree analogy.
75 Anyway, be patient...give it a try...let us know what you think.  It's
76 experimental--we'er ironing out the bugs.  
77  
78 In KAMAS, all the messages are kept in structured text files call topics.
79 Each topic can be thought of as a tree of text.  The basic unit of text
80 is called the stem.  Stems consist of a title and a leaf.  The leaf is
81 just straight linear text (up to 2420 chars).  The title is in turn
82 made up of a key and a subtitle.  When you insert new messages to grow
83 the topic tree, you are prompted for each of these elements.  The key
84 must be less than 31 characters; the leaf entry is terminated by two
85 RETURNS in a row.  Don't type Control-C, like here, it will abort your
86 entry and you'll have to reenter.  The keys are for later rapid retrieval.
87 Pick descriptive ones.  As we've currently got it set up there are
88 two topics available: BBSMESSAGES and CONFERENCES.  When you first get on
89 KAMASBBS you'll find yourself in the BBSMESSAGES topic.  We've started
90 a few common sense branches in it.  
91  
92 Sooo, for a new kind of BBS adventure: Try KAMASBBS at 227-xxxx after
93 6PM in the evenings mostly.  Sponsored by Chuck Hughes and Adam Trent.

96 To the above...And what about Steve Neighorn becuase he was there??? How 
97 quickly they forget... Hey Hrothgar...I worked on the programs today...and
98 I made some good progress. Got alot of graphics to do, and I will try to gget
99 to them this week. I have had one heck of a time getting on here...it seems
100 as if things are getting quite popular.
101 ...and as the image fades to the crowded tavern...
102 To all respective reality travelers...Although I am sure I.R.S. offers fine
103 service, I have found a much better deal for the great deal of reality
104 travel I do each year. Ever since the division of the Galactic Rules
105 Committee that deals withh reality (I think it is the GSA) eased off on motst
106 of the regulations on reality travel, a host of smaller cheaper companies h
107 have sprung up all over the cosmos. One of these companies, Air Cal-
108 Reality, I am happy to say gives good service at good prices. Their
109 in-flight
110 training is excellent, as well as the stews...(boy those green women from
111 gamma 7 sure have an effect on me!)
112 Anyway...Before going with a big expensive outfit like I.R.S., you might
113 look into Air Cal-Reality...
114 "Hello alchemist", je m'appelle L'homme sans parity. I am here in this time
115 frame for some further training on 20th century computer science. Sure I
116 know it is crude by most standards, in my time almost all toasters have the
117 equivalance of a Cray X-MP in them, but hey...what the heck.. Many  people
118 have a love of history, and I guess I fall into that company also. Maybe we
119 can talk about trans-axle inducers and bi-polar irridation units sometime
120 when you have a chance. I trip up the Kolumbia (i think the natives spell
121 it differently) would be great. One must be careful though, there are a
122 few power generating structures that block the way in certain places. Again
123 a throwback to the past, but in this time frame such contrivances are deemed
124 necessary. I will offer all the assitance I can. How 'bout a portable navi-
125 computer. Although it is usually used for time-space dialation problems
126 and hyper-space jumps, I think I can tweak it for surface navigation. And
127 since YOU seem to know something about the type of craft used on the
128 Kolumbia, how about stepping forward as leader?
129 How 'bout the rest of you? Are you game for a trip up the Kolumbia? Taverns
130 are fun for awhile, but I would like to get outside under the cool grey skies
131 for awhile...

191   "Come on everyone!!"  the piper leaped up from his chair.  "PAM has 
192 returned to the inn and we are not there to greet her!  To the waterfront!"
193   The piper rushed out of the door of the drinking establishment, not pausin
194 to see who followed.  The rest of the party erupted from the doorway in a
195 tangle of arms, legs, and beer glasses.  The piper paused about half way 
196 down the first block.  Which way was the waterfront??  Ahhh, downhill, of 
197 course.  At least the rain had stopped.  Now if they could find someone
198 who would part with a watercraft!

218 The bard and Fast Freddie had been huddled in a corner, discussing

243     He began mixing his response. Beginning of course with I.R.P. psi-logo.
244 To which he merged several pans of " Innisfall " in various states and 
245 intensity. Adding his own thoughts to the flowing channel. And finishing

261     Finally arriving at the docks, I picked a likely sucker, and went to
262 work.  "Greetings, friend, Allow me to introduce myself.  The name is Fred,
263 and as I see it, this is your lucky day.  My friends and I have been put in
264 the situation of needing a transport upstream."  I could see that he thought
265 that I was quite mad.  I continued, "I suppose, of course, that you have heard
266 of the recent gold discovery upstream.  Well, we are out to make our fortune
267 and need to get upstream fast."
268      He finally began to speak, "there's no gold up there....."
269 He stopped when I held aloft a large gold coin, one which would get almost
270 nothing back at the backwater, "this, of course, would be only half payment,
271 the rest of which would be yours upon arrival......"

281 I don't think we're really in the Portland we think we're in. The
282 Doctor's TARDIS never goes to the right place. Something had to pull it
283 there. I've been recieving messages from PAM. I thought she was imprisoned.
284 When I was back at the Inn, I heard a strange voice warning me off the
285 powers of a man called George MathKneeBiter SlimeHopper. Strange. Almost
286 sounds familar.
287                  The Ninja

289 
290 "Fred," I wisper as I pull him out of the weeeling and dealing for 
291 a moment, "Just give him this and get rid of him." I pull out a diamond
292 and point towards the owner of the boat, a nice 40' cabin cruser.
293 "I picked up a about 30 pounds of these once and have stashed them in 
294 all sorts of places. Let me know if you wish to trade for a few. The
295 price is non-negotiable, period."
296 
297    Freddy goes back to dealing, after a few minutes the owners face
298 lights up and he disappears.
299 
300    I head towards the small bridge and motion everybody aboard,
301 starting the twin desiel engines, as I call to the piper to throw the 
302 lines off.   It is the perfect day for a trip up the Columbia River 
303 Gorge. (I know the geography of this area well, if not the political 
304 structure). I think I noticed a small bar in the cabin of the boat, 
305 Hmmm, I see the others have already found it...
306

309      Suddenly everyone in the place jumped up and started for the door at
310 the same instant. The alchemist was taken by surprise and carried along in
311 the wake of the thundering throng. As everyone was being extruded through
312 the door his foot caught on the edge of the sill and he went sprawling 
313 onto the sidewalk. A magnetic bottle containing about two thirds of a pint
314 of 'alkahest' bounced out of his tunic and went rolling down the street.
315 "Don't let that thing get near a strong electromagnetic field that might
316 affect the seal!", he yelled. He turned to the BARD and said, "One can't
317 be too careful with that stuff; just one drop on the loose and this 
318 trans-reality is in big trouble. We had one heck of a time containing it
319 in the first place."  He retrieved the bouncing container and headed down
320 toward the river with the rest of the crowd.
321   
322      As they went rushing down the hill he turned to his right and said,
323 "L'homme, I do appreciate your suggestion, but it seems the piper has
324 already set things in motion. I must say I'm a bit relieved."
325 He was in fact just getting his bearings in this reality, but he already
326 knew that Leader here sometimes became synonomous with Target. At this
327 time he would just as soon go along with the crowd and make whatever
328 small contribution seemed appropriate. Besides being in such a position
329 might afford more time to DUCK when the action starts, as it is prone to
330 do without warning.
331   
332      Arriving at the dock he found that Fast Fred was standing on one
333 of the strangest water craft he had ever seen. It looked as though
334 someone had build about twenty different shapes and sizes of rooms and
335 then stacked them helter skelter on a large floating platform. There
336 was a large deck forward and some sort of huge engine mounted on the
337 stern. He hoped that it had a zillion horsepower. It would certainly
338 need it to propel this monster. It was painted in a variety of colors,
339 with several interesting scenes painted on the sides of some of the
340 rooms. Fred was having a lively discussion with someone who was
341 probably the present owner. He turned and said, "Get out that bag of
342 GOLD of yours and pay this person off. We've no time to dally around."
343 
344      Things were really starting to happen fast now. Some people were
345 casting off the lines and there was someone forward at the wheel that
346 looked like the apprentice or the BARD. The alchemist turned toward
347 the Ninja and said, "Hook those davits on that TARDIS and get it aboard
348 if you want to have it along." Turning to the right he continued,
349 "Traveller do you think that cruiser tied along side will be a good skiff
350 for this larger craft? or if necessary we can all pile aboard the cruiser
351 and make the trip in no time at all. But what are we going to do with this
352 more comfortable conveyance? In any case let us be underway.", So saying he
353 stepped forward and looked out over the river called 'Will-A-Mutt'.

376     WHAT IS WRONG? Is the system in a depression? Why are there so few 
377 chapters being written? Must be mass hypnosis..........
378     Maybe a new topic would help...... 
379 The question: What does the Biblical prophesy that Jesus will return "on the
380 clouds" really mean? ......an extension.. Can we assume from the Bible that
381 when Jesus returns, everyone in the world will know it immediatly? Over a 
382 span of a generation? 10? How long did it take Jesus to become world-known
383 in his first tour?

389 Hvor boegen luder, lys og sval, der sang i maj en nattergal.
390 Den lokked i den lyse kvaeld og kaldte med set tonevaeld:
391 Du hvem mit hjerte stunder til,
392 svar mig isdkoven hvis du vil.
393 Du vil? Du vil? du hvem mit jherte stunder til.
394 
395 Og ekko i den stille dal,
396 hvor natten lyste, oem og sval,
397 gav svar paa nattergalens roest som fra et fjaelet fuglebryst.
398 Vil du min enesang forstaa?
399 min tone, vil du den forsmaa:
400 Du maa! du maa! du vil min enesang forstaa.
401 
402 Alt hvad derr svandt, i mindets skaer er for bestandig lige naer.
403 Hvad der erinderer sig bestaar.
404 Kun hvad der er forglemt forgaar.
405 Min skoenne ungeliv, forbliv!
406 forbliv, min skoenne unge liv!

410 "Oooooohhhhhhhhh....."
411 This was getting to be a habit. One minute he was having a few friendly drinks in a tavern, the next he was waking
412 up in some strange place with the King's own hangover. If the ground would only hold still...
413 "Hey! Back among the living, I see!"
414 He knew that voice... It took a few seconds for his mind to bridge the gap left by a few billion alchohol-killed
415 neurons. "Graymalkin! Where are we?"
416 "On the oddest excuse for a boat I've ever seen. We just passed into this big river from a smaller one. There seems
417 to be something magical upstream, and we're giong to find out what it is."
418 Well, at least that explained why the floor kept moving. But why was he having such trouble with his memory? It
419 reminded him of something, but what? Of course! He thought that disease was mythical, but something in the nature 
420 of this reality had brought it out in him.
421 "Gray, dear friend, I must ask you a very strange favor. No matter how much I beg you, don't let me have another
422 beer or ale or glass of wine until we leave this reality. Apparently something in this world has triggered off an
423 allergic reaction in me to alchohol. I've never suffered the like before, though I hear it's quite common in some
424 realities. This must be one of them. Now, please excuse me but I feel a sudden need to visit the railing."
425 With that, the Poet turned and ran to the craft's port side. It's not fair, he thought as he listened to his 
426 companions singing drunkenly to the Piper's music, I was just beginning to like the stuff they drink here, too...

432 Aaron..Medical reasons eh? Ha! I bet! By the way, the graphics system I
433 was speaking of is the CT5 system - Evans & Sutherland Computer Corporation.
434 The Redifon flight simulator generate F-16's in real time 30 frames/second, and
435 the image is remarkable!
436 Play chess? I have a program rated 1900, wanna play a game?
437 #$"$"#$#"$
438 As I ran along with the rest of the group, I wondered about my schedule at
439 school. How many programming assignments and pop quizes would I miss? Oh well,
440 the midterms aren't for another 2 weeks, and I hope our adventure is done
441 by them. Reaching the boat, I had to look twice to make sure that was the
442 craft we were going to sail on. "Are you sure this is the one?
443 closest person to me, "Yup...Fast Fred should have the matter closed in just
444 a few minutes", someone answered. "Oh well, I'll just make the best of it,
445 it sure is different than the pontoon boats of epsilin delta in the orion
446 system! After getting on board, and before partaking of ale (always ale eh?)
447 I wanted to do a little exploring. On a boat this big, who knows what one will
448 find. I managed to find a locked door to one of the cabins below. I used a
449 handy little trick I had picked up here in this reality, and picked the lock.
450 "I guess those TV dectective shows are good for something afterall..."
451 Behind the door (which by the way was painted green), I found something that
452 caused me to yell for anyone of the others... "Come quick!!! You are not
453 going to believe what I found!!! Come quick!!!..."

468   The piper relaxed again.  His companions were merrymaking and paid no 
469 attention to his tunes.  He liberated a cold bottle that someone named Henry
470 had placed on a private hunting ground.  Paying no attention to the shouts 
471 about a "Green Door" (the piper felt that sex made a very poor spectator sport,
472 and got bored observing rather quickly.  There was one occasion in a warmer
473 climate however...) he made his way to the deck on the forepart of this floating
474 conglomeration.  He really prefered sail power to the loud, stinking infernal
475 combustion engines that this reality seemed addicted to.  Oh well, with a 
476 little luck and perserverance, they could change realities soon.
477 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
478 aaron--
479   Gulp!  You caught me quite unprepared.  I really don't know what to thini
480 about the prophecy of "Christ returning on a cloud."  You see, I gave up
481 Christianity for Lent about 20 years ago.  I have felt very little loss in
482 the ensuing time.  (Mind you, I am not anti-Christian, if you want to believe
483 in christ's "virgin birth" go right ahead.  (And I will not dispute the fact
484 that Christ is the "son of God", just that that is an EXCLUSIVE title.))
485 Oh dearie me -- my english teacher would never approve of those stacked 
486 parenthesis.  (And they would never qualify me to work on ((((LISP)))).)

534 "Just a moment, Whisper." said the apprentice. "Monsieur, I believe I can
535 aid you." he removed a book from his pouch....
536 "Ah, here it is, 'bilocation'! Now, would you prefer to be here and in
537 class SIMULTANEOUSLY, or SEQUENTIALLY? The latter involves a finite time-loop,
538 while the former involves a slight risk of disorientation."
539 ...........
540 "I would not worry, my friend. We are going up the Kulumbia River
541 to a site several of us have sensed. It is some sort of henge, about 30 leagues
542 from this city."

585 is simply no room for artistic lisense.
586 Well anyway, I managed to build up enough courage to enter the room without
587 the other adventurers, and examine what I had found. The room seemed to be
588 some sort of storage place for devices of the occult. One the floor was
589 painted a giant pentegram. On the walls hung shrunken heads and broom
590 sticks. There were tarot cards, crystal balls, reagnets and potions of
591 every kind (including eye of knute rockne and leg of lamb). Ancient books
592 with titles I couldn't even pronounce were stacked neatly on a bookshelf
593 to my left. A crate of small black pots lines another wall, and above
594 them were several cartons labeled "VOODOO - 100 GROSS". There were also
595 several mind altering drugs in labaled containers next to the voodoo
596 cartons. "That's one thing they don't teach us in school...witch craft
597 and black magic. I can't even learn all this stuff from Ozzy Osbourne!",
598 I muttered to myself. "I better find someone who knows more about this
599 stuff. We might have stumbled onto a 'black' market smuggeling operation
600 here."  Just how much did Fast Fred pay for this crate anyway? I closed
601 and locked the door, but not before taking a jar of some weird chemical,
602 a voodoo doll from one of the packages, and a couple small books from
603 the shelf, and stuffing them all into by ever-present ever bulging back
604 pack. I hurried up to the deck, and set about to find the expert I was
