10 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
11 I may find offensive. Because of the limited size of the system, it will be

21 THUS, IF YOU TRY TO ACCESS IT, IT WILL HANG UP. REQUIRING YOU TO HANGUP
22 AND CALL BACK IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE. THE DISK WILL BE RETURNED TOMORROW
23 NIGHT (THR 11 OCT 84).
24 ABOUT BWMS, POINT ONE, I WILL NOT DO ANY WORK ON IT MYSELF. I DON'T HAVE THE
25 TIME TO DO SO. NOR WILL I DO ANY HARDWARE MODIFICATIONS. OF COURSE I AM
26 NOT AGAINST ANYONE PUTTING UP THEIR OWN BWMS SYSTEM. THE QUIRY THAT WAS
27 BROUGHT UP WAS WHETHER SOMEONE WANTED TO DO THE MADDNESS. ACTUALY, WE
28 COULD USE ANOTHER BWMS TO TAKE THE LOAD OFF OF HERE. NOT TO MENTION
29 BEING ABLE TO SPREAD THE FAME BY HAVING SOFTWARE THAT COULD BE PROVIDED
30 TO OTHER COMPUTER FREAKS THAT IS USEABLE.

33 MADE IT ITO THE TOP (Mikey doesn't count.)
34 If anyone is interested in doing some BWMS-type stuff on a VERY different system, try dialing ATE-BYTE (the ph#
35 spells that). It's a BBS running in an outline-processor format. It can be very confusing, (it took me FOREVER to 
36 get the hang of it) but once you figure out the basics of it it's quite rewarding. The Sysop there just modified
37 the welcome file so that everyone gets a simple instruction guide to the system at the beginning.  There's an entire
38 outline area (called "Topic") dedicated to BWMS-style fiction. Just <G>o <K>ey <fiction> to get to the top of it,
39 then use <S><K> to see the outline. Oh, heck, why am I detailing it here? Call it, the basic instructions scroll
40 past you automatically.

42 The poet was pleased to find the Inn less crowded than it had been of late. There must be an adventure on, he 
43 thought, all my favorite regulars seem to be gone. Hmm, maybe I can check on them...
44 First checking the room to make certain no-one was looking his way, the Poet slipped his hand into one of the large
45 pockets in his robe, pulling it open and gazing into it. Ahh, there was the Piper and that French fellow, on some 
46 sort of flying horse. Oops, they were straying a bit too close to his pocket's field; better damp down the power 
47 level. Having them trying to fly out of his pocket would be somewhat uncomfortable, to say the least. Crap. The 
48 field transient had moved them several reality-tracks away from where they wanted to be. They're lost for sure, now.
49 Wait... Piper's flying back towards the field... maybe a little boost to the translator... there. That was a bit 
50 tricky, there, but now they were back where they'd started. A near thing, too: as he'd translated them across the
51 interference from an alternate Poet taking similar action in an adjacent reality had almost set up a feedback...
52 Shuddering at the thought of what a reality feedback would do to things, the Poet released his pocket and signalled
53 the Innkeeper for his usual seven ales. Feedback! He hoped there weren't any sensitive reality-shifts going on in
54 Piper's current reality. The interference could have set up a standing wave... and that could make things pretty 
55 hairy for afew hours...

57  
58 OK, anybody else want in on the "Great Backwater Re-Write"?
59 	As a start, I'd say that we should implement some sort of "marker"
60 similar to the one that lets BW know where the next line is. The marker would
61 indicate which lines had been entered BEFORE the current caller. This could
62 be used to protect previous entries from deletion etc.
63 	In any case the first priority will be to get schematics & source code
64 for the CURRENT system!
65 	Anybody got a prom reader? I've got both 8080 & Z-80 disassemblers...
66 _____________________________________Leonard____________________________________
67 ps. Mikey, if we do get a group going on this would there be any problem using
68 the system you had at OMSI for testing?

77 DAWN: NO ONE SAYS YOU CAN'T CONTINUE YOUR DEBATE JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE
78 IS OFF ADVENTURING. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE SEVERAL THOUGHTLINES FLOWING
79 IN BWMS AT ONCE. ADMITTEDLY IT MAKES IT A LITTLE HARDER TO KEEP TRACK OF
80 THINGS, BUT MOST PEOPLE SOON LEARN TO SKIP PAST THOSE THINGS THEY DON'T
81 REALLY CARE ABOUT. I HOPE THIS DOESN'T PUT YOU OFF OF BWMS ALTOGETHER,
82 WE NEED TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE GROUP HERE, OR IT SINKS INTO A POCKET OF
83 ITS OWN SELF INTERESTS. ACTUALLY BARING ANY OTHER CONCEPTS FROM BEING
84 INTRODUCED. AND THAT IS MOST DEFINATLY NOT WHAT TJIS BBS IS ABOUT.
85 BWMSERS: I HAVE SCHEMATICS, NO PROBLEM THERE. AND YES, WE COULD PROBABLY
86 COBBLE UP SOMTHING FOR WORK IF SO DESIRED. ALSO, GIVE THE IDEA OF AN
87 ENTIRLY NEW SYSTEM A THOUGHT TOO, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A REPLACEMENT
88 AND OR UPGRADE OF VENERABLE OL' BWMS, EVEN A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM SOMEWHERE
89 ELSE MIGHT BE MORE ATRACTIVE. THE IDEA IS TO USE THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED HERE
90 TO MAKE A BETTER BBS OF THE BWMS STYLE.

102     Slowly the sun became a huge orange sphere, as it floated toward the
103 infinite line that separated sea and sky. As far as the eye could reach in
104 any direction, not a mortal artifact in sight. Nothing to mar the perfection
105 of that infinite curve. Here one could fully embrace the feeling of peace.
106 How strange, he mused to himself. He had friends who found this same feeling
107 of contentment living in the mountains of timber country. Maybe, just maybe,
108 he might see some of them at the Backwater Inn. Both feelings had one thing
109 in common. Relating the feeling to someone who has never been there was
110 nearly impossible. I guess it's just one of those things a person has to go
111 experience for themselves. High on a mountain side, or far at sea, there is
112 room to look as far outward or inward as a person desires.

114     'Southwind' was clipping along at a steady eight and a half knots, close
115 reaching, on the last tack, for the entrance to that famous river. A easy
116 slide up river to that cove near the Inn and... In the fading light a darker
117 line rose jaggedly out of the sea across the eastern horizon. It continued
118 to loom out of the misty haze that had occupied that quadrant of the world
119 most of the day. The ancient practitioner sprang up from his daydreaming 
120 and reached below to grab both chart and long glass. Tomorrow morning was
121 when he expected to make landfall. Was it possible? Suddenly a word sprang
122 into his mind, `CURRENTS?'. "Oh!  <bleep>", he exclaimed aloud.

159   Since I couldn't get to drive 'b' to see what happened since the last
160 entry, (yes, Virginia, it DOES hang fire!!) I'll wait for a while to 
161 make another adventure contribution.
162   On the subject of a BWMS replacement -- with more code space to work
163 with, shouldn't we think about a little more efficient text storage?
164 I could suggest several things:
165   1.  A fairly compatible format such as Incred. Big Money 360k 5 1/4"
166   2.  Consider the entire disk as one file -- use CR or LF to deliniate
167       lines rather than 1 line/sector.
168   3.  Similar (simple) command interface.
169   4.  Don't get carried away with frills.  Lots of the BWMS charm is the
170       basic simplicity of the format.  (KISS)
171   5.  (storage efficiency) how about some sort of runlength encoding for
172       things like borders or blank lines?
173 'nuffa that stuff.  Now if I can just get this beast to behave....
174 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
175 Piper: Since I have been 'designing' a BW like system for a while I have a
176 few points you might consider.
177 1. To keep the ability to edit lines AND to start reading at any line, the
178    easiest soltion is a 'Random-Access' file with fixed record lengths. 
179    (essentially what BW uses now) Sequential files are a LOT harder to code.
180 2. Since I have 256 byte sectors on my equipment, I'd consider 2 lines per
181    sector. (Or perhaps 48 lines/track. that would be 96 char/line)
182 3. I see nothing wrong with the current command set. (Some of the quirks
183    should be straightened out though)
184 4. With 180k SSDD 5 1/4" disks and 2 "lines" per sector (plus a LOT of system
185    overhead) I could put 1398 "lines" on a disk. Remember, the only reason BW
186    has such a "small" amount of storage is that it is on a 35 track SINGLE
187    density system! On a 40 track DOUBLE density system we might have TOO MUCH
188    room.
189 	Note: I may try putting up a BASIC version of BW on one of my machines.
190 If I do, I will give the number out to SOME of the patrons of BW. Since it
191 will only be a part-time test I will NOT generally release the number! (If the
192 test works out then MAYBE I'll get a second phone line etc)

194 I know that there are other places to post this message but... since Im here
195  
196 I am trying to put together a CP/M system but lack the most important parts.
197 I have a 10 Megabyte Hard Disk Drive (5 1/4in.) and a few assorted trading
198 items such as, 40 character by 4 lines - display panels, with logic boards &
199 interface and power supply, large collection of ICs, A-to-D Converters, and
200 a couple of boards for a PDP-8 (CRT Controller, Bootstrap Loader)
201 Am looking for an S-100 card cage+power supply and or anything that will be
202 useful in this project.
203 The sooner I can find a system, the sooner Powerhouse Information Exchange
204 will be back online in Portland. Am also going to run a modified copy of the
205 under-distributed version of CITADEL.
206 Any help would be appreciated.                    Robert Kulbe

214 ***********************************************************************
215 LEONARD: ONE THING YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER IS NOCKING THE LINE LENGTH
216 DOWN EVEN FURTHER (72 CHAR PER LINE) YOU DO THIS BY BREAKING IT INTO
217 64 CHAR CHUNKS, THEN ENCODE THE REMAINING 8 CHAR IN THE BIT 8'S OF THE
218 64 CHARS. THIS WAS DONE ON A VERSION OF THE SYSTEM THAT BWMS RUNS ON
219 UNFORTUNATLY, I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET THE CODE TO DO IT WITH. IT DID DOUBLE
220 THE DATA SPACE THOUGH. THERE WAS ALSO A VERISON THAT RAN ON DOUBLE SIDED
221 DRIVES TOO BUT NEVER DOUBLE DENSITY. THE EQUIPMENT WAS OBSOLETE BY THE TIME
222 DDENS BECAME POPULAR. (IE WORKING 1791'S WERE AVAILABLE)
223 ANYWAY, IT'S A THOUGHT...
224 
225 ALL: ARGHHHH! THE DRIVE B WAS RECOVERED (EASY TO DO, JUST THROW
226 IT ON MY CPM SYSTEM AND RUN MY UNDEL PROGRAM) BUT, I SEEM TO HAVE LEFT
227 IT LAYING ON MY DESK. SO... IT WON'T BE BACK UNTIL TOMORROW. IN THE 
228 MEAN TIME I'LL LEAVE THE PREVIOUS DISK IN B SO YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING
229 THERE TO FILL THE VOID. SORRY 'BOUT THAT.

233 Hmmm... another BWMS... well, sorry, I cannot help, unless you're doing it on an Apple or a Commode (and I gather you're
234 not).  1000+ lines a disk sounds good, but it would be a little hard to find things after awhile.  How about increasing
235 the line length a little, so there would be about 800 or so lines?
236 The idea of the delete pointer is a good one, also... then you could add 'delete a range of numbers' and not allow 
237 deleting of other's entries.
238 Leonard: May I have that number?  If so, I believe you have my number again or you could post it in the old code.  I 
239 never have the time to really go at the new one.  I have the feeling you use more than one system at once... as a guess,
240 i'd say it was run through a polyalphabetic table and then run through a transposition block.  If another guess of mine
241 is right, there are 3,628,000 shift combinations AFTER the keyword encryption.  Am I hitting close?
242 +++++++++++++++++++
243 (This is just after my last entry:  To be brief, we continued on and neared the Nor-gate in the mountains.  Narfaal
244 and Hargo set up Vesta-cannons to suprise the incoming group.)
245 Riding slowly along the steep trail winding up to the gate, the party gained it's first glimpse of the massive 
246 stucture.  It was ebony black, with small silver specks being the only mark upon it's face.  A faint glow could be seen
247 near the edges of the door.  "The time is quite close no-", Milchar began.
248 WHHHOOOOOOMMMM! A blast of violent amber energy smote the ground near Milchar, knocking him off Drinny and sending the
249 others scattering.  "Take cover!", the Friar yelled, crouching behind a rock, peering toward the source of the fire.
250 Mounted on a high outcropping of rock some 150 feet overhead, was a short green barrel with a sight mounted on it.  
251 The barrel was smouldering, and a short man giggled with delight at the Chaos he had caused.  "Hargo like death, death
252 fun!  Like to see others suffer!  Me be just like Narfaal!", the man rasped.
253 Suddenly, the barrel spat out several more beams...  one of these beams hit another outcropping of rock, sending 
254 boulders down upon the party- Milchar barely had enough time to release his Soul-self before his body lost 
255 consciousness.  #Hurry, enter the gate!  It opens even now!#, Milchar's soul-self thought out to the others.  #He will
256 believe me dead, and report to his master!  Hurry!#

270 To: Mikey. Re: Updates of BWMS & KAMAS.
271 Have you given KAMAS a thought as a substitute for good ol' BWMS?  I am running
272 an RKAMAS at 283-xxxx (ATE-BYTE) and could easily switch the topics around so 
273 as to have a 376 K byte fiction topic (even two of them) and leave the rest of
274 the space for other topics.  The system is running at 1200/300 bps and is using
275 678 K of ram disk and 752 K of floppies so there is a lot of storage.  Also,
276 I can put the content of topics into ASCII files on most 5.25" formats which
277 is something many people seem to want.
278 Are you enjoing KAMAS?  Have you used it any?  Let me know if any of the ideas
279 above apeal to you.

289   The Green Plagues were still raging, but a cure was being distributed to the diestricts not too far gone to help.

291   She didn't have the power to send for help. Nor could she reform which would cure her. She was doomed.

302 Morning had come rather early, dawning bright and clear.  I got evryone up, except Milchar, who had
303 apparently not gone to sleep at all.  I brought out the cloth and unfolded it for breakfast.  After
304 grace (It is my cloth, after all),we all ate well, for I feared a strenuous day.  Getting going on
305 our journey, we looked an amazing sight.
306 After a short ride, we saw it.  The site was amazing.  As I contemplated it, the ground exploded 
307 around us.  "Take cover !", I yelled.  Milchar was hit, and he crumpled to the ground.  "Milchar !"
308 My voice was almost drowned out by more energy bursts.  I heard Milchar's voice urging us through
309 the norgate.  We would be safe there.  I told Scout to dissolve back to the corral, which he most
310 gratefully did.  I grabbed the inert body of Milchar and ran for the gate, leaping through it to
311 the assumed sanctuary beyond.  Suddenly I was no longer in existence.  Or at least my body no longer
312 responded to sensual stimulae.  I felt the psychic presence of Milchar next to me, and thought
313 "What is this ?" Milchar's voice came to me "Do not fear, my friend, we will be out of the void in
314 a moment".

319 Laissez-faire - Have you left BWMS for awhile or are you just in 'lurkin'
320     mode for a bit? You asked who was going to watch the debates. I did
321     indeed watch both television candidate photo opportunities. One could
322     hardly call them debates. Conclusion: of the four perhaps we should
323     elect Ferraro and Bush, then let them flip a coin to see who gets to be
324     president!	(Best two out of three tosses... 3 out of five?)
325 
326 DAWN - I couldn't help but notice the general tonality of your messages. It
327     has something of a familiar ring to it. Perhaps you might try making a
328     contribution of your own rather than just offering criticism of the
329     entries of others. I do agree that the future is in the hands of the
330     youth of today, as it always has been in any era. How about giving us a
331     demonstration of this potential in the form of written expression here.
332     Debate, stories, or take your pick. Backwater has always been dealer's
333     choice. People, young or old, willing to contribute, have always been
334     given room to express themselves. Even those who only criticize others.

337     "Would you please teach us how to bring order out of chaos?"
338     "I look around me and I see no chaos. Perhaps you should
339      ask to be taught how to see."

342     usual because I lacked the time to make it short."

384 The Friar was carrying Milchar's body through the void, struggling through the gate...
385 #...help, Milchar..#   A weak thought had found its way through the countless planes of existance, drawn to the center.
386 A soul entered Milchar's soul-self, and Milchar gave it some of his limited strength.  #I am the Former...Where am I
387  ow?#  #In the Nor-Gate, we shall be through in but a moment.  If I hadn't been crossing through at the moment I would
388  ever have heard your plea.  A plague?#
389  Yes, the Green Plagu..#   At that moment, the straggling members of the group broke through the membrane.
390  he group found itself standing at the north end of a narrow valley, obviously the northernmost reach of the Ruby 
391  alley.  It was quite narrow and rocky at this end, probably due to the influence of the extra-planar connection.  What
392  veryone could see, they marveled at... then they saw something even more amazing.
393   body was laying in a shallow pool of azure water.  The body was covered with a sort of green slime- not at all 
394  leasing to look at.  As the party watched in morbid fasination, the water cleansed the slime from the body, and a 
395  ealthy glow began to radiate from it.  Milchar's body was exhibiting the same moist look, and the same glow.  Small
396  uts and bruises on the members of the group vanished as the mysterious water touched them.  Suddenly, the Former and
397  ilchar got up, laughing quietly.  "Ahh,", Milchar said, "I have not felt this good in a very long time.  Former, I 
398  elcome you to our expedition.  I wish there were time for formal introductions, but I fear that 'Hargo' will come in 
399  fter us.  Let us go in to the main section of the Valley and plan our defense."
400  he Friar, a little shaken by Milchar's formerly unconscious body spewing out this dialogue, asked, "Who is Hargo?  Why
401  id he attack?  What have we done?"
402  Nothing, my good friend.  I believe in this case it is not what we have done, but what we can or will do.  But let us
403  o.  Sunset here will be in another hour, and I would like to be in the Gazebo at that time."
404  Why?", the Former asked.
405  To witness the greatest map-maker of all, of course."
406 "Huh?", the Former said, obviously having a hard time dealing with his new livelihood.
407 "You shall see, and know that fate must have had a hand in your resurrection."
408 A green blast of force from the direction of the gate convinced all to move closer to the center...
409 While moving, Milchar thought about the strange water and wondered why he had not noticed any of that before...

442 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
443    The piper had wandered away from the main party.  As he flew, seated on the
444 back of the pegasus, he felt the cool breeze of morning chilling away the warmth
445 of the morning sunbeams.  His mount's mightly wings were braced in the air, 
446 scarcely moving, sensitive to every nuance and fluctuation of the air currents.
447    From his seat,  the party looked almost like heavily laden ants struggling 
448 along the threadlike pathway that wound into the deepening canyons of the 
449 looming mountains.  The earth looked broken and tourtured here..  What incredible
450 forces had lifted and broken these huge slabs of stone?  Had some giant child
451 overturned and broken some gigantic toy in an incredible fit of rage?  
452   The piper's mind, lulled by the slow glide and morning sun, drifted idly over
453 these and other subjects, as he watched the party's slow crawl far below.
454   He considered, briefly, landing to confer with Milchar -- but no, they were
455 getting close to their destination, as Milchar had described it.  He leaned 
456 forward to bury his face in the sweet-smelling mane of his steed, feeling 
457 delight in moving, breathing, and just being alive in this of all worlds.
458   The first indication he had of trouble was the tensing of the pegasus' muscles
459 under the silken hide.  Mind still drifting, the piper responded by hooking his
460 knees over the leading edge of the mighty wings, just in time to prevent 
461 being thrown off by the abrupt wheel of his steed.  Banking almost vertically,
462 the pegasus seemed to pivot upon one straining wing as the backwash from 
463 unleashed energy limned her rider and herself with shimmering green outlines.
464   The piper did not see the energy release, and being unharmed by the frightening,
465 but essentially harmeless energy backwash, he was unprepared for Milchar's 
466 mental message.  "Milchar -- hurt!" sped through his mind.  Gaining control
467 with some difficulty, he managed to turn the pegasus around toward the site of
468 the recent disaster.  Drifting in eerie silence, they swiftly but cautiously
469 slid over the intervening ridge toward the rough valley where the party had
470 been ambushed.  Using silence and altitude, the strange dancing figure manning
471 a strange weapon below them was unaware of the approach of Peg and her rider.
472 (OK-- I never claimed to be very original at naming animals!)
473 The weapon (for that was all it could be) was a strange combination of strength
474 and fragility.  The barrel, of pitted green metal, obviously withstood 
475 tremendious energies, but attached to it was a strange crystalling object that
476 seemed to be neither here nor there.  The grotesquely capering figure seemed to
477 be alone, although how he could have piled the boulders into a rough breastwork
478 the piper could not imagine.  He had leaped atop the piled stone breastwork now,
479 waving his fists above his head in unholy glee.  The piper, holding tightly
480 to his steed was scarcely twenty feet away when he yelled loudly, "Hey, Ugly,
481 That wasn't a Nice ThinG To DO!"  The being's face was a study in amazement
482 as he turned to be confronted with a rider on a horse with a 20-footh wingspan.
483 The amazement on that face turned to horror a split-second before a forward
484 snap of the pegasus' right wing smashed the ugly face of the ambusher into
485  lying bits of red and white horror.  The leading edge of the first joint of
486   pegasus' wing is capable of breaking through an 8-inch green tree -- the
487  mbusher's skull furnished much less resistance.
488   Stooping swiftly into the valley, the piper saw the last of the party enter
489 the open gateway.  Landing before it, he hesitated, then with determination
490 began leading Peg to the door.  He folded the great white wings more closely
491 to her body, brushing bits of gore from the right wing, and stroking her neck
492 and speaking softly, overcame her nervousness and lead her into the flickering
493 blackness.  The ways of darkness are long and tortuous.  The piper, without
494 Milchar and the party for his guide seemed to wander forever in that strange
495 domain -- flickers of energy that he could neither see nor hear washed by him.
496 He felt the rawness of unreleived pain streak through his nonexistent body, the
497 anguish of betrayal, the ecstasy of completion, the exhilarition of the epopt,
498 and the awful gripping numbness of emotional exhaustion -- then feelings for
499 which he could put no name came at him, and although his senses were totally
500 suspect, he could sense the bond between him and his steed growing stronger
501 through this test of adversity.  Her thoughts seemed to be taking more tangible
502 form ... he strained to...                                                                                             
503 Suddenly, a great green wash of energy, propelled by a fantastic force of
504 gibbering hate rushed through the darkness.  The piper turned to follow it
505 and emerged from the gateway just in time to see the party scatter.
506 "I'd better get out of the line of fire" he thought quickly, and moving to the
507 side mounted and urged Peg into the sky.

555 PASDOS is a utility program written in Pascal and assembly for the Apple II
556        computer to allow transfers of files between Dos 3.3 and U.C.S.D
557        Pascal. 
558        Pasdos will run under both the old and new versions of Apple Pascal.
559        
560        Using this program one is able to
561        
562        1..View a Pascal directory or a Dos 3.3 catalog.
563           A single keystroke command determines and displays
564           the proper directory (Pascal or Dos) from the drive
565           selected.
566        
567        2..Transfer text files in both directions with automatic conversion.
568           Text files from Dos 3.3 are made compatible with the U.C.S.D.
569           editor and Pascal compiler. Text files generated with the
570           Pascal editor are made compatible with many word proccessors
571           that run under Dos 3.3.
572        
573        3..Transfer other files with optional addition or removal of the
574           Dos 3.3 length and starting address header.
575        
576        4..Use the U.C.S.D. Assembler to generate binary files that
577           can be 'brun' under Dos 3.3.
578        
579        5..Demonstrations are included to show you how to transfer and
580           load hires picture files, and how to use the U.C.S.D 
581           assembler to create binary programs that will run under
582           Dos 3.3.
583        
584        6..Various data base programs are written under Dos 3.3 or Pascal.
585           With Pasdos you can transfer hires graphs to your favorite
586           operating system for printer dumps etc.
587  
588 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
589  
590       Pasdos requires that you have Pascal and Dos 3.3.
591       You must have two floppy drives.
