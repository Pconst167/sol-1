35 Excuse me... A small break in the flow of the prepared text.  Why am I 
36 having problems uploading to this system?  
37 MIG - It is not the delay at end of line.  I just tried 9 ( count them,
38 nine WHOLE ) seconds as a delay, when that did not work I set it up so I 
39 was manually promting each new line by hand.  It does not seem to be at
40 the end of lines where the problem is coming in.
41 ALL - I beg your pardon and cooperation on this small space wasting 
42 discussion which is about to get me killed.

45 
     In  his previous time, Arthur had been a warrior king.  Though he
46 
had not been able to count far enough to know his age, he  knew  those
47 
years had been pleasant.  He had led the Bretons to victory over their
48 
invading  oppressors,  and  under  the  tutelage  of  Merlin created a
49 
societal structure that would live for centuries.  The mortals he  had
50 
led,  in  turn,  had  preserved his name in legend and embellished his
51 
story as they passed it down, one age to the next.  Not even he  could
52 
remember  the extent of his exploits; the specifics were gone, but the
53 
feelings remained. 
54 
    Arthur had grown up an illegitimate child of a king and was raised
55 
by a wet-nurse as her own.  He was  always  well  provided  for.   His
56 
stepfather  and  brothers had always fought in the great tourneys, and
57 
they passed this skill on to him.  Looking at  the  disjointed  tribes
58 
that  came forward to tourney, Arthur had somehow formed the idea that
59 
if these noble men could be united,  they  could  outdo  the  invading
60 
Romans  and send them out of Britain forever.  The problem lay in that
61 
there was no leader the tribes would follow;  only  a  master  of  the
62 
tourneys  they affectionately called "king".  If Uther called any save
63 
64 tourneys  they affectionately called "king".  If Uther called any save
65 
his own tribe to arms, some would follow, but the rest would take arms
66 
against him.  The resulting battle would  advance  the  cause  of  the
67 
Romans,  not the Bretons.  In the past, the tribes had banded together
68 
only long enough to quell any Roman advance,  then  celebrate  with  a
69 
feast of gluttony and debauchery.  It was during these feasts that the
70 
alliance  was  broken;  a merrymaker killed in a squabble or someone's
71 
wife raped would send the tribes back to their own territories.  Uther
72 
Pendragon had, at one time or another, raped more  than  half  of  the
73 
wives  of  tribal  leaders.   But  he held his title as long as no man
74 
defeated him in battle, and this was honored, but tourneys  were  held
75 
frequently in hopes that someone would end Uther's reign. 
76 
     Tourneys were held at the site of the sword in the stone.  It was
77 
held  that  he  who  drew  the  sword from the stone would be the true
78 
le!der of all the tribes, but the sword  had  been  so  long  reposing
79 
there that many did not believe it could be removed.  Arthur had spent
80 
hours  studying  the sword and the stone, and watched the strongest of
81 
men fail in the effort to  free  the  sword.   He  himself  had  tried
82 
several  times  to  pull  the sword out, twisting and tugging and even
83 
attempting to lever it out with his brother's spear.  His brother  was
84 
a  long time forgiving him for that antic, and Arthur spent three days
85 
making him a new shaft. 
86 
     On one of the occasions Arthur sat in the sun watching the stone,
87 
he began to remember the times he had lain in the sun  at  the  quarry
88 
with  Tom, the tinkerer's son.  He only saw Tom when the tinkerer came
89 
to town and when Tom came, they went to many  wonderful  places.   The
90 
old  quarry  was  one  of their favorites, for they could bathe in the
91 
pool of water in the man-hollowed rock, then sun themselves dry  while
92 
watching  the stonecutters.  The cutters would break large sections of
93 
rock from the bed merely by applying a chisel and striking it  with  a
94 
hammer.   As  he  envisioned  the  large  pieces  of rock breaking, he
95 
started as an idea gripped his mind.  Why not?  He raced back  to  the
96 
tent  and grabbed the hammer used to pound dents out of armor.  Hiding
97 
the hammer under his shirt (wincing at the cold), he crept out to  the
98 
clearing  where the stone rested.  Waiting at the edge of the clearing
99 
until everyone had gone to the feast, he  approached  the  stone.   He
100 
took  off  his  shirt and wrapped the pommel of the sword so as not to
101 
mar it.  He swung back and brought the hammer home.  The old stone let
102 
out an arthritic wail, as though someone was  forcing  an  old  hinge.
103 
With a loud pop, the stone split in two, and Arthur leapt back to keep
104 
his  toes from being crushed by the falling pieces.  When the old rock
105 
was again at rest, he rushed forward and picked up  the  heavy  sword.
106 
As  he  unwrapped the shirt he began to think.  Had he done a terrible
107 
wrong?  He could not fix the stone, just as he and Tom could  not  fix
108 
his  brother's  spear.   Nor  could  he  thrust the sword into another
109 
stone, this he was sure of.  How  could  the  ultimate  ruler  of  the
110 
Bretons  be  found  without  the  test of the sword?  He stared at the
111 
sword in disbelief, not noticing the approach of a wizened old man  in
112 
a deep cobalt robe.

128 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (warning not needed, it was far too late)
129      As  I followed Awullsu from the wooded grove we soon found ourselves to
130 be joined by another.  We stopped for a moment as was the custom to introduce
131 all men on first meetings, I turned to meet the our newcomer.
132      "Wipunxit, ho!  Ha Nagatamen... a nutiket," she said for me.
133 He seemed puzzled for the slightest moment, then recognition was in his eyes.
134      "Nagatamen?  Ho!  I am Wipunxit, friend to Meteu.  Welcome back to the
135 village of mankind."  The words were dificult for him in my tounge, but he 
136 spoke them well.  I was impressed.
137      "And I am...  the Guardian," I stammered as I gave him my outstreched hand
138 as a sign of mutual trust.  We joined hands at the wrist and shook in peace.
139 As our hands released, he went back to the task of leading us into the camp to
140 meet the one that was in want to see me, the medicine man, Meteu.
141      Although young for the responsibilty required of him as medicine man for
142 all his people, Meteu did not fail in keeping the spirit of mankind in good
143 repair.  It was his job, as well as their leader's, to make sure that there
144 would be no resentment held between members of the village.  Some times made 
145 for ill rest as Meteu and the elders would seek a remedy for these harsh 
146 feelings.  Not an easy job, mending and patching the morale of so many.  Why
147 was it so hard for us white men to understand that a medicine man for these
148 people needed to be more than a dealer of herbs and roots?  The contrast of
149 the two seperate civilizations could almost be likened to dusk and dawn.
150      As we entered the village, Wipunxit was accosted by another and was 
151 informed that Meteu and Sakima Had both left to speak with the elders of yet
152 another village.  These words were passed on to me by Awullsu as she spoke in
153 quiet, respectful words over the back of my shoulder.  So mach is there in this
154 language that I still must learn!

167 
168 <CONT>  So much is there in this language that I stil must learn!
169      Once Wipunxit's conversation was at an end, he turned to inform me of what
170 I had already been told.  To be polite I acted as if he were the one that was
171 telling me this for the first time, he obviously did not overhear Awullsu.
172      One thing he did tell me that Awullsu did not was that there were some
173 other strangers seen near the village and asked if I would accompany him in 
174 seeing who they might be.  It was a compliment that he assumed I knew who all
175 of the local innhabitants were, I did not but I was finding out more and more
176 with each passing day- things I did not want to know butkept to myself anyway.

256   before the show starts and after the movie has completed- as in the inter-

258   standing up on the ledge, but don't be suprised... I'm just making sure that
259   the twits aren't throwing their food at each other...

265 
266 ==========================================================================
267      A solitary figure stalks the dark streets of the city. He avoids the
268 streetlights, hugging to the corners of buildings and bushes that
269 offer cover. The plaza he seeks is now in sight. A high-rise building of
270 modern construction, it looms above him like a silent guardian. It houses
271 the man's prey; the one he searches for.
272 
273     The instructions from his employers are perfect. He traverses security
274 device after security device with little trouble. Infrared sensors, sound
275 activated alarms, movement sensors, laser-light door guards, all fall before
276 his expert tools, and his prior knowledge of the layout. Never before 
277 had he had such a complete casing of a location. He knows exactly where
278 everything is, how it works, and how to disable it. A person with lesser
279 skills would have been cut to ribbons long ago. His prey is certainly
280 well protected.
281 
282     The strange elevator is the last hurdle to overcome. Up or down? Which
283 way is he moving? It doesn't matter, for the doors soon open, and he is
284 moments away from his destination. The outer office is dark, but he sees the
285 thin line of light that marks the door he must open. Behind that door, a
286 man is sitting, working late. His diligence may prove his downfall. The
287 man readies himself, and his weapon, the last, but most productive tool of
288 his trade. He approaches the door, and slowly, silently, his hand grips the
289 door, and he turns the handle.
290 
291      The man has his back turned. He is facing a terminal behind his desk.
292 The glow of the phosphor screen light up the area around him like some
293 perverse camp fire. The light comes and goes as the screen fills and clears.
294 The man behind the desk is so engrossed with what he sees on the screen, he
295 doesn't sense the new presence in the room. The intruder announces himself
296 with the click of his silencer making its last twist into place. The man
297 whirls, and greets his unwelcome guest. 
298  
299      "What can I do for you?", the sitting man says.
300 
301      "You can't do anything for me. But I have come to do something to you.
302 You are going on a little trip. You are about to meet your maker." The man
303 with the gun is grime and determined in his speech. "Welcome to Hell, Ian!"
304 His finger tightens on the trigger...

337 Ah, at last, THOR could see a chair vacant in a corner. He walked quickly
338 to it and sat his extra large frame down and sighed a breath of relief. It
339 had been a long time coming and THOR had been standing on the wayside hopin
340 g for a chair to materialize. Forced to stand and so unable to even scratch
341 a message to the INN KEEPER, THOR had to wait his turn and did so impatiently.
342 So much was taking place at the INN and THOR had certainly missed most. But 
343 what he did see sufficed him and made him feel the wait had been worth the
344 effort. THOR motioned to the INN keeper for a pewter mug of ale and as he
345 did he noticed that one called the GUARDIAN was still at the INN. The INN
346 keeper caught THOR's prompt and before leaving for the bar saw that THOR 
347 also ordering for the GUARDIAN who was hard at work with paper and pen.
348 THOR did not see many that he knew but it did not matter for the INN keeper
349 was always a good judge of character and allowed only those who were reputable
350 and honest to enter and to drink at the INN. There were a couple of patrons who had shown a long 
351 winded trait in their discussions and stories but they had been interesting
352 and somewhat original. THOR was happy just to have his much awaited chair and
353 was forlorn only that he did not see a patron who he enjoyed most. Too bad, 
354 thought THOR to himself, perhaps I did not get here early enough. Well I will rest and hope that the 
355 morrow brings me better luck and maybe even a glimpse of kathyd will be
356 fulfilling.

360         As the figure before him crumpled to the floor, the intruder

371   It didnot take long to recover from the transition back to the "center".
372 I walked slowly along the walls, deciding which door would be next. What
373 was i searching for?  What was my desire? "DEIRE", yes that was to be it.
374 I scrambled back to the machine to get my escape, which i quickly dropped
375 into my pants pocket. As i touched "DESIRE'S" door, it burst open at the
376 lightest tap, and i entered.  I was in a vast desert, with the wind whipping
377 about and sand everywhere, and when i say everywhere i mean everywhere.
378 I was driving a Hagen Daas truck and I wanted very badly to sample the cool
379 wet goods that had been intrusted to me. But time was short, i could only
380 drive, with no time to stop. The hours drug on, the sand, the wind, the
381 ice cream. My mind was in a frezy, i couldn't stand it another moment, I\
382 quickly braked and brought the truck to a halt. I jumped out into the 
383 sandstorm groping my way along the side of the truck, i had reached the\
384 back, the handle to the door was in my hand, I pulled back on the handle
385 and felt the rush of cold air hit my wrist and arm. I had gone mad, my
386 trembling hand reached for the cool container, just as my fingers touched
387 the sweaty cylinder a voice was hear. A voice? hey this is my "DESIRE".
388 I turned to see a turban topped man, with a very big menacing knife.
389   "How much " the man inquires?
390   My jaw drops to my knees as i ask what variety he is interrested in.
391 He ordered a double scoop choclate choclate chip cone, pays me and
392 makes like a banana and splits. I glance down at my TIMEX to see that
393 it has stopped. "DESIRE" again grows within me, but i am able to
394 contain myself and get back in the cab of the truck. before i start
395 the engine, i pause.. I know now of "DESIRE" that i am weak, Ive decided
396 that I prefer the rain and pull escape out of my pocket.

399   As the pegasus negotiated the cloud valley, the illusion slowly became weaker
400 as the cloud valley floor thinned, allowing brief glimpses of the moonlit
401 earth far below.  Moved by a peverse whim, the piper brought the wind-cooled
402 blowpipe of his pipes to his lips, and settling the pipes more firmly under
403 his arm inflated them.
404   Now the piper was not a particularly wise man; if, by wise, you mean one who
405 takes due regard for the consequence of his actions. (blast! enter only!)  He 
406 had a distressing tendency to act on impulse, to leap wild improbabilities and
407 vault to nearly untenable conclusions.  As his fingers danced over the chanter,
408 the weird whining music of the pipes seemed to grasp the thinning cloud valley
409 and thicken and curdle the very air.  First, the patchy nature of the valley
410 floor was repaired, the air thickening and adding detail to the scene.  Next,
411 the broad reaches of the encroaching foothills took on definition and character.
412   Far beyond, the ramparts of the enclosing mountain ranges humped themselves
413 up to pierce the encircling sky.  
414   As the piper's tune wound on, an outside observer would have been hard pressed
415 to determine whether the landscape about him took on definition, or whether the
416 piper's outline took on some of the ghostly insubstantiality of the encircling
417 clouds.  Indeed, there is, perhaps, little to choose between them.  For what
418 we call "solid" matter is perhaps better described as a slightly impure vacuum.
419 These transformations are much less amazing if we remember that it is merely
420 slight rearrangement of probability clouds in a limited area.
421    As the densities of probabilities waxed and waned in proximity to the piper,
422 the illusion of galloping along a country road grew stronger.  Fingers and
423 tendrils of mist took on more and more the character of trees and bushes.
424 Faintly, but distinctly, the sound of the pegasus' hooves could be heard beating
425 time to the piper's song from the ghostly pavement, beating an accompnement to
426 his wailing song.  No longer did the pegasus' wings cut noislessly through the
427 concentrations of mist, now the rustle of disturbed leaves reached her ears,
428 and woke her rider to the realization that somehow they had arrived -- 
429 somewhere under a silver-fire moon.

435 Many of you may have tryed to get on to BWMS Monday night, and Tuesday
436 morning, and only encountered a busy signal that even an autodialer
437 coudn't get thru. No, BW didn't become massively popular all of the
438 sudden (at least no more so then normal). It seems we have been having
439 just a bit of trouble with the phone system. Causing the busy signal,
440 and dropping people off when they did get thru. It seems to have stablized
441 out a bit, so maybe they've got the problem taken care of. I hope so.

443 I ASSUMED THAT GUARDIAN IS A CO-OWNER THEN.
444  
445 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     ("I am *NOT* !!!")
446 I admit that I do show some arogance when my writing is concerned, but I have
447 not as of yet had met with THE owner and operator of this system, known to you
448 as CISTOP MIKEY.  I also admit that the usage of more than one "name" here may
449 be an act of selishness, I'll have to try and tone down my (over)use here.
450 
451 Toning down mat eventually mean that I might have to force myself away from the
452 Inn- something I shall never look forward to.  Prehaps what I'm looking for
453 from my writing is a little pat on the back or an "I wish I thought of that.."
454 It may seem obvious to some that my words are too much controled by my emotion.
455 Maybe I should apply myself in other directions, other fields that this 
456 "fiction trash", as a less informed friend puts it.
457 
458 Don't think that *I* consider this a waste of time, I find it very, very 
459 intersesting to see just what is on other people's minds.  Too simple, eh?
460 
461 Well, here I go again.  I let myself get carried away.  I should have just let
462 it slide right on by, ignore it.  On to business...
463  
464 Piper:  A fine cheer to you.  Words that paint such a montage could not have
465   come from anyone finer...
466 MiG:    I was right, the intended didn't read it. Yet.
467 I don't know...

471     I am an actor on the stage. There are many actors in the audiance. Their
472 reactions to me often hurt my feelings. I pause in my solioquy. I want to
473 cry. But, no, I am an actor. I muct hide my feelings. I must follow my script.
474 I resume my speech, acting in character.
475     I am wearing a costume. It is my protective armor. But, even so, the blades
476 that hit the armor hurt me. Although they cut no wound, they leave bruises. 
477     I have made myself an actor. But, that was only a reaction to the people of
478 the theatre. I can not leave the theatre, many times I wish to. But, I can not.
479 For, I am human, dependent on humans. I act. 
480     It is an unpleasant thought, the pain I would receive from the audiance if
481 I were to step out of character, removing my costume. But, even more unpleasant
482 is when I am not on stage, I am in the audiance.    -Tanya

484  At last the daimyo's fortress stood before him, dark against the night sky.  The moon shone brightly
485  behind it.  Carefully he proceeded forward, alert for any sound, sight, or sign that would 
486 betray the presence of a watchful gaurd.  Arriving at last at the base of the outer wall, ha began
487  to remove the rope from his pack.  Suddenly he froze, intennt on listening.  The sound 
488 of several feet approaching came from the top of the wall, on the right.  Quickly, he pressed into
489  the shadows of the wall, willing his breathing to become slow and shallow - an art that had 
490 been practiced in his family for generations.  The footsteps continued, and then stopped 
491 as they came directly over his hiding place.  Willing his
492 breathing to stop, he closed his eyes and focused his senses on the patrol on the wall.
493 There were five - no, six of them, and there were no signs that they suspected an intruder as yet.
494 Silently he waited:  twenty...twenty-five...thirty heartbeats.
495 Thirty-seven, and the footsteps began again, fading away to his left.  Working quickly, he
496 pulled the rope from
497 his pack and laid the coils on the ground.  Scanning carefully for observers one more time, he ob-
498 tained a good hold on the grappling hook and threw it over the wall.  Pulling the rope till the hook
499 was secure, he began his ascent of the wall, and reached the top a few seconds later, with no further
500 interuptions from any guards.  Quickly he released the hook,lowering the rope to the ground with 
501 a black thread, which he deftly secured in a crack in the stone wall, and dropped on the inside of
502 the wall.  He was now is the shadows of the inner courtyard.

513 "Innkeeper, Scotch Whiskey and Water, If
514 you please!"
515 I could tell from the Innkeeper's suspicious glances at me that he didn't
516 quite know what to make of this newcomer to the Inn.
517 "I see by the other folks in the room, that this is the haunt of learned
518 folk, is that correct, Sir?", I queried cautiously.  The Innkeeper only
519 responded with a non-committal: "One can see many types of personalities if one
520 has the eyes with which to see."
521     With that the Innkeeper gave me the Scotch, I payed him, and took my bags
522 and drink to a table next to the hearth.
523 Seated at this table was a man dressed in grey robes.  He was leaning back in hi
524 s chair, propped against the warm stones of the fireplace.  I couldn't make out
525 his face, but I could see his eyes, like shining black coals.  They brought a
526 chill to my bones.  "Howdy-do, Sir!", I greeted with all of the aplomb I could
527 muster and offered my hand.  The robed one remained still and offered no answer 
528 to my greeting, but the black coals grew more intense.  "You talk alot, don't yo
529 u?", I continued, somewhat ill advisedly.  But only silence did I recieve from
530 this denizen of the Inn.  I smiled weakly, waved my hand to him in farewell, and
531 sought another table.  Unfortunately, there was no otherr table to be had, s I
532 went back to the bar and sat at it, with
533 the Innkeeper for company.
534     The Innkeeper said, "He won't talk to anyone he doesn't know, stranger.
535 What did you say your name was?"  "I didn't say what my name was, but 'tis not
536 a secret:  Smith, John Smith", I replied, knowing that I was in for another
537 ribbing.  But the Innkeeper continued, "What brings you to the Inn, Mr. Smith?"
538 It was always hard to explain my "ocupation" but somehow, I felt very uneasy
539 about letting on about myself in this place.  The walls seemed to have ears.
540 "I'm in sales", I lied.  The Innkeeper's eyes lit up for an instant, and then hi
541 s eyes narrowed.  "What kind of sales?"  "Precious goods, the stuff of dreams.",
542 I hoped in vain that my story would turn him off the track I knew he would 
543 persue.  How could I have been so foolish?  But, in my business, mistakes are pa
544 rt of the game.

552  Well, I am trying to get a list of all of the names that are on this

556 It would be neat to get a hold of some archives and see the people that once
557 called and were patrons of the Inn.  I just wonder how many people call,
558 leave some mail or a story then leave compared to the people who call, read

602 THORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORThe INN was fabulous tonight 
603 THOR thought to himself. Yes even some new comers had given of their talent
604 and it had been pleasing to THOR. There was a new comer who was extremely 
605 verbose in his nature but THOR chalked up the newcomers loquaciousness to
606 the jitters of being a stranger in an unfamiliar place. THOR had not wanted 
607 to seem unfriendly towards the man but it had been obvious from his actions 
608 that he would have chattered on about anything and everything if an ear had 
609 been captured. THOR was not one to converse idly with those he knew for a 
610 lifetime and the poor stranger had not a snowballs chance on first 
611 encountering him and attempting to strike up a frivolous exchange.
612 I will watch this man Mr. Smith, THOR thought to himself and from my inner
613 instincts I feel he will become a regular here at the INN. THOR did not want
614 to give up his seat but time marched by too quickly and he knew that he
615 must make a stop at the city of TANIS in hopes of seeing more of the talents
616 from the INN there. Maybe tomorrow, THOR thought, yes tomorrow.
