21 Ahhh, a religious discusion is at hand.  I am a freethinker, an atheist.
22 How could you believe someof the things in the bible.  You must say that
23 some of the books are $great$ stories but are they anything other than a
24 best seller?  There might be some truth, a little truth in the bible but
25 it's all based on *BELIEVE ME* kind of attitude.  In the bible it sais
26 'don't rest untill you have built a temple for GOD' thats good, real cute.
27 What are you going to do if you yourself don't have a house.  A place to 
28 stay.  You can't sleep in the chuch can you.  People bow and lower them-
29 selves to a mythical being.  Was he really there? Did he really do what
30 the $good book$ said he did?  People praise him, and hold him high.  But
31 at the first sign of pain or agony who else can you blame but god.  I
32 haven't seen many people blame themselves for what they did wrong.  Religeon
33 is a rich man/ladies toy.  The poor can't afford it and that's wrong.
34 And that idea about a universal church?  Nice try but no cigar.  That's
35 just as bad as saying everyone had to wear the same clothes and ac in
36 the same manner.  Sure there would be no wars, trouble or crime.  Where
37 would the happiness be too?  It wouldn't be with the for they are all the
38 same, why should one of them be different.
39 I'm fuzzy about this 'GOOD' 'BAD' thing.  Who can explain any of it?
40 use your head, think for your self and be YOUSELF not what some person
41 said you should be.  I'm not saying everyone should burn their Bibles
42 but if thats what you want to do fine.  If you want to continue as a
43 religious, child of god, more power to you!  This is just what I think
44 and if it contributes to what is being said thatsok.  If not...  
45 And about the guys around the table, I belive they were writting what they
46 felt was the right thing.  I just don't agree with it, sorry but thats
47 what I beleive.

49 MiG: I think what happened a long time ago should be held as just that.
50      grizzly is "out of touch" with what has been going on.  I totally
51     dissagree with what he typed in.  I though all that was already
52      cleared up a long time ago?  I dred the day he gets his own modem,
53      he will stir up what ever he can and he won't even know what he is doing.
54      To him that is normal, demented, but normal.  Do what I do all the
55      time, don't pay any ettention to him at all.

59 Hi All,
60 Speaking of religion, how about just be nice to everybody?
61 Isn't that basically the Christian belief?  (Excluding that Billy Gram
62 stuff.)  I can see the evolution theory working, but what about the first
63 life?  I think the universe needed a little shove from someone above.
64 Ditto with the formation of matter from energy into its complex form.
65 I can handle this.  So, just be basically nice to everybody, and hope
66 they'll be nice back.
67 About good and evil, good is just being nice and working with
68 other people.  Evil is basically out for itself.  Keep in mind, that
69 neither one can compete without some of the other.
70 Is the universe just a giant computer?  (Please don't make
71 references to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I know it sounds
72 similar.)  Is someone running a big program?  Don't you feel like God
73 when you program?  Ponder my words.....

103    My goodness!  I've been trashed!  I entered quite an involved message
104 on the other drive yesterday (while it was still drive A) and now see
105 that it has been overwritten by the start of a religious tirade or series
106 of them.  In summary, I proposed an initiative campaign to place 
107 "none of tehe above" as a required choice whenever an election is being
108 held to fill an office.  Not only would this give the disillusioned, such
109 as myself, and perhaps mikey, and surely many more, a method of establishing
110 our dissatisfation, it would give a means of eliminating the dissatisfaction
111 if enough people are upset by the lack of a "choice."  For you folks who
112 have hyet to participate, it's a way to get in some good, clean, healthy
113 fun -- standing around supermarket parking lots, bus stops, and downtown
114 street corners buttonholing citizens and asking for their signature on
115 the petition.   At any rate, the idea seems to have bothered someone to
116 the extent that they felt compelled to erase it.  It will be interesting
117 to see if that happens again!

121 WOW!!!  Multiple discussions.
122 
123 Religion - I don't buy atheism.  It is not logical, in that no one can 
124            know everything, and thus can't say there is no god.  I
125            will accept agnosticism, as I am one.  (Desitic perhaps,
126            but still agnostic.)  To believe in no god is as much an act
127            of faith as believing in a particular god.  Faith would
128            seem to be a distasteful concept to atheists, but it is 
129            easily shown that it is not.
130 
131 Noneoftheabove - Could someone win the election by plurality, or is
132                  an absolute majority mandated?  It seems like an
133                  interesting concept.
134 
135 Reagan - Yes, Mikey, I will vote for Reagan.  I think he is doing OK,
136          and I feel that Nuclear War is so unthinkable that even he 
137          won't pull the trigger.
138

144 MiG: he plans on getting his own modem in the near future.  He has
145      been waiting for one for a long time now so he might pop up at
146      any time.  You'll see me disapear when he does arrive because I
147      don't want to see what kind of stuff he'll enter in.

187 First, about all of this religion stuff,
188 it must be understood that I, and
189 I alone, know all the answers to 
190 the questions posed because, if
191 you haven't guessed already, I
192 am God.  And, if you were wonder-

194 it is the heavenly computer.  But,
195 back to the ranch.  Yes, there
196 is a God.  And he thinks that 
197 Ronald Reagan is ugly.

203 Laissez-faire: Yes, I can use lower case, I just am lazy at times, and
204 leave it in upper case from when I turn the terminal on.
205 As far as nuclear war being unthinkable, the things Hitler did were 
206 unthinkable too, but they happened anyway.
207 By the way, I'm sure you'll be happy to know that currently Reagan
208 has 452 electoral votes compared to Mondales 86. Based on current poles.
209 
210 Here's an interesting note, It seems that the way to get your chemical 
211 waste dump onto the superfund (so uncle sam will help to pay to clean it 
212 up) is to get sited by the EPA. The way to get sited by the EPA is to
213 be bad enough to be noticable. Thus the government is indirectly 
214 encouraging industry to generate hazardous waste dumps.
215 Nice huh?

232 The religious discussion leans toward the agnostic; Kind of walks all
233 around it and stands next to it without actually adopting it because
234 committing, even to the non-committal, is so corny and earnest and uncool.
235 Laissez-Faire dares to admit to agnosticism (but throws in the equivocating
236 "Deistic").  Now that we are spared L-F's political opinions, I am horrified
237 to find that I agree with him on something--that atheism is "not logical";
238 that it is "an act of faith".  I, however, find these qualities appealing.
239 Logic, of course, serves skeptics and Jesuits equally and is not, in itself,
240 a justification for doubt. Or faith.  It seems that if you are in a state
241 of doubt (or faith) no amount of logic will make it go away.  Religion (not
242 to be confused with the church) requires a capacity other than logic, a
243 capacity akin to the one for sensuality, often underdeveloped in intellectuals
244 and technophiles.  There are scores of stories of hedonistic rakes who are
245 converted to asceticism.  Besides famous ones like St. Francis or Thomas
246 Merton, there's Little Richard.  Little Richard with the big dark eyes and
247 gravity-defying pompadour, the one who sang "Good Golly Miss Molly."  He now
248 travels the black evangelist circuit and is as wholly devoted to the church
249 as he previously was to having a howling good time.  On the other hand, there's
250 George Bernard Shaw who rejected his Irish upbringing and became a freethinker
251 ("Don't do unto others as you would they should do unto you.  They might not
252 have the same tastes.") Celibate, and utterly devoid of sensuality (he was said
253 to be "the only man to cut a swathe through the theatre leaving it strewn with
254 virgins.") With any luck, you people can be clever without Shaw's joylessness.
255 With any luck, some strong definite FEELING or IDEA like those you've been
256 watching all those other suckers experience will walk right in and take over,
257 no explanation needed.

279 I THINK I'LL LOOK FOR ANOTHER BOARD.
280 
281 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
282 Laz - How can you say that the nukes won't fly just because you find
283 it unthinkable? All you have to do is look through history to see
284 that the unthinkable tends to be rather common place. Man is quite
285 noted for the atrocities he likes to perform. It is far to easy to
286 come up with a reason for hitting that button. Particularly when
287 the person involved has a tendancy to shoot first and ask later as
288 our dear president currently.
289 Getting destroyed yourself has nothing or very little to do with hitting
290 that button. If the person believes that all is lost anyway, what
291 have they to lose? This does not mean thinking of the country as a
292 whole, but rather as a private personal decision. What would happen
293 if the presures of world disunity raised to the point that it was 
294 unbarable by some leader who has the option available? It would be
295 oh so easy to hit that button and take some of the basterds with him.
296 Or worse, try to use it to legislate peace. (If you don't do as I say,
297 I'm going to bomb you into non-existance, and just to prove I'm crazy
298 enough to do it, take that!) 
299 It has happened before, and it certainly can happen again.
300 --------------------------------------------------------------------
301 ^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^$^
302 (Laz? Rather cute, and I sort of like it.)
303 I say that nuclear war is unthinkable and therefore cannot happen in
304 a rather ostrich sort of way.  If it were to happen, I wouldn't
305 be around to talk about being wrong anymore, so the 'I told you so
306 crowd wouldn't bother me.  It could happen, but I feel it is unlikely.
307 I am not sure that the actual button pushers could do the job, for one.
308 Has anyone read the book, Level-7 ?
309 
310 Who is curious as to my beliefs.  To them I reply (In the manner of a 
311 true rhetorician in the old sense) "Everything I say is a Lie."
312 
313 Genocide on a limited basis, say against all Jews as in WWII, or against
314 all whites in another book, is much more reasonable than against the
315 total population.  (Not, I will admit to the population subset being
316 exterminated.)  That is why the Hitler analogy does not hold true.
317 
318 I feel that we would have not dropped the Nagasaki bomb if we had known
319 more about what had happened in Hiroshima.

341 
342 L'homme,
343         Ahhhh....the market. A mysterious place where constants don't exist.
344 And variables are held supreme. Nothing appears as it *IS* ....and if it *IS* 
345 it doesn't appear........ sometimes.... 
346         Well for a discussion of the stock market ........and bond market
347 by implication ( excluding futures altogether ).  You want to start with the 
348 pros and cons...OK. 
349 PROS- You are investing in the private sector thereby supporting business 
350 efforts. The potential for gains is greater. As a shareholder you have part
351 of the " action " and can become as involved with the company as your shares
352 allow. You can share responsibility for the companys efforts. 
353 CONS- The risks are great !. Bankruptcy, Inflation and poor management are
354 the major detractors for equity investment. Any combination of the above 
355 can spell LOSS in large capital letters. 
356         I prefer equity. Not to the total exclusion of debt ( Govt or Corp )
357 but as a matter of principal. I like to directly support their efforts not 
358 just play banker and lend.
359         The current rally.....Well one could say it was the start of the long 
360 awaited summer rally, but I feel it was instigated by a lot of short covering 
361 on the part of money managers and just got carried away. The next big move 
362 will be a result of interest rates. Now we are at kind of a Mexican standoff
363 The market wants lower rates...to encourage expansion...but not so low that
364 inflation hitches a ride as well. Then there is the BUDGET....ahem 
365 Most people agree its largess is unacceptable, but what the effects will be 
366 and when they will be felt are the most disputed factors yet !. 
367 FOREX - I use the Swiss franc as my barometer. A solid close above  43.10
368 in December would be a sure indication of dollar weakness overseas. And
369 would be reflected in interest rates here. 
370         No, never tried any computer generated simulations. I have however
371 built some visi-calc models to see the effects of interest rate changes on
372 certain companys ( ie. banks, S/L's, home manu etc. ) who are very sensitive
373 to changes. 
374         The heart warming << arresting >> war stories will half to wait.

377         Many thanks...Is this going to be fun. I spent most of last night
378 playing around with the new dialect.....what great string manipulation and 
379 very fast to boot !

402 All right, let's not forget our definitions.....atheism : apolitical
403 no theistic convictions : no political convictions. Atheism describes a 
404 vacuum, that's all. Now if you want to talk about beliefs, there is the
405 old animated meat theory--stiff out and that's it, folks. Reincarnation
406 theory--the spiritual "you" pops from one body to another, life after life,
407 ad nauseum, from the beginning to the end of each Big Bang cycle. On this
408 and many planets. Xism, Christerism, etc--the belief that there is some
409 validity to what's in the various versions of the Bible and it is generally
410 true. Judaism--belief that the old testament version is true but the new one
411 isn't. Both Xists and Jews agree that Jehovah is the god of gods and that
412 Thor, Eris, etc. have no validity. Pagan--acceptance of one form or another
413 of the Goddess image: Mother Nature, Astarte, Eris, Isis, etc. or a 
414 pantheistic outlook--all gods are equally true and have equal power.
415 Xists in the past used to torture and kill anyone who professed such
416 beliefs and would willingly do so again. If you don't believe it, go
417 ask the loonies at Pioneer Square or ask Jack Reynolds, who
418 goes around spraying "TRUST J*S*S" all over town. I will pay $100 to
419 anyone who can provide me with a photo of him and wife Sherry crunched
420 under a 1960 mainframe, a Mac Truck (yes, this is a Macintosh) or the
421 like. Don't do it yourself, though, that would be illegal.....
422 I have a hard time using this or any BB because the Macintosh and the
423 Applemodem 1200 is still unfamiliar territory. Bear with me.

428 Laz: My Hitler refference still holds, as I was using it to represent
429 that unthinkable acts do occur, not the type of acts. As far as the bomb
430 being dropped on Nagasaki/Hiroshima, the whole thing is suspect since
431 nothing was changed by it (except maybe for America's lust for revenge.)
432 The terms for surrender were not changed by it. All it did was to kill
433 thousands of civilians something that the US supposedly doesn't do.
434 The only thing good out of it that I can see (if anything from that
435 could be called good) is that it provided a real life demonstration
436 to the world of what the bomb can do to both property and people. I
437 think this more then anything else has provide the abosolute fear of 
438 the bomb. I feel it is the fear that you could become one of the 
439 horibly maimed people that they show that provides more fear then anything
440 else, that added to the oft presented aspect that death seldom comes
441 quickly unless you are lucky enough to be at ground zero.

444 Mikey, my father happens to work with nukes for a living, so I am qualified
445 in what I say on the subject. You need not be near ground zero, anywhere within 
446 200 MILES is good enough for instant death. 350 miles and your dead within a
447 day. Have a pleasent evening pondering this, I sure do.

454 Milchar was here, saw the various debates going on, and smiled.
455 "That is one theory of mine that proved true!", he exclaims to
456 himself.  A few gestures, and wave of the hand... and he is
457 gone again...

459 ***************************************************************
460 Mig: Just saying 200 miles, doesn't make it. If I remember (which
461 isn't that good, it has been quite a few years) that 200 mile
462 figure would be for a rather 'large' bomb. The typical radius
463 is more like 20 miles, not 200. Also, it is extremly variable 
464 based on conditions. The highth of detonation, the surrounding
465 teritory, the weather, the size and type of the bomb. Nor does
466 it end in nice neat bounderies; 'beyond this point you are dead'.
467 each person responds differently to the effects, and the effects
468 deminish as the distance increases, it doesn't just start or stop
469 on a boundry. 
470 ******************** CISTOP MIKEY *******************************
471 Mikey is right, it depends on a number of factors.According to the emergency management agency (the
472 erstwhile Civil Cefense Agency), a surface detonation of 25 megatons, mote than a thousand times greate
473 than "fat man", the Nagasaki bomb, would leave a crter .7 miles in diameter and cause total destruction of  l
474 specially designed structures within five or so mils. The approximate limit in which damage would occu
475 would be 22 miles.(from a high altitude blast)/Who is this "MIG"?  guy anyway?

482 Mikey:My father, whom I just showed this to, says that the figures are for
483 200 megatons and not exactly what "erstwhile" agencys are allowed to get access
484 to. I agree that the boundrys are not nearly that clear-cut, I was mearly 
485 making the point that ground zero is BIG! And don't ask for the figures, 
486 Father would not give them to me. I can see it now, everyone will call me a lier
487 because I can't post classified documents.
488 "And who is this MIG guy anyway" Who are you, anyway? I have stated my name on
489 this board a few times, most everyone knows who I am. So, in my typicaly 
490 infantile manor... BLAH! i'm not going to tell you! NA NA NA NA NA!

BREAK
495 Mig Guy-200 megatons? I don't claim to be an expert on the subject, but I wasn't aware that there were
496 
497 single bombs of that yield. Information on the estimated effects of thermonuclear bombs is not classifed.
498 Neither is information on known or probable targets.What is classified, among other things, is percent
499 yield and neutron "reflection" devices that lower the former critical mass ( of plutomium ) from about
500 6 kilograms to "a much smaller" quantity. It is posible to have a nuclear 'grenade', for example.
501 Another issue that is classified is research in finding ways to protect solid state devices from the
502 elecrtomagnetic pulse that results from the detonaton of plutonium or hydrogen bombs. Ask your dad
503 about the interesting method the military has of placing the plutonium in a device that places it out-
504 side the conventional explosive that detonates it so that it will be blown outward, aay from center in ca
505 accident. ( Before it is armed, that is, or the fou methods of detonation-remote, impact, aneroid, and proximity gh the 
506 IGS. He would be interesting to talk to, were he pemitted to do so. PS-I'm not gonna tell you who I am either. NYA NY

542        Three cheers for the practicioners of Semi-Reality
543        for theirs is the Kingdom of the imagination. 
544        To my way of thinking condemning MIG for having a 
545        "very active imagination" is the ultimate in Twittery.
546        I vote for Semi-reality; a candidate you can trust.

553 MIKEY- You never responded to another query, so I will propose a possible
554        answer.  Any candidate, including noneoftheabove, can win by a
555        plurality, but if noneoftheabove should win by an absolute majority
556        (of those voting, as always) then the other parties in the election
557        could not run again.  Would this be reasonable and consistent with
558        the original purpose of the candidacy of noneoftheabove ?
559 
560 MiG - I agree that ground zero is large, but I have the sneaking suspicion 
561       that you read Barry this week.  Do you have the EMP damage figures
562       from high altitude bursts, or was 22 miles including that type of
563       damage.
564 
565 Optimist - Probably cockroaches, they seem to have the greatest tolerance
566            for radiation of anything in the animal kingdom, as well as a 
567            high capacity to endure physical extremes of temperature and
568            pressure before even saying 'We be brown.'
569 
570 M.M. - To return to something you said earlier, if change is the nature of
571        man, is perfection impossible ?   Do you agree with R. Bach on the
572        subject of perfection ?  Just curious.
573 
574 General - I am in agreement with the U.S. Constitution about freedom of
575           speech, but I think the Baghwan and his minions are carrying
576           the concept to the point of aggravation.  Ma Prem Sheila, after
577           the court appearance of the Baghweenie said 'The (U.S.) Cons-
578           titution should be burned'.  She seems to be taking a lot for
579           granted, especially since the only reason she can say what she 
580           does is the protections afforded under the constitution for
581           everyone.  Not just her.
582           I am not usually a violent nor vindictive type, but I wonder how 
583           she would feel if a range fire erupted all around Rancho Rash-
584           neesh and all the people she has alienated said 'Let the bake.'
585           It would be gratifying to watch.

598      at Hollywood Computer Center. No go, unless we can hook up 5 inchers to
599      it.
600 P.H.: I don't care for "hollier than thou" attitudes either. BUT, I would rather
601       be that than "stupider than thou"
602 Alex: Your comments on the market are well taken. I know many people who gauge
603       the US dollar against the Frank.In fact, one person in my high school
604       fincance class made $1200 in one week buying and selling currency. It
605       was a class project to "make money", but he took it seriously. I made
606       $800 on paper, buying around 500 shares of Kiddie Inc, but alas, it was
607       only on paper. Out of room. More later... *%)*)*%)*%)@* L'homme *%*)%*
