29 Pam:
30 We exist in two worlds,
31      the inner and the outer.
32 The inner world is that of the mind and spirit.
33 The outer world is that of external reality.
34 All conflicts are between
35 the inner and outer worlds;
36 yet all we know of the outer world
37 are the impressions of its existence
38 received by the inner.
39 Are then these conflicts real-
40 or are they but the phantoms
41 of our quarrelsome minds?
42 If they are real, then how can we know this?
43 If they are illusion,how can we know this?
44 The search for truth is the search for consistency;
45 for an identity of form and content
46 in the two worlds.
47 Only that which exists in both worlds-
48 in the single outer world and in
49 all the inner worlds
50 of all people
51 can be said to partake of reality.
52 Inner truth
53 when it is that only 
54 is the truth of the spirit.
55 It can be as real as iron or fire
56 in the inner world
57 and its effects there can be
58 as definite;
59 and that it does not partake of reality
60 does not diminish it.
61 The mountain brook is not shamed
62 that it does not have the power of the vast ocean;
63 for it to be a brook
64 and fulfill a brook's destiny
65 is the full measure of value that can be given.
66 The actions we practice on the external world,
67 the world of stone or wood or flower,
68 matter little.
69 These actions may be illusion 
70 and they may not-
71 but even the reality of their effects
72 will fade away with the passage of time.

77 No need to call for transportation, The Lazy One said. He pulled something
78 from a pocket, and then waved into existence an opalescent arch. Just follow
79 the bouncing ball. Take Whisper instead of me though, the journey will be
80 Much too fatiguing for one of my sedentary habbits. With that he set the ball

92 To: LYSIAS
93 Subject: NET membership
94 The first step in gaining NET membership is to appear in person
95 at either the PorSFiS meeting, or the PC&S meeting after.
96 There your application will be reviewed by the highest ranking members
97 of the NETWORK, using a stringent and HIGHLY arbitrary rating system.
98 If you pass this, you will be admitted to the lower ranks of the NETWORK,
99 until such time as you have proven your value to the NETWORK.
100 If such an event were actually to occur, you would be re-evaluated and 
101 , if evidence indicates, be invited to join the elite of the NETWORK.
102  
103 Incentive to join: The desire to graduate from the level of 'system phreaker'
104 to the intellectually more satisfying realm of Human Being.
105 Members of the NETWORK do not indulge in such infantile behavior as
106 trying to crash bulletin boards, but are rather dedicated to the
107 tracking down and elimination of such activities.
108 Membership in the NETWORK is not open to the plebeian, but is instead
109 a privilege of those whose higher moral character cries out for
110 relief from the juvenile babblings all too prevalent on the Backwater
111 Message System.

119 Aaron: I am interested in being the fourth in the archive buy.
120        Have the 30 or so dollars in my hot little hand.
121        As I use the same DOS as L'homme, hopefully we can work out some
122        adequate method of transference.
123 Alex:  I have no problem with the 23rd for RISK.  With the exception of
124        Monday/Tuesday evenings, I am amenable to most any day/time.
125 L'homme: After our conversation, I expected to log on here and find the
126        Great American Novel (or at least the BW edition).

129   ALL ARCHIVE: well, assuming that the Ninja and Voyeur are not the one and
130 same, we have 5. I want to go for it as soon as we co-ordinate our format
131 differences.  But, if a sixth shows up, individual copy cost would be 
132 reduced to approx. $20 for the complete set.  Additional takers? Printing
133 could be arranged, probably have it laser printed.
134 
135  ALL Para-Psych: Sorry, you can't have my birthday. I was hoping something
136 more along the lines of projection, telek, etc..
137 
138  ALL: I'll type on any subject! I'm desperate! How about Eastern Mysticism?
139 
140  BARD: You were counted in that archive 5.
141 
142  L'homme: Gee, and I thought I was running for Secretary of BW Defence. Are
143 you involved with this NETWORK (ahem) game?  I fear that MF&E is moving
144 towards a simple "MF".  Checked up on my "a-lazing", eh? SOMEWHAT correct
145 you say? I'll bet I have a better "auntie a-lazing" algoritm than Mead! 
146 Seems some basic theoretical research was done in a similar area in sig.
147 proc. a few years back, hasn't been applied to graphics, though the theory
148 (as you acknoledged) is the same. Even if I don't know nothin' 'bout 
149 graphix! Nyah!     On to other topics..    seems you and the adventure
150 have come to something of a stand-still. Too bad the Doc wouldn't let you
151 borrow his dimensional stabilizer...   Might I suggest that this device..
152 maybe a computer..  maybe a very powerfull computer.. could help you out
153 of this situation itself?   If you could find a floating input, perhaps
154 you could serialize a message.... 
155 
156  PAM: yup, snides aside (gulp!), it's you!  Got your reply on BitB.

160 Bard -- I doubt that power traces could help us.  The scale voltage i
161 dangerous (like around 60 kv rough gess) and you need a moving magnetic
162 field to pick up anything by induction.  We need to find a signal line
163 that has a fluctuating magnetic field -- your machine does have rectifying
164 inputs doesn't it?  Input filtering and voltage limiting?  With the rapid
165 rise and fall caused by square waves, we may end up with awfully spikey
166 power!  Not waiting for the bard to answer the piper took a loop of cable
167 and arraomnged it along a likely looking trace.
168 As he worked he spoke:  "My pipes are useless at this scale for several
169 reasons -- the viscosity of the air as bard mentioned, and the scale.  
170 They are simple acoustical resonators -- imagine what their fundamental
171 frequency is at this scale!  I could probably use them for cleaning teeth
172 if the frequency is not too high."  The piper had not noticed the ninja
173 waking behind him.  A rustle caused him to turn... to behold the most 
174 terrifying sight of his life -- a charging ninja brandishing his dreaded
175 stick shift!  Blanching, the piper took a single step backwards, stumbled,
176 and fell as the ninja slowly approached.
177 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
178 +++++++++ Now working on new code............... Milchar +++++++++++++++++++
179 Bard looked up in time to see the ninja attempt to attack Piper. He 
180 responded by throwing a wrench at Ninja. The results of these attacks were
181 rather startling.
182 Bard's wrench describe an exceedingly odd curve, while Ninja was
183 dragged out of line by his stick shift. The magnetic field of the traces had
184 cancelled attacks.
185 Before Ninja could recover Bard had reached over and activated the 
186 stasis. While everyone else was frozen, he bound the ninja and carried him
187 over to the car. He then restored the 'normal' time flow and started a scan 
188 of the ninja. He soon spotted an anomaly in the scan.
189 Using great care (and VERY well insulated tongs) he placed the gem(?)
190 in a stasis capsule and switched the field on at the fourth quantum. There! 
191 Turning to piper he commented, "Don't worry about whether or not
192 it's a signal trace. If it's a power trace I'll just use the MMF inputs 
193 instead of EMF!"
194 They soon had the power packs charged. Voyeur took a look at a meter
195 while bard was charging them and turned white! In a short time, all was 
196 ready. The furry animals had been coaxed into the pack (and everything 
197 secured so that they couldn't hurt it (or themselves). Everyone was in place
198 waiting...
199 Bard entered the co-ordinates & typed "Execute".
200 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
201 The apprentice was almost at the inn when there was a loud "POP" behind
202 him. There in the middle of the road stood L'homme's "car". Climbing out 
203 were Bard, voyeur, Piper, and a stranger with a wolf!

238 THE KEY IS NOT "REBECCA" IE, SOME OF THE WORDS ARE NOT PROPER WORDS, I HAD TO MA
239 KE THEM UP TO FIT; IE 'HISTRIMINE'
240 THE KEY EXISTS IN 3 FORMS. THE FIRST IS IN A BOOK AVAILABLE AT ANY LIBRARY, &MOS
241 T BOOK STORES. IF YOU FIND THE KEY, YOU WILL KNOW WHAT BOOK TO GET, BUT YOU MAY 
242 NOT NEED IT
243 IN THE SECOND FORM, IT IS ALWAYS PRESENT, EVERYWHERE, BUT NO ONE CAN SEE IT.
244 IN THE THIRD, IT IS IN THE WORDS THEMSELVES; IF ANYONE HAS A CERTAIN HOBBY, IT W
245 ILL BE VERY EASY, ESPECIALLY IN LOWER CASE.
246 
247 WHILE THE KEY (FIRST FORM) IS IN THAT BOOK, THE USE OF THE KEY IS UNIQUE, AND WI
248 LL NOT BE FOUND IN ANY BOOK ON CRYPTOGRAPHY, CYPHERS, CODES, ETC.

292 The time is 1984, Portland, Oregon ssets the scene.  Nightwing is making his
293 nightly swing around the city.  He is swinging over the Multnomah County 
294 Coutrthouse, when a strange 'portal' opens in front of him.  Being in midair,
295 Nightwing cannot stop himself from pluging into the portal.  He blacks out
296 a few moments after he enters.
297     When he awakes, he finds himself on a grassy plain.  He doesn't know just
298 quite to make of this situation, but his crime-fighting career has trained him
299 for alomst anything.  His cunning mind makes him think that this not really
300 happening.  His senses assure him that it is real, though.  To the East he sees
301 a large structurre that looks like an old Earth Inn.  He decides that his presen
302 appearance might cause an attraction, which was all that he needed.  Nightwing
303 then concentrates.  His costume is now covered with a large overcoat.  I'm 
304 glad that I bought this new material from Star Labs.  Nightwing then sets
305 off for the building in distance.  I hope there are civilized people around

372 **************************************************************:
373 MORBY: I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT YOU HAVE AS MUCH RIGHT TO LEAVE MESSAGES
374 ON THIS SYSTEM AS ANYONE ELSE (EVEN MILCHAR AND MIG). WHILE OTHERS MAY
375 NOT BE OVERJOYED WITH YOUR DIRECTION OF INPUT, KEEP IN MIND THAT THE
376 SAME IS TRUE OF THEM. THERE ARE OTHER USERS WHO ARE NOT OVERJOYED 
377 WITH THEM. SO YOU SEE, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, YOU CAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE.
378 THAT DOESN'T MEAN EVERYONE HATES YOU THOUGH. BUCK UP!

383 YEAH, REALLY, A LOT OF CODE STUFF. BUT SOMETHING DOESN'T COMPUTE. THOSE WHO ARE 
384 IN THE NET KNOW THE CODE, APPARENTLY. 
385 PRESUMABLY, THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN DON'T.
386 MILCH(AS IN CHURCH)AR IS NOT IN AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO 
387 HAVE 'FORMALLY APPLIED'ERGO HE IS NOT YET IN ; YET MILCHAR KNOWS THE CODE, AS HE
388 WAS, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, ONCE CAUTIONED TO NOT REVEAL TOO MUCH ( I REFER TO
389 LINE 241,THE LAST SENTENCE OF THE LAST MESSAGE, "SORCERY DOES HAVE IT'S ADVANTAG
390 S" ( INCIDENTALLY, i WORKED ON THIS ALL DAY, AND COULD NOT IGURE IT OUT.)
391 LOGICAL CONCLUSION, MILCHAR HAS BROKEN THE CODE. MAYBE HE WILL CRACK MINE. 
392 MILCHAR: NOT<1 OR >4 LETTERS CONTAIN THE KEY.

401 Aaron:Better than Meads??? NEVER!!!! The elements in graphics have been tuned
402 to a fine art. The science is complete, secure, and unbeatable. So be it
403 Evans and Sutherland, so be it. Also, to quote an old saying (too many cooks
404 spoil the stew. Let's put some kind of limit on the number in on the buy.
405 Ninja...yea...he has class (IBM -  I can convert that from CP/M). Voyeur...
406 same goes there...no problemo (as herb would say). Let's stop at 5. Since 
407 we are already going to have to restructure the monetary sequence of events
408 with this odd number. As for MF&E...(MF! ha ha)...It's too bad...but don't
409 give up...He said there may be something in the future....How goes the
410 'C'? Where is this laser printer coming from (and don't hum and haw about!)
411 Still want to sell a backplane/processor/power supply/chassis/slu/multi
412 board? I may be in the market after this month (in July when I get paid 
413 again. It is either a pdp-11 or a 10 meg kamerman for my PC) More
414 later...
415 voyeur...Since this is my first chance on, I will try to salvage the situa
416 tion (hopeless now, we need to give bard a good talking to)
417 ($<#+"($<#$'#"
418 As everyone piled in the car, bard shouted "Hang on!", and with that, he
419 flipped a switch on his console, and everything went black..er white...er
420 green...er..well everything went.... Sounds and sights that had never reached
421 the eyes of L'homme did so. And after a time so short it seemed like an 
422 eternity (this is reality hoping eh?), things started to settle down so a
423 somewhat normal (although this entire adventure has been anything but normal).
424 As the smoke and dust cleared, and the sunlight poked itself through the
425 dirty windows of a battered but alive 1967 mustang, the occupants of said 
426 car opened the doors and poured out onto the dirt road. L'homme, piper, voyyeur,
427 bard, dreamtoucher, snow runner, a grogy ninja, habitrail harry, and several
428 other small creatures had indeed arrived. "But where?", thought L'homme. This
429 isn't the road to Tek! Oh hell! I give up! So I miss out on a 28k/year
430 starting systems programmer job on the local vax 780. I may not know where
431 I am here, but I can learn. And everyone else seems to be quite happy about
432 the whole situation. And as the saying goes, 'When in Rome etc etc etc...'
433 "Come on!" shouted bard. "This way! We are back! The Inn!!!". L'homme
434 followed the others, and took one long glance at his beloved car. "It'll bbe
435 OK here", said voyeur. "This is a low crime area." L'homme caught up with the
436 others, and they all  rushed to the place called the Inn. 
437 In the excitement, everyone had forgotten about the "egg" Bard had placed in
438 what he called a "stasis" field. It lay in the back seat of the car, glowing,
439 humming, and definitly making some attempt at movement. What problems this
440 little "egg" could bring to the Inn and its users, no one can say at the
441 moment, but wouldn't that make a great next adventure??? (HINT HINT HINT)

448 32kwords of(blanch) CORE memory be worth? and what would be a good speed

456     The piper followed his friends, travel stained and weary into the inn.
457 After downing several large containers of the inn's frothy brew, he turned
458 to the bard, "Where did you put our fuzzy little friends?"
459     Hearing that the bard had turned them out of his pack to fend for 
460 themselves, the piper poured a portion of the brew into a saucer, and when
461 no one was watching slid it down next to a suspicious hole near the floor.
462 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
463   Sorry, I did not mean for my msg to come across that way.  It was aimed
464 only at that one group.  I did not know where to reply, except where I got
465 the msg.  I assume that everyone can't hate me here, although a large
466 majority might think I'm a pest.  Don't worry, I leave in 6 hours for England.
467   Anthing else?           Tally Ho(e)  Morby.
468 ................................................................................
469 L'homme, Voyeur, etc: Sorry, but we didn't seem to be getting anywhere. The only
470 real plot development was ninja & I had no desire to fight THAT battle in our 
471 previous location.
472 As for the stasis field, if it starts to hum, glow, or do ANYTHING at
473 all in less than a trillion years... Bard will be the the first to run like mad!
474 (The time factor is about 1E18 to 1!) Of course, I'm gonna get curious and open 
475 my little stasis box....
476 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
477 Bard appeared to be suffering some side effects from handling the "egg".
478 He appeared to be EXTREMELY depressed. He began to sing...

480 Suicide is painless (theme from M*A*S*H)
481 through early morning fog i see
482 visions of the things to be
483 the pains that are withheld for me
484 i realize and i can see
485 Chorus:that suicide is painless
486 it brings on many changes
487 and i can take or leave it if i please
488 the game of life is hard to play
489 i'm gonna lose it anyway
490 the losing card i'll someday lay
491 so this is all i have to say
492 CHORUS
493 the sword of time will pierce our skin
494 it doesn't hurt when it begins
495 but as it works its way on in
496 the pain grows stronger watch it grin(?)
497 CHORUS
498 a brave man once requested me
499 to answer questions that are key
500 "is it to be or not to be"
501 and i replied, "oh why ask me?"
502 suicide is painless
503 it brings on many changes
504 and i can take or leave it if i please
505 and you can do the same thing if you please...

551 Jericho stepped out onto the terrace of his Ney York apartment.  His eyes
552 wandered over the city that he called home.  He thought about all the good
553 adventures that he had before coming to this time.  Jericho has a special
554 'talent' that allows him to travel through the rifts in the Space/Time fabric.
555 He gained this ability about 5 years ago when he allowed the Army to try out
556 a new Anti-Truth serum drug on him.  The drug did strange things to the 
557 chemicals in his body.  Now Jericho, as he now calls himself, can go wherever
558 and whenever that he wishes.  "Enough reminising, Jericho." he tells himself.
559 He gets up, and walks over to the closet, and pulls on a special hanger.  
560 The closet's back wall slides aeway to reveal a secret room filled with mass
561 equipment.  He dons is uniform, and walks through time.
562      When he emerges, he realizes that he is at the Inn his father had told
563 him stories about.  His father was one of the greatest men of his time.  Which-
564 ever time that he happened to be in.  Jericho's father was the man known as
565 The Doctor.  The same Doctor that had to steal the Presidential Septre from
566 Galifrey in order to get the Key to Time.  The same Doctor that had ventured
567 back in time to save the wine.  The same Doctor that had been appointed to the
568 Lord President's Seat.  Jericho's father was a great man.  Now it is up to 
569 Jericho to be as great as The Doctor.  Jericho walks up to the Inn, waits for
570 a moment, then enters...

592 A stranger in a red cape walked by the car. He noticed a strange humming
593 from the back seat, and noticed an egg. As he looked at it, it cracked, and
594 in a great flash of light the shell vanished into a powder.
595    "Zounds! The Rothman Ruby!" the stranger shrieked. And indeed, sitting
596 on the seat, glowing slightly and jiggling through no obvious source of
597 power, was that famous Ruby. It had been stolen some thousand years ago
598 by the then-famous thief Scurrilous, who then vanished mysteriously.
599 The ruby had been untraced throughout that entire time, and here it
600 was!
601    The stranger reached out to pick up the ruby, and as he touched it
602 he vanished in a great flash.
603    The ruby continued to sit there, glowing and moving seemingly under its
604 own power...
605    From the Inn came the sounds of revelry. Little do they know what
606 waits them when they return to their car.
