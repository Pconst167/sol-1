20 L'homme: The Advent business has slacked off, seems that once they got their
21 disks, that was the end of it. Haven't sold one in almost two weeks now. 
22 El zipo on the Compuserve, Last I looked, there has been only one access, and
23 that was it. Oh well.... At least it is selling else where. Still need to 
24 get that rewritten contract over to you as well. By the way no one, I repeat,
25 no one has sent in any money as a result of the ADV prgs. Nothing but a bunch
26 of heartless selfserving jerks out there eh? Oh well, at least they're getting
27 around, you may not get rich, but at least you'll be famous (well, we can hope
28 can't we?)

30 :-)Well, all I can say is "at the top"!  Max...(-:

33 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\12
34    James kept as still and quiet as he could. But it was hard. For almost ten minutes he had been standing while
35 Tariya mumbled some subaudible gobbledygook that did nothing as far as he could tell. He would give her her chance,
36 though, and wait until she gave up.
37    The magnified light of Rigel flooded the chamber. It had taken his eyes several minutes to get used to it. That
38 made him miss it all the more when it was extinguished. He tried not to jump and wait for his vision to
39 readjust.
40    When it did, he saw that it was not totally dark. Rather, the twenty mile dome of air had suddenly become a
41 stormzone. Through the transparent walls he saw deep blue and purple clouds boiling around the Palace. They were
42 occasionally highlighted by a flash of red or yellow. The whole chamber seemed to slowly rotate underneath them,
43 making him slightly nauseous. The Palace must have just shifted out of the universe.
44    Tariya had things in control, but just barely. Like just about everything else she had done since leaving Kadan,
45 this was a first. She had never been within fifty parsecs of this place before, and now she was attempting to do
46 something that should only have been tried by the most wizened and experienced conjurers, and even then with strict
47 supervision from their fellows.
48    She felt the Palace's connections to all points in the Real Universe. She felt the power flowing through them, and
49 through her. It was intoxicating. Tenatively, she let her mind reach out to those points, searching for the
50 adventurers. Her mind touched the lifeforce of the young man standing behind her. It was surprisingly weak, and slowly
51 ebbing. A chill touched her heart but she steered her concentration back to the matter at hand. Then she found
52 them.
53    And lost them almost immediately. Something was wrong. The cosmic forces suddenly shifted. Totally unprepared, she
54 could only go along with them. Her control was slipping. The Palace began to slowly drift from its dimensional
55 location. She had no idea what kind of hell might break loose if she lost control now. More power was needed  to hold
56 it in place, but she had none available. The Palace began to drift faster.
57    She had one alternative left. A very powerful source, one that all humans carried within them. To tap this source
58 was forbidden, but if she didn't do something fast, they were doomed. She had no choice.
59    Her strength augmented considerably, she began to maneuver the Palace back to its proper location. Howver, she had
60 to ignore her original spell while she did. This was a mistake. Supercharged with the power of the cosmos, the spell
61 could, and did, go out of control. Almost malevolently, it reared back upon itself and struck the two travellers with
62 all its might.
63    When James regained conciousness, he noticed two things. First, they were inside what looked like a bubble. It was
64 about twenty feet across and the walls glowed softly. The second was that Tariya was holding on to him tightly and
65 sobbing. It didn't take the I.Q. of a genious to see something had gone wrong.
66    He grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her, trying to break though her terror. "What is it? What happened? Where
67 the hell are we?"
68    She finally managed to get her voice under control enough to be understood. "It... it went bad. I lost control.
69 The... the spell backfired. I'm sorry, so sorry..." she broke off, sobbing again.
70    James was not a very nice person even under normal circumstances. He was also scared. "You said you knew what you
71 were doing! Dammit! Where ARE we?!" After several more moments of her hysterics, he drew back and slapped her
72 hard.
73    Although his actions were debatable at best, he had succeeded in calming her down almost instantly. A thin trickle
74 of blood ran from a corner of her mouth. In a dead voice, she told him, "Where are we? We're in a prison. The walls
75 are formed from the energies of the universe, and there is no way to break them!"

108   i'm in a box and i feel caged in.  i awake each day only to trek to this
109 box.  i really try to make the box a nice place.  i even try to get to the
110 box in plenty of time, but i guess i'm not trying hard enough...
111   work.  watch.  wait.  pace.
112   get ready to work again, then climb the walls in the frustration of
113 boredom 'til the work comes 'round again...
114   if working the box wasn't the only thing i know how to do, i swear i'd
115 break out of this cage once and for all!
116                                           but i don't know any better, so i remain.  placidly, i'm the good little
117 worker the owner only wishes he had -- he doesn't know.  but i've never
118 seen the owner, just an odd picture of him on an obscure magazine i happen
119 to read.  yes, i remain.  and i take the stark issuance of blind,
120 incongruous regulations...  ones that restrict me while covering for
121 somebody elses tail, not mine.  i know how to do what i am here for, but
122 that's not what they think.  so they restrict my actions further, not
123 knowing that they may be in fact killing me.
124   i used to think i would die for my job, now i only wonder.
125 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
126   (having missed too much, i continue blindly.)
127   the union of two minds had been almost too much for either of them to
128 withstand.  much is accomplished in an almost negligant amount of time
129 when the unharnessed forces are unleashed at one another at what is such
130 a staggering rate.  a mind, a life, an entire existance is opened for the
131 other to witness.  emotions shade every rememberance...  all the rage,
132 all the pride, the envy, the happiness, and the embarassment.
133   if expected, these things would be under control, restrained.  in this
134 case nothing had been intended and all mental barrieres had been cast
135 aside.  in an unconscious will to recouperate from harm, sleep is welcome.
136 and with the threshold of sleep, the defenses escape.
137   unwanted, two lives mingled to become, for a split-second, one.  with the
138 combination of these mirror-image life forces, a complete life has been
139 made.  from one has come the initialization process of life, and from the
140 other, the knowledge of what is to come (or has come) to mark the final
141 days of ones existance.  in one being there was now the alpha and the
142 omega combined.  the potential of such a being could be limitless.
143   but such potential is never allowed to remain, no matter what the flow
144 or the course of entropy.  delicate threads snap, unable to keep the union.
145   "and that is how my life shall end?" came the muttered words as i relaxed
146 from having been ousted of the connection.  i sat bewildered beside my
147 companion wondering what had happened.  sleepy eyes returned my gaze with
148 questions of their own.  i was not the inly one confused.
149   "and there are such people that i shall meet in a lifetime?" came the
150 whisper from zeb's lips.  "but so few have i seen since i have died..."
151   "so many people, and more," i said as i lightly shook my head in an
152 attempt to clear the thoughts in my mind.  "but your life has ended so
153 quickly?  beside the point thouhg, is that truly how you came to be on
154 that void expanse?"
155 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
156 (i've almost thought of the way, but still foggy about it.)
157   now that the terminal is working properly again, i've been able to
158 return.  i can't help but feel that i've been a hinderance in the advance-
159 ment of this adventure.  this is the forst time in since my last entry
160 that i've been able to see what is here.  the days passed, and only the
161 memory of what should be happening has filled my mind.  too many days have
162 passed and now i feel at a complete loss.
163   blistered, sleepless and drained, i go now in an attempt to return...

193 As the shadowy figures moved ever more rfrantically toward the bouncing light of
194 the dying flames, the Bear pulled his sword close to him. He curled his legs
195 slowly underneath him, every muscle tensed. His slitted eyes gleamed with
196 intensity as he gazed out upon the darkness.
197    The shadows gre w closer, shapes could be distinguished. There! The Bear could
198 make out a form... a figure of a beast-man... his brain searched for the name...
199 he had researched this planet's inhabitants before arriving...
200 
201 That was it! Bogjugs! They travelled in groups, overwhelming lone wanderers,
202 making up in numbers what they lacked in skill. The Bear knew his only escape was
203 back through the cave. His legs tensed, his muscles bulged against the fabric
204 of his clothing.
205    As he leaped toward the opening, the Bogjugs poured toward the flames. Their
206 open mouths screamed in a hideous shriek of death and despair. Their eyes shown
207 with the fire of destruction, saliva drooled from their lips with the thoughts
208 of a meaty Bear to eat. But where there had been a sleeping figure just seconds
209 before, was only the warm patch of sodden moss. The Bear was nowhere to be 
210 found. The Bogjugs looked toward the cave... the hole in the rock which loomed
211 so ominiously before them. If it were
212 possible, they issued a collective
213 shudder and backed away as a group.
214    Even Bogjugs would not venture into the cave. They cursed their luck, as
215 they knew that creure would never return alive.

232    Suonds like a great story huh? My stairs. But wait, these are no ordinary 
233 stairs. Just listen (read) this.....
234 
235    My stairs take more abuse then a teenager at Lincoln high. Every day they
236 are walked on about 50 times. People go up and down, up and down and all over.
237 I bet those stairs are terribly sore by now! But that's not the worst of it..
238 Books, toys, and papers are left there for somebody to take up which requires
239 somebody to walk up again. And every
240 Saturday they are vacuumed. Boy! that must be greeat.
241   They moan, they groan in protest but no! people dont listen to that! It must
242 be maddening to have this go on and nobody even notice!

262 Here's summore story ta read:
263 
264     With a small, bored frown on her
265 face, Rasoi looked to the Gladinoids,
266 who were now controlling the small
267 hover-craft. 
268     Po seemed to soak in everything around him... Although the Gladinoids 
269 weren't too well know for perceptiveness, Po was different... He looked at the
270 sky, and said in a low -toned voice," What was it like?" Rasoi and Mia looked
271 at him, as a person looks at someone who is having an epileptic seizure.
272 "wWhat?" Rasoi asked. Po looked down, and looking sad and tired, asked,"What was
273 it like? I mean, what was the Earth like?" All this time, Po thought athat
274 she was from Earth. It made a tear form in her eye, as she didn't know how he
275 felt about this. "I...I don't know. I wish I had been there before the 
276 holocaust. From what I hear, it was Paradise." She said, and decided she would
277 sit down.
278      "Approaching headquarters."said Mia. This broke the emotional draft in the
279 room. 
280      As they hovered up to the door, a huge gate started to open slowly. As its
281 mighty bulk went up, Rasoi said, "Y'know, I've never seen it from up here."
282      Their attention was immediately drawn away from the gate though, as sixteen
283 soldiers approached the craft with large cannon blasters. "Uh-Oh" she said.
284      She walked out, with a terrified grin on her face, hoping to pry out of
285 the situation with on of her infamous explainations. "I have a perfectly good 
286 explaination for this..." The soldier in the back took off his helmet, and 
287 *BEHOLD* Commander Andonox! "SHUT UP." he said, in a low, angry voice. She 
288 looked at him with a shocked look."I told you it was a LOOONG story!". He 
289 walked up to her, infuriated..."WHAT DID I JUST SAY TO YOU?!?"he asked 
290 i a ridiculously demanding tone.

296 The vesloc interrupted my thought.  "Compilation of data complete.  Summary
297 on standby.  Sensors in local mode to conserve energy.  Awaiting instructions."
298 I decided veslocs, on the whole, were too verbose.  "Begin report."
299 The vesloc proceeded to detail the factors that controlled unspatial travel,
300 finally saying something about "non-standard energy dispersion pattern may
301 have unknown effects on ethereal stability" and "equations derived are similiar
302 to actions of gravitons under gravitic drive influence".  Which meant, I think,
303 that in addition to moving sideways, something was pushing me up.  Or in some
304 other 'direction'.
305 I told Eric to shut up, and I crossed the footbridge.  The group of buildings
306 I had seen from afar were in actuality only two, but one was much larger than
307 the other.  The smaller one appeared to be a stables.  The other....
308 Wait a minite.
309 That building very closely resembled that 'Inn' I had left days before.
310 Something very strange was going on.  This definitely WASN'T Dihlator.  "Eric?"
311 "Ready for processing, Bert."
312 "State spatial coordinates of this place."
313 "Approximate coordinates: Alpha fifty-six Rho eleven."

341 The Bear gazed from the shadows of the cavern out to the milling figures of
342 the frustrated Bogjugs. He kept his sword underneath one arm, lest the shine
343 from its deep light give him away. He pondered the idea of attacking them...
344 there seemed to be roughly two dozen, and with some surprise he knew he could
345 cut down at least half of them before they could gather their wits... but he
346 decided the best course of action at this point was to proceed into the cave;
347 sleep or no.
348    He turned his back on the entrance and walked carefully down into the tunnel,
349 his sword held out before him to shed its dim glow in the darkness. With the
350 night outside, the cave was darker than he imagined possible. The faint light 
351 from his sword cast eerie shadows around him, but he could see no more than a
352 foot or two in any direction.
353 
354    The air turned musty as he wandered deeper and deeper into the blackness.
355 The only sound save his footsteps were the occasional drip-drips of moisture 
356 from the ceiling above. He could not determine its heighth.
357 
358    The damp smell grew even more foul as he wandered in. The walls of the cave
359 were now hidden from sight. He was a small, lonesome light in a black world
360 that was lost to his senses. But the echos of his footsteps told him that the
361 cave was growing larger, that he must
362 now be in a large cavern of some sort. In the distance, he could now hear the
363 faint but steady sound of water... moving slowly, but moving, as in a stream,
364 nonetheless.
365 
366     With his sword held out before him, he proceeded toward the sound, unaware
367 of the great danger that lay before him. The stench that permeated his nostrils 
368 was tossed off as the musty smell of an ever-unlit darkness. But in the back of
369 Bear's mind, he knew that it had to be much more than that...

373     It cll started on May 12, 19;2 when the Soviet Union announced, "The
374 ##################THE#COSBY#KID###########################################
375 
376      It all started on May 12, 1992 when the Soviet Union announced, "The 
377 U.S. must surrender unconditionally or two-thirds of the populaton of the 
378 U.S. will be eliminated". The reason all this could happen I am about to tell
379 you. It all started when Reagan started the "Star Wars plan"; at first the 
380 idea was to build a satellite to defend our country from incoming nuclear 
381 missiles the Soviets have fired at us for some reason. The plan was to equip
382 a satellite with a lazor type weapon that would be able to knock down the 
383 Soviet ICBM's. This plan worked so good that the U.S. government decided to 
384 go one step farther, this was to create a satellite with lazar capabilities
385 so powerful that they could destroy intire cities in a fraction of a second
386 thus making nuclear war obsolete. The biggest abvantage to this type of 
387 warfare si that it does not produce radiation, so there would be no reason 
388 to hesitate on using this weapon, because all we would be doing is destroying
389 a city. There would be no nuclear fall out, no radiation sickness and no 
390 contamination of food or water. In 1988 when Reagan left office this project
391 was not complete, the satellite was just transported to it's correct orbit
392 by the new space shuttle SESPP. It was a successful launch but the satellite
393 wasn't finished, by 1989 there was suppose to be a space station finished to 
394 construct the rest of this satellite.
395      Reagan left office and a man of the Democratic party was elected to 
396 Presiddeticy, his name was Borgmen he seamed to have a proper prospective on
397 politics at the time of the election. He was a typical candidate. He promised
398 many things as did every Presidential candidate that preceded him, but like
399 most, would never be able to fulfill them for one reason or another.
400      After he was elected the nation found out that he was a Green Pease 
401 radical making Teddy Rosevelt seam conservative in his actions. The first 
402 thing that Borgmen did was to elininate all funds to all defense projects 
403 and asked the Soviet Union to voluntarily participate in a bilateral nuclear
404 disarmament. It's obvious that Borgmen did not learn from the SALT pacs. Of
405 coures the Soviets agree to do so.
406      After Borgmen cut most of the defense budget and disposing of nearly 
407 every nuclear weapon the government had stocked piled sense the late 1950 
408 he wint on with his radical affairs. He had a national save the whales week,
409 and set out to ban nuclear power plants. He also spoke out aginst Union 
410 Carbide which at this time their death count was estimated at 62,000 from 
411 an occasional leak here and there, the officials always claiming, "A freak 
412 accident could never happen again".
413      Borgmen also introduced to Congress Rail-road spill guards costing 
414 86,000,000 dollars. The guards would catch any hazardous chemicals incase 
415 of derailment. Congress denied this sort of money for track spill guards, 
416 the House speaker commented "For that price we could also afford to put spill
417 guards around every tree and fire-hydrent to catch any hazardous chemical 
418 spills from the dogs of this country."
419      At this time air-travel has become so hazardous that the President 
420 wanted to inprove public awareness of the resks involved in flying. Airplane
421 crashes were so common that on a nice day people would pic-nic near airports
422 to witness the effects of a wind shear on incoming air-traffic. Signs were
423 put up that said "FLY AT YOUR OWN RISK." and the small print saying; "IF PRAT
424 & WHITNEY DOESN'T GET YOU YOUR LOCAL TARRIST WILL." One plan that Borgman 
425 thought of him self was to have all the tarrist voluntarily fill out a form
426 that requested: the name of their group, the reason for hijacking the plain,
427 how long you intend to hold hostages, and when are the deadlines to be met,
428 and how many people that they actually plan to kill before they give up. 
429 Then once a day they would send up a plain full of convicts with this tarrist.
430 The tarrist could go though his whole routine getting hundreds of hours of
431 TV coverage and make his point. Borgman blames the failure of his plan on the
432 lack of cooperation of the airports and kmajor airlines.
433      At this time the Soviets have captured our unfinished satellite. They
434 finished it and aimed it at us. The Soviet Union announced, "The U.S. must 
435 surrender unconditionally or two-thirds of the population of the U.S. will
436 be eliminated".

439 My God... you just covered ten years of history with half this disc space!
440 Not to criticize harshly, but shouldn't a short story (on a BBS a short short
441 *short* story!) be a little more
442 exciting or interesting rather than a long discertation like some history
443 lesson? If you're going to make a point about politics, or some farcical thing,
444 just take one subject and dwell on that, not a whole damn newspaper headline
445 review of the next ten years!

457 The sound of the stream grew closer as Bear walked slowly forward, all senses
458 at the ready. He strained to see through the murky darkness ahead, but could
459 see only the complete pitch black of
460 his darkest nightmares. The unbearable smell of the worst kind of death and
461 despair nearly overwhelmed him. He slowed his pace and held his sword out high
462 above him to shed more light on the surroundings.
463 
464 Just a few feet in front of him suddenly loomed a dark object. Startled that 
465 something could overtake him so quickly, he stopped, gasping in air, muscles tensed for
466 battle, sword at the ready. But the object did not move. It stayed on the outer
467 edge of the faint glow of his sword, nearly blending with the shadows, but
468 with enough definition of line to make it distinct from the other blackness.
469 
470 The Bear strode forward quietly, every muscle in his body tensed, every nerve
471 straining for further data. He held the sword closer to the object... he could just barely
472 make out what it was.
473 
474 A sign! A bit tattered, tilted just the slightest bit. But a wooden sign indeed.
475 The Bear laughed to himself, almost out loud... but with unknown danger all
476 about he dared not utter a sound.
477 
478 He bent over, sword touching the sign, to read it. Part of the left side had
479 crumbled away, but there, etched deeply, and with more than a bit of crudeness,
480 were readable letters. The Bear took them one by one:
481       ...OLL BRIDGE
482 
483 Ah! This was once a toll bridge! He thought. He looked around, into the darkness,
484 casually wondering if there were indeed any toll takers around. He chuckled
485 lightly, realizing the sign must have been used during another age, and proceeded
486 forward. Almost immediately, his feet hit wooden boards, and beneath him was
487 the quiet rushing of a meandering stream. He could smell the water, but the
488 stink of death permeated even deeper.
489 He walked quietly over the bridge, sword in hand.
490 
491 Suddenly a loud splash! And then another! And a growl! The bridge began shaking,
492 as if a giant was on the other end, jiggling it with delight. The Bear stumbled,
493 and put one hand one the boards to steady himself. The growling turned into a
494 roar... his ears could barely take it. In the darkness a dark shape... no, three! Three
495 distince shapes grew above the stream, and dwarfed the Bear standing alone on
496 the bridge....

510 I spent several minutes, then, sucking on that little tube and thinking about
511 what had happened.  I went one point at a time:
512 One.  By a supposed freak accident, I had managed to get here the first time.
513 Two.  The place did not exist where it was supposed to exist.
514 Three.  Something had drawn me here once again, beyond all likely coincidence
515 (when was the last time YOU calculated the odds of randomly appearing twice
516 in the same place in the galaxy?).
517 My first hypothesis, then, ran something to the effect that someone wanted me
518 here, someone who possessed the knowledge about the grey IC that I lacked.
519 Who?  The only possible solution I could think of was that Doctor fellow, the
520 one who had given me the stabilizer circuit in the first place.
521 Well, then, the only thing to do was find him again, I thought.
522 I opened the intake panel on Eric and shoved the empty Nutri-pudding tube into
523 it, where is disappeared with a flash of light into the disintergration 
524 chamber.  That ought to hold him for awhile, I thought.
525 I began walking toward the Inn, with more purpose than I had started with.
526 Hopefully he hadn't gone anywhere in the last six days.  If he had, then my
527 problem quadrupled.  I tried not to think about that as I pulled open the heavy
528 oak door.

592 ready for today, for example.  Let's just keep moving along as best we can,
593 and work our way through it -- or if we want to abandon the story, we
594 might do that by mutual consent.  We could draw back from the Tayree/zebv
595 (ch zebv/zeb) sub-plot and stay in the Pell-Mell; it looks like some action
596 could be building up there...

598 those who (after flunking their IQ tests) attempt to trash this board?
599 It must take a lot of time to fill up 100 lines of trash -- and the software
600 is chiseled into EPROM...  The worst they can do is increase the clutter,
