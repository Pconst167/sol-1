 23 This is in reply to the last post on the last disk.  
 24  
 25 No, I don't believe everything the state department spews.  I tend to be VERY
 26 cynical, and I am thus seldom dissapointed.
 27  
 28 And, I can see how saddam makes sense to many arabs.  They do have some very
 29 fair and real complaints.  Problem is, I feel they have chosen a real lammo
 30 as their hero.  Saddam will not be taken seriously by anybody outside of the
 31 middle east (Other then as an effective "strongman") after his kuwait debacle.
 32 Then again, I don't see anybody else in the area that is any better.  The
 33 King of Jordan is only speaking out because he is being forced to.  This is 
 34 also true of many of the others that are moving to saddams side.  
 35  
 36 Not that I question the popularity of saddam in these countrys.  I DO however
 37 question the sincerity of the governments in supporting him.  
 38  
 39 I don't own a car, am a semi-vegitarian, and tend to dress in a very low key
 40 manner.  The point I am trying to make here is that I am a much smaller part
 41 of this problem then most people,  and that I am willing to change my life
 42 style in order to help make the world a better place to live in.  And I still
 43 support the war.  Not for the reasons spewed by the state department, but rathe
 44 r because I do want the world to be a better place to live in.

 53 I see they've appointed Arno Denecke to head the committee to evaluate
 54 the education plan presented by the Black United Front et al.  He's not
 55 only a former board member, but probably a neighbor (or former neighbor
 56 to "Joe" Rieke and Ross Dey.  His daughter also attended Lincoln when 
 57 the varsity football team gang raped a girl in my class (and a neighbor
 58 of some of my friends AND Scott Cress btw), then cut class en masse', 
 59 meeting in front of the office if I remember correctly, to go to a health 
 60 clinic to be checked fo ... and nothing was ever done or said about it.
 61 And she was there whethe predeceessor of Jonathan what's his face lauded
 62 these same boys in o of his columns for the "Oly" dots on their club
 63 sweatshirts ... the columnist who wrote the abt the town abort, was
 64 later fired by the Oregonian, then appointed youth director at the downown
 65 church.  The gang raped girl, btw, jumped off a local brid a coule of years
 66 ago -- almost 20 years later.

 91 And since the Denecke's lived within two blocks of the Cress's, that meant
 92 they also lived with five blocks of the victim ... kind of another trickle
 93 down order, I'd say.   The Denecke's lived on Westover, I believe, in a
 94 larger older-money type home; the Cress's by the stairs a block away that
 95 went from Westover to Overton or whatever street is on the south side of
 96 Chapman school, in a newer, more middle class house, and then Candy, on 26th,
 97 or whatever street that is in front of Wallace Park ... on the second floor
 98 of a modest (or less) apartment building.  As far as I knew, she was not
 99 a pegged as a whore, was just a nondescript, average looking girls that didn't
100 appear to hang with anybody.  I never heard the story first-hand, but did
101 hear others about these same guys putting other girls through ordeals at
102 other such "parties," and even knew one who went through some ritual abuse
103 with some of them ... for a year.  I saw her a couple of years ago at a 
104 restaurant by my house, and she made some reference to it, but I can't 
105 remember exactly what she said, but she'd had a crush on David Glover and
106 I think she went through it so he'd pay attention to her.  Then David's
107 sister was tormented about the same way by Donney Kneese et al.  
108  
109 I've often wondered, myself, if Scott's brother Pat was involved.  He was the
110 youngest of the Cress clan ... they had one kid in every class level when I
111 was a sophomore, but I think Pat was two or three years younger than Scott.  
112 I ran into him on a bus one night after work ... he was stumble-bum drunk and
113 hardly coherent.  He recognized me and struck up a conversation, such as it
114 was, making somewhat a spectacle of it all.  Somebody said he was an "artist."
115  
116 Scott went on to become head dorm trasher and food fighter at U of O, married
117 his school sweetheart and is a hero to this day ... he was featured some
118 years back on Valentine's Day in an Oregonian article.  I heard Dave was in
119 a mental institution but had been a potter at one time.

129 Actually, I thought PPS would select somebody from PSU's Education Dept.
130 to head their investigating committee ... like Rick Hardt, whose wife
131 worked at PPS and had arranged to have free publisher textbook samples 
132 sent down to the PSU Education Department where, it was rumored, they
133 were used as merchandise for a book sale they had every year.  Couldn't
134 help wondering what they did with the slush fund thus created.  Used to
135 piss me off they probably funded the champagne party to celebrate the 
136 firing of their president with that money ... or perhaps as a donation to
137 the VANGUARD to print a special edition to ridicule him.
138  
139 I thought one Virginia McElroy would make a good second choice.  She's
140 from the Ed Dept too ... worked "too closesly (wink)" with Dr. Hart, as
141 a matter of fact, as his wife once said.  Ginny's in charge of assigning
142 PSU students to PPS classrooms as student teachers.  After the guy died
143 who's responsibility it was to deal with the publisher's samples and had
144 written to the publishers saying the books were going to university educa-
145 tion departments and I felt obliged to ask some questions, I was threatened
146 that Dr. Hardt's wife was going to place one of her PSU students (she 
147 teachs at PSU too ... Dr. Hardt is in charge of hiring ... and firing) in
148 MY friend's 4th classroom downstairs ... even though it was his first year
149 with his own classroom and the first year he'd worked full time for PPS. 
150@Coincidence or what ... he died four months later.

160 After finding out we were being forced to used WordStar, I became interested
161 in transferring to one of the few departments at PPS who overrode administra-
162 tive orders and insisted on using WordPerfect.  I was informed at that time
163 my personnel file looked pretty bad ... there was a bad evaluation and a 
164 negative letter from a staff member.  I was mighty surprised 'cause I'd 
165 CHECKED my file myself, and had commented to two staffers in Personnel I wa
166 s glad Pat North saw fit not to leave it in without making a fuss.  I knew
167 NOTHING about a negative letter, so one of the people I worked for insisted
168 she and I go to Pesonnel to check it out.  And sure enough, the evaluation was
169 there ... the letter wasn't.  But if that wasn't enough, Personnel insisted I
170 couldn't be considered for the job I had been offered because my transfer
171 materials weren't up-to-date.  Seems they'd changed the rules the very year
172 I filled out a transfer form so that you'd have to submit a form EVERY year.
173 I was, of course, very hesitant to approach Personnel for ANYTHING after that.

199 L'homme, I've been reviewing the first season of Twin Peaks, and while the last
200 few episodes have had their moments, they don't come anywhere close to the
201 first season.  I do however see some promising signs, and I'm hoping that 
202 they rally will bring the series back.  I intend to write my letter to ABC
203 sometime within the next week.  (Got to bury them in paper.) :-)
204  
205 Now, I noticed something interesting in episode 1001 (The first episode after
206 the pilot.)  at one point, Donna is telling her mother about how she and
207 James have been falling in love.  Now, just before this scene ther is a section
208 where they show a bit of the video tht James shot of Laura and Donna a 
209 couple of weeks earlier, while they were on their picknick.  The clip
210 ends with a close up of Lauras face, which freezes.  and just before
211 it cuts to the scene with Donna and her Mother we hear quitly, and in a
212 low voice "Help Me".  Very Strange.
213  
214 Now, it seems to me that this ties in pretty well with Josie in the drawer
215 knob.  Could it be that BOB has the power to trap souls?  could it be that
216 The Log Ladys husband was traped by BOB in the log?  could it be that 
217 Laura is trapped, along with Maddy in some other objects?
218 And what about Ghostwood Estates?  interesting name eh?
219  
220 More speculation.  The real story of Twin Peaks starts when Window Earl
221 turned to the dark side so to speak.  At that point he drew Cooper in,
222 and now, things are really starting to come to a head in Twin Peaks. 
223 conciously or unconciously, Josie was involved with the dark side.  Thus
224 her attempt to kill Cooper.
225  
226 Well, I could go on, but its late, I'm tired, and I don't want to bore
227 anybody.  Suffice it to say, that things seem to be coming together nicely.
228 Now, if they can just get a little closer to the quality of the first 
229 season, the I'll be a very happy camper.

250                 A Few Notes On The End Of The Conflict Overseas
251                                       From
252                               -+|[ ThingFish ]|+-
253  
254             With the end of hostilities in the Gulf, American
255          corporate and government facilities will be able to worry a
256          little less about terrorism before long. Say, sometime in the
257          next five or six generations.
258  
259               The TV news coverage in the hours following the cease-
260          fire had nearly all the giddy surrealism of January 16, if
261          not the range; most networks managed to keep their regularly
262          scheduled sitcoms and commercials up and running with minimal
263          interruptions.
264  
265               Early pictures of celebrations in newly liberated Kuwait
266          City certainly had an odd twang to them.  Huge chanting
267          Middle Eastern crowds, all flailing arms, beards and American
268          flags.  It looked so strangely familiar, yet something about
269          the scene was not quite right, something was missing.  Then I
270          figured it out.  This was the first time I'd ever seen
271          satellite footage of Arab mobs waving around American flags
272          that weren't on fire.  Truly bizarre.
273  
274               Another odd moment was a CNN interview with a Kuwaiti
275          Military Officer--also identified as a member of the Kuwaiti
276          Royal family--who was the leader of an American trained elite
277          special forces unit. Their job was to locate and flush out
278          bands of Iraqi stragglers holed up in houses in Kuwait City
279          suburbs. He spoke immaculate English with a gentle Texan
280          accent...lot's of "I'm damn proud of my men, we had us a job
281          to do and we did it." I got the feeling that, special forces
282          or not, this man's real tactical purpose was to gee-whiz the
283          hell out of 'em on CNN when the time came.
284  
285               There was something unsettling also about the immediate
286          talk of how, when Johnny comes marching home THIS time,
287          America is going to welcome her fighting forces with open
288          arms, ticker tape parades, parties, tax-breaks and government
289          cash.
290  
291               There's no question that someone called up out of a nice
292          family and comfortable job to spend six months in a stinking
293          desert--sleeping on a cot, sand in every orifice, dinner out
294          of a bag, and not even a cold beer to ease the fear of death
295          by fire--these men and women deserve every back-slapping
296          homecoming parade we care to muster.
297  
298               But what about the Vietnam Veterans?
299  
300               What about the hundreds of thousands of guys who were
301          jerked out of their childhoods, dropkicked into a full year
302          jungle bloodbath where some saw more soldiers become bodies
303          in a day that Desert Storm counted in the entire operation,
304          and then were flown home to spend the rest of their lives
305          being sh*t on by everyone from their family to Hollywood?
306          What about those guys?
307  
308               In a mad lurch to not repeat the hurt visited upon
309          returning Vietnam Veterans, I hope we don't end up twisting
310          the knife in their backs. Of all the mistakes we seem doomed
311          to repeat, please God, not that one again.

346 Twin Peaks is coming back!  It'll be on at 9pm on thursdays.  Starting March
347 28.  Of course, this puts in opposite of Cheers, which is ratings suicide.
348  
349 The question is, will it make it beyond this season.

368 TF, they may try to kill TP, but I suspect they'll have a fight on their 
369 hands.

371 As for how it will all turn out... Hard to say.  I do not believe that 
372 the Laura Palmer story is really over.  Josie getting sucked into the 
373 knob only reinforces this feeling.  
374  
375 Therre is I believe a fairly complex underlying story that TP has been
376 slowly reveling to us.  Most people unfortunetly have been to impatiant 
377 to stick with it.  Coops arrival in Twin Peaks caused the stirring of
378 powerfull forces.  
379  
380 Jach Renoits(sp?) speach, Joisies reason for shooting him, Lauras final
381 stand, they are all part of the prelude to a large and deadly confrontation.
382 Things over the next six episodes are going to get very ugly, and very
383 scary.
384  
385 I'm looking forward to the Lynch directed episode.  He has a tendancy to
386 make things interesting.
387  
388 You know, I hate horror movies, yet I'm thouraghly addicted to TP.  To

400 Far be it for me, a mere middle-aged secretary (from a time before xeroxes
401 and electric typewriters ... a stor in itself and, evidently according to
402 district "standards," a sin and handicapping condition) to presume to
403 questionthe authority/integrity of a top-heavy senior administration OR
404 the lawyer-laden board who set up the PPS board zones and voting process,
405 BUT I'd always kinda wondering why Portland's westside, with under 20
406 schools of the 100+ total, always seems to hold 3 of 7 positions on the
407 school board.
408  
409 A chat with County Elections last Monday revealed that office neither sets
410 policy nor zones but DOES offer three standard methods of selecting/elect-
411 ing candidates:  1) AT LARGE/AT LARGE, used by very small districts, 2) BY
412 ZONE/AT LARGE, used by larger districts like Tigard and Beaverton, and 3)
413 BY ZONE/BY ZONE.  I suggested, inview of the way the district had set up
414 zoning, with three zones emanatig from a region with only two high school
415 feeder areas as opposed to seven (not counting Benson) on the "other" side,
416 that a ZONE/ZONE rather than a ZONE/AT LARGE vote might create a more
417 informed board with a wider awareness of the REAL problems confronting the
418 district.  I was, therefore, suprised and disappointed that the "Stacked
419 Deck/Aint-it-a-Shame/Minority-Candidates-Always-Fall-Through-the-Cracks"
420 article by Jerry Boone in Thursday's OREGONIAN included neither the School
421 Board Postion Zone map smacking of gerrymadering (given the chosen voting
422 process) nor a discussion of optional processes that might work better for
423 districts with diverse inner-city populations.
424  
425 It also seemed odd that Bill Graves, in an article on the next page,
426 excluded ROBERT PHILLIPS from his list of people reportedly working to
427 replace the current "insensitive, arogant, secretive (ans possibly 
428 corrupt as WILLAMEATE WEEK may seemingly imply/infer, whichever)" incum-
429 bents with more informed, involved and culturally diverse candidates as he 
430 IS the most obvious victim of this system.  The araticle also left me with
431 the false impression that the not-really-a-candidate Mr. Pansky endorsed
432 Steven Kafoury over the more representational "real world" candidate.  I
433 find it insulting, frustrating and possibly racist that a white candidate
434 from the Irvington district -- a small yonder yuppiedom often mentioned as
435 a favorite haunt of our esteemed elitist "garden party" columnist and an
436 area more typical of the Grant dynasty or the "le Miz, M/M Jean Valjean"
437 Lincoln/Wilson kindgom -- continues to insist on dominating the service of
438 an area he has so blatantly and rudely ignored, rejected and locked out.  
439 As *I believe* the Black United Front has tried to point out, the Jefferson
440 district IS primarily poor and downtrodden, and I might add, isolated and
441 oppressed (thru a seeminly wasteful and unnecessary "cluster
442 " system manned by McElroy-appointed heavies).
443  
444 Endorsements (AND bucks/bodies) for Kafoury provided by PPS's unionS and
445 the editor of THE OREGONIAN despite consisten accounts of his personal
446 disinterest, preoccupation and irresponsibility, plus the projected
447 collective indifference and questionable credibility/corruptibility of
448 the board, show a similar callousness, arrogance and unwillingness to
449 recognize or deal with the real issues behind the seething anger and
450 discontent laying (lying?) just under the "soothingly calm" exterior the
451 district has seemed t exude the last six years.  Lack of union support
452 for the only incumbent willing to admit a possible need for change is
453 also very telling.  "Paying off" discontents will prove to be only a 
454 temporary AND EXPENSIVE "patch."
455  
456 I think the "noble and majestic" thing for Kafourty to do would be to
457 step down from his domination of this board seat and, through his **OTHER
458 SEVEN** board appointments (no wonder he seems deadened and detached), 
459 begin to slant his legislative lobbying efforts towards elevating dignity
460 and self-esteem in Portland's schoolrooms and workplaces.  Perhaps PPS's
461 labor unions could follow suit and actually DO what has traditinally been
462 expected of unions and what PPS employees have been **FORCED** to pay them
463 for.  (BTW, what **DOES** the Federatin do with that third of a million
464 dollars a year anyway ... uhhhh, besides successfully processing sexual
465 harrassment claims???).

569 ---------------------------------------A stitch in time saves nine ....
570  
571 Still showing no signs of stifling my stupidity and having nothing to
572 lose but my rights to that, I've decided to vent my spleen once again ...
573 this time about the Ames/Steinfeld Dynasty and Family Coalition we seem
574 to read so much about lately (do they have agents or what?)  YAWN.  Last
575 summer it was a photo feature on Elsie, exclusive world-class charity
576 non-profit gift shop missionary and peach mogul (among other things), 
577 who befriended a famous Native American author way back when ... and in
578 the fall nephew and distinguished pickle magnate Ray Jr. graced the pages,
579 sporting some swell hair and heading the yearly charity festivities for
580 OMSI.  Then last week it was one Sara Ames, a rather highly paid assistant
581 to the governor, demanding OREGONIAN powers that be to stitch the lips of
582 her former colleague (albeit briefly) about the public pursestrings ...
583 and within days the ever-insufferable PJ does a column touting Bob's huge
584 Port party for 600 of his closest friends.
585  
586 Now in last Wednesday's SNOREGONIAN we discover Bob, president of the Port
587 of Portland and 1st Interstate Bank, also works for Associates for Portland
588 Progress as, of all things, an authority on cost cutting for government
589 bureaus.  A solution, says Bob, will be found in the use of contracted
590 labor and temporary and part-time workers, relating that 3/4 of his bank's
591 staff now works part time.  Odd, I thought to myself, because Bob not only
592 appears to be working overtime at two of his THREE jobs but his recent
593 "Party" didn't exactly reflect bureaucratic cost cutting.
594  
595 Not that I'm against job sharing.  It's a GREAT **option** when sharees
596 reveive medical benefits and vacation/holidays/sick leave.  In fact, I'd
597 always thought less drudge/more leisure was one of the eventual ames of
598 the Industrial Revolution.  And if more people were willing to gear down
599 and sacrifice half their salary, more jobs would become available for
600 others.  But paying benefits for two people to do one job doesn't exactly
601 cut costs.
602  
603 And Bob doeson't say JOB SHARE anyway and as we all know, part-time workers
604 don't usually receive benefits and temporary workers have neither adequate
605 benefits nor guarantees of continuous work.  I, myself, was a "temp" for
606 5-6 years too many years ago to mention, but I think I can safely say that
607 most bureaucracies systematically hired temporary workers simply as a ploy
608 to prove a need for additional staff/funds or to deplete current funds that,
609 if not spent, would tend to reduce future allocations.  As there was 
610 usually little work to do in these fill-in position-holding assignments,
611 I'd bring my own projects and, like a true bureaucrat, would find myself
612 feeling almost angry if they occasionally DID find something for me to "do."
613  
614 But because his "crisis cutback" recommendations appear to be aimed
615 primarily at masses of "useless underlings," who COULD perform well under
616 proper management, while maintaining hordes of ineffective middle managers
617 who will eventually game play their way back to previous funding/staffing
618 levels once a sales tax is implemented if for no other reason that just
619 to have something to "manage," or worse, the equally excessive number of
620 power-hungry senior "execs" who most probably also extort exhorbitant
621 salaries, Bob's recommendations seem short-sighted fixes that would
622 guarantee the preservation of that same vicious and ever-perpetuated
623 civil service cycle once again.
624  
625 Most dangerous, though, are those contract labor firms who would induce
626 employers to dump unionized crews by promising not so much to reduce costs
627 as to reduce possible liability, then bring in their own notoriously under-
628 paid, poorly supported/supervised replacement teams who, due to poor morale
629 and the resultingly high turnover, more often than not perform shoddily,
630 thereby causing company-wide frustration that spreads poor morale like
631 cancer.  And only party that comes out ahead is the contractor, who will
632 probably make enough not to have to pay taxes.
633  
634 Meanwhile Bob -- likely a millionaire to start through no particular inher-
635 ent talents of his own -- undoubtedly receives a pretty package of pay and
636 perks from the bank for his obvious part-time work there.  And although his
637 other two jobs may not "pay," I'm sure he'd be able to squeeze out about as
638 many perks as, say, Peter Jacobsen from his "charity" ventures.  So I'd
639 sure as hell resent the likes of a 3-Job Mr. Bob utilizing newly tried-and-
640 true Gulf tactics to guilt-trip a sleepwalking and already overburdened
641 dwindling middle class into voluntering to goose-step behind any new slo-
642 ganed sacrificial reform "programs."  Besides how can the middle class
643 support the post-war mass migrations back to the mauls, pay the ever-
644 growing expenses for the S&L scandal and weird weird war (how much WILL
645 it cost to provide life-long "support"/benefit increases for half a 
646 million veterans?), provide for AIDS research and education programs, plus
647 pad bank lending bases with huge new middle class savings accounts on
648 part-time pay with no benefits during a recession, no less ... when, in 
649 the real world, just the absence of a medical plan can put a whole family
650 on the streets ... or as with the Vietnam vets, through neglect, keep
651 them there?  And this while "the few" still rake in tax-free millions??
652  
653 But ALMOST more infuriating (and revealing) to me is that the APP con-
654 trived Portland's "spare the spare change law" to prevent handouts to
655 the homeless ... "for their own good," they say," "so that the undesir-
656 ables will utilize the more proper and effective (but often nonexistet)
657 social programs" -- an attitude recently condemned by the media nation-
658 wide and said to characterize the creeping callousness of our society.
659 Last summer some unfortunate kid downtown was stupid enough to scold me
660 for my indiscriminate law-breaking in this regard and I know he was sorry
661 he ever because I ranted relentlessly at him this whole long spiel asking
662 him, if he thought they were such damed righteous humanitarians, did he
663 know of ANY relief progams these business owners had backed with substan-
664 tial bucks of their own?  And if I'd had my displaced anger/floating
665 hostility together at the time, I'd have remembered about Michael Stoops
666 and really gotten hot, maybe even grabbing him by his stenciled t-shirt
667 & indignantly inquiring also if he'd ever stopped to wonder just who the
668 hell he thought was behind those obscene trumped-up charges against the
669 only selfless advocate the homeless ever had ... and who THEN proceeded
670 to harrass the poor guy completely out of town ... across the entire
671 nation as a matter of fact???
672  
673 But I think I did get as far as to relate to the genuinely terrorized
674 kid that, in my own miniscule peabrain, I had presumed the APP was
039=Usr:322 Stray Cat         03/21/91 07:30  Msg:5914 Call:33924 Lines:66
675 originally formed years ago when downtown businesses were in a slump be-
676 cause of parking problems, new suburban mauls, and what they most certainly
677 considered a growing rabble of undesirables taking over, and had worked
678 with a certan motormouthed mayor to remove the "Skid Row Blight" that had
679 previously provided cheap housing for said undesirables.  And if I'd re-
680 lated that, I probably also told him I was among a large group of temps
681 assigned to the OLCC to transcribe the hearings of those Skid Row businesses
682 who were being "ticketed" out of the area to make way for the 70s East Coast
683 immigrant contingent whose entrepreneurial Old Town project probably made
684 the every-euphoric Bill Naito a much wealthier man ... and further
685 because my roommate had worked with men who, on their days off, called Skid
686 Row home, I'd always presumed the project was a conspiracy to move Skid Row
687 over to Union Avenue for further ugly purposes I wouldn't care to go into
688 just then.  But one thing fersher ... the kid was definitely relived when
689 his bus finally pulled up.  I wonder, though, what the APP is planning to
690 tell young impressionable kids now since most "programs" for the poor have
691 now been cut due to Measure 5?
692  
693 But most likely snatches of other hearsay supposition have also factored
694 into my distorted perceptions and provoked this obnoxiously pre-
695 sumptuous and pretentions verbal attack ... like perhaps Uncle Ray's
696 total-loss pickle factory fire following a Scappoose zone change that
697 seriously impacted his previous growers, "forcing" him to rebuild in a
698 new industrial area, with federal aid and insurance (as if a banker in
699 the family wasn't help enough), much closer to town where his new-found
700 growers had the added convenience of enhanced transportation routes ...
701 just perxactly about the time Mr. Bob was at his post back on Capitol Hill
702 learning about such things.  If I remember correctly, brother-in-law Dale
703 "Gas Co." Johnson was also running for or held some local office and the
704 Sr. Mr. Ames was bank president (are banks family owned or what?).  But
705 lest you think me TOTALLY demented, a weird brochure distributed at
706 factory tours (actually stating they're strictly nepotistic and proud of
707 it) might tend to verify what might be considered terribly malicioius
708 allegations.
709  
710 And despite years of pious pillarship at a large downtown institution and
711 Coalition collaboration which been responsible for garnering such eminance
712 as having been, at one time, the only church in town with a neon sign AND a
713 pastor with white bucks and pink Cadillac but has recently become so 
714 fashionably progressive as to be "busing in Blacks" for Sunday services
715 among such other missionary mainstays as expending tax-deductible tithes
716 for sandwhich for undesirables on Thursday afternoons and distribution of
717 deductible donated discards to the Asian populatins, some ingrates persist
718 in whispered fidgets over such things as the Coalition firing of the
719 "unsightly" assistant pastor after a stoke left his face partially para-
720 lyzed ... or the Bull Mt. Missin incident where a lonely, elderly church
721 ]widow returning a deceptively packaged box of peachs (the bottom half was
722 rotten) was subjected to a lengthy shunning before finally being assisted
723 by the ever-smirking Mrs. Johnson and mom Elsie, then brutally directed 
724 never to darken their doors again ... or.... well, being the kind and
725 gentle person I am, and certainly no gossip, I won't go into the ones 
726 about the jr. Mr. Ray, even though I'm sure he'd be only too quick to
727 condemn me for any suspected minor indiscretions.
728  
729 And speaking of banker types, it's always seemed bizarre there was nary
730 a twinge about the young Mr. Hazen's spectacular deal on some valuable
731 NW property just about the time his Uncle Bob's S&L bit the dust.  In-
732 stead, a glitzy feature article in the Oregonian's NORTHWEST magazine
733 about his exclusive new restaurant on same property seemed to exhibit
734 the same smug aarrogance as the Steinfeld brochure.  But then maybe,
735 idiot that I am, it was just too tongue-in-cheek for me to catch the
736 drift ...

760 Something else that's bothered me for a long time is that if PFT field rep
761 Susan Larsen got her sexual harrassment suit against her last PPS employer &
762 if Randi Nolan Post is the most responsible for the Tubman firing (if I
763 remember correctly it was primarily due to a secretary's complaints), it
764 tends to throw some further ugly light on their attitudes and purposes.
765  
766  
767 I believe that firing happened shortly after some unpleasant board meetings

769 in which Don McElroy had made some rather crude comments about the district's
770 secretaries ... and about the time McElroy was finally muzzled from the
771 public but allowed to continue with his tactics and the administration
772 started courting the unions, allowing healthy wage increases while formulating
043=Usr:322 Stray Cat         03/22/91 06:37  Msg:5918 Call:33948 Lines:10
773 oppressive control through weakly bargained "agreements" full of loopholes
774 "stacked" against employees.  And as it ended up, administrators "going 
775 against the grain" could be dealt with through weird classified union suits
776 through almost blackmail tactics, with added support from various administra-
777 tive level gangsters, like DOIs.
778  
779 For a long time I'd thought Randi ran for PFT president because she didn't
780 like what she saw go on in the Personnel Office when she worked there, but
781 have since figured out there were different reasons.

839 ------------------------------- A stitch in time -------------------------
840  
841 EVEN THOUGH Randi Nalon Posts had always rather publicly maintained she'd
842 solicited the PFT Presidency because of inquities suffered in the PPS
843 Personnel Department (a perspective that also provided a handy "excuse"
844 in countless explanations of the continuous cycle of unbelievably costly
845 Classifications, Reclassifications, Re-Evaluations of Reclassisfications,
846 and Re-Evaluation of Re-Evaluations I/II results)
847  
848 ... and EVEN THOUGH she did often appear to be cutting Don McElroy down to
849 size (the HEAVY of the Blanchard Administration and part of the management
850 team that came with him) after he made some well-publicized crude and
851 disparaging remarks about the PPS classified staff at some "contract-time"
852 public Board meetings (the Pre-Cozy Period)
853  
854 ... and EVEN THOUGH I hadn't been particularly impressed with earlier
855 efforts of PFT-CE on behalf of its members (the 1987-90 Agrement for
856 Classified Employees wuld make for a good study of district operational
857 philosophy but is also interesting reading in its own right .. especially
858 in hindsight .. and to think we paid good extortion money for this.  Fellow
859 Sleepwalkers beware!)
860  
861 ... I didn't become REALLY uncomfortable with union attitudes until one
862 Susan Larsen came bouncing into our staff lounge one noon some time back,
863 announcing herself as the new PFT field rep and stating the reason for her
864 over-excitement at the time was the sexual harrassment settlement Randi had
865 just "won her."  I was so mortified I left the room ...
866  
867 ... and EVEN THOUGH I, myself, had always despised that assinine and imma-
868 ture "double entendred" banter and, even worse, the many variations of the
869 "office wife" and "company-time coziness" routines so often THE "behind the
870 screens ... er scenes" cause for such suits ...
871  
872 but somehow it instantly stuck me this kind of trendy chickenpoop harrass-
873 ment claim seemed totally INAPPROPRIATE for a school district
874  
875 ... ESPECIALLY when there might be a chance "harrassment" could get twisted
876 to "abuse" and eventually spread like cacer through the schools ... and
877 ESPECIALLY when these types of claims could also tend to pesent a greater
878 risk for the already too few men in teaching positions
879  
880 Besides, I thought, these kinds of issues could and SHOULD be very easily
881 handled by alert, up-to-date, efficient and properly-trained supervisors.
882  
883 And since a FORMER head secretary (and, more telling, ALSO the building
884 union rep) and her childhood buddy, who worked in close quarters just down
885 the hall, not only encouraged that kind of boring and embarrassingly child-
886 ish reparte but had also schemed teir way to prominance through various
887 and sundry assorts of those very aforementioned office games (among other
888 things ... including blackmail) ...
889  
890 ... and SINCE the department also had some male employees notorious district-
891 wide for this kind of @#()$^ behavior (Susan had rather frequent contact with
892 one of them at her pre-Union job where she had worked and done battle with
893 our NEW head secretary) anyway
894  
895 ... nothing had been done about either embarrassing situation.  So I took
896 The Law Into My Own Hands and chanced an attempted witticism regarding the
897 situation.  Not only was I rebuked with a secret negative letter to my
898 "second," hidden personnel file in the Employee Relations Dept., but a
899 rather crude note regarding my smoking habits was posted on the staff lounge
900 door stating "PLEASE KEEP YOUR BUTTS OUT OF THE TOILET."
901  
902 So I'd just kinda figured these kinds of suits were probably not only 
903 chickenpoop but were undoubtedly exercised quite inequitable as well.  And
904 this proved to be correct not long afterward when the "childhood buddy" 
905 received a trumped up sexual harrassment settlementof her own, after which
906 she transferred to a position that allowed her to work with the aforemen-
907 tioned FORMER head secretary/childhood buddy once again.
908  
909 But in spite of that, and EVEN THOUGH fragments of two other incidents had
910 been festering in the back of my mind and had nagged me as being "separate"
911 issues for a long time, the connection hadn't "hit" me until some time a 
912 week or two ago, and that is
913  
914 ... if Susan's sexual harrassment suit was filed against her last PPS
915 employer and IF Randi's solicitations at Tubman wre a major factor in
916 that aincident, then all this nonsense is not JUT alot of irritating and
917 time-consuming superficial chickenpoop shenanigans "between friends"
918  
919 ... or not even JUST the ego-tripping, trickle-down terrorist tactics that
920 had always frightened me -- like the firings of the unfit, abuse of misfits,
921 or the union/administration, administration/administration, administration/
922 board, board/union or administration/board/union coziness/infighting,
923 whichever ...
924  
925 No.  Now I think maybe some more downright diry and deep down UGLY might
926 be behind district malaise as well ... something even worse than distance
927 an detachment, nepotism and arrogance ...
928  
929 ... possibly even that very something Dr. Prophet may have suggested to
930 Bill Graves might be more of an attitude problem of those wo hadn't yet
931 pulled themselve up by their own bootstraps and then commenced to ignore
932 all signs to contrary 
933  
934 ... an "attitude" which should not persist (and perhaps will not be 
935 tolerated) in the 1990s, ESPECIALLY in the land of PPS where the oppor-
936 tunities are endless and the money is good
937  
938 ... which is, of course, exactly what most everybody would prefer to 
939 believe -- ESPECIALLY Bill Gates, right?  <grin!>
940  
941 But how could it be?  How COULD people believe it, I ask myslf, EVEN
942 AFTER PF had gone to all the trouble of setting us all straight with 
943 his trite tongue-lashing to the contrary jut last fall, right before
944 OPB's airing of a "close friend's" documentary about the disgraceful
945 prevalance of this very thing right HERE ... RIGHT HERE IN STUMPTOWN
946 USA, and not very long age??
947  
948 But then, perhaps because we never saw any followup columns or feedback
949 on current and prevailing problems -- such as the BUF boycott, the
950 Baseline essays, or the educational plans written by a variety of N/NE
951 concerns and endorse by an impressive number of advocates but then
952 rudely and blatently ignored by the District and Board ... not eve the
953 rather eventful School Board elections -- I suppose we might make the
954 assumptions about PF and his "insider" Radically Liberal Friends that:
955  
956 1) they may consider local issues mundane, irrelevant, unimportant or
957 unfashionable
958  
959 2) they may consider "garden party" charities more momentous than abiding
960 interest in the issues
961  
962 3)  they may prefer to deal only with issues that promote their own self-
963 interests or enhance their own self-images
964  
965 4)  they may merely pay lipservice to issues/ideals
966  
967 5)  they may actually deem rights and such civilities as respect, esteem
968 and dignity passe or mere relics of the past ... GONE

971 the Germand or Japanese

974  
975 ... with hundreds of thousands of "third-rate" Third World "Uppity" Iraquis
976 and the Nation Called Iraq
977

982 Charity Conscription, featuring not only a tax deduction but a 3-day
983 employer-paid leave?  Could you imagine some poor civil servant having to
984 drag that dolt along on a 3-day prepaid tax-deductible joyride into the
985 wilds??  Is there no end???
