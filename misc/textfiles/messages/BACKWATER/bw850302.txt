21 I too was at the clackamas college computer testing.  My teem of three
22 made it to the finals (how, I'll never know) and I'm not sure how we did
23 in there.  After the computer was deleting every line past 110 we moved
24 to another one, the one that made that horrible sound when turned on.
25 Well, I typed in the programs that would take us to the stars, if they
26 worked!  
27 Who else was there braving all odds to get the programs in before the
28 buzzer?  Before all the extra points ran out?  Who knows, I might have saw

33 It looked like some sort of quest was about to begin. The Wizard uttered a

51    Then in the morning, the young Master West awoke to find that he was left 
52 behind.  This did not bother him greatly for he knew that once he had made
53 contact with the one he had sought out, things would return to some semblence
54 of normality in due time.  The few hours spent with the piper in discussion
55 the night before had unlocked a few doors for the boy and had pointed him in
56 a direction he found suitable.  Another thing he noticed was the pipers habit
57 of fidgiting with the sleek figurine every once in awhile- distracted but 
58 never sidetracked.  As the boy stood and shook off the sleep from his limbs,
59 he noticed that the Innkeeper had already risen and was busy with preparing for
60 the coming day. Tables were cleaned and straitened, glasses were polished
61 and stacked in appropriate order, and a steaming mug of hot cider was to be
62 found beside the boys place of rest.  He was deeply touched at the strangers
63 display of interest.  "If only I could tell him how much *I* appreciate 
64 the ability to have visited," was his thought.  There would be a way...
65 (bells in the night!?!    sorry.)

182 Regor became aware of someone addressing him from the other side of the 
183 Inn.  As he sat at the table with his back to the wall, he measured
184 the tension in the room.  As the noise level of the Inn dropped Regor
185 took his hand off the mug of Ale before him and felt in control of the
186 situation.  His assurance was born of the results of past encounters as
187 well as the vague shape he felt in his left armpit.  Their eyes locked
188 for a full count of ten.  The noise level rose to normal as Regor's 
189 antagonist chose to wait for an opponent easier to intimidate.  The
190 Innkeeper brought Regor another Ale.  He slowly finished his drink
191 then went outside into the night.  He retrieved his pack from under 
192 some leaves and placed it on his shoulders.  He stared at the warm glow
193 coming from the Inn and wondered if the regulars would welcome his return
194 or rather he left them alone.  The decision was made to return if his 
195 mission would allow it.  Regor turned and walked into the night.

221         "Quiet!", whispered L'homme. "Company is coming, and I think it is
222 four-wheel drive company..."
223         The group of former and current NET agents, huddled in the mountain
224 cabin, then heard the shouts of men, and the sounds of not one, but many
225 vehicles coming up the twisty snow covered road. L'homme and Fellows,
226 weapons drawn, took up positions behind the front windows. Farley trained
227 Betsy in Kosta's general direction, to ensure any ideas of escape remained
228 ideas, and Gaudy Minsky, now armed with her own Walther PPK 7.65mm, courtesy
229 of L'homme, watched the rear.
230         "I don't think these guys have come asking for direction to Meadows.",
231 quipped Fellows.
232         "Always with the jokes. Someday you may find your humor out of place.",
233 growled L'homme.
234         #No sense of humor any more,# pondered Fellows, while keeping a look-
235 out towards the front. Men were deploying all around the cabin. One man seemed
236 to be doing most of the directing. Now aloud, Fellows whispered to L'homme, "
237 You recognize the man in charge, don't you?"
238         L'homme had recognized him all right. Flemming! #What is he doing
239 here? And what's with all the artillery?# "I think he has gone off the deep
240 end. Gaudy, come over here. Your old friend Flemming has come to pay a visit."
241         Before Gaudy Minsky could get to the other room, an amplified voice
242 boomed, "Gaudy Minsky! I know you are in there. Come out with your hands up
243 and you guns down. There is no escape. I traced your car here. L'homme can't
244 help you this time. You'll never disobey a NET order again. Come out now and
245 I'll be easy on you!"
246         Fellows peeked over the window sill, and was greeted by a volley of
247 automated small arms fire turning the area around the window into splinters.
248 "Gaudy, you sure have a way of making friends and influencing people, don't
249 you?", he said to the now crouching NET agent.
250         L'homme motioned Gaudy back. "NET procedure for such a situation is
251 absolute quiet. If we keep the enemy from knowing our exact positions and
252 numbers inside the building, we minimize their chances of getting in a lucky
253 shot. We can assume Flemming has gone completely mad, pursuing some perverse
254 personal vendetta against Minsky. He doesn't know the rest of us are here,
255 since we all came in Gaudy's old car."
256         "And a tight fit it was, even with the rest of Fred's parts in the
257 trunk." Farley interjected.
258         "OK, Minsky! Have it your way!" Flemming's voice was even more
259 malevolent thanks to the megaphone. "Let's see how you like cooked Fiat!"
260 An explosion rocked the cabin, and all of its inhabitants. The reactions
261 told the sad story.
262         "My car!!!", sobbed Gaudy.
263         "Fred!", yelled Farley.
264         "Our escape.", said L'homme.
265         "There is no way down this mountain.", returned Fellows.
266         "What's a NET agent to do?", said Kosta, apparently not realizing the
267 jeopardy of the situation.
268         "Need I say more?", taunted the voice outside. "My men could simply
269 rush your little hideout, and kill you, but I want that pleasure for myself.
270 I don't mind waiting to see your pretty face Gaudy. I can wait out here as
271 long as you can wait in there. Longer actually." And then he laughed. A laugh
272 of such nefarious and loathsome tones that even the trained agents within
273 the cabin could not deny its chilling effects.
274         Minutes passed, and it began to snow again. L'homme, Farley, Minsky,
275 and Fellows worked quickly and silently, using their NET training to fortify
276 their position. Farley broke the silence. "How could this happen? "How could a
277 NET agent as good as Flemming turn bad?"
278         "Perhaps I can answer that." It was Kosta, who was still bound at the
279 wrists and ankles. "But first you must untie me. These NET knots are getting
280 rather uncomfortable. Besides, I know how we can get out of here."
281         L'homme's response contained the appropriate amount of skepticism.
282 "Sure Kosta. The Enterprise should be in position any second now. All we have
283 to do is give Scotty the word, and..."
284         "I admire your brevity in the face of such odds, but I kid you not.
285 Listen to me, and we'll all get out of this alive. But first, these knots!"

296 Like they say Mig, a good defense is a strong offense. I always knew
297 I couldn't fool the all powerful man of pink cards. Who am I to be so
298 bold in my assumptions? I don't quite know what your problem is, but
299 I have my suspicions. Too bad really. Since you seem to know so much
300 about what I have and have not taken in school, perhaps you can also
301 warn me in the future when I use material from other classes you have
302 taken. Far be it from me to attempt to recycle old notes. Tsk Tsk!
303 As for being caustic; that remains in the eye of the beholder. Perhaps
304 a little oversensitivity is the problem here. When one looks for 
305 conflicts, big or small, one is rarely disapointed. I would suggest
306 dropping the whole thing, BW doesn't seem the place for such
307 carrying-ons.
308 The Jiz: Your comments are interesting. An important point is that
309 analyzing a film should never come in the way of enjoying it. While
310 editing is an important aspect of any film, a poor job, or even a
311 'noticeable' job would not entirely ruin a film for me, when there is
312 so much else that is happening. Being not totally unfamiliar with the
313 problems that arise after the actors go home and the actual filming
314 is done; pressures from the front office and such, I can see how
315 such things may end up being rushed. Sometimes there is simply not
316 time or budget to do a perfect job. But when the editing is smooth,
317 what a joy!

321 Ada: Do you mind if I give that information to L'homme to be relayed to you?
322 Poll: Gee, were you in that tiny room (217)?  I was the tall, dark haired guy in glasses at the left front table.  My
323 partner was the loud one with the strange sense of humor (he puts the END statement in line 666).

325 "Fred," I moaned.  No telling how that explosion twisted the myriad of Fred's parts in the trunk.
326 "...just untie these ropes, and I'll show you a way out of here," someone was saying.  Kosta.  L'homme was standing
327 over him with a now-tell-me-another-fairy-tale-before-i-go-to-bed look on his face.  Fellows and Gaudy were low to the
328 wall, intently listening to the sounds outside.
329 "For the second time, Kosta, I don't believe you," L'homme said.
330 "Wait, L'homme.  Kosta, why would YOU know of any way out of here?", I asked.
331 "I've visted a few of the lesser-used hideouts, and, how shall I say it, modified them."
332 "Give us a bit of knowledge that will prove you're not lying."
333 "Esteves, find the basement trap-door.  There's a padlock on it, there wasn't before.  The combination is 23-19-24.
334 In the basement, there is a subterranean tunnel that goes 50 yards down the mountain.  It was used as a jumping-off
335 point for skiing.  There's six sets of skis in the basement."
336 "Are you saying that we should use the tunnel and ski down this mountain?"
337 "Exactly.  Now untie me."
338 "Why should we?  We can guide you down."
339 "Well, there are two reasons.  One, there's a combination lock on the outer door of the tunnel, too- on the inside.
340 Two, the way down the mountain is, well, difficult.  Several hazards hinder progress down the mountain until the next
341 cabin.  Trees, large rocks, the slope itself..."
342 Fellows and Gaudy had been listening in by now, and their faces reflected sheer disbelief.  Not in Kosta, however.
343 
344 L'homme seemed to be believing him.
345 
346 "Forget it, L'homme.  I'm not skiing down this pile of rock.  Especially when there's rocks and trees in the way that

348 "Count me out, too, L'homme.  Flying into a tree isn't my idea of a good time," Fellows said.
349 "That goes double for me.  I don't mind the rough route so much as the bullets that will follow us down," I said.
350 "All right, any other ideas?" L'homme asked us.
351 Just then, someone did come up with an idea.
352 "All right, Gaudy!" Flemming yelled.  "I'm giving you just 5 minutes and then we're going to break in!"
353 "He sounds like a bad western," Fellows quipped.

356     Flemming quipped a while back inside the cabin, before he made his nifty
357 suprise party a twisted reality of sorts.  How did he do that?  It would help
358 me well on my road to gneneral and overall divinity.

388 
389                        Freud sat with pen in hand
390                        His clipboard neatly lined
391                        And peeled back his cranium
392                        To see what he would find
393               
394                        He checked the cracks and creases
395                        He looked for quite some time
396                        Then he grabbed a putty knife
397                        And scraped off all the slime
398 
399                        He put it on a tabletop
400                        And watched it roll around
401                        Then he called his friends up 
402                        To show them what he'd found
403 
404                        This is my discovery
405                        I think I'll call it Id
406                        I'll bet Gestalt is furious
407                        I found it 'fore he did
408                       
409                        So forget your split-brain theory
410                        Group therapy and your EST
411                        When it comes to psychotherapy
412                        It's Freud this I like best
413 
414                        But I haven't told the best part
415                        The part that I like most
416                        The reason that I hold so dear
417                        Ol' Freud's departed ghost
418            
419                        You see, after all his friends had gone
420                        He set aside his pen
421                        Then he took his putty knife
422                        And put it all back in

427     CONSERVATION OF BOREDOM!!!!!
428 
       Since the dawn of time there has been a conservation of 
429 
       boredom.
430 
     First there was primordial soup, and it was good---but after several
431 
        billion years and unsuccessful parcheesi (?) games, it was
432 
        boring.
433 
     Then there was the dinosaur, and things pycked up a bit---but after
434 
        a long and unfruitful food chain, they gave it up and much of
435 
        their bordom became irrecoverable, compressed into crude oil
436 
        along with them.
437 
     Then there was the cave man, and the invention of kinky sex really
438 
        warmed the caves--- but bordom caught up and sex was legalized
439 
        and institutionalized.
440 
     Now we stand on the threshold of yet another bordom plateau. Earth
441 
        itself has become an object of our bordom. It has been explioted
442 
        and raped in every way possible and there is just nothing left
443 
        to do. The last hope we have left to relieve bordom is nuke the
444 
	baby---but can even genetic mutation rid us of the conservation
445 
        of bordom?????
446 
                                                    ROZ.

460 Regor swung further east than needed on his journey to the Garthian 
461 settlement.  Avoiding trails he traveled cross-country until he was 
462 overlooking the reason for the detour.  The sun had set four long hours 
463 ago and below him the warm glow of the Inn invited him to return.  Regor
464 waited several minutes watching the Inn and waiting for that feeling that
465 always came to warn or reassure Regor about upcoming situations.  Stashing
466 his pack in some bushes Regor approached the Inn with caution.  Upon 
467 entering Regor scanned the room and went to a corner table where he sat 
468 his back to the wall.  Several faces seemed to have been here during an
469 earlier visit.  A few, like himself, seemed to be outsiders who were here
470 for reasons of their own.  The Innkeeper caught his eye and raised a glass
471 of Ale.  Regor smiled and nodded yes.  The Ale came and the Innkeeper left
472 leaving Regor to his thoughts.  No one seemed to notice when Regor left.
473 Shouldering his pack Regor watched the Inn for several minutes then 
474 continued the journey to the settlement.

479 oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
480 Roz:  Threshold of a boredom plateau?  Earth itself the object of boredom?  You
481 are absolutely right; that's how it usually looks to a species that's aready to
482 expand into a larger environment, yet whose vision is as yet too narrow to
483 perceive that its range is NOT limited to a single planet.  I do not criticize
484 you personally for this attitude, since it pervades Earth's culture.  It is in
485 fact a major indication that a new plateau has been reached (as is the
486 unfortunate notion that to nuke the planet will be the ultimate way out). 
487 Boredom has a place in the scheme of things; it serves to prod cultures into
488 efforts they might not otherwise be motivated to make.  There's a whole universe
489 out there to explore, and species busy exploring it don't have to let off steam
490 by nuking worlds; they've got more constructive outlets.  But it's sad to see
491 how many people hereabouts really do believe that there's "just nothing left to
492 do".  Wake up, Earthlings!  Do you really suppose that one small world orbiting
493 one small sun is all that exists to occupy your attention?

496  I'm Jay Anderson. Whoever is using my name here (which thank god has been 
497 deleted) and other systems, please stop. Sure, I'm rude ocasionally, but I'm
498 not that rude! I'm no demon and I'm no assassin either. I don't want my name
499 curtailed to your stupid insults. Please stop, is all I can say. I really
500 don't care what you say about other people, but don't use my name.  It seems
501 I've got people who decided that they want to be me. But, come on! That isn't
502 very nice, you've probabley made a bunch of people out there hate me. That 
503 was the idea? 
504  Tanya, Allow me to apologize for any offence I or any of my imposters may 
505 have caused you here and on other systems as well.
506  Spectral One, Like I said: I don't care who you're going to critize, just
507 don't use my name, the one you had chosen seemed fine to me. 
508  If this continues, I'm likely to become an assassin!               Sorry.

515 Roz. --- A thoughroughly enjoyable thought (except for the extra LF's), but,
516 come now, do you really think that death would relieve our eternal boredome,
517 or was that just sarcasm? Anyhow, the world is a pretty boring place. That is
518 why Backwater was created: to provide a place to creatively and intelligently
519 reelieve the boredom of at least the small modem-owning segment of society. 
520 Perhaps if all the world owned modems, we wouldn't need to worry about 
521 nuclear war? Crime? Kinky sex?
522 
523 Film Fan--- Yes, you are right about that one. Technical quality is, for me,
524 always a second consideration when reporting on a film; entertainment level
525 always comes first. Take the recent "epic" Dune for example. I really 
526 loved the film, but a few of the technicians must have been on quaaludes
527 when working or something. I meanthis one
528 had pretty choppy editing, and directing could have been better (Lynch
529 did far better with The Elephant Man), but when my friends asked me how I
530 liked the flick, I gave it raves. Just goes to show what the REAL purpose
531 of films are in our society. Take that, Gene Siskal!!!

556 Mikey! Good news! Results are in. PCjr: 2.4 and 2.6 mhz. Also, and this was
557  a bit of a surprise, COPYLINK worked with the COM2: version. COM1: was dead.
558  I dialed, got a bunch of busy signals, downloaded some stuff (finally), and
559  everything ran fine. COPYLINK is really nice! The more I use it the better
560  I like it. As a diehard CROSSTALK then PROYAM fan, I though no other term
561  program could wrangle a way into my modeming heart, but COPYLINK has. If you
562  have room for beta-testers on Version 3.0, I would be happy to accomodate. If
563  you already have a network of designated testers, I understand. You'll get

570    Using boredom as a motive for desrtoying our lovely home (as of yet, Earth is
571 not only Room Enough, it's all we've got). Well, I suppose it's better than 
572 doing it out of disgust or, as I have wanted to do, out of a desire to see how 
573 far you can push. I was younger and more in love with my intellect then, I had 
574 mistaken coldness for empiricism. But I digress.
575  I don't think it's out of boredom that we are pacticing how to make things go 
576 Boom, and BOOM, and boom. I think, rather, that we're curious. Mankind has been 
577 given a marvy, neato-keen, chemestry set with no rules (don't you hate social
578 metaphores?). Being young and precocious, we are trying to figure out the rules 
579 for ourselves, mostly by breaking them, but were're learning. If we were bored, 
580 we'd have started playing with a new toy by now, like that model spaceship in 
581 the corner. 
582  And about sex being boring. I understand that all of you are YEARS older than 
583 me, but I don't think it's become "Just not what it used to be, my dear.". Not 
584 quite.
585  Oh, I've decided that you folks are stuck with me and my opinions. I've tried 
586 using other names, but I get the same response. So, I'm just going to have to
