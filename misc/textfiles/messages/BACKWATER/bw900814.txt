 66 Once upon a time there was a little engine, whose name was Sam.  Sam was
 67 born in 1967, and has many happy memories of his childhood.  Sam can
 68 remember drinking crystal clear gasoline, with a nice lead flavoring,
 69 and on special weekends he can even remember drinking Premium!
 70   The years were not kind to Sam, however.  When he was about 6 years old,
 71 he pulled into a station aand got his first taste of Gasohol.  Yeach!
 72 He spent the next year coughing and sputtering on the putrid excuse for
 73 gasoline that every other engine had to endure.  Eventually, the gasoline
 74 finally cleared up and he began breathing easier.  Things seemed different,
 75 though.  Either he was getting older, or something was contaminating his
 76 fuel, because he just couldn't seem to make the power he used to be able
 77 to make, and occasionally he got a severe case of the shutters.
 78   One fine day when he was 12 years old, he was out driving and something
 79 very bad happened.  He ran into an old friend.  Hard.  When Sam woke up
 80 he was in very unfamiliar surroundings.  He looked around and he couldn't
 81 see anything he recognized.  Junk was piled everywhere.  He cried a little,
 82 he missed his old home.
 83   Sam sat where he was for the next 5 years.  Dust covered him.  Occasionally,
 84 he got poked and prodded but nobody moved him.  Finally, one day he felt
 85 himself being lifted up and put in the back of a truck.
 86   Sam had never had anything like this happen to him.  He felt himself 
 87 coming apart, and he got shoved into a very hot, wet, tank for a very
 88 long time.  He was cut and scraped and pounded on and people stuck funny
 89 things into his orfices.  When it was all over, he felt himself being
 90 put back together, and gently lifted and placed in a brand new home.
 91   Sam felt great!  He felt even better than when he was new, and he couldn't
 92 wait to get out on the streets and taste some gas!
 93   Sam had a suprise coming for him, though.  It happened when he rolled
 94 out into the street and turned over for the first time in 6 years.
 95   YYYYEEEAAACCCHHH!!!!  You call this gas!!!! he thought to himself.
 96 This was the weakest piswater he had ever tasted!   Even Gasohol had not
 97 been this bad!  Sam looked over at the station pump.  Premium, it said.
 98 PREMIUM!  Premium was supposto be great, not garbage!  Geesh, thought
 99 Sam, you mean I have to drink this garbage for the next 10 years!
100   
101 Now, someone tells Sam that he can't have any more gas because of an Iraq.
102 Sam is not sad.  Would you be?

119 Zephyr, it uld greatly help if you could possibly mention a name.  I have
120 used the plus border several times before on this board - although never
121 using the handle 'Ariel' before, and it would be interesting if you were
122 actually referring to one of my earlier entries.
123 As a matter of fact, the inspiration for the name stemmed from a quick look
124 around my room and laying my eyes on the television antenna sticking up.

132 Since I doubt you and Milch are one in  the same, and since Milch doesn't seem

464  
465 Well, it's 6:45 pm and I've just finished listening to the President's
466 speech to congress, and it is interesting to note the shallowness of the
467 TV commentators so called `analysis' of the speech.
468 I really think that the big question here is the same as the question little
469 kids play iin the game `I dare you'.
470 Saddam Hussein is really only interested in the answer to one question; Will
471 the United States invade Kuwait?  The facts are that he has ALREADY annexed
472 Kuwait,
473 he ALREADY has control of what he wants, and as long as he stays put he will
474 continue to retain that control.  There has never in history been a case where
475 a boycott has ever forced any country to do anything, and the mere thought that
476 our current boycott will force him to do anything is, to me, plainly foolish.
477 The current boycott really only serves one purpose; to prevent the importation
478 of weapons, and to stop the continuing buildup and refinement of Iraq's army.
479 If the president goes on national TV and says the quarrel is not with the
480 people of Iraq, then how will he justify boycotts of food to those people?
481 No, the President's real fear is that by allowing trade with Iraq there will
482 be continued support of the army in the form of supplies, spare parts, new
483 weapons, etc.
484      In any case, Iraq is in possession of the Kuwait, and will retain that
485 possession unless forced out.  Hussein will never leave voluntarily, and why
486 should he?  Even if no country ever buys oil from him again, he will not lose
487 by staying.  As long as there is oil in Kuwait and Iraq, he will have a
488 commodity that the world wants, and if one day all the worlds oil runs out,
489 the world will have little choice but to come to him.  Anyway, there is
490 always going to be somebody who will buy oil from him, maybe not now, but
491 in the future.  Even the promise of one day selling oil to the world will
492 be worth more than the advantages of leaving.
493       Hussein knows that if the United States relly wants him to get out they
494 will have no choice but to invade and fight a war.  If fact, the longer the
495 U.S. does NOT invade, the less likely it is that they will, and the more
496 legitimate the occupation will be.  So, the question he really wants to know,
497 is will President Bush really do it? Will he really fight?  In fact, it is
498 imperative that Bush make it seem as though he will, even if he has no
499 intention of doing so.
500        Much of what I saw tonight has that showmanship to it.  It is known
501 in advance that Bush will threaten.  The difficulty lies in guessing if
502 Bush will really fight.
503        One other thing that I saw tonight that really makes me happy is that
504 apparently Bush has learned from history about hostages.
505 How many people here know what Israels policy is on taking hostages?  The
506 goverment of Israel considers a hostage as already dead.  Israel will only
507 permit a hostage taker one way out: unconditional surrender.  If this is
508 not forthcoming Israeli police will not hesitate to shoot the hostage in
509 the process of killing the hostage taker.  As a result, Israel has very
510 few of it's citizens taken hostage.
511          Not two long ago, the U.S. had approx 200 of it's citizens taken
512 hostage in the American embassy in Iran.  This country foolishly bargained
513 and negotiated for a YEAR to get them back, when it should have mounted a
514 concerted attack on the embassy after the first six hours of captivity.
515 Yes, it would have been hard, espically since many if not all of the hostages
516 had been killed, but a sucessful attack would have also killed the hostage
517 takers and destroyed Iran's barganing power.  It might have also weakened
518 Iran enough so that it would not have lasted the Iran/Iraq war, or put it more
519 pro America.  Indeed it was those original hostages that provided a rallying
520 point for the people of Iran to develop such anti-americanism.
521         I was one of those people who at the time hated the U.S.  policy
522 to the Iran hostages.  I remember hoping they would die so the country would
523 stop it's useless moralizing and focus it's attention elsewhere.
524          Now, Iraq has 3000 of our citizens held hostage.  Part of the reason
525 that they even are still holding them is the lesson we taught the world over
526 10 years ago, namely that the U.S. is willing to negotiate with hostage takers.
527 When the U.S. is forced to invade, as it almost surely will have to, many of
528 those 3000 people will die, many many more than 200.  In essence, we bought
529 those 200 lives long ago with the many lives of those hostages that are
530 currently in Kuwait and Iraq and will almost certainly die.  I hope every
531 one of you out there who were supportive of President Carter's policys back
532 then to think about this.  Look to see a war in the next few months. I do.

543               One begins to wonder, after repeated assaults on the
544          psyche, crude insults to the intellect and bleating appeals
545  {       to perceived emotions.....will these bastards stop at
546          nothing?  I'm talking about ADVERTISERS, of course, the sleek
547          young men and women who are the heart, lungs, and cerebral
548          cortex of the media, where so many of us languish for so many
549          hours and then slip into bed wondering "Huh? What was that
550          again?"
551  
552               My latest rude shock was a radio commercial, and not
553          even a fast-talking hard-sell commercial either. It was one
554        { of those One-to-One jobs...a newly introspective young man
555          speaking in hushed, confessional tones from the back of an
556          ambulance. He had been in an auto accident, apparently, and
557          though he felt certain he was OK, he was nevertheless being
558          rushed to a hospital, and the experience had put him in a
559          reflective mood. After a few moments of allowing the listener
560          to wonder if the commercial is for Disk Brakes...
561          Insurance...maybe some new kind of user friendly Medical
562 {         Center or Ambulance Service....he s{arts talking about his
563          mother. And underwear.  Yup. Underwear. It was a radio
564          commercial for Hanes Underwear. You know..."Mom always told
565          me something like this would happen someday, and when it did,
566          I'm sure glad to be wearing clean Hane's Underwear...."
567  
568               In a nearly related item...there's this business of
569          LABELING FAT CONTENT in food items available at your favorite
570          supermarket. One afternoon, like a righteous apparition from
571          the Consumer Pastry Heaven, there appeared in my kitchen a
572          package of Keebler cookies... little crunchy guys, with an
573          interior glob of gooey chocolate in a chemically altered,
574          permanently melted state. These little suckers were great,
575          and I ate about six of them before I began to have doubts
576          about that little notice right there on the package
577          proclaiming this snack was a "No Cholesterol, Low In
578          Saturated Fat" variety of off the shelf mass-consumer snack
579          food item. Something just seemed not quite right, so I began
580          to look into some of the math on the label. Well, hell, this
581          ain't too bad...only 5 grams of fat per serving. Let's see
582          how many Gooey Cookies they consider "One Serving". You can
583          see where this is going. Yup. One Serving = One Cookie. These
584     {    things are about the size of a silver dollar. One Cookie is
585          only enough to make you think six or nine more might be nice.
586          Seven cookies and a glass of milk weighs in at approximately
587          40 to 45 grams of fat. Be sure to stare at the bright and
588          colorful "No Cholesterol" label while you snack...I'm
589                              convinced that helps.

717 Nice, but would you please write a short essay that explains exactly how the
718 pieces you quoted relate to the current crissis in the gulf?  Also, I've always
719 wondered why people are perfectly willing to believe the worst about the 
720 country they live in, while believing the best about a country they don't live
721 in.  They again, politics and logic have seldom been known to couple.  And
722 its a good thing to.  Can you imagine what the offspring would look like?

733               If you honestly cannot see any relation between the
734          pieces I quoted and Desert Shield, then "a short essay" from
735          me won't help you.
736               I'm curious how you got from them the idea that I am
737          "perfectly willing to believe the worst" about America, while
738          "believing the best about a country I don't live in." I don't
739          know about you, but I have lived in a foreign country, for
740          many years, and when I said "God Bless America" I wasn't just
741          jerking your chain. I love this country. I am a patriot, and
742          I constantly search for reasons to remain one. That's what
743          being an American is all about...not Nationalism, not Dogma
744          or Jingoism or "My Country Right or Wrong." Free choice. Free
745          thought. The freedom to express doubts and ask questions.
746               Questions like : Are we there to keep the world safe for
747          oil rich monarchies? Are we there to keep oil at around $20 a
748          barrel? Are we there to protect Europe and Japan's oil
749          supplies, and if so, doesn't that make us mercenaries? Are we
750          there because, as a nation, we are used to fighting and can't
751          imagine any other approach to the world's complexities? If
752          American men and women begin coming home in plastic bags, I
753          won't be the only one asking these questions. Maybe you
754          should be asking George Bush for a short "exact" essay, not
755          me.
756               If I run a quote and some lyrics up the ol' Backwater
757          flagpole, its not out of love for Saddam Hussein. In the
758          America I love, quotes, lyrics, hopes, fears, questions,
759          ideas and doubts can be expressed freely, with the hope of
760          stimulating more of the same, and without fear of being
761          labelled Anti-American.

773 No prob ThingFish.  My attitude is much the same as your own.  My comments
774 were made in the hope they would elicit a somewhat more detailed post from
775 you.  
776  
777 I would note that we seem to see Iraq in a somewhat different light.  Oil 
778 is certainly a factor, but to me the most important reason we are there is
779 to get rid of husain, a man who is ruthless, competent and very ambitious.  
780 And will have nuclear weapons within the next ten years, if he doesn't
781 have them already.
782  
783 This year it was kuwait, next year it would have been saudi arabia, the year a
784 after that who knows?  
785  
786 Also, we tried to stay out of world war 1, and world war 2 because of our
787 isolationist tendancies.  And look what it got us in the end.

793 I think the Gulf problem is that Hussein is literaly an insane person.  He
794 just doesn't think like a normal individual.  I would imagine his thought
795 processes are completely shortcircuited.  I think that whatever images of the
796 rest of the world he carries around are completely unrelated to the real world.
797 I have a feeling that he thinks that his country is completely invincible, and
798 if there is a war he will continue fighting until every last soldier in Kuwait
799 is either killed or captured.  Most people in this country, espically 
800 newspaper columnists, are trying to analyse the confilict in sane terms and
801 are failing because there is just nothing to gain from the invasion, and
802 this does not jive with logic or even politics.  I think that if we look at 
803 it from Husseins view, and understand that his view is just completely wrong,
804 that we will make sense of it.

810               True, Ariel, true. But it might serve us well to
811          remember that Adolf Hitler was pretty well full tilt insane
812          too, and that knowledge didn't make him go away, make the
813          Nazis stop fighting for him, or give us the secret to
814          conquering him easily. Crazy or not, Hitler knew what he was
815 {         trying to do, and came close to doing it. Too close.
816               There are a lot of people in the Mideast who don't
817          assume Saddam Hussein is a lunatic. He has the fervent
818          loyalty of a lot of Arabs, for a lot of reasons other than
819          his iron fist and Holy War rhetoric. It would be a big
820          mistake to assume just because he's clearly an insane menace
821          to us, that the Iraqi people--or anybody else in the region-
822          -would rush to thank us for screaming into Baghdad with a
823          squadron of fighter jets to try and blow Saddam and his
824          family into the arms of Allah.
825               There's a joke that defines a "Moderate Arab" as one who
826          holds a blood grudge for only 20 generations. We might be
827          wise to remember that not every society has the microscopic
828          attention span we enjoy here. And in any case, the last thing
829          any Moslem wants, or will tolerate, is a bunch of sunburnt
830          "Zionist Infidels" marching around in their homeland trying
831          to tell them how its gonna be.

841 I'm not so sure that he is insane.  Ruthless, and without morals maybe, but
842 insane...
843  
844 He's playing a very dangerous game, and its one he thinks he can win.  Its the
845 game of conquer, and devide the opposition.  Up until this point I think things
846 have went far worse then he thought they would.  But the thing he has the most
847 of is time, and given enough of it he will be able to attain his goal of 
848 domination of the mideast.  All he needs to do at this point is take a small
849 section of saudi arabia, and he'll have a very large % of the worlds oil
850 reserves under his control.
851  
852 To call him mad is to under estimate him.

859 Hussein isn't mad or crazy. He is a dangerous man, however. My only
860 question is: Why do we protect Kuwait from a country that arguably
861 should have control of that land (it was taken from Iraq at the end of
862 WWII when that area was re-distrubuted) but find ourselves utterly 
863 blameless when we invade Panama and arrest its President when we have

871    Ok, the time is fixed, the date is marked, and the place is set for the
872 2nd annual end-of-summer Backwater party. The time is 5:00pm-6:00pm (pretty
873 fixed, eh?), the date is September 29th, and the place is chez L'homme, ie
874 my house in the wonderful suburb of Tigard. The address is
875 and the home telephone number is 641-xxxx (for those who need
876 additional directions). The plan is for anyone to bring a drink or dessert
877 or whatever (but you don't have to bring anything but yourselves) and I
878 will supply a nutritious dinner or two.
879  
880    I am not very good at giving directions, but here goes a minimal try:
881 Get to 217 (I assume everyone can handle that). Take the Scholl's Ferry
882 Road exit, and head west on Scholl's Ferry (that means people going N
883 on 217 must double back over the freeway, and people going S simply
884 take the exit ramp and turn right). After you get over the freeway, you
885 will meet up with 1 traffic light, then a railroad crossing, then you
886 will meet another traffic light, which is 121st. Keeping going straight.
887 You will meet another traffic light, N. Dakota. Then take the next
888 left, which is Summer Lake Place.
