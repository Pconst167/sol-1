35     Zephyr the rabbit was sitting on his favorite table in the inn, wondering for the thousandth time why nobody
36 liked him. It was really quite beyond his rodent-like, simple little mind. Tears were forming in the corners of his
37 huge eyes at the unfairness of it all.
38     No adventure, no communication, not even a simple hello came his way, but still day after day he stayed at the
39 inn. His mistake.
40     A deep, earthshaking rumbling permeated the building. Glasses rattled in their racks and the few patrons
41 attendant at that hour looked around worriedly. Zephyr looked up and his sensative ears picked up the sounds of
42 machinery over the rumbling. Something huge an terrible was approaching the inn!
43     At last! A chance to show hie worth! He grabbed his bag of magic truffles and hopped off the table and out the
44 door.
45     It was colossal. It was humungous. It was terrible. He ran out of adjectives to describe it. It was a machine,
46 all right, but it was like no machine he ever saw before. It was yellow (gray to him), and for wheels it had two
47 huge cylinders, one in front and one if back. A smokestack belched filth in the air behind it as it rumbled on. In
48 the seat was a man dressed in a black cape and pink polka-dot shorts and army boots, cackling madly and twisting
49 his handlebar mustache. "AtlastIwillhaverevengeonthisplacefordrivingmemad!" he yelled, although Zephyr, of course,
50 could not understand him.
51     The machine bore down on him with frightening speed. The noise, then speed, the sheer SIZE of it was terrifying
52 to the poor rabbit. He did what any rational, brave, thinking being might do in the face of the totally unknown. He
53 froze. The huge front cylinder of the machine loomed over his head, and then all he saw was blackness.
54     Seconds later the steamroller began to slow. Its deisel engine began to cough and sputter. With the front
55 roller less than a foot from the door of the inn, it stopped completely. Out of gas. The madman screamed something
56 about the high cost of deisel fuel as he was dragged away. Nobody noticed, though. They were all gathered around a
57 small red stain on the ground behind the steamroller. A tiny bag of truffles lay nearby. One young woman began to
58 sob uncontrollably and was led away. The innkeeper turned to the crowd and said, "He tried."
59     And so it goes...

66 okay, that's not too bad a story, especially considering that it was complete and almost humorous. But gee golly let's
67 oops- complete AND almost humorous. But gee whiz and golly let's make 'em 
68 shorter and less mysterious. Let's face it all you would-be writers out there,

87 I heartily agree Jose'. I think that an evil government conspiracy set him up
88 and his trying to get him for his past liberalness. They pollute the newspapers
89 against him and make us judge his guilt before it's proven. It's scary, and I
90 think we should all realize how much propaganda we're subjected to.

101           I never learned to laugh when I was happy or cry when I was sad.
102 I never learned this form of communication. With society's harsh judgement,
103 crying is forgotten when childhood is lost. But, there is someway to identify
104 the feeling, someway which I never knew.
105           Dark tree limbs reach through the shadow of locked gates. Whipping
106 across my face, the branches sting. Somewhere, within the thick mass of bark
107 a hand is reaching. I only see a child's image of the tree, a child who never
108 learned. The branches are those that scrapped across my window late at night
109 while I lay petrified beneath warm blankets. The branches are knawing at me,
110 trying to help but never to understand or care.
111           My skin yearns for the gentle touch below the bark. But, never to 
112 feel the hand's back which scraps me like that on a screen window. 
113           Sometimes, I force a laugh to show the trees I feel happiness, or I
114 reveal anger to disguise my pain. Never will some see beyond this calm and
115 emotionless body; never will some see beyond the strained laugh or lash of
116 anger. It's too painful when even a glimpse is caught.
117           And I. Never will I see beyond the wooden armored trees, scratching
118 at my window and tearing at my heart.

149 The helicopter slowly lifted itself off the ground. The blades whirred-whirred
150 'round and 'round like so much chopped air, the metal frame creaking and groan-
151 ing with an effort that betrayed it's thirty-plus years of service.
152 John sat in the co-pilot's seat, munching on a baloney sandwich. As the ground
153 faded slowly below he glanced down at the teeth marks in the white Wonder bread,
154 they still glistened with his saliva. The mayonnaise gleamed in the bright sun-
155 light, which was growing ever stronger as they surged toward the sky. He thought
156 about that mayonnaise... he had heard a story once, about a man with lots of
157 zits... oh, but that was a long time ago. And he needed to finish this sandwich,
158 he needed there energy for what lay ahead. He took another bite and examined
159 the baloney. Oscar Mayer wasn't it?
160 
161 The pilot glanced over, "Oscar who?"
162 John blushed. He realized that his thoughts had been transformed to words with-
163 out his knowing it.
164 
165 "Oh, uh, nothing... just thinking aloud."
166 The whirring of the motor above their heads slowed as the pilot eased the
167 chopper down. Below them, lay only the endless blue of the Pacific Ocean.
168 John glanced at the pilot.
169 "I thought we were going to Des Moines?" he asked nervously.
170 The pilot laughed. "Sorry mac, orders are orders."
171 With a quick motion he turned the aircraft on it's side. The seat belt had been
172 slit, and John found himself floating in the air toward the endless blue.
173 Still clutching the sandwich, he looked at it again. "Yes," he thought. "It
174 was Oscar Mayer... and just like this story, they just make so much baloney..."
175 
176 And just before he landed he called out, "And my name isn't Mac!"
177 
178 But the pilot was long gone. And John was just so much shark bait.
179 
180 Moral: Whether dumb short stories have sandwiches in them or not, most of them
181 are full of lots of baloney.

232 Baloney: The Sequel
233 
234 Just before John splattered his intestines all over the Pacific Ocean, he had
235 let go of that baloney sandwich. The sandwich floated down slowly... it was
236 several minutes before it hit the lapping
237 waves. By the time it his the salty water, John was in a hundred pieces.
238 
239 The half-eaten sandwich floated lazily amidst the waves. As the water creeped
240 into it's processed grains, it crept lower and lower into the ocean. It grew
241 soggy, and soon, disappeared beneath the waves.
242 
243 It wasn't long after that that a bevy of hungry sharks stirred up the waves 
244 around John's body. The fed in a frenzy like never before. It was a long time
245 since they'd gotten a body... not since before the Ford administration anyway.
246 Now with the '84 elections over, and the incumbent feeling power like never 
247 before, well, they knew their bellies would be fuller than ever. This was just
248 the appetizer, and they fed accordingly.
249 
250 Meanwhile, the sandwich floated lazily toward the bottom. It landed gently
251 amidst the swirling sand, pulling softly to and fro with the subtle currents.
252 Soon, a large school of tuna passed overhead, and with one big gulp, one par-
253 ticularly lagre tuna ate it up.
254 
255 It wasn't long after that that the school of fish was captured in a rather large
256 net. And the sandwich lay in the tuna's stomach, waiting, condensing, molding,
257 turning into fish poison...
258 
259 The pilot sat with the blades whirring. Another victim was coming, the tele-
260 phone man had said to be ready. He mused thoughtfully. Not a bad job.
261 
262 He had just finished his sandwich when the man jumped into the chopper. After
263 several pleasantries the helicopter lifted off into the air.
264 
265 ... As the pilots body slumped over the controls, and the harried passenger 
266 worked to steady it, thankful that he had taken helicopter lessons, the ocean
267 below winked in the sunlight. And as the pilot exhaled his last death rattle, a
268 bit of wonder bread eased out, and dropped onto the floor. The tuna laden bread
269 glistened in the sunlight... and all was well with the world.
270 
271 MORAL: If you  can't sing outa tuna, don't sing any of that baloney at all....

278 If you had to choose one board to try first, I would recommend
279 the Bit Bucket (254-xxxx).  It has the most extensive list of
280 local BBS numbers.  It's busy most of the time, but when you do get
281 on download the file BBLOCALS.  If you don't have XMODEM, download
282 it as an ASCII file and you can just copy the numbers off the screen.
283 Most BBS have alists of other BBS numbers, so always look for this option.
284 I think the most difficult board to get into would be Le Nerd.
285 You can get onto the system as a guest, but you don't get full priveleges
286 until the SYSOP has your real name and runs a voice check.  The only way
287 you can talk to the SYSOP to apply is through chat.  On your first time
288 you're not even allowed to leave messages for the SYSOP.
289 Anyway, try out the numbers ME gave you.  There aren't many BBS like
290 BWMS, but there are a few good ones out there.

324 PONDERANCE
325      From my window,
326      I look out upon the world,
327      And in upon myself.
328      The world I see is a mirror of myself.
329      A world so dynamic,
330      Seems so stable,
331      Or maybe not.
332      So gray is this mirror,
333      Only a maze of shadows I see.
334      What is concreate, fades away.
335      And I topple, as a house sans its foundation.
336      All that I see is not so bleak and confused,
337      That I will not prevail.
338      But with survival goes suffering and pain.
339      My thoughts turn from this and then return.
340      Love will survive if it's not already dead.

343 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
344    It was getting later, in more ways than one. The young man sat, sipping his beer and wondering what to do next.
345 Would he be able to find the adventurers? Should he even try? Odds are it would be another dead end if he did. Maybe he
346 should try another track. It was such a big universe he could look forever and still not find...
347    The table shook slightly and he looked up. A strange figure in a hooded cloak had seated itself across from him.
348 Unseen eyes stared at him from the blackness of the hood. Even before words were exchanged, the young man could sense
349 considerable power in that form. Power maybe nearly as great as his own. Big deal.
350    "Yes," he said politely, wondering what was up now.
351    "You seek the adventurers, do you not?" The voice that issued from the hood was definitely feminine. The figure did
352 not move otherwise, probably to build up a sense of mystery. The young man often wondered why some people had this
353 thing for being unnecessarily cryptic and mysterious.
354    Well, he could play that game, too. "Maybe." He slouched back in his chair, feeling it creak alarmingly under him.
355 "Why?"
356    "Perhaps I can help you. And you, in return, can do something for me."
357    I'll bet I could do something for you, he thought, stifling the images that had sprung up in his mind. Down, boy.
358 Let's be nice. "That's, uh, good. I don't like to accept help from strangers, though. So why don't you stop being
359 strange and introduce yourself?"
360    The figure hesitated for a second, and then drew back her hood. The young man felt his heart skip a little. She was
361 about his age (by appearances. It was sometimes hard to tell.). Dark brown hair cascaded about her shoulders. Her face
362 was absolutely flawless and her eyes were also brown, but deep, almost deep enough to get lost in. The images returned
363 to his mind but he found it difficult to be quite so crude and unrefined while staring into those eyes. He felt a
364 little tug on his heart again and wondered what was going on with his circulatory system all of a sudden.
365    "My name is Tariya dal-Silmarilyn. I come from Shai-Kahn province on the world of Kadan. I am... was... a
366 sorceress-in-training. I was released from my bond and now seek the travellers for reasons of my own. I believe I can
367 find them, but have no way to reach them. My, uh, transport has malfunctioned and I am currently stranded here.
368 Something tells me you may be able to help me out. Now that I have introduced myself, perhaps you would do the same?
369 Somehow you seem familiar..."
370    Typical woman. Once they start talking... "Fair enough. My legal name is James Forster Mandell from the province (I
371 guess) of USA on the Late Great Planet Earth-" He stopped suddenly. Those eyes had been warm, comforting, and yes,
372 maybe even inviting but now they showed only fear. Mortal fear. "What's wrong?"
373    Her voice was suddenly small and trembling. "Oh my God." she whispered, "The Destroyer!"

376 She said "Yes, I know you... all of you. You're all creeps! You run around with
377 your tongues hanging out and your only interest is killing and rutting!"
378 "Kill and rut, kill and rut! Nothing but kill and rut"
379 He mused that she was sounding like a flapping flat tire.
380 "Well, I'm sick of it! You hear me?"
381 She whipped off her cloak to reveal a perfect, indescribably delicious naked
382 nubile young body. Everything was perfect, and in place. Everything.
383 But she also had a bugblatter blaster that was tuned into the 9th power of
384 Razmagon.
385 The light seared through his chest, the red blood spurted on the floor, and his
386 intestines hung out grossly.
387 He collapsed... the last human... and the human race died with him.

389 She put on her clothes, blew on the barrel of her gun, and giggled.

392 Oh, and so it goes,
393 For were it to be, but it not,
394 then wherever we might roam,
395 It might remain a mystery.
396 For soon we shall see, or not at all,
397 But listening for thine voice,
398 raises expectations of perfection,
399 to the highest degree,
400 of perpitude and amongst them all,
401 The trees grow greener and the sky stands still,
402 But still we must grow, and have it not be,
403 Else we shan't know,
404 perfection.

432 Three bald women, I knew once in a bar
433 I sweet talked them for hours, then got them to my car.
434 We drove and drove for hours,
435 Their heads glistened in the light.
436 These women were quite interesting,
437 you might even call them bright.
438 But I'm sure you all are wondering,
439 What happened with these chicks,
440 Well that would not be fair, to tell you of my kicks.
441 Just let me tell you simply, their scalps turned me on so,
442 But three bald women on a night like that, naa, my barber told me NO!
443 
444 Uh, I bet you don't think this is very good, but like the really clever
445 person above, I think it is just as good as anything else on here that
446 I see and the words just came out as I sat here on the keyboard, so there.

457 The difference between what sounds like what other people have written
458 and what you just did on the keyboard is there is meaning and thought
459 not to mention time put into these things. Whether or not you understtand what was written the fact is that it was put there 
460 for people to see and to critize (in a positive manner) or comment on
461 or even to ignore but not to be mocked or cut down. Vive la difference.

466 Nice poem, wish I had written it. Thanks
467 to whoever the author may be, did you 
468 have an evening like mine, or were just
469 trying to get a feel for the mood.  Or perhaps you are one of the ones that knows my true identity, and you taunt me
470 in fun.

475 tsl -- Yeah, I know.  I'm kinda lost too.  I'd be glad to follow your lead, or
476 take the lead if you'd rather.  I've been busy the last few days and need to 
477 put some thought into the situation.  It strikes me (ouch) however, that
478 the ZEB lady came from a reversed situation... now she's turned around and
479 working along our time-line.  She doesn't learn, she gets rid of information.
480 With your character trying to come to grips with herself, we may have the
481 potential to work something out.

491 Note to the evolution question:
492 
493 Evolution is a huge farce made up by the scientific community  to explain what
494 they don't know. Certain things have evolved, sure, from what they were to a
495 slightly more changed (not always better!) form, but don't you think it odd
496 that the only link they're missing is
497 THE missing link?
498 It sounds corny, but by golly, there is a God, and well, he made us.
499 Scientists don't want to believe anything so simple, but sorry folks, we only
500 go back  6,000 years. The rest is just
501 baloney...
502 
503 That's all for now....

506 Note to person with %&%&%&%&%&% border:
507 I agree, I wasn't really belittling the other poems, it just seems to me that we take things too seriously. And let's be ho
508 setoops
509 honest, sometimes in the interest of being "artsy"", the message is lost. Straightforward always works better. And... humor i
510 s a lost art.... But I respect other people's works, parodies are sometimes the vbest form of flattery, and I apologize if Ih
511 hurt anyone's feelings.... By for now

514 Or are you just crude? Do you have smimming pools and know movie stars? Do
515 you have a crazy banker and a dumb son and a foxy daughter and an old granny?

527 No, I'm not the same Jeb. I'm GEB. Completely different. And I'm not lying. I'm
528 sitting here pounding on my keyboard, trying to make sense of the world.

537 And the animals sup,

550      "How COULD they have squashed my truffles?"  TI asked, trying to pull the
551 bag from underneath the large machine.  With a final tug the small bag, dripping
552 with the red preservative I use to keep my truffles fresh, was freed from the
553 
554 prison.  I was upset to find that all the truffles were squashed.  T
555      "That's the way life is, I guess." I thought, pulling my second bag of 
556 truffles out and nibbling on one.  I then 
557 hopped back into the Inn.....
558      There was that smiley-face shirt person again, talking to a cloaked
559 figure.  I wonder what this willbring about.  Munching on my truffle, I watched and waited for the developments.

566 object in the air at one time or maybe he juggles things not so material.
567 The man with these objects of, I think, intangibleness wears the an intense
568 expression of deep concentration.  Yet, his often mournful words seem to 
569 have faded, as if he is no longer so willing to divulge whatever may pass
570 his mind.  The lines of concentration or the ocassional smile or smirk while
571 he speaks lightheartedly (it has been observed that he spoke this way, dispite
572 the gray-gloomy mood he showed here) seems to have been replaced.  Even the 
573 sad eyes are absent.  The succeeder of his expression is taunt and drawn
574 distant wearing a frown.  I watch and wonder what has happened to this lost
575 friend (?) who's company I did once enjoy.  Perhaps, he is juggling on 
576 another street corner or the ideas in his mind have fallen past his hand.
577 Or it's just me.  Eh, friend?  //  from another, or less correctly called
