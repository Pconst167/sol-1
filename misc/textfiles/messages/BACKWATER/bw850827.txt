20 Kathy: It is something that I have learned the hard way over many years.
21 How can you trust anyone? You make a lot of calculations, but in the end
22 you trust them because they are trust worthy. Why are they trust worthy?
23 because you trust them. Like love, trust is not something you can buy or 
24 sell. And also as with love, you get back as much trust as yougive.
25 Oh yes, there are those who violate that trust, just as there are those
26 who will use love to their own ends, but it usually last very long, they
27 are soon found out. You tell someone about a private part of your life.
28 Why did you do so? Because you trust that they will treat it with the 
29 respect it deserves. Why? Because they have done so in the past. So how
30 do you know that? Because you have trusted them in the past with such
31 things. The trust grew because you gave that trust little by little. It
32 stops at the level where you feel that they can't be trusted at. How do
33 you know when this is? When they no longer treat it with the respect it
34 is due. Trust and love are very similar emotions.

99   The vortex at first took the piper in gentle hands, tugging at outstreched
100 arms and feet, later grasped more firmley, and at last twisted with cruel
101 strength as their prey spun falling through the long tunnel.  The piper's
102 time sense, long disabled from the time in no-space, could not estimate the
103 time of the journey.  When, at last, he was hurtled, buffeted and bruised,
104 onto what seemed to be a polished black marble floor, he lay exhausted
105 for long moments.
106   The piper considered himself doubly lucky as he lay sprawled on the polished
107 blackness.  Firstly, he was not particularly susceptible to motion sickness.
108 Secondly, it had been a long, long time since he had eaten -- what 
109 susceptibility he had would have made its prescence spectacularly visible
110 had his stomach had any contents whatever.  Although, he considered with
111 his body racked with dry heaves, at least something to eject would give that
112 vile organ something to do other than torment him.

116   sitting in the circle on the other end of the link from bard, lady tAyree
117 began to think of what it is was going to be like to experience the re-
118 appearance of someone that had just a short while ago disappeared.  just a
119 short while ago?  it certainly doesn't feel all that short any longer.
120   "ohm...  pi...  ohm..."  she muttered while concentrating on the image she
121 remembered as that of piper.  "i ecrtainly hope that this is going to work,
122 it has to...  it just has to!" she thought.
123   "ohm...  pi...  ohm..."  perspiration began to form on the brows of all
124 those that sat in the semi-circle.  trainor just watched with awe at the 
125 light that began to illuminate those seated before him.

129 (Renan, where I hope you do not stop writing, the understanding that all 
130 people come from different "points" in life, is critical. Self-confidence
131 is wonderful, but if it is not had by some, why speak with such remarks
132 of distaste?

137      Those of us who find ourselves drowning in the cold black sea of despair
138 sometimes leave our fetal position and look above the churning waters, into
139 the eyes of those who would have us drown, rather than risk slipping into
140 the waters themselves. Sometimes, just sometimes, we reach out and grabt
141 these onlookers who stray to closly and we pull them towards ourselves. It
142 is not with malice that we do this, but in panic and fear. Today I pulled,
143 but I don't feel sorry about pulling. I pulled a person with all my might,
144 but they were steadfast and did not budge from the shore. It is probably
145 the best for them, and the worst for me. You see, the biggest problem with
146 pulling is in failing, and falling down deeper and deeper tha
147 before. This is the shame and despair of defeat, but it is an enevitable
148 part of the life we lead just trying to keep our head above water.

181    Curled up like a ball in the corner, face to a blank wall wondering
182 why she didn't want to continue on in her life.  With a knife in one hand
183 all there was to see were memories thought to be lost, but now all those
184 pictures from the past were stretched out in front of her face on that
185 blank wall.
186    The hate whirled inside her, despite the freezing weather comming through
187 the many open windows of her little apartment.  She wants to be free of all
188 the mistakes that formed her life, even she was a mistake.
189    The memories of past friends she once had, friends that couldn't take the
190 time to listen to her when she needed a friend to talk to.  She never told
191 them up front what she was feeling, leaving it for them to guess at, but they
192 never did.  Memories of all of the people she knew, what would they think know?
193 This will surely give them a shock!  Maybe this once they would sit up and
194 notice who I am, what I am.  This will teach them.

198     Emu had been trained in personal meditation, primarily as a method of
199 relaxation and mental 'regrouping' of thoughts, feelings, and all of the
200 other clutter'ers of the mind.  He had seen this sort of combined effort
201 in other circumstances, but never with the power that seemed to be present.
202 Cragmore was truly a well trained mentalist.
203     As the others started repeating their private chant, Emu was reminded
204 of his own chant and it's curious origin.  Emu's chant was not the usual
205 simple one sylable sound, but a more complex, two syllable utterance: lazlo.
206 He smiled as he thought of the chant's namesake.  Many years before, when
207 Emu was learning some of the simple secrets of his universe, he came across
208 a brilliant teacher.  This person opened Emu's mind to the truth:
209   [ ^ is AND ]
210      (P ^ Q) => (R ^ S)
211      (T => Q) ^ (S => U)
212      (W => P) ^ (T => U)
213      !R
214      --------------------
215           W => P
216 
217 Emu had been very impressed when he saw the insight expressed, and from then
218 on, this professor was Emu's 'guru', and his first name became a permanent
219 part of Emu's mandala and meditations.
220     "Lazlo ... lazlo ... lazlo ... lazlo ... lazlo ..."
221 .-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.Emu
222 L_L_L_: DON'T DO IT!!!  PLEASE!!  Sure, the others will notice you, but what
223     good will it be if you are not here to receive that recognition.  Many
224     in your position forget that death is irreversible.  YOU CAN'T COME BACK
225     from death.
226         There are many other ways to attract the attention that you crave.  One
227     that you may not have tried is to simply ask for the attention.  Ask your
228     mother and father for a hug.  They may not have told you lately that they
229     love you, and they might need help too in expressing themselves.  Help them
230     to communicate to you by telling them that you love them.
231         You are a special person!  You can help your friends communicate and
232     you and each other, by reaching out your hand to them.  Maybe you've read
233     some of the preceding on loneliness?  The way to help is to reach out your
234     hand to someone.  Grab the person next to you, give them a hug, and tell
235     them that you love them!  Even if you don't feel it... the feelings will
236     come.
237         Give life a chance!

239 l'Homme:  What's all this about CP/M and Kaypro stuff?  Give me a call

243      As usual, I seem to be misunderstood.  Perhaps the problem lies in my 
244 ability to make my self clear.  At least that is the premise that I will try
245 to adopt.
246      I do not attempt to ignore those that flounder in the waters, they have
247 both my sympathy and my support.  It is those that wallow in the waters of
248 depression, reveling in their misfortune, mus  usually of their own making.
249 (sorry, later........ line noise.
250 :|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|: Renan :|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:|:
251      Later...
252      Depression ia a state of mind rather that of being.  It is a normal 
253 reaction to some of the things that happen to us in our lives.  However,
254 some people adopt this attude purposefully.  Seemingly as some form of penance
255 for some imagined trangression.  You can see them on the street.  They stand
256 apart from the crowd, head lowered, shoulders slumped.  They 'dress down', 
257 wearing neutral colors to blend in with the background.  They speak when 
258 spoken to, but otherwise for the most part remain silent.  They are slow to
259 speak of themselves, if they do at all.
260      How these people come to be as they are is hard to see.  Sometimes it
261 becomes obvious when you see the other people in their lives; spouses and 
262 parents especially.  The people that help us create our self image.
263      All this is who these people are.  The differences come when you look 
264 at who they are trying to be.  To the ones who strive to shake off this negative
265 self-image, my admiration and support.  But neither I, nor anyone else can do
266 it for them.  Only they can change how they look at themselves.  It is not an
267 easy decision to make, deciding that you are a good and worthwhile person
268 in spite of all your flaws and drawbacks.  In spite of what others might tell
269 you, through their actions, speech, or silence.

288      Behind me lie the waves, the briney scent does not allow me to
289 forget from whence I came.  I have turned my back on it for now.  Before
290 my path is the road that might lead to any of a hundred possible fresh
291 horizons.  To the south is a lagoon, lush with the sea creatures that
292 take the tranquil waves as their home.  To the north lies the barren
293 wasteland, there I could find solice amoung the caribou, but no.
294      To the east, far to the east lies the vast desert of my opening 
295 mind.  To trod across the soil and into the sand fills me with a sensa-
296 tion I have not experienced before.  Its newness enshrouds me as I take
297 in the sight of the nothingness.  Soon there are only the crests of sand
298 for as far as the eye may perceive.  Quite the same is the spirit even
299 when the sea has changed from that of droplets to granules.
300      In my travels I come o reach a solid block that bars my path.  It
301 is no taller than I, and as I draw near it gleams with its cheval glass
302 surface facing me.  I approach only to see that which I fear most.
303 Within the reflection I see that which is truly my inner self.  As I
304 cringe, the image stands with the utmost of confidence.  I see that if I
305 am to gain any strength, it will only come if aided by the good side of
306 my own pride.  Perhaps the help I need does exists within.
307      Cautiosly, I lift a hand to touch that which is the reflection of
308 my secret pasts, my hidden futures.  Heat begins to seethe from the very
309 tendrils of my fingertips.  Am I being drawn to true self realization?

315   The human brain is a curious organ.  Having no sensation of its own, it
316 is dependent upon the network of nerve sensors throughout our body for all
317 its inputs.  Our experience of reality is the sum of these inputs.  Deprived
318 of sensation, reality disappears and the brain creates its own...
319   The waves of nasuea finally faded, leaving the piper limp and weak on the
320 polished black floor.  Slowly he pushed himself away from the soiled black
321 surface, noticing as he did so the gleaming points of light embedded deep
322 within its substance.  Mouth still warm from the acids, the piper stepped
323 away from the repellent puddle that even an empty stomach can produce under
324 enough stress, and tried to rub the scent of sickness out of his nostrils
325 as he looked at his surroundings.
326   He was standing on a featurless black plain, smooth and polished as far
327 as his eyes could see.  Above was featureless whiteness, supplying the
328 light.  It could be a very carefully painted flawless ceiling, only slightly
329 out of arm's reach, or an infinite depth of luminous space -- it was 
330 impossible for the piper to tell the difference.  Kneeling, he examined the
331 black surface more carefully.  Smooth, hard and black, he could detect
332 faint points of light within its surface, but could make no impression with
333 his fingernails.  He was about to try the surface with a knife when a
334 noise brought him whirling about.
335   Standing before him was a small being, sexless in gray robes, face shadowed
336 by the cowl of the robe it wore.
337   "You won't be able to scratch it."  a cool voice repeated.
338   Ever quick of wit, "Wha?" the piper responded.
339   "It's too hard.  I've tried, but I just can't get through it."
340   The figure moved toward the piper, accompinied by a blaze of light from the
341 surface beneath it.
342   "What?" the piper pointed at the light with a finger.
343   "It is a consequence of my existence here," the figure replied.  I draw my
344 sustenance from the light you see.  My existence is dependent upon it.
345 It serves me as food and drink.  In this place, you are the same."
346   The piper moved slightly, watching the surface beneath himself.  As he did
347 so, a barely perceptible glow radiated up from the surface, the radiance
348 seeming to flow into his body rejuvinating his energy.  Moving again, the
349 radiance seemed to increase, bringing with it greater rewards.
350   "Who are you?  What is this place?  What is this radiance?" the p
351 questioned, looking closely at the figure before him.
352   For a long moment, the figure stood silent, head bowed then it looked at
353 him.  Within the shadow of the cowl, he could see two tormented eyes with
354 tears running down from both of them, tracing silvery trails along an
355 anguished face.
356   "The radiance," began the figure, "is life.  Or rather the destruction of
357 it.  It is our only means of survival."  The figure reached up and brushed
358 the cowl of the robe back, revealing the long hair and delicate features
359 of a tearful young woman.  "This place is the interface between bands of
360 realities.  You may call me ZEB."

388 I was woken by a knock at the door of the apartment.  I looked up to
389 notice that my clock said 6:00 AM.  " Who could this be at this hour? "
390 Putting on some clothes, I rose to answer the door surprized to find
391 to gentlemen in uniforms, blue uniforms.  At first I thought maybe
392 it was just some disturbance in the complex but soon I found out they
393 were there just for me.  Fear suddenly shot through my body.  I froze
394 in my footsteps.  One officer came forward and read me a name and number
395 asking if I recognize them, unfortunatly I did.  The next comment that
396 followed was "I'm sorry but we have a warrent for you arrest".  There
397 was nothing I could do.  I went with them handcuffed like a common 
398 criminal and I had no idea what I had done, neither did the two policemen
399 They just told me that I would find out when we got down to the jail.....

403   The wall seemed to brighten a little bit as she hesitated with her
404 final cry.  Confusion swept through her, what did she realy want?
405 All the things in life were terrible and she didn't want to continue
406 seeing them any more.  She was tired, tired of the whole thing!
407   She looked around her frozen body and what little clothing she had
408 out on those many days ago.  Her body ached as she tried to get up,
409 but again she found herself on the cold floor.  Many times the effort
410 was made to get on her feet, get going again, but as always it failed,
411 like it will fail again.  She would screem if she could, even that
412 was too difficult.  It was time to just wait.  Soon all these agonies
413 would be over.

416            the screaming hairy hominids ran in pursuit of Rake as he
417 sl;ipped on a pile of something slippery in the school cafeteria. It stained 
418 his Nike`s brown. Fortunately his blaster had a full charge and with a gracefullballet step he dropped
419 to one knee and ,drawing from the hip,hit the repeating stud. Blossoms of blue energy struck the 
420 disguised faculty members and reduced them to hot raw meat. It steamed nicely.
421 Jim awoke with his face buried in his mashed potatoes and gravey.

423 TIME TRAVEL AND YOU.
424 
425 Strange things happen when you interfere with the space time continuim. There is on record,
426 documented proof that people have actually been turned into sheezfood by simply not setting your
427 directional warp pointer back to zero after every flight. Then there was the man who materialized
428 inside a very small orange. Needless to say, it was just a bit cramped. The amazing thing was, that
429 the person who ate the orange actually managed to swallow the poor soul. simple thing to remember,
430 DO NOT leave your time machine on "auto continium monitor". Time machines have a mind of their own
431 `when traversing the continium day after day. They occasionally pick up phrases of speech, and
432 SOMETIMES even coordinates that it feels you would like the least, and promptly takes you there.
433 It then turns itself off and will turn a deaf microchip to your pleading and groveling.

436 Emu: Could you please restate that in Lukasiewicz notation?
437 Also, am I correct in assuming that:

439 (also  P and Q  ::  Kpq)
440 (and   P or Q  ::  Apq)

466   The piper paused for a long moment, trying to allow this information to
467 sink in.  "I don't really understand," he finally said.  "What is the 
468 nature of this place?  How do we exist here?  How did you get here?"
469   She turned from the piper, the hem of the long grey robe sweeping over
470 the black surface, bringing a wash of light from deep within.  "How can
471 I begain?  There is so much to tell..."
472   The piper, sensing a need for comfort, stepped forward and took hold of
473 her shoulders in his large hands.  "Begin with this place.  What is the
474 nature of this place?  What do you mean by an interface between bands of
475 reality?  Is it not reality by the fact of two of us sharing it?"

479 _________________________________________________________________________
480    When I started I thought of it as an experiment. Instead of hate cond-
481 itioning, I tried compassion conditioning. I see now that it was foolish
482 to think such an experiment could keep up a steady pace for long. My words
483 have been twisted, I have been insulted by nameless faceless creatures,
484 and the direction has taken a new course which I no longer wish to persue.
485 I thank those who voyaged with me even for awhile. I learned and I grew,
486 but now, I must leave. I trust you all can find solace in your new paths,
487 but mine must continue in the opposite direction. I am hurt by some of
488 the words on here, and in my present state I need no additional hurting.
489 Good luck dear letters, may your travels continue and may you have more
490 strength than I.

494      I must admit that I have not aided you well, c.  I saw from before
495 the beginning the path you had wished to journey, and still I went my own
496 way.  Each of us have those pieces of sorrow that we would greatly share
497 with others if that would make living any easier.  In relating that which
498 is thought to have been unique, we have found others that mirror us.
499      It was never my intention to cross anyone, the words I have given
500 were only meant to have been helpfully prodding in some small way, I
501 failed in my choice of words.
502      I do not doubt that we shall ever see you again, but if our paths
503 are never to cross again, thank you for having given a few of us the
504 nerve to put in words the feeling that would otherwise have remained
505 buried too far within us.
506      **kathyd**, allow me to it in other words:  Because two individuals
507 do not have the same stand, the same point of view on any given topic
508 shouldn't inhibit the conversation.  It provides both with a chance to
509 speak their mind, see the possible alternatives, and perhaps reconsider
510 just where they really stand.  I hadn't meant to hamper your discussions
511 with Cistop Mikey, and I hope that you are ablr to resume them with a
512 full wind in your sails....
513      Yes, I do look up into the glass to see that which is myself.  And
514 the face I see stares back with a condecending scowl.  It shan't be easy.

544 Of course I could always be surprised, but somehow my memory keeps me from giving that much merit.
545 Mikey: Sorry I did not get by with the adventures last week. I will do so Tuesday. I leave for Queenly

547 they don't have formal meetings yet. Tom Almy is going to show me their first newsletter tomorrow, and
548 I will get any information I can from it. No COPYLINK news to report, except that it is working great

571  "God damn bugs, this lousy jungles crawling with them" Parker half-laughed.
572  Bradford and Jones just kept staring into the mist covered foilage. There was a
573 reason for them to act that way. I called over to Parker, "If you don't keep 
574 your big trap shut I'll shut it for you
575 , Corporal"
576 "Lieutenant, He's going to get us all
577 killed. Just like he did back at Phong
578 Mua."
579  I knew how Jones felt, that was a closeone for all of us. Now all thats left 
580 of Delta company is the four of us.
581 There was no way I would have thought
582 this morning that are usual morning 
583 parimater scout would turn into a 10
584 mile hike for life. Not really all that difficult untill you add in whats just 
585 happened in the past 2 hours. Little 
586 Phoenix, offically Charlie Two Echo, 
587 ceased to exist at least in the way that it had existed when we started this 
588 patrol.  We had been outside the gates for almost an hour when the shelling 
589 first started. We went back as quickly as we could considering the terrain
590  But by the time we got to the camps parimater we could see that there was 
591 nothing left bigger than a crushed can.
592 We had heard of similar attacks they said that it was a new Soviet weapon. That
593 is one heck of a weapon.
594   We had decided to try to get to Houston, the closest know camp that we still 
595 held. It seemed that they were going down faster than they could be reported. 
596 But we had to make a try. We were about a mile out when we heard them.
597 The Viet Chong that had just finished
598 leveling off our camp. We just wanted to slip by them. Thats when Parker started.

607       Ah, there's nothing like the brisk workout provided by cleaning up
608 after almost everyone's gone, no longer pasing the time away by looking in
609 the darkened corners...  The notion that gets me to wondering is this:
610 What is it that has been cleared out to provide so much more breathing room
611 to those that remain, seated quietly where the filtering sun finds no place
612 to land?  Oh well, destiny will find its way to even this hallowed hutch.
613       Looking back at the counter, there is no one there.  Those that I had
614 once envisioned as being ever present are now but memories, fading rapidly
615 with each passing hour.  The friendship, the comradarie...  where are they
616 now that the seasons have changed?
617       Well, that's all behind me now.  No sense trying to latch onto the
618 past, it's time I head back to the future.  Words spoken, words not spoken,
619 tipped flagons spilling what little that remains into the shadows...  that
620 is behind me.  Now I face down the road, a short distance from me sits the
621 pixie that draws in the sands of the bank by the stream.
622       Closer examination will provide the answers that do not seem readily
623 apparent.  The fact that the drawings are simple should not confuse the
624 viewer that the story, the definition may be far more complex than dreamed
625 of.  Dreams...  what strange things.  But then, so are the drawings...
626       The sound of the rushing current, the scent of the trees telling you
627 that the leaves are soon to turn amber and red, the feel of the cool breeze
628 as it plays upon your face...  They all play with the meaning, with the mind.
