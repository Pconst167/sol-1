 50 A Commode 64 with a 30meg hard disk? How did you manage that? I have never been
 51 able to get more that 28meg at a time because of the stupid way Commode handles
 52 the Virtual Disk Addresses and the File Allocation Table. Since the top two
 53 bits are chopped from the FAT and XORed with the VDA, you lose 2^12 possible
 54 addresses, making a 30meg hard disk an impossibility. I have a feeling you are
 55 just giving us a line about 30meg hard disks and Commodes, and you only have
 56 a 28meg partition on your 30meg. ~pants on fire and all that...
 57  
 58 By the way, how does a school go around kicking ass, and why should it strive
 59 to do such an unproductive and potentially explosive action? If a state
 60 institution of higher learning wants to go around bruising the behinds of
 61 people in the state, it should do so with a little more executive decorum and
 62 a little less bombaste.

 73      There use to be a house here,  a bit worn and ragged in places, but 
 74 comfortable.   The  sort that grows on you in time.   A friend lived  in 
 75 that house,  a very good friend.  The sort of friend you can talk to and 
 76 not be afraid of what you say.   A friend who knows you and  understands 
 77 you.  
 78      I  felt safe and comfortable in that home,  it was as if it was  my 
 79 own home.   Oh, it wasn't always that way of course.  At first there was 
 80 uncertainty and fear.   But in time that went away,  and was replaced by 
 81 the certainty of our friendship.  I knew that I was always welcome.  And 
 82 I knew that I could say the things I couldn't talk about without fear of 
 83 being hurt. 
 84      That doesn't mean things were always perfect,  far from it.  By the 
 85 very  nature  of our friendship I found I could say things that I  would 
 86 never  be  able  to say to anyone else  under  the  same  circumstances.  
 87 Things  from deep in my heart and soul.   Things I normally keep  hidden 
 88 behind locked and barred doors.  
 89      I wasn't always able to talk of such things,  but in time the trust 
 90 and  security  grew  until I knew that we could talk about  such  things 
 91 without destroying the friendship we had.   And my friend could speak to 
 92 me in the same way with the same feeling of trust and security.  Knowing 
 93 that things could always be talked out.
 94      But today when I went there the house was gone.  The lot was empty, 
 95 with  weeds  growing as if the house had never been  there.   My  friend 
 96 gone.  The safe secure house no longer there to make me feel comfortable 
 97 and at home.  Nothing but an empty lot.  
 98      Life goes on,  but it will never be the same.  How can it when  the 
 99 best friend you've ever known is gone.

104 The dirt from the day caked over the dirt from yesterday.  Shim Jitzu was more 
105 than uncomfortable, he was dirty.  It had been three days since he had bathed,
106 and more than six days had past since the ritual baths of his faith had been
107 partaken.  He reached up to the handle of his katana, that rested above his 
108 left shoulder.  It brought him at least a sense of peace.  He then ritually 
109 touched the handle of his wakasashi, the little brother that rest upon his
110 right hip.  He made a prayer sign that indicated his hope that he would not 
111 have to use them, and another that they would not fail him if he did.  Looking 
112 far ahead he saw an inn.  He thought that he may stop there for the night... 
113 and a bath.

220 #$%&'($%&'()0$%&'()0$%&'()0$%&'()0$%&'(
221    The sky was black, minus the
222 millions of stars shining through from
223 the hea On the eastern horizon,
224 a pale moon rose above the hills to
225 look down on the scene. I stood on a
226 small cliff, probing through the
227 night.
228    The world was all but silent. I
229 listenthe crickets, but was
230 left unsatisfied. In the distance, the
231 cry of a bird cut through the night.
232 It started at a high pitch, and fell
233 until it was silenced.
234    A shadow disappeared into the
235 forestoft light replaced it.
236 Hidden in amongst a sleeping rhodaden-
237 dron, I saw the dark contour of a pale
238 face, unalive, yet warning. Next to it
239 I saw a gleeming blade covered with
240 thin blood. My mind told me to escape,
241 and I obeyed without question, gliding
242 into tair.
243    The sound of my wings soon became
244 familiar to me. It beat through my
245 head at regular intervals. Soon, it
246 was joined with a replica of that
247 sound, and the realization came
248 slowly I looked back and saw 
249 nothing, but I knew it was there.
250    I came to a hill, and began to run
251 parellel to it. The moonlit trees
252 would have acted like a thousand
253 knives had I not seen them. I came
254 acrossrface, and glided over
255 it for a moment. The surface of the
256 trees had whispered to me, and the
257 forest was alive, but only asleep. 
258 This surface was silent, and seemed 
259 to stretch to infinity. I broke
260 through the barrier, and as I sank
261 below, became heavy and 
262 sluggish. I felt my lungs collapsing,
263 but dared not rise. I listened for any
264 sound, but heard nothing. I was forced
265 up for air, and began scanning for any
266 sign of my predator. There was
267 nothinven the wind was still.
268    With a great heaving of my arms, I
269 staggered ashore and into the
270 whispering pines. A sharp branch
271 blocked my path, and I felt the cool 
272 blood fill my eyes, as consciousness 
273 desert
274    I awoke the next morning, feeling
275 well rested. I looked around to see a
276 bright room, secluded among the
277 treetops with the sun pouring in a 
278 window behind me. Promptly, a girl
279 with black feathers entered and asked,
280 "Are yight?". I thought for a
281 moment, remembering the previous
282 night. "I've got to get out of here,"
283 I replied at last. I tried to pull
284 myslelf up, but again felt helpless. 
285 "You couldn't, I mean..." I forced 
286 myselfnd the voice trailed off.
287 "I'm being followed," I said instict-
288 ivly, and staggered out. 
289    Within minutes, I was again above
290 the trees heading west. "Where am I
291 going?" I thought to myself. I remem-
292 bered k tails of "other lands"
293 which were supposedly beyond the
294 world. I turned the idea over in my
295 head for awhile, wondering what could 
296 possibly be ahead.
297    I continued west for the remainder
298 of the day. The sun set in front of
299 me, tuhe sky scarlet, before
300 revealing the familiar constellations.
301 The moon rose, shedding her pale light
302 across the lands, and before I came to
303 rest, she had begun her journey toward
304 the western horizon. I set in the
305 forestistened to the night,
306 before falling asleep.
307    I continued, before frost was on the
308 trees, flying mostly at night, and 
309 resting in the day. I kept wondering 
310 if I was still being followed. Once I
311 thoughad heard something, 
312 but turned to see nothing, and assumed
313 it to be my imagination.
314  
315    After traveling what seemed as long
316 as the sun's path, I came to a vast
317 body of water. It set the horizons on
318 each swell as in front of me.
319 I plunged into yet another world,
320 containing many small animals and some
321 colourful plants. If it hadn't been
322 for my need of air, I would have
323 stayed to see more, but was pushed to 
324 its su  Majestic mountains shot up from the
325 lands, and their snow-covered peeks
326 shot rays of sunlight across the
327 skies. I tried to reach the top of
328 one, but soon became breathless. Their
329 bases were covered with green, which
330 was pawhite further up, and 
331 crystalized near the top.
332  
333    As I was walking along the white
334 sands by the water, A loud cry
335 suddenly froze me where I stood, and
336 soon I felt cold hands around my neck,
337 tighteand choking. I threw a
338 close rock behind me, but was freed
339 for only a moment. A spear was
340 unsheathed, to reveal a glimmering
341 point. I watched helplessly, as it was
342 thrust toward my chest, and before it
343 found k, my hunter fell aside,
344 with an arrow in his back. I turned 
345 quickly, only to see a few black
346 feathers disappear into the green veil
347 of the forest.

411      As I walked the once familiar path to the land forgotten, I gave thanks
412 that I had once more found the map, so long missing, that led me back here.
413 The changes were no more noticable than previous times reality had run amuck,
414 with the Bolo tanks and Hairy Fishnuts.  I put it up to the Piper, who
415 sometimes did things like this.  As I turned the bend, I beheld a sight not
416 pleasant to my eyes;  the inn had changed.  Not the run of the mill
417 changes, but a very new building, with the Roman numeral II glowing softly
418 overhead.  Going inside, I notice that, although much looks the same, my
419 old friends (and enemies) are missing.  Mikey is still here, I see, but where
420 are the others?  My long absense seems to portend more changes than the mere
421 passage of time can account for.  This bears close investigation....

451 (* IIIIIIIVVVIVIIVIIIIX (*) IXVIIIVIIVIVIVIIIIII *)
452 The Continuing Adventure of the Shape-Changer (and the Magus (?))
453      The Dancer leaned back in the huge bathtub and sighed with pleasure.
454 This is the life, she thought, servants at my beck and call, living in a
455 palace, and nobody, I hope, out to get me.  Well, nobody yet anyway.
456      The warm water was quickly working to sooth her tired muscles.  That,
457 coupled with the somewhat immoderate quantity of food she had recently
458 eaten, induced a state of deep lethargy verging on sleep.  It would be
459 sooooo nice just to close my eyes and drift, slowly, slowly to sleep.
460      A gentle but firm touch on her shoulder startled the Dancer out of her
461 nap.  She surged upright and turned to face the intruder.  Intent only on
462 defense, she was crouched in the stance of a trained fighter, oblivious to
463 the water which sloshed over the sides of the tub and onto the tile floor.
464      The young woman facing her was wide-eyed at the reaction she had
465 caused.  "Please . . . I beg your pardon, Lady," she stammered, her posture
466 submissive.  "My mistress, the Princess Royal, sent me to see if everything
467 was satisfactory.  She was concerned when you did not reappear after
468 several hours."
469      Hours?  Ahmryaba was suddenly aware that the bath water she was
470 standing in was tepid, no longer possessing the relaxing warmth which had
471 lulled her to sleep.
472      She smiled with chagrin at the waiting woman and said, "Please tell
473 your mistress that I will be with her shortly.  My need for sleep seems to
474 have been greater than my desire to get clean."
475      The woman bowed warily and left the room.
476      So much for first impressions, the Dancer thought as she turned the
477 hot water tap to refill the tub.  I can just guess what sort of stories
478 will be spread through the servant's quarters tonight.
479      She settled back down into the slowly rewarming water and begin
480 vigorously soaping and rinsing her body.  Stretching out fully in the tub
481 she submerged to wet her long silver-white hair.  As she sat up again and
482 worked shampoo into the tangled mass of hair her thoughts were rueful.  So
483 much for keeping a low profile.  Once again I'm news on the grapevine in
484 less than a day.
485      Filling a dipper with clean water from the tap, Ahmryaba did a
486 thorough and final rinse.  She twisted her long hair to get rid of excess
487 water, and stepped out of the tub.  As she toweled dry her thoughts were
488 resolutely fixed on the future.  She knew from past experiences that it was
489 beyond her ability to prevent the rumor mill from turning.
490      A long silken robe, of a green color nearly matching the color of her
491 eyes, was hanging from a hook on the wall nearest the tub.  Skin dry and
492 hair combed, Ahmryaba slipped her arms into the sleeves of the robe.  Ah, I
493 could get used to this rich life, she thought, belting the robe about her
494 waist.  She eyed the pile of dirty rags she had worn before bathing,
495 recoiling slightly at the smell the pile emitted.  I'm not quite certain
496 how this little jaunt is going to end, but I doubt that I'll leave smelling
497 quite as bad as I did on arriving.  She stepped into a pair of flat
498 slippers and went to rejoin her royal employer.

503 The door to the Inn open easily, obviously having been well used.  A glance
504 around the room told him little, as the brightness of the high afternoon sun
505 refused to pierce the relatively dark interior of the Inn.  A portly man tended
506 the bar.  Entering, a squint forcing itself to his face, Shim Jitsu asked,
507 "Sir, a room with a bath would be appreciated.  Also, a meal."
508 "You got the money, FRIEND, you can get almost anything around here... to
509 include more trouble than those fancy swords can get you out of.  Price of the
510 room is on the board behind me.  Food's included, but the price of the bath
511 will be extra.  More if you want the water hot, alot more if you want it clean.
512 So, what'll it be," the Innkeeper's voice was gruff, pressing a bravado that
513 may with all assuridness be backed up.
514 "The price is fair.  I do not know how long I may require the room, so please 
515 allow me to pay in advance, with this."  Shim Jitsu gave the Innkeeper a double
516 gold Mark.  It would be enough for quite some time.

535 In Australia You get your name in the paper under the column
536 "He's drunk and in jail."
537 In Malaysia the driver is jailed, and if married the spouse is too.
538 In United Kingdom, Finland, and Sweden you get put in the slammer 
539 automatically for a year.
540 In Turkey they drive you 20 miles out of town and let you walk back.
541 In Bulgaria a second offense and they put you under (six feet under).
542 And in ElSalvador, you just better not get caught, it's execution by
543 firing squad on the first offense.
544 Now that's a tough law!

547 Clean bath water... and hot, too.  He had graciously declined the offer of 
548 female companionship, though she had been lovely, because he needed the time to
549 think, and he always thought best in a hot bath.  He first rinsed himself in a 
550 basin of water beside the tub before entering the water.  When he was ready
551 for entering the bath, he stepped carefully into the water.  The water was very
552 hot.  He lowered into the water slowly, pausing as the members of his manhood 
553 entered.  He raised up just a little, and then settled himself in, the heet of 
554 the water reaching in passed the dirt, passed even his body, all the way to 
555 his soul.  When he awoke, he knew not if he had thought, but he 
556 wonderfully.  He had trouble loosing the smile from his face, until he thought

614 	Using all of the small skill he had with the sail, Grann carefully
615 coaxed the Razor's Edge past the shallows of the swift stream.  The horizon
616 churned with a brilliant display of hues ranging from the brightest violet
617 to the dullest red.  The wind began to increase in velocity, but the sudden
618 wind shifts did not aid them in their course.
619 	"It's getting too close!" yelled Grann over the rising wind.
620 "We'll never make Celene at this rate!"
621 	Morwin gestured behind the craft.  "The Eddy is catching up?"  He
622 smiled, then continued, "No longer."
623 	A smile remained on his face as the mage bean a ritual Grann had
624 never seen before.  Morwin began with his hands together, and brought them
625 slowly apart.  Small crackles of energy grew between them, and a form
626 flitted out of the small gap.
627 	The being had scarlet skin, a small whip-like tail, and a face that
628 clearly displayed fear of its summoner.  Instantly, it squeaked, "What is
629 your bidding, master?"
630 	"Produce a strong wind to propel this vessel northward, mite."
631 	Th imp squealed, "Instantly, sire!" and was gone in a blink.  A
632 moment later, the breeze freshened and the Razor cut through the water at a
633 renewed pace.  In moments, the water gave way to ether.  The Eddy slowly
634 ceased to advance toward the Razor, but still stubbornly followed.
635 	This portion of ether was not known to Grann.  The route to follow
636 was clear enough, albeit treacherous.  Small whirlpools caused the gnome
637 to choose a less direct route than he would have liked.  The 'keerin leapt
638 playfully in and out of the ether about them as the craft made its way
639 nearer the port it knew best.
640 	As Grann piloted the Razor about a rather large island of what
641 Milchar had once described as "solid ether", a tremendously powerful current
642 diverted the craft a bit too near a large whirlpool.  Try as they might,
643 neither gnome nor mage could prevent the Razor from being swept in and down
644 to elsewhere...

660  and to begin a period of fasting.  oday, he would go down stairs for food,
661 sit back, and watch.  He doubted in his heart, that the dark ones were near, 
662 but, by tching and listening, he hoped he would be aware if they were.
663 Opening the door to his room, he heard the voices in the Inn.  A few were loud,
664 but all had the bosterous bravado of friends having a good time.  Shim Jitzu

709    It's a quiet place here.  Nothing but the sound of a stream in the back
710  of my mind.  Occasionally I hear the sound of a fish jump out of the water.
711  It feels as though all time has stopped.  As I open my eyes I can see only
712  a heavy mist all around me.  Slowly memories begin to flood thru my mind as
713  though they happened only yesterday, the day I won my first equitation class,
714  the day my brother tried to drown me in the swimming pool, and many other
715  things.  Time seemed to fly by.  Faster and faster the scenes of my childhood
716  went through my mind.  Then, slowly the rate of speed lessened and then all
717  together stopped, and all went dark.  Cautiously I walked through the dark-
718  ness, alone and frightened.  A faint read light seemed to glow in the distance
719  I headed for it hoping for some sign of life.  As I got closer the light
720  seemed to dissipate and a shape took form.  There, in front of me, stood a
721  large ornate gate.  Something that may have come out of old England.  I reache
722  out to touch it expecting to feel cold iron but to my surprise it was warm
723  to the touch.  All at once it opened and I felt the compelling urge to step
724  thru to whatever may be on the other side.  After doing so the gate vanished
725  and another appeared before me.  This repeated it's self many more times.
726  Each time getting faster and faster until there was just a red blur.  My
727  head began to spin giving me an off balanced feeling.  Then, quickly as
728  everything started,  everything STOPPED!..........
729            In front of me stood one last gate.  This one was different from
730  the rest of them. It was very plain and simple and felt cold to my touch.
731  Looking through the bars was not darkness as before.  This time the gate
732  opened to a meadow.  A beautiful green meadow with wild flowers of every
733  color and lovely large trees for shade.  A small path lead down the hill
734  thru the field.  Following the path I had the care free feeling of being a
735  child again.  Looking down at my feet I saw I was barefoot, not wearing the
736  tennis shoes I know I had put on my feet this morning when I got dressed.
737  As I gave myself a quicky inspection I found my jeans and t-shirt from this
738  morning were replaced by a long shirt like dress with a cotton cord tied
739  loosely around my waist.  My hair was jet black and thick and reached far
740  below my waist.
741       In the distance I can hear someone calling "Melisa".  I feel as though I
742  should answer.  Instead I aimed for a nearby tree to hide, waiting to see who
743  called my name.  Wait a minute now I am claiming it as MY name.  Soon the
744  figure attached to the voice came into view.  It's a large burly man with a
745  heavy beard.   As he comes closer I see a stern face but as he comes more into
746  focus his eyes show worry and concern.  Suddenly his voice booms my name
747  across the meadow along with the words "I have no time for games.  We have
748  problems at home and we must get there now."  Tears began to well up in my
749  eyes as thoughts of an elderly woman came to me.  At this I stepped out from
750  my tree yelling  "I'm here father" and with all the energy I can muster run
751  to his arms.  As I approach he drops to one knee holding out his arms.  When
752  I reach him he holds me tightly yet gently in his arms.  His eyes are soft
753  and caring.  I kiss him softly on the cheek and hug him as tightly as a
754  six year old can.  When he stands I realize how very large he is, as I only
755  come to his waist.  I take his large weather beaten hand in mine and we start
756  for home.
757      "What's the trouble father?"  "The goats have broken out again and I
758  need your help to call them back".  "That should be easy father they like
759  me,  I always bring them goodies.  They will come to me, I know they will."
760  " I hope so your mother is sick with worry that she won't be able to get
761  them milked intime for morning market,  and you know how important it is
762  for us to have the money they bring us."  "Yes father".
763      We hadn't walked far when a small cottage came into view.  In front
764  stood a robust woman with a deep voice shouting something about "MY HOUSE!"
765  and "THOSE DAMN GOATS OF YOURS!!" the rest I couldn't quite understand.
766  She seemed to be beating on something, but again I couldn't quite make
767  it out.  As we got closer the whole picture became quite clear.   There was
768  mother trying to beat off 4 goats at once that were making an afternoon
769  snack of her garden and one inparticular was making a meal of her dress.
770  Needless to say who was getting the beating.  I did all I could to keep from
771  laughing,  even father was having trouble hiding a smile.  "Father I thought
772  you said she was upset because she couldn't find them?"  "Well that was
773  the situation when I left here to find you."  "Well I think I agree with
774  the upset part but I'm not so sure she is worried.  It is more likely she
775  is deciding how she plans on cooking them for our dinner tonight."
776  "Well if we don't get in there and help your mother she is going to cook
777  the two of us with them."  "Father,  I can help mother, I think you better
778  go see how much damage there is to the goat pen.....

802 The Philosopher sat at a table, strong drink in hand, and tried to
803 forget the unpleasant and bizarre things that had happened in
804 recent weeks.  It had all started two months ago.  He had been
805 sitting at his usual table at the Inn, trying to decide if he
806 should join the others in trying to find the Dancer and inquire as
807 to how and why she was wearing clothing previously worn by an old
808 woman, when he suddenly noticed that the other patrons were gone.
809 Almost simultaneous with this discovery, the Inn began to shake.
810 Glasses fell over, rolled off tables, and smashed themselves to
811 bits on the floor.  The strong vibrations caused the tables and
812 chairs to start meandering across the floor.  The Philosopher
813 wasn't quite sure just what was going on, but he was sure he didn't
814 want to stick around to see what would happen next.  He got
815 unsteadily to his feet and made his way to the door.  The trip took
816 much longer than it normally would because he kept losing his
817 footing, but at last he reached it.
818      He tried to push the door open, only to discover that the
819 earthquake, at least that what he had thought it was, had caused
820 the door to jam.  After throwing himself at the door several times
821 in a frantic attempt to force it open, he decided to try a
822 different means of escape.  He checked quickly through the pockets
823 of his robe, trying to locate his chalk.  He had almost given up in
824 despair when he finally found it.  Grasping it in a white knuckled
825 hand, he drew a rather hasty copy of the Symbol and quickly said
826 the words of teleportation.  As soon as area inside the symbol had
827 changed, the Philosopher stepped in and disappeared from the Inn.

902 pausing with a CTRL-S.  Since you seem to be having problems, try switching
903 terminals/ terminal programs.

905 Milchar: Some software/hardware (for instance, TELCOM on the 100) has the nasty
906 habit of stopping the display of incoming data as soon as you hit ^S and not
907 resuming display until you send a ^Q *even if the remote system resumes
908 transmission* (All together now... ARRGGGGHHHH!!!!!!)

930 thus this msg. 
931 Do you have a C compiler that can produce code that will run on a M3 or M4?
932 I've gotten a wonderful game from comp.sources.games, but I'd like to be able
933 to play it on my machine as opposed to bucket... (I really don't wanna xlate
934 it to BASIC, Z-80 asm, FORTRAN, or Alcor Pascal)

944 I know that this is a little frowned upon, but I feel that it is O.K., as this 
945 announcement is for something mind stimulating at least.
946    I will sone be running two different types of Role-Playing Games over on
947 the ARTESIAN LABS BBS - 625-xxxx.  One
948 of the two games will be Fantasy Medieval type, and the other will be a 
949 Super-Hero's type game.  I need EIGHT   players per game.  I hope to be 
950 starting the Medieval game around Aug.1, and the superhero game around Aug 15. 
951 If interested, call me at 775-xxxx mornings between 10 and 12 noon, or evenings
952 after 5pm untill 11pm.  If I am not home, leave your name and phone#, and a 
953 time to call you.  Thanks for your indulgence, but this is one of my favorite

958    Shim Jitzu awoke early, as was his common practice.  He did his morning 
959 rituals, and the headed for the temple of Na'ga.  As he stepped out of the Inn,
960 he attuned his mind to the temple, a skill that was common to all of the
961 warrior-priests of Na'ga.  He found the temple in his mind, a calm place made 
962  
963  
964 calmer by the morning.  He started out for the city, a few miles away yet, for,
965 that is where the temple lie.  It was quiet on the road, with only an occasion-
966 al field mouse or bird disturbing the tranquillity at all.  Shim Jitzu new that
967 it would not be so, long...

985 is there something wrong?  If I held down my control key, I could read what was
