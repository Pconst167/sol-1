21      I ached, oh how my body ached.  With a groan I opened my 
22 eyes.  I was greeted with the garish light of a bare bulb. 
23 Sitting up on the edge of the hard shelf that served as a bed, I 
24 groaned once more. My head felt as if a thousand Leprechauns 
25 were dancing out their joyous humor on it.  I then heard a 
26 slight snicker.  Looking up, I saw that I had been incarcerated 
27 in the same cell as Pam.  "So, you think it's funny do you?  No 
28 doubt you are feeling no better then I, so I wouldn't laugh to 
29 hard if I were you.  But, be that as it may, may I ask for what 
30 reason have you been brought here, and why am I locked in this 
31 cell with you?"  I received no real answer, only a shrug of the 
32 shoulder, and then quickly grabed at the remains of her blouse 
33 as it slipped down her shoulder.  I quickly looked aside, not 
34 wishing to embaress her.  So, I guess I'll have to put up with 
35 your silence eh?  Getting up, I went over to the barred window 
36 to look out.  There was nothing to see outside but more walls, 
37 and an overcast sky.  Turning back I saw that Pam was busy 
38 repairing the remains of her blouse with a hairpin. "So, you're 
39 not going to say anything huh?"  With a sigh, I sat back down 
40 and sat with my head in my hands.  A time later, I heard a key 
41 rattle in the cell door, moments later to be greeted by a 
42 toothless smile, and a horrid little laugh.  Oh no, not again..

52 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (what have we done?)
53 I don't believe it, in the time that I have been here, the mood
54 has turned and has been caught on the bottom of the cycle.
55 
56 The prevelance of woe has us trapped, and we will not let go for
57 we enjoy lamenting in our miseries.
58 
59 Harlequin, "knife-wielder":  We have begun to spin the yarns that
60 are The Truth, and see where it has lead us?  They are things we
61 felt just *had* to be said.  Please my friends, let us once again
62 return to the lighter times and partake in a fantasy that is not
63 burdened with the sorrow or the doubt that follows those Thruths.
64 Bysitter:  How painfully correct...  We see others in pain and wish
65 to be of some assistance while we do not see those beside us go
66 without.  Something about 'the forest from the trees'?
67 
68 But what is not seen is the humor that is shared -away- from the
69 boards.  Jokes and pleasant conversaition abounded.  No, all these
70 people are not as hurt as they seem for this is only their dark 
71 closet, a place to shake off unwanted sorrow.            Or is it?
72 ^^^^^lightenup!^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     --->the Guardian     140:15**
73 
74 
75 /|\ So what is it asked? Those things that we think are too painful to be
76 divulged in the presence of our dearest friends cannot even be spoken here.
77 A comfort that has been found is lost. Those things inside that we are afraid
78 of should not be expressed? We should keep them locked up, further chained?
79 It is a sad thought. Denouncing the freedom once had is a difficult task.
80 Yes. These words are sorrowful. And a pain to read. I shall attempt to
81 re-paste the fake smile I had come to drop. As I see it is unwanted and
82 gives depression. I did not mean for this. I only longed for the expression
83 I cannot seem to hold elsewhere. Sorry if I caused uncomfort. I will try to
84 let my eyes glaze revealing nothing of my true thoughts. Yes. I long for
85 happiness. It is my quest. But falseness is not. It will take me a day or
86 two to become comfortable in the new face. Fret not. After that the
87 security of it will return. And I will rather show off feigned emotions
88 instead of true ones. It is less painful that way, despite all it lacks. /|\
89 is anyone out there ..... hello
90 what is all this jibber-ish i'm seeing on the screen, i
91 s it suppose to make sense?????????

96     Many moons ago I came to this place with my 
97 people, we needed a new planet to colonize.
98 After many eons of existance, we were met by
99 a new race of beings, ones who meant our 
100 destruction. So we.....

103 /|\, I hope that you do not take the Guardians words as they might be on first 
104 reading.  It is not that soul-cleansing is not welcome, for I myself have bathed
105 may a time in the cool waters that this Inn provides.  Now is one of those 
106 times.  I seems that many of us have had the need lately, and we all know that
107 there are times that friends and family cannot fill the holes that life wears
108 in the fabric of our existance.  
109   This is a place of joy, with its smiles and friendship.  But also this is a 
110 place of healing, with pain and loneliness.  To often we are required by the 
111 real world to wear false faces, here live the masks that speak our hearts.
112   Guardian, do not worry about the dark color of the words as of late.  The 
113 river (and time) moves slowly but consistantly, bringing fresh water.
114 [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] [/] THE TIN MAN [/] [/]
115 
116 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (and the river will flow)
117 Tin Man,  I often forget that others do not see me as those that have come to 
118      know me do.  I sometimes hide too well the cynical bite that is hidden in
119      my words.  They do not show the hint of dismay that lurks behind every
120      other word...  Always the entendres that are missed.
121      I too have been shring a great deal of my grief with all of you, but have
122      hidden them behind other names while longing for both recognition and
123      anonimity.  Shocking would be my new unveilings.  Thank you for your
124      understanding.
125 /:\  You will not be forgotten.  I have spoken with one that hides in the 
126      shadows, and have been given the words that befit you so well.  The basic
127      concept of our conversation brought to light the idea that 'even though
128      the words themselves may be of the depressive nature, we still long to 
129      hear the words greatly.'  It is not out of maliciousness, but out of true
130      concern...  (PaPa needs the term for business.   Ciao...)
131 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     --->the Guardian     141:02
132 
133      Speaking of PaPa, I think we might be getting along a little better now.
134 It's so difficult to communicate to someone when your lifestyles have shifted
135 completely out of phase.  Little is the time we have to even say 'hello'.
136 His words here meant a great deal to me; they were a hand reaching out in the
137 dark.  And by God, I'll grab that hand!  Hmmm...  I don't seem to recall the
138 bad times anymore, just the good times shared.   <Whew, what a relief!>
139      So don't think we don't want to share this burden with you, we will if 
140 you allow us.  It was just that I felt my need for crying in the crowd has
141 passed for the time being.  (How about you Tin Man?)  If you still hurt, don't
142 block the tears that would flow as a river lest you drown from their cumulative
143 hardships.  Let them flow, share the waters, spread the Back Waters...
144 In one form or another, there will always be

148 HELLO AGAIN...
149 I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE, (WHAT ELSE IS NEW?) BUT I DON'T LIKE
150 IT. DEPRESSION IS INFECTUIOUS AND I'M STARTING TO FEEL INFECTED. I, MYSELF,
151 COULD ADD A FEW WORDS HERE ABOUT PAIN. BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE THE POINT 
152 (FOR ME, ANYWAY) I JUST TRY TO DIRECT MY ENERGIES TOWARD TO MORE POSITIVE
153 ASPECTS OF MY LIFE AND THE PAIN SEEMS TO BA A LITE LESS. I TOOK A COUPLE
154 OF PRETTY HEAVY PERSONAL BLOWS EARLY THIS MONTH BUT I SEEM TO BE DRAGGING 
155 MYSELF OUT OF THIS HOLE I PUT MYSELF IN. LIFE'S A BUMMER, 'TIS TRUE, BUT I
156 ABSOLUTELY REFUSE TO LET IT GET TO ME. IF SOMETHING BLOWS UP IN MY FACE,
157 I'LL TRY TO COMPENSATE FOR IT IN OTHER WAYS. IT'S HARD AT FIRST, I KNOW,
158 BUT I FIND IT GETS EASIER AS TIME GOES BY. THE SAME MIGHT WORK FOR YOU.
159 OR MAYBE I'M JUST STRANGE. I REFUSE TO THINK ABOUT IT. THERE'S A HUNK OF
160 STEEL SITTING IN MY DRESSER DRAWER THAT I HAVE NO INTENTION OF VIEWING
161 FROM THE FRONT, EXCEPT WHEN I'M CLEANING IT.
162 ANYWAY, ENOUGH OF MY CRAP. LET'S GET TO BUSINESS.

164 UNDERCOVER (Conclusion)
165 by John Silverman
166 
167 At his own insistance, Frank walked out unaided. The arm and head wounds
168 they let him. His muscles felt like rubber but the act of just trying 
169 seemed to make them stronger. He went through the fire door (which was now
170 eight feet in diameter) and out. The raw sunlight that hit him almost made
171 him faint but he was caught by a medic who was standing by. Frank didn't
172 protest as they put him on a stretcher and lifted him into the waiting
173 ambulance. The medic climbed in and they closed the doors. He decided not 
174 to tell Frank that he was the only survivor of the worst massacre in modern
175 U.S. history. The news would make headlines around the world tomorrow, to
176 shock people reading them safe in their homes. Frank would probably be 
177 pestered by reporters for a week at least. Right now, though, what the guy 
178 needed was rest. Frank had closed his eyes and appeared to be sleeping
179 peacefully.
180 
181 He was back in the cart, surrounded by his dead co-workers. Bright blood 
182 glistened on their mangled uniforms. They held him down while Chuck took a 
183 blood drenched pillow and put it over Frank's face. He was helpless. He 
184 was smothering. And they were laughing, laughing...
185 
186 Frank jerked awake. The ambulance was moving, siren screaming. The medic 
187 had a hand on his shoulder, trying to soothe him.
188 
189 "Hey, calm down, calm down. It's over, buddy. It's all over."
190 
191 Frank laid back down but kept his eyes open. Over?
192 
193 In his mind it would never be over.
194 
195 The End
196 
197 BYE, BYE, FRANK. HAVE A NICE LIFE. AND NOW, I SHALL GO INTO PASSIVE LURK
198 MODE WHILE I THINK UP A NEW ONE. THANKS LOTS FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT. I WANT
199 TO START A STORY OVER AT TANIS OT A.W. BUT NEVER FEAR, I WILL BE HERE, AND
200 I WILL BE BACK ON THE AIR AS SOON AS I HAVE SOMETHING INTELLIGENT TO WRITE
201 (UNLIKE MY PRELUDE TONIGHT). YOU ALL TAKE CARE AND DON'T LET IT GET YOU 
202 DOWN TOO MUCH AND I BE AROUND.
203 BYE...

211   After a long silence, the piper rose and went outside.  The afternoon
212 sun bathed his face in warmth as he rounded the corner of the inn, heading
213 back to the stables.  He did not even notice the animal scent of the stables
214 as he walked in the open door.  In the dark interior all was quiet save the
215 frantic bumbling of a bluebottle fly droning its rounds from dungheap to 
216 pile.  Entering an empty stall, the piper crouched and picked up an object
217 from the stall's floor, then turned and walked back out into the bright-lit
218 afternoon.  He walked for a few minutes into the woods, following no 
219 particular path, then sat in a patch of sunlight near the base of a large
220 tree.  He sat for a few moments, then dropped his face into his hands and
221 wept.  Unnoticed, the feather that he carried spun down from his fingers
222 and landed on a patch of emerald-green moss where it lay in perfect display
223 -- the pure white of the feathers given golden overtones by the afternoon
224 sun, the clump of hair growing from the feather's shaft looking like some
225 strange object created by an infinitely skilled craftsman.

230 People react to emotional pain in many ways,
231 some simply refuse to accept delivery. Yet
232 for others, the pain is something that has
233 developed deep inside. For them to hold it
234 in, to denie its existance is not good. 
235 It is a canker that eats at their sole. They
236 must find a way to release the pain before
237 the damage done is too great. The tearful
238 release is good, not bad. It allows them to
239 release the pain, to let it fly free so that
240 they can get on with their lives. Yes, it
241 is depressing for a while, but the end result
242 is even greater joy, for the wound has been
243 allowed to heal, and the pain is silenced.
244 For some, repression is the worst thing to do.

252 
253  A tiny spark of incandescence explodes in the night,
254        It shines with all the fire of my heart.
255        What is this power that draws me so near?
256          What magic engulfs me by this light?
257 
258   Its blinding brilliance has shattered the darkness.
259 That darkness I had drawn as a cloak to hide my fears. 
260 
261            The old fears rise in my throat, 
262     The burning and blackened scars begin to throb.
263   Yet a power beyond my control draws me towards it,
264       And I am bathed in the cool white radiance.
265      It washes away my fears, and sooths the hurt.
266 
267    I open my hands as I open my heart to this spark,
268                 this flame deep within.
269     An acceptance of being and love fills my heart,
270        As the brilliance alights and enfolds me.
271               Yet I dare not hold tight,  
272        For to capture would shut out the light. 
273     And once again would I be lonly in my darkness. 
274 
275      Now I fear the dark even more then the light,
276        I only need try to hold tighly the light.  
277     And I shall loose that which I so dearly love.
278 
279 Oh firefly, dear firefly, I can only give you my love. 
280           Never would I attempt to cage you. 
281           You have brought light to my life, 
282                 And healed old wounds. 
283     With the light of your love that surrounds me.
284 
285       Though the scars remain, the hurt is gone,
286       And the blackness is replaced by the dawn.
287       My life is renewed, the light has returned. 
288 
289   I am as a phoenix arisen from the ashes of my past.

296      "I need a smaller screwdriver! Get me the smaller one, will you?"
297 The man was quite small for his age but he knew what he was doing when
298 it came to electronics and AI. "Where is that 'driver, for gosh darn?"
299      "Hold on to your breeches Paul, it's coming, it's coming..." Ralph.
300 "How long is it going to be for you to re-calibrate that synthesizer
301 anyway? The forman makes a joke and you take him seriously... Really!"
302      "Just give it to me, ok? I won't be much longer. It's not as easy
303 as it looks, you know. I've got to reset the durations on certain areas
304 as well as the pitch if I'm going to make it sound believable." Paul
305 reached for the inner mechanisms that were hidden between the back seat
306 and the data unit that was in the trunk. "Just give me a little more
307 light and I should be finished with this part of it.  Ah, er, um...
308 Yup, that does it. The voice has been completly altered. All we have to
309 do is flick a switch and presto! The old becomes the new!" Paul wiggled
310 his way back out and returned the screwdrivers to Ralph. Ralph just 
311 stood there with his open mouth, a sign of his mentality.
312      "Gosh Paul, you never fail to amaze me."
313      "That's why I get paid more than you do."
314      "Huh?" A major portion of Ralph's vocabulary.
315      "Never mind. Just get over here."
316      "Yeeea, right... Whatever you say."
317 Ralph followed behind Paul as he went to the trunk to contend with the
318 next segment of the 'operation'. Being more of a programmer than a 
319 toaster repairman, this part went along with fewer commercial 
320 interuptions.
321      "Hand me that probe... no, that one. I need to make sure that this
322 is all aligned correctly before I start to make the alterations here as
323 well. Now that it sounds different, I'm going to make it think 
324 differently as well." Paul gave a devilish chuckle under his breath.
325 "Yup, once this puppy is back on the road, we're going to have some fun/"
326      "Paul, the forman wants to know if we should rebroadcast that
327 announcement again yet. How's it coming?" Ralph was biginning to head 
328 back to the forman's office with the reply.
329      "Go ahead with the broadcast, this shouldn't take me much longer."
330

388 eyebal.  Some I haven't seen in a while and some I might never have 'seen'.
389       My comm mode in realtime doesn't always work all that well so most of you
390 probably don't realize that I feel that way.  I suppose the presence of each
391 other might be too painful for some but
392 there's getting to be not so many of us showing up at the saturday multiplex-
393 ings.
394       Is it alright to like a few people, and everybody, AND my solitude.
395       There are realms ware the air is sweet.  friends, inner happiness, w/o
396 mucking about in the dregs, or pasted-on false hilarity.

401 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (life, the revolving door, and you)
402 - TJ///,  You know, I really wish the job I had provided me with some REAL 
403     hours off.  That way I could be around when you and the other have your
404     little chats.  I just wish that I had some time available to discuss these
405     things with you.
406 Isn't it odd when you seem to be ahead of the crowd?  I'm on my (believe it or
407 not) up-cycle just as the rest of the world is heading for their downward half.
408 How can I express a part of the joy that I know feel?  I guess it is true that
409 poetry and the like is alot easier when in a blue mood, buyt there's gotta be a
410 way to pass on the glee as well.  Ok, maybe not glee, but I am feeling better
411 than just a couple of days ago.
412 /|\  (Well, there goes the glee)  I don't know.  You say to look, but I don't
413      know where.  Real names flash in my mind, but who?  Maybe you are the one
414      that has told me "No I'm not".  Maybe you are the one from the shadows 
415      with whom I spoke.  Maybe you are the one I sent the timepiece message to.
416      Maybe you are the one that asked for a friend to join them on some far
417      away, improvised escape from the city.  But all I see are words that want
418      to be familiar, but aren't.  From you  I see not a face, but only green 
419      letters.  The public forum is never the best way to clear these matters up
420      while maintaining the facade.
421        But keep the facade, it is something we would all enjoy.  I reclude in 
422      mine, and you in yours.  Some don't even talk to me for they say I am 
423      one not to be trusted, that I am nothing but a spy.  Alas, not so...
424        They fear that I am not who they may longer call
425 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     --->the Guardian     142:06

433 Not quite asleep
434 Just lying on
435 Smooth sheets
436 Eyes wide
437 Letting in 
438 Only dark

440 A cool night
441 Washes over
442 Smooth sheets
443 It touches
444 A memory
445 And I stir
446 
447 My hand reaches
448 Finding only
449 Smooth sheets
450 No impression
451 No depression
452 Just empty

454 I get up 
455 Fluff pillows
456 Smooth sheets
457 Find towels
458 Shower alone
459 Another day

461 The clock ticks
462 So slowly
463 Smooth sheets
464 Stay smooth

466 Without you

469 Guardian--> It is hard to talk of such things, even with others we trust so
470 highly. And with respect comes trust, no doubt? So you must understand that even
471 though I highly respect and trust you, as well as the other and others, I cannot
472 seem to find the words to open my internal struggle to the rest. Maybe soon I'll
473 find a way... - TJ///

494   Weeping is for some a catharasis.  It burns out the pain and quenches the
495 coals with the tears.  For others it seems to have no real purpose other than
496 display -- some form of coercing others into acknowledgement of their feelings.
497    The piper had not worried about others -- he sought solitude for his
498 emotional pain, just as a wounded animal seeks solitude to heal physical
499 wounds.  Humans have a unique capability -- emotional exhaustion.  After
500 several hours, the piper collapsed into a deep sleep.  A small grey
501 squirrel inched its nervous way down a nearby tree, and with nervous jerks
502 worked its way near the piper.  A spasm twisted the piper's body and sent
503 the small animal in a panic up the tree while the piper's face twisted
504 with the intensity of his dream.

507 L'homme: Sounds great, glad to hear you have been having fun with CL.
508 I'm very interested in the results of using it with EDT, since that
509 is a rather common usage when running on DEC equipment. Have you tried
510 it on the PCjr yet? (I know, who cares? IBM doesn't!)

527 Guardian: I like your dating system.  I was wondering about it when I stumbled

532   So we went to ask the Elder what to do about
533 these invaders. He thought long and hard until
534 he told us of a secret power my people had millions
535 of years ago, which was abolished because of
536 its terrible consequences on our people. The Elder
537 informed us that re-gaining this power was the only way
538 to rid ourselves of this new foe. So, the Elder began
539 his research right away to find all that he could
540 on our ancient power. After five long weeks, we were
541 being wiped out by the invaders and the Elder finally found
542 a way to regain our ancient powers, but it would take
543 a long tedious training period for the chosen few to get
544 this awsome power. The trainees were chosen, 5 of them,.....

550 THIS IS BIZARRE, WHAT IN THE WORLD DOES THIS ACCOMPLISH FOR ANYONE???
551 as the mugger patiently waited for another victem in the park late that night an
552 an inoscent old lady, on her way home from the post office, decided to take a
553 shortcut through the park.  Little did sshe know of the terror awaiting her.
554 As the old lady exited the underpass the mugger saw an opertunity to make a 
555 score and a few bucks.  Slowly he stealthed his victom, the moonlight glistned
556 off of his axe.  With lightning speed he struck, but the old lady, knowing of
557 the dangers, pulled out her .44 magnum and said "go ahead, make my day."
558 Needless to say he did make her day.
