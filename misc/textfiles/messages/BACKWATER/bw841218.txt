53  Dune. What can one say, walking from the theater, visually stunned, but knowing
54 deep in your heart a classic fiction book was massacred at the hands of a
55 director known best for his phallic adolescent in Eraserhead, and a producer
56 who knows no bounds to the word garish.
57  A movie that tried to be all things to all people. A movie that attempted to
58 please the millions of followers of Frank Herbert's fictional worlds, and at
59 the same time cater to the other unenlightened millions who will truly
60 determine whether this movie sinks or swims at the box office.
61  In an attempt to make a comprehensible movie for those unlucky souls who have
62 not had the privilege of experiencing Dune in print, the makers of this
63 film have resorted to short sighted tools to move the story along at a
64 speed not exceeding the sensory input level of its audience.
65  Too many things were changed. Too many characters were altered. Too many
66 scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. A book that needed no help was
67 instead helped beyond the stage of common sense and literary decency. People
68 familiar with Dune will cringe at the Weirding modules, the handling of Keynes,
69 Paul's trial with the Water of Life, the complete idiocy of the Baron, and
70 the incredibly bad characterizations of the emperor, Thufir Hawat, and
71 the Fremen Chani.
72  With all of its shortcomings to the loyal, the movie accomplishes many things
73 in its 2 hour 5 minute run. The very commendable handling of The Voice; the
74 characterizations of the Bene Gesserit witches, Jessica in particular; and
75 the rest of the Attredies household, minor changes from the book not-
76 withstanding; the prescience sequences; the thought processes; the sound, and
77 the cinematography are all excellent.
78  Readers of Dune will have to be satisfied with the imagery of the film. 
79 Decisions were made that are often beyond the control of even the most
80 well-meaning film maker. Dune is yet another testament to the foul treatment
81 novels are given in Hollywood. Rejoice in what is left, and perhaps, try to
82 think of Dune as a different story from a different book. Keep those memories
83 of the real Dune close to the heart, and never forget them.

119      And indeed strange things have happened to Leo since the recent brawl
120 in the control room.    1. The arcing effect disrupted the controllers 
121 power over captive humans and Inmo's.  2.  The yuglies are sort of disini-
122 grated, leaving somewhat slimy puddles of yellowish fur and fats.  3. Ontho
123 forgave Leo for being a twit.  3. Transportion was arranged for wandering
124 and cold children and Inmo's back to friends and home's.  4. Even though
125 the defeat of the Yuglies came by accident, Leo was rewarded with a wet
126 kiss from the young duke and a spaceship.  5. Ontho worked with the elders
127 to devise a box to properly house the trident and came up with a workable
128 solution.   6.  Alex (young duke) and Leo are now on their own, they have
129 new adventures waiting on their new ship, the great Guaran. The Trident
130 is at the bow of the ship in the new chest designed by Ontho and the Others
131      Ontho was sitting on the head of the old woman when Leo and Alex left
132 the lanch pad.  The little Inmo was thinking of upcomming events soon to 
133 end *his* life. Just to smart for an Inmo to handle.  The old woman reading
134 Ontho's thoughts sent back a warm message of love and thanks for a job done
135 well.

139     The seas were calm now as Salty looked out over the water. Had been a
140 terrible storm last night but the crew handled it like the men they were.
141 And such good men they were.  "Ship starboard" cried the lookout in the
142 crows nest. Salty got out his scope for a look.  A fine English merchant
143 ship could be seen. Salty started to fantasize, gold, silver, guns.. who
144 knows untill it's boarded. "Men!!!" he cried "load the cannons!!, Weve got
145 work to do"
146      The men were as happy to see the ship as their boss, and gleefully
147 loaded the cannons and sharped swords, their guns were loaded and ready.
148 steady as she goes. The men loved this part, for they had stolen their
149 fine cannons from a Spanish galleon before they sent her to the bottom.
150 Salty was up on the top deck looking at the faces of the men on the ship
151 they were attacking. For they had seen the jolly rodger and were doing 
152 their best to escape.  "Ha Ha" "look at them try to run" Salty was pleased

155   SO, NOW I HAVE SEEN DUNE, AND I SEEM TO BE IN THE COMPANY OF A GOOD MANY OTHER PEOPLE. FILM FAN DID, AND PROCEEDED TO WHINE
156 ABOUT THE HISTORY OF IT'S MAKERS, AND I RECEIVED A SMALL LESSON IN ARRAKIAN SPELLING PATTERNS FOR HIS TROUBLE.
157   I HAVE NOT READ DUNE, I TRIED BUT THE LACK OF IMAGERY THAT I RECEIVED FROM HERBERT'S WRITING STYLE MADE ME TIRE OF IT TOO
158 QUICKLY. SADLY, I ONLY READ TO PAGE THIRTY TWO OR SO.
159 
160   THE MOVIE DUNE RELIES A BIT MUCH ON GORE, AND DISGUST TO ENFORCE OPINIONS ON CERTAIN CHARACTERS. THE BARON HAS NO CHARACTER
161 DEVOLOPMENT WITHOUT HIS DISGUSTING APPEARENCE, AND MANNER.
162 
163   THE CUTTER MADE THIS AWESOME SPECTACLE OF A MOVIE, A SHAMBLES OF WHAT THE FILM WAS SHOT TO BE. NOT BECAUSE OF PARTS LEFT OUT
164 REALLY, BUT BECAUSE THE CUTTER DID A THIRD RATE JOB. SOME SCENES WERE SO SCRATCHED UP THAT IT APPEARED ON THE AUDIO TAPE.
165   THE END IS SO... ANTICLIMACTIC THAT ANY TREMENDOUS WELLING OF PRIDE AFTER THE MOVIE IS SILENCED BY ONE SHOT THAT WAS HANDLED
166 HIDEOUSLY.
167 
168   PERHAPS THIS WAS SIMPLY AT MY THEATER, BUT MY SHOWING SEEMED TO PORTRAY AN AWESOME SPECTACLE RUINED BY A HIRRENDOUS CUTTING
169 JOB. WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE OUGHT TO BE FIRED AT LEAST, AND PROBABLY SHAMED PROFESSIONALLY.
170 
171   OVERALL, WITH HIDEOUS CUTTING JOB ASIDE, DUNE SUCCEEDED IN BEING ENTHRALLING AND INTERESTING IN THE EXTREME. ALL OF THE SETS
172 AND PROPS, EVEN THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE HANDLED PERFECTLY FOR MY TASTES, AS I HAD NOT FORMED IRRESISTABLE IDEAS ON WHAT
173 PEOPLE AND PROPS AND SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE SUPPOSED TO LOOK AND SOUND LIKE. ANY CRITICISM ON THAT POINT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OUT
174 FOR THAT PREJUDICE.
175 
176   DUNE WAS A GREAT SAMPLER FOR THE READING OF DUNE. I AM ENTHRALLED... EVERY PART HAD SUCH PROMISE THAT I AM SURE I WILL ENJOY
177 THE READING OF DUNE.

203      Salty was pleased... His fine ship was currently in the process of
204 bombarding the English vessel. Taking a couple of hits but nothing to fret
205 about. Salty ordered the boarding and swung aboard himself knife in his
206 teeth to fight with his men.  Ah this is the life, plundering and looting,
207 shooting and killing, taking of treasures, trading old ships for new. Who
208 could ask for anymore? Ah yes I am a lucky man, said Salty to himself as he
209 knifed a english man who wasn't thrilled to death with Salty's idea's.
210      They rounded up about 15 men and 2 cabin boys, tied them up untill they
211 had their way with them.  Salty and his first mate, Salty calls him nosebleed,
212 were opening up the hold.  Nosebleed held a lamp and climbed down in.

227   The piper, growing weaker from the loss of blood, slowly realized from where
228 the blood was running.  A deep fear gripped him, as the feel of a second slash
229 tore across the same side, followed by another torrent of blood.  Unable to 
230 staunch a wound that had no source on his physical body, the piper staggered
231 from the path, heart aflame with fear for the pegasus, leaving his bloody
232 shirt marking his point of entry.  Not knowing where he was, not knowing where
233 he was heading, he stumbled blindly down the side of a small canyon, tearing
234 a thin, tall tree that had partly fallen over, out of the ground.  Grasping at
235 it to slow his fall, he felt the world dissolve from around him.
236   The timid woodland creatures were treated to an amazing sight that afternoon.
237 The spectacle of a large and clumsy two-legs who had previously suffered some
238 terrible wound, blundering down the side of the small, steeply-sloped canyon.
239 Not too terribly remarkable?  Ah, but the way he fell... twisting and turning,
240 yet not down the slope -- he seemed to fall in a completely different direction.

256 To the anonymous person complaining about 'cutting' as you so ignorantly called it. Your message demonstrates a real
257 lack of knowledge about how movies are made. How could you think for one moment one person was responsible for the
258 entire editing job on a film the scale of Dune? Do you think this is some simpleton procedure done in a hurry? Do you
259 think after spending millions of dollars on the making of a film, the makers would be unwilling to spend the same kind
260 of money to have the film edited properly. You mentioned something about the theater you watched the film at possibly
261 having something to do with the look of the film. This is highly unlikely, since films are distributed in a very orderly
262 manner, and prints, except for the differences between 70mm dolby and standard, are very much alike. Perhaps your frame
263 of mind had something to do with the unsatisfactory quality you felt your viewing of the film had? Nevertheless, Dune
264 was a technical achievement of the highest degree. I don't think there can be any quarrel with the quality of the 
265 'film'. You may argue, as FILM FAN has done (whining as you so call it) with the content of the film. You may dislike
266 what was chosen to remain in the film, and what was left out, but to complain about the look of the film, seems pointles
267 s at best. You state your dislike of Herbert's writing style at the beginning of your message, then you do a quick change
268 at the end. What gives? If you can't even keep one coherent line of reasoning through a short message, can we really
269 believe or trust anything you say?

304 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (I know)
305 Claiming ignorance to a good many facets of human emotions and wisdoms, I say
306 these things.     I am not one to go 'Ho Ho Ho', for I do not *feel* it. Words
307 of praise and emotion do not easily come from my lips, and because of this,
308 much of how some people 'read' my actions (unless they *really* know me) can
309 easily be mis-inetrpreted (sp!) Oh, I try, but something has happened...
310      I assume that most of the 'downers' at this time of year are holiday 
311 related and can be overcome by time, but time sure does have a way of slowing
312 down in these matters, doesn't it? I think so.
313      Tammy, although the following answer doesn't really give a clear solution
314 your dilema with your great writing, allow me to give you this...   If you have
315 another idea for a story, and it may not quite fit, save it or start another
316 story. If you would like to stop at where you are with Milo, at least it will
317 serve as a good background for his character in another story...   or change
318 the situation and keep the cahacter you have already deveoped.
319 Keep this in mind...  'There are many alternative paths for you to choose.'

373 asking if there was a reason why you could not (or did not want to) use your
374 ROMs for a TEST! I did not expect you to give up YOUR ROMs to fix HIS machine.
375 OK?

377 I HAD MY FIRST PREMONITION THAT DUNE WOULD BE BUTCHERED WHEN I SAW DINO
378 DE LAURENTIS NAME ON IT. (I HAVE A BAD MEMORY FOR MOVIE TRIVIA - COULD 
379 L'HOMME PERHAPS, OR SOMEONE ELSE REMIND ME OF WHAT DDL HAS EVER DONE RIGHT?)
380 THE SECOND SHOT OF FOREBODING HIT ME WHEN I GOT FOUR PEOPLE INTO DUNE FOR
381 6 BUCKS AND TWO FUN PACK COUPONS ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE PORTLAND OPENING.
382 ONE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE LITTLE VOICES, BUT I BADLY WANTED THE MOVIE 
383 TO SUCCEED, BECAUSE I LOVED THE BOOK (FIFTEEN YEARS AGO).
384     ANYHOW, SINCE MOST PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE FELT THE SAME WAY (SO I INTERPRET
385 THESE APOLOGISTS REMARKS), I WISH TO ADD A FEW EXPLANATIONS FOR THE DISATER MYSLF. 
386 1. PRESSURE TO FIT THE FILM INTO UNDER 2 1/2 HOUR FORMAT SO AS TO SELL IT TO
387 T.V. THIS WAS A *BIG* BOOK. THUS THE EXTREME EDITING (OR CUTTING, AS THE SLANG
388 USED TO BE) THAT KEPT US FLITTING FROM ONE SCENE TO ANOTHER, BARELY TOUCHING
389 ON ANY. HOWEVER A VERY MEDIOCRE DIRECTOR COULD HAVE HAD THE SAME EFFECT. I 
390 WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER WITH THIS BOOK SPLIT IN TWO OR THREE PARTS.
391 2. I DIDN'T THINK THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE ALL THAT GREAT. THE SCENES WITH THE
392 FREMEN RIDING THE GIANT WORMS REMINDED ME OF THOSE PHONY LOOKING DINOSAUR FILMS
393 OF THE FIFTYS. THERE WAS A LOT OF GREAT STUFF IN THERE TOO, NO DOUBT, BUT IT O
394 ONLY TAKES ONE BLOWN SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT TO RUIN THE 'WILLINGNESS TO SUSPEND
395 DISBELIEF. I THINK ABOUT 95% OF THESE WERE GREAT - AND THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
396 
397 3. HOW ABOUT LOSING DUNCAN HALFWAY THROUGH THE FILM?
398 4. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT? LIKE MAYBE IN PLACE OF THOSE MARTIA
399 MARTIAL ARTS TRAINING SCENES THAT REMINDED ME OF BRUCE LEE MOVIES - THE EARLY ON
400 ONES?
401 5. JOSE FERRER AS AN EMPORER? HOW ABOUT LASSIE AS THE QUEEN MOTHER, THEN?
402 -----BATPOOP, THE MAGNIFICENT, PORTLANDS ANSWER TO SISKEL AND EBERT ----------
403 Batpoop - a good DDL? CONAN. (the first, not that miserable The Destroyer).

406 Whenever a book is made into a movie, even if the book is followed faithfully,
407 it is an entirely different THING: different characters, different setting,
408 different action-from the book because most of that stuff is brought to the
409 book-experience by the reader. I am always startled by movie versions of books,
410 especially books I care about, and am usually disappointed. The thing on the
411 screen, no matter how well done, is not the thing that is dear to me. I did
412 like "French Lieutenant's Woman" where they did a severe modification of the
413 story line in the book (which had some severe modifications of its own) which
414 announced forthrightly "This is different; this is a movie, not the book you
415 read."  The emotional flavor of the author came across better in this not-so-
416 literal version.

423 for her, or whoevers name it is.   Go Tammy!,  Go Tammy!.

Lucky new user THERESA was at the top and noone bothered to mention it
430 to her.  Sham Sham.   THERESA, being the first user of line 19 is
431 an ice cream cone on a very hot day.   (ie. N-E-A-T)  and much sout after
432 
I was woundering about that SNODERGAARD guy and where he went, no wounder
433 I didn't find many references - The First Regeneration is at hand (I think
434 really I missed it).   I do wish he would wake up and rejoin the real world.
435 
That of course is our real world, and not the one he thinks he's in.  ha

439    Nosebleed shouts from below. "Hey, thars people down har, women!"
440 On deck Salty groans, "gawd, that's all we need is a bunch of silly
441 women, well bring them up."  Salty's crew has mixed emotions about 
442 the cargo, some like salty think it's time to dump garbage into the
443 sea to attract sharks.  In preparation for the joy of plank walking.
444 The pirate with the most kills gets to do the final pushing. Such fun!
445    On the other hand, or hook soom of the men have different idea's
446 about the lassies. (they are not all MEN MEN MEN)

448    One by one the women climbed up on deck, a total of 8. These gals
449 were all wearing black clothing and  crosses (gasp!!! nuns!!!).

451      Salty ordered the retreat!!! Ieeeee Let's get out of here!! His
452 men were off the english ship faster than you can say pokeacabinboy.
453 (they did manage to hire on one young spud.) And they were on their
454 way, sighing in relief.  too close for comfort that one. "Full sail"
455 could be heard as the Jolly Rodger fled like a dog with it's tail
456 between it's legs.   And such good men they were. ( not the end...)

481 DUNE     I was VERY disappointed. My critizism is aimed at the
482 director. His poor choice of actors (Paul from Yakima) and his
483 inability to develop characters has made this a CLASS C movie.
484 Good acting and dialouge was replaced with dry and lifeless
485 thoughts (telling the audiance the story). A good movie brings 
486 characters alive, special effects enhance the scene, proper 
487 editing gives continuity. DUNE is a good sci-fi novel because 
488 the characters are WELL developed and several novel ideas are 
489 introduced  ie... the scaricity of water. The movie isn't good 
490 because of bad acting, bad casting, bad script, mediocre special effects, and poor directing. Movie 
491 goers expect (and deserve) better quality.

497   Color surrounded the piper as he floated -- gold shining around him in an
498 infinite sphere, black streaking and spiraling through the gold, red shimmering
499 in a flat spiral from a nucleus of white, orange, and more black.  Slowly these
500 shapes took on solidity until, with an almost audible snap, he recognized them.
501   Fighting for her life, surrounded by a haze of blood, the pegasus had been
502 wounded twice on one side.  The tiger-like winged carnivore had not gone 
503 unscathed.  The hooves and wings of the pegasus had taken their toll, and 
504 catlike in the extreme, had increased the determination of the carnivore.
505   The pegasus' wingspan was a liability here.  The carnivore, with a much shorter wingspan was 
506 more manuverable.  Only extreme care, and lashing hooves had kept the pegasus
507 in the fight this long.  The piper waited helplessly, unable to move, still
508 holding the dead tree that he had plucked out of the ground as he fell.

577   Milo started to walk away towards the nearest town.  The town where
578 he must show that he is able to take care of himself, he had something
579 comming to him and he wasn't going to let anyone take that away ,
580 no matter how old he was.  He had to show them for one last time and then
581 that would be the end of it.  Milo walked along, eating a little and 
582 admiring his new weapons.
583  
584   Behind Milo, back on the edge of the forest there stood a tremendous
585 winged being.  Riding it was a pitch black figure, a shadow against the
586 white snow on the branches of the trees.  The being waited, never moving,
587 not even a twitch, just waited there watching milo as he walked along.
588 The men, after picking themselves up and collecting the dogs, saw the huge
589 being sitting there.  They found thier rope and walked up behind it.  They
590 were going to get this creature, it must have helped that little guy escape.
591 They let out a battle cry and rushed up behind the dark rider.  They were
592 running up when the fire hit, both men were ablaze.  They rolled in the snow
593 and tried to put out the flames but within seconds they were burnt to the 
594 bone.
595  
596   The figure returned it's gaze to milo, who was almost out of sight.  It 
597 gave the being a small command, the great wings opened wide with such
598 strength the branches on the trees were swaying back and forth loosing the
599 snow that had weighted them down.  The huge being rose off the ground and
600 into the air and was suddenly gone along with the flurry of the wind.  The
601 snow was then back on the branches just like before and the tracks were
602 just as easily erased.

605   The story goes on, oh well.  what kind of trouble will Milo get himself
606 into next?  I'll have to think of something.  
607   It's snowing!  I love it.  I wish I could go outside and stay there and
608 just watch the snow fall.  Too bad I would freeze by bippy off!  Burrrrr.
609 Well, I'll go now.
