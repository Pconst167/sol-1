 49 Kathy:  Don't feel bad. We all have our computer hassles once in a
 50 while.  (:  The eggplant recipe sounds very interesting and spicy.

 52 I prefer sweets, myself. I'll try to find something yummy and 
 53 different to post. Meanwhile... Bacon and Peanut Butter Sandwich!

 56 Now that we have shared the obligatory food offerings with each other, I'd
 57 sort of like to get to know the other people who read ladies room. How do 
 58 you happen to have found your ways to the modem world and with writers as
 59 crazy people to know?
 60   
 61 I am an artist (ceramics and sculpture) and I write sheerly for my own
 62 enjoyment (children's stories, erotica and assorted miscellanea). I ended
 63 up in modem world about 4 or 5 years ago when my "wretch" of a brother saw 
 64 a modem for sale in the paper and I foolishly went out and addicted myself.
 65 My family subverted my sanity and life forever by talking me into a 
 66 computer in the first place and then into a modem.
 67   
 68 I'd love to know a little about the others here.

 71 Jessie: Well, since we're being nosey, er, inquisitive...
 72 My Macintosh SE was a high school graduation present from dear
 73 old dad. The only writing I have done is the occassional school
 74 paper and word processing.  I haven't written for my own pleasure
 75 in many years. As for modems, I owe my modem literacy to somebody
 76 short, furry, and obnoxious. Yup, you guessed it. An X-boyfriend.
 77 He arranged an actual e-mail account at one of the state univer-
 78 sities for me, and showed me how to dial-up and login. The 
 79 terminal program I'm currently using was given to me by a sub-
 80 sequent "significant other", who is no longer very significant at 
 81 all.  (:  It's almost funny. I'm not a techie; I'm a tech groupie.
 82 Ah well. I happened across a list of Portland BBS's from 1989 and
 83 decided to give a few of them a try. This was the first one I 
 84 connected to, and it is my favorite so far. Every so often I get
 85 adventurous and try a new BBS, but I like Mikey and his Cistern.

 88 Peace, I do tend to be a bit inquisitive (actually nosy is not my style as
 89 my nose hasn't worked in years due to allergies). I'm a people junkie an
 90 d I tend to like to dig out understandings of how and why they tick. And to
 91 a people junkie, nothing is worse than no conversation unless of course it 
 92 is converstation that is lifeless and boring, hence I tend to hob nob with
 93 writers and artists and tech people myself. I like a good mind almost bter
 94 than I like desserts. But please bear in mind that I also like people as 
 95 they are and if something makes them uncomfortable, it will do the same
 96 with me, so share only what makes you happy to share.
 97   
 98 I just happen to dabble in people I guess because I'm kind of philosophic

100 Greetings, who peeks here?  This is Denise, an old-timer.  Does
101 anyone know if Pam is truly in Seattle?
102 Why did Mike make a "ladies room"?  Is it an old-fashioned courtesy,
103 or something requested?
104 Is it actually private?  If you see this message sometime in the
105 decade, don't be shy:  say something!  Perhaps Mike was thinking
106 about the custom of females tripping off to the restroom together,
107 and hoped to attract a feminine touch to a lonely man's hangout?
