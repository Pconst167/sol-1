119 From the land of teeny-bopper BB systems. Dark Nite, are you a kid-sysop? Oh,
120 another 16-year-old who throws you in to chat every time you log on, just
121 'cause he wants to talk. Then when his parents figure out what that strange
122 beep is when they pick up the phone before junior is home, POP goes a system.
123 Is there any mention of the taking down of this system in the trades? No. Is
124 there any public notice at all? No. It is gone, forever, into that tidal
125 pool where all good Commode boards go after a couple months. The sysops
126 sometime accuse the F.B.I., but I suspect it's more a case of M.O.M. and
127 D.A.D. Tsk Tsk, and they had such promise too.
128 
129 Of the multitude of computer systems in town, Commodore boards lead the
130 stats in 'Strange Hours', 'Call ahead before using modem', 'Gone without
131 a trace', '300 baud only', 'Multiple kid-co-sysops', and 'User fees.' Now
132 this last one is really funny. Anyone got $10 to spend downloading pirated
133 C64 games at 300 buad. Ya, sounds like a good way to spend an evening.

145 Could it be...?
146 NO, I am not a "kid-sysop"...Whoever you are, you really sound like a total
147 ____face.  Yes, I'm resorting to personal insults, but I can come up with
148 some good arguments against you too.
149 First of all, you need to get your facts straight.
150 1)  My BBS was run on an Atari
151 2)  There were no d/l's.  It was for mature users who wrote stories, etc.
152 3)  It went down because of software and hardware problems, not
153     my parents.  I have my own line and they keep out of my computer
154     business (I have them well trained!)

155 SO, before you start ragging on BBS's, get your facts straight.  Besides,
156 I think the only reason you've decided to make fun of "teeny-bopper" BBS's
157 is because you don't have a Commode and are jealous of all the programs
158 and popularity they have.  You probably have a TI or some other thing with
159 no software and don't like commodes or tennagers because they have more soft-
160 ware and you're an old fart who gets no enjoyment out of life anymore except
161 by picking on people younger than you.
162 And by the way, have you considered signing your messages so that I know
163 who I'm "debating" with?  Or is it that you're afraid I might "blow up your
164 house" or some other such thing that paranoid "ADULTS" think of...

198 your case has. If I am an old fart, then you are a young one, because you
199 display the same anti-social tendancies lunatics show just before they
200 are taken away. Your snide remarks and pseudo-moral convictions about
201 running crummy computer boards on crummy computers by immature teens like
202 yourself make me laugh. Ho ho ho. As for my name, you need not know my
203 name. I am not afriad of you blowing up my house. I am afraid of you
204 wetting on my front lawn. Besides, you should know who I am. I was a user
205 on your system. I've talked to you on the phone. I was actually nice to
206 you. It was all an act to expose your true, childish side. When I use
207 the term commodore, you are welcome to put in its place any of the cheap
208 Toys-r-Us computers, such as your own Atari. Now I'm sure you will be 
209 calling right back and just huffing and puffing to say something clever.
210 But we already know the truth. Think about it darky, don't you remember

216 who is on here just to cause trouble.  If you don't like teeny-bopper BBS's
217 (if such things exist) then don't call them!  Is it so hard to prevent yourself
218 from dialing the number????  Rather than put a system down, just don't call!!!
219 Not calling can hurt a BBS as much as publicly putting it down.  But in your

250 Dark Knight:   Whoever the other guy was talking about cheapo bbs systems, I
251 believe he had a good point.  Generally, bbs's that run on Commodores, and
252 to some extent Atari;
253 systems tend to be quite unreliable, and almost always low in performance. If
254 you regularly read the backwater bbs list (in the past) you saw the fact that
255 nearly all changes were due to various cheap systems going up, coming down,
256 like yo-yos.  This may not reflect on your system, which I have never called.
257 Cheapo systems seem to use poor programming, like the absence of control-
258 character abort and output pause. (CTRL S,Q, and C).  Reliable systems like
259 this, the CBBS's, Bit Bucket, Nerdolux, and Fidos seem to ALL support such
260 vital features.  Why is this?  Commodore systems are exceedingly slow, 
261 introducing quite visible delays in many operations. (some up to 30 seconds,
262 maybe more!)  How come?  Cheapo systems often only run 300 baud, even though
263 NEW 1200 baud modems cost less than $180, and used ones must be less. When you
264 consider that phone charges are around $20 per month, if it's worth making a
265 bbs, it's worth running it at 1200.
266   This is the second time I've heard the good old, "if you don't like my 
267 computer, you must be jealous c
268 ause you can't get one."  This statement stupidly assumes that the guy
269 doesn't have a better computer than a Commodore or Atari. (quite unlikely).
270 Besides, if I had no computer at all, I certainly wouldn't want one of 
271 those.  (a Commodore bbs twit sysop once told me that I didn't like Commodore's
272 because my parents wouldn't buy me one.  He obviously didn't know me.  I 
273 pointed out to him that, pushing 30 years old and owning more than a dozen
274 computers, it was highly unlikely that my parents would ever buy me a computer.
275 Besides, I added, I had already DESIGNED more computers that he
276 d ever owned.)
277   So don't assume that someone is just jealous of your computer because he
278 doesn't seem to like it.    And most Commodore and Atari systems DO seem to need
279 major software re-writes.  Yours may not, but that's not the point. I, for one,
280 would love to see juvenile programmers suddenly learn to program well, but until
281 they do, you'll see comments disparaging "cheapo systems."  To be fair, I would
282 criticize all systems that seem to run as slowly and poorly as cheapos, regardless
283 of what computer they run on.  Give me an example of a slow, poor programmed
284 non-Apple, non-Commodore, non-Atari system, and I'll call it and see..
285 ================================================= P. V. Jeltz ===============
286 I can't give you an example of a non-slow "cheapo" computer BBS, because there are none.  Those of us who don't happen to
287 have a lot of money have to settle for what we can get.  I happened to get an Atari.  I am NOT defending it as the best
288 computer available...far from it.  I just don't have the $$$ for a better one at the moment  (due to the fact that I'm
289 16 and don't want to be tied down to the responsibility of a job yet.  That will soon change though, because, as I get o
290 older, I inevitably get more responsible and need a job more and more).  I realize there are far better computer systems
291 out there and I'm not saying Atari is even the best for the money.
292 To the unsigned user:  I don't think your message deserves any comment from me.  The more you rant and rave the more
293 you show other users (including me) just how childish you really are.  As to the
294 fact that you logged on my BBS once, all I can say is that I guess that I need to step up the "twit-filter"....
295                    -DK-
296 Dark Knight: I knew the sysop of a C-64 bbs. He wrote it himself & was
297 always working to improve it. I also know another person with who had a
298 board on a C-64 using software that he got from some BBS. It was still
299 full of bugs when it went down.
300 Unfortunately, the second person is typical of most "cheap" computer BBS
301 systems. For what it's worth the first guy was a teenager, & the second
302 was in his mid 30's. Age is not always an indicator.
303 But most BBS's being run with of-the-shelf software by a sysop who doesn't
304 know how to modify it for optimum performance in his application aren't
305 worth the time it takes to call them. 
306 This is not to say that "homebrew" BBS's are perfect either. But most of
307 the boards with the shortest times on line (from when they started til
308 they went down for good) were C-64 boards with public domain software.
309 AE lines don't have a very good record either. 
310 Commodore boards suffer one further problem. The Westridge modem is the
311 *worst* modem on the market for a BBS. The tone-switching means that it
312 is not possible to call them reliably with many modems. (BELL 103 requires
313 a *steady* tone for a second or so). I've been told that it has some 
314 peculiarities from a programmer's point of view also. Yet it remains one
315 of the most common (if not THE most common) modem on C-64 boards.
316 Atari & Commodore both share the problem of NON-ASCII character sets. 
317 Atari is the worst offender in this regard (just barely) becuase of it's
318 use of printable ASCII characters as control codes (CHR$(125) & CHR$(126)).
319 I've never been on your board. I probably never will (with 80 boards in my
320 free calling area there just isn't enough time to check them all out). 
321 So this may or may not be appropiate advice. Due to the behavior of most
322 of the C64 & Atari boards, you'll have to work a bit harder to be accepted
323 and also try not to take all of these comments personally. Stick it out
324 & act in a mature manner & then the only ones making the cracks will be the
325 jerks that have to insult everyone.

352 Well, as you can see, Mr. Unsigned, most of the people on BWMS are on my side (with good reason!).  I don't see the
353 that this argument deserves any more discussion (especially since I am leaving this Thursday July 24th to go live in
354 Seattle).  So, if you would kindly blow it out your hemorrhoidal wazoo, we'll
355 all be happy....

359 To the Dark Knight and "Mr. Mysterious" and anybody at all who happens to 
360 be paying attention to all this rot... DON'T!!! That just means that
361 I'm really getting pretty fed up with all of this constant fussing over
362 matters of little or no importance to a large majority (I'm sure) of the
363 users of the Backwash. It started out nicely enough, and might have turned
364 into a legitimate debate, but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! DK and ??? had to
365 start hurling mud at each other, which is really only a waste of Mikey's
366 (the Backwater Phantom's???) disk space, and also a waste of mud (which
367 could better be put to use by hurling it at Republicans. If you run out
368 of your own mud, read a copy of Meese's report.) I just had to put in my
369 twopence, now I'm off to see "Howard the Duck"... reviews to come!

371 SORRRRRYYYYY for being serious.....     SHOGUN SARDUCI

374    dear Dark Knight,
375                     I hope that in your future time streams, (and Seattle..)you
376 can avoid further brushes with twits going through male menopause or menopause
377 or both.. like our dear unknown assailant the Mr.Mysterious of BWMS, and please
378 spare an occasional long-distance to BWMS to further enlighten and entertain we
379 bored interplanetary/temporal travellors as we try to repair the Omega, Zeta,
380 and Chameleon circuits... for our last brush with the CyberCommander did much
381 damage to the old girl... and as we aqll know, type 40's aren't as tough as
382 they used to be, a few millenia ago..... Gotta run, the Doctor's spotted
383 Davros somewhere/when ahead.......
384                            Bye for now/then/might be,

398 She walked into the room, her hair flowing about her shoulders in a
399 rather haphazard way. She had the air about her of one who is trying
400 to figure out exactly what to do next, but she knew waht to do.
401 Even if the room had been crowded (which it was far from, there being
402 only one occupant in the voluminous control center) she could have
403 easily picked out who she was here to see. Brian was seated across the
404 room in a high-backed chair, huched over a glowing terminal, muttering
405 unitelligably to himself about power-to-weight ratios, liftoff factors,
406 electron manifold configurations and plasma nephresis anti-polar drive
407 inducers. She walked over to him, more unsure of herself than ever, and
408 asked him what he thought he was doing. 
409 
410 "What?" he said, and then he turned around to note that she was 
411 
412 Huh?
413 What happened to the story?

425 Greetings,
426 	It's been awhile..  The forth of July weekend was really wonderful,
427 My husband Bob and I joined 6 other friends for a weekend of hiking,camping
428 and fishing at Muskratt lake.  It's about 50 miles SE of Bend in the Three
429 Sisters Wilderness.
430 	One of the neat things about Muskratt is the cabin, cabins are very
431 unusual in the wilderness area, expecially public domian cabins.  It's a
432 first come first serve basis, with all the comforts of home except running
433 water and electricy.   Actually there is a stream outside the front door
434 and lake lake out the back door and a outhouse up on the hill.  What more
435 do you want?  
436 	We had a great time and swore we would be back soon,  we did, we
437 went back last wednesday to fish for our gournet dinner party and we 
438 found the most obnoxious group of horsecampers we had ever met.  About
439 8 people with 12 (count em) 12 hourse. and 5 mangy LOUD dogs.  these 
440 folks were grazing their horses right on the lake and just tearing up[
441 the beautiful meadows.  the law states to keep horses a minumum of 200
442 feet from water for grazing purposes, these guys did not belong in the
443 wilderness, they had no respect for keeping things as nice as when you
444 arrived.  (leave nothing but footprints ect...)  the Cabin was a mess
445 garbage all over the place.   
446 	We just tryed to ignore them and blew up our raft and started
447 fishin', with a couple of hours we had caught enough for our party and
448 we were ready to go.  We packed everything up and started to head out
449 looking back at the cabin and the people that shouldn't have been there.
450 	So now I have a pet peeve,  against  HORSE-CAMPERS  just a
451 few bad apples ruined the whole bunch.

469 Before we start talking about Commodore and Atari boards, maybe we had better consider some of the other cheap boards that
470 fly around town.  What about these Apple boards?  These folks are trying to run a
471 BBs with a computer that is 15 years behind even the VIC-20.  No wonder they are so
472 flakey.  And what is this glamor about running a "non-commercial computer" BBS?
473 All the bit buckets, and BWMSs and all the other garbage that people make such a big
474 deal out of --who cares?  Are we to be impressed that you can take a processor and some ram and make a BBs out of it.
475 Who cares?  Everybody says lets quit this argument and get Backwash back on track. What for?  So we can read more stories 
476 about dungeons and dragons? I would rather watch bubbles rise.  Everybody says lets stop, but has to get their point of view
477 in before they sign out -- practice <-> preach.
478 You wanted an exapmle of a slow board, take a look at backwater.  It can't even handle a good typist.  People are slapping 
479 around Atari boards...need I mention PAC?  One of the most well established, and versatile boards in the state.  The comment
480 about this board being public access being a "privilege" and not a "right" is TORO
481 POO-POO.  If the number is public, the board is public.  It is as simple as that.  You publish it, we call it.  So I am not 
482 covering anything up, I am here to argue.  I don't make fleeting statements about
483 being able to design more computers than you have sneezed on, or call myself kiddie
484 dungeons and dragons names and then cry about people not leaving real names.  I bid you fair-well, and say....EAT!!

496      It seems there is an abundance of Dr. Who fans on here.  What better
497 place could there be to launch an attack on the Doctor himself?
498      No, I don't mean the patron of this system who is presumptuous enough
499 to call himself the 'Doctor.'  Nor do I refer to the actual Dr. Who himself
500 - whoever that may be (anyone who has seen glimpses of more than one Dr.
501 Who episode knows that the character has been portrayed by numerous actors.
502 This sci-fi hero apparently has the ability to change his physical
503 appearance each show with only the audience noticing that he was a
504 different person last week).  I mean, of course, the show Doctor Who.
505      Yes, Doctor Who, that creative series with superb special effects,
506 oscar-award winning acting, and above all... intricate plots that leave the
507 most intelligent among us completely baffled (twits: This is called
508 sarcasm).  In honesty though, the plots are seemingly complex.  I say
509 'seemingly' because they aren't really complex, the show just makes them
510 SEEM that way by using dialog which contains words unlisted in any
511 dictionary on this Earth.  Dr. Who fans know what I'm talking about - words
512 like Tardis and the various fascinating names the show's creators dream up
513 for all the different monsters which get regular guest appearances.  I
514 wouldn't mind this so much, but when a show has to rely on bizarre-sounding
515 names to give off an other-worldly ambience, it's time it be trashed.
516      And we all know that the show has nothing else to contribute to the
517 other-worldly setting besides the names.  The show's sets are purely
518 English (fake).  Most of us are aware that the English chiefly produce soap
519 operas, or should I say 'serials' to be polite?  Now you ask me, what
520 studios and lighting do the English use for Dr. Who?  Why, soap opera
521 studios, of course.  You know, the dim lighting, crummy recording quality
522 and general cheap atmosphere.  Need I mention the unconvincing appearance
523 of the above-mentioned monsters?  This in itself has to be seen to be
524 believed.
525      Perhaps I am looking too shallowly.  Should I look deeper into the
526 show?  Well, I already told you my opinion of the plot.  Some fans tell me
527 they watch it for the many interesting concepts developed by the writers. 
528 I'll grant you that writers have imagination, but even fantasy must have
529 one foot planted in reality in order for mere physical human beings to
530 understand.  I'm not saying this show has no aspects of reality.  A
531 time-space travelling phone booth sounds highly practical to me.  Maybe we
532 should get our top scientists working on one.
533      I was told by several Enlish citizens (both teen-age and adult) that
534 only children watch it in England (up to 5th grade).  I know many college
535 students here in the U.S. who are wrapped up in this show and would suffer
536 withdrawal if a Saturday went by without it.  Perhaps this makes an
537 unpleasant commentary on our national literacy level and audience
538 sophistication.  Perhaps my sampling of Enlish and Americans is too small.
539      In either case, I still maintain that this Enlish import leaves much
540 to be desired.  This show stretches the imagination in only one way -
541 getting it's audience to believe that it really isn't THAT boring.  Quite
542 frankly, I'm not fooled.

545 This message has been brought to you by:

547 
548 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
549 Dip: Please note that *no* BBS running at 300 baud can handle a good typist.
550 Also note that BWMS has *never* claimed to be a sophisticated 'state of the
551 art' (etc) BBS. It is doing quite well for a system running on 10 year old
552 hardware (and it only has 8k of ROM & 1k of RAM). Due to it's age changes in
553 the firmware are not possible. 
554 I might also add that Apples are not "15 years older than the VIC-20". As a matter
555 of fact, the 6502 processor isn't even 15 years old!
556 Beatrice: I don't claim that Doctor Who is the greatest show in the world. I'm
557 not a rabid "Whovian". But I do feel that you are overlooking some points.
558 1. The show is a *daily*. One 30 minute 'episode' a day, 5 days a week.
559 2. It is *low budget*. Here in the US we have commercials that use more than
560    the annual budget of Doctor Who.
561 3. Contrary to your perceptions, the Doctor's appearance does not vary from
562    episode to episode. In the show's 20 year history, they have changed
563    Doctors only 6 times. And in each case they devoted a number of episodes
564    to the change. 
565 4. The episodes are rarely shown in anything approaching the correct order here.
566 This makes things more confusing than necessary.
