54 A cold fog drifts in to cover the Inn. A clamor of meaningless voices is 
55 heard by some, but it only drifts in the background for the Innkeeper. The 
56 Inn itself shifts and shimmers as if in a haze, loosing its reality, as if 
57 some force that had been keeping it together was loosing control not being 
58 able to concentrate its full force of power to maintain the Inn. As the 
59 shimmering gets worse, it momentarily disappears completely to be replaced 
60 by a battered and broken piece of equipment that had obviously been 
61 discarded long ago as a worthless relic. An intermittent clicking and 
62 whiring sound can be heard to come from it. Yet even this the Innkeeper does 
63 not seem to take notice of. He sits out in front of the Inn, looking out 
64 towards the footbridge watching, waiting. 
65 Absently he swats at the gnats who seek the cool moisture of his skin. The 
66 warm afternoon sun shines down, lolling him to sleep. Jerking upright he 
67 settles back again. Spying a speck on the horizon he peers intently at it 
68 untill he is certain it is not that for which he waits. Soon the sun does 
69 its work again and this time he falls asleep. An untouched glass of ale is 
70 by his side long since turned warm and lost of its potentcy in the sun. Even 
71 as he sleeps, the Innkeeper stirs fitfully, even in his sleep he waits.

76 Well, I am back, though from the looks of things it may not be to stay.
77 I know I left my character in the lurch but I was hit by finals and the
78 other crunches that hit at the end of the school year, maybe I should
79 get the traveller out of his predicament. (Does anyone remember that, about
80 four weeks ago?) What happened to the adventure that was taking place, did it
81 just fizzle out like the previous one? Milchar, Bard, L'homme, these are the 
82 only names in the last two disks that I recognize, where did all of the others
83 come from? I might be back and try to get somthing going...

109 Traveller:  Glad to have you back!!!!!  If you don't recognize the new
110 identity, this is the Doctor's son (bet you didn't know that he had one, did
111 you???).  I am the same person that played The Doctor, but Doctor had a pressing
112 engagement.  He had to take over as the new Lord-President of Galifrey.

129 ----------
130 Well, folks, I hope I am not considered a "juvie" (being 30) and I am trying
131 to be a good citizen. I was not totally aware of the proper etiquette with
132 respect to inviting myself into the running group fiction, so I apologize
133 to L'Homme for over-using his character (it had to be SOMEONE, and he was
134 the only one I could remember by name).
135    Seems to me that part of the problem with the story bogging down (I infer
136 from what I have read that it does so often) would be precisely that there
137 cannot be very much interaction between the characters - due to practical
138 limits. Perhaps in addition to the character-per-author, there should be
139 a few which belong to the group as a whole and can be manipulated by
140 anyone. I hereby offer the *Scarlet* character to the world - SOMEONE get
141 him out of the stone, please! I have some plot hooks in mind for that, but
142 am not really sure how to get involved. See, right now *Scarlet* is stuck
143 in the Rothman Ruby with the desicated corpse of Scurrilous the thief,
144 and the ruby is in the back seat of Bard's (?) car - and everyone is
145 inside drinking and whooping it up...
146    To the guy who is looking for other BBS numbers: Call CBBS at 646-xxxx
147 and enter the command "H,DIR-LOCAL". It will list all the local ones.
148 If you want a different source, try the Bit Bucket (761-xxxx) and
149 try the "I" command.
150 You have now been given a complete answer - quit asking.
151    To Net #1 - I am not sure if Karnaugh is part ofyour crew, but I enjoyed
152 his ciphered gun-fight scene - it was worthy to be part of the running
153 story. As to your double-cipher, is it against the rules for non-members
154 to try breaking it (as an intellectual excercise, of course)? I already
155 proved to myself that one of them was coded with a 7-letter key, but
156 didn't go beyond that to try to work it out.
157    Lastly (and perhaps too longly) the general run of the interactive
158 fiction reminds me greatly of the book "Options" by Robert Sheckley. I
159 strongly recommend it to the audience collectively.
160    If I step out of line, please tell me. I wish to be a good citizen.

176 L'homme: This is how to get a bell-like tone on a C-64:

182 "Where have you all been?  The Doctor and I arrived just a little while ago.  He left- pressing business, you 
183 understand.  And who is this person?"  Voyeur and the Bard began to take turns explaining all of the events to date,
184 and finally Milchar nodded.  "It's been the same for me... the Realities seem to be moving by themselves, leaving 
185 creatures and objects behi..."  Just then, the Inn shuddered, as if wrenched from it's very foundations and hurled
186 through vast space.  A quick glance outside of the Inn showed all-  the Inn had moved!  "My car...", sobbend L'homme.
187 "My equipment!", yelled Bard, knocking over Voyeur's drink.  "My drink!", cried Voyeur.  
188 "Hold on, let's get organized.  First, get all the things that we shall need for another expedition, tools, wine, etc.
189 Next, I shall try to bring L'homme's car to us, as it seems to be lighter than the Inn is.  Your equipment is still 
190 in the car, is it not?"  Bard nodded.  "Well, then.  Stand back."  Milchar places on hand on the Amulet, and 
191 gesturing wildly with the other, intones, "EHONV DEGTK FIKAE MR!"

254 juvies that is not fit for general consumption. You have not been considered
255 a juvie. I have thought of you as questionable. I figure that with the right

331 The Corporate Move Committee agreed unanimously on how to approach J.B., 
332 head of Amalgamated Enterprises Ltd., by memo. Problems had cropped up after
333 the company's crosstown move to sparkling new quarters, and J.B. ordered the
334 CMC to make a fast trouble report. Its final memo went like this:
335 - Your committee has, indeed, found a number of areas requiring amelioration
336 but we are certain that all faults will be rectified. Although it might take
337 some time.
338 - Item: The furniture supplier takes full responsibility for supplying the 
339 wrong desks and seats to the executive floor. Owing to a computer ordering 
340 error we have the desks and seats designayed for Bayview Junior 
341 Kindergarten. The supplier says that if your executives can just scrunch 
342 through to the end of the week the switch can be made on the weekend. The 
343 supplier asked us to add, J.B., that your own executive, all-level, fully 
344 reversible swivel chair will take a little longer - it will have to be 
345 steam-cleaned for bubble gum removal.
346 - Item: The climate control consultants have tracked down the reason for the
347 twenty-four-hour outflow of arctic air. They warn that repairs will take 
348 several days and suggest a general issue of gloves and mufflers.
349 - Item: The plumbing consultants have asked us to apologize profusely to you
350 and your secretary for their error in supplying two-way glass for your 
351 executive washroom instead of the one-way mirror you had requested. They 
352 realize that this exposed you to considerable embarrassment until the error 
353 became apparent.
354 - Item: Payroll has asked us to extend apologies for the mixup in salary 
355 checks caused by the move. They will issue you a new one for your full 
356 amount as soon as they can find the stockroom clerk who apparently received 
357 your check while you received his. Unfortunately, he seems to have been 
358 taken ill on the afternoon of payday and has not been seen since.
359 - Item: Meanwhile, the cash office will be glad to issue you an advance as 
360 soon as the comptroller countersigns your request. There may be a some 
361 slight delay in this as he went to level D in search of a BLT sandwich 
362 yesterday and has not reported back. It is believed that he may have missed 
363 a turn.
364 - Item: The building supervisor reports that the automatic revolving doors 
365 are still jammed on 'fast ahead' and are hurling visitors either into the 
366 lobby or across the street. He recommends immediate construuction of 
367 emergency doors and suggests we start at the glass wall through which a 
368 moving truck backed last week.
369 - Item: The vice president of finance asks us to tell you that he does not 
370 mind having his desk in the freight elevator for the next week. But in the 
371 meantime he would like s longer phone cord. He would also like an elevator 
372 floor-locking device so he can be sure his office will still be there when 
373 he returns from the washroom.
374 - Item: The management of the parking garage asked us to issue a general 
375 apology to all users for failing to post a sign warning of freshly poured 
376 concrete. Specifically, they asked us to tell you that your car will be 
377 chipped out in the next day or two.
378 - Item: Building security conducted an extensive check on rumors that some 
379 staff had been trapped in the no-exit stairwells. The security search party 
380 reports the stairwells deserted and now requests, by walkie-talkie, that we 
381 let them back into the main part of the building by drilling the lock on 
382 level C.
383 - Item: Your Corporate Move Committee suggests that, starting now, 
384 membership on said committee be on a rotating basis as service obviously 
385 will be onerous and lengthy.

411 Hello All:I was just wondering,I do that a lot,how it is that
412 Helen Keller thought.it may be a strange question,but I am a strange person.She 
413 never learned a language and as such,what did she think in?
414 we think in english,i.e. #I need a beer# and some of us other languages,i.e.
415 #j'y suis,j'y reste#
416 now,what language did Helen Keller think in?
417 The Man in Gray

419 P.s. to "unbeliever" I do not use a gun,I use intellegence(duh,duh) and when
420 that fails,I use an explosive called PETN,very effective.
421 By the way,my files show y
422 that the second letter of your last name is an "I" am I correct?

426 MiG: Up to your usual tricks, I see.  Second letter "I"; let's see...
427 Interesting question (Helen Keller). Is that what those 'shrooms do to you?
428 Corporate Move Committee: I must agree with CISTOP MIKEY.  That was the most
429 imaginative entry since the Ivancie Logon.  In the best of times, it would
430 be notable.  In the present circumstances, 'tis like an oasis to a man
431 dying of thirst.  Hope to hear from you again.
432 MIKEY: I approve of the 'enter only'.  This is the first time I have
433 ever seen a disk get SHORTER each time I log on.
434 Is it my imagination, or is the first entry on this disk what used to
435 be at least line 100?  Tsk, tsk.

450 The ship 'Heart of Gold' was streaking through space at its normal high
451 speed.  Zaphod Beeblbrox, Arthur Dent, Trillian, and Ford Prefect were all
452 inside the ship.  "Let's land and see where we are Zaphod." Ford suggested.
453 #Sounds like a good idea.  Hang on to yourself for a minute..."  Zaphod
454 walked over to the controls and started playing around with Infinite
455 Improbability Drive.  #We've landed, people!!!# Zaphod said after a few 
456 moments.  Everybody except Ford went outside.  Ford was busy examining the
457 computer.  While fiddling around with the computer, Ford accidentally
458 engaged the Drive.  When he arrived at his destination, though he didn't know

469 Subject: Color Computer Terminal Program info
470 We would be EXTREMELY interested in the information you offered on 
471 CBBS/NW. You contact us through the current PAUG secretary or through
472 one of the Sysops on Nerdolux.
473 As for the cipher, if you can read it - feel free. Note: only LOW
474 security msgs will be going out in the old cipher. The new cipher is different 
475 (and hopefully somewhat more secure!)
476 01010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
477 To: ALL Net operatives and agents
478 Cipher text should be kept to a minimum! Every msg gives the opposition
479 that much more data to crack the code. Long msgs increase the risk. We suggest a
480 study of CW abbreviations and the like. These are TELEGRAMS, not phone calls!
481 On a related subject, agents are being to free with secret & classified
482 data (such as IDs of net operatives!) Please be more circumspect.
483 Finally, before entering an enciphered msg, set the margin to 125
484 (ie exit enter mode, type MA 125, & return to enter mode). This will provide 21 
485 groups per line without interfering with the FI & FA commands. Do NOT use MA 125
486 for non-cipher material!

488 ps. the Net does not take any credit for the corporate troubles
489 described above. However, all units should take special note of the techniques 
490 and methods mentioned. They are the sort of thing we expect to happen to
491 "obstacles". Mckane Enterprises, for example.

501 The Inn seemed to lurch for an instant, but was probably just the drinks.
502 After all, since the Resolution, adventures didn't happen AT the Inn!

504 Milchar: As noted, THE INN IS SACROSANCT!!! Also, I do NOT spill drinks! I am a

525 Scarlet huddled on the ground in the strange crimson place.
526    "Where in hell AM I?" he muttered. "Well, I might as well look around..."
527    Searching the body of the man near-by (seemingly dead for years or
528 perhaps centuries) Scarlet found lock picks, a few coins, and a key.
529    "All I have to do now is find something that this key fits and maybe
530 I can get out of here." (Just goes to show you how desperate he got -
531 the key didn't do Scurrilous any good!)
532    "Odd, when in this form, I can become gaseous and flow anywhere I
533 want. How come I can't leave the stone by myself?
534    "If I ever get out of this, I should be an even better burglar than I
535 ever was before. I had to snatch purses and steal packages out of cars -
536 now I can slip into anywhere that has a ventilator! I could be rich!
537    "All I have to do is get out of here..." and with that he lost control
538 and sobbed from loneliness and frustration.
539    The Rothman ruby continued to glow, getting brighter as he cried.

542 this is Teddy salad speaking. as referance to your question of how unoriginal
543 "teddy salad" is Ninja, How about yours? on some cracked games my friend Bill
544 has I saw The name Ninja as a person who cracked one of the games. And it 
545 probably wasnt you because the only people who can break games are "juvies"
546 Who ever heard of a Old Apple user? As were I got my name, well I got it 
547 from late night Monty Python!!! I presume that is past your bedtime.
