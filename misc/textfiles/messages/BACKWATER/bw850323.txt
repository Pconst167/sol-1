21 It is customary, I believe, to say something when one finds oneself
22 at the TOP!  I can say only that the Innkeeper and Patrons of this
23 Inn are to be congratulated for what they have offered to one who enters
24 from what is essentially a different world....
25    Also I should say that for the first time in many weeks I am having
26 a line noise problem and have been cut off twice!  I am not sure just
27 what this entry is going to look like.

41 @(  "Milchar!", Dimat exclaimed.  "I had begun to worry.  You had taken so long
42 to respond, I wasn't sure what to think.  A terrible conflict is raging."
43   Milchar, still stunned to see that his homeland, at least this part of it,
44   was no longer the beautiful park-like place he had known, paused a long time
45  before he answered.
46   "Dimat," Milchar began slowly, "Who has done such a thing?
47   How were we defended?  What force could have torn Celene at it's very
48   roots?"
49 "Do you remember the Spellbinders of Trill?"
50  Thinking a moment, Milchar remembered  the odd group of illusionists that
51 entralled audiences with there clever cantrips and deceptions.  "Yes, master."
52   "And do you remember what they wrought here in Celene, when you last
53   came here?"
54   "They had put on a grand show for the townspeople.  I still remember the
55  clarity of their work."
56  "Good, your memory is as sharp as ever.  The Spellbinders have done
57  something that no one ever supposed they would succeed at.  They've crossed
58   that boundary between illusion and reality.  Some of their figures are
59   now of true flesh and blood.  And now, my questing pupil, they wish to
60   possess all that they can of Celene."
61  "Do you mean that some of this waste about us is false?  Illusion?  How
62 much is not?"
63   "Only a True Seeing can tell for sure.  I called you to aid me to
64 cleanse our land of their danger."
65  A sudden blast rocked the ground.  "Cover!", Dimat yelled as he dived
66   behind a nearby boulder.
67   Outlines of gruesome creatures lined the mist about Dimat and Milchar,
68   augumenting their imaginations of the shapes of the beasts.
69 Milchar wished desparately for more of his equipment in his tower.
70  After a few moments, Milchar decided that the stars were not in the right
71 alignment for wishing, and gave it up.
72 (Well, at least this time the lines are complete.  I wonder what causes 
73 those two characters at the beginning of the file?)

86 now it seems pregant with innumerable possibilities, later -- around half way--
87 it seems more mature and its personality established.  Somewhere around line

98 As you can probably tell, there is enormous problems with the phone line
99 right now, if you managed to get thru, congradulations, you are truly
100 determined. But please, if you are having problems, noisy line, getting
101 dumpped, ect. as seems to be the case with everyone right now, CALL THE
102 PHONE COMPANY! Tell them what you are experiencing. The number to call
103 is 470-xxxx tell them you are having problems when you call 230-xxxx,
104 and describe them. I have been calling them everyday, but they have been
105 a bit lacidazial about it. So, on the squeaky wheel theory, CALL THEM!
106 If you call and all you get is a busy signal, be patient, the problem
107 is a parial short some place that comes and goes. Sometimes it locks
108 up for several hours, other times it just shorts out long enough to
109 dump you off line. So keep trying, and please, REPORT IT TO THE PHONE CO.
110 when it happens! It isn't going to get better until they get off their
111 duffs and decide that their really is something wrong. SO CALL!
112 Thank you.
113 ************************** CISTOP MIKEY ******************************
114 P.S. It doesn't hurt to call more then once. Like I said, I've been
115 calling once a day. If they get enough calls maybe they'll decide
116 to do something.

119 Farley : I can still fill you in on everything that has transpired, even if
120  you tried to call twice yesterday, and missed me both times. I was busy
121  turning green yesterday, after the PC&S meeting. You missed meeting a very
122  rare-in-appearing person, a person that has an interesting personality. But
123  not to worry, I am sure you and the person in question will meet up very
124  soon.
125 Piper : Respond on La Nerd? AOK.
126 Voyeur : Monday I will check in and get as much documentation as possible. 
127  Since your friend is in town for awhile, we can probably meet once more
128  before he leaves. The house was awfully quite last night. Did you notice
129  it too?
130 Kosta : We discussed the possibility of a new direction for the current
131  story, but nothing will happen until your are consulted. Gaudy will get
132  the word later today.

142 THOR was getting irritated at the phantom at the INN. Five times he had
143 had his chair pulled out from beneath him and it was becoming unnerving.
144 THOR's patience was stretched to its breaking point and he wanted to place
145 his hands on the phantoms neck just
146 long enough to feel the bones become mush in his fingers.
147 too much, even as he thought it the phantom had the nerve to do it AGAIN.
148 I will leave the INN and come back when this monster has no more victims to
149 prey upon and tires with the boredom.
150 He will leave to do his dirty work in orhter establishments when he has 
151 finished searching for other souls to corrupt.

232         Big. Large. Magnificently colossal. It stood there, towering over my
233 head, like a monolith from the past. I reached out to touch it. Hard as a rock.
234 Smooth, like no rock is ever smooth. Smoother than the finest metal, far
235 reaching over gold and platinum.  I looked up. It must have been over
236 two-hundred feet taller than I, carved with designs so foreshortened by
237 perspective that I could only see clearly for about ten feet up.  The designs
238 resembled heiroglyphs, etched deeply, each filling about a square foot.  In rows
239 across the whole face. It was basically a rectangular prism, I thought, and it
240 had these designs on all four sides. I wandered around the sides.  Aha, I
241 thought, this one has been, well, corroded.  How else could it have been
242 green?  Unless copper veins... The symbol was sort of of a man holding a star.
243 However, something wasn't right about it, something I could not put my finger
244 on.  I looked at the next heiroglyph in the row.  Funny, I thought, there is
245 just a blank space. Then the next hieroglyph showed the same man, surrounded in
246 a, well, cloud of fog.  Then the next one, and he stood, and the terrain was
247 somehow different.  I followed it across to the next face, for two more
248 hieroglyphs this, well, man walked.  And walked.  Then, and this was strange,
249 he found a flower.  It looked like a flower, anyway.  In the next hieroglyphs
250 he picked it, smelled it, and died.  Or at least it looked like he died.
251 He lay down on the ground with his arms spread wide going blah.  This was
252 strange, the row ended there.  I went back to the first face.  Another
253 incongruiity.  There were none on the row between the green one.  And it
254 was in the middle of the row.  I looked on the other two faces, in the same
255 row, and there was nothing but the usual gibberish, gibberish to me anyway.
256 I went back to the green hieroglyph.  I had looked the whole thing over
257 carefully.  What the heck.  I touched the green hieroglyph.  And vanished.

278 
   Memories long suppressed tore at Arthur's mind as he sat next to  a
279 
large  oak tree in his newly formed body.  The return to this form and
280 
the renewed association with time allowed him to recall memories in an
281 
orderly fashion,  and  the  nostalgia  proceeded  in  a  chronological
282 
order. 
283 
   For  all  the joyous romps he had had as a lad, Arthur's life truly
284 
began on that day he shattered the legendary stone.  The crack of  the
285 
stone  had  rent the very fabric of history, much as Alexander had the
286 
Gorgon  knot.   The  figure  that  approached   Arthur   as   he   sat
287 
contemplating  his  future  existence stood for nearly a quarter of an
288 
hour before Arthur looked up.  The sight of  someone  else  witnessing
289 
his  horrible  deed  gave Arthur quite a start, and the sword bit into
290 
his thumb. 
291 
   "OUCH!"
292 
   "Elegant, but very crude and somewhat clumsy," the voice was tired,
293 
but familiar. 
294 
   "But it's a nice sword, and I didn't mean to, I  just...I...I  just
295 
slipped...."  Arthur's  voice  trailed  off  in  panic, muffled by his
296 
bleeding thumb. 
297 
   Merlin shook his head.  "Lying won't help you now.  You  meant  to,
298 
you  didn't slip and no one ever said the stone could not be broken in
299 
the process."
300 
   "But I...what if...how can..."
301 
   "Sputtering ill befits the king  of  the  Bretons,  boy!"  Merlin's
302 
voice  shook  the  forest, or so it seemed.  "Look boy, you got it out
303 
and that's that.  You're going to be king whether you like it or  not,
304 
so  stop bellyaching and help me avoid your first war.  If anyone else
305 
sees this, they'll think just as you did and use  you  for  tomorrow's
306 
practice  dummy.   Here,  help  me with this," and a bewildered Arthur
307 
moved toward the old man. 
308 
   They worked frighteningly  fast,  knowing  that  at  any  moment  a
309 
reveler  might  wander  away from the feast and catch them in the act.
310 
They hurriedly dug a small depression into which they  positioned  the
311 
two  halves  of the stone, and piled dirt up the sides to maintain its
312 
place.  With the stone in position, they carefully replaced the  sword
313 
so  as to appear as it had before.  Arthur watched curiously as Merlin
314 
prepared a tiny pouch and lit a small candle.  As darkness approached,
315 
there they waited until a small crowd of feastgoers appeared. 
316 
   When the merrymakers approached, Arthur grasped the sword with both
317 
of his hands, and, on cue from Merlin  began  to  fake  straining  and
318 
pulling.   The  revellers  laughed  loudly  and  merrily  at what they
319 
thought was another fool out to impress his  girlfriend.   At  another
320 
cue  from  Merlin, though, Arthur gave the sword a turn and hoisted it
321 
free of the stone.  At the same instance, there erupted a mighty flash
322 
and a loud BANG!  from the stone, which again toppled in pieces.   The
323 
chuckling  group  was  now speechless, as all color drained from their
324 
faces.  Arthur, though paralyzed with fear  at  the  proceedings,  saw
325 
then  a  sight  he  would remember for all time: Merlin, hands clasped
326 
tightly over his own mouth, turning bright red, suppressing a laugh!

333 To: All UNDERGROUND operatives
334 From: J.K. O'Hara, DSNAC, UNDERGROUND
335 Subj: A little tidbit to keep you going
336 Since morale within our ranks has been fairly low these past few days, here's
337 a little story to cheer you up:
338   
339      Captain Brommel, it was well known, was a sadist.  His intense
340   pleasure at inflicting pain could not be mistaken; his favorite place in
341  the entire prison was the torture chamber, right next to the rack.  
342  Still, he was excellent at his job, and his superiors decided years ago to
343   just look the other way when he indulged himself.
344      One day, however, a prison riot broke out.  It seems that one of the
345   prisoners, taken just the day before, had been beaten almost beyond
346  recognition during an interrogation.  The other prisoners, of course, were
347 outraged.  They suddenly charged the guards during calisthenics, and in
348  the ensuing battle, seized several firearms and shot every single guard
349  they could find.  A few guards escaped to tell their Captain what
350  had happened.  Of course, they reported everything in the long and

429 Some may think that to feel is to reach out your hand and let your
430 fingertips contact the person or thing  that you want to touch.
431 But to actually touch something or some one, you must reach out with
432 feelings not found in the tips of ones  fingers. For that touch is soon
433 forgotten by the both parties involved.
434 To feel and be felt, one must reach out with ones soul and if contact is made
435 neither party shall ever forget the
436 moment of tangency.

519 There seems to have been a fantastic improvement in the phone lines!  I 
520 managed to read the whole disk without getting mung
521 (glitch was fingers -- not fone) knocked off the line.  As we're
522 near the bottom, I'll let the story rest another day.
523   -- to the one who left the message about rebuilding consoles and
524 the proverbs.
525     Sir:
526         Your use of control characters is quite obnoxious.  I realize tt
527 what you left translates to a backspace with your terminal or atari, but
528 to the rest of it, it is just garbage.  To see what it really looks like,
529 type "cc n" (control characters, show instead of send), and reread the
530 message.  Looks pretty bad doesn't it?  To compound the problem, your
531 character that translates as "^=" puts my terminal into graphics mode --
532 it expects the character strings coming to be encoded co-ordinates.
533 Very messy.  If you want to use a backspace, the system supports the
534 standard ASCII backspace command ... a much more readable message results.
535 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
536 (damn enter only -- the line starting "to the rest of it" should be
537 "to most of us" pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
