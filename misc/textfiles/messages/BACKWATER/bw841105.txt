29 Milchar : Bah! Reduced to a go-fer this and go-fer that. Is this what I am going to college for? Is this what I am
30 staying up late into the night for? Is this what I am contemplating buying some no-doze tablets for? Is this what
31 I am pulling my hair out after having three midterms in 2 days for? Well.... I should have your magazines copied
32 by tomorrow afternoon. Maybe I can run out to your place sometime this weekend or next week sometime. As for your SAT
33 scores, you may find that you did much better than you think. Estimating how you did on a three hour exam graded as
34 the SAT is can be difficult. I was happily surprised by my English scores, while slightly upset about my Math scores.
35 I was the only person in the group of people I hung around with who didn't get a bloody 700+ on math (i got 680). I
36 got plenty of teasing about that, I assure you. Well good luck, and here's to MIT!!!
37 Mikey : A fellow grandmaster on "Big Cave"! I too am a member of that forgotten group. And I also have the FORTRAN
38 source. An interesting note is I also have a BASIC program for the Original Adventure too. Quite big, but it does work.
39 Good luck with the games. I am crossing my fingers, but I won't be too stunned if you decide otherwise. If anything else,
40 you can see what an error trapping file opener in Turbo Pascal looks like (big deal eh?)
41 Voyeur : Alas, the dice and cards were not with me. Geography is my weakest subject in that game, but I usually escape
42 by getting a question I can guess at. Saturday just didn't work out that way, and all my guesses were misses. You want
43 to know something? I would rather lose and be distracted than win and enjoy a hollow victory. (sigh)

46 	Several months pass, our heroine has just graduated from her
47 education, She is no longer the flaky kid of yesterday, She is a bontified
48 superhero. (all the fater for the slaughter heeehh heeehh) She has learned
49 of evil and goodness, she has learned some of the extensive powers of the
50 sacred trident, She has learned her trident is about 65% reliable, and it
51 is a good idea to have plan b ready when plan a falls flat.
52 	Our friend Ontho has proceded to get it's self quite fat. The young
53 duke has made several trips to Venus on orders from the old woman to get
54 bards for Ontho to munch. Ontho takes on the postion of thinker in the elder
55 community, and they trained him to be as benificial to Leo as possible.
56 	The young duke and Leo became friends but nothing like what Leo had
57 been hoping for, duke knew his role as motivator and that was it.  On her
58 last day at training school duke came in to her room with some infomation
59 on her first "assignment".  
60 	"Say, come down off the ceiling for a bit so we can discuss this."
61 the young duke said to Leo who had levatated herself to the ceiling for
62 meditaion.  "Ok be right down"  She came down easily and gracefully to land in f 
63 in front of duke. "what's up?" She inquired.  " Your first job, and your
64 first test"duke hesitated, You don't have to take this one if you don't want
65 to, you can wait another week if you want..."  Leo stamered " What's Up?"
66 	The duke then calmly said "Leo Ill be straight with you, there is
67 a confirmed threat on your life right now, venturing out could be quite
68 dangerous.
69 *************************kathy**************************************************
70 P.S.  ok, I have written 2 ends to this chapter, you get to decide, does
71 Leo take the mission, or wait untill the threat on her life passes?
72 personaly I am dying to get rid of her, but you get to chose.
73 *********************************kathy***************************************
74 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
75   hmm -- are you going to take a vote then?  OK, I'll vote to keep her 
76 around but out on the adventure.  Is that one you'll take?  Let her get 
77 out in the world and get some rough edges and overconfidence knocked off.
78 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
79    Milchar finally grew aware of the growing mood of rebellion building
80 up in the party.  The morning had dwindled into nothing, noon had arrived
81 and passed with no sign of a break.  Songs and stories had relieved the
82 monotony of travel for a while, but the twin pressures of hunger and 
83 hydraulics had the entire company quite restive.  Perhaps it was the sund
84 of the entire company of mounts (highly amused at the idea, as they had
85 their own solution to the problem -- much to the dismay of anyone below) 
86 chanting POTTY BREAK! POTTY BREAK! in bass unison.
87   Somehow, the piper thought, the thing that finally got through to Milchar,
88 however was the fact that the whole party peeled off to the left and landed
89 in a large meadow that appeared in the jungle below.  Some fifteen minutes
90 later he landed with his mount, disapproval plain on his face, urgency
91 making him move quickly.  The company was spread over the grassy meadow,
92 some laying back on the soft grass, a few tossing a strange disklike object
93 back and forth, a few deep in conversation with their mounts.  Friar Mossbac
94 had a portable grill set up in the shade at one side and a tempting smell
95 was beginning to waft over the party.

104  
105      As I enter the terminal, I find that it isn't the terminal from which
106 I departed, but more a large reception room with three tables along one
107 side.  Lined up behind two of the tables are the remnants of the other
108 passengers of my ill-fated flight home, those in front expressing various
109 degrees of outrage and anger, and those behind waiting impatiently for
110 their turn to vent their mounting frustration on the hapless
111 representatives of the airline.  The third table is off to the side, and
112 empty except for a telephone and a few folding chairs.
113  
114      "That table is a likely spot!" I remark, and rapidly head toward it
115 with my two plastic bags and Tawny in tow.  I sit down, and Tawny
116 reluctantly sits next to me.  She seems somewhat ill at east, so I pull one
117 of the small bottles out (a Chablis from California, one year old), break
118 out two of the plastic cups, and pour.  Taking a sip, I begin to steal from a
119 favorite Monty Python sketch.  "Ah, Chateau Blue has won many prises, not
120 least for its taste and its lingering after-burn."  She smiles a bit and
121 takes a sip, so I continue.  "Of course, the Australian Wino Society
122 recommends a 1970 Cot Deu Rod Laver."  Another smile.  "Another good
123 fighting wine is Melbourne Alden Yellow, which is particularly heavy,
124 should only be used for hand to hand combat, and is especially good for
125 those keen on regurgitation."  We both fall into silly laughter at this
126 point, and I soon open another of these tiny bottles.
127  
128      "Excuse me," a distinguished looking gentleman sniffs at us, "but I am
129 wondering if you ladies could break away from your obviously important work
130 to help one of your passengers."  He apparently thinks that we both work
131 for the airline (we are, after all, sitting behind a table and have a
132 telephone in front of us, and Tawny is wearing the uniform of the airline.
133 I am in a business suit, so I must be an executive of the airline), and I
134 have had enough wine by this point to play along.
135  
136      "How can I help you, sir?" I ask in my most businesslike voice.
137  
138      "I would like to use this telephone to make a local call.  That is, if
139 it won't disturb you too much."  By his attitude and the tone of his voice
140 I have already decided that I don't like him.
141  
142      "Of course, sir, but you will have to deposit twenty-five cents.  This
143 is a pay telephone."
144  
145      "Hrrmph!  Fine, fine, but where do I put the money?"  He responds.
146  
147      I indicate a small crack in the table near the 'phone, just about the
148 right size.  "Right in there, sir."
149  
150      He reaches into his pocket, retrieves a quarter, and drops it into the
151 crack in the table.  It falls through and hits the floor with a tinkle.  I
152 reach down, pick the quarter up, hand it to him and say, "Thank you, sir!
153 Go right ahead!"  He makes his call, all the while eyeing me as if I might
154 suddenly become dangerous.  Tawny and I return to the wine, and after he
155 has left we both get a severe attack of the giggles.
156  
157      "What a twerp!" Tawny gasps, out of breath.
158  
159      Though my sides still ache from laughing, I am already feeling sorry
160 for what I did to the man.  Certainly he was an overstuffed, self-important
161 boor, but the balloon of an overblown ego should be slowly deflated rather
162 than popped.  Not to worry though, he didn't even seem to realize that he
163 was being teased.  And that's the sad thing.
164  
165      I look over and see that the line is now growing much shorter.  Soon I
166 should at least make an effort to talk to the agents, find a place to sleep
167 for the night, and arrange for a flight on whatever airline they can put me
168 on.  But the line is still long, and we have wine to finish, jokes to tell,
169 and hopefully a new friendship to nourish.

173 {           
174       Frasher started walking down to his hotel room about
175 3:00am after he got in from the airport.As he walked by the     garage he noticed a strange sound comming from the 1st level
176 so he got in the lobby and into the elevator.He stopped,then he pressed level 3 the third level garage.He walked over to check
177 and see if his car was allright.Yes it was allright no damage   That night he walked back to his room and unlocked his door,ve
178 ry quitly so he would not desturb the others.He quickly went in.
179 closed the door.Shut all the windows.The phone rang!!.He answered it in a scared voice "H-h-h hello?"
180 "Is this Mr.Jim Frasher?".Said the voice
181 "Yes,and who is this?".Jim replied.
182 "TThat is no importance right now."
183 "Well who are you,WHY are you calling at 3:30am?"
184 "I am calling because you reported a noise down at garage level #3 ,is that right?" She said.
185 "No no wait a minute.How did you know i was down on level #3??#"
186 "I knew because when i was pwalking down to check and see if you were one of them!!".She said very confused
187 "oOne of them???".He was also confused.
188 "Yes,well you know,i really should get some sleep now,we will discuss it in the morning".
189 "but,but who are you,how did you know my-".Then he heard a dial tone.
190                That night Frasher could not sleep a wink.It was already 5:30 almost time for him to go to his buisness meeting
191 in the morning.He got up out of bed,got dressed,and went down to his car.It was quite in the hotel halls.He quikly got in the 
192 elevator and closed the door.He went to level #3.Then elevator stopped.He got out.He notice something very strange ,different.
193 He was frightened walked back with his hands over his mouth.Then got in the elevator.
194 suddenly, he realized what was wrong. HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO PUT HIS PANTS ON! "Gasp!" he said, and without a moments
195 hesitation, pushed the button for level #5. "I should be able to sneak back to my room from there", he thought to himself.
196 "How could I forget my pants? What was I thinking of? And why am I spending so much time rationalizing anyway?
197 Could this be the time of rekoning he had dreamed about in the past? Could the hear and know be the time Frasher went to
198 meet is maker? "It must be!", he thought out loud to himself. "I must prepare then. All the schooling in the world
199 will not help me one iota in a situation like this. Level #5 announced itself with a ring and the opening of a
200 door. He entered the hall, which fortunatly was desearted, and made his way to his room. Within his room, he found his
201 missing pair of pants, and quickly and silently redressed. After finishing this little episode, he returned via the elevator
202 to the level #3 below, and to his car, which sat on the same horizontal plane. Starting the car with a roar, he speed out
203 of the building onto the street. Depressing his foot on the gas, his car increased speed as it picked up
204 momentum. He was now on his way to meet his destiny on a lonly road outside of a nameless town known only as, Clevelend.

213 Well, as of 7 PM, it looks like Reagan may just possibly be pulling it off.
214 While I admit to having voted for him (lesser of two evils, you know, and
215 *I* don't have the (fortitude?) to vote for NOTA), I sure wish that
216 Falwell & the 'Moral Majority' weren't coming into power on his coattails.
217 Now THAT disturbs me like Rayguns playing with nukes and star wars weapons never did.
218 Leonard: Did you happen to discover a silver pen behind your sofa?
219 I dropped my coat there Saturday, and the pen was in the pocket.  Yesterday I
220 discovered that it was gone, and that is the most likely place for it.
221 It has some sentimental value (I've had it for an Awful lot of years),
222 and I'd hate to lose it.
223 So you had to take a cab, huh?  Missed your bus?  How much is a taxi these days?
224 Last time I rode in one was 1964 in NYC, and as an 11-year old, I wasn't much
225 interested in such details.  Now, however, it could be useful knowledge.
226 PAM: Another entry!?  I'm in shock!

229 I couldnt't stop thinking about the people we had just left and Mariani's dark
230 face as he watched us depart.  At over nine feet, he towered above his people,
231 the Kalai.  His powerful frame toiled with devotion to the brood; his broad
232 face contorted with concern.  He worried about disease, housing, the appear-
233 ance of blue and purple rays in the night sky, food, and now about these ami-
234 able but foolish strangers.  Mariani never worried about himself.
235      One of the  Kalai had told   Friar and me the  story of  their liberation.
236 The delicate Kalai had been forced to dive for pearls until exhausted by a 
237 wizard, Blue Demon, who bullied them with his power to pollute the water. 
238 With a compelling mix of animal strength, magic, and sheer rage Mariani
239 had snatched the yellow necklace from the wizard's throat, but the demon
240 had escaped with the other part.  Blue Demon was said to rule by cunning
241 and deceit and was a master of logic and double-talk. (Consequently, Mar-
242 that only someone much smarter and better than they could percieve their
243 imperfections since they themselves certainly hadn't noticed them. When they
244 heard that we were going to look for Blue Demon, the Kalai sent their best
245 wishes and gave us lovely pink pearls to use in trade.  Only Mariani worried
246 about the deadly water and the return of Blue Demon.
247      I am glad Milchar is insisting that we hurry.  We dare not be late
248 in returning the necklace (although it is unnerving to have a telepathic
249 steed.  I THINK she's a steed. I think she's a she.  She is lovely and
250 the Friar is mounted on her mate. If they have mates. ) The Friar is
251 quite cheerful, and I suspect he looks forward to some sort of verbal
252 encounter with the wizard. The Kalai had repeated (without understanding)
253 the wizard's saying, "Look for many meanings."  I am anxious to proceed.
254 UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU Lila UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

256 L'homme: A basic version?? BLAHH! The only other version I have is the 
257 disassembled source to the 8080 assembler version that was running
258 around on the CPM systems for a while. (Actually it is the Heath H-8
259 version which runs 8K higher then the CPM version. The CPM version
260 has a patch at the bottom to setup the restarts and jmp to the entry point.
261 This is the version that wouldn't allow you to save the game image.)
262 Kathy: Why not just drop Leo and create a new character if you don't like Leo?
263 Just put Leo on ice until you need her for some other story.
264 Leonard: The reason for 'killing' the 1771 (forced interrupt) is that when
265 the 1771 receives a hardware reset, it tries to restore the head to track 0
266 at the slowest rate. It does this until it sees the track 0 indicator, or
267 it has tried 255 steps. Since the drive isn't selected, the track 0 indicator
268 never gets seen, so the 1771 keeps trying for 255 steps. This takes about
269 15-20 seconds to do. Thus the forced interrupt is used to tell it to stop 
270 that nonsense, and let us continue on with other things.
271 PAM: Your story got a smile out of me. Thank you.
272 Debaters: Well, I went to the voting booth, and looked at the ticket.
273 I had been wondering if I really would carry thru with my stated intent
274 of voting for none-of-the-above for president. I took care of all the
275 other offices and measures, then went back and starred once more at the
276 position of president. I finally decided that I could not in good faith
277 vote for either one of the given parties. Thus with one fell swoop of
278 my pen I voted for my stated preference of none-of-the-above.
279 Sigh... I'm glad it's over.

281 All: Mondale conceded to Reagan about 2 hrs ago (8pm PST).
282 Mikey: AHA! that explains some things about the old Model I boot process!
283  I regret to inform you that at least one line of one of your "penciled in"
284 subroutines got cut off. I've got :
285 STWAT   IN       TST
286         ANI     ?? (unreadable, 0 something or other)
287         JNZ     cut off by edge of page (I'm guessing about the JNZ)
288 next page starts with 
289         JMP     STEST
290  (the page in question is the 5th (0315-044B)
291        I see that it is going to be tricky putting the LF *AFTER* the CR.
292 Oh well ....
293 
294 Voyeur: Sorry, no pen (I just looked). I'll check & see if anyone else found 
295 it.
296 As for the Archives, it FINALLY dawned on me that ALL the files end on sector
297 boundaries. Thus I can open them as RANDOM files with record length 256. This
298 makes things MUCH easier!
299         I'll have to give you and L'homme a copy of the CIS A protocol. It allows
300 variable length blocks & error checking. 
301 TMA: I found your umbrella hanging from the computer room's doorknob. It's 
302 still there. Any ideas on how to return it?

313 
314 Sounds like you know a bit about disk drives, too, from that
315 last message.  I think it was from you, anyway.  What kind of
316 stuff have you hung on the computer?  Mine is, actually, a VER
317 SION A board, with the 48K internal RAM board from Holmes Engin-
318 eering, homebrew clock mod, home-done video deglitcher, two driv
319 es (one flippy), the drive interface from the Micro Mint (Disk-
320 80), an early LYNX 300-baud DC modem, and 9" Comrex amber moni-
321 tor.  And, the best part is, all this ancient stuff Still Works.
322 I've even got the CPU board in a seperate metal case, and the
323 keyboard is on a 6-foot coiled cord (used to be long ribbon
324 cable but that was too awkward).  I just finished raepairing it
325 for the Nth time about two hours ago... one of the strands in 
326 the Level II ROM board ribbon cable had broke.  Weird - there's
327 never any stress on that thing.  Anyway, gotta leave before the

335 Well, Mr Reagan has his mandate, Isn't it strange how people forget two
336 years ago and 12% unemployment but don't forget Iran (where all came home alive 
337 and safe). I don't remember who said it but a good quote at this time would
338 be "Give a man a couple of good meals and he forgets that he was starving"......
339 Personally, I feel that the mandate has moved this great country back at least 
340 50 years, Civil rights, ERA, and those not "born again" have been
341 disenfranchised!!! The only good news is that he didn't bring in a right
342 wing congress with him.......

346 Yes, isn't it strange how people are against the liberal policies
347 of the democrates that left this country in a resesion. Yes it is
348 strange that they would vote back in someone who has managed to

355 Don: It wasn't the liberal policies of the democrats that was
356 responsible for the recession. It was the Vietnam War, which
357 was hardly a liberal policy.
358 
359 Of course, Johnsons policies of fighting the war on credit, 
360 rather than raising taxes to pay for it, is the real cause 
361 of the recession. We're paying the price for the incredible
362 debt he got us into.
363 
364 I don't recall either the republicans or democrats demanding
365 we raise taxes to finance the war on a pay as you play basis.
366 Everybody wanted to put it on credit so later generations 
367 could foot the tab. You are among that later generation. You
368 got screwed by everybody...not just the democrats.

413 (put the repeat ON this time for the plus signs)
414 L'homme: You mean that's NOT what you went to college for?
415 Prometheus: I had taken that as granted the second I read the entry above yours.  Perhaps your next 'first impression'
416 will turn out better.
417 +++++++++++++
418 With the rest of the group chanting away, I consented to a stop, grumbling about 'lost time'.  I consoled myself in
419 saying that if we had to fight in another battle it would do us no good to be tired, and I somehow accepted it.
420 Suddenly I realized how hard I had been pushing the others.  I took a good hard look at Lila, the Friar, Piper, Bard, 
421 Poet, and the others, and saw their fatigue displayed in their every move.  I examined myself, and found I could barely
422 summon the energy to walk.  The only thing keeping me consious seemed to be some sort of support radiating from the 
423 necklace.  I held onto it, for it was all I had.
424 The others enjoyed the stop, for we had found one of the few strips of beach which had any vegetation at all.  This one
425 was fortunate enough to have a few trees, something rare hereabouts.  I took it all in, but could not relax.  I feared 
426 I would fall asleep if I did, and waste even more time.  What a sour person I must have seemed to the others!
427 I was restless, and so I paced the shore of our small strip of beach, pondering the question of the dampening field
428 placed about me.  If not removed soon, I would...
429 "RRRROOOOOOOAAAAARRRRRR!!!"  An earth-shaking screech filled the air, knocking me senseless for a moment.  Falling flat,
430 I looked in the direction of the noise.  Far to the west, towards our destination, a massive bluish shape lumbered 
431 our way, ignoring the immense depths of the water as he (I think it was a he) scrambled nearer.  My magic-sense, not 
432 inactive after all, told me this was a creature of hate, destruction, and of immense sorcery.  I had nothing to combat 
433 it if it chose to attack, and little doubt remained of that.  I cursed the magic chains placed on me.  "Everyone!  
434 Prepare!  The Blue Demon spoke of is here!"  I had yelled without really realizing the words had torn loose from my
435 mouth.  Astonishment met astonishment - I saw a man of indeterminable age persuing the beast, trying desperately to 
436 turn it about.  Escaped from a prision of some sort?  From the Keystone?, I wondered, just as I fell unconsious.
437 ++++++++++++
438 As the beast neared, I saw the people scramble for their mounts.  One had fallen to the ground, an easy target for the
439 beast.  Another psychic whip had no effect on Barkahni, he was possessed by the need to have something down there.  I 
440 cursed my bad luck again.  If I hadn't been stationed to this post, perhaps I would have been promoted by now.  This 
441 incident will surely put me at the bottom of D's list.  Frotz, this job wasn't that easy!  Constant watching over this 
442 thing, foregoing sleep at times... and now this, and only after 1 drink!  Sometimes I wonder if existance is worth it.
443 I sure felt sorry for that poor sucker on the ground.  Perhaps if I... no, too risky... but if I save a life... what 
444 the hell, my life is gone as of now anyway...
445 Summoning all of my remaining will, Shouting the words, I uttered: "Ehonv, Degtk, Fika- Novar coma zaat!"  I rather 
446 liked the ring of my name in the spell, but didn't bother to appreciate it at the moment.  Something was happening.
447 The air shimmered, the ground changed its colors rapidly, and the Beast itself faded from view... It worked!  Where he
448 went I knew not, but I could worry about him later.  Now I must find out about these strangers.
449 I floated down gently.  A man near a Pegasus (my, been a long time since I've seen one of those) seemed to be in 
450 charge at the moment.  I said, "Greetings, and long life.  I am Novar, ex-keeper of the Blue Demon.  He is gone for now.
451 Why are you in the Sapphire Valley?"
452 "We are travelling, seeking the last piece of the necklace about our friend's neck."  The man seemed to be telling the
453 truth.  A short Detect Lie confirmed it.  Wait...necklace... D's project!  Better keep quiet, I reminded myself.  
454 People who messed with D's projects found themselves in very awkward positions.  I was determined to not be one of them.
455 "The last piece lies ahead, you need but do one thing... how is your friend there?"  I reconized the person there, 
456 a mage named Milchar.  Top of his class, not that there were many in his class.  I thought I had heard some standing
457 orders about him, but I had forgotten them.  Oh well.
458 "He lies in coma.  I don't know why.  Could you take us somewhere where he may rest, and we talk?"  He seemed worried 
459 about the chill.  The sun was setting, and dark would come soon.
460 "Of course.  Please follow me, to rest, warmth, food, and drink!"  I flew westward at a fairly slow pace.

463 Grattus hopped onto the wagon and took the reins into is palms and gripped the leather in the perfect manner.
464   Ascomb knew this was going to happen, and was still ounging in the couch. One twist though. The couch was strapped
465 atop the wagon.
466   It actually seemed that quite everything in the galaxy that was ever lost, might be found attached to the wagon in som
467 manner.
468   S-FTEY was also tied to the wagon. Well, actually the wagon was tied to him, and so was the couch. But it is all very
469 confusing. So let's not go into it.
470   As Grattus twisted the leather in his palms, the horseless wagon started to rock and shake. Inside heir were boards
471 plying themselves loose, and dust thrown askew everywhere.
472   S-FTEY notified Grattus, by making his left toenail curl, that there was a dweomer-ripple going through them.
473   A dweomer-ripple is a swirl in mental energy caused by use of magic. As th magic fluctuates, so does the ripple.
474   After finding their way above the ripple, the former inhabitants of Limbo Road decided to land.
475   But when you have a wagon that lands through thought patterns one doesn't speculate too hard about where to land.
476   But Ascomb did, and  because she did, the wagon came to rest. It was dark, and cold with null gravity and wind.
477   They had landed in a place we call, the upper atmosphere. I guess the didn't *LAND* after all.
478   S-FTEY thought he could see lights in their approxamate landing pad...

488 I took a look at my previous entry on the 5th and noticed it
489 was quite messed up.  please don't tamper with my entries, I
490 don't tamper with yours. As far as keeping Leo around I have
491 one vote to keep her and put her out on an adventure and one
492 vote to put her on ice. Well i don't hate    Leo so much as 
493 to keep her in suspense over her fate so the ice trick is out.
494 I think Ill send her out on the mission as soon as the sysop
495 purges the files again. Although Leo knows for some reason
496 there is a little black cloud over her head for a reason that
497 she is quite unsure of.  She confided to me earlier." I think
498 the gods are in some kind of competion that I am an unwilling
499 participant, sigh,"
500 note to pam: if i was an old guy in an airport I wouldn't fall
501 for dropping a coin into a crack in the table to satisfy a 
502 couple of drunken wenches... just a thought, with no substance
503 really.....

506   Milchar -- I left the pegasus behind in the ruby valley.  I certainly hope
507 you don't intend to take a short cut home!
508 ppppppppppppppppppppppppp
509 kathy -- having been the victim of some twit's misguided meddling myself,
510 I can only sympathize.  Unfortunately, part of the freedom that this type 
511 of environment gives is also the environment that allows others to tamper.
512 Sometimes the best reaction is to ignore and endure -- the tamperers rarely
513 have the endurance to stick around -- particularly if you realize that part
514 of the reason for tampering is to provoke a reaction.  People soon quit using
515 tampering as an attention-getting device if all it gets them is ignored.

520      Finally arrangements have been made for a place to stay, to eat, and a
521 flight the next afternoon, all at the expense of the airline.  The agents
522 have been remarkably helpful, much more than I would have thought, and they
523 tell me that my bags will be delivered to the hotel this evening.  With
524 everything finally taken care of, the tensions and stress of the previous
525 week descend on me all at once.  I'm so tired!
526  
527      I return to the table where I had previously waited, and when Tawny
528 sees me coming she raises her cup as if toasting me, and then when I get
529 closer she stands and a concerned look crosses her face.
530  
531      "Is everything all right?"  She asks.  "You look awful!"
532  
533      "One of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me.  No, I think
534 that everything is just catching up with me."  I collapse into the folding
535 chair, grab a cup, and pour myself some wine.  "Where are you staying?
536 Perhaps we can get a cab together."
537  
538      "Same place you are," she states while taking my cup from me, "we have
539 an account there for employees and any passengers that we need to provide
540 rooms for.  You don't need more wine tonight."
541  
542      "Always the helpful attendant, eh?  I s'pose you're right though, what
543 I really need is sleep.  They've provided a bus for passengers, but I've
544 been in enough lines today.  Let's go get that cab!"  I stand up quickly,
545 then sit down just as quickly.  "And right again," I grin sheepishly, "I
546 don't need any more wine."
547  
548      "Good!  What you REALLY need tonight is a little therapy.  The hotel
549 has a resident masseuse, and he's very good."  A quick smile.  "Gay, too,
550 but he doesn't hate women, just wouldn't marry one."
551  
552      "Sounds just like my kinda guy!" I laugh.  "Let's go.  He can beat me
553 up, and you can put me to bed."  I stand up (slowly this time), grab what's
554 left of the wine and cups, and we go to flag a cab.

558      Kathy - I left a comment on the end of a previous disk directed to
559 you, but I can't be sure you saw it.  I just wanted to thank you for your
560 kind words, and welcome you to the Inn.  Don't let any negative (as opposed
561 to constructive) criticism you may attract bother you, since no matter what
562 you do or say there will be someone who won't like it.  Those that can, do,
563 and those that can't become critics.  Your work is good, and becomes better
564 with each entry.  Don't kill off your character, find a way to make her
565 more interesting to you.  Or leave her alone for awhile, maybe you'll think
566 of something to do with her later.  Whatever you decide though, keep
567 writing!
568  
569      Voyeur, yes I am making more entries than I have in quite some time.
570 Guess the ol' creative juices are flowing a bit more now than they have for
571 awhile.  By the way, you asked me a question in regard to an entry I made
572 many months ago, and I never responded.  Yes, the events that I related
573 were reality and not merely creative writing, and I'm sorry that I didn't
574 respond to you when you asked.  Depressing events tend to make me
575 depressed, and I was just too busy feeling sorry for myself to be polite.
576 Sorry 'bout that.
577  
578      Thanks for the welcome, Milchar!  It's good to be back.  "Intelligence
579 level nominal"?!  Would you please kick that computer of your's for me?
580 Sheesh!  I hope it meant "satisfactory" and not "insignifigant"!
