5 GENERAL DISCLAIMER: BWMS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INFORMATION PLACED ON
6                     THIS SYSTEM.
7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privatly owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system.
10 It is intended that the system be normally used for messages and
11 advertisments by the users. As the system is privatly owned, I retain the
12 right to remove any and all messages which I may find offensive
13 to me. Additionally because of the limited size of the system, it will be
14 periodically purged of older messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
15 The saved information will be cycled to drive 'B' while the information on
16 drive 'B' will be archived, and a fresh disk will be installed in drive 'A'.
17 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out
18 of the enter mode. The message is automaticly stored.
19 If after entering the message you find you made a mistake,
20 use the replace command to replace the line.
21 To exit from the system, type 'OFF' then hang up.
22 Type 'HELP' to see other commands that are available on the system.

25 Leonard: See bottom of drive B. What he said. Also now that I see that,
26 some more things come flowing back. As it was told to me by the Teletype
27 guy, the mark and space was two frequencies. 1800Hz and 1400Hz (I don't
28 remember which was mark and which was space,) and that the carrier was
29 turned off between characters transmitted. The system runs half duplex,
30 meaning that both transmitter and receiver work on the same frequencies.
31 thus the reason for turning off the carrier between characters.
32 This was all told to me over the phone to the Teletype guy over 5 years
33 ago, so I could very well be misinformed as to the specifics.

53 Tuatha (which as I recall means "children"?!), please don't use
54 the Form Feed. This system sends it back out as a LOOONG string
55 of Line Feeds. It is rather difficult to read a line that scrolls
56 off screen almost as soon as it appears! 
57 I'll try to find out what you said after I clean up the
58 download.

60 Mike, I don't suppose that 50 baud would work? My UART won't go
61 any slower. It WILL handle 5 bit words, tho! In any case, I may
62 try to get a "modem" built. Any suggestions will be welcome
63 (that goes for EVERYONE!).

69 to SYSM:
70    the 255 prefix is a new electronic switcher, and should be similar
71 to most new equipment in the Bell system, at least as is used
72 in larger cities. you may have noticed the changeover to the new
73 equipment a few months ago.
74    For your RF interference problem, you will need to follow standard
75 RF sheilding practice similar to what ham radio operators use, so books
76 on ham radio stuff are good sources. Basicly, you will want to shield
77 everything inside a closed metal case, or use shielded (coax type) cables.
78 Filter the phone line through small inductors (RF chokes), and bypass
79 the RF to your common system ground through .1 mfd or so capacitors from
80 both sides of the line. Keep everything connected to the line fully
81 balanced. Use of transformer connection is very good, both by being
82 balanced, and by not passing RF. Keep all bypass leads SHORT, same for
83 all leads on the equipment side of any filters. If only one station
84 interferes, a tuned trap may be more effective. You might try putting
85 some ferrite beads on the line; Radio Shack just added these to their
86 line, or get large ones at Portland Radio.

89 To Whom it may concern
90    My recent instalation of a D.C. Hayes 80-103A Modem
91    led me to discover a 170 volt A.C. Potential to ground
92    on my phone line.  Also When the Modem Makes a connection
93    there is a back ground 60 cycle hum.  The modem is isolated
94    with a 60 ohm transformer and a opto isolator.  The phone 
95    company says that the A.C. voltage is normal in rural 
96    comunities where phone lines paralell power lines.
97    However I believe This to be the cause of my 60 cycle
98    interference. If anyone has ever encountered a similar
99    problem I would appreciate a suggestion.
100                                              Sincerly

172 Leonard: No, 50 baud won't work. If you are lucky you might
173 squeze it through at 50 without a modem, but with a modem
174 it would distort the signal too much. Suggest you use a 555
175 timer, the speed is low enough that it should work ok. Do
176 use a stable capacitor though. I.E. no ceramic or electrolitic
177 types. a plastic type would be best.

251 My preferences in women?  Well, being one, and not having lesbian tendancies, I would have to say I prefer those that are
252 willing to be friends, care about me and my life, but not want to make my decisions for me or tell me what to do. 
253 Advise, yes.  Orders, no.  My computer? I don't have one.  I'm using my boyfriend's terminal on the sly.  I will have one
254 eventually ( Some day my PC will come! ), but until then, occasional visits to the lands of MPU will have to do.

495 I'm selling my Radio Shack Direct Connect Modem I for $85
496 dollars. 
497 It will work with ANY computer having an RS-232C. For the
498 person who buys this, I will give them a list of local and
499 non-local bulletin board systems. Users of the Radio Shack
500 Model I will get a free terminal program that allows:
501 Local echoing, Other user echoing, Upload/Download, Linfeed
502 after carriage return and Spool to printer. Model III users
503 who
504 call will also get a copy of this program for the Model III.
505 I will help anyone install it. It comes with the FULL package
506 which includes: Box, Modem, Transformer, Doccumentation and
507 help for installing it. Call 695-xxxx anytime and ask for Chris
508 or leave a message on any of the bulletin board systems for
509 Chris Bradley. Oh yes, it also has both Answer and Originate at
510 0-300 baud. In A-1 condition. First caller gets it.......

512 Why does the forwarding to #2 cancel the
513 call forwarding? Something some inspir-
514 ed programmer built into the phone com-
515 pany?

518 Mikey...what mode does the BWMS enter wh
519 en you exit? I'd like to know because fo
520 r some reason it inhibits me from using
521 the log off function in my modem program
522 . Thanks.

525 any poets out there?

535 FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN ON THIS PAMS THE BWM
536 whats this apparently UPPER case does
537 weird things ..... oh well ....
538 
539 From what I've seen on the PAMS so
540 far BWMS is a relative phenomena ....
541  there's not a high level of 
542 sophistication, but it's a lot more
543 interesting in free form then the 
544 others I've been in so far .......
545 
546 could it be a fixation?

550      Yes, the phone company didn't want telephones forwarded to each other primarily because they didn't want a
551 continuous, infinite loop.  Most programmers avoid situations such as:
552       10 GOTO 20
553       20 GOTO 10
554 After all, who wants their system fouled up by accidental (or otherwise) misuse?

565 Balloting now in progress to RENAME THIS BBS!  Entries will be judged on 
566 degree of appropriateness and wit, and propriety!  Don't go for cute or crude.
567 And, for the love of disks, take only ONE LINE for your entry and ID.  Explan-
568 ation of suggested name not necessary: if it's any good, it'll stand on its 
569 own.   Winner will be announced at CBBS Pizza Party and receive worthwhile

599  Come come, surly you are more preceptive then that! Can you

605  Renaming ol' venerable BWMS?! Oh come now! You really are a
606 presumtious one. Besides attempts at installing a new name on
607  this electronic misconception are really pointless, for the
608  sign-on when the system first comes up is in ROM and cannot be
609  changed. Besides, no matter what you call it, it will always
610  be the 'metsyS egasseM retaWkcaB'.
