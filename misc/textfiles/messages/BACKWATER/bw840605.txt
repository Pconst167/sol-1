23 The lazy one looked at the shambles which had been the best stocked cellar
24 on this whole world. Cursing he said I'd offer to restore it but there is
25 just no magical substitute for proper aging. Perhaps Fast Fred can help us
26 replace some of the stock. He seems to have some trade connections.

39 L'homme: I forsee no problem giving you transport Saturday, barring
40 any complications arising from (not) detouring via bard's place.
41 In other words, if the 'group' stops there, I would like to too.
42 ::::::
43 poor piper.  I seem to have entangled him in our group, and now our
44 group doesn't seem to be doing much.  Let's see what I can do...
45 :::::::
46 L'homme, voyeur, the bard, Dreamtoucher, Snowrunner, and piper sat (or lay,
47 in Snowrunners case) around the fire, breaking their fast on food supplied
48 by the piper.  The group was taking turns explaining to piper the events leading
49 up to the present situation. Voyeur told how, while admiring a deck of
50 Tarot cards, which turned out to be from Amber, he had been pulled through
51 into Amber by Lord Corwin.  L'homme had been in his own universe, driving his
52 'Mustang' to someplace called "Tek", when some strange passing car had somehow
53 caused his car to shift planes, also ending up in Amber.  The bard had arrived in
54 Amber using his ever-present gadgets.  Other Innhabitants had also somehow
55 made their way to Amber.  It all turned out to be a ruse, instigated by Gaius, the
56 evil brother of The Mad Actor, who was drawing the protectors of the Inn away so as to
57 be able to take over the Inn.  Everyone had subsequently tried to make their
58 way back to the Inn to protect it, with varying degrees of success.  While L'homme,
59 the bard, and voyeur were travelling in L'hommes car, it was attacked by a minion of Gaius's, causing serious damage
60 to car and crew alike.  While driving away the attackers, Dreamtoucher and his
61 wolf Snowrunner arrived, and gave aid.  They had been travelling with us since.
62 L'hommes car was operated by petroleum distillates, and the devices the bard was 
63 using to reality-shift the group was run by the power supplied by the car.  Since the last place
64 they had stopped had been deserted, they had run out of gasoline, and so were
65 stranded.  Would the piper be able to use his pipes to shift the group
66 (and L'hommes car, he is very attached to it!) back to the Inn?
67 ::::::::::::
68 Sorry about the long re-hash.  I'm not sure how much the piper has missed (if any),
69 so I thought it a good idea to give him some idea of what's been happening.

85 Alex: I also am interested in your proposed RISK game.  Unlike Whisper
86 and MiG, however, I have never played.  I have watched the game on
87 CBBS, and am curious.  If you hotshots don't mind a novice, count me in.

89 Bard: It's been a long time so my memory is somewhat thin, but I think the
90    navigation term the old salts use is 'SKIP ONE'. (re:second star to the
91    right) Your rendition was ok, just thought I'd add a little sea lore.

94    The piper listened to the summary of the group's adventures, then assured
95 them that it should be possible to remove to the inn.  "However," he cautioned
96 "I have never been able to shift inanimate objects that are not carried by
97 the person himself.  I doubt that the whole group could hold this "kar" up
98 long enough for me to move it, and I shudder to think what could happen if
99 the group were separated while traversing realities, or the distinction between
100 realities became altered while we were travelling.  If we did manage to pick
101 it up, then dropped it while travelling, it could seriously damage anyone hold-
102 ing onto it."  He thought for a moment, then smiled.  "Would this machine 
103 run on ethanol?"  The piper reached into his sporran, pulled out a dark bottle,
104 shook his head and put it back in, reached in and rummaged around some more.
105 Finally, he grunted.  "Huh.  That should do it!" and pulled out a clear quart
106 bottle filled with a transparent liquid.
107    "191 proof, clear grain ethanol!  L'Homme, if that infernal machine of 
108 yours can burtn this, we can get you on your way!"  The piper reached back 
109 into his sporran, pulling bottle after bottle until a stack of 30 or 40 lay on
110 the dusty ground before the group.
111   "I am not really too comfortable dealing with those machines, so let's see if
112 this stuff can power your contraption!"  
113 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
114 	"If it can handle nitrous oxide, I'd imagine it can handle ethanol!" said
115 bard. "If not we MAY be able to get it into my pack. 'twould take a bit of
116 rearranging though..."

122         M.i.G.,
123                 Indeed the rules of RISK just beg for modification. I have 
124 played several oddball combinations of the game - Prehistoric ( you start with
125 just one tribe of 5 men - to - Post Nuclear where various regions are 
126 contaminated and can't be crossed without severe troop losses ). The current
127 variation we are playing is The Nuclear Option ... where the player has 
128 the option when he turns in his cards to  A) get the normal amount of armys
129 or  B) take a warhead instead ( however it must be based on a country he owns
130 and can only be targeted with the other cards he holds ) there are a host of
131 other conventions that are associated with this version as to make it a true
132 Option not a requirement. I have played some 27 such games and so far there is
133 no clear advantage to either Armys or Warheads.....just depends on the game.
134 As for your age ....not to worry they allow minors so long as the don't 
135 imbibe ...but should you wish to sample a few of the fine ales & stouts ...I 
136 am sure something could be arranged . . . . .
137         Whisper, 
138                 Jupiter Risk ! ! ! ..... Thats one variation I have never 
139 played, at least not by that name. It sounds ingenious. What are its 
140 conventions ? Does it require a special board ? Do provide me with more 
141 detail, I am always open to new variations - The more oblique the better -
142 I have contemplated for some time on an extraterrestrial version with no
143 sucess. I look forward to your variation.
144         Voyer,
145                 Need not worry about a lack of experience. Often a new player
146 has an unprejudiced view of the board. Whereas an experienced player may 
147 know of a good low probability gambit and decide against defending or 
148 attacking via that method , a novice will often succeed by an oversight on
149 the part of the more experienced player. One caution however............
150 This game can be addictive.   
151                 We have 4 players so far.......  Any other takers at the INN ?
152  
153 ::::::::::::::::Alex:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
154 Alex: Jupiter risk requires three(3) standard RISK boards (minimum). You just
155 arrange the boards in a line (or triangle) Alaska on one board hooks up to
156 Kamchatka on the ADJACENT board & the end board "wraps" to the other end!
157 	It provides for some amusing incidents. I have heard of a 5 board session
158 where while everyone ele was nibbling away here & there, one enterprising player
159 conquered an entire board! After that the fun really started!

184 Hi folks.  Remember me?
185 Here's one for today:
186 	A standard chess board is truncated by removing two corner
187 squares diagonally opposite each other.  Can thirty-one dominoes, each able
188 to cover two adjacent squares, be used to cover all sixty-two squares of
189 the truncated chessboard?  If so, how?  If not, why not?
190 	The PORSFIS meeting is tomorrow, is it not?  There is a fair
191 chance I will be there.

194 Quiz: I'll work on it later.
195 Riskers:  I'm not into playing, but I enjoy watching a good game.  Back where
196 I come from they play a REAL risk game. They've taken a rand-mcnally world
197 map and sectioned it of into 200+ contries in several continents.  They call
198 it Mega-risk. Other normal rules apply, but it is a killer.  I've seen it
199 strech from friday night to sunday afternoon (rotating players as partners, 
200 play is continuous).  That alone convinced me not to play (don't have the
201 nerve).
202 @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
203      It was a sad sight indeed.  The celler was indeed a shambles.  Somebody
204 must have been after the Inn, after all, what would ants want with the 
205 bevarages.  "Well, look at it this way," I interjected, "Now we have something
206 to work for.  If it's more alcohol we need, it's alcohol we'll get.  Sounds
207 like a truely noble quest for this group.  Who's with me for going for the
208 new supply?"

219 Risk Players :  I too am interested...Although I am not the novice voyeur is,
220 I have never played in the marathons some of you write about. Count me in!!!
221 Voyeur : thanks much (merci etc etc) See you saturday afternoon. I may have
222 some car parts with me, but they won't be too bulky (unless I buy that 428
223 cobra jet I was looking at the other day)...
224 Bard : GREAT! When does the money from all those grateful m100 owners start
225 rolling in???
226 *($)#@*$#
227 "If it burns, it'll run in this engine. Don't you know that Holly makes one
228 of the most adjustable tunable carbs around? I am sure a little timing,
229 compression, and jet adjustment will do it. Fortunatly the engine block is
230 made of a special alloy called FoMoChrome. The pistons and rings will take
231 upwards of 20:1 (hey this is fiction right?) compression, so we should have
232 no trouble at all. I won't ask where all those bottles come from though. I
233 never look a gift piper in the chanter!"
234 With those words, L'homme started working on the car like a mad man. The only
235 words the others could make out were of the R rated kind and their associated
236 use with Ford engines. "It's a love - hate relationship", L'homme had told
237 the others before he started. While the others scouted around, L'homme worked
238 without rest. Suddenly, from over a small rise, the others heard a whinning
239 noise, and then a loud pop...This was followed by a few seconds of silence,
240 an oath, and another load pop. Finally the clear load roar of the car reached
241 their ears, and they knew immediatly L'homme was successful with his conversion.
242 When the others returned to camp, L'homme informed them that car was indeed
243 fully converted to the new fuel. "I don't know what this will do to my chrome
244 molly push rods, but it's running, and that is what is important. Where do
245 we go from here?"
246 As responses started coming from the mouths of the others, an ominous roar
247 seemed to penetrate the group's ear drums. It was like nothing L'homme had
248 ever heard before. Dwarfing the sound of the car, it seemed to come from all
249 directions. "WHAT IS IT?", mouthed L'homme to the others. I sure hope they
250 can read lips!

258 	I think I've figured it out! Many of us have been replicated and are
259 both out in the field and in the Inn. Will our two realities kill each other?
260 I think one of mine fell out a window. (I doubt if that would scratch a ninja
261 trained in falling) But he may be an imposter. How can an ant just reach out

267 HINT, HINT!!!  The Archer (Who hasn't been heard of for a while [He got into
268 touble and was grounded off his modem] might be there with us.
269 Quizmaster:  1)  I'll get to your question at a later date.
270 2)  I hope to see you Saturday (As does Milch.)
271 3)  Here's two for you:
272 Is Infinity ODD or EVEN??  The other is:  There are 3 cups of coffee.  There
273 are 14 lumps of sugar.  Using all the sugar (No cutting, eating, of crushing
274 the sugar!!) put an odd number of lumps, with a minimum of 1 lump/cup into 
275 each cup.  How many lumps go into each cup??
276 ???????????
277 On with the adventure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
278 ???????????
279   The Doctor looked at Milchar for a moment, then asked "Why do we need TWO
280 Sonic Screwdrivers??"  Milchar turned away from The Doctor, then spun around
281 and told him "Well...I always did want one...and We'll need them in my plan.
282 Along with the plans and the device that Gizmo is presently making me."  The 
283 Doctor turned to a panel, pushed a few buttons, then asked the computer for two
284 Sonic Screwdrivers and the plans to the High Council chambers.  "I'll take 
285 Psycho, and go look for the other stuff that you need."  Milchar studied the 
286 plans and the screwdrivers and said "O.K."
287 With that, The Doctor and Psycho went to The Doctor's personal miniturized
288 otable Tardis. (It looks like a V.W. with ears!!)  They entered, a faint 
289 whirring was heard, then it dissappeared.

376 Quizmaster: You can't.  Reason: Consider a whole chessboard and 32 donimoes.  Each piece, when placed on the board,
377 would cover one white and one dark square no matter what you did.  Now, the cut-up board, if you cut opposite corners,
378 is missing either TWO darks or TWO whites, which prevents you from placing the last donimoe.

380 Milchar, watching The Doctor & Psycho leaving, expereinces a terrible wave of pain.  "Oh no... the wine!  They dared
381 attack the cellar!"  Gizmo turns from his work, and stares at the mage with his eyespots for a good while.  #Don't 
382 know about this wine stuff, but your machine is ready.  Top quality, for a low-tech.#  "Thank you... Hmmm.... Aha!

410   Hey -- all you who mourn the loss of the religious arguements -- I just gt
411 a copy of Mother Earth News and there is one statement by a guy named 
412 Edward Abbey that I'll reproduce here.
413   "I wouldn't call myself an atheist because -- even though I admire the 
414 audacity, the boldness, and perhaps the basic entellectual honesty of that 
415 position -- I think it's a little risky.  It's  a little too definite.  After
416 all, they could be wrong.  There are just too many mysteries in life and inhe
417 world and in the universe to say with any certainty that their is no God ...
418 or -- in my opinion -- to endorse simple gods like the Christian conception
419 of an all-knowing, all-wise, all-powerful being.
420   In fact, mystery is the one thing that we can be sure of.  The unkown.  
421 Perhaps the forever unkowable.  And I would be willing to call that God, exept
422 that the term God seems to me too limiting.  We don't know enough to be atheists
423  -- just as we don't know enough to be theists.  I can't accept either position
424 wholeheartedly.  Also, most of those who call themselves atheists are a silly,
425 semi-fanatical bunch, not unlike the worst of fundamentalist Christians.  
426 Madalyn O'Hairs are, to me, no more appealing than Jerry Falwells ... the're
427 just fundamentalists of a slightly different stripe.
428   In short, I don't care for intitutionalized beliefs or attitudes of any sort
429 -- religions and philosophies or otherwise -- and in my writing I strive to 
430 offend them all.  And I usually succeed."

437 The Doctor and Psycho enter the mini-tardis, and he sets co-ordinates for a red sun about 293 parsecs to the galactic
438 north.  A whirring and clanking sound breaks the stillness of the air, and when it finishes, the Mtardis is there no
439 more.  
440 On a planet known as Amonode, the Mtardis shifts into "reality".  The Doctor, getting out and looking about, sees 
441 that he has arrived at the correct location and emits a sigh of relief.  Psycho has seen worse places, but right now
442 he can't seem to remember them....

445 Milchar, putting the final touches on the plan for the sceptre, stops for a moment.  He reflects on all the aventures

458 Oh no! The wine! I hope the wine spirits survived and haven't decided
459 to move out after all this violence. The wine can be replaced, but
460 not the little guys that make it the best there is.
461 The Rowan tree! Rushing outside the Innkeeper breaths a sigh of relief
462 upon seeing that other then a few superficial sorched leaves and a couple
463 of broken twigs that it survived. Ahh, that reminds me now I wonder just
464 where that barmaid of mine has gotten off to. It has been some time since
465 she has made an appearance. 
466 Have you grown tired of BW Pam? Or are you just too busy to be bothered
467 anymore? Of course the current activity has made it a bit difficult to g
468 get on of late, But I do hope that you haven't given up on us completly.
469 ######################## The Innkeeper ####################################
470 	The apprentice surveyed the shambles with disgust. SOMEONE was going to
471 have a lot of cleaning to do. Then he struck his forehead and muttered "Fool!",
472 (apparently to himself).
473 	"Everyone please stand back, I am about to get the Inn straightened up
474 and things will be a bit disorganized for a few moments." Turning to the Lazy
475 One, "Please don't dispose of the ant corpses, I need them for the cleanup." 
476 He now seemed to regard the empty (?) air near the ceiling. He spoke rapidly
477 in a strange tongue while gesturing.
478 	"Oh, Maxwell! I believe that thou hast been somewhat remiss in the
479 performance of thy duties. Thus not only renew thy former charge but I shall add
480 to it! Now thou shalt clean the Inn and also protect it. I do so charge thee! By
481 the names of Power do I bind thee. Murphy and Finagle! Speed thy children in the
482 performance of their duties."
483 	A group of strange figures had become partly visible as the apprentice spoke.
484 Thy were seated in mid-air just below the rafters. In appearance they were 
485 somewhat akin to pixies yet there was a distinct demonic cast to their features.
486 "Gremlins", muttered Whisper in a shocked voice.
487 	One of them shrugged, as if to say "can't blame a guy for trying". Then 
488 they faded from sight. There was a pause...
489 	Broken glassware and tables "fell" back into place and were whole. The 'random'
490 drifting of smoke from the fire was always towards the door. Other equally 
491 strange (but helpful!) things occured.
492 	It was about this time that someone asked the apprentice what had happened
493 to the ant corpses. "Thou dost not wish such knowledge." was the only reply.
494 ...................................
495 	There now the they're back on the job, things should be easier. They HAVE
496 to clean up the mess (and any future messes). So to compensate for all the 
497 negative entropy in the Inn, they will cause massive amounts of POSITIVE entropy
498 for any would-be attackers.

503 	"Hmmm, look at this- when we drained the last of the gas out of the
504 tank this came out." They had decided to drain the tank before adding the 
505 ethanol, so as to avoid any problems with shifting gasahol mixtures. "It looks
506 like half-dissolved sugar!" 
507 	The bard wandered over, "Well, we could waste a lot of water trying to 
508 clean it out, but I've got a better idea." He held up disk shaped object he'd
509 taken from a pocket. "This is a sort of 'filter'. It'll pass ethanol one-way and
510 anything BUT ethanol the other way. It'll just fit the fill pipe."
511 	"Yeah, but what about the sugar! It'll ruin my engine if any more gets
512 in there" complained L'homme.
513 	"Look, with this we'll have PURE ethanol in the tank. The water vapor
514 will all go out thru the filter, OK? Sugar WON'T DISSOLVE in ethanol!!"

536 AND SLEEPING. HE WALKS OUTSIDE TO GET A BREATH OF FRESH AIR AND NOTICES THE 
537 CYBORNETIC DRAGON STARING HIM IN THE FACE. THE WARRIOR TURNS IN THE OPPOSITE
538 DIRECTION WALKS FOR ABOUT 50 FEET THEN CALLS OUT "HORSE OF EVIL!!!". THEN 
539 IN A FLASH A DARK HORSE APPEARS IN FRONT OF THE WARRIOR AND GIVES THE DRAGON
540 AN EVIL LOOK THEN TELLS THE WARRIOR "YES MASTER...WHERE TO.". THE WARRIOR

548 		Little Earthquakes (words:David Bratman, music:Little Boxes)
549 	Little earthquakes on the hillside,
550 	Little earthquakes shake the ticky-tacky,
551 	And they all fall down sideways
552 	And they all look just the same.
553 There's a flat one and a smashed one
554 And a broken one and a crumpled one.
555 And they all fall down sideways
556 And they all look just the same.
557 
558 Little earthquakes hit the seismograph
559 And they make it go all ticky-tacky,
560 And the geologists shake their shaggy heads,
561 But they count them just the same.
562 	There's a big one and a little one
563 	And a great big bunch of in-betweens
564 	And they all shook up the ticky-tacky
565 	And they all work just the same.
566 
567 At the newspapers they are gleeful
568 As reports come on the ticky-tacky,
569 And they write up all the stories,
570 And they all read just the same:
571 	Little earthquakes on the hillside
572 	Have big numbers on the Richter Scale,
573 	And they all shake up the ticky-tacky
574 	And they all work just the same.
575 
576 Little filkers sing of Dorsai
577 And they play tunes on their ticky-tackys,
578 And an earthquake shakes the filk-hold
579 As the Chemist's Drink goes BOOM! (pause)
580 	There is silence in the room now
581 	As they marvel at their efficiency,
582 	And they decide they should not sing
583 	About black holes any more.

586   The piper straightended up from L'Homme's window and looked around.  They were
587 in a fairly level area, no buildings or trees were overhead, it seemed safe
588 from falling objects.  The others were crying "Earthquake!" but the piper had
589 not yet felt a tremblor.  The other causes of roars on that scale were all 
590 disasters of one sort or another ... 
591   "L'Homme!  Get moving! Now! Shift out of this reality fast!  I'll get every-
592 one else!"  As L'Homme looked into the piper's face, shocked by what he saw,
593 he rammed the car into gear and sprayed the slower members of the party wih
594 a spray of gravel.  The piper already had his pipes up by the time the car 
595 faded from view.  Leaving the drones untuned, the piper threw the zone defined
596 by the pipes as large as possible, striving to carry every living thing in 
597 as large an area as he could.  His mind, clouded by the effort, felt the small
598 movements of small furry creatures near the limits of his power, then just as
599 he felt nearly incapable of further effort, he saw a huge wall of water rising
600 over the embankment of the freeway.  Spurred by adrenaline, the piper exerted
601 an immense mental effort, and the life forms in an area over 100 yards in ;
602 diameter shimmered and dissappeared just as the curl of an immense wave crashed
603 down obliterating the former camp site.
604   The piper, already exhaused by shifting such a large area, had no idea who
605 or wahat was with him.  The mental effort of shifting realities with the 
606 mistuned pipes caused his vision to be streaked and surrounded by black.  His
607 knees felt weak and suddenly he found that he was standing on them rather than
608 on his feet.  "How curious." he thought to himself.  "What an interesting 
609 surface we are standing on.  I wonder wat it is made of?  It certainly is nice
610 that it has come so close so I can examine it."  Blackness claimed the piper
611 as he crumpled down.
