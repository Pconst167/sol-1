111    Suddenly the sail flapped noisily and unfurled.  Sorthalan walked
112 about the boat, tethering the rigging.  The vessel rocked once, then
113 spun out into the river, turned about, and went with the flow.  The
114 sail billowed and stretched, the ropes creaked and snapped, and the
115 boat listed sharply.  Sorthalan stood at the long rudder, his cloak
116 wrapped about him, his gaze fixed now on the surface and cooled our
117 skins.  The sun was low and the shadow of elementals flowed through 
118 the trees, and across the waters ahead of us, making the water ripple
119 with an eerie light.

125 Hmm, Off to a good start it would seem. I'm not sure exactly what this parrot

128 I ussually do write when I call in. It is only when I'm in a hurry or really

133 Aurthor and I prepared to leave. The lethergy around the table had grown 
134 depresing and Kurfur had yet to return from his quest.

136 "Well now, I suppose I'll let you lead. Try to avoid the areas of greater

140 "No problem, The swirls tend to upset my stomach you know." he replied.
141  
142 We began mental communication. "You know," I said looking around. "There are of
143 course two way 9th order beings."
144  
145 "Hmm, I suppose there probably are. Why do you bring it up?"
146  
147 "Well," I began. "It strikes me that these beings would have the Ability to
148 manipulate time and such."
149  
150 "Yes I suppose they could. Wouldn't be very fair of them though."
151  
152 "No, I suppose not. I would bet that it goes on you know. Maybe that explains
153 why we somtimes get the feeling that things have changed. I think I knew 
154 somebody awhile back that was a two way 9th order being. He went by the
155 name John Edison. Fancied himself to be an Interdimensional Police Officer."
156  
157 "Really? Were was he when the king took my land and lair to pay for back taxes?
158 Besides, Why do you bring all of this up?" The Dragon asked.

222 One might think that today, Friday the 13th, was just another normal day. But
223 whoever thinks that is wrong. In the movies, today would be the perfect day
224 for Friday The 13th, Part VIII to be released. Well, It wasn't. But, today,
225 completely by coincidence, the movie "Deep Star Six" was released. And, if
226 anyone knows this already, the director of that horror movie is Sean S.
227 Cunningham, who directed the original Friday The 13th. Did he do it on pur-
228 pose, or was it just coincidence. I usually don't care for horror films, but
229 there are some worth watching. I'm seeing this one tonight, and I'll write a
230 little review tomorrow (I'm not a critic -- I hate critics) to maybe help you

234 Hidey ho Hello!  Kaitlyn here.  A message to the Vision, so you go to Jesuit?
235 I happen to know a few guys who go there, in fact, I've gone out with a couple 
236 Anyway, I go to Tigard, and am a senior this year.  Maybe you can understand
237 a little about all the college application process, and how hectic it is!!!!
238 To everybody else, probably no one cares anyway, but I just got accepted to 
239 Pacific Lutheran University, with a $1500 scholarship!!!!!!!!!!!
240  
241 Since the quest seems to have disappeared without me, I think I'll get my other
242 story going.
243  
244      Years ago, in the land of Grythen, a land much like our own, a small child
245 was born to the sister of the queen.  She was destined to become the greatest h
246 the land, but since her father had died from an assasin's knife only a month be
247 and her mother died one day after her birth, the huntsman took her and hid her 
248 somewhere in the land so enemies could not find her.  She grew up, not knowing 
249 her origin, the only person who knew was that huntsman.  
250 Great beginning, Huh?

272 Backwater works on a rotation basis. There are two disks. Each has 999 lines. 
273 When one 1 is filled it gets moved to disk b. and the old disk b is archived 
274 and removed from the system. So the active drive is always drive a. if you 
275 want to get to drive be which has the last disk full of stuff you type
276 db. This will take you to disk b. To get back type da.
277  
278 I have a friend (Milchar by name when he choses to grace this place with his 
279 much to scarce presence.) Who has the complete backwater archive from 1982 to
280 mid 1987. Some fascinating stuff. (If you want a copy ask our illustriose 
281 sysop, for an adequete donation he will I have been told gladly make you 
282 copies.)
283  
284 There are around 80 360k floppies full of stuff. I havn't read all of it, But
285 from what I've browsed there is a lot of really good stuff. Some really good
286 fiction and fascinating conversation.
287  
288 Easily enough material for a book. I tend to think it would be a good idea if
289 a book of this sort were written. I can see some problems though. Who 'owns'
290 the stuff entered here? What does Cystop Mikey think? BWMS is one of the 
291 oldest BBS's in the northwest and probably one of the oldest in the country 
292 still running.
293  
294 As a aspiring historian I think BWMS would be a good subject for a book.
295 What do the rest of you think? If possible I'd like to work on it in my spare
296 time. If nothing else it gives me a good excuse to read the whole archive :-)

359 Aurthor and I appeared on the top of a low green hill overlooking a valley that
360 wa lightly forested with evergreens. There was a small creek runing down beside
361 us and it continued down into the forest to be lost in one of the denser 
362 grouping of trees.                <valley>, not <forest>
363  
364 I turned to the dragon. "As I remember your cave is located in the northeast
365 corner of the valley, I suppose you brought us down here to avoid the king and
366 his men?
367  
368 "Yes, Not that I'm afraid of them. It just seemed the prudent thing to do you
369 know." he replied.
370  
371 "Of course. Why don't I walk over there why you wait here and check things 
372 out?"
373  
374 "Sounds like a fair plan to me. Just yell if you need any help."
375  
376 "Ok, I'll be back in a hour or so."
377  
378 So saying I began the trip to the cave. It took me nearly 20 minutes to get 
379 there as the forrest had proven to be denser then I had at first thought it to
380 be.
381  
382 I approached the cave slowly so as to not encite anyone who may have been 
383 guarding it.
384  
385 I noted several men camped outside the entrance. They were dressed in suits of
386 armor and tied off to one side were approximetly two dozen large war hourses.
387  
388 "Excuse me!" I called as I walked out of the woods and onto the trail that
389 led up to the cave. "I need to speak to your leader."
390  
391 "Really? And who might you be skulking in our woods?" Asked one of the guards.
392  
393 "My name is Michael, I come representing Aurthor the Dragon lately of these
394 premasis."
395  
396 "Oh, that fat overgrown Lizard. What do you want to know?"
397  
398 "Where your leader is."
399  
400 The man sighed. "Verywell, Robbins go in and see if the revenuer is busy."
401  
402 Robbins (Or so I assumed him to be.) Got up and jogged into the cave. While I
403 was waiting I took some time to do a carfull examination of the rest of the 
404 soldiers. They were all well dressed and appeared to be Highly disciplined and
405 trained fighting men. I began to suspect that Aurthur had had good reason
406 to give in easily.
407  
408 Suddenly there was a loud pop of to my right. I turned and there I saw a 
409 familier though baffling sight. John Edison Interdimensional Police officer
410 had appeared Bathtub and all.
411  
412 "What? Hmm, I seem to be lost." He said standing up and turning around.
413  
414 "Where the bloddy Hell did you come from!" The guard who had adressed me
415 earlier asked as he and his companions drew their weapons.
416  
417 John Edison stood up straighter. "I am John Edison, Interdimensnonal Police
418 officer!" He replied proudly.
419  
420 "Police officer eh?" The guard said suspiciosly. "Well you out of your 
421 jurisdiction in that case."
422  
423 "Imposible" John Eddison replied.
424  
425 "Gentlemen." I interupted. "I think we should all relax a bit. Doesn't do to
426 have all this yelling when we could conduct ourselves as civilized beings."
427  
428 "very well" said the Guard. "We will let the king decide."
429  
430 "Is he the local authority?" asked John.
431  
432 "Yes he is." The Guard answered him.
433  
434  
435 "Very well then, I will wait to see what he says about who has authority."
436  
437 Just then the revenuer came out. "What seems to be the problem?" she said
438 walking towards the (I now assumed) Head guard.
439  
440 "Well mam, The gentlemen in the strange pants and shirt says he represents 
441 One Aurthor Dragon who used to inhabit this cave."
442  
443 "Oh, Good. He took my advice then. Come on into the cave and I'll explain 
444 the situation to you." She said motioning me forward. "Your name is?"
445  
446 "Michael."
447  
448 "And my name is Nancy. Whatch out for that Jeweled Scptre"

455 Yes, It's me, and I finally got around to seeing "Deep Star Six" today.
456 It was OK. Lots of action, but dumb action, and little good dialogue and
457 story and interesting techniques. It is definitely for the undemanding.
458 It's about some underwater science team and an alien they discover in
459 a cave under the sea floor. Sounds interesting, and is, but the final
460 production just doesn't pull through. It has some funny stuff here and
461 there, about three or four major pulse-pounding scenes, but not enough
462 considering some of the other films that have been out lately. See ya!

518 Astral Dreamer - The other adventure is dead.  Go for it, and you seem 
519 to be doing a fine job.  
520  
521 Kaitlyn - Pretty name.  Is it real or is it a pseudonym?  I picture a 
522 Kaitlyn as a smallish woman, about 5' 4", around 125#.  Delicate features,
523 but colour in the cheeks.  A long mass of wavy strawberry blonde curls.  
524 A lilting laugh out of a thin but sensuous mouth.  Red lips, and the hair
525 cascading down both sides of the face reaching down to breasts almost
526 defiant in their sauciness.  A flat stomach, well proportioned hips. 
527 Absolutely marvellous legs. 
528 Now, how close am I?  If it is a pseudonym, I can be exactly correct.  If 
529 it is real, let us know how close.
530  
531 C.C.M. - I am not sure what you are referring to by "ALL THIS STUFF FROM
532 LITERATURE" (nor do I understand why you are shouting.) but if you are
533 referring to the stories placed on the board, then I think you may be on
534 the wrong board.  BWMS has a long history of stories, dating back many
535 years.  Back when Piper, Pam, Milchar, and many others walked these
536 lines.  I would like to see us go back to some of those times.
537  
538 Cistop Mikey -
539 How about it?  There's an Idea that may have some merit.  How about 
540 resurrecting some of those times?  Put an archive disk on DB and change 
541 it every other day.  I suggest starting from the very beginning, or 
542 perhaps when Pam came back around 83.  Some of the stories and 
543 adventures were great.  Some of the debates were fabulous.  Maybe we
544 can start something anew.  Astral Dreamer has got one going, and others
545 have tried.  Maybe this would provide impetus to continue?
546 It might be hard technically, since we used to allow long lines, and 
547 there weren't as many, but I have faith in you.

558 King, Martin Luther, Jr. 
559 -------------------------------- 
560 Martin Luther King, Jr., was a man of impressive moral presence who devoted 
561 his life to the fight for full citizenship rights of the poor, disadvantaged, 
562 and racially oppressed in the United States. Born on Jan. 15, 1929, in 
563 Atlanta, Ga., he was the second of three children of the Rev. Michael (later 
564 Martin) and Mrs. Alberta Williams King. He received a bachelor's degree in 
565 sociology (1948) from Morehouse College, a B.D. (1951) from Crozer Theological 
566 Seminary, and a doctorate in philosophy (1955) from Boston University.^In 
567 1954, King accepted his first pastorate--the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in 
568 Montgomery, Ala. He and his wife, Coretta Scott King, whom he had met and 
569 married (June 1953) while at Boston University, had been resident in 
570 Montgomery less than a year when Mrs. Rosa Parks defied the ordinance 
571 concerning segregated seating on city buses (Dec. 1, 1955). King's successful 
572 organization of the year-long Montgomery bus boycott, with the assistance of 
573 the Rev. Ralph ABERNATHY and Edward Nixon, catapulted him into national 
574 prominence as a leader of the CIVIL RIGHTS movement.^King studied the life and 
575 teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and further developed the Indian leader's doctrine 
576 of satyagraha ("holding to the truth"), or nonviolent civil disobedience. In 
577 the aftermath of Montgomery he traveled, delivered speeches, and wrote his 
578 first book, Stride Toward Freedom (1958). In 1960 he accepted copastorship 
579 with his father of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and became president 
580 of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Although he continued 
581 to travel and speak widely and firmly committed the SCLC to voter-registration 
582 campaigns throughout the South, King's major campaigns were those in Albany, 
583 Ga. (December 1961-August 1962), Birmingham, Ala. (April-May 1963), and 
584 Danville, Va. (July 1963). He organized the massive March on Washington (Aug. 
585 28, 1963) where, in his brilliant "I Have a Dream" speech, he "subpoenaed the 
586 conscience of the nation before the judgment seat of morality." In January 
587 1964, Time magazine chose King Man of the Year, the first black American so 
588 honored. Later that year he became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace 
589 Prize.^After supporting desegregation efforts in Saint Augustine, Fla., in 
590 1964, King concentrated his efforts on the voter-registration drive in Selma, 
591 Ala., leading a harrowing march from Selma to Montgomery in March 1965. Soon 
592 after, a tour of the northern cities led him to assail the conditions of 
593 economic as well as social discrimination. This marked a shift in SCLC 
594 strategy, one intended to "bring the Negro into the mainstream of American 
595 life as quickly as possible." Having begun to recognize the deeper 
596 relationships of economics and poverty to racism, King now called for a 
597 "reconstruction of the entire society, a revolution of values." Along with 
598 demands for stronger civil and voting rights legislation and for a meaningful 
599 poverty budget, he spoke out against the Vietnam War. On Apr. 4, 1967, he told 
600 an audience that "The Great Society {President Lyndon Johnson's antipoverty 
601 program} has been shot down on the battlefields of Vietnam."^Early in 1968, 
602 King began to plan a multiracial poor people's march on Washington to demand 
603 an end to all forms of discrimination and the funding of a $12-billion 
604 "Economic Bill of Rights." In the midst of organizing this campaign, he flew 
605 to Memphis, Tenn., to assist striking sanitation workers. There, on Apr. 4, 
606 1968, King was felled by an assassin's bullet. The violent death of this man 
607 of peace brought an immediate reaction of rioting in black ghettos around the 
608 country. Although one man, James Earl Ray, was convicted of King's murder, the 
609 question of whether he was the paid agent of conspirators has not been 
610 conclusively resolved. It is clear only that the United States was deprived of 
611 a towering symbol of moral and social progress. King's birthday was declared a 
612 federal holiday in 1983.   DAVID LEVERING LEWIS

662 Regarding C.C.M.'s comments earlier - this is indeed the wrong board if the
663 stories and "literature" do not hold an interest for you.....
664  
665 I originally logged on this board back in about 1984 (perhaps a year or so
666 earlier - and I no longer remember my original password/name) and I was very
667 intrigued by the "round-robin" storytelling concept.  Unfortunately the only
668 time I could log on was from a display terminal at my job on graveyd so
669 I had no time to join.....just to observe.
670  
671 I now have my own system in my home office so was delighted to discover the
672 system and the original concept survives.  Perhaps the idea of "replaying"
673 some of the old archive disks would indeed be a good idea - new and old
674 users alike would benefit, I think....and the stories will go on.
675  
676 For now, I hope to observe for a short while to learn how and where the
677 new story lines are going (looks like one is off to a good start....) and
678 then I shall try my hand, if I may.  Although a bit older now, my brain and
679 imagination still work.... and I'm glad Backwater and the people on the
680 system are here.
681  
682 And now, with crystal ball in hand, I wish you all......

699 things that are facts and thus true, and religion which he says does not need
700 to have any bases in fact and can still be validly true for the religiose

703 All part of this course I accidentally took. We're trying to decide wether or

756  
757  The pain was great.  Like stuffing your whole body into a blender.  Then,
758 someone pressed the puree' button...
759  
760  ...and it continued.  Eventually, I pulled what little was left of my
761 essence out of the0wor} trap, and pieced my liquid body back into place.
762 (Concentrate: Solidify.  Rigid but moving.  Whole.  Not apart) with my
763 mind racing against the pain of re-joining.  (Almost myself, becoming
764 stronger) with each second, my body was returninw.
765  
766    Then, I heard it.
767  
768    That laugh.  Loud, but not oppressive.  Just jeering.  Somewhere.
769  
770    All was black.  Nothing.  I couldn't even find a fix on Beta Space,
771 and still, for the first time in "years", I feared.  The fear passed over
772 me, spawned from doubt and misunderstanding.  My Master Guru's words
773 came into my ear: "doubt not, for your doubt is true.  Know that
774 all is and is not and is both and neither, for you are an experience,
775 and shqll qlways be."  The doubt became a sense of calm, slowly purging
776 the more-than-human fear from my being.  I listened again, only
777 to have found that the laughter had stopped.  It was my turn to laugh.
778 Ignorance had found me and placed me ind thu worm trap (a worm trap
779 is two "wormholes" placed in opposite time flow directions.  You end
780 up travelling both forward and backward in time.  Not a fun thing).
781 Ignorance, also known as stupidity, fear, doubt, shame, guilt, and
782 ma~i mqny other names.  I chuckled, then burst out in laughter, shattering
783 the barrier of blackness around me.  I was home the entire time.
784 I was in Beta Space.  All was, as it was, again.
785  
786    "Leave my home!  Go vex some other being moru wordhy of your talents,
787 and do not return, LEAST I ENLIGHTEN YOU!" my voice boomed, and with
788 that note, Ignorance whimpered and returned to the Dark Lords, seeking
789 security.

856     SEXUAL PREFERENCE OF SHEEP SAID TO COST FARMERS MILLIONS
857  
858  DUBOIS, Idaho - About 1&0persent of the 130,000 male sheep in 
859 the nation may reject amorous overtures from females, costing 
860 sheep ranchers at least $7 million a year, the U.S. Agriculture 
861 Department said.
862  
863  Scientists at the U.S. Sheep Experiment Station0at Dubois found 
864 that 16 of the 100 rams they studied were "duds," lacking in sex 
865 drive. Similar ratios have been reported in other studies.
866  
867  "Of the 16 rams tested, half were attracted solely to other 
868 males," said biologisd James Fitzgerald.
869  
870  "Rams mounting other rams is considered normal behavior," said 
871 Anne Perkins, a doctoral candidate studying sheep behavior at the 
872 station. "However, rams that persist in mounting males, even in 
873 the presence0of vemales in heat, we call homosexuals."
874  
875  Perkins said sheep producers need to watch for nonproductive 
876 rams.
877  
878  "Our study showed homosexual behavior disrupts the matings of 
879 rams expected to service up to 100 ewes in 21 tays<" Perkins 
880 said. "This leads to fewer births, smaller flocks and less income 
881 for lamb producers."
882  
883  Perkins' study indicates that differences in high and low sex 
884 drives are linked to physiological differences. She said blod 
(85 hormone levels differ according to a ram's sex drive, adding she 
886 will continue to investigate links between a ram's hormone levels 
887 and endocrine control originating in its brain.
888  
889  "This research may have implications for thce scientists 
890 investigating human sexuality,"she said.
891  
892  The scientists hope their research will ultimately lead to the 
893 development of a simple test ranchers can use to screen 
894 nonproductive rams. The study is part of research at thu station 
895 to improve sheep production nationwide.

930 of a script I wrote for a movie that I hope to direct in the future,

936 There's an ynteresting article in today's Oregonian newspaper for those
937 who are interested in music for their computers.
938 It talks about the MIDI computer chip or something and how it can create
939 professional quality sound for home computers. Check it out!
9$0  
941 Speaking of movies, like I usually do, has anyone see the movie
942 "Electric Dreams"?? It was out in about, Oh, I guess 1983 or so, and
943 it is about a computer and how it loves the girlfried of its owner.
944 It is very funny, and rathur gull done too, with good music.
945  
946 Another good computer movie, which I am sure that most of you have
947 seen already is "WarGames", which was out in 1985 (I think). It is
948 a great movie, although maybe a bit exaggerated.
949 I mean, the0leating computer whiz is a little bit too smart and
950 the school's password for their modem is not hidden very well, etc.
951 but I guess something like the incidents in that movie could really
952 happen, but I'm not sure. What do you people think??/ D you think
953 that that could really happen?? I mean could a kid of 16-17 years of
954 age get into the state's national defense system and make it seem
955 as though it was World War III?????
956  
957 Astral D, in response to your remarks about youb class you take at
958 PSU (I think), I take it that you really do not like what you are
959 studying. What you said you had to do a report on sounded really
960 useless to what you want to go into (a computer related field), and
961 you must be i~ qeyte a bit of struggle with that class. I hope you
962 solve that soon.
963  
964 Has anyone here ever played any of those 3D animated adventure games.
965 They are so killer!! Like King's Quest, II, III, and IV, and Space
966 Quest, II, and III (con to be released) and a few others. They are some
967 of the best graphics I have ever seen for home computers these days.
968 And with one of those special music feature cards like I mentioned
969 earlier, they supposedly are in stereo with up to 8 tiffubent sounds
970 playing at once. They actually have professional composers who worked
971 on the music for King's Quest IV!! Can you believe it?? Computer games
972 have really come a long way.
973 By the way, if anyone here needs hints on any of those 3D games, I have
974 solved just about all of them that are out. Just say what you need to
975 know!!

983 I believe Vision asked0me qwhile ago what sorts of movies I like. I liked ET, 
984 the first half was all comercials,(coke, Pizza, reces pieces etc.). The second
985 half was really enjoyable. There was a movie called Darkstar made a number of
986 20 or so years ago that I real|i enjoyed. Dark but brilliant I believe it was 
987 written and directed by the same guy who did alien, aliens and lifeforce.
988 I really don't watch many movies. Bukeroo Bonzai was really great to.
