 24 Ah, Looks like I'm at the top. Story entry part II coming up.

 26      He walked down the stairs on the far side of the central patio and
 27 into the yard proper. He looked over at the waterfall with it's
 28 surronding glen and saw one of the pixies motioning to him. It was a side 
 29 trip, but one he gladly made. 
 30  
 31      "Hello Angi." He said recognizing the pixie.
 32  
 33      "Hello Patrick of the humens. I see you have been given the gift."
 34  
 35      "Gift?"
 36  
 37      "Yes, the gift of the tree. You are coming of age."
 38  
 39      "Everybody seems so wierd today."
 40  
 41      "Ah, that is the first sign!" She said playfully.
 42  
 43      Patrick laughed nervosly. "I suppose next you'll be telling me that
 44 I'm going on a long trip."
 45  
 46      "Why tell you what you already know? There is a gift we would give you
 47 as well."
 48  
 49      "It's not my birthday for another week yet."
 50  
 51      "This gift will not wait I think. will you please follow me?"
 52  
 53      "I suppose." He said resignedly.
 54  
 55      They approached the Waterfall and as they did passed many of the other
 56 pixies of the fall. All of them looked at him stragly, waving with half 
 57 smiles on their faces.
 58  
 59      At the foot of the fall was a small pile of silver cloth. Angi hovered 
 60 above it and to the left. "This is our gift,will you wear it?"
 61  
 62      Patrick bent down and picked up the cloth. It was a silvery robe that
 63 felt firm to the touch, though it was nearly feather light. Patrick put
 64 it on awkwerdly. "I look like a wizard." He mused.
 65  
 66      "That is the first step. Now you must continue the journey you have 
 67 already begun."
 68  
 69      He noded uncertainly and walked thoughtfully from the area of the fall.
 70  
 71      ahead was the dog house. As he got closer the lines began to blur and
 72 he again heard the strange music that was the signature of this place.
 73  
 74      He cirled the building noting that it was at a crossroads. To one side
 75 was a large silvery lake and in the front by the welcoming door was a 
 76 large tree that reminded him of the treant. 
 77  
 78      Seeing nothing else to do he walked up to the door and knocked lightly.
 79  
 80      He waited a moment longer, and then knocked again more loudly. The door 
 81 opened and the music grew louder. In the doorway stood a women dressed in
 82 the clothing of a medieval waitress. "What are you doing just standing
 83 there laddy? No need to knock, come in and be welcome!" she said motioning
 84 him inside.
 85  
 86      He went in feeling dazed by the rapid changes that were going
 87 on around him.

 96         Merryl jumped to the side, shoving me down upon the bricks to the
 97 side.  A man inside the transparent top of the demon shook his fist at us
 98 and screamed silent obsenities at us.  He passed.  All became quiet.
 99         I was thankful for my breath- that had been much too close!  I
100 managed to mutter a breathless "Thank You" to Merryl, who lay panting
101 nearby.
102         "Hey dudes."  A dark figure detached from the shadows and moved
103 nearer.  His shiny black clothing dully reflected the light cast by a
104 magickal globe suspended by a pole.  "That sweeper guy nearly ran you over.
105 Sue the city, man, I'll be your witness."  He glanced again at our clothes,
106 noticably different from his own.  "SCA-ers?"
107         "I beg your pardon," began Merryl, "we don't understand a word
108 you've said."
109         "For that matter," said I, "we don't know where we are.  This
110 doesn't look like Dunbarrah."
111         "Some heavy medication you SCA-ers are into.  Don't you remember
112 checking into the City of Roses?"
113         Merryl tried to explain.  "I am afraid not.  We're not sure how we
114 got here.  One moment we were in our dormitory-"
115         "I get it!  College dudes!  PSU, right?"
116         "Is he speaking the same language, Pan?" whispered Merryl.
117         "I haven't decided yet," I replied.
118         "...go back to campus this time of night would be kinda dumb,"
119 continued the stranger.  "You guys wanna go with me to the studio?  You
120 like modern music?  Me and the gang are practicing later."
121         I noted a group of large men, attired in a way similar to our
122 newly aquired friend save for the number of metal protrusions sprouting
123 from various points upon their clothing, walking closer.  They seemed to
124 be highly interested in us.
125         Our friend looked around, spotted them.  "Er, can we talk someplace
126 else?  Seems we got company."
127         The men had broken into a run, directly for us.
128         "Number Seven!" someone yelled.

154 Ah things are really looking good! Welcome back all and may you grace us
155 with your presences more often!
156  
157 Ok, Now for part three of my story.
158  
159      The inside of the Inn was warm and bright and there were many people
160 seated around it's tables and on it's bar stools. Far more then one would
161 expect to be in such a remote place.
162  
163      "Well now, Can I be getting you somthing?" The barmaid asked him.
164  
165      "Ah, no thank you. I'm really not very hungry." He answered uncomfortably.
166  
167      "Thats fine, Why don't you have a seat then and relax. You don't look 
168 well lad."
169  
170      Patrick noded. He looked around noting the strage costumes that most
171 of the patrons wore. "No stranger then mine though I suppose" He thought
172 trying to find a place to sit.
173  
174      He noted a man who was dressed quite strangly for this place. He wore
175 Faded blue jeans a green t-shirt and a strange green comofloge colored hat.
176 Patrick walked over to his table. "Uhmm, Pardon me. Do you mind if I sit 
177 down?"
178  
179      The man looked at him curiosly for a moment. "No, please do. I was 
180 getting rather bored. I'm always anxiose for conversation. Despite your
181 clothing I believe you are from a place called earth. Is that not correct?"
182  
183      "Yes," Patrick said sitting down in a vacant chair. 
184  
185      "I had thought so. People call me the wanderer. And your name is?"
186  
187      "Patrick."
188  
189      "Well, hello Patrick and welcome to the Inn at the crossroads. Would
190 you mind telling me how you came to be here?"
191  
192      "It may sound rather silly, but actually all of this is in my back
193 yard. This building used to belong to my dog Cymry before he dissapered."
194  
195      The wanderer laughed. "Ah, the Inn manifests itself in many forms over
196 many dimensions, But this is indeed a new one to me." He grew more seriose.
197 "Those are rather strange clothes you wear, and that staff hardly seems to be 
198 of earthly origin."
199  
200       "Staff? Oh you mean this stick? The Treant that lives in my yard
201 gave it to me. The Pixies by the fall gave me the robe. Both said I was
202 going on a long journey."
203  
204       "It is a very interesting back yard you have."
205  
206       "I suppose so. I never really thought about it." He again looked 
207 around the large room. "What is this place?"
208  
209       "Why it's the Inn at the crossroads. A place for people to gather 
210 and talk and relax and tell tales. The means of getting here are as varied
211 as the faces."
212  
213       "Oh."
214  
215       "All a bit bewildering I know. It will come clear in time."
216  
217       "Yeah, I guess it will. I need t do some thinking, Do you mind
218 if I sit here and just be quite?"
219  
220       "No, go ahead. It's what I do my self most of the time."

226    HI!!!!  It's good to see familiar names again
227    Kathyd, milchar, and others.....  I realy do miss reading the good things
228   you all write.
229  
230 ->
231   I had been hiking for most of the day.
232   It had started as just a desire to see what was on the other side of that 
233  large, forested hill out behind the house, but when I got to the top I just
234  had to see what was beyond the forest, and then what was on the other side of 
235  the river, and well wanderlust just took over.
236   As the sun began its slow descent toward the hills I chanced upon a road.
237   And, being of the gambling nature, I flipped a coin and followed that 
238  direction down the road.
239   This road seemed to wind on for ever.  The forest it was passing in and out o
240 of didn't look like the one on the maps and the house.  For that matter, the 
241 sound of running water from the river should still be audible, but as I 
242 listened, all I could here was a bird in the distance and the wind among the 
243 trees.
244   With the shadows lengthening I was eager to find some place to rest for the 
245 night.  Asuming that a road ment people I kept following it.  And as the sun 
246 touched the horizon I saw ahead of me a large building beside a lake.  I 
247 hurried toward the door, and, as I approached I could here the sound of music
248 lingering in the air.

252 Getting in the rest of the way was a snap. I was now standing in front of
253 a large steel wall with a vault door.
254  
255 It was time to bring ender my code generator back on line. "Fore ground!" I 
256 said out loud. It appeared in my hand in the shape of a laser pistol.
257  
258 I held ender up and pulled the trigger, cutting chunks out of the door with
259 a motion of my arm.
260  
261 "Move a bit to the right, Getting close to sensor." I Ender said as I moved
262 his beam to the left to far.
263  
264 "Ok, looks like we're about in."
265  
266 "Kit, Yes we almost there"
267  
268 With a final blast the door opened out on it's hinges. I did a fast download
269 of everything inside. Almost over ran my buffers there was so much of it.
270  
271 The blast from behind nearly knocked me out. I feel to the floor in like
272 a limp rag doll. From the corner of my eye I saw the unmistakable persona
273 of a cp.
274  
275 "I've got you now you worthless piece of sh*t!" He said grinning evily at me
276 as he walked closer with the blaster raised.
277  
278 "I don't think so bozo." I said through clenched teath. "Suprise!" I added
279 as I started a very special little sub proccess I always keep in the
280 background. The explosion was hot and deadly, but I wasn't there. Instead
281 I lay gasping on the floor of the Inn. I eased myself up slowly. The pain
282 was real enough.
283  
284 "No need to worry folks, just been on a little errand." I said making the
285 final effort to get to my feet and make it to an empty table.
286  
287 I sat gasping for a moment. "Barkeep, bring me a glass of your best!" I 
288 managed after resting.

300 A short story; this story involves our personal involvement with a man
301 who has a drinking problem.  This man although not yet living on 
302 "Burnside" is just one step away from a cot at Baloney Joes.  And if
303 I seem angry, it's because this man is so intelligent, has so much
304 to offer and has chosen to turn to the bottle.  In a way this is a social
305 commentary on alchoholics, who during drinking periods lack respect for
306 themselves and others.  This experience has really made me believe that
307 no matter how much you try to help people like this, they just use
308 you and never change.
309  
310                       The summer of IT!
311  
312 It was a beautiful day in early July when IT! came to stay.  A friend
313 during days gone by; down on IT's luck.  "Nothing was going right," and
314 IT had run out of homes.  My brain screamed "NO!" but my heart warmed
315 to IT's dilemma and made an offer:  "Although it's not much, you
316 are most than welcome to park your gear in our humble garage."  The
317 house was already packed with the three of us & our insulated/heated
318 garage was a place for IT to start.  IT agreed and moved it.
319  
320 Trouble started that night when the roommate came home, she wasn't
321 pleased but seemed to understand our motivation to help.  Many bad things
322 started to happen as the resources of our home were invaded by IT.  It
323 never contributed, IT only took.  After a house meeting, we decided 
324 that IT should help us out a little for the hospitality we were extend-
325 ing, so IT under much protest assisted with our house painting project.
326 (underway before IT arrived.) The job to this day has never been quite
327 completed.
328  
329 IT would typically, (according to our roommate) hang around the house
330 all day and then shower and leave before we get home from work.  IT 
331 would make promises of work to be done, or food IT was going to buy
332 (replacement items) or whatever seemed convenient.  IT never followed
333 through.
334  
335 Must have been 1:00 a.m. sometime in August of 88 when IT was driving
336 along I/5 north.  IT had a five gallon drum of white "At Last America"
337 paint "It's not paint, it's At Last America!" on the floor in front
338 on the passenger side.  When IT took the exit to 217 North, the lid
339 on the paint drum popped off, the drum tipped to the left and "shoveled"
340 most of the contents into the driver side footwell.  IT was up to IT's
341 calves in paint.  This in itself was not bad for us, but the quarter
342 sized hole in the floorboard was.  I haven't checked recently, but
343 about a month ago (Jan/Feb) you could still follow the new and erratic
344 white line from the intersection of I-5/217 to our home.  At our 
345 driveway, the white line becomes a large white spill and then white
346 footprints.  These footprints lead up the driveway and onto our cedar
347 decks up to the front door.  If you look closely; you can see two 
348 little white marks on the threshold where IT's white toes were resting.
349 Our roommate didn't let IT in the house, so the white foot prints go
350 back across the deck and down the driveway again.  
351  
352 There is more to the story, but I believe that you have the basic 
353 concept of it.
354  
355 Mostly, I couldn't understand the total lack of respect of our home/
356 property.  We still don't know what the dollar figures are going to
357 run to refinish our decks and driveway.
358  
359 The last straw came a month later, my husband found some of our wedding
360 stainless in the garage.  These spoons were badly scorched and ruined by
361 IT cooking drugs in them with a torch.  So not only did IT again damage
362 our property, IT also could have burned down our home.  IT was told to
363 leave.  
364  
365 So, here we are, the events of the summer had a major impact on 
366 relationships with roommates.  Our good roommate moved out at the end
367 of September, we miss her, but really are enjoying the privacey.  We
368 don't have the extra funds to fix the things that were damaged last
369 summer and it will be a while before all wrongs are righted.
370  
371 The moral to this story:  Don't help anyone who you know to have a
372 drinking/drugs problem unless your willing to get badly hurt in the
373 process.  Don't expect miracles, expect to get screwed.

387 An interesting story kathyD. It seems to me that you expected somthing from 
388 IT that was not forthcoming. 
389  
390 It is good and noble to wan't to help others, But in my experience you can 
391 seldom be a 'savior'. The trick is to not let them into an enviorment 
392 that allows them to continue in the pattern they have grown accustomed to.
393  
394 It may sound harsh, But somtimes you just have to let people bottom out. It 
395 will either kill or cure them. Let them no that you care, but are not
396 going to be used. 
397  
398 Well, on to part four. Vision, my main problem with my last entry was at
399 it was not as clear and concise as it could have been.
400      Patrick sat for nearly an hour contemplating the things He had
401 been experiencing. He would have sat there longer if it were not
402 for a commotion at the door.
403  
404      "I say, What is this?" Said a balding man from the entrance 
405 as a large furry form streaked through the now open door through the crowd 
406 and towards the table at which Patrick and the Wanderer sat.
407  
408      "Cymry?" Patrick said as the form (Now revealed to be a large German
409 shepherd.) came to a skiding halt before them.
410  
411      The Dog wagged its tail and looked at him with anticipation. "Why it is
412 you!" He said rising from his seat and hugging his old friend.
413  
414      Growing self conciose he stood and looked around. The other people in the
415 Inn had went back to their business. "Do they allow dogs in here?" He asked 
416 the Wanderer.
417  
418      "I don't see why not. Just be sure he doesn't leave any messes 
419 around and I'm sure knobody will mind."
420  
421      "I wonder were he came from?"
422  
423      "You said the Inn was his Dog house did you not?"
424  
425      "Yes..."
426  
427      "Well it would appear that he made the trip 
428 as well."
429  
430      "But he's been gone for almost a year."
431  
432      "Don't let it bother you, time is a strange thing."
433  
434      Patrick sat back down slowly stroking Cymry's back. He was soon deep in
435 thought again.
436  
437      "You know, My parents dissapeared too. I wonder if they're around here
438 somewere?" Without realizing it he took his mini-pack off and
439 opened it, pulling out the small green Orb he had placed there earlier.
440  
441      It was warm and glowed faintly. "Thats strange." he said slowly rotating
442 it in the palm of his hand.
443  
444      The wanderer lost the far away look in his eyes and stared at the Orb.
445 "I didn't know you were a wizard, though you look it I suppose."
446  
447      "I'm not. People keep telling me I am or that I will be or something like 
448 that."
449  
450      "Maybe they're right."
451  
452      Patrick looked at the staff that was now sitting in his lap. It to had
453 a faint glow.
454  
455      "You said that a Treant gave you that staff?"
456  
457      "Yes, is that strange?"
458  
459      "Depends on where your from." The Wanderer replied mysteriosly.

466 And so it goes I guess.
467  
468 After a time the pain had lessened enough for me to reach out and drink the
469 ale that the barkeep had brought me.
470  
471 "How are you Kit?" 
472  
473 I looked around, winced and smiled at Lisa. "I've been better, Give me 
474 another ten minutes or so and I'll be fine."
475  
476 She smiled "Why is it that whenever I see you you look as if you've just
477 been through some sort of beating?"
478  
479 "Just the downside of being a working man."
480  
481 "Maybe, or the results of being out of your depth." She said sitting down in
482 the chair opposite him.
483  
484 Kit looked back moodily. "I hope you didn't come here for a fight, I'm really
485 not feeling up to it."
486  
487 "No, just examining the possibilities. You know you really don't need to go
488 back to that hell you call home. You could stay here."
489  
490 "And do what? Stare at the walls untill my brain explodes? No thanks. Don't 
491 get me wrong, I reallly enjoy this place. Just don't wan't to be stuck here
492 forever."
493  
494 "I suppose, You know it hasn't bothered me that much and I've been here..."
495  
496 "Three years this coming Augest. And you can't even remember the date."
497  
498 "Look Kit, If you must know I was about to give you the exact amount of time
499 down to the nearest second. Your so damned annoying at times." She said
500 idly brushing her hair from in front of her face.
501  
502 Kit sighed. "Look Lisa I'm sorry. I guess nearly being killed puts me in 
503 a bad mood." He paused long enough to call for another drink. "Keeps life
504 interesting though."
505  
506 "It's ok I suppose. Your the only line I have to news back home, I guess
507 I'll just have to put up with you."
508  
509 "Speaking of back home, I aught to check up on that stuff I got from the

515 ruined?  Well, I was dead wrong.  It seems that the resulting power surge
516 fried the delicate inter modem bits, and they died shortly (3 calls) after.
517 	Now, with a totally new modem, I hope that I will be back for quite
518 some time.  The warranty people assured me that what happened was a 1 in a
519 million occurrence, but I don't think I can trust them very far (I had to
520 convince them that the damage was not my fault to get a replacement). In
521 any case, I am finally back, and I hope he withdrawal symptoms will

536         I put my hand over the stranger's eyes and closed mine.  A bright
537 white blaze brighter than sunlight illuminated the street, blinding our
538 attackers.  As our assailants cursed and felt their way forward we took
539 the opprotunity to depart.  Merryl smiled and put his Hahr-mon-ika away.
540         The "studio" proved to be no more than a few street crossings
541 away.  Our guide smiled at us and said, "Gotta hand it to you dudes, you
542 sure know how to handle yourselves."  To the windows above he yelled,
543 "Comin' in- got some friends!" as we climbed the staircase.
544         We were greeted by the musicians, but they resembled no bards I
545 ever heard of.  Shiny black clothing and partially shaven heads seemed
546 to be the norm...
547         "I'd like you to meet the gang- Syd, Tony, Tom, and I'm John.
548 Apart we're just regular guys.  Together we're Johnny Noize and the Ruckus."
549         "I'm Pan, and he's Merryl.  Together, we're just lost."
550         "Don't you know the way back to the campus?" asked Johnny.
551         "We're not from Peaesyoo.  We attend the School of Magick in
552 Dunbarrah, Plesia."
553         "Any you guys heard of Plez-ya?" asked Johnny.
554         "Isn't that near Old Town?" asked Syd.
555         "Aren't they with Motown?" inquired Tony.
556         "I use that in my hair all the time.  Works great." put in Tom.
557  
558         Never heard of Plesia?  Where in the Thousand Hells were we?
559  
560         "Those are interesting-looking instruments over there."  Merryl
561 pointed to a haphazard arrangement of equipment, loosely bound by thin
562 wires that wandered snakelike on the floor.
563         "We we about to practice.  Hey, you guys know any instruments?"
564         I showed him my flute, Merryl showed him his Hahr-mon-ika.
565         Johnny laughed.  "Can't really jam with those.  Know how to use
566 a keyboard?"
567         "No," I said, "but I'm willing to try.  Looks like a small piano."
568         He grinned.  "Helluva lot better than that.  Try it."
569         I moved closer to the thing.  The bottom greatly resembled the
570 piano, a little-known instrument from another world.  I had practiced with
571 one on and off during the Thirty Days, already looking for my choice of
572 instrument.  I pressed a few keys.
573         Such complexity of sound!  A press upon the key brought forth
574 rich melody.  I played with it for a bit, getting the feel it.  I tried
575 a few smaller keys, experimentally.  It didn't help that I didn't know
576 the language in which the keys were labeled.  Johnny helped me while
577 Merryl joined the Ruckus in imbibing a dark fluid dispensed in cans.  I
578 tried one.  Too bitter.  Merryl seemed to enjoy it, though.
579         I found I could play the keyboard quite well.  I had always
580 had a talent for picking up a new instrument; it had served me well in
581 my days as a minstrel.  "Care to see a little show, Johnny?"
582         He nodded, drunkenly; I realized the fluid was alcoholic.  I
583 hoped Merryl would keep his wits about him.
584         I had something specific in mind- Spell three.
585         I sung them a dreamsong.

595  
596    My mind is blank.  Inspiration seems to have left with the
597 passing of the wind, fluttering in the distence.  I could always upload
598 my incomplete story, "The Valley".  It was based on a vivid dream I had
599 several years ago, while listening to a tape.  But the story is never
600 finished.  Maybe it shouldn't be - after all, there is no
601 end to immortality.
602  
603    I might return later and do a complete copy.  Please be patient with
604 the erratic style of the story, I was only 16 when I wrote it.
605  
606    But on to other things: abstaining from entries.  I think that
607 the "Lurk Approach" is a minimal stop-gap, when there is play
608 to be done.  Even if you are at a complete blank, you could always
609 leave an opinion here, or whip up a quickie to test your impromptu
610 writing style.  Remember, you don't live forever, but there's always
611 tomarrow.  Do not feel pressured by me or any other - take things at
612 your own pace.
613  
614   My appologies for my absence, but as the regulars know, this happens
615 off and on.  It shames me to loose contact with the "family" I have,
616 for I enjoy the company and tales of everyone here.  It saddens my
617 heart when I can't communicate, or even read, with others here.  In
618 a sense, it is a part of my social life, but in a limited way.
619  
620    Finally, my applause to Astral Dreamer for his fine work.  Your
621 story is well-rounded and, basically, "GOOD TO READ!"  I await for
622 your next chapter.
623  
624    Muse, are you out there?  Kurfur, is your modem going to go
625 critical mass, or will you be here once again?  Lord Beaker,

649 Kit sighed, "Do you want an interface as well?"

651 "Do you see a plug anywere on my head?" Lisa replied pulling her long black
652 hair up to expose her neck.

695 Hello All, Here's part 5. 
696    
697   "So you say you are not a Wizard and yet you have all the gear. It 
698 seems to me that what you need is somebody to train you."
699  
700      "Me a Wizard? I suppose it would be rather fun..."
701  
702      "Patrick, magic is a very seriose and dangerouse thing."
703  
704      Patrick sighed. "Seems that everything that looks or sounds fun has
705 a down side."
706  
707      "The only thing you are guarenteed to get for free is life. Everthing afte
708 that is up to you."
709  
710      "I suppose. Were you offering to train me?"
711  
712      "Me? No, I'm afraid that I don't really know that much about the brand
713 of magic that you seem to have. I do know somebody though who might be
714 willing to take on an apprentice."
715  
716      "I'm not sure I have the time. I need to be back by tonight or my 
717 Grandmother will start to worry about me. And I have a math test on monday
718 that I can't afford to miss."
719  
720     "Doesn't hurt to check in to this sort of thing does it?"
721  
722     "Well, ok. Just so long as I'm back in time for dinner." 
723  
724      "I'll do my best."
725  
726      The Wanderer stood and moving away from the table motioned Patrick to 
727 follow. They walked through the Inn and out the front door with Cymry
728 following.
729  
730      In front of the Inn they paused and looked at the sky. It was now
731 noon and Patrick could feel the sweet begining to form on the back of his
732 neck.
733  
734      "I guess I'm a bit overdressed, It's still winter back home."
735  
736      "It's always spring here. Why don't you take off your coat, you won't
737 need it anytime soon."
738  
739      "I don't think it would fit in my pack and I really don't want to 
740 carry it around with me."
741  
742      "Hmm, Mind if I take a look at that pack?"
743  
744      "I suppose not." Patrick said unshouldering it and handing it to him.
745  
746      The Wanderer opened it and looked inside. Closing his eyes he put his
747 right hand in. Then he put his lower arm followed. And then his 
748 upper arm. He seemed to make waving motions and then pulled his arm out.
749 "There you are, I think it will fit now." He said with a wink.
750  
751      Patrick took it back and looking inside noteing that his small backpack
752 now seemed to have the insides of a large ruck sack. "Yes, I suppose it 
753 will." He said turning a little green.
754  
755      "Are you all right?"
756  
757      "Yes, It's just that this sort of thing is supposed to be impossible."
758  
759      "My young friend, I think you'll discover soon that there is very little
760 that is really impossible."

779         Sages have known for centuries that sweet music can bring images
780 of breathtaking clarity to the mind; the Dreamsong was based on that.
781 The basic melody was always the same, but the variations controlled what
782 the audience saw.  I sung of Dunbarrah.
783         As I felt the SNAP of Power, a misty vision formed before us.
784 It became clearer as I played- a scene of the School of Magick.  Several
785 bright flashes of colored light hinted at the spells being cast and
786 miscast within.  Just as I last saw it.
787         A new melody suggested itself to me, and I slid into it smoothly.
788 The School gained new clarity, the illusion taking up the entire far wall.
789 A cool breeze washed over us.
790         "Awright!" yelled Johnny.  "Looks like a party- let's go!"  He
791 walked forward, the Ruckus following him.
792         They vanished into the wall.
793         My mouth fell open, my hands faltered.  The scene was gone.
794         Merryl and I were alone.
795         Suddenly, Merryl was cold sober.  "That-that was an illusion spell,
796 I heard you play it.  Where are they now, Pan?"
797         My stomach sank.  "Dunbarrah, I think."  I looked at the keyboard.
798 "This thing lets me evoke a lot of Power.  I really was shooting for a
799 Simple Illusion."
800         "Can you do it again?  The Ruckus doesn't belong in Plesia."
801         "I-I'll try."  I tried to remember the notes, played a few.
802

806 better'n yours, though.  Hum.  Maybe you should try a sending."
807         I stared at him.  "You've been drinking too much of that brown
808 stuff.  Do you remember what happens if that spell goes out of control?"
809         "Yeah, the backlash is nasty- but can you think of a better idea?"
810         He had me there.

829 Another Returnee, welcome back. Talos, The last part of your story had to do
830 with the guy on the beach leaving after showing the high ranking military 
831 types what he had found in the surf. I believe that he told them that thui
8#2 would be contacting the people he worked for and having him assigned to
833 them.
834

857 sorry for such a0gabrled entrance - how embarassing. kathyD's struck me the
858 most. the lesson i have learned from similar experience(s): you cannot 
859 help/change other people. only they can truly help/change themselves. you
860 can only help/change yourself. sometimes the hardest thing to do  is let people
861 live their own lives. you cannot fix 'it' for them (whatever 'it' is) and even
862 if you could, they would resent it in the end.
863  
864 i've really enjoyed reading this board - took me quite a while0do figure out
865 what was what but now i'm glad i did. i'm not very good at impromptu writing
866 and previous attempts to upload on another system were 1) unsuccessful and 2)

877 Hello, And welcome Alyx. 
878  
879 Side note: The Inn is in a middlu sized valley. There is a stream a short 
880 distance away from the back that runs into the silvery lake. leading downt
881  to the stream is a footpath and over it is a small bridge.
882  
883 Also the Inn is made of wood, two stories high. The mai~ lobby is were 
884 everybody hangs out, and were the front door opens onto. There is of course a
885 bar and a stairway leading up to rooms on the second floor. Also on the
886 first floor is a door that leads into the kitchen area. Oh can't forget thu
88' fire place.
888  
889 The above comes from Milch,(Correct me if I screwed up anything oh wise and
890 powerfull one! :-) ).
891  
892 Ok, next part of the story coming up.
893  
894       Patrick removed his robe and took off the coat. He placud it carefully
895 within his pack. "It's strange you know, I never felt warm in the Inn."
896  
897       "Strange? Not really, It's the nature of the place. It always feels just
898 right inside."
899  
900       "Oh, I see."
901  
902       "Abu you ready to start?"
903  
904       Patrick finished putting his robe back on and shouldered the pack. "Yes."
905 He paused for a moment "You know my pack feels lighter now then it did 
906 before I put the coat inside."
907  
908       "Yes, the0moru you put into  it the lighter becomes. The reverse is also
909 true. Shall we be on our way?"
910  
911        "I guess."
912  
913        "Excellent!" The Wanderer said striding towards the lake.
914  
915       They walked less then 100 yards0befobe they came to it's edge. Patrick 
916 could see now that the silvery sheen was real and not just an illusion of
917 the light. "Here, take my hand. And grab Cymry's coller." The Wanderer said.
918  
919       Patrick grasped Cymry firmly and then0reashed out and grasped 
920 the Wanderers hand as well. They walked up to the shore and into the lake.
921  
922       "Wanderer, were are we going?"
923  
924       "Don't be afraid, We're going through a portal." he replied.
925  
926       Patbyck took several deep breaths, held one gave Cymry a reasuring pet 
927 and plunged forward after the Wanderer. Strangly they did not float and after

929  moment Patrick0bealized he was breathing. They continued their journey for 
930 several minutes.
931  
932 Patrick glanced at his left arm and looked at the watch on his wrist. The
933 display was frozen.
934  
935       All around them was the dull shimering glow0dhat had suffused the 
936 surfuce of the lake. Slowly the light ahead began to change and brighten.
937 The Wanderer dissapeared from sight for a moment and then Patrick broke
938 the surface coming into an ally.
939  
940       He turned and watched0in qmazment as Cymry and his arm emerged from 
941 a brick wall.
942  
943       "Remember this spot, I'll mark it." The Wanderer said letting go of his 
944 hand and pulling out what looked to be a piece of chalk. He marked a large X 
945 on the wal| thuy had just come through. "Cymry, You'll remember it just in 
946 case Patrick gets lost won't you boy?"
947  
948       The dog wagged his tail and nodded.
949  
950       The wall they had emerged out of was in fact the far wall of an enclosed
)51 alley. There was only one way to go from here. trash and dirt were strewn
952 everywere.
953  
954       "Not a very nice looking place, are you sure this is were we want to be?
955  
956       "Why of course, We're almost there."
957  
958    0  They walked out of the dirty ally and onto a dirty street. 
959 There seemed to be more dirt here then in many places that were considered to 
960 be wilderness.
961  
962        "Welcome to gloriose Agate Bay. If we want to avoid the slums we'll
9&3 be0going this way." The Wanderer said striking out to the left.
964  
965        "AVOID? looks like we're right in the middle of them!" Patrick replied.
