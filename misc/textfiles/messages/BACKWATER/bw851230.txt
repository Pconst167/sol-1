20 The PorSFiS crowd never said that Elephant & Castle was too far.
21 The Cheerful Tortoise is too far (remember, many of these people will have
22 to walk *back* to the cars parked near the Library...).
23 Also PorSFiS is looking for a new meeting place, so there is no point 
24 picking a new 'permanent' libation site until we know where we will be
25 starting from!

29 THE TOP OF WATT,LENNERD?
30 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\32
31    Nexus. The city that covered a world. A hundred thousand warpgates, of the same type that James used but
32 artificially maintained and permanently open, extended to a hundred thousand world in the galaxy and beyond. Nexus was
33 exactly what its name implied, a crossroads for all the worlds it served. An uncoutable number of cultures clashed
34 here, magical, technological, and both. A unified government or police force was impossible, making Nexus a very
35 dangerous place to travel alone in.
36    James stepped out of the hospital entrance, more alone than he looked. He had asked around and found that Tariya
37 had also left alone, and for points unknown. He had no way to find her and hoped she would be all right.
38    He hailed a groundcab and took it to a high-rise apartment building not far from the hospital. When he got there he
39 took the elevator to the top floor. It was a long ride, 492 stories straight up. When it reached the top he took out a
40 key and inserted it into a plate by the buttons. The elevator rose another floor. The doors opened and he stepped out
41 into a huge, luxuriously furnished penthouse. It was his, all bought and paid for. He collapsed exhaustedly into a
42 chair. After who knows how many days stuck in that damn bed he was very easily exhausted. His powers were still run
43 down so far that he couldn't use them to save his life.
44    When he first came to this city, two years ago, he was on his last doller, or intercred, if you prefer. He needed
45 money, and quickly. An idea had struck him. He already had quite a reputaion, and a lot of rumors about his exploits
46 had been flying around. Why not make use of the skills he had been born with and try to sell his story? He had
47 approached the biggest publisher he could find with his proposal. To his amazement, they immediately offered him an
48 eight figure advance on the story. With part of that money, he bought this penthouse and settled himself in to write
49 the story. Six weeks later, he had a manuscript. It was published in record time and became an instant galatic
50 bestseller. Soon everybody knew of the Destroyer and at a 10% commision per sale, he soon had literally more money
51 that he knew what to do with. It was still adding up, even two years later.
52    He'd wanted to show off this beautiful apartment. He'd wanted to take her out and show her the city like Putzie
53 never could. It was all a pipe dream now. She wouldn't be back. He knew it in his heart. He'd left his address with
54 Doc Kanden just in case she came looking but he knew how futile that was. She would probably stay with Putzie, who
55 would use her and then throw her out. He had done it before. James knew him, she didn't.
56    Putzie's apartment was in this building, 361 floors below him. Maybe he should go down there. But what would he
57 say? She was pissed, and quite rightly so. He had remembered that stupid gun long before they reached the Palace. He
58 also knew it was the reason Tariya's spell had gone awry. Why hadn't he gotten rid of it? Afterwards, his stupid
59 stinking ego wouldn't let him admit what he had done, which he carried to irrational extremes. And it cost him Tariya.
60 He deserved to be alone. Time and again he had proven himself unfit for human company, even when he wanted or needed
61 it. And so he was alone. Again.
62    Five thousand feet above the city, the only noise in the huge penthouse was the sound of soft crying.

65 	Gasping at fresh air, there must be some about!  I feel as if I am
66 about to choke from the fumes that have enveloped myself and my friends.
67 Just a moment, it's to the left...  No, to the right.  I thought I felt it
68 over to the right.  Yes, there it is!  At long last, I have come to find my
69 spectacles!  Maybe now I can discover some path away from these clouds.
70 	Placing the lenses before my eyes I discover that they have not
71 been sitting idle while I was distracted.  Why am I not able to see?  Hmmm.
72 Where did all these scratches generate?  This will not do, this just will
73 not do.  Someone has gone as far as to have broken them between the lenses!
74 This is a fine pickle I've gotten myself into.  Broken!  How will I see?
75 	Wait, these vapors do seem to be parting.  It's a good thing I'm
76 still able to see the lights ahead of me; they certainly are bright.
77 	As if the fact that I now had to contend with these conditions,
78 was bad enough, there was only one thing I could think of that would make it
79 any more difficult.....  Well, there goes the light.  Now I really am in a
80 bad way.
81 	What's this?  There is someone pushing behind me.  How rude, you'd
82 think that some people would at least have the decency to walk around...
83 Hey, just a second now.  Someone's tugging at me now.  This really is very
84 rude.  Can't others be left alone in a crisis?
85 	Some of the lights are coming back on now.  Oh, I do feel foolish.
86 It turns out that those that have been poking and prodding me where trying
87 to help, rather than hinder, my progression.  There's my Friend...  and
88 there is the Other.  I guess I've never had it so well off.
89 	Oh great, here comes that hideous, splittering mist again!  Drats.

128 Franklin Pervis sidled up against the graffiti-stained wall and wiped his nose with his sleeve. His beady eyes peered
129 out over his bifocals nervously, waiting for the man he was supposed to meet.
130 He jumped about a foot in the air when a strong hand grabbed his shoulder from behind.
131 "What th-... oh, it's you. God, don't scare me like that. I don't like this part of town."
132 The big black man chuckled. "Aw c'mon, Perv, yo' safe here. Ah'll protect you mah man!"
133 Pervis just shook his head. "Do you have what I want?"
134 The big man chuckled and stared down at the little reporter in front of him. "Yassir, Perv, and a little bit mo!"
135 "What do you mean?"
136 "A little mo' information."
137 "About Delta"
138 ?"
139 The man just smiled and reached into his black leather jacket. He pulled out a brown paper bag and held it toward
140 Franklin. Pervis took it gingerly, holding it up as best he could since it was heavier than the small package implied.
141 "That's a .357, Perv, oughta do the job well 'nough. But, uh, ah'll need 'bout 'nuther bill for that information Ah 
142 mentioned."
143 Pervis dug into his pocket and pulled out a few bills. "What is it?"
144 "Well, Delta is on his way fum Arizona is some jet he rented. Seems his old lady got knocked off in between her gettin'
145 knocked up!" The man chuckled at his own joke.
146 Pervis shuddered. "Who did it?"
147 "Don' know yet. But it seems that Delta's madder 'n hell,  Perv. You better watch out, he may think you did it!"
148 Franklin Pervis just shook his head, and put the gun in his overcoat. It pulled the coat down on the left side, giving
149 the short man an even odder, more lopsided appearance.
150 He thought about Delta V, and the fact that he wanted to kill him. Some sympathy had been generated in the papers for
151 the man, but the bitter irony was that this so-called hero wanted revenge for
152 the killing of his family. But as soon as someone threatened him personally, his first reaction was to threaten someone
153 elses family. And now all of New York City.
154 "Thanks Blue, I appreciate the information. I'll be back in touch soon. I've got a plane to catch."

162      "Fellows... Fellows! Please continue." Dr Macrobius' voice revealed his
163 sentiments towards Fellows' long pause. "You must go on with your story."
164      "Of course Doctor, I am sorry. Well, like I said, the lady from the
165 field was standing there in the forest under a patch of light. She was smiling,
166 and her hands were clasped in front of her. She called my name and I started
167 moving towards her."
168      "Did you recognize her this time? Did her face still seem familiar?"
169      "I still could not associate a name with her face, but I know I had
170 seen her sometime before. I moved towards her, and as I got closer, she held
171 her arms higher. The palms of her hands we turned up, and the light from
172 above made them look like they were glowing. I could hear nothing but my
173 breathing. My eyes were fixed on her palms. And then she..."
174      "Yes Fellows? This is critical now. You must recount what happened."
175      "I... I was only a couple feet from her, and she reached down and took
176 my hands in hers. My hands burned to her touch, but I could ~ot pull away.
177 She looked into my eyes, and I into hers, and the burning went away. The
178 forest seemed to darken, and all I knew was this woman holding my hands,
179 standing in front of me. I could sense nothing else. All that existed was
180 she and I... I am sorry Doctor..."
181      "Fellows, you know you must..."
182      "Yes, I know. I know. She opened her mouth, as if to say something. But I
183 could hear nothing. She moved her lips but no sound came out, or I didn't hear
184 whatever sound she was making. I guess she sensed that I could not hear,
185 because she stopped moving her lips and closed her mouth. Then her eyes...her
186 eyes seemed to grow into pits of ebony, dark foreboding orbs that help no
187 light. And then she screamed."
188      "Screamed? You could hear this scream?"
189      "I could hear it AND I could feel it. I have never felt such terror from
190 a sound before. It shook my whole body, I could feel nothing else but that
191 scream. I closed my eyes, and I felt the burning in my hands, for just a
192 second, then it was gone. I felt strangely moved, and I opened my eyes. It was
193 my bedroom. I was awake. My body was covered with sweat and my throat was
194 dry. I could not go back to sleep, and I came here as soon as I thought you
195 might be in."
196      Macrobius was busy writing in his notepad. A moment later he closed his
197 pad and looked up at Fellows. 
198      "I see why you are so troubled Fellows. You did the correct thing in
199 coming to see me. We have a great deal to talk about."
200      "Then you can help me?" Fellows face pleaded more than his voice did.
201      "Yes, I think I can, but in the end it will be you who will help
202 yourself. I want to..."
203      A NET HQ announcement was coming over the building communications
204 system. When Ian Machinery wished to speak, no man or woman in NET could
205 deny him.
206  
207      "...AGENTS PARITY AND FELLOWS PLEASE REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO LOADING BAY
208 94 FOR IMMEDIATE TRANSPORT. WOULD AGENTS PARITY AND FELLOWS PLEASe REPORT..."
209  
210      "I am sorry Doctor, but this sounds like an emergency. Ian only makes
211 announcements like that when big trouble is in the works."
212      "I know Fellows, good luck. We must speak as soon as you return. Do not
213 forget."
214      "Don't worry Doctor Macrobius, I'm afraid forgetting will be the last
215 thing I could do. Thanks for you help."
216      Parity made haste for the docking bay. NET's HQ was located near a
217 small civilian airport, and the docking bay had a tram to an underground
218 hanger, where a sleek new jet aircraft stood standing by, waiting for two
219 very important passengers.

240    They hurried into the oval office in silence broken only by the whisper of Neolite soles on plush carpeting.
241 The president was waiting, he was livid with rage. The joint chiefs had gathered around the polished mahogany desk
242 as they did in times of crisis. The secretary of Defense slipped through the door, just as the President spoke.
243 He was interrupted by the representative of the NSA,an act he was to soon regret. No one interrupted the President.
244 "Mr President, you must understand that with all the breeder reactors in operation around the world, small amounts ..."  
245 The President exploded into a torrent of expletives,"Understand? Understand, hell. A small amount? 
246 "You call 14 kilograms of weapons grade Plutonium a small amount? You stupid son of a bitch..."
247 The Secretary of Defense, a man known for being cool under fire, eased into the conversation.  The President had great respect f
248 and he listened, as did every man in the room. All eyes were riveted on the gentle features of this great negotiator as the man

253    Quickly regained control. "Gentlemen. Hear me out, please." "Let us place a little of the blame where it rightfully

257 "And I, for one, can not blame him." "NOW-gentlemen what he really wants is McKane." "What we will do is GIVE him McKane."
258 The room was totally silent for a few seconds, and then  the President spoke. "Yes, of course." He pointed a bony finger at the 
259 rose from his desk, and started issuing commands.
260 Pens were snatched from pockets, and notes hurridly made. Telephones were lifted, orders barked. The wheels began to turn.

334 One Long Saturday...
335     (Part 4)
336     
337      Now Jim was getting desperate. He was running out of ideas. Wasn't there anything that would do these little
338 creeps in? Shoot 'em, maybe. Well, it's worth a try.
339      "All right, everybody. Back to the car." He hustled them into the Chevy and locked the yard back up. If this
340 worked, he be back to clean up the mess before Monday morning. If it didn't, he doubted he'd have to worry about
341 it.
342      On the way back to the house, Amogo asked, "What are we doing now?"
343      "Well, I thought you might like to experience some earth amusements before you wiped us all out."
344      "As I have already stated, we have no intention of 'wiping out' the human race. We merely wish to enslave
345 you."
346      That's right, he thought, they just want to enslave us. No big deal. He pulled into the driveway. Telling them to
347 wait, he ducked into the house and came back out with his .30-06 and a box of ammo. Then he drove them up to a nearby
348 gravel pit where he sometimes practiced.
349      "Okay," he said, leading them down into the pit, "This is a game of skill. Normally this," he said, holding up the
350 rifle, "fires a high-velocity lead slug. However, we have these special bullets that are made of hollow plastic and
351 have a red marking dye in them. It's with these bullets that we shoot at each other to see who could hit whom first.
352 It's all in harmless fun, and nobody gets hurt, of course."
353      "Of course." said Amogo. "We have seen this activity practiced before on your television transmissions."
354      "Yeah. Right." He lined them up and walked over to the far side of the pit. He opened the rifle's bolt and snapped
355 six 180-grain hollowpoint bullets into the clip. Then he sat and braced the rifle on his knee, sighting the crosshairs
356 right between Amogo's nonexistant eyebrows.
357      Well, they were ticklish. Every time a bullet struck them and bounced off, they emitted a high-pitched giggle.
358 Otherwise, it didn't even bother them. Jim decided to give up after a ricochet screamed by about a quarter inch above
359 his part. He put the rifle down and groaned.
360      "Admittedly, that was much more pleasurable than the last activities." Amogo said. "What shall we try next?"
361      Jim treated them to a few words that they had never learned from television. "Everybody in the car!" he roared,
362 picking up his gun.
363      On the way back, he had another idea.
364      The seven of them stood at the edge of the pond in his back yard. The aliens eyed the liquid substance
365 uncertainly. they explained that there was no water on their world. How about that, Jim thought. "This activity is
366 called diving. We go underwater for long periods of time and observe the underwater life." In that pond the only
367 underwater life was bugs, frogs, and algae but one should start small. "Surely you've seen this on our television
368 transmissions."
369      "Of course." replied Amogo, "but didn't the humans use some sort of breathing apparatus..."
370      "Fooey! That's just just for people with bad lung conditions! You don't need them. You'll be just fine."
371      After more coaxing he finally convinced them to go in and stay there until he had them come out. They marched
372 single file into the water. Sadly, they didn't dissolve, but they would undoubtedly drown, as they showed no tendancy
373 to float. Jim watched through the scummy green surface as they reached the deepest part and sat down in a circle,
374 becoming completely still. He watched a full five minutes and then left. If this didn't work, he had one last idea to
375 try, and it required some preparation.
376      Two hours later, they were still in the same position on the bottom of the pond, looking like underwater statues.
377 Surely they had drowned by now. Jim waved down at them experimentally.
378      Three of them waved back.

389 (Unfortunately, it's more than I'm usually up for.)  If they change 
390 locations, I'll probably try to make it, but large assembleges of people
391 such as city streets, have a depressing effect on my motivations.

407 And now, on to serious propositions:
408 
409 not so serious
410 
411 simple simple simple simple simple simple simple simple simple
412 
413 When I was 9 I learned survival
414 Taught myself not to care
415 I was my single good companion
416 Taking my comfort there
417 Up in my room I planned my conquests
418 On my own
419 Never asked for a helping hand
420 No one would understand
421 I never asked the pair who fought below
422 Just in case they said no
423 
424 Pity the child who has ambition
425 Knows what he wants to do
426 Knows that he'll never fit the system
427 Others expect him to
428 Pity the child who knew his parents
429 Saw their faults
430 Saw their love die before his eyes
431 Pity the child that wise
432 He never asked did I cause your distress?
433 Just in case they said yes
434 
435 When I was 12 my father moved out
436 Left with a wimper not with a shout
437 I didnt miss him-  he made it perfectly clear
438 I was a fool and probably queer
439 Fool that I was I thought this would bring
440 Those he had left closer together
441 She made her move the moment he crawled away
442 I was the last the woman told
443 She never let her bed get cold
444 Someone moved in-  I shut my door
445 Someone to treat her just the same way as before
446 
447 I took the road of least resistance
448 I had my game to play
449 I had the skill and more-  the hunger
450 Easy to get away
451 Pity the child with no such weapons
452 No defense
453 No escape from the ties that bind
454 Always a step behind
455 I never called to tell her all Id done
456 I was only her son!
457 
458 Pity the child but not forever
459 Not if he stays that way
460 He can get all he ever wanted
461 If hes prepared to pay
462 Pity instead the careless mother
463 What she missed
464 What she lost when she let me go
465 And I wonder does she know
466 I wouldnt call-  a crazy thing to do
467 Just in case she said who?

528 of being treated like a child!" she pouted to the
529 walls.  They kept their opinions to themselves, as usual.  For the
530 umpteenth time, Miranda had asked to go with her father, the Duke, and
531 for the umpteenth time, he said that his trips were "not for a young
532 girl such as you."
533         "But I'm twenty-two now!"  Her complaints hadn't swayed him in
534 the least.  "He'd let me go if he knew that I... NO!  I mustn't tell
535 him: he'd never let me go *anywhere*."  If her father knew that she'd
536 been in his library, studying his old books, he would be very upset. 
537 When she was very young, she had been told never to touch his books;
538 especially the ones on the south wall.
539         As forbidden fruit goes, the more forbidding, the more tasty. 
540 It took a long time, but her resistance finally broke down four years
541 ago, after they returned from exile.  Once into them, she couldn't keep
542 away from the books.  They revealed their knowledge to her, and she
543 learned quickly why she was to have never touched them: they were
544 addictive.  Before she opened the first one, she had figured that they
545 were the source of her father's powers, and now she knew how powerful
546 the black arts could be.
547         She had been an innocent young girl, betrothed to a well-to-do
548 young man.  When her beloved was killed in a rigged duel, she sunk
549 into the depths of remorse.  Wandering aimlessly around the family
550 mansion, she found herself in the library, gaze transfixed on the
551 forbidden bookcase.
552         Now, having secretly studied the books, storing every word into
553 her photographic memory, she felt that it was time to go out on her own. 
554 Her father wouldn't let her go with him on his trips, so she decided to
555 go on a trip of her own.
556         It was a quest, of a sort.  After reading through the series on
557 simple illusions, she had gone on to the physical transformation books. 
558 She read the first three books and found that there was a fourth book
559 that her father didn't have.  The inscription gave a hint as to where
560 her father acquired the books, so the natural idea came to her: Seek out
561 the fourth book of transformations, first by going to the source of the
562 first three.
563         Roughly translated from the original Latin, the inscription
564 read: 
565         To Prospero:
566                 Study these well, and may they bring you
567             the fortune that your name deserves...
568                                 ii orpyak
569 
570 Under the inscription was the sign of the pheonix:  \l/  Miranda
571 recogized this as the sign that her father often used on his private
572 coorespondance.  This ii orpyak was the person that she needed to find
573 first to get the last book.  If she could find the fourth book of
574 transformation, she'd bring it back home for her father.
575 
576         Miranda put the on clothes that she got from the servants'
577 quarters and made up a small pack of what she thought she might need: a
578 small knife, a little rope, some dried fruit and meat, and her favorite
579 veil, a beautiful red, orange and yellow splash of color.  She carefully
580 hid her ring under the rough tunic, and looked out her window for a last
581 time.  Minutes later, she was carefully slipping out into the quiet
582 midnight streets of Milan.

586 I too have heard of the NORTHWEST WRITER'S GUIDE, or whatever.  It's
587 supposed to have listings of lot's almost all of the publishing firms,
588 large, small and micro, in the Northwest.  I believe that their
589 definition of northwest goes from Hawaii to Montana (?) and Alaska
590 to Oregon, possibly including some south of Idaho.

617      "Snoopy!  I'm back!"  The anxious cry went through the barren house
618 until it came to fall upon his ears.  Jenny darted back up the steps to
619 Allen's room to see him brousing through an old copy of Analog.
620      "What did you say?" he yelled back over his shoulder.  He was unaware
621 that she had already made it to his door.
622      "I said, 'I'm back' Snoopy," she replied with a hushed voice.  Her
623 peaceful responce was effective.  Allen turned quickly to see her standing
624 behind him.  "And yes, I'll forgive you for shouting."  Hands together on
625 her lap, she smiled back at him as she leaned against the doorway.  Jenny
