34 I'm not like other girls.  Or so my mother says, looking worried.  And she's
35 right.  Mostly because I understand death which is a good thing now that we 
36 are up to our elbows in it as my dad said except he didn't say elbows
37 It all started when Miss Peach gave us the Chain of Prey assignment. You
38 had to trace who ate who (like from germs and bugs to fish to birds to man)
39 on a paper with pictures of everybody lined up in profile mouths open lined
40 ready to eat the next level down while unbeknownst to them the next level
41 lurked behind.  So I had: germs, bugs, chickens, man, lions, wolves, buzz-
42 ards, worms, and back to germs in a big circle. And old cheery Miss Peach
43 held it up in class and said "Anna has developed an EXCELLENT ecological
44 niche concept."  But what I really got a concept of was: Everybody's food.
45 Everybody's a killer. It was the first solid truth I got out of school so
46 I held onto it.
47 Now that a real murderer has come into our midst, I think I have some in-
48 sight.Or so I told Mr. John Arms the police lieutenant who came to ask me
49 about the day I saw Dr. Robert Bang fall from his 12th floor condominium
50 into the very river which the state was paying him to test for excessive
51 pollutants which they suspect of causing the rise in leukemia hereabouts.
52 That sick splat on the water had assured me that doctor wasn't doing any
53 firsthand research. So I called the cops and they sent me home to get over
54 the shock (even though I was calmer than anybody else blathering all around
55 there) and in a few hours here comes John Arms to take my statement which
56 boils down to this: Dr. Bang had been preying on a lot of people in a lot of
57 ways and was due by the laws of nature to get devoured.

68     Emu came over and looked quickly at the temporal condition
69 indicators.  By the numbers, as Bard had intimated, there was 
70 definitely a strong disturbance nearby.  The largest fluxuations
71 seemed to be tied with the time jumps, rather than with physical
72 proximity or reality jumps.  However, all were being affected.
73     "Lady Tayree, would you please bring me my packsack?  I need
74 my temp-tracker.  Trainor, I have an idea that we need to watch our
75 time jumping very closely."
76     The Scarlette Lion handed over the bag.  "can your tracker tell
77 us something of the disturbance?"
78     "Unless I miss my guess," interjected Fencer, smoothing the fur
79 on his canine friend's collar, "Emu is going to try to use his 
80 temp-tracker as a way of homing in on this so-called `entity'.  I
81 would suggest, Emu, that you use the short-wave settings, as they
82 penetrate the reality barriers much cleaner."
83     "I didn't realise you were versed in paratemporal trackers,
84 Fencer.  You're right, though if I can get a fix on it first, the
85 long-wave would allow a greater distance from the thing without
86 loosing contact.  Assuming, of course, that it has some psi 
87 emminations and that I can locat them."
88     As he talked, Emu reached into his bag and withdrew a polished
89 aluminum box with various control and readouts.  After fiddling
90 with it a little, a slight cloud of annoyance crossed his face.
91     "is there something wrong, sir emu?" asked Lady Tayree.
92     "No, not really," was the answer.  "It just needs a slight
93 adjustment."  With that, Emu thwacked his delicate para-temporal
94 tracker quite sharply against the edge of the the control panel.
95     "Hey, that was almost my finger!"
96     "Sorry Bard.  Now maybe it'll work."
97     Sure enough, two more LED's lit up, and Emu smiled a little.
98 Reading from the ships panel, Emu tuned the tracker and got a small 
99 signal from the time-stream indicator.
100     Trainors ears perked up.  "Anything?"
101     Yes, we're quite close to it, and since it does register on this
102 gizmo, it must be somewhat sentient.  I would suggest that we stop
103 making time jumps until we reach the proper reality and physical
104 proximity.  By the readings on your ship's sensors, this thing can
105 move much quicker through time than anything else.  As long as we
106 move quickly through the intervals, we should be able to keep
107 ahead and away from it."
108     At Trainor's nod, the bard reached up and cut out the time
109 jump generator.

112       Almost precisely six hours and ninety lines later, I have

130   sometimes i look out on across the waters, even on cloudy days, and it
131 lightens my heart.  then there are other times, when the wind is calm and
132 the waters smooth, that shadows find their way into my chest.  they make it
133 hard to breath sometimes, and every once in a while i have to swallow real
134 hard.  maybe it's not really the waters.  i might be looking out the wrong

138 Tina walked briskly thru the market, it seemed as though a nicer day 
139 could not have been ever created.  She felt incrediably good, and looked
140 it too.  Investments had been paying off, and luxury was no longer a dream
141 but reality.  She stopped and carefully chose fresh fruits and vegetables
142 for dinner, while humming a little tune.  As she paid for her purchases
143 she watched the clerks eyes light up at the sight of her rings. <flash-flash>
144 "Life is a bitch and then you die" she ammused to herself.  Walking confidently
145 out the door.  A face...  No!  He's seen me, let me out of here!  Her
146 groceries went quickly into the dumpster as she took flight.

149     I always thought I was above such feelings. I had never really felt such
150 a burning in my soul before. I had never seen my former partner and mate in
151 the arms of another either.
152     It was like a slow-motion sequence in a bad kung-fu movie. I went through
153 a gamut of feelings until I at last landed on the one true emotion that would
154 set the pace for the rest of the day; jealousy.
155     They were walking along together, face to face, arm in arm, heart to
156 heart, lost in each other's being. I was an outsider, an intruder who chose
157 the wrong time to walk up the steps and find out what it is like to have
158 something you have loved and cherished first torn away, and then dangled
159 just out of reach.
160     They saw me walking towards them, and in an instant they broke their
161 contact and slowed their pace. No words were spoken, none needed to be.
162 The atmosphere seemed intense, heavy beyond belief. I could hardly
163 breath. Only their faces and their actions told me what they were going
164 through. 
165     We approached one another, I walking towards the office, they walking
166 away. Away to what? I wondered. All my thoughts were tinged with anger and
167 betrayal. I knew where they are going. I knew what they planned to do,
168 together. I knew I would never be able to forget this moment, and what, just
169 by my seeing them together, they had done to me.
170     We passed, still not a word was spoken. My temples pounded and my throat
171 was dry. I took two more steps and stopped. The jealous rage swelled within
172 me and I swung around, my thoughts not really clear. It wasn't important
173 what I did, just so long as I did something.
174     They were walking faster now, arm in arm again. Just as they were about to
175 turn the corner, she looked back over her shoulder. Our eyes met for an
176 instant, and everything I had pent up drained in that same instant. She moved
177 on, and so did I.
178     Into the office, where every fixture was a memory of the times we had in
179 the past. Times together when she was in my arms and I was in hers. Times
180 when we were lost in each others eyes. Times that I knew where gone forever.

215   I really thought I had a chance this time. She looked lonely.
216 I am lonely. She seemed receptive to conversation. It helped me
217 feel better about myself too. She was interested in the
218 discussion and added a great deal of her own input. Both of us
219 shared equally in the conversation. She seemed genuinely
220 interested in me. I was certainly interested in her. I tried

259 John Arms sat at the tdesk in my room taking notes. He is a heavy serious man
260 with a round head and straight dark hair. He hardly ever blinks. "Can you 
261 think of anyone who might wish to harm Dr. Bang?" He asked.
262 Well, there are a lot of people. Like Susie's dad. Susie lives in a big house
263 on a hill where youca can see the whole town. The house looks like it should
264 be in a magazine and so does Susie's mom, Mrs. Silk. She's tall, blond, tan, 
265 and always smiling or holding her mouth open as if she's saying "Oooooh.." 
266 just in case somebody might want to take her picture which nobody does since
267 she's too old to be a New York model anymore and since nobody takes pictures 
268 of models anyway in a town this small. But she always dresses like Linda
269 Evans even around the house just in case something comes up.
270 Which it did two Thursdays ago in the form of Robert Bang.  Me and Susie
271 went to her house early because our soccer game got cancelled and saw her
272 and Dr. Bang on the deck having drinks even though it was only 3 o'clock in 
273 the afternoon. Mrs. Silk had on an electric blue silk blouse and her "Oooohh"
274 expression. Dr. Bang kept looking at her and talking softly.  Every once in a
275 while he'd touch her shoulder and lean a little closer. He looked like a
276 wolf salking a big blond lion in the chain of prey.
277 Susie and me went in the house and played video games for awhile, but she
278 was too spaced out to concentrate. "That guy," she said, "He's go a lab in
279 the hospital where my mom does charity work. My mom likes doctors." Susie's
280 dad is a lawyer. Her dad came home a little while later. He'd been playing
281 racketball and was sweaty and happy. He's a strong stocky guy like a bull.
282 He put his curly head down and charged at Susie like a bull but hugged her
283 instead.  She pointed at the scene on the porch.  He looked, got very quiet
284 and calm. "More charity work, eh, Sport? Hey, quit worrying." "Are you
285 gonna leave, Daddy?" she asked.  "Not without you, Babe," he stroked her
286 hair. "Maybe not at all. Maybe I won't have to."
287 Now this would never happen at my house. My Dad would charge right out 
288 there and say "Hi there, glad to meecha. If I ever see you alone with my 
289 wife on my porch at 3 o'clock in the afternoon again I'll tear your ears off.
290 Want another drink?"

303 
304 Maybe you're tired of reading about program piracy. There's been a lot said about it lately. But I have one or two extra
305 houghts on the subject.
306 
307 Recently (September 1984) I was chatting with the author of the program FBACKUP. You probably know it: it's sometimes 
308 called FAST BACKUP, sometimes the FOUR-MINUTE BACKUP. Everybody must have a copy by now. In contrast to the single disk 
309 backup program that comes with the 1541 and which takes half an hour or more to perform a disk backup, the fast backup 
310 program will do the job in four minutes, sometimes less.
311 
312 It's quite cleverly written - to describe it technically, it formats as it writes in order to get this amazing speed. 
313 When it wants you to change disks so as to continue the backup process, it whoops at you. Perhaps I don't need to tell 
314 you all this... it seems as if most people I talk to have a copy.
315 
316 This celebrated program was written for commercial distribution by Thomas Tempelmann, a student who lives in Oldenburg, 
317 est Germany. It has been for sale in Europe for some time now. There were problems lining up a U.S. distributor, and so
318 the program has never been offered for sale in the U.S.A. or Canada.
319 
320 Thomas told me his total sales on the program - world wide - amounts to seventy copies. I suspect there are at least ten
321 thousand copies in North America alone. If all Thomas' sales had been to North America (and as far as is known, none of 
322 hem were), that would mean that over 99% of the copies in circulation were not purchased.
323 
324 Seventy copies. If you have a copy of FBACKUP, how do you feel about that? Would it be better if you didn't know the 
325 author's name; if the program were written by somebody unknown rather than Thomas Tempelmann? Would it be better if you 
326 thought maybe he has sold sold a million copies, so won't miss your royalty?
327 Seventy copies. Listen, you can't be blamed, right? It wasn't even for sale in North America. So how else could you get 
328 a copy except from a friend? And it's a really fantastic program that everyone needs, right?
329 
330 We seem to be entering a new era where pirates are proud of their work. Bootleg copies are signed by the pirates who 
331 broke the protection. There's now a regularly published newsletter which deals with how to make 'unprotected backup' 
332 disks. The newsletter names commercial software packages, details the protection schemes they use, and gives precise 
333 procedures to remove the protection.
334 
335 Thomas Tempelmann's story might have a happy ending. He told me he hopes to sell FBACKUP rights to Commodore for general
336 istribution. It's a first class utility and would look great on a bonus disk. It's certainly well tested - thousands of
337 people have used it. So Thomas might - possibly - eventually receive respectable compensation for his work. But it won't
338 be from the sale of seventy copies.
339 
340 How do you think such an experience would affect Thomas Tempelmann's attitude towards developing new software? Well, 
341 Thomas is not the type of person to let small setbacks like this slow him down. Six months ago, he wrote a fast disk 
342 program that will load software at remarkable speed. About the time it was completed, he was visited by a young person 
343 to whom he showed the system. During the demonstration, Thomas was called away to the phone. The kid stole a copy, and 
344 there are hundreds of copies around West Germany now. Thomas doesn't think he'll ever put his fast disk on the market 
345 now.
346 
347 Thomas' current project has something to do with reading sequential files from other computers disks - perhaps Apple, 
348 Atari, and/or IBM PC. But he doesn't talk about it much, and he doesn't show his new system to anyone. I get the 
349 impression that he's learned not to trust people. I wonder why?
350 
351 Maybe you hope to write software some day soon. And maybe you plan to work hard, learn efficient coding, get some good 
352 insights into machines and people, and put together a program that will be universally admired. It will be useful; it 
353 will be elegant; it will be efficient; it will be easy and convenient; and it will do something that hasn't been done 
354 before.
355 
356 And maybe you'll get it all together, and your program will be a sensation. Everybody will admire it, everybody will 
357 want it - more, everybody will need it.
358 
359 And maybe you'll sell seventy copies.
360 
361 [It is we who really lose here. We will not see the fast load program, and we may never see the program that reads other
362 formats. If we do, they will be awfully expensive and inconveniently protected. Hmmm. When will we learn? - G.W.]
363 
364 
365 I found the above on Zarahemla & thought it deserved a wider audience.

371     Hello.
372      About Russia: Most of the fear of the USSR is left over from the McArthy
373 days. It is easy to look back on it with all wisdom hindsight brings and say
374 that the people who persecuted alleged communiists were foolish and evil, but
375 remember that less than 10 years before a man and his country tried to take
376 over the world for the sake of taking over the world (namely Hitler). Consid-
377 er also that Rafter the revolution 
378 r
379 (sorry, enter only)
380 Russia invaded Georgia and the other countries now behind the Iron Curtain;
381 in fact, when Hungary decided they didn't want to be communist anymore, Russia
382 invaded and killed thousands of civillians but practically no soldiers or heads
383 of state.
384  To people who had just experienced one of the most senseless wars, these 
385 actions were too familar. If you found out that the neo-nazis in Oregon were 
386 trying to take over 
387 s
388 (sorry) Salem wouldn't you try to keep your friends and children from going 
389 there? That's what they thought they were doing.
390  Even now there are valid reasons for distrusting the USSR. i.e. When they have
391 border trouble in Asia they send the European armies to deal with it. If there 
392 is trouble on the European border they send Asian troops. No shared ancestry 
393 between opposing forces-get it?

396 haven't done this in quite some time.

418 It was still a dark, but not a stormy knight.  Sir Ben of Fish was dead tired.
419 He had just finished a 5 month trek across the Eastern continent.  From the 
420 Inland Hills of Miami, he had traveled all the way to the southern coast of 
421 Kansas because there had been reports that the evil Jeffslime and his sidekick
422 Gunnar Webhead had been seen there.  His trusty steed, Rustbucket II, sauntered
423 down the coast.  Sir Ben was almost asleep when all of a sudden, he was 
424 surrounded by a gang of vigilante Beach Bums!  They surrounded him, waving 
425 their driftwood sticks around brutally.  Sir Ben screamed his Fish battle cry.
426 "G U R G L E !" he cried.  Then he pulled out his sword viciously, and fainted.

445 Leonard, don't fear for the fastload program,if it is in Germany,it will
446 soon be here in the US. Piracy seems the norm here, and even more so in
447 the Orient. The only way to keep your program from beeing stolen is never,
448 NEVER release it to anyone. Of course you can sell the manual, and give
449 away the program, unless it is just a simple utility that doesn't need
450 a manual.
451    But don't bother with trying to embarrass the pirates, or appealing
452 to their 'better side'. Unless you have a method of preventing copying
453 disks that works, crying about it is less than worthless.

456 "All right, Milch, where to now?"
457 The Doctor had this annoying habit of putting his finger directly upon the
458 problem at hand.  Usually, this wasn't annoying, but it was when I didn't have
459 the foggiest idea.  I told him as much.
460 "Come, now.  We've travelled countless parsecs, years, and...well, er, a couple
461 of time lines to get here, so I suppose it would be proper for us to *DO*
462 something, wouldn't you think?"  I ignored him, and looked at the surroundings.
463 Grann already had.  "I see a large house upon the side of that hilly area,
464 there.  If communism means what I think it does, then homes should be equal-
465 unless someone of power occupies that structure."
466 "Perhaps you are right, Grann.  No harm could befall us to get a closer look,
467 anyway.  Doctor, would you lead our little expedition?"
468 The Doctor gave a little nod, and we were on our way.  Only then did I feel
469 something nagging at me- a presence, if you will.  It was faint, but 
470 undoubtedly there.  Then another moment- TWO presences!  The second seemed
471 strange and familiar at the same time, unlike the first; it had a foreboding
472 tinge to it.  Pondering this, I followed Grann and the Doctor onward.

474 hello all, I'm sorry if I took too much time tonight, but I have not been 
475 on in over three months or so, and I wanted to read and download everthing
476 so I can print it out later... also, I'd like to talk to other people on a pr
477 ivate system like CBBS/Aloha.... If anyone is interested, please leave mail to 
478 Scott Wirth.  
479 MIG: Hello!! Is there sometime I can call the Nerd and that you will be around
480 to chat???   Let me know, Ok? I also have a few questions about CP/M
481 ==========
482 Bad: try reading the message your talking about, helps make YOUR entry more
483 understandable.  As it is right now, it's hard to figure out what you are 
484 talking about, you totaly got Leonards message backwards - or maybe I did - 
485 But anyway, please try to understand the topic on which you'd writting about.
486 ====-=-=-=
487 Hitler wasn't trying to 'take over the world'... He was trying to get rid
488 of the filth, which was anything but the arian race for they were the supreme.
489 His idea was to secure the arian race a high position in this world, the 
490 highest.   Like Japan being so isolated for so long, they didn't want to be
491 messed up by other races but they were forced to.   Hitler wasn't trying to
492 take over the world, he was trying to preserve it.
493 Now, don't get me wrong, I don't agree with the way he went about his ultimate
494 plan, I think he was a real loser.  A briliant man, but still a loser.  But
495 still his idea wasn't to bad.

498 Scott Wirth:We know each other? I havn't been near Le Nerd for weeks, and
499 probably will not be for more weeks, say fifty at least. Questions about

517 There is some evidence that Japan didn't cry uncle until we started going
518 throughthe 
519 through the motions of dropping a THIRD bomb (recon flights, droping test
520 bombs, leaflets, etc.)  The American public was anticipating a bloody in-
521 vasion of the Japanese mainland and wanted the war OVER!  My father served
522 in the Navy in the pacific and would most certainly have been involved in
523 the invasion (note: Destroyers are Expendable and Disposable... I think 
524 dad was on a destroyer....)  Records say the military was anticipating
525 1,000,000 casualties on our side and 10,000,000 Japanese casualties.  
526 Conclusion:  If not for the A-Bomb, I might not be here. (no smart cracks.)
527 Conclusion:  Possable the A-Bomb is the reason the world has enjoyed 
528              relative peace.  Remember WWI and WWII in less than 40 years..

569     From Prometheus; Devilish
570     Leonard; The tract against piracy was interesting, although the subject has
571 been beaten to death.  Speaking as one who lacks an opinion on the issue, most
572 people will think what they want to about piracy.  They all have their gimmicks
573 for explaining it away, whether it be manuals or men with guns.
574     Since you seem to have oodles of compters and dozens of tracts and stories
575 and things, you might consider putting up a board for these pleasantries.
576     It's worth a shot.

581     in the cockpit... voices and arguments... courses and altitudes... in the
582 passenger compartment... tilean stands at a map... allean is in a pool of light
583 cast by the screen... the others are reclining in their seats... the dc-10
584 trembles with winds blown from the deep crevaces and peaks below them...
585     suspended in the air... the deserts mountains flow beneath them... the
586 plane trembles again... the only noise is of the engines... and the two fresh
587 agents snoring quietly...
588     allean is viewing the libyan records... explosives placed at which oil well
589 and when... who is supervising which well... where does he come from... if there
590 is anyone heading this project... allean will find out who...
591     tilean is plotting the routes to reach the oasis of maradan by evening...
592 it will take a certain amount of planning to get everyone in position... their
593 taskc require even more planningg than that...
594     each agent was going to sabotage or delay the project somehow... tilean was
595 going to establish an running network of spies and informants... allean was to
596 find the man behind the plan... quarrie was to manually sabotage a certain oil
597 well... and o'kearns was to sabotage another oil well...
598     since a chain is as strong as it's weakest link... each of them was their
599 own chain... as long as one of them held... everything held... it was not a
600 kind policy... alhough it usually acheived much more...
601     and still... tilean mapped... allean read... the other two drifted off to
602 sleep... it seemed silly to think the fate of africa was going to depend on
603 these men...
