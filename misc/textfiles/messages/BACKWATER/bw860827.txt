169                      Elforson woke to the sound of a dry brnch breaking, and
170 looked down out of his erie to see the massive body of a thirty-foot anaconda
171 flowing up the tree toward him.It was already on the branch supporting his
172 nest, and coming up fast, despite its massive weight.Elforson desperately
173 scanned the surrounding treetops for a convienient branch, but could see 
174 only small branches below him.
175            He hung by his fingertips to he edge of the nest, and dropped,
176 grabbing at the brach whipping up toward him.His fingers gripped hard, and
177 the branch ripped off.He let go the branch he was holding, and grabbed at 
178 the next.His arms nearly jerked out of their sockets, Elforson hung, his
179 shoulders on fire.He swung, agonizingly from side to side, his feet reaching
180 out for the trunk.
181 
182            Elforson reached the ground with little time to spare, for the 
183 anaconda had not yet given up on this quarry.He  ran, leaping over bushes,
184 streams, and small trees.His right foot caught under a vine, and Elforson
185 crashed to the ground, and lay still.He had no coice, his foot was still 
186 entwined in the vine.He struggled to free it, glancing over his shoulder,
187 where, just above the undergrowth, a large flat head was approaching, a meas-
188 ured metre from the ground.Elforson leaped to his feet, only to crash down
189 again, wincing in pain, as his wrenched ankle protested bearing any weight.
190            With a little more care, Elforson erected himself once more,
191 and staggered on again.His brown-grey jumpsuit was torn and dirty, his leg
192 cut and bleeding.He was dimly aware as he ran of a shriek, almost human in
193 timbre, behind him.He stumbled and fell, rolled, and saw what was happening.
194 The anaconda behind him had found easier prey, a baby gibbon.Whilst it was
195 a pity, Elforson was grateful to be alive, and gave the gibbon not a second
196 thought.Already his mind was ajusting to live or die of nature, and his 
197 intellect made no protest of morality.
198 
199            As night fell, it found Elforson some ten miles from the crash
200 site, and he now had an objective in mind.He knew, that some fifty miles 
201 from his present position, there was an olsd experimental station.It was a
202 tropospheric scatter station, and, if he was lucky, There might be some 
203 method of letting the outside world know where he was.It was but a slim chance,
204 yet he knew that any hope was precious, if only for its ability to keep him
205 going.Elforson slept.

215 I see talent in the words of Adric. Estheticism. Prose worthy of the
216 designation. What it needs is seasoning. Uncounted tips and hint gained over
217 the space of time. One of which, being arrogant enough to suggest it now, is
218 placing one to two spaces after every sentence. So take the advice of others
219 seriously. Think about. Reject it at will, of course. But don't ignore it as
220 I might have wanted to. Sometime else,

249                           like you said, Opos, I'm basically inexperienced.
250                         Thanx for constructive criticism.
251 
252                 Elforson looked up towards the ridge ahead, marvelling at
253 
254 the verdant beaty ahead, yet aware that it contained danger on all sides.
255   The last glimpse he had seen of the tropospheric scatter station was well
256 past an hour ago, and at least seven miles.  He trudged on, his ankle barely
257 bothering him, as his mind worked on the possible methods of communication.
258  He knew it was naive to hope to be able to use the main transmission dishes,
259 as their power supply would be dead.A tought struck home, as he realized that
260  they would have been powered by an on-site generator.  It was just concievable
261 that some fuel remained, but, considering his limited knowledge of engineeering,
262 he had little hope of running the scatter station.What he might do is set a
263 smoke signal for a spotter plane to see.  He realised that this wasn't practical
264 , as no-one knew he was flying in this area.  After all, the local government
265 wasn't over-fond of Enlish speaking people.  
266 
267            His mind was forced back to the present by the cliff ahead of him.
268  He would have to scale this to keep his line-of-sight of the station.He 
269  took out his climbing helmet, ropes, pitons, and gun, in preperation for
270 
271  the assult.  Looking up the cliff, it struck him that there were no 
272 convienient outcrops or trees to attach his ropes to.  There was, however, a
273 chimney that looked scaleable.  Of course, on that first cliff, he had had a
274 largge tree in which he had lodged his rope, and he was not looking forward
275 to free ascent up this chimney.
276 
277               Halfway up, he happened to look back along his line of travel.
278   Following it, some fifteen miles back, were two helicopters, of an anti-
279 quated military design.  He realised that his plane had been discovered, and
280 that if they found him, he was in trouble.As an Enlish speaker, and, moreover,
281 an American, his reception would be far from pleasant.He set himself a faster
282 pace up the cliff, knowing that at their present distance, he was still 
283 invisible to the pilots of the choppers.He was but a ew metres from the crest,
284 and he paused to rest.
285 
286               Luckily for him, he was under a bush, so when the second flight
287 of choppers passed directly overhead, scaring him badly, he wasn't seen.  He
288 
289 tried to crawl deeper under the bush, as they continued their search pattern.
290   It dawned on him then that as they would meet about five miles back from
291 his present position, he was safe.  Undoubtably they would ignore the sector
292 in the other flight's pattern, so he moved on as best he could.  Once at the
293 top, he paused only longe enough to take a compass bearing on the station,
294 and moved on at a steady trot.He was aware of the multitudes of life around
295 him, as not far off, a troupe of gibbons chased one of the jungle's few cats,
296 apparantly a panther, away from their young.
297 
298              He idly wondered about adopting an arbourial mode of travel,
299 but realised that this was mere fancy, as not many branches would support
300 the weight of a man.The colours around him were so vivid that they played
301 tricks on his eyes.  He seemed to see movement where none was.It was only
302 from the corners of his eyes that he saw these raopid bursts of apparant motion.
303   Not unnaturally, he became a little paranoid, and began to turn in his 
304 tracks as he walked, attempting to cover all angles equally.
305              
306              This time there could be no mistake!!After two hours of the 
307 " movements, " he was sure that this one had been a face!!
308 
309                                                     Adric.

352      It just doesn't pay to show off. I found that out the hard way. Let me
353 tell you about it:
354      I had just gotten a brand new used '74 Camaro. Beautful car, nice blue
355 paintjob, mags, whitewalls, almost no scratches. I'm pretty damn proud of that
356 car, if I do say so myself. And the girls, hell, they love a fast car. I knew a
357 guy who had a car like this and he had to book reservations for it. No kidding.
358 And at least half the time he wound up in tha back seat with 'em. Jeez, I
359 thought I couldn't miss!
360      I was coming home from the laundromat and stopped at this four-way on
361 Wilson. Sitting at the bus stop on the opposite corner were two choice chicks.
362 I mean, neither one of the had to be more than 17, and, since it was so hot,
363 they were dressed in shorts and *very* tight fitting tops. Real prime stuff.
364 The taller one had no bra and a pair on her that I couldn't believe. Smother me
365 in those and I die happy. Anyways, they were both looking in my direction. I
366 decided, hell, I'd race past 'em, impress 'em with my rod (the car), and come
367 back around the block and see if I could pick 'em up. Real bright idea.
368      I'm kinda inexperienced with a stick shift (among other things), and that
369 was my downfall. I shoved the knob forward and floored it. The car went
370 "Ka-hoomp! Ka-hoomp!" twice and died right in the middle of the intersection.
371      I had the damn thing in third.
372      I took it out of gear and turned the key: "rrrrRRRRrrrrRRRRrrrr..."
373 Flooded.
374      It was hot, but that's not the reason I'm sweating. I look up and the
375 girls are staring at me like I'd just come down from Mars or something. I tried
376 not to blush too hard as I turned the key again.
377      "HOOONNNK!!"
378      I almost jumped out the window. I look to my right, at the street
379 I'm now blocking, and there's some geek in a beatup Chevy pickup that looked
380 like it had been painted with housepaint, leaning out the window and shouting
381 things at me that I don't care to repeat. I turn the key again and the engine
382 roars to life. Hell with it. I pop him the finger as I throw it in gear and
383 floor it.
384      The car starts moving forward at about five miles an hour. Third gear
385 again. I throw one last, longing look at the girls as I hit the clutch and put
386 it in first. The car started putting on some speed.
387      I don't know where the guy in the Chevy had originally intended to go but
388 he was now right on my tail, laying on the horn all the way. I think he might
389 have been a little peeved at my gesture earlier. And I don't know what he had
390 under the hood, but there was no way on God's green earth I was gonna lose him.
391      I'm starting to worry now. We're both tooling up Wilson, which is a
392 residential street, at about fifty. If someone pulled out of a cross street, or
393 a kid or something went into the road, well, that would be all she wrote. But
394 if I slowed down, he'd ram me from behind, which he'd already tried. The guy
395 was nuts.
396      Luck ws with me for once. Up ahead, a cop was pulling out from a side
397 street. I missed him. He didn't. I hit the brakes. It was just a sideswipe. I
398 watched as the cop and the psycho both got out of their cars, shaken but
399 unhurt. The cop got his gun out and put it to the psycho's head and I decided
400 to get the hell out of there before he thought to get my license number.
401      I waited until I was parked in my driveway before I had my nervous
402 breakdown. I sat in the car for a long time, thinking over the whole fiasco.
403 All this just to impress a couple of lousy girls. The last I saw of them, I
404 knew I'm made a definite impression.
405      
406      They were probably still laughing.

411 become stable once more, but that metal door was still there. And even though

451                  Elforson was breathing hard, his breath coming in quick,
452 short gasps.He was drenched with sweat, and only half was from his exertions,
453 as he ran for his life.At least, so he saw it.  The faces had kept up with
454 him for the past five arduous miles.His chet was shot with pains, his legs
455 felt like wood, his feet lead.  Whilst he was in decent physical shape, he
456 hadn't run like this since high school, (not including his training for
457 fencing, his other main hobby/sport.)  His feet crashing down in agonies
458 at each impact, he was near the end of his energy reserves, and he was very,
459  very, frightened.  Those faces he had glimpsed were smeared with a green
460 dye, in a sort of ritualized camouflage pattern.He remembered a film he had
461 seen as a teenager about a lost tribe who used this stuff.  They had been
462 called the Invisible People, and were feared by the other tribes in the
463 film.  He had heard tell that the film was based in reality to some extent.
464 
465        That was why he was running as if the hounds of Heralthing were at his
466 heels.  His ears heard a whizz,- thunk, and as he ran, he wondered why that
467 sound had unpleasant connotations.  looking up to his right, he remembered.
468  It was the sound of an arrow, biting into the wood of a tree, not six inches
469 to the right of his head.  He dived, and rolled up behind a tree, standing
470 with his back against it, and began to try to peer around it.  Something
471  made him realise that he had stopped breathing, and he wanted to know why.
472 
473         The answer made itself apparant by putting its hand up in a gesture
474 of peace, whilst the other held a sturdy spear to his breast.  Elforson froze.
475   He tried to smile an engaginrg smile, but instead, his jaw hung slack, and,
476  making vauge mewling sounds, he sunk into a weak-kneed squat.  His captor
477 squatted also, but with an obvious lack of weakness in his knees.
478   
479         Elforson then almost passed out, as his captor grinned broadly, and
480 said, in considerably better English than Elforson's own,
481   
482         " Hello Stranger.We would not hurt you for any reason, and were, in
483 fact, trying to keep you away from the territory of the smugglers.  I will
484 return, but for the moment, I must go.  Fear not, I go for help."
485 
486         Elforson's face clearly showed his considerable astonishment.  His
487 " captor " obviously found this hilarious, for, with a mischievious grin,
488 he said,
489         " If we do meet again--why, we shall smile. If not, why then this
490 parting was well made."
491 
492          As Elforson blinked in surprise, his friend vanished into the bushes,
493 leaving Elforson wtih the unnerving impression of vanishing into thin air.
494 Staggered, he climbed a tree to wait in, and, halfway up, recognised the
495 quote as Shakespeare, Brutus and Cassius before battle.His mind in turmoil,
496 he once again slept.
497          
498           He awoke to a stead shaking of his branch, accompanied by the 
499 words,
500       " We must away, ere break of day, as some more famous, if fictional
501 dwarves once said, ccording to Mr.Tolkien!!"
502        It was only then that Elforson noticed his friend's diminuative size,
503 not more than four feet tall.
504 
505                                                               Adric.

509         A small boy heard the ocean roar,
510         "There are secrets on my distant shore
511         But beware my child the ships bell's wail,
512         Wait not too long to start the sail."
513         
514         So quickly come and go the years
515         And a young adult stands abeach - with fears.
516         "Come on, come on," the ocean cussed .
517         "Time passes on, Oh sail you must."
518         
519         Now it's business in middle - age prime
520         And maybe tomorrow there'll be time.
521         Now is too soon - It's raining today.
522         Gone, all gone - years are eaten away.
523         
524         An old man looks out, still feeling the lure
525         Yet he'll suffer the pain than go for the cure.
526         The hair is white, the step's with care
527         
528         So all too soon the secrets are buried 
529         Along with him and regrets he carried
530         And it's not for loss of secrets he cried 
531         But rather because he'd never tried.

538   In the glow of a dying campfire a solitary figure watched
539 images form and reform in the glowing coals.  His thoughts
540 turned to times past and friends long departed.  His jouney
541 had seemed interminable, and perhaps it was.  A sharp pain
542 woke him from his reverie, and he brushed the glowing coal
543 from his ragged and tattered kilt, then pushed another branch
544 onto the coals.

594 Dozing in front of the warming fire, the Innkeeper through half closed lids
595 watched the flames flicker and dance before him. As he watched, the flames
596 seemd to take on shape and form. A grove of trees against a black backdrop.
597 In time a figure became visible just behind the flames A man much travel 
598 worn and tired. He sat as if he were on the other sode of the flames of
599 the hearth itself. But of course that was not so, the rear of the hearth
600 was of the best firestone to be found, and not an open space. 
601 Of course the stone did come from the quaries to the west, in an area known
602 to have great magics in the very earth itself. So perhaps there was something
603 to this image. Or maybe it is just the dreaming of an old and tired man,
604 his eyes playing tricks on him. The man on the other side of the flames
605 seemed familar though where from it was uncertain. The clothing was odd, 
606 a dress? No, a kilt! ################# The Innkeeper ########################
