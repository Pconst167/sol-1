 26                 Love, Willamette Week Style
 27                     by Karyn S. Hunting
 28  
 29      Allow me to begin by striking a familiar chord with readers of
 30 the Willamette Week personals: "SYNCRONICITY, ANYONE?"  Flip anyone's
 31 switch?  It's really me, and no, my name's NOT Susan, is it?  Well,
 32 enough with the rhetorical for now, and on to some answers...
 33      Lest some balk at the unfamiliar by-line, I truly am an M, (candy
 34 shell and all). A reinstated M, that is. You see, I deactivated myself
 35 (the red button on the left) circa 1986. And then, thanks to a personal
 36 (sorry) re-realization of the validity of Jung's essays on "the S word,"
 37 via an impulsive ad in the much touted and widely perused Willamette
 38 Week magazine, I reinstated myself circa not too long ago. Make sense
 39 yet?  Okay, I give. It went something like this:
 40      Boyfriend (whose favorite phrase was, "You Menses people are too
 41 weird for me...") for a year and a half. Frustration for 17.5 months of
 42 that. Perseverance until March last, when I met one of those tall, dark,
 43 gorgeous Chippendale types (TDGCT's) and flung caution, security, and
 44 fidelity (okay, sort of) to the wind. Peace and quiet until I called an
 45 old "companion" (another TDGCT-my classic prerequisite to
 46 anything-anyone-worth doing). Contentment until I realized why it never
 47 worked in the first place (yes, Virginia, there really IS a left side to
 48 that bell curve - that's why they named it that way)...
 49      We're up to July 1991 now.
 50      Well, jeez, I figured. I met Mr. Un-M when he placed an ad in WW.
 51 Do smart men read this kind of smut, too?  Aha, thought I. I have a
 52 theorem, a hypothesis, and an urgent mental/hormonal need to meet a guy
 53 that can do more than grunt and look "stupid but cute" when he's not
 54 lying down. So, being a modern day Nike fan with a cause, I just did it.
 55 Five days and $112.70 later, my impulse stared back at me as I gingerly
 56 opened my new WW issue.
 57      (Since Michael says to keep it to about 5K, the text isn't here,
 58 but for a modest fee...)  I asked, more so in my "voice mail ad" than
 59 the written one, for a definite TDGCT.  With an IQ in the three digits.
 60 Being the generous, though perhaps picky, soul that I am, I offered
 61 Bonus Points for any/all of the following: over 6', dark hair, tan,
 62 hairy chest, and "to-die-for looks." Silly me.
 63      After the contestants started rolling in, I anxiously typed away
 64 each night, entering their qualifications and amusing statements into my
 65 database. (Yes, database.)  I called about five of them the first two
 66 weeks.  Met a few.   TDGCT's, yes, surprisingly.  Synchronicity (my ad
 67 title, mind you), not really.  Bonus points, all but one. (He was
 68 blonde. Two blondes together... well... couldn't bring myself to try
 69 it.) I continued on, leaving the database project in the dust after
 70 about 150. Got over 350 altogether to date. Or, rather, not to date.
 71 (But that is not the question, is it?)
 72      "So," Michael asks one day, "what kind of responses did you get?"
 73 (I still hadn't gone back to a TGIF yet.)  Final demographic run-down
 74 was kinda like this, for those of you who are into the means and can
 75 wait for the ends: Winners for most common comment were, "I'm not
 76 intimidated" (made ME wonder a bit), and "I want the Bonus Points" (the
 77 gimmick worked). Most common professions (in order): physicist/
 78 scientist, computer pro, business owner/president, attorney, professor,
 79 and "unspecified." Age? I asked for 30.2-43.5.  Most were 38 to 45 (I
 80 didn't specify mathematical aptitude). Most were longwinded - couldn't
 81 get it all in within 2 minutes (please, no pun assumptions - I wouldn't
 82 know). Overall?  Pretty impressive as a group, I must say: articulate,
 83 educated, humorous, intelligent (ooooooh, gimme more!), and seemingly
 84 "nice guys."
 85      Oh, almost forgot. Their reaction to (it was in my ad to attract
 86 "the right stuff") MENSA? (1) Are you SURE you're cute, too? (2)
 87 Finally! (3) I'm impressed/intrigued/ fascinated. (4) What's MENSA? (5)
 88 Are you really one of THEM? (6) That's nothing but a mutual admiration
 89 society for social illiterates (these were the M-hopefuls who flunked
 90 the test) .
 91      Best of all, though, was MY reaction to their reactions. I meekly
 92 came crawling back to TGIF one Friday, after five years away.  After
 93 about ten minutes of sheer trepidation, I entered the hallowed meeting
 94 room, and said to myself, "Oh, you're really BRILLIANT, aren't you?
 95 What do you think you're going to find HERE? You didn't like it BEFORE
 96 when you... Wait! WOW!!! It's SYNCHRONICITY! With a capital frigin' S!
 97 Where has this guy BEEN all my life?" (Ever see an agnostic sport an "I
 98 found it! " bumper sticker?)
 99      And therein began my latest journey into the world of  timespace.
100 He's just over the 43.5 limit (so, what has math ever done for ME?) ,
101 he's not over 6', not tan, and is not one of those hairy types (ar-ar).
102 And he's BLONDE. So, did he read my ad?  Yes, and he said he wouldn't
103 have responded anyway "because you wouldn't have responded back if I
104 did." Now, THERE's a smart guy for you.
105      Yes, but what about the other 349 men, you ask? I'm afraid I'm just
106 too busy being  ecstatically synchronous with my re-definition of TDGCT.
107 Do I regret spending $112.70 to end up with someone I DIDN'T meet
108 through my WW ad? Not at all. In fact, the only regret I have these days
109 is that Jung couldn't be here to take notes.
110

112                       SYNCHRONICITY, ANYONE?

180                Excellent imagination...you should really try to write some
181                short story (edit it), then publish the damn thing...
182                "Lost Train to Jamaica" was keenly polished!!!
183  
184      {Rorschach} --
185                Hey, I'm on your EXACT frequency in life...
186                Yes.  There is a lot to do in this shifted world:
187                BUT, the question is "WHAT?"
188                I feel the same way you do about all this stuff,
189                and I have asked my self many questions in the past...
190                but have only found confusion and disappointment.
191                For example: my mortality, purpose, career, significant
192                other, children, rules...it all has one thing in common.
193                My FU*KING identity that I will have for the rest of 
194                this life (and possibly, other lifes to come).
195                I think it's a constant struggle to remain sane!!!
196                One thing that helps me understand REALITY is that
197                we have some-billion other people in this world trying
198                to do the same damn thing at our age.
199                Another thing is perspective: 
200                a lot of people in the world DO NOT have the same 
201                freedom we do...to better ourselves, and help others
202                better themselves (or, get through the tougher times
203                of REALITY).
204                So, at this time in my life (though I'm uncertain about
205                practically EVERYTHING), I'm giving my best shot at 
206                making honestly wise decisions concerning my next goal,
207                or move...because, the ONE thing I do know is that I can
208                continue to party and put-off certain things that will
209                help me later in life.
210                Sure, you can be hit by a car, tomorrow (and THAT would
211                SUCK), but the KEY-thing IS perspective.
212                Give it ALL a chance...and persevere...'cause it can
213                only end with "good" if you follow your own voice/heart.
214                That's where I am actually at so far, and it feels real
215                natural...LIKE I REALLY DO HAVE A GOAL/PURPOSE IN LIFE,
216                AND I'M ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

228  
229 Take my neighbor Ma Gilliam for instance.  To avoid running into the rather
230 typical situation (in THIS neighborhood anyway) or possibly not having
231 enough money fo property taxes some year and losing it all to some "friend"
232 of the neighborhood tax collector for the mere taxes, she went through
233 a Multnomah County program where you're exempt from taxes until you die 
234 and then it's taken out of your estate.  Wel, lo and beehold, what hap-
235 pens??? She gets slapped into a horribly noisy, degrading and EXPENSIVE
236 nursing home hortly thereafter and they STILL "sell" her property **AND**
237 belongings right out from under her.
238  
239 Needless to say, I was QUITE upset. In fact, I think the "estate" lady,
240 DELORES MARTINDALE (<-- she'still in the same b, who
241 was sent to descecrate te shring, got a restraining order aganst me ...
242 after I'd called about everybody in town for help wch was, of course,
243 the same brick wall it still is.  But then one of her "assistants" 
244 "Worked" for the police department, he vivulged lter, when he also con-
245 fessed he might tend to consider the whole operation rather corrupt,
246 along with some of Delores' OTHER sidelines.  And although most neighbors
247 ":turned theire other cheeck" at the time, some DID later concede the
248 whole things was unbelievably outrageious ESPECIALLY, I think, after
249 three of Ma's four lots "went" to a corrupt "favorite son" developer who,
250 if I have the "facts" straight, was largely "responsible" for that first
251 S&L failure in town and whose name, coincidentally, sounds too frighten-
252 iongly like DOMINION.
253  
254 Then as it ended up, the people in THOSE "project" houses were later
255 totally outraged to find they'd bought some fine print contracts declar-
256 ing they had no choice but to paya thru the nose for a road they didn't
257 want so another "favorite son" developer and his two-attorney neighbor-
258 hood deedholders could put THEIR chintzy Project in ... but THAT's a 
259 whole 'nother Book.
260  
261 About Ma, let's just sa she was quite a character. She came from a wealthy
262 "horse" family in Salem (which was burned out by the IWW, she once said),
263 CLAIMED she got her RN from Columbia in New York, had TWO shackfuls of
264 priceless antiques left over from her (and his) "previous" lives, and
265 she absolutely LOVED to tell me stories ... which I LOED to hear.  And
266 she knew EVERTHING that was ging down (and HAD) in the neighborhoodl, 
267 like alot of the other old ladies around here --- even what flocks of
268 birds were passing through.  She and her husband (I never met him) used 
269 to manage some kind of fishing lodge or something she always referred to
270 as Three Creeks, and when she and I would go places someone ALWAYS
271 recgnized her from having been there.  Even the guy who used to give me
272 a ride to work knew of her or theplace, whichever, which I thought was a
273 real coincidence.
274  
275 Delores, on the other hand, was the wife of a bank VP and probably 60-
276 something ... a bleached blonde with skin-tight designer jeans and back-
277 less spiked heels, all of which seemed so silly when she had to wade
278 thru Ma's knee-high hay to get to the house in order to sort thru Ma's
279 most prized possessions (including her letters and photos, which were
280 merely thrown into a dumpster) ... then out to supervise her rather
281 extensive trucking crews in their removal of all the "garbage" that was
282 stuffed to the gills in her even-larger U-shaped outshack(s).  And
283 Delores always brought along her rather bizarre 20-something yo daughter
284 too, who was always outfitted really retro (WITH white gloves, no les,
285 which she'd wear the whole day) who'd simply sit by Ma's stove and
286 crystal lamp all day and play with her "simple Simon" toy <- I kid you
287 not.  I think the chick even talked babytalk.
288  
289 But to top it all off, "friends of the Bank/Mult. Co./Delores/Whomever"
290 antique dealers statewide then had first shot at what was left of the
291 loot Delores hadn't hauled off.  There were hordes of 'em that spent 
292 the night in their cars all up and down our street so's to get frist 
293 grabs on what was left.  Ma's place was lit like a Christmas tree all
294 night long I suppose so nobody would do anything "stupid," so I bet
295 neither Delores didn't sleep all night long either.
296  
297 I don't know how soon after They all did That to her it was that Ma
298 died.

315  
316   The City of Portland miring in decay and decadence?  I think the owner
317 of that opine doth complain too much.  I've been in places that are
318 currently Hell on Earth compared to dear old pdx, and I'd take pdx over
319 SeaTac, SanSan, ChiPitts...BosWash, that one goes without saying.
320  
321   But maybe tossing about the names of the megalopoli are are little too
322 arrogant.  OK.  Given.  I've seen many places, but let me clue you on a 
323 little thing about little towns close by.  To be grindingly exact, Corvallis.
324  
325   Corvallis is a wonderful little place.  Healthy.  Calm, despite the Geeks
326 who go to OhEssYou.  They even have free (but for how long is anybody's 
327 guess) unix Internet sites (don't write 'em and ask; I was a system
328 administrator down there and they're letting locals only on these days).
329  
330   You could live quite well in Corvallis.  But there is no decent place
331 to have coffee in the wee-hours, for one thing.  The only 24-hour place
332 is the Lyon's, and it just isn't Q.P., if you get my drift.  
333  
334   But then again, what is?  But I hope you get my point.
335  
336   For a city it's little size, it's darn sophisticated.  Best coffee in that
337 section of the world.  But it just isn't the place a confirmed urban can
338 really enjoy life in unless you already have the bux.  The nourishment
339 of the soul just isn't there.
340  
341   Other places might be peaceful and nice.  But then, so's certain forms
342 of medication.
343

375 &*&*&*&*'s
376 Justin, I first logged in on July 6th of 1988.  I believe I missed your era
377 by a fairly short margin.  I've been hanging around here ever since.  I agree
378 with what you say about Portland.  It ain't perfect, but it has a lot going for
379 it.  
380  
381 I spent all of my pre college days in towns of 50000 or less, with 11000 being
382 the size of The Dalles, where I graduated from HS.  It only took me a month
383 or two to figure out that Portland was nirvana in comparison.  Powells, record
384 stores, shopping malls, libraries, BBS's, education etc.  I don't think
385 I could settle for anything less.  So, when people around here go on balistic
386 whines, I start to wonder about their motivations.  Do they have the slightest
387 clue as to how things work elsewhere?  It doesn't seem that way.
388  
389 Portland ain't perfect, but what is?  We've got a fairly decent thing going 
390 here.  I'm not saying it couldn't be better, I'm not saying its perfect.  But
391 any faults it does have tend to be way short of the typical problems you'll 
392 find in a city of this size.  Blame people, not power, not money.  If they
393 want to find the enemy, they only have to look in the mirror.  
394  
395 We are the enemy.  As long as we focus in on others exclusivly, whe don't stand
396 a chance of improving the big picture.  Who here hasn't been touched by greed
397 and coruption?  Who here hasn't participated atleast once?  Who here has never
398 lied or cheated?  Who here has never treated another unjustly?  We are all 
399 responsible to one degree or another.  
400  
401 The world can be a better place.  We must start with ourselves, and work our
402 way outward.  It is counterproductive to try to fix the world when we ourselves
403 are broken.  Without inner piece, there can be no lasting change.  Anger is
404 a negative emotion.  Violence at best brings about the illusion of change.
405 Underneth the surface the old pains and hatreds will still seth.
406  
407 Yet humanity seems anxious to try these dysfunctional solutions.  Will we
408 ever evolve beyond the stick and muscle diplomacy that still hides barely
409 beneath the surface of so much that happnes in the modern world?
410  
411 Or are we destined to be one of natures failures?  Not even a footnote
412 in the history of the universe?  I just don't know.  But with each passing
413 year, I move closer to the conclusion that we will in fact fail.  If I am
414 around when it happens, I will feel no joy, being right about such an
415 ending would be at best a no win situation.
416  
417 But it doesn't have to end that way.  There is so much potential in we the
418 human race.  There is beauty and genius in all of us.  If we do not shut
419 them off.  If we do not deny them.  If we do not take the path that leads
420 only to self gratification.

427 Astral
428 :
429 Your friendly welcome made me think that maybe I had known you before
430 when I was a pdx'er.  You see, I've made high friends in low places....
431 they come out of the woodwork from time to time.
432  
433 Back in '88, just before I left for Corvallis, my then-girlfriend now-wife
434 Britt helped initiate the oft-misspelled "Boarder" wars.  Of course, I can
435 see you know, in a limited way, the advantage of having a finder-tag-string
436 in your posts here.  I've noticed that the use of full borders has fallen
437 off here, but back then, that was how you opened and closed your entries
438 if you wanted to be separated from the great ASCII horde.
439  
440 The Border Wars of 1988 primarily consisted of "This is my Boarder!  No it
441 isn't I had it first!  Yes it is, I was posting here before I was born
442 and I have blood samples to prove it...."
443  
444 I was foolish enough to mention that it wasn't a "Boarder", but a "Border"
445 war that was going on.  I was promptly ascii-dogpiled on and learnt my
446 lesson.  Nuff said.
447  
448  
449 In your reminisicence of why pdx is not as bad as they say and just
450 aout better than anyplace else, I realized that the concern I had
451 really didn't go that deep...though our thoughts along the sentimental
452 line were valid enough.  The thing that gets me is that most pdx.whiners
453 just seem to need something to whine about.  They really seem to need
454 to see somthing wrong...as though what was wrong wasn't bad enough...
455 it's not good enough that the city's on the banks of the Styx, it's that
456 it's across the river from Hell...that sort of thing.  It's not bad enough
457 that it can't be worse.
458  
459 My mother in law's that way.  She has a house in McMinnville that is 
460 in below average shape, and that's all she knows.  Can't blame hre
461 for it, but it gets to the extreme when she comes to our new neighborhood
462 and sees all the wonderful architecture in Brooklyn (you know, around 
463 Powell Blvd and Milwaukie Ave) and admires the houses, but can't look
464 at them beyond how much work there would be in maintaining them.
465  
466 Each is magnificent.  A magnificent job of work.  
467  
468 I'm rambling.  I'll go on later.

534 Not that I ever WOULD consider it, but I already had the guy's number
535 anyway.  See, some years earlier I'd had some Trouble with the Revenew's
536 kid Ceaselessly taunting my dog so that one fine day, while I was engaged
537 in a phone conversation, she happened to bolt out of the house after this
538 kid which, of course, resulted in a messy tangle and the kid ended up with
539 atiny cut on his l. most probably from his own braces.  I wasn't
540 any too concerned about it until Ma informed me there might ben to
541 be,  lived t 30-40 years previou and KNOWING about
542 such thing.  And sure enough, not only did "the police" show up to
543 question me about possible chickenpoop "assault" charges (IF you can
544 imagine???), but they Ceaselessly "patrolled" my house for weeks after-
545 ward.  Evidently Ma had also notice 'cause she told me to call down and
546 tell the department that a brother of my neighbor down the street was
547 harassing me ... with city equint an their time.  ~'{Ma'd Ma'd told me it was p
548 [D

550 probably the guy who lived dowon by Fred Meyer who'd always kept his patrol
551 car right there in his driveway who was related to this Mr. Day who lived 
552 right down from us (and UP from the Revenewer).  So I checked it out and
553 sure enough ... and nwhen I called 'em down at the department they just
554 kinda chuckled and said they'd look into it.  But the "patrolling" DID stop.
555  
556 Now I ask myself, with all this fine local police assistance available
557 right here, HOW could it be that there is STILL so much **REAL** crime in
558 the neighborhood???  I hope poor Al Brown wasn't picked on all this time
559 for being the same calibre of criminal I'm apparently considered to be.
560  
561 Or should I say maybe I hope he was???  It's so confusing.

566 Excellent article.  And very typical of the BS at PPS, as WE ALL KNOW.
567 I think it's interesting also that there is a VIRGINIA MC ELROY down 
568 the School of Education at PSU who is in charge of placing student 
569 teachers at PPS I included this in my extensve report to the Board of
570 Education, which I have confirmation in writing that Mr. RIeke and Mr.
571 Kafourey have read.  I originally submitted it to Carol Turner, but she
572 wouldn't neither send me a written reply, as requested, OR return my
573 phone calls.  I sent the report because they refused to grant me the
574 "executive" meeting they USED to have when "personnel matters" were
575 involved.  I see tEd Schmidt is not heading Personnel.  Homany
576 henchmen positions has he held over the last 10 years anyway.  Seems
577 like he's somewhere new every year or so.
578  
579 But it's funny, the bizarre problems I had at PPS (other than with Don's
580 FORMER secretary who was finally Given a department of he own) was with
581 the wife of the Asst. Dean of Education at PSU ... who DOES hiring of
582 the adjunct types, I believe.  Tightknit bunch, huh?
583  
584 But isn't it funny too how few teachers felt free to respond when the
585 guy was obviously totally obnoxious??? (that's not a criticism ...
586 teachers already have it bad enough already)

592   As long as we are pontificating on REAL problems that need solving,
593 did anybody read that one in The Oregonian about those impoverished souls
594 at a SE Division area (I think) apartment complex?  They're kicking everyong
595 there out after just a month after the place changing owners.
596  
597   It's front page news.  The agent for these folx needs a PR lesson, bad.
598 He said the single mothers and poor people who live there are "just lazy"
599 and he "didn't believe" that it cost somebody $750-1000 to get into another
600 apartment.  I'd like to backhand him one.  This apartment we are in right
601 now is nothing if not modest...moderate rent, too....over $800 to move in,
602 counting the pet deposit.
603  
604   What got me is that the company (a California one, wouldn't you know?)
605 sent all the tenants a note of greeting and a bottle of Champagne last
606 month when the complex was bought.  These are the kind of people
607 that give all landlords a very bad name.

621 I moved a couple of months back.  Total cost, $975 for the first month I only
622 had to come up with $775 right of the bat though.  Talk about painfull.  It'll
623 be the end of febuary before I really recover.  And this was for a decent sized
624 one bedroom apartment in an older building downtown.  Of th $575 move in cost,
625 $400 is refundable when I move out.  
626  
627 And this is one of the cheaper places to live in the DT area.  They keep 
628 buildin these upscale apartment buildings.  The city give the developers a
629 10 year break on property takes.  One bedroom apartments cost about $750
630 a month in most of these places.  What a deal eh?  And we all pay that little
631 extra to make up for the loss, while the tenants pay thru the nose as well.

720   Catching up on current pdx events, I saw the story someone mentioned here
721 about Dan Klee in Willy Week.  God, what an unmitigated slime.  And he
722 got away with it, too!
723   One of the reasons I want to make a lot of money is so I can send
724 my kids (if we have them, if in pdx) to private schools.  PPS are poor
725 excuses for learning.  My little sister started in them, and was doing 
726 badly 'till she moved to Stayton.  Stayton has many drawbacks, but one
727 of them is NOT having schools that don't give a darn.
728  
729   More on the Landlords from Hell:  the agent for RSVP Management (a
730 Burlingame, CA, business), one David Maxwell, recived a lot of hate
731 'phone calls that morning.  He said he'd help by getting in touch
732 with social service agencies.  In the meantime, wonderful folx from around
733 the pdx have offered help in the form of money or help finding places to
734 live.  Bless them.
735  
736   The thing that made me angry about this so=called gent?  In evaluating
737 the tenant's situation, he mentioned that they should "get off thier lazy
738 butts"; and The Oregonian related that he "didn't believe" that it cost
739 $800-$1000 to get into A Place Of Your Own.
740  
741   What a royal ass.  I hope his little slips of the lip cost him his job
742 and his rent.  Be about right, I figure....
743  
744   On the #19-Woodstock, crossing the Ross Is. Bridge, I saw a single
745 Christmas boat alight on the Willy, under the Marquam Bridge.  An
746 early starter, no doubt (it was only about 6:00pm, and the Fleet
747 generally doesn't sail 'till around 7:00).
748  
749   Remember: pray for the little guy.  You never know when you might
750 become him.

758 All is quiet here, getting a little stressed about how far behind I am in

760 I'm starting to miss Ms Nomer, she's been gone for about what 7 months now?
761 Haven't heard a word, I hope she's happy in England.  I hope she comes back
762 home sometime.  The last time I saw her was in my driveway, she was driving
763 her little white rabbit and had her boyfriend with her.  That's when  she
764 gave us the news.  I was stunned, I don't do well when I'm stunned. And then 
765 she was done/gone.  Oh well, Merry Christmas Kristy.  Have started going to
766 a health club to try and beat the holiday excesses before they start.  It's 
767 an atempt anyway.  I don't have anything exciting to write a story about,
768 now that is sad.  I could make a comment about the Kennedy trial, ok let's 
769 do that.  I'm glad that he got off.  I'm  also sad for the "girl", but 
770 hey, now she can make a mint off the mini series.  Only in America.  Ok,
771 on to world politics.  I read in the Oregonian (what a joke) today while
772 riding the lifecycle that "US offica\ials believe power is shifting to
773 Yetsin"  NO KIDDING?/!  I can't believe some of the trash in the paper.
774 Ok, so the USSR is no more, now we can look forward to all kinds of civil
775 war s in these new nations.  I can't even bear (sp) to think of what kind
776 of money this will cost us when we rush into each dispute to "save democracy"..
777 Bah. Well, that's enough mindless typing.  I think I'll sit down and write

780  Although I've never MET Ron Hanlon, I remember being shocked by
781 the rantings of a fellow secretary about how unbelievably cruel he'd been
782 to here ane had a horrible shock.  I was shocked
783  ed quiteith his wife ...who is, evidently, a long-term good friend of Eleanor 
784 Hardt, whose husband probably hired Dan Klee.
785  
786 Also interesting is that the current Union rep refused to work for Eleanor
787 although she only had about three other people she worked with when the
788 only other secretary in the department had about 10 people she worked for.
789 Eleanor had her desk in Avis' room, but Helen had d

826   Freeways on Bull Mountain?  Could the scribe who mentioned that be a 
827 tad more exact?  Freeways are certain things, and only certain roads with
828 certain features can be considered freeways.
829   Unless, of course, you are very angry. 
830   The person who wrote the development complaint was interesting...but
831 incoherent.  No, semicoherent.  The person writing about something being
832 "exacth Bevanged thin", as "TAG will surely know"?   There seemed to be
833 some parity problem here.  It seemed interesting...I sure would like to know
834 exactly what it was about.
835   
836   Why doesn't KATU investigate?  Well, how about KGW or KOIN...or even
837 KPTV (Lars Larson would do an awesome job)?  The complaint was a a little
838 confusing.  
839  
840   One of the ways that news such as this gets to ANY news organization
841 is for citizens just like you and me to call them or write.  And don't 
842 stop at television...go to radio and the newspapers.  I bet someone
843 like Phil Stanford or Steve Duin at the Big O would give it a listen at
844 least.  Or, if they don't get to it, try radio...surely somebody at
845 KBOO would like to get thier teeth into it.
846  
847   Don't be disappointed if the "big" broadcasting folx don't slaver at
848 the bit, though.  The only source of revenue for TV, (most) radio, and
849 newspapers is advertising.  Advertisers have to be pleased with them.
850 Also there are the folx who view TV and the paper as nothing more than
851 entertainment...they don't want to be challenged, and won't be pleased if
852 thier TV is taken up with a lot of serious news.
853  
854   Media has to please everyone.  They don't.  Any wonder?
855  
856   And if the media prove fruitless in getting the word out, do it yourself.
857 Just because there's no money behind you...did someone take away your 
858 mouth?  Posting here was the first step.  Get on your typewriter and
859 get to the xerox machine and take it to the streets if you have to.
860  
861   Don't make the excuse that you're just one voice either.  That's copping
862 out.  Greater things have been started on a single voice, going on 
863 until nobody could ignore it anymore.
864  
865   Rambling about social responsiblility, now.  Hmm.  I guess it comes down
866 to this; if it's important, it's important enough to yell about.  Don't
867 blame the media.  If something isn't out there and it needs to be seen,
868 then get it out there where it CAN be seen.  Don't wait 'round for someone
869 else to do the dirty work.
870  
871   If nobody else will, it's your turn.

891  Good boy, Rorschach.  The homeless have it bad enough without little
892 twits like those harassing them.  I would have done the same thing if I
893 were in your situation.
894  
895  It's not a sign of the city's decay, though.  If it were, then the
896 homeless and people like you saw would only exist in pdx.  They are almost
897 everywhere.
898  
899  The reason that people are like that is becuase for more than ten years
900 now we have had leadership that have said grand things while all the while
901 giving a tacit okay to derision and contempt for the less fortunate.  These
902 days, not having money is a social crime that people are despised for.  The
903 Reagans and the Bush's, and those like them who have driven events having
904 to do with however much money you and me and others get to lead our lives,
905 have sold the vast flocks of sheep that elect them on the premise that one
906 is poor and homeless because They Want To Be.  Nobody assumed that the
907 homeless were homeless by choice until the Reaganites came along.
908  
909  Actually, it's not so bad here.  What you saw was despicable, but it was 
910 near the kinder end of the spectrum.  It's worse elsewhere.
911  
912  Not to excuse the fact that it happens here, of course.  It should not happen
913 anywhere.  But we'll have derision of the extremely poor as long as we
914 have leaders who love the rich and keep themselves in power by turning
915 fellow citizen on fellow citizen.

923  
924 But it's still there.
925  
926 More and more the city hides it's welts and bruises.  They are out there.  I
927 have seen the blood in the gutters.  I can walk by, and see it still.  Even
928 after it's been washed away.  It's still there, just hidden.
929  
930 The city beautifies itself by covering up it's rotting core.  Why cant they see
931 that the city is a whole.  Not just a succession of mayors or the top 20 riches
932 of the last 10 years.  It is a whole from the richest person to the lowliest
