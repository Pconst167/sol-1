27  An observation,
28 
29   While visiting family & friends yesterday the enevitable topic of
30 T-D-A often came up for discussion. These people and the ones I have
31 spoken to since the broadcast seem to fall into distinct categorys.
32 the 12- 30 year olds seem to care intensly what is occuring 
33 in the nuclear sphere. The 30-45 seem mildly curious to indiffrent.
34 The 45-60 seem altogether complacent with the current state of affairs
35 And 60 + seem to favor the nuclear option as a means to control Soviet
36 expansion ..
37 
38  Have any of patrons of this fair inn had a similar observation ??
39 
40 erhaps only the young should advise ?
41 
42 On a lighter note,
43 Who amongst us will decide the time & place for the rendevous ??
44 I think each comment on this disk should be prefaced with a 
45            << time >>
46                and
47            <<place >>
48 and on a subsequent  disc we can all argue the merits of each. For
49 now just get some  !! INPUT !!

59                      HELP NEEDED FILE    Jim Carr
60     I know a little Basic annd not much else so these questions
61    may display my lack of experience.
62          
63 .  I was supplied with both MSDOS and CP/M86 when I purchased
64 Columbia Data Products MPC. I started using MSDOS right away.
65  now have to keep separate cpm formatted copies of all my
66 ftware if I want to experiment with CP/M86?
67 What are the benefits of CPM over MSDOS and vice-versa?
68  I purchased a hi res rgb color monitor with my system, thinking
69 hat I would be able to use it as amber or green or any color
70 l. I now find, much to my disgust that the colors on the
71 een are totally under the control of the particular software
72 am in use at the time-mostly in B&W monochrome and written
73 n assembler or something that I can`t alter. I can control
74 olors from basica only and these commands are overridden as
75 soon as I return to SYSTEM. Is there any way that I can add to
76 modify my operating system or any program I can write in basic
77 h will give me color control. Can't you fool the system
78 elling it that "black = blue" or something? This really irritates
79 I do not find B&W to be either attractive or restful. Help!
80 4.  My Basica Manual is entitled "Microsoft GWBasic/Basica".
81 What is GWBasic?  My MSDOS diskette contains a program called 
82  BASIC86. What is BASIC86?
83  How can I use Basic to call and run programs (basic and otherwise)
84 a disk?
85  How can I cause MSDOS to list a file directly to the printer?
86   I received the wordprocessor PERFECT WRITER with my system.
87  using it with a Gemini 10 printer to try and produce Gemini's
88 oportional character ROM set" in boldface (emphasize) or
89 blestrike mode. The use of this character set seems to disable
90  the other print features which are supposed to be "nestible",
91  won't nest in conjunction with this character set.
92   How can I send Control Codes to my Gemini outside of going to
93 y wordprocessor?
94 .  I understand that the characters on my keyboard have ASCII
95 ues other than the literal. Where would I look to find a
96 e of these values? If CTRL A = 1 then what = 0? Can fractional
97 ues be expressed? (1.5,2.6,etc)

119 I hate to tell you folks this, but Carl Sagan is NOT a good example of a
120 scientist who lets his scientific judgement override his ambitions & 
121 emotions. As an example, his "nuclear winter" hypothesis has been more
122 or less discredited in testimony before congress (about 2 weeks ago). He
123 was assuming a number of non-factual conditions. For instance, ALL the 
124 blasts were assumed to be 20 megaton ground bursts, in reality the 
125 average warhead is considerably smaller (say 200-500 kiloton).
126 Also he is depending on a "threshold effect" for which there is NO 
127 evidence. Not only would this effect have to exist, it would have
128 to involve a truly fantastic discontinuity. (I am NOT saying it
129 is impossible,
130 just not very damn likely).
131 A couple of disks back someone said that Portland had a 20-meg warhead 
132 targeted on it. I seriously doubt that, we more likely have 2-3 warheads
133 in the 100-500 kiloton range targeted. I also take SERIOUS exception to 
134 the radius of effect he gave. A 20-megaton blast has only TEN times
135 the radius of effect of a 20-kiloton blast (square-cube law). If anyone 
136 is really interested, I can recomend some books.......
137 My only real objection to "The Day After" is that they assumed that
138 NO ONE had ANY idea of what to do after the bombs start falling.
139 There are quite a few people who would know what to do. They could have 
140 shown at least ONE family that had a PREVIOUSLY PREPARED AND STOCKED
141 fallout shelter, & knew what else needed to be done.
142 I feel that no matter WHERE you stand on the nuclear arms question, you
143 should be able to realize that we are going to need to know what to do 
144 before, during, & after a nuclear strike. Disarmament is a great idea,
145 but until there are NO nuclear weapons (& no chance of any being
146 produced), anyone who ignores such things is a fool. I will gladly
147 answer questions about such things, or at least try to suggest sources
148 for answers. (yes, I know this kind of discussion makes people 
149 uncomfortable, but consideration of the results of NOT knowing
150 these things should make you even MORE uncomfortable!)

204 Leonard:
205 It isn't quite true that a 20Mton bomb would have a radius of effect 
206 ten times that of a 20 Kton bomb.  First, since the level of electromagnetic radiation decreases based on the inverse-
207 square law, the radius of effect is greater by a factor of 31, not 10.  Second, the amount of radioactive material generated
208 might be equally different, resulting in a different radius of effect.  All in all, I'd say the inverse-square law will hold
209 for most effects.
210 For an interesting study of missile against silo probabilities, see the most recent Scientific American.  This
211 article points out that the likelihood of actually destroying a silo is not well known.

214 To Jody, see you tomorrow. Bon soir!

216 Re: Nukes. I would tend to agree with leonard's estimation of what might
217 be targeted at Portland. Even with one 20 meg warhead hitting us, the entire
218 area might not be obliterated to the Soviets satisfaction. 2 or 3 lesser
219 warheads aimed at more strategic locations could certainly do a better job.
220 What is this about the Nuclear Winter theory being rebuked? That would be
221 calling some very prominent scientists, who happen to agree with Sagen on
222 this point, wrong. Sure not every blast will be a ground blast, infact,
223 from my understanding, a large percentage of warheads are set for high
224 altitude airburst. Of course no one knows the threshold point either, but
225 I believe the scientists threshold was a starting point. Just like every
226 theory has a starting point somewhere. The nuclear winter appeals to the
227 common sense in alot of people. It is not outlandish to believe such a
228 thing could not happen. I would certainly change my mind if I were presented
229 with better arguments against the theory than for it. Anyone have anything
230 besides un-quoted magazine articles(and Rolling Stone does not count!)
231 What about it leonard? If you are going to shoot holes in Nuclear Winter,
232 you better be prepared to defend your accusations. I will look for your next

255 Leonard, One thing you forgot to mention, is that airborne atomic bombs
256 are not exploded on impact, another aspect that Sagan was using in his
257 figures. An Atomic bomb is an electronicly controled device it can not
258 take an impact and function properly. As such they are designed to
259 explode in the air not on impact. Typically this is several hundred yards
260 to about 1/4 mile. Also, Anon; I might point out that the effects of hte
261 bomb are quite varied. They depend largly on the prevalent conditions.
262 If there are clouds, the lay of the land, the wind direction and speed
263 (both lower and upper atmosphere). The various effect componets will
264 be effected differently. Clouds will inhibit radioactive fallout from
265 reaching the upper attmosphere, While mountains and large structures
266 will impead the progress of any blast wave as well as the electromagnectic
267 and light flash. Also, while the United States does prefer the smaller
268 bombs (100-500KT) because they are more reliable, and are easier to
269 control, the Russians still tend towards the larger type bombs 
270 (10-50MT). This is largely because they are not as adept at bomb making
271 and so the designs tend to be a bit cruder. As such they go for the 
272 big bombs 'just to be sure'. However, most of the bombs that both sides
273 have pointing all over Europe are of the smaller class. (50MT bombs
274 aren't exactly portable). Russia has built a 100MT bomb, but it is
275 rather wastfull of material. It seems that a good portion of the 
276 active bomb material is destroyed before it has time to become an
277 active part of the explosion. Oh yes, Atomic bombs don't explode
278 instantly they take up to 10 milliseconds to reach critical point.
279 (Depending on size of bomb). Also, Anon/Leonard you are right, several
280 small bombs are far more effective then one big bomb. Even the military
281 knows this, they use the big bombs more for 'effect' then work. Which
282 is why they are called strategic weapons. While the smaller ones are
283 called tactical weapons. The tactical weapons are intended to do the 
284 real work of destroying things.

286 the users can become more enlightened.

346 Mike, It would seem Orwell missed.
347 As to Sagan for president; he is a populiser for science, and good at it,
348 but would he be good at running the country? I fear that truth isn't what
349 most people want to hear, but rather they only want to hear the good side.
350 I am also disturbed by the common refences to "the government", rather than
351 to the individual described (he may work for the government, but he isn't
352 it.)

376 There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold. And she's
377 buying a stairway to Heaven. And when she gets there she knows
378 if the stores are all closed. With a word she can get what she
379 came for.
380 
381 There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure. Cause you
382 know sometimes words have two meanings. In a tree by the brook
383 there's a songbird who sings sometimes. All of our thoughts 
384 are misgiven.
385 
386 There's a feeling I get when I look to the west. And my spirit
387 is crying for leaving. In my thoughts I have seen rings of 
388 rings of smoke through the trees. And the voices of those who
389 stand looking.
390 
391 And its whispered that soon if we all call the tune. Then the
392 piper will lead us to reason. And a new day will dawn for those
393 who stand long. And the forests will echo with laughter.
394 
395 And it makes me wonder.
396 
397 If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now. Its
398 just a sping clean for the May-queen. Yes there are two paths
399 yu can go by. But in the long run. There's still time to change
400 the road you're on.
401 
402 You head is humming and it won't go - in case you don't know.
403 The piper's calling you to join him. Dear lady can you hear
404 the wind blow. And did you know your stairway lies on the
405 whispering wind.
406 
407        And as we wind on down the road-
408        Our shadows taller than our soul-
409        There walks a lady we all know-
410        Who shines white light and wants to show-
411        How everything still turns to gold-
412        And if you listen very hard.....
413        The tune will come to you at last-
414        When all are one and one is all-
415        To be a rock and not a roll.

431 Anon:  The main effects of ANY large explosion are from the BLAST
432 WAVE. This is a VOLUME effect, not a SURFACE AREA effect. Thus it follows
433 the square cube law NOT the inverse square. If you check a table of nuclear 
434 weapon effects (see any of several military manuals <unclassified!>
435 or reports on various tests) & you will see that the effect area
436 for a 20 meg is 100 times that for a 20 kil, the radius (of the crater or 
437 any other effect) is 10 times greater.
438 Luke:  I don't have hard copy of the info. I am relying on a VERBAL report 
439 of testimony before congress on or about 11 November of this year. If 
440 someone wants to check thru the Congressional Record, I would like to know
441 the specifics myself (my hours do NOT allow for extensive library searching)
442 ALL:  I must point out that a scientist's opinions aren't worth any more
443 than yours or mine IF he is speaking OUTSIDE HIS AREA OF EXPERTISE! Also
444 please note that I am merely saying that there are others who have grave
445 doubts about the probability of the "Nuclear Winter". We can't be sure it is
446 possible (or impossible) and we would be foolish to assume that the Soviets 
447 will give it serious consideration. They might, BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T?!
448 On another subject from a few disks back, I regret to inform you that the 
449 WICKED, AWFUL bombings of Hiroshima & Nagasaki SAVED lives! At the time we 
450 only had THREE nuclear devices & it would have taken MONTHS to build another
451 Thus the "make a demonstration shot" scenario wasn't possible. The only 
452 other alternative was to invade Japan. Conservative estimates place the
453 number of causualties in the neighborhood of 2 million Japanese & 1 million 
454 American. 
455 The same msg seemed to imply that public opinion in the Soviet Union 
456 matters. I suggest that this person read what former citizens of the USSR
457 have to say about what happens to anyone who dares to speak out against
458 current government policies. Some people don't seem to realize that the 
459 majority of their citizens don't even know about the invasion of Afghanistan
460 (they do know about the US invasion of Grenada). Most of them didn't realize
461 that the plane that was shoot down a few months back was an airliner. The
462 announcements that mentioned the airliner didn't say anything about it being
463 shot down, the announcement that "a plane" violating Soviet airspace had
464 been shot down came about a week later. With this kind of "news" reporting I
465 doubt that Soviet citizens have any REAL idea what is going on in the world.
466 In the USSR 1984 is HERE! A traveler discovered that according to THEIR
467 history books, Lithuania & Latvia have ALWAYS been part of the USSR. Funny, 
468 OUR history books say that they were "annexed" after WWII.
469 (one final note regarding the KGB: in wartime KGB battalions follow the
470 front line troops & shoot anyone who retreats or DOESN'T ADVANCE FAST ENOUGH
471  This is "standard" policy!)

473 Leonard:
474 What is the 'square cube law' of which you speak?  Never heard of it.  But
475 anyway, it may have been a 'soft error,' but did you really mean 100 when you typed the following line?:
476 
477 436 for a 20 meg is 100 times that for a 20 kil, the radius (of the crater or 
478 ny other effect) is 10 times greater.
479 
480 I include in my estimates the effects of fire, in addition to the blast.  And while you may not consider fire to be
481 one of the 'main effects' of a bomb,  I'll bet that far more damage could be caused by fire than the blast itself in
482 a city or suburbs.  Wanna try an experiment?

487   Speaking of nuclear wars, A friend and I took a hike up on
488 Larch mountain. Strangely enough, we came across a big round
489 hole in the ground, a gate around it and 4 guards at the
490 corners of the gates. We walked up to them, and asked:
491 "What is the purpose of this hole in the ground and why are you
492 guarding it?"
493 His reply:
494 "Go home kid... your mother wants you."
495 I said:
496 "It looks like a missile silo if I do say so myself."
497 He said:
498 "Keep to this yourself, and don't spread it around or I'll have
499 to do something about it. No GO!"
500 We left there... So, I have reason to believe that there is
501 a missile silo up on larch mountain. You MAY not believe me,
502 but i'm
503 suggesting that there is something worth checking out if you are
504 ever in the area....
505 
506 To ELECTRIC EYE:
507   Yes, I'm interested in LASER DISK technology... it's really
508 neat how they did the switching with 1 computer and 4, uh,
509 pardon the pun, disk drives. Lay questions on me and I'll lay
510 questions on you and we can discuss it, okay?

514           IN CASE OF NUCLEAR WAR EVERYONE CAN
519           COME TO MY HOUSE WHERE IT WILL BE SAFE.
520           NOW, PERHAPS, WE MIGHT DISCUSS SOMETHING
521           DIFFERENT.

536 Regarding the nuclear war issue, one might read "World War III, August 1985"
537 and its sequel "World War III, The True Story", both are by a former NATO
538 general and explore what would happen if the Soviets invaded Europe.
539 It mentions the KGB battalions that Leonard discussed.  Interesting
540 reading, no matter your stance on nuclear weapons.  After reading those
541 books, I would have to conclude that unilateral disarmament would be
542 suicidal.  But then again I really doubt the Russians are willing to
543 disarm in any case.

551 To Jody,
552      Alas a last we have meet. Our meeting was indeed brief, but enjoyable.
553 You are truly the rocker your messages have painted. Tell me more about
554 the 'Blue Ice' you spoke of. It's late so I must depart. More later...
555                                     Bon voyage en France

557 PS To nukers...I too have read the 1st WWIII book. It is fascinating reading
558 The descriptions are very real. The author's backgrounds make the books
559 what they are. They KNOW what they are talking about. I recommend them
560 to any one interested in this subject. Robert Ludlum would be proud!

564 Luke:Blue Ice is a band that originates in the Oregon City-Mollala area. 
565 The guys from the band are friends of mine (they miht also be called 'blue 
566 eyes'). They play all over the Portland area but mostly at Harry's Moustache
567 in Oregon City. Thats where most of the members of the band work for thier 
568 other jobs. They are a great rock and roll band but not the best I've seen. 
569 I will have to explain more later when I have more time. Ask me some more 
570 specific questions.    Later days 'Luke',
571       P.S. Didn't I tell you that if the trivia question was about V.H. I 
572 would get it. And I did!

577 There are two science fiction books that I am aware of regarding our 
578 current discussion.  One is Alas Babylon, by Pat Frank, and presents
579 what I consider to be a much too rosy picture of the future.  This
580 one I recommend for a positive note.  The other is Level 7, and I 
581 cannot remember the author's name (help me someone, please).  It 
582 paints a picture that I feel is probably the closest to reality
583 of any I have seen. (With a few minor technical errors, and perhaps a 
584 couple of sociological ones)  I recommend it to all world leaders.
585 
586 For our other topics, I like BAD's suggestion of place, although
587 the H.I. place sounds OK too.  I would like to change my time vote 
588 to 1800 on the 16th of December. ???

599 At present ,video-disc technology is the most fascinating 
600 field of computers for me.Have you heard of any other applications  
601 besides games?
602 
603 
604 also,what do you think the appeal of a disc game with real actors would be?

615      WELL, FOLKS, WE NOW ARRIVE AT THE END OF ANOTHER DISK.  MY ENTRIES ON
616 THIS PARTICULAR DISK HAVEN'T BEEN MANY (COME TO THINK OF IT, I DON'T THINK
617 I ENTERED ANYTHING ON THIS DISK!), BUT I GUESS I GET TO HAVE THE LAST ONE.
618 I KNOW THAT VERY FEW WILL READ THIS, AS NOBODY SEEMS TO USE THE END OF THE
619 B DISK BEFORE USING THE NEW DISK ON DRIVE A.  I GET VERY NERVOUS SOMETIMES,
620 THINKING THAT I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT IS ENTERED, SO I
621 FEEL THAT I MUST FILL THE REMAINDER OF THE DISK IN.  AS THOSE THAT KNOW
622 MY STYLE WILL REALIZE, I AM RAMBLING IN ORDER TO FILL SPACE.
623 
624      I AM REALLY BORED WITH THE CURRENT DISCUSSION ON DISK A (NUCLEAR
625 WAR), AND I WAS HOPING TO REDIRECT OUR DEBATE TOWARD SOME OTHER SUBJECT,
626 SUCH AS CENSORSHIP.  I OBVIOUSLY WASN'T SUCCESSFUL, SO I GUESS I WILL
627 JUST BE A "LURKER" UNTIL SOME SUBJECT COMES UP I WANT TO COMMENT ON.
