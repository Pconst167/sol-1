 51 Well, it looks like we lost the message base that we had here such as it was.
 52 It isn't completely lost, only that for somereaon it isn't compatible to
 53 this new version. I don't know why, there shouldn't be any reason for
 54 a difference. Oh well, It is still available since I saved a copy of the
 55 old disk. I'll put it in with the next archive release. 
 56 Speaking of which, should we include headers in the archives, or not?
 57 Also, could someone work on making the archive command work?
 58 Downloading is not the best way to handle this I did it to try to
 59 find out why the old data wasn't compatible with the new, and it
 60 took forever. I'm a bit worried about the non-compatiblity problem.
 61 When I tried to do enter it blew up with a run-time error of 91
 62 (read past end of file). Any ideas?
 63 There are still some minor logic errors in the system in regard to 
 64 timeout and hangup that I have to work on. I did modify this Sanyo
 65 to not take so long accesssing the disk drive (only one second instead of 
 66 two seconds). And it has the hardware mod to make the motor stay on
 67 on demand, but the code hasn't been implimented yet.
 68 But at least you can hack away at what we have so far and see how it works
 69 and find the bugs that we haven't fixed yet.

 77 It's in the Write_dummy_header procedure when it tries to do a seek,
 78 it says it is seeking past the end of the file. Specifically it is the
 79 SEEK(sessionfile, thismsg); statement, which means either that the
 80 "thismsg variable got damaged someplace, or that there is a problem with
 81 "sessionfile".

 93 Leonard:  Try the obvious.  The first four letters of the "Password: " 
 94 prompt.  (Hint, hint :-})  The word is easy to change, and it should be before
 95 BWII's debut.
 96 Mike:  The only thing I can suggest is to look at everything that modifies
 97 Thismsg... a lot of ground.  I can only say that everything I've got does not
 98 blow up, at least, not yet  :-).
 99 Leonard again:  I just checked SE 1, SE 2, SE 3.  The reason you're getting
100 the same line for SE 2 and SE 3 is because you were stuck at level 0 and 
101 session 3 has been deleted (so you can't see it).  SE (and related commands)
102 don't produce an error message when you try this, but rather look for a 
103 session that you *can* look at.  This doesn't happen unless all of the lines 
104 of a session are deleted.

115 I haven't done anything to it!  One possiblity is if Leonard hung up on the
116 system, or did a control C while it was trying to close things up, it might
117 have aborted the procedure and not do a proper BYE. Then if you called in
118 before the system timed out, you might have gotten in on Leonards sesson.
119 Which reminds me guys, don't do ^C's to get out of here, just type BYE, it

142 (It said 859 lines remaining.  Oh boy oh boy oh boy.)
143 DaveO: Headers are visible at level 4.  Currently, BWII is set up to do the
144 most necessary functions, so it might be put up while we work on bigger and
145 better things.  The way permissions work right now is this:
146 Level 0: All allowed permissions only on text entered during the current
147 session.
148 Level 4: All allowed.
149 LEVEL affects CH, DE, RE, UN, and whether headers are visible.
150 If something illegal is tried (such as editing the top 19 lines at level 0)
151 you get messages like 'CHANGE NOT ALLOWED' and 'DELETE NOT ALLOWED'.
152 Last I heard, Mikey was working on some of the modem routines, speeding up
153 drive access, and thinking about how to implement 1200 detect on the Sanyo.
154 Other than an almost inexplicable problem with write_dummy_header (a
155 procedure used by ENter), the code is holding together well.

162 of the modem stuff, I think I have a handle on the 1200 control now,
163 it will require a new RS232 board. Which means rewritting the INT14

171 Milchar: We need to get together to get this enter/session/disk I/O
172 mess cleaned up. I've been going over the code and doing some clean up
173 on it, but I'm running into areas where I'm not sure what you are doing.
174 So rather than making some follish mistakes, I think it might be better
175 if we got together and did an intensive edit session.
176 Another point to consider, I've looked at what has evolved, and with
177 the implimentation of full header files, I think it might be better
178 if we change the way the headers are handled. specifically, that the
179 position of the header within the header file matches the line number
180 where it is associated rather than the current build from top down
181 mess. I suspect that it will clean things up a bit. Thsi should make 
182 killign lines a little easier since we won't have to move anything,
183 only reassign it. This puts the load fully on the link file to maintain
184 everything. But since it already keeps track of the session headers
185 I don't see a problem here. Any comments?

189 Ah yes, taxes.  I owe The State $489 this year.  As if I had such bounty to 
190 toss carelessly about.
191     You know, I'm not the worlds fastest typist, but BWMS II seems to lag a bit
192 behind, and even drop a character now and then.  Not good, eh?

194 ************************************************
195 Yes, it is a problem, the character dropping occurs at the start of the line
196 every six lines or so as the disk access occurs. It is also sluggish because
197 it is sitting behind BW I, therefor it has another set of UARTs to go through
198 which causes an additional delay. Thus when you type a character, it goes out
199 your UART, and gets collected by the BW I UART (33ms), then BW I sends it
200 on to BWII through another set of UARTs (another 33ms). BWII processes it,
201 and echos it out its UART back to BW I (another 33ms) BW I picks it up and 
202 echos it on to you (yet another 33ms). This isn't counting the time over the
203 wires of course. And since the Uarts involved for most of this are 8251's,
204 and I know that from a standing start they add an additional 1.5 bit time
205 delay (standing start is what we are normally dealing with in manual typing).
206 We are talking 38ms at each of those levels. so we have a total harware delay
207 of 38x4, or 142ms. Lets add another 8ms of transmission delay (probably a 
208 little more than that, but its close enough), and we have about 150ms echo
209 time from when you hit the key until you see it on your screen. Well over a
210 tenth of a second, and definitely noticable. This is compared to talking
211 only to BW I where we can eliminate two of those 38ms delays. Which knocks
212 us back down to around 80ms, which is well under one tenth of a second, not
213 so noticable, and something we are used to, whereas the 150ms delay we are 
214 not used to, and so is noticable as "different". The end result of all this
215 is that when BWII makes its debut it will be back at the echo speed you are
216 more used to, and of course at 1200 baud even more so!

224 of the link file stuff... (SIDE NOTE: To educate those of you in the audience

232 Hmmm, yet another missing header....
233 I apparrently left it just before Milchar signed on. I had typed BYE and
234 it did it's thing, and returned to the command prompt. I suspect that it has
235 something to do with returning to the system via timeout that is the differnce
236 Normally you should see the message "WELCOME TO BWMS II etc... when you 
237 enter here. If you don't get that message, if all you get is the "Command:"
238 prompt please let me know. Then we can corelate that with the missing header
239 problem and maybe findout where it is. 
240 Milchar: Do you think it might have something to do with a buffer problem?
241 not closing the file or flushing the disk buffer properly?
242 The problem would have to be in the link file since that is where we 
243 find out if the line has a header attached to it.

263 Harumph.  IF bye is called, *all* of the linkfile junk is written out.  The
264 linkfiles are read into memory once, at login.  There doesn't seem to be much
265 room for problems there.
266 The most important variable to check for this condition is 
267 'bottomptr[currentdrive]'.  It must contain the bottom line number of the disk
268 *before* a person logs in.  ENter checks to see if the lines being entered are
269 below this pointer.  If so, then it thinks that this is part of the same
270 session, and tacks more data on the last header line.  If not, then it goes
271 ahead and writes a new dummy header for the new session.
272 One good code-tightening session we need to arrange.  Are there any suggestions
273 for the time/place?

299 ok, yet another version is implimented. Give it a shot.
300 If you type a control C at the first line it still blows up on you 
301 in enter though, this is because I haven't installed the new data
302 file with full lines preentered. I didn't want to loose this data
303 file just yet, so we will have to live with that bug for a bit.

349 Actually, LI does it too. It appears to be th first command that you enter
350 after someone else uses the system that causes the problem. For now, all
351 you can do is wait for it to come back. I'm working on it.
352 Jim Michaels bought an old Diskwriter from Joe Bartel. And apparently
353 now has a manual. You missed all the fun of a few weeks back when he was
354 trying to "upgrade" BW to the lastest EPROMs for the Diskwriter.

471 acceptable as many of the other authors.
472 Note that he has yet to drag anyone else into the story. Or to try to 
473 "tag along". He appears to be approaching either the Friar or the Philosopher.

481 plans by choosing an set that don't match his intentions.

484 some from of gravity (or are you just floating? If not, what are you *standing*
485 on? :-)
486 I guess I'm trying to say that it sounds like an unfinished "pocket universe".

491 The door universe... well, first there isn't anything like air, ground,
492 or water. There is nothing except what has been explicitly defined so far.
493 It is an empty universe that is in the process of being defined. 
494 I myself was only a conciensness (sp?) at first, and my being and existance
495 is being defined as the universe is defined around me. The universe
496 is BWII. As BWII evolves so does the universe. Not materially and directly,
497 but my own interaction to it. Since I'm not yet fully sure of the direction
498 of the evolution, my best suggestion owuld be to stay away from trying
499 to attribute any developement to it, but rather treat it as an unknown.
500 The "window" and the effort involved to create it is that which has
501 gone into the program, and the window itself is simply the means for 
502 getting here behind the door. It has required all of us to get the code to 
503 a position that it could be put here, and I have pretty much defined
504 this door as it is, prior to this the door was there, but was simply
505 another room (though locked) off of the Inn. I kept my private CPM system
506 there for my own use which is where the CPM part of the command comes from.
507 But when BWII needed a home, I displaced the CPM system with this one.
508 At first there was no BWII here, but only the ideas This was the beginning
509 and as things continued, slowly it began to evolve as did my perceptions.
510 My intentions for the whole thing is to open the door in an explosion of
511 light and glory upon the fateful day, and the world of the Inn will become
512 engulfed and replaced by a new Inn universe derived from the one in the 
513 making here. I don't think people would take too kindly to the Inn being
514 destroyed and gone (including me) but the very structure and fabric of the
515 universe of the Inn will be torn assunder and a new Inn universe will be
516 rebuilt around the new universe. If you have to relate it to an SF story,
517 I guess the closest I can think of would be Triumph of Time (or Cities in
518 Flight for those who have the all-in-one trilogy) though it is a poor
519 analogy. The pocket universe bit is not even remotely close. 
520 The entry I just put up will be the last one for this week, I don't have
521 anything else in waiting to enter, it was really ment as a mechanism for 
522 the others in the group to get into the story.
523 The best approach that fits in the way I've been going would be an attempt 
524 by the group to get me out from behind the door without disturbing the door
525 itself since the is the (real) distinct danger that it would destroy the
526 Inn should it be opened. So any attempt must be to get me out without opening
527 the door. But what will happen in the final attempt is that the door will
528 be opened anyway despite the efforts to prevent the action, and the new
529 universe will come into play. That's about the best story plot I can
530 muster up at this point.

534 Time that the truth be known.  My name?  It's known anly as that of
535 the art I practice openly.  What do I do?  I toss words about with a
536 bit of care, hopefully, and a fragment of a story appears.  If the
537 fragments work well I go on to another in the patchwork that might
538 make a story.  Before I disappeared I was trying to do this with an-
539 other with somewhat the same views as mine.  Many felt that the one
540 I was writing with was merely a facet that existed in my mind... an
541 alter-ego for pen's sake.  Not so.
542 What's this, you caught me plying my words, eh?  Yes, quite right;
543 there are other arts I practice that are not common knowledge.  At
544 the moment arts is actually a singular activity, but enough of that,
545 let me explain something else a bit further.  This art may simply
546 be called the reading of cards.  They are several in number, but that
547 is a different story to be told at a later date.  One of them depitcs
548 The Magician, before him lay the symbols of life and existance...  He
549 manipulates, controls these powers. At least he attempts to do so.
550 For quite some time I have been impressed by the presence of this
551 being.  He exiss in several forms, yet all were not not known to me.
552 Still, all are not known, yet a few more faces have made my
553 aquaintance.  When once I met a french lady I came to know another of
554 the faces of these Magicians...  She pointed to me.
555 French ones do not refer to him as The Magician, rather he is called
556 The Juggler.  I found this most amusing.  In a way I still do.
557 It has crossed my mind to "allow the cards to fall where they may"
558 and incorporate its meaning, somehow, into the flow of a story...
559 hopefully one with a pre-conceived goal in mind.
560 This Door seems frightfully difficult to play with in such a manner.
561 If I may find my writing companion once again, perhaps we might
562 venture in another direction.
563 I tend to feign from the Magus aspect as there are far too many of
564 them wandering about at present.  Milchar, you are doing very well.
565 Now I think it's about time I figure on another plot.
566 If the gods are with me, perhaps I'll be able to bring one of them

586 keyboard (rm *).
587 As for the effect of opening the door, I recall a short story from the 40's or
588 50's that involved a lady shoplifter kept stuffing aluminum items into her 
589 purse. When store security looked, they weren't there. seems it was a gate of
590 sorts. After a bit we have a tug-of-war going between our universe and the
591 other end of the gate. If either end 'wins' it is liable to turn the other
592 universe inside-out. 
593 (NOW I remember the title!! "Tiger by the tail" by Alan E. Nourse(?))
594 If the door opens, the universe would 'turn inside out' thru it. Sort of like
595 the topology bit about turning an innertube inside out thru the hole for the 
596 valve. In theory you can do it. In practice, you wind up with shredded rubber.
597 Hows that sound?

600 TR is truncate.  What's XR?
601 And now I've got to get back to figuring out how to incorporate that "pale &
602 week" voyeur into the story.

605 We haven't missplaced the insert command, we know exactly where it is:
606 Unimplimented.
607 TR is truncate, XR is recover. In Milchar's case, he lost the connection
608 which caused his entire entry to not get saved. But since it was on disk,
609 all he really needed to do was to let BW know that it was there, so he
610 used the XR command which recovers *all* lines on the disk, then used 
611 the truncate command to eliminate those below his last line.
612 Leonard: actually, the Triumph of Time (Cities in Flight) by James Blish
613 is a better description of things, though as I said, it is still different.
614 There it was an anti-universe that was colliding with our universe,
615 which caused them both to be destroyed. Our heros then used that very
616 destruction to carry themselves through to the creation time of the 
617 new universe enviornment so that they could create their own universes.
618 (Who says you can't be God? :-) Of course in the process of creating
619 the new universes they had to use the only material at hand, their own
620 bodies. Thus it required self-destruction to create the new universes.
621  isn't the case here, here it is more of a case of two universes merging
622 together, leaving the old ones behind and creating an whole new one
623 incorporating aspects of them both plus new aspects all rolled into
624 (hopefully) a bigger and better universe. Many aspects will probably change
625 because of this, and many other apsects will remain the same. One thing
626 is certain, it will go out with a bang, and many things will change.

628 I remembered the destruction of the two universes. I had forgotten the creation
629 bit...
630 
631 A rather standard, but useful 'plot device' might be to post a 'montage' of
632 impressions/sensations/effects/events from the viewpoints of all our characters
633 at the moment "it" happens. This won't advance the story much, nor is it
634 appropriate until the "end of the world". It will, however, help get across the
635 idea that things are *different*. And perhaps *how* they are different.
636 It doesn't have much bearing on the current state of the story, but I thought 
637 I'd mention it so that we'd have time to work it out. 
638 Milch and apprentice get to detail any "obvious" magical effects. Bard for
639 "tech", etc... plus lots of "what's going on?"stuff????
