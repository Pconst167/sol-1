67 Aaron:
68 I know just a slight smattering of the subjects you (drunkenly) brought up,
69 but not enough to be able to help.... just enough to admire your bravery in attempting to ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH somethin'!
70 You might find a recent article in HIGH TECHNOLOGY magazine fascinating: Optical computing.  A real mind-blower if there
71 ever was one.  Imagine doing a 1-million point FFT in 3 nanoseconds or so!  (just take a 35mm picture).
72     Perhaps you could alleviate some withdrawl symptoms with saccharin?
73 
74 All:
75 Let's hear some commentary on our little war in Grenada, garden spot of the Caribbean.  Should we be there
76 (not us personally, just our young'uns), and for how long.  Reagan has unwittingly provided a marvelous new subject for
77 us to pick apart in teeny-tiny detail.
78 I think they oughtta search the island for a cork labelled 'inflate here', evacuate the island and pull out
79 the cork. PPPPPHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
80 Splash!
81 Seriously, what are we doing in Grenada?  Let's hear from the peanut gallery.
82 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Anon :::::::::::::::
83 
84 I think being in Grenada is a good idea. The peoples lives on the island will be a lot better under a democracy rather
85 than a communist dictatorship. Except for the marines, the fighting force was all volunteer, so don't anyone go 
86 screaming about American lives being lost. Most if not all the soldiers there are in the military to fight. It also is
87 good training for the troops. I believe the Ranger drop was the first major combat jump since WWII. I also might point
88 out that the neighboring islands requested U.S. assistance. I know I'm going to get crucified for my views by all the
89 liberals out there, so take your shot, I have to go and watch the end of the A-Team.

93   i think that the best way to avoid the withdrawl symptomology is with
94  more of the same brew. i try to reserve it for moments that i need to
95  function irrespective of the relative discomfort; i wonder how I convinced
96  myself that BW at 4am fit that criteria........
97 
98   Optical, eh? well, unfortunatly my applications demand perfect accuracy
99  (precision?); SAW or Optical techniques just aren't going to cut it. If
100  Gallium Arsnide toys were availiable i would leap at the thought of using
101  them, yet unfortunatly ECL seems to be the only viable solution at the
102  moment...damn the speed/power product though! ....maybe if someone could
103  just come out with a EICO kit called "josephson devices: basic experiments"
104  I would consider that technology......

111      AARON, WE DON'T NEED MORMONS CRYING TO BE LET OUT AS THEY CAN LEAVE ANY
112 TIME THEY WANT TO, OR WILL BE KICKED OUT IF THEY COMPLAIN TOO LOUDLY (I.E.
113 THE WOMEN THAT HAVE TRIED TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM OF TOTALLY MALE ELDERS).
114 BESIDES, SINCE THEY CAN LEAVE AT ANY TIME, MOST CAN AND DO IF (IF!) THEY COME
115 TO A CONCLUSION THAT THE CHURCH IS FALSE.  BUT WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
116 WAS AN ENTIRE WORLD SOCIAL STRUCTURE BASED UPON THIS SYSTEM, WASN'T IT?  I
117 HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT MORMONISM FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO LIVE THAT LIFE, 
118 BUT A WORLD BASED UPON IT ISN'T MY IDEA OF UTOPIA.  ALSO, SINCE THERE ARE 
119 OTHER MODES OF LIFE AVAILABLE, SOMEONE LEAVING THE MORMON CHURCH IS ALREADY
120 AWARE THAT HIS/HER CONCEPTS AREN'T ACCEPTED AS TRUTH BY OTHERS, SO IT
121 WOULDN'T COME AS SUCH A GREAT SHOCK.  BUT IF THE ENTIRE WORLD IS BASED ON 
122 SUCH A SYSTEM, THE SHOCK WOULD BE HUGE. BESIDES, I WAS POINTING OUT THAT
123 THE 90%/99% SOLUTION YOU WERE ADVANCING WOULDN'T STAY AT THOSE FIGURES FOR
124 LONG, AS MORE AND MORE REALIZED THAT THE TRUTHS OF THE CHURCH WEREN'T TRUTH.
125 IF SOMEONE COULD COME UP WITH A SOCIAL STRUCTURE THAT WOULD SOLVE 90% OF
126 THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS FOR 99% OF ITS POPULATION AS YOU PUT FORTH, I WOULD
127 ACCEPT IT GLADLY.  I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THE MORMON CHURCH IS IT,
128 ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN THAT BELIEVE THERE ARE THINGS IN LIFE OTHER THAN 
129 SERVING ONE'S MAN, KEEPING HIS HOME, AND BIRTHING HIS BABIES.
130 
131      AARON, I'M SORRY THAT LAST BIT LOOKS SO EMOTIONAL.  EXCUSE, PLEASE?
132                                                                            
133      ON THE QUESTION OF GRENADA, IT WAS COMMENTED THAT IT WILL BE GREAT
134 FOR THE PEOPLE THERE WHEN WE INSTALL A TRUE DEMOCRACY.  WELL, IF WE INSTALL
135 A DEMOCRACY, IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE DONE IT TO A COUNTRY WE HAVE
136 INVADED SINCE WWII. USUALLY, WE REPLACE A DICTATOR THAT IS OUR ENEMY WITH 
137 A DICTATOR THAT IS OUR FRIEND.  I WOULDN'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO DEFEND ANY OF THE
138 TYRANTS WE HAVE OVERTHROWN, BUT I DON'T SEE THAT WE HAVE DONE MUCH TO 
139 IMPROVE THE LOT OF THE PEOPLE OF THOSE COUNTRIES AFTER WITH OUR OWN DICTATOR.
140 I DO THINK THAT REAGAN IS TOO QUICK TO SEND IN THE TROOPS, AND HE IS DOING
141 EXACTLY WHAT HE ALWAYS SAID HE WOULD DO WHEN HE WAS GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA
142 (AT LEAST HE WAS TOTALLY HONEST).  EVEN MARGARET THATCHER, NOT KNOWN AS A 
143 PARAGON OF LIBERALISM, SAID TODAY THAT SHE THOUGHT THE INVASION WAS "ILL-
144 ADVISED".  I JUST HOPE HE DOESN'T GET US INTO PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEYOND THE
145 SCOPE OF HIS ABILITIES TO HANDLE, AND AT THE RATE HE IS GOING, IT MAY HAPPEN.

151 Mikey:  Thank you for directing me to M II.  Why I was unable to find it
152 last night is beyond me.  (My sugar consumption is minimal>  Aaron sug-
153 gested the possibility of obtaining copies of archived BW disks, which
154 approximates a suggestion I have considered making (when I have less than
155 ten other responses pending).  Have you ever considered publishing BW
156 in hardcopy form?  Perhaps something of the nature of an unedited "yearbook"
157 would be of minimal cost to ready for publishing; or an alternative 
158 (although more costly) would be an edited book of BW "hilights" spanning
159 the years of its existence.  I think the market for such an item would
160 extend not only to BW'ers, but also to users of other systems, researchers
161 in abnormal psychology, material seeking comedians, microtheologians, and
162 perhaps even the general public.
163      I have recently taken to recording a copy of those messages of per-
164 sons who seem to have frequent "identity crisis" relapses (and forget who
165 said what) but there are many other messages which would like to have a
166 hard copy of, were it a little more convenient.
167 
168 Leonard:  Sorry, in my last response I forgot to mention an important point.
169 You stated something to the effect that I should not interfere with someones
170 beliefs as long as those beliefs pose a threat to society (something like
171 that).  I did address the question of whether or not education constitutes
172 interference, but what I forgot to menton was the most curious aspect of
173 that statement.  You either missed or chose to ignore the main point of my
174 argument which was that some of those beliefs, particularly the one that
175 allows them to avert any feelings of guilt resulting from moral trans-
176 gression by simply praying for forgiveness, are very much a threat to 
177 society.
178 
179 Dave:  Why do we deny the existence of a god?  I suspect that my answer
180 reflects, for the most part, that of other atheists; I have simply found
181 no reason to believe that it does exist, but I have found considerable
182 reason to believe that belief in a deity is a misconception.  I have tried
183 to outline some of those reasons in previous messages.
184      With regard to your second question, the potential oppressive nature
185 of any such organization, whether atheistic, deistic or even motivated
186 by a completely different parameter, such as politics, is why I have long
187 avoided such organization.  Recently though, I have considered that the
188 oppressive element might be eliminated by limiting the basic binding con-
189 cepts of the organization.  Opression, among other things is a product of
190 hypocrisy; therefore, the theory is that by making a single statement as
191 to a common belief of the members, such as "We believe that deities exist
192 only in the human mind, not in reality", and avoiding lengthy dogma which
193 rigorously defines every aspect of the members' conciousness, the members
194 will not be required to profess a number of principles which are contrary
195 to the basic nature of their being, or experiences, and hypocrisy will be
196 thusly avoided.
197     With regard to the third question, I believe that in the long-run, truth
198 will offer the most peaceful and humane (politeness is practitioner-defined)
199 solution to the problems of humankind.  Since I am strongly of the belief
200 indicated in the above quotes, to state otherwise would be a manifestation
201 of the type of hypocrisy which I am attempting to avert.

218 Grenada had a legitimate democracy before Maurice Bishop came to power
219 How do you think he got elected? It was only after A coup take place in
220 which Bishop was executed and a radical marxist seized power, that the 
221 U.S. (with the request of the O.E.C.S, organization of eastern caribean 
222 states) decided to act. The claim that American lives were in danger, 
223 while not the main reason also contributed to the decision. Except for 
224 Cuba and Haiti, I can't think of any other dictatorships in that area.
225 *********************dss*****************
226 
227 DOM: I can't figure out why my comments elicited your response. In any case,
228 I don't remember ever having such a silly belief regarding the
229 sky. I also don't see how you can justify your statements. There
230 is a considerable difference between educating a child & "eliminating 
231 Christianity" (or any other religion). The essential tenets of
232 most religions are not subject to proof, thus your "analogy"
233 falls apart. Also, if you start with Christianity, where are you
234 going to stop? Perhaps when anyone who disagrees with you has been
235 "eliminated"? I made a point of stating that beliefs that are
236 counter to the way the world works, will soon (VERY SOON) show
237 their shortcomings. 
238 In case you haven't figured it out yet, while I feel kids
239 deserve better treatment than they generally get, I don't think
240 they should have "full adult rights".  This is another reason why
241 your analogy is "invalid".
242 PAM:  You (and others) seem to be ignorant of certain facts regarding
243 the "public" airwaves. The FCC "grants title" to frequencies &
244 (with the exception of AM broadcast radio, FM broadcast radio,
245 & TV channels 2-83) IT IS ILLEGAL TO MAKE ANY USE OF A TRANSMISSION
246 NOT DIRECTED AT YOU! They specifically mention "commercial use"
247 among other things. Since HBO is charging for the reception of their signal,
248 I believe the courts would rule that you were making "commercial
249 use" of it.
250 This may not be "right", but it IS the LAW. 
251 
252 Finally, someone on the last disk was getting morality & ethics confused!

334      To answer your question regarding the identity of Deborah, no, DOM,
335 but our entrance together is no coincidence--she is my guest.  
336      'Monster Comics', indeed, Aaron!  Whatever your source is, it paints
337 up a gaudy, glittery tramp of a dragon, complete with haughty demeanor
338 and sinister coils--truly, I am injured that you would associate me with
339 such an unfriendly and chintzy figure!  Though my name was bestowed upon
340 me, I refuse to accept a borrowed reputation, even if it has the flash of
341 glamour attached to it, and I might even denounce it, if an image such as
342 you depicted is conjured in most minds--!  Pah!
343      I yield the floor to Deborah, but only because time presses--please

348 In regard to airwave piracy, all radio and television frequency holders
349 must support their broadcasting in some way or manner.  Most choose 
350 commercial advertising, (much to our chagrin).  But in the case of these
351 specialty channels, they offer movies without the constant irritation
352 and annoyance caused by most commercial interruptions.  Therefore, some of
353 their monies must come from other sources, like a user fee.  They are
354 providing a specific service, and we all are willing to pay for certain
355 special services that we want, so........what's the problem.  I do feel
356 tho that if someone just happens to pick it up because of other equipment
357 or location, not specifically directed at their frequency, that they
358 should not be required to pay.
359 Also, about the existance of a God.  Consider:  a businessman who was
360 asked why he believed in God explained that in his factory it takes two
361 days for a girl to learn how to put the 17 parts of a meat chopper together.
362 "I am merely a plain manufacturer of cutlery," he said.  "But this I do 
363 know, that you can shake the 17 parts of a meat chopper around in a wash-
364 tub for the next 17 billion years and you'll never have a meat chopper."
365 I realize this is an overly simplified illustration but it does touch on
366 a very complicated science, that of probabilities which I will employ
367 another time in reference to a creator.  If someone approached a person
368 and informed them that their house had evolved or come into being on its
369 own, most would retaliate, PREPOSTEROUS!  Here I go, quoting from my
370 favorite source:
371    "Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but he that
372 constructed all things is God."  (Hebrews 3:4)
373 Most object to the idea of creation because they rightly say that six
374 24-hour days is not enough time to accomplish the bringing about of a
375 universe.  But the Bible is a book about God, his dealings with men
376 and his ideas; and most of it is on his timetable.  In fact, the whole
377 Genesis account is only about his work having to do with just the earth.
378 Any-hey the days of creation amounted to 42,000 years not six 24-hour
379 days.  Plenty of time to develop a planet.  Therefore, don't you think
380 a belief in God is worth considering?

396 On the subject of Grenada:
397      Even more interesting than the question of what we are doing there
398 is the question of just what the Soviets were doing there....
399 
400      We may have done what we did at exactly the best time, just befor that
401 very long runway was made active.  (by the way, why was the soviet embas-
402 sador the equivelent of a four-star general?)  
403      I'm going to reserve judgement on this until I learn more

408 WELL NOW!
409 REAGAN USED TO ONLY HAVE UNSUCESSFUL WARS TO TALK ABOUT. SINCE THE WEEKEND,
410 HE'S JUST ABOUT A MILLION PERCENT MORE POPULAR WITH ALL THOSE CONSERVATIVES
411 WHO WERE ON THE WAY TO BEING ALIENTED.
412 
413 SOMEBODY TELL ME: IF WE'RE SO CONCERNED WITH SPREADING DEMOCRACY THROUGHOUT
414 THE WORLD WHY DON'T WE INVADE EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA, AND SO FORTH. 
415 
416 AT LEAST I CAN APPROVE OF THIS MORE THAN THE TROOPS IN LEBANON ON THE FOLLOW-
417 ING BASIS:
418    1. WE CAN BEAT A COUNTRY OF 100 THOUSAND PEOPLE
419    2. WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING THERE - TAKING OVER
420 
421 WHAT BEATS ME IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT EXCUSES FOR THE INVASION ARE THE
422 THINNEST YET. SEEMS LIKE RECENT GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA IS ONLY AIMED AT 
423 IMPRESSING THE BELOW-80 IQ SET. IF I WAS TOLD WE INVADED IT TO SET UP
424 OUR OWN MILITARY BASE INSTEAD OF THE RUSSIANS, I WOULD BELIEVE IT.
425 
426 I FIGURE THE GRENADANS WILL BE BETTER OFF, AT LEAST. ASSUMING WE REALLY
427 RE-INSTITUTE THE DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION. BUT I MAINTAIN THAT WE WOULD
428 HAVE LIBERATED MORE PEOPLE FROM TERROR BY INVADING EL SALVADOR.
429 
430 INCIDENTALLY, HAS IT EVER BEEN DISCUSSED HERE THAT **ALL** MILITARY
431 DICTATORSHIPS ARE REALLY *SOCIALIST* TOTALITARIAN STATES!  REALLY. TALK
432 ABOUT TOTAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF THE ECONOMY. REMEMBER THAT THE
433 NAZIS WERE THE NATIONAL *SOCIALISTS*. SO LETS JUST CALL THOSE RIGHT WING
434 DEATH SQUADS IN CENTRAL AMERICA COMMIES AND GO GET 'EM. WE COULD TAKE OVER
435 THE WHOLE AREA, JUST LIKE IN TEDDY R'S DAY. FUN FUN FUN.
436 
437 AND THEN WE COULD GET ARGENTINA. TOO BAD BRITS DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS TO BOMB
438 THEIR WEAPONS-GRADE REACTOR & BOMB FACILITY WHILE THEY WERE AT IT. BUT THERE
439 WERE TOO MANY GERMAN CITIZENS THERE, I GUESS. IT JUST MAKES ME NERVOUS
440 KNOWING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO SHELTERED ALL THEIR NAZI BUDDIES AFTER WWII
441 DOWN THERE ARE GONNA HAVE A NUCLEAR ARSENAL. LOOK OUT CHILE.
442 
443 BY THE WAY, DID YOU ALL KNOW THAT THE GOVERNMENT LISTENS TO ALL OVERSEAS 
444 PHONE CALLS? AND MANY KINDS OF COMPUTER DATA TRANSMISSIONS? EVER WONDER
445 IF THEY'RE LISTENING TO YOU? MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER REASON THAT THE 
446 PHONE CO WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR MODEM. I'M AFRAID A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THIS
447 BBS HAVE ILLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT'S LEGAL AND WHATS NOT, AS WELL AS WHO IN
448 GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY CARES WHATS LEGAL. HINT - THEY WILL DO AS THEY
449 PLEASE - AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT, LET ALONE BE ABLE TO STOP THEM.
450 SENATOR KENNEDY MAKES JOKES EVERY OTHER SPEACH ABOUT THE NSA,NSC, FBI
451 ETC TAPPING HIS PHONE. IF HE CAN'T STOP IT, WHAT CHANCE DO YOU HAVE?
452 
453 WELL, ENOUGH ALREADY

457 re: Grenada
458 Let me pose a question. If you were living in a country where a violent coup
459 had taken place and a radical communist government took over, would you want
460 to continue living like that or would you rather have the U.S. come in
461 and have free elections, so you would
462 at leastbe able to choose your own government. Nobody seems to care what the 
463 Granadians think.

466  
467 Leonard:  Are you deliberately twisting my argument or does your closed
468 mind allow you to read only what it wants you to read rather than what
469 I have written.  Also it is rather difficult for someone trained in logic
470 to respond to your messages which are largely if not totally devoid of 
471 logic.  I will again attempt to do so, however.  
472      Firstly, if you don't remember having such a belief regarding the sky,
473 I suspect that either you were an "unusual" child (which is not difficult
474 to believe) or that your memory is defective (which also seems a definite
475 possibility).  In any case, whether or not you had such a belief is not im-
476 portant.  The point I was attempting to illustrate by the analogy is.  
477 Also the fact that my example involves a child is not important; I could
478 have also cited an example regarding post graduate studies, but since 
479 the curriculum at this level is dependant on the major of the particular
480 student it would be much more difficult to find an example that all could
481 relate to.  The point is that the object of any education is to change
482 the students beliefs either by adding to them or by correcting misconcep-
483 tions.  You have stated that there is a conciderable difference between
484 education and eliminating christianity.  This is true.  I have never stated
485 otherwise.  It sounds as though you are trying to compare causes with 
486 effects.  In both the case of my example and the function of my pro-
487 posed atheist organization, the cause is education and the effect is the
488 elimination of ignorance.  You seem to think that though religions, since
489 the beginning of history, have attempted to promote and teach others their
490 beliefs (and thereby eliminate atheism) atheists have not the same right.
491      Perhaps there is a need for an atheist rights movement after all,
492 but I suspect that there are not too many who subscribe to your double 
493 standards.
494      Your statement "The essential tenets of most religions are not sub-
495 ject to proof" is amusing.  The only reason they have not been subject to
496 proof is that they are unprovable.  If they were provable, I assure you
497 that such proof would be widely publicized by the proponents of that re-
498 ligion.  Beyond this, I fail to see what this has to do with my analogy.
499      Allow me to answer your next questoion, "where are you going to stop?",
500 with a question.  If christians have their way, when will they stop trying
501 to "spread the word"?  Answer:  When everyone is a christian.  If someone
502 believes he has information that could greatly enhance someone elses life,
503 or that of society in general, and he does not make that information avail-
504 able, and make it well known that it is available, this does not say much
505 for his attitude toward humanity.
506 In your next question it appears that you are attempting to infer that
507 I am suggesting extermination of Christians.  I made it very clear that
508 this was not the case.  There is a big difference between eliminating 
509 christians and eliminating Christianity.  One refers to people while the
510 other refers to a set of archaic superstitions.
511      Your next statement I'm not quite sure how  to interpret.  Is this
512 supposed to be a prophecy of "the second coming"?  According to Masters &
513 Johnson its not likely.  Anyway, I predict that PEOPLE will show the
514 shortcomings of these beliefs, not the beliefs themselves.  Unfortunately,
515 when the shortcoming of a belief is shown by its proponents it is result-
516 ant of some disaster (war or whatever) which has arisen from that belief.
517 So if an opponent can demonstrate these shortcomings before the occurance
518 of such a disaster, I find that preferable.  
519      Your next paragraph I have already dealt with.  The fact that my 
520 example involved a child is irrelevant.
521  
522 Deborah:  Have you ever tried shaking 17 parts of a meat chopper in a wash
523 tub for 17 billion years?  In that length of time, damn near anything 
524 could happen, including the formation
525 of a complete meat chopper.  At any rate, noone here has suggested that
526 evolution involves random chance.  In fact, I have gone to great lengths
527 (before your arrival on BWMS) to indicate my disbelief in the existence
528 of such (random chance, that is).  Also, I think you suffer another misconcep-
529 tion regarding evolution.  It does not imply that anything has come into being
530 on its own.  Additionally, can we say that because houses are created, 
531 everything must be created.  This is eqivalent to saying "since grass 
532 is green, everything is green."
533      I think you are mistaking regarding the reason most people reject
534 the idea of creation.  If we were to accept the existance of such a super-
535 being, I see no reason to believe that he/she/it would not be able to create
536 a universe in six days, six minutes or six blinks of an eye.  I suspect that
537 some of your colleagues would lable you "heretic" for even suggesting that
538 he/she/it has such limitations.
539      My reason, and I believe the most common reason for discounting the 
540 existence of a deity is that there is insurmountable evidence in sup-
541 port of the evolutionary theory and virutually none whatsoever (at least
542 that I am aware of) in support of creatonism.  "d" has promised to pro-
543 vide me with such evidence, but as yet I have not seen it.
544      I also dispute your description of the bible.  It is not a book about
545 god, it is a collection of books, written by a number of ancients barely
546 "evolved" from cave dwellers, who had
547 none of the advantages we have today, such as scientific methods or equip-
548 ment or millenia of study, for ascertaining the nature of the universe; 
549 and it is about THEIR BELIEFS regarding god.  No doubt you will claim 
550 that they had the advantage of "divine enlightenment", but because this too
551 is self proclaimed by the writers, it is also an expression of their belief,
552 which is subject to the same disadvantages.  Moreover, we have no way 
553 of ascertaining which of those writers were even attempting to relate
554 factual material.  As far as we know there have always been fictional 
555 writers, as well as those who deliberately attempt to deceive the public.
556      As I mentioned before the time element does not really concern me,
557 but I think I should point out that what we are disputing is not the de-
558 velopment of a planet, but the creation of (as Carl would put it)
559 "billllllions and billllllions" of stars and planets and nebulae and 
560 quasars, pulsars, black holes, etc.  Or are you suggesting that these 
561 were created by some other gods?
562      Yes, I think belief in god is worth considering, and as I have
563 mentioned previously (ask "d" for details) I have spent a rather signif-
564 icant portion of my life in such consideration.  I feel I have given it
565 far more consideration than it is due.

572 DOM: I HATE TO TELL YOU, BUT IT SEEMS THAT GOD IS ALIVE AND WELL- HE'S LIVIN
573 IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND IS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE WORLD ACCORD
574 ING TO HIS PLAN.
575 I HAVE A QUESTION AS TO THE STUDENTS ON GRENADA: JUST WHY WERE THEY THERE?
576 COULD IT BE THAT THEY COULDN'T PASS THE ENTRANCE EXAMS HERE IN THE US? COULD
577 IT BE THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE BUYING THEM THE RIGHT TO PRACTICE MEDICINE?
578 FROM THE ONES THAT I HAVE SEEN EXPOUNDING THEIR FEAR OF THE SITUATION ON THE
579 ISLAND, I DON'T THINK I WOULD WANT TO TRUST MY HEALTH LET ALONE ANYTING ELSE
580 TO THOSE SPOILED PREPPY TYPES.

586 DOM: I *FINALLY* got you to clear up an ambiguity in YOUR statements.
587 Don't accuse me of reading things into statements that were not
588 what the sender intended. That is what your previous msg to me
589 was! I did NOT say you couldn't try to persuade someone to change
590 their beliefs. I said they had a right to differ with you (this
591 also implies the right to tell you to quit bugging them about it!)
592 As for my statement regarding unprovability, I meant EXACTLY that! In such
593 cases we are talking about SCIENTIFIC proof, *NOT* LOGICAL proof.
594 You are once again asserting that "since no one has proved it true,
595 it must be false"! And you accuse ME of being illogical? Also,
596 the bit about the kid has definite bearing. A "post-graduate student"
597 is an adult. In any case, I will concede the point. (by the way
598 it is getting VERY difficult to respond to you, you are raising
599 to many points at once)
600 I object to your establishing an organization for the avowed purpose
601 of getting rid of a religion. An "atheist rights" group, fine.
602 
603 As for your latest comment about d, I don't seem to remember her
604 statement quite the same way you do. She said nothing about "creationism" &
605 I'm not certain that she was going to "prove the existence of God" either.
606 Perhaps you should consider the fact that many of us are writing
607 these msgs as we go & not working from a prepared, polished text.
608 Thus, if we seem to be saying something you find indefensible
609 please consider the fact that we may have been attempting to say
610 something a bit TOO simply and thereby distorted our original meaning.
611 My original comments on beliefs & people's rights to have them
612 weren't intend the way you seem to be taking them. I cannot at
613 this time think of a way to express the thought involved without
614 you getting us even FARTHER afield. Beliefs may not be the right
615 word but it is the only one I can think of that fits. Why do you
616 always seem to descend to attacking my "qualifications" & style
617 instead of trying to find out what I "really" meant. We would get
618 a lot farther if instead of attacking, you were to say "surely you
619 don't mean X, could you possibly have meant Y? I realize that for
620 some this would take all the "fun" out of it, but surely you are
621 above that?
622 
623 C.Y.M:  6 months ago I and some friends were wondering what (if anything)
624 the US would do about the "Cuban base" being built on Grenada. I see that
625 Reagan waited for the LOCAL GOVERNMENTS to ask for US help. As for
626 Hey,Aaron!   This is Larry!   I finally got on this #$%& system... I read
627 your messages(dialogue?) earlier, and am very impressed with your colleagues
628 ideas. Please leave me a note...
