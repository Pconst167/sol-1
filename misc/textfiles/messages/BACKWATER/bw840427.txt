21 Milchar looks about, seeing an incredible sight before him.
22 Below him, on a great river, was a boat of an unknown type carrying passengers
23 with a one monster-power engine!!!
24 
25 Somewhat startled by this strange view he swept in closer, as he cast a spell
26 of Invisibility, to avoid the monster's notice.
27 
28 The great sea beast was talking to a strange little man and both were trying
29 their level best to get the other drunk, but it was clear that the monster was
30 winning.  Milchar sensed that this beast was something more thatn what was 
31 visible, so he continued watching.
32 
33 The great monster, the Bore, as much as told the strange man (called the Piper)
34 what the Arch-Mage had suspected all along.  'Hmmm...' said Milchar.
35 
36 'There's a waterfall ahead, and the beast shows no sign of slowing- maybe it
37 knows something we don't?????'

41   Hedra Helix, the handsome fighter, was walking about the streets of Idee when
42 he noticed another lady in distress.
43 
44   A very large man was trying to take all of her jewelry of her beautiful bosom.
45   Hedra then headed towards the woman to help her when suddenly, a very large
46 muscular man stepped in front of him.
47 
48   "Well now, it looks like I have a fight on my hands.", said Hedra.
49 
50   The large man draws his sword and rushes toward Hedra.  Hedra 
51 then draws his valiant sword, and swings it at the man.  The man atempts to
52 stop the sword, but to his suprise, his sword is broken in half.  Hedra then
53 swings his sword again, cuting off the mans head in his attempt.
54 
55   The other man then runs away after seeing the brawl.  Hedra then rushes over
56 to help the lady in distress.  She wraps her arms around Hedra, with a tight
57 squeeze.

84 Milchar - it is the Man in Gray who is to be absent for the next
85 two weeks, not Piper.  And I doubt that he would appreciate returning
86 to find his alter-ego abused and/or dead.
87 MIG - problems at home finally reached a head?

95   The piper stared entranced out the window.  Everything looked so small down
96 there.  The footing seemed so -- so -- Soft!  He found his gorge rising as
97 he seemed to become suddenly half his normal weight.  Clutching desperately
98 at the frame of the window, he suddenly felt extremely heavy.  The airborn
99 watercraft creaked alarmingly.
100   ##NOTHING TO BE ALARMED AT ... MERELY A LITTLE TURBULENCE!## sounded the 
101 voice in his mind.  
102   Looking back out the window, the piper could not help but wish that this 
103 strange voyage through the air would soon come to a peaceful end.

122 TO BILL CHARLES & ANDY;
123 I shall not apologize for myself or my thoughts on the religious issue. I am
124 however sorry that you feel that the subject is boring (Andy) and I am re-
125 sponsible only unto myself not to other athiests as they should be to themselves
126 , after all that is the whole point that I have been trying to make. I blame
127 none for my successes nor my mistakes, my actions are my own! If you feel guilt,
128 because of my stand (Bill) that is your problem, you shouldn't feel someone
129 elses guilt nor let their thoughts become your own. 
130 It is nice that you agree with my basic ideals but then you should form your
131 own opinions. My thoughts on this subject are Public Domain but that doesn't
132 mean that they may be interpeted at anyones will!!
133 Where o' where is DOM, he would surely understand.

138 The refference to Cecil the serpent was most obvious. I think the person
139 asking the question was simply asking a moot point, since they also
140 indicated the refference to the lovable monster re:"sick of 'C's?"

171 The superiority of Hamsters over Gerbils? What nonsense. 
172 Everyone who is anyone knows that Hamsters and Gerbils are 
173 effete urban panywaists. There isn't a real mouse among them. 
174 
175 Face it. Gerbils and Hamsters are over pampered, over- 
176 protected, and spoiled rotten. They don't find their own 
177 food, they don't make their own homes, and they can't even 
178 get laid unless a human (yuk) supplies them with a broad.
179 It's pretty pathetic if you ask me.
180 
181 What difference does it make who's better than who? Neither 
182 of you holds a candle to a real mouse.

188 Now that's what I call a topical, relevant, and profound 
189 philosophical debate. 
190 
191 What are the spiritual and philosophical ramification of the 
192 rodent in modern times? What are the sociological implications 
193 of the social stratification of fuzzy little animals? And, 
194 most importantly, what effect will the outcome of the 
195 discusson have on the role played by the rat fink in society. 
196 
197 This is heavy stuff. I can see we are on the cutting edge of 
198 a philosophical and moral renaissance.

210    The whistling wind around his ears and broad the expanse of river
211 valley at his feet made the practitioner happy to be alive. Not only was
212 the river cruise progressing beautifully, the lovely person PAM might be
213 waiting for them up river. It had been a wonderful adventure but it was
214 certainly time to move on to more enthralling company and conversation.
215 Now that the Inn had been tidied up, a round of drinks with friends old
216 and new would be most welcome. Perhaps very little exercise of special
217 skills would be required due to the boost from -CECIL--. Thanks so much
218 large and capable friend. (I hope!)((I'll bet if The Man in Grey had
219 been here the adventure would have been even more colorful))
220   
221    During the lull, while the duty rodents were resolving the on-going
222 issue of the existence of a supreme Ego, (as separate from the creator)
223 the ancient alchemist pulled the transmuter communication module from
224 his tunic. After flipping it open and tuning it to another trans-reality,
225 he began talking into it. "Aaron, I'm not exactly sure of the exact
226 passage to which you refer. None of them were in fact specifically
227 directed toward DEBORAH. You have no doubt noticed that, while some
228 seek in order to find something, others seek simply for the sake of
229 seeking. That's what makes for the glorious diversity of people and
230 ideas. Well I must return. I see events are continuing to develop."
231   
232 Looking up to the cliffs above he noticed someone looking back. "Hmm,
233 where did I put my far looker.", he murmured. So saying he pulled a
234 gadget out of his tunic and put it to his eyes. "I do believe it's
235 Milchar.", he said aloud. Then cupping his hands to his mouth he
236 yelled up toward the overhanging precipice, "Come on down and join
237 us. We need all the good talent we can get."
238   
239 "Guess I better get the transmuter's gyro up to speed", he mused.

342   The piper had screwed up his courage and ventured out onto the foredeck of
343 their aeronatically inclined watercraft.  Somehow the attitude of his fellow
344 travellers -- a kind of "so what were 500 feet up in the air on the back of
345 what we thought was a sea serpent?  Pass the pitcher of ale."  quieted his
346 fears.  Really, this fear of heights was very unmanly.  How could he hold
347 his head high when it made him ill to look over the railing of a bridge?  
348 After all -- it wasn't the fall that hurt -- it was the sudden stop at the
349 bottom.  Nevertheless, he studied the billowing clouds above the deck, rather
350 than the view below as he moved forward.
351   Moving to the fore part of the deck, he could see very little exept the broad
352 swatches of color that were the creature's wings extending to each side.  
353 Curiously, he looked back and saw another set behind the loop that held the 
354 boat.  Looking forward he saw a circle that looked like a henge -- a curiously
355 regular henge in exceptionally good repair.  Perhaps he had harshly judged this
356 culture with so little contact.  Such a structure could be built only by a
357 people well versed in the Mysteries.
358   Suddenly, he realized that this portion of their journey had come to an end.
359 The sudden solidity of his footsteps came as a shock.  The deck of the vessel
360 was canted at a slight angle -- it was firmly placed in the bed of a small
361 valley.  Looking for the serpent, the piper walked to the side of the vessel
362 and searched the sky and river.  Leaning over the side of the boat, he felt
363 an unfamiliar weight swinging around his neck.  Looking down, he found a golden
364 collar fashoned in the form of a serpent with its jaws firmly clamped around
365 its own tail.  From the weight, the object was gold, it was too small to slip
366 over his head and he could find tno catch or hinges.  Feeling a slight touch
367 of nervousness, a question formed in his mind.  Could it really have -- ???
368   As from a great distance came a reply. #YES LITTLE BEING, IT COULD#

402 L'homme: "And (L'homme), I NEVER miss!"
403 
404 lesse...where DID i put that holo-disk? of course! aisle 7, shelf 3, bin C..
405 must be here..(casually drop a disk into wall-mounted viewer)...no, not the
406 ice-ages...(another disk)...certainly not the middle ages!, lessee..(final
407 disk in bin C) yes, yes...1984, Maryhill! 
408   Now just to step over to the Atavachron.... ahh, excelent! no compensation
409 necessary for a trip less than 24 hours....gee, this console looks familiar,
410 something Gary Seven might own....
411   Calling through the time portal, "Hello, hello?" yields no response...
412 hmmmm.. nobody there? That trans-reality audio-gram did arive from this 
413 time-line.....      puzzled.. until.. ##SMALL CREATURE, YOUR FRIENDS WILL
414 LAND SHORTLY##    ...Hmmmm. "Land"? they must be travelling by air..why, 
415 there they are now! And there's the one with the multi-phasic transmuter!
416 "Hey, you, the one with the multi-phasic transmuter" "Who, me?" comes the
417 reply.."Yes, you. Say, you don't look like the alchemist!" "I'm not. Sorry.
418 I'll get him. Name's Piper. say, just, uh, where, uh, are you?" stepping
419 through the time curtain.... "Right in back of you." "Oh. I'll get the
420 alchemist...lemme guess..you play the pipes to, right?" 
421  "Alchemist, in my communique I was refering to your sudden "appearence"
422 coincident with the percieved lack of "true" SF in the adventures. My
423 conclusion was that, though a brilliant effort, you still haven't REALLY
424 brought things to a more, ur, 'scientific', air" I addressed, sensing that
425 my old friend alchemist was very close (i could smell the brimstone cologne
426 he oft used to convince the Monarch that he was still working on the 'ol
427 Pb-Au tripe..), figguring he had sneaked up behind me while I was chatting
428 with Piper, and having delivered my message, I slipped thru the portal that
429 was just to the left of Piper saying "Goodbye, alchemist..you'll never be
430 able to sneak up on me!"
431  Feeling satisfied, I swept the holo-disks back into their bin, and reaching
432 for the one still in the viewer, noticed that the Piper now stood alone on
433 the deck of the craft, seemingly mumbling to himself....
434 Having closed the Portal, I couldn't hear the Piper mumble "no, I guess not"

441 Milchar throws his essence 'pon the winds, and asks the burning question, what
442 am I doing here??

444 similar effects.>>

447 Field mice are a bunch of DRONES!  And as far as the puny little man who calls
448 himself the Third Doctor is concerned
449 , he can cram his TARDIS up his nose
450 .  He really should learn how to play a
451 decent game of chess.  DEATH TO THE
452 FIELD MICETHE "THIRD DOCTOR" IS CLUMSY ENOUGH TO TRIP OVER HIS TARDIS AND
453 BREAK HIS NECK.
454   May Milchar have a nice day!

458 Bob Nash: Sure they are easy...why didn't you answer them?
459 Aaron...What's this? You are actually trying to partake in this adventure?
460 How strange...Your mother wouldn't approve... By the way, the agency has been
461 running some scans and we think we have narrowed down 'chez toi'. Concentric
462 circles are doing the trick, along with phone traces, and unathorized access
463 in the library ala Mr. Satos. Why couldn't you pick the 5000 years ago disk
464 and get marooned with Mrs James Garner? Anyway, expect agents to be knocking
465 on your door anyday now, as soon as we get the exact city block calculated.
466 This is what happens when you get caught going through Bell garbage, if you
467 get my meaning... Since you seem reluctant to answer any of the 'trek' quotes,
468 here is my final edition (stop the applause out there)...

476 During the long journey down the river (which somehow seemed shorter than
477 I expected), I had spent all of my time reading some of the ancient
478 books I had found behind the green door. Thank heavens for the book titles
479 "Rossetta", that allowed me to translate the ancient writings into one of
480 the languages I did speak. There were some interesting stories in the books,
481 as well as several spells that might come in handy to someone who knew how
482 to use them. Playing the role of student, I wrote several of the more 
483 interesting incantations down on 3 by 5 cards to study some more later. I
484 still had my voodoo doll, and a couple bottles of foul smelling substances.
485 When I felt the ship hit what I thought was our destination, I put away the
486 magic stuff into my pack, and went up on deck. Everyone seemed to be running
487 in different directions...some were quite obviously drunk, while the piper
488 was off the boat, no where to be found. I could't find Bard or apprentice
489 either. Anyway...I tried to tell some of them about what I had been so 
490 engrossed in, but again, just as that famous crew member on the Dark Star,
491 my overtures were brutally rejected! "I should turn some of these people
492 into rodents", I thought to myself while thinking about the "Rodent Spell"
493 written on one of the cards. "No...I don't want to misuse this new power,
494 anyway, I might end up shooting myself in the foot!"
495 I then set about looking for the alchemist (he seems to have a good head
496 on his shoulders), and piper, who also seems to know most of the time
497 what's going on. I jumped off the ship..."How in the heck did it get all
498 the way up here anyway???", and went in search of the other adventurers.

526 A sudden thump startles the Mage, as the boat he is on runs aground (!!!!UNDER
527 STATEMENT OF THE YEAR!!!!).  A small Fly spell puts him on the dry earth without
528 having to dirty himself.  He sees piper scramble down the side of the ship 
529 just before him.  Milchar looks aroupnd at the valley, takes into account the
530 positions of the stars and planets,
531 finds the Nth root of negative i and concludes in a nonchalant manner, "I think
532 we're lost."
533 Piper says nothing, but examines the area closely.  Another man looks down on
534 the two, obviously wondering what had happened, while carrying a three-foot
535 stack of 3 x 5 cards.  Milchar says, "My spell books are more compact.  Did I
536 hear you think of a Mouse Changing spell??"

539    Sitting watching the events unfold I sit near the bow of our strange 
540 craft. Taking a quick look at the display of my reality transphaser I see 
541 that the anomaly of the Maryhill henge if just up the hill, less than a
542 quarter mile, we are in between it and the river. The Piper seems to hace 
543 acquired himself a torc which fairly reeks of magic. Oh well, let's check
544 and see wheather the henge can be used for reality hopping...
545    ...As I walk amoung the huge stones I keep glancing at the small plasma
546 display, just a few more feet to the right, this ought to do...
547    ...A small rodent squeaks annoyedly as a double clap of thunder 
548 accompanies my dissapearance and the my reappearence.
549    "Everyone! Quickly! while I have the way clear to the Inn!" I yell to
550 the others before I step through once more...
551    ...The rowan tree is pretty now that spring has brought new leaves, can
552 it be that the inn seems a more cheerful place than when I departed it?
553 The sign has been repainted, the windows cleaned, and all of autumn's leaves
554 and the fallen branches of winter cleared away, even the roof has been 
555 repaired with new slates showing dark amoung the older weathered ones.
556 I feel cheered as I step though the door...

563   To the first two 'DOCTORS' concerning the 'THIRD DOCTOR':  Don't worry about
564 this puny little creature!  He and his TARDIS are both a bunch of WIMPS.  Take
565 it from someone who knows.  Don't ever ask him to play chess.  He has never
566 learned to play a decent game and you will just die of boredom.

576 "These 3 by 5's are kind of cumbersome. I need to find a better way to store
577 these spells. Maybe apprentice has something in his ever present pack I can
578 use for storage, if he ever gets back!" I put most of the cards away, but
579 kept out 3 or 5 of the best most potent spells, including the rodent
