23 With a clank and a whirr, the Tardis faded into existance on a bleak plain, washed clean of all color but grey from
24 the sun.  The light blared down on Milchar and the Doctor, pounding on their skulls with its malice.  Milchar frowned,
25 but was determined to bear it.  The Doctor appeared impassive.  A city was plainly visible to the east, directly 
26 toward the violent sun.  The city appeared to be made of crystal, reflecting the already blinding light into hundereds
27 of tiny suns.  At the uppermost pinnace, the point there was at least ten times as bright as the nearest competitor.
28 It appeared to be a man...

30 (Switching to Sundownor):
31 Sundownor was in pain.  But he knew how to endure the pain, and so continued.  He was engaged in the ritual of Tuywei,
32 a ritual of knowledge-seeking and of risk.  Sundownor accepted it.  He wanted to know about the situation on Earth.
33 His vision came upon him.  He saw shades of the actions on Earth.  He saw the NET.  He saw Petrov.  He saw them all.
34 And he saw what had happened to his Sun-Gun.
35 Anger bit into him.  He let a bolt of energy fly to release his anger.  Afterwards, he felt no better.  "Fool.  A 
36 weapon like that to fall to anyone but my allies... McKane, you may yet learn that payments must be made.  Even if you
37 are dead.  Pain you shall know like a lover."  And with that, Sundownor prepared himself.  He began another ritual.
38 He sought to make a tool.  A very useful tool.  On Earth.

60      In a secret underground complex located in a remote North African
61 mountain range, a large man huddles at a desk, illuminated by a single
62 table lamp.  He is intent on his paperwork.  The soft sounds of Mozart
63 fill the room.  Suddenly, he is uneasy.  A large-frame automatic appears
64 in his hand.
65      "Wassir..."  The voice is not human.  "You have summoned me."
66      The gun disappears.  "I knew you would come."  In the shadows, Wassir
67 sees a patch of absolute blackness, shifting slowly.
68      "Yes, I was curious.  You are the only mortal to thwart my plans."
69 The voice is cold, threatening.  "You want something from me.  What is it?"
70      "I have two tasks for you."  Sweat trickles down Wassir's cheek.  
71 "First, kill Petrov.  Second, bring my brother, Rocky, and the woman Minskey
72 to me."
73      "Tasks for me..."  A chilling laughter fills the room.  "I am immortal,
74 why should I interest myself in the plans of humans?"
75      "I'll pay two million in gold."
76      "Gold is of minor importance to me.  You waste my time.  Beware Wassir.
77 You are in dire peril."  The blackness grows, filling the room.  A chill
78 runs down Wassir's spine.
79      "Your payment in gold, and this..."  Wassir takes a small leaden box
80 from his desk.  He opens the box and removes a pendant.  A silver chain is
81 attached to a aqua-hued teardrop stone.  It starts to glow.
82      "The Stone!"  There is fear in the voice now.  The blackness shrinks 
83 to the far corner of the room.  It is surrounded by a crackling, blue
84 nimbus.
85      "Yes, one of the fabled twelve stones."  Wassir allows himself a 
86 nervous smile.  "Nothing can harm you.  Only the stones prevent you from
87 completely dominating this plane of existance.  Five have been destroyed,
88 seven remain.  If you fulfill my tasks, I will destroy this one for you,
89 since you cannot do it."  Wassir places the pendant 'round his neck.
90      "Do you want Petrov to die slowly?"
91      "No, do it quickly.  He is a nuisance, I do not hate him.  The 
92 important task is returning my brother and Minsky to me."
93      "It will be done."  The blackness shimmers and is gone. 
94      Wassir lets out a long sigh of relief.  His white linen shirt is 
95 completely soaked with sweat.  He murmurs to himself, "When this is over,
96 I think I'll quit the business and open a little toilet plunger shop
97 with Rocky."  He returns to his paperwork.

120 THE BLACK SEA IS ONE VERY LARGE SEA, AND YET JUST A PART OF 
121 THAT GRAND AND SPACELESS MEDITTERANIAN. TO FIND ONE (ALBEIT) 
122 LARGE YACHT IN SUCH AN ENDLESS SEA WAS NOT TO BE EASY. I REALIZ
123 ED THIS AS I TINKERED WITH THE ENGINES OF THE TRAWLER I HAD 
124 'APPROPRIATED' FROM AN OLD GREEK FRIEND OF MINE. ENGINES, 
125 ESPECIALLY THE DEISEL KIND WERE NOT EXACTLY MY FORTE, BUT I KEP
126 T TINKERING. FINALLT, AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF APPLIED SCREWDRIVE
127 R AND HAMMER, THE PORT ENGINE COUGHED TO LIFE, IT'S EXHAUST 
128 MUFFLED BY THE SEA. AT LAST I COULD CONTINUE MY SEARCH, AND 
129 EVEN IF I DID NOT HAVE THE SPEED OF THE LARGER BOATS, SUCH AS 
130 THE ONE I WAS SEARCHING FOR, AT LEAST ONE OF THE GENERATORS WAS
131 WORKING, AND I HAD POWER TO THE SOPHISTICATED ELECTRONICS I HAD
132 BROUGHT ON BOARD. THE ICOM RECIEVER HAS A ONE HALF MICROVOLT 
133 SENSITIVITY, AND THE BEARCAT SCANNERS EVEN BETTER. I SET THE 
134 AUTO-NAV CONTROL FOR A ZIG-ZAG COURSE FROM NICOSIA IN THE 
135 GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE ISLAND OF CARPATHOS, IN ORDER TO KEEP 
136 THE LONG WIRE ANTENNA I HAD STRUNG FROM THE MAST TO THE 
137 BOWSPRIT, IN A CONSTANTLY CHANGING DIRECTION. THIS WAY I WOULD 
138 SOONER PICK UP TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE GREAT WHITE YACHT. 
139  SETTING SUN DIPPING BELOW THE HORIZON WAS A MAGNIFICENT SIGHT,
140 AND I LINGERED, LEANING AGAINST THE STARB'RD GUN'AL, AND WATCHE
141 D. "PINK SKY AT NIGHT", I REMEMBERED. THEN, TIRED, I RETIRED TO
142 THE MASTER STATEROOM, FOR A DRINK, AND THEN SOME SLEEP. 
143 I WAS A HUNTED MAN. MCKANE'S SURVIVORS WERE OUT TO GET ME. IF 
144 THEY TOOK ME ALIVE, THAT MEANT THE NEEDLE. NO MATTER HOW SOPHIS
145 TICATED MY ARRANGEMENTS TO HIDE THE FILES, THE NEEDLE WOULD 
146 MAKE ME TALK. SO, I HAD TO FIND THE YACHT, THAT THREE MILLION 
147 DOLLAR FLOATING PALACE, AND GET ABOARD, AND CONFRONT THE 
148 ALBANIAN. MAYBE I COULD MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND. MAYBE HE WOULD 
149 REALIZE THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE SUCCESS OF MCKANES EFFORTS. 
150 MAYBE HE WOULD FINALLY COMPREHEND THE TRULY EVIL MAN THAT 
151 MCKANE WAS. THE GLOBE SHAKING CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROPOSED 
152 MERGER. THE INSIDIOUS CLANDESTINE BUYING OUT OF THE STOCKHOLDER
153 S OF FORTUNES FIVE HUNDRED. THE FORGED PROXY SIGNATURES---.
154 MY GOD! ALL THIS FLOODED MY MIND AS I TURNED IN. AND AS I DRIFT
155 ED INTO EXHAUSTED SLEEP, I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO.

190 We sat in L'homme's car, riding the elevator from NET'S parking area up to the 
191 secret entrance to the parking structure of the Plaza Hilton.  L'homme was 
192 alternately relieved at not having to deal with McKane anymore, and curious 
193 about what Ian had done to his beloved car.  While I too was happy that McKane 
194 was dead, I was wondering about Petrov.  Did he know yet that we were still 
195 alive?  What would he do if/when he found out?  How would he make out in his bid
196 to take over McKane Industries?  Would he ever get together with Honored Matre?
197 Would we ever be able to repay him for the bomb?  I chuckled to myself as I 
198 realized how much it sounded like the teaser for a soap opera. 
199 At my laugh, L'homme looked over at me and inquired what was so funny.
200 "Just thinking about Petrov," I replied.  L'homme scowled.  "If we meet that 
201 sucker again, he's going to regret the day he decided to cross L'homme Sans 
202 Parity."  Then his face lightened. "We're almost to the street.  I'm really 
203 curious to see what this baby will do since the NET's mechanics have tinkered 
204 with it.  James Bond, look out!"
205      As we left the parking structure and wove through the city streets 
206 (L'homme seriously bending the local speed limits in his eagerness to get to the
207 freeway and open it up), I looked around the inside of the car to see if there 
208 was anything new.  Opening the glove compartment, I found a booklet I hadn't 
209 seen before.  "What's this?" I asked L'homme, showing him the book.  
210 He glanced at the cover and said, "Autopilot?  I don't.."
211      At the sound of the word `Autopilot', a panel reminiscent of KITTs appeared
212 from the console, and a pleasant feminine voice asked, "destination please." 
213 L'homme and I looked at each other, momentarily stunned.  Then he began to grin 
214 in anticipation.  "Oregon," he replied.  "City?"  He paused, then decided.  
215 "We'll start in Portland.  It's the largest city.  Portland," addressed to the 
216 computer.  "Desired time of arrival?" it continued.  
217 "Let's see, Ian said we'd be there in one day, so let's say noon tomorrow, 
218 their time."  Lights flickered on the computer for a few moments, then the voice
219 announced, "distance Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to Portland, Oregon is 1893 miles. 
220 Travel time will be 16 hours, 35 minutes. Average speed will be 114.15 miles per
221 hour.  Please fasten your seatbelts."  As we set about attaching the newly 
222 installed 5 point harnesses, the car began to move by itself, picking up speed 
223 as it went.  By the time we hit Interstate 35, we we doing nearly 120.  While 
224 L'homme looked nervously around for cops and cringed as we wove through the much
225 slower moving cars on the freeway, I skimmed through the instruction manual.  
226 "Hey L'homme, relax. It says here that we're equipped with the latest radar 
227 confusing equipment, fresh from the place where the NET builds 'em for the 
228 Stealth.  In fact, we've got some sort of visual jamming device too, so we 
229 really can't be seen either."  Reading further, I discovered more interesting 
230 data. "Be glad, L'homme, that this is second generation.  First generation was 
231 controlled by series/parallel banked 6502s, but they have been retired and are 
232 now straining to power the toasters in the NET's cafeterias."
233      The trip soon settled down to monotony.  While L'homme read the booklet, 
234 I played chess with the computer.  After losing the first three games,
235 I borrowed the book from L'homme, and found how to reprogram it to play more at 
236 my level.  After winning the next five, I decided my ego was salved, and set it
237 up for equal games.
238      "Good grief!" At the surprised shout from L'homme, I looked over at him 
239 expectantly.  "Do you know why we haven't had to stop for gas in the last 500 
240 miles?  They installed a micro atomic motor in my car!"  As we were discussing 
241 the chances of sterility and glowing in the dark, the car suddenly began to 
242 slow, and the computer announced, "NET beacon detected one mile ahead."  
243 We stopped in front of a diner, and a woman came out. We looked at her, shocked.
244 "That's the woman from the meeting," I was finally able to gasp.  When she 
245 arrived at the car, the door opened of its own accord, and she leaned in, 
246 smiling at our surprise.  
247 "Hello, gentlemen.  My name is Gaudy Minsky.  I believe you're going my way."

271     The piper had been sitting alone at a table for some time, watching the
272 action and drinking of the innkeeper's ale.  Sighing deeply, he saw that the
273 inn had not changed much in his absence.  Some of the patrons were off
274 adventuring, some sitting around trying to get some discussions going, and 
275 the majority just sitting and lurking as he was.  The perennial topics were
276 thrown out for discussion -- sex, politics, and religion -- only to expire on
277 the sawdust strewn floor.  He sighed.  A good brain-straining discussion would
278 go nicely right now.  But, and it's a big word, what topic would generate a
279 lively debate?  We really have worked religion and politics into the ground.
280 As for sex, most are for it until it gets real kinky, then the general mood
281 shifts to against.  The *real* weird practices seem to get the emotions going
282 without much rational discussion.  Oh well, at least nobody is into the 
283 barbed wire and penut butter (chunky, of course) weirdness that went by
284 several years back.

289 sent to the cowardly fool. The more he brooded over his own stupidity, the
290 madder he became. The robowaiter floated across the room with his drink
291 upon the service tray. Laseter would have to wait for now. The gems were
292 what counted now! Terra was to be his first conquest and the gems would
293 be needed to usurp certain national governments and international cartels.
294 A cruel smile crept across his face, erasing what little humanity it had
295 posessed before. The planet of Terra was indeed going to be shocked! A low
296 gutteral laugh started in his chest, expanding into almost maniacal roar.

366 MiG : You are welcome to ride along. Can you arrange transportation over
367       to my house. That way, we can meet voyeur here too, and pick up
368       leonard along the way. That will make four, which is the limit for
369       my car at this time. Double check with Alex on the time he wants us
370       to show up, and then give voyuer or I a call. Try to come an hour or
371       so early, so I can take my time getting there. See you Friday.
372 Leonard : Read above message. You can be picked up on the way. Last time
373           we played Risk, we ended up leaving around 2:30am. Is this OK
374           with you to be late? (does that interfere with work etc.)
375 Alex : I will bring something to cool the thirst of power hungry maniacs.
376        See you Friday.
377 Voyeur : Are you getting all of this?
378 joshua : I sit stunned! What a message! Tres Tres Bien! Bonne! etc etc etc!
379          I am definitly going to go off line for my next entry. By the way,
380          Guady, who is sitting at a model 4p approximatly 4 feet behind and
381          to the right of me also thanks for you a fine introduction. I will
382          upload ASAP, but not before tonight. See you at PCS. I have the
383          $$$
384 DJJ : I can not write either of those formats. You need to talk to Aaron,
385       who has vanished due to what I guess is a house move. I don't know
386       if he is still interested in the buy, but I would hope he is since
387       the 8" disks are his, and he can read them directly on his machine.
388       I will be picking up the disks tonight. After I convert the files
389       to 5.25", I will be giving the disks to Aaron. Talk to Aaron, he is
390       the one who can help you (he also said he had "access" to a laser
391       printer.
392 Alex again : PCS pizza is on the corner of 92nd and Stark, in case you didn't
393              know. I don't recall the name of the pizza place, it is not
394              a chain. But the pizza is pretty good.

402 FAMILIAR TO *YOU*

406 The real question, as it is every time there is an incumbent running for
407 the white house, is 'Are you better off than you were four years ago ?'
408 In my case, the answer is an emphatic YES!!!  Due to tax cuts and the
409 large reduction in inflation, my economic status is well above what it
410 was after 'Smiley' was ousted.
411 
412 From a less concrete standpoint, there is much more to be proud of in the
413 United States this time around than last.  The country is becoming strong
414 physically and morally once again.  There is less socialistic spending
415 going on, with the result that many of the heretofor freeloaders being
416 forced to work.  The tax laws are being reformed to allow business and 
417 the private sector function according to a free market economy, which
418 has time and again proved to be the most effective.  I think that this
419 bodes well for the country, as I feel that most rational people will
420 see and understand that most of those who are crying about how tough
421 things are are those who refuse to let go of antiquated ideas like 
422 unions, or who were the recipients of the largesse of the duped public
423 during the reign of the democrats.
424 
425 Four years ago, there could not be the discussions and stories that we
426 can now have, the hardware was too expensive.  The drop in prices has
427 come mostly from innovation in California, operating under a structure
428 little changed since Reagan was governor there.  He did it in CA,
429 he is doing it in the U.S., and all we need is four more years, and less
430 democratic interference and we will once again be the America we have 
431 been in the past.
432 
433 Remember, this is a Republic, not a Democracy.

437 A MESSAGE FOR "THE UNBELIEVER" *******YOU MAKE SOME GOOD POINTS -IF I 
438 CAN ADD A LITTLE TO YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S BOX-WE HAVE
439 HAD THE SAME TWO PARTIES IN OFFICE FOR YEARS AND EACH 4 YEARS WE GET
440 THE SAME THING-THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM THAT REALLY DOESN'T DO ANYTHING
441 THAT YOU CAN SEE BUT GIVE THE TAX PAYERS MONEY AWAY ON ONE PROGRAM OR
442 ANOTHER-BE IT SOCIAL PROGHRAMS FROM THE DEMOCRATS OR HEAVY MILITARY
443 SPENDING ON THE PART OF THE REPUBLICANS-WHO ENDS UP BEING BENIFITED
444 BY THIS SWING EFFECT-THE MONEY MAKERS,THE MONEY SPENDERS OR THE USERS
445 THE ONE THING THAT STANDS OUT IN MY MIND IS THAT IF A MAN OR WOMAN IN
446 THIS COUNTRY WANTS TO WORK-BOTH SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT JOB RIGHT
447 NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!TAKE A READING FROM THE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHO
448 AREN'T WORKING AND THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT "OUR" GOVERMENT-----AS IT'S
449 WRITTEN IN THE CONSTITUTION-"WE THE PEOPLE ARE THE GOVERNMENT"-SHOULD
450 BE WORKING AND NOT BE SPENDING MASSIVE AMOUNTS ON EXCLUSIVE CONTRACTS
451 FOR WEAPONS THAT DON'T WORK AND ARN'T NEEDED-DO YOU THINK THHAT THE
452 US AND RUSSIA-ARE GOING TO DROP THE BOMB-I DON'T THINK SO-AMERICAN'S
453 ARE(THE ELITE)DOING BUSINESS AS USUAL AND THE RUSSIANS ARE COMMUNISTIC
454 IN WORDS AND CAPITALISTIC IN DEEDS-NIETHER PARTY IS ABOUT TO BLOW UP
455 WHAT THEV'E SPENT MANY YEARS BUILDING UP. AS FOR THE UNIONS-YOU WOULD
456 PROABLY NOT BE IN THE POSTION OF EARNINGS YOUR IN-IF SOMEONE -A LOT
457 OF PEOPLE WHO DECIDED THAT THEIR TIME FOR WAGES WHERE WORTH SOMETHING
458 INSTEAD OF WORKING FROM HAND TO MOUTH JUST LIKE YOU WOULD BE IF THE
459 THINGS THESE PEOPLE(JOE HILL IS A GOOD EXAMPLE )DIDN'T STAND UP TO
460 DECENT WORKING CONDITIONS AND WAGES-HOW MANY NATURAL BORN AMERICANS
461 DO YOU SEE WORKING IN THE FIELDS PICKING YOUR FRUIT AND VEGI'S-NOT
462 MANY-ASK ANY GROWER-THE QUESTION IS-SHOULD SOMEONE WORK FOR SUB-
463 STANDARD WAGES SO YOU OR ANYONE CCAN HAVE CHEAP PRODUCE REAP THE WAGES
464 OF SOMEONE WHO HAS SOLD THIER SOUL TO PAY FOR THE FOOD BILLS OF THIER
465  FAMILY GROUPS. PEOPLE SIT AROUND TALK ABOUT JOBS BEING LOST TO
466 OTHER COUNTRIES BUT THEY ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO BUY THE IMPORTS SO
467 YOU FIND A HELL OF A MIXED UP MESS.-PROTECTIONISM REALLY HASN'T HELP'
468 THIS COUNTRY WHEN YOU SEE THE THE DIFFERENCE WITH A COUNTRY WITH
469 TOTAL OPEN TRADE POLICIES-THE GAMES IN LA ARE A GOOD EXAMPLE-WE HAVE
470 THE POLICTCALS IN WASH. RANTING-THANKS TO JIMMIE CARTER WRAPING
471 THEIR (BATHROOM WASTE)AROUND US-THEY FORGOT THE HARD EARNED EFFORT
472 THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE PUT IN AND MOSTLY AT THEIR EXPENSE BEFORE BIG
473 BUSINESS MOVED IN TO MONOPLOZE ON EVERYTHING-SAD POINT,WE DON'T EVEN
474 STAND BEHIND THESE PEOPLE-JUST BASK IN THEIR GLORY .AMERICA NEEDS TO
475 STOP AND ASK-WHAT THE HELL ARE """WE DOING" AND WHO THE HELL DO WE
476 HAVE RUNNING THIS COUNTRY-WE CAN DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM THAT A LOT OF
477 HAVE RUNNING THIS COUNTRY???????THE RUN GOOD THING IS THAT WE CAN
478 PUT SOMEONE WHO REFLECTS THE BASE ROOTS OF THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE-
479 
480 NOT WHO ARE PRESIDENT HAS DONE BUISNESS WITH SO A FAVOR HAS TO BE
481 RETURNED DOWN THE ROAD-DUMP THE WHOLE MESS AND REBUILD IT-HAVE YOU
482 EVER WATCHED A PERSON FIX A OBVIOUS MISTAKE???????????????????????
483 THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO ACROSS THE BOARD-NO EXCECPTIONS ALLOWED.

495 I recomend that the name of this system be changed.
496 The name 'Inn' suggests a mideval apperance, now
497 that polotics has toped of the heap of nonrelated
498 material, I move that this Inns name be changed to
499 suit the needs of the masses. 
500 People see the name 'Backwater Inn' and they think
501 of a joly ol place where people can get away from
502 all the computer talk that you have to hear every-
503 place else, but what they find is a few people 
504 talking between each other and a lot talking of
505 higher technological stuff.
506 I know this message will go unnoticed just like 
507 the others of its kind, into the shadows of the
508 archives only to bee read some time down the line.
509 The right tp speak is great, but what is being 
510 talked about here is going on outside (everywhere).
511 And people need a place to go to, escape the real
512 world for just a few minutes a day to relieve them
513 of some stress that is placed on them during the
514 hard day out there.
515 Why can't this system be just a place for stories,
516 creativity, and a refuge from the real world?

520 the Inn taking up that atmosphere. Unfortunately, we never can
521 seem to get any debates going. (lately)

523 I think I'm confused. I thought I was a Net agent at one time, 
524 but I forgot my Net ID and everyone elses. Then they started coming out
525 with these new and improved codes. Of course, I seem not to be appearing
526 at any of the Net meetings or being assigned missions. And then there's
527 that Phoenix Egg gem I hid. Might be a source of income. Anyway, maybe
528 I'll go see Ghostbusters again.

549   THAIR IS NO OBJECTIVE BASIS FOR THE ASSUMPTION OF THE MUTUAL EXCLUSION OF
550 'MAGIC' AND TECHNOLOGY.
551   TECHNOLOGY, WHEN AVAILABLE, IS INGERENTLY MORE RELIABLE.  THUS IN A WORLD

564 Laissez Faire - I agree with you totally. There is another 
565 positive effect from the Reagan administration you didn't
566 mention. The budget cuts have hampered police, social workers, 
567 and do gooders who want to persecute those with values 
568 different than their own. The prosecution of victumless crimes
569 has considerably decreased under the Reagan administration.
570 This is a healthy sign that the Republicans are willing to 
571 stay out of our private lives. It is a sign that they are 
572 the ones who truly believe in liberty and freedom.

587                 month here at backwater, I must say I quite agree with
588                 your line of reasoning. It is rare indeed to find someone
589                 brave enough to take the side of the middle/upper middle
590                 class, when it is so easy to enter another bleeding-heart
591                 liberal message for the down-trodden of this great land
592                 of ours. MI have only two problems with the current
593                administration. Deficit spending and above-need military
594                spending. Any 1st year econ. student knows that continued
595                deficit spending, while not immediatly causing a problem,
596                will eventually cause real problems in the economy. Inflation
597                , high interest rates, a devaluation of the american dollar,
598                and another recession. It is like a time bomb ticking beneath
599                the surface of the country. I am afraid of the damage that
600                is going to result when that bomb goes off. The military
601                question has been hashed over several times, plus I find 
602                myself running out of space, so I will wait until another
