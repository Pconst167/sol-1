23 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
24   A lone stranger approaches a fog shrouded stream and
25 pauses... searching for something...  After a moment he spies
26 that which he is looking for, an old well worn bridge.
27   The stream flows grudgingly beneath it, accepting its
28 presence, yet obviously wishing to be free of this construct
29 spaning its banks.  The stranger moves to cross the slightly
30 arched span.  He stops momentarily to peer down at the water
31 flowing beneath.  He watches the sluggish water flow beneath,
32 pondering its source and wence it flows.  
33   The stream slowly flowing beneath seems to have a soothing
34 effect on him, for as he peers below the hands that grip the
35 railing slowly relax.  After a moment he reaches into his
36 cloak and draws forth a faded and worn brown ribbon.  Holding
37 the ribbon before him for a while he looks upon it.  Soon a
38 single tear forms and slowly travels down the crease in his
39 face.  Holding the ribbon over the railing, he pauses for a
40 moment and then releases it to fall into the flowing stream.
41   He watches as the ribbon slowly drifts down, until finally
42 it touches the water and is quickly swallowed.  In a fleeting
43 moment it passes beneath the walkway and is gone.  
44   Raising his face to gaze at the fog enshrouded moon, the
45 light glistens off the wet trail on his cheek, the final
46 rememberence of things past.  Slowly the face changes from one
47 of sadness to resolve. 
48   After a moment he turns and peers thru the fog in the hope of
49 finding a place to rest his weary feet and warm his heart. Then
50 for a second the fog parts and a wavering glimmer of light
51 breaks through.  He moves towards the light and soon finds that
52 it shines upon the entrance to an establishment called the Back
53 Water Inn.  "What an odd name for an Inn" he thinks.
54   Seeing no other suitible establishment he decides to enter. 
55 As he opens the door and looks in, a warm draft of air ladden
56 with the smell of stale beer, soured wine and wiskey drifts
57 out.  Hearing an angered shout, he pauses and is about to
58 leave, but then realizes that it was not ment for him.
59   Stepping across the threshold he finds the Inn in shambles,
60 with empty and shattered glasses scattered about.  In a dark
61 corner he sees a timid lass attempting to clean off a table to
62 sit at.  As he watches a wonderous picture of a dragon slips
63 off the table and drifts to the floor.  Quickly the lady
64 recovers the picture and with averted eyes quietly sits down
65 and busies herself with another picture.
66   At another table sits a sailor he looks upon the shambles of
67 the Inn with disaproving eyes, yet is there not something else
68 in those eyes?  It is difficult to tell.
69   Looking further he sees several patrons leaning over a table
70 talking in some strange language with manied reference to
71 something called a 'cumpewtor'.
72   Off to one side sits a dark and sinister individual his face
73 hidden beneath a fold of cloth.  This individul speaks of
74 strange and fearful things, yet there is a touch of laughter
75 to his voice.
76   The Innkeeper himself stands behind the old worn bar slowly
77 cleaning a glass, worry and sadness on his face as he speaks to
78 a charming woman, whom he calls Pam, about the disarray of the
79 the Inn and other things.  While the lovly lady herself slowly
80 sips from a warm steaming glass of liquor and agrees while
81 wondering what can be done about it.
82   At the end of the bar a poor sole sits babeling meaninglessly
83 to himself, apparently no longer in full control of his mind. 
84   At the other end of the bar sits a warrior in full uniform. 
85 None dare approach to closly for he staunchly defends his
86 position. A formidable figure indeed.
87   Elsewhere sit several other patrons adding their voices to
88 the general flow of conversation.
89   To this does the stranger find he has entered. Though it is a
90 shambles, it is apparent that the Inn is well known and in
91 better times a most respectable and comfortable establishment.
92   The stranger sits and becons to the Innkeeper to bring him an
93 ale.  Perhaps he thinks I will tary for a while and learn more
94 of this place called the Back Water Inn.  Perhaps long enough
95 to no longer be a stranger in this most strange land.
96   As he accepts the drink from the Innkeeper and flips him a
97 coin in payment, he can feel the eyes of the patrons upon him,
98 and wonders what they think of this stranger who has intruded
99 himself in their midst.

104      In a light-faded corner she loiters, intent upon the work of her
105 hands and paying no mind to the surroundings.  A mug of cider, long 
106 since cooled, sits unnoticed by the delicate lines of a new sketch,
107 and her hair tumbles about her face as she tilts it to gain fresh
108 perspective on her drawing.  
Suddenly she tenses, though she does
109 not look up, and her demeanor takes on an appearance of listening...
110 Very still she is for three slow throbs of a heart, and then her eyes
111 lift and begin to wend their way through the milling crowd, fixing
112 each individual with a burning, penetrating gaze in turn.  
There, where
113 the Innkeeper has just placed a foaming glass of ale, there is where 
114 the ever-so-familiar voice resides!  She fastens her eyes on his face,
115 and a tiny wrinkle of puzzlement appears between her brows.  "Where
116 might a stranger find lodging?" asks he of the Innkeeper.  "Stranger?"
117 The words escape her lips unintentionally, but they are low enough to
118 be drowned in the leisurely roar of mixed conversations.  Several from
119 the bar gather nonchalantly around this man Tarn's table, and when he
120 happens to glance back in the corner, only the breeze-stirred papers
121 give evidence that she had been there.

149 THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE ABOVE. I LEFT FOR A SPELL, RETURNED AND STILL NO
150 NEW NEWS. SO.......................IT'S 1984.
151 AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH NEW YEAR PEOPLE TEOND TO THINK SOMEWHAT OF THE FU- 
152 TURE. HERE ARE SOME THOUGHTS CONCERNING MY VIEWS.
153 YOUR FUTURE CONSISTS OF MORE THAN JUST THE TIME THAT REMAINS OF YOUR PRESENT 
154 LIFE. IT ALSO INCLUDES HOW YOU USE THAT TIME, THE PLANS YOU HAVE MADE, THE 
155 GOALS YOU HAVE SET. AS ONE NOTED INVENTOR OBSERVED:" WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERN-
156 ED ABOUT THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TO SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES 
157 THERE."
158 WHY IS IT THOUGH THAT SO MANY GIVE SO LITTLE THOUGHT TO THE FUTURE? THERE ARE 
159 A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS. HERE ARE SOME OF THEM:
160    *THE ANXIETY AND STRUGGLE OF LIFE STIFLES THOUGHTS OF THE FUTURE.
161    *THE "NOW GENERATION" PHILOSOPHY PROMOTES THE VIEW, LIVE FOR THE MOMENT AND
162 THE FUTURE WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.
163    *THOSE PURSUING THE"WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE" WAY OF LIFE BELIEVE DESTINY 
164 ALONE SHAPES THE FUTURE.
165    *THE "WHATS THE USE" FEELING RESULTS IN DESPAIR AND DETERS SETTING GOALS
166 FOR THE FUTURE.
167 I AM NONE OF THE ABOVE.
168 SOME WONDER, "HOW CAN I HAVE A REALISTIC AND MEANINGFUL VIEW OF THE FUTURE?"
169 THE ANSWER MAY LIE IN WHAT NOBEL PRIZE WINNER JOHN GALSWORTHY WROTR
170 "IF YOU DO NOT THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE, YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE." GIVE SERIOUS 
171 THOUGHT FIRST TO WHAT THE FUTURE COULD BRING. NEXT THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD 
172 LIKE TO BE AND DO IN THAT FUTURE. THEN TAKE THE NEEDED ACTION TO DIRECT YOUR 
173 STEPS TOWARD THAT GOAL. MORE LATER.

184 interesting, prose like that rarely changes anyones mind(especially smokers!)

289 Rommel: I am reminded of a Quote from Robert Heinlein about government.
290 "If the horse can't jump the hurdle, shoot the horse. Keep on doing this
291 and eventually you will find a horse that CAN clear the jump --- IF you
292 don't run out of horses. This is the sort of plausible pseudologic that
293 most people bring to political affairs. It causes one to wonder if mankind
294 is capable of being well governed by ANY system of government."

298 The inn's lights flicker smokily as a vagrant breeze slams the door open.
299 The fire gives a burst of smoke, causing the patrons of the inn to cough
300 and curse.  A burly patron abandons a tarred leather jack of ale on the 
301 rough-hewn counter to close the door, then pauses briefly in the opening
302 his eyes searching through the roiling mists.  Faintly through the

323 The Feds and the trench coat boys are under terrific pressure

341 As he sits at a table sipping his cider (Ah, wondrous nectar!) and watching d 
342 create yet another of her wondrous creations, he hearshis name. Then, 
343 listening further he realizes that he was mistaken. There is another
344 apprentice in the inn. 
345 But what is this? He says he is apprenticed to one Prospero by name. Can it
346 be? This will indeed bear further investigation.

351 As the hot vapor of a patron's pipe swirls around in my nostril, I notice
352 a small group of vibrant chap's slapping one-anothers back and chorteling.
353 I wonder if those are the people I was sent to meet? Could that raven
354 bunch of men be the one's I have journeyed so long to see? Could those be
355 the men who are responsible for all I have gone through. There is only
356 one way to be sure...I must bait a trap, and lure them into it. If they
357 are the ones, then they will taste my mettle, but if they are not, then
358 they will not even realize they are being tested. The Inn is the perfect
359 place for my test. It is crowded, but the overall condition of most of the
360 patrons, and the dark, smokey qualities of the Inn, and the obvious non-
361 commital attitude of the 'I don't care, I only work here' Inn keeper make
362 the Inn the perfect place. So now I will steal away to an empty corner of
363 the Inn, and lay my trap, un-noticed by everyone...
364 Beware fellow patrons of the unleashed vengence of a man who seeks to even
365 up past deeds done. You may think nothing of me now, but in a few sweeps of
366 the system clock, you will know such furry as you have never known before!

418      The quay rocks slowly responding to yet another outbound ships wake.
419 With the motion so goes his thought...he begins his trudge wharfward ....
420  To the west he spies a small inlet, a cool stream that flows into this harbour,
421 In the remaining twilight he decides to inspect this unique feature.
422 In his childhood these streams that ebbed and flowed with the tides were sources
423 of hours of curiosity and wonderment ...from where did they come ... 
424 who as well took solace in their passage...what secrets could they tell....
425 Arriving at the inlet he views the remains of all manner of refuse. He scorns
426 disposal in this way. He thinks of the many miles of hard travel the stream 
427 undertook to come home only to have its arrival choked.  
428 Amongst this debris he sees at the high tide mark a small swatch of brown fabric
429 walking towards it and in the fading light he stoops to retrieve it.
430 .......satin ribbon...........
431  faded and well worn but satin none the less.  His mind awash with questions 
432 " How did something of such nobility come to rest in such squalor ? "
433 Was it around some young lovers scroll and cast by accident or design into this
434 stream ? Was it the last remaining evidence of some carnal atrocity ? Did some
435 servant drop it while washing ?
436  Suddenly he laughs out loud .....Remembering .........his childhood
437 He tucks the damp ribbon into his breast pocket and walks back towards the pier
438 mentaly arguing with himself ......as a child he always wanted to follow a
439 stream to its origin and was never allowed but now being between pasages 
440 the opportunity had arisen ........Would he ??  He had the time and no other pressing engagements ..................
441  It was decided He would enquire as to what lay upstream ............

476 TO: SUNNY    THE CONCEPT YOU INDICATED THAT WAS PROPOSED BY YOUR TEACHER
477 THAT THE SIMULARITIES OF A WHAT A WRITER WRITES AND THE REAL WORLD IS
478 A RESULT OF THE WRITERS INABILITY TO COPE WITH THE REAL WORLD IS NOT A
479 WHOLELY VALID CONCEPT. FOR A WRITER TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A REALISTIC
480 CHARACTER THAT THE READER CAN IDENTIFY WITH, THE WRITER MUST PROVIDE 
481 THAT CHARACTER WITH THE SAME THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AS ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL.
482 THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY HAVING TO DO SO IN A VERY LIMITTED SPACE AND WITH
483 WORDS THAT CANNOT TRULY EXPRESS THE FULL EMOTIONAL BEING OF THE CHARACTER
484 INVOLVED. THIS MEANS THAT TO FULLY FORM THE CHARACTER IN THE READERS MIND
485 THE WRITER MUST DRAW UPON EXISTING LIFE EMOTIONS THAT THE READER KNOWS
486 AND UNDERSTANDS. SO BY DRAWING A PICTURE WITH WORDS THROUGH REFERENCE TO
487 EXISTING EMOTIONAL CONCEPTS THE CHARACTER IS BUILT IN THE READERS MIND.
488 OFTEN THE WRITER DOES INDEED DRAW THESE PICTURES BY PULLING THESE EMOTIONAL
489 CONSTRUCTS OUT OF THEIR OWN PAST AS IT IS FAR EASIER TO WRITE ABOUT SOMETHING
490 YOU KNOW THEN NOT. BUT A WRITER WILL NOT RESTRICT THIS TO THEIR OWN LIFE THEY
491 PULL THESE EMOTIONAL CONSTRUCTS FROM ALL AROUND THEM. THUS A WRITERS WORLD
492 WILL INDEED REFLECT THEIR OWN LIFE, BUT NOT BECAUSE THEY CANNOT COPE WITH IT,
493 RATHER BECAUSE IT IS CLOSE AND EASY TO TRANSLATE TO WORDS. LOOK AT THE
494 WRITING ABOVE OF THE CHARACTER TARN. IN A VERY SHORT FEW WORDS TARN HAS
495 BEEN CREATED AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE SUFICENTLY
496 THAT YOU KNOW WHO AND WHAT HE IS. THIS WAS DONE THRU REFERENCE TO A VERY
497 STRONG EMOTIONAL PAST YET IT WAS NOT DESCRIBED IN DETAIL INSTEAD IT WAS 
498 LEFT TO THE READER TO CREATE THAT PAST IN THEIR HEAD WITH THE TOOLS GIVEN.
499 IN FACT, LOOK AT THE TARN CHARACTER HIMSELF, ALMOST NO DESCRIPTION WAS
500 GIVEN AS TO HIS APPEARANCE. THE ONLY THING THAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT HE
501 IS MALE, AND HE WAS WEARING A CLOAK. YET IN THE MIND HE HAS BEEN
502 TRANSFORMED INTO A REAL ENTITY. NOW LOOK AT THE ONE THAT FOLLOWS BY d, AGAIN
503 THERE IS LITTLE DESCRIPTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL HERSELF, ONLY ENOUGH TO
504 PROVIDE THE NEEDED FRAMEWORK FOR THE REST OF THE DESCRIPTION. HERE THOUGH
505 LITTLE RERFERENCE IS MADE TO THE INDIVIDUALS PAST IN DESCRIPTIVE FORM, ONLY
506 BY A VAUGE REFERENCE DO WE SEE A PAST CAUSE AT ALL, INSTEAD THE INTENT IS
507 ON THE PRESENT, SO ONLY ENOUGH OF THE PAST IS PROVIDED TO SUPPORT THE PRESENT.
508 NOW LOOK AT THE LATER WRITING OF THE SAILOR 'BRENDAN', AGAIN WE HAVE THE SAME
509 ELEMENTS, A REFERENCE TO A PAST THAT IS DEVELOPED THRU EMOTIONS RATHER THAN
510 WORDS. IN FACT, HERE WE KNOW EVEN LESS ABOUT THE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE
511 INDIVIDUAL ONLY THAT HE IS MALE, AND THAT WAS WRITEN SUCH THAT IT COULD EASILY
512 BE CHANGED TO FEMALE WITH A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF FUSS. THIS IS THE POWER OF
513 EMOTION, IT IS WHAT MAKES THE INDIVIDUAL, NOT WORDS ON PARCHMENT.
514 THAT IS WHY WRITERS USE EMOTIONAL REFERENCE. IT IS WHAT CREATES THE PICTURE.
515 THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE A ROLE IN HELPING THE WRITER COPE WITH
516 THIER OWN PROBLEMS, IT CAN HELP, BUT THEN SO DOES ANY OTHER FORM OF EMOTIONAL
517 RELEASE. THE SAME EFFECT CAN BE ACHIVED BY KEEPING A DIARY, OR DRAWING
518 PICTURES, OR SCUPTURE, OR HELPING OTHERS, OR ANY OTHER MEANS OF DIVERSION
519 THAT CAN ALLOW THE INDIVIDUAL TO PROVE TO THEMSELF THAT THEY ARE NOT THE
520 ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WITH THESE PROBLEMS. THOSE WHO DRINK TO TRY TO
521 DO THIS ARE THE TRULY SAD INDIVIDUALS, FOR THEY DO NOT PROVIDE A RELEASE
522 FOR THIS EMOTIONAL PROBLEM, THEY ONLY HIDE IT WITH ALCOHOL. THEY ARE YOUR
523 EXAMPLE OF THE INABILITY TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE.

536 Oblivious to the shouts of other patrons to "close the damned door" the burly
537 man stands in the partly open doorway listening intently.  Could it be...?
538   Stiffening, he glances down at the top of his right boot, and winking back
539 from the darkness is the amber gleam of a cairngorm set in the handle of his
540 last rememberance of his heritage.  Tucked neatly into the top of his sock
541 is a skean dubh -- the "black knife" of last resort.  This much has he kept.
542      Stepping into the fog-dank night, he lets the door slip closed behind
543 him, yet keeps hold of the rough-carved frame.  Out of the curly mist throbs
544 faintly but distinctly, the sound of the piob mor, the great pipes, calling,
545 luring, pleading and cursing him in turn.  
546      One scarred hand grips the frame of the door.  An even more scarred heart
547 yearns toward its home.

551      I agree with you that the evolution of the story that has 
552 recently appeared on Backwater is interesting. I, too, have 
553 enjoyed watching to see where it will go. 
554      I also agree that it's not particularly fruitful to a
555 analyze a persons problems from a persons writing. I think 
556 that writing can be a way to work through, or excape from ones 
557 day to day problems. But I don't see any advantage to try to 
558 draw conclusions about anothers personality from what they 
559 write.
560      Where I disagree with you is on your thoughts on 
561 characterization. Though I've enjoyed the descriptive passages 
562 thus far presented I've been disappointed in the lack of 
563 characterization.
564      Of the characters presented so far I can't say that I know 
565 much about any of them. Reading in a past, present, and future 
566 from their emotional content isn't enough. Not for me anyway. I
567 If a story is to hang together, and if I am to understand that 
568 I am reading the same story as everyone else, I need to know 
569 more about who they are, what their past is, why they are t
570 there, maybe even what they look like.
571      I also feel the prose would flow smoother if there were 
572 fewer fireplaces, fewer opening doors, and fewer adjectives.
573      Of course, it's easy, and unfair, for me to be critical 
574 since I have not contributed to this evolving saga. Perhaps a 
575 contribution should be required before one is allowed to 
576 criticize. I don't know. What-ever-the-case, I thought I'd 
577 offer my opinion.
578      My final unsolicited opinion. Perhaps the tale would flow 
579 better if each segment ended with something left hanging, some-
580 thing that is anticipated but not resolved. Like those old 
581 movie serials like Buck Rogers.
582      So much for me shooting off my mouth (or fingers). All in 
583 all I'm enjoying the novelette and am looking forward to seeing
584 where it will go from here.

609 It was a dark and stormy night.  Suddenly, bad writing rang out...

617 SOME TIME, AND I AM GROWING VERY CURIOUS.  YOU SAID IT WOULD BE UP AROUND
618 THE FIRST OF THE YEAR, AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD WITH GREAT ANTICIPATION TO

620 599 AND THIS DISK WILL SOON DISSAPEAR, SO I WILL TRY TO ENTER IT AGAIN.

622      I LOVE THE CURRENT RUNNING STORY!  IT REMINDS ME OF OTHER TIMES HERE AT
623 THE INN, BEFORE I EVER HAD THE COURAGE TO ENTER INTO THE FRAY.  I ONLY WISH
624 I HAD THE NERVE TO ADD TO THE CURRENT STORY LINE, BUT I DON'T TRUST MY OWN
625 WRITING ABILITIES ENOUGH TO ATTEMPT TO BECOME PART OF IT.  BUT PLEASE, KEEP
626 IT GOING, NO MATTER WHAT THE DETRACTORS MAY SAY.  REMEMBER DETRACTORS, YOUR
627 REMARKS MEAN NOTHING WHEN ALL YOU CAN DO IS CRITICIZE. SHOW US A BETTER WAY!
