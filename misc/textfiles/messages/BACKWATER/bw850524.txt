22   After a rather disgusting preformance a few disks back, I can tell that every
23 once in a while, other people have problems too.  Enter only is a deplorable
24 condition.  It does have advantages though.
25 
26   I am all for a new storyline.  And from the polls I have taken, everyone is
27 just a little bit sick of the Net stories and their headline snapping samplers.
28  
29   So, which shall it be?  Fantasy stories, or perhaps true science fiction.
30 A totally new spy story with different, and deeper chacters?  Many other ideas
31 are open to us.
32  
33   Personally, I prefer stories with a strong fantasy background, say, swords
34 and evil monsters.  But ships, and dingy interstellar pubs and inns.  No pun
35 or anything like that with Our in or anything.

46  those who want to read something a little different, here's something 
47 ritten in Middle English (appropriate for our Inn, no?).  A glossary will
48  so you can figure out what was going on.
49     Once there was a testif, likerous maid who thencheth that life in the city 
50  be yerne indeed.  She wanted to leave the farm because she was auntrous,
51 but also because her mother all day gruccheth and snibbeth.  So off she went
52 n the Liverpool Tombesteres all toty with excitement.  Soon after she
53 an to swink, along came a saucefleem gnof who much loved bobaunce and was
54 l ways corrumpable.  Now you wouldn't think our girl would be taken in
55 this gnof whose whole ambition was to swive her, but it was like jogelrye.
56 as a jangler and, before she knew it, she had given him her cliket.
57  few days later, caitif and full of wanhope, she returned home, bravely
58 floiting as she trudged through the greves.  For once, her mother did not snib
59 r daughter told of the gnof who through his fuminositee, fneseth, routeth,
60 yexeth all night long.  In short, he was full wlatsom and tikel to boot.
61 tory, indeed, but soon finished.  Indeed, before long, our maid was
62  and happy as a brokking lark or rubible, but perhaps not quite so
63 testif as before.

82 My apologies for the poor upload.  I was trying a different terminal program,
83 and as you can see, it didn't quite cut it.
84 CISTOP - feel free to delete it (starting with the double row of ?????),
85 and I will upload it again later from a different machine. (it's only a poor
86 archaic RS Model 1, but it WORKS).
87 L'homme - you are intimately familiar with the terminal program what I am 
88 at this moment using.  (THAT I am using).  Last chance is PC-TALK, unless
89 Cistop chooses to make Copylink available, or I get my hands on that
90 vaporware version of Pro-Yam.

93 -so        it seems that i should be writing another one of these
94 entries right about now.  the next time you here the words
95 i'll tell you that i'm happy if you want me to
96 try to remember what the words were before them and i will have some
97 firghtening self slander for you when we next meet. i said that it
98 seems time for another entry but it is not. i have decided that there
99 should not be anymore of this depressive atmosphere in my ramblings
100 any longer. i will leave it up to the others... for now.

105 Have you been downtown and tripped over the "save or religion" group?
106 If Scientology can get by as religion maybe we could claim BWMS as a 
107 religion, and we worship here in the Inn. Tax free. High priest Mike
108 presiding over holy ale???? It's worth a try.
109 In a more serious vein, Mike, could you put the date at the bottom of
110 your disk header, say at about line 18, instead of at the top? It's the
111 best way to find out how much I have missed since I was last on, but how
112 many many time have I read the disclaimer??

115 It started with only four people and a mule.  One and the mule were out
116 of town. Our employer was gone, gone much to long for a normal buying
117 trip.  We began to worry.  Not so much that we were worried about pur
118 boss but more that we were worried about the fact that he owed us at
119 least 2 months wages and it wasn't below him to skip out.  
120   After about 3 weeks of waiting for the boss to return the credit
121 collectors started pounding on our door.

134      "Very good, Grann, very good.  You've improved amirably.  I believe you
135 are ready to help me with a project I've been considering for some time now.
136 I'd like to build a transferrance room," Milchar said to his bright Gnomish
137 pupil, who had just appeared without preamble out of thin air.
138      "A transferrance room?  I believe I read something about one of those in
139 Library D.  A portal to any number of selected places, I believe," the Gnome
140 stated as he sat down on the lawn chair that was placed beside the one Milchar
141 was reclining on.  It was a beautiful, sunny day in Celene.
142      "Yes, that is it.  I would like to have a way to easily get to all of the
143 chambers within the tower.  As you know, there are at least 1,394 chambers
144 cataloged in Library A, only 200 or so in actual use.  Numerous other tunnels,
145 side passages, and dimensional twists make Rindoven a cartographer's nightmare.
146 The previous occupants, if there ever were any, left no trace of their being.
147 It was only discovered after my father bought this land, decades ago.  I can
148 remember our exploration party getting lost, after they had gotten inside..."
149      Grann listened patiently to Milchar ramble on, slightly amused at his
150 fond recollection of past events.  "Will this help me with the magic contest?"
151      Milchar stopped abruptly, and considered the question.  "If you can build
152 a transferrance room, my boy," he said, "you can go ANYWHERE"
153      "Anywhere?  How will that help?"
154      "If nothing else, then you can go to a place where a wizard will teach
155 you the skills you need to win the contest.  Speculum, for instance.  One
156 dimension away 'vertically', only a short jaunt."
157      Grann seemed satisfied after hearing this, and agreed to help.
158      Milchar stood up, streched.  "But first, we must get some materials.
159 Gather up the travelling books, we're off to collect a few rare minerals.  Oh,
160 get a pick or two and pack some food, will you?  I'll look after the other
161 arrangements.  We'll sleep, then move off in the morning.  Off with you, now!
162 Mind, rest your powers, and don't teleport in.  You've drawn up enough power
163 out of you for one day.  Use too much, and..." Milchar let his voice trail off.
164      "I won't.  In the morning, then."
165      "In the morning."

173 Milch: Very Interesting.
174       The battered fughter half sat, half fell into his chair.  There was some-
175 thing about the way he looked, sort of half dead.  His chain shirt was much
176 beaten, bent and in places rusted.  one eyelid was half swolen shut.
177       The INN's fine aile did much to revive his spirit and he could not help
178 overhearing the tale of an edifice whose rooms and passages were half unknown
179 even to its present owners.  It sounded a welcome change from the pits of 
180 EAMON ware he had receintly aquired the style: the late zymph.  A nice dingey
181 dusty back corner to rest his weary mace and perhaps do a bit of exploring.
182       but then the mage and his student had drifted seperately back toward the
183 sleeping rooms.  perhaps I'll look them up in the morning zymph thought to
184 himself as he ordered a large slab of roast beast.

195   Grief is not a "socially acceptable" emotion.  In certain cases, it is 
196 socially required -- at the funeral of a loved? one -- but still it is an
197 emotion that we find culturally emberassing.  It is somehow "well bred" to
198 supress the pain and rage we feel.  Pain, cutting, tearing at our innermost
199 self, leaving emotional scars and wounds that feel, at the time, that they
200 can never be healed.  Rage, the raw, red fury at the world that allows such
201 a thing to happen.  Fury that, unleashed, could bring a diety down to the
202 muck of its own creation.
203   We know know much of the anatomy of grief, and have some vocabulary with
204 which to speak of it.  We know that the emotion runs across a spectrum from
205 mildest melancholy to the black depths of grief-induced depression that often
206 ends in death.  We have charted the progressions of loss, the numb despairing
207 feeling brought by unexpected knowledge, the rejection --"No! It can't be true!"
208 -- the feelings of pain and rage, and the slow, slow process of healing.  We
209 can chart the course of the soul through the storm of grief, but we cannot help
210 the soul progress.
211   The piper, racked by powerful waves of emotion that he could not understand,
212 moved farther into the forest, seeking solitude.  Sobbing and stumbling,
213 clothes and skin scratched and torn, he made his way through the indifferently
214 lighted forest.  The sun had long since left the sky, its place taken by the
215 wan, cool, moon.  
216   Deep within the forest, light seldom penetrates.  Thousands of eager leafy
217 branches hold out their leaves, seeking the golden photons of the sun as
218 beggars in an overcrowded city seek alms.  Even midday sun hardly reaches 
219 the floor of the forest, the wealth of light reduced to a mere trickle.
220 Night on the forest floor is a blackness that is almost a thickness in the
221 throat, something with substance that takes an effort to breath.  You can
222 move through this blackness, unseeing, for the thickness of the forest's
223 canopy makes the spaces beneath the trees nearly free of undergrowth, but
224 the ropy twine of roots across the forest floor, the occasional hole filled
225 with loose duff that gives beneath the unwary step, and the looming boles of
226 the trees waiting to strike bruising blows in gh
227 (oops ch /gh/the) darkness make travel hazardous at best.
228   This stygnian darkness is sometimes releived for a brief space of time where
229 one of the forest monarchs has fallen, sometimes taking a neighbor with himself.
230   These brief-lived clearings quickly fill with light-loving plants until some
231 young sapling can establish itself as the heir of the fallen monarch and reach
232 to the canopy and fill the empty space.  It was such a clearing, just filling
233 with vegatative tribute to the fallen monarch, into which the piper stumbled.
234 
  Falling on his knees before the moon glowing like a great silver coin in the
235 sky, blood trailing blackly from cuts and scratches on his face and body,
236 the piper reached up clawed fingers as if to tear the moon from the sky --
237 tensed muscles defined sharply under the abused skin -- the piper turned his
238 tear-wet face to the sky and howled a pure animal sound of pain and rage.

243 I am sorry somewhat felt they had to remove my Voyage story from above. It had
244 resided starting on or about line 40. I was set to upload part II today, but
245 instead I will upload part I again. I can't understand why it was deleted, 
246 certainly there was no material contained therein that could be contrued as
247 insulting or malicious. But perhaps my mores are different than the rest of
248 you, so I will let you decide.

251                                Voyage 
252                                Part 1
253 
254         The sun, now high in the sky, beat down on the landscape below with
255 its incessant drumming of heat. No portion of the parched surface could
256 escape the onslaught. Shadows ceased to be at this time of day, the land was
257 flat and the few outcroppings of rock pointed straight upwards, accusing
258 fingers in the direction of their torment.
259 
260         It was into this Hell-incarnate the Earth ship Sahara landed, or
261 rather was forced to land. A world, a solid place to stand, was still
262 preferable to death in the icy black void of space, or so the crew of
263 Sahara thought. It was a small solar system; a lone arid planet between
264 two class G stars in a near circular 3-body orbit roughly 160 million miles
265 in diameter; that the crew was forced to land. Of course Sahara had little
266 real choice in the matter. It was land on the planet, or become one with
267 the ether of outer space, a victim of a malfunctioning ion-star drive.
268 
269         Dry Gulch the crew had called it, when their humor, and their
270 supplies had been more plentiful. The men and women handling the touchdown
271 had done an admirable job, no major injuries resulted from the near dead-stick
272 landing, but Sahara, the once proud ship of the interstellar fleet, would
273 never again mingle with the stars. Good Sahara, even in her space craft
274 death, did not cease to serve those who inhabited her. She became dormitory,
275 kitchen, commons, bedroom, and refuge from the never ending sun. She was
276 the only place Man could live on this planet, as the final fly-by scans
277 just prior to landing confirmed. Sahara was the single place on the planet
278 where night could exist in day.
279 
280         The never-ending sun, the never-ending day. Dry Gulch had no night,
281 for as the planet hurtled through space, and one star set and rose, the other
282 star rose and set. It was a cosmological oddity, a single planet trapped
283 in the clutches of a binary star system, never without the full force of
284 a burning furnace in the sky. There were no seasons, no dark side to
285 escape to. There was only Sahara, and the cover, the habitat she could
286 offer.
287 
288         Before the crash, Sahara's crew had managed to jettison a rescue
289 beacon that would circle the planet in a semi-elliptic orbit, broadcasting
290 stellar position and other pertinent information on the interstellar fleet's
291 emergency space channels. The little beacon was visible only in the bright
292 blood red sky that occurred when Alpha, as the first star was dubbed, was
293 setting, and Beta, the 'other', was rising. It became the survivor's biggest
294 game, predicting when it would appear, since the gravitational tides of the
295 solar system slightly affected its orbit, and its appearance in the sky could
296 not be accurately charted. It also reminded them of their rescue, not the
297 possibility, but the real event. Their plight could never be thought of as
298 hopeless, since to lose hope would be to lose their reason for living.
299 Survival in the hull of their grounded ship was difficult enough. The added
300 mental anguish of an existence without the hope of rescue would be too much
301 for the survivors to bear. Life was a tenuous grip on the planet's hellish
302 surface. The thought of rescue served to tighten that grip, and helped them
303 endure those first few weeks.

376 To the Hater: Personally I hate strawberries.

378 It's good to see the Inn a bit more like the old Inn, not like it was when
379 I was here for spring break.  Now I only have a week before I return to
380 Tacoma to work, and I fear I shall miss all the new authors.  Keep up the
381 GREAT work.

386 Oh I don't like to sit and wait,
387  it's such a bore,
388  when is she going to come through that door?
389 It's probably me who is late.
390 ----------
391 I love to walk in the forest on a summers day.
392  Streams that cut a path,
393  so settlers can unleash their never ending wrath.
394 Now where are all the forests? On days like this I pray...

398 There was laughter in the back of the cathedral during the Mass
399 for the Dead ...
400 
401 There were looks of disgust from the families of the long-time
402 members of the parish.
403 
404 "Who does he think he is!" ... "This is a solumn occasion!"
405 ... "He should be horse-whipped!"
406 
407 The giggling continued.
408 
409 A member of the family got up from his seat and walked to
410 the back of the church.
411 
412 "If you don't be quiet I'll have you removed." he hissed.
413 The young man, eyes shining, only laughed louder.
414 "Why would you do that?", the man asked?
415 "Because ..." the family's man said "Your being disrespectful
416 in our grief!"
417 
418 The young man's eyes turned cold. "Disrespectful to YOUR
419 grief!?"
420 "Yes, you mock our dead by your laughter... our brethern
421 is gone from us and we grieve."
422 
423 The young mans eyes again shined.
424 "Which is better?" He asked. "To shed your pain and 
425 remember you brother as he wished to be remembered ... or
426 to trap oneself in a cycle of self-stroking prattle that
427 means nothing to the dead?"
428 
429 The family man was lavid ... but he had no answer.
430 By this time the service had stopped, and the entire
431 congregation was looking over their shoulders at the
432 confrontation.
433 The family man returned to his seat and tried to focus
434 himself into the ritual of death. The rest of the family
435 members followed his lead.
436 Most succeeded, but the family man couldn't get the view
437 of the laughing young man out of his mind.
438 
439 A small victory for life...

449 short time lurker:
450 as to the sound of the bells, about 3 maybe 4 years ago there was this
451 thing about "bells". It went on for the longest time...The themes of 
452 the inn were different also. Soon after, i lost acess to a terminal
453 keeping me away until about 3 mo's ago.  Have things ever changed!!

457 Things realy ARE (in the last 100 or so lines) picking up!
458 Voiage Pt 1: Supurb! What Leonard said was well intentioned and USUALY the case
459 such untoward things DO occasionaly happen, thats why you see that 'enter only'
460 message so much of the time.
461 Hater: The main thing I hate is hate itself and I'M an enthusiest of alt world
462 too.  
463 Piper: you REALY say it, as per usual excelance.  I wonder though, that primal
464 scream in the woods; might (not too likely but a fun story idea) draw the 
465 curios attention of a community of social carnivores.  Said four footed ones
466 might become close companions.  I know your usualy a 'solo' writer but what if
467 certain four footed friends of mine were to cautiosly approach? ...
468 BSAL: long time no see.

474                      Surf and Sun  
475 
476       A lone figure sits looking out to the sea.
477      What thoughts, what turbulance passes within?     
478      The calming rush of the surf erases the pain,
479  Until it becomes but a bad nightmare to be forgotten.
480 What deep dark thoughts are these that need to be lost?
481      What magic does this surf have to ease them?
482 
483          All to soon the sun reaches its pass,
484              And sets in a blaze of glory.
485      The flaming torrents of red, gold, and brown
486    Leave a shimmering picture from natures palette.
487         A final gift from the life giving sun,
488       as the long day draws once more to a close.
489 
490      The lone figure seems to shiver at its loss.
491  Is it only the chill of the wind, or something more?
492          And as a shadow, I sit there as well, 
493           Watching the the suns final grace.
494        For in my dreams I am there with my love,
495         Sharing the sun's spectacular embrace.

559 there should be licenses for modems?  How about a training school for repeat

561 irresponsible, but I do tire of twits...and they all are 15 or 16.  Kids,

598 ^   When time passes on very little really ever changes.  The more
599 ^   we want for there to be a change, the more we cling on to the 
600 ^   things that were once ourselves.  I know.  Believe me, I know.
601 ^   When once there was a bond, but now you feel that there is none,
602 ^   you wake up one morning to find that it has somehow grown stronger
603 ^   in your lack of paying it any mind.  You feel the freedom (or
604 ^   misery) seep back over your mind when the bond has desolved.
605 ^   Time makes you feel more at ease with yourself for ever having
606 ^   allowed the entropy to have set in; you no longer worry about
607 ^   the where or the why from which the state of decay has dragged
608 ^   you down.  Things begin to fall back into place, routines may
609 ^   once again be fallen into like the ruts they really have been.
610 ^   Then that morning comes.
611 ^   You awake to the rise of Helios' next journey on that blazing
612 ^   chairiot and all appears to be normal.  The stars fade in the
613 ^   light of a new dawn.  You turn your mind to the tasks that
614 ^   always seem to be so important in the morning but never is when
615 ^   never are when you take a closer look later on.  You then 
616 ^   proceed to your daily course of activities.  Everything is calm,
617 ^   or at least gives that impression.
618 ^   Then the mailman comes.
619 ^   You know his face but the name always manages to slip your mind
620 ^   when you want to give a greeting and thanks for the efforts he
621 ^   has expended in order to keep you in touch with the rest of the
622 ^   outside world.  You don't notice the letter that sits in the middle
623 ^   of the pile but it patiently waits for you to open it.  No matter how
624 ^   little yo think you care, the name jumps out at you and sends your
625 ^   figures to tearing open the envelop.  Then you see what you had wished
626 ^   for all along.  They are there.
627 ^   Words.
628 ^   In those words is reborn the love that had once been shared.        >G
