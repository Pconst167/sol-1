24   
25      Heartbeats tolled the passing of time.  In the drizzle of the misty
26 spring rain stands a small crowd of people lost from this world we know
27 only as Inisfal.  A distance from Inisfal Proper is where I now kneel.
28 This is my story, and it is past due to finish that which I have started.
29 To some I am known only as the Guardian; that is not important, I have
30 lapsed in that duty for some two years now.  Yet I am the Guardian.
31 
32      I am kneeling in a secluded glen.  The trees that surround this
33 opening are thin and scattered widely, though it is their great number that
34 separates us from the world.  The dampness of the forest floor seeps
35 through my leggings, I have been here so long and I am sore.  The glen is
36 quiet and I remain motionless.
37   
38      There stands before me a young man, his back is turned on me.  Hands
39 have been turned to fists, rage swells within him over a matter he does not
40 understand.  His eyes are not open, within his consciousness is only aware
41 that I am behind him, a symbol of failure in that I hold his brother --
42 shot with my arrow.  To him I am dead, yet still a burden on his mind.
43 
44      "I hate you for what you have done, and nothing will change that,"
45 come the words to me as they drift over his shoulder.
46   
47 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     --->the Guardian     (125:08)

49 And now I leave this wonderful town for the week.  Upon my return I dearly
50 hope to have more to the conclusion of my story.  Until my trek is over,
51 fare thee well stout travelers.

68 Innkeeper:  If my aid is not welcome, I will not feel hurt.  I would just like
69 to know.  I can understand your hesitation, but not knowing makes it
70 even worse.  One need only say that they do not want me, perhaps they might
71 give a little reason why.  I want to try to improve, but it is difficult when
72 I am not able to help the story and show my improvments.  As you can see, for
73 the most part I have eliminated the annoying characters that jhkept getting
74 into the works.  (I hope.)  Occasional typos nonwithstanding, the line noise
75 is gone.  Perhaps, if I may, I could try to write something, but I am unsure.
76 I want to explore, to know that someone actually thinks about what I write.
77 Even that little gesture that tells me "No." in a simple message would be
78 enough.  Or, even better, that little gesture that says "Yes." though, from
79 past experience, I doubt that there are any who are willing to let me try 
80 again.  I''m just asking, but if there are no people here who feel I can
81 do better given the chance, then that is perfectly fine with me, and I am
82 sorry for taking up the space on the board for the good writers.

137 Dreams and visions assaulted me, but I no longer felt the small pain in my
138 back.  Instead, scenes flowed into view, then drained away leaving a dark
139 grey universe around me.
140 I saw a place of chaos, in which the Innkeeper pounded upon a door.  Before I
141 could call out, he and the door vanished, leaving the chaos only.
142 I saw the common room of the Inn, with dozens of merry Inngoers ingaged in talk
143 and storytelling.  The view was from a position in the room approximating that
144 of the mysterious door.  This scene faded out just as the other had.
145 I saw a jigsaw, a large puzzle which lay complete except for a solitary piece,
146 which was located nearby.  Somehow, the piece did not seem to fit into the 
147 space it was intended for.  As I watched, the piece slowly changed shape,
148 approaching the form required to fit into the jigsaw.  Its progress was slow,
149 but nonetheless constant.  The puzzle faded from view as had the others.
150 From far off I heard someone calling to me, as if whispering my name softly.
151 The visions caught me and I could make  no response.  I strove to locate the
152 voice, but to no avail.
153 The chaos withdrew, and left me again in the grey universe.  Then a stinging
154 slap brought me from the roaming of strange planes.
155 Moments later I rediscovered my eyelids, and opened them to gaze upon those
156 people around me.
157 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Milchar +++++++++++ May 6, 1987 at 6:15pm +++++++
158 	Bard was startled as the 'window' collapsed. Turning towards the
159 others, he saw the reason. Milchar was slumped on the floor, his cards 
160 spilling from his hand.
161 	Cragmore was already kneeling beside him. It was just as well.
162 Bard was all too well aware of his lack of knowledge when it came to the
163 care of mages. He turned to the device that was still attached to the
164 door.
165 	In a matter of moments, he had more than Milchar to worry about.
166 The readings made no sense whatsoever. The persona lock had confirmed that
167 it was indeed the Innkeeper, but he'd been too busy to do more than set
168 all sensors on record.
169 	The readings for the area up to the door were about as he expected
170 some odd readings, but nothing extraordinary. And as usual, the door itself
171 didn't exist as far as the sensors were concerned. At least that was the
172 case before they'd started.
173 	The door still didn't *really* register, but it's effects on the
174 energies directed at it did! Unfortunately, that wasn't much help without
175 much better gear than he had any hopes of getting to.
176 	The "other side" was the real surprise. Except for the readings
177 that registered the Innkeeper's "aura" (soul?, ka?, no one had ever really
178 figured out what a persona detector detected, just that it was unique to
179 a given individual), the readings were best described as sheer chaos.
180 	No readings, impossible readings, contradictory readings.
181 All at the same time. As if there wasn't really anything there? Or perhaps
182 as if something was *trying* to be there...

187 The man in the dark suit with the red flower in the lapel stood up.  He
188 was even more elegant standing; he was wiry and graceful and looked at
189 Hammond with merry brown eyes.  "I am Feril," he said.  "You come with
190 me now." He smiled widely and bowed at the waist.
191 Hammond was charmed by his mannerly guest. "Greetings, Feril.  I am de-
192 lighted to make your acquaintance."  Hamm thrust out his hand and the
193 stranger took it, still smiling.  "But, alas, my financial committee 
194 awaits in the board room.  Let's reschedule at a more convenient..."
195 The handshake strengthened into a hard grip and the dark eyes turned 
196 melancholy.  "You come with me now."  In his other hand was a knife
197 whose sharp sinuously curved blade was covered with ornate carving. Hamm
198 could see some kind of gems set into the handle.  "Turkish?" He was so
199 intrigued by its medieval appearance that he reached for it and Feril
200 neatly slashed the buttons from his cuff.  "Greek, maybe," he murmured
201 putting his hand in his pocket.  How the devil had he gotten in?  Prob-
202 ably charmed security.  Hamm made a mental note to tighten up on Inter-
203 marine National Security (whose logo, "I.N. Security" was almost as 
204 good as his own, "HA!").  Feril released him from the captive handshake
205 but kept his curious weapon pointed just under the ribs. He had filled
206 Hamm's backpack and now thrust it at him. "You come with me now." He
207 was all business.  As they left by the back, Feril thrust a small alarm
208 clock, several ballpoint pens, and a mechanical pencil into the pack.
209 Halfway down the stairs he paused and broke into a smile again. "I am
210 Feril!" he asserted happily.
211 Hamm was to learn that this was the extent of his English, but his son
212 the driver of the ancient International step-van waiting below knew
213 considerably more. "'Allo,'Allo, you are Hammond Armour the car man.
214 Don't forget your bike."  He chattered at Feril in a language unrecogni-
215 zable to Hamm and Feril hoisted the old black bike easily into the van.
216 "I am Lapo, Feril's son."  He smiled and trained an enormous pistol on
217 Hammond. "Please to relax.  But don't go away.  We will explain."

265 prankster.  I hope that you keep writing.  When I called on Friday the
266 system said "All Is Allowed" or something like that, which I think
267 means that somebody figured out some of the secret commands and
268 started messing with the first few entries.  But, in keeping with the
269 childishness of the "dirty words", the person's attention span was

279 It had apparently been some time since I came out of the Inn, for a 
280 new dawn was breaking.  I turned my face to the new sun and saw a
281 playful cat in the clouds.  The thought struck me that this was
282 somehow connected to the current problem I was researching.  I 
283 didn't know how, but it was related.

292      The Inn's door opened slightly. A draft of hot air slipped in 
293 seeking out the cool corners and sheltered cracks.  A fluttering of 
294 brightly coloured cloth followed the hot draft quickly closing the 
295 aged door. Were there anyone there to see they would have thought 
296 that she seemed out of place. 
297      The flashing colours of her flowing robes seemed odd for one 
298 who hid in shadows and searched out a place where others could not 
299 readily see her. But there were few to see her, and those that were 
300 present paid no attention to her as she quietly moved to a small 
301 booth with a table. 
302      She laid a bag whose material matched that of her clothing on 
303 the table and began to search inside. After a short moment her hand 
304 withdrew holding a small packet of cards. No expression betrayed her 
305 as she began to shuffle the cards...in...out...in...out...in...out...
306      She looked over her left shoulder at the door in the rear where 
307 the others were at. It was the reason they did not see her enter. 
308 There was much concern and fear eminating from all of them. All of 
309 it directed at the glowing door and something beyond. One mentioned 
310 something about an Innkeeper. 
311      It was the immense energy outpourings from the people and from 
312 this Inn itself that brought her here. Something was happening and 
313 she needed to know what. Looking one more time at the strangely 
314 glowing door, she turned back to her cards which she had laid out as 
315 she watched the door and those around it. 
316      The cards had been laid in a particular pattern familar to 
317 those who knew of such things. She looked at the first card...
318 great upheaval...great change showed on the face of that card.  The 
319 next card showed loss, and the next destruction. Each card in its 
320 turn showed grave danger, and impending doom. 
321      She had been avoiding it until now, but she now looked at the 
322 final and telling card... 
323      A quick intake of breath, her hand came up to her throat in a 
324 defensive gester, and the colour drained from her face. Even the 
325 bright colours in hers clothes seemed to fade slightly. 
326      That card should not be there. She had taken it out of the deck 
327 long ago for fear that it might some day be drawn and she would have 
328 to face it. Yet there it was in the primary position. The reading 
329 she had always feared. 
330      For a moment she only looked at the card eyes wide in gathering 
331 fear. Then she was up, running for the door, leaving her few 
332 belongings on the table behind.  She threw the door open and raced 
333 outside, not bothing to take the time to close it.  Running on down 
334 the path and across a small foot bridge. 
335      Racing as quickly as she could down the rutted packed dirt 
336 road. Trying to outrun it even as she knew that she could not, for 
337 the reading had shown what she had always feared.  The end was at 
338 hand. Not just the end of an individual, not the end of many, or 
339 even the world, but the end of life itself, of the universe. The end 
340 of everything. And she could not outrun it, no one could, but she 
341 ran on anyway, dwindling into a small flashing red spot in the 
342 distance.

344 (* IIIIIIIVVVIVIIVIIIIX (*) IXVIIIVIIVIVIVIIIIII *)
345      T'Chree and the Dancer were quick to settle the details of their
346 business arrangement.  Both were anxious to leave the Inn, though for
347 very different reasons.  T'Chree had been on her search for several
348 months and wanted to return to her home and family.  The Dancer was
349 still uneasy about the suspicious interest being shown by some of the
350 Inn patrons into her connections with the old Crone, and the old
351 woman's disappearance--to say nothing about the man she had been
352 running from when she arrived at the Inn the first time.  She had not
353 seen him, but that was no guarantee that he had given up his pursuit.
354      T'Chree gathered together her belongings.  She gently awoke her
355 young servant, Yuan, who had been sleeping, nestled in her cloak.  He
356 got up and stood leaning sleepily against the bench, eyes barely open.
357      "Here, let me carry him," offered the Dancer.  She picked him up,
358 surprised by how little he weighed.  He snuggled close, wrapped his
359 arms around her, and promptly went back to sleep.  Trusting little
360 soul, aren't you? the Dancer thought with a smile, and brushed the top
361 of his feathered head with her cheek.  She nodded at T'Chree to show
362 she was ready to leave.  The Princess led the way out of the Inn--
363 their departure unnoticed by the rowdy Inn patrons who were watching
364 some goings-on at the back of the room.
365      A short distance from the Inn, concealed by mooncast shadows,
366 T'Chree stopped.  "This spot is as good as any." she told the Dancer.
367      The Dancer looked around for some vehicle or other means of
368 transportation but could see nothing.  When she turned back again to
369 T'Chree, she saw the woman removing a small packet from the bodice of
370 her tunic.  Opening the packet, she removed a small, dark feather
371 which glistened even in the darkness.
372      Holding the feather up so that the Dancer could see it clearly,
373 T'Chree said, "This is another element of the old life of my people
374 which is becoming forgotten--the Wise Ones.  The Wise Ones were our
375 rulers before the change.  They had many great and subtle powers which
376 they used to better the lives of our people.  Their orders were obeyed
377 without question for the people knew that the Wise Ones would never
378 harm them."
379      "You said they were being forgotten." the Dancer responded.  "Do
380 you mean that they died when the change occurred?"
381      "No," answered T'Chree.  "They foresaw the growth that my people
382 would undergo, the increased intelligence and independence which would
383 develop.  They felt that their absolute control would only hold us
384 back--keep us from achieving the ability to make our own decisions,
385 and to learn by the mistakes we would make.  They waited until the
386 evolution process had progressed to a point where we had a degree of
387 autonomy and the ability to survive as a society, then they just left-
388 -disappeared into the unknown.  Someday we hope that they will
389 return."  She stared wistfully at the feather she was twisting slowly
390 between her fingers.
391      "That however is a quest for the future.  Right now, we must
392 complete the one we are on, with the assistance of this gift from the
393 Wise Ones.  This feather allows travel between planets, and
394 dimensions, and probably to and from other things which we haven't
395 even discovered yet.  The Wise Ones left several to be "found" when we
396 had progressed sufficiently.  The feathers are only a few of the
397 "gifts" left us by the Wise Ones, but you will learn of the others in
398 due time.
399      Now, take my hand, and we will make the brief journey to Aviana.
400 Oh, by the way, do you have a name?"  T'Chree looked questioningly at
401 the woman standing beside her.  "It would be a bit awkward to
402 introduce you to the King as merely 'Dancer'."
403      "While I am visiting your world," replied the Dancer, "you may
404 call me Ahmryaba."

410 I was walking back to the Inn, puzzling over the image of a cat
411 that had appeared in the sky, knowing that it was somehow related
412 to the dancer, the old hag, and now that overbearing pompous
413 thing that called herself T'Chree.  
414 "Silly name", I thought to myself, "It sounds like a screech a
415 bird would make."
416 I was wandering across the bridge in my revery, when I was nearly 
417 knocked into the water by a woman in a very bright costume.  
418 "Umph", was my only response, but she kept right on running, as
419 though the devil himself were after her.
420 As I sat feeling a little put out about the rudeness of some people,
421 I saw that dancer and that creature step out of the doorway and
422 head for the woods.  I made my way to follow them, quietly 
423 going around the back, and into the woods.

434 WHO CARES?
435 :::::=====:::::=====
436 Friar:  If you mean fishing for compliments, then I'm not fishing for them.
437 I am fishing for a chance.  It was a    chance I was never given, as most of
438 my work was originally ignored, and I
439 have not been able to show my work for  some time.  Now, I ask for a chance,
440 and only a chance.
441 Someone suggested I write my own work   first.  Very well.
442 :::::=====:::::=====
443      After the encounter with Zeb (a    different Zeb than Piper's, to be
444 sure), Focusing and Magnifying had been Zephuryr's life, and, more importantly,
445 his only current livlihood.  That was   why he had offered to help those who
446 stood at the mtysterious doorway.  The   scent of adventure had filled his 
447 still-sensitive nostrils, nbut alas, the assembled group had been too busy
448 speaking amongst themselves to take     notice of his offer of service.
449      He pulled his hat down over his    head and sat back at his table.  W
450 Obviously, his first attempt at simple  human-human conversations had not 
451 worked as planned.  Having only been    human for a very short while, Zephyr   
452 only expected as much.  In time, perhaps, but not now.
453      Now he had more important things    to worry about.  It looked as though
454 tthose at the Inn were beginning to      filter out.  Friar had vanished, and   
455 a lovely young woman wearing very bright clothing had come and gone in an
456 instant.  Zephyr hadbeen painfully     aware of her presence, with the power
457 of Focusing working subconciously, he   did not like the magnified colors very  much.
458      Then there were those at the door, but they had ignored his presence.
459 As he looked at them, they seemed to    stanfd like immobile statues.  He felt
460 like a twig on a log about to be swept  away by the breeze standing so near
461 them.  Somehow, he knew that they were  the nexus of this place that he had
462 always sensed byut had never been able   to research.
463    Magnifying the meal he had purchased into four, he pcarefully packed them
464 away in his leatx`her pouch and had two   glasses of ale, after magnifying one.
465 Fortunately, he could avoid Focusing    the affects of the alcohol on his
466 system.  He needed no repeats of the    night he had lost control of his
467 abilities due to foreign substances.
468      This world definitely didn't need  eighteen moons.

487 I came upon them in a clearing, talking quietly about an object T'Chree
488 was holding.  It looked like a bird feather.
489 "I thought she looked and talked a little flighty", I chuckled to myself
490 at the pun.  "Flighty ?  They are going to try to get out of here!  And
491 after murduring, or who knows what, the old hag."  
492 "You there, hold !", I shouted.  "You aren't going anywhere."
493 I ran into the clearing, and jumped, trying to catch both of them.  I
494 tripped on a branch, and fell.  When I looked up, they were gone.  I don't
495 know how, just gone.
496 "Damn."  
497 I picked myself up and headed back for the Inn.  Maybe the other crew was
498 having better luck.  Or maybe my friend the Philosopher had thought of a
499 new tack I should take.

567 Time Winds Tavern (words: Teri Lee, music : "Those were the Days")
568 
569 Once upon the time winds was a tavern
570 Where strange folk could have a drink or two,
571 Reminding us of their immortal wonder,
572 I saw a unicorn there, didn't you?
573 CHORUS:	Those days are gone, my friend;
574 	The need is at an end
575 	Of all those strange and mystic beasts of yore.
576 	The dragon's gone tonight; he went without a fight
577 	And left us here with science evermore.
578 Unicorns sat perched upon the bar stools,
579 Dragons parked their tankards on the floor,
580 Orcs and griffins fought for lovely maidens,
581 While imps and demons traded arcane lore.
582 	Chorus
583 Witches once worked spells upon the tavern
584 To guard it from the sight of human eyes,
585 For mortals must not seek to know their betters;
586 What man can know the future and not cry?
587 	Chorus
588 In the dark alone I sit and wonder,
589 Will they come and drink with us again?
590 The tavern waits in sawdust covered splendor
591 To be filled with laughing creatures, who knows when?
592 	Chorus

595 tell him something.

604 I went through the door into the Inn. Things seemed awry.  The bard
605 was looking pensive, and there seemed to be a mood of lethargy about
606 the place.   I sat down at my usual table and waited.  What was going
