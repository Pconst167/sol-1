20 d: Two entries in the same week! What do we owe this fantastic outflow?
21 Please don't go so long again, two to three months between entries
22 is far too long. Why, some people here come and go within that amount
23 of time, never even knowing of your existance, let alone experience your
24 entries for themselves.
25 In reading your message on db, I notice a missing line, sigh, it seems

28 FRIAR TUCK: HOW NICE TO FIND, AMONG THE CLIQUISH BICKERING, INSULTING, AND 
29 PUT DOWNS THAT CHARACTERIZE BWMS, ONE WHO ENJOYS A STIMULATING CONSTRUCTIVE 
30 VARBAL JOUST!. HAVE AT THEE!. MAYHAPS THE ART OF CONVERSATION IS NOT DEAD! 
31 METHINKS YOUR CONCEPT OF A MULTI-GOVERNMENT IS INTRIGUING, BUT (PRAGMATIST 
32 THAT I AM), IMPRACTICAL. CONSIDER THE MIND BOGGLING COMPLEXITY, THE RAMPANT 
33 APATHY, AND INEFFICIENCY, THE $16,000.00 THE PENTAGON SPENDS EVERY DAY JUST 
34 FOR PAPER CLIPS. ( THEY SHOULD HIRE VEET VOOJAGIG TO LOOK INTO THIS) THIS IS
35 THE NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM-SIX MILLION TONS OF PAPERWORK GENERATED EVERY YEAR. 
36 (IN MY FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT EXPERIENCE, I HAVE LEARNED TO APPRECIATE 
37 THIS). TO TRY TO DIVEST THIS BYZANTINE LABYRINTHE INTO SEPERATE GOVERNMENTS 
38 WOULD SO DEBILITATE THE TOTTERING THREE BRANCH STRUCTURE WE HAVE, AS TO PLAC
39 E IT AT THE MERCY OF ANY OF A NUMBER OF BETTER ORGANIZED, ALBEIT DOGMATIC, 
40 GROUPS-EG, THE "TRIBUNAL" AS DESCRIBED BY ONE "DO RUN" ON THE LAST DISC, OR,
41 PERHAPS, THE HARPER VALLEY PTA.
42 THE AT&T DIVESTITURE IS (ON A SMALL SCALE) EXEMPLARY OF THIS CONCEPT: SURE 
43 AT&T WAS A MONOPOLY, BUT-THE SHERMAN ANTI-TRUST ACT NOT WITHSTANDING, IT WAS
44 A GOOD MONOPOLY. LOOK AT YOUR PHONE BILL, AND THEN TRY TO FIND FAULT WITH 
45 THIS. DO YOU PLAY CHESS, FRIAR? LITTLE JOHN. LJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJLJL

52 P.S.  Frank, there is a child abuse hotline in Portland.  I can't find

82 Hmph ugg ouch...OK...you try switching realities without rumpling your
83 trenchcoat!
84 The delightful visit from d was indeed a welcome sight to the weary eyes of
85 the inn-goers.
86 "Dear lady, I must too apologize for my words, but not my content. I have
87 seen so many messages concerning "Gee...how crummy Back Water has become",
88 when there is a real effort by several of the patrons to improve things."
89 After exhuming my foor from its usual place when not resting on the floor,
90 I see what your objections were. Joshua and I talked at length about that
91 turn of events in the McKane story. We both agreed it was certainly a
92 different path, but in our boorish male ways, we (hope you don't mind
93 all of this joshua) failed to see how this most likely innocent message
94 could be taken as an insensitive entry againt women. Again I apologize.
95 And may I also say thank you for questioning our entries and making us
96 more aware and hopefully more thoughtful about any future entries. Please
97 don't be too put off by our actions. Maybe it was the Ale???
98 %$#%^&%^$$^
99 McKane story buffs: What has happened...Three days with only one or two
100 entries. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come. By the way, I have
101 managed to gather and edit one large file containing ALL messages
102 pertaining to the McKane storyline. So far, as of 7/11/84, the file is
103 slightly over 80k. If anyone has missed some of the story, or would like
104 a hardcopy, or would like the file, I may be able to help out. CP/M, IBM PC,
105 and TRSDOS operating systems are the easiest, but I can also handle Apple
106 DOS. As far as commodore goes, that may be too much to ask, unless the
107 commodore end has a GOOD terminal program that doesn't care how long the
108 incoming file is. I DO support XMODEM and XON/XOFF protocals if I can't write
109 the disk directly. Just in case anyone is interested... silence

118 INTERESTING. WHENEVER A GIRL/WOMAN/FEMALE (SEMANTICS) LOGS ON, EVERYONE 
119 IMMEDIATELY THROWS THEMSELVES AT THEIR FEET. PERHAPS THE REASON FOR THE 
120 INFREQUENT ENTRIES BY THESE LADIES IS THAT THEY WISH TO BE ACCEPTED AS 
121 JUST PEOPLE, WITHOUT ALL THIS ATTENTION TO THEIR ANATOMY. COMMENTS WELCOME.
122 THIS GUY FRANK- I DO NOT BELIEVE HE IS FOR REAL, FOR SEVERAL REASONS D'ETRE:
123 1. ANYONE WHO HAS STUDIED THE HABITS OF PEDOPHILES WOULD FIND IT VERY 
124 HARD TO BELIEVE 'FRANK' HAS HAD THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ONLY A FEW YOUNG BOYS
125 IT IS NOT PLAUSIBLE. 
126 2. HE SAYS THAT HE DID NOT SOLEY INITIATE THESE RELATIONSHIPS, AND THAT IT 
127 WAS MUTUAL. BOLOGNA. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. THINK ABOUT IT. 
128 3. FRANK SAYS HE "RUNS" A BOY SCOUT TROOP. IF THIS WERE TRUE, HE WOULD, BY 
129 ALL ODDS, HAVE BEEN 'DISCOVERED' BY NOW, IN WHICH CASE, HE WOULD NOT BE 
130 WRITING TO "DEAR SYSOP". ONE WHO IS A SCOUTMASTER "LEADS" HIS TROOP, HE DOES
131 NOT "RUN" IT. A TRUE SCOUTMASTER(AND I HAVE BEEN ONE) WOULD NEVER USE THE 
132 TERM "RUN". ERGO: "FRANK" IS NOT FOR REAL. I FEEL VERY WARM INSIDE FOR ALL 
133 OF YOU WHO OFFERED HIM HELP. I FEEL VERY COLD TO ALL OF YOU WHO PUT HIM DOWN
134 AND I WONDER ABOUT ALL OF YOU WHO COULDN'T IMMEDIATELY REALIZE THAT HE IS 
135 JIVEING YOU. COMMENTS WELCOME.---/---/---/GUEST/---/---/---/---/---/---/---/

142    The piper returned to the main room out of the bathroom.  (It has been
143 disquieting to move from a Roman bath to a midieval inn.)  Brushing a bit
144 of sweet oil from one arm (out of deference to d I will not reveal what
145 really takes place in the men's room) he walked to his place at the table.
146 
147   He picked up his pipes, inflated the bag with two quick breaths, tapped
148 the drones into full sound, then quickly began a tune in honor of the ladies
149 of the company.  He played "The Australian Ladies", "Jenny of the Nut-Brown
150 Skin", and "Queen Victoria's Jubilee."

166   Well, if the quality of the story lines ( such as my own ) are still lousy,
167 at least the reading is getting more interesting.  Secondly, I hate to put
168 my name on something like this, but I and another person on this illustrious
169 system ( who shall remain unnamed ) are introducing our own home grown BBS.
170 When I say home grown, I mean we wrote it.  It will be a simple system, but
171 thi is a simple system, and it is MY favorite.  It will also " Spook 
172 Central ", and run by the ever famous P.A.L.s.  It will be up with one of
173 it's two boards ( don't groan ) sometime this weekend, at the same number
174 as Spook Central now uses ( 635-xxxx ).  Try not to crash it...

176   The Innkeeper looked in mild surprise at the apparition.  Then he r
177 remembered the face, and then proceeded to get out what the man had always
178 had - the cheapest local ale.  When the Innkeeper had poured about half a 
179 glass, the man turned and looked at him.
180   " Thank you so much, but please don't bother.  I have not a penny to my
181 name, and furthermore, it is hard to enjoy cheap ale when one is dead.  "
182   " Oh dear ! ", the Innkeeper said in a silly way...
183 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
184   " It will also be called ..", I belive is the corect line.  Sorry, I am
185 too lazy to make corrections.

256 I hope no one minds, but I started transcribing this song (from
257 an somewhat unintelligible tape) after the msgs regarding Cthulhu
258 a few days ago. 
259 Cthulhu Gone (words & music: Leslie Fish)
260 Where, oh where has Cthulhu gone?
261 None of his lot remain alive
262 They packed up and they fled this world
263 In August 1945
264 
265 Where, oh where are the Old Ones gone?
266 Scrambled back to their darkling lands
267 They have fled with a rare good sense
268 The lightnings held in human hands
269 
270 Gods who followed their politics
271 Wagers on the changing Earth
272 Across the backs of the human breed
273 Never guessed what its brain was worth
274 
275 From flint knives to the flintlock gun
276 Humans leaped while Cthulhu dreamed
277 Atoms cracked in another breath
278 The old god woke at once and screamed
279 
280 Wise, oh wise were the gods who ran
281 Fleeing fast for the depths of space
282 Fiercer demons have come to stay
283 Human powers take their place
284 
285 Down to the nethermost depths of hell
286 You will not find, warns the poet's verse
287 A shape more terrible than this
288 More packed with danger to the universe
289 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
290 The bard sat back and awaited the inevitable reaction.

293 Guest: Your comments are interesting, but for the wrong reason. It is my opinion
294        that the reason the females that occasionaly use BW use it with such
295        grace and style, that you would have to be a total clod to not appreciate
296        it. PAM and d are two of the finest backwater writers I have had the
297        pleasure of reading. You belittle both them and us with your comments.
298 Frank: I imagine your message is merely an attempt to generate some contro-
299        versy here on Back Water. In that respect, you have to some degree
300        succeeded. If it was merely a test of the reactions the general
301        back water user would have if faced with such a person, I think you
302        have probably gotten your money's worth. I notice you chose Back water
303        rather than one of the other 25 or so boards in town. Most likly, your
304        message would have been deleted on any of the other boards. The fact
305        that the reactions to you weren't nearly as strong as some of the
306        reactions to religion, taxes, public schools, and software piracy is
307        also interesting. I agree with guest's apraisel of your entry, and I
308        would be interested in reading your response to his message.
309 Alex:  That sure looks like sunset and 217 to me. But the last time I drove
310        that route on the BBS, I ended up in Amber. Let's hope I do better
311        this time.
312 Aaron: Your visit with MF&E (or is it only M now?) was certainly short. Was
313        that in response to the latest chain of events?
314 Mikey: I imagine we will have your money by the end of this weekend. Our
315        group of four has been enhanced by the addition of Dragon Lady, who,
316        it appears, also owns an '11. I may be able to pay you by the first
317        of next week, if I can get ahold of the elusive Aaron. Wish us luck!

335 WHY SHOULD WE WASTE OUR ENERGIES IN THE PURSUIT OF GARBAGE LIKE
336 YOU. YOU GIVE THE REAL CUTTER JOHN A BAD NAME. CHANGE YOUR NAME
337 TO SOMETHING LIKE POTATOE HEAD, OR SOME OTHER MINDLESS ENTITY, AND
338 LEAVE OUR BULLETIN BOARD IN PEACE. YOUR PRESENCE IS LIKE AN OPEN
339 SORE ON THE SKIN OF HUMANITY. ALL WE NEED NOW IS A GREAT BIG 
340 BANDAID.

343 Cutter John if you don't like the way the board flows why don't you access
344 some other system?
345 Frank like some of the others here I think you made your statement to
346 promote controversy. If what you said is true however I suggest that you
347 seek professional counseling. Children, of either sex don't need to have
348 some adult screw up the rest of their lives.
349 
350 Well folks I've been busy and not acessing the system too much lately. What
351 happened to all the McKane fuss that was on here the last time I checked in.
352 I didn't contribute because I coudn't see how either of My personas would 
353 fit in. Ones too lazy and the other (me) would get chewed up and spit out in 
354 a high tech world and spy trip like you people were on.
355 
356 I'll see a bunch of you Saturday either at the PC&S or at the Risk game.

360 at "[][][][][]" and "***********"! They also went the way of the Xerox.
361  Loam: My encounter with MF&E was truncated because of time limitations;
362 undoubtedly next time I am downtown I will wander by and try to outsmart
363 the magic elevator buttons one last time....
364  dl: I can't contact you on PMS, as Mr. Lesie revoked my usership upon 
365 finding unfavorable comments towards his system's reliability in a private
366 letter to one of my compatriots. Oops, above should read "Mr. Leslie", not
367 "Mr. Lesie", of course. So, please leave me a PRIVATE mesg. on CBBS/PCS at

393 The Doctor was still playing chef in the Dragon Room, when a familiar vibration filled the room.  He turned slightly,
394 and saw his old friend Milchar enter a empty booth.  The Doctor stood up and walked over to that booth.  In almost 
395 pperfect Ambernese, he asked the trenchcoated man what he would like for his 
396 meanl.  Before he realized what he was doing, Milchar answered him in perfect Ambernese.  Milchar then looked up at the 
397 man and asked him where he had learned that language.  The Doctor then asked "You mean you don't recognize your old
398 friend and travelling companion?  Then again, why should you?  I only went through 2 regenerations since I last saw
399 you..."  Milchar's eyes then lit up.  "Doctor!!!  What are you doing here?  I mean working in a place like this is 
400 not exactly your style."  "I realize that, but the Elder Lords finally caught up with me and took back the Tardis."
401 "That's downright rotten!!!!" Milchar exclaimed.  "Well, Milch, what are you doing here???"  Milchar thought for a
402 moment, the started to tell him everything...
403 ????????????????
404 Milchar:  I couldn't resist.  When you said that the man's back was to you, I thought that this was my opportunity
405 to jump in.
406 By the way, thanks for writing that term program for me...I hope it works!!!

417 Doctor:  That's low.
418 To all McKane people: I was relying on someone else to describe the Dragon Room, but since that hasn't happened...
419 +++++++++++++
420 I opened the door and walked into a booth of some sort.  The cook turned, and I thought for a moment that my goose
421 was cooked (sorry).  Then I recognised him.  Doctor!  "Shall we find this McKane person, and continue our journey?
422 I see that the Tardis' Camelion Circuit is operating again, disguising it as a closet is pretty clever."
423 "Yes.  You wouldn't believe the trouble I had calculating the co-ordinates for this spot."  The Doctor turned his 
424 head.  "K-9!", he yells.  "Yes, Master?", comes a voice from what I thought was a garbage disposal.  Obviously, K-9
425 had been through a few regenerations, too.  "Keep guard.  We shan't be long."  And with that, we opened the REAL door
426 to the Dragon Room's main dining hall.
427 Oriental lanterns dimly lit the smoke-filled room, its ceiling low and opressive.  The wooden timbers supporting the
428 roof were carved with intricate designs of ancient gods and deeds long forgotten.  Few people were about, but several
429 caught my eye at once.  The first group was at the door, and some of them seemed familiar... What?  Is that L'homme?
430 The other group of people, about four, were seated at a table near the fountain.  Odd.  The fountain seems to have 
431 gems imbedded in the bottom.
432 The men (and one woman) at the table spoke in low voices, but a few snatches could be made out: "...gotta get 'im for 
433 Sundo...maybe get a good bonus....'ave you seen Loam?  I 'ear that 'es coming here."

459   This is "Petrov" responding to the petty arguments taking place on this 
460 bulletin board.  To "d": I'm sincerely sorry that I offended you.  It will not
461 happen again.  I am well prepared to defend any entry that I have made, but I
462 refuse to do so at this time.  The reason that I access Backwater is to relax
463 and create.  Granted, my style may be rough--but what can you expect from an
464 ignorant teenager?  My interpretation of this system is to allow everyone to
465 write and share their creations/ideas.  I'm not about to justify my every
466 written phrase to save myself from the countless judgments which have already
467 been passed.
468   Congratulations on an eloquent style, d.  I urge you to use your writings for
469 constructive, tactful criticism.  If you feel there is a problem with the system
470 then stay on and add your touch of class.  I, for one, would be pleased to
471 learn from your technique.
472   Once again, however, I inform you of my intentions:  To enjoy Backwater; not
473 to judge, be judged, or to participate in any arguments over which I have no
474 need to concern myself.

478 I wold like to call previos question. Why, when a female shows up, all you
479 guys start to drivel and fall at thier(her)feet?  Whats wrong with you?
480 Its not as if you have to worship them and offer gifts.  How could you
481 give her all this curtesy, when you won't even give it to someone who is 
482 just starting out. If you could, I bet this system would be much better
483 off, don't you "d". And how about all you guys get of the ground and 
484 give me an answer!      
485 No offence to "d" or course.

504      Everyone was looking at me expectantly, so I put on an air of confidence
505 and told Petrov, "To the Dragon Room!"  Hey, there's Always a place called
506 The Dragon Room in chinatowns.  Unfortunately, I momentarily forgot that Petrov
507 was not the regular chinese coolie, but rather a foreigner like myself.
508 He just looked at me and asked, "where's that?"  Trying to save face, I replied,
509 "I think it's just around that corner, and down the street a couple of blocks."
510 Petrov obligingly pulled us to the indicated spot, but of course there was no
511 Dragon Room there.  We wandered around chinatown looking for it, but to no
512 avail.  Finally we bowed to the inevitable, and stopped at a phone booth.
513 While L'homme guarded the rickshaw (and Petrov), I looked in the book.
514 "Hey guys!  Guess what?  We've got a Dragon Palace, Dragon's Lair, Eye of the
515 Dragon, Dragon's Wing, ...in fact, we've got just about every part of the dragon
516 except its room!  I guess I must have been mistaken. Sorry about that."
517 With that feeble cop-out, I returned to the rickshaw, sat down, and looked
518 at the others expectantly.
519      I could tell by the way the others were glaring at me that they didn't
520 appreciate my sense of humor.  Deciding I had better say something useful before
521 the silence became too heavy, I spoke. "Well, several years ago, I knew a hood
522 named Rocky.  His big dream was to stash enough money to be able to quit the
523 racket and go legit.  Last I heard, he had gotten tired of waiting, and sunk
524 what he had into a restaurant in Oklahoma City (that's where his roots were, you
525 see).  Anyway, while looking in the phone book, I found it.  Never a terribly
526 imaginative sort, he bought a restaurant in the middle of chinatown, and called
527 it 'Rocky's Road'. Judging by the size of the ad, he's doing pretty well;
528 must be from the novelty of having a non-chinese food place in the heart of
529 chinatown.  Anyway, I got him out of some problems back then, so he should be
530 willing to help us get a line on McKane.  I'm sure he has kept his contacts
531 active since retiring.  Okay, Petrov, it's two blocks south and five blocks
532 west."  As Petrov pulled us to our new destination, I sat back and wondered if
533 Rocky really would remember all the favors I had done for him.  The main reason
534 he had finally retired was that he had been worked over so well, he was a real
535 mess.  Rumors had it that his mind was a bit confused.  Well, three capable
536 spies should be able to handle one broken-down arm-breaker.
537      Arriving at Rocky's Road, we parked the rickshaw and went in.  When the
538 maitre d' came over to seat us, I told him to tell Rocky that (pause..let's see,
539 what was my name then?) Jonathan Quaid was here to see him.  The maitre d' eyed
540 our less-than-elegant attire sceptically, but disappeared into the back.  After
541 a few moments, he returned and told us to follow him.  As we trailed after him,
542 I quietly suggested to L'homme and Petrov that they be prepared for possible
543 trouble.  Just in case.  I also made subtle signals to L'homme that he should
544 also keep an eye on Petrov.
545      Coming to a door, our guide rapped out a pattern.  At acknowledgement from
546 within, he pushed the door open, stepped back, and said, "please go in, 'gentlemen'."
547 Hoping that the other two were watching our back, I led us in.  Not
548 unexpectedly, the door slammed behind us, and we were face-to-face with several
549 heavily armed men and one scowling Rocky.

552 Contrary to popular belief, it is indeed possible to upload to BW.
553 The previous essay is proof: after uploading it, there was not one correction
554 to make (other than to change some wording). My terminal program has three parameters:
555 prompt string, delay before a line (0-255), delay between characters (0-255).
556 I set the prompt to a space, before line to 75, and between characters to 125.
557 After sending the prompt (hitting the space bar) I had time to hit the 
558 backspace, thus removing it from the text.  While somewhat slow with those delays,
559 it is still faster than typing it in on-line.  Sorry I can't give a definite figure
560 for the duration of the delay; all I have to go by is the 0-255 it offers me.

572 "Why does this always have to happen?", I asked myself as I moved the
573 safety switch to "off" on my concealed to ready-to-go NET-issue automatic
574 1000-round-per-minute hand held gas operated 7.6mm weapon.
575 It was a mexican stand-off in the truest sense of the word. There were
576 four of them, all heavily laden in material, in addition to who must be Rocky.
577 I could see out of the corner of my eye that both joshua and Petrov also had
578 their spy weapons at the ready. Our weapons may be better, but I don't like
579 to dance with a sawed-off 12 gauge pointing in my general direction.
580 The room was silent for what seemed like an eternity. Finally joshua
581 spoke. He chose his words carefully, for one slip-up could result in the
582 bloodiest alley fight Oklahoma City had seen in recent history.
583 "Is this any way to treat an old friend, Rocky? Don't you remember me?"
584 Rocky spoke in a voice that reminded me of the Best of Sidney
585 Greenstreet.
586 "Sure I remember the name. But you...you have certainly changed. If I
587 can even be sure it's you. I have to be carefull you know. The family never
588 forgets its own. And I don't care for underworld retirement benefits."
589 He paused for a moment, then a smile came to his face. Petrov and I
590 glanced at each other, wondering what would happen next.
591 Rocky spoke again, and there was a trace of excitement in his voice.
592 "Do you remember that time, when I asked you for a special favor. I
593 had a tough contract, but you wouldn't help he with the actual dirty work?
594 Do you remember that? Huh? Do ya remember who the contract was on? 'Cause if
595 you do, I'll know for sure you are who you say you are, and the boys here will
596 be happy to set down all this weaponry."
597 Joshua froze, as if his body was making deep seeks into the inner
598 tracks of that quick access storage device called the brain. There were so
599 many people, so many contracts, and it was so long ago. 
600 I could see my concern mirrored in the face of Petrov. Joshua's lips
601 were moving, but nothing was coming out. My pulse quickened as the deadly
602 pause became longer and longer. I could see Rocky's henchmen, who were 
603 obviously as nervous as we were, tighten their hold on their guns.
604 Joshua's voice cut the heavy atmosphere like a hot knife through
605 butter.
606 "Galore! Bones Galore!", joshua spoke with a voice unaccustomed to him.
607 "He was that small time hood who was running a numbers game on the lower south
608 side. The mob didn't like an outsider cutting in on their turf, and they sent
609 you after him. I wouldn't help you because I used to know his sister before
610 he got mixed up with racketerring. What ever happened to him?
611 "Well heh heh," started Rocky, his voice much more at ease now, "he's
612 my cook. I couldn't do it, after what you told me about his sister. I just
613 couldn't do it. It's the only contract I didn't carry through. And I did it
614 as a favor to you. OK boys...you can set that hardware down. These people are
615 friends."
616 I felt as if a huge weight had suddenly been lifted off my shoulders.
617 I switched the safety back to on, and a small click told me that Petrov had
618 done the same.
619 After the usual introductions, we sat down in Rocky's office, and
620 Joshua and I relayed to Rocky as much as we could about McKane considering
621 Petrov was in our midst. Joshua and I took turns telling Rocky our story.
622 Petrov was unusually silent. Perhaps he was taking all of this in, in order
623 to tell it all to McKane. I still didn't trust him, as I knew joshua didn't
624 either. Time would tell the true side of Petrov.
625 Rocky spoke last, as we exited his office in order to get a full meal
626 on the house.
627 "I may be able to help you. Although I am retired from my previous
628 profession, I still have a few contacts. And contacts like mine can be very
629 usefull to you.   *%)@#$*%)#$%*$ L'homme sans parity *$)#*$#)@$*#@)$*@#)$*@#$)@#
