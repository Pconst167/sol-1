113 The acronym CRC stands for Cyclic Redundancy Check.  It's more or less
114 a high-class parity check for data, often used on disk drives and some
115 serial communications.  If you want me to be more specific I can be,
116 but it can get rather boring.
117 	Baud is not an acronym, but a measure of 'the inverse of the
118 shortest time period used in a serial communication link'.'  In effect,
119 it usually means the number of transmitted bits per second, including
120 start bits, stop bits, parity bits, etc.  This name is short for
121 Baudot, which happens to be the name of a 5-bit code that is not used
122 very much today except for some radioteletype links.  It was replaced
123 by ASCII (thank heavens!).
124 *************************
125 Mr. Baudot was a Frenchman (obvious!) who was the first to use a mechanical
126 device for printing characters sent from a distance.  His earliest system
127 used a manually encoded transmission (no keyboard).  As you may note, this
128 is a lot like using BWMS!
129   Here's a good one... what is BCH?
130   And CRC is not an "acronym" in the strictest sense; it is only an
131 abbreviation since it is very hard to pronounce crc (unless you are
132 prolific at some of the Slavic tongues!)

134    C'mon, now!  BCH is easy!!  It obviously stands for Backward
135 Coon Hound!  Let's see something harder...

144 It has been suggested that DES was deliberately made 'solvable' so that
145 the Good Guys (us) could read the transmissions of the Bad Guys (Boris
146 and Natasha)  for some period defined by the delay between us getting
147 supercomputers and them getting supercomputers.  If we choose the
148 RSA methods, which are theoretically unsolvable, WE can't read THEIR
149 messages!

184 
185 Travelling in a long tie strip
186 On a digital trail lookin for the tip
187 I met a strange signal
188 It made me nervous
189 It took me in and made me restless
190 And it said...
191 
192 Do you come from a chip down under
193 Where circuts glow and chips thunder,
194 Can't you hear can't you hear the thunder
195 Well you better zip, you better take cover
196 
197 Getting charged in a chip bank tower
198 It was six-million-volts and full of power
199 I said "Do you speak ASCII?"
200 He detatched me and replied pasky....
201 
202 "I come from a chip down under
203 Where current does flow and ions flunder
204 Can't you hear can't you hear the thunder
205 Well you better zip, you better take cover"
206 
207 Lying in a bin far away
208 With hashed tracks and nothing to say
209 I said to the head "Are you trying to touch me?
210 Because I come from a land called zee aity?"
211 
212 OH!!!!!! Do you come from a chip down under?
213 Where circuts glow and chips plunder,

229 TO ALL:    FM CISTOP MIKEY:        RE SYSTEM CRASHING:
230 ACTUALLY ALTHOUGH IT IS A NICE THOUGHT, THE ACTUAL CRASHING OF THE SYSTEM
231 BY A USER IS NOT A REALISTIC POSSIBLITY. ABOUT THE WORST THAT YOU COULD
232 DO IS TO SYSTEMATICLY GO THROUGH AND DELETE EVERY LINE OF DATA ON THE SYSTEM.
233 WHILE THIS DOES DESTROY THE INFORMATION ON THE SYSTEM, IT HARDLY COMES UNDER
234 THE HEADING OF 'SYSTEMS CRASH'. SOME THINGS OF NOTE ABOUT THE SYSTEM, FIRST
235 THERE IS NO HIGHER LEVEL OPERATING SYSTEM, WHAT YOU SEE HERE 'IS' THE OPERATING
236 SYSTEM! BWMS IS BASED AROUND AN ASSEMBLER LEVEL OPERATING STRUCTURE RUNNING
237 IN EPROM (NO RAM TO DESTROY THE PROGRAM IN) IT USES 8K OF 2708 EPROMS TO DO
238 THIS. IT ALSO USES 1K OF 2114 RAM FOR MISC BUFFERS AND VARIABLES. ALL DATA
239 YOU ENTER IS PLACED ON THE DISK WHEN YOU TYPE A CARRAGE RETURN. THE LAST
240 ENTERED LINE INFORMATION HEADER IS NOT UPDATED UNTIL YOU HIT A CONTROL-C
241 HOWEVER, SO MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS BEFOR HANGING UP. LUCKLY MANY MODEMS
242 WILL SEND A BREAK SIGNAL BEFOR HANGING UP, AND THIS WILL GET YOU OUT OF THE 
243 ENTER MODE AS WELL. FINALLY ASSUMING YOU DO MANAGE TO BLOW THE SYSTEM AWAY
244 WHICH WHILE POSSIBLE IN THEIORY, IN REALITY IT HAS NOT BEEN DONE. EVEN ASSUMING
245 THAT YOU DO MANAGE TO, THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY RESETS ITSSELF WHEN YOU HANGUP
246 THIS IS A HARDWARE FUNCTION, SO IT IS NOT AFFECTED BY ANYTHING YOU DO. SINCE
247 THE SYSTEM RUNS OUT OF EPROM, WHEN THE NEXT  CALLER CALLS IN IT IS BACK IN
248 BUSSINESS. THERE IS ONE OTHER POSSIBLE WAY FOR THE SYSTEM TO CRASH, AND THAT
249 IS A HARDWARE RELATED THING. BASICLY IT CONSISTS OF; IF A POWER LOSS OCCURS
250 AT THE EXACT MOMENT THAT THE SYSTEM IS UPDATING THE SYSTEM STATUS SECTOR ON
251 THE DISK THE CONTROLER 'MAY' DESTROY THAT SECTOR THEREBY PREVENTING THE 
252 INFORMATION FROM BEING OBTAINED. IT WILL SAY DISK ERROR, AND RETURN TO
253 THE COMMAND MODE AS INDICATED BY THE '>' PROMPT. ALSO NOTE THAT UNLIKE OTHER
254 SYSTEMS, SINCE BWMS RUNS OUT OF EPROM WHEN A POWER LOSS OCCURS, BWMS IS 
255 FULLY OPERATIONAL AGAIN UPON THE REAPPLICATION OF POWER. AND SINCE DATA IS
256 STORED ON DISK IT IS NOT LOST. (IF THE POWER LOSS OCCURS WHILE YOU ARE
257 ENTERING DATA TO THE DISK, THAT DATA MAYBE LOST SINCE THE LAST ENTERED DATA
258 INFORMATION HEADER IS NOT UPDATED UNTIL YOU YOURSELF TERMINATE THE MESSAGE
259 BY TYPING THE CONTROL-C.) THE SYSTEM WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED IN 1975, AND
260 THE PARTICULAR VERSION THAT YOU SEE HERE WAS THE FINAL VERSION MADE WHICH
261 WAS IN 1977 (THERE WERE SOME CUSTOM MODIFICATIONS SINCE THEN, BUT THE
262 BASIC STRUCTURE HAS REMAINED INTACT. BWMS IS ALSO A SPECIAL MODIFICATION
263 OF THAT BASE.) THERE ARE OVER A THOUSAND OF THESE MACHINES IN USE THRU OUT
264 THE WORLD TODAY. WHILE IT IS AN OBSOLETE MACHINE (THAT IS NO MORE DEVELOPMENT
265 IS BEING DONE ON IT 'WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET'.) IT IS STILL BEING MADE
266 AND SOLD TODAY AT THE RATE OF ABOUT 4 OR 5 A MONTH.

268 TO: ALEX   FM: CISTOP MIKEY
269 TNX FOR THE CUDOS ABOUT THE SYSTEM, BWMS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW
270 IT USED TO BE AT A DIFFERENT NUMBER IN WEST LINN UNTIL IT WAS MOVED TO PORTLAND
271 DURING THAT TIME IT HAS BEEN THRU MANY A PHASE, FROM PRIVATE USE CAUSED BY
272 NO ONE KNOWING IT EXISTED, TO THE MESS YOU SEE NOW. IT HAS SEEN ITS SHARE
273 OF 'SOAPS' AND DISCUSSIONS OF JUST ABOUT EVERY SUBJECT UNDER THE SUN. ONE
274 INTERESTING SIDE EFFECT IS THAT SINCE THE DISK MUST BE CHANGED OUT WHEN
275 IT GETS FULL, AN EMPTY DISK WITH NOTHING ON IT REPLACES IT, THIS CAUSES
276 NEW AND DIFFERENT THINGS TO OCCUR ON THE SYSTEM AT A RATHER FAST RATE. 
277 ALTHOUGH IF SOMETHING IS GOING HOT AND HEAVY IT SOMETIMES WILL OVERFLOW
278 ONTO THE NEW DISK. (THE RECORD WAS THE ETHICS DEBATE WHICH WENT TO 4 DISKS
279 THE PREVIOUS WAS THE FANTASY SERIES WHICH WAS 3 DISKS.) EACH DISK CAN HOLD
280 629 LINES OF TEXT. A BLANK LINE OR A DELETED LINE STILL TAKES UP SPACE AND
281 IS COUNTED.

300   In general, crashing a system is interesting and amusing to the 
301 perpetrator and feared by the victim for the same reason:  The
302 information contained therein is valuable and its loss is 
303 damaging.  However, in the case of BWMS, it could be argued that
304 the information contained has a very low value, possibly negative,
305 so crashing this system may actually be a net benefit to the
306 world in general, and Portland in particular.
307 	Thus, the system crashers get their jollies by ALLOWING
308 this system to continue operating, rather than crashing it.
309 ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
310 AN INTERESTING POINT, THAT MAY HAVE MERIT. ALTHOUGH CONSIDERING THAT IT 
311 WAS EXPOUNDED ON BWMS, ONE DOES TEND TO WONDER ........

341   It must be something like a floppy disk, which as we all know, runs in
342 a constant state of "headcrash"!  Ergo, since floppy disks are semiuseful,
343 BWMS must not be totally without value...  Actually, I derive more enjoyment
344 from this system than any other BBS.  There is something quite restrictive
345 about the strictly formatted messages used on the other systems.  Here you
346 can ramble on for 629 lines about anything you like (given a reasonable
347 observance of common decency).

351 not the ultimate in the state of the art, and that it has more that a few
352 limitations.  What he wants to know is what kind of innate I/O does it
353 have.  Being retired, he doesn't want to fritter away his $$$ buying
354 I/O adapters.  Is there any sort of parallel I/O?  How do the game
355 paddles interface with the unit?  Can you use them for binary inputs if
356 games aren't your bag?

360   Yes, the Commodore 64 does have a parrelel port on it, as well
361 as several other niceties such as a built-in RS232 port, etc.
362 Also, it lays out all the (useful) system signals just cryingto be used for
363 the purpose anybody may have in mind.(In other words it is EXTREMELY expan
364 pandable with minimal effort and expense.+

368 PURPOSE AND HOW TO USE IT. ALSO SINCE IT IS A REAL COMMAND IT DOESN'T COME
369 UNDER THE HEADING OF CRASHING AS IT IS NORMALLY APPLIED. HOWEVER, SINCE
370 IT IS ALSO PROTECTED, IT MUST BE CONSIDERED THAT GETTING THRU THE PROTECTION
371 COULD COME UNDER THE HEADING OF SYSTEM CRASHING I SUPPOSE. AN INTERESTING

389 Alan,
390   I would not advise your firriend to get a Vic 64. Its RS232
391 port needs voltage conversions to run (say with the Hayes
392 Smartmodem). Also, It claims that it has 64k. Only 38k is
393 free to the user. Graphics are not dot addressable. I would
394 suggest he geta computer of a higher value than the Vic.
395 The Vic has been the Commodores' biggest failure because they
396 copy the identical circuts exept for a few pins and chips. Nothing
397 more is added. The only good thing about the vic is it has an
398 exellent keyboard. Just a warning.....

474 Tron,
475    I have to disagree with you about the
476 Commodore 64. It is VERY inexpensive considering what
477 it can do. True, not all of the Memory is available IN BASIC,
478 but you can have every byte of the 64k if you're into machine
479 language.  (The basic interpreter just overlays some of the
480 memory. A form of bank switching).
481 The quality of the graphics have a few problems, but these can
482 be programmed around.  Find me another machine for the price
483 that has full sprite capability (8 I believe), has a
484 state of the art "Synthesisor on a chip), YES! it has an 
485 (nearly)full fledged synthesisor in it, PPlus the memory, which will
486 be able to be expanded even further with a card from
487 a third party source soon.  C'mon, admit it.  It's not perfect, but
488 it's very good for the price.  I admit that if enhanced sound
489 and graphics isn't your bag, the the Vic 20 will do exactly as
490 good, but the Commodore 64 is definatly worth the price (and then some)!

506 TRON,
507       THE 64 MAY NOT HAVE CORRECT VOLT LEVELS ON THE RS232 PORT,
508 BUT WHATS THE BIG DEAL, ALL IT TAKES IS 2 CHIPS, AND A FULL WAVE BRIDGE
509 TO TAP OFF THE 64S ALREADY SUPPLIED 9VAC SUPPLY. YOU WOULD BE LOOKING
510 AT ABOUT THREE DOLLARS!

518 mischeivious eye?  She alit in this place in autumn, introducing herself
519 as a 'dillettante' and instigating delightful controversy, not to mention
520 spats of creative narrative by members of BWMS who got into the spirit of
521 making a paradise for themselves...three disks of it, says the 'Cistop'!
522 Will you welcome her again, like true gentlemen?

525 
526    I didn't mean to offend anyone but I think I am holding a
527 grudge on the Vic computers. People go out and buy Vics because
528 they are so cheap. They say they are really good computers but
529 I don't like them at all. But, if some slight chance, the leader
530 of computers (Radio Shack) and the Commodore company teamed up,
531 they could put out one whopper of a computer. I don't think the
532 Vic 64 can compare with any Radio Shack computer (Well, I don't
533 mean the pocket computers) because I have been around Radio
534 Shack since I was in diapers. I guess the Vic has its good
535 advantages. I just don't like the Editor, Speed, Ports and its
536 limitations of not being able to do GOOD graphics. I'm only
537 jealous about one thing on the 64, ITS NICE SOFT-TOUCH KEYBOARD!
538 
539 	              Tron
540 P.S. The Vic also has a good sound system. I heard it make a few
541 noises at a friends house. But still, the Radio Shack Color
542 Computer is better. (Higher graphics and more color for one) plus
543 it has an analog input for audio and other things. But, the Color
544 Computer's keyboard SUCKS!!! If it had the Vics' keyboard, it
545 would be selling like hotcakes.

549    HI CHRIS. OUT HERE MAKING ENEMIES I SEE. I WOULDN'T MAKE ANY
550 JUDGEMENTS ON THE VIC OR THE 64 UNLESS I WAS ABSOLUTELY SURE OF WHAT
551 I WAS TALKING ABOUT. (THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO CONVINCE ME
552 THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS TO GO OUT AND BUY A
553 VIC OR A COMMODORE, USE IT EXTENSIVELY FOR OVER A YEAR OR TWO AND
554 WRITE A FIFTY PAGE OR LARGER REPORT ON IT.)
555 
556    THE ONLY REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE, FROM WHAT I KNOW OF
557 YOU, YOU MAKE HASTY JUDGEMENTS AND TEND TO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS

565      Somebody ought to introduce the cast of characters, so I know to 
566 whom I am speaking (or ATTEMPTING to address); why, some of yon chaps
567 don't even distinguish your pieces with pseudonymity!  Certainly this
568 Dent fellow is off-base--he being so brazenly arrogant to think that he
569 could simply institute a format by commanding it--but really, the date,
570 time and a fanciful label can't help but enchance our communication, eh?
571      I'm impelled to address the recipe-propounder of the last disk:  do
572 you TRULY imagine a home-body, gossipy-type, dill-witted female (the
573 kind who might be charmed by your attempt at attracting them); do you
574 really figure she would also care to have access to a terminal, much less
575 know about this wonderfully obscure place??  I do admit, I was rather 
576 shocked to find Valspeak here; what a sacrilege!  No self-respecting
577 computer nerd would link themselves to this deformed speech--so I thought
578 anyway--for it is despicably common, not to mention popular!
579    Cistop Mike, may I beg your attention?  I would dearly love to see
580 what happened since October of 1982:  how many disks does that consist
581 of, and would it be possible to see them?  I won't have access to this
582 private world for long...Please address me as the Dragon Lady.

588 ***********************************************
589 Tron,
590   It's John.  I'm the unidentified person above.
591   I must disagree with you on your opinions. I have worked VERY extensively
592 with both the TRS-80 (Many models) and the VIC 20.  In my opinion, the Vic
593 is clearly a superior machine. I think the best computer Radio shack puts 
594 out is the PC II, which I own.  The other machines are poorly made (Believe@
595 me, I've been inside enough of them), and perform accordingly. To add insult
596 to injury, Radio Shack vastly overcharges for them. According to a friend
597 of mine, who is a Manager for Radio Shack, They don't sell anything unless
598 they make a 50% profit off of it. That's terrible.  If it sounds like I've
599 got a grudge against Radio Shack, I do. They are low class scum, whos main@
600 way of making money is by overcharging the ignorant. They also purposely 
601 hire unknowledgable peopl to put in their stores. Try talking to ANY of them
602 and get more than a flood of numbers pulled out of a catalog. I called the
603 COMPUTER CENTER once, and they never heard of the 6502 microproccessor. I 
604 wonder if they've heard of the Z-80? I doubt it. And they're the ones that
605 FIX TRS-80s!!!
606    True, the VIC computers ARE aimed at the lower price end, but you make@
607 that sound like a curse! They're the PERFECT things for dedicated-control 
608 systems, or for learning computers on. I bought mine as a base for 
609 modifications. Don't underestimate them because of their low price. What's
610 true in other fields is rapidly becoming true in the computer field:
611   Paying more does not mean you get more.
612   The Vic is not the iideal computer, but neither is ANY computer from RS.@
613 I have used my Vic for (literally) 10 hours a day for over half a year, and
614 other than breakdowns in my modifications, which are no fault of the Vics,
615 I have yet to find a bug, have it breakdown, or anything which I'm co
616 constanntly running into on the RS computers.  If you get the guts to open@
617 yours up, I can guarantee you will find the most unproffesional PC board
618 being sold. I own a small local computer peripheral and software house, and
619 are didly squat compared to RS, but our PC boards are  200% as clean and @
620 proffesional as RS.@
