25   I went to her house last night
26   We sat and talked
27   My thoughts were with you
28   I held her in my arms
29   And wished it were you
30   She asked me to stay
31   I said, "No thanks
32   "Headache you see, I've got to go"
33   Why couldn't it have be you

38     "I believe that MacBeth had free will and just used the prophocy as proof he
39 did not. I think he was guilty of multiple counts of murder 1, and probably a 
40 little genicide on the side. Of course the defense MUST attemte to prove his 
41 client innocent, I am simply saying that it can't be truthfully done.
42   "If one says he had free will, then of course he was guilty, saying he was 
43 tricked into doing it smakes of letting blackmailies who have murdered thier 
44 blackmailer go free. If one says the witches forced his hand, one would be 
45 incorrect because the defense claimed that MacBeth had chosen to have a trial in
46 the first place (not that it was his idea, just that he had chosen it).
47   "I just wanted to remind people of some facts which both the defense and Tanya
48 have not mentioned."

53 sorry above, but your analogy doesn't fit at all. 'blackmailies' who murder
54 blackmailers has about as much in common with the story of Mcbeth as salt
55 has in common with pepper. They are both spices, but that is about it. Your
56 point about free will and 'genicide' just doesn't wash.

78                         Unsaid Words from Yves
79           Becky, I think you should know that it is your intense will to 
80 succeed that has made you one of my finest students. That will is what is
81 driving you, making you push yourself so hard to try to do the best you can.
82 What you must do now is to take your will and place it under control. I have
83 seen you win and I have seen you try your hardest but, you have never been
84 able to do both at the time. Winning requires that you forget about trying to
85 work so hard, you must just do it without the thinking. Let it happen. When
86 you try too hard to succeed, your desire overrides your mastery and you are
87 sure to stumble. If you fall short of the goal, do not stop. Do not stop.
88 All you have to do is realize why it is that you have come short of your goal
89 and reset your goal so that it is not as far from your reach. If you are to
90 continue to be such an valuable student you must not strive for perfection
91 if you still need to learn more of the fundamentals. Perfection will arrive
92 through its lack of attention. Let it happen and it will.
93

95           He may have never said these words to me, but I knew he meant them.
96 "finest" was a bit much, "one of the top five" would be more like it.
97  
98           Thank you, Yves, for the words of critisism and the nods of your
99 head that we knew meant "You can do better than that..." You were more 
100 valuable to me than I knew. At least Tigger listened to you, did he have 
101 a choice?

110 sphere. The rim(s) of the cylinder are EXACTLY even with the surface of the
111 sphere (we are talking geometry here, I know it isn't possible in "reality"
112 ...) The cylinder is 6 meters tall. If we remove the volume of the cylinder
113 from the sphere, what volume remains.

116    "....And Time locked in his tower?"
117 I wrote the last words on Myrddin Emrys. Someone else would get the final credit
118 for it if it was good enough. Oh well, I should be proud if it is saved at all.
119 
120  After I turned it in and went back to my room, it becme appearent that I had a 
121 guest (I noticed this because he was sitting on my only chair).
122  "I came to return this book." he said.
123  "Book, what book?" I asked. He was always doing this sort of thing. "heres that
124 priceless antique I borrowed,oh didn't I tell you, what, you spent $100,000 sea-
125 rching for it, oh sorry, well here it is." Sometimes I could de-claw that over-
126 grown kola bear.
127  "Sometimes I could de-claw you!" I shrieked.
128  "Didn't I tell you?" He asked, smiling sweetly.
129  "No,you didn't," I succeded in controling my temper, "Well, would you like some
130 tea?"
131  "Oh sure, thank you."
132 
133  I flipped through the pages of my new-found book, and found some writing that 
134 hadn't been there before. After several tries, I got him to admit he had written
135 it. After ignoring his adamit refusals, I edited it (after he had left), and
136 printed it.
137 
138  When I got to the Inn, I posted it wherever you post things in Inns, and left 
139 before (I hoped) anyone saw me.

190 The silence that lasted so long was finally to be broken, Gaudy would be the 
191 first to speak.
192      "After you left, where did you go? To the McKane Academy?" she asked in
193 a quiet tone. This seemed to have brought the dark figure out of its sulking.
194      "What? Escape one evil in order to thrust myself into the services of 
195 yet another? Nay, that would have been too simple. Nay. Once free, I had set
196 my mind to alter my life, create for myself a new quest, a new dream, a new
197 vision." The figure said this with the most confidence, his arms swinging as
198 if to tell her to take in all that was around her. But there was nothing to
199 behold, nothing that would indicate that the dream took shape.
200      "Yes, this is really a very intriguing atmosphere. I feel that it must 
201 command quite some respect," said Gaudy with a new voice. She wasn't going to
202 let a chance like this get by.  #Could it be that he has just gone insane?#
203 was one thought that raced through her mind. #If I let him believe that I see
204 what he sees (which is nothing in reality), maybe I can play his bluff.#
205      "Oh, a mere pittance! But from here, I am at the control of a vast number
206 of followers. Such a following that will crush those that do not... It is in
207 my power to...  With these hands I am able..."
208      #Great, I think it could be working. Now if only I could remember what
209 was said about nucleo-repolarizing-psychology. I could bring him back if I
210 can work it out.# Gaudy thought, #He wasn't so bad that he needed removal.#
211      "What then is your vision? Are you set to destroy NET? Have you just 
212 spared me of what you will do to the rest?" she asked trying to remain calm.
213      "How dare you! You? Toy with me? I... I could have you utterly and
214 irrevocably annihilated!" The figure was fuming in a rage of anger.
215      #Mercurial, this one# she thought. "NO, honestly I'm not. You can't 
216 blame me for being curious as to what you have planned. After all, you did
217 bring me here in the first place." Gaudy did have that certain way about
218 her that could even calm the most infuriated L'homme. It seemed to be 
219 working, for the moment at least.

228                                    The "Alternate Reality"
229    The young Master West took his first step forward to ask tha man his question.
230    "Excuse me, sir. Prehaps you could be of some help. I'm looking for someone."
231    Since the man was giving his full attention to the figurine that sat gleaming
232 before him and to the long since emptied vessel of the Inn's fine ale, the boys
233 presence had gone unnoticed until he made his address. Putting down the empty
234 vessel and pushing it away form him he said,
235    "Forgive me, my mind was elsewhere... Was there a question, son?"
236    "Yes there was, sir. I was wondering if you could help me find someone. You
237 see, I am looking for the the one they call the Piper."  At that the man's eyes
238 widend a bit.
239    "Then have a seat and we shall search together, for I am the piper."
240    The boy grabbed the back of the seat near the man and then froze as what had
241 been said began to sink in.
242    "If you...   Then why search?...   "
243    "That is a question you may have to ask of yourself someday. Please! Be
244 seated." After allowing the boy some time to settle into one of the crafted,
245 yet smooth chairs at the table, he continued.  "Now, what is there that I may
246 attempt to answer for you?"
247    Still baffled by his previous statement, he tried to recollect his thoughts.
248    "Truthfully, it is more of a tale than a question, as such. You see, I have 
249 been sent on... an "errand". Yes, that's it. An errand. Well, now that I am on
250 my way, I still do not know what it is that I am supposed to do."
251    "That is odd... Most do not go on an errand and then ask what it is. Am I to
252 understand that you "can not" go back to ask the reason of the errand?" asked
253 the piper.
254    "Yes, precisely! It's all a little embarassing to at the moment, though,"
255 said the boy. With this, he then related to the piper how he had been sent on
256 his journey- up to the moment he walked into the door of the Inn.
257    "And since it said that 'I need but ask...' I decided I would. And that is
258 why I ask you for your help on this matter."
259    "Ah! Then we are to share in the learning of a lesson! How odd that we would
260 need to learn the same lesson at different times in our lives."
261    The young Master West was now really feeling baffled.

285 a lot of SCA literature lately?)  Actually, I am here on a lowly mission to

287 take a peek at the cork boards of my Favourite Inne.  And boy, did I pick a

294 horrid state of suspense and dismay awaiting my turn at the wheel? Does she
295 sit in some lone and quiet place pondering her next entry of love or laughter?
296 I'm but a poor soul at best in giving the needed influx of honey and toast to
297 those who have tasted so little of lifes sweet breathes but still do give of
298 their spontenaity and talent so that pawns such as I can endeavor to rise above

313   He fell much further that he should.  This had to be a very large room.  He 
314 hit on his hands, hard even in this low gravity, and rolled to his feet.
315   He could here the muffled breathing from more than one person.  He had been
316 expected.
317   His ears strained against the tiny sounds, tring to make sence of them, then
318 he felt more than heard the unsound of the noise dampers, high out of hearing
319 range.
320   He felt movement to the right and with a feirce move attacked into the dark-
321 ness.  A brief tangle of arms and legs, then he searched the body.  No weapons.
322   They were not blind, the one on the floor was wearing night gear, the others
323 would be too.  He ran along the wall, his hand lightly touching the passing 
324 surface.  A door.  He stopped.
325   It would be locked, or they would have stopped him before now.
326   In a flash of thought his hand flew out in the darkness to the light control.
327 Soft light flowed into the room, and with it three screams filled the air.
328 The smile broadened.  Light amplifiers.
329   Ten feet away was the nearest, tearing at his helment like a wildman.  A few
330 more moments and the blindness would be irreversible.  He grabbed the rithing
331 form and forced a hand onto the gray square next to the wall.  The door slid
332 open.
333   He closed the door to muffle the screams.
334   The corridor was clear.  He headed toward the upper levels.

360 the hand-signs sent to him by Tina on the side lines. Things were almost 
361 under control. Shortly afterwards, someone noticed what was going on and let
362 a few others in on the deal. Gary Mitchell, a long term competitor against
363 the peanut butter industry- for God only knows why- had decided to watch
364 what was taking place from the onset. Tina had recognized him when first she
365 saw him, but wasn't sure where he fit into the scene. Tina signalled Jack to
366 come over to the railing for a quick chat.
367    "What is it, Tina? You look concerned. Is there anything wrong?"
368    "I'm not sure. Maybe I'm just a little paranoid but I think we're being
369 watched."
370    "Of course we're being watched," said Jack. "We're in the Market, everyone
371 is being watched in here."
372    "No, not that. I mean us, I think WE are being watched," said Tina as she
373 looked around into the crowd.
374    "That's easy then, we'll just atke our time. We have all day to spend the
375 323 grand on all the Jif stock we can get our hands on," replied Jack smoothly.
376    "It may not be as easy as that," said Tina nervously.
377    "What can go wrong now? (famous last words.)  It's simple- We buy the Jif
378 stock and the price goes up a little. Marci and Tony give the 'other guys' some
379 of the good ol'  'Jimmy Carter' for good measure. Then when that hits the news
380 their price drops, Jif goes through the roof and the business is saved. Right?"
381    "Don't you get it? It all sounds too easy now. Where could I have gone 
382 wrong?" muttered Tina.
383    "Hey, don't do that to yourself. You've got a great head on your shoulders,
384 the plan was great, it'll work. Trust me."
385    "I still think we're being watched," said Tina.
386 Yes, they were being watched. As Jack went about making the Jif purchases,
387 Mitchell passed the word to others to liquidate their holdings in Jif. This
388 caused mixed reactions. The indicator showed Jif to be standing firm during
389 medium trade, then it showed Jif to lose a fraction of a point after heavy 
390 trade. Mitchell then went to his corner in the Pit, got a cup of water from
391 the water dispenser, and began to feel really good for having slipped the 
392 peanut butter business a curve ball. Jack and Tina had another quick chat.
393    "You see? I told you it was too easy. Now what?" asked Tina.
394    "No problem. The Jif price has fallen, right? Now we can get more stock
395 for the money, right? I'll just buy in slightly larger bundles, that's all.
396 It'll work itself out, you'll see," answered Jack.
397    "You think of everything, Don't you?" said Tina, now more reasssured.

439   The Lady always got so upity when the Former took them, that he had just decided not to tell her about taking this one.
440   It isn't like he wasn't going to return it, or even as if she didn't know who hd taken it. He did leave a note where it used
441 to rest, and the note did have a name on it, it even explained why he had taken it.
442 
443   The Lady had said to him that he could borrow the book in question, some five months ago. In trying to get the Lady to go in
444 the Inn, he had said something like "Well, I'll borrow it when you go to the Inn."
445 
446   Althought the conversation drooped a bit after that, the promise was made on both sides. Later, when the Former found that
447 the Lady had made ann appearence, he realized he had to remain true to his word. And he took it, and it was the Lady's fault
448 that she wasn't there to acknowledge that he had taken it on time.

491     "A remarkable tendency, one that always plagued Napoleon."  Said the Pastor
492 to the little girl, looking oh so vulnerable with torn shirt and hem.
493     "All well and good, but you are totally forgetting the plight of this young
494 girl.  Look at her, do you think she wants to hear about Napoleon?"  Said the
495 Armorer to the Pastor, trying to speak with a tone of infinate patience.  And
496 failing quite miserably of course.
497 
498     "And you should talk, at least I was trying to calm down the girl!""  Said
499 the Pastor in rebuff.
500     "You were not, you were trying to sound wizened, to impress her is what I
501 think you were doing."  Said the Armorer, becoming quite involved with this
502 little arguement.  One of many recently.  They always seemed to be fighting
503 these days.
504 
505     "Neither of you are helping me, who of all these people is the Former?"
506 Said the little girl to the immature two people in front of her.
507     "Please forgive us,"  Said the Pastor, with eyes sinking deeply, and brow
508 lowering also.  They felt stupid, and the Armorer continued to finish the
509 apology that the saddening Pastor had started.
510     "We do start to argue for the slightest things, we can never seem to agree
511 on anything else anyway.  Sorry about that, it wont happen again."  Said the
512 Armorer, enforcing his statement with a threatening look at the Pastor.
513 
514     "Neither of you are helping me, who of all these people is the Former?"
515 Said the girl, cheeks afluster with building frustration and anger at these
516 dottering men.  Perhaps yelling at them, thought the girl, might get her a
517 straight answer as to who the `Former' is.
518 
519     With this, the men simply turned a heavy head towards a teddy bear, sitting
520 animatedly on top of a table explaining something in great detail to a very
521 skeptical onlooker.  Could this be the Former?
522 
523     The little girl walked over to the Former.  Almost because she was afraid
524 to take her eyes off of him, she bumped into an empty chair.  The rather loud
525 commotion that resulted from the chair tipping over attracted attention from
526 even the darkest lit corners of this `Inn'.  Even more fraught with this latest
527 humiliation, she swatted the chair aside and stepped up to the Former.  Quite
528 silenced with wonder the Former was sitting there with mouth agape. She looked
529 at him and then an the front doors with a look that dripped ice.
530 
531     The Former jumped off the table, and staired eye to eye with the little
532 girl, and after a tense moment of mutual wonder, the Former moved to the door.
533 Seemingly quite under the wrath of a very mad girl.  A very mad girl, in the
534 rags of a peasant.
535     The scene slowly returned to normal after the commotion was over, and soon
536 conversations started to pop up again all over the commons.  Most carried the
537 subject of how violent life really was.

542 "I'm so confused."  
543 L'homme - 'long time to answer the puzzle'?  I answered it 300 lines after
544 your friend 'mini-quiz-mistress' (harumph!) put it on here, which happened
545 to be the next time I logged on after seeing it.  Considering how hard it is
546 to get on here these days, it would have been difficult to respond sooner.
547 _Leonard_ - I'm a bit unsure in my visualization of your cylindar/sphere.
548 If I interpret it correctly, the cylinder can be long & thin, or short & fat, 
549 or in-between.  Or it may be irrelevant to the problem... It's been 16 years
550 since I took geometry; I'm a bit rusty.   Hmmm...

553 To ALL: There seems to be quite a bit of ruckus (could I define the ruckus?)
554 lately about the people baring their true faces. Some people seem to wonder what
555 pursuaded others to take on the persona of their oposite sex. If you all will
556 recall the Dustin Hoffman comedy "Tootie,"
557 we see an illustration of this. Not only does he don women's makeup and
558 clothing for the purpose of employment, he also consideres  it (whether
559 he admits it or not) a great acting challenge. If I could be so bold to say
560 that The Inn is the personal computer world's closest offering of a real-life^
561 social situation, then we can all consider ourselves as actors, with Backwater
562 being our stage. It is up to us to create our characters"makeup", and
563 "costumes". But the best part is: there is no Director telling us how to act.
564 Just our own feelings, and, oftentimes, whims. Cistop Mikey created the stage,
565 and we are the players.
566     Just a little thought to keep in mind.
567     Godspeed and good fortune in your endeavors!

572 Leonard: I, having had some Geometry just a short while ago, am also having
573 a difficult time envisualizing this sphere/cylinder.  The height of the 
574 cylinder may or may not have any relation to its diameter, which of course is
575 not stated- therefore there is three conclusions that can be drawn:
576 1.  You forgot to include something.
577 2.  I'm getting very rusty in my Geometry, and there is a solution.
578 3.  There isn't a solution at all.  Or rather, there is an infinite number of
579 solutions.
580 A cylinder, 6 meters in length (height), perfectly resting inside a sphere?
581 Is there more to the description than that?

585 A dark lady walks into the Inn, seats herself far from the jabbering crowds
586 A look of hesitation crosses her face; can she really join into these
587 conversations that have taken shape over so long a time?  She wraps 
588 herself deeper into her cloak, but in doing so a glint can be seen from
589 her forehead.  She wants to join in, but she doesn't understand.  She
590 will eat with them, drink with them, but cannot understand their
591 conversation.  Perhaps she will speak, but when she does, what will they
592 think?
593                            ( )

595 Sometimes a joker is not the jester but rather the fool. How so does one 
596 conclude to which he has become? Of course it is his audience. Be they frivial
597 and jovial then be he the jester but if their mood turns to snicker then 
598 per chance doth the fjester become the fool. So it is with life, as it is 
599 sometimes hard to determine whether there is laughter or is the sound really
600 that of jeers and half hid goofaws of pity and embarrassment.
