 39      The chamber was silent, save for   the humming of the great machine that
 40 took up most of the western wall.  Huge cabinest lined the base of the machine,
 41 shuddering with concealed power.  A dim red light on an ivory console glimmered
 42 every so often, like a sickly heartbeat, though none were present to count its
 43 feeble pulse.
 44      Across from the bank of machinery, carved into the rough, cavernous stone
 45 of the eastern wall, a hollow tube of   glass pulsated  in tune with the light,
 46 throbbing with what might have been caalled anticipation, were the descriptioon
 47 applied to something that could be considered alive.  Yet, anticipation it 
 48 resembled, glimmering with a vigor of power that the ancient cavern had not 
 49 borne silent witness to in whaat had seemed like millenia uncounted.
 50      Within the confines of the glass   tube, a thin green mist seeped from a
 51 silver cannister, ntil, eventually, it filled the whole of the tube.  In a 
 52 matter of moments, in convulsed spasmically, shaping itself into a form most
 53 familiar to these echoing halls.
 54      Michael stepped out of the chamber, brushing away ambient sparks of 
 55 energy from his softly glowing aura of  royal blue.  "Pathetic," he whispered,
 56 in his metal voice.  "One would think   that the Masters would provide me with
 57 a more satisfactory method of dimension shifting."  Frowning with distaste over
 58 the fluffy bits of raw energy lining his cloak of red, he removed the garment
 59 and flapped it a few times, sending the particles flying into the air, where, 
 60 free from the bonds that held them, they departed from the visible reality.
 61      Sighing, Michael limped over to    the gigantic machine, mindful of the 
 62 wounds he had recieved from the paradox on Pyrrix A'aaal.  At least here, 
 63 while he was outside the relative time  frame, they would nnot worsen, and tyhe
 64 paradox would remain in a state of self-proportion until his return.
 65      His thin fingers jabbed absently   at a rounded pattern of squares within
 66 circles, until each of the four shapes  hidden in the overall pattern were 
 67 glowing with tthe same aura as his own.  The machine's droning increased, as 
 68 small bits of raw data began fluttering across a miniature screen embedded in a
 69 thick, blocky monitor of black.
 70      Michael eyed the read-outs with    interest.  "Ambient energy fluxes 
 71 centralizing around Stone Triangle." he read, repeating the words aloud.  
 72 "Centralization of fluxes indicates up  to %90 probability of Stone Triangle as
 73 source for up to %99.9990108 of energy  creating paradox.  Focal pont of main
 74 thrust of paradox remains Quantier."
 75      Engrossed as he was in his thoughts, Michael failed to notice the presence
 76 creeping up on him from a corner of the cavern.  *Difficulties, Michael?* it 
 77 whispered, in a voice of satin.
 78      Michael started, drawing around,   his hand reaching for the thin line in
 79 the holster of his belt.  His muscles,  tensed in anticipation of battle, 
 80 relaxed suddenly when his eyes made contact with the large dog that stared up 
 81 at him with deep brown eyes.  Michael   tousled the thick white fur on its 
 82 head, noting, as always, the slight tingle of electricity thatprickled through
 83 him.  "Oh," he sighed.  "Mukluk, I just wasn't expecting you to be here."
 84      *People seldom do.* came the nebulous response.  *Have you settled the 
 85 location of the paradox?*
 86      "Well," Michael began, seating himself in a rotating chair.  "I've 
 87 centralized it as unique to Pyrrix A'aal, and to the Quantier, naturally.  But
 88 as for the actual site of the temporal  fluctuation, the computer has only 
 89 given me percentages and probabilities, though those lend strongly to the idea
 90 that the solution is intrinsic to the   Stone Triangle."
 91      *Could it be related to the destruction of Innisfall?*
 92      "The thought's crossed my mind more than once, but I don't think so.  I
 93 did, however, detect some familiar presence while I was there, but I lost it 
 94 before I could make any sort of meaningful contact.  I think that it might have
 95 been little more than a stranger passing over familiar ground.  I was planning 
 96 on having PRISM run some diagnostics on the temporal patterns,, though, just to
 97 make sure I'm not missing anything in my concentration on the Friar."
 98      Mukluk winced.  *Things didn't go  well.  I can feel it in your thoughts.*
 99      "That, my friend, is the understatement of the century.  Apparently, he 
100 has the Quantier."
101      Another wince.  *Preserve us.  I'd have thought you would take it fm him
102 straight out.*  The brown eyes glanced  upwards critically.
103      "Believe me, I've tried.  It seems that the damnable thing has bonded 
104 itself to Friar, possibly even to the   whole of Pyrrix A'aaal.  My presence as
105 a foreign entity to the temporal stream triggered some violent reactions along 
106 the fourth Element that I'd rather not  go into atpresent."  AA weary fist 
107 pounded against the stone table.  "I've failed, at least for now."
108      Mukluk suddenly brightened a bit.  *The Fourth Element?  Could The Pool be
109 somehow involved in this?*  Long dead   memories of a forgotten dsert realm
110 flooded the husky's mind.
111      "I know what you're thinking, and  I'm having PRISM look into it.  The 
112 ties are strong, but I can't be certain that this dimension's Pool is the same
113 as the one we're looking for.  I do know, however, that Friar expressed an
114 interest in it, and, as such, it must have at least a minor connection to the 
115 paradox.  Something else, though."
116      *What?* the husky queried.
117      "I'm not sure," came the reply.    "I just can't shake the feeling that
118 there's something here, simmering just  beneath the surface....  something 
119 so familiar to me that I'm missing, that could be all encompassing to much of
120 the puzzle."

127         Surveillance detection had always seemed simple enough in theory.
128 Bt Simon Albright was finding it exceedingly difficult to monitor his
129 surroundings from behind an upturned overcoat collar.  He was surprised
130 to discover how highly a dry neck rated on his priority list.
131         Head down against the driving rain, he made his way steadily to-
132 ward the designated point of rendezvous, where agent Scarlet would become
133 his first post-recruitment contact.  As McQueen had explained to him,
134 security dictated minimal knowledge of George's internal organization.
135 For some time Albright would be allowed contact with only a few agents.
136 Eventually he might be able to recruit new members.  Only after years of
137 service under observation could he hope to gain admittance to the upper
138 levels of George administration and policy.
139         Albright arrived at the bus stop where the meeting was supposed to
140 take place, located the telephone booth, and leaned against it as per the
141 plan.  In the event of a problem, Scarlet could reach him by phone, though
142 this was unlikely.
143         The 2 pm meeting time came and went.  At ten past two a bus
144 arrived, which left Albright standing conspicuously alone at the corner.
145 At eleven past two the phone rang.
146         The voice on the other end said exactly what Albright expected it
147 to, but not in the way he expected.  The conversation was a standard code
148 any outsider would have interpreted as a wrong number.
149         Hello, may I speak with Mr. Marco please?  I'm sorry, you must
150 have the wrong number.  Are you quite certain?  Yes, sir.  This is a bus
151 stop.  Could you make certain?  There's no one here, sir.  This is a...
152         And so on.  But the voice Albright heard was not cold and low or
153 gavelly or disguised or nervous or uncertain or any of those things he
154 imagined his own to be.  It was a voice that belonged to an old man --
155 or, better yet, to an absent-minded scholar.  Ruse?  or was his contact
156 actually (as Albright had sketched him) a bookish man with one hemisphere
157 stranded in academia?
158         The crux of the message was that Scarlet had been delayed, but
159 that the meeting would take place in fifteen minutes.  Same location.
160 Normally such occurrences would altogether void a scheduled rendezvous,
161 but Albright had been warned that standard frames of reference were of
162 little value where Scarlet was concerned.
163         Leaning near the phone again, Albright realized what had been
164 bothering him.  Along with the background traffic noise, the stranger's
165 voice had been accompanied by a quiet, constant clicking -- like fingers
166 tapping a keyboard.  Albright decided to keep his eyes open for a man with
167 a portable computer.

179 	It was 4am, and I was halfway through my history term paper.  It
180 was due at 8am sharp, I was in trouble.  (Note to the reader, this is all 
181 PURE fiction. The Editor.)  This being my last year I'd had to take
182 Histriography.  Its sort of the class where you prover yourself before they
183 give you you're degree.  If you're a history major that is.  And here I was
184 staring bleary eyed at my computers CRT wondering what to write next.
185  
186 	The subject had seemed like an easy one.  I'd been able to pick it out
187 myself, and since one of my favorite eras has always been the sixtees, I 
188 decided to find a subject that fit somewhere in there.  Since I also had
189 a great love for music it seemed like a natural to combine the two.  I'd
190 read a good deal about the two over the last several years, so I figured the
191 paper would be a breeze.  Wrongo.  First, most of what I had read had been
192 in music periodicals that had since made the long pilgrimage to the dump.  And
193 it's not like you're average library keeps the last 15 years of Rolling stone
194 on hand either.  And finding reference books hadn't been much easier.  I'd
195 managed to chase down a couple, but they just weren't enough to base
196 a 35 page paper on.  Not if I wanted to do anything other the parrot what
197 the authors said.
198  
199 	So here I was, 15 pages in and out of wind.  'Time to turn on the
200 B*llsh*t gland.' I thought to myself.  It was about then that I heard the 
201 music.  It wasn't very loud, and since I was up already it didn't really 
202 bother me either.  I sat staring at the screen for another fifteen minutes
203 or so.  Searching for inspiration.  All that time the music had been droning
204 on in the background.  It sounded somewhat like the Psychedelic stuff that
205 a lot of the San Francisco Bands had been playing around '66 and '67.  Sort
206 of different though, kind'of like Jefferson Airplane meets REM.  I began to
207 wonder where it was coming from.  It sounded like it was coming from behind
208 me.  I figured maybe I'd left my clock radio on or somthing.  Wondering what
209 station it was I wandered back to see.  It only took me a moment to figure
210 out that the radio was not on.  So the mystery had deepened.  The sound seemded
211 to be coming from under my bed.  Very strange indeed.  Now that I looked, 
212 I noticed a rather peculiar thing.  There was a blue light eminating from 
213 under my bed.  Carefully I pulled it aside to see what was going on.
214  
215 	My room had sprouted a hole about 3 feet in diameter.  I looked over the 
216 edge, but could see nothing at first but a misty haze permeated with the soft 
217 blue light.  suddenly somthing seemed to grab me and pull me in.  I flailed
218 out trying to find somthing to hold onto.  My hand came to rest on the handle
219 to my guitar case.  Instinctivly I grabed ahold.

261 	I fell for what seemed like an eternity.  The dull blue light all around
262 me, and that strange music always somewhere in the distance.  I grabbed ahold 
263 of my guitar case.  It was  a bit of reality in the pale sea on unreality
264 that surrounded me.
265  
266 	And then there were voices, I could here them indistinctly at first, and
267 then with greater clarity.  They spoke in some strange language that I had 
268 never heard before.  I realized that the voices were droning over the music,
269 in some strange sort of vocal accompanament.  I had no sense of the speed at 
270 which I was falling,  but it didn't take a genius to figure that I'd be making
271 a big red splatter wherever I happened to land.  
272  
273 was no evidence to indicate that I was falling at all.  Then there was a sudden

280      *Consider your move carefully, my  friend.*
281      Michael grimaced, his eyes making  contact for a moment with those of the
282 great beast that sat before the opposite end of the marble chess table.  His
283 thin fingers rested lightly on a carved tower of ivory, his Rook.  "Don't I   
284 always?"
285      *You certainly didn't on Pyrrix A'aaal.*  A wave of empathetic 
286 chastisement sent a shiver up Michael's spine.
287      "Point taken."  He eyed the pieces on the board once more.  The game had
288 barely begun, and already Mukluk had managed to drive him into a dead lock, or 
289 so the situation appeared.  "Any suggestions?"
290      *Michael, the game is yours.*
291      "No, I'm referring to the paradox."
292      *Then my advice is the same.*
293      Michael rolled his eyes.  "Ever the cryptic mentor?" he smiled.
294      *It's my job.*
295      Michael sighed, his other hand tapping against the stone table.  "It's 
296 just so frustrating," he began, after a long pause.  "To come so close to one's
297 goals, only to have them snatched away."  He stared out the giant picture 
298 window bhind his companion, at the swirling mists of the time stream.  "And 
299 all because I was unprepared."
300      *Happens to the best of us.  But I see no point in moping.  What are your
301 plans?*
302      Michael thought for a moment.  "The paradox is, as I said, in a point of
303 stasis at present, self-perpetuating.   My degeneration has halted, and I 
304 COULD forseeably contact the Masters for a new assignment."
305      Mukluk scowled mentally.  A black  tide of emotions tingled through 
306 Michael's being.  *But you won't.*  It  was not a suggestion.
307      "No."  Again, he paused.  "But I   certainly can't go running willy nilly
308 through a closed dimension that has just gone through an energy shift of major
309 proportions.  The timeline is much too  unstable.  I'm having an unfavorable 
310 relationship with their Primary Source  already."
311      *The Stone Triangle, you mean?  I  can identify.*  Thoughts of the Tower
312 ran through Mukluk's mind, and the half hearted sigh of images trailed through
313 his empathetic link with Michael.
314      "Contemplating Tanis again?"
315      *It's nothing, really.*
316      "I wouldn't abandon all hope.  It  is not an impossibility.  Were we to
317 locate the proper Pool, we could-"
318      *It's Nothing, Really.*  Mukluk repeated.
319      Michael felt a surge of heat well  in the bottom of his soul.  Fighting
320 off the contact, he continued.  "You    simply can't go on trying to forget."
321      *You think I have?"*  A seething wall of anger began to cloud the link.
322 *My life is linked to Tanis.*  The small green stone at the base of Mukluk's
323 collar began to glow softly. *I carry  a legacy of my contact with that 
324 realm.  It is as much a part of me as   my spirit.*
325      "Then why the avoidance?"
326      *You have more important things to think about..*  Mukluk hesitated for a 
327 moment, pensive.  *I'm going with you   next time.*
328      Michael frowned.  "I was thinking  more along the lines of bringing along
329 Standor."
330      *Any particular reasoning behind your objection?*
331      "I'm certainly bringing Standor.   I'm dealing with a dimension that has a
332 combination of Magiks and Science.  It  isn't something I'm ready to deal with
333 at this stage.  A Magik Paradox is one  thing, a Technical Paradox another,  
334 but the causes of a paradox on a world  such as this could be so varied as to
335 threaten more than just one single factor of Reality Prime.  Standor's 
336 experience on the SINAT Station as well as his familiarity with Magikal realms
337 will be vital.  And I can't jeopardize  both of you.  We're shorthanded as it 
338 is.  I need your advice, but you'll be  better equipped to give it researching 
339 back here.  Someone needs to guard PRISM while I'm away."
340      #I'm more than capable of handling any situations that arisse during your
341 absence.# The soft, soothing voice echoed through the cavern.
342      Michael looked up, instinctively.   "Forgive me, PRISM."  he addressed the
343 computer, whose network of sensors ran  throughout the entire compound.  "Have
344 you uncovered athing new?"
345      #Nothing yet.  I've been trying.   It's not easy to pierce the veil.#
346      "Well, continue."
347      #I hear and comply.#
348      Michael returned his attention to  Mukluk.  Sighing, he moved his piece
349 across the board.
350      *Check.*  Mukluk stated.
351      Michael cursed, realizingthat he  had lifted his hand from the Rook.
352 "I'm beaten, I'm afraid."
353      *So I SHALL accompany you to the   surface.*
354      "This is Pyrrix A'aaal!  Remember, a good portion of Innisfall's
355 population arrived en masse during the  catastrophe.  And, as I recall from 
356 some of your stories, you'd established quite the reputation there."
357      *Be that as it may, I insist.*
358      "Very well." Michael gave in.  His heart really wasn't in the argument.
359 "We shall depart as soon as I have recovered my strength and stocked enough 
360 provisions to protect us from the effects of the Stoneriangle... and the 
361 Quantier."
362      *Aren't you forgetting the Friar?*
363      "Oh no," Michael replied.  "I'm most certainly nt forgetting Friar.  In
364 fact, I've been considering a plan to deal with him once and for all."

387 What's the use of incantations
388 Needing stange gesticulations,
389 Eyeballs of obscure crustacas,
390 Toenails of a toad?
391  
392 What's the use of years of training,
393 Spells that don't work when it's raining
394 Or because the moon is waning?
395 Better far is Code!
396  
397 Code's the stuff we write now.
398 Code that's clean and tight now.
399 Run it through your Apple II
400 (Try not to stay up fixing it all night, now.)
401  
402 Ancient mages, through the ages
403 Frequently were prone to violent rages
404 Due to poring over pages
405 Filled with ink that glowed.
406  
407 Oftentimes a poor old biddy
408 Found on her familiar kitty
409 Ticks and fleas, which (more's the pity)
410 Moved into her rugs.

412 Shamans using dung from cattle
413 With small insects must do battle.

449 Fiction alert.
450 	The mist cleared slowly from my eyes.  The view that greeted me was not
451 an altogether pleasent one.  Standing around me where three of the toughest 
452 looking men I had ever seen.  Being a bit on the scrawny side myself I didn't
453 really like my chances if it came to a fight.
454  
455  
456 	One of them grunted.  The one with the large ear ring piercing his left
457 lobe nodded and motioned for me to stand.  I got to my feet and took the time 
458 to check out the rest of my surroundings.  It appeared that I was in some sort
459 of club, with a fair sized stage and several tables.  The place was empty and 
460 dark, and there was a strange aroma wafting about.  Earing grabed me by my 
461 coller and started to drag me towards the stage.  I barely managed to grab my 
462 guitar.  His two companions followed.  Strewn about the stage where the sort
463 of instruments you'de expect to see in you're typical Rock oriented band.  
464 Electric Guitars, Drums, keyboards , amps and mics.  As I passed the keyboards
465 I noticed a woman sitting listlisly at the boards.  My 'guide' led me up to
466 one of the amps, beside which sat an electric guitar.  He let go of me for a 
467 moment, but one of his companions took his place nearly immediatly.  soon my 
468 right leg was chained to the floor.  
469  
470 	Earing picked up the Electric Guitar and handed it to me.  I carefully
471 put down my case.  I'd never played an electric.  Earing and his buddies 
472 wandered off to other parts of the stage.  It didn't suprise me a bit when
473 Earing stepped up to the front center of the stage.

481  
482    Thought for the day;
483  
484    Are you truely free?  Do you have true freedom and the ability to
485 move about and do as you please?  Can you go anywhere on the
486 face of the Earth without being accosted?  Can you walk into your
487 local Armed Forces Base - remember, they are protecting you
488 freedom - and go where you please?
489  
490    Can you ever have freedom in a society?  Can there ever be
491 a society without police?  Do the police protect your freedom or
492 do they take it away?  Does the legislature create your freedom in
493 Written Law, or do they remove your freedom with the Written Law?
494  
495    What about junkies?  Overnight, by Act of Congress, millions
496 of junkies became criminals.  Which do they need - to regain their
497 freedom through rehabilitation, or to loose it through
498 Law Enforcement?
499  
500    Who pays for your freedom?  You do.  How do you pay for it?
501 Through taxes.  How are the taxes used to accomplish this?
502 They fund the Law Enforcement groups and your local legislature.
503 What happens if you refuse to pay taxes?  You loose your freedom.
504 How does that happen?  Law Enforcement interprets written Laws
505 made by the legislature and takes your freedom from you.
506  
507    BUT...
508  
509    Can you enjoy your freedom without need of Law Enforcement?
510 Can you walk down Union Avenue at midnight without being molested,
511 mugged, drugged, or generally abused by other people?  Does Law
512 Enforcement allow you to maintain your freedom?  Does it protect
513 you from horrible things done by horrible people?  Does it protect
514 you from otherwise deadly situations?
515  
516    Which is more important - your freedom or your personal
517 rights?  Can you have both?  Can you have both in society?
518 Can you have both without society?
519  
520    Freedom is a word that has been misused and overrated.  Freedom
521 simply means that you can select from several different actions the
522 one best suited for your needs.  This does not always include ethical,
523 moral, or religous implications.  To say that I am free is to
524 say that I may do as I please, reguardless.  Yet if I am to have
525 the mutual respect and understanding of my rights and the rights
526 of others, must I sacrifice freedom?
527  
528    Next election, think about what freedom means to you.  Think
529 about how every candidate and every Senator and every Legislator
530 will view your freedom.  Are the two images of your freedom, and
531 their interpretation of your freedom the same?
532  
533    Think about how advertisements show politicians "protecting
534 your freedom" and how they are "patriotic to their country".
535 Then think about the (roughly) $80,000 to $1,000 they will
536 make a year, not including fundraisers, keynote speaker appear-
537 ences, books, contract deals, and the occational under-the-
538 table kickback from companies (not everyone is corrupt,
539 but to say that none are is a misnomer) that they will POCKET.
540  
541    Now do you understand why Mickey Mouse stood a good chance of
542 becoming our president several years ago?
543  
544    Next election, I ...might...  ...maybe...  ...could...
545 participate.  (there, I said it.)
546  
547    I think I'll elect Dr. Fu Manchu for mayor of Portland.

611         At 2:49 pm a nearly empty bus pulled up to the curb where Albright
612 was waiting.  Moments later it pulled away, two individuals nearer to
613 emptiness.
614         The odd tandem peering from their curbside vantage was far too
615 conspicuous to include the veteran spy he was waiting for.  But, on the
616 other hand, they were so unlikely, it was unthinkable that one of them was
617 NOT the spy he was waiting for.  But then, knowing that they would be seen
618 as unlikely spies, and knowing that others would know that they knew them-
619 selves to be unlikely, they certainly could not be spies, owing to their
620 knowing that others would know them to be relying on the unlikeliness of
621 their owning the identity that they so obviously concealed by way of
622 obviously possessing.
623         One man was tall and thin and was hunched over a small hand-held
624 device that he tapped nimbly with the bony fingers of his right hand.
625 A small coiled cable ran from the machine to his belt.  The gray suit he
626 wore was rumpled and included a black tie that was loosened and tattered.
627 He squinted savagely when he looked up, but appeared to be carrying no
628 glasses to afford him a view of such objects whose greater-than-arm's
629 distance rendered them uninteresting.  Mostly he was absorbed by the
630 little device in his hand.
631         The other man was shorter and a little bit dumpy.  His position
632 just behind and to the right of his companion, plus an intangible air of
633 ready attentiveness, bespoke a subservient nature.  Albright could easily
634 picture the man scribbling in a notebook, dutifully recording every word
635 his master uttered.  He wore a brown suit with a vest whose buttons
636 strained under the tension of an overly-liberal belly.
637                         
638         The two made their way toward Albright.  They stopped a few feet
639 away, where the thin man squinted at Albright, then looked down at his
640 device, and back and forth again.  Satisfied at last, he hit a few keys,
641 and spoke.
642         "One wonders," he said, "if one would be favorably disposed
643 towards lending one a cigarette."
644         This was the proper greeting, but Albright was surprised at the
645 third-person format.  "I've got two left."  He responded, offering him the
646 expected brand.
647         The thin man took a cigarette and tore off the filter.  Albright
648 lit up his last, waiting for his contact to complete the greeting.  But
649 the man had returned to his device and seemed all at once oblivious to
650 Albright's existence.  The pause was just reaching the discomfort thresh-
651 hold when the plump man leaned to his master and whispered something.
652         "What?  Don't be ridiculous!"  The odd man responded too loudly.
653 "You know I don't smoke!"
654         At which the assistant grimaced, checked quickly over his shoulder,
655 and whispered again.
656         "Huh? Oh!"  The thin man proclaimed.  Then he checked his hand and
657 seemed genuinely surprised to find a cigarette residing there.  "One
658 wonders if one would be favorably disposed towards offering one a light."
659         "Of course."  Albright answered, handing the man a lighter.
660         The thin man lit it a couple times, apparently intrigued by the
661 functioning of the thing.  Then he typed something on his keyboard and
662 tried to light the cigarette.
663         But Albright realized that, until that moment, the physical act of
664 smoking had never once presented itself as an option to the man.  He held
665 his mouth about an inch from one end of the cigarette, and the flame about
666 an inch from the other end.  And as he slowly moved his mouth toward the
667 cigarette, his hands involuntarily moved ahead of him, maintaining all the
668 same distances and preventing any of the necessary contacts.
669         Just about the time when Albright expected the craning-necked,
670 bulging-eyed man to fall over, the latter managed, with a valiant
671 "oo-like" lip contortion, to make lip/cigarette contact.  And then, slowly
672 bringing the flame back, the circuit was closed!  With a deep, wide-eyed
673 sucking, the man breathed in his first and undoubtedly his last lungful of
674 tobacco smoke.
675         Albright had to draw puprosefully on his own cigarette to keep
676 himself from laughing.  Within moments the thin man was gasping and
677 wheezing.  For the first time, Albright sensed that the man was conscious
678 of the world beyond the little device now clipped to his belt.
679                         
680         And so it was that contact was made, albeit somewhat ungracefully.
681 And on that day, anyone passing by a certain corner in a certain city
682 would have witnessed a rather unusual trio:  one sniggering behind a
683 cigarette, one frantically checking over his shoulders, and one stabbing
684 zealously with his foot at a small, mangled object on the pavement,
685 driving it quite mercilessly into the most profound state of oblivion.

689 A note - a common misconception is that the entry above represents a resurgence
690 of the NET.  This is not true.  Once the necessary groundwork has been laid,
691 the story will be thrown open for others to participate in.  If someone wants 
692 to resurrect the NET, that is fine - the story will need an antagonist (George,
693 by default, being the protagonist).  On the other hand, unless someone else
694 brings up NET, L'homme sans Parity, Joshua, Ian MacHinery et al., they will NOT
695 be appearing.  Thank you.

713 I've decided to start doing these story entrys at home, and then upload 
714 them.  This gives me a chance to (Hopefully) do a better job.  
715  
716 ***********************************************************************
717  
718 	A Primordial scream errupted from Earing, and his two partners
719 began to lay down a really crunching beat.  It was rather obvious that
720 these guys were way out of my league, but I began to doddle a bit 
721 anyway, as I didn't seem to have any place to go at the moment.  Behind
722 me I could hear the woman playing at the keyboards.  There was an 
723 almost tangible energy there, and it blended well with what the others
724 were doing.
725  
726 	I hadn't been paying much attention to how I was playing, but
727 slowly the realization came to me that I was playing better then I had
728 ever done before.  My skills on the guitar were at best average, and
729 yet I was belting out a fairly complex counterpoint to the keyboards.  I
730 began to anaylze what I was doing, and  I flubbed several notes badly. 
731 Earing growled more loudly into the microphone while looking back my
732 way.  (Nothing he said seemed to be inteligible.)  I tried to relax. 
733 my fingers began to fly over the strings again.  After that
734 I just decided to enjoy what I was doing. 
735  
736 	Two hours passed, and I was really feeling fatigued.  It
737 was begining to look like I was going to be late with my paper.  We'd
738 gone through better then a dozen songs, though they were all a blur in 
739 my mind	by that time.  These guys seemed to favor the major cords.  I 
740 didn't recognize any of the songs, so I assumed they were all origionals.
741  
742 	My fingers were nearly raw when the rehearsal finally finished.
743 Numbly I was led from the stage, and into a vehicle of some sort.  My
744 guitar case was placed beside me carefully by the bassist.  He gave me
745 a dirty look, and I got the impression he didn't approve of my 
746 forgetting it. I got the distinct impression in fact, that he liked it
747 a good deal more then he liked me.
748  
749 	My legs were chained to the steel seat I sat in, and the
750 woman who had played keyboards was shackled in the opposite corner.  I
751 could feel the vehicle begin to move.  Suddenly the drowsiness overcame
752 me.  Later I found out I had been drugged.
753  
754 	When I awoke I was in a room much like my dorm room.  I wasn't
755 restrained, and I was needing a rest room.

864  
865 	The next several days passed rapidly, and I learned a great
866 deal about this strange place I had been thrown into.
867  
868 	It seemed I was not the only person who had come upon this
869 world strangly.  Most of the people in the building had a story of
870 some sorts to tell, though none quite as colorfull as my own.  One
871 guy I met had been snorkling when he found himself in the middle
872 of a puddle staring up at two fellows much like the ones who had
873 greeted me.  
874  
875 	It turned out that we where housed in a large complex.  The 
876 population was around 3000.  The cavemen (As our captors were called.)
877 only came in on rare occasions.  The day to day running of the complex
878 was left up to us.  There was one exit, and it was heavily guarded on
879 the outside.  All neccesities arrived through this one bottleneck. 
880  
881 	It didn't take me long to discover one of the more intersting
882 facts about what was going on around me.  
883  
884 	I was talking to Lydia (The Keyboardist) the day after my 
885 arival.  We'd been talking about the way things worked.
886  
887 	"They come to the door, hand a piece of paper to whoevers on 
888 duty at the door.  It will contain the names of however many people
889 they want.  The call goes over the intercomm, and when you hear you're
890 name you show up pronto at the door."
891  
892 	"What happens if somebody doesn't show?" I asked.
893  
894 	"They come in, find them, and beat the sh*t out of a half a 
895 dozen or so innocent people.  Then they drag them out and have them 
896 do whatever it was they wanted them to do."
897  
898 	"I'd imagine anybody who refuses is very unpopuler."
899  
900 	"Occasionally they end up dead, and its not the cave men 
901 that do them in either."
902  
903 	"Seems Harsh."
904  
905 	"This is a harsh world."	
906  
907 	Another fascinating discovery was still to come however.

922 All: Michael and Company are in stasis,  considering the permutations of the 
923 Pyrrix Paradox.  Until such time as the Cloaked Man's adversary, the Friar, 
924 can pull himself free from the diabolical permutations that have befalled him,

926  
927 And Now For Something Completely Different....
928 :::::=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::====
929      The man at the back of the filthy  restaurant pulled his hat over his eyes
930 in a mock attempt to avoid drawing any  attention to himself, as if that were
931 really possible.  His giant frame, half hidden in his huge green trenchcoat,   
932 was -always- bound to incit murmurs    from assembled onlookers. 
933      He'd learned, over time, to ignore their sibilant mutterings, just as he 
934 had learned to ignore almost everything that made up the disjointed group  
935 psyche of the States.
936      A fly landed on his table, sipping from a thick red puddle of spilled
937 drink.  Without hesitation, the man     slammed his hand down, crushing the 
938 insect before it could effect escape.   A satisfied grin crossing the man's    
939 half-concealed features, he resumed     his waiting, content in the knowledge  
940 that he had also satisfied the desire   of those assembled patrons for some    
941 utterlt trite cliched show of menace.
942      About half an hour later, another  man entered the establishment.  After
943 a precursory inspection of the confines of the room, including a check for 
944 quick escape routes, he limped over to  where the other man had been sitting.  
945      "Liechter!" the new arrival stammered.  "It really has been too long."
946      From beneath the shhadowy cover of  his fedora, Liechter eyed the arrival
947 cooly.  "Sandis." he responded at last.
948      Shifting uncomfortably in his seat, Sandis eyed the room once more.  
949 "Your taste for the melodramatic never  abates, does it?"  Slow, ponderous,    
950 each word seemed a struggle, as if great pain hid behind tfalsely jovial 
951 tone.
952      Liechter leaned forward, suddenly, his icy blue eyes callously observing
953 his companion.  "Nor does your damnable stammering.  I've learned to ignore it.
954 Point taken?"  
955      "You know the real reason I'm here." Sandis remarked, changing the
956 subject that had struck a nerve in his  associate.  "There's been some
957 activity in sectors that warrant your   attention.  I thought you should know  
958 before heading into something you can't handle."
959      "Can't ... handle?"  There was no  further response for a tense moment.
960 Liechter tipped his hat back slightly.  "Whatever do you mean?"
961      "The Group is on the move."
962      "Again, eh?  And so it goe."
963      "And there's more...."  Sandis gulped suddenly.
964      "...  "What exactly?"
965      "There may be some personell from  an outside source involved as well."
966      "Which... source."  Liechter's     pausing was beginning to wear on 
967 Sandis' nerves.
968      "I've heard rumblings that some    NET-"
969      Liechter tipped his hat completely back.  His free hand brushed away loose
970 bits of flesh from his right cheek,     pausing momentarily to rub at the two
971 deep red gashes that ran to the chin    along burnt lumps of skin.  "The Net?" 
972 he said, without the dramatic annunciation that Sandis had intoned.  "Ever     
973 since their last fiasco, they've been   little more than a whispered private   
974 joke, and you know it.  I'm surprised   that you even bothered mentioning it to
975 me."  Yet Sandis recognized a trace of  mild concern behind the blue eyes 
976 set deep within the recesses of Liechter's hellish features.  "Either way, I'm 
977 not going to involve myself in their    business unless they cross paths with 
978 my interests."
979      "I'm surprised that you'd take that tone, consideribf...." his voice
980 trailed off.
981      "This Meeting Is Over." Liechter   stated clearly.
982      The little man gathered his meager belongings and limped away, taking one
983 last glance back at his associate.  But the dark figure in the green coat was  
984 already lost behind the recesses of his fedora.
985      When Sandis had left, and some tima had passed, Liechter finally 
986 rose.  Quietly, he fished through a massive pocket and withdrew a few dimes 
987 and nickels and dropped them onto the  glass covering on the table.
