3 Welcome to BWMS (BackWater Message System)  Mike Day System operator
6                     THIS SYSTEM.
7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privatly owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system.
10 It is intended that the system be normally used for messages and
11 advertisments by the users. As the system is privatly owned, I retain the
12 right to remove any and all messages which I may find offensive
13 to me. Additionally because of the limited size of the system, it will be
14 periodically purged of older messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
15 The saved information will be cycled to drive 'B' while the information on
16 drive 'B' will be archived, and a fresh disk will be installed in drive 'A'.
17 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out
18 of the enter mode. The message is automaticly stored.
19 If after entering the message you find you made a mistake,
20 use the replace command to replace the line.
21 To exit from the system, type 'OFF' then hang up.
22 Type 'HELP' to see other commands that are available on the system.
23 ========================================

25 Leonard: 
26      I am at a real loss as to why you are experiencing the drop out.
27 The other users don't seem to be having the problem, several have tryed
28 it as have I and do not have that problem. By this, I can only assume
29 that the problem exists at your end. Are you running a smart modem?
30 If so maybe the data string is giving it fits. Or possibly the same 
31 for a smart terminal  program. Sorry I can't offer any more help then
32 to say it's all your fault, but I don't know what else there is.

35       the SUNDAY-TRADER
36      has a new phone number:
37         653-xxxx
38   and will be On-line Sunday for 24hrs
39      ---------------------------
40 Note: to the creeps out there that have been calling at times other than Sunday,
41  This new line does not have anything connected to it except the computer-
42 so you can call anytime (you just won't get an answer unless it's up). You
43 can also call the old number, (and incur the wrath of Ma Bell-- there's a
44 referral on it).

53 Dear CONCERNED:
54      Very Interesting, if true.  I'm not thrilled with ABATE (i have 
55 objections to someone smashing their brains out all over my car).
56 But the Hells Angels connection is new.  Can you document this? I
57 would be very interested in this information and would help spread the
58 word if I can get reprints of articles or can quote 60 Minutes or something
59 similar.

63 - Mikey, I have been expieriencing dropouts also. I am using  -
64 - a Hayes Smartmodem 300. I called up once, tried to ENTER    -
65 - something and it gave me "NO CARRIER". I called back, got   -
66 - about half way through and it said "NO CARRIER". I called   -
67 - back even after that, and entered the rest of the message.  -
68 - I was just about to EXIT and it gave me "NO CARRIER". I     -
69 - also get quite a bit of garbage on my end. I'm happy to say -
70 - that everything has cleared.                                -

73 HMMM.. could it be we had a bad line somewhere? How about you
74 Leonard, has your problem changed? I wonder what is causing
75 this latest surge of problems? Anyone else out there haveing
76 problems? (Getting thrown off or receiving garbage) (The normal
77 garbage you find here on BWMS doesn't count!).
78 Tron: if happens again, turn on the speaker of your smart modem 
79 to see how the signal sounds. You can do this by typing ATM2 before
80 you dial, or typing +++ then ATM2O if you are already on line.

143 Pioneer:  
144     Regarding four dimensional geometry, I would be willing to discuss
145 it with you if you will help me work out some theories on a new number 
146 system.  It is based on divisions by zero.  Weird things happen!
147 
148 
149 Charlotte:
150     About the term "ergonomics", it deals with the improvement of the
151 human/machine interface so that the user can more easily, quickly, and 
152 more efficiently enter in commands, data, etc.  It works both ways though,
153 it also deals with the efficiency of the output of the machine to the
154 user.  The case of Nan Davis however, does not quite fall into this
155 catagory.  For those out there who don't know of the case, Nan was
156 a senior at Wright State University last year.  A couple of years ago
157 she was in an accident that left her a paraplegic.  She got involved in
158 a research project at WSU where an Apple computer was used to send
159 impulses to her legs so that her muscles would contract and relax in
160 a certain sequence that was programmed into the Apple.  They finally
161 reached a point where her muscles had regained enough strength for her
162 to walk short distances.  In fact, she walked up to receive her diploma.
163 The problem with the system currently is that the computer, not she, 
164 controls where and how her legs move.  So there there is no feedback like
165 balance, fatigue, etc.  In fact, if she were to fall down, her legs would
166 keep going until she would be able to shut them down.  Obviously, much
167 more research is needed for this type of device.  But now, back to
168 ergonomics.  As I said before, ergonomics deals with the human/machine
169 interface.  Much research is also needed in this field also for both
170 the handicapped (who have been all but forgotten in most research to date)
171 and the rest of us.  Did I type ALL that?  Talk to you later...

206 Hello, Zero. I have already been here, hope to hear from you
216 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
217 Phantom:
218 I'd love to give you the documentation you asked for, unfortunately
219 the source I obtained it from is not available to the general public.
220 I'll try to research the matter further and see if I can't find
221 something for you.  As a sidelight you might take a look at the
222 news the next time ABATE is having a press conference and notice
223 how many people present are members of local outlaw motorcycle
224 gangs...It could be enlightening.
225                   CONCERNED CITIZEN
226 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
227 
233 To person asking for BWMS to be rewritten:
234 Sorry, what you see is what you get. The code resides in ROM, 
235 And I have no way of doing anything about it. I suggest you
236 spend your efforts in trying to get those who type all the
237 way out to the 128th column to back off a bit.

419 Mikey: I'd already figured out that it was at my end when I left
420 the last msg. I'm wondering if anyone can figure out why that one
421 bit pattern would cause the trouble. (I suspect the term prog
422 because LF doesn't cause the prob & is also the only one
423 of the chars involved that requires "special" processing by the
424 prog).
425 	
426 	Anyone thinking of interfacing the $32 "robot arm" from
427 Radio Shack to a computer? At the price, it looks like it could
428 be fun (not terribly useful, but fun).
429 _______________________________Leonard__________________________
430 Hey Mikey, I forgot to hangup & re-initialized the prog to auto
431 logon to another system. When I tried to get dumped (so I wouldn't
432 have to mess with my multi-line jury-rig), I couldn't! I'm going
433 to make one more test. & if that checks out I'll raise hell with

468   When I was in High Schoooooool just a few years agooooooooo, good old Miss
469 Hardy told us all about the fourth dimension (and the fifth dimension, etc.)
470 There is no mathematical reason to discount the existence of the fourth 
471 dimension.  The hard part is trying to visualize more than threeeeeeeee of 
472 the darn things.  It has something to do with the concept of N-dimensional
473 mutually orthogonal vector space.  
474   The same hassles reappeared about 4 years after that when Dr. Alexander
475 at OSU kept telling us about things like magnetocrystalline anisotropy, when
476 he had previously told us everything was assumed to be linear, homogeneous,
477 and isotropic in n-dimensional mutually orthogonal vector space.  
478   If someone mentions tensors... flunk him!!

481 I just saw a show on PBS.  The lead-in had a warning:  "The following program contains material that may be objectionable to 
482 some viewers."  While I appreciate their honesty, I wish other shows would be similarly forthright.  Example, "The following
483 program contains material that..."
484 	1.	"...may be very boring to most viewers..."
485 	2.	"...may be in extremely poor taste to all viewers..."
486 	3.	"...may be unbelievable to anyone over the age of 13..."
487 	4.	"...is definitely useless to 99.44% percent of the populace..."
488 
489 	Maybe someday we'll at least get a warning.

509 HELLO! My name is Rodney King.  I am travelling around the country and sharing
510 
511 information and ideas through bulletin boards.  This is a great deal of fun and
512 
513 a continuing opportunity to meet interesting people.  At the moment I am looking
514 for people who want to share ideas, information, wisdom or personal experience
515 
516 with others in this manner.  If you have something you think I ought to enter
517 
518 into bulletin boards around the country, drop me a message on this system,
519 
520 the Bit Bucket (761-xxxx), or CBBC/NW (284-xxxx) and I will see what I can do.
521 
522 Peace!

528 P.S. THE FOURTH DIMENSION MAY ACCOUNT FOR EXPERIENCES OF CLAIRVOYANCE,
529 
530 TELEPATHY, AND TELEKINESIS. THE MIND MAY BE A LINK TO THE FOURTH DIMENSION
531 
532 THROUGH A MEANS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD BY SCIENCE.  SCIENCE, AFTERALL , IS LIMITED
533 
534 BY ITS MANDATE FOR EMPIRICAL OBJECTIVITY, WHICH IS NOT POSSIBLE WHEN DEALING
535 
536 WITH THE MIND AS A PROJECTOR OF REALITY.  SUBJECT-OBJECT SEPARATION IS A MYTH.

540  1> I am appalled at the lack of logic and imagination evident in
541  2> today's world leaders.  Where are the people who have good
542  3> ideas and good heads on their shoulders?  It is clear to
543  4> me that sooner or later we are going to learn how to live
544  5> together without constant military threats. The question that
545  6> needs to be asked is: WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT WE CAN 
546  7> LEARN HOW TO LIVE TOGETHER PEACEFULLY? 
547  8>     It is not simply a matter of asking the question once or
548  9> twice a year.  We need to ask the question of every intelligent

550 11> comes up with a potential answer to the question, and we will
551 12> look at some I have come up with, they need to be publicized

558  1> (Cont. from MSG.#4890)  Some ideas to answer the question:
559  2> WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE  SO THAT
560  3> WE CAN LEARN HOW TO LIVE TOGETHER PEACEFULLY?
561  4>     1. Establish a means of competing fairly in a non-militar-
562  5> istic arena, perhaps space manufacturing or ocean mining.
563  6>     2. Use the high technology communication satellites to
564  7> "PROPAGANDIZE" or "PROGRAM" populations into accepting peace
565  8> and rejecting war and violence.  Teach us it doesn't pay to
566  9> wage war or to take human life.  Use History as the base.
567 10>      3. Encourage international cultural exchange through 
568 11> student cooperative programs, scientific and political forums.
569 12>      4. Spend alot more money on the Foreign Service
570 13> and the education and training of diplomats.
571 14>      5. Give terrorists and potential terrorists access to the 
572 15> media only if they abandon their violent intentions.
573 16> Encourage the discussion of radical and uncoventional views.

598          over-confidence,for it leads to inquiry,and inquiry leads to
599         invention.

605  
606  
607  
608 SO WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS,  WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY AND WHAT CONCLUSIONS HAVE YOU DRAWN?
609  
610  
611  
612 CONCLUSIONS I HAVE DRAWN:
613  
614 1.  ANY INDIVIDUAL CAN BECOME AS POWERFUL AS HE/SHE WANTS TO BECOME.
615  
616 2.  OUR MINDS ARE PROJECTORS OF REALITY...WHAT WE THINK IS WHAT COMES INTO
617     BEING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF PHYSICS, ETC.
618  
619 3.  ATTITUDES AND SPIRITUALITY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING.
620     IF YOU WANT TO GROW SPIRITUALLY YOU MUST CULTIVATE AND DEVELOPE THE
621     RIGHT ATTITUDES:  I.E.  LOVE YOU NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.
622  
623 4.  PEOPLE ARE BIOCOMPUTERS:  WE OPERATE ON THE PROGRAMMING WE RECEIVE.
624 THE PROGRAMMING IS CALLED BY MANY NAMES ... TRAINING, EDUCATION, MEDIA, ETC.
625  
626 5.  THE BIGGEST MOMENT IN HUMAN HISTORY IS RIGHT NOW.  WE ARE BEING BORN INTO
627     THE SOLAR SYSTEM WITH SPACE TRAVEL, SPACE MANUFACTURING, TELECOMMUNICATIONS,    EXPLORATORY SATELLITES, ETC.
