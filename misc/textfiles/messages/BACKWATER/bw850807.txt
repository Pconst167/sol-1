38   There are certain times when propriety tends to go by the boards in any
39 person's life.  The piper, normally one of the more staid members of the
40 ragtag riffraff that comprise the typical society of Innisfal, had as an
41 excuse only the strain under which he had been laboring.  True, reality had
42 been shifting and bending around him, but as an experienced adventurer he
43 really should have been more hardened to the shifting and changing of mutable
44 reality.  In addition, he had been laboring under quite a large degree of 
45 mental coerceion. (spell check -- where are you when I need you?  Dictionary
46 presently unavailable.)  His mind seemed rather numb from the after effects
47 of the mental control that had been used on him.
48   Ignoring, for the moment, the rest of the crew, he had seated himself
49 (a bit awkwardly, he would admit) on the floor in an out-of-the-way corner
50 of the pell mell.  With the avid grasp of a drowning man reaching for air,
51 he had rummaged in his sporran.
52   For those unused to the piper's costume, he normally wore a loose shirt,
53 a kilt, a plaid (a large tartan cloth folded into a narrow strip, wrapped
54 round his chest and over one shoulder falling nearly to the ground) and
55 a small wallet on a waistbelt (called a sporran) worn at the front of the
56 kilt.  His nearly knee-high hose and dirk (an 18 inch razor sharp blade
57 carried in a scabbard that also held a small fork and spoon) set with
58 cairngorm glowing in the pommels, and the matching glow from the skean
59 dubh from the hose on the calf of his right leg completed the picture.
60   As he rummaged in his sporran (a container that, common to many containers
61 carried by experienced adventurers, had an inside considerably more 
62 commodious than the exterior dimensions would lead one to believe possible)
63 looking for a restorative, he uncovered several bottles.  Now to the
64 uninitiate, Scotch whiskey for medicinal purposes may seem identical to
65 Scotch whiskey for recreational use, or Scotch whiskey for relief from
66 boredom, or even Scotch whiskey for hospitality.  The piper's subsequent
67 actions certainly belie that assumption.
68   In his search for a restorative, Scotch whiskey for medicinal use, the
69 piper had disturbed his arraingement of bottles.  Sadly in need of the
70 potent restorative, he had neglected to restore order until the precisely
71 measured dosage (three swallows) began to take effect.  Carefully wiping
72 off the top of the bottle with the heel of his hand, the piper secured the
73 top of the bottle and with a quiet "gurgle" it was restored to its niche
74 in the sporran.  The much-relieved piper then began to straighten the 
75 disarray that his hasty search for Scotch whiskey for medicinal purposes
76 had caused.  One by one, he stowed items away until he came to several
77 bottles of Scotch whiskey for non-medicinal purposes.  (Jealous of space,
78 he had stored mostly these non-exclusive-use containers rather than the
79 specialized types such as Scotch whiskey to present to visiting nobility.)
80   Thinking that he detected a feel of moisture along one of these bottles,
81 the piper withdrew it from his sporran to examine more minutely.  Trying
82 the top, he unscrewed the top with almost no effort.  Lifting the open
83 bottle to his lips, he drank deeply while examining the inside seal in
84 the cap.  It appeared to be intact, so he took another deep drink and
85 carefully examined the glass rim of the partially empty bottle.  Unable to
86 find a reason for any leakage, the piper took another drink and reinspected
87 the seal of the cap, then the bottle rim again.  Nothing.  Struck by sudden
88 inspiration, the piper held the bottle up to the light to search for hairline
89 cracks in the glass.  His inspection hampered by the nearly quarter-bottle
90 of amber fluid, the piper drank the remaining liquid in the bottle to
91 make it easier to inspect.  He was still trying to find defects in the
92 glass of the bottle when his head slumped to the deck of the pell-mell and
93 his thunderous snores seemed to shake a carved panel depicting a rather
94 furry fellow disporting with two (ahem) thinly clad (ahem) decidely female
95 persons in a manner that not too many years ago American society would have
96 rewarded with a jail term somewhat longer than that meeted out for 
97 involuntary manslaughter.

118     "Halloa!" Trainor called. "We are almost there. Bard, kick in the shift
119 dampers, quick stops can ruin your whole day."
120     It was obvious that Trainor was in much better spirits than he had been
121 a few hours before. The problems with the crew seemed pretty much cleared
122 up. There was still the slight formality of everyone knowing who everyone
123 else was, but that would soon be taken care of. Bard seemed to handling the
124 controls of the Pell-mell quite well. Piper was off in the corner in a
125 state of convalescence. Emu and Scarlet Lion were engaged in deep
126 conversation. And two adventurers Trainor didn't know were seated in
127 the rear of the Pell-mell near some florid carvings of anatomy.
128     Yes, Trainor thought to himself, with companions like these I am sure
129 we can defeat the evil anomaly from ZEB...
130     Trainor's line of thought was intersected by a frantic call from the
131 Bard. "Trainor! Get over here. I am getting some strange readings from
132 the temporal interchange meter. I have never seen numbers like these before.
133 What could it mean?"
134     Trainor's voice was strained but clear. "We were on course for my home
135 planet/reality at 5-jump intervals. Now these numbers would suggest that
136 our course has drifted, or been altered, due to some large reality-pool.
137 The last time I saw numbers even close to those was..." A look of terror
138 crossed Trainor's face. His eyes burned with a fever of thought. "was when
139 I burst through the ZEB zone, just after I pulled the entity through in
140 my space."
141     Emu spoke up. "You mean that thing is close?"
142     "That is very likely. Either that thing is close by or it caused
143 this pool when it passed."
144     Piper had awoken, and although looking the little worse for wear, pressed
145 his way to Trainor's side. "What do we do now?"
146     Trainor paused for just a moment. "I don't know for sure. I thought one
147 of you might have an idea."

150 oh my god!  What is the world comming to when the Piper writes such a
151 long entry?  What's going on here?!?  I myself, and probably many others
152 have modeled ourselves after the great Piper.  We kept our entrys short and
153 to the point, saying what we wanted to say and that's all.  But what do we do
154 now?  The image has been smashed!  And above all there are new users on the
155 board?  Arrgrgrhrhhh!  HI, MY NAME IS TOOTSY, CAN YOU HELP ME BE POPULAR AND
156 A ALL 'ROUND NEET PERSON?  I think I'm going to throw up?  Whatever happened

160      Ah, yes... whatever happened to reading the help file... 
161 
     We were *all* new users at one time, so I see little sin in not know-
162 ing everything about the use of a system.  We are all at different levels of
163 knowledge and ability, so little is to be gained by negativism.  Just relax
164 and let the newer user learn, offer a helping hand when necessary (in the
165 manner the Piper used) instead of rude commentary, and all will benefit.

166      As far as long entries go, I rather enjoyed Piper's little adventure in
167 Innebriland.  And it appears that images weren't the only thing that was
168 smashed in that story!

179 Not only do we have writers here but comedians too.  Whhen I asked for a re
180 sponse I was just looking for someone to communicate with.  You know just 
181 some idle chit chat.  I'm not hip to computer bullitin board etiquette, 
182 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
183     From Prometheus; Shoved
184     Perhaps it is the summer heat.  It could be the influx of
185 new people.  Maybe I am simply getting ornery in my old age.  I
186 am not sure what it is, but something seems very, very wrong.
187     I find myself becoming annoyed at simple spelling errors,
188 and at people who write obsecenely large amounts every day.  It
189 is not that important that it should aggravate everyone.
190     And if it is not too hypocritical, I would like to say a
191 few things about how this could be changed.  These suggestions
192 are only suggestions.
193     No one is willing to change for other people's sake.  And
194 when people refuse to change, and expect others to change, it
195 aggravates everyone involved.  This is what caused the greater
196 reality shifts lately.  In my opinion, at least.
197     It would be simple for people to adopt better spelling, if
198 it seems to be a problem.  And margins are too trivial to be
199 major emotional isssues.  And of course, not taking artistic
200 liscense with other people's opinions, and actions.
201     All I am saying is to try to be more agreeable, and when
202 you think something ought to be said, do it in between borders
203 under a character.  Which would probably ruffle less feathers.
204     Assorted messages follow.
205     Man in Gray; My father seemed quite agreeable about the ink
206 blotters we mentioned, and the resident aliens were impressed
207 with my knowledge of caustic liquid agents.
208     Guardian; Once upon (note proper spelling) a time, you said
209 a friend of yours could get ahold of paint pellet guns.  I am
210 in the market for one, and it appears I have some money for it.
211     Zephyr; Take heart, and please do not think I am angry. I
212 have said what I have said in states of grumpiness beyond most
213 people's immaginations.  Although maybe not beyond yours.
214     Kathyd; I wonder what it is that I am supposed to say over
215 there.  I guess it is something about the Great Peanut Butter
216 Missile Crisis now transpiring.  Sounds dandy to me.
217     Piper; Regardless of what other people have said, I liked
218 your entry a great deal.  It is rare that omething gets me to
219 lagh out loud anymore.
220     Whomever it is that claims to be new; To help in adressing
221 mail, usually people leave a special line above what they have
222 to say, and a line afterward.  A name is usually included, and
223 the whole thing is called a border.  The border ought to be a
224 distinctive thing, so that people will know who is talking.

229      Something for thought.....
230 I think at the time dropping the bomb on 
231 Hiroshima was a good idea, but the future
232 should have been of consideration.
233 Are we being plagued in epidemic porportions buy ignorance?
234 T(IGNORANCE wasn't the word I was looking for but it's all that would c
235 come to mind.)
236 The team of scientist who constructed the first atomic bomb knew that a
237 larger bomb was soon to come yet they built the bomb anyway.
238 T H E  G R E A T  P E A C E  K E E P E R

244 Isabell ignored the appearence and the dissappearence of the Pell-Mell.  A feat
245 that I was not able to match.  The exotic styling of the thing was, spectacular
246 to say the least.
247    Although, when it dissappeared, I was left with no idea where it had gotten
248 to.  For that matter, I was left with no idea *when* it had gotten to either.
249 
250    I sat on the grass that the Pell-Mell had crushed.  Isabell started chewing
251 on it.  Cropping it lower and lower until she had eaten most of the spot where
252 the romanesque, picturesque vehicle had made it's impression.
253    And it left quite an impression, a dozen people must have scratched their
254 head in wonder at it. I think the little cupid on the front was the cutest
255 fixture.  Or perhaps it was the grated window toward the front, aas it tapered.
256    I began to think about describing the thing in pen and ink when it occured
257 to me.  A machine of this, gaudiness would surely have been documented in some
258 reference work.  Especially if it were time hopping with a crowd like the one
259 that had just departed.
260     If I could find some mention of it, in some book, somewhere, sometime, I
261 could rush to that spot and meet the Pell-Mell and my fellow adventurers.
262     The only person who might have a library so large as to mention the Pell-
263 Mell was the Sage, whom I had met a dozen times in the Inn.  He mentioned
264 living close to here once apon a time.  Perhaps it was time to visit the old
265 boy.

270 the dropping of the first Atomic Bomb was necisary from our point of view - 
271 to save American lives that would be lost if we were to invade.  But for some
272 reason I'm glad we did drop the Bomb then, the first one.  The second one was
273 just to prove we weren't joking, as if they couldn't figure it out.  but 
274 anyway, if that bomb wasn't dropped then what would people of today associate
275 nuclear war with?  All we would have is theories of what might happen in the
276 nuclear fallout.  Leaders of today would see it a chalage to drop a thermo
277 nuclear device on somebodies head, it would be a great way to see what happens.
278 nuclear war is horrible and stupid, at least we know that now.  We had to learn
279 the hard way at other people's expense.

281 Now tell me one thing...  What is so bad about the Soviet Union?  Why are
282 American people so scared of the soviets?  And please don't say it's just
283 plain 'wrong' because I'll ask you to tell me what 'wrong' is and what you'r
284 basing it on.     --  If there was a full nuclear war, wouldn't it be better
285 for the U.S. to just sit and take it?  If we didmn't do anything there would
286 be suvivors that could continue the human race.  Doesn't that sound like a
287 good idea, letting the human race live on?
288 --------------\=-\=-inmo\=-
289 A note to the person above:  There's is nothing just plain "wrong" with the
290 Soviet Union.  But, the fact is, our country is founded on different laws,
291 morals, ethics, etc.  Therefore, a country which conficts with these creates
292 at least a small amount of turmoil because they do not stand for all the 
293 
294 things that we stand for.  Natually, because do not support their goverment's
295 way of opperating, this creates problems.  But, that has nothing to do with
296 them just being wrong.  It has to do with what is right in our eyes.  And,
297 communism is a big no-no in a captialist society, for obvious social and
298 economic reasons.  (I think you know enough about them that you don't want 
299 me to go into the terrible things about their government).  Even if there
300 weren't that many valid reasons which we could chalk up against them, being
301 different is enough of a reason for misunderstanding which results in
302 conflict.  (It causes so many others.  Why not in politics, too?)  But, hey...
303 they don't think we're all that great either. -- A word for stars and stripes

305     A friend of mine was riding on the bus. The bus was quiet, and most of the
306 riders were gazing out the windows. On the sidewalk, alongside the bus, a boy
307 was riding a skate board. Before him, a small girl appeared. She was only 
308 about five years old. The boy attempted to turn on his skate board to avoid
309 the girl. In doing so, he fell of the board and landed most uncomfortabley 
310 splattered on the sidewalk.
311     A man on the bus, who was wearing a business suit, turned to no one in
312 particular and said, "If he wasn't riding that thing that never would have
313 happened. He could of knocked the girl down! I tell you, if man was meant to

315 met a few grunts of people who had also witnessed the could have been fatal

323 Hello You All,
324   I am new on this system and I have been reading the things you have in here. 
325   The pipers little story was pretty good, I have not completly finished 
326 reading it ,but hope to later.
327   As for my opinion about the nucleur bomb..
328   I think that it was a way of showing other nations that we mean bussiness when
329 say that we want to stay in PEACE and not be at WAR..
330  Maybe the dropping of the bomb will make others realize we mean bussiness.
331  The only thing that I think they should of done is wait to drop it because if
332 they would of droped it on the rajneish
333 it would of acomplished more!!!!!!
334                      LATER.???!!!!

350   The atomic bombs dropped on Japan were not an attack on the Japanese milatary.
351 They were an attack on non-military targets in order to demoralize the Japanese
352 people.  Obviously they succeeded.  Because our terms for peace included the
353 acquiescence of the emperor, which the Japanese regard as a direct desendant
354 of God, they were unexceptable without such brutal flagrantes of our power.
355 In my opinion, what we needed at the time, rather than a new weapon, was some
356 small understanding of the Japanese people.

374 Upon regaining what passed for conciousness in states like these, the piper

376 trick on him in his helpless condition.  
377   "Grrmph" he articulated clearly.  "Mffgrakkk.  Uuhhooorghhh!"
378   Rolling over, he began to pry himself towards a vertical position, at
379 the same time attempting to open his stuck eyelids.  Those overworked orbs
380 flinched mightely upon once more being exposed to light, but saved the
381 piper the painful fate of literally sticking his nose into someone's
382 (rather realistically carved) business.  Pulling back slightly, he found
383 himself staring at the finely crafted scene.
384   "I'd heard of that, but didn't think it possible... " he muttered
385 under his breath.
386   "So that's the way..."
387   "Oh, my!!  But to be that limber..."
388   Voices from the control board of the machine penetrated the piper's
389 concentration and interrupted his study of anatomical conjunctions just
390 as his mind was beginning to reel under possibilities that he had never
391 considered before.  A fading instinct for self-preservation dragged him
392 to the control panels to hear the last of the exchange between the
393 Bard and Trainor.
394   "So what do we do?" mumbled the piper, looking at the meaningless
395 gagues and readouts.

398 The Soviet Union has nothing to fear from a country whose educational system
399 is in so poor of shape as to produce the writers I read on this system. Behind
400 every bomb is a brain, and it is up to those brains to launch those bombs.
401 Our loveable President only decides when to shoot, he doesn't do the actual
402 shooting. If a cross section of our populace is shown in the users of this
403 system, I would estimate that only 1 out of 5 seem to demonstrate any real
404 knowledge of grammer and semantics. Arguments about 'nucleur' weapons and
405 dropping the bomb on 'hiroshma' are as bloody pitiful as those who seem
406 destined to enter them.

459 ________________________________________this is kind of fun,for the first time
460 I guess I leave a print on the screen
461 
462 well so much for a word or two GOOD-BYE!!!!!!!!!!
463 ________________________________________
464 I have to tell you how I feel
465      and also show my love is real
466 We play pretend so much it seems
467      that when we really find our dreams
468      we trip and fall on every line
469      and sound so silly half the time
470 I've searched, explored each avenue
471      in hopes a perfect girl like you
472      would show up seeking the same things
473 which I hold true and know that bring
474 respect and joy, that lovers need
475 to grow and learn and help and feed
476 from one another every day
477 on to our children every way
478 We must take hold of what is true
479      and care for it and nuture too
480      and not get lost in all our wants
481      to let go by a love that haunts
482      us day and night and then some more
483      to let it just walk out the do
484 door
485 You might be thinking "What a fool
486      to use a poem as a tool"
487 But love, my dear, is shown in ways
488      that people have forgot these days
489 I've often thought in days gone by
490      that love was lost, the well"s gone dry
491 But thanks to you, a spark, a flame
492 Hey, maybe you do feel the same
493 And when I'm making love to you
494     I nknow you'll feel the same way too

498 To the above person talking about the
499 beeping in the middle of their lines:
500 the beeping is caused by trying to add
501 text after reaching the right hand
502 margin setting.  To change the setting
503 of the margin, enter "MA " and any
504 number from 7-127.  The number is how
505 many chars you can type on a single
506 line.  Hope this is of some help.  If
507 not, at least I tried...

515 This is getting sad!
516 Drop a bomb on Oregon?  What a dumb idea!  A nuclear bomb just doesn't blow
517 up, destroy a bunch of stuff, then go up in a cloud of smoke and be done with.
518 People really don't worry about that part of it.  It's the fallout that we're
519 scared of. A nice wind and one explosion could effect the whole state and maybe
520 another one also.  Poeple who weren't in the town of rashneesh would be dying
521 from radiation.  The winds (if going north) would carry the radioactive 
522 particles which would cantaminate our food, we would be eating out of cans for
523 months, years.  - That was just a briliant idea!  
524 By the way, who appointed you as God?
525 \=-\=-
526 If nuclear war is going to break out it will not be between the Soviet Union
527 or the United States, it will be because of some trird world country that
528 has a couple terrorists with a bomb.  South Africa has the technology and the
529 radioactive metials to biuld a nuclear missle/bomb, it's there that our concern
530 should be!
531 \=-\=-
532 By the way, our government isn't to great either.  Like the CIA, they are doing
533 a fine job of keeping the world in total disorder, sticking their noses in 
534 other coutries business, our own business!  No doubt they would be just the
535 ones to send Terrorists the plans for a Mx or two.

551 A friend, more than a friend, much more. And yet she's a stranger. I reach out
552 to her, and grasp nothing but air. A shadow, a ghost of a woman. Is it to be
553 nothing more? Only a ghost for a friend? Only a shadow of love? Never to know
554 more? Why do I continue? Why do I bother? There is so little that is offered,
555 so little. At times I feel like a favorite hat that is put on only when desired
556 and then put back in the closet until next time there is a desire. Why do I
557 continue this madness? Why must love be so cruel? I'm a fool.
