23 Farley's face was a blank mask, kept so mostly by a vicious stubborn streak.
24 Other duty called him away from his passion; the strain between them hurt.
25 He resigned himself to the delay, finally composing his emotions into some
26 sort of whole just as the lift doors parted.
27 A few moments walk brought Eugene and James to conference room 10B, five
28 minutes early.  Ada was already seated, looking at a CD file viewer.
29 She looked up.  Her usually pleasant features sagged a little; she appeared
30 to have missed sleep recently.  She did not greet them with a smile as was
31 her habit, but instead came to the point.
32 "Ian's gone, and with him a stack of CD files.  I've been going over the
33 index of their contents," she nodded toward the viewer, "and most of the
34 material is the drop-dead-before-reading sort.  We MUST regain them, preferably
35 Ian also.
36    "Parity and Fellows have not returned yet, so I am forced to send you two,
37 as a team, after Ian.  I'll send Fellows and Parity after you, but someone
38 is needed in the field after him NOW.  Any questions?"
39 James spoke up.  "Any leads on him yet?"
40 Ada shook her head.  "None.  NET has been monitoring communication channels,
41 making inquiries, talking with connections.  He did not leave an easy trail,
42 gentlemen.  So far, we haven't been able to FIND the trail."
43 Farley let this seep in, slowly allowing his self-pity drain out to be
44 replaced with purpose.  "I see.  Nothing else, Ada?"
45 "Nothing.  Good luck, gentlemen, I've told Supply you would be checking out
46 equipment."  With that, Ada returned to the viewer.
47 Only minutes later, Garret and Farley were in supply, choosing their tools-
48 of-trade carefully, preparing for one of the greatest chases of NET's history.

65 HI EVERYONE!! It's story time!
66 
67 I know how hard it is to come in on the middle of a story and not know what is
68 going on. Well, I have the solution. The all purpouse, in one shot medium length
69 story. If you miss this entry, you won't have to labor in trying to catch up, 
70 and if you happene to catch this entry, well, it will tell you the meaning of  
71 life, the key to happiness, as well as totally enrich and fufill you. So. There
72 it is, and here we go.
73 
74 
75   Once upon a time, long ago, there was a man. Yes, a man who would change the
76 very course and fibre of the universe. But enough of that: now we turn our 
77 attentions to one Phil Jones, a dime and nickle author of childrens books with 
78 such stupid titles as " Boober Bear"..  " Pitty Penguin ", and of course who 
79 could forget, even under heavy sedation, his masterwork " Sleazee Seal "? But 
80 enough of that, also. His books are of no interest to this story, but to add 
81 some cheap, tawdry gags.
82   Anyhow. One day, Phil, our hero, was looking up a word in the dictionary. But
83 this was no ordinary dixctionary. This was one of those big, fat, dusty kind of
84 tome that you find at the very back of the darkest corner of the library and ar
85 afraid to touch because you are sure that it is about five hundred years old 
86 and you have no idea who might have touched it with what, or what might slither
87 , scurry, scramble or fly, out. But Phil, being that kind of person that 
88 actually LIKES to look under big rocks at all the slimy creatures, had no such
89 inhibitions.
90   He was looking up the spelling of the word " LUST " for his new book. He had 
91 found it, logically, in the " L " section of this particular dictionary. Well,
92 this also happened to be one of those valuable antique dictionaries that you 
93 couldn't check out from the library without five pieces of I.D., references, a
94 pound of flesh and a presidential endorsment. But Phil, the optimist that he 
95 was, decided to appeal to the librarians sense of literary destiny.
96   She sat, 98 pounds of sheer ugliness, with a face that could bend wood, gave 
97 him a look that could curl sheet metal, and responded with a tart and caustic
98   " NO. "
99   Phil abandoned that idea, and for some reason was a wee bit queasy after the
100 encounter. But he knew that he could not commit the  spelling to memory: not
101 even with a pnemonic dece. So Phil was in a REAL pickle. What to do, what to
102 do. Suddenly, he resolved himself. In a descicive move, he tore the page bearin
103 the word from the book, tucking it quickly under his trenchcoat.
104   Suddenly, from the sky came crashes of thunder and blasts of light worthy of
105 the apocalypse. Unearthy wails emminated from the floor, Moans of agony issued 
106 from bleeding walls.
107   Figuring that he had tripped some expensive and obscure alarm system, Phil
108 tore out of there like a mouse in a slingshot. Unfortunately for him, he wasn't
109 around long enough to hear the message, shouted by an unearthy voice that 
110 reverberated off all the walls and shook the very fondations of the old 
111 building. It said..
112   " Uh Oh. "
113 
114   We find Phil in the dark hole of a slum tenement that he calls home sweet
115 home. Phil never got rich from writing: In fact, he has to pay the publishers
116 to print them. But he still quested after that elusive American Dream, the
117 promise of liberty and freedom that made the U. S. of  A. so Damn great. The 
118 dream that had Phil sitting in a hovel, slaving over a REALLY bad book. A book
119 unparallelled in idiocy. A book that, after one reading by a child, would cause
120 the parents of that child ( Now mentally unbalanced and unacceptable by even 
121 the broadest minded asylums..) to  take Uzi of M-16 in hand and seek out the 
122 man who carried ( Wisely) the pseudonym Bozo Billy. This is Our America.
123 
124   Anyhow. That is quite enough. Phil checks his swatch. 11:30. Ah. Just about 
125 time for a nice little lunch. Putting on his coat, he left for June's diner.
126 
127   " Well hello there, June. "
128   " Howdy yoorself, Philly. So What's goin' on? You're usually not here for 
129 dinner 'till 6:00. "
130   " I want some lunch."
131   " Lunch? "
132   " Yeah. Lunch. Midday repast. Eats. Food."
133   " At this hour? What a kidder you are, pally. I tell ya, we don't serve
134 dinner till 4:00. Now go on. Beat it. Scram. "
135   " June, I have been eatin' lunch here since I was a kid. What's the deal?"
136   " ZYou are nuts, Philly boy. There is no such thing as..Lunch whateveritis."
137 
138   Phil was puzzled by this turn of events. Until suddenlly...
139 
140   " HEre! " He pulled the dictionary page from his pocket. 
141   " Proof that there is such a thing as lunch!!"
142   She looked the page over carefully.
143 
144   LUNCH ( lunch ),n.1) any light meal; esp. the midday meal between breakfast 
145 and dinner.
146 
147   " You're still a LOON in my book. I've never heard of any of these things. "
148 she threw the page back in his face. " LUMP? Wait just a second..." She took 
149 page back and scrutinized one word carefully.
150   " Just a sec.." She said. " I have heard of one of these. " She crumpled up the
151 page and tossed it on the floor. 
152   " I HAVE heard of LUNKHEAD! Phil Jones!!"walked away. Phil picked it up and sat
153 down in one of the empty booths.
154   What have I done? He thought, smoothing the page. I must have destroyed all 
155 these things simply by tearing out the page. Suddnly, great joy filled his
156 heart. I can destroy Avarice, greed, hatred, war, and poverty! He smiled,
157 looking over what he had done unwittingly before moving on to bigger and better
158 things.
159   LUNA... So we lost the moon. In greek yet. No Sweat. LUNATIC. We still got
160 CRAZY.. 
161 
162   But as Phil's eyes roamed down the page, his hand suddenly tightened in a 
163 clutch at his chest.
164 
165   There, on the middle of the second side, was written the word LUNG.
166 
167   As the realization crept over him that he had obliterated LUNGS worldwide, 
168 the ancient curse took over. Everyone on earth died, except those with gills,
169 who in fact evolved to be the most intelligent and cultivated civilzAtion the 
170 universe ever did, does, or would know of.
171 
172 The Salamanders.
173 
174  I would say to be continued, but since this is the handy dandy sure shot one
175 entry short story, well, you will never know what the salamanders were like, or
176 who they were. Tough forks, my dear readers.
177 
178 Hope you All enjoyed it.

183 The following is *NOT* fake.  (And if you thought the above was odd...)=
184 .
185         The Comparmise of 1986
186 .
187     The Comparmise of 1986, Indian say "white man must be stupid he build big
188 fire, and sit way back, Indian build small fire sit real close, who could think
189 a simple quote could mean so much in 1986.  A fact Zachary Taylor 1784-1850,
190 12th president of the United States, and few presidents have entered office with
191 less knowledge of what was expected of them.
192     I would like to persuade voters that I am there best choise for Governor of
193 Oregon, and there are three specific reason.
194     Reason one Affirmative Action: any action that is intented to correct
195 effects of past discrimination, to eliminate present discrimination, or to
196 prevent discrimination in the future.
197     Reason two Environment: the coming together of all external and internal
198 condition affecting the existence , groth, and welfare of organisms.
199     Reason three Environmental Affirmative Action: action which deprive an
200 individual of emplyment or educational opportunities.
201     I would like to create adverse impace on environment by using 4/5 rule 4/5
202 rule is 20% White, 20% Black, 20% Hispanic, 20% Asain, 20% Indian American.  To
203 house specific people for specific reason in a place as large King Dome full of
204 apartments, and heated by wind power, and buy land from Bonneville Power
205 Administration, for 4 billion dollars.
206     Note: I would get Oregon out of the timber business, and into the farm
207 business, if you want me as you Governor please write friends, relatives, and
208 anyone who want change, ask them to move to Oregon.
209      Forthan in Portland for Governor

215     "Ahem."
216     "Er...What? Oh, its you Parity. I must have dozed off. Sorry 'bout that."
217 Fellows looked like he had just woken up from a long winter's nap.
218     "I realize this is the first chance at sleep you've had in almost three
219 days Fellows, but remember NET rule 15a: "NET agents may never doze off."
220     "Ya, sure Parity. Hey! I do believe you cracked a joke there. What's
221 wrong?"
222     "Ah yes, the famous Fellows jocularity. I AM capable of humor, sometimes.
223 And now, since we are about to land, why don't you hit the can and freshen
224 up a bit."
225     "I still can't believe where we are going Parity. Are you sure the plane
226 tickets said Las Vegas?"
227     "Yes they did. And you'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and
228 villainy."
229     "That sure sounds familiar. Have I heard someone say that before?"
230     "I couldn't say for sure. It was first said a long time ago, in a place
231 very far away. Who knows what twists the course of words over time."
232     A crackling voice broke the two agent's conversation. "WE'LL BE LANDING
233 IN TEN MINUTES. PLEASE EXTINGUISH ALL SMOKING MATERIALS AND PLACE ALL TRAYS
234 IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION. PLEASE STAY IN YOUR SEATS UNTIL THE PLANE HAS COME
235 TO A COMPLETE REST. THE TEMPERATURE AT OUR DESTINATION IS 76 DEGREES. WE
236 HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR STAY IN LAS VEGAS, AND MAY LADY LUCK BE WITH YOU!"
237     "Haha. Parity, did you catch that? What a cheery message. 'and may lady
238 luck be with you!' Sure."
239     "Come now Fellows. You sound awfully sore about something. Let me guess.
240 Have you, nah, yes! That must be it. You may have left your heart in San
241 Francisco but you lost your shirt in Vegas."
242     "Very intuitive Parity. But that was a long time ago too. I have changed
243 a great deal since then. And I know now to never try and fill an inside
244 straight."
245 
246     Walking from the plane to the terminal, Fellows and Parity soaked in the
247 sun's warming rays.
248     "Parity, do we get to sit around the pool and work on our tans or did
249 those plane tickets bring us here for a better reason?"
250     "We may get some tanning in Fellows, but this is mainly business I would
251 guess. Actually you know just about as much as I do. When the DC branch gave
252 me the tickets before I met you at the airport, they were pretty tight-lipped
253 about the whole thing. You know how those east coast personnel are."
254     The now warmed agents entered the air-conditioned terminal, where they
255 were greeted by loud shouts from the luggage area. A group of people intent
256 on something near the luggage wheel pushed and shoved for a better view.
257 Agents Parity and Fellows made their way to the source of the commotion.
258     "What in blazes? All this because someone's luggage was lost? That's
259 as American as apple pie."
260     "Not this time Fellows. I think this is a bit more serious. Watch
261 yourself."
262     "As always my friend."
263     As the agents got near enough to the congregation to hear what they were
264 saying, they also saw for themselves what all the bustle was about.
265     "Do you see what I see Fellows?" Going round and round between pieces
266 of Samsonite was the body of man, a rather large man. His face was down,
267 but the agents could make out a shock of dark black hair. Hair so black
268 that...
269      "I see it. Oh Hell, there's only one man I know who looks like that."
270      "Me too." said Fellows, as the agents pushed their way though the
271 crowd, weapons drawn, to take a closer look.

285     The brown-robed figure hesitated for a long, silence filled moment.  
286 The only sound that filled the room was the harsh breathing of the assembled
287 figures and the slow drip of sweat from brother Bob's closely shaven face.
288     "You have not curbed your appetites,
289 the low voice was icy and emotionless.  "You have achieved much.  You have 
290 a national following, your face and voice are well known.  Revenues from
291 your activities are second highest in the nation.  Your followers are 
292 malleable and responsive.  This alone protects you.  Last week, you accepted
293 an offer to dedicate a new church in a small town in Ohio.  People came from
294 miles around to hear your invocation.  The next day, you indulged yourself.
295 You were caught in the act.  Extraordinary measures were necessary."
296   The brown-robed figure moved quietly and a thin local newspaper appeared 
297 on the polished tabletop.

300     The Pleasantville Guardian joins the families and friends of those who
301 grieve after Monday's terrible tragedy.  Words cannot express the horror of
302 the scene at the Holyville disaster.  Nearly half of the inhabitants of that
303 small community were destroyed in the explosion of the fertilizer truck that
304 leveled the newly built Holyville Fundamentalist Church and destroyed most
305 of the buildings in this, our neigboring community.  Loss of life was high
306 and authorities are at a loss to explain the explosion.

355 	It worked, it's done. Now I feel sensational. I've got it now, it's
356 mine, this is it. They won't see it again all too soon either. And when they
357 do they won't know what to make of it. Grand, I'm on top of the world.
358 	Just a second. Relax, settle down. This is only the beginning of the
359 plan. Actually this is but a stepping stone of the plan. In order to have all
360 the events fall in place these matters must be taken cautiously. Having been
361 so daring as to attack the top man in the group, especially my own, was asking
362 for trouble.
363 	I wanted to change things long ago but too many stipulations existed
364 to keep me from doing so. No one man could possibly remain in charge of a
365 group and stay as free from internal strife as did the one person that stood
366 in my way.
367 	Didn't it all seem so simple to get things done the way I'd like? All
368 I had to do was remove the element restraining my objective and I'd be
369 in-like-Flynn. So to speak. But what was I to do since that element was the
370 top man? Remove him? Oh sure, right. Easier said than done, fella. This was
371 one big man, in more ways than one. And he wields more power than I first
372 thought. But remove him I must.
373 	Alright, think. I know what I have to do. Before I can do it I must
374 watch my my target, my element. And I did. I saw that he was getting fed up
375 with the hassles and of the daily rigor attributed to being in the front. and
376 there was also one other thing I knew. Yes, I remembered. This great leader
377 has the ability exhibit the facade of sheer calm in the presence of a chaotic
378 situation. It takes a strong man to do that, to bottle up all desires to just
379 throw hands in the air and give in. And he is strong. But there is one small
380 flaw I've found. He will give in.
381 	Once, in the formative years of his group, he took a vacation. This in
382 itself is of no import except that it was not a scheduled one. He simply
383 vanished. It was no chore to cover it up. Any office, given the time, can make
384 ends meet. They're doing it even now. Except this time it's not being handled
385 so smoothly. I knew he'd leave, he was bound to do it again sooner or later.
386 Later finally arrived.
387 	I'll be turning off the dictaphone now. I have a plane to catch for
388 Montegomery and I wouldn't want to have this contraption as part of my
389 carry-on luggage. Oh yes, that and my newly acquired top level identity badge.

411 
412 HEY YOU GUYS, IT SEEMS THAT MIKEYS SYSTEM HAS A PROBLEM. I AM USING THIS
413 ON A DEC PRO-350 AND IT SEEMS THAT EVERY LOWERCASE CHARACTER ON THE SYS
414 COMES OUT AS JIBBERISH ON THE SCREEN. ANYONE GOT ANY GUESSES???

420 Yeah, get a decent terminal. There's nothing wrong with the system.

423 THORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHORTHOR
424 Mr. Dent remur is correct. You most likely need a different terminal program
425 THOR has many and has run into that same malady. THOR has visited many
426 different lands and places where one terminal program is not the same on each.
427 It is always best to have a few backups in your napsack so that you can
428 communicate when visiting different INNS and lodges.
429 THOR wishes to say hello to GUARDIAN for it has been many seasons since last
430 his words have been read by him. Also if he has seen kathyd, please say
431 hello to her from THOR.

444 Swell, just as long as the IRS doesn't mark me. Thor, you might be surprised
445 to find out that kathyd is already aware of your presence and has already
446 been told 'hello' from you. Please be patient Thor, the almighty terminal
447 works in strange and sometimes slow ways.
448 						French Toast
449 ____________________________________________________________________________
450 Thor: Please note that he said "terminal", not "terminal program". There
451 are many people who use terminals, which pieces of hardware that can ONLY
452 be used for telecommunications. It is much more expensive to change one
453 of those than to change a program. 
454 ARTHUR DENT: CHECK YOUR SWITCH SETTINGS. YOUR TERMINAL MAY SUPPORT THE APL
455 CHARACTER SET. THIS MEANS THAT ALL YOUR LOWERCASE IS MAPPED TO A BUNCH OF
456 GREEK/MATH/WEIRD SYMBOLS.

476    Balnk faces stare at me as I walk down the street. Slaves for some
477 one. Working with no hope for a better life. Past a white, well kept-up
478 house. "Hey you, get to work. And take off those clothes," says a man
479 who appearently doesn't like anybody in anything but rags. "Sorry, I'm
480 not one of your slaves. You can't, and won't, controll me." "Get to work
481 befor I kill you." I pay no attension to him and keep walking. "BANG!!"
482 A bullet passes through me with no effect. Confused, I should be dead.
483 No effect? I turn around in anger. The man melts in my glare.
484    Now I feel a sharp pain in my stomach. Hot, burning, fire shoots through
485 me and I fall to the ground. A screen echos within me which, had it been
486 vocal, would have shaken the Earth to dust. 
487    The sun is glaring at me and I glare back. One explosion, far out in
488 space, and the planets fly out in every which way. Thoughts and planets
489 fly as one, far away, to be lost. They may become parts of other solar
490 systems or they may fall into stars and be gone. 
491    The Earth is black and cold. No sun to heat it. The heart freezes. 
492 Am I dead yet?

541  
542   As I walked up to the door, I pulled out the poster and the nails to put
543 it up.  The poster says :

548                  Jay Wire.  A muscular white man.  Age 29.
549                  Stands about 6'2".  about 200 lbs.  Long 
550                  black hair, a little longer than hiois

558 a black leather biker's jacket.  I have a lazer sited 9mm in its holster,
559 on my right lag.
560   I walk over to a table were six men are sitting.  One ask, "What the hell
561 do you want?"  
562   "I need a six good bountyhunters.  I am willing to pay 1/2 a million dollars
563 to the person that find this man," I hand them each a poster, like the one on
564 the door.  I put a brifcase up on the table, and open it to show them that I
565 havee half a millon dollars.  "If you are intressed then call me @ 824-6842.

584 A few hours later, Farley and Garret were straining the eyes of NET (and
585 their own) looking for any clue to Mr. MacHinery's whereabouts.  Eugene's face
586 seems grim and he perhaps is clutching a bit tightly on the steering wheel.
587 James idly polished his semi-automatic while whistling out of tune; he wonders
588 about "what's eating Farley".  'Must be he's nervous about the importance of
589 this mission.  He'll get over it.'
590 As if on cue, the COMSET beeps demandingly for attention.  Garret taps in his
591 id sequence.
592 <Agents J.Garret and E.Farley: a body closely resembling Mr. MacHinery has
593 been found.  Parity and Fellows are handling it.  Your revised instructions
594 are to continue investigating locally in search of the CD files, which have
595 not been found on the body.   -A.Lovelace>
596 The COMSET fell silent.
597 "Poor Ada.  I think she somehow blames herself for this.  She feels she must
598 supervise the whole recovery operation personally."  -Farley, at the wheel.
599 "Yah, I think you're right.  This mess is rough on everybody."
600 The agents pass by a popular music store, one of the largest in the region.
601 "Hey, Eugene.  Park over there and let's look in the store.  I've been
602 thinkin' about how a stack of CDs could be hidden and moved, and I can't
603 think of an easier way than to include them in a store shipment.  Or put
604 them on a "foreign music" rack and let the carrier buy them, one at a time..."
