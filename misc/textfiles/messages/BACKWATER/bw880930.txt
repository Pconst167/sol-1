 24 Oh, boy!  I get to be the first one.  Wowie zoobers, man.
 25  
 26 Signer, I realize that religion is an act of faith in many senses.  But
 27 I don't understand how someone can have faith in something without a
 28 great deal of evidence showing that it is true.  I happen to see evidence
 29 all around me that indicates that nothing intelligent but this stuff
 30 together.  When I think logically about things, I come to the same
 31 conclusion.  But I'm always open to evidence that I may have missed, or
 32 lines of reasoning that I haven't thought of.  I'll admit that it's 
 33 going to take one hell of an argument to get me to change my mind.  But
 34 if you have that argument, I'll listen to you.  (Even if you don't, I'll
 35 listen to you as long as you're reasonable.)

 40 I think the problem is one of scale. I recently saw somebody give an example of
 41 a brocken watch in a dryer. It went to the effect that if you were to put a 
 42 brocken watch in a dryer and let it spin it would never again be whole. At 
 43 least after a few million years or so.
 44  
 45 While this is probably correct it fails to address the scale of the universe.
 46 For just a moment assume that without the shadow of a doubt we are the only 
 47 living intelagent life in the entire universe. Now, Given BILLIONS of years 
 48 the odds of Life emerging in the known universe suddenly become very good.
 49 The possibility of even intelagent life becomes very good. 
 50  
 51 Note that all this assumes that it is hard/nearly impossible for life to 
 52 emerge on a given planet. If it were in fact common there would be life 
 53 everywere.
 54  
 55 I am not saying that God does not exist, But I am saying that it does not
 56 take the existance of any sort of God to explain our being here.

214      "All rise..."  Chairs slide, feet scuffle, voices murmur, the

216      A woman sits in stunned silence at the defense table, her face
217 frozen.  She always knew intellectually that it might come to this,
218 but still she was emotionally unprepared for what had happened.
219      "Don't worry sweetheart, this isn't over yet," the slickness in a
220 Brooks Brothers suit whispers in her ear, a feral gleam in his eyes,
221 "we can wrap them up in appeals for years.  This is a test case, you
222 know.  They'll let it go all the way to the Supreme Court if
223 necessary.  What an opportunity!"
224      "Yes, what an opportunity," the woman responds in a quiet
225 monotone.  "I've always wanted to spend the rest of my life in court."
226      "Now look here you silly bimbo!  If you didn't want to wind up in

234 case had so much potential for career advancement I would never have
235 taken it when I got the call from the Legal Aid office."
236      The bailiff, accompanied by the courthouse matron, forces the

238 resist.
239      "Can I say one more thing to my lawyer before we go back?" the
240 woman asks quietly.
241      "Just be quick," the matron responds.
242      The woman leans forward until her face is only two feet from
243 her attorney's, makes an odd noise in the back of her throat, and
244 noisily deposits a load of phlegm on his face.
245      "There's a lot of genetic material in saliva too, creep!" she

260           TUNING OUT NON-IONIZING RADIATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH/SAFETY HAZARDS
261  
262                Growing evidence that long wave non-ionizing radiation used in
263           electromagnetic devices, microwave products, and TV/radio systems is
264           harmful to the public's health, hazardous to effective public safety
265           systems, and threatening to military security went largely unreported
266           by America's media in 1987.  Also underreported were the related
267           issues of the Environmental Protection Agency's shut-down of its
268           funded programs to study non-ionizing radiation in light of a 1989
269           deadline to establish safety standards for public exposure to radio
270           frequencies, and, the lawsuit brought against the Reagan
271           administration by a coalition of plaintiffs who charge that the
272           administration has violated the National Enviromental Policy act by
273           not adequately protecting the public and environment from the "Hazard
274           of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance" (HERO).
275                Studies that suggest links between electromagetic fields (such a
276           those produced by overhead power lines, broadcast towers, military
277           hardware, hairdryers, microwave ovens, computers, TV and two-way
278           radios, and radar), and cellular mutation, cancer, and childhood
279           leukemia have received little attention. University of North Carolina
280           epidemiologist David Savitz confirmed earlier reports about the
281           apparent public health hazard.  Savitz emphasized the need for furthe
282           research and more federal funding to determine the extent of this
283           potential health risk.  Fifteen of 17 occupational studies have
284           established links between exposure to low frequency electromagnetic
285           fields and cancer.  Despite this mounting evidence, the EPA shut down
286           its program to study non-ionizing radiation which is supposed to set
287           acceptable levels of exposure for humans and the environment by 1989.
288           Meanwhile, total federal funding to study the health effects of low
289           frequency fields has dropped from $10 million to just $2.5 million.
290                A coalition of Pentagon watchdog organizations and individuals
291           has brought suit against the government charging Reagan administratio
292           officials with willful negligence in protecting the public from the
293           HERO effect. Though the Navy and Army have been aware, for some 33
294           years, of the hazard that electromagnetism poses to weapon systems,
295           the Pentagon has acknowledged very little about the hazards that
296           accidental explosions caused by various electromagnetic sources pose
297           to public and environmental safety.  The plaintiffs cite five specifi
298           HERO related accidents, including the 1967 explosion on board the USS
299           Forrestal which claimed 134 lives, along with a possible 25 other HER
300           related accidents that have occurred over the past 25 k;years.
301                Finally, in a continuing conflict related to the issue of
302           electromagnetic radiation and its effects on public safety and health
303           radar specialist veterans have been filing health claims, related to
304           their exposrue to low frequency radiation, against the Veterans
305           Administration.  All claims to date have been rejected.
306                With such a newsworthy issue as the effects of electromagnetic
307           radiation on public health and safety so clearly being played out
308           during 1987, the news media, for the most part, failed to tune in.

349      A "paramilitary wing" created by Reagan's campaign staff to prevent
350      such a possibility was largely unreported in 1987.
351           The revelations report that then campaign manager William J.
352      Casey headed an "October surprise" team engaging the services of both
353      retired and active military personnel.
354           During the course of the 1980 campaign, campaign leaders Richard
355      Allen, Edwin Meese, and Casey became concerned, almost to the point of
356      paranoia (according to journalists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover)
357      that Carter would get the hostages released thereby stealing away
358      Reagan's election momentum and assuring Carter of re-election.
359           Following is a brief overview of the reported activities of
360      Reagan's "October 1980 surprise" team:
361           Various reports reveal that Casey's "paramilitary wing"
362      monitored U.S. military movements for the Reagan campaign, met with
363      representatives of the Bani-Sadr government of Iran, and covertly
364      obtained President Carter's debate briefing materials prior to the
365      November election.
366           These revelations alone carry enormous constitutional
367      implications -- private citizens soliciting military and intelligence
368      assistance in monitoring U.S. government operations, private citizens
369      meeting with foreign dignitaries in possible state negotiations, and
370      private citizens clandestinely obtaining property of the United States
371      President -- and yet they were not followed up by the major media once
372      discovered and revealed in small, non-mass media publications.
373           Even more disturbing is the issue of Iranian arms shipments.
374      Documents confirm that within its first month, the Reagan
375      administration gave a green light to Israel to resume its arms
376      shipments to the Iranian government.
377           These revelations support former Iranian President Bani-Sadr's
378      assertion that the arms supply contract Iran signed with Israel in
379      March 1981, less than two months after Reagan's inauguration, was the
380      payoff for delaying the release of the American hostages until after
381      the November 4, 1980 election.
382           The hostages remained in captivity until January 20, 1981, the
383      day Reagan took the oath of office, and they left Teheran minutes
384      after he became president.
385           A conspiracy between a presidential candidate and a hostile
386      foreign power against an incumbent president would seem to be without
387      precedent in American history. At the very least, it would seem that
388      the documented charges revealed by a few journalists last year
389      deserved to be investigated for the benefit of the American public by
390      the U.S. media.

420 Well, I have NO problems with a women doing anything with her body she wishes.
421 I do howver have moral problems with allowing her to take the life of an 
422 unborn child. You don't get pregnant by sitting on dirty toilet seats.
423  
424 Now, I would also say that the man should be legally bound to the child as 
425 well. Put the Basterd in jail if he won't support his part of the 
426 responsibility.
427  
428 Don't mess around unless your prepared. If a man presures you and you don't
429 feel as if you want to, I (as a man) would say do what ever is neccasry to
430 discourage him. (Baseball bat, karate etc.)
431  
432 The only issue here is wether the unborn are humen. If they are then abortion
433 is murder. It's as simple as that.

442 There are cases where I agree, abortion should not be used as a birth 
443 control.  But you cannot even imagine carrying something around inside you 
444 for nine months, that is the product of a rape.  Rape is cause for serious
445 counseling in and of itself, having to deliver a baby as a result of it, you
446 cannot even comprehend, I can't I haven't gone through it.  No, abortion
447 has to be a choice open to a woman, she is the one who will live with the

469   I am a male who agrees with the viewpoint that abortion is "morally"
471 wrong.  But I do not believe there is enough evidence of when the human
472 fetus becomes a person to support all the mass hysteria that seems to
474 surround the subject (i.e. The Moral Right).  I choose now that my wife
475 not have an abortion even in the case of rape.  But I would not pretend
476 that nothing could possibly change my choice should I experience the rea-
477 lity of that situation, nor would I endeavor to pressure my wife to 
478 abide by my choice should she choose differently.  I suppose there is
479 some hypocrisy in that if the choice had to be made between the life of
480 an unborn baby and the life of my wife, I would not hesitate to choose
481 an abortion.  I believe this is not a question of morals that make or 
482 break civilization.  These are the morals that persons must decide for
483 themselves if they can live with their choice, and if they believe in a
484 God, can they consider their actions moral in the context of their reli-
485 gious beliefs.  Anyone else?

499 Who says BW is not a board for debate (or even tht it is a debatable boar
500 Debates have always been here. 
501 The problem with abortion is that it is such an emotional and thus religous
502 tied issue that it is essentially impossible for any consensous to be 
503 achieved. Myself, I recognise that there are many view points to life
504 and that my own view point is just that, my own. I do not try to demand that
505 the whole world should live the way I believe. On the same note I don't care
506 much for people who think they have a God given right to tell me what I
507 should or should not believe. 
508      Thus I don't feel that I or anyone else has any right to demand that 
509 a woman have or not have an abortion. that is a decision that only she can 
510 make based on her own beliefs. No one else has the right to presume that 
511 they can make a decision for her.
512    From a personal standpoint, if I had to make the decision, I would look
513 at it based on the situation. One thing to always remember is that the woman
514 can (with a few exceptions) concieve multiple times. Whereas her own life
515 is but once. In that regard I have absolutely no misgivings. The woman's
516 life is more important.
517      Then come the less certain areas, what about emotional stability and
518 quality of life? Should a woman be forced to bare a child that was unwanted
519 due to rape or other type circumstances? There are emense emotional wounds
520 that go with this. WOuld you forever destroy her life by demanding that she
521 carry full term something thatwill reminder her of this for the rest of
522 her life? I personally feel that no one has any right to demand that she
523 do something that will damage her either physically or emotionally.
524 And what of the child? think of the world of hatred and lonelyness that 
525 it would be forced into. It would be far better to wait for a time when the
526 mother is able to deal with it on a more emotionally stable position
527 (if at all). 
528    A persons sanity is as important as their life. What good is it to save
529 one life when you've destroyed another. The woman can conceive again when she
530 is physically and emotionally ready. Thus I lean in the direction that 
531 only the woman can make the decision.

533  
534 {}
535  
536    In my most Humble Opinion, I feel that abortion is an issue that should
537 be decided upon by the person it directly affects.  Who recieves the most
538 impact from an unwanted pregnancy?  The woman.  Who is the most vulnerable
539 in terms of economic, social, and physical standings?  The woman.  Who
540 does not directly come under the effects of the pregnancy?  The man.
541 Because our society is founded upon much of Old English values (don't
542 believe me?  Read your history again...), and those values carried a heavy
543 bias in favor of the male, the female involved will, by natural consequence
544 and logic, suffer.  It is not for men to decide the fate of women, for
545 the male body (and in the case of our society) and life(style) are
546 not directly implicated in a pregnancy.  Women should be given the
547 choice to allow or disallow abortions; I say this because we still
548 live in a male-dominated society.  I do NOT promote the feminist
549 movement; for that is a falacy; basically, fighting chauvanism with
550 chauvanism.  They have become just as bad as the people they fight
551 against; and their rhetoric is just as degrading as that of the
552 Male Chauvanist.  Because abortion is quickly becoming more of a
553 social issue, and society still has the male bias in it, I feel that
554 the issue comes to letting a (mature) woman decide if the pregnancy
555 is to be left or aborted.  Also, you can't say abortion is
556 'in toto' immoral.  Women FREQUENTLY and SPONTANEOUSLY abort
557 possible pregnancies, without their knowledge.  Spontaneous abortion
558 occurs about 25% to 50% of the time.  Otherwise, the pregnancy rate
559 in the 'United States' would be many many many many times higher.
560 The reason that this is a little-known fact comes from the sexual
561 values in 'America' today.  By scareing teens and young adults, and
562 through the careful use of partial information, the controling
563 portion of 'America' can hope to prevent teen pregnancies;
564   
565    Which brings us to another point;
566  
567    The root of abortion is found in the branch of American sexuality;
568 which, in turn, is found in Human Sexuality, which (finally) represents
569 the foundation of Human Life.  Want to eliminate abortions?  Increase
570 birth control.  I personally believe this because few belief systems
571 discourage birth control; and the ones that do, usually allow the
572 woman to prevent intercourse.  Any belief that does NOT allow a woman
573 to prevent intercouse invites rape.  And if that belief has values
574 against rape, well... don't through stones in glass houses (especially
575 AFTER you have move indoors) :)
576  
577    But I hope you 'see' my main thrust; that birth control presents
578 a viable answer to the abortion problem (for those who are against it
579 and for those who are for it).  Reguardless of the side you are on,
580 birth control represents an easy, understandable alternative.  If
581 your belief system does not promote birth control, then you don't
582 have to use it.  If you believe in birth control, then by all means,
583 use it.  If you're out in left feild (you can't make up your mind),
584 then simply abstain.  If you can't abstain, then you should re-evaluate
585 your beliefs - you have a MAJOR problem somewhere.
586  
587    But abortion will be (in my eyes), and always, a problem of
588 sexuality, and not a direct problem in itself.  Why do we try to
589 censor thoughts, deny birth control, and scare our young adults
590 when we should guide them, teach them, and let them understand the
591 meaning, consequences, and responsibilites of human sexuality.  Teen
592 pregnancy doesn't come from keeping knowledge like that from teenagers;
593 it comes from not fully understanding (note: I didn't say knowing) the
594 good and bad of human sexuality.  You might be suprised at the 
595 growing number of teenagers who can't comprehend the circumstances
596 of sex.  If they would have been taught from when they were
597 young up to the present, then they might be able to concieve of
598 the implications.  Instead, we:
599  
600    1) tell them 'the stork brings babies'.  A pile of bullsh*t.
601    2) tell them simply to 'not do it', without telling them what
602       to avoid in the first place.  This is misguidence (the
603       person recieving the message can not comprehend the
604       meaning of it; and they will simply go of to find out
605       for themselves)
606    3) harass them when they attempt to buy contraceptives, or
607       punish them if we find contraceptives in their room, etc...
608       This is equivilent to taking away a rabies shot from
609       someone who has been bit by an unknown dog.  If you're
610       lucky, you just might live...
611    4) make a feeble attempt to inform our young ones when their much
612       much much much too old.  Puberty truely marks sexual awakening,
613       but parents, teachers, etc. will hide information until many
614       many years later.  17-12 = 5 years without any truthful information.
615    5) expect (in some cases) for our children to discover sex and
616       desires on thier own.  Might as well feed them toxic waste
617       for a few years; then you decide to read the contents on the
618       box...
619  
620    I point my 'arguement' at teen-age sexuality because that teenagers
621 will be an adult in a few years.  And that adult will most likely become
622 a part of a society geared for and by, other adults that are older than
623 them.  The world belongs to our children, not us.  While they are not
624 immortal, they will be around loger than most of us.
625  
626    I did not mean to offend anyone, or to show disrespect.  This is
627 a private opinion that I have decided (much to my disagreement with
628 my
629 self) to share with you.  Enough of abortion debates!  A new disk
630 awaits us;  fill it with stories that you will, someday, tell
631 your children.

637 I would like to say that I fully agree with what Hagbard says in the area of
638 teenage sexuality and birth control. I wonder how many screwed up adults we
639 have running around now because they got bombarded with the "Sex is evil" 
640 type form of birth control.
641  
642 Sex is a neccasary bodily function. An enjoyable one no doubt, but in reallity
643 little differant from sleeping or eating.
644  
645 We cannot legislate morality. I do not support the Illegaliztion of abortion.
646 But I do feel it is my job to be as hounest as I can be when expressinf an 
647 opinion. The male dominance in this sociaty is definatly still prevalent, but
648 I do see many signs of improvment. Women are now showing up in growing 
649 numbers in fields were they have rarely been seen before. Given time I think
650 we will come to a fairly balanced role.

652 Sorry about continuing this Hagbard, but I felt I had to make a closing s

687 really has no0bearing on my life, and, being so, "Who Cares?" What I do
688 not like are people who are not involved in the issue trying to impose
689 their own morals upon other people whos situation has nothing to do
690 with them. This goes to both sides. Whatever you do is your own right
691 as long as it affects no-one else (or nothing else). Whether a fetus is

713 >Any woman who even *thinks* of having an  abortion should be shot!
714 It is my not so humble opinion that the above comment was made out of 
715 ignorance.  First, leds lok at the logic in volved.  I shall assume that th 
716 person 'John' considders the fetus is a living being.  Ofcourse every living 
717 being should be allowed to live, hence he is against abortion.  He is so 
718 against abortin, he would have thu wo}an shot who '*thinks* of having an 
719 abortion' shot.  Damn sound logic to me!  NOT ONLY WOULD THE WOMAN DIE, BUT SO
720 WOULD THE UNBORN CHILD!  Good God man, THINK!!!
721 Second, it sounds to me as tho' 'John' would have people conditioned to thin{ 
722 his way lest they be killed.  Sounds like a superiority complex to me.
723  
724 >Also remember that if it wasn't for us males you women wouldn't even be here.
725 Well, a statment like thit, even 'John' could see the redundancy in it!  It's0
72& so circular it's funny.  Yes, it would be dificult for women to be here, but it
727 wouldn't be to easy for us men to be here either!  Again, Mister, THINK!
728 Here at Network 0 we have a moto for people, for comments like these:

743    Once again I percieve why I prefer typing onto a disk a bunch of
744 words over other fun activities: Astral Dreamer is right; the majority
745 of pe`le on Backwater are of high caliber and broad knowledge.  Maybe
746 that's why everyone feels at home here - I know, I know, my ego is
747 inflateing along with everyone else, but I think this to be true.
748 Unfortuneately, my spelling is deterioratinw alng with it.
749  
750    * * *
751  
752    Kurfur seemingly was not interested in the free mead & ale, so
753 I sent him another stein, in hopes that he might take the bait again.
754  
755    Wonderer, excuse me for a moment;
756  
757    I0ope~ed the All-Seeing Eye.  A premutation (yes, PREMUTATION, ya
758 know, the mathematical meaning) came to me; it involved an earlier
759 idea; The Eye closed and I was returned to the Inn at the Crossroads...
760  
761    "Now!  Now is the time!"
7&2 0
763    The barkeep seemed a little upset with the idea.  A quick
764 telepathic metaphor calmed him.  He would be better off, with
765 what I had planned for his Inn.  I asked for the barkeep's
766 name. "Joe Tesseract Infinity", he replied.  "You can call me
767 JT for short."  Fine, I replied.
768  
769    "Wonderer, please isolate your being for a short while.  I'm
770 going to be doing some Inter-Dimensional work"
771  
772    The Eye opened again.  The Inn was surrounded, then sealed, in
7'3 a gravity bubble.  I felt the weight, the age, of the Inn.  Eternity
774 was slightly older than this place of rest and cheer.  Even after
775 enlightenment, I still held the thought in awe; but I had to push that
776 aside, for I could not hold it forever.  I opened a larger sphere in
777 my private Beta Space;  then, I place the gravity bubble inside the
778 sphere;  and finally, I re-synced the time flow, making the Beta
779 sphere shrink around the physical dimensions of the Inn.  And,
7800as qn added touch, a cyclitic wavelength generator was diffused
781 throughout the atmosphere of the Inn (read: a light source that
782 simulated day and night.)  This left some ecology adjustments
783 to allow for water, oxygen re-cycling, and an interface for
784 Beta Space (the gravity bubble would let light in and out, but
785 you couldn't pass through it).  A few trees here and there, a
786 lawn over most of the dusty road, and an arch acting as the
787 portal made the New Inn complete.
788  
789 0  The eye closed.
790  
791    Five seconds had passed.  My 'body' felt weak and non-material.
792 It seemed difficult, so I opted to float in the lotus possition
793 out of fatigue.
794  
795    "The arch outside will take you where you please.0 You simply
796 think of your destination, step through, and an arch on the other
797 side will appear with you stepping out.  To get into the Inn's
798 reality, you can either teleport, meditate, or think of the Inn
799 and walk through a normal, no~-mawical arch.  The size is such
800 as to allow for physical transportation devices, up to a
801 2895 Nova Tank (roughly the width of 3 1/2 school busses).  Any
802 being with a hostile intent for the inhabitents of the Inn will
803 simply be returnet to dhe point of origin; that is, they can'y
804 come through, and they'll just pop back into their own reality
805 right after the time they left.  But this has cost me
806 energy and thought;  I must rest, until the start of the new
807 disk.  By the~, I0should be well enough to make modifications
808 as needed.  Please, ask everyone for advice on the new location
809 of the Inn."

837 "Do I smell Mead?" I asked, as I entered the main bar room. "By the way, 
(38 there's a rather large temporal skew outside the door. Is this place under
839 construction or something?" And to the bartender, "Large Mead, and a box
840 of Smurf Mushroom Houses, preferably with the Smurfs pre-cooked inside, and
841 don't loo{ ad0me like that, thank you."

846  
847 Now, for a different viewpoint.  I'm female.  That probably puts me i
848 the minority on here, and gives me a semi-unique perspective.  For
849 unique perspective number tgo,0I've had an abortion.  One.  I wouldn't
850 do it again, but I don't regret what I did.
851  
852 If you've never been facing an unwanted pregnancy, you have no idea what
853 it is like to go to the doctor's office and have your worst fears 
854 sonfibmed.  Suddenly your future is in pieces.  But, but, but ... I have
855 to finish school.  I've got my whole career ahead of me.  How am I going
856 to be able to do all of this and give a baby a good life?  I don't
857 have any money.  I can't afford d have a baby.  I'll wind up another
858 welfare mother living in a slum.  That isn't fair to a child.
859  
860 I don't advocate abortion as a method of birth control.  But accidents
861 do happen.  That's how I became pregnant.  I also don't beliuve yn late
862 (> first trimester) abortions.  But had I not had that choice available
863 to me, I don't know what I would have done.  I certainly don't think I
864 could have raised an unwanted child in the manner he would deserve.
865  
866 When Y was at the clinic, I met women who were having their third or
867 fourth abortion.  That's ridiculous, and entirely uncalled for.  If
868 somebody can't figure out how not to get pregnant repeatedly, they're
869 too dumb to have reproductive organs.  8No flames, I don't REALLY mean
870 that.  They SHOULD be given a mandatory contraceptive-education class
871 after number two, if not number one.)  But I don't think that any
872 of the religious-wacko moral-majority types have the right to tell any
8'3 person that they can't have an early abortion.  It's none of their 
874 business.

877  
878    "Kurfur, welcome to Beta Space!"
879  
880    He seemed a lyttlu puzzled as to what Beta Space was.
881  
882    "Beta Space is akin to Hyper Space, but it is not a unique dimension.
883 Beta Space is my own private dimension that I created for myself.  Time
884 flows very slowly through Beta Space - which is0ghy0dhe temporal flow is
885 skewed around the Gravity Bubble.  As time meets this reality, it must be
886 adjusted for physical dimensions.  Otherwise, the stein you're drinking
887 would be the size of a car, but you would be the same size.  The
8880gravity bubble WARPS time, making time 'speed up' inside the bubble to
889 match physical surrounds from a different dimension.  The closer you
890 are to the bubble (from the outside), the more temporal skew you will
891 feel.  Which reminds me - I neet to0make a wormhole, so visitors will
892 not feel like they're on a bad airplane ride when they pass through the
893 gates.  The wormhole might distort your vision for a moment, but the
894 physical properties would only gradually change.  It's inhabitablu,
895 but yes, it is still under construction."
896  
897    "JT, could you check your cooler... I've made some modifications
898 to allow for a larger audience."  JT, tired, hurried, stressed,
899 angry, and bothered by the new regulars, smiled0for0dhe first time
900 since we all met at the Inn.  For once, these strange people had done
901 something wonderful for him; if, after climbing down from a 6 foot
902 stein, mopping the floor whenever the police arrived, and quiet,
903 floating men i~ robes had startled him, he had ever had enough,
904 then the relocation of the Inn was it.  But, he understood,
905 for a moment, how he played a major role in the afairs of the
906 multiverses;
907  
908    and then the thought passed from his mind+
9 9  
910       and he was unconcered, and upset, the same as before.  JT
911 went back to the cooler for two steins of mead; one for Kurfur,
912 and one I had just ordered on-the-spot.  Wonderer seemed to
913 be thristy, also, so I yelled for another meqd on my 'tab'.
914  
915    "Say, maybe we could do away with money - if we could figure out
916 how to make resources self-replenishing at the Inn.  This would
917 make the Inn a welcome place for newcomers, who have little money
918 and are tired vbom travel.  To borrow a phrase from a civil
919 revolutionary, 'I have a dream'.  The Inn would be a place of
920 good food and drink, with personalized rooms to accomodate its
921 regular patrons, and a place of safety.  Any ideas?  Opinions?
922 Comments?"
