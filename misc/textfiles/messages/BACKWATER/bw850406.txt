28 TO downloaders: More on the quirks of BW downloading...
29 Please note that the major cause of the loss of data at the beginning of each
30 line is because BW puts the line in a buffer while you are entering it.
31 When you send a carriage return, it tells BW to go put the line on the disk.
32 Now of course before it can do this, it first must find out 'where' on the 
33 disk to put it. It knows the sector to put it on, but it has to move the
34 head in the disk drive and wait for the sector to revolve under the head.
35 This takes about 200ms for the sector to show up, plus about 50ms for the
36 head to be loaded and stablized. For a sum total of 250ms, or 1/4 of a second.
37 This is fine if we are sitting on the proper track already, but if we have
38 to move, then we add in another 40ms for each track we move to. Normally on
39 a standard entry, we only have to move one track at worst since it is all
40 entered sequentially. thus a total worst case end of line delay of 290ms.
41 throw in an extra 10ms to round it up to 300ms, or 1/3 sec. However, sometimes
42 because of a disk error, for whatever reason, it may not find it on the first
43 revolution of the disk and we have to wait for it to come around again, thus
44 we add another 200ms to our total to be sure. Sum total = 500ms, or 1/2 sec
45 end of line delay. Ok, you ask that sounds good, but what this one and two
46 second delay stuff you been talking about? Well, I personally have this 
47 paranoid thing when it comes to hardware and software, when ever I find the
48 proper delay for something, I always double it "just to be sure". Thus I use
49 a one second delay at the end of each line 'just to be sure'. Ok, you ask,
50 that's fine, but what about the 2 second delay? Ah, glad you asked! Remember
51 what I said earlier about it taking 40ms to move from one track to another?
52 Well, what happens if the disk is full, and the head is sitting at the 
53 beginning of the disk? It has to step thru all 35 tracks to get to the end.
54 At 40ms per track, that's 1.4 seconds to get to the end. Thus what will happen
55 if you only use a one second delay, is that the first line will be put on the
56 disk fine, but it will still be busy writting it to disk while your sending the
57 second line. Thus the second line of the message (and only the second line)
58 will be missing some characters at the beginning. How to get around this?
59 Well, 1.) you could use a two second end of line delay, or 2.) You could do
60 like I do, and type BOTTOM 'before' typing ENTER. This puts the head at
61 the end of the drive ready to enter a message without having to move the head
62 so bloody far the first time. Thus allowing you to use the one second delay.
63 A further note, when you do a control C to get out of the enter mode, it moves
64 the head back to the beginning of the disk to save where the last used sector
65 was. An exception is if you fill the disk up, and it exits enter mode 
66 automatically, in which case there is no automatic update, and the head gets
67 left at the bottom. This is the reason for the OFF command still being here,
68 since if you don't type OFF before hanging up, the last sector information 
69 won't be updated, and thus all that nifty end of the disk stuff you wrote
70 will be gone to the four winds. So, when you type the OFF command, what it
71 does is to simply move the head to the first sector and write to disk the last 
72 known used sector. (as well as such things as current margin, protection, ect.)
73 Now that I've bored you all to death, ON WITH THE STORIES!
74 ******************************* CISTOP MIKEY ******************************
75 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (96:16)
76    Cistop Mikey:  Many thanks--you didn't bore me.  I've learned a lot from your
77 entries the past few days.  Is there any way this sort of information could be
78 made permanently available, so people who don't happen to log on when it's here
79 could send for it and thus not waste the system's time (and LINES) figuring out
80 how to upload?  I should think new users would be glad to send a little cash for
81 a few xeroxed pages of instructions.
82    It looks now as if I don't need any software fix if I type BOTTOM before I
83 ENTER (I already had a one-second delay).  But I don't quite understand why
84 reading the last few lines on DB to see how many were left for my test wasn't
85 the same as BOTTOM.  Was it because I fixed the margin--did it go back to the
86 first sector to save that at the time of the MA command?
87    All:  I still say even the simplest upload software should have
88 intercharacter delay capability (which is not at all hard to put in) because if
89 delays are needed only with cheap modems, that's all the more reason why
90 software for cheap machines--whose owners are most apt to HAVE cheap modems--
91 needs to compensate for modem deficiencies.  (Also, though BW can accept
92 characters at 300 baud from a good enough modem, many BBSs cannot.)  Why do I
93 feel this is worth saying here?  Because I never waste a chance to combat the
94 myth that "sophisticated" features are of use only to people with large
95 expensive systems, and/or are beyond the reach of those who can't spend a lot of
96 money for them.                      --SYLVIA, AKA "PROGRAMMER"

102 
   As the group of startled observers began to mumble confusedly among
103 
themselves,  Merlin  regained  his  composure and approached an amazed
104 
Arthur.
105 
  "It didn't do that before!" cried Arthur. 
106 
  "I'll explain that later," replied Merlin in a fatherly tone.   "The
107 
important  thing  is  that  it will probably draw quite a crowd, so be
108 
prepared to be mobbed."
109 
  The crowd did  indeed  gather,  and  soon  Arthur  and  Merlin  were
110 
engulfed  in people, nervously chattering as the tale of Arthur's deed
111 
was related again and again by the lucky observers.   Arthur  did  not
112 
release  the  sword  from  his grasp, but held it stiffly as though it
113 
would turn on him at any moment.  His mind was a  confused  jumble  of
114 
memories  and  jabbering  onlookers  with an occasional jar by someone
115 
patting him on the back.  As he  stood  there,  he  began  to  hear  a
116 
distant rumbling at the edge of the crowd.  The commotion increased as
117 
the  crowd  grew  silent  and parted !s though some large object would
118 
soon be rolling in.  Arthur recognized the form  of  his  king,  Uther
119 
Pendragon.
120 
  "A  child!" roared Uther, assuming a livid countenance, "What are we
121 
to do with HIM," he pointed an accusatory finger at  Arthur,  all  the
122 
while glaring at Merlin with wide red eyes. 
123   Merlin  had long  been Uther's  esteemed  advisor; a  curious figure
124 
that remained behind the throne and was the subject  of  much  gossip.
125 
Arthur  had  glimpsed  him from afar, but had never before encountered
126 
him in person.  Nor had he encountered the king, though  he  knew  his
127 
own  ancestry.   Uther  apparently did not recognize Arthur as his own
128 
illegitimate offspring, either.
129 
  "King Uther, may I present Arthur.  I, myself,  can  attest  to  the
130 
fact  that  he  has  pulled the sword from the stone this day, and can
131 
rightfully lay claim to the throne." Merlin's speech  was  perfunctory
132 
and precise, as though this was an ordinary audience before the king. 
133 
  Uther  reddened.   He  grabbed  Merlin's arm and spoke with his face
134 
close to this advisor's.  Arthur could hear his loud, angry  whispers.
135 
"You  said I would rule to the end of my days, you ..." and the tirade
136 
lasted for a long time.  The  nervous  crowds  had  to  be  repeatedly
137 
hushed  by  the King's Guard.  Arthur heard Merlin soothing Uther with
138 
talk of his ygung age and tutelage, which  irritated  Arthur  no  end.
139 
Far  too many had cast aspersions regarding his age this day.  He knew
140 
he was young, but not incapable.  As he escaped into  his  reverie,  a
141 
second  commotion  arose  from the crowd.  He looked up to see a large
142 
entourage  approach  to  confront  the  King.   They  seemed   totally
143 
disinterested  in  Arthur's  recent  achievement.  They were angry and
144 
well-armed; even the King's guard did  not  dare  to  challenge  them.
145 
they,  however,  had  other  ideas  and  spoke in decidedly unpeaceful
146 
tones.
147 
  "Pendragon, you have ravished for  the  last  time,"  the  tone  was
148 
menacing, "we of the far reaches have banded together to end your foul
149 
deeds  once  and for all," and with that, a mail glove was cast to the
150 
ground before Uther, who spat on it. 
151 
  "You dare to challenge the King of the Bretons!" Uther's wrath spoke
152 
for him.  He forgot Arthur totally as he bantered,  setting  time  and
153 
place for combat.  Arthur felt Merlin's hand on his shoulder. 
154 
  "Do  not  press  your claim now.  He must lead; this is his war, not
155 
yours."
156 
  "But you said we'd prevent a war!" Arthur countered, hoping to  make
157 
sense of the whole matter. 
158 
  "I  said we'd prevent your war.  Let this be your first lesson, boy,
159 
that Uther is a man, not  a  King.   His  honor  was  questionable  to
160 
himself, so he feels it necessary to defend it.  A man must be allowed
161 
to defend his honor, or he is less than a man.  But a King may not, he
162 
must be of unquestionable honor himself; an insult to him is an insult
163 
to the kingdom.  He must allow his subjects to defend his honor, since
164 
they  are  defending their kingdom.  Your honor will no longer be your
165 
own."
166 
  Arthur puzzled at this curious speech.  He felt sure  he  had  heard
167 
the  truth,  but  was  confused.  As all retired to the camp for a war
168 
council, he continued to ponder the message, all the  time,  clutching
169 
the sword that had changed his life.

Gee, it's neat to watch the border come out when downloading.  I don't
172 mind the technical jargon at all, as I know it will be used by those
173 who have need of it.  The other neat thing about today is that it's all

189 Grann was silent for many long moments until, at long last, he decided to
190 speak again.
191     "I wish to learn to defend my honor, and win my beloved."
192     Milchar thought about this, and said, "Tell me the rest- it will help you,
193 and allow me to decide your case."
194 Grann settled down for a long talk, then began:
195     "My home, Greyloam, is a small village that is entirely underground.
196 Many gnomes live there.  Many, that is, for gnomes.  We live almost hermit-
197 like existances, and several dozen families in a village is a gnome
198 metropolis.  Life there is pleasant."
199     "So far," Milchar said, "I haven't heard any reason to teach the Arts to
200 you."
201     "I am coming to that, if you'll just bear with me for the remainder of
202 the story.  Gnomes, while being hermit-like most of the time, are highly
203 competitive.  I myself have participated in thirty-eight Meets, as we call
204 our village contests.  Male gnomes ususally enter the competition to impress
205 females.  Meet scores carry great weight in courtship.  More than once have
206 the scores broken a tie between two suitors of a female."
207      "And still nothing.  Does your story have a point?"
208      "Impatience appears to be your forte.  For the past two years, I have
209 struggled to win the hand of Lyna, the daughter of the village leader.  There
210 is another, however, who also seeks as I do.  Frong would give much to see me
211 fail at the Meets."
212      "How often are your Meets?  And what do they have to do with magic?"
213      "They are...eight months apart, by the way you humans measure time.  The
214 reason the Meets are connected with magic has to do with another of your kind."
215      "Another mage?"
216      "Indeed, another mage.  He wandered near our village, and we gave him
217 shelter.  In return, he entertained us with glamours and petty tricks.  An
218 innocent enough event, except that it sparked the imaginations of the leader.
219 He had always remarked that there was no way for the quick-minded and feeble-
220 muscled gnomes to participate in the Meets, and that their planning helped
221 us as much as the labor did, but he had never found a way for them to join.
222 Until, of course, the mage taught some of the young his simple tricks.  Soon,
223 they were competing.  And now magic is a major part of the Meets.  Frong, even
224 now, studies magic from a mage from the east.  I do not wish to lose the next
225 Meet- surely my love must choose me after this next one!  But I need to learn
226 magic....from you."
227     Milchar was silent, then:
228     "Come along, Grann.  You've some studying to do."

231      The diminuative train wound its way torturously up the narrow ledge.  The
232 shear drop-off, so far that the white water below could not even be heard; a
233 thousand feet at least.  Above and bellow, dense green woods.  It climbed up
234 the impossible grade.  Automatics triggered by an obstruction ahead brought
235 the train to a calm and silent halt.
236 
237      A dull witted unigasi nibbled at the stray weeds growing between the nar-
238 row rails.  As stuborn as it was beautiful, it's silver-white fluff fur posit-
239 ively glowing, it refused to move.  Even as the raucus horn blared repeatedly
240 at programmed intervals.  Even as the winged and single horned beast grazed
241 oblivous to it's surroundings, a pair of kitterfiles, their wings like kalid-
242 oscopic jewels, attacked from both sides with tooth, claw, that distended
243 equiod neck.
244 
245      Only then did it react with random panic.  By then, it's life flowing from
246 torn arteries, it was too late.  It's death throws it clear of the track.
247 
248      Even as the kitterflies set their cat-like faces to the day's feast, the
249 train was already gliding forward, picking up speed with every inch.
250 
251      As the micro-rail's multiple unit coachs wound in and out the side
252 ravines, a gray ediface, capping a distant craig seemed to play hide and seek,
253 growing larger and closer every time it appeared.
254 
255      Castle Gray-Slime has a moat.  The micro-rail from Thubejubu crosses this
256 moat on bascule bridges which can be drawn up into the slime-stone walls.  It
257 also passes through what was once the great wall of Grey-Slime keep.  It is
258 here that the 3 car string of diminuative m.u. coaches glides to a scheduled
259 halt.

267         Not only did the cold bring frost to the branches, but it gripped and
268 stung the hands and face of this desparate man.  Attempting to maintain a
269 steady pace, he could no longer feel his feet as the numbness seeped in through
270 his boots.  One thought, one face kept reappearing in his mind; once again he
271 had a goal to reach for.  Stumbling in the direction of the town next to the
272 one closest his point of departure he came across a road that gave little sign
273 of having been used within the past several hours.  This was where he would
274 make the start of his long trek south.
275         As the signs of civilization unavoidably came into being, Kosta's
276 thoughts returned to those he had most recently met, and subsequently escaped
277 from.  First there was Gaudy Minsky; prehaps what it was that had caused him to
278 attempt such a bold measure against her comrades had something to do with her
279 beauty.  In a way she had reminded him of the one he was now on a mission to 
280 meet again.  What was it about her?  The face was strikingly simular, but the
281 eyes possessed a different quality, something he could not bring himself to
282 draw away from.  They were missing something, yet there was also something
283 more...  Was it understaning or confussion?
284         Next in line was Fellows.  At first glance he was a shallow man with a
285 quick turn of a phrase or draw of a gun.  Upon closer examination one might be
286 able to pick up the traces of a man that hid his complexity with his simply 
287 humorous, care-free style.
288         On the other hand there was this Farley person.  Had he not tryed to be
289 such an outstanding young member to the taem, he too might have been able to 
290 enjoy a care-free nature.  Behind his hesitaion there was a certainty, a power
291 that drove him towards excellance.  Someday he would play a major role in the
292 continuing existance of NET.  He was a good man that was still learning the
293 ropes of the REAL world.
294         And not to forget, there was still L'homme Parity.  What had happened
295 that had caused these two men, L'homme and Kosta, to have become so different
296 within their seperation?  Now a wiser man, L'homme had somehow changed in his
297 perspective and toleration of those that surrounded him -- accepting some while
298 having since turned on those that have left the fold.  Did he really have the
299 attitude of "sour grapes" to those that chose not to remain?  So much was to be
300 re-learned of this one time friend and partner.
301         The cold snapped Kosta back to the present as he once again stumbled 
302 with cold feet.  He blinked an focused his aching eyes on a road sing by the 
303 merging roads.  It said   HOOD RIVER / THE DALLES    NEXT RIGHT
304         "One step closer, one less obsticle to overcome.  A freind may be
305 visited here...  if the friend will permit."  Kosta strode on in confidence.
306 KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA

310   Intrigued by the invitation, the piper slid into a bench across from the
311 strange apparition.  The piper spoke.
312   "The future?  You can, then lsee what is in store for yourself and others?"
313 The dark cowl shook with the figure's assent.  The piper, while trying to retain
314 a modicum of politeness was unable to see the face hidden under the dark hood.
315   "Would you, perhaps, join me in a mug of the inn's best ale?" inquired the
316 piper, still hoping for a glance into the face of this strange companion.
317   "Yes," the hoarse whisper came.  "Yes, indeed.  Let us share a mug of the
318 inn's nut-brown ale, then peer together into what the future holds."
319   The piper's ruse was unsucessful -- he brought the ale, and while he was
320 seating himself, his strange acquaintance drank a quantity.  Conversation was
321 short, and a disturbance behind caused the piper to turn his head -- another
322 quantity gone from the mug.  Hearing his name called, the piper scanned the
323 room in vain, knowing as he did so that the final daught was gone and he was
324 no nearer to seeing the face across the table than when he first sat down.
325   "So, then."  The hoarse whisper claimed the piper's attention.
326 "We now look into the future to see what is in store for you, Piper-man."
327 Thin, pale hands emerged from the dark sleeves and arrainged a number of
328 objects on the table in front of the piper.  "Pass your hands over these tools
329 and we shall choose that which is most suited to you."

362                               Follow the Leader
363 
364     The throngs began nearly a quartermile from the entrance. Every description
365 imaginable stood in the makeshift lines, moving slowly, all with the same
366 destination. The lucky ones wore nametags. Did they forget who they were, only
367 to be reminded with the convience on the front of their shirts? Probably not,
368 but it was fun to think about. Thousands of people waited, some more patiently
369 than others. The occasional press against my back brought me back to reality.
370 It was always the same. No matter how crammed together people get, there are
371 always more to make the compaction more complete. Always more, it's never-
372 ending.
373 
374     The line began to move again. Someone called out from the behind me. "Is
375 this the line for ticket holders? Am I in the right line?" Replys came from
376 all directions. "Yea, you're in the right line. We're standing in line to
377 buy tickets." "Hey buddy, the ticket line is on the other side of the building.
378 You aren't supposed to be here unless you already have your ticket." "I'm just
379 waiting to get up front, so I can find out what the Hell is going on." Everyone
380 has a different answer. To each his own. Doesn't anyone know what's going on?
381 
382     This group mentality makes us all dump apes. No one thinks for himself.
383 We see a line, and immediatly go to the end of it. No one really knows what
384 the line leads to, or if it has any purpose at all. We're just born to stand
385 in line and wait.
386 
387                         They treat us all like monkeys.
388                         They make us stand in line.
389                         They give us a hundred dollars a week.
390                         And take back ninety-nine.
391 
392     "Would you like one today? Would you like one today?" A short man wearing
393 an earing stepped from person to person, offering a small pamphlet. Sometimes
394 the man moved to a new person with his offering. Other times the line moved
395 enough that the man's next client moved up to meet him. The reactions were as
396 varied as the individuals who gave them. Some ignored the man, looking away
397 so to block out the man's existance. Others reacted with sincere interest.
398 They took the man's literature, and some even continued to talk to the man
399 even when it was painfully obvious the man wished to move on and distribute,
400 not discuss. A few took the handout without a word, and deposited it on
401 the ground a few feet later, out of the passing man's view. It soon became
402 a chore to avoid the fallen pages, littered like so many leaves cast with
403 random on the ground.
404 
405     The man was finally far down the line around a curve and out of sight. The
406 line was moving faster now. People who shuffled before were now forced into
407 a more lively gait. The man in front of me, about fortyish, and balding,
408 the sun glistening off the sweat on top of his head, jerked the arm of the
409 little boy who had accompanied him in this line today. The child was slow,
410 and the father was rather rough in getting him going. That mentality again.
411 Move forward, more forward, at any cost. Don't care what it takes, just move
412 forward.
413 
414     The entrance was coming into sight now, and the line slowed down again.
415 People having trouble with their tickets. Angry shouts drift from ahead.
416 Someone is obviously disgusted with the slowness, and they aren't shy about
417 showing the world how they feel. Why does Man revert when standing in a line?
418 Is it something more than 'I Hate to Wait?' Is everyone a type-A person when
419 they stand in a long line? I don't have time to answer these earth-shattering
420 questions now. The line has started to move again, very fast now. I am almost
421 up to the front of the line.
422 
423     The little group around me would soon be broken up. We would go our
424 separate ways once inside. I would never see the rough man and the little
425 kid again. I would never see the coughing gentleman behind me, who cooled
426 my neck with his blasts of air because he failed to cover his mouth. I
427 would never see the pamplet man again. I took one of his handouts, and I
428 didn't throw it away, but that didn't matter. These people were strangers,
429 and they will remain strangers. The last couple hours in the heat, standing,
430 moving, and standing again means nothing.
431 
432     I am at the front now at last. The waiting is over. It is worth it though.
433 It's always worth it at the end of the line, when the waiting is over.
434 
435     "Sorry sir, wrong line."

462                               Fortunes of a Fool
463 Ivan the simpletion had never spoken with a frog before. But it did not seem str
464 ange to him that a fromg knew how to speak; Ivan believed that any animal would
465 talk, if given provocation. The way they sometimes looked at you, it seemed to I
466 van that they were just about to speak, only for somereason chose not to at the
467 last minute. He had shared this insight with his Uncle Vanya in the tavern on ni
468 ght, and Uncle Vaynya had agreed with him.
469 "Just so, Ivanushka," he said. "Why, only just this morning, I went into the bar
470 n to milk the cow, and I was in a hurry so I forgot to warm my hands before the
471 milking. The moment that I touched her teats, she turned a reproachful look upon
472 me a'Vanya, your hands are cold.' And I said, 'So they are, I'm sorry, I
473 forgot to warm them first.' At which the cow nodded understandingly and said, 'I
474 forgive you, Vanya, but see that you do not forget again.' And, just to remind m
475 e not to forget, she gave me less milk than she does usually."
476 And then the men in the tavern had laughed uproariously, and Ivan had laughed wi
477 th them, though he did not quite see why the story was to funny. But ever since
478 then, he had always made sure to warm his hands before helping Uncle Vanya with
479 the milking. And it seemed to him that the cows always looked at him with gratit
480 ude. Yet, they never spoke to him. But this did not surprise Ivan. After all, he
481 was a simpleton. Everybody said so, even Uncle Vanya. And if animals only speak
482 when its important, why should they speak to him? He was not important. Everybod
483 y said so. Whenever he wanted to discuss something with someone, they smiled at 
484 him and said, "Ivanushka, that's not important."
485 So Ivan had taken to discussing matters with himself. Not too far behind the lit
486 tle farm where he lived with Uncle Vanya and Aunt Sonya, there was a stream fed
487 by the snow that melted from the mountains. A large willow tree grew on the bank
488 of the little stream, and its roots were thick and protruded from the ground. Th
489 e way the roots protruded and the tree trunk angled away slightly from the strea
490 m, it made i nice place to sit, almost like a comforable chair, and Ivan would g
491 o there every day when his chores were done to nibble on some stale bread, toss
492 some pebbles in the water, and discuss things with himself. He always paid close
493 attention when he spoke, even if the things he said were not important.
494 During a pause in his conversation with himself, Ivan noticed at little frog sit
495 ting on a rock in the middle of the stream. The frog was watching him intently.
496 "Are you hungry?" asked Ivan
497 The little green frog seemed to nod.
498 "I can offer you some bread," Ivan said, breaking off a frog-sized piece and
499 tossing it carefully so that it landed on the large flat rock. "I'm sorry that
500 it's a little stale, but it's all I have."
501 The frog disn't seem to mind. It greedily gobbled up the little piece of bread,
502 and Ivan tossed it another .
503 "Now there's life," Ivan said. "Nothing to do but lie upon a rock all day and su
504 n yourself. You can take a swim anytime you want, you don't have chores to do,
505 and if you're hungry, all you need to do is lie very still and wait for a nice
506 big juicy fly to happen by. And at night you can sings to your heart's content
507 , and no one yells at you to be quiet. Oh, to be a frog!"
508 "You woundn't like it very much," the frog said quietly.
509 Ivan sat up. "What did you say?"
510 "I said, you woundn't like it very much, being a frog," the frog said, more
511 distinctly.
512 "Oh? Why not?"
513 "Being a frog is vastly overrated," said the frog with a sigh. "It's not as easy
514 you think. You always have to be on guard for a hungry fox or a ravenous raccoon
515 . If you lie down upon a rock to close your eyes and sun yourself, some sadistic
516 child tries to smash you with a stick. The water's very cold, and flies taste
517 awful. Try eating one and find ou for yourself. And as for the singing, all frog
518 s ever sing about is how tough life is when you're a frog. I just can't stand it
519 ."
520 "But you're a frog," Ivan said. "It's what your lot in life is. My lot in life i
521 s to get up at dawn and work 'til dusk, doing my chores."
522 "And to sleep in a warm bed-"
523 "I sleep on a straw mattress in the barn." Ivan said.
524 "Whatever. It's a vast improvement over a cold rock."
525 "That's true," Ivan admitted.
526 "And you get to eat warm, fresh baked bread-"
527 "Aunt Sonya sells the bread," said Ivan. "I only get the stale stuff that's left
528 over."
529 The frog shot out its long tongue and scored a direct hit on a passing fly.
530 "There you are," the frog said. "A nice big juicy fly. And it's freshly killed,
531 not stale. Which would you rather have, the fly or you stale bread?"
532 "I'll take the bread, I think," Ivan said.
533 "There, you see? Just as I expected. You're not quite ready to trade places with
534 me yet, whereas I would trade places with you in an instant. A warm straw mattre
535 ss and a loaf of stale bread - now there's the stuff of paradise!"

546      The slime-stone district is unusual even for this hexisphere of Lananara.
547 Micro-rails are almost never used for long distance/cross-country transport,
548 being mostly confined to high-population areas for automatic, schedule on demand
549 local transport.  For county wide nets, the more comodios meter gauge mini-rail
550 is more common.  The only common exception to this is in areas of environmental
551 fragility and animal migration patterns, here some sort of post and beam mono-
552 rail is the usual solution.
553      Destrict Slime-stone's population is too small and its resources too limit-
554 ed to support even this.  It is only because of the historical signifigance of
555 Castle Grey-slime and its promonent place in the thousand year old prophesys of
556 Lanujafa that it continues to exist at all.
557      Outside, in the sunlit baily, five scared and battered horizontaly elongate
558 crystaloid shaped single-ships nodded and bobbed on thair gravs.  Only invisable
559 teathers of electromagnetic force kept thair eight ton bulk from drifting majes-
560 ticaly away on the light breeze.
561      In a small 9-sided room, directly below the 'new' great hall, Debic seated
562 himself at his time-worn data station, one of nine, in the traditional circular
563 cluster.
564      This is another peculiarity of Grey-slime.  It is here and nowere else, on
565 all of Lananara, that a local house of deliberation meets and conducts both 
566 buissness and cerimony in what is essencialy the private residance of the Celo-
567 op-Soco gaurdian and his or her immediate family.  Though in practice, Castle
568 Grey-slime is a vertual mazriqual-adkar.
569      Even as the coordinators of Grey-slime, in a calm, and preyrful attitude,
570 conducted thair consultations, the great Jejkrekian battle-fleet massed to 
571 pounce on that 'helpless planet of pacifists'.
572      The first item on the agenda in befor Debic and the others was the need to
573 promote an increased production of ultrasonic powerbands on a massive scale and
574 distributing them, with approapriat training in thair use, to everyone interes-
575 ted  in becoming so trained and equiped.     This was quickly and unanimosly 
576 approved.
577      At the craftufacturing center in Thededela, Rera had set up a mini pro-
578 duction facility in her booath.  25 power bands would be completed before the
579 day was out.  Already 10 were finished and it was still morlning.  The remain-
580 ing 15 were in varios stages of assembly.
581      She had no idea what was so special about power bands all of a sudden but
582 the needs list on her persoinnal terminal this morning said something about a
583 bonus.  That was good enough for her.  Perhaps she'd be able to save up enough
584 for a vacation off planet.
