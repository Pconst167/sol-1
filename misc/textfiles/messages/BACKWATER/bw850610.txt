40      A lone figure sat watching, waiting for that which 
41 would not happen.   The time came and went,  and it did 
42 not  happen,  what dark thoughts pass through his mind?  
43 What desperate fears travel in his bones?   What  could 
44 have  happened?   What reason could cause this lack  of 
45 being?   Will the time be forever barren, or has he but 
46 allowed some dark demon to talk deep inside?  Where has 
47 the  time gone,  what has been done?   For the time has 
48 now  passed,  and nothing has happened.   Yet still  he 
49 waits,  watching,  hopeing, praying that his time sense 
50 is  wrong,  that the gods are only playing tricks  with 
51 his  mind.   Ignoring the demon's dark cries,  he  sits 
52 alone and watches, watches for that which did not come.

67     Fellows had slipped quickly to the side of the mansion's expanse of
68 property.  The wall continued around the house, high enough that he
69 couldn't see in, but it looked easily climbable.  Stepping between the
70 fragrant rose bushes that lined the wall, he jumped to the sill and pulled
71 himself over.  Jumping down from the wall landed him into a large
72 rhododendren, with more noise than he had expected.
73    The lawn surrounding the mansion looked well-kept, much like a golfing
74 green.  "Too bad I don't have my putter with me," thought Fellows.  Not
75 really knowing what to expect next, but having a feeling that it might be
76 messy, Fellows pulled out his pistol.  Just in time to see the warning LED
77 flash on, then off.  He waited.

81     No one was watching the car that they had stolen, so no one saw the
82 note get slipped under the left wiper.  The carrier of the message knew who
83 had stolen the car, and new that they would return to it.  The message
84 would be safe.
85     If anyone had cared to look at it, they wouldn't have seen much; only
86 five words on a slip of paper with a letterhead from a hunting and trapping
87 supply store in Medford, OR.  The words were, 
88                   "L'homme,
89                       please send help

95      Paul and his foreman returned from their extended lunch just in time
96 to see Ralph screw on the lid to the small hand-held remote control for
97 the latest revision to the car. 
98      "Here Paul, go ahead and try it! I did just what you told me to do
99 and I installed the remote switch behind the back seat. Go ahead, try it!"
100 As Paul took the remote control and turned to the foreman to explain the
101 latest phase of the operation, Ralph sprinted over to the car and seated
102 himself on the driver's side.         
103 "I'm ready when you are!" called Ralph from across the garage. Whirring
104 sounds of machines being turned on could be heard coming from the car.
105 After a minute or so, the sounds died down and all that could be heard 
106 was the car.
107      "I really must protest to this. Why do you find it necessary to 
108 constantly cut off my power just after you re-initialize my power-up?
109 Is that you out there Farley? I don't recognize you. Hello?" The voice
110 was that most widely reputed as "Fred".
111      "Okay, hit the switch the next time it starts to talk again."
112      "It?" asked Fred. "Now I *really* must..."
113 Just then Paul flicked the switch he had in his hand and the voice synth-
114 isizer hissed and crackeled from behind the rear seat. The voice turned
115 into a shocking falsetto. The foreman had a puzzled look on his face.     
116 "...protest. I will not be refered to as an 'it'. My name is Fred."
117      "That's more like 'Frida' now, toots," said Paul. The foreman
118 chuckled. "Okay, I'll switch it back for now. That should come in handy
119 once we have it, er, 'her' back on the raod." Now Paul chuckled.
120 As Paul returned the switch to the 'male' position, the trunk of the car
121 sprung open and a show of fireworks went off.
122      "Alright Ralph, what did you forget to do this time?" asked Paul.
123      "I didn't forget to do anything. I put the back panel back on just
124 like you asked me to."
125      "Did you finish re-installing those Ram chips like I asked you before
126 you put the back panel on?"
127      "Huh?" A major portion of Ralph's vocabulary.
128      "Never mind. Just get over here."
129      "Yeeea, right. Whatever you say."
130      "Those chips were a vital part of the reprogramming of the logic 
131 section. The whole plan would be ruined without them."
132      "The whole plan? No, wait! Listen! Don't you remember those guys said
133 they needed some extra parts for some other project..."
134      "Those chips won't work anywhere else other than in *this* car! Where
135 did the chips go?"
136 Ralph realized that they would never see those chips again, and all he
137 could say as he turned to look to the sky was...
138      "Oooops..."

142 a long time.  Lots of stories.  Fun, but watch out, summer's almost here,
143 and cometh the twits too.  But, I'll try and keep BWMS clean.
144 	On the practical side, Doesdoes anyone know how many modem
145 Users there are in the Metro area?  I have to do some research, and
146 I was wondering if the data had already been compiled.  Also, Brian Smith!

163      Several moments after leaving L'homme and Fellows, Farley had managed to
164   creep to the rear wall of the manor grounds.  Ivy fell in gigantic clumps
165   from the top of the wall; it had obviously not been well kept here.  Farley
166  drew the NET issue pistol and readied himself to check the small gate he
167 spied between two of the larger clumps of ivy.  The pistol felt strange in
168  his hand- he was used to his old one.  Ian had given him the utmost
169  assurance that the new guns had much more power and range than his old gun,
170   but Farley would have felt more comfortable with Betsy.
171      Farley peered around the corner.  No one in sight, but that was no
172 indication.  Farley spied a dog kennel at the rear of the house, the home of
173  the five vicious brutes that now lay before it.  To make matters worse, a
174  small red light on the gun abruptly lit- indication that gunplay was expected
175 soon.  Farley's grip tightened on the pistol, and he tried to think of a way
176 around the dogs that didn't involve noise.
177     Wishful thinking.  Farley's chronocom decided to act up again, this time
178  at a considerably louder volume than before:
179     "Farley: I regret to say that time is working against both of us.  We
180 need your cooperation.  Just a little information from you and then you can
181   have Fred back.  Wouldn't you like that?  A special transmitter will be sent
182  to you in the mail, disguised as an am/fm clock.  Tune it to 550 AM, then
183  press ALARM ON.  Further instructions later."
184      The dogs, before just lying about, were now quickly perking up their ears
185   and turning their head.  Farley jumped out of sight and punched the small
186   "Volume off" button.  Too late.  The dogs jumped up, eager to chase.
187      Suddenly Farley had an idea.  He quickly found a rock, then tested the
188 vines to see how strong they were.  Quickly, he climbed up the wall using
189   the vines, until he reached a point just below the top of the wall.  The
190  dogs were racing toward the gate quickly.  Farley waited for the right moment,
191 then completed a maneuver that did credit to the minimal NET traing Farley
192   had received.
193    Almost simultaneously, Farley threw the rock as far as he could away from
194   the house, and swung over the wall to hang from the vines on the other side.
195    The dogs had continued through the gate, following the noise the rock had
196  made.  In a time shorter than it takes to tell the story, Farley closed the
197   gate and locked the dogs outside, with himself conveniently inside.
198    Farley smiled faintly at the bewildered dogs.  Now out of immediate
199  danger, his mind drifted a moment on the message.  Could they have him?
200     He decided not to worry about it now, in the middle of an assignment. 
201  Farley carefully made his way to a rear door, and quietly pushed it open.
202    "Now to find out what's going on..."

213 names, oh those creative names are going to be here too! I almost forgot!
214 Names like 'METAL HEAD' and 'HEAD BANGER', not to mention the stories they

264       I sharpen my pencil in preparation like any prudent warrior before
265 a battle.  The clean white paper is neatly arranged in an inviting stack,
266 ready to become the ultimate in literary work.  As my pencil approaches
267 the paper, the expected happens.  All the half formed ideas and fragments
268 that had, until now, been crowding around watching the preparations take
269 this opportunity to flee like nebulous mice.  They vanish into hidden
270 corners, leaving my mind as blank as an unfurnished apartment.
271       I consider leaving the desk for oblivion in a cup of coffee, but
272 with an effort of will I remain seated.  After all, this is not new.  It 
273 happens nearly every time it's necessary to write.  I decide to try a 
274 technique used by our cats.  By elaborately ignoring one's prey, it can
275 often be persuaded to get within striking distance.  I begin to think 
276 about last summer, people I knew fifteen years ago, and the archaeological
277 disaster of my closet.  It seems the trick is working.  A mouse-idea 
278 whisks out of hiding, intrigued by my apparent lack of interest.  I will 
279 wait until it comes close enough, then I strike, catching its tail with
280 my sharp pencil, pulling it out into letters, words, sentences.  The 
281 pencil races over the paper, trapping the idea in my illegible hand-
282 writing.  Heedless of the scrawling, I write on, for sudden inspiration
283 cannot be made to wait for something as insignificant as penmanship.

301   Wracked by the agonies of grief, the piper slept the day through.
302 Curled beneath the boughs of a small evergreen on the edge of a clearing
303 in the deep woods, he did not notice his visitors -- the wolves who had
304 brought him there sniffed once or twice then moved on about their business.
305 His sleep was troubled.  Often his body would shudder and jerk, inarticulate
306 sounds would force themselves from his throat before slumber would again deepen.
307   The last light of the evening was still staining the evening sky when the
308 piper finally regained partial conciousness.  Shivering, he tried reflexively
309 to gather the rags that remained of his clothing around himself.  
310   We don't really know all the connections between our state of mind and health.
311 Some have estimated that 20% of all disease has a mental origin, others maintain
312 that the figure should be closer to 90%.  This does NOT mean that between 20
313 and 90 percent of all disease is imaginary; it means that the root cause, the
314 prime factor of these diseases is the human mind.  Not only do we not know how
315 many diseases are caused by the mind, we don't really know how to treat them 
316 or just how the mind causes the problem.  What we do have are a few examples
317 of physical symptoms caused by mental stimuli.
318   Most are well known, raising a blister on a hypnotized person's arm by
319 telling them you are touching their arm with a red-hot iron, then pressing
320 a finger to the flesh, hysterical blindness, and ulcers.  Others, not widely
321 talked about, include cancer patients who have been able force the disease
322 into "spontaneous remission" by visualizing their body successfully battling
323 the invader.  Indeed, some studies show an amazingly high correlation between
324 personality traits and the onset of the disease itself.
325   Shivering beneath the sheltering boughs the piper sought refuge for his
326 wounded mind and body.  The sick sleep he fell back into was marked by
327 shivering and twisting as his body rebelled under the lash of his mind.  Had
328 anyone been near, his flushed face and rapid shallow breathing would have
329 alerted them that something was wrong, but only a passing owl drifing across
330 the branch-engraved moon saw the motion beneath the boughs.

334    The readability index tells you the level of education a reader will
335 need to understand the document. If the Readability Index is 12.4, a
336 person would need a high school education to understand the document.
337 
338    The following values were obtained using the Flesch-Kincaid formula
339 to calculate the Readability Index. This formula is the United States
340 Government Department of Defense standard (DOD MIL-M-38784B). The
341 government requires its use by contractors producing user's manuals
342 for the armed services. The Readability Index is equivalent to the 
343 Overall Reading Grade Level (OGL) for the document. The Index is based
344 on the average sentence length and the average number of syllables
345 per word.

373       So, in five months and six days the number of users has gone down as
374 well as the average of the index.  That should only be expected seeing as
375 there was a change in the index being used.  Curiouser and curiouser.
376       It is somewhat disparaging not to find the multitude of users that
377 there once were, but since this thing called summer shall soon be upon us
378 I don't doubt that the increase should take only a short time.  Maybe.
379 
380       To some more time is now available while to others there is less.

390 INDEX: Curious. Although I can see how it is only valid with certain
391 considerations. Unfortunately, not all the previous entries could be
392 scaled too. That would be interesting. Any possibilities? And, how
393 would that rate. I used large syllable words but all of them are common
394 enough and easily understood.
395 .....................................
396 I'd love to see how that program figures syllables....
397 For instance, does it know that 'through' is only one syllable?

400 	Observations #31
401   Hey, there's a hole in my sock.  When did that get there?
402   Those things are really amazing.  Have you ever wondered where the holes
403 come from?  I go out, buy a brand new pair of socks, and come home to wear
404 them  The next thing I know, a hole has appeared!  It wasn't there when I 
405 bought them, and I never saw or felt it creep up on me.
406   I think it's a communist plot.
407   I'm willing to bet that the soviets are smuggling the little devils into
408 the country in huge crates marked "wholesome additives".  Once in the
409 country, the holes are turned loose on the poor innocent socks, as a way of
410 breeding dissent in the people.  The Soviets probably think that if the hole
411 situation gets bad enough, the people will demand that the government take 
412 over all of the sock manufacturing, in hopes of improving product quality.
413 Thus the beginnings of social change and governmental aquisition of private
414 industry.
415   The fact that the Soviets are overlooking is that we know better.  The
416 American people know that if the government took over sock manufacturing,
417 the socks would soon end up with built-in holes, also known as 
418 "loop-holes".  Only the rich would have the resources to afford the
419 specially trained personel to eradicate the holes, while the poor would have
420 to live with the governmental surplus socks distributed on cheese and sock
421 day.  Capitalism would continue as strong as ever.
422   I have just recently discovered a way to keep the Soviet holes from taking
423 over all of my socks.  When I buy a new pair of socks, I carefully cut a 
424 small hole in each heel and sew a small hem to keep it from fraying and
425 spreading.  This way, when a hole tries to jump into my sock, it finds the
426 sock already inhabited by a hole.  You see, holes are very territorial.
427 Seldom will you find more than one hole in the same sock.  When it does 
428 happen that one hole tries to intrude upon another's sock, it will get 
429 eaten, and the original hole will grow that much more.  Since my holes
430 aren't truly alive, this can't happen.
431   I once heard of a certain hole that was very aggressive.  It would sit in 
432 a sock eating all intruders, until it had grown so big that the sock was
433 useless and had to be thrown out.  It migrated from sock to sock, growing 
434 larger and larger, until soon the sock would completely disappear as it
435 climbed in.  I suspect that this is what happens to all the socks that get
436 lost in the world's laundries: that hole, and others like it, is hiding in
437 the dryer, eating socks whole.
438 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Emu
439 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$observations...(^cont?^)
440   That hole that you saw appearing on your socks is probably much like the
441 one growing in your head this very instant.  One that just eats up all the grey
442 stuff you never wanted to use, a void that is growing and GROWING!   Soon you
443 will be all gone, to bad, so sad. There will be nothing left of you except
444 a big hollow shell that little kids will play house in.
445   These holes are not only on our socks, they are in our minds. If we don't
446 get on the bal;l and get the little guys out it's going to be pretty messing.
447 So get up, go outside, and tell a friend or two!  WARN THEM BEFORE IT HITS!!!
448 They will be ever so gratefull...
449 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$observations.  not to be taken seriously.

487   Sigh.  I guess my addiction to complex sentence structure (I really don't
488 get too unreadable do I? (If I do please forgive me; it is one of my few
489 small pleasures (or indulgences) in life)) gets me into the "writer for the
490 more educated" catagory -- for which, this sentence should be a real test;
491 those who can decipher meaning from it probably are reading at a level 
492 comparable to those undertaking post-doctoral research.
493   I really wonder how that last sentence would affect my reading level index?
494 That one's a mess -- subordinate clauses dripping off at every turn and twist;
495 wordy; and really useless.  Does anyone know whether the various reading 
496 indices take sentence structure into account, or do they just count 
497 word-length/syllables and sentence length?  Oh, well, try to get back to the
498 story soon.

509 She rode through fire, but was not seared.
510 She rode through water, but did not drown.
511 She rode through earth, but was not enveloped.
512 She came to air, and breathed fear.
513 "Why have we stopped?" asked the mount?
514 "I feel pain," came the reply.
515 "When I rode through fire, my strength of will cloaked me.
516 "when I rode through water, my loyalty bouyed me.
517 "When I rode through earth, my honesty freed me.
518 "What have I now?
519 "Walk with me," said the horse.
520 She took a step, and breathed fire.
521 The horse grew dark.
522 Again she stepped, and began to drown.
523 The hore grew smaller.
524 Another step, she choked on dust.
525 She felt a hand clasp her own.
526 She kissed the equine man, they breathed as one.
527 He said, "You were the horse.
528 "You carried me, you protected me.
529 "And I led the way."
530 She faced him now, and knew the warmth of the fire,
531 the coolness of water
532 the support of the earth, 
533 And the sweetness of a breath drawn that was not hers alone.

565 Hmmm, Attention: Spelling checkers are fine, but if anyone figures out a way
566 to write an intent checker and a sentence structure checker, they've got a
567 good market right here.  I think I'll chalk this one up to fatigue, or perhaps
568 temporary insanity.  What I REALLY need is a brain that works more than 10-15%
