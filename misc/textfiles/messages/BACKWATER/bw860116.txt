30                              Ted Takes a Trip
31                                  Part 3
32  
33                "Another  jumper? Third  time  this  month." A man wearing a
34           hard  hat  had  spoken. Funny,  Ted  didn't   recall  seeing  any
35           construction work  going  on in  the area when the air porter had
36           circled until the unloading zone in front of  the Pickwick opened
37           up.
38                "Huh? Oh  I  don't  think  so." Ted didn't really know quite
39           what to say.
40                "The Pickwick's got a reputation." said another lady, older,
41           wearing a print dress and a big floppy sun hat.
42                "I  didn't  know." Ted  responded,  but  the  people who had
43           joined him had already started walking off.
44                "Didn't know what my man?" Ted whirled  at the  sound of the
45           voice behind  him, startled. "Didn't  know I was behind you?" But
46           before Ted could utter a word, the man, a Negro dressed in shabby
47           clothes with a multicolored multi-patched vest on spoke again. "I
48           would just like to know my  man, if  you could  spare some change
49           for a poor guy like myself."
50                Ted  hesitated,  he  had  never  been panhandled before. The
51           beggar  continued. "It's  not  like  I'm  askin'  for  a  million
52           dollars. Just a little bit of change for a poor guy like myself."
53                Ted dug  his hand  into his  change pocket, and produced two
54           shiny quarters. The beggar's eyes lit when he saw the change, and
55           he  held  out  his  hand. Ted  gave  him the quarters. "Thank you
56           kindly sir. You have a  true heart  to help  out a  poor guy like
57           myself. Thank  you  kindly." The  man  trudged  off,  holding the
58           quarters tightly in his hand.
59                Ted realized that he hadn't even got a  word in edgewise. He
60           shrugged, and  lugging his carry-all bag behind him, made his way
61           to the ornate entrance of the Pickwick hotel.

101       The Sage found himself ooking out of the open window.  The page and
102 the quill were soon still.  Only the clouds moved, behind the wooden window
103 sill.  His eyes darted around the scene and found themselves focussing
104 easily on the aspects of it.
105       Sitting on the page before him was a shambles of misspellings and
106 errors, enough to bring his eyes down from the scene in shame.
107       Why is it so difficult, it is not my fault, murmured the Sage to the
108 page as if it was the essence of his errors and obligations.  Why do my
109 letters always engage so many people, put them to task, embitter them?
110       The page soaked the ink from the quill and soon there was no ink left
111 to finish the letters, and the obligations the Sage had beset himself with.

117 Splitting oak
118 
119 Use a splitting maul for the gnarled chunks, 
120 a sledge swung in an arc that closes
121 iron on iron, and an aim like vengeance.
122 Think about anything as you swing the hammer,
123 slamming the maul through the heart, 
124 and you'll find its mean-streak to hit, what
125 can't be forgiven will rise its red light on
126 your every thought.  The pounding wants
127 its friend Intent, a reason to pound.
128 
129 You have gone your own way
130 to bring these two together, though
131 you only thought a quiet heat, the calm
132 pleasure of a night by the fire, a glow
133 on her thigh you'd shadow with your own.
134 But it doesn't matter what you thought or
135 how you got there.  Just stand back, swing with all
136 you've got while they break the bonds of what held
137 its ground, and you will walk through doors with 
138 fire in your arms, all but the spark
139 before oak settles into ash, like a man
140 into memory, a man who can't forget
141 the wedge of doubt he drove home, 
142 a man who brought his work inside.
143 
144 Look at what is left, the half that
145 did not fall from the block
146 standing with its white heart exposed.
147 It had seized around a limb
148 and held itself whole so tight you
149 drip sweat and gasp in the chill air.

161   I fear that I unintentionally
162 made an enemy on the last disk.
163 That was not my intention. I
164 REALLY like this BBS, it has
165 been and always will be my 
166 favorite. It was TRULY good
167 to see it still running at
168 300 baud. AND to see that
169 everything was the same as
170 it was. My heartfelt thanks
171 are extended to the Inn 
172 Keeper and the patrons for
173 being what they are... Again
174 I say, no insult was intended
175 and I hope to see more of the
176 BMWS in the future.. I have
177 so little time to slow down
178 these days. Guess thats why

195 We guys are not all like that. Some of us don't "sweet talk" at all. If you 'like' someone just because of what they
196 have to say, then perhaps you aren't looking deep eough. Say, you're kinda cute. Want to come over and see my selected 
197 shorts? How 'bout my etchings?  Did I ever tell you that you remind m of my sister? I really do respect you.
198 I just hope you understand that what 22 credit hours and a part time job, I don't have time for a serious relationship..

200 The engines slowly whined down, the roar fading to a low howl which blended with the whistle of the wind.
201 The runway was deserted at this early hour and a light rain had started.The purple of the ground lights
202 reflected from puddles on the asphalt, shimmering as the drops fell, and lending an eerieness to the scene.
203    The pilot walked unhurriedly across the apron toward the FBO, wondering if there might be a mechanic about.
204 The wind picked up as he neared the door. Inside he coul see a man sitting at a workbench tinkering with an altimiter.
205 Hearing the knock, he motioned the pilot in without turning around. "Be right with you"
206 He stood up, and ambled across the room to the frij and cam back with tw cans of Budweiser. He handed one to the pilot.
207 "Heard you radio for clearance. 24B, huh? Very nice. Yours?"
208 The pilot set his briefcase on the floor and cracked open the can. "No. Rented. Thanks for the brew"
209 He continued,"Think you might have a look at the port door, lock's busted. Shuts OK, but wont lock"
210 "Kind of warm for this far north, ain't it?"
211 The mechanic looked at him. "Hell, we call this a heat wave. Lets go have a look...."
212    His words were drowned out by the roar of the twin Pratt and Whitney engines revved to 100 percent power.
213 "What the..., the pilot swore as he raced for the door. The mechanic was right behind him. "The jeep...."
214 They piled in, and turned toward the runway; the mechanic punched the accelerator and the vehicle leapt forward
215 tryng to get ahead of the now taxiing Lear. The comm in the jeep crackled into life.
216 "ONE FIVE LIMA JAPAN ABORT IMMEDIATELY LOCKHEED ON FINAL APPROACH..."
217 Delta Five looked up to see the approaching aircraft about a half mile out. The jeep had reached the 
218 center of the runway, and the driver stabbed the brakes, and whipped the jeep into a skidding right turn.
219 They were rushing toward the oncoming Lear when the landing lights stabbed through the darkness, blinding the two men
220 Time was stretched to it's outermost limits, and everything seemed to happen in slow motion.
221 The jeep skidded sideways along the runway just as the LearJet rotated.
222 As the jet lifted off, the undercarriage ripped the canvas top from the spinning jeep, and it slid onto the grass.
223    The Lockheed screamed over them, and landed in the wake of the departing Lear; the pilot fighting for control.
224 He finally brought the Tri-Star to a halt a few feet from the end of the slippery runway.
225 Two figures emerged from the cabin, and started to walk towards the jeep.....
226    Delta five sat there, in the passenger seat, his head in his hands. Someone had stolen a Lear Jet.
227 An aircraft with less than one hours fuel and, in the cargo hold
228 a Plutonium bomb that COULD detonate if the aircraft were to crash. It had to be McKane......

237   The piper sat silently before the fire, nearly dozing as the flames warmed
238 his cold body.  The taste of the ale hinted at the summer sun that had grown
239 the barley, the summer winds that had rustled the myriad grain stalks in the
240 long days before harvest.  Here, concentrated, was the efforts of man --
241 the husbanding of the soil, the care and concentration of the brewer, and
242 something more -- here was that subtle magic that had brought together
243 strangers and forged a bond of fellowship that had transcended realities and
244 reached far across the multiverse.
245   The piper drank deep and looked around the empty common room, wondering
246 where the inn's patrons were.  When would that thick oaken door open to
247 admit a breath of the cooling evening air with one of the absent patrons?
248   The logs on the fire shifted, the support for one having been burned away.
249 A shower of sparks drifted up the chimney, sending a flickering beacon to
250 any who might be bending their steps down the Innisfal trail, lighting
251 the steps over the wooden bridge that spanned the chuckling stream that
252 passed close by the inn.

257         "Now take a careful look at this Fellows. I don't think the code here
258 is so tough, but the message is very clever."
259         "What do you mean 'clever' Parity? It is not like any NET code I have
260 ever seen before."
261         "That is precisely it. This is not standard NET code. Someone has
262 managed to send us a message over the comm-link, unencrypted, but with the
263 proper comm-link unlocking sequence. Your ten-code worked, didn't it?"
264         "Yes, but... OK, you tell me, what exactly does this stuff mean!"
265         "Let's take a look, one group at a time. The first group says 
266 'EIGHTHBIT', what do you think that means?"
267         "OK, I see what you are saying. That one is easy. 'EIGHTHBIT'equals
268 Parity, the message is for you."
269         "Right, see how easy it is! Now the second group. 'HASSADICAWARE' I see
270 the word 'aware' at the end, leaving 'HASSADIC.' How about 'HAS SAD IC?'
271         "No way, SAD disbanded due to lack of interest. Sometimes I think these
272 spy organizations that crop up overnight are just attempts by people who don't
273 have anything better to do to stir up a little excitement."
274         "OK, so it doesn't have anything to do with an IC. What then... How
275 about 'HASSADIC?' Isn't that another term for Jewish religious influence?"
276         "I guess, but 'Jewish aware?' That doesn't make any sense, Parity."
277         "Aha, now I get it. 'Jewish aware' 'Jew aware' What's another word
278 for aware? 'Jew know' Juneau, as in Alaska!"
279         "OK, very clever. Let me try the next one. 'TRIXASAHRS' Tri-X film is
280 ASA 400. It must mean 0400 hours.'
281         "Fellows, I think you have the hang of it. The next group is
282 easy. 'LOOKFORBODYBLACKFE2' Look for someone carrying a black Nikon FE2
283 body. And now the last?"
284         "That one worries me Parity. 'DELPHI' All I can think of is Delta V.
285 Do you think it could be from him?"
286         "Anything is possible. This may be his attempt at getting together 
287 with us. Whatever the case, I think we better head for Juneau. We can charter
288 a plane to White Horse in the Yukon, and take a lake-hopper from there to
289 Juneau. If we leave soon, we can make it there before midnight."
290         "Are you sure we can find a charter this time in the afternoon?"
291         "I bet between us we can convince someone to rent us their plane. The
292 color of our money is green, and we can be pretty convincing, right?"
293         "Right you are Parity, so it's off to Juneau. Yipee-i-ya!"
294         "What did you say?"
295         "Never mind Parity, you probably wouldn't understand."

307 Piper shivered as the thick oaken door opened to admit a breath of the cooling
308 evening air. He glanced up to notice a stranger- a man with a grey cap and dirty green overalls.
309 The man glanced around the room, nodded to Piper, and walked toward the bar where the innkeeper sat, head on the
310 counter, oblivious to all reality. The man ran his finger beneath his nose and slapped a crinkled piece of paper on top
311 of the Innkeeper's nose.
312 Glanced around again, he shrugged his shoulders and walked toward the door, leaving the room with nary a glance.
313 
314 Soon Piper heard a pounding on the door from the outside. His curiousity raised, he rushed to the door and yanked it
315 open. The man in the dirty overalls was already walking down the lane, scratching his rear end as he did so. A poorly
316 whistled rendition of "Annie With The Two Dollar Gun" floated back on the breeze.
317 Piper glanced at the outside of the door, noticing a piece of paper which had been nailed to it.
318 Moving his nose up close to it (his eyesight wasn't what it used to be), he read the form letter:
319                                                      NOTICE OF EVICTION

339 	"I can't tell the constable about the other girls, because he'll
340 recognize me," Miranda thought to herself, "but I've got to get his
341 attention somehow."  Getting away from the slavers had tired her, but
342 she felt much more confident of her powers outside than in her private,
343 closed room.  As illusion was the easiest, and she was hungry and tired,
344 she decided that it again would be her choice of spells.  Soon, Miranda
345 heard shouts from around her as people began noticing the pre-dawn sky
346 lit by a huge flame floating above a certain run-down section of the
347 city.  Using it as a distraction, she was able to slip into the nearby
348 market and grab some bread and vegetables to soothe her hunger.

350 	Walking towards the city gate, Miranda watched the city come to
351 life for another day.  "It is so much busier than an island!" she
352 reflected.  Many times on their island, Miranda and Prospero got up
353 early to watch the sun rise up from the ocean, exactly opposite from
354 where it sank the night before.  Once, a very young Miranda asked her
355 father, "Can the sun swim, Daddy?", and amid the multitude of morning
356 birds greeting the day, he told her that most people thought that "the
357 sun goes clear around the world and never gets wet at all."  Now in the
358 city, with the houses and buildings all around, no one could see the sun
359 until it was already partway up the long journey to noon.  Even before
360 the sun was fully visible, the marketplace would be in full swing, with
361 its cacophony of sight and sound: sellers calling out their prices,
362 buyers with baskets of goods for their households, coins sparkling as
363 they changed hands; farmers, fish mongers, craftsmen, money changers and
364 money lenders.  The smells of fresh breads, fruits, and vegetables
365 mingled with those of people and animals to help create the feeling that
366 this was the center of commerce: this is where everything happens.  And
367 Miranda knew that the only way to get herself out of the city without
368 being recognized was to loose herself in the crowd.
369 	The initial shock of going from a large deserted island to
370 living in a city full of people wore off after she had been in Milan a
371 couple years.  Miranda still felt claustrophobic in crowds, but could
372 contain her fears now so that they no longer distracted her.  With food
373 in her belly, she was able to think clearer.  A small surveillance
374 bubble now surrounded her to keep from repeating the previous night's
375 events.  She was aware of all who came within three feet of her, though
376 she soon had to shrink the sphere as she couldn't keep track of the more
377 and more people that crowded into the marketplace and passed next to
378 her.  She kept in the stream moving towards the main gate and slowly
379 made her way through the throng.
380 	At the gate, the guards were busy trying to remove a small band
381 of gypsies from the city.  The gypsies were travelling in a light blue
382 wagon, covered by a large multicolored tent.  On the wagon hung cooking
383 utensiles and farming equipment, and miscellaneous symbols decorated the
384 sideboards.  It was drawn by a huge ox and driven by a boy of about ten. 
385 His mother was sitting next to him, watching her husband arguing with
386 the guards.  Trailing behind the wagon was an old horse, tethered to a
387 ring on the back, carrying the most ancient looking woman Miranda had
388 ever seen.  This woman seemed oblivious to the commotion beside here,
389 sitting deadly still, yet with a troubled frown.
390 	In the commotion of the argument, Miranda slipped passed the
391 wagon and through the gate.  She thought that no one had seen her, until
392 she looked back at the gypsies; the old woman had come to life and was
393 staring directly at Miranda.  Unblinking, she barked a quick word to
394 the man below her, and he immediately stopped arguing.  To the guards'
395 delight, he got onto the wagon without another word, and directed his
396 son to drive out.  The wagon lurched into movement.
397 	Under the old woman's stare, Miranda found that she couldn't
398 move a muscle.  She watched as the wagon drew aside, and heard the old
399 hag belt out another order.  The wagon stopped with the hag sitting on
400 the horse, high above Miranda, still holding her stare.  An old,
401 grinding voice came from her throat with a statement, not a question:
402 "You have magic."
403 	Miranda could only nod.
404 	"Get in the wagon."
405 	Miranda found that she had no choice.

576 Morrissey, That was my way of addressing L'homme sans Parity, by his last name, Parity, his first name being, of course 
577 L'homme. sans is French for 'without'. When I "coded" my message, I knew he would know it was to him because he'd 
578 know that the "eightH" bit is the 'parity' bit, his last name. What parity means is,- well, a character-letter, number
579 etc, in ASCII is one byte, and a byte is eight binary bits. However, letters, numbers, etc, use only seven of these
580 8 bits, leaving one unused, the EIGHTH BIT. This eighth bit can be used as a method of error detection in ASCII data
581 transmissions, by counting the number of ones or zeros in each byte, and comparing this total with the parity bit.
582 ASCII is an acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, and is a system whereby each letter or 
583 number has a set pattern of ones and zeros. For example the ASCII code for the letter A is 1000001. Hope this explains
584 it to you. Interesting name Morrissey, I like it. Sure you don't want to come over and see my etchings? DELTA FIVE

616 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
617   Morressey:  In addition to the meanings given above, 'parity' also has the
618 meaning of 'equal(s)' or 'peer(s)'.  Thus, "L'Homme sans Parity" also has the
619 bilingual meaning of "the man without equals."  (L'Homme -- a bit egocentric,
620 no?)  Also -- at 19, most males are not ready for long-term commitment.  The
621 juices are running a bit hot, and the little ditty applies:
622   Hogamus, Higamus,
623   Man is polygamous;
624   Higamus, Hogamus,
625   Woman monogamous.
626 As maturity sets in, males tend to concentrate more on one person, usually 
627 forming a pair bond with a female.  The danger (to the female) is that the
628 bond is not usually as intense.   pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
