25 Someone lives bleeding in a gutter somewhere.
26 So it would seem we still got a long, long way to go.  I've seen all I want

38 Are you the late "Technician" of that mode of communication??
39 
40 If that rings any bells then you most likely can guess who this is.  If it
41 means nothing to you then understand that I know of the person in which you
42 speak with a house number of "37" on "127". And that I am a continuation of this on-going ledgen.

93 Color Computer OS-9 BBS, 300 bps, from 630 in the evenings, to 530 in the
94 afternoons.  Maybe you'll like it better than BackWater.  Maybe you'll use it
95 instead.  Huh?
96 
97 Do you ever read the Personal Messages in the classifieds?  I think the basis
98 for some really strange stories are there.  One a few days ago caught my eye:
99 	EDWIN D. & SARA A. are black
100 	 hearted & God is watching your
101 	 evil doings.  God have mercy on
102 	 your soul.  J.R.
103 
104 I wonder what Eddy & Sara did to JR?  We'll never know.  Make up your own story.
105 			_innocent bysitter_
106 Some punitive rehabilitation therapy this is. Imagine being commited to this
107 planet of insane lunatics for 67 talars.Argeth! All I did was "borrow" some 
108 thionite crystals from the Roitation
109 reserch Institute. I was not using them
110 for a "unlicenced chronodistortion chamber", if I had been, no one would have
111 noticed anyway, because cosmic inertia
112 would have damped out any disturbances that I might have caused. Anyway, here I
113 am, setenced to spend a significant fraction of my life on this primitive excuse
114 for a planet, cut off from home family
115 and group mates.
116    In the name of Wemtroc, they still
117 use the internal combustion engine here.
118 When I go outside I am choked by the
119 fumes, which is ironic because I used
120 to breathe Carbon Monoxide, but was
121 force changed by a Body regeneration
122 unit, and given the outward aspect and
123 weaknesses of these ugly creatures.
124 Dry pink skin, intead of my normal lovely coat of blue-green scales. Ugly little
125 tentacle like hands and fingers instead
126 of efficient feelers. Yuccchhh!!!
127 I feel like a monster, I even have
128 to eat the food here! Ugh! Almost all
129 the food here is natural, grown in the
130 ground, or killed. No wonderful
131  slabs
132 of protein complex grown in tanks.
133 No vitaman enriched nutri-liquid, only
134 h2o to drink, although you can get it
135 in some half way decent flavors.
136 I especially like something called
137 blue creme soda. The coloring agents
138 taste wonderful! That's about the only
139 decent thing about this planet though,
140 I really miss Utrean, especially at thistime of year, when the females are in
141 season at home and are ready to recieve
142 my pollen. I am getting excited just
143 thinking about it. I tried the local
144 version of sex, taking instruction
145 from a videocassete called "Debbie does Dallas. The female I hired for the
146 purpose was apparently impressed with
147 my performance. It would seem that the
148 sex act here only takes an hour or
149 less, and does not last nearly a full
150 3 days as it does back home. 
151    The female wanted to stop after only
152 about 2 hours, but she has promised to
153 come back soon. "No charge baby, you're
154 the best!" She also liked my outward
155 appearance. Could you tell me why
156 they chose the Earth male, Tom Selleck,
157 to copy for my earthly body. He is quitepopular here, and the natives keep on
158 asking me for something called an "Autograph". Well the only "Autograph" is my
159 communication setup to Utrean and I do
160 not intend to give that away. I must
161 close for now, group brother, and I 
162 hope I will see you soon.

275 .
276     (Doesn't that blow your mind?)
277 .
278      It seems that I have been on vacation for the last couple of months.  And did I
279 bother to say I was departing?  NO!  That is lack of responsibility...
280      It also seems, however, that some very odd things have been going on and/or started
281 while I was gone.  Anyone taking responsibility for that?
282 .
283 .
284      The Swanmp Thing never did like THE BIT BUCKET.  The Swamp Thing never did use his
285 brain to figure out that-GEE-he never HAD to call the BUCKET.  TST reminds me of a certain
286                  -NDG-
287 Although I really doubt it.
288 .
289 And WHO is this Triple Five guy?  Well, at least he tells us he's here all the time.
290 Whoopee!

348 Hello fellow scribes, poets and freelancers of every sort. We're looking
349 for a littl help (possibly with spelling?). Writer's Northwest Handbook
350 is a literary directory of the NW: OR, WA, ID, MT, AK, & BC. It list 
351 writers' markets and publications/publishers of general interest, with as
352 much info as possible (& economical) on each. The first edition had over 
353 1,000 publishers of periodials or books, plus 25 short articlesand other
354 resources.
355 .
356 We're preparing the Second Edition and want to make sure we don't miss 
357 any listings. So, if you know of any publication, electronic or otherwise,
358 which ought to be listed in such a directory, please give us a call at
359 621-3911. Ask for Dennis, Linny or Doug. If you're interested in the book,
360 we'll gladly fill you in. We're working closely with the writer's groups,
361 libraries, arts commissions, teachers and other interested folks to
362 deepenthe already strong literary tradition of the region.
363 
364 					Thanks for any help you might give,

375 Not the bottom of a message. There are a lot of markers on this board.
376 There are a lot of unsigned msgs. To avoid alienating people try to avoid

400 Hmm,  no response.  I'll take that as a no.  It appears I've missed quite a
401 bit in my absence.   Could somebody fill me in as to what happened to Piper
402 and gang?  I was following their stories rather closely before I departed
403 unexpectedly and now don't see them around anymore.  What has happened to
404 them?  I hope I haven't brought back a dead subject.  Forgive me if I have.

453 Someone caught movement in the corner of his eye and yelled in warning at the
454 last possible second to enable Eugene to jump out of the way of the first
455 swing of the android.  Garret recovered  in an instant, and squeezed off two
456 rounds at it before seeing that the android was proof against bullets.
457 Nick dove for IAN1, and in a calm voice that denied the fear that welled within
458 him, began giving it detailed instructions.  Sweat formed on his brow as debris
459 from the rampaging IAN4 flew about him.
460 Farley quickly grabbed the first weapon-like object to come to hand- a 
461 soldering gun.  He cursed himself and threw the gun at the android, all the
462 while searching for something to halt it.
463 Garret kicked at it, seizing the distraction Farley had caused.  A hollow thud
464 echoed in the lab, and for a few moments the android was off balance.
465 Nick muttered the last few words to IAN1 while dodging a flying soldering gun.
466 IAN1 advanced on its twin, grabbing a beaker filled with liquid on a bench.
467 Farley had taken to throwing EVERYTHING in reach toward IAN4; most of the
468 objects missed or just broke against it with no effect, save distraction.
469 
470 IAN1 rapidly approched its mirror-image with the beaker.  With equally fast
471 response, IAN4 turned to meet his assailant.
472 It was then that Farley threw a makeshift Molotov cocktail (made from a flask
473 of ethanol, a bit of Farley's shirt, a stopper, and lit with a Bunsen burner)
474 which hit IAN4 directly on the face.
475 
476 With its visual sensors impaired, it was no problem at all for IAN1 to pour
477 the aqua reiga over IAN4's brain cavity.

493 I remember your names.  For two long years I have been without a voice.  Finally
494 I have recovered the power of speech.  Is our friendly innkeeper still his
495 jovial self ?  We met in physical form once upon a time at the original BWMS
496 conclave at an interesting place called the MT Bottle and Deli.  Tell me,
497 is the tree Pam planted still there?  Only if you know the tree will I know I 
498 have in truth found my friends.  I see that even the Man in Grey is still with
499 us.  Perhaps there is hope.  My friend, Piper, would you be so kind as to
500 play a shoort skirl to bring me stronger into focus.  I have suffered long not
501 hearing from all of you.  (Did we complete the quest ?  My memory was blanked
502 out with my speech.)

510 ave a serious inquiry for Backwater Users.  Is there, in your opinion,
511 a real reason to oppose the storage of high level nuclear waste at the
512 Hanford Nuclear Reservation ?  Or is it just a lot of political Hoopla ?
513 
514 What are the actual dangers ?  Surely such an erudite group as the BW
515 Users has investigated this question, haven't you ?  Lend me the benefit
516 f your discoveries. 
517 
518 This is being made out to be a very important issue, and it appears from
519 the news media that the reasons for choosing Hanford have nothing at all
520 to do with technical matters.  It seems entirely political.  Am I being
521 mislead by the media, or is there a "clear and present danger" ?
522 
523 ease respond on this forum if you have facts, figures, rumors, or
524 opinions.  Especially opinions.  Thanks.

580 SUGGESTED READING MATERIAL - Instalation number 256:
581 Any of the books by Spider Robinson about "Callahan's Place", a pub set on
582 the edge of time and space, where the common is uncommen and the drinks
583 very tasty, thank you.
584      Anyone who has become disalusioned with Backwater is requested to 
585 read any of the three books about this place.  Much as the INN is reality,
586 Callahan's is fantasy.  A phsycal place for the perverted and twisted such
587 as the Backwater "regulars" woudl be welcome.  The only problem being one
588 of phsyycal location: where do you locate an arranged and licensed insane
589 asylum?  Here's a glass to the INN, andt to the barkeep; for what its worth.

618 Friar, Darbon, and others:
619     BWMS has fallen to darkened days.  Piper and the gang have used thier minds and have
620 dicided, each though thier own process that this hostile environment that BWMS has become
621 is not for them.  I would only ask that you all respect their decisions, because they
622 were all intelligent creatures whose skills brought BWMS to it'S glory days.
623 .
624 .
625 .
626 DJJ:  The media cannot be trusted to cover anything.  They throw politics into every
627 battle, so don't even attempt to listen to them.  Books are the way to go.  The only way
628 to go!
