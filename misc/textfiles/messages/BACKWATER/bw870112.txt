67      I have a couple of points to comment on yet in regard to 
68 "NET" activities.  One of them is the comment made on the other 
69 disk in regard to those that complain about the "NET" are just 
70 jealous of them. 
71      I often wonder when I see people use that argument, what 
72 are they really thinking.  There is no real evidence in the 
73 previous messages to come to that conclusion.  Are they echoing 
74 an excuse taught them by mommy; "Joey said those bad things 
75 about you because he is jealous of you", and not really 
76 considering the content of the messages, or have they actually 
77 thought seriously about it and truely believe what they say. 
78      When a person says such things after due consideration and 
79 thought, I will accept and honor him in his belief whether I 
80 agree with it or not.  But, when it is made with no real thought 
81 as this comment appears to be, I have little time or patience 
82 for them.
83      The other point is directed at L'homme, who commented also 
84 on the other disk that the people who have been commenting on 
85 their own view point about NET and their activities have said 
86 such things as "NET sucks" and that "they are all assholes".
87      While I do remember one comment back there someplace to the 
88 effect of "NET sucks", it was a one liner that someone left, and 
89 not a part of a commentary left by those expressing their 
90 opinion on the subject.  But no one has said that they are 
91 "assholes" in this current thread of conversation.  I myself 
92 have used the term 'twit' in reference to NET, but I did so to 
93 express in proper terms that I don't consider streams of "YUOIT 
94 GKJHJ" as being better than "ZZ TOP RULES".  Thus if you 
95 postulate that the individual who left the message "ZZ TOP 
96 RULES" as being a twit, then by definition I would have to 
97 consider those who leave rows upon rows of alphabet soup to be 
98 of the same grouping.
99      As for NET's supposed phone harassment activities, I 
100 wouldn't know. I don't know of anyone personally who could 
101 honestly say that they were the target of such activities, so I 
102 leave that point open until it is either adaquately proven or 
103 disproven.  My opinions are based only upon the activities of 
104 the NET here on Backwater and their attitude they have presented 
105 that it is acceptable for them to respond to twitish behavior in 
106 a twitish maner, and that by some nature that they are a special 
107 group, that it somehow makes them "better" than the others.
108      I also refrain from basing pro or con comments about the 
109 "spy" stories that the NET group left on Backwater mostly 
110 because I am not an enthusiast of such things, and find them to 
111 be boring.  I will point out though that since I don't enjoy 
112 such stories that by that nature I personally don't consider 
113 them to be the "best" that has been on Backwater.
114      Of course that gives you an out, as since I don't care for 
115 those sort of stories my opinion doesn't count in your tally.

121 ***********************************************************************
122 For informational purposes, there has only been one known documented 
123 case in which a phone call was placed as a result of "twit" behavior. 
124 The particular individual was using foul language and in general 
125 disrupting activities. He left a rather simple trail to follow. The 
126 phone call was not harassing, rather it was directed at the individuals 
127 parents notifying them of his activities. Only the single call was 
128 placed and needed. The interesting point is that the individual who took 
129 it upon themself to do this  not only was *not* a member of NET, but 
130 they disliked NET because of earlier activities that were attributed to 
131 NET. Specifically modem phone calls at 3:00am. Since the individual has 
132 an unlisted number, the only way that it could have gotten out was by a 
133 sysop releasing it (not discounting that it could have been a sysop 
134 doing the harassing). The end result was that after several weeks of 
135 this the individual finally was forced to change their phone number 
136 (along with all the hassles and expense that goes with it). I can 
137 certainly understand having such negative feelings after such an 
138 incidence. But I would also like to point out that since I know the 
139 individual in question personally, I also know that they are not 
140 involved with the current "discussion" in regard to NET. Thus those that 
141 have disagreements with regard to the NET individuals have based their 
142 concepts on rumor and what they see pass for messages here on BWMS.
143 Obviously not the last word, but perhaps a few facts were in order.
144 ************************** CISTOP MIKEY *********************************
145 P.S. To the person asking above about what BWMS is, why does it exist.
146 Good question, why do any of us exist? But deep questions aside, BWMS
147 is best defined in the first 18 lines of the disk. Hardware wise it
148 consists of a data-storage device that was modified into its current
149 form. The device is called a "DiskWriter" and was built by Edge Technology,
150 It has 1K (1024 bytes) of ram memory, 8K of ROM, and 2  floppy disk drives
151 (35 track 5 1/4"). It does not have an operating system in the general
152 sense, BWMS *is* the operating system and it is burned in the 2708 EPROMs.
153 BWMS was originally put on line as a modem testing system to test the 
154 design of the PCS-103 modem that I was working on at the time. Later I
155 opened the system up to public access after private use was leading in
156 that direction anyway. BWMS was placed in operation in late '81, and went
157 public in early '82. Exact times are unknown (I wasn't keeping track of
158 such things). Archives of all data entered on BWMS starting from when it
159 went public are available at cost of reproduction. As to why does it exist
160 (or continue to exist), largely because I continue to through $22+ a 
161 month at the thing for no perspicuous reasons. But then why does anyone
162 throw money at a boat or other obviously useless hobby?  I do derive some
163 recreational value from the system, and it does provide a way to contact
164 and meet people that I would not otherwise encounter in my normal everyday
165 activities. Is it mostly for writers? Well, I suppose you could say that
166 given that the only way you can leave anything here is to 'write' it.
167 <ahem>... But, there are a large proportion of writers (or at least those
168 aspiring to write) who use the system. The writing is not good by most
169 standards, but the people here don't try to live up to any standards.
170 It is used more to test concepts and ideas, and to allow beginners
171 (and old timers) to flex their writing mussles without having to withstand
172 the scrutany of attachment to their real name. I guess the best way to
173 describe it is as a sort of "improv" club for writers. That isn't to say
174 that only writers use the system, and even they get bored with just
175 writing all the time, thus debates, political commentary, and religous
176 discussions roll through the system on a regular basis when things get
177 too boring. But BWMS always seems to return to the focus of a writer's
178 board once things settle down. The primary focus is the Backwater Inn
179 which is in a medieval setting. High tech weapons are disallowed by 
180 local natural laws, and fighting within the Inn is strongly discouraged
181 by the  Innkeeper. Most advetures take place away from the Inn, with the
182 Inn serving as a focal point to start and end them. Between adventures
183 th8 patrons like to sit around the fire and enjoy each others company.
184 The descriptions of the Inn itself are varried, and probably could only
185 be understood in full by reading the archives. But quickly put, the Inn
186 sits at a crossroads with a small stream nearby overwhich there is a
187 footbridge. There is a small courtyard in front of the Inn with a Rowan
188 tree that grows near the main entrance. There is a rear court with
189 some out buildings. Inside the description changes sometimes as well, 
190 but there is a large oak door at the entrance, there are rooms to rent
191 upstairs with an overlooking balconey, several backrooms for those who
192 wish to be alone or to discuse things in private (one of which is involved
193 in the current "door" adventure). Numerous tables and chairs and benches
194 scatered about. And a bar behind which is the entrance to the Innkeeper's
195 rooms. There is a wine cellar below under the protection of elves, and
196 of course the big fire place around which everyone likes to gather.
197 Geographically there is a city to the South, and beyond it a sea port. 
198 To the north is a dark and forboding forest (no one seems to have ever
199 come back from that direction). To the west is a dark forest, but though
200 people seem to have trouble in that direction, they usually make it back
201 alive. To the east are high mountain ranges covered with snow. That about 
202 covers the description, the details tend to change without notice as needed
203 for a story line. As to how many read the system, that changes all the 
204 time. There is a hard core group of writers of about two dozen or so, and
205 an an unknown number of readers (referred to as lurkers, people who stay
206 in the shadows watching the activities and goings on of the Inn). During
207 peak activity the system can be in use almost constantly all day and night,
208 while during slack time (usually after a heavy twit attack) things can 
209 drop back to just the core group. There are probably 100-200 people who
210 call the system more than one or twice. There is no real information to
211 this as BWMS does not have anyway of keeping track of callers. There are
212 no special treatment given to anyone, everyone has the same abilities
213 as anyone else on the system.
214 Hope this answers some of your questions.

221 Backwater, sometimes damned, other times praised. Whiners and writers in equal
222 numbers. Where else can you find such a mix of people? We have fantasy writers.
223 We have the spy people. We have the quick and dirty messages. Everything grows
224 together, and what do we have? Backwater.
225 
226 Something has been said about lines and lines of so-called gibberish. What's
227 the story on that stuff? The occasional lines of meaningless letters were not
228 really gibberish to those who know how to read them. I can't read katkana, but
229 I know better than to say it is gibberish. It made certain individuals angry in
230 not being able to read these coded messages. One way of getting back at those
231 leaving the codes messages was to leave large non-codes messages of total
232 gibberish. Just press random keys on the keyboard and feel good at getting
233 back at someone. Sounds like a good way to spend time to me.
234 
235 Backwater wasn't the optimal place to leave coded messages, but circumstances
236 sometimes dictated leaving a single message to certain people on this system.
237 What a tremendous crime. So ZZ TOP RULES is the same as a coded message. I
238 completely disagree with you. ZZ TOP RULES says nothing but inane childish
239 things about a rock group, who certainly don't think of themselves as rulers.
240 Obscenities, blank lines, deleted lines, insults, attempted uploads of old
241 backwater disks. This is the stuff twits are made of. Coded messages that
242 at least a half-a-dozen people can read are not the same, and any long winded
243 diatribes to the contrary, such as those entered by Mr. Dilks, are simply
244 misinformed and therefore unfounded.
245 
246 Since Mr. Dilks is so possessed in pointing out just how unprincipled the
247 NET writers are, why doesn't he contact them directly. If his karma contains
248 the directive to clear the air and lead the visitors of backwater to true
249 understanding, then let him log on a system that uses real names and ask
250 the same questions he asks here. I have never heard of John Dilks until now,
251 and I frequent several bulletin board systems. So what is the real story?
252 
253 I propose this Backwater/NET discussion move to another system, and let these
254 long winded arguments move on, and let the stories that have made backwater
255 such a unique place, continue. Of course Mr. Dilks and others realize that
256 several of the people insulted for their association to NET also write dozens
257 of other personas, some of which have been on the favorable end of many a
258 comment. So much for seeing through the characters to the real person behind
259 the mask.
260 
261 So what will it be? Continue on and drag down backwater and its current 'door'
262 mystery, or move along like ladies and gentlemen and let the writers have
263 access to the phone line?

308      James sighed a heavy sigh.  Damn that woman, he thought to himself.  Damn her for all she has done to me.  If it
309 weren't for her, I wouldn't have gotten in this mess in the first place.  He looked out over the barren landscape,
310 searching for a landmark he knew existed in his mind, but one that his eyes said was not there.  Damn her a third time.
311 He struggled with the memory of their first meeting back on Kadan.  She had seemed so innocent then.  Innocent.  Hah.
312 He knew much better now, too late of course to do anything about it.  A glint over a distant dune attracted his
313 attention.  Was this what he was looking for?  Quickening his pace, the sand flowed beneath his worn sole
314 shoes.  Could it be?  As he approached, his eyes grew wide.  This was not what he expected.  Topping the ridge, he saw
315 for the first time the complete picture of what lay before him, and of what had fallen behind him on this long tiresome

329 My goodness, when I made my initial "infamous NET" entry I had
330 no idea I'd stir up such a tempest. All this time I thought I
331 was the only one antagonized by the NET arrogance. Fascinating!
332 However, I too am ready to go on to something more productive

337 George, John Dilks, and others:
338     Fine, *I*'m willing to drop this. Time will tell about the others.
339 A couple of minor points:
340 1. I seem to recall that we *asked* the sysop if it was ok to post coded
341    msgs before we started. (Mike?)
342 2. One of the more interesting things about the codes (there have been
343    several, we are currently on number 5). It got to be a game. Some
344    users looked on it as a puzzle. Several NET members were "recruited"
345    this way. They cracked the code and sent us a msg in it! Others did
346    likewise but did not want to join. We of course changed the code.
347    The more difficult version withstood attack for a week or two....
348    This led to Level 3 which was almost immediately superseded by Level
349    4. Level 5 was created due to needs *other* than security. Level 4
350    was (to my knowledge) broken once. Of course, this was by the great
351    Alex, who has forgotten more about code than I'm likely to learn!
352 
353 If anyone is actually interested, I could consult with the other members
354 as the possibility of releasing the "keys" to L1, L2, and L3. I don't
355 believe that anything still needs to be kept quiet after all this time
356 (I don't *think* we used our real names in any of the msgs   :-)  )
357 RYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYRY
358 PS. as L'homme stated, the there has been *no* code from Net in at least
359 SIX MONTHS! I was halfway thru loading one of the bogus "msgs" into the
360 decode program when I realized it was supposedly from *ME*! As far as
361 can be determined those "codes" were indeed pure gibberish. (I tested
362 for *quite* a few possibilities....)

365 
366   If movement through normal space requires time (at least some at any speed),
367 then am I correct to assume that movement through time would require space? And
368 if this is so, how?
369 
370 ----------------------------------------------------------------
371      I too am willing to let the issue of NET slide.  I've made my 
372 comments and stated my reasons for them, so there is no need to 
373 repeat the same thing over as that is all that it would be if this 
374 discussion were to continue. 
375      My reason for commenting on it in the first place was to 
376 point out that to those of us who cannot (and have no desire to) 
377 read the code that is was as much gibberish as the "ZZ TOP RULES" 
378 messages, and in fact that the ZZ TOP message at least being readable 
379 gave something see that was readable.  Just because the coded 
380 message was readable by some did not make it any less gibberish to 
381 those who saw nothing but a jumble of letters. 
382      Nor have I said that those involved in the NET group were 
383 "unprincipled".  That is your word, not mine.  Nor have I 
384 commented on the personal belief structure or public mask of any 
385 specific individual involved with NET.  Again, those are your own 
386 creations from what was said.  I have however commented on the 
387 operations and activities on NET on Backwater and how I veiwed them 
388 (as have apparently others by the comments).
389      I commented on the issue because the subject was brought up.  
390 I have no intention of "leading the visitors of backwater to true 
391 understanding."  Once again, that is your construction, not mine.  
392 And, Backwater is certainly not limited to just writting stories 
393 as Mikey's last message pointed out. 
394      In regard to why you apparently haven't seen me on other systems, 
395 I don't frequent other systems except VERY rarely.  I have no desire 
396 to see yet another message about how much better an Apple is over 
397 an IBM PC, or '59 Chevy pickup for sale.  I have called other systems.  
398 I am not responsible for insuring that you see my name appearing 
399 in front of your eyes.
400      Mostly I have spent what system time I do spend here on 
401 Backwater.  And, as with everyone else, I use a pen when here, 
402 though I believe I used my name here once or twice in the past, 
403 I can't remember for sure.

433         Imagine how the sun was reflected in the marble. Polished and yet
434 chalky, the dull hue of pale white was shown everywhere on the artifaces,
435 depending where you looked from. Ivy crawled everywhere over the marble.
436 Latched around itself in places, and in narrow cracks which showed on
437 aging portions of the structures. The area was a marsh. Mountains and
438 curvatures of hill were visable through the leafless trees. In the
439 immediate area, were slowly winding rivers with overhanging cliffs of tree
440 roots and other features of wet lands. Nests abounded in the near trees.
441 Since the leaves had long since fallen into the marshes below, the nests
442 were in plain sight. As was the marble house that was on the crest, above
443 a wide bend in the river. Looking out from the aviary, you could see the
444 swirling depth of the water during storms, or the broken pattern of scales
445 when the sun was setting behind the water. As of the moment, the sky and
446 the clouds passing overhead were the only thing to be seen in the dark
447 green waters.
448         Across the river, over it for birds, was particularly stout tree.
449 Aged and not withering, it still rose every year. Even outdistancing the
450 once saplings who were then growing up around its own roots. On one of the
451 thickest and least observable branches was a peregrin falcon. People who
452 observed birds for an occupation had named it entirely differently, but it
453 was still a peregrin falcon.
454         On the marble porch there sat a girl. Her eyes were open and she
455 stared directly at the bird. She blinked and was startled when the long
456 screech would occasionally come from the falcon. Flocks of birds or ducks
457 would then avert their direction, in deference to the screech. It
458 frightened me, and I was nearly a man. Standing on a raft of my own
459 devising, I was pushing my way down the river with the help of long poles.
460 It would later find acceptance in the area as a way to get from place to
461 place, and see people, but at the time, I was the only one who had ever
462 navigated the river. Passing with the current and under the cover of the
463 brambles which hanged over the edgy shore, I stared at the girl. I gather
464 I was only one of the people who had ever stared at her. She held the same
465 aura of resilent strength and determination that the falcon did, as I
466 turned around and spotted it. Her loose white clothing billowed in the
467 wind, and her face chilled with the oncoming winds of the night. And there
468 she stayed. I had almost no idea of why she was waiting there, or what she
469 was waiting for. I rather fancy the thought that she was waiting or hoping
470 that the bird of prey who was so much like herself, would come and stay
471 near her. Also, I rather fancy there was some motivation of thought the
472 other way around, from the lone peregrin.

480 Boy, somebody HAD to do it after being issued a sick sort of challenge, didn't
481 they?  For those of you who will miss it I am referring to the 'ZZ TOP RULES'
482 graphic (if you could call it that) that was posted soon after John Dilk's 
483 (pardon if I misspelled) entry.  Well, I have one more thing to say, and then 
484 I will bother you no more with this thought.  If all of you are so eager to go
485 on to other things, why don't you just do it and quit being so long winded?

505   An uproar had risen around several of the tables.  Voices were raised,
506 emotions roiled, but the discussion stayed peaceful, albeit heated.  The
507 piper roused partway from slumber, thought breifly about joining the 
508 discussion, then decided that it was really pointless.  Just as he was
509 about to drop off to sleep again, he heard the dread slogan!

517 O you deep-scheming son of rightminded Themis, against your will and mine with
518 ineluctable brass I am nailing you down to this rock away from men, where you
519 will never hear the voice or see the sight of any mortal, and, scorched by
520 the sun's bright fire, the flower of your flesh will shrivel, and you will
521 be glad when rich-clothed night shall hide away the day, and when once more
522 the sun scatters the frost at dawn. Always the load of what you suffer at
523 the moment will oppress you, since your saviour has not yet been born. This
524 is your reward for your idea of helping men. Yourself a god, you did not
525 shrink from wrath of gods, and gave to man promotion beyond what is right. 
526 And therefore you will now be sentry of this joyless rock, standing upright
527 not sleeping, not bending the knee. There will be many sighs and many useless
528 groans that you will utter. Zeus's mind is hard to turn by prayer, and all
529 whose power is new are hard hearted.

546 John, I'll accept your statement that you didn't start the argument. But
547 then who did? From reading the last few disks I can't see that NET did. 
548 Unless you count the responses to the false Ian MacHinery entry as starting
549 the argument!
550 George, did you? Since the original entry was unsigned we can't tell who 
551 started it. But _I_ tend to think it was unprovoked.
552 
553 Now as for the arguments themselves.... John, did you miss Ian's comment
554 that *non-NET* people were reading the code *on their own*. It was no more
555 gibberish than a foriegn language is. But I can understand your objection.
556 Ian, you have to admit that towards the end of the *real* NET postings
557 you people were getting carried away. I seem to recall a 100 or so line 
558 ciphertext?
559 Everybody, while this is the closest to a well-reasoned debate we have had 
560 in many a moon,(stand up and take your bows!) it still could have been
561 better. When you say something and the other guy responds, you should not
562 merely repeat your coments (or minor variations thereon). Neither should
563 you merely quietly drop some of your comments. You should acknowledge the
564 points that have been refuted. If you still believe that the rest of your
565 points are still good, you should explain what was wrong with the counter-
566 arguments put against them. Ok? We'll get a lot farther this way....

580 The door of the inn opened in the middle of the groups discussion. A 
581 tall curly headed man strode into the
582 room and walked to the bar. He was dressed in a long coat and had a 
583 ridiculously long scarf wrapped around
584 his body. "A ginger beer please". He
585 began to pull objects out of his coat pockets. A half eaten apple, a 
586 compass, bags of candy, a magnifying
587 glass, a long cylyndrical rod with a
588 rounded head, and many other objects
589 were soon piled up on the bar. Finally
590 the stranger found what he was looking
591 for. A few coins were quickly given
592 to the innkeeper in exchange for the
593 ginger beer.

600 I happen to be one of those infrequent visitors to Backwater.  Having read
601 through the "debate" over NET, I must say that things like this are what
602 keep me comming back.  Far too many of us have become more like our computers than we would 
603 like to believe.  It is refreshing to read stories and arguments that have
604 come fresh from the human mind rather than a pre-programmed can!  Some of 
605 the arguments are better than the others but the same can be said of the 
606 stories.  A twit is a twit, whether he leaves his mark on a message system
607 or the wall of a public toilet.  If he can be identified he should be 
608 punished; if not, he might as well be ignored and your energies saved for 
609 things more useful.  I thank you all.  I wish I could write as well as you.
