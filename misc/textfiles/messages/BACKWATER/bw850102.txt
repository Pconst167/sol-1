21 (Gasp, choke)  What?  On top again?  It's AMMMMAAAAAZZZZINNNGGGGG!
22 L'homme: I believe that there is a PSU stayover of some sort for potential incoming freshmen... the 12th?  I'm not
23 sure, but beware, I'm coming...
24 Also, looking at last disk, you sure have become a target, haven't you?  What socially unacceptable thing did you do in
25 public to deserve that?
26 #$##$##$##$##$##$##$##$#
27 Clunk.
28 That's the last noise I heard before I blacked out.
29 I was in my room, quietly cleaning my gun (as I do when I am bored), when I heard a noise in the bath.  I, of course,
30 went to investigate, with Besty in hand.  I must have played right into their hands... I never even saw who hit me.
31 Pity, too... I'm looking forward to personally giving that guy a lump that matches mine.
32   awoke from my 'little nap'.  I still felt a little dizzy, but it passed.  I was in a 5 x 5 cubicle in which there 
33  as two breaks in the metal of the walls- the door, and the 2' x 1" ventilation slot.  The cot I had been resting on
34  as of the tubular aluminum type, too light to do any smashing.  The small amount of light I got was emitted from the 
35 florecent lamps 10 feet or so above my head.
36 I quickly searched my pants pockets.  Keys, wallet, money... all gone.  My 'com, too.  I had been throughly searched.
37 Nothing to do but wait.
38 #$##$##$##$##$##$##$##$##$##$#
39 I began to hear distant voices.  I was able to piece together a conversation.
40 "...and you know, John sold this guy the last FD-78 just before we knew about Joshua.  Eugene Farley, his name is. 
41 It's a good thing we recovered that ID card, or we'd have been another one of John's 'failure statistics'."
42 Quickly, I went to the cot, and laid down.  I had to act the opossum part for a little while.  I closed my eyes.
43  hey stopped in front of my cell.  "Still out.  I can't wait until he's not useful anymore.  I do hope that John picks
44   suitable end for him."
45  t was very hard to keep a blank face while listening to that, but I tried my level best.  The other began:
46 "Not until the 'penathol.  John wants to know exactly what Farley got from his file.  It's erased now, but still..."
47 Of course!  A data tap on that file.  But what about UNDOUND..?
48 "Did he erase the master files, while he was at it?"
49 "No, they're still useful, for some strange reason.  No telling what John has planned.  Well, no change in him, so
50 let's go back to security."
51 It wasn't the conversation this time that attacted my attention.  I had heard, barely, the near-silent drop of a card.
52 After making sure the guards were a good distance away, I looked out the door.
53 Yes!  Just as I'd hoped.  One of the men dropped his passcard.  And well within reach.  Things were looking up.
54  hoa!  Things were looking *TOO* up.  There was a catch here.  I scanned the bars quickly.
55   small blue wire was attached to the metal of the door.
56  miling faintly, I turned to the cot.  A few minutes of 'silent violence' were inflicted upon the cot.  Shortly, I had
57 a thin strip of aluminum with a sharp end on it.
58 I took off my shirt, and wrapped it around my hand.  Then, I grasped the strip with what I hoped was my insulated hand.
59 This time, my hopes held.  I felt no shock as I slid the strip through the bars, sawing at the wire.  A few moments 
60 later, and it was done.
61 Now I reached out of the cell, for the card.  Slowly, I scraped it closer and closer to the cell with my fingertips.
62 It was mine!  I fumbled with the card for a moment, then inserted it into the slot near the locking mechanism.
63 A quiet whine was the only sound made, but my eyes were greeted by the view of an open door.  I quickly made use of it.
64 No one about... but I had to make sure.  Any number of things might go wrong as I tried to get out of here....

77 The following is UNOFFICIAL!
78         *I* would not be upset if a few people who were working on the  
79 "fringes" of the NET were to return. Especially the "agents" who told
80  he kid to "get into the paper". As long as they don't try to mess with
81  IGH LEVEL operations (like L'homme, Joshua, et al), they could do well
82  s (pardon the expression) "junior agents".
83         After all, junior agents aren't expected to know the correct
84 procedures for everything. If they did they'd be SENIOR agents!

86 L'homme: I hope you at least saved the line numbers...
87  In any case, why don't we save a step. I'll take single-sided
88 NEWDOS disks like the ones you've been making for voyeur. I can copy from
89 those myself. Also, how much trouble would it be to make a backup set of
90 MS-DOS originals as soon as you get them? (I'd be supplying the disks...)

96 Ian MacHinery: Thanks for the (semi)formal invitation! It has pleased me
97     greatly!   Don't think too much less of me to ask, but what do you 
98     think of my entries. It may be all too apparent that I write (type)
99     them "on the spot" with only the basic idea to get me started. After
100     I enter the lines, I have a friend (I think I can call him that) look
101     it over and he does nothing but laugh. Is this because it is humorous,
102     or because of my stupidity?     I try to make them entertaining, as a
103     few things in life should be, and I don't think that I'll change the
104     kid, Rosewood, or Taggart too much in the future. Thanks again, 01.

131   Omega looked down at the soggy food given to him. Wet eggs with some weird
132 jello or something. Anyway, after grimacing at what he was going to eat, later,
133 much later, much much later, Omega looked again at the equally somber faces
134 looking at their meals.
135   "Sorry for the quality of the food, we are using only the stuff the funding
136  llows for. Which means not too deliscious food, for a while."
137   Everyone laughed at the use of the word deliscious in the same breath as this
138 
139 
140   "Did you think about what I mentioned? The possibility that a mind block, put
141 in for security reasons may have malfunctioned. That is may have erased every
142 part of his memory?" Omega was sorry to suggest such a piteous fate for someone
143 as illustrious as Joshua, master agent of net.
144 
145   "I thought about it quite alot, actually. Stepping through the process we use
146  n most agents, no. It could not have happened. However, with sokme of the NET
147 elite, we used a process with a much stronger, and potentially more devastating
148 effect. It works on a very important principle which I really don't know how 
149 to explain. Suffice it to say, yes, what you have suggested could have happened
150 with the conditions you have outlined." Doctor Kyle Lloyd finally ate that
151 piece of egg he had been holding aon his fork for five minutes.
152 
153   Omega was stunned at how confusing the Doctor had made things seem. All that
154  e needed to know was that he was right, agent Joshua could have lost all his
155  emories. Even could have been reborn, so to speak. Trained at everything again
156 but this time, Dangerfield might have appeared as a father figure to him.
157 
158   Dangerfield, mastering one of the op eight agents of NET? IOmega was slightly
159 awed. All of his career, NET was the most stable thing he could think of. This
160 changed all that, now Joshua could not be trusted implicitly anymore. Damn!
161 
162   By the time everyone had decided that they coyuld not avoid things any longer
163 and actually ate their breakfast, Omega was already preparing his gear for the
164 trip back to Ian Machinery, for a personal report on the Joshuasituation.
165 
166   A wall panel shrilled, and a communications plate lit bright red. Omega hit
167 the listen button, and promptly dropped his single pann. It made a loud noise,
168 hell, it woke some lab animals. Anyway, back to the communications at hand.
169   "Omega, may I speak to you. In my quarters please, it is important. It has to
170 do with the Joshua situation." Doctor Lloyd made a click noise, it took a while
171 for Omega to realize that he had turned off the send button.
172 
173   Omega slipped his submachine gun into it's proper place, ain his side holster
174 and slid his pack around his shoulders. All packed, now only parting words to
175 Doctor Lloyd, and he would trudge back to the Oklahoma city office and Ian for
176 his report.
177 
178   Walking down the flourescent lit halls, finding the quarters that looked the
179 most official was not hard. Doctor's always lilked having their name on their
180 own shingle. The door was clearly marked.
181 
182   Omega stepped in, and approached a neat desk. Looking around, he saw no one,
183  nd nothing really unusual. Omega expected that the Doctor made the call from
184  ne of the labs, and would be there shortly.
185   No one came in a few minutes, Omega stepped behind the desk, intending to sit
186 for a while. A small indentation on the carpet attraced his attention.  Nothing
187 weird, laboratory installations are full of weird markings and indentations.
188 
189   For lack of anything else to do, Omega started tapping at the floor. Soon,
190 Omega had started to read some of the papers on Lloyd's desk.
191   Some were simply standard NET information requests, and one was a notice from
192 the United States Marine Corps. It said that a Kyle Lloyd Junior was killed in
193 a terrorist action in Paraguay. It also stated the he had saved others and won
194 a posthumous medal from courageus gallantry. Omega was sorry for Looyd Senior.
195   Omega got tired of tapping away at the floor, and decided to look at what he
196 had been tapping away at before. Kneeling, he peeled back the carpetting to
197 reveal a small keypad. Itt was not the standard lettering of NET, and it was
198 definately not a private safe. NET would have known.
199   Omega looked at the small diplay, it was marked with 212114, a series? No, no
200 one in their right mind would place the combination in plain sight. Except
201 perhaps an absent minded professor. Always forgetting things, it made sense.
202 
203   Omega slowly entered 212114 in series then pressed enter, and waited.
204   The small keypad only mentioned that he had gotten the right access, and that
205 it was getting ready for entry. Entry, what was that? Another code? Omega
206 waited, and soon heard the telltale sound of a pneumatic action. Something was
207 well protected inside this safe. Well protected except for the combination on
208 public notice. After thirty seconds, tired of kneeling, Omega stood. And saw a
209 large telivion screen that must have raised soon after Omega pressed the series
210 in.
211 
212   Another series of numbers was displayed, along with a set of keys. Still, the
213  ettering was odd. Omega hit the communications panel and told a technician to
214  ell Doctor Lloyd that he wad been called away suddenly and didn't have time to
215 visit his quarters. TNow, Lloyd would stay at the Lab and Omega could proceed
216 again, with no interuptions.
217   Omega pressed the appropriate series, and the telivision screen started to
218 fade into a picture...

274 AMMENDUM to regular weekly report :     Case concerning strange appearance of
275   sheep inside the city limits. One of our roving trucks spotted the sheep
276  itting in a car in the parking lot of a NW Portland apartment building.
277  he sheep was making quite a bit of noise, and had defecated several times
278 on the interior of the car. The animal control truck took possession of the
279 sheep, and Speed's Towing took the car away. A search for the owner of the
280 sheep turned up nothing.
281 On an examination of the sheep, Dr. Ue, our local on-staff vet, discovered
282 a rare virus present in the blood stream. It appears to be mutated hybrid
283 version of SAIDS. Dr. Ue fears anyone in close contact with the sheep could
284 have contracted the disease. Fortunately, the drivers who picked up the
285 animal were wearing protective clothing, having just picked up a rabid dog
286 two blocks away.
287 Dr. Ue is unsure what effect SAIDS virus could have on humans. We have
288 contacted the poison and disease center in Atlanta, and the Capote clinic
289 in San Francisco for help with this situation. Further details will be
290 relayed to you as they become available.

337 MYSTREY BUS JOY-RIDE LEAVES OFFICIALS WITH NO ANSWERS
338 PORTLAND, Oregon (AP)
339 
340      Portland City Police and Three-Cities officials refuse to comment on the
341 late night escapade of the stolen Hoot-Owl line bus somewhere in the Gresham
342 area.     This reporter was able to locate the former Three-Cities driver on
343 the morning after the incident for his comment. Here is Wiley Steeple's rerply.
344      "Ah never seen nuthin' like it before! That kid jus' pushed me offa ma
345 own bus an took over from there. Ah don't believe it. Wut wuz I ta do?"
346      Obviously the Transit officials figured out what they would do after 
347 relieving him of his duties. Their plans include the much needed "plainclothes
348 checker" system that many bus patrons have been asking for for so long. To
349 prevent any further such thefts in the future, buses will be outfited with a
350 new driver identification device.
351      These plainclothes checkers will be riding the buses randomly to make
352 certain that their drivers are indeed who their ID devices say they are, and
353 that policies for traffic safety and customer protection are being followed.

359      A rather suspicious parcell was received this morning at the Three-Cities
360 Main Branch Office that had some of the workers in the administration depart-
361 ment worried. An executive, Wiley Rowan, called the city police in to make 
362 absolutely certain that the parcell in question would not be a bomb-threat to
363 the office and surrounding areas.    When the Portland City Police arrived at
364 the scene of what was believed to be the "bomb", the area had already been
365 evacuated of all customers and office workers. Once the parcell was uncovered,
366 it was found to contain only a message and two six-pacs of Pepsi-Cola. The 
367 police have released the note for publication, and have found the soft drinks
368 to be of the non-explosive nature. The note reads as follows-
369 		   Sorry for taking the owl.
370 		 I was a little late. Here are
371 		 some colas for the troubles.
372 		 (signed) the kid
373      Officials believe that this may have something to do with the recently
374 abandoned stolen Hoot-Owl bus a few days ago. Wiley Rowan was not open for 
375 these or other questions.

379                     An Open Letter To My Husband.
380 
381 To My Darling Husband,
382 
383   I am sending you this letter in a bogus software company envelope so that
384 you will be sure to read it. Please forgive the deception, but I thought you
385 should know what has been going on at home since your apple computer entered
386 our lives two years ago.
387   The children are doing well. Tommy is seven now and is a bright, handsome
388 boy. He has developed quite an interest in the arts. He drew a family portrait
389 for a school project. All of the figures were good, but yours was excellent!
390 The chair and the back of your head are very realistic. You would be very 
391 proud of him.
392   Little Jennifer turned three in September. She looks a lot like you did at
393 that age. She is an attractive child and quite smart. She still remembers that
394 you spent the whole afternoon with us on her birthday. What a grand day for
395 Jen, despite the fact that it was stormy and the electricity was out.
396   I am also doing well, I went blond about a year ago and was delighted to
397 discover that it really is more fun! Lars - I mean - Mr. Swenson, the 
398 department head, has taken an interest in my career and has become a good
399 friend to us all. I have also discovered that the household chores are much
400 easier since I realized that you didn't mind being vacuumed, but that feather
401 duster made you sneeze.
402   The house is in good shape. I had the living room painted last spring. I'm
403 not sure if you noticed it. I made sure that the painters cut air holes in
404 the drop cloth so you wouldn't be disturbed.
405   Well, my dear, I must be going. Uncle Lars - Mr. Swenson, I mean - is taking
406 us all on a ski trip and there is packing to do. I have hired a housekeeper
407 to take care of things while we are away. She'll keep things in order, fill
408 your coffee cup, and bring your meals to your desk, just the way you like it.
409 I hope you and the Apple have a lovely time while we are gone. Tommy, Jen
410 and I will think of you often - try to remember us while your disks are 
411 booting.
412 
413                                                 Love,
414                                                           Mary.
415 ---------------------------------
416 Just though I would type that in.  I thinks it's kind of cute myself.
417 I just hope the family goes out skiing while I am typing this in...

464      having found refuge near the bulding, sheela waited for petrov to return.
465 the car with the sheep in it had been towed and Sheela was pleased the varmit
466 was out of petrov's life. 
467      the tempature was falling and sheela was getting cold. Time to move
468 on.  No sign of petrov, oh well it's for the better anyway, I'm just
469 torturing myself.  Gee I don't feel to good.

471  eems we have a few lines disappearing around here.  I did a little

480 Gaius was beginning to wonder exactly what was going on here. He'd ordered the MK XXXIX to take care of all of the
481 NET operatives in the files over a week ago, and yet his observers in Portland said that Joshua had been seen alive
482 and kicking, or at least driving. Joshua should have been one of the ealy targets, as he was known to be in the
483 vicinity. Even with the delay while the Device worked its way north from the automated base at the bottom of Crater
484 Lake, Joshua should have bought it no later than the first. Here it was the fourth already and No Dead Joshua. 
485 Perhaps the commands were given in error? No, he'd given it a broad field of targets, but Joshua fit quite well
486 within that field. Could there be an error in the program? Two hours of examining source code gave him the answer 
487 he needed: someone had tampered with the Mk. XXXIX's programming. It was set to respond to a command to kill all NET
488 operatives by first killing all known NET impersonators. Even more disturbing, once they were all gone the Device 
489 would start picking targets at random from the phone book. Such wanton killing upset Gaius terribly; it was bad for
490 his image. Maybe it wasn't too late to stop it...

498 
499 So the Device hadn't started on the civilians yet...that was good, but there was no way to cut it off once it was 
500 started. Damn failsafes! He'd had it done that way to prevent tampering when on a mission, but was regretting the 
501 choice now. Oh, well. Nothing for it but to go into the field and see if he could stop it himself. Gaius finished 
502 his by now cold coffee, checked his weapons and made ready to leave. As a last-minute thought he added a sheet of 
503 reflective mylar to his regular kit; getting hit by the Device's laser could be most unpleasant...

506 Farley:   Could it be that the FD-78 is a mixed-up '78 ForD?          Naw...
507 Ian:   I told you, you really ought to be more careful! Now just look at
508     what has happened! This could stir up international reprisals! But did you
509     make absolutly positive that all MGP codes were correct?  "Sure," you said.
510     Now we're just going to hope we get that missle back befor The Academy gets
511     their little paws on it. "I told you so!" Chips or no chips, this was
512     uncalled for! Next time you try another one of your new remote control toys
513     do it at Vandenburg or somewhere closer. Okay?  But why Finland for 
514     goodness sakes? that could hurt relations you know...    Agent "Quantus"

521      Ontho and Leo have been getting to know each other again, and
522 the last few days had been fun.   Alex felt a little left out of the
523 celebration but he would be ok.  
524      Alex had heard of another organzation that might accept him as a
525 junior member if he cracked a code, unfortunatly he hadn't been able
526 to get a hardcopy of the said code.  (this is a plea for help folks).
527 And his mind was filling of thoughts of missions and intrigue. Leo
528 was getting boring anyway and her and Ontho seemed pretty happy. The
529 elders had reported a drifting pirate ship on the atlantic, but that's
530 another story.  So leo and Ontho are temporarly unemployed, or untill
531 something odd needs to be corrected.  Alex knew he could be of excellent
532 use to the NET because of his telepathic skills, but nothing could be
533 dont untll the code was solved.  I'm just going to have to lurk untill
534 something shows up.

539   Dan relaxed as the elevator descended.  The man wearing the inkblot watched
540 with a smile on his face.  Soon Dan felt the elevator slowing.  A loud beep
541 sounded from the elevator's controls and the back wall split into five
542 sections.  Two of these sections revolved revealing two pads flanked by chrome
543 rails.  The man wearing the inkblot waved toward one.
544   "You'd better brace yourself against the cushion and hold on."
545   Imitating the other, Dan stepped next to the wall, leaned against the pad,
546 and grabbed the two rails.  As though his touch had been some sort of signal,
547 he felt a tremendious force pressing him back against the padding.  The 
548 pressure soon eased, and Dan became aware of a subtle vibration filling the
549 "elevator."  He turned inquiringly to his companion.
550   The man wearing the inkblot turned with a smile,  "Hang on, we've got
551 at least one manuver coming aa    uuuuuu                  oo    p."
552   With his words, the elevator made a rather complicated motion.  Dan spent
553 a short time attempting to visualize the motion, but the attempt left him
554 feeling rather ill.  However, the manuever must have reversed the orientation
555 of the elevator with respect to its path, for when they felt a force begin
556 to press them back in the cushions, the man wearing the inkblot smiled.
557   "We're about home," he announced cheerfully.
558   The elevator slid to a stop.  Dan watched anxiously as the doors hissed open,
559 revealing a wide, brightly lit corridor.
560   "Let's get you settled."  With this, the man wearing the inkblot set off
561 down the corridor, followed by a somewhat reluctant Dan.

569      Once, long ago and far away, a wise teacher was giving
570     instructions to a group of followers. It was the occasion
571      of their departure into the world, to spread the word.
572                      The message was brief:
573           Whether you turn to the right or to the left,
574                 Justification is in the content.
575 
576 When the teacher had departed there was much discussion as to the
577  meaning of the words. Some felt that it had meant that they were
578  to align themselves to the right since that was the first choice
579                                      that the teacher had spoken.
580 
581 Others felt that the meaning was to turn away from the right and
582 to justify themselves with the left. This they did with great
583 vigor and condemnation of the rightists.
584 
585 Still others  were just  as certain  that neither  of  the  other
586 groups had perceived a true meaning of the master's  words. Their
587 interpretation was  that the  proper course  was to  broaden  the
588 scope of existence to justify both the right and the left.
589 
590                With TIME, TRAVEL, & EXPERIENCE ALL
591                returned to the center of the path.
