46      Leo was relaxing at the Inn, actually she seemed interested in
47 young prometheus who was lurking around in the corner. He seemed like
48 he might make a good pente partner. But, Leo thought of Alex's advice
49 to cool it on making friends untill here carear was firmer. The Innkeeper
50 was being quite attentive, keeping her in herbal tea. Suddenly the door
51 of the Inn blew open and in tramped 4 bedraggled travelers mumbling
52 something about tired feet and exhausted craniums. "It seems like we
53 are always solving puzzles just a second to late!" They paid no atten-
54 tion to Leo and pulled up chairs at what seemed "their" table. The Inn
55 keeper drew up stong dark drafts to satifiy the newly arrived customers.
56      Leo seemed content with her tea and thought of the later hour. She
57 and Ontho had to make an early start tommorow and were instructed not
58 to return untill the evil force in Iceland was under control. The next
59 plan would be to follow undetected a craft seen near a explosion. And
60 see where it leads them.  Ontho and the Elders had put toghther a 
61 invisablilty sheild for their disk, first of its kind seen, err not seen.
62      Leo finished her tea, paid the Innkeeper and tiped him generously,
63 "you have been most kind, pray for me and my companion on this journey
64 we begin tomorrow". the Innkeeper was surprized at Leo's words and did
65 not respond. Leo just smiled and left closing the door on the laughter
66 of the tired travelers

69   Just a word to the new writers (yes, you too, ex-deleter)--
70 Please don't take a seeming indifference as a snub.  I for one, begin entries
71 with the full intention of replying to one or more of you if possible.  It's 
72 just not always possible.  If I'm working on a story line of my own, or in the
73 midst of trying to find just the right words to reply to someone else without
74 unwittingly hurting their feelings (if I hurt someone, I prefer that it be
75 intentional) or dreging some obscure reference from this tired old brain, I
76 forget to include the answer.  Oh, yes!  I begin to feel guilty for the amout
77 of disk space and connect time that I am taking, also!
78   Apologies aside, please keep writing!  Nearly every serious attempt made 
79 lately has a lot going for it.  Remember though, let your characters feel what
80 goes on around them.  If someone sees a beautiful sight, what does it do to
81 them inside?  Does it make them suddenly feel soft and warm, like a lick from
82 a puppy's tounge, exhilarated like reaching the bottom of a downhill ski run,
83 what?  It's possible to simply put down the facts of a story, but the real
84 pleasure in reading it is to know the characters.  We know them through two
85 main channels, how they react to each other and what the author tells us
86 about their feelings.  Continue -- persevere -- you are welcome here!

91      The children received much advice as to how the seventeen parcels of
92 land should be divided. Some said that they should sell the land and divide
93 the proceeds according to the formula given in the WILL. Others thought they
94 should just ignore the WILL and divide the property evenly.
95      None of the suggested options would satisfy all the children. Finally
96 they decided that the WILL had been some kind of riddle, left by the monarch,
97 to guide them. Perhaps to find a new teacher, someone to guide them wisely,
98 as the monarch had. They decided to set out to find this person who could
99 solve the riddle of the WILL.
100      They traveled far and wide in search of the answer to the riddle. Time
101 and space are too small to recount the many adventures and mishaps that
102 befell them along the way. Many times one or the other would be discouraged
103 to the point of quitting. On these occasions they would gain encouragement
104 from each other. This gave them the strength to continue the search.
105      One afternoon as they were resting and refreshing themselves, along
106 came a stranger walking slowly down the dusty road. Being kindly folk they
107 offered to share food, drink, and shade. Soon the talk drifted around to the
108 riddle of the WILL. The children recited the conditions for the division of
109 the seventeen parcels of land. After so many repetitions it had almost become
110 a ritual chant.
111      When the children had finished the stranger smiled and said,
112 "The answer to the riddle is simple but it requires one more element. I have
113 some land of my own from which I will add one more parcel, equal in size to
114 the seventeen you already have. One third of that is exactly six parcels,
115 which go to the oldest. That leaves twelve more parcels to distribute. A one
116 third share of this would be four parcels, and a one twelfth share would be
117 one parcel. We give four each to two of you and one each to the other three.
118 After these eleven parcels are removed we have one left, my original parcel,
119 which can be returned to me."

147                   INSPIRATION FOR THE UNHAPPY
148 Once upon a time there was a little sparrow who hated to fly south for
149 the winter.  He dreaded the thought of leaving his home so much that he decided
150 he would delay the journey until the last minute.  After bidding a formal
151 farewell to his friends, he went back to the nest and stayed there for an
152 additional four weeks.  Finally, the weather turned so bitterly cold that he
153 could delay no longer.  As the little bird took off and started to fly south,
154 it began to rain.  In a short time, ice began to form on his little wings.
155 Almost dead from cold and exhaustion, he fell to earth in a barnyard. 
156 As he was breathing his last breath, a horse walked out of the barn and
157 proceeded to cover the little bird with fertilizer.  At first the little sparrow
158 could think of nothing, except that this was a terrible way to die.
159 But as the fertilizer started to sink into his feathers, it warmed him and
160 life began to return to his little body.  He also found that he had
161 enough room to breath.  Suddenly the little sparrow was so happy that he 
162 started to sing.  At that moment a large cat came into the barnyard.
163 Hearing the chirping of the bird, he began digging into the fertilizer
164 to find out where the sound was coming from.  The cat finally uncovered
165 the bird and ate him.
166 
167 This story contains three morals:
168 1.  Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy.
169 2.  Not everyone who takes shit off you is your friend.
170 3.  When you are warm and comfortable, even if it is in a pile of shit,
171     keep your mouth shut.

176 .. Ubtain lasguns. The forman stopped in his tracks seeing the guns a warm
177 felling came into him the feeling that it was his end.Getho raised his las
178 gun and fired directly at the forman, the shot pirced his head in a clean 
179 cut. There was no blood or brain shed since the lasguns enable the user to 
180 a silent clean shot which breaks all nervous system bonds on the victum. As
181 the forman fall to the floor the gathering turned to see what had happened,
182 as one of the droids in the front turned his eyes caught those of Ramcos. 
183 Ramco stared deeply into his eyes and saw sudden fear erupt in the droid. As
184 he continued to stare he noticed something odd about the eyes something that
185 bothered him extremly, the eyes of his counter part had no thought behind 
186 them. He tought," when i look into the formans or any other outer gaurds 
187 eyes i see something there, its not just blank like this workers seem to be."

190      It was late on a bitterly cold winter night.  I think I had been
191 walking for too long, the cold night air was starting to pierce through
192 my small coat.  Just a few more miles and I'll be there, I couldn't believe
193 this was happening to me.  I haven't bee able to come home for years.  I
194 gripped my coat around my throat and walked on.  I could barely see the side
195 of the raod it was so foggy.  I was fealling so wonderfull in side I almost
196 didn't hear the truck comming up behind me.  I spun around as it rushed by,
197 the big tires spraying the wet slush that was on the ground all over me.
198 This was just great, but I was in too good a mood to be messed up about a
199 little water.  I turned and started to walk again.  I started to sing a little
200 song that I once sung when I used to live at home.  A small song that reminded
201 me about the lovely trees and the playfull waterfall.  Oh, I wished I could
202 hurry and get there so I could lay in the front lawn watching the fluffy
203 clouds float by.  Only a few more miles and I'll be there, can't stop now.

233 another destructive person since we nave enough already, the seiks in india,
234 reagan,the sandanistas in nigaragua,the nazi war crimunals that are still 
235 alive, and such. So from the comments of people on this board and my own 
236 power of reasoning I have decided to change and input something creative
237 instead of rampage,pillage,and plunder and all around destroy.

264 Archivers: I will be making changes in the way I archive things
265 This is caused by several things, one the increasing expense
266 of 8 inch disks. Since I maintain double archives (having learned
267 in the past that when dealing with that much information you
268 will always have some disk error problems.) this means I have
269 two 8 inch disks for every archive disk. Two it is a pain in
270 the neck to setup the thing to do the archives. Fire up the
271 8 inch system, load COPYLINK, turn on the filter, take BWMS
272 off line boost the baud rate to 1200, turn on the line numbers,
273 then realize I don't have any formated 8 inch disks, go back to
274 the system load format routine, format system disk (Arghhh!), 
275 dig up backup system disk, copy files back on to system disk,
276 load format routine. put blank disk in drive run format, take
277 disk out and throw on trash can because it wouldn't format,
278 put another blank disk in and format it, reload COPYLINK, 
279 turn filter on again (I got to run the custom command one
280 of these days, but there never seems to be enough room on 
281 the disk.) take current disk out of BWMS put old disk to
282 be archived in, open file on 8 inch system to save the data,
283 type LIST, twidle thumbs while transfer is taking place, close
284 file on 8 inch system, turn off BWMS, put next archive disk
285 in BWMS, open next file on 8 inch system, type LIST again,
286 twidle thumbs again, close file on 8 inch system, turn off
287 BWMS, put next disk to be archived in, ect..., run out of
288 space on 8 inch disk, go back to system, run format routine
289 again format system disk again (SOB) recopy files from backup
290 again, format new disk, reload COPYLINK again, open file, ect...
291 finally done, go back to system, format another disk (why didn't
292 I format them all ahead of time?) (This time I didn't format
293 the system disk wow!) copy new BWMS archive disk to archive 
294 backup disk, get disk error in file, reload COPYLINK, retransfer
295 bad file, go back to system copy bum file, format another disk,
296 create new archive disk off of good backup disk, throw bad disk
297 in trash, carfully put disks away in box, put current disk
298 back in BWMS, put it back on line, go to bed and sleep it off.
299 ************************************************************:
300 I will now be copying the disks directly on my 5 inch cpm system,
301 This way I don't have to take BWMS off line for 4 to 5 hours to
302 do the archiving, and, it is a whole bunch faster. The problem is
303 that the format is still weird, the CPM system uses the same
304 format as BWMS does, (18 sectors per track) but is a bit bigger
305 (40 tracks instead of 35) it also uses the back side for a total 
306 of 80 tracks, track 0 on the back side is track 41. I can however
307 still upload to 8 inch, so no problem there. The 5 inch cpm system
308 only holds 171K instead of 250K though, so not as much archival
309 storrage. I have thought about saving as double density, but
310 my CPM machine is the only one in the world that uses my DD format
311 (26 sectors per track (128 byte sectors)) and again, track 0 on
312 the back side is recalculated as track 40. (I thought about rewritting
313 it to be in MSDOS format, but I haven't had the time (use what works)).
314 Anyway, what all this means, is no more line numbers, I can regenerate
315 them if you prefer, (just more code in the copy routine). I will
316 also no longer be filtering control characters (with the exception
317 of control Z which is used by CPM and MSDOS as a end of file mark,
318 so can't have it floating around in there!) Again, I can filter out
319 the control chars if you want, only a little bit more code to deal 
320 with. And finally, the startup information (file open number of lines
321 margin, ect..) will not be there, again, I can poke it in if you 
322 want. What I need to know, is do you want line numbers or not,
323 do you want filtering or not, do you want header or not. And for
324 that matter, do you want archives anymore or not?
325 (It's eight o'clock, so tell me, what am I still doing at work?
326 I think I'll go home....

329 Mikey: actually, the new archive format is what most of us are editing our
330 archives to look like. (i.e. removing the header [after 200 of them, it
331 gets redundant], removing line numbers, etc.)  As far as the disk format
332 itself, I shall leave it to L'homme to comment on, since he seems to be the
333 one in charge of conversions.

353 WHY DON'T YOU try using original ideas rather than copying them out of a book?
354 THAT'S WHY SOME people call is so that they can view original writing.
355 The story was only a continuation.  Every action that took place in it was
356 mine.  Since the fourth book is finaly here, I won't bother making up anymore
357 continuations.  Why do you capitalize the first three words?  Also, why didn't
358 you sign your name?  I always like knowing who's views are being expressed...

361 OK, MiG, here's a comparison of Repo Man and Buckaroo Banzai.
362 In Repo Man, daily life is sleazy, unjust and senseless.  The hero is a
363 creep and a sinner, but he's got style (business suit-punk) and he's always
364 SEEKING-mostly for ways to rip people off and for sex, but occasionally for
365 truth.  The only real difference between him and the villains is that THEY
366 dress in L.A. Psycho style.
367 In B.B. daily life is fair and orderly except for the homicidal maniacs who
368 are about to End the World. The hero is brilliant and brave and kind and
369 musical. He wears imaginative clothes that have enormous shoulders or look
370 like they've been run over by trucks.  He works tirelessly for justice,
371 
372 technical excellence, and rock & roll.  The villains are brilliant, too, 
373 but they are dedicated to BADNESS. (That's why they call them bad guys.)
374 They want to oppress the whole universe and are not at all funny or musi-
375 cal.  They wear disguises so you can't tell what their taste in clothes is
376 but you CAN tell they are sneaky and coldly violent.  So the hero SAVES
377 THE WORLD from these fiends. Then he goes backto being heroic.
378 Morality-wise, Repo Man is like Candide as told by John Calvin.  B.B. is
379 like Marvel Comics as told by John Wayne.
380 Buckaroo Banzai has better special effects.

389 We have to stop him from doing that, everybody and there grandmothers know
390 that he works for the NSA, so why does he flash that dumb FBI badge all
391 the time? I ran back the capture tapes of his "secret" radio transmission
392 with HQ, he kept talking about how prettily the stars were shineing today.
393 I think we should definatly not get any cash from Kendall, the observatory
394 is too hot.
395 I tried getting more info from SALOG, no dice, his bodyguard was stoned 
396 again, wouldn't let me talk to him. I think its going to be the Neo-nazi's
397  in Idaho, this looks like far too much firepower for the Rajneeshe run.
398 And if were doing that, we will need the black van. So lets }ake another 
399 payment on the van O.K.??  Get that thing out of the shop.

402 Mikey: I vote for REMOVING the headers, keeping as many ctrl chars as possible
403 (that msg on what is NOW "drive c" would disappear without ctrl chars!)
404 & keeping line numbers.
405    I want to keep line #s because with all the format conversions we are
406 occasoinally going to trash a line. If it hadn't been for line #s, I would have
407 missed several errors ithat have crept in along the way.
408 (considering the way SOME people write, it's hard to tell if part of a line
409 is missing unless there isn't a line number. ie that disk [mar84 maybe?] that
410 had block get "munched" in the xmodem xfer.)
411     ....must go, it's getting early & I'm starting to babble..

416   I am going far away for a few days, and traversing my way to Spokanne, Washington. I plan to be back on Monday morn.
417   Some freind is getting me in, and he claims that the Chairman hes neo-nazi AFFILIATIONS. Only problem being how boring the
418 Society is to non-vintners...
419   I have a plane to catch so I can't say much now, but i will when I get back. If ever...
420   Those vintners you know, wild parties lasting weeks on end, before ANYONE goes home. Sick, smut in every corner, icky poo!

422   BILL C; Well aside frpm the incredible reversion of a disK back, OR SO, I can not complain any about you preformance.
423   I do however suggest that some of your "enemies" are a bit more adept at social kills than, perhaps, you know.
424   If you behave consistantly, in the mature manner you have now, i'm sure the social ambiant will come toSPECT YOU IN TIME.
425   As for my opinion of you, I have not formed a solid one, as yet...

430 Mikey: I got tired just reading your message about archiving.  Your efforts are appreciated by all. You run a fine 
431 establishment.  Sorry about the disturbed ninnies who force enter only mode.
432 MiG:Speaking of enter only mode, I left out some lines in the above to the 
433 effect that Repo Man ascends to heaven in a Chevy Malibu but not because
434 he deserves it. Through grace. Hence the calvinism.  The article is from

438 and culture across the face of managerial inertia ( a face vastly improved 
439 by any change whatsoever, but one notorious for its imperviousness to

442 ting a feast of revolutionary tools and information and prompting such
443 comments as "Is there any more coffee?" and "Why would you want to commu-

470       The apprentice stopped by the Inn but briefly. He had been very busy of
471 late. After finishing his meal (you can all guess what kind of spread the
472 Inn has available on Thanksgiving!), he left a scroll for d, Pam, and his
473 other fiends with the innkeeper.
474 ...............................................
475 (herewith follows the text of the scroll)
476           1 gallon of apple cider
477           1/2 package brown sugar
478           3-4 tbsp whole allspice
479           3-4 tbsp whole cloves
480           6-8 cinnamon sticks (broken)
481           1/2 tsp salt
482           1 jar small spiced crab apples (optional)
483 
484           combine ingerients and boil 1 hour.
485 (WARNING: remove the spices after boiling. If they are left in the cider will
486 get EXTREMELY strong. We did NOT remove the spices the first time we used this
487 recipe and after a couple hours of being kept warm on the stove, the cider
488 was so dark it resembled COFFEE! We finally had to mix the remaining cider
489 with unspiced cider (1:1 to 1:2 proportions) to render it drinkable once more!)

497 aH...Hood River...The city of my origin. So how is the old town anyway? As for the archive disks, unless I have the
498 exact information of these new 5" disks, including skew patterns and such, I can't use them. Double sided stuff is
499 bad enough, if it's not something popular like Xerox or Osbug 1, and your format sounds ultra strange.
500 Milchar : Color? Finally! Outstanding. Now you can see the famous L'homme/Milch line. plot, and fill routines run out
501 of stack space in living color. One note on the adventure. Get your compass fixed. I was careful to mention the citadel
502 was to the east, while you spoke of looking west. What gives? Too much kool-aid? Any word on the koala program?
503 Voyeur : You made an entry. Another Omen must have come in the mail. heh heh. Seriously though, how was your
504 Thanksgiving dinner? I suppose the ENTIRE family was there...sigh...(sorry leonard)
505 Mikey again: What do you know about rectifiers? I was helping a friend finish up his LNW computer kit, but when we
506 tested the power supply, I got some STRANGE readings. The +/- 12 were there ok, as well as -5, but no +5. The windings
507 off the xformer gave the rectifier 9vac, which is right, but coming out of the rectifier was +7.5 vdc, instead of 5.
508 If you see a pattern, let me know. I can tell you more about what I found on various test points on the board later.
509 And last but not least...Kathy...Your adventure helper is here. The treasures you must find are GOLD NUGGET, SILVER 
510 BARS, JEWELRY, COINS, DIAMONDS, MING VASE, PEARL, EMERALD, PLATINUM, CHAIN, SPICES, PERSIAN RUG, AND TREASURE CHEST.
511 ok...From west end of 'The Hall of Mists.' W,D,N,E,(ORANGE COLUMN PIT),E,NW. OK, this is where the pirate hides his

520 
521         Why if it isn't thy sister's keeper. Normally I don't reply to
522 comments, especially if they are as feebly worded as yours, but I will
523 make an exception in this case.
524 
525         These are the words my equipment found problems with.
526 
527         word       /  correct spelling
528         ----          ----------------
529         murmer    /   murmur
530         humour    /   humor
531         collegue  /   colleague
532         savoury   /   savory
533         medly     /   medley
534         cauldren  /   caldron
535 
536         And according to Webster's 20th century 2nd edition Unabridged
537 dictionary, there is no such word as 'blousy.'
538 
539         If a message is to have English (British) spelling contained in it,
540 the entire message should be written as such. Dropping such words out of
541 context is considered tacky and pompous. Nevertheless, my equipment obviously
542 did not count all of the errors.
543 
544         In closing, you take all of this far too seriously. This is merely
545 an attempt to raise consciousnesses, not ires. If you can't take it in the vein
546 it was meant, then you have problems indeed.
547 
548         By the way, you misspelled 'nonexistant' / nonexistent.
549 
550 SPELL ALERT SPELL ALERT SPELL ALERT SPELL ALERT SPELL ALERT SPELL ALERT SPELL
551 
552 
553 SPELL ALERT, I'm afraid that your equipment is faulty on a few of those.  Humour and Savour are both acceptable
554 alternative spellings, and Cauldron (spelled "on" and not "en") is also an acceptable variation.  Check your Webster's,
555 you'll find them listed.  Otherwise.......  who cares?  I agree that this is a great fuss about nothing.
556 As to "tacky and pompous", when I was first learning to spell (some 40 years ago), "colour", "flavour", and so forth
557 were as common in this country as the versions you find more acceptable.  It is extremely "pompous" of Americans to take
558 a word, change it's spelling to suit our needs, and then refer to the original (and some would say correct) spelling as
559 a "chiefly British variation".  Those spellings are the original ones, and our spellings are the variations.  Or perhaps
560 bastardizations would be a better description.  Of course, Americans are an arrogant lot.
561 ........................................................................................................................
562 SPELL ALERT: Also please note that the "British" spellings are the STANDARD
563 spellings in Canada! Anyone who has lived there a while tends to use them
564 interchangeably after they return to the US. 
565 ______________________________________Leonard_________________________________
566 ps L'homme: I need a new IBM version copy of Subadv. I seem to have made
567 ne to many changes to my original... (IBM so that it'll be easier to 
568 convert to M100). 
569 ___________________________________________________________________________
570 
571 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++;;
572 SPELL ALERT: You talk about people being pompous and tacky because
573 they use word variations and spelling you don't like. Yet don't
574 you think what your doing is a bit pompous and tacky? As for
575 a word not appearing in your dictionary, that hardly makes it
576 wrong to use it. There are many words that don't appear in the
577 dictionary. It is one of the beautiful things about the English
578 language, you can create words to more closely fit what you are
579 trying to say. I enjoy seeing the creation of a new word. It shows
580 that the person is actually thinking about what they are writing,
581 and not getting all wrapped up in what is proper and what isn't.
582 The way words get in the dictionary is that they are created by
583 people who use them, and when they become commonly accepted, then
584 the dictionary folks decide it's time to accept it as existing.
585 I also disagree that it is not proper to use old english spelling
586 in or out of context. It is only important that the spelling be
587 consistant so that it is readable. And as for d's message, you
588 obviously didn't read it, else you wouldn't have made the comment
589 to begin with. It most certainly was written with an old english
590 flavour. And in fact, the particular spelling and words used enhanced
591 the mood and tone of the writting. That is the important thing, words
592 should be used to create the picture, not to be important of themselves.

596 ***********************************************************:
597 L'homme: +7.5 vdc coming out of the rectifier sounds about right
598 (maybe it could be a little more. It should be feed to a 5 volt
599 regulator someplace to get the +5 regulated. The normal cause
600 of loss of +5 is a short someplace.

605      I come to the Inn, but it appears that nobody is home.  On this day
606 after Thanksgiving I would have thought that the Innkeeper would be here for
607 me to speak to, but it appears that he is not.  Perhaps I will try again
608 this weekend.  I wanted to tell him of the tables I cleaned, of the closet I
609 opened wherein lay the simple tools of the barkeep's trade, and of how I was
610 unable to once again close the door after it was opened.  Apparently I was
611 using the wrong key, or perhaps using the key incorrectly.  Ah well, such is
612 life for those of us whose experience is only matched by our ignorance in
613 the ways of these infernal devices!
614 
615      As I clean this table I wonder at the deep marks that have been scored
616 across it's oaken surface.  It seems that one patron has lifted his voice in
617 criticism of others, and another has jumped to his feet in chivalrous
618 defense of the Lady D's honour (honor?  I too was taught to spell it that
619 way, and though I know the forms accepted in this country, I often find
620 myself returning to the ways of my youth).  Gentlemen, please!  Sometimes
621 the best way to take such commentary is merely to ignore it if you find it
622 overly bothersome.  I'm sure my friend D understands.  And Sir Alert, you
623 say that your remarks should be taken in the vein they were meant, but I
624 find that the vein was not clearly defined.  Your original message told of
625 errors and mistakes, but since it wasn't specific as to what they were, the
626 tone came across as derogatory rather than constructive.  Perhaps future
627 commentary should give the incorrect words, rather than the pointing finger.
