24 Piper:I'll try again. The last time I called your home # I think I was routed through Zanzibar, and at last ended up
25 talking to a night-time operator at Tek.
26 To 'female' L. Ryan : Your personal appearance was as unfathomable as we have now come to expect. One would think the
27 underground, that trod-upon organization of sodbusters could afford better people. But I guess this is a case of beggers
28 not affording to be choosers.
29 ()()()() : It has been stated before, but I'll add a bit anyway. You have missed much of the groundwork that has been
30 laid by these characters. This groundwork has been met with less than enthusiastic response. Joshua and I used to have long
31 talks about our motivations and goals, but people in our own organization and the enemie's complained there wasn't enough
32 action, it didn't further the story along enough, no violence, espionage, or sex, etc. Disheartening at best, wouldn't you
33 agree? The crowd at the Inn at that time had a short attention span, and a need for continuous open stimulation. Maybe 
34 things have migrated enough now to attempt such personal revelations again. Let's see what happens.

36 	"This way", L'homme motioned Farley into the foyer of Ione Plaza. A strange mix of elderly patrons and younger
37 trendies made up the current occupants of the Plaza. #Strange place.#, Farley thought. #I don't know whether to hum
38 Duke Elington or Devo.# The trio stepped into the nearest elevator, that had conviently arrived the moment when L'homme 
39 pressed the button by the door. "Inside, and be quick about it". Fellows pressed the CLOSE DOOR button on a panel, that
40 was surprisingly lacking any floor buttons. "One destination only, if that's what you were thinking." A sudden surge put
41 the three's collective stomachs in the three's collective throats. "High speed elevators...Another NET innovation", Fellows
42 gasped. A few moments later, the doors slid apart, revealing a normal looking office beyond. #I can't remember if we went up
43 or down! I'll have to ask them about that later# Farley mused. A plain looking receptionist pointed towards an inner office,
44 and a door, seemingly without help, opened by itself. "This is it" L'homme told Farley. "You are about to meet the head
45 of our little organization. Our guiding light, and our inspiration. You are about to meet Ian MacHinery!" The men went in,
46 and again, the door closed by itself, with a resounding 'thud.'

51   (Magen & Raza are still on the beach...the first rays of the warm tropical
52    sunset are reaching toward that long line separating sea and sky, soon
53    they will grab the edge of the world and pull the sun over the horizon.)
54 
55   "Magen, the power plant is perfectly harmless. This stuff about it causing
56 changes inside peoples' heads is nonsense. Look at the good things we have
57 because of it. The whole town is lit up at night, just like in the day. It
58 gives people twice as much time to do things."
59   "Do what kind of things? Sit on a quiet beach and look at the stars?"
60   "Of course not. You can't see the stars with the lights on. I'm talking
61 about the shops staying open. There's even a Disco opening tonight. How
62 about television? Over three hundred people have one now; there's even a
63 cable all the way up to the top of the hill up there."
64   "I know."
65   "What's that supposed to mean?"
66   "I sat out here on the beach the other night, looking at the stars for a
67 long time. Then I looked at the hill. There were the houses up there with all
68 the people inside. I could see an occasional silhouette moving around in the
69 flickering glow of the television; like the shadow people we used to make on
70 the sand in the moonlight. All of a sudden I thought..."
71   "Well go on."
72   "I thought of the beauty of the night sky. Its velvet black covered with
73 thousands of stars. I knew that if this lovely spectacle only happened once
74 in a lifetime, or once in hundreds of years, the beach would be crowded with
75 people trying to get a glimpse of it. Because it happens every night there
76 are some people who will never see it."

78   |_|_|_|_| & Mark---Thank you again for your support. I'm happy to say most
79 of the people I've met out here (in person and via computer) have been kind
80 and pleasant. I decided to take the advice of that philosopher who said:

85 MELISSA: I hate grudges, glad you returned.
86 BRUTUS: I will explain my view, perhaps it is unnecassary now that Melissa has 
87 returned, perhaps I will regret doing it later... for now...
88     My borders, |_|_|_|, are the bars of my cage. I am caged because I can not 
89 write. I can only enjoy the stories of others. I am a writer; I am caged. 
90     I try to complement the stories of the new writer's because I enjoy them 
91 and because I feel they need support. However, I, myself, am new. I only know 
92 the other new comers if they tell me. I enjoy ALL the stories at the Inn (ex-
93 cluding Policeman's). I do not compliment them all, but I enjoy them all...
94 I attacked you harshly because I thought you to be an assassin, out to destroy
95 writers. I was afraid you hurt Melissa. My name is Tanya. A person by the name
96 of Jay Anderson was harsh in critical words, consequently I do little writing.
97 (Yes, I am beginning to regret this, so much for enter only). Jay's attack 
98 hurt me, I did not defend myself, I quit writing. It pained me to think that 
99 you had done this uncarring thing to another. (I can not express this pain).  
100 When I attacked you, I thought you to be an assassin. I thought you how I view
101 Jay, uncarring: attack and kill. I was scared that Melissa would be effected 
102 like I am. 
103     I can not tell through your anger, if I have cut you deeply. I hope not.
104 I thought you to be an assassin. I did not think that you had feelings like the
105 assassin's victim. Under a different identity, I expressed how I felt, in 
106 defence of another. I am sorry if I have caused you any pain. Shamefully, I bow
107 my head and ask for your forgivence. enjaulado en sombras. -Tanya

110   words fail me... none of them are proper... at this moment anyway... a silioquy for a departed

121 PAM: What can I say? A very moving and loving epitaph.
122 I know it may seem trite, but I know how you feel, it 
123 was only a year ago that my grandmother passed on. How
124 can one express depth of love and sorrow when someone
125 so close has gone. I'm truly sorry to hear of your loss.

129   Although many people do not make it a point to complement everything they read, most enjoy the writing anyway.
130   It is possible that someone did not like your writing and did not respond, but at the same time, it is possible someone did
131 liked it and did not respond.
132   In any case, I think it is very good of you to open yourself to the patrons, a first step in friendship is usually what is
133 called for lack of a better phrase, an 'opening line'.

201       May you always remember your grandmother with happy thoughts and
202       fond memories.

204          upon them at a later date.  May your experiences be full and

210   Sorrell dropped the bulky frame of the flame throwerr, barely avoiding getting caught in the framework of the tanks.
211    Drawing his pistol, Sorrell edged slowly backward, firing for cover as he and the others retreated cautiously.
212 
213   Sorrell listened to his head set and masked out the outside noise using his Net training. Still, after losing most of the
214 words to the noise, a few keywords became noticable.
215   "Police en route here, clean it all up" With intermittant crackles "Transmitter area data loaded on the copter. Outa there,
216 we have what we want!"
217 
218   Sorrell looked over to Omega, and caught his shining panic stricken eyes. Omega had listened too, and they both knew what
219 ought to be done.
220   Omega quickly rolled for cover under an overturned piano, which immediately peirced with automatic fire.
221 
222   Sorrell nodded and they both split off, each leaping for a seperate stairway, hoping to confuse the enemy agents as much as
223 possible for an instant.
224   Sorrell felt the nick of a bullet on hhis heel, no wounding though, it was only a niick.
225 
226   Omega was bounding down his set of stairs, leaping four at a time. As he landed on the last flight he turned to see an enemy
227 agent bearing down on him.
228   Omega used his forward momentum to continue his leap through another archway and into another room. Where he landed hard,
229 and on the cold cement.
230 
231   Omega strugled to his feet, sickened at the slowness of his abused muscles. He dodged through another archway in time to
232 avoid another set of bullets.
233 
234   Omega saw Sorrell appear at the opposite end of the corridor stacked to one side with communications equipment.  Several
235 green enemy were in their line of fire, and seemed confused with the prospect of nothing to seek cover under.
236 
237   Omega jerked hard at the hesitant cold of his trigger. Saw several people bend at the joints where the most weight resided.
238   Sorrell saw this too and regretted half heartedly his decision not to fire. Omega was aiming his weapon at him.
239 
240   Omega glared at Sorrell, not realizing it was all over now. In the instant he might have fired, Omega thought about the face
241 and in trying to identify it with enemy agents he knew, the name Sorrell appeared in his mind. And for a second, Omega thought
242 him a traitor. Then Omega realized where he was and who he was.
243 
244   Sorrell still glared at Omega as he stepped to one side of the door and peeked over the side, looking for trouble.
245   Sorrell perceived two Net agents walking down the hall, obviously as shocked as Omega.
246 
247   Omega retreived his hand from inside the locked bin, and shouted aloud "They got the code book!" which was picked up and was
248 cried in turn by five voices.

251 
252     EXCERPTED FROM A NET BREIFING DOCUMENT DATED JANUARY 26, 1985 AT 0425 PM
253     "It was later discovered that the Code Book had been spirited away by agent L'Homme and was later returned to the new safe
254 house organized eight hours later in a North Portland house boat at an unspecified address."
255     "It was also later discovered that the Information stolen by the follower fanatics of Bhagwan Sri Dangerfield was instead
256 the transcript tapes of all out going communications in the last three months, which were not destroyed in time to prevent
257 their capture."
258 
259     "It is for this reason that I suggest the phased replacement of all the old codes in favor of their new ciphers."
260     "When that many of our communications are intercepted at one time, it is most dangerous to forget the pssibility that our
261 computers may have been in error when they deemed them at the highest difficulty of deciphering of all known agencies."

264      There really are not too many places where one can sit down to get a roast
265 sirloin of beef between two and three o'clock in the morning, but I knw of one.
266 It doesn't take much to make yourself eat when you are about to arrive on the 
267 brink of exhaustion, it just comes naturally; chew, chew, chew, chew... Exhaus-
268 tion for some comes from having done a great deal, for others it is caused by
269 having to wait for a tsak to be performed. When it comes to the latter, the 
270 former has a way of sneaking in all of a sudden. 
271 Example:    Gee, it sure isn't very busy right now...  (pause)
272  (pause)    Damn, it sure is busy right now!      (pant, pant)
273      Besides, making time for such a diversion gave me a little more time to
274 consider the possible directions that my pencil and keyboard will soon venture.
275 And if nothing else, it ensures that I will be able to walk into this INN with
276 less dificulty at this wee hour in the mornin'. There was only one problem,
277 the considerations I had made did not come to any definite conclusions. 
278      I have, though, decided to give way wit at least partial entries to get me 
279 back on the proper tracks. I do not include this as one, for it is only a minor
280 disertaion and not an attachment to one of my storylines. (which is just too
281 bad, 'cause it's saying just what I want it to say...  minus errors/typos)
282      As I take the last bite of meat, I then think of those I have met recently
283 and of my habit of considering others Friends before they tend to feel likewise.
284 These Friends will not leave my mind, and I do not let it distract for one 
285 single bit-  it adds 'flavor' to my meal. 
286      With the meal at an end and the cost counted, I now trek home with the
287 clouds of my breate as a fading marker of where it is that I have been. If I do
288 not now make use of the thoughts in my mind, they will be as the clouds left
289 behind me- gone forever, never seen  nor rememeberd.

291 kathy:     ?  Always.
292 PAM:     The grief I have felt three times before swells in my throat as I come

299     The practitioner looked at the document that marked the passing of the
300 year and noticed that the second of the divisions called months was about to
301 begin very soon. Why this is the month of 'hearts and flowers' he thought to
302 himself. Addressing the assembled throng he said:
303     Friends of the Inn, I have a proposal for a interesting experiment in
304 human interaction and communication. Why don't we proclaim the next month as
305 the month of  the "FRIENDLY ENCOUNTER". You might well ask what that means.
306     The proposal is that everyone try to make all their communication in a
307 friendly manner. Be creative. Try to avoid the confrontational mode of
308 interaction. Limit disagreement to 'damn them with faint praise' types of
309 statements. It might even stimulate new ideas of how to express certain kinds
310 of feelings.
311     What better way to celebrate the month?
312     HAPPY VALENTINE! to all of you. (early)

315   I, for one, would like to second the alcheemist's motion!   The last disk
316 and the first part of this one will remain in memory for a long, long time.
317   L'Homme -- please try again.  I come and go at work... try at random, as
318 my schedule is pseudo-random.
319   Melissa -- Welcome back.  I missed your story while you were gone.  One of
320 the things I have noticed over several years both in lurk and active voice,
321 the general tenor of the entries changes with the expression of the preferencees
322 of the rest of the contributers.  If you don't like something, say it, but
323 pleasee be sepecific about what you don't like.  We all seem to have rather
324 thin skins when it comes to our writing -- after all these constructions of
325 ideas and words are our mental children!

329 Tanya---It was your kind and gentle hand that helped me to return and continue
330   writing. Please do me the honor of accepting my hand in the same kind of
331   friendship. I can tell by the way you express yourself that indeed there is
332   a writer inside you that wants out. Actually that writer has already escaped
333   from the cage. Give your heart wings and let the stories roll off your
334   finger tips. When a person is sensitive and open brutal words do hurt. You
335   helped me to set aside the pain and continue with my story. Please, let me
336   encourage you to do likewise. You can write! Let us share it!

340 I've told you a million times not to exaggerate!
341      ou seemed to have done an encore, "repeating the same." (Line 250)
342         How else under the milky way can you repeat?
343             Also, "redundancy" is already "excess"ive.
344 If you will not mend your ways: I'm going to recommend an award to you from
345     the Oregon chapter of the Unicorn Hunter.

398 PAM: I lost my grandma early this January. I felt lucky that I had the chance to get to know her again. I have not yet 
399 totaly mentaly matured, but I knew that it was coming. Your passage really touched my heart.

403 One called Brutus-   I wait for your response. Please reply, no matter what the
404 content. Give me some sign of recognition, at least. Please...
405 Lurkers- don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't please
406 All- Thank you. As I read the messages writtien here, to me and to others, I am
407 overcome with a sence of happiness, a feeling I like the words for, I can only
408 (that "like" above is "lack") call it something beyond the range of "good",
409 it tips somewhere, without any direction near "bad". I look apon the patrons at
410 the Inn and I doubt I will regret stepping from these torturing bars, and 
411 pushing back the hood of my cloak. Thank you.   Amor, Tanya

413 From Tanya:
414 Below I shall write a poem. Before I do, I must explain something about the
415 poem. It is written on two levels. The first is an attack, in which the poem
416 attacks what it parellels. The second level can only be found, beyond the first
417 it is deeper and more personal, I think. Often times, poems are written with 
418 many levels, however, even the first is frequently unnoticed. Normally, I 
419 would not explain such things, but I found need to. A few have expressed their
420 dislike for poems, perhaps this is because they do not see these levels. 
421 Perhaps not.   The poem goes unnamed. If you wish to, name it.

423 the rain falls softly on the lake
424 one droplet progresses outward in a ring
425 it surfaces across the water
426 to human eye, it fades and becomes a part of the lake
427 continously, the ripples extend to the entire pool
428 the carcass of a fish lies corroding along the bank
429 its unprotective armor does not glisten in the light
430 moss and algae grow toward the center of the lake
431 they blanket the water, in after-thought of death
432 lifeless, falls this peace of world, peice of foundation
433 no bird sings of this collapsed ecosystem
434 the song of winged is lost in the demise
435 the atmosphere covers the quiteness
436 one sound can be heard through the silence
437 it is the gently falling rain

440         Ian blanked the display and looked up as the trio entered. "So 
441 you are the 'Farley', I 
442                        A've been hearing so much about..."
443         Thus began Farley's "de-briefing".
444 ..... some time later....
445         The terminal beeped. Ian glanced at the display. "Well, I think
446 that about takes care of things here. They've located 'Fred', he was 
447 blocked-in by a fire engine. He appears to be alright, at least judging
448 from the ruckus he kicked up when the pick-up crew loaded him into the
449 trailer."
450         "Your FIRST assignment is to go down to the lab's garage and
451 calm him down! We are going to want to examine him VERY carefully. We
452 try to keep up with everyone's progress in AI, but he's the only sample
453 of anything that advanced to come our way. Other than our OWN, of
454 course."
455       At Farley's panic-striken look, he added, "Don't worry, we aren't
456 going to hurt him. But SOMEBODY has to be able to do maintenance on him,
457 and I doubt that the people you got him from would welcome you back."
458        "After that, Fellows will take you down to 'Personnel'. I think
459 we can trust you with a level 3 clearance. Once that's out of the way
460 you 'll be assigned to help Fellows and Parity look for another missing
461 agent."
462       "Fellows, be sure the's issued bankcards and a phone credit card.
463 Give him the SHORT breifing on using them to make emergency reports. He
464 is going to have to wait for a proper briefing til things slow down a
465 little."
466         "Well? why are you still standing there?! I've got work to do!
467 AND SO DO YOU!!"

469 just in case it wasn't clear: Fred was loaded onto a CLOSED trailer (as

474 within it, but I'm not sure. Please write some more, you are off to a 
475 really good start. But what was that message to lurkers? Anyway, please
476 continue, you are off to a really great start.
477     Good week - A great idea! Was it a week or a month? It should be a 
478 whole year it's such a good idea.
479           Pam - I can feel your loss, it must hurt. But as another Inn
480 member said, she would want you to live a happy life. It's hard to 
481 forget the past, use it for yourself and not against you. I'm not making
482 much sence here, I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. I feel,
483 it's hard to forget the past, but don't forget the present.

487   Omega stepped over the cord railing, afraid of falling into the black waters, but even more afraid to let anyone notice.
488   Sorrell was walking the long way around all the walkways, and was giggling to himself at the odd way Omega was twisting in
489 order to aviod the ropes and the water.
490 
491   Sorrell stepped under the doorway, which was little low, even for his height. Omega had to fully bend to avoid the cieling.
492   Omega followed him, simulatig his movements exactly. And followed him to the marked door.
493 
494   Sorrell turned the knob and pulled wide the door, after letting his eyes get used to the low lihting and the blinking of odd
495 lights in weird places, he dicked under the doorway.
496   Omega entered withot letting his eyes adjust, and would be sorry for that later.

517 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
518 Now to remind everyone of MY F*A*V*O*R*I*T*E subject.  The above
519 entry wins the Smurf award for space waste.
520 You walked into the Inn without ever checking for traps?  Ok, that's
521 it.  Put your dice away, THAT's IT.  It's over.
522 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ nicer note
523 ALL NEWCOMERS:  I am the space waste watcher of the INN (one of them), and
524 we would like to remind you that before you get into anything to far
525 and do not know how to get out, you are in trouble. This is very true
526 with LIFE in general.  If you get yourself tofar into trouble without
527 even thinking of 'How I am going to get out of this mess' then you are
528 going to wind up in deep *#%$ someday.  Now if only I knew Mikeys
529 phone number, ENTER ONLY, oh, well.  But at this hour you say?  Forget
530 it, he would probably just unplug us all until morning.  What time
531 is it anyway?   Just say 2 o'clock, its 1:58 really.   Ok.
532 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
533 PAM:  sure hope that you have made it back to the Inn to see the
534 bulletin board full of sympathy notes.  I think mark was refering to
535 me, what a nice thought, to be mentioned by a passing .... oh, never mind.
536 (Swish)....................(PoP)    a stirring passage though
537 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
538 Well PaPa is going after some ice-cream he hears scremming for his
539 attention in the kitchen "I'LL BE RIGHT THERE MY SWEET", so it
540 must be time for me to be out of here.   To all,   MERRY CHRISTMAS
541 drat ENTER ONLY ... your time of year Pops.  Oh well, I think it
542 is past PaPas bedtime anyway.
543 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A tired PaPa Smurf
544 Command relenquished...  Command accepted, sir. Thank you...
545 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     ("always opinions..."  C.C.)
546 It is rather hilarious to keep The Smurf off his guard by doing the unexpected... Such as reciting items from an old AD&D
547 game ("...that's it. put away the dice...") and by carrying my infamous Bag of Holding. This Bag of Holding has only been
548 seen by a score of people or so, but the ammount of its contents may at times be likened to the ability of a woman to stuff
549 her purse to the seams with nothing but the non-essentials. Such is my Bag. Although filled with the non-essentials, it is
550 really amazing that I get away with carrying around as I have (:: 60 lbs?). But why do I find it neccessary to carry around
551 fifteen minutes of film with me? Or a towel...  never mind, I just remembered why
552 it is so important to carry my towel.  But 120 feet of rope and gear? I must be a tad loony... (No- tad not Tad...)
553 I guess that I'm just babbling on. Does it make any sense? Will it end? Should it end? And why do I call myself
554 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     --->the Guardian     29:02
555 Relenquishing command, sir...

558      The Inn is in a very interresting state right now. plenty of new writers
559 and idea's. Let's wait and see what transpires in the next couple of weeks.

561      The car pulled in the drive marked "emergency" and Marci helped the
562 attendants with Jack. He had regained his senses and had started to babble
563 about the Sea First Accounts when Tony quickly covered his mouth. A big
564 mistake on Tony's part as Jack firmly planted his teeth into Tony's palm.
565 IEEEE the attendants removed Jacks grip and helped Tony to wash a bandage
566 his hand. <yuk> 
567     Tina and Marci were taking care of Jacks admittance and were trying
568 to come up with a good reason for a bullet hole.
