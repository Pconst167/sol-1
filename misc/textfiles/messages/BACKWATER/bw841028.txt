21 Wow!  First time at the top...unfortunately I don't have too much to say.
22 Well, I haven't had anyone call Rome since my last appeal.  I realize that it's
23 nothing like BWMS and alot of people would gladly spit on a networks board if
24 they had the chance, but if you wouldn't, please call Rome.  I find the quali-
25 ty of messages on Backwater first rate, and I like to have that kind of input
26 on Rome.  Well, this may be the last time I'm ever at the top, so I'm savouring
27 this moment, but I've got to go, so see ya.

31 L'HOMME: I WILL SEE YOU AT THE NEXT PCS SOC. ?  P.S. I HAVE THE LAST 3
32 DISKS OF THE AARON PACKAGE FULL OF BWMS WHICH WILL BE THERE AS WELL.
33 OH NO! NOT ANOTHER $12.00! LET'S SEE, THAT WOULD MAKE IT $160. GEE, ONLY
34 ANOTHER $75-$100 TO GET A NEW MODEM FOR BWMS.
35 LEONARD: ALSO I WILL HAVE (GASP!) THE BW LISTINGS THERE FOR YOU TO SEE 
36 IF YOU WANT. (YES, I FOUND THEM UNDER AN OLD PILE OF MAGS. LORD ONLY KNOWS
37 HOW THEY MIGRATED TO THERE.) ALSO, ABOUT THE BACKSPACE THING REMEMBER
38 THAT FOR EVERY BACKSPACE YOU SEND, BW DOES BS/SP/BS TO ERASE THE CHARACTER
39 THUS IT RETURNS 3 CHARS FOR EVERY ONE OF YOURS. THUS THERE IS A TIMING
40 PROBLEM IF YOU TRY TO FEED THEM TOO FAST TO BW. (IT JUST IGNORES ANY EXTRAS
41 THAT IT CAN'T PICKUP WHILE DOING ITS THING.) AND OF COURSE YOU ARE AWARE OF
42 THE PROBLEM IN REGARD TO CONTROL CHARACTER ON/OFF WHEN DOING BACKSPACES.
43 MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER DROPPING THE CONTROL CHARACTER ASPECT (MAYBE ALLOW
44 A FEW PREDEFINED CONTROL CHARS? BUT THEN IF YOU ALLOW ONE THEN YOU MIGHT
45 AS WELL ALLOW THEM ALL. OH WELL, SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.)
46 P.S. I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN ON TO COMPUSERVE FOR REAL, THEY HAVE WEIRD
47 BILLING IDEAS, AND I HAVE TO GET THAT SETTLED BEFORE I CAN GO ANY 
48 FURTHER. SIGH.. AT LEAST THE H150 WORKS.. WELL SORT OF.. IT SEEMS THEY
49 LEFT OUT THE PARTS FOR THE SECOND SERIAL PORT. SIGH... FRUSTRATING.....

52 CISTOP MIKEY; It is apparent to me that you are avoiding the issue, and making excuses for not deciding.
53   All said and done, there still remains that there is a President to be chosen and you are trying to evade a decision.
54   By voting for None of the Above, you ware avoiding the issue almost exactly like someone who does not even enter a vote.
55   Neither helping nor hindering, simply sitting in an armchair claiming high morals, and lofty ideas.
56   On a side note, this practice is reminiscent of El Salvadorian rebels that kill hundreds preventing the populace from voting
57 and then claim that they are 'Fighting for Change'. Inconsistant?

62   Sigh... I just can't seem to keep my mouth shut....
63   To the above person...  One of the major problems with US politics is that
64 we have no viable independent political parties.  We have two monolithic
65 machines that blunder through the business of government and insulate our
66 politicians from any real-world concerns.  What real difference is this from
67 a country that has a single monolithic machine that brooks no opposition?
68 A small, but important point is that it allows the "outs" to become "ins" if
69 they can find abuses by the present "ins."  Beyond that, the very monolithic 
70 structure of the two-party system is a very effective muffler of dissent.  By
71 the time a politico can run for office, he is so indebted to the machinery that
72 he/she is morally incompetent to hold that office.  Countries in which the
73 political spectrum is more varied, such as France, or our neighbor to the north,
74 Canada, have a much larger variety of political parties.  It is much easier to
75 find others of like mind and work towards a change.  The number of persons
76 that refuse to be affiliated with either of the two monolithic parties is 
77 increasing, even in Oregon where you are penalized during the primary..  I'm 
78 sure that they're both a little nervous about some charismatic leader coming
79 along and forming a viable third party.  I'm also sure that if that did appear
80 to be happening that Measures Would Be Taken and The Situation Would Be Corrected.
81 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
82   The piper, his awful hunger calmed, looked carefully as Milchar talked to
83 his aqueous guest.  Oh well, a talking pond was not too bad, he could think of
84 worse things.  Muttering to himself, the piper thought aloud...
85   "Red and green...  with blue, these are the additive primary colors... hmm...
86 three primarys added together make white... that doesn't quite sound right,
87 somehow.  Red and green are complimentary colors in the subtractive system...
88 no, we get into triplets rather than fours any associations I can make with
89 colors...."  The piper stared into the middle distance, thinking.

119 Well, I try not to bend my sacred rule of two endorsements.  As I said before,
120 The Piper and Friar Tuck are citizens, and if you call other boards besides
121 BWMS, there's even more of a chance that people will be able to endorse you.  I
122 know that the endorsement system isn't the best in the world, but please hang
123 in there.  If we can get a few BWMS people on Rome, the process will be much
124 easier for everyone else.

170 Mikey: THANK YOU! Looking at my current attempts at the I/O handlers.... 
171 .... well, let's just say I'd be glad to see how someone ELSE did it.
172        I now have my new 8085 assembler. It caught a few minor errors (a couple
173 too embarassing to mention!).  Now I can code & CHECK at work.
174       By the way, am I correct in assuming that I can borrow the listings? If
175 not, how much would you like for Xeroxing them?
176 L'Homme: I wanted to check on a couple of things. One is the PAUG meeting, are
177 you going & can I get a ride?

185 Mikey:   You mentioned something about a "new modem" in some lines above.  Well
186 the cheapest 1200 baud modem is about $230.  I will donate $30 to the cause, 
187 making the cost to BWMS $200.  You don't even need to pay me immediately, and
188 you might ask for donations from 1200 baud users (like Bit Bucket did.)

194 To any one that reads this and is on Rome.   My Name is            and I have
195 asked the sysop to post my name on the "WISHING THEY COULD GET IN" list and
196 so far he hasn't done it.  He claims that he owns a freindly system where he
197 only validates real users.  I know a lot of people and they say that all there
198 is on Rome is trash about what the newest games are and what the most popular
199 group is.  If all the board has to offer is arguing and petty talk about who
200 is tougher than who then why should you have to keep people out.  Why don't
201 you let them all in and you could have one hell of a bash.  A long time ago
202 when the board was called "Swing Shift" I had a validated password.  So did
203 a lot of other people but you deleted them all and now they are waiting so
204 that they can get validated by what is on there now, trash.  Try being nicer
205 to the people that call and your board might have a better name.  It is
206 popular now, but what can you see in a board that only has 8-10 year olds
207 running the thing?

210 Gyre smiled at Bard's request.  "Alas, I cannot show you if you phrase it in that manner.  I must also know the color.
211 WILL tell you", he paused, "that Gold is the fourth and final color."
212 Piper mumbled, "blue...".  The puddle quivered, as if awaiting a special signal.  Using this as a que, Piper said, 
213 "Show us the Blue Power!"
214 Gyre exclaimed, "AT LAST!  My purpose fulfilled!  Come this way, gentlemen!"
215 Gyre suddenly expanded, and grew to the size of a small lake, only 1/2 inch in depth.  The color of the water changed
216 from blue to black... and I stepped in.  I think the others followed.
217 I nearly became sick to my stomach.  The spinning sensation I felt as I fell through a void of some sort came quite 
218 close to making me ill.  It did not last long, however, before I completed the journey...
219 The surroundings had shifted.  We (the others had come through, also) were standing in a large shallow lake, but we
220 were no longer inside the Ruby Valley.  The motif here seemed to be water.  The Valley here could more closely be 
221 described as a lagoon.  The only dry portions were on widely-spread strips of white sand, upon which glittered  small
222 specks of blue... sapphires?  I wasn't sure.
223 A groan to my left made me turn.  L'homme was laying there, breathing slowly.  My God, I had forgotten all about him.
224 Thinking back, I hadn't seen him since the attack on the Gazebo.  He awoke with a start.  "Where... what... why...",
225 sputtered L'homme, unsure of his method of arrival, or ours for that matter.
226 "If you're asking why you're there, and how, I think I have a solution to the 'strange water' mystery.  It comes from
227 here.  It seems to be semi-sentient, and can track a hurt person to cure him with its healing properties.  I would 
228 venture to guess that you were hurt in the attack and Gyre brought you here, L'homme.", Bard said.
229 "Now what?  We look for a Blue necklace?  Then a Gold one?  THEN what happens?  Do we get the jackpot?", I asked 
230 everyone, almost as puzzled as before, but not quite.
231 "Better yet, HOW DO WE LEAVE?", Piper added.
232 "How about someone helping me up?", L'homme asked.
233 "Here.  I am anxious for more answers.", I said, and helped him up.  "Let us continue.  Which direction?"
234 "Try the nearest beach, and work your way from there.", the Friar piped in.
235 "On we go then!", we all cried in unison.  Stunned, we laughed at our common thought.

242 What with politics dominating the scene, the laughter and normally lively
243 conversation had dwindled to a trickle. Light speculation and heavy drinking
244 soon drove the mathematician to seek relief. Looking up at the far wall he
245 noticed a small sign, carefully designed, in exquisite gold letters:
246 
247     ----------------------------
248    |  Why worry about TOMORROW, |
249    |  when today is so far off? |
250     ----------------------------
251 
252 Now that at least makes sense, he thought to himself. The graffito on the
253 near wall was much more cryptic:
254 
255         DOC HID DICE ---- CHECK BOX BED
256 
257 Probably some secret spy message, he mused. Then he noticed that it read the
258 same when viewed in the mirror. How odd, mirrors are supposed to reverse
259 things, the message should have been unreadable. Maybe there was more going
260 on here than meets the eye!

263   MM -- that's very strange.  I don't remember any mirrors on the floor or
264 ceiling at the inn... or was the grafitti on the wall?  In fact, I though

270 Sitting on the sand, I let it run through my fingers.  I leaned out a bit to get
271 some more sand.  "Look at your robe !", exclaimed Lila, "It is not worn out on the
272 elbows any more."  I jumped up and noticed that the places that had touched the 
273 sand were all repaired and made as good as new.  "Fascinating.", said I, "Do you
274 suppose that it will fix other things as well?"  I removed all of the items from
275 my pockets and poured handfuls of the amazing sand over them.  All of them were
276 quickly returned to a better than new condition.  "Amazing !  If you will turn your
277 back, Lila, I will fix up the rest of my robe."  She turned away in deference to my
278 modesty, and I quickly doffed my robe and let the sand do its magic on the robe.
279 Slipping it back on, I noticed that it was softer, as well as stronger and of more
280 vibrant brown than it had evrer been new.
281 "If you like, Lila, we will wait for you to repair all of your clothing as well."
282 "Thank you," She replied, and we turned our backs.  A startled cry made me turn
283 around too soon.  Lila, wrapped in a shimmering cloth, had run a handful of sand
284 through her hair, and it had cleansed it better than the finest shampoo.
285 We were all excited at that prospect, and one by one cleaned everything about us,
286 and fixed all of our belongings.  Even the rowan staff I had made had the burned
287 spot from the green fire fixed.  Once cleansed and repaired, I looked to our leader
288 and said "Where to now Milchar ?"

334 I followed the example of the good Friar, and cleaned everything about me- my robe, my sandals, my hair- then I got
335 to the items in my pockets.  The Amulet of Zelgar, which I can no longer use, a pipe, a small wand, and a large box 
336 filled with written spells.  All useless to me.  I sighed.  I cleaned them with the sand, and the sand seemed to 
337 dissolve the items into nothing.  Perhaps they were a "dirt" on my character.  The only remaining thing I had was my 
338 ring- but it was as bright and shiny as ever.  I decided to forgo cleaning it.
339 "All spic and span now, are we?  The only thing I can see to do is to keep looking for something out of the "ordinary".
340 Just walk in a direction.", I said.
341 We decided to head north, and soon after we noticed that the pools were deeper.  We began to turn back, but saw that 
342 pools behind were deeper still.  "Odd... I don't recall it being that deep.", Bard said.  Everyone else mumbled i
343 unison.  We trudged on, treading water.  Fortunately the water was warm, and there was no wind.
344 Finally, it became easier to swim.  We began to dive under the water to travel easier.  "Wait.  I could swear I saw a 
345 dark shape moving there.", Piper said.

350 Re: Rome
351 I feel that your message above aways was unjust.  I try to run a respectable
352 board on Rome, and I like to think I've generally succeeded.  Yes, there are
353 quite a few messages about "The Newest Warez" and "My New Club," but I'm trying
354 to change that, and it's getting better.  That's rather why I'm plugging my
355 board here.  Because of the quality of messages here.  If it was easier to get
356 on my board, if I just let everyone on right away, do you think it would be
357 better?  I really doubt it.  I'm trying to mix a "frills" board with a "good
358 message" board as best I can, and that's all I can do.

361 To those who don't like my voting the NotA ticket, I can only say that I feel a moral imperative to vote for a candidate
362 whose Presidency would be in the best interests of the nation, and that None of the Above qualifies. I would vote for
363 myself, but I don't think I'm up to the job (besides being a bit on the down side of the Constitutionally mandated
364 age). I wouldn't wish the job on anyone I know, so if I'm to vote at all it must be for None of the Above. To the person
365 who doesn't think this supports our American system: Right! I'm not anti-American, I simply think the System needs to be
366 changed for the good of the country. Maybe it's time that our Senators & Congresspeople took back the responsibility
367 that was supposed to be theirs in the first place, and return the Presidency to the position in government the framers

372 and he was panting heavily as he rounded the corner of stone his scanner had shown hiding the campsite. 
373 "Hello, everybody! I'm here! Finally caught up with y..." Huh? The campsite showed no signs of life... Not again! He was
374 never going to catch up with them... Dejected, the Poet thrust his hands into the pockets of his robe and turned to
375 leave...and fell into a pool of water. Odd, he thought as he sank and sank, this wasn't here a moment ago... maybe I
376 should surface for a bit of air... Struggling to the surface, he sputtered and fought against the weight of his sodden
377 robe, felt the bottom suddenly come beneath his feet, and sloshed to the shore, where he fell with a squish to the sandy
378 beach. Aagh, he thought, now I remember why I hate the beach, sand gets in everything... Spitting the sand from between
379 his teeth, he looked about. Hey! He wasn't in the Ruby Valley anymore! NOW how was he ever going to find his way back to
380 the Inn?

384 GRATTUS WAS SITTING BACK IN A PLUSH VELVETEEN CHAIR AND, WELL "SUPERVISING" THE PACKING OF THE ENCAMPMENT ON LIMBO ROAD.
385   ASCOMB WAS INSIDE THE CARRIAGE PROBABLY WRESTLING WITH A BEAR SUIT, OR SOMETHING SIMILAR WHEN GRATTUS WAS SURE HE FELT
386 A SLIGHT TWINGE.
387   ON HIS LEFT NOSTRIL, WHICH HAD ALWAYS MEANT IN THE PAST THAT SOMETHING WAS AWRY IN HIS PATH.
388   IT MAY SEEM AWKWARD SAYING THAT SOMETHING AWRY WAS IN HIS PATH (There always was) BUTTHIS TIME THERE WAS AN AUTHENTIC,
389 CURIOUS HAPPENING AFOOT.
390   THAT MAY ALSO SEEM AWKWARD (There is always something curious afoot) BUT THAT IS JUST THE WAY IT WAS.
391  
392   SOMETIME LATER, OUR HEROINE, MISS ASCOMB EMERGED FROM THE CARRIAGE HOLDING A RED GOWN THAT LOOKED AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE
393 BEEN THE CAUSE OF SEVERAL MARRIAGES. POSSIBLY DIVORCES TOO, IF WORN A SECOND TIME.
394   PROUD OF HER SHINING ACHEIVEMENT AND OF THIS EVENINGS CLOTHES SHE HURRIED BACK INTO THE CARRIAGE TO PUT IT ON.
395   iIT HAS ALWAYS SUPRISED ME HOW THE GRINS OF LITTLE GIRLS ALL ARE SOOO SIMILAR.

402 .... "Good Lord", he thought aloud, "Now I'm hearing voices that sound like
403 the piper talking, right here next to me. Last time I heard he was flitting
404 all around the countryside, on some great winged horse, in search of..."

406 The haze cleared and the room swam back into focus. The scene was not one
407 that an external objective observer would call normal. One of the basins was
408 nearly full of blue water and 'Mez' was looking intently at the reflections
409 in its mirror-like surface. At just that moment he looked up and opened his
410 mouth, as if to speak. No sound emerged, but if anyone had been reading his
411 lips they would have seen, < BLUE WATER? >. It certainly was not the usual
412 thing one might expect to find in the baths, that were part of the Inn.

414 P.S.  /MiG/ ----- I've had some experiences with them.
415 :kike, before you reccommend the system in france, please check to see
416 what it does for them. Since no one party can win, it becomes necesary
417 to form coalitions, unstable things best described as strange bed partners.
418 Unstable governments are even worse than bad ones, and they are usually
419 bad too. Stability has merit. We sure don't have a perfect system, but
420 it is the best there is.

425 THEY SUPPORT ALL THE SANYO COMPUTERS INCLUDING THE 4 DIGIT CPM MACHINES.
426 THEY ARE MOSTLY MADE UP OF MBC555 PEOPLE, BUT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS A MORE
427 POPULAR MACHINE, AND THUS MORE PEOPLE USING IT. AS A SIDE NOTE, I JUST
428 HEARD THAT THE SANYO MBC555 IS OUTSELLING THE KAYPRO. INTERESTING IT IS
429 TRUE.
430 BAD: TWASN'T ME TALKING ABOUT FRANCE. IT WAS PIPER I BELEIVE. I HAVE QUIT
431 DEBATING THE SUBJECT, AS I SEE NO NEED TO REPEAT MY VEIWS FOR THE UMPTEENTH
432 TIME WHICH IT HAS SEEMED TO COME DOWN TO. IF THE OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T ACCPET
433 MY PHILOSOPHY AFTER ALL THIS TIME, REPEATING IT ANOTHER COUPLE DOZEN TIMES
434 IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING. I DO NOTICE THOUGH THAT THOSE WHO
435 SEEM TO BE AGAINST THE NOTA VOTE PRECEIVE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO 
436 CANIDATES AND THUS FEEL ONE OF THEM HAS TO BE VOTED FOR. I DON'T SEE A 
437 DIFFERENCE, SO IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHICH ONE GETS CHOSEN, AS I
438 DON'T CARE FOR EITHER ONE. THEY BOTH STINK. THUS I'LL USE MY VOTE TO 
439 SATISFY MY OWN VIEWS. I'LL MAKE IT COUNT FOR ME. THAT IS AFTER ALL WHAT
440 THE 'SYSTEM' REALLY IS ALL ABOUT. VOTING FOR WHAT 'YOU' BELEIVE IN.
441 IF YOU BELEIVE IN FRITZ, VOTE FOR HIM. IF YOU BELEIVE IN RONNIE, VOTE
442 FOR HIM. IF YOU BELIEVE IN PAT PAULSEN VOTE FOR HIM. BUT, HERE I AM
443 DEBATING THE ISSUE AGAIN AFTER I SAID I WAS THRU, SO I'LL SHUTUP.

477 This is Black Magic here,boy no one has left me any messages
478 too bad.
479 
480 I moved swiftly along the rugged road until i came upon
481 the edge of the cliff.No where i could go or i had nothing
482 to do.So i road back along the dark path to the city
483 of Adeni(the city of Black Magic).There was a crowd of 
484 people gathered near the entrence to the palace.They
485 were gathered.near the Queen of Adeni,something must
486 of happend i thought.No!the Queen was assasinated.She did not
487 move,they had the killer right there in custody,but what
488 where they doing.There were five men in Black and one man
489 in a red suit.Now this is very odd.I asked one of the guards
490 what happend.i said"Tell me What is going on here,where's our
491 Queen?".Then he replied"Shhh,listen find out!"
492 To the power and the glory raise your glasses high
493 To the power and the glory be with me tonight.
494 Boy either no one has nothing to say or no one is even
495 calling..................s ya ,good tonight
496 is Halloween and that means no one will be calling
497 the bbs's they will be out at party's or trick or treating.
498 see ya.

500 As the dark mass approached us, the air began dancing and whistling, whipping
501 the water, making us wild with dread and  excitement. An enormous arching wave
502 neared us. Riding its crest was an immense creature in layers of darkly glowing
503 robes whose swirling created the mad wind while the sky blackened and boiled
504 around his head.  His eyes burned sulfur and his every gesture laced the air
505 with gorgeous arcs of luminescence.  We trembled as he stood in that chaos of
506 wind and sky and dark and light, deeply, joyously laughing.
507 "Parlor tricks," he chuckled, abruptly halting the storm.  "This sort of thing
508 impresses my people."  He seemed to think we were above all that in spite of
509 our gaping jaws.  "I understand you will be seeking the golden necklace. For
510 this reason and no other you are my enemy.  The golden necklace keeps my people
511 from evil and I could not bear to see them harmed."  He looked us over sadly.
512 "We have seen that you are not bad--for myself I could never fight you. But if
513 you attack what I love it will be fierce and ugly."
514 His splendidly hideous appearance and tender noble heart made me think of King
515 Kong mooning over Fay Wray. He was too powerful and too likeable to be a good
516 enemy. "I hope," he said, whipping up the wind and sky again, "you will find
517 another way. Don't steal our necklace. Watch this!!"  He waved goodby sending
518 cascades of shimmering light from his fingertips.  "I am Mariani," he called
519 and skimmed out of sight.

529 The Queen layed dark and cold.No one could believe that some
530 person or something killed her.I couldn't tell who it was there
531 where so many people gathered around her.To crowded the guard continued
532 His duty and go about his plan.It was nearing dark in Adeni and 
533 just then the killer was taking out of the city for trial.At least that's my -
534 guess,just then ,an explosion occured on the outer edge of town it was them-
535 they are finally here for us.Everyone started to panic,there was no where to run
536 or even to hide.We tried to out run them in the city but the city was not large 
537 enought,people were dodging arrows,attacking them,even stomping on are own peopl
538 e just then i knew.
