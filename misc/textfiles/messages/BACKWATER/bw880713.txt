 76  
 77 Lord Beaker, the anti-Zod,
 78     You're very correct, I do spend a lot of my time here at 
 79 Backwater II. I can explain this in that because I'm still cursed 
 80 with part time studenthood (untill around 1995 when I get a PhD
 81 in Improbability physics and temporal reajustment) and I'm just a 
 82 simple Berserker whos Jeep recently had its transmission stripped
 83 by his older brother (from 3rd to reverse without the clutch; I'm 
 84 not going anywhere with things like that), Backwater is the closest 
 85 thing I've got to a social life. Sounds pretty pitiful, don't it?
 86 I don't want to get you down, that's the job of a certain Android 
 87 I know of, so I'll quit with this line of thought.
 88       Someone mentioned the difference between anarchy and anarchism
 89 here recently. Wel personally, I find anachronism to be much more 
 90 fun than both of them. But then, what does my opinion matter, I'm 
 91 just an average Paranoid Berserker, who's probably boring you
 92 to death at the moment.
 93                                         Strangely,

125   To whoever asked.  Phoenix Polymorph is a name, indeed my name, not a title.
126 the 'II' means 'The second' as this is the second incarnation of the eternal

132 anyone time to write something interesting.  I have to admit, I used to call
133 just as much but got bored since no one else did.

166 Astral Dreamer: Welcome!  The name is not taken, nor has it ever been
167 to my knowledge; however, similar names do not stop the stubborn.  I
168 remember a time when Backwater was home to three Doctors.  How's that
169 300 baud acoustic working?
170 +++++++++++++
171 	#Awaken,# a voice beckoned.  The command went unheard.
172 	#Shake off thy slumber.  You have more work to do, 'prentice.#
173 	A figure stirred from the cold floor, his stiff muscles protesting
174 every motion.  His eyes flutterd open, blinking away the mist that clouded
175 his vision.  His eyes sought the source of the voice, to no.
176 	#How do you feel?# asked the presence.
177 	"....weak.  I t-thought I was dead."
178 	#No.  Merely....'suspended.'  Do you remember me?#
179 	He searched his memories.  They had an indistinct quality to them,
180 like yesterday's daydreams.  "No.  Who are you?"
181 	#I was at one time your master.  Now do you remember?#
182 	"I...uh....Dimat?  Where are you?  Where are we?  How did I come to
183 be here?  Why..." stuttered the figure.
184 	#Slow down.  I am here.  We are here.  'Here' is a place that really
185 is nowhere, a bubble universe of sorts.  You were placed here just before
186 the Great Change.  You have work to do.# sent the being.
187 	"But why was I chosen?  What is it you would have me do?"
188 	#One of your last acts upon the multiverse was to bestow your
189 mana, your ability for magick, upon your gnome apprentice.  There has been
190 a prophesy: your apprentice's own mana will grow, and with your own his
191 powers will consume him.  If allowed to go his own way, he will cause
192 ruin upon ruin to visit the multiverse.  It is your responsibility to restore
193 the balance you have upset.#
194 	"I must take back the mana?  I did not know it could be done.  It is
195 given only when one is near death."
196 	#There is only one way.  Your apprentice must die.  As he dies, your
197 mana will return to you.#
198 	The figure turned white.  "I...m-must kill him?  My trusted friend,
199 the one who I gifted with all of my magick?  I cannot!"
200 	#You must.  If you do not, eventually more than one reality will
201 cease to exist.  Among the potential casualties is Celene.#
202 	"Not Celene!  Grann would never..."
203 	#He will!  Unless he is stopped now, his powers will grow daily until
204 he cannot resist the temptation to play god.#
205 	"I wil seek him out, persuade him... the future cannot be so dark!"
206 	#Seeking him will suffice for now.  You will see.#
207 	"If I must do this thing, how will I do it?  I have no magick."
208 	A slender rod appeared on the floor near the figure.  He gently
209 took it, examining it carefully.  "Zelgar's wand!  I had thought never to
210 see it again!"
211 	#It was recovered after you lost it.  You know it to be a powerful
212 talisman.  Use it.#
213 	"I don't know," said Milchar, "if I can kill my friend Grann,
214 Even to save the universe."

352   "Do you know what we are, Dr.? We are cultures in a bacteria dish! Think
353 about it. When you have a culture and you sterilize it, do the germs know
354 where the heat comes from? We are a culture surounded by a ring of peni-
355 cillin.  When our intellects stray too far, when we probe our own existence,
356 then we must die. I have strayed too far.  With every thought I go deeper
357 into the penicillin.  The personas in the other world decided to develop
358 a strain for mechanical apitude in th 1800s(Industrial Revolution), and
359 then let it spread. It went from coal, to steam, to electricty, and now
360 atoms.  Now the personas realize they have let it spread too far.  So they
361 must sterilize the dish that we thrive in. How would they do that? Everybody
362 is afraid that an atomic war is inenvitable.  If we develop an atomic shield
363 then we would have a shield.  I can work out the shield, but it will take
364 almost my last breath.  With every note, every scrawl, every diagram, I go
365 deeper into the penicillin.  Yet if we finish this, we just might make it!

407 How 'bout dis un:
408     "He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword!" 
409 do you know what dis means to your average Berserker?
410 Well basically we think that it says that if we live honorably by the 
412 sword in life, we shall die honorably by the sword in battle, rather than
413 wait for death to find us cowering in our beds.
414 I have been told that this interpretation of the above statement isn't
415 correct, and that it actually has a different meaning. Is this true?
416   
417 Also, one of the reasons I find Nuclear war so repugnant is because of 
418 the above statement. You can't issue a challenge to a warhead, and where
419 is the honor in slaughtering innocent (or at least uninvolved) people with
420 such a weapon? Tis better to have One on one duel between the leaders (any
421 type of challenge, it need not be combat) than to slaughter the subjects.
422 I should much rather die to a worthy opponent than to a mindless missile.

555         It was a dark road Milchar travelled, a dark road indeed.
556 It wound between realities, held in place by forces larger than any
557 mortal had wielded, created as if an afterthought by a being he had
558 once known, but now seemed to be a complete stranger.  Milchar shook his
559 head, confused, and continued his long journey.
560         Centuries- or perhaps only hours-  later, the road he followed
561 entered a tunnel, blacker than the darkest night he had known.  With
562 a little trepidation, he entered it.
563         Instantly, Milchar found himself upon another road, of the more
564 common sort.  It was narrow and twisted quickly out of sight in both
565 directions, leaving no clue as to which was the best to follow.  After
566 mentally flipping a coin, the tired mage turned left, wondering where it
567 led, if anywhere.
568 +++++++++++++++++++
569         "Careful there, Grann!" jeered a voice.  "The Karegi are hungry
570 tonight!"
571         The gnome ignored it.  He was confident his abilities would more
572 than suffice for this contest.  Karegi, he knew, were vicious carnivores
573 and magickal, to boot- but they could be controlled through magick.
574 The spell was simple, but it drained energy from its user as it worked.
575 This contest was as simple as the spell- last longer than any of the other
576 contestants.
577 	The Karegi Grann controlled was female- Grann had drawn lots for
578 the creature to control, and he knew females fought the spell harder.  His
579 bad luck.  Darrin, on the other hand, had been lucky and drawn the runt of
580 the pack.
581 	Both contestants stood in an animal pen with their animals.  There
582 were also two chunks of meat within the pen, to distract the Karegi long
583 enough to allow the contestants to get out with their hides intact.
584 	Sweat began to pour over Darrin's features as his own mana level
585 dropped, exhaustion creeping closer.  Grann, to his suprise, felt fine-
586 and already the contest had broken the village's record.  He could not help
587 but smile at Darrin, much to the rage of the other.
588 	Suddenly, Darrin's Karegi turned to face Grann.  Hunger shone through
589 those cold eyes.  Its muscles tensed to spring-
590 	Reflex took over.  Grann's female leapt up to meet the male, blocking
591 its way.  Darrin had jumped out of the pen, afraid for his life, not seeing
592 what had happened but knowing he had lost control.
593 	Grann's mind reached out with another spell-
594 	He had both Karegi under his control.
595 	The gnome watched the two Karegi sit absolutely still for a few
596 moments, and then calmly walked to the gate of the pen and let himself out.
597 The instant the latch was in place both animals sprang for the door, their
598 large mass hitting it and shaking the entire pen.
599 	Onlookers stared in amazment.  The award ceremony followed next, and
600 the village cheered for their strongest mage.  It was some time before
601 Grann could return home, alone.
602 	"Apprentice!" he yelled as he returned to his laboratory.  A gnome
603 lad popped in from nowhere.  "Fetch me the old book.  It's happening again.
604 My power is growing rapidly, and I must know why."

714 My short rest had rejuvinated me. I came out of my meditation and began
715 to move with purpose through the ether. There was A place I must go, A
716 weapon I must pick up.
717  
718 As I moved I was very carfull to be sure that I was not followed, My path
719 could not be vissible if I was to be succesfull. After much time I came
720 to the place I had been seeking. It was small pocket in this other space
721 I traveled, Unknown to all but me. I checked the seal carfully to be sure
722 that none had entered and was relieved to see that all was well,
723  
724 going through I was carfull to reset the wards and traps. I went to the small
725 room that sat in the middle of the clearing that was the entire extent of 
726 this land. I entered the building slowly, I did not want to disturb the device
727 that sat there, there were things that I must do in order to make it safe for
728 me to approach to closly.
729 It sat as I had last seen it, A small grey orb that pulsed with power.
730 I paused a moment to build my concentration. With a long outtake of
731 breath I began the ritual.

833 can never be certainty in the realms that you travel. You were sent
834 here for a reason, And that wac0to wet the Orb. It sensed this, And so
835 the binding did not go well. If the guise had not been strong and your
836 felling of danger real it would not have worked at all."
837 "Who did this, The man in black?"
838 "I do not know, He may have been o~ly q distraction. The real threat may lay
839 elsewere. You  know what it means to be bound to the Orb don't you?"

841 "And do you know what it means to be bound to the Orb improperly?"

843 "Yuc, Y had not known myself when I walked these realms. I have been sent

849 and complete it you will be slowly consumed by the power of the Orb.

947 Or maybe I just imagined that you responded. Or maybe you just imagined

951 is imagined? If we can't make sure that things are bual,0then nothing may 
952 be real. If nothing is real, then none of us exist, which means that we 
953 should quit imagining that we are, and get a firm grip on unreality.
954 Therefore, it's no use wasting this non-existant disk space, because 
955 theru's nobody out there to read it, and nobody here to write it.
