20 Kathy: there you go, a nice new clean disk. (Well, almost clean, and maybe
21 a little used, but it IS servicable. <ahem>)
22 PAM: Three entries in 4 days! I'm in shock! I feel sorry for the poor guy
23 at the phone though, I have seen similar actions myself. Indeed, I think
24 I have probably been the target of such actions myself in the past, as
25 I am sure we all have at one time or another. The important thing is
26 how you take it, if you take it in the light of the joke it is, you'll
27 be a lot happier. If you take it as someone trying to make you look like
28 a fool, you will feel misserable for being foolish enough to fall for it.
29 Now what brought that on? Every time I read one of your entries, I seem
30 to try to relate it to real life. Why is that? Why can't I accept them
31 for the enjoyable reading that they are? Strange reaction.
32 Leonard: If I ever find the masters again, I will see if I can answer 
33 some of your questions. It seems they have gone into hiding again. Argh!

36     As the 'digit juggler' wended his way back toward his favorite table he
37 picked up glimpses of several conversations. Both the activity level and the
38 number of persons had increased. Either some new persons had appeared or some
39 persons had a new appearance, he wasn't sure which. In any case, the many new
40 stories and discussions were music to his ears. "Now that's the kind of
41 atmosphere that made the Inn famous.", he said to himself.
42 
43     Reaching into his pocket he pulled out a gold coin and placed it on the
44 table, next to his glass.

49 Not to worry, Measure #9 will NOT require moving the cemeteries. It says:
50 "wastes generated.... through industrial or manufacturing processes which
51 contain only naturally occurring radioactive isotopes." Bodies don't fall
52 under this heading, but *ALL* industrial garbage DOES! Everything is a BIT
53 radioactive, but they don't seem to realize this.
54     The siting requirements look like they will prohibit dumping ANYTHING
55 ANYWHERE in Oregon! Especially the clause about "...there will be no release of
56 radioactive materials or radiation from the waste." (note: heat & light are 
57 "radiation", that is why the langauge that measure 9 DELETED had been so 
58 specific about what KINDS of radiation!)
59    It is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to meet that "no release" requirement. There is
60 always going to be some release. It may not be MEASUREABLE, but then they didn't
61 say "no measureable release", they had to say "no release". Idiots! Why not try
62 to pass a law saying that no car can be sold unless there is NO chance of a part
63 failure (not no reasonable chance, NO chance. It would be the same kind of
64 stupidity)
65    The real world DOES NOT give you ABSOLUTE certainties.

110 Pam; Please forgive it, it's merely a Commode 64, and NO ONE knows what it means by 'nominal'!  Ask L'homme, they're
111 not the most friendly things to communicate with.  I didn't kick it, but I did deprive it of power for a few hours.  
112 ('Go into your room without any dinner!')
113 Piper; must have missed that, not to worry, your mode of transport does not matter at this point.  I was ready for a
114 final entry on this story a little while back but the 'Blue Demon' entry frotzed part of my storyline.  It may turn out
115 better this way, however.  On I go...
116 ++++++++++++
117 I guided the group to my home, a small cottage at the edge of the Valley.  It was but a stone's throw from the western
118 Keystone gate, roomy, and quite comfortable.  I asked them to leave their mounts and join me for a meal inside.  The 
119 fire was out... "Nuxv!", I cried.  It flickered to life again, bringing cheer to their gloomy faces.  It was quite dark
120 out now, and a storm was brewing.  It was already beginning to rain.  "Come in, come in, and lay your friend on the 
121 bed there.  That's it.  Sit over here, my friends, and I shall tell you some things you should know."  Good, I thought
122 to myself, everything set, now just spring it on them while they're eating...
123 I made sure everyone had a large portion of the stew I had cooking, and then began:
124 "Long ago, the Blue Demon was free in all of the Center Realities:  He stomped through the Red, splashed through the
125 Blue, and swept through the Green... The Gold he had no interest in, as no one lives there.  The only restriction to 
126 his movement was the timing of the Gates, which, as you know, are only open at certain times.  He could not move 
127 directly from one to another, through the Keystone.  Ah, but among you, only your sleeping friend knows about that.  
128 I shall try to explain: It is a room of indeterminable size which connects all four quarters of the Center Realities by
129 means of doors.  It has existed since the birth of time, and shall fall at Time's death.  Anyway, the Blue Demon was 
130 prevented from crossing there by D - a wizard of such power that realities have suddered with the potence of his words.
131 D imprisioned him in a chamber deep beneath your very feet, and I am the Keeper.  Or rather, I was.  If D hears of my 
132 failure to confine Barkahni I shall.. let us not speak of such things."
133 Their leader, Piper by name, asked me, "If D is so powerful, wouldn't he know of the necklaces, and the location of
134 all of the pieces?"
135 I did not hesitate.  "Yes, he would.  He created them."  Now to wait for their reaction.  It seemed to be one of 
136 stunned silence.  I hoped that was a good sign, for this was my only chance to redeem my error with Barkahni...
137 "Do you know?", he asked.  Bright one, he is.  "Yes.", I replied.
138 "Where?  You obviously know us, and our need.", he said.
139 "Just outside of the Keystone, on the Gold side.  But wait, there is a catch."  Damn, I hated to pull this on them.  D
140 and hiis bloody projects.
141 "D left the last quarter of the necklace inside a machine of some sort, to be retrieved when a puzzle was solved."  
142 They groaed.  Only one seemed not to care, a Friar who was looking after Milchar.  
143 Piper asked, "Ok, If we do get the last piece, if we complete the necklace, What do we do with it?"
144 Frotz.  Right into classified territory.  I had sworn to never reveal that, for reasons of "security".  D had said that
145 if someone deserved to wear the necklace, they would find out on their own.  I decided to tell them that.  And so I did.
146 They brooded over the whole story, and I left for a moment to check on those standing orders for the mage.  Tome #729...
147 page 1094, paragraph 5, section 13.87:  Milchar is to receive ..... during the duration of the dampening, to prevent 
148 collapse into coma due to his ancestry.  But why would a Damper put someone out?  Another damn puzzle.  I put the tome 
149 back, and offered to guide the group to the machine.  If they only succeeded...  And were was I to find Argentite 
150 around here?

157 INTRO: Kathy has just picked up her digital disk player from the shop

233   Greetings all, my first personal message on this system. This is going to be blasted interesting;
234   Kathy, thanks for the little 'most of it' addendum. I feel somewhat insulted (Yes, I am hoping that you will reassure
235 me that this isn't so)
236   Pam, I'm sure you already know it, but you are a top drawer writer. A freind of mine, well noted for reading four 
237 novels a week has commented thusly. If I may be so bold, he says that you are very good but need an editor to come in
238 and insist on a better finished product.
239   Although I do understand the reasons for not heavily editing work here; I am only echoing her thoughts on the subject.
240   Well, that was really easy. Gee, I oughta do this more often. See you all soon.

245      Boy, did I ever have trouble getting this board figured

247 got easier. It sure is different than what I'm used to.
248      Nobody knows what's going on with the police and fire 
249 trucks. We figured we'd check it out on the six O'clock news 
250 rather than go out in the miserable weather. It's just too nice
251 by the fire.
252      Gotta go now. I've spent more than my share of time 
253 fooling around with this system. Think I got it figured out 
254 though. Later.

259 They mumbled for a bit, then nodded assent.  The Friar asked, "What about Milchar- he doesn't seem to be getting any
260 better, and frankly I haven't the foggiest idea why he's out at all... no temperature, pulse normal, he should be 
261 walking about."  Remember to leave out most of what you know, Novar.  "Leave him here, he'll be fine... It's only a 
262 short walk to the machine.  He'll get over it.", I lied.  I think I remember a small deposit of Argentium in the 
263 Diamond Vally... hmm, not too far from the machine.  My luck was getting better.  "All those who wish to stay and rest
264 here are quite welcome to."  No one did.
265 I strode quickly outside, the adventurers following closely behind.  As I expected, the Gate was open before we 
266 arrived.  D knew of our coming.  What didn't he know?
267 We entered the Keystone, our footsteps echoing from the granite walls.  "Ahh, seekers, healers, and destroyers.  But 
268 without knowledge, the last element.  I grant you passage to the Diamond Valley.  Only one other has found his way this
269 far, but he has failed.  I wish you luck, all of you- including you, Novar."  I could tell by his tone that he knew all
270 about Barkahni.  Amazingly, he didn't seem to care.  I wondered exactly where I had sent the Blue Beast.
271 The Diamond door had opened slowly.  The valley beyond was beautiful, a sculpture of glass and diamond, twisted into 
272 every imaginable shape until they intertwined in places.  The thing that drew the eye even more than the breathtaking 
273 view, however, was the machine.
274 It wasn't tall.  Or big.  In fact, it was quite small by planar standards.  But I knew what it could do.  I shuddered
275 involuntarily.
276 "Please, advance and examine the machine.  I must go for a moment to find a rare... uh, herb for you friend.  I shall 
277 return soon."  I was off, half in persual of the Argentium and half in retreat from the machine.  Better they work it
278 alone. I knew what the lettering on it read, and that if they failed they would bring upon them a terrible ordeal.  
279 Some would not survive.  I pushed it all out of my mind and hunted for the deposit.
280 +++++++++++++++++
281 I felt myself floating in a void.  Only my presence existed, not even my body showed itself here.  Still, I had this 
282 uneasy feeling of being pressed in upon.  By what?  I thought it through.  The last thing I remembered was seeing some
283 sort of huge blue creature barrelling toward me a breakneck speed.  Was I dead?  I could't be sure.  I felt as I did 
284 when my soul-self was released, but I could not see anything- as if I was confined, which brings us back to the pressed
285  in feeling.
286 Finding a clue in logic, I tried to find the boundries of my prison.  Probing about, I discovered I was in a bubble of
287 some sort, about 7 feet across.  Funny- I thought I felt a contraction.  I did!  Oh, no... at that rate, I will be 
288 squished to nothing in another ten minutes or so... unless I could do something.  But what?  My powers were gone.  My 
289 soul-self couldn't even rely on the Ring, it seemed that my projection had neglected to bring it with me.  It was 
290 probably still on the physical body.
291 Somehow I had to get energy- and a lot of it.  Extra-planar links were out, for I had no magic; the Ring was out... 
292 what was left?  Me?
293 Of course!  ME!  The human body, the source of so much creativeness and emotion and energy... it just might work.
294 I relaxed.  Better to prepare oneself beforehand.  Concentrating, I imagined a huge knife cutting through the stuff of
295 the bubble.  Straining harder, I began to sweat.  A dim outline of a huge knife formed outside... but lo and behold, I
296 also saw the substance of the bubble become a little more opaque.  It wanted to fight.  I found new energy, threw it 
297 lavishly into my concentration...
298 ++++++++++++ Novar & Milchar ++++++++++++++++++++++ 10:27 on 11/09/84 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
299 THOUGHTS AND OBSERVATIONS FOR THE DAY, THE WEEK, AND FRIDAY NIGHT IN DOWNTOWN.
300 Phil Collins. Ever listen to him? Can he rattle the skins or not? Is his ability to produce harmonical systems far
301 beyond his contemporaries? Do you ever REALLY listen to the sounds that permeate the air around you? Does anyone ever
302 really pay attention to their environment? Why does Miami Vice insist on playing Phil Collins aka Genesis?
303 Night life. How many of you out there live during the day so you can LIVE during the night? Is it true that night time
304 brings out the best and the worst in all of us? Have you ever walked down the street alone, contemplating your
305 position in society with more than a passing thought of self-conscious pity? Have you ever noticed how the city
306 changes at night? I am not talking about east county haunts or cheap west side dives. I am talking downtown. The city.
307 Metropolis. The burg. Portland. The rose city. The transit mall. The place where it all happens. The hub of the state.
308 A place where all the vibrant energy of the area flows and ebbs. Downtown is a place like no other. At night it changes
309 like the coloring of the sky at sunset. It is a place of mystery and delight. A place of utter horror and unbelievable
310 excitement. The buildings are like silent sentinels watching down on us with one or more lighted eyes. Their patterns
311 on the sky form grotesque shapes in the lightless atmosphere. Cars swarm like leaderless insects searhing for a
312 picnic to raid or an animal to bother. The running lights reflected on the wet pavement double the effect of movement.
313 The sounds of man-made engines disturb the night air, causing pain to both ear and nose. Their effects are twofold.
314 They carry passengers from one end of the city to another. Are the people going to some distant locale, or are they 
315 escaping a depressing situation at home? They are drawn from the outer edges of the area like gnats to fruit. The 
316 lure of the city is unfathomable. It can not by fully described, only analyzed in part, but in turn, each part
317 remains a mystery. The city and its night life. Woe to the person who does not experience it in its true form.
318 Try it. Experience it. It is like nothing else. We can all be thankful for that.
319 A bus stop. I arrive on time, hoping to make my stay at the semi-covered artifact of human planning short. Several
320 others occupy distinct positions in and around the shelter. Times and ETA's flash on a nearby monitor. The numbers
321 are meaningless. Buses, those huge mechanical beasts with minds driven by men, abide not by numbers on a screen, but
322 by their own hopes and desires. My wait is not short. My bus is late. Very late. I wait, for I am but a small piece in
323 a much larger picture. I wonder how the others feel. Do they realize what the 'big' picture is? Or do they hold on the
324 antiquated notion that they can still control their own destinies? I look at each person, one by one. Thinking, hoping,
325 wondering, analyzing, and then, not concluding, but merely storing what I have observed. A young male, not much older
326 than I. He stands, hands plunged in his pockets, backpack hanging from his shoulder, waiting as do the rest of us. 
327 What line? What destination. I will never know. It does not matter. My eyes shift, and a new subject comes into sight.
328 A women, late 20's, hair still wet, but neatly combed. Penny loafers on her feet. Blue jeans and backpack are other 
329 noticeable things. A worried look crosses her face, as she glances at me and then at the schedule displayed on the
330 monitor. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting for a bus that will someday come. Always late. Always behind. Where could it be?
331 Another young women. Quite attractive. Silk stockings, huge earrings, stylish clothes, backpack, and a blank stare.
332 Where is she going? Most likely a student. Same place as me? Probably not. Shifted eyes. New person. Now a business
333 man. Brooks Brothers suit. Wall Street Journal. Brief case, no backpack here. Folding umbrella. Off to work. Some office
334 , some high rise. Big money. BMW at the park and drive. McKormics for lunch. 12 to 1. Maybe see you there sometime.
335 Others too. Many more to describe. Wait! Movement in the ranks. A noise, motion in the street. Large, white, black,
336 belching smoke. No smell yet. Gotta get by first. A bus...comes to a stop. Doors open, and people file out. People like
337 the rest of us, waiting for something, sitting instead of standing. Arriving instead of leaving. On a bus instead of
338 on the sidewalk, under the shelter. I move forward, let the women get on first. Always the gentleman. I take my seat.
339 I don't have to stand this time. Such luck. Doors close. Air hisses. Engine roars, and buses move. Destination, does it
340 matter? As long as I get there in time. Always the clock to watch. Always the schedule to keep. Will it ever end?

351 MY OBSERVATIONS FOR THE MESSAGE ABOVE LSP, A SATURDAY, A MSG OF NOTHINGNESS.
352 Well, I called up BWMS.  It rang and rang, then it answered.  BEEP.  So
353 I turned on my modem, BEEP.  It connected, neet.  I started to print all the
354 lines from the place that I left off at.  It was boring.  I wished that this
355 board make it easy to skip a line.  I looked at the clock, it was late.  Then
356 this message about observations came up, I was still bored.  The many pages
357 scrolled by as my thumbs twitled a silent twitle.  neet, I was having fun. I
358 started to thing why I was up so late, why I called, why am I reading this
359 message.  It went on and on and on and on and on.  get the picture get the
360 picture get the picture?  I saw the end, but it was just the begging.  I  
361 started to throw my pencil at the wall hoping it would stick.  It didn't.
362 I picked it up and threw it harder, it didn't stick.  I didn't pick it up.
363 I noticed that the message about observations was still going.  I went out for
364 a snack.  A big sandwich sounded good.  I got out the mayonaise jar, it was
365 empty.  I reached for the mustard, after I pulled my hand out from the fridge
366 and saw that I grabbed the chocolate syrup.  I put it back.  I bent over and
367 looked into the bread drour, there was no bread.  I didn't have a big sandwich
368 that sounded good.  I moped back into my room, the message about observations
369 was still going.  Too bad the death penalty didn't pass.  I was bored.  I
370 reached over and picked up my pencil.  I was still bored.  I turned on the T.V.
371 It was wrestling.  I turned the channel.  It was static.  I turned the channel.
372 More static.  I turned it again, it was wrestling.  I kicked my T.V.  Now it
373 was all static.  Too bad.  No my foot hurt and I was still bored.  I got up
374 and went over to my window.  I opened the curtains and looked outside.  It was
375 dark.  I closed my eyes, it was still dark so I opened them.  It was still 
376 dark.  I sat back down in front of the computer.  I was still bored.  The 
377 message about the observations was over.  I didn't care.  It all looked the
378 same anyway.  I turned off my monitor, it was dark.  I looked over towards the
379 window, it was dark too.  I turned on the monitor, I liked it better off.  I
380 got up and walked around.  I turned on the radio.  I couldn't hear anything at
381 all.  I turned up the volume.  My foot still hurt, and I'm bored!  I looked
382 outside again, it was still dark.  I turned off the radio.  My foot still hurt.
383 I sat infront of the computer again.  So I sat infront of the computer again.
384 I moved my chair back a few feet.  I planted one foot firmly to one side and
385 shoved off.  I was spinning in circles and I'm still bored.  The chair stopped.
386 I fell out, I was dissy.  I looked up at the screen, it was still.  I wondered
387 why it wasn't doing something.  I got back up into the chair.  My foot hurt.
388 I leaned forward to type something and the chair fell apart.  I fell off the
389 chair again.  I got up and fixed the chair then sat infront of the computer
390 again.  I tried to type something and I could reach the keyboard.  I scooted
391 forward.  The computer wasn't doing much.  I turned it off.  I took the disk 
392 out of the drive.  It got stuck.  I gently tugged a little harder.  It was 
393 still stuck.  I grabbed the end and yanked for all I was worth.  The disk came
394 out.  I tried to put it back into the cover but it wouldn't fit.  I tried a
395 little harder.  It didn't fit.  I grabbed the disk and rammed it into the 
396 cover.  There was noplace for me to put my disk.  All the room was filled.
397 I pinned it to the wall.  It stuck.  I walked into the front hall.  My foot
398 still hurt.  I opened the door and walked outside.  It was dark.  I walked
399 over to the street lamp, it was tall.  There was nobody else around.  All
400 were asleep at home.  I went home.  I walked in and shut the door.  My foot
401 hurt and I was cold and bored.  I walked back down the halway to the 
402 computer.  There was nothing to look at.  I turned on the light.  There was
403 something to look at.  I sat back down infront of the computer.  The chair
404 didn't break.  I took the disk off of the wall and put it in the disk drive.
405 I took the disk out and removed the cover.  This time it fit better.  I turned
406 the computer back on and sat there.  Nothing happened.  I shut the drive door.
407 This was better.  The disk didn't work.  I was mad, cold, my foot hurt and
408 I was still bored.  I remembered that I left something outside, it was a disk.
409 I got up and walked outside.  I saw the disk in the middle of the street.  I
410 started to walk towards it.  I bent over to grab the disk.  I got hit by a
411 london bus.  Double decker that is.  I got dragged along for quite a while
412 before the bus made a sharp turn and I was thrown off a cliff.  I plumitted
413 to a painfull death.  My disk was bent.  I was sad.  I was dead!  Too bad,
414 my foot didn't hurt.
415 THE MORAL OF THIS STORY IS : Cancer is harmfull to your health.

419   Milchar -- you're doing fine.  I wish I could contribute more, but my chance
420 may come later.  Continue, please.
421   Perhaps it's not traditional to comment on an entire disk, but I feel like
422 this one shows a few traits that we could all learn from.  First, on the subject
423 of editing -- any would be writer will be tremendously improved by the work of
424 a conciencious editor.  Warning!  It hurt's like hell.  Although we delude 
425 ourselves that we don't have a particular affection for our own writings, they
426 still are our creations, and we, in a very real sense, are their parents.  There
427 never was a piece of writing that could not be improved.  My first major edit
428 took nearly two weeks, in two-hour sessions every other day.  In that time I
429 learned more about the english language than in all my previous schooling 
430 (including some college 400 level courses).  The relationship you have with your
431 editor is crucial.  You either come out a grateful fast friend, or have made an
432 enemy for life.  (My editor wouln't pass that last sentence, either.)  But, what
433 an editor can do is help you with how you say something -- not with what you say.
434 An editor gives advice and help on the craft of writing -- how to construct the
435 basic blocks of communication, how to craft a sentence that says what you want
436 it to say, a paragraph that "works", and how to put complex and perhaps incoherent
437 thoughts into some sort of logical organization.  The editor cannot help you 
438 with WHAT to say.  That is your exclusive provence -- you can ask for advice,
439 but YOU must decide to abide by it or not.  
440   We've got two entries above -- one a simple pastiche on life at a bus stop,
441 the other a reaction to it from somone who doesn't seem to care for it.  Why 
442 does the one seem alive, the other merely tedious?  How could the second author
443 have used satire to ridicule the first effectively?  (or COULD it bee done?)
444 I feel that a careful look at this disk will show much that is good, some that's
445 bad, and by asking ourselves "why?" we can improve ourselves.
446   OK, kiddies, class is over.  Sorry for going into a lecture!

450  
451      I stand upon the Plain Of Jars, where the wind eternally blows hot and
452 humid, where the only light is that provided by the burning of damned souls
453 in torment, and once again I attempt to light the fire.  For what seems
454 like days I struggle with stone and flint until I finally achieve a spark,
455 so small and feeble against the unholy gloom, but still it is a spark that
456 lands upon the twigs before me to smolder uncertainly.  Quickly I fall to
457 my knees before the tiny trail of smoke, as if in worship of this tiny god
458 of fire.  Cautiously I blow, shielding the ember, nursing and nourishing
459 and protecting it, until it finally bursts into unsteady flame.
460  
461      As I continue to feed this fire, inwardly I exult!  Perhaps this time
462 I have won!  Could it be possible, can I fan this fire to something
463 greater?  So long, so long, so many years I've waited for just such a
464 chance, but always in the past all my efforts have been but a sword against
465 an army.  But this time I WILL win, this time I WILL finally arrive at my
466 goal, this time......
467  
468      Again the rain begins.  The work of days is destroyed, the fire of my
469 efforts is quickly snuffed, doused as if it were nothing.  Ever so slowly I
470 realize that it was nothing, mere delusion and pride and ego.  How could I
471 think that I could make a difference, that I could bring light to the
472 darkness or bring warmth to the coldness of a world so much greater than
473 myself?  Here I stand, like Sisyphus, condemned to a task that can never be
474 accomplished, but knowing that I must continue to try.  The pain of knowing
475 how truly hopeless my mission is drives me down, holds me tighly in the
476 terrible grasp of despair, and I collapse onto the now muddy Plain Of Jars.
477  
478                          ---------------------------
479  
480      I awaken suddenly, nearly jumping from the bed in this motel room that
481 is a clone of so many others in the chain.  I'm soaked in cold sweat from
482 the intensity of my dream, and I feel chilled by the persperation that
483 clings to me.  I don't need to look at my watch to know what time it is, I
484 always seem to have bad dreams at a specific time of night.
485  
486      Walking to the bathroom, I turn the heat lamp and fan on, then start
487 the shower at only slightly less than hot enough to peel skin on touch.  I
488 so wish I was home.

495 Bill:
496 
497      I can't believe there wasn't anything on the six O'clock
498 news about the disaster, or whatever it was. My brother said he
499 saw several television news trucks on the scene. I thought once
500 those guys showed up it was gauranteed something would be on
501 the news. It's really strange.
502      What makes it even stranger is that there wasn't anything
503 in the Oregonian either. From all the excitement you'd think it
504 would be a major news story. But nothing. I don't get it.
505      Carrol drove down the highway and says the road blocks 
506 are down and that she couldn't see anything unusual. Sunday
507 a bunch of us are going to take the four wheel drive into the
508 back country to see what we can see. Something is going on 
509 and we're going to figure out what it is.

514   Well, after a long time away from the Inn it looks in good
515  shape.  The air is clean and the talk is nice.  I like it
516  this way.  It is a nice escape from all of the computer talk
517  on the other boards.  Any way, when did Pam return?  The last
518  I heard of her was when every once and a while there was a
519  message like "Won't you come back Pam?".  It's nice to see
520  your writing again.  I better be off.  Maybe nobody ever
521  noticed that I was hear or that I had gone but it is nice to
522  be back.

526 To writer of observations on a friday night:  much too wordy for
527 my tastes, but ok otherwise. 
528 To writer of the hurt foot and the nonfunctioning disk: quite
529 humurous I think, also a little wordy but funny, I rarely chuckle
530 sitting in front of my terminal, what whould people think?
531 To Pam: Another good piece of work, say Pam, would you ever con-
532 sider getting in on writing a comic book with me? I know of

570 L'homme: Nothing major. I did notice that in terror if you throw the club anyplace other then at the wall, nothing happens.
571 A bit unnerving since normally there is some kind of response.
572 The main problem is the BASIC versions won't run on the SANYO. This is
573 because it doesn't like your BASIC structure. (File control can't be mixed
574 type like you have, and no nested if's.) Also, need to be able to disable
575 the color, as the Sanyo goes weird if you try to show color on a black and 
576 white monitor. And finally, the basic versions wouldn't run on my Z150
577 either. (I was using basica) I assume that you wrote it in GWbasic given
578 from what I saw of the code. (My GWbasic is on back order, so I can't try
579 it under that yet.)
