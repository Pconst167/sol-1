24    That was very interesting about the difference of the speed of 
25 light in water, as compared to that of a vacume. That kind of gives more
26 support to the theory of light being a form of matter, because you can
27 say the speed difference would be explained by resistance put up by
28 the water.
29    But does this mean anything?
30 Deb: when I mentioned that people were getting upset over the current
31 topic I was refering to the "Does God Exist" question.

38 BARD: Contremon may be gone but LeRoy McKane is still with 
39 us. He's merely sitting back and waiting until the 
40 conversation deteriorates to a point where his immoral 
41 decadence will be appropriate. 
42 
43 Andy Rooney: I miss your insightless questions and comments. 
44 
45 Mohammed, Serena, Valinor, & Mike: The old story got old but 
46 a new story would be new. That is, of course, if the speed of 
47 light at your place is going as fast as it is at mine. If not 
48 it is probably a sign that God is only using the left side of 
49 his brain and we are doomed.
50 
51 Natasha is dead, LeRoy is in hiding, and Bill Broonzy is 
52 sitting back and doing God knows what. Monsieur d'Autan made 
53 a brief appearance but disappeared. Does this mean reality 
54 has been placed in the hands of those who believe real is 
55 real, truth is true, and the answer lies in facts?

71 - VERY boring to me... howerver playing them is fun, because  -
72 - you get self-satisfaction. One thing.... ever notice in a   -
73 - football game that the game lasts 2 hours and only a solid  -
74 - 15 minutes is ever played? The ball doesn't go enough! I    -
75 - Find raquetball to be a very moving sport as it gives you   -
76 - hand/eye coordination, agility and strengthens your limb    -
77 - muscles. 90% of the time is spent playing and is a very fun -

136 Hello, I'm the Walrus.  I'm new on the block so feel free to show me
137 around.  Well, for one thing, I have an Apple ][ plus with 64K and a Hayes
138 Micromodem IIe.  Now, to get down to business, I'm not sure whether it was
139 this disk or B, but arguement about religion seemed to be a hot item.  So,
140 I'd like to put in my two binary digits.  First, I feel that it is highly
141 unlikely that a God exists.  I mean, we know and accept the fact that pri-
142 mative man created gods to explain unanswered questions such as why it rained
143 and the like.  So why is it that Christians or Jews should be right in their
144 belief?  And on top of that, science has found practical reasons for the
145 things that God was supposed to do.  I mean, Christians are nice people in
146 general and I'm sure that if Christianity hadn't spread, far worst beliefs
147 would have taken root.  As a not-so-famous atheist once said, "I never met
148 a Christian I didn't like, with the possible exception of Cardinal Armond
149 Richelieu."  I'm sure you'll be hearing from me again.

154 HUH??? FOTI: YOU SEEM TO HAVE YOUR FORCES MIXED UP, THE FORCE YOU ARE
155 TALKING ABOUT WITH THE ROLLER COASTER IS CENTRIFUGAL FORCE. ALSO IT IS
156 NOT THE FORCE THAT KEEPS YOU ON THE EARTH. IF THE EARTH WERE TO STOP 
157 SPINNING, YOU WOULD STILL STAY ON THE EARTH. GRAVITY IS RELATED TO
158 THE MASS OF A BODY, NOT TO ITS RATE OF SPIN. THE MOON IS KEPT IN
159 ORBIT AROUND THE EARTH BY A BALANCING OF THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE OF 
160 MOVING AROUND THE EARTH, AND THE GRAVITY OF THE EARTH PULLING IT IN
161 (PLUS TO A LESSER EXTENT THE MOONS GRAVITY PULLING THE EARTH TOWARDS IT.)

193 "Well, Lynn, if you aren't interested in filling in these gents, I'll try.
194 Correct me if I make any mistakes."
195 The Poet, unused to speaking with a dry throat, took a moment to empty his
196 #4 ale.
197 "My fellow adventurers, not long ago the peace and quiet of our Inn was 
198 shattered by the exchange of a variety of high-powered weapons, apparently
199 imported from a highly technological reality. The King (whose interference
200 in the affairs of the Inn are wisely kept to a minimum) asked Lynn here to
201 contact her father, my esteemed friend in gray, to find and bring to 
202 punishment the person or persons responsible. I have joined with them for 
203 reasons of my own, and we are asking any who are interested to aid us in the
204 search. The only clue we have to date is my sighting of a bald man in a 
205 yellowish robe leaving the Inn to the reality of Innisfall on the night in
206 question. Thinking back, I've seen people garbed like him before. I think 
207 they call themselves "Hairy Fishnuts" or something of the sort. Our friend
208 here," he said, gesturing to the Piper, "has the ability to bridge realities
209 with his music. This should aid us, for I fear this search will take in
210 many worlds before we are finished. Make no mistake, we are doubtless 
211 dealing with despeate and dangerous beings here, and involvement could be 
212 risky. But I, for one, will risk anything to assure the continued peace of
213 my drinking space at the Inn. And here is my pledge of arms!"
214 So saying, the mad-eyed Poet scooped up his four empty mugs and tossed them
215 into the air. Then, faster than any could follow, four small stars seemed 
216 to fly from his hands, shattering the glasses at their apex.
217 "Oops...got carried away there," he said, as shards rained down on his
218 audience."Uh...Innkeeper, could you put those on my tab?"
219                   && The Mad Actor &&

229 
230 "Hairy fishnuts!!"  The piper stroked his beard thoughtfully.  "I'm not sure
231 that I really want to get too closely involved with those people.  I'm a much
232 better lover than fighter, begging the lady's pardon.  However -- I agree,
233 it really must be done.  I have a shrapnel scar on my bag from that exchange.
234 Mind you, now, I cannot control reality, I can only influence it.  My pipes 
235 and myself are at your service."
236 
237  "I'll be right back.  Hairy fishnuts!!"  The piper stood up and blew into his
238 pipes.  As the sound of the drones began, he shimmered slightly, grew 
239 transparent, and dissappeared.  Within a few moments, the faint sound of the
240 pipes returned, seemingly from a great distance.

243 Mr. Tim:
244      You too are a victim of GMAP?  Let me guess, Olsen's class (or what 
245 little remains of it). If that's the case, did you ever get your linked
246 list problem solved?  I've been trying to get help since monday, but
247 last night Olsen called and said she
248 had yet to take a look at it.  It's not us, its the instructors who
249 are Brain damaged.
250 
251 Deb: I'm not into sports because I'm not into physical pain.
252 I'm the type who feels out to the mail box and back is more than enough
253 exercise for anyone.  However, my hand-eye coordination is fairly
254 good (but then again, I play alot of pinball -- not video games, but
255 real pinball).
256 
261      Did any SCA people out there go to the south sound torney? It was the
262 first event I'd ever gone to, and I was wondering if I met any of
263 you without knowing it.

266 FOTI & JONATHAN CHANCE (& anyone else involved in the Physics argument)
267 	Pick up the March 84 issue of Astronomy magazine, it has an article 
268 called "The Planck Era" (p 66). It deals with current theory regarding the
269 Big Bang. A quote from the article:
270 	Several recent studies by physicists Edward Tryon of Hunter College, R. Brout,
271 F. Englert, and E. Gunzig of the University of Brussels, and David Atkatz and
272 Heinz Pagels of Rockefeller University have shed additional light on the Big
273 Bang. Imagine, if you can, nothing at all -- this is the primordial vacuum of
274 space. There is complete darkness here; no light yet exists. The number of
275 dimensions to space was probably not the normal three that we are so accustomed
276 to, and may have been as high as 11. In this infinite emptiness, random
277 fluctuations in the very geometry of space ever so slightly changed the energy 
278 of the vacuum at various points. Eventually, one of these fluctuations attained 
279 a critical energy and began to grow. As it grew, the massive leptoquarks and 
280 anti-leptoquark particles were created; expansion accelerated, creating still
281 more leptoquarks. This furious cycle continued until, at long last, the
282 leptoquarks decayed into quarks, leptons (particles like electrons and muons, 
283 for example), and their anti-particles. Thus the universe emerged from the
284 Planck Era, 10^-43 second after its birth. Particle creation stopped once the
285 fluctuations in the geometry of space subsided.
286 _____________________________________Leonard____________________________________

290 	"Hairy Fishnuts? Ah, yes.... I believe they go around chanting
291 something like: Harry Kirschner, Harvey Rammer?" said the bard. As he spoke he
292 reached into his pouch and removed a length of red cord. As the conversation 
293 continued he wrapped it about his hands and then unwrapped it again, as if by
294 unconscious habit.
295 	"I would hear more of this....."

352      "But wait.", Nila cried. "Can't you help me in my search? I'm
353      looking for The Place Where East Begins."
354   
355      "I've already helped you.", said the frog. "I told you and I
356      showed you. What do you expect from a frog?"
357   
358      "But can't you even give me a clue? I'm sorry I don't understand,
359      truly I am. Every thing here confuses me and I don't think I
360      should be so confused at The Fountain of Truth."
361   
362      "Fountain of truth? Fountain of Truth!", the frog exclaimed."But
363      this is just the fountain, where I live you know. I call it frog
364      fountain. You drink it's water and your thirst is quenched. 
365      That's the only truth to be found here."
366   
367      "But what do you mean?", Nila asked. "Please Sir Frog..."
368   
369      "Frogs just mean frogs princess. Has anyone ever told you that
370      you have a very short memory?" And with a great plop he leaped
371      into the fountain. Instantly his green skin disappeared in
372      the green water and Nila could no longer see where was frog
373      and where was water.
374      Well, thought Nila, he wasn't much help for a magic frog.
375      Everything had led her to expect quite a lot from magic frogs
376      and she was a little disappointed. She sighed and looked
377      eastward at the rising sun, still close to the horizon. There
378      had to be some place over there where East began but she
379      couldn't guess how terribly far it might be. The edge of the
380      world probably and she wasn't truly sure she wanted to walk
381      that far. It seemed such a long way.
382   
383      The sun's warmth was bringing out the scent of flowers and she
384      heard the faint sound of bees seeking nectar.

419 planet to be on.  I still think it's the best planet I've ever been to.

421 Deb: I'm not into playing sports and I'm not too keen on watching them either.
422 But I'm not an anti-sports person.

500 KUSOO!  I surmise that I have missed a disk!  (Pardon the use of a five
501 letter Japanese word in lieu of the English four letter equivalent.)
502 It seems that things have picked up a bt since my last visit.  
503 
504 I am curious as to the initial responses to my (anti)religious discussion
505 as well as that regarding parental discretion wrt sexual freedom.  I real-
506 that both of these viewpoints are largely "unamerican".
507 
508 Bo:  One of the advantages of a BBS is that it affords the user the oppor-
509 tunity to be brutally honest without fear of offence to his ideological
510 opponents, provided that he does not, in the process of expressing his 
511 opinion, become abusive.  Further, I mintain that any subject, religion
512 or whatever may be discussed in a civilized mannner, particularly when
513 there is time to consider ones words before putting them forth.  After 
514 reading this board I have at times been amazed, astounded, bewildered and
515 sometimes even perturbed; but never offended.  Regarding 66/40, I deeply
516 sympathize.  I too have been a victim of the "Olsen syndrome".  There are
517 three steps to successful completion of said class:
518 1)  NEVER disagree with instructor.
519 2)  NEVER write a better program than instructors.
520 3)  Buy her a case of gin.  (This has the added advantage of resulting
521     in her absence for a few days.)
522 Even more frustrating than the instructor is the realization that the 66/40
523 is an antique and that in practical terms, GMAP is totally useless aside
524 from its similarities to other assemblers.  If you are disappointed with
525 Olsen and if you are a CS major, I have even more depressing news.  You
526 have yet to encounter "Miss Piggy".  Oh well, cheer up! For upper level
527 classes you will at least have access to a relatively decent (VAX) system.
528 I was stuck with Honeywell, Harris and a few other such systems that PSU
529 picked up at Goodwill.
530 
531 Deb:  I believe the key point which has not yet been emphacised regarding
532 your arguement on previous disk is your use of the word "SEEMINGLY".
533 That which "seems" to one might "seem not" to another.  Whether or not 
534 something "seems" depends much more on the "seemee" than on fact.  It 
535 also appears that you are contending that energy is nothing; and as "Me"
536 pointed out, that that which cannot be seen does not exist.  I do not say
537 "God does not exist because I cannot see him/her/it/them/etc.", nor do I
538 even say "God does not exist."  Indeed, I believe that god does exsist.
539 The very fact of its conceivability is evidence that it does exist in the
540 mind of those who conceive it.  This is not to say that it is as it is 
541 conceived, but rather that it is in itself  a conception, or a collection
542 thereof.  I believe that proponents of both sides of this discussion, 
543 including myself, have upon occassion, dealt with abstractions as though
544 they were fact.  "Good", "evil", "right", "wrong", "proof", "existence" 
545 and in my opinion "god" are examples of such abstractions.
546 
547 J. Chance:  You have repeated the standard argument for the existence of
548 a deity; that it need not restrict itself to the physical laws with which
549 we are familiar, therefore explaining the lack of physical evidense in its
550 favor.  The same arguments could be made of Apollo, Hotei, Superman or any
551 of the other deities/superbeings humankind has abstracted throughout its
552 history.  Regarding religiously inspired murder, you are again dealing
553 with an abstraction when you ask "Is that right?".  That which is right,
554 is that which society defines to be "right."  If we define species pre-
555 servation to be "right" then, clearly, murder of any kind is not right.
556 
557 TMA:  I don't answer all my mail, but I do read it all, and I have yet to
558 receive any from God.
559 
560 Leonard:  Congratulations!  I believe you are catching on to a point which
561 I made long ago; that nothing is provable or disprovable, because proof
562 is an abstraction.  Unfortunately, the fact that something cannot be proven
563 is not sufficient cause to believe that it exists.  Therefore my belief
564 that a deity does not exist, is based largely on my assumption that 
565 "nothingness" is the simplest possible state and existence is a disturbance
566 thereof; and, ergo, that there are many more human conceptions that do 
567 not exist beyond that realm than otherwise.  Thus, statistically speaking,
568 unless evidence indicates otherwise, the probability of something existing
569 beyond the realm of conceptualization is infinitessimal.  Perhaps there is 
570 hope!
571 
572 FOTI:  Of what doest thou speaketh?
573 
574 Walrus:  Enlightenment is a journey upon which I surmise you have already
575 embarked.  (Perhaps I should consider the fortune cookie business.)
576 
577 Mr. Tim:  My condolences to you too regarding 66/40.
578

583 
NOVA WILL BE REPEATED ON SUNDAY AT 6:00 FOR THOSE INTERESTED
584 
IT IS AN EXCELLENT, THOUGH ELEMENTARY, INTRODUCTION TO
585 
THIME (THE EXISTENCE OR NOEXISTENSE THEREOF), AND FROM THE WAY IT IS
586 
PRESENTED, DUDLEY MOORE IS THE NATURAL FOR THE PROGRAM, DON'T LET
587 
THIS PUT YOU OFF THOUGH. (CHECK THE TIME, I AM NOT 100% SURE OF IT)
588 

589 
ON THE RELIGION ARGUMENT (RELIGIOUS MURDER, ETC.). MY BELIEF IS THAT
590 
YOU (EMPHASIZE YOU) CAN BELEIVE ANYTHING YOU WANT JUST SO LONG AS YOU 
591 
DONT FORCE IT ON ANYONE ELSE (ESPECAILLY THOSE UNABLE TO KNOW ALL THE
592 
FACTS OR UNDERSTAND THEM). THOUGH DISCUSSING VEIWS IN A SITUATION SUCH
593 
AS THIS IS GREAT.
594 

595 
AS FOR THE ARGUMENT ON EXISTENCE, I THINK I'LL STAY OUT OF THAT ONE 
596 
... FOR NOW.
599 
===================
602 
   A YOUNG LEAN MAN SITTING AT A NEARBY TABLE GETS UP AND STEPS 
603 
UP TO THE TABLE AT WHICH THE ADVENTURERS ARE SITTING.
604 
  "I COULD'NT HELP OVERHEARING THE YOUR CONVERSATION, NOT TO
605 
MENTION DODGING THE FLYING GLASS. BUT DO YOU HAVE NEED IN YOUR PARTY
606 
OF ONE SUCH AS MYSELF. I AM FROM, OF ALL MUNDANE PLACES, THE LATE 
607 
TWENTIETH CENTURY, BUT AM WIDLEY TRAVVELLED. I BELIVE YOU COULD USE MY
608 
MEAGER ABILITIES, OR MY GUN, A COLT .45 I CHECKED AT THE DOOR."

623 Man In Gray:  The people destroying this
624 world are , in my opinion, the
625 ones who take it for grantid.  But, I also think that
626 a few jackasses like Reagen could use a good
627 termination.  The earth wont't continue to exist if people like him with 
628 their ideas of more weapons willi insure peace, continue to rule powerful 
629 nations.  Tron:  I think I know who you are initials CB?   FOTI
