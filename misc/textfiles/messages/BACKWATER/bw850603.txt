7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privately owned

9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system. As the system is
10 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
11 I may find offensive. Because of the limited size of the system, it will be

20 TO ALL USERS: Some of you probably have been experiencing difficulty getting
21 onto BW of late (nothing but busy signals) and then when you do get on, 
22 nothing but garbage on the line. Well, the old phone line problem is back,
23 sigh... it seems to appear mostly when it rains. I will be pulling BW off line
24 today (4 June) and I am putting a nice cozy 'normal' telephone on for the
25 phone repairman so that he will have something familar to see when he tries
26 to fix the line. I don't have an enormous amount of hope, but maybe if the
27 rain holds out, and the phone guy is marginaly above average, and I'm lucky,
28 maybe, just maybe they'll find the problem. We'll see.

38 Nice to see you on DB, Doctor.  It's comforting to note that familiar faces
39 are hiding in the shadows, and nothing else.  Pity you couldn't have entered
40 a little story, though... Episode 3 of mine coming soon (Now where did I put 
41 my quill?).

58 Late at night and all alone on the hoot-owl. An idea sticks
59 in my puny brian. 'Gosh, why do people find it so real
60 important to be at the top?  Like gee, what's the big fuss?
61 Maybe I don't know 'cause I haven't been there before. Wow, 
62 this really and truly deserves to be fully thunk out with
63 some nice cold colas!'
64 The kid then went on to go to the 7-eleven store next door.
65 Just one problem, he doesn't live next to that store anymore.
66 What will he do now? The sane world may never know.....

70 CISTOP: TELL ME ABOUT LINE NOISE. I IS THE MAIN REASON I CANNOT GET ON 
71 BEFORE 1 A.M. THE STRANGE THING IS, WHILE I GET GARBAGE ON MY END, THE 
72 OTHER SIDE SEEMS TO RECIEVE ME PERFECTLY. GO FIGURE IT. IF YOUR LINEMAN
73 DOES FIND THE PROBLEM, I WOULD BE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT IT
74 IS. MAYBE I CAN GET THE SAME THING DONE TO MINE (VERY IMPORTANT IF I HOPE
75 TO GET MY OWN BBS UP SOMEDAY MAYBE SOON)
76 ALSO, WHAT DOES "MARGIN IS 77" AND "STATUS: ALL ALLOWED" MEAN? I'VE BEEN 
77 FOLLOWING THIS BOARD DAILY SINCE I FIRST GOT MY MODEM A MONTH AGO BUT
78 THERE ARE STILL THINGS I HAVE YET TO PICK UP ON.
79 AND, IF ANYBODY'S INTERESTED, I JUST STARTED A NEW STORY OVER ON TANIS.
80 I THINK I'LL GO BACK INTO LURK MODE NOW AS I SOUND MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT
81 WITH MY MOUTH SHUT. TAKE CARE.

85   Many strange sights have been seen in the deep forest.  There, far
86 from the sight of man, reality is shaped by the relentless vegetable
87 pressure of the forest; its relentless reach for light, moisture, and
88 nutrients.  Where a break occurs in the forest canopy, this competition
89 breaks into open warfare.  Moving at blinding speed (given the pace of
90 vegatative motion) plants thrust, advance, fall back, and shrivel in
91 defeat.  Others win pyrrhic victories and fall over the corpses of their
92 enimies even as the eventual victors who have husbanded their resources
93 make the final leap for the sky and close the canopy of the climax forest.
94   The web of animal life is tenuous in the forest.  On the forest floor,
95 there is little vegetation for the browser; only at the occasional clearing
96 where vegetable warfare is at its fiercest can the herbivores of the forest
97 find their vegetable prey.  Here, also, come the carnivores of the forest;
98 the next step in the food chain.  From the tiny shrew, scarce a quarter-ounce
99 of venom and speed attacking prey larger than itself, to a lumbering, 
100 silver-tipped bear weighing many hundreds of pounds -- more an omnivore than
101 a carnivore -- the carnivores hunt the meadows and openings in the forest
102 canopy.
103   Here, in the silvery light of the pre-dawn sky, a sharp-eyed observer might
104 have seen an introduction -- a meeting of two different species.  Had the
105 observer been closer, close enough to look into the eyes of the two-legged
106 species, the observer might well have drawn back at the pain and lonliness
107 etched there.  Standing briefly at the edge of the clearing, the two-legged
108 figure was jostled by a silent grey shadow and moved off into the forest.

118 FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO KNOW THE END RESULT OF THE PHONE PROBLEM,
119 THERE ISN'T ONE, THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE SIGH.....

121 "IT LOOKS OK TO ME, CALL AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM."
122 
123 ARGHHHHH! I'VE BEEN DOING THAT SINCE THE FIRST OF THE YEAR FOR
124 CHRIST'S SAKE! I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT ABOUT THE ONLY WAY
125 I'M GOING TO GET THIS FIXED IS TO MOVE!

129 Mikey: I just got on after getting nothing but ring, ring... for several hours.
130 Was this the line problem or something else?
131   Also, I may need to pick up a couple of 2114 ram chips. Any ideas where I can
132 find them. (I'm not even sure what KIND of ram they are, all the docs for the 
133 gizmo say is "Uxx 2114 RAM"... I need some good ones to replace some flakey
134 chips (for reasons too complicated to go into here, I can NOT just run a RAM
135 test..
136   One more thing Are the archive disks $5 each? If not how much are they?

159 Leonard:2114's are 1k x 4 Static Rams (being static ewe wont see them breed (
160 sorry; couldn't resist)).  they come in a veriety of speed and power ratings;
161 the L suffix denotes low power while the -4 = 450 nano's, -3= 300 et.c.
162 Norvac out in bevertown would have them for sure while portland radio (near 
163 powel's books) will charge the inflated Jim-pak price if they have them.  I 
164 also seem to recall radio-schlock having carried one version of them at one 
165 time.  If your widgit doesn't run faster than 1 meg and has +5 to spare, any
166 2114 should work.  If ps is 'on its ragged edge; the 'L' suffix is indicated
167  and the -x is dictated by the system clock.

170 *********************************************************************
171 LEONARD: THE DISKS ARE INDEED $5 EACH MSDOS FORMAT 6 BW FILES PER
172 MSDOS DISK. AS FOR THE 2114, I'LL BRING A COUPLE WITH ME THRUSDAY
173 IF YOU WANT EM, JUST GIVE ME A COUPLE OF BUCKS. THEY ARE 450NS
174 STANDARD POWER TYPES. THE SAME ONES USED FOR BW'S MEMORY. I'LL ALSO
175 BRING SPECS WHICH YOU CAN KEEP WHETHER YOU WANT THE CHIPS OR NOT.
176 FLAKY 2114'S? I'VE HAD LOTS OF BUM ONES, BUT FLAKY? I'VE SELDOM NOT
177 HAD A MEMORY TEST NOT CATCH THE BAD ONES. 
178 
179 AS FAR AS THE PHONE THING GOES, I DIDN'T GET HOME UNTIL 11PM LAST NIGHT,
180 AND AS PER MY FIRST MESSAGE ON THIS DISK, BW WAS OFF LINE TO GIVE THE
181 PHONE REPAIRMAN A NICE COZY 'STANDARD' PHONE TO SEE ON THE LINE. I THINK
182 HE MAY HAVE BEEN CHECKING THE WRONG LINE THOUGH IF HE SAW AN OPEN,
183 CAUSE WHEN I CHECKED IT WHEN I GOT HOME, I GOT DIAL TONE WHEN I LIFTED THE
184 RECEIVER, WHICH TELLS ME THAT IT WAS ON THE LINE. A NEVER ENDING
185 BATTLE I'M AFRAID.
186 
187 P. ABBUS: AS PER MY FIRST MESSAGE ON THE DISK, THE PROBLEM IS WATER GETTING
188 INTO THE LINE SOMEPLACE AND SHORTING THINGS OUT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE
189 PHONE REPAIRMAN WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT UNLESS THERE IS A CONSTANT PROBLEM
190 THAT HE CAN CHECK AGAINST. THUS THE "CALL ME WHEN YOU HAVE A 'REAL' PROBLEM"
191 RESPONSE. THUS MY REASON FOR BEING TICKED OFF, AND UPSET BECAUSE I'M
192 PAYING FOR A LINE THAT ISN'T WORKING CORRECTLY AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX IT
193 OR EVEN ADMIT THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM.

217 S         Greetings, friend huamans,. Sranul the roo has hopped up to Backwater . It took me a while, but I am finally
218 here for good. I sincerely haope that I'll be as well accepted as I am on TANIS and T.A.W.! I love this system. There
219 TO:  ANYONE OUT THERE

222 8ACICFP<8ACICFP<8ACICFP<8ACICFP<8ACICFP<8ACICFP<8ACICFP<8ACICFP<8ACICFP<
223 	didn't there used to be a space somewhere in my border?
224 	CISTOP, what have you changed I can no longer get my border using a
225 couple of strange keys that exist on my keyboard, you echo back exactly what
226 they should be instead of ASCII recognized characters.  Maybe it's me.???
227 	Oh well, at any rate :  heres some more, hope you can still withstand
228 my entries.

230 on the first day of the first month
231 in some distant year
232 the whole sky froze golden
233 some said it was the aftermath
234 of the radium bomb
235 while others told of a final retribution
236 a terrible revenge of the godz
237 
238 but we understood it was the grand finale
239 fulfillment of a prophesy told many years before
240 so all that was left was -
241 
242 all the women were captured and chained
243 and national suicide was proclaimed
244 and new america fell to the ground
245 and all the children lay crippled and lame
246 
247 but all the nations came togeather
248 in fear at the thought of the end
249 no more would we fihgt in the streets
250 no courage had we to defend
251 
252 a blinding light the sun had died
253 a new moon took it's place
254 tidal waves, open graves the fate of the human race
255 the city heart no longer beats no pity have i left to lend
256 a sinnner sits reciting Dylan it's now that i welcome the end.

296 Mikey: No bugs as far as VT100 emulation coming in, but I think I am having some problems on the keypad operation.
297  It is too complicated to get into here, I will bring the manual and my notes Thursday, and we can discuss it there.
298  Remember I won't be arriving until sometime after 9:30 (It's my second to last class of the term! But then comes
299  finals...) Will you have archive disks with you? I think the last batch we got were in FEB or MAR.
300 Farley: San Francisco is going to have to wait until at least this weekend. My wordprocessor has been heating up but
301  unfortunately it hasn't been for BW, rather Eng399, WR407, Eng201, and Eng410k. But! My typing is sure
302  getting better.
303 Mikey again: I have a new copy of SUB.EXE. It turns out the version you have isn't getting the full range of safe
304  combinations that I calculate off the clock. Whoops! I will bring a 'zapped' version Thursday.

329 8ACICFP<  -- THE BACKWATER CODE HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED SINCE 1982,

336 LEONARD: I WON'T BE ABLE TO GET THE DISK TO YOU THIS TIME, N
337 ENOUGH TIME TO GET IT CONVERTED. CURRENTLY THE FIRST 50 ARCHIVE
338 DISKS ARE ON 8" DISKS WHICH REQUIRES THAT I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD TO
339 MSDOS. THIS IS A PROBLEM SINCE MY 8" SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY IN USE
340 AT WORK AS A CUSTOMER DATABASE MACHINE. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT
341 THE EARLY ARCHIVES BEING ON EIGHT INCH DISKS AND GIVEN THE METHOD
342 OF ARCHIVING MAY NOT BE 6 FILES PER DISK. SOME ONLY HAVE 5 BW FILES,
343 AND OTHERS HAVE 7 BW FILES. SINCE IT IS *VERY* TIME CONSUMING TO
344 SHUFFLE FILES AROUND, I'M ONLY WILLING TO SELL A STRAIGHT COPY.
345 IF YOU REALLY NEED THE OTHER FILES, SUGGEST YOU GET THE NEXT DISK IN
346 THE SEQUENCE. I'M  NOT TRYING TO BE NASTY ABOUT IT, ONLY THAT IT 
347 TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO SHUFFLE THAT STUFF AROUND, AND RIGHT NOW 
348 MY TIME IS IN EXTREMLY SHORT SUPPLY, SO I JUST CAN'T AFORD TO
349 SPEND A LOT OF IT ON THESE SORT OF ACTIVITIES. 
350 AHH, AN ELECTRIC CRAYON BOX.. AS I REMEMBER, I DON'T THINK IT CARED

353 TO DESIGN WITH ALONG WITH THE Z80 CPU. FROM '82 TO '84 IT WAS 4164S
354 AND 8088S. NOW ITS 41256S AND 68020S. TIMES CHANGE....
355 
356 MAX: AS I'VE SAID BEFORE, THE PROBLEM IS WATER SHORTING THINGS OUT
357 SOMEPLACE, AND NOT CORODED CONNECTIONS.

362 Lenonard,  Are the RAM's socketed?? If the problem is flakey, it might 
363 be loose parts (heating up an cooling down can sometimes loosen parts).
364 It seems strange that a whole bank would be flakey...

382 The tide rises, the tide falls,
383 The twilight darkens, the curlew calls.
384 Along the sea-sands damp and brown
385 the traveller hastens toward the town,
386 And the tide rises, the tide falls.
387 
388 Darkness settles on roofsand walls,
389 But the sea, the sea in the darkness calls.
390 The little waves, with their soft, white hands,
391 Efface the footprints in the sands,
392 And the tide rises, the tide falls.
393 
394 The morning breaks. The steeds in their stalls
395 Stamp and neigh, as the hostler calls.
396 The day returns, but nevermore
397 Returns the traveller to the shore,
398 And the tide rises, the tide falls.

493 Run, don't walk to the Movie House Theater at 1220 SW Taylor. Currently
494 showing are two of the finest films I have seen in some time. The first
495 is 'the family game.' It was written and directed by Yoshimitsu Morita.
496 As you might guess it is a Japanese film, but the sub-titles are nicely
497 done. The fact that the story takes place  in a  country  that  is very
498 much different than our own does not detract from this film at all.  It
499 is a beautiful testimonial to family life.  The  other film, a bit more
500 straightforward in its appeal, but still a real joy, is 'Heartbreakers'
501 Ted Mahar reviewed this film recently in the oRAGonian, and who am I to
502 go against what the great Ted said about the film,even though he missed
503 the boat at several places. Tangerine Dream fans   will be glad to know
504 that the music is excellent in all the right places. 'Heartbreakers' is
505 an indepth and sometimes comical look into the lives  and  loves of two
506 men from very different backgrounds heading in very different directions.
507 The films end Thursday. The rating is R (for Heartbreakers). See them
508 if you can!

519   Inside a forgotten shoe box lies a small crumpled form, together with some 
520 bits of string and some short peices of flat wood.  The box lies at the back of
521 a little used closet, not yet covered with dust.
522   I have thought about that box for some time know, its image coming to me at 
523 odd times.  Perhaps it would be a step backwards to wake it from its dark
524 slumber.
525 
526   But perhaps I was not ready for the step ahead.
527 
528   For some reason I find myself looking blankly at my jacket, thinking of the
529 toothbrush that is still in the pocket.

533 more poetry...
534 
535 I took a walk the other day
536 	Saw much in passing
537 A clear and crystal pond along the way.
538 
539 Such beauty and clear depth
540 	The purity promised there
541 Gladdened this heart of mine.
542 
543 The pond was such a sight to see
544 	It brought forth and made bare
545 That hidden part, the real me.
546 
547 As I stood and gazed in wonder
548 	An urge to touch, to taste came over me
549 Closer I saw all there was to see
550 	The surface - all there was
551 A picture in a frame.
552 
553 The loss I felt
554 	At what was not beneath
555 Compelled me to see
556 	My days a little differently.
557 
558 I remember that pond
559 	It comes to me as new journies begin
560 I hope memory weakens in time
561 	I don't want to pass that way again.
