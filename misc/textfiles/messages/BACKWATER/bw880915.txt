 40      All righT! A new Disk! Well all, lets see. Hmm. I know, I'll enter the
 41 next part in the continuiing adventures of John Eddison, Inter Dimensional
 42 police Officer!
 43  
 44      (When we last left our adventurer he was drunk out of his mind and flying
 45 blindly through the space time continue. The brownie was gone, Will he return?)
 46   
 47      John Eddison came slowly back to reality. (Or what ever passed for reality
 48 in this fractured place.) His head ached and his body throbed. Or perhaps it
 49 was his head that throbed and his body that ached.
 50  
 51      The space all around him was a dull gray. Instantly he knew that he had
 52 somehow ded up in the Inter Dimensional ether. Sh*t!, Ouch!! he said feeling
 53 the effects of his over indulgence.
 54  
 55      He took a moment or two to let things stabilize a bit. on the Panel of
 56 his tub a red light was flashing. He moved slowly forward and flicked the 
 57 switch that was set beside it.
 58  
 59      "Eddison? Are you there?" The chief said from the speaker above the switch
 60 and up and to the right of the light.
 61  
 62      "Chief! Ah, is there a problem?"
 63  
 64      "Yes theirs a problem. I'm going to have to call you back from vacation."
 65  
 66      "It's not the destruction of the Universe again is it?"
 67  
 68      "No, we used that plot last time. We'll have to wait awhile before we
 69 can get away with it again. Anyway, the Author has come up with a new story
 70 line."
 71  
 72      "Good, I was getting sick..."
 73  
 74      "Eddison! Pay attention."
 75  
 76      "Yes sir!"
 77   
 78      "Good, Now I want you to proccede to the coordanites now flashing on the

 81      "Ok, then what?"
 82  
 83      "You'll be getting orders on your arival."
 84    
 85      "Ready willing and able sir!"
 86  
 87      "Eddison, have you been drinking again?"
 88  
 89      "Only a little."

 91      "I thought so. Get to work man."

251                          AMERICANS SPYING ON AMERICANS
252  
253           The Reagan administration's paranoid concern with communism has
254      led to the development of a national private spying network and an
255      official effort by the FBI to turn America's librarians into spies.
256           People and groups who speak out against Reagan adminstration
257      policies put themselves in jeopardy of surveillance by private
258      intelligence-gathering organizations composed of conservative groups
259      with close ties to the White House. Members say they pass on the
260      information they collect to federal agencies, like the Justice
261      Department, and on occasion to the White House itself.
262           Conservative groups involved in these spying activities include
263      the Institute for Contemporary Studies, the Young America's
264      Foundation, the Council for Inter-American Security, and the Capital
265      Research Center.
266           Stephen Schwartz works at the Institute for Contemporary Studies,
267      a San Francisco think-tank founded by top Reagan aides like Ed Meese.
268      Schwartz calls it "the commie-watching network."
269           Michael Boos, Program Director of Young America's Foundation,
270      says the group promotes conservative ideas on college campuses .. and
271      keeps track of what the left-wing opposition is up to.  Boos keeps
272      files, makes lists, takes photographs ... all to keep an eye on
273      students and professors he says "need watching."  Boos says that two
274      top-level Reagan Adminstration officials -- Ken Cribb, Assistant to
275      the President for Domestic Affairs, and Frank Donatelli, the
276      President's chief Political Advisor -- support his work. Both serve on
277      Young America's Board of Directors. Young America's financial records
278      reveal the oganization received money from the federal government --
279      over $100,000 from the United States Information Agency.
280           Michael Waller gathers information on left-wing activists for a
281      private political group called the Council for Inter-American
282      Security. The Council claims that Bill Casey was driven to have a
283      brain seizure because of harassment by the liberal media and liberal
284      members of Congress. It also claims that Michigan Congressman George
285      Crockett was once a communist agent and that other congressmen who
286      secretly collaborated with the Soviet KGB included John Burton, Ted
287      Weiss, Ron Dellums, John Conyers, Don Edwards, and Charles Rangle.
288           Willa Johnson, who heads the Capital Research Center which
289      gathers information on}i opponents of White House policies, is former
290      Deputy Director of Personnel at the White House. The Center gets its
291      money from corporations and right-wing benefactors like Joe Coors and
292      Ellen Garwood, two key funders of the secret White House effort to
293      support the contras.
294           Meanwhile, the FBI officially recruits librarians to spy on
295      library users who might be diplomats of hostile powers recruiting
296      intellnence agents or gathering information potentially harmful to
297      U.S. security. While the current program, euphemistically called the
298      "Library Awareness Program," started shortly after the August, 1986,
299      arrest of a Soviet spy who frequented New York Libraries in search of
300 y     student recruits and stolen, unclassified library materials, the xDFBI
301      said the program has existed for years in various incarnations.

332              REAGAN'S 1980 "OCTOBER SURPRISE" -- ARMS FOR HOSTAGES
333  
334           In October 1980, nothing worried the Reagan campaign as much as
335      the possibility that the 52 hostages held by Iran might come home.
336      A "paramilitary wing" created by Reagan's campaign staff to prevent
337      such a possibility was largely unreported in 1987.
338           The revelations report that then campaign manager William J.
339      Casey headed an "October surprise" team engaging the services of both
340      retired and active military personnel.
341           During the course of the 1980 campaign, campaign leaders Richard
342      Allen, Edwin Meese, and Casey became concerned, almost to the point of
343      paranoia (according to journalists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover)
344      that Carter would get the hostages released thereby stealing away
345      Reagan's election momentum and assuring Carter of re-election.
346           Following is a brief overview of the reported activities of
347      Reagan's "October 1980 surprise" team:
348           Various reports reveal that Casey's "paramilitary wing"
349      monitored U.S. military movements for the Reagan campaign, met with
350      representatives of the Bani-Sadr government of Iran, and covertly
351      obtained President Carter's debate briefing materials prior to the
352      November election.
353           These revelations alone carry enormous constitutional
354      implications -- private citizens soliciting military and intelligence
355      assistance in monitoring U.S. government operations, private citizens
356      meeting with foreign dignitaries in possible state negotiations, and
357      private citizens clandestinely obtaining property of the United States
358      President -- and yet they were not followed up by the major media once
359      discovered and revealed in small, non-mass media publications.
360           Even more disturbing is the issue of Iranian arms shipments.
361      Documents confirm that within its first month, the Reagan
362      administration gave a green light to Israel to resume its arms
363      shipments to the Iranian government.
364           These revelations support former Iranian President Bani-Sadr's
365      assertion that the arms supply contract Iran signed with Israel in
366      March 1981, less than two months after Reagan's inauguration, was the
367      payoff for delaying the release of the American hostages until after
368      the November 4, 1980 election.
369           The hostages remained in captivity until January 20, 1981, the
370      day Reagan took the oath of office, and they left Teheran minutes
371      after he became president.
372           A conspiracy between a presidential candidate and a hostile
373      foreign power against an incumbent president would seem to be without
374      precedent in American history. At the very least, it would seem that
375      the documented charges revealed by a few journalists last year
376      deserved to be investigated for the benefit of the American public by
377      the U.S. media.

508    At first, there was nothing.
509  
510    Then, after the blinding light passed, a space formed.  It was
511 small, eratic sphere, but none the less, a space.  It expanded in
512 Beta-Space, becoming smoother and more regular with time, like a
513 nuclear warhead in real space.  Then, visible light dimmed into the
514 vast, dark area.  In the middle was something not quite a man, and
515 not quite a child.  Exactly 20 years of age on September 21st, 1988,
516 he "floated" in the exact center of this 100-meter wide sphere.  An
517 atmosphere formed around the orange-robed subject.  The not-quite-
518 but-almost a man ended the meditation, and opened his eyes.  Before
519 him was a phone wire that had neatly snapped at one of the connecting

684 Renee, It could be wurd-rap or possibly whord whrap?
685 Generally speaking though, I wouldsay that it is still a new enough
686 term that the words shouldbe kept seperate "word wrap." One the other han
687 it is appraoching the point where it is a generic term describing a
688 specific action which means that perhaps it should be used with a hyphen
689 "word-wrap." Personaly I have yet to see a valid rule by which two word
690 are concatinated into one. There is jut the general rule that if the ter
691 gets used enough that it can be connected via the hyphen indicating that
692 it is a singular expression describing something. Then at some point people
693 just start dropping the hyphen altogether. This seems to happen after the 
694 expression becomes considered a common term. Yet sometimes the hyphen is
695 never dropped, and other times the hyphen stage is bypassed altogether. 
696 What a wonderful language English is. Even the English can't make sense of i!

718  
719 About organizations of hate. It is sad that peaple feel the need to hate others
721  
722 . I beleieve that perhaps it is some sort of defect that allows them to blame
723 all of their problems on others. It is best to remember that we should not
724 be in compatition with each other. I don't think there is anyone out thear
725 that can effectivly compete with themselves, let alone anyone else.

729 NEVER EXTERNALIZE YOUR PROBLEMS. This may sound harsh, but I believe in it.
730 This is not to say that others might not cause you problems. What it means is 
731 take responsability for your actions. If you screw up, admit it and learn from
732 it.
733  
734 My brother once told me that if you admit you are wrong you are showing a 
735 weakness. I told him he was dead wrong, But I don't think he listened to me.
736  
737 Thus he is a High School drop out, And I am now a College senior. It is ironic
738 that he is probably the smarter one.
739  
740 Never simplify the world. It is stupid. The world is so complex that you can't
741 even beging t emagine the barest and most trivial details. 
742  
743 This is not somthing to be depressed about. We are all in the same boat, and I
744 suspect that if we actually knew how the world worked we would not be happy.
745  
746 I'm sorry if I seem to be rambling. It is just that I have strong feelings 
747 about the whole racist attitude. It is wrong, DEAD wrong. Unfortunetly,
748 some peaple have this tendancy to bd DEAD wrong.

791 Never forget that hate itself is a valid emotion, and to wipe it from the
792 human mind would be as foolish as to destroy love.  All our emotions are 
793 based on what was needed for survival in times before we were our own 
794 enemy.  Hate still has its place, it is only when it is used in an anti
795 human survival type way that it becomes a threat to us all.

820 Actually, nothing. The national socialist party was a valid one once, so
821 being a Nazi' wasn't bad in itself. It's just what the Nazi's did that 
822 makes them so repugnant. Remember, any movement with racists in it is

842    Nice to see that some people have not been as sloth as I.  Yes, to
843 eradicate xate0is to also remove love - because, like Good and Evil,
844 they are deifined in terms of each other.  This doesn't mean that you
845 can't escape from Good and Evil, but if you should wish to be neither,
846 you must start a new game (and write youb0own0rules).  Nicely put,
847 Dreamer!  It makes me feel 'good' to know that others out there understand
848 the only problem really left in the world: OURSELVES.  Despite many
849 attempts on my part, people still tend to act in 'programmed' and
850 7entxinking' ways, that is, they "Know not what they do" (to borrow
851 a phrase from a famous religious figure).  There's nothing wrong with
852 the earth.  It could be paradise.  It could be everything that everyone
853 ever wanted (whew! too many everc)  But people CHOOSE to not understand
854 that we are all dependent upon each other, and (forgive me, Robert Shea)
855 rather than knock down the walls of our tiny shared hut (called Mother
856 Earth), we take the easier and more ignorant route of starvinw, killing,
857 or evicting the other occupants to make room for ourselves.  Whenever
858 I meet a person who seems to hold promise, I carefully talk with them
859 about who they are (in essence, how they percieve the world), and
860 despite obvioes ant blatant double standards in their beliefs, they
861 still hold strong to their values.  I do not wish to 'convert' or
862 'control' a person's religious or political beliefs.  I simply want
863 to make the person aware of what really, undeniably,0is xere on
864 Earth, before their own eyes.  I never try to pervert their beliefs;
865 I just want them to awake from their stupor.

871    When he was finished with the cnnecdion, a vision in his mind
872 formed of all the other adventurers, off doing other trival things,
873 along with a fading time stream of a distant battle.  The young man
874 became quite upset; in fact, he was furious!
875  
876    He began his mudidqtion.
877  
878    It continued.  Beta Time quickened to sync with the time flow at
879 the Inn.  Then a portion of the sphere distorted, as that space matched
880 with Earth time.  Soon, several time zones had distorted the sphere into
881 an odt, lumpy figure.
882  
883    His eye open.  The light of the eye drew all into the respective time
884 zones instantaniously.  The multiple portals then closed, in the blink of
885 a dying star's last gasp, as all were returned to beta time-space.
88&  
887    The eye closed.
888  
889    He was tired from the extreme effort, but his anger compelled him
890 to do this.
891  
892    "And what do you think you're doing?", he said in an angry tone to
893 everyone.  "Just because the !$%%$^@#$%!! |ine crapped out on me
894 doesn't mean you should run off!  By the All-Seeing Eye, never have
895 I seen so many who have resorted to making the shrill mouth-music whilst
896 they urinate!  Wake up!  Ok, maybe I am a purist at heart, but I
897 still would uxpect everyone to guide themselves, reguardless of
898 wheather you're fighting a Thermonuclear War or Making Love on a First
899 DATE! (As if there was a difference, ) he thought.  I'm tired.  I become
900 even more tired by the minute.

9 2   0Let's kick some dark-robed nasty-sounding butt.  NOW!
903  
904    And with a clapp of thunder, reverbarating in the tiny atmosphere of
905 Beta-Space, the adventurers vanished in a blinding flash of light.
906  
907    The Orb would be re-claimud by its TRUE owner.
908  
909    John Eddison would be promoted over the slimeball brownie.
910  
911    Kurfur Redlig would recover the Eternal Keg of Spirits.
912  
913    And I would regain my body back.
