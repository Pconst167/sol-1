104 d. - "I can speak directly for God"  He spoke to me in a dream and told
105      me all truth.  Does this make my musings and meanderings the truth?
106      Of course not.  And neither does the christian bible saying the
107      same thing make it so.  The prophecies of Nostradamus also show 
108      much of what is happening to us, and few regard them as absolute
109      truth.  
110      And let us look at just one of the prophecies now coming true, that
111      of wars and rumors of war.  Sure, there is war every where now, but
112      how much of that is new, and how much of it is just *news*?  I 
113      submit that although war has become more destructive, it has not
114      become more prevalent.  We just hear about it more thanks to the 
115      age we are in.  Each generation points to things that say "This 
116      surely is the end times!"  And here we are yet.

121 Capt'n: It's not surprising that the "books" are similar. One of the
122 primary reasons for people to look to religion is to provide an answer
123 to life. Usually exemplafied with the statement "Why am I here?"
124 It is thus only natural that the religions provide the answer. However
125 as Friar pointed out above, stating an answer in a book hardly provides
126 any sort of proof of the existance of God. 
127 d: Profound statements and predictions are hardly the sole property of
128 the bible. These sorts of things can be found in many writings. I've got
129 a book of quotes that has some very profound statements in it about life
130 and humanity. These are not writtings from a God, they are from ordinary
131 people. There is nothing special about seeing life as it is, you only
132 need to open your eyes and see it. It has always been there and always
133 will be.
134 I see that you haven't changed your tune, you still start your arguments
135 with the same old saw. The Bible is the word of God, the bible says that
136 God exists, therefore God exists. That is a very poor circular argument.
137 You would fail logic class should you attempt to use that sort of structure.
138 Because the bible exists in quantity is hardly proof that it is more than
139 it is, a book, it only shows the zealousness of those that push it.
140 There are more IBM PC type personal computers than any other kind. That
141 fact doesn't make it the best computer, nor does it make it God's computer,
142 All it means is that there are more IBM PC style personal computers than
143 any other kind. Any other interperitation of that is mearly speculation
144 and opinion. The same goes for the bible, the quantity mearly describes
145 the quantity, nothing more.

193 that place once again.  The Cougar guardian by day and the Wolf guardian by

197 only.  The ways of the tribe cannot be changed.  The must remain the same
198 inorder for survival to be possible.  At times I feel there is so much to

303   John D. -- Permit me to elucidate on my previous inference,
304    hopfully to clarify its meaning. (Interesting side note: 'd'
305    seems to view me as being totally derisive of religion, while
306    you perhaps perceive me as supportive--- Well, 'balance in all
307    things') The point was that there is 'truth' at the core of most
308    religion. It is this essence that we should nurture and preserve.
309    What we should resist is the tyranny of dogma.
310  
311   Christianity has a benin and harmless aspect, part social guide
312   and part genial bully. People are cajoled into believing they must
313   be born again or belong to something. The other side of Christian
314   activity, for nearly 2000 years, has been to imprison people in a
315   mental straitjacket. Any sort of irreverence or rebellon was
316   severely punished.
317  
318   How has this mental prison affected our thinking? First it causes
319   us to ask the wrong uestions. A classic example is underlying
320   theme of the current backwater discusion, "WHY?" The explorer
321   Richard Burton said, "Abjure the Why and seek the How. (There he
322   goes quoting authoritive sources again!) How? ---- can we as
323   individuals and collectively look at ourselves, and our reflection
324   in the words of others, to gain new insight?

343 Helter Skelter was a song written by the Beatles which Charles Manson Claimed
344 he heard something in it that told him to murder those people.
345 The whole thing was written and performed by the group Kick Axe on their latest

347 of Fleetwood Mac's song "The Chain". It's beautiful. Enjoy.

358   Welcome back, Capt'n!  Forgive me if I came across as an antagonist;
359 I was just ribbing you for the chuckles that spill out between your lines!
360 No matter how serious the subject, you irreverently nudge some fun out of
361 it, not unkindly.  I like that in a man!  Now, I will not "abjure the why"
362 (sounds far too final) but I do "seek the How":  How shall I establish
363 that the Bible stands above other books of "truth," at the same time 
364 satisfying John Dilk's demand for "accepted logic convention"?
365   Simple.  The Bible's strongest evidence of inspiration is prophecy.
366 By this I do not mean vague, sweeping statements such as Nostradamus made.
367 The Bible is filled with prophecies reflecting detailed knowledge of the
368 future--something impossible for humans.
369   The Bible contains hundreds of prophecies.  Have they been accurately
370 fulfilled until now?  If so, it would be a telling indication of the 
371 Bible's being "inspired of God."  And it would create confidence in
372 further prophecies regarding events yet to come.  Hence, it will be
373 useful to review some prophecies already fulfilled.
374   The ancient city Babylon (famed for its great structure of vaulted
375 archways, tier upon tier:  the hanging gardens, "wonder of the world")
376 was located along the Euphrates River, approximately 540 miles east
377 of Jerusalem and some 50 miles south of modern Baghdad.  History records
378 that Babylon took the Jews into captivity.  Yet, about 40 years before 
036=Usr:397 dragon lady       03/24/88 16:53  Msg:1345 Call:9076  Lines:54
379 this happened Jeremiah foretold it.  Isaiah predicted it some 150 years
380 before it happened.  He also foretold that the Jews would return from
381 captivity.  So did Jeremiah, saying that they would be restored to their
382 land after 70 years.--Isaiah 39:6,7; 44:26; Jeremiah 25:8-12; 29:10.
383   How would this return be made possible?  By the overthrowing of Babylon
384 by the Medes and Persians in 539 B.C.E.  Now, to get an idea of how
385 impossible this prophecy sounded, we can reconstruct a fair resemblance
386 of the appearance of Babylon as it stood in Nebuchadnezzar's day.  
387   Historians and archaeologists testify that a system of double walls
388 surrounded the city, the outer wall buttressed by towers.  Streets ran
389 through the city from gates in the massive walls.  Procession Street,
390 the main boulevard, was paved and its walls alongside were decorated
391 with lions, dragons and bulls in symbol of the honoured gods.  According
392 to Herodotus, the great Euphrates River was flanked on either side with
393 a continuous quay, which was separated from the city proper by walls
394 having twenty-five gateways.  This sprawling metropolis astride the 
395 watercourse was a commercial and industrial center of world trade.
396 More than an important manufacturing center, it was a commercial depot
397 for trade between the peoples of the East and the West, both by land
398 and by sea.  Babylon, it is said, had a fleet of three thousand galleys
399 that plied not only the city's canal system but also the great Tigris
400 and Euphrates Rivers.  This means that her fleet had access to the 
401 Persian Gulf and the seas far beyond.
402   Yet its overthrow was foretold by Isaiah nearly 200 years before it
403 happened, and by Jeremiah about 50 years before it occurred.  Jeremiah
404 said that the Babylonian soldiers would put up no fight.  Both Isaiah
405 and Jeremiah foretold that Babylon's protecting waters, the river 
406 Euphrates, "must be dried up."  Isaiah even gave the name of the 
407 conquering Persian general, Cyrus, and said that before him "the gates
408 [of Babylon] will not be shut."--Jeremiah 50:38; 51:11,30; Isaiah 13:
409 17-19; 44:27; 45:1.
410   Again, the setting:  Isaiah's writing was completed by about 732 B.C.E.
411 Cyrus had not been born when it was written.  The Jews were not taken
412 into exile to Babylon until 617-607 B.C.E., and Jerusalem and its temple
413 were not destroyed until 607 B.C.E.  In detail the prophecy was fulfilled
414 starting in 539 B.C.E...the night of October 5/6.
415   That fateful night in the city of Babylon, coregent Belshazzar held 
416 a banquet with a thousand of his grandees.  Nabonidus was not there to
417 see the ominous writing on the plaster wall:  "MENE, MENE, TEKEL and
418 PARSIN" because he had taken refuge in the city of Borsippa to the SW.
419 Neither was Cyrus' army sleeping in their encampment around Babylon's
420 impregnable walls, for it was a night of great activity!  In brilliant
421 strategy Cyrus' army engineers diverted the mighty Euphrates River from
422 its course through the city.  Then down the riverbed the Persians marched,
423 up over the riverbanks, to take the city by surprise through the gates
424 along the quay.
425   The Greek historian Herodotus explains:  "Had the Babylonians been
426 apprised of what Cyrus was about, they would have made fast all the 
427 street-gates which [were] upon the river...But, as it was, the Persians
428 came upon them by surprise and so took the city."  Quickly passing through
429 the streets, killing all who resisted, they captured the palace and put 
430 Belshazzer to death.  It was all over.  In one night Babylon had fallen,
431 ending centuries of Semitic supremacy; control of Babylon became Aryan,
432 and Jehovah's word of prophecy was fulfilled!
037=Usr:397 dragon lady       03/24/88 17:39  Msg:1346 Call:9077  Lines:11
433   But there is more!  Just in time for the Jews' 70-year exile to end,
434 Cyrus returned the captive Jews to their homeland, in 537 B.C.E.  What
435 about the city Babylon?  Both Isaiah and Jeremiah foretold that it would
436 eventually become uninhabited ruins.  True to prophecy, today Babylon
437 is a desolate heap of mounds.--Isaiah 13:20-22; Jeremiah 51:37, 41-43.
438   No man can accurately foretell the future in detail.  That is beyond
439 human ability.  However, the Creator of the universe possesses all the
440 necessary facts and can even control events.  Thus he can be spoken of
441 as the One who is "telling from the beginning the finale, and from long
442 ago the things that have not been done."--Isaiah 46:10; 41:22,23.

446      'd', I wouldn't be too quick at calling Nostradamus's prohecies 
447 'vague and sweeping' Quite the contrary, the primary reason for his 
448 notoriety is his rather explicit and to the point predictions. 
449      
450 Here is one from quatrain 24, second ten centuries:
451     Bestes farouches de faim fleuves tranner,
452     Plus part du champ encontre Hister sera.
453     En caige de fer le grand fera traisner,
454     Quand rien enfant de Germain observera.
455      
456 Translated to English it becomes:
457      Beasts wild with hunger will cross the rivers, the greater part of 
458 the battle will be against Hitler. He will cause great men to be dragged 
459 in a cage of iron, when the son of Germany observes no law.
460      
461      This is a direct prediction of Hitler and his evil deeds. There are      
462 several other references to Hitler, so this is not a coincidence.
463      
464 Or we can look at another popular prediction in II.51:
465      Le sang de juste a' Londres sera faulte
466      Brule's par fouldres de vingt trois les six;
467      Le dame antique cherra de place haute
468      Des mesme secte plusieurs seront occis.
469      
470 Translated to English this becomes:
471      The blood of the just will be demanded of London, Burned by fire in 
472 three times twenty plus six. The ancient lady will fall from her high 
473 position and many of the same denomination will be killed.
474      
475      This is a prediction of the Great London Fire of 1666, in which the 
476 Cathedral of St. Paul's was destroyed killing those seeking protection 
477 from the fire within it.
478      
479      Nostradamus predicted the life and death of kings, nations. Many of 
480 the predictions giving specific dates while others referred to 
481 activities over particular periods of times. His predictions were no 
482 worse for accuracy or explicit nature than the ones you quote from the 
483 bible. 
484      
485 -- John Dilks --
486      
487 Ten easy steps on learning how to be a prophet (or profit depending on 
488 your view point).
489      
490 1. Study history extensively, your best material will come from here. 
491 History always repeats itself, so just reword some past historical items 
492 into present and future predictions and call them your own.
493      
494 2. Predict devastating events. People seldom remember happy or positive 
495 events when they are predicted, they are too busy enjoying them. When 
496 bad things happen they want someone to tell them "I told your so". 
497 Somehow it makes people feel better when they think that someone knew 
498 what was going to happen.
499      
500 3. Sprinkle in some rather obvious events that even an idiot could 
501 predict that way they will more likely believe the more outlandish 
502 predictions. An example would be to predict war in an area of the world 
503 where there has always been war like the middle east. The chances of it 
504 happening are quite good.
505      
506 4. Don't worry about the predictions not coming true. People don't 
507 remember predictions that don't come true, they only remember the ones 
508 that do especially when they are particularly devastating.
509      
510 5. Publicize! By all means, toot your horn. This is why you should 
511 predict a lot of things. The more you predict the greater the 
512 probability that some of them will occur. When they do come true 
513 publicize them!
514      
515 6. Be a little vague so that you can adjust any prediction to fit a 
516 situation when it does occur, but not so vague that you can't point to 
517 it and say that it is a detailed prediction of the occurrence. You can 
518 add the details after the occurrence.
519      
520 7. Natural and man-made disasters are very productive predictions. They 
521 always have and always will occur, so you can't go wrong here. 
522 Earthquakes, fire, flood, pestulance, and war are always good for a few 
523 predictions. The further into the future you predict the more outrageous 
524 your claims can be. Earthquakes seem to be quite popular with the past 
525 prophets. Probably because they were so devastating and are fairly easy 
526 to predict if you pay attention to history. Currently the San Andrea's 
527 fault quake prediction is a good one to get onto. It is extremely likely 
528 that it will happen within the next couple of decades, and when it 
529 happens you can say you predicted it! All you have to do is predict that 
530 it will happen "this year" every year until it does. If you are 
531 particularly adventuresome give a specific date. If you hit it (one in 
532 365 chance) you'll be a big success (see #5 above though). If you miss, 
533 you can still say "well it did happen this year, so I was close".
534      
535 8. Always use props or ritualism mechanisms to divine your predictions. 
536 People don't want to believe that you yourself actually come up with the 
537 predictions, but they will happily believe that the predictions come 
538 from outside of you either through spirits or from some God.
539        
540 9. When the prediction involves the present or near future always be 
541 vague enough so that people can rationalize it away. Let them interpret 
542 it in their own words. The more rope you give them the greater chance 
543 that they will find a way to accept it as truth. But be sure to weave 
544 some common truth or obvious prediction that they can anchor themselves 
545 to so that they can believe the prediction as a whole. Remember, you can 
546 always expand on the prediction and add the details later. If you die 
547 and your predictions are particularly voluminous your followers can then 
548 interpret and expand on them if you give them something that can be 
549 easily adjusted. 
550      
551 10. Don't publicize too strongly until after the prediction comes true 
552 if your into present and near future predictions, that way you can 
553 rewrite the prediction more easily. This also allows your followers to 
554 do the same for those predictions that last past your own life span.
555 The less written wording there is the easier it is to rewrite the 
556 history of the prediction.
557      
558 Finally,
559      Don't worry about nay-sayers, for every nay-sayer there is a 
560 sucker out there ready and willing to believe anything you pour into 
561 their gullible little minds.
562

566 Ah yes, well, Nostrodamos (SP?) was rather close in his predictions. But it
567 seems to me the further in the future he went the further he was off. He did
568 come real close to Hitler (He guessed Himler), and who knows maybe in 2086 
569 there will be a nuclear war. I can't take the Bible seriously, I'm not knocking
570 God or religion (Relax big guy!), After King (Whatshisname, Richard?) had the 
571 Bible rewritten, all authenticity was lost and threfore is considered void. (No

583 As our dear friend Ronnie Ray-gun would say, "There you go again."  Try not to
584 use biblical quotes as proof that something specific occured.  It just won't 
585 work.  If you can find the corroborative evidence as to specific predictions
586 in other sources, then we can talk.
587 As an aside, why is it usually christians who feel they must justify and prove 
588 their religion?  I have never had a Buddhist or Confucian try and convert me, 
589 and Islam would rather the western world die a painful death.  I am not sure,

649 d: As I understand it, the Old Testament only achieved a form resembling it's
650 current one *during* the Babylonian exile. There is apprently a lot of
651 evidemce that it0gas massively edited and re-written then. Thus none of the 
652 "prophecies" of the exile can be considered valid, as the may have been added
653 at thiis time. 
654 	Given the level of literacy at any time until the Middle Ages, re-writing
655 the Scriptubes without getting caught would be childishly simple. And don't
656 forget translators errors. The most grievous example of *that* is the infamous
657 "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." The word translated as witch, was 
658 actually "poisoner". Yn view of the suffering caused by this *one* error and
659 the hundreds of years it took to get it corrected (actually it *still* hasn't
660 been corrected in many translations!!!) I find it impossible to accept the
661 Bible as the word of God. If0He qllowed this kind of error, what other errors
662 may be there?

665 Cap't : Alas, I too would enjoy the coding companionship of a free-spirit not
666 confined to the ways of the Warnier-Orr and the like. The slap-dashers and
667 the tele-hacking electronic nufer-do-wells quickly tire and discourage those
668 of a more lofty and more deeply committed engineering stance.
669  
670 I have been told by more than one person that good things come to those who
671 wait, and 'what comes around goes around.' The paths f consciousness take
672 two distinct paths at this point. How long to wait? In waiting there is no
673 action, and inaction often spells doom. But what is better? Action in a
674 direction that is wrong, or inaction that brings neither good nor bat. But
675 to act is to take destiny in your own hands. Karma be damned! For it is I
676 who guides my ship in the sea of existence. Is this so wrong, or are the
677 musical philosophers who said "If you choose not to decide, you still have
678 made a0choice" correct after all. Perhaps it is a combination of both
679 contexts into one usable philosophy of life - White and Black don't exist.
680 Day and Night are merely dreams. Everything is gray, all is between the
681 extremes. Meld the paths that vorm bight and left, and forge your own
682 trail through the between.
683  
684 Work on the between I will - but perchance what do you say about these
685 things. I have grown to respect the calls of your ever-insightful watch.
686 Just as the keen-eiud wure picked to stand and search the open sea for
687 those things that were desired and feared, you are asked to give your
688 opinion, in whatever form you wish. It is up to the captain of a ship
689 to decide the actions in response to the calls of0the0watch.

693           the bible. One that comes to my mind is the ever favorite

695           The original word means young, NOT virgin.

939 I'd like to thank whomever left me Mr. Wirth's address an ph.#.

941 I think I have a lead on the socks;  It's a plot by the duxti|e and laundry det
942 ergent companies!  There is an agent of some sort in the socks that reacts with
943 an agent in the soap causing only one of the socks to disintegrate!

9'1 World Watch III: I recieved my monthly/bimonthly phone call from Mr. Wirth
972 and wife; I asked about ILLUSIONS and he said he doesn't have it.  I relayed
973 his address and phone.  It was kinda nice to hear from them... seems Scott
974 is about to0becme a "petty person" soon and will be able to inflict all of
975 his sadistic daydreams upon unsuspecting grunts.  :-)

978 Leonard: Yor assumptions are only half right- I am not using a Novation modem,
979 but the modem I am using is EXTREMLY cheap, as a matter of vact it is free.
980 It is an ENVAX 501, it is really designed to the TELEX network, but it will
981 also connect to the phone network. It has (believe it or not) 15k of memory
982 and full editing features. The idea was for it to connect to a printer a~d
983 terminal and the terminal operator to compose messages for later transmission.
984 I also have a simpler non-programmable modem that WILL send CNTL D and I 
985 suppose that I will have to use that when I connect to Agora. I do need an
986 externql mdem, however, since the only thing I have is a terminal.

991 Some religiouc fanatics skip around. Perhaps the bible ione day, koran(Islam)
992 the next, torach(Jew) the third. But as for the converting aspect, well
993 we Christians are going a little over board.....
