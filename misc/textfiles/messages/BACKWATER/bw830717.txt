44 the roles of devil's advocate or arouser
45 of controversity do not ring true. the  only thing you've achieved so far 
46 is to show that beneath the dragon lady's poetic exterior lies a glimmering
47 intellectual gem.  i was ready to attack you mightily, but think a few words
48 of advice are in order...those who      attribute certain negative aspects 
49 to others, especially in gross generali-zations; i.e. 'women's dislike of 
50 themselves' often do so to deny certain inner feelings.  look deep within 
51 yourselve.  examine your emotions towards women and towards yourself.
52 remember and ponder on the words of     confucius: 'a superior man has self-
53 respect, and does not strive; is sociable, yet no party man...the superior
54 man is exacting of himself; the common  man is exacting of others.'
55 i figured this was better than hitting  you with a nicholas belker.

60 in the kingdom of valinor during the    reign of good king firamar...there
61 was a fair maiden named gabrielle...gifted with auburn hair flowing like
62 a moountain rill and the voice of a nightengale on a midsummer's eve. sweet
63 gabrielle was betrothed to the youngest prince of the realm and they loved
64 each other deeply...when morgoth invaded valinor from the east; ungliant, the
65 giant spider seized gabrielle and carried her to a desolate tor in the
66 ranges of taras-ness. slowly he suckled the life force from his captive
67 and devoured her body and soul.
68 in the passage of time, the good prince happened upon the scene and when he
69 espied what ungliant had wrought he was filled with the blood rage...
70 he drew his thundersword (thundersword?) and uttered the famous nicholas
71 belker warcry:
72                                                  suck concrete, hairball!!!
73 and thus did engage the spider in mortal combat. (one may ask, where was
74 the prince's faithful cur during all this---being no dummy, he stayed on the
75 sidelines watching the prince getting   whacked severely about the head and
76 shoulders.)   finally the prince did    vanquish the mighty ungliant in this
77 lofty aerie...but there was no joy in his victory...for he had received many
78 grievous wounds and the beautiful
79 gabrielle was lost forever
80 ah, sweet gabrielle

134    A wind, a wind has come to stir up the dust, bringing new folk, a noble
135 people, gentle of voice yet commanding in presence!  Their leader is the
136 dark prince, who captivates our Inn with masterful tales of lands full of
137 mystery and romance...he weaves a story of injustice, and speaks boldly of
138 the challenge of righting the wrong...his voice drops low with tenderness,
139 as he mourns his beloved Gabrielle...he reproves the disrespectful with
140 wisdom and tact, as befits his royal blood.  The Backwater honours such
141 guests who prove their worth...The lady raises her eyes to his, seeking
142 words to greet a royal prince, blushing, inexplicably trembling...she parts
143 her lips as if to speak, but falters, feeling unworthy of his gentle words,
144 yet wanting to express appreciation for his gentlemanly act of reprimanding
145 the surly diatriber:  "You--you are indeed a prince among princes, sir!"
146 she finally stammers.  "I--I know that you will be warmly greeted by our
147 venerable Innkeeper, for he is a true gentleman, and has spoken of your
148 quality and your gift of storytelling.  Welcome!"
149    After a flustered bow to the prince, the girl moves quickly into the
150 crowd milling about the Inn, smiling to some, brushing past others.  She
151 pauses at the sight of Aaron, who looks a little dejected at a table by
152 himself.  A sad smile touches the corner of her mouth; she slips through
153 the throng to his side.  "Aaron..." with a light touch to his shoulder, "be
154 careful which direction your humour takes.  Your apology was warming, but
155 your assessment of 'mock indignation' seemed rash...I sense the quality in
156 you, seeking expression, and I wish that I coul	d stay for the time of it's
157 true blossoming."  With a pause, she studies him; a smile twinkles again:
158 "As for females being different in some nebulous way--Aaron, where would be
159 the mystery and magic if males and females were alike in thought and deed?"
160 He opened his mouth to speak, but she was gone, laughter trailing back...
161    Later, the Innkeeper found a fragile note tacked onto the entrance:
162 
163        O the wind, do you remember the wind, dear Innkeeper...?
164      Those golden wings that were caught by the ill-tempered wind
165          Mikey, it is back, blustering mightily against me--!
166 
167    And a battered poem he had once heard came back to mind:
168 
169      From far, from ere and yon
170        twelve winded sky,
171      The stuff of life to knit me--
172        blew hither--here am I.
173      Now, for a breath I tarry,
174        nor yet disperse apart.
175      Take my hand and tell me,
176        what have you in your heart.
177      Quick, answer how can I help
178        you say,
179      Ere, to the winds Twelve Quarters,
180        I take my endless Way.

182 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>     d     <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
183 As the Innkeeper raises his head from the table he finds an empty Inn
184 about him. He thinks back on the day before and cannot be sure if he
185 he remembers it true. Were the customers truly there, or has he had
186 but a dream? As he removes the debreis of the nights enjoyment. stepping
187 outside to breath in the new day. He spies a note lightly tacked to the
188 door. It is written on a leaf that somehow seems familur. As he reads
189 the note, a sudden wind comes up and tousles his hair, and with that
190 wind a familur fragrence of something he has known. As he finishes
191 reading the note, he now knows the outcome of things past. Quietly he
192 speaks to the one who is no longer there; "Fair well Milady of Dragons,
193 May your journey be pleasent and fruitfull." With this he slowly turns
194 and reenters his Inn to prepare for the new day. But the presence remains,
195 for as always her presence has left the Inn changed in many subtle ways.
196 As he continues to prepare the Inn, he hopes that the new found customers
197 will not abandon the Inn, for without them it would soon refill with the
198 warriors and guildsmen which while a lively lot, are to often arguing to
199 the point of damaging the Inn and its customers. the Innkeeper would as
200 soon not lose his new found customers of quality and royal blood.
201 **** CISTOP MIKEY AWAITING THE NEW DAY **** 12:00PM **** 10 JULY 83 ******
202 the prince is awestruck by the graceful lady's welcome...but it seems to
203 be a farewell also...it has struck a    melancholy chord in his heart that a   
204 lady of such talent may be leaving the  warm fires of this fine establishment.
205 he wonders to himself whether the beautiful lady is wandering to other realms
206 or has lost her communication to this   land of the backwater...
207 he is saddened that a little of the magic will be lost here and wonders
208 if there is any way he can aid the lady?

243 So, you are a member of the SCA! Where do you hail from, I'm
244 from Stromgard. (If you are from Three Mountains, don't worry, I
245 don't mind). 
246 	As I write this I await word of the new king. It is truly
247 a pity that the Crown tourney turned out the way it did, is it not?

249 Mikey, I tried dumping drive b into my buffer so I could save it
250 to disk. Unfortunately, when the buffer filled it automatically
251 sent a ^S so I could save it to disk. The system resumed output
252 before the save was finished. Could you increase the delay a bit?
253 Or is there a way to get the system to transmit the entire disk
254 using MODEM protocol?

258 To: Mike Day   Fm:  Adam Trent   Sj:  AMODEM Vindicated
259    ------  Or An Essay on Debugging till 4AM  -------
260 I decided to find out why I had such erratic problems when using
261 AMODEM for fast local 9600 baud transfers.  I tried your suggested
262 RCVSOHE change and saw the dramatic speed increase you mentioned.
263 But that was only when I was able to get the file transfer started.
264 I still had the symptoms of only being able to get a file transfer
265 started after I did a reset on the CCS (California Computer Sysstems
266 Model 2200) and re-entered AMODEM.  Short of running a recent listing
267 (humongous!) and using SID, I tried to shotgun my way to smooth transfers.
268 I still had this vague notion of a processor speed differential that
269 may be causing somekind of deadlock during NAK-ACK-handshake.  But, I
270 have learned the error of my ways.  Read on.
271   I tried many possible different combinations of eliminating CALL
272 GARBAGE--from completely, to selective use of it in, eg, the GETNAK
273 routine..  I also tried MVI B,x in some logical candidates of CALL RECV.
274 All to no avail.  Boy, was I barking up the wrong tree.  After several
275 hours of trial-and-error debugging (it's not always a cardinal sin),
276 I decided to THINK and try logic.  I stared at the listing for an hour
277 and began to zero-in on SENDNAK.  It then dawned on me that the CCS
278 might be locking-up on a low-level spinlock in the Modem out routine
279 (MOUTPUT).  But this routine was sacred since I had put it in myself
280 and it had never done me wrong when hooked to a modem.  Now I was in
281 hot pursuit.  I had used the "recommended" serial port output routine
282 for the CCS-2719 I/O board.  In that routine I got rid of a spin-check
283 for a DCD bit (Data Carrier Detect).  That was it.  I still don't know
284 fully how the lockup was happening.  My theory is that the recommended
285 driver code is only good for a DTE rather than a DCE.  Since I had 
286 configured the CCS port as a DCE (to match the DTE RS232 of the KAYPRO)
287 it may not be appropriate to expect a DCD signal from a DTE. (From a
288 modem, yes; but not from a terminal).  
289   This is the second time I've been bitten by the CCS system: (1) Their
290 recommended serial driver has the above problem.  (2) Their BIOS writer
291 didn't implement the CP/M SELDSK call properly. To wit, it doesn't 
292 return HL=0 for drive-not-available.  This second is apalling.  It means
293 that my nifty routine to determine what drives are available won't work
294 on the CCS.  But I bring this story to a close.
295   I put all the CALL GARBAGEs back (I did leave your change at RCVSOHE)
296 and it all appears to run OK--locally at 9600 baud between CCS and
297 KAYPRO and right now at 300 thru a modem.  
298   Sorry about the false alarm.

326 There seems to be great concern about the division on humans into 2 very
327 dissimilar groups, male and female. Since there is no willingness to group
328 them into one, how about the next step: let's drop the stereotypes and
329 break us down into a few more groups, like individual persons? Seems

353 For you, B.A.D, on individuality:
354 " 
355 I am an individual, secure in my past, enjoying the present, seeking the future.
356 I do not choose to be a common man.
357 It is my right to be uncommon...if I can.
358 I seek opportunity, not security.
359 I do not wish to be a kept citizen, humbled and dulled by having the
360  state look after me.
361 I want to take the calculated risk, to dream and to build, to fail and
362  succeed.
363 I refuse to barter incentive for a dole.
364 I prefer the challenges of life to a guaranteed existence, and the
365  thrill of self-fulfillment to the calm of bland status quo.
366 I will not trade my freedom for beneficence, nor my dignity for a
367  handout.
368 I will never cower before any master nor bend to any threat.
369 It is my heritage to stand erect, proud and unafraid, and to think
370  and act for myself, facing the world boldly as the individual that I am."

414 thanks for the prompt and extensive(!)
415 reply!I will peruse that list carefully
416 to determine which or who I will
417 call.I am using a C-64 as a terminal,
418 that is until i get my real terminal
419 (128 col. BONZAI!)installed,prob. within
420 the next week.The reason I am typing 40
421 cols. is my cheapo TV cuts off the right
422 edge and I like being able to read my
423 own typing!DL seemed apprehensive about
424 my modem,also.

428 while walking through the forest of aragon one warm summer morning;
429 the prince happens on a small mountain  meadow surrounded by towering
430 trees.  he stops for a while to rest and review his memories of the
431 brief encounter with the fair lady of   dragons...one word keeps passing
432 through his thoughts like a mantra: "maybe..."...finally he rouses himself
433 and goes in search of his faithful companion who is on a quest of his own
434 for the elusive forest of aragon fireplug.

447 You bet! I think nicknames are probably a great way to start out with a bunc
448 h of strangers on a new board. This is my 1st time here and I'm not poetic 
449 but from time to time I can manage to come up with something to say, and as 
450 I'm not basically outgoing, i prefer to remain anonymous at this point. See 
451 ya later!!!!

454 Ahh, how refreshing it is to step into this cozy Inn and observe
455 the variety of clientel.  Some are just begging for attention, yet
456 are being ignored.  Others are the center of attention.  Some are
457 doomed to never return to the Inn, others will be here ALWAYS.
458 I do, however, sense an aura of doom surrounding the Inn.  There
459 have been conflicts arising between members of the clientel.  Such
460 is not good to preserve the happy mood of the Inn.  Some key
461 personalities are leaving - and it is now known if they shall ever
462 return.  I sense a regression to ways of the past.  So sad....

515 in the early morning hours, the prince  sits alone and ponders
516 the events of the day...for the first time in years he is
517 moved to tears.  it is a new experience for the prince--for
518 a prince is not supposed to show his emotions.  he thinks of
519 friendships that are all too short...and things that could
520 have been and may never be...he calls a silent farewell to 
521 one who brightened up his life if but   for a moment...and
522 then resolves himself to face the bright new day...

532 As the Innkeeper steps into his establishment he finds the atmosphere
533 full of sadness. He spies the young prince and asks why the gloom.
534 Upon the reply, he too is greatly sadened, for the prophecy that
535 had been fortold has finaly come true. Weep O merry men for the morrow
536 comes not. The end of an era is at hand. For the winds have blown our
537 fair maiden away, and the morrow may never bring her golden wings to
538 this land again. Weep, O weep for the morrow has come.

579 TO: ALL WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LINE 305      FM: CISTOP MIKEY
580 Yes, it is a bug, what is happening is that if the line has 128
581 characters in it the search commands (FI and FA) get lost and
582 take the line as a hit. I don't know why, but it does. This bug
583 has always been in this software. I didn't write it, I don't
584 know what is causing it, and I am not going to fix it. It is
585 highly unusual for anyone to enter that many characters in a line
586 anyway, so there is no real urgent need to fix it anyway.

588 To: Leonard      Fm: CISTOP MIKEY
589 Were you the one earlier who was having problems with the down load?
590 Either way, there is no time out on the control S function What might
591 have happened, is that it picked up a garbage character. Once the
592 system stops on a control S it will restart on anything that comes in.
