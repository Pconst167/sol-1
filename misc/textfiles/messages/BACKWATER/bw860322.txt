21   Do I believe this? Do my roving orbs  decieve me? Am I at the top? I come backafter a long hiatus (after a time on 
22 this board in which, it must be noted, Inever made it to the upper eschelons of glory) and I find this board strangely
23 less busy than I left it. What's the    deal? Have I just struck upon a good     time of the day to call? Or has there 
24 been some monumental schism that I am   not aware of? ( besides the Destroyer...ah.. incident) 
25 
26 Back to the book of the Pariana Riva.   The number four holds great significance in the land of Illyria. There are four seasons,
27 each boasting it's own seasonal animal. These animals are the Dragon of Summer, the Phoenix of Spring, The Unicorn of   winter, 
28 and the Gryphon of fall. Each of these  hold almost messianic status in the     Illyrian Religion. In the ruling body,  as well 
29 as the theocracy, there are paralells.  THere are four seats of power, each corresponding to one of the four elements and held
30 by a practicer of the four basic arts.
31 ( Elements: earth, wind, fire, water...   Arts: priest, sorceror, warrior, mariner.)
32 The Book of the Pariana Riva states thatthe two most popular thrones are the    earthen throne, and the Merlaor (undersea) 
33 throne. This is because these are the only two elected trhones. The other two,  the thrones of Fire and Wind, are eitherempty 
34 (as in the case of the throne of Fire)  or unconcerned with governing  (as with  the sorceror that holds the Northern throne of 
35 the winds.) There are many more parralells that can be drawn, but for now they would be too tedious to write., as well asread. 
36 More later.
37 To the author of the Book of Souls..    Is it a real book, or are you writing itout of your own fertile little 'maginings
38       Yours, riding on the winds of spring....
39

42 Rivania: It was nice of you to attempt to save lines, but next time use
43 MA 120. As it stands most of your lines are 127 (128?) characters long.
44 This means that (due to a bug) the FI & FA commands will "find" those
45 lines (ie a 128 char line is an automatic match).

49     From Prometheus; Aside the warm light of a soft lamp
50     The electrical circuits in my room decided to take a shower.  In their own
51 sparks, but a shower.  There were a few fires in the wiring and the insulated
52 aluminum wiring is in it's last days.  Emergency wiring was installed until the
53 old stuff is ripped away.  Leaving me with a five inch teleivision, and a fine
54 lamp, on the floor.  The effect of this on my monitor is pleasant, and I felt
55 the urge to do something under the light.
56     Hence, this entry.
57     Assorted messages follow.
58     Guardian;  I wish you had never disclosed the secret of the numbers.  Now
59 they are visible every sixty lines, or so.  Do us a favor, and never reveal any
60 other notation systems.  Until then, sd8503.22 mt1824.43, heh, heh.
61     Man in Gray;  Dad let me drive to Colorado.  The roads are a lot different
62 when I drive, they were easier when someone else was driving.  Once I got to
63 the promontory the observatory is on, it looked worse too.  Those people left a
64 few crates of ammunitions in the corrugated tin walls.  The main lens had razor
65 scratches on it, and there are at least fifteen pounds of sugar in the kitchens
66 that weren't there a year ago.
67     The spent shell casings fit ingrams.
68     I think we might be in a little trouble.  Renting it out was incredibly
69 stupid.  I might be able to blame it on hunters, and stray chefs, but no one
70 is going to believe me.

172 #########################################################################
173 It seemed like an eternity being stuck in the statis field. I had no
174 real idea what was going on, or even what this was all about. It was 
175 all so frightening. The voice in my head was of no help. It was almost
176 smug in it's knowledge of things. I wish I was back in my safe and 
177 secure Inn. I wasn't cut out for all this adventuring stuff. 
178 The Inn! WHo was watching the Inn? What was happening to it? Why anything
179 could happen. It could be burned down or overrun while I'm stuck here.
180 I hope it is alright. 
181 My little voice had been quiet for sometime. since it tried to do what 
182 ever it had tried to do before the restraining system had taken hold
183 it had not said a word. I didn't know if it was biding its time or 
184 planing some devious plot. -Say something- #Something# -Well, at least 
185 I know you're still there. What have you gotten me into though?- 
186 #I haven't gotten you into anything. This primitive contraption has 
187 gone into an overload condition from too many entities occupying it
188 at the sametime. When the space/time dialation field generator started
189 to fail the autoreturn mechanism took effect and is attempting to now
190 return the vehice to its original source.# -Huh?- #It's heading for the 
191 repair shop.# -Oh, why didn't you say that in the first place?- 
192 #Sigh... never mind... If we're lucky it will make it before the whole
193 thing colapses in a pile of molten metal and plastic.# -And if we aren't
194 lucky?- Then the power generator will fail, and the containment field
195 around the blackhole that powers this thing will disappear, and we'll
196 all be sucked into it crushing us into nothing.# -Oh... I hope that 
197 doesn't happen, I've got to get back to the Inn.- #Sigh, I don't know 
198 which is less intellegent, you or that slime slug I was stuck with
199 last time.# 
200 The air around me started to shift more quickly traveling the whole 
201 spectrum of the visible colors and beyond. Getting brighter and brighter
202 as they shifted. the throbing noise was getting louder too, as was 
203 the smell of burnt something or other. Just when I thought it was going
204 to go on forever, there was a loud thump, and the vehicle came to a
205 shuddering stop vibrating everything despite the statis field that was
206 still in effect. The compartment deformed and canted to one side from
207 the force of the landing. Moments later the force of the landing apparently
208 caused irreperable damage to the controls, because the statis field 
209 suddenly let go in the midst of an explosion from the control panel
210 that showered everyone in the area with sparks and bits of burning 
211 whatever it was that made up the equipment. Having been in a bit of an
212 awkward position before the statis field took effect, I fell flat on my
213 face when it let loose. "Well," Bard said, "We're home...I think..."

322        FIRST STEPS IN MAGIC
323 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
324 IT IS APPARENT THAT ONE CANNOT BECOME   A PRACTISING MAGICHIN
325 UNTILL ONE HAS A PLACE TO PRACTIS  -            A MAGIC TEMPLE or ALTER
326 THIS DOSENT MEAN YOU MUST CLUTTER THE     ROOM WHITH MAGICAL SYMBOLS
327 IN FACT YOU CAN MAKE A ALTER OUT OF A     EVERY DAY COFFE TABLE..
328 BUT BE WORNED DO NOT USE THIS TABLE FOR   ENY THING ELSE THEN MAGIC..!
329 THE TABLE SHOULD BE AT LEAST 3ft X 2ft.  THE BIGGER THE ALTER THE BETTER.
330 A TEMPLE CAN SOME WHUT BE MADE IN THE SAME  WAY .. THOU ITS NOT WISE,
331 ITS BETTER TO HAVE A HOLE ROOM OR ATTECT,  BASMENT, ETC,. 
332 FOR THE OF A TEMPLE......
333 LET S JUST STAY WHITH THE MAKING OF AN ALTER   FOR NOW BECOUSE ITS
334 MUCH EASYER, & TAKES A LOTS LESS EFERT.
335 FOLLOWING ARE LIST OF MATTERIALS NEEDED.
336 =================================

338 13 CANDELS;(perferbly Black)
339 PITCHURE OF A PENTAGRAM (a inverted star)
340 A RED CLOTH
341 WHITE PAPPER & A BLACK FLARE PEN.
342 =================================
343 YOU WILL ALSO NEED A ROBE OR GARMINT   IT SHOULD ALSO BE BLACK
344 BUT IF YOU DONT HAVE ONE ENY COLLOR WILL DO..
345 PLUS YOU WILL NEED A SMALL BOX NO LARGER    THEN 6` HIGH
346 NOW THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED FOR NOW
347 WE CAN PROSEED TO BLESS THEM.
348 PLACE THE BLACK CLOTH OVER YOUR ALTER THEN PLACE THE SMALLER BOX
349 AT THE FAR SIDE FROM WERE YOU WILL BE SITTING
350 PLACE THE RED CLOTH OVER IT & THEN PLACE TWO  CANDELS ON EACH SIDE 
351 OF THE SMALL BOX..   NOW TAKE YOUR PAPER IT SHOULD BE NO LARGER THEN
352 6` HIGH..USING THE FIRST 4 PICES.
353 DRAW THE FOLLOWING SYMBOLS INTHE CENTER OF THE PAPER.
354 =================================
355 MAGIC ELMINT             SYMBOL
356 	  THE SIGIL OF TARUS:

376 My mind was numb, even after the stasis field switched off (or became
377 inoperable?).  One thing I never did understand- if the entire craft was
378 placed in a a stasis field, including the stasis device itself- why didn't the
379 craft and all its contents remain in stasis forever?  Never mind, don't explain
380 it to me.
381 Small bits of flaming debris rained down on us.  A few began to burn into my
382 robe, as if that mattered anymore; it already had several serious char marks.
383 A quick survey of the cabin- no one seriously hurt, hard to tell in the case
384 of the alien, though.  I helped the Innkeeper to his feet, he having fallen
385 to the deck of the craft.
386 My strength was still not much to work with, but the sleep had helped.  I made
387 a tremendous effort to remain upright, the Innkeeper now aiding me.  "Anyone
388 know where we are?"
389 A rap-tap-tapping on the craft's outer door silenced me.  I tried to smile.
390 "Well, who could *THAT* be at this hour?  Bard, are you expecting company?
391 If I'd known this was going to be a social fgathering," I gestured toward my
392 tattered robes, "I would have worn my Sunday best."

395 I've been looking at a limited archives, about 1 JAN 85 to 23 JAN 85- about
396 the time when Dangerfield gets his and Farley is inducted into NET.  Level 4
397 code is first introduced; Petrov is taken by the PPD Kinko Squad.  I see
398 JUGGLER'S first entry- all caps.  Ye gods and little things, has it already
399 been more than a year?
400 Where does the time go?

404   The piper brushed the sparks off his faded kilt.  The chlorine atmosphere
405 had faded the tartan so that the sett was almost invisible where folds had
406 not protected the cloth.  Carefully, bleach wasn'
407 (oops, wasn' --> wasn't) very selective, it tended to attack the cloth as 
408 well as the dye.  He licked his thumb and applied the moisture to a persis-
409 tent spark that seemed intent on igniting the whole of his tattered clothing
410 and began to look around.
411   Most of the company seemed to be in good shape, the innkeeper nursing a
412 bruised nose from a fall, Milchar helping him stem the pain.  The field
413 within the craft seemed to have prevented injuries within.  Unfortunately,
414 the same could not be said of the bard's vehicle.  The piper hoped that
415 the bard had propiated the appropriate gods with sufficient gold (they had
416 just rased the required sacrifice rate or "premium") to enable him to get
417 the vehicle repaired.
418   With the rest, the piper turned to look at the door as it reverberated
419 to the sudden pounding.

425 A needed recap
426 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
427     The Former stood on the white floor.  It had been a few days ago that the
428 metamorphism left him in this state.  Dealing for a transporting device, it had
429 led him to this spot.  A faulty transporter had nabbed the Innkeeper and taken
430 him to a place on this planet.  Probably nearby.
431     The device told him this was the site of the faulty transporter, and so he
432 arrived to investigate.  It appeared to be a home, an alien, strange home, but
433 a home none-the-less.  It seemed calculated for a six-handed alien, who could
434 breath the planet's atmosphere; chlorine.
435     The alien also experimented with transporters.  The faulty transporter was
436 probably an experiment gone wrong.  Now it had to work though.   For as the
437 Former stood in this alien mushroom of a home, the Innkeeper and all the rest
438 were at the mercy of the Bard's stasis field.
439 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
440     The Former let the panels operate themselves.  Light blinked in random
441 patterns.  Dials turned of their own accord.  Slides tugged this way and that.
442 Phantoms of the Innkeeper and the rest faded in and out.  A whistle rose in
443 pitch until it all stopped.
444     The Bard's vehicle was solid.  The phantoms were now solid, behind the
445 metallic walls of the vehicle.  The stasis field must have been shattered in
446 the transport.  Everything was solid, and in motion.
447     Leaving the panel to stand itself down, the Former walked up to the vehicle
448 and pounded on it.  No hatches or doors were visible.  No way to tell if the
449 party inside was safe or dead.  No way t5o relieve the tension of the moment.
450 Not until a stunned face popped out of the vehicle.
451     "Hello?"

460    To Prince Dragon:
461 
462    Obviously you have not met my little buddy Sparky. He is what you might call
463 "Creme De La Dragon". But I will agree  with you on one point.. Dragons will 
464 not tolerate cohabitation with semi-    mortals ON  EARTH. In the cosmic void, 
465 they can be quite loveable.
466    Of course, It is a bit of a trial, I mean, Sparky devoted to the destruction
467 of the universe and me dedicated to     eternal good, but once we cross that
468 doorstep, our careers are forgotten. Youmight say that the time we spend
469 together is "quality" time. It is not   often that you find a Dragon that
470 doesn't try to tie you to home and      family. 
471    He also likes to fetch the
472 Oregonian for me. In the RAIN yet!!
473 
474     Give him a call! I'm sure that you  could find lots to talk about. Right 
475 now he is researching for his Doctoral  thesis on the subject of " Princesses 
476 in the Modern world; a Guide to good    eats."
477 
478 To the Author of the Book of Souls..
479 
480    I would fain warn you not to give    away too many of the Golden secrets.   
481 Things have a way of balancing out, and the power you allow others to posses is
482 the power that you lose.
483 
484       Beware!!

488 dear modemites,
489      How often would you use this bulletin board if you had to pay for every
490 minute you were on the modem?  Local phone companies across the state are 
491 trying to make Local Measured Service mandatory.Businesses, service 
492 organizations and people angry at enormous phone rate increases have already
493 collected over half the signatures necessary to stop Mandatory Measured Service
494 in Oregon.  Help collect signatures to save telecommunicating;call OSPIRG at
495 222-xxxx for information and petitions, or write us at arthur ptld,

500 lurking today...Guardian, I got your message from nerd.  Thanks!
501 ....................................Entropy.................
502 BEWARE! The truth about the Book of Souls has been revealed. The author is
503 plagerizing from another well-known book on the subject. He or she is changing
504 a few of the words but it is definitely taken from the source I found. This
505 presents two problems. First off, the person entering these messages does not
506 give proper credit to the real authors and their publisher. Secondly, the 
507 person entering these messages is taking credit for their creation him or her
508 self. This is not the sort of thing telecommunications users need to have
509 tarnishing their image. People who steal ideas and take credit themselves are
510 a scurge on the good name of modemers everywhere and all steps should be taken
511 to eliminate the problem. I would be glad to share the title of the book and
512 where I found it if anyone is interested. Let us hope this so called author
513 sees the error of his or her ways and apologizes for the plagerism and promises
514 never to do so again.

560 "Keeper": I hope you exercise more care in your rituals than you do in your
561 entries here. If you made half as many mistakes in spelling alone, as you
562 do here, you'd be in big trouble. Anyone who has even *begun* to study the
563 arts knows that there is no such thing as a "minor" detail, or a "trivial"
564 error.
565 ..............................the apprentice...............................
566      Bard lay where the impact had thrown him. He cautiously gave the
567 barest twitch to each muscle. When only minor twinges resulted, he decided
568 that he was relatively intact.
569      He arose and took a quick look around the conveyor. The automatics
570 seemed to have taken care of the worst of the damage, so only minor fires
571 had resulted. The full extent of the damage (both to the vehicle and and
572 to his finances) was just beginning to register as a punding noise drew
573 his attention.
574      He climbed over to the hatch and was about to open it when he realized
575 that he had no guarantee that the guages next to it were registering 
576 properly. He couldn't be sure *what* was out there. Steeling himself for
577 anything, he opend a small panel and cracked open a valve behind it.
578      Well, the pressure was a close match, no major hissing. He gave a 
579 cautious sniff. Seemed ok... well...
580      He opened the hatch and stuck his head out.
581      "Hello?"

608      He couldn't do it. Cragmore strained every fiber of his psionic ability
609 but it was no use. The alien either wouldn't respond, or it couldn't respond.
610 Unfortunately, the inability of Cragmore to reach the alien did not mean an
611 end to the screeching he felt in his head, a psychic noise akin to pure
612 unadulterated torture.
613      Slowly, his body came out of its self-imposed physical freeze, and his
614 mind did what it could to thaw the limbs that had been dead to the world
615 for the past few minutes. Pain. As his senses began to register the
616 surroundings, nerves started carrying the after-effects of a body that had
617 been tossed like chaff to the brain. Cragmore winced, concentrated, and the
618 pain subsided, a bit.
619       Opened eyes revealed a small disaster scene. Bard's ship was a mess,
620 more than the usual dirty walls and unclean specimen bags. The inside of
621 the ship was torn apart. Milchar, Innkeeper, Bard, Piper, and the hideous 
622 looking alien stood around, surveying the damage themselves, and doing what
623 clean-up seemed appropriate.
624       Sound came rushing back, and Cragmore could hear the words 'landed'
625 and 'stasis' and 'my ship!' then a loud pounding, from somewhere outside.
