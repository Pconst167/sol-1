29 known of this dark, mysterious creature who inhabits no reality and all
30 realities.  This creature is not even flesh and blood.  Perhaps it is a "sou-
31 self" that never found a material form.  Perhaps it is only an apparition, a
32 dream, or an halucination.  Or perhaps it exists in the deepest, darkest
33 recesses of a being's inner self.  In any event, it is as real as you or I, n
34 infinitely more deadly and unpredictable than the s ferocious Arcturan
35 Xanbrath-mog.  This creature has been seen in all known realities, yet seems
36 not to have the ability to change form.  Not that it really needs such an
37 abilitiy.  Energy in all forms seems to be sucked in and swallowed by the vey
38 shadowy immensness of this "thing", if "thing" it is.  Structures fall, hope
39 fails, life ends in its presence.  Weapons and war are useless.  It seems no
40 age or change in any way.  Yet it comes not unbidden; neither comes it tll 
41 unannounced.  Only those who are unusually perceptive have even a hint of wht
42 is about to happen, though it is of little value to them.  Beware the
43 Nightshade!  It comes with utter death and utter death brings it!

77 piper - I think we have discovered one of the problems arising from
78 making important entries on drive B.
79 I had logged on, found that the disks had been shifted, and so
80 read the bottom of drive B. The last thing there was bard's ticky-tacky
81 little boxes.  I logged off for a while, thought about what I was
82 going to write, came back on and entered it.  You must have been on
83 between those two times and left yours.  I am certainly sorry for the
84 mix-up; I would have been more than happy to follow your lead.

104   THEMNAX HAD TOO MUCH ON HIS MIND TO GO RUNNING OUT AFTER SOME HOLLOGRAPHIC 
105 ILLUSION SHOUGHTING EMPTY CHALLANGES.  I DID LOOK OUT AND SEE THE
106 SHIMMERING AROUND THE EDGES WHICH THE 'BRAVE' FIGHTER TYPES WERE IN TOO
107 MUCH OF A BLOOD BLINDED HURY TO NOTICE.  A SHORT WHILE LATER HE DID NOTICE SOME 
108 SORT OF PIECE OF PAPER BEING CIRCULATED FOR SIGNATURES.
109   WHEN HE LEARNED OF IT'S CONTENTS HE ENTHUSIASTICLY SIGNED IT:  THEMNAX OF 
110 LANANARA; H.U.B.(2), X-21, X^N.
111   HIS REMAINING POSSESIONS HAD UNDERGON SUBTLE CHANGES.  THERE FORM WAS BASICLY 
112 THE SAME AS IT HAD BEEN AND THOSE FUNCTIONS HE DARED TO TEST SEEMED TO WORK 
113 NORMALY, MOST OF THEM AT LEAST, BUT ALL OF THE EXTERNAL CONTROLS AND INDICATORS 
114 HAD TRANSFORMED INTO RECCOCO ARTWORK OF ESOTERIC AND GENERALY MEANINGLESS (TO 
115 HIM) DESIGN.  TO MAKE SOMETHING FUNCTION HE HAD TO THINK AT IT INSTEAD OF 
116 OPPERATE SOME MECHANICAL CONTROL.  THIS WAS NO GREAT LOSS.  THE GRAV-SLED AND
117 MASTERBOT HAD BOTH HAD PSIONIC INTERFACES WITH WHICH HE COMMUNICATED VIA THE 
118 PSIONIC AMPLIFICATION OF THE BELT OF XENDU HE STILL WORE.
119   HE COULD NOT BEGIN TO COMPRIHEND ALL THESE SUBTLE CHANGES BUT HE STRONGLY
120 SUSPECTED THAT WHATEVER IT HAD BECOME, HE WOULD BE IN BIG TROUBLE IF EVER HE 
121 WERE PARTED FROM THAT BELT.
122   THE MINITURISED NINGIES IN HIS POCKET WERE NOW FLAT, TRIANGULAR COINS OF 
123 98 FINE GOLD.  HE ASSUMED THEY WOULD STILL SERVE FOR LEGAL TENDER IN THAT FORM. 
124   AT ANY RATE THE INNKEPER SEEMED PLEASED WHEN HE HANDED TWO OF THEM TO HIM.
125   HE OFFERED TO TRADE THE SERVICES OF THE MASTERBOT AS WAITER AND ALL AROUND 
126 IMPLIMENT FOR LONG TERM LODGING, NO LONGER HAVING ANYWARE ELSE TO STAY IN THIS 
127 REALM AND NO SPEEDY WAY OF GETTING ANYWARE ELSE.  THE MAGIK CARPET (FORMERLY
128 GRAV-SLED) HE WOULD KEEP FOR LOCAL TRANSPORT.
129   
130   INTRODUCING HIMSELF FORMALY TO MORBY, APPRENTICE AND THE REST, HE ASKED IF HE 
131 MIGHT SHARE THERE TABLE.  PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE LORE FOR LORE HE COULD TRADE.  
132 HE REALIZED HE WAS STILL NEW HERE, WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE BEEN AT THE H.U.B.
133 AND THAT HE STILL HAD MUCH TO LEARN.

136 Voyeur -- I left the ms in question near the end of drive A very early one 
137 morning.  Within several hours, the  disk had filled and gone to B!  And I 
138 was (sob) overlooked.  Ah, well, we have escaped from the disaster, I from a
139 crashing wall of water that swept over where I stood with you, you from an
140 earthquake, and we are both in more trouble now.  Reality does not *have* to
141 be singular when you travel about in it.  It looks like the piper is alone now.
142 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
143    The piper lay unconcious for a very long time.  He had been moved by extreme
144 fear at the sight of the tidal wave rushing toward him, and not knowing whether
145 anall of the others had escaped in the automobile, he had exerted every ounce
146 of his mental force to move every living mammal within whatever distance he
147 could encompass.  The strain of moving that volume, even on a bleak and 
148 apparently dead landscape, with pipes that had not been properly tuned was too
149 much for him.  His last thought had been of interest in the surface coming
150 up towards him -- then blackness claimed him.
151 --------------------------
152    The piper awoke very disoriented and for long moments could not even
153 conciously connect his being with the sensations that were coming in to him.
154 He felt a curious warm hard surface against his cheek, but did not realize that
155 it had anything to do with him.  He felt a pain in his mouth, and the saltiness
156 of blood where he had cut his lip on the blowpipe, but had no idea that this
157 was not completely normal.  His eyelids fluttered open by reflex, but he made
158 no attempt to move -- he was incapable of such sustained coherent thought.
159   He had no concept of identity, he simply lay -- a sponge absorbing sensations
160 until something caught what little attention he had left.  Something warm 
161 bumped against his leg and the novelty of the sensation caused him to try to
162 turn his head.  The pain brought a groan from his lips and a soft hiss from
163 near his legs.  He lay for several moments stunned by thisunfamiliar perception.
164 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
165 
166 They were all, (except L'homme) discussing what to do about the car.
167 It seemed to have nosed into a trench caused by the collapse of a utility tunnel
168 under the street.
169 The bard happened to glance into the car. A shocked look appeared on his 
170 face and started to open the door. Realizing that there wasn't enough time
171 he yelled "Grab onto the car AND DON'T LET GO!!"
172 The others barely had time to comply as the car began to shift. 
173 When reality stabilized again the bard barely had the strength to reach
174 the console and switch it to OFF. He muttered something about "... quake
175 triggered .... shift..." before he passed out. The others had time to note
176 piper's body off to one side before the effects of the unshielded shift caught 
177 up with them.
178 The only movement was that of small animals investigating the
179 "bodies"...
180 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
181 I gotta remember to zero the controls before I leave them! Anyway, we're 
182 all in the same place now. All that remains is for Piper to tell us where
183 HERE is.

185 all:  The Hillsboro BBS is now running
186       3:00 P.M. to midnight. The system

198 Aaron: Are you still around? I had tried to answer before, but alas, the disks
199 were full. You should try to make it to the SF meeting on Saturday, or at least
200 the PC&S Tavern afterwords... Have you come to your senses and decided to sell
201 me your 'extra' computer?
202 *)*$#@)$*@)
203 The last thing on l'homme's mind now was despair. The 'reality shift',
204 as Bard had called it, must have knocked everyone out, (to put it in the words
205 of a 20th century man). 
206 L'homme didn't know how long he had been out, but he did know one thing,
207 he wasn't in the same place he was before he blacked out. Yes...this place was
208 definitly different...very strange indeed. And there over on the other side
209 of the car was piper! He tried to call out his name, but for some unknown
210 reason, the words just wouldn't come out. Then L'homme noticed that the party
211 was not alone. He tried to call out to the others, who, besides piper, hadn't
212 recovered from the 'shift', but his vocal cords still refused to obey. There
213 were small animals darting in and around the group. "Now this is really getting
214 strange!", thought L'homme. I better wake the others up. Maybe they know what's
215 going on here. Voyeur was the closest, so he was the first recipient of L'homme'
216 s shaking. "Wake up! Wake up!", L'homme thought to himself.

221 elsewhere then the Inn.

223 The Ninja was stuck at the Inn. He wasn't a reality shifter. Once
224 he had delt with magic. The semi-old patrons of the Inn remembered the
225 Phoenix Egg. He still had it except fear kept him from using it. The only
226 force greater then fear must be boredom.
227 The Ninja slowly reached a shakey hand into the pouch were the gem

302   " Gather round, and I shall show you something quite interesting.  This is

308   Dawg trudged inti his room, and moments later came out with the pack.  Morby
309 searched through his meager supplies and personal belongings, and pulled out
310 three medium sized hardcover books.  Morby looked at the colorful map, and
311 then scanned through the first book, till he found the sub map he wanted.
312 The Lazy One stared at the books, and then asked a question.
313   " Where did you get those books.  I have seen similar types, but never 
314 those."

373 silvery flame, gone as the flame disappears.  "Well, now to wait.  Six, five, four, three, two, one, Put on your gas
374 masks, we're going in!"
375 Gesturing wildy, Milchar spins a colorful wave of light around The Doctor, Psycho, Gizmo, and himself, which tightens
376 around them and squeezes them into another place...
377 A sound of hundreds of people laughing hsyterically comes to the ears of the group.  "I see that the 'box' was opened,
378 just as you predicted, Doctor.  Psycho, get the sceptre, and we'll detain any guards that come this way.", Milchar 
379 said.  #Yes, how did you know that?#  "Well, it's quite simple.  They scanned it for toxic substances, scanned it 
380 probably a dozen different ways before they came to the conclusion that they couldn't find out what was in it before
381 they opened it.  You see, a Timelord's greatest weakness is his curiosity-  that'll get him every time."
382 A small patrol of guards, only half awake, stumbled into the room.  Milchar, without a side glance, mutters a few 
383 powerful words under his breath and the men suddenly stop cold, and fall asleep.  "Hmm... without this Nitrous Oxide
384 cover, someone would have tripped the alarm by now.  I think that we may not have much trouble after all."  Just then,
385 Psycho runs up to the three, with a long pointed object in one hand.  "Hugtebo Yggstan Reposnugce!", he says.  (Trans:
386 'Let's get outta here!').  "I quite agree, let's not push our luck.", The Doctor says.  Milchar brings out the Amulet,
387 and all fall though a square hole in the floor..... to fall on a mattress, inside the Tardis.  Above them, through a
388 hole, they can hear the sound of a siren.  Milchar mutters something about 'noise pollution' before he waves his hand
389 to close the opening.  A guard, wearing a gas mask, take his rifle and aims it down through the hole.  The Doctor,
390 acting quickly, summons his will and forces the gap closed. The gurad disintergrates a 5-foot patch of the 
391 palace's marble floor.
392 The object in Psycho's hand begins to shimmer, and in a rainbow accompaniment, vanishes.  A gathering of light to 
393 The Doctor's hand shows that he now holds an object, much different than the scepter- The Key to Time.

397    What an incredible odyssey! re-counting the events of the 
398 last few weeks....
399   A BEAUTIFUL day! Glancing out the peep-hole I had gnawed in a 
400 decaying side-wall of the inn, I could see that this was THE day
401 for a dashing young hamster to take fate in hand and find his 
402 fortune outside the comforting walls of the inn. Packing what 
403 little belongings I have, a quick goodbye to my new friends, and
404 with a cheek-full of the innkeeper's best ale, I set off to seek
405 my fortune.  The smell of damp earth!  The blue sky, dew-covered
406 moss, birds singing a heavenly chorus! LIFE! Ahh, the beauty of
407 it all. With such excellent weather, and pleasant atmosphere, I
408 should make several kilometers by nightfall, then, (hamsters are
409 night people) with some luck, locate a young female hamster also
410 on the fast track for some serious backgammon, cognac, and...???
411   A good 1200 meters. I'm pooped! Time for a break, maybe nibble
412 on a little fenugreek growing nearby. Yawn, I am SOOO tired, I
413 think I'll just settle down for a (yawn..) little nap. Day 
414 travel just does not suit me! Well, I'll make much better time
415 after nightfall, anyway. G'night.
416   "Beep."
417   "Beep? I don't think I brought my alarm clock, (yawn) It's 
418 still light out! what gives? nap time again."
419   "Beep, beep"
420   "What the....oh no! not the.." I was cut off by a particularly
421 long (and loud) 
422   "BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!" issuing from the BOLO ECM field
423 kit in my duffle. No rodent would be caught dead without his 
424 BOLO alert, but, too late...........
425 
426 
427   "Oooh!" I groaned to no one in particular.. "My head!" I tried
428 to sit up, only to fall over into a crumpled heap. 
429   "Easy now!" a voice rang out "Those stun fields always leave 
430 you a little skittery for a while, take it easy!" 
431   "Whose there?" I said, not having yet opened my eyes.
432   "Names Larry. Larry Lemming."   "You must have just arrived."
433 
434   Larry Lemming told me the whole sordid tale.... 6000 small, 
435 loveable, furry rodents such as myself and Larry... had been 
436 ruthlessly hunted, captured, and imprisoned in a small brick 
437 building, with no toilets. Rodents were totured. Experiments
438 performed. Prisoners executed. Questions asked.   No one had any
439 idea why we were being held in this strange place, some no 
440 longer cared. There was always food. Lots of food. Strange,
441 though, for a prison....the building was air-conditioned.
442 
443   It was a late Saturday night when we found the method behind
444 this madness.  The building was warm that evening, everyone was
445 complaining about the heat. We had all grown an off-season coat
446 of long, warm fur...plenty of food, the air-conditioning kept
447 the air temperature in the low 30's. But not tonight... it was
448 hot! Air-conditioner had gone out. Seems some field mice gnawed
449 through an exposed piece of cabling protruding from the cabinet.
450 We couldn't find enuogh of them to bury.......... We wern't warm
451 for long, as the air-conditioner was removed and replaced. But 
452 this was a new unit. "Arctic-Air 830" said the nameplate. Our 
453 last was a "820", perhaps this prison was some sort of insane
454 Air-conditioner Beta test site......   
455   "hey, Habitrail, come look at this" a juvenile oposum called.
456 (I should explain that I was elected as the "commander" of the
457 colony...for the week)  "How odd, it seems to be an engraved 
458 metal plate...lesse..."
459  "PROPERTY CONTROL #A63411, McKane Industries, EARMUFF DIVISION"
460 
461   We planed our escape the next morning, it was actually quite 
462 simple. They fed us through a sort of grill, which they removed 
463 every day, so as to have access to the food tray, which they 
464 refilled. Tomorrow, they would have quite a surprise. Our oldest
465 bandicoot will scurry out the access hatch, up the unfortunate
466 feeder's body, and plant his teeth firmly into his juglar. 
467   It went beautifully. 6000 liberated rodents swarmed over the
468 countryside......
469   Just hours after the "coup", I was already kilometers away. My
470 little hamster legs can really move when the need arises! In
471 a grassy gnoll, I was relaxing..sipping a mint julep. What an 
472 experience! Now, time for a nap....
473   "BOOM."
474   "no, no... no alarm clock, remember?" Then it hit me. Alarm
475 clocks don't go "Boom".... then I saw them. Mini-BOLO's coming
476 over the hill. This time, they weren't firing stazers..those
477 were half-ton/sec sub-nuclear cannons firing! So, if McKane 
478 can't have earmuffs, he'll have bar-b-que rodent! Run little 
479 legs, RUN! 
480   I was too slow, and too tired. I dropped to the ground. I 
481 could see two BOLO's converging their turrets on me now. Oh,
482 why did I have to leave the inn! Though it wasn't as exciting
483 as this, my life at the inn was safe! The BOLO's fired. 
484 
485 ...
486 
487   "Am I dead?"
488   #No, in transit. Be patient, small one.#
489   "Who are you?"
490   #I am .....
491 Suddenly the lights went on. Shimmering into existance, I could 
492 see who it was. An old friend from the inn........    Piper.
493   He was exausted. Curling up by his legs, I would protect him
494 until he was rested, and feeling stronger. Just so long as he
495 didn't roll over on me...
496                                      Habitrail Harry
497 xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxX
498 
499 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
500   The piper lay for a few moments, then forced himself up.  That sound --
501 he turned round trying to orient himself and saw an automobile surrounded by
502 several familiar looking figures.  A movement next to his leg brought the 
503 piper's attention closer.  "Ah, little friend -- did you escape then?"  The
504 piper lifted the small hamster and let the animal burrow into the folds of
505 his plaid.  Looking around, the piper approached his friends near the car.
506   "Bard -- I don't really know what sort of reality we have ended up in this
507 time.  I left in a hurry, the pipes were not in tune, and I was trying to
508 save all mammalian life in the area.  Since Harry here did not escape the 
509 same disaster as either of us, I suspect some sort of meta-reality disaster
510 that is spreading echoes throughout the multiverse.  What is a tidal wave in
511 one reality is a massive earth-shock in another.  Harry escaped from a nuclear
512 explosion, and I suspect many of the animals here escaped from other natural
513 and man-made disasters."  The piper looked around him.  The group seemed o 
514 be on a level green plain, some artificial substance of some kind --
515 the auto and the group were standing on a silvery pathway that was flush with
516 the surroundings and covered with the same transparent green plastic coating.
517 In every direction were regular shapes of one sort or another.  Large black
518 buildings, much longer than they were high had metallic flying buttresses 
519 reaching down, each to a path.  Nearby, a path led to a circular hole in the
520 surface -- the plastic coating was missing in a circular area around the hole.
521   The path came up to the hole, then seemed to surround it and then flow through
522 to somewhere else.  The exposed area around the hole seemed to have almost a
523 woven texture where it was not covered with plastic.  Looking up, the piper 
524 could see no light source, just a uniform glow.  Looking back around, he 
525 suddenly felt a shift in perspective.  He turned to his friends and said,
526 "We're on a circuit board!"  
527 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
528 
529 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
530 A loud mental voice 'attracted' our attention.  #Well done, my friends.  Milchar, you have definitely learned the
531 lesson of KISS... your plan was elegant in its simplicity.  I beleive that you are worthy enough to receive this.
532 A tremendous b,alast of mental energy spwept over the group- pictures, places, things that were in dreams but never
533 thought of in waking.  Milchar's eyes go glassy for a moment... then it is done.  #Goodbye, my friends, I have some
534 work to do and a person to see..#  Everyone only half-hears, their minds nearly short-circuited by the blast.  
535 Milchar's eyes widen, and gain additional sparkle as he says, "The wine..."

538 I am a visitor to this reality. I have many humanly interesting stories
539 for you all. Here's one.
540 CHCOLATE ON TRIAL- HOW BITTER OR BITTERSWEET THE EVIDENCE?
541   All the testimony had been entered. The attorneys for the prosecution
542 and the defense had made their final summations. The jury had been dis-
543 missed to consider the evidence and reach their decision. For hours the
544 interested spectators crowding the coustroom had watched a steady stream
545 of witnesses offering testimony for and against the defendant. Now they
546 were waiting for the verdict.
547   The accused waited with them. Whether heat or from anxiety, the defen-
548 dant looked as if he would melt. As he waited, his mind raced back over
549 the hours of testimony. He thought of his own account of his earlier years.
550 THE DEFENDANTS TESTIMONY
551   In 1519, he had told the court, the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes
552 led an expedition into the heart of Mexico to capture gold and silver
553 treasures from the Aztec Indians. The emperor, Montezuma, along with his
554 Aztec subjects, thought Cortez and his soldiers were "white gods" risen
555 from the sea. They were welcomed and feasted and served a cold, bitter
556 drink, that was very popular with the Aztec hosts. It was called CACAH-
557 UATL.
558   They believed by drinking liquor from the seeds that universal knowledge
559 and wisdom were acquired. Montezuma himself believed that it not only gave
560 him strength and energy but stimulated his waning sexual powers as well!
561 Also, the cacao beans served as money.
562   Cacahuatl was to bitter for the European taste of the conquistadores,
563 but by adding sugar it was immensely improved. In Spain it was an immed-
564 iate success. Fashionable ladies liked it so much that they would bring
565 steaming cups to church with them. The secret of how to prepare it was
566 guarded "religiously" by Spanish monks for some time. But soon it spread
567 like wildfire to 
568 Italy, France,England, and all of Europe.            More to come, later!

589   THE PIPER SEEMS TO BE RESTORED TO SOMETHING LIKE HIS FORMER SELF.  HE'S 
590 TRYING TO GET DREAMTOUCHER TO GET SNOWRUNNER TO QUIT HARRASSING
591 HIS FRIEND THE HAMPSTER FROM THE INN AND HIS FRIENDS; LARRY LEMMING,
592 HABBITRAIL HARRY ET. ALL.
593   THIS IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE.  SHE DOES WHAT I ASK OF HER GENERALY ONLY
594 WHEN SHE FEELS LIKE IT.  THE BEST I CAN DO IS TRY TO CONVINCE HER THAT THEY 
595 ARE NOT LUNCH BEASTS.
596   THIS IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THAIR NOT APPEARING TO BE ANYTHING ELSE FOR
597 HER TO CHAISE.  THE NEW SCIENRY IS CERTAINLY AESTHETIC, BUT WHAT DOES IT DO?
598   UNDER THE BUTRICES THERE IS A BIT OF SPACE BETTEWEEN THEM AND THE WALL OF 
599 THE ODDLY FEATURELESS STRUCTURES THEY EXTEND FROM.
600   USING HIS FORREST SKILLS, DREAMTOUCHER CLIMBS TO THE TOP OF ONE OF THESE.

602 6809E".
603   SNOWRUNNER IS CHAISING ONE OF THE LARGER OF THE SMALL FURRY CRITTERS
604 AROUND AND AROUND IT.  AT ONE END HE RUNS PASSED A DISK, SET ON EDGE RESTING
605 ON TWO STOUT METAL LEGS.  ON ONE SIDE IS PRINTED ".1 M   TPC".
606   FROM HIS PERCH, ALL DREAMTOUCHER CAN SEE IS A VAST EXPANCE OF MORE OF THE 
607 SAME AS THERE CURRENT SURROUNDINGS.  HAVING MADE THIS ASSESMENT HE RETURNES 
608 TO THE GROUP.
609   "THIS IS TRUELY THE ODDEST PLACE I'VE SEEN YET.  THERE APPEARS TO BE NO
