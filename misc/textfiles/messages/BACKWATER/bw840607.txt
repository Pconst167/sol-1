20 This is The Doctor. (VERY MAD!!)  I don't know who got rid of my message here,
21 but I'm PISSED!!  It isn't very good etiquette to remove a message that isn't 
22 even yours!!  Tell me who you are!!  I want revenge.  Don't let it happen again.

26 He said the last statement quietly. Not as an outburst of anger, but as a 
27 statement of what will pass. Every muscle, nerve, and sinew was prepared to

32 HORRIFYING SCREAM IS CARRIED INTO THE MORNING SUNRISE AS THE DARK HORSE GIVES A

107 piper: I don't know if you got in the car or not.  If you want to accompany us, Great.  If not, good luck!
108 :::::::::
109 L'homme announced the car ready to go, and the bard proclaimed his gadgets also operational.  As they all began entering 
110 the car, a loud moaning and rumbling was heard, followed by severe shaking of the earth and other such disturbing events.
111 The nearby city was more-or-less leveled, and the surrounding topography was rather rearranged.  As they all regained their
112 feet, the bard made reference to a 'ricter scale' and a 5 or 6.  He then suggested that they make great haste to leave the
113 area, due to something called 'aftershocks'. They all hurried into the car (which was fortunately not damaged {more}) and 
114 began to drive toward the road.  Voyeur sat back and thought about something strange which had happened just befor the quake.
115 He had felt 'something', a kind of in-gathering of great forces, reminiscent of his experience in the auto-doc.  It had 
116 peaked just as the earthquake climaxed, then tapered off, until now he felt drained. (no, you dirty minds...). 
117 As the car hurried on, the bard was adjusting his mechanisms, preparatory to another reality shift.  Voyeur was uneasy;
118 that 'feeling' was coming back.  "Better speed it up, bard.  I think one of your 'aftershocks' is imminent."  As the bard
119 turned, probably to ask how voyeur knew, it struck.
120 The car started bouncing around on the road, with L'homme fighting the wheel trying to maintain control.  Suddenly a giant
121 crevasse opened directly in their path.  L'homme slammed on his brakes and tried to avoid it, but the car slid inexorably
122 into the hole.
123 As voyeur felt himself fall, he unconsciously gathered the impalpable energies, and 'twisted'.  The car seemed to be gripped
124 by some force even greater than that of the earthquake, was shaken, spun, and somehow turned inside-out (or so it felt).
125 It finally came to rest, and the battered and bruised passengers began to stir and attempt to regain scattered senses.
126 L'homme muttered 'now where am I.  My Car!" He began to get out to check for damage, when Dreamtoucher asked, "do I smell
127 formic acid?"
128 :::::::::
129 I love it!  Okay gang, there's a wealth of possibilities there.  And I didn't even rip off poor RZ this time!

138   Well, I think that all our story lines are getting a bit weak, so I will 
139 refrain from making things more complicated.

141   Morby steped out of his room, chipper as ever.  He looked in suprise at the
142 rather confused crowd.
143   " Yes, I know your plans.  The noise of you talking about them woke me up."
144   He walked over to a table and sat down.
145   " I have three remarks - 1) I'll be glad to go   2) Can some one lend me 
146 a short sword    3) Has anyone seen Dawg?

151     Fred thought for a moment at Morby's last question.  Dawg?  DAWG!  I forgot
152 that I set that mini-bolo for approxomite dog size!   I rushed out and tuned
153 my homer.  Over beyond those trees.  I look over and see the mini bolo........
154 ................... With a large dog riding on top!
155      Blast! More bugs in the software.  Oh well, at least this was the right
156 time to find out.  No damage done to either dog or bolo, so I readjusted and
157 stored my machine, and led Dawg back to his master.
158      "Now for more pressing matters.  I deal in wepons occasionally, but I 
159 usually stay out of the direct confrontation. If you all remember I got here
160 originally by YOUR attacking ME.  And since it seems enough of you want to
161 personally dismember Gaius, have at it.   Who's with me for the resupplying?"
162     He then went to his table, sat and added, "By the way, any of you killers
163 need to rent a Bolo?"

194 absolutely nothing when we pop back into Galifrean space."  "Great." says

211   Morby looked at the Warrior.
212   " I prefer a shortsword, because they are easier to use when backstabing.
213 Also they are the favored weapon of my type, and you know what my type is!"
214   Morby pulled a pipe from the a fold in his cloak, and some pipeweed from
215 a pouch on his belt.  After no one offered to light it for him, the pipe
216 lit itself.  He then rested his feet on the table.
217   " You like the pipe?  It and the special weeds are my only magical items."
218   Dawg, looked rather run down rested came in and rested at Morby's feet.
219   " Before we leave on the quest for beverages, lets have a little talk 
220 about religion..."

224 ->Milchar: you were correct with the chessboard solution. (so correct,
225 do you have my source book?)
226 Regarding the coffee/sugar problem, since it is obviously impossible to
227 divide 14 into 3 odd groups, it is probably something offbeat like
228 drinking one cup black, then split the 14 into 7 & 7 for the other two.
229 Eve/odd infinity.  I'm inclined to assume infinity is a prime number, and
230 is therefore an odd number, since the only even prime is 2.
231 (aside: I wrote an assembler program for the 370/138 at school, and got a
232 printout of all the primes up to 1,000,000.  Got some funny looks from
233 the computer operators and my BAL instructor, though.  Sigh.

237 Gaius laughed as he watched the Innhabitants on his interreality scanner. His plan was going just as planned. They
238 were all going to be so busy trying to kill him that they would never know what hit them. The weakening of the 
239 reality-structure in the vicinity of Innisfall continued on scedule. Perhaps he should report the use of maxwell's
240 demon to straighten up the Inn. N might get a laugh out of it. Then again, maybe not; N was so unpredictable.
241 Ah, that's it, thought Gaius, I'll just stir them up a little more...

243 "Your mothers married their fathers!"
244 The cry from outside the Inn caused every head in the place to turn. "Hey!  Wimps! Come an' get me!" The patrons 
245 all rushed to the door to see who could be so bold. Standing before the Inn, under a strangely dark noonday sky, was
246 Gaius. "Come on, I'll take on the lot of ya," he cried, brandishing his shuriken. His form was far enough from the
247 Inn that none of the charging horde saw the faint smile that played across his lips as he watched them surge 
248 foreward. tThis ought to be fun, he thought.

302 ed die, multiplied the result by e, then by itself to the pi multiplied
303 
by the square root of negative one times and got a result that he was almsot
304 (but not quit) totaly dissatisfied with. Taking the sign then suming it
305 (n= -infinity to n= infinity) didn't help either. Going back to the stopwatch,
306 und the whole process had taken precisely 6.02 X 10^-23 Meta-milennia,
307 idn't understand what the 7734 that it meant. Going to normal time function
308 witching back from military time) he found it was about time, rolled the die
309 nce more for good luck, and descended into the chaos (looking for a good name

326 Quizmaster:I amay have your source book, but I doubt it.  So many of such books use the same classic puzzles over 
327 and over again, anyway.  That particular puzzle I remember solving some time ago, so it wasn't too strenuous.  What
328 we need are some new puzzles....  How's this?
329 Another grouping puzzle.... The letters of the alphabet can be grouped into four distict classes:  The first 13 letters

337 Milchar stirs, awakened by K-9 stelling him, "Pre-programmed co-ordinates established."  The Doctor was already up,
338 twisting dials and pushing buttons on the console as he gazed upon the viewscreen.  "Ahhh, Good 'morning', Milch!  
339 We've landed, I'm just affirming our placement.  Yes... we're just the proper distance.  No one could have tracked us
340 here with the Temporal Wave Displacer working.  Messes up the Time Waves so that there are no relative constants too
341 track us by.  The controllers at the palace must be having a whale of a time trying to figure out the Time Waves that 
342 seem to come fromt the statue on their front lawn."  Milchar grinned, and then turned about to find his Chest.  His
343 hands flitter about, and finally rest upon a small 3 by 3 by 5 inch sliver box.  Cautiously, he opens it.  Golden 
344 mists swirl in the air and settle in the far corner of the room, and materializes into a very large chest whose lid

371 The Innkeeper sat in front of the Inn staring out at the shambles that once 
372 was his courtyard. "Why I do bother? They destroy the Inn and the 
373 surroundings, then rush off to who knows where without even paying their tab 
374 or helping to clean up the mess."
375 "Even my barmaid seems to have deserted me." 
376 "Maybe I should just close this place up and move to someplace where there is 
377 less violence and killing. Someplace where the darkness does not wash over 
378 the land." Looking over at the Rowan tree, he thinks yes, maybe I should 
379 close it up and move on. There's not much left here for me.

385 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ah ha!, they thought.  We feel a presence.
386 Something to attack and feed on!! Alerting the rest of the hoard and their cousins, they swarm to bite and sting.
387 The termites, tired of trying to eat and destory the Inn, recieve the message from their cousin ants, join to attack
388 the figure in black (Ninja).
389 A sense of purpose fills the ants.  No longer relegated to digging tunnels for the larger brethern, they can oin

435   AS THEY MADE THAIR WAY BACK UPSTAIRS, A MOST PECULIAR LOUD TEARINIG SOUND COULD BE HEARD.    WITH ALL THE CARNAGE 
436 UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS AND OUTSIDE (ALL IN THE MYSTERIOS PROCESS OF REVERSING
437 ITSELF) ONE ANT HAD REMAINED ALIVE.  WHEN THEMNAX HAD HASTILY DEPARTED FOR THE
438 CELLARS, HIS SHIP HAD BEEN PHASED IN AND ITS OUTER LOCK OPEN.
439   IN THE DUST AND CONFUSION, ONE OF THE MURAUDING SUPER-ANTS, HAD BLUNDERED ABOARD!
440   IT HAD AIMLESSLY TORE INTO THE CONTROL COMPARTMENT, FIRST SETTING OFF A MASTERBOT
441 WHICH HAD BEEN STOED IN THE AIRLOCK/CARGO HOLD.  IT HAD BEEN LAST PROGRAMED TO PICK
442 WILD TOMATOES.  IT ROLLED TO A STOP IN THE CENTER OF THE INN.  SEEING NOTHING WHICH RESEMBLED TOMATOE PLANTS, IT SIMPLY 
443 SAT THERE IDLEY.  IT WAS ONLY THEN THAT DISASTER (FOR THEMNAX AT LEAST) STRUCK.
444   THE LESS THAN GENIUS CHETTENOID BLUNDERED INTO ONE OF THE SPACIAL VECTOR TRIMPOTS.  THE SHIP TRIED TO MOVE WITHOUT 
445 HAVING BEEN SHADOW PHASED AND STILL INTERSECTING THE INN'S EAST WALL!
446   BY THE TIME THEMNAX REEMERGED INTO THE INN'S COMMON, THERE WAS NO SHIP, NO ANT AND A RATHER
447 LARGE HOLE WARE IT HAD INTERSECTED THE WALL.  WITH THE CHILDREN OF MAXWELL AND FINAGLE ON THE JOB, THE DAMMAGE TO THE 
448 INN WAS QUICKLY REVERSED WITH NOT THE SLIGHTEST EVIDANCE IT HAD EVER OCCURED.  UNFORTUNATLY THERE WAS NO LONGER THE 
449 SLIGHTEST EVIDENCE THEMNAX'S SHIP HAD EVER OCCURED EITHER!
450  (EXCEPT FOR HIS OWN AND HIS ARTIFACT'S CONTINUED EXISTANCE).  SINCE THE ENERGY FROM THIS EVENT HAD TO GO SOMEWARE AND 
451 IT HAD NOT BEEN RELEASED AS PHYSICAL ENERGY IN THE REALITY OF THE INN, SEVERAL THINGS HAPPENED SIMULTANIOSLY.  THE 
452 DOCTOR'S TARDIS'S SETTINGS WERE KNOCKED OFF A BIT (SORRY DOCTOR, ET.C.. ACCORDING TO THE SHOW, EVERY LITTLE RIPPLE IN 
453 SPACE-TIME COSMOSE SEEMES TO HAVE THIS EFFECT SO I'M GUESSING IT WILL HAPPEN HERE AS WELL).  AN EARTHQUAKE SEEMS TO BE
454 TAKING PLACE IN THE BLIGHT WARE L'HOMME'S CAR AND OCCUPANTS WERE LAST SEEN AND EVEN GIAUS IS KNOCKED ACCROSS THE ROOM BY
455 A SHORT FROM HIS CONSOLE.  (THE ACTUAL AMMOUNT OF DAMMAGE CAUSED WILL PROBABLY BE MINIMAL IN MOST CASSES AS IT WAS 
456 SPREAD SO WIDELY.  SUIT YOURSELVES AS TO HOW MUCH AND EVEN IF AT ALL.  INFINITY HAS NOT(!) BEEN SHATTERED, JUST A FEW 
457 RIPPLES SPREADING EVER OUTWARD)

475 OUT. - MAX
476 ################################################################################
477 ARCHER: the only "regular" who's spelling and grammar are even *CLOSE* to being 
478 as bad as yours is Themnax, and he is at least readable! I would suggest that
479 you not be so preemptory with other people's characters. For one thing, the
480 apprentice has not bothered to go outside as no attack on the inn can POSSIBLY 
481 succeed.
482 ALL: the apprentice is getting a bit put out at the hack and slash mentalities
483 being displayed by most of the inhabitants of the inn. 
484 	RESOLVED: We, the "old-timers" of the inn, hereby resolve that we shall
485 not attempt to do battle in or near the inn. Since Backwater. like the Twilight
486 Zone, is a realm of the imagination, if we ignore the attacks they cannot harm 
487 us.
488 	Anyone else care to "take the pledge"?
489 .....................
490 	The apprentice called to the others, "Ignore that person, if he attacks
491 Maxwell and his cohorts will take care of the matter. If he does not, what 
492 boots it?"
493 	He turned back to the innkeeper, with whom he was settling his tab.
494 ................................the apprentice..................................
495 ps. In case you were not aware, the Inn was originally a place to swap stories
496 and rest between adventures. NOT a place to HAVE adventures!
497 ................................................................................
498 	The bard shook his head to clear it & immediately regretted doing so.
499 "I think we goofed! That wasn't an aftershock, it was the main quake, the first
500 one was a PRE-shock! We shifted before it peaked, but it was on it's way past
501 9.4 when we left!"
502 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
503 5 or 6 indeed! On the richter scale 6.5 means the quake expended as much energy 
504 as a 20 kiloton bomb. That is TOTAL energy. Thus a 5 or 6 quake won't cause much
505 damage except at the epicenter. Of course, since the scale follows a LOGARITHMIC
506 progression....

514 Archer: your spelling is part of the problem, but the way you omit punctuation
515 is the _real_ problem. Punctuation exists to seperate phrases & ideas so as to
516 clarify meaning. Without proper punctuation it is often impossible to tell
517 what is meant.
518 	In your last msg the following are there errors I found:
519 meant-instead of meant/thing-instead of things/no period after crane
520 no question mark after "got it"/no ? after message/no comma after OHHH
521 refrering instead of refering/misstakes instead of mistakes/to instead of too
522 no period after down/eather instead of either/(for clarity it should have been 
523 "either one" as otherwise there is no referent for the word!)
524 no comma after eather/no period after die (note: there MUST be a better way to 
525 word that sentence. It is _CLUMSY_!)/mouths instead of months
526 thise instead of this (and the in following "thise" is unnecessary)
527 "he only he" should be either "he, only he" or "only he"
528 Gallafra is not the correct spelling!
529 Finally, in regard to your postscript. Are _YOU_ trying to tell _US_ to do
530 better? Or did you mean "I will try to do better in the future"?
531 If you meant the latter, well, it wasn't what you wound up saying!

534   Well, I seem to be alone again.  I escaped from a tidal wave, the others
535 experienced an earthquake!  (see the end of drive B)  Oh well, reality is
536 determined by consensus, and a consensus of one is not too binding.  a
537 As a compromise, I offer this -- tidal wave caused by incredibly massive
538 earthquake.  (Actually I was hoping for something like the Missoula Flood,
539 but I'll settle for that.  At any rate, the piper has escaped with a collection
540 of small furry animals (refugees from LeRoy's earmuff factory?) and is 
541 presently unconcious in an unkown reality.  Is anyone else with me?  If so,

546   I quite agree with the resolve.  the inn is not for arena purposes, and I
547 hope the rest agree with me.  I turn to the warrior and explain how I first
548 arrived here.  "A while back, the patrons of the inn decided to eliminate
549 the inport of hi-tec wepons into this reality.  Unfortunatly for me, I was
550 running a used bolo lot at the time.  I did deal in the wepons, but I was
551 only retail, not wholesale.  I wasn't worried about an attack from them, because
552 there is only one thing that can harm the later models. Unfortunatly the Ninja
553 uses that one thing as one of his main wepons: a Ford stickshift.  The attack
554 was even more complicated by the arrival of hostile religious fanatics.  Well,
555 the lot was destroyed, and finally after a LONG while they got used to me.
556    and here I am.

563 Dream Toucher (who looked like he read part but not all of the previous
564 messages) went on a different note, and voyeur then built on what dream
565 toucher had written. Bard follows after voyeur, and here I am. Sorry Piper,
566 I would have gladly gone with your story, but the passengers in the car seem
567 to want to go elsewhere. Since I would rather bend reality than break what
568 little structure holds our group together, I must go on with the others. If

571 "My poor Mustang!", cried L'homme. "What next?", he asked Carrol Shelby and
572 no one else in particular. "How are we going to get out of here? Am I ever
573 going to get back to Tek? Why me???", L'homme seemed to be the most upset by
574 the recent incidents. It was apparent he wasn't used to such things. His world
575 was so much different. The others knew so much more about what was happening
576 around them. Only his mechanical abilities, and his car, seemed to give him
577 even the slightest leverage against all that was happening to him. "I am in
578 a world I don't quite understand. I am confronted with things I can not 
579 explain. I am meeting people I can't even describe. Even the disasters that
580 befall me are unlike anything I have experienced before." L'homme said with
581 a voice full of dispair. "Now it seems we are in quite a bit of trouble. And
582 all the engine rebuilding experience in the world isn't going to help! What
583 can I DO to help us get out of here?"
584 With that L'homme sank down by the front tire and just sat there looking at
585 nothing in particular. The others were some what shocked by this sudden out-
586 burst of emotion from L'homme. "We are all a long way from home", said Bard.
587 "Let's see what we can do to get out of here.", he continued. The others then
588 set forth trying to figure out their present condition, and what they could
589 do it get out of this particular predicament, and eventually, get home. They
590 left L'homme alone. "When he is ready, he will tell us", said voyeur, with the
591 others agreeing.
