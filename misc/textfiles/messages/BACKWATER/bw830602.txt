6                     THIS SYSTEM.
7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privatly owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system.
10 It is intended that the system be normally used for messages and
11 advertisments by the users. As the system is privatly owned, I retain the
12 right to remove any and all messages which I may find offensive
13 to me. Additionally because of the limited size of the system, it will be
14 periodically purged of older messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
15 The saved information will be cycled to drive 'B' while the information on
16 drive 'B' will be archived, and a fresh disk will be installed in drive 'A'.

25 Dear Lady d,
26      I thank you for your kind comments in regard to the system.
27 While I do not really consider it in that low of a regard, I often
28 use that type of comment to interest people in the system. There are
29 many BBS's in the area, and as such There is need to be different to
30 gain more then a small following of users. BWMS is currently on its
31 4th major set of users. I consider this to be an advantage, as because of
32 the format this movment of users is possible. As one group has worn
33 down on things to discuss another set comes in to bring new life to the 
34 system. The continual change is the very lifeblood of BWMS. This would
35 only be possible because of its structure. YES! small is beautiful.
36      In regard to the consideration of words for dragon, indeed I would
37 have to admit that it would seem to be a rather off balance transfer.
38 Yet perhaps something can be worked out. Initial calculations indicate
39 that it would be about four to five inches of paper to run out all of
40 the listings. Can you accept information in some other form? I can
41 through arangement provide the information in a number of different 
42 disk formats (assuming you can read disks.) If you are unable to read
43 disks, then it becomes a bit more difficult. I could perhaps provide
44 the paper form though it would take time to print it out. If however
45 the dragon you offer were marvelous enough, I would consider it 
46 worthwhile. Though the disk format would carry the costs of the disks
47 mostly, the paper format carries the costs of the time mostly.
48 Alas. What's a CISTOP to do. I would like to persue the matter if you
49 are still interested however. You can contact me here, or at my office
50 at U.S. DIGITAL, INC. 5699-D S.E. International Way, Milwaukie, Or 97222
51 (503) 654-xxxx. Since my wall over my desk is currently empty (We just
52 opened the office!) it would be a wounderful thing to have fill the 
53 emptiness there.

57 Bought your ticket already, d?  Doggone.  I accept your compliment with

63      Certainly, Dave, MY dragons can coexist with gentle creatures!  But
64 unicorns keep this solemn, mystical air about them, quite unvarying to draw,
65 whereas my dragons are adventuresome, intelligent and playful in my quick
66 sketches, which lend themselves well to humourous situations.  In the more
67 serious portraits, I'm learning to portray my emotions by their expressive
68 faces, and thus my dragons help me...Here is my gift; it is but simple:

147 Are we using up disks fast or what?  Thought:  If this system can hold
148 around 630 lines of text and each line can have 80 characters, then
149 the total amount of info on each disk is about 50K bytes.  I've never
150 heard of a minifloppy that has a capacity even close to 50k.  The 
151 closest was an 80k apple or trs-80, I think.....   How are these
152 disks formatted?

155 d, regret fills my heart at the news of your leaving. Our conversation has
156 been a fruitful one.  Alas, it is a shame that I cannot share in the beauty
157 of the dragon you have drawn yesterday. But, I have a very limited window and
158 no printer.  I am sure I shall see your work someday.  I too, admire dragons;
159 but I hold the knowledge that there are very ferocious(?) beasts out there
160 in dragon form.
161 I am curious, will the person who doctored my sayings of late please speak
162 up? I say what I wish, and do not need people changing my words!!!
163    Again d, you shall be missed.  Your words have given a new brightness to
164 this place.  Shall we see you again?
165    Darth, only you could be so bold (my aplogies, I couldn't resist). I, 
166 AKONIS, do NOT bow down to anyone other than those who have proven thier 
167 worthiness for such a priviledge!!  I you wish to force people to bow to false
168 Gods, then speak with ME first!
169  d, I cannot stop expressing my sadness. Even so, if I do not say it and leave
170 now, I shall never be able to muster myself again. You have made me happy.
171 For that I thank you.  I can imagine that your dragons must be outstanding!
172 Return to our Inn again, will you?
173        Akonis

175 Oh, mighty Cistop: your system is an honorable one. Do not feel it is without
176 honor!

183      Akonis, my soul aches at the parting, as well!  Your words are so
184 generous--I blush with abashed pleasure to think that my presence
185 means happiness for you and others of this enchanted land!  Yes, I will
186 indeed return, somehow, someday...Please, Akonis, you have not told me
187 why you bear this name nor what it means; this girl has not flown yet!
188 You wish a dragon?  I will sketch one appropriate to your name, if you
189 will honour me with a swift messenger to carry it back to you...?
190      Excuse me, Innkeeper:  your whereabouts being duly noted, I will
191 find you after I have left the Backwater Inn.  Disks I cannot use, sadly,
192 but in return for the papers you offer, I will give you the best fruitage
193 of my hands.  Speaking of which, tell me a little more about yourself so
194 that YOUR dragon's personality can be formed more clearly in my mind!
195      Ah, you speak to me at last, Grey Ghost!  What of the name you once
196 sought; and have you found refreshment from your walk through the fields?
197      Pioneer, I am delighted to hear your voice grow mellower as the
198 peacefullness of the land begins to influence you.  Welcome to our Inn!
199 From listening to your comments, I've gained respect for your judgment,
200 and therefore am flattered that you uphold my cause, and that you find
201 such redeeming qualities in my humble soul.  I sense that you do not toss
202 compliments out haphazardly, so thank you!  Do speak up again, sir.
203       Tron, I must decline your offer, though I thank you.  My days of
204 D&D have become history.  Your frequent queries for age makes me wonder:
205 just exactly how old are YOU?  (Spare us the jokes, by the way.)

273 ****************************************************************
274 Dear lady d,
275      I as well am disheartened by you leaving yet once more this
276 land of ours. When you appear here the world changes and shifts
277 from the gray and brown of the wastes and blooms green with vitality.
278 Though I love this land, it is only with great difficulty that I am
279 able to interreact with it, for though I can see the land in all its
280 glory, I must stuggle to  add my touch to it without
281 tarnishing the brightness or bruising the tender buding shoots.
282 I come from a world of sand, stone, and metal where I must deal in
283 harsh realities of that world. By this does my written image be
284 controlled, which is the reason for the difficulty in expressing
285 the visceralness to the depth I would like. (I suggest your unabridged
286 dictionary) Indeed I am so intent to pass on that which I see
287 and believe that I rush past the beauty that can be there to behold.
288 That which I write is a direct translation as close as it can be,
289 of my thoughts as they occur at the time that I write. I dislike
290 returning to change these words for though they are often disjointed
291 and confused they are a direct representation of what I have thought.
292 Forgive me a moment while I digress to the harsh realities to more
293 fully expand on the physical aspect of that which is me. A Taurus.
294 I am 33 years of age. I am 5' 9". I weigh aprox 145. I have medium
295 length brown hair which if is not kept continuously combed ends up
296 as a curly mop. Blue eyes. I tend to be slightly sloppy in appearance,
297 or as some would call it 'comfortable'. I have a standard regulation
298 mustash. Of course in all things, physical appearances are only part
299 of the description of the person behind the name, and this certianly
300 is the case with me. While you know of part of me by my writings here,
301 this is only that part which I allow to appear to this world. You 
302 may gain a better insight to yet another aspect to know my standing
303 inthe cold world without. I live in an apartment, I am single, I use
304 to work for another company (Edge Technology) but I recently quit to
305 start my own company with my partner (U.S. DIGTAL) of which I am
306 chairman and product development manager. While this is is the person
307 that presents himself to the world, there is also the inner self which
308 few have access to. While each of us is reluctant to present this part
309 of themselves to the world there are means by which we do this to those
310 who understand. You release this part thru your dragons. I have searched
311 for many ways to release this part of me, and still I find them wanting
312 for lack of a full accounting of that which is me. Consider my friend
313 friend the believer who's emotions run as mine, Yet must I step outside
314 of myself to even associate with that type of writting. Above all else
315 I must be in control of myself and my life, yet I treasure my friends
316 for the friendship they give. I do not like to impose upon them without
317 cause or invitation for that is what I would expect from them in return.
318 I love the beauty that can be found in the world, but my eyes are drawn
319 to the natural beauty and not the artificial, guilded, or surface beauty
320 that is so often presented. Intelligence above all else do I value. I hold 
321 no favor to the flighty, the boarish, or thoughtless. I do not walk this
322 world on stilts made from my boastings, but rather I build my mountains
323 a stone at a time so that non may destroy them with ease and all can
324 see and admire them.
325 I do hope that this provides you with a better understanding so that
326 you may instill that which is truely me into the creation you have so
327 graciously allowed me to have the chance to request.

333 THE DISK IS A 5 INCH DISK SOFT SECTORED FORMATTED WITH 18 SECTORS
334 PER TRACK 128 BYTES PER SECTOR 35 TRACKS PER DISK. THE FIRST SECTOR
335 IS RESERVED FOR DISK STATUS INFORMATION. THE DATA IS PLACED ON THE
336 DISK IN THE FORM OF ONE LINE PER SECTOR. EVEN IF ONLY ONE CHARACTER
337 (OR EVEN NONE) IS PLACED ON THE LINE IT STILL TAKES UP THE WHOLE
338 SECTOR OF 128 BYTES. THERE IS NO OPERATING SYSTEM AS MOST WOULD
339 VIEW IT, THE DISK IS SIMPLY READ AS SECTOR 1 BEING THE FIRST LINE
340 AND SECTOR 629 BEING THE LAST LINE. IT IS FILLED SEQUENCIALY STARTING
341 WITH SECTOR 1. (SECTOR 0 IS THE RESERVED SECTOR)
342 ALSO THERE CAN BE UP TO 128 CHARACTERS MAXIMUMIN EACH LINE NOT 80.
343 THE MAXIMUM ENTERABLE LINE LENGTH CAN BE SET VIA THE 'MA' COMMAND.
344 ALTHOUGH IT WILL SAY INVALID PARAMETER FOR MARGINS ABOVE 80, IT WILL

446    I have an opinion about the black holes.
447    The definently have a finite depth. When something enters one,
448 it goes iuntil it hits the knot or core. Then, it quickly presses
449 itself into the knot. So, it one enters, it never comes out. But,
450 if you think about it, it doesn't really have a finite depth.
451 How can we prove that the object didn't fly by it so quickly that
452 it didn't get a chance to hit it? I don't know myself.....

458 Ahhhh...  Tron, tHou makes misguided assumptions on the fiber of black
459 holes!  A black hole is not of infinite depth.  Also, it is a popular myth
460 that black holes trap everything inside them.  Actually, things CAN get
461 out! Everything in this reality vibrates to the order of
462 10 e-33cm/Length of the object.  This includes the almighty black holes!
463 Now, when they vibrate, they temporarily enter a state of flux where the
464 singularity no longer protects the universe from the black hole. In order
465 to make use of this, you must travel VERY fast, but it's possible.
466   d, I would be honored with a gift from you. In return, I have prepared
467 the fruit of MY specialty. Speak to me on another BBS, will you? My alias 
468 is John Martin  (#109 on Bit Bucket).
469   I look forward to hearing your soothing words in a quieter IInn.

474  My dearest lady of the dragons,
475      Forgive me for not answering you sooner, but I was
476      elsewhere and was unable to responed. Although I
477      normally have gone by the name of the exwarior, I
478      have also gone by the name of Leo the Bull when this
479      land metamorphoses in your presence. You deduce my
480      thoughts with amazing clairity. Yes, I have become
481      disenchanted with the game. Once I was proud to serve,
482      but now I no longer am able to retain those feelings.
483      I retain the trapings of the warrior both in name and
484      dress as an albatross of my past to remind me of that
485      which I would soon forget that I may not return to that
486      life I detest. It is not that I loath a true defense from
487      aggression, but rather I dislike the aggression that is
488      clothed as defense. It is this reason that I ware the
489      name I have chosen and forsaken the profession I can
490      no longer serve.

503 There was a young poet named Dan,
504 Whose poetry never would scan.
505         When told this was so,
506         He said, "Yes, I know.
507 It's because I try to put every possible syllable into that last line that I can."

510 To: Akonis  From: Tron  Re: Black holes
511   Yes, that is all true./ But, how does one go about getting
512 this information? The nearest black hole is over 50 light years
513 away. How do they measure gravity and stuff like that?

607      Do not fear, O Innkeeper, that your hands could damage the young
608 buds that sprout in your land; I sense the gentleness deep within you,
609 yearning for expression.  Come, explore the awakening of spring in the
610 land:  amble through the meadows and step quietly into the forgotten
611 orchards...a cherry tree, resplendent in white, favors you with a
612 soft, leisurely shower of blossoms...a honeysuckle thicket teases your
613 senses, and you pause for a moment to savor the evocative scent; ahh,
614 look, my friend:  a fawn nestles nearby in the brush...she watches
615 you with huge, liquid eyes...the chortle of a stream captures your
616 attention, as the sun climbs higher, and you stop to rest where the
617 water can tickle your toes, lapping at your feet in a soothing rhythm...
618      Awake, sire--guests have arrived, and they demand your attention,
619 but do not forget this early-morning stroll, for the land simply begs
620 to be discovered!  Turn your hand to shaping it, O Innkeeper, and the
621 visitors of quality will rejoice at the refreshment and tranquility found
622 just outside the back doors of this unique place, the Backwater Inn!
623 You build with stones, you said, but you can learn other ways...Help me
624 in the weaving of your little retreat:  begin by inviting your guests out
625 of the heated discussions that invariably occur in the pub, and instead
626 introduce them to the peaceful, romantic beauty of the land...
