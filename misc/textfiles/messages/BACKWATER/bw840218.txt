31 SOMEWHAT INCONVIENIENT, IT RELIEVES A FEW WORRIES.

35 DOM: CAN YOU READ MINDS? THE OPINION YOU EXPRESSED IS ALMOST EXACTLY
36 MY OWN ON ALL THE ISSUES YOU DISCUSSED. (NOTE 'ALMOST')

45 ********************************************************************************Well, Well, Well,
46      You want to meet an opened minded Christian? I'm here. Any questions? I 
47 think that some of the veiws expressed by you "heathens" (previous word entered in fun)
48 are pretty closed minded. You say that that student's Christianity was do to
49 Thanfullnes towards the west? Rubbish! It makes no sense. You have not even
50 considered any alternate ideas. Personally, I would consider myself open minded
51 (although I'm open to debate on that). But, I can't see any open minded athiests
52 out there. Well, I have to be leaving you, so good night.

54 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
55 And yet another corner heard from! Prepare yourself for a shock, DOM: I, with whom you agreed so heartily, am also a 




56 <*GASP!*> Christian.(Albeit, as I have said before, a wierd one.) Even though this means I myself believe that being a
57 Christian is the best thing to be, it is also my belief that God gave us free will. Therefore, if God saw fit to make us 
58 capable of choosing other religions, or no religion, who am I to deny others the right
59 to believe as they will? The best thing for a true Christian to do is to see that his side is heard along with the others',
60 and to live and act in such a way as to show what a good thing Christianity is. Unfortunately, being human, many mistakenly
61 allow the fact that they see themselves as "right" to serve as justification for oppressing and suppressing those who 
62 disagree.(This last applies to both Christian and non-Christian alike.)
63 Christ told us to scatter the seeds of his teachings widely,not concerning ourselves with where they fell or whether they 
64 took root. Those for whom the Word is meant will recieve it, and the others (which, it is implied, are the majority) will not.
65 If you don't want the seeds, please don't let the behavior of a misguided few lead you into prejudice against all of those
66 who do.

77 Did Someone Say Pain?
78 
79   Dear Mad Actor and Man In Gray,
80   
81  New Wave has nothing to do with pain or self destruction.
82 I think the style you are refering to so Ignorantly is Punk Rock.
85   New Wave is just A 'new' style of music.
86 And there will be people who oppose it as
87 sure as there are people that appose the
88 computer revolution.
89   Some people, usually conservatives, just don't
90 want to give into change.
91 
92 I hope this is not the case with you two or any others on this
93 board.
97   Long live New Wave!!!

104 FOTI:
105 Yep.Uh-huh.That's right. You'll notice that I apologised for my unfortunate statement concerning New Wave.
106 Personally, I welcome change (although not for it's own sake alone).

110 Ah ha! The Mad Actor is a Trekkie!
111 The Mad Actor/TMA/Tycho Magnetic Anomaly
112 If I was verbally creative enough, I would do something interesting
113 with the relationship between TMA/TMA and the seeds for a new
114 level of evolution a la ideas; unfortunately I find it extremely
115 difficult to express myself coherently (particularly in the flowing
116 styles so common here) so I just drop bits of semi-noise here and there.
117 Which is why I am the
118 000000000000000000000000voyeur0000000000000000000000000000000000000
119      The Poet's eyes had taken on a decidedly crazed look as he deposited his weaponry on the table before him, but at
120 the sound of the Piper's music he began to calm a bit. An unreadable expression crossed his face as he listened to the
121 playing and watched the debris of an earlier night's conflict fade into another corner of reality.
122      "Y'know, my friends, if we are to seek after the person or persons who are behind all this mayhem, we might be wise
123 to enlist the aid of that gent with the pipes over there."
124      "What, that windbag?," Graymalken's daughter snorted derisively.
125      "Yes. That FINE MUSICIAN over there is, I believe good for much more than mere entertainment and janitorial duties.
126 If I'm not mistaken, he plays the music of the Gael Gate; a skill I'd thought lost forever (if that word has any meaning
127 here). With his songs he can access freely all of the Myriad realities! This, my friends, is an ally we can hardly afford
128 to be without!"
129 
130      So saying, the Poet lurched to his feet, his weapons somehow disappearing into his robe as he did so, and began
131 picking his way through the crowded common room towards the table where sat the Piper...

137   With a pained look, the piper paid for the voyeur's drink then turned to
138 the bard.
139   "Really now, I'm not sure about this.  I distinctly remeber hearing that 
140 the way it goes is ... 'He who calls the tune must pay the piper.'  Where does
141 it say the piper pays?"
142    Pouring a jack of ale into his parched throat, the piper turned to a person
143 sitting some distance to one side.
144   "Deborah?  Yes, I also play the pipes in mundane reality, although with 
145 much less flashy effects.  Do your friends play with any organized groups 
146 here?  I do not, as I cannot afford the  investment of the time."
147    Downing another jack of ale, the piper winded the pipes again, and in honor
148 of those desparately seeking to start a religious argument began a very minor
149 piebroch -- "The Desparate Battle."
150 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
151 Dirty Ol' Man - I don't want to be rude or anything but your 
152 ideas do sound like an old mans. Just like my father in fact.
153     Sex is just as important and as natural as eating or 
154 sleeping or performing any other natural function. You 
155 wouldn't argue that I shouldn't eat or sleep while my father 
156 pays the bills would you? Why is sex different.
157     People make too big a deal about sex. It is fun and 
158 relaxing and it helps me get closer to people. What's so 
159 bad about that? I agree with Evan about the birth control 
160 cause thats just being responsible. I don't want to have a 
161 baby. I just want to have some fun. Isnt being a teenager 
162 hard enough without always fretting about being horny? 
163 Maybe I'm different than other girls but I just couldn't 
164 stand going around clenching my teeth and being frustrated 
165 all the time. I don't think its healthy.
166     Tell me ol' man, now that you've told me how a girl 
167 should live her sex life according to her fathers rules, 
168 how old were you the first time? Did you wait until you 
169 were away from your parents because you respected them 
170 so much. Or didn't they care what you did because you are 
171 a boy.
172     If it sounds like I'm being nasty I'm sorry. I don't 
173 want to make anybody mad at me but I get so angry with how 
174 unfair it is. Sex is a partnership and it can't be good for 
175 one partner and evil for the other. That's not fair.

180 Piper, my friend, *I* am paying for the drink...

185 I somehow doubt that you can play my next song on the pipes, but feel
186 free to try. However, I must warn you that if your playing gets us lynched,
187 I will hold you FULLY responsible.
188 The tune is "Penny Lane", I'm afraid that I have no idea who wrote these

191 Middle-Earth
192 In Middle-earth there is a tavern on the Eastern Road.
193 There travelers will find its tables full of cheer;
194 And when the innkeeper brings the beer,
195 He may bend an ear.
196 
197 In Middle-earth well hidden in the Old Forest's trees
198 Tom Bombadil maintains a house of cobbled stone,
199 To which he brings Goldberry home
200 From the River's edge -- to his bed.
201 
202 Middle-earth, beneath the Stars, below the Sun,
203 Where the seedling of Telperion is planted;
204 Elsewhere back
205 
206 In Middle-earth there is a Hobbit in a hobbit-hole.
207 He keeps it clean although it's dug into the ground.
208 And though he spends a lot of time in town,
209 Still he's been around.
210 
211 In Middle-earth there is a wizard with a staff of oak.
212 His flowing beard is colored like new-fallen snow.
213 His fireworks light up the fields below,
214 And his smoke-rings glow.
215 
216 Middle-earth, beneath the Stars, below the Sun,
217 A wonder where the Norland waters run ere sunlight;
218 Elsewhere back
219 
220 In Middle-earth the wizard smokes his pipe contentedly.
221 We see the hobbits walking humming to the inn.
222 And then old Bombadil rushes in
223 From the River's edge -- to his bed.

227      The walls of the Inn begin to shimmer and become out of 
228 focus.  A chill wind creeps in under the door.  Yet the fire 
229 in  the Inn still glows brightly sheading warmth and comfort 
230 to those within.  Outside the flickering shadows of the fire 
231 though  the chill sets in and the image shifts and warps  to 
232 strange and bizare shapes.   In the far darkened corner  the 
233 draft ripples a dirty worn cloth covering a passage way into 
234 a  forgotten storrage room.  If you listen closely you might 
235 hear  the  sound  of a muffled scrape  or  occasional  sigh.  
236 Again  the draft through the loose doors and windows of  the 
237 Inn  ripple the worn curtain and then it catches a scrap  of 
238 paper  and it skitters across the floor to land in front  of 
239 the warm hearth of the Inn.

266      A  hushed  wisper  as quiet as the wind echos  ever  so 
267 slightly through the Inn as the scrap of paper lands  gently 
268 on the hearth, "Happy Valentines day."  There is a momentary 
269 pause  as  the patrons of the Inn wonder at this odd  event, 
270 but it lasts but a moment, then passing it off with a shrug, 
271 they  return to their conversations,  soon to return to  the 
272 harsh  realities  come the morning light.   Yet for now  the 
273 flickering  shadows  play  upon  the  Inns  walls,  for  the 
274 shadows of things past,  present,  and future are and always

303 Nancy, I have been reading your messages and replys with interest, tryi
305 ng to relate your problem with one of my own. As I look back now, I am sure
306 I made the wrong decision, and it cost me dearly. I might add that I am
307 male... My girl friend and I had been together for a while (about 2 months)0
308 and without going into a lot of gory details, it came the time where we
309 had to decide about the subject of sex. To make a long story short, I
310 decided that a thought for the future was more important than the 'heat
311 of the moment', if you get my drift. I didn't want to be the person
312 responsible for ruining a girl's life due to emotions. I don't know if
313 that makes much sense, it is kind of a touchy subject, because due
314 to my decision not to go forward, we are no longer an item. Should I
315 have said to hell with responsibility, and let nature take its course,
316 or what? I was so confused then, and I am not much better now. For the
317 past couple of months I have been pretty lonely. I might as well become
318 a priest. Anyway, excuse the confused tone of this message Nancy, and
319 let me know what you think of my situation.

401 (MAYBE BECAUSE I PRIDE MYSELF FOR KEEPING AN OPEN MIND... AS MUCH AS 
402 POSSIBLE) I WAS BROUGHT UP WITH REGULAR CHURCH AND SUNDAY SCHOOL, SO
403 I HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO CHOOSE, AND WHO KNOWS, I MAY CHOOSE AGAIN.
404 BUT FOR NOW I RELISH THE CHANCE TO DISCUSS RELATIVE VEIWS HERE AT THE 
405 INN.
406 
407 COULD IT BE THAT THE REASON THAT WE SEE A LOT OF CLOSE MINDED CHRISTIANS
408 IS THAT THEY ARE THE ONES ON THE CORNER OF 5TH AND MORRISON YELLING AT 
409 THE PASSERS-BY, WHILE THE REAL CHISTIANS JUST GET THE BAD REPUTATION?
411 
412 MAY NOT BELIVE IN GOD AS THE BIBLE (OR ANY OTHER REILIGOION) PUTS IT
413 BUT I LIVE (MOSTLY) BY CHRISTIAN VALUES. THIS I SEE AS THE ONLY
414 USE OF ORGANIZED RELIGION...    TO IMPOSE A SET OF RULES FOR SA SOCIETY
415 TO USE. BUT I SEE OUR CULTURE BEGINNING TO OUTGROW THIS NEED.

417                                       FORGIVE MY WANDERING

430 Evan:
431     A good point. I think that most Christians that I meet are very open
432 minded. Of course, they are mainly at church. I think they are a total
433 different crew then the people you see downtown. If you read some of the
434 messages written by "heathens"(again used in jest) on this board, you will
435 see a close minded attitude. Many of them don't even take Christianity as
436 being true into consideration. I think this close minded attitude as well
437 as training may be part of the reasons they aren't Cristians.

465 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
466 To set a few things straight:
467  
468  
469 New Wave is a social attitude towards life
470 and is not as mind rotting as some would
471 make it out to be.  The type of music is
472 not head-banging, @#%*-kicking hard
473 rock that you find on most 'stoners' radios.
474 Turn to 107 on the FM band for a taste of
475 the music.  The people
476 are no different either.
477 But still, because they dress different
478 they are described as
479 wierd, dumb, and most often at MY school 
480 GAY or HOMOSEXUAL.
481 Well theres todays society for you.
482 
483 I think you will find the peopl that say these
484 type of things to be  'dumb' jocks that wear
485 their IQ's on their jerseys.
486  
487 The typical New wWaver wears maybe a jean jacket, levi's, high top shoes or 
488 loafers, a button up sweater over a tee-shirt.
489 There are, however, Many ways to dress.
493 One more thing, What does IDIC mean?

505      It has been awhile since I last entered anything here, and thanks to
506 everyone who welcomed me back.  I've found it rather hard recently to find
507 any time for doing any serious entries at the keyboard, and a change of
508 schedule has only allowed me to be on-line at BWMS peak hours (early
509 evening) rather than my former late night time slot.  But it is good indeed
510 to be back. 
511 
512      In reference to the adventures of young love, my few comments are that
513 if you ask for another's opinion, you shouldn't be angry if that opinion
514 isn't exactly what you want to hear.  And I think that DOM is quite correct
515 in saying that if your entire support comes from someone else's pocket,
516 they have some right in determining your behavior.  I felt much the same
517 way at that age (not so long ago, though sometimes it feels otherwise), and
518 that was at a time when contraceptives were not readily available and
519 abortion was a crime.  What it comes down to is that the "right" to
520 determine what you do with your body while you are still a minor is decided
521 by those that constitute your guardians.  And, as they know you and none of
522 us do, they are much more likely to know whether you are mature enough and
523 emotionally ready for it.
524 
525      Welcome back, DOM!  I had been wondering what had happened to you.
526 I'm glad to know that you're still amoung the living, and just as dirty as
527 ever!  It's too bad you're leaving us, but I'm happy that you have the
528 opportunity to move somewhere you obviously have such a fondness for.  And
529 you're right, Portland is relatively boring, which is why I live here
530 presently.  It's slowness is exactly what I wanted when I first moved here,
531 and it helped to slow me down when I needed it the most.
532      I'm not too sure about the comment about *ALL* fathers (or parents)
533 giving more than they receive from their children, though that is true far
534 more often than not.  But there are many children that spend their (short)
535 lives as living punching bags for parents that can only qualify as
536 emotional cripples, and you can hardly say that in these cases the parents
537 gave more than they received unless what you are refering to is abuse.
538 
539      Well now!  Is that really you, Batpoop?  You're another that I've
540 wondered about.  Are you back for awhile?
541 
542      Oops!  It's late, I've many things to do, and I don't want to be
543 accused of taking up more than my fair share of room here, so I'd best be
544 off (some think I am already, but...).  See ya same bat-time, same
545 bat-channel....

550   IDIC = Infinite diversity in Infinite Combinations.
551   Spock wore it in Is There In Truth No Beauty.
552   To quote from the Official STAR TREK Catalog #2:
553   "Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations represents a Vulcan
554    belief that beauty, growth, progress--all result from the union
555    of the unlike.  Concord, as much as discord, requires the presence
556    of at least two different notes.  The brotherhood of Man is an
557    ideal based on learning to delight in our essential differences
558    as well as learning to recognize our similarities.  The IDIC is
559    a union of circle, and triangle, uniting to produce the gemstone
560    in the middle.  The circle represents infinity, nature, woman,
561    etc; the triangle can represent the finite, art, man etc."
562    Commercial as it is, the idea is good.  I see it applied in the
563    discussions here on BWMS.

588 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
589 NOT TO GET TO PHILISOPHICAL HERE OR ANYTHING.....BUT A POINT MADE EARLIER
590 IN REGARD TO CHRISTINITY APPLY TO JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. YOU SEE WE HU-
591 MANS HAVE A REAL KNACK FOR LATCHING ON TO PRECONCEIVED IDEAS, AND THAN
592 GROUPING PEOPLE INTO PRECONCEIVED GROUPS. I'LL PICK AN EXAMPLE. PEOPLE
593 SEE INDIANS AND THEY SAY....YEP, THEM INDIANS ALL HAVE TEMPERS AND CAN'T
594 HOLD THERE LICKER(slurp). OR THEY SEE A CHRISTAIN AND THEY SAY THERE
595 GOES A CLOSED MINDED SUCKER, OR ON AND ON AND ON. I FELT JUSTIFIED IN
596 CHOOSING THESE TWO, SINCE THEY APPLY TO ME, SO DON'T ANYONE GET OFFENDED!
597 THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT ABOUT 3/4'S OF THE PROBLEMS ON THIS EARTH ARE
598 CAUSED BY PEOPLE REFUSING TO LOOK AT THE VALUE OF ALL OPINIONS, AND
599 TO TREAT EACH PERSON AS AN INDIVIDUAL. ALL ARE WORTHY OF RESPECT AND
600 CONSIDERATION. I FEEL THAT FOR THE MOST PART, THE USERS OF THIS SYSTEM
601 ARE. OF COURSE, IT HELPS CONSIDERALLY THAT WE DON'T SEE EACH OTHER.
602 UNFORTUNATELY IF WE DID WE WOULD PROBABLY CLASSIFY THIS PERSON AND 
603 THAT, HERE AND THERE AND AXE THIS ONE OFF AS UNIMPORTANT, THIS ONE 
604 AS WORTHY, THIS ONE AS FOOLISH, ETC. SO TO ALL THIS I SAY LONG LIVE
605 TELECOMUNICATING!........WHEW! I DO GO ON.

607 Dear Lonely guy:
608     I think its too bad things didn't work work out for you w
609 that girl. It seems to me that two months isnt really very 
610 long and thats about how long it takes to figure out if you 
611 have enough of the same values to make it work. So maybe its
612 good that you found out that you have different values so you 
613 can find somone else who thinks more like you do.
614     I think sex is something everyone has to work out for 
615 themselves. Maybe its right that you wait until its right 
616 for you. I dont know, Im not a psychologist or anything.
