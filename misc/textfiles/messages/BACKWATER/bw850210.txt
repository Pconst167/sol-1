28          "Greetings to thee, fair Lady," said the apprentice, "I had 
29 wondered at the aura I felt approach."

34        Hmm. Eric seems to be impressed with this newcomer, Lady S.? I 
35 believe that was the name I heard. Mayhap she will be more at ease after a

38          Deryni Spell Song (words & music: Suellen Plonski)
39 When by Marluk's evil spell
40 King Brion was brought down,
41 Morgan it was sent him to hell --
42 Magic gave Brion his crown.
43 Chorus: Saint Camber, watch my bonnie Lord,
44         Deryni Magic, be his guard.
45         I say it now, it is so hard
46         to watch him 
47         To watch him off to war    (ignore above line)
48 Kelson and morgan did stand
49 Against Charissa fair;
50 Queen Jehanna did show her hand
51 In the circled magic there.
52         CHORUS
53 "Deryni," Warin made the claim,
54 "Are of the Devil born."
55 And so it was by sword or flame
56 To kill Morgan he had sworn.
57         CHORUS
58 "Healing is a gift of God," he felt,
59 "Magic to Satan is sealed."
60 His mind was changed when wound he dealt
61 By Morgan's magic it was healed.
62         CHORUS
63 Kelson, Morgan, and McLain,
64 And Bishop Ar'lan good,
65 Together they did prove the bane
66 When 'gainst Torenth's king they stood.
67         CHORUS
68 "Dearest Lord," Richenda prays,
69 "Let him come safe to me,
70 For e'en if he Bran Coris slays,
71 Dearer still's Morgan to me."
72 Final Chorus: Saint Camber, watch my bonnie Lord,
73               Deryni magic, be his guard.
74               The watchfires burn, my heart beats strong,
75               My Morgan's home from war --
76               My Morgan's home from war!
77 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
78         Resuming his seat, the bard inquired, "Tell me Lady, if I be not
79 overbold, what school of the art do you follow? For while I have not the 
80 knowledge of it that my apprentice friend has, I had thought that I knew
81 of most branches, yet this is the first I have heard of one that likes
82 not the Rowan?"

92 mention of revolver has ever crossed the phone lines... where did you
93 get such an idea... perhaps we now know why thrike has never been and

95 of america... anyway... i guess thats how the old ball bounces...

98   "If you mean where do I get my powers, the  answer is that I'm not 
99 really sure. I use the Moon for my focus, and have chosen the willow as 
100 my tree." I said, trying to remember what the corect phrases were. "But,
101  oh dear. You see, my major fault is that I hate memorizing anything I 
102 can't use immediately, and forget everything that seems wrong to my view
103  about Life. Please pretend I did't just put my teachers to shame if I 
104 have. I promise to be clearer in the future.
105  "To start again, the reason I do not like the rowan is that I am not a
106 healer, sorceror, or some other sort of mage. I am a witch, and we are 
107 the only recievers of feminine magic. The druids recieved both femine 
108 and masculine magic, the worshipers of Greek, Indian, and Hebrew gods 
109 use masculanity for thier powers. I'm afraid I must sound as if I am an 
110 advocate of female superiority, I don't believe that only women are wor-
111 th the salt for thier porridge. I just recieve my gifts from a female 
112 sorce rather than a male or a sexless one. The point of all this is that
113  the rowan is a masculine tree and it sort of annuls any hexes or anyth-
114 ing I have done or try to do."
115  After I said this, I started to be aware of the problems with letting 
116 the whole world know I was a (oh no, heaven forbid. It's a witch, let's 
117 burn 'er. She has a wart on the back her hand, the mark of the egg) 
118 witch. But since I'd just been studying witch trials I was inclined to 
119 be an itsy, bitsy bit paroniod.
120  There is a poem I'd like to show you, I don't know the orgin but it's 
121 about (this whole paragraph should be in quotes) Her."
122  I said to the man who had sung after I came in.
123  "I think you might like it, but I could be wrong. If want to see it, it
124  would be my delight to show you."

131 
132      Thank you for your kind offer...but I must refuse. My 
133 loyalty to the McKane organization is absolute. Mr McKane has
134 made me everything that I am and I will never forget the
135 debt I owe him and his great organization.
136     Besides, without the power and guidance of the Grand Dragon
137 Master I am nothing. I may as well not exist.
138     Thank you again for your kind offer.

168     The Former was sitting in one of the less lit booths, against the wall.  His eyes squinted to find more detail in the dark
169 booth.  He thought he noticed a long sword, draped ceremoniously from a thin belt.
170 
171     The young leiutenant sat uneasily, trying not too reveal how nerous this hushed conversation was making him.
172     The older leiutenant also sat, but he was easier in his manner.  His whispered speach was still strong, and even.
173     The Former listened to his spy's reports.  Reports of a citadel far off in a gray clouded land.  Where rain fell coldly on
174 dry dusty streets.  And weavers and artisans packed up their tools at the end of a day of weaving for money.
175 
176     It was a city, it's tall walls only defended it from the driving winds of the fjords.  There was no enemy, save for those
177 normally gained during the bloody intrigue of politics.
178 
179     The two members of the ceremonial guard sat euneasily, trying to hide their anticipation of what might they be told next.
180     They did this for intrigue, they reveled in the secrecy and anticipation of what would happen if they were discovered.
181     Normal reasons for betraying a political, or military trust.  For the sheer excitement.
182 
183     "No, Alteut would not betray his Fief like that.  He may be an old crotchety mage, but he has served the Satt Fief for six
184 generations.  No, whoever killed those two girls only made it look as if Alteut had done it."
185     The Former sat still, his words and accusations seemed too well formed.  Somehow his whole appearence offset this.  It was
186 a little strange to see this creature who inspired trust, a cute little thing that ambled slowly and ate leaves, speaking of a
187 cold cynical murderer.  Who sliced up young girls with magical blades.
188 
189     It scared the spies, this living realization of politics and friendly lies.  A kind furry teddy bear, animated with specal
190 life.  Hiding a smart little emotional thing, with tremendous capabilities for vengeance, and with long claws.
191 
192     The Former decided to make the journey to Fief Satt and find the actual Ripper, find the person that made the whole fief
193 scared of a kindly old mage who would never hurt anyone.

199 The mime performs
200 impossibilities--the marionette that
201 hangs
202 by
203 strings
204 is a man in a harlequin suit, a
205 flesh-and-blood puppet
206 suspended by
207 imagination
208 under the brilliant spot.
209 Limbs hang limp or purposefully move
210 at the will of the unseen 
211 puppetmaster above;
212 someone,
213 somewhere,
214 pulling strings...
215 One by one the strings are
216 let go.  
217 The marionette, bewildered, slumps
218 to the floor.  Abandoned, eyes cast
219 skyward toward the absent puppeteer,
220 the harlequin doll lies.
221 One white hand rises
222 s l o w l y
223 to grap the back of the wide crepe ruff,
224 to pull skyward, to raise the body
225 with its own strength;
226 one white hand succeeds, just
227 enough to bring the puppet to its fet--
228 triumphant smile!
229 puppet stands alone!
230 but totters,
231         tips,
232            falls,
233 without supporting strings
234 into the blue puppet-trunk. 
235 Lid snaps shut, spotlight
236 narrows to a point,
237 then widens to reveal a smiling
238 mime
239 acknowledging applause.
240 Of course, the mime, and so
241 the puppet,
242 was human all along.

264 Oh what tales he good tell of times long gone and best forgotten.
265 But still there was a time,,,,,yes a time when he could have shamed
266 the strongest and bested the most brave.
267 It was good to have so much to rely on so that the tenuous boring hours of wait 
268 would pass much quicker. To be able to recall those years of danger and inner tr
269 emblings and smile inwardly of the conquests of those fears. But who would
270 believe an old warrior, one that was
271 obviously a teller of lies and stretched
272 truths? It did not matter, no it did notmatter to him for he knew what
273 was true and what was fiction. The hell with them all, he knew what he had done
274 and he knew what he could do. Let them
275 think that he was not what he really
276 was, so much the better he thought.
277 Besides, it would mean that they would
278 not expect what was to happen in the
279 future. A short snort of a chuckle as
280 he caught himself thinking of their
281 surprised reaction awould be. Yes,
282 he said to himself, they will be quite
283 shocked, especially as the life jumped

290 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     The Young Master West     Episode IV
291 Please try to keep in mind that this is a continuation from December...
292 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     The "Alternate Reality"
293      As the Young Master West pressed his way through the milling crowd he
294 finally reached a chair at a table that seemed to be unoccupied. Upon closer
295 examination he found that he had been mistaken for this table was a good length
296 from end to end and had another patron sitting alone at the other end.
297      As the lights flickered dimmly about the Inn, sight in the darkened 
298 corners could only be described as difficult at best once the sun would hide 
299 itself behind the trees for the evening.
300      The boy walked slowly around the table to the other end where he had seen
301 the seated person.
302      "Maybe he can tell me where I can find the help I seek..." he thought.
303      As he came closer to the far end of the table, he noticed that the patron
304 was in deep thought over a small, glistening figurine that filled both of
305 his hands.
306      "Perhaps I had better wait before speaking with him," he thought. "I need
307 not rush head-long into more...  disapproval..."
308      The boy then slowed his pace to a haltand stood silently, warily, against
309 the beam that was against the wall.
310      "You are so dear to me," said the patron to the figurine. "We both know
311 that- yet... Why is it that I remain parted from you for so long?" It was the
312 saddened voice of a bold man, voice that implied wisdom.
313      This man then drew a strap of fabric from around his neck and began to
314 polish the figurine with it. He polished it until it shined almost brighter
315 then the lights about the Inn. When he was finished, he placed the object on
316 the table squarely if front of himself and returned the fabric to around his
317 his neck.
318      The Young Master West could almost make out the figurine to be some type
319 of a horse while the man's hushed voice did not carry far enough to be heard.
320      "I am so sorry, Peg." were his words.
321      The Young Master West took his first step forward to ask the man his
322 question.
323 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
324 It isn't much, but I'm still proud of my work...
325 Piper: I hope I have treated you with appropriate chivalry. There is more
326 to follow if this has met with your approval.

329 
330 tis I tis I tis I tis I tis I tis I tis I tis I tis I tis I tis I tis I tis I
331    "I would hope that your exodus has not caused you any great distress. 
332 Though I regret to inform you that your colleagues have not yet expended too
333 great an energy to regain your person."
334    Fortunarely, the lights within the room were dim or else Gaudy would not
335 have tried to sit up. Whatever it was that she had been drinking left a
336 terrible aftertaste, not to mention a splitting headache.
337    "You know, there are several other ways of getting a lady's attention...
338 Did you ever consider sticking a gun in my back? Or even just ASKING me to 
339 leave?" she said as she clutched her head from the pain.
340    "Your tone, though in jest, is still as sibilant. No, the mastery with which
341 you have been enlighted would have proven the former to be a grievous error. On
342 the other hand, the latter would only have served to increase you interests."
343    That entertaining feeling that she had before she had passed out was long
344 gone. She couldn't tell which made her feel all the more irritated- the hang-
345 over that she didn't have the pleasure of earning, or the way this fellow
346 insisted on speaking like he came right out of the late middle ages.
347    "Ooooo! Such big words! You would think that they were a chore... Then 
348 again, you play the dandy just about as well as you play the fool."
349    "Not precisely a civil tounge..."
350    "I  NEVER  play by the enemies rules!" said Gaudy with a bit of a snap.
351    "Nor, does it seem, by the rules of the protector of your own...
352 flock, as it were. Surely you must know tha all I require from you is little
353 conversation to pass the time until your companions arrive for your departur."
354    "A conversation? Or do you want me to 'spill my guts'? You don't get the 
355 picture, do you? (pun, sorry) You don't know what you're up against, do you?
356 I don't think you do."
357    "Oh, certainly. I have full knowledge of just what a task I have undertaken
358 to have brought YOU here. Of all people they chose to replace me with, YOU!"
359 Conpempt could easily be heard in the words spoken.
360    "What ARE you babbeling about? Replace who? Wait a second...   ..."
361 This shadow of a person stood from the table that it used to rest its weight
362 and began to move restlesly about the darkened room. It was obviously nervous
363 but did little to hide the fact.
364    "If it is really you, why have you done this?" she said in a quieter, more
365 relaxed tone of voice. "Why did you have to abduct me to get attention? There
366 could have been other, less drastic measures for you to have taken. The 
367 different possibilities are endless..."
368    "BECAUSE, You are the reason why I am not any longer a thriving entity 
369 within the organization! You... you... you..." Its voice trailed of as if at
370 a loss for words to finish what was to be said.
371    Gaudy gave the slightest sigh and began to contemplate how she would use
372 this sign of weakness from it. #Now is my chance to overpower (him). But 
373 should I leave? There is so much more I could learn if I remained. Ian, you
374 never did make such decisions available during training, darn you!#
375    The two remained motionless for a long time before the next word was spoken.
376 tis I tis I tis I             ...Mystery Author...   (yes, tis I) tis I tis I

378 L'homme sans Parity- Could you by chance relay the events that have occuered
379    to the lady in question, a Guardy Minsky?  Has she readily the opportunity
380    to receive this directly? I have assumed, although probably incorrectly,
381    that she has little time to spare for the BackWaters compared to days past.

385 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ETC.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
386   Tonight I had a feeling that pulled at my memories.  A feeling I have not 
387 had in a long, long, time.
388   
389   When I was very small I saw a picture, where I am not sure but the picture
390 stands in my mind.  The caption read:
391         "Do you see the faces or the vase?"
392   The picture was two dark silhouettes facing inward, it was also a white vase
393 against a black background.  A simple picture, but like so may simple things,
394 it was a symbol with many meanings.
395   I have always tried to look deeper than those around me.  There are times I
396 feel I see things that others cannot.  
397   I have tried to appreciate the gaps in living, the pauses in our lives.  I 
398 have tried to fill them with wonder..... and anticipation.
399   
400   As children we played on swings.  We felt the wind in our hair, a firm hand
401 on our backs.  We pumped our legs to go higher and higher.  Our feet leaving
402 twin trails on the ground when we dragged them, wiping out the small divots
403 where we stood on tip-toes to start.
404   But my favorite feeling was in the instant, much to brief to cature, when
405 nothing moved.  Frozen in mid-air as if by a camera flash, moving neither 
406 forward nor back.  But in that instant there was a thrill, a feeling in my 
407 stomach that tingled, oh so briefly.
408 
409   Anticiation.....
410 
411   I felt that tonight.  In the touch of a hand, a cautious kiss, it lasted 
412 for hours.
413 
414   A sweet taste of childhood on the lips of a new lover.

419 Sondargaard, the Guardian -- Pray, please continue!  Do you want interaction,
420 or do you have the full plot of this episode fully worked out?  --p
421 pppppppppppppppppp
422    Having finished his medley of tunes long since, the piper stood up as
423 a newcomer made her way into the inn.  Bowing low to the lady as soon
424 as she finished her speech to the apprentice, he spoke:
425   "Lady, as a Celt, let me please assure you that the Rowan -- for our folk--
426 has no masculine-only connotations.  The rowan by the entrance here was planted
427 by the lady Pam -- whose relationship to the tree came from her Irish
428 forbearers.  For our people it is a symbol of stability, and a warding against
429 evil.  Although I am not deeply conversant in these matters, I have found that
430 many of the magical symbolisms have been formed by cultural prejudice.
431   Perhaps the magical school you have been trained in dates from some far
432 distant period in history when the founders of your school strove against
433 my ancestors?  This could, indeed, explain the disparity with which we
434 view the tree.
435 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
436     Disparity?  Great, just great there L'homme.

439 Piper:  I hate to say "hands off" since it is your character, so I won't. What
440      I have planned for the upcoming confrontation is a little difficult to ex-
441      plain. After I have set the course back to its proper stream, I might just
442      return to the Inn to thank you for the words you have (will) given me.
443      (Not to mention dragging along my boasterous older brother, remember him?)
444      As I have said, I write these West entries down before entering them and
445      get easily confused when a conflict arises to scrap my forethought.
446         I would be honored to join words with you in a tale shortly. (Shortly
447      should be all the time I need to finish this next episode.)

455  "I'm not sure why the rowan blocks my powers, but since it does, I suppose that it might be because it WAS used so widely by 
456 the Druids and other pre-saxon Kelts. You see, witches started in Germany and France; so when the saxons invaded they most 
457 likely brought some witches with them. It would make sense that the witches and Druids battled, so perhaps the trees which both 458 had used achived different powers to the different spell casters. The witches' powers percieved the rowan as masculine since we 459 put everything into masculine, feminine, or sexless types; and the druids, who reviered all trees, percieved the rowan as simply460 very powerful (which it is).
461   "I'm sorry if I have said anything which is not true, history is not my forte, and please correct me if so."

474 thus showing that nothing is in the dark that is not in the light...

488    "I'm not really to sure about all this. Are you sure this is going to work?
489 I mean, with all those others around it won't be like the practice session."
490    "Don't worry," confided Tina. "All you have to do is just pay attention to
491 what I'm telling you with the hand gestures and to keep an eye on the 
492 indicator every once in awhile to be certain of what is really going on around
493 you. Here, take some of these," she said as she withdrew a small package of
494 tablets from her handbag.
495    "Hmmm?  What are those? Are you sure it's o.k. to take that many?" asked
496 Jack in a concerned manner.
497    "Oh, sure. I take 'em all the time before I go in There! They're just some
498 antacids. I think you may need them once you get down in the pit. It can be a
499 
500 real hell down there," said Tina as if in passing.
501    "Thanks! Thanks a bunch! You know this isn't going to be easy, so why tell
502 me that it's going to get worse? Give me a break..."
503    "Come on, don't worry. You're intelligent, you can handel it. I know, or I
504 wouldn't have brought you along, she said trying to make him feel at rest. She
505 could recall what it was like the first time she stepped into the pit, but
506 tryed not to let it show. It was a nightmare that he was about to enter.
507    "Th... Thanks, I guess i'm just a little uptight because I don't know
508 what I'm getting into. Thanks for the vote of confidence." said Jack as he
509 straitened his jacket and tie. "Let's go. We have some points to re-write
510 in Economic History."
511    "I'm right behind you, Jack." 
512    "Oh, and Tina?" 
513    "Yes, Jack..."
514    "Thanks for all the help, I don't know what I'd do without you."
515    "No problem, charming. Let's get going, the Market awaits."
516 And the Market will never be the same...

598 Dawn greeted me as I watched it rise over the plain.
599 Inwardly, I breathed a little sigh.  I had earned this vacation.  Healing, as
600 I had found out, was no easy task.  I hoped that I would never have to go 
601 through such an ordeal again.  Those who Healed gained a new respect from me.
602 Although time had passed by pleasantly during the last two months, something
603 intangible tugged at a small corner of my mind.  Small disturbances in the
604 fabric of reality caused ripples that spread out across the vast distances
605 (and other not-so-easily-definable boundries), finally to work their way into
606 my mind.  Although I enjoyed the rest, I was beckoned.
607 #By what?#, I thought.  One image repeated itself in the chain of thought I
608 forged from that question: that of the Inn, and the people who spent their
609 time there.
610 I arose, and began to walk down the stair into the tower.  Step after step,
611 I thought on how much I enjoyed conversing with the patrons (#...innklings,
612  call them innklings#, went the thought that I caught floating by).
613 The decision came quickly.  I reached the end of the stair then turned right,
614 passing five doors before entering the sixth.  The room was furnished in a
615 sparse manner, barely having the common table, chair, and bed found in most
616 dwellings.  I opened the chest at the end of the rickety bed.
617 Clothes flew about my head as I tossed them out one by one, in search of a
618 particular item.  At last, near the bottom, was the tome that I had been 
619 looking for.
620 It was marked with peculiar runes on the outside, and closed with a strange
621 lock that was not unlike the sort of thing you find on diaries.  With an odd
622 twist of my hand and a low word, the book opened.
623 Yes!  It was the Travelling Book, after all.  Tomes such as this were extremely
624 rare, and I counted myself lucky to have one at all.  I checked carefully to
625 see that it was well stocked with letters, material components, and vellum-
626 no telling what need may befall me.  That done, I returned to the Tower Summit.
