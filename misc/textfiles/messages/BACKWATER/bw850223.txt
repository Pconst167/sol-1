31                              Episode IV   Scene I
32    Walking along the beach, my heels digging into the fine black
33 sand, I contemplated the sunset.  A hugh red disk sinking into the
34 horizon just were the beach and ocean meet.  Waves silhouetted
35 against its glow.  I would gaze at the waves against the sun for a
36 moment and have to look away, the afterimages purple and green
37 blotting out my eyesight for minutes afterward.
38    Safe.  The feeling was almost alien.  After many months of
39 constant vigilance this tiny haven of security was like a dream
40 world.  The waves in the sun and the patterns they burned into the 
41 eyes only added to the surrealistic atmosphere.
42    Taspoli was a small village perched on the edge of a small inlet
43 on the northern side of The Island.  The cliffs surrounding the inlet
44 protected it from wind and weather as well as humans.  The most
45 beautiful place I have been is standing on it's beach at sunset.
46 An hour before the blazing ball was due to sink for yet another day I
47 would walk along the north beach to a place where the sun's orb was
48 aligned with the edge of the sand and water, framed between the high
49 cliffs, then I would stare at the spectacular view until the last arc
50 of flame had been swallowed by the sea.
51  My time of rest and meditition would soon be coming to a close.
52 There were things to be done in the rest of the world and
53 tempting as Taspoli was, I could not stay here long.  Boredom is
54 a mighty and terrible force.

95 ever since mckane started out this pornography thing... it is ever so... um...
96   hawkwind... no offense is taken... in fact... a nice kindred feeling... do you
97 know the feeling... if not... meyhaps you ought to now...

103 Great news kathyd, to hear you kicked the habit. I know how hard it is to break
104 such a driving force that habits can be beings that I am an expolice officer
105 and (of course) a low profile type of individual. I've seen lives ruined and 
106 in shambles because of urges and addictions that shook the very foundations of
107 peoples souls. So it is with great glee to hear that a great person like 
108 yourself was able to do it on her own, without help from the Schick Center or
109 Serenity Lane. Good for you kathyd and I hope those black and white orbs never
110 darken your life again. It's time to move on to bigger and better things in 
111 life. It's time to smell the roses and go out into the real world and really
112 see life as it can be. With your habit licked(excuse the pun) I hope that you 
113 will be able to find something better to replace those sometimes uncontrolable
114 urges. Might I suggest chocolate covered marshmellow filled Pinwheels?
115 Your Ever Admiring THOR

118 It seems that I have missed part of a disk.  Words disappear, like rain upon
119 water.
120 Sage
121   Thank you for your concern.  It has been some time sence I have written here.
122 My last entry was during a rather difficult time, but it is times like that I
123 feel the need to write the most.  I have still not seen the face in the shadows
124 even though the dream is still with me.
125 Prometheus, Tanya, Michael
126   Except for here, Adrian is dead.  She bids you a fond farewell, but elsewhere
127 her voice has been silenced.  The dream fortold it.  I am no longer allowed to 
128 visit elsewhere.               
129                      In the darkness
130                      There is laughter
131                                                                  Adrian

134    The piper was sitting at a back table, nursing a still-full glass of ale
135 when a dark figure slid into the inn.  Slipping unnoticed through the crowd,
136 the figure left a dark-bordered slip of paper on the piper's table.  Noticing
137 movement from the corner of his eye, the piper looked up just in time to see
138 the figure disappearing into the crowd.
139   The piper picked up the paper curiously, then felt himslef racked with
140 grief as the meaning written down there penetrated his being.  Slipping out
141 the scarred door, he walked toward the forest -- seeking solace in the
142 silence.  Here, he knew, was healing.  Here was the only place that the
143 forces of life and decay played out their eternal game in a manner that 
144 spoke directly to his wounded soul.
145   It is one thing to realize that death is the inevitable end of each of
146 us -- and another to emotionally realize it.  The loss of a friend is
147 hard to take, and the recovery from the loss may take a while.
148  ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
149         Agents. Agents everywhere. Some kind of convention perhaps? No... Just another day in the life of a NET agent;
150 always alone, yet always accompanied by his peers.
151         L'homme and Farley where at the top of a ladder leaning leaning against the side of the house on 54th in SE 
152 Portland. They were practicing their Swedish accents while posing as house painters. Fellows was steadying the ladder
153 from below. Good thing Fellows was there, because the ladder nearly fell when the curtain covering the window suddenly
154 flew up, and a figure peered out from the room beyond the window. But the figure didn't seem to think much of the painters
155 outside, looking past them instead of at them. But the figure was not alone!
156         Gaudy Minsky. It had to be! She was in the room with the as yet unnamed figure. Although a photographer might have
157 complained about the light, there was enough for L'homme to see that Gaudy was not in the best of conditions. L'homme
158 smiled, but for just a second. #It's not as bad as it could have been...# L'homme turned to Farley, and said in NET combat
159 code, which sounds remarkably like Swedish, to get ready for action. "Fellows. Go around to the front and take care of
160 the heat in the living room. Fellows nodded and set forth on his task. "Ready Farley?" "Ready!" NET's newest agent said.
161 "I feel I could take on the entire world!" "I know what you mean.", L'homme replied. "1..2..3..Jump!"
162         Windows certainly aren't made the way they used to be made. They are made better. The cuts and bruises would heal,
163 eventually. No time to think about such things now. L'homme and Farley had decided to take the initiative. Surprise was on
164 their side also. Who would expect two Swedish house painters to jump from a ladder, through a window 12 feet above the
165 ground, and tackle anyone unlucky enough to be standing near by. The struggle was brief; L'homme stood next to the now
166 broken window, super gun drawn and covering the mysterious man. Farley was standing next to Gaudy, Betsy at the ready.
167 L'homme couldn't help himself. "I'm L'homme sans Parity. I'm here to rescue you!" Gaudy took the cue, and even though her
168 head still pounded, continued, "Aren't you a little short for a NET agent?" L'homme laughed, and said, "Gaudy, they
169 couldn't have hurt you too much. You saw through my disguise again, AND you remembered the lines to the movie!" "Well 
170 Parity, I have been...."
171         A single report interrupted the mini-reunion. "That must be Fellows taking care of the downstairs welcoming
172 committee." Moments later, Fellows opened the door, stepped inside, and closed the door behind him. "All done boss. NET
173 1, Black Hats zip."
174         "You haven't changed a bit. Still the same lack of morality. Supermen with guns." It was the black dressed man,
175 speaking for the first time, The surprise of the preceding events obviously long gone. L'homme replied with a high
176 degree of contempt in his voice. "That will be about enough out of you. Do you want your last words on this earth to be
177 so vindictive? You were hurting our fellow agent, and our friend. We don't take kindly to such actions." Fellows and
178 Farley tensed. They had both seen this look in L'homme's eyes before. They knew what was about to happen. NET agent Parity
179 raised his gun, and carefully aimed it at the would be captor of Gaudy Minsky.
180         "No! No! Don't kill him!" It was Gaudy jumping as best she could to her feet. "You don't know all the
181 facts. Pleeaase!" L'homme glanced at Gaudy, his gun hand wavering a bit, but the trigger finger tightened. The man in 
182 black spoke again. "You really don't remember me, do you Esteves?" #Esteves! He knows my true first name! But how?#
183 L'homme lowered his gun, and for the first time in a long time said, "I think I may have made a mistake..."

189     "A moment, please. I ought to adjust my wrappings, an odd form of clothing,
190 I know. It does however serve the purpose, and can be applied elsewhere." The
191 Sage sighed.  Delighted in the knowledge of his new found companion.  It was
192 this knowledge that allowed for the Sage to know what questions he was going to
193 ask, and why.  It was nice to answer questions nicely.
194     "I see you wear white, may I be so bold as to inquire why you wear the most
195 easily stained color in the universe?"  Inquired the still cloaked figure at
196 ease next to the Sage.  The odd one tipped his tankart to taste the last drops.
197     "It is neat. All in all it is a nifty color to wear, and if I am willing to
198 clean it occasionally, it isn' so bad as One might expect."  Said the Sage, who
199 was smiling a quite inimatible smile of content.  Delightment in the diversity
200 of two friends.  The Sage continued, seeing that the Odd One was not in any
201 rush to pose another question.  "Oh, yes, I ought to mention; Because they are
202 loose white strips of cloth, they cn be detatched and attatched easily. A very
203 adaptive set of clothing, don't you think?"
204 
205     "I do, but still they are rather bold.  Ach, I should not talk so freely,
206 after all, I sit before you in a fine set of chain that any man might spot at
207 the width of the Drieges river near here.  Forgive my unwarranted outburst, may
208 I ask?"  the Odd One was tryintg to be charming, and was now succeeding.
209     "Forgiven, friend. Might I ask your name? We have sat and talked for over
210 four days, departing only to sleep, and still I do not know your name!"  Said
211 the Sage, appearing whimsically as possible, to lighten any dampened spirits.
212     "My name is, it is, ah, it is One if you must know. I did not choose it for
213 me, and I knew nothing of the relevance until recently when I discovered this
214 Inn, and the patrons therin."  Said the Odd One, uneasily tapping at the table
215 top.  Playing with tapping at the grain of the oaks.
216 
217     "Why do you not change it then? Many do, it is nothing of shame. So why did
218 you not assume another title?"
219     "I like this one. Please excuse the pun, it is often made."
220     "If you like it, then why do you hide it so well? It must be difficult to."
221 
222     "Because of teasing, it is well hidden. Only when I am sure that I will not
223 be teased do I give t away. And I do not easily feel sure of safety. Forgive me
224 again please? For not trusting you implicitly, of course."  Meakly worded the
225 Odd One.
226     "No offense taken, and I do understand. Forgive me also, we have both been
227 negligent in assuming things this day."  Said the Sage, pleased in sounding so
228 'Nifty' to his friend.  I ought to be impressing this 'Odd One', thought Sage.
229     "Shall we go then? Not an especially nice day for it, what with overcast
230 skies and such. It ought to be a nice brisk walk of some hours or so."  Said
231 the Odd One, knowing more than he ought to know.
232     "And might I presume how you knew where our destination was?"  Asked Sage.
233     "During a conversation about your being late all the time, you mentioned it
234 briefly to me."  Explained the Odd One, sounding trustworthy beyond measure.
235 
236     "Alright then, prepare yourself for a four hour walk of pleasant demeanor.
237 It is actually a nice walk, I appreciate it more since the ant problem a while
238 ago. Care to hear some of the details of it? It was interesting, demented and
239 sad, but interesting."  Mused the Sage, delighting again, this time in the easy
240 and simple way that this Odd One made him think.
241 
242     And so the Sage and the One left the Inn, and started a walk through a damp
243 and slightly darkened forest.

249                        (a true story)
250 The night was long, the computer slow but all things concidered the jobs
251 finished and the paperwork was completed. Kathy lay her head down on the
252 desk and closed her eyes. The newsman would be at the front door to fill
253 the paper rack in about 15 minutes, so just a chance to relax before the
254 3 flights of stairs must be decended and accended. Kathy thought to herself
255 #no don't do it, you will fall asleep faster than you can say DTR# so she
256 dragged herself from the chair and went out to the terminal room. Logging
257 into her favorite inn she read with interrest the messages left by travelers.
258 after finishing her buisness at the inn, she called a few more numbers to
259 receive the customary busy signals. Reseting the terminal she rose to go 
260 and get her daily intake of human problems(newspaper).
261    The news was uneventfull and she absentmindently forgot to read her 
262 horror scope.(mistake number one).  8:00 am rolled around and her leadperson
263 came in to relieve her. following her leadperson was her manager with
264 her bi yearly performance review under his arm. Kathy grabbed a pen and
265 sat down ready to sign and get out the door. The review was excellent the
266 raise was acceptable, signing and leaving the department after telling her
267 newest joke, Kathy headed out the door.
268    She jumped into her overly beaten V.W. and headed at Mach 8 home, she
269 was late picking up Meme because of the unexpected review. At home she
270 cleaned out the car in less that 60 second and grabbed her ski equiptment.
271 checking for her cash, drivers license and visa card she jumped in a raced
272 over to Meme's. Putting on her Vuarnet's with a big finger print in the
273 center of the right lense she hurtled to the apartment where Meme lived.
274 Bringing her car to a stop she saw Meme comming out the door with her
275 stuff and they were loaded up and off faster than you can say *pokeacabinboy*
276 The two hours up to the mountain went quickly as Kathy and Meme caught up
277 on the good gossip currently circulating Tektronix dp departments.
278 The next thing the two knew was they were at the mountain ready to ski and
279 the sun was shining bright. Kathy skied nonstop for about 6 hours, Meme
280 took a couple of breaks for beers and boywatching. At the end of the
281 day Kathy was beat and Meme was still feeling very good. It was decided
282 that Meme drive home(mistake number two). Kathy was groaning with fatigue
283 and her legs were shaking as they took off down the mountain. Kathy
284 almost has her eyes closed when the car took a little jump, looking back
285 Kathy say the cause, a large pointed rock about the size of a adult skull
286 was spinning in the road. Kathy thought #no, im not even going to think
287 about a flat tire, not even going to think about a flat tire, not even#
288 HISSSS, CLUNK, CLUNK, CLUNK, "Meme, pulled over, weve got a flat" Meme 
289 nodded and pulled the car to the side of the road. Kathy got out and looked
290 'sure enough the left front tire was flat as a road kill named frisbee.
291 "meme" get the release for the trunk in the glove compartment." Meme flipped
292 the latch and Kathy tried the truck, "gee what's wrong with this thing?"
293 "it won't open" after giving it the college try for a minute, a police
294 man drove by , seeing the two young girls in trouble he pulled up behind'
295 
296 them and turned his lights on. "what seems to the trouble girls" the friend
297 ly cop enquired. Kathy replied, despair in her voice" I can't get my spare
298 tire , the trunk won't open" The police officer smiled and put on his best
299 macho look. "that's ok girls let me at it" Kathy went to the car and flipped
300 the trunk release and the policeman tried . After a few minutes the police
301 man went to his car and returned with a screwdriver. pushing it up under
302 the hood her mangled the hood for 20 minutes without the trunk opening.
303 "ah girls, ive tried my best, ill look for a tow for you" he jumped into 
304 his car and was gone. All Kathy could see was dollar bills with wings 
305 flying out of her pocket at the thought of a tow into portland,
306    And so Kathy started to think creatively, while Meme said "Well at
307 least it isn't raining"  Kathy turned to agree with Meme as she felt a
308 drop of water hit her nose. Smiling she said "Meme, we need a tire, let's
309 flag down the next V.W." and so the girls turned on the charm and within
310 a few minutes, Ma and Pa kettle in their sky blye bug pulled over, Kathy
311 rushed to the car as Ma kettle rolled downt he window and enquired what
312 the trouble was.
313 Kathy:  Ill give you my drivers license, my credit cards, the rights to
314         my first born child, if you let us use your spare tire.
315 Ma Kettle: hold on dearie don't you have a spare?
316 Kathy:  I can't get my truck open, and my spare is in the truck with
317         the jack.
318 at this the older couple agreed to help. Of course Pa kettle put his
319 share of dents into the hood trying to open it. at last a tire was
320 being offered by the older couple. Just as the car was up on a jack
321 and the tire was being replaced, the cop and the tow pulled up. the
322 towtruck driver stepped out with a pair of LARGE tin snips and said,
323 "Ill get that hood open for you little lasy" Kathy nearly fainted at
324 the sight of the giant scissors and the tow truck man smile and
325 him and the policeman left.  
326    And so the story ends that ma and pa kettle followed Kathy and Meme
327 into portland, left the car up on block and took their spare home.
328 Kathy got the address of the kind couple with a promise to send them
329 a chistmas card every year. Meme's boyfriend came and got her and
330 Kathy took the dead tire up to the service station in the Benz. The
331 tire was a total. At this point Kathy was ready to fall over with
332 fatigue. #what's that i heard about sleepy eyed women?# she drove
333 slowly home and past the wounded car. she was asleep within 15 
334 minutes of her arival home.
335            L U C K Y   S A T U R D A Y ?
336 Kathy awoke, and dressed. Her little car was where she had left it
337 the night before, up on blocks, #so it wasn't just a funny dream?#
338 She went to the front of the car and pressed the little knob, heard
339 a click and the hood opened. She sat down in front of the car and
340 began to laugh.

348 I watch as she stumbles, a small cry of pain escapes her lips.
349 Reaching out to help her, she screams back at me to leave her 
350 alone. Grasping at the crude sticks she has employed as crutches,
351 she once again struggles to her feet. Moving slowly forward, she
352 takes a cautious step forward again. First one, then another.
353 Then a small pebble turns her foot, twisting her ankle. As she
354 falls, I rush forward to catch her. Again as I touch her she 
355 screams her anger and frustration at me. It hurts and I want to
356 help. It is frustrating to have to stand and watch my friend 
357 struggle this way. I want to help, for her success is mine. 
358 I want to reach out to her, I want to provide the steadying 
359 support she crys out for. If not physical then at least moral, 
360 as she provides me. For in truth I need that support as much as 
361 she. For I have not the strength to stand on my own.

382 Love is like an old hat, up in the closet. You put it on, but hey, it doesn't
383 fit. Wait a minute! This isn't my hat! This must be the hat of the man who
384 came to see my wife! But I'm not married. What is going on here?! Oh, wait.
385 There, now it fits.
386 
387 Now matter if they live in mud huts or igloos or glass shacks, people all over
388 thw world want the same thing: A new house.
389 
390 When you die, if you go somewhere where they ask you a bunch of questions about
391 your life and what you learned about and all, I think a good way to get out of
392 it is just to say, "No speaka English."
393 
394 I wish I could go back in time to Pompeii, so I could warn everyone about the
395 telephone.

397 I bet when they weren't fighting, Vikings with helpmets had to stick potatoes
398 on the ends of the horns, so as to avoid eye pokings to fellow Vikings and
399 lady Vikings.

403      IN EVERY PERSON THERE ARE FOUR ROOMS. THE FIRST IS THE LIVING ROOM
404 WHICH IS OPEN TO ALL AND ALL SEE. THE SECOND IS THE DINING ROOM IN WHICH
405 FEW ARE INVITED TO DINNER. THE THIRD IS THE BEDROOM, FEW SEE IT AND
406 INSIDE ARE AIRY AND LACY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS. THEN THERE IS THE BASEMENT>
407 THIS ROOM IS FILLED WITH A PERSONS DARKEST SECREETS.
408 THERE ARE THOUGHTS HERE THAT SCARCELY AND RARLY REACH THE SUB-SURFACE
409 OF CONCIOUSNESS, THE HIDDEN DESIRES AND HATES.
410      TAKING THE CANDLE OF MY CONSCIOUS THOUGHT, I WENT TOwARD THE FOURTH D_O
411 DOOR. THM STAIRS MADE OF ROTTEN THOUGHTS SAGGED UNDER ME; I CAME UPON A
412 LARGE AND RUSTY DOOR. COVE@ED WITH LOCKS. THIS WAS THE DOOR
413 THAT NOT ONLY BARS MY FEAR BUT ALSO ]MY  DREAMS AND
414 INNOCENCE. 
415  NNOCEBNCE. 
416      WHEN I FINALY ENTERED THE ROOM I FOUND MORE THAN A LITTLE DUST FROM
417 DISUSE AND THE PLACE WAS THICK  WITH COBWEBS. THIS WAS THE DUST
418 OF PAST THOUGHTS AND IDEAS THAT WERE NEVER USED. THE DIM LIGHT OF MY
419 CONSCIOUSNESS FLICKERED ON THE WALLS AND A SHIVER OF FEAR RAN THROUGH ME.
420 ALONG THE WALLS AND SCATTARED ACROSS THE FLOOR WERE STRANGE YET FAMILIAR
421 TROPHIES GOF FORGOTTEN AND PETTY TRIUMPHS>
422      ACROSS THE ROOM WAS A SOOTY FIREPLACE, AND IN IT BURNED THE
423 INFERNAL FIRES OF HATE. WHAT C_UGHT MY ATTENTI_N THOUGH WAS A MIRROR WHICH HUNG
424 OVER  THE HARTH ACROSS THE ROOM FROM ME. THE MIRR_R OR ITSELF HAD A SILVERY LOOK
425 AND NOT A SPECK OF DUST TOUCHED IT; EVERY THING ELSE WAS THICK WITH GRIT AND 
426 GRIME. I SLOWLY WALKED IT WIT@H THE WSTRANGE SENCE OF ANTICAPTION.
427 LITTLE CLOUDS OF PAST THOUGHT WERE CREATED WITH EACH FOOT FALL.
428 MY CANDLE FLICKERED A MILLION TIMES IN T THE INFKINATE DiSTANCES OF THE MIRROR.
429 IN THE MIRROR, FAR AWAY APPERED A SEA OF TEARS PHAT I HAD CAUSED. THE RAINBOWS O
430 OFF TINY DEAMONS THAP WERE FLERTING`AT AT THE
431 EDGE OF MY PERCEPTION AND MY HEARD BEAT FASTER.  THEN I NOTICED MY REFLECTION IN
432 MIRROR AND MY HORROR GREW. FOR IN THE MIRROR WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS
433 BUT WHAT I AM. THE MOSTER I BEHELD  WAS ALL THAT I DESPISED. THE HUNGRY LOOK OF
434 SELFISHNESS DROOLED DOWN HIS FACE. THE MALACE OF A THOUSAND DIFFERENT
435 KINDS OF PREJUDICES APPEARED IN HIS EYES. THAN A GOOD AND KINDDY IMAGE
436 APPERED AND MERGAD WITH THE MONSTER, TOGETHER T@EY BLENDED AND FORMED ME.
437 THEN FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE MIRROR FLEW A DEMON THAT FILLED THE MIRROR WITH
438 IT'S PRESENCE AND DEVOURED THE REFLECTION. IT WAS A SIMPLE THOUGHT, COLD AND
439 STERILE. THE THOUGHT ITSELF WAS NOT EVIL IN THE NORMAL SENSE, BUT IN T IT'S
440 TRUTH IT GNAWED AT THE CENTER OF MY BEING AND IN MY MHEART I FELT DISMAY.
441 ITS HIDEOUS GRIN SHOWED NEEDLE-SHARP TEETH. I COULD NOT MOVE AND IN VAIN I
442 ATTEMTED TO  REFUTE IT. ALL MY SENSES HIGHTENED IN TERROR. THE DEAMON ONLY
443 GRINNED FURTHER AND IT'S EYES GLINTED WITH PURE DELIGHT. IT WAS THEN
444 ,IN SHEER COLD TERROR; A COLD`SWEAT TRICKLED DOWN MY BACK. MY CANDLE FLICKERED
445 AND GREW DIM; IT'S LIGHT SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED BY THE DEAMON. I RAN FOR THE DOOR
446 TRIPPED AND FELL. THE DEMON FLOWED OUT OF THE MIRROR AND SANK IT'S TALLONS.
447 INTO MY FLESH. I WRENCHED MYSELF FREE AND SCRAMBLED FOR THE DOOR. I SHUT THE
448 DOOR AND BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF; THEN A STRONG THRUST AGAINST THE DOOR
449 OPENED IT A CRACK. I COUGHT A GLIMPSE OF`THE DEMON,. ITS EYES AL WELL AS ITS
450 LAUGH MOCKED ME. WITH THE STRENGTH BORN OF FEAR I CLOSED THE DOOR AND QUICKLY
451 L_CKED ALL THE LOCKS. THE DEAMON BATTERED THE DOOR FRUITLESSLY.
452 MY VICTORY WAS A SMALL ONE, THOUGH, FOR IT'S STILL THERE. SOMETIMES I CAN HERE
453 IT POUNDING, wAITING FOR MY GUARD TO L_GOWER SO THAT IT CAN ESCAPE TO TORMENT ME
454 ONCE AGAIN. STILL I FEAR THE TH_UGHT THAT I DARE NOT THINK.

470 (excuse the mispelled GREAT) episode for a TV sitcom. Think I'll notify the
471 three major concerns. And beings the story was a TRUE one means only that beside
472 being a writer you are also a skiier. Is there nothing that you can not succeed
473 in? I am more and more amazed each time I find myself here at the Inn.(Correct
474 Nomenclature?) and now that you have "kicked the habit" it is obvious that you
475 are on to bigger and better things. The writing is only an example of what you
476 have inside yourself. Aren't you glad that what you have inside yourself is not

496 L'homme: Allow me, thy source of confusion, the time to don yon hip boots and

498   #My dear Kosta, what has thou gotten thyself into this time?...#
499  OSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA
500    "Esteves!... Esteves!... Esteves," spoke the dark figure in confident, smooth, and commanding tones.
501 "You really don't remember me, do you? Do you? Really don't remember me? Esteves... Don't remember me..."
502 Yes, the tones were commanding and they seemed to be having an effect on L'homme in a way that didn't make
503 Farley look to comprehensive of the matter, nor Fellows to pleased. 
504    "Alright Mister, enough monkey business, you can just knock it off." And with that, Fellows sent a couple 
505 of rounds into an empty corner of the darkened room just to make sure his point was being taken seriously.
506 The rounds seemed to have done the job for L'homme staggered back a step, blinked, and wavered his weapon
507 back in the direction of the dark figure.
508 "Don't move, I've got you covered!" was the first thing that came to L'homme's mind. Then it all came back 
509 to him. He realized that he had just been the subject of hypnotic speach, something he had prided hiself
510 for being able to recognize and ignore while in official training. Not so any longer.
511 Gaudy took another slow, and somewhat painful step to try to come between both L'homme and the dark figure.
512    "Don't kill him! You still don't understand, he's one of us!" said Gaudy in such a way as to totally
513 confuse both Fellows and Farley. "Just don't kill him..."
514    "L'homme, do you mind telling the rest of us just precisely what the heck is going on here? I mean
515 even though you get carried away at times, I'd still like to know the facts. We ARE the good guys, aren't 
516 we?" asked Farley in a confused, yet demanding voice.
517    "Hold on Farley. Gaudy, are you trying to tell me that this guy is NET personnel?"
518    "Nevermore!" said the dark figure.
519    "Yes. I mean, that was before my time. You do remember when I came in, don't you?" stammered Guady.
520    "Yes, but that was because Coolidge didn't... he didn't come back..." Recolection could
521 be seen on L'hommes face. Back to the time of Bulgaria, back to the time in Nepal, back to the time in
522 Croydon. Memories flooded him, both of the good times and the bad.
523    "Coolidge? 'Back to Square One'?" said L'homme in a humbled voice.
524    "Yea, 'Send thee to Square One.' You recall well more than the passing lines from movies. We hadn't
525 used that Key Phrase in over five years. Yet how shall one attempt to ignore time spent in Nepal?" asked the dark one.
526    "Coolidge, You're back!" he said as he lowered his gun-like weapon. "Why did you do this?"
527    "Don't slip now Parity. Don't let him do anything funny to your mind," said Fellows.
528 Parity then raised his gun hand slightly. "Why?"
529    "Shall I not gain attention in an attempt to replace that which has replaced ME? I can NOT be refused. 
530 Due to the nature of the dissolvement of the bonds between the illustrious NET and their one time
531 former agent, the files would have liked to have assumed me 'Missing in Action' I believe the cliche goes."
532    "No, they don't. They're missing. Can't you give a simple answer anymore? Why?"
533    "Because someone from within must bring to light that even though the Organization exists, the cause must 
534 be a true one. 'The Humanity of the Service' must not be marred."
535    "Here we go again..." said Farley under his breath as he raised his other hand to support the one already
536 grasping Betsy with this dark figure in its sights.
537 "Do all you guys get this way after awhile? Start spouting philosophy?"
538    Fellows just grinned as Gaudy took another step towards the dark figure.
539    "It is not a philosophy. It is Life itself. Understand and you may live."
540 Things were going from bad to confused.

595      "You are WHAT?!?!?" Sandi's mother demanded.
596      "I'm leaving home. With Frank. He's going to put me in pictures, and he
597 promosed me his boss would love me. He said that I had the aura of a star, and"
598      "The aura!!!! You actually belive that lying sonofabitch?!?!? You know
599 how many girls go off to be in pictures, with the promise of being a star?!?
600 You know how many actually make it?!?!?!"
601      "Mother, you don't know Frank!" Sandi reasoned. "He would never lie to
602 me!"
603      "Ha! I wonder how many parents who slaved away for years hear that one! No
604 daughter of mine is going to Hollywood. And do you know what a bed of iniquity
605 that place is? If you don't end up as a plaything for Frank and his rich
606 friends you'll be on the streets, selling yourself for money!"
607      "Mother, "Sandi sobbed, "Frank loves me, he told me so!"
608      "Loves the thought of taking his pleasures with you, maybe. You stay
609 away from that good for nothing, forked-tongue devil!"
610      "But Moth...."
611       "That's an order!"
612      Now in tears, Sandi wallowed off to her bedroom. #If only she could MEET
613 Frank,# She thought. She thought of last night with Frank, him telling of his
614 boss, Mr. Riobaldi, that would love to have her in his pictures. Mother
615 just didn't understand......
