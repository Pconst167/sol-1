 44 "Business is business!"  Harding pronounced each sylable with a clarity and
 45 firmness that communicated the threat of death to anyone who tried to gainsay
 46 him.  Royce Harding was entirely capable of carrying out the death sentence,
 47 too.  Wasn't he the one who cold-bloodedly terminated the existence of 100
 48 crew members and their families on Asteriod Mining Station 27009 in order to
 49 eliminate the competition for selenium in that region of the asteriod belt?
 50 Oh, the official report indicated that the mining station had been destroyed by
 51 an explosion caused by the collision of another asteriod with their own.  Who
 52 was going to challenge the official findings of the Inner Belt Mining Regulator
 53 y Commision Saftey and Accident Board of Inquiry?  Such an august board of
 54 engineers and astrohysicists, mostly on the payroll of Mr. Royce Harding!
 55  
 56 However, such thoughts wouldn't help the crew of Mass Driver B-111 at all, nor
 57 me in particular.  The thought of being a "victim of an unfortunate accident in
 58 space" made me at once sick and angry.  His thugs had already herded my crew of
 59 four back onto my ship, sans space suits of course.  I imagined that his men
 60 were setting things up for the "accident" so that all would appear normal when
 61 our mass conversion unit exploded, sending the crew compartment hurtling off
 62 into space with major damage to the life support and communications systems.
 63 His ship would get there too late to save us, unforuneatly.  And since our
 64 payload would be just sitting there, possibly causing danger to others, he
 65 would, out of a strong sense of civic duty, attach one of his own mass drivers
 66 to it and head back to the processing station, there to recieve a large 
 67 commission, not to mention large revenues.
 68  
 69 "Miss Jansen."  He paused.  I hated the old form of address.  Could he see that
 70 in my face, and would he care?  "You are probably wondering why you weren't
 71 taken back to your ship with the rest of your crew."  He waited for some sign
 72 from me.  His face had a Cheshire cat smile that was infuriating.  However, I
 73 was like a mouse trapped by a cat, and we both knew it.  "Yes, the thought had
 74 crossed my mind.  I'm sure it's not out of compassion," I said as sarcastically
 75 as I could.  What did I have to loose?  The sting of his space suit glove
 76 accross my face brought me up straight.  "Excellent!  I like a spirited woman.
 77 However, don't let your cockiness get you into a position from which you can't
 78 recover.  To be sure, it was not out of compassion that I separated you from
 79 your crew.  You are one of the best commanders in the entire Mining
 80 Organization.  I'm always on the lookout for good 'men'."  I bristeled again,
 81 and he hit me again.  "Spirit is one thing, insolence another.  I didn't take
 82 you for a fool, Jansen.  Perhaps your reputation is false?"  "What are you 
 83 offering me, Harding?  The chance to work for you, to kill innocent people, so
 84 that your profit margin will stay nice and fat?  You know me better than that.
 85 I'm not crazy about death, either.  Have you another offer?"
 86 He looked at me in silence.  What was he up to?  There was that Cheshire cat
 87 smile again.

136 	A silent and heatless column of silver flame rose from the narrow
137 dirt path.  The column rose six feet upwards before the base left the
138 ground, then faded quickly to show the gnomish figure which had been hidden
139 within the argent brilliance.
140 	Grann moved slowly down the path, taking in the peaceful scene
141 about him.  The birds began to sing again, having been startled by the
142 flames and now calm once more.  Grann walked farther along the path, until
143 he came to a somehow familiar clearing.
144 	A circle of stones and a few old logs marked a campsite, not many
145 days old.  But the place itself brought different visions to the gnome.
146 When he did not look directly at the camp, it felt like Innisfall.  Grann
147 put down his pack.  "Well," he muttered, "is it or isn't it?"
148 	A robed figure appeared from the edge of the clearing.  His face
149 was completely concealed by the dark blue cowl.  He stepped forward.
150 "I was hoping *you* could tell me that."
151 	The gnome jumped.  He hadn't sensed anyone within his range; and
152 his range was considerable for an apprentice.  "W-w-who are you?" he
153 managed to say.
154 	The cloaked one chuckled.  "Call me Morwin.  I seek a place.  It
155 should be here, but it is not.  Do you know of where I speak?"
156 	"Yes.  Innisfall.  The Inn is there."  Grann wondered exactly who
157 this Morwin person was, and how he had found his way here.
158 	"Do you know how to reach it now?"
159 	"No."  Grann hesitated, but had to ask.  "Do you?"
160 	Morwin chuckled again.  "Not yet, gnomish friend, not yet.  I have
161 only tread the paths of the body, 'til now."  He looked closely at the
162 circle of stones that circled small pile of ashes.
163 	"I-I'm looking for a friend of mine.  I think he's in trouble."
164 Grann said, more to calm himself before the inquisitive stranger (who still
165 was examining the stones) than for any other reason.  "His name's Milchar.
166   Do you know-"
167 	Grann found himself floating three feet from the ground, with
168 Morwin gripping his shoulders tightly.  "-him?" finished Grann.
169 	"WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF HIM, GNOME?" screamed Morwin.
170 	Grann thanked Amigc (as he had heard Milchar do) that he had been
171 taught a displacement spell.  In a blink, the gnome stood several feet
172 away from Morwin.  Two blinks later Grann's pack appeared beside him.
173 	Morwin sputtered in disbelief.  Several moments passed before his
174 temper was under control again.  Much more courteously this time, he asked,
175 "Were you his apprentice?"
176 	"Yes.  How did you know him?"
177 	Morwin lifted his cowl, and allowed Grann to see his face.  He
178 looked remarkably like...
179 	Morwin laughed aloud.  "Fate of birth.  I am his brother."

245      "Yuck." said Zephyr "This does NOT look good."
246      The void was no longer formless.   It now had form, but not the proper
247 kind of form.  Right now it looked as though every single law of the universe
248 the Psycho-Enhancer had taught him was a lot of bat guano.  It looked like the
249 laws he had known BEFORE the Enhancer were all a lot of bat guano.
250      How could there be TWO INNS?
251      Sure, everyone knew that weird things took place there, but this one was
252 took the cake.
253      How long had it been since Zephyr  had first walked through those doors.
254 Of course, he had been different in form then, and was not able to realize his
255 true potential.
256      Then he met Zeb...
257      Perhaps, he thought, that hadn't been such a wise move.
258      Zeb was what you'd call an intergalactic generic rebel.
259      He also had the most annoying habit of speaking very eloquently when in
260 dire situations.  Unfortunately, the personality had overlapped upon Zephyr's
261 when Zeb has used the Enhancer to give  Zephyr human knowledge to match his 
262 human form.  
263      Zephyr also had an uncanny knack of remmbering lots of television trivia.
264 He learned it from Zeb, and Zephyr didn't even WATCH television.
265      He suddenly looked out at the void and realized how tired he was after
266 examining every inch.  There would be time enough for explanations as to how 
267 there could exist two Inns later.  Again he looked out at the void.
268      "I can't believe I scanned the whole thing." he groaned, and fell back
269 into the bliss of void-sleep.

314 Concerned Reader? What a mis-named nom-de-plume. If you wish to level the hated
315 twit word at people, make darn well sure you aren't open up to that particular
316 name yourself, oh user of UPPER CASE only. You should know better by now.
317 June, just ignore the mashers. They tend to lose interest after a few days.
318 In the more sticky situations, they stay around for a few weeks. But they
319 always leave eventually. One can only go so far on the trit amusements of
320 making an ass out of one's self. It gets old rather quickly.
321  
322 As for the ad. It was quick, especially at 1200 baud. It was to the point. It
323 is not plastered to the beginning of every disk. The questions that should be
324 asked are "Does any retailer or wholesaler in his or her right mind think that
325 anyone who uses backwater is going to actually spend real money on computer
326 equipment?"
327  
328 Or... Perhaps this is another psychological test, such as the WHO CARES and
329 the SPELL CHECK tests, where the users of Backwater were forced to confront
330 two potentially annoying and/or thought provoking message threads. The
331 reactions of the users were then downloaded, categorized, and used in part
332 of a larger study on human reaction to different stimuli. The word might
333 have spread among Portland State University psych students. Backwater is a
334 singular location for a good cross section of the populace (the exact
335 determining factors escape me right now, but they are recorded). This
336 small computer ad could be another attempt at getting sample reactions to
337 a sudden burst of crass commericialism on an popular writers board. In a
338 few hundred lines, there have already been several comments on just that
339 subject. Of course the conversation has dejenerated a bit, but the causal
340 factors are still the active ingrediant. If it is an experiement, no doubt
341 once again Backwater has come through with outstanding data on how people
342 react to things.
343  
344 Or it could be someone trying to make a fast buck.

351 The people who look into this mad house are a normalized cross-section
352 of society? I seriously doubt it! At least given from what I have seen.
353 So I'm a "twit" eh? Interesting to say the least. At least I now have 
354 one person's viewpoint of what a twit is (such an elusive thing to describe!)
355 Actually, my main point in this whole thing is that if you take such things
356 as name calling and strongly opinionated comments by others too seriously
357 you are going to get hurt quite often in life. No mater what you say or
358 do, there are going to be those who dislike it. It is not a reflection on
359 them or you, only repeated proof that people are different and have different
360 views on the world. Differences in what they like or dislike. Some people
361 like to be spoilers, to stir up trouble and get people excited about something.
362 What the excigement is about seldom matters, only that they react, thus giving 
363 the spoiler a sense of control over others and thus themselves. Others are 
364 despoilers, always striving to keep things calm and quiet. This too gives them 
365 a sense of control over their enviornment. In between are those that drift
366 with the tide, not trying to control anyone. Instead they work to adjust 
367 their own lives and views to fit what they desire. Instead of trying to 
368 force the world to be what they deem it should be, they accept the world 
369 for what it is and adjust themselves to live within those parameters.
370 None are good or bad, all are an esential part of life.

373 	Emu had waited a long time for a chance like this.   What started
374 as a child's dream was now rapidly becoming a reality.  It would change his
375 whole life: but his life, up to now, had been in anticipation of this
376 change.
377 	Emu looked again at the letter.  It was addressed to him, but the
378 name inscribed was not 'Emu', his common name.  Instead, the name inside
379 was his true name, the name given him by Pater.  As in the custom Emu
380 learned, this usage was by only those most trusted, and only in the most
381 formal times.
382 	This was one of those times, and Emu was elated!  He would soon be
383 there, helping push back the barriers, while learning how to define and
384 conquer his own barriers.
385 	Images of his past mentors went through his mind's eye.  There was
386 Sommers, who taught Emu to understand what exists beond the third
387 dimension;  Jan Reed, who gave enlightenment towards infinity;  Cadams, who
388 showed that there's more than one way to skin a cockroach; and CBaogh, who
389 taught enthusiasm and drive.  Later mentors, fine tuning Emu's intellect,
390 were Tristan, bringing magic;  Karen, bringing semantics.
391 	And Pieter.
392 	Emu chuckled at the image that Pieter had become.  Pieter had been
393 an 'insurmountable' barrier, deemed impossible by many others.  Emu had
394 even conquered Pieter.  At one time Pieter had represented the biggest
395 barrier for Emu.  Now, a symbol for future 'insurmontable' barriers.
396 	Biggest of all of the images in Emu's mind, was that of Pater. 
397 Always there, always helping.  Pater introduced Emu to machines, and Paer
398 taught Emu to be human.
399 	They all worked together to help shape, guide, and groom Emu, and
400 now Emu had that chance.
401 	Emu has been accepted as an apprentice to The Cube.

452 	The land in which Gary Nadey found himself was in no way like the
453 California suburb he had departed from.  Small animals scurried away from
454 Nadey, startled by his odd arrival.  A fresh summer breeze stirred the
455 long green stalks of the plants, which rustled fainly.  Colorful birds of
456 every description flitted quickly through the clearing, which was bounded
457 mainly by the small white flower of the Dogwood tree.  The scene was that
458 of a peaceful forest- except for one very odd detail.  The sky was blue.
459 	That, in itself, should not be surprising.  However, the shade of
460  azure Nadey gazed at for some minutes was a deep blue, much darker than
461 the lighter shade he had seen all of his life.  Gary's adventures began
462 with this small hint that all was not as it should be.
463 	A mistake in handling the controls of the FEGS was to be expected,
464 considering the terribly complex functions it could perform.
465 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
466 	The FEGS: Force and Energy Guidance System.  Intermediate vector
467 bosons directed in a precise manner produced a secondary field effect that,
468 put simply, could direct energy.  Boson physics was then an obscure yet new
469 branch of science, regarded by most scientists of the time as an intellectual
470 curiosity of no practical value whatsoever.
471 	It was very near the end of a 19-hour long lab session at the
472 University when Gary stumbled upon the effect.  He had been experimenting
473 with a boson field's effect on light rays, with little success.  As Gary
474 was making an ajustment on his boson generator, he recieved a call from
475 one of his students.  While he talked, absent-mindedly fiddled with the
476 generator controls, then stopped.  After the call, Nadey forgot what he had
477 been doing, and left the generator at the new setting.
478 	When Gary next activated his apparatus, the entirety of the Science
479 Complex plunged into blackness.  A crackle of electricity in the room
480 alerted him to a possible malfunction, and he immediately shut down his
481 experiment.  Suddenly, the Complex was again alight.  To his suprise, he
482 found a tremendous charred area on a countertop over twelve feet away from
483 his experiment.
484 	At first, Nadey did not realize what he had accomplished.  Several
485 days of calculations provided him with a theory.  He was able to easily
486 repeat the results, causing puzzlement among the remainder of the Science
487 staff when they found themselves unable to see a thing in a brightly lit
488 building.  Finally he discovered he had redirected all of the light within
489 the building onto that counter, along with some other forms of energy that
490 happened to be captured by the effect.
491 	Several of the other scholars were by then engaged in an informal
492 search, seeking out the cause of the phenomena that frankly had them
493 stumped.  Not one could guess at the cause.  Nadey continued to experiment
494 all the while, finally finishing the device in time to avoid the prying
495 questions of his collegues.
496 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
497 	Nadey tore his eyes away from the sky, and looked about him.  A
498 narrow path, unnoticed before, became faintly discernable.  A moment
499 later, Gary began to hike in the direction he believed was best.

594 To the person who left the nice comment many 100's of lines ago about the 
595 Jansen story:  Thank you very much!  I might add, that my story had nothing to
596 do with the advertisment preceding it.  I want to stay out of the whole "pen-
597 wars" thing entirely.  I don't care what gets posted here as long as there is

600 The stinging sensation was beginning to dull a little, but the sick feeling
601 in my stomach was intensifying.  He had me where he wanted me, and we both 
602 knew it.  I could either accept his offer and condemn my crew to death, or get
603 myself and my crew killed.  His next statement brought me out of my inner
604 struggle.
605 "Thorndrake, Hobbs; take Miss Jansen to the 'guest suite'.  Then finish off the
606 crew."
607 There was no time to think or to lose.  I lunged for Hardy and hit him with th
608 top of my head, right in the nose.  I felt a sharp pain at the top of my skull
609 but was even more suprised by what happened next.  I felt his grip loosen and
610 then felt his hands slip off my arms.  I looked up and saw blood on his face
611 and a dull look in his eyes.  The weight of his dead body crashed on top of me
612 before I could get out of the way.  The gaurds rushed up and pulled him off me.
613 "He's dead,"  said Thorndrake.
614 "What do we do now?"  mumbled Hobbs, with a note of anxiety in his voice.

693 XLISP Program Plays Risk
694  
695 Because of it's complexity, the Parker Bothers board game Risk offers a good
696 model for AI planning systems. Scott Welser, an engineer at KnowledgeWare
697 (Ann Arbor, MI), is designing a plan-generation program to play Risk.
698     The game is based on a model of world conquest. Players take turns trying
699 to conquer countries and attempting to occupy whole continents. The outcome of
700 each assault is decided by rolling dice.
701     Wesler's program, called Alex, was written in XLISP. (XLISP, by the way,
702 is a low-cost implementation of LISP written by BIX's own programmer-in-
703 rsidence, David Betz.) In its current form, Alex runs on an IBM PC.
704     Because of the large number of possible moves in Risk, and the random
705 nature introduced by the dice, a common search tree of all possible moves and
706 countermoves would be impossible to build. As an alternative, Alex uses a
707 planning system. In this system, the goal of winning the game is divided into a
708 series of tasks, which are subdivided in turn into a series of subtasks. At
709 ehturn in the game, Alex's Task Noticer filters out those tasks that are not
710 possible to accomplish and ranks the desirability of those that are. Alex then
711 executes the most desirable of the possible task plans.
712     Although the program cannot yet play a full game, it can plan and execute
713 the beginning moves. Wesler said it will be a relatively easy task to add a
714 number of tasks for finishing the game.

718 	Grann was stunned by this news.  Milchar had never mentioned any
719 relatives, most certainly not any brothers.  Pondering upon it now, Grann
720 could not recall Milchar ever commenting about his past, except now and
721 then recalling an adventure shared by The Doctor.
722 	Morwin sat down upon a log, and motioned Grann to do the same.
723 "I apologize for my rudeness...but plead extenuating circumstances.  Perhaps
724 things would be clearer for you if I outlined why I am here."
725 	Grann nodded, and sat down.  "I think so, too.  I am named Grann.
726 Why did Milchar never speak of you?"
727 	"I believe he was somewhat ashamed of us.  He never accepted his
728 heritage, or his family.  He tried to work for what he felt were the Good
729 forces in the universe... I believe he thought that he must balance the
730 evil that the rest of the family did."
731 	Grann hardly knew what to think of this, so kept his face blank as
732 he said, "Go on."
733 	"Since you do not know of our family, let me tell you of us.  You
734 feel you know Milchar, but did you know he is not really human?  None of
735 us are.  His father was Jarin Corey, a great-great grandson of the famous
736 Corwin.  Blood from that line contains power.
737 	"My own father was human, in a dimension far from this.  He is
738 not important, except that I inherited my human form from him.  I am the
739 neutral child, seeking my own gain.
740 	"Cynthia is our sister.  Her father was a demon from some hell
741 best left forgotten, except by my mother.  She does the evil that my
742 brother tries to balance.
743 	"Our mother.  None of us know her origins.  We have seen some of
744 her souvenirs.  If they are to be believed, she is at least 5000 years old.
745 She is not extremely...fertile.  Therefore she is most protective of the
746 children she has, including Milchar, who she has not been able to contact
747 for several Tuhngaol.
748 	"My mission here is simple, now that you know all of this."  Morwin
749 paused.  "Mother wants me to find him."
750 	"And you, with powers beyond human knowing, cannot find him?"
751 	Morwin nodded.  "Milchar excelled in Travelraft.  I did not.
752 Illusion and Summon magicks are mine to command, but the planes themselves
753 heed me but little."
754 	"Can't you summon Milchar?"  asked the gnome, unsure of the 
755 possiblities of Summoncraft.
756 	"I cannot.  He seems to be beyond my reach, somehow..."  Morwin
757 trailed off.  "He may be dead."
