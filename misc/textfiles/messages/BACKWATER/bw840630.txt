35 Man in Grey: Your second guess is correct.  I just wanted an insight on how 
36 a juvie hunter works.  I think I get the concept now- you think like a juvie.
37 %%%%%%%%%%%
38 All: Since Milchar is in the twilight zone, I have decided to keep him there
39 until further notice.  Perhaps he went to study under his mentor.

41 Grand Dragon Master: Don't give out any awards yet, I haven't tried yet...

43 Setting: The 51st floor of the McKane Building.
44 "Martha, put a scramble on this room.  I am not to be disturbed."
45 "Yes sir.  Will you have some coffee, Mr.....?"
46 A tall man that rather looked like he had walked out of a science fiction book
47 was seated opposite McKane, and he shook his head.  Martha leaves.
48 As the door shuts, a low tone tells of the scramble on the room....
49 "They know.  They think I've gone too far.  I want protection.", McKane 
50 whispered, as if afraid.
51 "You're asking a lot, Mr. McKane.  Those people are tough.  After their run-in
52 with C they'll be on their toes."
53 "I don't care.  C was a fool.  I'm sorry I hired him."
54 "Now is not the time for regrets.  What is your payment?"
55 "What is it that you want?", snapped McKane, suddenly suspicious.
56 "The Inn itself.", was the man's quiet reply.
57 "What!  The Inn!  That is one thing you shall not have!  That will be mine!"
58 As McKane says this, he pounds his fist upon the mahogany dtable, sending 
59 ashtrays flying.
60 "Then you shall not have my protection.  Or your life, after you are found."
61 McKane whimpers a little, and finally mumbles, "All right."
62 "Good.  First, sign this contract.  I trust you no farther than I have to."
63 McKane reluctantly signs, and hands the paper back to the man.  "What now?"
64 "I shall prepare a surprise for any who wish you harm.  You are in my care,
65 and so you shall not die."
66 "I, Sundownor, declare it."

69 "The best place to get at McKane appears to be his headquarters, in Oklahoma.",
70 mused L'homme as he guided his car through the rush hour traffic. "That will
71 be the best place to get at him. That is the last place he would suspect
72 anything...at the place he is the most protected". L'homme thought of many
73 things as he finally reached the outer limits of the traffic jam, and sped
74 onward over the interstate. "I have plenty of money from the sale of my house,
75 the car has been tuned and is running like a top, and I know my objective...
76 But I will need some help...One man can not do it alone..." Just as this
77 last thought entered L'hommes mind, one of the boxes Bard had given him
78 started to beep. L'homme pulled over at the first rest area and stopped.
79 Placing the box in his lap, L'homme opened the plastic covered lid. With
80 this action, the beeping stopped, and the afternoon light revealed a
81 futuristic phone set and several rows of buttons. "This must be the network
82 device Bard told me about before I left the Inn!" There must be an incoming
83 message, but from whom?" Picking up the headset, and placing what appeared
84 to be the speaker end of the device to his ear, L'homme spoke into the
85 other end. "Hello? This is L'homme sans parity..." No sound came from the
86 device, and it was then that L'homme noticed one of the buttons equipped
87 with a recessed LED was flashing. L'homme pressed the button, and the
88 phone came to life in mid sentence..."but you can call me Ian... I am a 
89 friend from the network. And I can help you with your quest. I know all
90 about your adventures for the past two months, and why you have come
91 back. There are a few of us who are not fooled by the McKane person."
92 "That's great!", said L'homme, "But where and how do I meet..."
93 "Continue on to McKane Headquarters as you are doing. When you get to the
94 city, check in to the Plaza Hilton. I will contact you by net-phone there.
95 Do not lose this device!"
96 "Ok...I'll get going right away...But tell me...why are you doing this?"
97 "Your questions will be answered later...For now, be on the lookout, your
98 quest may not be as secret as you think. McKane has many powerful allies."
99 "I'll be carefull. See you soon"
100 With that, the phone set clicked off, and a light flashed 'XFER TERMINATED'
101 L'homme closed the box, and placed it in the back seat. After getting a
102 candy bar from a vending machine, he continued onward...down the interstate,
103 destination (no not the twilight zone) McKane Headquarters!

109 others who join the story (sundowner, ???)

154 .......................................................................
155 I was sitting in a sleazy bar, the kind classically associated with low
156  voices and men in trenchcoats.  The stripper on the stage was boredly going
157 through her act, and I was watching her with one eye while practicing my
158 lip reading on an intriguing conversation in the corner with the other.
159 Just when both subjects were getting to the interesting parts, I beeped.
160 Sometimes I think Ian has people watching me, and when I seem to be enjoying
161 myself too much, he decides it's time to give me a call. 'Just to make sure
162 I'm not in any trouble,' he claims.  Ha!
163   I paused for a moment, considering. If I 'heard' the rest of the converstion in the corner, I would have a good chance of
164 cutting myself in on some money. If I went for the chic on the stage, well... But, as usual, curiosity got the getter of me.
165 Calls from Iam usually gave me shots at both, plus as much excitement as I could handle.
166      I finished my drink in a gulp, gave a parting drool at the stripper,
167 and headed toward the door.  As I passed the table with the interesting
168 conversation, I slowed long enough to mutter, "I'd try a different
169 route if I were you - last I heard, Dmitri is a TRIPLE agent."  As they gaped at me, I
170 smiled and strolled out.
171      Reaching my rented car, I gave it a cursory inspection, then climbed
172 in.  Fumbling beneath the seat, I pulled out my 'box'.  Swiftly ( but
173 carefully) I disarmed all booby traps, then opened it.  Among all the usual tools of my trade, there was another box, with a
174 a plastic covered lid.  Disarming this one too, I opened it to see the communications setup which
175 Ian had so reluctantly entrusted me with.  Putting on the headset, I pressed
176 the button with the flashing light, labeled 'Channel D'.  I think Ian used
177 to work with Napolean Solo, and still misses it.
178      I waited until I heard the carrier tone in the headset, then typed in my
179 coded ID.  A twenty-seven digit number is not the easiest thing to remenber,
180 but with Ian's advanced training techniques, I quickly learned it.
181 (Some day I'd pay him back for that.  For two days after, ALL I could think
182 of was that stupid number.)
183 After the machine decided I was worthy to speak to His Magnificence, I heard
184 Ian's voice. "Hello, Jim. Hope I didn't drag you awaw from anything important."
185 I could hear the insincerity in his voice, so replied "Not a thing.  Just
186 catching up on my sleep.  I was hoping I'd hear from you; I'm running low
187 on cash and I'm getting bored.  By the way, the name's 'Joshua' now.  I saw
188 'WarGames' last week, and since it was time to change my name anyway, thought
189 I'd go with that.  What's up?"
190      "Go to the airport, you'll find a chartered plane there.  The pilot will
191 have what info we have that's relevant.  You can read it on your way to
192 Oklahoma City. When you get there, check into the Plaza Hilton.  You will
193 be meeting a man there, goes by the name L'homme sans parity.  I'll call
194 you both there with further details.  To give you an idea of how careful to
195 be, I'll tell you this much now - you'll be going up against the McKane
196 organization.  Good luck."
197      The comm set went dead in my hand, and I almost went with it.  The
198 McKane organization? I'd come up second best in my last three meetings with
199 them; I had a feeling that if I failed again, it would be my last.
200 That nightclub sounded awfully inviting right now.  Oh well, it was too late
201 now to be worrying about longevity; I made that decision when I decided to drop
202 out of the monastary.
203      I went back to my hotel, got my stuff, and headed to the airport.
204 Oklahoma was several hours away.
205 ..............
206 MIKEY: uploading here is certainly an adventure!  After about 10 aborted
207 attempts, I finally got it slowed down enough that BW would accept it.
208 (except here and here when it would arbitrarily decide to drop me out of
209 ENTER mode.  
210 That's where I have the looong sentences.)  Fortunately, I don't think
211 I'm depriving TOO many people access to Backwater at 04:20. (Except MiG.)

226     The essence that was the piper was somewhat surprised to find himself a
227 few feet over his body looking back.  He did not care much for astral travel.
228 Here things were getting interesting at the inn, the network gearing up against
229 the Mcane orginazation, L'Homme about to find himself in the deep end of the
230 dirty pool (he'll win through though!), and the Grand Dragonmaster inciting
231 others to more creative mayhem.  For a moment he wavered ...
232 no ... there must be some purpose behind this.  He gave in to
233 an insistant pull and felt himself wafted quickly from the inn.

237  
238         The first tendrils of light from the east had already dispelled
239 the brave remaining ribbons of colour. The ebb of stars had begun. One 
240 by one they grew faint, bowing to the gathering momentum of a new day.
241 They, the guardians of the night , the Sun, master of the day - racing 
242 westward as if to forever remove them from the skys. Yet both were 
243 fixtures in the infinite reaches of the universe. 
244                 Again the paradox of perspective.
245         Lowering his eyes from the heavens he looked about his place of
246 refuge inwardly melancholy about his soon departure. This protected 
247 cleft had served him well. And to return its consideration he would remove
248 all marks of his passage. 
249         Gathering his possesions was an easy task, for they were few. 
250 He set about removing the traces of his stay, leaving the fire for last.
251 It had taken several hours to exorcize the remnants of civilization from
252 his campsite. And even when finished, still bore subtle reminders of its use.
253 Angered by himself for disturbing this place of solitude, he paused 
254 allowing his eye to follow the ridge of the mountain to its peak. 
255 There not 500 feet from the summit, on the wind scoured slopes of this 
256 mountain, knelt one gale ravaged noble fir, its trunk gnarled - limbs 
257 twisted, well above the treeline. He was overwhemed with a combination of 
258 compassion and respect for its tenacity. He then saddened for it too had 
259 chosen a path beyond its grasp.
260         Pausing for a few rudimentary implements, rigging knife, awl and 
261 marlinspike, the choice had been a reflex. He would return the weathered
262 fir to this ; his ; sanctuary.
263         With slow and deliberate strides he made his way up the ridge, fangs 
264 of rock reaching out to cut and slice, wind in gusts as if driven by a 
265 demons breath clawed at him. But further he went on. Reaching the fir he 
266 sat resting his tired joints. The trees precarious  grasp of life was 
267 almost over. The crevase it had chosen would not last another season, the 
268 great temperature changes had been an effective wedge - the slabs of rock the
269 sapling had come to rest between were poised ready to continue their 
270 downward migration. 
271         With practiced hands he pryed the rocks apart, shocked at the spindly
272 root system and meager amount of earth, how it had survived as long as it 
273 had was indeed testament to its will. The fir now firmly in grasp he turned 
274 his eyes westward, to the river far below. The trace it now made through  
275 the carpet of evergreen was not unlike the roots of the tree he now held
276 in his hand.  # I will be lucky to reach it by night fall # he thought.
277 Now retracing his steps down the mountain, cursing the hill as he fought 
278 his way back to " sanctuary " with the same vengance he had the sea.
279         When he reached his old campsite he rested the twisted dwarf fir near
280 his rucksack and the pulled out a large panga. Placing  his other tools on
281 the ground he began to dig. When he had finished he carefully placed the fir
282 in the hole and tamped the earth in around it. Returning to his rucksack
283 he replaced his tools, raising the sack to his shoulders he returned to 
284 the fir. Removing his water bag he took one swallow, pouring the remainder 
285 at the foot of the tortured tree. 
286         Bowing his head to the tree in silent respect he turned and took the
287 first steps toward the west, his rowan leading the way, he felt the need
288 to be near water. In the distance the rivers sound grew, as if
289  welcoming his return.
290         # To be once more among the glades # he thought.

300 .... And get me a COMPLETE dossier on this "Sundownor" that met with
301 Mckane last night." finnished MacHinery. With a frown he switched from COM mode 
302 to LOCAL.
303 ANY WORD FROM THE SPOOKS?
304 i assume you mean our agents in the fbi and cia?
305 WHO ELSE?
306 they report little progress. the reports total 1.5 megabytes, do you
307 wish to read them?
308 NO! JUST SUMMARIZE.
309 they are having trouble getting cooperation from the local authorities.
310 it would appear that direct action will 'blow their cover'. do you wish them to
311 risk revealing that their organizations are taking orders from us?
312 NO. HAVE THEM MAINTAIN AS MUCH PRESSURE AS THEY CAN, WITHOUT SEEMING TO
313 BE MORE THAN NORMAL GOVERNMENT HARASSMENT TACTICS. EVERYONE EXPECTS MCKANE TO 
314 GET THAT.
315 very well. any further instructions?
316 HAS THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL YET?
317 yes, it will be waiting for joshua and l'homme.
318 ONE MORE THING. THEY ARE TO HAVE *FULL* ACCESS TO THE NETWORK FOR ANYTHING
319 RELATING TO THE MCKANE SITUATION.
320 that is contrary to procedure.
321 IF THEY SURVIVE THEY WILL HAVE EARNED THE PRIVILEGE, IF NOT, IT WON'T MATTER.
322 true. order accepted.
323 
324 Ian sat back and thought for a while. Leaning forward again he called up
325 the file on "COUNTERFORCE". He hoped that it wouldn't be necessary, but if the 
326 agents failed...
327 Lesse now... one million 3600 rpm magnetic prayer wheels ... if the
328 figures were right they would just about neutralize Mckane's monasteries.

331 resumed his wait. Once again he sang, hoping it might serve as a focus...

333 Sentries (words & music: Leslie Fish)
334 Legends have warned us in times gone by,
335 Danger can fall on us from the sky:
336 Fire and rain, and hail, stone and flame,
337 And gods without mercy, and plagues without name.
338 
339 Science has warned us of what might be,
340 Dangers that drift through infinity:
341 Comets may call, or meteors fall,
342 And nobody knows what lives out there at all.
343 
344 Humans are hotheads who break the rules.
345 Humans are reckless, but not quite fools.
346 Therefore we fly, keeping an eye
347 Turned to the depths of the borderless sky.
348 
349 Some of us people, the rest machines --
350 Sensors, computers and read-out screens --
351 Always aware, with infinite care,
352 That we're the first warning of anything there.
353 
354 We are the sentries who guard your sleep,
355 Endless as hours in the watch we keep,
356 Holding the sky under an eye
357 As watchful as ever in ages gone by.
358 
359 Nothing is certain but death and change,
360 Earthborne or skyborne as we may range.
361 Always we fly, watching the sky.
362 Nobody Human need ever ask why!

364 As he sang, there was a shimmer in the air. If one was tuned to such things
365 they would have seen a column of light reaching towards the heavens. But to most
366 it was invisible. 
367 One patron of the inn, who had stopped to lean on the rowan tree before
368 continuing on his way, glanced up and saw it. Startled, he feel. The sight
369 vanished. He swore never again to mix peach brandy and ale!

377 Dear Monsieur d'Autun:
378 
379 So they're at it again...can you believe that? They think they 
380 can take me, LeRoy McKane, inspite of all who have failed   
381 before them.
382 
383 The Soviets couldn't get me when I kidnapped Andropov, the 
384 Americans couldn't get me when I sold arms to Kaddaffi, the 
385 Alkaseltzer people couldn't get me when I popularized primal 
386 belch therapy, why should these fools be any different?
387 
388 Oh well...there's work to be done. Here's what I want you to 
389 do. Straighten out the weather making machine business as best 
390 you can. Send flowers to L'homme at the Plaza Hilton, include
391 a note from me saying "tough luck sucker, wrong town". Have
392 the public relations department deal with this Sundowner
393 character; we don't need people spreading rumors that I'm 
394 afraid and begging for protection. And finally, send Petrov 
395 a $1000 for working as a stripper in that sleezy bar; tell him 
396 the information he delivered was well worth the money.
397 
398 Other than MacHinery getting wrapped up in this I don't see
399 that we have much to be concerned about. At least we don't 
400 have to worry about Wassir and his Albanian Revolutionary Party
401 sticking their noses into it.

405 :************************************************************:
406 Dear Papa Geonelli:
407 
408 The McKane organization does not involve itself in anything as 
409 questionable as weather making machines. This is a ligitimate 
410 business enterprise and does not indulge in fads or 
411 questionable practices.
412 
413 The advertisement you read was a fake. Only information 
414 contained within the GDM border (:********:) is of ligitimate 
415 McKane Industries origin. We regret that you have been  
416 deceived, but not everyone is as reputable as McKane 
417 Industries.

424 p.s. - I'd like to order six hundred Pizzas, thin crust, with 
425 everything, to go.

427 TO THE FRIENDS (if any) AND ENEMIES OF MCKANE INDUSTRIES
428 
429 1) The membership in Dragon Hunters International and nine 
430    hundred Krauntar reward will be awarded to anyone who makes 
431    a serious contribution to this adventure and gives me their
432    address.
433 
434 2) Since it's not nice to gang up on a Grand Dragon Master, 
435    and you are ganging up on me, I'm going to give you a chance
436    to be nice. I need some help. I'm using Superscripsit with 
437    a vidtex plus terminal program on a TRS-80 Model III. Do any
438    of you have any tips on how to successfully upload to 
439    Backwater? Retyping everything is a real pain.
440 
441 3) You guys are writing well...I'm impressed.

446   IN ORVILLE, A YOUNG HIGHSCHOOL GRADUATE TENDS THE TRANSMAT IN FOOLWELL TOWER. 
447   HIS PARENTS COULD NOT IMMAGINE WHY SUCH A NICE KID AS THEIR SON WOULD
448 WANT TO JOIN A RIGHT-WING COMMERCIAL MONISTARY.  NEAR HIS RIGHT EAR
449 A DEVICE SECRETLY IMPLANTED WHEN HE WAS LESS THAN A YEAR OLD, PUTS HIM
450 ON ALERT.  HIS SLEEP HAS ALWAYS BEEN HAUNTED BY MEMORIES OF ANOTHER WORLD.
451 THESE DREAMS HAVE TRAINED HIM FOR THE JOB THAT LIES AHEAD.  MCKANE'S 
452 TRANSMATS, WHOS VERY EXISTENCE IS UNKNOWN, EVEN TO THE MOST POWERFUL
453 GOVERNMENTS IN THE WORLD, ARE NOT WITHOUT FLAW.  THE HEAD OFFICE KNOWS
454 THIS AND ONLY USES THEM AT EXTREME NEED.  THEIR TRUSTED AND TRUSTING COURRIERS
455 ARE SENT THROUGH FREQUINTLY.  TAVIS 'TIPPY' TIP'S JOB IS TO GUARD
456 THE TRANSFER SYSTEM AT THIS END.  HE IS A TRUSTED BROTHER OF THE MCKANE ORDER
457 ALLWAYS HAVING SERVED THEM FAITHFULLY SINCE JOINING.
458 TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
459   RIGHT ON JC: MINORITY CULTS ARE THE ENIMY OF THE AMERICAN WAY; WHO
460 DOES THIS GURU PERSON THINK HE IS ANYWAY!  I AM PROUD TO SAY I DONATE HALF
461 OF EVERY PENNY I EARN TO THE MCKANE ORDER.  I KNOW THAT EVERY CONTRIBUTION
462 HELPS TO KEEP OUR GREAT TRADITIONS STRONG AND WIMPS WHO SPEEK OF CIVIL RIGHTS
463 AND RELIGEOS EQUALITY IN THE GUTTERS WARE THEY BELONG.

474   A SECRETARY WHO WAS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT THE TIME SOUNDED THE
475 ALARM WHEN SHE SAW THE SIX SEMIS PULLING INTO THE LOWERLEVEL PARKING STRUCTURE
476 OF MCKANE TOWER.  SECURITY, CHECKING THEIR MONITORS, TOLD EVERYONE TO KEEP
477 CALM.  THE TRUCKS WERE ONLY FROM THE PIZZA DELIVERY PLACE.  EACH VAN WAS CLEARLY

483 To the "NET": You guys were well advised to have changed your ciphers. For the
484 heck of it, last Friday I sat down and broke four or five of your notes.
485 A Gronsfeld cipher, eh? The way I solved it (Kerckhffs' solution) I
486 ended up with a string of letters, but I assume you were using phone numbers
487 for keys. I am still working on your new system - I'll get back to you.
488 I must say I was underwhelmed with the message content - I expected the
489 secrets of the universe, or specific details about twits - what I got
490 was discussions of sources for new keys for the cipher and other
491 mundane stuff...

495 Oh, by the way, I have been unable to get on for quite a while, and

535 Things sure seem to be slow over here on drive B, even PAM has not
536 gotten around to finishing it off. Maybe it is just too much?
537 After all, there are still 92 lines left!
538 Err, make that 91....
539 Do I hear 90?
540 Hmmm... it keeps changing.
541 I guess I'll stop before I run out of disk space completely.
542 After all, we have to leave something for Pam to fill!
543 By the way, that's a hint Pam. (A strong one though it may be.)
