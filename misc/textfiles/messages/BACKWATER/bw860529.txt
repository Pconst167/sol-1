20 Wow!  Joshua finally gets the top.
21 Warning - the next 55 lines contains boring narrative - normal BackWater returns circa line 75.

23    His fist flew toward my face; I blocked it ude-uke.  I responded with my own seiken-suzi, but he grabbed my arm and
24 pulled me over his hip, kicking at my groin as I struggled for balance.  I again managed to deflect his strike, and
25 backed up slightly to give myself a chance to regain my composure.  This sucker was good!  I was generally considered
26 one of the best in hand-to-hand combat, but so far this guy had kept me mostly on the defensive.  I watched him now,
27 waiting for his next move.  It would start with a kick, either mikazuki-geri or mai-tobi-geri.  I saw him shift his
28 weight slightly, and suddenly my head exploded.
29    Consciousness signalled its return with a throbbing in my mouth and a pounding in my temple.  I reached up and felt
30 a cold towel across the side of my face.  My erstwhile opponent's face came into view and asked concernedly, "how do
31 you feel, Joshua?  You've been out for about half an hour."
32 "Well, isn't that a kick in the head," I joked weakly.  "I don't really know what happened, Sensei.  I was waiting for
33 you to kick, but I must have missed it.  It didn't miss me, though, heh heh oooh."
34 "Yes, I could see you setting up.  But when I moved, you just stood there with a glazed look on your face.  I thought
35 it might be a ploy, but you never moved and finally it was too late for me to stop.  Pardon me for saying, but have
36 you been spending too much time indulging in the pleasures of Nirvana and not enough in meditation and exercise?"
37    While he was talking, I had been exploring the aching tooth with my tongue. I suddenly realized that the tooth was
38 the special one NET had installed, containing certain signal receptors, including the one called the 'Doomsday Alarm'.
39  It had been demonstrated to me once, and its effects were certainly enough to distract me at a crucial moment.  Such
40 as in the middle of a fight. As its nickname implied, its activation implied some major catastrophe, and all
41 recipients were required to drop what they were doing and report to the nearest briefing station ASAP.
42    I made some feeble excuses to my instructor, and hurried off to the locker room for a quick shower and some clean
43 clothes.  The trick tooth was limited to those in the upper echelons, and since the Sensei obviously hadn't received
44 the signal, he didn't have the security clearances necessary for me to explain the situation.  My pride didn't want me
45 to leave him thinking I had been slacking off, but the well-trained agent ("well-conditioned, you mean," my inner
46 voice muttered derogatorily) knew how to ignore such distractions as pride.
47    A short time later, clean and tastefully attired in the generic blue jump- suit that everyone wore in-house, I
48 strode down a long, echoing corridor toward the security desk for this level.  On either side were doors, most closed,
49 many with red or green lights above them.  The red lights of course meant Do Not Enter, as there was either a highly
50 secret or highly dangerous activity taking place within (or both).  If I were to attempt to enter, I would be rendered
51 unconscious in some clever, unpleasant manner, hopefully awakening later in security detention.  What happened next
52 would depend on many factors, but even the lightest of punishments would wipe out years of advancement. The
53 Organization was very jealous of its secrets.
54    Behind the less well-guarded doors were more plebeian activities - unarmed combat (karate, judo, street fighting,
55 etc.), weapons training (ranging from 'how to kill a tank with a stick and a rock' to the high-tech James-Bondish
56 nuclear powered death-rays so dear to some agents' hearts), first aid (basic bandages to EMT 4), the care and feeding
57 of booby traps... everything required to turn a normal human being into something that could take Rambo apart in 5
58 seconds and put him back together again, plus brain.  When the normal agents- on-the-street thought of Nirvana, they
59 saw only the beautiful women, saunas, tennis, and the other more ostentatious trappings.  What they didn't see was the
60 other half - the intensive training which made those luxuries necessities. Only the elite made it to Nirvana, and once
61 there, they worked like they never worked before, fine-tuning their already excellent abilities.  They worked hard,
62 they played hard.  There was no such thing as 'taking it easy'; EVERYTHING was done at a feverish pitch.  The
63 institution known as Nirvana was in fact a wonderous machine; nothing was wasted.  The public side with its 'beautiful
64 people', gambling/gaming, casual drugs and sex was indeed the R&R center for NET.  It was also, as mentioned, the Yin
65 for the Yang of the hard-studying elite. Not widely known, however, was the fact that most of the workers in the
66 pleasure center were also agents-in-training, learning how to use vices to elicit information from their subjects, as
67 well as testing the abilities of the visiting agents to resist such temptations. Wheels within wheels, another earmark
68 of the Organization.
69    As I neared the security desk, I recognized the guard as one of my instructors in Surveillance Techniques.  She in
70 turn recognized me as one of her instuctors in The Use of Computers in Data Acquisition, Synthesis and Interpretation.
71 (Familiarly known as How to Redirect the Entire City's Electric Bills to Your Victim's Account).  Mutual recognition
72 notwithstanding, we still had to go through the usual rigamarole - I gave her my ID card and stuck my face in the
73 retinal scanner while she matched the patterns against what was encoded on my card.  After she verified my existence
74 and returned my card, she gave me a quick but passionate kiss, told me to be careful, and let me through the door to
75 the secure briefing room.  NET may be big and impersonal, but they know how to send an agent on a mission.

77 A passionate kiss is never quick.

94 It's just like I said a long time ago-there are certain Backwaterites that have special editing priveledges...
95 One of them travels around with a specially equipped vehicle, and log onto BBS's and check the spelling of various
96 entries. Another has a mainframe the size of a cabin cruiser, and uses a special program to identify twits. (These

136           Bard regained conciousness slowly. The last he remember was being
137 in a chlorine breathing alien's lab. Then everything faded out...
138           A distant voice was saying something....
139           "Can you hear me, sir?"
140           He opened his eyes to find himself floating between the grav 
141 plates of a hospital bed. "Where am I and how'd I get here?"
142           "This is Survey Base Samekh. You and your conveyor were brought 
143 in a couple of months ago. As I recall it was a magic-user of some sort..."
144           Base Samekh! That was the base he'd been doing the prelim survey
145 work for. But a couple of *months* in the hospital...Great Ghu, he'd be in
146 debt for decades.
147           Then he remembered how badly the conveyor had been damaged.
148 Better make that a few centuries of working off the debt.
149           But the med-tech was continuing...
150           "...said his name was Mill-Char? Something like that."
151           "Right. Milchar."
152           Bard seemed to be alright so the tech 'told' the bed to 'release'
153 him. As Bard stood and stretched the tech held out a display flat.
154           Bard steeled himself for the bad news.
155           "Five megacredits!"
156           Then he saw that that wasn't a bill, it was an account balance.
157 Quickly 'paging' thru the display, he realized what had happened. Milchar
158 had left half a *kilo* of Aregentium. That plus the contact bonus for 
159 making peaceful contact with Straxi's people had left him not only debt 
160 free, but almost comfortably well off.
161           An hour later he finished a debreifing and left the base.
162 Destination: Innisfall.

164 Milchar: well, now Mikey, Piper and I are accounted for. How about you &
165 the others?

170 	I have a golden ring.  I tell others that the ring symbolizes the
171 universe.  The flaked away areas, where the gold is long gone, that
172 represents entropy.  Everything falls to waste.  The ring could mean
173 something special to me, but it doesn't.
174 	Hidden inside the ring is a talon.  I willfully scratch myself with
175 it each morning as a reminder should I wear another in the name of 'love'
176 I'll only be scatching, cutting my heart to pieces.
177 	The ring is a sign of woman's lies while my wound is an open

179 	Some women are never to be trusted, all we are to them is a game...

189 Dot tried to wipe away some of the coffee she had poured on the counter.
190 Truckers, diesel, and open highway was not her element, and it showed. Every
191 whistle from one of the monsters set her fingers to shaking, and the coffee
192 spilt on the formica top of the diner counter. Each rude remark by a dimwit
193 driver made her look away from the tray she carried and she had to mop up te
194 dishes later. Only to recieve more suggestions from the truckers.
195  
196 It might have been the low cut of the pink uniform, or her face. She had bee
197 a model in high school, even got to walk on the stage in front of the studen
198 body. But then she graduated, and never left the house again. A driver came
199 along, she married him thinking it was the right thing to do. Only later did
200 she figure out that she could have done anything she wanted. By then it was
201 too late.
202 She left him. Taking to the highways and truck stops, she had evaded him ths
203 long only by her kindness to strangers. Not the other way around since
204 strangers are not kind, as a rule.
205 Timidly she gathered the empty sugar bottles onto a table in the corner.
206 Removing the tops, she heaved the sugar sack over the bottles and poured.
207 Granules spead across the table top silently amidst the noise of the diner.
208 Each one was poured into until the sack was gone. And then she looked up.
209  
210 "Delmar? Why, what are you doing here? I told you not to follow me, why don'
211 you just leave me alone?" Her frightened voice gathered the attention of a fw
212 truckers who turned slowly. She scrambled to put the tops on the bottles as
213 her husband whispered insults to her.
214 "Leave me alone, Delmar, I don't love you anymore, can't you understand that"
215 Dot felt her nerve buckling, and her legs nervously wandering under the tabl
216 in search of a footing. To no avail, Delmar kept naming her a whore. Soon he
217 rose to his feet and lifted his arm as if he was about to hit her.
218  
219 One of the men from across the diner wiped his mouth and lifted himself fro
220 his stool. Not daring to show his intense fear of the huge trucker that lookd
221 as if he would kill the girl.
222 Delmar sat down again. Placed his hand around the glass of water he had askd
223 for at the counter. His knuckles whitened under the strain of his muscles an
224 his eyes filled with water. Then his whispers were laced with emotion, he
225 pledged his love for her, and swore never to hit her again.
226 The man from across the diner leaned into the bar and ordered a large ice
227 cream float. Biding his time to see what might happen at this point. The
228 truckers in the place were paying no attention, since any one of them had ben
229 in the situation before.
230  
231 Glass shattered from the tumbler inside of Delmar's fist. His face showed th
232 torture. Delmar took to his feet and grasped his red hand with the healthy
233 one, accusing Dot of his injury. Dot was not holding up well. Her hair had
234 fallen out of place. She was biting her lip hard.
235 At once the man from across the room was there. He asked Delmar by his firs
236 name to come with him, to go drink and talk about it. This was like tossing 
237 red cape in front of a Spanish bull in heat. The red stained hand balled up
238 into a fist and at once he was flying at the man from across the room.
239  
240 It was then the ice cream float spread across the floor like the grains of
241 salt had before. Delmar tumbled and slid a good few feet. Friction wounded is
242 knees and ripped his levis. In an instant Dot was hustled out of the diner nd
243 onto the back of an olive drab motorcycle. As it spun dirt out from under i,
244 the cycle moaned with the weight of the pair. And lost among the moan was th
245 question, "Who are you?"

283 Small ether waves parted before the bow of the R.S. "Razor's Edge", which 
284 glided smoothly through a sea of swirling mists and "parlashi-kaarin", the
285 ether-fish.  The Razor was a sleek reality-hopping sailboat guided by the
286 spell and stave of her mage-captain, who was wondering how Bard was enjoying
287 the funds that the Argentium had brought there in his native world.  It would
288 be used to build ultra-high energy power plants.  The stuff made an amazing
289 catalyst in all types of reactions.
290 The ship cut a tunnel toward a blue haze in the distance- it was time to return
291 to Celene, at least for the nonce.  Several things required special care in
292 the tower.  Spring cleaning was long overdue.
293 A brilliant flash of yellow light illumniated the deck, blinding Milchar for
294 a few moments.
295 '"What's for dinner," asked Pooh,' said Grann, stepping out of the yellow
296 light and onto some of the rigging, where he hung there until the mage could
297 see again.
298 'Grann, you rascal!  Where have you been?  You missed all the excitement,
299 really.  Although I suppose I could find the father of that big slimy brute
300 and make introductions.'
301 'Perhaps later.  Say, that Doctor fellow isn't around, is he?  Some of that
302 Coke swill sounds good about now.'
303 Milchar smiled.  'He's not here, but I'll see what's at home.  You're just
304 in time to help with the Annual Cleaning.'
305 Grann jumped down to the deck.  'Ah, well.  My sense of timing always did
306 need work.  Now honestly, what's this about a slimy brute?'
307 The parlashi-karrin were, for quite some time, startled at the sound of
308 laughter that the gnome and mage made as they traded stories.
309 Perhaps they were startled by the Razor itself, which seemed to laugh along
310 with its passengers as they sailed toward the ever-brighter realm of Celene.

312           "...but those units have such low performance. And they're so
313 OLD. Surely you'd rather have a more modern personal shift unit?"
314           "Look... *I'm* paying for it. The performance is adequate. And
315 more importantly I can fix those 'old, obsolete' units in the field with a
316 portable toolkit."
317           Bard shook his head over the ignorance of the supply clerk. What
318 was he supposed to do? Haul along several hundred cubic meters of test and
319 repair equipment. Hah!
320           Well, that was the last item on the list. He went over to the
321 departure area and filed his trip plan with the computer. Ghu! He'd be glad
322 to get away from all these regulations. Almost as bad as home...
323           Home... he hadn't thought of it for awhile. He pushed the images
324 out of his mind. Why had they had the misfortune to be one of the lines
325 that was randomized by their first interdimensional transfer experiments..
326 He only knew of a handful of lines that had done so badly... And his was
327 the only one with a single known survivor... 
328           Damn those regulators and their "safety precautions"...
329           He pulled himself back together as he triggered his shift unit.

333 Of a life in space on the edge of fear
334 For we are the men who dwell in the hell
335 That's still called home for an engineer.
336 Chorus:	So here's to the man with his hand on Hell
337 	And the fires that flame in the fusion burn.
338 	So toss off a beer to the engineer
339 	If he's gonna live long then he'll live and learn.
340 Some men hear the song of the stars
341 In every throb of a star ship's drive,
342 And some men find their peace of mind
343 In the hell where the drive field's kept alive.
344 CHORUS
345 The trail to the stars is long and wide
346 And littered with bodies of ships and men.
347 It's the price we've paid for the roads we've made
348 That many will not see home again.
349 CHORUS
350 Engineers are only men,
351 For each mistake they make, they pay.
352 On one man's hands ride a hundred lives
353 And hope they'll see another day.

390 AND AH- YOURE THE LUCKY ONE
391 BUT oH- SOMETIMES YOU WANT IT ALL
392 YOUVE GOT TO REACH FOR THE SUN.

404 AND NEVER LEAVE THE GROUND
405 AND STILL YOU DONT KNOW WHY

449 L'homme sans Parity -	I've thrown away hours of work, as we've decided,
450 			by taking all my archive disks and doing the great
451 "rm *.*"  Bad news, one of your in/famous generic disks gave me a nasty
452 format error.  You can take it up with the insurance co. to get a
453 replacement; I'll be spending most of this week trying to get the new,
454 sorted files transfered.

462 	SALUTATIONS !
463 
464 	Following is an excerpt from Sunburst's Revenge
465 
466 	Rean looked over the destroyed bridge.  The Imperial 
467 cruisers had effectively crippled the ship.  She gave the 
468 order to abondon ship and then hooked up her wrist comp 
469 to the main terminal and had the last of battery power diverted to 
470 the last remaining laser battery.  
471 
472 	She disconnected her computer and ran for the shuttle.
473 The destroyer was lost.

483 I think I'm crazy enough to buy it...

485 the code to him as we both have M100s.

492 In the whiskey soaked mind of an old minstrel kan
493 lies a song of hope and good will
494 It's a melody man has been yearning to hear
495 but the voice of the minstrel is still...Say a sad farwell to the downtrodden youth
496 Who had neer a chance to grow up
497 Say Kadish to minions of tortured old souls
498 Who the good life never did sup.
499 Cry a tear for the soldiers who died without cause
500 Lives lost at the stroke of a pen
501 And shudder inside of the pow'r of the rich
502 And demand it not happen again
503 In the whiskey soaked mind of an old minstrel man

516    "Home. Home. Home again." Cragmore chanted the Power-word. With his arms,
517 he had created a circle of one. Not as powerful as the circles engendered by
518 many, it would hopefully be enough to achieve the desired result.
519    "Home." Once again, as Cragmore had seen so many times on this journey, his
520 surroundings shimmered as if seen through a murky stream. Blackness replaced
521 the murky sights for a time, then subdued, but clear warm light replaced the
522 dark.
523    The Inn. Its familiar smells filled Cragmore's nostrils as he took in a
524 deep breath. The solid wooden floor was in sharp contrast to the mushy ground
525 he had left. Cragmore didn't want to think about the place he had left. The
526 pain inflicted on his psi-senstive mind still echoed sharply. It was still
527 too soon to allow the memories to spill forth.
528    Cragmore stood, dusted himself off, and made his way to the fire, which
529 was crackling with perfectly cured wood. The aroma from the fire, mixed with
530 the scents of the multitude of elixers found at the Inn made Cragmore pause.
531 He stood there, eyes transfixed on the fire, all motion save breathing gone
532 from his body. He felt like standing there forever, comfortable, relaxed, warm,
533 secure. It was good. And then the feeling passed. Cragmore continued on and
534 took a seat, still near the fire, near the source of the heat, and the
535 warm feelings Cragmore felt inside.
536    As usual, the other visitors to the Inn ignored Cragmore. He was just
537 another traveller who had alternatives to the large oaken front door. They
538 had all seen it a hundred times before, and no doubt would see it a hundred
539 times again. The apathy didn't bother Cragmore. Cragmore was glad to be back
540 at the Inn. It was a time for rest and healing. Nothing could bother Cragmore
541 now.

566 Nine days till cap and gown. Incredible. I can't believe I did it. And
567 then they hand me this piece of paper that says I know something about
568 electronics. And throw me to the wolves of imperious resume' readers. 
569 Scared shitless...
570 It's like the first (and only) time I soloed. I taxied, managed to keep
571 the rudder the right way, carb heat on, mixture rich, and all that---
572 and the ground dropped away, and I looked to the right seat for Mac to
573 say-"good takeoff, no-the stall warning indicator didn't make apeep, 
574 right--- And Mac wasn't there---
575 I turned right out of the pattern, hoping unconsciously that Mac would
576 be there, but he wasn't. He was on the ground, watching.
577 "How the fuck am I going to get this thing back on the ground????
578 Well, I just remembered what Mac had taught me, and although I did scrape
579 the port wing, I walked away from it-and that is the official defenition
580 of a good landing...
581 Kicked out of the nest.Solo. Like graduating... Are you listening, Milchar?
