23 normal PorSFiS/PC&S meeting.  Due to the Westercon SF convention this
24 weekend, PorSFiS/PC&S has been cancelled.  Normal programming resumes in

29 As I sit here, unaware of any part of my body except my mind, I wonder about 
30 things. I ask of all of you, if Planck's constante were, say 10 instead of what
31 it is now, what would happen? What would be our life styles? 
32 Think of it, everything defracts everything else! Think of the social 
33 consequence of it all! Does anyone remember the equation for time dilation?
34 Something like the suare root of tau over t *C where tau was the amount of 
35 time spent in dilation and t was the dilation factor. I thing that a time travel
36 ship would be easy to construct, given that for 20 years in space at .54C you 
37 would find 30 years gone by on earth. I take trusty welding torch in hand and 
38 begin to make my ship. Does anyone know how to get clean fusion w/o ll those
39 "#$%$#ing n
40 eutrons making you ship into fissionable material? I know lithium and s few other
41 things will block it, but I want a somewhat perminante solution.

46      Tarn found himself walking in the moonlight night unable  to 
47 find sleep,  he decided to continue his trek.   Looking up at the 
48 moon,  he  is  reminded of that night long ago when he had  first 
49 come to the Inn, and the foot bridge where he had parted with the 
50 last trace of his painfull past.  
51      Though he had continued to be haunted by the specter of  the 
52 woman  who had hurt and deceived him,  at least he had broken the 
53 tie which had prevented him from continuing with his  life.   The 
54 kind  folk at the Inn had helped him to heal the wounds and  grow 
55 back  to health.   
56      They had offered companionship when he needed  friends,  and 
57 peace  when  he needed to be alone.   Tarn doubted that he  could 
58 ever repay them,  or express his gratitude enough,  but then Emer 
59 had come,  offering her friendship.  
60      At first he was delighted to just have another  friend,  but 
61 soon  he had found it grew into something more.   He had found  a 
62 kindred  soul.   Someone  he could reach his hand out to and  not 
63 have it returned as a bloody stump.  
64      Then the day came when he reached out to touch her, a desire 
65 to  bring  the friendship even closer.   Yet when he had  touched 
66 her,  she  had disappeared in a wafting cloud of coloured  smoke.  
67 After that,  she began to appear less often.   Seemingly  growing 
68 more distant with each encounter,  as if avoiding him for fear of 
69 his touch again.  
70      He  had  fallen  into remorse at this,  not knowing  how  to 
71 combat this everwidening gap.  Until finally she no longer showed 
72 up at the Inn,  and he had fallen into a deep  depression.   Then 
73 not knowing what else to do,  he had struck out in search of her, 
74 following  cold trails and missleading spores.   And now he found 
75 himself  on this mountain,  on a moolight  night,  underneath  an 
76 overhanging ledge, with no place left to search.  
77      Not  able  to go any farther,  he sat down against  a  small 
78 boulder.   How  could  he express his affection for her  when  he 
79 could  not  even find her?   Pillowing his head on his  pack,  he 
80 pulled his cloak about him,  and tried to get even a few hours of 
81 sleep. After a while, a small shudder passed thru his body. 
82 "Oh, Emer, I miss you so."

94 MIG: Yes, you are correct. The formula for time dilation is 
95 the square root of TAU over T * C. I've become very familiar 
96 with the practical aspects of this theory in my work 
97 recalibrating transmogrification guns for McKane Industries.
98 
99 I'm currently working on a feedback loop theory that would 
100 modify the time echo factor so the transmogrification gun 
101 could be used under water. I haven't been successfull yet but 
102 am expecting a break-through as soon as I get the water out 
103 of my ears.

111 If you wish to try however... 
112 1. use Meta-Y (xmit w prompt)
113 2. pick a prompt char that does NOT appear in the text
114 3. be prepared to either have the char at the beginning of every line or to use 
115 the CH function to remove it (one line at a time!)
116 4. set the margin >> your line length (MA 120 works well for 80 col lines)
117 5. after the first line is sent wait AT LEAST 10 seconds, then type the prompt
118 char.
119 6. repeat step 5 until you reach the end of text.
120 7. exit enter mode
121 8. list your msg

129 Mig: tau factor= sqaure root(1-(v^2)/(c^2))
130 mass = rest mass/tau
131 time rate = tau
132 length (in direction of travel) = rest length * tau
133 All of the above apply for CONSTANT velocity. Mass & length & time rate are good
134 AS INSTANTANEOUS VALUES ONLY if you are accelerating. I can give you formulae 
135 for calculating the elapsed time aboard a ship at constant ACCELERATION, but 
136 they are VERY messy!

153 I heard a sound near my foot.  Looking down, I noticed a throwing star
154 has just taken the laces off of my shoes. Rabindranith had a daggar out,
155 looking up at nothing. "What was that? Were you followed!" he managed
156 to get out.
157     I examined the star. The insignia on it was a stickshift.  "Probably,
158 but it dosent matter."  I tossed him the star, "Believe it or not, this 
159 came from a friend."  I knew however, that the bolo gate wouldn't last
160 much longer.  I doubt if the Ninja would be around, but I hoped he
161 arrived at his location safely.  No telling where (or when) he might land.
162     The event was quickly forgotton.  We made our way down the road to
163 a small establishment where we could talk, while Salsman decided to 
164 chow down.  excessivly.
165     "What about this group, Rab, how far is it?"
166     "about 10 hours trip from here.  We got horses, so we can pack whatever
167 we want." 
168     "I hope that won't be nessesary.  I have a feeling we'd better traval light"

195 Something was wrong with the bola gate. Lights started to flicker on and off
196 all around him. The strain was too much. He passed out in spite of his Ninja
197 training.
198 The Nija started to stir again. He was no longer in the same reality.
199 This one looked vaguely familar. Why, he was in Japan -- outside of the 
200 ninja temple where he was trained. There was something different, however.
201 There seemed to be loud chants of prayer coming from the temple. Something

238 
239 Fortunately, the cognative transmogrification gun was locked 
240 safely away in the hidden vault. Yet without the professor to 
241 complete the recalibration it is useless.

275 Uploading to BWMS: First, change all carriage return/linefeed sequences
276 to carriage return/wait one second. This will allow you to down load in
277 most cases. If you are having problems with dropped chars, or garbled
278 characters during the transmission, you may want to add a wait after
279 sending each character until it is returned to you before sending the 
280 next one. I have been downloading most of my text to BWMS for over two
281 years automatically with COPYLINK which can do all of the above and more.
282 Oh yes, when doing your down load, be sure you go to the bottom before
283 using the ENTER command. This prevents the 2 to 3 second delay that can
284 occur on the first line entery as the disk drive would have to seek
285 a number of tracks to write it on the disk if it isn't on the bottom 
286 already. Since the drives are SA-400's, they take 40ms per track to 
287 seek, that means to go from top to bottom of a full disk it takes 
288 1.6 seconds plus 400MS to find the sector. For a total worse case
289 time of 2 seconds. Conversly, if it is already there, it only takes
290 100MS to seek the new track plus 400MS to find the sector, for a total
291 worse case time of 500MS (or 1/2 second). Speaking of the drives, I
292 am continually amazed that they are still running, considering that
293 they were resurected from dead hulks, and currently sound like a
294 rock crushing machine. I keep expecting them to die any day, yet they
295 still keep on running. Those Shugarts have got to be one of the most
296 reliable drives around I have ever seen. They really need to be given
297 a decent burial, but they keep on working.

305 As I pulled in to the Plaza Hilton, I realized how close I really was to
306 McKane. Now I realize that Oklahoma City is not the most exciting place in
307 the country, but I had a feeling that things would start poppin Real Soon
308 Now. "He must be close...I can feel it in the air."
309 "Park you car sir?", interrupted an attendant...
310 "No thank you, I will park it myself. There are too many tricky things to know
311  to allow someone besides myself to drive it."
312 "A car is a car.", argued the attendant, visibly angered by my response.
313 "This is not a normal car, as you so glibly say. Anyway, why am I arguing
314  with you for..."
315 There is nothing like the sound of spinning tires on blacktop, and this time
316 was no exception. I had things to do and places to go, and I wasn't going to
317 waste my time with the parking attendant.
318 As I entered the hotel, trying to balance a suitcase, a backpack, and a special
319 coding device, I spyed an interesting looking figure. The figure was interesting
320 only because he was so plain looking. This man reminded me of the perfect
321 Bogart character from any of a dozen movies made during the 40's and 50's.
322 I approached the desk, and told the desk person my name.
323 "We have your room all ready sir. My that's an interesting name you have. Where
324  are you from?"
325 "It's a long story, and one I don't feel like retelling now. But maybe later."
326 "Would you like some help with those bags?", she asked, looking at my
327 collection of bags and cases.
328 "No...I'll be fine. Thank you though."
329 I made my way to the elevators, and while I was waiting for any of the half
330 dozen operating at the moment, I noticed that the plain looking man had
331 repositioned himself, now closer to the elevators, and he was occasionally
332 peering from over an old newspaper.
333 Finally the elevator arrived..."Let's see...floor 14...Lucky thing I didn't
334 get floor 13."
335 The doors closed, and I watched the lights as the elevator rose. 1,2,3,4
336 ,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14. "12 to 14!!!", I thought..."Oh I get it...the old
337 13 hex...how cute. I wonder if they do that at all high rise hotels?"
338 The door opened and I stepped out into the hall. Room 1428 was to the left,
339 and I found it quickly, thanks to the guiding signs on the walls. As I 
340 unlocked and opened my door, I immediatly set down my parcels on the floor.
341 But to my surprise as I entered the main part of the room, there sat the
342 plain looking man, and next to him, an arrangement of flowers.
343 "They are from McKane", he said, pointing at the flowers. "He knows you are
344 here, which means he probably knows I am here too. We must be on our guard.
345 I haven't read the note yet, I thought I leave that to you, since they
346 are addressed to 'L'homme sans parity. By the way, before I forget, My
347 name is Joshua, and I am on your side. I am here to help you put an end
348 to the McKane organization once and for all."
349 "How do you know so much about me and what I am doing here", I queried
350 suspiciously.
351 "Do the initials RYRYRY mean anything to you?", he retorted.
352 "OK...so you know about the net, but how can I be sure?"
353 "Let me see that box you set down by the door. I think I can prove who I
354  am to you."
355 Within five minutes, I was convinced. Well now at least I had some help.
356 But now to see what these flowers have to say...
357 &*)#*%)$#*%$# L'homme sans parity aven un ami et comrade *)#*%)@*%)@#%*@)%*@
358 Notice I have changed to the first person. This is to better fit in with

360 interact with the others now.

365    The essence of the piper found himself wafting along above the treetops 
366 surrounding the inn.  The piper had surrendered to the pull that had caused
367 his essence to leave his body -- the so-called "astral travel" that one hears
368 so much about nowadays -- and was waiting to see just what would transpire.
369    After a few long moments 
370 The piper began to quest out in increasing circles, examining the landscape 
371 below him, looking for the source of the call that had brought him.  Logically
372 he should be directly above the source of whatever seemed to be pulling him,
373 but nothing was visible.  "Oh, well," he said to himself, "I may as well see
374 if I really can go underground."  Figuratively taking a breath (you really 
375 needn't breath if you are little more than a vagrant breeze, yourself) the 
376 piper plunged directly downward.  The astral essence of a person is still
377 tenuosly connetcted with our material being.  In astral form you cannot drink
378 a cup of coffee, but can savor the aroma of the steaming cup.  (In point of
379 fact some acquaintances have mentioned that this is by far the best part of
380 that omnipresent brew -- at least as it is most often prepared.)  Thus it took
381 all the piper's courage to plunge into that dank, damp ground of the forest
382 floor.  It was an unpleasant reminder of the cold grave that is in the future
383 of each of the living.  His ethereal essence penetrated the ground slowly.
384 Seeping between the grains of soill, visiting the busy acid factories at te
385 tips of countless plant root hairs, learning secrets and knowlege never ment
386 for the human brain the piper oozed on.  Protracted immersion in an environment
387 inevetably has its effects on the psyche.  As the piper found himself recounting
388 his adventures to a sympathetic group of slugs (really, they are rather charming
389 creatures once you get to know them) he realized that he must continue with
390 his previous quest.  Some time later (for time had long since lost it's meaning)
391 he found himself near a large, glowing, red stone.
392 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
393      Scarlett -- I thought you had somehow left L'Homme's car -- is this true?
394 If indeed, I have found the Rothmann ruby, I should be beneath its notice!

398 Dear McKane:
399 
400 Thank you so much for your "Rent a Miricle" program. I never 
401 would have passed my English lit class without it.
402 
403 When I first heard about your program I never dreamed I could 
404 afford your prices. How lucky for me that you accept 
405 merchandise in trade.
406 
407 I'll deliver Candi, my fifteen year old sister, to the man you 
408 called the pimp. Anyway I think that's what you called him. 
409 By the way Mr. McKane, what is a pimp?
410 
411 Thanks again for getting rid of my two biggest problems, my 
412 F in English lit and my stupid sister. I'll be praying for you 
413 and your good work Mr. McKane. God Bless You.

419 "The move from the McKane Building was a good one.  It will not buy us much
420 time, however.  All I hope is that they will not find out my true nature."
421 "Quit babbling, will you?  I've just got a message that my top scientist has
422 been kidnapped."
423 "What was he doing that was so important?"
424 "Working on an underwater transmortification gun."
425 "Faugh!  And I thought that Earth was at leaset a little civilized.  Playing
426 with those toys?  What need you of them, when there lies power untapped in the
427 Sun itself?"
428 "Well, we use solar energy... I have a chain of Heavy-duty cigarette lighters
429 in the Southwest."
430 "You use just the very outermost shell of the true energy.  Let me demonstrate."
431 Sundownor moves to the side, eyeing a chair in the corner.  Gauging the 
432 intensity of the sun for a moment, he points two fingers at the chair.  A 
433 yellow glow springs from his hand, enveloping the chair.  An instant later,
434 the chair disintergrates, leaving a fine dust to settle to the floor.
435 "If your world had true science, you would know how to do that.  And many more
436 things.  I am again appalled at the primitiveness of this world."
437 McKane was speechless, his jaw having already dropped a ways.  "Can...can...
438 you build something that will do that?"
439 "Yes....."

449  To troubled person,
450    to het those pesky UFO's out of your life I suggest that you send~
451    at least a thousand or so volts of electricity through your body.
452    That should hold them off for a while, and if that doesn't work,
453    eat a gallon of Bresler ice cream an hour. They should be gone
454    within the week.

506 JC AND THE BOYS: I WONT MISS YOU A BIT
507 ARE YOU ALL A BUNCE OF CRAZY INSANE PEOPLE. WHAT IS THIS SYSTEM
508 Person directly above, why don't you join the big J.C. You two seem to be in
509 the same class of humanoid subcreatures.
510 BBOORRIINNGG this system is, every one talking about them selves and
511 what group or party they are in, are not bulletin boards set up for the
512 princeple of comunication. It seems that one group is comming down on
513 another group and so on. Can't everyone on this system take everyone
514 else f~or what they are, not what you want them to be. This would be
515 an enjoyable system to log onto if it were'nt for all these contrasts
516 of personalities. I used to be a steady member of this board (called
517 regulary a week) but now it seems to be run over by this group who
518 call them selves 'networks', 'juvie hunters', 'porfis' or whatever
519 it may be, havegiven this system a bad, even horrible name. I wouldn't
520 be on now but I'm so didsturbed by these groups, and what they are doing.
521 And what of these names, 'the man in gray', 'the ninja',and all those
522 others, why can't you show your real name, got something to hide or is
523 it because if those peopl knew your real name they would stop talking
524 to you alltogether. 
525 HEY, all juvie hunters, why don't you tell us your real names. Juvies
526 are so dumb and stupid, they won't know what to do with them RIGHT?
527 so why not. Be a couple of real studs that you pretend to be by telling
528 me, or is that to difficult to do? if not, great. Well, I still havn't
529 said enough but I must be going.               
530                                                Mark Forsyth.
531 
532   ~ ok, Now that we have all of your attentionMaybe I can have a word with someone
533 Or maybe not at all, thats the usuall pollicy here isn't it.
534                                OK, you groups can think that you control

535                                    but that control is always based on the lower 


536 PLUS, what are all those stories about, don't you have anything better to do?
537 I know I don't.
538 This system will never improve, its now stuck with those network creeps

541 Yes, let's all conform! Death to creativity! No more stories.
542 Let's only talk about computers and IC's and bits and bytes

556 Hmm, the last time didn't seem to get Pam to show, so I wonder
557 what I can say to get her to leave something? Is it because
558 there is too much space here that you feel obligated to fill and
559 can't think of enough to fill it? Are you mad at us all, and don't
560 want to talk to us again? Maybe your just fed up with all the 
561 bickering going on and waiting for a better time to return? Or
562 possibly (heaven forbid) you are just tired of BWMS and have moved
563 on to other more interesting things? Come back Pam, Please?

600 Frankly, all of this fantasy on here is boring drivel.  There does exist
601 writing in fantasy that is original, thought-provoking, and creative.  I
602 have seen none on this bbs that answers to any of those adjectives.  Let's
603 get out of this stupid rut.  P-L-E-A-S-E!!!!!!
604 {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} Analog Alan {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} July 3 {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}
605 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
606 One called Spock:  First off, I want to say that I respect your opinions.
607 Secondly, when I wrote that PART of the 'Heroes' essay, I was writing it in
608 a speculative kind of way.  The part about the Empire being a "lawfully 
609 constituted government" is in actuallity a true statement.  When you 
610 talk about government, isn't it the government that says what is lawful of not
611 ?????  Yes, it does.  So, by that revelation, the statement is true.  If you
612 were on the Rebellion's side, (Which I am!!!) then it would not be true.  You
613 see, as guoted from Return of the Jedi, 'It all depends on your point of view.'
614 TIn regards to the 'Trouble with Tribbles' episode...When the Tribbles got 
615 around the Klingons they became violent.  And I was talking about the 
616 Federation in general, not the actions of just one individual.
617 To the Unnamed One:  I thank you for the compliment.  I do have about 4 or 5
618 more enries on the subject of heroes.  There is a part of it that is on
619 villans, too!!!  Please reveal your name to me.
620 THERE IS MORE TO COME ON THE SUBJECT OF HEROES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
