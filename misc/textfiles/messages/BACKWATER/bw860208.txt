30    Rejek's son Exis was about Tariya's age but lame in one leg, requiring him to wear a brace. This was the only thing
31 that saved him from military conscription. Despite his handicap, he was a first-class mechanic and had beefed up his
32 T-47 far beyond original factory specs. He was also quite handsome. James kept glancing at Tariya nervously but she
33 showed little interest in Exis. In fact, she didn't have much interest in anything. Her eyes were hollow and empty.
34 Her whole world was falling apart and there was nothing she could do.
35    James tried to sound reassuring. "Don't worry. There's got to be some way out of this. We'll find it." She smiled
36 at him gratefully. She had never seen him despair or give up regardless of the situation. His strength went a long
37 ways towards bolstering hers. More and more she found herself attracted to him. When this was all over, one way or
38 another, she would tell him exactly how she felt.
39    She would have felt considerably different had she known what had been discussed in that room after she left. James
40 had agreed, of course, because that was the only way he could get a free ride. What the asked for, and what they were
41 going to get weren't necessarily the same thing, however.
42    Finally they were bundled in the T-47 and the small aircraft took off with a roar. Exis leveled off at seven
43 thousand feet and set a course for Shaikhur.
44    Forty minutes later he pointed down. "The warzone."
45    There was a haze from hundreds of small fires. A huge black streak had been cut across the land. Even from this
46 altitude the desolation was apparent. Forests had been burned, whole villages reduced to rubble. No fighting was
47 visible, just the afteraffects. Tariya stared down out the window, a single tear rolling down her cheek.
48    Exis pulled into a dive. "Need to avoid their scanners." James said nothing as he took them for a two hundred knot
49 roller coaster ride, hugging the terrain as close as he could. James had to admit, he was every bit as good as Rejek
50 said.
51    Sometimes good wasn't enough. James glanced back through the transparent canopy and saw five small spots in the
52 distance, closing fast. "Damn! We got company!"
53    Exis looked back and swore. He brought the ship down lower until the trees whipped by beneath them terrifyingly
54 fast and close. The fighters closed inexhorably. Finally they were close enough James could make out their insignia,
55 though he didn't recognize it. There were flashes of light from the nose of the foremost fighter and suddenly the ship
56 shuddered. Exis yelled, "We've been hit!"
57    The fighter let off a second burst and the canopy shattered. The scream of the wind drowned out the screams of the
58 passengers. Exis didn't scream, and James saw why. He was slumped forward, a large, bloody bullethole in the center of
59 his back. The nose suddenly aimed at the ground.
60    James pushed the body back and grabbed the stick. Why the hell couldn't this thing had been a Skymaster? He hadn't
61 the slightest idea how to fly a T-47. He pulled back on the yoke and brought the nose to the horizon. A cliff rushed
62 headlong towards them. He yanked the control back and they barely cleared it. Tariya was screaming something but he
63 ignored her.
64    There was water ahead, a lake or something. This was probably his best chance. He lowered the plane to the surface
65 and cut the power. The ship skipped once, twice, three times, smashing up huge rooster tails and jolting the occupants
66 painfully. The far shore was coming up fast. Way too fast.
67    The fighters shot overhead barely fifty feet above them. The ship smacked the water one last time and then they
68 were sailing over land again. They could only watch in horror as the ground rose up to meet them...

129 (Bard ... after all I DID leave the opening...)
130   The piper, although he gravitated towards low-technology realities, was
131 sufficiently familiar with the bard to be unsurprised at the sudden appearance
132 of his old friend.  A glance through the slightly milky plastic of the rescue
133 bag assured him that the bard had retrieved his bagpipes, so the piper relaxed
134 for the trip back to the bard's vehicle.  The opacity of the atmosphere and
135 the milkiness of the plastic kept him from a view of the bard's transportation
136 as the lock opened.  A few moments later, stripping the shards of plastic
137 from the burst rescue bubble, the piper listened to the bard's explanation.
138   "Well, that explains my continued existence," the piper said slowly after
139 the bard had finished.  "Now I suppose you'd like to know how I got into this
140 fix in the first place?"
141   At the bard's amused nod, the piper related how the inkeeper had disappeared
142 and he had hastened to follow the innkeeper.  At the end of the tale, the
143 piper concluded sadly, "if he hasn't had some equally fortuitous circumstance,
144 he's probably pickled by now.  I
145 would really rather try to rescue a living being than have to brave some of
146 the realities in which resurrection is possible..."

151 Just because I like to blow up things and kill bad guys does not mean I have
152 no sensitivity... [*=*] DELTA FIVE [*=*]
153 THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS A DOUBLE NEGATIVE.
154 NEVER USE A SENTENCE THAT HAS TWO NEGATIVES SUCH AS:
155 DOES *NOT* MEAN I HAVE *NO* SENSITIVITY.  IT ONLY SERVES TO CONFUSE THE READER.
156 ALL CRITICISM ASIDE, IT WAS A GOOD POEM.
157 
158 To Above critic:
159   Would you not object if I didn't say that you're not a bad critic?
160 
161 Good point!
162 I would not object if you did not say anything not related to whether or not
163 I did or did not employ double negatives. I do not think it does not matter
164 I just do not care. Confusion, like beauty lies with the beholder...
165 But what if the Beholder is blind? Does he still not see? Cut him, and does
166 he still not bleed? Throw cream pies in his face, and does he not laugh? If
167 the beholder of this great beauty lies in conditions of confusion, than he
168 too is not beholden to anyone or anything. I say this with a clear mind and
169 a clean conscience, because we are all beholders in one form or another, and
170 therefor we are all able to speak as an expert on the subject...
171 
172 MY FRIEND, I BELIEVE YOU'RE ON DRUGS.  AND I DON'T THINK YOUR MIND COULD BE
173 ANY FOGGIER.  2ND POINT: IF THE BEHOLDER IS BLIND AND WHAT HE MUST BEHOLD
174 REQUIRES SIGHT, THEN THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN BEHOLD THE DARN THING!
175 3RD POINT:  YOU'RE QUESTIONS LOOK LIKE REAL QUESTIONS-EVEN PROFOUND QUESTIONS-
176 BUT ARE ULTIMATELY UNANSWERABLE BECAUSE THEY ARE BASED ON SOME HIDDEN PIECE
177 OF NONSENSE.
178 FROM NOW ON I THINK I'LL KEEP MY BIG MOUTH SHUT, FOR EVEN THE CRITICS ARE
179 CRITICIZED.

204         "Show me an illusion!" the hag demanded.
205         Miranda was scared.  She didn't know what the hag would want to
206 see, and she didn't know how the hag knew of her magical abilities.  She
207 felt as if she was on trial.  Her earlier self-confidence was gone,
208 replaced by an extreme fear of the ancient gypsy before her.  In the
209 background she heard the violin playing, a dance of joy, a celebration
210 of love between a mother and her son, between a father and his wife,
211 between the gypsies and mother earth -- between the earth and stars. 
212 The music penetrated Miranda's soul, and she was able to fight back her
213 fear and think of her magic.
214         All those books that she read, and the only illusion that came
215 to mind was the flame she had used to alert the authorities of the
216 slavers.  The torch next to them flickered, and she began to
217 concentrate.  In her mind, she visualized a larger version of the torch
218 just above the first.  As she put more energy into it, the ground around
219 the pair began to light up in a sharp luminescense.  The shadows became
220 much wilder, wavering back and forth, varying with the energy Miranda
221 put into the illusion.
222         "Fool!" the hag cried.  "Do you want to attract everyone
223 around?"  She outstretched her hand.  "Compress it into a small ball and
224 place it here, without burning me, mind you."
225         Miranda carefully shrunk the ball of fire to a sphere the size
226 of her own fist.  Slowly, taking her time, she brought it down from over
227 the torch and placed it just over the hag's hand.  As it trembled there,
228 the hag smiled.  Miranda passed the first test.
229         Suddenly the hag waved her hand and the ball was gone.  Miranda
230 felt a sharp pain behind her eyes as her illusion was wrenched away by a
231 force many times stronger.  She looked at the hag.
232         "Lift me!" the hag demanded.
233         Miranda complied with little effort.  Of all her abilities,
234 Miranda found levitation the easiest.  The hag now sat three feet in the
235 air.
236         "Higher!"
237         As Miranda started to lift the hag higher, she felt a resistance
238 to her efforts.  It wasn't from inside her, but outside.  Miranda looked
239 up at the hag and realized that this was her second test: a proof of
240 strength.  The hag was providing a barrier for Miranda to push against. 
241 Miranda gritted her teeth and pushed harder.  Harder.  With each push of
242 energy, Miranda felt the resistance redouble.  The weight of the barrier
243 increased, and Miranda struggled as hard as she could... and more.
244         "Enough!" cried the hag, and the resistance eased off.  Miranda
245 set the hag down.  They sat and regarded each other.  The light of the
246 torch played off of the hag's face, outlining the nose, reflecting in
247 her eye.  That bright red eye!  "That's odd," thought Miranda.  She
248 hadn't noticed it before, but the hag's right eye had a deep red cast to
249 it.
250         "You have power, young pup, but you know little.  I shall teach
251 you."
252 
253         The violin music in the background continued, seeping from under
254 and around the wagon behind Miranda.  The sound of the violin slipped
255 into Miranda's mind, softening the fear, relaxing her body.  The tests
256 were over, for now at least.  Miranda had passed, and now she was going
257 to learn.  When she had left her father's, she thought she had the
258 knowledge she needed to find the fourth book of transformations, but now
259 she realized that knowing the spells is not enough.  She must also know
260 how to use them.
261         Tired, Miranda was led to a bedroll.  She was glad to be with
262 these people, even though she yet didn't know them.  She only knew the
263 hag, an ugly, scary old woman.  But there was a warmth.  It came from
264 the campfire, from the wagon, from the family.  And it came from the
265 violin. A gypsy violin, it is said, can make the stones cry or make the
266 stars sing.  Tonight, it comforted a young woman.

290 Greeting my friends,
291       Welcome to the Hall of life, formaly  known as the RC.  I'd like to
292 take you on a journey with me.  I stand before the machine in the center
293 of the hall and take a "escape".  Ive been thinking of the "pursuit" of
294 goals recently and so I think maybe "pursuit" would be a good door to try.
295       The door to "pursuit" opens slowing to reveal a beautiful forset,
296 complete with paths, sunlight filtering thru the trees.  A large white
297 rabbit with pink eyes sits about 7 feet in front of me.  He is looking right
298 at me, and yet he doesn't move a bit.  I do admit to being a coward at
299 
times, but how could I resist this plump, fuzzy animal?  "I think I'll call
300 him "parkway" cause he's kinda parked along the way.  A new pet, ok
301 here goes,  I take a slow step forward, Parkway eying me, takes a casual
302 hop away from me.  Great, no progress, unable to be patient I took off
303 after Parkway, The forest ground away from the pathes is covered with a
304 think blackberry type vines.  These vines although brocken down from the
305 harsh winter, are difficult to manuver thru.  Of course, Parkway knew just
306 where to lead me.  I tripped on a think vine and fell face-forward into
307 the bramble.  As I disentagle myself from the vines, I see that Parkway
308 has moved back towards the path.  Bleeding from deep scratches I paused
309 to treat my wounds, as I was spraying on the "bandaid" another hiker
310 chanced along.  Parkway looked back at me before hopping down closer to
311 the new hiker.  Parkway paused,  The hiker paused, The hiker took a step
312 closer,  Parkway took a hop back.  I watched with a smile on my face
313 as the hiker ran after Parkway back into the vines, and fell.

347 me, when you had no reasonable way of knowing where I was. Try to be technically
348 accurate. Don't come up with ball point pen lasers that shoot down satellites

355 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
356      Bard was digging out gear for Piper from the lockers in the sleeping 
357 area of the conveyer. Piper was seated in the co-pilot seat and had 
358 swiveled it so he could continue his tale of just how he'd gotten into this
359 fix.
360      Bard re-secured the all the unneeded equipment and checked behind 
361 various access panels in the deck, overhead, and in the rear bulkhead. 
362 Closing them he went forward the pilot seat as Piper finished.
363      He powered up the lift-and-drive, and with a muted hum the conveyer 
364 lifted from the ground. They were off for the locus of the first transition
365 registered by flux sensors. It could only be hoped that when they arrived 
366 it would not be to find a body.
367       The conveyor hummed along a meter or two above the ground. The yellow
368 fog that passed for air locally restricted visibility to a few hundred 
369 meters so while Bard watched the instruments, Piper peered through the 
370 windscreen.
371       A light flashed on the panel. Another arrival?  Well whoever it was 
372 would have to take their chances. There'd be time for them after the 
373 Innkeeper had been located. And they'd arrived fairly close to the 
374 Innkeeper's probable location anyway....
375      Their destination should just over the next rise. Bard looked up.
376      "See anything yet? I'm getting some odd readings that might be someone
377 using some sort of protection spell"
378 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
379 Are we all alone in this? If you're looking for an opening......
380 (yes, you *too* Milchar!)

383    As the mage known as Milchar vanished in a manner similar to the Innneeper,
384 the prevalent need for communication left Cragmore's mind. It had to be
385 Milchar! thought Cragmore to himself. I must talk to him.
386    Silently, Cragmore stepped up to the location where Milchar has last been
387 a part of the Inn's reality, and sat down on the floor next to the fireplace.
388 He carefully crossed his legs, and placed in hands on his knees, and leaned
389 back until his back was straight against the stone-made hearth. In most
390 places, such a sight would cause great commotion. People simply do not sit
391 on the floor of public places in such a manner. But this was the Inn, and
392 being a wonderful and mystical place, no one takes much notice of such
393 odd goings-on.
394     Cragmore knew he had to follow Milchar's mental trail. Luckily powerful
395 mages such as Milchar emit strong psi emanations, and if they are not aware
396 that they are being trailed, the remnants of these emanations are easy to
397 follow.
398     The relaxed look on Cragmore's face belied the great concentration that
399 Cragmore was currently involved in. Slowly, Cragmore felt the boundary's of
400 reality begin to separate, just a bit, but enough to allow him to pass
401 from on to another. Milchar's trail was smooth and continuous between the
402 different bands, and in the wink of an eye, Cragmore disappeared from the
403 reality of the Inn, and made his way, along the trail, to another reality
404 in which he knew nothing about. His only guidance being the psi trail,
405 and the over-riding knowledge that he must talk to Milchar.
406     Life goes on at the Inn. Whether patrons use the front door or the
407 back door or no door is of no concern to anyone but the person leaving.
408                                    CRAGMORE

443 If someone were too busy to write, that would be homelurk.
444 Two people leaving 'sweet nothing' borders would be'flirking'
445 Single men who leave borders are 'batchlurks'.
446 If two people met thru' Backwater, and got married, that would be 'lurkimony'
447 People who don't leave anything have (you got it) 'lurkophobia'
448 If (in all allowed) someone crashes another's border, we have 'lurkicide'.
449 When twits invade Backwater, we have a 'twitalerk'.
450 When someone calls in from their place of employment, that is, of course 'worklurk'.

479 It is a delicate thing, these spy-writing sensations.  If you decide that
480 being an operative is your thing to do, that is quite alright.  There's
481 only one thing to watch out for...  "The Others."  Yes, the others are at
482 it where you may least expect it.  Pro or Con, it's not a pretty sight
483 when you run into one; even worse is it if you've caused on reason to be-
484 come irritated with you.  (You might find that the age old habit you've
485 had of breathing will be one you may soon drop.)
486 Enter, if you so choose, into the stories that are running here; or start
487 up one of your own.  (Sometimes the latter is much more desirable.)
488 A small tip for those that decide to jump into that particular realm...
489 Just about all the spies you see here (if you do) are veterans, and have
490 in some fashion designed their own ground rules.  To just thrust your
491 character INTO their storyline is risky, and at times lethal.
492 But by all means, don't let this stop you (completely).  These are merely
493 a few words to the wise						L.C.

498   Peering through the glass and into the murk, the piper strained his eyes to
499 make out the forms lurking in the yellow-green mists.  In reply to the bard's
500 query, he started to reply, "Not ..." then interrupted with a cough.  
501 "... yet," he continued, then began coughing again.
502   Coughing is a survival reflex.  Our bodies cough to clear obstructions from
503 our airways.  We can partially, but not wholly override it.
504   The piper tried.  An occasional cough can bring relief of a half-felt 
505 irritation.  A too-frequent cough can bring pain and an irritated throat.
506 However, some coughs seem to come from the absolute core of a person, build
507 up in intensity, and erupt with uncontrollable violence.  A series of such
508 coughs burst from the piper, coughs of such size that their deep, rattling
509 sound alarmed him nearly as much as the searing pain that shot through his
510 chest.
511   "Bard, I ..."
512   The piper doubled over trying to hold the cough in, cupping his mouth with
513 both hands.  The violence of the cough pushed through his hands, coating 
514 them with a very bright red spray of blood.  Shocked, the piper held his
515 hands up before his face, listening to the gurgle and bubble as he tried
516 to draw a breath.

534 DELTA FIVE: Are we ever going to see you again?
535 <<:*********************************************************:>>
536 DELTA FIVE - Mr. McKane is, indeed, out there somewhere. It is 
537 rumored that Mr. McKane has retired from public affairs. He 
538 and Frank Jones have started a home for sexually precosious  
539 pre-pubescent boys in a remote location in Uruguay.
540 
541 Frank is to be the sex therapist, LeRoy the financial manager. 
542 They expect to make a great deal of money.
543 
544 The Grand Dragon Master considered putting the McKane Empire 
545 back into action. He decided against it because he was afraid 
546 it would lapse into spy stuff. He seems to have had enough of 
547 the cloak and dagger.
548 
549 Grand D's computer has been down so he hasn't been around much 
550 for the past few months. It seems to be on the mend and he'll 
551 probably show up when it's not ENTER ONLY. He hates ENTER ONLY.
552 
553 I thought I'd mention I've read some of your writing from time 
554 to time. Some of it is really good. I think you're definitely 
555 one of the better writers. 
556
