27   Here is the dictionary's term for the word "theory":
28 
29 the.o.ry //the-e-re, thi(-e)r-e/ n [LL theora[
30 1: the analysis of a set of facts in their relation to one
31 another 2: the general or absract principles of a body of fact,
32 a science, or an art
33 
34   Now, all you guys arguing about what "theory" really means,
35 there is a defenition if I ever heard one.

40 acoustic coupled modem to call the computer, but the baud rate on the
41 screen had to be at least 1200 baud from the speed of the update.
42      You'd think that a movie whose centerpiece was a computer

44 such things.

83 Tron: the dictionary definition of a word doesn't always match
84 the actual usage. My dictionary lists several definitions two
85 of which apply to the current discussion:
86 1. a coherent group of general propositions used as principles
87 of explanation for a class of phenomena: Newton's theory of
88 gravitation.
89 2. a proposed explanation whose status is still conjectural, in
90 contrast to well-established propositions that are regarded as
91 reporting matters of actual fact.
92 3. Math. a body of principles, theorems, or the like, belonging
93 to one subject: number theory.
94 4. the branch of a science or art which deals with its prin-
95 ciples or methods, as distinguished from its practice: music
96 theory.
97 5. a particular conception or view of something to be done or
98 the method of doing it; a system of rules or principles.
99 6. a contemplation or speculation.
100 7. guess or conjecture.
101 
102 I don't think that defs #3 & #4 apply to the discussion, but I
103 think EVERY ONE of th other FIVE have been used so far.
104 Scientists generally use def #1, they would consider def #2 to
105 be a definition (a poor one) of hypothesis. The general public
106 tends to think that a def #6 means theory & def #7 means 
107 hypothesis. No wonder we can't understand each other! PLEASE
108 when discussing scientific theories remember that def #1 is
109 the proper definition!
110     I just noticed a footnote in the dictionary:
111 THEORY, HYPOTHESIS are both often used colloquially to mean an
112 untested idea or opinion. A THEORY properly is a more or less
113 verified or established explanation accounting for known facts
114 or phenomena: the theory of relativity. A HYPOTHESIS is a con-
115 jecture put forth as a possible explanation of certain
116 phenomena or relations, which serves as a basis of argument or
117 experimentation by which to reach the truth: This idea is
118 offered only as a hypothesis.
119     I think this footnote covers things QUITE well!

121    THERE ARE indeed modems running at 1200 bps (full duplex),
122 that have acoustic couplers.  Vadic and TI (among others) have

124 Vadic 3400 format.  There is one 212 acoustic modem made by
125 Anderson-Jacobson.  I haven't seen one work, just advertised.

177 To: People who have seen War Games  From: Tron  Re: War Games
178 
179    Despite all of what you guys think, I thought War Games was
180 a good movie. It had a good plot. Who cares if it has technical
181 errors in it? It's main objective it to entertain. It sure
182 entertained me. Go see it! It's a good movie!
183 
184            Tron
185 ----------
186 I can't agree with your assessment of Wargames.  While entertaining, the
187 inconsistencies and inaccuracies were very annoying to me.  You can obviously
188 ignore them, which is why you liked the movie.
189     1.  A so-called spy would not be admitted to NORAD.
190     2.  You can't just run into NORAD by driving a jeep through the
191         fences and expect to be let in like a guest, especially if it
192         is being sealed up for war.
193     3.  It is highly unlikely that WOPR would be capable of finding the
194         kid's phone number and dialling it to return the call:  It would
195         be unusually well isolated from the phone system to prevent any
196         unauthorized access.
197 
198 It is unfortunate that non-technical people (as well as people who think
199 they are technically oriented but aren't) will interpret this movie as a
200 statement of the vulnerability of the defense system.  That's precisely
201 what some of them are looking for.

236 My dearest Amazon, I did not intend to be insulting in my remarks to both
237 the halves of the Human race.  True enough, every earthbound species has
238 both counterparts with the exception of some plants and lower developed
239 creatures.
240    My remarks to the "fairer sex" were simply my scholorly side slipping 
241 through. I apologize for the insult.  It was not intended.
242    Note that I put "fairer sex" in quotes.  I wish to explain lest you 
243 misunderstand my intent.  The women of our race are clearly the mental 
244 supirior of men.  Although men are clearly the physical supirior (I'm 
245 speaking in general terms.  There are ALWAYS exceptions). 
246    One cannot get along without the other.  A man or woman alone is an
247 incomplete being. For reasons other than the obvious of lack of 
248 the ability to reproduce, the human race would die out of both sexes did 
249 not exist.
250    I hope I have made my thoughts a bit clearer.
251       Akonis
252 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
253 Akonis, re-read your own comments and tell me if you think they are any
254 clearer or if they clarify prior "thoughts".  I might think a bit more
255 of you if you'd preface your unending generalities with "I think", "I
256 have seen", or "I might suggest".  Tell a man or a woman who chooses to
257 be alone that he or she is an incomplete being!  And I am NOT either
258 "yours" or "dearest", which I infer is another insult to the independence
259 of a, and any, female human.  In short, Akonis: I challenge you to see...
260 really see... what hidden attitudes lie within you that detract from the
261 sanctity of others and from your own personal worth because of that.

269      Thank you EXWARIOR for defending my opinion. The jeep
270 smashing through the gates is realistic. You must note that they
271 went to DEFCON 1 and were closing the doors. Everone went inside.
272 They ran and just made it. And, how do you know this sort of
273 movie wasn't targeted to the near future? I could have been the
274 year 2000 for all we know! Well, anyway, it was a good movie for
275 it's plot and it kept the action coming. WOPR could have had a
276 phone tracer on it! If phone companies could do it, who says that
277 WOPR couldn't? TRON (the movie, not me) was just as outlandish
278 as this was. Who ever heard of 100% artificial inteligence? Master
279 Control Program did it fine. If you are going to put down War
280 Games, you might as well put down TRON (not me) too.

288 IT IS NOT ALL THAT GOOD! DURING A THREE YEAR PERIOD THAT I WAS SERVICING
289 AIRCRAFT WITH NUCULAR ARMAMENT. THERE WAS A MAJOR SECURITY VIOLATION
290 ON AN AVERAGE OF EVERY 6 MONTHS. A MAJOR SECURITY VIOLATION BEING
291 SOMEONE ON SITE THAT NOT ONLY DID NOT BELONG THERE BUT ALSO HAD NO

307 Amazon,
308    It is difficult for me to clarify that which is inherently murky. 
309 Especially using such limited, slow communications as this.  I shall try 
310 though.
311    When I said "incomplete", I did not mean that as a description of 
312 worth, or anything of the like.  Every human needs to be alone, and each 
313 for different amounts of time.  I myself have been known to go on lone 
314 trips for months at a time, without contacting a soul.  I need this to
315 recollect my thoughts, to do odd things, and just to be alone for the
316 sake of itself.  This does not make me incomplete.
317    Nor did I intend to say that if you do not have a lover, partner, wife,
318 or whatever you wish to call it, you are incomplete.  That is simply not 
319 so.  A person's validity (or completeness) as a human being does not
320 depend on the number of emotional ties one might have.
321    What I DID intend to say is that the qualities of males and females 
322 MESH.  One downfalls is covered by the other's strengths.  That as HUMANS,
323 we are stronger united.  Males and females (I use the scientific terms
324 intentionally) NEED each other to exist, for the above stated reason.
325    This has been proven to be true in all of myy observations and studies 
326 of humankind.
327    I believe you are mistaking my use of 'Completeness' to mean 
328 'Validity', 'Worth', or the like.  I do not associate the two.

338      Excuse me, Proud:  you've made some valid points, but must you be
339 so stingingly prejudiced??  Your voice seems designed to antagonize, and
340 it's tone is bitter, angry...you did not even acknowledge an honest
341 apology, nor give Akonis credit for the warmth in his address.  Do you
342 realize you may be reinforcing the stereotypical woman in these men's
343 minds--that of an emotionally-charged, highly unreasonable individual,
344 as Billy Joel sings:  "She'll never give in and she'll never give out...
345 she just changes her mind"?  As I have not as yet made your acquaintance,

350 accusations!  You display a measure of intelligence.  Try directing it to
351 more positive uses than perpetrating unfriendly battle!
352      As for the words that inspired this fiery rage, I have to laugh:
353 these are but speculations as to why there are so few females in the
354 field--and the ideas are sorry, at that!  "Macho conspiracy"?  Come,

366     I regret to inform you that the phrase "My dearest ...."
367 does NOT necessarily imply anything other than friendship! For
368 example, Sherlock Holmes addressed Watson as "My dear Watson"
369 Am I to assume that there were sexual overtones in this comment?
370 Please don't say that Holmes was being condescending either, in
371 context the phrase is obviously derived from "dear friend". Note
372 that "dear" in this sense means VALUED!
373     I assume that you made an honest mistake, but I caution
374 you to check more carefully, before criticizing someone's usages.
375 Otherwise you run the risk of be classed with the "fanatic" 
376 fringe of the feminist movement (i.e. the people who want ALL
377 occurences of "man" in a phrase or word replaced by "person",
378 regardless of whether or not it was derived from "man-male human"
379 or "man...-from Latin manus-hand") I have run into people who
380 actually thought "manual", as in manual labor, was a sexist term!
381 I do hope that you merely forgot to consider what was MEANT, as
382 opposed to what SEEMED to be being said. We are ALL guilty of that
383 at times!

402 was running for cover and didn't care who went in or who came
403 out. Their main objective was to SURVIVE! By the was, there

427 That's STUPID Tron, you admit that!  When you catch a bank robber, you
428 don't lock him up in the bank vault, he goes to jail.  Cmon, now,
429 there is no good reason why he had to be taken to: the most sensitive
430 area on earth.
431     Yet another error:  The FBI couldn't have known WHO in the 
432 household actually did the calling.  Why didn't they pick up the
433 father or mother instead (or in addition!).
434 
435     The fact is, a lot of the story was contrived and it shows.
436 Ignore this, and you will consider the story good.   Recognize this,
437 and you will have second thoughts, to say the least.
438 ----------
439 Some cases must be delt with with the peoples involved.
440     YES THEY COULD HAVE KNOWN! Remember, he reserved a flight
441 to Paris on an airplane and they checked? They probably checked
442 in the phone book for David (whatshisface) and couldn't find it.
443 He also probably checked at that number also. And that is not
444 stupid. If a kid broke into my house (the equivalent of the
445 above) I'd bitch him out before turning him over to the police.
446 Think about it......

450 P.S. Don't be so inslutive. Calling someones' idea or opinion
451 stupid isn't smart.

472    My thanks to you, d.  Perhaps I was wrong in saying I no longer fight.  
473 There are always those who will fight over anything they can.
474    Tron,  in commenting on the technical errors in War Games, I was not 
475 makino an opinion on the quality of the story.  I feel they pulled it off 
476 badly, but the storyline was a good idea.

481      O Innkeeper, your most precious parcel met my hands today; I'll be
482 poring over it in ecstasy before many hours have passed--Thank you, sire:
483 the labour of my soul will soon be yours, as well!
484      The Inn is busy as dusk falls:  husky voices blend into a pleasant
485 roar, some tangled in lively debate, others jovially laughing over ale,
486 a few deep and sombre in their discussions.  A slight figure rests quietly
487 among them, dark eyes intent, head tilted inquisitively, as she listens
488 with peaceful enjoyment.  Her roving eyes light upon the Innkeeper, as
489 he surveys his establishment, and she waits, smile curling expectantly,
490 until he feels the gaze upon him.  A hearty grin rewards her patience,
491 with a flourished, mock bow to enchance his greeting; she, still watching,
492 returns a joyous peal of laughter...Warmth from earlier sunshine lingers
493 for an utterly pleasant evening, allowing the shutters to be open, and they
494 ply a cooling breeze from the entrance, whose heavy doors solemnly frame a
495 fabric of silhouetted trees, delicately touched with pinpricks of light.
496 Gently, teasingly, the whisper of a wind nudges a lock of hair into the
497 lady's face; she unconsciously brushes it back into place, oblivious to
498 all but the conversations around.  But the breeze persists, tickling her
499 cheek again and again, until finally she glances around to find it's source.
500 "Ahh..." she murmers, entranched by the sight of the stars, and before she
501 knows it, she is on her feet, weaving her way through the crowd.  There,
502 she stands in the entrance, one hand hesitating on the rough-hewn beam,
503 hair tumbling, unnoticed...a leaf skitters in from the night, unhindered.
