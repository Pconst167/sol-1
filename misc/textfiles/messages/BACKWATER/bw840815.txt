66 Ted,
67         One of the many posible reasons for no discussion of your --Budget--
68 is that it is most difficult to be objective about expenses when one has not 
69 been presented with any sources of revenue....Secondly accurate addition plays
70 suprisingly major role in any discussion of fiscal policies. In your example
71 their exists a mear 9.6 billion dollar difference between the stated total and
72 the sum of the column. I know thats picky but it shows a lack of research..
73 and a presentation of the facts as they exist. Furthemore I know of no
74 preordained economic disaster due in 85...could you perhaps illustrate the 
75 chain of events for those of us not predesposed to clairvoyance ?
76 As for your contention of interest rate controls being currently in place 
77 I know of no such act that either the Federal Reserve or Comptroller of the
78 Currency has placed into effect. The rates as they exist now are simply a 
79 function of the market.

83 --=--==--===--====--=====--======--=======--========--=========--==========
84 Hi All,     Tuck here.  Have you ever tried to type messages while eating
85 toast with marmalade (that's the way ukershucerskersmckers spells it.)
86 jelly and drinking an ice cream float?  Pretty tough, isn't it?  The slowest
87 part of the process has to be making the things.  If you can make um fast
88 enough, then you can eat um before the system isn't busy, see?  Let's 
89 concentrate on getting the jelly onto the bread, since this seems to be the
90 most mechanical process, thus having the greatest chace for loss of time
91 due to friction (i.e. dropping the jar, letting the lid roll under the 
92 refrigerator, siblings yelling at you for sticking her shoe to the floor,
93 ect.)
94      The tool used to transfer the jelly to the bread should be concidered
95 on three major points.
96 1. Ability to remove the jelly from the container.
97 2. Ability to transport the jelly from the container to the toast.
98 3. Ability to spread the jelly evenly on the toast.
99      Bonus credit should also be given for additional uses, such as;
100 A) Heater for warming jelly to the temperature of the toast.
101 B) Handi-Wipe dispenser for sticky hands.
102 cC) Ultrasonic device to ward off flies.
103 D) Being edible, makes for easy clean-up.
104     Most present utensils (i.e. jelly-handling tools) seem built for some
105 other unknown purposes.  The spoon scores a 9.5 on removal and transport,
106 but rates a 2 on spreading.  The knife gets a 3.5 on removal, 3 on transport,
107 and comes back strong with 9.5 in speading.  The fork get 3's accros the board.
108 The La Machine comes out with 9.95 in removal and two -1.2 in transport
109 and spreading.  It also tends to eat bottles and such.  Clearly, there is
110 no real tool designed for jelly to toast tranfers.
111      Now all we have to do is modify, combine, or just create some new
112 utensils to facilitate jelly tranfers.  I will put out a few of my ideas,
113 and leave the rest to you.
114 .Using a caulking gun with suction action to squirt jelly
115 .A pully and string to tip a jar of jelly on the ceiling onto a piece
116  of toast below
117 .Trained hamsters with backscoops and troweled feet
118 .The good old Use-your-tounge method
119      Special Point:  No, Lord Morbe, you can not use your scarf to adequatly
120 accomidate a jelly to toast transfer.
121      Get rowdy and type those replies...

126 WELL, I HAD A FEELING THAT SOMEONE WOULD QUIBBLE ABOUT THOSE FIGURES. ALEX, I GOT THOSE FIGURES FROM A HANDOUT THAT I GOT BACK
127 IN GOVERNMENT CLASS. THE FIGURES UNDOUBTEDLY DO NOT ADD RIGHT, CONSIDERING THAT I HAD LOGGED ON AS 3:00 AM. I AM NOT REALLY 
128 INTERESTED IN THE BUDGET EITHER, BUT I HOPED THAT THOSE WHO WERE ARGUEING OVER IT COULD LOOK AT MY TALLY. SOME OF THE THINGS 
129 THAT I SAW ON THE BOARD REGARDING THE BUDGET WERE ABSOLUTLY OUTRAGEOUS. I HAD MERLY WANTED TO GIVE A FEEL FOR WHAT THE BUDGET 
130 REALLY WAS, AND THE FIGURES ARE WITHIN 10% ACCURACY I AM SURE. (IT REALLY HITS HOME WHEN NONE OF THE FIGURES ARE BELOW A
131 BILLION) I DO HAVE A TALLY OF WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM, ONE NOT NEARLY SO DETAILED, BUT FROM THE LOOKS OF THE DEBATE GOING ON
132 ABOUT IT, NO ONE GIVES A RIP. 
133 SPELL ALERT, I THINK THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE PHONE LINE CONNECTION, I SURE DID NOT SEE ANY ERRORS
134 +++++++++++++ WELL, WITH ALL THE DEBATE ABOUT NATIONAL POLITICS, I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE DO NOT OVERLOOK THE LOCALS. PORTLAND 
135 MAYORAL POLITICS ARE SURE INTERESTING THESE DAYS. LAST I HEARD, SUGGESTIONS TO THE NEW MAYOR-ELECT(BUD CLARK) CAN REACH HIM BY 
136 WRITING THEM DOWN AND PLACING THEM IN THE HANDS OF THE GEORGIA PACIFIC BLDG. 'ART' STATUES
137 ++++++++++++++++THE INTEREST RATES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE DEFINITLY NOT A FUNCTION OF THE MARKET.THEY ARE DETERMINED BY THE
138 FEDERAL MONEY SUPPLY, AND THE AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT BORROWING. RIGHT NOW, THE GOVERNMENT IS SAPPING THE POOL OF CAPITAL AVAILABL
139  BY FLOODING THE BOND MARKETS. THUS INVESTORS, INSTEAD OF INVESTING IN BUSINESS, ARE GOING AFTER BONDS. THIS MEANS THAT BUSINES
140  MUST COMPETE FOR THE AVAILABLE CASH, AND THAT HELPS TO PUSH UP INTEREST RATES. HOWEVER, THESE PAST FEW MONTHS THE GOVERNMENT 
141 HAS BEEN PUSHING THE INTEREST RATES TO ARTIFICIAL LOWS BY INCREASING THE MONEY SUPPLY AND MAKING TAX CONDITIONS SUCH THAT MONEY
142 THAT WAS NOT FORMERLY AVAILABLE IS NOW BEING MADE AVAILABLE. FOR INSTANCE, OVERSEAS INVESTMENT IN THE U.S. IS TAXED AT A MUCH 
143 LOWER RATE NOW THAN JUST LAST YEAR. THIS IS DRAINING OFF MONEY FROM EUROPEAN MONEY MARKETS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE NOT COME 
144 HERE. THE INTEREST RATES NOW ARE JUST WHERE THE GOVERNMENT WANTS THEM, HIGH ENOUGH THAT INVESTORS WILL INVEST IN THE U.S. 
145 BANKING MARKETS, BUT LOW ENOUGH THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT REVOLTING IN THE STREET. FURTHER, THE RESCUE OD CONTINENTIAL-ILLINOISE IS A
146 PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP THE BANKING INDUSTRY FROM SHAKING, THIS FROM AN 
147 ADMINISTRATION THAT IS PLEDGED TO REMOVE'GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE' FROM BUSINESS.

161 Friar Tuck: clever.  That's the technique used by many of the aspiring comics -
162 take a commonplace action or object, and look at it Objectively.
163 Alex: The terms for the printout sound acceptable to me.  When I took
164 RPGII a couple of terms ago, the instructor gave us a problem to code which
165 he had had to code some time earlier. (for work or his own class, I can't recall
166 which).  He was rather proud of his solution.  I (speaking humbly now),
167 managed to write it in half the code, and somewhat more elegantly than his
168 solution.  Hopefully I have retained enough of it to write any necessary
169 Q & D programs.  (question: what output formatting do you have in mind?)
170 After PorSFiS, we retired to L'homme's abode, where we consumed
171 excessive quantities of vile orange liquid.  God, what a disaster.
172 You'll probably read about it in the paper Sunday.
173 P. Hawthorne: I'm not in a position to speak about inclusion in the
174 Archive buy, so I shan't.  (Ha, `spell alert', run THAT thru your spelling
175 checker!).  However, since I have been taking programming classes at PCC
176 for two years, I am curious - who is this friend who can do the printouts
177 for you?  Just wondering if I know the person (and how this printing would
178 take place).

182 Leonard: It is certainly true that a means has been provided to include
183   Newtonian Physics within the scope of modern cosmological theory, as a
184   localized phenomenon of limited scale. The point that I was addressing
185   concerns the change in the theory concerning the nature of the observer.
186   This has implications concerning the entire nature of reality, not just
187   one small sub-set of laws relating to large body interactions. Your
188   statement illustrates the point perfectly, that Newton's Laws are no
189   longer considered adequate to describe the nature of physical experience.
190 
191 A reasonable English language equivalent of an ancient oriental expression,
192 used in various contexts, goes like this: "May you live in interesting
193 times." Well, we certainly live in interesting times. Many things that once
194 seemed solid and absolute are now mere will-o-the-wisps. It's not always
195 comfortable when great changes are taking place, but it's seldom boring.
196 The very nature of the global social structure is obliged to face this
197 inevitable evolution. Instantaneous planet wide communication, rapid means
198 of transportation, and the potential for actions that can have global
199 consequences, makes it imperative to rethink the way we deal with each
200 other. There's a great experiment in progress to see if human beings can
201 evolve to a point where survival is possible, on a planet modified to
202 "suit one's desires".

205 Well put! What I am waiting for though, is the direct satellite transmission
206 systems to come into common use. (I.E. having satellites up there for that
207 specific use.) That is going to make some interesting communications problems
208 Most notibly, countries (particulaly the U.S and USSR) will be able to feed
209 their propaganda programs direct to the people they want. Just as important
210 though, people in underdeveloped areas will have acess to a significantly
211 improved communications service. Thus allowing them to get a better view of
212 the world around them. Maybe this will reduce the chance of such things as 
213 war, since it becomes much more difficult for one side to lie when both
214 sides of the story are available to the general populance. Maybe that's why
215 it hasn't happened by now? No, I think it is only that nobody has figured 
216 out how to recover the money put into the project yet. Ah well...

222 I REMEMBER THINKING ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS THE SCENERY FLASHED PAST
223 US, AS WE WERE HURTLED THROUGH SPACE, LATE LAST NIGHT, A MAD MAN
224 AT THE CONTROLS OF A '67 MUSTANG. MY HEAD WAS REELING FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE VILE
225 ORANGE LIQUID, AND MY MIND CRIED OUT FOR DRAMAMINE. AS WE LEFT EVERYTHING ON 82N
226 STREET FAR BEHIND, I WONDERED IF DREAMTOUCHER AND I WOULD EVER SAFELY REACH HOME.
227 I HAPPENED TO LOOK OUT THE BACK WINDOW, AND JUST HAPPENED TO SEE
228  RED AND BLUE FLASHING LIGHTS FAR BEHIND US. THE DRIVER REACHED
229 UNDER THE DASH, AND DID SOMETHING I COULDN'T SEE, AND SUDDENLY, WITH A HORRIBLE
230 SHRIEKING SOUND, ACCOMPANIED BY
231 THE SMELL OF BURNING RUBBER, WE WERE MILES AWAY, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF GLISAN. 
232 DREAMTOUCHER PILED OUT ONTO THE STREET, KISSING THE GROUND, AND
233 SHAKING IN OUR SHOES. AND THEN, WITH
234 A HEARTY "HI HO THE MUSTANG WAS GONE.     DELTA FIVE
235 WASSIR: I WAITED FOR THREE HOURS AT THAT SWISHY CAFE, AND YOU
236 DIDN'T SHOW. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT I HAD TO FIGHT OFF A HORDE OF

244   WHEN DREAMTOUCHER AGAIN WOKE HE WAS IN A SMALL METAL ROOM.  SNOWRUNNER PACED
245 NEARBY.  ELXTIA WAS TALKING TO HIM OUT OF A SMALL 'WINDOW' ABOVE A TECNOLOGY
246 ENCRUSTED DESK NEARBY.
247   HE AROSE QUICKLY AND LOOKED FRANTICLY AROUND FOR HIS PACK AND WALKING STICK.
248   SHE EXPLAINED HOW TO OPEN THE BOX IN THE WALL IN WHICH IT WAS STOED.
249   THEMNAX MET HIM AT THE DOOR WHEN HE EMERGED.  "WEVE DECEIDED WE HAVE TO
250 GO IN.  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO COME WITH US, CAPTAIN SUREMVEN WILL DROP YOU
251 OFF AT THE PLANET GLISON, WHICH IS IN A PART OF SPACE EARTH HUMANS CALL

253   "NO; I'VE BEEN AROUND HUMANS THIS LONG NOW, AND BESIDES, IN LAST NIGHT'S

262   WHEN, IN STEALTH MODE, THEY SET DOWN AT THE PARRALLEL INN (PC+S) 
263 DREAMTOUCHER WAS GLAD TO BE FREE OF THE NARROW CONFINES OF ELXTIAS 'BOAT'.
264   BUT IT WAS FROM ONE NEED TO MOVE AT AN UNCOMPFORTABLY QUICK PACE TO ANOTHER.

357 TO: ALL. FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS (EXACT LENGTH OF TIME IS
358 CLASSIFIED) I HAVE BEEN DOWNLOADING ENTRIES FROM EVERY
359 BBS IN THIS SECTOR. ALL OF THESE
360 FILES HAVE BEEN INPUTED INTO A MASSIVE BBSSORT PROGRAM, AND HAVE
361 BEEN CROSS REFERENCED INTO A (CLASSIFIED) NUMBER OF CATEGORIES WHICH INCLUDE 
362 SUCH FACTORS AS SPELLING ERRORS,SYNTAX, AVEREGE LENGTH OF ENTRY, TIME OF DAY
363 , KNOWN WORKING HOURS OF ENTRANTS, SOCIAL REDEEMING VALUE OF ENTRIES, C
364 COMPARISON WITH ENTRIES ON OTHER BBS'S, AND A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS.
365 AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS OF SORTING ON AN IBM 360-70, THE RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
366 LUKE BINKELEYWALKER IS REALLY JOSHUA, AND HIS ENTRIES ARE MADE ONLY AFTER 5 PM
367 ON SATURDAY.(>STAR-TREK).
368 TEDDY SALAD, AND TOM TOM ARE THE SAME PERSON
369 AND ALL OF THEIR COLLECTIVE ENTRIES WERE MADE FROM AN EPSON CONNECTED TO A PHONE
370 IN THE HOLLYWOOD AREA THAT HAS BEEN CALL-FORWARDED TO A PHONE IN THE 97203 AREA.
371 
372 SOMEONE USING AN IBM/PC HAS TIED INTO THE SMART MODEM OF AN UNSMART
373 SYSOP OF A LITTLE KNOWN BBS, AND HAS BEEN LEAVING MESSAGES THAT
374 CERTAIN TWITS HAVE BEEN COPYING AND THEN ENTERING ON BWMS. 
375 IN NORTHWEST PORTLAND, THERE IS A SMALL APARTMENT THAT CONTAINS
376 NOTHING MORE THAN A RADIO SHACK
377 MODEL 100, AND A LONG WIRE THAT
378 TAPS A NEIGHBORS PHONE. ONCE A WEEK, THE RENT IS PAID BY WACKER SILTRONICS 
379 MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSE FUND.
380 AN AGENCY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A REPEATER "HIDDEN" SOMEWHERE DEEP IN 
381 THE FOREST PARK WILDERNESS. SOMEONE HAS TAPPED INTO IT, AND
382 HAS ESTABLISHED A LINK WITH THE APARTMENT IN NORTHWEST PORTLAND.

385 Voyeur:whats with this changing my beloved boarder? I put in those just for you!
386 The above:Andre?!? I knew you were still around but I thought they had you at 
387 that special farm the C.I.A. keeps for S.A.L.O.G. agents who have been cought.
388 I see you must have escaped. I show Morby as Joshua, but only with a 5% 
389 difference ratio on the social-redeeming-value scale, it could be Binklywalker.
390 IBM 360-70? dear god, and probably all in B.A.L. too! do you need some nice
391 vax-11/782 time? I have been running my programs on a SALOG supplied 11/780.
392 only takes 2 weeks of solid runtime.
393 However, I show some little inconsistencies with your readings. First, the Epson
394 QX-10 is in St.Johns approx. 35 feet from the local bong shoppe/burrito store.
395 You failed to mention that the Model 100 has every option on it that Radio Shack
396 sells, and even some it doesn't! I knew Wacker Siltronic paid for the room,
397 but what about the drivers PERMIT of its sole occupent? Ha! bet you didn't know
398 about the occupent!
399 I also show the communications line from forest sight beta to be a radio link 
400 between tri-met busses to avoid any and all traceing.I know not where the r
401 reciever is, it works.
402 SALOG agent CP-5 out.

414 THE TRI-MET CONNECTION,EXCEPT THAT THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE INVOLVED
415 ONE HAS, APPARENTLY, FOUND A WAY TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO PARKED BUSSES
416 AND MAKE CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO THEIR CODE BURST TRANSMITTERS.
417 LISTEN ON 452.825 MHZ (OR 453.755).THEIR ASCII TRANSMISSIONS ( ASSUMING YOU HAVE THE FACILITIES TO DECODE THEM)
418 CONTAIN FREQUENT REFERENCES TO
419 SOMEONE WITH A NAME LIKE NUTWUN.(IT'S USUALLY GARBLED).
420 BRILLIANT IDEA, USING TRI-MUTTS REPEATER. I HAVE HEARD THEM 
421 DISCUSSING THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME PROBLEM WITH THEIR RADIOS
422 ON 452.375. I COULD HAVE WRONG ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE EPSON
423 BUT HAVE CONFIRMED THE CALL FORWARDING BEING FROM THE HOLLYWOOD AREA. (I HAVE A FRIEND WHO WORKS THE TELEQUEST LINES)
424 AND CAN GET THE USUAL "NOT ASSIGNED" INFORMATION. I HAVE OTHER EVIDENCE OF 'NOMES DE PLEUM" (YEAH, I KNOW SPELL ALERT)
425 NAMES I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T RELEASE LATER, BUT PROBABLY WILL. LATER.

427 THE MOST IMPORTANT MONEY/POWER/ROMANTIC-LOVE DISCOVERY SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
428 An entire new field of knowledge has been discovered by Dr. Frank R. Wallace, a former Senior Research Chemist
429 for E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. Since mid-1976, Dr. Wallace has researched Psychuous Sex to uncover a powerful array
430 of new knowledge called Neo-Tech. That new knowledge allows any person to prosper monetarily, personally, romantically,
431 sexually, and financially anywhere in the world, even during personal or financial hard times, inflation, boom times,
432 recession, depression, war.
433 Neo-Tech is a new, scientific method for capturing major financial and personal advantages everywhere. Neo-Tech is
434 a new knowledge that has nothing to do with positive thinking, religion, or anything mystical. Once a person is exposed to
435 Neo-Tech, he can quietly profit from anyone - anywhere, anytime. He can prosper almost anywhere on earth and succeed under
436 almost any economic or political conditions. Combined with Psychuous Sex, Neo-Tech applies to all money and power
437 gathering techniques - to all situations involving the transfer of money, power, or love.
438 Neo-Tech has its roots in the constant financial pressures and incentives to develop the easiest, most profitable
439 methods of gaining advantages. Over the decades, all successful salesmen, businessmen, politicians, writers, lawyers,
440 entrepreneurs, investors, speculators, gamers, and Casanovas have secretly searched for shortcuts that require little
441 skill yet contain the invisible effectiveness of the most advanced techniques. Dr. Wallace identified those shortcuts
442 and honed them into practical formats called Neo-Tech. These never-before-known formats transfer money, power, and
443 prestige from the uninformed to the informed. Those informed can automatically take control of most situations involving
444 money and power.
445 Who is the Neo-Tech Man? He is a man of quite power - a man who cannot lose. He can extract money at will. He can
446 control anyone unknowledgeable about Neo-Tech - man or women.
447 The Neo-Tech man has the power to render others helpless, even wipe them out, but he wisely chooses to use just enough
448 power to give himself unbeatable casino-like advantages in all endeavors for maximum long-range profits. His Neo-Tech
449 maneuvers are so subtle that they can be executed with casual confidence. His hidden techniques let him win consistently
450 and comfortably - year after year, decade after decade. Eventually, Neo-Tech men and women will quietly rule everywhere.
451 The Neo-Tech man can easily and safely beat any opponent. He can quickly impoverish anyone he chooses. He can immediately
452 and consistently acquire large chunks of money, $2000, $10000, or more in a single day, repeatedly. He has the power to
453 make more money in a week than most people can make in a full year without knowing Neo-Tech. He commands profits and respect.
454 He controls business deals and emotional situations to acquire money and power...and to command love. He can regain lost
455 love. He can subjugate a business or personal adversary. He wins any lover at will. He can predict stock prices - even gold
456 and silver prices...He quietly rules all.
457 Within A Week, An Ordinary Person Can Become A Professional Neo-Tech Practitioner. As people gain this knowledge, they
458 will immediately begin using its techniques because they are irresistibly easy, yet completely potent. Within days after 
459 gaining this knowledge, a person can safely bankrupt opponents - or slowly profit from them, week after week. He can benefit
460 from business and investment endeavors - from dealing with the boss to the biggest oil deal. He can also benefit from any
461 relationship - from gaining the repect of peers to inducing love from a partner or regaining lost love from an ex-partner.
462 He will gain easy money and power in business, investments, the professions, politics, and personal life.
463 Indeed, with Neo-Tech, a person not only captures unbeatable advantages over others, but commands shortcuts to
464 profits, power, and romance. The ordinary person can quickly become a Clark Kent - a quite superman - taking command of all.
465 He can fincancially and emotionally control whomever he deals with. He becomes the man-on-the-hill, now. He is armed with
466 unbeatable weapons. All will yield to the new-breed Neo-Tech man, the no-limit man. All except the Neo-Tech man will die 
467 unfulfilled.
468 Order now...Don't delay

550 To the forgotten adventure in RAINdeer (petrov where are you???)
551 
552 "Dr. Spock", I said with the cool voice that knowledge has to offer.
553   "Very well", the trunk replied as it opened to reveal its contents: Our
554 luggage, and more importantly, my NET issue camera. Our mission was to extract
555 as much information about the operation of the Rajneesh cult as possible, then
556 take the appropriate actions to end the cult's regime in Oregon, and return the
557 land to the 1001 Pals of Oregon, that band of lawyers, who were recently featured
558 in the Steven Spielberg hit movie, "Laws - Just when you thought it was safe
559 to back into the courtroom"
560 Joshua was playing the part of a Pals representative, while Gaudy and
561 I played the part of reporter and photographer. We hoped our guise would be
562 sufficient to get us in to the inner sanctum of the cult, and then to our goal,
563 Rajneesh Dangerfield.
564 Ma Prem Rivers was our guide for the little excursion from the road to
565 the group of buildings that made up the central part of the RAINdeer community.
566 I clicked off a few shots with my camera while Rivers expounded the virtues
567 of the Rajneesh religion, and what the deciples in RAINdeer were doing to 
568 further its cause.
569 Gaudy played her best Ed Bradley, while trying not to be too obvious in
570 her distaste for this obvious facade the money and power hungry guru was
571 putting on. 
572 As we made our way to the largest of the central buildings, I noticed
573 through the infa-red sensor in my camera one building that seemed to have a
574 much higher mean temperature than the rest of the buildings. There was no
575 noticeable activity near the building, but the readings were unmistakable.
576    "What's in that building", I asked Rivers, pointing towards the 'hot'
577 building.
578    "Oh that...That's just a storage barn for food", she replied in a cool and
579 trained manner most likely used for inquisitive people like us. But there was
580 a trace of worry my NET tuned senses picked up. Just a trace, but still
581    "It is now time to meet the High Council of RAINdeer. Please no pictures
582 until you are told it is ok.", Rivers told us as we entered the large green
583 building.
584    "The high council indeed", I thought to myself as I switched my camera to
585 "L".
