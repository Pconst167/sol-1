21   Hmm -- the view from here is quite clear.  A whole disk below me, and
22 me with very little to say.  One thing does come to mind though...
23 (squeamy stomach warning!)
24   I've held a philosophical point of view for some time:  If a person is 
25 going to eat the flesh of living creatures, s/he is obligated to accept the
26 responsibility for that creature's death.  Our recent National Pig-Out Day
27 is no exception.  Where did your meal come from?  Mine came from an egg,
28 kept warm and moist for 28 days, then sprawled out of the cracked shell
29 wet and weak to visit this big new world.  I taught the little creature to
30 eat (Turkeys don't lack smarts, they have an excess of DUMB) by tapping in
31 the food with my finger.  Marbles in the water make reflections -- the
32 little bird pecks at them -- and misses.  A few beakfuls of water, and the
33 systems are all running.  
34   Little birds imprint.  They take the first moving, living thing they see,
35 and for the rest of their life, that is MOTHER.  How would you feel, if as
36 a tiny baby, you saw MOTHER only once or twice a day?  If MOTHER only kept
37 your food and water full, and perhaps gave you a tiny amount of attention?
38   In about 4 weeks, the little bird has grown a nice crop of feathers.  It's
39 stronger now, although it still wants to follow MOTHER.  It can go out into
40 summer shelter, although you must carefully put it inside at night.
41   As the months progress, the bird grows.  It puts on several suits of feathers
42 until it takes on it's adult plumage.  It still comes running to follow
43 MOTHER, however.  Turkeys may be dumb, but they also know whose hand holds
44 the feed can. 
45   Cold weather finds the bird nearly adult.  The small squaack sounds it made
46 has graduated to a classic gobble.  Proud of itself, it struts, displaying 
47 its tail feathers in a classic   
48   Throughout its whole life, this bird has known nothing but kindness.  
49 Gentle hands do not terrify it -- although it doesn't like to be handled,
50 it doesn't struggle when it is picked up.  It even endures the loop of twine
51 around its feet, for what harm can MOTHER do?  The flicker of the birds
52 eyelids is feather soft in the palm of the hand that holds its neck across
53 the chopping block.
54   I believe that the bird died quickly -- I hope that it was quickly enough
55 that no sense of betrayal ended its life... but I will never know.
56 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

86 I appear to have been twitted from the Bit Bucket. I called a few 
87 minutes ago (14:40) and my number now belongs to somebody called 
88 "Brian" and when I tried logging on with my own name the board hangs
89 up on me. I don't remember havong done anything to rate this treatment
90 so maybe it's a system foulup. Anyway, since I cannot get back on, 
91 would somebody with Bucket access (I know there are a few out there)
92 please sent a message to the sysop asking why I have been booted off 
93 the system? I would really appreciate it.

108 We're still trying our darndest to heat our house with nothing but wood.
109 Well, lighting the wood on fire anyway, wood itself isn't much good except for
110 termites. We're getting used to the cold, but during the "warm spell" we had
111 a few days back, as soon as it got
112 above freezing outside we opened up the windows to heat up  the house.
113 
114 My biggest problem is lighting those darn fires. I've got a good supply of
115 newspapers and dry kindling. It's no problem  to light those things. In fact,
116 I rarely use more than  three matches. It's the wood that's tough.
117 
118 My father-in-law can light up a roaring fire in about fifteen seconds.  I swear
119 he could light one by hitting his fingernail on a piece of rock, and have one
120 big dripping wet log roaring in no time.
121 But as for me, I usually spend about forty-five minutes lighting up the kind-
122 ling. I get a great fire from the newspaper for about half a minute, and then
123 some of the kindling sort of glows, but then it all dies out. I work the bellows
124 until I'm in a sweat, but all that does is blow it out.
125 
126 Sometimes I do get lots of kindling going. I pile on about a foot of the small
127 loose sticks, and if I'm lucky, I get a roaring fire. Feeling confident, I
128 then throw on a full-sized log.
129 
130 About ten minutes later I have a few glowing embers at the bottom of the fire-
131 place and a slightly singed log sitting on top of them.
132 
133 I've used hair driers to get the flames going, I've blown on them 'til I've
134 fainted, and gone through three different bellows. Last time I went to the
135 store for a replacement, I asked for a magnum. The clerk just gave me a funny
136 look and shook his head.
137 
138 Last night I got so frustrated I ran into the garage and grabbed a can of
139 lighter fluid- the kind for barbecues. I doused the entire inside of the
140 fireplace with the stuff, but the embers were so died down *that* didn't even
141 light it up.
142 
143 So I threw a match in.
144 
145 The charred brick all around the fireplace is tough to get out. And the painting
146 above it will never look the same. And probably my eyebrows either.
147 
148 We use electric heat now. We may be poor, but we're warm.

160 
161 My son at Baylor University has a Sanyo 555 with the video ram board modification. He uses a Hayes Smartmodem
162 (300 baud) and copylink to connect to the university's vax system. he'd like to be able to use crosstalk ot
163 (or) pc-vt to emulate a vt100 but neither will work on his machine. We've also tried to run kermit and qmodem
164 with the same results. All will load but each acts as if there were no modem connected to the port. In fact,
165 crosstalk gives error messages to that effect. Copylink works fine, but it had to be patched when he first
166 bought it (using info which came with the program). We're assuming the other programs mentioned might have
167 to be patched, too, but we keep drawing blanks. Can anyone help?
168 One more plea....doea anyone know of a way to generate an alternate key function on the sanyo 555? even if we
169 are ever able to get qmodem, pc-talk, etc. to run, he wouldn't be able to do much--if anything--with them since
170 the sanyo 555 has no alt key.
171 if anyone can help, please send a note to huggins@isie.

211 As he studied the walls, framed pictures
212 looked back at him. "This was once a grand place", he thought. The eyes of Teddy
213 Roosevelt assured him that at one time this was the spot for action
214 Now, with its aging walls and once beautiful barmaids, the hotel remained open
215 for ignorant tourists, discreet relationships, and people like himself.
216 Jack was lost in his brandy when a voice startled him. "Sir?", the bellboy
217 tapped Jack's shoulder cautiously, as if he knew why Jack was there.
218 "Telephone,Sir. You are Mr.-" 
219 "Yes", Jack interrupted,"Thanks".
220 As he eased out of his chair, he tugged at the crease in his trousers. The bll
221 boy lead him to a private phone. In a few moments he was back in his chair,lean
222 ing comfortably against the wall and learing at the stairway.
223 Everything was set. He ordered another brandy and eyed the man reading the 
224 Daliy Journal. The man coyghed twice and set his paper down. In seconds, 
225 the man was gone.
226   Ok, about this snow business, my vote is to keep it coming down.(Its a 
227 selfish vote, mind you. I get paid whether its there or not!)
228   And as far as these turkeys, to the person who objects, have you ever sen a 
229 turkey peck to death one of its own?
230 Well they will, I saw one peck a chick to death because when it hatched 
231 there was a spot of blood on it- turkeys are almost as vicsious as we are!
232 Why not stop worrying about what you eat, and be concerned about those 
233 who aren't eating?
234 Well, this is getting too serious for me, I am really not like this!

I have philisophical and ethical leanings toward vegetarianism -- but

266 however, believe in accepting the consequences of my actions in eating
267 flesh and using animal products.  One of these consequences is the death
268 of other living beings for my convenience.  I can and do accept that.  
269 I cannot, however, condone cruelty towards animals (an attitude that those
270 who lived in the middle ages would find hard to fathom -- they felt that
271 panic improved the flavor of flesh... no animal died easy then).  Insofar
272 as I am the economic cause of these creature's death,  I feel the respons-
273 ibility to ensure that their death is painless as possible.  The pain I
274 feel while actually killing a creature atones in some small way for taking
275 that creature's life -- I try to make that life as pleasant as possible
276 while it lasts.  Well, time for a leftover turkey sandwich...

298      "Yes, of course. Now tell me Fellows, what was your dream about?" Dr
299 Macrobius leaned forward in his deep leather chair, his legal paper pad in
300 one hand, and a Cross classic black pen in the other.
301      "Oh, I, well doctor, it is very hard to describe. It was vivid enough,
302 but I find it difficult to relay it to you because it was so strange to me."
303      "Fellows, you have to relax. I can't help you with your dream unless
304 you tell me about it. That is what you want isn't it Fellows?"
305      "Yes, I want your help. Ok, I'll try." Fellows paused for a moment. He
306 sat back on the finely appointed couch, drew in a deep breath, and relaxed
307 his muscles and his mind. "It went something like this. I'm standing at one
308 end of a large field of tall grass surrounded by a dark green forest. It is
309 clear and sunny and I can see many people gathered in an area at the opposite
310 end of the field. One more strange thing. The grass is dead and dry on my
311 end of the field, but it is deep green at the other end where the people
312 are. Suddenly, one of the people at the other end of the field turns and
313 waves at me. I start walking towards the group of people, but the grass is
314 tugging at my feet. The person, who I can now see is a woman, is still waving.
315 Others have turned and are looking at me too. I try to run faster but the
316 more I run the more the grass pulls at my feet and my legs. It is a real
317 struggle, but I am making progress. I start to breath hard, and the only
318 sound I can hear is my heart pounding in my ears. Finally I break out of the
319 tall dry grass and stumble out onto the shorter green grass of the other end.
320 I look up and the people have their backs turned to me.
321 I get up and the people are gone. I rub my eyes and when I look again, I am
322 back in the tall dead grass, and in the opposite direction, there are a 
323 bunch of people looking my way and laughing. I start to walk towards them
324 again, but instead I turn and walk into the forest..."
325      "Just a second," Dr Macrobius interrupted "I want to ask you some 
326 questions about this first part, before you tell me about the forest."
327      "Sure doctor, whatever you say."
328      "Good enough. Now, did you recognize any of the people standing in the
329 field, especially the woman who turned initially?"
330      "That's funny doctor, because while I didn't recognize any of the people
331 by appearance, I felt I knew them. I think that is why I was so quick to run
332 after them."
333      "Of course. Now, did you see anything else in particular about the field
334 or the forest around it?"
335      "No, I can't think of any."
336      "How about the sky? Did you notice anything strange about the sky?"
337      "No. It was clear and sunny, like I said. I didn't pay attention to
338 anything else once I started running towards the people."
339      "Ok, now, go on with your dream. You were walking towards the dark
340 forest."
341      "Yah, the forest." Fellows paused again, as his face took on an even
342 paler shade of white.

346 ...And snow does its wonders, even if it only places a cover over the dark
347 dank world of ours, giving a luster of brilliance to all that it encompasses.
348 Sit back and see the snow for what it is, a cover of beauty and wonder that
349 we are priviledged enough to witness.

353 The only thing that I don't like about the winter months is the poor snow that
354 landed on the roads where it is turned into a brown mush.  It looks awfull and
355 I'd bet it would be pretty embarasing for the little snow flakes that have to
356 live with it.
357 As for eating flesh from another animal - I don't feel responsible for thier
358 deaths, the people that killed it should.  Unless it was you and your axe that
359 cut it's life short then you should have the same done to you!

378 WHAT THE DEAL WAS WITH YOUR DELETION, AND HE SAID THAT IT 
379 WAS PROBABLY DUE TO A SYSTEM CRASH THAT TOOK PLACE A COUPLA
380 DAYS AGO, AND THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO RE-APPLY FOR A PSWD.

386 Oh!  That "darn" snow!  The Gorge (Columbia, don't 'cha know) was an actual
387 terror for returning college students this 1st of December.  With wind gusts
388 of 50mph and over, blizzard conditions, icing (icing?) rain, and all in 
389 combination with the blue VW-Squareback (19--, don't 'cha know).
390 	Ask me to tell you THAT story sometime! (You know about when they say
391 you are close to biting the Big One, that your life passes before your eyes?
392 Well, I'm here to say, it don't.)
393         And then more good news when I get home; my system crashed the day
394 after I left!  FEH!! (Yiddish, don't 'cha know).

405 And thanks for liking my story, badly plotted though it was. Next one's going

410 The snow is great...fascinating, to a SoCal girl like me (snow?  without
411 ski lifts?)...but the hole in my favorite shoes (and the corresponding
412 hole in the socks I had on today) admits too much of the white stuff
413 for comfort.  It's beautiful, though; snow makes edges less distinct and
414 swirls, eerie, on the road at night.  It muffles sound like cotton, when
415 the wind dies down.  Stay warm, y'all!

418 Early AM.  Too bad, not much comment on the ethical issues.  Oh well...
419 Time to disconnect and face the frozen stuff on the roads.
420   Just an observation -- it's the first time since I left Montana that I'vef
421 seen the shifting arabesques of drifting snow in the road.  Sorry, but I
422 definitely prefer my H2O in liquid form.  Oregon rain, where are you?

427 A question of snow?  I love it!  Although my "grey and small white s
428 spottedness" is diffiicult to hide in snow.  However, the problem has been 
429 lately solcving itself, what with all the grey snow we come across as of late.

433      Dreamtoucher was silent.  The shock of this sudden movement to another p
434 place must be still setting in.  Gazing at our surroundings, I noticed that the
435 place where we had "landed" was not unlike my home.  A clear stream was to t
436 the west, and the sound of it running aoainst the rocks was a welcome change 
437 from the sound of so many voices in unisomn at the Inn.  
438      Snowrunner and I didn't sense any immediate danger so we waited, the warm
439 sun beutiful in the sky.  Dreamtoucher gently touched my shoulder, and I jumped
440 about 14 feet.  "Zephyr.." he sent,  "We have little time for relaxing.  We must
441 find out where we are, and if possible, find a way  back to the Inn."

478 Those who try and deny our carniverous nature are indeed denying their very
479 roots. We were created to eat animals, whether you believe in pure evolution
480 or creationism, as a higher form of
481 life and as hunters we have a right, neigh, a responsibility to eat other
482 animals. It is not cruel, it is their destiny, just as the hunted is eaten
483 by the hunted in nature.
484 
485 Nature, and survival is a cruel thing in nature, if cruelty is defined as
486 death.
487 
488 But cruelty to animals is a whole 'nuther subject: it's not so much what is
489 done to them, and the pain they suffer, rather, it's the indication of what is
490 in the heart of those who torture, whether it's insects, animals, or in 
491 Germany and earlier U.S. case, jews and negroes. So it's a reflection of evil
492 in the heart, not an act on it's own, that is terrible because a dumb animal
493 suffers.
494 
495 Red meat is the only food nature provides which man can live on alone and
496 reap all the nutrients necessary for survival. That should tell you
497 something...

529 Greetings,
530       Leo had given her report to the old woman(report to be posted) and
531 had spent a week relaxing in her home and watching the wind and snow
532 thunderr by her window.  No Alex or Ontho around to bug her.  Just a chance
533 to relax. For a week..   A slight taw rolled into town and The Old Woman
534 showed up at her door.  After the normal, "hello, how are you surving the
535 cold?" and other such greetings, The duo settled in on the couch.  The
536 old woman was as usual straight to the point on what Leo's future mission
537 would include.  Using "Tri-juice" Leo would return with Alex, taking along
538 several other passengers.  Their mission:   Populate the alternate universe
539 The remaining ships were due to rendezvous in less than 2 Months.  Timming
540 was important.  
541     Leo looked at the old woman, her mouth slightly agap at the words that
542 were comming out of the old womans mouth.  Her reply:  "When was the last
543 time you undertook this kind of mission?"  The old woman:  My dear, your
544 the one thats taking on this one.  You and that trident are the portal
545 through which we can pass thru, without you no mission could possibly
546 exsist"  (Authors note:  I think the old woman is pulling her leg.)
547      Leo stared at the floor, still dazed at the indirect impacts this
548 was going to have on her.  She looked up and innocently replied:  Sounds
549 good, when do we start?".   And "can Ontho come along?"  
550    "sure", And now for those d-tails...
