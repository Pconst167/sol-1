3 Welcome to BWMS (Backwater Message System)  Mike Day System operator

5 GENERAL DISCLAIMER: BWMS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INFORMATION PLACED ON
6                     THIS SYSTEM.
7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privatly owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system.
10 It is intended that the system be normally used for messages and
11 advertisments by the users. As the system is privatly owned, I retain the
12 right to remove any and all messages which I may find offensive
13 to me. Additionally because of the limited size of the disk, it will be
14 periodically purged of older messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
15 The saved information will be cycled to drive 'B' while the information on
16 drive 'B' will be archived, and a fresh disk will be installed in drive 'A'.
17 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out
18 of the enter mode. The message is automaticly stored.
19 If after entering the message you find you made a mistake,
20 use the replace command to replace the line.
21 To exit from the system, type 'OFF' then hang up.
22 Type 'HELP' to see other commands that are available on the system.
23 ========================================
24 
25 I have been asked to comment on the recent goings on here, very well, i
26 shall provide it. "No comment".
27 I do not have strong feelings as to how this system is used, as long as
28 it doesn't get too far out of hand I refuse to do any thing in any way.
29 There have been a few complaints about "lurkers" hanging on the system 
30 for hours. I assure you, that this is not the case. The average connect
31 time is 15 min. If anything, the abusers of time are the 'old timers'.
32 here, when they get into a rave they can hang on for over an hour.
33 (Including yours truly I'm afraid!)
34 Anyhow, as you have noticed, yes the system is in transistion yet once
35 again. This is inevitable. The system always fluctuates. Some will survive
36 the change, and others will move on. I think that the upcoming bwms party 
37 (assuming it takes place; which it appears now that it will) will have
38 a major impact on the new form which bwms will take. We'll see.
39 As for party time, I am open as log as I can get a weeks warning to be
40 able to schedule around it. Though I must warn you that business will
41 take presidence. I will notify you in advance as I am unable to make it
42 if it comes to that, though I do hope that that won't happen.
43 ******** CISTOP MIKEY *********** 13 NOV 83 ********* 8:30PM ***********
44 P.S. I JUST WASTED 1/2 HOUR OF YOUR PRECIOUS TIME, SO I'LL GET OFF AND
45 LET SOMEONE ELSE USE BWMS.

50   Finally got almost everything working on my terminal program. I still have
51 to work on the buffer section, and the set-up menu...but the rest works fine.

54 selected day. And last....

56 I vote to CAN Jody and Luke...I've heard it before on this system, and I
57 don't think we need it again.

85 To Aaron...OryCon...at times a zoo, at other times frustrating, at other
86 times, pure euphoria to a true SF fan. Several hundred attended, but it
87 usually didn't feel like it was over crowded. Some of the panel discusions
88 and guest speakers were very interesting, others were, shall we say, old
89 hat and boring.
90 All in all, a pretty enjoyable show, but let me tell you, there are some
91 strang people down there. They really come out at the costume party!
92 
93 The DEC system I use runs TOPS20, a truely enjoyable OS. Are you familiar
94 with it?
95 Interesting idea for your new BBS. But one note. I have seen this before,
96 and when too many restrictions on membership occur, the BBS soon restricts
97 itself right out of members. I am confident, that if you go ahead with
98 your plans, you will use good judgement.

103 This is a very loose and unrestricted BBS, as compared with the others I've
104 been looking at lately. I'm just trying out this Hayes Micromodem on trial
105 for a few days, and am still uncertain whether I'll buy it or not. In the
106 mean time, I've been dialing up numerous other BBS's, and so far this is by
107 FAR the most liberal....although it did take me all day to get on-line.
108 Anyway, thanks for the insight.

116  Dropped Bit:  No, never have used it. I fear I wouldn't like it unless
117 it's very VMS or MPE like. As to the restrictive environment, I too share
118 your fears of it getting out of hand. I don't want to restrict what is said
119 on my system; just who says it. (!) I would picture it to be a safe haven; a
120 refuge from the storm, where the users know each other and the system.

122  Are you a programmer, or are you into systems management, or an end user?

145   Well, I have definatly seen it from all points..though seems that most 
146 people don't mind Luke and I conversing this way on this system. However....
147 there still is that few who don't want us to use this system. Question: if 
148 we don't stop..... are you going to quit using this system?
149 If so then I think we should kick this thing in the bucket. But I really 
150 don't think any of you would change from the Inn to a lesser just because of
151 a small quavering of the hearts.      WOULD YOU????
152 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxJodyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxP.S.xx
153  Luke: howdy...... haven't heard from you in a while. I hope this (small) 
154 rant doesn't drive you off.(hee,haw).

164 Dearest Jody,
165    No small rant would drive me off. Until you say so I am going to
166 continue this. I would really like to meet you, but it sounds like your
167 weekend schedule is used up for next weekend. When is your next available
168 time? Are you going to be busy friday too? My heart grows lonelier each
169 and every day! The ball is in your court. What do you say? I'll be 
170 checking in later today(if I can get through)...

175  Hello dear Luke........
176 Ths friday is bad too. Any other weekend would be fine I think though. How 
177 about for you. I don't mind using this system. If we are forced to leave 
178 ****************************************************************************

180 
181 Jody/Luke: noone wants you to leave the system....
182  Those of us that care merely wish the conversation take a different route.

188 **************************************************************** Luke: (I 
189 was disconnectd but I'm back now). We could change to the CCBS if we have t
190 o. I really don't want to. But if this type of conversation is not wanted 
191 maybe we should keep this conversation on a different BBS. I am willing to 
192 meet you almost anytime on a weekend other than the 18th-20th. I am really 
193 curious to meet you. You have a lonely heart? Maybe I can cure it. Then 
194 again.... maybe not. And visa-versa. Have I yet told you what I looked like?
195 Did you already know? Am I going to find out your real name when I meet you?
196 I have no intensions of making you reveal yourself on this system. But maybe
197 in person??? Let me know.............

202 To you two would-be lovers:  PMS (245-xxxx) is a quiet, secluded little

204 Though a whiff of romance makes me smile, I tire of listening to it,
205 and encourage both of you to contribute IDEAS when visiting the Inn!

209 OK...enough is enough. One last message to Jody, and after that, I'll try to
210 get back into the traditional conversations that was prevalent in the Inn before
211 I met Jody.
212 To Jody...the weekend of 25-27th is good. That also happens to be Thanksgiving
213 weekend? How about you? Of course I am not going through the rest of 
214 my life as Luke. That is a mere pseudo name for use only on BWMS. Of line I
215 DO have a real name(as well as names people call me) Let me know on the weekend
216 thing. But we better cool it. I am still anxious to meet, but we should give
217 the other users a break(did I hear a cheer from the other patrons in the INN?)
218 anyway, chat with you later mon amour.

220 'And now for something, completely different'
221 If any other good users of the Inn watched 60 minutes last Sunday, you
222 no doubt say the segment about ABC's upcoming movie, 'The Day After'. A
223 movie which covers the affect of nuclear war on a small midwest town, that
224 happens to be located near some little ol' missle silos(targets). The anti
225 nuclear fweapons groups(pro-freeze) are having a field day. Running commercials
226 with big name stars, showing pirated copies of the movie at rallys and so forth.
227 The anti-freeze ( and moral majority leader Jerry Falwell, recovering from
228 his PentHouse interview no doubt) are very much against the movie. ABC shrugs
229 its shoulders and says the movie is a-political. Since we were just about
230 to get into a big nuclear debate(we have had everything else), how is this for
231 a base of discussion? If we can all recover from the 'Love BBS' and get back
232 to the hardline issues and stands that have made 
233 BWMS famous. Well???

253 tHE Love BBS! Well now!
254 To Aaron. I am a programmer/user. My main purpose is not programming, but
255 to accomplish my main purpose, I have to program. I have had to become quite
256 familiar with the system and computers in general to make things easier for
257 me. Are you a student/programmer/systems analyst/or what? From reading your
258 messages, it sounds like you have a good computer background.
259 It will be interesting to see the new turn BWMS will take now. What do
260 you think about the
261 whole situation? And if you would rather not answer THAT question, what is
262 your opinion of the nuclear freeze movement(just to get soemthing new
263 rolling)?
264 ...............The dropped Bit...........................................

266   Luke....
267 I am sorry to say you are probably right about cutting this fun and sweet 
268 conversation. I think the weekend of the 25th would be good. I don't see any 
269 problem with it. What should we do while we are there? Do you like the
270 Electic Palace? Thats usualy where I spend most of my time. I would enjoy 
271 doing almost anything though.(except iceskating). Well, I guess its fairly put 
272 together huh? All except time and which day. But maybe we should cross that 
273 bridge just before we come to it. Well, I guess thats it for our lovely little 
274 conversations for the time being (**sniff**sniff**).

278   Dropped Bit: Bingo! thats me! student/programmer/systems analyst. I seem
279 to be doing more systems analysis than any of the others at the moment
280 (currently translating a DP shop's accounting from "human" to "computer")
281 
282  As for BWMS becoming a lovers haven; I feel like I am listening in on one
283 of those tele-sex services advertised in Playboy , and other periodicals
284 of that ilk. I dislike it with a passion. Sysm's wrong. Leave. Please.
285 
286     If I had the power, I would remove every ICBM silo in the US in an 
287 instant; even if the USSR's were still kept. I can't justify wiping a few
288 100M humans (be they Rusky, or not) from existence just to keep the USA
289 safe from socialism or communism or anything. My relative comfort dosn't
290 equate with x number of lives.

293 WELL NOW!
294 DEAR JODY AND LUKE: PLEASE NOTE EXTENSIVE SUPPORT GIVEN TO YOU POSITION
295 AT END OF LAST DISK. DON'T LEAVE. AARON SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME AN OLD 
296 CURMUDGEON AT THE AGE OF TWENTY.(OR SO?)
297    I SHOULD HAVE CHECKED OUT THIS DISK BEFORE I STARTED FILLING UP THE END
298 OF THAT ONE. BUT WHEN I SIGNED ON THERE WAS NO ANSWER TO MY FIRST CALL,
299 JUST NO CONNECT AND I ASSUMED WRONGLY THAT MIKEY HAD JUST CHANGED DISKS
300 AS THE END OF B WAS UNUSED.
301    TO REITERATE: A FEW OF THESE TECHNONERDS WOULD RATHER BITCH AND COMPLAIN
302 THAN BILL AND COO. THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM SMARTER THAN YOU ARE.
303    DON'T LEAVE THE SYSTEM. PLEASE.
304    
305 NOW ON ANOTHER NOTE: DOES THE PLACE AT HAYDEN ISLAND ALLOW MINORS?
306 AGREE SOME SORT OF RESTAURANT BEST. AS LONG AS WE STAY IN THE RESTAURANT
307 AREA, THOSE WHO WANTED TO COULD STILL GET A BEER WHILE ACCOMODATING 
308 THOSE WHO DON'T. 
309 
310 MIKEY, WHAT ARE YOU ALLERGIC TO ? MSG? MOST OF THOSE CHINESE PLACES WILL
311 HOLD THE MSG IF YOU ASK THEM TO AND SAY YOU ARE ALLERGIC. 
312 
313 DOES ANYBODY HERE KNOW ANYONE DOING COMMERCIAL-QUALITY WORK IN COMPUTER
314 GRAPHICS FOR TV, MOVIES, OR VIDEO PRODUCTIONS, OF FOR PRINTED REPRODUCTION
315 THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH ME AND MAYBE SHOW OFF THE
316 EQUIPMENT, ETC?
317 
318 WEEKEND NEXT OK WITH ME OR WEEKEND AFTER.
319 
320 THE NEED FOR A NUCLEAR WEAPONS BAN IS SO APPARENT TO ME AT THIS POINT
321 THAT I REFUSE TO DEBATE IT ANY MORE. LETS FIND ANOTHER TOPIC. I'VE BEEN

326 
327      LUKE & JODY,  THERE IS NO ANGER ON MY PART AT LEAST, BUT A BIT OF
328 WISTFULNESS.  IT REMINDS ME OF YOUNGER DAYS (THOUGH I'M REALLY NOT THAT
329 OLD) WHEN SUCH THINGS CAME EASIER.  PLEASE DON'T GO (SORRY AARON), BUT 
330 GIVE US MORE OF YOUR MINDS AS WELL AS YOUR HEARTS.  I LIKE VARIED CON-
331 VERSATION, AND IT BOTHERS ME A LITTLE WHEN ANY ONE SUBJECT DOMINATES
332 FOR VERY LONG (INCLUDING RELIGION!).
333 
334      MIKEY, YOU SOUND A BIT IRRITATED.  IF IT WAS SOMETHING I SAID IN A 
335 FIT OF UNMITIGATED FOOLISHNESS, PLEASE FORGIVE ME.  IF IT WAS SOMETHING 
336 ANOTHER USER(S) SAID, WE'RE ALL JUST CHILDREN ANYWAY, AND KIDS DO AND
337 SAY SILLY THINGS.  BUT THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS ANGER YOU, AND I'D
338 RATHER LEAVE THE INN PERMANENTLY THAN RISK YOUR ALIENATION.
339 
340      AARON, YOUR BB SOUNDS GREAT, BUT I HAVE NEVER JOINED A "MEMBERS ONLY"
341 SYSTEM FOR TWO REASONS:
342 1) MEMBERS ONLY CLUBS BECOME STAGNANT AND BORING DUE TO THE LACK OF NEW
343 PEOPLE AND IDEAS.  HOW WOULD YOU GET NEW USERS?
344 2) I LOVE MY ANONYMITY.  IT ALLOWS ME TO SAY UNUSUAL THINGS AND TAKE 
345 CONTROVERSIAL STANDS WITHOUT THE FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT COME BACK TO HAUNT
346 ME IN MY EVERYDAY LIFE AS CLARK KENT, MILD MANNERED REPORTER....
347 FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS RELATIVE.  WE CAN SAY WHAT WE WANT, BUT WE MAY HAVE
348 TO PAY A PRICE.  HOW WOULD I PAY THE FEE AND YET REMAIN ANONYMOUS (EXCUSE
349 ME, ANON!)?
350 
351      AH, NUKES.  I ONCE WAS VERY VOCAL ABOUT SUCH THINGS, MARCHING,
352 COLLECTING DONATIONS, ETC..  I EVEN HAD A NICE LITTLE SCAR PLACED ON THE
353 SIDE OF MY HEAD BY A JACK-BOOTED STORM-TROOPER WHO DECIDED TO SHOW HOW 
354 HEROIC HE WAS BY CRACKING THE SKULL OF A BYSTANDER (I STILL BEAR SOME
355 ANIMOSITY TOWARD HIS FUHRER, REAGAN).  MAYBE MY IMPOSING 5' AND 89lbs.
356 FRIGHTENED HIM.  FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM FALWELL AND OTHERS, IT'S NOT 
357 THE FACTS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER SUCH AN EVENT THAT THEY FIND BOTHER-
358 SOME.  IT'S THE IDEA THAT THE CONCEPT OF DETERRENCE THROUGH MIGHT COULD
359 FAIL, THAT THE WAR COULD EVEN HAPPEN, THAT HAS GOTTEN UNDER THEIR SKIN.
360 
361      I'VE TAKEN UP MORE SPACE THAN I PLANNED, SO I'LL JUST SIGN OFF AND
362 LET SOMEONE ELSE GRIPE AWHILE.

374 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
375  To all: I have NO intension of leaving this particular BBS. None what so
376 ever! I am willing to cut this conversation down to an occasional reply but 
377 I won't leave this system unless sysop Mike wants me to.
378  
379  I am fairly new to this BBS though. I have just recently picked up on what 
380 the Inn was. Now I wonder who is Mikey? I sometimes think he is the sysop 
381 but the 'intro' says Mike Day is the sysop. I get confused. Would someone 
382 explain it to me?
383 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^JODY^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
384 
385 IT WAS SOFT HEADED KNEE JERK LIBERAL THINKING LIKE THAT THAT GOT
386 KRUSCHEV PURGED. ANYBODY READ HIS MEMOIRS? IT WAS CONSIDERED A MILESTONE
387 IN RUSSIAN POLITICAL LIFE WHEN THEY LET HIM LIVE AFTER BEING 'RETIRED'.
388 HE WAS THE FIRST RUSSIAN LEADER SINCE THE REVOLUTION TO LIVE THROUGH THE
389 PROCESS OUTSIDE OF SIBERIA. AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING FIGURE. SPEAKING OF
390 GOOD NUCLEAR SENSE, IT WAS PROBABLY KRUSCHEV, NOT KENNEDY, WHO KEPT THE
391 WORLD FROM BEING BLOWN UP OVER THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS. PEOPLE WORRY
392 A LOT ABOUT RUSSIAN SNEAK ATTACKS. ACTUALLY, THEY ARE QUITE CONSERVATIVE
393 IN RUSSIA ABOUT WAR. FOR CENTURIES, THEY HAVE HAD TO BE DRAGGED INTO A
394 CONFRONTATION, USUALLY BY BEING ATTACKED. 
395    REMEMBER, THEY JUST UP AND DROPPED OUT OF WORLD WAR 1. ONLY GOT INTO
396 WW2 WHEN HITLER DOUBLE CROSSED THEM AND ATTACKED. ETC.
397    THEY DO TEND TO HANG ONTO OCCUPIED TERRITORY, THOUGH. AND DO A LOT
398 OF AGITATION THROUGH SATTELITE STATES.(WHAT WE WOULD CALL OUR 'LOYAL ALLIES
399 OF THE FREE WORLD' OR SOME SUCH DRIVEL).
400    ANYWAY, IF THEIR HISTORY IS ANY INDICATION, AS WELL AS CONSIDERING
401 THE TROUBLE THEY MIGHT HAVE JUST HOLDING TOGETHER EASTERN EUROPE, (AND

403 START A MAJOR CONFRONTATION ONE ON ONE.
404    LATELY, I'VE BEEN MORE WORRIED THAT WE MIGHT DO IT. ESPECIALLY SINCE SO
405 MANY IMPORTANT PEOPLE HAVE BOMB-PROOF DIGS NOW. THERE ARE GIANT UNDERGROUND
406 APARTMENTS JUST OUTSIDE L.A. AND OTHER CITIES NOW. DEEP UNDERGROUND, SELF
407 CONTAINED FOR A YEAR AND *EXPENSIVE*. SAW AN AD FOR ONE. WHEN THE RICH HAVE
408 A CHANCE OF LIVING THROUGH A WAR, EVEN IF THEY'RE KIDDING THEMSELVES,
409 LOOK OUT! 
410     AND WHEN THE FAR-RIGHT EXTREMISTS WHO HAVE HAD SO MUCH INFLUENCE ON
411 THE GOVERNMENT LATELY REALIZE THEY MIGHT LOSE THE NEXT ELECTION AND
412 HAVE TO WAIT 20 YEARS FOR THEIR NEXT CHANCE......
413     GUESS I COULDN'T STAND THE PRESSURE OF KEEPING MY MOUTH SHUT ABOUT IT
414 AFTER ALL....... NO SURPRISE TO YOU ALL, I BET...

417 To Aaron...I'll be back in a while. Got on, then found out I had to leave
418 in a hurry. I want to address some of the things you said.
419 ............The dropped Bit............................................
420 I really can't understand what Aaron and others might dislike about the
421 conversation between Jody and Luke.  It may be more direct , but I really
422 fail to see the difference between their talk and the former manuverings
423 with the Dragon Lady.  It would take a real rationalizer (if that is a
424 proper word) to deny the obvious sexual overtones of those epistles on
425 BWMS.
426 
427 Come on gentlepeople.  What's wrong with some innocent fun.  Isn't that
428 what life should be?  It's bad enough that we have to live with the
429 specter of nuclear destruction without condemning natural heterosexual
430 attractions.

432   Why should Jody and Luke be excluded because of their particular present
433 topic.  Is it any different really than an other or should it be a rule that
434 boy must not speak to girl or vise versa.  Really, now!
435      Jody and Luke I'm with you, continue.

440 To Jody and others. Thank you very much for your support. The messages Jody
441 and I left were not meant to insult or embarrase anyone. They are what they
442 are. Someone using this system to meet someone else. I personally hope things
443 work out for the best, but if that is not the case, then so be it. I have still
444 had a lot of fun here, and I hope to continue to do so. Again I thank those
445 who saw the true light of our messages, and to the others, I apologize.
446 To Jody. The weekend of the 25th it is. What about Friday? Isn't that the
447 usual start of 'Ce weekend.'? That would be best for me. I get home from
448 work about 5:00-5:30. After that I am free. We could meet at the Electric
449 Palace, but I hope we would move on. I used to play video games alot, then
450 kind of fell out of using them, and now play them occasionally, but not
451 like I used to. Anyway, there are plenty of things to do there, eating, movies
452 , stores, and big screen TV's(whoppie). 
453 I'm sure we can find plenty to do.
454 To Hrothgar the ?. Sorry to hear you don't want to discuss the nuclear(unclear)
455 subject. Your messages are always full of insightful information, but I under-
456 stand your reasoning. I hate to harp of a subject, but I think this is one
457 where the more information available to the public, the better. The 'elite'
458 we have elected now have us in a spot. If something is not done, I am really
459 afraid that I might not see the far side of 20. I don't want to sound like
460 a 'knee jerk liberal', but the way things are escalating, I see only one
461 option for our little planet, and the option is not a good one. I wish there
462 was a simple answer, and I don't think some of the techniques used today
463 are really appropriate, but I don't see any clear paths. It is a confusing
464 subject. I don't know...I guess the only thing we can do is try to live
465 our lives and hope for the best. But that seems so hopeless to. Anybody out
466 there have any ideas for the nuclear confused?

469 PAM: THE ONLY THING THAT YOU COULD DO TO ALIENATE ME WOULD BE TO LEAVE THE
470 SYSTEM. SORRY IF I SOUNDED IRRITATED, PUT IT DOWN TO BEING IRRITATED WITH
471 THE WORLD IN GENERAL, NO OFFENSE OR PUT DOWN OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT WAS
472 MENT TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE. ANY COMPLAINT INVOLVED WAS TOWARDS MYSELF FOR
473 HAVING TO EXPLAIN FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME MY POLICY IN REGARD TO THE SYSTEM.
474 AND WISHING I COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO NOT HAVE TO DO SO ALL THE TIME.
475 AS FAR AS THE WAR DEBATE, WHEN I WAS IN THAT PERIOD OF MY LIFE TO SCREAM
476 AND SHOUT AT THE WORLD ABOUT HOW MESSED UP THINGS WERE, I DIDN'T. I WAS
477 TO BUSY DOING MY OWN THING TO CARE ABOUT THE WORLD AT LARGE. THEN WHEN
478 I DID CARE, I NO LONGER HAD MUCH TO SAY BECAUSE I WAS IN THE AIR FORCE.
479 THEN WHEN I GOT OUT I WAS TOO BUSY TRYING TO SURVIVE AND MAKE MY OWN PLACE
480 IN THE WORLD TO HAVE TIME FOR THAT SORT OF WORRYING. NOW I DON'T HAVE THE 
481 TIME TO WORRY ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING AS I'M TOO BUSY WORRYING ABOUT
482 WHERE THE NEXT $$$ IS GOING TO COME FROM TO KEEP MY COMPANY IN ITS $300
483 A DAY HABIT. (OPERATING EXPENSES, WAGES, AND OF COURSE FILLING UNCLES
484 OUTSTRETCHED HAND.) 
485 THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT THINGS, I AM! IT IS JUST
486 THAT I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO WORRY. MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT REAGAN
487 APPEARS TO BE VERY TRIGGER HAPPY NOW WITH HIS APPARENT 'SUCCESS' IN
488 GRANADA. I AM VERY WORRIED THAT THIS COULD PUT THE US IN DIRECT WAR
489 EFFORTS IN COUTRIES THAT IT WOULD BE BEST WE STAY OUT OF. AS FAR AS
490 THE RUSKIES ARE CONCERNED, I HAVE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO BE EXPOSED
491 TO THIER LIES AND DECIET TO NOT BE FOOLED. AS FAR AS THEIR DESIRE OR
492 NON DESIRE TO GO TO WAR, IT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE GENERAL POPULANCE,
493 IT IS THE ELITE IN RUSSIA THAT MAKE THOSE SORTS OF DECISIONS JUST AS
494 IT IS IN AMERICA. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE PEOPLE CAN'T KICK OUT THE
495 RULERS IF THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY DID. OF COURSE THE WHOLE THING IS
496 A BIT POINTLESS AFTER THE PEASENTS ARE DEAD. AS FAR AS THE APPERENT
497 VIEW THAT THE WORLD WILL TURN INTO A RADIOACTIVE CINDER, I CAN'T ACCEPT
498 THAT VIEW EITHER, I HAVE BEEN CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS 
499 OF THINGS TO NOT BELIEVE THAT SORT OF THING. THAT IS NOT TO SAY HOWEVER
500 THAT MILLIONS WON'T DIE, OR THAT THERE WILL BE SOME VERY BADLY DEFACED
501 AREAS IN THE WORLD, BUT NEITHER WILL IT BE DESTROYED TOTALY. ALSO, IN
502 TIME (AND NOT ALL THAT LONG) IT WILL RECOVER. I WAS LOOKING AT A PICTURE
503 JUST THE OTHER DAY OF A SCIENTIST WALKING AROUND IN AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER
504 THAT WAS CREATED BY A N-BOMB TEST IN 1967 HE WAS NOT WEARING ANY PROTECTIVE
505 GEAR, JUST NORMAL CLOTHES. DID YOU KNOW THAT RUSSIA HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTING
506 EXCAVATION TECHNICS WITH N-BOMBS? AND WITH SOME SUCCESS. WITH A LOW 
507 RADIATION BOMB, THAT RADIOACTIVITY DROPS TO WORKABLE LEVELS WITHIN A YEAR
508 OR TWO, AND TO TOTALY SAFE LEVELS IN ABOUT 10 YEARS.
509 ************ CISTOP MIKEY ********* 15 NOV 83 ******* 11:20PM **********
510 Hrothgar, I suggest that you may hold a view of the Russian "ruling class" that
511 does not jive with real life.  Find yourself an expert in Russian strategic
512 thought, converse about it, and report back, if you will.  In several decades,
513 your theory of the more dangerous 'ruling class' may begin to be supportable,
514 but for today, Russian political aristocracy still is willing to avoid ANY
515 incursion into Soviet life/soil by ANYone else at nearly ANY cost.  My source
516 is a just-retired Air Force Colonel in my family who speaks honestly but with
517 justifiable reserve about military and political intelligence to which he was
518 recently privy as a key member of a high-priority operation recently in the
519 news.  I wouldn't rule out major ERROR by friendly leaders, but, BY DESIGN, it
520 is the Soviet system that will probably respond IN MASS to a threatening 
521 condition.Sorry, no name please

525  Luke:(sorry folks, I'll make it blunt)---> Fridays are not good for me as it is a distence from point a(my house) to point b(
526 TC) by buss on a weeknight. The weekend is best for me like saturday. I can be there anytime almost. I do prefer daytime though
527 If you would prefer night though thats fine too. I am willing to compromise. Gotta go......

531 Jody: Saturday is fine too. Don't worry about trimet. I can give you a ride
532 on 'mon voiture'. I used to ride the bus too, and I know what a hassle it can
533 be. Anyway, on Saturday I can come much earlier too. (Even though I found
534 out I don't have to work the 24th or 25th.) I am willing to compromise too.
535 Whenever is best for you is OK with me. D'accord?

538 To Mikey: I realize you have probably been exposed(in your Air force days) to
539 alot of this, and you may know more about nuclear arms then most too, but what
540 makes you say the world will not be made almost totally inhabitable. After 
541 reading reports, including Carl Sagen's article in a recent Parade, which was
542 collaberated by many scientists, and even then was considered an underestimate,
543 I don't see how our little hitching post in the galaxy could possibly survive.
544 The devastating effects of a nuclear war haven't even been totally figured
545 out yet. Melting of polar ice caps, disruption of all communications, and
546 I am not even talking about such things as presented in that classic movie
547 'Damnation Alley'(sorry, couldn't resist). If you would care to continue this
548 discussion, could you present some of your reasoning behind your statements.

598 Well, I see things have changed quite a bit in my abscense, and I perceive

600 looked for perhaps? Or have all been exhausted?

602 one world government being a successful way to ward off a nuclear confront-

611      DEBORAH, A ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT WOULD INDEED PREVENT A NUCLEAR CON-
612 FRONTATION FROM OCCURRING BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS (AS THERE WOULD ONLY BE
613 ONE), BUT WHO IS TO SAY THAT THE ONE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT BE SO CRUEL 
614 AS TO USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AS A MEANS OF KEEPING THE VARIOUS MINOR STATES
615 IT RULES IN LINE?  UNLESS THE HUMAN RACE UNDERGOES A MASSIVE PERSONALITY
616 CHANGE AND ACHIEVES SOME LEVEL OF MATURITY, I CAN'T SEE A ONE WORLD
617 GOVERNMENT BEING ANYTHING BUT A FRUIT RIPE FOR DECAY.  SOMETHING MUST BE
618 ADDED TO MAKE IT CONTINUE TO BE VIABLE AND STRONG (A CHALLENGE PERHAPS?)
619 OR IT WILL FAIL.  AND THE PROBLEMS OF STARVATION AND NEED MUST BE MET,
620 OR THE PEOPLE WILL SOON RISE UP (AS THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO DO) AND ATTEMPT
621 TO REPLACE THE GOVERNMENT.  WITH THE TOTAL LACK OF MATURITY THAT THE 
622 HUMAN RACE SHOWS, I'M AFRAID THAT THE ONLY WAY IT WILL OCCUR IS BY FORCE
623 FROM A GREATER POWER, EITHER AS IN THE BIBLE BY THE SECOND ADVENT OF
624 CHRIST, OR IN THE MANNER OF "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL" (A CLASSIC
625 S.F. MOVIE THAT, UNFORTUNATELY, SHOWS IT'S AGE) OR "CHILDHOOD'S END" BY
