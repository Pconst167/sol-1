25 Hey, look at me!  Top of the disk!  And here I am with nothing prepared.
26 L'homme: I'm busy working on the program for Clyde, and haven't had time
27 to write my next installment.  Feel free to continue with what Petrov 
28 entered.  Don't know for sure when I'll have more story; depends on how 
29 is goes with the program.
30 Speaking of Petrov,  it seems our potential ally is an escapee from
31 Westercon.  That should narrow it down. (ha).

56 Aha! Petrov is indeed a Westercon Survivor. And he has also seen Star Trek I.
57 Is it time to start advertizing? The bi-weekly meeting of the Back Water
58 irregulars is coming up this Saturday. The place...the plaza hilton...whoops!
59 Actually the place is the Main Multnomah Library downtown on 10th St. The
60 time, well that depends...PorSFiS (did I get that right?) starts around 2:00pm.
61 We usually move on to the PC&S Tavern around 3:00 or so. Sometimes sooner,
62 sometimes later. Regular Attendees have included Bard, Dream Toucher, Voyeur,
63 MIG, L'homme (moi), Milchar, Doctor, Le Nerd sysop, TMA, and last week
64 LYSIAS.
65 We would be very interested in meeting Petrov, (or are you already with us?)
66 If anyone has any more questions, anyone in the NET will be glad to help
67 out.
68 &)^#$&@)^&)@^**^
69 "Do you think they'll be tracking your car?", asked joshua.
70 "Oh I KNOW they are tracking this car. See that light labeled "BRAKES"? It
71  is actually a security sensor. They have planted a rather crude bug on
72  the car, but no matter. Let them track us. Remember, it all depends on
73  your point of view...they are following us, but we are leading them..."
74 Joshua paused for a moment, wondering if he had heard something truly
75 ingenious, or just some more BS. He decided on the later.
76 "Let's head for China Town. That's where a lot of these spy sequences end up.
77   We'll just save ourselves time looking for clues that will end up
78  pointing there anyway."
79 "Sounds good to me.", replied joshua, while at the same time thinking how 
80 strange it was for Oklahoma City to have a China Town. That thought quickly
81 diminshed as L'homme pulled his car over and parked at a 15 minute meter.
82 "Let's stop here. The traffic is too thick. We need to find ourselves some
83 native transportation anyway."
84 "Aren't you afraid of getting a ticket?", worried joshua.
85 "Not at all. Watch this. It is something that Ian gave all the net agents at
86  the last convention."
87 I pulled out the special coin that Ian had manufactured especially for net
88 agents. I placed it in the meter, and turned the dial. The meter read
89 11 minutes.
90 "And 11 minutes is where it will remain, until we return."
91 "Let's just hope they don't mark tires here", joshua laughed.
92 "Oh...well...the NET hasn't figured everything out yet.", I replied with less
93 than usual exuberance.
94 We managed to hail a chinese taxi cab rather quickly. The driver didn't really
95 pay much attention to us, until suddenly he turned and faced us. Our eyes lit
96 up as we recognized the driver. Although the last time we had seen him he was
97 upside down most of the time, Petrov defintly had features that were
98 unforgetable.
99 "Where to boys?", he asked in his best charlie chan imitation.
100 "To the Dragon Room", answered joshua, surprising the heck out of me.
101 "Does joshua know something that he isn't telling me?", I thought to myself, as
102 Petrov turned, and led us through the maze of twisty little passages, all
103 alike, in the direction of... The Dragon Room...

136 Proof positive on the pitfalls of uploads.  Voyer: sorry, I've already got
137 a girl in mind for the other half of the ticket (Someone I met at westercon,
138 as a matter of fact).
139     Speaking of westercon, how many of you were there?  Did I unknowingly
140 meet all of you?  Is there anyone going to worldcon this summer?  If not,
141 does anyone even have any information about it (I heard nothing about it
142 at westercon).  And even stranger, why has l'homme ignored my question as
143 to the color of his mustang?  Oh yes, one more thing, where is PC&S located?

149 Fast Fred: sorry about intruding into your message; I wanted to stick
150 my 2 cents in, and there was no more room.
151 If I had a choice, I'd take a girl, rather than a voyeur, too.
152 L'homme's car is blue.
153 Bard, apprentice, L'homme, Dream Toucher were at all of Westercon. I was
154 there Sunday, I hear Hawthorne was there Friday. Sounds like Petrov was there.
155 All: contrary to L'homme's message above, PorSFiS starts closer to 2:00.
156 Usually, however, it is 15 minutes late due to everyone standing around talking.
157 Usually around 3:30 +/- :30, it moves to PC&S, which is two blocks North.
158 (actually, a block and a half.  The library is at 801 SW 10th, and PC&S
159 is at 1038 SW Morrison, if that helps)
160 L'homme: Shame on you.  Lysias left a message just before you.  All you had 
161 to do was go back and look. (I know, you were so busy creating your great
162 on-line masterpiece that you forgot.  See what happens?)

185 you been smoking? Have you been going back to Nerd Central again?
186 Go back and look at my message. Re-read it carefully. There are no such errors
187 in it. No names mis-spelled. No times mis-quoted. Da de da da Da de da da
188 Fast Fred - I will now correct voyeur: It is a 1967 Ford Mustang - Acapulco
189 blue. With Good Year Eagle ST's, a black Vinyl top, PSU parking stickers in
190 the rear window, two 2.5 inch exhaust pipes handsomly turned down at the
191 rear valance, and NO, I repeat NO KGON or KRCK stickers on any interior or
192 exterior portion of the car. One more thing to remember, courtesy of
193 Jefferson High School, there are no original wire wheel spinner hub-caps.
194 %*@# high school!
195 Bard, Dream Toucher, Whisper, and I were there all five days. (I only saw
196 dream toucher in the Dr. Who video room on Tuesday. Were you at any of the
197 room parites? Voyeur did come Sunday, but he seemed to scare everyone away.
198 The only people who would talk to us were a group of punk rockers, one of
199 which had a silver face and a hairdo that looked like Bob Marley's. Were
200 you wearing any costumes? None of us did, but Bard and I, in our NET
201 personnas, did wear VOX headset walkie talkies on Friday, and I wore a
202 a semidisk shirt on Sunday, to complement my usual (as bard calls it)
203 preppy look of slacks and sweaters.
204 Are you going out with one of the Barbarian Women??? If so, lucky guy! I bet
205 they know how to treat a man(with A-1 sauce yuck yuck yuck)
206 I also carried a camera around a couple of the days, and I have quite a few
207 pictures of some of the bizzare costumes and happenings around there, including
208 the classic line "Friendship is Universal"
209 Are you signed up for RiskNet? I seem to recall you having some interest in
210 the game. Try to make it...By the way...how old are you, or more importantly,
211 how old do you look? No, I am not another Kim Flowers. It is due to the fact
212 that we meet in a tavern, with "No Minors Permitted". But, they don't seem
213 to enforce that rule too much, at least not yet. I keep expecting them to
214 come over and "card" everyone. I am 'only' 20, so I am one of those who 
215 would be thrown out. If you are of legal drinking age, then no problem. Just
216 thought I'd mention it.

248    Hovering in near-silence, wafting warm breath scented like cinammon
249 toast, the delicate violet wings glisten transluscently in the waning
250 evening light:  the dragon gazes down upon the Inn.  She undulates her
251 smoothly supple neck so as to obtain an unobtrusive angle upon the
252 happenings, and rainbow sprites glint off her crystal eye, reflecting
253 from the last rays of sun, and dart amidst the dusty tables...
A few
254 figures with hands clasped disconsolately around their mugs, heads
255 bowed, start at the spots of light, and some twist towards the window
256 that frames her finely-sculpted head, deep blue and purple.  But if
257 words are uttered from the dropped jaws, they are drowned by the boom
258 of the chatters' roar, the McKane playactors who appeared to have seized
259 the Inn by force, allowing no other voices to interfere with their dirt-
260 and-spy game.  Listening, the dragon rumbles in anger at this monopoly,
261 as her eyes probe the places where friends had relaxed once.  
The defiant
262 wheeze of the pipes cajole from one corner, and the Bard, noticing her
263 face soften as her eyes alight upon the small band, lifts his decantor
264 in salute.  But the back tables are in sad disarray, cluttered by the
265 long-winded and careless patrons that had passed there, and not a trace
266 of the dearly-missed Pam could she discover...
Hst!  Narrow eyes now
267 level upon her, for greedy, calculating hearts conspire her capture,
268 but she answers their outspilling thoughts with a hiss of contempt for
269 their oily guns and gawky machinery, their boorish paperback plots:
270 squabbling for the sake of excitement or for salvaging injured egos...
271 
So with a mighty surge of her wings, she scatters the playactors' memos
272 into the Backwater's hearth--the flames of which dash eagerly to devour
273 them--and at the same moment swoops in a graceful, climbing arch away
274 from these men who had besmattered her beloved Inn; like a fresh-sprung
275 arrow she soars, seeking the moon that hangs faded in the evening sky
276 as if it alone could bring her comfort.

282 --->Cthulhu: According to the archives in Dimat's PMP castle, you were destroyed in 743 C.Y. by himself, when he was
283 on HIS quest.  He possesses four of the original seven Elder Signs (three were destroyed), and R'lyeh is no more.  
284 You are just a figment of your imagination, so go away.  By the way, Hastur bit the dust, too.  As did Azathoth, 
285 Cthuga, Ithaqua, Nyarlathotep, and Shub-Niggurath.  Yog-Sothoth is a little difficult to destroy (he can be in several
286 places and times at once), but Dimat has installed a probability dampener on him, reducing his probability to about
287 a google to one.  Oh, by the way: All ththe Necronomicons have been burned, also.  Have a nice day in nonexistance.
288 --->After a long speech, one needs to write:
289 A weak torrent of silver flame brought Milchar to Earth, and he watched dismally as the magic quickly relapsed into
290 nonexistance.  "Can't do that for the return trip...  The bloody planet sucked up all of the magic.  No matter.  I 
291 must find some help."
292 Milchar looked about and found himself in an alley, marked with grafiti and strewn with chop-suey cartons.  A sign
293 above a nearby door read, "The Dragon Room - Back Entrance".  Checking the door, he found it locked.  Milchar 
294 straightened his robes, and put forth his will.  His argentium ring burst forth with a flood of silver, and he stepped
295 through the door...

304 THAT THE BIG BANG THEORY HAD SEXUAL CONNOTATIONS, AND THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NOTHING MORE THAN--WELL, THE RESULT OF THIS 
305 COSMIC COITIS.-----PROLOGUE-----------. DORUN WAS THE ONLY ORGANIC INHABITANT OF THE SINGLE REMAINING PLANET ORBITING A 
306 DWARPH STAR IN NGC 3.14. ( NGC 3.14 IN NEBULANIC BINARY TRANSAS
307 
308 LATED TO 'DIDDY WAH DIDDY' BUT THAT DIDN'T MATTER, SINCE NO ONE KNEW WHAT IT MEANT ANYWAY). ACTUALLY, THERE WERE OTHER 
309 ORGANIC BEINGS THERE, BUT THEY HAD ALL BEEN ASLEEP FOR 20 VARPTRS ( VERY AWFULLY REALLY LONG PERIOS OF TIME)-EVER SINCE 
310 THAT LITTLE GUY WITH THE MR. NATURAL BEARD INVITED THEM TO GO BOWLING, AND HAVE A DRINK FROM THE JUG HE CARRIED-, SO IT 
311 DIDN'T MATTER, AS FAR AS DO RUN WAS CONERNED--. NGC 3.14 WAS ONE OF THE FIRST GALAXIES TO BE FORMED BY THE "BIG BANG", 
312 AND WAS VERY FAR FROM THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE, AND SO WAS MOVING SO FAST THAT TIME HAD SLOWED DOWN CONSIDERABLY. THIS
313 WAS FINE, IF YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT GROWING OLD, BUT NOT SO GOOD, IF YOU HAPPENED TO OWN A CLOCK FACTORY, WHICH DIDN'T
314 MATTER, SINCE NO ONE DID---. MUSIC WAS A PROBLEM, THOUGH- DO RUN LIKED BILL HAILEY AS MUCH AS ANYONE, BUT WHEN IT TOOK 4
315 LONG PERIODS (VARPTRS) TO ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK----. GUSTAV MAHLER COULD TAKE A LIFE TIME-----.
316   DO RUN HAD BEEN EXILED FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND LONG PERIODS. HE DIDN'T REMEMBER HOW MANY, WHICH DIDN'T MATTER ANYWAY. 
317 ONCE EVERY FIVE LONG PERIODS, A SIBERGALAC TRANSPORT ARRIVED TO BRING HIM PROVISIONS, AND THE LATEST EDMUND SCIENTIFIC

334 L'homme - I see we have been visited by our long lost  d.  Judging from the
335 tone of her entry, she doesn't like our "boorish paperback plots", or
336 our "dirt-and-spy game".  While I don't hold my entries to be near the
337 quality of Pam's, Pam doesn't visit anymore, and  d  herself is
338 practically a stranger.  I would certainly step back and let her perform,
339 but since she chooses to be so elusive, I offer my own compositions.  They 
340 are, at least, better than a lot of what appears here these days.
341 d - I have been both a lurker and a participant since the days when
342 you and Pam, Tarn, Emer, and others (whose names I have forgotten since they have not been heard from for so long) were
343 active here.  I liked your writing.  However, it is hardly fair of you to desert the Inn for so long, then come
344 back and bemoan what has transpired in your absence.  If you choose to
345 join in again and help clean up and organize the Inn, then you would have
346 a right to complain.  I for one would be glad to have you back.  Perhaps if
347 you were to return, so too would Pam.
348 Now that I have antagonized all the old-timers, I'd better be off..

384 Insults Insults Insults...What is with these people? A while ago when there was absolutly nothing going on at the Inn,
385 people complained about the lack of any direction and the preponderance of those labeled with the moniker of "twits".
386 Now that most of the twits have cleared out of the inn, and the inn is no longer being ravished by giant ants and 
387 hi-tek weapons, and there is at least one story line making some progress, thanks to the efforts of Grand Dragon
388 Master and his call for some organization, we still get people who complain and bicker about. I don't see how 4 or 5
389 or so people can monopolize the inn when they usually only call once a day. There is plenty of
390 room for everyone. Why do people have such a need to complain about other's entries, and then do nothing to improve the
391 situation themselves? Wouldn't it be better to make an entry on some subject you would like to debate about, or start
392 another story that is more to your liking, than to belittle the other user's creations? That sounds so much more
393 productive, doesn't it?

491 d:Milady, I regret to inform thee that the doings of McKane and
492 those yclept "the NETwork are an improvement over what hath become
493 the common fare of this place. Many who try fantasy seem to confuse it with
494 that pastime known as "Dungeons & Dragons". They hack and slay thru others
495 adventures with no regard for wit and skill. 
496 They had even gone so far as to bring war to the Inn itself!
497 I regret that I cannot visit the inn as often as in the past. My duties
498 do not allow time for it on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and alternate Wednesdays! I
499 hope to see thee in the Inn. As I recall, there is a mug of thy favorite cider

526 Hi all, I'm back.  Lets get some good arguments going here.
527 As you all know, AT&T was recently broken up because it totally
528 monoplized the phone system.  It appears that some anti-trust legislation
529 was involved.  But, one great monopoly still exists!  Yes, that great
530 comglomerate ever bigger than AT&T.  The only one left.  and, it is...
531 
532 The US Govenment
533 
534 This monopoly has stood for 200 years, and it needs some airing
535 out.  Beat out the flies.  How about a system of several gov'ts, with
536 people choocing which one they want.  Dewl on it.  Post your opinions.

546 L'homme - now even Innkeeper is referring to our stories as a
547 "fetid field of manure."  Maybe I'll move on and leave them all to
548 the twits.
549 All - I don't know how many have discovered this method of builing the 
550 more elaborate borders, but for those who have not, observe:
551 start with a line of some easy to do character (usually with auto-repeat)
552      ...................................
553 then drop out of ENTER mode and get set to edit the just-made line;
554 change a portion of the line to what you want:
555    CH /..../|-:-/
556 and clean up the end.  The Change routine goes merrily through the entire
557 line, reproducing the pattern; like so:
558     |-:-|-:-|-:-|-:-|-:-|-:-|-:-|-:-|-:-|
559 Now you can liven up this fetid field of manure with pretty pictures.04:14:37   07/08/84

561 P.S. did you know that you don't have to use the slash as a delimiter in the
562 CHange command?  If you want the slash to be part of the change, use some 
563 other character, such as the question mark.
