25 To: Whoever told me about Forth   From: Tron  Re: Forth
26 
27    Could you tell me a little bit about Forth? What is it
28 basically based on? Strings, formulas or complex math? I am
29 mostly interested in languages that can be compiled; for speed
30 of course. I do machine language games and it REALLY becomes
31 tedious when I have to save source code, save machine code,
32 run machine code, load EDTASM, load source code and debug the
33 program.

37 To: those who have been following the misadventures of Mikey and
38 his putt-mobile in DEQ land.
39 
40 Let's see, it started several months back when the water pump
41 gave its last gasp. This resulted in a boiling mad engine.
42 The engine being of the aluminum type is not one to get mad at
43 you (it seems they hold a grudge forever). A couple of months later
44 after a new water pump and thermistat, that most feared letter of
45 the transportation society winged its way to my door stop; The
46 reregistration request. Knowing full well that it would fail, I took
47 the vehicle to the DEQ station to see ow badly things were. Sure
48 enough it was desperitly ill. I went to Shucks Auto to get a replacement
49 carburator since I knew that it was bad from the last episode of this
50 adventure. Now the fun really begins. The unit I got was so sloppy
51 that the idle would change by as much as 600 RPM every time you would
52 hit the gas. So.. back to Shucks.. Next unit could not get it to
53 stay the same air fuel mixture at idle it was VERY touchy and would
54 drift just looking at it. Oh my.. well, back to Shucks. They were a
55 bit more obnoxious this time "We don't sell bad carburators, Its your
56 engine." This despite me having spent $100.00 trying to get the thing
57 working at a dealership. So after a bit of complaining and screeming
58 on my part, they consended to replace it yet once more. By this time
59 I am become quite adept at replacing the carburator on a '75 Vega!
60 This unit was the most spectacular by far! It showered a fountain
61 of gas all over the engine. Off it comes tearing it open we discover
62 a baddly missadjusted float. Putting it back in after fixing that.
63 We find that the idle won't adjust to lower then 1000 RPM since the
64 max allowed is 1100 by DEQ this barely gets us under that part, But 
65 the real problem comes from it pouring an excessive amount of fuel
66 into the engine at high speed. Again it fails. O.K. back to the 
67 original carburator. Now another problem shows its head. The steering
68 wheel decides to come loose from its mounting. This being a tilt version
69 is not easy to fix. Cost $80.00. They also say that it will cost me
70 about $1000.00 to rebuild the engine to be able to pass DEQ. Or rather
71 excuse me, replace it (you cann't rebuild aluminum Vega engines).
72 So with this in mind and with a heavy heart I begin looking at possible
73 alternatives (I.E. a new car), but then I decide what the heck I still
74 have a week left to get the thing thru I might as well see what I can do.
75 So out come the tools and a bit of tweeking here and there. A pass at
76 DEQ and wonder of wonders IT PASSED! (I really think they just took
77 pitty on me, but who am I to argue!) So after 10 tries and $250.00 and
78 lots of wasted time, I now have a usable auto again well, sort of...
79 there's this metallic tapping sound under light load....... (sigh)

94 To Tron    Fm Adam Trent    Re  FORTH
95 It's hard to describe FORTH in a short space.  It's unlike the run-of-
96 the-mill languages you mentioned.  I'll quote Bill Ragsdale, one of the
97 original founders of the Forth Interest Group: "FORTH enjoys a
98 synergism of its features.  It has none of the elephantine character-
99 istics of PL/I or FORTRAN.  It has a density and speed far surpassing
100 BASIC, but retains an interactive nature during program development.
101 Since it is extensible, special words [commands] are easily defined
102 to give it the terseness of APL.  Its clarity and consistency result
103 from being the product of a single mind.  (as were PASCAL and APL)"
104   That single mind was Charles Moore who invented FORTH in 1969.
105   FORTH is extensible, easily debugged, powerful, transportable, and
106 compact.  It can include an interpreter, compiler, assembler,
107 operating system, and editor.  It might more aptly be described as a
108 complete computer utilization system rather than just a language.
109 In fact there is a growing family of FORTH-like languages:  STOIC,
110 CONVERS, PISTOL, FASL, and some others I can't recall right now.
111   The FORTH computer language builds upon itself. It's extensible.
112 A FORTH program is a set of increasingly powerful commands.  Each
113 command is built on those that have been previously added to the language.
114 The low run-time overhead for each command encourages modularity.
115   Changes to a program can be entered and immediately tested.  The
116 code produced is a special kind of code ("threaded code") that is 
117 interpreted by a supremely elegant threated interpreter.  FORTH code
118 can become more compact than even assembly code.  Performance is high.
119 Machine control is intoxicating!  It's structured.  You're in command.
120 It's quite unique.  Once you taste it, you'll laugh at people who still
121 plod along in FORTRAN, COBOL, PL/I, PASCAL, BASIC.  I program in these
122 only when I have to.  FORTH (and more recently STOIC) are my preferred
123 ways to make my computer do things for me and others.  FORTH is ideal
124 for games.  Many of the big arcade game makers use FORTH.
125   To find out more:  Try a book by Leo Brodie called "Starting FORTH".
126 I've seen it at B. Dalton's.  You might also send to the FORTH
127 INTEREST GROUP for info.  Their address is:
128     FORTH INTEREST GROUP, POB 1105, SAN CARLOS,  CA  94070

130 To Tron:
131 You ask what forth is. Have you ever used a HP calculator, the ones with
132 no "equals" key, but that use a stack? This is forth. It is small because
133 it is VERY simple minded. Extensible? It has to be, it is useless otherwise.
134 Since it doesn't have named variables, only locations on the stack, it 
135 coesn't need the fancy internal arithmatic necessary to find them. Atari
136 people often claim it is great, because for a long time it was the only
137 thing better than BASIC they had. It is faster than BASIC, because it is
138 a partial compiler, but slower than a real compiler as it is a partial
139 interpreter. It works well for writing simple games, or for anything that
140 has only a small number of variables.
141 If you can hack assembler, you are already far past it. 
142 However, it is also described not as a language, but as a religion. Being
143 an atheist, I must in principal avoid it. (I prefer C, BASIC, assembler,
144 and Pascal to it, in that order)( or even RPG) It is not in the same
145 category as PL-1, FORTRAN< or COBOL, as these are big machine languages,
146 and FORTH is a small machine language. However, try it, you might like it.
147 Good versions exist for trash 80's, including tape machines.
148 If you need extensible, use anything with XTEXT or #INCLUDE, which I think
149 anything except the teaching languages like BASIC or Pascal have. 
150 The problem with extensible is called non standard. Look at BASIC, and what
151 happened when it was extended. This is a problem in BASIC, because what you
152 see is what you get. With FORTH, you can replace the whole thing, and 
153 usually need to to run anything. (It's easy, though.)
154 Good luck, you might even learn to think backwards, and then you can use
155 FORTH.

157 PS, who was on BWMS from 5:30pm to 3:30 am last night? I couldn't get on
158 at all>
159 .....................................................................
160 B.A.D. That's funny, I was on from 7:30pm to 7:53pm. I don't
161 think that I stay up that late.
162 
163    Regarding calling a TRS-80 Trash, don't. The old versions
164 suck but the new versions are even better than before. I agree
165 that the old Model I's stink for operations but is has MANY
166 features that APPLES, VICS, COMMODORES and any other computer
167 using microsoft basic doesn't have. If you feel like it, go
168 ahead and call the TRS-80's tras but I'd prefer if you didn't.
169 I am a high supporter of the TRS-80.
170     Where can I get a copy of FORTH for the TRS-80 Model I
171 tape system? I'm really interested in new languages; I'm so
172 limited by BASIC, LISP and Z80 Machine langugage. I do have
173 a LISP interpreter for ALL microsoft machines. If anyone is
174 interested, nootify me. Thanks for all the help........

179 ...................................................
180 Tron: I'm not sure there is a tape-based FORTH. Lots of luck
181 looking for it.
182 	I am curious about the LISP interpreter you mentioned
183 Is it the one that one of the computer mags has been printing?
184 ______________________________Leonard_________________________
185 ????????????????????
186 With all the mention of diskless computers, here's my question:
187 Is there anyone out there who  1.  Once used a diskless compute
188 r.  2.  Has disk now.  3.  Considers the disks only a marginal
189 improvement.  
190 	I ask this because it appears that some people still don't
191 (or won't) admit that tape systems are inherently inadequate.
192 I've use both (though thank heavens, not recently!) and there
193 is no comparison!

205 Leonard,
206    BINGO! 80-MICRO has been publishing a 3-part article on LISP.
207 If you don't have a subscription to 80-MICRO, you are really
208 missing out on something big! The LISP interpreter 80-MICRO
209 published is really good. Does good housekeeping chores and
210 Believe it or not, It's quick! Tell me if you'd like a copy.
211 
212               Tron
213 ----------
214 Tron, not being a Radio Shack user, I don't keep up with 80-Micro. Is that
215 Lisp useable with other machines , e.g. CPM z-80's? You said "any Microsoft"
216 machine"; does this mean it is written in BASIC, or does it use direct calls
217 to the innards of the interpreter? How complete is it? Does sound interesting.
218    As to calling the TRS-80 machines by their nickname "trash 80", RS 
219 worked hard for that, it's common, and it's understood. Do you have a 
220 better way to pronounce "TRS"? The model 1 may be obsolete, but there
221 are still more of them out there than just about anything else, and it
222 is to this that the name applies. I only wish I could afford a model 100.
223 //////////////////////////////////B.A.D.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
224 I'm glad to see that someone else out there appreciates LISP.  While
225 I never use it anymore (lack of an interpreter) it is quite
226 useful and fascinating.
227 /////////////////
228 Hi, B.A.D...I still refer to my first system, and fondly so, as simply "the
229 Model One."  My 72-year-old dad and his bride have it now, having mastered
230 since Christmas the intricacies of the original Electric Pencil as they write
231 magazine articles of travel and special people they have met.  The EI is ol'
232 number 116; the twin Shugarts pre-date 40-track days...but they hain't seen
233 a Tandy test bench yet!  "Trash" if you choose, but not to me.
234 (*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*) Dave (*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)
235 B.A.D.,
236   Yes, the LISP interpreter is in BASIC. It has 48 different
237 commands. I don't know about it being "COMPLETE", but I'd call
238 it quite complete. All articles impress meV VERY much. With very
239 little modification (input/output and errors), It can run on
240 ANY microcomputer running in MICROSOFT BASIC. If you are
241 interested, give me a buzz on any of the Bulletin Board Systems.
242 Thanks......

291 tron,
292 	hi.  how's life?  I just finished re-formatting
293 most of my old disks that i never use.  i now have about forty
294 blank 45-track disks to use for anything i please.  when i get
295 another drive (about two weeks from now) i'll be happy.  i
296 think i'm gonna get rid of the one i have now and replace it
297 with two of the new 1/2 height tandon drives.
298 ----------------------------------ag------------------------
299 speaking of which, does anybody have an opinion on these
300 drives?  they look nice, and at the computer show at the
301 coliseum i noticed a lot of manufacturers using them in
302 their products.  if anybody knows anything about how they
303 compare to normal sized drives, please say something because
304 if they suck i don't wanna blow $200 on one.  can you really
305 stick two of 'em in a regular single drive case?  what about
306 a power supply; can you run two of them off one standard
307 power supply, or what?  what's the scoop here?
308 what step rates, seek times, stuff like that?
309 in short, are they as good or better than standard size drives?

328   DON'T SELL YOUR DISK DRIVE!!!!!! If you are going to sell
329 your disk drive, sell it to me! I need one BAD!!!! My father
330 needs it mostly for his mailing list and the printer he was
331 gonna buy. If you are selling your drive, how much? Call ya
332 later.....

334              Tron
335 ----------
336 Radio Shack's policies on service, outside software support etc.
337 have improved greatly (mostly in the last year!). On the other
338 hand Apple seems to be trying its best to alienate dealers & users!
339 ..............................................................
340 Tron: I may be interested in the LISP interpreter (I HATE typing
341 long listings!). I would like to take you up on the offer for
342 the lowercase driver but first I gotta explain a few things!
343 1. It's for my roommate's machine
344 2. He is NOT a computer whiz.
345 3. It's a "MEMORY SIZE" machine.
346 4. It has DEFINITE keybounce.
347 	A few ideas you might add to your driver...
348 (All taken from a Mod 3 driver patch I wrote. Source available
349 on request).
350 CTRL-1 (^1) redefined as \, ^2 as ], ^3 as ^, ^4 as _, ^5 as {,
351 ^6 as |, ^7 as }, ^8 as ~, ^9 as  ASCII DEL (chr$(127))
352 also Mod 3 uses ^, as ^\ (1CH), ^- as ^] (1DH), ^. as ^^ (1EH)
353 and ^/ as ^_ (1FH).
354 I have also defined ^; as a "super-shift", hit it and you change
355 mode from regular to graphics, graphics to special, or special
356 to regular (depending of course, on what mode you were in). The
357 cursor changes appropriately (so you don't have to remember
358 which mode you're in), it is an _ in regular, a graphics block
359 in graphics, & an inverse ? in special. I suspect that this 
360 would be a bit difficult to implement on a Mod 1 since they
361 don't have the special character set OR a programmable cursor!
362 _______________________Leonard________________________________
363 Tron -- if you get a copy of Brodie's "Starting Forth" and find it
364 interesting, you might drop by the next meeting of GOFIG -- the Greater
365 Oregon Forth Interest Group.  We meet the second Saturday of each month
366 at 1 p.m. at Bldg. 58, Tektroniks.  All levels of skill are represented
367 as well as MANY different machines.  Forth is NOT just a small computer
368 language -- it has been implemented on virtually EVERY computer currently
369 in use.  Once you get used to it, it is the easiest of all computing
370 environments in which to work -- and the major drawback of less speed
371 than machine code is obviated by the ease of dropping into assembler.
372 I can only suggest to all you skeptics, try it -- and stick with it long
373 enough to get past its "different" look/feel, and you just may like it.
374  
375 GOFIG is planning to have a booth at OMSI's Computer Fair this fall, so drop
376 by and take a look.               Pann McCuaig  632-xxxx (for more info)
377  
378 Adam Trent -- aven't seen you at GOFIG meetings lately.  Group is getting
379 somewhat more vital, and we even have a newsletter again.  Next meeting
380 will be July 9.  See you then?
381  
382 You really like STOIC better than Forth?  Are CODE words as easy?  What
383 about speed?  I heard it's only half the speed of FIG-Forth.  Also, is it
384 still 8080-specific?
385 Leonard,
386    Yes, the TRS-80 doesn't have a definable cursor but one
387 program I wrote allows you to have blinking/non-blinking 
388 user-definable cursor. But that used the expansion interfaces'
389 interrupts.
390    There is only one problem with the above you said. When
391 you print a chr$(8), it backspaces. But, the keyboard input
392 routine uses a chr$(8) for a backspace, not a DELETE. Also
393 the chr$(9) will be a problem also. Since the chr$(9) tabs
394 , that function must be deleted. So, why don't you just tell
395 me what ASCII codes mean what and I will assemble a nice
396 little keyboard/video lowercase driver with definable cursor.
397 I will also include a short debounce delay in it, if you wish.
398 Could we  talk on the CBBS instead? This system has to have you
399 type a CTRL-C and my terminal program is temporarily out of
400 commission. I am using Radio Shacks ULCBAS, which doesn't
401 produce control codes. Also, the lisp interpreter is not very
402 long if you look at it. Complex it is but it works like a
403 charm. What kind of machine do you own? If you own a Model III
404 could you tell me what address tells the cursor to blink/not
405 blink? Just a simple example would be sufficient. See ya....

412    Sarah and Fang? Love thoes names!!!! Here's another suggestion.
413 Take a few nice juicy cans of wet cat food and put it in a blender.
414 Take the amout of pills that you have cans and put it in the blender.
415 Put it on puree. Pour the food (crap) out of the thing and feed
416 it to the kitty. It worked on my Ambusher and I'm sure it'll
417 work on Sarah or Fang. Or you could givem' shots! My cat i
418 named Ambush. I named him that because thaT's exactly what
419 he does. When he was a kitten, I held out my hand towards him
420 and said" KITTY?", he looked up. I hissed and simulated a claw
421 with my hand. He pinned back his ears, arched his back, curled
422 up his tail and ran sideways at me. The cutest thing I ever did
423 see! If Sarah or Fang are kittens, try it!

428 To clear the air about the LISP interpreter, tron, you obviously have not
429 used it. It is not fast, and it is not complete. It is a nice way to
430 learn a little about lisp, but it is definitly not very useable for anything
431 big. A real LISP interpreter has well over 150 built in functions, and
432 as interpreters go, extremely fast. Hey tron, stop saying stuff about 
433 something you know nothing about!

456 
457   Okay, then, I must rephrase myself. It is fast for me. I
458 never have used LISP itself, nor tried to program it. I simply
459 typed in the listing that I had on hand and ran a few tests. It
460 does a remarkable job (especially in BASIC). 
461   When I say complete, I mean it is complete with ALL of the
462 standard commands. No frills or extra crud that an expert
463 programmer will need, but is good for learning. Sorry to anyone
464 I may have misleaded. Also, to someone above, don'T talk so
465 hostile to me. I didn't step on any toes. Why didn't you just
466 tell me I was making a mistake? I would have admitted my errors.

470 Why does this sytem bring out the hostile in people? Is it because we 
471 can hide under our non-names?
472 Tron: ignore the hostiles (or just say what you think of them).
473 How long is that LISP interpreter? I would like to try it.
474 Sara and Fang are not kittens, but have many years and several batches
475 of kittens behind them. They are both neutered (Sara just). There is no
476 hiding the flavor of Sara's pills;they will spoil anything!
477 Perhaps CBBS is right in not allowing aliases, or do they just police it
478 better? 
479 A real cheap way to get into FORTH is in the Oct 1981 DR.Dobb's Journal.
480 It's a simple forth interpreter written in BASIC. SLOW. About 200 lines
481 of basic code, I think. I have a copy if you have a way to get it off
482 Heath discs or tape.(modem, prehaps)
483 Dr. Dobb's is a good source for enough forth to get a feel for it, though
484 you really need Brody to get the hang of it.

488 ****************************************Hello there all,
489 I just witnessed the most barbaric phenomenon...
490 the tough man contest at the Tigard Armory on this night
491 of 6/23/83. The contestants had little monetary gain.
492 The crowd was jeering the losers and cheering the
493 heaviest punches. And you know what? several of them
494 were "laid out". And you know what else? It was great!!
495 This was for real...no games...it is hard to explain...
496 but let's have some input on this obviously barbaric
497 debabcle blow to morality....not for one side or the
498 other as always...Shibumi
499 ***************************************
500 B.A.D,
501   Lemme see.... The LITHP interpreter is about 300 lines long the
502 way it looks from my viewing. It has atoms and complete basic
503 operation. I'd really be interested in that FORTH interpreter.
504 If It's so slow, I'd turn it into machine language. Is it in
505 MICROSOFT basic? If so, could you type it into this system?
506 or would you rather just download it to me? Talk to ya later....

535 The way I have gotten the most recalcitant cat to take medicine:
536 1) hold cat by throat
537 2) force cat's mouth open with thumb andfinger,
538 3) toss pill to back of mouth, force down with finger if ness.
539 4) have cat declawed and hands sutured.

542 Shouldn't you have the cat declawed BEFORE you try to get it to take medicine?

545 	Does the Lisp run under CP/M or TrashDos?  Hmmmmmmmm?

552 SMURF,
553 break
554 Having had experience with a new Mod 4 and TRSDOS 6.0, I can't
555 say enough good stuff about it.  Ya think Tandy is finally
556 getting their act together?  I've heard nice things about the
557 Mod 16 and Xenix, too.  Isn't is a true UNIX system licensed
558 by Bell Labs?
559 	Anyway, one question about the mod 4:
560 Why  didn't they use a green phosphor screen?
561 :::::::::::::::****************::::::::::::::::::**************
562 Yes, the LITHP runs under ANY DOS. To sumone above:
563 Raido Shack likes to spend as less money as they can. Since the
564 green screens cost more, they didn't want to do that. But, In
565 the near future, they will be putting out a green screen to fit
566 over the top of the screen they currently have now. Yes, the
567 XENIX is an EXCELLENT prototype of UNIX. Does a mighty fine job
568 if you ask me. I kinda wish I had a model 16 myself. That's the
569 next computer I'm gonna buy.
