25   Colors wound round the piper and the pegasus.  A slight chill brought goose
26 bumps to his naked shoulders (it seemed eternities since he had abandoned his
27 blood-soaked shirt).  A broad band of blood was slowly oozing down his right
28 side, coming out through his unbroken skin in a pattern matching the oozing
29 slashes on the pegasus' side.  The winged catlike carnivore was revolving,
30 weightless, on its own axis, the piper and the pegasus revolving slowly, linked
31 together by the piper's arms about the pegasus' neck.  In one hand, the piper
32 cluutched a pole, about three inches in diameter near the wad of roots and 
33 dirt where it had been torn from the earth, and tapering to about two inches
34 where it had long ago been broken into jagged splinters.  The piper was aware
35 of the soft skin of the pegasus against his chest and arms -- soft as silk
36 in the direction the hairs lay, sharp and prickly against the grain.  Her 
37 heart beat strong and steady -- he knew that she had lost much blood, and with
38 it strength -- her sweat coated his skin with froth and brought added chill.
39   He gave very little thought to this, however.  His eyes were tight on the
40 slowly revolving carnivore, stunned by that desperate blow of her hooves.
41 He knew that if the winged cat was not discouraged by that last setback, his
42 life as well as the pegasus' would be caught in the ensuing struggle.

52      The  continuing  saga of Tarn reminded me of a story I had  heard  a 
53 long  time  ago,  after much searching I finaly found it,  it is  an  old 
54 English tale. The author has long since been forgotten;
55      It  was  winter,  and a solitary man wandered the  hills,  his  gait 
56 shambling and slow.  Once he had been comely, but now his bones stretched 
57 the  pale skin of his face,  and his eyes were sunk in shadows.   The man 
58 had been brought to this pass by an encounter during the spring.  
59      The land was blooming then.  The meadows were carpeted with primrose 
60 and heartsease, and the air was laden with the sent of lavender. 
61      One  bright  morning,  he set out for the Inn.   He rode briskly  at 
62 first,  but  the  country  roads  were  warm  and  quiet,  save  for  the 
63 blackbird's  song  and the echoing notes of the cuckoo.   Soon the  man's  
64 horse slowed to a walk. The man rode on drowsily dreaming.
65      After  some  time,  his reverie was broken by a fluttering  movement 
66 near an oak beside the road.   He spoke, but no one replied.  Curious, he 
67 dismounted and strode to the tree.  
68      "Come out," he said.  A trill of laughter was the only reply.  "Come 
69 out," he called again.   A woman stepped lightly into the road and  stood 
70 before  him.  She seemed clothed with the dawn,  for her clothes were the 
71 color of rose petals,  and she was crowned with a cascade of fiery  hair.  
72 She  met  the  man's  gaze  with green cats eyes as  shy  as  any  forest 
73 creature's, and in that instant the man was lost. 
74      Without  speaking a word,  he held out his arms to the  woman.   She 
75 came quite willingly,  it seemed,  and he lifted her to the saddle of his 
76 horse.   In  a  language he could not understand,  she  wispered  to  the 
77 animal,  which turned obediently from the road and,  with the man walking 
78 alongside,  threaded its way through the trees and into the sunny meadows 
79 that lay beyond.
80      They  traveled  thus for hours,  now in a field and now in  a  shady 
81 forest.   From  time  to time,  the lady spoke softly.   The  man  picked 
82 wildflowers  for her,  and with nimble fingers,  she fashioned them  into 
83 garlands for her blazing hair.  
84      When the sun stood high in the heavens, she began to sing, weaving a 
85 net  of melodies around the man who walked beside her.   She leaned  from 
86 the  saddle  and  peered  into his eyes with a  look  of  such  absorbing 
87 tenderness that he could not speak for longing.  
88      At last, when the afternoon was well advanced, the lady spoke a word 
89 in her strange tongue,  and the horse halted in a small elder copse.  The 
90 man  lifted her from the saddle and looked again into her  face.  He  saw 
91 inexpressible  sadness.   Tears glistened in the green eyes and glittered 
92 on the lashes.   The man kissed the woman then, but she drew herself from 
93 his arms and once more began to sing. 
94      Light as the morning mist, the voice coiled around him, and his eyes 
95 grew heavy.   He swayed and sank to the ground.   He saw for a moment the 
96 rosy clothes of the lady and her bright red hair, swinging as she bent to 
97 watch  him.  Above her head the canopy of leaves wheeled.  He closed  his 
98 eyes.  
99      As he slept,  he dreamed of darkness.   He saw a line of men haggard 
100 and gray in death.  Their gray lips were split over gaping black  mouths,
101 and  shadows  filled  their empty eye sockets.  The lips  moved,  and  he 
102 realized  that  the ghostly figures were calling his  name.   Their  bony 
103 fingers waved, summoning him.
104      He  awakened bathed in icy sweat,  staring up through the leaves  at 
105 the stars.  He was alone.  He sighed and closed his eyes and slept again.
106      Dawn  came,  and the man woke again with a premonition  of  dreadful 
107 grief.  The woman was gone,  having taken his heart from his breast.   He 
108 knew that she had left him as surely as if he had seen her die.   He knew 
109 from then on, every hour would be achingly empty.  His fate had come upon 
110 him,  a  life full of yearning that never would be satisfied,  of calling 
111 and hearing no reply.
112      Sick with desire, he rose and searched. He hunted through the copse, 
113 but found no sign of the woman.  He searched the meadows, following every 
114 path and byway, and still he found no sign.
115      So that day passed,  and the next,  and the next.  The flowers faded 
116 in the fields,  the harvests were gathered in and the birds ceased  their 
117 singing.   Still the man wandered, a gaunt figure silhouetted against the 
118 winter sky, a man bereft of hope but not of longing.
119      At last he could walk no farther.  He lay down on the  bracken.  The 
120 final  sounds he heard were the moan of the wind and the hoarse cries  of 
121 quarreling rooks.
122      When the villagers found him, they said little.  But, when they were 
123 safe in their homes again, they wispered of fairy enchantments and of the 
124 ranks of mortals who were victims of fairy love.  They spoke with fear as 
125 mortals often did when they talked of the powers of Faerie.

150 "Well, Mr. Farley, how would you like to work for the NET?"
151 I was in shock.  The NET wanted me?
152 "Why?  What would I do?"
153 "You would do as you have been doing, looking for Joshua.  Only you'd bring him
154 here, not to your former employers."
155 "Won't that make them mad?"
156 "Probably.  Believe me, they can't do anything to you even if they wanted."
157 It sounded good, but still I wondered.  I used the old line, "What's in it for
158 me?"
159 "Resources, and a suitable sum of currency.  The amount will be based on the
160 job, contract basis.  Do you agree?"
161 Hell, why not.  "Agreed.  First, where's the XD-40?"
162 The gentlemen left, and soon returned with the weapon.  "Right here, Mr.
163 Farley.  Joshua was last seen in Portland, at 10th and Taylor.  Got that?"
164 "Sure.  Just show me the way out."
165 I was led through a maze of corridors (all alike) and given an identification
166 card.  "Here's the lift, Mr. Farley.  Good luck."
167 In a flash, I was back up in the empty lot.  Fred hadn't budged.
168 "Farley!  Are you all right?  Where were you?"
169 "I'm okay, Fred.  I just had a little visit with the NET.  Nothing to worry 
170 about."   Yet.
171 "Do you know, then, where to go now?"
172 "Yeah.  10th and Taylor.  No rush, though.  I have to get a motel room first."
173 "Ah, er, your employers run a hotel a few blocks from there, Farley.  Perhaps
174 they would give you free lodging."
175 "FORMER employers.  No, I think I'll skip that one.  Find another.  I'm beat."

178      "Well, how are we feeling today?"  I looked up at the speaker and grinned.
179 "Good as new, Cameron."  He scowled at me.  "'Doctor Bangs', please.  Let's
180 try to maintain a modicum of professionalism here.  And as the doctor, may *I*
181 make the determination of your fitness?"  As he set about examining my
182 frostbit extremities, I reflected on how lucky I had been to have been
183 transferred here to Willamette Falls.  The rescue team that found me took me
184 to the hospital in Mattress,  but they threw up their hands in despair when
185 they saw my condition.  They decided the only place that could do anything
186 for me was Willamette Falls, and Dr. Bangs, who was a well-known expert
187 on cold-related injuries.  (I think another reason they didn't want to keep
188 me was that the anti-'neeshie feelings were running high in the area, and they
189 feared for the safety of both me and their hospital.)
190      "Well, I guess I must second your opinion," Dr. Bangs told me when he
191 finished poking and prodding my anatomy.  "As far as I'm concerned, you're
192 ready to go.  How is Dr. Abraham doing with your memory?"  "I'm afraid things
193 are about the same there," I reponded quietly, my pleasure in our friendly
194 banter suddenly lost.  "I see faces but no names, scenes without even
195 subtitles, and I DON'T REMEMBER WHO I AM!"  I bit off the words, and turned
196 and looked out the window, trying to regain my composure.
197      The good doctor offered a few token words of comfort, but finally left.
198 He was good at healing the body, but his skills at healing the psyche were not
199 so well developed.
200      I sat there, staring out the window, not seeing what I was looking at,
201 wallowing in self-pity.  Wondering who I was, what I had done.  I looked at my
202 hands, examined the scars from the freezing and resultant surgery, the
203 callouses from my hidden past.  I flexed the fingers, enjoying the lack of pain
204 and the restored agility.  If only the mind could be healed so easily.
205      Tiring of the pointless and frustrating introspection, I got out of bed
206 and headed for the lounge.  What I needed was some human contact.
207 Arriving, I discovered no one there.  Oh yeah, they were all at the Christmas
208 pageant.  Bah humbug.  I definitely wasn't in the mood for that.
209 I dropped into a chair, and picked up a several-day-old newspaper.  Desultorily
210 flipping the pages, an article suddenly caught my attention.
211 "The Cast of NET....
212       ....NET agents L'homme and Gaudy Minsky......
213       ....Joshua..."
214 joshuajoshua  joshua ua josh oshua... the name rang through my head, shaking
215 loose disjointed images of people and places.  Suddenly I knew who L'homme sans
216 Parity was, and Gaudy Minsky, and most importantly, I KNEW WHO I WAS.
217 Joshua, the article had named me.  Yes, at that time I had been Joshua.
218 However, that had not been my first identity.  I barely remembered the name
219 I had been born with, and I doubted if even the almighty Ian MacHinery knew it.
220 I realized now what had happened.  The pressures of the interrogations at the
221 commune, the life-threatening struggle in the wilderness, the loss of control
222 while under anesthetics here at the hospital, these had all combined to trigger
223 the post-hypnotics implanted by the NET to maintain their security.
224 As it turned out, the suggestion had been somewhat faulty, and that unique
225 individual *I* had been restored by references in the newspaper.
226 Rather fortuitously in this case, since there were no NET shrinks handy to
227 bring me back, but I'd have to let Ian know that his technique wasn't 100%.
228      Oh yes, NET.  I finished reading the article, and sat there puzzled.
229 According to this Woodward character, NET was no longer active.  This did not
230 jibe with what I knew about them, as NET was not a government agency, and even
231 such successful snoops as Jack Anderson should not have been able to find out
232 anything about them.  Unless.....  yes, it was undoubtedly a planted leak.
233 After all the noise created by the McKane thing, they had had to get out of the
234 public eye somehow, so they 'disbanded'.  They probably reorganized their
235 branch offices, but the core organization would still be intact.
236 Now, how to find them....?
237 ...............................................................................
238 THE CLACKAMAS COUNTY REVIEW -
239      Police still have no clues on the whereabouts of the 'John Doe', who
240 disappeared from the Willamette Falls Hospital two nights ago.  Clackamas
241 County Sheriff spokesman Noah Commente told the REVIEW, "Yeah, he was the
242 'neeshie that escaped from their commune down there in RAINdeer.  He was purty
243 badly frostbit, and didn't even remember his name.  Them damn' commies prob'ly
244 practiced their brainwashing tricks on the poor fella.  Anyway, it seems he
245 snuck into the doctors lounge and stole a set of clothes, then took off in
246 the doc's car.  Poor guy was probably outa his head, after what he'd been
247 through.  We're all lookin' for him, and we expect to find him and the car
248 soon."  When asked if the man was considered dangerous, detective Commente
249 replied, "Naw.  The guy's prob'ly wacko, but the doctors here say he's
250 harmless."  Spokesmen for the hospital had no comment.
251 ..........................
252 THE CLACKAMAS COUNTY REVIEW -
253      Sergeant Noah Commente, former spokesman for the Sheriff's office, offered
254 a public apology yesterday to the Dangerfield commune of RAINdeer.
255 Sergeant Commente had made "slanderous and unsubstantiated statements" to the
256 press about the commune, according to commune spokeswoman Ma Prem Rivers,
257 while he was commenting on the disappearance of a former commune member
258 from the Willamette Falls Hospital.  Commente could not be reached for an
259 interview, and the Sheriff's office had no comment pending the outcome of
260 the internal affairs investigation.
261 ................................................................................
262      After 'escaping' from the hospital (I hated to treat them so shabbily
263 after they had been so kind, especially Dr. Bangs, but now that I had my
264 memory back, I couldn't afford any questions), I ditched the car in the
265 Clackamas River near the North Fork dam, and caught a ride back to Oregon City
266 with a returning fisherman, and then thumbed my way to downtown Portland.
267 There, I flopped with some of the street people I had met in the commune.
268 Now, a week later, I was ready to move.  I had made contact with the 'criminal'
269 underground and obtained needed equipment, scouted out the relevant buildings,
270 and everything was set.  Everything, that is, except disk space.
271 As this has gone for almost 100 lines, you'll have to wait for the next
272 exciting installment.
273      (with apologies to Doctor Cameron C. Bangs, MD)

275 PS - Farley: please don't find me yet, I've still got some things to do.
276                               Thanks, Joshua.

279   Omega lifted one black and sopping boot onto the next step, trying wearily to
280 make it to the top of the flight of stairs. Water poured in streams from the
281 gaping slashes in the sides of his boots. Slashes made by sharpened roots, and
282 other things submerged below the blackened green waters of Louisiana bajous.
283 
284   It had been three days on foot since Omega had entered the swamps. It was
285 nearly impossible to find Doctor Lloyd's laboratory from the air, even with
286 compass points. Something to do with heavy magnetic distortions from metalic
287 ores under the swamps, anyway...
288   As the Omega stepped onto the highest step and started looking at where in the
289 hell he was, it was a shock to see flourescent lamps, tiled floors, especially
290 glassware. Civilization, thought Omega, this is where I belong.
291 
292   As if to finish off the joke, Omega stepped into the small laboratory and
293 started dohn the halls, trying to find the restroom.
294   Turning one corner, he bumped into a small round nursing attendant, who made
295 a really annoying shreik after one long look at him. Somehow, Omega expected her
296 to faint, after all that is the way it all happened in the movies. Was it not?
297   She righted herself, and stood straightly for a minute. ssibly pondering if
298 she ought to try for the alarm.
299   Omega stuck out a moss stained arm, and opened his hand to reaveal a Net
300 indentification card. She seemed calmed by this.
301 
302   "I assume you want to speak to Doctor Lloyd?" She said obviously trying to
303 make up for being scared by praising Lloyd.
304   "I have some questions about possible mind blocks on the higher up's." Omega
305 had a theory. What if Joshua's mind block about security protection had failed,
306 it was entirely possible Joshua it was a mindless zombie somewhere. If he it was, at
307 least they would know. At least they would stop wondering.

309    Petrov sat in his car across from the empty lot.  It had been at least an
310 hour since the man he'd been following disappeared while examining an empty can.
311 There was something familiar about this address.  Hmmmm...  Oh yeah!
312 Petrov smiled widely.  Joshua had told him about this empty lot.
313 			{fade to memory sequence}
314 		  {place: Dragon room torture chamber}
315    "Why me?  Upside-down again!"  Petrov was suspended over a bed of hot coals.
316 He eyed Joshua and L'homme.  "Why do you guys get to be righ-side up?"
317    "Can't you see we're talking here?"  Irritation was plain in Joshua's voice.
318 L'homme had ben talking to Joshua in one of the NET's secret languages.  Petrov
319 wished he had paid more attention in his "NET secret language" class he had
320 taken at the McKane Academy.  He DID understand most of the conversation, 
321 though.  Since McKane knew about this language, it had to be one of the older 
322 and simpler ones.  Petrov dismally scanned the room while keeping an ear on the
323 discussion.
324    "...and there's these two guys who like to pretend they're NET agents,"
325 L'homme said.  "They operate out of an empty lot in Portland."  Both men
326 laughed.  "It's a pretty popular joke among our NET operatives.  I remember this
327 time they took a man off the street, showed him around their hideout, and sent
328 him on some fool mission!"  The pressure of the situation made the story seem
329 funnier than it really was.  The captives laughed hysterically.
330 Suddenly their laughter was cut short by a strange rumbling noise; a corner
331 of the room caved in.  A Tank?
332    "Ian!  We were just starting to have fun in here..."
333 
334    Petrov snapped back to the present.  Last he knew, the NET was considering
335 taking over the elaborate empty lot for their own purposes.  That was about five
336 months ago.  Petrov decided he'd have to talk to an OFFICIAL NET agent to
337 discover whether or not they had done so.
338    Petrov was confused and intrigued.  "I wonder who that captured man is REALLY
339 dealing with?  NET?  Psychopathic pseudo-spies?  Hmmmm."

428 MiG and Sondargaard: Prometheus has told me that you feel I was unfair in my criticism of teenagers out on dates in 20' 
429 tall 4x4s. If you would drop me a line on either this system or Le Nerd, perhaps I could explain myself.
430   Until next time, May your gods be with you, stringing happiness throughout your life time, And I hope you had a wonde
431 rful Christmas season.

436 Ye gods, what a tangled web we weave... and on a Christmas day.
437 #$##$##$##$##$#
438 I rested quietly in my room, pondering events.  Things were not as they seemed.
439 I wondered who really did what to whom and when, and most importantly, if 
440 anything was done to me.  I needed Fred to help me straighten things out.
441 "Fred?  Farley here.  Anything on that ID card the NET gave me?"
442 "Yes, Farley.  It was made by mail-order by a novelty shop in Portland.
443 I'm afraid the people you were dealing with were phonies."
444 Great.  I'm going to have to stop waking up to such great news in the morning.
445 "And John?  Did you contact him?  I have this funny feeling they messed around
446 with the XD-40.  Seems okay, but..."
447 "No luck.  He seems to have disappeared.  Have you seen today's paper?"
448 "Why?"  I really wasn't in the mood for hearing about the latest war in the
449 middle east.  "Anything special?"
450 "Just that a man escaped from a hospital not too far from here.  He matches
451 Joshua's discription, and he was treated after exposure to extreme cold.
452 Remember the snow near RAINdeer?" (Yes, I have changed the reference. EF)
453 Could it be?  Wait, hold it just a second here.  Who do I bring him to now?
454 I don't like or trust the Beeshies.  I definitely don't bring him to anyone 
455 that passes out false ID cards...  Who, then?
456 ...............the Real NET?
457 "Fred, get warmed up.  First, we find John.  I want this thing examined.  Next,
458 we get you fitted with some more gear.  I have had this strange feeling of 
459 being followed.  Then we find out more about the NET, but this time I mean the
460 *REAL* NET.  If it exists at all, but the doubt is getting less all the time.
461 Lastly, we find Joshua, and bring him to whoever I trust at the time.  Got all
462 that?"
463 "I think so.  Farley, I've been working on your first name now for quite some
464 time now, but I have still had no luck.  Won't you tell me?"
465 "What brought this on?"  This car was acting stranger all the time.  Hey, wait,
466 this thing is a machine.  Stop thinking of it as human.
467 "I...just need to be successful at something.  I've bungled nearly all of the
468 jobs you gave me.  I want to do something right, even if I have to ask you.
469 What is your first name, Farley?"
470 "Ok, ok.  It's Eugene.  Now be quiet, and let's get to John's shop."
471 "Farley-", Fred began.
472 "Yeah, now what?"  I was getting a mite irritated by this time.  I don't 
473 believe I just told this stupid thing what my first name was.
474 "I've found out what your name is.  It's Eugene."
475 Great, I thought, it's redundant too...
476 #$##$##$##$##$##$##$# Farley #$##$##$##$##$##$##$# 12/25/84 - 08:42, Merry Xmas
477 Hey, anyone:  is Nerdolux back up?  If so, why is it IMPOSSIBLE to get on?
478                                             Curiously yours, FF

483        Wondering Why===================
484 The vehicle came in for a landing at NET headquarters. It's appearance and
485 means of propulsion would have astonished onlookers, that is if it's owner
486 had _allowed_ the onlookers to perceive it.
487 	Before stepping onto the roof, he checked the contents of his pack.
488 Yes, everything was there. He closed the pack and approached the entrance.
489 	Eluding the guards took but a fraction of his attention. He thought
490 about his mission as he strolled towards the resident agents' quarters. The
491 NET prided itself on being considered mythical. To HIM that was laughable.
492 He chuckled at the thought.
493 	He normally worked at night, but for people whose schedules were as
494 erractic as his "targets", he would make an exception.
495 	He entered the apartments as if they were unlocked. In each he
496 secreted items from his pack. None of the sleeping agents stirred. Not even
497 the notoriously light sleeper, L'Homme!
498 	He left as quickly, and silently as he had entered. Any observer
499 would have been hard put to put believe how little time he had needed. But
500 then, he was a professional. He'd been doing this sort of thing for AGES.
501 	As he left, he consulted a list. Ah, yes, Petrov! As he drove off
502 he set a box marked "Fredrick's of Hollywood" on the seat next to him.
503 	............................
504 	We shall observe the discovery of only one of tne "surprises" that
505 he has placed.
506 	.............................
507 	Ian awoke with a feeling that something was not quite right. He
508 arose carefully, checking for danger before each move. He began a slow
509 careful search of the room...
510 	There! That package! It hadn't been there when he went to sleep.
511 Ian knew better than to do as movie heroes often do and plunge the package
512 into a tub of water. Too many bombs would DETONATE when the water reached
513 the wiring. He did not call for help, anyone who could get a package into
514 his room WHILE HE WAS IN IT could have rigged the door or phone. 
515 	He'd deal with the package first, then the door, then the phone.
516 .....
517 	Sometime later, he had finished opening the package. All it contained
518 were a tape, a book and a card....
519 	 the BOOK! It was a copy of Machiavelli's "The Prince". Ian had been
520 meaning to get a copy, but had never had the time...
521 	He checked it carefully...
522            no, just a book. Hmmm. Someone had picked a strange way to 
523 deliver a present?
524            He set the tape aside after determining that it, too was safe.
525          .......... that left the card....
526               ... this side was blank...
527                He picked it up and turned it over...
528                            
529 		Merry Christmas, Ian. 
530 			I thought you might like the book. The tape
531 		is only 18 minutes, but you and the NET
532 		should enjoy it. 
533 				S. Claus
534                                                                            
535 	IT COULDN'T BE! Could it? He threaded the tape into a player. 
536                A few minutes later he turned off the tape, ashen-faced, 
537 and poured himself a drink. 
538 	It HAD to be real! Who else could have a copy of the the "missing
539 eighteen minutes"? Ian shook his head.

549 Ian - was that *REALLY* you!?  I'm amazed!  You _Never_ leave such 
550 elaborate & lengthy entries.  Has the 'Deus ex Machina' become rusty?
551 Far out!   And Yes, Joshua and Petrov will be in attendance.
552 ------
553 Farley - we were going to suggest that you could 'selectively' ignore
554 whatever didn't fit with your visualizations, but I see we were too late.
555 Petrov tried to leave it open for you, but a subsequent author was not 
556 quite so cooperative. So sorry.  You managed to roll with it well, though.

558 NET BRIEFING NET BRIEFING NET BRIEFING NET BRIEFING NET BRIEFING
559 According to authorities on mind control and disinformation, the best 
560 subjects for brainwashing are not, as one would expect, the weak, the
561 stupid, or the renegade. On the contrary, people with discipline, intell-
562 igence, and loyalty are the best targets. They have a capacity for ideal-
563 ism and enough of an attention span to absorb the new system , to let it 
564 completely supplant the old.
565 Whoever controls these things in Dangerfield's organization saw immediately
566 that Agent L'homme was too cynical and Agent Minsky too utterly disorgan-
567 ized to be good subjects, but saw in Agent Joshua all of the qualities
568 desirable in a willing malleable intelligence. Indeed, we recognized these
569 characteristics   ourselves when we first recruited him and gave him
570 NET training. It is not clear to us what the 'Neeshies have implanted in 
571 his mind, but we are fairly sure that, if he is aware of it on a
572 conscious level, he knows too much to be safe.
573 And we don't know how much of our own training has become...inoperative.
