20 FRANK: PART OF THE REASON WHY YOU GOT THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE IS BECAUSE THE
21 SUBJECT YOU PRESENTED IS BASED ALMOST ENTIRLY ON EMOTIONAL ISSUES. AS
22 MUCH AS BOTH SIDES TRY TO JUSTIFY IT VIA SCIENTIFIC BACKING, IT UP COMES
23 DOWN TO WHAT IS SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR. THIS IS NOT TO SAY I AGREE
24 WITH THAT SORT OF BEHAVIOR, BUT NONE THE LESS, IT IS STILL A SOCIALLY SET
25 UP THING, IT IS NOT AN INBORN TRAIT, THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY EVIDENCE 
26 PRESENTED WHICH INDICATES THIS. THE OTHER REASON THOUGH AS TO WHY YOU
27 DID NOT RECEIVE AT LEAST SOME WELL THOUGHT OUT ARGUMENT IS SIMPLY THAT
28 THE DEBATERS ARE CURRENTLY NOT HERE. PAM, HROTHGAR, DOM, CYM, DEBORAH, AND
29 OTHERS THAT I AM SURE I AM FORGETTING HAVE GONE ON TO OTHER THINGS. BWMS IS
30 CURRENTLY BEING USED BY A GROUP WHO ARE INTO SPY/VIOLENCE FANTASY STORIES
31 THUS THEIR RESPONSES BY THE VERY NATURE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IS GOING TO
32 BE EMOTIONALLY BASED. 
33 OTHERS: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BAN AGAINST HIGH TECH IN OR NEAR THE INN?
34 REMEMBER, THE INN IS IN A MEDIEVAL SETTING SURROUNDED BY FORRESTS WITH
35 A ROAD LEADING NORTH SOUTH, AND ANOTHER LEADING EAST WEST. THE EAST/WEST
36 ROAD LEADING TO THE MOUNTAINS, WHILE THE SOUTH ROAD LEADS TO A CITY
37 THAT SEEMS TO BE A BIT MORE MODERN. WHILE THE NORTH ROAD LEADS TO 
38 WASTE LANDS. THE INN IS ACCESSEDFROM THESE CROSS ROADS VIA THE FOOT BRIDGE.
39 THE STREAM WHICH FLOWS UNDER THE BRIDGE HAS NOT BEEN WELL DEFINED AS
40 TO DIRECTION OF FLOW, BUT APPEARS TO BE NW TO SW.

43 Grand D.
44      I think I might be able to help you out with this rabble known as
45 the NET.  They don't seem very impressive to me.  More a bunch of amateurs
46 playing with secret codes and cloak and dagger games than anything else.
47 Have you any direction in which you would like to move.  There seems
48 to be little substance in your conflict with them.
49      I only hope that Salazar doesn't get involved.  He's always been
50 a do-gooder.  I like him, but he's always getting in my way.  As for d
51 perhaps Serena should stay in the shadows for a while.  I'm sure if she
52 started kicking ass and taking names, it would bring out the Dragon
53 in the Dragon Lady.
54      Let me know your plan of action.

60     "   I'm really touched by the offers of your help.  You won't 
61 regret  your actions,  no sir.   Whisper,  contract sounds  fine.  
62 We'll steal some money up for you. "
63     He turned to Dawg and whistled and the animal lumbered over.
64     "   Good boy.   Archer would you get out the contents of  his 
65 back  pack,  and lay them out on the table for me.   Here is  the 
66 layout  of the major holes for dimesional travel.   Here we  are, 
67 and  right above that mustard stain is the portal for  Blackpool.  
68 Whiteliner,  could  you look through the first volume of  submaps 
69 for traveling. "
70     Whiteliner   sorted   through   the   pages   of   maps   and 
71 advertisements  til  he came apon the map for the Inn  area.   He 
72 noticed that the Inn was surrounded  by portals. 
73     "   Anybody  her smoke?  I can't anymore,  so  would  someone 
74 please take that pipe, light up, and blow some smoke over here. "
75     The  smoke created a atmosphere where Morby  could  determine 
76 the  locations of things with the the help of the reference maps, 
77 and  even  sometimes alter their position.   He had a  hard  time 
78 concentrating  over  the  sound of  loud  coughing and   weezing, 
79 but he was able to determine the mode of transportation in  which 
80 the  Band of Not Altogether Very Merry Men ( and Women  ?)  could 
81 get to Blackpool in.
82     "  You can stop the smoking...it causes lung  cancer.   Well, 
83 pack you bags, bus comes in about half an hour.
84 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::
85     To those who may have just cried " foul " because of my  
86  entering a bus into " the medival Inn ", well don't worry.  The
87 road which it will travel on will only be there long enough to hop
88 on the bus.  Youa may be amused by my description of the bus, or
89 
90 maybe you won't, either way it arrives next entry.
91    About the debating remark...when we are presented with a 
92 emotional outcry such as Frank's, it makes it quite hard to give
93 a rational and logical response.   When I began logging on this system,
94 adventure writing was the rage.  I have never seen any of the classic
95 prose by some of the BW's literary giants, therfore I have no way of
96 conforming to their work.  If in fact these great debators re-appear
97 at the Inn, I will be glad to argue, and drop my trite fantasy and
98 spy stories.  Until then...

101 HI GUY'S JUST WHAT IS THIS GAME YOU'RE PLAYING?

107 
108        THE NETWORK HAS PICKED UP ADDITIONAL TRANSMISSIONS THAT HAVE
109        CONFIRMED THERE DOES INDEED EXIST A SMALL BAND OF FANATICS
110        LEAD BY A MANIACAL PERSON WITH THE NAME MOHAMMAD WASSIR.
111 
112        THIS GROUP CENTERS ITS OPERATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OF ALBANIA. OTHER
113        SECURITY AGENCIES HAVE CONFIRMED THEIR EXISTANCE PRIOR TO THE
114        CURRENT OPERATION UNDERGOING AGAINST THE MCKANE GROUP. 
115 
116        IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS MOHAMMAD CHARACTER IS A VERY SMALL WORRY
117        INDEED, FOR HE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A LOUD TALKING DISREPUTABLE
118        TERRORIST OF LITTLE NOTE, BUT HE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO ASSOCIATE WITH
119        LEROY MCKANE, AND HAS AIDED MCKANE ON SEVERAL PAST ADVENTURES. HIS
120        EXACT ALIGNMENT IS UNKNOWN, EVEN TO HIM APPARENTLY, BUT HE IS TO
121        BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS NONETHELESS.
122 
123        THE NET HAS DISPATCHED NET 06 TO TAKE CARE OF THIS NEWEST THREAT
124        TO OUR OPERATION. IF YOU ARE WONDERING WHY WE ARE DEVOTING AN
125        ENTIRE NET AGENT TO SUCH A MINOR PROBLEM, PAY IT NO MIND. NET 06
126        IS A NEW JUNIOR LEVEL AGENT, BUT HE IS CAPABLE OF DISPATCHING
127        HIS FELLOW NOVICE WASSIR WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE.
128 
129        AS WE STAND NOW, THE NET IS ABOUT TO LAUNCH ITS LATEST OFFENSIVE
130        ON MCKANE. IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT ANYTHING WILL REMAIN OF THE
131        ORGANIZATION AT THE COMPLETION OF THE OFFENSIVE, SO ALERT ALL
132        YOUR MOLES AND ALL DOUBLE AGENTS OF THE IMPENDING OPERATION.

137 As our little 'group' descended into the Dragon Room, I thought about
138 the rationale joshua and I had worked over in case the impossible happened,
139 and we were captured. We had discussed the use of our NET issue weapons, but
140 decided that in close quarters there was too much danger in a cross-fire.
141 Our tiny platic grenades, another NET central issue, were also not suited
142 to narrow stairwells and tiny torture chambers. With a signal to joshua not
143 unlike that found in "The Sting", we made it clear to each other we would
144 sit on our concealed weapons, and see what happened next. Our guards had
145 managed to overlook certain sections of our garmets when they made their
146 body checks, and a few of our NET issue items remained where Ian had
147 told us to place them, no matter how uncomfortable it was when we sat down!
148 As the huge chinese motif double doors opened, and our hosts
149 escorted us into the abyss known as the Dragon Room, I began to realize that
150 NET training and all, we might just be in for a heap of trouble. In the room
151 were some torture devices that I shudder even to think about. Some were
152 so obscure that Ian probably hadn't even thought of them yet, and all the
153 NET agents knew what a perverse pleasure Ian took in devising new ways to
154 extract information from enemy agents.
155 Petrov and joshua certainly realized by now unless we did something
156 quick, we would be in for possibly the worst evening of our in contrast
157 short lives. Worse than the time I had to make time with the East German
158 female shot putter only to find out it was her sister who was the courier
159 for the Russian silo blueprints. Worse than the time I had to endure a
160 thousand mile camal ride to ensure the safe delivery of the Kuwaitie Crown
161 Jewels to the new Prince, only to find out I was a decoy intended to divert
162 attention away from the real route for the jewels. But enough of this
163 reminiscing, we were in real trouble here, and I had to think of something
164 quick.
165  Funny, all that comes to mind is "Ian MacHinery! Get us the #*!%
166 out of here!"

183 To any who care...Le Nerd is back up for about 18 hours a day. Aall old messages
184 are intact and it all works much the same.
185 except for one minor difference. It is the fastest board around. The only time 
186 you have to wait is in killing a message which takes all of .3 seconds.
187 only because it is manipulating more then two files at one time.
188 The rest is all instant. We are now running one of the 6 fastest Epsons around
189 due to the prototype .5meg semidisk we have thanks to Jim Bell.
190 As usual, 1200 baud works welll, I have no idea about 300.
191 Sence no one in the Inn wants to interact, I may just go back to sleep...
192 Alex:hope the leg is healing nicely, if not, hope you don't care. If you get
193 my meanings! We need to get a risk game between the 2 of us some daay for an all
194 out contest. It has to be daytime because Ii am cursed with having to ride Tri-

199 AHHH-, SUCH A RESTFUL SLEEP. I AWOKE REFRESHED, ANS ANXIOUS TO BEGIN A NEW DAY. 
200 MY TREK TO THE DISTANT MOUNTAINS, AND THE PLACE SHOWN ON THE MAP I WAS GIVEN 
201 THAT LONG AGO DAY. I LAY THERE THINKING ABOUT THE DREAM I HAD BEEN LIVING FOR SO
202 LONG, WHEN I FELT SOMETHING MOVE BESIDE ME. ALARMED AT FIRST, I SUDDENLY REMEMBE
203 RED- THE RACCOON! HE WAS STILL HERE!. I REACHED OUT TO PET HIM, AND HE YAWNED, 
204 AND THEN CRAWLED UP ON MY CHEST, AND LOOKED AT ME AS IF TO SAY " WELL, DON'T YOU
205 THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME TO GET GOING?". 
206    AS I CRAWLED OUT OF MY LITTLE TENT, I BEHELD THE FOREST, RESPLENDANT IN IT'S 
207 GREENS AND BROWNS. LITTLE POOLS OF LIGHT COLLECTED HERE AND THERE AS THE SUNS 
208 RAYS FILTERED DOWN THROUGH THE BRANCHES ABOVE ME. I REALIZED IT WAS LATER THAN I
209 HAD THOUGHT. NO TIME FOR TEA, NO TIME TO BUILD A CAMPFIRE-I MUST BE ON MY WAY. 
210   I PACKED UP MY LITTLE TENT AND BEDROLL IN MY RUCKSACK, AND PICKING UP MY WALKI
211 NG STICK, SET OFF FOR THE MOUNTAINS. LOOKING DOWN, I SAW THAT THE RACCOON WAS 
212 RIGHT BESIDE ME, AND I WELCOMED HIM AS A TRAVELLING COMPANION. CONTINUED.[*=*][*

214 ALL: RINGWORLD IS PUT OUT BY CHAOSIUM GAMES. EVERYTHING IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE
215 SAME AS SET FORTH IN NIVEN'S BOOKS. ONE INTERESTING THING IS THAT ALL RACES
216 HAVE OCCASIONAL DEFECTS, BUT PUPPETEERS WHO ARE EXPLORERS ARE BY DEFINITION
217 INSANE. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY MAY BE MANIC-DEPRESSIVE, AS NESSUS WAS, OR MAYBE
218 A PUPPETEER WHO IS A CURRENT ADDICT OR COMPULSIVE  GAMBLER. THERE IS EVEN ONE
219 DEFECT WHEREIN FOR NO APPARENT REASON ONLY ONE HEAD TALKS.
220 A POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE TO HAVING A PUPPETEER CHARACTER IS THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE
221 OF HANDLING TWO DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS IN TWO DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SIMULTANEOUSL
222 Y. 
223 
224 THE COMBAT SYSTEM CONSISTS OF ROLLING EQUAL TO OR BELOW YOUR SKILL PERCENTAGE
225 FOR THE WEAPON YOU ARE USING, AND THEN ROLLING FOR HIT LOCATION. WHAT COULD 
226 BE SIMPLER? AS I HAVE SAID, THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF WEAPONS, INCLUDING PNEUMO-
227 PISTOLS AND PNEUMO-RIFLE WHICH USE COMPRESSED ATMOSPHERE AS A BULLET OR PROJ-
228 ECTILE. PUPPETEER DISINTEGRATORS ARE VERY RARE AND RUN ABOUT 40,000 STARS.
229 TASPS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. TASPS ARE FUN BECAUSE THEY ARE LIKE WIREHEADING 
230 SOMEONE AT A DISTANCE, ALSO KNOWN AS "MAKING HIS/HER DAY".
231 
232 THE GAME ALSO INCLUDES DESCRIPTIONS OF RINGWORLD AND THE KNOWN SPACE WORLDS.
233 THE WHOLE OF THE GAME CONSIST OF 4 BOOKS BETWEEN 36-60 PAGES LONG DETAILING
234 TECHNOLOGY, CREATURES, EXPLORERS (CHARACTERS), AND GAMEMASTERING.
235 SOON TO BE OUT WILL BE A SUPPLEMENT, "THE RINGWORLD COMPANION WITH MORE
236 CREATURES AND TECHNOLOGY AND TWO FULL LENGTH ADVENTURES.
237 I'LL HAVE FURTHER INFORMATION LATER FOR YOU AS I FIND OUT.
238 IF SOMEONE IS EXTREMELY INTERESTED THEN POSSIBLY GET IN TOUCH ON MODEM HOOKUP
239 BETWEEN OUR COMPUTERS. PERHAPS MIG OR MIKE GALASSI CAN ACT AS A GO-BETWEEN 
240 FOR SENSITIVE INFORMATION (PHONE #'S).......

243      Standing in the doorway, I look around for a moment.  Then 
244 a rather discordent rasping sound came from a table near the 
245 rear of the Inn.  Looking there in annoyance, I see a piper 
246 busily working on his pipes.  Since he half-heartedly waved to 
247 me, I decided to accept his invitaion and start to move towrds 
248 his table.
249      Just then, I am nearly bowled over by a group of rowdy 
250 citizens entering the Inn, and a moment later by another group 
251 leaving.  Slightly dazed, I make my way towards the pipers 
252 table.  Stopping momentarily at the bar to ask the Inn keeper 
253 for a hot cider, I finaly manage to find my way to the piper's 
254 table.
255      Sitting down, I ask him; "Is it always this loud in here?  
256 I can hardly hear myself think with all this ruckus."

258 
259 [*=*]: A nice start, but who are you and where do you go? I 
260 hope you don't go the way of so many others and only leave an 
261 entry or two, then get discouraged or bored and give up. I 
262 haven't seen that sort of writting here since PAM disappeared.

265 *************************************************************************:
266 MORBY: YOU DON'T BECOME A BW LITERARY GIANT OVER NIGHT. MOST OF THOSE WHO 
267 ARE CONSIDERED GIANTS HAVE ENTERED LESS THEN SOME OF THE NEWER USERS. IT IS 
268 RATHER THE QUALITY OF THE WRITING THAT MAKES THEM GREAT. THIS IS SOMETHING 
269 THAT BULIDS UP OVER TIME. SOME KICK AROUND FOR SOMETIME BEFORE BLOSSOMING 
270 INTO AN ACCEPTED WRITTER BY OTHER BW USERS. THIS HAPPENED TO PAM, SHE WAS A 
271 LURKER FOR SOMETIME, THEN ENTERED INTO A DEBATE, THEN ONE DAY SHE BURST 
272 FORTH WITH AN EXCELENT ENTRY WHICH SUDDENLY THRUST HER INTO THE LIMELIGHT AS
273 ONE OF THE GREAT BW WRITTERS.  D ON THE OTHER HAND ALMOST FROM THE START WAS 
274 CONSIDERED TO BE GREAT. SHE HAD AN INITIAL HALF-HEARTED ATTEMPT AT ENTRY, 
275 THEN WAS SILENT FOR A LONG WHILE UNTIL SHE GOT ACCESS AGAIN. THEN FOR A 
276 LONG PERIOD SHE LEFT SOME EXCELENT ENTRYS. SHE HAS NOT DONE SO OF LATE DO TO
277 HAVING GREATER INTEREST IN OTHER AREAS. AS FAR AS THE HIGH-TECH BAN AT THE 
278 INN IS CONCERNED, I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO START YOUR 
279 ADVENTURE (OR FOR THAT MATTER END IT) AT THE INN. THE ONE THING I WON'T 
280 STAND FOR IS THE DEGRADATION OF THE INN FROM WHAT IT HAS SO CAREFULLY BEEN 
281 BUILT UP TO BE. THIS IS WHY I BECAME ANGERED AT THE ATTEMPTED DESTRUCTION 
282 BY THE HIGH TECH GROUPIES. I WILL CONTINUE TO COMPLAIN VERY LOUDLY AT THE 
283 DISRUPTION OF THE INN'S ATMOSPHERE (THAT BEING MEDIEVAL; I.E. NO HIGH TECH 
284 STUFF ALLOWED). EVEN A TEMPORARY INFRACTION LEADS TO GREATER INFRACTIONS.
285 P.S. YOU ONLY NEED TO WAIT ABOUT ONE SECOND AT THE END OF EACH LINE, NOT TEN
286 SECONDS AS LONG AS YOU REMEMBER TO TYPE BOTTOM BEFORE GOING TO THE ENTER 
287 MODE THIS WILL SPEED UP YOU UPLOAD A BIT.

290    The piper finished the latest adjustments to his drone reeds and
291 saw the newcomer making his way over to the table.  Sliding his drones
292 into the stocks on the bag, the piper adjusted the cords that held the 
293 drones nicely fanned out when they lay on his shoulder.  Satisfied, he
294 set down the pipes, and asked the newcomer to sit down.
295   "Welcome to the inn," the piper said.  "I don't recall seeing you
296 here before.  Do you prefer adventuring or arguing?  There is 
297 usually someone willing to accomidate you for either activity."
298 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
299 To all -- re the discussions produced by Frank*
300    I do not find it necessary to justify the laws making child molestation
301 illegal.  As a parent, I am willing to go to much greater personal risk
302 to protect my children than for nearly any other reason.  This is pure 
303 emotion -- no scientific research, no logical justification, no rational
304 basis for decision -- just the way I totally and without reservation 
305 respond.  Obviously Frank will accept no answer other than one that allows
306 him free sexual access to all children he feels an attraction for.
307    The purpose of law in society is to control the behaviour of those who
308 refuse to control their own behaviour.  If I can discover Frank's true
309 name and address, I will immediately inform whatever authorities I can
310 contact.  Hopefully this will restrain his activities.  I consider it a
311 much lesser evil to destroy his life (if, indeed, this action did destroy
312 his life) than to allow him to destroy a number of other lives.
313    If he approaches a child of mine, the first step will be the police.
314 I feel that I'll give the "social machinery" a chance to handle the 
315 problem.  If it works (i.e. prevents his contact with other children)
316 that's all that's necessary.  If it doesn't -- that's the time to look
317 at options like amateur surgery.
318    To Frank:
319 One point should be abundantly clear.  I will not tolerate your "lifestyle".
320 I am not making threats, I am making a true statement.  No rationalization
321 or other arguement will move me on that point.  You get an emotional
322 response because you push several instinctive buttons.  When you threaten
323 my young, you place yourself in jeapordy.  You don't like the threats, 
324 change your behaviour.  I'm glad you're seeing a counsellor.  I hope that
325 he is working on changing you rather than getting you to accept yourself
326 as you are.  If the latter, you're wasting your money.  Until you change,
327 you *are* unacceptable.

342           unrelated to the current one, similar in length but not necessarily.
343           To encode a text containing information of a non-sensitive nature,

368   I am well aware that only about a second is necessary to wait before each
369 line.  It just so happens that the delay implemented by the modem software
370 I am using is much too long, and I have no way of changing it.  Without this
371 delay, I lose charcaters, as you well know.
372    Secondly, I will make no claims to be one of BW's great writers.  My
373 style, and the content of my stories do not agree with most others on
374 this system.  I was just wondering why you chose this time to complain
375 of the lack of debating talent in the present load of users, because of
376 the lack of quality response.  It is my opinion that almost all the entries
377 were quite good, yet it is very hard to argue with someone who is sure
378 that he is right, and sure the we are wrong.  His entries only allowed
379 him to hear himself talk, and nothing else.
380    You of all people should realize that if you want to change the nature
381 of the writing on your own system, then you should do it, because no one
382 is going to listen.  Yet, many people such as myself prefer to try their
383 hand at Fantasy literature in a environment where they won't be laughed at.
384   If you wish to give me a standard to attempt to reach, why not dig into
385 the BW archieves, and dig out on of Pam or d's classic entries.  If our
386 or at least my work is so deplorable, the space which this old entry would
387 fill would be well used.
388   MiG - I assumed that you were with us already.  I will have the next
389 entry in soon...

392 INNISFALL (AP)   According to Innisfall Police, a dazed man was discovered
393 wandering nude through the Thieve's Quarter of the city.  Police Lt. Harry
394 Chest stated that the man would only identify himself as NET operative 06.
395 "It was horrible;" said Lt. Chest.  "It appears the poor man was attacked
396 by a person or persons unknown wielding the dreaded Albanian toilet
397 plunger."  Hospital officials report that the subject is in serious 
398 condition, suffering from 3rd degree hickies over 80% of his body.  They
399 added that the man will be transferred to the Innisfall Insane Asylum 
400 when he recovers from his injuries.  Authorities state the inveswtstigation
401 is continuing, but no suspects are known at this time.

403 PORTLAND (AP)   Talent agent Lance Q. Pinkstaff announced today that the
404 famed KGB drag queen, Petrov, will come out of retirement shortly to

406 Russian female impersonater's lamb, Fluffy, will accompany him on the

410 MORBY: STOP COMPLAINING
411 :*************************************************************:
412 Joshua:
413 
414 I would like to apologize for offending you in my message to 
415 Wassir. I had no intention of putting you down or hurting your 
416 feelings. I'm sorry.
417 
418 I never intended to criticize you or your writing. From what 
419 I've read of your work you appear to be quite good. I was 
420 merely saying that I find an exclusive use of narrative 
421 limiting.
422 
423 Narration is great for describing scenes, characters, or 
424 action...but it's slow in moving the plot along. I find sudden 
425 plot twists are what make adventures fun. If you've followed 
426 the McKane adventure you've seen that major plot developments 
427 usually happen through memos, news bulletins, announcements, 
428 but seldom through narration.
429 
430 So you see, I'm not criticizing your writing at all. It's 
431 merely that I have a preference for a faster paced style.
432 
433 I started the McKane adventure probably about a year ago and 
434 have been the primary force keeping it going. I've put a great 
435 deal of time, thought, and imagination into it, and quite 
436 frankly, I need a break.
437 
438 As to the current adventure, I'm watching with interest as 
439 it develops. My intention, for the moment at least, is to sit 
440 on the sidelines and take a well earned rest.
441 
442 Good luck in destroying the McKane organization. You'll 
443 it. LeRoy McKane is one slippery son of a bitch.
444 
445 Once again, my apologies, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
446

450 NEWCOMERS TO THE INN - Some of you appear intimidated by the legend of the 
451 "greatness" of the writing of PAM and d. The legend is purely myth. 
452 Neither of these women is any better at writing than most of you. The 
453 only thing that makes there contributions stick out is that they are 
454 virtually the only women here.
455      Someone suggested that an example of the best of PAM and d be 
456 re-entered on Backwater. I strongly suggest that this be done. It would lay 
457 to rest forever the myth of there greatness.

460   Grand D. - Believe me, you would know when I was complaining.  I was 
461 just making a comment to Mikey, wondering about his sudden change in
462 mood and temperment.
463   I requested the re-publication of Pam's or d's work, just so I and the
464 others who are reasonably new could see their work.  If there writing
465 allows their myth to hold water, so be it.  Otherwise, I wish that we
466 could stop dwelling on the input of the departed members, and maybe
467 honor the great writers that are presently here such as Piper and Joshua.
468 These and many more don't need to be constantly reminded that they are
469 not as good the people who frequented the Inn some time ago.
470   Personally, I do not wish to be associated with this group, because
471 that means I would have to be a role model, and not be controversial,
472 such as I am being now.   I am waiting for replies...

490           love to meet whoever entered the message with the"|+|+|"

493           know who entered that in, if I am right he will be given
494           fare trial then I'll kick him into next week. Now that I

501 
502      All, I think reading a entry from Pam or D would be great! they
503           get alot of public praise but I have never seen anything
504           from either of them. It would be nice to see what every one

509 LASETER STOOD UP, STRETCHED HIS LIMBS TO WASH AWAY THE FATIGUE AND LOOKED
510 AROUND HIS NEWEST PRISON. THE PIRATES HAD BEEN AFTER THE GALRANIAN GEMS
511 AND HAD CLEANED OUT THE VAULT AND CARGO BAYS TOOT SWEET. THEY HAD THEN 
512 SPACED THE REST OF THE CREW LEAVING JUST LASETER (WHO HAD HIDDEN IN THE
513 SLUDGE TANKS OF THE 'PONICS BAY) TO FEND FOR HIMSELF IN A PILOTLESS SHIP.
514 "JUST WHAT I GET FOR LISTENING TO THAT SON OF A SLIME EATER, FIN! HE
515 MUTTERED TO HIMSELF, "AND NOW, HERE I AM, SOME FEW HUNDRED PARSECS FROM
516 THE NEAREST INHABITED SYSTEM!" THE HOLLOW SOUND OF HEELS ON STEEL DECKS
517 ECHOED BEFORE AND AFTER HIM.  STARING AT THE DECK AS HE WALKED A GOLDEN
518 GLIMMER CAUGHT HIS EYE.  UPON REACHING THE SPOT WHERE IT LAY HE FOUND IT
519 TO BE A KEY. IT WAS SIMILAR TO THE KEYS THAT FIN SOLD AND OR RENTED FOR
520 THAT OUT OF THE WAY COMPANY (WHAT WAS THEIR NAME? OH WELL!) FOR AN EXTRA
521 CREDIT NOW AND THEN. TURNING IT IN HIS HAND HE REMEMBERED THE WORDS TO
522 SAY AND THAT HE MUST FOCUS ON THE PLACE HE WISHED TO BE. GATHERING UP HIS
523 COURAGE, AND A FEW GEMS THE PIRATES HAD MISSED, HE BEGAN THINKING ABOUT
524 HOME AND RECITED THE ACTIVATING WORDS AS HE HELD THE KEY ALOFT:
525  "OVER HILL, OVER DALE I WANT TO HIT THE DUSTY TRAIL THAT SENDS ME, OH
526 SO QUICKLY TO HOME." AT FIRST, NOTHING HAPPENED, ANOTHER ONE OF FINS'
527 BLOODY JOKES! HE THOUGHT. THEN THE KEY BEGAN TO VIBRATE AND HUM. SOON

539 As for Frank, I had a friend once who had been convicted for that sort 
540 of thing. I only found this out after I had known him for about a year. He had 
541 had a problem. He was (hopefully) over it. Some mutual friends who knew of his
542 past even let him babysit. (I *DO* recall a comment about "arm-breaking" as a
543 deterrent to temptation, though.)

546 Rocky's Bar and Grill in Chinatown. "It could have been some of Rocky's old Mob 
547 connections" stated an officer. 
548 Witnesses claim that "some sort of BIG tank" demolished the alley door.
549 One claims that he saw "a man dressed in some kinda funny clothes, black like in
550 them Chuck Norris movies" carry three men out of the building and into the tank.
551 The authorities have no comment on this. 
552 There are rumors that a secret room was found in the basement of the

571      Well, I must say that I find my sudden elevation to Godhood somewhat
572 strange.  As Mikey can tell you, I never have felt I could write well at
573 all, so seeing myself labeled as one of BW's "Greats" leaves me feeling
574 rather shocked.  While I find that I have very little time to make contri-
575 butions, I still enjoy reading the entries of others, and I find that they
576 are all both fun and imaginative.
577 
578      Yes, it is me (I?).  The reason for the change in border is out of
579 respect for Lord Morby, who is using the border I used the majority of the
580 time.  Morby is more than welcome to it, since I have no copyright on it,
581 nor am I currently using it with any regularity.
582 
583      Mikey, you will see more of me in the future, but I tend to hesitate to
584 make any entries that I can't give the proper time and effort to, and I
585 simply don't have the time these days.  Ah, the life of the working woman!

605 AND RUMMAGED ABOUT IN MY RUCKSACK, AND TOOK OUT THE SMALL LEATHERBOUND BOOK 
606 THAT CONTAINED MY JOURNALS, A SMALL ALMANAC, AND THE AGED PARCHMENT MAP. UNF

608 THE NORTH ARROW TO THE SUN, NOW ALMOST AT IT'S ZENITH, AT THE SUMMER SOLSTIC
