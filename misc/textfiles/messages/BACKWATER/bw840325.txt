42 #Bard: the answer to the first is
43    you must seek out the originater of primal belch theripy.
44 It was a two position alphabetic shift.
45 The second seems to be Graymalkin  (interesting!).
46 I know, I know - you would have gotten that too.  Well, until
47 I get up enough courage to actively join an 'adventure', I must
48 content myself with occasional commentary.
49 Thanks for the BOLO info.  Is that a Retief story? I've not read
50 them all, I have to be in a particularly 'silly' mood for them.

55 Voyeur:in communicating with the Bard over a strange and wonderful medium
56 known as the "telephone" he stated that he would have wanted to solve said 
57 riddle himself.oh well,you` are correct in the name of the cat also.you
58 seem to have an enormus store of knowledge,so for you...
59 how long does process c-41 take and at what temp??

65 To all:  It looks like our wizard is on the ball!  (I'm glad that someone 
66 can answer the questions -- I'm typing this at 5:00 AM and things get kind
67 of fuzzy around the edges.)
68 Bard:  I have commited this Saturday to my young one.  It gets difficult
69 
70 to break a date with a 4-year old.  They do not accept excuses.  When is
71 the next meeting?  (This time I'll mark it on the calendar and reserve 
72 that time!)
73 Deborah:  I haven't seen you trying to stir up an arguement for a while!
74 Let's get a topic going -- how about mixing morality into our adventure?
75 We should probably get out of Oz and break new ground somewhere.  Perhaps
76 in a Fundamentalist Christian Universe where prayer is compulsory in public
77 schools and teachers who are not devout enough are stoned in the schoolyard
78 by the administration?  (When I taught school I made it a matter of 
79 principle never to get stoned on school property!)
80 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
81    The piper asked his compainions as they stood in the wizard's room,
82 "Do you have enough information to go on?  I am unable to complete the 
83 mental exercises and must depent upon your knowlege and guidance in these
84 wizardly matters.  I can help, but someone must furnish direction!"
85 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
86 Ah, the sight of all these words of  wisdom and great humor have fired
87 the great inferno of thought. I'd rather not visit this neat place
88 where you get stoned just for not conforming. When 'I' was in school
89 you got stoned to be a non-conformist, my how times do change!
90 As for all this talk of fees for usage, please, oh great Sysop in the
91 sky, keep it just as it is! A poor and starving person { such as myself}
92 could not possibly say enougxh about the advantages of free time. While
93 I'm new at this, it rhelps to see others in their natural environs and
94 learn.  Without the use of FREE systems there is no chance to learn!
95     I thank you all!  FINI FIN

97 M. d'Autun: Surely you are familiar with TPC? As anyone who has ever seen
98 James Coburn in "The President's Analyst" could tell you, TPC is a most dread 
99 organization! (T.P.C. = The Phone Company)
100 ********************************************************************************
101 Mr. Peckinpah, I must correct thee. Tandy cannot possibly have anything to do
102 with reality pills! They are a non-patentable item! And in any case, no one on
103 Earth knows how they are made. They were brought here by an alien race. 
104 (it is a VERY long story)
105 ..............................the apprentice....................................
106 Voyeur: please refrain from answering my questions before I get to them!
107 As for the BOLO stories, they are NOT silly. They have nothing to do
108 with Retief (well, they are mentioned in passing a couple of times, but that's
109 it). If the only Laumer you have read are the Retief stories, you have a 
110 somewhat skewed idea of his writing. He is quite capable of writing serious
111 stories.
112 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
113 Piper: the meetings are every OTHER Saturday, thus the next meeting is April 7th
114 (if nothing happens!)

116 "Mckane AGAIN!" shouted bard, (the following is translated from
117 a WIDE variety of languages) "May maledictions follow this nameless one to the 
118 uttermost depths of world slime, may he have a long life in interesting times, 
119 ......." after a bit he paused, "Sorry, but he is beginning to get on my nerves!
120 Everywhere we turn -- there he is! That, that... OH! HIS PARENTS WERE BROTHERS!"

154 the following is a partial transcript of a conversation between M. d'Autun and
155 his secretary:
156 M:Any messages while I was out?
157 S:Yes, sir. The Department of Motor Vehicles says that the license # of
158 the company limo hasn't been issued yet. The police wanted the correct license 
159 number for the stolen vehicle report.
160 Sir, when I called back, they couldn't find the case number....
161 M: (muttering, possibly "it figures")
162 S:Anyway, you got a call from immigration, something about a visa problem...
163 M: (wearily)Anything else?
164 S:Yes, sir. I can't get the Telex to work, so I haven't been able to send
165 those messages.
166 
167 ...............
168 As you can see, we are preceding according to plan. The only way
169 d'Autun will be able to get a msg thru is by going in person. (of course, he may
170 have some trouble with his reservations...) All bank accounts have been diverted
171 but there are large cash reserves in various locations.

176      After bushwacking through the forest for several hours, we finally
177 reached the city's wall.  The wall was your standard Ozish blue -- smooth
178 with no outcroppings or cracks visible, approxiamtely 18' high.  A sign
179 hung on it:
180                "TRESPASSERS WILL BE TURNED INTO FROGS"
181      I turned to Wassir; "O.K. wise guy, this was your bright idea.  What
182 do we do now?"  With an impish grin he pulled a length of rope and grappling
183 hook from beneath his tunic.  He proceeded to toss it to the top of the wall
184 where it held fast.  We rapidly climbed up and over to the other side.
185      Once inside the city we were confronted by an alley running eastbound.
186 No inhabitants were visible.  Stealthily we moved down the alley to what
187 appeared to be a main thoroughfare.  Peeking around the corner we spied
188 beings of all shapes and sizes.  Munchins and elves and even little people
189 made of china.  All had one thing in common--they were wearing blue-tinted
190 glasses.
191      I whispered to Wassir; "We can't go out these.  Without those funny
192 looking shades, we'll be recognized in a second."
193      Wassir moved to a storm drain at the edge of the alley and pried up
194 the grating. "I know.  The only way to go is down."
195      "We can't go down there.  There's probably all kinds of rats, snakes,
196 and spiders lurking for us." <Shudder>
197      "Can it Salazar.  Any dufus knows the best way to reach the wizard's
198 lair is through the underground tunnels."  I looked down into the darkened
199 hole and felt my anxiety rising.
200      We climbed down into the tunnel and closed the grate behind us.  The
201 tunnel was lit by smoking torches held in sconces every 100'.  After fifteen
202 minutes we were hopelessly lost.  I knew we were in big trouble.
203      After a couple of hours of roaming, we stopped to rest.  Wassir played
204 a mournful tune on his recorder; whilst I daydreamed about Serena.  Suddenly
205 the tramping of many boot-shod feet and the clanking of weapons broke our
206 reveries.  At the far end of the passageway several foul-looking Orcs 
207 appeared. 
208      Wassir tried the friendly approach: "Hi guys, could you tell us where
209 the nearest bathroom is?"  Friendly isn't in the Orc vocabulary.  With 
210 blood-curdling warcries they charged, weapons drawn.  Instantly my magna-
211 ported .44 was in my fist, spitting lead at the subhuman monsters that
212 attacked us.  Wassir's trench knife took care of those that got too close.
213 When my gun was empty, I grabbed a fallen sword and joined in hand to hand
214 combat... Blood lust in my heart.
215      More Orcs began to pour into the passageway.  I shouted "RUN!!!" Wassir
216 and I sprinted through the twisting tunnels.  Our pursuers close at our 
217 heels.  Just as we started to outdistance them, we were cut off by a deadend
218 We turned to fight our final battle.  This was it.
219      As the Orcs edges closer, a voice rang in out brains:  #Big ones in
220 deep do-do, we will help#  Suddenly, the floor dropped from our feet.  We
221 fell a short distance and then started rolling down a steep incline.  We
222 ended up in a heap in a strange room.  Arcane instruments and musty leather-
223 bound books lined the walls.  At the far end of the room several 
224 outlandishly dressed people stood staring at us in disbelief.  One was
225 different from the rest.  He had an aura of mystical and ageless power.  I
226 glanced at Wassir.  He dreww himself to his feet... a childish glint in his
227 eye.  He piped up:
228                      "Hello Mr. Wizard..."

231 My dearest Leroy;
232      I also have noticed an unusual activity on the international and 
233 domestic espionage scene.  Of course all that has passed between us has just
234 been a slight misunderstanding.  My resources will be at your disposal to
235 combat the mysterious interloper.  If indeed it is The Phone Company, we
236 may be in deep do-do.  As I am currently in an alternate reality, Serena
237 will be contacting you shortly regarding our alliance.

263 Dearest Leroy;
264      Mohammed asked me to contact you about the mysterious new power on the
265 spy scene.  I have little information other than they seem to have control
266 of AP wire services and most data communications networks.  Various state,
267 federal and international enforcement agencies seem to be in the dark.
268 You can reach me at Salazar's office in Old Town.  Be discrete.  Salazar
269 would be very angry if he knew I was working for Wassir again.  If you have
270 time drop by.  Bring a donkey; I'll supply the trapeze set.
271                                      Anxiously,

276 Apprentice: My apologies, but with Tandy's formidable marketing power, the
277 aliens you spoke of chose us as the sole distributer of the reality pills.
278 We were still in FDA testing phase when we became aware of the unauthorized
279 use of the still-not-completely-tested pills. Our concern is due to the fact
280 that advance use by non-testing agents of the pill have hurt our chances
281 of getting it approved for general sale. It has also hust our standing with
282 the FDA, who up until this point we have had a good relationship with.
283  
284 Our references with the aliens are quite secure, and our records are 
285 available for public inspection under the Freedom of Information Act. Any
286 sensitive material has been removed from the public record of course.
287 Thank you for your memo.

323 Re:    Human Invasion, Sector 14B
324 
325 All hail:
326 
327 At 1415 a large invasion party of heavily armed humans attacked our recon
328 party in Sector 14B.  Descriptions of leaders are as follows:
329      #1.  Big floppy ears, idiotic grin, bears a strong resemblence to
330           Alfred E. Neuman
331      #2.  Tall man in khaki; brown hair, BIG gun
332 Subjects lead a party of at least 50-100 of those vile, smelly humans that
333 attacked our peaceful recon party without warning or provocation. 
334 Casualties to our forces were a mere 17 Orcs.  Reinforcements arrived in the
335 nick of time to repulse the invaders.  Casualties inflicted by our heroic
336 forces to the humans were heavy.  No body count available.
337 
338 Request further reinforcements to launch an all out attack against humans.
339 We will take no prisoners.
340                                          Respectfully,

405    The piper watched the action with  disbelief.  Vast tides of power shifted
406 and pulled at the present reality.  Another blending took place, it seemed that
407 middle earth was grafted into the sewers of Oz.  (It also seems that the 
408 person doing the grafting was color-blind!  While the graft was being done,
409 the distinction between blue and green disappeared.)  As the color non-red 
410 faded into blues and greens, the piper sensed that a powerful conflict was in
411 the making.  Thinking to warn the peacful inhabitants of the city, he stepped
412 out the door and nearly into the jaws of an immense tiger with a pink ribbon
413 tied in a bow on its tail.  Stopping short, the piper decided to be VERY polite
414 indeed.  The tiger yawned and stretched -- those teeth must be five inches
415 long! -- then asked in a rather bored voice, "Where are you going little man?"
416 and continued, "You wouldn't happen to have any fat babies with your party
417 would you?  I'm getting hungry again and havent eaten a fat baby for a long,
418 long time."  The piper breathed a sigh of relief.  
419   "You must be the Hungry Tiger.  Quick!  We must let everyone know that 
420 trouble is brewing.  Someone has grafted the reality of middle-earth onto the
421 sewers of Oz.  Not only does there seem to be a party of Orcs approaching, I'm
422 sure we'll see trolls, wolves, and other creatures trying to get in.
423    The tiger yawned again and said "Don't worry, little man.  We have coped
424 with worse situations in the last 80 years.  This is the kind of place that
425 someone is always tring to but in on.  Now you just get back to your own 
426 adventure and we'll keep it off our streets.  
427   The piper somehow found himself turned around and propelled gentluy through 
428 the door by a velvet paw against his back.  As the door shut, he heard a VERY
429 deep voice saying, "I know, but it's not FAIR to let a wicked witch in who 
430 only saw the movie.  She would not know enough to be worth worryi.." THUNK
431 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
432 IS THERE ANYBODY IN THERE?
433 JUST NOD IF YOU CAN HEAR ME...

436 YOU GUY'S ARE ALL NUTS!                                                     SIGNED:                                THE MANAGEME
437 ................................................................................
438 Mr. Peckinpah: I suggest you check out the aliens more carefully! Those blue 
439 lobsters were trying to conquer your world by using the "side-effects" of the
440 pills!
441 I *can* supply documentation, if neccesary!
442 ................................
443 The apprentice pulled a crystal ball (actually, more of a marble)
444 from his pouch. He looked into it and spoke, "I'd like to place a mage to witch 
445 call to Glinda the Good..."
446 "Greetings, Your Wisdom, I am honored that you have accepted this
447 contact", without moving a muscle the apprentice gave the impression of having 
448 made a deep and courtly bow. "While I realize that your people can handle the
449 orcs quite well, I feel that we owe you some aid. They are almost certainly
450 here because of us."
451 "I know of some people who can remove these creatures with a minimum of
452 disturbance. In any case, I must notify my liege of this intrusion, no matter 
453 what your decision."
454 "I will await your decision. Ciao."
455 He made a gesture and the sense of another's presence faded. He replaced
456 the ball and took out a ring which he placed on his third finger. 
457 #Pentagram HQ. Please state your business#
458 #I am Eric of the House of Camber. I must speak to Lord Sam the Grey.
459 I have news of an orcish invasion.#
460 #Immediately, sir!#
461 #What is this about an invasion, lad? This had better be important!#
462 #Look into my mind, milord...............#
463 #I see, we'll be there SOON!#
464 #But, lord, what of..#
465 #I *SAID* we ARE COMING! I know little of this "Oz" place, but if 
466 there are orcs, then we are going to get them - do you understand APPRENTICE?#
467 #yes, your lordship#
468 
469 "I was afraid of that.... Wizard, your pardon, but my liege is determined
470 to come. It was my duty to inform him, but I fear the consequences". The 
471 apprentice seem very small as he stood waiting.
472 While everyone was trying to decide how to handle this new devolopment,
473 a figure seemed to materialize out of the air in front of Wassir and Salazar. 
474 They reached for their weapons, only to discover that the figure had them in his
475 hands! "You two looked like the most trigger happy, so I relieved you of these
476 toys. You couldn't of done any real damage, but I didn't want to waste half an
477 hour healing up."
478 "Allow me to introduce my self, the name is Sam. Some of my Pentagram 
479 colleagues are returning the orcs n' tunnels to OUR world. We can take care of
480 them there." Turning to the apprentice, he said, "Now look, I thought I told you
481 to try and stay out of trouble! You're almost as bad as your father. Try not to 
482 end up like he did, OK?"
483 Tossing the weapons back to their owners, he started to fade out again, "Mouse 
484 is gonna love this, fresh orcs....."
485 ............................................the apprentice......................
486 ps to Mr Peckinpah: the pills are not patentable, because they were desribed in 
487 open literature more than 10 years before the application was filed! Check with
488 your legal section!

504 What! Someone implies that I don't have the real gem! Let's see here.
505 Reaching into my trans-reality box I whip out the gem I have.
506 Glowing a drak green, the gem speaks,"I await you command, oh fool!"
507 "Then...you are the real gem?"
508 "All but a sliver."
509 "But....what are your powers?"
510 "My powers are beyond your imagination, oh mortal!"
511 "Then shrink lacells ship into the palm of my hand."
512 Holding my hand palm up, I notice a miniture ship has materialized.
513 Just what I need! Opening up my trans-reality box, I chuck it into one of 
514 the realities that the box services. This gem scares me. Plop! I chuck the
515 gem into still another reality and lock the box to my mental waves. 
516 "Well then, off to see the wizard," I whisper to myself as I hop
517 into the tunnels under the city.   -The Ninja-

529 Memo to all Reality Pill Corp div of Tandy Corp distributers...
530 
531 Regrettably I must inform you all the Reality Corp will cease to exist
532 as a corporate entity as of the 1, April, 1984. Our legal section, under the
533 guidance of one known as 'the apprentice' has discovered the aliens who were
534 to be our sole suppliers of the reality pill, for which your corporation was
535 formed to distribute, were merely a small outlaw faction with no real power
536 in the courts or government of the alien's ruling class.
537 
538 This turn of events is rather difficult to swallow, but, as employees
539 of Tandy corp, you will not be left out in the cold by the blunders of our
540 marketing dept. Applications are being sent for re-assignment, please have
541 them filled out and turned in by 9:00 AM, March 30th, Two Tandy Towers
542 Fort Worth Texas, USE, Earth.
543 
544 Please put your minds at rest, and be re-assured that those in
545 marketing who are responsible for the fiasco will suffer the same fate as
546 those who had Tandy invest so heavily in CB radios, they will be forced to
547 become floor managers at local Toys-R-Us outlets.
548 
549 Thank you and again please accept my apologies...

555 
556 Aside to 'the apprentice' : The board of directors, and myself, CEO of
557 Reality corp, wish to give you our sincere thanks for pointing out the
558 aliens scam. Although we did lose some money on the deal, it is a pittance
559 compared to what would have been lost if trans-glaxian shipping routes etc,
560 would have been set up...
