5 GENERAL DISCLAIMER: BWMS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INFORMATION
6                     PLACED ON THIS SYSTEM.
7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privately owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system. As the system is
10 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
11 I may find offensive. Because of the limited size of the system, it will be
12 periodically purged of messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
13 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out of the
14 ENTER mode. The message is automatically stored. If after entering the
15 message you find you made a mistake, use the replace command to replace
16 the line. To exit from the system, type 'OFF' then hang up.
17 Type 'HELP' to see other commands that are available on the system.

21 Enough is enough! You don't like the way I run this system? Fine! Go
22 find another one, because as of the 31st I am pulling the plug.
23 I am tired of wasting $30 a month and as many hours of my time just to
24 put up with this. There are many users who know and understand the rules
25 of the Inn, and they have helped to maintain them. To them I say thank you.
26 But I am feed up with continually having to clean and repair things,
27 and to be lambasted about it is just too much. This is a message system,
28 not a bathroom wall to scrible lewd remarks on.
29 I hope you're happy.

32 I'm sorry I'm one of the newer users of this board.  Maybe I didn't
33 read the intoduction all the way through.  I'm sorry.  I should have
34 done something different but I'm not sure what I could have done.  I
35 heard that the Inn had been around for a long time, gone through something
36 called a 'juvie hunt' or something really bad.  Can't it live through
37 something like this?  I hope so.  Well, I have been thinking about a story
38 but I'm not sure if it is good enough to enter in.  I am not a writter,
39 I just like talk to people.  I better get running.  Oh, am I at the Top?
40 Feels like the bottom.

44   Ah, are you serious about closing BackWater down before New Years? I am,
45 ah, er, truly sorry for what I seem to have done, please accept my apology?
46   I do not know who Limercist was, but I sorrowfully admit to being Odds &
47 Ends. I am sorry, and I apologize with the most sincerity I have felt in...
48 I am not sure how long.
49   Please don't forsake BackWater, whatever has been said in criticism of
50 BackWater was only in hopes of making the system perfection.
51   None of it was meant as shaming you or your system, I'm sure. And for my
52 small part, I must say that I have never maligned the system in Word or in
53 Deed. Please, I'm sorry...

57 Ahem, uh, uh ( Picture this realy dumb look on my face.) Imagin my suprise 
58 when Mr. Hawthorne told me to go read BackWater. And what I found.
59 A world of non-creative BBS systems awaits the user of BW when this system
60 falls. I know that I have stopped using most of the other boards around, 
61 they are pale by comparison. BackWater  is a board that has genuine deep
62 human interaction. One of the very few around. This system caused me to 
63 meet my current employer, and a good deal of my friends. Mikey has made 
64 his decision, and I respect that. I just can't help thinking of the loss of
65 this forum, something that has helped me grow and mature.   Snif.

68    Double snif.  I haven't been around for a long while and reading
69 the beginning of this disk was a large blow.  It's true, all the 
70 other boards are very dull next to this one.  I didn't believe it
71 until I read it.  What will all the original people of the do, where
72 will they go?  Well, I better get running along.  Se ya, Maybe I 
73 could call back before the 31st.  Bye.

76 All I can say, this all to bleary night, is that words fail me. Nary a sentence or word comes to mind that would exhibit the

79 MIKE: YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU FEEL YOU MUST, BUT BELIEVE ME, FOR
80 EVERY CRETIN OUT THERE WHO HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT SOME INSIGNIF-
81 ICANT PROBLEM, THERE ARE TEN WHO ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF YOU AND
82 YOUR EFFORTS TO RUN THIS FINE SYSTEM. I AM ASHAMED FOR THE
83 COMPUTER WORLD IN GENERAL TO HAVE SUCH LOW-LIFES AS TO MAKE FUN
84 OF YOUR SYSTEM AND YOUR OPERATITON OF THE SYSTEM. WHAT EVER
85 HAPPENS, YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE SUPPORTERS, AND 	HOPEFULLY WHAT
86 YOU CONSIDER FRIENDS. THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN GREAT, AND
87 IF THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE OUR MEMORIES OF
88 GOOD TIMES ON BACKWATER. FOR NOW, JUST CALL ME

92         or to put it more coherently... 
93 I feel like a doctor just told me that I've got four weeks to live...
94  
95    (uhhhh, Mikey? I don't want to seem like a vulture or anything, but if you
96 ARE serious about shutting down the system, would you consider {gasp, shudder}
97 SELLING it?) (yes, I know, my presumption is exceeded only by my stupidity..)
98

100   Well, it's been fun folks..

108 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
109 I keep the computer on re-dial, not suspecting the terrible news that waits to spring itself upon me.  Then, it 
110 beeps, informing me that I am on.  I go to drive b, read what is there, and then switch drives.  A load of bricks falls
111 upon me from the top of drive a.
112 I do not have to repeat that Backwater is an unusual system, the best I have ever seen.  I do not have to say that I
113 respect everyone here and hope that they call me 'friend'.  I don't have to say that I enjoy everything that is entered
114 here, no matter what the source.  I do have to say that I will miss BW, and that I will miss the gems of literature 
115 found here.  The 31st... it seems so near now.  Where will I go?
116 Farewell, my friends,
117              A sad Milchar.
118 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
119      NO! NO! Say it ain't so!!!!!!  For all of us who have just discovered the
120 Inn, and who have been stimulated and intrigued by the writing here, I beg you
121 to reconsider, Cistop Mikey.  Can there not be some lesser step than "pulling
122 the plug"?  While part of the charm of BWMS was its accessibility to one and all
123 maybe the validation approach used by many other systems could be added...or 
124 even (ughhh)the system used by the late Rome BBS--two users must vouch for a new
125 user before he/she can be allowed to use the board.  Please, please, please,
126 please reconsider...but if you still find the BWMS too demanding, well, perhaps
127 it was too good to live.  Deep appreciation for a job well done,

156 Tammy:  I haven't been at The INN much longer than you have, but what you've 
157 said at the bottom of your 'letter' is what we all hear from almost all of the 
158 newcomers. The truth is that I leave alot more messages than chapters of the
159 story I have.  I'm not a writer either, and I'll wager that alot of the others
160 weren't either until they stumbled across a telephone number to something
161 called 'The BackWater...' Understandably, this place fills one with excitement
162 and turns them towards the direction of creative writing- IT DID IT TO ME!
163 So for those who haven't told you yet, I'll tell you: DO IT! POST YOUR STORY
164 AT THE INN! YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BUT YOUR INHIBITIONS!
165 Speaking of inhibitions, maybe we should give one to Mr. Day...
166 O.K., you're up next...
167 *CISTOP*:    STOP!   Don't do it!   Call suicide prevention... ANYTHING but
168  pulling the plug! I'm not too outward, but half the (future) friends I have
169  are at The INN. This place isn't different, it's ORIGINAL and we all love
170  you for what you've given us. This is the ONLY place with ANY atmosphere at
171  all. I've only been to The INN for about three weeks, and yet I see new
172  pen-names tagged on to letters of praise almost every other day; praise-
173  doesn't that tell you something? You've got a good... (scratch that) GREAT
174  thing going here. Isn't there an alternative to locking the door to the 
175  Think Tank? Yes, and it is this: TRY to let the insults of the uneducated
176  malcontents flow right on by, and concentrate only on the items with any
177  real input or insight. 
178   I could go on for eons, but I won't. (thank god) Only two words stand clear.
179                          Don't...     Please!

226 Oh no!  I have to leave town for a least two weeks tomorrow, and now I find that
227 the Inn may not be here when I return! D--n it!  Perhaps user donations would 
228 take some of the agravation out of running this system?  I know I would 
229 contribute, and I generally just read, not write.  Is there anyone out there who
230 is saving BW files in Atari (gasp!--yes,Atari) format?  Would like to see you
231 when I return.  Will be on again tomorrow, before the plane leaves.
232 
233                                                               Brian Duffy

237    It was a chill autumn wind that lashed round the inn, bending the bare
238 branches of the rowan tree at the front door, driving sheets of rain nearly
239 horizontal across the path.  The piper was bent against the driving rain,
240 soaked through, his kilt flapping wetly against his legs, his plaid giveing
241 very little protection from the wet.  Numbly shouldering past the lashing 
242 branches of the rowan tree, he paused at the scarred oaken door.  Holding the 
243 latch tightly, he pressed the door open and entered in a gust of rain, wind, 
244 and bluster.  Immedeately inside, he placed a shoulder to the door to keep the
245 cold outside, and closed the latch.  Turning to the bar , he became aware of a
246 most uncharacteristic quiet.  An atmosphere of mourning pervaded the fire-lit
247 room.  After warming himself at the fire and with an ale, the piper in a 
248 quiet conversation, discovered that the innkeeper was thinking of retiring
249 and closing the inn.  Standing at the bar for a time, the piper became aware
250 of the signs of fatigue.  He realized that he and the other patrons could come
251 and go as they chose, but the innkeeper was always tied to his post.  The 
252 gossamer webs of obligations undertaken thicken, in time, to heavy chains of
253 bondage to others' will.  Leaning over the counter, he spoke softly.
254   "My friend, you must do what you feel is right for yourself.  You have given
255 of yourself in full measure.  If the fun goes away, if the magic loses it's
256 allure, then you may be right to depart.  We will miss you, should you go.
257 Should this be simply a minor irritation, please do not over-react.  You have
258 a tremendiously supportive group here -- but again, you must do what is right
259 for yourself.  None of us *really* understand the effort it takes to maintain
260 the inn -- but, it cannot be much less taxing than raising animals.  My largest
261 caution is, perhaps this system has gotten to be too much a part of you --
262 you might just want to take a vacation -- see if two weeks without the  inn 
263 makes it better or worse.
264 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

266 Hello all.  I, too, was hurt by the
267 knowledge that The Inn would be taken
268 away from us.  I mostly read, but I never
269 have a dull moment here.  After A lot of homework dealing mostly with chemistry, trig, or whatever, I find it most 
270 relaxing to come here to escape.

273      One cannot always be sure what is fact and what is fiction around these
274 parts. Since the messages signed by CISTOP MIKEY have, in the past, been in
275 the fact category I feel obliged to respond accordingly.
276 
277      Mike, this is not a plea to ask you to make or change your decisions to
278 correspond to the desires of myself or the other patrons of the Inn. If you
279 feel that it's time for a change in your life, only you can decide what new
280 course to follow. I would like to suggest that anger may not be a sound basis
281 for making decisions. Having gone through a similar experience I certainly
282 sympathize with your feelings.
283      During the years I have frequented the Backwater, (yes, I have been
284 around since very near the beginning, under various pen names) it has been a
285 source of great enjoyment, relaxation, and sometimes learning for me. You
286 have many reasons to be proud of the way you have operated the Inn. Know that
287 whatever the outcome the Backwater Inn will live on in the minds of myself
288 and others. Please accept my thanks and an I.O.U. for a debt that I probably
289 can never repay.
290      May you find happiness along your chosen path!

294 Mikey: Those of us who are long time patrons of your marvelous
295 Inn appreciate what you have done here. I know the McKane 
296 adventure, and the medium that made it possible, helped me 
297 maintain my spirits during a very difficult time.
298 
299 Those of us who followed the ups and downs of backwater can
300 certainly appreciate your frustrations. I've often been 
301 amazed that you've had the determination to keep such an 
302 outstanding board going for so long. 
303 
304 Considering the work, expense, and time that Backwater must
305 involve I can certainly understand how you would have times
306 when you'd just like to flick it in. I hope you decide to 
307 stick it out. Backwater is something you should really be 
308 proud of. I hope you find it worth your time to continue it.

318      "My God, Salazar, did you hear the news?  Mikey wants to shut down
319 the Inn."  Mohammed said.
320      Salazar shook his head sadly.  "Yes, what's the world coming to?  If
321 the Inn disappears, our reality is lost."
322     "I can't believe it.  McKane must be behind this."
323     "We'll just have to wait and see.  Perhaps it's a giant hoax."
324     "I certainly hope so."  Mohammed took another drink of grog.  "I even
325 heard that the Backwater was mentioned in Link-up magazine.  We were going
326 to hit the big time."
327      "Yes, and Pam hasn't shown up.  Maybe she could talk him into keeping
328 the Inn open.  Either she or 'd' could do it, I'm sure."
329      Our heroes lapsed into a morose silence.  The once joyful Inn was fille
330 d with the moans and whimpers of its miserable patrons.

343      "No, come the end of the year, I'm closing shop.  I'm just tired, tired
344 of the whole thing, sick of cleaning up after fools.  I've had it, that's
345 the end."  The Innkeeper sighed.  The pressure of his work was obvious from 
346 the strain that caused his normally jovial, booming tenor voice to fade away
347 toward the end of his sentence.
348 
349      "Good Innkeeper, certainly it isn't as bad as that!" I respond, and the
350 gay laugh that accompanies the happy tone of my words belies the heavyness
351 that weighs down my heart.  "I realize that some of our patrons lack a
352 certain... maturity.  And the energy expended in running your establishment
353 at no monetary gain could be better utilized in more profitable persuits.
354 But to close the Inn... that would be... I mean...."  I suddenly
355 find myself at a loss for words to express how I feel.  What can I say to my
356 good friend?  How can I console him, lift his spirits, return a smile to his
357 face?  I know that no matter what I say, the ultimate choice is his alone.  
358 So, finally, I whisper, "You know my feelings about the Inn, its patrons,
359 and its keeper, so you must know that I hope your decision to close shop is 
360 revocable, that you'll stay open for business.  But whatever your final
361 decision may be, you have my support.  Totally and without question."
362 
363      I turn quickly from the bar, and hope that I can maintain some form of
364 dignity.  I feel like weeping, and the tears inside of me are formed from a
365 sweet combination of sorrow at the passing of this place that has come to be
366 a second home for me, and of rage that glows like a flame within my breast.
367 I have always tried to make the peace, to be a voice of reason amidst the
368 strident discord that has often filled the Inn to the rafters, but today I
369 cannot bring peace or reason.  I feel a need to lash out, to strike at these
370 barbarous cretins who may have brought an end to this delightful house.
371 
372      Through the scarlet anger that clouds my vision I suddenly see that an
373 old friend, one Salazar, has once again come to the Inn.  He sits with a man
374 that I remember as a Mr. Wassir, whom I met once in order to clear up a case
375 of mistaken identity.  It had been rumored that Leroy McKane had attempted
376 to perform some dastardly deed upon my person (kidnapped, I think it was),
377 and both he and Salazar had most graciously aided in correcting the error,
378 though I often wondered who it was that McKane had taken and if she had made
379 it out safely.  I walk toward the table and sit.  By the stunned looks on
380 their faces, I can safely assume that they have also heard the news.
381 
382      "Good evening, gentlemen," I say as I slump down in the chair that Mr.
383 Salazar has offered, "I'm sorry that we had to meet again on such an unhappy
384 occasion."  We speak for awhile, small-talk really, with large silences
385 intersperced throughout the conversation as we search for words that do not
386 come easily.  Finally, after an extremely long silence that none of us has
387 attempted to break, my anger reaches a peak and overwhelms me.  I grab the
388 glass on the table before me, throw it against the hearth to smash loudly,
389 and climb onto the table.  The Inn has become completely silent at this, and
390 I see many looks of surprise when the source of the outburst becomes
391 apparent.
392 
393      "Ladies and gentlemen," I begin, "I now present to you a sight you've
394 never beheld before, and from the looks of things may never behold again!  I
395 am filled with such anger, such rage, that I feel that I must speak or I
396 will die of a stroke!  To whomever has brought about this turn of events, I
397 curse you!  You scabrous, pot-marked little vermin, you disgusting foul-
398 mouthed, snot-nosed brat, may you rot for what you've done.  It's Over!!!!"
399 I yell, then slowly return to my chair.  "It's over." I sadly whisper.

408 reading all the fine writers who use this board as thier 'meeting of

415 I had to give the following a bit of editing to fit the current frame of things
416 
417 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     Episode II          -the next step-
418      Although uncertain of my path, I thought it would be safe to give my feet
419 a rest at The INN. Although I only had the few coins I was sent away with, that
420 would be enough for a stew and cider before I would have to leave.
421      Being on my own, things took on a new dimension. The color of the trees by
422 the side of the road seemed more brilliant... but not changed. The air semmed
423 colder-  maybe even a bit sweeter, but not really changed.
424      As I came closer to The INN it seemed older, and not so strongly 
425 constituted as I had remembered...  Prehaps the cold was playing tricks on my
426 mind, for I had not noticed the dark cloud hanging over The INN, either, as if
427 by some underhanded bane.
428      Standing by what was now a barren tree, I had arrived at The INN's door
429 and could barely read the inscription on it, it said something like
430 ^`  If you are in need of help, you need but ask...  '^     As I reached for
431 the door, my hand faultered. This *was* an inn, and how would the clients of
432 the establishment respond to the entrance of one so young into thier company?
433 Oh sure, my elder brother had ventured here alone at times, but he was twice my
434 age and had a habit of telling tall stories of someone called `the Piper'...
435      My hesitation was ended by a brisk wind that chilled to the bone and the
436 sound of Edric's voice within my head. It said, "Choose, Commit, and be
437 Steadfast!"  Before I could ponder on this, I had already pulled the door open
438 and began to go inside.
439      Upon my entrance only a few eyes turned my way as a man by the hearth
440 raised his voice as he stood.
441      "All rise as we give tribute to our unthanked friends!"
442 At that, he and all others turned my way.

457 **************************************************************
458 I am quite taken aback by the show of support and concern. 
459 I am sorry for the upset and worry I have caused many of you.
460 My temper has once more lead to more problems then solutions.
461 Please forgive my outburst, it was the end result of a long
462 string of negative occurances in the previous two days. I will
463 not go into them as they are private, but the end point came
464 after getting home and having to spend several hours cleaning
465 up the mess left on a disk. Some of it I really didn't want
466 to delete, as it was only marginally outside the bounds of
467 reasonability, but past experience (and indeed it was held out 
468 by the results of the very disk involved) has shown me that it
469 leads to far worse problems, and to stave off any problems, I
470 felt it prudent to remove it. This bothered me, but I felt it
471 was necessary for overall peace. But then a message was left 
472 indicating that it was a dictitorial (non-reasoning) reaction.
473 This hurt, as it rubbed salt into the wound I had inflicted
474 on myself. Then came a message that indicated that I didn't
475 know how to run my own BBS. This was the final straw causing 
476 the dam to break releasing all the pent up anger and frustration 
477 of the past two days. 
478 
479 No, BackWater will NOT go away. I will relent, and continue to 
480 provide for its existance. Fear not, for even if I were to
481 give up entirly, I am sure a good home can be found for it.
482 
483 Again, I apologize for the disruption I have caused you
484 by my unrestrained temper. And now, back to work. sigh...

487 Mikey: As one of many, who has spend uncounted hours of enjoyment due to
488 your favor, I thank you sincerely for your decision to remain a while longer.
489 But, I've seen evidence that running BackWater is not always as much fun for
490 you as it is for us.  One of these occasions will be the one that breaks the
491 camels back, as they say.  As I enjoy your board too much to willingly face
492 this possiblility, I wonder:
493 Is there anything that we, your loyal patrons, can do to ease your burden?
494 Financial contributions, or babysitting the BackWater for a day or more
495 while you get a vacation from it, or..??  I'm sure that you would have no lack of
496 willing hands.  In any case, I hope the responses of so many, all thru this
497 disk (even the lurkers!) helps to give you some idea of what this board and
498 your efforts mean to us.
499                               Thank you.

507         "Do not try anything, mortal. Obey this last command, and you are
508 free to go."
509         I nodded, wondering if the genie would understand. Apparently it
510 did, for it began returning to the bottle. The genie lost all definition,
511 as it was sucked into the opening of the bottle, that I had placed back
512 in the sand after cleaning. Just before the genie's form had disappeared
513 into the bottle completely, my head again was invaded by its voice.
514         "Remember mortal. Believe what you see, even if its unbelievable.
515 Don't forget for a moment that I ever existed. Forget me, forget yourself.
516 Learn from this, be the wiser..."
517         I corked the bottle, and grabbing it with my right hand, ran to the
518 ocean edge. One last look at the bottle that now glistened. The sky had
519 opened up, just a bit. Enough for the sun to make a brief appearance. I
520 threw the bottle with all my might. It landed behind a wave. The wave passed,
521 but the bottle was gone.
522         I walked backed to the spot on the beach, fell to the sand, and
523 closed my eyes. I don't know how long I slept, but when I awoke, it was
524 starting to get dark, and the tide was just starting to come in. Was it all a
525 dream? Yes! That's it. A dream! I decided to take a nap here on the beach.
526 No one ever comes by here this time of year. It was all a dream! No bottle,
527 no genie. No wishes. Only dreams...nightmares... I got up, brushed the sand
528 off, and started off for my car.
529         "What's that?", I said, spying a white object lying on the ground.
530 It was a small square of silk, a little dirty, but of very fine quality.

532 *_)#*^)_#$*^#$
533 Mike : What can we say, but thanks! Your efforts for the past few years go above and beyond what anyone could reasonably
534        ask. Backwater has been a gem of precious stone in a gravel pit world. So much of us owe so much to you. You have
535        given us a place to sit and talk and discuss the universe. The archives serve a good reminder of the wonderful
536        times we had in the past here at the inn. Thanks to you, there will be a future to plan and partake in now too.
537        I owe this place so much. I have met so many new people and so many new friends, as well as one of my employers,
538        and now you have given me a chance to strut my stuff on a Sanyo! Ha! I would certainly like to second voyeur's call,
539        and if there is anyway we can ever help you out, you need but ask. See you at PCS, maybe some of the BW contingent
540        can chip in and get you a pizza. To close as L'homme would say, "Merci beaucoup!"

544      I had just gotton to work and  logged in to see what was going
545 on with BW and saw Mikey's opening message. You would not belive the
546 shiver that started in my shoulders and worked it's way down, leaving
547 my tiny brain dumb. And then scores of support from backwater patrons
548 expressing support and hope. PAM- great entry, my thoughts exactly.
549 Just when I was begginng to lose all hope and think about killing my
550 charictor (spelling?) off again, we get a stay of exucution. WHEWW!!
551 This was a truely great disk to read, everyone on good behaviour.

557 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
558   From Prometheus; Gratefull
559   CISTOP MIKEY; My deepest and sincerist thanks to you for all the trials and tribulations with which you deal with for BW and
560 it's users.  This is not an easy task to say the least, and yet you still perceviere through hundreds of lines of twit lines.
561   All I cqn do is give my thanks to you, and offer my assistance or aid in almost any manner to keep Backwater going.  I am an
562 easy person to manipuate, I woud be at least satasfactory in many capacities, the easiest of which is partly funding BW.
563   While sorting through Twit Lines, please remember that with this system you have acheived a greater goal that every ysop
564 dreams of for his system.
565   BW is all of those analogies mentioned before, but more over, it is intelligent, witty, emotional, and compelling.  To name
566 very few of the adjectives one could use...
567 
568    Assorted messages follow, which is predictable, is it not?
569  
570   Man in Gray; Kendall is sending me pictures of him wearing tight dresses now, and says he's going to be in Portland for a
571 week next month, and he'd like to see me.  When did you say that Montana technological conference was? Next month? Great!
572   If I was going to have to deal with them next month, I would try putting him and Retch in a small room for a while.
573   And by the way, Retch found the panel in the Black Van. You know, the one that isn't mentioned in the design sheets.
574   I think he might just soon figuire out what all the cables and line splices might be for, and he already knows we do some
575 maintenance for microwave repeaters on Mount Hood.  I thinkk we might have to disconnect him from the vans for a while, no
576 matter if he does want to take Kendall out one night...
577   I got the ANTEATER 450 ammo, but the 460 is missing a firing pin.  Don't you remember, we took it out when we gave it to him
578 back in Idaho?
579   I hocked some of the SKORPION timing gear to pay for it, but the Broker is gonna find out about the ammo tester and that it
580 doesn't diagnose carburateur difficulties like I said it did.
