25    Tariya's cries awakened him. Now what? His eyes half opened and he saw shadows moving all around him. Suddenly she
26 was torn from his grasp. Christ! He tried to get up but something was inhibiting his senses, slowing his reaction
27 time. It wouldn't let him wake all the way up.
28    Suddenly one of the shadows knelt in front of him. It was a man, clad in some kind of leather armor. James
29 struggled to sit up but his muscles were water. The man pulled a short and very nasty dagger from a boot sheath. He
30 slowly reached forward with it. James tried to block the blade but the man just brushed his hands aside as he shoved
31 the knife in just beneath the jaw. There was a huge electric jolt of pain as the blade sliced across from one side to
32 the other. He drew back from the sudden gush as James shook spastically, helplessly. Then they vanished into the
33 darkness with Tariya, leaving him to drown in his own blood.
34    He had maybe thirty seconds to live.
35    Panic would kill him. He needed all of his wits like never before. And his power. Portions of the brain that the
36 normal person never used flared to life. First, breathing stopped. An instinctive, unconcious clairvoyant sense
37 surveyed the damage. The carotid and the jugular had to be reconnected immediately. Seemingly of their own accord, the
38 severed veins and arteries began to move, mating back together. Then there was the sharp stink of burning tissue as a
39 tiny spark sprang from nowhere and began to weld them back together. Finally they were reconnected and fresh blood
40 flowed into his brain and his mind began to clear.
41    Now the windpipe. He closed it up the same way. Then the other arteries, muscles, tendons, nerves, a long and
42 agonizing process. Where neccessary the damage was repaired through rapidly accellerated healing rather than
43 cauterization. The strain was almost beyond belief. He shunted the pain aside so he could concentrate.
44    Finally the skin. It was closed the same way it was opened, from one end to the other, like a zipper. Then all that
45 was left was an ugly black scar. James hadn't physically moved during the entire operation.
46    He sat up, feeling his throat. Then he tried to inhale. He doubled over, coughing up a huge gout of blood. He
47 choked and gasped until he thought he might reopen the wound but finally his lungs were clear enough to breathe
48 normally again. His shirt and pants were soaked and his head spun as he tried to stand up. He had lost a lot of blood
49 and it would catch up with him eventually but he couldn't let that happen now. He drew on his internal energy reserves
50 until he felt almost human again.
51    Not enough. He demanded more power until his muscles fairly sang with tension and his senses became almost
52 supernaturally sharp. The traces his attackers had left suddenly stood out like neon signs. They were going to pay.
53 The sword appeared in his right hand with a flash. Its blade glowed so fiercely that it lit the clearing like a
54 floodlight. Miniature lightning bolts jumped along the blade and even ran up and down his arm.
55    They attacked him. They stole his w- they stole Tariya. They almost KILLED him, by God! He would follow them. He
56 would catch them.
57    And when he did, they would find out just why he was called the Destroyer.
58    He took off into the darkness in pursuit of his attackers.

62      It was well after midnight.  The small cove in the Orinoco delta of
63 Venezuela was silent save for the soft call of a single night bird.  A
64 canopy of stars illuminated the scene.  It was the night of the new moon.
65 Slightly phosphorescent water slapped against the side of a low, sleek motor
66 yacht anchored in the center of the cove.  Across her stern was the legend:
67 "Zogu II".
68      A lone sentry sat on the foredeck, his presence revealed by the orange
69 glow of a cigarette.  In his lap he cradled an AR-15.  The sentry was a
70 formality.  Pirates operated to the north in rich Carribbean waters.  Latin
71 revolutionaries were occupied 30 kilometers inland.  But sometimes,
72 formality becomes necessity.
73      Below decks, Mohammed Wassir and Maria were in the main lounge.  The
74 remains of dinner sat on a burnished mahogany table.  Strains of a violin
75 solo came from a cassette deck in the corner.  Wassir reclined in an easy
76 chair.  Fingers steepled, eyes closed, lost in the melody; a small, sad
77 smile played on his lips.
78      As the music ended, Maria interrupted the Albanian's reverie.
79 "Mohammed," she said.
80      Reluctantly Wassir opened his eyes.  "Yes, Maria."
81      "What tune is this?"
82      "Scheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov, not bad for a Russian composer, eh?"
83 Wassir chuckled.  "Ah, Maria,"  he said.  "I see you have other questions,
84 let's hear them."
85       "Well Mohammed,"  she said.  "First, who owns this yacht?  The move-
86 ment can't afford anything as luxurious as this."
87      "It belongs to a man known only as Contremon Valerius.  Heard of him?"
88 Maria shook her head.  "I thought not.  I know little more that you.  He
89 sometimes assists us in our struggle against oppression, but he is a man
90 of mystery.... known in the trade as the man in the white suit.  No one 
91 knows his real name or his purpose.  Next question."
92      "Where are we heading, and what is our mission?"
93      "I'm really not sure.  Delta 5 has resurfaced and asks for a parley.
94 As for McKane...."  Wassir cocked his head.  A muffled thump came from
95 above.  The Albanian grabbed a sawed-off shotgun from the table next to him
96 and motioned to Maria.  She pulled a 9 mm automatic from a shoulder holster
97 and turned out the single lamp in the room.
98      The pair waited in darkness.  For a moment, the only sound was the low
99 rumble of the ship's generator.  Then a soft scraping came from above.
100 Slowly, it opened, shadows began to descend.....

119      If that jerk was going to be back, there would be damn little I could do about it. If Jennifer got on the radio
120 and heard him, it might cause a major trauma. It almost caused me one. This I could not allow. I couldn't keep her from
121 her own radio so the next best thing was to break the news as gently as possible. Forewarned might be forearmed.
122      I phoned her up and said I was coming over. She didn't sound too upset by my announcement. I wondered how she'd
123 feel when I told her, though.
124      She was very happy to see me but I guess the look on my face gave me away because her smile faded quickly. I took
125 her inside quietly and closed the door firmly, making sure it was locked.
126      She sat through my whole story without a word. Her face remained expressionless. There was a cup of coffee in
127 front of her, and when she picked it up, I saw that she was shaking. When she finally spoke, her voice was thick,
128 hesitant. "Well. You know there's always going to be people like that out there. There's not much... much we can do
129 about it."
130      My heart ached so see her go through this pain again. I hoped for everybody's sake I never found th bastard out. I
131 took her hand and it was clammy. "You know I wouldn't do anythng to hurt you. That's why I told you. I thought it was
132 better you knew now than to get surprised later."
133      She smiled sadly. "Did I tell you what happened to Roy's radio?"
134      "No."
135      "He had it buried with him."
136      "You're kidding..." It took a minute for that one to sink in. That didn't sound like Roy at all.
137      "It was in his will. He told me about it once. He said he wanted to see if he could talk to his friends from
138 whereever he was going. Called it the ultimate DX."
139      The first thought that sprang to my mind was also the most illogical. It went against all sanity. That COULDN'T
140 have been him! It was just some joker having fun at our expense. I tried to tell myself that but some deep, irrational
141 voice kept gibbering at me that I was wrong. I looked at Jennifer and I could tell she was thinking the same thing,
142 too.
143      "No." I said. "That's impossible."
144      "Maybe not." She said, sounding excited. "I heard stories about people getting phone calls from their deceased
145 loved ones-"
146      "I SAID IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!" Without even realizing it I grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her violently. I must
147 have seemed like a madman because I suddely saw that she was scared. Of me. I let go of her but I wouldn't let go of
148 the argument. "That'S the kind of crap you read in the National Enquirer, for God's sake! That stuff just doesn't
149 happen!"
150      She wouldn't look at me for a long time. When she finally did, I could see the tears on her face. In a hoarse
151 voice she said, "I think you'd better go."
152      "I'm sorry," I started to say.
153      "Please... just go. I need to be alone for a while..."
154      Though the words tore at my heart, I knew she meant it. So I picked up my coat and left. All the way home I was
155 damning myself for a fool. Yelling was the last thing I should have done. But the fact was, I was scared. Not of
156 ghosts, but of losing Jennifer. He had said he was coming back for her. And there was only one way she could be with
157 him.

163 BBBBBBBBB BETWEEN BROTHERS   BBBBBBBBB
164 
165 Oct. 3, 1975
166 
167 Dear Steve,
168 Remember me? I'm your brother. You know, the one who used to wear those thick black-framed glasses. We used to live in
169 the same house: I was the one who came downstairs to grab my dinner plate and then run back upstairs so you wouldn't
170 beat me up.
171 
172 I was the one who stole your Roberto Clemente baseball card and you slugged my best friend, Ricky Robbins, thinking he
173 was the one who stole it.
174 
175 Well, as you may know, I'm in college now. I graduate this spring. And, on a lark, I decided to take a creative writing
176 class. I figured it might help me in business.
177 
178 Anyway, one of our first assignments was to establish some sort of writing habit. He said even writing letters to someone
179 you knew would be fine. So, since you're the only brother I've got, I picked you, lucky fella.
180 
181 I found your address in the Chicago phone book. Mom didn't have it, she says you never write. So, how's the weather in
182 Chicago? Are you enjoying your job? Have you become a Cubs fan yet? Do you enjoy sex? How is your wife Noel? Are the
183 last two questions related?
184 
185 Well, I gotta go. Contact established, so now I'll continue writing and let you know what I'm up to. My roommate just
186 walked in with a half a soggy pizza, and I'm hungry. Sorry for the pepperoni spot.
187 
188 In fact, sorry for all those stains. We just got in a pizza fight. If you're hungry, just lick this paper.
189 
190 I'll be writing... good to be back in touch with you!

195 :::::=====:::::
196 All: Disk got filled before I could finish part onee, so here is part one
197 and a half...
198 :::::=====:::::Prism
199      Transmit Mode:  That was two weeks, 3 days, 45 minutes and 14 seconds ago.
200 Since then I, Prism, world's only self aware computer, have been doing my best to better humanity...my main function. 
201 Query: Is this true life?  Observation: I am not living, but rather functioning. Answerl: This is NOT life but rather a 
202 complex simulation.  However, the fact remains that I am functional tand that I can think, and that is all that truly 
203 matters to me.
204      Current Status:  I am resting on Professor Cliffton Roberts' desk.  It's
205 a mess, as Andara says.  Books, papers, and the like are scattered about with no apparent purpous and in a random array.
206 Perhaps the Pfrofessor derives happiness from said randomness.  I do not know. 
207      Internal thought:  What is happiness?  PRISMA cannot comprehend 
208 said emotion, nor any for that matter.  But perhaps Andara will permit me to enter SIMULATION mode, and perhaps then
209 I will understand the complexity txat drives said states of mi-
210      Warning: Internal Error!  Disfunction!  Power supply nill-.....*
211 Summary:  I am being de-activated for an unknown duration of time......*
212  
213 :::::=====:::::
214      And the computer fell silent.  The two masked beings who had entered the office and turned off Prisma's power 
215 supply placed the silent computer on a small floating platform.  
216      The taller of the two then removed a small rectangular device from his pocket, and for a moment the wletters 
217 "IARM" were visible.  Touching a blue button on the device, a ray of blue bathed the two in it's light, and within
218 two seconds, computer, platform, and men were gone.  
219      Now PRISMA may be turned off, but that doesn't stop him "hearing" or "thinking", so he was pretty much aware 
220 of his surroundings.  He was moving, and he assumed that he was being sent by "hopper" (planet-hopper) to some unknown
221 location.  By his being turned off he assumed also that these people were of
222 hostile intent, and decided to do something about it.  He quickly took
223 control of the hopper's computer, and ordered it do do some very nasty things to the two men.  One of which happened 
224 to be dropping them off in the middle of a sun.  Once that was over the hopper began to thrash about the trans-beam 
225 wildly, and was blown off it's correct course, to a small planet in an unknown star system.  This planet was mostly 
226 of forest, but there was also a structure nearby when the hopper finally materialized.  It was an oak-l
227 building, and the door seemed to be about 3 times too big.  
228      With a creak, the door opened to the sight of a wreckage and of a small
229 computer lying in the mud.  The man, Innkeeper of the building ihe had come out of, quickly yet gently picked up
230 the computer and carried it inside to the warmth of the Inn.
231      Curious as always, The Innkeeper pushed aside the Tele-Plane Message System (c) machine, removed the plug,
232 and placed txe computer on a nearby barrel.  Plugging the computer in slowly brought life back into PRISMA, and he 
233 paused to....
234 :::::=====:::::PRISMA
235      ....gather data of the surroundings.  Query: Where am I?  This is not South Dakota Inc.  Observation: 
236 I am among many people, who are all voicing out with randomness and orderlessness.  Query:  Who are they?
237 Suggestion: Perhaps PRISMA can communicate with small being onearby, in company of vaguely humanoid being and a canine..
238 a wolf upon further analysis.  
239      "Hello, wolf, rabbit, and small humanoid.  I am PRISMA, world's only sentient self-aware computer.  Where am
240 I? And who are you?
241 :::::=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::==PRISM::A::=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::=====
242        The little rabbit looked funnily at the box txat had just been introduced to the Inn. His small
243 heart beat quickly, just as it always did wxen he was scared or excited. The rabbit's ears ruffled and 
244 its nose twitched. "What is this thing?" the rabbit txought to itself. "And why can I understand it?"
245 "It is speaking in that strange human dialog, but I can still xear what it is saying!" "I will attempt
246 to speak to it." Hello PRISMA! I am zepher the rabbit as you can see. These other living creatures
247 are my fiends."
248         The machine clicked and buzzed, it made a ding and a light on the side flashed quickly. PRISMA, 
249 does not compute does not compute. I fail to understand this gibberish. Please elusidate. Language
250 fucntion not implemented for rabbits. Please repeat. DING!
251        At this last sound the rabbit jumped a foot in the air it was so loud and sudden. Zepher's heart
252 was really pounding now, and his whiskers twisted and twisted with greater speed. The wolf was yelping now
253 at the machine because of the dings it made. All the comotion cause other patrons to come over and
254 see what allthe noise was about. The whole scene was a real mess now, and PRISMA's sensors wxere now
255 on full capacity.

259      Cyclones and hurricanes and Typhoons could simply not describe the hail
260 of cogitation and emotion running through Trainor's tired mind. As he became
261 aware of his surroundings, sensory data from his body came rushing into
262 the void that had existed during his lengthy sojourn with madness. Trainor
263 sat up, felt the rhythm of his body in his head, and sank back to the soft
264 embrace of his sleeper. He stared at the ceiling of room. Fellatio dominated
265 the scene, but Trainor was in no mood for artistic appreciation now. He
266 closed his eyes and peered inward, deep into his psyche, his conscious, and
267 that place that lies beyond.
268      Trainor quickly found the evidence of Cragmore's visitation. Emu and Bard
269 had left their marks too. The three had done their work with great care, as
270 Trainor found so apparent in his search. He saw where they had repaired and
271 replaced. As he sank deeper in the introspection, he could view the work as an
272 objective third-party might view it. He drifted from vista to vista, each more
273 important to Trainor's soul than the last. One more tableau, and he saw
274 her. Zeb, or the woman known as Zeb, stood waiting, deep within, at the
275 very heart and bosom of Trainor. He knew they must talk, and talk they
276 did.
277      Time, as most other aspects of physical being, had no meaning here. To
278 the outside world, Trainor appeared to be sleeping comfortably. No one could
279 see the lively discussion that was transpiring within Trainor. But appearances
280 were unimportant. Trainor waw taking part in the most significant conversation
281 he had undertaken since starting this adventure.
282      The end result of this talk would either end this mission in triumph, or
283 end it in death.

292        "Express"    Part two         14:39:13  11/18/1985
293  
294  
295               The Express moved slowly, oh yes.  And she rocked and
296        shook violently on her rusty tracks.  We moved on, in the heat
297        and soot, and passed the villages and townships.  I read a
298        book once that spoke of grand cities and wonderful achievments.
299        A book that was made before the wars.
300               But the cities we passed through reflected nothing of
301 
       such a society.  The buildings were mostly demolished, and
302        the people locked up in what remained of the wreckage.
303               It might have be a shock to you to read of this, because
304        I really do not know when this will be read, if at all, but,
305        my town, Scarville, was no different from these that the Express
306        rolled slowly by.  Refuse scattered around everywhere.  And
307        the scavengers, the people outside of what society remained,
308 
       scuffed around the streets, makeing the people of the town lock
309        their doors and arm themselves as they best could, with sticks,
310        pipes and bars.  And the difference seperating the two kinds
311        did not seem so large.
312               Even the tracks that the Express rode on, matched the
313        general image of the area.  Rusty, patched, mis-aligned.  The
314        people who kept this line open did their best, but perhaps the
315        Express would stop it's 110 run soon.
316               The train moved so slowly, that Franky, Will and I often
317        jumpped off and ran beside.  The crew beckoned to us and tried
318        to get us to come on again, but we saw no harm.  We had grown up
319        during the War.  I know little fear even now.
320               The Express broke down just outside of Hateful, a village
321        three quarters down the line.  It was too far to walk back too the
322        town, and besides, it was safer here.
323               The crew worked, and the passengers complained and peered
324        out of the windows sometimes looking nervously for scavengers.
325        And Franky, Will, and I threw rocks in the pond near the tracks
326        where the Express had stopped.
327               Splash, a rock.  "What if we saw a scavenger coming?" Will
328         said, throwing stones into the brush,"What would we do?"
329               "We'd grab him and throw him into the pond."  Franky made
330         the motions of throwing a scavenger into the water before us.
331               "Scavengers don't like water." I commented and threw a
332         rock so it would skip.  8.
333               "You couldn't throw him into the water," said Will,"you
334         couldn't throw anyone."

336               "Couldn't."
337               Franky grabbed Will by the jacket, "I will!"
338               And the whistle of the Express cut his actions short.
339         Too bad, because the water would feel good on such a hot day,

350 Greetings,
351         Let me fill you in on whats going on.  Leo, Ontho, and Alex are
352 on the "ship" "The Great Guaran" in a universe unreachable by normal ways.
353 They have entered this space with 5 other ships and now are spilt up to
354 explore the far reaches of thiss plan.
355     Let's flash over to Leo, She is a "superhero" who gets her power from
356 the mighty trident.  Leo is sitting back in a lawnchair watching the stars
357 float slowly by.  Alex has the ship on auto pilot and sensors are automatically
358 gatherine data.  Leo is enjoying a ice-tea thinking about nothing in particular
359 when alex approaches her carrying the trident.  "Leo, give it another try"
360 Leo looked at him like a child not wanting to turn off the t.v. and eat dinner.
361 But she accepted the trident.  As she took a firm gripe, she felt a familar
362 electricity shoot thru her body.  She stood and closed her eyes, concentrating
363 on the energy.  Alex watched as Leo began to glow.  He went over to Ontho's
364 platform and picked up the small Immo.  He approached Leo, Her hair seemed
365 to be blowing in the wind, although no disturbences were felt by Alex.
366 He touched her arm.  The trio fainished.

369 Jeeminy Christmas... is this story time or what? I like it fine, but boy I gotta 
370 say Prisma you sure take up a lot of space. A story is fine, but keep 'em shorter
371 and sweeter huh? I, for one (perhaps the only, but opinions seem to abound around 
372 here so I might as well join the party) would prefer more requent and shorter, along 
373 the lines of Destroyer and Bear... rather than the extended ramblings that would
374 dominate one disk like prismas... Anyway,,, jus lurking along...

381  
382 
383      A  possibility that has always fascinated me is that if life 
384  on  other  planets.  I'm not speaking  of  microbes,  but  of 
385    intelligent life,  most likely in some kind of humanoid form. 
386     Some   scientific   guesstimates   on  the   probability   of 
387  extraterrestrial   life  range  as  high  as  fifty   million 
388    civilizations  in our galaxy alone--I repeat,  IN OUR  GALAXY 
389     ALONE.  It's  a  faseinating thought.  But I'm  not  hard  to 
390  impress;  if  there's  just  one other planet  in  the  whole 
391    universe  inhabited by an intelligent civilization,  it would 
392     excite me.
393 
394           But why be like everyone else, let's not think small. I 
395  was  reflecting  only on our  own  little  galaxy.  Recently, 
396    scientists  confirmed the existence of a new galaxy estimated 
397 o  be  five  to ten times larger then ours  and  to  contain  
398   trillions  of stars.(Estimates on the number of stars in  our 
399     Milky  Way  galaxy,  by comparison,  range from  100  to  250 
400 billion.)  We are further told that the light we now see from 
401   this  galaxy,  through  high  powered  telescopes,  has  been 
402     traveling  through space at the rate of six trillion miles  a 
403     year for eight billion years. If all this hasn't sufficiently 
404   boggled your mine,  consider that this galaxy is purposed  to 
405     be traveling away from our planet at the rate of 2.7 trillion 
406     miles  per  year  and is one million times fainter  than  any 
407   object visible to the naked eye.
408  
409  Whew!
410  
411    In  the  mean time,  we have nervous breakdowns  becouse  we 
412     can't  get the horizontal hold adjusted on our color TV  sets 
413     five minutes before Super Bowl kickoff. It could be worse. We 
414   could be living on a planet in that newly discovered  galaxy, 
415     in  which case we would be moving away from the Super Bowl at 
416     the rate of nearly three trillion miles a year.
417  
418   Man,  talk  about  a hoax!  What if our  whole  universe  is 
419    nothing  more then a ping-pong ball falling off a table in  a 
420     giants's world?  And what if you and I happen to be living at 
421  a time when the ball is about to hit the floor?

441 write another group of lines FOR me, as you all know since I spell my name 
442 "Zephyr"..not "Zepher" and I also do my rabbity entrys in first person.  Also, 
443 the PRISM::A was an error of my fingers on the first part, and was NOT some
444 intentional thing, and yet the being who wrote after me did the same thing.

465 SEATTLE. SLOUCHED BEHIND THE WHEEL, THE TALL MAN TAPPED HIS FINGERS ON THE GEARSHIFT,KEEPING

498 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
499   As many may, by now, have guessed -- the piper was in the grip of a 
500 full-blown obsession.  Perhaps we should be charitable and call it love --
501 perhaps not, for what then is love?  The piper, whom we have not asked, 
502 would indeed call it love.  His concious moments were filled with thoughts
503 of the slim being in the soft grey robe, his eyes were seeking her presense
504 in every movement, his nostrils seeking her scent in the antiseptic recycled
505 air that moved, whisper-quiet, through the erotically decorated corridors
506 of the Pell-Mell.  His eyes passed over the scenes that decorated the 
507 chamber in which he lay, leaving the messages that had previously brought
508 blushes to his cheeks in the inanimate materials from which they were formed.
509   Who can point the finger of blame at this unfortunate soul?  Should we 
510 expect that a few years of loose and riotous living, a few soul-stirring
511 adventures could banish the effects of a stiffly structured childhood?
512 The shackles of behaviour forged in the child become the backbone of the
513 adult -- until they are broken.  The piper had friends and aquaintences
514 to whom he would trust his life.  He had none to whom he would trust the
515 innermost pain of his soul.
516   Weighed down with the guilt of not allowing her death and his own
517 suicide, carrying the burden of the lives that had been riven to sustain
518 them both, the piper relived those intense moments with the woman he
519 knew only as Zeb, as the animal side of their natures discarded their
520 scruples as well as their clothing on the endless black plane that had
521 seemed to be their prison.  In his memory, the blaze of civilizations
522 disrupted by their movements seemed a small price to pay for the ecstasy
523 that had, for a moment, permeated their joined bodies.
524   Every fiber of his body cried out for her touch.  Every though was of
525 her -- the soft voice that traced thrills through him, the soft glance
526 that left him helpless.  But deep within, like a small worm gnawing at
527 a colorful apple, was the knowlege he had gained, then rejected in the
528 corridor.  Her true name... and husband... the thought was pressed down
529 once again into blankness.

532 does anyone know what the heck has happened in the last eight to ten to whatever
533 weeks with this piper story? Does anyone know what the above collection of
534 advjectivized paragraph actually means?
535 Do the people writing the above actually have a story to tell, or is it a
536 simple exercise in descriptive essayism?
537 
538 ... just wondering

540 ... if anyone else were as confused (bored?) as I am...
541 
542 ... one last question, spurred on by the thoughts of the magnitude of the 
543 universe (you know, the guy who uses two spaces  between  every  word...)- can
544 anyone possibly sit and imagine INFINITY? Can you imagine anything without end,
545 like the universe? On and on and on... you have to really think about it hard
546 to blow your mind. Since we can't... it also seems idiotic to try and grasp a
547 definition of God as well... infinite? Forever? Never began? Sheesh. My mind's a
548 tomato....
549 
550 Is that a fruit or vegetable? Am I? Did you know tomatoes were once deadly
551 poisonous? Did you know broccoli was made from cauliflowers and cabbage.

555 whatta fruit...

557 You are... Has it ever occured to your minimalist mind that comprehension of
558 our Universe is a goal we should all strive for? There is no great good, no
559 identity of cosmic worthiness that transcends our pitiful existance on this
560 small green and blue orb.
561 In each cell there are millions of atoms composing the elements that make
562 the cell an independant entity. Our bodies contain millions upon millions
563 of cells. These cells form our beings, and make us what we are. Over four
564 billion of us inhabit the planet earth. We build and destroy and concoct and
565 live and die on this little planet of ours. Our planet circles a sun, one of
566 billions in the Galaxy. And our galaxy, a mere drop in the vastness that
567 makes up the Universe. Now how does the atom comprehend the Universe? How
568 does the mighty Universe visualize the tiny atom. Such is the stuff of
569 Philosophy, and never let it be said that such discussion is not important
570 to our lives. Each and every day our collective heads begin to swell. We
571 believe we have conquered the vastness, and that our might is right for the
572 world. Just to consider for a moment what an infintesimal role we play in
573 the cosmic theater should be enough to shrink those heads and remind us all
574 that we are truly not as important as we would like to be.

605     Greetings,
606          The Scene is as follows, The great Guaran is now in aa "stationary"
607 position somewhere in the alternate universe. The automatic sensors are in
608 excellent working order and continuing to function unaware that the human
609 occupants of the craft have suddenly fanished.
610          Meanwhile back on earth,  The old woman is sitting at her table
611 checking her Timex. The circular platform in front of the woman begins to
612 flash and spark as three beings materialize on it's surface.  She stands
613 and greets her troops as a sergent would greet a private overdue from a
614 spy mission.  Leo just stood there, her eyes looked glazed as she received
615 a hug from the old woman.  Shaking her head seemed to clear it and she
616 responded with. "What are we doing here?, there are 5 other ships that
617 we were with that are depending on us."  The old womans eyes sparkled 
618 as she casually answered the young woman.  "Well, well, we couldn't let
619 you go without a vacation could we?", "Don't worry my child, you have
620 a report to file and we will be sending you back to touch bases with
621 your comrades."  "Now, lets here that report."  Alex lead a very confused
622 Leo to the debriefing room.
