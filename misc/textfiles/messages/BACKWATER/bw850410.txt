21           It is quiet here in my dorm-room prison
22                where I contemplate the life we share.
23           I want to help, be there for you,
24                let my love shine through - do I dare?
25 
26           Fear tears at my heart, I am responsible...
27                the brave words I speak - are they wrong?
28           Will they end in bitterness and depression
29                and bring an end to our love song?
30 
31           I will speak my truth and open my heart...
32                I believe that with these seeds I sow,
33           You will discover your truth, open the blinds -
34                and with this love we will grow.

42   Hello! Anyone want to buy a pair of used 5" Micropolis DSDD normal-height
43 drives? I don't have any idea if they will work with an IBM PC compatible
44 or not (HEY CISTOP! if I brought them by the USD corporate complex could you
45 look at them?) but they do come with a Z80-based SBC for a controller. $75
46 for both if they turn out to odd typed, or $100 if they will work in an IBM.
47 or BRO. or whatever....

54      The warmth provided by the sun as it jouneyed across the sky was a godsend
55 welcomed greatly by this impoverished man.  The only sign that he was out of
56 sorts was the gruff of a beard that was now begininning to form on his chin and
57 the ruffle of his unkept hair.  Other than that, his appearance was not on the
58 whole unpleasing.
59      The name of the street that he crossed had finally sunk in, it was where
60 he intended to go.  ORCHARD RD was a name he would not soon forget, or so he 
61 wished.  Twisting his way through the streets of the city was not an easy task,
62 but managable.  At last, he found himself at the familiar gate to the house of
63 his old friend.  A dog met him at the gate and began to jump and bark gaily as
64 he pushed his way through to the front door of the house, a short stroll.
65      "Hello, great Blue. An And how fare you these cruel days?"
66 Blue just continued to bark and jump all the way to the front door with him.
67 After a quick rap at the door, it would be just moments before he would find 
68 out whether or not he would be welcome company here any longer.  The door began
69 to open slowly.  A woman had answered the door this time.
70      "Hello?...  Lewis, is that you?  Why, it is.  Lewis!" she exclaimed.
71      "Hello, Jannet.  May I come in to speak with you?"
72      "Why, yes.  Of course.  I'm here alone with just my father this evening.
73 Please, come in."
74      "Very well, just the people I had wanted to see.  I may need his help."
75 Kosta nudged his way into the livingroom and began to look for Mr. Fields.

90 as  "kml.)", and she says "Thank you for the kind words of encouragement." 
91 She will be sending me a package in the mail from Hood River that will contain
92 some more of her work.  So don't be suprised...     I hope you are able to see

99 Grann's progress in the Arts was swift.  After a few weeks training, he no
100 longer stumbled on the words, but allowed them to flow out of him in a smooth
101 continuous stream as he cast an enchantment or dweomer.
102 "Fine, Grann, fine," Milchar said.  "Soon you'll be up to cantrips."
103 Grann smiled faintly.  He'd worked very hard these last few days on a
104 particularly tricky spell- a minor transportal.
105 "Well, time for another lecture, I think.  As you know by now, I specialize
106 in the transport and communication fields.  I can do other things, but not
107 with nearly as much skill.  I was always facinated with transportation in
108 particular, ever since I wanted to travel the world as a child.  Since then,
109 I've travelled a great deal farther than about one world, and it all started
110 when I learned this ritual."
111 His preamble finished, Milchar carefully enunciated each syllable to Grann,
112 separating them with enough pause to make their power useless.  Repetition
113 enabled Grann to learn it; he'd always had a knack for sounds.  Milchar then
114 began showing Grann the gestures necessary for the spell- slowly at first, then
115 with increasing speed until Grann knew the entirety of the spell.
116 "Well," Milchar said, "With your learning of the past days, and the actual
117 ritual itself within your knowledge, let us see if you can cast it."
118 "I...shall try, master," Grann said.
119 "Is there not a saying among gnomes, that there is no try?  Only do?"
120 Grann nodded slightly, and repeated, "Do".
121 Pointing to a garden to the left of his tower, Milchar said, "Go there."
122 Grann nodded, then began.  The tones of his recital were light, as if the sun
123 illuminated the sound itself, somehow.  The gestures he made took on a second,
124 then a third meaning- and then, Grann vanished.
125 Instantly, Grann appeared over the garden.  With a loud "Ummph!", he fell the
126 last three feet to the ground.  A bit sheepishly, he returned to Milchar.
127 "Fine, Grann, fine.  Transporting above ground is infinitely better than
128 transporting below ground.  Usually, though, mages transport about half an
129 inch above the ground to make sure their feet aren't stuck in it."
130 Grann, upon hearing this, felt much better.  He smiled brightly.
131 "You do, however," Milchar began (and Grann stopped smiling), "need to work
132 on it some more.  Try again."
133 Grann muttered to himself, then cast again.  A loud "pop" was heard, but the
134 spell was not miscast- Grann again landed in the garden, with only six inches
135 to drop from this time.
136 "Try again, only transport to the walk.  By the bye, did you hear a pop?
137 I felt certain I heard a pop."

140     It wasent until person had ben watching the elf eat for sometime that a
141 realization of something unexpected dawned.  Glancing at the figure of the 
142 Gaurdian, person realized that the back of his chair was showing through his
143 rapidly fading form.  Quickly drawing the elvin dreamshaper's attention, person
144 pointed to what was taking place.

146 .  Wareever he's gone, he's beyond my talents now'.
147     'I wish he'd let us fallow', person replied.
148     'Perhaps' spoke the elf 'that is for the best'.
149     Just then the three felt, rather than heard, an odd poping sensation.
150     'I wonder what, if anything, that portends', were person'S words.

153 Here we are, two mono-chrome insomniacs, amused by what there is to see in the
154 wee hours of the morn. Eating peanut butter straight from the jars with our
155 respective spoons, we can not help but laugh at each others pale jokes. In 
156 a couple of hours, and maybe after a few hours of sleep, it might not be so 
157 funny, but we thought so at the time. <your turn>
158 Sure, thanks, shove a terminal at me when I have no idea what is going on.
159 A wee bit of advice, do not EVER drink the punch at a college party attende
160 d by organic chemistry students. I made such a mistake, then walked 70 or so
161 blocks and found myself here. only 260 blocks to go...you talk, my fingers
162 are still numb from the punch.-->
163 Or/Chem students, eh?  I was warned about that sort of thing my first year in
164 Chem 104...  Yes, the peanutbutter *is* spectacularly bad.  But I enjoy it.
165 Picture a vision of a manic depressive: teeth clenched, mouth held open in a
166 contorted mess.  Writer's block, I love it.  Enough gibberish for one sitting?
167 if not, get a bottle of that stuff- it might have marketing possibilities.
168 <Need I even ask if it is now my chance to releave control of the kbd?>
169 thats enough, lets call it quits, lets call it anything we want to. hum, lets
170 end with one of my favorite quotes...

174   The piper's hands passed over a silk-wrapped package, about the size and
175 shape of a library-sized book.  As his palms went over the package, it 
176 faded from view and the piper found himself staring across the table at a
177 venerable oriental gentleman.  The piper's eyes widened as the stranger
178 pressed both palms together and bowed.
179   "Return.  Success.  Going out and coming in without error.
180 Friends come without blame.  To and fro goes the way.
181 On the seventh day comes return.  It furthers one to have somewhere to go."
182 The stranger pressed his palms together and bowed again, then faded from
183 sight as the silk-wrapped package reappeared.
184   The piper's hands passed next over a curious contrivance that seemed to
185 be two jewels set in gold bezels, connected by a thick gold chain.  As
186 the pipers hands passed over them first one, then the other, lit from
187 within and sent a deep THRUMMM into the crowded room.  First the red,
188 the color staining the very air, making the table seem to run with blood.
189   URIMMMM
190 Then the green, filling the air with the color and feel of corruption.
191   THURIMMM
192 
193   The piper recoiled in revulsion.  The dark-robed one chuckled in a dry
194 whisper and asked:
195   "You don't like my little pretties?  We shall em
196 ch/em/eliminate these, then."  The figure swept the linked jewels into an
197 embroidered apron and removed them from the table.

201      Strange things had happened.  A new friend had changed into a completely
202 altered being.  Once known to his family, he was now almost unidentifiable.  
203 Could it be that he had met the one that had brought us together?  The dark
204 one thought of it, and was certain of it.  For some deranged reason the one
205 that had been the nexus had this strange charismatic feature that drew others
206 to him, allowed them to be altered, and did so.  What was not known was that 
207 the paler one also had an influence on this new person.  Or was it all so simply
208 the fact that the new one had permitted it all to just happen to him?  All 
209 things had to be considered.
210                              Just a passing thought.

217 
218   the former looked precisely where he was going to sit. bending over a bit, he
219 could tell there were quite a few twigs, and too many insects. so he stood by
220 the tree, and silently grumbled and groaned about having to do it.

221     "if you are ready, we will talk," whispered the one with the red sash.
222     "if you are not ready, then please reconsider our price," whispered the one
223 with the blue slash. insistently, and with an older creaking in the voice.
224 
225     "blast you, all of you," damned the aged companion. silence returned, and
226 the aged companion fell back against the tree. his face flushed with agony.
227 
228     "my fellows, tell us where his daughter is, and we will pay your price,"
229 admitted the former, who worried about the aged companion, but could not take
230 the liberty of helping.
231 
232     "our price is petty, compared to the life of your only daughter," the one
233 with the blue sash, whispered at the old man. his whispers shredded his ill
234 composure, and the old man fell again, to the roots of the tree. the former
235 scursed him and kneeled quickly to the old man's side.
236 
237     the one with the red sash also tried to kneel but was pierced in the chest
238 with a series of long claws. the one with the red slash fell to the ground. his
239 knees supported him, and the fall kept him upright, but he would not presume to
240 get that close again.
241 
242     the former looked into the eyes of the ancient man, and told the other men
243 they could have what they wanted. if only they would tell him where his only
244 daughter might be found. the scorn in his voice did the bargaining and the one
245 with the red sash whispered the name of an inn. then the one with the red sash
246 rose to his feet, and looked at his hand in order to see the wound.
247 
248     the other clothes on the man all wore the same stain of red, the same stain
249 as his sash. the claws had dug deeply, in a vengeant defense.
250 
251     the one with the red slash cursed himself, and signaled to run. the other
252 thieves leaped and ran away, dodging through the forest as if they had made it.
253 
254     the one with the red sash, stayed behind for the moent. and as he turned,
255 he dared to slowly and quietly mention the payment of the money. the former
256 only stared into the eyes of the old man, and whispered to him. the thief stood
257 quite alone for another moment, and then slid under a fallen trunk, through a
258 bramble and was out of sight.
259 
260     the former asked "are you still awake, do you still hear?" and waited.
261     after a moment, the ancient man lifted his head. the frail neck of the man
262 looked as if it might snap anytime.
263     the ancient man spoke "still Breathing and still Thinking, are you?"
264     the former nervously laughed for a moment, then resumed to stare. he began
265 to say something, but the old man interrupted quickly, and cleared his throat.
266     "find my daughter, and protect her from whatever took her. if it is the
267 dead that you find, then i release you your binds. you may do whatever you may
268 want, please find her though."
269  
270     "i will find her, we will find her, my friend, stay awake, aid me," the
271 former rose his tone and it seemed so much like a question.
272     "i will aid you, but first, i think i am going to die, soon now,"
273 
274     "blast, will you not try to stay awake, please stay awake my friend,"
275     "i will aid you, and we will play chess again, and mind you, i know how
276 good you really are, we will play again, although i now sleep," the old man was
277 now asleep and the former laid his head on the twigs and insects.
278 
279     the former lifted his hands and slipped the under the robes, in the fashion
280 of the knowledgible and the ancient.
281 
282     and so the former stepped away, and after the sound of him stepping faded
283 away, the robes and body of theis truly ancient man, simply dissapeared.

288    The Dragon looked at Rhian proudly,  happy at the man's fear. May have been
289 here for hundreds of years, it told     itself, but we can still cut a rather
290 imposing figure.
291    " Can you see us now, thief?" The    beast rumbled, it's ugly head reared up
292 high enough for a really good, conde-   cending look.
293    Rhian nodded dully. He got himself   into some of the weirdest things...
294    "Good.  Now, we must arrange your    trial."
295    "I didn't come here to thieve..er,   Lord Dragon?"
296    The Dragon drew itself up to an      impressive height. 
297    "We are Starfire Dracon Aesthian Rex"   "Starfire..Dracon..Aesthia..."Rhian
298 began, only to be stopped by a low growland an abrupt wave of the Beast's paw.
299    "No, No, NO! You murder the vowels!" A steady stream of black smoke trickled
300 from it's nostrils. "If you haven't the intelligence for a simple phrase.." 
301    The Drposure. It had forgotten haggravating these things could be.
302    " You may call me Dragon, Dolt."
303    Rhian felt an overwhaelming urge to call it more than that, but he held in 
304 mind his personal saftey. "It is a 
305 very, very nice name, Dragon. I could   never do it justice with the voice of 
306 a human."
307    The Dragon looked duly pleased.      But suddenly it's ugly face twisted.
308    "It seems that you have been trying  to lead us from the subject of the most
309 importance.. Your trial and execution."
310 "No...Really.. I am a wanderer.."    Rhian's voice took a shade of panic at 
311 the mentioning of death, and his hands  began to long for the grip of a sword.
312    "From what part of the world do you  come." The Dragon shot the question at 
313 him with stinging rapidity.
314    "The south.."Rhian started..            "Lies!" The dragon interupted 
315 fiercely. "County!"                        "Daton.."
316    "Fabrications of the highest order.  Village?"                          
317    "Devonham.." Rhian's face grew moist with a clammy sweat, and his heart 
318 raced with the speed of a frightened    rabbit.
319    The Dragon sensed this, and a cruel  smile played on it's lips.
320    "We are not at all convinced." It said slowly, staring at the shaking human.
321    Rhian tried his best to remain still,but his nervousness could not
322 contained. Dammit.. The Thing was just sitting there, staring..After what 
323 seemed an eternety, the Dragon spo.
324   "We remember the South.."it said      softly, toying with some treasure. 
325 "It is still the same?"
326   "Oh, yes." Rhian welcomed the safe    subject.
327   "The sunrises come late, ripening intohot summer days.. The warm winters
328 the warm and golden sun, arid plains.." The dragon sighed dreamily at it's     
329 remenices, It's mouth twisting in a     grotesque mockery of a smile.Rhian's   
330 attention riveted immediatly on it's    massive front camnines, each large enoug
331 for the creature to wear a golden diademon it as ornamentation.
332    "And the fields are lush, and green  wand great fat flocks of sheep graze  
333 with horses, and cows.. everything teemswith life.. and growth..and Game.."The
334 dragon growled happily "Ah, the game..  Burghers, Mayors, Town officials, Maidens.."
335    Rhian's senses sprung back to alert, hearing the Dragon rattle off that last 
336 list..
337    "And so, we live here."The touch of  danger returned to the Animal's voice. 
338 "In a Hell forsaken wilderness, no game but for the tiny, scrawny deer that 
339 don't happen to die from the damn COLD!
340 The dragon slammed it's fist into the   treasure, flattening several works of  
341 irreplaceable art. "And, Oh Diablo, the COLD! It's unbearable!"
342    "Then why don't you leave?" Rhian    said carefully, surprised by the sudden
343 force with which anger gripped this     thing.
344    "Ehtain Rhiatinbok, Of course!" the  Dragon thundered, annoyed by the 
345 obvious stupidity of the question.         "The wizard?"
346    "Yes, the Damnable wizard, no doubt  know to you only for the persecution of
347 Dragons." An uncomfortable silence ensued. "Does he still live?"
348    Rhian shrugged. "I much doubt that.. All the stories I heard were hundreds 
349 of years old, at least."
350    "He's the Main reason We..Retreated  to this place. To escape his wrath.."
351 it resumed blowing smoke into air already thick with the stuff. "ONly human we 
352 ever respected, though.. Were spelled tostay here until some smart,enterprising
353 young human decides to save his own neckand free me. Of his own descision, of
354 course."
355   Rh suddenly realized what had been going on. The dragon was not going to 
356 kill him, unless he refused to help. He had been had.
357    The dragon nearly read his mind.     "Now, Human, don't get the idea that I
358 hesitate to kill you if you refuse..My  last human meal was got that way."
359    Rhian swallowed hard.
360    "And if I don't decide to help you?"
361    The Dragon was cruelly silent as,    with one swipe of it's massive paw,

368 	The Ballad of Apollo XIII (words: William Warren,
369 		music: "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" by Gordon Lightfoot)
370 	Ther's legends galore in the pulp SF lore
371 	'Bout shipwrecks of spacers a-spacin',
372 	When meteor holes come 'tween men and their goals
373 	By demolishing ships that they're racin'.
374 Painting pictures with words like none you've ever heard,
375 SF writers made frightening predictions.
376 But the terrors txey tell cannot equal the hell
377 Faced by three men in fact, and not fiction.
378 	To April 11, 1970, now,
379 	We must let our narrative carry us.
380 	Three men in a C-S-M named Odyssey;
381 	Beneath them, the LM named Aquarius.
382 With a furious roar, Saturn leapt for the sky
383 With Jack Swiggart, Fred Haise, and Jim Lovell,
384 Toward a planned rendezvous that would never come true
385 With the gray lunar gravel and rubble.
386 	Still, they set up housekeeping in orbit 'round Earth,
387 	Then translunar insertion was kindled,
388 	But the public just yawned, for their landing was third,
389 	And behind them old Terra slow dwindled.
390 Apollo XIII travelled on down the track
391 Laid down by the three laws of Newton.
392 At fifty-six hours into lunar bound coast,
393 Lovell said, "Houston, we have a problem."
394 	Now they may have been struck by a meteorite.
395 	Maybe something had just overloaded.
396 	But their panels went red with their malfunction lights
397 	And in Odyssey something exploded.
398 That blast blocked or ruptured their fuel cell lines;
399 Their electrical energy faltered.
400 With no hope at all of a rescue in time
401 Thirteen's mission profile had altered.
402 	To physics and God they commended their lives,
403 	For no power on earth could have saved 'em.
404 	Although NASA let the men talk with their wives,
405 	Of goodbyes there was never a mention.
406 Three men in a C-S-M bound for the Moon
407 Reached two hundred and six thousand miles.
408 Did they have enough air to get all the way there?
409 Could they trust what they read on their dials?
410 	And when they reached Luna, could they change course for home?
411 	Would she trap them, or loose them at random?
412 	Untested advice and contigency plans
413 	Were the only things NASA could hand 'em.
414 When Apollo XIII crossed the limb of the Moon
415 And death came from the receivers
416 We knew the next signal would speak of their doom
417 Or answer the faith of believers.
418 	"Apollo Thirteen, this is Houston. Do you read?"
419 	Dear God, let them answer us quickly.
420 	The world held it's breath, and in Mission Control
421 	Every screen lit a face pale and sickly.
422 "Apollo Thirteen, this is Houston. Do you read?"                           
423                                                                            
424 That empty sound stretched on for years.
425 "Houston... This is Thirteen... We're coming home!" said a voice,
426 And the world found relief in its tears.
427 
428 
429 At T plus one hundred and thirty-eight hours
430 They jettisoned Odyssey's wreckage.
431 That module was shattered and blasted apart --
432 A symbol of death in the space age.
433 	Aquarius served as their lifeboat to shore,
434 	Til they knew they would no longer need her.
435 	At T plus one hundred and forty-one hours,
436 	With a deep prayer of "Thank you!" they freed her.
437 Ed, Roger, and Gus must have smiled on those days,
438 Knowing theirs was the path tnot to follow.
439 But their souls were with Swiggart and Lovell and Haise
440 Riding home on the thirteenth Apollo.
441 	At T plus one hundred forty-three, fifty-four
442 	Apollo XIII hit the waters.
443 	Three men returned home, shaken up, but alive,
444 	To txheir wives and their sons and their daughters!
445 Ther's legends galore in the pulp SF lore,
446 But all of them now do cause men to reflect
447 On three days when the world's hearts went racing.
448 	Painting pictures with words all too few people heard,
449 	SF writers could make their predictions,
450 	But always recall that, in spite of them all,
451 	The truth was much greater than fiction.
452 
453 	Yes, always recall that, in spite of them all,
454 	The truth w must be greater than fiction.

471      'Must be immagining things' person spoke.  Shure a good bunch of stories
472 around here being told.  Is it always like this?
473      'Well it comes and goes' was Dreamtoucher's reply.  It sorta dries up in an
474 election year, whatever that is.  You hear some of the most off the wall assum-
475 ptions and quasi-logick arguments then.  No, this has to be just about the best
476 I've ever seen it.  I can rember a time when a bunch of us were wondering to-
477 gather accross alternate tau's in a gray mechine called shadow.  Thats how I 
478 ended up here in the first place.
479     I'm not sure how it happened, dreamtoucher went on, but there's a spot by 
480 the roman bath ware some kind of pequilarity of time happened to me.  A few 
481 minuets of my time ago you werent here yet and NET was only using its level-2
482 code.  Thair was someone named Themnax running around here.  He was another non-
483 human like you and me.  He had 16 fingers and green skin.
484      Oh and I did feal that poping sensation, a bit unpleasent, the way a glass
485 of beer must feel when it is being drunk.  Now that reminds me of something else
486 , you didnt happen to bring a towel with you by any chance?  And whose that over
487 there with the hammer?  He wouldnt happen to be half elf and half troll would
488 he?  Sorta reminds me of somebody like that, nuttier than a tree but one heck
489 of a metalformer.  But no, the resemblance is more appearent than real.  There
490 IS a strong feel of magic about him though, I wonder why?

493   As rapidly as they had appeared, the various instruments of divination 
494 disappeared within the dark robe across the table fron the piper.  Watching
495 the flicker of those thin hands caught and held the piper's attention like the
496 moving head of a snake can mersmerize its prey.
497   "I think," came the labored whisper, "that we should use either the Tarot or
498 the I Ching."
499   The piper made a mental effort to recapture his wandering attention.
500   "What?"
501   "The Tarot or the I Ching."  The dry whisper rustled.  "To use as the primary
502 augury to fortell your future."
503   "Yes, of course."  The piper replied.  "I am not expert in those matters."
504   The figure's chuckle was small but perceptible.  "Let us go for the cards,
505 then,"  came the whisper.  "The lesson book of the illiterate."
506   Feeling slightly insulted, the piper held his silence as the dark figure
507 brought forth the deck of cards.

The city this time of year is at its best.  The air is still fresh
523 from winter's cold clensing, the streets are clear, and even the people
524 treat the world around them with a fresh sense of renewal.  Walking through
525 downtown, admiring the compact organization of the city's blocks, I'm once
526 again astonished at the delightful combination of small town and urban
527 metropolis that this city exibits.

528      And this city has so much more to offer than the casual observer might
529 think at first glance.  A distinctly urban area, small but complete;
530 surrounding bedroom communities, also small but with industries of their
531 own; and land verging upon wilderness within thirty minutes drive of the
532 city's core!  Even though I've lived here for almost four years now, I still
533 find myself surprised and invigorated at new discoveries, and I still
534 marvel at the way the long-time inhabitants of this land have been able to
535 make peace between the conflicting needs of technological progress and
536 natural balance.  And of course, it is only here in this land that I can
537 cross the threshold into Inisfal.  To me this is perhaps the most important
538 thing I've found.  Yes, I think, to me it is almost certainly the most
539 important.

540      Indulging myself, I wander throughout downtown glancing in windows and
541 wishing, watching people and wondering, and absorbing the sunshine.  But I
542 soon realize that it is late, the light of the setting sun is reflecting on
543 the upper windows of the taller buildings, and my stomach begins to sing a
544 chorus of hosannahs for deliverance from a less than spiritual hunger.  I
545 suppose that I should begin the trek home, so I start off in the direction
546 of one of the less pleasant areas of downtown: the so-called Transit Mall.

547      I have only a few more blocks to go when a car pulls quickly to the
548 curb just in front of me.  The back door opens, and a distinguished looking
549 gentleman steps smartly onto the sidewalk and faces me.  He's a very good
550 looking man and he has a distinct bearing of authority, the look of a
551 retired military officer,  someone used to giving orders that are quickly
552 obeyed.  Looking him over I think to myself, "Boxer shorts; children in a
553 military school; his wife has never seen him naked", and attempt to walk
554 past.  I'm stopped forcefully by his hand on my arm, and I'm levitated off
555 the ground and into the back seat of the car.  The door slams shut and the
556 car accelerates swiftly away from the curb.

563 Bard: Thanks for your entry...it's nice to know that someone these days still
564 cares about the Apollo program!  It often depresses me to see how rarely the
565 anniversaries of crucial steps in humankind's greatest advance are remembered.
566 Is it because people fail to recognize how significant expansion into space
567 really is--or do they now consider space travel too common to be exciting?

571 The tankard was almost finished and THOR was thinking to himself of his trip
572 home from the INN. But before he could pull himself to his feet, a group of
573 three approached his table. They were dressed in fine clothes and each was armed
574 with a blade or saber. It was obvious that they had all been drinking heavily
575 this night and their attention seemed to be focused on the hammer that was in
576 its tether on THOR's belt.
577 "Oh-ho!!! What have we here my fine comrades? Perhaps an old dinosaur who still
578 remembers when the hills were but large mole hills?" Their laughter was overly
579 loud and the ale had released their inhibitions and obviously their good sense.
580 "Theold dog probably can't handle a blade1" spoke the smallest of the three and
581 also the loudest. THOR looked beyond the troubleson trio for the shortest and
582 quickest route to the door of the INN but the mercenaries had spread out now
583 making a half circle towords his table. There was no way he could leave without having to pass one of the three men.
584 THOR kept his eyes fixed upon the oak table in front of him and pretended not to
585 hear the mockings that were being made of him and his weapon.
586 "See Ramas, he is so old his hearing has left him?"
587 "Most likely it gave up and went off to Valhala to wait for the rest of the old
588 badger." Spoke the largest and most jeering of the three. Still THOR did not 
589 raise his head nor his eyes from the top of the table. He did not want to
590 bring more antagonizing ridicule by causing a face off between himself and these
591 three fighters. THOR could tell from their weapons that they were obviously 
592 three mercenaries who had become bored between assignments and were looking for
593 a reason to use their weapons since the times had been slow in their need.
594 "I think he is asleep RAMAS, perhaps too much grog, what do you think?"
595 With that statement the larger mercenary drew his saber and placed the point of
596 the glistening weapon directly in front of THOR's face, a mere half an inch from
597 his nose. "Is my friend correct old man, did the grog put you in this stupor or
598 is it that you are afraid to look me in the eye, man to man?"
599 Before an answer could be given and before the mercenary could bring his saber
600 away from THOR's face, the terrible hammer came thundering down upon the back of
601 the mercenaries hand forcing the bones of the hand to become one with the handle
602 of his saber. The sabers handle could be seen from the top of the injured mans
603 hand by the other two mercenaries and as they vainly attempted to reach for their own weapons the hammer found its mark
604 again. Only it was not the hands of the other two that were destroyed.
605 No....it was their eternal soul that was sent from the INN as the hammer slammed
606 one fighters brains to his neck and the others head from its shoulders.
607 THOR turned his attention back to the first mercenary who had pried apart the
608 remains of his hand from the sabers handle
609 and said in a slow and precise voice,
610 "Beware of old dinosaurs....for they can sometimes crush you to death!"

620   You are safe tonight my pretties, for I am a captive.
621   The cars are circling my hiding place, I see their
622   spot lights searching for me, a light catches my tail;
623   I hear the crackle of two way radio's. More men come
624   with firesticks to try and aprehend me. Little do they
625   know of my terrible power. I close my eyes and concentrate
626   I feel my body begin to change, it's working quite well.
627   By the time the men reach me they find a young man who
