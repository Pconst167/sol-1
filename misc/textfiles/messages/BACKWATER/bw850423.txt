20 SIGH, I got home last night to find a note from the phone repairman saying
21 that it ain't their trouble, sigh.. I guess I should have known better then
22 to expect anything better from them. So yet another wonderful aspect as a 
23 result of the break up... finger pointing. So, I guess we'll just have to
24 live with the problem until it gets bad enough that even a monkey would
25 recognize that there is something wrong. Just what I need, a long drawn out
26 battle with the phone company. What we need here is compitition. At least that
27 way I could tell em where to stick there noisy lines. Instead I'm stuck with
28 "It's your problem, our lines check out fine." Sigh.....

31 MIKEY OR ANYONE ELSE..
32   I have just been tuning in on this board for a week.  And now would like
33 to start to write some stuff, since college is getting out next week. May 3
34 Is there anything I should know such as entering long text. 
35 Any helpful hints will be greatly appreciated.
36                           Thanks.
37                                   Odie.

45 Odie: one good thing to remember is to *ignore* twits such as the above...
46 On the techical side, one thing you should know is that you should delay the
47 sending of new line of text by two seconds in order to allow the drive to
48 catch up...  Hope this is of some help.

51   Still no one spoke, the silence hanging thicker than the layers of smoke now
52 waifing through the wall.  The fourth man stood motionless for a moment, he 
53 hand on the wall switch.  Then he walked to the window.  Rather than adjusting
54 the blinds, he placed a finger on one of the thin metal strips, and with a 
55 sharp pop that seemed to echo in the tiny room, he pulled it down to peer into
56 the night.
57   "It's raining." He said.
58   "I've been section chief four days now.  Do you know it's rained every day
59 so far?" He turned back to the table, the blinds snaping back into place.
60   None of the other three faces even nodded.  They did not know this man, and
61 whatever muse was upon him, they dare not disturb it.

64   Elax began to feel the current around him.  It was current he was sure now.
65 Slowly he began to move in the direction that felt the shallowest.  It still
66 disturded him that he could see no land in any direction, even more now that
67 he stood on the bottom just a few feet below the surface of the water.  Some-
68 thing was certainly wrong here.  He still could see nothing of the surface that
69 he walked on, for all his eyes told him, he was still in deep waters.

72      "Doctor, I do believe you love a mystery, don't you?"  Sigmund said.
73      Doctor Frankenstupe looked up from a stack of computer printouts,
74 "But of course.  I'm fascinated by the ersatz kathyd.  I wonder who it
75 could be.  Have you formed a psychological profile, Sigmund?"
76      Sigmund chuckled, "Not really.  You occupy most of my time.  What have
77 you deduced?"
78      "I assume the ersatz kathyd, the Satyrist, and Romeo are all one 
79 person."
80      "That seems relatively obvious.  Anything else?"
81      "Well, he's not your garden-variety juvenile twit.  The command of
82 the English language and his spontaneous creativity makes me think that he
83 is literate and mature... in age at least.  He knows his way around the
84 system.  I would guess that he's a regular or semi-regular patron.  
85 Probably someone that we know well in another personna."  Frankenstupe said
86      "Doctor, you spend alot of time delving into your own psyche... how 
87 about *your* psychological ideas about this Satyrist?"
88      "Hmmm... the Satyrist label holds two meanings for me:  One is a 
89 person who uses satire to spoof others and the other is a strongly sexed
90 male.  He seems to focus on women, so he possible may dislike women and
91 vents his frustration in this manner."
92       Sigmund puffed on his pipe, then said, "Or the Satyrist may be a 
93 woman."
94       "What?"  Frankenstupe looked shocked.
95       "Not an orginal idea really.  The real kathyd was on that track.
96 Of course, I could be completely wrong, but can you think of a better 
97 disguise?  Psychology can often mislead us into conjuring up motives that
98 really don't apply.  Remember Frank, the child molester?"
99      "Hmmm... I see your point.  Do you have any suspects?"
100      "One or two, but I'll have to wait for more evidence before I commit
101 myself."  Sigmund said.  Frankenstupe nodded and returned to his printouts,
102 intent on his task.
103                                            Doctor Frankenstupe

126      It was very quiet here, deep within the top-security data exchange
127 maintained by UNDERGROUND.  With only an almost imperceptible hum to break
128 the silence, an observer might mistake this complex for a tomb- were it not
129 for the myriad of tiny indicators blinking briefly, telling the surrounding

131      Only a small display terminal broke the endless bank of lights in this

133 appears to be typing something, answering the questions of the little god

196    The young lad known as the Walrus sheepishly re-entered the tavern.  It
197 had been such a long time since his last visit.  He remembered back to the
198 those days of mixed feelings.  Although the tavern had no official age li-
199 mit, it was there nevertheless.  Not exactly by age, but by wisdom and ma-
200 turity.  He had matured some, but still felt out of place.  When he  first
201 frequented the pub, he listened to the tale, then struck out with some
202 stories of his own.  They didn't go over quite as well as he expected, in
203 fact, they were often ignored.  He felt rejected at the time, and didn't
204 visit the tavern again for quite a while.  During that time he realized
205 that he could only be accepted in the pub through time, and this time he
206 was willing to take that time.  But he still realized that the only way to
207 eventually have tales that equalled the patrons was tell some, and improve
208 them as he went along.  He confidently stepped to a table and patiently
209 waited for someone with a vacant ear.  "But this time it'll be different!"
210 he thought, somewhat brashly, "This time I'll do it right."

217      ExLax felt the current tugging at his ankles.  Strangely, the current
218 seemed to be getting stronger.  Splash!  A long, brown, log-like object fell
219 into the water alongside him.  Whatever the object was, the stench was enough
220 to make ExLax grab for his nose.  Moving away from it, he continued to search
221 for a way out.  A high , white wall suddenly came into view, and he walked
222 toward it.  The wall was smooth as porcelain, and there were regularly-spaced
223 holes in it high above his head.  A soft noise behind him, and he spun to see
224 a large sheet of fabric fall into the water.  Another fell, then another.  He
225 moved back the way he had come, thinking of the uses he could put the fabric
226 to.  He touched the fabric--it was as rough as the bark of a tree.  
227      Thunder boomed overhead, and ExLax was knocked off his feet by a sudden
228 gust of wind.  "A foul wind"," he muttered to himself as he struggled to his
229 feet.  There was a sudden sucking sound, as if a hole had suddenly opened and
230 light streamed into his prison.  He caught a brief glimpse of a white sun 
231 overhead, but was suddenly pushed underwater by an object hitting him in the
232 back.  He quickly surfaced, oto see only the stinking, log-like object again.
233 "It must have circled around, to hit me again," he deduced.  "If that's so, 
234 then this must be...."  A metallic noise far overhead echoed in his prison,
235 and powerful streams of water suddenly jetted from the holes in the walls, 
236 knocking him from his feet once again.  A powerful under-current sucked at
237 his ankles, but he forced his way to the surface once again.  "The current's
238 too strong!" he screamed, fighting against it with all of his strength.  
239 "I'm not going to make it out of here!  Oh, shit!" were his last thoughts as
240 he was sucked under for the last time...

247 Elax came to on a hard surface, he touched it, rubed his sore hands accross
248 it.  Ceramics, had to be, was he brought here by someone, something, or was
249 he still in a dream of sorts?  He looked around him, strange geometrical
250 shapes were all around.  He aproached the closest one, touched it...  "Damn",
251 it was unbearably hot to his skin.  The material seemed to be the same as the
252 surface he was on.  Very hard, very smooth, slightly porous, different color
253 though.  Everything around him seemed to be of different colors, but all or
254 it the same material.  He examined other objects, not all were hot, some were
255 cold, so cold his skin stuck to them.  All his senses were fully awake by now,
256 something in the atmosphere was making everything clear and crisp.  He took a
257 sighting on the source of the intense light that was above him in hopes that it
258 would move in some sort of regular patern like the sun did and headed off to
259 try to see what he could find beyond this park of objects.

340      After gaining control of the horse, I leaned forward to try and catch
341 up with partner.  He was riding fast and hard, and I was so new at all of
342 this.  He suddenly slowed to a trot and I caught up with him, he raised
343 his hand to his mouth to warn me to be quiet. We had entered a vally with
344 high ledges on each side, a narrow trail beside a slow stream.  Plant life
345 seemed to be in healthier condition here, with small bushes and grasses
346 growing near the stream.  What was that?  A whistle? Yes, there it is again!
347 Partner seemed to be in intense concentration, he must have been listening
348 too. We moved slowly on.  The sun was starting to fall in the sky and the
349 bugs were moving in for a feast on me. Partner motioned to stop, he 
350 dismounted and helped me do the same.  Unloading the horses, he set up 
351 camp.  No fire was lit, biscuits and jerky for dinner. Partner gave me
352 his canteen to help wash the dry taste down. Partner also set up a bedroll
353 for me beside camp, he settled down near the horses.
354     Up intill this time, no words had passes partner's lips, I had wondered
355 if he was mute, but as I lay down on my roll, he pulled up a mouth organ
356 and began to play.  A sweet slow song that complimented the cool clear
357 night.  And then the words to the song came from those weather beaten
358 lips.  He sang of the prarie, and wind, of old cattle hands and .....
359 Sleep came quickly.
360    I awoke to a strange face, Ieee!! An Indian, and indian that even
361 looked like a indian, yeh painted face, less that acceptable attire
362 for the "mall" ect. He was standing of me with a big S*** eating
363 grin on his face. I sat up abruptly to see partner chatting with
364 two others.  "What the heck is goin on?" I demanded.
365    Partner raised his hand to quiet me and continued his conversation,
366 miffed, I got up and rolled up my bed. The Indian that had started
367 (err scared) me was looked at me with great amusement.  How strange
368 I must have looked to him.  (err looked/looking-above line)
369 What had I gotton my self into? Just to be sure, I patted my pocket.
370 Escape was still there.

373      The Cathode Plate; Episode 3...
374      Normaly a spy-eye would be sent down first, with everyone watching safely
375 from the bricge.  None was available.   Video linkage microbots was the next
376 suggestion, but there were none of these on board eather.
377      For better or worse ( the ships only masterbot wouldn't fit and probably
378 would not have made it if it could) Thenan drew the short straw.
379      He barrowed Nica's belt of xendu while his own psionic interface was con-
380 nected to the ship's main computer.  Effectivly this meant that as long as he
381 remembered to 'send', the Jeluni's crew could watch on the main view screen 
382 whatever Thenan saw with his own eyes.  They would also hear, through a \
383 simmiliar arraingement, whatever his ears picked up.
384      Safty line about his waste, Lejab at the top of the hole, Thenan decended.
385  The line tied about his waste did not end there but rather dangled, weight 
386 tied to it's free end, another eight meters.  This crude precaution, it was 
387 hoped, would set off any suprises the shaft might hold before he, personaly, 
388 was in the way.
389      The decent, though long, was made without incident.  The room at the 
390 bottem was unlighted.  This came as no suprise.  He waited patiantly as his 
391 special multipurpose staff, the one he had spent several pleasent summers at 
392 local craftufacturing centers perfecting, was lowered to him.
393      The space he was in, now that he had light to see it,was of modest size,
394 smaller than the Jeluni's bridge deck.  Cobwebs were everyware and the crude 
395 stone walls were couvered with a thick layer of dust.  From here passages 
396 radiated like the spokes of some great wheel.  Fallowing one picked at random
397 , he was led to what appeared to be a sort of catticoomb.  Along both walls 
398 were upright, clear-faced,'sarcophigi, the dead standing an attention.
399      The passage ended in another transverse to it, curving back in both 
400 directions.  Further exploration revealed this to be the 'rim' of the 'wheel'
401 at whose 'hub' he had entered.  Each 'spoke' was identical to the first.  
402 Thats all there was, another 'dead end'.
403      As Thenan started back for the last time, he dissappeared.  That is, he 
404 found himself in another chamber, in no way that he could tell, connected with
405 ware he had just been.  
406      At the same time, on the bridge of the Jeluni, the main viewing screen 
407 went blank.
408      (yes there WILL be an episode 4 and 5 and 6 unless I combine two of those
409 into one or pad one out into two, et.c )

413   The piper looked up to see a young face that he recognized coming in.  The
414 young man took a seat with the other newcomers; the piper saw several, most
415 with nervous faces.  Taking a respite from his ongoing tale, the piper strolled
416 over to the newcomers table and sat down for a few moments.
417   "Welcome," he said.  "I really should apologize to you all for the rather 
418 cold welcome, or lack of it, that we "regulars" at the inn often give to
419 newcomers, but an apology carries with it a presumption that something may
420 change.  Walrus -- welcome back, I probably would not have stopped by had
421 I not reconginized you.  Those of us who seem to spend a lot of time here
422 generally tend to be rather involved in our present creations and pay less
423 attention to others than those others would usually like.  It's natural,
424 really -- the activity is pretty engrossing -- but frustrated until you
425 become accepted.  (ch frustrated/frustrating -- I can TOO keep track of tense)
426 Another reason that newcomers don't collect many comments is that many of
427 the 'regulars' wear many faces -- are you completely new folks or simply
428 new personas of those we already know?  (Yes, I tried a few new personas
429 but couldn't afford the time investment to keep them going.)  What I am
430 leading up to, is that you will be accepted on a casual basis -- there could
431 be no mistaking a rejection!  Please don't ask for criticism unless you
432 really want it -- you may get some anyway, after a short time.  We're not
433 an unfreindly bunch here, we just tend to not spend a lot of time nurturing
434 new folks along.  It'll take several weeks of work for us to feel that
435 you've become "permanent".  By then we'll know you pretty well and probably
436 consider you one of the 'regulars' too.  Right now the only multi-author
437 stuff going on is with the NET et al.  The rest of us seem to be off spinning
438 individual tales.  Perhaps another multi-author, non spy, story will arise
439 in the future (I enjoy the NET, I just don't want to participate).  In
440 the meantime," the piper called over the innkeeper, "could you put a round
441 for these new folks on my tab?"
442 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
443 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (notes, not of the story...)
444      I will be the first to admit that I did get a bit carried away at the 
445 bottom of the disk, two disks ago, but what I said HAD to be said.  I have
446 used many a name myself, and have been misunderstood in most all of them.
447 This is why I may be tempted to enter an entire stack of boarders, as did
448 Capt'n Barefoot, and say simply: "C'est Moi... Ciao...  <"  <click>
449 
450 I won't say that I am angry by the appearance of a few people around here,
451 for I am not.  I just wish they would clarify, validate, their statements.
452 
453 The Jiz:  The last time I heard your name mentioned, there were only two
454 BackWater people in the room- myself,
455 and one other, who shall remain nameless.  (No, not another one of my masks,
456 but a real flesh-and-bones person.)  When your name was mentioned, it was the
457 other person that commented on your works, not I.  And even then, I did not
458 call one a twit.  If you are readily available, and were at the last meet, I
459 do not recall your name being mentioned.  I could be mistaken.  Unless you
460 care to inform me as to your other personality (if you have one), I will be 
461 glad to hear it.  If not, I won't come looking for you, that's a job best left
462 to others that are more suited for the job.  <Right, MiG?>
463 Leave me a message somewhere if you wish, I frequent a majority of the 'high-
464 density' boards in the Portland area.
465  
466 -The-anti-smurf:  Foolish as it may sound, I take your statement as a direct
467 insult to the both of us.  PaPa Smurf and I are roommates.  The 'rambling', 
468 as you put it, is something he felt he had to say.  Sometimes it is best 
469 expressed when given to a crowd ofpeople that are unknown.  Some people 
470 understood what he had to say, you did not.
471 I know that there is an ample supply of people out there that hate smurf's just
472 because it used to be a fasionable thing to do.  Lord knows that I've had the
473 little stuffed toy doll I have sitting on a shelf battered, punched, mangled,
474 and thrown to the ground followed by laughter by the ones I call 'friends'. 
475 They don't know what that simple act of 'fasionable dislike' meant to me.
476 Not only was it a symbol of PaPa, or Herr Oeberschlumph as the German Air 
477 Caedts called him, but it was a gift to me, a present for my twenty-first 
478 birthday.  It was a gift from a person that meant just a little something to 
479 me at the time.  Noone understands these things anymore.
480  
481      The Young Master West WILL continue, although many of you wil l not like
482 txe direction it will take.  (By the way, Milchar, I know what you mean about
483 it being rather difficult to keep the two stories going...)
484 I think I'll just crawl under a rock now and try to get my stories written.

517 The Walrus graciously took the ale in hand and began to reply.  "It's quite

519 tavern.  I would probably act the same in a similar situation.  I think I
520 am ready to take the time and effort necessary to deserve comment.  That is

548      "Tony?", Peterson called to the lifeless form on the comfortable-looking
549 couch occupying a large portion of the office.  Arjusk awoke with a start.  His
550 usual half-hour nap at 1:00 would be postponed today.  Sleepily, he says,
551 "Yeah?  Whaddya want?"
552      "John sent in an assignment.  Care to guess what you're gonna do?"
553      Arjusk was in no mood for guessing games; he was usually very grumpy after
554 his naps.  "No.  Tell me."
555      "You and I are gonna knock over a bank in Frisco.  I guess Liz is gonna
556 tag along."
557      Arjusk snapped fully awake after hearing the news.  "A bank?  Which one?"
558      Peterson smiled.  "Never were one for small talk, were you?  Oh, well.
559 Big time, my boy, big time.  Federal Reserve #12."
560      #UNDERGROUND must be in some sort of trouble to try something like that,#
561 Arjusk thought.  "When?"
562      "We fly today, my boy.  Not first class, but you know how hard it is to
563 get even one extra penny for expenses.  I think R&D is getting a lot of money
564 nowadays- especially the AI department."
565      "Stuff ready yet?"
566      "Sure, just gotta get it at Supply.  Oh, here's Liz.  Hi, Gorgeous!"
567      Elizabeth ignored him with her usual manner of indifference towards his
568 comments.  "Let's go, guys!  Our plane leaves at two!"
569      At that, David and Tony walked with Elizabeth to Supply.  After collecting
570 their packs, they were transported to the nearby airport, bound for San Fran.
