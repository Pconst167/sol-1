 24 ?????????? Remaining relentlent in my pursuits of Unhappiness anywhere it
 25    my exist on this Planet or Elsewhere, I will continue with my triade ...
 26  
 27 Although the meeting may have been a coupla years ago, NOW, on the OTHER
 28 (north) end of this same wtreet, which remains unpaved ... they only paved 
 29 what Overlord Dave wanted them to ... a long, long story unto itself), we
 30 have a young couple that's just moved in across the travesty the City 
 31 placed in the yard who nothing about the "Clause" in THEIR sales contract
 32 until the day there were supposed to close which is, of course, AFTER 
 33 they'd already paid a huge non-refundable earnest money deposit and had
 34 done hours upon hours of fixup.  Since they are ALSO on a corner lot, even
 35 though you couldn't tell by looking because I've landscaped the right of
 36 way (Which I was told would be mine when "THEY" stole my property), these
 37 new neighbors could be in much the same position ...
 38  
 39 ... ESPECIALLY if ny OTHER Northerly neighbor decides to develop (OR for
 40 reasons I won't go into, has his property "seized" [another unbelievably
 41 DANGEROUS Bloomanhour Brainchild, isn't it???] and "given" to some Tri-
 42 County Favorite Son to develop) ...
 43  
 44 ... AND/OR another Very Exclusive development, which adjoins said 
 45 neighbor's undeveloped 3-acre lot decides it wants an "outlet" for its
 46 poorly planned thus congested development and thereby drains its Wash-
 47 inton Co. traffic problems onto us unsuspecting (and much poorer)
 48 Multnomah Co. residents WHO WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT, no less (this *HAS*
 49 happened before according to the Ash Creek NA).
 50  
 51 So EVEN THOUGH **I** have no "Clause," any way it comes down, I too would
 52 be outnumbered.
 53  
 54 And this **AFTER** "THEY"'d already STOLEN my front yard to drain said
 55 historic 43-house development to my  South ******PLUS**** an additional
 56 10'x150" easement ... through unbelievably shameful coercion of a 78-yo
 57 woman ... while **TWO** separate lawwyers (which WILL be named, but not
 58 now) for some reason(s) (which I WILL speculate on later) could find no
 59 way to "help."

144 RECYCLED thru the non-profit housing aggregates once again which will,
145 of course, keep the economy moving ...
146  
147 ... AND EVEN IF the proliferation of OTHER equally as ugly partisan plots
148 are "moving" enough, perhaps have our local legal legacies taunted on 
149 such national pageants as the 7:00 sleezecasts or their sensationalized
150 4:00 forerunners SHOULD provide some stimulus for "unloading" at whatever

153 ... keeping in mind that, like selling a house, you will have to grossly
154 overstate "your asking price" in order to arrive at a "fair" compromise

156  
157 Because whatever you think of Tom Metzger and his ilk, the tactics used
158 set a very dangerous precedent; to then "lose" this appeal papers is

257 #################### Maybe I CAN make a Federal Case of it ################
258  
259 Huh, **MAYBE** I'm in luck, what with the raging fray about sexual harass-
260 ment [expanded to include sex/age discrimination] and all.  Even though all
261 such charges had always seemed to have a history of MISuse against inten-
262 tionally targeted "undesirables" at PPS (or MISFITS if you will), to the
263 seemingly great peril of all now seriously "at risk" male teachers (and 
264 THANKS, I believe, maily to phony "intervention" by MY union), to say 
265 nothing of the rather secretive, in-house arraignment methods, I did hazard
266 to report some of my VALID claims in this regard, including my own personal
267 efforts AND outrageous outcomes of such effort ... which SHOULD become evi-
268 dent on even a cursory examination of my personnel file(s) and information
269 submitted to my union.  And although I'd listed any number of incidents of 
270 all such abuse in my extensive documentation submitted to the Board of 
271 Education, there ARE even more; some that can probably be very easily AND
272 *estensively* verified (such as the vile sexist/racist joke this same 
273 repeat and sustained [and previously indicted??] offender told me in the
274 presence of another secretary and some specialists, a phenomenon I discussed
275 with the secretary later).  But I've heard nary a word from the Board, even
276 though I submitted much the same information TWICE.
277  
278 I also DID seek legal assistance from a highly-endorsed local attorney 
279 (whose secretary, TTW, had coincidentally ALSO worked for the district
280 <grin> ... HONEST, she *HAD* {AND there were OTHER coincidences as well]), 
281 but his practice was limited strictly to workmen's comp issues and the
282 outcome of a stress claim would only have served to place me back into
283 the same monsterous, scandalous environment without REALLY addressing my
284 concerns.  I would then have had to obtain additional assistance [thus
285 GAMBLING away my retirement] to cover all the other issues (and there were
286 alot of them) ... and hat with the Stacked Deck local legal system and
287 the circus atmosphere of too many courtrooms (as so poignantly pointed 
288 out by the juror from Lake Oswego and some other famous cases lately) 
289 *PLUS* the known/feared power-base of the district AND board, I didn't 
290 care to waste THAT just to be further humiliated and, probably, further
291 officiall Blacklisted as an even WORSE troublemaker (if that's possible).
292  
293 I also DID consider the EEOC because, at the very least, the lawyer would
294 be from out of town and not enmeshed in he local tangled-web hierarchy.
295 But I'd also been told THAT option was equally as treacherous as the EEOC
296 had a horrendous history regarding their beneficial support and actual
297 assistance.  Even though from one lengthy conversation with them they DID
298 sound "interested" and stated not only that I could probably get the
299 older WP allegations covered through a "history of abuse" claim, but 
300 could also probably hold the Board accountable, I decided not to submit 
301 any further information to them either. From the sound of it now, I WAS
302 probably wise not to trust them.
303  
304 And since I had once previously testifed for somebody else before the
305 State Labor Commission (that we all PAY to handle such injustices), I
306 *KNEW* "THEY" weren't there to support us poor, taxpaying victims but
307 our much wealthier, more powerful employers ... which, in THAT case,
308 was a local large oil dealer owned by some historic city pillars.
309  
310 But in choosing to simply rant relentlessly & spout off at every even
311 remotely conceivable opportunity, even though I'm not GAMBLING my
312 retirement money, I do suppose I'm setting myself up for other abominable
313 atrocities (like for instance I hope **I'm** not hit by a bus).  But we
314 shall see, huh?  I just hope other innocents aren't suffering further
315 abuse due to my somewhat reckless-seeming pursuits.

324  
325 Wordplay ran through my mind as I traveled the path that day.  The words
326 have left me, and all that remains are a few fuzzy images.  My memory has
327  
328 never been my strongest point.
329  
330 My destination was something of a mystery to me.  It wasn't that I had no idea.
331 I did in fact have a fairly good one.  There were a limited number of choices.
332 It was part of this personal little ritual though that I did not decide until
333 the very last instant.  Life in those days was dull, and even a contrived 
334 mystery was a welcome diversion.
335  
336 Though the words may be fuzzy, I do remember the nature of the game.  Take 
337 a word, for instance apples.  Now, how many other words can you find in there?
338 And what sorts of rymes can you come up with after compiling these words.  It
339 can make for some interesting verse.  It pleases me to know that amongst the
340 chaos of this method, there is just a bit of order.
341  
342 I was always trying to find order in chaos, though it ill fit my nature in
343 many ways.  The town came into sight, and it was time for my first decision.
344 This one was in fact the easiest.  It simply consisted of wether I would
345 actually enter the town, or wether I would turn about and return to my
346 home.  The two hour walk made it unlikely that I would choose the later,
347 and in fact, I never had.  Though I believed that someday I would.  In any
348 case, that particular I decided to continue my journey.
349  
350 I walked first to the center of the town.  It was not a long walk, perhaps five
351 minutes. The streets were crowded with people going about their business, and
352 here and there children played.  At the center of the town was a large courtyar
353 perhaps one hundred and fifty feet on a side, and in its center was a fountain.
354 How the fountain worked was something of a mystery, but work it did, and nobody
355 was willing to risk breaking it meerly to satisfy idle curiosity.
356 Which was something of a shame, as I was anxious to learn its secrets.
357  
358 I'd reached the next decision point.

438 Rather than looking at sexual harassment in the workplace, maybe we could
439 just label it "gangsterism."  See, I don't think it's JUST men, the abuse
440 of woman against other women is almost worse and the Athenahood CAN abso-
441 lutely destroy a man ... but it's usually the wrong one.  From what *I've*
442 experienced of abuse in the workplace, women tend to "flock" around the 
443 "abusers" and create "office wife"-type relationships in order to get what
444 they want.  And it always seems the problem is compounded when you have a
445 Great Father at the top who "believes" he's creating that "happy American
446 family" workforce ... those families that are, according to statistics, 
447 primarily dysfunctional (97.3%).   If nothing else, I do think the sexual
448 harassment portion of the confirmation hearings, was a definitive study of
449 the American workplace.

461 I don't believe that ones gender has anything to do with ones honousty and
462 morality.  I'd bet there are atleast as many dysfunctional woman out there
463 as there are men.  One of the things that has always annoyed me about
464 all the male bashing is that these woman don't seem to realize that the
465 stereo typical mocho male bulshit is just as big a pain in the ass for
466 a significant number of men.  If your wimpy/nerdy/shy and hetero, be 
467 prepared for a life of hell.  Most males pick on you because your the 
468 victom type, and most females treat you like dirt because your not the
469 macho type.
470  
471 Most of this comes early on, and by the late teens people mellow a

738 I see nothing wrong with giving kids guidlines.  Its just a matter of how
739 far you go.  Teaching a kid to respect others even if they disagree with
740 them for instance doesn't seem like a bad thing.  Teaching them to take
741 responsibility for their own actions (A lesson Ronny and Olly never
742 got tought.), not to mention giving them a sense of the repurcusions of 
743 their actions.
744  
745 I suspect that if you love and respect your children, and let them be
746 their own persons, then things will work out.  If they don't, then 
747 there are atleast two possibilities.  1, you didn't do as well as you
748 thought you were, or 2, the kid has a problem such as being hyperactive,
749 dyslexic, etc.

884 also just informed that Randi Nailon-Posts quit and Susan Larsen has usurped
885 that position and that Avis Austad is now part of that PFT-CE conspiracy.
886 Avis is the one who "accidently" didn't order me a hard disk when she 
887 ordered one for everyone else, even though I was the only one who had been
888 using a computer.  Carlos Taylor had to come over and settle THAT one. Avis
889 was pissed because even though she'd blackmailed Rich Cole into buying 
890 $3,500 dedicated word processor for her and another secretary in order not
891 to have to learn to use a computer, the rest of the department voted in
892 computers.  As it ended up, the value ofo the expensive machines was nil ...
893 and I suppose they were pawned off to some unsuspecting SCHOOL.  Avis left
894 the department when Rich left in some kind of musical chairs exercise they
895 left EVERYONE in awe.  I think I've gone into all this before.  Left me just
