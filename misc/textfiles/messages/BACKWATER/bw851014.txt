22     First attempt to open communications was greated with deafining silance.
23     Could that vast object be a dirlect he wondered.  Eather that or they cant
24 transmit voice or maybe thair all incapacitated and no one can make it to the
25 bridge?
26     Just about that Elextia who had been roused by the commotion poked her head
27 into the cocpit.  "What's that?" she asked.
28     "Eather were just in time or maybe were way too late"
29     Easing herself into the other seat, all professional efficiancy, sleep
30 suddenly forgotten she asked; "Have you identified a hold or some large,
31 possibly preassurized interior space"
32     With deft fingers Themnax called up immages of possibale candidates to
33 on of her secondary monitors.  "Are you thinking what I think you are?"
34     #You bet you bippy# she replied inside my head, always the perfact tele-
35 path.
36     Aloud she spoke; "Stand by for etherial flip.  On my count. one, two, now!"
37     The reality storm became a harmless pattern of blue lines one another of
38 the ubiquotios monitor screens as we moved toward the point of interstructural
39 interpenitration.
40     "Wait and please hold"#I think i sense something - stll ...#
41     "YES!  Got it" Elxtia said turning toward him.  "There are at least two
42 possibly more active telepaths on board.  I also sense several mysteries and a
43 great straingeness.  The are indeed here as a resault of the 'storm' though
44 there are several other factors and they might be able to break free without 
45 our assistance.  Nothing wrong with improving the odds for them though.  I 
46 think the only reason they didnt voice acnowledge your call was that no one 
47 was on the bridge at the time.  Two walked in immediatly afterword and are 
48 there now.  I've also found a good spot for our internal docking.  If you turn
49 over your panel to mine I believe I can guide us in."
50      Without further ado Themnax did just that.  They glided smoothly through
51 outer and inner hull and were fully inside and clear of all surfaces before
52 he reached out and flipped the toggle which rematerialized them.
53      Elxtia docked with a gravity activated surface without further aid or
54 interferance from Themnax.  
55      Unfortunately this portion of the ship doesnt appear to be preassurized at
56 the moment" was her comment as the drives spun down.  "Time to try another comm
57 only be sure to use maximum attenuation.  At this non-range it'd be easy to 
58 overmodulate.
59      "pell-mell, pell-mell; this is a fly in your gut.  request permission to
60 have come aboard and could we have some atmosphere down here?"

63    Tariya walked over to the console in front of James. She reached for the keyboard. "Tell me how this thing
64 works."
65    James grabbed her wrists gently but firmly and moved them away from the sensitive controls. "No thank you. I really
66 don't feel like touring the Andromeda galaxy today." He ignored her smouldering glare as he adjusted the navicomp.
67 "Just tell me where. I'll pilot."
68    "We can't go after the adventurers directly." she said. "First we have to find them."
69    "You said you knew where they were."
70    "I said I knew how to find them. That's the next best thing."
71    Oh, swell. A detour. James silently groaned. Time's awastin'... "Where do we have to go to find out where we have
72 to go to find them?" Did he actually say that?
73    "It's a very powerful mystic focal point called the Crystal Palace." She looked at him like he was supposed to
74 recognise the name.
75    He said, very patiently, "That tells me nothing. Do you have some coordinates I can type in to the computer."
76    "You don't need coordinates. Anybody who knows magic knows where the Crystal Palace is. It's basic
77 knowledge."
78    "Well, maybe it's basic to you, sweetheart, but it sure ain't..." His voice faded in amazement as he glanced at the
79 computer screen. The voice recognition circuits must have been on because the screen read:
80 CRYSTAL PALACE LOCATED 90 DEGREES LATITUDE NORTH
81 PLANET AMPHYRIAN
82 SYSTEM RIGEL
83 COORDINATES:
84 and it read off a long list of numbers. Beneath this information flashed a single word: IGNORAMOUS. James thought he
85 heard something like a snicker behind him but when he turned around Tariya was looking elsewhere. "Swell." he sighed.
86 "Can't even get respect from my own computer."
87    He typed in the numbers (with some modifications) and hit the button labeled COMMIT. Outside, the cylinder glowed
88 and suddenly dissappeared with a flash and a BANG of imploding air.
89    James sat back in his pilot's chair and said, "Well, we're on our way."

98     Emu didn't understand the ill feeling that he had received from the psi
99 shield set up by Tayree.  What Cragmore had said didn't sound right, Emu
100 could tell that much, but his minimal psi training couldn't tell him what
101 was wrong.  The ill feeling could not have come from a privacy shield.  There
102 was something more to it...
103     He shrugged it off.  At the moment, it was much more important to get
104 the Pell-Mell out of 'here' (where ever that may be) and to a more recogni-
105 zable space and time.
106     As he and Trainor returned to the control room, with Cragmore lagging
107 behind, they heard the external comm speaker crackling  "... pell-mell; this
108 is a fly in your gut.  request permission to have come aboard and could we
109 have some atmosphere down here?"
110     Trainor and Emu looked questioning at each other, each hoping the other
111 had understood the speaker.  Getting no help that way, Trainor checked the
112 immediate external sensors.  Getting nothing, he tried the internals.  Down
113 in the lowermost hold, primarily used for methane product storage, but
114 currently empty, was a small dot, not quite deciferable, but definitely
115 expending a large amount of energy.
116     Trainor had an intruder!
117     "Intruder, please identify yourself immediately!  I repeat, identify
118 yourself immediately!"  Emu watched as Trainor awaited the reply.

132 
133   The piper lagged behind as the group of adventurers moved, first to an
134 obscure room at the end of a hall, then back towards the control room.
135 As the others walked on, chattering about what could be going on, the piper
136 stopped to rest, leaning against one of the less ornate decorative panels
137 lining the hallway.  Feeling nauseated by the bone-deep pain of his wounded
138 arm, the piper rested his head against the bas-relief carving never noticing
139 the rather intimate proximity it put him to a dryad engaged in what some
140 cultures would prudishly term "deviant conduct."  Even the built-in 
141 scourges of early childhood training could not raise the color in his face
142 as he glance down the hallway with an unseeing eye.  The footsteps and
143 conversation of the others died away from his ears as he returned to the
144 pale green door in the passageway and sat next to it.  By now his thoughts
145 were occupied with a small figure wrapped in flowing grey robes, facing
146 the unknown with a gallant smile.  Sw
147 (oops)  Squirming to find a more comfortable spot on the floor, he closed
148 his eyes to rest for a brief moment.

151   The wounded woman relaxed under lady Tayree's soft touch.  Relaxing, she
152 loosed her grip on the grey cloak that was wrapped around her, soft as 
153 thistledown except for the heavy dampness that was drying blood.  As her
154 eyes closed, the weight of the blood-soaked cloth pulled the cloak down
155 across her left shoulder baring part of her blood-stained torso.  Lady
156 Tayree's eyes were drawn to the crudly sutured wound that reached from
157 near the center of her chest nearly a third of the way across her left breast.
158 Only the soft sound of her breathing filled the air.

163      "...identify yourself immediately!" Shutting off the intercom, Trainor
164 turned to Emu. "Remember what I said about what was going to happen next?
165 I think next has happened."
166      "I would tend to agree with you. Whatever this thing is, it managed to
167 get on board without triggering any of the on-board alarm systems. We would
168 have heard the claxon, even with all the screaming going on. Things are 
169 getting curiouser and curiouser."
170      "What is curiouser and curiouser?" Bard stepped in to the control room.
171      "Where have you been Bard? You took off before us." Trainor had a habit
172 of answering questions with more questions.
173      "Oh, even in space nature calls. The ship's head is fabulous. I
174 especially like the Pygmalion/Galatea mural."
175      "Glad you are impressed" Trainor beamed.
176      "Ok, enough of the appreciation society. We have to figure out what
177 this ship or whatever is." Emu said with a snort.
178      "What ship?" Bard continued.
179      "Take a look, Bard. It somehow materialized in our methane hold. The hold
180 isn't pressurized for this trip, it's completely sealed. But somehow, someway,
181 something got down there. And that something called to us." Trainor fingered
182 the communications console, and repeated his challenge.
183      As soon has he finished, a deafening squeal filled the control room. It
184 was quickly followed by what sounded like hastily formed apologies. Indeed,
185 whatever or wever was in the small craft was speaking again. Trainor, Emu,
186 Bard, and Cragmore, who just entered the control room after a small detour
187 himself, hung close to the console, all ears attuned to the words coming
188 from deep within the Pell-mell.

217 Themnax:  Where is Dreamtoucher?  He's ONE character of your making that I 
218 can comfortably interact with.  Strange figures in cloaks with strange names
219 and devices make me a tad nervous.  Dreamtoucher, like myself, however, is
220 a creature "from nature" and can understand things in a way not many 
221 people can..  For instance, how many people do you know who can carry on
222 an evening conversation about the woodland, without falling asleep.  As
223 sad a fact as it is, it is true.  So where is the "Elven Mystic" as you so
224 long ago dubbed him.  Mayhap he might soon pop up at the Inn?  And be sure
225 to bring along Snowrunner....er...that is..if she isn't all that hungry.

278 Darkness surrounds me, the stink of death fills the air 
279 Reaching out, I grasp for support. A friendly hand touches mine.
280 I am lifted from the dark waters, I am wraped in a warm blanket,
281 but it is tight, it constricts. I feel a tightness in my chest,
282 I hear a splash, and suddenly I am pulled back into the water.
283 A great weight pulls me down, and as water fills my lungs 
284 with my dying breath, the sound of laughter echos in my ears.

288 About ten minutes later, my intercom buzzed for attention.
289 I cursed several unique curses, got up from the workbench upon which my
290 Passkey was in several pieces, and answered it.  "Rebalsa here."
291 "Your box was sent like you wanted, Bert."  It was Stan Wendill, chief
292 transmitter engineer.  "The energy source disappeared afterwards."
293 "So?"  I said.  "You've got the coordinates, haven't you?"
294 "Yes, that's not the problem."
295 "What exactly IS the problem?"
296 "The energy intake of the 'box dropped to fifteen g.v. during transfer, so
297 we sent a drone to see what was on the other end."
298 I recovered from the temporary shock.  Normal 'box energy use was about twenty
299 times that- 300 gv.  "What did you find?  A blue phone booth?"
300 Stan sounded puzzled.  "No, why did you ask that?  Never mind.  There wasn't
301 anything there, Bert.  Empty space.  No sign of dimensional disturbance,
302 either.  Would you care to explain what happened to that box we sent?"
303 I thought of something.  "Hold on."
304 I quickly snatched up the stabilizer circuit I had purchased and scruntinized
305 it closely.  Bingo.
306 "Stan?  Er, I'm leaving for today.  If you'd like an answer within oh, the
307 next week, you'd better have dinner with me while I think this through.
308 Bring your vesluc.  We're going to need the number crunching available.
309 
310 "All right.  I DO want an answer.  See you in ten."
311 I broke contact, and stared at the little grey chip that shouldn't be there.
312 For no possible function could it serve, yet... it was tied in inexorably with
313 the rest of the board.  Quickly, I gathered a repair kit and the remainder of
314 my Passkey, found parts enough to build a second passkey if the occasion
315 warranted, and left my office.

352 L'homme: I thank you for the offer on the book, but I think that I may
353     get a book for myself after all.  I've got one with the basic Intel
354     mneumonics (what a joke!), and that will get me through another week
355     or two, until I need some binary codes for those ops.  Those I could
356     just xerox (s'cuse me, photocopy).  I thought about putting in additions
357     to my assembler, but as I'm working alone and have too many things to
358     do outside of that already, so I'll just concentrate on clean code.  I
359     would like to get together and get that QX-10 disk copied now that I
360     have some new clean disks.  I'm around campus all day, so let me know
361     when we can plan a collision...

430 !psu-cs!nelsons: Hail Hail, all Intel's here. You are not being forced to use INTEL's crazy coding are you? Microsoft
431 may make some buggy software, but at least their ASSEM86 format is much easier to understand, and much easier to
432 parse. The Intel assembler is much more strongly typed and it requires much more intelligence in the parser because
433 some instructions can not be determined until the last of the opcodes are read in. Go with the Microsoft book, using
434 the Intel iAPX8086/88 book as an additional source of information. Also, by using Microsoft's format, the assembler can
435 be tested by running the same assembler source through a 'real' commercial assembler and comparing the binary output.
436 About the only difference between the source code for your assembler and the M.S. assembler is segment and offset
437 information because your assembler will probably be single segment and the segment words are not needed in the parser.
438 I will try to collide sometime soon on campus. I need some more help with the 4107 and since you have had far more
439 experience with it that I you should be able to help me. Piper is also giving me some help. I gotta get this 485=490

443 "Here's the story, Stan," I began as we settled into my favorite booth at the
444 local eatery.  "I was stranded on some backwater planet by 'skippers yesterday.
445 They smashed my Passkey, but it worked just enough to get me to the coordinates
446 you transmitted the box towards.  Somehow they sent me back, after I made a
447 deal to get a spare stabilizer circuit.  What's crazy is," I pulled out the
448 circuit board from my vest pocket, "this thing is DS standard except for that
449 little grey thing."
450 I passed it to Stan and he studied it.  "I think I should use the vesloc on it.
451 Wake up, Harvey."
452 The VEry Small LOgical Computer sprang to electronic life, and spoke.  "Ready
453 for operations, Stan."
454 "Good.  Lock scanners upon object held in my right hand, and report on data
455 obtained.  Summary first."
456 The vesloc was silent for quite some time, so I ordered dinner for both of us.
457 Synthetic stuff, mostly, but a hard-working dimensional supervisor can afford
458 some real vegetables once in a while.
459 "Object is a modified DS stabilizer circuit, model number-"
460 "Stop!" Stan interrupted.  "State nature of modifications."
461 "Non-standard circuitry of unknown origin.  Signs indicate manufacture b
462 undiscovered human race.  Manner of operation unknown.  This unit's sensors
463 may be in error.  Scanners indicate that interior of circuit does not exist."
464 "Empty space?  Is that it?"
465 "Negative.  Soundings indicate that depth of device is of a negative value."
466 Stan looked peeved.  "That's it.  NEXT time I have this thing serviced at
467 a competent repair shop."
468 "Don't bother.  It's not broken."
469 The implications dawned on Stan as our food arrived.  We ate slowly, but hardly
470 tasted the food as we thought of what this might mean.
471 "Dimensional control of this magnitude...such accuracy!  Great Space!" Stan
472 exclaimed.  "What COULDN'T we do with this thing?"
473 "Great Un-Space, you mean.  We still don't know how it works.  That's why
474 I'm taking an extended leave of absense.  I'll work on it in my lab at home."
475 Stan stared at me, thought about it.  "I'll help you."
476 That's the offer I'd hoped for.  I extended my hand.  "Shake on it, partner."

523      Reality storm?  Isn't that what Dreamtoucher had called it?  This 
524 sudden turmoil before me, a white-gray mass of blinding light clashing with
525 midnight dark.  A whirling firey "portal" that seemed to be hanging, pa
526 paper thin, in front of my table,.  I sheilded my eyes, hoping that this
527 "storm" would go away very soon.
528      And suddenly, peering out from my hcover,  I saw that is truly WAS over,
529 for the moment.  Sighing in relief, my mind slowed down long enough to let me
530 wonder what had caused it, and if it had any connection with the way my senses
531 kept picking up faint traces of Dreamtoucher and Snowrunner.  
532      Suddenly, a hand gently touched my forhead, and I quickly scampered back
533 towards the wall, turning my eyes up to see who had done this.
534      I was greeted by the young eyes of an elf.  Dreamtoucher and Snowrunner
535 stood before my table, and I thought I could just barely sense another 
536 near them, but my sense of this being eluded me...
537      And that was when I began to feel a tingle in the back of my mind, like a 
538 small wind, winding through my mind's channels.  
539      And then a rush of words, of sentences, bursting like a butterfly
540 from it's cocoon and dlflittering about inside me.  And best of all, I could
541 understand it!
542      "Hello, Zephyr.  Greetings from Dreamtoucher."
