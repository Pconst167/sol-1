26    Marannon Qoasis xennon-Silmarilyn stepped fully out of the shadows. She looked about fifty or so (she had to be)
27 and there was a merciless hardness to the lines of her face. James knew instantly that nothing would ever touch this
28 woman. Any humanity in her had long died out. He tried to struggle to his feet but failed. His wounds were healing
29 incredibly fast, but not quite that fast. "You set this all up, didn't you?"
30    She paused for a moment before answering. "You are rumored to be quite intelligent. Why don't you tell me what you
31 think happened."
32    "Okay, I will. This was a power play. A coup. You couldn't destroy the circle on your own, so you decided to bring
33 in some outside muscle. Me. Of course to lure the right fish you need the right bait. You did something to cause
34 Tariya to become restless and leave her home. And by some means or other you guided her to the Inn, where I was,
35 though God knows how you knew. You kept an eye on us while I tried to go about my quest. Unfortunately, we kinda got
36 sidetracked." He coughed into his hand. No blood. He was healing. "It took you a while to find us again. By then you
37 had gotten impatient. If you didn't get me soon, you wouldn't need me at all. So you sent bounty hunters after me.
38 They watched until the right moment, and grabbed me. I'll bet you weren't counting on Tariya coming along to rescue me
39 or us busting loose and getting away." He saw from her expression that he had hit a bullseye.
40    He continued, "I didn't get really suspicious until Tariya announced that you had the means that I had been looking
41 for to cure myself for so long. Sure, coincidences happen, but that was a bit much for even me to swallow. Only three
42 of those gems exist, and one suddenly, conveniently surfaces... Anyway, what clinched it was the news that you had
43 seceded almost the day she had left, knowing it would lead to war. After hearing that, I asked myself a few hard
44 questions about everything that was going on. I'd have to be an idiot not to see it. Tariya was supposed to bring me
45 here, and the gem was a bargaining chip, a lever to get me to do what you wanted. Only it turned out you ddn't need
46 it. Did I leave anything out?"
47    Marannon clapped her hands. "Amazing. You are as intelligent as they say. You only missed one point. I didn't do
48 anything to make Tariya leave. She volunteered."
49    He felt a chill run through him. "What?"
50    "Your book," she explained, "is very widely read. Somehow she got ahold of a copy over a year ago. Ever since then
51 she has been obsessed with the Destroyer."
52    "With... me?" James said in a small voice.
53    "She thought I didn't know, and I let her play her little game of secrecy. I saw no harm in it and it mattered
54 little. But I suddenly saw a very important part for you in my little coup. I asked her if she would meet you to bring
55 you back. She jumped at the chance."
56    Now he was confused. "But why did she go along with me when she could have brought me here?"
57    She suddenly looked troubled. "I... don't know. As far as I could tell, she didn't want to return. She is very
58 adventuresome. As I once did. Though she is my last, she is still my favorite." She caught the angry gleam in James'
59 eye and, a little nervously, asked, "What's the matter?"
60    "You-you..." He was so mad that it took him a minute to calm down enough to speak. "She was adventuresome, all
61 right. And she always got into trouble." He had to cough again. This time there was blood. "She... got... DEAD! And
62 it's all your fault!"
63    "My fault?" Marannon looked genuinely confused.
64    "You let her go knowing full well what could've happened! I did everything in my power to save her, but finally it
65 wasn't enough! You could have done something! But I'm going to do something. As soon as I get up off this floor, I am
66 going to slice you to pieces!"
67    As if lecturing a little child, she said, "In the first place, you don't have the power. What little you DO have is
68 engaged in keeping you alive and will be for quite some time to come. Second, I know of your feelings for her. And she
69 loves you very deeply. Why would you want to hurt her by murdering her mother?"
70    James slammed his fist into the floor, which stubbornly refused to break. Tears were streaming down his cheeks.
71 "Stop it! Stop talking about here like she's still here! I can't hurt her any more because she's dead!"
72    In a matter-of-fact voice, Marannon said, "But she isn't dead."

105    The Hell Machine
106          (2)
107    
108    Not quite meanwhile:
109    "He was supposed to be here half an hour ago!" Frank Lindstrom paced restlessly around the basement lab of the
110 Mechtronix, Inc. Portland annex. He couldn't pace far, as the room was all but packed with sophisticated equipment. He
111 managed a circle maybe five feet in diameter. It distracted the others.
112    "You know Roy." Replied Jean Lambert. She was sitting at Frank's monitoring station, trying to make sense of the
113 screens. A physicist she wasn't. "Responsibility is not his forte."
114    "Tell me about it." Frank sighed. "But he sounded so worried. He made me promise to postpone until he got
115 here."
116    Norbert Howell looked up from the X-men comic he had been reading at his station, "Well, we can't postpone much
117 longer. The capaciters won't hold this big a charge very long without burning up something expensive. If we don't start
118 in the next few minutes, I'll have to shut down. It'll take at least a week to clean up and restart the
119 reactor."
120    "Damn." Frank muttered.
121    Jean got up and went down to the lower level where the fourth member of the team was sitting. "Douglas? How are you
122 feeling?"
123    Douglas Everett looked up from the photograph he was holding. "O-okay, I guess. I'm... I'm still ready to try, if
124 you are."
125    "Good." She was worried about Doug. He was emotionally unstable and lightly retarded. He had been married until
126 about a year ago, and then his wife, Alice, had left him for another man. The shock put him in an institution, from
127 which he had only been recently released. Alice had contacted him not long after about the possiblity of a
128 reconciliation. Doug had been overjoyed. Alice was the only light in an otherwise dismal life. Then, about two days
129 ago, he recieved news that she had been killed in a skiing accident on Mt. Hood. He did not lose his grip on reality
130 again, as everybody feared he might, but something in him had definitely changed. There were those who thought it might
131 have been better if he had lost it again.
132    Frank sat down in his chair and scanned the readouts. "Everything's peaked for the conditions. It'll take us more
133 like a month to recalibrate." He looked around at them. "If Roy's not going to show, then I can't take his warning very
134 seriously. He is prone to exaggeration. I say we go ahead. Any objections?"
135    There were none.
136    "Stations, then." Frank said. He started the videotapes. Norbert stashed his comic and began tuning the reactor
137 controls. Doug pocketed the photograph and sat back as Jean placed the electroencephelagraphic helmet on his head. The
138 entire experiment hinged on Doug. He had been long ago tested and found to have very strong psionic abilities. He
139 couldn't conciously read minds or bend spoons, but the potential was there. That potential was what made it possible
140 for the helmet to read images from his brain. Those images were comverted to computer impulses and fed into the heart
141 of the experiment, the Genesis machine.
142    The Genesis machine was a small cube, about two inches on a side (Norbert, with his comic-book humor, had dubbed it
143 the 'Cosmic Cube'). It was mirrored-silver and consisted of a non-conducting alloy formed around highly complex
144 circuitry. It hung suspended behind thick glass at one end of the room with wires attached to each of its six sides.
145 The processes in the Genesis machine were far too complicated to explain, but its theoretical purpose was to convert
146 energy to matter. Norbert's fusion plasma reactor would supply energy in abundance, and the images from Doug's brain,
147 far more detailed that anything a computer could generate, would provide a pattern for the forming matter. Assuming the
148 whole thing worked, which was iffy. Frank controlled the link from his console. Jean's task was to coach Doug and watch
149 his condition.
150    Norbert called out, "Output: seven point three two five gigavolts. Reactor at optimum."
151    Frank answered, "All components read good. Temp on capaciter bank four is a little high."
152    "Told ya."
153    "Jean?" Frank called down.
154    Jean looked at Doug. "Now remember, just like we practiced. Visualise the cylinder. Concentrate on its every aspect.
155 Concentrate."
156    "I've got it." Frank watched as a computer enhanced image of a cylinder appeared on his screen. He made some last
157 minute adjustments. "All readings within safe limits. Voltages consistant, feed noise point oh oh oh four. Looks good,
158 folks." Excitement surged though him. The greatest scientists in the world hadn't even dreamed of something like
159 this...
160    A platform rested at the opposite end of the room from the cube, hidden behind lead shielding. It was where the
161 object was supposed to materialise. Frank said, "Vector coordinates," and read out a series of numbers. Norbert read a
162 list of numbers off an auxiliary screen and concurred. Frank transmitted the numbers to the cube, in essence telling it
163 to focus its power on the platform.
164    Jean watched Doug's vital signs on a monitor. They showed he was as excited as the rest of them. Completely
165 professional now, she coached Doug verbally while continuously taking readings on his brainwaves. The peaks and valleys
166 were greatly exaggerated, which was normal for him.
167    Jean said nothing to them, which Frank took as an all clear. He flipped a final switch. Now Doug was linked via
168 computor directly to the cube. The Genesis machine was ready. All it needed now was power. "The cube is primed." Frank
169 said. "It's all yours, Norbert."
170    "Voltage seven point four oh five. Transmitting... now." Norbert snapped a single large black switch, feeding the
171 full output of the reactor (enough power to incinerate a small town) to the Genesis machine. For exactly one second the
172 cube shone like a miniature sun.
173    And then all hell broke loose...

187 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
188   The piper found himself at the end of a very large empty hallway.  It seemed
189 to receede behind him into the infinite distance, and before the same.  He
190 was walking, slow even steps that raised no echoes down the softly resilient
191 floor, past miles and miles of blank corridor.
192   The changes came subtly.  He could not even notice when they first began.
193 First, slight shadows marked the endless walls of the corridor.  At first
194 they were imperceptable smudges, barely darkening the glowing walls, then
195 they sharpened into barely visible objects.  Some miles down the hallway,
196 the piper could discern that the objects were gathered into groups, each
197 object and each group growing more distinct as he traveled.
198   He was tempted to stop and puzzle out the objects, but found that hurrying
199 down the hallway to the next group brought more information.  Subtly, they
200 sharpened, taking clearer and clearer shape.  When, at last, he could see
201 clearly what lay before him, he reached out toward a shelf full of scrolls.
202   He was unable to touch them, his hand passing through them as though they
203 had been painted in the very air before him.  Shrugging he continued down
204 the softly glowing hallway, now lined with tables set along the right side
205 (the left side was still featureless).  As he walked, he brushed his hand
206 along the side of the hallway.  At first, he felt no resistance as he passed
207 by a table full of scrolls.  Later, a whisper of sensation as his hand
208 penetrated the seeming reality, intensifying as he moved on, made him pull
209 back to the center of the corridor.
210   Again, just when it became apparent escaped his notice, but far ahead of
211 him the corridor showed a change.  Far ahead desks began along the left
212 hand wall of the corridor, and the right hand wall became blank.  The
213 piper hurried down the hallway until he stood between the last desk on
214 the right-hand wall and the first desk on the left-hand wall.
215   He reached to the desk on the right hand wall and lifted up one of the
216 five scrolls that lay on its surface.  It had a reassuring solidity, the
217 twin handles seemed polished by long use where they extended from the
218 two cylinders of rolled material.  The material of the scrolls was soft and
219 flexible, somewhat like an extremely thin white leather.  Somewhat clumsily,
220 the piper grasped the handle extending from the right of one cylinder in
221 his right hand, the left handle of the other with his left hand and rolled
222 the two cylinders apart on the desk surface.

251 Once again it comes time for the monthly meeting of the Portland Computer Society. I'm affraid that I'll have to bow

253 __Leonard__: Please be sure the disks I gave you get to the intended parties. I believe they will be present. As for

259   As the scroll opened, the piper's attention focused on the surface that
260 slowly became revealed.  The symbols were unfamiliar, but seemed to hold a
261 meaning.  For long moments he pondered, then, as though a switch had been
262 thrown in his mind, he saw/felt/smelled/heard himself back in the inn.
263   He was simoultaneously experiencing the moments when the innkeeper had
264 disappeared, feeling the shock and dismay, feeling his own recklesness and
265 disregard for his own safety, and reading a scroll.  Reading the scroll,
266 he both participated in the action and observed the action.  He looked 
267 closer and saw the tangled motives that had led to disregarding his own
268 safety, and more important, disregarding the safety of the others that might
269 be foolish enough to follow his rash example.
270   He saw the pressures of dark loss... loss of the one creature that had given
271 him unreserved love, the loss of the pegasus.  He saw the loss of the woman
272 who had reached deep within his vulnerable heart,  the woman who had held
273 him on that dark plane between realities, who had wounded him much deeper
274 than the wound she had inflicted on herself with his knife, wounded him
275 in his image of self-worth.  She had not inteded to wound him...  she had
276 only wanted to return to her home and family... she had felt nothing more
277 than a vague liking, and he had not attempted to win a love that he felt
278 for her.
279   He saw the dark depression that he had harbored within him, building,
280 festering, eating at the roots of his soul.  He saw the dark, self-destructive
281 urges that were building, pressuring him to turn away from friends, ignoring
282 the helping hands that others had extended.
283   He saw the vanity, the foolish pride that had brought him here.
284   He was humbled.
285   Slowly the piper set the scroll down, looking first one way down the vast
286 hallway, looking at the records that faded into the past, then looked down
287 the other way looking at records fading into the future.
288   A mirror of yourself can show a cruel reflection.  It can show the weaknesses
289 and vanities that we try to pretend are not there.  It can show the strength,
290 the goodness, also -- but the small cruelties, the petty crimes against 
291 ourselves and others, the unreasonable vanities, somehow seem to weigh 
292 much heavier.  The piper looked at himself, dropped his face into his hands
293 and cried.
294   Some time later, the piper gained a grip on himself and realized that in
295 his awful egotism he had endangered the person that he had ostensibly gone
296 to "rescue."  In his mad dash, he had endangered a friend -- not gone to
297 recue him, but gone to seek death himself.  In doing so, he had fouled up
298 any legitimate rescue attempts, and perhaps suceeded in killing himself as
299 well as the innkeeper.
300   With a heavy heart the piper yielded to the gossamer tug of the line that
301 connected him to his body.  He no longer tried to avoid the pain of the 
302 return, he welcomed it as punishment for his foolishness, at the same time
303 despising the impulse that caused him to want to punish himself.
304   Scenes began to flicker as the silver cord that bound him to his body
305 began to thicken.  The gentle pull became greater, the speed increased,
306 increaseing the pull and thickness of the cord.
307   Suddenly, the universe seemed to *snap* around him.  He was in his body
308 again, cringing against the expected pain as he drew a breath.
309 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
310 Freddy - thanks for the good words.  I don't write before I log onto
311 BW-- what you see here is "first-draft" stuff since I don't know where
312 the story has gone since my last entry.  In a multi-author setting, I might
313 have a story line worked out mentally, but find the situation completely
314 changed when my chance for an entry arises.  I do work out the broad outlines
315 pretty carefully, and often toss it totally out when it doesn't fit.
316 Also, I use a terminal, not a computer -- and with ENTER ONLY there's no
317 chance to fix a typo in a previous line...
318   I agree, polishing would help, but then there probably wouldn't be any
319 entries, either...

350 Sleep pulled at Milchar incessantly, attempting to lure him away from what he
351 felt was his duty, to watch Piper.  It was becoming harder to fight it off, and
352 once Milchar had dozed off for a few seconds athen snapped awake.
353 Usually it was possible for a mage to use a sleep-surrogate spell when it was
354 necessary to remain on watch for an extended period, but Milchar dared not risk
355 dipping any deeper into his shallow pool of magic reserve.  He had not felt
356 this drained since he had been placed under a dampening field during the Ruby
357 Valley adventure.
358 The Ruby Valley... it seemed to have happened only a few days ago.  Perhaps
359 the best thing that had happened there, aside from the saving of the people in
360 the Sapphire Valley, was Piper's meeting Peg.  Milchar wondered if Piper
361 and Peg would meet this day.
362 Cragmore's voice broke through Milchar's wall of thought.  "Something's
363 happening."

370 WHY?
371 :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(
372 YOU KNOW, I THINK THE MAIN PROBLEM THAT I AM HAVING WITH THE
373 MULTI-AUTHOR STORY, ASIDE FROM THE SLOW PACE, IS ALL THIS PSYCHIC
374 STUFF. JUST LIKE THE LAST STORY, MOST OF THE TIME IS SPENT STUCK
375 IN ONE PLACE WITH ALL THE CHARACTERS CONCENTRATING ON ONE 
376 CHARACTER. PERSONALLY, MIND-READING, TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION, 
377 AND MENTAL SURGERY (LIKE WAS PERFORMED ON TRAINOR) IS REALLY
378 QUITE UNREALISITIC AND HARD FOR OTHERS TO RELATE TO, MAKING 
379 A DULL, PLODDING STORY. (I KNOW THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY THE CASE
380 HERE BUT YOU GET MY POINT) PIPER, AT LEAST, IS TRYING TO 
381 BREATHE SOME LIFE INTO THE STORY WITH AN APPARENT UPCOMING PLOT
382 REVELATION THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTNG. MORE OF YOU SHOULD TRY THIS.
383 BRING IN SOME OUTSIDE INFLUENCES. INTRODUCE A MAJOR VILLAIN (IF 
384 NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO TRY THIS, I AM WILLING. THE VILLAIN ROLE 
385 SEEMS TO SUIT ME). GET SOME A*C*T*I*O*N GOING. NOT MENTAL ACTION,
386 BUT PHYSICAL. MAYBE EVEN SOME CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. YOU SEEM TO
387 HAVE SOME WEL-DEVELOPED CHARACTERS, BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I 
388 CAN'T SEE HOW, IF ALL THE STORES THEY WERE IN WAS LIKE THIS ONE.
389 PUSH THAT PLOT FORWARD! PUT SOME L*I*F*E INTO THAT STORY. I KNOW
390 YOU CAN DO IT, I'VE SEEN IT DONE. DON'T BE SO AFRAID OF USNG OTHER
391 PEOPLE'S CHARACTERS, OR TREADING ON THEIR TOES. EVERYBODY HAS IDEAS
392 ABOUT HOW THEY WANT THE STORY TO GO, BUT MAYBE SOME OF THESE IDEAS
393 NED TO BE SACRIFICED IN FAVOR OF ONES THAT WILL MOVE THE STORY BETTER.
394 OTHERWISE, YOU ARE LIKE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE TRYING TO MOVE A HEAVY
395 LOAD BUT EVERYBODY IS ON A DIFFERENT SIDE, PUSHING IN A DIFFERENT
396 DIRECTION. YOU WASTE A LOT OF EFFORT AND GET NOWHERE.
397 AGAIN, DON'T TAKE OFFENSE. I AM JUST TRYING TO CONSTRUCTIVELY
398 CRITISIZE. I KNOW NEGATIVE CRITICISM IS NOT POPULAR HERE, BUT 
399 SOMETIMES A BOOT IN THE BUTT WORKS MUCH BETTER THAN SOME WELL-
400 MEANING BUT UNDESERVED KIND WORDS. AND I THINK YOU WOULD ALL LIKE
401 TO IMPROVE, OR YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYING.

414   Freddy -- feel free to join in-- it IS a multi-author story, after all, and
415 the plot twists that someone else adds is a lot of the fun.  Please be 
416 cautious, however, about playing someone else's character.  We've found that
417 too many hard feelings come about when someone has not thought through how
418 another person's character would react to something their character did.
419   For example, I'd get pretty mad if someone caused the piper to come off
420 his sickbed swinging his skean dubh and cut Milchar's throat.  It's out
421 of character, and doesn't fit the motivations of the character.  It would
422 be easy to put words or actions into another's character to move into a plot
423 twist that you want to see.  Usually, the others will ignore an entry of
424 that sort. (By others, I mean other authors, of course.)
425   It does get slow, sometimes, but that's the hazard of communicating only
426 on the BBS through the story itself.  If you want to join, please do so,
427 come in with a different point of view, but communicate with your actions
428 and from your own viewpoint.  Let us react to you just as we would in
429 "real" life.  If it's convincing, you're part of the story.  If not, you're
430 in your own reality, divorced from ours.  You obviously are not within
431 the bard's transporter with the rest of us, but this reality is almost
432 totally unexplored.  If you wanted to postulate a chlorine-breathing,
433 slime-covered, farmer whose crops were sessile stomaches...

441         The Former came from under a pile of leaves. The horse and rider were
442 now trotting down the path. The trees dropped leaves and thin lines of sun on
443 them as they went on their way. The Former scrambled from the leaves and into
444 the road. No other riders were coming down the path.
445         A warmth spread over the Former. The source was a ditch the trees had
446 poured leaves into. The leaves were orange and red. There were spots where 
447 the leaves had fallen through. As if there were holes. The Former leaned to 
448 look at one of them.
449 The legends always said there was a place in the forest.
450         A leap into the ditch resounded with a shout of pain. The Former 
451 decided to silence himself and look again into the pits. Radiating warmth 
452 swept into him as if it was an invitation. The Former dropped himself down 
453 one of the pits like a child drops himself down a slide. 
454         The wetness filled the space between his hairs. Soon his fur was 
455 sopping in the liquid. Immersion frightened the Former and he waded across 
456 the water slowly. The water. The water was in the legends. Immersion was in 
457 the legends also and if they were true he was about to change. 
458         The liquid he was in was an aqueous collection of stories and legend 
459 and a few amino acid proteins to boot. The change would occur firstly in the 
460 endomorphin glands and then spread to the putuitary and learstin glands. A 
461 new physical form would result. 
462         The Former thought the process might lead him into another of the 
463 evolutionay stages his ancestors were lead into. Then again, it might be any
464 form and there was nothing to do. The Former slept a long time. 
465         He woke in a dream. A strange procession of what he was startled him
466 into the dream from sleep. A dove and a wolf diseased with rabies. The lives 
467 of animals who were not men always fascinated him. A mouse and a mouser. 
468 Their lives were his and he woke again. 
469         It was a tall tree he looked at. Standing from the roots he looked at
470 it ever higher. It was a tall tree indeed. And behind it stood a fine Inn and
471 a rowan tree. It took only a moment to travel to them. It was a longer time 
472 for anyone to notice the new apparition.
473         A tall and white animal. Two people in Old English dress drew swords 
474 and sent them into their scabbards once they noticed where they were and who 
475 was in the place. An inventor studied the motions of his legs for a moment 
476 and then observed the same motions of spiders on his table. The rest simply 
477 ignored him and went on with their conversances.
478         The face of a malamute and the proportions of muscularity and bones 
479 of one also. The animal was on hind legs and walked with faint difficulty. It
480 went to a table and got a piece of white cloth from a seamstress at a nearby
481 table and a few pieces of technology from a trader. As the night dawned on 
482 the Inn and the patrons inside it.

513     Hack and slash had its day here, but that day was a long time ago, and
514 many Inngoers have grown tired of the incessant action action action story
515 and wish to read something with a little thought and a little depth. But
516 people will complain if you try to put something they have to use their
517 noggins on, and others will complain if you write nothing about mindless
518 action. It's tougher than trying to please Siskel and Ebert. The critics
519 don't seem to like dialogue. They don't like long patterns of thought. Try
520 to combine the two, and you are accused of being long-winded. It's a
521 blasted shame that even the alleged friendly criticism comes in the form
522 of attack without alternative and tongue lashing for the sake of
523 exercise. Instead of wasting 40 lines displaying questionable grasp of
524 communication skills, write something yourself. Do, don't complain. Show,
525 don't tell. Stop your bloody pontificating, roll up your sleeves, and
526 demonstrate some of your own ability. We try not to write comic books
527 here, really we do. Don't condemn us for putting a little thought behind
528 what we do. Don't flame us for trying to introduce some morality into
529 our story lines. Understand that we realize that death is a part of life,
530 and can sometimes occur with the aid of a crooked dagger or a lighting
531 bolt, or can occur from within, no physical aids needed. Your head should
532 guide your actions, not some blood-lust or need for contant instant
533 gratification. How hollow that is.

556 Zephyr, and all who wish to join --
557   Please do.  It seems that we need a discussion of the appropriate rules
558 governing multi-author stories, however.  Those of us who have participated
559 in the various story lines have worked out a set of unwritten rules that
560 we hold to, but tend to be intolerant of those who violate our codes.
561 Perhaps we need to talk them out and reach a consensus as to what we consider
562 unacceptable.
563   We've got to realize that a multi-author story will often drag.  If a
564 person, for some reason, can't make an entry, the whole story can come to a
565 screeching halt.  On the other hand, putting explicit words or actions on
566 another character is pretty rude.  You might think you're acting in character
567 for another, but that person probably won't share that impression.
568   I use the technique of branching off from the main story to a sub-story
569 concerning my character to forward his development.  This avoids stalling
570 what I want to say when I have something particular to put into the story.
571 I try to avoid anticipating other's reactions to my character's actions.
572   It seems reasonable to use short bits of innocuous dialog to cover a 
573 conversation that happens, but *try* to keep the other's bits trivial and
574 not something that will cause them major difficulties later.  If you want to
575 add a twist to a story, bring it in, then wait.  Let the others involved
576 react before you rush ahead.

578   The scene that met the piper's eyes in the cramped confines of the bard's
579 transporter was confusing to say the least.  The bard whas the only person
580 in here when he had "left."  Now, he saw the familiar face of Milchar,
581 face lined and drawn with bone-deep fatigue, Cragmore standing aloof, looking
582 somehow disapproving, the bard looking with concerned eyes, and the innkeeper
583 kneeling on the floor in a coughing fit.
584   The piper drew another deep breath, flinching against the anticipated pain
585 that never materialized.  Even the Inn's golded autumn brew could not 
586 compare to the sweet feeling of air, air filled with the odor of too many
587 bodies in too close a space, air carrying the stench of too many trips through
588 a recycling unit, air carrying the pungent odor of burned rosin from the
589 bard's last attempt to force the electronics of the vehicle to perform feats
590 that exceeded the capabilities of the hardware.
591   He lifted himself on one elbow, reached out a hand and said:
592   "Milchar -- how?  Cragmore?  Innkeeper!  His lungs must be nearly eaten
593 away from the gas!"

598     Bard and Cragmore stood opposite each other, opposed in position as well
599 as opinion. The Innkeeper's coughing had calmed down, and he lay on the
600 floor, covered by a survival shawl that had been fetched by Bard from one
601 of his ship's multitude of storage lockers. Milchar still lay quiet on
602 a couch behind the other three. The piper still lay in apparent coma,
603 oblivious to what transpired on the ship.
604     "We *must* do something!" Bard cried, taking a step toward's Piper.
605     "Your something would be iniquitous Bard. We must not bother Piper
606 now. He has undertaken a journey that only he can complete. There must
607 be no outside interference.
608     Bard seemed to ignore Cragmore's words. He tool another step towards
609 the Piper; Cragmore shifted his position until again he stood between
610 Bard and Piper. Suddenly, the menacing tableau was interrupted by a
611 voice from behind them.
612     "Look! Look at Piper!" It was Milchar, who had finally stirred from
613 his sleep. Bard and Cragmore had been too intent on watching each other's
614 moves to notice Piper behind them. They turned on Milchar's words, and
615 witnessed a wondrous sight. Piper's eye lids flickered, his chest rose
616 and fell with much more pronouncement, and before anyone could say or
617 do anything, he sat up, blinked his eyes, and said with a clear. resonate voice,
618     "Milchar -- how? Cragmore? Innkeeper! His lungs must be nearly eaten
619 away from the gas!"
620     "The Innkeeper," Cragmore started, barely able to control his
621 excitement, "has not been affected by the atmosphere in the way you
622 might think." Then turning to Bard and Milchar, a teary-eyed Cragmore
623 said, "I was wrong about Piper, and I have never been so elated to be
624 wrong. But he did come back on his own choosing, as any self-motivating
625 intelligent creature should be allowed to do. I hope you can see my point
626 and forgive my error."
627     "Wrong? Forgive?" Piper's face revealed his lack of understanding at
628 what had transpired in the ship, but soon it would be revealed. PsI-Cragmore-
