22 DRINKS AT THE INN. EVEN OLD CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE
23 INN FOR MANY MONTHS SEEM TO HAVE DISAPPEARED. AND I SEEM TO
24 HAVE EVEN LOST MY FAVORITE BARMAID 'PAM'. THOUGH THE ROWAN 
25 TREE STILL STANDS IN FRONT OF THE INN, EVEN MANAGING TO PUT

31 MIKEY:
32 Perhaps if you look on the board that is known as Bit-Bucket you will find
33 our beloved Pam. I have seen her there and believe if you were to leave 
34 her a message there she might just return. We all miss her wit and compassio

40      We tromped through the forest for what seemed like days.  Other than
41 an occasional munchkin or small furry animal scuttling by, we didn't see
42 much.  On the second day though, an event occurred that would have
43 significant impact on out quest.  The woods had started to thin out, and we
44 could just catch glimpses of a clearing ahead.
45      As we neared the clearing, a small furry animal hesitantly hopped into
46 the middle of the yellow brick road and stopped.  Its brown, doelike eyes
47 stared up at us balefully.  Wassir did something that suprised me.  He 
48 pulled a crust of brad out of his pocket (one of our last, I must add) and
49 happily fed it to the small animal -- a serene smile on his face.  I kept
50 silent.
51      Finally, the animal went merrily on his way.  Wassir broke the silence;
52 "You know Salazar, that little animal is lucky... If McKane had been around,
53 he'd be a set of earmuffs by now."
54      "Mohammed, that's disgusting!"
55      "Yeah, well so's McKane."
56      As we started towards the clearing... a voice spoke as if inside our
57 heads.  #Thank you for the food, big ones#   As we looked around for the
58 speaker, it spoke again:   #If you ever need help, just call for us#
59 We could find no one.
60      When we reached the clearing, we found a large meadow with the road 
61 running through it.  Off in the distance, spires of a magnificent city were
62 visible.  The meadow was filled with bright yellow blossoms which gave offf
63 a sweet aroma.  
64      Wassir started quickly into the meadow.  I held him back and said; 
65 "Hold it Mohammed, didn't you ever see the Wizard of Oz on TV?"
66      "Albanians don't fool with capitalist toys such as TV's."
67      "Well, you should have.  Those nice looking flowers are lotus blossoms.
68 Go out these and you'll have wonderful dreams...  Forever."
69      "O.K., what do we do now?"
70      "Bushwhack along the edge of the forest and go around the meadow."
71      As we turned to enter the forest, a tremendous whooshing sound came 
72 from behind us.  The light from the sun was blocked by an enormous shadow.
73 We both hit the ground.  My .44 jumped into my hand.  Glancing up, I saw a
74 gigantic creature.  Its belly consisted of large greenish-blue scales.
75 Carried by stout leathery wings, a long tail followed behind it.
76      As it disappeared in the distance, Wassir gasped; "What was that?"
77      "A dragon.  That can mean only one thing... The Dragon Lady must be
78 involved in this.  We'll have to tread warily.  We don't have the firepower
79 to cross lances with her."
80      With a sense of apprehension, we headed into the forest.  The city lay
81 ahead of us.

83 P.S. Mikey -- Regarding our conversation the other night... Made contact
84 with Pam.  She said that her disappearance from your friendly Inn was due
85 to a combination of a broken modem and pressing obligation.  She should
86 return by the first of the month.  Not a result of anything you did.  --V--

91 I WOULD HAVE LEFT PAM A MESSAGE AT BIT B., BUT IT SEEMS
92 THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND IT FOR TOO LONG A TIME, AND
93 I NO LONGER HAVE WRITE ACCESS TO IT. SINCE I COULDN'T GET
94 PAM TO RESPOND, I WAS WORIED THAT IT WAS SOMETHING I SAID
95 OR DID THAT SCARED HER OFF.

98    Finally I was able to smile. "you mean we've both been waiting just to hear which side the other was on?  Don't worry about
99 me, I'm on whatever side looks like will keep me breathing. And Leroy isn't out to get me or I'd be got by now.  In fact, he
100 was the one who got me out of my financial problems more than once."
101     "Since it turns out we are on the same side, why don't you try to find some way to get out of this current reality. If
102 Leroy is in south america, I suggest we try there."

122   The group seemed somewhat quieted by the incursion of a stranger into their
123 midst.  The metal man began to speak to the piper -- "nev-er-the-less, it does
124 not squreek grawdb mxflb normb nonrem exprevb ..." the metal man stopped.
125   Perplexed by this seeming malfunction, the piper stood a moment then noticed
126 a motion behind him.  Out of the same door from which Tik-toc had come, an old
127 lady was walking.  Her step seemed rather sprightly despite her snow-white 
128 hair.  Her face was filled with wrinkles, but radiated a lively good humor.  She
129 walked over to Tic-k-toc and removed a large brass key from a hook on the back of
130 his neck.  Inserting the key in an opening under his left arm, she quickly 
131 wound up the mechanism.  Tik-toc turned to her, bowed and said "thank you 
132 dorothy, my think-ing mech-an-isms was be-in used quite heav-e-ly."
133   The piper looked at the old lady and gasped, "You -- you're Dorothy ?????"
134   She smiled at the confounded piper and replied, "Dorothy Gale, late of Kansas
135 and for about the last 60 or 70 years of the land of Oz.  What can we do for 
136 you and your party?"
137   The piper was lost for words.  "But - but - you were supposed to be a little
138 girl!  How -- I mean why -- but -- but"
139   Dorothy smiled at the confused man.  "You mean how and why am I now old?  
140 You should know, being an expert on modifying realities yourself.  Remember, the
141 existance of Oz is  dated from the publishing of the first book, 'The Wizard of
142 Oz' by L. Frank Baum.  When this book first was read, the land of Oz took on
143 its existince.  Many other books followed, each enriching the texture and 
144 content of the land and bringing in many and fabulous creatures.  I assumed 
145 existance as about 8 years old and lived for many years in Oz without aging.
146 Some years later, I returned to the United States looking for Ozma's father and
147 aged those years in an instant.  I decided at that time to never leave Oz again.
148 All was well for several years until they mad that movie.  I have never quite
149 forgiven Hollywood for that act.  In the space of a few short months, I had to
150 go through puberty!  After puberty, the aging process cannot be arrested, so
151 I have aged at a normal rate until now.  I hope that answers your questions
152 and we can now take up the subject of your appearance here.  We do not wish to
153 appear unkind, but we do not want troops of vagabonds invading our pleasant 
154 reality tracking mud on the clover, fighting and bleeding on our lanscape."

276 jazz (?!?), but nevertheless, I'm having a good time here.  Maybe
277 deDDDEBORAH [sic!] has a good idea, but if you are looking to trade
278 software or used bottle caps or whatnot, try another BBS.  Everybody is
279 having too good a time on this one.  Besides, I want to await the return

415 Deborah -- I'm always game for an argument.  What subject would you like, and
416 what side would you like me to argue on?  (please don't cast me as pro- 
417 mercy killing small fuzzy animals !)
418 To the rest of the party -- come on folks, let's convice the lady that we are
419 worth helping.  All is obviously not as it seems!
420 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

422 
423 Deborah:
424 
425 I'm certainly not against getting a good arguement going. It's 
426 the diversity of Backwater that makes it interesting and even 
427 I admit that too much fantasy can get old. My concern is in  
428 how we transition from fantasy to seriousness and back.
429 
430 I've been following Backwater for some time now and I've
431 observed a pattern. 
432 
433 When the serious folks dominate the screen the fantasy folks 
434 politely wait for them to run out of things to say. They then 
435 offer a bit of whimsy to see if anyone will take the bait. If 
436 not, they patiently wait while the serious discussion resumes.
437 
438 When the fantasy folks dominate the screen it is quite 
439 different. Invariably some obnoxious boor starts calling      
440 people names, insulting their work, and demanding they move 
441 aside for serious discussion.
442 
443 What I find aggravating is that the fantasy people not only 
446 back down from these bullies but actually try to start a 
447 serious discussion to entertain them. I think we should have 
448 more self respect than that. 
449 
450 I have no use for bullies. I don't put up with them anywhere 
451 else and I see no reason to put up with them here.
452 
453 There is an accepted way to change the tone and direction   
454 what happens on this screen. If the bullies aren't smart  
455 enough to figure that out we needn't help them. If they act 
456 like fools they should be treated like fools.
457 
458 
459 If you're really hot for some serious discussion then go for 
460 it. But if you've merely been intimidated by 555 I ask that 
461 you don't try to turn the topic until you're doing it for 
462 yourself. 
463 
464 We don't need bullies on this system. The best way to keep   
465 them out is to ignor them.
466

475 MIG: I already left you the prefix! (magic number ring any bells?)
476 Voyeur: try Keith Laumer, esp. his book titled "BOLO"!
477 P.V. Jeltz: I have only met Mr Kare once. He is a well known "filk-singer" (no I
478 did NOT misspell that!). I believe he is currently living in California.
479 Valinor: I doubt that d would sic a dragon on anyone. She might cast a withering
480 glance your way however. (personally, I'd rather face the dragon than have d 
481 angry at me)
482 
483 Cmdr. Lacells:Quit threatening people! In this group we will ALWAYS have
484 someone who can outgun you. Also, just because a vehicle looks small & primitive
485 on the outside, it doesn't follow that it is harmless. The vehicle whose owner 
486 I'd least like to tangle with appears to be a simple wood and metal box, about
487 5 ft square & 7 ft tall. NO WAY do I want to tangle with the doctor!
488 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
489 The "AKKA" (if that was what it had been) disappeared. The bard turned 
490 to the piper, "Sorry, about that but the only thing that seems to stop his 
491 threats is to threaten him back."
492 He knelt contritely before looking at Dorothy, "Please forgive me for 
493 disrupting things, ma'am".

495 PS. To whoever thought I was Eric Ulinor.
496 No, but Giles DID get a bit too talkative once while we were out drinking......

506 Gary:
507      Bravo!
508 Mr. McKane:
509      I am not fooled by your aliases.  Your charges against me are blatant
510 fabrications.  I am an old gray-haired doctor, just trying to make ends
511 meet.  I must admit to being a friend of Mr. Wassir.  Gosh, what a nice
512 person.  Also how is the earmuff factory going?  Run out of small fuzzy
513 animals yet? <You rascal>
514 All:
515       As a subject of serious discussion, has anyone noted the goings on at
516 PMS recently.  It seems the Sysop there is trying to wring every penny out
517 of his users.  Take the case of poor Lane Hoffman.  His ads appear on most
518 of the BBS's.  They may be a little tiresome, but he should have a right to
519 try to make a buck.  But on PMS he gets charged for it.  Someone else placed
520 an ad there and on another BBS.  They get charged for a commercial transfer
521 fee (Whatever that is).  Now I have a feeling that the people who use the
522 system for free are either going to have their services cut or have to pay
523 to continue on the system.  I don't mind paying money for a quality service;
524 but I can't see paying for services available elsewhere for free.  If he needs
525 donations to keep his system working, I'd gladly contribute.  However, I think
526 he is just trying to make as much as he can from whoever he can.  No real
527 service provided.  Discussion?

531 GARY: YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE SEVERAL SEPARATE
532 'IDENTITIES'. I MYSELF HAVE ONE FOR THE FANTASY SIDE OF THINGS AND
533 ONE FOR MORE SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS. IT MAY BE THE ALTENATING USES
534 OF THESE THAT YOU ARE OBSERVING WITH ME AND OTHER PEOPLE ON THE BOARD.

537 ***************************************************************
538 Evan: I too have more than one "identity" (Grand Dragonmaster, 
539 LeRoy McKane, Monsieur d'Autun, Bill Broonzy, Natasha before 
540 her unfortunate demise) but I find no need to make spiteful 
541 comments about the contributions of others. I don't always get 
542 excited by others contributions. I'm sure others don't always 
543 get excited by mine. But I would never call anyone names  
544 because I didn't appreciate how they use this forum. 
545 
546 I seriously doubt that those who attack our rights to use our 
547 imaginations are engaged in fantasy. I believe they are 
548 outsiders who just drop by to raise a little hell. They are 
549 bullies, not contributors, and should be treated accordingly.

577 Dr. Frankenstupe et alii:
578   Regarding the PMS BBS, I cannot say anything about the charges for serv-
579 ices, having only logged on to it once.  However, I bethought myself that
580 a 5 minute time limit was a limit in more than just name.  Some of the
581 other serious boards (Bit Bucket, CBBS/NW, Beaverton RCP/M, whatever) are
582 a little more realistic.  I only recently got into this modeming stuff
583 (although by no means into computers), but that 5 minute time limit on
584 PMS definitely turned me off.  Granted, some people are piggish, and the
585 Sysops should rightfully pull the plug on them, but other boards seem to
586 be a little more realistic and generous.  They deserve the support.
587 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ GEEZER ++++++++++/+++++++
588 FOTI:
589    Yes, the gem is real. I didn't pick it up in his foyer, but in a back lab.
590 If you would recall earlier, the wizard was doing experiments on it.
591 ______
592 
593  Slowly I begin to come to. As the room comes into focus, Jonathon's
594 face starts to materialize. 
595 Aaaaaahhhhh! The blood is starting to circulate again. Wait, my stick shift
596 hand is still paralized. He must have forgot the mangoes. At least I'm partly
597 alive. 
598 As Jonathon walks orders another drink, I make a flash run to the door.
599 I've had enough of this. I don't know what this egg does, but I'll hide it unti
600 I figure out what to do. I'll have a messenger send a drink to the wizard while
601 I pour myself one. Maybe we can get together sometime.
