10 a few comments from the insurance records:
11 i thought the window was open. i found it was closed when i put my head through 
12 i pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law,
13 and drove over the embankment.
14 i had been driving for 40 years when i fell asleep at the wheel and had
15 the accident.
16 coming home, i drove into the wrong driveway and collided with a tree 
17 i don't have.
18 the other car collided with mine without giving any warning of his
19 intentions.
20 a pedistrian hit me and went under my car.
21 i collided with a stationary car coming the other way.
22 in my attempt to kill a fly, i drove into a telephone pole.
23 the telephone pole was approachig fast. i was attempting to swerve
24 out of its path when it struch my front end.
25 an invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my car, and disappeared.
26 the guy was all over the rod. i had to swerve a number of times before
27 i hit him.
28 there were plenty of lookers-on, but no witnesses.
29 
30 so, don't be surprised when they say they didn't see you.
31 
32 good luck, and beware

34 HELLO THERE, THIS IS YOUR SYSTEM OPERATOR SPEAKING....
35 AS YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED TO YOUR LEFT, THE 'B' DRIVE HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING
36 SOME DISK ERRORS. WHILE THERE IS NO REASON TO BE ALARMED, IT SHOULD BE
37 MENTIONED THAT THE DISK WAS OVER ONE YEAR OLD AND WAS IN CONTINUOS USE
38 THROUGHOUT THAT TIME PERIOD. IN FACT THE DISK THAT WAS IN DRIVE 'B'
39 WAS THE ORIGINAL DISK THAT THE BWMS SYSTEM WAS BROUGHT UP ON, AND HAS
40 BEEN IN USE EVER SINCE. (HOW'S THAT FOR A LONG PLAYING DISK...........
41 THAT WAS A PUN..  COME ON PEOPLE I KNOW YOUR OUT THERE, I CAN HEAR YOUR
42 MODEMS WISTLING.)
43 I MIGHT ALSO NOTE AT THIS TIME THAT NO BACKUPS ARE MADE OF THE DATA STORED
44 ON THE BWMS SYSTEM (WHICH IS WHY IT DISAPPEARS IN LARGE SECTIONS AT TIMES
45 BUT ON THE SAME TOKEN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO COMPLETELY DESTROY THE DATA
46 FROM THE USER STANDPOINT (IT IS RECOVERABLE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF WORK).
47 SO THERE IS NO REAL NEED TO DO SO. BESIDES ANYBODY THAT PUTS ANYTHING
48 OF ANY IMPORTANTS ON THIS SYSTEM IS PROBABLY STRANGER THAN THE REST OF THE 
49 USERS!!!!
50 ANYWAY, THE DEFECTIVE DISK HAS BEEN RETIRED FROM SERVICE, AND A BRAND SPANKING
51 NEW ONE IS NOW IN ITS PLACE (MEANING IT PROBABLY WON'T LAST A WEEK!).
52 SO HAVE A GOOD TIME AND ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT (OF FANTASY). CIST OP MIKEY

60 I must really be crazy to be up at 2:30 am using a box to

62 Anyway the above came from a newly brought up modem and it
63 seems to be working very well (PCS 103). My system is an

65 Does anyone have a 6502 program for modem transfer of data.
66 If so key the mesage with   "%MODEM%"    thank you.

94 Have you seen those clever Mutha Bell ads in the oRAGonian?  I called to
95 "LET'S TALK" at 800-555-5000.  I wound up in a conversation with a SYT here
96 in Portland.  She had a lot of answers that went "maybe it will be this way

98 afraid they won't be able to afford phone service after the Justice Dept.

100 to find out how I felt about my discussion and about the BS (Bell System) in

290 TO: ANALOG ALAN       FM: CISTOP MIKE      RE: STUFF AND SUCH
291     As to the ringer equivalance number, it tell the phone people what kind
292 of a load the device presents to the line. This can be either an AC type
293 load or a DC type load, or both. the number following the letter is how
294 much of a load with the standard bell in a telephone being equal to a load
295 of '1'.
296     As to the CPM system number, you already have it if you are reading this
297 The CPM system sits in behind BWMS and is accesable with a special pass word.
298 Access to the system is restricted as it is very easy to bring it down destroy
299 things, ect. As a result if you wish to use it you must be able to prove that
300 you are responsable enough to not purposly do that sort of thing, as well as
301 haveing a need to use the system. This is usally done by interview or
302 recomendation from an exsisting user. There does have to be a real need,
303 and not just a desire, since the system is very touchy as stated befor.
304 I am not trying to say that you are amoung the nasty sort, I am just stating
305 the requirements to get on (just the facts, only the facts!) I have to be
306 very carefull, as I have enough problems keeping BWMS clean without haveing
307 to wory about the CPM system too. (One easy way to find out if you quaulify
308 is if you have a pass word to Lyle's system since he is more restrictive
309 then I am this automaticlly gives you validity to access to my system, and
310 in fact the password sequence is often provided thru his system if no other
311 means is available to provide it with.)
312 Any more questions? I will be more then happy to try to answer them.
313 ****************************************************************************
314 To: Dragon Lady    Fm: Cistop Mike       Re: Female types not on system.
315     I agree with you that there is a great deficiency of persons of the 
316 feminine gender useing these facilities. (Or at least making themselves
317 known.) Indeed, I have often wondered why this is so, since it tends to
318 cause this and the other BBS's (which do not seem to be a whole lot better
319 off in this respect) to degenerate into the wholly masculine communicative
320 structures which can get rather monotonous at times. It is very refreshing
321 to observe the writings of another which does not have this structure and
322 provides a break from the often borishness of the usual talk on this system.
323     As such I beg of you to not forsake us and leave forever barren the 
324 video screens and printers of the users of this system of your marvelous
325 and wonderously communicative printed word.
326      The handle of Dragon Lady while not wholly uncommon has been used by
327 more then one, as such I know of several. However, there is always the 
328 possibility that I know of you if not directly, at least indirectly in one
329 way or another.
330 The question that comes to mind is NWSFS ? 
331     Ah, that I would be so lucky to be graced with such virtuosity on this
332 lowly BackWater Message System. Even so it is with great pleasure and

427 Dear Mike.  Thanks for your comments about the ringer equivalence.  I knew
428 about the ratio of load impedances, but never have seen anything that
429 explained the A and B suffix.  For instance, at work we have some 212 modems
430 that are ringer equiv 0.8A unless there is a 2565 phone attached - then
431 it is 1.4A.  Obviously the load is higher (more current) with the phone
432 hooked on, but why does the letter change?
433   I'm sure I don't have any pressing need to use your CP/M system, but
434 it's nice to know what people are talking about.

446 Yes it is necessary to notify the phone company if
447 you connect any foreign equipment to the phone
448 lines, such as a modem.
449 If you fail to notify them, and they find out about
450 it, they will send two burley servicemen to 
451 castrate you without anesthesia. If you have any
452 male children, the same will be done to them.
453 Why they pick on the males is unknown at the
454 present.
455 It is much easier to simply inform them of the
456 extra equipment. Besides, do you want to go
457 around for the rest of your like with a voice
458 that would get you into the Vienna Boys Choir?

462 are you sure you want to tell ma bell about your illegal
463 modem?
464 if it isn't approved by the fcc (to ma b's spec) it isn't 
465 legal to connect it anyway.
466 ========================================================================
467    yeah, mikey,
468      there is something that
469 could go,succh as the 'programmer's ten commandments'.
470 it's getting a little old, and does eat up a lot of space.

480 Ma Bell monitors this system with a wire
481 tap at 300 baud. Everything you say
482 can be held against you !
483 You with the modem, we know who you are
484 and we know where you live.
485 Bad karma awaits you !
