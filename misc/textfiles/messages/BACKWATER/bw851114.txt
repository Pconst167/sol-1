28 The Bear stood for a moment, reflecting on his dragon-kill. He stared at the
29 creature, and felt a touch of regret. Although it had a heart of pure evil,
30 it was something of a magnificent creature in its total devotion to destruct-
31 ion. But here it lay, it's side gutted open, the sticky red-black goo of blood
32 still dripping from the gashes.
33 
34 The Bear stood iin the blood, itit was fully an inch think around his feet as 
35 it slowly spread over the floor of the grotto. He pondered the egg in his hand
36 , it was still fairly small, he knew that it would have been several months
37 before it would have even been laid, and then several more before hatching.
38 
39 As the excitement of the battle and the thrill of victory began to wane, his
40 body began to feel the pain it had endured on this day. His skin was incred-
41 ibly tender to the touch, and it ached with a dull but strident pain from the 
42 repeated burnings it had endured.
43 
44 His muscles cried out for rest. His head spun. But he knew he couldn't lay
45 down here, for even as he stood in silence, the evil of the place was sapping
46 his strength even further. He looked up at the small hole in the wall above
47 him, where he had crawled out.  It seemed like eons ago now. But he had to 
48 leave this place, his senses and spirits were being attacked on all sides.
49 
50 The aroma from the dragon's body was all-encompasing, and worse than anyone
51 who has never smelled the inside of a dragon can imagine. The sight was
52 grisly. Hissing sounds could be heard from the dragon's corpse as the hot
53 steam from it's inner breath dripping down over the blood. And the evil 
54 surrounded Bear, and took away his will.
55 
56 He looked again at the hole in the wall. There were just enough crags in the 
57 rock where he could get foot and hand holds. He sheathed his sword, tucked
58 the egg in his shirt, and started to climb. His muscles cried for him to
59 stop, and his head swam with the effort, but he took it slowly, lifting him
60 self up and then grabbing another rock, until he could finally reach his 
61 fingers over the ledge. He finally lifted himself up, and plopped on the firm
62 ground.
63 
64 The evil was less here, but still he crawled down the tunnel, until he cou:d
65 breathe slightly fresher air. And he laid down, his mind turning into a deep
66 fog of unconsciousness.
67 
68 But not before he thought of the Toll-takers, and the quest they had sent him
69 on. A quest they knew he would never come back from alive.
70 
71 As his mind faded away, he also thought of his Ladyship, and the larger
72 quest she had commissioned him for. He had not expected such battles, but he
73 knew he must not fail...

81 (Part 4)
82         
83      A week I stayed there, long enough for Jen's grief to fade into a dark melancholy that would only pass with time,
84 if ever. Her smile was tinged with a trace of sadness that would probably last for a long, long while. Our spirits
85 seemed to be recovering together, though, and a kind of bond was forming between us, a bond that never would have
86 existed while Roy was alive. I felt that it was friendship, strengthened by mutual grief, but I knew it was starting to
87 run deeper than that. After a week my apartment seemed very cold and small and lonely.
88      Over the next couple weeks I ran up the most horible phone bill, calling Portland to Vancouver. My gas bill ran
89 just as high, and it helped a little when they reopened 205. I still felt a little sick every time I crossed the
90 bridge.
91      Jen and I went out almost every night. Dinners and movies and shows and all sorts of good stuff like that.
92 Sometimes we just stayed home and talked. Put two CBers together without a microphone in the room and just TRY to shut
93 them up. It's impossible.
94      At first I refused to acknowledge my feelings, but after a while they grew so strong I had to. Being a total loser
95 with women, I had had very little personal contact with them. Almost to the point where I was a little scared of them.
96 Jen was different, though. I had known her for better than a year and was very comfortable with her. Often I had seen
97 her at Roy's side and thought "If only..." but, of course, she was safely out of reach, so I could write off any
98 possibilties and tell myself I was better off for it. Now, Roy was permanently out of the picture and while I was sorry
99 as hell, life must go on. I was falling in love. But I was scared to say anything about it. I feared that if I did, she
100 would not see me as the same person and the tensions generated would destroy out friendship. It had happened
101 before.
102      It never occurred to me that Jen might have felt the same way. In the end, she took the initiative. Late one
103 night, at my apartment, we sat on the couch just talking. Out of nowhere, she said that she had admired me from afar,
104 and while she loved Roy with all her heart, she still had always felt something special for me. With a dry mouth I
105 tried to stutter out a reply but nothing really witty came to mind. She went on to say that I had done so much for her
106 lately and I was such a wonderful person and any reply I might have had was stopped by her mouth meeting
107 mine.
108      Surprised, I fell back on the couch with her on top of me. Next thing I knew she was all over me. Her living,
109 breathing weight on my chest and stomach was electrifying. The kiss lasted what felt like an incredibly long time. I
110 put my arms around her and our bodies seemed to fuse into one. When we finally broke her breathing was quick, agitated.
111 The sweet pressure of her hips grinding against mine precluded the need for any further talk.
112      We made love right there on that ratty old couch that I had picked up at a garage sale for ten bucks two years
113 ago. After it was over we lay together, sweaty and exhausted. For the first time a deep hole in my life had been filled
114 and I felt like a complete person. It was a far more wonderful feeling than I had imagined it would be. All the old
115 hurts and pains had dissappeared. For the first time the future looked bright and beautiful. I thought it would last
116 forever.
117      I only wish it had.
118

125    Damn if it didn't look like a buck. Whatever it was, it had a magnificent set of antlers. Must be another case of
126 parallel evolution. James had discovered that there was a lot of it going around in the universe. The animal was
127 grazing about six hundred yards away and he just barely had a clear shot at it through the brush. He raised his
128 sword.
129    Tariya was about to ask him what the hell he was doing when he put a hand over her mouth and whispered that he
130 would brain her if she scared THIS one off. The mood he was in, he would have done it, too.
131    He held the sword straight out in front of him and sighted along the blade. His body jerked slightly and a hot blue
132 spark lept from the tip of the blade. It writhed and twisted in its course but hit the target dead on. The animal fell
133 over like a truck had hit it. The air now stank of ozone. James took off through the brush, not checking to see it
134 Tariya could follow. She managed to keep up and was right behind him when he reached the animal. She looked down at it
135 sadly.
136    James stripped off his jacket so as not to get it bloody. The blade suddenly shrank to a length of about eight
137 inches. Just right for skinning. He plunged it into the deer's belly and opened it up. Tariya turned a nice shade of
138 green and gagged. She decided to wait for him back on the path. He grinned as he heard her make her way through the
139 brush. He could be a vindictive bastard, and knew it, too.
140    After a lot of screwing up and cursing he managed about twenty or so pounds of meat, which he wrapped up in a
141 section of hide he had cut off. He felt bad about leaving all that meat to rot but since he had no way to preserve it
142 it would all go bad in a couple of days, anyway. He very rarely had to rough it like this and knew next to nothing
143 about wilderness survival, anyway. Besides, he doubted the corpse would remain unnoticed long. Some carnivore would
144 get a free lunch. He made his way back to the path.
145    James had still managed to get pretty messy and he washed up in a nearby stream while Tariya gathered some wood. He
146 only spoke to her in short, sharp sentences and generally made it clear he was still mad. She was just as mad, but no
147 longer quite as certain of her reasons.
148    Another spark off the sword started he fire. Who needed matches? James cooked the meat and tried it first,
149 reasoning that if it was poisonous to them he would stand a much better chance of surviving. Charcoaled on the outside
150 and half raw inside (a cook he wasn't) it still tasted surprisingly good. Not poisonous, either, or he would have
151 found out real quick. Tariya took her share but didn't seem too hungry, though whether from the food itself or because
152 she was still mad he couldn't tell.
153    Later they were back on the path again. If they didn't find any habitation by nightfall, James decided, they would
154 be leaving in the morning. It was a nice enough place to visit, he supposed, but he had things to do. The slight risk
155 posed by extending himself now would be balanced by the time he saved not waiting. Waiting for anything was not
156 advisable at this point.
157    The first sun was once again low on the horizon, making it a full local day they had been here. James lagged behind
158 Tariya, watching carefully for signs of something besides trees. Suddenly a glint of metal in the grass caught his
159 eye. He knelt down to examine it as Tariya disappeared around a curve ahead, not noticing he had stopped.
160    It was a broken knife handle, adorned with intricate carvings and strange lettering. He tried to decipher the
161 lettering but couldn't get more than a vague impression of something considerably less than benign.
162    He was still puzzling over the object when the woods echoed with a bone-chilling scream.

167 a lonely beach.  Will wonders never cease?

179 That's all we need, a long talk about AIDS and VD and herpes and then two
180 people having sex on a couch. Some have short memories, but this? As long
181 as we continue to glorify sex without wedlock impressionable people will
182 continue to think it is fine and dandy to partake of such pleasures. It
183 is a sad day when the search for moral fortitude comes up empty handed.

197 Pen Name: I feel reluctant to continue this conversation what with your snide sarcasm and the condescending tone ("that
198 you even know a shread about the level of biology needed to comprehend what I say") you seem to feel makes you sound so 
199 intelligent. I assure you I know much more about evolution than you obviously suppose. I also happen to know a great 
200 deal about Catholicism. You see, I was raised Catholic, and even attended a Catholic school. At the end of that teaching
201 I found myself rejecting the church completely, and thereby God's existence as well. After a short time of assuming that
202 since their teachings were wrong, all must be wrong, I delved into the subject of creation, evolution and religion to 
203 learn the truth. I set aside my bitterness, which like you, I had plenty of, and looked at it with clear eyes, hearing 
204 all arguments. The Catholic faith is full of wrongs, and dangerous ones at that.
205 I had a sneaking suspicion that you had endured some bitter childhood religious experiences, and you proved me right
206 before I could ask. And I don't blame you for still being so. But it's time to
207 start fresh and *set those teachings completely aside*. It's very hard to do, and again, I don't blame you for taking 
208 the easy way out.
209 
210 But your bitterness turns you into a much-less-than-skillful debator. Using such tactics as steering clear of the
211 original question (prove evolution) and instead attacking the other side of
212 the question and *then* the questioner as well indicates a rigid, self-important, tyronistic and self-important 
213 (oops already said that- didn't mean to emphasize the point to harshly.) Any, close-minded attitude.
214 
215 If you would like to take this discussion to another BBS where we could leave personal messages, great. I'm all for it,
216 for some odd reason. The challenge of at least seeing you listen I guess. But to bore the other patrons of this 
217 wonderful board with your harsh and probably extended (never to the  point! No, the more arguments, the wider their 
218 path, the better, so as poor as they may be, they are irrefutible simply by the magnitude of their numbers!) discert-
219 ations on a subject you are obviously no expert on is not fair to those who are tired of their rehashing on public
220 boards.
221 
222 I don't expect you to go sulking away. I would expect you to get angry, as you apparently have. Your inner bitterness
223 at your erroneous religious upbringing is quick to rise to the fore. I also never said I'd 'save' you. In fact I said
224 just the opposite. It's certainly not to be my job (I hope), so don't put words in my mouth.
225 
226 Anyway, again, best regards, best wishes, I still feel sorry for you even if you don't want me to, and my offer of
227 continued discussion still stands...

234 Mohammed - Loved your Valinor entry. Excel
235 Unfortunately it's unlikely LeRoy will come out of retirement
236 any time soon. Life has been to chaotic. Work too stressful.
237 
238 I thought raising Natasha from the dead was a nice touch. I 
239 thought it fit nicely with all the religious discussion. After
240 all, her brother LeRoy was famous spiritual leader. 
241 
242 Being a caseworker for Children's Services Divisio
243 totally bizarre experience. It is extremely stressful. Extremely
244 difficult. And the most interesting work I've ever done.
245 
246 I'm seeing the world from an entirely different perspective.
247 Sometimes it's enough to make you sick but it's always 
248 fascinating. 
249 
250 French Toast - Yes...I know I'm sliping. Alot of it is this
251 hideous Enter Only. I hate it. In the old days I'd wait it out.
252 I can't do that anymore. I grab my telecomputing time when I
253 can get it. And that means Enter Only. Enter Only means I can't
254 do my final editing.
255 
256 FYI - I think it's terrible the way Frank treated you. I think
257 you should give him hell.
258 
259 You've got to be careful with Frank. He's got a sharp tounge 
260 and easily lashes out. The thing to remember is that he's not
261 real. Don't take offense.
262 
263 I noticed you used two signatures (FYI & F.Y.I.) and two line
264 lengths. Does that mean that you're more than one character?
265 What name, or names, might I know you by?
266 
267 I greatly enjoyed both of your entries. They were surprisingly
268 insightful and I found them refreshing. You obviously watch this
269 board carefully.
270 
271 John Silverman - You are a very good writer. I have been 
272 impressed with your talent. With experience I think you could
273 be a top notch writer.
274 
275 Have you ever considered experimenting with writing styles 
276 other than narrative? I love it when the really good writers
277 play around with different styles and formats.
278 
279 I feel that it breathes life into the Inn.
280 
281 To All - Backwater has been really interesting lately. I think
282 the quality of the writing is on the upswing. I only wish I had
283 the time to really participate.

319 Just an observation, it seems like a lot of the arguments of late are based 
320 on how agressive and overpowering each individual can be. Demanding that the
321 other individual is not playing the game fairly. + fred + and _ French Toast _
322 are doing it to each other, as are | PEN NAME | and [ Andy ].
323 It seems so often that debates around here end up as a emotionally based
324 argument on the individuals own beliefs and view points. Demanding that
325 the other individuals beliefs are not acceptable nor proper. That there
326 is only one true way to see things, and that any other is false. While
327 that may be true for you personally, it is not true for everyone. 
328 Everyones view of the world is different, and you should not expect and
329 particularly you should not demand that other people see things the way 
330 that you see them. Nor does it mean that the other persons veiwpoint is
331 wrong. Learn a little tolerance, and you'll get a lot further in the world.
332 Nuff said, not that anybody will listen to me. When it comes to emotions
333 and beliefs nobody wants to admit that they aren't being reasonable.

336 Ah heck, a good discussion and rapid-fire words doesn't always have to result 
337 someone saying "now calm down boys," etc. Everyone has a right to their opinion,
338 and brisk discussions are certainly more worthwhile and get the blood flowing
339 than miserly chit-chat. Not that I condone name-calling, but lively discussions,
340 which obviously contain emotions, are not always so bad. They keep life inter-

351 [*=*] They had walked for more than an hour, leisurly now that they were safely away from the pizza place, away from

366 where people rise from the grave and live until their 'birth'.  time essentially
367 flows backwards there.  in a sense, she's growing younger here in our plane,
368 although we see her growing 'older'.
369     "from what she's told me, she was exiled for political reasons.  some big
370 misunderstanding between herself, her husband and the former king of her land,
371 whose name was nosaj.  oh, i'm sorry, that's her husband's name.  the king's 
372 name was noerc."
373     At that point, Tayree saw the piper laying in the hall clutching his
374 wrist.  It was bleeding quite heavily again, and he looked quite pale.
375     "emu, cragmore," she called, "help me get piper into the stateroom."  Once
376 there, she and Emu set to work bandaging Piper's wound.
377     Cragmore looked at Trainor, sleeping against the bulkhead.  "Bard, let's
378 get Trainor into his own room.  Aedem, could you help us?  Thanks.  Yes, just
379 inside this room, up onto the bed.  What was that, Bard?"  Bard was mumbling
380 to himself, with a puzzled look on his face.
381     "Huh?  Oh, just uh, just thinking to myself.  Let's leave Trainor alone
382 here, and Aedem, why don't you see if Emu and Tayree need any help with
383 Piper's arm."  She nodded and as they left the room, Bard motioned for Cragmore
384 to follow him.
385 
386     "Okay, I'll bite.  What's up, Bard?"
387     Bard closed the hatchway into the control room, and made sure that all the
388 communication circuts were inactive.  Only after making sure that they wouldn't be overheard did Bard answer.
389     "Cragmore, did you catch anything interesting about this Aedem woman?"
390 At the mentalist's look of confusion, Bard continued.  "What do you know
391 of Earth's Greek mythology?"

395 PEN NAME; THANKS FOR THE HELLO!! 
396        GOT ONE HERE THAT I BEEN WORKING ON!
397 
398 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~THE COUSIN~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
399  
400    They  came to the river,young,rich,adventurous and  desirous 
401 of seeing the magnificence of the gourge. He found it all that he 
402 hoped,  its water,  its sun,  feasts, - and the beauty of its 
403 man.  He  took quarters in the aristocratic old house boat  and 
404 there , one day, was talking with some of his new River friends.
405      He  had just done complimenting the women of their morrage   
406 when Tommaso spoke up,saying,  "ah,  but you have not seen 
407   most superb beauty of all,  our legend,  our famous lady  of 
408 ystery,  whom  every man praises but whom almost none  has  ever 
409 seen."
410  Pressed for a further account,  Tommaso continued,  "she  is 
411 e wife of a  well-to-do master sail maker. Two years ago, there 
412 was a rumor that the bigest longshoremen here was so inflamed  by 
413  one  glimpse  of her that he swore he would put her  to  the 
414 oof.  And there have been other tales.  Still, though there are 
415 servants  in his home ,  none will admit to having seen  her,  I 
416 have  been to his shop often,  and often have I seen him  at  the 
417 er or the city --always in the company of his cousin, a young 
418 n who stidies law at the university, but never with a wife."
419      LaBones  asked  to  be taken to the sail  makers  shop  and 
420 roduced to Him.  Having arrived, Tommaso made the introduction 
421 nd  excused himself for other business while LaBones sat down to 
422 order a set of sails.
423     As  the  sailmaker  bent  over  some  measurements,  LaBones 
424 glanced  around  the shop and was astonished to see  a  beautiful 
425 ng woman spying on him from the back of the gallery.  She had 
426 e fairest face,  the reddest lips and the most enchanting  eyes 
427 he  had  ever beheld.  So struck with love was he that he  almost 
428 cried out. Then she was gone.
429   A little latter,  a young man came down the stairs from  the 
430 allery,   The  sailmaster  looking  round  at  him,  said,  "ah, 
431 n,"as  he ushered LaBones to the door.  But the face of  the 
432 ng man was the face LaBones had seen in back.
433     LaBones went at once to meet Tommaso and the two had a very 
434 long talk, at the end of which they made a plan.

443     First a 'Loc'.
444     John Silverman may be a techniquely competant, perhaps even excelant
445 writer.  I certainly make no claim to such ability let alone greater, yet
446 neather his style nor subject matter holds my interest.  Perhaps its a matter
447 of personal taste.  Just as some people care little for open verse poetry, I
448 find neither delight nor enlightenment in mundane mainstream prose.
449     (By all means keep writing it though; a lot of other people appearently do)
450 *=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
451     "Zypher: if you look above your head, floating just below the table's top
452 you will see what appears to be a translucent green sausage.  This is person.
453      On another world there were many brothers in spirit to yourself.  person
454 figured in several of thair adventures.  Perhaps you have encountered such a
455 one in such dreams as are usualy forgotten upon waiking.  He speaks only in 
456 the mind lacking organs of speach.  Also I use he in the sense of generic 
457 sentient, person lacks any recognisable biomorphic polarity (a term I picked
458 up from Themnax ).  It was person's voice spoke last time"
459     As Dreamtoucher said this the green sausage shape bent slightly in the
460 middly, 'forward' end bobbing up and down slightly.  Snowrunner mearly lowered
461 her chin further on her forelegs and sighed.
462     "These are streinge times indeed for a simple elf who loves to run free in
463 the woods.  Among humans I've been something called employed lately.  An odd
464 experience, not without benefit but benifits not without cost.  One of the 
465 costs is some prescence of mind."

467      An extension to my 'Loc' at the start of my entry above:  Both Rebalsa
468 and Destroyer (in his current encarnation) are absolutly delightful.  Bear is
469 at tymes 'unBEARable' but perhaps learning by doing.  As to non-story 
470 commentaries, I will perhaps run off at the keyboard at greater length some 
471 future tyme.

474 Having read through three hundred lines (entered since thid morning, Urgh!)
475 lets see if I can get it straight the first time:
476 Grand D.: First, is it really you? If so, then you are a person who has the 
477 respect of a lot of the tenants of this inn (Which they don't give easily) and
478 therefore I am flattered by your comments. Pardon my skepticism about your 
479 identity, but still being a relaitive (6 months) newcomer here, I still have to
480 take everything I see at face value, which is made doubly hard by all the 
481 fakery and border stealing going on lately.
482 Second, you mentioned styles other that straight narrative. I like narrative
483 because I enjoy reading it, becuase I can do it somewhat well, but mostly because
484 it's the only style I know. I don't know what you mean by "other styles", honestly
485 I do like to experiment, though, so if I had some idea what "other styles" meant,
486 then maybe I could try.
487 Finally, are you the one who informed me about Frank? Or was that someone else
488 stealing your border? If that was you, then thank you for the info. It was 
489 driving me nutz.
490 Dreamtoucher: So prose puts you to sleep, while poetry puts me to sleep. I can
491 handle that. Thanks anyway. See you around.
492 Time to prepare another upload. I'll probably need it tomorrow (sigh)...

509   The piper watched the group with slightly glassy eyes.  The speed with whitch
510 events were changing had him somewhat bewildered.  The sight of the young woman
511 with whom he had been in such violent and intimate contact, whose fate was
512 heavy upon his mind, seemed almost to be a dream vision.  Worry surged up,
513 he attempted to rise.  She was injured!  She shouldn't be...
514   The hands of the others interrupted his revery.  As the lady in the grey
515 cloak moved out of sight, helping with the unconcious Trainor, the piper
516 was almost unconcious of the strong hands helping him.  While his body might
517 be fully engaged in getting the reopened wound sutured, his heart was
518 wandering the corridors of the machine, following a young woman dressed
519 in a soft grey robe.

529 For anyone even mildly interested, Pen Name and I (Andy) had quite a chat (letting
530 our fingers do the walking), saving about 59 weeks of back and forth on a BBS like
531 this as well as your boredom to sift through it. And while he couldn't provide any
532 arguments proving evolution, neither could I disproving it. The end result was an
533 agreement to disagree as well as a realization that it's much easier to shout
534 and curse when communications are slow in coming. Direct talking has quite a
535 number of distinct advantages. Perhaps Reagan might realize this?
536 
537 On second thought... perhaps not.

542 Dreamtoucher 'Loc':
543 I am interested in constructive criticsm and appreciate the fact that you
544 speak up. Writers who take offense at honest opinions should keep their 
545 writing to themselves. That's why I would enjoy hearing you elaborate on why
546 my stories are unBEARable at times (other than the fact that they feature
547 graphic killing- the point there being that killing and destruction etc. are
548 certainly not pretty things to see...). Anyway, your continued response would 
549 be appreciated since I'm only trying to provide interesting, and somewhat
550 different, materia.
551 Thanks

556 Any other opinions?
557 00000000000000
558 Grand D: Oh yes, you do know me from BW quite well. We have spoken many times under different circumstances, and we
559 have even been on opposite sides of the net, so to speak. When I saw the incarnation of Frank being trod upon by
560 neophytes, I was forced to speak up. I did not know whether Frank would ever return, and I felp compelled to set
561 the record straight. I am not big on being a brother's keeper, but when the brother might be blind, deaf, and
562 mute, I had to act. Frank was such a wonderful invention, not because of the response he gathered from the good
563 users of BW, and not because of his particular interests, but because through his characterization he allowed all of
564 us a glance into our own pyches. If we were able to see beyond the red haze of anger before our eyes, and comprehend
565 what Frank was really all about,  we grew, and in doing so received more from Frank than we would like to admit. It
566 was an experiment worthy of great praise, and I commend its creator. The logistics were perfectly planned, and I don't
567 think Frank slipped up once in all the messages he left. FYI (or F.Y.I.) was merely a character constructed to help
568 set the record straight, and hopefully cause Frank and/or Frank's creator to return. FYI distorted history a bit, but
569 only in the hopes of Frank/Creator noticing the distortions and in turn coming back and telling his own story. It is
570 difficult to know when someone lurks if they don't leave even a trace! Anyway, my job is complete. My creator will no
571 doubt meet you in other personnas and on other battle fields, be they Oklahoma City, Oriental Torture rooms, or the
572 front row of the Mormon Tabernacle.

580 Cragmore sat down slowly on a nearby cushioned bench. His face was the face of
581 deep concentration. The thumb and index finger of his right hand rose and
582 snapped, as Cragmore tried to remember. Slowly his memory returned. His powers
583 quickly fashioned traces into concepts, concepts into visions, and visions
584 into pure memory; memory that could be relived and spoken of.
585      "I am not sure, but Aedon was the wife of Zethus, the king of Thebes,
586 and mother of Itylus. She was insane with jealousy over her sister-in-law
587 Niobe, who had six sons and six daughters. She tried to kill the eldest son
588 of her sister-in-law, but instead killed her own son Itylus. Zeus changed
589 her into a nightingale to forever sing her plaintive song. The only other
590 thing I can think of is the Aedes mosquito which transmitted dengue and
591 yellow fever. I must have failed because I can not relate either of these to
592 our own situation. What exactly do you mean? And why all the secrecy from
593 the others?"
