29      Cold and alone, the stark figure stood in the emptied room.
30 The eyes that looked nowhere yet saw everything were still pointing
31 straight off into infinity.  It's hand drew from under it's khaki
32 gown and was held open, there was nothing in it.  Slowly the fingers
33 began to close, as did it's eyes.  Once the hand was clenched into
34 a tight fist, it said,
35      "In eight more days the moon will be new, in thirty-six his
36 time will have come to an end.  Third Sister, your time is near at
37 hand..."  Once these words had been spoken, grains began
38 to fall from the closed hand and began to disappear, as did the 
39 familiar figure...

43    "Okay, Grann, it's your show," Milchar said, his words clashing strongly
44 with the medieval landscape surrounding him.  Spell books were in hand, 3 x 5
45 cards at the ready- all was prepared for the long journey ahead of the mage
46 and his gnomish pupil.  Grann was to begin the journey, casting a spell to
47 transport both of them to their first destination.
48    "Nuroc defbos alatmain, gyco rewnamais tydisain!" Grann half-chanted, half-
49 shouted.  He'd not advanced as far as to be capable of casting the dweomer
50 without such verbal crutches, but Milchar was proud of him being able to do
51 this particular one at all.  Other-planal spells could be so bloody tricky.
52    A short "pop" echoed into the forest in Celene; air rushed into the gap 
53 where Milchar and Grann had been standing only moments before.
54    Simultaneously, they appeared in a dusty, white, and obviously disused
55 corridor.  A faint hum from the surrounding walls told of technology nearby.
56    Both of the travellers were taken slightly aback.  They'd expected a verdant
57 field, lined with thatched huts.
58 Grann's small face reddened slightly as he tried for a few moments to look for
59 the non-existant huts.
60    Milchar observed this, amused and irritated at the same time.  This detour
61 would cost them precious time as they tried to discover their location, and
62 prepared for another try.  All spells had their limits, in one way or another:
63 the one Grann had used was limited by time.  It could only be used once every
64 few days.  Milchar decided to make the best of it, and began looking at a
65 nearby panel for a clue.  Grann saw this, and followed suit.
66    A few moments searching uncovered a small plate riveted to a service panel.
67 The dust covered it thickly; Milchar began rubbing it off.  "T...A...R...D..."
68 he began, then stopped.  "No, it couldn't be.  That would be asking too much
69 of coincedence," he muttered.  Grann padded over, now watching him work from
70 behind.  Milchar continued working, more slowly this time.  "...I...S.  A...C..
71 C...E...S...S...," and so on, until the entire plate had been cleaned.  It
72 read, "TARDIS ACCESS HATCH #63492".
73    Coincedence had decided that "too much" be damned, Grann's faulty spell had
74 carried them somewhere into the bowels of the Doctor's TARDIS.  He wasn't going
75 to like this.
76    As if he were a telepath, the Doctor's voice floated into the hall on cue
77 from hidden speakers.  "You and your 3 x 5 cards.  I think the spell
78 you used to get here put me off course by three parsecs and ten years.  Come
79 on up to the control room, let's have a look at you.  A service vehicle on the
80 way, just get on.  It's only a ten-minute ride from where you are.  Oh, by the
81 way- glad to see you again, Milch."

88 The world I built with you love,
89 And the world you built with me,
90 Is crumbling down, now that you've gone
91 To join other such debris.
92 
93 I can't afford to linger
94 Within its memory.
95 For one can't frolic alone for two,
96 So lovely and silently.
97 
98 For the one does struggle for laughter
99 Which the two so lightly breezed.
100 And the tears that do come after,
101 Share no harmony.
102 Fall alone while they relieve.
103 
104 But although our world is over
105 And another one will spring,
106 Perhaps with another lover;
107 Some things solidly remain.
108 
109 The little ways of walking,
110 And the little ways to joke.
111 And the little styles of thinking,
112 And the similar dreams for both;
113 Will never fade away.

118   {NEW POET}, I was talking to another visiter here just the other night.  One
119 of those long late night conversations that drift into the morning hours, one
120 filled with long pauses and a hundred subjects.  One of the subjects was how
121 uncomfortable it is to praise our fellow users here on BW.  We both admitted to
122 calling in soon after we posted our work, to see if it had made any impression,
123 like children seeking recognition of some new accomplishment.  Yet we ourselves
124 withheld our views.  Your name came up, and we both agreed that we had wanted
125 to tell you how much we liked your work, but we hadn't.
126   I just wanted you to know.

135      The cab ride was a little longer than I had anticipated and had
136 commited the unforgivable act of falling asleep in the back seat.  Yet 
137 the soft feel of the geltely worn cusion begged for me to sleep.  As I
138 had passed though many neighborhoods and had missed many sights, there
139 was but one person I had struggled to see.  If the gods were with me,
140 I would soon have my wish.
141      "Awright Mac, this is the end of the ride.  You can wake up now."
142 The voice of the cabby was not a pleasant one to wake up to, but it 
143 was all I needed to be brought back to my sences.  Slightly dazed for
144 having allowed myself to slip into the comfort of sleep, I had pulled
145 my head back into the upright position with enough force to give myself
146 a horrible crick.  I'll live.
147      "Thank you, my good man...  Are you quite certain that this is the
148 address of the lady I had given you?"  I asked, trying too much to be
149 casual.
150      "Listen Mac, I been drivin' through these streets for the past
151 thirteen years so I should know one house from another after all this 
152 time, don't you think?"  He didn't sound very well at odds so I would
153 just pay him and be off.
154      "Yes, and very well at that.  Thank you for your services."  With
155 that I handed the man a fistful of currency and left him behind me.
156      As the drowsiness cleared from my sight, the old mansion became
157 quite clear--large and majestic.  It had been much too long since I had
158 seen the 'palace' that I had forgotten of its splendor.  Looking at it 
159 would remind one of the great houses of the old South before the fires of
160 battle would leave their hideous reminders.  This was The Lamb Manor.
161      Cautiously, I walked closer to it.  The hedges and barred iron 
162 fences showed that she still cared for her privacy.  They would not stop 
163 me for a moment.  Maintaing a vigil for anyone that might bear a 
164 resemblance to a security man, I made my way around to a portion of the
165 fence that was in desperate need of repair.  Due to the fact that someone
166 had been neglecting their job, mine had been made all the more easier.
167 Besides, I hadn't really felt like scaling the fence as it was.
168 Once on the grounds and away form the greenery I shaked off the twigs and
169 leaves that would be tell tale of my compromise of their precious
170 security routine.  I made myself comfortable with the fact that if I had
171 not been accosted yet, I wouldn't be stopped.  I walked up to the main
172 entrance and took another look around before lifting the brass knocker.
173 The gate that stood directly behind me was standing wide open.  Smooth.
174 Now that I felt like a complete fool, I had to forget the whole farce.
175 After dropping the knocker, I ran my hand through my hair and straighted
176 my blouse and jacket.  The thought that I looked like a beggar did not
177 rest well on my conscience.
178      "Yes, suh.  What is it that you require?" came the voice from the
179 opened door.  The sight of the butler wearing a tuxedo gave my ego a dent.
180      "I would like to see the lady of the house...  If I may."
181      "Might she be expecting your company, suh?"  I wasn't sure which I
182 loathed more, his overly strong British accent or his looking down his
183 nose at me.
184      "No, although the appointment I have with her is...                          long overdue."
185      "M'lady is rather occupied today.  May I inform her who wishes to
186 see her?"  Again, that annoying accent.
187      "Yes, if you would be so kind," I said with great sarcasm and a smile
188 on my face.  "Inform her that Kos...  That a Mister Coolidge wishes to
189 see her."
190      "Yes, suh.  I'll return to you shortly.  Please wait outside."  He
191 then turned to attend to my request.  From behind, he was vulnerable.  As
192 he dropped to the floor, he was unconscious.
193      "Goodnight, Winston.  I think I am quite capable of handling my own
194 affairs, thank you."  I shook my hand to relieve the sting it received from
195 delivering the blow.  Finding her office within the house would not be
196 difficult for now being on the inside my memory of the house improved
197 greatly.  Once upstairs and at the door I listened for sounds that would
198 indicate whether anyone was inside.  A minute passed and I heard nothing
199 that told of someones presence.  I slowly turned the knob of the door.
200      "I thought I told you that I wasn't to be disturbed, Phillip."
201 Her voice was soft yet upset, she didn't raise her head from her desk.
202      "Yes, mum.  Is there anything else?"  I said with the strongest accent
203 I could muster while the door closed behind me.
204      "Phillip?"  She raised her eyes to look at the intruder, they were 
205 quizzical and filled with wonder.  She only gasped.
206      "Did you  think that I would not return to you someday?"  I aksed.
207 She paused before she dropped her eyes back to her papers.
208      "You!  I had waited for you.  For months and months I waited!  Then
209 I just...  gave...  up..."  She slumped in her chair as she fell back in
210 confussion.  It appeared that the time that was spent in our seperation
211 had all just caught up with her.
212      "I had wanted to tell you that I was going to leave, but I could not.
213 There was a reason for my silence, for my absence."  I stopped to catch
214 my breath.  "There was a reason..."  The words were difficult to speak.
215      "But you just left!   And for what?  So you could be with your
216 friends at that fancy computer corporation?"  Some vitality returned to
217 her as she spat out the words with a degree of contempt.  "You never
218 could make time for me once you joined up with that 'Nebula Electronics
219 Training' group.  No, you just had to study... You just had to stay away
220 from me once you made your new friends over there, you rat!"  She had 
221 risen from her chair and was coming at me with a bared hand in an attempt
222 to slap me.  I kept her hand from reaching my face by intercepting it with
223 mine.  She became furious when her attempt failed and raised her other 
224 hand to do the job.  I never cared for having to handle a lady in such a
225 manner, but I wasn't about to stand there and be slapped by a frenzied 
226 woman.  I grabbed both of her arms to halt her and backed her to her desk
227 to settle her.
228      "You must listen to me, I don't have much time.  Sooner or later they
229 will be after me, they always are."
230      "What are you talking about Lewis?"
231      "Again that name!  I am no longer 'Lewis', never call me by that name
232 again.  You will only call me 'Kosta' for it is what I am rihtly called 
233 by.  Now listen to me."
234      "Kosta?  What's wrong with you?  You'r not..."  Just then the sound
235 of the telephone's intercom filled the room.
236      "(Zzzt)  Your attourney is here to finalize your divorce actions,
237 would you like for me to send him in now?"
238      "Mary...  Divorce?  You've married?  But I..."
239      "Twice, you fool.  This is in all the California papers.  Where have 
240 you hiding all this time?  Russia?"  I was truly statled.
241      "No, Bulgaria...."  was the only thing that came to mind.
242 It was the truth, but she never would believe me.  Could I believe her?
243 .............       .............       .............       .............
244 Now that I've taken more than enough space with my babbling, I depart.
245 Have at it if you wish, I attempted to make up for lost time but all I
246 ended with was digression.  'Tis my reward for disregard for deadlines.

250   As nearly imperceptable echoes of the gray dawn filtered down into the depths
251 of the forest floor, the piper's mind began to clear.  He was striding slilently
252 through the darkness, guided by silently moving grey forms like disembodied
253 spirits that appeared out of the darkness, corrected his course, and slipped
254 off into the shadows.  Somehow they kept him in motion -- the non-verbal message
255 was present and clear -- "hurry! move silently and swiftly.  we must be gone."
256   The piper realized that he was being moved at the maximum pace he could
257 long sustain -- green eyes materialized over a long muzzle, gazed for a moment
258 and faded -- pressed along with no room for manuever.  Suddenly, a gentle touch,
259 and a tug, the piper found his course altered.  The piper felt that the
260 controlled force in the jaws that held his wrist could easily crush the bones,
261 but the touch was light and controlled.  Turned from the track by this signal,
262 the piper stood quietly, looking at his compainion, a large wolf standing with
263 a most intellegent look in it's eyes.

271       Slowly I breath life into the feable spark.
272                It flares, catches flame.
273 The dark winds howl their anger at this intuding fire,
274          But my desperate resolve is stronger.
275               I cannot, I will not fail.
276   As I carefully shield the small flame with my body, 
277    I light the small fire in branches of dead trees,
278            and quickly it flares into life.
279     Though the darkness screams its rage in anger,
280             I hold fast to my firm resolve,
281                and the flame yet lives.
282      I dare not let even tears of happiness fall, 
283        nor the tears of past remembered failure.
284           For this time the flame must live.
285    The bright flame turns back the seeking darkness. 
286       It brings day to to the everlasting gloom.
287              It brings light into my life.

294 Hrothgar: The Doctor's ways are only slightly plagarized, for several reasons.
295 1.  The Doctor that resides here has another name, but hates it; he'll deny
296 any such name exists.
297 2.  I believe that he has stolen a fully operational TARDIS, not one with a
298 'defunct trash-o stuck-in-a-box' chameleon circuit.
299 3.  He doesn't look like ANY of the real Doctor's incarnations.
300 4.  Point 1 implies that the Doctor has a mysterious past; this is the case.
301 5.  He's not NEARLY as intelligent as the real thing.
302 Now that THAT's been cleared up, I believe that I'll sit and wait around for
303 a message from him; he's not so daft as to miss that last one.  I'll get a
304 thorough tounge-lashing.

317     "Traffic! Traffic! Traffic! Is this one of your damn oddities or one of
318 your damn delights Fellows?" L'homme's voiced growled with a tone rarely
319 heard by is co-patriots. Fellows knew something was amiss.
320     "Take it easy Parity. You have driven in worse traffic than this. Why
321 remember that time in Paris, the West Bank, the Renault, and the Russian
322 double agent?" Once again Fellows was trying to calm the situation with his
323 rememberance of happier times.
324     "Yes...I remember. Sorry. It's Kosta. I wasn't going to tell you, but I
325 know Kosta better than either he or I have let on. It was I who was respons-
326 ible for sending him away to Bulgaria. He still blames me for separating him
327 from Mary. I could feel the resentment in his voice, in his look. Old wounds
328 like that never heal."
329     "I understand Parity. Better than you might think. Under my glib exterior
330 beats the heart of a man who DOES understand."
331     Farley, who had been rather silent through this soul-searching
332 conversation, spoke up. "Enough you guys. I think I'm gonna cry!" Cold stares
333 met Farley's remarks. "Hey! I was only trying to lighten things up. This
334 operation with Kosta is going to be tough enough, this kind of talk is only
335 going to make things worse."
336     Farley was right, and both Parity and Fellows knew it. They both had to
337 smile though; Farley was finally showing some of the mission rigor required
338 of a NET agent. "Ok Farley," Parity relented. "Nose to the grind stone, and
339 all that."
340     Parity guided their stolen auto through the streets of San Francisco with
341 the skill and determination that had won him the NET driving competition award
342 the last three years. It had been L'homme sans Parity that had unseated the
343 reigning champion Joshua back in 1982. Joshua... But that's another story.
344     "Golden Gate Park on the left boys, we are almost there. Get ready." 
345 Parity wasn't looking forward to the possible unpleasantries that he knew
346 might ensue, but he had a mission to accomplish. "Mission over all" thought
347 L'homme, repeating a phrase out of some past NET training pamphlet. "Ok,
348 house, or rather mansion on the left. Farley, I'm letting you off here. Go
349 around back, you know the procedure. Let us know if you get any business
350 back there." Farley jumped from the car with all the poise of a NET veteran.
351 "Farley is on his way." smiled Parity.
352     "I'm on the side, right?" Fellows knew the answer before he asked it. He
353 and Parity had worked together long enough to know each other's moves quite
354 well. "This should do it." Fellows exited the car, and made his way to the
355 vine covered high wall surrounding the Lamb Estate.
356     L'homme parked the car in front of the house. As he walked towards the
357 entrance gate in the wall, he spied a brand new BMW 318i parked on the
358 opposite side of the street. "Visitor? Kosta?" Parity wondered who would
359 be home besides Lamb. "Kosta is here, this is the logical place for him to
360 come." L'homme patted the standard NET issue sidearm in the side pocket of
361 his tweed jacket. It was painfully apparent that L'homme did not want to
362 have to use this method of persuasion.
363     The rings announcing his arrival at the gate fell on deaf ears, so Parity
364 was forced to pick the electronic lock to gain entrance. Nothing more than a
365 nuisance to a highly trained agent, but still a time waster. The house
366 seemed strangely quiet as he approached the handsome handcarved oaken door.
367 "What will I find behind this door?" Since whoever was in the house must have
368 heard the bells, Parity decided to enter sans knocking.
369      The ornate door creaked like an ornate door should. The sounds echoed in
370 the huge entrance chamber as NET agent Parity stepped on to the white marble
371 floor. Opulence seemed somehow inadequate to describe the decor found inside
372 the Lamb domicile. Knocked-out-cold did describe the condition of a very
373 high-brow looking Negro butler who lay sprawled on the stone floor three
374 feet from the entrance. "It would appear that someone has preceded us here."
375 L'homme mused to himself. "Let us determine the exact nature of this someone,
376 and if possible render this someone incapable of doing further damage to the
377 occupants of this house." L'homme had decided in the moments just after seeing
378 the unconscious man on the floor in front of him that the only way to finish
379 what he had started so many years ago with Kosta would be to return to the
380 book method. "Remember you are a professional. No matter how much it hurts,
381 detachment from emotion is the only way you are going to end this unfortunate
382 episode." Parity was an expert at the spy-rationalization. He had to use it
383 constantly.
384      Voices...loud voices from another room grabbed the paused agent's
385 attention. Angry voices....coming from upstairs. It was impossible to make
386 out the gender of those arguing, but it was clear this was no philosophical
387 discussion on the ethics of Kant. Withdrawing the weapon from his pocket,
388 agent Parity made his way up the carpeted stairs. Pressing a small switch
389 on the side of his weapon flashed a tiny LED on the identical guns of
390 Farley and Fellows outside. It was another invention of Ian's to let all
391 NET agents within a certain area know that weapons were being used. Of
392 course the weapons already had to be in the hands of the agents in question,
393 but Ian still felt it was a needed feature.
394      The voices were coming from behind a closed door at the end of the hall
395 on the second floor. L'homme could make out three distinct voices now, one
396 of which was female. "This is it. Showdown at the OK Corral. I wish it
397 were only a Hollywood western." Sweat trickled down Parity's forehead. His
398 hand moved towards the doorknob. Slowly he turned the handle. Silently he
399 opened the door. "Faire encore des siennes." Pushing the door open wide,
400 he stepped into the room; into the fray...

403 PS Stepping out of my spy guise: Mikey: I have recompiled all the adventures
404    with a new zapped version of the compiler. I will take note of the fix for
405    the .OVC file. Let me know when you have checked the 5-key status. Again it
406    might be something I messed up on. I hope it is that simple. There might
407    have been somthing wrong with the shell program I used to test things out.
408    Before I forget...no more dropped characters on the AT. Either it was a
409    fluke or it was fixed somehow(?).

411 PSS Stepping back into spy guise: Kosta take note : Front gate closed since
412     as the lawyer came to the house and found the gate open, he closed it.
413     I had a reason for Simpson being exactly who he is. Lawyer is in with
414     you two arguing it out. I thought I better clear those things up just in
415     case....

474 =================================================================
475      With a start I opened my eyes.  I was greeted with the 
476 garish light of a bare bulb. Getting up, I sat on the edge of the 
477 hard shelf that served as a bed, I groaned. My head ached. It 
478 felt as if it were the size of a weather balloon. My mouth was so 
479 dry, I was not even sure if I could speak.
480      I heard a movment. Looking up, I saw that Pam was also 
481 awake.  "Still not talking are we? Sigh... I wonder what possesed 
482 me to even to get into this mess.  I guess you are pretty enough 
483 in your own way, and those piercing green eyes of yours can look 
484 right into a man's soul." ..... "Not going to talk huh? Sigh...   
485 Oh well, I guess it's time to see what we can do to get out of 
486 here."  
487      I got up and moved over to the barred window, it was getting 
488 dark out, but there didn't seem to be much that could be done 
489 by that route. "Well, I hope that at least you'll cooperate and
490 help me get us out of this mess (assuming you want out...)."
491      Just then a key rattled in the lock. "Oh lord, here we go
492 again. No, this time I'm not going to let it happen again. I hope 
493 you're with me, because I'm getting out of here!" 
494      "OK." ... "She speaks!  You stand on that side or the door, 
495 and I'll stand on this side, when they come in we'll hit 'em. 
496 OK?" "Sure, why not?"
497      The door slid back to reveal Mr. toothless's sickening 
498 smile. We kept back against the wall. After a moments hesitation, 
499 Toothless stepped in wondering what happened to us. I yelled 
500 "Hey!" startled toothless looked in my direction, then came at 
501 me. About that time Pam jumped him, and grabed him in a sleeper 
502 hold. Taking the opertunity, I hauled off and kicked him in the 
503 stomach which caused him to loose what wind he had left. In 
504 moments he turned red then blue, and collapsed. "Good work! 
505 You're not bad at all!" Just then a shout came from the hallway 
506 outside. "Hey! What's going on in there?" Quickly hiding against 
507 the wall again, we waited for toothless's partner. Fool that he 
508 was, he saw toothless on the floor, and ran right in. I jumped 
509 him from behind.... BIG mistake... He just grunted, and reached 
510 around behind grabing me by the hair and pulled. As I was 
511 screaming in pain, Pam rushed up and stomped rather heavily on 
512 his foot which made him loose interest in me, then put her knee 
513 in a place that would do the most good. While he was screaming in 
514 agony, I jumped further up on his back forcing him to lean over, 
515 which Pam took the opertunity to introduce him to her knee once 
516 more, this time in the face. While he was dazed, and bleeding 
517 copiously, I got off and with all my strength slamed his head 
518 against the wall. I was greated with a hollow 'thunk' after which 
519 he slumped to the floor. "Good work! Though I don't think I would 
520 want to ever get on your bad sIde, you've got some pretty nasty 
521 tricks up your sleeve." "Oh shut up! quite wasting time, let's 
522 get out of here!" Stepping out side the cell. A quick look showed 
523 that the only other exit was a room at the end of the hall. 
524 Quickly moving towards it, we stepped inside. 
525      We found ourselves in a small room. Soundlessly the doors 
526 slide shut after us, and a sequential seriesof numbers on the 
527 wall began to light up - one after another. Some sort of cout 
528 down I figured, or perhaps a trick. I became aware of a faint 
529 whirring sound and got the weird feeling that we were being taken 
530 for a ride. Yet we were standing still! A fist tightened in my 
531 stomach and I felt sick. My ears began to pop like cheap gum. 
532 Pop! Pop pop pop! This whole thing was beginning to take on 
533 bizarre proportions, all right!

563 Here's a sonnet for y'all:
564 "A Medieval Fantasy"
565 
566 The cold dawn breaks upon the misty earth,
567 An unknown warrior into the world comes forth.
568 The knight himself of unchaste birth,
569 A stallion he rides is white, pure, named "Truth".
570 Brave, fearless, his devotion to a cause
571 Is unmatched, and his name will spread far and wide.
572 When soverign maidens fall to evil claws,
573 If he believes he can save her, he will ride.
574 To raise his sword named "Justice" in his hand
575 He will strike the heart of the evil empire's power--
576 Huns, godless liars, under a blood-red standard--
577 And crush their will, and their great war-towers.
578 But through the eyes of the evil empire,
579 Is not his cause no less one to conspire?
