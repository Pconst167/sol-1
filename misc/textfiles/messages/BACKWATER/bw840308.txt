44 [gBARD...I recognized a couple of the song books you mentioned. I too
45 enjoy the songs of parody, especially those of war, both earthbound and
46 intergalactic. You see to be in some trouble at the bolo lot, would you
47 and your group mind a little company? I myself am standing at the corner
48 of the next block watching the whole sceen, and although the going is tough,
49 the going looks fun. Let me know, since I don't like to reality-crash,
50 but I don't like to miss out on a good time either. I might even have a
51 few weapons and tricks up my short sleeve shirt that could aid you in 
52 your quest(no I DON'T know the wing span of an African Sparrow).
53 Well I will let you get back to your battle, and watch out for bolos
54 that LOOK like they are unoccupied!

61 I paused to survey my surroundings.
62 Someone had just blown up the shack at the rear of the lot; had a
63 bolo taken a shot at it? I wondered.
64 Some automatics weapons fire was coming from some brush just ahead.
65 A man in an orange robe crouched holding an AK-47 with his back to .
66 "Boo!" I yelled.
67  
68 The man in |he orange robe whirled with a surprIsed look on his face.
69 
70 <Whump> <Whump>
71 
72 The man in the orange robe fell face flat in the mud.
73 
74 Where has everybody gone? The last I saw of the Ninja he was on top
75 of a running VW, is that the Bard I see bellycrawling across the
76 feild ahead? I call out...

86 
87       I took off into the night at what seemed like the speed of light. This
88 VW can really haul! I I decided to go for it and slipped my tiger claws 
89 onto my hands. As I climbed down the side of the VW at 95 MPH I took a 
90 look inside. Surprise, surprise.
91                   The Ninja
92 P.S. Does anyone know who's in this VW, where it's going, or what it's 
93 doing?
94 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
95 AS I OPEN THE DOOR I NEARLY FALL INTO THE INN. MY CLOTHES ARE RAGGED, MY
96 APPEARANCE SUGGESTS SEVERAL DAYS OF UNREST.
97 I MOTION TO THE BAR KEEP FOR A MUG OF ANYTHING COLD AND WET.
98 AS I GRATEFULLY GULP DOWN THE DRINK I CAN FINALLY SPEAK.
99 "WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND HERE?!?!?  I JUST RETURNED FROM A LONG TIME
100 SPENT AT AN ALTERNATE REALITY KNOWN AS "O.S.U.".  COMING TO THE INN FOR
101 SOME RELAXATION, I WAS NEARLY RUN OVER BY A SENTIENT TANK(I BELIEVE IT IS
102 CALLED A 'BOLO'). I COULD HAVE SWORN I HEARD A VOICE INSIDE. I THOUGHT
103 THERE WAS NO PASSENGER ROOM IN ONE OF THOSE? AS I CONJURE A BOOK TO ME
104 (MY ONLY MAJOR PSEUDO-MAGIC TALENT), I EXAMINE THE BOLO TANK IN DETAIL.
105 YES, THIS IS WHAT NEARLY HIT ME. SHOULD I UN-MOTHBALL MY 'GOTTLOS P1' TO
106 PROTECT ME FROM THIS MENACE? I BELIEVE I WILL WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS,
107 BUT IN THE MEANTIME I SHALL OVERH PAULOS(MY GOTTLOS) AND MAKE HIM READY.
108 I CRAVE RELAXATION, AND WOULD GLADLY ACCOMPANY THE PIPER IF HE PERMITS.
109 UNTIL FURTHER ACTION, I DELIVER A WARNING:
110   I HAVE A FLEET OF 'OGRES' AT MY DISPOSAL. IT CONSISTS OF 20 MARK III'S
111 (EXPENDABLE) AND 10 MARK V'S(VALUABLE).  THESE WITH PAULOS CO-ORIDANATING
112 SHOULD CAUSE SOME PROBLEMS TO YOU BOLO'S RUNNING AROUND OUT THERE.

119 As I neared the sound of gun fire it quickly
120 changed from automatic to pistol? and then to nothing.
121 I rounded a bush and found myself triping over a robbed man (dead I presume)
122  Attempting to get up I saw two feet in front of me.  I followed the course 
123 of the persons legs until I was looking into Geo's eyes.  He then
124 began mumbling something about Changing his name.  I wasn't relly paying
125 much attention.  I was sick of being on the ground and just wanted up.

156 As I was sitting at my computer, checking to see what's new on the
157 local bulletin boards, I heard the sound of a large explosion, what 
158 sounded like a small war, and computer-generated-type voices (BUT
159 I DON'T HAVE AUDIO ON THIS COMPUTER!!!)
160 Looking at the screen, I see flashes of light, what looks like the
161 ruins of a building with dust settling around, and ---
162 !A VW tearing down the street at an extremely high rate of speed, with
163 a martial arts devotee hanging from the roof with one hand while
164 waving a GEARSHIFT? with the other!!
165            God, I've got to stop eating those pepperoni pizzas
166 so late (or get a new computer).
167 
168 
169 :::::::::::::::::::::::O O::::::::::voyeur:::::::::O O::::::::::::::::::
170 The gunfire had subsided and the sun was rising through a heavy haze of
171 smoke as the Poet peeked out from under the Bolo he'd chosen as his hiding
172 place. This wouldn't do at all! Not only had their presence triggered an
173 exchange of the very sort they were trying to prevent and endangered
174 innocent lives (his included), but now a crowd was gathering.
175 Thinking fast, he jumped up onto the Bolo and, pointing down the road,
176 shouted:"They went thataway"! In the ensuing confusion he jumped down and 
177 grabbed the first familiar preson he saw. It was the Bard.
178 "Help me round up as many as we can; the mob'll keep the fishnuts busy for 
179 a while. I think we'd best regroup back at the apprentice's gate."
180 #You'll be Sorrrry...#
181 There was that voice in his head again. If he got out of this alive, he
182 was going to have to get that looked into.
183                 && The Mad Actor &&
184 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
185 tThe piper wiped his brow.  "Apprentice -- trying to reality shift a number
186 of people is certainly difficult.  Part of the problem is that no two persons
187 see the same thing when they look at a scene.  Wshhen a number began to agree,
188 the details seem to get filled in.  For example, I can see that we have stopped
189 along a road, that we are near a stone bridge, but without turning I don't 
190 know what's behind me.  Sometimes I think that I really shouldn't try to
191 control what's happening so hard, but I keep on anyhow."
192   He sank down for a short rest on the grassy roadside, leaned back and let
193 the rising sun caress his tired face.  
194   Suddenly he rose.  "Apprentice!  The other group seems to be in trouble! 
195 Their reconnisance of the used BOLO lot seems to have sparked a full-scale
196 armed confrontation!  We've got to try to get them out of there before anyone
197 gets hurt too badly.  I suppose we should try to move the BOLOs to a more 
198 suitable reality for them also."
199   He stood up and inflated the pipes, then groaned.  "I've got an air leak.
200 I'll have to try to patch it temporarily, but it'll not be to reliable."
201   He took a length of yellow twine from his sporran, and tied off a section
202 of the bag that surrounded the stock of the outer tenor drone.
203 "There, that should hold it for a while, if the strain isn't too great. 
204 Apprentice, you should be careful about using too much klatha as we move, 
205 because if you pull in a vatch we could get into real trouble here.  If I 
206 suspend us just far enough out of the reality of the battle that we do not 
207 get in the path of weapon fire, could you reach the members of the other party
208 and pull them through to safety?"
209    Without waiting for the answer, the piper raised the pipes to his shoulder
210 and carefully inflated them.  He gently pressed the bag and raised the pressure
211 until the drones started.  The middle tenor was sounding an overtone, so he
212 stopped it with his finger, then popped his finger in the opening and started
213 the drone in the right register.  Adjusting the tuning of the drones, he raised
214 the pressure very carefully untin the chanter began to sound.  He ran his 
215 fingers lightly over the holes, listining carefully to the notes.  Finally,
216 he nodded his head, then began the first notes of the Urular of the song
217 "An cath gailbeach", or in English, "The desperate battle."  With the first
218 notes, the air around them seemed to turn silvery, then as the piper moved
219 into the first variation, the silver began to boil and move.  Dimly the sound
220 of automatic weapons fire set the time to the tune.  Moving closer, transparent
221 figures became visible through the surrounding mists.  Was that the bard, 
222 creeping on his belly through the mud?  There was the geologist, and
223 over there, the mad actor.  Sweat was pouring from the piper's forehead as
224 he fought to keep from being sucked into that reality of cannot blasts, 
225 whining bullets, and deafening explosions.

277 Thank the gods! Maybe this wouldn't turn into a disaster.

280 #Eric, how are you going to move the Bolos?#
281 #Bard, you saw the vial. If all else fails...#
282 #ERIC! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!!!!!#
283 Reality blurred. The tracers overhead slowed down... one flew past his face... 
284 A *firefly*?! It figured. Other changes occured, the small arms fire was dying 
285 away. The scene faded.
286 ~.~.~.~.~.~.~.
287 The apprentice wished that Kenin hadn't thougt so loudly, it was going to
288 be hard enough to maintain control. First, the bullets, fireflies seemed proper.
289 Now for the guns... what would be good... Of course! One of those (what had
290 they been called)... cap pistols! That was it!
291 Now to shift the people........ done! (wow, look at all the pretty colors)
292 (maybe he SHOULDN'T have taken that pill....)
293 Oops, almost missed M. l'homme sans parity!
294 NoW for thE difficult part, the Bolos.
295 #Kenin, dost thou have any suggestions?#
296 #Try Third Level, Humano-Robotic Alliance Subsector. About AD 2500...#
297 #All right... I 'see' it#
298 There that was done. He paused and then decided to straighten up a bit
299 as piper eased them away from the scene. He was really starting to feel the 
300 effects now, though. The last thing he heard before he passed out was:
301 "I can understand removing the damage. I can accept replacing the asphalt &
302 things with grass & trees. But RED grass? ORANGE trees with PURPLE leaves! And 
303 those animals... I'd never seen a paisley print unicorn before....."

306 To: whom it may concern.
307 We (BARD and the apprentice) decided that we had better co-author this

309 Yes, we do know each other. Quite well in fact. (Some of you even know

332 Ah, my friend, it's the same old story. LeRoy McKane hits town

334 
335 How many times have we seen this happen? A dozen? Two dozen? 
336 When will it all end?
337 
338 Before this is over half of Portland will be destroyed and 
339 McKane will retire to South America with another fortune. Did 
340 you know he owns a Bolo Manufacturing plant in Jatai? He's 
341 going to make a bundle out of this one.

388   The second in a series of self

390   persons!
391  
392     This week:   
393 
394        DEPENDENCE OF THE  COCAINE TYPE
395 
396 Cocaine is the prototype of stimulant drugs that in high doses can produce 
397 euphoric excitement and, occasionally, halucinatory experiences. These proper-
398 ties are highly esteemed by the experienced drug abusers and lead to 
399 high degree of psychic dependence. The
400 characteristics of drug dependence of the cocaine type are a strong psychic
401 dependence but not physical dependence
402 and therefore no characteristic 
403 abstinence syndrome when the drug is withdrawn. Tolerance does not develop
404 ; rather, some patients may become 
405 sensitized to the drug's effect.
406 There is a strong tendency to continue
407 taking the drug or to rapidly repeat
408 the dose. Cocaine is probably the 
409 example of a drug which neither 
410 tolerance nor physical dependence
411 develops, hich psychic
412 dependence develops tht can lead to
413 addiction.
414 
415      Quantitatively, the effects differ
416 strikingly with different modes of use.
417 When injected or inhaled, cocaine 
418 produces a condition of hyper-
419 stimulation, over-alertness, euphoria,
420 and feelings of great power. The 
421 excitation and "high" are similar
422 to that produced by injection of high
423 doses of amphetamines. Since cocaine
424 is a very short-acting drug, heavy
425 users may resort to injecting it
426 IV q 10 or 15 minutes.With this
427 repetition, toxic effects such as 
428 tachycardia, hypertension,mydriasis
429 , muscle twitching, formication
430 (the so-called "cocaine bugs"),
431 miniturized visual hallucinations,
432 sleeplessness, and extreme nervous-
433 ness appear. Hallucinations and
434 paranoid delusions may develop,as
435 well as violent behavior; the 
436 individual may be considered danger-
437 ous at this time. The action of the
438 drug, however, is sufficiently
439 brief to prevent sustained 
440 aggressive activity.  The pupils
441 are maximally dilated, and
442 elevations of heart rate, blood
443 pressure, and respiration result
444 from the drug's sympathomimetic
445 effect. An overdose of cocaine
446 produces tremors, convulsions
447 with a temporal lobe seizure
448 pattern, and delirium. Death may
449 be due to cardiovascular collapse
450 or respiratory failure.
451 
452      Treatment of acute cocaine 
453 intoxication is generally 
454 unnecessary because of the 
455 extemely short action of the drug.
456 If an overdose requires intervention,
457 IV barbiturates or IM phenothiazines
458 may be used. However,the respiratory
459 depression that accompanies cocaine
460 poisining can be worsened with 
461 large doses of sedatives. Anti-
462 convulsants do not effectively
463 prevent convulsions in cocaine
464 overdose. Discontinuing the use
465 of cocaine requires close supervision
466 and treatment.

574      Her eyes were radiant and her hair was a-swirl as she danced amidst
575 the new-blooming trees, joyously capering under the sunshine that deigned
576 to filter through them; her feet deliciously bare as they arched above the
577 earth's softness; her meandering, spritely song melted into croons whenever
578 she discovered new buds on the familiar trees, or when she chanced upon
579 a whiff of lilac.  Each time her song bubbled forth afresh, she tilted her
580 head back with closed eyes, bathed by rays of gold, and made up the words,
581 her hands sometimes lifting eloquently to complete a phrase that defied
582 words...and the affection and appreciation glowed in her face even though
583 some notes were errant, for she sang to her Creator, endeavoring to return
584 what she could for all the loving care that he'd put into this forest,
585 this earth...
She plucked a frail blossom, nestling it in her hair, and
586 considered the beginnings of a path before her, trailing her fingers on 
587 the bark of a rowan tree.  But what is this?  The ivy sheltered a scrap of
588 paper at the tree's base--'twas the pathetic remains of a note, tattered 
589 by the winds, bereft of its ink by the rains--with only the signature 
590 intact, that of "Tarn."  
Ah yes, she knew this fellow:  his brow was
591 creased with worry, and he was often to be found slumped asleep in the
592 back room of the Inn amidst empty glasses.  With gentle fingers, she
593 tried to smooth the sorry paper, but only could trace a letter here and
594 there, written by a hand familiar:  her eyes widened suddenly, and she
595 breathed:  "The Believer!  My old friend."  
But her thoughts were torn
596 asunder, because a flurry of paper abrubtly came tumbling down the path,
597 scurrying in front of the wind, just as if a writer had torn his journal
598 apart in grief and thrown it to the earthly forces!  Concerned for his
599 loss, she tried to catch the vagrant pieces as they dashed by; her small
600 hands captured only a few.  
Once her breath came back from chasing them,
601 she began to read...and the forest rang with merry laughter, for it was
602 an account of wild adventure, bewildered faces, and colour gone mad...it
603 was a tale of a mob that didn't know where it was crusading to, and leaders
604 who passed out while trying to conjure peace from chaos, and a Volkswagon
605 about to bump off a violence-crazed hijacker for his presumpteous act of
606 resurrecting himself...
Why, look what happens when women cease to grace
607 the Inn:  the menfolk try to create a nuclear war to ease the boredom!
608 Once again she was taken by laughter, and by the time the peals could be
609 reduced to chuckles, tears were trickling down her cheeks!  "How we need
610 Pam, our beloved peace-keeper!"  she remarked aloud, in the fading hope
611 that some winged creature might overhear, and convey it to her.  Sobered
612 by the memory of Pam's absence, she glanced back to the freshly-inked
613 paper.  "So they're meeting by the bridge, are they?"  Her feet turned
614 that way, picturing as she traveled a group of confused travellers all
615 facing different directions, and the distant sound of her chortle drifted
616 back to the rowan tree, ruffling the abandoned note.
