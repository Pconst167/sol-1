51 Txhe otter looked at the Apprentice with a stare that meant he'd like to 
52 do some very nastly things to the wizard in white. He turned to the cat t

54 that this &!*#$%' 'uman wonts me for some other devious purpous that'll 
55 most likely kill me dead before my days!" Then the otter turned to the ap
56 apprentice. "I wont nothin' to do with that bloo'y 'uman! 'e's caused me 
57 enough trouble as it 'tis! Now leave me alone and I can get back to my d

113 4 minutes!!! Sound like a deal?
114 Mudge... Nice of you to tell us these things. I bet the whole in is realy
115 interested too! They were calling in, waiting by the phone, listening to

117 this night, thank you, thank you. By the way, what's the deal with 40

119 someday I'll drive my matchbox car over and we can fill out tax forms

125 Above:  Who cares?  For the past week I have logged on and the only thing that
126 has been written, is arguments; accusations;etc...
127 This system is one for stories.(mainly)  Poetry, in my opinion, is great for a
128 change of pace.  What I can't stand is people who log on every 2-3 hours to 
129 write poetry.  There was a disk during this past week that was almost nothing
130 but poetry!!  Oh, well...'nuff said.
131 ??????????????? The Doctor ??????????????????????? June 30, 85 at 11:35 ???????
132 Above: Who cares? If the swells that the minstrel caused will now
133 subside, ie MUDGE dropped his other character - nice work on both
134 sides of the fence - let the inn return  to a  relative  state of
135 controlled chaos. Poetry is storytelling. Often it is far  deeper
136 than usual fictional prose, but it is still a story. Take a
137 serious look at THE TIN MAN's entry above. Can one honestly say
138 that is not story telling? I believe it is story telling in the
139 highest degree. Poetry is always welcome on my computer screen.
140 Minstrel shows a great deal of immaturity, but do not damn all
141 poetry for the lacks on some poetry. Please continue THE TIN MAN,
142 do not let the comments turn you away. Minstrel, remember 
143 moderation in all things. Please return when you feel your skills
144 have grown a sufficient amount.

153 "//////////": the recent decision by the FDA to let 8 food dyes
154 become legal again. They have been around sence 1965. You would
155 think after 20 years they would know if they caused cancer or
156 not? I am simpy wondering what it cost General Foods to have
157 this one done. By the way, I don't do PorSFiS. Saturdays are

161      No sooner had 09 climbed out, on the passinger side, concieled berreween
162 Freida and the hilside, than the first of a 'convoy' of semis came barreling
163 down into the wash.
164      It rolled to a stop at the gate, stood there for less than a minuet, then
165 rolled on inside.  Before long another arrived.
166      This, like the first, a set of doubles, 'iso' containers on fraim carriers.
167 These chassis had open-work basket type spare tire carriers underneath.  On the
168 first trailer this was empty.
169      It did not stay that way.
170      As its driver waited for security to wave him through, Carmichael scrunched
171 himself on/in and held on for all he was worth.
172      When next it stoped, the rig was in possition for loading.  So far so good
173 he thought to himself, now all I have to do is get transgered up with this load.
174      That would not be as simple as it sounded.  In the first place, only the
175 'ISO' box itself would be picked up by the ship's handling equipment.  The 
176 trailer chassis, of which the tire carrier was a part, would not.  Secondly, 
177 this particular box was of the smooth sided type with nothing appearent to hang
178 on to.  Thirdly, making the first two points somewhat academic, was that the
179 driver, a large burly Paiute, had jumped down from his cab almost as soon as his
180 rig came to a stop!

187   From a dim table near the periphery of the crowd, the piper watched with
188 a slight smile on his face.  The bickering and insults seemed familiar.
189 When would these newcomers learn how little a slight courtesy cost?  When
190 would they learn how much it bought?  A bargain is not a bargain when it
191 goes unrecognized!  The piper raised his glass to drain the bitter dregs.

241 say? Aye?? 
242 Ox, by the way...New Poet: You told the Minstrel that his poetry seemed 
243 to restrict itself to steady action scenes. Well you should look up a
244 your 'istory books an' read about wot a bloomin' minstrel does! That's 
245 their job. They are supposed to tell wot is 'appenin' 'round the world in
246 a song, not tell inner feelings and thoughts, although that's called 
247 for once in a while!
248 Don't get me wrong, guv'nor. I mean no malice toward you or your work, 
249 but I just thought I should tell you on the be'alf o7 the dead minstrel.

253 To "A Patient":  I don't damn all poetry.  I love poetry.  What drives me 
254 crazier is the people that call every 2-3 hours with some new stuff.  I know 
255 for a fact that every time I call, the disk is at least half to 3/4 full of it.
256 And it's all by the same two or three people!!
257 ??????????????? The Doctor ??????????????????????? July 1, 85 at 1:32 ?????????
258 
259 And the two or three people that write the poetry don't realy use the
260 rhyme that we associate with poetry. When I read poetry I personaly
261 think it should rhyme, one reason why I realy don't like free verse
262 that much. Free verse to me, looks like a normal sentance that some
263 person put on seperate lines, or a sentance on it's own line, not to
264 different than a normal paragraph. Dont
265 [GOD I HATE ENTER ONLY!] get me wrong, some free verse has a great deal
266 of meaning (it almost rhymes!).        -confused-
267 __________::::::::::__________::::::::::__________::::::::::__________::::::::::
268 Wow, what has happened to this place I used to come to for merryment, 
269 storytelling, good poetry, good talk, and good ale? Can it be that the Inn has
270 become a boxing ring? A wrestling mat? A political convention? All this talk
271 about poetry hating and all is just a plain shame. I, for one, love poetry
272 more than just about ax|~nything else on Backwater, bu must agree with the above
273 in the fact that |~too much of it is nothing but destructive. Take the entry
274 by the Tin Man for an example of the good variety that is worth carefully 
275 archiving for future enjoyment. I wouldn't waste the energy to turn my buffer
276 on for a good deal of the other rant. Speaking of rant, looks like I've done
277 enough of it for one day....

299 ????? The Doctor ?????
300 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
301 (switching to first-person, hope I can get this coherent)
302 The Doctor seemed down in the dumps as he sipped his refreshment, recently
303 dispensed from a nearby machine.  "Dr. Pepper", I believe he called it.  Grann
304 had asked for the worst-tasting liquid that the Doctor had handy (knowing 
305 from experience that Gnomish taste buds are far removed from human ones), and
306 the Doctor had mumbled, "Try the new Coke".  Grann had a tall glass of the
307 stuff.  Every once in a while he sipped it and commented that it was the best-
308 tasting sludge he'd ever come across.
309    I, of course, had a cold container of my own mixture.  In one of my empty
310 moments during a previous adventure in the TARDIS, I'd programmed the FoodComp
311 for a variety of my favorites.  It appeared clear except for a slight orange
312 tinge to i.  Once before, the Doctor had proclaimed it to be the vilest
313 concoction in the known universe, and he actually had made a half-hearted
314 attempt to have it banned by the Universal Chemical Administration.  In this
315 setting, then, we talked.
316    "That nasty little black box, Milch, is slowly draining power from the
317 Time Rotor, and storing it somehow.  It shifts my temporal course somewhat; I
318 have to compensate.  Not," he continued after a sip, "that my accuracy has
319 been of any great note in the past."
320    I agreed wholeheartedly, but kept quiet.  Instead, I said, "Is the power
321 drain constant?  Has it released in other forms?"
322    "No to one and Yes to two.  The drain is strongest as I approach... let's
323 see here, divide by 7, carry the 2... add 4... uh, the year 1985, Earth time.
324 Celene uses the same time reference, oddly enough.  Yes, 1985.  Oh, and as
325 for two, the box generates a powerful ethereal clamp on the temporal controls,
326 and tried to zap me when I got near it.  Whatever it is does NOT want me to
327 touch.  Look, yes, but not touch."
328    Grann slurped a large amount of his sluge (a.k.a. Coke), then spoke.  
329 "Maybe it wants you to stop somewhere in 1985."
330    "Yes, perhaps.  But where?  Not on Earth, surely.  I've just left there.
331 Not on Celene- not much of ANYTHING goes on there around 1985."
332    I saw an opprotunity for Grann to get some on-the-fly training.  "Doctor,
333 I could set up a program in the TARDIS computer to try to pinpoint the place.
334 How about running Grann through his paces in the Danger Room?  It may take
335 awhile, and I believe the exercise would be good for him."
336    A slightly sadistic gleam entered the Doctor's eyes, if only for a moment.
337 "Why, surely..." he said, getting up.  "Come along Grann, the room is this
338 way."
339    Grann looked up nervously, and swallowed the last of the swill.  "Okay..."

342   To the "If it doen't rhyme it isn't poety" person:  fine.  Call it narrative
343 prose then.  Just pretend I hit a few extra c/r's, and left out the punctuation.
344 Call it what you like.  Obviously it doesn't touch you.  Maybe you are to 
345 concerned with reading, instead of feeling.  But it's a test of my writing to
346 make you feel it.  I'll try harder.

350 .   .    Tin: You know it touches, do not let such words deceive you. For 
351 some: maybe not. That is okay. For others: yes. Forced rhyme loses its
352 meaning, becomes nothingness and does not fill the blank page. Incoherent
353 scribbles that serve no purpose but a linking sound in the ear. A sound,
354 no more, a pretty sound. Let not sounds bother you to force your words to
355 sounds. Perhaps, some, see no meaning. Okay, right? Different styles of
356 comprehension. Perhaps, others, see a meaning needing no sounds to connect
357 the words. They flow without punctuation to stop them, creating thought, 
358 images, meaning. Do not become bitter. It would not serve that smile of
359 yours well. The result, those poems, may be at a loss--forced, boxed in to
360 a congruent pattern. Trapped, and my mind could not follow the the unflowing
361 (one "the, sorry) words. There would be no where to go. Nothing to follow
362 but a regular, repeating sound. Different styles of comprehension.   .   .

427   Taking his pipes down from the dusty shelf on which they had lain for
428 many weeks, the piper carefully felt the bag.  Not bad -- leather drying
429 somewhat, but a few songs would restore the moisture.  Twisting the base
430 of the chanter carefully in the stock, he pulled it out and inspected the
431 reed.  Finding it satisfactory, he placed it in his mouth and blew a
432 brief blast on the chanter.  Replacing the chanter, he shouldered the pipes
433 and inflated them with two deep breaths, punched the drones in, then
434 began dancing his fingers over the notes of the chanter.

489 A cloaked figure entered the Inn.  He observed the harsh words that were 
490 being sent back and forth between the Patrons. He sat by a large table 
491 and drank some aliquidy blacks susbstance from a wineskin he had.  To 
492 all the people present who were in commune with the powers that worked 
493 in the larger spectrum, a strong sense of evil shifted through.  The c
494 cloaked one drank and sat silent.  A drunken apprentice approached, bo
495 bobbing and swaying as he walked.  "An...an who might you be?"  asked 
496 the apprentice, who reached up to remove the cloak from the figure.  A 
497 sharp electrical, but seemingly magical bite pierced the stupor of the 
498 Apprentice and he pulled his hand away, rubbing them.  They were quite bu
499 burned. b About 2nd degree burns.  "Fool!  That is of no importance to 
500 you!  I am here and that is all that is important!  You will know my n
501 name when you finally wake from your intoxication and recognise my aura!"
502 The apprentice swayed dizzily, as several people got up to help him to a 
503 room and a good rest..  After several hours, of which the cloaked figure 
504 didn't seem to move, the apprentice returned in a more sober state. 
505 The apprentice looked at the lcloaked gentleman and said. "I trust you 
506 found that quite amusing!  I can think of some nice little incantations t
507 could turn you from a human to a toad!" he said.  The cloaked fifgure 
508 laughed and removed his cloak, without being hurt by the electrical  
509 shock that had damaged the apprentice. A furry face appeared. A black 
510  covered part of it, though it was a natural mask. A mask of black fur. 
511 "nNo!" said the Apprentice, wide eyed.."Itcan't be you! You're dead!"
512 The ferret laughed. "Surely you do not think that the greatest mage who e
513 ever lived could die so easily, fool!" 
514 "Zancresta!" cried the Apprentice, as he tried to think of some spell 
515 would dispatch the feind before he caused any true damage to the Inn.
516 " you are but an apprentice, I sense!  Do you not realize WHO Zancresta 
517 is?" asked the ferret, his anger growing, he bared his sharp teeth. "I 
518 am Zancresta! Ferret and Wizard of Malderpot! The gratesrt Wizard who 
519 ever lived!"

527 Before I write my short story I would like to commend S.D. on his POEM.  It was
528      very well done, and deserves the best--- a one-night romance with Heather 
529 Thomas the model.  Hope you fun that night.
530 
531 Well here it is..........
532 
533   I jumped in my car and heard this moaning noise.  I didn't know what it  was 
534 and then I noticed my car was in love with me.  So as we both striped we started
535   She gave my nose the best blow job.  A come-like substance oozed out as she 
536 kept on doing it.  I couldn't stand it any longer and I started squeezing and 
537 sucking her two large eyeballs.  I bit the pupils of her eyes, and the hornier 
538 she became.  Before long we were engaged in it and couldn't be interupted. As I
539 slid down I found an opening, it had lips and i started flinging my tongue 
540 around licking it up as I go.  Talk about tasting so good.  It was now time to 
541 go to work.
542 
543                          The End.
544 
545 There is nothing like having a different kind of sex like this if your partner 
546 is unwilling to do the other one. I call it FACE-SEX.  Try it sometime.
547 
548 Just give a blow job to your partners nose instead of you know what.
549 
550 Instead gf squeezing her boom-booms squeeze her eyeballs, and nibble at her
551 pupils.
552 
553 Instead of eating her out, eat out her mouth.  The lips, and all is there too.

579 ????? The Doctor ?????
580 Some number of lines up a person wrote that the rhyme trapped the poem, keeping
581 it from being the best it can be. Sure it sounds nice with pretty sounds but 
582 it's easier to follow and understand something that is not so incumbranced.
583 So you look towards any writing that makes you feel something in side, no 
584 matter what form it is in. Any writing that has feeling in it is called poetry,
585 right? I bet there are a lot of people that have read large books, novels and
586 say they were moved by them, even short stories. Can you call those poetry?
587 Is poetry all in the mind of the reader? What it is, what it could have been
588 or how good it is, it's all in the reader and not the poem.. . . then why are
589 people yelling at others because they thought differently than the other reader
590 did?  Are they all just looking for an ascuse to yell at each other?
591 Do other poeple EVER think of the others points of view?        -confused-

603     Confused: As Webster's gives an accurate definition of poety, within 
604 those guidelines it is all in the mind of the reader. Was I, the person
605 who wrote some lines up, yelling at the rhyming poets? I had thought not.
606 I was only attempting to convince Tin Man (and whoever else happened to
607 care) that rhyming poety was not the only sort and that there are advantages
608 of other forms. As I mentioned twice, it is all in "different styles of
609 comprehension". This, or so I thought, was an example of thinking about 
610 the opinions of others. I hope this clarifies an misunderstanding in my
611 words. I had not realized they could be so confusing. Or, are you just
612 looking for an excuse to yell at me?  -Tanya

616 Tanya:  "...through meaning, sound, and rhythm..."
617      It's true that poetry doesn't have to rhyme, but it Mmust have a quality
618 (other than being set into indented lines) that sets it apart from prose. 
619 Poetry cannot and can never be considered "all in the mind of the reader" as
620 you put it.  
621      Some time ago I left an entry which stated that poetry, to be effective,
622 mshould have a rhythm or meter.  I was, of course, "corrected" by the free-style
623 poets of this board who also felt that poetry is in the mind of the reader.
624 All of the examples they cited involved situations where, though there was no
625 set meter, there was a rhythm scheme (ie growing like a tree)  which is 
626 obviously different from prose.
627      I'm simply getting tired of reading "poetry" which is nothing but indented
628 prose.  Oh, and thanks for the Webster thing, it completely supports my 
629 conviction that poetry must have a meter (or rhythm scheme).   T^(^)^(^)^(^)^(^)
