26 SO YOU THINK CONSERVATISM IS THE BUSINESS OF MAKING LARGER STICKS. IF THIS IS 
27 TRUE THEN CONSIDER THE GARDENER WITH A ZUCCINI PLANT: HE CAN PICK THE FRUIT WHEN
28 IT IS RIPE AND EDIBLE OR HE CAN LEAVE IT ON THE VINE TILL IT IS SO LARGE THAT IT
29 CANNOT BE OF ANY USE TO ANYONE SAVE A MENTION AT THE LOCAL FAIR. I DON' FIND 
30 THIS TO BE THE CASE HOWEVER. WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS IS THEY PICK THE FRUIT TOO 
31 SOON AND CHARGE A TOTALLY RIDICULOUS PRICE FOR IT. THIS IS OF COURSE THE OTHER
32 EXTREME. CONSERVATIVES ARE FAMOUS FOR THEIR EXTREMES. LIBERALS ON THE OTHER HAND
33 ARE USUALLY INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE NOT ONLY OF THE MASSES BUT OF THE GARDENER
34 TOO. PICK YOUR FRUIT WHILE IT IS AT ITS PEAK, NOT TO SOON NOR TOO LATE, GET A 
35 FAIR PRICE FOR YOUR LABORS. THIS ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE BUT THEN WHEN IS SOME-
36 THING EVER TRUE TO ITS COURSE. AS TO THE MATTER OF LUCK. YOU SHOULD DO A LITTLE
37 REASEARCH INTO THE SUBJECT. LUCK IS DEFINATELY A VIABLE ITEM IN TODAYS WORLD. NO
38 ONE MAKES IT ON HIS OWN. I DON'T CARE HOW HARD YOU WORK, YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE
39 OTHERS TO CREDIT FOR YOUR SUCCESS AND IF YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT THEN I PITTY
40 YOUR SELF-CENTERED LITTLE MIND, AND UN-
41 GRATEFUL ATTITUDE IN LIFE. 
42 SORRY, I SHOULD NOT HAVE USED THE WORD PITY AS IT DOES NOT APPLY IN YOUR CASE.

47 I hate to tell you this, but the attitudes of most "liberals"
48 seem to be closer to DJJ's appraisal than to yours. As for "conservatives"
49 don't assume that what he is calling a conservative is what you are
50 calling a conservative. (by the way, I was NOT attributing anything to
51 you, after replying to one of your comments I broke the text &
52 started a general comment. Sorry if the break wasn't clear enough)
53 I don't agree that all "conservatives" meet DJJ's description, but
54 anyone who does will probably wind up being labeled a "conservative".
55 Too many "liberals" are best described by the attitude "all men are
56 equal" with the unspoken corrolary "if they aren't then we'll MAKE them 'equal'"
57 One of the prime "liberal" "achievments" are the equal opportunity
58 laws. I'm all for equal opportunity, I've gotten rejected for jobs
59 for no "real" reason myself. But the "liberals" seem to think that
60 "equal opportunity" will mean "equal success", thus the various
61 quota systems (and the Bakshi decision etc). I'm sorry, we AREN'T
62 EQUAL!!! Everyone is better than other people at some things and
63 worse at others. The spirit of "all men are created equal" is best
64 served by recognizing that ABILITY is the only way to judge someone's
65 fitness for a job. Unfortunately, all we are going for is equal
66 numbers (sorry "proportionate"). I have heard of cases where a job
67 CANNOT be filled under the federal guidelines because NONE of the
68 qualified persons belonged to a minority & the company didn't
69 have "enough" minority workers. This has, on occasion, resulted in
70 hiring a "token" minority person to "front" for an assistant who
71 really does the work. 
72 I'm not about to claim that the "typical conservative" is better,
73 but they aren't much worse. The "conservatives" have caused many
74 problems, but the "liberals" show a real talent(?) for coming up
75 with solutions that are worse than the original problem! Civil service regs
76 are an example. There was a problem- getting good workers for government
77 jobs - does anyone think that the "solution" is working better?
78 Or, if you think that taxing the rich at higher rates to provide
79 for the poor is a workable idea, I suggest you check into the situation
80 in Britain or Sweden (a few years ago there was a news item regarding
81 the "unintentional" effect of a new Swedish tax law, it made the
82 tax rate for people earning above a certain amount 105%!). People
83 are leaving both countries because success in business (or whatever)
84 is actively penalized by the tax structure. I can see reasons for
85 a Minumum income below which you don't have to pay taxes or even
86 a "negative income tax" that would encourage people below the
87 "minimum" to try to earn money. But why DIS-courage people from
88 making money, after all, even at a "flat-rate" tax the more they
89 make the more the government gets. 
90 I could go on about other "liberal" idiocies, but why bother? one
91 of the traits of these self-proclaimed "liberals" is that they
92 seem to feel that anyone who can't see how "right" they are is
93 is stupid or else cynically trying to stop them for personal gain.
94 ("Obviously", I have something to gain from suppressing minorities
95 & exploiting tax loopholes, etc or I would be arguing against these
96 "good & beneficial" liberal policies) (by the way, does anyone
97 out there remember the story of the farmer who tried to save money
98 by feeding his donkey less?)

175 everyone here seems to think there are only two kinds of people, liberals and conservatives. I consider myself to be 
176 of the road. I have many conservative views but consider myself liberal in many ways.
177 It is disapointing that the political party system ibn this country has polarized itself.
178 There are very few politicians who are truly middle of the road. If they are they are penalized by their respective 
179 party. John Glenn comes close to being in the middle but he will probably no get the nomination because the old time
180 democratic liberals will keep him from it
181 and elect mondale. This is evidenced by the recent mondale endoresment by the afl-cio.

226 Well said Leonard!!!!!!!  I consider myself neither liberal or conservative, but I conclude that recently (within the last
227 20 or so years) liberals have been more damaging and dangerous than conservatives.  This was a change from the past, when the
228 opposite seemed to be true.  The problem, I believe, is that once liberals became powerful enough to pass laws, they couldn't
229 resist the temptation to 'get back' at all the un-nice people who were in power before. 
230 There is a difference, I believe, in 'doing right' and 'being nice.'  I can't believe, for example, that a shopkeeper
231 should be forced by the government to serve all people.  "Blasphemy!," I hear the liberals cry!  But why should I, having inv
232 ested by hard-earned money in a venture of my own choosing, not forcing anyone to do business with me, be forced to do 
233 business with somebody else?    And here is where the difference between 'right' and 'nice' comes in:  Sure, I'm notbeing 
234 'nice' to a person if I refuse to serve him, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he actually has a RIGHT to my services.
235    Liberals tend to believe that if an act isn't NICE, laws should be passed to prohibit it, even if the un-nice person
236 in question has every right to do that.  Another good example is in schools.  Private schools are a voluntary association
237 of individuals for the purpose of education.  There is no reason that such schools should be forced to accept any particular
238 student, even if such rejection would be un-nice.
239    To be sure, conservatives have similar problems.  They tend to legislate morality, passing laws against drug use, 
240 prostitution, gambling, and a host of others.  In this way, liberals and conservatives appear nearly alike:  Each has certain
241 likes and dislikes, BUT BOTH TEND TO FEEL THAT THEY CAN AND SHOULD PASS LAWS TO FORCE THE REST OF THE WORLD TO 'TOE THE LINE'
242 AND ACT THE WAY THEY WANT YOU TO ACT.
243    That's the big mistake.  I have my likes and dislikes too, but I don't claim to have any right to pass laws forcing
244 my preferences on others.  Most of the rest of the world (and most people in this country) consider government to be
245 mallet to bash one's enemies with when one is in power, and to be bashed with when one is out of power.  Eventually they
246 will see that this game of attack and counter-attack, manipulation and counter-manipulation is foolish, stupid, wasteful,
247 deceptive, unfair, and particularly childish.  They will know that government's only permissible function is the maintenance
248 of a society that we can all live in, free from force or fraud, in totally voluntary cooperation with each other.
249 
250    At this time, as I said, I consider liberals to be more dangerous, because they are attempting to set up a system where it
251 is difficult or impossible to achieve more by working harder (the so-called progressive income tax.)  They do this by forcing
252 the productive people to support the non-productive people.  This (naturally) encourages non-production, and thus stagnation
253 and deterioration of the society as we know it.
254 
255    My message to the liberals has always been this:
256 "Be as liberal as you want to be, as long as you aren't liberal with my money!"

304 it seems we are down to the question of governments. if a government is to rule by majority, the n some people's
305 rights will be abridged, depending on what is the majority view. Perhaps we should consider the principle of anarchy.
306 In that case a lots of people will have their "rights" abridged by other people and not the system, but with anarchy
307 perhaps there are no rights since there is no society to define them. 
308 ##############dss#####################
309 
310 
311 I think an important point should be pointed  out. That is, We have exsisted as a nation and a country for 200 years
312 without a significant change in the governing system. I think this is because of the adversary nature of our system
313 no one viewpoint is allowed to dominate because of checks and balance, which depend on a free press, public opinion,
314 and the elective system. A bbs like this contributes to the free exchange of
315 opinion which affects public opinion. If one side does something dirty, it is virulently exposed by the other side or
316 the press and the society will swing back to the middle again. Although this is not perfect, nothing is. Society has conditione
317 itself to be combative, this part of the underlying anarchy of human nature. An example is news reporting, if a
318 reporter reports something favorable about something he is judged to be "on the take" in a way. However if he reports
319 in a negative way, he will be believed.
320 That is why there is a lot of negative reports about the government, which often hinders the business of governing. This 
321 is a good example of the nature of our system.

329 Scribbler & Whip:  Why would anyone want ANOTHER advertising BBS in

331 the appropriate format for this purpose.  If advertisements excite
332 you, I suggest you try one of the following BBS numbers:

347 will patiently watch and wait until the subject changes to philosophy/religion, culture, sex, etc.
348 
349 CYM:  I'm afraid I must disagree this time.  I believe that "luck" and 
350 "chance" are abstractions used where the causative agent is not clear,
351 or is not desired to be disclosed.  Neither exist in reality; for every
352 phenomenon there is a cause, whether or not it is humanly concievable.
353 I am also of the opinion that there are extremely few who are incapable
354 of providing for themselves, but there are multitudes (particularly in this
355 country) who prefer not to.  As to the
356 political implications of this I would not speculate.  To the extent that my
357 limited political adeptness will allow me to form opinions, I am largely in

398 PAM: BUT OF COURSE YOU ARE MISSED! YOURS IS A VOICE OF CALM AMIDST THE
399 INSANITY THAT SEEMS TO HAVE OVER TAKEN BWMS OF LATE.
400 DOM: DO YOU HAVE A PASS WORD FOR THE IMSAI SYSTEM? (IT IS JUST ANOTHER
401 BBS/CPM [RCPM] SYSTEM FOR CERTAIN PRIVATE USERS WITH PASSWORDS.)
402 Leonard: YES, PROBABLY.
403 OTHERS: YAWN.. HOW ABOUT MOVING ON TO ANOTHER SUBJECT? AFTER HEARING THE
404 SAME ARGUMENT FOR THE 20TH TIME IT DOES GET TO BE A BIT BORING....
405 ANYONE: I'M LOOKING FOR A SOMEONE WHO KNOWS TRS-80'S (2,3,4,12,ECT.) 
406 PARTICULARLY THOSE RUNNING CPM. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS.
407 PLEASE LEAVE A NOTE HERE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN TALKING.
408 ********** CISTOP MIKEY ********* 15 OCT 83 ******** 10:21AM *********
409 HOW ABOUT A CHANGE OF SUBJECT? RUMOR HAS IT THAT MA BELL IS THINKING OF
410 CHARGING A SUR CHARGE IF YOU USE A MODEM. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I HAVE HEARD
411 AMOUNTS AS HIGH AS $50 A MONTH. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ON THIS, YOU
412 MIGHT ALSO LEAVE A NOTE ON CBBS STATING YOUR VIEWS SINCE JIM IS VERY
413 INTERESTED IN THIS TO THE POINT OF DOING BATTLE WITH MA.
414 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MY VIEW, IT IS SIMPLE: AS I HAVE STATED BEFORE, I 
415 HAVE A LIMIT ON WHAT I WILL PAY FOR MY BASE PHONE CHARGES. THAT BEING
416 $50 A MONTH TOTAL. IF IT EXCEEDS THAT I WILL CUT BACK WHERE I CAN UNTIL
417 IT DROPS BELOW THE $50 MARK. SINCE I HAVE TWO LINES, THIS MEANS I HAVE 
418 BEEN PAYING $37 A MONTH BASE CHARGE FOR MY PHONES. ($14 FOR BWMS)
419 THE FIRST THING I WILL DO IS CHANGE BWMS TO A METERED LINE. THE NEXT WILL
420 BE TO DROP THE CUSTOM CALLING PACKAGE ON MY VOICE LINE. AND FINALLY ALL
421 ELSE FAILING I WILL DROP BWMS. PERSONALLY I FEEL THERE IS NO REASON TO
422 BE CHARGING A SUR CHARGE FOR USE OF A MODEM. IN FACT, I THINK IT IS A 
423 BIT FOOLISH ON MA'S PART TO DO SO SINCE IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE
424 THE PRIVATE USE OF MODEMS ON THE PHONE SYSTEM WHICH WILL MEAN LOST INCOME
425 TO HER (PARTICULARLY IF SHE GOES TO AN ALL METERED SERVICE.). MORE
426 IMPORTANTLY THE MAJOR LOSS WILL COME FROM SECONDARD PRIVATE PHONE LINES
427 BEING DROPED BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE COST, AND LOSS OF THE LOCAL LONG
428 DISTANCE REVENUE GENERATED BY THE USERS WHO ARE LONG DISTANCE FROM THE
429 BBS'S. THE REASON FOR THE SUR CHARGE THAT I HAVE BEEN GIVEN SO FAR IS
430 THAT IF YOU HAVE A MODEM, THEN YOU CAN AFORD THE EXTRA CHARGE ON YOUR
431 LINE TO HELP DEFRAY THE COST FOR EVERYONE ELSE USING THE PHONES. WHAT
432 SEEMS TO BE FORGOTTEN IS THAT THIS IS A HOBBY FOR ME AND I CAN NOT AFFORD
433 TO PAY OVER $50 A MONTH FOR A HOBBY! THAT IS MORE THEN I PAY FOR
434 ELECTRICITY! (AND I'M ALL ELECTRIC HERE.) I HAVE A FEELING THAT UNLESS
435 MA WAKES UP SOON AND FIGURES OUT HOW TO PROVIDE PHONE SERVICE AT A
436 REASONABLE COST SHE MAY FIND COMPITITION FOR LOCAL LINES AS WELL...
437 AT $50 A MONTH IT BECOMES A VERY LUCRATIVE BUSINESS, AND THERE WILL
438 BE MANY CLAMORING FOR A PIECE OF THE ACTION. WANT AN EXAMPLE? HOW 
439 MUCH ARE YOU PAYING FOR CABLE? (BY THE WAY THAT SYSTEM IS ALREADY 
440 LARGLY INSTALLED AND IT WOULD BE FAIRLY EASY TO ADD VOICE CAPABILITY 
441 TO IT......)      NUFF SAID
442 ********* CISTOP MIKEY ************ 15 OCT 83 ****** 10:48AM *********
443 Mikey,
444   I know a lot about TRS-80 Model's 1,3 and 4. Any questions?

446 weekends or from 4:00pm to 8:30pm on weekdays.

451 REPLACE
452 MIKEY: I UNDERSTAND THAT MA-BELL IS ALREADY CHARGING THE SUR-CHARGE IN THE 
453 SOUTH WESTERN STATES LIKE TEXAS. SEEMS THE PHONE LINES THERE DON'T SUPPORT 
454 GARBAGE FREE TRANSMISSION OF DATA SO IF YOU HAVE A MODEM AND WANT TO USE IT 
455 YOU MUST PAY FOR AN UPGRADED LINE. THE PHONE SYSTEM THERE BEING RATHER DATED
456 NOT LIKE OUR RATHER NEW SYSTEM HERE IN THE N W. OF COURSE IF THIS CATCHES ON
457 AND THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT, WATCH OUT!

460 about the modems..the phone company will never know that I have a modem
461 and I dont think there is anyway they can find out since I plug into the
462 hanset outlet. If I was using a audio or non direct connect modem, I think
463 there is a definite legal recourse sinceyou would not really be hooked into
464 the phone lines, but instead it would
465 be like talkng into the phone normally
466 except you are using a computer. The phone co. cannot stop you from using yo
467 your own equipment,(court decision) so it seems to me there is a legal 
468 precedent here. The only problem is how data transmission is legally defined
469 ###############dss###################
470 DSS, you're misinformed if you think that plugging your modem into the hand
471 set plug the phone company won't know you
472 have a modem.   The most obvious and direct way they'd know would be to scan calls for continuous noise (carrier tone) and
473 home in on these lines for further analysis.  I agree that we shouldn't pay more for a 'data-grade' line, especially since
474 we didn't ask for it:  Modems were DESIGNED to be able to use voice-grade lines and transmit correctly, and we paid good
475 money for this capability.  Secondly, it is unlikely that the phone company even has the option of selecting between voice- 
476 and data-grade lines for any given call or caller, so the extra money is a farce. 
477     One way TPC (The Phone Company) may get around this is to eliminate the option of unlimited local calling and go to a
478 metered rate for all customers.  This way, modem users would automatically pay more, simply because they tend to use the 
479 phone for a longer period of time.  Let's hope this doesn't happen.
480 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Anon :::::::::::::::::::
481 P.S.:  What's the definition of a Born-Again-Conservative?
482 Answer:  Anyone whose arguments confuse a liberal.
483 ::::::::::::::
484 Im not sure the phone co. can listen in on your phone conversation to check if there is a cont. tone unless they
485 have a court order. And like I said if you are using a non DC modem, as long as you are not hooked up to the lines, 
486 the information you transmit over the lines, be it data or voice is your own
487 business, protected blaw.

491     Hello, all......Back I am,......equipment seems OK, I guess BWMS
492   is the best place to check a terminal....something like "worst-case"
493   testing.....I must apologise for dissappearing on everybody, I have 
494   had a rather harrowing rs-232 interfacing adventure with my system 
495   for the past few weeks........seems functional, though....
496 
497     Many new people out here. New (?) ideas too. Certainly a new topic;
498   but why something as MUNDANE as GOVERNMENT? Let's get esoteric. I
499   suggest "Utopia: acheivable or Erehwon". All you behavorists speak
500   up. Anyone for Twin Oaks? Baby boxes? (air-cradles for the less
501   familiar (take note MIKEY, not familur......i know, i know....i have
502   a minimum of 20 spelling/gramatical errors in this text; but your 
503   "familur" always drives me nuts......) with B.F. Skinner....
504 
505   A special hello to PAM; to whom I abandoned mid-thought....What's up?
506 
507   And BAD; do I have some BSP's for you!
508 
509   Dave: where is d???
510 
511                                                           Aaron
512 <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
513 
514 No, I dont think utopia is achievable due to the underlying anarchy of human
515 nature. How do you define Utopia?
516 #################dss###################
517 
518 Yes, we can and do listen in to conversations. The law prevents us from
519 using the information heard, but don't bet on listening being unlawful.
520 It isn't. We can listen to verify line quality, or to determine the type
521 of usage. different states laws vary. The SW Bell surcharge pertains to
522 what are called 'information providers', and was originally intended to
523 apply to data base and time share computers; it is about 5 years old,
524 they just started aplying it to everybody. It does not concern how
525 you get the data online and affect all data, whether direct, via the
526 other side of the phone, or acoustic, or whatever.
527 Full, required metered service was requested by P NW Bell, but was 
528 denied by the PUC. You may soon expect to see a limited usage allowed,
529 both outgoing and incoming, with a surcharge for more use, or 'meter'
530 style rates for more usage. Also, now with divestiture, expect the
531 cost of flat rate to rise a lot, and when most low usage people are on
532 metered service, the high users will have a much higher rate for flat
533 rate. PNB officially denies plans for a special data rate, but is
534 probably waiting for the courts to decide on the SW Bell case.
535 
536 As to the merits of liberal vs conservative: extremists are all 
537 dangerous, both are extremists... I have never met a politically active
538 person who I would trust, with anything.
539 Luck is. If we can't predict it, it is pure luck. It may have a cause,
540 but unless you know or can control the cause, it is pure luck. You may be
541 able to define it differently, but it still is the same thing. It is
542 called 'unimportant' by those who have been favored by it, and the rest of
543 us know better. Without luck the poor black in South Africa has the same
544 chance at success as you do, and he doesn't because he wasn't lucky enough
545 to be born a white male in the USA. We all like to believe we ourselves are
546 in control of our destiny, it make us feel godd, strong, important, etc,..
547 We don't. Whe I go out rock climbing I prefer to climb with someone who
548 is a little scared, he is careful. The climber who has never fallen and
549 believes he is too good will sonner or later kill someone, and I don't 
550 plan to be that someone. I won't climb with him. Same is true of any
551 venture. Good looks, etc will help overcome bad luck, but still.
552 (By the way, how did you choose your parents who gave you your good genes?)

555 Typical Argument:    Productive person:  "I got where I am through hard work"  (True)
556                       Non-productive person:  "But you were helped by others"  (Also True, but wait!)
557 
558     While it may be true that people depend to some extent on the efforts of others to get where they are, unless you
559 are prepared to quantify your arguments you'll get nowhere.  Even though a Productive Person may have depended on others
560 to some degree, that degree may be so small as to be ignorable and pointless.  If we consider the average productivity 
561 of everyone in the world, we will find that about half (not necessarily exactly half) have a productivity greater than
562 the average, while the other half have a productivity less than average.  But almost no-one is totally independant on 
563 anyone else; This is not the point, though, I'm glad to say.
564 Here's the decisive counter-argument:  In a canoe with two rowers, it doesn't matter who rows harder and who is
565 lazy.  Both canoers get to the destination at essentially the same time.  But that doesn't mean that each did the same
566 work during the journey, certainly.  And while the lazy canoer may say that part of the hard-working canoer's success 
567 (getting to the destination) was due to him, in fact more of the lazy canoer's success was due to the hard-worker.
568      Similarly, just because we depend on others in this world doesn't mean that we can claim no credit for our own hard
569 work.  There are lots of 'lazy canoers' in this world, and they are quite fond of pointing out that they are in some
570 way necessary.  
571      And while 'luck' (chance) may have some influence in our lives,  it is often used as an excuse by the lazies.
572 I have never heard anyone claim that luck was TOTALLY responsible for our lives, so I'd like to hear the estimate of
573 it's effects by those who believe it to be significant. 50%?  75%  90%?  Just how much of our success can be attributed
574 to that luck?  And if it is so great, why would anyone WORK HARD when they KNOW their success (or lack of it) is
575 preordained by chance, and they can do little about it?  
576     But that's just it!  That's why the lazies tend to believe in luck!  And that's why those that believe in luck tend to
577 be lazy!  If you think your hard work accomplishes nothing, you won't do it, will you?  Your success will come to you no 
578 matter what, so why work?  And you will believe that anyone who is successful got that way due to pure chance, not
579 hard work.    And, therefore, you should be able to take 50% of that guy's luck in taxes and spread it among the 
580 unlucky, right?  The guy didn't deserve it anyway, did he?  Nah!  The guy didn't work hard (only a fool would believe
581 that working hard causes success) and even if he did, that was completely independant of his success, right?
582 
583      I got where I am through my own hard work, and I resent anyone implying that my success is mostly/totally due
584 to chance.  Or mostly/totally due to the work of others.  Everyone is, to some degree, depedant on others, but to
585 distort this fact to justify theft is just that, a thief.
