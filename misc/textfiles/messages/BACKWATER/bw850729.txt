21 Mikey: I have tests Wednesday and Thursday, so I wouldn't be able to pick up the new copylink disk until
22 Thursday night. If that suits you, fine. What are the changes in this new version? Still no luck on the VT100
23 stuff. When I get the new copy, I will go back over to Chuck's to test the jr again. I will 'custom' a COM2:
24 version before I go. I hope that is all it is...otherwise? Good job on the Tandy! I'll see if the school
25 district is interested in buying a copy (they have two Tandy's and the only software is Vidtex (yuch)).
26 Kosta: Nerd has the file? I haven't been able to get on today, bust busy busy. I bet those guys are fooling
27 around with the computer (as if I 
28 didn't know)
29 _Leonard_: Did you ever get that YMODEM file? Can you bring your fancy cable to the PCS pizza-feed on Thursday?
30 Voyeur: Three more disks for you: Just when you thought you had all your files sorted!
31 Mikey again: How many archive disks this time? Gee, I never got $$$ from all my cohorts last month...
32 I also have a couple questions about this AMODEM stuff, and before I forget, what is this LNW80.ASM file on here???

46        One Heck Of A Solution
47 
48 
49      As I was thinking about how to save my skin, I goot a heck of an idea.
50 If I could live in a spaceship, it would end my problems. All I had to do 
51 was design it to provide enough food and air to live on. 
52      But I had a massive problem. Without gravity, the food I was growing 
53 would float about. I can just see a cow 100 feet off the ground; or a plant
54 on the celing. How could I get artificial gravity?
55      I studied gravity and found out that nobody know why gravity exists.
56 Or even why it works. I was up all night thinking about it.

71         "So, jealousy was it?  Now I know neither of us are faulty.  Your jealousy over Mary
72 is what sent me away," Kosta noted.  "And mine has brought me back, although far less skill-
73 fully, to topple you through Agent Gaudy Minsky.  Both attempts were mutually quite self-
74 destructive, and only one of them looks to have succedded."  Kosta then drooped his head.
75         After taking a moment to think over their past weeks actions, L'homme said, "And 
76 we see just how little we have truly accomplished....  We'll step out now, I realize that 
77 there must be matters you would like to settle before we must be off.  I'll leave you to
78 your farewells, alone."
79         "Some time alone...  Yes, that's what I need...  what we need right now, some time
80 alone," stammered Miss Lamb as she nervously worked over a few papers on her desk.
81         "Remember," said L'homme, "we'll be right outside.  Waiting."  Kosta simply nodded
82 in acknowledgement to L'homme's offering of solitude for he was speachless.  L'homme lead
83 the way out the door, followed by Agent Fellows, with the situation well in hand.
84 Despondantly, Kosta closed the door behind them...  There was silence.
85 
86         Mary walked slowly across the emptied office to Kosta.  "I'll never forget what
87 you meant to me," she said in a hushed voice.
88         Kosta was not sure of what to say, what to do until Mary tenderly placed her arms
89 around him and gave him a lingering kiss, holding onto him tightly.  In an instant he
90 realized and recipricated her actions.  He had hoped, foolishly, that it was a sign of
91 something he could look forward to, even now.
92         Slowly she loosened her hold on him although he still held on.  Her hands moved in
93 a way that he was unable to notice.  "And I'll never forget what you have done to me by
94 having left," she said coldly.  "You bastard!" she sobbed.
95       Then she very carefully planted the cold metal blade of her letter opener squarely
96 within Kosta's back, drawing them both toward her.  "I've given up pretending."
97         With that Kosta's body straightened, then began to crumble to the floor.  His grasp 
98 on Mary's dress became weak, the fabric passing between his fingers.
99 
100         Somehow the sound of Mary's voice accompanied by the sound of a body falling
101 brought L'homme and Fellows back to the inner office's door, it flew back open.
102         The scene was picturesque, and couldn't have been any clearer; Mary Lamb standing
103 still over the body of former NET Agent Kosta, crimson glistening from the blade in her
104 quivering hand to match that of the pool that began to spill onto the plush carpet.
105         "Do you get the impression, L'homme, that we were watching the wrong person all
106 this time?"
107         "You just keep an eye on Mr. BMW, I'll take care of things in here," he snapped back
108 at Fellows.  "And just where in the dickens is..."
109       "Alright, don't anybody move!  I've got you covered!" cried the voice as
110 the man
111 came spilling into the room with his .38/.45 cal. revolver/automatic waepon drawn in his
112 left/right hand.
113         "...Farley?" finished L'homme.
114         "Speak of the devil!  I think I just found him for you," added Fellows with a grin.

138   The piper approached the strange-looking machine that Trainor seemed sp
139 proud of.  Disciplining his instinctive recoil, the piper forced himself to
140 admit that it was really attractive -- in a roccocco sort of way.  After all,
141 he mused to himself, decorations could be used to enhance the form of objects.
142 Why was it necessary to keep the object after the decoration had been carried
143 to the point where the object was overwhelmed?  Really, why should he have
144 any objections to stained glass observation windows?  And, after all,
145 reproductions of carved roses in stainless steel really did not look quite 
146 so out of place with the brass cherub blowing a long, straight trumpet
147 while balanced on one foot on the radiator cap.  Gently reaching out, the
148 piper touched the machine while Trainor beamed his approval.  A strainge
149 tingling warned the piper of leashed energies contained within this machine.
150   Gently fingering a bas relief along the door, the piper looked at Trainor
151 who seemed genuinly proud of his machine.  Glancing down the piper looked
152 at a scened embossed in a panel.  Startled, he glanced closer at the scene
153 that he had been tracing with his fingertips -- a woodland scene, a group
154 of young ladies who, refusing to be overcome by the excess heat, were
155 opting for the coolness of varying degrees of nudity -- a strange, hairy-
156 legged creature playing some sort of instrument -- a ...
157   Hastily, his face burning, the piper turned away from the scene graphically
158 depicted on the machine.

161 gaaax!
162 (sorry about that...brother playing with keys..oh how I hate enter only!)
163     Zephyr sat there on his table, hurt at Trainor's utter unwillingness to let
164 him come along.  
165 (Error again.  change to:)
166       I sat there on my table, hurt at Trainor's utter refusal to let me come
167 with him in his pell-mell vehicle.  The words rang in my ears, and a small and silvery tear slided down my face.
168       I shopped down to the floor of the Inn, past some people I didn't know that well with swords and axes, and
169 waited for someone to open the door to enter or leave.  Someone left the inn, and I left, too.
170       I came upon the Pell-Mell.  Why, it was all I had expected it to be.  It
171 was utterly marvelous!  The design was so perfect!  It was a masterwork in 
172 itself.  It was just beutiful.  I hopped over to Trainor, who began to sneeze 
173 again, bidding me go away.  I backed off a bit, and then spoke saying "This Pell-Mell, I love it!  It's the most 
174 wonderful device I've ever seen.  I love the design, it's perfect." Trainor beamed ans Emu, Piper, and Scarlett 
175 Lion beoan to stare at me as if I were a candidate for a noose.
176     "Ho *sneeze!!* Small bunny.  Listen, I can't take you along." 
177     "Please!" I said, looking at Trainor with soulful eyes. 
178     "N-*Sneeze!* No."
179     I cried, Then I looked at Trainor and said "Then take this, to remember 
180 me while you are gone." I handed Trainor my very last Truffle.  He took it.
181     "*Sneeze! *sneeze!* SNEEZE!*
182     An idea struck me.  Maybe he wasn't really allergic to me at all.  I began 
183 to back away.
184     ">sneeze!< >SNEEZE!< >Sneeze!<"
185     I moved so far away that he couldn't possibly be irritated by me.
186     "Sneeze! Sneeze."
187     That was itt! I hopped straight into the air in truejoy, a feeling like joy
188 only better. (No, it's not a typo, it'S really spelled together: truejoy.) 
189     I took the truffle away and threw it as far as my little arms could, which
190 was just out of allergy range. 
191     Trainor sniffed, and smiled, saying "So I'M not allergic to you after all,
192 so I guess you can come along!" 
193     "Thank you!" I said.  I hopped onto his shoulder as he bent down to me. 
194     "So, you like my machine??"
195     "It's lovely!  Simply lovely!  Wonderful! Beutiful!"
196     Trainor smiled.
197 :::::=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::===Zephyr:=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::=====
198 Trainor:  Please don't get rid of me like this.  I won't encumber the adventure and I'll take good care of
199 myself.  Really!  Just wait and see!"

202   From a small window at the back of the inn a face peered at the large metal
203 contrivance.  A smile stole on to lips that had been still too long.  He smiled
204 broader as the group began to look over the machine, some with hesitation, some
205 with excitement.  Having some interest in large metalic devices he reached to 
206 retreve his cloak from the back of his chair.  Perhaps a little closer look.
207 No starry-eye adventurer this one, but a look wouldn't hurt.

304 "Enough joking!" NET agent Parity screamed! "Don't you realize that one
305 of our fellow agents lies bloody at our feet!" Never is all of the missions
306 Fellows and Parity had been in together had L'homme ever acted so enraged.
307     "Farley, take Miss Lamb into the other room and keep her and Beamer
308 covered. Call Ian via comset, let him know we have regained Kosta, and have
309 him send in the cleanup units. Fellows, I want you to help me with Kosta."
310 Parity spoke like a man possessed. His actions were hurried yet even in the
311 semi-panic that permeated the room, Parity seemed to know what he was
312 doing. "We have to get him out to the car Fellows."
313      "But L'homme, it's too late. Kosta is kaput. Mary has seen to that."
314      "No it is not too late! Now help me or God forgive what I'll do to
315 you!"
316      "Ok, ok L'homme." Fellows knew when to back off. They had worked together
317 long enough to know each other's limits. L'homme had reached his emotional
318 limits now; nothing could be gained and everything lost by pressing matters.
319 The agents worked quickly, bundling up Kosta in blankets from a nearby bed-
320 room, and carrying him to their car outside the Lamb mansion. As they pulled
321 out, an unmarked van drove up to the front of the house. Fellows could
322 see in the rear-view mirror the Butler, Mary and her would-be suitor being
323 herded into the back of the van under the watchful eye of Eugene Farley.
324      Kosta is kaput, isn't he? Fellows pondered this while he drive through
325 the streets of San Francisco towards NET's Bay Area medical facilities, a
326 division of the Mt. Siani West Medical Group.
327      Ian would take care of everything at the house. Eugene would head up
328 the news-blackout. The neighbors will think this is another one of Mary's
329 party-coupes. Mary was famous for her elaborate party-preparations. NET
330 would find a way to answer all the questions. All the questions but one...
331      What did happen to Kosta? Did he survive his ordeal by blade? Did the
332 agents get him to the hospital in time? No one really knows except agent
333 Parity, and he isn't talking; and Kosta, and he is no-where to be found.
334 Maybe he isn't to be found because he simply isn't anymore... L'homme refused
335 to discuss the matter with Fellows or Farley, going out of his way to change
336 the subject whenever it was brought up.
337      "We need a rest guys. I suggest we take in the sights of San Francisco.
338 Fellow? I understand you are quite the expert on this city. Something about
339 1000 oddities and 1000 delight?"
340      "Oh-boy oh-boy oh-boy!" palpitated Farley.
341      "Settle down boy!" Fellows laughed. "Allow me to be your guide to this
342 beautiful city. Remember this is the queen of the Pacific!"
343      "Gawd no!!!" Parity and Farley said in unison.
344      "Just kidding, ha ha...Just kidding."

348 Kosta? Let him rest in peace for now. Everyone will remember him, in the back
349 of their minds, and in the front of the conscience. Someday maybe, but for

364 It was a dark and stormy night.  The old house creaked.  "C R E A K ! !", it 
365 went.  The only light was from a flickering candle.  I walked slowly down the 
366 hall, my eyes drifting warily from side to side.  I told them to stop wandering
367 around and get back in my head.  Approaching the door, I heard a faint beep of
368 a faintly beeping computer.  My knees turned to jelly.  Scooping them up, I put
369 them in a plastic bag for later.  I knew what was behind the door even before I
370 opened it.  As it opened, a musty odor flew out.  Then it screamed and ran down
371 the hall.  A tall figure was in the room, lit only by a computer screen.  The 
372 glasses and the dark hat it was wearing confirmed my deepest fears...  It was 
373 a Jeffslime.  I tried to run, but I realized my knees were in my pocket.  I was
374 doomed.......
375                                                 The Doctor-for Guido.

378 Doctor: I'm sure Guido will love his publicity.  One question, if you have
379 
380 time to enter that, why not some of your own stuff?
381 Max: Weeelllll.... sounds okay, but if I can ever get my act together long
382 enough to sit at the keyboard for a few hours, I've got this jim-dandy of a
383 terminal program idea going.  Not much of it will be original, but it will be
384 in a package that is compatible with EVERYTHING, i.e. new punter protocol for
385 those boards that I haunt, the text line upload and tone autodialing of
386 MEBterm, etc.  A hodge-podge of my other programs, so to speak.

412 To: Ian MacHinery
413 From: 06 on behalf of the Archives Department
414 Subject: Errant Androids
415    Sir, as you can see from the report on your desk, your special-model IM
416 androids have caused a bit of a mess.  To explain, I shall have to relate
417 what I have gathered from the Robotics Department.
418    First, an android is very impressionable for the first few hours after
419 activation.  What it sees and hears can have a very strong effect on what it's
420 actions are.
421    From the evidence, I would say that these three androids were affected by
422 what they saw in your personal library after the transport vehicle broke down.
423 Perhaps stronger measures may be taken to prevent such occuring in the future.
424 The three items that the androids removed (a copy of Alice in Wonderland, 
425 Issue #94 of The Adventures of Bugs Bunny, and your Second-Annual Mr. T's
426 Super A-Team Coloring Book) have been replaced.  Only the small matter of 
427 damages to the main archives section remains, the damage of the other two 
428 androids being negligible.  The total is, sir, $17,393.68.  The bill will be
429 sent to you by the end of next week.
430  
431 Respectfully yours, 06.

437 
438 I drove my selective turbine driven jet pack down to the central station
439 on the space walker....and there was the ride i was waiting for. We rode
440 into Lynn Kirby XXXX used jets and she was right on the middle turntable...
441 as beautiful as ever! I stood in awe--open mouthed like I would have stepped
442 on my new welded grip dentures!
443 Anyway good ole' Lynn walked over <his face red like he just made a 3 million
444 spectocredit account that flew away like a prehistoric red-breasted robin!
445 and he said "boy you can't think of how much I'd like to sell you that...but
446 I don't think you're old enough."
447 "here's my ID."I said as I waved my digital age unit ion the tip of his nose.
448 "OKAY!!!" I'll tell you he lit up like a torch!!
449 I hopped in and revved the jets up...and the thing felt so good I wanted to 
450 go right then!!
451 First I threw my account spector at him and he stuck it on the side of the jet 
452 and poink! the cost was his!
453 OOPS!

483       Hey Mudge er Sranul er Cat er Zephyr...
484 I think it's pitiful that you got mad enough at digitalian to call pranks
485 on his mother (you must be the real low life). It's also pitiful that
486 when HE called you, you said that
487 Sysop had delaeted his entry about you. (Which is a FLAT DOWN lie)along with
488 everything else you say.
489 
490 You couldn't even admit yoou were Mudge, Zephyr.. etc.
491    I'm digitalian2 but now have changed my name. Digitalian(1) was Lone 
492 Ranger but will never use that name again. (We can admit it.. you cant)

496 Please write another TWIT Test.

527   looking over the device quite carefully, so as not to miss any detail,
528 the depictions on the exterior of the craft found me easily detained as i 
529 would contemplate the possible ramifacations of the scenes before my 
530 startled eyes.
531   another sneeze came from behind me, the sneeze of discomfort.  i turned 
532 to face trainor, asking if there would be anything i could do to make
533 the unpleasant situation any more bearable.
534   "nay, i believe i shall have to ride out this storm, whatever the cause
535 may be.  it all seems so confusing"
536   as i had turned to face trainor, the hooded shawl that covered the entire 
537 upper portion of my body was allowed to fall open in its place.  trainors
538 gaze met with the fine embroidery that decorated my sturdy tunic, there was
539 the unmistakable image of the standing lion, forward paws outstreched in mid
540 air.  frustraction of the inability to aid him made me turn back to his
541 splendid machine where i found zephyr.
542   "it is very much a shame that we won't be able to take along this fine 
543 animal," i commented to the crowd in general.  "i find it to be so...
544 so very beautiful.  do you know, zephyr my dear, that you have the smoothest
545 pelt that i have ever felt?"
546   "oh thank you very, very, very much fine lady!  i pride myself in the 
547 grooming of my fur, appearances are everything to us smaller creatures,
548 you know!"  the exclaimation uttered from the rabbit very happily as it 
549 twiched its warm ears.
550   "yes, very much a shame..."  i placed the rabbit with great care back 
551 down on the solid earth.  just then a strong gust of wind blew over the 
552 the crowd that had gathered outside the inn.  my shawl had been waved by 
553 this wind and had turned inside out.  the reason for its being so warm for
554 me was no longer hidden as a look of panic filled the gleam in zephyr's 
555 tiny eyes, the inside of my shawl lined with the skins of his brothers.
556 yes, it was so very warm now, even in this breeze.

565   The piper, keeping his eyes averted from some scenes that he found personally
566 rather too graphic (after all, shouldn't some things in life be left as
567 mysteries?), walked over to Trainor who seemed to be recovering from his fit
568 of sneezing.
569   "Isn't it about time we got going?" the piper asked.  "Your machine seems
570 to be attracting attention -- and one of the major things I have learned on
571 my adventures is that attention usually brings an unpleasant aftermath."

593 "It's all yours,"he said in a dreary grim voice...I didn't know what was up,
594 but something was fishy.
595 I really got worryied about him!
596 Anyway, I went home to sprite:1.
597 ">click< >r-r-r< What's up Digit?"he squeaked
598 His small but husky body wiggling as his Laser Discs flew in and out of place.
599 "You look discouraged"he said
600 I looked at him. He was a MESS!
601 "What happened to you, Sprite:1?" I asked.
602 He sat for a minute and clicked.
603      ">R-R-R-R< uhh...uhh..>click< he-he well...ummm"
604 He had guilt written all over his transistors...So I ran into the kitchen.
605         ***ARRGHHH***
