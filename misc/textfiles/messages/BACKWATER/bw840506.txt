41 whew,lost it a sec there,as you all can tell,I have returned to the

43 I knew.where for a non-existant gods sake is the fantasy? where's the dead

55 :**********************************************************:
56 Dear NEW MAN:
57 
58 Your best bet is to join the McKane organization. It is an 
59 organization dedicated to goodness, sanity, and the 
60 preservation of cute fuzzy animals. Assuming, of course, that 
61 the cute fuzzy animals are not gerbils or hamsters.
62 
63 The McKane organization was founded by the much respected and 
64 admired LeRoy McKane. Mr McKane is currently on business in 
65 either Columbia, Bulgaria, or Afganistan, I'm not certain
66 which. When he returns I am certain he will be able to help 
67 you in any way possible.
68 
69 
70                       Monsieur d'Autun
71 
72 P.S. - Do you have any special expertise in smuggling military 
73 equipment or hard drugs? The McKane organization is always 
74 looking for a few good men. 
75 
76 :************************************************************:
77 Monsieur d'Autun:
78 
79 Obviously you haven't heard the latest. LeRoy's gotten away 
80 from international drug smuggling and terrorism. Too much 
81 competition from the Albanian Revolutionary Party.
82 
83 It seems that LeRoy was so inspired by the religion debate at 
84 the Inn that he decided to go into a whole new business. As I 
85 understand it he has purchased a chain of monasteries that he 
86 will have pray for you for a fee.
87 
88 There are twelve monasteries, with 100 monks apiece, that will
89 pray for whatever you want. It cost $39.95 per monk, per day, 
90 to get prayed for. You get a discount if you hire a full 
91 monastery and bonus stamps if you hire all twelve.
92 
93 So, as you see, the McKane organization is continuing its 
94 effort to make the world a better place. This will, no doubt, 
95 be the hottest thing since LeRoy brought us Primal Belch 
96 Therapy.

115 don't know what it is like to go cold turkey off of Primal

117 everytime you start to belch they..... Oh... I can't tell

135 To DAMIEN II: it is my understanding that Mikey changes the disks when
136 DA is getting full, and he doesn't expect to be around when it is
137 actually full.  Rather than have DA fill up, leaving later users with
138 no room to write, he rotates it off.  DA, now DB, is still available
139 for further input.  It's just not the disk people go to first. (or sometimes

261 Boring.  These puzzles are getting easier.  If I understand right, your
262 coins puzzle specified that the false coins are light, so I will assume
263 that the scale I use can tell me the actual weight of the coins I weigh
264 instead of comparing them to something else. In that case:
265 Put one coin from stack 1 on the scale, followed by two from stack 2, etc.
266 until coins from all 10 stacks are on the scale.  Now determine how many
267 tenths of a gram (ounce, whatever) that the coins are light.  The number
268 of tenths lighter than normal (55 grams, oz, etc.)  is the number of the
269 pile of false coins.

308 TO HOAXER: You better check your facts, There definately is a group by that
309 name (Christian Youth Ministries) if you listened to PBS news last night you
310 would have heard of their holding a pray-in on the steps of the state capitol
311 and in Terry Shrunk park right here in Portland. I do not wish to be accused of
312 being any part of that movement nor, I'm sure would they want me as one of them.
313 This was the deep thought behind my decission to change my moniker here on our

330 Dear New Man:
331 
332 There recently was a slanderous item on BWS by someone calling 
333 himself "Another victum of LeRoy McKane". It's important that 
334 you understand that this is just another example of the 
335 heinous conspiracy to besmirch the respected name of McKane.
336 
337 Primal Belch Therapy is a revolutionary technique, created by 
338 Mr. McKane, to cure people of spiritual malaise. The person 
339 writing the slanderous message was warned of the dangers of 
340 undergoing Primal Belch Therapy while suffering from the 
341 hiccups. Not only was he warned by his instructor but the 
342 warning was clearly spelled out in the Primal Belch Starter 
343 Kit Manual. He ignored the warning and paid the price.
344 
345 I hope this spiteful person has not soured you on the many 
346 good works of the McKane organization. To demonstrate our 
347 good faith I am authorized to offer you a free pair of 
348 ear muffs with your application to join.
349 
350 I am looking forward to hearing from you.

356 Kudos to Aaron and Milchar, although Aaron (or is it aaron?) seemed
357 doubtful about his answer.   Yes, the single amoeba takes (took?)
358 3 hr 3 min to fill his (its?) jar.  After all, it only had to reproduce
359 once to reach the point that the pair started from, which only took
360 an extra 3 minutes.
361 ??????
362 No takers on the other number sequence?  Go back and take another look;
363 I gave 1 1/2 hints in its intro.
364 ?????
365 A new one (sorry if people think these are too easy, the more difficult
366 ones in my source are more visual therefore difficult to reproduce here).
367 Three boxes are labeled "Apples", "Oranges", and "Apples and Oranges".
368 Each label is incorrect.  You may select only one fruit from one box.
369 No feeling around or peeking is permitted!  How can you label each box
370 correctly?

378 QM: after withdrawing the fruit, you will have at least 1 apple and 1
379 orange. Placing these aside, pour into the apples&oranges box the contents
380 of the other 2 boxes. Now correctly place the reserved fruit into the 
381 corespondingly labeled boxes...                          Aaron
382 <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
383 Aaron, better go back and read the puzzle again.  You get to draw
384 one and only one fruit. One box contains only apples, one box contains
385 only oranges, and the third box has a mixture.  Or, where you making
386 a funny?  When I'm trying to be serious, I seem to lose my sense
387 of humor (did I really need those last two words?).
388 ???????????????????????????? QUIZMASTER ????????????????????????????
389 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
390 QM: Draw one fruit from the Apples & Oranges Box.  Label the box according to
391 what you draw out, placing the A&O label on tthe box you took the label from.
392 Now, switch the two labels (the A&O label and the fruit that WASN'T drawn from
393 t box.) Reason: All the boxes are mislabled, so the 'A&O' box CAN'T be A&O.

440 Mike: You might notice the large number of missing lines above. The space
441        was mostly returns with a few 'enters' mixed in.

444 Thank heavens (or whatever) that BWMS is still insane.  I haven't been around
445 for a while, and things have returned to abnormal in my absense.  I hope
446 the medieval science friction types remain lost!!!!

469 Milchar walks down the seemingly endless hallway, passing door after door in
470 search of the mystical door number 493.  He passes another dozen doors, and
471 finally finds the object of his search.  'The race is on!', he thinks to him-
472 self as he turns a diamond key in the lock.  He pushes open the massive door
473 and disappears inside, hidden by wisps of multi-colored fog just as the door
474 swings closed with a resounding boom.  Not that any could hear it....
475 'I just wish that the inside of this tower was smaller or just as big as the
476 outside', thinks Milchar.  'This needing a bag of maps to find the kitchen is
477 a little much for me to bear.'
478 He sits on the floor of the room he occupyies, within a pentagram of silver
479 fire.  Energy pours out of the 'gram, and seemingly fades into the fabric of
480 the multi-verse.  'I just love this new spell, "Monkey Wrench"'....

484 Aaron: No more funeywell backspaces! Alas the messages are a bit more
485 clear now! By the way, thanks for the pizza. Now that I have finally made
486 it back to the inn, or where ever we are, I got a chance to read the gerbil
487 message. All I can say is go choke on a piece of barkdust! Have you eaten
488 the MF&E candy bar yet? I picked up my new toy today, now about that cheap
489 modem you told me about... 47th & Division..all units are closing in
490 on that area. With the aid of a phone trace (remember the technique we talked
491 about at the party?), we are getting really close now. By the way, I got a
492 call from a lawyer today, wanting to know everything I knew about you,
493 your phone number, address, social contacts, DECUS membership number, so on.
494 I told him it would cost him, and he said he would call back later... Can you
495 pay me enough to keep me from spilling the beans to the lawyer??? Only time
496 and money will tell (of course a new uniform would do the trick)... Or
497 a plane ticket to Berkely...Lazer later whizard...

500 PS Milchar : Are you still on for a trade of spells. I have all these 3X5

505 L'homme: Of course I do.  Here's a sample of the particular type of spell
506 you want:
507 13.  'Sort by First Letter'
508 14.  'Sort by Astrological Sign'
509 15.  'Sort by Age of Tree the Paper was Made Of'
510 16.  'Sort by Age of the Jelly Stains on the Paper'
511 17.  'Sort by the "Random Order" Method'
512 If any of these spells will work, then we'll sort them and then we can excange
513 a few.  My books are bulky (some of them are not) but 3 x 5's are ridiculous.

523 It had only seemed like a moment, yet in the blink of an eye, 
524 it had changed from light to dark. The menicing storm was no 
525 longer apparent, leaving me drenched from its passing however. 
526 I look back to the door behind me, it is closed. I could have 
527 sworn that PAM had answered my knock, yet now she is not there. 
528 A very odd situation. Not knowing what has happened, I decide 
529 to simply try again. Grasping the post I pull myself up. 
530 Shivering from my cold wet clothes, I stagger to the door. 
531 Grasping the ornate knocker, I raise it and once again strike 
532 it three times. Or is this only the first time? Has my mind 
533 been playing tricks on me? I lean back against the wall beside 
534 the door. I hope that I can gain shelter here. No answer comes 
535 immediately. Slowly I slide down the wall to sit on the porch 
536 again my weak legs still unable to hold me errect. I think 
537 back, (how long ago was it?) in earlier more active times. That 
538 old war general who never seemed to get started at anything, 
539 and the young traveler I once met emerging from the woods. Why 
540 these people should stick in my mind I don't know. Perhaps It 
541 is because they were one of the few people I have met who were
542 willing to sit and talk with me. My mind wanders further, and I 
543 am walking down a tree shrouded path towards a building. Up 
544 ahead a stream bars my way but an old foot bridge provides safe 
545 crossing. Why does this bring such familar memories? Up ahead 
546 the building looms large. I aproach it and begin to open the 
547 door. As it creaks open, I suddenly realize that the sound is 
548 real, and turning my head I see that it is the door to the 
549 house that is opening. What will it hold for me?
550 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
551 I KNOW NOW THAT YOU FOLKS ARE CRAZY. EXCEPT THE APPLES AND THE ORANGES.
552 I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER YET BUT I SHALL
553 KEEP ON TRYING.

580 TO:PHEONIX!!!
581 Who might you be...?  I am /Z/ XENON /Z/, a friendf *COMPUTER RAT*
582 and have a similar proffesion, do I know you outside of the INN???
583 .......To:SEMI-NOVICE... I believe that the SANYO series or COLUMBIA
584 computers would be fitting for most anyone that doesn't plan to run a
585 ulti-million dollar business or a games computer... I have a Sanyo
586 MBC-555 computer with at least 200 programs... many of which are business
587 programs..(DBASE II, CYMA, et-cetera). I also do not work through a
588 sre
589 
590 enter
591 store, so I have lower prices.(will be determined by my associates)
592 I have at least 6 years of computer programming expierience, so I am
593 qualified enough to know a good computer when I see one... for instance
594 The COLUMBIA can run over 99% of IBM Software, and Hardware. It is pretty
595 much the same computer, except the COLUMBIA has more expansion capability,
596 and is more inexpensive.  I would have one except my budjet could only
597 afford a SANYO, which is about 70%  software compatible (with one single
598 sided disk drive, and a double sided drive). There is a Sanyo users
599 meeting at Van's Drive-In Restaraunt on 154th and N.E. Sandy blvd.
600 The metting starts at 11am, Van's serves breakfast and has a nice 
601 atmosphere...if you are interested, leave a message to XENON(on BWMS),
602 or Mark Vanalstyne on any other of the boards(PMS, PCS, WEST #1,T TIBBS,
603 or the Bit Bucket) to list a few of the most popular ones...(PUBLIC).
