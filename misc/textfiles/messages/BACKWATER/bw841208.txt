24 The walk down to The Department lasted about a half hour, but I was in no rush.
25 John wasn't expecting me, but then again he wasn't expecting the cash my 
26 clients gave me, either.  With all the waste in the government, a few items 
27 would never be missed.  John smiled at my request for weaponry, and asked,
28 "Gee, we've got an experimental gaget here, but it hasn't been 'acid tested'
29 yet.  Care to do the job?"  It started off just like that.  Sometimes I 
30 wondered if it should be me who gets paid for taking this stuff, not him.  
31 Anyway, the 'gadget' was this slick-lookin' rifle that had enough buttons on 
32 it to supply a coat manufacturer.  My eyes bugged out as he recited he specs on
33 the 'XD-40'.  Violent toy, that.  I took it.
34 Vehicles were a little harder to get, but after an hour of searching, John
35 and I found a slim job that looked like it could do 150, easy.  "What's the 
36 mileage on this sucker, anyway?", I asked.  John laughed, and said it used a
37 special fuel, and needed refueling about once a month if not abused.  "How long
38 if I abuse it HARD?", I asked, slipping into the driver's seat.  John reached 
39 in and pressed a sequence on the keypad inside.  The section on the dash that 
40 had the radio and defroster on it revolved to show a CRT, mike, and a speaker.
41 John proudly smiled as he told me this part was his contribution to this 
42 project.  Somehow I felt like I was starring in a second-rate prime-time TV 
43 show as the CRT flashed the locations of all police cars within 5 miles while 
44 at the same time reciting the officer's names through the speaker.  "Go ahead,
45 talk to it.", John said.  I felt stupid talking to a pile of IC's, but I said,
46 "Hello".
47 "Good morning, Farley.  John, will Farley be my new owner?"
48 "'Fraid so.  Listen, Farley, take good care of him.  He's my baby."
49 "What do I call your silicon son?", I asked, disgusted with the fact that
50 cars nowadays didn't just go fast, period.  Who needs this talking bit?
51 "Ah, er, I haven't named him.  Figure it out later.  Need anything else?"
52 I got out of the enunciating auto and rattled off a list of standard supplies.
53 John rounded the stuff up in no time.  I counted out the amount into John's 
54 open hand, got the manuals for all of my stuff, then waved goodbye as I drove
55 out of the shop.  
56 "Farley, I really need a name.  John put off naming me until I had an owner.
57 Well, what shall it be?", the car said.
58 I pushed down my instinct to punch the CRT and replied, "Come up with a name
59 for yourself."
60 That silenced the thing for a moment, and I was free to see how fast this thing
61 REALLY went.  140...150...160... hmmm, 170 seemed to be the limit.  That'll do.
62 "Er, Farley, would you like to know my name?", the car asked.
63 Sure, why not.  "Go ahead, tell me."
64 "Mr. Farley, my model number if FD-78, representing Fusion-Drive series 78.  I
65 shall use the FD in my name.  Call me Fred."
66 "Ok, Fred, can you run the steering in this thing?"
67 "Sure.  Anyplace in particular?"
68 "Yeah.  Antelope, Oregon.  About five miles out, not too close."
69 "Okay, just relax for a while.  Read the manuals."
70 "I just might do that, Fred.  Just keep to the driving, will you?"
71 I opened the first manual, and began reading about the items I would be using 
72 to find these people.  Cat-detector?!?  Ah, yes, that's right, one of those 
73 missing persons I was looking for was a cat.  Sigh.

93   I am truly sorry for the first story from Omega on the last disk. It was trash, and I am truly sorry, I had not read it till
94 now, and I apologize once again.
95 ===============================================================================
96 Geez!  What this board needs is more characters.  What are us newcomers supposedto do?
97 Oh well... thinking up wildly unlikely combination of characters should keep my
98 attention away from finals for a while longer...  
99 ---------
100      There is some talk that there will be a Dune series(after all, if George
101 Lucas could do it with Star Wars, we can make a mint, too, eh Bunkie?); is any-
102 one else as disturbed by this as I am?  I recall reading Dune for the first time--the sense of immersion in a totally remote
103 and unlikely universe that nevertheless rang true.  All that occurred was 
104 possible, and there was a sense of,of, of, rightness.  It was reality.  The nexttwo books, Children of Dune, and Dune Messiah,
105 lacked this.  (I must confess that I haven't read the other two sequels, for
106 fear of being disappointed once again) Can a writer go back and pick the bones
107 of past creations?  Or is the only reason I am so disillusioned is that the 
108 "great unwashed" discovered Dune, stole it away from us, the true believers?
109 Is money really worth that much?  Look at what it has done to poor Alan Dean
110 Foster--once a writer of minor genius, who could write "rollicking adventure" 
111 stories and now is doomed to write "movie tie-ins" for supermarket check-out
112 stands.  I don't know if I can stand to see Dune in the National Enquirer the
113 next time I buy coffee... Or how about the good doctor Asimov, now a carica-
114 ture of himself.  He seems determined to write more than any other human being
115 ever, and God help him, he seems to be succeeding...Why should anyone bother
116 wading through 300 books(I know most aren't SF) to separate the wheat from the
117 chaff?  Or Robert A. Heinlein...Bob, what you write was controversial 15 years
118 ago, but now...now it's sort of boring.  Oh well, I guess that those that can,
119 do, and those that can`t, criticize.  
120      In honor of finals week, readers are invited to compare and contrast

153      Just as a couple of off-duty Net agents were about to 
154 Leave their newly constructed headquarters out the 'covert'
155 back door that leads directly to the Tri Met Office on the
156 Pioneer Courthouse Square, they noticed a stange banging
157 noise at that door. Just as Rosewood was about to open the 
158 door, he asked Taggart, "Think we should leave out the other
159 door, Lieutenant?"    Taggart just shook his head and said,
160 "Naw, why bother? Besides, you know that the next exit back
161 is five minutes from here."     "I know, but..."
162 Before Rosewood could finish, Taggart edged his way in front
163 of him to look out the peephole to see what it was that was
164 making all the fuss.  Taggart put his mouth by the intercom
165 and said, "What do you want, kid? Deliveries to the restaurant
166 are made in the back, can't you read the sign?" Rosewood just
167 smiled.     "I don't want to get to the food place, I want to
168 get to the, um, uh, you know, the, um, er, well, the Net!"
169 Taggart looked back at Rosewood, whose mouth was now open.
170 "I said, deliveries are made in the back, kid. Beat it!"
171 "Aw, gee! You're no fun! I wanna come in and see all your neat
172 stuff and join the club and do weird things and wear funny
173 three-piece suits and look real important like you guys!"
174 Taggart was not impressed. Besides, he payed good money for
175 this suit. Rosewood just laughed,he knew a good joke when he
176 was one.     "So, you want to join the 'club' eh?"
177 "Yea, sure! That would be kind of neat! Come on, let me in!"
178 Lord, not another juvie thought Taggart as he wiped his face.
179 Rosewood tried to stop laughing and hit the intercom from 
180 where he stood "You want to get in? Right, that's easy! Just
181 make the headlines of the Oregonian."  He let go of the button
182 and laughed some more.          "Wow! What do you mean, blow
183 up a building or something?"    "No, you twit. Just do 
184 something really clever for once in your life...
185 Like going away!" Taggart added with a smirk on his face and 
186 peered out the peephole to see what brought on the sudden calm.
187 What he saw was the kid with a dumb look that matched Rosewood's.
188 The kid was pondering his solution. It looked like pondering
189 was difficult for him and made his brain hurt. Then from the quiet
190 the kid turned around and trotted towards his bus stop saying 
191 something to the effect of "Neat! My first assingment! Won't they
192 be impressed!"   Taggart turned back to Rosewood and said "Nice
193 going, airhead.  *YOU* get to explain tomorrows headline to the
194 Chief, not me. Come on, let's get out of here." Rosewood fixed
195 the ruffle of his tie and followed Taggart out the door unnoticed.

200   Well, we'll give it another try!
201     Picture, if you will, the Ruby valley after the party's departure.  They
202 had been none too neat about cleaning up the campsite -- their departure had
203 been unplanned and hasty.  A small campstove, long since run out of fuel,
204 a grill with an unidentifiable substance cooked into the metal, various plates
205 and eating utensils, covered with the remains of the last meal partaken there,
206 long since covered with mould, various personal items scattered where they
207 had been forgotten.  The sandy soil was scuffed from many feet, but the sharp
208 imprints were softened and rounded by the passage of time.  Only the hoofprints
209 of a large animal wandered through the campsite, ending in two deeply pressed
210 imprints as though the beast had flown away, were sharp and clearly marked.
211 As we speak of this, a small section of the wall of earth around the left
212 print crumbles and falls into the print, dimming its perfect outline.
213   At this time, the author of this mute evidence was soaring through strange
214 airs.  The pegasus' mind was burning with need to find the piper.  Somehow,
215 the emotional bond between them was giving her wild flight a direction.  
216   Normally a pegasus will avoid discontinuities in reality -- being of magical
217 metabolism, the risk of moving into a reality where magic does not work is
218 normally unsupportable.  Ignoring the clamorings of instinct, she deliberately
219 sought out those slight shimmerings in the air, plunging into the unknown
220 guided only by the pull of love.  
221   For the pegasus, there was none of the simple "pass me another reality,
222 please," that her human companions enjoyed.  The practice of any sort of
223 magic other than the simplest sort was beyond her capacity.  Her mind was 
224 simpler than that of those she sought, simpler and more clear.  She simply
225 sought out the instabilities in reality that she could reach, threading a 
226 multi-dimensional maze with singleminded determination.
227   If we were to imagine the branches of reality as a system of roads, and 
228 could look at a map, we would find blank areas -- roadless areas that seemed
229 to have no means of access.  Of course, as earthbound creatures, we ignore 
230 the aerial routes that winged creatures travel.  A map of the reality routes
231 to the Ruby Valley would show it as nearly inaccessable -- by ground transport.
232 The air routes are nearly nonexistant as well.  It took the pegasus long 
233 flying, and much effort to traverse the paths of reality from the Ruby valley.
234 A rider or companion would have been scarcely aware of the minute transitions
235 from one reality to the next.  Subtle changes -- the position of a tree limb,
236 a wilted flower where none had existed before, these subtle differences were
237 all that marked her early path.  However, as the distance from the Ruby valley
238 increased, the size and content of her reality shifts increased.  Just as 
239 myriad trickles gather into a stream and build into a raging river, the small
240 alterations in reality lead to realities that in turn are easier to alter.
241 Beneath her outstreched wings, the landscape began to change and mutate.  The
242 pegasus' internal reality-sense was buffeted by the change,  helping only
243 to allow her to seek more mutable realities.  Now the landscape seemed to 
244 writhe and crawl beneath her.  Forests died and grew, gripping the land in 
245 tentacles of green, shading into black, then crimson.  The very land began to
246 soften and shift beneath her, moulded as though by the grip of the mutating
247 vegitation.  Suddenly, the land beneath her began to rise, carrying with it
248 the rapidly changing life forms that flickered through the frames of reality.
249 The land seemed to gather its strength, then bunched up and thrust a huge
250 block of rock and earth skyward, as though to block her progress.  Banking 
251 sharply, she avoided the sheer rock wall that had appeared in her path,
252 and still chosing paths that led to still stranger realities penetrated a cloud
253 that smelled strangely of cinnamon.

259 Voyeur:I read another 'industry magazine' about Dune. It seems as if the

281 Piper; keep that sort of writing up and you'll attract publishers.  No, really, keep up the good work, you set a good

283 L'homme; NOT funny.  I'll tolerate the Commodore jokes after I get something 'better'.  Doesn't seem like it's going
284 to happen soon, though.  Anyway, I went to Tom's yesterday and he said I wouldn't be needed until the 29th... yes, that
285 means (gasp) that next Saturday will be the second PorSFiS meeting I have attended in a row.  I'll have to miss the 
286 following one, but such is life.  Also, rumor has it that The Doctor finally went and begged hard enough for his disk
287 drive.  Watch out, this could be a potentially dangerous situation.

289 I slowly moved the shard higher, not wanting us to be crushed on whatever lay in store for us at the top.  Dimly, I
290 could see the uppermost portion of the shaft.  It was illuminated on one side by a door of some sort.  After another
291 minute of painstaking movement of the shard, we were level with the doorway.  Bright light spilled out from the 
292 corridor beyond.  I motioned for everyone else to get into the corridor, for breaking the binding might get a little 
293 hazardous.  Gesturing quickly, I began the ritual to sever the connection.  Abruptly, It was done.  The shard fell to
294 floor as I dove for the doorway.
295 Clang.  The sound echoed in my mind as I slid to a stop in the corridor.  The floor behind us had been indeed meant to
296 hit the ceiling of the shaft.  Ah, but now we could see the true purpose of the floor.  It was the ceiling for the 
297 actual elevator compartment itself.  We had, unwittingly, boarded the elevator one floor *ABOVE* where the real 
298 compartment was.  The elevator itself was carrying a single passenger, who strode by us without seeming to know we were
299 there at all.  He wore a few magical symbols upon his clothing but I recognised none of them.  He vanished around a 
300 corner before anyone could react.
301 Bard signaled to the rest of us and we all dashed down the hallway, following our quarry.  Rounding the corner, we saw 
302 the hall continue for ten more feet and then abruptly quit.
303 +++++++++++++++++++++++
304 I cursed my bad luck as the sliding section of wall closed just before I could follow them in.  With no other visible
305 means of entry, I could follow no further.  Why did Milchar seem to have all the luck?  I worked just as hard, nay, 
306 harder than he did.  I grumbled as the spells wore off, and I became visible once more.  Nothing do do now but search
307 for another way in.  What would work...?  I thought about it for about five minutes, then an idea struck me.
308 I dug around in the earth about me until I discovered a small amount of clay.  Scooping a bit of it into my hand, I 
309 molded it into a likeness of the citidel.  I recited the words necessary, then set the model down upon the ground.
310 Next, I hunted about my robes until I discovered my magifying glass.  I polished it up a bit then picked up the model
311 and began a methodical search of its surface.  A full twenty minutes had gone by before I saw the dim outline of an 
312 opening.  Calculating quickly, I determined that it was located about 1/3rd about the base of the citidel.  Putting the
313 glass and the model away, I strode toward the only hope of gaining entry into the tremendous tower.

318   The Other was spooling out the detonation wire, and wrapping it slowly around the Cobalt charge. Perhaps he was crying, I do
319 no know.
320   Stabbing the two pronged detonator cap into place, he wiped dust and perhaps tears from his face using a scratchy woolen
321 shirt sleeve. Sitting back on his legs, he surveyed the explosive charge he had just readied.
322  
323   A voice from deep inside the gloom complementted his handywork, and the Other turned to see who had spoken.
324   Omega stepped from the darkness, and met for the first time, himself. An experience he would not wish upon his dearest enemy
325 or freind.
326 
327   Other simply knelt where he was, stunned, frightened, afraid. Reassured by the fact that Omega had to feel the same way.
328   Except Omega had been adjusting to this strange inconsistancy for at least thirty minutes, just watching the other.
329 
330   "I was wondering when you would try something like this, a bushwacking I beleive it was."
331   "I suppose you have already checked with the newspapers for the important events that could tell you whether you are in my
332 reality,  or if I am in yours."
333   "I am stranded in your reality as it were, and since I am, and have no way back to my own, I need you. And I think you need
334 me."atisfied with this, Omega made way tothe small table that was the only furnishing, and sat down.
335 
336   "Why would I need you, on the contrary, enemy. I need to kill you. Since we are the same, I can no more insure my position
337 with Net than I can be sure that you wont try to take Sarah away from me." Tears welled up in huis eyes at this.
338 
339   "My Sarah is dead, I must accept that, and I think I already have. I am not a theif, no more than you are, but Sarah is dead
340 at least to me. I would not take her from you."
341 
342   "I do not accept that. I might steal her from you, were I in the same position, and that is proof that you would. We are the
343 same, remember?"
344 
345   "Weare the same! That is the pont, we have not diverged from each other yet! In time with the accumulation of new experience
346 and knowledge we will be different, but right now every part of us is the same. Example one, for your benefit." With this,
347 Omega forced himself to throw his mid-forearm against a corner of a crate. It almost broke.
348 
349   "Arghhhhh!" The Other was reeling on the floor, having taken an unexpected blow of such force and pain. Other was screaming.
350   Omega simply stood there, rarely letting his pain form in the shape of a terrifying grimace of agony.
351 
352   "We are the same! If I took Sarah from you, I would feel all the pain, I would feel the pain, and I know the pain already. I
353 would not, could not do that to you. You don't deserve it." A very simple, truthful tone in Omega's voice convinced the Other.
354 
355   "The Bhagwan, what is his condition in this universe?" Asked Omega.
356   "He is dead, two months now, of a very rare and hidden condition. He never knew he had it."
357   "What are the Neeshies doing now?" Asked Omega.
358   "All of them are in mourning, the entire Puram is a fortress, no one goes in and no one gets out. The National Guard is at
359 alert staus, and the Net is coordinating all intelligence from inside."
360 
361   "What do they call the condition? And what is the cure?"
362   "Xenopolycythemia, and the cure is radiation therapy, but the therapy and the disease end up wiping the brain clear. You're
363 a vegetable, but at least your alive, in a way."
364 
365   "Okay, thanks I wish we had time, but I think I oughtto be going. I will take care, and contact you again in a few days."
366 
367   "I trust you." Said the Other in a sincere (Even if it was humorous) voice. He continues "I'll take care too."

375 but you seem to be heading off on a tangent.  That's fine.  But, in the

385 with the proper connections?  At least, someone should have the
386 opportunity to edit the archive disks and make some kind of hard-copy

395   Joshua, you are indeed in my former reality, and I am somehow left alone in another continuum.
396   No problem, eventually I may find my way back to our reality and save the Bhagwan with the knowledge of his hidden conditon,
397 at the expense of his foothold on Oregon. At least that's the theory, but my theories never seem to work out.

407 _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
408 	I bet on Christmas eve, headhunter children have visions of heads dancing in their heads.
409 	I think a nice Christmas present to the Russians would be to launch about a thousand missles, only they're all
410 duds and they're filled with candy. Nice surprise, eh?
411 	Like many others of his generation, Todd had been raised to believe he was invulnerable to dynamite. Todd has
412 some growing up to do, and also some blowing up to do.
413 	Too bad bees don't make lead instead of honey, because I bet the best cannonballs would be made out of bee lead.
414 	As I look out my window, I am surprised at the different shapes I can see in the clouds. One looks like a big
415 mound of cotton; another looks like a big mound of cotton candy; and still another looks like a big fluffy "thing."
416 	If you're a horse, and someone gets on you, and falls off, and then gets back on you, I think you should buck
417 him off right away.
418 	Luck is more important than many of us realize. For instance, Rembrandt was lucky that just about all the
419 paintings he did were good.
420 	Instead of putting blindfolds on the guys getting executed, let's put them on the guys with rifles. Good idea, eh?!
421 That way, if you shoot, and you hear somebody yell, did you hit the prisoner or one of the other rifle guys? And did
422 you get shot too? What suspense!
423 	Many people never stop to realize that a tree is a living thing, not that different from a tall, leafy dog that
424 has roots and is very quite.
425 	If someone told me it wasn't "fashionable" to talk about freedom, I think I'd just have to look at him square in
426 the eye and say, "Okay, then you tell me what's 'fashionable.'" But he won't. And you know why? Because you can`t ask
427 someone what's fashionable in a smart-alecky way like that. You have to be friendly and say, "By the way, what's
428 fashionable?"
429 	If there's any lesson to be learned from war, I hope it's short. (There's too much memorizing as it is!)

511 We were only about halfway to Antelope when I nodded off, but now Fred tells me
512 that we're only twenty miles out.  Time to earn my keep, so the saying goes.
513 I crammed as much as I could into a backpack, then suited up for the weather.
514 Fred kept telling me to be careful and that he didn't want to be stranded way
515 out here as I finished tieing my shoelaces.  "I'll be fine.", I grumbled,
516 disgusted with the fraidy-cat car.
517 "Are you sure?  I'll keep a scan on you anyway, just to make sure.", Fred said.
518 "Never mind that, just give me a fix on the fugitives.  Forget the cat for now,
519 how about the other guy?"
520 Fred was silent for about half a minute before he replied.  "About 10 miles
521 west-northwest of the Puram...  2 miles from our current position, a pile of 
522 wreckage from a helicopter.  The only place he could be.  Hmmm, a beacon of 
523 some sort, also.  A coded pulse-type.  It'll take some time to decipher."
524 "Work on it while I'm gone.  Pull off the road and into some cover.  Wipe the 
525 snow-tracks behind you.  I'll be back in two hours, all right?"
526 "Okay.  Bye, Farley.  Say, is that your first name or your last?"
527 "My last.  Don't ask what my first name is, I won't tell you."
528 "Really.  I'll find out, somehow.  It'll be something else to occupy my time."
529 "Go ahead.  I've been REAL careful about my name.  See if you can find out
530 what it is."
531 I got out of the car, then palm-locked it.  I had a long walk in front of me,
532 but I figured I could test some of the stuff on the way.  I began to hum to 
533 myself as I melted into the surroundings, gone from view.  Light-sensitive 
534 camoflauge suit that shielded heat emission and all.  God, what gadgets.  I 
535 felt like...like... one of those NET agents you hear rumors about.  I smiled at
536 the similarity between me and that fictional group...

540 L'homme: yes, I had heard that story about the Dune previews.  I myself am
541 expecting to be somewhat disappointed.  And yes, I saw the Siskel & Ebert review
542 (just finished watching it, in fact).  I felt that Ebert (chubby) had the wrong
543 view of the movie.  He was comparing it with contemporary films like Star Wars and
544 Star Trek.  I don't see it that way myself; while the special effects were nice,
545 they should have been secondary to the story.  I compare it more with 
546 its predecessor 2001, and in that I feel it failed.  Siskel had more of
547 the right idea, and I agreed with some of what he said, such as the trip
548 from the Russian ship to Discovery being Much too long, since you KNOW they
549 are going to have to get there.

573   The Former was sitting thoughtfully, and gnawing at a long, slender green leaf, looking quite sad about something. A sapient
574 lady walked up to his table and asked him what was the matter with him.
575 
576   Thoughtfully he blinked his eyes open for a moment, looking at the lady quite momentarily indeed. Soon he took an expression
577 of utter tiredness, and shut his eyes immediately. Quite whimsical, but hell to get information out of.
578 
579   The Former sadly explained in mournfull tones how someone named Milch was being forgotten by almost all of those present. It
580 seems that this Milch and a 'Rag Tag Fugitive Force' as he explainedi it, had left the Inn quite some time ago.
581 
582   They were all hot and bothered to solve some mystery it seems, but they have left everyone else sitting with nothing to do.
583   Of course things started to happen every which way, but now, no one will tell the Former about how Milch and his band are
