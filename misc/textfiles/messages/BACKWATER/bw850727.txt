20 Voyuer: Further along, it now communicates sort of.... two bugs still,
21 one in the 2000, and one in CL+. The one in CL+ is that when you tell
22 the modem to hangup, the program dies. The bug in the 2000 is that when
23 the screen scrolls, it uses the next attribute I write to the screen 
24 with instead of the one I told it to use. I think I can work around that,
25 I still don't know what the problem is with the hangup. 
26 L'homme: If you're listening, I'm now turning off the cursor before updating
27 the clock, (it was bugging me, so I spent the time to impliment the code
28 to do so.)

32 Cistop: so, at least Copylink (kinda) works.  If you don't mind reloading
33 after each call, it's a one-shot program. (so make the most of the
34 connections you make).  I'm really glad to know that you are able to work
35 around Tandy's ideosyncracies and lack of data. (thank god for the Sanyo, eh?)
36    I'm looking forward to getting my machine back, (not to mention CL).
37 This Model 1 is a nice place to (re)visit, but I DON'T want to live here.

44    "I will not leave here until I know the truth! What does this man mean to
45 you Mary? Do I still mean anything to you? Have we lost everything we once had?"
46 The voice erupted over the intercom speaker, but even cheap Asian electronics
47 could not hide the emotion that went into the plea.
48    "That's Kosta's voice!", cried agent Parity, as he too reached for his
49 weapon. "In we go Fellows."
50    The two agents burst into the inner office, the room they knew had to be
51 at the other end of the intercom they had listened to. There against one
52 wall stood a petite, strikingly beautiful woman, wearing a smart pink
53 chiffon dress. Next to her stood Mr. BMW. Parity could spot the look in a
54 second, dark glasses pushed up on tanned forehead, Izods and Botany 500
55 completing the wardrobe. The man currently doing all of the talking was one
56 agent Kosta, formerly with NET, now gone in to business for himself. As the
57 door crashed from its hinges, Kosta swung around, quickly drawn gun in hand.
58 Fortunately agent Fellows was just a bit faster, for in the blink of an eye
59 Kosta was disarmed and Parity and Fellows had everyone covered. The nosey
60 secretary from the outer office peeked in, saw the situation, and ran screaming
61 from the room.
62    "Don't worry. Farley will pick her up and bring her back" said Fellows.
63    "So you thought you were safe, eh Kosta?" queried Parity. "You thought we
64 fell victim to a well-placed C-bomb. You were wrong, and now you are going to
65 be sorry too."
66    "Uh, er, L'homme? I didn't know it was you! I swear!" There was panic in
67 Kosta's voice. "Someone was following me. I didn't know they would send you
68 after me so soon. Ian has more gumption than I thought. You must know I would
69 never try to kill an old accomplice like yourself. I hardly know Fellows and
70 Farley, above them being capable agents. I have forgiven you for taking me
71 away from Mary so long ago. Please L'homme!"
72    At this Miss Mary Lamb broke into tears. Shrugging the hold Mr. BMW had on
73 her, she ran across the room at L'homme, crying and screaming. Parity swung
74 around to meet her, and grabbed her shoulder before clawing hands could reach
75 his face. "I did not realize the consequences of my actions then." His voice
76 seemed to crack. "I didn't know how much...how much you meant to each other."
77    Mary crumpled at these words, sobbing, her whole body shaking with grief
78 and sorrow. She looked up at L'homme, and then at Kosta. Her words came out
79 slowly but with gathering strength. "You...didn't...have to go, did you?
80 Couldn't you have stayed here with me? I thought you loved me...I thought
81 you loved me!!!"
82    Her head sunk again, and the other factor, Mr. BMW, went to her side and
83 carefully lifted Mary to her feet. "It's all over Mary. Please Mary, Kosta
84 is going away now," and then to the NET agents, "isn't he?"
85    "Yes..." started Fellows, before Parity cut him off.
86    "Kosta must come with us. But I see now the terrible ramifications of what
87 I did so many years ago. I must tell you, I can't keep it in any longer. Part
88 of my choosing Kosta was for his skill, and part was because I was jealous of
89 his relationship with you Mary. Kosta told me much about you, but I guess I
90 could never relate to your relationship because I was without one myself. We
91 all have a dark side in ourselves, and mine chose that particular time to
92 surface. I have made a mistake that I can never make up for. I have come
93 between two people who obviously loved each other. I have transcended the bonds
94 of our agency through my own weaknesses. For that I will give you a little
95 more time together. I realize it is like a drop of water in a dry sea-bed,
96 but it is all I can do. Kosta, I must have your word, your word on our
97 friendship, for I too forgive you for your wayward attempt at murder, that
98 you will not try to escape. Fellows and I will wait outside, along with
99 this other gentleman. Take as much time as you need, and then we must be off."
100     "I am not going anywhere without Mary, and I am certainly not going to
101 leave her alone with this madman!" Mr. BMW roared. But his cries were cut
102 short by a well-placed hold applied by a stern-faced Fellows. The two agents
103 and the angry suitor left the room and retired to the outer office, leaving
104 Mary and Kosta alone to settle whatever had to be settled.

108 PS: Mikey: I think that will look much better. Bad news on the VT100 graphics.
109     It appears that no one knows anything about them because no one uses or
110     writes special programs that utilize them. When I say no one I of course
111     mean no one I can find at Tek or at PSU. Since one of the beauties of
112     UNIX is its ability to operate with a truckload of different terminals,
113     all using the special termcaps, software written for the VT100 in
114     particular would not have very universal applications. If we could find
115     someone who was doing a special project that involved a VT100, we might
116     be in luck. Unfortunately I have not been able to find this elusive
117     person. I have already talked to several knowledgeable people on this
118     without any luck. Any ideas?

166 COPYLINK BAD NEWS REPORT: Mikey: Copylink does NOT work on a standard IBM
167 PCjr with 128k. The program begins loading and then locks the machine up,
168 requiring a cold boot to get control again. I imagine it is a memory 
169 problem, because a jr with 128k has only 89k free memory according to CHKDSK.
170 I do not have access to a jr with more than 128k, so this is only conjecture.
171 Copylink 2.41 works fine. Does the memory problem make sense to you? Any
172 ideas on this too?
173 Leonard:Yes compuserve runs VT100, that is what I use when I log on to the

183 L'homme: Ack! I don't know what the problem might be, CL+ only needs
184 about 75K to run. And, too, if it was too large for the DOS, the dos
185 should say so, and if there isn't enough space for CL+'s buffers, it
186 will say so. As such, you should get SOME error message from someplace.
187 Hmmm, does the PCjr have a system clock? There is one thing about CL+,
188 when it first loads, it looks at the system clock, and waits for one
189 second to pass before continuing. It does this to find out the computation
190 speed of the system so that it can adapt its internal software timer.
191 The other thing is that it needs something at com1 when it comes up
192 since that is where it is normally configured unless it was reconfigured
193 for com2. That's about the only thing I can think of. Hmm, maybe I better
194 check on that system clock thing, that could be nasty on systems that 
195 don't have one....
196 
197 Voyuer: The screen problem is fixed now, so all that's left is the 
198 hangup problem. I got a feeling that IT isn't going to be as easy to 
199 find.

243     It all started one day when my Social Studies class was studing a news 
244 paper. HEADLINE "Russians Launch Fleet  of Nuclear Subs...
245 " 
246     The article was all about atomic subs and how 1 of them could send
247 the world into a nuclear winter. Just one! The class dicused what to do about
248 it. I was paticularly suprized at the amount of power each sub had.
249     For the rest of the day I was thinking about it. What could I do to save
250 myself if there was a war. I thought about the planets in the solar system
251 and if any could support human life. None would. Mars had too thin of an 
252 atmosphere, venus was to hot (600 degrees average) and the rest of the
253 planets hardly had any atmosphere either. Venus could probably be changed 
254 but it would take a long time to get there.

278 While it's nice to think that only one sub could send the world into
279 a nuclear winter, it is hardly based in fact. The best it might do is
280 to drop the temp a couple of degrees, hardly enough to plunge the 
281 world into a devistating winter. Also, the effects vary radically
282 depending on the conditions at the time. Summer would be a much worse
283 time then winter, since the needed fire materials will be much easier
284 to set off. Look at what happens with forest fires, they are almost
285 unheard off in the winter, but come summer, and they are all over.
286 Fire follows the same rules, no matter what starts it. Weather has a
287 lot to do with it as well. If it is raining, the fire isn't going to 
288 be as easy to maintain itself. Clouds are going to inhibit the progress 
289 of any smoke that might go up. Another aspect that some try to proport,
290 is that all the fuel dumps will go up at the first indication of an
291 atmomic blast. Poppy-cock! The problem of fire-strorms being created
292 by a fuel depo going up is hardly new, and much has been done to 
293 inhibit the possiblity from happening. Since it doesn't take a nuclear
294 blast to set one off, a lot of things can and have. I wouldn't worry 
295 all that much about gas stations, there is a reason why the stuff is
296 stored in underground tanks. It's the tank farms that have the tanks 
297 above ground that will be a problem, but even there the have to be ruptured,
298 or be exposed to a rather intense heat to blow them up. We're talking
299 an average bomb within a mile or two here. Also, you might be interested
300 to know that the figures that Carl Sagan and friends used to arive at
301 the results they did were considered 'absolute worst case' as well as
302 they ignored many of the inhibiting factors such as weather and terrain.
303 Nor did they chose a normal expected drop pattern, but rather a wide
304 spread in the worst possible areas they could determine. The end result
305 of all this is that yes there would probalbly be a reduction in temperature,
306 but not anywhere near the prediction of Carl and friends, and definately
307 not as long. A few weeks instead of months. They did the standard things
308 a scientist will do to project into an area he knows nothing about,
309 linear projection despite that time and time again it has been proven 
310 over an over that nature does not work that way. There have also been
311 tests that have proven that particals that do get into statasphere will
312 rain out, and not stay there indefinately as Carl and friends say.
313 
314      In short, it is not the nuclear winter that is so grossly overstated
315 of late that I worry about, it is the disruption of services, esential
316 operations, transport of food, contamination of water and land. And of
317 course the 50/50 chance that I'll be in the wrong place at the wrong
318 time when the thing goes off. The nuclear winter thing is largly a 
319 nightmare dreamed up by Carl and friends to try to scare the populance
320 into submission. I don't like being lied to, and if he'll lie to me
321 about his figures, how much else can I belive what he says?
322 
323 I don't like the concept of nuclear war, but I don't like being lied
324 to either. Nuclear war is insane, but so is thinking you can get away
325 with lieing. Beware Carl and friends, it will catch up with you in the
326 end.

330 L'homme: Hmm interesting, I don't know, possibly it would hang if there wasn't
331 anything at the comm port. I do know that the PCjr's RS232 port is always at
332 the hardware com2 location (it is relocated in software depending on whether
333 you have the modem installed or not. But since COPYLINK doesn't go through DOS,
334 it doesn't care what it does. Anyway, maybe if you were to reconfigure CL+ to
335 come up as com2 (give the command "MODEM 2" then CUSTOM) and try it again?
336 That should indicate if it will run right. Fun stuff there eh? If COPYLINK
337 will run, CL+ should run (where have you heard that before?) but they are
338 very different in how they work with the machines, so there is always the
339 posiblity of something going wrong... By the way, you need to pick up an
340 updated version of CL+ sometime too, or would you rather I sent it to you?

372   Dark Dragon sipped his wine, as he sat across from another man.  Dark 
373 Dragon'S name fit him well, as he was garbed in all black, and it was
374 not a usual pblack, it had an unnerving quality that see,med to warp 
375 any light that dared intrude upon it.  His black gloved hand touching the
376 transparent glass, raising it to his lips.  His features, although masked 
377 partly by the dim light of the room, were ddeeep. His narrow icy blue 
378 eyes seemed to be staring across the room, through the other man, and ths
379 caused the second man to shudder.
380   The other man swas about 20, blonde hair and a set of bushy eyebrows t
381 that nearly shadowed his face.  His green eyes looked deeply and intently
382 at Dark Dragon., never taking his eyes off of the black garbed gman as he
383 slowly, as if it were some great task, drank the glass of wine he had 
384 ordered earlier. 
385   "TIs that wine 1675?" asked the blonde man, eyeing Dark Dragon as he 
386 drank.
387   "No, but you can try a sip."
388   "Good, I'll do that, but first what of the sky."
389   "It's green."
390   The men finished the coded passwords and smiled at each other.
391   Z"Nice to see you again Russel."
392   "You too, D.D."
393   "Dark Dragon, please.
394   "Oh."
395   "Besides, now isn't the time to get all sentimental! This is, after all
396 is said and done, a business meeting."
397   "I know. I know. Do you have them?"
398   "Yes."
399   "You're sure??"
400   "Aren't I allways?"
401   "Yes, and it annoys me to heck!"
402    Dark Dragon curved his hand upward, seemingly sending shards of light 
403 screaming away with his black glove. He pulled from beneath the glove, a
404 after looking around, a small devi, or rathrrer a set.
405    Russel smiled at them. "Perfect miniatures."
406    "Yes, if you call something like that "perfect"
407    "I do, and remember, D.D..."
408    "Dark DRAGON!" sneered Dark Dragon.
409    "Whatever, remember that thiere isn't room for *peace thoughts* now!"
410    "Believe me , I know."
411    Dark Dragon glared at the blonde man, his eyes making Russel shudder.

442   The piper looked around the inn.  Where were those quest-bound souls who
443 should be planning with wild enthusiasm?  The flickering light of the open
444 fire illuminated the dark reaches of the inn's common room fitfully and faintly
445 with dim fingers of light, combing the encroaching shadows in search of
446 folks ripe for adventure.

458 Irrate war hater: At least we know where Carl Sagan came by his figures and

460 Perhaps, I am too trusting of the man who has told me about billion and 
461 billion of stars... But, I have read many of his books in fields other than
462 astronomy, and they seemed worthy enough. To me, you sound like nothing 
463 more than one of these people so commonly found here that is attacking some
464 figure for the sake of debate. It is very likely that you are not so. But,
465 for what reason should I believe that? You have given no evidence to back
466 your claim. Even if in truth, there would be holes in your arguement.

484 Obviously, you're not interested in debating the matter, accepting what
485 Carl says as truth without looking into the underlaying figures and 
486 components that he used. a well, such as it is.  I admit that I took an
487 extrem aproach to the subject, but I also still feel after looking at
488 both sides of the story, that Carl and friends theory leaves a lot of
489 questions in my mind too many assumtions and adjustments to the facts
490 were made to make things the way they wanted them to turn out. For a
491 good summary on the oposition, get a hold of the may 85 issue of 
492 Reason magazine. Of course you will also want to read the August 84 (83?)
493 issue of Scientific American for Carl and friends side of the story.
494 Never assume you know everything about a subject unless you have read
495 both sides of the issue. I have had my conclusions changed before simply
496 by allowing the alternate view as a possiblity.

500 Voyeur:  This  was written on the Tandy 2000 using WordStar,  and 
501 then  uploaded to BW with COPYLINK PLUS.  Of course you  probably 
502 know what that means don't you?  It WORKS!     <ahem>
503 
504      The  hangup bug turned out to be a two year old  hidden  bug 
505 that  decided to raise its ugly head on the 2000.  It seems  that 
506 given  a  certain set of circumstances that the RTS line will  be 
507 dropped when the hangup is initiated. Since the cable I was using 
508 had  RTS  tied back to CTS,  that caused the machine to  lock  up 
509 because  it didn't have the CTS on to allow it  to  transmit.  he 
510 funny part about it is that had I tried it with a real live modem 
511 I  never  would have had the problem since I use a ribbon  cable, 
512 which  would have properly suppied the CTS signal from the  modem 
513 regardless of the condition of the RTS signal.  Thus the  problem 
514 would have been there,  and I never would have seen it.  Instead, 
515 it  never  got  past the first stage of modem  emulation  running 
516 against the Sanyo. 
517      So  anyway,  it  is  all done now,  I'm in  the  process  of 
518 cleaning things up here, and it should be done by tommorow. 
519 
520 P.S.  I'll include a disk full of utilities for the 2000 for  you 
521 as well, a bunch of misc files including a ram disk program.

525  "AAAAACHHHHEEEEWWW!!!" Trainor sneezed like no one at Inisfal had ever
526 seen before.
527     "KAAAZUUNHITE!!!" several patrons responded.
528     "I am sorry, I don't know what <sneeze> has come over me! Our race of
529 <sneeze> people usually don't suffer from these <sneeze> irritating <sneeze>
530 ventilation problems <sneeze>."
531     The last sneeze caused the rabbit sitting on Trainor's shoulder to bound
532 to the other side of the room. It seemed the more distance between Trainor's
533 nose and the rabbit's hide, the less severe the sneezing attack became.
534     "Haha!" chortled one partially drunk inn-goer. "Trainor doesn't get along
535 with rabbits! And such a pretty rabbit too."
536     Trainor looked sullen. "I am afraid that man is correct. We didn't have
537 such animals in our land. I must be allergic to its fur. I'm afraid to tell
538 you this Zepher, but I would rather not go sneezing my way from reality to
539 reality in the Pell-mell. Speaking of the Pell-mell. Let me give you a tour
540 of my fine machine, and we can make final plans for our quest."
541     Trainor tossed the innkeeper an odd-fashioned coin, which the friendly
542 bar-man caught with the greatest dexterity. In a quick jump Trainor departed
543 the Inn. Several seasoned-looking adventures followed, including Bard, Piper,
544 Emu, and Scarlet Lion.
545     "This, my companions, is a Pell-mell." A sweep of Trainor's arm encompassed
546 a view of the entire machine, from ornate hood to baroque cockpit. "Yes, isn't
547 she a beauty!" Trainor was obviously proud of the machine. Unfortunately,
548 Trainor's taste is trans-reality devices left a little to be desired with the
549 other adventurers.
550     "Ah, ya, nice." said Emu.
551     "How...lovely." chimed in Scarlet Lion.
552     "Ha..ah, yes, quite lovely. Fine lines." continued Bard.
553     "It certainly is an interesting looking device." piper added
554 diplomatically.
555     "I knew you would like it!" said Trainor, oblivious to the cautious
556 comments from his new-found friends, friends who were above hurting Trainor's
557 feelings with true sentiments.
558     "And now...", started Trainor.
559     "The Adventure!" the others finished.

570 IRATE WAR HATER, ETC.: Whether there is a severe nuclear winter or not,
571 the fact remains that normal human life on our earth will be ruined. 
572 Did you see 'Testament' ?  No nuclear winter occurred, but things weren't
573 exactly wonderful. The point is to make sure that a nuclear war NEVER 
574 happens again (Hiroshima and Nagasaki still suffer) if we care at all
575 about any Terrestrian life forms.

580 That's the price for the prosperity that they enjoy today.
581 Don't worry too much about life forms.  They could take care of
582 themselves.  Have you been previously a dinosaur? Then, you should
583 be grateful that your life has been "ruined"! That way you were
