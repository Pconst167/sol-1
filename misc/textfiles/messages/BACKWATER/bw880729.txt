 28 As I was being dragged towards the kitchen by the barkeep a man called
 29 out and I was released.
 30  
 31      "Thank you very much, It would not have been in your best interest
 32 to subject a member of the Inter Dimensional Police to the sorts
 33 of indignaties you were contemplating." I said to him. I chased down
 34 one of the patrons and got a clearer picture of what going on.
 35      "So, you say a man in black robes stole a Pie?" I asked him.
 36 He noded vigoresly. "Well, we can have none of that. I shall have
 37 to do somthing about this. "You haven't seen a little gray tube
 38 have you?" I said to him, but he seemed to be gone.
 39  
 40      I was unfortunetly without a means of transport, but I couldn't
 41 let this Pie steeler go unpunished.
 42  
 43      "Hey, you. Stupid!" I heard a voice say. "Yeah, you. The one in
 44 the bathrobe." I turned around looking for the source of the voice.
 45 "Over here you idiot. Look in the tub."
 46      I walked over to the tub an looked inside. It was only then
 47 that I noticed the small brown man in the bottom. "Whats the 
 48 matter, Never seen a brownie before? get over here, I've got
 49 somthing for you."
 50  
 51      "Now listen here..." I began, but again the small brown man
 52 interuptted me. "No, You listen. The chief sent me out here to tell
 53 you that the tub is a fully equiped model 65-g, You do no what that
 54 is dont you?"
 55  
 56      "Yes..." "good, he also told me to tell you to be sure to follow
 57 your orders. Now get going!" and so saying he dissapeared. "Orders!,
 58 what orders!" but he had dissapeared.
 59      I crawled back into the tub and started to examine it more
 60 closly. it wasn't long before I had found all the controls.
 61 Everything was fairly standard, with th exception of the small red
 62 button marked find querry. "Must be a new feature." I thought reaching
 63 towards it.
 64  
 65      "when I pushed the button a huge whole opened in the ether. I could 
 66 see all those around me being sucked in. The whirlwind grew larger 
 67 and larger. soon engulfing the whole front room of the Inn."
 68  
 69      There was a loud poping noise and suddenly I and everyone who
 70 had been in the Inn were on a seemigly endless plane of glass.
 71  
 72      A man in black stood in the distance, laughping at our dazzed
 73 expressions. before I could do anything he dissapeared. "Come 
 74 back here you Pie stealer!" I screamed.

 79  
 80 Suddenly, I found myself, along with the others, on a plane of infinite
 81 two dimensions. There he was, The Lord of Destruction. Instantly drawing
 82 Evilbane from nonspace (this time in the form of a large ax), I prepared
 83 to issue my challenge. Seeing this, the man in black laughed, and being
 84 the true coward he is, fled into the temporal flow.
 85  
 86 The chase was on!

 93 "OH GREAT!", thought Trokin Korka, "we're in a two demensional plane!" 
 94    Then suddenly, out of nowhere appeared for a second a man clothed all
 95 in black. "That's the person you called the Lord of Destruction!?!"
 96    "Yes it is!", said the Berserker angry at himself for letting the Lord
 97 escape. 
 98    "No one can get anything done in two demensions", I thought, "but I can
 99 call upon the power of the Pyramid to retrieve us from this!"
100    I then repeated an incantation known only to our tribe, of which I am
101 the last living member, that would take us all to the Pyramid. "Nashatar
102 Nickatr Poradati Pakanear", I yelled in the glass plane, which promtely
103 shattered the plane.
104    I looked around, finding myself in the familliar surroundings of the 
105 central chamber of the Pyramid, surrounded by unfamiliar people. The 
106 blue miniature Pyramid in the center of the chamber glowed recognising
107 my return. The entire group of adventurers from the tavern known as
108 Celene's Tavern was inside the chamber, looking frankly, as if they didn't
109 believe what they were seeing at all. Finally, the guy in the orange robes
110  
111  
112 said, "A long age ago, a group of the Lord's of Destruction split away from
113 the other's, wanting to do no more evil. Legend has it, that since they were
114 once Lords of Destruction thamselves, they every move that the evil one's 
115 would make, so by knowing these things, they almost exterminated the evil ones.
116 But, by doing so, they vanished from my original plane, never to return.
117 Legend says that they all died out over 1000 years ago. But only they could
118 have built this Pyramid, and only they knew the incantation that he knew, 
119 fellow adventurers, our friend is a Lord of Light!"
120    As soon as he finished they all looked very shocked, and stared at me in
121 a most unbeliving way.

125 I sat and watched all this weird stuff transpire.  I light up a cigarette and
126 continued to watch.  Nobody seemed interested in me, so I decided not to be
127 interesting.  I did, however, wonder about that bathtub that blew a hole in the
128 space time continuum.  I also thought about cakes  being square and pies being

144 With two rapid changes of worlds I was reeling. I could feel the orb 
145 pulling power from me at a tremendose rate.
146  
147 I began to lose conciosnes, it felt as if I was about to travel to the
148 space beyond, when suddenly I heard my masters voice "Wonderer, reach
149 out. You can feel a source of power. You must tap it." 
150  
151 I tried to draw on my own power.
152 "No!" my master said. "You must save your power, there is a source you
153 can use. reach for it. "
154  
155 I reached out as I was told. I could feel a certain pull drawing me on.
156 It was not hard once I started. Suddenly I was bathed in a briliant light.
157 All went black.
158  
159 (switch to third person.)
160  
161 The man in the fadded jeans and t-shirt feel to the floor. He was breathing
162 heavily, but seemed to be alive and stable. about his body played the
163 subtle light of magic. And in the air was the smell of a powerfull
164 spell brewing...

175     "Wait a minute!", said Trokin Korka, "I'm not a true Lord of Light".
176     All around me (Trokin Korka), the adventurers from the Tavern were 
177 gathered, still stareing at me not knowing what to do or even think. 
178     Then suddenly the man in orange robes spoke, focusing everyone's 
179 attention upon him. "But you have to be! Only a Lord of Light can speak
180 the incantation that rescued us from the two dememsional plane!"
181     "I may be a member of the tribe of the Lords of Light, but not all
182 members of that tribe are Lords of Light. I'm the last member of the tribe
183 still alive, but I am only the custodian of the Pyramid, only knowing the
184 most basic of spells that my ancestors knew. The Lords of Light have had
185 their souls, spirts, essences if you will, preserved though in the Blue
186 Pyramid, which has always been the source of their power, and is what gave
187 me the power to use that spell", said I.
188     All of a sudden, the Blue Pyramid glowed very brightly, drawing all of
189 our attention towards it, also signifing a large power drain for a very
190 powerful spell. I was not worried though, for the Blue Pyramid could supply
191 the power for a over a million more similar spells, and it recharges itself
192 by gaining its energy back, almost instantly from the core of a nearby 
193 quasar. 
194     Then behind us we heard a thud, causing all of the fellow adventurers
195 to turn around abruptly in surprise, just glimpsing a man in jeans and a 
196 T-shirt fall to the ground breathing heavily, with the glow of the spell
197 that brought him to the Pyramid, and which from the looks of things was
198 going to do something else unknown to us, all around him. A blue lightening
199 bolt then shot upward from the Blue Pyramid, causing no damage to the 
200 indestructable stone, but bounced backwards, spliting into parts, each 
201 hitting an adventurer. The bolt hit me last of all causing a blue light to
202 invade my brain zapping me, like everyone else, into an unconsious state

206      John Eddison,Inter Dimensional Police officer, was to say the least
207 a bit annoyed. First he had somhow transported all the occupents of the Inn to 
208 some endless plane of glass, and then the Pie thief had gotten away before
209 he could do a thing about it. It was not enough that he was underpaid,
210 now he was having to put up with rapid world shifts, seemingly uncatchable
211 criminals, and probably the most motley group of peaple ever assembled.
212  
213      As he thought on the events of the last few minutes a huge burst
214 of power began to circumvent the room. He could see a lightning bolt
215 heading towards him, and before he could duck it struck him. It singed
216 his hair severly and put him down for the count to boot.
217  
218      "Wake up, Wake up you." John Eddison returned slowly to conciosness.
219  
220      "Hmmm, What is it. It cant be time to get up yet. I think I'll sleep in."
221 He said groggily.
222      "Wake up you fool, Evil forces are afoot." when this had no effect the
223 little brown man kicked the Inter Dimensional Police officer soundly in
224 the side.
225  
226      "Ouch!, whats the meaning of this?, who are you?"
227  
228      "Its me you idiot, Arthur Brownie, Your sleeping on the job, the boss
229 wont like this..."
230  
231      "Oh, yes your the fellow from the Inn. Say, do you happen to know what
232 my orders were?"
233  
234      "How should I know, They were your orders. Am I supposed to know
235 everyones business?"
236  
237      "I dont suppose youd be willing to go back and get duplicates from the
238 boss would you?"
239  
240      "Hmm, sleeping on the job, and now your implying that you might have 
241 lost your orders?"
242  
243      "Yes, that is no, I didn't lose my orders. I was just kind of wondering
244 if it would be possible..."
245  
246      "Well, it isn't. you dont want to be fired do you?"
247  
248      "No. Say, everyone appears to be asleep. Lets wake them up and see
249 what happened."
250  
251      "You wake them up, I'm only a messanger."
252  
253      "Then I suppose that means you'll be leaving soon?" John Eddison
254 asked hopfully.
255  
256      "No, I'm going to keep my eye on you. I'm starting to think that
257 you might be a bit less the compatent. You know that they are cutting
258 back due to budget constraints. Have to get rid of some of the deadwood..."

272 After being eluded by my enemy on the two dimensional plane, I found 
273 myself, along with my fellow adventurers, in a strange Pyrimidal shaped
274 room with a small blue pyramid at the center. Then all hell broke loose.
275   First, a man in strange clothes appeared, reeking of Magick, and 
276 promptly collapsed to the floor. Then, a surge of power began to pulse
277 through the blue pyramid, finally bursting into the room. It bounced 
278 around on the walls, finally shattering into many small bolts, one of
279 which was aimed almost straight at me. I would have been struck if it 
280 weren't for my battle instinct (the birthright of all Berserkers). With
281 blinding reflexes, I drew Evilbane (now a shield) and deflected the 
282 blow. The force of impact from the two great energies was too great for
283 the fabric of the space time continuum to handle, though, and the ensuing
284 explosion threw me from the realms of imagined reality. It was then that

288 avenge the deaths of my newfound friends (little did I know that they
289 were yet alive). With a grim mind, I set upon his trail.

296 me.
297  
298 It was many moments before I could really look about me, When I could I
299 mentally took stock of what I saw. Our party had changed since I had last
300 seen it. The one who called himself the berserker was gone. But it
301 appeared that a small brown man had joined us. I could just see his
302 nose and eyes above the rim of the Bathtub.

304 All about me the others were in variose states of conciosness. It was
305 with a start that I realized that I could be to blame for this.
306  
307 "I am trully sorry, for any trouble I have caused. I did not mean for this

347 to be constructive, but I feel I should inform you that such comments

369 All:
370 	A portion of Backwater's past was the biweekly PorSFiS and
371 Backwater Irregular gatherings, where one could meet in person some
372 of the faces behind those names.  Those meetings are not held that
373 way any longer, but a rough equivalent happens about once a month.
374 The PCS (Portland Computer Soceity) Pizza Social is held on the first
375 Thursday of every month at Stark Street Pizza Company, located at
376 92nd and Stark.  I don't believe any of the newer Irregulars have
377 made it to one of these gatherings yet...
378 Next meeting is Thursday, August 4th at (roughly) 7:00pm.  The PCS
379 people have their own area reserved, a kind of back room to the right
380 of the cash register.  See you there!

383        "HEY YOU, WAKE UP! IT'S NOT BED TIME YET!", said someone right next
384 to my ear (yelled is a more acurate discription), and that made my head
385 hurt all the worse. (Magic, besides being very usefull to get things done, 
386  
387 also has a tendency to give one a massive headache (and its got EXCEDRIN 
388 written all over it), when one is on the recieving end of a spell.
389     "Ok! Ok...", I said, slowly getting into a sitting position, and trying 
390 to think of another one of the miniscule spells that a custodian of the 
391 Pyramid should know, one of the only spells that doesn't give one a headache,
392 the headache relief spell, know commonly as the EXCEDRIN spell.
393     "Oh! That's it!", I said, remembering the spell, "Metore Anar Vompakete
394 Mishtikere Wachanade", causing the Blue Pyramid to increase its glow minutly
395 , and only for a millisecond.
396     -Ah, that's much better-, I thought, then I looked around the room
397 seeing that everyone else had their headaches taken care of too, just as
398 forseen.
399     -Wait a minute, where is that Berserker who loves Smurfbars? He isn't 
400 here!-, my thoughts suddenly grew worried, -maybe that spell did something
401 else to him that it didn't do to us, with the state that the multi-verse is
402 in, he could be literally anywhere!.-
403     "Hey! Has anyone seen the Berserker since the blue lightening hit us?", 
404 I said.
405     "NO!", was the unanimous reply.
406     With that, I stood up, along with everyone else, (except for the guy in
407 the orange robes, who was just beginning to float
408 the orange robes, who was just beginning to float), and went over to the Blue
409 Pyramid, and asked it where the Berserker was, "My ancestors, all-knowing!
410 Could I, your humble servant ask you where one of my companions, the 
411 Berserker, is?".
412     A rumbling, angel-like mixture of voices resounded through the chamber, 
413 "We will being a search for your companion, my child, but since we have to
414 look through the entire multi-verse for him, it will be a while, about seven
415 minutes, and then you will have your answer".
416     -Ok, I might as well pass the time by asking the magician in jeans and
417 T-shirt what happened-, I thought moving toward him, but stopping when I
418 saw that he was in a deep meditative state, not wishing to intrude, I 
419 decided to just ponder the recent events while waiting for an answer.

423  
424 Making my way slowly through the continuum, I eventually reached the 
425 Fissure. The pain of separation was upon it, for it was still being 
426 ripped apart by the strength of my nemesis. Cautiously, lest I alert my
427 quarry to my presence, I closed in upon the focal point of the crack,
428 and found the Dark One there. I prepared myself for my attack.
429     I sprung into the continuum, and caught him by surprise, so intent 
430 was he upon his effort. This advantage didnot last long though. He turned
431 to face me and drew a sword emanating with dweamors of power. Leveling
432 this at me, he charged. Pulling Evilbane from nowhere, I deftly parried
433 the blow, and we were locked in mortal combat. He swung, I blocked. I 
434 swung, he dodged. We went on like this for a eternity of timelessness,
435 untill my stamina proved the greater, and he was forced to draw back to
436 rest. Now was my chance.
437     I retreated for a second, and entered the Berserkergang. I felt the 
438 power of the frenzy come over me, coursing through my veins, alerting
439 my nerves, connecting my whole being for battle. The Berserkergang drew
440 my senses into total awareness, and I instantly knew of everything 
441 happening about me. Before he even knew what he was doing, I had
442 prepared myself for the Dark One's next charge. The force of my blow
443 shattered his blade, despite the magics laid upon it, and I was aware
444 of the crunch of the bones in his arm as they shattered under the impact.
445 He reeled away in pain, and attempted to flee, but it was in vain. In
446 the same fluid motion, I thrust Evilbane through his chest, and his
447 foul, black blood ran down the edge. As the victor of the battle, I
448 could command his soul to one task before it went on.
449     "If any of my companions yet exhist, go to them and do whatever
451 they say. By the laws of eternity, I command it."
452     A shriek came from the body, and it collapsed into dust. The life
453 force had left it to follow out my order. Exhausted by my exertions, I
025=Usr:70 Kurfur Redlig     08/01/88 23:38  Msg:2003 Call:10003119  Lines:9
454 let go of Evilbane, and it promptly disappeared (leaving the blood to
455 disperse midair), and I allowed myself to slip into non-existance to
456 rest. My last thought before I fell into nothingness was, "How are 
457 people going to find me if I don't exist for a while? Who of my party
458 is left to try and find me anyways?". With that, I became unaware of
459 everything. I wouldn't exist untill I had fully rested from the
460 Berserkergang.

480     "My child, we now know where your companion, the Berserker, is.", said
481 the same rumbling, angel-like mixture of voices, just like it had said before.
482     That voice broke me out of my thinking state, where I had been for the 
483 past seven minutes. "Oh great ones, the Light of the Universe! Where is our
484 lost adventurer?", said I knowing that they would tell me, and also that they
485 know almost everything, if given enough time. 
486     The Blue Pyramid glowed slightly while saying, "He is inbetween realities
487 , inbetween demensions, the exact area is hard to explain, but we have loaded
488 that location into our memory, and if you use the basic transport spell, it
489 will take you there, or retrieve him from that place".
490     Then, an evil, screeching howl started as soon as the Pyramid stopped 
491 talking, causing everyone's hair to stand on end. Next, a wispy mist started
492 circling through the room, condensing into the phantom of the Lord of
493 Darkness, which then said, "Your companion sent me here to ask for your
494 judgement when he defeated me, so I ask, what is thy judgement? Let's get it
495 over with."
496     The man in the orange robes floated over toward him, and said, "This is 
497 thy judgment: You are to return the Pie you stole", and the Inter-demensional
498 Police Officer looked pleased, "and after you are done with that, you are to
499 repair the damage that you have done to the multi-verse. After that, you are
500 to return to your dark plane never to travel between demensions again. That
501 is our judgement!"
502     The evil one screeched it's dark laughter, "I cannot repair the damage
503 between demensions, for I am only following orders, and it was not my, power
504 between demensions, for I am only following orders, and it was not my power
505 that caused the rip in the space-time continum! It was the King of the Lords
506 of Darkness that ordered me to do this work, and it was his power that caused
507 this damage. Even Trokin Korka, the last of the sickening tribe of do-gooders
508  that called themselves the Lords of Light, with the help of the distaseful
509 Blue Pyramid, would be hard pressed to win a battle over the King and his
510 minions, which number in the thousands, and each of whose magical powers
511 are equivalent to a Knight of Magick in the days of power of the ugly good
512 Empire of the Multi-Verse, over five millenium ago. This rip in the 
513 space-time continum is just the first step in our domination of the
514 multi-verse. Oh! Here's your pie", and he flopped a round pie onto the
515 floor of the chamber.
516     With another howl, he vanished, never to return, the man in the orange
517 robes said, "This is much worse than I thought, the whole tribe of the 
518 Lords of Darkness are almost too much for all of us together, including the
519 Berserker, but he is missing, and we need every sword and magical power in
520 the ensueing battle with the Lords. Trokin, could you retrieve him from the
521 Darkness of Eternity?"
522     I then spoke the return of Missing person spell, causing the Blue 
523 Pyramid to glow very slightly, "A Nure Nee KoideaKombe Cishta!".
524     A pop sounded, and then the Berserker appeared on the floor of the
525 Central Chamber of the Pyramid, out cold. I went over to him, and shook
526 him awake, saying, "Yo! Wake up! We need you wide-awake".
527     "How did I get back?", he said very unbeliveing, "I was in the middle
528 of the Darkness of Eternity, nothing could find me in that!"
529    "Just a simple spell, but I must tell you, he wasn't the only one
530 that we have to be concerned about.

531 The Lord of Darkness that you killed, he was only their lowliest lackey,
532 the rest of the Lords, even with all of us together, are almost too much for
533 us all. We don't have much time, we have to face them before they are ready
534 , before they have time to prepare."
535     I then said to all, "Everyone! You know what the Lord of Darkness said, 
536 you know that we are up against an evil that has threatened our combined
537 planes for longer than most of us have been alive, do you all wish to come
538 still and keep your planes safe from harm?"
539    "YES!", was the resounding answer from all of them.
540    "OK!", I knew that that would be the answer, "we have to go to them, 
541 and not wait until they can get upto their full strength. Which means we
542 will be going to the stronghold of the worst evil that the multi-verse has
543 ever known. Everybody ready!"
544    Another resounding "YES!".
545    "Good! Then step over to the platform over there, and I will speak the 
546 spell that will take us there", I said and watched everyone get up and go
547 to the platform.
548    "Wait, my child! We must tell you something first!", said the Blue Pyr
549@ 
550 amid urgently.
551     "Yes, all-powerfull ones?"
552     "At the heart of their power is the Black Pyramid, our counterpart
553 in their universe, to destroy them, you need to destroy it. You have to speak
554 this incantation inside of the central chamber, the heart of all evil:
555 Amar Mouto Dishtakung Manear Lountare. Don't forget to touch the Black 
556 Pyramid with your two index fingers while saying the spell, and good luck
557 my child."
558     With that I stepped in the dais, and the incantation to take us all
559 to the heart of all evil flowed frommy lips, "Konditr Getre Jouiandere!",
560 the Pyramid vanished.
561     The universe swirled around us on our way to the Dark Plane...

566      The conversation with Arthur Browni had left John Eddison a little
567 on edge. His compatence was beyond reproach, everyone knew that.
568  
569      He woke up all of his companions and walked back over to the tub where
570 the Brownie still stood. "And how are you feeling today?" he asked
571 deciding to try the soft approach. 
572  
573      "Rotten, It seems its my duty to hang around with an idiot who 
574 travals around in a bathtub." the Brownie answered.
575  
576      "Feel free to leave any time you like, I'm perfectly capable.."
577      "Of screwing up without me around, I'm well aware of that
578 fact." the Brownie said finishing the Int-Dimensional Police
579 officers sentance.
580  
581      "Arghh, I should strangle you!"
582  
583      "No, you shouldn't. If you did it would look very bad on your
584 record. 'Officer attacs messanger brownie, is beaten to a pulp by
585 said brownie."
586  
587      "Look you short little Shmuck, I could take on you and ten 
588 of your brothers."
589  
590      "Really,? Well I wouldn't be so fast to talk if I were you. My 
591 brothers and I are the best Brownie tag team wrestling team around.
592 We've won the champion ship 3 years running."
593  
594      "Well," Eddison said stalling for time. "You dont play
595 poker do you?"
596  
597      "Oh, not much." the Brownie replied slyly.
598  
599      "Good!. We'll settle our differances over a good old fashioned 
600 deck of cards."
601  
602      "Sounds fine by me." The brownie said, pulling a deck of cards out
603 of his left sleav.
604  
605      At this time a wailing broke out in the pyramid. Suddenly a black
606 raith appeared. It said it was the spiret of the lord of darkness.
607 The keeper of the Pyramid asked it many questions, and found out
608 that Kurfer the barbarian had slain it. Also it was revealed that the
609 Dark lord was only one of many, and was in fact one of their lesser
610 minions. The Stolen pie was recovered and stashed by John Eddison in
611 the glove box of the Model GSG interdimensial Tub as evidance.
612  
613      The Group decided that the Evil forces must be destroyed.
614  
615      The Keeper of the Pyramid had brought Kurfer back, and so he
616 asked all to join him in destroying the evil of the Lords of 
617 darkness.
618   
619      "Well, I guess it is my duty to go, maybe you should report back
620 to the Boss?" Eddison suggested.
621  
622      "What, trying to weasal out of our poker game are you? Not a 
623 chance. We've got a score to settle, and I'm not about to forget it."
624  
625      "Ok, I guess I'll just manouver the old tub over there were
626 everyone is gathering."
627      
628      The Inter-Dimensional Police officer moved the tub over with the 
629 rest of the group.
630  
631      The Keeper of the Pyramid said the words to a spell and suddenly
632 all were moved to another plane. Or, more accuretly they were moved
633 onto an endless ocean. Everyone fell into the water. The brownie
634 ran forward and pushed a button, causing the tub to expand to the size of 
635 a large life raft. "Get going. I'm the brains, your the brawn. Help
636 those peaple in.
637  
638      Eddison helped those who needed it into the boat, everyone fit
639 comfortably.
640  
641      "Whoops!" The Brownie said, Now perched from the top of the shower pipe.
642 "Looks like somthing really big is heading this way."

650 the Berserker who liked Smurfs.  I wasn't quite sure, but I thought I'd missed 
651 out on an adventure.
652   I light up a sigarette and chuckled at how out of place tobacco would be in
653 a place like this.  But then I saw the space-man and his 'droid.  Sitting back
654 and ordering another beer I heared a fromiliar voice.
655   "Thoes things are nasty," she said "You really shuld quit."  She smiled as
656 she sat down in the bench across from me.

661   "'bout the same," I nodded, "Think I missed out on another, but I don't

664   "Any news from home?"
665   I took a drag off my cigarette.

672 the natives?"
673   "Mighty Is!  Only met one worthy, and she can't see me for nothing."
674 I took a heavy drag then blew the smoke into the air, "But it don't matter none
675 .  I know that."
676   "What do you do other than 'Applied anthropology'?"

728 When I came out of my meditation I found that the others were gone.
729 In fact it appeared that I had moved to another place. I stood and
7300movud to the path that lay before me, wonering how I had come to
731 be here and what had happened to the others.
732  
733 In the distance I could see a fountain. I walked towards it. Perhaps
734 I would find some answers there.

740     I looked up from the tub that had become a life raft and saw a huge mass
741 of darkness heading straight toward our tub at a very high speed. I then 
742 leaned over next to the Inter-Dememsional Police officer and asked if his dub
743 had some sort of exterior lighting.
744     "Yup this tub has everything that an Interdemensional Police officer could
745 ever want", he said, obviously very proud of the tub's workmanship.
746     "Could you please turn them on then", I said zest0as the dark mass of mist
747 enveloped our raft.
748     "Well, why didn't you say so?", he said while reaching down to hit one of 
749 the electro-luminesent controls, causing a brilliant white light to flood out
750 ward from the raft.
751     2Dhanks", I said to him, then I lifted my voice so the others could hear,
752 "Is everyone accounted for?", I inquired of the group.
753     Everyone looked around to see if anyone was missing, then the Berserker
754 said to me, "Everyone is here, excepd0fob0the guy that caused the blue 
755 lightening, who is nowhere to be found."
756     As soon as he said that, I got a feeling, almost a telepathic message
757 from the strange guy in blue jeans, which said that he is fine and all-right
758 and that we wyll meet him again before we begin the attck on the strong-hold
759 of the King of the Lords of Darkness.
760     I then said to the group, "I just got a strong feeling, message if you 
761 will, from our missing companion, which says that he is fi~e, qnd we will
762 meet him again before our attack on the strong-hold of the Lords of Darkness
763 , so let us", and at that I stopped speaking, for the mist lifted, and we saw
764 an Island ahead, which looked important.
765     "All in favor to lanting epon that Island.", I said.
766     "Aye!" said everyone except the brown guy, who said a vehement "Nay!", 
767 but took one look at the rest of us, who were all in opposition to him and shut
768 his mouth before half of the word had escaped his moeth.
769     "Ok! Turn us toward the Island then", I said.
770     The Inter-demensional Policeman turned toward the Island, and put the raft
771 in the highest speed it could attain.

819 extent I had beaten0it.
820 Deep down I knew that in some small way everything I was doing was
821 because of the benafits I would gain. My master once told me that
822 to give of ones self was the greatest gift a pearson could make.
823 On another occasion he had told }e txat all wisdom is spawned from
