34           Dr. Frankenstupe looked up from his book as his friend and 
35 therapist, Sigmund, entered the room.  "Hello, Sigmund.  Did you catch the
36 Young and Restless this week?"
37           "No, what happened?"
38           "Andy discovered that Tyrone wasn't really murdered in a gangland
39 execution, but that he has been hiding out with Jazz.  And, Victor and 
40 Ashley are making eyes at each other."
41           "Sounds complicated.  What else is new?"
42           "I bought a new hat.  Would you like to see it?"  Sigmund nodded.
43 Dr. Frankenstupe walked over to his closet and pulled out a double-billed
44 Sherlock Holmes hat.  "There's only one problem.  I think the hat has shrunk
45 It fit when I bought it, but now it's too small.  See?"  The Doctor put on
46 the hat.  It perched ridiculously on top of his head.
47           "Let me see it."  Sigmund said.  He took the hat and paused to
48 examine it.  "Hmmmm... If you wait a few days, the hat will fit properly."
49           "What's the problem?"  Frankenstupe asked.
50           "When you read your personal essay at the Inn, 'd' and the Grand
51 Dragonmaster laid some heavy praise on you, didn't they?"
52           "I guess they did."  Frankenstupe puffed his chest out proudly.
53 "It made me feel good--they're such good writers."
54           "You're suffering from a temporary case of swelled head or fat-
55 headitus as we call it in the business.  You'll return to normal, soon."
56           "I can see your point."  Frankenstupe said.  "Sometimes the Inn
57 can magnify feelings and emotions."
58           "Yes, remember the Dark Prince?"  Sigmund said.
59           "I'd rather forget."  Frankenstupe laughed nervously.  "I went a 
60 little overboard."
61           "Mushy to say the least."
62           "Yes, sometimes you can misinterpret your own feelings.  I saw my
63 own desire for simple friendship as something else."  Sigmund nodded in 
64 agreement.  Both men sat quietly for a moment.  Frankenstupe broke the 
65 silence.  "I'm preparing another essay for the Inn.  Let me show it to you."
66 He handed the essay to Sigmund.
67           "Hmmmm.... lots of feelings here.  Some may see this as being 
68 overly sentimental."
69           "Do you think so?"  Frankenstupe took the draft and reread it
70 intently.  Sigmund tiptoed out the door.

75 To All At The Inn:
76      Hello again!!  The wandering college student is back from 
77 OSU, and has just finished the last disk and a half with great interest.  
78 I only have a couple of questions...
79 
80      1)  What the Heck is PorSFis??  Is it a  gathering of those at the 
81 Inn, or of general SF fans,or what??  I would really like to know.
82 (See Point 2)
83 
84      2)  I am collecting info on various area Special Interest Groups.
85 I happen to be a Sherlockian Whovian Fantasy-SF-loving Trekker,who would
86 also like to get into MENSA and the SCA.  If anyone could furnish phone 
87 numbers,contact names,or meeting data,I would be in your debt for all of
88 spatio-temporal time (in this plane,of course.)
89 
90      Stories are as good as ever...keep up the great creating!!!
91 /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/Luingil/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
92 P.S.:DUNE was absolutely fantastic.  4Stars!! But if they ended it that
93 way,how are they going to film the next stories??
94 /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/Luingil again/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
95 :::::::::::::::O O::::::::::12/16:::::::::::::::15:09::::::::::O O:::::::::::::
96 Luingil: to address your questions -
97   1) Yes.  PorSFiS is the Portland Science Fiction Society.  It meets every
98 other Saturday (next meeting 12/29) at 2 PM at the Multnomah County Library
99 (downtown, on 10th).  This is followed at approximely 3:30 by the Friends
100 of the Doctor (Who).  (They are the strange looking folks you see on OEPBS
101 during the pledge drives after Doctor Who).
102 Several of the Innhabitants attend the PorSFiS meeting, and then retire to
103 the PC&S tavern at 1038 SW Morrison (2 blocks from the library) for socializing
104 and discussion of latest happenings on our favorite board.  PC&S does not
105 seem to be picky about ages, so if you are underage, don't let it stop you.
106 (just don't press your luck by  being too obviously juvenile).
107 In attendance yesterday was bard, voyeur, kathy, L'homme, MiG, Mad Max, 
108 Ian MacHinery, Quizmaster, Petrov, and several other identities I am not at
109 liberty to divulge. (oh, and the meeting was well-infiltrated by the NET).
110 Piper made an appearance once, accompanied by his pipes (which he played),
111 but he left his pegasus parked elsewhere.  Unfortunately, we have been unable
112 to entice him back again.  Noticable by their absences are Grand Dragonmaster
113 and Wassir, Tarn, Pam, d.
114 2).  For the SCA, I would suggest talking to _Leonard_, as he seems to
115 be involved in that rather bizzarre group.
116 MENSA has an answering service for non-member inquiries, the phone is 223-4502.
117 The membership secretary is Alix Drake-Williams, 777-0421.  One or the
118 other should be able to help you.  If you've taken the SAT and gotten 1300
119 or better, you've already qualified for entry.  There are other tests/scores
120 that can qualify, but I don't konow the details on them.  Otherwise, you have
121 to take their test.
122 So you liked Dune, eh?  Several of us saw it Friday, and were greatly 
123 disappointed.  For anyone who has read the book, they left a lot out, 
124 and while the first half of the movie was fairly faithful to what was left,
125 the second half diverged rather too much.
126 I'm expecting a review by A FILM FAN any day now on it; he's usually much
127 better at describing such things than I am. ("I don't know about art, but I
128 know what I like").
129 Oh, FYI, Petrov is a fellow Beaver.

132   The sun rose slowly over the distant mountains.  The snow created a
133 white blanket over everything in sight, only a few tracks from little
134 bunnies and the tall forest pine could be seen.  Milo turned to see if
135 he was still being followed.  Only a little bit more and he could find
136 cover in the forest ahead, got to keep moving.
137  
138   The faint barking of dogs were heard, Milo picked up his pace, got
139 to keep moving.  He couln't feel his feet it was so cold, a nice
140 warm fire and some hot cider sounded better than ever before.
141  
142   Milo was now running in and out of the tall pine trees.  He stumbled
143 and fell almost every twenty feet, the dogs were getting closer.
144 Milo stopped neer a tree that had a lot of branches near the bottom, he
145 tried to climb it but his fingures were too cold to grab anything at all
146 Oh his hands hurt trying to move them.  He fell into some snow covered bushes
147 below.  He could here the dogs, they had been onto his trail for hours
148 now.  Milo was running out of ideas, he reached into his pocket where he
149 kept whatever magical items he had; He collected them, not knowing wha
150 some of them were, a few were from his father.  He fumbled around until
151 he found the one he was looking for.  His grandfather gave him this and told
152 him never to show it to anyone else and to only use it in great danger.
153 The bad thing was his grandfather never told him how to use it, he wasnt
154 old enough yet.  He took it out and looked for something to press.  The
155 dogs were now in the forest and getting closer.  His cold fingures felt
156 around for a hidden catch that he remember his father showing him a
157 long time ago.  The dogs were close, milo had his fingure on the hidden
158 plate but couldn't press down hard enough.  He looked over his shoulder
159 and saw the dogs racing towards him through the thin covering of bushes.
160 He had to get it on this try or it would be all over for him.  With a
161 last effort, he gave it all he could and pressed the plate.

164   There is a part, I hope you like it.  I better get going, I've taken up to

167 p.s.  Mike: It's getting a lot worse.
168 UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
169 At last a clear mission. A task. I had to get the secret of the necklace back
170 to the Diamond Valley so we could return to the Inn.  I had hoped to get a
171 ride with the Pegasus, but she was embroiled in a fight with a griffin of
172 some sort and I could only watch it helplessly. I trudged off in the endless
173 sand heading in what I hoped was the general direction of the Valley.  As I
174 did so, a steady wind arose blowing the golden grains into a blinding
175 cloud. I marched through the sparkling paste of air and sand with no notion
176 of whether or not I was nearing my goal. So. The old dilemma. A clear pur-
177 pose, but no clear way of action. One can only struggle. The wind increased
178 to a shrill whistle and the gliitering sand slithered under my shoes. Soon
179 I was slogging through loose sand up to my knees, hips, waist. I stopped
180 worrying about making progress and began paying attention to staying alive.
181 The more I struggled, the faster the bright tide rose.  When my shoulders
182 were covered, terror stopped my screams and when my eyes were covered I 
183 must have fainted for I felt and thought nothing except for being conscious
184 of feeling and thinking nothing. 
185 Then my toes felt cold.  My feet and knees got chilly. Death. I waited. I
186 found movement in all the parts that were chilled and my feet seemed to be
187 on glass or ice. Not Death. The sand was sifting away from the bottom and
188 when my eyes were freed, I found myself in the Diamond Valley near the
189 Citadel.  So. the old saying. You must lose yourself in order to find your-
190 self. As I sprinted up the steps of the citadel I reflected that losing
191 yourself in liquor, drugs, or any number of other vices would be more fun
192 and just as instructive without leaving sand in your shoes and pockets,
193 but there's another old saying about not being able to choose the instru-
194 ment of your education.
195 L'homme, Bard, Milchar,Piper, and the Docter were in the great hall inspec-
196 ting a crazy complex of wires, switches, dials, and gears built from the
197 contents of Bard's traveling hardware show.
198 "Where have you been?" demanded L'homme. "We're all set to blow the door.
199 We almost left without you."
200 Oh, Boy. Now I get to be a hero. Heroine.
201 I tried to think of a dramatic way to reveal my gem of wisdom.
202 "Contrary to our modern, linear, mechanized thought patterns," I began,
203 KA=--B-O-O-O-OOOOM!   Bard had pressed the switch.
204 So. The old saying.  As soon as you're conscious of being a hero, then you're
205 not humble enough to be one anymore and besides you're too busy showing
206 off to get the job done that was supposed to make you a hero in the first
207 place. Heroine.
208 The blast succeeded in rousing the Blue Demon and several hundred blue 
209 globuloids, but the door hadn't budged.
210 "Milchar, LISTEN! Give me the necklace," I implored.
211 Milchar was busy emitting energy bolts to slow Blue Demon as he lumbered
212 toward us so I grabbed the necklace and ran to the Great Door. Sure enough,
213 the clasp fit the lock perfectly.
214 "Hurry!" I yelled and the rest of the band joined me.  We backed through
215 the door lobbing pieces of Bard's epuipment at the blue beast. The Doctor
216 snatched the yellow part of the necklace just as the door slammed shut.
217 We turned and found ourselves amidst a band of philosophers, poets, mad
218 technicians, and assorted dreamers.  We were at the 	Inn!
219 "Greetings," said the Innkeeper, "A strange fellow came in a few hours ago
220 and left this for you. Seemed to expect a reply."
221 It was a small box made of green stone. Inside was a note instructing us
222 to put the yellow necklace inside.  "Opening the North Door has rendered
223 Blue Demon powerless. Closing this lid will return the necklace to me. You
224 have completed your quest. --Mariani"
225 We closed the lid and watched as the box faded from view.
226 Then we all started cheering and laughing at once. We bought drinks for
227 everyone and told tall stories until daylight.
228 So. The old saying. There's no place like home.
229 UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU Lila UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

231   FROM PROMETHEUS; THE DESIGNED
232   Stricken with pneumonia it seems, or at least that is the general conensus of minds. I see a specialist or something kee
233 like that tomorrow.
234   Until then, I have plenty of stuff to do here, which includes reading Dune for an English Literature class, writing three
235 major writing assignments and finishing off a pente gaming program of sorts. Enough for the duration, I dearly hope.
236 
237   Assorted messages follow, of course. Sometimes I am slightly affected by the monotony.
238 
239   Sondargaard; It seems that I am not going to be out of this room for quite some time, therefore I will see if I can ask
240 somebody to do all this legwork.
241   About the indecipherable stuff at the top of the page, the first word has special meanings to me, and only me. So please
242 don't get worried about your eyesight or anything, and as for the other two denotations they are easy for any self respecting
243 Cryptac.
244 
245   Man in Gray; I must speak with you again, at the time you spoke to me today I was in my worst condition so far, so please
246 don't become too worried. I seen a nifty doctor tomorrow and everything will be alright soon.
247   And as for my sense of humor, I think it is resting up somewhere but my politeness seems to be skyrocketing for some reason
248 that I don't fully comprehend.
249 
250   kathy; Sorry for missing the latest PorSFiS and subsequent visit to this universes counterpart of the Inn. I realize that I
251 am the only thing holding things up, but I will try to do better.
252 
253   Tammy; Your writing is a fine addition to the annals of Backwater. Very nice, and a pleasure to read. And let me assure you
254 that you do not have a reputation like that, it was only one comment of yours that someone was talking about.
255   Anyway, what are your chances of ending up at a PorSFiS someday? I would so much like to meet you, and I always did enjoy
256 watching peoples faces as they meet Backwater personalities face to face.

260   The Former lifted his white cloak and swirled it as far and as wide as it would go. The spirits of everyone seemed to be
261 lifted quite highly at the moment, probably do to the end of the Ruby Valley quest or something really interesting like that.
262   The Former so wanted someone to explain to him what had happened first hand, instead of all this rumor and gossip stuff.
263 
264   For instance the stories about a Red and Silver pegasus fighting for control of a Citadel of pleasure and pain? All of it
265 was a little wild, even for Milchar, or even L'Homme for that mattter. A little too wild period!
266 
267   Someone handed him a glass of some red liquid, with a message carved in the foam at the top. "No place like Home" it said.
268   Some of the more agile persons were starting to dance, and it was always fun to watch slightly drunk people dance, so The
269 Formwr stepped carefully to a seat where the sights were good, and the abandoned drinks were full.

298 Dual Part Message:
299 Leonard:I am pretty sure the old TRS80 has ROM problems. After going through the ordered diagnostics, all results point
300 to bad ROMs. ROM problems can be addressing, non-repairable bit errors, or chip select problems. I can't check for tri-
301 states with the equipment I have, but given a scope it is easy to detect. If a chip select problem is the culprit, I doubt
302 the start-up procedure would get as far as it does. I would bet on address or data problems. If I can borrow another set
303 of ROMs, I can even further reduce the unknowns. All is not lost!
304 FILM FAN:Don't be too hard on Dune, if and when you impart us your insightful viewpoints. Remember, movies are merely a 
305 visual and auditory extension of someone's imagination, and it can't be all things to all people.
306 Ian Mac.:Was that really you? If you carefully re-read the entries, you will notice an oversight on your part. Also, when
307 one is about to be given $200 million, one should not be looking the proverbial gift-horse in the mouth!
308 voyeur:How was dinner? And desert/dessert(!)? haha! Was Mr. Schmidt there too? Lucky guy, your neighbor...
309 @#)_%*_@#)*%@_#)%* Part two:
310 	Back at the Inn at last. The place hadn't changed much. The well-worn furnishings didn't look too much more the worse for
311 wear. What stories they could recount of famous tellers who had regailed all within earshot tales of adventure and
312 intrigue. Intrigue! Yes...It was time.... It had been many months since I was sent to that forsaken mineral
313 valley, but before that, Joshua, and that damned guru. I spied a familiar looking person accross the hub-bub of the Inn.
314 Gaudy! What was she doing here? Who cares. It was time to get back.
315 Standing on a table, mug in one hand, I attempted to attract everyone's attention. Begrudgingly, the rest of the patrons put
316 their story-telling and debating on hold for a moment, and lent me their elusive ears.
317 "My friends, I must say, with some regret and remorse, that I must leave the comfortable confines of the Inn once again.
318  Nothing warms my heart more than to be here with all of you, reliving adventures, taking part in stimulating debates, but
319  I must set forth on an adventure of my own. A quest in another place, another time. A place not like the Inn. A place of
320  evil and hate, where madmen try almost daily to take over the world. Unfortunately, this place is where I was born, and
321  now I must return. I feel I have some unfinished business there. A dear friend, who I feared lost, may not be lost,
322  but only momentarily sidetracked. I can not rest until I know the truth. I would like nothing more than to stay here,
323  slaying dragons, rescuing fair damsels, and restoring kingdoms to their rightful heirs, but a duty of another kind
324  calls. Enough long goodbyes! Drinks for all! On me! One last time for my dear friends at the Inn, and then I'm off!"
325 	After the last of the round had been downed, a few good-lucks and pats on the back, and a rather large bill to
326 settle with the good innkeeper, I set off to get Gaudy. She was standing by the entrance to the Roman Baths, and her
327 expression of apprehension told me she had heard my speech, and knew of the quest I spoke of. Without a word, I grabbed her
328 hand, and we made our way to the exit. Closing the heavy oaken door behind us, we took one last look at the Rowan tree, 
329 and bid the Inn our silent goodbyes. How would we get back this time? It didn't really matter. We always found a way; that
330 was never a problem. What would greet us on our return? That was a question that could only be answered in another time
331 and place.

334 Lila; Thank you ever so much for finishing.  I had thought about my leaving the story to the rest of you later, then
335 decided to *MAKE* time for one more entry, but you seem to have wrapped it all up for me.  Thanks again.
336 Ahhh, the Inn again.  Amazing how it stays unchanged by all the action and excitement that surrounds it on all sides.
337 I believe that my visit will be longer next time before I venture forth on another quest.  Time to return to my Tower.
338 Hm.  Been awhile since I've been there... just before the Kol-um-bee-ya (sp?) adventure (about April, earth time).
339 Waving goodbye to L'homme, Gaudy M., and the rest of the patrons of the Inn, I strode through the door into the falling
340 snow outside.  "Farewell for a while...", I whispered.
341 Taking a bit of the dust out of my bag, I spread it out in a circle about me.  "Crilcoelfmaem.", I said, invoking the
342 slumbering power within the dust.  A faint tounge of flame arose from the dust, spreading quickly to ignite the entire
343 circle.  As the flame rose higher and higher, I was lifted from this world to another.
344 Abruptly, the silvery fire vanished, all traces of it gone.  No one but the Rowan tree noticed that the man inside
345 the circle had disappeared.

350 ok, voyeur, how come I'm not on the list of conspicuously missing persons
351 from PorsFis? Didn't anybody NOTICE? And you guys weren't even totally
352 floored by Dune like we were and like anybody with even the rudiments of a
353 central nervous system should be. So maybe later you'll put in a list of
354 INconspicuously missing people, huh?

366   At the inn at last!  The piper, bereft of his pipes, sat quietly at a plank
367 table in the shadows.  A plate of the innkeeper's famous stew, several flagons
368 of the famous nut-brown ale with the faint flavor of summer, and he felt much
369 refreshed.  He stepped into the Roman Bath at the rear of the inn and repaired
370 much of the damage to his adventure-scarred costume -- then examined himself
371 in the mirror.  Staring back from a tangle of beard, two guilt-rimmed eyes
372 accused him of abandonment and betrayal.
373   "Excuse me sir, could I help you?"
374   The piper jumped, startled out of introspection by the bath attendant -- 
375 a rather quiet, unassuming person.  "Yes... Yes, indeed," answered the piper.
376   Some time later, costume mended, clean, fed, and ready to start again, the
377 piper pushed open the scarred plank door of the end.  He had not paused for
378 lengthy farewells, but left confident of a swift return.  He had crossed the
379 bridge, giving brief glance to the stream, then followed the path into the
380 woods when he stopped with a grunt of pain.  Clutching his side, he tried to
381 hold in burning agony.  After infinite moments, he could again move and think
382 and he looked down at the once-pristine whitness of his shirt.  No longer 
383 white, the blood was soaking through the tightly pulled linen.  Gritting his
384 teeth against the pain, the piper removed his blood-soaked shirt and used it
385 to wipe the blood from the wound.  In the moment before it was obscured again,
386 he saw his skin whole and unbroken.

394   The Former saw a few depart from the Inn, knowing sadly where they must go. As the heavy oaken doors closed, and no longer
395 could he see those departing, the Former looked around for another empty table.
396   After finding one, and avoiding as many collisions as possibe the Former quietly stepped onto a chair and from there stepped
397 to the top of a table. Quickly he sat himself down,and asked soemone to bring his bushel of leaves.
398 
399   After selecting a slender leaf, one with many lines embedded in it's green length, the Former ate a small bite of the edge.
400   As what the Former had just eaten reached his tounge, the Former remembered where these had been collected. A small world,
401 when compared, but for all of it's length, it was covered with swamps and forests, most especialy the rain forests.
402 
403   The rain forest where his one had been picked was a large and tall one, with heavy scents of wood, and plants wafting throug
404 the air which was already damp with light rains.
405 
406   A small and noble race was living and dying in this forest. It was fighting against all manner of perils, picking these damp
407 leaves as a delicacy for only a few grew within that forest.
408 
409   The Former wanted to tell a story about these little friends of his, old time compaions. So why not?
410   The sitting figuire tried to cllect all the facts, and to allow for a littlle embellishment. Soon he would tell the story.
411   Soon, for the first time, he would tell a story at the Inn. First he ought to watch others telling tales, to learn their
412 ways of entrancing those that sat against a soft chair and listened.

421 as the cloaked and hooded figure passed the Rowan Tree, the sounds of talk and
422 boisterous laughter filled the air from the building on her left.  She pushed
423 the door open, and her eyes drank in the scene. The people sitting, standing,
424 moving from table to table with their ale-mugs,the jokes, the stories...
425      "Well, and what can I do for you?" the Innkeeper took her measure with 
426 his glance, and Luingil relized for the first time that not only was she in,
427 but she had walked the length of the Inn while taking in the sights.
428      "Just an ale, please." The Innkeeper gave her a mug and she gave him one of
429 her few remaining coins, then moved to a small unoccupied table in the corner
430 of the room.  She unfastened her grey cloak, letting her long blonde hair
431 spill out of the hood, and draped it over the back of her chair.  Then she sat
432 down and took a long pull at the ale, finally relaxing and listening to the 
433 stories circulating around the other travellers.

437 Well, I liked DUNE so much that I have now watched it 3 times.  There
438 is some of the book that was left out as it always is with book adaptations
439 otherwise it would have been a 5 hour movie and we all know that the big boys
440 in movieland do not like movies that long.
441 CITY HEAT was a bomb, but them again this is just my word.  Great to see
442 once if you can see it FREE.
443 STARMAN:  Ok, worth at least a look at.  I was put together ok.  
444 2010:  Now I liked the movie, but I've only seen it twice now.  I must
445 say, I like DUNE better and a lot of other people must agree with me.
446 2010 is having about the same amount of business as Beverly Hills Cop
447 is right now.  And DUNE is way out in front.  (For this Weekend).
448 MOVIES STILL TO COME:  John Dangerously, looks ok, not sure yet; The
449 Flamingo Kid, maybe another sleeper;  PROTOCOL (potential bomb);
450 Micki & Maude (with Dudley Moore) im seeing this one; The COTTON CLUB,
451 (not my kind of movie); and WALT DISNEY'S CLASSIC  "PINOCCHIO", a great
452 movie to take little nephews too.  Oops, (sorry Tom)  I left out Tom
453 Selleck's RUNAWAY.  All of these will be starting FRIDAY (not sure about
454 John Dangerously yet) so be watching for them.

So, another WHO fan wanders into the INN.  Doctor Craig follows the 
457 Doctor and gets called upon at work to straighten out the novice 
458 watcher friends.    "What happened to the older Guy", You mean Pertwee,
459 "yea", well he was the third Doctor who regenerated into Tom Baker.
460 "But we are watching Peter Davidson now",  that's because we have
461 OPBS, this is how they have them.  "But... But... ", forget it.
462 
Now for the Doctor list:
463   Peter Davidson will be aired in its entirety (Season 19,20 & 21).
464 earlier this year we saw (19&20) but we have not seen 21 yet.  After
465 the 21st season.  OPBS tells me that they are going to reair Pertwee
466 without any holes.  As you may have noted, some episodes were not 
467 available earlier this year.  They also told me that maybe some Hartnell
468 or Troughton maybe aired (the early Doctor archives have had a lot of
469 film moths) but which ones is not sure.
470 
Lila -- "philosophers, poets, mad technicians and assorted dreamers", does
471 indeed about sums up the lot at the Inn.  But you may add One Smurf to your
472 list that is able to drop in from time to time to let you hear from him.
473 Just because you do not see any entry from me, do not think that I am
474 not around.
475   I did see the remark about Tammy and me and I must say that since she
476 does not work at THE LAB that she and I are not.  (Too bad?).
477   
I think Sondargaard is sleeping from all of the late nights he has
478 been puting in recently.
479 
  Well to all ------ A Merry Christmas & and happy reading.

483   Milo pressed his frozen fingers onto the hidden plate.  He heard
484 a faint click, he knew he was done for, he closed his eyes and prayed
485 for a miracle.  His hands clutched the small artifact as he waited for
486 the oncoming doom.  But nothing happened, he listened without moving his
487 head, he couldn't hear a thing.  He gathered his courage and looked 
488 over towards the dogs, they stood there like statues, no breath, no
489 barking, no movement.  Milo was unsure about this, he took a twig from 
490 the bush and threw it at the stone like dogs, it fell in front of one
491 and nothing happened.  
492  
493   Walking over to the dogs, milo noticed that the sound from the forest,
494 the birds and creek had stopped.  He looked at the artifact in his hand,
495 that must be what caused all this.  Milo walked over to the two men
496 further behind the dogs, they were ridding behind the dogs on some sort
497 of sled.  They wren't moving, they weren't even breathing.  They were
498 still warm but there was no heartbeat, on them or the dogs.  Just then
499 milo looked up and saw a couple of birds frozen in mid air, wings 
500 stationary.  Milo though, this little artifact must either stop time 
501 around him or make him so incedibly fast that time didn't mean much anymore.
502 Milo walked over and hid behind a tree, he paused for a minute watching the
503 still figures remain motionless.  He laughed a little bit then pressed the
504 plate on the artifact again.  The dogs burst to life and jumped into the
505 bushes where he just was.  The dogs barked and snarled at each other while
506 the two men rushed up with very puzzles looks on thier faces.  They looked
507 around and saw something moving behind a neer by tree.  They drew thier
508 swords and marched forward. 
509   
510   Milo seeing this, jumped out and threw a snowball at the man in front 
511 then jumped around.  The men rushed forward again swords slashing the
512 cold air in front of them.  Milo stopped jumping and shouting and stood
513 still, fingure on the small plate getting ready to press.  The man ran closer
514 and leaped sword first into the waiting joker, this was the last time 
515 anyone would find him sneeking around the town store.  Milo waited until
516 the last second then pressed hard down on the plate, the two men stopped
517 dead in thier tracks.  This was getting fun, milo walked over and took
518 all of the weapons and supplies from them and then placed them face to
519 face.  This wasn't bad, new swords and a lot of food to boot.  Milo was
520 a long ways away when he pressed the plate again.  He looked back just in    
521 time to see the two men smash into each other.  Milo turned and walked
522 on.  What was this artifact that he had, the things he could do with it.

543 Seeing them live is much better...
544     They have at least 2 or 3 tapes other than the one you have, not to mention

557   FROM PROMETHEUS; NOT DEAD YET
558   Despite all attempts, I am still alive. tHE Doctor I went to has put me on very heavy doses of antibiotics, and I am now
559 tied permanently to little plastic bottles which I can not open anyway, but such is life.
560   Or death, I suppose, however it is to dangerous to ponder further, some Maniacal Metaphysicist will start helping me or some
561 thing dreadfull like that.
562 
563   Sondargaard and Makeeson; Risking life and limb I wearily stumbled my way (Actually I feel fine, but that ISN't any fun in
564 the telling...) to the latest drop point TO RETRreive the Item. After some odd glances (Young man, tipped felt fedora and
565 trench, the whole bit...) I retreived it. Source of my amusement for quite sometime, I eventually found the Answer.
566   The deal was, dear fellows in theE Key, that we be cryptic, not deceitfull. As any turn in the game, it is welcome though.
567   Wading though deceit is also an admirable trait, if it can be called a trait (Look out, I can see the Maniacal Metaphysicist
568 now...)
569   Anyway, the parcell is due for collection tomorrow before Mt1629.59. And so it goes...
570 
571   McKittrick; Sorry, but even when Rome was operating I was not a member. Now that it is down, I am even less of one. I am      572 sorry for you, there are other systems, all quite similar, so you could try one of those.
