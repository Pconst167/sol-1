33 it had remained for a full two days.  The transition from transient to

68 We stared at the interior of a barn, quite like something you would find
69 on a farm.  The owner must grow grain, I thought, looking at the modern
70 harvesting equipment in storage.  A quick check: yes, still daylight.
71 The Doctor looked out, then at the console.  He shook his head, muttering,
72 "No change in position, according to the display, here..."
73 Grann was having similar problems dealing with the new environment, but of
74 an entirely different sort.  He was looking at the machines, his mouth agape.
75 He studied them more closely, then asked, "What's U.S.R.A.?  Those letters are
76 marked on nearly everything out there.  Shovels, machines, everything."
77 The Doctor lookedt the monitor, wondering aloud.  "Well, history has changed
78 somewhat, according to Milch.  It's probably some variant of U.S.A., or some
79 such."
80 I decided it was time to find out.  We would need additional information,
81 anyway.  The TARDIS had slipped again; I doubted that the box had drawn us
82 all this way to look at a barn.  The real target was probably near, though.
83 I said, "Wait", and sent my self adrift.  I searched for a consciousness,
84 found one on a tractor.  I merged, delving into memories.  He didn't know
85 of such merging, or how to block me out.  I didn't plan on being there long,
86 anyway.  Staying too long muddied your personality with theirs.
87 Quickly, I found what I wanted, and pulled out.  I merged with myself back in
88 the TARDIS, a bit breathless.
89 "I...know some of the changes now, Doctor.  This is a place where Russia
90 turned instead to democracy after its revolution.  Communism was displaced
91 in the United States, or should I say, the young colony on North America.
92 We are now in the United Soviet Republic of America.  This barn is property
93 of the state, on a large communal farm.  The only other change I have diserned,
94 other than the ones that would logically follow Communism in North America,
95 is that Latin is not a dead language on this world.  It seems to be the
96 universal tounge here, replacing the English on the other Earth."
97 "Communism and Latin?  So radical a change in such a 'short' distance across
98 Paratemporally?"
99 "Only one or two decisions difference, Doctor.  But very important ones."
100 "Well...I suppose we ought to go looking around, for whatever we've arrived
101 for.  I think I'll gather travel packs."
102 "Better hurry," Grann said.  "Looks like company has arrived outside."

115 began to say that they would hel,p, too. Good.  i didn't want this to be 
116 a lonely trip and it looked like it wasn't, from the way people were
117 beginning to wake from their ale induced sleep and their ale enduced 
118 blind jollyness.  "I'm in." sounded from Emu and Piper, and some others

138      Trainor gazed around at his new found friends, but the movement of his
139 head caused the small rabbit to suddenly leap to a nearby table. "Piper, Emu,
140 and perhaps even you Faire Lady are very gracious to offer your aid. I thank
141 you with all of my essence for your calls of solidarity. Oh Zepher, you too
142 are very gracious to offer your kind assistance, and perhaps I am out of line
143 to question help since I need it so much. But I have seen many things in
144 my travels, and I have been many places in my Pell-mell, but never have I
145 seen a rabbit such as you! I do not wish to drag such a small creature as
146 yourself into a fray such as I see ahead of us. The going will be tough, and
147 I am afraid to say that survival is no guarantee. I would not think any less
148 of you if you decide you would rather sit this adventure out.
149      But enough of this downcast talk! Is there anyone else who wishes to

156 The Master's Shrinking Song (sung to Its a Small World)
157 By: The Companions of Doctor Who
158 
159 Once I learned a wonderful trick to play
160 On a planet light years
161 From Gallifrey.
162 Now opponents I shrink,
163 Quicker than you can blink,
164 Till they stand ten inches tall!
165 
166 Chorus:	It's a small world after all;
167 	It's a small world after all;
168 	It's a small world after all;
169 	It's a small, small world.
170 
171 There's a billion worlds each around a sun,
172 And a planet to conquer for everyone.
173 Oh, how grand it would be,
174 Even on Gallifrey,
175 If I shrank them one and all!
176 
177 CHORUS
178 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
179 	The Bard looked up from his pack. He had been working on something
180 inside it. He had presented a rather startling view, bent over with both 
181 arms and most of his upper body inside a pack that didn't *look* to be more
182 than a foot deep. As he straightened there was a mechanical sound from the 
183 pack (as of a bolt being released).
184 	"Yes, I believe I shall accompany you. However... it might be wise
185 do send someone to do some scouting. I also think that we may need some
186 HEAVY firepower, that is of course, if we need any at all.", he paused,
187 "Has anyone seen Fast Fred?"
188 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
189 Jim: that session was aborted by YOUR board hanging up on me! I might add
190 that I got hung up on BEFORE THE FOURTH LINE OF THE LOGON BULLETIN *four*
191 times... it looks like you've got some serious problems there....

194       "It would appear, Dear Isabell, that we left a little too soon.  I guess
195 my fault lies in my anxiety for action.  Should I go back for a moment, too
196 call them outside?"  With that, I pulled the reins and Isabell slowly turned
197 and then leapt forward in a bolt of speed.
198       After she had slowed from a canter to a trot, something told me she had
199 done that for a reason.  I never did decide what reason it was, only that she
200 had a reason.
201       I left Isabell at the hitching trees to the side of the Inn and walked
202 briskly to the door.  Opening it rather quickly, I poked my head inside and
203 said, "Anyone coming?"

207      an archived report... on the activities of german general shermer of the  
208 nazi african corps... leading up to his demise at the hands of a british patrol
209 in 1943...

210 ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
211     
"i expect another fity kilos of explosive placed by dawn... if they are
212 not placed... we will not have enough explosive force for operation Khamsim..."
213 the general was on the radio to a colonel towards the brittish front... the    
214 antenna bobbed as the car made it's way through a desert wind storm...

215     dust flew at the windshield and the driver was depending on the smallish   
216 green compass on the dash... the needle would go of the center mark... and the
217 car would turn to straighten with the needle...
218     a simple and effective way for a car to navigate... in the deep desert...  
219     general shermer lit a cigarette and turned the knob on his radio... a song 
220 about someone named 'lilly' danced over the static...

221     shermer wore a crooked little smile... due to a scar lengthwise along his  
222 lip... a polish soldier had marked shermer with it... during the blitzkrieg... 
223     on his lap there was a report... the top was marked with a swastika in red
224 and gold... with the words confidential in black stamped letters... strewn on
225 the page by a careless secritary in berlin...

226     the report read... "with this series of explosions... timed to the tides
227 and the desert Khamsim windstorm... we believe that the coast could recede...
228 past maradan and to the sea of calanscio..." shermer crooked his smile...
229     it continued... "thereby engulfing both sand seas with the mediterrainian
230 ocean... over half of africa would be sunken... most being allied strongholds
231 and settlements..." shermer laughed out loud at this...

232     "the writers of this report do not intend to tell the high command strategy
233 but we all feel... that this would turn the tide of the africa war in our favor
234 and support the manifest destiny of the master race..."

235     shermer closed the file and put it into his attache case... the operation
236 had been cleared through berlin... and rommel... expolsives were being placed
237 along the designated routes... soon the winds and tides would reach a peak...
238 and soon the desert would become a sea...

239 ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
240     
he was the driver... a competant sargeant of the africa corps... assigned
241 to deliver general shermer to the garisson at benghazi...
242     it was the desert storm... a torrent of wind blowing over the desert... a
243 hell to navigate through... in fact... the driver noticed something on the top
244 of the dashboard... a small notebook... with a pencil inside it... held fast by
245 a magnetic plate...
246     it had been drawing the comppass off course for at least the last hundred
247 miles or more... they had been driving... in circles...
248     
the driver halted the car... he dropped the notebook... and turned to the
249 rear seat in order to tell the general... from outside the rear window he spied
250 a large searchlight... an enormous pole... a brittish tank...

251     the doors to the car openned and brittish soldiers streamed in... shermer
252 drew his luger... the driver was wrestled to the ground... shermer shot himself
253 and the driver cringed...

254 ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
255     
the brits captured the plans for operation Khamsim... they proceded to
256 attack at el alamein... in time to distract the mine laying efforts and destroy
257 the nazi attempt to flood africa and turn the tides of war...
258     after the war... the documents and attache case were transferred to the
259 london historical archives... recently... terrorists detonated several bombs in
260 the archives... trapped due to an accident in laying the explosives... they
261 discovered the plans for operation Khamsim...
262     The plans were sent to tripoli and libyan Prime Minister Khaddaffi... soon 
263 the plans were being set into motion by Khaddaffi who believed they would flood
264 all of africa... except his little island... of terrorism...

285   The piper streched his arms to work the kinks of inactivity out of them,
286 then turned to the bard.
287   "No, I haven't seen Fast Fred around for quite a while.  Perhaps he's
288 lurking in a corner."
289   Taking a large breath, the piper let out a bellow that startled the 
290 chattering innhabitants to a momentary silence.

344   Some people came, some people went, and some that stayed put up bits
345 of their writings on the wall for others to see at a later time.
346   Over the pieces of conversations and inane spoutings that filled the
347 Inn I sat still while listening only to the voice of Emu.  His relaying
348 of the passage and tribulations of Trainor filled my ears as my eyes
349 peered into the flames that danced frivolously before the man whose
350 tale I know heard.  I sipped from the mug, and for an instant I imagined
351 that I was present at the holocaust.  I cringed at the moment the tale
352 concluded, only to be met with silence.
353   "And his fleeing this terror has brought him here?  In search of those
354 daring enough to hear him out and volunteer aid in his crusade?" I
355 asked over the crackle of the fire.
356   "Yes, that is how the situation stands.  Though many have spoken with
357 this Trainor, it remains to be seen how many of us shall attend."
358   "Ah, you are going along with them then."
359   "It would appear that a good handful of us shall.  Anything to break
360 the unending tedium of an evryday life."
361   I paused before speaking again.  Gently putting down an empty mug I
362 then said it.  "Tayree."
363   "What was that?"
364   "Tayree.  You asked me for my name and now I am giving it to you."
365   He thought for a moment before replying.  "And a befitting name it is."
366 Shortly, a crowd would gather outside to investigate the machine that
367 stood pominously outside the walls of the Inn.
368   "I, for one," stated Emu, "would like to take a closer look at this
369 device that is the cause of such calamity.  Would you care to...
370 join me, Lady Tayree?"
371   "That you have asked, and that my curiosity has been found, my
372 answer for you is yes.  I would join you."  Genuine and distilled
373 courage soon found its way bak to the door to view the marvelous
374 contraption that would prove my feeling that this would be no simple
375 risk-free jaunt.

the ordeal we went back to the jail, Obie said he was going to put us in a
387 
cell, said " Kid, I'm gonna put you in the cell I want your wallet and your
388 
belt" and I said "Obie, I can understand your wanting my wallet so I don't
389 
have any money to spend in the cell but what do you want my belt for?" and
390 
he said "Kid we don't want any hangings" I said "Obie, did you think I was
391 
going to hang myself for littering?" Obie said he was making sure, and
392 
friends, Obie was cause he took out the toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself
393 
over the head and drown, and he took out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend
394 
the bars roll out the roll of toilet paper out the window slide down the roll
395 
and have an escape.  Obie was making sure and it was about four or five
396 
hours later that Alice, remember Alice?  The song's about Alice.  Alice came
397 
by and with a few nasty words to Obie on the side bailed us out of jail and
398 
we went back to the church for another thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be
399 
beat.                                                   -Arlo

416         Dunderson fretted, As well he should. It is not everyday such a low
417 man on the Company's totem pole has quite so much responsibility. Oh he was
418 the executive assistant to the head of the Company (SAD liked the term
419 company, so what if the CIA already used it too) and he did have some
420 weight around the place, but seeing to an operation single handidly like
421 he was doing now? Dunderson was worried and with good reason. Directing
422 several agents in a cross country operation was difficult enough, but
423 this time NET was involved, and that made the task even more formidable.
424 
425         Why?, Dunderson thought to himself, why did I ever get myself into
426 this mess. I can't be expected to watch over those agents when they are
427 3000 miles away. And who can trust Joshua to make it easy for the the agents
428 to follow once he leaves Nirvana? This is all too much for one man to
429 take.
430         "Ella? Yes, I want you to book me on the next flight for San
431 Francisco. Yes, that's right. Oh no need to inform him right away. I will
432 take care of that. Yes, standard issue travel parcel. I'll pick it up
433 on my way out. Please ring me when you have confirmed reservations. Yes
434 Ella, I know what I am doing. Thank you, no, Ok, thank you. Good bye Ella."
435         It's the only way, he thought. Boss will appreciate my devotion.
436 Sure he will. I hope. 
437         <RING>
438         "Yes Ella. It leaves in 45 minutes? That is fine. Please have them
439 bring my car around. No I'll drive myself. I can use longterm parking. No
440 I will be fine. Good bye Ella."
441         That's it. Nothing more I can do now except not miss my plane. Joshua
442 will have a party waiting for him when he arrives in the bay area. I will be
443 at the head of the party. Not bad, if I do say so myself. Not bad at all.

463 I lay by the pool, enjoying the sun and the scenery.  NET keeps its R&R
464 facilities well stocked.  All it needed to make it perfect was a little
465 diversion, but that was too much to ask for.  But wait!  what's that vibration?
466 Turning my head as little as possible, I see Ian approaching.  Great,
467 someone must have heard my request for a little diversion, for here he comes.
468 As he neared, he eyed the chair sitting closest to the pool suspiciously,
469 and sat in the other one.  Pulling a file folder from his capacious pocket,
470 he opened it, scanned it briefly, then handed it to me.  
471 "while you've been a total blob here for the past several weeks, L'homme sans
472 Parity (you remember him don't you?) has been on a mission in San Francisco.
473 He is long overdue, and we haven't heard from him since shortly after he arrived
474 there.  Your job is to get down there and find him (or his body) and report
475 back here.  Everything we know about the situation is in the folder. 
476 You can leave when you are ready, as long as you're ready by tomorrow night.
477 You can browse through the garage and see if anything there is up to your
478 standards (and durable enough), or you can arrange some other transport.
479 In other words, you are, as usual, on your own.  Oh, by the way, 
480 you'll also find a little information in the folder about some new small-time
481 subversive group which has been making attempts lately at moving up in the
482 world.  Our intelligence suggests that they might try something with you.
483 whether it will be friendly or hostile, we're not sure.  Just be aware of
484 the possibility.  They'll probably turn out to be nothing more than that other
485 group, what was their name?  underground?  Anyway, keep your eyes open."
486 As he started to get up I said, "hey Ian... do the words 'deus ex machina'
487 ring a bell?"  At the sound of the key phrase, the small voice-activated
488 charge in the leg of the chair went off, tumbling Ian toward the pool.
489 As the sparks flew and I covered my head, I thought, 'its a good thing
490 I'm leaving.  They don't mind me breaking in a few of their androids,
491 but I think I'm a little too enthusiastic.  Besides, Ian would make a
492 formidable opponent, even if just on the practical joke level.'

504 Voyeur: Found the vector, but still having problems, some sort of weird
505 interaction with the keyboard. Every time I get any input from the serial
506 port it locks up the keyboard. I'm in the process of disassembling the
507 code in the 2000 to see what they do to make it work. It'll take a little
508 time, but I think I can get it figured out. I found the vector by making
509 an educated guess, and then looking for recognizable code at the address

527     
tilean surveyed the meal as it arrived... his perspective swinging as the
528 waiter approached... taking a slippery route through the other tables... at the
529 other tables lurked men in varius states of finery... turbans and veils were
530 rare... and most everyone was attired in business suits...
531     the loud din of noise from each conversation was unnerving tilean... who
532 could not seem to make out aany single voice... they all faded into one another
533 and distinguished themselves...

534     someone at his table asked if tilean was feeling ill... tilean admitted the
535 algierian food was not healthy for someone with a delicate stomache... to which
536 someone answered "and you say you do not like candied grasshoppers..."
537     loud crunching noises stopped as everyone realized what it was that they
538 had been eating... nervous glances were exchanged... everyone put down their
539 portions...

540     "europeans... i bet your mothers had to force cheese down your throat...
541 stomaches of glass... each and every-"  the arabian put a grasshopper in his
542 mouth and bit harshly... he went on... "one of you..."
543     the arabian belched loudly and everyone seemed to become rather ill...

544     "when did khadaffi get the plans for operation Khamsim..."  asked an agent
545 sitting next to the arabian... the agent looked almst nervous aboutit...
546     "the impetuous fool... he got the plans sometime in february this year...
547 it took him two weeks to realize the signifcance of it... and then the mad man
548 actually set the plan in motion once again... damned fool..."
549     tilean ignored the arabian's feelings toward khadaffi and asked how they
550 were setting the plans in motion... and where...
551     "the idiot will detonate bombs in each of fifty oil wells along the desert
552 until the sea flows far enough past the coast... that a river will form... and
553 the continent will sink... all of this done in accordance with the tides and
554 the weather... the interminable fool is going to try to sink his continent..."

555     the arabian was frustrrated at the seeming stupidity of the libyan prime
556 minister... alarmingly frustrated... although he did enjoy candied grasshoppers
557 to no end...
558     
"these wells... do we know which wells..." asked another agent who sat on
559 the other side of the arabian than the last one...
560     "the wells are nationalized and numbered one to fifty... starting with the
561 first one... offshore and going all the way to fifty... near the north bank of
562 the sand seas..."  the arabian's spirits lifted with the arrival of some green
563 leafy things... garnished with a ring of deep purple slices...

564     seeing this as a convenient time to make an exit... tilean stood and bid
565 his thanks to his host... the arabian... and asked the other agents if they
566 wished to enjoy some of the night life of algiers... he signalled them to agree
567 and come with him... in turn they all stood and exitted...
568     all five agents left the darkened and stuffy atmosphere of the restaurant
569 and were promptly blinded by the naked sun... as their eyes adjusted they began
570 to make out the fablulous traffic in this north african city... people yelling
571 at one another and offering their wares as they have been for hundreds of years
572 and more... without any significant change since the days of the barbary states
573 and before...

574 ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
575     
the arabian sat firmly... sweat began to bead on his ofrehead... and he
576 wiped it off slowly... his mind churning out comments on the agents who left
577  seconds ago... two of them were nothing significant... but the other two...
578 they were significant in that they felt... they understood the vastness of the 
579 trouble ahead...
580     only those two seemed affected by the tale of desruction that was his job
581 to tell them... and both of them seemed quite confident in their positions...

582     what were their namesns now... according to his reports... they were tilean
583 and allean... the other two were not even worth considering...

622 is that it's average tempeture is 
623 600d F. due to the thick clouds it has.
624 I'm trying to find a way to remove them. But I need all the help I can get
