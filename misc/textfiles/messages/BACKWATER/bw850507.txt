5 GENERAL DISCLAIMER: BWMS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INFORMATION
6                     PLACED ON THIS SYSTEM.
7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privately owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system. As the system is
10 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
11 I may find offensive. Because of the limited size of the system, it will be
12 periodically purged of messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
13 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out of the
14 ENTER mode. The message is automatically stored. If after entering the
15 message you find you made a mistake, use the replace command to replace
16 the line. To exit from the system, type 'OFF' then hang up.
17 Type 'HELP' to see other commands that are available on the system.

20 Marc: In response to your quiry, as has been noted before, I perfer that
21 overtly descriptive sexually based stories not be placed on BWMS, and in
22 fact I have removed them in the past. (See first 19 lines of disk please)
23 The reasoning behind this is not that I am a 'prude', but rather experience
24 has shown me that whenever I have allowed such, no matter how well written,
25 the less intellengent types have taken it to mean that BW has turned 'porno'.
26 I then have to spend the next week to a month fighting such abuse. There
27 are more then enough other 'porno' boards around town, and I have no intention
28 of allowing BW to turn into one. I have very few limits as to what I will
29 allow on BW, but sexually explict writting is one. The other reason I have
30 this restriction is that I try to keep BW open to as many different users
31 as I can, and since many are uncomfortable with such things, it is another
32 reason for such a limitation. 
33 There is no such thing as freedom, there is only the continually shifting
34 balance of one persons desires and goals against anothers. Freedom as we
35 have come to know it is when those goals and desires have reached true
36 balance. This will always mean that there will be restrictions though as
37 we give up one freedom to obtain another.

45 on a tirade regarding all the problems that were going on about
46 two weekends back. Tho my identity shall forever remain anonymous,
47 suffice it to say that I've been in these waters for 4+ years now.
48 It seems that there were a few misunderstandings generated thru
49 the actions of a single (?) individual who we (as in the collective
50 sysops of this town) would gratefully strangle.  If you haven't gathered
51 it by now, I am indeed a sysop. Again, my apologies for stepping on
52 toes.

55 Alas, after reading all that drive B: had to offer, I come away feel-
56 ing somewhat depressed.  We all of us have our good and our bad days.
57 God only knows that sometimes bad things happen to good people. To
58 whomever it was that said they felt that they had to "impress" other
59 people, I only have this to say.  We all of us must march to the beat
60 of our own drummer.  Our facades that we try so hard to create are
61 mere feathers in the wind, subject to the whimsy of nature. A single
62 puff and it's gone, revealing that which is really us. My drummer is
63 not your drummer, nor should it ever be so. I view with great trep-
64 idation the effects of all of us marching to the same drummer. Imagine!
65 a world where we were all faceless, nameless robots! <Shudder...>.
66 Cheers......Blue Beard the Pirate......

68 To the person asking about modems & baud rate:
69    The confusion is because 'baud' does NOT mean bits per second (bps).
70 The baud rate is (as I recall) a measure of how fast a signal is changing
71 state. The phone lines can only handle about 1200 *baud*. Since you need
72 TWO channels (one send & one receive) that means they only have 600 baud
73 apiece. What a 1200 *bps* modem does is have more than two STATES for the
74 signal (It uses some sort of phase-shifting arrangement) Thus each 'state
75 change' carries more than one bit of data (on a 2400 *bps* modem each one
76 carries FOUR bits of data...),
77     I hope this is of some help. If not someone else will have to help
78 as I'm at the limit of MY technical info on the subject....

112      THERE WAS ONCE A MAN CALLED FLIP WHO HAD TO SPEAK AT A SURVIVAL
113 CLUB MEETING ON TUESDAY MORNING. THE WEATHER HAS TAKEN A STRANGE 
114 TWIST WHEN HE HAD ARISEN FROM BED. THE BRITISH 303 HUNTING RIFLE LAY
115 IN THE CORNER OF THE LIVING ROOM ALONG WITH VARIOUS OF SURVIVAL 
116 EQUIPMENT HE HAD PACKED THE NIGHT BEFORE. "HMMM... " THOUGHT FLIP AS
117 HE CHECKED HIS INVENTORY BEFORE SETTING OUT TO THE CLUB..."DISTILLED
118 WATER, PURIFYING TABLETS, WATERPROOF MATCHES, FISHHOOKS & LINE,
119 SNARE WIRE, SPARE AMMO..." THE LIST WENT ON...SOON HE WAS READY FOR
120 THE LECTURE AT THE COLLEGE. THEY WANTED HIM TO SPEAK BEFORE THE
121 HUNTING SEASON STARTED FOR THE YOUNG HUNTERS WOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO
122 IF THE SITUATION AROSE THAT THEY WERE STRANDED IN THE WILDERNESS.
123 GUN IN HAND AND SURVIVAL KIT ON HIS BACK FLIP STARTED OUT HIS FRONT
124 DOOR...!WHOOOOSH!! SSSNNNAAAPPPPP!!!!! A LIGHTNING BOLT STRUCK DONE
125 AT THE SAME TIME HE STEPPED OUT...HE AWOKE ON HIS FEET IN A CLEARING
126 OF A VAST FOREST OF TALL FIRS. "WHAT THE..." SAID FLIP AS HE LOOKED
127 ABOUT HIS SURROUNDINGS. "I MUST BE DREAMING" HE THOUGHT AS HE SAT
128 DOWN TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HIS WATCH (WHICH WAS
129 ELECTRIC) WAS BURNT OUT WHEN HE LOOKED OVER HIS BODY AND EFFECTS.
130 THE CLOTHS HE WORE WERE NOT MARKED, NOR HIS HAIR BUT THE FLASHLIGHT
131 STRAPPED TO HIS BELT WAS ALSO BURNT OUT. "HMMM...I NOT DREAMING
132 AFTER ALL" HE DECIDED. "WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL FIND MY BEARINGS AND
133 TRY TO GET HOME..." HE MUTTERED TO HIMSELF WHILE ADJUSTING THE LOAD
134 HE WAS CARRYING. HE PULLED OUT THE COMPASS AND FOUND THAT IT NOTHING
135 BUT SSLOWLY MOVED AROUND POINTING IN NO PATICULAR DIRECTION. "THATS
136 STRANGE, I WONDER INF THE MAGNETIZED NEEDLE STILL WORKS..." HE DUG
137 IT OUT OF HIS KIT AND WALKED OVER TO THE SMALL STREAM FLOWING 
138 NEARBY. TAKING A BIT OF SWEAT FROM HIS FOREHEAD HE WIPED THE NEEDLE
139 WITH IT AND VERY SWLY LAYED THE NEEDLE IN A STILL POOL OF WATER. IT
140 DIDN'T POINT NORTH EITHER. WHILE PUTTING IT BACK IN THE KIT HE
141 LOOKED OUT UPON THE TERRAIN AND SPOTTED A HIGH SPOT THAT WOULD GIVE
142 HIM A BETTER LOOK OF THE COUNTRYSIDE...AFTER A 1/2 HIKE UP THE HILLS
143 HE REACHED THE POINT AND LOOKED OUT...SEEING NO SIGNS OF CIVILIZATION
144 BUT MILES OF FOREST IN ALL DIRECTIONS. SCANNING THE SKIES HE NOTICED
145 THE MOON HAD RISEN, JUST BARELY VISIBLE TO HIS LEFT. SMILING TO IT
146 HE DECICED TO WALK THAT DIRECTION INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE STREAM
147 WHICH SEEMED TO END AT THE POOL. LOOKING OFF TO RIGHT HIS JAW 
148 DROPPED OPEN AS HE NOTICED THE CLOUDS OPENING UP, A NOTICED A 
149 SECOND MOON..."THIS IS NOT EARTH" THOUGHT FLIP AS HE SAT DOWN AND
150 DUG A PINT OF WHISKEY FROM HIS KIT...

155 A British 303?  Not exactly your mainstream rifle.  I have one, but I could
156 never get its accuracy to match that of my sporterized Springfield 30-06,
157 so it's been relegated to the back of the closet as a spare.  As a 
158 "survivalist's" rifle I'm a bit sceptical - its relative scarcity means a
159 concomitant unavailability of ammunition, which is not a desirable situation
160 once "it all falls apart."  But then, not being a participant of that
161 philosophy, I could be wrong.  Maybe it's an advantage?  Whatever the case,
162 I acknowledge your use of a realistic prop in your tale.  Here's your
163 "pat on the back."

173   Frank still couldn't believe this was happening. He stood against the wall of the laundry room, shivering
174 n his damp dishwasher's uniform, with the other surviving members of
175 he hotel staff. Facing them were a dozen men dressed in olive-drab
176 uniforms complete with black ski masks, all armed with various sorts
177  submachine guns. They were waiting.
178   From the events of the last hour, Frank had arrived at one inescapable conclusion. He, and all
179 is fellow co-workers, were going to die. It was just too logical,
180 iven the situation. His heart thundered as he furiously thought

     We laughed as we exited the car, click-click we climbed the
191 
stairs.  I noticed a note on the storage area "Keep door locked".
192 
Hmmm that wasn't there earlier, As we turned to unlock our Apt. door
193 
and door across the hall flung open and our neighbor stood there,
194 
his eyes blazing with rage.  "I want to talk to you about the 
195 
"condition" of the storage area", his tone was threatening. I faced
196 
him. "Great!" I replied and continued," Let's get together and
197 
get it taken care of, you move your stuff and we will move ours."
198 
I had a smile on my face, willing to compromise. The man steamed.
199 
"I don't have time to do that, and if your stuff ever gets in my way
200 
again, Ill throw it over the balcony." Surpized at the man's attitude
201 
I entered my apt, turning saying "Hey, it's past 11:00 at night,
202 
let's discuss this in the morning when we are both a little calmer."
203 
The man growled"Ok, lady be up at 5:00 am, I have to be at work early"
204 
Odviously the man wanted to fight with me and Kristy, She took up
205 
the conversation "Sir, we waited two months before putting anything
206 
in there hoping that you would clean out a space for us. We needed
207 
to get moved into our apt, you can understand that can't you?"
208 
The man fummed and growled, insisting that we had damaged his property,
209 
left the door unlocked and our cats were too noisey.  We looked at
210 
each other(kristy and I) and said goodnight to him and closed the door.
211 
The man was persistant, screaming at us thru the door and banging
212 
on it.  We opened the door again and continued our "talk".  After a
213 
couple of minutes we realized fully just how unreasonable this man
214 
was and instructed him to consult with the management. closing the
215 
door in his face.  He did not pursure his battle with us, we could
216 
hear his door slam and we could hear the battle that he waged with
217 
his own wife. Sounds of crashing furniture and angry tougues set the
218 
mood for a dismal evening for us.  What had we done to deserve this
219 
oral thrashing and emotional upset? Oh God, why do you test your children
220 
so?

223     The cacaphony of descension drags the 'Guru' off his mountain and away from
224 the pleasent contemplation of his navel, as it so often does, to join the frey.
225 Optimal Freedom comsists of the maximum latitude for every individual up to 
226 but not passed the point ware the freedom of one would diminish the freedom of
227 another.  We have NEVER known it!  But it is realizable.  It is one of the measures of true civilization (though one 
228 of the lesser ones).  As long as the generating of stress and of mundaness con-
229 tinue to be socialy acceptable true freedom will not be atained.  (The pre-
230 meditated generating thereof i mean)
231      As to God vs 'gods':  The Unknowable Essence has ever been and ever remains
232 exaulted beyond comming ins and going outs.  The revealers, the major dawning
233 points of manifestation, have one and all proclaimed Him to be singular though
234 unknowable.  Thair so called fallowers,
235 on the other hand, have often found
236 vested interest in maintaining confusion
237 on that issue.  The pronoun 'He' is used to refer to the Causer of Causes, not
238 as an indication of biomorphic polarity, such is absured by deffinition in 
239 connection with an infinatly exaulted
240 supreme being, but rather as default of
241 a language which lacks a pronoun for 
242 a non-physical and thus non physicaly
243 polarised scentient.  Of course other
244 interpretations are possible and far
245 be it from me to set myself up as thair
246 final arbeture.  i simply pass on what
247 little understanding i have of the 
248 latest 'chapter' of this continual outpouring of Devine will.

259   Marc -- Although I have been enjoying "Blackout" very much, I must agree
260 with Mikey that you are coming very close to a fine line of acceptibility
261 for BW.  (I'm sure you're aware of that already, your comment proves that
262 you are not unaware of the sensitivity of others here.)  So far the writing
263 has been excellent, the situation not completely unbelievable, and the
264 responses of the characters, while not perhaps enlightening as to great
265 universal truths, not unrepresentative of at least some specimans of humanity.
266   The story has been succussful insofar as it has raised erotic expectations
267 although no explicit sexual descriptions have occurred, however it seems that
268 nearly all who have read the story fear that the action will quickly turn
269 from the fine line of erotically stimulating to clinical.  I, for one, would
270 prefer to see you hold on the "socially acceptable" side -- a difficult path
271 to tread, and one frought with treacherous traps that could destroy your story.
272 If more than a single erotic incident is involved -- if the persons involved
273 learn more about themselves or the world around them, please, please continue
274 but try to keep away from clinical descriptions.  If the single incident is
275 all that occurrs, my imagination has already filled in the rest.
276 pppppppppppppppppp
277   The piper turned to a table where a large, hiristute (sp? I misplaced the
278 damn dictionary!) individual had called out.  A flash of polished tin caugh
279 the pipers eye reminding him strongly of a past adventure and a mental picture
280 of two gentlemen who normally inhabited a spy-story reality walking arm-in-arm
281 down a yellow brick road singing an old Judy Garland song nearly brought a
282 tear to his eye.  Ah, yes, the tin man was not involved in the incident --
283 our minds weave strange associative webs sometimes.  The piper sat as
284 bigfoot began his story.

286 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
287     Marc:  I, for one, find your story amusing.  I don't consider it offensive,
288 and if I did, I could always not read it.  Since you clearly identify yourself,
289 why don't those who don't like his story just skip reading it?  Be a little
290 user-friendly for a change, instead of just talking about it (all of you who
291 jump on the "user-friendly month" have a continuing tendency to leave messages
292 exhorting others to do what you say, not what you actually do...

306              "BLACKOUT"          Final Episode
307    It was shortly after midnight when the lights went on, more blinding than
308 the darkness that it erased.  They staggered to their feet---two strangers
309 who had done almost everything that a man and woman can do to each other--
310 and they dressed, exchanging neither word nor glance.  Within five minutes,
311 they were on the Portland Mall.
312     He found her a taxi. "Can I drop you off anywhere?" she asked, hoping
313 that he'd say no. "
314                  He shook his head.
315       "I'll take the Bus."
316    But handing her into the cab, he paused.
317       "Are you sure you'll be okay?"
318    For the first time that night, he spoke with geniune concern.  For the 
319 first time that night, she looked into his face.
320       "I'll be okay." she said.
321    He took her hand and shook it--two business acquaintances at the  eend of
322 a long tiring meeting.
323    "It's been..."--he was sudden;ly awkward--"it's been nice knowing you."
324    Her last glimpse was of a figure in a crumpled business suit, disappearing
325 into the steps of a Tri-Met bus.

333           My life fades in and out. My thoughts are passionate like the rage of
334 a wild fire, they're the pain of the single flame that licks about inside me.
335 They are often detached and my mind dwells in a nebulous haze that qualifies as
336 something other than reality.
337           My breath condenses on the window to the world, then it evaporates
338 and reappears. I look out at the people beyond the glass. There's a war
339 between them. They have no weapons, but they are fighting each other, although
340 they don't seem to realize  it. Either that or they don't care. Every once in a
341 while a person will fall, they'll fade away. And people will wonder what 
342 happened. They really do care.

350 Opening the sealed flaps that contained the device within, Kosta prepared all
351 settings before initializing the power-up proceedure.

371        "What in God's good name has happened here?  Why, you blasted infernal
372 contraption!  You have failed me!  I shall see about that!"  In a flurry,
373 Kosta checked and recheck the settings of the device to verify that all was
374 as it should be.  Everything on the outside appeared to be in fully operational
375 order.  When he came to reset the power switch it finally dawned on him that 
376 an internal working had somehow malfunctioned, and that it would most likely
377 not be in fully operational status without having it checked into by one of
378 the technicians back at the labs. The word 'infernal' kept spewing from Kosta's
379 lips.  Delicately, he powered off the machine and replaced it in its black
380 leather case to be carried as a reminder that he had at least deprived the rest
381 of one of their impliments of location.  Kosta then shouldered his large bag
382 of contents and left the aircraft after having punctuered the wings and
383 setting a small fire downhill from it...  He would be a safe distance before
384 the fireworks would go off.

398 	The radiant bride was gay. She had never been so happy in all of her
399 life. She had met her 'knight in shining armour.' Setting her cap for him,
400 she had won his love, znd knew they would make their marriage a blissful and
401 happy one.
402 	The bride was gay. She stared in the oval mirror on the wall in her
403 bedroom, tiny beads of perspiration forming under her nose and on her
404 forehead. She had blanketed her sexual preferences for years and was now
405 about to commit a crime against herself, as well as her husband-to-be. But
406 she would go through with it-her cold blue eyes staring back at her told
407 her she had to.
408 
409 	My brother is cool. He can pop a wheely for almost a whole block!
410 Also, he talks Mom and Dad into anything, pays me 25 cents to clean his
411 room, and has his own walkie-talkie with his best friend, Herb. He's the
412 best brother I ever had!
413 	My brother is cool. The fever has been gone for two days now, and
414 he has slipped into a coma. His cheeks are pale and thin. His eyes are
415 always closed. The stale smell of medicines and antiseptics are beginning
416 to nauseate me when I walk into his room. It'll be over soon.
417 
418 	My teacher is neat. He tells funny jokes, but always in the wrong
419 order: introduction, conclusion, and the story-line filled in at the end.
420 At first, he scared me with his untameable hair and heard and his high,
421 hoarse voice, but now I can see that his bark is much worse than his bite.
422 He is a good teacher and I have learned much from him.
423 	My teacher is neat. Everything on his desk is in perfect order. His
424 papers are stacked just 'so-so,' his books are lined on a shelf like
425 soldiers on parade, and the pictures on the walls coordinate. Little dust
426 germs don't stand a chance against his meticulous cleaning. I hear they
427 are going to stage a rebellion, though, and put a stop to the polishes,
428 insectisides, and air fresheners. I don't know whose side I'll be on. I
429 think I'll put my money on the germs.

433 Mikey: Copylink works on the IBM PC/AT! (Big surprise eh?) This is under
434 DOS 3.0, using a Hayes 1200 baud modem. I called a few BBS systems, down-
435 loaded a file, and tried out a very simple script for 'attack dialing.'
436 I have encountered no problems yet, EXCEPT... (you knew there had to be
437 an except didn't you?) Once in a great while, after leaving terminal mode
438 to say, help or command mode, the first word that is printed is missing
439 its first characters. I can't explain it, and there appeared to be no
440 ryhme or reason to the occurrence. Any ideas? (I know this is VERY minor,
441 but as a judicious tester, I wanted to report EVERYTHING) I'll be doing
442 much more testing, and I will of course report everything that happens,
443 or doesn't happen! Thanks for the wumpus program on the previous disk.

460 
461      FLIP TOOK A LONG PULL AT THE PINT OF WHISKEY AS HE TRIED TO FIGHT
462 THE FEELING OF FEAR THAT WAS WASHING OVER HIM. THE WHISKEY SLOWLY CALMED
463 HIS NERVES AND STEADIED HIS HANDS WHILE HE CONTIMPLATED HIS SITUATION...
464 "I'M ON A DIFFERENT PLANET, DON'T KNOW ANYONE AND CAN'T SEE CIVILIZATION
465 FOR MILES" SAID FLIP ALOUD, REMEMBERING THE OLD BOY SCOUT RULES OF WHAT TO
466 DO WHEN LOST. "AT LEASE I DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE FED'S ANY MONEY THIS YEAR!"
467 HE THOUGHT AS HE ATE SOME OF THE RATIONS IN HIS KIT. THERE WAS ENOUGH TO
468 LAST HIM A WEEK AND THERE SEEMED TO BE PLENTY OF WATER AVAILABLE. WISHING
469 THAT HE HAD SOME COMPANY HE BEGAN THE LONG JOURNEY TO 'SOMEWHERE'...AFTER
470 WALKING FOR A FEW HOURS HE NOTICED THAT THE TREES WERE THINING SOMEWHAT,
471 AND THE BEGININGS OF A TRAIL WEAVED THROUGH THE TREES. WHISTLING A OLD
472 SONG HE CONTINUED ON THRU THE DAY FOLLOWING THE TRAIL WINDING DOWN THE
473 ROLLING HILLS INTO A LARGE VALLEY THAT STREACHED TO THE LIMITS OF HIS
474 SIGHT. NEARING NIGHTFALL HE DECIDED TO BREAK CAMP NEAR A SMOOTH FACE
475 OF GRANITE, USING THAT AS A REFLECTOR HE BUILT HIS SMALL TEPEE FIRE AND
476 PROCEEDED TO EAT A LIGHT DINNER. THE BIRDS SANG SWEETLY AS THEY FLITTED
477 THROUGH THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES NEAR HIM..."QUITE A LOVELY LAND I SEEM
478 TO BE IN" THOUGHT FLIP AS HE STRETCHED OUT NEAR THE FIRE. THE TWO MOONS
479 LIT UP THE COUNTRYSIDE LIKE TWO LAMPPOSTS ON OPPOSITE STREET CORNERS, 
480 ENABLING HIM TO SEE PERFECTLY THAT NIGHT. WAKING FROM A FITFUL DREAM
481 FLIP NOTICED THAT THE FIRE HAD DIED DOWN REMAINING ONLY AS A FEW WARM
482 COALS OF HEAT. AFTER ADDING MORE TWIGS AND SMALL 'SQUAW WOOD' THE FIRE
483 RETURNED TO ITS BRILLIANCE IN THE NIGHT LIGHT...SUDDENLY FLIP NOTICED
484 MOVEMENT AT THE CORNER OF HIS EYE. QUICKLY HE UNSLUNG THE 303 AND READY
485 THE CLIP FROM HIS POCKET, WONDERING IF THE SHADOW HE SAW WAS A MAN OR
486 SOMETHING ELSE...WATCHING IT APPROACH HE PULLED UNLOADED THE RIFLE AND
487 SET IT TO ONE SIDE...AND WAITED FOR THE STRANGER TO ENTER HIS CAMP IN
488 PEACE...

494 It was a cold morning. Too cold to be out and about, but be that as it 
495 may, Josh still had to be there.  Grumbling to the great gods in the sky,
496 muttering about the -10 degree weather, he climbed into the cockpit.
497 "Hmph. Damn thing just doesn't want to start this morning. Perhaps a 
498 little fuel in the carb might work.".  Dumping three capfuls of booster
499 into the carb, Josh pulled himself back into the cockpit. Whirrrrr. Whirrr.
500 Click. Click. Kathunk. Finally. The engine engaged. Taxiing down the runway,
501 Josh knew he had a long day ahead. That run back to Aleut was going to be
502 a tough one, especially if the weather didn't clear up, and soon. The radio
503 reports indicated a gut-busting flurry coming down from the pole. Josh
504 didn't think to highly of this, and moaned out loud when the radio
505 crackled "Josh, honey, you ok this morning?" His wife. Of course. Josh
506 had to put in that two-way radio to pacify his wife. "Yeah, Sandy, I'm
507 doing fine.".  "Uh, Josh, you sure you don't wanna wait to make that
508 run?". "Nah. Gotta get it done. The boys up there need me as soon as
509 possible, can't afford to wait any more.". "Ok. But you just be very
510 careful. I don't wanna hear that your little 180 went down in the middle
511 of the sea somewhere. That just terrifies me.".

528 __________________________________________________________________________
529    when two people live under the same roof for long enough they begin to
530 have an edge of concern and maybe even a little possesiveness.  after only
531 a short passage of time you begin to feel as if you have known each other
532 for all of your life.  at least that is how i feel.  something else will
533 happen as well.  when the two are around each other for so long they start
534 to share some concepts even if they do not fully believe in them or are
535 able to comprehend them fully. i can tell that this has in some manner had
536 an effect on me as well because there was a time not too long ago that i
537 would feel no pause or inhibition what so ever in responce to effusion.
538 the next thing i know is i am hesitating.  it is not me that waits but an
539 ideal that has been expressed by the other one.  it is not me.  it passed.
540      after many long minutes of talking about how the office was not such
541 a nice thing that one could look forward to going there in the morning we
542 got down to what was on each others minds of late.  at first we had both
543 appologized what we both felt were our rudenesses and inconsiderations.
544 as it turns out neither one of us felt the burden of the others worry but
545 only our own repressions.  the subject inadvertantly came to how i felt
546 about myself and the break up i just went through.  with all the grace and
547 wisdom i could muster i created my disertation.  the first words were an
548 explaination that i was quoting off the top of my head from a letter i had
549 just written.  then i went on to say that even though it was not an easy
550 time i was not so effcted by the release as were the others that were now
551 on my mind.  i knew it had to end because i should never have let it 
552 start.  it was smoething i have already learned i would never allow happen
553 again and that i felt nothing of it anymore because i knew that the one i
554 had let go was now very much more in love with the one i was only a 
555 diversion from.  i was then told that i was indeed wise.
556 i am not wise.  i am a fool.  i lied.  i did still feel something but not
557 much anymore.  inwardly i turned my back on the situation and looked 
558 forward to the happier days i would spend in the future.  but all i feel
559 is the now.  tomorrow never comes.  it is always beyond my grasp.  pain is
560 the price we pay for our educations and i am ready for my next lesson.

564 *WOW*
565 AFTER READING THE AMOUNT OF TEXT THAT HAS BEEN ADDED ON SINCE LAST 
566 NIGHT IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY THE LINES HAVE BEEN BUSY ALL AFTERNOON
567 AND EVENING. ABOUT THAT PARTIAL STORY 'UNDERCOVER';
568 I AM A COMPLETE NEWCOMER TO BBS'S AND DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO
569 OPERATE THEM. I HAVE THE STORY, ALL WRITTEN UP, ON DISK. I TRIED 
570 TO DO IT THE EASY WAY BY LOADING PART OF THE STORY INTO
571 A MEMORY BUFFER AND THEN LOADING THE WHOLE MESS ONTO THE BOARD.
572 THE PROCESS GOT ABOUT AS FAR AS IS LISTED UP ON THE BOARD NOW
573 AND THEN STARTED GIVING BACK STRANGE, SCREWY CHARACTERS.
574 I ABORTED THE LOADING PROCESS AND TRIED TO DELETE THE INFORMATION
575 ALREADY ENTERED. AFTER THINKING I HAD ALREADY DONE SO, I LISTED AGAIN AND
576 DISCOVERED TO MY MORTIFICATION THAT THE LINES WERE STILL ON THE 
577 BOARD AND I HAD NO WAY TO ELIMINATE THEM!! AAAARRRGGGHHH!!!
578 THIS IS VERY EMBARASSING AND NO DOUBT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL.
579 ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED, AND THAT
580 I AM NOT A FLAKE WHO IS JUST TRYING TO MESS UP THE SYSTEM
581 THIS STORYTELLING BUSINESS LOOKS TO BE A LOT OF FUN AND I WOULD LIKE 
582 TO PARTICIPATE. HOWEVER, IT LOOKS LIKE I'LL HAVE TO ENTER ALL
583 MY STUFF MANUALLY (LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, NO DOUBT) SO IT MAY TAKE AWHILE
584 I WOULD STILL LIKE TO SEE 'UNDERCOVER' UP ON THE BOARD BUT I THINK
585 I'LL WAIT UNTILL IT'S A LITTLE LESS CROWDED. I DON'T KNOW HOW
586 MUCH ROOM IS LEFT ON THE BOARD BUT MY 'CHAPTERS' TEND TO RUN 1/2 TO 1 1/2
587 SINGLE SPACED PAGES TYPED.
588 I THINK THE STORY WILL BE WORTH IT.
589 TO THE SYSOP: I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION ON GRAPHIC SEX, BUT
590 HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GRAPHIC VIOLENCE AND LANGUAGE IF IT
591 FITS THE CONTEXT OF THE STORY? MY STORIES DON'T HAVE MUCH SEX
592 BUT LOTS OF LANGUAGE AND VIOLENCE AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
593 HOW MUCH I WOULD HAVE TO CENSOR THEM IN ORDER NOT TO BE PURGED
594 FROM THE BOARD.
595 IT'S 4:15 A.M. 5/9 AND I THINK I'VE SAID ENOUGH FOR ONE NIGHT.
596 STAY MELLOW, AND I'LL C U ALL SOON.
