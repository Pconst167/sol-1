20 line 19 line 19 is not the top just for today -  I'm just here to browse. ~
21 Hah! Some neophite is priveledged to enter in at the top, while an experienced
22 traveller such as myself just misses, and never having done it, regrets the
23 near miss of immortality. And it's Halloween no less...
24 ((((((((((((((((((*)))))))))))))))))

26 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
27 The Bear froze for the slightest moment, mesmerized by the huge evil eye
28 staring at him from the end of the tiny cave. His mind seemed to wander into 
29 an endless pool of evil, his mind swirled within him, and he began to lose his
30 grip on the sword.
31 
32 Suddenly, the eye pulled back, and where there had been a deep pool of green-
33 colored evil, there was only the faint red glow of a huge grotto beyond. Bear
34 could only see a bit of it, but it's enormity could be detected by the look of
35 the wall on the other side. His forehead dripped with sweat, his nose was
36 filled with the overpowering smell of not just sulphur, but the decadence of
37 the purest evil along with it.
38 
39 The mist slowly started to clear from his brain, and quickly! he shook his head.
40 He stared around him, and realized that only a few seconds had past, although
41 they had seemed like hours. He put his body into motion with all the power he
42 could muster. Holding his sword in front of him, he crawled backwards through
43 the tunnel, face down. His feet grabbed the stoney ground, his elbows pressed
44 himself backward as quickly as his body could take him. His breath came in
45 short, raspy gasps, his skin crawled with the anticipation of what was to come,
46 and his brain whirled with plans of action. But there was none, except scurrying
47 back through the darkness as quickly as he could.
48 
49 Just as the walls began to widen, and he realized he could get up on all fours
50 and turn around, it came. He could hear the drawn-in breath. He could see a
51 brighter flickering of light from the entrance in front of him, the entrance he
52 was so desparately trying to back away from. He had only seconds. He lay flat
53 on the ground, sword held vertically in front of his head. He ground his face
54 into the rock, and held his breath
55 tightly. He held the jeweled handle of his sword against his head. And waited.
56 
57 An eternal split second later, the fire from the mouth of the dragon of
58 Fendarr rushed through the small tunnel. The flames danced through the cave,
59 pushed through the small passageway by the force of the dragon's breath, and
60 drawn by the hunger for air waiting
61 at the end its journey.
62 
63 The flames enveloped the Bear, and he screamed in desperate agony.

67 	And while ignoring cretins who hid their multiply disturbed personalities with unsigned UPPERCASE messages,
68 L'homme turned to his companions at the inn and said:
69 Piper: Thanks for the codes. The movie program is now working. I was having some problems with the character packing
70 routine in my DRWABS(x,y) function that were stripping the wrong codes and turning them into 20H. They are fixed now
71 and all I need to do is automate the MODE select for the 4107 and go to work getting some animation going. Thanks much
72 for your help.
73 Mikey: Better try for next Thursday at the PCS social. I will bring the old archive disks. Do you have any new archive

80    "Snap out of it Trainor! We have come too far to let vindictiveness stop us
81 now." Cragmore's voice was calm, yet it carried the feeling of tremendous
82 emotion just under the surface.
83    The worried looks of Emu and Bard told the rest of the tale. Trainor was
84 still in an incensed state after realizing the lady zeb was the last link
85 to the entity that had destroyed his planet. Feelings of total retribution
86 filled his mind with macabre forms of revenge on the woman who now lay only
87 a few meters away behind a door that Trainor could not enter.
88    Cragmore looked away from Trainor, still struggling against the restraints
89 that kept him immobile, to the others in the small chamber. "We must convince
90 him of the futility in extracting revenge on zeb. It is imperative that he
91 make the last step alone, but we are responsible for getting him to the point
92 where he can make a rational decision about the situation."
93    "I understand" Bard said nodding. "We could try reasoning with him, but I
94 doubt that in his condition reason makes much sense."
95    "Cragmore?" Emu's face flashed with insight. "Couldn't we use some form of
96 psi link to reach Trainor's subconscious? I know a little about psi and I
97 think by cutting through the emotional conscious layers of his mind we could
98 give much more convincing arguments against killing zeb."
99    "Yes...Yes! We must try, and there is no time to waste. Quickly, form the
100 semi-circle. Trainor will occupy the last quadrant of the curve. Now
101 concentrate on reaching Trainor. His body lays in bed but his mind is free
102 to come unto us. Concentrate. Concentrate!"
103    
104    Once again, although no one in the room would notice it, a glow arose from
105 the assemblage of men, seated on the floor, forming three quarters of a
106 psi-circle. The last and most important part of the circle was still
107 physically tied to the bed, but the slower breathing and calm look revealed
108 that the attempt was having some effect. Absolute silence washed over the
109 room. The human mind speaks far louder than the human mouth will ever be
110 able to.

122    James felt like somebody had just let the air out of him. He was silent for a long time. Finally He spoke. "That's
123 a crock."
124    "There's no choice. You must do it."
125    "You seem awfully anxious to go to your final reward."
126    Tariya's face was open, full of fear. "There will be no final reward. Under these circumstances my conciousness
127 will simply dissipate as the sphere winks out of existance."
128    James sighed. "I should have known. It almost happened to me, once. That's probably why soulpower is so forbidden
129 to use. It's a very simple choice."
130    She was close to tears again. "Please. You're the Destroyer. There must be a dozen, no, a hundred ways you could do
131 it. Quickly. Painlessly. It shouldn't bother you. You've done it before."
132    He had turned away, staring into the wall. "Yes. I have, haven't I?" His mind was spinning in tight little circles,
133 endlessly going over his options and finding the same results.
134    "It... it WAS my fault. It's only right-"
135    "You're trying to justify murder. Tell me," James whipped around suddenly with something in his hand. "is THIS what
136 you really want?"
137    In his hand was a sword. His weapon, and the main focus of his destructive powers. It had no scabbard, nor did it
138 need one, as it only existed at his command. The blade was twenty inches long, single edged, and curved like a samurai
139 sword. Sparks of blue fire raced along its edge.
140    Tariya knew all about the sword, of course. It was an integral part of the legend of the Destroyer. Still, she was
141 mesmerized by the sight. Her eyes locked on the tip, following its every slight movement, like a bird paralyzed by a
142 cobra that was about to strike. With an effort she broke the spell and locked eyes with James. "It's not what I want,
143 but it has to be done. If you cannot do it, then give me the blade."
144    "Sure." He said. He held it up to her, by the grip. her hand closed around the wooden grip, and his hand closed on
145 hers, cold as ice and sweating. They held each other's eyes and for a second seemed to share... something. Then he let
146 go.
147    As soon as his skin broke contact with the sword, it dissappeared. Tariya stared down at her empty hand.
148    "As soon as I let go of it, it goes back where it came from." he said. "I can't lose it or have it used against me
149 that way."
150    She was still looking a her hand. Finally she looked up and said, "Then you must do it."
151    They both heard a hollow groan, sounding like a rotten building that was about to collapse. The size of the sphere
152 shrank perceptably. It wouldn't be long.
153    She watched as the animation drained out of his face. His voice was just as flat as his expression. "I guess I have
154 no choice."

170 
171 WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR PET DIES
172      When you find your dog on the front porch stiff, the first thing you 
173 do is kick it
174  
175 to be shure it's dead but sense you've done this so many times you kick it 
176 again, harder this time.  From the blow it just recived it rolls off the 
177 porch and into the flower bed. You hear no wimpering nor thrashing, now you
178 are pretty shure that the dog is dead, but just to be shure you get a milk
179 bone and throw it to the spot where the dog lies; the flower bed is still 
180 silent, there are no chomping or scoffing sounds heard when the dog usualy
181 inhales a milk bone. Now you have to keep away the kids so that they don't 
182 see the dog with a milk bone resting on it. For they to know how much the 
183 dog loves milk bones. While the kids are harrasing someone else you put the 
184 dog in the wash machine to get it all cleaned up, but don't put it on the 
185 spin cycle because you might spin some pretty bad stuff out of it. Take this
186 clean dead dog to your local taxidedrmist and have the dog stuffed in a 
187 sleeping position. Take this clean dead stuffed dog home and put it into the
188 corner. When the kids come by tell them; "The dog is very sick so leave it 
189 alone." Now you have sucessfully avoided telling your kids about the death 
190 of their favorit canine. You still have to keep their attention away from 
191 the dog by getting another pet like a cute kitten, rat, snake, eel, black-
192 widow, ect. You will never have to tell them about another pet death again
193 it also works good for relatives.

198         ROCK AGAINST RELIGION
199 
200 Absolutely dishusting. Plebian attempts at humor merely demonstrate the
201 inability of the writer to captivate a thought and transfer it to the
202 written word. Sometimes things are better left unsaid. Sometimes writers
203 are better left decapitated.
204 ---------------------------------------
205         ROCKER AGAINST RELIGION
206 ^C
207 ---just wond-ring..... isn't it that rock is just another form of religion???
208 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
209 The searing fire rushed through the cave, swirling over and around the Bear.
210 All he could do was grit his teeth in pain, trying to be careful not to breath
211 in the flames. The smell of his scorched hair filled his nostrils, his skin
212 sizzled with the heat, searing him with the greatest pain he had ever felt.
213 
214 But still, he kept the sword held vertically in front of him. His hands first
215 reddened, and then blackened as they confronted the force of the blast.
216 
217 He felt like he had roasted eternally. He felt like he had tasted Hell, and it
218 had consumed him and given him pain that could not be endured for one more
219 second, much less an eternity. He pressed his face into the ground as hard as
220 he could, his eyes closed, his teeth clenched, his entire body wreathed in
221 agony. His sword glowed. His hands shook while he held it, but still it stood,
222 turning a pale red as the flames whirled around it.
223 
224 And it was over. The flames stopped, but the sounds of its destruction filled
225 the air. The Bear's skin sizzled, his body smoked, saliva dripped from the
226 trembling mouth. The stench of burned flesh attacked the air around him.
227 The Bear slowly raised his head, eyes squinting at first, but gradually opening
228 to make out his surroundings. The sword still glowed above him, even redder
229 than before. And Bear knew it was that which had saved his life, for the sword
230 had gathered as much heat as it could stand, taking away enough to save Bear's
231 life.
232 
233 And as he looked up, he saw down the tunnel, farther away now, but with enough
234 size and glow to impact his brain with a force like magic, was the eye. The
235 dragon was once again gazing into the cave. And it saw Bear, still alive.
236 
237 And it glowed red around the green, and the eye seemed to spit fire.
238 
239 Bear's muscles groaned and his skin crackled as he urged himself to stand. A
240 roar came from the grotto in front of him, and the eye again disappeared,
241 quickly. And Bear knew the flames would come once again as he turned and ran.

247 Have you ever wondered why just about everyone says "hello?" when they 
248 answer the phone?  Well, I have.  And I'm intent on putting a stop to it.
249      We humans should be able to muster a bit more creative inginuity and
250 form some snappy welcome to the friend or wrong-number dialer on the other
251 end of the fiber optics.  We have the wit, so let's use it.
252 
253      I personnaly say something like:

256            or
257        "Emergency red-line..."
258            or pose the question

267     Yup.  Whoever said it above.  Whenever an 'anti-religeon' posture is taken
268 that isn't an anti religeon; its just another one Religeons become anti-religeon
269 s over time when they go sour and pervert.  But even then thair not realy 
270 effective anti OTHER religeons.  Rather they become the anti-religeon of
271 themselves!

303     "A pen with pigment! In the stead of ink? What an idea,"  Exclaimed the
304 Sage.  Obviously the idea excited the Sage who was quite tired of dipping
305 his pens in ink every few words.
306     "Yes, and it only cost three or four marks,"  Said the Stationaire, in
307 his brisk accent.  Eyes peering out of thick glasses, and fingers nimbly
308 twisting the pens in his fingers.
309     "You are trying to raise the price,"  Remarked the Sage wisely, almost
310 happily.  A smile crinkled his eyes, and his fingers deftly picked up six
311 pens in succession.  Dropping a mark after each one.
312     "No, it simply costs three marks, no less,"  Said the Stationaire in
313 good form as a miser.  No smile crinkled his eyes, greed squinted his eyes.
314     "Oh,"  Said the Sage.  Ashamed of having changed this deal from one
315 between friends and colleagues, into one between banker and widow.  His
316 eyes met the floor and his monies dropped onto the table.
317 
318     "Yes, this is the profit,"  Stationaire was pleased with this.
319     "A profit, eh?  A profit,"  Sage was disappointed at only receiving a
320 trio of pens, and at seeing the greed of a friend.
321     The pens certainly did expedite work on the play, and by that winter,
322 nearly enough money to buy the other pens had accumulated.  The scene
323 between the two colleagues that winter was nearly as pathetic as the one
324 described here.

376 How about: "Joe's Pool Hall. Who in the hall do you want?"
377 OR
378 "Heaven. God speaking!"
379 
380 or just answer it panting hard and say 
381 "WHAT?"
382 
383 or the best one is, if it's late at night or you answer it sleepy and the othe
384 r person asks "Oh, did I wake you up?"
385 Say "No, I was asleep anyway."
386 
387 Nine times out of ten the caller will say "Oh, that's good," assuming that
388 you answered the way he/she expected you to.

403 After what seemed to be only several hours later, I woke up.  My head
404 behaved itself instead of hurting as it should ha after seventeen rounds of
405 that ethanol-enriched drink, which surprised me.
406 I looked at my watch, stared at the date.  Two days after our little party.
407 I scanned the room, found what I knew must be there.  A note from the Doctor
408 and Milchar.  I opened it up and read:
409 'Dear Bert,
410    Milch left on some sort of errand he had to finish, and I was called back
411 to Gallifrey on business.  I'm sorry we can't be around when you wake up, but
412 I'm sure you won't mind.  Oh, yes, a friend of yours  showed up yesterday.
413 You'll find him in the commons room.
414                                         the Doctor'
415 I got up and dressed, then made my way quickly down to the commons room.  A
416 familiar face looked up from his hot breakfast and smiled at me.

425 Ok, let's get something straight.  Murphy was an optimist.  But, he was
426 not as far seeing as many people would have you believe.  Murphy dictated
427 a set of "laws", but, he did not include anything about the panorama of
428 inevitable happenings.
429     In other words, Murphy did not include any secondary considerations.
430 That is, Laws that the Laws follow.
431     Of course, there is a reason he did not include any such.  And that 
432 is that these considerations change for each person.  Like a thump-print,
433 everyone has there own, no two alike.
434     
435     Mine own, include the following:
436 
437    1:  When I go to the Supermarket, my shoes inevitably come untied.  
438 But, always my left Converse High-Top, never my right.
439    2:  Furthermore, I always pick the shopping-cart with only the LEFT
440 side wheels messed-up.  Always only the left.
441 
442    There are others, but why go into that here?  I have two qeustions:
443 Firstly; What is this left-affliction?  Does it have something to do
444 with my brain? (As in Monte Python's Grundy, "MY BRAIN HURTS!")  Or is
445 it something more unique, perhaps even of Cosmic Reletivity?
446 
447 Secondly; Does anyone else experiance such occurances?  Surely there are
448 some, surely I am not alone in this!?!
449 
450      Well, in any case, it's something to think about...

469 Well, everyone, I'm back. I've been in the hospital for some time, and I've
470 learned a great deal about the way I was, and all te terrible things that I 
471 have done to so many innocent young children. I know what all of you thougt
472 of me from the messages that were left for me, and I can only hope that you
473 can find it in your hearts to forgive me. I no longer have those terrible 
474 desires, they shocked that out of me at the hospita and I am cured. I am no 
475 longer a threat to society. Will you please give meanother chance to be your
476 friend? I promise I will never ask any of you to le me baby sit for your 
477 children again, as I know you may not trust me at first. Is there anyone ou
478 t there that will still speak to me? Remorsefully, FRANK

491   I LOOK AT THE PHYSICAL forces of the universe and understand that this is
492 the word of god, gods laws and gods word, is not the evolutionary forces
493 on this planet of earth, gods law also; increasing complexity and 
494  conscious awareness, that is evolution of intelligence, I realise that
495 we must know all about the innerworkings of the human mind, just like
496 you know the operating system to a computer, and its the innerworkins of
497 a microprocessor chip. What and why are some people not aware of thier
498 own emotions, state of mind, thier reasoning ability, imagination, 
499 fantasy, dreams,limitations of senses in the physical world, some 
500 people do not have a vocabulary or awarness to describe thier base
501 feelings, where has this culture failed in such a great and grand
502 economy and such great opportunity to develop? My life span is but a
503 drop in the ocean, a microsecond in the process of evolutionary time,
504 what kind of intellence will appear next on this earth during
505 mellenia? Please god i appeal to you, dont let me fall, but continue
506 onwards in developing my awareness of the abilities of others and
507 myself and guard me from those who will try to steer me off the 
508 path into ignorance and destruction......The Mind.

560 	If that was the real FRANK then PAM is a white witch and Mohammad
561 Wassir is a cop! How on earth could you people be so easily fooled by this
562 poor attempt at imitating Frank's tendancies. A few clues to watch for next
563 time this new FRANK dares appear. First of all, Frank's messages were all
564 64 columns or less, being related to the brand of computer he used. All of
565 Frank's messages were first typed in on a word processor and then uploaded
566 to Backwater. I do not recall when Frank ever made a typo or spelling error
567 that wasn't related to a problem with his upload. Secondly, Frank's feelings
568 were firmly engrained into his psyche. It would take much more than electro-
569 shock treatment to dissolve these tendancies in Frank. Someone has been
570 watching 'Cuckoo's Nest' again. Electro-shock treatment is not used on
571 child molesters unless they show other forms of neurotic behavior directly
572 connected with the center in the brain that shock therapy moderates. Thirdly,
573 why should the real Frank come begging back to this place? A place where he
574 was threatened with physical violence and torture is not the first place a
575 'recovered' patient would return to. Seeing the lack of temperance on this
576 system would certainly steer Frank far away towards calmer more mature
577 waters. Be assured that Frank is still Frank, and FRANK is nothing but a
578 cheap fraud, hardly worth the millivolts used to enter his dispicable
579 missive.

599 Like all abnormal people, lefties have tendencies toward the unusual.
600 It is a known fact that most rapists are either left-handed or would
601 have had a tendency toward it if their mother's hadn't steered them
602 otherwise. It's also well known that left-handedness is a sure sign of
603 self-love and inflated pride.
604 
605 Frank was probably left-handed.

610 	Left handed people are just the same as you and I, they just write
611 with their left hand.  They don't have the definite split of right brain and
612 left brain but the emotional responces are just the same as what people would
613 call Normal.  Wasn't a extra y chromozone connected with all of the murderers?
614 	Now, what about people who can either write with their left hand or
615 their right hand because to them there is no difference, what about them?  are
616 you going to call them half-murderers?  But the problem there is that they are
617 also right handed, although people have two seperate brains in their heads you
618 can't call half of a person a murderer without insulting the other half.
619 	Just a thought:  Research has shown that babies that prefer to lie
620 on their right side will turn out being left handed and the other way around.
621 Babies haven't been around long enough for outside influences to govern which
622 side they like to sleep on.  So if a babie ends up being left handed would you
623 say it was inherited from the parents?  And what if this same babie turns out
624 to be an axe killer in a subway, will you say it was inherited?
