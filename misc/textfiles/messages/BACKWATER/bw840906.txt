23 I am indeed fortunate to be the first one on this disk; a rare
24 pleasure!  Are there any new topics for discussion as of yet?
25 I, for one, would like to see something about the current state
26 of research on the subject of chaos nd the scientific study
27 thereof.  Any takers?

44 	The Guardswoman (words: Anne Wilson, tune: "Female Drummer" from Steeleye Span's "Please to See The King")
45 I was born in the Hellers, and when I was sixteen, oh,
46 I ran away to Thendara, and a Guardsman I became.
47 Chorus:	In the colors of the Hasturs, the silver and the blue,
48 	I stood among the Guardsmen as I'd always longed to do,
49 	With my gentle waist so slender, and my fingers long and small,
50 	I served them as a Guardsman the best of them all.
51 And serving with the Guardsmen, such sights as I did see,
52 For the Hasturs dealt with Terrans and I served them faithfully,
53 And buckling on my longsword, I'd often cause to smile,
54 To think I'd served beside the men, and a maiden all the while.
55 CHORUS
56 But they never found my secret out until a day ago,
57 When my troop was made an honor guard and to the court did go,
58 There I met with a _leronis_ and she knew I was a maid,
59 She went to my commander and so I was betrayed.
60 CHORUS
61 I went before Lord Hastur, and told him it was true,
62 It's a shame, he said, to lose a valiant Guardswoman like you,
63 So I sought the _Comhi-Letzii_, and they gladly took me in,
64 And when my oath is given, I shall serve my lord again.
65 Chorus:	In the colors of the Hasturs, the silver and the blue,
66 	I shall stand among the Guardsmen as I've always longed to do,
67 	With my gentle waist so slender, and my fingers long and small,
68 	I shall serve them as a Guardswoman the best of them all.

73 Ah yes...It is so good to see the return of Bard. Mayhaps his songs of fantasy and joy can bring a smile to the now
74 frowning faces of so many users of Backwater. 
75 Mikey : I enjoyed your message on intelligence. An age old argument indeed. What is intelligence? Can it be measured?
76 What is the use of measuring IQ? There are so many kinds of "intelligence", it would take a lifetime to measure all
77 of them properly. Maybe that is the closest thing we have to a true measure of intelligence. What did a person achieve
78 during his or her lifetime? The life experience is the only meter I can see into what people are capable of. Even then,
79 fate has a way of slapping you in the face, regardless of your intelligence. Who knows how many geniuses have never 
80 been given the chance to express their intelligence. How many greats have been wasted? How many things have gone
81 undiscovered due to fate, society, cruelty, bigotry, meaness, jealousy, hatred, and all the other human frailties
82 we are all capable of. Even the life experience can't be a true test. What really is the use of all this measuring
83 anyway? Is it another form of the incessant catagorizing we constantly do? I say we need to put less emphasis on IQ.
84 Why burden people with the knowledge that they may not be as smart as others, according to some test that they take.
85 Let them be happy with what and who they are. Let them try to make the best of what they have. I am sure we can all
86 do without the worry that we may not be as smart as the next guy. Those who are at peace with themselves are the ones
87 who are playing it smart. More power to them!

96    The piper smiled listening to the bard's songs.  Sitting back in his chair
97 he called "Bravo, my friend, bravo!"  Draining the last of his drink, he stood
98 up and placed the pipes on his shoulder.  Fanning out the three drones, the 
99 piper gently grasped the chanter and inflated the bag.  Thumping the bag gently,
100 he set the drones humming, then increased the pressure to cause the chanter to
101 send out its eerie wail.  His fingers flew over the holes in the feather-light
102 wooden chanter and coaxed out a sprightly tune with ominous overtones -- his 
103 foot tapped quickly and his ears listened to the tune of 'Munloch Bridge.' 
104 When the tune was finished, he quickly started one called 'The Rowan Tree', 
105 then finished the set with 'Queen Victoria's Jubilee.'
106 pppppppppppppppppppppppp
107   To add my remarks to the discussion on intellegence --
108 I believe that intellegence is not a single, testable, observable attribute of
109 an organism or person.  It is a constellation of attributes or abilities that
110 some folks feel should be testable.  We can catagorize many attributes of this
111 constellation, but can only test for those traits that we have recognized and
112 constructed tests to measure.  In addition, all tests measure one attribute that
113 the test designers are probably aware of but ignore thru a tacit consensus --
114 all tests measure, in addition to the subject of the test, the person's skill at
115 taking tests.  When I was younger and in better form, I used to boast that I 
116 could get at least a score of 75% on any multiple-choice test that someone
117 would name.  I failed this self-imposed test twice out of approximately 15
118 trys -- in subjects I knew nothing about.  However, in doing so I did pick up
119 some portions of the subject matter on which I was being tested ....
120 I maintain that I was exhibiting skill in the art of test-taking, and a limited
121 amount of intellegence.  (It was not too intellegent to go to that much trouble
122 for mere ego gratification!)  Obviously "street smarts" are a set of skills that
123 are related to intellegence, as are woodcraft skills, ability to breed and grow
124 beautiful flowers, fix an ailing engine, butcher a steer, deliver a baby, and 
125 keep your house payments or rent current during a recession.  How about the
126 ability to resist or see through the blandishments of the salesmen on a used
127 car lot?  These and more take what we call intellegence -- something that will
128 never be truly measurable because it includes potential -- potential that by
129 the fact of being measured becomes overt.

144 So, what is new?  Not much and who CARES!   This is getting really boring
145 with the same old junk.  Why do I logon?  There is nothing else to do with
146 this computer.  It's still better than playing games that still suck.  
147 programming is no good, I have already done whatever you could do and it's 
148 like running into a brick wall over and over.  This could be fun but everyone
149 just talks about computer related topics and it's boring.  I can't even
150 think of anything other than computer junk.  My mind is OATMEAL.  It's
151 getting better on the boards but it's still a long ways from fun.

         She came running before troubled winds, 
164           Seeking shelter in a squalid port. 
165            Her prow awash, her sails in tatters,
166 
         The fires in her galley drowned by the sea.
167           A gapping hole struck to her very heart
168            Caused by an unexpected hidden reef. 
169 
         Her main mast lay shattered on the deck,
170           Her mainsail lost to the tortured wind.
171            A makeshift rudder made from the decking
172 
         Replaced one long since lost to guide her.
173           Awe and sorrow filled the port at this
174            Seldom had such damage been witnessed.
175 
         And yet still she survived and fought.
176           Nosing into the dock, she shuddered 
177            To a stop her ordeal at an end at last.
178 
         Many months were spent in the repairs.
179           Slowly and with great pain was the
180            Damage repaired to her structure.
181 
         But the scars to her soul would remain
182           Forever a part of her life and being.
183            In time they would meld into the whole,
184 
         But for now they were raw and hurt.
185           A long period of time was she at port,
186            We had come to accept her as our own.
187 
         In time her hull was made whole, her 
188           Masts restored, and new sails were
189            furled on her arms, her fires restored. 
190 
         Her beauty adding color and life to our
191           Ragged and dilapidated time worn docks.
192            In our selfish pride did we forget
193 
         That someday she must leave once she was
194           Whole and able to brave the open sea.
195            Then one day it finaly did happen,
196 
         I found she had gone in the middle of
197           The night, a barren gap in the docks,
198            Leaving a gapping hole in my own heart. 
199 
         Will she ever return to the docks again,
200           To once more brighten the lifeless port?
201            That she would call my port home again.

243 ALAN PARSONS PROJECT PUTS OUT SOME OF THE FINEST MUSIC
244 I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN WHAT SOME OTHER PEOPLE'S TASTES  LEAN TOWARD.
245 Leonard: Thanks, I'll try it, I'm using color-com E which has a "send one

248 M.M. (et al) - I do not feel that intelligence can be measured absolutely
249                by anyone other than oneself.  To quote from 'Desiderata'
250                (Which was actually written in the mid sixties) 'Do not
251                compare yourself with others for you will become both vain
252                and bitter, for there will always be greater and lesser
253                persons than yourself.  It is not others that I compare 
254                myself to, but the individual I was yesterday.  Did I stand 
255                up for what I believed?  Did I harm someone else by my lack
256                of action or my action?  Is there some way I could improve 
257                the outlook I have on life that I have not yet tried?  That
258                is my measure of intelligence.  I am sure that I could beat
259                some of you in I.Q. tests, and get soundly trounced by others
260                of you.  Yet I have more knowledge of what I do not know than
261                I had yesterday.  And each day I find new questions to ask.
262                That is important to me, for I feel it is not the person who
263                has 'all the answers' that wields the power, but the person
264                who can ask the correct questions.
265 
266 All - Speaking of standing up for that in which I believe, I would like to
267       announce the following:
268                                   503-224-xxxx

284 Laz. Well written, certainly admirable qualities, moral goals for some of 
285 us whose tolerance quotient is < others, however "IQ" means simply the c
286 capacity to learn, not what anyone HAS learned. "IQ" has become a generic 
287 phrase which is intended to ask 'how much do you know about whatever'. What
288 is your Jello, Kleenex, sports, Librium at Fred Meyer's pharmacy for 22% less
289 sexual awareness of your partner, trivia IQ?" Safeway once distributed a 
290 bullein to all their produce department employees asking them to complete 
291 it, and return it to the store manager. The results were tabulated to deter-
292 mine the "Fruit IQ"! (Ten extra points if you know what a Kiwi fruit is, and
293 a bonus of 5 more if you know where Kiwi fruit comes from. "IQ?" It is a known
294 quantity that black people score lower on "IQ" tests than white people. Some
295 jerk psychologist 'proved' that a few years ago in a series of tests at UCLA.
296 What he failed to consider was that the administered tests were for the life
297 style of white people. I would dearly love to see a "IQ" test written by 
298 black people, and administered to a group of white psychologists! I'd like 
299 to see their "relative" scores!
300 "IQ": I know literal genuises who are scared shitless of slum areas at night,
301 but at the dinner table, have all the answers to the 'ghetto problems'."IQ":
302 The application of ones abilities, and the resultant contentment factor (on
303 a 'me generation' scale) are what(in my opinion) count. In other words, "IQ"
304 has little to do with contentment. It is adjustment to ones lifestyle, and
305 happiness therewith that really counts. If you have ever been exposed to the
306 lifestyle of 'retarded' people, you would have observed that they are omong
307 the most well adjusted, happy people there are.

327 Well it seems that the Mobius strip is back at the start again. The 
328 arguments have come back to intelligence VS stored knowledge. The Library
329 of Congress has all the information you would need to pass any test of
330 IQ ect. Access is truly different. Some have (rightly so) stated the most
331 (all?) the tests for IQ are subjective based on the population that the 
332 tests are given to. So Some have also stated that the tests can be a learning
333 situation. Others have stated basically the same thing in 'street sense' ect.
334 The only conclusion that I can see is that the basis for a discussion of

345 U.Q. - They say that every discussion needs an unknown quantity. It's good to
346    see you join this one. Incidentally, have you noticed how many people here
347    have the first name 'unknown'? Maybe in this reality it's the generic name
348    of choice. You raise some excellent points. Your comments about intelligence
349    and testing reminded me of a story. This friend of mine has a beautiful
350    parrot, that for some reason, hardly ever makes a sound. People who visit
351    are always trying to talk to the parrot and inevitably comment on the 
352    parrot's silence. The friend is usually heard to mumble something like,
353    'People sure place a lot of value on a talking parrot, do they ever stop
354    and consider the value of a thinking parrot?'.
355         
356 All the excellent comments here concerning intelligence and intelligence
357 detectors has covered the subject thoroughly.

361 Laissez-faire - (see above)+ It would appear that you agree concerning the
362    subject of the formulation of questions. It does seem that a good question
363    always seems to produce a good answer. As a friend of mine sometimes says,
364    'and all we got to go on is how things seem!'.                 
365    My profession seems to vary from time to time. Having acquired skills in
366    various areas, I use the ones that seem appropriate at the time. This
367    sometimes takes the form of skipper for hire. (mostly boat deliveries,     
368    with a strong preference for sail) At other times it has been playing
369    music and shuckin' around. (nearly starved) On occasion, such as lately,
370    applying some mathematical skills to the art of software writing. There
371    are others but I'll skip the boring details. So, take your pick. When I 
372    was a kid people were always asking, "What are you going to be when you
373    grow up?". Finding that having no answer was unacceptable, I devised a
374    list of quick answers. I would use the one that seemed most appropriate.
375    Now people just ask, "when are you going to grow up?" and I can only
376    smile.

483 Mig: I couldn't help notice your entry on the 68020, and your comparison
484 to the VAX. Benchmarks can be so misleading, especially when they are
485 published by the manufacturer of one of the components. After reading at
486 great length the report put out by Motorolla, and the report put out by
487 Intel (80286), and the report put out by National Semiconductor (NS16032 and
488 family), I can only come to the conclusion that each of these reports
489 are terribly slanted in the direction that their respective cpu excells
490 at. And with the general acceptance of VAX being by far the leading
491 supermini, what better target can there be for companies clamoring for a
492 portion of that very lucrative market? It is advisable to be careful
493 when speaking about such results. There are so many variables: bandwidth,
494 clock rate, access time, amount of cache, type of programming etc
495 that the benchmarks each of these comapanies claim to be conclusive
496 evidense of the superiority of their product, are quite the opposite. Until
497 an indepenant organization builds equivalant computers to do real
498 benchmarking, I am afraid we are all at the mercy of the marketing dept.
499 of each of these fine companies.

507 that many companies employ ghost writers that submit 'unbiased' evaluations

545 Prometheus - sorry about the delay, I've been busy destroying a rather
546 boastful Trivial Pursuit player 6 - Zip.  (you know what it's like to be
547 humbled, so I won't reveal his name <here>.  Maybe CBBS/PCS in a private msg?
548 Or maybe not).
549 The only characters that cause any problems for me are ^R (18d), ^Q (17d), ^E (5d),
550 ^T (20d) and ESC (27d).  ^R opens input to buffer, ^Q dumps my buffer,
551 ^E sends my identity, ^T stops input to buffer [a nuisance if I'm trying to
552 download], and ESC does all sorts of dreadful things depending on what follows it.
553 Oh yeah, 31d clears my screen.  How about Zeros?  That's a nice, innocuous character.
554 By the way, I appreciate your concern.
555 When are you going to get your lower case functioning properly?  It really helps readability.
556 (and it improves it's subconscious acceptance).
557 Leonard - I've got a good reel-to-reel, but only a middling cassette.
558 If you could supply a decent cassette deck, I could do the copying.
559 L'homme - Thursday is PAUG, isn't it.  Judging by the last two meetings I've been
560 to, I think I'll pass. I will, however, go to the PCS meeting.
561 Leonard again - I've got most of the CSN albums, would that make it any easier?
562 To the person trying to upload - (a modification to what Leonard said about prompts)-
563 If your terminal program is waiting for a prompt at each line, set it up to
564 wait for BELL (7d).  Then, while it is waiting, hit the backspace.  This causes
565 Backwater to send a bell, but doesn't embed anything in the disk.
566 It works quite well for me.

569 L'homme:I too was sceptic, but having all of the material from
570 all`3 bio manufactures(go for it speel alert!) I come to the`conclusion that
571 the 68020 is by far`the fastest. The 32032 from national is the easyist to 
572 use and Intel is full of trash. The advertisements from Intel are wonders of slanted
573 writing. The 80286 is slow, runs hot (has been known to melt chip sockets)
574 and has no support. National has the compleat set out and avalible for you and me
575 to buy.`I have used the 16032 and the motorola 68020 and find thav the 68020 is far
576 faster. However it has no floating point`yet. All things considered I would`use the national 
577 chip set if I needed a fast system right now, the motorola in about 8 months.
578 If your looking for a fast system chip set and have the drives around to do`it with the 68020 is indeed faster
579 then the VAX as shown by`my own tests and those of motorola.
580 Prometheus:In my box labled "major silicon" When do you need it? I am going to be downtown tuesday if you want`to arrange some
581 thing. I may just drop by MLC`hsnicker)

586 without any problems. True, I can only send one line at a time
587 but it works, and takes up a lot less on line time than not uploading.
588 Perhaps if I were to type in the ASCII code for return at the end
589 of each line, I could upload the whole message. The Color Com E has
590 variable time delay between characters. Perhaps if I
591 slow it down, BW will accept more than one line at a time. Can
592 anyone advise me on this? 
593 This was written before I read the last hundred or so lines. 
594 I lost the first line of the above upload. 
595 I am not using disc, but am typing in advance to the transmit buffer
596 to upload. Does that make any difference?
