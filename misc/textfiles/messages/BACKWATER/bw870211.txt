60 L'homme: one minor problem... I need to be able to switch between (among?)
61 5 printers hooked up to *at least* three computers/terminals. I'd rather
62 not have to do my 'reconfigurations' by cable swapping. "Smart" switches
63 are probably out too, as I'm not going to trust them to be able to tell
64 their commands from the graphics data on the way to the printer.
65 	Any suggestions?
66 	By the way, I've 'found' my problem with formatting on the AT. All
67 I have to do is reduce the number of buffers in CONFIG.SYS to 37 and I can
68 format regular disks. At 32 buffers I *still* can't format HC disks (except
69 from a batch file run from a menu shell?!?!).
70 	Any idea as to what is going on?

81 
82 Umm...You wanted to speak to me, sir?
83 
84 
85 THAT'S RIGHT, GABRIEL.  IT'S ABOUT LAST NIGHT.  YOU WERE PRETENDING YOU WERE 
86 ME AGAIN, WEREN'T YOU?
87 
88 Well...(gulp)...yes sir.  You see, Peter and I were hitting the nectar pretty
89 hard, and-
90 
91 PETER TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT.  I HAD TO DISCIPLINE HIM FOR THE NUN THING.
92 
93 Nun thing?
94 
95 YEAH.  HE WAS TEASING SOME NUNS AT THE GATE LAST NIGHT.  TOLD THEM THEY 
96 COULDN'T COME IN BECAUSE THEY'D DEVELOPED SOME BAD HABITS.
97 
98 Ooh.
99 
100 I THOUGHT SO TOO.  I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MOSES FOR SCRATCHING OFF THE ELEVENTH
101 COMMANDMENT -- THE ONE FORBIDDING BAD PUNS.  I SHOULD HAVE MADE IT NUMBER SIX
102 OR SOMETHING, THEN SOMEONE WOULD HAVE ASKED ME WHY THEY JUMPED FROM FIVE TO
103 SEVEN, AND I WOULD HAVE NOTICED THE PROBLEM SOONER.  BUT I DIGRESS.  WE WERE
104 TALKING ABOUT YOU.  YOU'VE CREATED QUITE A PROBLEM FOR ME, GABE.
105 
106 I didn't think it was all that serious, sir.
107 
108 OH REALLY?  WELL WHAT DO YOU WILL HAPPEN WHEN ORAL ROBERTS MOUTHS OFF THAT I'M
109 GOING TO KILL HIM?
110 
111 Uhh...
112 
113 NOW SOMEONE'S GOT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING-
114 
115 Maybe he'll raise the money, and we won't have to worry about it!
116 
117 NO WAY.  NO ONE WILL GIVE HIM MONEY.  I GAVE THE EARTHLINGS BRAINS A WHILE
118 BACK, REMEMBER?
119 
120 I'm afraid I hadn't heard about that, sir.
121 
122 YOU DON'T READ THE BULLETIN BOARD, DO YOU GABRIEL?
123 
124 Well...
125 
126 BY THE WAY.  YOU KNOW THAT I EXIST EVERYWHERE AT ALL TIMES.  HOW DID YOU THINK
127 YOU COULD GET AWAY WITH THIS?
128 
129 Well ... uh ... I kinda thought that if I made myself ... look like you ...
130 then you'd see you were already there, and ... you ... wouldn't ... umm ... 
131 bother checking up.  (Pause)  It all made more sense last night, the nectar and
132 all ...
133 
134 UH-HUH.  WELL WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE WE DO ABOUT THIS?  I CAN'T KILL HIM, OR
135 EVERYONE WILL THINK HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT ALL THAT OTHER STUFF HE'S BEEN SAYING.
136 IF I LET HIM LIVE, SOME GOOD PEOPLE MIGHT DOUBT THAT I EXIST.
137 
138 Maybe we could make him have a stroke or something.  Paralyze him or put him
139 in a coma!
140 
141 ARE YOU KIDDING?  IF ROBERTS SO MUCH AS STUBS HIS TOE, HE'LL BE CANONIZED.
142 YOU KNOW HOW HISTORIANS EXAGGERATE.  DON'T YOU REMEMBER THE LOCUST THING?
143 
144 I think so. You sent a plague of locusts on Egypt so the Pharaoh would-
145 
146 NO! THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN.  I PUT HALF A GRASSHOPPER IN THE PHARAOH'S
147 SANDWICH, HE FREAKED OUT, WORD GOT OUT, AND BY THE TIME SOMEONE WROTE IT DOWN,
148 IT WAS A FULL-BLOWN PLAGUE.  SHEESH.
149 
150 Sorry, sir.  Hey! I got it ... we could make him go insane, and everyone will
151 think he was having a delusion!
152 
153 DO YOU REALLY THINK ANYONE WOULD NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE?
154 
155 We could prove it!  We could make him take one of those Rorschach tests, with
156 all those pictures of naked women!
157 
158 UMM ... GABRIEL, THE INK BLOTS ARE MEANINGLESS BLOBS THAT THE SUBJECT
159 INTERPRETS BASED ON HIS PERSONALITY AND INNERMOST THOUGHTS.
160 
161 Oh ... oops.
162 
163 WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO-
164 
165 Actually, I never really thought much of human psychology, you know.
166 
167 RIGHT.  AS I WAS SAYING, I THINK WE SHOULD-
168 
169 To tell you the truth, I never even SAW the pictures -- I just heard Peter 
170 talking about them.  Yeah, that's it!  Peter was talking about them!
171 
172 ARE YOU QUITE THROUGH, GABRIEL?
173 
174 Yes sir.
175 
176 GOOD.  AS I WAS SAYING, IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO-
177 
178 Hey!  Did it sound like I said "naked women"?  I just realized it could have
179 sounded like that!  Isn't that funny?  What I really said was "snakes-a-
180 swimmin".  You know, like those snakes that can ... swim ... in ... ... the ...
181 (an even longer pause) ... Is everything OK, sir?  You look a little ... I
182 dunno, it's kind of hard to describe-
183 
184 AAAAAAARRRRRRRGH!!!
185 
186 I'm sorry, sir.  Was I interrupting you?

192 
193        NOTE:  It was reported in subsequent sections of the publication cited
194 above that Oral Roberts failed to raise the required funds by the stated dead-
195 line.  On that fateful day, Roberts did, in fact, stub his toe.  Staunch 
196 supporters of the television evangelist maintain that Jesus' message of 
197 impending "death" was actually a symbolic warning of what they now call the
198 "Holy Stubbing."  They acknowledge, however, that the realization of this fact
199 would have been much more impressive had it occurred prior to the blessed
200 event.  Two thousand years later, Roberts was canonized.

205 DISCLAIMER:  As the author of the preceding passage, I must point out the 
206 fictitious nature of the events described therein.  Although it is entirely
207 possible that the Oral Roberts incident occurred as stated, it is only one 
208 reasonable scenario.  I realize that the shocking realism and depth of 
209 character development could have caused some confusion on that point.  I repeat
210 that I am privy to NO special information; devout christians are encouraged not
211 to convert to Buddhism based solely on the nature of the passage.  In fact,
212 any resemblance the characters may bear to existing or mythical, natural or
213 supernatural beings is purely coincidental, and, of course, unintentional.

261 Good Show!

263 It was several hours later before I was truly rational once more.
264 I blamed my dilemma on bad luck, positive entropy, and Friday the thirteenth;
265 most of those spent hours consisted of ranting about each of these in turn and
266 in groups.
267 Yob tried to understand how I felt, but I doubt if he came close.  I felt
268 severely crippled.  Magic was not possible here!
269 And yet there was no technology, either.
270 That got me to thinking.
271 The multiverse, I had found after several decades spent exploring a very small
272 piece of it, tended to follow a few simple rules.  One of the most consistent
273 of these was the Science/Magic summation.
274 S + M = K.  A universe where magic was common held low technology, and vice
275 versa.  Oh, there were exceptions.  Not many.
276 The world All appeared to be a world null.  K factor of near zero.
277 It appeared magic was not possible.  Science was also unknown.  What was left?
278 What indeed?
279 The sun of All sank slowly in the sky, shedding tinted luminance upon me.
280 Long moments passed before the upper rim of its shining globe was the last
281 light peeping over the mountains of All.
282 Then was sunset.  The earth seemed to shake just slightly, only for a moment-
283 The universe held its breath during that instant.  As did I.
284 And suddenly I knew where All had hidden its magic.

362                    --------------------
363 
364      The cold stoneness of the corpse against his cheek pulled him to
365 wakefulness; awake, yet not fully alert.
366      A faint clicking scattered through mind, making careful and regular,
367 gradually forming the beats of a clock.  All was silent without, save for
368 the faint, second-hand clicks.  He dressed himself up, looking out the
369 window to see the cool frost glittering on frozen brittle blades of grass,
370 their gentle stalks housed in an icy-sheen cage of transparency.
371      "Let's get moving," shouted a voice from a dark passageway in the
372 floor.  slowly, he edged to his belongings, picking them up one by one. 
373 The last, deadly weapon though it was, must come as well.  He admired it
374 for the deadly power he had when he clutched it, yet was revulsed by it for
375 the same.  A wanderer's life amongst hostile land invites enemies, and
376 there was only a single response those enemies understood... violence.
377 The sword was necessary.
378      He shifted his belongings to accomodate the little headroom in the
379 floor passage.  With a quick glance around he ducked into the passage and
380 stumbled headlong into the darkness off-balance.  Slowly adjusting eyes
381 gave him faint traces of movement, then forms.  His ankle buckled on the
382 stairs and forms disappeared from vision as he tumbled down into
383 resignation, the sword sticking from his side, pommel out, blade in.  His
384 blood ran.  And he dreamed of lost mirrored reflections in the shadow of
385 death brought by a necessary sword.

403  Hey,
404       Did anyone see Saturday night live? AMERIDA. Could it happen? 
405 I have some other questions too. Why do these tv executive dudes put dumb
406 stuff on tv? AMERIKA, The Two Mrs. Grinwalds, ect. I personally would like to
407 see more of Disney's stuff. Sure some of it's for little kids, but some can
408 be pretty cool. And maybe instead of paying 40 million to make stupid, and
409 overall boring shows like AMERIKA they should get some newer movies like 
410 Beverly Hills Cop would be a improvment. Not super new movies but ones that
411 are'nt 7 years old and everyone has seen 20 times.

445 Mikey: Sure Amerika is boring now, but what if it had starred Chuck Norris or
446 Sly Stallone? It would have been full of bombs and machine guns and explosions,
447 as a small group of outlaw GI Joes keep the rotten Rusky amry at bay, ala
448 Red Dawn. I think the makers of this film wanted to present 'What I think is
449 wrong with our country' with a 14.5 hour movie. You don't demonstrate such a
450 grandiose thought with M16's, you do it with talk, and more talk, and still
451 more talk, unless you are Kris Kristofferson; then you just state at people
452 and mutter a word or two.
453 
454 What bothered me from the beginning about this movie, is how the situation
455 depicted could ever come to pass. America is (I believe) the fourth largest
456 country land mass on the earth. It has the third largest standing army, and
457 the second (or first depending on who you listen to) largest nuclear
458 arsenal. It has the largest weapons manufacturing capability of any country
459 on earth. So how did we lose the war? Did the Ruskies walk in and take over?
460 I don't fall for this apathetic BS. Nationalism is at a high right now, and
461 I fail to see how in 1987 the US could be taken so easily. I find it difficult
462 to base a 14.5 hour show on the premise that the Russians could walk in and
463 take the country relatively unscathed. Perhaps we will see differently in
464 the upcoming hours.
465 
466 My predictions for upcoming events in Amerika:
467 
468 Mariel Hemingway, in her most stunning role since Star 80, will knife Sam
469 Neill in the back when he least expects it... Think about it.
470 Wendy Hughes will get hers when Kris catches up to her and makes her sorry
471 she ever turned him in. Meanwhile, their older son will takes Dad's side and
472 become a leading freedom fighter.
473 Cindy Pickett, sick of Robert Urich's rise to power in the name of helping his
474 country, will split with their daughter and hide out with Krisofferson.
475 
476 One thing I thought very funny about the first episode: Apparently the Russians
477 have used their touch of gold on the midwest farm land by dividing it up into
478 a bunch of tiny plots, they have turned the most productive land in terms of
479 bushel/acre in the world into dust. But this time there is no US to buy wheat
480 from.

488 bit of fictional relief:
489 
490 --  Tam held the spoon with such a rigid grasp the her fingers lost the
491 color of healthy flesh and became pale white. Her eyes were the same color
492 as the liquid medication that poured down into the spoon. When her shaking
493 started again, she jabbed the metal spoon into her mouth, glancing off her
494 teeth once. You see, she played one of the instruments in a string
495 quartet. But she also was insane and under medication to keep her
496 reasonable. The medication kept her from playing well however. Knowing it,
497 she kept herself on dosages far under what was needed to keep her sane.
498 Only now, she was losing it so fast if she didn't take the medicine, she'd
499 lose it all.  --

502 L'homme: While I missed part of the first episode, I got the impression
503 that the SU used EMP to knock out communications. (yes, I know there are
504 problems with this).
505 	As for the size of our armed forces, please check the figures for 
506 *combat* troops and for percentage of units combat ready, and percentage
507 at full strength. (As an example, US Navy missile frigates have to 
508 rendevous with their reliefs and transfer the missiles as there aren't
509 enough to go around).
510 	As has been noted in the media, we do not have enough supplies
511 (especially ammunition) to fight a war for more than a few days. Our
512 *only* choices are surrender, or "push the button". Care to make any bets
513 as to what a Democratic president might do given that choice? Especially,
514 since (from what we've seen so far) the terms were quite generous. If you
515 don't think they were generous, try picturing us under the same kind of
516 control as the SU uses in Eastern Europe.

528 Regarding Amerika:  I have not watched it a, and I have no intention of 
529 wathching it, but from what I have heard, it is wildly inaccurate, especially
530 in its portrayal of the Russian people.  I have spoken with people about 
531 Russian history, and they may have every right to be as paranoid as they 
532 seem to be.  During the course of their history, they have been invaded 
533 several times, tyrannized and basically stepped upon.  This even shows in
534 parts of their language.  One episode of their history involved the Tartars
535  who would ride to a town and demand tribute.  If it was not paid, they 
536 killed every man, woman, and child, rode to the next town ( with smoke still
537 on the horizon ) and demanded tribute. VEEEEERRRRRY effective.  And you
538 wonder why they aren't willing to negotiate and improve relations?  The
539 president has missiles situated all around the Soviet-bloc countries, and 
540 he wonders why they aren't willing to negotiate?

542 P.XS.  The Russian word for money comes out of the period of history I mentione
543 d.  Russian is my major, and sometimes it gives an expanded view of things
544 beyond the nationalism that most people exhibit. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

564 ****************************************************************************
565 L'homme: How can it be anything *but* better from where it started.
566 Yes, the way the thing was written requires gobs and gobs of talk too
567 set things up. Then about once a night they can lead up to a "powerfully
568 emotional" scene that doesn't need any words to make it understood. Of
569 *course* it doesn't need any words, they provided them all night long.
570 There were many many scenes that I felt were of little use and didn't
571 need to be there. Most of the stuff I saw could have been tightened up
572 by at least a factor of 3 or 4. This thing makes Gandi look like a 
573 (up)Chuck Noris film. I have been watching most of it, but I do confess
574 that I have been switching channels when it gets so blasted boring that
575 I can't take it anymore. I'm not after shoot 'em up stuff, I'd just like
576 to see some movement, and a relief from the tedious repitition of the
577 same plot line over and over and over and over and over and over and ov....
578 In regard to Russia's past problems definning their current mind set,
579 I agree to some extent, but not entirely. There have been *many* societies
580 that have endured such problems and they survived. No tow societies go in
581 the same direction. Americans have a problem of expecting the world to
582 think and operate the way they do. And when the world goes on its way
583 and ignores America we get all upset and *demand* that they follow our
584 path. Every society has its own values and ideals. Ours is not the 
585 only way, nor is it the best way for everyone.

592 Mikey:  This is very true.... I really wasn't thinking clearly, just blindly 
593 striking out against ofall of the anti-Soviet dreck everywhere.  I think that 
594 perhaps the U.S. could get along a great deal better with the Soviet Union.
595 It is also very true that the Americans think that everybody thinks and acts 
596 in the same way they do.  The Soviets are used to their system, and we are used to ours.  I doubt that we could ever completely
597 understand each others' viewpoint, because of cultural, social, and ideological
598 differences, but relations could possibly improve greatly if we took the time
599 to take into account these differences in those areas.
