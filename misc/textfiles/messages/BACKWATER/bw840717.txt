64 Ever hear the old saying : "If you don't have anything good to say then
65                              don't say anything at all."

69   " Welcome to Archadia, Captain Griff. "
70    " I'm dead...I was dying ", he said.
71    " You are not dead.  We salvaged your ship and your life.  Now 
72 you are here."
73    It was a pretty young voice, which soothed Griff's nerves.  He 
74 opened  his eyes,  and gazed apon a pretty youth face which  well
75 matched the voice.
76    " You are in the village life center, Captain Griff.  It was a
77 close call,  but you are safe now,  and you will be able to leave 
78 soon ", she said.
79    " The planet? "
80  " No,  I'm afraid that your ship was destroyed ",  she paused, 
81 " My name is Kewelli, and I will be your host." 
82    " My what?"
83   " Rest now Captain.  I'll come for you soon."
84                            *    *    *
85    Time passed quickly, and Griff was back to his old self in the 
86 week.  He had speant all his time with Kewelli, as she showed him
87 the planet.  They now looked over a vast uninhabited valley.
88  "  We  have  conquered all disease and pain.   We  are  slowly 
89 reclaiming  the areas of land destroyed by war and  neglect.   We 
90 have a simple life - we think and enjoy our time.
91    Griff was not paying attention to the sermon,  because he  was 
92 enthralled by the landscape.  She continued :
93    "  We need not do any work,  because the labor units do it all 
94 for us."
95    Griff looked up, and for the first time noticed the human like 
96 
form of a worker android in the distance.
97    " No work ? ", he asked.
98  None.   We consider them to be greatest creation.   They can 
99 do  anything a normal man could do.   They can even mimick  man's 
100 behavior to the smallest detail, if necessary.  Impressive ? "
101    " Yes, very..", he replied without thinking.
102    " Come, we have people to meet. "
103                            *    *    *
104    As  they  walked back to the village,  Griff  condsidered  how 
105 attached he had become to Kewelli in such a short time.  They got
106 along so well.  It was as if she was made for him.
107 
108    " Stop thinking aimlessly.  You must prepare yourself for your 
109 meeting with the elders.   They wish to learn something from you, 
110 which is an honor. "
111    " And what's that ? ", he asked.
112  " You will find out. "
113    They  came to the front of a hut located in the center of  the 
114 village.
115   " You must go in alone.  I shall soon join you ", she said.
116 Griff  stepped inti the room,  finding it too dark to see.   As 
117 his  eyes  adjusted,  he felt his arms grabed,  and he  was  held 
118 firmly in place.  An old man stepped foward.
119   " We are the elders.  You know something we must learn."
120   " But you will,  you will.   Kewelli has been give poison which 
121 she  will take if you do not agree to tell us want we must  know.
122 You must tell them how to kill.  To kill..."
123   Griff felt anger building in his body.  " Sweet inocent Kewelli
124 shall  not  die ",  he thought.   He burst from the  grips of  the
125 androids and sprang towards the elder with a scream.
126  " You play into my hands. "
127   Griff used all of his strength to punch the old man across  the 
128 jaw.   As  his  hand hit,  he heard and felt the cracking of  the
129 bones in his hand.   The elder, who seemed not to even notice the 
130 blow,  walked  foward to one of the droids who had  been  holding
131 Griff.   With  no  expresion,  the  old man dealt a  punch  which 
132 shattered the jaw and ripped the skin of the droid.  It collapsed
133 in a lifeless heap.
134   Griff  watched in horror as blood poured from the creature  and 
135 dripped to the floor.
136                          *    *    *
137   Well, so much for the pitfalls of file transfer...

139 Aaron:
140      My departure was a combination of Backwater burnout and turning my
141 energies elsewhere.  I've been trying to write some short stories for
142 publication.  So far, I collected several impressive rejection slips.
143 Salazar is even the main character in a couple of the stories.  Somehow,
144 he lacks the fire and vigor he had here.  Maybe I'll have to stick around
145 for a while to get some inspiration.  The Backwater seems to have changed
146 and yet remained the same.  It's nice to be back.  Now if I can only figure
147 out where Leroy has gotten to; maybe we can cut a deal.
148                                               Mohammed Wassir
149                                           <The Friendly Albanian>
150 P.S.  Is this 'Petrov' the same transvestite  KGB agent that lurked around
151 the Inn sometime ago, or somebody new?
152 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
153 !~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~
154 Leroy, Darling;
155      Has all that has gone between us come to naught?  I miss you terribly.
156 Call me when you can.  Wassir is in the market for some tactical nukes.
157 I think he has another one of his hair-brained schemes.
158                                               With all my love,
159                                               Serena

163      WOAH!! whats this now?
164    You never know what to expect here in the Inn.  It has run all the
165    way from Juvie Hunts, Short Stories, and now even love notes on a
166    totaly public domain.  She has alot of guts or was very intoxicated
167    at the time, but that is ruled down by her typing.  
168      Thats what makes ths Inn such aLeader.  More systems should
169    follow the Inns lead, this town might be one of the highest when it
170    comes to boards.
171      To thone who wishes to remain nameless, WHY? You put yourself
172    in the spot light now.  If you wanted attention, that was not the way
173    to go about it.  Trybeing nice instead of the insulting garbage that
174    you put up.  Here is another question for you, do you really think
175    that the person you offended is scared?  He shouldn't be.
176      There is always a time and a place for everything, I know I will try
177    to keep offensiv messages from the Inn.

182 TO BACKUP PEOPLE: TIS DONE! THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 33 DISKS AND 193 BW FILES
183 LARGEST FILE IS 45K. WARNING, SOME OF THE FILES STILL HAVE CONTROL
184 CHARACTERS IMBEDDED IN THEM I NORMALLY TRY TO STRIP THEM OFF, BUT I
185 FORGOT ON SOME. SO IF YOU TRY TO PRINT THEM OUT, IT MAY DRIVE YOUR
186 PRINTER BANNANAS. ALSO, I THINK ONE OF THE FILES HAS A CTRL Z IMBEDDED
187 IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AS WELL, SINCE CPM USES CTRL/Z AS A FILE TERMINATER,
188 THIS COULD ALSO CAUSE YOU A PROBLEM. SUGGEST YOU LOOK FOR TWO OR MORE
189 CTRL/Z'S AS A TERMINATOR INSTEAD. NOW, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE
190 OUT HOW TO DISTRIBUTE THE MESS.

192 P.S. HAS ANYONE SEEN PAM LATELY? HER LAST ENTRY INDICATED SHE WANTED
193 TO LEAVE SOMETHING HERE BUT WAS UNABLE TO DUE TO A FULL DISK, AND WOULD
194 RETURN AT A LATER TO DO SO. THAT WAS SOMETIME AGO. I HOPE NOTHING HAS
195 HAPPENED TO HER. MAYBE I JUST WORRY TOO MUCH.

198 No.... I guess that wasn't L'homme at the door.  He sure looked like him though... they could be twins.  That man 
199 next to him looks EVIL... A name comes to mind... Sundownor?  That's strange.  His emanations are not at all like 
200 those of humans.  I feel a great energy stored within him.  That one is dangerous.  "Doctor, do you see that one?"
201 "Yes, he looks a little on the nasty side, if you ask me."  "Yes, quite so.  I'm just glad he hasn't noticed us.

210 Riskers: Could someone, about once a week, leave a message giving a summary of what happens?  If not once a week, 
211 how about every other gathering?  I can't watch, but I would like to follow the game somewhat.

219 L'homme:won 1
220 Alex won the first by an extraordinary combination of sly moves. I, in the second game, nuked the hell out of him 
221 my first turn. Thus endith ALEX for the second game. L'homme won it after a brutal power struggle with an unknown

234 ALEX: Definitely enjoyed the risk games, even if you were an inconsiderate
235 host and slaughtered us the first game.  At least MiG paid you back in 
236 kind the second game.
237 The group seemed to work together rather well; everyone was quite willing
238 to offer suggestions to those of us less experienced.  I'm looking forward
239 to our next contest.
240 Mikey:  regarding d's second message a couple of disks ago, you mentioned that
241 there was a line missing.  When I was saving that file, when I got to that
242 point (around line 285), I got a DISK ERROR message.  Fortunately, I had
243 saved her entry shortly after she made it, while it was still intact.  If 
244 you want to correct the file (after all, those of us in the archive buy
245 want CORRECT copies!), the lines (surrounding) were:
246 The men drew back in surprise at this sudden transformation, and had
247 no answer immediately.  Searching their faces, she relaxed, and drew
248 ->up a rough-hewn bench.  Once more her voice thrummed out in earnestness:<-
249 "I await your defense, gentlemen!" and a slight smile tickled her mouth.

255   Don't get them upload blues way down deep in yore Bytes! (excuse me Bard,
256                              please! I lost my bearings there for a moment)
257 To the aspiring UPLOADERS: Only a good terminal program, with pacing during
258   uploads,  will cure the  upload blues.  If you are looking for or writing
259   such a program here's the  definitive variable parameter group.  There is
260   some combination of these  parameters that will satisfy almost any upload
261   situation you may encounter.  Now if your auto-dialer can set them up for
262   each system you call that's fancy livin'! The parameters are:
263      1) Pause between characters sent. (0-2 character times)
264      2) Pause at the end of a line. (After you send /Enter/ or /Return/)
265                 a) Wait for prompt character
266                 b) Fixed time
267                 c) Wait for keyboard prompt (& maybe +a short Pause)
268 Although I haven't seen  COPYLINK,  the messages I see would indicate it can
269 do these things.  As Cistop has said before,  on the Backwater the pause you
270 need is at the end of the line,  so the disk can find the sector to put that
271 gem of wisdom you just entered.

277    Lord Morby, Earl of Blackpool: have you called cbbs lately? if not 
278  there is a mesg. for you there. That system(cbbs) is in fact a nice one.
279    Riskers, sounds like you guys had alot of fun blowing up the world,

285 It was two hours after sunset and the the man climbing up the side of the
286 building had only reflected light from the streetlamps below to illuminate
287 his way. Carefully he reached up and placed his climbing claw in the next 
288 decorative crack in the side of the building. Only four more feet to go.
289 As he drew even with the window of the office he was interested in, he 
290 set his feet and placed the hooks of a harness he had removed from his 
291 pack. carefully settling himself in the harness he pulled out a glass cut-
292 ter and a suction clamp. Quietly affixing the clamp he cut a large hole in 
293 the window and gently set the piece of glass down inside the room. Setting
294 one last hook he moved out of the harness and into the room, drawing the
295 harness in after him. With a tube of special quick setting cement he 
296 replaced the glass in the window and sat down in a chair to await morning
297 and the arrival of the man he had come to see.

302 And a pleasure to have met you all...( in this reality )....I will attempt 
303 to avoid any hostilities resulting from the Preemptive strategys employed 
304 by those who shall remain nameless.....Ahem MiG.....I look forward to 
305 another game....L'homme did you find your missing box ?.  Below are the 
306 instructions for The Nuclear Option...
307

313  
314 RULES
315  
316      1.) Acquisition of the Nuclear Option
317 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
318           a) You may receive one (1) Nuke and two (2) armys in place
319 of the normal number of armys when you turn in cards at the begining
320 of your turn ( or when you capture another players cards  ) provided
321 one of the following conditions are meet.
322  
323                1) At least one (1) of the three cards you turn in is
324 a country that you occupy . The Nuke will be placed on one (1) of the
325 afore mentioned countrys that you occupy. In addition you get two
326 (2) Armys to strengthen your Nuclear base to be placed on the same
327 country as the Nuke.
328  
329                2) You play a Wild card , in lieu of a card whose
330 country you occupy , for Nuclear placement . You may use the  Wild
331 card to improve the security of your instalation i.e. Place it in a
332 well fortified area behind the front lines. However beware someone
333 may pull that card and Nuke your instalation .
334  
335 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
336      2) Use of the Nuclear Option
337 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
338           
339                a) Offensive Use 
340  
341      Nuclear deployment can only occur at the begining of your turn.
342 Your available targets are determined by the cards you hold. (* NOTE
343 wild cards cannot be used for target designation ) Or after you have
344 captured another players cards and turn them in for credit.
345  
346                b) Defensive Use
347  
348      A player may only use their Nuclear arms when the are being
349 attacked. The nuclear option exists as long as the player is under
350 attack. The player is under no obligation to inform anyone of
351 impending retaliation .The only target limitation being the cards the
352 player holds .( *NOTE one special case exists. i.e. It is Blacks
353 turn. Black attacks Red who launchs and destroys a country Green
354 holds. Green now has the Nuclear Option to retaliate against whatever
355 targets he has. )
356              
357                1) Defensive Launch 
358 The primary defender (Player being conventionally attacked) may
359 launch after he has beaten the attacking player in a roll of the dice
360 in lieu of the attacking player removing the armys he lost in the
361 roll. A split is sufficient.
362 *NOTE Once a Nuclear exchange has begun it can continue until the
363 last player effected cannot or chooses not to continue. ( i.e.  Green
364 launches against Red who launches against Blue who launches Yellow
365 who launches against Black who has Nuclear capability but chooses not
366 to launch. 
367  
368 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
369           Disscussion & Misc. Rules
370  
371      Targets - are determined by the cards you hold. They are played
372 by laying the chosen card face up on the board. It is then returned
373 to the card stack and shuffled back into the deck. 
374  
375      Cards - After any cards are played they are then shuffled back
376  into the deck for potential reuse by another player. 
377  
378      Dead Zones - A dead zone is established whenever a country is
379 has been target of a nuclear exchange and remains a Dead Zone for the
380 rest of the game. No player may occupy a Dead Zone however players
381 may pass through a D.Z. at a cost of 50% of their forces + 1 man .
382 The armys are removed when entering the D.Z. Armys awarded for
383 holding a continent for one turn are not awarded if that continent
384 has a D.Z.  If a country has been the site of more than one nulear
385 strike it  cannot be held or crossed for the remainder of the game .
386 In the event that it is imposible to capture all the armys a draw
387 will be declared between the remaining forces.
388  
389      Capture of a Nuke - When a nuclear base is under attack it is
390 the defenders choice to launch if he beats the attackers roll however
391 if the defender loses all the armys around the nuclear site that
392 country is overun by the attacker.  And the occupyer of the country
393 has control over the site. The only exception is that should the
394 original owner of the silo have the card for that country he may at
395 the begining of his turn detonate the nuke in its silo. 
396  
397      Re-arming existing silos -  Any player may re-arm any site that
398 currently has an existing weapon or empty silo. Providing the player
399 owns that country. Re-arming happens at the begining of each player
400 turn when he turns in cards and requests a Nuke or after the capture
401 of another players cards and turns them in.
402  
403      Army count - Every time a set of cards are turned in the count
404 of armys increases. However when the count reaches 10 armys only
405 cards turned in for Armys increase the count , cards turned in for
406 Nukes after 10 Armys are reached do not increase the count.
407  
408         I hope we can do this again in the not too distant future !

422    Ok, Lets review what happened:
423       As usual I said that
424                   1) I'd try to get to Porsfis.
425                   2) I'd at least try to make it to PC&S
426                   3) I'd try to make it to the risk game.
427           And as usual I BLEW IT!   Don't ask me why, but when my ex-boss
428 wanted me to do a job for her, I jumped.  I need the cashflow.  Hopefully
429 next time (as usual).  Well, bye for now,

465   WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PLACE I'VE SEEN MORE MESSAGES LEFT IN AN HOUR 
466   ON A CRASHED BOARD.
467 
468   All complaints aside, anybody want to start a game? I've got a great 
469   idea. 
470   1( there will be a group of time travelers.
471   2( there will be a group of warriors.
472   3( there will be (pretty monotonous huh?)agro group of senators
473 
474   OBJECT:
475  
476   Save the planet Tera from distruction.
477 
478   RULES:
479  
480   The time travelers were ordered not to change the past. But they have the
481   power to do so.
482  
483   The warriors are not mercenaries. They can act on there own unless ordered
484   otherwise.
485 
486   The senators can not order the warriors to unleash utter distruction upon
487   the planet.
488 
489   Otherwise there are none.  Have fun with it.
490 
491   Any ideas leave a message.
492 
493   Anyone interested leave a message.

509 The Doctor and I went into the kitchen, and proceeded to set up the Sonic Analyzer in the Tardis.  The sound was quite
510 clear.  "All right, let's get this straight.  This is NOT L'homme, but he looks like him?"  "That is right.  Meet 
511 the Professor, now in  disguise as L'homme sans parity.  He rigged a holo belt after he took about two day's footage
512 of the man."  "It sure works, I can't even tell the difference."  "Yes, you can - by touch.  The Professor still FEELS
513 the same, and under the holo he's carrying a Mark VII Stun-gun.  And the latest in sub machine guns.  And.... (the 
514 voice now lowers to a whisper)...Sundownor's new Sun-gun.  It's still experimental."
515 The Doctor whistled, and Milchar shook his head.  "L'homme is going to be in trouble, my friend... Shall we come to 
516 his aid?  I always did admire Earth's detectives and crime-fighters.  Particularly that James Rockford fellow.", The
517 Doctor said.  I mulled over the possibilities, and said, "This does not look good.  The look-alike Professor can get
518 REAL close to the real L'homme, and with all that hardware... Let's warn them, and then let's follow this phony L'homme
519 for a bit."  Just then, the whole group of men got up from their table, and broke up into small groups.  Each group 
520 quitely left the Dragon's Room.  Each melted into the background.
521 "After him!", cried The Doctor.
