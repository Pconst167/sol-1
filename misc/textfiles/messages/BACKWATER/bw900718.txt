 52  
 53      At the very heart of Central       City, amidst the vast demons of rock
 54 and glass that teased the feeble        light from the triad of moons, there
 55 rests a great Stone Triangle.
 56      Once, long ago, there had been     many of them... Fifty-three grand
 57 structures floating in open space over  cities great and small.  Now, only
 58 one remains.
 59      The magical aura is gone.  It      faded into dust with the fall of the
 60 Anglers.  The protective shield, too,   has fallen away, as did the coatings
 61 of primal energy that coated every      Triangle, when the Transition made the 
 62 Obscure into reality.
 63      Now, among the 349 worlds that     make up the BorderZones of Pyrrixall,
 64 only the realm of Zephyr plays host     to the silent observations of the 
 65 Triangle.  As the others spewed their   Obscure reality onto the barren surface
 66 of this once decrepit plane, the        other Triangles fell, shattering, the  
 67 brittle stone fragmenting into a        thousand million shards that were swept
 68 away into the breezes that played across new continents where once desert had  
 69 held sway.
 70      But Zephyr's barony never felt     the spasms of rebirth, his world being 
 71 the one that had Been Before...         Crushed and compacted until, where 
 72 once the mighty Medalic Prophet had     gripped all of Pyrrixall in hhis iron  
 73 hands, now he was but King of a single  city, a tiny realm amidst a vast array 
 74 of distinctly 'Other' worlds... tiny    microcosms linked side by side,
 75 connected by the Gates... shimmerinng    waterfalls of light that led to the  
 76 next landscape, the next part of the    ever-swirling patterns drifting over   
 77 the surface of Pyrrixall.
 78  
 79      Only one Triangle remains.
 80      And today, were any citizens of    Central City foolhardy enough to 
 81 venture out during Patriot's Hour,      they might have noticed something...   
 82 out of sorts.
 83  
 84      They might have heard the hissing  from the heart of The FFirst Triangle.
 85  
 86      They might have seen the dark      clouds circling overhead... The
 87 flash of lightning without thunder...   Silent bolts of light clamouring for
 88 supremacy over the peak of the aged     Triangle's grey surface.
 89  
 90      And they might have seen words,    carved from the hands of an unseen
 91 caligrapher, grinding their way into    the ancient rock...
 92  
 93      'You Shall Not Test,'
 94      'You Shall Not Test,'
 95      'Lest You Be Tested,'
 96      'You Shall Not Flee,'
 97      'The Worlds Are One.'
 98  
 99      'This Then Is the Judgement.'
100  
101      'Let Those Who Hold Worlds,'
102      'These Barons,'
103      'Medalic Prophets,'
104      'Let them Come Forth,'
105      'And The Armies of Day,'
106      'With Them...'
107  
108      'We are the Sisters Unheard,'
109      'Listen.'
110      'We are the Sisters Unseen.'
111      'Watch.'

113      'Die.'
114      'We are the Sisters.'

127      "N, no, this isn't working out    at all!"
128      The ErosTemp snapped gum blandly.  _You did say a memo, didn't you, sir?_
129      "Not now... I'm preoccupied!"      The disembodied voice hovered just
130 over the opaque desk.
131      _Whenever._
132      The voice concentrated its         'presence' over a Zone Calendar that
133 was spread wide over the desktop.       As the voice 'moved' its 'vision' from 
134 one area to another, the Calendar       complied, shifting its area of display 
135 along like parameters.  "This just      won't work out.  There isn't any...    
136 There isn't any AMBIANCE to Pyrrixall   as it stands...  Damn these communal   
137 realities!"
138      _Flowers?_
139      "I'm talking CREATIVE ambiance.    Look, think back to every single 
140 collective 'shared-world' type reality  you can think of.  What do they all
141 have in common?"
142      _Loose ends?  Plot threads?        Non-Committal Values?_
143      "Gathering places!"  The voice     drew the ErosTemp's admittedly vapid
144 attention to a thick Terran book that   lay on the desk near the Calendar.
145 "Look at this!  They had The Vulgar     Unicorn... They had Callahan's...
146 They had Elsewhere... Ithcar's Caravan  ... the whole planet Darkover, for     
147 crying out loud.  And what have we      got?"
148      _Factual or Consoling?_
149      "Nothing!  Zero!  Zip!  Zephyr     may have created the grounwork with
150 this Temporal Enforcer bit...  but      Pyrrixall STILL doesn't have what it 
151 needs to be a fully functioning reality Shared-World environment!  It lacks... 
152 cameradery... togetherness... a place   where all the Medalic Prophet's        
153 characters can go and get completely    smashed before the next adventure      
154 starts up."
155      _I wouldn't know._
156      "You'd get drunk on occasion too   if you kept travelling halfway around
157 the universe only to end up back at     the bar where you started from.  We    
158 were doing it with The Inn for YEARS!   Really!"
159      _Really?_
160      "Really!"
161      _Really._
162      "And that's just what's MISSING    from Pyrrixall!  We've got this Zone
163 relationship between the Prophets...    They make their Zones, share Zones with
164 other Prophets... but we STILL don't    have a place for the Prophet's
165 characters to meet the characters of    another Prophet's, down a few whiskeys 
166 and save the cosmos...  A good stiff    drink'll start the ball rolling every  
167 time.  Audiences THRIVE on the barroom  atmosphere coupled with a fantasy or   
168 science fiction setting."
169      _Forgive me for asking..._
170      "Yes?"
171      _If each Zone is connected to      another Zone at a given time, but the
172 connections between Zones shift in      minute-long transitions, how can you
173 possibly set up a place where every     Zone can meet every Zone at any time?_
174      "That's the bugger of Zephyr's     system... It simply doesn't allow for
175 a real-level meeting place."
176      _You could try a central hub, and  make it the bar..._
177      "I thought of that... but it just  doesn't jibe well with the reality
178 hounds.  A BAR being the central point  of an entire planet's reality scape?   
179 I don't think so."
180      _Why not?_
181      The voice was silent for many      long moments.  Then, "You know
182 something... you're right.  SCREW the   Reality Critics!  Let's open this      
183 puppy up right now!"
184      _And your memo?_
185      "Oh yes, right, right."  The       voice cleared its non-corporeal 
186 throat.  "To all Medalic Prophets...    Pyrrixall will be undergoing a minor  
187 reality shift...  You will all notice   that there has been an addition to     
188 your usual BorderZone Gateway.  You     should now also see, to the left of    
189 every Gateway, a large..."  His presence shifted over to the ErosTemp.   
190 "What sort of door should it be?"
191      _Gold, with a lion knocker?_
192      "Right... A large golden door      with a Lion'sHead Knocker...  I like
193 it.  Smooth yet tacky.  It works."  He  prided himself for a few brief moments
194 before continuing.  "...  A large       golden door with a Lion'sHead Knocker.
195 This is the Gateway that leads to the   Central Hub of Pyrrixall... a gathering
196 and meeting place that exists in a      parallel Zone outside of the usual     
197 BorderZone shift...  Do not be alarmed, use it to your satisfaction, and please
198 make all subordinate characters in your corrall aware of its function.  It is  
199 our intent to see that..."  He stopped  again.  "We need a name."
200      _Eros' Place?_
201      "Too flimpy."
202      _Flirt's._
203      "Too Terry."
204      _Callahan's._ the Temp winked.
205      "Why not just call it the          Titanic?  PLEASE!"
206      _How about Backwaters?_
207      "I *love* it!"  He continued...    "It is our intent to see that 
208 Backwaters becomes a common ground      where citizens from the various Zones  
209 that make up our little communal        reality can meet and gorge themselves  
210 as equals.  Thank you."
211      _Will that be all?_
212      "For now, Eros-21."
213      _I'll have it sent out right       away, Mister Day..."

226  
227      The golden door that led to the    BorderZone of Central City blew open
228 with a fetid blast of deathwarm steam   and sickly yellow neon mist.  Droves 
229 of feral flies skittered towards the    opening from Zephyr's side, but were   
230 summarily electrocuted by protective    wards, and turned elsewhere for their  
231 nightly entertainment.  The thin beam   of moonlight from Central City's triad 
232 of natural sattelites lit the polished  wooden floor of Backwaters, the prime
233 gathering place of the myriad of        dimensional entities that made the     
234 world, or perhaps worlds, of Pyrrixall  their home.
235      From the heart of the mist         skulked a shadowy being, his image
236 barely discernable from the dank        lighting, even then fading in and out  
237 like the grim silhouette cast by a      flickering flame.  As the being        
238 entered, it tipped a wide brimmed       black hat upwards with one leather     
239 gloved hand, the better to take in      the atmosphere of its new environment. 
240 Twin eyes of green, faintly red in      the center, absorbed each shape and    
241 contour in the richly furnished         establishment.  The figure crossed     
242 the threshhold, the blackmetal spurs    on the knee high boots clanking almost,
243 but not quite silently, against the     oaken floorboards.  It paused for a    
244 brief moment at the doorway, looking    at the bartender polishing glasses     
245 at the other end of the hallway thaat    led to the main barroom of Backwaters.
246 "Quiet night."
247      "Doesn't get much quieter than     this."  The bartender, a jovial old
248 Terran with a scraggley red beard,      finished his polishing.  "Belly up,
249 son..."  He gestured a broad, powerful  hand towards the empty barstools.
250      "I don't mind if I do..." He       allowed the edges of his obsidion
251 cloak to drop to the floor and expand   outwards on an invisible wind, the
252 edges grasping at the almost intangible substance of his visible form.  His    
253 hat again slipped over his eyes, and    his collar widened as he walked.  The  
254 silver buttons that ran the length of   his coat corroded into a dull russet   
255 hue in seconds.  
256      "Haven't seen you around here      before..."
257      "You haven't seen much of anyone   here before., I'd wager."
258      "To be expected.  Day only         included us in the relative reality
259 a few days ago."
260      "True.  Don't worry, I'm sure      that business will pick up before too
261 long."  He managed a weak grin.
262      The barkeep returned the gesture.  "Me?  Worry?  Day pays the bills for
263 this place, not me.  I'm just a minor   supporting player..."  He motioned     
264 towards the empty black box that sat    behind him on a silver rack.  "Can I   
265 get you anything?"
266      The visitor nodded.  "Dry martini  with a Terran accent..."
267      The drink appeared in the box,     and the barkeep passed it along.  He
268 tapped gently on the box.  "Praise      Schrodinger..."
269      The visitor chuckled.  "Or maybe   you shouldn't... I can't decide."  His
270 mood seemed to waver between content    and disturbed.
271      The visitor sipped his drink       from a thin red straw that led to
272 thin red lips.  There was an audible    silence.  "You're one of Zephyr's crew,
273 aren't you?"
274      The visitor sighed.  "Presumably.  Though I can't say much for his taste
275 in relative realities.  I wouldn't put  a dog in Central City, much less a 
276 textual representation of myself."
277      "Go figure...  I'll never pretend  to understand authors."
278      "Who could?"  He spread his hands  and spoke dramatically.  "They work 
279 in -+-mysterious-+- *ways*!"  The       visitor extended a hand.  "Winston   
280 Pale..."
281      The barkeep shook it, surprised    by its coolness, even through the black
282 leather.  "Tolkien Lovecraft, at your   service."
283      Winston fanned himself.  "Is it    always so terribly hot in here?"  He
284 slipped off the leather gloves to       reveal pallid, milky skin and short    
285 black fingernails, placing the twin     accessories in a pocket that Tolkien
286 could have sworn he hadn't noticed      before... a wide zipper arrangement    
287 along the left collar.
288      "So what's your angle?" Tolkien    asked conversationally.
289      "I don't know... to be brutally    honest.  Zephyr hasn't given me one...
290 THE Zephyr, I mean..."  He spun the     ice in his drink with the straw.
291 "Mmmmmm...  Protagonist, maybe?         Observer?  Perhaps a little of both?"
292      "Looks like you just found out."
293      "I guess so... even if it was a    little backhanded fourth wall bit..."
294      "It's the price you pay..."
295      "... To be self defining, you      mean?  Not as blissy as it's cracked
296 up to be in the trade journals... Just  a lot of fluffy confusion and no real  
297 direction."
298      The bartender nodded, almost       sympathetically.  "How do you think I
299 feel?  I'M usually an author's outlet   to get in touch with his cast... and
300 it looks like THIS discussion is no     exception..."
013=Usr:368 Nemesis Warlock   07/21/90 23:23  Msg:5405 Call:30201 Lines:129
301      "How true..."
302      "But it's refreshing to see that   at least Zephyr isn't intimidated by
303 self-referential texts.  Or innate      randetermined character development."
304      "Nothing I could do if he          weren't...  Hell, I'm just glad to be
305 alive, and glad that I get the chance   to wait 'til it's all over...  however 
306 long that might be."
307      Tolkien pointed at the empty       glass.  "Another?"
308      Winston rose, his cape, not a      cloak now, swaying gently in the
309 absent wind, the frayed edges darting   in and out of Tolkien's peripheral
310 vision.  "I don't think so...  I'd      better be moving along..."
311      "Nice talking to you, Mister       Pale..."
312      "Winston."
313      "Winston."
314      "And it was nice talking to you,   as well, my good man..."  Winston
315 gathered himself together and drew      his hat down over his eyes,whisping 
316 towards the golden door that led back   to Central City.  He turned and        
317 saluted.  "Be seeing you."  He opened   the door and stepped through.
318  
319 *^*^*
320  
321      Time imploded, and the world       disintegrated into a blazing miniature
322 light.  Then, just as suddenly, time    resumed its clockwork course, and the
323 light gave bitth to sight and taste and smell and sound and touch...
324  
325 *^*^*
326  
327      Winston wandered away from the     throngs of escapees who were plunging
328 headlong into the Gateway next to the   golden door.  He pitied them.  So 
329 eager were they to escape the iron      grip of Central City's dictator that   
330 they were willing to risk utter         destruction by fleeing into a new      
331 BorderZone blind.  Without a map, it    was almost impossible to discern just  
332 which world one might end up in when    passing through a Gateway at random.
333  
334      He soon found himself in an old    abandonded cemetary somewhere in the
335 Networks, the havens for the wretched   souls reduced to petty pickpocketing
336 to survive.  He restedd on a fat white   coffinstone and looked up into the    
337 starry sky... The thick blanket of      yellow mist having thinned out with    
338 the coming of midnight.
339      "Why am I here?"  he asked.
340      you have a job to do
341      "What sort of a 'job?'  Why can't  you tell me?"
342      it isnt my place
343      "Damn you."
344      that may already be true, im       afraid winston
345      that may already be true
346      "Why continue this?"
347      why not
348      "It isn't FAIR!  I could be a      child, or a magician, or a powerful
349 emperor.  I could hurl bolts of light   and command the elements.  WHY can't I 
350 fly free?"  His white hands clenched    together tightly, his pained expression
351 wracking his pale, elfin features.
352      you are what you are i cannot      change that it is for the best
353      "You areinhuman..."
354      no just too human
355      "Then I don't want to BE a human.  I don't want to be part of this sick
356 game.  Adventure!  Romance!  Thrills!   Chills!  Suspense!"
357      stop
358      "Intrigue!  Action!  Fun!  Comedy! Erotica!"
359      you arent being fair with me now   stop it and calm down

361      please

366 have to
367      "Don't go soft on me!  You spin    these webs of death and blood... you

369 "Even now you can't resist the shock    value.  It teases and torments.  Come  
370 on, let's get REALLY down and dirty     with this!  You started it."
371      you did

373      youre self referential you can     think whatever you want
374      "Because YOU WANT me to be self    referential.  Just like you made 
375 Michael and Mukluk Solid Protagonists,  the Anglers and Zephyr Antagonists...  
376 Hell, you even made Tolkien Lovecraft   a Go-Between for the whole mess.  You  
377 LOVE it!"
378      i hate it

380 not just STOP!?  Come on!  Do it!  Do   it!"

402      remember that everything i do      with you happens for a reason even
403 this its all part of the same basic     design youll see eventually what the   
404 reasoning was

406 other worlds... even when you use some  other medium...  You've made me aware, 
407 and I've discovered some things about   you that I'm not sure I like... As for 
408 the violence... you're no more guilty   than anyone with an imagination... it's
409 why stories can only be told with some  sort of CONFLICT.  That's what you
410 are creating here...  But that energy   could be put to good use elsewhere.    
411 Damnit, you're YOUNG and INDUSTRIOUS    and CREATIVE and those aren't just     
412 bragging, self-centered accolades.      They aren't even accolades.  Just GO

435 A weekend spent driving around, expelling fossel fuels into the atmosphere. On 
436 Saturday, spent all day moving a friend from aproximately 82nd and Duke to 
437 aproximately Walker and Murray.  In 100 degree weather, it was a labor of love.
438 Sunday was a little funner, went out in search of garage sales from 10:00 A.M. 
439 to 5:00 P.M..  Drove all over Portland, in search of furniture for yet another
440 friend who has an empty apartment.  Found a couple things, but the day was for 
441 the most part a wash-out.  Did have lunch at the Skyline resturant on the 
442 corner of Cornell and Skyline.  Fresh strawberries in the milkshake really
443 made it special.  Bacon burger was cheap and great too.  Barbeque last night
444 out in the backyard, (more burgers) grapes taste great too.

447      Winston Pale reached into Aa pocket that had been a leather strap seconds
448 ago and withdrew a long, thin cigarette that didn't really exist.  A match
449 flared into life in the air next to     his right hand, and he took it, setting
450 the edge of the white stick ablaze and  allowing the useless match to blow     
451 itself out of reality.  He drew the     stick to his lips and sucked in the    
452 raw sensation of the facimile, his      lungs burning from imaginary smoke, his
453 nerves flooded by intangible nicotine,  his perfect teeth unstained despite    
454 the false clouds of smoke that swirled  from his mouth through tighly pursed   
455 lips, swinging away on an all to real   wind that carried them off to mingle   
456 with the neon yellow mists of night in  Central City... Zephyr's domain.
457      Not the Zephyr he had spoken to    the night before in the cemetary... the
458 frightened youth a heartbeat from this  reality who stuttered away at a 
459 bespeckled keypad.  The other Zephyr... the grim Author's localized, imagined  
460 Revisionist interpretation of the dark  corners of his own soul... the evil    
461 little Anti-Zephyr, the petty, foul     beast that Zephyr the Earth-Child kept 
462 hidden, just as everyman and anyman     hid his own beast, his own Anti-Self.  
463      Winston couldn't help being what   he was... the Eternal Tourguide... the 
464 Giver of Direction... the Observer...   but most importantly, Pale the   
465 Self-Referential...  Hearer of Voices.  The voices spoke to him even now, a dim
466 buzz when he wasn't listening back,     but nevertheless there, with their     
467 confusing hum of puce nonsense aand      gibbering drive... libido and tar...  
468 plastic frenzy and orange innuendo on   green glassware.  He heard the buzz.   
469 He felt the Earth as it rotated in his  spirit's mind's eye.  He blew another  
470 smoke ring.
471      He ignored the voices and strolled down a Network alley.  For some twisted
472 reason, he liked it here.  The screams  of the pathetic were quieter, often cut
473 short by a dirty red blade or a lead    shell long as a Patriot's fingernails. 
474 He liked it here.  Loved it here.       Lived here, if anywhere.  It was as    
475 good as any, and certainly better than  the primary alternatve.
476      He could feel that he was growing  older as the moments ticked by in story
477 time...  He had only been alive in      reality for a day, but here in 
478 Pyrrixall he was almot 50...  and his  whole life had already happened,        
479 somehow.  Tie between the worlds was   nonexistant...  It was simply taken for
480 granted that he was an old man...  He   could remember the childhood that had  
481 never really happened, that was only a  brief flicker of plot substance created
482 on an alien keyboard in a distant realm that he had and could never have known.
483 Not that he would ever want to.  He     liked this reality just fine, and who  
484 was to say who was more 'real'...       Perhaps Zephyr, the Earth-Zephyr, was  
485 the transient dream in the night that   had given birth to Pyrrixaland   
486 Michael the Enforcer and Mukluk and     Tolkien Lovecraft and Backwaters and   
487 Central City and Winston annd...  It     didn't matter.  Best just to live  
488 with it and enjoy things.
489      Being self-creating did have its   advantages, though.  Reality was a 
490 foolish joke to the Outside Voice, the  Zephyr-Thing that clung to the corners 
491 of his mind.  The real, little boy      Zephyr who wrote didn't worry about the
492 confines of Winston's reality... that   had been part of his creation and false
493 childhood and psuedo-puberty and        auto-focused adulthood and misanthropic
494 maturity.  If he wanted a gun, it was   there.
495      The pistol appeared in his right   hand.  He fired a bullet through the
496 soft flesh of his head, yet the wound   closed itself and the bullet faded out 
497 of reality.  He forced himself to       remember the brief sensation and stored
498 it somewhere n the phantasmal thing he tried to call a mind, though such was 
499 an impossibility when he was being      dictated to by an unseen presence that 
500 he could only feel and somtimes hear.
501      Winston had often entertained the  notion that the Zephyr-Thing, the 
502 User-Thing, was a product of his OWN    mind, and not the other way around.    
503 Who was to say whether or not Winston's coming into being had not directly or  
504 indirectly brought forth thelife and   thought of the Zephyr-Thing that 
505 claimed the truth to be his own... the  mantle of reality to be his birthright.
506 Who was to say that his mother had not  been real, had not felt the ripping    
507 screams of labor or soft ice cream      spilling down her sore throat and into 
508 her expanding womb?  WWho could say      that those things WEREN'T more than   
509 story elements brought into being by the Zephyr-Thing that Winston should have 
510 hated,, but somehow did not.
511      Yes, Winston could have anything   he wanted... His was reality, reality 
512 was his.  He could toy with it and tease it and seduce it... and even rape it  
513 if the thougt ever crossed his mind,   which it did not.  Pain was real, and 
514 was the UNIVERSAL reality.
515      Pain... and desire...
516      ... But mostly pain.
517      He coughed on invisible smoke, and looked out at the sky, winking at the
518 invisible Zephyr-Thing. 
519      "Baby, is it good for you, too?"

522  
523      Zephyr trudged across the  cold     tile floor for what seemed like the
524 fourteenth time that night.  Already    the sickly morning birds that perched
525 on the higher skyscrapers were          commencing their daily vigil with a    
526 raspy song.
527      He approached the mail alarm that  had disrupted his fitful sleep, 
528 pressing the thin wafer on the marble   stand and allowing it to expand into
529 a serviceable cam-screen.
530      --Zephyr!  Thank gracious that     I've gotten through!--
531      "*Why not?  It's 2:00 am... not    the peak hours of the system.*"  Damn
532 these servobots...  Tact wasn't a       function.
533      --Forgive me, your excellency...   It's the Emperor...--
534      Zephyr yawned in boredom and       fatigue.  "*What of him?*"
535      --He's taken leave, I'm afraid.     Stepped through a random Gateway
536 without so much as a map.--
537      "*No word?*"
538      --Not for several hours.--
539      He turned away and began walking   back towards the bedroom, running a
540 hand through his tousled red hair.      Anything he did on this end didn't
541 matter... The image the servobot saw    was a computer-generated, pristine     
542 Zephyr.  "*Right and well...  If he     lives... kill him.*"
543      --SIR?--
544      "*The Emperor has obviously        taken a leave of his senses.  We've no
545 use for that sort of behavior in our    Regime.  Now leave me be and NEVER
546 call upon me again at this hour.... or  I shall be forced to contemplate what  
547 might be done with servo-eyes...*"
548      --Yes, well...-- The robot gulped  nutri-sludge.  --Er, very good sir.--
549 The image vanished.
550      Damn it all, Zephyr thought as he  struggled to remain awake on his way
551 back to his bedchambers, now I suppose  I shall have to appoint someone else   
552 to the position of PR activities...     I wonder if Johannas Swift would be    
553 amenable...  Or shall I create someone  new?  Perhaps-
554      A figure burrowed out of the       thick silk covers on the canopy bed.
555 "Who was that, milord?  You look        troubled..."
556      He smiled weakly.  *Affairs of    State.  Don't let it concern you,
557 Joshua.  I'm just considering some      candidates for a... vacancy.*"  
558      "Well and good, milord."  
559      Zephyr forced a grin.  "*Quite...  Now...*"  He took his place beside
560 the autumn-haired youth.  "*I believe   that we were-*"
561      The bay window that looked out     at the horizon shattered in a tide of
562 PlastiGlass, which disintigrated before touching the canopy bed or its 
563 occupants.
564      "I should think, my Lord, that     you would install better security at
565 these higher levels..."  Winston Pale   levitated up through the window, the   
566 smouldering, dripping head of a         Patriot Guardsman, Zephyr's private    
567 security force, in each hand.  He       allowed the wreckage to clatter        
568 noisily to the floor, sending Joshua    cowering under the sheets.  "Oh, but   
569 forgive me."  Winston bowed floridly.   "I had no idea you were indisposed....
570 Else I might not have made such an      unruly entrance...  Then again, I      
571 probably would have, anyway."
572      Zephyr seethed.  "*I'll have       you-*"
573      "As a guest!  Nothing mmore...      Remember who you're dealing with."
574      "*I know who you are.*"
575      "Then you know that you can't      touch me.  If it bothers you, you
576 know who to talk to."
577      "*Why has HE orchestrated this?*"
578      "Probably to let you know that     I'm back from my voyages, and perhaps
579 because he thinks you've gotten a bit   too callous for your own good."
580      "*...*"
581      "Oh, I see you're speechless with  joy at my unexpected return."
582      "*Not...likely.*"
583      "Milord?" Joshua managed a weak    whisper from behind the protection of
584 goosedown.
585      "Worry not, my good lad.  I'll     not harm you.  Wouldn't want to disturb
586 the Commandant by teasing his new       pet."
587      "*State your business and begone.  I've more to do than mince words with
588 the likes of you.*"
589      "Yes."  Winston gave a sly winkk.   "I can see that."  He drew back his
590 wide fedora, allowing wild black hair   to spring up haphazardly.  "Not

593      "*This being...?*"
594      "Only this...  my, ah, SOURCE      has informed me that Pyrrixall's 
595 dimensions are to be visited by an      unknown enigma...  He will be a dark
596 traveller bearing sad news..."          Winston's green eyes narrowed, and his 
597 skin became even more white than        usual, especially in the flourescent   
598 lights.  "You MUST treat this visitor   as a brother in arms.  REGARDLESSof 
599 his allegiances."
600      "*Dreamer...*"
601      "I didn't say that."  Winston      made another grand gesture.  "And with 
602 that, I'll be off.  Any messages that   you might want to send over to my...   
603 SOURCE?"
604      "*Only this...  Recursive reality  can sometimes work both ways...  I'll
605 have to arrange  little talk with      your SOURCE...*"
606      Winston couldn't help a grin.      "Oh, dthat.  Perhaps we'll all meet   
607 again in a  grand debate of literary     tastes.  Preta-Na-Ma, good Commandant,
608 faithful pet.  I take my leave of your  -----illustrious----- presence..."     
609 Pale vanishd into the night.
610      "What does it all mean, milord?"
611      "*I wish I knew.  Thing are        changing on Pyrrixall.*"
612      "Is it not said by the Tanisian    Whales 'Change is for the better'?"

653 INTERLUDE I - The Steel Covenant
654  
655      
656      "Oh, I dare say, DEUCE of a good   play, Elizabeth, luv..."  The man with
657 the red tophat saluted his female       companion across the table.
658      "Why... why THANK you, Jack.  You  know I've never been any good at
659 Poker..." She waved a crimson fan       back and forth near her face, and then 
660 drew up the russet chips piled high     in the center of the table.
661      "You should have folded when you   had the chance, Jack, like I did."
662 The fellow with the firey jacket        leaned back in his chair, all smiles,  
663 and lit a cigarette with a sulpher      tipped match.
664      "Did I ask your advice,            Theodore?  I believe not, my dear
665 fellow."  Jack reached for the bottle   near the place where the pile had been 
666 and poured himself another glass of     dark wine.  It poured like blood into  
667 the crystal glass, seemingly becoming   thick and congealed as the liquid      
668 ceased its bubbling and rippling.
669      "M'lady!  Gentlemen!  This IS,     after all, a civilized match, is it
670 not?  And we *are* civilized, are we    not?"
671      "Point taken, Edward."  Elizabeth  blushed.
672      "Forgive m."  Jack stood and      bowed floridly.  "It would appear that 
673 the intensity of my playing session     left me rather indisposed."  He        
674 returned to his seat.
675      "Accepted."  Theodore tapped the   eddge of his rusty lighter against the 
676 cherrywood tabletop.  "And I believe    it would serve us all best if we let   
677 the statement conclude our evening of   gaming.  There is much to do when      
678 morning comes, and I, for one, do not   wish to attempt my goals while         
679 nursing a frightful case of the         redeye."  He excused himself, and      
680 vanished into the next room.
681      "Charming fellow."  Jack's         demeanor betrayed the true feelings
682 behind his words.  "But nevertheless,   he has made a valid point.  I believe  
683 that the time HAS come for me to also   take my leave of your company for this 
684 evening.  G'night, all, and may your    dreams be sweet."  Drawing a ruby cane
685 from its resting place beside the       table, Jack trotted out the door,      
686 closing it after a grand sweep of his   blood-velvet cape.
687      "SO..."  Edward sidled closer to   Elizabeth's position on the plaid
688 couch.  "I would suppose that that      leaves only us, this evening."
689      "Oh, Edward." Elizabeth looked     down her strawberry ball gown.  "This  
690 really HAS been the best of evenings.   And so much is left...  To taste and   
691 touch and feel... I adore having it     all once more... The wild sensation of 
692 and sensuality of it..."  She frowned,  worriedly.  "You DO understand what I  
693 mean, Edward, don't you?"
694      He grasped her trembling hand and  stroked it gently.  "Of course I do,   
695 Elizabeth.  Of course I do..."  He      cooed soothingly.  "We'll have it all. 
696 Every last bit."
697      "Forever."
698      "I promise."
699      "It all went away before.  It was  so dreadful.  Cold.  Pain.  I..."  Her 
700 rose-colored lips trembled.  "I don't   want to go back..."
701      "None of us do.  And none of us    will.  You'll see, once this is over.
702 We'll all have a place.  And we'll be   happy."
703      "Why do you think they wanted US,  Edward.  We're all so different..."
704      "Not in the ways that are the      most important."  He lookeed deep into 
705 her autumn eyes, and then reached into  his pocket.  "I have something for     
706 you.  A present."
707      "For me?  Why-"
708      "Shhh."  He placed the circlet of  steel over her finger...
709      "Oh... God...  My God..."  She     held the ruby up to the light.
710 "Pigeonblood..."
711      "Only the best for you, Miss       Borden...  Only the best."
712

735      In a dirty alleyway, Pale was      casually observing a Patriot hosing
736 down a sleeping vagrant with powerful   acid sprayers.  The resulting pool of  
737 raw genetic material was drawn up and   the alley drenched with CleansWater,   
738 after which the Patriot took to the     skies, rocket pods crackling.
739      Pale looked skyward.  "Pointless   Death?"
740      not really i was trying to         emphasize the callous nature of a
741 given patriot i think it worked dont    you
742      "Perhaps, for the gore mongers     out there.  I delivered the message."
743      i know
744      "Of course."
745      zephyr should be acting on it      relatively soon he isnt thrilled about
746 your modus operendi though im getting   some nasty vibes from him
747      "That's what you get when you try  and split up your personality like
748 this.  A conceptual entity for every    facet...  You're well on your way to a 
749 good case of a split personality        disorder."  He gestured dramatically.  
750 "A character for every mood!  A name for every thought!  Feel guilty about 
751 your evil urges?  Just give 'em a name  and they VANISH!  Ta-da!"
752      i didnt come here to be taunted    pale
753      Pale made himself look hurt.  "Oh, and why then?"
754      you need to go to the astral       dream the conference will be there and
755 i want you to serve as observer think   you can manage or should i jaunt you   
756 there offscreen
757      "I'm feeling industrious today.    I'll stroll."
758      fine but be there 
759      "You want me to be there?"
760      yes
761      "Then how could I not show up?"
762      true but I still had to tell you   for continuity you couldnt just be 
763 there all of a sudden could you
764      "I suppose you're right.  Now, I   want to have a word with you about
765 that vagrant."
766      i needed to show that
767      Pale spread his hands.  "Oh, yes!  Yes!  Of course!  But just think of it
768 this way...  You showed them..."  He    looked up again.  "It's up there in 
769 storage.  Why not just bring him back?  For me?"
770      it would be silly
771      Pale darkeneed.  "Do it."
772  
773      The vagrant hobbled over to        Pale.  "Thankye fur savin' me life
774 from that godAwful Rezz-Bucket, mih     lad!  Mad Buck 2112?"  He offered the  
775 Observer a bottle wrapped in plastic.
776      "No thanks.  I'm contriving."
777      "Oh well... Maybe nex' time?       See y'round?"
778      "Perhaps."
779      The vagrant laughed as he was      swept away into the thick yellow
780 mist...
781      there feel better
782      "Much."
783      yes                                i suppose i do too

794 INTERLUDE II - Interm
795  
796      In the Networks, a group of six    boys fell victim to a lamb's axe.
797  
798      In Central Hall, two Empirical     Candidates made a suicide pact using
799 red balloons.
800  
801      A maid in Lapina Square's          Truffle Heights lept from 800 stories
802 up in an attempt to escape from         militant surveillance devices.
803  
804      Vendors in Central Square staged   a protest demonstration.  The streets
805 ran red with blood and katsup.
806  
807      A kitten owned by an elderly       couple in MiddleTown briefly molested
808 her owners and did away with the bodies by stuffing them in a feather mattress.
809  
810      Plums began to spew Terran         Pavorrati when struck by ExpressLaners
811 upon whose road they rested.
812  
813      A screaming girl battered herself  into a nunnery near SimpleTon.
814  
815      Phantom retrievers stormed the     SkyLine.  None were safe from their
816 pelting gazes.
817  
818      A thick black computer virus       regulated itself to only two Patriots,
819 forcing them into bizarre contortions   on the steps of Zephyr Plaza.
820  
821      The Citizen's News broadcast a     teleplay from Terra-Cultist Programs.
822 The Actors were Serpents.
823  
824      Freedom conceptualized itself but  was killed by a runaway tricyclist from
825 RedBreadth.
826  
827      Ten hedonistic elves sought      Innis Square, thinking evil red
828 suggestions.

833 Amanda paused as the lightning streaked across the sky.  Strange, she thought,
834 that a storm should rise so quickly where the sun had glared only moments 
835 before.  she looked down at the book in her hand, then returned to shelving
836 the stack before her.
837 Twenty minutes later, all of the stack carefully placed in order on the shelf,
838 all but one book, the same one she had held before, another flash caused her
839 to pause.  Curious about the odd coincidence, she took a closer looked at the
840 book.  *Journeying* in gold lettering was scrawled across the front cover.  No
841 author was listed.
842   *Almost done?*  a high voice called out across the room, from behind a half
843 dozen shelves.
844   *Yes*  She stuffed the book into the rack.
845  
846 Leaving the library, she barely noticed the drops of water dotting the pavement
847 Her mother would call tonight to see if she had found a date yet, The bills had
848 to be paid, and her car was probably still not fixed.  the rain beat harder,
849 and she pulled out her umbrella.  more and more of the other pedestrians ducked
850 beneath the store awnings, but she passed without a glance.  If only there were
851 some way to escape the drudgery of the library and find a more interesting life
852 Maybe if she'd done something in college, maybes seldom were.
853 Pulling out her key, she unlocked the door of her apartment, and slipped in.
854 Stumbling over a package, she fumbled for the light switch.  I wasn'
855 t expecting a package, her mind raced.  closing the door behind her, she 
856 scooped it up, and collapsed on the couch.
857  
858 ..........more to come?

885 The Yakima Indian Nation Tribal Police is on revenue enhancement drive
886 otherwise known as SPEED TRAP along isolated strip of State Highway 97.
887 The Indian braves stay as late in the night ambushing unsuspecting motorists,
888 who happened to be passing through.

892 it seems, the Indian Tribal police concentrates on motorists.  It could be 
893 the reason for the high crime rates.

918      "So you understand my position on  this matter, Emmisary?"  Zephyr stared
919 blankly in the Wanderer's general direction, always seemingly distracted though
920 by a speck of dust or another patron of Backwaters.
921      "We understand each-other..." the  Wanderer corrected.  "I also think you 
922 understand your... counterpart's status on this matter.  I'm sure he's made it 
923 evident."
924      "Quite."  Zephyr absently corrected Joshua, who was rapidly devouring a 
925 plate of shrimp, handing him proper utensils.  "Now, I'm more than willing to  
926 follow you into the Astral Dream... But I'm not going to be a party to the 
927 ludicrous norm..."  He gestured, almost as if by accident, to the lumbering    
928 Patriot that clamped back and forth across the doorway that led to Central City
929 and to Zephyr's domain.  "That sort of  thing won't be tolerated."
930      "We can arrange immediate transportation directly to the conference room
931 from beyond the BBackwaters doorway to the Astral Dream...  If that is what you
932 wish."
933      His eyes darkened.  "That is what  I wish."
934      "Are we really going to the ASTRAL DREAM?"  Joshua put down the glass he
935 had been sipping a viscous black liquid from.  "...*wow*..."  He sat back in 
936 his chair, evidently stunned by the very thought.
937      "Hush."  Zephyr gathered together  his belongings and his companion.  
938 "While we're in the Dream, Joshua, you'll be under the care of Patriot Prime.."
939      The great beast bowed dramatically to Zephyr's moll.  #At your command,

941      "Felling..!"  
942      Zephyr brushed loose hair from Joshua's face.  "Yes, quite.  Now, we're
943 going to be involved in some deep negotiations with the Astral Dream and the
944 Tanisian Whales...  You may attend, but only as an observer.  The whole 
945 experiece should be most educational."
946      The Wanderer shifted uncomfortably. "Yes..  Well, then, shall we be off?"

980 "Three hundred and fifty copper pennies?" quavered the soft voice of the thin
981 alien as he(it?) eyed the motley collection of dusty parts.
982 "For the lot of it" stated the greasy fat shopkeeper, leaning down to drag 
983 yet more piles of old junk out from under the table. "Your sure to be able
984 to get your ship running, lookie here, a complete navigational module!"
985   He placed the filthy old computer part on top of the pile.  Dust coated
986 the circuit boards so thickly it was impossible to tell what color they
987 might have originally been.  With trepedation the alien brushed a finger along
988 the side of the case, noting the number beneath.
989 "How do I know any of this even works?" he said.
990 "Well, it was all working when it came out of the console!" grumbled the 
991 owner, "I pulled it myself!"
992 The alien sighed. "Here is your money"
993  He pulled a small bag out of a pocket and dropped the money on the counter, 
994 then bent down to lift the old box.
995 "Hey! the box isn't part of the deal! That'll be five pens more!" The 
996 shopkeeper shook his finger. "They aren't cheap y' know!"
997 Dutifully, the alien dposited five more pennies on the table and hefted the
998 box.  He wasn't going to argue, what with being luckey enough to find the
999 only remaining XP647 unit that appeared intact.   +++++++Ariel++++++++++++
