20 Voyuer: I'm unaware of any problem, but I'll check into it. I've never
21 had a glitch before, but it is always possible for a first time. I don't
22 check the files as a rule, because after a year of transferring files
23 with absolutly no errors I got tired of doing so, as it took a great deal of 
24 time, so I rely on the system of telling that something went wrong, which
25 it usually does. Ala read error. I've never had a problem copying files on
26 my CPM system, but that is because it took me two years of programming and
27 mucking around with the 1771/1793 disk controller to find out how to 
28 handle it with out getting any errors. It has a distinct habit of letting
29 errors through unanounce unless you know how to deal with it. (it has to
30 do with head bounce, yes, head bounce on a floppy, the most common cause
31 of soft errors on a floopy disk - that is if the drivers don't know how to
32 deal with it)... where was I? Oh yeah, I'll check into it and get back to you.

52      Soli took one last look around the Inn.  He was no longer to visit it as
53 he would like, but he stilled stopped in when he could and see what was about.
54 Stories he used to follow closely were now sometimes hard to understand, but
55 that was to be expected.  He smiled, sure that he had listened to all there
56 was to hear.  He made a small guesture and muttered a few words.  And with
57 that, he disappeared...

61    "You're lying!" James snarled, "She took a twenty millimeter slug in the stomach and died in my arms! Damn it, I...
62 I watched her die!" The bitter memory brought tears to his eyes for about the hundredth time.
63    Marannon shook her head. "Tariya is resting in her chambers at my palace in a healing trance. Her wound was
64 grievious, and it will be several weeks before she is fully recovered."
65    He wanted to ask how, but did it really matter? "Did... did she say anything about me?"
66    "She hasn't regained conciousness. But she will recover completely, in time. But right now you should be more
67 concerned with your own fate. Fortunately for you, I am not without gratitude." She reached into a pocket and pulled
68 out a small gem. It pulsed with a radiant blue light in perfect synch with James' heartbeat, responding to his power
69 even at that distance. Staring at it, he finally managed to struggle to his feet. Instantly he felt stronger. "I
70 believe this is what you have been searching for."
71    She came forward a step and placed the gem in his palm. The second he touched it, the light died. What he was
72 holding might as well have been a piece of glass. "What's the matter with it?"
73    "A precaution I have taken. You see, the gem has been placed under a very powerful oathspell. You must swear an
74 oath before you can use it, and if you later break the oath, the gem's power will fade and you will die."
75    He looked at her suspiciously. "And what kind of oath am I supposed to swear?"
76    "Oh, a very simple one," she said offhandedly. "One that will cost you little. You must never attempt to see or
77 have any contact with Tariya again."
78    His mouth fell open and it took a minute before he could speak. "Why?"
79    Still offhandedly, she explained. "You see, my daughter loves you very much. More than you probably imagine. But
80 you are a bad influence on her. You posess great power and almost never use it responsibly. You are dangerous. Tariya
81 deserves better than that. When she awakes, she will be told that, regrettably, you died in the assault on the council
82 building. Her feelings will be shattered, but she will survive and ultimately be better off."
83    He stared at her for a long moment. "No." He finaly said, "That's not it at all. You're afraid of me. When I
84 finally get all my power back I'll be a threat to you and whatever dictatorship you're gonna start. You think that by
85 separating me from Tariya that you'll never have to worry about me again. Right?"
86    Surprisingly, she wouldn't meet his eyes. "Think what you will, the bargain stands. Your life for Tariya."
87    He looked at her, his eyes full of pain. His voice was almost pleading. "But I love her."
88    She snorted. "Love! What do you know of love?" She continued, "You're young. And soultappers have incredibly long
89 lifespans, should they survive their adventures. Thousands of years. Leaving now will be very hard but you will be
90 surprised at how quickly the wound heals. The galaxy is full of young, beautiful girls. Take the oath, and go find
91 yourself a new life elsewhere. If you don't," Her face darkened, "You will die. The cancer is burning through your
92 blood even as we speak. You can feel it. Your power will no longer hold it back at all. Without the gem, you will have
93 no more than six weeks."
94    Six weeks. The words fell on him like the thud of a tomb door. he stared at the cold, lifeless gem in his hand.
95 Memories played through his mind. His meeting tariya at the Inn. Her offering of her life to escape the dimensional
96 prison. Waking up in a stasis coffin to find her warm, smiling face looking down at him. Her dying (he thought)
97 declaration of love for him.
98    He had no other chance. The gem was one-of-a-kind. He could search a thousand years for another. But he only had
99 six weeks. It made perfect sence. With a potential lifespan of millenia, he could go anywhere, do anything he wanted.
100 Despite all the problems he had, he enjoyed his life as the Destroyer immensely. So much potential was left, just
101 waiting to be touched. He didn't want to die yet. And he didn't have to. All he had to do was betray Tariya. When it
102 came right down to it, the choice was very simple, as most choices are.
103    He closed his hand on the gem and made a fist. He squeezed as hard as he could, the cords in his wrist standing
104 out. There was a muffled crunch in his fist. When he opened it up a shower of glittering shards fell to the floor.
105 When he looked up again his face was full of fierce, cold determination.
106    "I'll be back."
107    Without another word, he turned and walked out of the shattered chamber. She didn't bother to follow. Instead, she
108 just stood there, staring at the pile of shards.
109    He gave it up. He was gambling that he would find another cure before his time ran out. If he did...
110    God help her.
111    She felt a sudden chill in the air and shuddered a little. She told herself firmly that he had thrown away his
112 chance. He had already been looking for two years with no success. Now he was right back where he started. Worse than
113 when he started. In six weeks, she wouldn't have to worry about him any more.
114    Not that she had time to worry now. She had a planet to rebuild and a brand new empire to take charge of. It
115 wouldn't be easy, she knew, but she could do it. She had spent years planning just how.
116    She put the Destroyer out of her thoughts and instead put her mind to the task at hand.

145 freddy: Your analogy of the people pushing the boulder isn't quite accurate.
146 We don't all push simultaneously.  One person pushes it this way, then someone
147 else takes his turn and pushes it that way.  Sometimes the stories go 'round
148 in circles, but more often the stories meander their way towards the group goal.
149 +++++++++
150 "Look!  Look at Piper!"
151 Somehow Milchar found himself saying these words.  They hadn't been pushed out
152 of his mouth in the mundane manner, but rather leaped out of their own accord.
153 Piper reached out a hand.  "Milchar -- how?  Cragmore?  Innkeeper!  His lungs
154 must be nearly eaten away by the gas!"
155 Just then the relief was so intense I nearly did not hear him.  Cragmore tried
156 to explain the situation to him and apologize to the rest of the group at the
157 same time.  Milchar nodded to him and told him it was not necessary to
158 apologize for an opinion.
159 Piper seemed to be breathing without much trouble.  Milchar smiled with the
160 
161 satisfaction of a job well done, and again lay his head down.  He listened to
162 the others as they talked, and replied as he had to.  It was time to begin
163 the restoration of his poewer.

168 CISTOP: I took another look at the Archive files with the problems, and what I
169 found is rather interesting (*I* think).  With the exception of the first two
170 flakey files, the problems in all the others ALL occur on a certain marker
171 consisting of ->128<- backslashes.  When the 128 character line of "\\\"'s
172 occur, the following line is appended to it.  No room in your I/O buffer for
173 the CR/LF when the entire sector is full of slashes?  
174 The problem with the other two files (30Dec85 & 09Jan86) also has to do with
175 long lines, but They didn't happen to be the backslashes.  An example:
176 247 The secretary of Defense, a man known for being cool under fire, eased into
177 the conversation.  The President had great respect f248 and he listened, as did
178 every man in the room.  All eyes were riveted on the gentle features of this 
179 great negotiator as the man 249 "First I will summarize "...
180 
181 What it boils down to, I think, is that MA 128 causes problems for more than
182 just FA & FI.  I was able to fix the \\\\ entries by hand, since no data was
183 lost, but the entry above (from 30DEC85) seems to have lost some words, as
184 did 09JAN86.  I sure hope your CP/M version is intact if your MS-DOS isn't.

191    Frank slowly picked himself up off the floor. Battery powered backup lights were beginning to flicker on. The air
192 was filled with the sharp stink of ozone and melted plastic and metal. Though his voice made his head hurt even worse,
193 he yelled out, "Hey! Somebody speak to me! Is everyone all right?"
194    Norbert groaned, "Not me. Feels like they nuked my cerebellum."
195    "You and me both. Jean! Doug! Say something!" he called down into the semidarkness.
196    "Something." Doug called back, giggling a little.
197    "We're... all right." Jean said slowly. She shook her head, trying to clear it. The fog was slowly lifting. "If I
198 knew what one felt like, I could say whether or not we just experienced a psychic feedback."
199    "It was a trip, I can say that." Norbert commented, still a little groggy. He looked over his instruments. "Crap!
200 Everything's burned out. I got no power anywhere."
201    "I could have told you that just from smelling the air." Frank replied. He tried the backups but they were dead,
202 too. So was the ventilation. "Jean? Since you're next to the door, would you care to prop it open so we don't
203 suffocate? By the way, what's a psychic feedback? Never heard of it."
204    Norbert suddenly gasped, "Holy sh- Look!" and pointed to the back of the lab.
205    The materialization platform was hidden from direct view by the lead shielding but the fading glow being reflected
206 off the walls and ceiling behind it told them something was happening. Cautiously, the four got up and approached it.
207 Doug kept to the back, a knowing smile on his face.
208    "Stay here." Frank said, as he went around the shield. He appeared a second later, holding a large object in his
209 hands. It was a statue of a nude woman, about three feet high, and formed in such perfect detail that it could not have
210 been made by human hands. The most amazing thing about it was that it appeared to be made of solid gold. Jean saw from
211 the way Frank's muscles were standing out that it must have been heavy. She hoped he didn't hurt himself.
212    Frank set it down on its base with a grunt. "I got into this field to get away from hard work. Could that be real
213 gold?"
214    "I thought we were trying for a cylinder." Jean said.
215    "Sorry." Doug said. His eyes were fixed on the statue. He went over to admire it closer. He ran his hands over its
216 smooth curves. "It's beautiful, isn't it?"
217    "Yes it is." Frank assured him. "Jesus! Solid gold? How the hell did we do that? It must be worth a fortune!"
218    "Yeah," Norbert said, "probably about one-fifth the cost of the equipment we blew up. Not a very profitable scheme.
219 'sides, considering all the variables that we couldn't control, more likely it's an alloy that looks and weighs close
220 to gold." He leaned closer for a better look. "The detail's fantastic, though. You can even see the hairs on her-"
221    "Norbert!" Jean said warningly.
222    "Oh. Uh, sorry." He blushed bright red and busied himself checking damage.
223    "Anyway," Frank said, "We'll have to get a sample upstairs to the matallurgy boys for analysis and identification.
224 Then we'll know for sure. We can probably take some off the base-"
225    "NO!" Doug screamed. He threw his arms around the statue protectively. "Don't damage it! You can't!" He looked
226 pleadingly at Jean, "Miss Lambert! Please don'T let them hurt it! Please!"
227    Startled by the vehemence of Doug's reaction, Jean hastily reassured him. "Don't worry, Douglas. I won't let them.
228 Calm down." Frank looked at her in disbelief and she took his arm and led him to the back of the room. Speaking softly
229 so Doug couldn't hear her, she said, "Tell me, doesn't that statue look familiar?"
230    Frank replied, "Well, I can't say I recognize the body, but I think I know the face. That's his ex-wife, isn't it?"
231    "Exactly. It's obvously an idealized image of her and he can't bear the thought of it being damaged. I think we
232 should humor him on this, at least until later. There's no rush. Maybe I can convince him to-"
233    Suddenly the lab door slammed open. Standing there, panting, was Dudley Wilson, one of the computer nerds from
234 upstairs. He was frantic about something. "I... out there... the mountain..." he puffed incoherently.
235    Norbert grabbed him by the shoulders and said, "Calm down, guy! Calm down. What about what mountain?"
236    Dudley regained his composure a little. "It's-it's gone! Mount Hood just vanished into thin air!"

243 About that new 36 line BBS system called the M.U.X. SYSTEM.... Does anyone
244 know what "terminal type" it requires? I did try to get on the system with
245 an Apple using my "Pro-Ez" comm. software, but M.U.X said "incompatible
246 terminal" and disconnected me. I'm very new at telecomputing and don't
247 understand....

249 *******************************************************************
250 Voyeur: Your deductions are close to the mark, I've been going through the
251 archive disks, and discovered as you did that the lines that are 128 long
252 have the problem associated with them. Luckily I happen to have the 30Dec85
253 BW disk still intact, and looked through it with a disk utility program.
254 Surprise, the archive disk *is* a carbon copy of the BW disk. It seems that
255 when the line is exactly 128 characters long that no carriage return is put
256 on the disk. (The CR is how the system knows it is at the end of the line
257 in the given sector.) But since a 128 character line fills the entire sector
258 there is no need for a CR right? Sooooo.... now the transfer utility adds in
259 the various pieces of information that are not a part of the disk, such as
260 line numbers and the tag line indicating how many lines are in the file.
261 It looks for a CR in each sector, and uses that to determine that it
262 has reached the end of the current line, and throws away the rest of the
263 sector. Then it adds a LF to the end, and go gets the next sector. But,
264 if it doesn't see a CR, it can't transfer it to the file, nor of course add
265 the LF. So, what you see in those files is an exact copy of what was on the
266 BW disk. No CRs. 
267      So how come nobody complained about this before? I'm sure there have
268 been other 128 line entries in the past. Hmmm strange. Anyhow, the transfer 
269 utility has been fixed, and it nows adds the proper CR/LF even if there is none.
270 So, don't worry about the lost data, there wasn't any. Apparently the lines
271 in question were the result of someones upload that wasn't paying attenion
272 to the line lengths on BW, and tried to send 132 character lines or somthing.
273 So the lost characters have always been lost, because they never got onto 
274 BW in the first place. 
275      The end result to all of this is, put a CR/LF at the appropriate place
276 in the file, and you're alright.
277 ********************************* CISTOP MIKEY ******************************
278 Mikey- you are right about the above. The entry that mentions the Secretary of State was uploaded, and I made the lines 
279 long. I set the margin at 120, but went ovet that in several lines, so nothing was lost. It just never got on. Sorry for
280 the inconvenience, I'll watch this next time. [*=*] DELTA FIVE [*=*]
281 L'homme: will Super Utility read DS disks? If so, we may be able to save
282 some space in the xfers. (Assuming I get that DS drive hooked up soon!)
283 I'm as long as your using a format that I have to use SU on anyway....

364 appeared out of nowhere while Straxi had been tending xihis Maniquart herd.  They
365 couldn't breath chlorine, but as to how they had solved that problem Straxi was
366 uncertain.  Straxi rushed back to his home and returned with a translator,
367 hoping he could make contact with |hthe creatures, who didn't speak common
368 H'ran.  Straxh turned the dial on his teleporter belt to match the location
369 f t bo
370 of the alien's`ship.  He felt the tug of the teleportation.  As he entered the
371 ship, he gagged on the strange air within.  Quickly, he put on his status
372 helmet, which brought on the refreshing air of his homeworld.  BSuddenly he 
373 realized that all eyes were o~ n him.  How foolish he had been.  If he thought 
374 that these creatures wdreere alien, then they couldn't help but feel the same way
375 about him.  His three fingers fumbled across the controls of the translator,
376 as the device scanned the aliens , trying to find the correct frequency.  WHhile
377 his first two hands were occupied with txhat task, the other two were adjusting
378 the helmet he wore over his small, turtle tlike head.
379      Straxi finally found the correct frequency for his translator, and for
380 the first time, he spoke to the aliens.
381      "Hello.  I am Straxi,` of the planet H'an.  W-welcome. `W ho are you?"

492 RE: JD SILVERMAN/THE DESTROYER
493 BETWEEN THE TWO CHARACTERS OF THIS ONE WRITER (AND IS THERE ANYBODY STILL
494 DUMB ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THEY ARE TWO PEOPLE?) I BELIEVE HE IS TAKING AN 
495 UNFAIR AMOUNT OF SPACE ON THIS BOARD. HE IS RUNNING TWO STORIES WITH LINE 
496 COUNTS LONGER THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE PERSON ON THIS BOARD EVER USES. I KNOW
497 OF AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE QUIT READING THIS BOARD BECAUSE IT SEEMS 
498 TO HAVE DEDICATED ITSELF EXCLUSIVELY TO ONE WRITER. I THINK MAYBE YOU
499 SHOULD PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN AND TELL THIS PERSON TO SUSPEND EITHER ONE OR
500 ANOTHER OF HIS STORIES UNTIL THE OTHER IS FINISHED. AND HE SHOULD KEEP HIS
501 LINE COUNT DOWN TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OR RISK DELETION. I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS
502 AND KNOW AS WELL THAT A *LOT* OF OTHERS WOULD APPRECIATE IT AS WELL. OR 
503 MAYBE THIS REALLY HAS BECOME THE JD SILVERMAN/DESTROYER PERSONAL USE BOARD?

508 Monsieur De Guerre; A few points, if I may.
509     This IS a system free to its users.  Whatever ideals you have that
510 you feel compelled to install on others is not universal amoung the
511 readers here.  Although due to the free nature, you may, and have,
512 posted your views.
513     Since you show yourself to be so knowledgable of the user in
514 question, would not your comments be best held in conversations
515 strictly between yourself and your, well, associate user?
516     Debates between calm and rational parpicipants have always been
517 welcomed here on BWMS.  In fact, they were at one point the life of
518 this system.  I've heard it said that we haven't had a good debate in
519 years...  Well, a year at least.
520     Name calling and hate-mail also have had their place.  For what
521 good, I don't know.  But what I've been seeing here these last two
522 months is a display of contempt, venemous at times.  I don't care for
523 it much, if at all.
524     This is a billboard for writers, and I shall read whatever is
525 posted here for others to read.  I make my own selections.  It just so
526 happens that I am one of the few that continues to read The Destroyer
527 series.
528     Seeing as there are users with the attention span of only one
529 screenful, and I have stated my views, I shall depart.
530                                         Nom De Sant

533   Hello Mark,
534     I thought that might be you still lurking on this system.  I, on
535   the other hand, have not been here for quite some time.  
536     You can't seriously be thinking of replacing the faithful ASCII
537   Express?  I would be like killing an old friend.  You should be
538   well adjusted to its shortcomings by now.
539     Lastly, how much would you like to wager that Alan is also here?
540   He can change  his identity, but he can't hide his total lack of
541   social grace ( or his lousy sense of humor ).  
542                       Try to overlook the typos...
543                            You know who.
544 [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]
545 In case anyone is wondering, Nom De Sant is an "old and respected" user.
546 He did not pick that name to bug "Nom de Guerre". 
547 I don't know if JD Silverman is "the Destroyer" or not, but he isn't 
548 taking up *that* much space... in fact if you removed both storylines, it'd
549 take close to a month to fill a disk at the current rate. Others have used 
550 similar amounts of space on a semi-regular basis... BARD for instance.
551 I have no objections and in fact I'd still have no objections even if I
552 *didn't* like his/their stuff. There's alway the DO 10 command...

561 Mikey: I might as well chalk off this week too as far as visiting USD is concerned. The tug between Clyde and Chuck is
562 starting to have adverse physical and psychological effects. I'll try to make it out soon, because I would like to
563 see the 808x emulator on the ST, and I would like to try the AdventureWare programs on a disk that doesn't have
564 the desk accessories as you spoke of. If it does free up additional memory, then I should be able to place the
565 introduction subroutines back in the main program. The chain technique just doesn't make it when the source code
566 is in ASCII. No word on Chuck's purchase
567 of an Emulator, and, I have not been able to reproduce the error in READCPM. Chuck doesn't want it on either of
568 his hard disks, so perhaps we'll never find out what really happened. (de da de dum de da de dum)
569 How is the address change going? New versions? ARG! On the archives, contrary to what that voyeur character says,
570 SOME people do read the disks, and discovered the line length problem long ago, and fixed the lines in question by
571 adding a cr/lf at the end. I'm glad to see the confusion this time was merely due to an over-abundance of 128 character
572 lines due mainly to borders and faulty uploads. Everything looks fine after editng. Got it voyeur??? :-) Hey, I had to 
573 get a small dig in, now that you're street legal and everything! :-) BEWARE TROJAN HORSES.
574 Leonard : No luck on the disk yet, will report findings later. Are you sure you didn't plug this in to 110VAC by
575 mistake?

579     The stories entered by Jon Silverman are long.  Regard less of the waste in
580 space, or the good use in space, the stories take a good portion of the reading
581 time on this system.  It is more the waste, or good use, of time that bothers
582 everyone than the wasted space.  Though some fanatical archivists might wring
583 their hands at the space taken up in their libraries of disks.
584     On the Blue Parrot at least, it is possible to skip an entry.  A fair part
585 of the user list on that system, does skip them.  This system is different.  I
586 am not implying worse, only different.  What is written here is to read and
587 everyone gets his moment in the spotlight.  A point which makes debates here a
588 good deal better than on any other system around.
589     The point I am trying to make, is that Jon Silverman and other lengthy
590 bibliophiles ought to take into consideration the time span they are imposing
591 on the rest of us.  Rather than entering their things here, they might enter
592 them in a place with a skipping feature.  They might enter them on a system of
593 their own devising.  Or heavens to Betsy, they might leave them where they got
594 them, from a book, or on Compuserve.
595     Mister Silverman, will you please limit yourself to the most interesting
596 of your stories on this system, and send the rest to other systems with skip?
