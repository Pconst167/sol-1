25 A VIRGIN DISK!  I CAN'T STAND IT.  TAKE THAT. AND THAT!!!!
26 Help!   Did somebody move Neptune and Pluto ?  I keep THINKING I hear
27 Neptune labeled as the most distant of our solar system.  Just when
28 did they, and who is they, change things?   Dave
29 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
30 Neptune has been the farthest out planet for some time. Pluto has a very
31 eccentric orbit, and for the next 30 or so years will be inside the
32 orbit of Neptune. Pluto has, in fact, such a strange orbit, and is so
33 small, that it is often believed to be an escaped moon of neptune (or
34 something, who knows at 4.6 bilion miles.)
35 It's cold out there! About 5K or so. (That K is 'Kelvin', or degrees above
36 absolute zero, not 1024) BRRRR. Well, since this is summer, maybe a
37 little warmer, maybe 6K. That's hot. Pant, pant.
38 .................................................ouch................
39 To fit in with the ongoing argument about what our language is, and means,
40 please note that there is no such thing as "Kelvin degrees"; the correct
41 term is "Kelvin" (only).
42 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,B.A.D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43 I HOPE YOU ARE ALL AS GLAD AS I AM, THAT ITS FRIDAY.
44 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
45 If those are the Neptunal facts, I thank you, ouch.  I wonder if all of
46 my 5th grade science learnin' is subject to other eccentricities!  If this
47 orbit had shown up way back when, would Mickey's dog have been Neptune?

49 GOT SKIPPED TIL I FINALLY LOOKED AT THR SCREEN AND REALIZED THE
50 DISK WAS FULL.WAS INTERESTED IN THE STATEMENTS MADE BY A FEW ABOUT
51 CROSSING THEIR LEGS-THIS IS SOMETHING MANY PEOPLE DO AND I HAVEN`T
52 EXPERIENCED TO MANY PROBLEMS WHEN IN THIS SPOT-I DON`T RELATE IT
53 TO ANYTHING, BUT I CAN RELATE TO CRYING IN SITUATIONS THAT REALLY
54 EFFECT ME AND I CRY SOMETIMES-I'VE SEEN IT BOTHER PEOPLE BUT ALL
55 I CAN SAY IS THAT IT'S A HUMAN CONDITION TOO MANY WANT TO PUSH A
56 SIDE-I'VE GROWN SO MUCH BY BEING HUMAN-ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE MACHO
57 TO FEEL AND REACT----IT'S HUMAN NATURE WITH NO HOLDS...............

60    It is socially acceptable for man AND women to cross their legs, as 
61 long as it is done correctly.  Women cross their legs by resting one knee 
62 on the other. (The inside of one knee touching the top of the other). Men 
63 cross their legs by resting the side of the shin on the other thigh.
64    Although these are not as much hard-set rules as txey used  be, many 
65 people still consider it offensively feminine for a man to cross his legs 
66 wrong. Txese are the same people who somehow relate how a woman crosses 
67 her legs with her sexual promiscuity.
68    Even though people are getting more reasonable about allowing men to 
69 be human, crying is still a general no-no.  It's almost never you'll see a
70 "man" crying in public.
71 
72 
73    I think the eccentricity of Pluto's orbit is about equal to the 
74 eccentricity of some of my friends.
75    Actually, there was a serious scientific paper written on pluto that 
76 suggested it was an intergalactic transportation device left by a 
77 superior race (the Russians?)!
78 The paper stood valid for over a decade, until someone finally(!) found 
79 it's fault!
80   It seems the paper was based on the fact that mass readings of Pluto 
81 showed it being 55 times the weight of water. That's only possible if the 
82 thing was a neutron star or a blackhole.
83    Note: the densest known material, osmium, is only 22 times the weight 
84 of water.
85    Well, they later found that pluto had a moon, and THAT was where the e
86 extra weight came from. Recent calculations of mass show pluto to be 1.5 
87 times the weight of water. (As for comparison, txe Earth is 5.5 times.)

102 DEAR TRON-I AM THE AMAZON THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. I AM 6 FT TALL AND 
103 VERY STRONG. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. MY NAME IS SABRA AND
104 MEANS "THE BEAUTIFUL ONE" OR "BORN OF THE LAND". SABRA IS ISRALIAN
105 AND THERE IS A GROUP OF WOMEN NAMED "SABRAS" THEY GO AROUND KILLING
106 16 YEAR OLD COMMPUTER OPERATORS.
107      WHAT TYPE OF SOFTWARE DO YOU PRODUCE? I AM REALLY INTERESTED
108 IN COMMPUTERS. COULD YOU TELL ME SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR
109 SOFTWARE. COULD YOU GIVE ME YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER? PLEASE?
110      SO WHAT IS IT LIKE AT CORBETT HIGH SCHOOL? I USED TO GO TO 
111 WILSON HIGH BUT I AM MOVING TO CALIFORNIA. 
112      I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION, DOES YOUR SOFTWARE TURN INTO

119 To: Sabra the Amazon  From: Tron   Re: Software
120    Sorry, those women can't come around killing me because I
121 am 14. Wouldn't it be against their religon or something?
122    I design and write software for ALL TRS-80 Computers. I
123 own a Model I with 48k, Level II 3 cassette recorders and a
124 direct connect modem I. I am mainly interested in timesharing
125 mainframes such as UNIX. I am currently writing a UNIX simulator
126 at the moment. It has a basic interpreter built into it and
127 it is about the most pitiful thing you ever did see! Man it's slow!
128   Also, do I know you? and why are you interested in what kind
129 of software I produce? I'm not trying to be sarcastic or anything
130 but I am truly curious. Corbett High School is so old that the
131 thing is about to fall apart. You pull a staple out of the wall
132 and the wall falls over. See how cheap they are? It has survived
133 through 4 arsonizings and smells like the city sewer. I'd much
134 rather go back to Parkrose or Columbia High. By the way, my phone
135 number is 695-5762. Why do you want it? Again, I'm just curious.
136 
137                 Tron
138 P.S. What kind of terminal are you using?
139 ----------
140 DEAR TRON,
141      I AM USING A SIEGLER TERMINAL AND A TEKRONIX 4931 PHONE MODEM.  
142 NO I DO NOT KNOW YOU, SOME FRIENDS WERE TELLING ME ABOUT YOUR SOFTWARE,
143 I WAS ALSO JUST CURIOUS. LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT MYSELF, I AM 16.
144 6FT TALL, 165 POUNDS, BUT NO FAT ON THIS BODY. I LIKE COMPUTERS, HORSE-
145 BACK RIDING, SOFTBALL, SWIMMING, AND HORSERACING. I HAVE BLUE EYES, BROWN
146 HAIR,MEDIUM LENGTH,FRECKLES, AND LONG LEGS. WHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU LIKE?
147 I LIKE JUDAS PREIST, VAN HALEN, SCORPIONS, IRON MADIEN, DEF LEPPARD, AND
148 DAVID BOWIE. JUST BEING CURIOUS. 
149      TELL ME WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMS YOU HAVE PRODUCED. I HAVE NEVER 
150 PROGRAMED A COMPUTER BEFORE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN.  BY THE WAY WHAT
151 IS YOUR REAL NAME? MINE AS I SAID IS SABRA. IT WAS ON MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE,
152 I GUESS MY MOM WAS STILL DELIRIOUS FROM THE ANISTESIA WHEN SHE NAMED ME.
153      I DONT MEAN TO SOUND LIKE AN AMETUER BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU SEEM TO
154 BE SO (THIS IS HOW THEY SAY IT IN FLORIDA) BUFFED. IF YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR
155 STUFF GIVE ME A SIGN. 
156                            SINCERLY,
157                              SABRA, THE AMAZON.

159 
160      P.S. DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
161 P.S.S. THE AMAZONS ARE FIERCE WARRIORS WHO HAVE USED MEN AS SLAVES FOR
162 A LONG TIME. AND IF THE MEN DISOBEYED THEM THEY WERE KILLED. OBVIOSLY
163 KILLING IS NOT AGAINST THEIR RELIGION. BUT THAT IS THE WAY IT GOES.
164 HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE SITUATION? MYSELF I ESPECT MY MEN TO 
165 BE OBEDINT.I LOVE TO EXPERIMINT. AND NO GAMES INTENDED.
166 TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN, MY NAME IS SABRA THE AMAZON, AND I WOULD LIKE
167 TO CONVERSE WITH SOMEONE. JUST FOR THE SAKE OF CONVERSING. I AM WILLING
168 TO TALK TO ANYONE WHO IS WILLING TO TALK TO ME.

175 To: Sabra The Amazon  From: Tron  Re: Me
176 
177     No, I don't have a girlfriend at the moment. I like just
178 a little hard rock. I used to like Judas Priest but got sick
179 of them because KGON crammed their songs. I do like Def Leopard
180 and the Scorpions. Their music has something special in them.
181 Don't ask me what but they just do. I listen to KMJK. The only
182 reason I do is that their songs they play are good. I do like
183 (don't laugh) Devo, Rush, Flock of Seagulls, Men At Work, and
184 Journey. I don'T care for real hard rock but I like much more
185 mellower kind of music. I pick my songs VERY carefully. Have
186 you heard the song called "CARS" by Gary Numan? It's pretty
187 good I think. My real name is Chris Bradley. By the way, who
188 told you about my programming and stuff? I have programmed an
189 adventure called simply "CRIME ADVENTURE". I sold it for $350
190 bucks. I also have made a machine language game called "PESKY".
191 Tell me, are you using you're own terminal or someone elses?
192 Your name is very original. I had a friend named SODAPOP. I
193 admire people with interesting names. One of my main specialties
194 are machine language games. My music is selected by sounds
195 and intriging lyrics. One thing I like about DEVO is their entire
196 music (except drums) is taken up by Synthesizers. My interests
197 include Horses, Snow skiing, Swimming, Skating (roller) and
198 Biking. I am 5'6" tall and weigh 125 pounds. I have Brownish-
199 Blonde hair with eyes that have a combonation of Grey, Blue
200 and Green. I also like Video Games. Here are my favorites:
201 Tron, Donkey Kong, Galaga, Zaxxon (my favorite), Joust, Xevious
202 and Burger Time. Where do you live? What grade are you in?
203 My software is entirely devoted to interest to the users. By
204 the way, I play a number of insturments. I play Piano, Drums,
205 Guitar, Violin and A little Trumpet. Tell me more about yourself.

210 P.S. I respect others religon and don't try to stop them or make
211 any arguments about what they and I believe. I don't talk about
212 religion because you might get into fights or big arguments.
213 I keep most of my opinions to myself but sometimes some of them
214 slip out. I must respect the way the Ladies treat the Men in
215 the Amozonian countries. I live MUCH differently thatn that. I
216 must say that if a couple comes together, none of them rules.
217 They are in this marriage for togetherness and I don't think
218 that Men should rule Women and Vice Versa.

223 Sabra, you were just kidding about the Amazons going around
224 killing 16-year olds using computers, weren't you?
225 By the way, you could say that I know my stuff when I am talking
226 about computer. 5 years working with every micro I ever seen
227 is pretty good. I got my computer when I was 9. I am also very
228 strong. I can lift 2000 pounds (yes, 2000 pounds) with my legs
229 and can lift 200 with my arms. I also have an I.Q. of 157. Pretty
230 good huh?

249 OK Sabra, someone else to talk to has finally
250 logged on to this silly system.  I'm a 19 year
251 old male, 5'11, 175, blue eyes, light brown
252 hair, programmer/hardware specialist extraordinaire,
253 long-distance runner, cycler, pilot, and keyboard
254 musician.  Went to Cleveland High '82, now I'm
255 at U of Washington in Seattle.  Home for the
256 summer, I'm working at Radio Shack on SE Woodstock.
257 	I have a 48K model I TRS-80 with one (only
258 one!) disk drive, a LYNX modem, and lotsa neat
259 home-made add-ons.  I know many programming
260 languages, like BASIC, Pascal, C, FORTRAN, LISP,
261 and various assembly languages.

297 P.S. I also own a TRS-80 Model I with 48k without a disk drive.
298 I don't believe this! I leave the system for just a few days and I come back
299 and read about some immature 14 year old kid who lies 80% of the time talking
300 to some strange 16 year old who weighs 165 lbs and says none of it is fat!
301 Then some 19 year old(you would think by that age they would know better)
302 gets on and puts his physical attributes and even a phone number! Jeeze
303 what is the world coming too? Is it to be taken over by lie through your teeth
304 munchkins who are about as computer literate as some of the primates
305 at the oregon health science center? Please let us return this BBS to the
306 insanity that graced its magnetic media before all these youngters starting
307 logging on and messing with the traditional values of BWMS. Why doesn't some
308 one invent a hardware device that will restrict entry to those only
309 over the age of 21. That would get rid of most of the riffraff.
310 And would someone tell these kids to take their acne cream and get off the
311 system!?!

369 Andy,
370   Do you have a C compiler? If so, does it need disk? Do you
371 have a compiler or interpreter for the TRS-80 Model I without
372 disks? I have the new version of the Editor/Assembler. I also
373 have a LOT of games. About 700 of them to be exact. My software
374 library is FILLED with anything from space wars to bookeeping
375 programs. I have SCRIPSIT, SUPER NOVA, ROBOT ATTACk (it talks
376 without a voice synthesizer), Galaxy INVASION, and may others.
377 To list them all would fill up 100 of mikeys_disks. I'm mainly
378 interested in other languages. I'll be sure to give you a call.
379 By the way, I'm 14 and live in Corbett. I'll be a freshman this

385 Tron, the C compiler I use is part of Reed College's UNIX
386 system.  The Editor/Assembler I use came with my NEWDOS80
387 and is the standard Radio Shack program with disk I/O and
388 a few other goodies.  I guess I can't beat you in the games
389 department, I've only got a few, but ROBOT ATTACK, GALAXY
390 INVASION, ARMORED PATROL, COSMIC FIGHTER, ATTACK FORCE,
391 and SUPER NOVA are among them.  (Love those Big Five games!)
392 	     Have you visited Blackjack Fireworks yet?  Amazing
393 place, that.  They won't let Washington residents in until
394 June 28th.  They have bags of 40 M-80's (no, not Z-80's!)
395 for $18.  A gross of bottle rockets: $6.  Brick of 2000
396 Black Cat firecrackers: $20.  Not bad stuff!  I just

411 Do you have a subscription to 80-MICRO? If not, I could probably
412 lend you some issues so you could get some programs and utilites
413 out of them. By the way, what kind of modem do you have? Do you
414 have BEDLAM, RAAKA-TU or PYRAMID? If not, maybe we could trade
415 those. Also I have about 30 issues of CLOAD magazine. I have
416 also written a tape I/O system that increases tape speed to
417 1800 baud. No kidding, 1800 baud without hardware modification
418 unless you have that XRX mod installed. When you power up, does
419 your computer say "MEMORY SIZE? _" or "MEM SIZE? _"? The tape
420 I/O only works with the "MEM SIZE" version. Well, I'll call ya
421 later.

426 Tron, I have a subscription to 80-MICRO and one of these
427 days I'm gonna go through all my back issues and enter all
428 those neat programs and utilities I've been meaning to get...
429 I have BEDLAM on cassette somewhere, and PYRAMID too.
430 RAAKA-TU I don't have.  And, my Trash is about four years
431 old, so it says "MEMORY SIZE? _".  How come the tape I/O
432 only works with the new version?  I know the ROM calls are
433 different, but not that much... are they?  I haven't used
434 my tape in a long time.  (ahh... memories!  (4116's?)

436 PS:  I'm working tonight at Clackamas Town Center, back
437 around 9:30 or so if ya wanna call.
438 Oh yeah.  I have a LYNX direct-connect 300-baud modem,
439 with an autodialer I added.  Oh yeah again:  I thought of
440 writing a tape-copying utility that will copy ANYTHING,
441 even "protected" tapes.  It's ridiculously easy...
442 anyway, when a tape error is encountered, instead of the
443 usual "C*" in the corner of the screen, it says:
444 	TAPE ERROR:  BUY A DISK, DUMMY!

446 To: Andy   From: Tron   Re: My terminal program
447 
448    My terminal program consists of an Uploader/Downloader save
449 to tape/retrieve to tape. It uses the SWTYM system. It also
450 allows you to press <BREAK> key when you are waiting for another
451 byte to come in from tape. It's a homebrew terminal program
452 and I intend to sell it to 80-MICRO. The reason I wrote my own
453 is that I didn't want to pay $60 for a program that would
454 operate my modem and secondly,  my friends told me to wait and
455 get a disk. In effect, I totally disobeyd them. What kind of
456 disk drive do you have? How much did you pay for a plain old
457 set of 16k memories (4116's)? Could you call me instead? I kind
458 of feel weird calling new people and am afraid to call people
459 at late hours. Just trying not to make enemies. Why don't you
460 call me anytime between 10:00am and 8:30pm. My phone number
461 is 695-xxxx. Also, my name is Chris Bradley. Talk to ya!
462 
463                Tron
465 P.S. Call 245-xxxx with your computer. When the computer gives
466 you a carrier detect, press <ENTER> until you get a response.
467 Let's talk on that line instead.

493    Andy,
494      I also have DEFENSE COMMAND. Do you have ELIMINATOR or
495 PENETRATOR? Also, you mentioned something about wanting to make
496 a program that copies "uncopiable programs"? I am EXTREMELY
497 farmiliar with the TRS-80 Model I's tape I/O system. MY MISTAKE!
498 I GOOFED! Yes, my terminal program DOES work with the old TRS-80's
499 tape I/O. That's funny, I got my computer 5 years ago and I
500 get "MEM SIZE ?" instead. I also have rewritten my computer's
501 keyboard, video and tape drivers. I also like adding many more
502 commands than my computer likes. I have written TONS of utility
503 programs including a memory test that takes 10 hours; in machine
504 language. It pokes every value 0-255 into every single memory
505 location (not rom) twice. It thoroughly tests memory. If you
506 are interested in any of this stuff, give me a call from 10:00am
507 to 8:30pm at 695-xxxx. Thanks......

512 Tron,
513 	   Got back late from work, so didn't have time to call.
514 Tomorrow I'm off, so I'll call 245-xxxx at, say, 11:00 or
515 so.  (morning.)
516   I don't have either DEFENSE COMMAND or ELIMINATOR.
517 PENETRATOR either, but I've glimpsed that one from over
518 a friend's shoulder, when I can pull him far enough away
519 from the keyboard to see.  
520    You really sound like you know what you're doing
521 with these here computers.  I never really got into
522 tape routines that much becase I always thought I was
523 going to buy a disk system in a few weeks.  (it actually
524 took two years, but who's counting?)  I have ONE ss/sd
525 45-track five-inch drive (Tandon).  It's only supposed
526 to go 40 tracks, but I have a good data seperator in my
527 interface.  I heard some people saying they got their
528 drive heads to step farther in, so I tried it, and behold!
529 45 tracks, 10 more grans of storage.  (Hey, with one
530 single density disk, you need all the space you can get!)
531 If you want to mess with it, I'll load my host program
532 tomorrow and see what I can come up with.  Maybe I can send
533 you a copy of MEGATERM, my term program (unfinished yet,
534 no disk I/O, but it's getting there.  No RS232 config-
535 uration yet, either, but who needs that often?)

547 To: Mike Day     Fm: Adam Trent    Re: AMODEM
548 Hi Mike,  Continuing to find AMODEM very useful.  I thought I would
549 mention some problems I had with it in case you haven't heard of such
550 elsewhere--are you still looking for bugs?  Anyway I've used it with
551 no noticeable problems (as now) on 300 baud modems.  But then I tried
552 using it for transfer between a 2.5 MHz KAYPRO II and a 4MHz CCS 2200 
553 at 9600 baud.  When I first tried this at 19200 baud I experienced
554 problems.  I dropped the baud rate to 9600 and fixed my INITMOD routine
555 so it wasn't changing the baud on me (back to 300!).  I was doing a
556 quick one-shot transfer that day and after these fixes it worked for
557 the transfer.  Hadn't done any other 9600 straight RS232 transfers till
558 recently.  At which time nothing worked.  I know now that things worked
559 the first time because I had reset the CCS and re-entered AMODEM.  I
560 can transfer one file (BATCH off) if I reset the CCS and re-enter
561 AMODEM.  If I stay in AMODEM and try another file transfer (fm CCS to
562 KAYPRO), I get a variety of Errors, depending on whether I start the
563 receive or the send first.  Sorry, I didn't take good notes, but I
564 believe one such case was:
565   Slow Receiver:
566      FILE OPEN, READY TO RECEIVE
567      AWAITING #  XXX  *
568      and then "++ TIMEOUT ON ACK ++"
569    Fast Sender:
570      would show "++ TIMEOUT ON NAK ++"
571 Both AMODEMs would then cycle with these timeouts 10 times and return
572 to command prompt.  I hope I remember this right.  Anyway I started with
573 a shotgun approach based on a wild theory that the slow receiver (2.5Mhz)
574 was gobbling up the NAKs from the fast sender (4Mhz) and then trying to
575 receive the NAK it had just gobbled.  It's a strange kind of interlock
576 (deadly interlock as opposed to deadly embrace) that doesn't show up
577 if the two processor speeds are close to the same.  I reassembled 
578 AMODEM on the KAYPRO since I had the source there--I deleted 
579 "CALL GARBAGE" in the SENDFIL, GETNAK, GETACK, AND SENDNAK routines.
580 It works like greased lighting with the cosmetic deficit of apparently
581 2-bytes of garbage characters at the end of a send from XMODEM on the
582 Bv RCPM.  I should (but haven't yet) go back and find exactly which
583 CALL GARBAGE was the culprit.  Just wanted to pass this experience
584 on to you if you haven't encountered this before.  Hope it may help
585 you to make AMODEM even better.      21jun83  -  Adam Trent

589 To: Adam Trent    Fm: Mike Day 
590 Thanks for the info! Yes I can see the problem. No, I never heard of
591 it before you mentioned it. When I wrote the Garbage routine to fix
592 a problem in interrupt machines which buffer up lots of characters 
593 it was intended to clean them out. Thus I wrote the garbage routine
594 to collect data from the usart (or port) until the status went away.
595 It seems that if you are right on the edge though the status doesn't 
596 go away (if I read what you are saying correctly). hmm.. This could be
597 a bit tricky to fix.

599 I can't mix those pills with anything: they tast AWFUL!!!!! @$%^&*!!
600 If Sara gets even a trace on her tongue on the way down, its gag, spit,
601 barf, drool, yuck. One pill ruins a whole can of her favorite flavor.
602 Even Fang won't eat it, and he'll eat anything. I'll have to save a
603 couple of 'em to put on thing they chew on. I did clip her claws, though,
604 (only 4 fingers left to type with after last night.) Better than flash
605 bulbs, one rattle of the pill bottle and she's GONE.
