Note: You will notice a reversion to the old method of listing out the contents
of the disk in order to archive it. The reason for this is that I did not
archive it. It was done remotely by Leonard. The reason for this was because
on July 4th when this was archived, I was in the hospital. My method of 
archiving was variable for the next two months as I was not able to actively move around much having broken both heels in a climbing accident.

30 
31 Making his way through the oddly vacant halls of Talon headquarters, Baker Davison's concern over his impending 
32 confrontation with Dr. Omar Kantrell blossomed into a profound fit of nervousness.  Face-to-face meetings with 
33 Kantrell were extremely rare, and generally involved death, promotion, torture, or any combination of the three. 
34 
35      With a hiss, the huge doors to Kantrell's waiting room slid apart and a hot cloud of steam, which seemed to serve
36 no other purpose than to satisfy Kantrell's flare for the melodramatic, billowed from a concealed crack in the floor.

37 The waiting room was dark and ominous with solemn music droning in the background.  In appearance, miss Darkover, the
38 receptionist, was chosen as carefully as the rest of the room's decor.  Along with the extraordinary capabilities
39 owned by any agent working close to Kantrell, Darkover wore the look of a subtly erotic predatory animal.  Her bright
40 gray, almost feline eyes were set in a beautiful, yet stern face, framed by wavy, silken hair, black as obsidian, 
41 which ended on the front of her shoulders in a gentle curve that turned naturally and effortlessly into the rising
42 slopes of her breasts.  Her long legs, the left of which was exposed by a slit in the side of her form-fitting dress,
43 moved with the grace of a leopard, stalking its unwary prey.  The only interruption in Darkover's black and gray 
44 colors, and those of the entire room, was an emerald-green cameo suspended on a thin chain around her neck, resting
45 between her breasts, rhythmically rising and sinking with the pattern of her breathing.
46      The tiny whisper of green was Darkover's way of telling the world that, despite the symbiotic relationship she
47 maintained with the room, she would never be possessed by it.  The waiting room belonged to her, and everyone,
48 including Dr. Kantrell, would be wise to remember that.
49 
50      The visible security cameras scanning the room were but a tiny part of the elaborate defense system operating to
51 protect high ranking Talon personnel.  Davison was certain that one wrong move would bring a variety of bullets, laser
52 blasts, poison darts, gases, and who-knows-what-else to bear on his painfully mortal body.  The chair in which he was
53 sitting was no doubt laden with precise sensing devices to record his heart rate, respiration, brain-wave patterns,
54 pupil reactions, perspiration, and any number of other physiological functions.  The waiting period was part of the 
55 test.  Davison would have to come to grips with his fear, and with the realization that he was totally vulnerable.
56      Without receiving any apparent outside stimulus, as if responding to an internal clock, Darkover's stare left her
57 terminal and leveled on Davison.  "Dr. Kantrell will see you know."  Her voice  was grim, confident, and 
58 (not surprisingly) somewhat arousing.  On cue, and also without visible stimulus, the huge doors to the right of her
59 desk, leading to kantrell's office, began to open.  The heavy doors swung inward, very slowly, as if their tremendous 
60 bulk precluded rapid movement.  A mechanical hum filled the air, and the dark   music playing in the background struck
61 its final, most deathly chord.  In the back of Davison's mind was the vague notion that the waiting room was also a
62 conditioning chamber.  The deep colors and black music played his emotions, even his thoughts, the way a concert 
63 pianist plays a well-tuned Steinway.  But now the recital was over, and one does not keep Dr. Omar Kantrell waiting.
64 
65      The doors closed behind Davison with a slam harshly reminiscent of being   locked inside a prison cell.  Kantrell
66 sat facing a huge window behind his desk, which displayed a magnificent view of the Yukon Territory's snow-covered
67 mountains, so Davison saw only the back of his leader's chair.  The highest     ranking agents knew that Talon 
68 headquarters were located somewhere in the Yukon, but only kantrell knew exactly where.  Agents with permission (or
69 orders) to report to HQ were rendered unconscious and transported by a series of sea-planes, submarines, dog-sleds, 
70 and other forms of locomotion, many of which were piloted by remote control.    The routes were constantly changed,  
71 and always followed highly circuitous paths.  Of the people who originally built the complex, the ones who knew its
72 location were subsequently eliminated.  Most of the agents who worked at Talon  HQ were required to remain there for
73 the duration of their lives, a fact that made visits to the complex quite rare, and heightened Davison's apprehension
74 about the conversation in which he was about to partake.
75 
76      Finally, kantrell swiveled his chair and inspected Davison.  "I'll dispense with the formalities, Davison.  The
77 time has come for Talon to make its move.  As you know, after the fall of the   McKane empire, the rest of the 
78 underworld began vying for the top spot.  Talon has done quite well.  Our success is partly due to your Albanian 
79 operation."
80      Davison was rather proud of his success in Albania.  He had worked his way up through the ranks of an earmuff
81 company, and had become a trusted "member" of the McKane organization when the  collapse occurred.  Everyone knew that
82 the one who managed to pick up the pieces of the fallen giant would take command of the underworld.  Davison saved the
83 earmuff company and turned it into Talon's flagship corporation.  it was largely due to Davison thhat Talon had 
84 attained its prominent position. 
85      Kantrell continued, "one final push could give us the power we deserve.  We must overcome the Net."
86      "Sir," Davison worded his statement carefully, "I agree we must defeat Net, but they seem so...untouchable."
87      Sitting back in his chair, Kantrell took on the air of a venerable master, "there's one thing you'll learn, 
88 Davison.  Net is not an organization for good or for evil, but for its own advancement.  Such organizations are made
89 up of individuals, each seeking his or her own personal advancement.  They      deteriorate from within.  Something is
90 going on within Net.  Something very high up."
91      The description of Net alarmed Davison, who, against his better judgment,  decided to persue a dangerous point.
92 "Sir, isn't Talon such an organization?"
93      Kantrell's eyes widened and an accusing expression froze on his face.      Leaning forward in his seat, he spoke
94 in a slow, measured voice so as to make it very clear that he was deadly serious.  "The difference is that I am 
95 concerned with my own welfare.  And you, Davison, are also concerned with MY welfare.  Do you not agree?"  Kantrell's
96 gaze was locked, waiting for the obvious answer.
97      Davison dropped his mouth open, closed it, drew a deep breath, and answered in the only possible way.  "Of 
98 course, sir.  Your success is the success of the empire."  He suspected that a  Net agent might have answered his 
99 superiors in similar fashion.
100      Allowing his face to soften slightly, and easing back in his chair, Kantrell mercifully changed the subject.  He
101 pushed a button on his desk and a viewing screen came forth from the wall.  The screen lit up with a poorly resolved
102 picture, obviously taken with a high-powered telephoto, of a large man laying on an airport baggage claim.  "This man

103 resembles a high ranking Net official named Ian MacHinery.  The photograph is   much too grainy to allow for positive
104 identification, and we would have overlooked the body if it weren't for several other incidents, including this one-"
105      The screen showed a large man laying on the beach.  Kantrell continued,    "several people were trying to push 
106 him back into the ocean when someone noticed that he was a man.  Actually, he's an Ian MacHinery android.  It's in 
107 our custody and we're trying to probe its memory banks.  Unfortunately, it was  badly damaged and we're having 
108 problems figuring out the technology."
109      "We believe MacHinery has left the Net.  If we can get our hands on him, we can learn a great deal about the
110 organization.  Even a dead MacHinery could be in possession of valuable         documents.  I've sent Marcks and 
111 Ingles to Las Vegas to investigate the man on the baggage claim."
112      We've also been piecing together some other Net loose ends.  One of their agents used to own a highly advanced,
113 computerized automobile.  Some of its components had been incorporated into     various communication and military
114 satellites.  We have stolen those components, as well as some that were still on the earth, and have begun 
115 reconstruction of the car's computer banks.  Most of the components remain      unlocated, but we have managed to 
116 revive a small part of its memory circuits.  It gave us an address, which points to a Hilton hotel in Oklahoma City.
117 We don't know what it means, but it could be the most important investigation in Talon history."
118      Davison interjected, "or it could be the location of the Net agent's secret rendezvous with a prostitute."
119      "Possibly," Kantrell said, "that's for you to discover.  Your transportation to Oklahoma City has been arranged.
120 Good luck Davison.  Don't fail us...don't fail ME."
121      Again without apparent stimulus, the doors began to open.  Kantrell swung  around in his chair and faced the 
122 window.  In the distance, an ominous cloud bank engulfed a jagged mountain, and continued unfettered on its course.
123 A great storm was approaching.

132   "Holy sh*t Parity! What was that?" Popping sounds from HE detonation devices
133 concealed in CD/ROM cases had a way of making Fellows very nervous. The
134 usual flippant attitude of Net's class clown was plainly absent.
135   "Don't panic Fellows." Parity assured. "I won't blow us to kingdom come,
136 I hope." Parity cracked a smile. He had to in order to not lose his cool
137 completely. Like everything else NET produced, the CD/ROM case was a delicate
138 instrument, designed to exacting specifications, and constructed with quality
139 materials. There was no room for error, and both agents knew it.
140   "Hand me the Kershaw, Fellows. I need to pry this plate, and the blade
141 on that should be the right size." Fellows complied, and Parity continued
142 his disarming procedure.
143   "Parity? Mind if I talk?" Fellows wanted to alleviate some of the nervousness
144 both agents felt.
145   "Sure, it might help lessen the deafening silence in here. One must give the
146 Westward Ho credit. The walls are indeed think. We won't have to worry about
147 hurting anyone else should I goof."
148   "Parity, don't even kid about such things. Anyway, while you were getting the
149 tools out of the nap-sack, I looked over the credentials we found on, er, got
150 from Ian's body. Everything appears to be in order except one thing."
151   "What's that? His AAA card expired?"
152   "No, but in the wallet I found a piece of paper with an address on it."
153   "Fellows, you don't mean Ian went to a..."
154   "No, nothing like that. The address is for Cafe Gigi."
155   "Gigi? You mean Le haute-cuisine et premiere Palace de Versailles? Well, Ian
156 certainly had good tastes in restaurants. I didn't even know he liked the
157 movie Marie Antoinette."
158   "It surprises me too. But I also found a receipt for dinner. There's no way
159 to be sure it was his, but whoever ate there spent a pretty penny. Braised
160 fresh salmon in champagne and grapes, filet mignon, sauce bearnaise, roast
161 duckling in orange sauce, and bequed pork ribs. Total bill 235 dollars."
162   "Ian must have had a party, Fellows."
163   "I thought so too, until I saw the box marked 'guests.' It says 'one.' Ian,
164 or whoever, was there alone."
165   "And ate enough to gorge the LA Raiders' offensive line. I'm starting to get
166 a funny feeling, Fellows. Wait, <click>, there, the plate is off. Whoa, this
167 is new. Blast! Take a look at this, Fellows."
168   Fellows peered over Parity's shoulders into a morass of wiring and discrete

169 components. "They changed the circuit. It looks like Tempest mods. It's less
170 susceptible to EMF. One would think a nuclear blast would keep the person
171 carrying the CD/ROM case busy enough. Oh thorough NET we love you."
172   "Cut the comedy, Fellows. Hand me those wire clippers."
173   "Er, Parity, what's that sound?" Parity paused mid-motion. Immediately his
174 ears picked up on it. Just barely audible, a whirring sound emanated from the
175 case.
176   "Crapola, Fellows. Time delay fuse. Gotta get at the firing mechanism.
177 Clippers, now!"
178   Fellows saw Parity sweat for the first time since they had hung upside
179 down in the Dragon Room two years ago. There was a reason to sweat this
180 time too. Fellows remembered his training.

385 Friends betray you,
386 and turn their backs upon you.
387 God and Satan war in their eternal
388 battles,
389 and everything that happens there
390 makes our life worse.
391 It just goes to show: Life is a war,
392                       and war is hell!
393      Ce le Gar (sp?)
394 You BELIEVE the New York Times? Good
395 grief, that is only one newspaper. 
396 Some people hate God because he does not grant them their all of their personal
397 wishes and desires. Some people doubt 
398 his existance because of all the pain
399 misery and grief in this world. Well
400 folks, God suffers as we suffer because
401 most of our problems are brought upon
402 ourselves because of our own selfishness, hatred and greed. God wants to see
403 if we can solve our own problems withouthis constant intervention. It would be
404 easy to have faith if fantastic miracleshappened every day, but then that faith
405 would have no real value. Faith is
406 most valid when the only evidence of
407 God is in things that are not readily
408 apparent to the eye, but only to the
409 soul.

415         Silvermere gossip 3 (cont.)
416     the next few days were spent in travel for the group.  A few of their number had decided to stay behind and go on
417 their own, so the only ones going were Thalor Hansek, Angela Jax, Olorin, Panthim, and a new person in the group:  a k
418 named Kicks.
419     Finally, they arrived at the base of Mt. Carnage.  In front of them was a long, winding trail going around the mountain.
420 They continued to follow it, but about halfway up the mountain is where the map stopped.  It showed a door, but as they 
421 looked around, they saw nothing.  Angela, though, looked a bit closer and noticed the outlines of a door sunk into the
422 mountain beside the trail.  She looked
423 for a handle, but could find none.
424 Bewildered, she reported the find to the group.  Thalor walked up to the door.
425     "Hello."  Thalor jumped back in surprise as the voice sounded as if it had come from the door.  When no one answered,
426 the door continued.  "Fine then!  Be rude!  Ah well, I guess it's to be expected.  After all, what person ever expects a 
427 door to talk!"  A sigh came from the door and the rest of the group stood transfixed as a face appeared on the door.
428 It looked as if it were made of ice.  There was a beard, and eyes and a nose and all the other features of a face.  It 
429 looked them all over and sighed.
430     Thalor recovered from his shock and replied.  "Hello to you too!  How do you, I mean, as a door, uh..  how do you talk?"
431     "Well, long ago, I was a human like you, but then my creator captured me in a battle and sentenced me to an eternity
432 of guarding this damn doorway!"  It looked sheepish for a moment.  "Excuse me, I7m sorry about the language.  I just get
433 lonely up here and my anger just exploded."
434     Thalor smiled at it.  "Well, what's beyond the doorway?"
435     "Ah, well, you see, I can't tell ya that.  My master placed great magicks upon my soul to prevent me from divulging
436 anything about this place.   Otherwise I would.  Sorry."
437     "Well, ok, but how do you open?"
438     "I can't tell ya that either.  Howeverer, that doesn't mean there isn't a way!"
439     Thalor looked exasperated.  He drew his sword and thrust it into the door.  the face looked calmly up at where the 
440 blade was sticking into the door and chuckled.  "Sorry, that don't work.  Take out what's left of your magical sword and 
441 try something else."
442     A look of horror crossed Thalor's face as he withdrew the remains of his sword.  The blade was totally gone.  nothg
443 left except the hilt.  He looked close to crying.
444     Angela looked on in pity.  "Why don7t you just open?  Please?"
445     The whole group looked shocked as the door slowly swung inward to reveal a dark passageway into the mountain.
446     They looked at Angela and she shrugged.  "What can I say?" she said, and then smiled.  Thalor looked daggers at her,
447 but they went in the passage.  It continued for about 10 feet and then opened into a long, winding staircase.  They lit
448 the hilt of Thalor's sword and went down.
449     Many rooms and mosters they encountered, and they found out much about the drow.  Perhaps the most interesting place
450 they fond however, was the heart gem chamber.
451     After a few days of exploring, they came to a chamber made totally of a gem.  They were flabbergasted as the huge
452 crystal glinted in the sword light.
453 
454 After many unseccessful attempts and a couple broken daggers later, they gave up on trying to remove any of the gem.
455 Looking back in longing, they continued on their explorations.
456     A week later, they arrived back in Silvermere and went to the mayor.  They told their story and he gave them each a
457 medal and a stipend for their bravery and information.

466 KEEPER, heal thyself. For self-glorifying pontifications are so rampant with
467 muddled dialogue and hipocritical doctrine most of the people reading your
468 stuff have trouble keeping their cookies. When will you ever learn that this
469 teenage Metalica devil worship is one of the most immature, self-degrading,
470 pie-in-the-sky campaigns ever thought up by drug-crazed marketing-types from
471 New York. Not unlike L. Ron Hubbard and his church, these marketers thought
472 out a complete plan of making fools out of young people, and sure enough,
473 their plan worked. You have fallen for this hook, line, and sinker. You
474 bought the farm kiddo. You are thrice cursed because first of all, you were
475 weak enough to believe that incredible tripe, secondly, you didn't grow
476 out of it, and last of all, you are trying to push your puny mental
477 gymnastics on others. Boy oh boy bucko, are you in for the hard fall when the
478 trick is revealed. Who know, they may even tell their story in the New York
479 Times, that oft-quoted black and white orb of eternal truth and information.
480 Lest you think I'm kidding, remember the church of Scientology. It all started
481 out as a mind game. Instead, weak minds, like you have demonstrated you have,
482 believed the whole package as the Word. The rest, as they say, is history.

509 Oh brother...have the Christians showed up???  What are we heathens to do?
510 I suppose we are all bound for hell anyhow, right?  All I believe is that

514 Or being Jewish, Moslem or any other

516 I can not understand why any one with
517 half a brain would worship Satan who
518 is nothing but a fallen angel with
519 meglomaniacal tendencies. He just wants
520 souls because he knows that God grieves

538 The sun beat hard upon the pavement, causing the already uncomfortable mongrel
539 upon the sidewalk to pant harder.  The clear blue of the sky fortold a
540 monotonous repetition of the day before.  A van roared by the overheated pooch,
541 stirring up a welcome breeze that prompted the dog to wag its tail briefly.
542      None of this was noticed by Farley, who sat behind the wheel of a NET-
543 issue van the agents were currently using to return to HQ and the Robotics
544 Department.  Farley had decided to ask questions directly and find out the
545 facts; also of great importance (to Farley) was the status of a group of
546 integrated chip manufacturing plants he'd asked RD to check up on.
547 James pierced Farley's protective coating of thought.  "Van handling okay,
548 Eugene?"  Garret was inspecting as many portions of the van as he could from
549 the passenger side.
550 "Certainly."  Farley whipped around another corner at top speed, driving more
551 from instinct than by paying attention to what he was doing.  His mind was
552 otherwise occupied, thinking about how he'd first met Nick Douglas, head of the
553 Robotics Department of NET.  Nick had been very interested in Fred when Farley
554 first arrived; this mutual admiration of Fred's workmanship had been the seed
555 that grew into their present close friendship.  Farley was certain that Nick
556 had more to say.
557 As did James.  "Hey, slow down, Eugene!  I like my body whole, I do."
558 Farley realized he was doing 65 in a 45 mph zone, and tried the brake.
559 Nothing happened.  He increased the pressure.  Nada.
560 With a red light and a half-dozen stopped cars before the van, Farley fought
561 to avoid killing James, himself, and 13 other people in other cars....

588 Kathy: See you then. Thanks for all the help.
589 L'Homme: Ditto.  I think the last archive distribution was #75 (5apr86)
590 can you confirm? There are two new disks, #76 and #77. 
591 ************************** CISTOP MIKEY **************************
592 P.S. You once mentioned that you were missing a file, did you ever find it?
593 I don't think I got you a replacement did I? If not, let me know which 
594 it is, and I'll bring it along.
595 P.P.S. Did you ever get the MM disk? Should I bring a replacement?
596 Voyuer: It says that it can handle T2K in its menu. You may want to
597 consider it. Fantastic program, 7 menus chock full of systems you can
598 copy back and forth from. I highly recommend it! And at $39 it is more then
599 worth the price! Buy two! It can handle both 40T and 80T drives (assuming
600 you system has 80T drives - which I know yours does). It can't handle single
601 density formats, but that is because the IBM doesn't have the ability to do
602 single density - sigh.... A simple little mod could have been done to allow
603 it, but they didn't oh well. But it does have a cassette interface! Yup, just
604 what I need on my IBM, a cassette interface. I always did enjoy taking a nice
605 little nap waiting for my program to load. Gad, I haven't even *tried* to load
606 a program from cassette in over 3 years. I don't even know if I have anything
607 anymore that CAN load from cassette. 
608 Leonard: How's the system coming? I have source to the assembler that runs
609 on the beast If you want it (later then the version Joe had). 
610 I think that the format I have does double sided disks, but I'm not sure.
611 Hey, I know, I can put it on line some time and you can down load it if
612 you want it.
