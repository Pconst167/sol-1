25 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\43
26    It was early. Kerilli sat down at her desk, which was literally buried under paperwork. As official secretary for
27 the Circle, she was stuck with coordinating the orders, decrees, and ego indulgences of the twelve, now eleven,
28 members of the council. One black-bordered note, attached to the wall above her desk, caught her eye again. It was the
29 death notice of Tariya dal-Silmarilyn, now fourteen days old. She looked at it for a long moment and shook her
30 head.
31    Such a waste. She had known Tariya for several years. They had both been last daughters, useless in the Kadan
32 hierarchy. Understanding of this special problem had forged a special bond between them, almost like kinship. To die
33 so young, ground up in this infernal war machine that their rulers had set in motion, seemed something beyond tragic.
34 Many, many young people were growing dissatisfied, demanding (such as they could) that the war be stopped. Internal
35 pressures were growing as well. If Shai-Khan didn't fall soon, the entire planet might be torn apart by a civil war.
36 And there was a further danger:
37    The Destroyer.
38    (Marax Jennis xennon-Sevis, ruler of the province of Xenis, awoke in her temporary quarters at Council Hall. Not
39 bothering with a light, she put on a robe and began to make her way across the room. She really should have turned on
40 a light. Then she might have seen the five-foot hole in the center of her chambers. Instead, she found it the hard
41 way. Similar holes had been bored in the rooms directly below, al the way to the lowest sub-basement. She fell
42 seventy-four feet to her death, screaming all the way.)
43    Kerilli paged through the reports. James Forster Mandell had last been reported in the city of Xetos, some two
44 hundred miles away. That had been three days ago. No intelligence reports have since come from the city of Xetos.
45    He was coming.
46    Tariya's death had been recorded by spy satellites within minutes but the identity of her companion had only been
47 discovered a week ago. Obviously she had been working with her mother to bring him to Kadan. They had been on their
48 way to Shaikhur, where he might or might not have done Marannon's bidding. But the fighter attack which had killed
49 Tariya had done her work for her.
50    Had they been lovers? Kerilli thought it was entirely possible. And from what they knew of the Destroyer, nothing
51 would keep him from his revenge. The Circle was in danger.
52    (The security honor guard found the eviscerated body of Josis Steriz kallak-Berintal, ruler of the province of
53 Harad-Jchal, in his quarters. They stared a long moment at the corpse, which had been mutilated with the precision of
54 a surgeon and the savagery of a wild animal. Blood dripped from the ceiling. Four of the guards ran to spread the
55 alarm. The rest were too busy being violently ill.)
56    He had to be stopped. He was ill, that much was known. The death that had always dogged his heels would soon come
57 for him. But would it come soon enough? The council consisted of the most learned and powerful mages on Kadan. Surely
58 they could stop him. If not with power, then maybe with words. He had to be made to understand that the council was
59 Kadan's only hope of survival as a civilized planet. Despite what she obviouslu thought, Marannon couldn't rule the
60 planet alone. Anarchy would soon follow despite her best efforts. Had she not let her ego get the best of her, she
61 would see that.
62    Kerilli's thoughts were interrupted by the intercom. She felt her heart go cold as she listened to the account of
63 the deaths of Marax and Josis. She was to report to the main hall immediately.
64    Before leaving she opened a bottom drawer and removed a small but powerful sidearm she kept there. Grimly she
65 strapped on the concealed leg-holster. Where power failed surprise might work. The moment they had all dreaded for so
66 long had arrived.
67    He was here.

81 GREAT CUASE TO CELEBRATE WHEN THIS STORY
82 FINALLY HITS ITS END. WE COULD THROW A

95 
96 Yes, a party to celebrate the longest-running coherent stories I've seen on
97 this illustrious board.  (ch /stories/story/). Also one of the best written.
98 I'll miss it when it's done, as I will be left with just the one-shot entries
99 and the pointless twitterings of the mindless children.  (there are exceptions
100 of course, as when piper deigns to bless us with more than his marker).
101 So raze onward, Destroyer, you have MY applause.
102           +Dante-
103 
104 I'll tell you, Destroyer.  I have only one critique with your stories.
105 I easily get confused with names like Josis Steriz, Kallak-Berintal,
106 Harad-Jchal, Kadan, Marannon, Kerelli, Marax, etc...
107 How am I supposed to keep them all straight?!

157 Question, what do I need to set 
158 differently on this board that I have
159 not been doing so far?  I seem to work
160 at 1200 baud with everyone else in 
161 town but here???   Equipment is C64
162 with 1670 modem (Hayes compatible).
163 It obviously works with other C-64
164 systems, but I also have no problems
165 with Bit Bucket, GEnie, and Dow Jones
166 News.  With the large amount of text
167 here I would like to log on at 1200
168 and capture it for later reading.
169 Any info on setting parms for 
170 Backwater @ 1200 would be appreciated.

181 WELL, I'LL BE SAD WHEN THE DESTROYERS STORY 
182 ENDS, I HAVE GOTTEN TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEW ENTRIES. ALSO, I'M LOOKING 
183 FORWARD TO THE NEXT ENTRY ABOUT PIPER. I HOPE TO SEE MORE PUNS TOO, THE GIZZARD
184 WAS SPECTACULAR. ANYWAY, HERE WITH A COMMENT -----
185      HOW MUCH IS A LIFE WORTH? WELL, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KEEP TRACK OF SUCH 
186 THINGS, THE CURRENT VALUE OF A LIFE, ACCORDING TO THE JOHNSON & JOHNSON COMPANY
187 , IS UPWARDS OF 150 MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS THE COST OF ENDING THE SALE OF 
188 TYLENOL IN CAPSULE FORM, ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE 
189 TODAY. THEY JUST HAPPENED TO MENTION THE COST OF CONVERSION, AFTER ANNOUNCING
190 THEY WOULD END THE SALE OF ALL CAPSULE MEDICATION. THEY THEN FURTHER STATED 
191 THIS COST, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE BOURNE TOTALLY BY THEM, WAS MUCH LESS THAN THE
192 COST OF THE PAIN AND SUFFERING BY THE VICTIMS FAMILY. HOWEVER, BEFORE YOU THINK
193 THAT THEY ARE WONDERFUL MARTYRS, REMEMBER THAT OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION, IN
194 CAPSULE FORM, IS TAKING A TERRIBLE SALES DIVE DUE TO THE POISONING IN NEW YORK.
195 ALSO, I CAN GUARENTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONVENIENTLY FORGET THIS FIGURE THE
196 NEXT TIME THEY ARE SUED. 
197    THE PROPER AND POLITE THING FOR J & J TO DO WOULD HAVE BEEN TO STATE THAT 
198 THEY WERE DISCONTINUING OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION IN CAPSULE FORM, AND LEAVE
199 THE COST OF CONVERSION TO SPECULATION. ALAS, IN SOCIETY TODAY, TOO MANY PEOPLE
200 AND COMPANIES ARE PLAYING THE MARYTER, AND ADVERTIZING THE FACT HEAVILY. LETS 
201 ALL GET OUT OUR VIOLINS NOW, AND PLAY FOR J & J.

209 You guys have got to be kidding. I have followed the destroyers
210 story from the beginning and I feel it is not very praiseworthy
211 at all. The characters are very weak. James is almost
212 interesting, Tariya is just cardboard. Any other characters are
213 just thrown in to keep the thing going. The plot is very
214 uneven, sometimes moving too slow to keep interest, sometimes
215 moving too fast for comprehension. Not to mention the plot
216 jumps around haphazardly, with no rhyme or reason that anyone
217 can discern. And when the heat is on for the destroyer to end
218 his story before everyone falls asleep, he disapears for a
219 couple of weeks and then returns with some major plot surprises
220 apparently just to keep interest. A couple of these major plot
221 revelations would have been much more appropriate earlier in
222 the story. Granted, he has been much better since apparently
223 revising he story, but the whole thing could have been told in
224 about one-third of the space it has used. I won't begrudge him
225 the chance to end his story, apparently some find it
226 entertaining. But I sincerely hope that when it's over he will
227 reconsider before dropping another tale like this one on us.
228 Technically he is a good writer, but no way does he have the
229 experiance or the talent to manage an undertaking of this size.
230 Hate to tell you this, guy, but you're not the hot s**t
231 everyone makes you out to be.
232 But then, that's just my opinion.

271 It does get better. Blue Parrot is an excellent writer's board and the
272 system operator does a great deal of work to keep things running smoothly.
273 It is a fine addition to the bulliten boards of Portland and it complements
274 Backwater in a delightful way. People who wish to write stories as opposed
275 to messages have two great places to go: Backwater AND Blue Parrot. Dr. F,
276 and Mikey, you both have good reason to be proud of your accomplishments.

310 your C-64 is an ASCII "underline" character. Since Commodore is the only 
311 (oops) Since Commodore & Atari are the only companies not using ASCII, your
312 borders aren't seen the way you expect them to be! (The new Atari 520ST
313 uses ASCII, the only other non-ASCII system I can think of that might still
314 be in use are the TRS-80 Model I's that may still be limping along...)
315 This is *not* an attack on you or your machine. I just thought you might like
316 to know...

338 Freddy - your comments anent DESTROYER and his work might have validity if this
339 were a publishing house, or even a college writing course, but since this is
340 just a Least-Common-Denominator bulletin board, they are irrelevant.  Compared
341 to *most* of the other writing here, his work is first-rate.  Would you rather
342 read the four lines preceeding this entry, or code, or ten consecutive lines

370         Above all cares, she was flying free in the wind.  The tree-tops
371 were far below, the green fusing into a lush carpet, interrupted here
372 and there by fields yellow in fallow or a freshly tilled brown.  The air
373 was fresh and the breeze was warm.  She felt herself an eagle,
374 majestically riding the currents, master of all below, fearless of all
375 above.  She could feel power flowing from wingtip to wingtip, filling
376 her being and electrifying each feather.  The warmth of the air and the
377 feeling of power was intoxicating.  Such a smooth, sure feeling!  It was
378 as if she could shape the world around her with a simple thought.  Even
379 as she pondered this idea, the world changed.  "Over there, a rainbow!"
380 and a band of colors spread across the east.  "Clouds, move north!" and
381 the billows of steam and moisture took up their new positions over the
382 forests.  "Let the clouds rain!" and they did.  At her direction, the
383 thunder roared, crashing at the twitch of a feather.  Lightning
384 flickered and flashed, and the winds began to rage with the storm.  She
385 was buffeted in the wind, her wind, now left, now right, becoming
386 over-powering in their ferocity.  She was soon unable to control the
387 elements any longer.  The power she had held inside now surged outward,
388 the release becoming explosive, the sound deafening.  Her feathered body
389 went into a stall, began falling; a long, slow, agonizing fall.  Time
390 seemed to stretch forever, and she saw the trees coming nearer...
391 nearer!  She couldn't pull out!  She was going to crash into the trees! 
392 "Help!  Help me, please!  Somebody..."
393 
394         Miranda awoke with a start.  The awful dream was over.  A
395 dream... a bad dream.  What was it?  "I dreamed I was... I was..."  As
396 productions of the subconsious, dreams can disappear quickly once the
397 dreamer wakes.  The hag had gone to wake Miranda for breakfast and saw
398 the girl trembling and tossing.  Knowing dreams to be of upmost
399 importance, the hag watch Miranda dream, not interrupting.  As soon as
400 it was over, the hag demanded to know what she had dreamed.  The
401 questions came so quickly they confused Miranda, and the remaining
402 memories were gone, leaving only the feeling of anxiety.
403         "I was.. a bird!" Miranda remembered triumphantly over her
404 muffin breakfast.  After relaxing and washing her face, a simple muffin
405 was given her, and the gypsies moved on.  She sat on the back of the
406 wagon again, this time of her own choice.  Pondering the muffin, the
407 dream slowly came back to her, and she explained it to the hag.
408         "Have you had this dream before?"
409         "No."
410         "Do you think you know what it means?"
411         "Could it be important?"
412         "Don't you know anything about dreams girl?" the hag hissed. 
413 Miranda shook her head.  "Dreams," continued the hag, "are our channel
414 to the spirits!  Through the spirits we can learn of things happening
415 elsewhere, things to happen, and mostly of other people.  They can tell
416 us what we must do with our craft."
417         Surely we don't need others to tell us what to do! thought
418 Miranda.  She thought of Ariel and the other spirits that her father had
419 kept captive.  They never told Prospero what to do.  But wait... they
420 had been the eyes and ears of the island.  And without Ariel's
421 assistance, they would still be on the island.
422         "I see you begin to understand."
423         "But how can we talk to the spirits in our dreams?  How do you
424 make something happen?  Dreams just come of their own..."
425         "Dreams can be tamed!  You must learn how.  Practice.  In your
426 next dreams, try to look at something in particular.  Start small.  Try
427 to look at your hands.  Force yourself to look at your hands in your
428 dream."  The hag now remained quiet, until long after lunch.
429 
430         "What's your name?"
431         The sudden break of silence startled Miranda.  The question was
432 repeated.  "Miranda" she said quietly.  Unconsciously she reached up and
433 started fondling her necklace.  Her family ring hung outside of her
434 tunic now, and the hag recognized the insignia: a pheonix over a coronet.
435         "Prospero!"
436         Miranda looked up.
437         "You are the daughter of Milan?"  Miranda nodded, knowing the
438 significance of the title.  "Why are you here?  What do you seek?"
439         Miranda told the hag of the her father's library, and of the
440 three books of transformation.
441         "I know of the books.  They are very rare.  Much have I longed
442 to hold them, to know their contents.  How did Prospero get the books?"
443         When Miranda told the hag of the inscription from Ii Orpyak, the
444 hag breathed in sharply.  "The old devil!  But aren't there four books?"
445 Immediately the hag realized Miranda's quest.
446         "To find the fourth book will be treacherous.  You need to learn
447 to protect yourself and to know when to be silent.  As I said before, I
448 shall teach you.  I am too old to undertake such a quest, but you are
449 young.  You might just have the strength.
450         "Lesson number one," the hag continued, "never tell a stranger
451 your purposes.  Lesson number two: I am Anysca, sorceress, niece to the
452 great Ii Orpyak."

470 To: unsigned critic of my comments...
471 *You* need to pay more attention. I was talking about Neohama's *normal*
472 border, which he enters from a Commodore. I also very clearly said 
473 "back-arrow", not "backspace. As you apparently do not know, there are 
474 a number of machines that have arrow characters in their character sets.
475 The "back-arrow" is a arrow pointing to the left. On a Commodore it is 
476 CHR$(95), on a TRS-80 Model I it is CHR$(93), on Tandy 100 & 200 it is
477 CHR$(155), on the IBM PC it is....
478 I might also add that in the *original* definition of the ASCII set 94
479 was an up-arrow (not a caret) & 95 was a back-arrow (as opposed to the
480 current underline)
481 Ok? I'd be a lot more polite if you had bothered to 
482 *SIGN* your entry. I see no need to waste politeness on anonymous 
483 snipers.

485      Milchar's sudden appearance only startled Bard for a minute. As soon 
486 as he saw him begin a healing spell he started to relax. Piper might just
487 make it. 
488      About then the flames on Milchar's robe registered. Bard grabbed the
489 extinguisher....

505    Bard was taking care of the flames along the fringes of Milchar's robe,
506 when he another area on the floor about three feet behind Milchar begin to
507 glow in a color similar to the flames. Without thinking, Bard turned the
508 attention of the extinguisher on the spot. When the propellent hit the
509 glowing area, it exploded in a shower of light. The retardent material
510 seemed to mix with the glow, instead of extinguish it, and the resultant
511 reaction made Bard cover his eyes with his left hand while his right hand
512 kept the nozzle pointed firmly at the now growing area on the floor. Through
513 all this commotion, Milchar's attention was not disturbed. He was in deep
514 concentration with his healing spells.
515    Suddenly a voice emerged from within the ball of light. At first Bard
516 didn't recognize it, but as his memory locked on to the distinctive
517 pronunciation of a man he knew well, he shut off the extinguisher, moved
518 back a step, crossed his arms, and smiled.
519    "Shut it off I say! I'm not on fire, nor is your ship on fire!"
520    Finally the person behind the voice emerged, and Cragmore stepped from
521 the cloud of light, which went away as quickly as it came, leaving only a
522 small wet stain on the floor.
523    "Haven't you ever seen a psi-gate before? You've covered me with fire
524 retardent. What a mess!"
525    Bard could only chuckle. "Sorry Cragmore. I was taking care of a small
526 robe fire here on Milchar..."
527    "Milchar? Oh, the man healing...healing, Piper! I thought I felt him as
528 I entered the ship. I felt something else, associated with Piper. He's in
529 trouble. And Milchar is trying to help him, right?"
530    "Correct, as usual. You big heads always seem to know what's going on."
531    "Yes, and I know something else. At least I have a feeling. You see, I
532 followed Milchar here through the psi, he leaves a strong trail you know, but
533 I feel strong emenations from Piper, now that I am here. Bard, we have to
534 stop Milchar. We have to get him out of his trance."
535    "You mental-guys are also crazy. If Milchar stops now, Piper might die.
536 You can see that, can't you?"
537    "Yes Bard, I can see. That is the whole point. I CAN see. Piper... I don't
538 quite know how to say this. I told you I felt something strange about Piper
539 as I came in. He is in trouble, dying. But... this is difficult Bard... It
540 could be a mistake, a false image of something..."
541    "What are you trying to say? I have never seen you so tongue-tied!"
542    "I think, I feel, that Piper wants to die."

548 This is another Destroyer boarder. As most of you have probably guessed, I call in to this system at least 5 times a
549 day to see what people are saying about my story, and to generally check in on things. I leave my /// boarder almost every
550 time I call, except when I want to make a snide remark, and then I either use another name, guess which ones, or I make
551 the entry without signing it at all. I just thought you might like a little clarification on what the continual ///'s
552 meant all the time. This clarification being done, I will now close the messege. Thank you for your time.

608    Now about my border... I was using an Apple 2E when I couldn't find the
609 back arrow. This term is not displaying it because instead of a block for
610 a cursor it has a back arrow. 
611 By the way, Commodores drive me crazy with the memory and crazy bit-map. 
612 Dont worry about insulting them-it's pretty hard to do anyway.
613    Meanwhile, another emotion dump.

615 
616     Lying Dorment.
617   Time has gone by, and I am no longer a little boy who enjoys playing with
618 his toys, or riding bikes with a friend. I used to get mad because Gilligans
619 Island was preempted by a football game. Now I get mad because my dad is 
620 using the computer. I no longer play hide and seek with the other kids on
621 the block but scorn the new generation for acting as I once did.
622   I was 8 years old. I played with my hot-wheeles set and loved to set up 
623 obsticles for the cars. I used to love Saturday morning cartoons. In 2 weeks
624 I grew 7 years, and missed half my life. Somewhere in those 2 weeks I mis-
625 placed myself and couldn't find where. I gave away the rest of me, here and
626 there, leaving evedence I existed.
627   I wear the mask that hides all. I hide my true feelings. Humor is great,
628 a good substitute for feeling good. You may never know if I hate you like 
629 hell, or love you. Sometimes I dont know either. Could there be hope for me?
