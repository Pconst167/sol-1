54 toward their next trip down babbling brook,  c) slink quietly back to the

90 Why recycle? It is cheaper, both in initial cost, and later in operating
91 costs to make the container part of the product, or itself useful. 
92 Failing that, make it so thin it is worthless. The fact that byproducts
93 can be made from 'waste' doesn't help much as they are usually of much 
94 less value.
95 The fact that something can be done, and that doing it may be good isn't
96 enough, it must be better to do it than not to. Speaking of the 'cost'
97 of something may seem only to imply dollars, but if I may, it can also 
98 refer to all things bad in doing something. In order to balance whether
99 something is best done, or if doing it does more harm than good, we need
100 to measure both the good and the bad in some common way, usually by
101 assigning a dollar value to each. It isn't always easy. What is the value
102 of clean air? (This means less medical bills as well as pretty sky.)
103 What is a human life worth? (Read this last as "what are we willing to
104 pay for a safer highway?") At what level of risk from contamination will
105 we draw the line? (This risk is higher with recycled stuff.)
106 The costs of recycling are hidden because they are spread out. Returning
107 the used bottles from the grocer is cheap, as noted the same truck can
108 take them back, but the grocer needs to store the dirty, unsanitary bottles.
109 Do you want trash stored with your food? Newspapers are often recycles
110 because of their high visiblity, but newprint is the least valuable paper.
111 
112 Recycling on a consumer level is best described as a hobby: fun but not
113 very valuable. It can be made to turn a profit, but the time spent doing
114 it could be more valuable doing something else. However, if you like to
115 do it , do it. But don't tell me how wonderful it is, if it was so great
116 we would have to fight off the big companies for it.

120 BAD: sorry it took so long to get back to you. 
121 Metalaw is an attempt to constuct an ethical system that could
122 be applied "universally". The "standard" case that I've seen is
123 "Ok, a spaceship from Mugwump VII has just landed. This "creature"
124 has slithered out. It seems to be intelligent. On what basis are
125 you going to interact with it? (remember the Indians!)"
126 	As you can see, when they say universal they aren't kidding!
127 Actually they do seem to have some interesting & possibly useful
128 ideas. If you're interested I'll try to find some of my references.
129 _______________________________F - I W_________________________
130 As to recycling, I note that industry isn't filling all those
131 dumps, consumers are! If there is a use for a waste material
132 industry will sell it for that purpose. I work at Wacker Siltronic
133 and we make silicon wafers for Intel, TI, etc. We have lots of
134 "waste" silicon (bad wafers, process scrap, etc) all of it "too
135 contaminated" to be recycled (ie more than .0000001% impurities)
136 What do we do with it? We sell it to steel mills as high purity
137 silicon for silicon steels. (their idea of high purity= 99.9%).
138 We do have wastes that aren't recycled. They are either in small
139 amounts (ie too expensive) or useless.
140 	The consumer (you and me) can rarely get as much out of
141 recycling as we put in, or at least it feels that way. We can't
142 sell much of our waste products & those that we can don't net
143 enough for the time we put in. We need some sort of centralized
144 setup to have enough volume to be worth the trouble. But I suspect
145 that we won't vote to pay for it. Too bad, we could use it.
146 	As for the returnable bottle problem: I have a friend
147 who works for a supermarket. He told me why they don't like
148 returnable cans (bottles aren't QUITE as bad!). They have to pay
149 for the cans individually, but they get paid for them by the BAG!
150 Since there are usually a few squashed, bent etc cans they lose
151 money. But neither they nor the drivers have the time (@ $$/hr)
152 to count things individually. Come up with a PRACTICAL solution
153 to this and you'll make a LOT of people happy.
154 ........................Leonard.............................
155 THOSE CANS THAT ARE TAKEN BACK BY STORES ARE USUALLY BY MEASURE
156 OF THE BAG SIZE AND NOT THE CONTENT OF THE BAG BY WEIGHT WHICH
157 IT SOULD BE-MOST CANS ARE PRODUCDED BY VOLUME ON A WEIGHT SCALE
158 IN RELATION TO THE RAW MATERIALS THAT GO INTO THEM-THE ONLY DIFF
159 -ENCE IS THE SIZE-NO BIG PROBLEM TO OVERCOME.A GOOD WAY TO SAVE
160 SOME ENERGY, COMPARED TO WHAT IT TAKES TO MELT THOSE MATERIALS
161 (RAW)TO GET THE FIRST FORM(CANS)THE VOLUME THAT LEONARD TALKED
162 ABOUT BEFORE THIS IS RIGHT THERE-QUOTE-"DUMPS"YOU HAVE A MASS OF
163 MATERIALS THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH SO IT GET'S THROWN
164 INTO THE CAN BEHIND THE HOUSE, BUT MOST OF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT
165 CAN BE RE-USED, BE IT BOTTLES USED OVER OR MATERIALS THAT CAN BE.
166 WE HAVE THE LUXURY OF THROWING IT OUT BUT WILL WE ALWAYS HAVE THAT?
167 WHY NOT RECYCLE NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THE IMPARITIVIES OF USE
168 AND ACCESS..........................THE O.J.KID.......4/5/83......
169 COMPUTER CARDS(PUNCH)ARE ABOUT THE BEST PAPER YOU CAN RECYLE AND
170 PRINT OUT COMES NEXT TO NEWSPRINT AND CARDBOARD AND THESE ARE ONLY
171 FIBER MATERIALS IN THE TOP RECYCABLES OF PAPER-THERE ARE MANY MORE
172 DOWN THE SCALE AND MANY ARE BENIFITTING FROM JUST THIS AVENUE.THE
173 WHOLE SITUATION HAS BECOME BLURRED BY WHAT MIGHT BE COST EFFECTIVE
174 BUT THERE ISN'T A SOUND BASE HERE IF YOU THROW ALL ATTACHMENTS OF---
175 IT WILL COST MORE, IT'S TRASH-I DON'T WANT IT AROUND, IT'S TO MUCH
176 TROUBLE,WILL I HAVE TO TAKE IT TO A CENTER, I DON'T HAVE THE TIME,
177 LET SOMEONE ELSE DO IT,....WHAT IS THE ANWSER????REALIZING THAT WE
178 DON'T HAVE TO WASTE ANYTHING-WE ALL BENIFIT IN THE END BY REUSING.

180 Although I may have seemed to, i don't mean that recycling is bad, there
181 are other benefits otthat are hard to see, like long term shortages, but
182 in balance, the reason there is little household recycling is very simple:
183 it isn't worth it. There is a good reason why the bottlers fight the
184 recycling, it costs them more. As to waiting for the time when we 
185 absolutely must recycle, it probably is the best way to get people to do
186 it, and is a valid reason; whereas the present blather is just that, and
187 there is really very little reason to recycle most stuff now, directly.
188 The bigger problem is getting rid of the wastes. Recycling will not help
189 here much, because it only deals with the better stuff, not the high
190 volume trash. If you really want to do something useful, invent a workable
191 way to burn trash cleanly. (It might even turn a profit, there is a lot of
192 fuel value in garbage; but if it is only cheaper than what we have it will
193 pay off.)

211 _________________________________________
212 	I might be more enthusiasic about recycling, except for all
213 the nature-nuts and eco-freaks around.  Unusually disgusting example:
214 A few years ago I saw some show where some enthusiastic loonie suggested
215 that if we must watch our energy-wasteful televisions, we should get
216 some sort of pedalled alternator and generate our own electricity.
217 
218 	What a LOONIE!  First, there is the not-insignificant possibility
219 that this could damage the TV.  Second, TV's don't use much electricity,
220 anyway.  Third, watching TV can use a lot less juice than most anything
221 else, including reading under a lamp.  Fourth, the overall cost of food
222 energy is probably 100 times more expensive than hydropower, coal, or
223 nuclear-powered generation.  
224 	True, pedalling such a monstrosity would be good excercise, but
225 that wasn't that idiot's main idea.  While this idea may be on the "lunatic
226 fringe", I see reasoning that is only somewhat less insane every day.
227 	There are some places where conservation and recycling can,
228 should, and will be done.  And I'll help. (I already do.)  But correspondingly,
229 some things can't be done.  Learn the difference.

256 To SPAM:  Science DOES seek to establish truth.  Even your beloved
257 empirical approach does.  Both Special and General Relativity were
258 theoretical speculation that was later confirmed empirically by experiment.
259 As you pointed out, reasoning can be inductive or deductive.  Truth is
260 the recognition of reality and is achieved thru reasoning.  Truth is
261 verified empirically but is postulated theoretically.  Seeking theories
262 that are "true" is implicit in all science.  But as in all endeavors,
263 there are charlatans.  By their fruits ye shall know them, as HUMBUG 
264 alluded to.  To HUMBUG: This is a free forum--you just don't like to be

322 I put you in for balance (ballast?).  I find it amusing that "philosiphors"

423 Having thought at length about boy-girl-computer relations rather frequently, I
424 have drawn the conclusions that  (1) if you are of high school or college age,
425 you'll probably have increasing opportunities for electronic gratification with
426 opposite-gender types, and  (2) if you're out of school, you'll do better to 
427 pull the plug regularly {don't want to become totally enraptured with these
428 things, do you} and to just ask someone you've met AROUND some computer in use
429 to join you for refreshments and recreation.  Don't forget: computers are still
430 cold and impersonal to many people;  the cry for opposite-gender friendship is
431 destined to be ignored by those who prefer face-to-face interaction, without
432 this electronic intermediary.  If you buy (1) and (2), I offer you a home-spun
433 rule:  If it's your work, don't also make it your hobby.

447 Computers are especially addictive, often to the chagrin of the
448 computer-widows.  Both my father and cousin are 'guilty' of
449 practically abandoning their wives for hours on end, totally
450 enraptured by their computers.  I'm not claiming innocence:
451 I was the one that started them on this road.
452 	Remember the old saying: "Women; you can't live with them
453 and you can't live without them."  In computers, that saying
454 turns out to be: "Computers; your female friends can't live with
455 them and you can't live without them."
456 **************************************
457 The reason there are so few women on the BBS' is that they
458 are so selfish and self-centered and the computer does nothing
459 to flatter them
460 *****************Max Grody**********************************
461 Well, at least that's a different outlook on the subject. I can't say
462 as I agree with it, but it is different. Actually I know of a number
463 of women who work with or on computers, however most of them don't 
464 really care for an extended relationship with the computer, and I don't
465 blame them for it. It is very difficult to have any kind of meaningfull
466 relationship with a computer. When was the last time you saw a computer
467 ask its operator out to a dinner, or the movies? Lets face it, COMPUTERS
468 ARE NO FUN!!! So why am I here using this computer? It is simple, I am
469 a certified C.P.A. (Computer Phreak Aholic) Maybe we should form a 
470 group to help one anouther get over this insane and social threating
471 disease. We could call it CPA. (Computer Pheaks Anonymous) Some one help
472 me please before I turn into a Z80! How to identify a real C.P.A.
473 "Not now honey, I'm trying to get this sort routine working."
474 "I can't use the keyboard in that position!" "please, you're getting
475 whipped cream on the listings!" "What do you mean you have a headache?
476 It's only 2000 more lines of code for you to type in." "Honey?" Honey?..."

502 With bad spelling like nearly every message on this disk, it's a wonder
503 we all can communicate.  Cmon, folks, if you can't spell it, don't say
504 it.  There ought to be a "National Be Kind to Literates" week.

506 WHAT ABOUT A NATIONAL BE KIND TO ILLITERATES WEEK?

508 It is estimated that there were some 3 to 4 million computers sold last
509 year. Are they taking over the world? Not yet, it is also estimated that
510 1 human brain ha about the same computing power as all 3,000,000 of them.
511 And ther were over 50 million people born in the same time.
512        Of course, considering the comments on this BBS, I wonder if any
513 of them think. (either computers or humans)

515 Mike: Some modems WON'T drop carrier until the other end does!
516 I became painfully aware of this some time back. I have Ma Bell's
517 "wonderful" home executive service, which allows 2 lines on 1
518 phone (while using the existing wiring!). To hang up my phone
519 I had to turn off the modem. This sent a pulse(or something)
520 that the home exec unit would trip out on. THIS required dis-
521 connecting the phone (in 2 places!). I have since kludged up
522 a solution, but it was VERY annoying for awhile.
523 	In case the above makes someone wonder about the home
524 executive service, my advice is DON'T!!!! Besides the problem
525 with relays inside the unit triggering out of sequence which
526 caused the above problem, there are others. The worst is cross-
527 talk between the lines. If line #1 rings while I'm on-line on
528 line 2 the ring pulses leaking over scramble data wonderfully.
529 (it once took 5 minutes for the download program to recover
530 from all the errors caused by TWO (2) RINGS!). I am slowly
531 rewiring for 2 lines so I can get out from under. Take my advice
532 and avoid this mistake.

536 B.A.D.:
537 	In regard to my previous msg, since you seem to be
538 "connected" with Ma Bell, could you tell me where I could get
539 info on the pinout for 50-pin telephone connectors. I could
540 also use info on how the phone co. would feel about my wiring
541 one up so I could use both my phone lines from one phone (using
542 something along the lines of one of Radio Shack's multi-line
543 contollers)?

590 Ironic thought:
591 	A few years ago Byte magazine did a survey of its readers, and
592 found that only around 1% were female.  This seems to be highly significant
593 (though in recent years it may have changed) because:
594 	1.	Computer industry isn't a old industry, set it its ways.
595 	2.	To program computers doesn't require anything in the way
596 		of muscles or aggressiveness, etc.
597 	3.	Computing can be a 'private' hobby.  There is no 'male
598 		stigma' attached to it.
599 	4.	Most hobbyists are self-motivated, and do not require
600 		external assistance to operate computers.
601 	5.	I have never observed an anti-female bias in fellow
602 		hackers.
603 
604 	So why only 1%, when most other jobs that have lots of strikes against
605 them (old, male-dominated, competitive, full of bias) generally have much
606 more than 5% women?  The old arguments that these factors cause a 
607 disproportionate number of men in a hobby/job don't seem to hold up here.
608 My theory is that for some reason, women have VOLUNTARILY chosen to ignore
609 computers.  This suggests that perhaps many other fields' "discrimination"
610 is similarly voluntary.  Think about it.
611 ==========?==========?=========?========?========?========?=======?=======
612 REGARDING THE CONTINUING CONTROVERY OVER THE MODEM HANGUP PROBLEM, I FIND
613 (AFTER PORING OVER VARIOUS SPECIFICATIONS AND DATA SHEETS) THAT THE
614 RESPONSIBILITY FOR INITIATING THE DISCONNECTION LIES WITH THE ANSWERING
615 DEVICE (I.E., THE BBS).  IT MUST EITHER STOP ITS CARRIER, OR SEND A 
616 CONTINUOUS SPACE CHARACTER FOR OVER 1.5 SECONDS.  EITHER OF THESE ACTIONS
617 WILL CAUSE A PROPERLY OPERATING  SENDING DEVICE (USER) TO STOP SENDING THE
618 CARRIER.  AT THIS POINT, THE ANSWERING DEVICE CAN (SHOULD) HANG UP, AND
619 SIMILARLY THE SENDING DEVICE CAN (SHOULD) HANG UP.
620 	OF COURSE, AN ACCOUSTIC-COUPLED MODEM REQUIRES HUMAN INTERVENTION
621 TO HANG UP, WHILE A DIRECT-CONNECT BUGGER WILL DO IT AUTOMATICALLY (WE HOPE)
622 HOWEVER, THERE IS REALLY NO WAY THAT SUCH A MODEM CAN KNOW TO HANG UP 
623 UNLESS IT DETECTS THE LOSS OF CARRIER ON THE LINE.
624 	YES, EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE A STANDARD COMES IN HANDY.  APPRECIATE THE
625 ONES WE HAVE, AND WORK OUT A FEW NEW ONES, PLEASE.
