21     "Watch OUT!", Parity roared, as he grabbed Farley by the shirt, and pulled
22 him out of the way of a passing trolley car. "I told you to be careful. Those
23 things move faster than they appear to be able to. We don't need a NET casualty
24 due to non-mission related occurrences."
25     "Yea, and think of the headlines! NET AGENT FARLEY'S TICKET CANCELLED BY
26 TROLLEY CAR. FILM AT ELEVEN." chimed in Fellows.
27     Farley, who was visibly shaken, quickly straightened hiw shirt, gave Fellows
28 a quick sneer, and pointed across the street.
29     "That's why I was in such a hurry. See that limo over there parked at the
30 boutique? The one with the vanity plates. Look at what the plates say."
31     "M-S L-A-M-B. Ms Lamb! It's probably her car. Good job Farley, but it's
32 not worth getting run over for." Parity warned. "But you did good. You saved 
33 us going down to the DMV and running a computer check on our Ms. Lamb."
34     "What now?", asked Fellows. "A tri-tail multi-incognito surveillance? A
35 NET shell-escapades lookout? Or a direct frontal assault?"
36     "Multi-tri-escapade-shell-assault?" Farley mumbled.
37     "Don't let Fellows get to you Farley. I've seen him before in San
38 Francisco. It acts on him like some sort of Elixir. Fellows is unpredictable
39 in this fair city, but he is still one of the best field agents around."
40     "Oh yes Parity... Remember the last time down here, when we went to that
41 'club?' You were quite a sight in..."
42     "Never mind Fellows! You told me it was a normal club. I should have known
43 you would never go to a normal club with me along. Anything to embarrass me, eh
44 Fellows?"
45     "Knock it off you two! The limo is starting to move! How are we going to
46 follow it?" Farley demanded.
47     "Relax." And with a wave of Parity's hand, a cab pulled up in front of
48 the trio. Fellows sat in front; Parity and Farley in back.
49     With a grin, Fellows gave the cabbie his instructions. "I bet you have
50 never heard this before, but FOLLOW THAT CAR!"

68 He had found the cave almost by accident, really; he had taken shelter from a 
69 fresh battering of ice and snow when    over a small hillock his eyes picked out
70    it's darkly blurred outline. Scrambling, half falling down the slippery bank, 
71 Rhian fervently hoped that it was what  he thought it was.. and hoped even more
72 fervently that if it was, it wasn't     occupied.
73      The cave mouth was huge, taller    than a tree and wider than two.   
74 stumbling on frozen feet, Rhian clamberdover the high drifts that almost 
75 totally filled the entrance. As he cleared the crest, he could feel within the 
76 dark, claustrophobic comfort of walls.  And something else; something quite 
77 
78  strange. From somewhere inside the cave he could feel a weird, but utterly 
79 welcome sensation. Warmth. It emminated from the walls, the floors; it hung in
80 the air like a blessed curtian between  Rhian and the snow. Shrugging it off,  
81 He supposed it came from some deep hot
82 springs; the mountians were volcanic.   Besides, what possible evil could come 
83 or be expected to come from such a kind,benevolent climate? Rhian refused to 
84 believe otherwise as he found his way 
85 into a warm, and particularly dry ante- cave. As he shed his wet cloak an
86 pack, he could tell by the echoing, 
87 hollow sound that filled the chamber    that it was much larger than it seemed.
88 With a sore sigh, Rhian resloved to do  some exploring. Such caves could hold
89 many fascinating secrets. But not until after he had resigned himself to a good
90 long sleep. And even as the thoughts    faded from his mind, he was dead to the
91 world, more comfortable than he had beenin quite some time.
92      Rhian woke slowly, his sleepy browneyes heavy with the soft relaxation 
93 that enveloped him. But what he saw caused them to snap open in confusion. What
94 he now could see as a room of stone was brilliantly lit by thirteen evenly
95 spaced torches. Flamelig flickered heavily over a strangely glittering floor.
96 Rhian sat up as quickly as his travel   sore muscles would allow, his eyes
97 widening in confusion that quickly
98 began to turn into breathless delight.  The floor was covered, from the edges 
99 to the center in gleaming treasur; gold silver, emeralds, platinum, rubies; 
100 anything that was prescious or beautifullay scattered in a haphazard disorder 
101 Rising slowly, Rhian surveyed with      bewildered happiness the huge amassment
102 of riches. There were the shining swordsof warriors and the jewels swords of
103 ceremony; golden crowns of long dead    kingdoms, bracelets, rings, chains,eons
104 worth of meticulous craftsmanship. He   dug his hand ginderly into the pile, 
105 lest it be an illusion, created in a    frozen mind. The cold, smooth feel of  
106 gold met his eager touch. This was no   illusion. Catching another handful, he
107 let forth a joyous shout, finally allowing himself to trust in his good fortune
108 As the torchlight danced over the goldenrain, Rhian began to think of the
109 ramifications of life as a rich man. He could now have anything; the good life
110 was within his cgrasp. Anything! A high
111 bred wife, a fortress, an army to       vanquish anything he could envision..
112      " Are you enjoying yourself, thief?" A low, raspy voice rumbled from the 
113 dark end of the cave. Rhian froze, his 
114 heart threatening to burst from the     tremendous leap it took within his 
115 chest. grasping at a beaten sword, he   faced the voice, bacing slowly toward
116 the exit.
117      "Don't go.." The words were more a command than a request, and when Rhian 
118 kept moving, a brilliant, white streak  of flame shot just to his left, barely
119 missing him. Rhian stopped.
120      " Not paying respect to those whose cave shelters you is rude, but pulling
121 our own sword on us is.. well.. grounds for quite serious punishment." From the
122 gloom, two green eyes shone.
123      " Who are you? " Rhian ventured    shakily.
124      The voice was a sneer. " Humans. Nosight for the dark whatsoever. No
125 wonder they so fear it." THe voice rang with contempt. "Well, if we must show 
126 
127 ourself, we must, though we never have been one to cater to the wishes of men."
128      The voice rang with sarcasm and a  great feeling of being put out.
129      Rhian felt himself tense as he saw the huge, black scaled creature emerge,
130 and he knew imeediately what it was.

133      Below, helicopters moving like hornets, swept across the Afghan valley
134 disrupting the spring stillness.  Afternoon shadows lengthened over the
135 jumbled slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains.  Above, Mohammed Wassir 
136 crouched at the mouth of a shallow cave, watching tight-lipped as the 
137 Russian gunships left white and grey explosions in their path.  He shook
138 his head sadly and moved back into the cave.
139      Mohammed's friend, Ming Louie, sat at the rear of the cave.  Dressed
140 in buff colored clothes, he was a stout man with tight Asian features and
141 straight, coarse black hair.  Only Ming's speech showed his third gener-
142 ation San Fransiscan heritage.  "Are they still at it?"
143      "Yes, my friend, if looks as if they will continue until sunset.  As
144 soon as night comes, we will resume our trek to the boarder."
145      "You know, we could get killed this way.  The Russians have increased
146 the bounty on out heads."  Ming said.
147      "Perhaps it has something to do with you putting saltpeter in their
148 Borsch supply, eh?"  Mohammed said.  "No matter.  Salazar's message stated
149 that we contact him as soon as possible.  An urgent matter."
150      "Those limp wimps have no sense of humor,"  Ming said innocently, 
151 "Where do we go once in Pakistan?"
152      "The Thai embassy, they have secure communications we can use."
153      "I can't understand why Salazar didn't tell the courier what he needed
154 He knows that we..."  Ming's next words were lost in the din of deafening
155 explosions.  The earth rippled.  Stone shards fell upon huddled bodies.
156 Both men covered their heads.  Dust filled the air like morning fog.  The
157 hunters neared their prey.
158      After a moment, silence returned.  Ears still ringing, Ming was the 
159 first to speak.  "Well, Mohammed, this is another fine mess you've gotten
160 me into."
161      "Pardon?"  Mohammed asked, his hand cupping his ear.
162      "Forget it!"  Ming said disgustedly.
163      The men resumed their wait.  Outside, shadows slowly lengthened.  The
164 cool mountain evening approached.  An evening when silent predators would
165 stalk the unaware.

170                          FORTUNES OF A FOOL: PART II
171 "I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT WAY," IVAN SAID. "I SUPPOSE THAT'S BECAUSE I'M SIMPLE. I NEVER REALIZED THAT I WAS SO WELL OFF."
172 "THAT'S JUST THE TROUBLE WITH MOST PEOPLE,"SAID THE FROG. "THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'VE GOT IT GOOD."
173 IVAN THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT, AND HE DECIDED THAT THE FROG WAS RIGHT. H REALLY HAD THE BEST OF IT. AND, REALIZING THAT,
174 IVAN FELT SORRY FOR THE FROG.
175 "I'LL TELL YOU WHAT," HE SAID "WHY DON'T YOU COME HOME WITH ME?"
176 "AND GET EATEN BY YOUR DOG?" THE FROG SAID. "NO, THANK YOU."
177 "WE DON'T HAVE A DOG," IVAN SAID. "AUNT SONYA HAS A CAT, BUT HE'S OLD AND FAT AND LAZY. HE NEVER LEAVES THE HOUSE, AND IF HE
178 SEES A MOUSE, ALL HE DOES IS LOOK AT IT."
179 "WHERE WOULD I SLEEP?" THE FROG ASKED.
180 "IN THE BARN WITH ME. YOU DON'T TAKE UP MUCH ROOM. AND I COULD SHARE MY MEALS WITH YOU, SINCE YOU DON'T EAT VERY MUCK. AFTER
181 ALL, IT'S ONLY FAIR, SINCE I'M SO MUCH MORE FORTUNATE THAN YOU."
182 "YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?" THE FROG ASKED.
183 "WHY NOT?" REPLIED IVAN. "IT WOULD COST ME NOTHING, AND WITH YOU AROUND, I'D HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO. I'D LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T
184 YOU?"
185 SO IVAN TOOK THE LITTLE FROG AND PLACED IT GENTLY IN HIS POCKET. AND THAT NIGHT THEY SLEPT TOGETHER IN THE BARN ON THE MATRESS
186 OF WARM STRAW.
187 THE NEXT DAY, THE FROG SAID, "IVAN, I THINK WE SHOULD GET MMARRIED."
188 "MARRIED!?" SAID IVAN, ASTONISHED.
189 "YES, MARRIED," SAID THE FROG. "AFTER ALL, IT'S ONLY RIGHT. I AM FEMALE, AND WE SLEPT TOGETHER ON THE SAME STRAW MATRESS. WHAT
190 WILL PEOPLE SAY?"
191 "I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE A FEMALE," SAID IVAN.
192 "THAT CHANGES NOTHING," SAID THE FROG. "PEOPLE WILL TALK."
193 "WHY SHOULD THEY?" ASKED IVAN. "NO ONE KNOWS YOU SPENT THE NIGHT WITH ME."
194 "I KNOW," SAID THE FROG. "AFTER ALL, I HAVE MY PRINCIPLES. WHAT SORT OF A FROG DO YOU THINK I AM?"
195 "BUT...I DON'T WANT TO GET MARRIED," IVAN PROTESTED.
196 "WHY NOT?"
197 IVAN THOUGHT HARD. "I CAN'T AFFORD A WIFE," HE REPLIED TRIUMPHANTLY.
198 "WHAT'S TO AFFORD?" SAID THE FROG. "YOU YOURSELF SAID THAT HAVING ME LIVE WITH YOU COST YOU NOTHING. I EAT ONLY CRUMBES OF STALE199 BREAD AND THE OCCASIONAL ICKY FLY, AND I DON'T TAKE UP MUCH ROOM ON YOUR STRAW MATRESS. BESIDES, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY ME
200 CLOTHES, AND I DON'T WEAR ANY JEWELRY. IT WOULD WEIGH ME DOWN. AND YOU DO ADMIT THAT IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO WHO
201 DOESN'T DISMISS EVERYTHING YOU SAY AS BEING UNIMPORTANT."
202 IVAN PURSED HIS LIPS AND GRUDGINGLY CONCEDED THAT THE FROG HAD A POINT. THEN HE BRIGHTENED. "SUPPOSE YOU GIVE BIRTH TO TADPOLES?203 "THAT TAKES TWO YOU KNOW," THE FROG ANSWERED WRYLY. "I CAN HARDLY DO THAT WITHOUT YOUR COOPERATION, AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,204 I'M NOT TOO EXCITED BY THE IDEA. SLEEPING WITH YOU IS CHANGING ENOUGH. I HAVE TO WATCH OUT IN CASE YOU ROLL OVER, AND BESIDES,
205 YOU SNORE."
206 IVAN WAS HAVING A HARD TIME TRYING TO FOLLOW THE FROG'S LOGIC, BUT THEN IVAN HAD A HARD TIME TRYING TO FOLLOW ANY KIND OF LOGIC
207 AT ALL. HE FROWNED, THINKING HARD AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH A CONVENIENT EXCUSE TO MAINTAIN HIS BACHELOR STATUS.
208 "I WOULD MARRY YOU," HE SAID AT LAST, "ONLY NO PRIEST WOULD MARRY US. WHAT PRIESTIN HIS RIGHT MIND WOULD MARRY A HUMAN TO A
209 FROG?"
210 "IF I CAN FIND A PRIEST TO MARRY US," SAID THE FROG, "THEN WOULD YOU DO IT?"
211 "IF YOU CAN FIND A PRIEST WILLING TO PERFORM THE CEREMONY, THEN I'LL MARRY YOU," SAID IVAN, CONFIDENT THAT NO PRIEST WOULD EVER
212 BE SO HARE-BRAINED AS TO MARRY A PERSON TO A FROG. I MIGHT BE SIMPLE, IVAN THOUGHT, BUT I'M NOT STUPID!
213 UNFORTUNATELY, THE FROG DID FIND SUCH A PRIEST. FATHER DMITRI WAS VERY OLD AND VERY DEAF. HE WAS ALSO BLIND. BUT HE WAS NOT DUMB214 , AND HE COULD SAY THE WORDS. THE CEREMONY WAS TASTEFUL AND, WELL, SIMPLE.

223 Riding in a car in San Fran was quite a different experience than what Farley
224 was used to.  The hills made things bad enough for drivers, but the cable cars
225 added a new twist that brought a new meaning to the words 'defensive driving'.
226 "I think the limo's driver has noticed us," L'homme said.  "He's trying to
227 evade."
228 "And YOU wouldn't, under the same circumstances?" Fellows asked.  "I mean
229 REEEAAAALLLY.  Do you believe Ms. Lamb to be quite stupid?"
230 "Don't forget, we still don't know for sure if that's her car.  I'm beginning
231 to wonder..."
232 "Wonder what?" asked Fellows.  "This is your typical A-Team car chase here.
233 No complications, no worries, except that if we crash, there's a good chance
234 of someone being hurt instead of everyone miraculously crawling out unscathed."
235 Farley, in the meantime, seemed engrossed in the interior of the cab.  Some
236 particular detail caught his attention, and his brow furrowed.
237 "Farley?" L'homme asked.
238 Farley, the full impact of his new-found information hitting him, held a
239 finger to his lips to sign silence.  Carefully and quietly, he showed the other
240 two a small disk placed under the corner of the floormat.  He signaled, in
241 NET sign language he had learned only a few days before, "listening device".
242 The utility of even his crash-course training was beginning to become acutely
243 apparent to him.
244 "Yes, L'homme?" Farley said.  He knew that he had to respond, so those 
245 that listened would not get suspicous.
246 "Where did you say you made accomodation arrangements?" L'homme said.
247 #Arrangements!# Farley thought.  #Does he mean for me to misguide them?#
248 "Why, the local Hilton, of course."  In Portland, arrangements had been made
249  at another, less prominent hotel.
250 "Good." L'homme sounded just a bit smug, perhaps glad that Farley had 
251 understood him.
252 "Well, Ms. Lamb's driver is getting better all the time," Fellows remarked.
253 The limo was now almost two blocks ahead, and losing it would take no effort
254 at all.  Sure enough, it turned several corners in succession and then 
255 vanished.
256 "Sorry sirs, I lost 'em, as you might say.  Where to?" the cabbie asked.
257 "The Hilton," L'homme said.
258 After a few more minutes, the cab stopped before the Hilton.  Fellows paid
259 the cabbie (with not a little grumbling on his part, mentioning something 
260 about his 'hard-earned money'), and the three took their suitcases and entered.
261 L'homme and Fellows waited to be in a sizable crowd before speaking.
262 "Just be glad, Farley, that what you discovered wasn't a toxic gas dispenser,
263 or some such device.  It seems that we've been discovered prematurely, and that
264 someone doesn't want us dead quite yet."
265 "Well, I'd like to wish our mysterious admirer a good day.  It's not everyone
266 who'll record your every quip for posterity," Fellows said.
267 Farley looked a bit white, unlike Fellows.  "You all right, Farley?", L'homme
268 asked.
269 "Yeah.  This is probably just what I needed.  Now I know how Ian felt."
270 "You'll get over it.  Now, let's get over to our REAL hotel, but not before
271 we take several detours first.  I'd like to make absolutely sure we're not
272 followed."
273 "Ahhh, a bed and a hot bath.  Gee, I wonder of NET labs packed my little 
274 yellow rubber duckie.  You know, don't you L'homme, how I hate to travel
275 without my duckie?"
276 L'homme faced Farley, and said, "It's times like this I repeat to myself,
277 He's one of the best, He's one of the best, He's one of the best, He's..."

288      As she left for lunch, Rera noticed that at least three of the 18 other
289 booths had been similarly set up.
290      Elseware, the first forray of a Jejkrekian attack group decended toward
291 the planetary capitol at Bideladu, each nova-class attack cruiser unknowingly
292 accompanied by a bevvy of single-ships running etherial.
293      The Jejkrekian plan was to take the capitol and gain a cheap victory by
294 intimidation.
295      The task being persuied by Lananaran space scouts was to identify key 
296 officers and battle-communication protocalls of the Jejkrekians.
297      Meanwhile Lananaran space traffic controlers cleared an approach for
298 the Jejkrekians as demanded, doing thair best to keep a streight face and act
299 intimidated.
300      As soon as the scouts had gathered enough to maintain the illusion that
301 all was according to (Jejkrekian) plan, came the first trickey bit.  The light
302 merchants, standing till now, patiantly by, brought the heavy sleep canons
303 with which they had been quickly retrofitted to bear.
304      When the Jejkrekian attack fleet finaly came to rest, in vacant lots and
305 other places quickly prepaired, it was with Lananaran crews, their origenal
306 crews slumbering blissfully.  As the illusion of continuing invasion was main-
307 tained, special medical crews removed the Jejkrekians to places of safe con-
308 finement and yet other crews, of dedicated teks, moved in to reverse engineer
309 and learn what they might of Jejkrekian military tecnology.
310      Of course no war is ever as simple as all that.  This was only the open-
311 ing gambit.

320      A shallow light shines upon the image of a man that is not there, it casts
321 shadows on his grinning face.  He is seen but not heard, his applause falls 
322 upon deaf ears.  Few people know that he is now not too far away, struggling
323 for his and his ward's life in a valley near a neighboring village.  The light
324 then fades, and the image disappears.  The projected mind had returned to the

329    The piper raised one hand and passed it over a small silvery globe.  "Is
330 this a crystal ball to fortell the future?" he asked.
331   The answering whisper seemed to hold a certain degree of irritation.  "Please
332 use both hands!" his strange companion replied.
333   The piper obediently raised his other hand over the small sphere.  As soon
334 as his second palm moved over the globe its silvery hue changed.  First, it
335 began to glow, the color deepening toward red as the brilliance increased.
336 By the time it was a yellowish red, it looked as though it had been heated in
337 an alchemists althanor -- the surface was covered with subtly mottled patches
338 of darker and lighter radiance.
339   The piper was somewhat surprised when the dark-cloaked one swept it from the
340 table with a contemptuous mutter.
341   "Let's get on with it!"
342   The piper obediently moved his hands over what appeared to be a deck of
343 cards.  As his outstreched hands became vertically aligned with the deck,
344 they began to stir, as though shuffled by invisible hands.  Three times the
345 cards riffled themselves, then a single card slid out toward the piper.
346 It flipped over revealing a figure walking along a precipice, carrying a
347 long pole, ignoring the barking of a savage dog.  As the piper watched, the
348 figure blurred, his clothing changing to a kilt and plaid, the pole and
349 stick changing to a bagpipe.  At the bottom of the card was a value and a
350 title -- 0, The Fool.

404      The substitution of one form of provincialism for another accomplishes, in

413      Accross the table from person, the figure who had introduced self as 
414 Gaurdian seamed about to stirr.  All during person's repast and subsiquent
415 quaffing, this one had remained comatose, as if the spirit had been sent out,
416 but in search of what?  From time to time, the body would stir slightly and the word castelian
417 would be uttered, but sense could person extract from what the outer ears and eyes could persive.
418   The inner eye told person only that the spirt was elseware.  In the INN's bustle, few others
419 seemed to have noticed.  To pass the time, person had been telling a story, or fragments there-
420 of out loud to no one in particular.  person sat back and looked around to see what would happen
421 next.

440 nosreperson:  Hmmm.  The above words seem to carry over my sentiments exactly.
441      Does that answer your question?  I hope it does.  That and something else
442      I had entered had encapsulated my feeling for the afternoon quite well.
443      You may not know who it was that said the words for me, but both of their
444      voices were clear and distinct; my voice is too reserved at the moment...
445      (in the written form of this guise at least.)
446 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (a slight continuation)
447      "Francis! Help me!" The young Master West's face was in tears from the
448 pain of the arrow that had struck him.  He had never known such a feeling in
449 his short life before, even the hand of dicipline enforced by his father could
450 not compare to what he now experienced.  Master West's elder brother rushed to
451 his side, his motions awkwardly following through from lack of understanding.
452      "Wipunxit, come to me," said the Guardian.  As his companion came to his
453 call, he too moved with some difficulty.  "Noone seems to understand just what
454 has happened here," he said as he clutched at the arrow that protruded from his
455 trappings.  "It is something I have not even told his father.  Here, help me
456 up, if will.  I have something to tell the boy before it may be too late."
457      "What have you done, Castellan?  How could you have done this to your own
458 Family?  What have we ever done to displease you?  Wasn't service under my 
459 father good enough for you?  You traitor!"  Francis had at last regained his 
460 voice after having seen his brother's condition.  If it hadn't been for the 
461 support he was providing for his younger brother he would surely have been on
462 top of the Guardian flailing his fists out of pure rage, not concerned with the
463 fact that he too was in pain.
464      The India that was now at the Guardian's side moved so as to be in a 
465 position that was between the angry young man and the one that called him.
466 Awullsu was now at the Guardian's side, translating for him.
467      "He wants to know what magic has made the weapon he released to have
468 two sepearate, but whole pieces."  She said this while gazing at the shaft in 
469 his hand.  "Was this magic?  I see no other in our midst that is also carrying
470 bow or quiver.  Tell me, please."
471      "Yes, but you do not know of it... The boy may, if he has been curious.
472 It all came to be by the power of a man called Edric."

475 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  One on One  OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
476    "Hey, Jenny! Get up here! Guess what I've got?" The shout came from upstairs
477 and around the corner but she knew that it had to be Allen. Allen and Jenny    
478 were both students at the same high school. He was a sophomore and she was in 
479 her junior year.
480    "Yea, Snoop, what do you want now?" she replied as she bounced gleefully up
481 the steps. They had become almost second nature to her now that she visited him
482 after school almost every day. The two were almost inseparable since they had
483 first met at the start of the school year.
484 "So, what did you find, Snoopy? One of your brother's dirty magazines or some-
485 thing?" She never knew what to expect out of him from one moment to the next.
486    "No! Better than that, this is some really neat stuff! Mom must have left it
487 up here by accident."
488    "From your mother? What could THAT be? asked Jenny with a raised eyebrow.
489 She turned the corner and propped herself up against the doorframe that be-
490 longed to Allen's room in such a manner that meant to say 'I'm all ears'.
491    "Guess," he said as he leaned back, lying on his bed with his arms behind 
492 his head. He had that devilish grin on his face again, something was amiss.
493    "Oh, no you don't! The last time we fooled around here in your room you
494 almost got us both caught! And besides, your mother is due back any minute..."
495    "No," he laughed, "it's not like that or anything. I just found a box of 
496 this stuff sitting on my bed." He pointed at the sack that was now on the table
497 at the side of his bed.
498    "What's that?" she asked, still not trusting his wry smile. Her eyes bacame
499 two small beeds, watching his every action.
500    "DOUGHNUTS!" he blurted as he sat up, arms flying out from behind his head.
501    "What kind?" She was still cautious. She was a picky eater as well.
502    "Maples! And some of the normal stuff..." His hand reached for the sack.
503    "No!" She took a small step forward.
504    "Yea, doughnuts!"
505    "The greasy kind?" She took another step towards the bed.
506    "Uh-huh, just ooooozzing with all that grease." His hand was still fumbling
507 for a loose doughnut to withdraw.
508    "That stuff'll kill you, you know," she said pretending to be concerned.
509    "It sure will. I guess you won't be having any then... Still want one?"
510    "I thought you'd never ask!" she said as she hurled herself onto his bed.
511 "BONZAI! I want some!" The somewhat reserved young woman had now become an 
512 animal in lust for her confection depravation. Manners knew no bounds.
513    After about ten minutes of face stuffing and small talk, the two sat back
514 next to each other, turned so they could look at one another. After a few
515 minutes of just staring a each other, Jenny spoke up.
516    "Hey big guy, was it good for you too?"
517    "Yup, you can eat my doughnuts anytime," he said with a grin.
518    "Oooo, don't talk like that to me!" she said as she squirmed in her place.
519 She said it but she didn't mean it...
520 They both wanted more than doughnuts, but now wasn't the time. Oh well.
521 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  One on One  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

525         As the words begin to flow by like water under the bridge I feel the 
526 warmth of sleep come over me.   "Humm." I mumbled. "That made sense.  I think.
527 Well at least..."   The book falls limply from my laxing grip with a sound that
528 never made it so far as to reach my ears.  This was certainly a time for me to 
529 unwind now that I was no longer bothered with the events of the previous day.
530 When the pages closed I no longer seemed to to be in the world ruled by short
531 minutes or long seconds.  Images and sounds began to form in my head, pleasant
532 sights and soft repeting tones that lingered long after the music had stopped.
533         Words written from tyhe gentle hand were the last I had seen (that 
534 night).  Ruskina had calmed me once again.  I fell into the most restfull sleep
535 I had had in a long time.  If only Ruskina could now see the ever fleeting
536 smile that was for the moment on my lips.
537                                          Piner.

541      Noone seemed to take much notice of the great white wolf as she nerviosly
542 manuvered her way accross the crouded common room of the inn.  Person was start-
543 tled by an unexpected nudge.  A shaggy white dog-like beast was poking her nose
544 first at person then at the still figure of the Guardian then person again.  
545      No he's not realy here right now'. person spoke to snowrunner as if she 
546 were scentient.  She looked back with something less than total comprehension
547 in her eyes.
548      #do not disturb the traveling one# Dreamtoucher sent to her as he approach-
549 ed the table from the direction of the baths, were he had last been seen many
550 eights of eights of days gone by.
551      You are one who has many forms and travels far' Dreamtoucher said to per-
552 son as he approached the table ware person sat staring at the Gaurdians still
553 form, a look of concern on person's all but unreadable features.  I
554      'I too come from a distance of more than space'.  
555      'Join us?' person asked, pushing back a chair with a foot, not otherwise 
556 moving.
557      Snowrunner settled to the floor beside the chair in which Dreamtoucher sat.
558      'I can see that your friend here has left his body and it may be a good 
559 while before he returns'
560      Dreamtoucher then asked the innkeper, who seamed to be near by, to bring 
561 two plates of raw meat.  person produced the proper coins and offered to pay.
562      'It is not my proper place to drag back someone who may not wish it, but 
563 perhaps, being a dreamshaper myself, I can 'go out' and try to see ware your 
564 friend has gotten to' Dreamtoucher quietly offered.
565      'I cannot say what is proper here' was persons reply. 'everyone has thair
566 own ways, it is all I can do sometimes to keep track of my own, yet you know 
567 your craft, and if it can nudge the flow of matters in a positive direction, 
568 that would seem good to me'.
569      Soon the meat arrived and person siped silently as elf and wolf satisfied
570 thair need for sustainence.

577      The activity within The INN went on as normal.  No one was upset at the 
578 presence of Snowrunner, for they understood that such was not a hostile, or
579 violent being.  There was concent.  Then Snowrunner showed a brooding face of
580 ever less understanding.  Dreamtoucher and person understood though for it was 
581 not an uncommon thing that happens in these parts, the fading of the body from
582 one portion of reality to another.  It is rare to actually see it, but the act
583 was not uncommon.  "The light then fades, and the *IMAGE* disappears."

594 Snowrunner/Dreamtoucher : Glad to see you again, for I thought you both had

596  we were all stuck in? When Piper's pipes weren't working and the car that
