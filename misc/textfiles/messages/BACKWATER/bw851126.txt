26 To: Questioner of previous disk, concerning measured phone service.  
27    This means that there will be a basic charge each month for phone service,
28 plus additional charges for the time used in the call and how far one calls,
29 that is, how far removed the answering phone is.  Clearly, this is a problem
30 for everyone, as the customer will pay for local phone service in the same way
31 as a long distance call. (Not the same rates, of course).  Anyway, those who
32 are dependent upon their parents for phone service will have their modem time
33 severely limited, and those who live alone may not be able to afford a phone
34 , (Senior citizens.)  I have just heard that the phone company abandoned that 
35 idea, but the local PIRG is trying to get a bill on the next ballot that will
36 prevent the phone company from implementing it.  I'll leave a name or a group
37 to contact, sometime within the next few days, depending upon whether I am able
38 to go to school tomorrow, (They're predicting snow.).  I have a friend in 
39 OSPIRG who I can ask about this.  If we can get most or all of the modemers
40 in on this (We all have a vested interest in keeping the current system), then
41 we should have no problem.  Measured phone service also inhibits all sort of bu
42 siness or personal communication.  Don't let them **** us over!!!!!!!!

52 (Part 9)
53         
54      My neighbor was at the door to bitch about the TV interferance again. I ran into him on the way out. I untangled
55 myself and ran out through the howling rain to my car, his curses fading behind me.
56      The engine was cold and didn't want to start. After five tries I was about ready to tear it out barehanded.
57 Finally it roared to life. As soon as I tried to back out, it died. I sobbed in frustration as I turned the key again.
58 Too late. I knew I was going to be too late.
59      I pulled out right in front of a truck. His horn blared as he missed me by inches. I barely noticed. I fishtailed
60 into the left lane an floored it. It was raining to beat all hell, and if somebody pulled out in front of me, I'd
61 hydroplane right into them. I sailed through two red lights, wipers trying in vain to keep the window clear. Finally I
62 pulled up in front of the main gate to the cemetary. I kept a folding shovel in the trunk for when the car got stuck. I
63 grabbed it, leaving the trunk open, and ran to the gate. It was locked, of course, but I scaled the fence with little
64 dificulty.
65      It took me a moment to get my bearings in the dark and the rain. The I found it. Roy's gravestone. Without
66 hesitation I plunged the blade into the earth.
67      The sod came up with a wet ripping sound. I piled shovelful after shovelful of dirt beside me. Soon I had to climb
68 into the hole to get deeper. The work was hard and my muscles screamed for relief. I worked all the harder, tears
69 streaming down my face and mingling with the rain. I knew I was too late but couldn't stop.
70      After what seemed like forever the coffin was finally uncovered. I threw the shovel out of the hole and planted my
71 feet on either side, so I could open the lid. As I bent down to grab the latch, I stopped.
72      There were voices in there.
73      The unreality of the situation froze me solid in my tracks. I didn't know WHAT was in there or what would happen
74 if I opened the lid. Then I went ahead and opened it anyway.
75      The body was just a dim shape in the darkness. I paid it little heed. What caught my attention was the CB by its
76 side.
77      It was on.
78      It was one of those little battery pack jobs. It might have been left on when he was buried. But why didn't it run
79 out of juice before now?
80      Suddenly Jennifer's voice came out of the speaker, clear as a bell. "Roy? Where did you go? I'm almost there."
81      By God I still had a chance! I picked up the thing and threw it against the tombstone above me. It shattered, the
82 pieces raining back down into the hole. My heart was elated. Safe. She was safe!
83      Something struck my left ankle. I fell forward into the coffin and screamed in pain as my right shin snapped like
84 a toothpick. I was laying on top of Roy. Most of the skin on his face had rotted, leaving only bare white bone. Slowly
85 the skull turned until I was staring into eyeless sockets. The jaw moved as if trying to form words. I forgot my leg
86 and tried to move, to get away from this THING but all my muscles locked. The chest heaved and rasping sounds came from
87 the puntured windpipe. Then I heard his voice. In my mind.
88      "You should have listened. You should have stayed away." Was all he said. Repeating it over and over. Cold, bony
89 hands came from nowhere and clamped on my throat. I tried desparately to inhale as I clawed at the hands but they were
90 impossibly strong. A black curtain settled over my mind and my last thoughts were of Jennifer. I wondered if she was
91 all right. It looked like Roy was getting me in her stead...

107 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\23
108    The entrance he picked was a hole about ten by twenty feet. Nobody in sight of this particular breach, which suited
109 him fine. A fifteen foot leap cleared the rubble at the hole's base, and he was inside.
110    The only other entrance in the room was a heavy oak door. James tried the knob and, of course, it was locked from
111 the other side. Who needed this grief? With a curse he lashed out a foot. The door exploded outward in a shower of
112 splinters. Those splinters rained down on a small battalion of the meanest and best armed troops he had seen in a long
113 time. Soldiers and intruder stared at each other, amazed, for a long second. Then with a strange battle cry, they
114 rushed the young man.
115    Chalk another one up to Murphy's law, James thought as he raised the sword before him. He dove almost headfirst
116 into a wall of razor sharp steel.
117    Fortunately he had something more effective than steel. The soldiers were hampered by the confined space. So was
118 James, but to a much lesser extent. Every time a blade or club was swung at him, he managed to be somewhere else. But
119 when his sword flashed, somebody died. The armor they wore was useless against its edge. Within half a minute most of
120 the troops lay on the floor, either dead or wounded. The few that were left stared in horror at the slight figure that
121 stood untouched among the bodies. There was an evil, insane gleam in his eye and when he turned to face them, they
122 fled.
123    James quickly followed. He couldn't just waste everybody in the place. He needed to find Tariya, and fast. Through
124 the darkened corridor he ran, coming out into a huge auditorium. This place had been pretty hard hit. There was rubble
125 all over and people rushing about. Nobody paid him the slightest attention.
126    An older man in a much decorated soldier's uniform ran by, cursing the cowards that staffed this outpost. James
127 thought he might have recognised him as one of the attackers from last night. The old man didn't see him in the
128 shadows until James' hand shot out and grabbed him by the armored coller. Steel crumpled in his fingers as he hauled
129 the man bodily into the doorway, out of sight of the public.
130    "What is-" The soldier gasped, amazed at his assailant's strength. Then recognition came. "You! But you're dead! I
131 watched the commander slit your throat!"
132    "I got better." Was James' reply. "I want to know what you did with the girl. Now!"
133    The soldier struggled but couldn't get free or reach his weapons. Finally he pleaded, "I can't! The Commander would
134 have my life if I talked!"
135    "I'll have your life if you don't!" but the soldier wouldn't say anymore. Time to get serious. James reached into
136 his boot and pulled out a small .38 derringer. He placed one of the gun's two barrels against the man's knee, just
137 behind the plate that protected it, and pulled the trigger.
138    The solidier's whole body spasmed and he held a scream back between cleched teeth, just barely. Blood gushed out
139 from the h}. He would have collapsed if not for James holding him up. In a calm, clear voice, the young man said,
140 "That was the left one. Shall we try for two?"
141    In a weak, shakey voice the man spilled everything he knew. In fact, he wouldn't shut up. When James had had enough
142 he threw him down the corridor like a rag doll. He didn't know if Tariya was alive, but he did know where to find her
143 if she was.
144    And she was with the man who had tried to kill him.

147 You can call me obsessed, but when you've got two dogs, one a puppy in the process of being house-trained, I guess you
148 might say I have a right to be.
149 It's this poop thing you know. Yesterday morning I woke up to that awful smell dog-owners hate. There it was, sitting
150 in a clump in the living room. I could swear it was in the shape of a smile, mocking me for having to clean it up.
151 
152 And there was that dumb puppy, wagging its tail, as if nothing was wrong. Dumb thing is so cute, it takes a lot of
153 effort to whack it upside the head when it stares at you with those puppy eyes, pretending it doesn't have thg
154 (the) slightest idea what it did wrong.
155 
156 Again, I might be obsessed, especially with such a gross topic, but it occurs to me that dogs are not very fuel
157 efficient. I mean, we feed 'em once or twice a day, and once or twice a day they deposit a clump of waste at least as 
158 large as the food they consumed! Just think if humans did the same: we eat three or four times a day, and if we had to
159 do the same, the toilet paper companies would be larger than Exxon!
160 
161 What do they do with that food? And where do they get their energy?
162 
163 My obsession is justified when you realize that not only do we have two dogs, one the aforementioned puppy pooper, but
164 another (his mother) who is in heat (we did finally get a doggie diaper- much cleaner but still gross). It's such a
165 pain in  the rear to unsnap the thing all the time that we don't let her out as often. So, since she had to go and we
166 didn't realize it, she went downstairs.
167 
168 I walked down there, and the familiar smell wafted into my nostrils, triggering immediate feelings of destruction-
169 minded fury.
170 
171 And there it was. A big glob of poop right in the middle of a cardboard box. The cardboard box contained some important
172 papers.  She was either making a statement as to the quality of my work or trying to hide it.
173 
174 And of course when I dragged her down the stairs to show her the work (I think she'd already seen it though) and spank
175 her accordingly, she peed on my foot the whole way down in fright.
176 
177 Sign me,
178 Pooped Out.

185      Like an elegant lady gone to seed, the Bogart Arms stood on the shores
186 of Lake Geneva.  Amid frayed tapestries and overstuffed leather chairs,
187 private eyes in rumpled trench coats and cynical foreign agents sat 
188 with newspapers concealing their faces in the cavernous lobby.  A glimmer
189 of recognition shone in more than one of the agent's eyes as Maria and
190 Mohammed Wassir entered the hotel through the revolving door.
191      "Mohammed,"  Maria said, "are you sure we'll find anything here?
192 Perhaps this is a wild duck chase."
193      "That's goose chase,"  Wassir said.  "And I think we were drawn here
194 for a reason.  While you were sleeping, I checked my sources.  It seems
195 that the famous cybernetics expert, Professor Hugo Stuffit, was abducted
196 from this hotel not more than three days ago.  The Bogart Arms is notorious
197 for intrigue and adventure.  Never fear, I'm sure we'll discover something."
198      The pair approached the front desk.  "Yes sir, could I help you?"  The
199 thin, nervous desk clerk asked.
200      "We'd like a room,"  Wassir said.
201      "And for how long will it be?"
202      "I'm not sure... let's start with a week."
203      "Certainly, may I have your name?"
204      "Mohammed Wassir."
205      "Oh yes, Mr. Wassir, we have your reservation here.  You've been
206 booked for the Vatican Suite."
207      "But we didn't...."  Maria said in confusion.  Wassir laid a hand on
208 her arm and silenced her with a shake of his head.
209      "That will be fine,"  Mohammed said.  "Would you like payment in 
210 advance?"
211      "Oh no sir, your room is being paid for by the Crudleco Corporation.
212 The note says that your account is to be unlimited.  Your room is 1313."
213 The clerk rang a small silver bell on the counter.  "Front..... boy!"
214      A twisted gnomish bell hop in a red uniform and pill-box hat appeared
215 from nowhere and gathered up Wassir's and Maria's bags and walked them to
216 the elevator.  As the doors to the lift closed, Wassir could hear the 
217 rustle of newpapers and the excited whispers of the men and women in the
218 lobby.  Yes, this trip might become quite interesting.

227 You've got to be kidding. I was laughing at the absurdity of it all... 
228 (sorry John,I don't mean to belittle your writing, but in my very humble
229 opinion, and as perhaps some feedback from one of your readers, if you're
230 interested... your story ended up to be pure horror, but started out with
231 no hint of same. Think of the movies, The Exorcist would not have been as
232 scary at the end if the groundwork hand't been properly laid- mood music,
233 greater and greater scares as time went on, etc. I think the skeleton is
234 fine, but it seems out of place in an originally CB love story that turned
235 into a ghost story that has now turned into a pure horror fantasy.
236 
237 Keep it up... just a thought... and now that I am in tune with your horror
238 aspect perhaps the next reel or two will grab better.

312 Another day at NET World Headquarters saw Farley looking glumly at a huge
313 stack of reports, folders, and assorted junk mail that lay upon his desk.
314 For the seventeenth time he took up a clean report sheet, wrote on it for 
315 several minutes, looked at it in disgust, crumpled it up, and deposited it in
316 the nearest wastebasket.  He sighed again, and reflected a moment on the
317 lack of paperwork he had had to do when he was on his own.
318 Thinking in this way brought, as it always did, back memories of his days with
319 Fred.  If only... no, better not to think about that, he decided.  Back to
320 work, such as it was.
321 At that moment, a large yellow envelope was plopped on top of the stack by
322 Jan Kendall, the senior secretary for the section of which Farley was a part.
323 "Important document for you, Eugene.  Ian wants you to read it immediately."
324 Farley nodded.  Jan sensed his mood and hesitated a bit.  "Want to talk?"
325 Farley looked up, shook his head slightly.  "No, not really.  Thanks for
326 asking, though.  Tell Ian I'll get to it right now."  As he said that, he
327 reached for the envelope and tore it open.  Jan left.
328 It read:
329 "Farley,
330    AL'homme and Fellows are on special assignment.  Your next field assignment
331 will be with them, so you'll be on leave after you finish that paperwork.
332 Let it never be said I am a slavedriver.  Enjoy Thanksgiving.

358         A walk in the stark cold air revitalizes a small sense of deter-
359 mination.  Unconsciously you are prodded to get to where you should be.
360 I should have been back at the Center quite some time ago.  They shall
361 not miss me.  Nor shall I miss their atempts to put straight the befuddled
362 notions within me.  Doctors don't know everything.
363         In the time that has passed since I was fluent at traversing
364 these horrid streets many things have been altered.  Half the buildings in
365 the downtown area are definitely new or different.  A few of the old con-
366 tacts might still be out there, several won't.  Driving here is a night-
367 mare.  All these orange buses in the way and the torn-up roads are far
368 from tollerable.  Orange?  what ever happened to the blue and the red?
369         Maybe, if I'm extremely in God's good graces I might be able to
370 visit one specific person before my time runs out...  Why do I feel that
371 the hours remaining are numbered?  Always limitations.
372         Well, I think this delapedated office building out to be the
373 right one if I'm not mistaken.  I drop an old knickel in the meter and
374 head for the entrance.  This won't be easy.

380 The doggie story reminds me of an experience I had many years ago in Eugene.
381   A young boy was attempting to give away a box of puppies on a street corner.
382 He was DETERMINED that I needed one -- that kid was destined to become a
383 salesman.  At his insistence, I inspected one of the little wigglers.  It was
384 warm, fat, and soft.  Perhaps it was cruel, but when I handed it back, his
385 determination was replaced with horror.
386   "No thanks, I'm a vegetarian."
387 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
388 That's a laugher. You got me p-p.

391 And happy Thanksgiving! And it seems to me that (although I'll be in town) out
392 of courtesy to those friends of ours on this BBS that a short moratorium (how
393 the hell do you spell THAt one?) on
394 long stories would be appreciated by those who are away.  Just a thought, in
395 a world full of thoughts, in a universe undefined.

419 
420      Fellows continued to read in amazement. The packet, now open, read like
421 a cornucopia of reorganization and redistribution. Ian and The Committee had
422 certainly earned their pay when they put this whole plan together. Not a
423 single department was above the sweeping hand of change. Field agents, always
424 the most elite in the organization, would be subject to the least variation in
425 their current procedures, but even there change was in the offing.
426      NET agent Fellows continued to burn the midnight oil and finished the
427 packet just before dawn. A note at the end of the packet from Ian bore mute
428 testimony to the seriousness the head of NET was taking this whole process.
429 
430         YOU WILL BE EXPECTED IN MY OFFICE AT 11:30AM TOMORROW FOR A
431         25 MINUTE BRIEFING.  DURING THIS PERIOD YOU WILL BE GIVEN A
432         CHANCE TO COMMENT ON THE CONTENTS AND RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS
433         ORGANIZATIONAL REORDERING.  AT THE END OF THE BRIEFING, YOU
434         ARE TO MEET WITH AGENT PARITY  ON LEVEL 7 AND PROCEED TO 13
435         WHERE YOU WILL WAIT FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.
436 
437      With the terse note still heavily on his mind, Fellows attempted to get
438 some sleep before reporting to headquarters. Instead of finding restful sleep,
439 Fellows found his bed filled with nightmares.
440 
441 TTTTTTT
442      
443      Dr. Macrobius' intense paperwork was disturbed by a pounding on his door.
444 Glancing at his wall clock, he noticed that it was only 7:30AM, over an hour
445 before most of the employees in the building he worked at arrived. As NET's
446 premier psycho-analyst he was used to such interruptions, but not so early
447 in the morning. Dr. Macrobius switched his door unlocked, and with another
448 flick of a switch, the door opened.
449      Macrobius recognized Fellows immediately. He had always thought him a
450 very stable agent. He attributed this level-headedness to Fellows' ability
451 to use humor in any situation. It was obvious humor was the last thing on
452 Fellows' mind at the moment.
453      "Please come in Fellows. Sit down and make yourself comfortable. What
454 can I do for you?"
455      "Doctor, I need help. I had a dream last night. Actually a nightmare. More
456 vivid than anything else I have ever dreamt before. Can you help me?"
457      Fellows pleading face made Macrobius pause for just a moment. He was
458 not used to such vulnerable exhibitions of emotions from seasoned NET agents.
459     "Yes, of course. Now tell me Fellows, what was your dream about?"

469 Fellows: Work is settling down, the great Conversion that has been the

480 Hours later it moved again, now a pulsing deep red. Transformed into a different shape
481 it now looked somewhat like a two foot tall octopus out of water. A large bulbous head
482 with one pefectly round eye, with two bright green pupils. Saliva dripped menacingly from
483 it
484 s large fangs surrounded by pink, almost human lips.13 tentecles, with small 3 fingered
485 talons moved constantly, searching, grasping.
486 
487  It inched across to the edge of the table and clawed its way to the floor. 
488 once down it moved towards the door. and then to the world.
