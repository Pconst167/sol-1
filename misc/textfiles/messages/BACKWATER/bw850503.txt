21   Another day, another disk, and for the first time in a long, long time
22 I find myself -- guess where?
23   Emotions have been running high for a while.  How about another round of
24 "treat someone nice"?  It's not really too hard -- we've done it before and
25 could do it again.  Ignore the ASCII graphix, the sly cuts and innuendos,
26 and try to find someone to compliment for something.  We'll always have those
27 who try to make themselves look big by cutting everyone else down.  It's lots
28 more useful to make both yourself and another larger by giving someone else
29 a hand up.  One person can only do so much.  Give another a hand and you share
30 in his/her success.

33 					          I wasn't sure if the glass sheet, that was placed before me and 
34 the world, was of my invention or was some trap fate had left hoping to
35 ensnare me in. It could be fate playing a hand in my life, trying to place
36 barriers between my goal and I. The achievement of all my desires and hopes
37 could be no more than fragments of a broken dream I'm trying to knit together.
38 It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that my efforts are futile attempts at
39 the bearing of life, my effort displays no significance in the final truth,
40 I play no hand in the craftmanship of my destiny. It would be as if the drawn
41 consequences of my actions are nothing in comparsion to the vastness of
42 everything beyond this body. It may not even be an evil force working against
43 me. It'd be no more than the universal laws that bar no exception, recognizing
44 no cruelty.
45           Equally so, it could be an unknown enemy of mine. A person wishing
46 power over another. I'm the subject of their superiority. They gain their 
47 strength and confidence through my prevailing weakness.
48           The barrier could be of my own creation. Like a child who has a 
49 mental block against learning certain things. Why would one want to inhibit
50 themselves? It comes from memories and influences from the past. The mental
51 blocks usually form as protection against pain or to shield the negativity
52 projected from others. Like everything else hidden in the crags of memory,
53 they are never forgotten, even when they're long out of use.

80                                    THE RUBBER PLANT
81 
82 The rubber plant, which I call it (though perhaps it isn't)
83 Sways top-heavy towards the window light.
84 Vacant nodules mark based leaves, dried up and snapped off.
85 It makes me wonder about the previous year.
86 Here, this empty hole marks the leaf which had
87 Surrendered its life after the first argument with my new love.
88 We bought the plant the day we moved into the apartment.
89 I remember her reflection 4 leaves later;
90 "Everytime we are negative our plant loses another one."
91 "No," I countered. "Its simply not in the right spot."
92 Ahhh, rubber plant. You graph the memory well.
93 1, 2, 3, 4...8! 8 vacant sites
94 Signifying 8 heated fights.
95 Now she's moved on to Europe and I sit here alone
96 Before you rubber plant. 1, 2, 3, 4...
97 The irony! 8 again. 8 leaves remaining.
98 Each one a bit tainted with the fringed yellowing and browning
99 Of threatened irritation. But you've endured.
100 8 majestic broad leaves crowding the peak of your lean stalk,
101 Perhaps awaiting my next love.

164 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (try to explain...)
165      The minutes that passed before the Guardian would speak his words to
166 the boy had elapsed into what felt like hours, even days.  They were not
167 easy words for he did not like having to explain his follies in the
168 presence of a crowd, no matter how inconsequential their numbers.
169      "Sire, is my voice heard to you?" he asked of the young Master West.
170 His words carried only faintly in the air of the late afternoon.  After he
171 made his way to the boys side he knelt to ease his pain having since 
172 withdrawn te shaft from his side.  Francis helped his brother to sit up so
173 as to hear what it was that the Guardian had to say, but said nothing
174 himself.  Master West only nodded in responce.
175      "What I have to say may mean little to you, but it needs to be told."
176 In the Guardians hesitation he tried to take in a deep breath while comp-
177 osing his thoughts and was quickly reminded of the pain in doing so.
178 "For to understand what I have asked is to know that I have asked for the
179 impossible.  A wise person would know the difference between what is and
180 what is not possible, and would not attempt to chase after that which is
181 impossible...  I am not such a person."
182 Awullsu's shoulders raised as a person about to speak, but the Guardian
183 halted her words with the slow wave of his hand.  "Oh, I may be knowing
184 in some manners that were before my years, but the aspects that would be 
185 apparent are those of which I lack."  As these words were being spoken the
186 young Master West released a small gasp, his body shivering in the shallow
187 breeze.  As quickly he could, the Guardian removed the soiled cloak from
188 about his shoulders and wrapped the boy in it while shaking his head.
189 "Such simple things as the consideration of others...  Forgive me."
190 ^^^^^
191 It doesn't take the alchemist to ask, but I also would like to return 
192 to another of those warm and happy days of non-hostility.
193 ^^^^^
194 I think the story I have put in (above) has been siting around for too
195 long without having been posted.  (Something like 112?)

230   After another pause the man a the head of the table looked over the material
231 covering the dark surface before him.
232   "How much time does this represent?" He asked.
233   There were glances between the other three men.  They had known one another
234 for a long time, and it took only a moment for a pecking order to be estab-
235 lished. 
236   The answer came from the man on the right.  Adverage height, average build.
237 The only thing that made him unusual was his continual habit of checking a 
238 small silver pocket watch that he kept in his vest pocket.  He was just return-
239 ing it the fine chain making almost sounds against the low rumble of the fan,
240 as he spoke.  "A little more than three weeks.  Sir."  The 'sir' had been added
241 a bit to late, as if at first it may have been overlooked.  He looked at his
242 cigarette pack laying on the table, but made no move in its direction.
243   There was a flicker of expression from the head of the table.  Unreadable.
244   The answer continued "The three of us, Mooreheade, MacDonald, and I were in
245 charge of the different teams.  Mine actually started a week earlier, right 
246 after the first incedent."
247   There was a grim smile from the head of the table.  "Incedent?  Is that what
248 happened? An incident?".  Suddenly there was a look of fury in his eyes and he
249 leaned forward in his chair.  "Did you know any of the people killed?"
250   "No sir.  Bill, I mean William Booth the previous section head felt it would
251 be better to get people who could keep this all in perspective.  Not get person-
252 ally involved, I mean.
253   "And you agree with that choice?"
254   "I, I'm not sure sir."
255   "Your not sure?  Or is it that you just don't know how I will react to your
256 opinion?"
257   There was no answer to that.  Again silence filled the room.

275 
   The memories faded and Arthur again awoke to his surroundings.  A 
276 
slight breeze wafted through his hair, and the smells of soil, grass 
277 
and trees filled his nostrils.  The air was warm; a fine day in late 
278 
spring, judging from the angle of the sun.  His heightened senses 
279 
were filled with it; birds singing, animals scurrying, hopping, 
280 
insects chirping and buzzing.  A curious ant crawled up his arm and 
281 
expressed surprise at the greeting it received from Arthur.  
282 
Apparently the word had not yet reached the most distant workers that 
283 
Arthur was now about.  Being industrious, however, the ant did not 
284 
spend much time but hurried on his way.  Arthur was learning to focus 
285 
his thoughts; a thing he had not had to do in the quiet of the earth.  
286 
   As Arthur revelled in the sights and sounds of his new world, he 
287 
began to sense anxiety amongst the creatures about him.  Far off on 
288 
the horizon, a strange object was approaching in midair.  Arthur 
289 
shrank in fear at the monster until he heard the "voice" of the 
290 
kindly old tree at his back.  The tree explained that this was an 
291 
object that held men and took them places they wished to go.  Once, 
292 
when it was a sapling, the tree had taken a trip in such an object to 
293 
be planted in its new home.  Men had called the object a ship, but 
294 
the tree could attach no meaning to that word before the ride.  It 
295 
had felt a gentle sense of movement for awhile, then the doors opened 
296 
on to a place entirely different than that which it had left.  The 
297 
tree failed to grasp the full extent of its journey until it observed 
298 
the ship leap into the air on its departure.
299 
   To Arthur, this object bore no resemblance to the ships of his 
300 
youth; large wooden boats with slaves or sails, or both, that  
301 
floated on the water, not the air.  This thing looked more like a 
302 
bird as it flew through the air.  The sound it made could only be 
303 
compared to the pounding surf; a thunderous movement of air.  Even 
304 
with the soothing words of the tree behind him, Arthur found it hard 
305 
to let go of the fear this "ship" wrought in him.  It was then that 
306 
the full impact of his situation showed itself; he was  sitting, 
307 
naked, in a foreign world he knew nothing of.  If men could build 
308 
such as he had just seen, how could he impress them with the small 
309 
tricks Merlin had showed him!
310 
    Arthur's mind reeled in despair.   His first impulse was to sink 
311 
back into the earth and live again as one with the soil.  The 
312 
crystals had accepted him as one of their own, and had taught him 
313 
many wonderful things.  Just then, the tree, as though it could read 
314 
his thoughts, began to rumble with a strong reply.
315 
    "Arthur, you are their only hope, and they are yours."

318         "BLACKOUT"    EPISODE 2
319 After what seemed like an eternity, he turned off the bell. "well thats that"
320   He said.  She then heard a thud from the other side of the elevator.
321 Had he fainted?  "Just making myself comfortable on the floor."  He
322 looked at his watch using the dim watch light. "Damm," he said, "there
323 goes the 7:28 to Forest Grove.  My wife's gonna be furious."
324      She suddenly felt foolish standing erect in the dark and she gingerly
325 lowered herself onto the floor.  The vinyl felt good, cool against her
326 bare legs, for the air conditioning had died with the lights.  She took
327 off her shoes, placed them atop herbriefcase.  Catiously. SHe was totally
328 disoriented.  They exchanges a few sentences.  She was worried they might
329 suffocate.
330      "No," he sounded authoritive. "there's air coming in.  These things
331       have to be ventilated--by law."
332      "You an engineer?"
333      "Bond salesman."
334      "I'm in mutual funds."
335     That subject seemed exhaused, and they spent the next minute in silence
336 Then....
337      "Listen," his disembodied voice floated over to her.  "I'm starved.
338       You wouldn't by any chance have something to eat on you."
339      "I think I've gat a Hershey bar."
340      "Do you mind?" he asked. "We could go halvesies."
341      "It's all yours." She fished around in her bag, found it, then groped
342 in the dark for his fingers, slid the bar carefully into awaiting palm"Thanks" h
343 foil.  The chocolate smelled pungent.  All her senses had been sharpened
344 by the darkness.  
345       "Hey...umm. You don't happed to have the outher kind do you?  The 
346        kind that has the almonds in it."
347       "Where do you think you are?!"  she snapped "In the A & P?" And 
348 suddenly they both burst out laughing.
349       "Well, here we are," he said. "So what do you want to do till the 
350        mounties come?"
351   Vicky considered.  "We could play ward games.  Ghost, maybe...or how

353    He was quiet for a moment.  Then he said,

362      Salazar shifted uncomfortably in his seat as Rommel's Lear jet taxied
363 for take-off.  Across from him sat the secretary, Anna.  The old geezer
364 insisted that she come along.  Salazar couldn't figure out why, but not 
365 much in this case made sense, anyway.
366      "Have you heard from that Albanian yet?"  Anna interrupted Salazar's
367 chain of thought.
368      "Er... no, not yet.  But then Mohammed tends to do things in his own
369 way... in his own time.  My office will contact us when he checks in.  
370 What's in the box?"  Salazar nodded his head at a large wooden crate 
371 sitting at the rear of the passenger compartment.
372      "Just something we may need at our distination."
373      "What is our distination, by the way?"  The conversation paused at the
374 Lear's jets screamed in preperation for take-off.  Salazar's stomach 
375 twitched at the aircraft thundered down the runway and lifted into the sky.
376 He wondered how he had gotten himself into this mess with a middle-aged
377 bleached blonde secretary as a partner.
378      "Oh, we'll get to that in a second,"  Anna said.  "Here... hold this
379 will you."  Salazar did a double-take as a platinum blonde wig landed in
380 his lap.

382      On the other side of the world, Wassir closed his eyes in resignation
383 as the helicopter hurdled toward a desolate Afghan mountainside.  The 
384 Albanian wanted to die in battle, not like this... so far from home.
385      "I think I've got it,"  Ming said.  Mohammed felt the descent stop.
386 He opened his eyes.  They hovered a scant distance from the earth.  Ming
387 labored at the controls.  The helicopter began to weave through a field of
388 large boulders, skimming along the floor of the mountain pass.
389      "Er... can't you take it up a bit?  We are very close to the ground."
390 Mohammed asked nervously.
391      "Hey, they didn't teach me how to climb very well.  I must have missed
392 a lesson."  Ming said, "Don't worry, I'll get us to Pakistan.  No problem."
393      "There is one problem, my friend.  I have a terrible affliction known
394 as motion sickness."  Mohammed's face was a sickly shade of green.
395      "Wait!  Not here.... Oh no!"
396 
397 
398      A few hours later, the helicopter handed at a Pakistani military base
399 outside of Peshawar.  Mohammed kissed the earth as they stepped from the
400 copter.
401      "Look at me... this is terrible."  Ming said.  His clothes were 
402 covered with.... er something.
403      "Serves you right.  Montgomery Wards Flying School, indeed."
404      Both men curiously studied several jeeps heading in their direction.
405 The jeeps squealed to a stop before them.  Armed men jumped out and pointed
406 weapons at our pair.
407      "Hey, wait a minute.  We're good guys,"  Ming said.
408      "We are very aware of who you are."  A Pakistani major said, "You will
409 come with us, and please no problems.  These are difficult times and my men
410 have no sense of humor.  Someone wants to speak with you."

454 It's as if sometimes everyone in the world is out to get you. I desperately
455 need a tutor in advanced algebra. Anyone? Sophomores in high school are
456 any of you? Are we alone on this planet reallly, or is there one single
457 computer running our lives? Questions, questions, questions. That is the
458 entire life. When do the answers come? Or do they? What is my purpose in
459 life?? I want a dress to wear and a chalet in the Austrian alps. I want tyo
460 sing. I was in Oklahoma! Just closed last week. Terribly fun ,yes. Prom 
461 night tonight, home alone, can any relate?  Oh well. Thats life. C'est la

478 OF THE INN...TURNING TO SIGHT IT WITH MY INNER EYES I TRY BUT DO NOT
479 SUCCEED IN LOCATING IT. NO MATTER, IT SHALL BE CAST OUT WITH THE OTHER

493      The "message received" indicator on the team's remote terminal glowed
494 softly, silently calling out to the operatives who had just unlocked the door.
495      "What'd I tell ya?", David said.  "Piece o' cake."
496      "Hey, Tony," Elizabeth called back through the door at Arjusk.  "I really
497 gotta hand it to you.  You've picked a first-class establishment here.  
498 Motel-6 always was one of my favorites."
499      "Elizabeth's right, first class here, Tony," David said as he collapsed
500 upon a bed with several large bags.
501      Arjusk knew that David's idea of a first-class motel was one without 
502 roaches, and considered the compliment accordingly.  He struggled with two
503 more bags, pulled them inside, then shut the door.  The light upon the terminal
504 caught his eye.  "Message in, Elizabeth.  Could you get it, please?"
505      Operative Ryan set down her coat and approached the machine, pulling out
506 a rather odd-looking keycard from her pocket.  Sliding the keycard along a
507 hidden slot caused the terminal to emit a short beep.

523       "Is it really necessary?" he replied.
524       "I suppose not.  When do you think we should start, guys?"
525       "Let's get a good night's sleep first, Elizabeth.  The keys to your
526 room are on the table.  David and I are sharing this one."

552           A VISIT FROM THE GRAND DRAGON MASTER
553 
554 
555 Dear Backwater Friends:
556 
557 It seems a long time since I've managed a visit to the Inn. My
558 new job at Children's Services consumes a great deal of my time
559 and energy. I feel lucky if I manage to occassionally download
560 Backwater and scan it. Today I lucked out. I've actually got a 
561 moment to chat.
562 
563 I thought you might enjoy knowing about Frank. You remember ol'
564 Frank, don't you? Poor perverted Frank.
565 
566 About two years ago I decided to try to get out of social 
567 services work. I'd burned out on dealing with
568 arsonists, perverts, child molesters and their victums. I was
569 tired of tragedy. I was tired of violence. I was tired of the
570 constant stress of working with volatile and dangerous people.
571 I wanted to do something else. I wanted out.
572 
573 I quit. I decided to make a full time effort of changing 
574 careers. I was determined to get out of social services.
575 
576 I was unemployed for a year and a half. It was a disaster. 
577 This is a terrible economy to attempt changing careers in. I
578 had made a terrible miscalculation.
579 
580 It was Backwater that saved my sanity. It gave me a creative
581 outlet to indulge my writing talents. It was my daily excape
582 from reality. It was stimulating to pit McKane Industries
583 against all comers. It kept my head together during a very
584 difficult time. 
585 
586 It became painfully obvious that there was no choice but to
587 return to social work. That was where my marketable skills 
588 lay. But was I ready? I decided to use Backwater to put it to
589 the test.
590 
591 Frank Jones was a character I created out of my experience
592 working with the victums of child molesters. I had Frank 
593 display the thought processes and rationalizations I knew a
594 real molester might use. To entertain those of you who enjoy an
595 intellectual battle I made him intelligent.
596 
597 Frank gave me a chance to re-examine the sleezy world I was 
598 contemplating returning to. He got me to thinking about my old
599 career and helped me draw some conclusions. The bigest of those
600 conclusions being that I really do enjoy the challenge of 
601 social work. It's the stress that blows me away.
602 
603 I was seriously considering returning. Frank gave me the 
604 opportunity to see if I was ready to return to the world where
605 the real Franks reside. I decided I was.
606 
607 It's worked out well. My job at Children's Services is 
608 interesting, challenging, and very satisfying. Sometimes I even
609 manage to have a bit of fun. 
610 
611 So in the long run everything worked out just fine. It was just
612 getting there that was so dreadful.
