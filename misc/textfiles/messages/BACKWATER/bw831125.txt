26 Chuck: If you are going to spend $60 on a modem, you might as well
27 buy a Signalman. At $69 you can get a modem already put together that
28 is the same design that appeared in the magazine. As for costs of
29 the other way, $15.00 for the circuit board. $17.00 for the modem chip
30 $4.00 for telephone transformer. $4.00 for crystal. $5.00 for misc
31 support parts. $5.00 for power supply. For a grand total of - $50.00
32 Other things you will need to add to the mess, some kind of case, and
33 misc connectors and switches to interface to the outside world.
34 One possiblity as I indicated before, offer the circuit board only, and
35 maybe some of the other parts. but keep the 'sub-kit' cost down to the
36 price you want and let the buyers finish the  kits off themselves. So
37 if you offer the modem chip and circuit board for $32.00 you have your
38 cheap modem kit. Though you would probably want to also supply the 
39 crystal and telephone transformer as well, as they are a bit difficult
40 to find. This would bring the price up to $40.00. Now if you wanted to
41 buy in qty 1000, we could probably drop that price in half.

43 PAM: Our trigger happy el presidente' is probably what frightens me
44 the most about the current state of afairs. Well, maybe after tonight
45 things will get back to normal again (at least I hope so) as this
46 depressive atmosphere is not good. Amazing isn't it how a movie that
47 hasn't even been shown yet can cause so much fear and depression.

58 The one world government to which I was refering has nothing  
59 to do with the rapture that many people feel is in the Bible. Personally I  
60 do not believe the Bible teaches a rapture. (wanna know why?) Actually 
61 the Bible indicates that the earth will never be destroyed, by nuclear 
62 war or otherwise. The concept of a rapture is relatively new religious-
63 ly speaking.

71 hi im beverly this is something i never thought i would
72 be doing gee this is so neat
73 too bad i wont be able to sleep after tonight
74 all these terrible movies about death and worse
75 is there any way to get online with someone
76 to get the bad feelings out of my system
77 after its over????????
78 hello all [ i'm ] just testing out the graphics capabilities
79 of my new term package { know what I mean ?? }  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\   
80 ~~~~~ ^^^^^^^^ ||||||||  ``````````  how many pounds is that ?
81 well I hope everyone is bummed out about the movie tonight, 
82 "The Day After".  After all folks, it is Hollywood.  I realize
83  the full impact of nuclear war, but....... there is more to the 
84 issue than a 2 1/2 hour docu-drama.  Certainly, it would be nice to 
85 go back to the pre-atomic era [ 1944 ] but we can't.
86 An it would be equually nice to do away with ALL atomic
87 weapons, but this isn't feasible either.  What happens if 
88 Russia, China, India, France, Israel, England, Germany, the U. S.
89 and all other the other nuclear {read-SUPER} powers dismantled
90 atomic weapons tomorrow ???  In a worst case scenario, Khaddafy 
91 or some other madman {Indira Ghandi} decides to "acquire" atomic
92 weapons outside of recognized, legitimate channels, without 
93 this evil, yet necessary deterent, the super powers would be
94 powerless.  International terrorism is on an enormous upswing
95 now, what happens when the powers that be relinquish their trump 
96 card ????   Tell me, if you were the individual in power, would 
97 you give up your position of power to let the ebbs and flows 
98 of time direct the course of society & culture ??  I think not. 
99 Remember, a sure thing is always more appealing than the unknown.
100 And nuclear disarmamant is the unknown.  Don't get me wrong, 
101 I'm not a John Bircher looking for a soapbox.  In reality, I 
102 am a product of the liberal 60's with a better than average grasp of
103 reality and a better understanding of current issues.  If I 
104 could, I would vaporize all nuclear weapons tomorrow but I don't have this
105 power.  And if I did, I would certainly think twice before using it,
106 wouldn't you ???
107 The same concept applies to first strike use of nuclear weapons.
108 Before anyone exercises the power to launch the first warhead,
109 they are undoubtedly going tto do one thing before all else,
110 and that is =====>>> they too shall think twice, or thrice, or
111 more.  I guess it boils down to public trust in those that weild
112 the power [nuclear or otherwise].  Without public confidence in 
113 the man that controls the button, fear and anxiety run rampant.
114 And after tonight, fear and anxiety will reign.  Reflect on 
115 this ---- we've had the capacity to annihilate the world for 
116 over forty years...so, with all of the evil that nuclear weapons 
117 pose, why are any of us still here ?????????          
118 Well, didn't mean to offend anyone but, I just wanted to express 
119 a few insignificant thoughts......

186 Alex:
187 
188     You want a different perspective? Here's a dif
189 perspective. When I was in grade school, during the late
190 fifties, the country when through a similar period of mass
191 hysteria over "THE BOMB". 
192      Every neighborhood had a warning system called Conalrad.
193 Once a month this siren went off and the whole nation 
194 practiced hiding from the bomb. Children in school did bomb
195 drill where they were told that in case of nuculear attack
196 they were to hide under their desks and cover their eyes to
197 protect themselves from shattering glass.
198      A bomb shelter industry emerged as hundreds of thousands
199 of frightened Americans dug holes in their backyards so they 
200 could hide from THE BOMB.
201      That was twenty-five years ago. The bomb never droppe
202 Maybe it never will. Who knows?
203      The thing to remember is that the odds of dying of 
204  nuclear war are about the same as dying from a car accident.
205 Now that's pretty frightening if you think of all the drunk
206 drivers on the road. But if your not terrifed of driving a
207 car why be terrifed by a bomb that is no more likely to 
208 hurt you?
209      There is currently a very sophisticated public relations
210 campaign going on designed to feed the flames of hysteria. 
211 There is certainly cause for concern, yet a time comes when
212 the rational person need turn from the hysteria of the herd.

217 BIG BILL:
218 
219      I'm too new to this board to answer your first two 
220 questions but perhaps the message above will give you a
221 clue to the answer to number three.
222 
223                        LeRoy
225 ***********************************************************
228 "The odds of dying of nuclear war are about the same as dying froma car
229 accident."  I'm afraid that I can accept that comment.  If there is no
230 war, you won't die of it.  If there is a war, I would estimate the
231 chances of dying to be closer to 3 out of 4, since Pentagon estimates 
232 are that there would be at least 75% casualties in a full-blown con-
233 frontation.  And while there is indeed a public relations campaign by 
234 the anti-nuclear groups, the consensus of the general public is based 
235 more on the attitudes of our leaders than on any campaign.  The Green
236 party in West Germany was originally an environmental-oriented group that
237 was taken over by the anti-nukes.  It still wasn't very popular until 
238 Reagen started making belligerant threats and foolish comments about  
239 winning a limited nuclear war.  To the people of Europe, this meant
240 limited to Europe.  Reagen is the best friend the anti-NATO forces ever
241 had, since he is almost single-handedly destroying our allies faith in
242 us and the alliance.
243      The fear has always been there, it merely needs an occasional push
244 from violent war-mongers to bring it to the surface.  Most have long
245 thought that nuclear war was unthinkable, and so thought little of it.
246 With our current attitudes on the national level, citizens now realize
247 our government no longer considers it unthinkable, and in fact seems to
248 welcome it.
249      By the way, why were there 13 blank lines before your message?
250 Rather a waste, wouldn't you say?

255 dear mike: $50 over our budget, and the members of my club are not the
256 type that are equiped to deal with half a kit. also they wouldn't think it
257 was worth the money. i was looking for something reletively painless, that
258 is something i could figure out and then guide them through all in the
259 course of one night of saughtering. where is the signalman available for 
260 69$ in qty of 1? i appreciate your help with all this very much by the 
261 way. but the thing that originally hooked all these people into this deal
262 was the poorly thought out PCS offer of $35 kits. since i can't deliver
263 anything close to that even with the large numbers of buyers i dug up, i
264 am obligated to find the best deal i can in tailor-made's, i guess. at 
265 this point i have had, by the way, people call me from 4 other cities
266 about modems too. i think what i might have to do is guarentee the sales
267 myself, put up the money and distribute the modems. i got myself into 
268 this and will have to see it through. anyway, i can appreciate that the
269 economies of scale are not going to be good enough here for you to
270 be able to get any lower. thanks anyway. when i have gotten them all modems
271 i will be sure to give everyone copies of your copylink handout. chuck.

278 Well gang the`movie is over, the world is still here and Orsen Wells
279 created more panic with "War of the Worlds."  Although the movie was
280 depressing, I thi~nk it was a real eye opener that will start a dialoge
281 world wide.  My concern is that the majority of`the people will side 
282 with the freeze movement and take the simplistic view that if we get 
284 that ain't gonna happen.  The people that will get the most milage from
286 the free world then they are going to hold the upper hand.
287     `   
288 This is the`same reaction that caused us  to bail`out of Vietnam.

305 Sure, the movie was a grim reminder of the horrors
306 of nuclear war, if anyone tends to forget. The
307 really scary part of the evening, though, was 
308 listening to Kissinger, McNamara, Buckley, et al.
309 afterwards as they tried to explain how rational
310 the whole nuke/deterrent concept really is.

315 The most depressing thing about the movie itself (not the aftershocks)
316 was that it was way understated.  Even ABC admitted as much.
317 There is no way that anything would be left standing after such a war.
318 There are enough Warheads to target toens as small as happy vally and Coburg.
319 I must beleive, for sanity, that it will never happen.  If it does, Please God,
320 make me be at ground zero.

425 
426 Okay, folks, here is some exercise for your gre 
427 y matter up there.  
428 It seems everyone is troubled or enraged not by what the movie
429 "The Day After" portrayed but by the fact
430 that ABC had the yarbles to air it.
431 Wake up and smell the coffee, people......
432 We, yes you and I, paid for those things..... 22,785 by latest
433 count.   That's 22 times the force needed to trigger the much 
434 dreaded "NUCLEAR WINTER".
435 Do you realize what that means ????  Referring to stats, 
436 (Yes folks, Carl Segan was not quite accurate) it would 
437 require on 700 nuclear devices detonated above ground to 
438 plunge the earth into a cold spell that would last anywhere
439 from 6 months to several decades.  Not a mild Oregon winter, 
440 but a winter with temps. diving to -60 below (and that 
441 would be in the warmer summer months). 
442 Do you comprehend that ?????
443 Using a lesser scenario, if only one middile penetrated our 
444 defenses and managed to hit a nuclear power plant, one would 
445 have to immediately write off the entire region (SW, NW, East 
446 Coast) and with wind drift patterns as they are, long term-wise 
447 the North American continent would become totally uninhabitable.
448 Fallout whether by nuclear warhead or powerplant meltdown would still
449 be as effective (smell as sweet ?)
450 So if one missile could spell the demise of the U.S., why do we have 
451 stockpiled over 22 thousand of the little beggars ?????
452 On another note, don't fool yourself into beleiving that
453 since we live in Oregon, we can backpack away from the 
454 disaster.   I've lived here 30 years ans fooled myself for a
455 long time with that belief.  I finally had to wake up to 
456 reality, however.  With the size of nuclear weapons today, and with 
457 projections on what size bomb Portland would be hit with 
458 (in the 20 to 35 megaton range), everything, that's EVERYTHING 
459 from Tektronix on the west side to Mt. Hood Comm. College would 
460 be obliterated.  TOutside of this initial (5 sec.) blast zone, 
461 up to Mt. Hood, radiation is projected to fall in the 560 to 
462 900 range per hour.  
463 Well, at least you won't need a skillet to fry eggs, you can do it
464  on your forehead.
465 So, what's the purpose of talking (typing) about this ?
466 To wake people up...... If the missiles leave the silos, don't fool 
467 yourself, humanity will CEASE to EXIST ---- PERIOD !!!!!!
468 In addition, most of the higher forms of life would be totally 
469 destroyed.  Estimates figure that even simple to m
470 oderately complex proteins, amino acids and RNA/DNA components
471 would be drastically altered if not destroyed.
472 In other words, from a chemical standpoint, the bonding coefficients 
473 of these compounds would be destroyed.  In other words, 
474 we would have a sterile EARTH with none of the biological 
475 units around that contribute to evolution.  Not only would a 
476 nuclear confligration destroy life that exists now, but, with 
477 high levels of U-235, U-238, plutonium, and the highly ionized, 
478 radioactive atoms of EVERY element, evolution would be halted. 
479 At least for 6 to 10,000 years.
480 Anyone wanting to check my figures & estimates can refer to 
481 the last 300 issues of "The Bulletin Of Atomic Scientists".  
482 So, no one will survive, PERIOD.....
483 What do we do now ?????
484 We can wake up and realize that the Earth is now a global community with 
485 everyone having a vested interest to STAY ALIVE.
486 What good will DEMORACY be if everyone is gone ?????
487 Again, I'm not a peace loving dove, although I'm not sure 
488 that is so bad.  I reacognize deterrent needs and the aggressive 
489 posture of Russia but..... have any of us tried to look at it 
490 from a Soviet citizens point of view ????
491 After all, the U.S. just INVADED Grenada, the U.S. also supplies
492 enormous arms to third world countries (Mid-East?).
493 Sure, Russia has the KGB, but how would you deal with a country 
494 that at the end of WW II, blew 400,000 Japanese away with 2 
495 atmospheric nuclear devices ?  Wouldn't you be a little 
496 unsettled ????   
497 Sure, after the war, the U. S. "paid back" Japan by rebuilding 
498 the country, but if there is a nuclear war in the future, 
499 there won't be ANYTHING to rebuild, nor ANYONE to rebuild it.
500 I propose that we should be scared
501 scared stiff.........
502 Then after we mentally assess the situation.......ACT  !!!!!
503 Whether you are pro or con ..... ACT  .... tell the people in 
504 power exactly how you feel.... or, you can become a member 
505 of a bygone era....... THE SILENT MAJORITY .........
506 We'll see who's silent when the bombs drop..........
507 Also, let's not kid ourselves into believing that the movie 
508 was truly representative of what really would happen.
509 
510 
511 Unless one lived right next door to a silo, there would be no 
512 warning...no civil defense sirens, no broadcasts, no town cryer..
513 Just the blinding flash and seconds later...blazing heat 
514 (7500 degrees F).  (Who says there's an energy shortage?)
515 After the heat wave, blasts of hot radioactive gases would soon follow....
516 Run fast ???? Not likely. If you see the blast, it's already too
517  late.  In that first blinding flash, you will have been exposed to 
518 enough radiation to kill instantly, depending on locale and conditions. 
519 So, why give a darn ???? Because someone has to... I've lived 
520 with this menace for 30 years, I think it's time we ended it.
521 DJJ earlier said it.  Read his message.  And, don't put your 
522 faith in Conalrad. The system is presently plagued with systems 
523 failures and is not presently considered operational.
524 Also, there isn't a standby or backup system, folks.  When it 
525 hits, we will all be on our own.  Any Jeanne Dixons out there ??
526 Well, enough good news, the bad news is that McKane (see above)
527 has also been charged with selling defense codes and system specs to China 
528 & Russia.  I wonder how long before they discover that 
529 SAC computers are driven by a bootlegged copy of "Stellar
530 Invaders" ???
531 Well, all, I guess I have said enough.  But do think about it.
532 For what we do not contend with today, we must wrestle with 
533 tomorrow....or should we merely pass the responsibility off 
534 onto our children and their children.  We've already given them the 
535 responsibilities of acid rain, pollution, nuclear waste disposal, 
536 etc.  Well, if they can't handle it, no problem... we will all 
537 be dead and gone by then....so who cares, right ?????
538 Wake up, America,tis spaceship earth is really not all that 
539 big.... and I think the time has come to kind of rake the yard, 
540 trim the hedges, clean up the neighborhood.....and.......
541 get our house in order, globally.......
542 Well ???? .............................

554   i have recieved a whole 4 votes. cancel the voting. I believe Hayden
555 Island is non-TRI-METable. would someone check for me? 
556 
557    ALL: am going down to SF for the week. will try to hop on a FTS link
558  at Berkely and give 'yall a buzz. if i don't see (?) you a happy
559  thanksgiving to all.
560 
561    ALL Aaron-BBS types: i have (after perusing the last 500 lines) decided
562 to go ahead with the system. will be doing some initial design this week.
563 any ideas-input greatly valued.       System will be 103 (300 baud) during
564 normal operation, and on special request i would be willing to steal the
565 103/212/3400 from my '11 for intermittent use. Located in SE (ok BAD?)
566 (private joke) Portland. Dedicated line, 24 hrs. Am writing the line editor
567 now. Remote screen editors soon to follow. Probably start with VT-52, C64,
568 and TV-920 compatibility for screen-edit users. Will generate other formats
569 on request. Contemplating supporting program transfers.         IDEAS?
570 
571     has anyone been in the place called "A Veritable Quandry" ?

591 Out of respect for those who tire of talk of THE BOMB I offer
592 the final solution. This idea is so obviously the answer that
593 there can be no further discusssion.
594 
595 Under every major city in the United States the government 
596 should build gigantic atomic bombs that can only be detonated
597 by a nuclear explosion over the city. Should an enemy attack
598 our cities it would create a nuclear reaction sufficient to
604 throw our planet off its orbit...killing everyone.
605 
606 Once this doomsday machine is in place the United States 
607 will dismantle its entire nuclear force. The Soviets, seeing
608 nuclear war to be obsolete, dismantle their weopons as well.
609 
610 No more platitudes...it's time for action !!!
