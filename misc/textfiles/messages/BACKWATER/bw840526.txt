40      ** ** *  MADE IT TO THE TOP * ** **
41 finally!  I've been accessing this board for over half a year that I can recall,

46 Quizmaster:I, too, look forward to meeting you.  Since I can't add anything to
47 the adventure until The Doctor says something, I've nearly run out of things
48 to say.  Still working on the character groupings (not much, on and off,
49 and I'm not sure if I can still find them), and haven'tr gotten anywhere yet.

51 Quizmaster: You are using a TRS-80 Model-1 (I can tell by the keyboard specs).
52 There are TWO "standard" key layouts. The one you have is a "computer" layout
53 the person who left the puzzle has a "typewriter" layout. The typewriter layout 
54 is becoming the most common!
55 	On another subject, do you want the answer to the group problem? Or would
56 you like to give Milchar a bit more time? Here is a NEW clue to that question
57 the groups given are groups 2 thru 7, group 0 contains "space". There
58 are you any less confused?

62 Voyeur & L'homme: I just realized that I need to give you a bit more info
63 about the shotgun! See that switch? That's the mode select, right now it's
64 in semi-auto. Push it like so, and you're in FULL AUTO mode. Watch out though, 
65 if you fire more than a couple of magazines on full auto, plastic cased shells

68 	Back at the clearing, Billy-Bob was looking over the carnage, hoping 
69 to salvage SOMETHING useful from the mess. What's this?...
70 Looks like a sheet from one of the bard's song books. Maybe we could trace him 
71 through it?

80 	The Chemist's Drinking Song (words: John A Carroll & Jordin Kare)
81 			(tune: Irish Washerwoman)
82 Paradimethylaminobenzaldehyde,
83 Sodium Citrate, Ammonium Cyanide;
84 Mix 'em together and add some benzene
85 And top off the punch with trichloroeth'lene.
86 
87 Got gassed up last night on some forfuryl alcohol,
88 Followed it up with a gallon of propanol,
89 Tanked up on hydrazine 'til after noon,
90 Then spat on the floor and blew up the saloon!
91 
92 Para-dimethyl-amino-benzaldehyde,
93 Powdered aluminum, nitrogen iodide,
94 Chlorates, permanganates, nitrates galore;
95 Just swallow one drink and you'll never need more.
96 
97 Whiskey, tequila and rum are too tame;
98 No, the stuff that I drink must explode into flame
99 When I breathe and dissolve all the paint in the room,
100 And rattle the walls with a ground-shaking boom.
101 
102 Paradimethylaminobenzaldehyde,
103 Go soak your head in a good strong insecticide;
104 Slosh it around and impregnate your brain
105 With dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane.
106 
107 Keep your methanol, ethanol, n-butyl acetate,
108 None of them work I'm to hard to intoxicate.
109 I don't consider a drink to be strong
110 If it's carbon chains aren't at least twelve atoms long.
111 
112 Paradimethylaminobenzaldehyde,
113 Methyl methacrylate, partly solidified,
114 Add copper sulfate for beautiful hues,
115 And drink it all down for those Plexiglass blues.

117 	At the Inn, a piece of paper appeared in midair with a pop and drifted 
118 into the apprentice's lap. Picking it up he noted that it was a song sheet with
119 the number 18 at the top.
120 	He gave a laugh, and placed it in his pouch saying "I see that
121 my friend's trap has caught yet another victim. I trust that it has been worth 
122 every penny he paid my master to fashion it!"

145 Bring me a love that includes honest lust
146 Warmth is for fire, fire is for burning....

213      As the people who use  the  Beaverton  RCP/M  regularly
214 know,  Dave  Morgan has decided to make it a membership sys-
215 tem.  For $25/year, members will be allowed to access all of
216 the  public  domain  software which Dave collects and use it
217 for their own purposes.  They can, of course,  still  upload
218 software to the RCP/M.
219      In fact, the more software uploaded  to  the  RCP/M  is
220 better.   At an as-of-yet unspecified ratio, Dave will grant
221 a certain amount of free membership time in return  for  the
222 uploading of programs.
223      For those people who are not members, they will be res-
224 tricted  to  Drive and User Area A0: on Dave's system, where
225 they will be allowed to download only the DISKMENU.DQC file,
226 containing  a  list  of  all  of the files on Dave's system.
227 (When you see all of the programs you're missing, you'll  be
228 sure to sign up as a member.)
229      Just in case you want to know where your money is going
230 once  you send it to Dave, he's not investing it in the gold
231 market.  He's going to put it right  back  into  the  RCP/M,
232 paying  the phone bills, long distance charges while getting
233 more programs and system maintenance.  If  enough  subscrip-
234 tions  are  entered,  he  might even get enough money to buy
235 more equipment for the RCP/M.  This would include stuff like
236 a larger hard disk, so he can store more programs, more Sin-
237 gle Board Computers so he could have two RCP/M's running off
238 of  the  same data files, and many other things.  The possi-
239 bilities are limitless with the support of his users.
240      The price is very reasonable and the  service  is  well
241 worth it.  Become a member of the Beaverton RCP/M as soon as
242 you can.
243  
244     Kim Flowers, assistant sysop of the Beaverton RCP/M
245 
246      P.S. Remember that the system will be open  more  often
247 than  it is now because the people who don't think the price
248 is worth it, will not be using it.  That is  another  advan-
249 tage to the membership system.
250  
251      P.P.S.  I  forgot to mention something:  these  changes
252 will take effect on June 15th, 1984. Send those bucks!
253  
254      P.P.P.S. Send your name, address and money to:
255  
256                 Beaverton RCP/M
257                                         
258                 Aloha, Oregon 97006
259 ========================================================================
260      The time is ripe for a Beaverton RCP/M pizza party.  If
261 I  remember  correctly,  this was suggested some time ago in
262 the shrouds of history, but I don't remember if it was  car-
263 ried out.
264      Dave Morgan's stomach is empty and growling (I can hear
265 it  in  Aloha)  and  the  only thing that will satisfy it is
266 PIZZA!  But it's no fun eating pizza by yourself;  you  have
267 to talk through it to your friend!  So Dave is declaring the
268 Every-Now-And-Then Beaverton RCP/M Pizza Party.
269      Now comes the fun part.   Where  is  this  pizza  party
270 going  to  take place?  And when?  Well, being patient, Dave
271 is going to leave that up to you.   His  favorite  place  is
272 Nonna Emilia's, somewhere around Aloha, but that is a little
273 too far for most of us.
274      So, if you have any comments for a place  and/or  time,
275 just  send  them  to  me!  I'll take care of all the sugges-
276 tions, write them down and when the time comes, I'll post  a
277 summary  and  we'll all take a vote.  I'll also take sugges-
278 tions on the suggestions and how the suggestions  should  be
279 suggested,  or  vice  versa.   Maybe  I  should  take  a few
280 pointers on my jokes, too.
281      So spread the word; the RCP/M is having a  pizza  party
282 and everyone is invited.  Bring money and suggestions.
283  
284       Kim Flowers, assistant sysop of Beaverton RCP/M
285 
286      P.S. Send your replies to me on CBBS,  Bit Bucket, PCS,
287 the RCP/M, or the PMS because reading all of the messages on
288 here gives me eyestrain. (This is a COMPLIMENT!)

296 Allseer: The gizmo is a CHEAP, DEDICATED terminal. We'd have to copy the

299 ________________________________________________________________________
300 ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
301 Since Milchar was complaining about me not continuing, here goes. (I was think-
302 ing about the best way!!)
303 ???????????
304 Milchar, Gizmo, Pand Psycho are all staring at the Doctor in a strange way.  
305 They are all wondering how on wherever theey are, this man can provide trans-
306 portation.  After a few moments of searching through his coat, the Doctor pulls
307 out a small object shaped remarkably like the Tardis.  He sets it down, and  
308 concentrates very hard, makes a few obscene gestures in the air, and it starts
309 to grow in size.!!!  Even Milchar is surprised at the is new revelation.  "I 
310 thought that you left the Tardis back in Amber!"  After unlocking the door, the
311 Doctor replies, "Are you serious??  I would never leave the old girl in a 
312 place like that!  It's a nice place, but the security sucks!!!  Now, everyone,
313 inside!!!!"  As they enter the tiny/large Time-Space vehicle, the two newly
314 aquired companions gasp in awe.  The Doctor rushes over to the controls in the
315 center and starts pulling levers and pushing buttons.  The giro in the center
316 of the control center starts moving up and down slowly.  The Doctor sets the
317 coordinates for wherever they are going, and hits the start lever.  After a few
318 minutes, the Tardis begins to shake uncontrolably.  The Docotor finally gets his
319 faithful ship steadyed and exclaims that they have materialized.  By some 
320 strange feeling, he pulls out the 'Time-Key Detector'.  It starts glowing very
321 brightly, and the Doctor bursts out laughing.  "We've found it!!!"  Milchar
322 turns to him,"We've found what???"  "It's the KEY TO TIME!!!!!  With it we can
323 easily defeat whoever's threatening the Inn!!  The only problem is, The Black
324 Guardian.  He's not a threat in himself, but if he has the Key to Time...."
325 "Great." mutters Milchar.  #Where do we find this <BLINK>??#  "That's not an
326 easy question.  So here's my plan.....
327 
328 ??????????????????????????? The Doctor, Milchar, Gizmo, and Psycho ????????????
329 P.S.:  Milch, it's your ball-game now......
330 ??????????????????????????????????????????? Us Again ???????????????????????????
331 While Greymalkin, Whisper, and the Apprentice are sitting around in the
332 common room of the inn the doors open and a fairly young man walks in.
333 There is a book floating in front of him and a small but bright light 
334 floating slightly above and in back of his head. He seems to be reading
335 the book as every now then a page flips over by itself. He looks up 
336 momentarily, glances around and then looks back at his book. Ale please,
337 he mumbles. By the way, would anyone mind if I opened up my library next
338 door. I like to drink you see and this looks to me like an extremely 
339 compatible place. Hearing no disenting voices, he looks up for another moment
340 and thank you, the first rule of magic is "Variables won't, constants aren't".
341 Wandering outdoors again his drink floating alongside him and occasionally
342 rising to his lips, he pulls five small stone blocks of an unusual shape
343 from his pockets. Setting one down on the ground, he gestures and the light 
344 floats down to sit just over the top of the stone and sjoots out almost
345 solid looking beams of light at precise angles of 72 degrees. The beams 
346 extend for exactly 20 feet and abruptly cut off. Pacing over to ends of the
347 beams the odd figure paces some more of the stones and gestures to his light
348 again. When he has finished a perfect pentagon has been outlined. He speaks
349 a few unusual and gutteral words. Stone walls shoot out from the small
350 stones and start rising up. When they have reached a hight of fifty feet
351 they begin to bend inward until they meet at a precise point seventy feet
352 above the ground. One more gutteral word and a door appears in the side of
353 tower closest to the inn. Be open tomorrow the figure says. Oh, sorry,
354 I'm THE LAZY ONE. Do you think something could be done about running a 
355 tap into the tower?

422 ............................................
423 Whisper: I hope that the others are on their way here. It is very rare for the 
424 Inn to be this empty.
425 ..................................the apprentice................................
426 TMA: I hope that Billy-Bob wasn't too inconvenienced? Look at it this way -
427 at least now he won't have to explain to the rental agency about the warriors!

439   WHEN DREAMTOUCHER CLIMBED INTO THE BACK OF SHADOW-THING WITH SNOWRUNNER 
440 AND THE NEWLY RECONSTITUTED VOYER, HE WAS TOO WEEK TO SAW MUCH OF 
441 ANYTHING OR TAKE MUCH NOTE OF HIS SURROUNDINGS.  HIS RECEIENT MASSIVE USE
442  OF SLEEP-SENDING HAD LOWERED HIS ENERGY RESERVES TO THE POINT OF NEARLY
443 LOOSING CONCIOSNESS HIMSELF.  MAKING HIMSELF AS COMPFORTABLE AS HE COULD, HE REMOVED HIS
444 PACK FROM HIS BACK WHILE SNOWRUNNER SQUIRMED IN TO SIT PART ACCROSS
445 HIS AND VOYER'S LAPS AND PART ACCROSS THAIR FEET.  IN SHORT, WHAT SPACE
446 WASN'T OCCUPIED BY THE TWO BIPEDS WAS FILLED BY LARGE WHITE WOLF.
447   TO HER HE SENT #I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED TO ACCEPT THESE HUMANS#
448        #IT WAS EITHER THAT OR WALK# WAS HER REPLY.
449       HER HEAD RESTED ON HIS LAP WHILE HER TAIL OCCASIONALY BRUSHED 
450 VOYER'S FACE.  FROM HIS PACK, DREAMTOUCHER PULLED STRIPS OF FAIRLY FRESH
451 RAW MEAT.  SNOWRUNNER GOBBLED ONE DOWN GREEDILY.  HE SAVORED ONE HIMSELF
452 AND OFFERED MORE ARROUND TO THE OTHERS.

456 WAS DIRECTED AT THE INN'S KEEPER.  "IF YOU DON'T HAVE JANX SPIRIT
457 WITH WHICH TO MIX GARGLE BLASTERS, THE LOCAL BREW WILL DO NICELY.
458   HE SAT HIS STAFF ON A NEARBY TABLE AND THROUGH HIS CLOAD OVER THE BACK
459 OF A CHAIR WHICH SEEMED TO IMMEDIATLY DISSAPEAR AS A RESAULT.

470 Whisper looked over at the Apprentice. Well, at least we'll have some place
471 to store the chronicals of our adventures, and maybe he's got a section
472 of that library of his reserved for spells. Is Greeneyes feeling more 
473 relaxed now? Hey Greymalkin, whats going on, I had the most unsettling
474 hunch that we were needed here at the inn.

477 "What's available for lunch." The lazy one says as he wanders back in. I've
478 got the house cleaning spells working and the box of orderliness is taking
479 care of shelving my books. By the way your all welcome to use the library.
480 I draw the line at borrowing the books though. Didn't get enough of them
481 back and its too exhausting chasing through the Multiverse finding replacement
482 copies. Remember Harrison's Postulate, "For every action there is an equal 
483 and opposite critisism."

491   THEMNAX HAPPENED TO GLANCE OVER AT THE WALL OF THE INN.  SUDDENLY
492 IT OCCURED TO HIM WHY NO ONE HAD NOTICED HIM YET.  ASIDE FROM NO ONE BEING
493 FAMILIAR WITH THE CAPABILITIES OF A LANANARAN SINGLE SHIP, THERE WERE
494 THE MINOR DETAILS THAT FOR ONE, THE DEFORMED WALL WAS PHASING BACK AND
495 FORTH BETTEWEEN ITS NORMAL APPEARANCE AND THAT OF THE SIDE OF HIS
496 SHIP!  SOME INTERFERIENCE PATTERN SEEMS TO BE OPPERATIONAL HERE.  
497 EVEN LANANARAN TECHNOLOGY SEEMS UNABLE TO STABLEIZE IT!  FORTUNATLY
498 THE ANCIENT PRIESTS WHO BUILT THE CELO OP SOCO REALIZED THAT THERE WAS
499 NOTHING INHIERENTLY EXCLUSIONARY BETTEWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND 'OCCULT ERUDITION'.
500 AS A RESAULT MODERN LANANARAN SYSTEMS INTIGRATED SPIRIT PLANE INTERFACING.
501   THEMNAX TOUCHED A CONTROL ON THE DEVICE STRAPED TO HIS RIGHT WRIST AND
502 THE WALL OF THE IN (WHICH HIS TRANSPORT HAD INTERSECTED) RETURNED 
503 TO IT'S NORMAL APPEARANCE.  TURNING ONCE AGAIN TO THE KEEPER HE BOWED
504 AND MADE A GESTURE OF OBESIENCE.  I UNDERSTAND IT SEEMS TO BE A BIT DIFFICULT
505 GETTING IN AND OUT OF HERE.  ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.  I AM THEMNAX
506 OF LANANARA, A COORDINATOR OF THE H.U.B. AND SERVENT OF ALL EXISTANCE.

525 
526 
527       Should any students trying to decide on what highschool they should attend next year, let me recommend Benson to 
528 those who are interested in learning an engineering trade.  At Benson you have many different shop areas to consider.
529 So whether you plan to be a mechanic or electrician or any other technical trade, you will be able to find a shop which 
530 attains to your trade.  Benson also has excellent academics, and the city test scores show that this is true. 
531 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
532 Benson Tech : You won the 1984 Olympics of the Mind by a technicality, as they added ESTACADA's score incorrectly.
533 Your place of 'second' should be third, just after Estacada.  If you do not believe me, just check with the OM office
534 or call up Mr. Clarence Bergevin and/or Mr. Bob Cutting, Science Department, Estacada High School.   630-xxxx is the
535 number to call....
536 (Ask for the High School [If you got the guts...]!)

541   GREETINGS FROM LORD MORBY, EARL OF BLACKPOOL...
542    One of the advantages of being royalty is that you can spell things any way
543 you damn well please.  I will continue saying "HOE!", because it is somewhat
544 of a trademark.  Time for me to join!
545 ...............................................................................
546  The door of the Inn flew open, and in stepped a man of slight stature, wearing
547 a cloak and other clothes of greens and browns in the classic rouge-ish 
548 manner.  He had a rather dingy look, but his personality glowed through the
549 beard and dirt.  He walked casually over to the bar, pulled his short sword out
550 and rested it next to him and took a seat.
551  " Ale please, just good ale. "
552   He rotated around and looked at the others in the establishment. ' A fine lot
553 ', he thought to himself.
554  " Bartender, I'd like for my dog to sit with me."
555  The innkeeped nodded his approval, and the man called his animal inside.  It
556 was obviously a wolf.
557  "He's tame enough.  His name is Dawg.  And my name is Charles Morby, son of
558 Olaf the horsethief.  Don't worry, I'll pay my bills."
