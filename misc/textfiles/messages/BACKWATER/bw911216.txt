 27 It was probably obvious that I was a wee bit steamed at the end of the last
 28 disk.  I still am a bit on the annoyed side.  I won't bother to repeat why.
 29 I would however like apologize for the tone I took.  I have my good days, and
 30 I have my bad days.  The approach I took was not a good one.
 31  
 32 Frustration can make us do foolish things.  It can make us hurt ourselves, and
 33 try to hurt others.  My personal integrity is VERY important to me.  I don't
 34 really have much else.  When people accuse me of being a stodgy for a boss 
 35 That I've spoken to maybe half a dozen times in the last 3+ years...  Lets
 36 just say it seems silly.
 37  
 38 It is very easy to be half assed in ones opinions and beliefs.  Information is
 39 hard to come by.  Fatigue is inevitable.  Our best efforts net maybe half the
 40 information we really need to know what is going on.  Caution and persoverence
 41 are good traits, as is the ability to change over time.  I pity you if you 
 42 believe that all the views you now hold are correct.

 85 There is good evaluation, and there is bad evaluation.  Guess what? 99% of
 86 it tends to be atleast a little bad.  Even if the intent is good, (Which I
 87 truelly believe ours is, I ought to know, I work with the people who put the
 88 PALTS together.)  the results can still be used to bad ends.  Our department
 89 passes out a lot of information.  Does it ever get abused?  Probably.  Mot
 90 Most of the problems are a result of ignorence.  We recently stoped reporting
 91 % scores for the PALT.  Why?  Because teachers were looking only at the 
 92 %'s  (Which are darned near meaningless)  and not at the rit score. (Which
 93 is an absolute measure of student performance.  IE, student A would be given
 94 a fairly hard test, because past performance had indicated that that 
 95 test was appropriate.  Student B would be given an easier test, also bassed
 96 on past performance.  Say student A got 48% of the questions correct, and 
 97 student B got 53%.  Some teachers were assuming that that meant that student
 98 B had done better then student A, when in fact, student A had a rit score
 99 of 220, while student B had a rit score of 205.
100  
101 The PALT  (Portland Achievment Level Test)  is a series of tests.  Currently,
102 They are given in grades 3 thru 8.  in each grade we have a series, the
103 number tends to vary somewhat, but is ussually around 6 or so.  Each of
104 these tests is aimed at a student who is performing at a certain level.
105 The goal of the test is to get the most information abou how the 
106 student is performing in various areas.  These areas, or goals are set
107 by the curriculam department.  The information is put into many reports,
108 including reports to parents, teachers, principles, and board members.
109 I'd assume much of the non student specific data is also available to the
110 public.
111  
112 The purpose of these reports is to help parents, teachers and administrators
113 make informed decisions about how they teach and administer.  There are not
114 intended to be the only measure, especially in the classroom.  Teachers
115 Have an immense advantage in that they know their students on a personal
116 basis.  They get to see the students perform, both in class and on assignments.
117 It is the stated policy of the R&E department, and I've heard it voiced many
118 times, that teachers and parents have to have the final say.  
119  
120 But, the school board needs objective info when setting long term policies.  
121 If certain minority groups are doing especially poorly, they need and want
122 t know.  PPS has started many programs over the years to help underachieving
123 students.
124  
125 Makeing informed decisions is vital.  Good evaluation is an immensly valuable
126 tool, but thats all it is.  Tools can be used for good or bad.  Throwing
127 away the tool would be silly.  Its much easier to build a home with a hammer
128 and nails, then it is with the nails missing.
129  
130 And as for me being articulate,  Thanks.  To bad I come of as an idiot in
131 person, sigh.

180   I'm glad the disk finally got changed...I've got to admit, though, the
181 debate going on between Astral Dreamer and someone who's name isnt' all
182 that obvious.
183  
184   We are all faced with an interesting daily dilemma...do we want to
185 be pure ideologues...or do we want to eat and sleep in a warm
186 place of our (temporary) own?  This may not be what 'Dreamer's situation
187 is, but the reference to having integrity questioned and that it seemed
188 to be connected to whatever it is that 'Dreamer does for a living made
189 me reflect on the personal compromises that we all make each day just to
190 get along.
191  
192   I've come to the personal conclusion that the small daily battles
193 are important, but if they are lost every other time it doens't matter
194 so much as the big picture: to thine own self be true.  If we can afford
195 to live our lives along pure ideals, fine.  Nobody should be blamed
196 if they have to make a compromise to get along though.  
197  
198   I wouldn't like to use petroleum at all.  But I gotta get to work.
199   I don't like the things that happen to produce electricity, but I find
200 them necessary.  I don't like trees dying, but I have to have paper to
201 draw on (I haven't yet found drafting vellum made of recycled materials).

203   I've lived my life honestly, though.  And I don't think that that's more
204 than anyone has a right to expect of another.

226 Hmmmmmmm ... funny story in the paper today about the Browns.  I'd heard
227 the senior Mr. Brown got prostrate cancer some time after the rape convic-
228 tion.  Mr. Brown helped me moved my compost down to my new place about 
229 this time and I went to his house to pay him.  Jackie was staying there
230 and was in a chair in a fetal position.  Mrs. Brown, a darling old woman
231 (looked much older than Mr. Brown) was very cheerful and chipper and offered
232 me a cup of tea.  I saw Al Brown repeatedly over the years taking walks in
233 the neighborhood looking very sad ... and he didn't seem to have Alzheimers.
234 What worries me is that I was told the owner of the gas station that lived
235 right across the street has the same name as a person convicted of murder
236 earlier this year.
237  
238 But I suppose they must KNOW what their doing down there ... hopefully more
239 than they know about neighborhood tax assessors, policemen, nursing home

294 cells, many members of Mensa, cute small fuzzy animals like cats and
295 bunnies, and the elephant's up and Washington Park.  Rumors that a
296 small dog once spotted on the corner of The Alameda and NE 57th Ave,
297 just under the statue of George Washington, cannot be substatiated
298 as the pooch has disappeared mysteriously."

367 Not an upbeat song, but it just seems to fit together so well.  I write a lot
368 of poetry, most of it garbage.  But once in awhile I write something that
369 really has meaning for me.  I can write meaningless drivel, but it feels 
370 just like meaningless drivel.
371  
372 I don't even always understand what I am writing at first, its almost as if
373 my sub concious is trying to communicate to me thru the words I write.
374  
375 It's really hard for me to be verbose in verse.  I like to get as much as
376 possible across in the fewest amount of words, to encapsulate some 
377 facet of my life in four or five versus.

379 Oh well, enough for now.  Its well past time for me to start writting

388 You DO have soul AD, so I'll ignore the pointed sarcasm in the last para-
389 grap <grin>.  And I'm sorry I was so rudely interrupted.  I had to hang
390 up because of the LINE NOISE, which if I were presumptous and paranoid I
391 think MIGHT be PGE sending power surges, but I don't so I'm not.  I 
392 will try to go back and "correct" what looks like gibberish above, but I
393 swear it's my COMPUTER thats SICK ***NOT ME*** <grin>....  so here's the
394 rest of the above story.  
395  
396 But who knows, maybe "Big Business" (or "Big Government") is buying 'em
397 for Ther employees, too.  I got wind not long ago of a local Institution
398 looking to pay $28,000 per year **JUST FOR YARDWORK ALONE** for one of
399 Their Benevolent Regent Figureheards .and THIS on top of a humungous
400 salary PLUS a free house (and god(dess) only KNOWS what ELSE).
401  
402 And about KATU ... In my own uttermost Humble Opinion, I think of all
403 the Channels THEY are the most propagandistic ... or bought off, or
404 whatever.  And I resent it that they think we're such insecure idiots
405 that we need the NEWS?? presented to us by matching pairs of "couples"
406 I also hated it when we were all forced into witnessing the "inside" of
407 their offce politics ... like when now Sleezecaster Bill O'Reilly was
408 Here and He and Jeffie would perform their great rolling of eyes over
409 Richard Ross. I got te impression they dd the same thing to David Apple,
410 but then I might just be to "sensitive" to these things, what with my
411 cumulative experience and 10 years at the school district and all (whee
412 I found these types of behaviors fostered thru Executive/Board/Union
413 Modeling and Mandate).
414  
415 And let me also apologize for repeatedly misusing the term "ADMINISTRA-
416 TIVE" in former invectives about PPS (and COP).  I don't mean to imply
417 that ALL Administrators aretic brutes LIKE DAN KLEE.  I refer
418 mostly to the Executive staff who Develop ad Defend Dominator-Type

464  
465  About the news: It doesn't matter whether or not the game is rigged.  
466 Complaining about the news being biased or the media's bias...either way...
467 is tantamount to saying "I can't think for myself, I'm helpless from
468 having my mind molded by the TV."  The truth is hidden, but it's not
469 impossible to find.
470  I watch the TV with my #10 Bullshit filter in permanent place.  I don't
471 depend on anyone to sort out what they tell me.  I listen to a lot of
472 Talk Radio: between Rush Limbaugh and Ray Taliaferro, I compute the
473 average and figure the truth is right about there, in the middle.  I realize
474 that people are greedy inherently; therefore, when pols and corp execs
475 cheat and lie and steal, I'm not surprised; and if I'm clever enough
476 that day, I can do an end run around it and save my soul and my mind if
477 not my money.
478  I also don't believe that everyone in the news business is out to lie
479 to you.  That doesn't mean, though, that I think they tell me the truth
480 all the time.  
481  
482  The only truth I know about folx who complain about the news being
483 biased or unfair is that they usually have an ox being gored somwhere
484 or the other.  
485  
486  On the subject of unions: unions are made of people, and people do the
487 organizing.  If you want a Labor union in your workplace, organize one.
488 Contact AFSCME, for instance; they certainly can be of advice, if noting
489 else.  Or, if they don't, just get the talk started amongst those you
490 trust for good advice.  There's safety in numbers...but the numbers
491 don't just happen. 
492  Anyone can organize.  You are more powerful than you think.

514    The city imprisons only those on our level who wish to be imprisoned.
515 I was money-poor, but broke free and left for another place where I could
516 reestablish perspective and grow in a worldly way.
517  
518   I do not return willingly to a prison.  If someone wishes to call me
519 imprisoned, that is fine; by the same token, I am not offbase to suggest
520 that the suggestion is very mistaken.
521  
522   It can be argued that we are "leashed" to something.  But it can
523 also be suggested that the leash is a result of a general lack of
524 ambition.  There are indeed circumstances that we cannot control that
525 are stifiling us.  They are not pervasive.  The trick is to learn
526 to discern between what you cannot change, what you can change, and
527 what you can avoid.  To suggest that we are all completely puppets
528 is to suggest that we shouldn't even bother to get up in the AM.  I,
529 for one, find that thought repulsive.
530  
531   Angst is fine, but angst is not all.  Man cannot make a difference
532 with angst alone, and if you know how, angst can be a fun toy.

538 In a dream I wandered thru a museum.  It contained pictures that were
539 scenes from my life.  I saw the sadness and the anger, but I also saw the hope.
540  
541 I saw the little things that brought me down, the put downs and the jokes.
542 But on this second viewing I realized they had no real weight.
543  
544 My journey continued for many hours, the pictures a walk of life.  
545 The trip a needed reminiscing, their scenes broad with my life.
546  
547 I saw many views within, to many, far to many.  The looking out scenes
548 lost amoungst the navel gazing angst.
549  
550 And then I came to a new place.  Construction, building onto it.  New
551 pictures to be painted, new images to view.
552  
553 I thought of the unbalance, and swore that I would try.  To look outside
554 and see the world, for someday I must die.
555  
556 The price the inner lookers pay is to always live withing.  To never 
557 live within in the world, to miss the obvious.
558  
559 Hid inside too much, too much.  These new wing of the museum must be filled
560 with the outside, but I know I cannot rush.
561  
562 The easy journey is taken and forgotten.  Seldom do we ever comment on the
563 short and easy trip.
564  
565 I'd walked into the present.  There I stood to wait.  Lived to long in the
566 past now.  There is no turning back.

613   Anyone has any Commodore disk drives that they are willing
614 to let go of cheap?
615  
616   I have a Commodore Plus/4.  It's a neat little machine, not as
617 graphics or sound capable as the '64 (no sprites and only three voices
618 for sound), but it has some good built in software (word processor,
619 spreadsheet), and I'd like to use it for personal projects...perhaps
620 even a bbs some day in the future.
621  
622  Only problem is, I've no storage for it.  Disk drives, I mean.  Or
623 maybe even a lowly Commodore Datassette...I could settle with that for
624 now, to get things rolling.  I'm going to use a trashy B/W TV for the
625 monitor.  Disk storage is the thing.
626  
627  Reason I'm looking for a price-favor is because we are a little cash-
628 poor after our move in from Corvallis and Christmas and all, and I
629 don't think I'm out of line assuming that there's someone who would
630 like to get rid of some old Commodore peripherals enough that they'd
631 nearly give them away; hell, someone gave the the Plus/4 for nothing.
632 It's a neat lil' machine I'd really like to put to work.
633  
634  WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:
635                    
636                       Commodore 1541 or 1551 Disk drive

638                       OR....Commodore 1531 Datassette.
639  
640  WHAT I CAN PAY:
641                       Not much right now.  If there's someone 
642                       Who really wants to get rid of thier

720 And since you're ALSO talking about ROAD KILL, I must admit that I **AM**
721 imbalanced.  While eating breakfast this morning, I overheard a conver-
722 sation about the teenager here who just got 6 rounds pumped into his chest
723 by our "unaccountable" community police.  I surely am missing the point
724 somewhere.

727 That case struck me as wierd as well.  6 bullets?  Whens the last time a
728 portland cop got killed?  Yet, they seem to have a tendancy to hose anybody
729 who even points a weapon in their general direction.  Gotta wonder
730 how 'profesional' that is.
731  
732 If I don't here about a firing, I'll be only mildly surprised.  The police
733 union in this city seems to have the ability to make sure that even the
734 most blatent incompatence.  (To understate something that looks a lot
735 like manslaughter, if not murder.)

764 He threw a knife at the cop, causing a wound that didn't even require stitches
765 as far as I know.  The cop then shot at him atleast 7 times, hitting 6.  Yea,
766 I could see myself doing the same in that situation.  If I weren't a
767 professional sworn to protect the public.
768  
769 The cop lost his head, plain and simple.  The kid wasn't white, so he got
770 shot many many times.  If the kid had been white and looked middle 
771 class, he'd still be alive.  Don't believe it?  Fine, live in your

780 day but I was never sure untay when my friend said he saw
781 a book dat VV with the picture othe secretary from the history
782 For some reason he didn't buy the book even tho' it
783 was only .50 or so.  So we hopped in the luxury car and headed on out
784 to make posI ran into Sherry some years back and she gave me
785 a two-block ride to the ad  and she never said a thing and neither
786 diI.  I really shudda thanked hnot that he wudda picked me out of
787 the ongs ... I look like a 14-yo boy ... or used to; but I used to
788 sunbathe on top of the parking str just because nobody el was

795 up as a bouncer for awhile at the Portland Center Red Lion, but I don't
796 know what happened to him after that. uhe once was with a small
797 gang oguys standing in front the PSPE bldg and I was walking hom
798 to the apt. next door when they whistled at me.  Well, you know how 
799 THAT goes.It's so damn irritating, then embarrass ... especially
800 when you're damned if you do and damned if you don't respond.  So when
801 I didn't, they started throwing rocks.  THank god my friend was

806 Ah, AD, getting a little snippy, aren't we.  I'll try to hold my
807 temper and not reply in kind, though you'll have to excuse me if
808 I don't take your 'interpretation' of events as gospel.  I assume
809 you got your info from the Oregonian, a questionable source at
810 best.  If you'd care to quote court documents, that
811 would be fine.
812  
813 I hear you saying that the standard of care should be different for
814 you from a police officer in a shooting situation.  Although there
815 are differences in the law regarding the use of deadly force between
816 normal citizens and law enforcement officers, in this case, the
817 standard is the same.  A police officer (or citizen) may use deadly
818 physical force if threatened with serious physical injury.  The courts
819 have held that what is important is the perception of the threat by
820 the officer at the time of the use of force.  There are several examples
821 of police officers shooting people wielding unloaded weapons.  There is
822 no requirement that the officer say "Excuse me sir, do you mind if I
823 check the gun that you're pointing at me to see if it's loaded before
824 I shoot you?"  Nor is there a requirement that the officer wait to 
825 see how seriously he is injured (your number of stitches argument)
826 before using deadly force.  The courts have also held numerous times
827 that being threatened with a knife is a threat of serious physical
828 injury.
829  
830 I guess my point is that unless you're standing in that particular officer's
831 shoes, it's difficult for you to pontificate about whether the shooting
832 was righteous or not.  That's what a court of law is for.  I assume that
833 if the officer was wrong, then the courts will so rule.  Sometimes we
834 make life and death decisions in a split second then live with the results
835 for the rest of our lives.  
836

841 I apologize.  I was abusive, and without good reason.  
842  
843 Yes, I did get my info from the Oregonian, not a great source I know, but
844 the only one available right now.  I'm sure there is an investigation going
845 on, but I'd be very much surprised if the records were available to the
846 public at this time.
847  
848 The way it was portrayed in the Oregonian was as follows.  Cop stops car,
849 copy asks suspect to get out of car.  suspect gets out of car and throws
850 knife at cop.  At this point suspect has no weapons in hands.  Cop fires
851 seven bullets.  Cop hits suspect 6 times.
852  
853 In my book, thats excessive force.  Maybe it didn't happen that way.  We'll
854 find out in a few months no doubt.
855  
856 If the kid had been waving a gun, I'd say he got what he deserved.  
857  
858 I thank you for your restraint.  Its good to see somebody setting a good
859 example.  I will do the same in the future.

865   I admire 'Dreamer's wherwithal to concede the last point.  I, myself, did
866 a lot of thinking and info gathering WRT to the kid who got killed in the
867 altercation with the Law.
868   Sure, it shouldn't have happened.  I am, however, respectfully withholding
869 my sorrow.  The family should rightly grieve, but I won't.  The kid was
870 stupid.  I understand he had a history of getting into trouble that people
871 with real IQ's would avoid (and don't give me the environmental crap.  Smart
872 people stay out of trouble.  Successes come out of the get-toe every day.
873 I think of it as evolution in action), and then he goes, robs a store, and 
874 then when stopped, comes out and stabs a man who is armed to the teeth and
875 trained to (and this is important) DEFEND HIMSELF WHEN ATTACKED.
876  
877   Stupid.
878  
879   Let me put it to you this way: if you're stupid enough to come after me
880 with a knife if I were armed with a sidearm, you'd be lucky if they found
881 one of your short hairs to bury.  Or, another way: a buffoon who pokes
882 a tiger with a stick may not deserve to die, only to be tapped back with a
883 stick.  
884   But you think he's gonna be tapped back with a lil' ol' stick?  If you
885 said to yourself, "heck, no, Justin, he's gonna die horribly," then the
886 light just may be coming on in your head.  Congratulations.
