58 All: the 'cipher' msg on DB (with the 01 border) is *not* from me. As 
59 has been stated before NET no longer posts cipher to this board. Any
60 ciphertext purporting to be from a member of NET is *bogus*!
61 ///: I did read Mr. Michael's signature, what I was referring to was
62 the *previous* posting... And if I say that I haven't had time or 
63 have not gotten around to it, it means JUST THAT! Not that it was too
64 hard (or that I was too dumb). 
65 Why don't *you* enlighten us by translating it? (of course if it is
66 enciphered in the same manner as the signature then it is a trivial 
67 exercise)(No, I haven't bothered going back to check yet...)

83     To the person who wondered if the system had been purged recently,
84 BWMS uses two disk drives to operate on. The first disk, DA, is the one
85 each new caller is placed on. The second disk is where old disks are put
86 once they are just about full, and it is called DB. DA and DB are
87 commands in BWMS, just as EN, TO, BO, UP, and DO are commands. You can
88 switch between the disks to see what has gone by recently!

91 
92   NET does not crash systems. For those who do not know, NET used to
93 find the names of people who would vandalize the open nature of BWMS
94 and ask them to stop. The members did employ some intricate means and
95 sly methods to figure out who was who. In becoming so sophisticated at
96 figuring out who was who, they found they had a better handle on what
97 was going on than other users. Enthusiastic about their skill, they
98 started to write stories. Their stories were spy stories, although
99 each had written some parts of stories to do with the Inn before. For
100 the most part, NET has vanished. You might suppose they either tired
101 of deducing who was whom, or they might have tired of writing the
102 stories, but most of all, their encoded notes might have gone on to
103 more secret routes of exchange.
104   Suffice it to say, the time when NET had anything to do with BWMS
105 is over. I dare say the larger number of the NET operatives, and of
106 BakcWater users in general, wish the subject would remain unspoken of
107 for a long time. In keeping with these wishes, could you please not
108 broach the sucject any further?
109   Thanks in advance,

113 HOW TO DRAW A BALL
114 Simple and Common
115 A ball is the simplest solid. It has the minimal surface for a given volume
116 and it can be specified by one location (centre) and one length (radius).
117 It is the fundamental shape of almost all large objects in the universe,
118 such as the sun, moon, and stars. We begin as a ball, we live on a ball,
119 and a ball is one of the earliest and commonest toys.
120 Hard to Draw
121 Notwithstanding its simplicity and ubiquity, a ball is quite hard to draw.
122 This is because our drawing techniques are essentially linear. We can
123 easily represent profiles (outlines) and sharp edges by lines, but curved
124 surfaces are something of a problem. Their varying light and shade call for
125 some additional tonal variation in the representation, such as hatching or
126 painting.

129 (* IIIIIIIVVVIVIIVIIIIX (*) IXVIIIVIIVIVIVIIIIII *)
130 The old woman walked slowly out of the pond, shivering violently as
131 the cool breeze dried the water clinging to her body.  She was
132 resenting everything about this persona--its aches and pains, time-
133 worn features, and tired thoughts.  It was especially difficult to
134 return to it after the pleasant, lazy days she had spent at the
135 temple, chasing rodents and sleeping in the sun.
136      She climbed the bank and looked under the willow tree for the
137 clothing she had left there.  The twinge of pain she felt in her back
138 when she bent over was the deciding factor.  I will not remain in this
139 persona, she thought.  I don't care if it's dangerous to change again
140 so quickly, I have done it before and it didn't kill me.  Enough time
141 has passed, it should be safe to become the dancer again.  I'll go
142 back to that Inn and maybe this time I will find someone to take me
143 off-world to a new destination.
144      She stiffly moved into a cross-legged position on the clothing,
145 and cleared her mind.  She prefaced the invocation of Hobeth with a
146 prayer.  "Hobeth, Goddess, First of All, please look kindly upon your
147 daughter.  Her actions this day are not undertaken lightly.  They are
148 not meant as an abuse of the power which you bestowed upon her, but
149 are done that she may continue to enjoy the rich and varied life which
150 you have provided."  So saying, she began the vows of the shape-
151 changers and entered into the trance of transformation.
152      Her preparations were swiftly accomplished since she did not have
153 to envision a new destination, just the various aspects of the dancer
154 persona.  She felt the long hair sliding across her shoulders and down
155 her back, the sure and graceful movements of the trained body, and
156 heard the quick-silver laughter of dancer's exuberant spirit.  She was
157 ready.
158      She arose slowly and walked back into the water she had so
159 recently left.  Just a few seconds after the white hair disappeared
160 from sight under the water, it seemed to reappeared, heading back
161 towards the shore.  But if anyone had been observing the scene, they
162 would not say that the two people had anything in common other than
163 gender and hair color.  The woman walking out of the water had long
164 white hair which hung down and covered but did not completely obscure
165 the voluptuous contours of her upper torso.  Her legs were long and
166 well muscled, and she moved with the grace of a trained athlete.
167      This time she barely noticed the breeze drying her skin.  She
168 felt vital and full of life, anticipating her next destination and the
169 people she would meet along the way.  When she got to the pile of
170 clothing she looked at it with distaste.  It might have been adequate
171 for the crone, but to the dancer it looked like a bundle of rags.
172 Sighing with resignation, she picked up the clothes and put them on.
173 Actually this might work to my advantage, she thought.  It does make
174 me look poor and may help to convince someone that I really am in need
175 of help.
176      She combed her fingers through her wet hair, and pushed into
177 placed as best she could.  Her step was buoyant as she headed back to
178 the Inn.

191 	A note of explanation:  To expand on someone`s explanation of the
192 NET`s activities, let us not forget that they also stalked some regular
193 users of the Inn also.  Their crime?  A willingness to contribute and a
194 desire for privacy.  Some of us would like to forget that outrage, but it
195 is difficult.
196 
197 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
198 Bullshit.  NET never hassled anyone who left any socially redeeming entry
199 whatsoever.  They certainly did however actively resent anyone who attempted
200 to claim NET status fallaciously.

203 mike may i use the replace line or delete line feature of the diskwriter?
204 i now have a complete list of commands & the manual. shall i do a file
205 compression after deleting a garbled line of mine? i would put the status
206 back to "enter only" after i am done. i only wanted to do this when i
207 mess up in entering a message, if it's okay with you.

211 Devotee:  I would beg to differ with you.  I know of one person that was
212 tracked down by the NET.  She never claimed NET status, nor did she go
213 out of her way to do anything against the NET.  As I said before, her 
214 only crime was to value her privacy.  
215 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
216 If you are referring to the lady I think you are, it wasn't NET that went
217 after her. It was a couple of the more immature *members* of NET. A small
218 but very important difference.
219 Certain NET agents *still* have a lot of 'growing up' to do...

223      There periodically comes a time in an individual's life when 
224 a  branch  in the path we take sits in front of us.   A  decision 
225 must be made which direction to go.  Do we take the left fork  or 
226 the right one? 
227      One path was familar, it was a continuation of the very path 
228 I was currently following.  But I could no longer see its length, 
229 it  was dark and crowded,  overgrown with vegitation.   The other 
230 path was no better,  a haze covered it only a short distance from 
231 where I stood. 
232      I don't know which direction to go.  Do I continue to try to 
233 fight  my way in the direction I have been going?   The  way  has 
234 been  getting  rougher and more difficult with each step I  take.  
235 It has been a great struggle just to move. 
236      The other path becons to me.   It is an easier way.   But is 
237 it really?   What lies beyond the mists?   It does not go in  the 
238 direction I have been heading, and if I take this new path I must 
239 abandon my determined journey.  
240      The  majestic castle twinkles at me on the distant mountain.  
241 It calls to me to continue my fight,  and the brambles and  weeds 
242 in the path entangle themselves about my limbs,  they stop me and 
243 tell me to go away.  
244      The mists simply present a cold and unknowing wall obscuring 
245 the  way.  What  should I do?   I've spent so long  stuggling  to 
246 achieve the grandure of the castle,  with each step I think  that 
247 things must get easier soon.   And with each step it only becomes 
248 more difficult, more distant.  
249      Should I give up?  Should I stop trying to reach a goal that 
250 only  seems  to slip away further the closer I try to  get?   And 
251 what of the other path?   I know nothing of it,  I know not where 
252 it  leads.   I don't even know if it leads anywhere.   For all  I 
253 know,  it could stop dead just around that bend.  Or is it even a 
254 path to anywhere?   I don't even know that.  I don't even know if 
255 it is a path at all.  
256      The  way I have been traveling has become so difficult  that 
257 anything less difficult is an alternate path.  And still there is 
258 that  feeling in my breast that the way may become easier in only 
259 a short distance, that all I have to do is stick it out. 
260      But to what end?   I'm not even sure if I know the  original 
261 reason  for  following this path now.   Only my  destination  has 
262 offered a guiding influence,  a glistening light to show the way.  
263 But I don't know what I'll find when I get there or why I want to 
264 go there anymore.
265      Warmth,    security,   happiness,   merryment,   friendship, 
266 knowledge, faith, all things we look for.  But is this the reason 
267 for the path I have followed for so long?   Is this what I expect 
268 to find?  Is it even there to be found?  
269      Should I turn away,  let the dark forest have its way?  Stop 
270 this  seemingly endless trek that goes on and on?   Should I turn 
271 aside and travel a different path?  
272      I wish I knew what to do.   I wish I knew what was the  best 
273 course.  I wish I knew...

284 by the way, here's the code i was talking about:
285 5 rem encode text by alternate position coding
286 10 line input a$
287 20 l=len(a$)
288 b$=""
289 40 if l mod 2 then a$=a$+" ":l=l+1
290 50 print chr$(34);a$;chr$(34)
291 60 print chr$(34);
292 70 for x=0 to l/2-1
293 80        b$=b$+mid$(a$,x+1,1)+mid$(s$,l-x,1)
294 90 next
295 100 print b$;chr$(34)
296 
297 
298 
299 5 rem decode text by alternate position decoding
300 10 line input a$
301 20 l=len(a$)
302 30b$=""
303 40 if l mod 2 then print "user error: text length not right. try again.":goto 10
304 50 print chr$(34);a$;chr$(34)
305 60 print chr$(34);
306 70 for x=1 to l step 2
307 80 b$=b$+mid$(a$,x,1)
308 90 next
309 100 for x=l to 1 step -2
310 110b$=b$+mid$(a$,x,1)
311 120 next
312 130 print b$;chr$(34)
313 
314 
315 
316 if you wonder what "line input a$" is, it is like "input a$" except that
317 it accepts commas, colons, quotes, etc.
318 told you it was simple. the "mod" statement can also come in handy...i.e.
319 input a$:for x=1 to len(a$):m=asc(mid$(a$,x,1))
320 m=m+1
321 30 if m>255 then m=m-256:goto 30
322 b$=b$+chr$(m):next
323 
324 
325 
326 could become...
327 
328 
329 oops, i noticed a mistake. "m=m+1" should be "m=m+x"...
330 
331 
332 
333 input a$:for x=1 to len(a$):b$=b$+chr$((asc(mid$(a$,x,1))+x) mod 255):next
334 
335 
336 i wonder what would happen if i mixed all he encoding schemes together that
337 are known to man up to this day... would it be possible?

NO CARRIER
346 My understand of this 'net' stuff is that 'net' was merely a fictional spy
347 organization that several backwater writers shared as a common demoninator
348 for stories that appeared on this board. It was not a hunt-down twits
349 organization. The meetings of net writers were to discuss story-lines, not
350 home phone numbers and addresses of undesirable backwater users. A couple
351 people alligned themselves with 'net' who were not part of the normal
352 group that got together and wrote stories. This un-named (we all know who
353 it is) lady who says she was persecuted by net was in fact bothered by one
354 of the individuals who called themself a member of the net, but was in fact
355 never a 'member', if there was ever such a thing. Repeated messages of
356 explanation to this lady were ignored. Repeated requests, once the situation
357 was known, to the others to cease were also apparently ignored. Once again,
358 a few bad apples spoil the who bunch. Net was devised as an informal
359 writing basis. Some people have a real problem differentiating reality from
360 fiction, and there the problem exists. Net used code to transfer information
361 to other people who knew how to decode. The code was fun to play around with,
362 and was never intended to insult or harm. The code did not contain secret
363 information on people. Many messages were like 'I am planning on going to
364 _____ and try and find Leroy McKane' and other such story plans. Some
365 people want to find the worst in everything, so naturally something as
366 comparatively organized as the net writers were targets. It is too bad that
367 insecurity can cause such untruths to be written. Do not confuse the actions
368 of peripheral characters with the mainline net writers. This is simply not
369 correct. Besides, would you rather have Rajneesh Dangerfield walking the
370 streets of Portland with his green followers causing havoc?

400 I was floating in a dark featureless nothing. I seemed to remember that 
401 there was something else, an old vine covered building that I had aquired 
402 and inhabited so many years before. Or was it... I'm not sure. Do I exist? 
403 Do I have a body? I thought that I did, but now I am not sure. How long have 
404 I been here? Is this all only a dream? Or is this my real state and the rest 
405 has been my dream? Which is real? 
406      .....Eons float by as I ponder my thoughts.....
407 Reality is what you make of it. There is the reality of the physical world, 
408 of rocks and dirt, of green grass and flowering trees, of a blue sky adrift 
409 with fluffy white clouds. Then there is the reality of the mind, the other 
410 images we create inside. Are these any less real? Maybe, and maybe not. But 
411 in the minds eye they are real enough, overlaying the real world of rocks 
412 and trees and sky. We each tint our own glasses through which we see the 
413 world. The physical world doesn't change, it is the same for everyone, but 
414 what we make of it is created in the mind.
415      .....created in the mind.....
416 As I drifted in thought, that phrase kept eching over and over...created in 
417 the mind... and following it but never catching up was a witch on a broom 
418 Which broom? What room? The song birds started to croon. A cat without a 
419 smile was being chased by a smile without a cat. And the musical spheres all 
420 tinkled with joy. The nothingness I floated in felt blue, but sounded far 
421 too tart to have much of an aromma. A pair of red shoes clicked to 
422 themselves about home being noplace. A winged white horse grazed lazily on a 
423 green cloud...  
424      .....Chaos surrounded me, yet through it I began to see a hammering and 
425 pounding, I began to feel the outlines of what sounded like a door. I 
426 reached out towards it, my hands touched a glowing line and the colours 
427 began to quiet down.  The presence of the doorway gave me an anchor, a focal 
428 point around which to organize my thoughts. I reached out and felt along its 
429 length searching for a way through. I found an edge and began to pull, but 
430 it would not budge. I raised my hand and formed it into a fist and began to 
431 pound on the door. A hammer appeared, and I grabed it and used it to try to 
432 force the door. The chaos around me began to become more chaotic if that 
433 were possible. Things were spinning around me faster and faster. This action
434 caused the very substance around me to begin to glow with the heat of the 
435 energy it created. I redoubled my efforts and pounded all the harder.

445 I don't wish to stifly any creative interests here or cause writer unrest,
446 but I get sick of stories that start out with abstract garbage, like:
447 I was floating, yet dandeloins substance drifted through consciousness...
448 Stuff like that is nothing more than pure garbage.  I realize writing is
449 also perhaps a process of mimicry, but please folks, do not mimic any
450 writers on this board, they're all amateurs.  Never has confusing
451 abstract conglomeration of words substituted for a good plot and
452 fine story-telling.

459       Darkness, then light slipping between closed eyelids.  I can't open
460 my eyes.  Is this death?  Life?  Infinity?  EternitY?  Forms and shadows
461 dance is vari-colored twirlings casting lines across a deep, undisturbed
462 sleep.
463       Then coughing, loud coughing.  My lungs ache.  Is it me?  Light grows
464 in intensity.  What is this light?  What is this coughing?  Faint tactile
465 response slams in back and I feel...what?  Noises and sounds send my head
466 reeling backwards.
467       Confusion, inertness and I'm swimming in a sea of red.  Strong salty
468 air laps up the shore and sends black sand flying to slice through the air
469 like a hook.
470       My eyes remain closed.  They will not open...closed?  Dizziness and
471 then, awake.  It is like coming from darkness with light above and breaking
472 the surface in one elegant gesture that beckons.
473       All blurry forms and then back down to darkness...forever.  It is
474 death, life, infinity and eternity in one small twitching package.

521      Listen folks, onr[De of the things that make up my fond memories of the Inn
522 is the acceptance of the creative urges of the other pseudoresidents and the
523 CREATIVE commentary of the stories placed herein.  " Don't copy the styles of
524 the writers on this board, they're all amateurs" hardly sounds constructive 
525 to me.  If that seems to be the way that some of writers currently wish to
526 express themselves, then for Pete's sake (or their own, or anyone's) let them.
527 If you consider it lousy writing, then offer constructive criticism of keep 
528 your mouth shut and hope they get better, which they probably will IF ALLOWED
529 THE ROOM TO GROW.        I'm off my soapbox now.
530 PS:  It's "nice" to know what happened to the NET.  I was wondering...I missed

548 Actually, there is little argument that the "I was floating in a featureless
549 space" line could be a bit better, it it right up there with "It was a dark
550 and stormy night". But on the other hand, I wouldn't consider it "garbage"
551 The basic premiss is hardly new and has been used by many authors.
552 The problem here is an attempt to flex writting muscles and express ideas
553 in front of others in order to refine it into soemthing that works. 
554 The passage I wrote actually was intended to leave the reader confused
555 and questioning. Its purpose was to develope a sense of chaos with the
556 reader, to tune in on that. While the structure was a bit crude, I think that 
557 it achieves that purpose if you are the sort who doesn't mind reading
558 drafts and observing the works of someone trying out new ideas. That is
559 what I enjoy about this system and continue on here, perfection I can get
560 by picking up a book and reading it, but here I can see the very ideas
561 behind those books in the making. I can see budding authors and weekend
562 writters flexing their minds and pens. This is where creativity starts,
563 and that's the best thing about BW as far as I am concerned, to see the
564 occasional glimpse of wheat amongst the chaffe and to know that it is
565 real and new and spontanious, not dragged out of some formula for writting a
566 story or gone over so many times by so many people that the edges are
567 worn off. It is raw, uncut, a diamond in the ruff. That is what makes
568 it exciting and worth it all. OK, so maybe you don't understand it, 
569 but at least it is a heck of a lot cheaper than a lot of other hobbies!

574 Well put, sir Innkeeper.  Now on with the story.
575 
576 I sat back on my chair, holding a large bratwurst on pumperknickel,
577 and looked around.  Something was amiss, but I could not put my
578 finger on it.
579 There she was, the enigma.  A very young, strikingly attractive,
580 woman.  Dressed in rags.  But familiar rags.  The old fortune
581 teller's rags.  
582 I touched the Philosopher's arm.  "I think something is going on here,
583 my friend.  Look at that young lady, the one by the fire.  Do those
584 clothes look familiar?"
585 My friend looked across the room, and a look of puzzlement and fear
586 crossed his noble features.

593      "Stop making that horrible noise!" Cragmore growled. The grating noise
594 continued. "I said..." he stopped when he realized what the sound really
595 was. A moth fluttered around the Inn's fire, the sound from it's wings
596 magnified several magnitudes by Cragmore's hungover senses. "Ohhhh."
597      Standing up, and witnessing a spectacular light show on the back of
598 his eye-lids, the local psi-specialist shook the drink-induced slumber from
599 his body. "Ahhhh."
600      "I've got to come up with a better way to shield my mind from all these
601 people's thoughts" he said to himself. "Rum and ale simply have too many side
602 effects."
603      It was late afternoon, he could tell by the shadows cast from the light
604 through the high window above the Inn's front door. Several regulars sat
605 about in usual repose, talking, drinking, pondering. "Pondering!" Cragmore
606 thought to himself. "The ponderable door!" He looked, and sure enough, the
607 door still stood. "Of course it's still there. I've only been slumped at
608 my table for.... Oh damn. But the door."
609      With great deliberate motions, Cragmore moved away from his table
610 and towards the door. He tried to shut out the immense pounding in his
611 head, the the roar of his feet moving across the floor. "Uhhh."
612      The curtain put up by the Innkeeper had been moved away. Cragmore
613 recalled that some stranger had thrown aside the cover when someone else
614 seen the door suddenly begin to glow. The door was covered with a thin,
615 sticky covering, which Cragmore jabbed with the ring finger of his right
616 hand. The cover gave but did not break. Removing his finger, the cover
617 returned to its original shape. In a moment, all trace of the poke was
618 gone.
619      "Does anyone know what this blasted stuff all over the door is?" he
620 asked aloud. In his mind, he heard a dozen 'huhs?', but no one spoke aloud.
621 "Well, has everyone suddenly lost their tongue?"
622      "We are tired of the door." someone towards the back of the Inn said.
623      "Yeah, who cares about the door. It's been covered like that for three
624 days. We tried to remove the stuff, but it just uncrumples itself. We even
625 tried dousing it with 'Zilla ale, but it didn't do any good, and made a
626 stain on the floor." the replacement innkeeper said. Sure enough, Cragmore
627 saw the spot on the floor where some of the wood had been eaten away by the
628 ale. "I drink that stuff!" he gulped to himself.
