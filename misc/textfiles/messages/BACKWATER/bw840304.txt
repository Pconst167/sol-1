20   Oh wow, I guess the system CRASHED. I will try to boggle you for now.
21   First, my name is Frizbee. I live in beaverton. I am what you would
22 call the new kid on the block. I would like to introduc myself to you all.
23   I just got this number and a few others like it. (although i've had a
24 modem for some time, I only had a few cheap #'s to call)
25   I was just on the computer before it CRASHED (I don't know if it crashed,
26 I just can't find any listings)
27  I'd just like to say HI to 'GRAY' and a special HI to the richest man
28 in the world, one most of you know..............BO
29   Well, it's way past my bedtime (12:22:31 AM) so I'd best be off. (I'not 
30 actually from beaverton, nor the EARTH, I'm from the planet GLEEB)
31     I'll tell you guys about nmy adventures later, and I've got lots to 
32 tell. 
33 so I leave you with the most infamous English saying today............
34                          WHERE'S THE BEEF!!!
35 goodbye.................................................Frizbee
36 Dear Friz:
37 The system didn't crash, the Sysop just changed the newspaper on the 
38 bottom of our cage. To see the old paper, just type "DB". To get back 
39 here, type "DA". And don't forget to wear your lead undies, the Russians
40 are beaming us, you know. They've got all the beef, too.

43 Looking around the back room, the piper tried to
44 take count.  "Is this everyone who is going to seek the Wizard?"
45   As she entered, he turned to Lynn, "Lassie, I dinna ken...  Oops!" he
46 put his hand over his mouth, then waited a moment and asked respectfully,
47 "M'am, as you are the leader of this expidition, could we confer as to
48 our route, destination, and some alternate plans in case of disaster? 
49 IYou should also know of the limitations of the pipes, as they will be
50 our main transport through the various realities."
51   He held a chair for her as she sat at the table, and at her nod seated
52 himself and began.
53   "I am not entirely certain in what manner the pipes enable me and those
54 around me to change their perception of reality.  I simply know that the
55 sustained sound of these pipes causes the cooperative perception of reality
56 to become less secure.  By careful concentration, I can easily change my
57 personal perception of reality and move into the mundane world.  With 
58 intense unopposed effort, I can make changes in the reality of the Inn.
59 I have not experimented with the active aid and co-operation of others.  I
60 feel certain that we must agree upon our destination prior to embarking
61 upon a trans-reality expedition, and as the transportation of the expedition
62 ask that you regard me much as a hired capitan on a sailing vessel.  I
63 must be free to act without consultation in case of emergency -- a situation
64 I shudder to contemplate.  If this situation is acceptable to you and the
65 others, I await your orders as master of this expedition."
66 The piper bowed briefly to Lynn, then turned to the others.
67 "If, indeed, this is to be the arraingement -- it must be with the full
68 cooperation of everyone.  If this is not satisfactory, for heaven's sake
69 speak now.  My instincts tell me that we must move and act as one.  I cannot
70 promise perfect judgement in transporting us, only the best that I can do
71 as well as my word that I will endeavor to keep us all together no matter
72 which realities we traverse.  I do not seek, nor wish any leadership role
73 when we have established ourselves in a given reality.  In fact, if we use
74 the ship as a metaphor, we really should try a short cruise to see if 
75 we can work together, before we set sail for uncharted lands."

79   It was later than normal for closing
80 down the lot, but for some reason,
81 more people than normal were taking an
82 interest in bolos today. I was tired,
83 and deeply in need of some rest when
84 both lines on my phone began to ring.
85 
86    "hello,  who, no, there's no one by
87 the name of Salazar here. you must
88 have the wrong reality."
89 
90    I checked the other line, "hello,
91 what? those crazy backwater folk are
92 out to destroy our lot again?  I
93 wonder what brought it on this time. 
94 Of course I'm not worried. We both 
95 that we are the only two people who
96 know of the only wepon bolo's are not
97 prepared to face, and who would be
98 crazy enough to go after a tank with a
99 stickshift.  WHAT!!!!!"
100   
101    Now I really began to sweat. There
102 was only one man who would try such a
103 thing, but I had thought he was dead.
104 So the rumors were true, the Ninja did
105 find Phillipe and get the 'get out of
106 heaven free' card.
107 
108    "Don't worry, I certainly won't," I
109 lied, "we still have our secret wepon,
110 even the ninja won't be prepared for
111 this."
112   
113     I hung up. And hoped I was right.

132 Looking about him, the bard decided that there were only two songs WEIRD
133 enough for this group. And singing would keep their minds of off the transfer...

169 Good! They weren't paying attention to more than the next few feet of trail.
170 It would be much simpler to make the shift. 
171 "Where exactly IS this lot? Give me some sort of description to "home-in" on,
172 please."

174 The apprentice spoke up, "Uh, milord..."
175 "I wouldn't try any tests from this room, if I were you. You see, 
176 I didn't want any more 'unfortunate incidents', so I... well...
177 I used a spell something like the one on thy sporran (I assume that IS a
178 spell?). In any case, milords, while the door is closed you might say that there
179 isn't any 'outside'. I really have no wish to find out what would happen......."
180 "However, on the positive side, the back door over there doesn't
181 open on the back side of the inn. It opens on a clearing in the woods about
182 three miles away."
183 Seeing the look the piper was giving him, he continued, "No, I
184 can't shift us around the way you can, I'd been working on this 'shortcut' for
185 some time now. It seemed like a good time to use it."
186 "Sorry, if I messed things up, but at least we won't be disturbed in here!"

191        As I looked into the screen I noticed the letters swimming around in
192 a manner not unlike rippling water. Hmmm, I thought to meselfs, it appears
193 that once again I'm assaulted from the nether regions of Throbar ( for those
194 not in the know, Throbar is roughly 50 parsecs or so due north of Drinmar
195 as the grimnal warps) and without my trusty electroparticulizer it could
196 get mighty nasty. You see, the Lord Srrapnel and I once got into it over this
197 little beauty from Gavenol 7 and ever since that day have been the most bitter
198 of enemies. His favorite trick was to catch me unawares and make me do the
199 most dastardly things in public and/or to the public. Now we battle it out
200 and leave the clean up for the galactic police. Whole planets have been used
201 to settle this issue and it never ceases. Help me! Oh you people off the 
202 Inn for in this all our lives are twined. I, Lasater Jeserath, warn you!!
203 88888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888
204 !~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~
205      My breath came in quick gasps.  My lungs were aching.  My feet pounded
206 along the packed earth trail... branches lightly brushing my legs.  My name
207 is Salazar; but right about now, I was thinking of changing it to 'Dummy'.
208      My trip to the Hutton estate gained me little.  The grieving wife,
209 Katherine, said all the right things, but underneath I could see she wasn't
210 too concerned with her husband's disappearance.  The safe that held the
211 Phoenix's Egg was a good one.  No sign of forced entry.  Somebody knew the
212 combination.  But who?
213      The only other lead was a map of Cornelius Hutton's route of his last
214 run through the Park.  10 K's--6.2 miles.  I had to run it.  Forget that I
215 tip the scale at 200 lbs.  Forget that I puff away two packs of smokes a day
216 It was my only lead... and a slim one.  Somewhere up and down those hills
217 there might be a clue I could latch onto.
218      My side was starting to ache where my .44 was slapping back and forth.
219 Shoulder holsters aren't made for long distance running.  Aha! A down hill
220 stretch.  As I rounded the corner my path was blocked by three bald-headed
221 men in saffron robes.  The ugly one spoke up first:
222      "Mr. Salazar, you are beginning to irritate us--first you will tell
223 us everything you know--then you will die."
224      This hadn't been my day.  I was starting to get mad.  When the long,
225 curved knives appeared in their hands, I became absolutely livid.  My 
226 magnaported .44 slithered into my hand.  She's my best friend.  I never go
227 anywhere without her.  She doesn't say much... but when she does, people
228 listen.  The hairy fishnuts started to move closer.
229 
230            Whomp!         Whomp!
231         <God, I love it when she talks dirty>
232      Two of the fishnuts when flying...  The third(the ugly one) was too 
233 fast for me.  A spinning back kick.  The .44 took a side trip into the
234 bushes.  I leapt back.  Another kung fu freak.  I know a little of the 
235 martial arts myself:
236      "Hey baldy, your shoe's untied."
237      He looked down.  A kick to the groin.  A left cross to the temple.  One
238 hairy fushnut in the Land of Nod.  I was starting to feel better.  I went
239 looking for my gun.  Ah, there she was in those funny looking bushes.  As I
240 picked her up,  I remembered what type of bushes those were...
241 Poison Oak.
242      I took out my frustrations on the remaining fishnut.  He couldn't tell
243 me much.  They were looking for the egg, too, to finance their operations.
244 But he did give me one juicy bit of info.  Katherine Hutton donated freely
245 to their operation.  Hmmm... Interesting.  Not knowing what else to do with
246 baldy, I broke his neck.
247      When I dragged myself back to my office, Serena was waiting.  She had\
248 that 'I'm ready for anything' smile on her lips.  The donkey was ready too.
249 My poison oak started to itch.  This just wasn't my day.  I run through
250 the woods in my underwear, get attacked by three jerks in tacky bathrobes,
251 and my girl's ready and I look like a broiled lobster from the waist down.
252 The time had come, I went into the back office and had a good cry.

323 ..."Well", the mathematician muttered under his breath. He noticed
324    that the 'hairy-footed metaphysicists' were sort of running out of
325    talk concerning religious preferences and their justification, and
326    someone over toward the middle of the room was yelling More Dialog.
327    The mathematician knew that he tended toward a technical bent, but
328    that it was the social implications of technology that he found
329    most fascinating. One thing that certainly needs consideration
330    these days is artificial intelligence programs and more important
331    the fallout programs that are being used to analyze and predict
332    patterns and actions of people. (Ignoring for a moment the debate
333    concerning the nature of intelligence both real and artificial.)
334    Those of you who get the Sharper Image Catalog have no doubt seen
335    the software program called "Sell Dirty". It's a program that
336    develops a profile of a customer from data input and tells the
337    salesman what nature of sales pitch to lay on. Such ideas are not
338    new, here's a message that appeared on several bulletin boards
339    a couple of years ago. It was also floating around on Tele-mail
340    for awhile.
341 
342      Since the 1940's when C.E. Shannon published his classic
343      paper on Information Theory, the powerful concepts it made
344      available have been used for all sorts of communication
345      analysis. One recent development is a correlation technique
346      to analyze the content & style of either spoken or written
347      communication, and develop a personality profile, behavior
348      pattern and belief structure of the author. One study used
349      a computer public message system where everyone used any
350      fictitious name they wished. After a few months of use the
351      computer developed profile was compared to a survey of the
352      participants and their friends. Not only was the accuracy
353      of the prediction amazingly high, but the computer matched
354      the assumed names to the real people 94% of the time.
355      The computer also predicted which people would respond to
356      messages based on the message contents.
357      *FOOD FOR THOUGHT AS ONE LEAVES A MESSAGE ON A PUBLIC BBS*
358 
359 ...Now that is food for thought the mathematician mumbled to himself.
360    He had noticed recently a comment concerning A.I. in one of those
361    boring technical journals one feels obliged to read. A person
362    much involved in the A.I. field had said, "1984 will probably not be
363    the year that machines learn to think, but it will probably be
364    the year that a lot of people think they do."  
365    As he was thinking about this he remembered that those @%#*$%%*(&
366    (nice folks) at the I.R.S. have been trying to purchase some data
367    and programs to predict which folks are likely to be cheating on
368    their taxes. Where is it all going to lead he contemplated.
369    They haven't made machines think but they have certainly shown
370    that most people are creatures of habit and can be predicted to
371    act in certain ways under specified circumstances. Well he'd
372    fool em' today by calling the backwater at a different time
373    and going out for a vanilla icecream cone instead. "Gad!",
374    maybe that person was right who said the danger is not that
375    machines might be programmed to think like people but that
376    people would start to think like machines.

383     I see myself sitting in an office, just about to close the
384 biggest bolo deal of the century, when I was awakened by the phone
385 once again.
386 
387     "...what...is there anyone there?"  Then I turned the phone around. Much better.
388 "What is it at this time of the night?"  I knew that if someone was
389 to call now it must be important. "No, you expect me to believe
390 that this thing all started with that Jeserath character.  God knows
391 I haven't seen him since he welched on those gambling debts he owes."  
392 My bank book gave a little whine at that comment.  "What you mean
393 the backwater crazies have already made it to the lot? Questioning a
394 Mark XI?  No, I doubt if they get much out of it.  It dosen't even
395 know what the secret wepon looks like.  And who would ever expect the 
396 used VW bug across the street is really my secret Mark XIII?  
397     No, I'd better get out there. thanks for the warning.  I think Laseter 
398 is taking us all for a ride."

416 Dear Leroy:
417      I've heard that you might be reached through the Backwater.  If you're
418 interested in a used BOLO, you might try Fast Fred's.  Also would like to
419 know if you have heard anything on the disappearance of the Phoenix's Egg.
420 Salazar and Serena are searching for it.  I know you and Salazar are at odds,
421 but there might be a profit in it.  Will be entering the U.S. via a tramp
422 steamer soon.  Let me know if you have any capers going.
423                                         Regards,
424                                         Mohammed Wassir
425                                    <The greedy Albanian>
426 P.S.  Have you heard anything on the supposed return of the Grand Dragonmaster?
427 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

438 The Poet, though astonishingly good at entrances & exits, was abominably 
439 bad at bumping into things in between. It was thus that he, having stepped
440 quietly out what appeared to be the back door ahead of the rest of the party,
441 was completely astonished to find himself in pitch-black woods, with the Inn
442 nowhere in sight. 
443 "What the..." he exclaimed brilliantly, walking headlon into a low-hanging
444 branch. For the second time tonight he saw the black and yellow stars. He 
445 woke barely in time to hear the others' voices fading in the distance.
446 The next hour was a painful one, as he accquainted himself intimately with 
447 half the trees in the forest. The only thing more amazing than the amount 
448 of noise he made was the fact that his friends never detected his presence.
449 Finally reaching the Bolo lot, the party stopped to survey the locals,
450 giving the player the chance to step into the shadows and wait for the best
451 moment for his entrance. 
452 He was astonishingly good at entrances.

455 Dear Pam:
456      Speak up! I know you're out there.

460 Fast Freddie:  I also like your style.  I'm particulartly pleased
461 to see someone take the "other" side.  I just hope, now that you have
462 'picked up the ball', that you can run with it without tripping.
463 I must admit to being curious whether you are someone new, or another
464 alias of one of the regulars. (I believe there are only 5 peoplebehind
465 all these names.)
466 BARD:  I liked your space opera song.  It does a good job of capturing
467 the E.E. Smith/Jack Williamson/John Campbell spirit.

470 Stepping out the back door with Lynn and the apprentice, the piper smiled.
471 "Perhaps it's a good thing to put a little distance between us and the others
472 before making any test runs.  I'm not sure just how fine control we can get
473 over just how we affect realitiy.  Perhaps those who communicate with us
474 or even remain aware of our existance will be affected in some way by what
475 we do."
476   Stepping into a small clearing, he said, "Perhaps we should wait here for 
477 a few moments for whoever else wants to go with our party.  I see that the
478 group going for the BOLO lot seems to be getting into the swing of things
479 quite nicely."
480   He lifted his pipes and before blowing, remarked "Perhaps we should have a
481 beacon of some sort.  I'll try a fairly stable song -- Bonnie Dundee."
482   Settling the drones on his shoulder, he inflated the bag and gave it a sharp
483 tap to start the drones.  They sounded like a strange giant  clearing his 
484 throat, then caught sounding as though a thousand Thibetan monks were chanting
485 "AUHMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.........
486 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

489 Dear Mohammed:
490 
491 Salazar is a scumbag; I'll have nothing to do with that 
492 two-bit cretin. He and that pantywaist Ninja aren't in the 
493 same league as real men like us.
494 
495 Profit you say?  How much?  Where from?  What risk?  Do I have 
496 to associate with tinkerbell and his friend?
497 
498 I've been following the action. Don't know that I buy it. 
499 You know what a stickler I am to keeping to the facts. The 
500 real world is where I'm at. Don't have much stomach for all 
501 this fantasy crap.
502 
503 For example, what kind of fool would try to take out a Bolo 
504 with a stickshift. You couldn't even dent one of those 
505 suckers, not even if it were one of the less sophisticated 
508 early models. If you doubt what I say, ask Fast Fredie. He 
509 knows.
510 
511 Besides, I don't know if even I've got the guts to get 
512 involved in a Katherine Hutton scam. Then again it would 
513 depend alot on the money.

517 The bard smiled as he ran thru a check on the controller. The trapdoor codes in
518 the original command code block had apparently been left in in the later models,
519 good! He didn't know if he could control any of the bolos but at least they'd 
520 KNOW he was on their side.
521 "Ninja..."
522 "Yes?"
523 "You might try checking out that car over there, I'm getting a telemetry
524 signal from it..... and the only things around here that I should be getting 
525 anything from are BOLOs so...."
526 
527 "Unit LNE, status report!" the bard spoke in a commanding voice into
528 the box he had called a 'controller'. A voice came from the BOLO:
529 "AUTHENTICATION CODE NOT RECIEVED!"
530 "Damn!", muttered the bard as he pressed on some peg-like objects on the box.
531 "CODE RECIEVED.... AND VERIFIED. STATUS NOMINAL."
532 "INSTRUCTIONS, SIR?"
533 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
534 Freddie:let me make one thing clear, I am NOT cheating. If you didn't see this
535 coming as soon as I pulled out the 'controller'........
536 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
537 The apprentice closed the 'door'. From this side it looked like some random
538 cracks in the trunk of a LARGE Douglas Fir. There was a branch stub at about the
539 right height for a knob. As he closed it, he 'set' it to open to any of the 
540 party, anyone else would waste their time attempting to pull the branch off of 
541 the tree trunk.
542 He cleared his mind and stood, relaxed and waiting, while the piper played.

545 Voyeur,5 ?? I count  7 at thg very least.
546 Fini Fin,a BOLO is a VERY large tank,after about model VII they became
547 sentiant creatures.rumor has it that a "backdoor" was put in all models up to XI
548 that enabled its origional creator to disable it with a properly placed late
549 60's stick shift.
