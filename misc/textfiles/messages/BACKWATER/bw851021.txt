23   But as the creature emerged from the cave, the supposed stench of death
24 still on his mind, he beheld a sight he could not believe. Hartleeb stood
25 before him, untouched, unscathed, breathing, alive, and holding the most
26 wicked electronic device he had ever seen.
27   "You speak of knowing your enemies. You speak of revenge and death. You
28 will soon know much more about death you over-inflated bit of epsilon
29 material!" Hartleeb's words rang clear in Bear's frightened mind.
30   "But...but how?" It was all Bear could do to stammer in disbelief. His
31 mind was too slow to comprehend what raged in front of him.
32   "You have your silly projectors. Simple writers tools not worthy of a single
33 iota of disk space. You change the story to suit your own twisted ways. You
34 kill for the sake of killing. You strike out at those around you in futile
35 attempts at raising yourself above them. You disgust me! But yes you
36 do exist, and therefore I must deal with you."
37   "But...but what are you going to do?"
38   "Not so brave now, oh flesh and blood creature. Now projection becomes so
39 frightened he can not control his bladder. No image shakes in his boots
40 because he is about to meet his maker. You are too pitiful for anything
41 but the true Bear. Wild Kingdom notwithstanding. I have had enough of this
42 rather one-sided conversation. I grow bored with your groveling."
43   "But please don't hurt me. I didn't know what I was doing. Please sir, give
44 me another chance......"
45   But before Bear could continue his begging, the place where Hartleeb stood
46 was replaced by a bright light, and then nothing. The only sounds above the
47 breeze waving the grass was Bear's continued sniffles. Softly at first, and
48 then with more force, laughter shook the air. Bear looked around, but could
49 not determine the source.
50   "Do not worry Bear, you are not crazy. I will not DESTROYER you, a worthless
51 effort is an effort wasted. Travel onward and show your teeth to the fools
52 you may meet along the way. I severe any connection with you. Any mention of
53 me must be figments of your tiny imagination. I will no longer waste my
54 time in your space, do not attempt to continue the waste. Good hunting
55 cousin, and bare your true self often."
56   The voice faded in Bear's head. He turned a continued his journey, not
57 too much the worse for wear except for a pair of wet britches and a rather
58 damaged ego.
59                                                Hartleeb

71    'Crystal Palace' was more than just a name. Just the sight of it took James' breath away. Even from a thousand
72 yards away, where the ship had set down. Behind him, Tariya said, "You're sure you left that cannon behind."
73    "Yes." he said, a little irritatedly, still staring.
74    "No technological devices are allowed within the Palace. They would upset the balance of the spell and that's
75 something we don't want to happen." She didn't feel as matter of fact as she sounded. Almost unconciously they stayed
76 close together as they approached the intimidating structure.
77    It was easily the size of the Houston Astrodome, but looked a little like the Emerald City in the movie 'Wizard of
78 Oz' but instead of emerald it was made of crystal. Perfect, tranparent crystal. It was possible to see entirely
79 through the building, as well as all the rooms inside. The star Rigel shone clearly through the central tower, which
80 must have been three thousand feet high. "We're not going to climb that sucker, are we?" He asked.
81    Tariya was silent, but from awe or reverence or whatever he couldn't tell. He wished he could read people better.
82 It was just as well he couldn't, or he would have been a hell of a lot more nervous.
83    They climbed see-through stairs and passed through a huge crystal arch. James examined the arch more closely. He
84 tapped his class ring against a pillar. A hollow note, low and pure, came back. Sympathetic vibrations spread until
85 the whole building was humming. Tariya looked at him and he grinned sheepishly. "Sorry." He felt like a child who had
86 gotten out of hand at a departmet store and was about to be scolded by his mother.
87    She (Tariya, not his mother) said nothing, though. She just turned back and continued on, almost seeming to be in a
88 trance. James had to run to catch up to her. She was right about the power. He could feel its heat from everything in
89 here. He wasn't trained at sensing energies, and wondered what she felt. All he knew for sure was that he was
90 definitely out of his depth here.
91    Finally they came to a large chamber directly beneath the tower. James looked up and saw that there was no physical
92 way into the tower. Then he thought about all those tons of crystal that was situated directly over their heads and
93 decided to think of something else.
94    When she got to the center of the chamber, Tariya shook her head, clearing it. She looked and saw that James had
95 followed her all the way in. She'd forgotten all about him. The power of this place had a way of overwhelming the
96 unwary mind. Or so she'd heard. She would have to be careful. James seemed unaffected.
97    James came up behind her. "Now what?"
98    "Now you be quiet. I'm going to try a locater spell that will encompass the known universe and I can't have any
99 distractions. The forces here are not to be lightly disturbed."
100    "I'll bet not. Should I go stand outside?"
101    "No." she said, just a little too quickly. She tried to conceal her nervousness. "I... want you here, with
102 me."
103    "Okay." he said, seemingly unworried. She envied him his ignorance.
104    She settled into a crosslegged position (not easy in that robe) on the cold floor. Clearing her mind of all
105 unneccesary thoughts, she tried to remember the spell. A few of the details were a bit fuzzy, but if they wouldn't
106 come, she could improvise. She was (almost) totally confident in her ability to do so.
107    Unfortunately, in magic, not being exact was somewhat akin to playing Russian roulette. And in this case, all the
108 chambers were loaded.

114 StormBringer:  What is your site and login?
115 All: how many Inn tennants haunt the usenet?
116 Mikey: What about someone cleaning up and posting the disks to the usenet, I
117 would volonteer as a gateway for that.
118 All (again): anyone have the disk that was DB previous to the one that is DB
119 now?  If so, please mail it to address below or contact me here for a transfer
120 at any speed up to 2400 bps.
121 Blue: Thanks for the reminder, will probably miss today, but will be there
122 tomorrow.  Where will you be?  Glad you are keeping a low profile, gives me
123 a chance to work my feelings out, hopefully things will get better.  Time
124 does heel most wounds and other things.
125 It's this big expance of water stretching as far as I can see in any direction,
126 interupted only by an ocasional white cap in the moments when the wind gets
127 stronger.  Its been this way for days and days.  I look where I should be, and
128 there is nothing, my mind has lost all phisical connections and it feels good,
129 the sort of feeling that can only come from total lack of sensory feed-back. It
130 is peacefull.  I can peel off layerers upon layers of myself and as I aproach
131 my core, I find there is something new there.  Something that has been so litle
132 used it has become fresh and alive.  It is something I need to give tender care
133 and loving to, too far in for me to be able to aford killing it too.
134 I'm a walking down the line<cr>I'm a walking down the line<cr
135 Walking down the line, my feel 'll be a flyin', tell you 'bout my troubled mind.

139           next.  Brothers should be there too.  Hope to see you.  Low profiles
140           are best at this time.  Hopefully all will pass and things will be
141           able to start again.  Tempers flair and things said at times regreted

144 ...After the Bear had traversed into the
145 cave for some time, an echo rang through
146 the darkened passage. It was faint, and distant, and sounded like it was coming
147 from the entrance. Curious, the Bear retraced his steps back toward the entrance.
148 (Author's note: perhaps we should mention that at the end of the 2nd install-
149 ment, after Hartleeb's brutal demise, that the Bear had continued INTO the
150 tunnel. The latest discourse written above somehow seems to have lost all track
151 of the story line and began with the Bear EMERGING from the cave. The relevancy
152 of this will soon come clear).
153 
154 He walked slowly, sword withdrawn. He stepped gingerly over Hartleeb's limp
155 body, still sprawled on the floor of the cave. As he walked over it, the body
156 twitched just the slightest bit, a rattle of stale air emitting from its lips.
157 The Bear walked on, noting the two green creatures also laying dead on the
158 ground.
159 
160 As he neared the entrance to the cave, he heard a raspy voice rattling in the
161 wind, as if the trees of the forest were brushing together in a sickening 
162 harmony of a death song.
163 
164 "... Not so brave now, oh flesh and blood creature..." the voice seemed to say.
165 The Bear supressed a small gasp as he looked up into the sky. A wispy form,
166 looking not unlike the Hartleeb corpse he had just seen, was wavering in the
167 sky. The shadowy mouth was moving in time with the words.
168 
169 "... I grow bored of your grovelling..." The mouth continued moving as the words
170 "But please don't hurt me, I didn't know what I was doing!" came floating down.
171 The Bear looked around himself, slightly confused. "Hmm, that sounds like another
172 conversation, but the mouth is still moving! He must be... talking to himself!"
173 The Bear shook his head, remembering a nearly forgotten curse he had heard many
174 many years ago. The curse was spoken by the creaters of the atomizing laser
175 cannon, which was now quite outdated, but was still in use by primitive bounty
176 unters who still lurked about now and then.
177 
178 In fact, it was the same gun which had been meant for his death, but fired at
179 a simple yet effective image device instead. And the curse went something like
180 this:
181 
182 "... Ye who use this weapon, must take care to treat it wisely.
183 For the mistreatment of this finely crafted gun shall not go unpunished.
184 He who uses the gun for evil intent, and thereby is killed in just reprisal,
185 Shall roam forever in the spirit world... thinking he is God, and condemning
186 forever those who served him justice.
187 
188 Your inflated pride shall cause you to believe all others are against you,
189 And are not worthy of your time or trouble.
190 And yet you will haunt them, and despise them despite your supposed disdain,
191 And in your belief of being Goshall create images of your enemies, which
192 you shall haunt... but in reality they shall haunt you.
193 
194 Because they are not the true beings you seek, but nightmares which you will
195 never be able to release for all eternity..."
196 
197 The Bear shivered when he remembered those words, and looked with sadness at
198 the figure floating above, talking to himself.
199 
200 "Hartleeb was never a worthy foe, but that fate I would not wish upon even my
201 worst enemy. And that enemy is still to face me... but Hartleeb roams in that
202 terrible egoland forever," the Bear spoke aloud, knowing no one could hear,
203 but the pain which filled his heart needed that small release.
204 
205 He turned once again, sheathing his strong sword in his jewel encrusted sheath,
206 and journeyed back in the tunnel...

222      The radio was silent. Low hiss replaced the sounds of human voices that
223 had issued from the speaker only moments before.
224      "What happened? Are they still there?" Bard asked.
225      "I don't believe this!" Emu said still staring into the scanner. "The
226 thing that was in our hold is now gone. It just vanished off my screen. One
227 second it was there, occupying space and taking mass, but now the methane
228 hold is as empty as when we took off. But that's not all." Switching his
229 gaze from the internal scanner to the exterior unit, Emu continued his
230 series of startling revelations. "The convolution that swirled around us
231 has dissipated. We are in..... we are in....."
232      "Yes Emu?" Four voices spoke as one.
233      "I recognize these numbers! This is were we left off, just before
234 piper disappeared into the ZEB creature!"
235      "Let me see that." Trainor moved quickly to the screen. His eyes
236 widened in disbelief as he too recognized the coordinates. "Emu is
237 right. We are certainly back in known space. No convolutions. No spatial
238 rips. Just plain ordinary multi-reality space!"
239      "Something else is not right." The others turned as Cragmore once again
240 spoiled the party with bad news. "The entity we once called ZEB is also gone.
241 It is evaporating as its life force dwindles. Nothing much remains of it now
242 but an empty shell."
243      "You mean we have done it?" Bard said excitedly.
244      "We have destroyed the hive, but the deadly queen escapes, my friend."
245      "Deadly queen? You don't mean the woman we brought on board with
246 Piper do you?"
247      Cragmore didn't have to answer, the other's now knew Cragmore's secret.
248 Nearly pushing him over, Trainor started on his way back to the chamber, with
249 Emu and Bard following behind, this time with far more determination.
250 Cragmore tried to stop them, but he knew it was useless. He followed at a
251 slower pace, knowing the field surrounding the room would stop them, at
252 least momentarily.
253 
254       Piper rested outside the chamber door. While the soreness in his arm
255 reminded him of the near-tragedy he had taken part in before, a renewed
256 sense of being surrounded him. Piper felt not the power of fear the others
257 seemed to have felt from the shield around the door, but more an energy of
258 rebirth, as if the process of age and death around him had suddenly
259 reversed. He could not pin down the feeling, but nevertheless it was there.
260       His time of reflection was disturbed by the hurried sound of footsteps.
261 He looked up to see Trainor, Emu, and Bard charging his way. He was about to
262 speak to his companions when he noticed the look in Trainor's eyes. They
263 were wild with hate, a sense of loathing covered his whole face.
264       It didn't take long for Piper to realize why Trainor was in such a
265 state.
266       "Please move aside Piper." Trainor said as calmly as he could. "I
267 would like to get in to the room."
268       "Ah, shouldn't we wait for Cragmore?" offered Emu, now for the 
269 first time noticing Trainor's mood.
270       "No, we don't need him. I have got to get into that room!" And with
271 a scream Trainor lunged at the door.

276 As a casual observer of the Hartleeb-Bear battle, it seems to me that the Bear
277 is winning this war of words... especially now that Hartleeb apears to have

316   The wound in the piper's arm was throbbing in time with the beat of his 
317 heart.  THROB twinge....THROB twinge...THROB twinge-- the steady rhythm 
318 seemed to fill the air around him.  Somehow, by imperceptible degrees, the
319 sound changed to that of footsteps coming down the long, highly-decorated
320 corridor.  The oncoming footsteps, ringing on the ornately inlayed floor,
321 seemed to carry with them a sense of urgency.  With a sigh, he began the 
322 long struggle to stand erect as three hurrying figures came into view.
323   The piper felt a strange sense of bemusement at the confrontation, a
324 feeling of "not quite there," that he laid on the effects of loss of blood
325 and sleep, as though the words and actions that he went through were somehow
326 in response to a large script that called for the players to follow a set of
327 infinitely detailed stage directions.  Somehow the words were said, but the
328 meaning escaped him.  People moved, more words, then the piper felt himself
329 thrust aside by a careless shoulder.  The flash of pain as his wound tore 
330 open ripped the fog of incomprehension from his mind.  He grasped at the wound
331 to staunch the gush of warm blood as he saw Trainor approach the door.  The
332 twisting of his face betrayed his internal torment as he lunged for the
333 warded door.

352 As the Bear strode into the cavern, he took one last look out into the light
353 beyond. The apparatition was disappearing now, the only thing left was the 
354 fading light of that strange planet's two setting suns. Night was coming, and
355 Bear realized that he'd better catch some sleep before venturing back into the
356 cave... and the adventures which lay in waiting beyond.
357 
358 He also realized that the foul stench of the three bodies further back in the
359 tunnel might attrack some of the less appealing creatures of this world, and of
360 course leave a trail which might be followed. With a shiver, he realized that
361 two objectives could be accomplished with one act.
362 
363 He sat with his back against the craggy rock near the entrance of the cave. The
364 fire before him flickered high into the night, casting eerie shadows upon the
365 trees of the forest beyond.
366 
367 As he chewed on his Lipare' - a nutritious Quarian food perfect for long
368 journies- he gazed upon the fire. This was one fire he dared not cook any food 
369 
370 in... for in it sizzled the three bodies of his recent enemies. He mused that 
371 the warmth they were giving him now, was as warmhearted as they'd ever been in
372 all their lives.
373 
374 As he drifted off to sleep, one corner of his eye detected some movement, just
375 out of the dancing shadows of the fire. His body moved nary an inch... there it
376 
377 was again! Pulling himself to complete consciousness, and gripped his sword
378 tighter, and gazed through near-closed eyes at the increasing number of shadowy
379 movements beyond...

383 THE BEAR and Hartleeb, you should be ashamed of yourselves wasting BW disk space
384 with your egotistical thrashings of pseudo-machoism one upmenship. Take your
385 personal battles elsewhere. Face it, neither of you will admit defeat. You
386 simply twist the other's words, be proud of your infantile accomplishment, and
387 wait until the other does the same. Cycle onward like an endless screw. Visit
388 some unsuspecting AE board with your trite maneuvers for superiority. We don't
389 need it. We don't want it.

405 Wait a minute! Someone's using my name! This is the REAL Bear, and just as I
406 started feeling bad about my Hartleeb war, here comes some faker egging everyone
407 on again... oh, well, so it goes with a public board.
408 
409 Anyway, for the real record... at first I was just poking a little fun. When
410 my character got blown away by H., I had two choices: stay dead or fight back.
411 As any proper adventurer would, I fought back. The words grew unexpectedly
412 nasty... and I regret that. For all I
413 know H. is a very nice guy (I have my honest doubts tho), and I'd simply like
414 to continue on with my story (as long as others are enjoying it). It was pretty
415 fun while it lasted... but I'm ready to make amends and go on....

435    The Brats Acroos The Street...
436 
437    I was walking up the street one day after school... What do I have to listen to? Anna, head brat, telling everybody 
438 that they had to play house, like it or not. (these are kids of about 7). And boy she said it loud. About half an hour 
439 later I was forced to hear Megan crying about something and theen hearing another brat saying, "Ha ha ha ha, ha." Then 
440 as I walk down to get a big gulp, I notice that all the kids are on one poor
441 mothers porch who only has on of the 9 kids who frequently stay there. I feel sorry for that peticular mother because 
442 all the other parents duump their kids at that house so they can get some peice and quiet. It goes on like this all day 
443 until the kids have to go to bed and I hear them crying about that. Usually thats what I wake up to also.
444    I tell you people who hate your younger brothers and sisters...

452 This time the trip was much more pleasant than the last.  I had read somewhere
453 that the human body objects to travelling over .4 lightspeed, and that the
454 internal jumping-jacks that your stomach does after using a Door is the
455 evidence supporting it.  I don't really know, but I still shudder for a second
456 at the thought of making just one more jump through what the common man called
457 'hyperspace', 'nil-space', 'the void', 'elsewhere', and 'unspace'.  Almost
458 always is thetrip slightly unpleasant.  This time, my stomach stayed in its
459 rightful place, unpreturbed by my Passkey's unabashed twisting of the laws
460 of the universe into so many pretzels.  Apt analogy, I thought to myself.
461 I had jumped to the coordinates of a known planet: Dihlator, of the Centauri
462 Sector.  I had hoped that I could begin with a short hop, become accustomed
463 to the modified Passkey, then work my way up to larger jumps.
464 I took out a tube of synthetic nutri-pudding, and began to suck on it as I
465 looked around.  I began to walk slowly toward a huddled group of buildings,
466 just beyond a footbridge spanning a slowly flowing stream.

496     Was uncertain as to just what HAD happened.  He could analise the record-
497 ings later.  For now it was sufficiant to be on his way.  Elxtia sat beside him
498 in stunned silence.
499     He remembered communicating with several of the crew of Pell-Mell when for
500 no appearent reason his readouts went almost totaly wacko.  One blinking light
501 told of an interferance linkage betteween the field of that ships warp gen-
502 erators and his own.  His own plasma flywheel had all but wound down to its 
503 bottle, only the qork remained when some unknow sense prompted him, unthinking
504 , to initiate emergancy restart proceedures.  Had the nonmaterial effects of
505 his unusual 'stabelizer' played some part?  He'd know that when he played back
506 the automatic log.  Or would he?

508       Dreamtoucher was struggling to keep Snowrunner from rending the already
509 unconcios cat-like creature to small bloody shreads.
510       Only partialy calmed, he let her help, a fold of its nape in her strong
511 jaws, like some recalcitrant cub, to half drag, half carry, the now loudly 
512 snoring form to the edge of the entry, ware it was uncerimoniosly droped.
513       For all his quivering rabbit nerviosness, they found Zypher straingely
514 un-moved by the frightening spectical, brief though it was.  Eather the usagi
515 was scared stiff, or made of sterner stuff than eather the elf or his four 
516 footed companion had realized.
517      What had become, he wondered half out loud, of the INN's tranquill
518 sanctuary?  How many more such violant outbrakes would be tolerated or go un-
519 noticed?  Maybe trying to ignore them would cause them to go away.  He could
520 only hope.  That and stay alert.
521       Obviosly thair attacker had been unawaire of the elvin mystic's small
522 number of modest tallents.  Perhaps there were others here who did not realize
523 that though he had grown to maturaty and long passed on a world ware death 
524 unexpected, was a common backdrop, thanks to his abilities, unusual even among
525 his own people, ware sharp blades, strength of will, and magical inhieritance
526 were common, he had never killed, nor had to.  Nor would he lower himself to
527 do so now.  In time the intruder would awaiken, non the worse for wear and 
528 hopefuly just a tiny bit wiser.  At anyrate he hoped it was enjoying the dreams
529 he was sending it: from the dark side of its own conciosness.  A hard lesson
530 but some would learn from no other.
531      person, undisturbed by any of this had settled self closer to Wanderer, to
532 hear better the tale unfold.

537   The piper, weak from blood loss and exhaustion, sat on the elaborately inlaid
538 floor of the Pell-Mell, clutching his freshly opened wound, staring at Trainor's
539 actions.  He watched for long moments as the actions repeated themselves over
540 and over again -- first, Trainor would approach the door, hate twisting his
541 otherwise pleasant features into a grotesque mask.  Unsure of his intentions,
542 the piper, nevertheless, felt a slight twinge of worry as his hands raised to
543 the height of his chest to thrust open the door.  The look changed from hate
544 and rage to surprise as the door did not yeild easily to his push, changed to
545 determination as he drew back from the door and assulted it with his shoulder. 
546   Even rage and determination could not completely disguise the change in his
547 face when pain first overlay the hate.  The impact of flesh on the unyeilding
548 material of the door echoed through the Pell-Mell's hallway, the door slowly
549 swung partway open, releasing what seemed to be a glowing purple fog into the
550 hallway.  Then, smoothly, the purple radiance would withdraw into the room,
551 the door would close, first slowly, then more rapidly, throwing Trainor
552 back to his starting point with an unpleasant sound.  The awkward steps to
553 the door and twisting of features back through surprise to hate was not
554 pleasant, but the rapid backward walk down the hallway was unnerving.  The
555 piper watched the sequence repeat several times before he finally realized
556 what was happening: walk down hallway, palms to door, back up, assault door 
557 with shoulder, door opens slightly, purple mist appears, purple mist
558 withdraws, door returns Trainor to hallway, forward to door, palms on
559 door, walk backward down hallway.  Time after time the sequence repeated
560 itself, until the piper realized that Trainor had become caught in a
561 causation loop.

583      "Emu, Bard! Stop Trainor before he hurts himself!" Cragmore's words echoed
584 down the halls of the Pell-mell. Emu and Bard were still a bit stunned by 
585 Trainor's outbursts, but they complied. Bard grabbed Trainor by the arms, 
586 fighting back the flailing limbs as Emu, the shorter of the two, attempted
587 to entangle Trainor's legs. Like a man insane, Trainor fought his two
588 friends, but their efforts only redoubled as Trainor increased his resistance.
589 Finally, with the help of Cragmore, they subdued him, and with words of
590 reassurance, tried to calm him. Throughout this whole ordeal, Piper sat next
591 to the door, clutching his blood-soaked side, unable to render assistance to
592 the others because of his injuries.
593      "It is THAT woman in there! She destroyed my home and my people!" Trainor
594 sputtered like a man possessed, which he was, with hatred and desire for
595 revenge. "I have to kill her. There is no sanctity on my ship. She can not
596 hide from me or shirk her responsibility!"
597      "He's crazy!" Bard blurted. "Listen to him."
598      "Imagine youself put in his situation Bard. Everyone and everything you
599 know and love destroyed. He has kept his emotions under control until now. He
600 is focusing all of his hate on zeb because she is the one thing he relates to
601 the entity he released during his experiments with the Pell-mell. It may be
602 illogical but such a transfer is not uncommon in similar emotional situations.
603 Do you understand?"
604       "Yes I do understand Cragmore." replied Bard, applying slightly less
605 force to Trainor's shoulders to keep him pinned to the metal floor of the
606 ship. "What can we do with him?"
607       "We must try to reason with him. We must try to explain how things really
608 are, not how he sees things through eyes tinted with rage. And then we must
609 allow him to confront his nemisis alone. He must make the decision for himself.
610 We can only aid him in his journey, but we must leave him alone at his
611 destination."
612       "I agree, but it is dangerous. How can we be sure he won't hurt himself
613 or somebody else?" Emu asked.
614       "We can't, but we must risk it. First let's get Trainor into another one
615 of the sleeping chambers, and then we must get the door opened."
616       "Are you sure we can? Trainor nearly broke his neck trying to force
617 that door."
618       "Force is not the answer. It never is. There are other ways to get behind
619 a green door. Believe me."
