30 Good morning!  I have signed on a time ortwo to read and enjoy.  What a surprise
31 to come in and find no one here.  How often does this happen?  Is there any way 
32 to hear the stories that have gone on before?  
33 
34 Maybe I'll stop back by this evening and visit when someone has been here.  Talk
35 to you gents later.

41 "I'm probably gonna regret this, but count me in for the trip", said the bard. 
42 Rummaging in his pack he pulled out a rectangular object, which he examined
43 with care. "OK, the controller looks ready...."

47  ...d, my dear, how lovely to hear the twinkle of your laughter
48     again. Alas I left a note for you pinned to the taffrail, it's
49     somewhat weathered and worn but perhaps still readable.
50  ...Alex, indeed the search for Truth still goes on!!!  
51   
52    Imagine Nila's surprise when she returned to the grove where she
53    had slept to find a handsome young Prince there and furthermore
54    he had wrapped about his shoulders Nila's own rainbow cloak of
55    birds' feathers. He seemed quite embarrassed when Nila appeared.
56   
57    "Hello.", she said, "Are you cold?"
58   
59    Hastily the prince took the cloak from around his shoulders.
60    "Oh no!",he said, "I was just admiring your beautiful cloak. I
61    was imagining it belonged to a beautiful princess."
62   
63    "Yes it does.", Nila said politely, "Me, but you're quite
64     welcome to use it if you're chilly."
65   
66    "No, No", said the prince, "it's fine but the cloak is so much
67    more beautiful on you." He clasped the clasp about her throat
68    and stepped back admiringly. "Well now.", he said, "My name is
69    A'Lein. What's yours. You truly are very beautiful you know.
70   
71    "I'm the Princess Nila. I'm very wise too. At least everybody
72    at home says so, but I don't feel very wise at the moment.",
73    she sighed. "I'm searching for Truth you see."
74   
75    "That's interesting.", said the Prince A'Lein, "So am I. Since
76    we have both come here it must be very nearby."
77   
78    "Perhaps.", said Nila just a little sadly. She was beginning to
79    realize that things were not always as they seem to be.
80   
81    "But it must be nearby.", said A'Lein, "You see, I've had all 
82    the right adventures. There was the old witch with her strange
83    music and a prophesy when I was born, and a dreadful dragon
84    on the way..."
85   
86    "Oh, for me it was a ragged musician and an flippant frog.",
87    Nila said.
88   
89    "Oh!", said the Prince, "I suppose it's different for girls."
90    After a moment he added, "To tell you the truth, I don't feel
91    any closer to Truth than when I started out. You wouldn't have
92    a bite to eat about would you?"
93   
94    "There's some very nice fruit here in the grove", Nila said,
95    "and the water from the fountain."
96   
97    "It's a Magic Fountain I imagine?", said the Prince.
98   
99    "Why, yes", said Nila, "but how did you know?"
100   
101    "It figures.", A'Lein muttered to himself. It had to be. He
102    said no more about it.
103   
104    They ate the fruit of the grove laughing as the luscious juice
105    trickled down their fingers and the sweet water of the fountain.
106    They were very content. It was very pleasant to forget about
107    searching for awhile just to eat and drink and enjoy each others
108    company in the natural course of events.

113      Tick... Tick... Tick...
114      Just like grandmother's old alarm clock...
115      I had that sinking feeling in my gut -- This was not going to be a good
116 day.  The bomb squad had arrived.  Men in blue jumpsuits huddled around the
117 package in my office.  Their leader, Sgt. Banks, gave his orders in hushed,
118 professional tones.  Sgt. Banks and I are friends, sort of.  But more on 
119 that later.  The water cannon was in place.  Banks herded us into the 
120 hallway.  My disquiet increased...
121      A water cannon is an amazing device.  A 12" stainless steel tube which
122 propels 6 oz. of water 3400 ft/sec. by means of a black powder charge.  By
123 the time the water hits the suspected bomb, it's almost steam.  In theory
124 it destroys the detonater before it has a chance to trigger the bomb.  Some
125 theory.
126      So I sat in the hallway watching the paint peel off the wall... 
127 Wondering if I'd have an office left.  Banks was ready... I wasn't... Oh,
128 God... here we go...
129                   K A B O O M ! ! !
130      The building seemed to be still standing.  We rushed into the office.
131 I couldn't stand the suspense; "Well, was it a bomb?"
132      Banks poked through the jumbled mess... "It appears the suspected 
133 device may have been an alarm clock."
134     "What type of explosive?"
135      "No explosive, just the clock."
136      W"What! Let me look."  I poked through the pile of junk.  That dial 
137 face looked familiar.  Of course, grandmother's old alarm clock.  The old
138 broad must have sent it to me.  I saw red.
139      Banks was talking to his bomb technicians; "Well, another suspected
140 device disposed of by approved methods." (Bomb team talk)
141      My mouth overloaded; "Banks, you <expletive deleted>, you blew up my
142 grandmother's alarm clock."
143      He smiled, "Tough luck Salazar, but I owed you for the peanut butter
144 in my shoes."
145     He left me sputtering.  Serena was cracking up in the corner.  Tears
146 running down her face.  I knew this wasn't going to be a good day.
147 -------O--------
148      A couple of hours later I was headed to the Hutton estate for a little
149 legwork.  The rain had stopped.  Grudgingly, I have to admit the Portland
150 sparkles like a jewel when the sun shines.  What's this up ahead?
151 USED BOLO LOT... Men in saffron hawking used arms.  A brave band of 
152 adventurers sneaking around.  They're on their own for now.  I'm confused,
153 which reality is this?  I keep driving.  The Hutton estate is up ahead.
154 Looks huge... Nice place to get lost in.  I hope my day improves...
155 More later.
156 !~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!Valinor!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~

158 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  *.*  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
159 
160    They bantered with each other and all the jokes meant you are
161    beautiful to me. They sang all the songs they knew and each
162    song meant you are beautiful to me. They chatted about their
163    lives and compared notes on Kings and Palaces and gardens and
164    logic and adventures on the search for Truth.
165   
166    "But you see", said the Prince, "everything seems to comes out
167    just the way you thought it would. To tell you the truth I was
168    even sort of expecting to run into a beautiful Princess right
169    about now. Do you suppose? I hope you won't take offense. Do
170    you suppose you might be a figment of my own imagination?"
171   
172    "I don't think so", Nila said, "but it would be all right anyway,
173    because I rather like the person I am in your imagination, and
174    that would mean I create you in my imagination too, you know.
175    Perhaps we make each other in our waking dreams."
176   
177    "Well it all certainly seems real enough", A'Lein said, "and I
178    guess all we've got to go on is how things seem."
179   
180    "Yes", Nila said, "I know what you mean. From the palace it 
181    seemed the place were East began was right here, because it was
182    as far east as I could see."
183   
184    "Well, seeming and being are two different things.", A'Lein
185    said, "and anyway you've got the directions wrong. The old witch
186    said Truth was concealed at the place where West begins."
187   
188    "It was East I'm sure!", said Nila, "so I've been traveling
189    toward the rising sun."
190   
191    "No", the Prince answered, "it was West and I've been traveling
192    toward the setting sun. I follow my shadow in the morning and
193    the sun in the afternoon."
194   
195    "And I do just the opposite.", Nila said wonderingly, "Which of
196    us is right then?"
197   
198    Instinctively both looked up for their faithful guide the sun but
199    they had played away the morning together and the sun was
200    motionless above in the bright sky, neither rising nor setting.
201    It was perfect noon and they cast no shadows outside themselves.
202   
203    "But is there still an East or West?", Nila said wonderingly.
204   
205    "Yes of course", said A'Lein excitedly, "look Nila look, don't
206    you see? You are the place where East begins, because in front
207    of you is East, behind you is west. You are the very place
208    between that is neither East nor West. Then Nila understood that
209    East and West were not in the outside world at all. Inside
210    herself was the beginning and end of both East and West, and
211    she seemed to hear the sound of many voices saying.
212   
213    "Don't look outside yourself for something that lies only within."
214   
215    ...and looking within she found the very Place Where East Begins,
216       and the thirst quenching fountain that was there
217    ...and she was Happy  ...Happy   ...Happy
218   
219    It was a long time later or perhaps no time at all, when the
220    Prince A'Lein and the Princess Nila began to wend their way down
221    from the Enchanted Hills. They walked very close together as one
222    under the shining cloak of birds' feathers. Behind them on the
223    flower-jeweled slope there was the faint humming of a million
224    invisible bees seeking nectar.
225   
226           The answers' in the question, ho!
227           The taste is in the thirst.
228           Which truth seeker, Oh!
229           Will reach Truth First?
230   
231           Some travel to the East, ho!
232           And some go to the West.
233           But the farthest truth of all, Oh!
234           Is neither East nor West.

262 
263 Alex, d:  Thank you for your most gracious greeting.  This must be about
264 the third transmission which I've claimed to probably be my last.  Well
265 this time I'm sure.  See you again when I become established in Tokyo and
266 extravagant enough to call for an up&download (Three months or so).
267 
268 Piper (I presume):  I have at times (nonverbally) questioned the signi-
269 ficance of the ramblings of fantasy and fairy tales that have pervaded
270 this system recently.  I have, until now however, declined comment in that
271 regard, noting that there seemed to be those who somehow found some kind
272 of relevance to something somewhere.  I find it very difficult to imagine
273 however, how a multiplicity of LF's, spaces and periods can have signi-
274 ficance to anyone.  I suggest that in the future you have a little con-
275 cideration for other users.  (Departing
276 gripe.)
277 
278 CYM:  Let yourself not be discouraged by the ramblings of these minors.
279 There are many among them who seek enlightenment.  If persons such as 
280 yourself and myself do not volunteer our patience and our realistic view
281 of life and the universe, they will turn, for guidance to the first eager
282 recruit (usually of religious persuasion) they can find.  It is much easier
283 to prevent cancer (of a physiological or moral nature) than to cure it.
284 
285 ALL:  On previous disks I have avoided discussions of economic matters, as
286 they seemed to consist largely of political viewpoints, and I el-
287 ected not to display my political ignorance.  It is my contention that many,
288 in fact most, of the economic ailments of this society have very little to do
289 with politics.  Many have complained of Reagans ineffectivenes with regard
290 to the economy.  I too am rather perturbed at the aforementioned Pres, but
291 not because of his ineffectiveness.  I have never held the slightest hope of
292 any individual (even one of normal intellegence) having a significant ef-
293 fect on the economy.  My distaste for the aforementioned stems mostly from
294 his multitudinous campaign promises which he knew, or at least should have
295 known, he could not possibly fulfill.
296      I believe that, in general, the economic ills of this society are ele-
297 mental to the extent that attitude changes on the part of the general pop-
298 ulace, rather than policy changes, are required for recovery.
299      Anthropologists believe that humankind would have faced extiction long
300 ago had it not been for social trends within the species.  Man began to 
301 think of himself not as much as an individual with all others regarded as
302 external objects, but more as a member of a family and/or society.  This
303 hairless, physiologically fragile creature is simply not adequately suited
304 for self-defence, predation, nor for coping with the environment on an in-
305 dividual basis.  In societies where the social structure is decaying due
306 to a return of individualistic trends, famine is inevitable.
307 The US, I believe, is one such society.
308      Many have labored considerably analyzing the economic differences,
309 and causes thereof, between US and Japan; and many such causes have been
310 identified.  At the root of all these causes, however, is this trend of
311 individualization and its devastating by-product, greed.  In this society,
312 the individual has vastly superceded in personal significance, the family,
313 the society (nation), and the species; thus, resulting in an inflated drive
314 for self preservation and severe neglect for family and species preserv-
315 ation, which, in turn, undermines the former drive.
316      Japanese, however, tend to think of themselves first as human, sec-
317 ond as Japanese, third as a member of their family and last and least as
318 an individual.  Some of the effects of these differences are easily il-
319 lustrable.
320      Consider first the American disregard for commitments and respons-
321 ibilities.  Such are honored only when it is convenient or advantageous to
322 the individual to do so.  In my recent preparations to move, I have had to
323 make a vast number of appointments with various people.  On the basis of
324 those appointments, I have found that about 92% simply don't show up, and
325 of those, 80% are late.  How can we expect business to function efficient-
326 ly with such a mutual disregard for our business associates time.
327      I also recall a time when my family was in the grocery business (1957-
328 1972?) and the customer enjoyed even greater respect from the employee than
329 did the employer; in deed, the customer is the employer's employer.  In
330 Japan this is still readily recognized.  As one barely sets foot in a typ-
331 ical Japanese store, he is immediately greeted with a very polite yet 
332 friendly "Irasshaimase, nani wo sashiagemashoo ka?"; which is similar to
333 the tone with which a commoner would speak to the emperor.  Shopping is a
334 much more inviting activity in such an environment than one in which the
335 customer is generally ignored until he makes his existence unavoidable to
336 the employee, at which time he receives something like "Yeah, whattayawant?"
337     Perhaps appreciation of the customer, or lack thereof, is related to
338 the level of pride with which one's work is regarded.  I suddenly realize
339 that I have ommitted one of the important social groups within the heirarchy
340 of the Japanese social structure.  The typical Japanese person and family
341 also considers itself a member of the company by which he/they are employed.
342 Such an inclusion is a natural consequence of the lifetime commitment 
343 mutually enjoyed by employer and employee.  When one changes employers on
344 a roughly annual basis, as in the US, it is difficult to attain any degree
345 of comittment toward that company and therefore, to take pride in your
346 quality (and quantity) of work.
347      A third example of the ill effects of individualization is the western
348 affinity for luxury.  The computer industry illustrates this.  Japanese
349 computer manufacturers have had difficulty establishing an export market
350 to the US.  One of the reasons is the stress on simplicity, functionality
351 and as a result, affordability of Japanese designs.  The american consumer
352 though, compares the various models of computers on the market by counting
353 and comparing the number of knobs, switches, buttons and lights thereon.
354 The result is the purchase of a device which far exceeds their needs and
355 their budget.
356      Many other examples of such side-effects of individualization could
357 be cited, but the essence of my arguement is that a successful individual
358 depends on a successful family which depends on a successful company (em-
359 ployer) which depends on a successful nation (society) which depends on the
360 success of the human race in general.
361 The individual who gives a damn about noone and nothing but the individual
362 condemns to poverty (economic, emotional, etc.) the individual and makes a
363 sizable contribution toward a similar fate for the upper levels of social
364 organization.
365      I sincerely hope that the members of this society someday recognize
366 their interdependance and the fallacy of mutually destructive individual
367 competition.  Until then, not even McGovern can save us (you).
368       
369      Well, I've thought long and hard about my final words on BWMS.  I've
370 written, rewritten, edited, re-edited and rehearsed diligently and repeat-
371 edly; but I don't want to keep you waiting too long, so here they are:

390 Dear Mr. Figment:
391      Not withstanding your affinity for hamsters and duck tape, I did 
392 find a good amount of humor in your thoroughly tasteless jokes.  I
393 personally would enjoy some more.  Just don't use terms like 
394 <expletive deleted>.  They may offend some.
395 Dear Piper:
396      I for one found your line feeds, periods, etc. quite creative.
397 Perhaps those who complain are suffering from a lack of fantasy.

404 The piper sighed a sigh of deep relief and followed the others to the OTHER
405 back room.  Waiting while the bard finished his request, he asked,
406 "Are you really going to the BOLO lot?  If so, please tread lightly, and
407 good luck!"
408 Moving into the room, he thanked the apprentice, "thanks, you have a quick
409 mind and good ears!  The only residue from the drug is a slight tingling
410 that is fading fast.... and... I haven't been this sober for several hours.
411 I think we had better get moving.  If the hairy fish-nuts are not the 
412 problem, we don't know who our adversary is, while they have proven they
413 know who we are.  Wasn't there a lady Lynn? One who was going to lead the
414 expedition to the Wizard?  Has anyone seen her?"
415 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
416 
417 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?
418 DOM: WELL PUT....IN PART. OF COURSE WE HAVE SIMILAR IN ONE WAY AND YET
419 OPPOSITE IN ANOTHER, VIEWS TOWARD RELIGION. MOST OF IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE
420 PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD. BUT LET'S FACE IT, SO DOES THE OTHER SIDE. THE TWO
421 LARGEST GROUPS OF PEOPLE, STATISTICALLY, ARE EITHER INVOLVED IN SOME
422 FORM OF SO CALLED CHRISTIANITY, OR ARE IRRELEGIOUS. (athiest, agnostic)
423 THERE ARE 1,433,000,000 THATCLAIM THE FIRST, AND 911,000,000 THAT CLAIM
424 NONRELIGIOUS STATUS. THEN WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
425 REFUSES TO REMOVE NAMES FROM THERE BAPTISMAL ROLES, FOR INSTANCE IF 
426 SOMEONE CHANGES RELIGIONS, QUITS THEIRS, OR DIES, THIS NUMBER WOULD 
427 ACTUALLY BE SOMEWHAT SMALLER FOR THE SUPPOSED CHRISTIANS. 
428 ANYHEY, THE POINT IS BOTH GROUPS CONTRIBUTE THE LARGEST EFFECTS. IDEA
429 WISE. SO THE SELFISH PREVELENT ATTITUDES CAN BE BLAMED ON BOTH. BUT IF
430 A PERSON TRULY LIVES UP TO THE TEACHINGS IN THE BIBLE, AND APPLIES IT'S
431 PRINCIPLES, AND RULES THEIR LIVES BY IT'S LAWS......THEN THEY WOULD BE 
432 LIKE THE INDIVIDUALS YOU DESCRIBE. THEY WOULD BE HUMAN 1ST, EARTHLING 2ND,
433 MEMBER OF A FAMILY 3RD, AND THEN FOURTH AND LASTLY INDIVIDUAL.
434 GHANDI MADE A GOOD POINT WHEN SAID THAT IF THE WORLD WOULD GET TOGETHER
435 ON THE TEACHINGS IN THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT (Matthew 5,6) THAT IT COULD
436 SOLVE THE WORLD PROBLEMS. READ IT.......IT COULD!
437 I WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH MANY OF THE YOUTH IN THE PORTLAND AREA, AND IF
438 YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT INDIVIDUALISTIC TRENDS, THEY'RE A GOOD START. FO
439 THE MOST PART THEY HAVE NO BELIEF IN A GOD, BELIEVE IN EVOLUTION, AND 
440 THEREFORE FEEL THERE IS NOTHING TO ANSWER TO, AND DO THERE OWN THING.
441 IN OTHER WORDS, THE MAIN TENOR IS EAT, DRINK, AND BE MERRY FOR TOMORROW
442 WE SHALL DIE. THIS IS AN OVER SIMPLIFICATION, I REALIZE, BUT I'M LIMIT-
443 ED TIME WISE. WE ALL KNOW THE FAILINGS OF FALSE CHRISTIANS, BUT LET'S 
444 TAKE A REALISTIC LOOK AT THE FRUITS OF THE OTHER SIDE, TOO. BOTH HAVE
445 VALID POINTS, AND BOTH HAVE SERIOUS FAILINGS.
446 I THINK I GOT UP ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BED THIS MORN.
447 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?DEBORAH?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

450 Oh my,have you people seen the bathroom in this place?
451 You walk in to this little room an your in this Roman bath!
452 I have never had so much fun getting clean,there is a small
453 language problem though.
454 did anyone miss me?

461 The bard suddenly realized that the apprentice was staring at him.
462 Looking down at his pack he saw why. When he'd pulled out the controller,
463 his ID had fallen out. It had landed with the orange A-arrow symbol showing.
464 Damn! He swiftly replaced the card in the pack. 
465 "Look," he whispered to the apprentice, "I know the Guild
466 doesn't get along with us, but I think outtime weapons fall more in our 
467 department." At the apprentice's skeptical look he continued, "Does 
468 'NEMSEC five' mean anything to you?"
469 The apprentice gave a start.
470 "Good, I see it does. Perhaps we can discuss this later..."
471 "Oh, thanks for the hangover cure!"
472 
473 He watched as those who weren't going to the lot, entered the back
474 room. Funny, there hadn't been a door there before. No matter he'd seen 
475 stranger things since he left Ouray Center. Someday he might find the Center
476 again (& it might even be the RIGHT Center!).

479     
480     I was thinking of other topics of interest that could be 
481 discussed on this board and couldn't think of anything that 
482 either everybody pretty much agreed on, or nothing could be
483 gained by bringing it up (the only exception I could think of
484 being religion ).   What subjects are there that tend tg lead
485 to a great deal of varing opinions, and can be discussed 
486 reasonably?
487 
488 
489 Reveiw:
490    Religion: many varing opinions, tends to get well thought
491          out arguments from all sides.
492    Sex: was discussed recently but everybody who participated 
493          seemed to agree.
494    Time Travel: Interesting, but no new theories presented, 
495          unless someone out there hes a time machine nothing
496          can really be proven.
497    Reagan & Economics: Recently introduced, well just have to see.
501 
502     Ah well...  I'll just sit in a corner table, order a drink
503 and keep my ears open, maybe things will heat up.
504 
505 Mikey: as commented on before this system does not tend to like 
506  uploads, could this be a result of the speed of your
507  'enter' routine?
508 
509 ======================================================-Evan-======
510 
511 Bard:
512     Oh boy, it looks like it's just me and you. We'll have a good time.
513 Maybe I'll even let you borrow my old stick shift. Good fun! I hope you
514 can write a song for the occasion. We'll be a good team. 
515 
516 Any other nice people want to come?
517                    The Ninja
518 P.S. I'll bring some raw shark. It's good stuff.
519 The Poet turned to the short fellow in black who called himself 'Ninja'
520 and said, "You're not paying enough attention, son. Greymalkin and the 
521 Geologist are going to the BOLO lot, too. As for myself, I'm not much 
522 in a fight, but even less for tact, so I'd better join you too. At least
523 BOLOs aren't as touchy as wizards. I am also better suited to espionage
524 than frontal confrontation."
525 Turning to the Apprentice, he shook his head. "I'm more sober now than 
526 I've been in a very long time. I don't know whether to thank you or punch
527 you in the nose. Anyway," he turned to the assembled group, "I think we'd
528 best be off. Our enemies obviously know where we are, and so we are 
529 safest if we keep moving. See you at the lot!" 
530 So speaking, the Mad One stepped back into the shadows and seemed to
531 vanish. There was a moment of quiet confusion in the room, and then he 
532 reappeared with a sheepish look on his face.
533 "Uh...which way did you say that BOLO lot was?"
