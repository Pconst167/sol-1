24         The Sage and his chess companion huddled over their board.  The sun
25 was hidden behind clouds as it set over the horizon, and the birds were landing
26 in the nests.

27         The Odd One sat tense, and his fingers looked as if they might crush a
28 piece rather than simply move it.  The Sage though was sitting peacefully, and
29 did not seem to be scrutinizing the borard as much as the Odd One.

30         Finally, the Odd One snapped out and moved his peice, while grunting
31 something about Checkmate.  Then he made sure of it, a pathetic sight to see
32 someone gloatingly observing their handy work.
33  
34         The Odd One noticed at that moment that the Sage was not even paying
35 attention to the game, but was congratulating his opponent on his game.  An
36 odd thing for someone to do, thought the Odd One.

37         Later that night, after iconsidering it, Odd One decided that the Sage
38 was exhibiting the fine quality of sportsmanship, while he had been scavenging
39 his mind for every scrap of strategy.

40         There was little question as to who enjoyed the game more.

47   you know a movie is in trouble when the audience laughes during the serious 
48 parts.  You know a movie is REALLY in trouble when the audience laughes during
49 the love scenes.
50 This is not a movie to see if you expect to take it seriously.  The acting is bad,
51 and the editing is worse.  Special effects are fairly well done (Dykstra -
52 Star Trek I & Silent Running?).  The alien spaceship looks Very much like the
53 one from Alien (internal), crossed with V'ger (Star Trek I, exterior).
54 LOTS of blood, gore, more blood, dessicated bodies, blood, more dessicated bodies,
55 and bad acting.
56 The one redeeming feature (for some of us, anyway), is that the female lead,
57 Mathilda May, is nude through almost the entire movie.  Even that gets a bit
58 much, though, eliciting more laughter from the audience.  
59 I'd give it a "can miss".
60 ----------------------------Not FILM FAN-------------------------------------
61   just a note to the Not FILM FAN: and Mathilda May is only attractive to those
62 of us that like women in pancake make-up that have red pupils.

71     A cold breeze flurried in as the door to the Inn opened. A lone figure, wrapped in furs and carrying a sword entered 
72 and sat down. He ordered some ale and some "fish(?). The warm fire crackled, singing it's song that only the empathetic 
73 could hear. People looked at him strangelhen he didn't remove his furs. He drank his ale and sat back, 
74 his face shadowed by a plumed and feathered hat. He listened to the fire, felt it's heat against him. He relaxed. After 
75 that spot of hunting he had done, he needed a bit of relaxation. People all around him were wondering WHY this newcomer 
76 didn't remove his coat. It was then, to their amazement, that they realized that he wasn't wearing a coat, the coat was 
77 ON HIM! `"Top o' the evenin', mate!" Mudge (the newcomer) said to the inneekeeper. "Wot be 'appenin' 'round 'ere that I 
78 might be interested in? I'm an 'unter. Is there much game 'round here?"

91      "This is your captain speaking.  We're now entering Australian air space.
92 The landscape we are passing over is dotted with sheep ranches, kangaroos,
93 and..."  Petrov, mesmerized by the thought of ranch-hopping in a land with
94 softer animal protection laws, tuned out the captain's voice.  His attention 
95 alternated between the window and a brochure in his hand which read:
96           Bruce's Sheep Ranch
97          World famous home of
98         Australian Virgin Wool
99 
100      Unfortunately, from ecstasy to anguish in a matter of seconds, Petrov's
101 anticipation was crushed by a vile act of terrorism.  A heavily armed man with
102 a half-grown beard grabbed the microphone from a startled stewardess.  "Due to
103 circumstances beyond your control this airplane will not be landing in Sydney.
104 We are now headed for Albania.  You have only your decadent, capitalistic 
105 lifestyle to thank for this problem."
106      Two more armed men entered the compartment and the one who seemed to be
107 the leader took control of the intercom.  "I'm sure you're all wondering what 
108 your weak, capitalistic governments are going to have to do to keep us from
109 blowing your decadent, capitalistic heads off of your bourgeois, capitalistic
110 shoulders."
111      Getting dangerously excited, the third terrorist interrupted the leader
112 and, thrusting his rifle triumphantly into the air, proclaimed "We are FALO!!"
113      Petrov needed to hear no more.  While the terrorists began waving their
114 weapons menacingly and shouting at the passengers, Petrov reviewed what he knew
115 about FALO.
116      After the fall of McKane Industries, many of the empire's crumbling
117 companies were taken over by certain aggressive Japanese conglomerates.  One
118 such troubled company was Albanian Earmuffs Unlimited, which raised and h
119 harvested small furry animals for obvious purposes.  Rising in protest of furry
120 animal exploitation was the Furry Animal Liberation Organization, or FALO.
121 
122      "You," the leader said, grabbing a stewardess by the arm.  "You will go
123 through the passenger list and pick out all of the Japanese names.  We have
124 special treatment planned for them!"
125      What name am I using THIS time?  Petrov wondered.  Pulling the passport
126 from his purse, he read: KIM LEE HIROSAKI.  It figured.  There was nothing to
127 do but sit, wait, and wonder if there were any sheep in Albania.
128                               Petrov

159     in an oddly contoured chair, in an odly contoured room a LARGE soft furry
160 citti unfolded his front pads, retracting, symultaniosly his overnails.
161     the fingers, six per hand, one thumb each, one midwrist dewclaw, now fully
162 extended rested lightly on the two pairs
163 of three rows of six keys.
164     long agile delicat fingers flayed subtle at the keycaps.  On the screen an
165 immage formed.  It grew in detail and completeness.
166     Reflected in the eyes of that feline face, itself reflected on the screen's
167 surface.  Three soft fluffy small mammels ran across a field.  Suddenly a door
168 opened in mid air.  They jumped through.   At the same time citti's reflexon
169 dissappeared.  The cross current intersection was wide open, if only for the
170 briefest of instants.  That was as long as he needed!
171       Fingers forgotten, the great dark furred form leaped, clawing his way
172 over keyboard and through suddenly yealding opening.
173       Steady as a rok, citti landed on all fours on the oaken flooring of the
174 INN!
175       He turned to one of otter vissage.  'I have many forms, this one is new'
176 the great feloid spoke in remarkably gentle and human sounding voice.  'You were
177 looking for a certain Lananaran?'
178       'I see you in new form, will this form of mine do?  I don't even know 
179 what its capabilities are yet.  I've only
180 just now tried it on for the first time.'
181      'Lets find a table, tried the INN's best yet?'
182      'Two specials please' he asked of the INNkeeper, lying a huge galactic nin-
183 gy on the counter in payment.  this was only possible owing to the INN's unique
184 aggreement with time and space.
185      in a corner a small twisted tough leathery form played on a ceramic rube
186 goldburg what came out sounding to each listner their favorite most exciting AND
187 pleasing sounds.

204    A small furry white creature entered from the door that had been left 
205 ajar by the otter. He seemed to float across the ground as he walked. His 
206 antenna bobbed a bit. An energy flux floated past and the little Hoojib ate it
207 hungrily. He hadn't tasted a good energy flux in ydays. Out searching for his 
208 comerad kept him fmehnjvjjbnbf
209 (sorry about line interferance)
210 comerad kept him from enjoying such pleasures. Hoojib examined the room he was
211 in. An otter drinking and telling a tale. A catling paying the Innkeeper. He 
212 turned abruptly whenn the familiar sound of a duar permeated his senses.
213   "Probably their villiage Minstrel and not the one I seek* thought Pliff (the
214 Hoojib) But he knew for sure that he was wrong when the voice so familiar to 
215 him said "Pliff! You ol' son of a gun! Where have you been?" Pliff smiled and 
216 sthought *Hi Minstrel! I've been around. Your songs are the same as always! 
217 What have you been up to sincewe parted?* The Minstrel smiled and plucked a 
218 string of his duar. "Singing, living, Dyig, Laughing, and crying. " he said. 
219 *Ahh..the same riddle personality I see!* said Pliff. Pliff hopped up on the 
220 Minstrel's shoulder. Plucking a tune on his duar, the Minstrel smiled.

250 "Gods save us! 'tis a TWIT!" The twit 
251 laughed, pulling out a duar and playing horrible notes. Then the twit took on
252 the appearance of the Minstrel.
253      It then began to scrawl messages allover the walls of the Inn. It 
254 danced in evil glee. It bobbed and swayed and played it'S evil duar.

266 	You will hear everyday the maximums of a low prudence. 
267 You will hear that the first duty is to get land and money, 
268 place and name. "What is this truth you seek? What is this beauty?"
269 men will ask with derision. If, nevertheless, God has called any
270 of you to explore truth and beauty, be bold, be firm, be true.
271 When you shall say, "As others do, so will I. I renounce, I am
272 sorry for it, my early visions; I let learning and romantic 
273 expectations go, until a more convenient season"; - then dies

275 and science, as they have died already in a thousand men.

344 And I'm goi~g to prove it!
345  Blue Waters
346 By the Minstrel
347 Blue waters on the face of Earth,
348 they mix with moonlight making, conjuring,
349 Caling forth good souls,
350 to drink from them.
351  
352 Moonlit waters on the Earth,
353 Like moonlit hearts in lovers,
354 Turn and intertwine together,
355 to form something different,
356 something new.
357 Moonlit waters.
358  
359 Blue waters running down a hill,
360 singino a song of olden times,
361 Until our hearts have had their fill,
362 and txe waters recoil to their homes,
363 In the rivers and lakes,
364 So much like a human's soul.
365 Fi 
366 There. That should prove WHO the Minstrel is!
367 @*@*@*@*@*@*@ The actual Minstrel @*@*@
368 
369 THIS IS SAD!  All this 'junk' about the two Minstrels, I think I'm going to 
370 throw up! What is it looks like here is that the Minstrel wasn't getting the
371 attention that he wanted. So now he has created an alter ego that's pretending
372 to be another Minstrel. And above all that, they are arguing between himself.
373 Sounds funny, but it's still a little weird. I just hope his psychologist is
374 wearing a flack jacket...

377 
378 @*@*@*@*@*@ The saddened Minstrel @*@*@*@
379 Anumi: I assure you that I am NOT the other minstrel. That person is the
380 one who should be locked up. I simply wish to write. To sing, live, and laugh.
381 and cry. I didn't want attention. I wanted comments. I got them. But I don't 
382 see why this person had to do what he has done.
383 @*@*@*@*@*@*@ The Depressed Minstrel @*@
384 -------------
385 Gosh,why doesn't the Minstrel just move into Mike's home and use the system
386 24 hours a day. It looks like he has done that already, he just sits around
387 and waits for mail. If he writes in after this I'm with Anumi!
388 -------------
389 The problem with the two Minstrels reminds me of the biblical story of Solomon
390 and the  baby. Two women were claiming possession of the child, so Solomon 
391 decided to split the baby in half so each woman would have an equal share.
392 Since we seem to have to people here, each claiming to be The Minstrel, and
393 each wanting the other to depart, I suggest they BOTH leave.  Justice would
394 be served, and BackWater would be a better place with one less source of
395 bad 'poetry'.

411 A suggestion to keep peace: how about just limiting entries to about 50 lines
412 per disk?  That way more people could make entries.  This is the first time in
413 two days I've been able to log on to Backwater.

433     Poetry is very nice to reed when it is good. Feelings and emotions should
434 be a big part when writing poetry also. And the poetry brings out emotions and
435 helps us see some things that were foggy before.  I like to feel that I have 
436 learned something or that I feel better about myself after reading poetry.
437     When poetry sounds like a old football re-run, just goes on and on, it is
438 missing something that poetry is known for.  When I find myself skipping lines
439 hoping to get to the good part something is either wrong with me, or the 
440 poetry, I would like to think it's not me.
441     Write poetry if you like it and think others will like it too.  Just
442 throwing something out in a hurry gives not only your own poetry a bad name but
443 all of the other poems that haven't been entered yet.
444     I like poetry, I realy do!  But when it makes me wish I was doing something
445 other than reading it, it makes me think I'm crazy for liking poetry.

447 Mudge: I'm *extremely* surprised that you don't like the Minstrel.
448 Minstrel(both): I can tell the difference between the two of you. I will not
449 disclose the technique here or the impostor will start doing it...
450 I have msgs for Minstrel & Mudge on the Messenger (yes, I know who you are).

452         A figure entered the Inn. Upon spotting the otter, he knew that he 
453 ad found the person his master had spoken of. He went over to the table and
454 spoke.
455         "Art thou Mudge?"
456         The otter tensed up as he replied, "And who wants to know?"
457         "Ah! From what my master has said of you only, only you would
458 respond in such a manner."
459         "Now wait just a minute, guvnor!"
460         "Mudge.... must I use a spell to confirm your identity? And let the
461 entire Inn know?"
462         "#%^$#^&"
463         "I shall assume that you are indicating that you do not want the
464 rest of the patrons to know. My master was contacted by Clothahump..."
465         "Oh no ye don't! I'm not gettin' involved w'th the likes of HIM
466 again!" protested the otter.
467         "Clothahump has no interest in you, he was merely relaying a msg 
468 from a 'Jon-Tom'"

500    Charmicael and Freida (his brain-dead van) raced south accross the Black 
501 Rock Desert.  He didn't see any black rocks and it wasn't a true desert.
502    (The name comes from large tuffa formations that look dark off in the dis-
503 tance.  While much of the area is anciant salt flats, these prehistoric lake-
504 beds are surrounded by a vast unearthly landscape of stunted sage.  Geographic-
505 ly it is situated north of Gerlock which is north of Perimid Lake (Paiut res-
506 ervation) and south of Denio (which is near the Oregon boarder) and encompases 
507 vertualy the entire area)
508     20 miles north of Gerlock agent Sean turned off the main highway (little 
509 more than a wash-board jeep trail itself at this point) onto what appeared to 
510 be no more than a pair of tire tracks heading off into the seemingly endless 
511 distance.  The east slope of the Sierra's which looked to be in walking distance
512 but was actualy well over 80 miles away was angleing in from the right.
513     Suddenly the road diped down about 40 feet, as if to cross the bottem of one
514 of the ubiquotus arroyos.  Instead the depression proved large enough to hide a
515 small town were anyone who had ever seen it foolish enough to consider building
516 one here.  Not bloody likely.
517      Near it's other side was what appeared to be some sort of dyke or levee,
518 obviosly man-made.  The sand and rust encrusted end loader setting immobile as 
519 a statue nearby.  As Carmichael approached, the road turned and wound its way 
520 to the left fallowing the man-made embankment on arround. 
521       Within two hundreed feet of the opening but close enough to the bank of 
522 the angle to hide frieda from enquiring eyes (as if the dust storm of his ap-
523 proach haddn't revealed his prescence to one and all).
524       Suddenly the sky was filled with the looming preasence of a Space-Going
525 merchant container ship, probably of vermillion registry and crew, obviosly of
526 lananaran manufacture.  That is obvios to Carmichael only because of his 
527 connection with Themnax's 'embassy'.  This trade was still highly secret and 
528 even NET was unawaire of it's off world origen!  To most of humanity, extra-
529 terrestrial commerce is a highly questionably and speculative myth viewed with
530 suspecion of it's suggester's less than total sanity.  Motivations to keep it 
531 secret are many and a few are even passing legitimate.  Thus any vessle plying 
532 this trade must remain fully cloaked to all spectra until well within designated
533 safe areas.  The nevada desert hides many secrets, some known only to a hand-
534 full of persons in one government agcency or another, many more unknown to any 
535 agency of any government.
536     The remote site ware Carmichael must now elude guards and some-how warn the
537  non-human crew that security had been compromised and to turn back, was such a
538 'secret'.

542 John looked over the report he held in his hands once again.  He sighed
543 briefly, wondering if he'd committed a grevious sin recently that would require
544 such retribution.  The papers outlined a previously unknown trade with other
545 races, ALIEN races.  Just what he needed, another way for the government to
546 spend the money he was trying to save.  For his department, of course.
547 Well, there was nothing to do for it.  His best agents were all on assignment,
548 in a base near San Fransisco.  John sighed again, and hoped that Arjusk's
549 crazy idea was going to work.  Imagine!  Trade with aliens!  That material
550 should be handled by this department, John decided, or stopped.  Perhaps he
551 could finagle the accquisition of some of the items in question, then decide.
552 He pressed his AGENT CALL button.  "Weaver?  In my office, please."
