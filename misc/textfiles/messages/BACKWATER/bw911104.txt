 37 what???  The only John Q. Public on Father's Sunday "City Hall" program was
 38 cut off pronto <we'll have none of THAT <- which was, of course, the REAL
 39 problem>.  I guess the Governor's open forum was closed tight, though.  All 
 40 news crews were kicked out of the REAL "discussion" and were only allowed to
 41 hear her speech.  So is OPB gonna broadcast this "open forum" for us or are

 75 CLEAN CUT KID
 76  
 77 Everybody wants to know why he couldn't adjust
 78 Adjust to what, a dream that bust?
 79  
 80 He was a clean-cut kid
 81 But they made a killer out of him.
 82 That's what they did
 83  
 84 They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is
 85 They put ideas in his head he thought were his
 86  
 87 He was a clean-cut kid
 88 But they made a killer out of him.
 89 That's what they did
 90  
 91 He was on the basebell team, he was in the marching band
 92 When he was 10 years old he had a watermelon stand
 93  
 94 He was a clean-cut kid
 95 But they made a killer out of him.
 96 That's what they did
 97  
 98 They said, "Listen boy, you're just a pup."
 99 They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up
100  
101 They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills.
102 A jeep to drive, blood to spill
103  
104 They said, "Congratulations you got what it takes."
105 They sent him back into the rat-race without any brakes
106  
107 He was a clean-cut kid
108 But they made a killer out of him
109 That's what they did
110  
111 He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
112 The only game he could play was Russan Roulette
113  
114 He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread,
115 Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed
116  
117 He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole
118 He stole a Rolls Royce and drove it in a swimming pool
119  
120 They took a clean-cut kid
121 And they made a killer out of him
122 That's what they did
123  
124 He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
125 Could've been accountant or a tennis star
126  
127 He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
128 Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay
129  
130 His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
131 They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own
132  
133 They took a clean-cut kid
134 And they made a killer out of him.
135 That's what they did
136  
137 Well, everbody's asking why he couldn't adjust
138 All he ever wanted was somebody to trust
139  
140 They took his head and turned it inside out
141 He never did know what it was all about
142  
143 He had a steady job, he joined the choir
144 He never did plan to walk the high wire
145  
146 They took a clean-cut kid
147 And they made a killer out of him.
148 That's what they did.

155 Its been awhile since I logged in.  Hmm, heres a short poem/song I've written.
156  
157 Carl lived up on the hill
158 he could see the valley below
159 watched it change, the forrests go
160 the rivers turned to stone.
161  
162 He'd made his living getting by
163 He'd never had someone
164 To tell him what to do you see
165 that wouldn't have been right
166  
167 But as his world grew near its end
168 he saw his world colapse
169 and so he went to live inside
170 his world view had been snapped
171  
172 They buried him in a cardboard box
173 no name upon his grave
174 and if you look were he used to live
175 well, you'll find a condo there.
176  
177 (Thats it.  The second part of the third verse sort of bothers me, but I guess
178 it works.  The first verse is probably my favorite right now.  If I could
179 right entire songs like that, I could probably make a living at music.)

208              The Blue Capsule
209                   I'll admit it, I wasn't the best kid when I was growing
210              up.  My parents suspected the worst from me and my friends
211              most of the time.  The were afraid that I would start
212              shooting marijuana and murder them in the night in a drug
213              induced rage.  It's funny how people can distort reality
214              without doing drugs.
215                   John and I were little brats in our early teens and the
216              late summer boredom was hitting us pretty hard one Sunday.
217              We were laying around on my parents bed watching the t.v.,
218              when in walked my father who said he had a job for us to do.
219              Grumbling, the way teenagers do when parents use the "j"
220              word, we confronted the task that was put to us.  It seems
221              that the toilet in my parents bathroom was leaking and the
222              valve was turning on and off two or three times every hour.
223              My dad gave us a new ballcock and flapper ball to replace
224              the old worn parts.
225                   For those of you that have not repaired a toilet this
226              is not a difficult job.  But, for two teenagers it was a
227              monumental task.  After laying all the parts out on the bed
228              we finally figured it out and finished the job with no
229              problems.
230                   It was about an hour or two later that my older sister
231              came running out of the bedroom ranting and raving to my
232              parents that she had found a blue capsule on the bed were
233              John and I had been laying.  By this time my mother was
234              hysterical and my father well, he was not in the best mood I
235              had ever seen him in.  John and I were summoned to the
236              family tribunal gathered in our living room.
237                    "Where did this come from?" my father asked holding
238              the capsule between his thumb and index finger.  John looked
239              at me, and I at him.  "I don't Know" we both said in unison.
240              For a teenager, it is hard not to look guilty even when your
241              not.  "I am going to ask you again, where did this come
242              from?"  "It's not mine" John said with a frightened look.
243              My father looked at me, I quickly denied any knowledge of
244              the capsule.  We weren't pleading our case very well as it
245              was a case of guilt by proximity and the judge and jury had
246              already decided the verdict.
247                   In the meantime,  my sister, the worldly woman she
248              was,(she had moved out of the house for all of a couple of
249              months) had taken the capsule and pulled it apart to inspect
250              the bright blue powder inside.  You know how on T.V. crime-
251              drama shows, when the cops bust a drug ring, they take out
252              their pocket knife poke a little hole in one of the bags of
253              suspected drugs then with their little finger they take a
254              taste.  This is what my sister did (As if she would even
255              know what drugs would taste like; it could have been cow
256              shit for all she knew!).  It immediately made her tongue
257              bright blue.
258                   As the questioning became more heated, John offered
259              that the "pill" was a dental capsule that he had to use to
260              show the plaque on his teeth.  This excuse was verified over
261              the phone with John's mother, but was quickly dispelled when
017=Usr:576 Robert Doherty    11/20/91 22:12  Msg:6816 Call:38514 Lines:30
262              she said that the dental aid in question was not a capsule
263              but in fact a chewable tablet.  Now we were in more trouble
264              as John was now accused of lying.  By this time John's
265              parents were on the way over to the house to inspect the
266              blue capsule for themselves.
267                   John had made a mistake, it was now believed that the
268              pill was his, since he had lied.  I was still not off the
269              hook though, for instead of proximity it was association
270              that made me guilty.  Soon his parents would show up and the
271              full court would convene.  I had truly no idea where the
272              pill had come from and was beginning to think that it was
273              John's.
274                    With the arrival of John's parents, the facts and
275              evidence were brought out and an inspection of the bed only
276              revealed the empty package and instructions of the toilet
277              hardware.  My father suddenly started to laugh, he was
278              reading the instructions.  Everyone was looking at him,
279              John's parents especially, since they did not see anything
280              funny about this at all.  He began to read out loud "step
281              sixteen: to make sure the flapper ball is installed properly
282              take blue capsule and sprinkle in toilet tank, if blue dye
283              appears in toilet bowl reseat flapper ball."
284                   We were all howling, all except my sister whose tongue
285              stayed blue for two days.  John and I lived like kings for
286              the next few days.  And I will always remember the story of
287              the blue capsule.

334 Heres a verse I wrote.
335  
336     Carl lived up on the hill
337     He could see the valley below
338     Watched it change
339     The forests go
340     The rivers turned to stone
341  
342 The last line is really about southern california.  As far as I know, there 
343 are just about no natural rivers or creeks anywhere near the cities.  They
344 are all contained by big cement sewers, just like the ones you see
345 in terminator II and other movies.
346  
347 I remember playing in them as a kid.  One day I even talked some friends into
348 crawling down one of the side pipes.  I was about 12 at the time.  It was 
349 something of an adventure.  We took water, and flashlights, and away we went.
350  
351 We got about a querter mile in, before we gave up.  We'de ran into

451 for them to deal with.  After submitting a 200-pg defense I received a 6-liner

453 TRYING to point out to THEM) with which they no longer wanted to deal, but
454 they They'd also lost the material I'd submitted.  (Before he'd said he 
455 thought it was "lying" around the Board/PUBLIC INFORMATION office somewhere
456 ... is there no end to this kind of respect/regard???)  When I'd called

493 Besides Neil, another thing I don't like about Vera is Arlene.  Not jut be-
494 cause She MADE Them name a major DT landmark after Her, but I think I once
495 interviewed for a "secretarial" job at one of Her corporations when I was
496 much younger and stupider (yes, it IS possible).  The Office was a profuse
497 plantation-type brick estate down the street from MLC and this matronly-
498 looking interrogater harshly grilled me on whether I thought I was able to
499 "keep secrets" and it I'd be willing to "travel." <-???  I'd already de-
500 plored the manor milieu, but Her manner also gave me the creeps.  May it
501 somehow reminded me of the unforgettable week I'd spent as a "live-in" at
502 the Helzer Estate.
503  
504 I was like a sophomore or junior in high school and my mom'd begun her
505 usual fet about my summer "supervision" while she was at work.  Besides I
506 think she was of the opnion we always at odds only because I was a 
507 "spoiled brat" and need to experience the Real World of Work so I might
508 would "appreciate" home a little more.  And since when she was growing up
509 she'd worked summers as a live-in (mainly to escape the Christian tyrrany
510 of a cruel older sister), she thought THAT would be a wonderful alternative
511 to my usual attendance at summer school.  So I went to the employment 
512 division and they found me this summer live-in "babysitting" assignment 
513 offering "room and board" and a whopping 50 smackers a month!
514  
515 The Helzer estate was an entire block in Alameda and they had one Kid I
516 hardly ever saw.  They also had a "Cook" and we both lived in slave cells
517 over the garage.  The Cook was an older woman and I seem to recall she had 
518 a heavy accent and something wrong with her foot. It was all wrapped up in
519 bandages which made her limp.  Evidently, the Cook had the sae loose range
520 of on-call "duties" I did because I remember Mrs. Helzer calling Down on
521 her intercom one morning (I think we were doing the breakfast dishes) 
522 ordering her to the basement to Fetch the Kid's socks, which she was to
523 deliver to His Upstairs bedroom.  I offered to do it for her because of
524 her age and foot and all those stairs and all, but she declined.  I think
525 her reason was I wouldn't be able to find them or some such thing, which 
526 led me to think she knw because she probably musta DID their stupid laundry
527 too.
528  
529 As it ended up, the only tme I "Babysat" was for maybe two hours on the
530 second or third day when She dropped me and the kid off at Grant for an
531 athletic program he was attending.  I was ordered to sit outside on the
532 grass and retrive him after class.  I think that was the same day she 
533 mentioned something about wanting me to wear a Uniform for the duration
534 of my endentureship.
535  
536 The rest of my time there I was a stupid, "cheap" teenage domestic, work-
537 ing for a fraction of what they would've had to pay for the Real Thing,
538 plus they probably thought I was just young and dumb enough to feel I
539 should Do anything they asked.  As it turned out, after helping the cook 
540 ad "serving" the Family their meals (for which, I was told, I'd need
541 LESSONS), my main duty was not only the upkeep of Mr. Helzer's somewhat
542 isolated living quarters (including steriklizing his bathroom/walk-in
543 8-head shower room [<-we'd better get the PGE police over there] AND a
544 daily change of sheets) but I was soon informed I'd be buzzed in my
545 cell in the evening to take a glass of prune joice of his nightstand 
546 each night.  I think this was the same day I was also ordered to make 
547 sure their 30-piece silver service display was kept polished.  I'm pretty
548 sure I did take the juice up but maybe I just freaked out at the thought,
549 but I called my MUCH OLDER sister <-grin (and second mother) and she had
550 me outta there in a FLASH.  She toldl 'em off real good too.
551  
552 I ended up living with my sister and her girlfriend the rest of te
553 summer and they got me a Decent job "serving meals" to Decent folk at
554 the neighborhood restaurant they both worked at weekends.  I didn't
555 have to wear a uniform and earned triple the money too!

718 I sure hope the case against Al Brown is more substantial than he one Tigard's
719 Finest had against me and my friend. It was one of the few times I'd coerced
720 a whole day's yardwork outta my roommate, and since we'd toiled from dawn
721 until dusk that fine spring day, we were too tired and hungry by nightfall 
722 to even THINK about fixing dinner.  So we'd decided to use the mailed coupon
723 for Godfather's Pizza that'd jut opened right down the street.  As it hap-
724 pened, we were the only customers there until a carlod of obnoxiously drunk
725 bowlers made their presence known and scared me halfto death with their
726 menacing-sounding rowdiness toward the order taker.  I finished quickly and
727 left, noting Tigard's finfest parked in the lot next dorr -- I'd thought
728 there were ethere because they'd been following the drunks or that the lone
729 pizza worker had been scared of 'em too and had called for assistance.  But
730 NooOOoOO, for some reason we soon notice they wee following **US** ... 
731 clear up past Fred Meyer, where they finally turned on their light and 
732 motioned for us to pull into the isolated parking lot just past Burger King
733 on Barbur ... way up and off the road.  No sooner had they pulled out their
734 2' mettal flashlight/bill clubs to shine steadily in our eyes than we 
735 noticed, 3, 4, 5 other Tigard patrolcars pulling in (evidently it was a SLOW
736 night or something).  Unfortunately I asked something that mighta sounded a
737 little smartassed about why they were shining their clubs in my eyes and 
738 they immediately had my friend's door open and ordered him outta the car.
739 THey took him over and bent him over their patrol car to search him, hand-
740 cuffed his hands way up behind his back then told him to "get up (off the
741 patrol car) LIKE A MAN", after which they threw him to the ground to remove
742 his shoes.  
743  
744 By THAT time, my dog (a MEAN samoyed-poodle who'd come along foro the ride)
745 and I were practically hysterical.  She was running around barking at the
746 circle of "reserves" that'd surrounded us and I was complaining (possibly
747 rather loudly) that the whole thing seemed like a ridiculous third-rate
748 60s anti-eveything movie coe true, which WOULD be funny if it wasn't.  As
749 it ended up my friend was dragged off to Hillsboro, charged with "resist-
750 ing arrest" <-???, this stemming from an original charge of "running the
751 red" back at Godfathers (it IS/WAS confusing down there ... by the Tigard
752 drivein ... that weird loop that is landscaped/fenced).  And they also
753 threatened me I was "that far" away (thumb/forefinger almost touching) from
754 being arrested myself.
755  
756 Since I didn't drive and was told I'd have to remove the car from the mid-
757 dle of the parking lot, I went to the restaurant across the street to call
758 my neighbor to ask him to come drive the car home.  When I returned to the
759 "scene of the crime" I found they'd all simply abandoned me ... leaving me
760 alone in that dark, sisolated parking lot at 11:00 PM or so just a few days
761 after the first woman was found murdered out here.  I filed a complaint
762 about the whole thing with the police department and I DID hear from them
763 some months later.  Another 6-liner (only because of the 2" margins) stating
764 the City had looked into the matter and there was no wrongdoing on their
765 part.  Period.  So my friend remains to be tagged a vicious "criminal" for
766 life.
767  
768 And Meantime, all this while we've been sitting ducks out here for all the
769 REAL criminals they've never seemed to do anything about ... including the 
770 vicious and possibly even MORE TREACHEROUS criminal pursuits of the "white
771 collar" types.

774 Ah, the joys of recording music.  Recorded the song _on the run_ yesterday
775 on my little 4 track.  (I've posted lyrics and chords for this one here 
776 before.)  My brother wrote a bass part for it that sounds fairly good,
777 and a friend of mine wrote a guitar part that fits in really well.  All 
778 in all it sounds good.  
779  
780 The downside was me recording the vocal about 15 times.  I just couldn't seem
781 to please myself.  In the end I just decided to live with something less
782 then perfection.

801  
802 I guess I really SHOULD start asking other people what THEY know and think
803 about the Al Brown allegations, because in my heart I never believed the
804 first convictions.  There's a whole bunch of weird people out here that all
805 hung out down at the General Store and the Wright guy they arrested this
806 month lived right near there too.  Then there's the ones who DIDN'T hang
807 out down there who are equally as weird who might have their OWN reasons
808 for wanting Brown to take the rap instead of the REAL perpetrator(s).  I
809 think a history of this whole area is in order.
810  
811 I will say that the senior Al Brown was an exemplary citizen in this area.
812 For years he'd till my neighbors' and "my" backlots for less than it probably
813 cost him to drive his tractor up the street and he's help the other widows
814 in the neighborhood with odd jobs they were unable to do too.  He always
815 kept his house and yard neat as  apin and always had his two back lots in
816 vegetables.  The same cannot be said for the house diagonally across from
817 him whose family had a neighborhood "history."  One of the older women who
818 got a call had Mr. Brown as a pallbearer at her husband's funeral too.  Mr.
819 Browon got cancer shortly after the first convictions and has since died.  
820 That house and the house across the street from it stood empty for I don't
821 know how long.  The weird place across from them was just tilled under last
822 summer and the who empty houses finally sold.  When I told a neighbor that
823 has moved outta the neighborhood, she said I'd better check on down the
824 street because the it appears the offender simply moved down the street.
825 When she described the house, I knew it right away because I'd noticed it
826 looked "deathly" years ago.  
827  
828 One of the things I resent about the whole thing is the all the hype sur-
829 rounding it.  It seems like the case is already built against him before
830 there's even been a trial.  And I think part of the problem is that the
831 neighborhod ... no the entire sw area ... has been preprimed through those
832 questionable neighborhood associations who seem to be the only outlet for
833 area crime information anymore (which makes me begin to wonder about these
834 new c
835 "community policing" policies too).  There's ALWAYS been weird corruption
836 out here and I've always felt it was more of a "cause and effect" situation.
837 I always kinda think when you've got alot of "legal"-type corruption thru
838 city bureaus and government officials, you're gonna have a backlash or what
839 is is commonly called "criminal" activity even though they're both the same.
840 Too bad we can't just call a truce, huh?  But there's money to be made ...

857  
858               I'm walking along the beach near Negril, seven miles of
859          white sand spread out in a crescent before me as I squint
860          into the morning sun. Not another soul on the beach as far as
861          I can see, not another sound in the air other than the {entle
862          lapping of the turquoise waves on the white shore and the
863          stray calls of brightly colored birds in the lush rustling
864          vegetation.
865               I come upon a set of railroad tracks that rise up out of
866          the water, sever the small beach and disappear into the
867          brush. No way. Could a storm have washed them up? Nobody
868          builds railroad tracks into the sea. I touch a steel rail
869          with my bare foot. It's hot from the sun. And it's vibrating.
870               I leap back as the sea suddenly explodes. Out of boiling
871          white foam a black steel smokestack emerges like Godzilla,
872          billowing a great plume of grey smoke into the morning air. A
873          giant steam locomotive engine, just like in the Westerns,
874          rises out of the frothy Caribbean and roars past me as I
875          stand dumbstruck in the sand--pistons furiously pumping,
876          giant iron wheels spinning over the tracks, seawater
877          evaporating off the hot churning black machinery. Car after
878          car thundering past me, old wooden passenger cars, windows
879          sparkling wet in the tropical sunshine. I can see inside.
880          There are people in there Ladies in bonnets, gentlemen in
881          top hats smoking big cigars. I'm rooted to the spot where I
882          stand, frozen in raw shock and awe. As the caboose disappears
883          into the jungle and the man standing on the platform waves to
884          me, I wave back. A reflex.
885               Finally, I pull my feet back out of the sand where
886          they've sunk. I touch the rail again with my foot. No
887          vibration. I follow the tracks into the green foliage. After
888          about fifty yards, the wooden ties begin to sink
889          progressively deeper into the ground, until the steel rails
890          themselves disappear into the sandy undergrowth.

900 MICHAEL Brown, huh?  Bet he's that too good to be true/Blonde Troy Donohue
901 type who tilled our bac lots that one year ...
902  
903 I'm still wondering who it was, though, that I wated for the bus with one 
904 day about 6-8 yrs before this whole mess started who insisted on giving me
905 a ride to town instead of my hitchhiking when it appeared the bus wasn't
906 coming.  Had his car parked right across the street, too.  Now the story
907 on this car, he'd said, was that he'd gotten it from the guy who used to
908 own "the gas station" right there on Barbur (there were 3 if you counted
909 the old one that WAS the bus stop).  I think he said he'd gotten it instead
910 of backwages when the station was sold.  Said the car'd belonged to the
911 guy's son, who'd worked there too, along with alot of other neighborhood
912 boys.  Said the passenger seat HAD been wired and door handles removed on
913 the passenger side. He cautioned me NEVER to hitchhike, but if I DID never
914 to get in a car with the doorhandles removed.  (After I'd gotten a ride
915 from an old man handing out those weird religious tracts that looked like
916 they were produced by perverts, I DID quit BTW).
917  
918 Now I never DID know who this guy was ... or his son, but when I told this
919 story to a neighbor whose brother attended school with this son, she said
920 "oh yeaer" in a way you knew was weird.  I don't think too much about it
921 UNTIL one day when we were driving down the freeway in rush hour traffic
922 right next to this guy who was towing this pickup with a woman (probably
923 his sister) in the truck steering.  Evidently the truck had no brakes and
924 they weren't using a towbar, only a rope. Somehow the pickup rammed into
925 the towed truck sending the tow car into the guardrail, breaking the rope
926 and setting the truck free  ... without brakes.  The chick ended up bailing
927 out of the moving truck onto the road divered between the freeway and Bar-
928 bur and her truck continued through the red light and down Barbur into a
929 gas station jut past what was then Denny's Restaurant.  As it turned out,
930 the car closest to the "accident"
931 ended up as a witness down at the gas station and I heard him say he was
932 the son of the guy who'd owned the station up te street.  He seemed almost
933 silly or giddy or maybe "ON something" (as Tigard's Finest are fond to say).
934 If I remember correctly, I think he had a bald spot with stringy long hair.
935 And when I've thought about it lately, in my own mind, HE seeme more the 
936 type to be continually harrassing people in the neighborhood by such pranks
937 as turning all the outdoor water spigots in the yard in the middle of the 
938 night.

940 Unrelated but also interesting too, last summer while I was out sunbathing
941 I heard some strange noises, like branches breaking.  Since we'd had a rash
942 of this type of vandalism for the past couple of years, I went to investi-
943 gate and found this "hippy"-looking lady with long bkack frizzy hair and 
944 her teenage son standing in the yard of the empty house that was "secretly"
945 up for sale (the house across for THAT was empty too and up for sale).  I
946 explained my Mission and ended up talking to her for half an hour or so 
947 (the neighborhood Overlord was overseeing the operation too).  Anyway she
948 said she was the wife of the ex-chief of police from Sherwood ... that 
949 they'd lived in California for ahile (San Diego or Sacramento, can't remem-
950 ber), but had returned some time ago and had rented the Brown's house up
951 the street, so was Familiar with the neighorhood.  Shortly after that,
952 the weird house across the street from the Browns mysteriously "disappeared"
953 (amost overnight) and the 10-year collection of old metal, refrigerators,
954 cars and whatever was removed from the yard too.  Seems to me 10 years ago 
955 there was only a gargantuan old boat sitting around in that yard.  They'd
956 also had fire there some time back .... maybe like the one this last fall.
957  
958 VVVVVVVVV Perhaps they should question some of the OLDER neighbors that
959 USED to live up there ... the ones in the same business maybe.
