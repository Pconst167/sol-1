This is the last BWII archive disk.

Notes: Due to the on-going failures of the system, the date and time stamp was 
repeatedly out of sync. This disk was installed on 6 Dec 1994. At Line 249, 
the clock did not change over to the new year, so the date started over with
1994 again instead of 1995. The date was fixed on line 320. Unfortunately on
line 520 it failed again to update the clock for 1996 leaving the date as
being still 1995. The date was finally fixed again on line 542. 
1997 starts on line 713 and once again the date is incorrect on the time 
stamp. This time I didn't fix it as the problems with the system were making 
everything fragile and I was afraid to touch anything as it was taking many 
hours to get it running again when I tried to do anything. 
On 19 July 1997 the system failed once again. Since I was in the process of 
moving to my new house, I just turned the system off and that was the 
glorious end of BWII. After ten years of continuous operation, the Sanyo 555 
well deserved its retirement. May it rest in peace.

 27 patter of sleet against her cloak masked the sound of the icy creek below. 
 28 She swept back her hood and looked up at her companion.  He stood gaunt with
 29 deep-set black eyes and graying hair tied back in a pony tail.  His ears
 30 jutted like wind sails.
 31      "It's not the same is it, Doctor?" She said.
 32      "No, not the same," Frankenstupe said not looking at her.  "It hasn't
 33 been the same for a long time.  No one's been able to explain it."
 34      "Has everyone left the Inn?"
 35      "Most have.  A few lurk in the twilight waiting for the return of the
 36 glory days."  Frankenstupe sighed.  "I fear they wait for naught."
 37      "Maybe we can do something," Mary said.  "There must be a solution, a
 38 way to bring the old ones back.  All we have to do is solve the mystery of
 39 their leaving."  She felt warmed by the possibilities.
 40      "My very own Nancy Drew."  Frankenstupe's smile was more of a grimace.
 41 "Come, I need to see the Rowan.  Maybe that will give us a clue."

 48      "It's dying," I say.  "The Rowan is dying."  The bleakness overwhelms
 49 me.
 50      "Can't anything be done?"  Her hand grips my arm.  "Surely, we can do
 51 something."  I hear the pleading in her voice and look down at her.  She 
 52 is the light to my dark, short and stout with long red braids coiled on
 53 either side of her head.  We are not lovers, may never be, yet I love her.
 54      "Perhaps," I say.  "We must find the cause of the infection and

106 ========================================================================
107 Well, hello!  You're the closest to an admitted atheist I guess I'll get.
108 Shall I call you Thesis or Anti?  :]  Anyway, you've presented a very 
109 good dilemma:  the existence of a loving God vs. the reality of suffering.
110 But the doctrine of hellfire and 'once saved, always saved' are not based
111 on scriptures.  I'll take issue with those later if you like.
112 
113 Do I understand you correctly that you believe God's existence isn't sure?
114 Kind of a neutral stand?  
115 
116 "Some, however, feel that it is illogical to believe in God, since we
117 cannot see him.  But what about air, sound waves, and odors?  We cannot
118 see any of these things, yet we know they exist.  Our lungs, ears, and noses
119 tell us so.  Surely, we believe in what cannot be seen if we have evidence.
120 
121 After contemplating the physical evidence--including electrons, protons,
122 atoms, amino acids, and the complex brain--natural scientist Irving William
123 Knobloch was moved to say:  "I believe in God because to me His Divine 
124 existence is the only logical explanation for things as they are."
125 Similarly, physiologist Marlin Books Kreider states: "Both as an ordinary
126 human being, and also as a man devoting his life to scientific study and
127 research, I have no doubt at all about the existence of God."
128 
129 These men are not alone.  According to physics professor Henry Margenau,
130 "if you take the top-notch scientists, you find very few atheists among them."
131 Neither the advances of science nor the failure of religion need force us
132 to abandon belief in a Creator."  w94 12/1 pp6,7
133 
134 A scientific mind likes to get into the details of their field of interest,
135 marveling over the intricate *design* and order found in astronomy, biology,
136 mathematics, chemistry--you name it!  Psalms 104:24,25 gives credit 
137 where its due, to the wisdom of the Almighty Jehovah:
138 "How many your works are, O Jehovah!
139    All of them in wisdom you have made.
140    The earth is full of your productions.
141 As for this sea so great and wide,
142    There there are moving things without number,
143    Living creatures, small as well as great."
013=Usr:167 HUGH FARRELL      12/19/94 22:23  Msg:8235 Call:47902 Lines:15
144 
145 Speaking of giving credit where its due, I've been tardy answering you,
146 Network Zero, about the source of this article.  Its the Watchtower of
147 December 1, 1994, published by the Watchtower, Bible & Tract Society.
148 I've typed in the bulk of a series of articles under the heading of
149 "Uncovering the Roots of Atheism."  Naturally, you know that Jehovah's
150 Witnesses distribute these magazines, and I'm not shy to say that I am one.
151 I beg your pardon for not saying so earlier, because these names seem to
152 spook people!  Judge for yourself the quality of its writing, and the
153 weight of its arguments.  (I subscribe to the Watchtower and the Awake!
154 myself, and have often wondered if you knew that theres a section in the
155 latter called "Watching the World."  Does your pseudonym connect here??)

169    Greets and happy holidays to you, AD.  Good to hear from you...
170  
171    Denise - It is not so much a neutral stance that I take, but rather
172 the odd feeling that if there is "God" (quotations used in the
173 Christian concept) it strikes me odd that such a powerful and
174 knowing existence would have such human emotions.  If there is a higher
175 being that coordinates the Universe, it is not as we know it
176 through any of our religions here on Earth.

194 As I write this, the heroically swirling "Go, Team Banzai" theme is playing on 
195 my radio, and as it ends a quote interrupts between songs.  
196 
197 "I found a way where we never have to buy gasoline any more.  You find some
198  people, but they have to be hanged - and then you chop off their hands and-...
199  you, you throw them in the fire and they burn forever."
200                                                          - *Parents*
201 
202 I solved M Y S T two days ago.  It was a satisfying experience to play the game
203 even if the ending was not satisfying.  However, I suspect that may have been 
204 the point - since the "final chapter has yet to be written" and, from the 
205 quality of this game, I hope it never will.  
206 
207 Now the song is "The Island" from the 1989-1990 remake of *Lord of the Flies*.
208 It's a very good song, very quiet and melancholy, with strings and choir.  
209 
210 I notice the curious stirrings of a story beginning to pull itself together on
211 the Backwater, a sort of half-baked skeleton erecting itself in the middle of a
212 crowded portion of a formerly-deserted park - three or four people standing in 
213 the middle of infinite blackness.  Everywhere they touch, they make a leaf or a
214 branch on a tree, or an etching of woodboard.  It's an interesting experience
215 to watch, but I am hoping that they do not resurrect the Inn, be it dead or 
216 hiding.  That place is gone from here, perhaps to return or not.  However, I
217 believe it would be the Cistop's responsibility to return it to this plane, as
218 I believe he was the one who took it away in the first place if I'm not totally
219 mistaken.  If I am, I apologize.  
220 
221 Still, I'd welcome a story.  Zephyr has been frozen in time, running away from
222 that candy-apple red robot (also frozen in time) for far too long, and I'd like
223 to have him resurface.  He has a long, long story to tell (who doesn't?) and I
224 would love to get part of it out before I must return to college (good luck, I 
225 go in a couple of days) to help the process of rebuilding a fictional context 
226 on the Backwater.  That would be a true pleasure, indeed - as this is the last
227 of the Scrolling Storyboards, if I do not miss my guess.
228 
229 The heroic swirlings of the "Battlestar Galactica" theme are telling me that I
230 must begin my own lonely quest for the shining planet known as Earth, and I am 
231 answering the call.  If I do not return here before my sojourn, rest assured I
232 will be back on weekends.  :)
233 
234 Good luck to all, and the best of wishes to be granted.

333 still, I remember her.  Godddess, this hurts!  I now know I should have done
334 drugs when I was a teen, maybe then I would not have these psychodic.psy-
335 shedelic visions.  But I see hem and I know her name (in this life and in that)
336 Father, help me!  Please! 
337 The realm of New Soho calls, and, sadly, I answer,  I am saying more than
338 I would sober, but it is the truth that I  would say to my most innner
339 circlem but not to those who would read this.
340 I am with a woman, now.
341 I love another.
342 my destiny lay with still a third, whom, i doubt, will be mine in this life.
343 
344 My lady's cat doth fraeak out, now
345 
346 Why do I do this to myself?  Indeed, on  the eve of an accounting  test?
347 With luck, I will hve sobered myself up enoughg to pass the test, howwever
348 I have told you all who care to read more than I fear the Horned One
349 would approve.  Further, I fight myself to keep from saying more.
350 
351 I started this message becau se I fear I have an alcohol problem.
352 I am totaly screwed-up.  I think I am about to puke,  Still, I cannot
353 stop drinking.  Nor can I see in leSS THAN 5 dimensions.  41
354 It is said that denial is the first sign.  I deny nothing.  What is the secind

362 PHOENIX:  Re - Your Alcohol Problem...  Denial is the first stage in dealing
363 with death.  Are you ready to die?  If not, then I strongly suggest you go to
364 the nearest chairopractic specialist to acquire a backbone and quit this thing
365 you call an 'alcohol problem'.  
366 
367 You can spend time, effort and money on AA meetings and group-hugs, but the
368 ultimate decision comes down to whether or not you want to dive into the race
369 with the best of them or dive face-first into a giant mud-pie of your own 
370 making.  This is not stated to be cruel - this is merely a statement of my own
371 perceived fact on the matter at hand.
372 
373 Only you can decide to quit.  If you don't decide to quit and you think it's a 
374 genuine problem for yourself, you're not living up to your own expectations and
375 as such are undeserving of sympathy or pity.
376 
377 In short, solve your problem or quit whining.  Alcoholism is like any addiction
378 in that it can be cured through sheer willpower if you've got the "moxy" for it
379 in your blood.  Now we need to ask ourselves if you do or not.

434 Just to let you all know, the system crashed. I'm just now trying
435 to get it back in shape. Apparently there were some on going problems. 
436 It has been several years since I had done any maintance on the beast,
437 so things kind of deteriorated. I think that things are back to
438 about as normal as BW gets. At least for now.

441 P.S. I don't think that anything was lost, although if you entered anything 
442 in the last day or so, it may have been lost. Also the disk to the extended
443 rooms was damaged and I had to revert to an old backup. If you entered
444 anything there within the last year, it will have been lost. The last time
445 I checked nobody had entered anything, so the actual loss is probably 
446 within the last couple of months since I last checked on things. 
447 Of course the real reason for the crash may have been because Milchar
448 appeared in a puff of smoke recently and entered the Inn through the 
449 Innkeeper's private entrance. Who knows what things he did! <grin>

453 handle.  I think the last time was back in early 89'.  I have been without a
454 decent modem or computer for the past few years.  With all the Internet access
455 and power that services like Compuserve abd AOL have gained, and with the
456 increasing power of terminal software, I wasn't sure if BWMS was still around.
457 I was pleasently surprised to see after 6 years, it is still around.  I still
458 see some familer names, like Astral Dreamer, Kurfur, and others.  Nice to see
459 some of the good old boards are still around.  What ever happened to Lisa
460 Gronke?  Applephillia?  When last I was on the modem, most boards were IBM

572 The large man in the brown robe sat silently at his table, earnestly examining
573 a map.  It was drawn on parchment, and showed traces of blood from a distant
574 past.
575 
576 The man reached, without looking, for a tankard of ale, and knocked it off the
577 edge of the table.
578 
579 "Damn.  Now I'll need to fetch a mop."
580 
581 "No need" said the pleasantly rounded barmaid, "Just toss a panful of chips on 
582 it there."  And she pointed to the scoop of chips in a bin just behind the
583 table where the man now half stood.
584 
585 She was not a young woman, nor yet middle aged.  She was a bit rounded, but 
586 not so much to be considered obese.  The type that was a great asset in the
587 bedroom, and a wonderful barmaid.  She had long brown hair, always done up in
588 a golden clasp on the back of her head.  She wore a standard peasant blouse, 
589 that did enough to conceal her breasts that a man could still wonder just
590 how they might feel to the touch.
591 
592 "Sorry for the clumsiness," the man said, as he scooped out some chips to 
593 soak up the wayward ale, "I guess I'll be buying another now."
594 
595 "Don't worry about it, Friar, I've grown used to it from the folk here.  I
596 guess it's better to have a spill now and again than have no customers about
597 at all."  And she laughed, a light laughter that seemed to flit up to the 
598 rafters and then come around behind you and tickle the back of your neck.
599 
600 "Och, Lassie, you're a dear." Friar replied, in a fake brogue. "I'd marry you
601 on the morrow, if ye hadna thrown me out o yer bed."
602 
603 She laughed again and handed him a new tankard of ale.  "One of these days, 
604 I'll ask you back again, but a girl needs some time to recover from such 
605 an adventure."
606 
607 It was a standing joke, for although they loved each other dearly, it was on 
608 a different plane than the physical.  Their love was the love of shared 
609 pasts, shared adventures, and true comfort.  They could see each other naked
610 without the encumbrance of desire, and they could share a bed with others
611 without the ugliness of jealousy consuming them.
612 
613 "What are you studying so intently?" she asked, sliding in next to him on the
614 bench, her own ale in hand.
615 
616 "A map that came by courier from Jerusalem.  Just the map, and a single word
617 message."
618 
619 She raised her eyebrows quizically, waiting.
620 
621 After a few seconds, she smacked him on the back of the head lightly, "Out 
622 with it, you scoundrel, what was the word?"
623 
624 "Adventure."

631 She looked at him with a smile just beginning to quicken her mouth.  
632 "Adventure?  And are we all going?"
633 
634 "All of us?  I don't even know if I am going.  Look here."  He pointed at the
635 blood stains.  "I would venture to guess that these stains did not arrive out
636 of caprice or accident.  Adventure usually means danger.  And I'm not a young
637 man any more."
638 
639 She took a large drink out of her tankard, and sat there silently, waiting for
640 Friar Mossback to continue.  She knew he would if she waited just a bit.
641 
642 "Damnation.  You know we don't have a snowball's chance in hell of getting a
643 good troupe to go with us these days.  No one even comes around here any more
644 to ask, they're all off doing other things, with other lives now."
645 
646 She looked at him with the warmth of years of friendship. "Then we'll go by
647 ourselves, and pick up a new band of hardy friends along the way."
648 
649 He put his hand on her thigh and gave a squeeze, "And maybe a lover or two?"
650 
651 She smacked his hand away, "I thought you weren't a young man any more?"
652 
653 "I'm not dead.  And I'm not the one who has to young," he laughed, and then
654 turned back to the parchment map.  "Look here," he pointed to some obscure
655 symbols on the edge of the map, faded with age.  "Rose, cross, and sword."
656 
657 "The order of Red Knights?"
658 
659 "Hmm, I think so.  This could indeed be fun.  And dangerous."
660 
661 The last time the Red Knights had been encountered, Friar had almost been
662 killed, but he had also obtained one of his most favored possesions, the 
663 magic sporran that always held sustenance for him and his companions.  
664 There was always a ham and swiss on rye in brown paper in there, and always
665 a flask of water.  And no matter how many were pulled out, another would 
666 take its place in two or three minutes.  He pulled one out now, and handed 
667 it to the barmaid, who opened the paper and looked inside the sandwich.
668 
669 "It's ALWAYS ham and cheese on rye," the friar said.
670 
671 "I know, but once in a while, I could hope for tuna salad."

679 The sun was setting outside the window of the skyscraper Machmud worked in. 
680 He looked up from his desk, and remembered to marvel at the colors as the 
681 faded through golds and reds in the dust storms that always seemd to grow in
682 the desert at this time of night.  His first task had been completed.  He had
683 sent the message to the Friar.  
684 He looked again in the box sent by post this morning.  It contained the hands,
685 feet and toungue of the messenger who had been sent to meet with Friar.  He 
686 was a trusted soul, and one could only hope that his passing out of this plane

688 Hagit, his opponent in this little drama, was not a type to let the messenger
689 die quietly and quickly.  She would have known that the messenger would never
690 divulge who now had the map, but she would torture him just the same.  He was
691 surprised that there had been no recording of the screams of pain as teh last
692 breath escaped the dying man.  Most likely it was because he only praised G-D
693 to the last for doing what he was destined to do.
694 Machmud touched a button on his wristband, and a door silently slid open, 
695 revealing a full bar.  He opened the fridge and pulled out a couple of ice 
696 cubes and a frozen glass.  Reaching for the Chivas, he decided against it, 
697 tossed the ice cubes in the sink and grabbed the Glenfiddich instead.
698 Two hours later, he was still nursing the same scotch, and he was cruising the
699 net intensely, covering his tracks well, and coming up empty handed.

703 Time, it passes all to quickly. I just checked the log....I have not taken
704 a draft at the Inn since early 90'. It is good to hear the voices from the

713 ###################### 6 Jan 1997 ###############################
714 A lone figure approached the run-down building. Carefully crossing
715 an old bridge, he approached the Inn. Yes, it was the Backwater Inn.
716 But the stranger was no stranger. He knew the Inn better than 
717 anyone else. He was the Innkeeper. 
718 
719 It had been a long time since the Innkeeper had been at the old Inn, 
720 and it was looking the worse for the wear. It was falling apart. 
721 The brass knocker lay on the ground in front of the old oak door, 
722 and inside it was worse. Little remained in servicable condition. 
723 
724 The dust and cobwebs covered much of the Backwater Inn. It was 
725 apparent that there had been previous attempts to clean them away, 
726 but they remained nonetheless. 
727 
728 Walking over to the bar, he picked up an old rag that he had so
729 often used to not just keep the bar clean but to give him something
730 to do and provide a comforting image to the patrons. In his revere, 
731 the Innkeeper made a pass at the bar with the old rag, but the rag 
732 fell apart in his hands. 
733 
734 With a sigh, the Innkeeper turned away and stepping around the 
735 broken trap door went into the room he used to call home. There 
736 was no need to push the curtain aside because it had long ago 
737 fallen to the floor. 
738 
739 The Innkeeper had come in search of something. He dug around under 
740 the old bed disturbing ages of dust. Finally he found what he 
741 was looking for, an old box filled with papers. A small gold 
742 plaque was attached to the top of the box. It said simply, "archives". 
743 
744 Upon close inspection, he noticed that bookworms had been busy 
745 attacking the outer edges and several pages were damaged beyond 
746 repair, but almost the entire stack was in good enough condition
747 to be transcribed. It was enough to make the trip worth the effort.
748 
749 The Innkeeper breathed a small sigh and tucked the box under his 
750 arm. With a last longing look at the room, he traced his way 
751 back out the way he had come. As he passed the trap-door, he 
752 whispered "Goodbye Barney. Maybe we'll meet in another place at 
753 another time." But the Innkeeper was only met with snoring. 
754 
755 At the door, the Innkeeper looked back one last time at the 
756 run down Inn. A few shadows seemed to move at the back of the Inn,
757 but he couldn't tell for sure. For some reason he felt compelled to 
758 say out loud "last one out be sure to put out the fires!" 
759 But of course there were no fires to put out the embers had long 
760 since died out. 
761 
762 On the way out the Innkeeper caught a cobweb with his face. 
763 With a small curse he wiped it a way; "damn the cobwebs!"  
764 'the cobwebs...the webs...the webs...the web...the web...the web...' 
765 
766 For some reason it echoed through the empty Inn leaving a small 
767 chill in the small of the Innkeeper's back. Carefully the Innkeeper 
768 closed the old oak door. Despite the ravages of time, and the 
769 rusty old hinges, it still closed. 
770 
771 Facing the court yard, the Innkeeper spied the old rowan tree 
772 which was near death. A tear came to his eye at seeing the once 
773 majestic tree in such shape. Yet the memories remain. His hand 
774 touched the locket in his vest. Yes, it was still there. 
775 The memories were as strong as ever. In that sense, the Rowan 
776 would live on forever regardless of what nature and time did 
777 to the tree.
778 
779 As the Innkeeper carefully made his way across the rickety old 
780 bridge, his foot slipped and a board broke. He nearly fell into 
781 the small stream, but caught himself before that happened. 
782 The effort however caused a flap on his backpack to pop open, 
783 and several small rectangular cards flew out. They appeared to 
784 be the type that some businessmen used to introduce themselves. 
785 
786 One of the small cards was caught up by a small gust of wind which 
787 skittered it across the ground to land in front of the door to the
788 old Inn. The Innkeeper didn't seem to notice, he continued on his 
789 way. Off to new lands, new adventures. Maybe even a new Inn 
790 someplace else if he ever got tired of wandering. 
791 
792 A small animal hopped up to the Inn's door and sniffed the card. 
793 Dust covered part of the card, but a close up view showed a 
794 portion that was readable. It appeared to say;
795 
796   +---------------------------+
797   |    "www.backwater.com"    |
798   +---------------------------+
799 
800 It was just a random grouping of light and dark areas to the 
801 small furry creature. So he wrinkled his nose and hopped away. 
802 The small furry animal watched as the Innkeeper stepped onto the road
803 and head off into the distance. The Innkeeper paused for a moment
804 and seemed to start to turn his head to look back, but changed his mind
805 and continued off down the road dwindling into the distance. 
806 A single word drifted it's way back towards the old Inn. 
807 If you listened carefully, it would sound like he said 'goodbye...'.

810 *** IMPORTANT NOTICE *** IMPORTANT NOTICE *** IMPORTANT NOTICE ***
811 After June 25th, 1997 BWMS II will be shut down. After 16 years of
812 continuous operation, ten of those years on this trusty old Sanyo 555,
813 BWMS, the oldest continuously operating BBS in the northwest will 
814 close its doors. This comes about for two reasons. One is that I am
815 moving, and the other is that the Sanyo has been slowly dying. Given 
816 the reduction of activity here, it seemed like a good time to call it
817 quits. That does not mean that BWMS will disappear forever from the 
818 face of the Earth. Come see BW in its new incarnation on the internet
819 at www.backwater.com. This system may hang around a little after the 
820 25th, depending on when the plug is finally pulled, but the target
821 date is June 25th 1997. Of course if the system fails before then, I wil
822 not be rebuilding it again. But with luck it will survive until then.
823 May your future be full of happiness and new adventures. Who knows, 
824 we may meet again in some other electronic Inn. And in the immortal 
825 words of William Shatner, "Get a life!" ;-) **** CISTOP MIKEY ****
826 P.S. And thank you all for 16 years of fun and sanity maintance.

830 So it comes at last, the final breath of the Sanyo.  'Tis sad.  Perhaps

842 It has been years upon years since I stopped by this place,
843 and yet I came here by memory alone.  Scattered numbers reassembled
844 easily for having stopped by so often.  Odd that I came by a mere
845 4 days before the inn closes its doors.  Odder still that
846 space still left to write upon.  Farewell, Backwater and thanks
847 for letting me say goodbye.
