22    James walked up the winding stairs, slowly, cautiously. The door at the top was guarded. The guard took one look at
23 him and his sword and didn't waste any time. James ducked under the swing and lashed out with his own blade. The guard
24 fell to the floor in two pieces and died silently. The door was securely locked but he walked through it like it
25 wasn't.
26    It was a bedroom, elegantly made up in fine linens. Crimson was the predominant color, which didn't surprise him
27 much. The man who lived here was warped, not to mention slightly effeminate. There was a large four-poster bed in the
28 middle of the room. He went over and saw that Tariya lay in it, unmoving. Was this guy a necrophile? After an anxious
29 moment James saw the gentle rise and fall of her chest. Just unconcious. She was dressed in a semitransparent
30 nightgown that left little to the imagination and a soft glow surrounded her. He reached out to touch her and jerked
31 his hand back. A force field. It was like grabbing a live wire.
32    Suddenly a strange fog decended over his mind. This time he knew what it was immediately. Before he could turn,
33 though, he was paralyzed by a huge slashing pain in his back. The sword fell from nerveless fingers and vanished. He
34 fell to his knees, head spinning. He didn't know what happened, but it hurt Godawful bad. His left arm was useless.
35 From an immense distance a hateful voice spoke, "So it is you. I had a hunch. You are extremely resilient."
36    James managed to turn and face the Commander, collapsing against the side of the bed. He was dressed in a crimson
37 robe and held a long, thin rapier. It was soaked with blood and James could guess whose. How long before he passed
38 out? Not long, he was sure. "What... what did you do to me?"
39    "I should think that's obvious. I have just killed you again. And this time I shall see that the job is done
40 right."
41    His mind fumbled, trying to think of something. The Commander continued, "Of course, I had to neutralize your
42 formidable abilities first. A simple mindcloud, but very effective. I'M constantly amazed at how far a little magic
43 goes."
44    He couldn't let this animal win. The sword was well beyond his mental grasp in his current state. He had one
45 alternative but he had to keep the sonofabitch too busy to notice until too late. "Isn't it. You seem to... know quite
46 a bit of magic. You're very... good." His voice was weak and shaky.
47    The man smiled and lowered his sword a little. "Yes, I am, aren't I? When I was very young I was a wizard's
48 apprentice. He taught me quite a bit before a got bored and killed him."
49    An egomaniac. Good. James' hand reached slowly, inconspicously, toward his right boot. "You kill a... lot, too. I
50 came across... some of your... handiwork yesterday."
51    "Just some dissidents. Those who wouldn't obey me as I like to be obeyed. I made quite a show of them for the rest.
52 The girl resisted my advances most vehemently and will be joining them later today. Perhaps I shall hang your remains
53 beside her. But enough talk. I am a cautious man, and I believe I should finish you as quickly as I can." He raised
54 the sword again and advanced on James.

160              Civil  strife   ended   with   the  Am-Euro   Federal
161            Act  of 1997.  In actuality,  the  Act  legalized total
162            police  suppression  of any  action  deemed  harmful to
163            the  continued   growth   of   the  State.   Unlicensed  
164            gatherings  of more  than  30  persons  was  considered
165            an act of  civil insurrection.  The ranks of the police
166            grew.  Additional  manpower  had  to  be used  to quell
167            the uneasiness  of the  public  directly  following the
168            inception of  the  new act.  It  was into  this Hellish
169            situation George Gratis found himself.  The former 80's
170            militant,  now 37 year-old  college professor,  took on
171            the state, fighting for liberty and dignity against the
172            powers-that-be.
173 
174         "Wow...What would I do in a situation like that? It's George against
175 the world." Tim Gray set his new science fiction book down on the coffee
176 table. Tim had just purchased "George's War" yesterday at the university book
177 store. Tim was a student studying marketing, a subject he enjoyed very much.
178 His first love would always be science fiction though. He also was a great fan
179 of the every-man story, where an ordinary person overcomes great obstacles
180 by conquering the evil overseers who would usurp freedom. "George's War"
181 was just such a story.
182 
183         Page two...
184 
185              George's position in the education field made him a natural
186            enemy of  the State.  The men who ran  things now  were fully
187            aware  of the  dangers  a  well-educated  man  who  knew  the
188            dangers  of a  police  state could  present.  Students at the
189            university listened  to and respected George's opinion.  They
190            liked him for  what he had stood for in the troubled times of
191            the eighties.  They liked  what  he was  saying  now.  He had
192            always   been   an  enigma  to   the  government.   While  he
193            espoused  the  virtues  of a strong  central government  as a
194            unifying  force  for  the State,  his  arguments were  always
195            tempered   by   warnings   about   power   corrupting.   Even
196            stronger  than  his  feelings  about a  solid State  were his
197            beliefs in personal  freedoms and the  pursuits of individual
198            choice.
199 
200         Looking up at the clock on the wall of his one-room student housing
201 sleeper, Tim realized he was late for class. "Three Dimensional
202 Marketing Strategies for Suburban Penetration." Not a required class, but Tim
203 felt it was important none-the-less. He was a pretty good student who was
204 rarely late for classes, especially those directly in his major. Grabbing his
205 school books and his copy of "George's War", Tim quickly left the sleeper
206 and made his way to class.
207         The marketing prof. was himself not in class yet, so Tim got out his
208 new book and continued reading.

	Bard looked at the monitors into the staterooms.  Piper seemed to
228 
be resting fittfully while Emu and Tayree worked on his wounds.  Trainor
229 
was asleep in his room, with a curious look upon his face.  Bard thought
230 
that it must be a strange dream, not knowing that Trainor wasn't dreaming
231 
at all.  Then he looked at the woman who called herself Aedem.  Standing in
232 
the hallway alone, she also had her eyes closed, concentrating on the
233 
invisible and inaudible conversation that she and Trainor were very
234 
involved in.  Turning back to Cragmore, Bard started to explain his theory.
235 
	"Cragmore, we've already found out that our new arrival comes from
236 
a time frame that seems to move in the reverse of ours.  Given that,
237 
reverse her name, and you get a possible clue as to who she is and what
238 
may have been the circumstances of her exile."
239 
	Trying the suggestion, Cragmore voiced the name "madea ... medae,
240 
... Medea!  Are you saying that she's the analog of the witch Medea?"
241 
	"I'm not saying anything, because I'm not sure.  Yet.  But the more
242 
I think about it, the better it fits.  Try her husband's name, and the
243 
king's name."
244 
	"Nosaj, ... Jason, and Noerc, ... Creon.  Jason of the Argonuats,
245 
and King Creon?"
246 
	"That's what I came up with,"  Bard answered.  "What I'm wondering
247 
is what did she do in her place and time, and did she set up the ZEB effect
248 
on her own, or was it set up for her?"
249 
	"And can we trust her?" Cragmore continued.
250 

251 
	If they had been watching the monitors, they might have seen an
252 
interesting sight: every twitch, blink and muscle spasm in Aedem's face was
253 
exactly echoed in Trainor's face.  Or was Trainor the initiator of those
254 
movements?  By looking at the two, the adventurers might have guessed that
255 
they were involved in a mental discussion.  What even Cragmore wouldn't be
256 
able to discover through the psi-screens was the heated debate going on
257 
between Trainor and Aedem.

293 (Conclusion)
294             
295      I opened my eyes and saw only fuzzy whiteness. Was this the waiting room to Hell or what? I tried to move my head
296 but something restricted my movements. I felt curiously light. And numb.
297      Something moved into my field of vision and my eyes focused on it. My mouth tried to move and a rough parody of a
298 voice croaked out. "Jen-Jennifer? Are you dead too?"
299      She smiled, a little sadly. "No, I'm not dead. And neither are you, though you came close to it. Don't try to
300 talk. You have pneumonia and an inflamed trachea. Not to mention a broken leg."
301      I was able to look down enough to see my right leg in a huge cast held suspended in a traction rig. There were two
302 steel pins through the cast halfway between the knee and ankle. I put my head back trying to make sense of it all.
303 Though it hurt, I spoke again. "Tell... me. What happened?"
304      She frowned and put a finger to my lips. She said sternly, "I'll tell you what I know if you promise to keep your
305 mouth shut. Deal?" I nodded quietly. Then she started her story.
306      She had been driving in a dream. Roy was back, and calling to her. Suddenly the spell broke, and she found herself
307 on the 205 bridge, heading straight for the railing. She screamed and twisted the wheel. The car skidded, and slammed
308 intp the barrier sideways before stopping. She got out in the rain shakily and saw that the concrete had been cracked.
309 She had almost gone through it. She sat there in a daze until a pickup stopped to see what happened. The driver was a
310 ham and used one of those 2-meter talkies to call for the police. She told them she had lost control in the rain. They
311 took her home where she could have a breakdown in peace. She tried to call me but my phone was off the hook. She called
312 my parent's house next and my youngest brother answered, telling her I was in the hospital. He gave her a ride over,
313 where my parents told her the rest.
314      They were shocked and confused. The cops had answered a complaint from the groundskeeper. They had found me,
315 unconcious but alive, laying on top of Roy's body. The body itself was in the same position as I had found it. They
316 wanted very much to talk to me when I was well enough.
317      She stopped because she saw the tears running down my face. She leaned down and hugged me as best she could and
318 whispered, "It's all right. It's all over." I still couldn't help it, though.
319      I keep asking myself, why was I alive? Did Roy run out of steam at the last moment? Or did he just let us go? I
320 don't think I'll ever know. Maybe someday after I'm dead, I'll ask him.
321                                                                        
322      I spent six weeks getting over my pneumonia and busted leg. I used that time to think up a decent explanation for
323 why the cops found me that way. I finally decided on the truth. The judge remanded me to a mental institution for
324 observation. I knew he would, but it beat going up on charges. I left there two months later convinced that
325 psychiatrists were crazier than normal people.
326      Jennifer visited me when they would allow her. The love I thought dead returned with a vengence. We managed to
327 form a bond between us so strong I don't think anything could break it. Not even death.
328      We're living together now, in that house off Fourth Plain. Marriage is a possibility that comes up quite often
329 lately. Her mother hates me, of course, but what the heck.
330      We don't talk on the CB any more, but a lot of our friends do. Whenever we visit them we ask that it's left off
331 but usually sometime during the course of the visit it gets turned on anyway. And sometimes, if the radio is on a quiet
332 channel, my imagination plays tricks on me. Or maybe it's not my imagination. I keep thinking I hear something distant,
333 blended in with the static, and I can't help but wonder if he's still out there.
334      Waiting to try again.
335

338 (I'll participate in the adventure as time permits, but I'm short of that 
339 most precious commodity at the moment.  Hope the pace picks up!)
340   Just a note -- leaving the evolution vs. creation out of it, it does seem
341 reasonable that we could deduce our "natural" diet by looking at our dental
342 and digestive equipment.  What I see is dental equipment made to grind coarse
343 foods to a fine pulp and a fairly sophisticated processing plant.  Most 
344 carnivores have teeth more adapted to tearing off chunks (less chewing)
345 than ours, and simpler digestive systems.  Most herbivores have similar, or
346 more robust teeth, and more complex digestive systems.  The animal that is
347 most similar in digestive equipment is the pig -- a well known omnivore.
348 Granted, we can live on meat alone (if we eat the WHOLE animal UNCOOKED), 
349 and certainly can live on an all-vegetable diet; however, it seems more
350 likely that we "were intended" to subsist on a mixed diet.

387 frustrated young man. And a fierce lack of ego causes you to lie to yourself

443 If  one  looked at a myat,  it would seem to be  a  very  passive 
444 reature,  a lurker in the dark.   It would wait for its prey, no 
445 
matter  what it might be.   It was very nearly truly  omnivorous, 
446 and  its level of activity depended upon the amount of energy  it 
447 ad at that moment.   It could subsist on minerals, if it had to, 
448 
for short periods of time.   However, it did prefer living flesh, 
449 
and would temporarily overextend itself in order to get such.  It 
450 d  the outward appearance of a small ball when in its so called 
451 "true"  form,  which  was actually the  most  convenient.   There 
452 seemed to be no end to the shapes it could assume.   It was  also 
453 very, very intelligent, and by our standards, utterly ruthless.
454 
     It and its kind first appeared in the middle ages,  and were 
455 
the basis for the myths of strange and evil creatures, that we so 
456 ten hear of today.  It was, in its own way, the perfect hunter, 
457 or  very nearly perfect.   It could sense its preys emotions  and 
458 could even feed off of these before it would eat the flesh of the 
459 
prey.  This one had lain dormant for quite a while.

501 The English language is really screwed up, as we all too well know. But today I'm
502 especially ticked off with spelling. Problem #1: no one can do it? Now does that make
503 sense, after all, isn't that what a language is for? I propose a national movement to
504 correct this problem and make the English language easier to spell. First of
505 all, we can start eliminating all the confusing spellings of words like through
506 and subtle and parallel. Rite away, we can see an imediate impruvment over the
507 old sistem.
508 
509 I wud however, keep the 'e' at the end of a werd to make the vowel long. This
510 makes sens to me. But drop it off werds that don't need it. Like positive. Let's just
511 make that positiv.
512 
513 Now, we can esilee see that the 'c' is useles. 'K' and 'S' do all that 'c' duz.
514 So 'c' wil be used just for the 'ch' sownd, and we kan kal it 'ch' if we want.
515 
516 Also, the 'q' is a waste, sins there's nuthing that a 'kw' kan't fix wer a 'Q'
517 is now. So tu simplify matters, we kan make the 'q' take the plase of 'th'.
518 In fakt, we kud kal it 'th'.
519 
520 So now, al qe werds qat used to start wiq 'th' kan now be spelled muc shorter
521 and ezier.
522 
523 Qer ar many oqer sensibl canges we kud make, but qis wud sertanly be a start.

538 *IMPOSTER!*:  A fine joke!  Bravo, bravo!!  Now you're learning how to get 
539 Backwater riled!!!  But, you screwed up!  Know thy subjects before thou pretend
540 to be them.  Most everyone knows that I would use no such language as
541 "jerk"; it's simply not my style.  The lines past 496 are not mine,
542 they are a clever ploy by the IMPOSTER to secret and divert attention from
543 him/herself.  Clever, but not well executed.
544                           Learn your Subject!!!
545 (Afterthought:  For all that all of you know, I could be the IMPOSTER and not
546 the true PEN NAME, for he/she has done so before.  You'll have to draw your
547 own conclusions, or not, but if you notice details like I do, you'll quickly
548 realize who is who, and who is not.  A game in fine spirit and good for the
549 reflexes, tho maybe not physical, in any case. (Such verbosity!))
550                                         The One, the only?,  PEN NAME
551 (Hint:  IMPOSTER, if you have a NEC or like, the chracter known as a "broken
552 bar" or "|" looks the same as a "backslash" or "\".  Therefore, my border, the
553 "broken bar" or "|" looks like the Destroyer's, a "backslash" or "\".  This 
554 has caused confusion before, and has now helped to snare you.  With this hint
555 maybe your performance will improve!)
556                                                       Again, PEN NAME
557 |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
558 p.s.  this is not really me.  I am not pen name, but I was just trying to see
559 how many people would believe I was indeed him after writing the above appeal.
560 For all you know, I, could really be PEN NAME making up this whole charade as
561 a plea for attention.

574 With so many false names on here, it is hard to figure
575 who is telling the truth and who is not. Let me put it another
576 way. No one here uses their real name, they all use fake names
577 in the spirit of the board. The some people with fake names
578 start faking other's fake names, and so on. Now these faked
579 faked names get people riled, so they start using additional
580 faked names against those who faked other fake names. Pretty
581 soon we get so confused that we can't remember who started
582 the fakery and who was the victim. On top of all that, we have
583 people faking other fake names in order to praise their
584 original fake names. Then others fake the fake names that
585 praise the first fake name, and the cycle begins again.
586 Therefore I propose a new edict be layed down here on this
587 system. No more fake names. Everyone use their real name, and
588 everyone be accountable for what they type or say. We must
589 also promise not to fake other real names because that would
590 be cheating. Only the real John Doe can use the name John Doe.
591 If two people have the same real name, they can be separated
592 by numbers or Roman numerals, like John Doe I and John Doe II.
593 This should simplfy things and cut down on the multiple levels
594 of fakery. To start things off, I will sign my name now.
