25   The  smoke-filled  court  room hung  with  tension.  Draped  in

27 ok of superiority. Squirming in their allotted seats the jury 
28 tened unwillingly, often scribbling on their little note-pads or

74      "Brrrrr... Brrrrr..."
75      The wind howled outside and dime-sized drops spattered my window. I finally put the phone down. She hadn't said
76 she was going anywhere tonight. It was strange. Strange and I didn't get along very well these days. Maybe she had
77 talked to somebody on the radio. I switched on my Yaesu and turned it to channel 20, where she usually talked.
78      Crazy Daisy was on, talking to somebody I couldn't hear. Daisy was an older woman that I didn't care for very much
79 but Jen talked to her a lot. I suppose I might have liked Daisy better if she used a different handle. Then again,
80 maybe not. I picked up the mike and asked her if she had talked to Jen lately.
81      "Why yes, I did. Just a little while ago, in fact. She was in her car, going to meet someone."
82      This didn't sound good. "Who?"
83      "She had finally talked that awful spook into staying in one spot long enough to go meet him. I hope she'll be
84 able to stop him finally. He's been causing so much-"
85      "Oh, my God." I didn't listen to the rest of her monologue. My insides had sudenly turned to ice. It took forever
86 for the old bag to shut up so I could ask her, "Where did she go? Did she say?"
87      "No, she didn't say. But I think they were going to try to stay in contact on eleven-"
88      I didn't even wait for her to finish. I spun the dial savagely, overshot the channel, and had to come back again.
89 "Hello? Jennifer! Are you here?" No response. The channel was dead. My heart was hammering in my throat. It was
90 maddening to just sit there, but there were far to may places she could have gone. The radio was my best chance. "Has
91 anybody out there seen or heard Lady Couger tonight?"
92      Missle Commander answered immediately. Missle Commander was an obnoxious little punk a couple years younger than
93 me that I argued with a lot. "I know where she is." He piped up in that squeaky little rat voice of his.
94      "You do? Where?"
95      "Right here with me!"
96      I should have know better than to listen to him but I was too upset to think. "What the hell's she doing over
97 there with you!?"
98      "Here, I'll let you listen." A second later grotesque sucking noises came out of my speaker. After a few moments
99 of that, I heard his voice again. "Ohhhh, that feels SO good! That's what she's doing." In the background there was
100 male laughter.
101      I didn't even wast my time cussing him out. I spun the dial from 1 to 40, listening for her voice. Or his
102 voice.
103      I hit paydirt on my third time around. I couldn't hear him, but I heard her clearly. She sounded like she was in
104 ecstacy. "I'm on my way, Roy! We'll be together soon! I can't wait!"
105      "NOOO!" I yelled. I think my sanity was beginning to come apart a little then.
106      "Jim! What are you doing here?"
107      "Don't do it! He's dead, don't you see? The only way you can join him is if you die, too!"
108      Her reply chilled me to the bone. "As long as I can be with him, I don't care!"
109      "What about me, goddamit?!"
110      "I'm sorry, Jim." was all she would say.
111      The Roy's voice came to me, stronger than hell. It sounded like he was in the room with me. "I told you I was
112 coming for her, Jamesy old boy. Interfere now and I'll send you to a place you never counted on!"
113      "You son of a bitch!" I yelled. "You're dead, dammit! DEAD! You have no right! Go back to hell where you came from
114 and leave us alone!"
115      "No. You leave us alone." A shower of sparks exploded from my thousand doller radio. A huge jolt of electricity
116 shot through the microphone and into me, knocking me on my ass. The radio was useless now, black smoke boiling up from
117 the back.
118      I sat on the floor, cradling my burned hand and crying pitfully. It was hopeless. He had her in some kind of
119 spell. I didn't even know where she was to stop her. I was powerless to save the woman I loved.
120      Or was I?
121      Maybe I didn't know where she was at the moment, but I did know where to find him. About twenty blocks over and
122 six feet down.
123      I was out of there like a rocket.

166 The Bear squinted far up the tunnel, straining to see the marchers. He was
167 squatting by the stream, but he knew there must be better cover. He stood and
168 scurried to the side of the tunnel, in the middle of two of the torches, where
169 neither light could quite penetrate.
170 
171 He hunched up against the wall, standing, with one hand on his sword. The
172 rhythmic marching of the footsteps came closer. Bear looked down, and could
173 see a worn path not ten feet in front of him. He pressed back against the side
174 of the cave as much  as possible, but
175 he knew it would only be the Ladyship's Luck that would keep him from being
176 spied by one of the marchers.
177 
178 The sounds grew closer. He was just around a slight bend of the wall, so he
179 couldn't see what kind of being made the sound until they were nearly upon
180 him. Suddenly he saw the first marchers. They were walking two abreast, and 
181 were definitely humanoid. Each man rested a sword on his shoulder. They 
182 stared straight ahead as they marched with precise skill, grim countenances 
183 staring straight ahead. Not a word, no one counting time. Just simple, eerie, 
184 marching.
185 
186 The column past. Two. Four. Six. The Bear counted... twelve, fourteen.
187 On they marched, none of them looking to either side, which was Bear's only
188 hope for staying hidden. He noted their milky white uniforms- each exactly
189 the same, each with one black stripe down the side, but otherwise drab. Even
190 their boots were the same color.
191 
192 As the eleventh pair passed, Bear barely breathing, even squinting his eyes
193 in case their whites might glint, one of the soldiers coughed quietly and
194 turned his head slightly to the side. Toward Bear. Bear froze.
195 
196 Their eyes met, and the soldier hesitated. Bear hesitated for a second, unsure
197 whether the man would simply pass, or cry out an alarm.
198 
199 When the man's mouth opened in a silent 'O', Bear lept from the side of the
200 wall, sword unsheathing at the same time. With one quick stroke, he lopped
201 off the suprised man's head, still with the 'O' formed at the mouth, but
202 no sound ever reached the lips. With a blur of speed, Bear slashed again, at
203 the man who was behind his first victim. Another thrust, and a third was down.
204 
205 But by that time, the commotion had caused the other soldiers to turn, and
206 gather their senses. Swords withdrew, and the soldiers attacked Bear.
207 
208 Another slash of the sword, and another, but soon the numbers were two great
209 for Bear. Three swords pointed straight at his throat, four more at his
210 heart. At Bear's feet lay five men.
211 
212 Without a word, without hardly a change in facial expression, the men stripped
213 him of his sword, and bound him with a rope with seemed to almost magically
214 appear from the crowd of soldiers surrounding Bear. The tied his wrists behind
215 him with a vicious tug, and then wrapped several more coils around his body.
216 
217 With a jab of a sword in his back, Bear was pushed on, downriver the way
218 the soldiers had been marching. Bear looked at his captors, puzzled. Not a
219 sound, save their marching boots. They barely looked at him, and would no
220 t meet his eyes.
221 
222 And they marched on, down the river, from a place Bear did not know, to a 
223 place he did not know. And the quiet river flowed lazily by, and the only
224 sound were the precise clomping of 42 feet.
225 
226 00000000000000000000000000000 THE BEAR 000000000000000000000000000000000000000

236 Dear Steve,
237 
238 Well, gee. I still haven't heard from you. I understand that you probably feel it's my assignment and you don't have to
239 bother with it, so why write back, right?
240 
241 Well, I'll tell you why mister. I'm your brother. Doesn't that count for anything anymore? I mean, we had the same mother, and 
242 Dad insists he fathered us both, and, well, it just means a lot to me, y'know?
243 
244 I just, just, well, I always hated your guts to tell you the truth. You always got everything, all the new clothes, you
245 got to watch your TV shows, you even got first pick on all the girls. Well, I'll tell you something buster. Remember
246 when you we up and there was shaving cream in your ear? And when you stood up you stepped in mushed-up bananas on the floor? And247 then after you managed to slip and slide your way into the bathrooom and took a shower there was red dye in the shower
248 head? And when you reached for the towel there was honey all over it? And when you ran upstairs to try and find me Mom
249 grounded you for a week for making such a mess, and you missed that big party?
250 
251 Well, that wasn't me. That was my friend Ricky Robbins.
252 
253 But I woulda done it. I hate you Steve. I hate the way you look, I hate your nose. I always hated your nose, it looks
254 like a big slug landed on your face. So just go chew up some mothballs Steve. I never want to see you again!

301 In one of the darker corners of the Inn, upon a table currently unoccupied,
302 a small vellum scroll slowly drifted into being.  Its struggle for existence
303 was clear; it dimmed several times, only to return a bit stronger than before.
304 At last, it was completely solid.  As if on cue, it unrolled itself flat upon
305 the oak surface, to allow anyone who cared to read it:
306 'Dear friends,
307     I am arriving soon in my new transport.  Please tell Bert Rebalsa and
308 Stan Wendill that I have something extremely important to tell them when I
309 arrive.
310                                         Milch'
311 The scroll remained for a few moments, and indeed a passing ant paused for aa
312 few moments to peruse the paper.  Then, more rapidly than it arrived, the
313 scroll lost it's hard-won existence and misted into nothingness.

385 My dearest Bruce,
386      Everything is going according to your masterful plan.  Delta 5 is 
387 rushing to Switzerland bent on destroying McKane.  He will be disappointed,
388 I fear.  Leroy is still in hiding and d'Autun is managing a sausage factory
389 in the south of France.  Projections indicate they will sit this one out,
390 but one can never tell about Leroy.
391      The plot to assasinate Wassir failed as you expected.  Poor Johann and
392 Guido, they never had a chance against the Albanian.  He and the Bolivian
393 woman are expected to check-in at the Bogart Arms tomorrow.  Be careful with
394 those two, I cannot project their actions with any reliability.  No need to
395 fret about Salazar, he's still wandering around the Amazon puckerbrush,
396 chasing Herr Rommel's secretary.... a romantic fool to the end.
397      Both the NET and Underground are showing a heightened activity level.
398 It is safe to assume that their agents will be involved in the affair soon,
399 not that it will do them any good.
400      I do have one bone to pick with you.  The Extra Edge (tm) computer
401 you stuck me with is a dog.  2K of RAM and Bronx Basic don't give me alot
402 to work with.  All the blasted thing will print out is "BEAT ME BIG BOY".
403 Don't we have room in the budget for a nice Atari?
404      Give my regards to Professor Stuffit.  I'm sure you'll convince him
405 to help us in short order.  Speaking of short, the shipment of zirconium-
406 encrusted elevator shoes is enroute and should arrive at about the same
407 time as the pin-tailed ducks.
408                                With all my love,
409                                China Blue

417 Maybe with this cold you're just reading slower...
418 
419 Speaking of which,  this &'&")("!!! cold has got me real screwed up. To save
420 money, we're heating the house with nothing but firewood. Which was great
421 when it was 56 degrees outside. Now... it's a challenge. But we still 
422 haven't turned it on! More sweaters... more wood, longer hot showers... more
423 heating pads... cheating by drying our hair longer with the blow dryer... 
424 but still no electric heat!
425 
426 However, we may not have heat, but don't tell my dog. The stupid bitch 
427 (Mikey- that's not a swear word. She really is one!) decided this would
428 be a great time to go into heat. And just when we sealed the deck off
429 (where she normally resides during the drip-drip-drip of heat... if you've 
430 never had a dog in heat... you can't appreciate the grossity of the
431 bloody (that can either be a swear word, English style, or an adjective
432 properly describing the situation) situation.
433 
434 Anyway, so here she is, we have to keep her indoors (else her rear might
435 freeze to the ground at night), but since it's Sunday and we're broke until
436 tomorrow we can't go get any of those doggie diapers (they really do have 
437 them). So we took some old underwear, cut a hole in the back for her tail,
438 and hoped to catch most of the, uh, residue that way.
439 
440 Only a partial success... and a hilarious looking dog. And we have to slip
441 the dumb thing off everytime she wants to go outside and poop.
442 
443 And we can't lock her in a back room because last time we did that she 
444 chewed the frame off and then part of the door, and finally got out during
445 the middle of the night. It was with her puppies who then ran around the
446 house pooping and peeing all over the place.
447 
448 I love my dog.

488      Heading for his three-wheeler, Ralph loped down the front steps, his
489 Panama hat in hand and his fake leopard skin briefcase chained to his
490 wrist. No heat stroke for this ace Fuller Brush man. No sirree. He didn't
491 care a whit that in this dust bowl paradise, Fresno to the locals, Grit
492 Pits to the visitors, it was 110 in the shade. Only crazies biked anywhere.
493 Organics, too. No, Ralph, the Fuller Brush man, had a job to do. He'd
494 stay as cool as a dog's nose in June.
495      While Millie fixed his poached egg (two and a half minutes maz-- that
496 way the white stayed slippery and he was convinced that real men eat the
497 jelly white when it's googly), Ralph outlined in day-glo green on his Stan
498 Wiley foldout the neighborhood for the day's big sell: foxtail brushes in
499 four sizes and Puce Blue painy. Ralph pronounced it Puke Blue because he
500 liked the sound of the two words together and couldn't remember puce.
501      Ralph believed himself to be the picture of success. Now, he bought
502 whenever he wanted pairs of plain pants from the Arnold Palmer Sportsman
503 Shop at Sears. Millie got the Helene Curtis manicure set she coveted.
504 Ralph, Jr. spent nearly all his free time with the vintage erector set
505 Ralph gave him last Christmas. When he couldn't fiddle around with the set,
506 Ralph, Jr. complained that he had to take the garbage out too often and
507 that the kids at school called him "Patsy." Butch, the pimply stud in
508 Block 3, especially tormented him. "Hay Patsy, your old man got stopped
509 by the cops for speeding." That was usually the opener.
510      It's true Ralph got stopped but not for speeding. His three wheeler
511 made people stare. Maybe it was the fake leopard skin briefcase; maybe it
512 was the iridescent pink safety flag with the skull and crossbones. Well
513 Ralph had a job to do. He had Puke and Foxtail to sell today.

526    As the XKE slid around the corner onto Westlake Avenue, the driver frantically sca
527 He was going the wrong way. In his haste to get away from the minor incident at the Warwick, he had made a
528 wrong turn. He was headed toward Lake Union, and the floating bridge, that would take him to Belleview
529 and he had little time to waste. The bright yellow Jaguar stood out like a neon sign, that every cop
530 in Seattle
531 would be looking for. Soon. The last thing he needed was to have to take out a couple cops. He flew past
532 the marina, and a First Interstate Bank, and then it hit him-THE CANNISTER!. He hadn't had the time to search the
533 two men he had killed, and he had to get that nerve gas. And the formula that was inside.
534 
535 

536 Something was nagging at him, and he was almost fratic in his attempt to -THE KEYS! He slammed on the brakes, spun
537 the XKE into the parking lot of Charley's and leapt out. The valet would park it if he could find the keys-they were
538 strewn about the car as Delta Five ripped from the chain the one he wanted. The one that he had seen hnging there 
539 when he first started up the Jaguar. That was what had been nagging at him-it was a key to a safe deposit box...
540 
541    Delta walked almost casually into the restaurant his outward calmness belying the near panic inside him.
542    He went to the bar and ordered a Budweiser, and then got up, as if to visit the restroom, but slipped out the side
543 door, and, walking bask up Westlake, hailed a cab. "Vance Hotel, and I'll pay the speeding ticket", he said, as he 
544 handed the driver a fifty. Delta checked into the once fashionable but now decaying hotel, and hurried up to room 410.
545    A few minutes later, he hung up the phone. He ha the information he wanted. Leaving through the kitchen entrance
546 he flagged another cab, and an hour and a half later, he was in Portland. On the plane, he had made a rough but fective
547 sketch, and took this to a machine shop near 150th and Burnside. The five one hundred dollar bills he handed the shop
548 foreman confirmed what Delta already knew. It would be ready in an hour. Operating as if there were no time left
549 he caught another cab to a nearby shopping center, and at a coin shop, he bought an assortment of old coins, picked
550 up a five pound hammer at a hardware store, and headed back to the machine shop...

554 Obviously Mr. Bit Bucket, while having some sort of an idea (I can't say its a good one, because it's hard to decipher
555 what the heck he had to say; although I assume he was referring to another Backwater(?)), has no idea as to the
