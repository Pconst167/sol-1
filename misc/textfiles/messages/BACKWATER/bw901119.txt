 28 Well, looks like somebody needs to get this disk roling.  To bad I missed
 29 being at the top.
 30  
 31 I guess I'll fill space with twin peaks musings.  First, Its a great show.
 32 They've had some bad episodes, but only two that I can remember.  Not 
 33 bad, as that means they have managed to be atleast good in 14 out of 16
 34 hours (The two season premiers were two hours each.)
 35  
 36 Now, You all may have noticed that the ratings have been droping.  Heres
 37 some thoughts as to why this is happening.  
 38  
 39 1.  The show is to bloody complex for most people.  I've seen many posts
 40 in alt.tv.twin-peaks flaming the show, that later turned out to be silly
 41 because people just didn't understand what was going on.
 42  
 43 2.  It isn't like anything else on TV.  People have come to expect certain
 44 things.  For the most part, these things never come to pass.  This drives
 45 many people nuts.  They don't like it when things don't go by the rules
 46 that they understand.  Makes them feel stupid, and TV has long been in the
 47 business of making everyone feel like a genius.
 48  
 49 3.  It isn't a happy show.  The characters are not perfect, and very bad
 50 things happen to them.  After Maddys death, I wasn't at all happy with 
 51 the show.  I still don't like the fact that it happened, but I'm 
 52 begining to get an idea of where things are going, and it all fits in 
 53 rather well.  I'd say that Donna is going to have some interesting times
 54 soon.
 55  
 56 That covers most of my ideas as to reasons.  It makes me laugh everytime
 57 I see a critic put down twin peaks.  They are obviosly missing about
 58 half of what is going on.  Oh, I'm not sure anybody under then age of
 59 16 should be allowed to see this show.  Of course, chances are they wouldn't
 60 understand most of it anyway.

147 AD: I agree with your thoughts on why TP in slipping in the ratings. Just like
148 the education system, the government, the news papers, and and endless stream
149 of crap we are subjected to, *everything* is geared towards the average
150 citizen, which of course doesn't exist. But the people really affected by
151 this targeting of material are those farthest away from the Norm. Smart kids
152 and slow kids suffer in school. Everyone suffers because politicians are too
153 busy playing politics, people get their news from television talking-head
154 news readers, and Twin Peaks falls in the ratings because the majority of
155 people would rather watch safe television like Cosby or Head of the Class
156 or Wheel of Fortune. It's Ok for people to watch stuff like that, but what
157 I object to is the constant weight of the so-called average majority stifling
158 creative projects like Twin Peaks. TP makes people think, makes people sad,
159 makes people mad, and makes people wonder. Another thing the show uses is
160 this strange technique used a great deal in some books and some movies, but
161 seen once a decade on television : symbolism. Things represent concepts,
162 ideas, or objects that go beyond simple identification. One must think
163 when one watches TP as to what one is *really* seeing. What does the
164 traffic light mean? What impending doom do the swaying trees and the howling
165 wind signify? What do the dreams mean, above and beyond the obvious? All
166 of these extras make the show that much more enjoyable, and that much more
167 difficult to sit back with a can of beer and figure out. So The Legendary
168 Neilsen Families are probably going to kill another unique show because
169 they are all stuck in the mediocrity of the least common denominator 
170 syndrome that is running rampant in this country.
171  
172 Twin Peaks is just another symbol of what is wrong, and its eventual
173 death will b another blow against intellectualism and irony and another
174 victory for Average-ness.

182 I'm not sure that I understand the uh uh message.  (BTW, I agree with you

184  
185 Was the person who left the uh uh message trying to say that symbolism and
186 intelectualism are meerly delusions that some people suffer from?  I would
187 point out to this person that Lynch has I believe said in the past that
188 he puts symbolism into his stories on purpose.  There are many in Twin Peaks.
189 The Street Light, the Log,  BOB and MIKE, The Plastic, The letters under
190 the nails of BOBS victoms, nadines eye patch etc.
191  
192 What many of them mean is still open to speculation.  But they are there, and
193 we are constantly taunted with clues as to were they fit in the puzzle.
194  
195 It is a defense of the intelectually lazy to put down the icons of those
196 that they feel threatened by.  No surprise there I suppose.  The human 
197 race has shown itself to be a woefull kludge.

203    The Tree Is Your Friend by Bob Fried
204  
205 Just in case you are thinking of taking a 6-fn8
206 oot Standard Widespread Ficus for a
207 ride some evening in your Chevy Celebrity sedan, I want you to know that it CAN
208 be done -- not that I would recommend it.  In fact, if you often notice a desir
209 to take your leafy friends for a spin, I'd recommend therapy.
210  
211 Nevertheless, I drove such a tree from Cambridge to Amherst, New Hampshire one
212 night recently.  It was a "fake" tree, so I wasn't really worried about it
213 messing up the interior of my impeccable automobile, and you shouldn't worry
214 either.
215  
216 What is the first thing you do with a fake tree when you get it home? If you're
217 smart, you give it to your spouse and let her (or him, should you be one of
218 those who prefers a male spouse) worry about it. Being smart, I presented the
219 tree to my spouse.
220  
221 "There it is," said I.  "Enjoy it, Carolyn -- your very own fake ficus."
222 Carolyn found that the first thing to enjoy about a fake ficus is the task of
223 making it look "at home" in your home.  You see, when they ship fake trees,
224 they're not too careful about arranging the twigs and leaves attractively.  So,
225 that job is up to you.  It is not a simple matter to bend the twigs in a way
226 that would convince an expert that Mother Nature herself placed the ficus next
227 to the TV set.  Which is why it's a good idea to let your spouse worry about it
228  
229 While Carolyn was busy wrestling with the tree, I removed the diamond-shaped ta
230 and started reading it:
231  
232                      Hello
233                    My name is
234                      #773
235  
236 Yes, there is something eerie about standing in your own living room and readin
237 a note from a tree that moments earlier shared a 50-mile car ride with you.
238  
239 The note continued:
240   I am fade resistant and waterproof, so
241   use me indoors or out.  I require very
242   little maintenance.  For years of
243   enjoyment, simply remove material
244   covering cement. Place me under a
245   gentle shower of warm water.  Be sure
246   to pour off excess water in pot.
247   Then shake me gently, and allow
248   2 to 3 hours to dry.  Replace covering
249   material.  Your plant (me) is ready
250   for an encore.
251  
252 It is not entirely clear to me what the tree does for an encore, and I will try
253 to avoid finding out.  But I'll let you know if this ficus does anything other
254 than stand attractively next to the TV.  If you don't hear from me, you can
255 assume that it's OK to get one for your own spouse.  I'll even be happy to tell
256 you where.

265 CHARACTERS FOUND AND LOST, from UNIVERSAL MYTHS by A. Eliot, w/intros by

267  
268 How did man first learn to read and write?  It is possible that ibis (crane) 
269 tracks in the mud inspired the cuneiform clay printings of Babylonian scribes.
270 Who knows?
271  
272 The ancient Egyptians maintained that their god Thoth, who had the head of
273 an ibis, taught them how to write.  Thoth boasted to the other celestial
274 dieties of his gift, whereupon they giggled rudely.  The sun god Ra asked
275 what Thoth's purpose had been.  "Why," croaked the ibis-headed one, "to
276 help men remember things."  Ra roared with laughter.  "You," he said,
277 pointing at Thoth, "have given human beings the means to forget every-
278 thing they know.  They won't need to remember anymore.  They'll simply note
279 things down, like idiots, without a thought or care."

308 I have for sale the best !Project! for the environmentally oriented tinkerer. 
309 An Electric powered vehicle!!!  This is a volkwagon bug based kit car called 
310 the Bradley GT which has been converted to an electric propulsion system.  The 
311 conversion is based on a kit provided by a man named Kaylor in CA.  It uses a 
312 17 HP 400Amp generator/starter as the drive motor.  I have a cascaded relay 
313 switching system to provide the power to the system.  I've had this project for
314 about 10 years and have really lost interest in it.  I've spent about $3500 on 
315 it and there is still work to be done.  If you have any experience in Fiberglas
316 and electronics this would be an exciting toy to complete.  The finished 
317 vehicle will go for about an hour at 35-45 MPH and would be great for a commute
318 of about 10 miles, with only moderate hills.  If you have any interest, or know
319 of someone who might, give me a call and let's talk.  I'd like to see someone 
320 complete it.  It would be a neat, inexpensive car for trips to the store and 
321 such.  My numbers are Home:(530)640-xxxx and Work:(503)227-xxxx.

327         LUCKY MAN
328  
329 There in his chair sits the Lucky Man
330 His famous paintings and marbled floors
331 are filled with the hopes of his innocence
332 Down empty hallways and corridors.
333  
334 See the stranger on the shore
335 across the room and through the door
336 to have it all and still want more...
337  
338 For everything that's come and gone
339 the life you struggled for and won
340 'til everything is said and done...
341  
342  
343 To win the game you have to score
344 Sell to the rich and mock the poor
345 The accusations kill the store...
346  
347 For promises you give and take
348 Decisions that you've failed to make
349 Could this have been your big mistake...
350  
351 Up with a start wakes the Lucky Man
352 He wakes from nightmares and prays for dawn,
353 Collecting his thoughts he lays back again
354 His troubled dreaming still goes on.
355  
356 Feel the wind and raindrops pour.
357 You fear the chant and lion's roar
358 You've heard a thousand times before...
359  
360 The dreams and visions that you face,
361 floating alone through time and space
362 something inside you can't erase..
363  
364 For everything that's come and gone
365 the life you struggled for and won
366 'til everything is said and done.....

383 Well, last saturdays episode of twin peaks was what seems to be the closure of 
384 the Laura Palmer Story.  It was a very good episode.  Most of it seemed
385 to be more symbol and image oriented then reality based.  This worked well,
386 as many mysteries were being explained.  There was some very powerfull 
387 acting, great lines and an overall feel that was increadable.  All in all,
388 I'd say this was easily the best of the non Lynch directed episodes, and
389 perhaps the best of the entire series.

391 Things to notice,  Why is Donna suddenly wearing her hair like maddy did?
392 Will this continue, and if so, what does it mean?
393  
394 The show IS self consistent.  Don't believe anyone who says it isn't.
395  
396 Its sometimes hard to tell the red herrings from the true clues.  Heres a 
397 hint.  There are NO red herrings.  Only misinterpretations.

405 Another thing that might be overlooked regarding school administration, is
406 that many administrators are in fact teachers-on-special-assignment.  This
407 will probably make it look like these are actual teaching staff, when actually
408 they are not.  "Extended pay" for extra duty may be listed under something
409 else entirely ... who knows????   But there is also the danger of most 
410 conflict being non-negotiable because the support staff union supposedly
411 protects the "rights" of both support and teaching staff; surely a conflict
412 of interest.  From my observation, this seems to be a ploy to use one group
413 against the other, working mostly for the benefit of senior administrators and
414 the Board of Education.

454 Interesting developments in the PPS "mole-station" case.  First they blame

456 case, then they go on to charge the lawyer of extortion.  Wonderful people,
457 huh?  These people have got all Portland's children for a large percentage
458 of their young lives!!!  I hope Mr. Wadsworth AND the parents both sue the
459 district up one side and down the other, along with the lawyer.  Seems to me

476 I never got mine finished unfortunetly.  I kept trashing Turbo Debuger 2.0.  
477 Not an easy thing to do with pascal, but apparently I have a gift for it with
478 C.  Mind you, this was with the 386 version running.  The debuger would 
479 just exit and leave me at the DOS prompt.  I ended up doing better then I
480 thought I would after I found out what my final score was, but not nearly
481 as well as I thought I should have done.  Oh well, thats what I get for 
482 taking compiler design without having taken either of the discrete(sp?) 
483 structures classes or Calculas.  Next term should be even more fun.  Who
484 needs sleep anyway?  :-)

502 the very least, he has been removed from the story in a very wierd and

518 TORTURE
519  
520 What goes on in the pauses
521 of this conversation?
522 Which is about free will
523 and politics and the need for passion.
524  
525 Just this: I think of the woman
526 they did not kill.
527 Instead they sewed her face
528 shut, closed her mouth
529 to a hole the size of a straw,
530 and put her back on the streets,
531 a mute symbol.
532  
533 It doesn't matter where
534 this was done or why or whether
535 by one side or the other;
536 such things are done as soon
537 as there are sides
538  
539 and I don't know if good men
540 living crisp lives exist
541 because of this woman or in spite
542 of her
543     But power
544 like this is not abstract, it's not concerned
545 with politics and free will, it's beyond slogans
546  
547 and as for passion, this
548 is its intricate denial,
549 the knife that cuts lovers
550 out of your flesh like tumors,
551 leaving you breastless
552 and without a name,
553 flattened, bloodless, even your voice
554 cauterized by too much pain,
555  
556 a flayed body untangled
557 string by string and hung
558 to the wall, an agonized banner
559 displayed for the same reason
560 flags are.

570 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH ... FOR THE BLACK UNITED FRONT!!!!  **SOMEBODY** is
571 doing **SOMETHING**!!  Seems like the only group doing anything any-
572 more.  Hope most of PPS joings in.  The districtsure seems to be striking out
573 alot lately.  It's wonderful!!!  The more pressure put on them, the more
574 they're gonna show their "true colors" ... like the recent statement
575 that the "molestation" "victims'" lawyer asked for money to keep quiet
576 about the district.  
577  
578  
579 I heard Norma Paulus shortly after the election stating many teachers are
580 unhappy about the way they're treated and that she has a whole army behind
581 her to institute change.  I believe she said teachers wanted to be treated
582 like adults.  If the way I was treated by PPS is any indication, the dis-
583 trict has a LONG, LONG way to go.  I have a written finding from a very high
584 administrator stating I needed to check out with the head secretary whenever
585 I left my desk ... like I was a third grader that needed a hall pass.  This
586 is probably not only against the law and union rules, but showed an extremely
587 poor management style and total lack of problem solving.  The head secretary
588 worked in a different office not only from me but from the receptionist, who
589 would have to be notified both when I left and when I came back.  Of course,
590 none of the other secretaries in the other offices of the department had to
591 do that!   To top that off, the union suddenly refused to arbitrate on the
592 case after they had promised to do so, had processed the paperwork and 
593 appointed an arbitrator!  They cornered me in the boiler room the day of my
594@another district administrator.  What goings on.
595@ 
596 friend's memorial service and screamed at me (both of them) that they wanted to
597 settle the whole thing through another district administrator.  They browbeat
598 me for almost two hours, I believe.  
599  
600 And that's just a FRACTION of what I went through.

608  
609 Children do not always mean
610 hope.  To some they mean despair.
611 This woman with her hair cut off
612 so she could not hang herself
613 threw herself from a rooftop, thirty
614 times raped & pregnant by the enemy
615 who did this to her.  This one had her pelvis
616 broken by hammers so the child
617 could be extracted.  Then she was thrown away,
618 useless, a ripped sack.  This one
619 punctured herself with kitchen skewers
620 and bled to death on a greasy
621 oilcloth table, rather than bear
622 again and past the limit.  There
623 is a limit, though who knows 
624 when it may come? Nineteenth-century
625 ditches are littered with small wax corpses
626 dropped there in terror.  A plane
627 swoops too low over the fox farm
628 and the mother eats her young.  This too
629 is Nature.  THink twice then
630 before you worship turned furrows, or pay
631 lip service to some full belly
632 or other, or single out one girl to play
633 the magic mother, in blue
634 & white, up on that pedestal,
635 perfect & intact, distinct
636 from those who aren't.  Which means
637 everyone else.  It's a matter
638 of food & available blood.  If mother-
639 hood is sacred, put
640 your money where your mouth is. Only
641 then can you expect the coming 
642 down to the wrecked & shimmering earth
643 of that miracle you sing
644 about, the day 
645 when every child is a holy birth.

665 NOTES TOWARDS A POEM
666 THAT CAN NEVER BE WRITTEN
667  
668 (For Carolyn Forche')
669  
670 i
671  
672 This is the place
673 you would rather not know about
674 this is the place that will inhabit you,
675 this is the place you cannot imagine,
676 this is the place that will finally defeat you
677  
678 where the word WHY shrivels and empties
679 itself.  This is famine.
680  
681  
682 ii
683  
684 There is no poem you can write
685 about it, the sandpits
686 where so many were buried
687 & unearthed, the unendurable
688 pain still traced on their skins.
689  
690 This did not happen last year
691 or forty years ago but last week.
692 This has been happening,
693 this happens.
694  
695 We make wreaths of adjectives for them,
696 we count them like beads,
697 we turn them into statistics & litanies
698 and into poems like this one.
699  
700 Nothing works.
701 They remain what they are.
702  
703  
704 iii
705  
706 The woman lies on the wet cement floor
707 under the unending light,
708 needle marks on her arms put there
709 to kill the brain
710 and wonders why she is dying.
711  
712 She is dying because she said.
713 She is dying for the sake of the word.
714 It isi her body, silent
715 and fingerless, writing this poem.
716  
717  
718 iv
719  
720 It resembles an operation
721 but it is not one
722  
723 nor despite the spread legs, grunts
724 & blood, it is a birth.
725  
726 Partly it's a job,
727 partly it's a display of skill
728 like a concerto.
729  
730 It can be done badly
731 or well, they tell themselves.
732  
733 Partly it's an art.
734  
735  
736 v
737  
738 The facts of this world seen clearly
739 are seen through tears;
740 why tell me then
741 there is something wrong with my eyes?
742  
743 To see clearly and without flinching,
744 without turning away,
745 this is agony, the eyes taped open
746 two inches from the sun.
747  
748 What is it you see then?
749 Is it a bad dream, a hallucination?
750 Is it a vision?
751 What is it you hear?
752  
753 The razor across the eyeball
754 is a detail from an old film.
755 It is also a truth.
756 Witness is what you must bear.
757  
758  
759 vi
760  
761 In this country you can say what you like
762 because no one will listen to you anyway,
763 it's safe enough, in this country you can try to write
764 the poem that can never be written,
765 the poem that invents
766 nothing and excuses nothing,
767 because you invent and excuse yourself each day.
768  
769 Elsewhere, this poem is not invention.
770 Elsewhere, this poem takes courage.
771 Elsewhere, this poem must be written
772 because the poets are already dead.
773  
774 Elsewhere, this poem must be written
775 as if you are already dead,
776 as if nothing can be done
777 or said to save you.
778  
779 Elsewhere you must write this poem
780 because there is nothing more to do.

845 "CHRIST IN CHRISTMAS?" By Dr. James R. Hines
846  
847 Factually, and historically, and sensibly, Christmas is supposed to be the 
848 celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. Of course, no one knows exactly 
849 what date He was born.  Even the exact year is a matter ofa wsconjecture.  
850 Christians have chosen to celebrate the glorious event on the 25th of 
851 December.  But every year it seems that there is a little less emphasis on 
852 Christ during the Christmas season. Gradually, Christ is being removed from 
853 Christmas!
854  
855 This began years ago in a very quiet and subtle manner. First, there was the 
856 introduction of Santa Claus, to get the children so excited about reindeer 
857 and a fat man passing out presents, that they would scarcely have time or 
858 interest left for the Christ child.  It is amazing that the One who is the 
859 "truth" should be supplanted by one who is a lie, but that is the way it has 
860 been.  Then there was the promotion of the word "Xmas" as an abbreviation for 
861 Christmas.  Not that there seems to be any shortage of ink or paper to write 
862 any other long words, but it was a nice and easy way to eliminate "Christ" 
863 from "Christmas".  Another of these rather devious means of eliminating 
864 Christ's influence from the season was the introduction of parties, 
865 revellings, drunkenness and the "office party" to the season.  Certainly, 
866 this is a big part of the season to most people.  Strange, though, that when 
867 it is someone else's birthday, we invite them, honor them, and celebrate it 
868 with them.  But when it is the celebration of Christ's birthday, most can 
869 enjoy all the parties and festivities without even a thought of Christ.
870  
871 More recently, the removal of Christ from Christmas is being carried out in a 
872 more blatant and overt fashion.  Now it is an all out attack to get Christ 
873 removed from the season. this attack is carried on in the courts and seeks to 
874 eliminate any reference to Christianity from public places and public 
875 activities.  Due to the influence of these atheists and ACLU activists, most 
876 public school children can no longer sing Christian carols during the 
877 Christmas season. Manger scenes have to be removed from city squares, parks 
878 and municipal buildings.  Crosses displayed on city water tanks have to come 
879 down.  Just as the inn of Bethlehem had no room for the Saviour when He was 
880 born, the public place, the market place, and city hall have no room for the 
881 Son of God today.
882  
883 Why is it that some of these individuals and groups are so zealous in their 
884 efforts to get Christ out of Christmas? There are reasons: some bogus and one 
885 genuine.  The first artificial reason given is that any display of the manger 
886 scene or mention of the Christ child might offend someone of a different 
887 religion.  But what kind of a hollow, specious reason is that?  Is this not 
888 America, a land of diversity where people can express themselves, worship as 
889 they please and hold whatever opinions they choose?  Am I to be "offended" 
890 because I encounter an opinion I disagree with? Am I to be "offended" because 
891 Jewish people talk about the Passover, or I see a Muslim praying to Allah?  
892 Of course not. This is America.  I may disagree with someone but still 
893 respect his right to whatever beliefs he chooses.  Only the bigot is offended 
894 because he encounters a different opinion than his own.  Why is it that those 
895 who would remove Christ from Christmas worry about Christians offending 
896 others, but never seem to be concerned about their anti-god ideas offending us?
897  
898 A second phony reason given by these anti-Christ zealots is the notion that 
899 we must maintain the separation of church and state.  "Don't you understand," 
900 they ask, "that our constitution guarantees the separation of church and 
901 state?" This tune has been sung so loudly and so often, that people are 
902 actually believing that it is unconstitutional for any government property 
903 and activity to be in any way associated with anything religious.  Such 
904 u*Nnotions may be the result of brainwashing be the atheists, but are in no way
905 rted in historical fact.  The Bill of Rights decrees simply, that congress 
906 shall make no law establishing a religion.  That is all it says and that is 
907 all it means.  Hanging a cross on a water tower is not making a law or 
908 establishing a religion. Neither is the displaying of a manger scene.  The 
909 framers of our constitution accepted the fact that this was a nation 
910 established with belief in Christian principles.  While they would not allow 
911 any particular denomination to be declared the official state religion, they 
912 accepted and encouraged the participation of Christianity in every phase of 
913 public and governmental life.  There was never any intention on their part to 
914 remove Christianity from the public domain.
915  
916 There is a real reason why these people wish to get Christ out of Christmas.  
917 It is not as high sounding as the phony reasons, but it is the real force 
918 behind their actions. Simply put, they hate God.  They do not want to obey 
919 Him. They are afraid to face Him.  In their lives they will deny Him, so in 
920 their efforts they must try to remove Him.  The holiness of Christ convicts 
921 them.  The acceptance of Christ frustrates them.  The worship of Christ 
922 appalls them.  The salvation offered by Christ, condemns them.  Instead of 
923 surrendering, they will fight.  They will push and protest, litigate and 
924 agitate and stop at nothing to remove Christ from public view.
925  
926 These people should face reality and recognize the futility of their task.  
927 History has shown that Christ cannot be destroyed.  They can pass laws but 
928 they cannot outlaw god. They may turn off the Christmas lights, but the light 
929 of the gospel will still shine.  They can remove the cradle and the cross, 
930 but they cannot remove the Christ.  And someday they will fall on their knees 
931 before Him and confess that He is the Lord God.
932  
933 Now you, friend, are probably not going around smashing nativity scenes and 
934 taking down crosses, but if you do not give Christ His rightful place in your 
935 heart and in your home this Christmas, you are not much different than these 
936 transgressors.  Worship Christ.  give your heart to Him. Read His Word.  
937 Attend church to hear it preached.  Put Christ into your Christmas.

958 12/31/90 Quayle Notebook By RITA BEAMISH
959    RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Vice President Dan Quayle's decision to play
960 golf at an American course that bars women is following him to a country that
961 forbids them to drive cars or socialize or work with men.
962    Quayle cut short an outing last Friday at the Cypress Point Golf Course in
963 Pebble Beach, Calif., after learning it was the subject of controversy because
964 it had no black members.
965    But he said Sunday he'll continue to play at the male-only Burning Tree Club
966 in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Md., where he is an honorary member by
967 virtue of his office.
968    "I've played there before and I'll play there again,"' he said when
969 questioned by reporters traveling with him to visit U.S. troops in the Persian
970 Gulf region.
971    "I'm not going to protest Burning Tree," he said. "Maybe they'll change. I
972 think it would be a good idea for them to take women into the club. I don't hav
973 any problem playing there in the meanwhile."
974    Further, he noted, "There are a lot other very well-respected people that
975 have played at Burning Tree."

977 Is one to assume from Quayle's comment that he is a "very well-respected"
978 person, or just that he THINKS he is?
