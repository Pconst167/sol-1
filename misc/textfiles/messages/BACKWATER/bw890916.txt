 33 According to my CRC Handbook, Earth's semimajor axis of orbit is about 1.50 *
 34 10 E 8 kilometers, Jupiter's is about 7.78 *10E8 k's, or about 5.19 times as
 35 far out; the inverse square law says sunlight at J is 26.9 times dimmer. Solar
 36 power is considered usable out to about Mars, 2.28 *10E8 k's, where sunlight is
 37 2.31 times dimmer than here. We get about 1 kilowatt per square meter (above
 38 atmosphere), a good photoelectric cell recovers about 8 percent of that, with

 41    As far as plutonium being a deadly poison, or even as the claims read "the
 42 deadliest poison on earth", if falls far short. Radiation is cumulative, so a
 43 radioactive substance can be described by the time multiplied by the quantity
 44 that will kill you, for plutonium a good estimate says 20 micrograms will take
 45 about 100 years to kill you. If you take 1 pound, split it up 5 billion ways, 
 46 1 dose per person, you get 200 times less than that, so if nothing else 
 47 intervenes, it should kill everyone in about 20,000 years. I don't grseatly
 48 fear soething that will take 10 times as long as all recorded history to kill
 49 me. By comparison, that 20 micrograms, if it was say South American frog 
 50 poison, would kill in minutes. Cyanide at that level would kill a small child.
 51  
 52 On a lighter level, what do you think a "higher civilization" would do to us
 53 when we make contact, that is when they land here? Do you think they would
 54 greet us as equals 'welcome to the brotherhood of spacers', treat us like the
 55 ant at a picnic 'please pass the Raid', or perhaps put us in zoos, or keep us 
 56 as pets, or would they even know we are here?
 57 If I opt for the pet theory, it is because we, that is all human cultures,
 58 keep pets, so, maybe??, all thinking species do (other species sometimes seem
 59 to, also), and the qualities that make a good pet pretty well describe humans.

 71    So thi sis the future? Ah well. If someone would have told me 10 years ago 
 72 that I'd be sending message by computer over my telephone I would've just 
 73 stared at them because I was on medication at that time.
 74   I had the toughest time driving home tonight. I was driving down eigth and I
 75 had to get to 1st, and I was thinking "What side street do I need to take to
 76 get from 8th to 1st?" Then I remembered Einstein postulating that eventually 
 77 parralell lines meet. So I'm coming back on the Jersey Turnpike and my mom said
 78 "You missed the exit, back up!" I said "Mom, you don't back up on a Super high-
 79 way, there's three big lanes, more than enough to make a U-turn like you're
 80 supposed to." My car doesn't steer well anyway. I put a lock on the steering 
 81 wheel, but I lost the key. Now I can only drive in a straight line. And if I 
 82 want to make a turn I have to go partway into the intersection and turn off the
 83 lights and wait for someone to sideswipe me.
 84   I called the mechanic and said my car starts but it doesn't move. He saieck
 85 the trans. So I said to my brother "Take off the dress and help me with this
 86 thing!" I called this other mechanic and said "I was going down this really
 87 steep hill and I went to slam on the brakes and they didn't work." He said "It
 88 sounds like you lost a lot of fluid." I said, "Well, who wouldn't?"
 89    I took my cousin to the park. I go to the playground a lot to watch the kids
 90 jump up and down and scream, cause they don't know I'm using blanks. Well, it's
 91 good excercise anyway.
 92    He says "Push me on the swing!" so I push him and he says "Hard!" So I 
 93 push him again and he says "Give me a real push ya wimp!" So I back up 50 feet 
 94 and run. I push him and he says "Give me a REAL push, ya PANSY!" So I back up 
 95 the buick. He got out of the way, and so should I. 
 96    Thank you for beeing my friend.

123 Bard,  The system desn't specifically set to high or low intensity. So if
124 you can set your display to high intensity it should remain that way. 
125 If you can get it to echo <esc>[1m  where <esc> is the Ascii Escape code,
126 that will cause your display to go into bright mode if it responds to the
127 ansi codes. Alternately, set the display up the way you want it before yo
128 call BWMS. BWMS doesn't ever reset the screen, so any mode like that you set

140 18-SEP-1989 20:26 Actor Zimbalist testifies at PTL trial; IRS agent dismissed
141 By JUNE PRESTON
142    CHARLOTTE, N.C. (UPI) -- Actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr. testified Monday that the
143 PTL board he served on for five years was a rubber stamp for the wishes of
144 Bakker and other ministry leaders.
145    "It was called the board of directors but it did not function as a board
146 usually does, which is as a regulatory body," Zimbalist said. "It was a board o
147 affirmation only. I never assumed I was acting as a director of that
148 organization because the board didn't do that."
149    Late in the day the government presented another star witness, Bakker himsel
150 as most people knew him, on videotape offering the deal of a lifetime,
151 partnerships at PTL's Heritage Grand Hotel.
152    The partnerships are the heart and soul of the government's case against
153 Bakker, who is on trial on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He faces up to 12
154 years in prison if convicted of all charges.
155    Prosecutors say the television preacher fleeced his flock with a classic
156 pyramid scheme, taking in $158 million from people who typically gave him $1,00
157 apiece in return for a promise of three nights' lodging each year for at PTL's
158 South Carolina resort.
159    Bakker was silent as the first composite video rolled, a 1984 clip promoting
160 partnerships in PTL's Heritage Grand Hotel, which was then under construction.
161 He said God had given him a vision and the devil was battling to take it away.
162    "The devil tried to put a fever on me yesterday, but the Lord healed me and
163 now I'm feeling like a race horse, just raring to go," Bakker said on the tape.
164 "The devil's really mad about this, but I don't care -- I'm glad when the devil
165 gets mad."
166    Zimbalist, tanned and wearing glasses below a furrowed brow and a mane of
167 white hair, said he did not recall approving six-figure bonuses for Bakker, his
168 wife, Tammy Faye, and other ministry leaders.
169    The actor, who smiled broadly and winked at Bakker as he left the courtoom,
170 also joined other former board members intestifying he was not aware PTL was
171 drowning in red ink at the same time the Bakkers allegedly took millions in
172 bonuses.
173    "I assumed there was enough money at PTL," he said. "It was not an estate to
174 run itself at all, but if it had been completed, it could have run on its own.
175 The income of PTL was a very loose thing. Mr. Bakker was always able to go on
176 the air and plead for money. It was not a finite thing."
177    But Zimbalist, questioned by prosecutor Jerry Miller, played down the
178 government's allegations that Bakker oversold lifetime partnerships to PTL
179 supporters and misappropriated the proceeds.
180    "The funds may not have been spent as designated but I don't see it as the
181 great malfeasance you wish me to, Mr. Miller, because it was always possible to
182 raise more money," he said.
183    Zimbalist, who said he joined the board in January 1981 at Bakker's urging,
184 said he finally became aware of the ministry's financial troubles about five
185 years later when he recorded cassette tapes for PTL and the man who made the
186 tapes, a good friend, did not get paid.
187    "I recorded the Bible on cassettes," Zimbalist said. "These tapes were made
188 available to PTL as a money-raising tool. I didn't want any royalties and
189 wouldn't have accepted it anyway.
190    "There were several reasons why I left the board," he added. "One was becaus
191 the person producing these tapes was a close friend. Second, I was not at ease
192 as a board member. And third, a philosophical change took place in my life. I
193 began to move away from that area of religious practice, possibly because of
194 what I saw at PTL. I changed my feeling."
195    After attending a half-dozen meetings over a five-year period, Zimbalist, wh
196 gained fame portraying the lead character in the television series "The FBI,"
197 resigned from the board in January 1986.
198    The prosecution's attempt to call its next witness, IRS examiner Larry
199 Howlett, brought an objection from Bakker's lawyers, who said the government wa
200 attempting to bring details of a separate civil proceeding against Bakker into
201 the criminal trial.
202    In the civil case, heard as part of PTL's bankruptcy proceedings, now-retire
203 Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds imposed a $6.6 million judgment against the
204 Bakkers on grounds of excessive compensation and what he found to be Bakker's
205 mismanagement of the ministry.
206    Prosecutor Deborah Smith told U.S. District Judge Robert Potter the
207 government wanted to call Howlett to prove "that as early as 1982, Mr. Bakker
208 was warned repeatedly that with his excessive salaries, he endangered the
209 tax-exempt status of his ministry."
210    "He manipulated the board of directors by withholding financial information,
211 she continued. "He took excessive bonuses. The bankruptcy of PTL has certainly
212 been an issue in this case."
213    But Bakker co-counsel Harold Bender argued that the two matters should be
214 kept separate.
215    "I submit what (the prosecutors) are trying to do is much more prejudicial
216 than what they have done to date," Bender said. "They are trying to get on
217 evidence the tax matter. I ask that your honor not allow this into evidence."
218    Potter sustained the defense objection and dismissed Howlett as a witness.
219    Bakker's trial on 24 counts of fraud and cons
220 piracy has had several delays,
221 most notably when the evangelist was committed to a federal institution for a
222 psychiatric evaluation. He was found competent to continue.
223    If convicted on all charges, Bakker could receive prison terms totaling 120
224 years.
225

228 13-SEP-1989 22:43 Sex church files civil rights suit
229    LOS ANGELES (UPI) -- A couple convicted last week on prostitution charges
230 stemming from the sexual rituals at their church sued the police chief and city
231 attorney Wednesday, alleging their civil rights were violated.
232    Mary Ellen Tracy, who is known as Sabrina, high priestess of the Church of
233 the Most High Goddess, was convicted Friday of two counts of prostitution. She
234 and her husband, Will, the high priest, were both convicted of operating a hous
235 of prostitution.
236    The Canyon Country couple said their religion requires sexual rituals of its
237 members, who donated cash to the church.
238    The Tracys said an undercover police officer lied to gain admission and
239 instruction in the church's ritual, but refused to perform a "dedication" ritua
240 -- oral sex -- on Mary Ellen Tracy.
241    As soon as he left, eight police officers searched the church's Hollywood
242 rectory, seized their cash and records, punched them both and called Mary Ellen
243 "a whore," the Tracys said.
244    In their lawsuit against Police Chief Daryl Gates and City Attorney James
245 Hahn, Tracy said a search last April of the rectory, their treatment by the
246 police and their conviction on prostitution charges constituted the creation of
247 an official state religion in violation of their constitutional rights.
248    He said he would seek an order from U.S. District Judge William M. Byrne on
249 Monday allowing the church to operate exempt from state laws banning sex for
250 money.
251

253                         CONTAMINATED FOOD SERVED:-9/18/89
254     The investigative committee that watches over federal regulatory agencies 
255 will hear evidence on imported foods inspections, revealing contaminated foods 
256 were innocently eaten. Many got sick. Food and Drug Administration 
257 Commissioner Frank Young, still reeling from the generic drug attacks, blames 
258 the lack of inspections on lack of funds.
259     
260 FDA FAULTS EXAMINED:
261     Faulty procedures for reporting medical device failures have led to 
262 injuries, according to a federal investigative panel. Details will be heard by 
263 the Food and Drug Administration this fall. A possible cover-up between the 
264 FDA and Seimens Medical Systems Inc. will also be investigated. The firm makes 
265 an ultrasound machine that allegedly doesn't discover fetal deformaties.
266  
267 NO SUPPORT FOR INSPECTIONS:-9/18/8
268     Despite recognizing a need for better seafood inspection, the Bush 
269 administration told a House panel Friday it cannot support proposed 
270 legislation calling for mandatory, comprehensive inspections of fin fish and 
271 shellfish. Congress is considering three bills designed to initiate a 
272 mandatory seafood inspection program.
273     New proposals before Congress concerning seafood inspection include on-
274 call inspectors, increased routine monitoring of fish at processing plants, 
275 more testing of shellfish for chemical contamination and more federal efforts 
276 to curtail harvesting and distribution of shellfish from closed and 
277 contaminated waters, according to Friday reports.
278     At Friday's hearing by the House Health and Environment Subcommittee, 
279 officials of the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of 
280 Agriculture each said their respective agency is best to handle proposed 
281 seafood inspection programs. If such inspections become mandatory by law, 
282 Congress must decide which federal agency -the FDA or the Agriculture - should 
283 take on the task.
284     President George Bush, commenting to reporters in Spokane, said:  "Let them
285 eat cake -- I mean, imported fish.  We have more important things to do with
286 the taxpayers money, such as causing the prices of illegal drugs to rise to the
287 point that only we overly-rich Republicans will be able to afford crack." 
288                                                                                
289 COCAINE PRICES SOAR IN U.S.:-9/18/89
290     The U.S. cocaine capitals - Los Angeles and Miami - are reporting changes 
291 in the drug flow and price, threatening a rise in crime. Cocaine activity on 
292 the streets is declining in Miami, but steady in L.A. A kilo of cocaine in 
293 Miami has gone from $11,000 to $18,000 in eight weeks; in Los Angeles, it's 
294 jumped from $10,000 to as high as $23,000 in six months, officials say.
295     The more you snort, the more "they" make.  The wider the "drug war" expands
296 the more "they" make.  No wonder the United States government was dealing coke
297 to finance the Contras (and who knows what else).  Maybe there's a way out of
298 the federal deficit hole here.  Hire the Medellin cartel and Noriega's boys  
299 to work for the US treasury dept.  Solve a couple problems at once.  As Lee
300 Atwater, leader of the National Republican Committee said:  "We don't care, we
301 don't have to, we're Republicans."

304     Thirty-seven percent of 117 automotive fleet managers said Fords broke

313 B.A.D. - What is the source for your claims about Plutonium?  Do you really 
314 believe the Nuclear industry's "facts" and statistics about safety and the
315 toxicity of Nuclear matter?  Don't you feel their credibility is somewhat
316 questionable in light of all that has happend in the history of Nuclear 
317 development in this country?  The point of the fuss over Galileo is:  "Why
318 take such a risk?"  If it was anything else, you would no doubt agree that
319 1 in 2500 or 1 in 25 odds of a catastrophic explosion in the Shuttle is not
320 worth the risk.  But then you probably feel a nuclear power plant, or 
321 radioactice waste dump site should be built in your backyard?  Why not launch
322 Galileo with a more dependable missle?  Why not re-think your technical hubris?
323 Plutonium IS the most toxic substance on earth.  The minutest quantity inhaled,
324 or on your skin will kill you.  In a long, agonizing, terrible death.  Is that
325 what you wish for all of the people on the earth if there is an accident?

377 ................................................................
378 I get my data on plutonium from the truly huge data base of facts that exist
379 on the subject. (There is also a almost as large base of junk, too.) The 
380 specific dose mentioned 20 micrograms, was in reference to a list in an article
381 (it's been sevral years, so I can't say now in which magazine) listing some of
382 the deadlier poisons. About 20 of them are believed to be fatal to 50% of
383 average humans with a dose of less than 20 mikes (not cistop mikes). Pu is
384 certainly not one of them. The hazard of radioactive substances is inversely
385 proportional to the half life, as the things with shorter half lives give off
386 more radiation in a shorter period of time. Pu does concentrate in the bones,
387 which makes it slightly more dangerous than say rdioactive sodium, which 
388 collest mainly in muscle. If muscle dies, you just replace it, but when bone
389 marrow dies, you lose red blood cells ( and white cells, too, tho less). In 
390 Either case, radaition deaths are about propotional to dosage if the dose is
391 lower than the 'clinical dose' that causes immediate sickness. Radium, for 
392 example is far more dangerous because its shorter half life causes it to emit
393 radiation faster. Pu on the skin is essentially harmless, it washes right off.
394 As for the question 'why not launch Galileo on a safer missile?', there is no
395 safer missile, but in any case the risk to human life is immeasurably small.
396 By the way, where do you get your so called facts? Many nuclear uses are
397 military, which can afford accurate measurements, which have been made. The
398 early tests are long since in the public domain. On the other hand, most food
399 hazards are unmeasured. However, we do know that mustard, horseradish, and
400 common black pepper are carcinogenic. As well as peanuts. Or, in fact just
401 about anything that has been carefully enough tested. Very few things have 
402 been. No money in it, and no potential for military uses, either. As for
403 our rapidly poinsoning ourselves, it is obvious we are, just look at how long
404 poeple live: late Roman times, about 29 years average, civil war times, about
405 49 years, now, due to the poisons, only about 79 years. thanks, but I'll take
406 the food additives that prevent decay (and thus food poisoning).
407 Though, I suppose you might qualify as one who takes no risks unnecesarily,
408 so if you don't smoke, drink, eat peanuts, or drive a car, burn wood for heat,
409 or do anything else dangerous go ahead and throw the first stone. By the way,
410 I am concerned by the unnecessary risk you pose to me if you drive and smoke,
411 the combination is much more dangerous to your fellow persons than NASA'a
412 most deadly stunt.

509               COURT FAVORS EXXON:-9/8/89
510     The U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska denied 
511 Thursday petitions for discovery filed by private plaintiffs 
512 regarding the inadvertent erasure of some backup computer 
513 tapes relating to the Valdez oil spill, Exxon Co. said. The 
514 decision was in favor of Exxon, which has said from the 
515 beginning that the tapes were never designed to retain 
516 documents.
517     Exxon Corp. abruptly halted its program to rescue wildlife 
518 from the Alaska oil spill, angering U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
519 officials and environmentalists who said the migratory bird 
520 season is just beginning. Exxon - responsible for the March 
521 spill, the USA's worst - previously said it would halt spill 
522 cleanup operations Sept. 15. The toll so far: 34,044 dead 
523 birds and 993 sea otters. APn  09/13/89 By RITA BEAMISH 
524 Associated Press Writer
525    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Dan Quayle and 
526 Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner will visit Alaska next 
527 week to check on progress being made in cleaning up the Exxon 
528 oil spill as the company gears down its efforts for the 
529 winter, officials said Wednesday.
530    The visit, coming as Quayle heads to Asia for 12 days, is 
531 intended to refocus attention on the nation's worst oil spill. 
532 A grounded Exxon tanker last March dumped 11 million gallons 
533 of oil along the state's shoreline.
534    Quayle will be "briefed on the situation up there. We hope 
535 to meet with some concerned citizens," as well as Coast Guard 
536 and state officials during the 2 1/2 hour stopover at 
537 Elmendorf Air Force Base, said the vice president's press 
538 secretary, David Beckwith. He said that it was undecided 
539 whether Quayle would meet with Exxon officials, but that he 
540 was "extremely interested in the company's views."
541    Exxon has disagreed with state and federal officials 
542 throughout the course of the clean-up on the adequacy of the 
543 company's efforts.
544    "There's still a good deal of uncertainty about the future 
545 of the clean-up program. We hope there's less uncertainty 
546 after we leave," said Beckwith.
547    The Alaskan stop as Quayle flies to Korea, Japan, the 
548 Philippines and Malaysia.
549    President Bush had hoped to visit Alaska as part of a 
550 western swing early next week, but the White House scrapped 
551 those plans.
552    Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday that 
553 Bush's September travel schedule was too busy, and that the 
554 Alaskan weather turns too inclement to schedule the trip 
555 before next spring.
556    However, other sources who requested anonymity had said 
557 earlier that administration officials convinced Bush it would 
558 not be politically beneficial to refocus attention on the 
559 spill, after initial criticism that he took too long to get 
560 the federal government involved in the clean-up.
561    Asked about the administration position on the amount of 
562 oil still not cleaned up, Fitzwater said "I don't think we can 
563 characterize that situation. We're running into bad weather up 
564 there and we'll have to see how things look in the fall in 
565 terms of the spill clean-up."
566    Quayle and Skinner, who will not be going on the rest of 
567 Quayle's trip, will receive briefings from the clean-up 
568 coordinator, Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, and others 
569 on the progress of cleaning up the March 24 spill from the 
570 Exxon Valdez tanker.
571    The Monday visit comes a week after an announcement by 
572 Alaska state officials that they will continue the clean-up on 
573 a limited scale when Exxon pulls out the last of its work 
574 crews Friday from the fouled coastline of Prince William Sound 
575 and the Gulf of Alaska.
576    A spokesman for Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said details of 
577 the state's follow up were being worked out but that the 
578 governor and state Department of Environmental Conservation 
579 were expected to agree on a light, manual clean-up effort, 
580 plus research and development during the dark and stormy 
581 winter months.
582    The state is interested in various clean-up technques that 
583 inventers have proposed from coastal towns tainted by the spill.
584    The governor's office said the state would expect Exxon to 
585 pay for any clean-up costs it incurred.
586    Exxon estimates its expenses for the summer clean-up at 
587 more than $1.2 billion.
588 ALCOHOL POLICY SET FOR OIL CREW:-9/14/89
589     Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. in Anchorage, Alaska, refused 
590 16 crew members aboard vessels who had higher blood alcohol 
591 levels than .04, the U.S. Coast Guard's highest level for 
592 operating a commercial vessel. The firm set up the policy June 
593 1 because of the March 24 Valdez oil spill. The USS Valdez 
594 captain was proven to be intoxicated during the accident. BUSH 
595 ALASKAN TRIP CANCELED:-9/20/89
596     President Bush was scheduled to visit the Alaskan Prince 
597 William Sound where the Exxon Valdez spilled Sept. 18, but his 
598 trip was indefinitely canceled Exxon stopped its cleanup Sept. 
599 15 because of winter. Many environmentalist believe that the 
600 job could have been done on a limited basis. Laws and lawsuits 
601 are pending to insure Exxon finishes the cleanup. EXXON 
602 TESTING ALASKAN WELL:-9/20/89
603     Exxon plans to drill a $30 million test well at Point 
604 Thompson in the Alaskan artic to help determine the size of 
605 the well. The tract near Kaktovik, Alaska, might contain 300 
606 million barrels of gas liquids and 5 trillion cubic feet of 
607 natural gas.

743                  WASHINGTON (SEPT. 22/89) UPI -  The administration 
744 acknowledged Friday that it lured a suspected narcotics dealer 
745 to a park across from the White House so that it could buy 
746 President Bush a cocaine prop for his televised  anti-drug 
747 speech. 
748    White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the 
749 undercover "drug sting" operation by the Drug Enforcement 
750 Administration dramatized Bush's statement that drugs are 
751 being sold virtually everywhere.  
752    "We went to the DEA and asked them if they would do a sting 
753 in front of the White House to show how easy it was," 
754 Fitzwater said in confirming a report first carried by The 
755 Washington Post.  
756    Disclosure of the orchestrated drug purchase, in which 
757 there were no arrests, drew criticism from Capitol Hill and 
758 the American Civil  Liberities Union.  
759    Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said the suspected pusher, a 
760 teenager who  initially complained he didn't even know where 
761 the White House was, had  been drawn to nearby Lafayette 
762 Square for a "photo opportunity."  
763    "Is this a drug war or is this only theatrics?" Breaux 
764 asked. "Is the administration really serious in fighting drugs 
765 with DEA agents, or with speechwriters?"  
766  
767                                               
768    Colleen O'Connor, an ACLU director in New York City, said, 
769 "This is another example of the false P.R. tactics that this 
770 administration and the previous one are so fond of." She also 
771 said, "The purpose of the DEA is to catch drug dealers, not to 
772 obtain props for speeches."  
773                                                     
774  
775    Bush, in his nationally televised anti-drug speech on Sept. 
776 5, announced his new war on narcotics and held up a plastic 
777 bag of crack cocaine that agents claim to have purchased from 
778 the suspected dealer.  
779    "This is crack cocaine," Bush said, adding it was "seized a 
780 few days ago in a park across the street from the White 
781 House."  
782    In making the purchase, which was not a seizure, the agents 
783 set up what appears to be the agency's first undercover crack 
784 buy in Lafayette Square, the Post said, quoting officials 
785 familiar with the case.  
786    DEA spokesman William Alden maintained, however, that there 
787 had been earlier drug-investigations in the park, situated 
788 across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, and said it 
789 is routine for undercover agents to select sites for drug 
790 buys.  
791    He also confirmed that when first contacted by an 
792 undercover DEA agent posing as a buyer, the teenage suspect 
793 asked the whereabouts of the White House.  
794    "Where the (expletive) is the White House," the teenager 
795 said in a conversation secretly taped by the DEA, Alden said.  
796    Alden said that the teenager had been the target of a 
797 three-month investigation and had sold crack to agents on 
798 three previous occasions in other parts of the city.  
799    He also said that undercover agents had been in 
800 "negotiations with him for a much bigger buy." But now, 
801 because of the publicity, efforts to build a bigger case have 
802 stopped and the agency plans to arrest the  suspect soon.  
803                                                       
804    O'Connor was unsympathetic to the DEA's plight. She said, 
805 "They shouldn't be creating situations that are newsworthy in 
806 themselves ... a political scam."  
807                                                          
808  
809    The idea of the cocaine prop first surfaced this August at 
810 Bush's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. White House 
811 communications director David Demarest asked Cabinet Affairs 
812 Secretary David Bates to contact the Justice Department about 
813 getting the drugs for Bush's speech.  
814    The Justice Department was told to find crack that fit the 
815 description in the speech, but not to go out and arrest 
816 someone just for the speech, administration aides told the 
817 Post.  
818    Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select 
819 Committee on Narcotics Control and Abuse, and a frequent 
820 critic of White House  drug-fighting efforts, seemed unmoved 
821 by this case.  
822    "Since it was a legal bust ... he doesn't feel particularly 
823 disturbed if this is the way the president wants to make his 
824 point," a spokesman said.  
825                                                          
826                 
827    Breaux complained, however, the entire matter was 
828 unnecessary. He said, "The problem is so bad, reality speaks 
829 much louder than staged events."
830  
831                                                                      
832 Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee, commented,
833 as he ordered another shot of whiskey, "You have to remember we're 
834 Republicans, we don't deal with reality, we deal in drugs."               
835

867 Well, then, in THAT case...
868  
871      The Cloaked Man watched his victim tumbling down the hillside to the 
872 hard stone below.  Smiling, he placed the rod that he had carried back into 
873 his pack, and then palmed the thin, hazy line... the weapon that he had used
874 against his adversary.
875      Standing at the crest of the hill, the Cloaked Man could not help a slight
876 feeling of satisfaction that crept into his very being.  Now, here, after all
877 his years of chasing this being across the very universe,
878 the trail had finally led him to his goal.  He had located the Friar.
879 At last, at long last, the end of his Great Trial had begunm and his mission
880 could finally be put to rest.
881      A small band around the Cloaked Man's thin wrist beeped quietly.  Without
882 contemplating his actions in the slightest, the Cloaked Man pointed the hazy
883 rod at the place where the Friar had been standing and pulled the trigger.
884 That done, he placed the line into a holster at his side.
885      Out of the corner of a silver eye, he noticed that his victim was 
886 just beginning to stir.  The Cloaked Man's smile vanished, and he darted 
887 behind a large boulder that stood at the center of the top of the hill.
888 His confidence wavered momentarily.  He had caught this being by surprise when
889 he had first appeared to him, allowing  him an easy target.  But his Mentors 
890 had shown him the horror that this Friar had created, the stark destruction,
891 and now this terrible scourge of life itself was to face him.  He looked down 
892 at his holster.  A bead of white light was moving slowly upwards on a graph, 
893 and had reached the halfway point.
894      The Cloaked Man cursed, realizing  that his weapon had not yet fully
895 recharged.  He glanced up at the horizon and saw the Stone Triangle pulsating 
896 in the moonlight, as surely the dampher on his power generator as he was that
897 Friar was the one he sought.
898      The Cloaked Man eased out from behind the boulder cautiously, and peered
899 at the place where the Friar had come to rest.
900       His victim was still there, mst   certainly.  But his motions were
901 concealed, both by the angle of vision  and by the green fog that filtered 
902 across the ground.
903      The Cloaked Man reached into his   pack and removed a long, silver dagger
904 that glimmered in the ample light of the three moons.  If he couldn't use
905 the cutting edge of technology here, he could still use a cutting edge.
906      Friar turned, suddenly,gripping   some object and holding it aloft.
907      The Cloaked Ma gasped, his dagger falling from his trembling hands to
908 the ground.  "The Quantier...!" he whispered.  "How can he...?"  He steeled
909 himself.  With bitter determination, he strode down the hill.  "Now
910 close the paradox." he whispered.

978 I looked at the goblet, then I was distracted by a glint of light from
979 the hillside.  It was a person coming down the side of the hill, with
980 a dagger in his hand.  At that moment, he saw the goblet, and stopped
981 cold.
982 I thought it might be his, and motioned to him with it.  An intense fire
983 bolt leapt from the bowl of the cup in the direction I was pointing it.
984  
985 Foooooom!!!!!
986  
987 A tree to the left of the man (?) exploded in flames, and he stopped and
988 dropped to the ground.  I saw him look at an object attached to his belt
989 and curse roundly. 
990 I was somewhat startled, having meant the man no harm.  Then a thought 
991 occured to me, maybe he was the man who had hit me on the head and 
992 shoved me off of the cliff.  Was that him?
993  
994 "Who are you?" I shouted, pointing the bowl of the strange goblet towards
995 the side of the hill above his head.  "What do you want?"  I tried to act
996 menacing, but I really didn't know how to operate the goblet, if it was
997 indeed a weapon.
998 Then another thought.  What had become of the woman I followed???
