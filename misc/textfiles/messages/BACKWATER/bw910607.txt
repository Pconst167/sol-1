 30 Personally I'm a wee bit tired of seeing the research and evaluation department
 31@getting put down here all the time.  Reminds me to much of the old story about
 32@the fate off all messangers of bad news.  Evaluation exists as a method 
 33@independent of both curiculam and teachers
 34  
 35 put down all the time here.  Yes, we do have a good deal of computing resources
 36 , but we got them by being very frugal in our purchasing.  As I said on the
 37 last disk, we stopped buying IBM as soon as there was an alternative (And I 
 38 might add that it took some work to get this approved.)  These clones were
 39 of better quality, and as much as 1/3 the price of actuall IBM's.  This 
 40 practice of maximizing our resources with the funds alloted.  We use almost
 41 all of the power we have.  We have 4 near secretaries(They do many different
 42 things, only two qualify as normal secretaries.)  in a department of around
 43 25 people.  That ain't a high ration.  We can do this because we make good
 44 use of our resources.  
 45  
 46 It is very annoying to be constantly flamed when you know you are working
 47 your a*s off, doing your best to get the best value for the dollar, and t
 48 o make all the work you do meaningfull and usefull to the district as a 
 49 whole.  I've been working with these people for going on three years now,
 50 and it really hurts to see them put down all the time.

 60 I must agree with A.D. I have seen many departments where the computer power
 61 went to waste. Not in the Research and Evaluation Department. They had so
 62 much knowledge about computers they re-wrote the school district book on
 63 what could and couldn't be purchased. Pity poor DP when the knowledge
 64 base started moving up a couple floors! You can complain about ineffective
 65 use of computers in the district all you want, but you can't say it about
 66 the eval dept and be taken seriously.

 70 Well, at first I was dissaponted with the end of TP.  Then I realized 
 71 something.  The ending we saw was the ending they filmed in case the
 72 show got cancelled.  If the show continues in one form or another, I
 73 suspect we will find that the last five minutes or so were all a dream

 82 From the Beuro of Nosey Questions, World Watch Three>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>wwiii
 83 Hello, Phoenix here.  I just used the US command to see if any of my old aliass
 84 still exsisted.  I found it interesting to see howmany people log on once, then
 85 never again.  Another interesting point is that the records go back to the mid 
 86 80's.  In this search I ran across names of useres past.  People in this elec-
 87 tronic community that are with us no more.  One name ran across the screen that
 88 stuck out (probably 'cos it was all caps...), that of one Brittania Scarbrough.
 89 .
 90 I found it interesting, as I was reminded of her recently on another board.  
 91 Some one mentioned my REAL name, this person said this in a post to someone nam
 92 ed Justin.  So, could anyone tell me what Brit and Justin are up to these days 
 93 and are they in the area?
 94 .
 95 One final bit (byte?);  If you read this, why don't you drop a line saying how 
 96 long you've been staying at the Inn.  My first visit was eons ago, 84 or 85 i 
 97 think.  I've been off and on ever since (more off than on, I'm afraid).  Whenev
 98 er I can get to a modem, this is the first place I stop.  All4now.  Phoenix.

227 L'homme, yes its more or less dead.  I think the chances of a wrap up movie
228 are somewhat decent though.
229  
230 The more I think about it, the easier it becomes to take.  They had sunk so 
231 low (In my opinion) as to have cooper foolishly give in to his darkside,
232 when there was every indication that he had learned his lesson already, and
233 that he would when faced with he challange make the right choice.  The 
234 thought of watching CooBer kill people and make asses of people through the
235 first seven or so episodes of the now canceled 3rd season just makes me
236 sick.
237  
238 I know that I'm sounding a lot like the many dweebs that criticize the show,
239 but I really do feel cheated.  They let me down, and not for the first time.
240 In time I've been able to forgive them in the past (Either what they did
241 made a disturbing sort of sense, or I waited it out and eventually it got 
242 resolved.)  But I really suspect that this was the last straw.  Even if the
243 show had come back, I don't think I'd have been watching.
244  
245 As of now I watch NO TV nothing.  I don't even care to deal with the uneven
246 quality of STTNG anymore.  I never seem to remember the Simpsons (1 half 
247 hour show a week is easily forgotten).
248  
249 Thought extreme, I'm not alone in my view.  Most of the people I know
250 have been in a steady downward spiral of TV viewing for several years.  I
251 don't doubt that most of them will bottom out at absolute 0 as I have.  These
252 are inteligent, well educated people.  Not all of them in the Computing field
253 either.  What the H*ll has happaned?  Even cable doesn't draw me anymore.
254 Its expensive, and all it is is the same old stuff over and over again.  
255 Guligans Island was a classic, but how many times can you watch it before
256 memorizing the half dozen plots they repeated over and over again.
257  
258 Oh well, enough of my rant for now.  Maybe its good that I don't watch any
259 more TV.  But a little bit of me worries that this is just another sign
260 of the steadily increasing alianation of the Haves and the Have nots, the
261 educated and the illiterate(Hope I spelled that right. :-), and the future
262 and the past.

278 AD: I know your frustration with TV. I agree with most of it. I like cable
279 because I get to see the many movies that I never get to see in the theater. I
280 used to go out to 2-3 movies a week. When another who is no longer among the
281 BW-us used to work at the Eastgate, I saw movies there all the time. Once
282 again, social entropy takes its toll. I think I have only seen 2 or 3 movies
283 in a theater this year. If it weren't for cable, I would be totally out of
284 touch with the movies being made. I also enjoy watching older films, either
285 seeing them again or for the first time. As far as network TV goes, I watch(ed)
286 TP, STTNG, Late Night (I still get a laugh!) and occasionally The Tonight
287 Show. Quantum Leap is pretty good, but it hasn't been on in awhile (at least
288 not that I have seen). I don't get a paper so I don't get the TV listings. I
289 find myself listening to more and more music. I just bought a new car stereo
290 with a CD player and I haven't even tuned any PDX stations in yet. sigh...
291 We are becoming pop-culture hermits, at least as far as television goes :-)
292 A disappointing thing about life and growing up and old. We have less and
293 less time to do the things that we really enjoy. Maybe I am being too
294 presumptuous: The "we" should be "I". I don't get as many chances to simply
295 enjoy things as much as I used to. Life can be like a vicious cycle, consuming
296 more and more time and energy for the task of getting to the next level
297 of consumption. Oh oh, philosophy alert. Better hang it up for now...

378 Astral Dreamer:  *Twin Peaks* withdrawal shouldn't be too rough on you.  
379 ACCESS (tm) GUIDES just did a TP guide  book with some data on what we saw in
380 the season finale (and I do mean finale) and Pocket has committed to doing
381 more 'literature' in the future by at   least four more books/diaries/whatever.
382 And there's always the bubble-gum cards if you're really hard-up for it... :)
383  
384 On another note, what does everyone     think of the singular BEST and WORST
385 film of the summer, *Terminator 2:      Judgement Day*?
386  
387 *****Paradoxes*****... -Grrrrrr!-       Perhaps someone should go back in time
388 to prevent Cameron from writing the     ening to T2 the way he did.
389  
390 Still, all is not lost for those        die-hard 'Doom & Gloom' types such as
391 myself who actually LIKED the idea of  the timeline staying the way it is.
392 All SKYNET has to do is send another    T-1000 back to take the placeof the  
393 now-dead professor, who suddenly won't  NEED the Terminator parts to build     
394 the supercomputer.
395  
396 I think it would be most interesting if it turned out that the T-1000 didn't
397 die, after all.  Once it cools, it      could end up being the driving force   
398 that makes sure SKYNET comes to life.   In fact, it might even turn out that   
399 T-1000 is the actual sentience that     BECOMES SKYNET eventually.
400  
401 It'd be a twist, I think.

429 Geesh, WILL IT **EVER** end???? Is it even POSSIBLE we'll now have new and 
430 additional witch hunts at PPS?  The morning paper seems to indicate the Sch
431 Board NOW wats to go after all those "undesirable/unit" PPS teachers.  Wonder
432 if they'll use Eval. Dept. "records -- the ones PAT stated on cable (with 
433 Mr. Rieke present) ABSOLUTELY COULDN'T be used for making those kinds of
434 decisions -- or whether they'll just turn the entire district over to 
435 free-for-all gang warfare, with administrators v teachers/teachers v 
436 teachers/parents v teachers, administrations, schools/parents v parents/
437 schools v school/dists. v dists/dists v state, etc.  We can only hope PAT
438 isn't as depraved as the classified staff's union seemed to be.
439  
440 In "reality" (in any really exists), this sounds like just another Board
441 attempt to glaze over NOT ONLY 1) taxpayer reaction to the recent insulting
442 statements by certain administrators (we're all idiots, you know) that 
443 current reports criticizing their performance wa actually praising them 
444 because a) not only were they already doing what was recommended but that
445 b) it was all they COULD do within state guidelines BUT 2) the already 
446 long-standing administrative problems that have plagued tis "monster boy"
447 police state originally set up previous to Dr. Prophet's arrival (with the 
448 help of such long-time Board members as "to-be-"elected"-this-evening"

450 has a "school" named after her, related or WHAT???]  and designed to keep
451 employees and the public in a state of perpetual mystification.  Like this
452 city really needs MORE war zones ... and students ADDITIONAL role models 
453 for gang warfare.
454  
455 And it's funny ... I don't recall "reports" of the report issued by the
456 PPS-appointed/(paid?) Stife Commitee stating there WAS a problems with
457 district TEACHERS.  They did, however, cite problems with central
458 administration.  So why isn't THAT problem resolved before teacher witch 
459 hunts are instituted?  Now *I* happen to tink (although I prefer to bypass
460 the brain whenever possible) that 
461  
462 1) IF teachers had administrators who ENCOURAGED them to work together
463    rather than isolating them in fraagmented/alientated groups/gangs; AND
464  
465 2) If teachers had adminstrators that didn't perpetuate

467     a) the use of mandated ILLOGICAL/IRRATIONAL ... <-- I know, I know 
468        ... these terms refer strictly to hysterical women (worse terms
469        if you happen to be middle-aged) **NOT** wealthy white males; OR
470  
471    b) the unfair, inconsistent management tactics designed to conceal 
472       the real causes of te resulting messes from the confused chaos
473       necessitated by the need for persistent mystification to maintain
474      "order"
475  
476 the ENTIRE STAFF might be able to function better and might actually
477 find they LIKE each other!
478  
479 But since school is out for the summer and the Board will probably also
480 take a couple of months off, why don't we all get some activist practice
481 by participating in the investigation/scrutinization of tese same sorts 
482 of tactics being used by the "monster boy mafias/networked Athenahoods" 
483 at the City of Portland who will, if you have enough money or prove other-
484 wise useful, will gladly start/maintain for long periods a civil war and
485 victimize the "chosen" from in your neighborhood (and TRY to get a lawyer
486 if your "chosen and aren't a billionaire ... an eye-opening experience,
487 let me warn you) ... just ANOTHER group we "pay" to abuse us to we can,
488 i frustration then ager, turn in around to self-abuse then abuse of others
489 ... generally anyone weaker, sicker, poorer, lowlier or more undesirable/
490 unfit bur primarily women/wifes/full-time-working-mothers/slaves (who
491 traditionally work insanely hard in hectic environments, earn shamefully
492 littlen then retreat to tiny "castles" for the evening to another
493 full-time underrated/unappreciated job), CHILDREN, and the handicapped
494 and elderly.
495  
496 But if that's not enough abuse, may you ca arrange to PAY your union 
497 (like I was requied to do) to blatantly harrass and humiliate you.  A
498 good summer project for PPS teachers, in all that spare time too many
499 bureaucrats think is unnecessary and SOME misinformed taxpayers also
500 seem to resent, might be to find all the loopholes in your contract before
501 a new, possibly even WORSE one is signed in the fall ... if it's anything
502 likek the old classified staff's contract it's been PACKED with
503 madeningly insulting, blairing betrayals.
504  
505 Overall, I think the questions we need to be asking ouselves now is how 
506 much more "control" over our quality of life we are willing to confer to
507 these gangster grops and how much more insultingly abuse we are going to
508 allow them to get???  If things don't start improving shortly, who knows,
509 maybe some time soon our young street gangsters/gansterettes will finally
510 deduce how ridiculous it is to be taking their frustrations out on each
511 other (and anybody forced to reside in those already deliberately mained
512 neighborhoods) and stat targeting the REAL troublemakers.  I'm afraid the
513 bread and circus brainwash can't maintain this insanity too much longer;
514 the "bread" is runing and andn slave labor is tiring of the zoo reality/
515 mentality.

519  Whaddya expect from a country that spends more of the taxpayer's hard
520 earned dollars on its military than on its system of public education?
521 While we're so worried about the rising price of oil and the affairs of
522 the Middle East, we've completely forgotten that it is the intelligence 
523 of our people that gives us an edge over other nations.  Yankee know-how
524 has become completely forgotten.  For the first time in the history of this
525 nation, a generation isn't going to exceed its predecessors in intellect.
526 I find that rather disturbing.  The war in the gulf proved that ultra-tech
527 is militarily viable.  However, no matter how much we spend on the
528 military, we'll still lose the ultratech edge if we haven't t know-wot
529 to improve it over that of our adversaries.
530    I suppose, though, that this problem is not just the government's
531 fault.  I guess a lot of it has to do with the allready high level of
532 technical advancement in this country.  We no longer truly value 
533 intellect for its own sake.  From my personal observations, people today
534 don't want to expend the effort to learn.  Americans feel that it isn't
535 important for them to know how things work, just what buttons to press
536 in order to get it to work.  I am just glad I'm not one of them.  I
537 believe that knowledge is power.  If I know why and how something works,
538 it gives me an advantage over those who don't and don't feel any 
539 inclination to learn.  This is why I respect, though I *DON'T* approve,
540 of hackers, crackers, virus writers, and fone phreaks.  They, at least,
541 have the drive to learn, and to put their knowledge to a use (albeit
542 a distasteful and wasteful one).  This puts them at a plave above the
543 common chattel that they victimize, and who haven't the intellect to
544 stop them.  It is true that your average anarchist is more intelligent
545 than your average John Q. Public.
546  I ramble though.  I also seriously doubt that anyone here even read what
547 I just wrote, but I needed to write it for my own sake, not the reader's.

552 Kurfur, I read what you said.
553  
554 On the subject of evaluation department records being used to evaluate 
555 teachers.  That would be a bad thing.  A very bad thing.  (Note this is all
556 my opinion, and should not be in anyway taken to have anything to do with
557 anybody who has real power, which I most certainly do NOT.  Heck, I don't
558 even really know whats going on directly.)
559  
560 High stakes testing (Which is what evaluationg teachers through test
561 performance.)  Is a bad thing.  It makes them hostile towards the test,
562 encourages them to teach to the test, and thus undermines greatly the 
563 usefullness of the test.
564  
565 Please note that in the past, it has been district policy not to do this
566 sort of thing (Note however that I have heard rumours of it going on. )
567  
568 The biggest failing of the Research and Evaluation departments of PPS in 
569 my opinion has been our inability to educate people as to the proper use
570 of our data.  Teachers are not required to take even one class on test
571 theory before getting their certificate in this state (And don't they
572 spend a good deal of time creating and giving their own tests?)  Many
573 administrators have the same problem.  This leads to abuse and 
574 misunderstanding.

608 of those who voted to fire Dr. Blanchard who died shortly thereafter but who
609 left the person they knew damn well RAN the district there (a move made just

611 they renovate it for the school district offices.  Administrative offices are
612 scattered all around the city and there's currently little or very inconven-

778 Good to see it back.  Seems to me that I havn't babled on here for awhile.
779  
780 Hard to think of things to talk about.  I think that may be one of our
781 biggest problems in this day and age.  We are all so used to being 
782 overwhelmed by the media machine, that we have problems forming long
783 lasting relationships.  
784  
785 What I mean by this, is that the media provides us with tons of input.   
786 Ignoring for a moment the quality of this input,  lets consider the 
787 implications this has.  We are used to being able to turn on the
788 TV, or the radio, or go to the movies.  There we are entertained.  It
789 seems safe to assume that the quality of the entertainment provided 
790 must atleast be tolerable, since we keep going back.  Now, how many
791 people are there keeping this media machine going?  Hundreds of 
792 thousends atleast.  
793  
794 So, what does this have to do with relationships?  (Relationships
795 is defined here as meaning human interaction, in case anybody is
796 confused.)  Have you ever noticed that the longer you have known 
797 a person, the less you have to say to them?  Until you meet maybe
798 two or three times a year, say hello, chat for an hour or so, and 
799 go your seperate ways?  You may have been the best of friends,
800 yet you hardly ever see each other.  Why?  I believe it is because
801 we interact for the most part to entertain, or be entertained.
802  
803 Cynical?  Perhaps.  Given time, even the best of stories can become
804 boring.  And the interactive stories that we right as our lives are
805 I believe no different.  Why should they be.  All is human experiance.
806 Perhaps this is what Shakespere meant when he said "All the world is
807 a stage..."  (Gosh, I hope it was Shakespere.)
808  
809 And so we run franticly from character to character, trying desperatly 
810 to gain the perfect role, to play the perfect part, to be the central
811 player.  We all live with our own tradgadies, comodys and adventures.
812 But is the play the true meaning?  I think not.
813  
814 I believe that it is the play that distracts us.  Draws us in, and
815 all to ofteen, destroys us.  The roles we choose for ourselves are
816 to ofteen overly constrained, and without usefull purpose.  It is
817 not unusual for the simple formation of a goal to strive for to 
818 be beyond us.  And even when the goal is invisioned, it is seldom
819 atained.
820  
821 Why then do we play the game?  Is it because we must?  Are we all part
822 of some cosmic machine?  Biological parts in a rather simplistic and
823 stuborn Neural Net?  Are we meerly part of some huge soap opera, 
824 conceived of and set in motion by creatures we could not begin to 
825 comprehend?  
826  
827 I do not believe it matters.  If we must play the game, then let us
828 choose for ourselves roles which are not standard.  Let us find ways
829 to play between the rules, and make our own.  Let us know that we have
830 lived, and in living shaped the landscape around us in a positive way.
831  
832 And, perhaps by being different, by creating, we will not loose each
833 other.

840 Is anybody else screaming about the raised sewer charges and the new fascist
841 stream cleanup program that those raised charges will support?  They have
842 grants for Fanno and Johnson Creeks where the wealthy can have the city come
843 in and place beautiful large rocks and probably "native plants" and place
844 park benches in their probably fenced in yards.  Then they're gonna required
845 the rest of creek residents to do the same ... on their own money (not the
846 plants or benches, of course).  
847  
848 Then they're going to encourge neighbors to rat on each other if they don't
849 feel the creek is being maintained well enough.  THey'll probably start
850 giving "tickets" (like the OLCC) and then the wealthy will sue the less wealthy
851 for damage to what the city did for them free by those whohave neither the
852 time nor money to "redo" their creek area into something out of some fancy
853 garden architectural magazine.  
854  
855  
856 Paranoid, you say?  You bet!!! I've been through it with the city and

869 Huh.  Maybe I can be the first to report a crime in this regard.  THe city
870 has NEVER maintained the creek area in the right away, even after they 
871 insisted I donate 150
872 feet of my front yard  to construct a ditch in my creek beek 150' long,
873 6-8feet deep, and 15' across ... for which I am now liable.  This was done
874 to drain a 40-house development not even on the creek.  And for this, I
875 got absolutely no compensation (the deed-holder was a lawyer and the ex-
876 developer an ex-professional football player).

894 This sewer/storm drain issue IS interesting.  When Earl Blumenauer's
895 department repaved part of Barbur Blvd. near the AM/PM market, they
896 completely remove the storm drain ... paved right over it.  And in the
897 eyesore they've created across the street from it, there was whole stacks
898 of old drains.  Seemed like a deliberate attempt to create problems for 
899 the neighborhood who had to deal with that water that had nowhere to go.
900 A huge lack was created for a year at the north corner of the AM/PM block
901 and they finally came and took care of that problem.  I think they just
902 resloped the road so the water would stay on the street and continue on
903 downhill.  I wonder if they filled it the ditch, too.  I'll have to check
904 tomorrow.
905  
906 And it seems funny they're just NOW posting warning signs about sewage
907 going into the Willamette from downtown ... I'm sure they wouldn't be
908 doing that if they HADN'T of gotten the rate hike.   I thought these
909 kinds of projects used to be taken up under local improvement districts.
910 Just having fuzzy notions of such things, it would seem to me that the
911 downtown merchants of the APP should have been charged for this.  But of
912 course they have their own rate system down there.

919 I'd notice some time back First Baptist Church & Country Club, Inc.
920 has removed the benches that were placed on SW 12th and the other
921 street running by the library (sorry, don't know the sequence of 
922 downtown streets) in memory of my father and paid for by my mother.
923 I thought they'd been taken in for repair but when I called the other
924 day they stated outright they were removed so the homeless wouldn't sit 
925 there.  I asked in you had to be of a certain income level to sit on a
926 church bench and she said they were actually SLEEPING there and defacated
927 and urinated and stuff.  I inquired if they possibly contributed to 
928 shelter for them elsewhere, maybe sme other location downtown, and she
929 said they FED them instead -- twice a week.  Seems to me that only adds
930 to the crap ... Interesting attitudes for a church I'd say.
931  
932 So I wonder what they did with the benches.  Bet they went to some APP
933 location around town or maybe to the vast Ames charity estate(s).
934  
935 But I find this particularly offensive because my father's family was
936 the type to take in homeless people.  His brothers all worked on the
937 railroad and the one brother he had in Portland  fed and houses many
938 hobo-types over the years.  Not only that, but my cousin's wife spent
939 months "on the streets" of Washington DC after she'd vacationed there
940 some years back with a Swedish exchange student they'd had for a year.
941 She couldn't believe what was happening to people and was especially
942 embarrassed it was the nation's capital.   She's appeared on national
943 TV, was hired by Time-Life, does national speaking tours and has written
944 a book about it.
