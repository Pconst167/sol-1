29 A drowning man seeks a life perserver. A life perserver in the sense of some-
30 thing to save himself with. He seeks aid, help from others. Life perservers
31 rarely come from within, they must come from outside, from the hands and
32 hearts of others. Save me, save me, from the dark depths of the cold, heart-
33 less waters. Throw me a life perserver, give me a chance to live again. I am
34 too weak to look inside for help. Just this once, offer me a hand, lift me
35 from the waters, I have been drowning long enough.

39 There are some of us that desire so strongly for help that we may at times
40 not see the forest from the trees.  There is a vast sea of people that are
41 all standing with outstreched hands, wishing to be pulled from their
42 miseries.  We are all human, we all have our flaws.  To finally realize
43 that we suffer the same anxieties doesn't mean much when the time has come
44 for each to suffer them on our own.  The blue, blue isolation clouds our 
45 eyes...  we do not see the outstretched hand beside us.
46 How long have I been waiting?

55 There are times when I just want to run away from it all, but where would 
56 I run to?  I plead for help, and all I get is denial, laughter, hatred.  
57 I am told that I am selfish and hateful, that what I want is wrong.  But 
58 is it wrong to love?  To want to be loved in return?  Is it wrong to 
59 desire the happiness needed to truly live?  Is it wrong to care about 
60 someone?  To want them to care for you?  I would do anything to that end.

83 How long will it be until we can trust our fellow human beings? How long will 
84 it be until they earn our trust? Each of us appears to stand alone, unmoving
85 among each other. Our souls reach out, only to be denied through blindness. 
86 We stand alone with the inability to see the person at our side.
87 
88 Is it possible to understand each other? Is that our species' flaw? With the
89 ability to think and communicate, we shall never learn the thoughts of each 
90 other. Each person having his own reality to shape his character, each person h
91 having his own thoughts to shape his perspective, how can we reach even the 
92 lowest level of understanding? Digging through the layers and layers of 
93 memories and forgotten times, how can we even know ourselves?
94 
95 The structure of our society is an interaction between individuals. Fear 
96 overshadows that interaction so in emotional expression is withheld. Our 
97 agonies burn within before the flame sees others. We are not that different 
98 after all.
99 
100 We don't stand alone. Yet the world seems harsh, an angry stare received by a
101 stranger cuts deep, we cower, allowing ourselves to be swept away by the sea.
102 The salwater bathes my wounds and stings like laughter in my face.

125 "Do you really think this will work, Doctor?"
126 I gazed at the twisted mass of metal, wires, and black boxes.  A few switches
127 had been inserted along several of the wires, but those had all been left
128 to hang where they were.  Overall, I received the impression that The Doctor
129 had soldered the dashboards of several dozen automobiles together.
130 "Don't worry.  [Author's note: see 'When to Worry, a Handy Reference Guide']
131 This'll track the source of that hole thing.  Did you find what you were
132 looking for?  That arrrghentite stuff?"
133 "Argentium, Doctor.  Only a very small amount."  I showed him the small chunk
134 of silver rock Grann and I had spent three hours looking for.  "Not nearly
135 enough for what I have in mind."
136 "Which is....?"
137 "To find the source of the Convolution.  If we deem it necessary, to sever
138 the being(s) conduit of travel.  I have about 200 grams of Argentium- it will
139 be necessary to find nearly two more kilos."
140 "I hate to go into anything unprepared.  Shall we find more of your rock before
141 continuing?"
142 "Unless you have a gadget that can produce-" I named a mind-boggling amount of
143 energy, "that I can channel.  Frankly, I doubt such a device exists."
144 "All right, so we become rockhounds temporarily.  Have you a good idea where
145 to get more?"
146 "Yes, and this amount should be enough to get us there.  I'm only worried
147 about getting back.  There won't be enough if we don't find any."
148 "Oh, well, if that's all that's bothering you-" he grinned, and his eyes held
149 that familiar mischeivous gleam, "then what are we waiting for?"

152 	From the woodwork, like a thousand slithering vipers, come
153 the cries and shouts of those just like myself. I too am a serpent
154 slithering in agony and pain. I too wish to cry and shout at my
155 misfortune, just like the others around me. We are not so different
156 us vipers, us snakes, us creepy crawling manifestations that live
157 in this world, yet live on a different level, a lower level, because
158 we are not complete. If we were made complete by addition, we would
159 raise above the level we find ourselves at now, and shirk and peel
160 the viper's skin that surrounds us. We would again join the human
161 race, a race of people not meant to be alone. I seek out this
162 answer to evolution just like my fellow serpents do. We all want
163 the same thing. We all want to rejoin the human race.

167 	One never has to be alone.  You always have someone who will
168 listen to.  But sometimes it is hard to know who to go to.  Sometimes
169 it is easier to just wander off by yourself and think things out, but
170 at the same time this causes many to go into a deeper depression.  Talk
171 things out with a friend.  There all always outstretched arms willing to
172 help all you need to do is open your door and look.

270      All this talk of life preservers and outstreached arms is getting to me.
271 Doesn't anyone learn how to swim anymore?  Must we always look uotside ourselves
272 for salvation?  If there is any devine innervention, weeping in the dark seems
273 a dim way to earn it.  If there is none, the tears are just wasted water.  The 
274 most powerful belief is the belief in oneself, and the rewards are immediate and
275 are not subject to the whims of others.  People are like cats, they do not 
276 caress us, they caress themselves on us.  And we do the same.  We chose our
277 friends, lovers, even our enemies, in accordance with patters of our own 
278 choosing.  And they do the same.  It is the way we are.
279      Friendships grow old, loves grow bitter, and old foes become amiable.  Each
280 day the road of our lives pass below our feet, and the scenery that seemed so 
281 involving just days before dims in the distance.  And in our travels we find new
282 friends, discover new loves, and make new enemies.  That is the adverture.
283      But their are those that fear the road ahead, and seek the safety of the
284 roadside.  Fearing change more than stagnation.

289 Learning individual worth, confidene in one's self is indeed important. 
290 But we are dependant on each other, we need interaction and trust amongst
291 our species. It goes back to predators and survival. A community was far better
292 of than he who walks alone. The difficulty is a social one, when the enemy is
293 each other.
294 
295 Perhaps, learning to do for one's self is one of the most difficult but 
296 beneficial lessons. Another is learning how to care, or showing someone that
297 you can be a friend. One they can trust.

304 The farmer, the socialite, the builder, these are artificial.  Inventions of
305 the genetic accident called intelligence.
306      It is in our nature that we have our real strength.  Our intellegence our
307 direction, not our thrust.
308      Each of us have the power, the will, the confidence.  But little by little
309 the social inventions strip them away, dulling our senses, muting our ancestry.

350   Somewhere, somewhen, in a featureless grey mist a chance combination of
351 chemical and electrical energy exceeded a variable threshold.  The 
352 insignificance of the action paled with the result.
353   The output of the neuron went out and crossed several synapses, bringing more
354 hypersensitive neurons past their thresholds, causing in turn more impulses to
355 bridge the tiny gaps that separated one cell from the next.  This cascade of
356 electrical and chemical energry swept through the sensation-starved brain
357 of the piper, growing as it propigated, becoming patterned by the very 
358 topology of his brain and nervous system.  The patterns, in turn, reverberated
359 through the nerve-net, interfering with each other, altering thresholds,
360 changing patterns, increasing the complexity of the electro-chemical 
361 wavefront that surged and roared through the waiting sensation-starved brain.
362   The piper, adrift in limbo, had seen and heard nothing for a very long
363 time.  He had no sensation of his body, and sensibly avoided trying to move.
364 He realized, just as he began to try to kick, that with no feeling, that
365 the powerful muscles of his legs and torso could seriously damage himself.
366   The vision of the powerful leg muscles bending and snapping his thigh
367 bones, forcing the jagged bone ends through muscles, veins, arteries, and
368 skin -- letting the contained vital bloodstream out to dissapate within this
369 featureless space, and incedentally his life with it -- caused him to 
370 instantly relax.  Hanging limply, he could only wait, hoping that no
371 damage had been done before he realized the danger.
372   The tiny stirrings of the grey fog before his eyes suddenly began to increase
373 into small vorteces.  One by one, the tiny twistings in the greyness began to
374 absorb one another until they had combined in one huge twisting funnel.
375 To his aching ears, a muted roaring slowly increased in volume, until the
376 vibrations seemed to shake his very bones -- an alien sensation so long had
377 he been divorced from bodily sensation.  Scents began reaching his nose --
378 rare perfumes, homily scents, the putrescence of rank corruption intermingled
379 into a chaos of smells as the vortex reached him, spun him, and began to
380 carry him on the beginning of another journey.

388         To be happy all the time is not to be happy at all.  Although there's a farm near Salem

399 ReNAN: Don't mock others just because you consider yourself well adjusted and
400 in no need of help from others. Everybody isn't as secure with themselves as
401 you obviously feel you are with yourself. Messages like "Can't anybody swim
402 by themselves anymore" don't help a bit and instead hurt. There are several
403 people here who within the safety of the single alphabetic letter have been
404 able to write down their innermost feelings and share them with others of the
405 same circle. Please do not break in with self-righteous monologue condemming
406 those who are still in need of help. We don't need it and we don't want it.
407 Be welcome to partake in the discussions, but don't damn without knowing us
408 any better.

421 I give you back your circle.  But it is good to see you defend yourself so

428    "Cragmore! What's happening Cragmore? Can you reach Piper?" Trainor's manner
429 revealed the urgency and importance of the questions.
430    But Cragmore couldn't respond, less he lose whatever slim thread of contact
431 he had achieved with the adventurer's missing companion.
432    "You must not disturb him Trainor." Bard advised. "The psi contact is a 
433 fragile one, and outside stimulus could nullify the progress Cragmore may
434 have already made."
435    "I understand, but we can't sit here forever. Look at these gauges. The
436 Pell-mell is taking substantial buffeting from the turbulence the ZEB creature
437 caused when it passed through here. Emu, your idea has some merit, but I don't
438 know how we can maintain sufficient integrity within an air bubble on the
439 exterior of this ship with this much turbulence. The grav-dampers keep the
440 insides of the ship at pre-defined levels, but outside it is a maelstrom of
441 intra-reality stuff."
442    "Stuff? You sound like that 20th century Terran astronomer, Sagen I believe
443 his name is." laughed Lady Tyree.
444    "Well, stuff, for lack of a better term. Emu, without Cragmore's help in
445 getting us closer to Piper's location, I don't think we can risk a grav-bubble
446 outside the ship. Now if we are very close to his location, we could shut down
447 auxiliary systems and put as much output as we dare into the grav-generators,
448 and then, just maybe, we can put an envelope around Piper, and bring him back
449 into the ship. It all hinges on Cragmore and his ability to reach Piper."
450    Just then, Cragmore stirred from his lotus-like position, slowly opened his
451 eyes, and looked up at the assemblage who had gathered around him.
452    "I... am sorry. I can't seem to get Piper to respond. I believe he is caught
453 up in the ZEB's void to a very high degree. Sensory deprivation is a tricky
454 thing. A person who has been acutely aware of their senses all their life
455 is more likely to be confused and disoriented when those senses are taken away.
456 I can see him, but he doesn't seem to be able to see me. I tried speaking to
457 him, but he apparently isn't listening. I... don't know..."
458    "Don't know what Cragmore?" Trainor queried.
459    "It, I hesitate to say this, but it... it sometimes seemed like he didn't
460 want to see me or hear me. I can't be sure though. Mind you, the ZEB area isn't
461 the optimum place for psi communications."
462    "Well why on earth wouldn't he want to communicate and get back on the ship?"
463    "I certainly can't answer that. All I know is I can be sensitive to such
464 feelings and those are the feelings I got from Piper. It could be the void, or
465 it could be interference. For a void area, it is void only in terms of our
466 dimensional understandings."
467    Emu perked up at this last comment. "What do you mean 'our dimensional
468 understandings?'"
469    "Just what I said. The ZEB creature came from beyond our zones of reality,
470 and it appears that beyond those zones our rules and our concepts don't apply.
471 It is difficult to describe. Perhaps... Yes, I have an idea!"
472    Trainor was growing impatient. "We MUST hurry Cragmore. While the Pell-mell
473 is a well-built ship, it can not withstand too much more stationary
474 positioning within the ZEB path. We either move, and possibly loose our common
475 placement with piper, or we sit still and possibly break apart."
476    "Ok, I understand. Trainor, you keep at the controls, everyone else, join me
477 in a semi-circle here on the deck. Everyone has some latent psi ability, some-
478 times it just needs a little push to emerge on the surface. Join hands
479 everyone, except Lady Tyree and Bard. Leave a space about three feet apart
480 between you. This space in our semi-circle is where Piper's essence, if we can
481 reach him, will sit. Nothing in psi is more powerful than the attraction of
482 a semi-circle for the part that will make it complete. With our combined
483 powers, we should be able to reach him. If not, then there is no chance."
484    Tin Man, Bard, Tyree, Fencer, Emu, and Cragmore all sat in the prescribed
485 geometry, each holding hands with those to the left and right, save the space
486 for the missing adventurer. Cragmore took the lead again as Trainor, from the
487 control room, looked on in amazement.
488    "Now flush your minds, and let me be the focus of your thought. Through all
489 of us we will reach out to Piper and try to bring him in to complete the
490 circle, complete the circle, complete the circle..."
491    Trainor had never seen anything like it. The area above the semi-circle
492 appeared to glow with an aura of no identifiable source. Would this attempt
493 be successful at rescuing piper? Trainor wondered and worried has he prepared
494 the Pell-mell to follow Cragmore's directions to Piper, if any directions
495 should come.

531      The green land was green and the crimson leaves were sort of a dark red
532 color.  The earth beneath Aystring's feet was firmly packed and obviously well
533 traveled.  Along either side rose gigantic oak trees surrounded by soft beds of
534 grass whose blades, though quite large at times, were not as large as the oak
535 trees.  Standing majestically, yet modestly in front of him was a forcefully
536 passive and altogether radiant but not completely mundane looking building.
537 The strange and powerful force that caused Aystring to pull open the door 
538 involved the building's architecture which prevented the door from opening 
539 inward.
540      Aystring's senses were immediately alerted to the striking differences 
541 between the wilderness from which he was coming and the Inn he had just entered.
542 Such a contrast!  Though both places had the look of human travel, were
543 surrounded by wood, had the taste of adventure, were damp and dirty, and smelled
544 of smoke, Tthe Inn was a little darker than the woods were,.  Aystring took a fe
545 few moments to adjust to the drastic change in surroundings.
546      The innkeeper was cleaning up a pile of rabbit droppings while a group of
547 armchair adventurers amused themselves around a hearty fire.  It was one of
548 those special kinds of fire you very rarely see -- the kind with flames and
549 smoke.  The rabbit droppings weren't all that special.
550      As near as Aystring could tell, the main topic of conversation seemed to
551 concern a quest for a cigarette which had been kidnapped by a Japanese Buddhist
552 sect.  It was all very confusing, but he was sure he knew the meanings of Pall
553 Mall and Zen.  Deciding to join the group for a while, Aystring unstrapped his
554 peacekeeper sword and sat down.  The others watched with wonder as he introduced
555 himself, "Hi!  I'm Aystring and I'm new to this Inn!  This is a strange place!
556 Does anyone here know of any other Iinns I can visit?  PLEASE answer soon!  Bye.
557 Exit,., off, exit, help...."

561 Aystring: Salutations!  An "interesting" entry above, although I doubt very
562 much if our good Innkeeper would allow dust in the common room, much less
563 rabbit droppings.  Also, a fire usually is not lit unless the temperature
564 dictates this- not often, in summer months.  All together, though, much better
565 than my first greeting to the Inn.  Welcome!
566 As for other 'Inns', there aren't any.  BWMS is special.  There ARE other
567 'storyboards', Tanis for one (if it is still around), 761-0609.  I'm sure
568 other Innhabitants (Innklings?) can expand the list, or correct me if Tanis
569 is no longer as it was.

576 Once when I was little
577 I saw a deer
578 Young, as I was
579 Wobbling on new legs
580 Just a few feet away
581 
582 I held very still
583 As not to scare it away
584 For it was beautiful
585 And somehow
586 Being near it made me feel good
587 
588 I wanted to keep it
589 Like my jar of bugs
590 But, I decided,
591 It wouldn't fit in the bottle anyway
592 And it wouldn't be beautiful anymore
593 
594 After a moment
595 It tettered off
596 Into the trees
597 And I just stood there
598 And watched it go

604 the often harsh opinions of the established members of the Inn.  While my style
