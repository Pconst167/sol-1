21      The Innkeeper sat alone in the small room he kept for himself at the 
22 Inn, looking out the window watching the gray clouds slowly drift across 
23 the sky. Pulling a gold locket from beneath the worn cotton shirt he wore, 
24 he held it for a moment, his finger tracing the delicate runes lovingly 
25 inscribed on its case. Then, releasing the hidden catch, he opened it, and 
26 looked once more at the Rowan sprig about which the locket had been 
27 crafted by the best jeweler he could find.
28      How long had it been? It seemed like years, and yet it had only been 
29 a scant six months since that day Pam had given it to him. How things had 
30 changed since then. Her visits becoming shorter, and more remote. What had 
31 brought this on? What has caused her interest in the Inn to wane? 
32      Looking at the locket, the Innkeeper can almost see her sitting once 
33 more across from him smiling, and the words from an old Chad and Jeremy
34 song drifts through his mind. 
35 "They say that all good things must end someday, autumn leaves must fall."
36 "And when the rain beats against my window pane, I'll think of summer days 
37 again, and dream of you." 
38      Reaching out to caress her cheek, the image blurs and disappears 
39 behind his tears, and he is alone once again. Gently closing the locket, 
40 he replaces it inside his shirt, and turns to gaze out the window again.

53 My dearest Pam;
54      Your eyes are like limpid pools, your skin soft as satin, your voice
55 like a nightengale on a summer's eve. (Well, my daddy told me if I whisper
56 sweet nothings in a lady's ear, she'll do anything.  A guy has to try
57 doesn't he?)  Things are getting desperate.  The doo-doo is upto my
58 chest.  The County Inspector is nosing around, and now my bulldog, Edgar,
59 has disappeared.  Worst of all, Thing is starting to look at me with
60 a gleam in its eye.  I think it's the mating season.  Hurry!

66 NEW YORK (AP)  In a stunning turn of events, the SEC has approved the merger
67 of McKane Industries and Wassir Toilet Plungers Inc.  New SEC board
68 chairman, Monsiuer d'Autun, announced the merger at a New York press
69 conference this afternoon.  Monsiuer d'Autun had just been appointed 
70 chairmen by President Reagan a scant hour before.  Previous chairman, 
71 Wilbert Smyth-White, had suddenly given his resignation citing health
72 and family problems.  Monsiuer d'Autun stated, "This merger is great,
73 not only for industry but for America.  I can only hope that I can
74 fulfill Leroy McKane's legacy in conducting this office in the way he
75 would want me to."  President of Wassir Industries, Mohammed Wassir, was
76 unavailable ofor comment.  He is believed to be vacationing in the
77 Black Sea area.

82 NEW YORK (UPI)  Echos of the hit movie War Games were heard today as it was
83 revealed that the Associated Press News Wire was broken into by three Portland
84 area teenagers using sophisticated computer and telephone equipment.
85 
86    The youths' Commodore 64 and Vic modems were confiscated by a crack team of
87 five FBI agents specializing in communications espionage.
88 
89    "The situation is fully under control, and the perpetrators are in
90 custody. We want to make it perfectly clear that the public should dis-
91 regard all AP wire service messages from the previous week until further
92 notice.", FBI agent W. L. Built read from a prepared statement.
93 
94    The juveniles involved were identified as Chris Bradley, Darrin Spokely,
95 and Eric Wilson. They belong to a computer club called the Tri-Bytes.
96 
97    AP wire spokesman Jack Daniels was quoted as saying, "I don't know how they
98 did it. It was a one-in-a-million breakthrough. We pride ourselves in having
99 some of the best telecommunications security in the nation."
100 
101    The crackers, as they are commonly called, were said to have entered false
102 messages involving the planned merger between two larger corporations. It is
103 not known why these particular companies were singled out, but an investigation
104 is under way.                  RELATED STORY LINE 107

107 New York (UPI) - In a strange sequence of events, involving a west coast
108 computer club and their alleged break in at the Associated Press central
109 computer, the SEC announced it had definitely not authorized any mergers
110 involving Mckane Industries, due to an ongoing investigation of the company
111 by the Justice Department for sex discrimination charges, and the SPCA for
112 alleged unnatural acts involving small furry animals.

115 HOLLYWOOD (UPI)  George Lucas and Steven Spielberg announced today that they
116 will coproduce and direct the life story of Leroy McKane.  Reported to be
117 the most expensive production in motion picture history, the epic will
118 be simply entitled, "Leroy".  Mr. Lucas stated, "This will be the greatest
119 picture of all time.  We've signed Paul Newman as Leroy McKane and Robert
120 Redford as Mohammed Wassir.  The climax will be when Leroy and Mohammed
121 enter the ghostly Inn to recover the Crown Jewels and Shroud of Turin
122 stolen by the dreaded Darth Vader and his minions, the NET operatives."
123 Spokesmen for the Three Stooges, Larry, Moe, and Curly Joe, confirmed they
124 will return from retirement to portray the operatives of the NET.  It is
125 rumored that Boy George is cast as Petrov, the KGB drag queen.  Darth
126 Vader will appear as himself.
127 
128 WASHINGTON (UPI)  President Ronald Reagan confirmed that he would return to
129 the silver screen to appear in the epic motion picture, "Leroy".  At a
130 special press conference, President Reagan said, "This role is too good to
131 pass up.  Besides I owe it to my good friend and mentor Leroy.  This one
132 is for him."  President Reagan will portray the Good Witch of the North.

214 the fruit-bearing plants, there is plenty.  Odd.  Never saw EVERYTHING in season all at once before.
215 The weather is pleasant, the sky blue, and small animals scamper and huddle not too far from the mansion, within easy
216 view of the lawn chairs on the patio.  Two men sit there, watching.  One seems very old, beyond age of mortal men, 
217 but his eyes show life undying.  His unkempt beard gives him somewhat of a wild look, but his manner is of a cultured
218 gentleman.  The other man is much younger, but of indeterminate age.  His face used to be seen regularly at the Inn...
219 Milchar.  He sits and talks with his mentor with great respect and with some awe.
220 The Doctor, and his Tardis, arrive on the patio with a whirr.  The aged man gazes at him for a moment.  "Cidrin.  Find
221 a chair inside.  I must learn of Milchar's progress, and then you two must travel again."

237 Given the generally abominable level of intelligibility on this board,
238 and since I am tired of those boringly long narrative stories and arguments
239 so prevalent lately, I hereby offer this possibility:
240 (This is particularly dedicated to Dreamtoucher, and to people who spell it
241 `germain' instead of `germane').    {and Mikey?}
242 
243 George Bernard Shaw was an advocate of verbal rationalisation, and urged
244 spelling reform, suggesting that one letter be altered or deleted each year;
245 this method would give the populace time to absorb the change.
246 For example, in Year 1 that useless letter `c' would be dropped, to be
247 replaced by either `k' or `s,' and likewise `x' would no longer be part of the
248 alphabet.  The only kase in which `c' would be retained would be the `ch'
249 formation which will be dealt with later.
250 Year 2 might well reform `w' spelling, so that `which' and `one' would
251 take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish `y,' replacing it with
252 `i,' and Iear 4 might fiks the `g-j' anomali wonse and for all.
253 Jenerally then, the improvement would kontinue iear bi iear, with
254 Iear 5 doing awei with useles double konsonants, and Iears 6 - 12 or so
255 modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants.  Bi Ier 15 or
256 so, it wud fainali bi posibl tu meik ius ov thi ridundnt letez `c,' `y,' and

275 NET 06,
276      My apologies for sinking so low, but the old "breaking into the AP
277 newswire" trick was used several months ago.  It was in response to a
278 news story concerning, I think, Leroy McKane.  You might have missed it.
279 I didn't mean to ruffle your feathers.
280      I must say that whoever placed the rebuttal, you perhaps ?, did an
281 excellant job.  It was very clever.  Perhaps you would like to switch
282 sides?  The McKane-Wassir consortium offers excellent pay, benefits far
283 above the industry average, and the opportunity for rapid advancement
284 for a self-starter.  Maybe you fit into our plans.  We're growing rapidly
285 and need someone of your obvious talents.  Let me know if you're
286 interested.

300            Just a note from an old Pascal veteran.
301 Quizmaster: I seem to recall that George Bernard Shaw also had something to
302             say about party-poopers. I believe he called them the most
303             despicable people around. Since they always have a knack for
304             ending the party, and since he enjoyed parties so much, I guess
305             I can see his point of view. And if I am not mistaken, I believe
306             it was also GBS who said,
307             "The V-8 engine is God's gift to man. There is no substitute.

363 MiG :  It hurt my pride more then it hurt my Laser, basicly a small
364 paint scratch, and a pinched area on my rear bumper. I must say,
365 they do have some well built cars coming out of Chrysler these days.
366 (Even if they are mostly from Japan.) The Datsun That hit me had
367 about $300-$400 in damage done to his front. The really strange part
368 about the whole thing though was that the exact same thing happened
369 to the very first car I owned (64 Chev), I was waiting at a stop
370 light for the guy in front of me to decide if he was going to move
371 or not on the green light, and the next thing I know there is a 
372 large 'bump' from the rear. The 64 received a paint scrap on the 
373 trunk, and a broken tail light. The 68 Chev that hit me had about
374 $600 in damage to its front. Again I had only had the car for a few
375 months when it happened. But in the case of my new 84 Turbo Laser,
376 it hurts particularly since I hardly have 3000 miles on it yet. I
377 had hoped I could at least get thru a year or so before it started
378 to get all dinged up. Sigh, I guess I should have expected this.
379 Though it did take 5 years before someone decided to customize
380 my 75 Vega for me. (It took me another 4 to decide to total it.)
381 I do like the Laser though, at last I have found a car that I like 
382 better then my old 62 Impala SS. It has all the power of the old
383 62 and much better handling. And a whole lot better gas milage.
384 With the old 327 honker in there and the two speed slush box, I
385 was lucky to get 20 MPG on a long trip. I get 33 in the Laser, and
386 23 around town. Thats as good or better then the old Vega got when
387 it was new!

405 Alex, no I didn't.  But, I will now.  Not all of them, just one message at
406 a time. (wait a moment, switching to 120 columns)
407 I'm back! (obviously)  Now, are you trying to do what I am, in my spare time?  If so, mayhap we can compare notes.
408 I believe that I could get pretty dangerous with my computer now that I have a disk drive.  God help the world if I
409 ever get my hands on an IBM, or (shudder), something even better.

411 The Doctor began relating the events that had occurred since the impounding of his Tardis, and about the death of 
412 Leroy McKane.  Milchar tried to express his progress in Enchanter magicks, but was clearly embarrassed at his slow 
413 learning.  "Fear not that you will not understand it soon, for you have a trial ahead of you.  Trials teach men how to
414 do what they feel they cannot.  This trial is a sore one - do you remember what I had told you about a planet called
415 Corona, the land of the Sun-people?  Well, Sundownor has returned there, plotting to take anything he can get from 
416 Earth since his agreement with McKane was broken with his death.  I believe that he wishes the Inn, and now the Earth
417 itself."  "And our trial?"  "Merely to stop him.  Remember that I have taught you not to kill if it can be avoided. 
418 Remember:  Do not maim when hurting is enough, Do not kill when maiming is enough, and the greatest warrior is he who
419 does not kill."  Milchar and the Doctor were silent, thinking back on the times when they were tempted to break this 
420 rule.  "But, my friends, I give you this last aid.  Remember Kabaal.  That is a word bound with power.  Few may say it
421 without invoking magic.  Now, off you go, and may Kajal ward you!"
422 As Dimat said that, Milchar, the Doctor, and the Tardis were enveloped in a rainbow of colors and mists, and faded
423 away slowly.....

430 A.  Five.  While Cinnamon creates a diversion by wearing a skimpy dress,
431     I use a tiny narcotic dart to knock out the fascist dictator and remove
432     his body.  Rollin, wearing a plastic mask, masquerades as the dictator long
433     enough for Barney to sneak up to the next floor, drill a hole down into the
434     light bulb fixture, remove the burned-out bulb, and replace it with a new,
435     super-high-wattage model of his own design.  Meanwhile, Willy has driven up
436     to the door in a laundry truck.  Just before Rollin's real identity is
437     revealed, we escape to the laundry truck, drive to the airfield, and return
438     to the United States.

455 Leroy,
456      Success is at hand.  The SEC, in secret session, approved the merger
457 of our companies.  M. d'Autun will ensure that nothing gets in our way.
458 My calculations indicate that the cash flow of our megacorporation combined
459 with the rake-off from our counterfeit Cappage Patch Doll operation will
460 enable us to gobble up the entire Fortune 500 within the next five years.
461 Soon, the world will be ours!
462      Also, I must say that I really enjoyed having you on my yacht on the
463 Black Sea.  We must do it again.  Why don't you and the little lady drop
464 over for drinks sometime this week.  Serena is always bugging me to
465 entertain more.  I've also got a fresh supply of small, fuzzy animals
466 for your pleasure (Whatever that may be).
467                                             Regards,

472 DRIVE B IS BACK AGAIN. NOW HERE IS AN INTERESTING STORY, WHEN I
473 DISMANTALED THE SYSTEM TO FIND OUT WHY DRIVE B DECIDED TO STOP
474 WORKING, I NOTICED THAT DRIVE B HAD ITS RESISTOR PACK IN IT. THEN
475 I HAPPEN TO NOTICE THAT DRIVE A HAD ITS RESISTOR PACK IN IT TOO.
476 SO THE FIX WAS RATHER EASY, I REMOVED THE RESISTOR PACK FROM DRIVE
477 B AND EVERYTHING IS HUNKY-DORRY. IT MUST HAVE GOT LEFT IN THERE
478 ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO WHEN I HAD DRIVE PROBLEMS BEFORE. THE QUESTION
479 IS, WHY DID IT TAKE UNTIL NOW TO DECIDE IT DIDN'T LIKE IT?!

488 Now that's a lively subject to dissect: "what Makes Th e Oregon Driver
489 Tick?" So far this year i have been nearly run vover 5 times, had to leap
490 out of the way of people making right turns at stop signs/lights,
491 been cut in front of or off too many times to count, and of course, tried
492 to read the mind of the guy in front who seems to think he going to turn
493 but can't decide which way to go. I've also noticed that every driver
494 alive (or so it appears) thinks that the streets are intercionnected to
495 the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. One things for certain, I don't have
496 any difficulty staying awake or sober when I'm behind the wheel.

499 The part I hate is when some idiot decides to pull in front of traffic 
500 to see if there is room to make a left turn.  My horn seems to be the
501 first part of a vehicle I wear out.  Never had an accident, but I have
502 lost two to wiring fires.
503 to :=:=:  :  I can probably help you, but I have no idea what the number
504 of the pine street tavern is, and I also dont know who to ask for when I
505 get there.
506 TO ALL:  I shall be needing a ride to los angeles twords the end of the 
507 summer, specificly I want to be there between the dates of august 30 to 
508 september 5th.  If you can help me either one way or both, please leave 
509 me a message.  Reason for trip:WORLDCON.
