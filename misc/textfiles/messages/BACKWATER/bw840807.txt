54    RAINdeer (BWBB) - Thousands are expected for the 'Dance of the Dangerfield'
55    festival to be held here in RAINdeer starting this weekend.
56 
57    Followers of the world famous guru Rajneesh Dangerfield will be converging
58    on this small town located in Eastern Oregon to celebrate the first
59    anniversary of this establishment, which before the arrival of the
60    Rajneeshies, was a small agricultural community.
61 
62    The population is expected to swell to 15 thousand or more, according to
63    Dangerfield's right-hand woman, Ma prem Rivers.
64 
65    "Can we talk? OK... Yes we expect at least 15 thousand to come to our
66     celebration. It is our first birthday, and we are very proud to be here.",
67     Rivers told the press corps covering the festival.
68 
69    All around the town posters and other festival paraphernalia are being hung
70    in honor of Rajneesh Dangerfield, the ex-Hollywood guru who brought his
71    followers here to Oregon in an attempt to establish a larger following with
72    Northwesterners. It has been rumored that the guru has connections with
73    Leroy Mckane, noted religious leader who recently died, but these rumors
74    have been categorically denied by public relations head Swami Ed-meese.
75 
76    Ed-meese re-assured the twenty or so reporters that there indeed was no
77    connection between the Rajneeshies and the Mckane organization, and the
78    vicious rumors were the work of disgruntled ranchers in the area.

84         The darkness of the room betrayed little of its size. Except for
85 the glare of the tensor lamp on the Muvuli desk the only other sources of
86 light were the residual phosphoresence from the many displays surrounding
87 the seated man. His eyes darted from one to the next, never lingering.
88 Absorbing what was pertinent an rejecting all else. These screens were his 
89 eyes to the world and few subtleys missed his practiced mind. 
90         A faint chime sounded as a small press release was being displayed.
91 As was always the case when ever a project he was involved with hit the press.
92 He scaned the text and smiled inwardly as he read the phrase 
93 ......" Festival paraphernalia "...... he thought ; how true ; There is 
94 humor in irony . 
95         The switch had taken place in Yokohama where the " Prem Maru " had  
96 stopped for cargo. And soon he thought few of Dangerfield zealots would  
97 be without his own brand of enlightenment. 
98         Phase 1 had progressed without error. He now turned his thoughts to 
99 the future. To satisfy the rage that had burned within him since childhood.
100 How often the scene had been played in his mind. Closing his eyes the familiar
101 memory filled his being. Once again he was in the highlands of the old country
102 watching his father being eased into the grave. He had been too young to 
103 understand all that was about him. Yet the last words his father said to him 
104 were " Mc Henry". 
105         The buzzing of the intercom brought his thoughts back to the present.
106 A familiar voice said " Mr. McEalvain the gentlemen have arrived ". Turning 
107 to the set he said " Send them in ". He turned and pressed a button and the 
108 curtains parted revealing the panoramic view of the Clarence straits and
109 Timor sea. Walking to the window he heard them enter, without turning
110 he said " Gentlemen, phase one is complete. How do we stand with the 
111 opposition ? are they conditioned yet ?"
112  
113 '/,                                                                        '/,

116 
117 L'homme - I appreciate your thoughtful response.  I do fear the effects of 
118           continued defecit spending.  I think the problem will be solved
119           in time by the increased size of the taxable base.  That is what
120           most current economists believe also, so I may be wrong.  
121           I feel that the defecit in the military area is necessary for the
122           present to permit a return to a strong bargaining position.
123 
124           Something that might be distasteful to the general populace of BWBBS,
125           but makes great economic sense would be supporting a conventional war
126           in Central America.  It provides a great stimulus to the economy, as
127           shown by history.  I am not so cynical as to think that was the reason
128           for historical wars, but I suppose it is possible. 
129 
130           I am opposed however, to the thought of nuclear war as a winnable
131           option, having been brought up with the concept of MAD.  I do feel
132           that it is necessary to provide for the accurate, impregnable
133           delivery methods.
134 
135 /.,/.,/.,/., - There is something here for everyone.  I spend my working hours 
136                as a spy and fighting dragons, so I need the escape from my
137                real world.  (Perspective - use it or lose it. R. Bach)

172 Dangerfield proxy.

183 AH YES, THE OLD ARGUMENT THAT WAR BRINGS ECONOMIC IMPROVMENT. I OFTEN
184 WONDER WHERE THOSE FIGURES THAT ARE PUT FORTH SAYING THAT WAR IS GOOD
185 FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COME FROM. EVERY TIME I HAVE LOOKED INTO THE
186 MATTER, WHAT I HAVE SEEN IS SHORT TERM IMPROVEMENT UNTIL YOU EAT UP
187 YOUR SPARE RESOURCES, THEN THINGS GO IN THE DUMPER UNTIL A RECOVERY 
188 CAN BE EFFECTED. AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PRECIOUS LITTLE RESOURCES LEFT
189 TO THROW AT A WAR. MOST OF IT HAS BEEN EATEN UP BY THE YEARS OF DEFICIT
190 SPENDING BY UNCLE. NO, WAR WON'T HELP IN THE LONG RUN, IT WILL ONLY MAKE
191 REALITY ALL THAT HARDER TO FACE UP TO WHEN THE TIME COMES. YOU CAN'T
192 CONTUINUE TO SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE AND GET AWAY WITH IT FOREVER!
193 IT HAS TO COME FROM SOMEPLACE! IT MY BE AN OLD CLICHE, BUT IT IS TRUE
194 NONE THE LESS; THERE AIN'T NO FREE LUNCH! HOW POLITICIANS FIGURE THEY

199 It was a typical case of blind justice today in the first of a long series of risk games when L'homme Sans Parity 
200 so close to winning, left one tiny army in Japan. Now, at this very moment, Alex is turning in enough cards to 
201 probably win the entire game. MiG, as usual, lost early due to stupid mistakes. Voyeur is even now a force in the game
202 being decided. Leonard was reduced to 2 countries early in the game and never had much of a chance. This is the

208 We're playing a game called GEOPOLITIQUE, where we're the US cabinet.  The
209 computer plays the USSR.  The object: world domination.  Currently, the
210 US is in trouble.  We've lost a lot of prestige, and this has made negotiations
211 all but impossible.  The Secretary of State, under pressure, has recommended
212 invasion of certain minor powers who would not co-operate.  Even the UK has
213 turned away from us, and become pro-eastern country.  Tune in quickly,
214 because even as we speak, the US prepares to invade UK, and Opec.  This pushes
215 us very close to WWIII.

228    Astoria (UPI) - Tradgedy marked the RAINdeer festival when word reached
229       the Eastern Oregon religous group that the ship, the "Prem Maru",
230       ran aground and broke up in rough seas off the northern tip of Oregon.
231 
232       The ship, carrying several tons of festival paraphernalia, was trying
233       to enter the Columbia River at a screaming ebb. The ship ran aground
234       and broke up on Peacock Spit. All hands were lost, and none of the
235       cargo was recovered.
236 
237       Long Beach Washington residents reported Rajneesh cupie dolls washing
238       up on the shore at high tide.
239 
240       The owners of the ship declined comment.
241 
242       Replacement festival materials are being shipped in from an un-
243       specified location, a Rajneesh spokesman said.

257 Milchar and the Doctor were lying on the top of a low hill, trying to discover the city's weaknesses.  It was walled,
258 surrounded by a forcefield, and guards walked around at two-minute intervals.  Not too positive.
259 "Doctor,why don't we shift into shadows?", Milchar asked.  "Because YOU can, and I can't! ", the Doctor fumed,
260 obviously very annoyed at a weakness being shown in his near-spotless "armor".

362 Sunday. I will make the BEST copies you have ever seen. I promise.
363 Alex: Thanks again for having our motly crew over. I am only sorry
364 I overlooked that little island off the coast of China in the
365 first game. Nuclear Risk is fun, I think I enjoyed that one more,
366 even though I was one of the first ones wiped out. (thanks mig)
367 I hope our incredible lateness didn't mess up your body clock too
368 much. Again thanks...You are a fine opponent and host.
369 (and never, never, let be drink that orange stuff again. I mean
370 that stuff is mean!)
371 QUIZMASTER : Mind if I leave some stuff about randomness? I am
372 going to compile a small file on the subject, but I don't want
373 to barge in to your territory if you object.
374 Ted: Well, what can I say. You have managed to ruin any respect
375 I had for your personna here on backwater, with your uncalled for
376 personal insults towards LF. I am not trying to stick up for him,
377 nor am I defending his point of view, I am defending backwater
378 from incipient messages like yours. You managed to move from the
379 level of friendly thoughtful debate, to the level of insulting
380 abusive name calling. Take a look at the CISTOP's message. Did
381 he utilize name-calling? Did he use personal attacks as a form
382 of rebuttle? No, you did. It seems like you have something good
383 to say, so say it, and leave out the other junk. One of the best
384 tools and good writer and debater can have is an open mind and some
385 amount of tolerance for the opinions of others.

399 L'homme,
400 I hope to have the body clock back in sync by monday...I was so
401 wound for sound after the second game, sleep was a remote instinct at best.
402 I puttered around the kitchen...cleaned up ... made arrangements to send
403 the empty container of that vile orange liquid to Hanford for study, perhaps
404 it might be the cause of so much UN-RANDOMNESS. In any case I didnt want 
405 it laying around here. 
406 
407 Anyway got to the reclining postition around 6:30 or so....only
408 to have Barbs alarm clock go off at 6:45...got up made breakfast & got her
409 on the way to the coast by 8:00...Died by pool and rejoined reality already
410 in progress at 3:00 in the afternoon...
411 Bet you never forget Japan again...
412 voyeur,
413 Well done second game ... Such restraint, never using your nuke.
414 That make the second time the winner never deployed " The Bomb ".....
415 any comments ?....If this trend continues an adjustment to the rules 
416 might be in order.
417 MiG,
418 Your nomadic existance seems to have spilled over into the game...
419 Next time the odds favor you having some place to call continent...
420 providing L'homme refrains from bringing that anomaly producing orange 
421 substance. By the way did you receive any response ? 
422 
423 Leonard.......Siam will rise AGAIN.....I do admit it was a well placed 
424 strike.(grumble). I think you may have been in a stronger postition to repel
425 voyeur if you had remembered europe sooner. By the way did you have any of
426 that orange brew ? momentary brain death seems to have been side effect. 
427 
428 All in all  GOOD FUN ! .....I look forward to the next round

435      Can anybody offer advice on the 
436  best Terminal Program to buy for the
437  C-64, 1541 Disk Drive, and 1600 Modem?
438      I have heard that VIP Terminal and
439  Vidtex are good.

444 Alex: I enjoyed both games much. Probably because I had a better idea what
445 was going on.  Also because I made a better showing both games.  
446 (I hope to restrain any inclinations towards over-enthusiastic hack & slash
447 next time around - if I had gone North East and taken (MiG's?) cards instead
448 to West in the first game, I would have been a more serious contender rather
449 than a rapid has-been.  Like L'homme & Japan, it was a definite learning
450 experience.  Second game - If I had had a target as good as Leonard's (Siam),
451 I would have used it.  All I had most of the time was Western Europe, which
452 had only 8 or so men.  After I turned my cards in the second time (for men)
453 I lost that target, and subsequently my targets were only occupied by 1 or 
454 2 men, and didn't offer the secondary benifit of creating a bottleneck
455 for troop movement.  If I still had Europe targeted when I started taking
456 it over, you bet I'd have used it.
457 (plus I have a 'if I use it now, I might need it more later' bent.  
458 For instance, I still have fire crackers from 10 years ago, because I never
459 found the 'right' time to use them.)
460 {Now you have a psychological insight into what motivates the enemy, and
461 a better idea of how hard you can push.  Use it carefully - it is of
462 course consciously suspendable}.
463 L'homme: I've got 40 disks formatted with files allocated.  My first
464 use of DO files was a definite success (after I got the file set up,
465 it needed only one keystroke to treat each disk.)  When shall we
466 make the transfer?
467 Mikey: I deleted 26 lines of CR's etc following Alex's msg - you may
468 want to compress the file before moving to drive B, so all that space
469 isn't wasted.

480 No Border Yet.. No Border Yet.. No Border Yet.. No Border Yet.. No Border Yet..
481      The 1984 Dance of the Dangerfield festival promised to be the most
482 important event in Rajneesh history.  Known to many outsiders as the annual
483 "Unnatural Acts Festival," local ranchers seem to agree that it would be wise to
484 lock up their sheep for the duration of the affair.
485      With humble pride (?) Rajneesh Dangerfield watched as the little town of
486 RAINdeer underwent preparations for the coming event.  Ma Prem Rivers, his
487 constant shadow, oversaw many of the details.  "Several of the special guests
488 have just arrived, oh spiritually enlightened one--ye who sees all, knows all,
489 and can squeeze the blood of love from the turnip of humanity."  Rivers was
490 prone to using long, descriptive titles.
491      Dangerfield smiled faintly.  The leaders of the most powerful religious
492 communes and prayer groups in the world would attend this festival.  He set out
493 to greet the two new guests.
494 
495      Ma Prem Rivers introduced them.  "Oh holy of holies, exalted commander of 
496 all that has ever existed in the center of a collapsing supernovae and lived
497 to tell about it.." Dangerfield signalled her to speed up a little.  She did so.
498 "I give you the honorable Reverend Luna.  Well-known leader of the Lunies."
499 "I'm honored to meet you.  It's unfortunate about your Cupie Doll shipment,"
500 Luna said diplomatically.
501      Dangerfield stood calmly as Rivers responded. "That was all part of the 
502 grand design, I assure you."  Moving to the next visitor, she introduced him
503 as Carlos Sagan, leader of the Spanish Church of Spyentology.  Sagan claimed to
504 have "billions and billions" of followers, but it was well-known that he only
505 led about a thousand.
506 
507      Excitement was sure to be the order of the week at this festival.  Rajneesh
508 Dangerfield considered his position.  Surrounded by fifteen thousand adoring 
509 followers--all clad in the characteristic green clothes.  Visitors from the most
510 powerful religious organizations were gathering in RAINdeer Oregon to watch
511 the spectacle--and local ranchers threatened to do violence.  Word was reaching
512 Dangerfield's ears that the original inhabitants of RAINdeer were practising
513 various military maneuvers, and were aided by a group called 1001 Pals of Oregon.
514      Internally, Ma Prem Rivers carried on her own game--a quest for power.  She
515 was unaware that Dangerfield knew of her covert activities.  Indeed, Rivers
516 had a great deal of power in her position as the "gaping mouth of Rajneesh
517 Dangerfield."  Also, her private ring of spies was a force certainly to be
518 reckoned with.
519 
520      Woe to the unwitting individual who interferes with this powder-keg.
521                          R.D.
