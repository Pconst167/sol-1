20 L'homme: Thanks for the info, I'll check into the dropped character probelm,
21 One thing I am very interested in is the terminal emulation (VT100/ADM3A/VT52)
22 as I have had one bug report from the field that it gets lost when scrolling
23 down thru a file under EDT on a vax, but I have been unable to duplicate
24 it here. Also, I need to get you a new copy, the one you have has a few bugs
25 such as it appears that the arithmetic processor is processing right to left,
26 instead of left to right. It was recursing to the wrong place. also, the 
27 CLOSE and WRITE commands while appearing to work perfectly well actually
28 have a very MAJOR bug. They blowup go someplace in the code and destroy things
29 then somehow a self recovery occurs, and everything runs again, except some
30 random peice of code that gets destroyed. Perhaps that is the cause of the
31 lost characters. What is happening is that the routines are exiting to the
32 wrong place, and poping off 4 more levels of the stack then they should.
33 Also, I would like to know how closly the auto timing came out on the AT.
34 You can check it by giving the command TEST W it should then print a '*'
35 once each second. (use ^X to get back to command mode). The timming should
36 be within 20% and preferably within 10% (but I'm not picky).
37 ******************
38 John Silverman: Basicly, I follow the accepted norm of social rules here.
39 Yes, they change as time passes, as does society. I try to run BW for the
40 'mainstream' readers. This does mean that there are some limitations, such
41 as language, and sex, and even vilolence in certain aspects. I could pull
42 rank like other sysops do, and say tough, it's my BBS I'll run it the way
43 I feel, but I perfer to explain why I have the rules I do, certainly they
44 don't sit well with everyone, but as I said, I try to fit the mainstream
45 reader, thus certain limitations are required so as to not loose them. 
46 Certain words and actions are very disturbing to some people, and if there
47 is no need to say them why say them? All to often people use them to
48 try to prove that they are better then the other person because they
49 can control them thru the use of the words or actions. Yet all they
50 are proving is that they have no concern for the other persons eelings.
51 When you put something here keep in mind that it is a public forum,
52 and think of how you would act if you were talking in front of an
53 audience, because that is what you are doing, it is only delayed
54 slightly in time. An easy way to find out what is acceptable and what
55 isn't is to simply observe what others do and say. If you note, I
56 do allow an occasional 'hell' and such when it is used in proper 
57 context, but to use it purly to prove that you can say it is hardly
58 a way to get people to respect you, or read your entries. Also, you
59 will get your works rejected by every publisher I know, there are many
60 ways to express strong emotion and they can be very well written,
61 but all to often the young budding writter does a cop out, and uses
62 the simple language because it is easier. unfortunatly you loose a lot
63 of readers as a result. So please, yes enter stories here, but also,
64 remember the people to are telling them to, and tell the story in a way
65 they can enjoy. Believe me, they will respect you for it, and you'll
66 get a lot more praise and satisfaction as a result.
67 End of tirade.

72 written on Backwater. But, I think I liked the story better with the piece.
73 out of it. I thought it ended well, leaving some to one's imagination.

95    The polarized viewing windows began to darken as the orbiting station
96 aproached the daylight side of the Earth.  Ian Goldburg put down his pipe into
97 a half-filled ashtray as a group of travellers walked towards the comstations
98 that would transport them to the outer solar system in a matter of minutes.
99 Several men in three peice suits went to Ian's comstation number twelve.  They
100 were young, much younger than Ian and obviously much better off.  Ian returned
101 the pipe to his mouth.
102    "Where are you fellas headed?"
103    "Titan." answered one.
104    "Umm, Titan, just a sec." Ian checked his computer.  "The next open
105 connection to Titan will be in thirteen hours and twelve minutes."  The man
106 sighed and suggested to the others that they rent a movie or two.  He then
107 made the necessary arrangements with Ian.
108    "Five for Titan, billed to Softcom, Inc."
109    "Gotcha.  Okay, I'll be expecting you." Ian gave a polite smile and the man
110 left.  He looked at the people from his comstation and thought about what it
111 must have been like to travel before transcom.  People would spend months
112 travelling the short distance from the Earth to Titan, sometimes hibernating,
113 sometimes not.  Now people didn't have to travel at all.  Every single bit of
114 their body chemistry would be digitized and sent to Titan's station, where
115 they would be reassembled from the binary signal.  Even after all these years
116 working the Comstations, he still found it amazing.  He put down his pipe and
117 glanced at his watch.  It was already 12:10.  He left his station and went
118 home for the night.
119    When he returned the next day, the five men were already there.  The first
120 man went into the small chamber.  He went through the digitzing cycle quickly.
121 Everything went smoothly.  Ian received an OK message from Titan and he
122 elementized the man's body.  He ran the rest of the men through.  The last
123 man, obviously his first time through, asked Ian about the dangers of cancer.
124    "Oh, don't worry about that.  True, when Transcom first came out, there was
125 a high incidence of cancer, but now we send the signal through t7ice and Titan
126 compares the two.  If there are any differences between the two, we start the
127 process again.  Believe me, there's nothing to worry about."  The man seemed a
128 bit reassured, but still rather shakey.  He went through.  The five men had
129 been put through in only an hour.
130    Ian reached for his pipe, and realized that he had left it in his cabin.
131 He went back through the thin, bright passages to his cabin, but when he
132 returned something seemed very strang-----------
133 Ahhhh, able to upload at last!  Part 2 soon.
134 Darn, there are a few transfer errors in it.  Oh, well, such is life.

139     FLIP WATCHED AS THE CLOAKED FIGURE MADE HIS WAY THRU THE TREES, WORMING
140 HIS WAY UP THE HILL. IT WAS ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE DAWN, AND FLIP
141 WAS WIDE AWAKE, READY FOR THE NEW DAY IN THIS STRANGE WORLD. THE STRANGER
142 SLOWLY ENTER THE CAMP, HIS HANDS IN THE OPEN SO ONE COULD SEE THAT HE
143 DID NOT HOLD ANY WEAPONS. "HELLO, MY I WARM MYSELF BY YOUR FIRE?" HE ASKED
144 STANDING JUST OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT. "SURE, I COULD USE SOME COMPANY
145 ON THIS COOL MORNING." REPLIED FLIP, AS HE MOTIONED THE STRANGER CLOSER.
146 "WHAT MIGHT YOU NAME BE?" HE ASKED. "MY NAME IS TRILON, AND I COME FROM
147 THE VALLEY BELOW. ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY UP TO THE PRAYER STONE?" HE ASKED.
148 "ME, NO I AM TRAVELING DOWN TO THE VALLEY..." FLIP BARLEY SAID THIS WHEN
149 HE NOTICED THE STRANGERS FACE GO PALE. "NO ONE COMES DOWN FROM HERE, THE
150 GODS TAKE THOSE WHO CLIMB THIS HOLY MOUNTAIN!" WITH THAT SAID TRILON 
151 STARTED RUNNING UP THE HILL AWAY FROM FLIPS CAMP AS FAST AS HE COULD. 
152 "STRANGE..." THOUGHT FLIP AS HE WATCHED THE STRANGER DISAPPEAR INTO THE
153 TREES. "I MUST REMEMBER NOT TO TELL ANYONE I HAVE BEEN UP HERE...THAT
154 COULD ALSO EXPLAIN MY PREDICAMENT". 
155      AFTER CLEANING UP THE CAMPSITE (LEAVING LITTLE TRACE OF ITS BEING)
156 HE ADJUSTED HIS PACK AND SETOFF DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE AND TO THE LEFT, TO 
157 FOLLOW A STREAM THAT SEEMED TO FLOW INTO THE VALLEY. THE STRANGER AT THE
158 CAMP THE MORNING DIDN'T SEEM TO CARRY ANY WEAPONS, WHICH WAS ODD FOR ONE
159 HIKING AT NIGHT. NO MATTER, HE THOUGHT AS HE PICKED HIS WAY THROUGH THE
160 THICK UNDERBRUSH BY THE STREAM, LOOKING FOR TRACKS OF ANIMALS OR MAN,
161 WWHICH MIGHT HELP IN IN HIS JOURNEY. STOPPING ONLY FOR A LIGHT SNACK THAT
162 MORNING, HE CONTINUED ON DOWNSTREAM, LOOKING FOR A SUITABLE SITE FOR A
163 CAMP. THE STREAM HAD WIDEN ENOUGH FOR A SMALL RAFT TO PILOT ITS WAY DOWN
164 TTHE VALLEY. SETTING ABOUT TO MAKE HIS RAFT HE NOTICED THAT THERE SEEMED
165 TO BE ONLY BIRDS AND INSECTS ON THIS WORLD, BESIDES THE FISH IN THE 
166 CREEK, FOR HE HAD NOT SEEN ANY TRACKS OF SIGNS OF ANY AMINALS AT ALL
167 DURING THE MORNING. "THANK GOD FOR FISHHOOKS" HE THOUGHT AS HE DRAGGED
168 THE LOGS TO THE PILE. RUMMAGING THRU THE KIT HE PULLED OUT HIS TRUSTY
169 ROPE AND STARTED TO LASH TOGETHER THE LOGS FOR HIS RAFT. LATER, AFTER
170 HE FINISHED, HE FOUND A LONG BRANCH AND TRIMMED IT TO LENGTH FOR HIS
171 'PUSH POLE' TO HELP IN HIS JOURNEY DOWNRIVER. 
172      THE JOURNEY THAT DAY WENT UNEVENTFUL ACCEPT FOR THE RAPIDS HE
173 ENCOUNTER IN VARIOUS PARTS ON THE CREEK, WHICH HE ALMOST LOST ALL
174 THE GEAR HE CARRIED. FARTHER AND FARTHER HE WENT BUT STILL NO SIGN
175 OF HABITATION, WHICH SEEMED RATHER ODD  ON THIS BEAUTIFUL CREEK (WHICH
176 WAS SLOWLY TRANSFORMING INTO A RIVER THE FARTHER HE WENT). THE SURROUNDING
177 COUNTRYSIDE LOOKED THE SAME, TREES AND LITTLE BRUSH, MORE TREES AND MORE
178 TREES, THERE SEEMED TO BE NO END. LATER AT NIGHTFALL HE POLED THE RAFT
179 INTO A COVE AND BROKE CAMP. SINGING TO HIMSELF WHILE GATHERING WOOD,
180 AN OLD BOY SCOUT BALLAD CAME TO MIND. THIS BALLAD HELPED HIM TO REMEMBER
181 HOW TO BUILD A FIRE THE EASY WAY, AND IT ALWAYS WORKED. SINGING, HE
182 BROKE OFF THE DEAD LIMBS OFF THE TREES NEAR HIS CAMPSITE FOR HIS FIRE
183 WHEN HE SUDDENLY FELT A PRESENCE BEHIND HIM. SLOWLY TURNING HE LOOKED
184 UPON THE NEW VISTOR...

197 UNDERCOVER by John Silverman
198 (c) 1985 John Silverman
199 
200 Frank still couldn't believe this was happening. He stood against the
201 wall of the laundry room, shivering in his damp dishwasher's uniform,
202 with the rest of the surviving members of the hotel staff. Facing 
203 them were a dozen men dressed in olive-drab uniforms complete with
204 black ski masks, all armed with various sorts of submachine guns.
205 They were waiting.
206 
207 
208 From the events of the last hour, Frank had arrived at one inescapable
209 conclusion. He, and all his fellow co-workers, were going to die.
210 It was just too logical, given the situation. His heart thundered as he
211 furiously thought of some slim hope to cling to. Right at the edge 
212 of the crowd, by the washing machines, was a large yellow laundry 
213 cart, about as tall as Frank's waist, filled with filthy linen. It
214 was just large enough to hold him and was out of the gunmen's direct
215 line of sight.
216 
217 
218 He moved towards the cart, using the crowd to mask his movements.
219 The gunmen weren't watching too closely right now, anyway. Finally
220 he had his hands on the edge of the basket. nobody was looking his 
221 way at the moment and the gunmen were out of sight. He gripped the 
222 edge tighter and vaulted in, pulling several layers of smelly shets
223 over him. The lack of space forced him to curl up into a fetal
224 position. He settled down and waited.
225 
226 
227 An hour later he was beginning to fel like an idiot. A cramped one.
228 It was hot and stuffy in there and it didn't smell very nice, either
229 These sheets were pretty rank and he hoped he wasn't going to catch
230 some kind of disease off them. He was about to admit he was a hopeless
231 and climb back out when he heard the door open. A hushed silence fell
232 across the room and then the high, nasal voice of the terrorist's
233 leader rang out.
234 
235 
236 "This is the greatest day of your lives! All that we are doing, we are
237 doing for you! No more uneven distribution of wealth! No more poverty
238 and crime! No more restriction of personal freedoms by authority!"
239 
240 
241 Frank thought, this guy is totally off his rocker, or stoned. probably
242 both.
243 
244 
245 The leader continued, "The new revolution is beginning right now! And
246 your role in it shall be the most honorable of all! Since there are far
247 too many of you to be effectively contolled by the few of us, we must
248 find an alternative." Frank felt a chill run through him. the crowd was
249 beginning to catch on, too, as 
250 frightened mutterings reached his ears.
251 
252 
253 "Your names will go down in history as the first to give their lives
254 up to our great cause. You will be remembered with honor. GOD BLESS 
255 AMERICA!!"
256 
257 
258 And then they opened fire.
259 
260 
261 Unlike in the movies,  where sounds are toned down for viewer comfort,
262 twelve 9MM machine guns being fired simultaneously in an enclosed space
263 creates a noise beyond description. Frank jammed his fingers in his 
264 ears and still felt as though his eardrums were about to burst. The roar
265 covered everything, including the screams of the dying. The awful noise
266 went on and on until Frank thought he couldn't takey more. Then
267 it stopped.
268 
269 
270 He didn't know how long he had lain there, waiting for his hearing to
271 return. When it finally did, he tried to listen. Eventually, he decided
272 he was alone. There was an emergency fire door in the back of the room
273 He could escape that way, with a little luck. Tensing up, he tried to
274 ready himself. As he was about to make his move, he was frozen by the
275 sound of a bootheel scraping on the concrete floor nearby. They had left
276 somebody, probably to watch that fire door. Frank had just narrowly
277 missed revealing himself. He relaxed his muscles and tried to keep
278 from shaking. He was trapped.
279 
280 (To Be Continued....)
281  
282 JEEZ, WHAT A CHORE! IS THERE ANY WAY AT ALL OF DELETING LINES ALREADY
283 ENTERED? IF SO, THEN I COULD DOWNLOAD FROM MY WORD PROCESSOR AND DO
284 ALL MY TYPING OFFLINE. IF THE DOWNLOAD SCREWS UP, (LIKE IT DID BEFORE
285 THEN I COULD DELETE THE WHOLE MESSAGE AND TRY AGAIN, OR NOT TRY AGAIN.
286 ALSO, ALL MY WORK IS WRITTEN TO BE READ AND I KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN
287 I WRITE IT. (DID THAT COME OUT RIGHT?) ANYWAY, I NEVER USE
288 GRATUITOUS SEX, VIOLENCE, OR LANGUAGE IN MY WRITING (WELL, ALMOST NEVER)
289 ANYWAY, I'LL JUST KIND OF TAKE IT EASY ON THE HEAVY STUFF FOR A WHILE.
290 
291 I HOPE MY STORY MEETS WITH GENERAL APPROVAL FROM MY READERS.
292 ANYWAY, IT'S LATE SO I'LL LEAVE YOU FOR NOW...

303   John S -- Excellent!  The upload problem is solvable if you are a competent
304 programmer.  Most seem to go through some sort of personal crisis while 
305 getting their programs to work with BW.  Most commercial programs seem not
306 to work.  (with the exception of one sold by our esteemed host doing business
307 as U S Digital -- did I get that right, Mikey? or does copylink indeed work
308 with BW?)  About half of the partons seem to use some sort of uploading
309 program -- usually a home-brew of some sort.  I type my things in "raw"
310 and limit rewrites to a single line.  Some horrible things happen if I let
311 my fingers get ahead of my head, but we go through spates of "read only"
312 often enough that any other tactic often gets mangled.  When we're in
313 "all allowed" as lately, you can do a lot.  Try "help".
314   Walrus -- nice start.  Keep going, I'd like to see more.
315   Bigfoot -- I'm caught up in your story too.
316   All -- it seems that the cycle is turning again.  We seem to be moving to
317 individual rather than multi-author stories.  It's easier to plot out, but
318 misses some of the rather bizzare twist that the multi-author tales
319 sometimes take.

340 explosions of light sprawled across the midnight sky. I wish I was lying among
341 this burning light. I wish I could embrace the heavens.
342          There's a mysterious darkness hanging on the night. It gives hope, 
343 knowing that there's still some unknown and that there's something beyond the
344 day. The blue sky seems finite, but the night is expansive. It's a sense of
345 insured existence to think that there are no boundries. The thought that beyond
346 my sight there's nothingness is depressing. Nothing beyond does not put what's
347 here on a pedestal of importance, it makes everything seem valueless. Also...
348 the night is terrifying. It scourges comfort and security. It hold dangers,
349 enemies, and pain.

355      Salazar's fingers slowly applied pressure to his eyeballs.  He pushed
356 and then rubbed them as if that would relieve the stress that caused them
357 to blur.  His head pounded from lack of sleep and too much coffee, and the
358 muscles of his lower back and shoulders were tight from sitting too long.
359 "A curse on the family of whoever invented these private jets," he thought.
360 "Can't stand up straight, can't stretch out, but at least there aren't any
361 distractions when you need to get some work done.  Well, not too many."
362 His eyes drifted to his current distraction, busy in the back of the cabin
363 preparing a meal of sorts.  Salazar wondered again why Rommel had this
364 woman come with him on what looked to be an extremely dangerous job.
365 Granted she was efficient, and seemed to have a good grasp of what would be
366 needed, but once the arrangements had been made and the supplies purchased
367 she didn't seem to have a purpose.  At least an obvious purpose, Salazar
368 thought wryly.
369      "You're here to keep an eye on me, aren't you?" Salazar asked Anna as
370 she returned and spread the light meal she had prepared on the table.
371      "Whatever you say, Mr. Salazar." Anna answered.  "What would you like
372 to drink with your meal?"
373      "Just water, thank you, I've had enough coffee for now.  You didn't
374 answer my question.  Why are you here?  Doesn't Rommel trust me?  He knows
375 I have a personal interest in this affair too.  I'm not likely to just run
376 off with his money."
377      "We're aware of that, Mr. Salazar.  I may be of more use to you than
378 you think.  Don't judge me based on what you think you see.  You were
379 fooled the first time, too."  Anna finished with a smile.
380      Salazar smiled also as he remembered the middle-aged and rather
381 matronly woman he had first seen.  This woman, the same woman Salazar
382 reminded himself, was quite young and rather attractive in a quiet way.
383 Could be very attractive, he thought, if she'd only use a little make-up.
384 But then, could he trust what he saw even now?  As she had said, he'd been
385 fooled the first time too.  But Anna had noticed his frank appraisal of
386 her, and the smile had vanished as quickly as it had come.  Her cheeks
387 reddened slightly and she looked away.
388      "I know a great deal about you," she said angrily, "so I will thank
389 you to keep your leering to yourself!"
390      "I apologize, no offense was intended," Salazar said quietly, "and I
391 hope none was given.  Now, on to business.  It appears that we made a
392 serious mistake.  I was under the impression that the McKane organization
393 was involved, but sworn testimony to the contrary has eliminated that
394 possibility.  It now seems that what we're dealing with is a resurgent Nazi
395 or fascist organization, working together with some revolutionary left-wing
396 group composed of local Indian tribes.  I'm not sure whether to be relieved
397 or worried.  McKane's group was well funded and highly technological, but
398 it was not single minded.  They had a basic ethical and moral stance."
399 Salazar sighed and waved the documents he had been studying for the last
400 three hours.  "These people don't seem to have any morals at all, and their
401 ethics are based on simply getting whatever they want."
402      "Yes, and it looks like they're involved in genetic experimentation.
403 But why would they want Pam?"  Anna said, looking troubled.  "She doesn't
404 seem to have anything that would indicate a genetic makeup that they'd find
405 interesting.  Could it be something else?"
406      "That seems likely.  But finding out why she was taken isn't what
407 we're here for.  Getting her back is."  Salazar looked out the window and
408 saw nothing but cloud cover.  "Love the view."
409      "Anna, we'll be beginning descent in fifteen minutes," the voice of
410 the pilot said through the nearby speaker, "please prepare the passenger
411 area for landing."
412      Anna stood up and began clearing the table of the empty dishes.
413 Salazar looked at them in surprise, he hadn't paid the slightest attention
414 to his food as he ate it.  Oh well, Anna didn't seem to be the type to need
415 empty compliments on her cooking.
416      Salazar decided to use the head while he still could, and as he stood
417 up he cracked his head against the roof of the cabin.  "Damn tiny private
418 jets!" he mumbled.

470      For three days the wary elf had been tracking the solitary human.  Early
471 on he had almost walked up and greeted him, till he remembered ware he was.
472      Others of his kind had died for less.  Still not all humans represented
473 fear and danger.  Even on this, Dreamtoucher's home world, there were rumors
474 of elvish holts and human tribes liveng in peace and harmony.
475      Snowrunner had brushed forcefully up against his side on that occasion,
476 a warning which knowing cation to be the better part of valor, he was thankful
477 for.  For part of a day another human joined this one.  Dreamtoucher watched
478 quietly from concealment.
479      Time, though, had finaly proven this one a streinger to the world of two
480 moons.  Not a streinger to living of the land however.  He was well fed and 
481 healthy.  He was now alone.
482      The elven mystic and his four footed companion steped forward into the
483 clearing.  The human looked up.  His eyes showed neither fear nor enmity.
484      The human held his hands open, palm forward.  Dreamtoucher did the same.
485      'A fine night full of stars' He spoke in the human's tounge, by way of 
486 greeting.  Beside him Snowrunner sniffed every olfactory neuance but showed no
487 sign of anxiety.  Noting this the elf relaxed perceptably himself.

491 UNDERCOVER (Part 2)
492 By John Silverman
493 
494 Frank didn't know know how long he had been there, but he did know one
495 thing for sure: he had to go to the bathroom. As far as he knew, the 
496 guard was stil there, watching the door. Frank had no choice. He shuddered
497 as he felt the warm wetness soak into the sheets. He hadn't done that
498 since he was a little boy. From all indications, things were going to get
499 a hell of a lot worse before they got any better. At least his cramped
500 muscles were beginning to go numb. That was a blessing.
501 
502 The fear had faded to a low level tension that allowed him to assess
503 his situation rationally. His options, at the moment, were none. He tried
504 to figure out why this had to happen to him.
505 
506 The day had started out normal enough. He came in at four and was greeted
507 by the biggest pile of dirty pans and dishes he had seen in a long time.
508 This was compounded by the news that his help had called in sick so
509 Frank would be working the night alone. Crap. Cursing the lazyass morning
510 crew, he punched his timecard and started in on the mess.
511 
512 By six he was almost caught up when the machine ran out of soap. Still
513 grumbling, he stomped into the storeroom to get more. A new shipment had
514 come in and it took ten minutes of rummaging to find where the morning crew
515 had put it. They enjoyed finding imaginative hiding places for the stuff,
516 driving the night crew nuts in the process.
517 
518 As he walked out he was grabbed roughly by the collar and pushed against
519 the wall next to the door. The entire kitchen staff was lined up along
520 that wall, hands on heads, covered by three very big guys with guns.
521 Moments later a fourth one came up and said, "That's all of 'em." One
522 of the gunmen started motioning the captives towards the service entrance.
523 
524 Frank's department head, Chef Bob, was not known for his discretion. He
525 went up to the lead gunman and started to chew him out. "Now just a minute!
526 I demand to know-" was as far as he got before being cut almost in half by
527 a burst of 9MM slugs. Blood spattered the gleaming kitchen instruments. The
528 body fell to the floor and twitched a few times before becoming still.
529 
530 Bob had made an excellent example. Nobody made the slightest resistance as
531 they were herded out the door. They were taken down to the laundry room
532 where they were greeted by the rest of the night staff and more gunmen.
533 
534 Frank was jolted out of his reminiscing by the sound of that boot scraping
535 again, a little closer this time. How could the guy stand it down here
536 with all those bodies? Frank wondered what would happen if he was caught.
537 Probably shoot him on the spot. Or maybe take one of those big hunting
538 knives they carried and use them, taking time to enjoy themselves. He
539 didn't doubt they would do that. He shuddered and tried to think of 
540 something else.
541

544 WHEN I FINALLY MANAGED TO GET ON THIS BOARD, I WAS SO TIRED THAT I 
545 INTENDED TO JUST LOOK OVER THE MESSAGES AND GO TO BED. HOWEVER, WHEN I SAW
546 THE SYSTEM JUST WENT FOEEY ON ME AGAIN. I DON'T ENEN KNOW IF WHAT I AM 
547 TYPING IS LEGIBLE. I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO CUT IT SHORT. AT LEAST I GOT ALL
548 MY STORY DOWN THIS TIME. THANKS MUCH FOR THE PRAISE AND I'LL CHECK BACK
549 TOMORROW.

614 Gee, at the bottom again.  Once again I have found the time to visit
615 but the room is limited.  I think the french say it best:
616      "Such is life",  which of cource is quite a statement in itself.
617 I am sorry toward the orange juice and cheese muffin people who came
618 over the other night, I was not in a very reseptive mode since I was not
619 prepared for any company, let along at that time of night when I have to
620 be at work at 6:30am.  I've not been getting much sleep on this schedule
621 due to unexpected foils like that but then, whatelse is new?  The play
622 in Oregon City HS was nice.  I do like musicals like that.  Boy next week
623 will be an interesting weekend.  But then, only about half of the people who
624 are coming over are backwater people so nuff said.  Well, I had better go
625 find something to do, Its MOTHERS DAY you know.  With my moms and my 
626 bithdays so close no time to party.  Bye all, until later ~~~ PaPa Smurf
