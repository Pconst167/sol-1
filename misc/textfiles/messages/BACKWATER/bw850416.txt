21      To say that I am surprised at finding myself forced into the backseat
22 of a car would be an example of incredible understatement.  Stunned,
23 shocked, outraged, and perhaps frightened would certainly describe my
24 mental state at the moment, but despite my condition I quickly gain an
25 impression of my surroundings and of the other occupants of the automobile.

26      The man who had extended the rather rough "invitation" to enter the
27 car sits on my right between me and the door.  He is clean shaven, and
28 though his hair is gray I can tell that he had been blonde when he was
29 younger.  He is dressed in a conservative suit, tie, and shoes, and he
30 looks as if he has made every effort to appear nondescript.  When I turn to
31 my left I am met with the sight of an individual who is the antithesis of
32 my captor.  His skin is a healthy nut-brown, his hair cut looks as if
33 someone had placed a bowl over his head and trimmed around the sides, and
34 there is a sickly green slime running from his nostrils to his chin.  In
35 his hand is what appears to be a knife made out of the jawbone of some poor
36 creature, its incisors sharpened to a point.  His eyes have a dull gleam to
37 them, as though he is in a drugged state.  I can only see the back of the
38 driver's head, but he seems to be of the same type as the knife-wielder.

39      It's odd how the mind works under stress.  I am far from calm, but a
40 portion of my mind seems to view the entire affair as if I wasn't part of
41 it, a spectator.  I mentally run through a series of jokes and puns about
42 my situation, and then name my captors.  My knife bearing friend becomes
43 Moe (of the 3 Stooges) because of his haircut, while Mr. 3-Piece Suit
44 becomes Siegfried.  Unfortunately, that portions of my mind isn't in
45 control.

46      "Wha... wha... wha... what are you doing?" I stammer.

47      "Ooooooh!  Porky Pig, right?" Moe giggles oddly, "I just luuuve Looney
48 Tunes!"

49      "Quiet," Siegfried orders, "driver, airport.  Kaobawa, establish
50 cellular communications with Portland contact, transmit coded message for
51 successful completion of primary goal."  He then turns to me and smiles.
52 He has disgustingly thin lips and his smile is cruel.  His eyes don't
53 smile.  "I hope we haven't... inconvenienced you my dear.  I'm afraid that
54 you have an unscheduled appointment to keep.  But don't worry, you'll
55 travel in style.  Cargo class.  Kaobawa...?"

56      Suddenly I feel a sharp pain in my left arm, and I turn to see Moe
57 smiling strangely at me as he begins to put a syringe back into a small
58 case.  My vision begins to tunnel, and a roaring sound seems to fill the
59 air around me.  As I lose consciousness the last thing I hear is Moe's
60 voice.

61      "Th...Th...Th...That's all, folks!" he laughs.

94 Sangrion was a strange place, but Melopul considered it home.  The
95 long, dimly illuminated passageways of the underground world were all
96 that he knew.  It was his job, and many others' also, to defend their
97 home against the many invaders form the surface that attacked from
98 timt to time.  The outside world was considered uninhabitable by the
99 people of Sangrion, and many often died trying to repair breaches in 
100 the walls surrounding their home.
101   Melopul was twenty zirecs old, a young member of the Life Patrol, He
102 had benn patrolling the corridors of his home since his first zirec, 
103 and he had been fortunate enough to some out of his first few battles
104 unscathed.  But many of his fellow Patrollers had been killed in the 
105 recent battles, and he did not know how soon it would be until he 
106 joined their ranks.  
107   This particular day Melopul was patrilling the passageways near the
108 outside world.  Thousands of the working class Sangrionians, indentifiable
109 by there noricably striking red garments, streamed past him, carrying
110 food and other supplies, or containers of waste products with them.  
111 Nelopul was outfitted in white, as befitted a member of the Patrol,
112 and he wore his uniform proudly.  As he went along, he could see other
113 members of the Patrol ahead and behind him, as they too watched the
114 outer walls and busy corridors.

122     "You gotta give old Conrad Hilton some credit though. At least his joints
123 don't look like Motel 6!" Fellows was beginning to sound like a broken
124 comedy record. The only time he wasn't joking around was when he was asleep.
125     "Farley, hail us another cab." Parity directed. "Yell when it arrives,
126 and keep it there until we come out. Fellows, I want a word with you."
127     Farley did as he was told. Cabs were pretty popular this time of day,
128 and the tip would make the cabbie's wait worthwhile.
129     "Well Parity, what's up? Are you going to scold me for being too jovial?
130 Am I in the dog house?"
131     "You know me better than that. I realize you are trying to use humor with
132 Farley so he will feel better aut the situation. You can stop being so
133 funny all the time though. It can get in the way if it becomes habit."
134     "Yes sir!" Fellows bellowed, and then followed with an appropriate salute.
135 "Just kidding..."
136     "Did you notice the make on that bug Farley found?"
137     "Yes sir!" Fellows bellowed, and then followed with an appropriate salute.
138 "Just kidding..."
139     "Did you notice the make on that bug Farley found?"
140     "Yea. It's the kind that P.A.I.N. used to deploy back in the seventies.
141 Good old PAIN. Boy we used to really pun it up when they were around. I
142 thought we scrubbed them plenty good. What do you think it means?"
143     Before Parity could answer, Farley broke in with the news that a cab had
144 finally decided stop instead of running him over. 
145     "We'll be right there." Parity called after him.
146     "Do we tell our junior agent about the new card in the deck?" Fellows
147 mused.
148     "No need to worry him unnecessarily. Let's find miss Lamb, and take care

154      Sam was getting a little tired of tailing the two cars.  He
155 had been following them for quite some time now, and was still
156 no closer to discovering any new information on the situation.
157 After being assigned to Deus Ex Machina by NET 01 himself, he
158 had driven around the central Portland area trying to spot
159 any thing that seemed stranger than the usuall strange things
160 that happend in downtown Portland.  He had finnaly seem a car
161 matching the description given to NET by an as yet unidentified
162 informant.  All he had been told was that NET had learned that
163 members of a Nazi-like group were in the area and that someone
164 had hinted they were going to try to kidnap someone by the name
165 of 'Pam'.  He wasn't sure, but thought it likely that that was
166 the person he had been being pulled into the car before it shot
167 away from the downtown area.  Since he had started after the
168 car, he noticed that there was another car also trailing it.
169 He wasn't sure who this guy was either, but would wait and find
170 out before taking any action.  He hoped something happend soon,
171 since he wanted to be able to report more than that he had been
172 following a car all this time.  Well, he would wait...

209 The follow
210 Sorry about the above...rotten 'ENTER ONLY'...
211 The following is not a regular entry...
212      
213      There I was, dressed in my rented tuxedo, staring at 
214 myself in the mirror...'My God', I thought, 'I've definitely
215 seen better days...'  Anyway, I combed my hair and left to 
216 picjck up my date Amber.  Then I slowly remembered that I was 
217 also driving Shawn there.  I swung by Shawn's, picked him up,
218 and proceeded to Amber's house.  On the way I almost forgot 
219 the corsage!!  I kicked myself then went to get it.  We 
220 finally arrived, about on time (sort of...), and I couldn't 
221 believe my eyes!  There stood Amber dressed in this flowing 
222 white dress.  I had NEVER seen her look so good, and promtly
223 told her so.  We then climbed into our (ha ha ha) chariot,
224 and took off for the Jade West resteraunt in Portland.  We 
225 arrived half an hour late.  We had a delicious Oriental dinner
226 then proceeded to the highlight of the evening...THE PROM!!
227 We arrived at the Wilsonville Holiday Inn at 9:30pm and were
228 we shocked...the super great prom that we paid $5.00/ticket
229 for was a letdown.  After the Prom was over, about 12am, we 
230 left.  Since Amber had to be in by 1am we didn't have much 
231 time after the prom...feeling a bit rejected by a girl 
232 named LISA FULLER (choke) I asked Amber if I could share
233 her waterbed with her.  I promised that I wouldn't try any-
234 thing, but I guess that she knew better than I thought...
235 All in all, it was a greatyt night (I have finally just recovered
236 from it...).  If you thought this was a boring entry (and 
237 evening) just try to put down, in writing, something like this
238 that sounds exciting...

252     "Do we tell our junior agent about the new card in the deck?" Fellows
253 mused.
254     "No need to worry him unnecessarily. Let's find miss Lamb, and take care
255 of this Kosta deal. I am worried enough about that part of the mission. If
256 PAIN intends to butt in, things might get a bit sticky. I assume you packed
257 the necessary equipment?"
258     "Oh of course. Never leave home without one."
259     "OK...let's go for a ride. You go on out, I want to make a phone call."
260 %$#%#$%
261     "The address is 719 Pike street. A nice leisurely ride please?" Parity
262 told the driver. "We want to take in the sights of your beautiful city."
263     "Shore is nice this time a year ain't it?" The cabbie was obviously
264 proud to be called a San Franciscian.
265     "Shore is..." Fellows laughed. "Shore is. Reminds me of the time..."
266     Farley cut in before Fellows could regale all with another one of his
267 lengthy stories. "Is that Lamb's address?"
268     "No Eugene. That's the Bay Area office. Actually it is just a store fron,
269 but we need to pick up some equipment Ian sent down to us."
270     "Uh...should we be talking 'out loud' like this?" Farley was motioning a
271 the driver. "And what about the walls having ears?"
272     "Don't worry Farley, already checked out." Fellows produced a small devie
273 from his sport coat pocket. Farley recognized it as NET issue bug detection
274 equipment. "As for the driver, YOU aren't listening to us are you?"
275     "Huh?"   
276     "We check these things out Farley." Parity assured. "But I'm glad you ar
277 keeping on your toes. Now settle back and enjoy the ride. Things will be
278 getting sticky soon enough."
279     "Soon enough." Farley echoed.

283 Farley:AP English was invented by someone who figured that highschool students
284 who wanted to work hard deserved saving a few bucks when they got a 3, 4, or
285 5 on the AP test. Imagine entering college with as many as 6 hours of English,
286 6-9 hours of math, 3 hours of History, and 3 hours of Chemistry. All of this
287 is before even setting foot in the door. That's what AP English is for. When
288 you look back on your class, you'll be glad you did it, and you can give
289 yourself a well-deserved pat on the back. Keep reading and writing!

356 	The above seemed appropriate at tax time. It is an SCA song about the
357 time ( a few years back), when the BOD decreed that memberships were going
358 to cost more and that you had to be a member or you couldn't (see attached
359 LONG list....). If you let your membership lapse, well milord, I'm sorry
360 but you no longer have ANY of those titles... 
361 	A compromise was worked out, but there was a revival of an old joke 
362 from the LAST time the BOD had gotten 'out-of-hand'. 
363 "I hear that the Board of Directors wants to change their name."
364 "Oh? Why?"
365 "They want something that matches their opinion of themselves."
366 "What are they changing it to?"

372      Even as the three friends at the inn were about to introduce themselves
373 to THOR, Themnax, in his fully cloaked Lananaran singleship was crusing south,
374 away from the Portland metro area.
375      I hope Ian knows about the tap, Themnax thought to himself, he probably
376 does, he HAS to.  Oh well, x(n) has more to worry about then that, besides, 
377 this is as much in NET's intrest as it is the H.U.B.'s.  He then reached out
378 and typed a complicated set of instructions into the lananaran keyboard built
379 into the single-ship's console.
380      When he hit <exec>, all the reports to NET hq pertaining to both recent
381 abductions dumped passed on an auxiliary screen and directly into cindi, his
382 ship's onboard inteligence.  
383      'scaning now for those three cars, its voice informed him.  'that fine, 
384 keep an eye on them' was his informal command to the system.
385      Touching another (short this time) sequince of keys and ajusting a few 
386 controls, his NET tap healed itself back to invisable dormancy.
387      meanwhile, the chase below continued.  'I wonder' themnax mused to himself,
388 if those two seperate abductions might actualy be one and the same,  they seam

395   --Sometimes getting back to continue a story is difficult... when I can't
396 get on, I lose the thread.  Oh well, the piper was having his fortune told
397 via the Tarot and seemed to be losing conciousness.
398   The piper had a vagrant thought, something about the world turning entirely
399 black and hugging him to keep him warm, when the scene began to clear.  He
400 became first concious of the fact that he was no longer at the inn, unless --
401 no, he was definitely not at the inn -- large horses were most certainly not
402 welcome within the walls and this horse whith which he was nose-to-nose
403 was certainly one of the largest he had ever seen.
404   "And just where did YOU come from?"  The voice was accompanied by a metallic
405 clash.
406   Looking upward, the piper became aware of the horse's rider.  Covered in
407 uncomfortable-looking plate mail, he seemed immense.
408   "Well, never mind that now.  I need a service."  The clash came again as
409 the figure leaned forward, a black plume drooping from the crest of the helmet.
410   "Take this cup," he extended a silver flagon in one greaved hand.  "And
411 dip me a cool drink from the stream.  I'm about to drop of thirst and if
412 I get off this horse, I'll never make it back on."

415   Melopul streamed past the place where the red workers, one by one,
416 gathered thier food and supplies, and followed tham as they carried 
417 thier loads toward the center of the city.  Then he headed for the main
418 checkpoint.  Every Sangrionian passed through these mighty walls as they
419 were assigned new destinations.  He followed the swarm of workers as
420 they passed through an area near an opening to the surface, where the
421 workers collected valuable supplies that were deposited there by strange
422 and unknown forces working in the outer world.
423   Then, as he went through as area that was close to the surface, he 
424 heard a cry arise from ahead, and rushed forward past the workers to
425 find out what was going on.  He found a horde of attacking enemies
426 slaughtering the workers, while a few Patrollers were attempting to hold
427 them off. Melopul rushed forward and joined in the struggel.
428    The white Patrollers surrounded each invader, one by one, and killed
429 it, though one or more of the defenders were inevitably lost. Their only
430 hope lay in their far greater numbers. But the main invading force
431 pressed on, and Melopul found himself being pushed back.  He moved over
432 to a wall moniter and flicked it on.
433   "All Life Patrollers." he cried. "We're under attack in Sector Five!
434 Come quickly!!!" Then one of the incaders came after him and he
435 turned to fight.........

442 P.B:  Your upload problem appears to be that you aren't using a long enough end-
443 of-line delay.  It's necessary to wait about 1 second after each CR sent.  (With
444 some modems--such as mine--an intercharacter delay is also needed, but you don't
445 seem to miss characters except at the start of the line).  I hope your software
446 can be made to do this.  Also, be sure to type BOTTOM just before you type
447 ENTER.  There was some good information about this on the disks about 10 days
448 ago, but I guess there's no way for you to get a copy.

527   Isis -- I'm sure the problem is not the fault of the reader -- rather the
528 piper seems to get much too far into these things.  Imagine, if you will,
529 giving a reading, then seeing your client begin to fade.  Now look at the card..
530   The piper looked up at the black-plumed knight, then stepped around his
531 huge horse and reached up for the cup.  The knight had raised his visor and 
532 looked down at the piper from cool, blue eyes, a wisp of light brown hair
533 escaping from the cruel iron of his helmet to be toyed with by the light breeze.
534   "Thank you.  I am in your debt."  The voice was clear and level, although
535 somehow it held overtones of exhaustion.
536   With a smile, the piper took the cup and turned to find the stream this
537 knight had mentioned.
538   For the first time, the piper became more aware of his surroundings than
539 of his compainion.  They stood on a plain between the foothills of a mountain
540 range on one hand and a meandering river valley on the other.  Bare of trees
541 and habitation, the plain stretched on, an endless ribbon belting between
542 river and mountains.  It was late afternoon, the sun had lost its afternoon
543 heat, leaving memories behind in the smell of the dust.  To the east, toward
544 the river, the land fell off into a narrow bottom that contained the river,
545 then rose again to a plain on the other side of the broad valley.  In the
546 distance, low foothills heaved themselves out of the plain to stand attendance
547 to another mighty range of mountains, their icy crowns proclaming their
548 sovreignity over the vast distances beyond.
549   The nearby river cut a large arc around where the knight and the piper now
550 stood.  Small ravines cut into the plain, deepening down to the river bottom.
551 The piper started down one of these, hoping to come across a stream before he
552 reached the river, but willing to walk some distance if necessary.
553   Towards the bottom of the ravine, the piper came across traces of the passage
554 of a large number of men and horses.  Following this track, the piper soon
555 came upon what remained of those who had left the tracks.  First, the corpse
556 of a tall man, bloodstained where the haft of a spear protruded from him
557 gave warning as the piper began to crest a small hill.  Sick at heart, the
558 piper somehow knew what sight would lay before him as he pressed his weary
559 steps onward.
560   The sights and smells of violent death are not for the weak of stomach.  We
561 place a value on life -- a value that is trampled into the earth, defecated
562 upon, and ridiculed in the aftermath of a battle.  The constant buzzing of
563 flies in this grim abbatoir sends a gay hum over the red and grey of the
564 colorful scene.  The red of spilled and congealed blood is everywhere --
565 saturating the clay of the earth beyond satiation -- forming a reddish-black
566 jelly that clings to the boots, making the footing on the blood-soaked clay
567 slippery and treacherous.  Figures are lying everywhere, some clasped in 
568 that last cold intimacy of the dance that led to their death, their swords
569 and spears like the discarded instruments of some crazy orchestra that has
570 just stepped out for a break.  Here a young man smiles, as if at a clever
571 joke, his sightless eyes surveying the ruin of what used to be his chest and
572 abdomen, there the intestines of two enemies intertwine in an intimacy that
573 goes far beyond anything that could be achieved in life.
574   Slowing only enough to be sure that none of the participants in this vast
575 pavanne of death still clung to life, the piper hurried on in search of water.

578    P.B.: I am not familiar with A.E.--I have a TRS-80 and have written all
579 my own software.  Since you seem to have solved the intercharacter delay
580 problem, you don't need the hints other people placed here about how to get
581 one (I did not try them, as my own software has the delay capability.)  The
582 main information you missed was from Cistop Mikey about WHY intercharacter
583 delays are sometimes necessary (it has to do with modem characteristics) and
584 WHY the end-of-line delay is necessary.  BW writes each line to disk when
585 the CR is received, and it's got to find the right place on the disk, which
586 takes time.  When you get near the bottom of the disk, one second isn't
587 enough unless you use BOTTOM just before ENTER, which postions the head at
588 the end of the drive before the first line has to be written.
589    Cistop Mikey:  Please enlighten me about what happened when I uploaded
590 yesterday!  I printed out my capture buffer.  My upload procedure was no
591 different from usual and the MA 120 shows before BOTTOM, yet the first 7
592 lines were rejected on the first try.  There are prompts in front of them
593 and also strange letters between some lines: e.g. FL F, TS NE NY, and TROL
594 HNEO LOE.  Uploading the same text immediately thereafter (having typed MA
595 120 and BOTTOM again) produced no such problem.  What am I overlooking?
