 61               Lately, when I read the newspaper, a scene from the
 62          movie "Aliens" will begin to play inside my head.  After a
 63          hard day of battling the bloodthirsty, parasitic aliens, the
 64          heroine of the film is tucking a little girl into bed.  The
 65          child is the lone survivor of an alien-ravaged settlers
 66          colony. "My mommy always told me there WERE no monsters...
 67          no real ones. But there are," the little girl says
 68          mournfully.  "Why do they tell little kids that?"  Good
 69          question.  The answer, as I recall, was "Most of the time its
 70          true," as good a response as could be expected.
 71  
 72               More and more, its beginning to feel like I'm in that
 73          movie, struggling to accept the reality that there are,
 74          indeed, monsters at the gate.
 75  
 76               In New York City, a twelve year old boy is set on fire
 77          for refusing to smoke crack. In Washington state, a six year
 78          old boy's penis is cut off with a hunting knife because he
 79          is too frightened to comply with his attacker's demand to
 80          urinate on him. In Oregon, Dana Brussard is disciplined to
 81          death as the other Ecclesia children are assembled to watch.
 82          The Central Park jogger case. Westley Allen Dodd.
 83  
 84               Is there even a shred of humanity anywhere in the
 85          beings who perpetrate these things?  A pathologist would
 86          confirm that they are Homo sapiens. A neurologist might find
 87          some brain damage.  A psychiatrist could suspect childhood
 88          trauma. Maybe so. But what defines them as human beings?
 89          What is the qualifier?
 90  
 91               Historians will be quick to cite atrocities through the
 92          ages, but maybe the 20th century is the one that has finally
 93          gone and done it; finally hit upon the right combination of
 94          greed, fear, family breakdown, lack of community or societal
 95          belonging, lack of opportunity, lack of hope...all steeped in
 96          environmental poison and the ready availability of conscience
 97          crippling drugs and fearsome weaponry...to produce a strain
 98          of Homo sapiens that is no longer human.
 99  
100               The second someone says something like that, though, the
101          specter of genocide is usually trotted out. "So who gets to
102          make the distinction?" one is always asked, "Who separates
103          the monsters from the human beings? You? Hitler had the same
104          general idea, you know."
105  
106               I know he did. And no, I don't have a solution. I'd be
107          pretty wary of anybody who claimed they did. I just can't
108          seem to shake the sense that something has shifted.
109          Evolutionary, maybe. Some kind of species-wide allergic
110          reaction. Human kind eating itself alive. Evil. Whatever.
111  
112               Now, though, if my kid asks me if there are any REAL
113          monsters, of course I'll say "No, there aren't." But I'll
114          know that it's just one of the lies we tell little kids.

232 Anybody here know anything about monitors?  Specificly, 19 inch color 
233 multi-sync monitors?  I picked a couple up REAL CHEAP this weekend, and
234 I'm trying to figure out what I need to do to get them to work.  They are
235 made by ikagami.  I havn't found a date on them yet.  They weigh abut
236 65 pounds each, come in white steel casses with black trim around the screen.
237 They have a degauss button in the lower right hand corner, as well as a
238 brightness control.  In back they have 10 connectors, Red,Green,Blue and
239 H Sync and V Sync in and out.  The connectors are the same as the ones used
240 in thin ethernet.
241  
242 Heres the problem.  The horizontal sync doesn't seem to do anything on either
243 monitor.  There is a switch inside the case that turns internal sync on and
244 off, but either way makes no difference either.  By messing around with the
245 internal H-sync controll I can get things to the point were they only roll on
246 at a very slow rate when taking input from a VGA card in 80x25 text mode.  
247 about 8 to 12 bits are invisible as well to the left.  
248  
249 I only had three connectors, so I only had one or later two of the three colors
250 hooked up when I was doing this. Could that be causing the sync problems?  
251  
252 Any help will be greatly appreciated.  Oh, anybody know what I'd have to do
253 to connect one of these things to a VCR?
254  
255 BTW,  I know about the HIGH voltages in these things and am very carefull.

267 Manipulating the Press By Dan Hellinger
268  
269      Conservatives seem to be convinced that the press is biased
270 against U.S. policies in Central America.  Recent reports of CIA,
271 State Department, and Pentagon manipulation of the news media
272 indicate that just the opposite is true.
273  
274      A Post-Dispatch article on Oct. 6, "Report Discloses
275 Propaganda To Aid Contras" drescribed a special office within the
276 State Department that produced "white propaganda" on behalf of
277 Reagan's Central America policy.  To rally support for the
278 Contras and discredit critics, they planted phony news articles
279 under Contra authorship and "independent" reports by experts who
280 were really in their pay.
281  
282      Another article in the Post (Oct. 5; originally in the
283 Boston Globe) describes ow a team of CIA and Army specialists in
284 psychological operations were assigned to the State Department's
285 Office of Public Diplomacy to generate a political propaganda
286 campaign.  Psychological operations are a major factor in the
287 designs of "low intensity war" planners.  What this report shows
288 is that techniques originally conceived to win "hearts and minds"
289 of peasants in Central America have been readily adapted for use
290 at home.
291  
292      The House Foreign Affair Committee listed an intricate
293 network of organizations, including the National Security Council
294 and the Office of Latin American Public Diplomacy.  The NSC
295 placed government-funded columns in major newspapers; arranged
296 press interviews with Contra leaders by government surrogates who
297 were not identified as such, book speaking engagements for
298 administration advocates, and placed large amounts of govenrment-
299 sponsored material in college libraries.
300  
301      Susan J. Cunningham, in her letter to the Post on Oct. 14,
302 praises the Post for printing these reports and asks a very
303 pertinent question:  "If U.S. reporters know that the press
304 releses they are receiving are phony, why do they continue to
305 print them?"   This is a worthy question.  Whatever the personal
306 biases that reporters might have about policy, they can hardly
307 serve the public interest unless they adopt a much more
308 aggressive and independent posture toward government propaganda.

332                  THE TEN MOST COMPELLING UFO CASES IN HISTORY
333                      in order of compellingness(?)
334  
335     1. "Hudson Valy"o he Westchester Wing, NY 1984        S5/P5
336     Thousands of reports, mostly nocturnal, of larg,sln,hovering
337   object with series of rotating lights. Reports came from many highly
338     rdbeidividuals including meteorologists, news reporters, and
339     police chiefs. "Planes in frain hory still in contention;
340     however, videos taken by area resident of both the objectada
    formation 
341     toti ay.
342  
343     2. "Cash/Landrum", outside Houston, TX 1979                 S5/P5
344     Two ladies and 5-year-old boy report diamond-shaped object belching
345     fire from eet,srounded by CH-47-style helicopters. Soon after
346     sighting, all three suffered strange aaiswih were likened to
347     radiation poisoning. Klass explains as hoax, saying that the witness'
348     pre-sighting medical conditions were not released to him for
349   eamination.
350  
    3. "Roswell Incident," outside Corona, NM 1947              S5/P5
351     Object crashed in remote location on a large ranch in early July, 1947.
352     Debris recovered byAF h issued hasty press release saying "Flying
353     Disk" had been recovered. Press release rerce h ext day, and
354     press conference held at which it was revealed the object was, in fact,
355   aRwnsne( eice used to calibrate radar). 30 years later, AF
356     intelligence officer Maj. J. Mare limed that the object was "not of
357     this earth", that the press conference was a sham. Interviews ihoe
358     150 witnesses reinforce anomalous nature of object.
359  
360   4 "Army Helicopter", Mansfield, OH 1974                    S5/P5
361     Four National Guardsman badBl H-1H chopper report sighting
362    large nocturnal object on collision course. Pilot-in-Command Capt.
363     Coyne puts chopper in descent mode. Object stops in front of chopper,
364     then continues westward travel, after which Coyne discovers that
365     chope culyrse 2000 ft. Klass' explanation of a bolide is not
366     supported by testimony, circumstne,o centific principles.
367  
368  nwtr, edlesham Forest, UK 1979                 S5/P4
369   Tre separate sightings of anomalous lights near a NORAD base in the
370     UK. Official reportfldb deputy base commander, who also taped the
371     on-site investigation carried out by Air Police deahet. Occurence
372     produced many witnesses, some of whom swear a craft was sighted. Invest-
373     igation hampered by conflicting testimony, Britain's Secrets Act, grand-
374     standing byoels hn credible witness, and possibly the "Control
375     Group" -- A US Senator began looking int h far, but abruptly halted
376     and would not communicate further with UFO researchers. 
377  
    6. "Washington Invasion," Washington, DC 1952               S4/P5
378    Several fast-moving objects appear on radarscopes at three separate
379     installations,icluding Andrews AFB. Interceptors scrambled, but don't
380   find anything. Same thing happens the next night, this time objects
381     confirmed by gron bevr. Largest peace-time press conference in
382     govt. history called to epan to reporters that radar traces were
383     caused b hrmal inversions, despite absence of proper weather
384     conditions ntenights in question.
385 
    7. "Great al Film", Great Falls, MN 1954                 S4/P5
386     Little Leagu aeball coach films two objects streaking across sky
387   na n AFB. Original explanation was that objects were F-100s on
388     approach to AFB, but photo-anlsssosobjects to be travelling much
389     too fast.
390  
391  
    8. "Trent Photo", McMinnville, OR 1950                      S5/P4
392     Actually two photos taken by farmer with Polaroid camera, depict
393     classic domed saucer. Foerudojects provide good references for
394     analysis, which shows object to be around 30 ft. diamtr n t least
395     1/4 mile distant. Shadows on foreground structure may be icnitn
396     with time of day provided by photographer; hwver, that is immaterial
397     to analysis of the imagessz and distance.
398  
399     9. Santiago, Chile, 18                                  S4/P5
400     Large object a igh altitude sighted by over 3 million Chileans,
401     includin  ie television audience. Slim possibility that object
402    was a weather balloon that had passed over two days earlier, but
403     newspaprpblished photos of both for comparison. Objects were
404     very dissmlr
405  
406   1. Kanazawa, Japan, 1989                                    S5/P4
407   Home video by Japanese businessman shows Saturn-shaped object
408     cruising around, stopping short rping, then taking off, all in
409     clear daylight. Foreground objects provide decent reference. Video
410     has "look" and "feel" of reality - several attempts at focusing,
411     unsteady camerawor,ec bject gives definite impression of great
412   dsace, although it is impossible to get an accurate measurement
413     with video. Still under analysis.

488 A Brief History of the Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula  
489  
490 By Steve Goldfield Insight Features 
491  
492    In its precolonial period, the Arab shore of the Gulf had small seaports 
493 which frequently moved from place to place. Many of these ports housed people 
494 engaged in shipping, often called pirates by their rivals, such as the 
495 British. 
496  
497    Iran had a large textile industry and also a large shepherd population.  
498 Oman had a large shipping empire, with about 2,000 ships traveling about the 
499 Indian Ocean from what is now Indonesia to Zanzibar (which was an Omani colony 
500 until 1962--another story for another time).  
501  
502    The people of the rest of the peninsula were mainly engaged in subsistence 
503 agriculture, largely Bedouin grazing of camels and other animals in the north 
504 and some settled farming, especially of cereals and dates, in the south, 
505 especially in the mountains of northern Yemen and southern Oman (Dhofar), 
506 where there are significant Monsoon rains. In Yemen, this agriculture was 
507 largely based on share cropping. 
508  
509 The Colonial period 
510  
511    The British entered the region in the early nineteenth century on their way 
512 to India, the prize of the British colonial empire. The British had machine-
513 produced textiles, which undermined and destroyed the Iranian textile 
514 industry, and later steamships, which did the same to the Omani shipping 
515 industry. 
516    The British were bothered by the pirates, their competitors. So they 
517 imposed agreements by military force with the families ruling the Gulf coastal 
518 tribes (up to that point they had been chosen fairly democratically) whereby 
519 the British would maintain these families in power in return for British 
520 military and protection and, of course, a stop to the raiding of their ships. 
521  
522    The economy in the Gulf, particularly Bahrain, was also based on pearl 
523 diving, mostly done by slaves. The Gulf was then ruled by a British resident. 
524 The small states near the outlet of the Gulf were known as the Trucial States 
525 because of the truces they signed with Britain between 1819 and 1853. Bahrain 
526 signed its treaty in 1892, Kuwait in 1899 (in opposition to the claims of the 
527 Ottoman Empire), and Qatar in 1916. More recently, the Trucial States became 
528 nominally independent as the United Arab Emirates. 
529  
530    In Saudi Arabia, Muhammad Ali, the Albanian serving as the Ottoman governor 
531 of Egypt (later to rebel himself), put down a rebellion by the new Wahhabi 
532 religious sect of Islam in 1817. The Wahhabis are significant because the 
533 Saudi family belongs to this sect.   
534  
535    After World War I, the British had promised independence to the Arabs 
536 (Hussein-McMahon Treaty) in return for their support against the Ottoman 
537 Turks. But they had also signed the Sykes-Picot Treaty with the French, 
538 dividing it up among themselves. That treaty was supposed to secret, but when 
539 the Bolsheviks came to power, they found it in the czar's archives and 
540 published it. Instead, as a token, they gave Jordan and Iraq to two branches 
541 of the Hashemite family which had ruled Mecca.  
542  
543    Meanwhile, the Saudi family was conquering most of the Arabian Peninsula. 
544 They used brutal military force (1902-1935), confiscating even flocks of sheep 
545 and goats which were the livelihood of people in the areas they took over. 
546 They killed many adult men; the Saudis took no male prisoners. 
547  
548    This conquest, which is still fresh in the memories of those who were 
549 conquered, naturally has engendered a lot of hatred for the Saudi family. Ibn 
550 Saud's many marriages into the various tribes was not enough to dispel it. 
551 Further, there is religious dissatisfaction with the Saudis since they are not 
552 the traditional rulers of Mecca. (Particular irony, therefore, in King Fahd's 
553 new self-proclaimed title of Keeper of Mecca and Medina.)   
554  
555 The Role of Oil 
556  
557    Massive oil deposits were discovered in Iran. The British set up a company 
558 to exploit the oil, now known as British Petroleum. In the 1930s, oil was 
559 discovered on the other side of the Gulf, first in Bahrain (1932; production 
560 began in 1934), which had relatively small deposits which are now all pumped 
561 out, and much larger deposits elsewhere. 
562  
563    The British felt they had plenty of oil in Iran and didn't want to develop 
564 other deposits which might increase the supply too high and lower the price. 
565 So US companies managed to gain control over the oil in the Gulf states. Ibn 
566 Saud, for example, had large expenses and little sources of revenue; he sold 
567 his oil rights for a pittance in 1933 to Standard Oil of California (now 
568 Chevron), which later formed Aramco with Exxon, Texaco, and Mobil. Oil 
569 production began in Saudi Arabia in 1938. In 1953 Ibn Saud died. His son Saud 
570 tried to break the agreement with Aramco in favor of Greek shipping magnate 
571 Aristotle Onassis. In 1958 Saud was removed from authority. 
572  
573    After World War II, Iran had a democratic government led by Mohammed 
574 Mossadegh, which wanted to nationalize oil. He was overthrown by a CIA-
575 organized coup, and the Shah was installed in power. In 1958, Iraqis overthrew 
576 the king. Later, the Ba'ath Party came to power; it still rules there. In the 
577 same period (1957-59), there was a revolution in northern Oman. The Saudis 
578 withdrew their support in 1958, and the rebellion was crushed. The Omanis 
579 started a second revolt in 1965 in the southern province of Dhofar. That 
580 revolt was crushed ten years later when the Shah of Iran sent 30,000 troops 
581 into Oman. 
582  
583    Neocolonialism was instituted when the colonial powers came up with the 
584 idea of having the colonies pay their own administrative expenses in response 
585 to the nationalization of oil by Algeria. In the Gulf, this took the form of 
586 the participation agreements where legal ownership over the oil-producing 
587 facilities was gradually turned over to the local governments, who had to pay 
588 production costs instead of the oil companies. Saudi Arabia, for example, was 
589 given 25 percent control in 1972, 30 percent in 1979, and 51 percent in 1983. 
590  
591    This control, however, was financial, not control over production itself. 
592 The price of oil was low (about $3 per barrel), and the oil companies profits 
593 dropped to as low as 9 percent on their invested capital. In 1973, they staged 
594 the phony embargo, and oil company profits rose back to about 15 percent. 
595  
596    In 1961, the new Iraqi regime announced its impending annexation of Kuwait. 
597 The British airlifted troops into Kuwait, and Iraq did not annex the country. 
598 (The borders in that area have an interesting history. Few were interested in 
599 the hinterland, for instance, of Kuwait. The British drew circles around the 
600 cities as borders. In the areas between the circles, nobody claimed ownership. 
601 These areas are now neutral zones. 
602  
603 British Withdrawal 
604  
605    In the 1960s, the British, the dominant military power in the region, went 
606 into an economic slump. At the same time, a strong revolution was underway in 
607 South Yemen. (North Yemen had overthrown the Imam who ruled it in 1962 and 
608 then fought a five-year civil war with Egypt supporting the Republic and Saudi 
609 Arabia supporting the Imam's son. Egypt gave in after the 1967 war, though the 
610 Imam was not reinstated.) In 1971, Britain partially withdrew militarily from 
611 the region, despite the US attempts to get them to stay. In 1969, South Yemen 
612 won its independence, though its economy was crippled because the Suez Canal 
613 had closed during the 1967 war. 
614  
615    At the same time, the United States was engaged in massive intervention in 
616 Vietnam. The Nixon Doctrine of strength, partnership, and negotiations, was 
617 developed to let Asians fight Asians. In the Gulf, it meant that Iranians and 
618 Israelis fight Arabs. 
619  
620    The overthrow of the Shah of Iran came in 1979, the same year there were 
621 two uprisings in widely separated parts of Saudi Arabia: the oil regions and 
622 Mecca. Partnership was a failure, so the United States was forced to fall back 
623 on strength. Since that time, the United States has been desperate to obtain 
624 military bases in the region to protect its economic control over the oil 
625 reserves. The only base the US had was the tiny al-Jufair naval base with two 
626 small and ineffective ships in Bahrain.

627    In 1970, Omani Sultan Said bin Taimur was deposed in favor of his son 
628 Qaboos because an indigenous revolution was gaining ground strongly in the 
629 South. Qaboos turned to the Shah of Iran for help in 1973. That same year 
630 brought the October War. Some of the Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, 
631 declared an embargo which was supposed to stop their oil going to the United 
632 States. Still, more oil came into the United States than before the embargo. 
633 Oil prices, however, and oil profits rose dramatically. 
634  
635    President Jimmy Carter pledged to use US troops to keep the Saudi royal 
636 family in power. There was no threat to them from either Iraq or Iran at the 
637 time (Iran historically claimed Bahrain and did take some Arab islands in the 
638 Gulf under the Shah [greater and lesser Tunb Islands, which belonged to Ras 
639 al-Khaimah], so it was clear that the US government was pledged to protect the 
640 Saudi royal family from overthrow by its own citizens. Carter also pledged to 
641 intervene if U.S. oil companies were threatened with loss of control over oil 
642 production in the Gulf.

675 Bush Has Put Us On The Wrong Side Of Arab History 
676  
677 By John Rossen
678 Insight Features
679  
680    The current jingoist hysteria over Iraq, shamefully echoed by much of the 
681 media and even by knowledgeable and liberal members of Congress who know 
682 better, presents a deadly danger to our country and to world peace. 
683  
684    Look how easy it is now for the Bush administration and its closely linked 
685 oil and military interests!  They are able to manipulate and exploit the anger 
686 of middle class and working class Americans, the millions of people suddenly 
687 forced to pay 20 cents to 45 cents a gallon more for gasoline, big increases 
688 in air fares, and rising costs of all products derived from petroleum. 
689  
690     The danger arises from widespread public ignorance of the history of the 
691 Arab peoples and especially of the legacy of World War I, an ignorance which 
692 makes it easy for jingoes to spread their poison. 
693  
694    With the decline of the Ottoman empire more than a century ago, the 
695 European imperial powers started to take over substantial parts of its domains 
696 in what was then called Arabia. The French ruled Algeria from 1830 until 1962; 
697 the British occupied Egypt in the 1880s.  The Arab peoples suffered greatly 
698 under foreign rule. 
699  
700    When World War I began, the British sent T.E. Lawrence ( the renowned 
701 "Lawrence of Arabia") to Egypt to head their military intelligence section.  
702 Shortly after, as a colonel in the British Army, he helped organize the Arab 
703 revolt against Turkey, an ally of Germany in World War I.  Lawrence's 
704 diplomatic and military genius and his close relationship with and passionate 
705 sympathy for the Arab cause was an importance factor in the defeat of the 
706 Turks and the reconquest of Syria by the Arabs. 
707  
708    In 1919 at the Versailles Conference, Lawrence, hailed by many Arabs as the 
709 "uncrowned King of Arabia," pleaded the cause of Arab nationalism and the 
710 right of self-determination, but to no avail.  In 1921 he became adviser to 
711 the British Colonial Office, but resigned when the British sent in troops to 
712 organize a rebellion against Iraq and installed a sheik as the King of Kuwait. 
713 Thus the "nation" of Kuwait was little more than a creature of British 
714 imperialism. 
715  
716    Little wonder that the first Western powers with troops on Arab soil today 
717 are the United States and England. 
718  
719    The tragic consequences of Bush's threatened military bombing or all-out 
720 invasion of Iraq are so easily perceivable that even conservative political 
721 commentators are warning him of the danger of uniting the Arab world in a 
722 jihad against the U.S. 
723  
724    Iraq would not be another Panama or Grenada.  It could result in a 
725 catastrophe for our country many times worse than Vietnam--not only for our 
726 country, but also for the Arabs, for Israel and its people, and possibly for 
727 the entire world. 
728  
729    Bush and his advisers have hidden from the American people Iraq's 
730 confidential proposals made through diplomatic channels, for a bilateral 
731 conference without preconditions, to search for a just and peaceful resolution 
732 of the conflict.  Bush may believe he is making political hay by beating the 
733 drums of jingoism.  He may even count on making Hussein and Iraq the 
734 scapegoats, as some conservatives have suggested, for the great depression of 
735 1990. 
736  
737    The Middle East crisis is the result of imperial policies that have 
738 exploited and oppressed a great and powerful Arab world for a long time.  The 
739 radical founders of our nation would be spinning in their graves at this 
740 latter-day Tory threat to waste American lives and treasure (at the current 
741 rate of more than $30 million a day!) to restore to power a puppet-dictator 
742 monarch.  
743    As one of the richest men in the world, the King of Kuwait will hardly 
744 suffer in exile.  He has bought up more than a billion dollars worth of U.S. 
745 real estate and has secret bank accounts and hoards of gold around the world.  
746 Even spread out among his 55 wives and many offspring, he and his entire 
747 family are all multimillionaires. 
748  
749      A pillar of the American revolution was the denial of the divine right of 
750 kings and dictatorial tyrants.  The Bush policy is thus a blatant violation of 
751 a cardinal principle of our nation. 
752  
753    The American people must demand that the White House accept the Iraqi offer 
754 to begin negotiations, without preconditions, for a non-military resolution of 
755 this conflict within the Arab world, for recognition of the right of self-
756 determination for Arabs. That message must be sent loud and clear to both the 
757 President and the Congress.

837 Today I have the tower of bable on my mind.  I'm sure most of us are more
838 or less familiar with the story.  It goes more or less like this as I 
839 remember.  
840  
841 Once all the people on earth spoke a single language.  Everyone understood
842 each other.  Then one day a powerfull king decided to build a very tall 
843 tower.  The purpose being to reach heavan, and thus I believe the king felt
844 he would prove himself better then any other mortal man.  Of course, this
845 being an old testament story I believe God got a little ticked at the king,
846 and nocked his tower down, and as punishment he made people speak many [D
847 different languages, so that I would assume they wouldn't be able to so 
848 easily undertake such a massive task.
849  
850 I may have the finer details wrong, but I'm just using the story as a starting
851 point.  Most if not all of the users of this board speak english fluently.
852 I am no exception.  Most of us converse with others on a regular basis.  One
853 would assume that some sort of exchange is taking place, wether it is an
854 exchange of ideas, or meerly small talk.  
855  
856 Words are the tools we use to impart knowledge and understanding upon each 
857 other.  They greatly facilitate our every day survival and well being.  And
858 yet, I'm slowly coming to the realization that no two people actually speak
859 the same language.
860  
861 Few would argue that every single person is a unique individual.  We all have
862 our own personal likes and dislikes.  We all have our own opinions, our own
863 loves and hates.  And we all interact in complex and unique ways.  Or do 
864 we?
865  
866 Have you ever had a debate with another person in which you just couldn't 
867 seem to get your point across?  Did you ever wonder if they felt the same
868 way?  I'm betting they did.  Who was really at fault?  Have you ever argued
869 with somebody for hours, only to realize that they weren't talking about the
870 same thing that you were?
871  
872 How does this happen?  Why does it happen?  Lets assume that both you and
873 your opponent are both native speakers.  How could this misunderstanding 
874 take place?  
875  
876 It seems to me that the only explanation is that with very few exceptions,
877 no two people really speak the same language when you get beyond the "hello
878 how are you" stage of conversation.  Our biasis kick in, and we start filtering
879 things through our world picture.  Bingo, meaning is lost.  Especially when 
880 you realize that the other person is talking to you through their own 
881 world picture.  Quite a bit of information gets lost in the translation.
882  
883 If you want to see this in action, subject somebody to something that is 
884 outside of their world view.  Do their eyes cross?  Do they momentarily 
885 drool?  Don't jump to the conclussion that this only happens to religious
886 zeoloits.  I'm sure you could pull it on almost any liberal minded person
887 as well.
888  
889 Just something thats been running through my mind?  Anybody got any thoughts?

898                  Thoughts To Get You Through Almost Any Crisis
899  
900          1.  Indecision is the key to flexibility.
901          2.  There is always one more son of a bitch than you counted
902              on.
903          3.  If you ever find something you like, buy a lifetime
904              supply, because they will stop making it.
905          4.  All things being equal, fat people use more soap.
906          5.  You can't tell which way the train went by looking at the
907              track.
908          6.  Be kind, everyone you meet is fighting a tough battle.
909          7.  This is as bad as it can get, but don't bet on it.
910          8.  There is absolutely no substitute for a genuine lack of
911              preparation.
912          9.  By the time you make ends meet, they move the ends.
913          10. Happiness is merely the remission of pain.
914          11. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.
915          12. Sometimes too much drink is not enough.
916          13. The facts, although interesting, are irrelevant.
917          14. The world gets a little better every day, and worse in
918              the evening.
919          15. The careful application of pain is also a form of
920              communication.
921          16. Not one shred of evidence exists in favor of the idea
922              that life is serious.
923          17. Someone who thinks logically is a nice contrast to the
924              real world.
925          18. Things are more like they are today than they ever have
926              been before.
927          19. The other line always moves faster until you get in it.
928          20. Anything worth fighting for is worth fighting dirty for.
929          21. Everything should be made as simple as possible but no
930              simpler.
931          22. Friends may come and go but enemies accumulate.
932          23. It's hard to be nostalgic when you can't remember
933              anything.
934          24. I have seen the truth and it makes no sense.
935          25. To live forever, acquire a chronic disease and take care
936              of it.
937          26. Suicide is the most sincere form of self criticism.
938          27. If you think that there is good in everybody, you haven't
939              met everybody.
940          28. If you can smile when things go wrong, you have someone
941              in mind to blame.
942          29. One seventh of your life is spent on Monday.
943          30. The more you run over a dead cat, the flatter it gets.
944          31. Instant gratification takes too long.

960 More and more frequently the edges

963 you, if possible through the skin

974 Instead I have eyes
975 and teeth and other non-green
976 things which rule out osmosis.
977  
978 So be careful, I mean it,
979 I give you a fair warning:
980  
981 This kind of hunger draws
982 everything into its own
983 space; nor can we
984 talk it over, have a calm
