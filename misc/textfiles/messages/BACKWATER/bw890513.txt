 35 Picture, if you will, the following hypothetical succession of newspaper
 36 headlines:
 37  
 38 "Professor claims radical new discovery - Scientific community skeptical"
 39  
 40 "Nation's top experts disagree on 'discovery'"
 41  
 42 "Chief of nation's leading lab can't reproduce experiments"
 43  
 44 "Leading European scientists debunk Prof's. claims"
 45  
 46 "Prof. repeats claim of new discovery - will disclose more details of
 47 experiments"
 48  
 49 "Scientists still not convinced - say discovery is only 'speculation'"
 50  
 51 "Prof. offers to help reproduce experiments"
 52  
 53 These made-up 'headlines' are not talking about the P&F "cold fusion"
 54 experiment, rather they are based on the events following the publication
 55 in the "Philosophical Transactions" for February 19, 1671 of "A Letter of
 56 Mr. Isacc Newton containing his new Theory of Light and Colours".
 57  
 58 I have obviously cast these headlines in the jargon of today's news media;
 59 however, they fit the events of 300 some odd years ago. The 'Chief of nation's
 60 top lab' was none other than Robert Hooke, who was Curator of Experiments for
 61 the Royal Society.
 62  
 63 The experiment that is questioned in the 'headlines' is the now famous
 64 separation of sunlight into the colors of the spectrum by a simple
 65 prism; an experiment that is easily understood by modern school children.
 66  
 67 Not only was Hooke unable to reproduce Newton's simple experiments, he and
 68 other members of the Royal Society, including Sir Robert Moray and Ignance
 69 Gaston Pardies, began to doubt that Newton had even done the experiments!
 70 They claimed, in letters to Newton at Cambridge, that his 'discovery' was
 71 only an hypothesis; a guess.
 72  
 73 The European opposition came from virtuosi as famous as Christiaan Huygens and
 74 as obscure as a monk named Linus, but all agreed: Newton's experiment did not
 75 work and his new theory of colors was just an hypothesis.
 76  
 77 Newton sent numerous letters with further details of the experiment to the
 78 Royal Society and his critics through the Society's secretary, Henry Oldenburg,
 79 The controversy raged for years, and at one point in March of 1673, Newton was 
 80 so fed-up that he even sent Oldenburg a letter of resignation from the Royal
 81 Society.  There were still doubts when Newton came to London in February, 1675 
 82 on other business and attempted to perform the experiment for the Society, but 
 83 was unable to due to bad weather, which only prolonged the debate.
 84 Newton was so disgusted at this point that he put off the publication
 85 of his "Opticks" until 1706.
 86  
 87 This story could go on for several more pages, even in this abbreviated
 88 narrative, but I hope that this gets the point across. The reproduction of 
 89 an experiment that we consider child's play today eluded some of the best 
 90 minds of the seventeenth century for years. I don't know if "cold fusion"
 91 is real or not, but I do know that some of the contradictions of the P&F
 92 experiment have contradicted each other, that others have omitted one or
 93 more critical measurement, and others have had various other problems.  The
 94 book is still open on "cold fusion" and will probably remain open until Pons
 95 and Fleischmann can agree to assist some "name" lab, like Los Alamos to 
 96 reproduce their "experimentum crucis".
 97  
 98 This kind of controversy is not new to science. It existed at the beginings of
 99 modern science in Newton's day, it exist now and probably always will.
100 This current debate over "cold fusion" has a very large component of deja vu.

148 I had the CheaperTaxi driver pull right up in front of the
149 Westin Lenox Hotel. As soon as I saw that the other arrivals
150 were either in chauffeur-driven stretch lemos or having valets
151 park their Euro-spec V12 Jaguars, I knew I had made a faux pas.
152 Bigtime. So as not to appear the rube, I flipped a valet a 20,
153 told the cabbie to keep the meter running and I'd see him in
154 the morning, flipped the doorman a 10 and the bellboy another
155 10, and told them both I'd carry my own bags since they contained
156 the treaties for a ban on nuclear AIDS-pesticides. I sauntered
157 over towards the bar and slipped out a side entrance. I caught the
158 next MARTA train downtown to a Red Roof Inn, where I ought to be
159 cool, even as tired as I was.
160  
161 I asked the desk clerk if she was busy, and in return got an icy
162 stare and a glimpse of a MOTSS Member-4-Life card. I only wanted
163 to check in, not get a date, for crying out loud. When I got to
164 the question on the form that asked for occupation, I put Male
165 Impersonator on a whim. The clerk warmed up immediately, and escorted
166 me personally to a room in the back away from the other guests and
167 asked if I needed company. I told her to wait while I changed, and
168 we'd head out to a bar. As soon as the door was closed, I threw my
169 suitcase out the window. I climbed out, and dropped one story onto
170 my luggage, which burst open, strewing Teddy Ruxpin (TM) Talking Undies
171 everywhere. I grabbed my toothbrush and razor, some mismatched argyle
172 socks, and the SciFi novel I'd started reading on the plane from
173 Philly, and hightailed it out of the alley. A couple of blocks away,
174 I started hitching, and an old geezer in an older, geezier Ford gave
175 me a lift to the Y.
176  
177 The cat at the desk checked me in with no problem, read me the rules,
178 and gave me a room by myself. Of course, I had to share the shower
179 with 7 other guys, 3 gals, and a very hairy foreign national of unknown
180 origin and indeterminate gender. When I refused to join in the soapy
181 gathering, one of them asked me why I had checked into the Young Perverts
182 Orgiastic Society in the first place if I was gonna be hostile. Glancing
183 at my key, I saw my latest mistake, and promised to be right back with
184 my sheep. They brightened up, and I skipped down the hall, sopping wet,
185 to my room. Some wino had made off with everything (including my suit),
186 except my toothbrush and novel, and the Y's towel. I wrapped the towel
187 around my dripping locks, and wandered casually down the fire escape.
188  
189 Slinking from bush to bush, still dripping, clad only in my Y-based turban,
190 mismatched dayglo Argyles, and my last pair of Teddies, which were now
191 shorted out into an endless loop of a gay, loud, "Hi! Wanna be my friend?",
192 which was attracting far too much attention from people I would just as
193 soon avoid right that minute, I finally found an out-of-the-way, darkened
194 pay phone booth. Fortunately, it worked, and accepted 3rd-party charges.
195 Using a purloined IRS phone-billing account, I called my client, and they
196 agreed to move the next day's meeting to the afternoon. Then I called the
197 local cops, told them some nut case was wandering around 5th and Piedmont
198 nekkid, wet, and being too friendly with old ladies. I waited right under
199 the traffic light until the cruiser showed up. They booked me for the night,
200 and I finally had a place to get some rest without fear of terminal
201 embarassment. Twice they brought me cell-mates, but one was a drugged-out
202 Madonna clone, and the other was a Tech student in a drunken stupor, and I
203 knew I wouldn't do anything stupider than them, so I slept just fine at
204 lst.

277 It was about time they got put in their place, nobody put down the wags and
278 got away with it. 
279 	The light on the artificial horizon dimmed, and at that signal he
280 and the rest of the wags charged forward. With a snap of his wrist a knife
281 appeared, and subconciosly he reveled in the thought that he had six proc
282 capability, while just about everybody else was stuck with four. It was
283 going to be one h*ll of a lot of fun.
284 	The first of the trits appeared, they wore scarlet red shirts and
285 pants and their heads were obscured by impenetrable clouds. With screaming 
286 battle crys the two groups came together.
287

374 Again, his views as presented here does not necessarily reflect those of

376      ---------------------------------------------------------------------->> 
377      In a recent series of uploads provided to Freenet by Dale Wedge and Jim 
378 Speiser of Paranet, a December 29, 1987 statement by John Lear was quoted.  
379 Mr. Lear is a reputable and apparently highly qualified airline pilot with 
380 impressive credentials.  Every so often one finds something in UFOlogy which 
381 is simply staggering in its implications but valueless without supporting 
382 evidence and therefore, "hard to swallow." Although he should be admired for 
383 his courage in presenting this information (obtained from various "sources") 
384 without hard objective evidence, Mr. Lear's statement can only be regarded as 
385 interesting reading without evidentiary support.  In short, he sets a nice 
386 table but leaves us waiting for dinner. >> 
387      Were it not for his credentials and ParaNet's assurance of his "numerous 
388 contacts in sensitive positions," the otherwise outlandish claims he makes 
389 could be dismissed as entertaining fiction.  However, Mr. Lear's character and 
390 reputation require that greater consideration be given to his statement.  >> 
391      In summary, Mr. Lear contends that our government has for over 40 years 
392 been concealing from the public a "horrible truth" concerning an "invasion" of 
393 Earth by EBEs (Extraterrestrial Biological Entities). He alleges that the U.S. 
394 government has conducted "business with little gray extraterrestrials for 
395 about 20 years," i.e. we were "sold" by MJ-12 to the aliens in exchange for 
396 technology and to preserve our democracy.  He contends that our government 
397 agreed to ignore human/cattle abductions and mutilations, but that the deeply 
398 sinister purposes of these activities were not completely understood by MJ-12 
399 until about 1984.  >>

401      Without explaining the EBE's reason(s) to do business with the most 
402 powerful nation on Earth when they could covertly continue their activities in 
403 the Third World without concern, or why these advanced and powerful aliens 
404 would even want or require our "agreement" to continue their activities, Mr. 
405 Lear maintains that the purposes of the abductions are: 
406  
407 (1)  The insertion of a 3mm spherical device through the nasal cavity of the 
408 abductee into the brain.  The device is used for the biological monitoring, 
409 tracking, and control of the abductee. 
410  
411 (2)  Implementation of Posthypnotic Suggestion to carry out a specific 
412 activity during a specific time period, the actuation of which will occur 
413 within the next 2 to 5 years. 
414  
415 (3)  Termination of some people so that they could function as living sources 
416 for biological material and substances. (Why not cadavers?) 
417  
418 (4)  Termination of individuals who present a threat to the continuation of 
419 their activity. 
420  
421 (5)  Effect genetic engineering experiments.
422  
423 (6)  Impregnation of human females and early termination of pregnancies to 
424 secure the crossbreed infant. >> 
425  
426      He cites the history of UFOlogy in the 40's and 50's, contending that 
427 several crashed saucers and at least 3 live aliens have been captured and 
428 hidden by the government.  But would such a powerful adversary permit humans 
429 to hold, study and possibly copy crashed saucers or permit us to keep captured 
430 aliens, or would they simply take them back?  >> 
431  
432      The EBEs are said to suffer from an atrophied digestive system which 
433 requires that they sustain themselves by absorbing through the skin a solution 
434 made from certain enzyme/hormonal secretions derived from cattle and humans 
435 and collected by ghoulish cattle and human mutilations.  The various body 
436 parts said to be obtained in this manner are then supposed to be taken for 
437 processing to various hidden laboratories jointly maintained by the aliens and 
438 CIA in the Southwestern U.S.  Although this description of the alien's 
439 atrophied digestive tract agrees with alleged autopsies of dead aliens 
440 (reported by Stringfield, et al).  It is difficult to accept that in at least 
441 2000 years of genetic engineering on cattle and humans, the aliens have not 
442 collected enough material to maintain their own "livestock" and feed 
443 themselves without CIA cooperation. >> 
444  
445      Mr. Lear maintains that a 20 year plan for release of UFO information to 
446 the public (including the history and intentions of the EBE's) to be completed 
447 by 1987-88, was terminated when the "horrible truth" became apparent.  Indeed, 
448 during the first year of the Carter Administration, various media sources, 
449 including Walter Cronkite on the "CBS Evening News" and " U.S. News and World 
450 Report," reported that before the end of that year the administration was to 
451 release UFO information of a "startling" nature.  The information was never 
452 released.  He contends that "Star Wars" is in reality a defensive response to 
453 the EBEs, not Soviet nuclear missiles, but does not explain why the EBEs 
454 permit us to continue with SDI studies that pose a threat to them. >> 
455  
456      Among the many manipulations of human history said to be perpetrated by 
457 the aliens, they maintain that Jesus was their creation and that his 
458 crucifixion has been recorded in an alien holographic videotape.  There are 
459 also said to be other recordings by humans, including an interview of an alien 
460 which is translated by an Air Force Colonel and other tapes said to be held by 
461 UFO investigator William Moore.  It is difficult to understand why such a 
462 superior race, capable of manipulating human civilization for a minimum of 
463 2000 years, would wait to subjugate the planet for that same period.  At the 
464 time of Christ, our most advanced missile system was the "slingshot." We are 
465 now capable of nuclear "suicide." Insane as that would be, their food supply 
466 would go up with us. >> 
467  
468      Further evidence should be interesting and will be anxiously awaited. >>

488 COLMAN McCARTHY: Sending a Real Message to Exxon 
489 WASHINGTON POST: STYLE, 05/14/89 Copyright (c) 1989 The Washington Post Co.
490 By COLMAN McCARTHY
491  
492     It was lively theater but not much more when a member of Congress stood in 
493 the well of the House the other day and scissored in half his Exxon credit 
494 card. It was heady populism but not much more when some talk-radio babblers 
495 called for a boycott of Exxon. 
496     Aside from a few satisfying moments of stick-it-to-the-bums glee, these 
497 attacks on Exxon the oil spiller do little to protect the world from the next 
498 blackening, in Alaska or wherever. What does a boycott accomplish? Don't fill 
499 up at the Exxon gas station but drive down the street to Amoco? That's the 
500 company guilty of Europe's worst oil spill, when its Amoco Cadiz came apart 
501 off the coast of Brittany in 1978. Or perhaps instead of Exxon, boycotters 
502 should buy from Union? It was 20 years ago this spring that one of Union's 
503 offshore oil rigs broke and blackened the beaches of Santa Barbara, Calif. 
504     I went to Santa Barbara in May 1969 to write about the spill. Boycott 
505 fervor was in the air then, too, if not the water. Union was scorned by the 
506 citizens' group GOO (Get Oil Out). 
507     Big oil didn't get out not out of the Santa Barbara Channel, nor Prince 
508 William Sound, nor Antarctica's Palmer Peninsula, where 250,000 gallons of oil 
509 were spilled last January. 
510     To be meaningful, a boycott of all oil companies is needed. The 
511 congressman-showman who snipped his Exxon credit card would have been credible 
512 had he announced, say, that he was cutting in half his personal consumption of 
513 oil or was taking public transportation or commuting by bicycle to work or 
514 insulating his home, or was pushing for heat-tight buildings back in his home 
515 district where he rents office space. 
516     Energy conservation and energy efficiency is the only boycott that oil 
517 companies respect, because it's the only one that can last beyond the latest 
518 postspill furor. If a nation's habits of consumption are radically changed, 
519 the oil industry's habits of production are forced to change also. 
520     Greenpeace magazine reports this month that "the United States loses more 
521 energy each year through poorly engineered windows than is provided by all the 
522 oil flowing through the Alaska pipeline. From this perspective, leaving it in 
523 the ground is far cheaper and less destructive than pumping it, burning it and 
524 spilling it across oceans from Cape Horn to the Bering Sea." 
525     Environmental groups have deep wells of information to prove that America 
526 can save more oil than it can produce or import. Changing cars from gas 
527 guzzlers to gas sippers has been demonstrated. In 1973 automobile efficiency 
528 was an inefficient 14 miles per gallon. Two years later federal standards were 
529 passed, and the efficiency doubled to 28 mpg by 1987. The technology is 
530 available to increase it to 45 mpg by 1995, which would eventually more than 
531 eliminate the need to import any oil at all. 
532     Nothing has been said by George Bush since the Alaska spill about rallying 
533 the country to conservation or efficiency. The former Texas oil man doesn't 
534 think that way. The Village Voice reports that while he was vice president, 
535 Bush's Task Force on Regulatory Relief tried to repeal the 1975 fuel 
536 efficiency standards. Congress refused but did, as a compromise, weaken them. 
537     Instead of promoting conservation and efficiency, Bush remains the old 
538 Texas wildcatter who never sees an oil field he doesn't want to drill. His 
539 Interior Department is advancing proposals for exploiting coastal oil off 
540 Washington, Oregon and Florida, as well as in the Arctic National Wildlife 
541 Refuge. Of seven industrial nations, the United States ranks last in the 
542 percentage of income devoted to energy conservation research. 
543     If oil were an illegal drug, the United States would be the world's 
544 sorriest addict. It has 5 percent of the Earth's population but consumes 25 
545 percent of its energy. The high from this addiction is so pleasurable that 
546 only a few politicians dare advance the conservation ethic. A member of 
547 Congress who called on Americans, say, to bicycle to work would be as 
548 ridiculed as Jimmy Carter was when he asked citizens to lower their 
549 thermostats. 
550     Whether freebasing on crack or oil, addicts lose touch with reality. Now 
551 the Exxon addicts are announcing that they are changing dealers, as if 
552 becoming an Amoco addict is the answer. It's not. A boycott high, apparently, 
553 has some of the same thrill as an oil high. And the same downer after.       
554

584 HAPPY BIRTHDAY BWMS!  (And someone else, incidentally.... :-])
585 Today marks the second anniversary of BWMS II, brought on line at midnight
586 the morning of the 17th of May, 1987.  Take a look at the "AU" command.
587 Yep.  Right there in vivid black and green (or whatever your terminal is).
588 AND NOW, A BIT OF TRIVIA: The first person to log on to BWMS II was
589 Jeff Green, also known as the Doctor (one of many on BWMS).  Some
590 bizarre mage character named Milchar was the last on BWMS I.
591 AND WHAT IS BWMS?  The hardware?  Read the "AUTHOR" command.  HOW ABOUT
592 THE ORIGINAL ONE?  A modified DiskWriter, circa 1975 technology methinks.
593 8K rom, 1K ram, 630 disk sectors a disk, 1 for the system and 629 for
594 text.
595 So, now that BWMS II has survived its second year (despite the fact I
596 had a hand in writing the software!), shall we have a party?  Where? When?
597 Inquiring minds.....nahh, forget that cliche'.  Anyone have any ideas?
598 (chanting HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU in background,
599 do this out loud in your own home for better effect.  Thank you.)
600 Now, I wonder where my "Bake B-Day Cake" 3x5 card is?

619 HELMSMAN CAN'T EXPLAIN SPILL:-5/17/89
620     Gregory Cousins, third mate of the Exxon Valdez, said he couldn't pinpoint 
621 how the tanker ran aground March 24, spilling 11 million gallons of oil off 
622 the Alaska coast. Cousins, at the helm when the accident occurred, appeared 
623 before a National Transportation Safety Board panel in Anchorage.
624     The Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup in Valdez, Alaska, has brought a short-
625 term economic boom to the port city. Some have made small fortunes. But there 
626 is little pleasure in the added commerce, local officials say as the National 
627 Transportation Safety Board conducts hearings in Anchorage this week into the 
628 accident.
629     Valdez, Alaska, has roughly doubled its 3,000 population since the Exxon 
630 tanker spill March 24. Local businesses are shorthanded because employees have 
631 left, lured to the cleanup by $16.69-an-hour wages. There are no hotel rooms 
632 and houses are renting for $12,000 a month.
633     More than 40 lawsuits have been filed against Exxon Corp. over the Alaska 
634 oil spill disaster, and dozens more are pending, according to company 
635 spokesman Leo McLean. Experts say the litigation will break new ground by 
636 applying an array of statutes -from ancient doctrines of admiralty law to the 
637 latest environmental legislation.
638                                                                         
639 HONESTY MISSING, SURVEY SAYS:-5/17/89
640     A survey of 1,000 adults finds that 75 percent of the people in the United 
641 States think honesty and ethical behavior have declined in the past few 
642 decades, reports Parents magazine. Eighty percent say they think the nation's 
643 ethics are lower than they should be. And 92 percent favor the teaching of 
644 honesty in schools.
645                                                                               
646 BUSH NON-COMMITTAL ON COOKIES-5/17/89
647     Most politicians stay neutral on major issues, but President Bush is taking
648 the non-committal stance to a new extreme. 
649     That's because he won't help California grade school kids decide on which 
650 should be the "national cookie" --Oreos or chocolate chips. 
651     Fifth-grade teacher Rosemary Hartner says her 21 students sent Bush letters
652 regarding the controversial cookie conflict. Most were pro-chip. 
653     But Hartner felt Bush should make the final decision.
654     However, his response left the kids in limbo.
655     Written on White House stationery and signed by Bush, it reads: 
656     "How thoughtful of you to send me your essays on the national cookie. It's 
657 always a joy to see young citizens using their talents in a creative way. You 
658 can be proud of your work." 
659     Hartner says her students enjoyed getting the letter, but were upset that 
660 Bush didn't help them solve the issue. 
661     Hartner says she explained to the kids that Bush is a politician and that 
662 seemed to satisfy them.
663                              After all, what can you expect from a politician?
664 Especially the one that will veto the minimum wage law passed by Congress, over
665 a difference that amounts to about two gallons of milk a month in take home pay
666 to the lowest wage earners in this country.  A kinder, gentler, nation, indeed!
667

793     Annual petroleum imports are forecast to exceed do}estyc crude oil 
794 production for the first time since 1977, according to the Independent 
795 Petroleum Association of America. This is supported by the forecast that U.S.

802 man-made pollutants. University of Toronto researchers say "a nearly globally" 
803 sea level rise during this century might be attributed to "climatic warming."

805 EXXON - RESPONSE `OUTSTANDING':-5/19/89
806     Exxon Shipping President Frank Iarossi Thursday defended his company's 
807 response to the Exxon Valdez spill as "outstanding" - saying the only failure 
808 was the ship's inabiliti0to recover the oil. Iarossi was questioned before a 
809 National Transportation Safety Board panel in Anchorage, Alaska. He also 
810 defended Exxon's drug and alcohol policy, saying it had resulted in 34 firings 
811 in five years.
812     Joseph Hazelwood, fired captain of the Exxon Valdez, was a respected 
813 seaman plagued by alcoholism and lack of initiative, according to confidential 
814 performance reviews released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The 
815 agency is investigatyng the spill. Hazelwood received hospital treatment for 
816 alcoholism in 1985.
817     A lawyer defending Exxon in Alaska oil spill suits has been arrested on 
818 charges of drunken driving in Alaska. News of the arrest came as Exxon 
819 executives were defending the company at a shareholders meeting in New Jersey. 
820 Douglas Serdahely, 42, was arrested Wednesday. Meanwhile, Exxon said Thursday 
821 that it would begin randomly testing employees for drug and alcohol use.
822 EXXON MEETING - MIHUD RUSULTS:-5/19/89
823     When Exxon Corp's turbulent annual meeting Thursday in New Jersey was 
824 over, nobody could agree on how it fared in the wave of monumental criticism 
825 over the Alaska oil spill. Shareholders seemed mollified. Environmentalists 
826 say they were insulted.
827     Exxon tightly controlled its annual meeting Thursday in Parsippany, N.J., 
828 despite the throng of oil-spill protesters. It was ripe for hysterics, but 
829 never got out of hand. Every person who wanted to speak was given two minutes. 
830 Ed Rothschild, a representative of five environmental groups, asked for Exxon 
831 Chairman Lawrence Rawl's resignation. Rawl refused.
832     At Thursday's shareholders meeting on the oil-spill response Exxon 
833 Chairman Lawrence Rawl said: The company has spent $115 million on cleanup and 
834 believes it can finish by mid-September; the firm will do random drug and 
835 alcohol tests on several thousand employees, including executives; and a panel 
836 will review0management performance. Most shareholders expressed satisfaction.
837     Environmentalists were not impressed Thursday with the steps Exxon Corp. 
838 told shareholders it had taken to respond to the Alaska oil spill. Jay Hair, 
839 president of the National Wildlife Federation, said company Chairman Lawrence 
840 Rawl "came off as arrogant." Exxon managers are failing at salvaging their 
841 image, said John Merriam, chairman of the Conference on Issues and Media.
842     Despite the public attention over the oil spill raised at its annual 
843 meeting Thursday, Exxon is probably not in any immediate financial danger 
844 because of the spill, financial experts say. Exxon's net income for the first 
845 three months 1989 was $1.3 billion, or 99 cents a share, down 7 percent, 
846 mostly because of rising crude prices. Its stock was up 3/8 Thursday to 43 1/4.

849 REINCARNATION/UFO ABDUCTION INSURANCE-5/19/89
(50     Want to get paid 10 million bucks for being abducted by an outerspace 
851 alien? 
852     Or 20 million smackers for being reincarnated? 
853     That's the amount Florida accountant Mike St. Lawrence claims he will pay 
854 if folks purchase his "future life insurance" and/or "UFO abduction 
855 insurance." 
856     Here's how the reincarnation insurance works: Pay a one-time fee of $9.95 
857 and collect 10 million when you prove in your next life that you bought the 
858 policy in this lyfe. 
859     You get 20 million if you return as a lower life form like a plant or 
860 animal. 
861     As for the UFO abduction insurance, 10 million dollars is yours if you've 
862 been kidnapped and obtain a authorized signature from an extraterrestrial. 
863     St. Lawrence says he's sold about 10,000 policies so far. 
864     Even actress/New Age Priestess Shirley MacLaine owns one. 
865     And there's one being sent to Prince Charles and Princess Di.--M.D.

898  
899      Today is the day that Roger reaches his Majority. The
900 fact that he feels he is not ready does not matter. Measuring from 
901 conception he is 124 year old. No fond farwells, only a quick freez and
902 trip outsystem to some far off colony world. 
903      "Oh I wanta be a farmer, a farmeb0I wyll be." he sings to himself. 
904 The training he has recieved has all been academic, as there is very 
905 little free space for growing food on the Earth itself, and even if
906 there were the air outside would not allow it. So he will arrive, be 
907 thawed and start working. "I'll even be off these suppresents" He 
908 thinks, but it is a neutral thought. 
909      A bell rings, and knowing that this is the signal he stands, grabs
910 his bag and walks from the room. The walls are a happy loking blue, 
911 and he is happy to. The lights flicker, and momentarily the walls turn
912 red. He feels a surge of hate, but it passes as the lights return to
913 normal. (In a room far away many people in white smocks node to each 
914 other, the experament has been a success.) 
915      As he reaches the final gate there is again a flickering, this time 
916 the walls turn green. He feels somthing... Back to the happy blue,
917 and calmness returns. Through the gates he goes, up the walk and into
918 the waiting room. There he waits, standing stiffly in place against one
919 of the wall. The walls flash brown, and suddenly he is raked with pain.
920 He falls to the floor, and grasping his head begins to moan softly. 
921 But his eyes are now closed and the pain has gone away. His eyes
922 open and he stands, returning to the wall. Time passes. It grows dark
923 and he sleeps... It is a cold sleep.
924      His parents, long dead knew him only as accidetal fetus #987436.
