41 L'homme:  Tis I.   A plot more foul than my own has laid waste to many a Border on what is now the 
42   "reserve disk".  On my return to re-read the entry I had left for the rest, and to visualize the
43   thinkings of the others that share these sectors, I had noticed that the four lines with which I
44   had entrusted with my (mine now) name had been stealthily removed.  To quote that most famous 
45   penguin among us, I say: "Ooooooooooooooo!!!"
46   I have met many a person in my short existance. Some of them are known to one heralded as 
47   "Blackbeard" and they are known as "The Defenders of the Faith". It seems thatboth NET and the

53 DID YOU EVER WONDER JUST HOW IGNORANT RENT-A-COPS CAN BE? I found out, purely
54 by accident of course. Yes, yes.    You see, after having passed by what I 
55 thought was the NEW NET HQ (big letters that ought to catch someones eye) on
56 Saturday, I went to a more centrally located eatery by the name of "Arctic
57 Circle" on Broadway and Yamhill.  After having attempted to swallow what they
58 called a milkshake, I was feeling a little chilly and decided to remove my
59 jacket from my big black bag of almost infinite holding. I decided that I may
60 as well put my jacket on now since I was going to be leaving, and it was
61 getting to be a little chilly outside in the dark (about 6:00 p.m.)
62 Since I had been trying to crack into this neat-o nifty group of people called
63 NET spy agents, I had decided that if I would succeed, I would need some of the
64 junk- er, gadgets that looked spy stuff...  Cap Gun? check. Flashlight? check.
65 Lotsa notebooks to write down vital spy info-trash? check. All there...
66 Well, as I was taking my jacket out of my bag, I noticed that there was a
67 rent-a-cop about twenty feet away from me participating in worthless chatter
68 with a couple of regulars (they looked like they might be regulars). You know
69 what a rent-a-cop looks like don't you? They have a Handi-talkie on one side,
70 and a radio police scanner on the other just to make sure they won't fall over
71 sideways from all this superior technology hanging on their pants. On the back
72 side of the leather belt he had his trusty PR-24 (aka new billy club w/ handle)
73 and some kind of first aid junk that probably only looks nice but doesn't do 
74 a thing for an injured person.  Anyway, as I take my jacket out of my bag, my
75 Cap Gun falls to the floor. I should probably mention that this particular Cap
76 Gun is all black with flat black finish- it looks real.  The rent-a-cop, only
77 being about half as dense as I thought, takes a half-hearted look in my 
78 direction to see what the noise is.  I casually scoot the cap gun between both
79 my feet and pick it up and put it away trying to make it look like nothing
80 really important happened. The rent-a-cop, still leaning against the counter
81 points his free hand in my direction and asks, in not too subtle a manner, 
82 "Is that a real gun?"    #That's it you fool! tell everybody within earshot
83 that there could be a critical situation here. Fool!# "It's a toy gun. Do 
84 you want to see it?" is my casual response, accompanied with a smile as I 
85 finish putting my jacket on.  "That's alright," he says. "If it were real,
86 you wouldn't have offered." was his response. #Quick response from a person
87 with a brain the size of a pea,# I thought.  #What better way would there have
88 been for me to have hidden the fact that I might have had a REAL gun than to
89 offer him the cahnce to see it? The total Fool!#  I picked up my bag and slung
90 it onto my shoulder and began to walk out of the dive. As I passed the "pork
91 for hire" on the way out, I very casually said "OH?" and kept right on walking.

122          buy a pea-shooter, it's less expensive than a cap gun. i like your
123              rent-a-porky story.
124                                       pea-brained too.

126 abacab - So what's he supposed to do? Whip his trusty two way out, point
127 it at you and yell "Make my day!" ? I think you're giving him less credit
128 then he is due. At least he took intrest in what happened instead of
129 hiding and thinking "God, I hope he doesn't shoot me." as most people 
130 would. I give him credit for at least attempting to find out if you had
131 a valid reason for having a gun (which he probably already knew was a
132 toy anyway).

135 Hi All,  Have you ever wondered how one of those amp meters works?  You know,
136 those thing that messure current in a wire.  Well, I've done some research,
137 and I found this answer and a few other interesting facts.  So, this is how
138 an amp meter works...  (big important sounding music and fanfare.)
139 	To start out, we have to define electricy.  As we all know, electricty
140 consists of lot of little penquin particals (Opusions) rolling something in
141 a wire.  What are they rolling?  I believe they are rolling little Edgar
142 Allen Poe books.  This would explain many mysteries about electricy.
143 For instance, when you read Poe, doesn't your scalp tingle, and your hair 
144 start to stand on end?  Same thing with and amp meter, except instead of lots
145 of hairs and one book, it has one hair (the needle) and lots of books.  I stand
146 on end too.  
147 	This also explains why wires are covered.  Poe is a lot more effective in
148 the dark, and so is electricy.  That's why they put plastic around all the 
149 wires.  Also, ever noticed how much better a flashlight works when it's in
150 the dark.
151 	So much for electricty.  Next week, on to quantum mechanics!
152 (More big important sounding music)

156      My name's Joe Friday.  My beat is downtowm portland.  Just yesterday
157 a little thing happened that might interest you.
158      It was in a small fast-food restaurant, the same one that is located just
159 dowm the street from where the girl got raped last week.  The attacker wore a 
160 black jacket, a ski mask, and first approached the victim with a toy gun.
161      As I was talking to a couple of off-duty employees, asking if they had 
162 seen anything unusual on that night last week, I saw a man at one of the tables
163 pull a black jacket out of a large bag.
164      I had seen the girl when she went to the station house.  I have a few
165 friends left, not all have been forced into retireme.  She looked like she
166 would be alright.  She was the type that wasn't going to let it tear her up
167 forever, but I think it was the shear violence of what had happened that got
168 to her.  I don't think any man will ever be able to really understand how a 
169 woman feels after a thing like that happens.
170      The only thing she had been able to tell about her attacker, other than
171 a physical description, was that he had spoken with a very thick English 
172 axcent.
173      I watched the man with the black jacket.
174      A toy gun fell out.
175   
176      I didn't want to alarm anyone else, the two employees were still standing
177 next to me, one even saw the toy hit the floor.  By the look on her face it 
178 seemed like she thought it might be real.  It would take her a second, the
179 sound of plastic when it hits the floor is alot different than metal.
180      Putting on my best dumb-cop voice, I asked "Is that a real gun?"
181      I relaxed when the answer came back in a clear, crisp tone." No, it's
182 a toy, you want to see it?"
183      No axcent.
184      There were other things I had to do than examine someone's toy gun.  I
185 had some more people to talk to.

190     "Ever looked up through the twisting branches of a tree? It contorts the
191 neck a wee bit, but otheerwise it is perfectly nice to do."  Said the Odd One.
192     "I am not ancient yet, I can still look to the skies."  With some effort,
193 the Sage looked up into the trees, "Albeit it is less than perfectly easy for
194 me to do so."  Clearing his throat to cover the groans, Sage looked back down.
195 It was a nearly pitifull sight to see the shamed Sage looking to the ground and
196 waiting for his friend to look down to the ground also.
197 
198     In an effort to lighten the mood this little jaunt was assuming, the Sage
199 produced a white dove and threw it forth into the air. Where it eventually came
200 to soar with such grace that the Sage easily looked to the sky.  Forgetting for
201 all intents and purposes, his former inability to do so.
202 
203     The bird dipped and swayed, and the eyes that followed it's airplay soon
204 came to find respect and deep admiration for the lines of the dove's wings and
205 neck, even the ever forward head of the bird fomented great emotion within
206 them.  The bird eventually soared to stop on the Sage's outstretched arm.
207 
208     "Quite a show."  Said the Odd One, impressed with measure.
209     "Quite a friend,"  Said Sage, renewed with feeling.  A nice feeling since
210 the everpresent feeling of oncoming death only of only a few moments ago.
211     "How long have you had her?"  Asked the Odd One, filling with esteem for 
212 this wonderous friend walking slowly aside him.
213     "I am not sure how long she has been with me, I only know I do not own her.
214 She gently retains my company and that is all that I may ask of her. Anything
215 else would be presuming quite much, for she does have her own life after all."
216     "I ought to've known this, forgive me, sweet bird, for presuming so."  Said
217 the Odd One to the bird with a voice not mocking but with a tinge of experiment
218 inside it.
219 
220     After the bird has finished cooing softly, the Sage started to speak as if
221 he might be translating for her,  "She apologizes for me, she says that her
222 company is not nearly as selective, or as fickle as I make it sound sometimes."
223     "Tell her for me please,"  Said the Odd One, now mockingly, "that she ought
224 ot apologize for a friend when the friend might hear. It is less than totally
225 complimentary."  The Odd One finished dallying in something he consdiered quite
226 a game.  Speaking to birds, really!  Everyone knows they have not the brains
227 for it!  Everyone knows.
228 
229     The bird softly cooed for only a little while this time, and then she did
230 the oddest thing.  She looked directly into the Odd One's gaze with the most
231 comprehending expression that the Odd One had seen in most people for a long
232 time.  The Odd One started looking about, explaining the stare as the random
233 actions of an animal to himself.  Not daring to mention it aloud, the bird
234 might hear him.

241 Hey, Joe! Dragnet type person! Take notice as to my description as well as
242 your own and you will see that they don't match. You said "Black jacket from
243 a large bag" when it was a "jacket from a large black bag."  The jacket was
244 not Black, It was Green and Orange... Doesn't that mean anything to you?
245 Besides, if I were to actually have committed such an act as you accuse me of,
246 I seriously wouldn't have told anyone here. Too many people know where I live,
247 and I wouldn't be able to wake up alive if I had.     Nice try, Friday...

254   markesson opened the passenger door... and went around to the drivers seat
255 and opened it... markesson stooped to enter... then the long limousine left the
256 curb... and merged with all the traffic of the wide european streets...
257 
258   the street lamps caused weird reflections on the clouded windows of the black
259 limousine... tilean turned on the telivision in the back of the seat... and
260 turned to his companion... and said something about always feeling foreign...
261 if he didn't know the news of the area... he said this in a englich accent of
262 the danish... it sounded nifty... castrated but nifty...
263 
264   "what is you profession... aside from rescuing damsels in distress that is.."
265 asked the lady companion... who seemed delighted with the appearence of this
266 perfect stranger...
267   "i usually own a ship salvaging operation... i usually work in london..."
268   "what are you doing... unusually... that brings you here..."
269   "auditing... the local salvages have been coming up short..."
270   "salvages coming up short... how does one salvage shortly..."
271   "one doesn't find everything on the ship that was there before the sinking...
272 and might not have been washed away..." assuming a mocking tone he further said
273 "in the briny depths..."
274 
275   tilean smiled... his companion started to shiver in jest... and they laughed
276 for a little while... then tilean said something else... "and there is some
277 talk of the military... nothing i am sure... they probably got upity when we
278 lost that ship for them..."
279 
280   "oh... the military... how interesting... how do you lose a ship anyway..."
281   "you have a fire... lose all the copies of all the charts... and an old tramp
282 steamer lost in the nineteen thirties is lost... they were using it for troop
283 stuff in world War two..."
284 
285   "impressive... so why did the military ask you here..." asked the companion
286 of tilean...
287   "we transferred all the staff of the burned office... we found recently that
288 it was arson... and one of the staff is suspected..."
289 
290   "my... all this intrigue must be shaking me more than i thought... thank you
291 for dispatching that lug... i ought to return to my hotel soon though..." and
292 the companion nodded as if to verify... herself...
293 
294   "i understand" charmed tilean "and we will arrive there shortly... until then
295 if you woukld be so good as to give me your name... that i may see you again...
296 as i so wish to do..."
297 
298 ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
299 
300   markesson groaned silently... tilean was laying things on a little thick...
301 everything a little thick... that story he told... convincing cover... too bad
302 no one was ever going to believe it... especially not that little kgb s... no
303 markesson realized it was not appropriate to call names... even though that
304 little slut had killed fourteen of his operatives this year... such was even
305 the slight duties of administrations...
306 
307   markesson wanted to pull over into an alley and pump her full of hot lead...
308 but she was necessary to cool of the kgb as to tilean and his presense here...
309 they would believe here was here with something to do with that old tug the
310 brits had lost in the "war to end all wars..."
311 
312 ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
313 
314   the companion stepped out of the limousine... as it pulled away... someone
315 called her miss kreukin... and she entered the lobby of her hotel... noticed
316 the clue on one of the telephones... her spies among the employees earned their
317 months pay... someone was waiting for her in her apartment...
318 
319   miss kreukin off the elevator and trodded lightly on the soft carpets... she
320 tried the knob on her door... it was open... she retreived her gon from her leg
321 holster... weilding the hefty automatic... she entered the room and reached
322 over to the wall in search of the light switch... she found it... and threw the
323 lights on... ready for whatever was going to happen...
324 
325   nothing happened... she retreived her hand from at the light switch... it
326 felt odd... she looked at the tips of her fingers... smeared in redness...!

371 Subj: UNDERGROUND Trainee Course, part IV
372 Gentlemen, a Target suitable for Stage IV training has presented himself.
373 I trust that none of you will have any problems with this one, he seems to
374 be a below-average challenge.  Your Stage I - III training should be more than
375 adequate for the task.  Remember: 50 points for intelligent insult, 30 points
376 for clever insulting phrase, and 1 point for name-calling.

379      I pause momentarily in my conversation with the Innkeeper, my ears
380 pricking up at what might have been an imagined sound.  Did I hear what I
381 thought I heard?  The pause lengthens, becomes a silence, and when the Inn-
382 keeper begins to ask why I've stopped, I quiet him with a quick gesture.
383 A friend has come by, but says little to draw attention her way.  How can
384 I let her know she is welcome here, how can I draw her from the shadows?
385 "She goes where she finds the need...", my words echo hollowly through my
386 head, and then I stand and move behind the counter.
387 
     It is much too late, or perhaps too early, but I must still take the
388 time to make my feelings known.  Opening the ice-box, I pull from within a
389 bottle that rapidly condenses moisture upon its sides in delicious coolness.
390 I open the bottle, pour a small amount of the thick, pearl colored liquid
391 into a bowl, and turn back to the room.

392      "Milk?"  I inquire, hoping to draw the feline from the shadows.

402     "Are you an expert on the habits of Dragons?  I desperately need an expert
403 on their comings and goings.  The big ones I mean, not the dwarfy ones, and I
404 most certainly do not need the smurfy ones either. No. I need an expert on the
405 comings and goings of non smurphy big old dragons. That is what I need, are you
406 it?"  The Former sat back, as if he had just said something.  Which he did, but
407 only by strict interpretation of the rules.  Otherwise, well, it was ugly.
408 
409     "What?!?"  Came the highly enlightened voice from across the commons.
410     "Anyone know the slightest thingy about dragons?"  Reposed the Former from
411 atop his table.  No one else really bothered him about it now.  It was his
412 table, yes indeedy his table.
413     "None of you know anything about dragons? Fooey! Fooey I say, I need an
414 expert of dragons before the little girl comes back. And she will be back soon,
415 so please do hurry."  The Former seemed as if he were whispering to everyone in
416 the rather largish commons.  An excellant thing to do, whisper to ninety people
417 or so in a single sentence.
418 
419     "Quickly now, I would be oh so pleased if someone would help me to find out
420 a miserable little fact this girl has chosen to ask me.  What does a dragon
421 dream about after the dragon has eaten a speaking thing?  I am at a loss to say
422 what, and although I might make an effective liar, she knows it, I can tell."
423 
424     A few conversations had again started, and so the Former thought himself
425 sure to be found out as not being utterly perfect, when he thought he might
426 just have heard a slight murmuring somewhere in the background.  As if someone
427 about to speak-

471 The air was chill, and the night in full swing as the frail-looking, white
472 cloaked wizard approached the warm and secure looking little building.
473      As he drew nearer, the small amount of light present revealed the
474 unobtrusive, and actually rather plain label; "BackWater Inn", printed on the
475 door.
476      He paused on the front porch.
477 His thought-sight told him that the inhabitants of this place were benevolent.
478      In a whisper so subtle that he went unnoticed, the pale figure slipped
479 inside the door and into a darkened booth out of the way of the main stream
480 of attention. He sat back and serveyed the laughing, friendly group that 
481 obviously made up what could be called "The Regulars".
482      His eyes, both external and internal, exposed this gathering as being
483 one of intelligence, creativity, and individuality, the likes of which he had
484 not seen previously. As he scanned the individual parts of the group, one
485 face stood out in more ways than  one: The obvious in that he was standing
486 on a table, and addressing the Inn,
487 and the sublime in that his features, in both mind and body, were vaugely
488 and distantly familiar, as if he and the Wizard had met before, in another
489 reality... He was asking about Dragons; Something the wizard was well educated
490 as to...
491 //././././././././././././././.The Necromancer././././././././././././././././.
492 
493 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (then again...)
494      Lest we not forget that The INN is a common and popular place, it is 
495 filled with those known as regular customers and many others. These others
496 may enter singly or in small groups, but usually alone. These others enter
497 into The INN only to sit and listen, they rarely speak and when some do, they
498 are ruthlessly cut-down by others that are not regular customers... er, I mean
499 'patrons'.          These others have been given a name that is readily used
500 by most, but which I will now no longer use. This name is 'lurker', and it 
501 implies that these others do not present their voices or leave any notices 
502 on the always crowded and always cleared cork-board. I will refer to them 
503 as 'visitors'.  The INN will be filled with regular 'patrons' and 'visitors'.
504 Yes, that has a better sound to it.
505 
506      Some names are held with reverance among us, and their returns are often
507 long awaited. I am sorry, but some of these names mean little to me for I
508 am not witness to what has brought about such fame and praise. I only
509 will know of these as 'visitors' due to their great infrequency.  [(?)]
510      The time has come that my mug of the great brown ale is empty on this,
511 one of many visits. I look at it with great sorrow, for I do not extend my
512 stay for much longer than I am of any 'finanial gain' or relevance to the
513 other guests or our honorable INNKeeper. I take a slow pace to the far door.
514      Does anything bar my way with another question or observation?...

519     "Where are we? Or do you even know? At this point, it would be wise to tell
520 me, don't you think?"  Said the Odd One to his walking friend of across the
521 path.  A curious twisting path, made of trodden soil and more than one or two
522 shortcuts.  It is a curious path indeed.
523 
524     "We are some distance from my manse yet. In time, we will arrive no matter
525 how long it takes us. We will get there, and if not soon then in years!"  Said
526 the Sage, in mock triumphant tones.  And continued, "And yes, someday we may
527 even strike up a church."  The Sage supressed a gigle by biting his tongue.  A
528 bit too hard, but no gigle spoiled the mood.  Tongue in cheek.
529 
530     "So you are telling me that you have no idea where we are, and we will die
531 out in this infernal forest, or we will find your manse. If it truly exists
532 that is, and to be completely honest I am starting to disbelieve you when you
533 even say that!"  The Odd One seemed quite aroused at this walk all of a sudden.
534 
535     "Alright then, if we really must end our jaunt on this truly marvelous day,
536 then so be it."  With this the Sage parted some branches, avoided a scrape or
537 two and came out all in all in good health.  So he let the branch go, which did
538 not acheive the same results on the Odd Companion.  Who had just received a
539 mouthfull of leaves, tasted good actually.  Not as much as when forced though.
540 
541     "And here we are, this is home for me, and now you."  Said the Sage as he
542 held his arms in an arc as if to show the magnificense of his home.  There was
543 not jest in his voice now, nay there was no jest deserved.
544     The manse was long, and comprised of smaller arcs which became their own
545 houses and buildings.  They all interlinked in their position though, so that a
546 bird say, might see it as a large rose.  White with the marble used in almost
547 all the buildings, save a few which were other colors for no real reason to
548 speak of.
549 
550     "Majestic, isn't it?"  Said the Sage in a voice which held absolutely no
551 modesty in it.  Not a single doubt in his voice, this was magnificent and it
552 was his residence.  Proud of it, he ought to be.
553     The Sage stepped across the lawns to the first house which presented itself
554 to the pair.  Bounding up the stairways, Sage explained that this was the Earth
555 Natural Science wing, and that he wanted to show him some things about turtles.
556 
557     "You have a science wing in your home? Sorry, homes. And you actually use
558 it or is it just for show?"
559     "Sometimes I am really not that sure of it, but I think I actually use it."
560     "Is this the only one?"
561     "Good heavens no! I have availed myself of large libraries, and each wing
562 has it's very own library of tomes compiled by me or others."
563     "A fine acheivement, but do you sleep on a cot in order to make for more
564 room?"  Asked the Odd One.
565     "I sleep in my room, in another wing which has eluded naming for quite some
566 time. Anyway, is it any less than I have described to you on more than a few
567 occaisions?"  The Sage seemed to want to make the Odd One pay for the slightly
568 facetious replies he had gotten during his first few days with the Odd One.
569     "No it is no less than you have described, especially the metalwork on the
570 sides of entrances and thereabouts and around the windows too I have noticed. I
571 seem to aboil with all sorts of questions, dear fellow, will you ever have time
572 to answer even the slightest bit of any of them?"  Asked the Odd One, posing
573 the question of how much time he was going to spend with the Sage now.
574 
575     "Whenever you like, I never do anything around here that I would exclude
576 friends from, well,"  The Sage cleared his throat roughly, "A few other things
577 which do not bear mentioninhg."
578     "You wouldn't happen to have a vintnerage around here would you, friend?"
579 The Odd One was smiling so loudly the Sage had no heart to tell him no. And
580 they bounded off together in search of something, which may, or may not exist.
581 Which is, as I said before, nothing unusual is it?
