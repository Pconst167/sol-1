53 I want to change the subject for a time.  In my travels in the telephone
54 biz, I have chanced upon some interesting numbers for test purposes, etc.
55 For instance, if you want a 1004 Hz tone sent from the CO at 0 dBm (1 mW),
56 just dial any prefix followed by -1000 (e.g. 777-1000).  For a "quiet line"
57 (silent termination) use -2860 in PNB areas or -0032 for GTE (the quiet
58 line starts with a short period of 1004 Hz).  Some of the exchanges in PNB
59 have a nice sweep tone at -9999 (226-9999 works).  If you want to ring
60 your own phone, you have to know the proper prefix for your particular
61 exchange.  I only have these for 244 (521), 245 (541), 246 (551), and
62 293 (571).  The ring back is done by dialing your own suffix with the
63 special prefix.  When you have done this, you again get dial tone.  Then
64 "flash" (hold down the switch hook for about a half-second).  This will 
65 produce a higher pitched dial tone.  After you get the high tone, you can
66 hang up and your phone will ring.  You may test your TT pad by pressing all of
67 the digits 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0 after the dial tone first returns.  If you get 2
68 beeps, you're ok.  After testing, you can flash, get high tone, and hang up
69 to get rung back.
70   If anyone else has other "ring-back prefixes" or other numbers of 
71 interest, please share them with us.  For instance, in the SF Bay area,
72 there was a pair of numbers that sounded like silent terminations, but
73 if one party dialed the first number, and another party dialed the
74 second number, they would be connected together (great for secret
75 meetings where you don't want to give out your unlisted number).
76   Also, up until a month or so ago, the audio from NBS station WWV
77 (with time standards, etc.) was available locally.  You get
78 ATB tone there now.  Anyone know what happened (or alternate number)?

139 It consists of 3 32K roms that replace 2 roms in the unit.
140 In the normal mode all the function keys now do things like;
141 DIR and STAT and ERA and so forth.  In the alternate mode they
142 do things like ^KQ and ^QE and other neat things that don't mean
143 a thing unless you are using WordStar.  Also the special edit keys
144 now work like I thought they would when I bought this thing.....

156 SUBJ: AMODEM AND LINKASM
157 AMODEM IS GREAT!!  I'VE ASSEMBLED IT FOR MY KAYPRO II (FM YOUR 1.05
158 OF 29JUL82).  I'VE NOT USED LINKASM BEFORE.  IT WOULD BE MOST
159 CONVENIENT IF LINKASM WOULD LET ME SAY:  LINK B:<filename>  TO LET
160 ME DRIVE-DIRECT THE OPEN OF THE NEXT SOURCE MODULE.  IT DOESN'T
161 SEEM TO WANT TO LET ME.  MUST ALL MY SOURCE MODULES BE ON DRIVE A??
162 ALSO THE AMODEM VERSION I'VE ASSEMBLED GOES TO FAIRYLAND WHEN I TYPE 
163 "HELP HELP" TO THE MAIN COMMAND INPUT--IS THIS A BUG??
164 THANKS AGAIN FOR AMODEM.   9/24/82   -   A.TRENT
165 *******************************************************************
166 TO: ADAM TRENT       FM: MIKE DAY      RE: AMODEM
167 THANKS FOR THE COMMENTS. ALAS LINKASM DOES INDEED REFUSE TO ACCEPT
168 THE DRIVE DESIGNATOR. I AS YOU AM VERY DISHARTENED BY THIS, AND I
169 CONSIDER IT A MAJOR SHORTCOMING OF AN OTHERWISE EXCELENT PROGRAM.
170 AFTER STUDYING THE MATTER FOR A WHILE I THINK THAT REASON IT WAS
171 NOT DONE, IS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT INTO THE STUCTURE VARY WELL,
172 SO RATHER THEN TRY TO FORCE FIT SOMETHING WARD JUST DECIDED TO
173 DECLAIR IT INVALID AND SAY TOUGH LUCK. IT IS A SHAME AS I COULD
174 VERY DEFINATLY USE IT (I ONLY HAVE 171K ON A DRIVE, AND AMODEM
175 TAKES ALL OF THAT. I AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON VERSION 2 AND I
176 HAD TO GO BACK AND STIRIP OUT A LOT OF FANCY STUFF IN THE SOURCE
177 TO GET IT TO FIT ON ONE DISK (THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR
178 THE EXISTANCE OF THE COMPRESS PROGRAM THAT I WROTE.)
179   CONGRATES GO TO YOU !!! YOU HAVE FOUND AN ORIGINAL BUG. YES IT DOES
180 'GO AWAY' IF YOU TYPE 'HELP HELP'. IT APEARS THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU
181 CAN RECOVER FROM THIS IS TO RESET THE SYSTEM VIA THE PANIC BOTTON
182 IF YOU HAVE ONE, OR TO TURN IT OFF AND BACK ON IF NOT. I WILL FIX THIS
183 IN VERSION 1 THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER MINOR BUGS IN AMODEM WHICH
184 DO NOT AFFECT ITS FUNCTIONALLITY, IF YOU ARE USEING 2K OR LARGER BLOCKS
185 UNDER 2.X CPM IT WILL MISS CALCULATE THE SIZE OF ANY FILE THAT IS LARGER
186 THEN 16K. IT ALSO WILL NOT SHOW IN THE UNSORTED DIRECTORY ANY FILES
187 LARGER THEN 16K (THE SORTED DIRECTORY AND STATUS ARE OK THOUGH).
188 THIS IS ALREADY FIXED IN VERSION 2. (I FIXED THE DIRECTORY PROBLEM
189 BY PUNTING - I TOOK IT OUT! IT WAS TO COMPLEX TO FIX, SO I DECIDED
190 THAT THE SORTED DIRECTORY, STATUS, AND FILES WERE ENOUGH INFORMATION.

210 WELL, BWMS IS BACK AFTER A LONG AND AUDIUOS (OR IS THAT ODIOUS?) 
211 TIME AT THE OMSI COMPUTER FAIR. IT DID SURVIVE, BUT BEARLY DRIVE A
212 HAS PICKED UP SOME BEARING NOISE. I OILED THE BEARINGS WHICH HELPED
213 A LITTLE, BUT I THINK ITS DAYS ARE NUMBERED. (ANYONE WANT TO BUY A
214 VERY USED SA400 5 1/4 INCH DISK DRIVE CHEAP?? $50.00??) I WASN'T TOO
215 SURPRISED AT THIS AS IT HAS BEEN GETTING NOISIER FOR SOME TIME NOW.
216 AND WHAT WITH BEING RUN CONTINUOUSLY FOR THREE DAYS, IT DIDN'T HELP
217 IT ANY. THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE AT THE FAIR AND SAW BWMS KNOW WHAT IT
218 LOOKS LIKE. (CHEAP!!) IF YOU SAW THE MACHINE AT THE SAME BOOTH THAT
219 WAS RUNNING PACMAN, THAT IS MY OWN CPM MACHINE, THE HEATH MACHINE
220 THAT WAS RUNNING ADVENTURE WAS NOT MINE, BUT A CARBON COPY OF MY
221 H-8 THAT RUNS BEHIND BWMS (WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT MY H-8 HAS
222 ONLY 28K OF RAM CURRENTLY WHILE THE COPY HAS 64K.)
223 ***********************************************************

259      Enter the Dilettante, who wandered all over your curious blackboard,
260 electrons in her wake, investigating all the nooks & crannies to be found...
261 to come to the conclusion that there is tremendous potential for cryptic
262 communication through this MOST excellent medium... So who dares to answer?
263 I once scrawled a flippant piece here, alias Dragon Lady--do you remember?
264      I come looking for a certain Eridan, to tell him that I have found the
265 door, but it is locked.  When I knocked softly on it, a breath of air whispered
266 through the keyhole, but the words twined within it eluded me, if indeed there
267 were any words ... I stood and listened for an everlasting time, but there
268 was no more than the rustle of an imagined sigh ... My thoughts returned
269 to the words of a tax collector, found in a dusty scroll at Seven Seven ...

271 Mike,  I was indeed amazed at the torture that your disk drives took at the
272 OMSI outing.  All things considered, this system has been outrageously
273 reliable every time that I have used it over the last year.  My hearty
274 congratulations.
275      I don't know how other people felt, but I was largely bored by the
276 OMSI Computer Fair.  After you've seen 20 computers running various
277 versions of PACwoMAN, what's left?  The booths of CBBS and BWMS were
278 really the high points of the affair.

394 Let's get crazy all alone
395 Hold me closer than you'd ever dare
396 Close your eyes and I'll be there
397 And after all is said and done
398 After all, you are the one
399 
400 Take me up your stairs through the door
401 Take me where we don't care any more
402 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
403 I am that I am though I would be more. I ask for the one that 
404 is there to be found. I pray that I may find her to be. Though I
405 am here alone in my chamber of solitude, I know that it shall not
406 remain forever barren of the love that should be.
407 As I dream of the one that is to be, my thoughts drift lightly past
408 my court to the dank forest without. A shadow passes by and I follow
409 in the hopes of solving the mystery that was there.

413      The girl awakens with a start, and it is I, chilled to the bone from
414 the draft under the door.  Uncramping stiff muscles, I stumble to my feet
415 and gaze at it, still closed, massive in its indifference.  Realization
416 hits me like a bolt of lightning, and suddenly I am glad that it never
417 opened:  for it is the wrong door!  A voice almost fooled me into Believing
418 that my Eridan was listening ... but a stranger spoke to me.  With heavy
419 heart, I wrap my cloak around me, and continue in my desolate search.

427 Wandering thru empty rooms and rooms filled with treasure,
428 the Ghost spies out his universe and seeks to add to his lore,
429 Probing hidden corners, he wonders what is this creature
430 with jeweled scales that calls itself a dragon?
431 Whence it came and whither it goes?

447      She comes from far-away lands on golden wings, and if you come too close
448 her green eyes will turn to black and a delicate hiss will issue forth...
449 She is fascinated with enigmas and values intelligence, but knows empty eyes
450 when she faces them.  She is standoffish but never untrue.

452 As I wander through the forest dark, following the shadow that is not.
453 Slowly the dawn does rise to day. Soon I aproach a meadow of green green grass.
454 There in a concavity I see a creature divine. She glistens of green and gold.
455 A beauty to behold. As I stand with great trepidation, I hear a wisper ever
456 so weak. The words do come though the meaning unclear. The words are simple
457 though I do not fear, for the words are kind and do not hurt.
458 They simply state "Touch not the cat."

462      The girl has gone; and only a wraith-like fantasy creature remains...
463 cat? dragon?  wrought of electrons and imaginative dancing on the keyboard.
464 But remember:  such a beautiful thing cannot have a heart, so do not allow
465 yours any attachment.  It will not be long before it, too, will vanish as
466 my access to this world is cut off!  You have been warned.

472 The Ghost remains, for it is part of both worlds
473 Often silent, it is nevertheless there.
474 It too has traveled, but usually in a different

477 As the morning sun rises, the fog turns clear. With the fog goes the
478 creature of green gold. Once more am I alone in the land. 
479 Now I awake, yet once more do turn and open the shutters to greet the 
480 new day. The sun is shinning. The forrest is alive. Though the day
481 is new and beautifull and the sky filled with joy. There is yet a
482 pang of sorrow in my heart, for once more I am alone in my land.

484 In the room with the walls of fired clay, the small creatures lurk in
485 the shadows.  Working feverishly, they ignite the sacred flame and
486 inhale the wisp of smoke deep into their beings.  In the distance, the
487 aging maid shares the sorcery of the word... she cautions against having
488 two 'r's in forest, against having two 'l's in beautiful, and against
489 having two 'n's in shining.  The creatures in the room full of fog hear
490 not these warnings and forever are crippled in the mastery of the word.

507 I AM INTRIGUED BY THE NEW TWIST OF INNOVATIVE MESSAGES THAT ARE APPEARING
508 HERE. ALTHOUGH I CAN NOT BE SURE, I THINK THAT THIS IS INDEED A NEW FORM
509 OF USE FOR A MESSAGE SYSTEM. BUT THEN WITH BWMS BEING ON THE FORFRONT OF
510 THE UNUSUAL IS THIS NOT SO SURPRISING? ALL THAT I CAN SAY IS CARRY ON,
511 AND BRAVO!

520      Ah, your humbleness is refreshing, Believer!  The meaning is not lost,
521 only blurred--I merely am a striver for perfection, but I do not impose
522 my standards upon you people--nevertheless, note lines 47-48 on disk B
523 for questions on spelling; and if you wonder why I bother, my motivation
524 is clearly revealed by the words inscribed on 64-65.
525      Thank you very much, Mikey!  This system lends itself well to intrigue
526 because none but the unique would venture into such a place, and such ones
527 seem to be the only ones left with imagination and curiousity enough to
528 investigate the clouds of dust I stir up ... Were that there were more!

530 There are other lands where the inhabitants have

538 Though I am native to this land of dampness and green, I have been elsewhere
539 and come to love it yet even more. For the saying is wrong the grass is most
540 certainly not greener wither thou cannot see, but rather as Dorthy hath said
541 "There's no place like home!" I cannot abide those who would make of it less
542 then it is, or pretend that it be more. As I the land is what it is, and can
543 be no more. Though I fumble in fog and desperation, I yet still have left in

548      Names?  Lands?  Voices are wandering off on their own courses, wrapped
549 up in hearing their own sound; do they speak to get a response? ... Fantasy
550 lands, fantasy identities:  are they there only for the individual?  Are they
551 not to be shared and explored with other sensitive souls?
552 What do you truly believe in, Believer?  Is there peace in your eyes?
553 Tell me, Ghost:  is a slippery identity really what you value?  Where are
554 you going when you follow the wind?  How will you know when you get there?

557 Ponder this Inkeeper: Perhaps you should consider planting
558 a few green plants at the entrance of Backwater Inn, and
559 water them, perchance they will grow verdant green, mayhap
560 even bloom. Instruct thy servant in the ways of the gentle
561 folk, that they be greeted properly.

563 Dragon Lady: You came flitting into this dusty place,
564 a true spirit creature you. A dilitantte, do not touch
565 or get too close she says. She listens briefly to the 
566 Believer, then makes ready to flit on - but then,
567 she falls under the enchantment of the grey cat-ghost.
568 Too late!! The deed is done, the golden wings flutter
569 helplessly to the barren ground. Weep not my child,
570 for those wings will come again. But for now, how say you
571 Dragon Lady, can even the most dilatory mother abandon
572 her offspring? - I think not!
573 See you here, the old maid awakes, the sun rises
574 a fresh breeze wafts across the land.
575 Will not the land bloom and become known? And a fabulous
576 land indeed it might be. From my domicile at Two Towers
577 I look on and come to sup at the Inn.

597 I NOTE THAT YOU AS WELL AS THE OLD MAID TAKE NOTE OF THE DISREPUTABLE
598 SPELLING THAT OFT' OCCURS ON THIS SYSTEM. INDEED, IT OFTEN WOULD SEEM
599 THAT THIS IS IN ACTUALITY PERFORMED IF NOT IN A RECKLESS MANNER, THEN
600 QUITE POSSIBLY ON PURPOSE. THIS IN FACT EVIDENT A FEW OF THE SOMEWHAT
601 MORE DEBAUCHED MESSAGES WHICH RESIDE HERE. I AM HOWEVER NOT ONE KNOWN
602 TO THROW STONES LIGHTLY, AND AS SUCH I WILL LEAVE THAT ALONE. HOWEVER
603 THERE IS ONE ITEM OF NOTE THAT IS OFTEN MISSING THESE EXCLAIMATIONS I
604 HAVE FOUND, AND THAT IS THE TOTAL MISUSE AND ABUSE OF THE PUNCTUATION
605 THAT SURROUNDS THOSE WORDS. (I MYSELF AM OFTEN ONE OF THE MORE GUILTY
606 IN THIS.) SOMETIMES THE MEANING IS DEEPER THEN THE SURFACE APPEARANCE
607 HOWEVER; AS AN EXAMPLE, NOTE MY TITLE. AT FIRST GLANCE IT SEEMS TO BE
608 BUT A HUMORUS MISSPELLING OF A COMMONLY USED ABBREVIATION FOR SYSTEMS
609 OPERATOR. CLOSER EXAMINATION WILL SHOW THAT IT GOES DEEPER THAN THIS.
610 IF YOU LOOK IN YOUR DICTIONARY (AHH DO I HEAR THE RUSTLING OF PAGES?)
611 YOU WILL FIND AN INTERESTING DEFINITION ACCORDED THE WORD (I WOULD IN
612 HOPE THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT AN UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY.) THAT BEING OF
613 A TOMB OR CHEST. YET IF WE LOOK FARTHER, WE FIND THAT IT COMES FROM A
614 GREEK WORD 'CISTA'. IF WE LOOK YET EVEN FARTHER WE FIND THAT THIS WAS
615 ALSO USED FOR THE BASE OF THE WORD 'CISTERN', WHICH MAY BE DEFINED AS
616 A RESERVOIR OF WATER. (DOES THE MEANING NOW BECOME CLEARER?.........)
617 OF COURSE, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT SOME WILL MISTAKE IT AS SIMPLY A
618 MISSPELLING OF CYST, A SACLIKE STRUCTURE FILLED WITH DISEASED MATTER.
619 WHICH, A FEW WOULD CONSIDER BWMS TO BE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE MESSAGE
620 SYSTEM COMMUNITY. NO MATTER, YOU MAY CHOOSE THE DEFINITION YOU WISH..
