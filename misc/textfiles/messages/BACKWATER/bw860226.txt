25 "Eugene!"
26 Farley answered his aging ther from his workshop.  "YES?" he called back into
27 the kitchen.
28 "Quit working on that thing this minute.  Aren't you supposed to be on
29 vacation, or something?  You still haven't told me exactly where u're working
30 now, either.  Go play golf, or something.  Relax."
31 Farley wiped his hands on a rag as he walked into the kitchen.  "You always
32 did impore me to go outside and play, didn't you, mother?  Yes, well, I've
33 taken a short leave.  The company is a little-known...er...'investigation
34 agency'."
35 "Oh?  You're doing detective work again?  Does it pay well enough to keep up
36 this house of yours?"  With a sudden michevious smile, "Maybe I should hire
37 a maid."
38 Farley smiled back.  "If you say so, mom.  Look, I'm finishing my work now,
39 so I'll go o'out to play'.  All right?"
40 "Fine.  Pick up some bread on your way home?"
41 Farley assented then returned to the partially dassembled circuitry.  Ten
42 minutes later, it was mounted in a molded plastic case and laying on the
43 passenger side of Farley's pickup.  
44 Farley's comlink came to life, hidden in his pocket.  After he parked in the
45 lot of the golf course, he punched his access code into it.
46 <Another fine tidbit from: Ian MacHinery>
47 <Meeting, @ HQ conference room 792>
48 <Tuesday next.                 Ian>
49 <Ok, he's done now.>
50 Farley smireked a moment at the text.  The node-definable header/footer was one
51 of NET's recent improvements on their comlink system, and some agents, Farley
52 included, used it to poke a little fun at the management.  Ian probably knew
53 about every ddeviant header, but so far had done nothing about them.
54 Farley got out of his truck and took the box.  Time to test it without
55 interruptions, Farley thought.

57 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\45
58    Kerilli stepped in through the oaken door after the first crash. The trap had worked. In the center of the hall
59 stood Master Tremis, cloaked in the form of Void, throwing the young intruder around like a rag doll. Her first sight
60 of the infamous Destroyer was anticlimactic. He looked far too weak and fragile to be the unholy terror rumor had made
61 him out to be. Every time Master Tremis violently threw him against something, it seemed to do him little damage. He
62 continued to futilely try to grab the Master, but there was nothing to grab. His death was assured. Nevertheless, her
63 orders were to take no chances. She drew her sidearm.
64    It was a simple six-shot projectile weapon, the projectiles being cast of mithril silver. Each of the projectiles
65 had been put under a blood-curse of instant death. No power, physical or magical, would protect him from this potent
66 combination, which could break any magical spell in existence. It could even destroy Master Tremis, in his current
67 form. She would have to be very careful. She raised the gun and tried to center her aim on the slim figure of the
68 Destroyer...
69    James tried to breathe and choked on blood instead. His entire body was a giant ball of pain. At least half his
70 ribs were cracked. If not for his power, he would have been splattered by now. As it was, he wouldn't take much more
71 anyway. What breath he had managed was driven out of him as he was slammed into a marble pillar.
72    He had to get loose. He couldn't touch the giant, or make him let go. This was it. He was finally going to die.
73 What surprised him the most was how little it bothered him. What did bother him was that he couldn't keep his promise.
74 Through bloodied lips, he whispered, "I'm sorry, Tariya. I can't-"
75    The giant swung him around and was suddenly flying through the air. He retained enough of his wits to land on his
76 feet and wondered the giant had let go. He looked down and saw that most of the front of his jacket was gone. The
77 giant was holding the remnants in its fist. The fabric had torn under the stress. James smiled. He had a
78 chance.
79    There was a huge bang and something zipped by his head. Painfully he ducked and saw the woman in the doorway with
80 the .38 Special. She fired again, missing by a wider margin. Thankfully she wasn't a crack shot. The giant was the
81 bigger threat.
82    Big but slow. James ran past it, ducking under it's grasp. Now he was back by the table. The occupants were still
83 in the trance, giving no sign that they were aware of him. he jumped the table and stood next to one old man. He
84 grabbed the body, which was like grabbing a window dummy. This guy was out of it. He grabbed the man's head and
85 twisted. Something went pop in the neck and the body went limp. James suddenly felt sick.
86    But the giant staggered and seemed to shrink perceptibly. James knew he was on the right track. They were protected
87 from magical attacks but not physical ones. The giant reached him but he easily eluded its grasp again. He grabbed
88 another body and broke its neck, too.
89    Kerilli was outraged. She watched as he murdered two of the planets leaders and foremost citizens. But she was torn
90 by indecision. That he had loved Tariya there was now no doubt. Why else would he be this determined? Killing him
91 would be betraying her memory. And he thought he was doing the right thing, whether he really was or not. The council
92 was dangerously close to bringing all of civilization down in ruins with this war. But her alliegiences had always
93 been with the council ad her oldest brother Anlak.
94    Unfortunatly, the next body James grabbed was Anlak's. She made her desicion right there. Centering the sights on
95 the center of his chest, she fired.
96    James spun around as the bullet smashed into his right side. He collapsed against a wall but didn't quite fall.
97 With his left hand, he felt the wound. The bullet had gone through clean, missed the lung, and was already healing.
98 But he didn't have the time! The giant was...
99    Right in front of him.
100    He couldn't resist as the huge, nebulous hads grasped him. The giant turned him around and held him by the
101 shoulders, then turned to face the woman with the gun. From out of nowhere, it's voice echoed, "Take no chances. Use
102 the weapon now."
103    "With pleasure." she replied grimly. She centered the gun on his chest again and squeezed slowly, just like her
104 instructor had taught her.
105    "Surprise." James mumbled. The giant had made the mistake of holding him by the jacket again. Gritting his teeth
106 from the pain, he threw his arms up. Gravity did therest, and he slithered out of the jacket. Not completely, but
107 enough.
108    Kerilli didn't notice until too late. The gun bucked and roared in her hands. The bullet passed right by James'
109 left ear and through the jacket into the giant. The power that had been bound to Master Tremis was released very
110 suddenly and violently.
111    James regained conciousness an eternity later. He managed to sit up, but just barely. The entire hall was in ruins.
112 Nothing was intact, including the occupants. A telekinetic shield saved his life, but apparently nobody else had been
113 that lucky. He had fulfilled his vow.
114    He turned at a scraping sound behind him, instantly regretting the sudden move. From out of the shadows in the back
115 of the chamber emerged a huge figure of a woman, dressed in the same finery as the others had been. But he had never
116 seen her before. In a strong, approving voice, she announced, "Well done, very well done. Couldn't have done it better
117 myself." He stared at her for a long minute. Finally, she asked, "Do you know who I am?"
118    He stared at her for several long minutes before he finally spoke. "I knew your daughter."

121    The Hell Machine
122          (1)
123    
124    GGGRRRRRRRRRRIIIIINNNNNDDD!!!
125    Being a friday, the traffic on the 205 bridge was fairly heavy. Roy Karsten was heading across for Portland in his
126 little four-banger Datsun pickup. It was a warm, half-cloudy September afternoon and he maght have actually enjoyed the
127 ride except for two little problems. One was the leather briefcase that sat on the seat beside him. The other
128    KAA-RRRUUNNNNKKK!!!
129 was the fact that he couldn't get the $%#@&%@@&!! truck into fourth gear. He had the clutch jammed to the floor but
130 every time he tried to slip the gearshift into the notch it adamantly refused to cooperate and instead responded with a
131 clashing of teeth deep in the
132    KAA-RRRUUNNNNKKK... GRRRIIINNNDDD!!!
133 transmission that set his own teeth on edge. The speedometer was down to 45 now and slowly dropping. This was the last
134 thing he needed now. Earlier he had called the group at the research center with his findings. After a lot of arguing
135 he managed to get Frank to hold the experiment at least until he could get there and show them the figures on paper. He
136 was convinced he was right. If the Genesis machine worked, they could all be in serious trouble. Roy suspected his
137 calculations showed only a fraction of the machine's true potential.
138    WHAM! WHAM!
139    The truck shook every time the gears clashed. Roy had a sneaking hunch that the transmission, and probably the whole
140 truck, was nearing the end of its useful life. The transmission had been giving him problems lately, but nothing like
141 this. He didn't have the foggiest what was wrong. He was a mathmetician, not a mechanic. The needle quivered just below
142 forty. At the rate he was going, he wouldn't even make it halfway across the bridge. Roy slammed his foot on the clutch
143 hard, put both hands on the gearshift knob, gritted his teeth, and jerked the lever into the notch as hard as he
144 could.
145    GGGGGGGRRRRRRRR... KA-WHAAAMMM!!!
146    The tiny truck shuddered like a bomb had gone off in the bed, but the $%#&*! lever finally slipped into the fourth
147 gear slot. In fact, Roy discovered, it now went into all the slots easily. Even after he let up on the clutch. When he
148 pressed the accelerator, the engine raced freely. Uh-oh.
149    The needle now eased down past thirty. Some creep in a Camaro shot around him at seventy, blasting on the horn.
150 After wearing out every carnal verb in his vocabulary, Roy decided he's better get this heap into the breakdown lane
151 before it stopped completely. Fortunately he was facing downhill and had enough momentum to ease it all the way over to
152 the right. He heard gravel crunch under his tires as he pulled over and it finally occurred to him that he should turn
153 on the four-way flashers. Since he had no parking brake, he grabbed the knob and put it it in reverse so it wouldn't
154 roll downhill. He stared in astonishment as the lever came loose in his hand. Smoke drifted up from the hole in the
155 transmission hump. The truck was still slowly moving so he had only one choice. He eased the wheel slightly to the
156 right, gritting his teeth as first the right fender, then the whole side of the truck, ground against the concrete
157 barrier. He was ready to jump out if the barrier showed any sign of breaking, but finally the truck stopped.
158    He got out and slammed the door, still holding the gearshift lever. Cars were zooming by uncomfortably close in the
159 next lane. Still cursing a blue streak, Roy stomped around to the front of the truck and kicked it hard enough to break
160 the plastic grille. Jesus, what else could go wrong? He noticed the lever in his hand for the first time and flung it
161 out over the barrier. It flew in a long graceful curve, catching splinters of sunlight, before splashing in the water
162 one hundred thirty feet below.
163    Enough temper tantrums, he told himself. First priority was getting those papers to the lab. Pressing up against the
164 body of the truck to present as small a target as possible to oncoming traffic, he edged his way back to the cab. He
165 retrieved his case through the open window and made his way forward again. He put his thumb out and began walking down
166 the road, more than a little concious of the barrier beside him. Not even waist high, it was the only thing
167 "protecting" him from a thirteen story drop.
168    Forty minutes later, he was still walking. Nobody had even slowed down. Most of the cars had Oregon plates, which
169 explained a lot. Oregon drivers were the most inconsiderate in the entire country. At least Frank was holding the
170 experiment, or so he hoped. If they fired that thing up...
171    He caught a movement out of the corner of one eye. There was something happening in the east.
172    They hadn't waited. There was no logical basis for this assumption but he knew it to be true all the same. It was
173 the only explanation for what he was watching. The briefcase fell from nerveless fingers.
174    A certain well-known landmark in the east had just... disappeared. In its place was a huge grey-black dome rising
175 for the sky. The very clouds were being pulled in towards it. He didn't know exactly what had happened, but he could
176 make a darn good guess. The entire tableau was taking place in hellish silence, but he would hear it soon enough. It
177 about three and a half minutes, if he guaged the distance correctly. Traffic was still speeding by, but a few vehicles
178 were slowing down as they noticed what was happening. He knew he was in mortal danger, but there was nowhere to run,
179 nowhere to hide. He should have stayed with the truck.
180    Besides, he wasn't nearly as concerned for his own safety as he was for the safety of the world.
181

184 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
185   Struggling, like the silver flash of a hooked fish, the piper was being
186 drawn to the body beneath him.  The silver cord pulled slowly and steadily,
187 drawing the piper to return to the body that normally housed him.  With the
188 pull came memory -- memory of pain so intense that the piper writhed trying
189 to remain in this state, this state of peaceful floating.
190   Gritting his teeth (did he have teeth in this state? No matter, he gritted
191 what felt like teeth.), he reached down to the silver cord that stretched
192 between his navel and the body below, grasped the wrist-thick cord with
193 both hands and pulled *away* from his body.
194   Between his hands, the cord thinned, stretched, dropping in size from the
195 thickness of one of his wrists to that of his thumb, his fingers, smaller,
196 to the thickness of a small string, to thread.  Alarmed, he stopped, looked,
197 and found himself in a far, far distant place than that of the recumbent 
198 body that had called him.
199   He seemed to be floating in a space filled with clouds, above a vast plane
200 of clouds, beneath a sky hidden in mists.  A slight haze filled the space
201 between, hiding the details of the distance in an opalescent glow.  The
202 silver cord that tethered him was vanishingly small, disappearing into the
203 distance scant inches from his navel.  Suddenly the enclosed space rang,
204 a deep, pervasive vibration like the chimes of a world-sized gong, the tolling
205 of the hours of a clock that ticked off eternities as its seconds.
206   The entire scene vibrated, shimmered, and distorted as though it were seen
207 through water suddenly disturbed.  Shimmered, distorted, *flowed*, and 
208 reformed into a different scene...
209 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

217     "Bard, my friend, your emotion clouds your vision. The signs are there, but
218 you refuse to see. Perhaps it is my fault forgetting that not all have the
219 vision of truth I am sometimes allowed to observe. Piper, in his mind, if not
220 his soul, has made his wishes known. We must not interfere. Milchar has made
221 a big mistake with the healing. He did not heed my words. Bard, you are right
222 in one respect. We must let Piper decide. In order to do that, we must leave
223 nature unhindered..."
224     A pounding interrupted Cragmore. Bard went to investigate the sound. 
225 Cragmore bent down and looked at Piper's face. Eyes can not see what transpires
226 in the mind, nor what the soul endures, but psi replaces iris, cone, rod, lens,
227 and optical nerve, and opens a whole new world of sight. Cragmore could see,
228 through his power, a glimpse of what the spirit of Piper was now witnessing.
229     "Piper... Piper " Cragmore whispered, "let go if you must. Return if you
230 will. Judge with your heart and your head what to do. Your friends fight for
231 your life, not knowing what is wrong from what is right. I strive to 
232 understand, but I can't make others understand. I will protect your state as
233 much as I can, but I can not promise. You, who helped Trainor, who helped
234 Innkeeper, who helped others I have only head tales about, you, must be the
235 one."
236     There was no way of knowing whether or not Piper received and understoof
237 (d) the message. Cragmore could only hope its course was straight and true and
238 Piper was able to comprehend its source and its meaning. Just then, another
239 voice caused Cragmore to do a quick about-face.
240     "Cragmore! I thought I recognized your robes. How did you get here?"
241 The Innkeeper, looking slightly the worse for wear, stood next to Bard. The
242 pounding had been the kindly Innkeep wishing to get in from out of the cold.
243     Bard smiled. "Just look at what the cat brought in, Cragmore." Then Bard's
244 smile quickly dissipated. "How  is Piper? Any changes?"
245     "He's still alive if that's what you mean. But I must insist that you don't
246 touch him. This is a very delicate time."
247     "So he can die?" Bard's face revealed feeling rarely seen in the songmaster.
248     "What?" Innkeeper broke in. "Piper, dying? What's going on here?"
249     "It's a long story," Bard replied, "but basically Piper followed you into
250 this alternate local, and of course, didn't fare very well in the atmosphere. I
251 found him and brought him into my ship. He was bleeding internally. Milchar
252 arrived," Bard pointed to the exhausted mage asleep on one of the ship's
253 couches, "and started a healing process. Then Cragmore arrived..."
254     "I was following Milchar," interrupted Cragmore, "and stumbled onto the
255 ship. And..."
256     Bard broke in again, "...and Cragmore says that Piper wants to die. And I
257 am quite puzzled and more than a little dismayed at that sentiment."
258     Innkeeper shifted his gaze from Bard, to Cragmore, to the prone figure of
259 Piper lying on the medical couch, but before he could say anything, Cragmore
260 spoke again.
261     "Speaking of which, Innkeeper, how are you able to be roaming about in this
262 most inhospitable environment? I don't see any breathing apparatus under your
263 apron"
264     "That's what I'd like to know too." continued Bard.
265     "That friends, is another long story. But it can wait. What are we going
266 to do about Piper?"

272 didn't affect you? How come you are beat up
273 so much but it never really hurts you? How
274 come you write so much about the pain but
275 it never slows you down? How can you be
276 jumping around dodging monsters with a bunch
277 of broken ribs? Have you ever had broken
278 ribs? How come you put yourself into one
279 impossible situation after another but
280 always seem to get out with ease? And how
281 come I have no doubt about the ending of

287 SLOI: In answer to some of your questions:
288 Had he been an ordinary mortal, James would be long dead by now. His power, 
289 which is an intimate part of his being (unlike some here) can be used both
290 conciously and unconciously. When he is injured, but still must take physical
291 action, his power will take over, artificially keeping his going after his
292 last episode, he was using his limited energy like crazy, draining himself 
293 badly. Maybe he got out with relative ease (more a matter of limited writing
294 space that anything else. I can't make it too complicated for that reason)
295 but there is a price to pay. As for the death bullets, well, maybe I fudge a
296 little there, but my theory is that he did not take a lethal hit, and so
297 survived. He has survived lethat wounds before, but had the bullet struck home,
298 he would not have survived that one.
299 My fault, I should have perhaps made the point clearer.
300 I don't know why you think you know how the story's going to end, but I would
301 be very interested in hearing what you think will happen. I doubt very much
302 you know all of it, yet. But go ahead and tell me, please.

315 Piper Dying? No! That can't be! And he did it trying to save me. I feel
316 guilty somehow. My stupidity and clumsiness has caused this. Isn't there
317 anything that can be done? #There is nothing. The body is whole, but the
318 mind is unstable. We can only wait. There is nothing anyone can do. He
319 must heal himself. We can offer him our support and confidence. It *is* felt,
320 but we cannot force it.# I echoed to the others what my new found "friend"
321 said. "We must wait, offer our support, but let him work it out. The body
322 is whole, it will survive as long as Piper wants to live. Pray my friends,
323 let him know you care. He can hear you if you really do care."
324 <cough> <hack> <cough> All the talking caused me to go into convulsions.
325 I was coughing up streems of yellowish green fluid. #Don't worry about it,
326 we just have to clean out the cloroxide converters from your lungs now that
327 you are in an oxigen atmosphere. It will be over in a few minutes.#
328 <cough> <hack> <hack> <cough>. The coughing was intense and painful. So
329 much so that I fell to the floor holding my arms around my chest trying
330 to squeeze out the pain. "It hurts", I managed to gasp between fits.

332 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
333 Milchar's eyes fluttered open, and he took in the scene without moving his
334 head.  At first he stared blankly, then by degrees he remembered what had
335 happened.  The Innkeeper's presence surprised him.  And wasn't that Cragmore?
336 Milchar's eyes refused to focus properly, and little bits of his body 
337 complained about the cold to which it hdad been subjected.  Long hours would
338 be spent, later, to recover his magic power reserve.  Overall, he placed his
339 condition into the category of 'poor, but stable'.
340 Piper, however, was not even stable.  Milchar had worked hard with what
341 knowledge he had, but only a little time for Piper was purchased with his coin.
342 A strong will to live might enable him to recover completely, even now.
343 "Has Piper's codition changed?" Milchar asked, somehow managing to make
344 himself heard over the Innkeeper's sudden violent coughing.
345 Bard, startled, answered the mage that he had thought was comatose.  "No.
346 He still breathes, buthe blood has stopped."
347 "You should not have tried to heal him," Cragmore said.
348 Anger flared within the mage.  Anyone watching except a psi talent would not
349 have noticed, so tight was Milchar's control on it.  He merely said in a calm
350 voice, "I will do whatever is necessary to save the life of a friend."
351 Bard interrupted.  "Cragmore says Piper wishes to die."
352 Milchar considered this.  "If so, I wish to hear it from his lips, and to be
353 able to say goodbye."
354 An awkward silence decended upon five (even the Innkeeper's coughing had
355 subsided), as if each held his breath in anticipation.

357 Hello, I like the Destroyers story too,but I was confused about the death
358 bullet myself.He admitted himself that it should have been made a bit more
359 clear.
360 Oops almost forgot my name: Madwand
361 ....And the sun shines gaily on the mountain tops..I took a trip on a sailin' ship and when I reached Jamaica I made a
362 top...    The words floated lazily along the white sand, across tables of wondrous eyed tourists, chatting irreverently
363 , uncaring of tradition, of the steel drums, of the romance of the island, impressed more by the tiny paper umbrellas
364 that garnished drinks they could not ask for by name. They were tolerated. They spent tourist dollars and gawked at
365 whatever they had never seen in Des Moines or Sheboyagan. Naitive Jamaicans insulted them at every opportunity; they
366 ate it up. Unknowing...naive...
367    The sun sets slowly in the Caribbean, treating the islanders to a magnificent spectacle of which they never tire.
368 The tourists glance, "nice sunset.."; and go back to talk of home, and who's minding the hardware store back in Omaha.
369 They gather together for inexplicable reasons and they always say-"Your'e American? Why so are we! Isn't it a small
370 world?" I'm Jerry, and this is my wife Anna. We're from Vincennes, Indiana. The balding man puffs his chest out as
371 he proudly informs his new captive audience that he owns Taylors Dry Cleaning and Tailoring, and that they have been
372 married for seven thousand years...
373 
374 The man in the ever blase', ever acceptable Panama suit had heard it a hundred times before. No stranger to the Islands.
375 He looked at his watch again-it was almost time. Signaling to the tablewaiter for another Scotch, he then took from
376 his jacket pocket, a hand held transciever.
377 He pushed the transmit button with his thumb, and spoke:"com-link access echo bravo three delta three foxtrot three
378 operation overlook sierra whiskey niner niner seven."
379 Unseen by the glib tourists, immersed in their long awaited vacations, un noticed by the musicians, the native dancers
380 a Boeing DC-3 Dakota was circling above at flight level 34. 
381 The transmission from the ground was relayed via Comsat III to a group of anxious men in a small room in Alaska.
382 
383 At the end of the message, Lou punched a key on one of the IBM PC's, and paper spewed from a printer. Delta Five spoke:
384 "OK, gentlemen, we all know what our next move is. It's time to get moving..."

402 Destroyer: As unpopular as it may seem on this board, I enjoy your
403 entries particularly when you seem to know where your story is headed.
404 Although I don't read all the stories on this board, I'll read those
405 that get my attention.  Suffice it to say that I've read several of your
406 entries and have enjoyed many of them.  I welcome all those who try to write
407 something here besides one-line cutsies and other such nonsense.
408 I have contributed little literary-wise (so far) and respect those who have
409 the time and patience to churn out entry after entry.  The tale I am working
410 on is coming along slowly and I am hesitant to put up a single entry until
411 the work is completed.  I suppose this is a matter of taste as well as style.
412 Anyway, though the end of your story is nearing, I encourage you to keep
413 writing.  For writing is a skilled art and like any art requires practice to
414 acquire proficiency.

478 You could think of a "cutesie one-liner" as a pin, and a large entry as a balloon.  
479 Possibly filled with lots of hot air.  Looks big and significant, but is really
480 small and insignificant.  Takes a lot of time to enter.  Then along comes the
481 one-liner, and pops the balloon.  Bang!  Naturally, the person who put in the
482 longer entry is embarrassed.  He's been exposed.

492 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
493     From Prometheus; Awaited
494     It is amazing to see the number of names people an get for themselves.  I
495 am willing to bet each of us has at least four spread over the archives.  When
496 the number of these are disclosed, it is amazing to learn.  This person said
497 this about that, and hates this person, and lusts after this other person.
498     If the owners of the one line cutsies were to be known, I am sure it would
499 be more amazing than even that.  This person is a jerk, did her have to say
500 that about that person, what an idiot, I wish I could write like he does, and
501 a lot of other reactions could result.
502     While I enjoy shifting names and even the personification of each name, the
503 one line cutsies are never much fun. They are glaring insults and this is what
504 I propose we do to abolish them forever.
505     Our friendly neighborhood system operator might declare that all entries
506 have signatures of one kind or another.  This policy would be ignored by some,
507 it is obvious.  IFf stuck to though, it might create a nasty feeling of being
508 a deviant, and someone would feel rightfully guilty for it.  Eventually, there
509 would probably be a lot less one liners around.
510     So, does anyone else think we should ask for signatures on all entries?
511 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
512 
513 no

515 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
516 Signatures? How? I doubt very much Mikey has the time to enforce such a 
517 policy.
518 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
519 "Signatures"? I think you are missing the idea-of what Backwater is all about.
520 To above: The 'delphi' entry was addressed to me by some juvenile mind whose IQ
521 is equal to the number of keys on his Commodore. If he (it) does not like
522 what I write, then he should not read same. It always amuses me that small
523 minds imply anonymously, criticisms when they can't think of anything con-
524 structive to say, or interesting to write. Backwater has always had, and 
525 will always have, such creeps. I have found that a dose of Nunchuka liberally
526 applied to the back of the head teaches them some mnners. [*=*] DELTA FIVE [*=*

528 Delta V: IQ=no. of keys on his 64?  Ouch, that hurt.  Hope you don't
529 mean the rest of the 64 owners out there (including myself) who are too
530 impoverished to purchase anything more expensive (implied: 'better').
531 Going to print out & re-read Piper's entry.

533 Milchar: No, not at all. Only children like the jerk that likes to fill the disk with garbage, as was above. (Thanks
534 Mikey) For some reason that person (?) does not like me. Wish I knew (for sure) who it is. I would give them a REAL
535 reason not to like me.  How's school? How would you like to be reminded that finals week is before us.Sorry, that was
536 mean, but some nice guy on the Parrot just reminded me...so I thought... [*=*] DELTA FIVE [*=*\

547 To above: I don't give a ---- what you like or don't like. Are you the jerk (jerk in lieu of stronger words) that 
548 s been filling the disks with garbage? If so, read the mail I left for you on the board you suggested.And please don't
549 continue to use up space with garbage. It doesn't hurt me, but it does cause inconvenience to other users, as well 
550 as taking Mikey's time to delete it. I love this BBS and am very loyal to it, and have no use for people who abuse it.

557 Yes, indeed, I "hold grudges". I get mad *and* I get even. It's how I am. McKane has caused me irreparable grief, 
558 and I am out to get him. You can join forces with us and wear a white hat, or you can just sit back and observe.

618 give it a try, from now on no response to any unsigned message.  Perhaps
