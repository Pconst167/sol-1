32 
33 A thousand books, they line the wall,
34 But I can say, I've read them all.
35 A thousand lives, they've let me live,
36 Oh how much, these books can give.
37 
38 The cover blurbs, the ads do hide,
39 What greater wonders that are inside.
40 No cover art can begin to sell,
41 What authors with their words do tell.
42 
43 I ask my friends for their wise voice,
44 I've learned to trust their good advice.
45 They all have read so far and wide,
46 But our tastes are similar, and I abide.
47 
48 I buy my books right off the rack,
49 The seller smiles, and says, "You're back!"
50 The transaction takes but a little time,
51 And I am left with just a dime.
52 
53 I hurry home, I can hardly wait,
54 All obstacles to me they grate.
55 When I get a book I seem almost possessed,
56 But when I get home into it I digress.
57 
58 Once I start to read a book,
59 I'm like a fish caught on a hook.
60 Like a whirl my mind goes 'round.
61 I dare not put this new book down.
62 
63 The pages turn, the story flows,
64 I'm sure the joy, on my face shows.
65 No greater wonder, a book can bring,
66 My soul does dance, my soul does sing.
67 
68 The fire I started to warm myself,
69 Now starts to fade, dying in stealth.
70 I must not stop, this book can't shut,
71 Nothing seems important, except Kurt Vonnegut.
72 
73 The pages fly, I'm almost done,
74 I glance to see the setting sun.
75 The last page turned, its words I read.
76 It's then the book completes my need.
77 
78 The cover closed, the story done,
79 With another book I am now one.
80 I can't forget the book just read:
81 The sights, the scenes, what characters said.
82 
83 Their words, actions, they remain with me.
84 I will always remember their agony.
85 A book when done, becomes a part
86 Of any reader who has a heart.
87 
88 My words are few but my thanks are many,
89 to authors with their horns of plenty.
90 My world is larger, I have learned so much.
91 I do love my books, and the writer's touch.

147 Sranul: I believe that Vidtex and CompuServe use CTRL-C a lot, something that
148 dumps you out of enter mode.  (The line you were typing when your terminal
149 sends a CTRL-C is lost.)  Try another terminal program; public domain ones 
150 abound.
151 Person on bottom of DB: I'm intrigued.  Unfortunately, since the system I'm
152 running is a C64, no UNIX is available.  I haven't access to anything else.
153 It's good to know such programs exist, though...
154 NEW POET: Thank you, I enjoyed that poem immensely.
155 L'homme: I think direct vocal landline connection is called for; a few
156 concepts in our storyline need clearer definition.  I'm still working, so the

194     Within the dash-panel of Carmichael's van; Freida, it's silicon brain 
195 quietly meditated.  It refused to start for the station attendent who wanted
196 to move it from infront of the pumps.
197     As soon as he slamed it's door and walked away, however, it rolled coop-
198 eratively out of the way and parked itself.  When sad purveyor of petrol 
199 attempted to reopen it's door by force, ostensably to see if the brake was set
200 all he got for his trouble was a nasty electrical shock.
201      006.95 however was having problems of his own!  As he ate the salad 
202 preparied for him, odd scraping noises cept disturbing his otherwise inner
203 rejuvinating fantasies.  
204      Hunger partialy abaited, quriosity got the better of his attention.  
205      Only then did he explor the other leg of the inner space.
206      It proved to have no exits.  There was a modicum of dust, tough still
207 less than the outer chaimber.  Dwarfed by an otherwise seamingly large expance
208 of wall was a small wall mounted tool holder,  seamingly at home in it were
209 varios instruments whose only common charicteristic was thair potential to
210 induce human pain.
211        in the center of this space, hung upside down by the ankles with heavy
212 chains attached to quaint hinged wrot-iron manicles, closed with modern 'master'
213 padlocks, was a young man of vaguely familiar appearence.  His wrists were
214 secured and seperated by weld-carved steel chanel bars bolted togather.  
215 attop these bars sat a variety of lead weights.  The man, mercifully uncon-
216 cios was breathing and thus presumably still alive.
217       Carmichael had just removed the weights and sat them on the floor when
218 he heard the outer door scraping open.

221    The next few days were a blur to Harold.  Hurry up and wait.  Stand in 
222 line for everything, from breakfast to a chance to use a bathroom.
223 His time wasn't wasted, however.  The non-commissioned officers in charge of
224 loading the white cells into the vessels that were to carry them to their 
225 eventual destination made sure of that.  There's something about certain
226 personality traits that attracts non-coms, stance, gait -- who knows what?
227 Harold had it.  He could be pulled out of a milling herd of thousands of
228 conscriptees.  Whenever there was a sidewalk to polish, window to sweep,
229 or wall to mop, the local non-coms went out and picked out a conscriptee.
230 More often than not, that conscriptee was Harold.  At last, after an
231 interminable wait, he came to the head of the queue.  Before boarding the
232 vessel, he hesitated slightly, but finally boarded with a sense of adventure
233 to come.  Bravely, he merged with the onrushing crowds.

237 Piper you story reminds me of the similar skit in Woody Allen's "Everything
238 You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask." Except in the
239 Woody Allen film, it wasn't disease the various parts of the body were
240 fighting. However, your story is fun to read nonetheless. Please continue.

250        Tales of a Forgotten Land
251    Why the land was forgotten is easy. Ithas no banks, no credit cards o
252 t anyone recognised was the 1 Dairy Queen that only had fudge ice cream, 
253 and in today's high tech and r-rated society that is not enough to ease 
254 enter into the hearts of those foolish enough to journey into this land, 
255 which there weren't many of. 
256 a person. His life had been miserable. All 26 of his years on this planet 
257 chain. "What a place for a life." he said, one brisk morning when the
258 breeze was cool, the sun was hot, and love was in the air. Love saw Jeff
259 and decided to find some young couple rolling o about on a hill somewhere
260 so it left. But Jeff didn't care. Thiswas xis life and he WANTED it to be
261 a bjob so far, and he didn't want to ruin his record. He entered the D
262 place where the Dairy Queen was. A smoke filled man greeted him. The room 
263 wasn't filled with smoke untill the man exhaled. Then a smoke filled ro
264 room greeted him. It said "Howdy" and ran anway. HJeff watched it leave.
265    He fished through his pockets, which was a sport on the planet Earth 
266 eeryone, man or woman, adult or child, even the Kangaroos did. Of course 
267 at trophy that the Australin 
268 had won.

285 had some problems with the system that
286 I have been running, and would like and
287 would greatly appreciate some suggestion
288 s. I have a new program running that I
289 wrote 2 days ago. I'm not sure what
290 your reaction would be to it, mainly
291 because it is "Extremely" similar to
292 this Discwrite program. I certainly dont
293 want to step on any toes. So if you

295 things with no problem. Give the system

308 Milchar and Grann carefully boarded the strange device that had whirred down
309 the corridor towards them.  It quickly whisked them to the control room of
310 the TARDIS, not too much the worse after the trip.
311 A rather thin figure wrapped in exceedingly tacky clothing, among which a
312 twenty-six foot long scarf showed itself prominently, was huddled over the
313 controls dealing with course setting of the TARDIS.  The Doctor had given
314 Milchar a brief overview of which sections of buttons and levers did what
315 some time ago, for fear that otherwise he might accidently touch something
316 they'd both regret.  Milchar, of course, was naturally a bit surprised to see
317 a strange box-like object attached to the temporal control section.  Milchar
318 began to open his mouth to say something when the Doctor spoke up.
319 "Well, Milch, Glad to see you.  And who's that?  Never mind for now, you must
320 be tired.  I'll just finish the plotting while you ask me your two questions,
321 and then we'll retire to get a drink somewhere.  At least ONE of the sections
322 should have a working dispenser."
323 "This is Grann, my pupil," Milchar began, taking one thing at a time, as
324 he always did.  "As for my questions, I fear you know me too well.  I was
325 going to ask what that box was, and also where K-9 is."
326 "Those are simple enough," the Doctor said.  "I don't know what that box is,
327 and I don't know where K-9 is, either.  Actually, I was travelling to Gallifrey
328 to find out.  There is some wonderful probing equipment there.  A few spatial-
329 temporal tracers ought to be able to zero in on K-9, only a matter of 
330 triangulating spatial position first, then temporal 'position'.  Now, tell me,"
331 the Doctor said, "What exactly are YOU doing here?"
332 Briefly, Milchar gave an account of what had happened to them.  Grann might
333 have been embarrassed about his failed spell, but the stubborn gnome refused
334 to show it.
335 "Hmmm, I never did like mucking about with forces that act like magic does.
336 Why, just look at it!  Follows absolutely no rules most of the time, and the
337 ones that exist seem to be able to be bent and twisted into pretzels.  And
338 where in the universe does the bloody energy COME FROM?  Hmmmmm?  Sometimes
339 I think your 'mastery' of this misbegotten force is merely fantastic luck.
340 Why I haven't ripped up your books and your cards I'll never know."
341 Milchar stood amused through the Doctor's ranting, knowing full well that
342 deep down he respected it.  The Doctor never did like to give much credit to
343 something he wasn't a master in dealing with himself.
344 The Doctor finished his tirade, seeing that once again it failed to have any
345 impact on his audience.  Despite his apparent failure, he led the group to
346 a lounge with a faint smile on his face.
347 "Well," he said as they sat down, "you wouldn't want to come along to
348 Gallifrey with me, would you, Milch?  Of course, Grann too.  Didn't you say
349 you had some spare time?"

371     Traffic is still somewhat confused but starting to resume normal speed.
372   The amount of usage appears to have rissen (though this may partialy resault
373 from the comentary lanes heving been relocated integral with those destined
374 for fantasy exits.  Travelers are warned to avoid the question mark which 
375 seems to remain in limbo.  Also there seems to be some slight delay in open-

382     Carmichael Sean was once again seated in front of his salad by the time 
383 the door to the inner room grated opened.
384     Outside, Freida the van took another unscheduled excursion.  Accross the
385 highway was a large tuffa formation.  Freida parked on the highway side, due
386 east of it.  The only human eye to observe this was a young paiute five miles
387 away with a pair of 50x70 binoculars.  What he did not see was that the van 
388 was unoccupied at the time.  He did think it odd though that no driver got out
389 for the five minuets he continued to watch, but then he shrugged his shoulders
390 and turned away.  There were other matters to occupy his attention.
391       'Have you met your new roomate yet?' Carmichael's captor asked in a
392 cheerfully genial manor.
393       09 looked up, muttering unconcerned around a mouthfull of salid that he
394 hadden't seen anyone.
395       'You must be auffly hungry to be careless enough not to look around any
396 more than that!'  A slight chill started to work its way up Car'l's spine.  
397 #So this is what 'field work' is all about#, he thought to himself, #no wonder
398 Ambassidor Themnax's localy hired under-secretaries were called 006.95's.  
399 Actualy that bit of jargon had entered the Embassy's argot when Ian and company
400 had rather pointedly suggested to His Excelancy that such matters were rather
401 beneath the dignity of his Honorable and Esteemed position.
402     That was when the erstwhile ambassadore from Lananara had taken to mutter-
403 ing to himself almost constantly and had become something of an obnoxios pain
404  to coworkers and underlings alike.  An unfortunate development only resolved
405  when His Excelance had finaly heeded his staff's advice and taken a long and
406 much needed vacation.  He's probably there right now, pickniking in the woods,
407 living it up with some wood nymph.
408     ARGH!  Wish I was there and His Excelance had a feather ...  Car'l was 
409 thinking.  Some people just have it made.
410     (note: if anyones interested what the 'good ambasador is ACTUALY doing;
411 check out alternate world at 777-xxxx)
412     Agent Sean was rudely returned to reality by the grating voice, sounding
413 not entirely unlike the old and infrequently oiled 'sliding' doors of his 
414 current 'quarters'.
415     'Come around here and let me introduce you' it was saying.

419 L'homme - Will contact later concerning matters.  Someone getting more
420 than just a triffle fed up with the the world?  Will seek the answers
421 after Jannet has left.  (In the big city for the day, or so...)

459 I sit and ponder,
460 what my thoughts mean,
461 no longer does my mind wander,
462 it'S thinking on one thing,
463 I wonder wxy,
464 we're the way we are,
465 are there other's like us?
466 On a distant star?
467 But my thoughts mean nothing,
468  of you,
469 they are mine alone,
470 With them, to do what I do.
471 I quietly think,
472 why I say all this,
473 it isn't important,
474 you could all miss,
475 what I'm saying, and not even care,
476 Am I talking this way?

478 A tale to be told,
479 oh yes it'S true,
480 a tale for me, a tale for you,
481 any story you might wish,
482 any tale that you might dream,
483 any adventure, romance, or like,
484 A dinner for the mind,
485 _h it'S quite a dish,
486 for your imagination.
487 Yes I am a minstrel,
488 and this is what I do,
489 I tell tales,
490 a tale for me, a tale for you.
491 A story for the young,
492 a story for the old,
493 A story for the mind,
494 A journey for the soul,
495 Oh yes I am the minstrel,

503 There will always be a special place in my heart for Cornvallis -- don't
504 be too hard on it!  There are quite a few very inteeligent people down
505 there -- even one who is going to start up a BBS for use over the Hamm
506 radio system!  I must say, however, that I didn't go to OSU, so my opinion
507 may be biased in the other direction.
508 Since it is Solstice Day (calloo, callay!), I thought I would regale you
509 with a short Parkeresque....
510                Summer Solstice
511 The sun is out, it's getting warm,
512 Bikinis spring from varied forms.
513 Turning heads and stares abound
514 (Some could lose, say, 30 pounds).
515 Striking most conspicuous poses,
516 Speading zinc on reddened noses.
517 A scrap of cloth on something tall,
518 (Some are wearing naught at all).
519 Slowly turn to expose that spot,
520 Where a careless sunbeam shouldn't ought.
521 From golden glow to reddened fury,
522 (Someone in too much a hurry!)
523 Always remember, when it's hot:
524 That summer clothes, and some are not.

527 Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are dead! And Rosewood and Taggart suddenly
528 make a whole lot more sense to these weary eyes of mine. The dynamic
529 duo of the silver screen make a reapperance later this summer in the
530 smash hit that is all the rage on the continent (that's Europe you
531 dopes) this season. Rosewood and Taggart II, what a catchy title.
532 "My name is gragaro. I am a fighter from the Soviet Union. I have fought
533 all my life and I never lose"
534 Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are indeed dead. Tis true Tis true.

537 Hummm, R & G are Dead was a STRANGE play, about as strange as the above
538 entry.  Perhaps I show my ignorance?  Is there a deep, hidden meaning in all
539 of that gibberish?
540 Oh, well.  Too bad there's not a PorSFiS this Sat.  I have to go to Portland,
541 anyway...
542 Piper: Two departures so close together is saddens me.  At least, in the
543 case of yours, we can look forward to your return.  May it be soon!

558 Dog Patrol: Wild dogs on ALT WORLD you say?  Last time MY four legged fds
559 were THERE (that I can recal) was a very long time ago indeed!  There aOO's
560 who are someone else's, mutualy admired and respected by Themnax and Elxtia
561 who are remarkably human in appearance (though they can count hexidecimaln
562 thair fingers) and in no way of 'dog-like appearance.  and there is p
563 who is, well, pretty much what person wants to be, appearance wise, and gs
564 around pretty well but usualy doesn't participate too much.  For good rean.
565 As to 'canine feaver' on tanis, well if we whats doin didn't like it it'de
566 up to someone else to do elsewise!
567 Esiest thing in the world (this or almost any other) is to 'bitch' and mo,
568 You got a better idea, go for it, were not THAT hard to ammuse.  I feel tt
569 we are created in the 'immage' of a Creator who bloody well intended thate
570 make the most of whatever potential we might have in that direction
571 lies happiness.  ELSEWARE madness.
572 Isis: (smile) thanx +
573 Patti: any way we can help?

578 TO THE DOCTOR: THERE ARE SEVERAL BOARDS DOWN IN EUGENIE. I HAD THE NUMBERS A WHILE
579 BACK BUT SINCE I WAS ONLY CALLING CORN VALLY  BOARDS THEY DISSAPPEARED. YOUR BEST
580 BET IS TO CALL 2 BOARDS IN CORVALLIS AND SPEND ABOUT 15 MINUTES GOING THROUGH THE
581 BBS LISTS IN THEM TO FIND EUGENE NUMBERS. (UNFORTUNATELY AT LONG DISTANCE RATES) 
582 FIRST, CALL CORVALLIS MICROTEXT, AT 754-xxxx AND LOOK IN THE COMMUNITY SERVICE
583 SECTION. THIS IS A NON PASSWORD SYSTEM AND SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE
584 USUAL FUN AND GAMES TO USE THE BOARD. THIS SECTION WILL HAVE CORVALLIS BOARDS AN
585 AND SOME EUGENE BOARDS. SECOND, CALL THE BEAVER BOARD(YES, I REALIZE IT IS A 
586 CORNY NAME) AND APPLY FOR A PASSWORD. 
587 THEN, CALL BACK IN A FEW DAYS AND LOOK IN THE OTHER BOARD SECTION. THIS IS A
588 FIDO BOARD, AND THE SOFTWARE IS FIRST CLASS(BESTED ONLY BY BACKWATER) I WILL TRY 
589 TO DIG UP THOSE NUMBERS THOUGH.(BEAVER BOARD IS 754-xxxx)

    I was wondering down a lazy road, and playing a small game with myself.  In
619 the spots that the sun filtered down through the leaves overhead, I would jump
620 over them, and try to reach the shadowed spots.  Then there was no more room.
