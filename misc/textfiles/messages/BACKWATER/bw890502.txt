107 BOYCOTT OF EXXON DEMANDED:-5/3/89
108     Connecticut state Sen. Mike Meotti and 50 legislators and 
109 environmentalists Tuesday called for a one-day boycott of Exxon, which unloads 
110 oil at the New Haven harbor. Similar protests in other states bashed Exxon for 
111 its handling of the March Valdez oil spill in Alaska.
112     Mobilization of people, material and equipment in Alaska to meet the 
113 schedule set in Exxon's cleanup plan for 305 miles of shoreline in Prince 
114 William Sound is nearing its peak, W.D. Stevens, president of Exxon Co., 
115 U.S.A., said. Speaking at the Offshore Technology Conference, Stevens said the 
116 company's "firm intent is to complete the cleanup by the mid-September 
117 deadline."
118     Protesters and Exxon officials agree it's too early to assess the long-
119 term impact of boycott of the company. But resentment against Exxon over its 
120 handling of the Valdez oil spill is mounting. Consumers have returned 10,000 
121 credit cards to Exxon in protest, though the company says that's only about 1 
122 percent of 7 million cards it has issued.
123     Exxon says a boycott of its products won't hurt the company, but 
124 independent dealers will suffer. The boycott is in response to the company's 
125 handling of the Valdez oil spill. "In this instance, a boycott of us in the 
126 marketplace would most affect a very large number of dealers and independent 
127 businessmen," Exxon USA President William Stevens said Tuesday in Houston.
128     Exxon says it's ridiculous to connect higher gas prices with the Alaska 
129 oil spill. Exxon: Number of factors contributed to the high prices, including 
130 higher demand for gasoline during spring and summer when families 
131 traditionally take vacations. But Sens. Jim Exon and Bob Kerrey, both Nebraska 
132 Democrats, asked Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to investigate potential 
133 price gouging.
134                                                                             
135 CRUDE OIL PRICE DROPS:-5/3/89
136     Crude oil prices fell 86 cents to close below the $20 mark Tuesday on news 
137 that Saudi Arabia pushed up its output last month, taking advantage of a 
138 booming market. West Texas intermediate crude, the U.S benchmark grade, ended 
139 at $19.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest closing 
140 price in a month. Crude oil is more than $2 a barrel higher than in January.
141 OIL PRICES SLIDE IN NEW YORK:-5/3/89
142     A report that Saudi Arabia is exceeding its OPEC quota for oil production 
143 sent the price of oil sliding 86 cents on the New York Mecantile Exchange. 
144 West Texas intermediate crude, the benchmark grade in the United States, 
145 closed at $19.80 a barrel. The report by Reuters has Saudi Arabia pumping 5.8 
146 million barrels a day. It's quota: 4.5 million barrels. Saudi Arabia denied 
147 the report.
148                                                                 
149 Any bets as to whether gasoline prices will be as quick to fall with falling 
150 crude prices as they were quick to rise???   If so, I have some shoreline in
151 Alaska you might be interested in purchasing....

235 Well, I'm tired of waiting for people to post. Heres a story I wrote a couple
236 of years ago. 
237                  	   Faith
238                         By Mike Miller
239      Father Garlin and Brother Parvis sat in the central most
240 chamber of the temple of Brian, and starred moodily at the images
241 that adorned the walls. This room was the private sanctum of the
242 Piests of Algor, old God of the land of Botonomy.
243      The Message had only hours before and until now
244 nobody had spoken of it. But Brother Parvis with the
245 impulsiveness of youth chose to break the silence.
246      "I wonder what Brian would have thought of this." he said
247 with an air of reverence.
248      "Brian lived in the time of the true Kings, he would be
249 disappointed by their passing if for nothing else." Father Garlin
250 replied.
251      "Yes Father but they passed years ago, three hundred and
252 sixty two years ago tomorrow, what does this have to do with our
253 problems now?"
254     "Parvis, sometimes I wonder how you made it past the most
255 basic levels of the faith. Since the coming  of the Governor 
256 Generals the power of our Church has been failing, They
257 have always seen us as a threat.." Father Garlin sighed deeply. 
258 "I have lived many years, but I never thought I'd live to see 
259 this day."
260      "Indeed, they have committed a grave blaspheme at the
261 cpitol." brother Parvis agreed.
262      Father Garlin nodded "I Should have known when the Governor
263 General started to push forward the belief in this new god Tor
264 that we would soon be threatened, But I had hoped that the people
265 would not be fooled."
266      Brother Parvis nodded "Even as you say it is so, When I left
267 the City to come here three years ago there was still much faith
268 in the great Algor, Sacred be his name. But now all I hear of are
269 Evils and depravitys, that Scroll is probably the greatest of
270 them all!"
271      "No" Father Garlin said gesturing at the land that lay
272 around them just beyond the walls of the Temple. "The greatest
273 atrocity they have committed is against the people."
274      "how can you say that when they would shut the church and
275 send us all back to the Capitol to be the lackey to that atrocity
276 of nature that sits now in the highest seat of our church!"
277 Brother Parvis yelled.
278      "Cool you temper boy, for that is what you show yourself to
279 be. The fitness of the Arch Decon is not for us to question, And
280 you miss the point besides, The Church exists not only to serve
281 Algor, but also to serve people. Without our protection and
282 the protection of others like us throughout the countryside The
283 governor General long ago would have made their lives unbearable.
284 Algor is a God, he needs not our services to survive, these
285 people do!"
286      "Perhaps you are right, but I know that if someone true to
287 Algor were the Arch Decon this closing of all our churches would
288 not have taken place. That man is possessed by the governor
289 General I think at times. The people of the citys are lost I
290 fear, but faith is still strong in the country. do we really have
291 to return to the Capitol?"
292      "If we do not they will send Soldiers out to bring us
293 back. I only wish there was something I could do."
294      "Perhaps there is Father, most say that when Bartholamue died 
295 you should have been elevated, instead you were demoted and sent 
296 out here" Brother Parvis said leaning forward expectantly in his 
297 seat.
298      Father Garlin closed his eyes and grimaced in deep thought. 
299 Finely he looked up and spoke. "I fear there is nothing I can do. 
300 leave me now and go relieve Brother Steal. It is bad enough that 
301 there are only three of us to run this place, We can at least give 
302 him time to rest and contemplate what has happened. wake me an hour 
303 before dawn, tomorrow is an important day."
304      "Ay father, and it would be great indeed if one of the true
305 blood were to return."
306      "I fear that tomorrow will be no different from all the days
307 that preceded it. Good night brother Parvis"
308      "Good night Father Garlin."
309                                II
310      Broderic Garlin (for that is how he thought of himself.)
311 opened the plain wooden door that lead to his room. It was by no 
312 means the largest in the temple but it was the one he claimed as 
313 his own.
314      The furnishings were plain and the personal items few. He
315 had never had a need for anything beyond the most basic
316 necessities. And so the room reflected the man.
317      The deep sense of regret he felt was  not for himself
318 bt instead for the people he had tried to serve for so many
319 years. The Governor General was depraved. Far worse then any of
320 those who had ruled before him, few of which had been even
321 tolerable.
322      As he prayed with half his mind the other half began to
323 wander. This was nothing new, but the thoughts that began to form
324 there were. As he continued his nightly absolutions the
325 beginnings of an idea formed. So disturbing was it that he totally 
326 forgot his place in the litany He had recited every night for the 
327 last 30 years and recoiled in shock.
328      "no." he thought "I can not do this thing, it would be wrong
329 to lie to those who have trusted me." and yet the thought would
330 not go away, it nibbled on the edges of his mind incessantly.
331 finely he could take it no more and was forced to stand and pace
332 the room. "Algor forgive me!" he mumbled continually. because It was
333 in his mind that there was a way in which he could save the
334 church and all that it stood for. but to do so would be to
335 violate many of his most basic beliefs.
336      Again he fell to the ground and prostrated himself praying
337 that some other method would present itself, or that these 
338 thoughts would disappear from his mind. But none had when at last 
339 he fell asleep there on the hard stone floor.
340      He awoke to a knock on the door, and to the reality of his 
341 aged flesh. "yes" he managed as he lifted himself slowly and painfully 
342 from the floor.
343      "Father Garlin it's me, Brother Steal. You asked to be
344 awoken an hour before dawn, and the time is upon us."
345      "Thank you, I'll be out in a moment Brother Steal."
346      "As you say Father."
347      Changing his robe Father Garlins mind returned to the
348 termoil that had engulfed it before.
349      "Are you well Father." Brother Steel asked as Father Garlin
350 moved from his room.
351      "Sorry Brother Steel I'm afraid my mind is wandering."
352      "The crowd is the best I've seen in the years I've been
353 here, I think perhaps the news has gotten out."
354      "Ah yes" he mumbled.
355      Brother steal shrugged and gave up on further conversation.
356      Standing in the doorway that led out to the alter he would stand
357 at, Father Garlin saw the first light of dawn break over the mountains.
358 The wind blew chill as he walked out into the early morning
359 predawn glow. Steeping up to the alter he looked out upon the many faces
360 that looked up expectantly at him. they were mostly farmers with
361 a sparse scattering of the towns small merchant class. for many
362 it was the biggest day of the year. He had performed this ceremony 
363 more times then he could remember, before he had seen looks of expectation 
364 on the faces of those who had stood before him. Now he could see only 
365 questions.
366      It was at this point that he made his decision.
367      "I know that you have come here expecting the ceremony of
368 the true Kings. It is indeed the day and the time but I have
369 something else to tell you of."
370      He stopped and prayed to Algor that what he was about to do 
371 was right.
372      "I have great news for you this morning. First I must tell
373 you that this night was perhaps the most difficult of my life. I
374 hd found out only yesterday afternoon that the Arch Decon would
375 be recalling those of us in the field So that he can
376 centralize our operations and serve the people better. Now I Know
377 in my heart that this is wrong, and I thought long 
378 this problem." Here he took a deep breath. "And in the time of my
379 deepest despair Saint Brian appeared to me and gave me
380 this message. He said in a voice that echoed inside my head, 
381      "Know that a great evil has fallen upon the land, Know also 
382 that the time is close when the true King will return. Only because 
383 of the faith of the true believers has this come to pass. The evil
384 in the Cities cannot be allowed to spread. call on all that you
385 know and spread this message. My lord Algor has said that his
386 servants shall stay in the countryside and work with the good
387 people here. he sends also this message to those who live in the
388 city and those who rule them. 'Continue not down the path you have
389 followed these many years or my wrath will be vast.' "
390        "Then Brian told me to give you this message and tell you
391 that we will not be leaving. If the Govenor General sends his
392 soldiers to take myself or anyone else back to the Capitol they
393 are to be stopped. You are the instruments of Algors wrath."
394      Having said this he looked over the crowd noticing
395 their shocked expresions. The sun came up over the mountains to
396 the east. suddenly the cold wind turned warm.
397  
398 Just thought I'd fill some lines.

428 HE APPLIED FOR A COLD FUSION PATENT BACK IN 1927
429  
430 Nothing is new under the sun. The much noticed experiment with cold
431 fusion at the university of Utah is very similar to experiments done
432 in Sweden back in 1927 - more than 60 years ago.

439  
440 By Bertil Berggren
441 ------------------
442  
443 He has been called one of the greatest scientists of Swedish industry,
444 John Tandberg (born in Norway 1896), professor at Lund university,
445 chemist and physicist. During almost 40 years, 1925 - 1962 he worked
446 at the Electrolux laboratories in Stockholm, the last years as
447 scientific director and manager.  [Electrolux is a large
448 electrotechnical Swedish company, these days multinational. It is most
449 well known (in Sweden at least) as a manufacturer of larger household
450 appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines.]
451  
452 Today he is almost forgotten, you have to leaf through modern Swedish
453 encyclopediae for a long time before finding his name. Still, he was a
454 pioneer, one of the first in the world to make serious attempts to
455 solve the riddle of nuclear fusion. Perhaps he succeeded as well,
456 without himself or the rest of the world quite realising it. These
457 days he is of more interest than ever.
458  
459 The experiment in Utah, where the american Stanley Pons and the
460 englishman Martin Fleishmann claim to have produced nuclear fusion at
461 room temperature in a test tube [sic!], was done under conditions that
462 were very similar to certain experiments Tandberg did at the
463 Electrolux laboratories at Grev [Count] Ture street in central
464 Stockholm in the late 1920's and early 1930's.
465  
466 In his laboratory he became the first Swede who tried to find both a
467 theoretical and practical solution to exploit nuclear energy by
468 particle fusion, the fusing of atomic nuclei.
469  
470 In the book "Our alchemist in Tomegraend [Tome alley]", a biography of
471 John Tandbergs life and work, the early work of Tandberg on fusion
472 research is portrayed. The narrator is Torsten Wilner, a collaborator
473 in Tandberg's group for several years.
474  
475 During the 1920's forceful efforts were made in Germany to produce
476 large quantities of helium for airships. [After world war I, Germany
477 was not permitted to build airplanes]. There was unrest in the world
478 and the only large producer, the U.S., was reluctant to export helium,
479 made from natural gas, to Germany.
480  
481 At the university of Berlin, the chemists Fritz Paneth and Kurt Peters
482 sought other ways to produce helium, among other by catalysis of
483 hydrogen. The basic thought was to investigate "whether hydrogen
484 without the supply of energy could be partially transformed to helium
485 in the presence of a cathalyst, primarily palladium".
486  
487 The hypothesis of Prout - the old thought that hydrogen could be the
488 "primordial substance" from which all other elements where constructed
489 - had been given renewed actuality by the dawning research on
490 radioactivity.
491  
492 After their studies of hydrogen absorption the the metal palladium
493 (one volume of palladium will absorb 850 volumes of hydrogen), Paneth
494 and Peters were of the opinion that there should be a possibility for
495 spontaneous reactions between the hydrogen nuclei that were contained,
496 close to each other, within the palladium atom lattice. They reasoned
497 that perhaps some kind of "nuclear cathalysis" could be expected with
498 helium as a result.
499  
500 By diffusing hydrogen through a red-hot palladium capillary, the two
501 Berlin chemists claimed to have produced helium. The amount was small
502 and hardly measurable. It did not suffice to fill airships.
503  
504 The results of Paneth and Peters soon reached Sweden and John Tandberg,
505 who was interested in the relation of hydrogen to metals. He promptly
506 began thinking about how an improved helium yield could be obtained in
507 the process of Paneth and Peters. Tandberg's idea was to increase the
508 concentration of hydrogen atoms in the cathalyst using electrolysis.
509 He expected the hydrogen atom density within the palladium to be
510 greater than in liquid helium.
511  
512 By using high pressure, about 1000 atmospheres, and starting the
513 electolysis process at a low temperature, Tandberg believed that the
514 process should be even more effective.
515  
516 The result was an application for a Swedish patent, "A way to produce
517 helium", that was filed on february 17, 1927. The patent application
518 also comprised a method "characterized in that the reaction vessel is
519 put into thermal contact with a device that converts the produced heat
520 into a technically useful form (mechanical work, electrical energy,
521 cooling or light)". Recieved but not understood, was the reply from
522 the patent office.
523  
524 The application was rejected on november 17 the same year with the
525 reason that "the description is not complete enough that by its use an
526 expert is likely to be able to practise the invention" [Isn't this a
527 great way of putting it...?]. But John Tandberg was not a man who let
528 himself be put down by an unappreciative surrounding.
529  
530 With the headline "A nuclear blast in 1932" (20 years before the
531 detonation of the first american hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean in
532 1952), Torsten Wilner relates in his book:
533  
534 "The discovery by Urey in 1932 of heavy hydrogen, deuterium, meant
535 greater possibilities for research in nuclear physics. Nuclei of heavy
536 hydrogen, deutrons, have a greater ability to achieve nuclear
537 reactions than the light nuclei, protons, do.
538  
539 John was quick to take advantage of this. At a rather early stage, he
540 managed to obtain heavy water, containing deuterium instead of
541 ordinary hydrogen.
542  
543 One day after work, John told me that he intended to do an interesting
544 experiment in the evening. He showed me a small wire of the metal
545 palladium.  By electrolysis of heavy water, using this wire as
546 cathode, he had saturated it with deuterium in the same way he had
547 previously done with ordinary hydrogen (1927). Consequently, it could
548 be expected to contain very densly packed deuterium nuclei.
549  
550 He was now going to blast the wire by letting a condensor battery,
551 charged with a high voltage, discharge through it. This would mean a
552 sudden vaporization during a violent increase of pressure and
553 temperature.
554  
555 The densly packed deutrons should get a high energy and there should
556 be good conditions for violent collisions with nuclear reaction and
557 fusion as a result. These reactions involve some loss of mass by the
558 nuclei, so one could expect energy generation according to Einstein's
559 theory.
560  
561 That sounded exciting, so I asked John how large the energy generation
562 could be if all of the deuterium reacted. He calculated for a while,
563 and replied:
564 - About a million kilogramcalories [About 4.2*10^9 Joules].
565 - But that is equivalent to a thousand kilogrammes of dynamite! I exclaimed.
566 - You are right about that, John replied, but added:
567 - I think you should go home now. If anything particular happens you
568 can tell people afterwards what it was.
569  
570 I went home, and when I returned the next day, everything was as
571 before. John performed experiments repeatedly, but no disaster struck.
572 Later the experiments become routine. I was present myself, together
573 with John, at several occations, and certainly the experiments caused
574 deafening bangs.
575  
576 The electric discharges sounded like powerful shots, but some nuclear
577 physical effect - hard radiation or radioactive residues - could not
578 be detected with the equipment John possessed at the time."
579  
580 Torsten Wilner concludes his impressions of John Tandberg:
581  
582 "In later years I have tried to reconstruct John's calculations. I
583 also had opportunity to discuss the matter with the plasma and fusion
584 researcher, professor Bo Lehnert. He pointed out the similarity
585 between Johns experiments and later experiments that really led to
586 fusion reactions. At the same time, he demonstrated the large energy
587 losses that must be taken into account in experiments of Tandberg's
588 kind.
589  
590 If John had succeeded in demonstrating a certain - even if very slight
591 - effect it would have been an extraordinary remarkable discovery for
592 its time."
593  
594 So far Torsten Wilner in the book "Our alchemist in Tomegraend".
595  
596 John Tandberg died in Lund 1968. The scientific world is now waiting
597 with excitement for the scientific paper about the Utah fusion
598 experiment that is said to be due for publication in the magazine
599 Nature in May.
600  
601 Perhaps it turns out to be "only" a repetition of John Tandberg's
602 experiment of more than 60 years ago.

622 NORTH CONVICTED ON 3 COUNTS:-5/5/89
623     Oliver North was convicted Thursday on three of 12 charges in the Iran-
624 Contra trial: obstructing Congress by falsifying a list of events in 1986; 
625 taking National Security Council documents; taking an illegal gift - a $13,800 
626 home security system, purchased with money from funds diverted from arms sales 
627 to Iran. The maximum penalty for all counts is ten years in jail and $750,000 
628 in fines.
629  POLL - PARDON NORTH:
630     President Bush should pardon convicted Iran-Contra scandal figure Oliver 
631 North, say a majority polled by USA TODAY Thursday. Findings: 72 percent say 
632 North was a Reagan administration "fall guy"; 33 percent say North is a hero; 
633 54 percent agree North was a "willing participant"; 48 percent say North 
634 should spend no time in prison.
635  NORTH - I WON'T GIVE UP:
636     Retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North declared Thursday that he hasn't 
637 surrendered after a jury convicted him on three of 12 counts in the Iran-
638 Contra scandal. "As a Marine I was taught to fight and fight hard for as long 
639 as it takes to prevail," North said at a news conference, his wife Betsy at 
640 his side. "We will be fully vindicated."
641  IRAN-CONTRA QUESTIONS IRK BUSH:
642     President Bush hotly rejected questions about his activities in the Iran-
643 contra scandal as Congress steps up pressure for more answers from the White 
644 House. Bush says he takes it personally when he is pelted with questions about 
645 whether he offered to give Honduras U.S. aid in exchange for helping the 
646 Nicaraguan Contras when Congress banned direct assistance.
647  TODAY'S DEBATE - OLIVER NORTH AND IRAN-CONTRA
648  USA TODAY'S OPINION:
649     To prosecutor John Keker, Oliver North was a cross between Adolf Hitler 
650 and Joe Isuzu. To defense attorney Brendan Sullivan, he was a loyal and 
651 dedicated Marine. A jury decided Thursday that he was a bit of each. That's 
652 justice.
653  OTHER VIEWS:
654     JESSE HILL FORD, novelist and screen writer: The man who would have freed 
655 the hostages has been taken hostage, pilloried by the country he served so 
656 steadfastly. And in this foul process our jury system has been prostituted, 
657 judicial honor defiled, and the will of the people denied. But Oliver North's 
658 leadership qualities ensure he will rise above this mess and serve his country 
659 again.
660     GEORGE THOMPSON, a former U.S. foreign service officer: The jurors had a 
661 terrible, thankless task. They undoubtedly knew they had been asked to convict 
662 Ollie as nothing more than a self-styled pawn in a game of chess. Exit the 
663 jurors, knowing the real criminals are still out there. If only we could try 
664 them all.
665     BRENDAN SULLIVAN, North's attorney, to jury: "What's the difference 
666 between what Ollie North did and the president did? The president is happily 
667 retired in California. Oliver North has spent 2 1/2 years in a Washington 
668 courtroom fighting for his reputation."
669     JOHN KEKER, North's prosecutor, to jury: "Don't be misled by the emotional 
670 content of this `fall guy' term...The fall guy is guilty. The winner is 
671 guilty. The people who pay him are guilty. They are all guilty."
672     WALNUT CREEK, CALIF., John Claibourne, 44, television engineer: I'm not so 
673 sure that Oliver North should have gone to trial because I think they tried 
674 the wrong guy. He was the fall guy. Others are guilty, but we'll never be able 
675 to touch them.
676     MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., Barbara Kline, 54, homemaker: Oliver North should have 
677 been punished. It's one thing to be a military man and another to be a 
678 demagogue.
679

682 APn  05/03 1989 By PAUL JENKINS Associated Press Writer
683    VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) -- Thousands of dead birds, snared in a giant glob of
684 sticky oil, line a beach 300 miles southwest of Valdez, victims of the spreadin
685 crude that has devastated Alaska's coast for weeks.
686    While enviromentalists, government and Exxon officials trade barbs over
687 blame, the oil drifts inexorably, fouling the shoreline and leaving dead, dying
688 or dirtied birds, fish, otters, seals and sea lions. Even Alaska's lumbering,
689 powerful brown bears have been seen prowling on oil-caked beaches.
690    The oil is selective: It leap-frogs large stretches of coast, then hits
691 others with contamination ranging from a light film to ankle-deep goo.
692    "We landed along a wide tidal basin, about six miles of beach," said Ray
693 Bane, superintendent of Katmai National Park. "We found oil debris in large
694 quantities throughout the tidal zone. We saw 2,000 to 3,000 dead birds. ... You
695 can't really tell what they are. They're one big blob of oil."
696    Since March 24, when the tanker Exxon Valdez smashed into Bligh Reef in
697 Prince William Sound and leaked 10.1 million gallons of crude through its
698 shattered hull, the reports of destroyed wildlife have multiplied steadily.
699    The spyll has reached Chignik, 525 miles southwest of Valdez, and residents
700 there are fearful the oil may interfere with their salmon season, which begins
701 next week.
702    "What we found, say in every 100-foot distance, was four to eight dead murre
7 3 on the average," Bane said of the sea birds. "We also saw fresh bear tracks
704 going back into the impacted areas. There was evidence of foxes and other
705 scavengers. We observed one bear -- a sow and three yearlings -- that was in th
706 contaminqted0area, feeding on dead birds. ... We saw eagles carrying oil-covere
707 birds. We saw one eagle so coated in oil that it couldn't fly."
708    One state scientist said wind-whipped oil "mousse" was pounded into a beach
709 by wave action and buried q yard below the surface. Another reported seeing
710 otters surrounded by floating oil.
711    Late Monday, Exxon offered a revised plan to clean up 364 miles of tainted
712 coastline by September, but environmentalists and Coast Guard Adm. Paul Yost,
713 the federal government's top official monitoring the spill, immediately
714 criticized it as inadequate.
715    Dennis Kelso, Alaska's commissioner of environmental conservation, said the
716 proposal was "a few pages of wishful thinking ... (that) makes it appear as
717 though cleaning those areas is little more than a Sunday stroll on the beach."
718    Yost, who must approve the plan before it can go into effect, called Exxon's
719 strategy "very thin." Yost briefly toured part of the spill abua Tuesday,
720 visiting the USS Juneau, the Coast Gaurd's command ship for the cleanup.
721    Today, Yost was scheduled to take U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel
722 Skinner on an inspection of the spill zone. At a speech Tuesday in Washington,
723 D.S., Skinner called the spill "the most significant environmental disaster thi
724 nation has ever faced."
725    On Thursday, he meets with Vice President Dan Quayle, who is expected in
726 Alaska after a 12-day tour of the Pacific.
727    Exxon a|co faced a day of boycott Tuesday, as groups around the country urge
728 consumers to stop buying Exxon products. Consumer activist Ralph Nader said in
729 Washington that Exxon "should not be allowed to forget" the spill and that a
730 boycott would send the oil giant a message.
731    J. Edward Surette Jr., executive director of the Bay State Gasoline Retailer
732 Association in Billerica, Mass., said it was too early to assess the boycott's
733 impact.
734    Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Johnson said !0,000 of its 7 million credit cards
735 have been cut up and returned since the spill.
736    In Anchorage, 400 chanting and sign-waving protesters rallied in front of
737 Exxon's Alaska headquarters, calling for a boycott.
738    The Exxon Valdez is undergoing preliminary repairs in Prince William Sound

743    ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Vice President Dan Quayle toured sludge-fouled
744 beaches on his return from a 12-day Pacific tour, and said today Exxon must do
745 more to clean up the devastation wrought by the nation's largest oil spill.
746    "It's going to be an enormous effort," Quayle said Thursday as he looked at 
747 beach on hard-hit Smith Island, an important haulout area for seals. Workers
748 have been |aboring for days to wash the beach clean.
749    Then at a news conference early today, Quayle said it appears Exxon believes
750 its cleanup plan is adequate, "But I believe Exxon's going to have to do more
751 than they think they're going to have to do," he said.
752    Quayle, accompanied by his wife, Marilyn, and joined by Coast Guard
753 Commandant Paul A. Yost Jr. and federal Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
754 ended his Pacific trip Thursday with a six-hour, wind- and rain-swept tour0of
'55 the spill zone.
756    The vice president's jet arrived from Japan at the fishing town of Cordova,
757 about 50 miles from the site of the March 24 spill, which was caused when the
758 tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into a charted reef outside ship`ing lanes and
759 ripped open spilling 11.2 million gallons of oil.                 
760

796 This was the data that represented humanity, updated every nanosecond
797 by countless millions of users.  For Sem, THIS was reality.
798         The myriad controls beneath the hands of Sem's matrix-analogue
799 glittered in the false light of the matrix.  He geared himself up for
800 the run.  His drug worked ids mawic on him, and he felt POWER rush
801 through his body.  There would be no finesse to this one- just a
802 typical snatch-and-run.  Only no one had ever tried it on the Turings
803 before and lived.

807 the pseudo-display.  Now or never.  Sem hit COMMIT.
808         DiamondCutter shot forward, closing the distance even0befobe
809 the ICE systems reacted.
810         Tendrils of dead black ICE whipped forward instantly, blindly
811 seeking the intruder.  Their lightest touch would invoke lethal
812 biofeedback programs, designed to snuff out nosy console jockeys.
813 DiamondCutter moved evasively, firing missle-analogues containing
814 a particularly effective snafu program.  Its aim was deadly.  As each
815 missle-program found its target, more of the Turing defense system
816 collapsed under massive system failubus. 0In less than an instant,

833 an AI for their ICE.

835         Sem was running out of time.  Once all the threads were down,

837 programs.  "Find it, damn you, find--"

879    Rick Nelson, who died in a New Year's Eve plane crash near De Kalb, Texas,
880 jined a list of musicians including big band leader Glenn Miller, country
881 singer Patsy Cline, and rock greats Otis Redding and Buddy Holly -- all of whom
882 met early deaths in air accidents.
883    ^elson, 45, achieved rock 'n' roll stardom in the late 1950s and early '60s
884 with hits like "I'm Wakin,"' and "ravelin' Man." He was featured, along with th
885 rest of his family, on the long-running TV series, "The Adventures of Ozzie and
886 Hriet." He often sang his hit songs on national TV, which undoubtedly boosted
887 his rock stardom.
888    His career after the "Ozzie and Harriet" years never equaled his earlier
889 fame, but he was in a number of movies and hd several moderately successful0son
890 hits.
891    Plane crashes have cut short the lives of at least eight other famous
892 musicians.
893    Still shrouded in mystery is the death of big band leader Glenn Miller. On
894 Dec. 15, 1944, Miller's plane was flying over the English Channel en route from
895 Bedford, England to Paris where he was to give a show. The plane never arrived.
896 Two members of the British Royal Air Force now say the musician's plane might
897 have been hit by bombs jettisoned over the English Channel by RAF bombers.
898    These other musicians also met air deaths:
899    Feb. 3, 1959: A plane carrying singers J.P (The Big Bopper) Richardson, Budd
900 Holly and Richie Valens crashed near Mason City, Iowa en route to a show in
901 Fargo, N.D. The Big Bopper, whose big hit was "Chantilly Lace" in 1958, was 29.
902 Holly, whose hits included "Peggy Sue" and "Not Fade Away," was 22. And Richie
903 Valens, famous for songs like "La Bamba" and "Donna," was only 18.
904    March 5, 1963: Patsy Cline, whocu country hits included "Crazy" and "She's
905 Got You," died in a plane crash near Camden, Tenn., at age 31. Killed with her
906 were Grand Ole Opry stars Cowboy Copas and Hawkshaw Hawkins and pilot Randy
907 Hughes, Miss Cline's manager. Her life was dramatized in the recent movie,
908 "Sweet Dreams," starring Jessica Lange as Miss Cline.
909    July 31, 1964: Country music singer Jim Reeves, known for hits like "Welcome
910 to My World" and "He'll Have to Go," died at age 39 in a light plane crash0near
911 Nashville along with his manager, Dean Manuel, 30.
912   Dec. 10, 1967: Rhythm and blues artist Otis Redding died in a plane crash in
913 Wisconsin along with members of his band, the Bar-Kays. He was 26. His greatest
914 hit, "Sittin' on the Dock of The Bay," was released just three days before the
915 crash.
916    Sept. 20, 1973: Jim Croce put together a string of rock hits in the 1970s
917 before he died in an air crash near Natchitoches, La., at age 30.
918    Oct. 21, 1977: Singer Ron~ie Van Zant and some members of his Lynyrd Skynyrd
919 band, which carved a niche in the rock world with its image as hard-drinking,
920 hell-raising Southerners, were killed in a plane crash in McComb, Miss.

981 Awa 01/16 0552  TankerBan
9820   PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) -- Clallam County officials say they are considerin
983 a ban on tanker traffic in Port Angeles Harbor because of last month's oil spil
984 that fouled the county's beaches and killed more than 1,000 birds.
985    Commissioneb Dobothy Duncan said commissioners were weighing the costs and
986 benefits of allowing oil tankers to berth in Port Angeles on their way to
987 refineries in Washington's inland waters.
988    But Atlantic Richfield Co., owner of the tanker ARCO Anchorage0that spilled
989 the 189,000 gallons of Alaska crude oil in Port Angeles on Dec. 21, said it and
990 other tanker owners would challenge any move to keep tankers out of the harbor.
991    And Coast Guard Capt. John De Carteret said that even though the county coul
992 the ships from the harbor, the law could be challenged in
993 court and proved in violation of interstate commerce rules.
994    Cleanup of the spill is nearly complete. Arco is paying the more than $3
995 million in cleanup costs>
99&    The existing regulation banning tankers of more than 125,000 tons from Puget
997 Sound was established only because the state asked the Coast Guard to institute
998 the rule, De Carteret said.
999    Ms. Duncan was not available Wednesday evening to respond to De Carteret's
