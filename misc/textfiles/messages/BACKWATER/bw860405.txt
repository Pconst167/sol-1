63 YEAH!
64 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
65 But there are some instances in which I think it would be rather apppropos to
66 take that course of action.  Particularly those who feel the need to 
67 try and minister yto you, even if you wish not to be thus attended.  My 
68 grandparents verge on this.  I was practically scared into it the first time
69 by those two, and the second time was for reasons I am not proud of.  
70 However, I do not like to  have such things shoved in my face.  For example,
71 is anyone here fiamiliar with the tract "Signs of the Times"?  We get that 
72 every month despite the fact that we have never subscribed to said tract.
73 I asked my mother, who has many of the same views as I do, and she replied 
74 that they had received that since they first got married , nearly 20 years ago.
75 It is these people who need a good dose of reality, that they are not going 
76 to change anyone this way, just aggravate them in the extreme.
77 	Another thing which makes me angry is that they question my education.
78 I have chosen, after a few changes of mind, that I truly enjoy speaking other
79 languages than my own.  Last summer, for graduation, my parents enrolled me
80 in a homestay program, and I was able to spend a month in Germany.  I really
81 enjoyed the time I spent there, and decided, given the dchance, I would live
82 there permanently.....  masThis was received with "Are you really sure you want
83 to do that?" and "You don't really mean that.?".  Of course I meant it, 
84 otherwise I would not have said it.  Now they are questioning my learning 
85 of the Russian language.......      The best thing to do is ignore these
86 people.  I find it is very rude to try and minister to people, unless the 
87 person wants to be ministered to , and I don't.  When they force themselves
88 upon others, and make requests for donations, I feel that they have gone too
89 far.

102 I used to be really heavy into christianity.  Lately, though I've really re-
103 evaluated my opinions on the ruler of the universe.  I find that I'm becoming more
104 and more of an agnostic.....
105 Christianity is most of the time a lot of hype.  Mind you, it has been and will
106 continue to be a major influencing factor on today's society, and it does teach
107 some veeeerrrrrrryyyyy good principles of life.  However, I really don't need the 
108 demands it places on my time and money.

112     i never thought much of religion... a fine thing to have temples...
113 places for worship... perhaps a sacrifice to a pagan god... but the church
114 is different... it is a tithe booth for a modern day roman empire... as
115 far as i could tell the times i went...

116     religion does teach ethics... but it presents them as a judgement call
117 that might... if you are nasty enough... end in an inferno... it is more
118 of an enforcement agency than a teacher... that isn't the way ethics ought
119 to be presented...
120 
    perhaps we ought to start our own religion... nah...
121 
122 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
123   Emu -- (re: comment on last disk) agreed.  I fear that I sometimes tar very
124 sincere persons with the sins of supposed "CHRISTIANS".  Unfortunately, the
125 porportions seem to be quite high.
126   Zephr -- I don't recall who Goth is.  The last Goth I recall was a character
127 in Schmitzes' _Witches of Karres_ ....

132 too long of a lapse I would imagine...  And while I'm at alternates...
133 Piper:  Thank you for the note of explaination on the home system.  I'm some-
134         what pleased to know that I didn't hold a misconception over you-
135         know-who.  Life goes on.
136 L'homme:  I've been off the line for awhile.  Don't worry about the funds,
137         most anything along that subject I tend to take in stride.  And I am
138         in no major rush unless you are, although it would be nice to have at
139         my disposal some materials I might recognize.
140 Prometheus:  BW840404:  That's odd; forty cols and all caps...  Just kidding.
141 Guzmar: If you're going to add delays in your uploadings, this is absurd.
142         They're supposed to be fractions of seconds after each character, not

244 Heathen:  Yes, it's true that many people do try to push their religious ideas on you, but my point was that I cannot
245 accept too many things that doughnut says because I feel that he can't deal with anything rationally.  As for being
246 unreligious just because some people pressure you, I don't feel that that is a good reason.  Now if you just don't
247 believe, or care to, then that is your own decision.   However, not all religious groups go out and try to influence
248 people.  I think that (not you, nessisarally) many people have not seen what the majority of religions are like.  I
249 haven't.  I They are not all the same, and each one should be given a fair chance.
250 DK: I doubt that a personal relationship with God costs money.  And you don't have to meditate for hours a day to be
251 religious, either.  Religious beliefs, as I am talking about, have little to do with belonging to an organized religion.
252 As I said above, different religions are different, and if you feel monitary pressure, then perhaps you should just
253 have your own understanding of what you believe in.
254 
255 Keeper of Souls: How is that for being vague.  I can't even remember what you are trying to ask me.  I write more often
256 on here than once every week or so, as you seem to do (nothing wrong with that...), but I cdon't know what you are

279 can't teach or preach religious beliefs
280 in school.... Well, for that matter,
281 they shouldn't be able to tell us that
282 and I quote from Wierd Al In 3-D:

319   "God is the pinnacle.  The fountainhead of life.  Feel him reach out to you

343 Hello folks,
344      It's Tuesday morning, sitting about watching the teli and doing housework.
345 since we are on "spin" right now I thought I'd log in and see what was shakin
346 in bbs land.  The Nerd is down for major updating, the bucket doesn't answer
347 either.  But thank goodness a open line was available here on the BW.  I'm 
348 just not in the debating mood these days and the debate going on here is getting
349 kinda dirty so....
350       It's Hallway of life time:  that great writing show that lets you explore
351 past your terminal, understand craziness and have a good time in the process.
352 Ive been through a few doors with you and a few doors alone, here's one to share.
353       The door of generosity:
354   I took my escape and the door was waiting open for me, as I stepped thru a
355 short blonde haired man handed me a glass of wine and directed me towards the
356 patio.  A group of people were gathered and a barbeque was sizzling with 
357 steaks.  Music was playing softly and the sun was shinning. A perfect day
358 in the springtime, although I knew noone in the start of the afternoon I
359 soon was given names to go with faces and I enjoyed myself tremedously.
360 Not only were the hosts generous to me, but so were the the guests and the
361 weatherman.  I found myself singing and telling stories so I might make a
362 contibution as well.   as the day came to a close, I reluctly pulled out
363 my escape, a final thank-you and I was gone.
364 what comes around, goes around.

374 I WOULD JUST LIKE TO TALK ABOUT CHRISTIANITY<
375 To me it seems (even before I became Satanic) that
376 any religon that revolves around the belifes in GOD, is constantly
377 contridickting its self, in all ways possiable.
378 The main reson for that is becouse as I have said
379 before, their is inly a few TRUE christan`s left.
380 I can garentee any one there is not a real christian
381 amoung us or in that fact in Portland.
382 I admitt their are children of God, & priest of God.
383 But their conspet about things are tottaly
384 so mixed up its pitifull. (LOOK AT BARUIT)
385 I have never met a pries in my life face to face,
386 that didnt act like "HEELO HOW IS YOUR DAY"  etc....
387 Not coming right out & preching God`s word to me.
388 Thats kind of strange when i constantly were my Amulet.
389 He shoul be telling me things like you`ll Burn & stuff.
390 But thats O.K. too. Becouse I wont Burn as bad as thy will !!
391 Anyways, if any one thinks that thy know A TRUE
392 desindent of God who is alive Now, (NOT JESUS)
393 Id appreshiate to here his name, so he wouldnt be so holy
394 any more. (please no buddy say the Pope ha,ha,ha)
395 
396 INCLOSING;  I`d just like to say that if A person whishes

419 Keeper of Souls:  Explain how Christains are two-faced.  I see a lot of
420 accusations, but nothing at all to back them up.
421      One thing you did say was a Christian weakness was that the priest yoy
422 talked to did not try to convert you.  Di you already forget all the talk
423 about how religions are too pushy?!?  As far as Behruit, I don't think that
424 the entire problem was caused by all Christians in the world.  And the
425 
426 And I won't even begin to mention all the problems Satanists have caused..

462   As a teenager, I beleived in Christ very strongly; now I am not as
463   sure of myself or my beliefs, but is still strongly feel that anyone
464   has the right to believe what they will, as long as they keep that
465   belief PERSONAL.  (emphasis here!)  When I was fourteen I had an intense
466   religious (?) experience:  I spoke in toungues.  For a short time it
467   strengthened my faith, but after awhile, perhaps two or three years, I
468   began to ask the question:  was that experience an actual visitation of
469   God into my life, or was it a product of my own mind?  And I began to 
470   explore ... the occult, bio-feedback, drugs - anything or any idea that
471   had to do with the paranormal or extraordinary events.  Well, the drugs
472   almost messed up my colledge career and my health, but I survived and
473   my faith in god did not; what i learned was worth the risk:  everyone must
474   believe something (even if that belief is nilistic (yech, i hate that word))
475   Belief is a part of human nature; It is a means of coping with a world 
476   that passes all understanding, and as that need to belive is built-in, it
477   cannot be avoided, just as learning to speak cannot be avoided by healthy
478   babies.  It is too bad that many belief systems have been corrupted by
479   ancient power structures to the point that promulgation of that belief
480   system has become part of the system.  As a young man I realized the 
481   personal nature of Christianity, and that is how I was able to effect 
482   such a strong reaction as the gift of toungues - I held a deep personal 
483   faith that amplified the power of my own mind.  
484  				Enough babble for now, 
485  Keep the faith, whatever it is.

535   Boy, would I like to get all of you on Town Hall, or something like that, 
536 then maybe add a few sundry priests and satanists! WOW! more entertainment than
537 Dynasty! But for now, on this BBS.. could we PLEEEEASE talk about some other 
538 things? Isn't there more to this exciting and stimulating life than what comes 
539 after it? I mean, six hundred lines of
540 christian discourse is not my idea of fun reading.
541   There are many other hot topics that can be breached! How about Abortion, Aids
542 Homosexuality, Feminisim, Mozart, the spelling of Qhaddafi, Sex before marriage
543 Sex after Marriage, Imelda Marcos' shoes, American Naval movements in the
544 Meditterranian, Soviet/American relations, ( Don't get too hot on that.. I am
545 Russian but by no means communist), Nuclear weapons, Pollution, free love, 
546 Nature conservation, the list goes on and on.
547 no God, No Hell, and we are just ephemeral bubbles of nothingness that rise 
548 m primordial ooze. Saves lots of disk space as well as hot air!

579 few months. Any comments on what prices would be reasonable?
