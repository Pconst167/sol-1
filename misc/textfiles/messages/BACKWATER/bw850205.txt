22 If Backwater became a closed board like so many others, it would
23 loose it's personality.  All the spark of new writers and new
24 ideas would be gone, only stories for the people who wrote them
25 to read.  People who couldn't get on would grow to dislike BW and
26 when they did get on they would take it out on the people who were
27 here.  Oh well, there are two sides to this argument like every
28 other one.
29 Melisa: Please don't let things get you down.  Like Cistop Mikey
30 said, you are the model user!  Us low-lifes look up to you with
31 great respect.  You writing is fun and heart warming to read, please
32 don't stop.

34 hi there everyone
35 
36 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PaPa
37 So close, and I missed part of a disk.  Such is INN life.
38 HOOVER:  Very nice, I liked your story.  Your writting has improved
39 in this regeneration a lot.  [Big smile].  Keep up the great work.
40 tilean:  I am still trying to get a better map.  But this one should
41          do for now.  I need to talk to someone about it and make
42          sure it is right, but I think it is.
43          PS> I like your story to.  And I agree that this does sound
44              like the best of the spy stories.  A lot of work has
45              gone into it.  [not much knowing you, it just goes natural].
46 TWIT ABOVE:  Please read lines 3 thru 18 for instructions on using this
47              board before your entries.  You can also request HELP
48              when at command mode.   Thanks.
49 PIPER:  Good to hear about your (soon) return to the INN.  I've
50           heard alot about you and look forward to your return. 
51 Little SMURFS:  Be sure and look for your "PAPA SMURF FOR PRESIDENT"
52           buttons in your boxes of cold cereal.  And remember:
53                 "HAVE A SMURFY DAY"
54 ALL:  I will be out of town this PorSFiS so I will see you next time
55       around.  Have fun.
56 TO THE HITCHHIKER GROUP:  Hope you had fun.  I was expecting a little
57       more responce from the INN about our multi entry but then
58       everyone must have been a little drunk and took not much
59       notice of our unusual entry.

62      Adrian, Thank you very much. I hope we can look forward to some more of
63 your enjoyable writing soon.
64      Alex, I'm a 'fair weather bum' and with any luck I'll be making passage
65 for warm, sunny latitudes before the great river contests begin. My present
66 predilection is more toward 'blue water cruiser'.
67      Melissa, If I read your last message correctly you are out of town for
68 a week or so and probably won't get this and the other messages of late. On
69 the off chance you do let me add my support. God knows I love you!

73 WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND... IS WHY TILEAN WRITES LIKE A
74 PAST PRESIDENT USED TO TALK... WITH A LOT OF PAUSES...
75 IF THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THOUGHT... IT IS VERY POORLY
76 CONSTRUCTED... WHO THINKS WITH PERIODS... IT GETS PRET
77 TY BORING AFTER A FEW... LINES AND IT DOESN'T READ....
78 VERY GOOD EITHER... MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES... IF THAT'S
79 WHAT YOU CALL THEM... HAVE I GOT A NICE BRIDGE IN TOWN
80 TO SELL YOU... SINCE I AM JUST THINKING HERE... THAT'S
81 THE REASON FOR ALL THE .S... I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR
82 OWN NAPOLGIC FOR SAYING WHAT WAS ON HIS OR HER'S MIND,
83 AND SPEAKING THE TRUTH FELT BY SEVERAL... CONSTANT HAP
84 PY MESSAGES... I FEEL I AM GETTING SICK TO MY STOMACH.
85 YOU'LL PROBABLY TEAR ME APART... IT MAKES YOU FEEL  SO
86 MUCH BETTER TO BELITTLE ME... YOU ARE A LEGEND IN YOUR
87 OWN TIME. GO A HEAD AND MAKE YOUR SELF HAPPY.... I CAN
88 UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELINGS... SURE... ASSASINATE ME WITH
89 PANDY POEMS... HALF ARE PROBABLY STOLEN ANYWAY... NO O
90 RIGINAL THOUGHT THERE... JUST PASSING TO THINK... DOES
91 NT THIS... PAUSING GET BORING... SPY STORIES YUCK.....
92 ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO TRY TO MAKE YOU THINK.... REASONS
93 FOR IT ARE RIDICULOUS... GETTING TIRED OF THE DOTS....
94 SO AMI... SO I WILL NOW STOP... TIRED... YES... TIRED.
95 
96 So if...you don't.....like it here.....why don't you..
97 just go.....somewhere else....rather than....complain?
98 
99 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

	As, pent in an aquarium, the troutlet
101 	Swims round and round his tank to find an outlet,

103 	Nor ever sees the prison that enfolds him;
104 	So the poor debtor, seeing naught around him,
105 	Yet feels the narrow limits that impound him,
106 	Grieves at his debt and studies to evade it,
107 	And finds at last he might as well have paid it.

110   i am sorry to hear that you do not like the way i write... i will not and can not change simply because you slashed at it...
111 i will not assasinate your character... nor will i ask for a surge of hatefull messages towards you...
112 
113   all the messages in defense of melissa... and most messages in defense of anybody is that they are crude... usually needless
114 and harsh...
115 
116   i hate enter only... let me restate... most people object to slanderous messages or cruel messages because they are neerless
117 and maddening... if you simply must say something so blasted slanderous... tell it to a friend... and if you have no friends
118 at all to complain to... i suggest you change yourself... that sort of intollerance is not sanctity... it is stupidity... and
119 i will defend that point if necessary...
120 
121 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
122 
123   adrian and papa smurf... thank you very much for the praise... i like knowing some people find it... interesting...?
124 
125 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
126 
127   napologic'n... your message is vague on some points.... for instance... were you defending the present assassin... or were
128 you simply explaining why they do what they do... or were you only pointing out the lack of difference between the sides...?
129   all of the above perhaps... maybe even a glimmer of resentment...?
130 
131 ...........................................................................
132 Regarding the suggestion (on db ) that we change Backwater... Sorry, no
133 can do! The ENTIRE system is in HARDWARE. It runs out of some 2708 EPROMs.
134 (or was that 2702?) Mikey doesn't know where to get a programmer for them
135 Neither do I. And we don't have all the source code. And Mikey doesn't
136 have time to rewrite what we do have. I'm trying, at the moment the system
137 I would be using is down... 
138 In any case the type of changes you suggested are WAY down the list. 
139     Sorry 'bout that.....

143 PaPa: I feel that I must again apologize for my actions(or lack thereof) at the Hitchhiker party. I am sorry. I will
144 try very hard to be a bit more friendly in the future.
145 tilean: You have my support 100%(for all it's worth).

147 Carefully I loked to my right. Good, she was asleep. I didn't think I could have stood her constant., passenger seat 
148 driving and kibitzing. God, she was breathtakingly beautiful, and a joy to be around, but get her into a car... I'd rather
149 not think about it. But she was asleep now, and I was not about to let the think-time go by unused. It was difficult to 
150 keep my thoughts on anything but this woman lying next to me, and the way the light from the occasional streetlamp
151 carressed her soft features, one at a time as it flowed onto her, and then was gone, to be replaced at odd intervals by 
152 the next. IMy attention was drawn temporarily by the  "Campground, 1 mile" sign on the side of the road. I don't think my
153 eyes left her for more than one of the 60 seconds it took to reach the turn-off.
154      After maneuvering the car to an acceptable hposition in the small grass area, I brought two blankets from the back
155 seat. One quickly found a place on Christine's shoulders, and the other on mine.
156 I just lay there and watched her for what must have been hours, . As I drifted off to sleep, thoughts of her were still
157 lingering in my mind. It was almost as if she had awakened something long dormant, a feeling whose existance had gone 
158 utterly unnoticed for years...

162 To All:  A note of misuderstanding seems to be floating thru the air at the
163          Inn. I have received compliments for a poem.  I have not written a
164          poem in quite some time. My CPU time is currently being used on my
165          and Jack hoovers story "The Great Peanut Butter Caper". Sorry, I wish
166          I had written the poem.

168      The sun shown thru the levolors onto the desk. It was a rather ordinary
169 piece of furniture. A desk of pine, Tina's desk to be exact. Behind the desk
170 sat the owner, she was small; about 5 feet 2 inches, her blue eyes were clear.
171 Her hair the color of a wheat field at harvest.  She wore a simple blue shkirt
172 and a virgin white blouse. Her face held a stern expression as she gazed at the
173 others that had joins her this morning.
174      Tony felt uneasy, he had waited for the moment for quite a while and now
175 with the reality of danger, he wanted to get this job over with. He wore workers
176 overalls and had a n electrician kit on the fllor next to where he sat.
177      Jack was flying, the pain pills the doctor had prescribed were maiking him
178 for the time being quite useless. It had been 6 hours since he last took the p
179 pills and he would need another dose in a hour or so.
180     Marci waited for Tina to start. The plan was simple enough but they all 
181 needed to review just one more time. Marci also was wearing the garb of a common
182 laborer.
183     Tina stood and adressed the group. 
184     " My good friends and associates, Tommorow morning Jack and I will enter
185 the pits of the New York Stock Exchange. At this time we will purchas Jiff
186 stock, we will do so as slowly as possible as to not attract attention. We
187 have 323,000 to spend, we must be sly. At the present time Jiff is selling
188 for 9.46 a share. Take note ladies and gentlemen that Peter Pan is selling
189 for 35.12 a share. We will then let the market sit for 2 days. I will moniter
190 carefully the prices and we will make our moves accordingly.
191     Tina then turned and faced Tony.
192     " Tony this is wher you come in, You are to lead Marci and yourself into
193 the corporate distribution center at Peter Pan.  Once inside the warehouse
194 you must put one of these into each of the storage containers."
195     Tina hands Tony a vinal  bag containing aprox 200 pen sized capsules.
196     " these capsules with produce a chemical reaction that will cause
197 the peanut in the peanut butter to disintegrate. When they open the con-
198 tainers all they will find is salt and oil..  We call this little miracle
199 "the Jimmy Carter".
200     Tony was pumped and ready to go, this would be the most fun he's had 
201 in years. He leaned over and got his work bag. Opening it he removed and 
202 inspected his cutting torch. He turned and leared at Marci.

211    In the stables attached to the inn, the innkeeper's faithful steed
212 was startled to find a visitor one morning.  Long accustomed to a solo
213 existence, the poor beast did not quite know what to do about the 
214 strange beast in the stall next to him.  Even more startling
215 was the breadth of her wingspan when she unfolded her wings, one at
216 a time and stretched each thououghly.
217   The piper was walking through the fine curling fingers of mist, his
218 plaid, somewhat the worse for wear, wrapped tightly around his s
219 shoulders to ward off the evening chill.  He hesitated to enter the 
220 battered wooden door -- it had been so long since his last venture.
221   What had happened to his companions from the Ruby Valley?  Looking
222 about, the inn seemed to have lost substance -- much effort had gone
223 into building this rustic structure, but the wooden treads of the 
224 steps were worn deeply by the boots of the travellers who had frequented
225 this place.  Pausing by the Rowan tree planted by the door, the piper
226 carefully plucked a single twig and twined it in the wool of his plaid.
227    Shivering with the chill, he walked to the door and pushed it open,
228 nearly tearing his hand on the rough splinters that had been raised 
229 from the iron-bound wood.  A welcome and familiar sight came into 
230 view through the half-darkness of the room he entered.  On the far
231 side of the room,  the innkeeper stood behind a polished bar, 
232 dispensing wisdom along with refreshment, while the well-used tables
233 and benches were filled with excited, happy customers.  Several new
234 (to the piper) storytellers were practicing, perfecting their craft
235 to the general applause of the patrons, while perfecting their 
236 defenses against those who joy in vandalism.  The atmosphere of the 
237 inn seemed quite restrictive -- the door had posted upon it a sighn
238 reading "ENTER ONLY" -- but the piper smiled.  
239   These times have been here before.  Usually the assasins of character
240 are the same vandals who would have defaced the entries of others.
241 Deprived of their infantile amusement, many turn to anonomous disparagin
242 remarks, hoping to quiet the voices that they could not obliterate 
243 with the REPLACE or DELETE commands.  Quietly moving over to the bar,
244 the piper ordered a glass of the inn's famous nut-brown ale and
245 remarked to the inkeeper, "even these character attacks have their
246 use.  Our new writers must learn to face adverse opinions and hold
247 their own against them.  Ultimately, each must learn to please only
248 one critic -- themselves, and also learn that they must be their own
249 harshest critic.  Unfortunately, many never learn to be fair to 
250 themselves, and confuse criticism with condemnation."

256 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (of comments)
257 I usually have tryed not to make camment as to the dark ones, as observed by Piper above, but would like to make the 
258 following statements.    The magnanimous user/patron/compatriot known as the 'alchemist' has reminded us of an 
259 institution that he has tryed to institute amung us for the short time of a month. He has seemed to have failed at his
260 attempt at allowing us to enjoy the atmosphere here at the Inn. The only person that has abided to his most simple of 
261 guide lines is one that I am not certain has read them. Needless to say of course that the Piper himself shares in the 
262 quility of magnanimity, and has never, too my short knowledge, done anything that may have been construed as belittleing
263 another that has been bold enough to venture through that most firm of portals, the entrance of our most precious Inn.
264 On behalf of the alchemist, i would like to say again in effect what it is that he has said before me...
265   Try to let this month go by without stooping so low as to join the ranks of those that degrade by allowing ourselves
266 to fall into the dis-honor of speaking rashly in return to their snide remarks. If you find that you must return a 
267 statement to the dark ones, TRY to make it a gracious inquiry rather than a redundant display. Hoping that my words 
268 have not caused my meaning to be misunderstood, I shall leave the entire stituation at that. The responce that I give,
269 the same as those of that most great of Academies (not NETs), shall be one and the same. For those that breach ANY 
270 Code of Honor, the Silent Treatment is your.

275      I remember Eddie.  He was my best friend.  I remember playing in the
276 autumn leaves, turning somersaults on the lawn, and laying on our backs
277 watching the clouds go by.  Most of all, I remember his funeral.  It was
278 held in the white Baptist church on the corner.
279      I stood proud in my Cub Scout uniform.  I remember running my hands
280 along the burnished wooden pews.  I saw the tears on his mother's face,
281 heard the pain in her cries... and I wondered.
282      Eddie fired a single bullet into his brain.  An accident, they said.
283 A child's game gone wrong.  I wondered.
284      The minister talked of what a fine boy Eddie was.  He was going to
285 sit with Jesus in heaven... Happy forever.  I gazed upon his father's
286 despair... and wondered.
287      My innocence left me that May afternoon, gone with Eddie's young soul.
288 My life was full of questions.  The questions... no one could answer.  I
289 plunged into the swirling mists of the fog.  My nights were full of terror
290 and tears.  I skirted the edges of maddness... alone... helpless... 
291 seeking answers.
292      Slowly the answers came, within.  By high school, I could cope
293 normally.  I knew that this life was all I had.  Death awaited me...
294 inevitabl;ee... final.  I accepted the reality of my own death.  The fog
295 cleared.
296      I was a shaggy-haired young man when I discovered I was not alone.
297 Sartre and Camus had trod the awlful path before me.  I learned that all
298 I could do in this life was learn and grow... flow and change.  Knowledge
299 and discovery were all that made life worthwhile.
300      I accept my fate now and strive for the best I can do.  But no matter
301 what I achieve or learn, I'll remember Eddie.  He was my best friend.

351          The Cat Came Back (author unknown...)
352 Old Mister Johnson had troubles of his own
353 He had a yellow cat which wouldn't leave its home
354 He tried and he tried to give the cat away
355 He gave it to a man going far, far away.
356 Chorus: But the cat came back the very next day
357         The cat came back, they thought he was a goner;
358         But the cat came back, it just couldn't stay away.
359 The man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight
360 He loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamite
361 He waited and he waited for the cat to come around
362 Ninety-seven piece of txe man is what they found.
363 CHORUS
364 He gave it to a little boy with a dollar note
365 Told him to take it up the river in a boat
366 They tied a stone around its neck, it must have weihed ten pound
367 Now they drag the river for the little boy that's drowned.
368 CHORUS
369 He gave to a man going up in a ballon
370 He told him to take it to the man in the moon
371 The balloon came down about ninety miles away
372 Where he is now, well, I dare not say.
373 CHORUS
374 He gave it to a man going way out west
375 Told him to take to the one he loved the best
376 First the train hit the curve, then it jumped the rail
377 Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tale.
378 CHORUS
379 The cat it had some company one night out in the yard
380 Someone threw a bootjack, and they threw it mighty hard
381 It caught the cat behind the ear, she thought it rather slight
382 Wxen along came a brick-bat and knocked the cat out of sight.
383 CHORUS
384 Away across the ocean they did send the cat at last
385 Vessel only out a day and making water fast
386 People all began to pray, the boat began to toss
387 A great big gust of wind came by and every soul was lost.
388 CHORUS
389 On a telegraph wire, sparrows sitting in a bunch
390 The cat was feeling hungry, she thought she'd like them for lunch
391 Climbing softly up the pole, and when she'd reached the top
392 Put here foot on the electric wire, which tied her in a knot.
393 CHORUS
394 The cat was in possesion of a family of its own,
395 With seven little kittens, 'til there came a cyclone
396 It blew the house all apart, and knocked the cat around
397 The air was full of kittens, not a one was ever found.
398 CHORUS
399 The atom bomb fell just the other day
400 The H-bomb fell in the very same way
401 Russia went, England went, and then the U.S.A.
402 The human race was finished, and without a chance to pray.
403 CHORUS
404 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
405 ....could I interest YOU in a cat sir?......

408 Just a thought as I pass through... I have frequently compared the Backwater to a bathroom wall I once knew. On 
409 further reflection, however, I believe I have done a disservice to the people here. After all it is not the hardware
410 and software that make BWMS special (although they help a lot!), but the people. You are special people, and many 
411 have a gift for words that far exceeds my own; I stand humble before you. There is a talent on this board that is 
412 born out of the opportunity we give each other to practice and explore our writing, of whatever sort. What we have
413 here is a writers' workshop of the best kind: one where a writer is judged solely on the basis of his/her (its?) work
414 without regard to any other outward manifestation (well, maybe there's a bit of prejudice about all caps, but...).
415 I honor of this writers' cameraderie I bestow on the Innhabitants a new name: from henceforth let them also be known
416 (in respectful memory of another similarly oriented group) as the Innklings.

420 Innklings?  INNhabitants?  Anyone care to vote?
421 L'homme: Due to lack of time (boy, where IS that Doctor when you need him?), I haven't made an entry.  To be on the
422 safe side, expect an entry for the story every two or three days, for about the next month.  Advanced classe   
423 programming projects, scholarship applications, etc. are keeping me quite busy nowadays.  (Yes, Alex, I have stopped
424 working on Level 4 code for the duration.)
425 #$##$##$##$#
426 Imagine the following scenario (this is NOT a regular 'NET' entry):
427 #$##$##$##$#
428 "Good morning, Greg."  He'd come to wake me up in the morning.
429 "C'mon, get up.  There's no school today, so let's go eat some breakfast at Wendy's.", he said
430 "All right.  Say, don't you have State Farmers interviews today?"
431 "Yes, that's why I'm going to town in the first place.  Get dressed."
432 And so I dressed, and we left my house without a word to my parents.  There was snow out, but Greg had plenty of
433 experience driving in it and his car had snow tires on it.  We buckled in, just in case.
434 Estacada is a long way from anywhere.  It's a twenty mile drive just into Clackamas, where the Wendy's was.  One
435 particular strech of road, called Carver Curves, has been called 'the most treacherous slice of asphalt in Oregon'.
436 We took it slow.  Our worries were unfounded- we had no problem navigating to Clackamas.
437 After breakfast, we checked the place where the interviews were being held.  'Cancelled', the sign read.
438 Back to Clackamas we drove.  We wasted a bit of time there, then began back home.
439 By now, the roads were well-traveled upon.  Slush was on the roads in most places.  We began tobreathe a bit easier.
440 Then we hit the Curves.  Anyone who knows this area at all knows that you SLOW DOWN.  The snow inspired further 
441 sluggishness.  We made it 3/4ths through....
442 Until the packed snow began to behave like ice.
443 The car began to skid to the other lane.  Greg, used to this sort of thing, corrected matters.  Then we started to
444 skid in the other direction.  Toward the edge of the road.
445 Have you ever been in a car wreck?  There's this brief instant of #This isn't happening to me, is it?# and another of
446 complete numbness.  I hardly felt my head hit the top of the car as we rolled down 15' to a tree where we finally
447 settled right-side-up.
448 I remember distinctly what happened.  I reached over and turned the ignition off.  Then I said, "This is not fun."
449 Greg, by this time, had recovered.  Both of us wear glasses and I looked for them while he climbed out of the 
450 now-shattered driver's side window and swore a few times.
451 I'll never forget last Tuesday.  It made me a believer in seatbelts.  Both Greg and I were able to walk away from the
452 car, him with two small scratches from the glass, and me with a bruise.  The car was 'totaled though- it was an
453 expensive lesson to learn.
454 #$##$##$##$##$#
455 The above is not just a story.  It's how I spent last Tuesday.  Greg is not my friend's real name, but other than that
456 it is as precise as I could make it.  I'm still not sure why I'm entering it at all except that I feel a need to share
457 an experience that showed me how mortal we all are.

486 person of godly name above,
487 		Your praise, I am sure, has been taken to heart. I like the stuff she puts
488 in as well. I am biased actually, because I am the one that is sharing in the
489 present events that she is relating. Don't say that you don't belong here
490 because the words you share are put together very well. You do have a place
491 with the rest of us.
492 kathyx,  wow. I'll try to live up to your last entry. More news at 11 (?)
493 Dr. Frankenstupe and Farley,  Don't let ANYone say your not 'human'. Your 
494  passages made me freeze and take another look at my own life. Thank you for
495  permiting us a glimpse at your personal lives. We are touched.

512    Leaning on the bar, the piper exploded in a spray of ale as the bard
513 finished his song.  Wiping the excess ale from his mustache and beard, the
514 piper threaded his  way through the patron's tables over to the bard, then
515 sat down.  Looking about, he was quite impressed by both the quantity and
516 quality of the contributions at the inn.  Leaning over the table, he
517 implored sofly of the bard,  "please don't do that to me.  I love to laugh
518 but exploding is slightly painful!"
519 pppppppppppppppppp
520    To all -- could we perhaps generate some positive energy?  Not that we aren't
521 now, let's see what we can do as a concious effort.  I believe that the universe
522 replies to us in the tone in which we address it.  I try to approach it as
523 confident, comfortable, and competent.  I normally don't project my fears,
524 insecurities, and deficiencies.  More often than not, this approach brings
525 potentially problematical situations into a much more comfortable state --
526 one that I can deal with.  
527   My proposal is this -- try to say something complimentary about one
528 particular person.  Complimenting the whole group doesn't count, you should
529 address your remarks to a single person (and hopefully someone who will
530 need the praise).  If you cannot find something in someone else to honestly
531 praise, you should enter something that praises you, yourself.
532   I implore anyone who attempts this, however, to be completely honest.  False
533 praise is perhaps one of the most cutting insults of all.
534 
535 Just to lead off -- I don't know your name, or recognize the border (it seems
536 that a lapse of a few days can render a special border public domain again)
537 but this is to you who left the poem bordered by "?!?!?!?!?!".
538   Thank you.  You have given me a memory that will light up some of the
539 darker moments of my day.  A clever poem deserves to be shared, and adds
540 to the richness of life of those who share it.  Some questions:
541 Is it original?  if not, to whom is it attributed?  purpose: to find out
542 if more is available.

546 Piper:  (upper case for calling; lower when in context?) I was once writing a
547       story called "The Young Master West" and had the strange notion that it
548       would be alright to include you in it for just a short while. Would this
549       be alright with you? I think I understand the viewpoints you hold that 
550       would be the part in that episode- the boy needs a sage's advice. The 
551       problem is that the episode would require thinking back in time as it 
552       would have occured after your return from the Ruby Valley, and before
553       your latest conflict and recouperation. Give my regards to Peg.
554 Prometeus:  "This Is True. Yes,..." and Thank You for the return. (I'm safe!)

558      Alex, aah yes, I remember well those lovely crystal isles. Your comment
559 brought back many fond memories of the times when I also called at ports
560 along that great curving archipelago. Perchance did you partake of that most
561 exquisite honey, lovingly collected by the spice field bees, and sold in the
562 local pharmacy at port St. Georges? My favorite of the islands is two and a
563 half degrees north of there. Do you know of that harbour at the end of the
564 Passe des Trois Ilets, known locally as Anse Mitane? Indeed, sunrise at sea
565 is an experience beyond mere words. Values of the variables that determine
566 the outcome of the great Schrodinger Wave Equation of manifest reality have
567 not yet been fully revealed, thus my future course is yet to be actualized.
568 In a quiet harbour, an elegant lady of the sea is peacefully at anchor. Late
569 at night she sometimes calls, "Skip, come let us spread our wings before the
570 trade winds once again." Though my heart hears the call, as yet the answer
571 is still being formulated. (Ask L'homme for her detailed description.)
