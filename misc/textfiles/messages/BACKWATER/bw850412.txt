22 Kosta:Well we made it didn't we? No AD needed, just try and voila, no problem.... It appears your
23  message on DB was slightly altered by some cretin of the night. I understood what you were saying,
24  but I had inside information. Perhaps you should repeat yourself for the benefit of those who were
25 less enlightened. If I had been more awake, I might have been convinced to drive over to your place
26  of business, since it is so close. Of course the traffic on 82nd is famous this time of year when
27  the weather is nice. A few of my auto-brethern have a sort of V8 fraternity there, and although we
28  may not know each other's names; year, color, wheels, and cubic-inch displacement are never
29  forgotten. It makes for interesting conversation, and very very slow progress from point A to B.
30  Strange enough?

38     It seems my poor jest has drawn the attention of the careless to that which
39 is best not trifled with.  was dreamtoucher's comment to person, as a drama of
40 the sort once thought banished from these enchanted premises.
41     Thair are three of them and there are three of us, perhaps this is some sort
42 of cosmic sign, mused person out loud.
43     The mater seemed to have been quickly, if messily settled before elf wolf
44 and reality switching mystic spirit, could take the initiative to intervene.
45     It seames that a dinosaur whom a sharp pointy object nudges, cant be blamed
46 for harboring grudges, still I hope the children of murphy and phenagle are 
47 still on the job befor the life fluids of those more daring than wise can seep
48 into the gloriosly pollished and petinaed oaken flooring.  No sooner had the
49 pointed eared one spoken than the marks of unexpected beligerance began to dis-
50 appear, as if evaporating into nonexistance.
51      High one or no, I believe the innkeeper may have a word or two in private
52 about the spilling of blood in this place of sanctuary.
53      Perhaps, spoke person, attempting to lighten the mood, Dreamtoucher, you
54 could tell me more of the adventures of this Themnax person?

60      In perfact detatched relaxation he sat in the denter of a circular water-

62      As the Lananaran single-ship began snuggling down warmly through the 
63 planetary atmosphere of Earth, Elxtia reached out and touched the control which
64 fliped it etherial.

77      The traffic in downtown Portland was almost impossible.  It seems
78 like every direction I wanted to go was continually blocked with some
79 sort of construction project.  When they get done doing whatever it is
80 they do, they tear it all apart and start in again.
81      Finally the smokey, smelly, stinking bus pulled away from the
82 curb. It pulled around a nondescript black car, and then stopped for
83 the ever red stoplight.  I thought about moving to the side to get
84 around the car, when another bus pulled up behind the first and opened
85 its doors to off-load its passengers and take on more, effectivly
86 blocking me from that alternative.  Frustrated, I sat behind the black
87 car in my beatup American sports car, expecting yet another long delay
88 in getting out of the city.  
89      As I sat steaming, the door of the car burst open, and a man
90 stepped out.  He stepped in front of a young lady stopping her forward
91 progress.  As she attempted to step around him, he grabed her by the
92 arm and quickly loaded her into the car.  The car then shot forward,
93 running the red light.  Obviously, something was comming down.  
94      A moment later, the light turned green.  Since the car was
95 leaving the city, as was I, I decided to follow at least for a while.
96 The roar of my engine and squealing tires echoed off the close
97 buildings as I hurried to try to catch up with the speeding car.

113    The inn's conversation seemed to fade into the distance as the dark
114 figure again brought out the pack of gaily-colored cards.  The figure's
115 thin fingers flickered briefly and a card slid out of the deck and 
116 flipped over.
117    "Your significator."  The hoarse whisper was heavy with significance.
118 "This card represents you.  It represents who and what you are -- how 
119 you react, your basic pattern.  We know that humans are more complex, but
120 still humans are cut to a pattern.  Know your pattern and you know you
121 potential.  Know your basic truths and the conseqent truths are obvious."
122   Staring at the picture on the card before him, the piper felt that, if
123 not absolutely true, this person's belief in his own words was absolute.
124 As the dark-robed figure's whisper rasped on, the piper felt himself
125 overcome by a strange lassitude.  As his limbs grew heavier and heavier,
126 the picture on the card seemed to become larger and more detailed.  Fascinated
127 by this phenomenon, the piper focused on the face of the man pictured on
128 the card.  As he did so, several other things seemed to happen -- the inn
129 seemed so far away now... the piper's vision seemed to be edged in black, as
130 though he were peering down a long tunnel...  and the face in the card
131 turned a startled look upon the piper.

134      PORTLAND (AP) -- Portland Police reported that noted author and 
135 Backwater Inn regular, Pam, disappeared today under suspicious circum-
136 stances.  A police spokesman stated:  "Yes, we are working on the
137 possibility that Pam may have been kidnapped.  We have identified several
138 suspects and arrests are imminent."
139      An unreliable witness, Hector 'Red Herring' Breakwind said that he
140 observed a young woman thought to be Pam struggling with a fat man and a
141 large bearded lady in downtown Portland.  "Hey, I thought it was a simple
142 beef between circus performers."  Mr. Breakwind said, "I mean they threw
143 this short broad into the back of a large circus truck and took off."  Mr.
144 Breakwind was returning to his office at McKane Industries after a five
145 martini lunch.
146      Pam is described as sweet, gnome-like, and has an affliction for 
147 painful puns.  The Backwater Gnome Appreciation Society has offered a
148 gigantic reward of $47.39 for Pam's safe reward.  Persons with information
149 regarding Pam's disappearance should contact Salazar at the Pam Hotline,
150 230-xxxx.

163 "Vice, Cranston speaking."
164 "Ahh...  err....  I'm calling about that broad what was kidnapped 
165 in the paper this morning."
166 "Hey Seltzer!  Get your buns over here!  Got a call for ya.  Some 
167 guy, says he knows something about that Pam chick who got grabbed 
168 yesterday."
169 
170 "Yeah? What 'uv ya got?"
171 "Yeah,  ahh..  I just wanted to say that ah, that Red Herring guy 
172 was wrong, it wasn't a circus fat man what grabbed that broad. It 
173 was some kinda military type in civies.  He grabbed her and threw 
174 her in the back of a black car and took off.  He ran a red light, 
175 so maybe ya can get him on that." 
176 "Get a license number?"
177 "Well, ah no, the plate was covered with mud."
178 "Alright, anything else?"
179 "Ah,  yeah,  there was this guy in a sports car right behind them 
180 that pealed out after 'em."
181 "What did he look like?"
182 "Well,  I don't know,  didn't get a very good look at him. He was 
183 drivin'  one  o' them fancy sports cars.  I think it had  one  of 
184 those spoiler do-hickies on the back or somthin'. I don't rightly 
185 remember the color, but it was dark."
186 "OK, get a license?"
187 "Ah,  yeah,  it was one of them fancy special jobies,  I think it 
188 said 'sisy poop' or 'cysty oop', somthing like that."
189 "OK, can you give me your name?"

  When she came through the door it struck me again just how 
199 
beautiful she really was.  Dripping from the shower she could take my 
200 
breath away.  I adjusted the covers to hide my reaction as I watched 
201 
her getting dressed.  Now wasn't the time, mornings aren't her thing.
202 
  "I feel like french toast, do you have any bread?", she said over 
203 
her shoulder as she poked through me closet.  She likes to wear my 
204 
shirts when she stays here.  I think it makes here feel sexy, I know 
205 
it makes her look that way.
206 
  "Who kneeds it." I said.
207 
  "Oh God, not puns, not this early. Seriously, do you have any f/od 
208 
in this damn place?"
209 
  "She criticized my apartment, so I knocked her flat." I said with 
210 
a smile.
211 
  "Do you want breakfast or not". She said, putting her hands on her 
212 
hips in mock anger.  The shirt looked great, she was still a little 
213 
wet from the shower, and it was sticking to her in some of my 
214 
favorite places.
215 
  "I want knot," I said. "Come over here and I'll show you some of my 
216 
rope tricks."
217 
  "You already did you pervert." I love that smile.
218 
  "Once a king always a king...?" I asked.
219 
  "But once a night is enough!" She finished. "You got your quota 
220 
for the week."
221 
  "That`s right I do feel pretty weak.  All your fault."
222 
  "Not my fault, San Andreas, didn't you feel the earth move?" She 
223 
asked.
224 
  I laughed. "As a matter of fact I did.  You have a point."
225 
  She pointed to the bl!nkets. "You have the point, not me."
226 
  "I'm not prone to argue."
227 
  "And I don't feel like cooking any more." She said with a smile. 
228 
She undid the top button of my shirt, pulling the fabric away from 
229 
her wet skin.
230 
  "The hell you don,t, you just don't feel like breakfast."
231 
  We didn't even make it to lunch.
232

236 	Hmm. Those were NOT experienced mercs. At least not with pre-
237 gunpowder weapons. The only reason that hammer (& mace) fighters aren't
238 more common is that it takes strength AND dexterity. If you let a man 
239 with a mace in close enough to use it, you'd better have a SHIELD to 
240 hide behind!
241 	I'm not sure that they deserved to be handled QUITE so harshly,
242 but at the the species has been improved. Good manners ARE a survival
243 trait!

245 ps. some of you probably have this mental picture of some sort of short-

250      In the pale light of a cresent moon, two figures climbed through
251 jumbled blocks of stone toward a mountain pass above.  Ming's breath came
252 in ragged gasps, his legs ached from exertion.  Ahead of him, Mohammed
253 moved as one born to climbing.
254      "Hold on Mohammed, let's rest a moment."  Ming panted.  "I'm a city
255 kid, not a crusty mountain goat like you."
256      Mohammed Wassir turned and saw Ming Louie flop onto a flat stone.  "We
257 can only halt for a moment, dawn will come in a few hours.  We must reach
258 the pass by then.  Great night for climbing, eh?"
259      "Right.  Maybe you're as crazy as they say."  Sweat trickled down
260 Ming's brow.
261      Mohammed chuckled.  "We are all a little crazy.  My friend, life must
262 be lived on the razor's edge."
263      The men lapsed into silence in the cool Afghan night.  In the distance
264 a bird trilled softly.  "Hmmm... What kind of bird is that?"  Ming asked.
265      "Quiet."  Mohammed whispered.  He gazed into the darkness.  Shadows
266 moved against the blackness.  The bird called again.
267      Both men froze.  The click of rock grazing rock sounded near them.
268 Mohammed's knife slipped into his hand.  Ming shed his backpack and 
269 unlimbered a short fighting staff.
270      Whoosh!  Something embedded itself in Mohammed's robe.  An arrow.
271 Warcries sounded in the night.  Four figures emerged from the rocks
272 charging the two men.
273      Mohammed sidestepped an onrushing form.  His knife plunged into the
274 figure's back.  Hot blook gushed over his hand.  He turned to grapple with
275 his next adversary.
276      Ming snapped his staff into a charging man's throat.  A spinning kick
277 finished his foe.  From the corner of his eye, he spied something flashing
278 in the moonlight.  A knife.  It hammered against his chest.  "Sorry sucka."
279 Ming said.  His ballistic vest absorbed the impact of the blow.  He jabbed
280 the end of his staff into the figure's midsection and dropped him with a
281 backfist.
282      Clunk.  Clunk.  Clunk.  Ming looked over.  Mohammed was cracking the
283 remaining figure's head against a rock.  "Hold it Mohammed.  I think he's
284 done."
285      "Er... right.  Get a light.  Let us see who attacks us."
286      Ming returned to his pack and pulled out a small flashlight.  He 
287 walked over and handed it to Mohammed.
288      The yellow beam of the light revealed four smallish men; their black,
289 straight hair cut salad-bowl style.  Short, woolen robes covered their
290 nut-brown bodies.  Strange circular tattoos marked their faces.
291      "Who are those guys?  They certainly aren't Russians."  Ming said.
292      "My guess would be Indians... probably from South America."  Mohammed
293 examined the arrow he pulled from his robes.  "If I'm correct, this arrow
294 has been coated with Curare."
295      "Why would they attack us?  Hmmm... I wonder if this is connected
296 to Salazar's message."
297      "My friend, we have no time to ask questions.  The Russians could
298 discover us at any minute."
299      Suddenly, a blinding light.  Both men crouched--disoriented.  A 
300 heavily accented voice said,  "Too late, Wassir.  We're here.  Don't move.
301 I would hate to be denied the distinct pleasure of interrogating you.
302 I love breaking tough guys."

325   "Hand Ho!!" cried the lookout, leaning far out over the crows
326 nest.
327    It had been several months since Salty and his moltly crew
328 had felt the touch of stable earth under their feet. Tempers
329 had started to rise and all needed the rest.  Supplies were
330 also running low and repairs needed to be made. Not to mention
331 there was women that needed chasing, so Salty set sail for 
332 the mainland.  The crew had lowered the Jolly Rodger and replace
333 it with a british flag. Oh they looked so innocent if you dis-
334 regarded the holes punched into the side of the ship by the
335 victims who tried in vain to defend themselves against the
336 mightiest of warriors of the sea.
337      The anchor was lowered and launches were put out, leaving
338 only a handfull of men behind to keep watch on the ship. Sacks
339 of gold were taken along to buy goods (and services).
340      Black thunder watched longingly as his new comrades rowed
341 away from the ship.  he was the new first mate by default and
342 would have to stay behind for now.
343     The boats were pulled up on the beach and the men stumbled
344 forward, many falling promptly on faces to feel the warm sand
345 against their bodies.  Palm trees swayed in the gentle breeze
346 as the men composed themselves and moved on, much stimulated
347 by their insistant captain.
348     Salty led the way and soon the crew reached a major road
349 leading into a township, the men must have looked quite
350 ragged judging by the stares from the passing civlians.
351    Salty pulled our a large bag of gold and generously gave
352 each of his men amounts to get cleaned up and please them-
353 selves, warning them to meet back at the beach in two days.
354 Salty and his cabin boy walked down the road the a
355 clothier and found suitable coverings for the next year and
356 continued on to a INN that boasted of hot baths and good
357 ale.

392 s:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:ks:
393 
394  I walked past the garden. It was full of her herbs:cucumber, white rose, any 
395 white, yellow, or wet plants. The garden was surrounded by willow trees; and my 
396 staff bent towards them-it knew it was the same.
397 
398  I waved to some Mars followers (pagans, but devout), and a member of His cult. 
399 I was surprized that they were walking together-He lovees life and Mars destroys
400 it. His worshipers rarely associated with anyone but Us; and even then, only for
401 Their procreation. But, as the man was hardly a man, I assumed the prejuduces 
402 hadn't been hammered into him yet.
403  After I turned a corner, I heard yells from the direction I had come. Sincee, 
404 as a Mother, it is my duty to keep peace; I went back. The pagans were attacking
405 the allmost-man.
406 
407  She must love Mars, for She gave me a dream before I could help him. I cannot 
408 tell what the dream was about, suffice to say that it kept me from stopping the 
409 fight before it began. By the time I returned to reality, the almost-man was 
410 bleeding. In Mars worrshipers blood arouses lust, in Mothers it creates only 
411 anger. They started attacking anything that moved, and I-being one person-could 
412 only watch and curse them. Perhaps I shouldn't say "only", Her curses are always
413 deadly, but they didn't stop the violence.
414  "Think, think," my brain said. But I wouldn't listen. They had drawn blood on 
415 Her soil, and they shall die for it. I could imagen the months it would take to 
416 cure the roses alone, the rocks would have to be changed. As I was tthinking 
417 about curing and changing, my mind gave me an idea from Her. I doffeed my green 
418 robes so I was wearing only my white cape. I must love them to cure them. They
419 must be cured of thier lust. If it had been sexual, I could have destroyed it 
420 easily; but blood lust is alien to Her, and I would have to work hard. Part of 
421 me wanted to let the violence run its  course and just cure the land. But these 
422 were Her sons-though they denied it, and I must help them if I could.
423  In my mind's indicision, my Power took over. It cured the men of thier lust and
424 the almost-man of his fear. I just wastched it happen.
425  They collapsed, and then 'I' could act. I took thier wounds and gave them to 
426 Mars--he should enjoy them. And I took the almost-man to the Dean who reprimand-
427 ed him for poor judggdement and me for failure to protect Her children.
428 
429  I don't understand why some of us persist in following a power that only wishes
430 to see destruction. These powers only kill them in the end.

454      As he made his way throug the living room, and then through the dining
455 room the dog had followed.  AAside from the dog there were only the three others
456 in the house...  Janet Fields, a friend before the years in the "service"; her
457 father, who was only ever refered to as simply Mr. Fields; and the one they had
458 called Lewis.
459      "Where is your father this evening?  I thought you said you and he were 
460 alone this evening.  It appears more to the fact that you are here alone," m
461 he mentioned as he surveyed the surroundings.
462      "Oh, he's here alright.  He's just out feeding the cats...  As much as he 
463 likes to let on that he hates them, he really cares for them."
464      "Very well.  Jannet, I seem to recall that there is a small airfield near 
465 here.  Could you tell me how I could get there?" he asked.
466      "Ahem," came a gruff voice from off to the side.  It was Jannet's father. 
467 "You turn left from Orchard until you hit Tucker Road, then you make another

475 THOR looked at his terrible tool and noted to himself that it would not need
476 cleaning. The stainless steel head of the hammer still gleamed in the moonlight.
477 The blood of the mercenaries had fallen away like water on a waxed apple. The
478 feel of the weapon was as if it were alive as the hammers head was twice the
479 size of THOR's palm and the movement inside the hammers head could be felt from
480 the liquid mercury that was inside. When THOR swung the terrible tool it was if
481 it was alive and the mercury gave it the momentum to carry through the most
482 thickest of shields. The iron wood handle felt warm in THOR's grip and the few
483 scratches it showed were from glanced
484 sabers and spears that had been thwarted away from THOR's body. He felt no
485 anguish for the death of the two mercenaries but felt awkward inside over having
486 shown his power within the walls of the INN. "I must be more controlled"
487 thought THOR to himself, old habits of self preservation are hard to conquor.
488 I will make amends to the INN keeper on my next visit, perhaps I will atone my
489 outburst with the making of new friends and collegues.....mayber even teach 
490 others to be more tolerant.....we will see.

494 I must retest my upload software, having reassembled my entire system to get rid
495 of the patches, and in ENTER ONLY I've got to say something other than TESTING. 
496 So I'll take this opportunity to clear up a bit of confusion.  It's come to my
497 attention that I am suspected of being the person who uses the signature PRO.
498 This is not an unreasonable guess since my messages elsewhere reveal that I have
499 done professional writing as well as programming--but I am not THAT "Pro", and I
500 don't agree with his/her comments, at least not with respect to this Inn (they
501 would have been valid enough in a writing class).  Not everybody has an upload
502 program.  I wouldn't have one if I couldn't write it myself; and in that case my
503 own entries would be a mess, since I'm a slow and clumsy typist.  I envy you
504 people who can be CREATIVE while typing ON LINE; that in itself is more of a
505 talent than some people realize!

558     Salty and company were about to walk up the path to the INN when
559 several persons  exited the INN carrying the limp bodies of two men,
560 blood was on everyone and faces showed no expression of remorse or glee.
561 Salty who ordinarily would not let this bother him, took the hint that
562 this would not be the place for a pleasent bath and beer.  He signaled
563 to Phil that perhaps they should journey further for a more relaxing
564 enviorment. Phil agreed as the strangers walked by, noting that the
565 skulls of the men were quite destroyed. 
566    They soon found another establishment to fit their needs. After freshing
567 up and changing into their new clothes they were ready for a nap.

571 high one with the hammer would like some inteligent conversation?'
572      'Only one way to find out ', was dreamtoucher's reply.  #oh great noble 
573 spirit#,was dreamtouchers precautionary sending,#may we join you at table?#
574      While the elf could discern no direct mental reply, the great one seamed to
575 becon in a most hospitable fassion.
576     As elf and humanoid spirit left their table, snowrunner, the wolf fallowed.
577     She hung back cautiosly, testing every inch of the air with her sensitive 
578 lupine nose.  Satisfied to forgo the usual C. lupis rituals, she simply seated 
579 herself on the floor near Thor's chair.
580 Dreamtoucher held up a four fingered hand, open, palm forward, in greeting, and
581 bowed deeply.
