82 And now, another BBC broadcast.
83  
84 1939        1940        1941        1942        1943        1944        1945
85  
86         Wright is in a pub in Scotland. As are several of his fellow airmen.
87 Their airfield is down the lane about four miles. Their planes are waiting for
88 them on a strip near the lane. A lieutenant from the field is driving to
89 gather them up to provide a defense against the nearing enemy aircraft.
90 Fortress Europe is across the Channel.
91  
92         Each of the men is in silent spirits. A few are drinking at their
93 tables, while others are dancing and holding their dates. Each of them is
94 watching the lady on stage. She is singing into a radio microphone. It isn't
95 broadcasting, of course. It is only an item on stage. Rather like the piano,
96 or the stool.
97  
98         Her songs are quiet and sullen. Written during the First World War,
99 each song pertains to the lives of these fliers. It was as if the writer had
100 spent time with each of the men, and spoke with him about the weather during
101 their last flight, and the idiocy of fighting and dying for a dam, as they did
102 during their last flight. All of the men listen to the singer as if she were
103 describing their own endangered lives.
104  
105         At the entranceway, the lieutenant puts his coat on the rack and walks
106 over to Wright. Ordering a drink with a signal of his fingers, the lieutenant
107 briefs Wright.
108  
109         A squadron of Nazi fighters flew over an English trawler on the
110 English Channel in the wingtip arrangement of a Nazi flag. Less that thirty
111 minutes ago, the airplanes crossed the coast at Dover, then shifted direction
112 up the coast of England.
113  
114         It was felt at the time that it was a distraction meant to pull the
115 air defenses of England from another assault. Not wanting to fall prey to the
116 deception, the squadron Wright led was ordered to intercept them from
117 Scotland, leaving the English forces to deal with a predicted onslaught.
118  
119         Official orders had arrived at the airfield by telegraph only a few
120 minutes ago. At the airfield, not only were the orders waiting, but so were
121 the aircraft his fliers were to fly.
122  
123         Wright informs two of his men, and tells them pass the orders on.
124 Briskly, all the men shuffle out the front door, their caps in hand, listening
125 hesitantly to the songs being sung on the stage. Each of them is soon loaded
126 in the back of the military truck out front. Wright steps up into the cab with
127 the lieutenant, and turns on the radio as the truck starts to turn around for
128 the trip back to the field. The truck goes nearly forty feet up the road when
129 it occurs to Wright that he has heard the songs on the radio before. They are
130 strikingly familiar, in fact.
131  
132         Wright opens the fragile door of the truck and runs to the pub. Once
133 in, he runs up to the stage and looks at the singer. Only the barkeep and the
134 waitress are there to see this spectacle. The singer is quiet. She is staring
135 at him as if she were a child. Realization is damning on her face as the
136 noises from the fighter engines start to grow.
137  
138         A few airmen run into the pub. The door stands open as the men stand
139 there. The heavens can be seen in the doorway as the fighters fly within sight
140 of the pub and the truck which holds the rest of the men.
141  
142         Wright signals them to run up to the stage. Once they stand there, he
143 puts his cap firmly over the microphone and tells his men what to say. For
144 three minutes, they speak into the microphone as they speak into the radios in
145 their planes. Ridiculing the Nazi fighter pilots for wasting their ammunition
146 on an empty truck and an empty pub, the pilots estimate an easy victory over
147 an otherwise superior squadron. The pilots pretend to cross the coast of
148 Scotland in search of the disarmed squadron, as they hear the engines fade and
149 the enemy fighters peel off for Germany again.
150  
151         Everyone silently collapses into chairs. Wright finds the transmitter
152 underneath the stage. He lifts it onto the stage and with a sigh of relief, he
153 removes the wires from battery terminals. Rolling back up his sleeves, and
154 straightening his tie, he asks the singer to tell the men about what happened
155 just then. She is silent and indignant.
156  
157         He tells the men that each of these songs were carefully calculated to
158 inform the enemy of the events of the squadron. Those songs of losing a pilot
159 over the Ardennes, losing two plans in the assault on the Sorpe Dam, and
160 tonight, her songs were to lead a squadron of enemy fighters to the pub, where
161 the fliers were to be assassinated.
162  
163         She starts to leave the stage in a burst. Startled, the men grab her
164 arms and keep from ever getting down. Wright looks up to her from the concrete
165 floor, and tells her that the she will never again sing from any stage.
166  
167 1939        1940        1941        1942        1943        1944        1945

190 Cindi: Long time no see. I had the same professor you had at PSU. I also used
191 Backwater for an experiment while preparing my thesis for a minor degree in
192 human sexuality. The question I addressed in my thesis was this: Could human
193 sexual relations improve if there was mutual feedback regarding stylistic
194 elements of the sexual act itself? I had done a great deal of book research
195 on the subject, but I was at the point where I needed an experimental group
196 to test my theories on. The prof suggested a public 'B' style cross match,
197 which as you are probably aware, the Backwater crowd fits perfectly. Now the
198 question, and the problem, was how to test my theories electronically without
199 the Backwater user's knowledge. I came up with an idea that encompassed every-
200 thing I wanted to test, in a totally scientific manner, and no one but myself
201 would be the wiser. It also offered a few side benefits to the users, but that
202 was just icing on the cake.
203 
204 Feedback regarding stylistic elements can apply to other acts besides sex. How
205 about writing? Or more specifically, spelling? SPELL CHECK was born unto
206 Backwater to observe how a cross-section of people would respond to feedback
207 of stylistic elements. Several research papers, including the Mackenzie study
208 from Masters and Johnson, have shown that a vast majority of individuals
209 consider writing an almost sexual act. While the deep-rooted cause of this
210 cross-humanization occurrence is not completely understood, MMPI results have
211 demonstrated this in test cases over and over again. My contention was that
212 by showing people the number of spelling errors they made during a controlled
213 period of time, I could measure their response in the same way I could
214 measure the responses to feedback given by sexual partners.
215 
216 I had high hopes for my study, but like yourself, I was completely taken by
217 surprise by the results. Most of the users took to the spelling analysis with
218 great hostility. Instead of seeing the analysis as a constructive criticism,
219 they saw it has a frontal attack on their abilities as writers and
220 conversationalists. Imagine what that did to my contentions! I repeated the
221 experiment several times over a three year period. I rationalized that
222 perhaps the first time contained some element of shock, and that successive
223 tests would reveal more reasonable results. Unfortunately, I encountered
224 the same reaction each time. While the users were not as hostile, the index
225 of aggression when extrapolated did not show signs of diminishing below
226 accepted levels.
227 
228 There are two possible reasons for these results. The first being that my
229 contentions were wrong and my thesis is unstable. My advisors and all the
230 other studies I researched fully supported my ideas. I hesitate to explain
231 the Backwater problems using this reason. The second possibility is that even
232 though the Backwater users fit the psyche-indices for cross-section 'B'
233 perfectly, some other anomaly in the original testing, or the group itself
234 could be the cause of the problems. I lean towards this 'Backwater Connection'
235 myself. It is possible that through both our studies we have discovered a
236 unique and totally new cross-section category. If that is the case, we should
237 attempt to quantify our findings and, of course, publish the results. I would
238 be very willing to work with you on this project.

261 Once again I wonder at how true your statement above was, it almost sounds
262 like a copy-cat entry... But anyway, based on it being at least marginally
263 true (at least it is pluasible)...I think you are probably making some
264 serious errors thinking that the BBS enviornment fits into the standard
265 interaction and information collection methods that occur and can be assumed
266 in other contact situations. BW is particularly unusual in its open format,
267 and the ability of having total immunity from what is said since no on, not
268 even the system operator can know who you are. There is simply no trace other
269 than what you leave in your message. As a result people tend to be far more
270 open and vocal about what they truely think and feel instead of what they
271 are supposed to think and feel. The other aspect is that by their very
272 nature of being here shows that the people involved have an interest in
273 computers and thus lastest techno-toys and communicating with others via
274 the hidden immunity BW provides. (Notice that the strongest out-cries 
275 were from those whose names were hidden behind a handle.) Perhaps what
276 is really being messured is the real deep down feelings instead of the
277 covering mask that people use to hide those feelings from the general
278 public and even themselves because society inhibits them. I think that
279 you attempts to measure feelings and responses are being lost in other 
280 information. I also think that you are not looking closely enough at
281 the overall view. With the case of the WHO CARES bit, notice that the
282 out-cry became worse when it became apparent that it wasn't just another
283 twit trying to gain attention, but someone seriously trying to affect
284 the thought processes of the people on the system. e.g. When people 
285 became aware that they were being manipulated they got upset. At that
286 point the original data gathering process becomes useless because 
287 stronger deeper feelings have come into effect. The same goes with
288 spell check concept what is happening is that you are attacking the 
289 inner individual. Writting, especially creative writting, comes from 
290 inside the individual. You are being allowed a peek at the very inner
291 soul of the individual. They are opening themselves up and leaving
292 themselves vaulnerable. So when any attack comes, and that is what 
293 spell check is/was, an attack on the individual, they close up and then
294 strike back in self-defense. The spell check amplified it because 
295 it wasn't expressed in human feeling terms, it was harsh and striking
296 you did this wrong, period, no option. This is a slap in the face, and
297 you had damn well better expect the person you slap to get upset and
298 probably fight back. It was not positive critisism, it was harsh 
299 unrelenting, no opotions, this is the way it must be done, slap in
300 the face. That is negative critisism. Positive critisism concentrates
301 on the positive aspects. This is good, that's OK, there's a problem here
302 you might try this or that, this isn't normal and others might object
303 you might try it this way instead. That is positive critisism,
304 not 'You spelled this wrong, it isn't right, you must do my way.'

311 Of course, I knew there was a reason for my intial disclaimer. I remember
312 now who Spellcheck is. I don't know why I didn't remember. Ah well, since
313 I know the individual personally, I also know that it isn't the person 
314 (before my last message) who said that he was. Which leads one to wonder
315 why the the individual wants to call themself Spellcheck.

320 Yes...I think I remember you. Aren't you the guy who used to 
321 hang around with the foriegn exchange students? I think you sat
322 two rows ahead of me between the Albanian political sciences
323 major and the French guy who was a business major. Am I right?
324 
325 I gave up on the MMPI. I could never get my coefficient of
326 correlation below a .10 standard deviation from the norm. I
327 decided to compromise and settle for a battery of projective
328 tests. They're less valid statistically but they served my
329 purposes.

331 It's nice to chat with a fellow social sciences freak. I've

366 We should be honored that Backwater is being used for such tests. I don't see
367 this kind of stuff happening on CBBS/NW or any other unix boards and the like.
368 Instead of complaining about what has happened in the past, let us discuss why
369 we were chosen for these interesting experiments. I don't mind being the subject
370 of such a truly harmless test. Have any of you been hurt? Were you really that

413 CBBS/NW is not a unix system. It runs on an old IMSAI Mainframe, like the sysop
414 Willing calls it, not a unix box. Mr. or Mrs. or Ms Debater probably meant CBBS
415 or other computer systems, including several unix machines in town.

450 INTO THIS GREAT LAND FROM LANDS OF
451 OPPRESSION AND FEAR.  THEY COME TO
452 LEARN, AND GROW IN A PLACE WHERE 
453 THEY CAN BE FREE AND FEEL FREEDOM.
454 
455 THEY THAT PERSECUTE THOSE THAT COME
456 HERE FROM OTHER LANDS, ARE NOT TRUE
457 AMERICANS.  FOR THEIR ANCESTORS 
458 MOST LIKELY CAME FROM OTHER LANDS.
459 BUT THEY THAT COME HERE TO FREELOAD
460 AND LIVE OFF THE GENEROSITY OF OUR
461 PEOPLE ARE NOT TRUE AMERICANS, NOR
462 ARE THAY AMERICANS AT ALL.
463

510 Pardon me, but according to General Patton (who was a 'true American' if anyone
511 ever was) the object is "not to die for your country, but to make the other poor
512 dumb bastard die for HIS country"

565 [+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++To Spellchecker:
566    My question is! Who said that spelling missteaks were spelling errors 
567 and not the guys a lousy typist.

571 ******************************************************************
572 Actually, the *real* Spell Check took that into acount at the time,
573 probable typos were not included in the check. Though typos themselves
574 indicate that the individual is not very carefull in their writing.
575 That in itself is unimportant, but what is important is when the
576 typos spelling errors, poor grammer, and puncuation become so great
577 that they make it difficult to findout what is being said. It is 
578 up to the writer to make themselves understood. The purpose of writing
579 correctly is to draw the reader in so that they will read what you
580 wrote. If they can't read it how can you expect to get your idea across 
581 to them.It is not the responsiblity of the reader to read something
582 just because you wrote it. If you want it to be read, it should be
583 writing in a form that people will want to read, that by the time
584 they've realized that they are reading it they alreay have.

613 And so the end of another disk is at hand. Not the best to be sure,
614 but better than some. For now it is interesting to see how the new
615 disk will fair since with the phone line troubles there will be some
616 delay before it gets used again. That and with christmas now over with
617 there will probably be a change in peoples view point as well as a 
618 flock of new users trying out their spiffy new modems and exploring
619 the wonders of the bbs network.
620 If I keep at this maybe I can fill the disk up. After all, there
621 aren't that many lines left, and all I have to do is babble on pointlessly
622 until the thing becomes full. That shouldn't be too hard for me to do.
623 I am good at babbling on pointlessly. 
624 Only a few lines left and another disk goes off to the archives
625 never to be seen again by human eyes. 
626 The night is pitch black. The rain drinks up the light and what little
627 it gives back is reflected at crazy angles. It becomes impossible to see.

TOTAL NUMBER OF LINES = 628
