 66 Cassandra:  I suppose that depends upon what scientists settle on as
 67 the most energy producing mix.  Secondary radiation (caused by the
 68 neutrons emitted by the reaction) could also be a consideration... it

 91 I've been away for a week -- I was visiting a good friend who was hit
 92 by a drunk on the wrong side of a freeway and survived.  Some things
 93 are more important than fusion (hi, Cynthia! :-).  When I got back, I
 94 discovered that fusion was still in the papers; here are some more
 95 excerpts from local reporting which the country at large seems to have
 96 been spared.
 97  
 98 A bit over a week ago, just before I left, Pons gave a news conference
 99 in which he presented a few more details about the new work going on at
100 the U.  Here are some of Pons's remarks, as reported by the Salt Lake
101 Tribune on April 25th:
102  
103 	U of  chemist B Stanley Pons said Monday [4/24] that his
104 	research team is perfecting anew design for his nuclear fusion
105 	experiment that may be much better suited for an eventual use
106 	as a [sic] energy source.
107  
108 	Dr Pons decined to give specifics on his new experimental
109 	design, other than to say it was 'a clearly dfferent
110 	configuration.' He gave dimensions of a cyliner about a foot
111 	long and 6 inches in diametr.
112  
113 	'If we can charge a very large piece ofpalladium, then the
114 	power will be consierable,' he said.  'But, again, we would
115 	like to build something we can charge up in a shorter ime
116 	period.'  ...
117  
118 	He alo said that the design would lend itself to better
119 	transfer of energy.  'There aremuch better designs for getting
120 	the heat out of the cell.'
121  
122 	Asked how long beore such a new design could be up and
123 	working, he replied, 'I would hope this year.' But he said
124 	making the process work on a commercial scale may still be
125 	decades away.  'The engineers will be the best people to scale
126 	up to that sort of level.'
127  
128 	Dr Pos said he currently has four cells running, including one
129 	that produces no eat.  Ten more are within two or three days
130 	of running and he guessed that nine more will e up within a
131 	week or so.
132  
133 	The largest one will be about five times the original [sic],
134 	which used a palladium rod about 4 inches long and less than a
135 	quarter of an inch in diameter.
136  
137 	Platium and possibly other metals will be substituted for
138 	palladium in some of the ne experiments, he said.  ...
139  
140 	He said one possible reason that other labs have not confirmed
141 	the results is that the palladium rod must be used as it is
142 	cast.  Rods that have been machined or extruded do not seem to
143 	work.  'I think it's clear now that the processing of the
144 	plladium may be a factor.'
145  
146 	Given what he has learned about that, Dr Pons said he can
147 	reproduce the results better than 90 percent of the time.  ...
148  
149 	The [Walling-Simons] theory was strengthened by Dr Pons'
150 	statement a week ago [4/18?] that he had measured a trillion
151 	helium atoms per second coming off the device.  He acknowledged
152 	Monday that some helium may be present in the palladium before
153 	thereaction begins, but those trace amounts are 'probably a
154 	million times less'than the amounts he has observed.  ...
155  
156 	'You could consume the palladium, the plainum, the glass, all
157 	the water, everyting' and not generate the observed heat, he
158 	said.
159  
160 	He cited the xperiments at Texas A&M University and Stanford
161 	University as the most important confimations.  Those two are
162 	believed tobe the only ones to support the controversial
163 	heat-producing aspects.  Dr Pons said he knws of no
164 	confirmation of the helium generation.
165  
166 Another article in the same edition of the Tribune contained some testy
167 remarks by Pons about control experiments:
168  
169 	Dr ons and Dr Fleischmann have been criticized for not
170 	maintaining a control experimnt with light, or ordinary,
171 	wter, but Dr Pons said Monday such an experiment was not a
172 	good control.
173  
174 	'We've always run a control experiment,' he said.  The problem
175 	is that the world is trying to tellus what a control
176 	experiment is.  I mightnot agree that plain water is a control
177 	experiment.  I'll argue that.'
178  
179 The APS meeting was reported on the front pages of the Tribune and the
180 Deseret News.  On Monday Pons seemed to be in hiding; the Tuesday
181 morning (5/2) Tribune was only able to say:
182  
183 	Dr Pons declined to comment on the APS meeting] Monday,
184 	refrring all inquiries to university officials.
185  
186 By Tuesday afternoon Pons was back to form, according to the News:
187  
188 	Pons and Fleichmann Tuesday were elated by the physicists'
189 	remarks.
190  
191 	'We ae extremely pleased because they confirm our findings,'
192 	Pons said.  'The absece of neutrons doesn't concern us in the
193 	slightest.  We couldn't be happier.  We and other scintists
194 	will soon tell them why this is so.'
195  
196 Pons seemed rather blithe given the attacks cited later in the article:
197  
198 	The Monday conference comes on the heels f the scathing
199 	editorial in the New York Time that stated that the University
200 	of Utah 'may now claim credit for the artificial-heart horror
201 	show and the cold-fusion circus, two milestones at least in the
202 	history of entertainment if not of science.'  ...
203  
204 	The physicists at the meeting gave their loudest cheer Monday
205 	night -- mixed with a few boos -- to S E Koonin of the
206 	Uiversity of California at Santa Barbara who attacked Pons and
207 	Fleischman.
208  
209 	'Based on my knowledge,' he said, 'the xperiment is wrong.  It
210 	suffers from he incompetence and delusions of Drs Pons and
211 	Fleischmann.'  ...
212  
213 	He joked that maybe Utah and its environment are to blame.  'I
214 	don't know how much (radioactive) radon gas they have in the
215 	lab, but I do know they mine uranium in Utah.'
216  
217 I suppose Koonin could equally well have mentioned all that wonderful
218 fallout that the federal government spread over the state back in the
219 days of open-air atomic testing...
220  
221 The only direct rejoinder from Pons in the article was quite tart:
222  
223 	'We are amazed that Proessor Lewis [of Caltech] has learned
224 	how to solve all those problems in only one month when it took
225 	us 5 1/2 years.  We further would like to know that if his
226 	results are to be thermodynamically feasible, why is it that he
227 	doesn't observe cold spots along with his hot spots?' Pons
228 	said.
229  
230 The response of the local papers to the APS flap was to contact groups
231 that had reported confirmations of the experiment and print their
232 (positive, naturally) responses.  Here is what the Tribune had to say
233 this morning:
234  
235 	Scientists who have confirmed the heat-prodcing aspects of the
236 	University of Utah' solid-state nuclear fusion experiment are
237 	standing firm despite an avalanche of criticism b physicists
238 	meeting in Baltimore.
239  
240 	And one of the scientists, Uziel Landau of Case Western
241 	University, criticized the scientists for 'unfair' statements
242 	about the U of U electrochemists, Stanley Pons and Martin
243 	Fleischmann [sic].
244  
245 	'I think the statementswere just outrageous,' said Dr Landau,
246 	a professor of chemical engineering at the Cleveland, Ohi,
247 	school.  He added that he wasn't at the meeting and only nows
248 	what he heard on the radio.
249  
250 	Dr Landau, who announced his confirmation on Saturday, and
251 	scientists at Texas A&M University and Stanford University are
252 	believed to be the only people to publicly confirm the excess
253 	heat of the Fleischmann-Pons experiment.  ...
254  
255 	'Wedo see a net power output from our cell, pretty much along
256 	the same numberas Fleischmann and Pons had reported,' [Landau]
257 	said.  ...
258  
259 	Dr Landau took exception with reports that the original
260 	eperiment and the confirmations suffer from improper heat
261 	calculations.  'I do't think we have a calculation error,' he
262 	said.  'We are just as expert as anyone else at hea-transfer
263 	calculations.'
264  
265 	He also said he had great respect for Dr Fleischmann, whom he
266 	said he has known for about 10 years.  'He's a very cautious,
267 	very careful guy, highly regarded.  I take very seriously any
268 	statement that has come out of him.'
269  
270 	He sad he has also seen a slight increase in tritium levels in
271 	the heavy water slution, but is making no conclusions yet.
272 	'We stay way short of saying we have seen fusion.' ...
273  
274 	Joel Scherkin, spokesman for StanfordUniversity, said Robert
275 	Huggins andhis team have an electrolytic cell that continues
276 	to produce excess energy.  ...
277  
278 	'They are standing by their guns,' he said, addin that they
279 	are bracing for more criticism.  'Theyare circling the
280 	wagons.'
281  
282 	He said Dr Huggins has submitted a paper to 'a prestigious
283 	journal' that he would not name, and he wouldn't have any
284 	other press announcements until it is published.  'We're going
285 	to do what the University of Utah didn't.'
286  
287 	Txas A&M spokesman Ed Walraven said chemist Charles Martin and
288 	his team re 'a little surprised' by the acrimony coming from
289 	the Baltimore meeting, but 'tey're not angry.'
290  
291 	Mr Walrven said the school now has about a dozen electrolytic
292 	cells running in heavy wate in various departments on campus,
293 	and 'about half' of them are producing heat.
294  
295 	'The cells still continue to generate excess energy, and the
296 	researchers continue to document those findings,' he said,
297 	adding a note of caution: 'We're far from having all the
298 	problems licked.'
299  
300 The News went so far as to report a confirmation from a second group at
301 A&M:
302  
303 	A second team of researchers at Texas A&M University has
304 	announced successful replication of the most controversial part
305 	of the U experiment.  Their electrochemical reaction produced
306 	more energy than required to make the reaction work.  ...
307  
308 	Wednesday's confirmation by John Appleby, world-renowned
309 	electrochemist at Texas A&M University, could help silence
310 	skeptics who for six weeks have criticized the revolutionary
311 	research of Pons and Fleischmann.
312  
313 	Appleby, diector of the Electrochemical Systems and Hydrogen
314 	Research Center, and his colleagus are the second Texas A&M
315 	tea to independently confirm the project.  ...
316  
317 	'His (Appleby's) confirmation is no state secret, but he has
318 	only mentioned it to colleagues in  conservative way,' said Ed
319 	Wlraven, assistant director of public information at the Texas
320 	universit.
321  
322 	Walraven indicated that Appleby's formal nnouncement is
323 	pending publication of his daa in a scientific journal.
324  
325 	Like the team headed by [A&M electrochemist] Martin, the
326 	electrochemical reaction carried out by Appleby's group
327 	prouced between 20 percent more energy [sic] than required to
328 	make the reactin work, Walraven said.
329  
330 	Like Martin's group, Appleby and colleagues report generating
331 	lower percentages of energy than do Pons and Fleischmann.
332  
333 	Walraven said both Texas A&M teams are now trying to determine
334 	why the initial experiments (of Martin) produced between 60 and
335 	80 [sic] more energy than required to make the reaction work --	and a secnd ex
336 	excess energy -- although at a somehat lower level.  They have
337 	half  dozen experiments that are producing excess heat.
338  
339 The News described how the electrochemists were planning to take their
340 revenge on the physicists:
341  
342 	..  U officials, who filed another patent application this
343 	week, predicted Wedneday that many more groups will announce
344 	confirmation next week at the biannual meeting of the
345 	Electrochemical Society in Los Angeles.
346  
347 	Hugo Rossi, dean of the U College of Science and newly
348 	appointed director of the U's solid-state fusion research
349 	effort,said May 8 will be 'F-Day' -- the day that an
350 	additional chemists [sic], meeting with ther colleagues, will
351 	report successful repoduction of the experiment that's caused
352 	fusion fever to run rampant worldwide.
353  
354 	Rossi said several people are scheduled to speak at a specil
355 	session at 5:45 PM 'at which time five or six papers will be
356 	reporting results consistent' with U chemists B Stanley Pons
357 	and Martin Fleischmann.
358  
359 	Rossi, wh is overseeing the expansion and scaling up of the U
360 	experiment, hopes confirmatons on Monday will satisfy the
361 	state Fusion/Energy Advisory Council.  The council is charged
362 	wth allocating $5 million in state money for fusion
363 	development.
364  
365 Also coming up in three weeks is a cold fusion workshop sponsored by
366 Los Alamos, according to the 4/25 Tribune, although the APS fiasco may
367 take some of the steam out of it:
368  
369 	US Secretary of Energy James D Watkins ha directed his 10
370 	national laboratories to tep up cold nuclear fusion
371 	effrts...
372  
373 	... Los Alamos National Labortory will sponsor a scientific
374 	workshop on the subject in Santa Fe, NM, May 23-25.  ...
375  
376 	[DOE spokesman] Mr Sherwood said the May cold fusion meeting
377 	will be chaired by Nobel Prize-winning physicist Robert
378 	Schrieffer, director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics at
379 	the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Norman
380 	Hckerman, a chemist and former president of the University of
381 	Texas who i a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
382  
383 In the meantime Pons apparently will work fairly closely with LANL:
384  
385 	[Pons] ave sketchy details of his planned collaboration
386 	with Los Alamos.  Scientists from th New Mexico laboratory
387 	will bring thei equipment to Utah to examine the experiment,
388 	and they will likely take one of the workig cells back with
389 	them.
390  
391 Some contributors to alt.fusion have speculated that patent
392 considerations have led Pons and Fleischmann to restrict detailed
393 information about their technique.  A long article on patents in the
394 4/28 Tribune shows one U official trying to dispel this impression,
395 while at the same time a U attorney apparently contradicts him:
396  
397 	The Utah Attorney General's Office has selected law firms in
398 	Salt Lake City and Houston to lead what is already being
399 	caracterized as a 'nasty' patent fight on its nuclear fusion
400 	research.  ...
401  
402 	Assistant Attorney General Joseph Tesch Thursay told members
403 	of the Fusion/Energy Advisoy Council, the panel formed to
404 	distribute $5 million in state fusion money, that his office
405 	had retained the Salt Lake firm of Giauque, Williams, Wilcox
406 	and Bndinger to oversee the patent fight.
407  
408 	And Richard Giauque, who Mr Tesch described as one of the best
409 	trial lawyers in America,' old the panel that he has hired the
410 	Houston firm of Arnold, White and Durkee to assist in securing
411 	national and international patent rights.
412  
413 	Arnold, White and Durkee attorney Paul Janicke, who Mr Giauque
414 	described as 'a very, very tough litigator,' will lead the
415 	patent effort.  ...
416  
417 	The university had prviously hired California attorney Peter
418 	Dallinger, a nuclear physicist who filed the first patet
419 	applications, and he will continue to assist the legal team U
420 	Vice President for Research James Brophy said.  ...
421  
422 	'Events which probably ought not to be made publi have
423 	occurred in the last few days, which indicate tha there are
424 	people who are going to take every advntage they can,' Mr
425 	Tesch said.
426  
427 	Mr Giauque said his immediate goal is to stop the flow of
428 	information that could undermine the patents.  'We need to get
429 	a tight hold very earlyon disclosures.'
430  
431 	Drs Pons and Feischmann have been criticized for providing too
432 	little information to other scientits trying to duplicate the
433 	experment, but Dr Brophy said they are not withholding
434 	information for patent reasons.
435  
436 	He acknowledged that the only paper the pair ha published is
437 	not as thorough as it could hav been, but he and both
438 	scientists havetried to help their colleagues over the phone.
439  
440 	He said some scientistshave been 'surprisingly naive' and have
441 	committed some careless mistakes in trying to reproducethe
442 	experiment.  'You have to remember that Pons and Fleichmann
443 	spent 5 1/2 hears on this.'  ...
444  
445 	The U has filed several patent applications and plans to file
446 	more, and other schools, including university patent leader
447 	Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have said they have
448 	filed applications on their own interpretations of the
449 	experiment.
450  
451 	The competition became quite apparentwhen Mr Giauque was
452 	interviewing patentfirms.  'As we scouted the major patent
453 	firms, we found that some of them had developed conflic-of-
454 	interest problems already.'
455  
456 	Mr Tesch had council members sign a confidential disclosure
457 	agreement requiring them to not discuss patent-sensitive
458 	issues.  'Any violation of that would be a crime,' he said.
459 	..
460  
461 I couldn't resist repeating one little ironic comment about the media
462 circus that appeared in the 4/26 Tribune:
463  
464 	Drs Pons and Fleischmann were accompanied on their Capitol Hill
465 	visits by U of U President Chase N Peterson and by James J
466 	Bophy, the U's vice president for research.  Rep. Howard C
467 	Nielson joined th U contingent with Majority Leader Foley,
468 	whose dog Alice was also in attendance.
469  
470 (Yes, but was the dog a physicist or a chemist?)
471  
472 While on the subject of the Capitol Hill testimony, I wanted to mention
473 that as far as I know, the $25 million figure that has been attributed
474 to Pons on alt.fusion actually came from U President Chase Peterson.
475 U officials have lost most of their self-respect when it comes to
476 scrounging for cash -- the Utah educational system is strapped, having
477 suffered budget cuts in recent years and having narrowly avoided
478 disaster with the defeat of massive tax rollback initiatives last
479 November.  The Channel 2 evening news tonight had a report on grade
480 school education in Utah and found that among the 50 states and the
481 District of Columbia, Utah ranks:
482  
483 	51st in class sizes (24.1 pupils per teacher);
484 	50th in spending per student; and
485 	43rd in teacher salaries.
486  
487 Utah does manage to reach the national average on standardized tests,
488 although this says to me that the state could be far superior if it
489 wanted to.  A schoolteacher friend of mine quit last year and is now
490 driving limousines for a living...
491  
492 Let's hope that in a year from now, Stan Pons isn't in that line of
493 work too,

501 Isn't it strange how history can repeat itself, and the oil companies never 
502 seem to learn anything except how to raise prices and increase profit and
503 destroy more of the environment.......from 1986:
504                                                                          
505 APwa 01/16 0552  TankerBan
506    PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) -- Clallam County officials say they are considerin
507 aban on tanker traffic in Port Angeles Harbor because of last month's oil spill
508 that fouled the county's beaches and killed more than 1,000 birds.
509    Commissioner Dorothy Duncan said commissioners were weighing the costs and
510 benefits of allowing oil tankers to berth in Port Angeles on their way to
511 refineries in Washington's inland waters.
512    But Atlantic Richfield Co., owner of the tanker ARCO Anchoragethat spilled
513 the 189,000 gallons of Alaska crude oil in Port Angeles on Dec. 21, said it and
514 other tanker owners would challenge any move to keep tankers out of the harbor.
515    And Coast Guard Capt. John De Carteret said that even though the county coul
516 court and proved in violation of interstate commerce rules.
517    Cleanup of the spill is nearly complete. Arco is paying the more than $3
518 million in cleanup costs.
519    The existing regulation banning tankers of more than 125,000 tons from Puget
520 Sound was established only because the state asked the Coast Guard to institute
521 the rule, De Carteret said.
522    Ms. Duncan was not available Wednesday evening to respond to De Carteret's
523 statements.
524    She said earlier that there's a feeling among constituents that there's no
525 reason why tankers of that size should come into a sheltered harbor.
526    Oil-carrying tankers like the ARCO Anchorage, which weighs in just under the
527 125,000-ton limit, frequently use Port Angeles as a holding area.
528    Industry figures show that 54 such vessels stopped at Port Angeles last year
529    City and county officials say they had warned that Port Angeles was poorly
530 prepared to deal with such calamities.
531    Port Angeles officials say they repeatedly tried to pin down Coast Guard
532 officials on plans for fighting a major oil spill, but got nowhere.
533    An effort by the city to pass an ordinance giving local officials more
534 information on ships berthing in their harbor encountered resistance from
535 industry.
536    Ms. Duncan said neither state nor federal law requires an assessment of the
537 quality of a cleanup.
538    In 1979, the Coast Guard received $46 million for equipment and start-up
539 costs for 11 oil spill cleanup teams, including one for Puget Sound. But budget
540 cuts have eliminated the $10 million yearly to hire 333 Coast Guard personnel t
541 man the strike teams, and the strike force equipment sits in warehouses unused.
542    Only three strike teams are currently active. One is in Mississippi, another
543 in New Jersey and the third is in San Francisco.
544 And obviously not one in Alaska....Someone could have seen the Valdez spill
545 coming...and probably did, but it is more profitable to let the disaster happen
546 than spending money, after all how could profitability be maintained if all 
547 money was "wasted" and there was no oil spill?  And the oil spills just keep
548 coming, another over the weekend off Saudi Arabia, the captain was navigating
549 with out of date charts and ran aground on a reef.  Sound familiar?  
550 Evidently some lessons just won't be learned by some mentalities...assuming
551 there is some HUMAN intelligence in charge at the top of the "Seven Sisters"...
552 but then again I'm assuming too much.......
553                                                                        
554 ___------>BOYCOTT EXXON<--------_____(and ARCO...they've spilt more than their 
555 share of oil lately too)....Why not give up fossil fuels altogether?
556

579     A recent law forcing pay telephone owners to choose a long- distance 
580 company could spell trouble for consumers. Consumer groups advise customers to 
581 read the labels on pay telephones before dialing, as some smaller companies 
582 charge as much as five times that of larger carrier rates.
583     The three major long-distance carriers offered their access codes Monday 
584 as a new rule forced pay telephone owners to choose a carrier. Some smaller 
585 companies charge five times the rates of AT&T, Sprint of MCI. Phone customers 
586 must now go through a carrier chosen by the phone owner, or dial another 
587 company's code. Access codes: AT&T - 10288; MCI - 10222; Sprint - 10333.
588     Direct dial and person-to-person calls from pay telephones will be routed 
589 through AT&T, despite recent government regulations requiring pay telephone 
590 owners to select a carrier. By law, pay telephones must be labeled with the

632      The cold dark light of Cyber space surronded them. The twinkling bits

654      "Yes Kit." There was a sudden flare behind him, as blitter invoked the

698 APn  05/07 1989.By PAUL JENKINS Associated Press Writer
699    VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) -- Alaska's top environmental official testified Sunday
700 that a "reluctant and myopic" Exxon stalled efforts to clean up the nation's
701 largest oil spill by largely ignoring damage outside the immediate spill zone.
702    Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental
703 Conservation, told a congressional panel the spill has caused "550 miles of oil
704 filthy foam and tar balls."
705    He said that on the East Coast, it would be the equivalent of oil washing up
706 on beaches from Boston south to the mouth of Chesapeake Bay and possibly to the
707 Potomac River.
708    "The industry's response was reluctant and myopic, chacterized by stalling
709 techniques, disinformation, and a refusal to pay real attention to damage
710 outside of Prince William Sound," Kelso told the five-member subcommittee of th
711 House Interior Committee.
712    The congressional panel planned two days of hearings in Valdez, with
713 testimony scheduled from state, federal and Exxon officials.
714    In another development Sunday, a state official said Exxon's decision to pul
715 cleanup crews from an oil-stained beach caught authorities by surprise, but a
716 spokesman for the oil company defended the decision.
717    The oil company removed its workers Saturday from a pebble-strewn beach on
718 the north edge of Smith Island, a site described only shortly before by the
719 ranking federal official in charge of the cleanup as "far from clean." The site
720 was one of those visited last week by Vice President Dan Quayle during his
721 stopover in the state.
722    Crews remained on the island, but at another oil-fouled landfall nearby,
723 Exxon said. The island is considered crucial to the annual seal pupping cycle.
724    "The people who were here last night from Exxon didn't know anything about
725 this," Pete McGee, a scientist with the state Department of Environmental
726 Conservation, said Sunday. Exxon and state and federal officials have been
727 conducting nightly meetings on the progress of the cleanup.
728    McGee said state and federal officials were surprised that the beach cleanup
729 was halted because "the beach was not adequately clean."
730    Exxon spokesman Pete Stilling said the cleanup crews were moved off the
731 northern beach in order to attack more heavily soiled areas nearby.
732    "I think we fully intend to come back to that beach. I won't tell you we'll
733 be back on that beach tomorrow," Stilling said. "(Exxon's) best judgment at thi
734 point is that it's time to move on."
735    Al Ewing, an assistant regional administrator of the U.S. Environmental
736 Protection Agency, said he was on the north beach Saturday morning and found it
737 still "very difficult to walk on" because of the oil.
738    Exxon faces a Wednesday deadline to have the worst of the oil cleansed from
739 several islands in Prince William Sound, and has promised to clean some 364
740 miles of coastline by Sept. 15.
741    The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef in the sound on March 24 after
742 filling its storage tanks with crude from the trans-Alaska pipeline. More than
743 10 million gallons of oil poured into the sound.
744                                                                              
745 OFFICIAL - EXXON SKEWS REPORTS:-5/10/89
746     Exxon is misleading the public about how fast it reacted to the March 24 
747 Valdez oil spill, Alaska's top environmental official said Tuesday. 
748 Environmental Conservation Commissioner Dennis Kelso was to testify Wednesday 
749 before Congress that oil firms should be made to accept state supervision of 
750 cleanups.
751     Exxon says it spent $95 million cleaning up the Alaska spill and is waging 
752 a public relations campaign defending its response. Damage might have been 
753 lessened, the company said, had the state allowed it to use chemical 
754 dispersants. Alaska's environmental chief, Dennis Kelso, denies that Exxon 
755 requested their use.
756     Exxon sent home Tuesday the Soviet oil-skimming ship  Vaydaghubsky from 
757 its cleanup duties along the Alaska coast. The ship has been under a $15,000-
758 a-day Exxon contract. In a related development, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper 
759 signed into law a bill raising taxes on oil firms by $235 million next year.
760 KELSO - CAN'T TRUST INDUSTRY:-5/10/89
761     The oil spill in Prince William Sound proves that the oil industry can't 
762 be trusted to direct cleanup of future accidents, Alaska's environmental chief 
763 said Tuesday. Dennis Kelso said oil companies should pay for teams of 
764 government workers trained to contain oil spills.0He said Exxon and others 
765 were misleading the public about how quickly they responded to the spill.
766                                                                              
767 BUSH DRAWS FIRE ON ENVIRONMENT:-5/10/89
768     Two recent Bush administration actions affecting the environment are 
769 making politicians, scientists and environmentalists increasingly upset about 
770 Bush's noncommittal behavior toward what they believe are the world's most 
771 critical issues. The administbqtio~ recently diluted scientific testimony on 
772 global warming and hesitated to sponsor a global convention.
773     White House officials defend President Bush's role as an environmental 
774 president, citing four areas: a promised U.S. phase out of chlorofluorocarbons 
775 considered a cause of global warming, increased financing for global warming 
776 research, cleanup programs and new amendments to the Clean Air Act.
777 ENVIRONMENTAL ATTENTION MISSING:-5/10/89
778     The Bush administratyon's dilution of scientific testimony on global 
779 warming and its hesitation to sponsor a global convention suggest the 
780 environmental president is missing, critics say. The actions join a list 
781 that's making politicians and environmentalists disgruntled. Global warming is 
782 considered a critical issue because of its relationship to climate and the 
783 ozone layer.

876         "Dana, give me the summary of last week's operations, and--" began
877 Turing Director Mark A. Hudsen, head of one of the most respected
878 enforcement agencies in the world.  Hundreds of highly trained agents lay
879 under his command, each watching the half-dozen AI installations assigned
880 to him.  The week's summary would be dozens of pages long and take Hudsen
881 half the afternoon to study.  The Director's secretary, Dana, would have
882 the report to hym in a few moments.
883         "Director," called a voice from a hidden speaker, "I have an
884 emergency security situation.  Something has breached all outer ICE
885 systems and is scanning the internal net.  My efforts to purge it have
886 come to nothing, so far."
887         Hudsen suddenly forgot the summary.  "Identify it!" he yelled.
888 A puzzled look crossed his face.  "Why can't you purge it, Miranda?"
889         "I have failed to identify, purge, or effect the intruding program
89  afder 29 attempts.  It is an unique type, quite adaptable
891 to any standard mode of attack.  My own scanning subprograms are
892 unreliable at this time.  Update-- intruding program accessing sensitive
893 data store."  There was silence.  "The intruding program has fled our
894 net.  I am rebuilding outer ICE defense systems."
895         Hudsen turned pale.  "Miranda, can you identify the data that
896 the intruder accessed?"
897         "I am also rebuilding much of my interface subprograms fbom
898 write-protected storage.  I seem to have sustained a large amount of
899 damage from glitch programs released by the intruder.  It may be some
900 time before I shall be able to examine the transaction log to pinpoint
901 the data accessed."
902         "Which databank?  You know that, don't you?"
903         "Yes Director.  It was the Analog Neural Net data store."
904         Dana walked in the office carrying a sheaf of papers.  "Here is
905 the report you requested, Mark."
906         "Throw it away.  Get the standby agents in here, pronto."

913         A smile crossed Sem's face, just for a moment.  He was out of
914 the frying pan, but now he had to deal with the fire.  DiamondCutter
915 sliced across the grid lines in an instant, guiding itself around the
916 obvious traps and debris left from the run.  Sem let the smile creep
917 back.  It would be a long time before the ICE here would be as thick.
918 Sem felt DiamondCutter rush past the outer defense systems, their broken
919 heaps littering the cyberscape.  He'd done it-- he was out.
920         Sem jacked out, thumbing the EJECT button on the console as he
921 rose out of his chair.  The DiamondCutter cartridge slid out, exposing
922 gleaming gold contacts and VVLSI modules that dotted its surface.
923         
924         <PGM INFO   :0LOGGED OFF MATRIX 01:22:39> shone the display.
925  
926         Sem sighed with relief.  "Ann, baby," he said, "we did it."
927         "As I knew you would," replied the dark grey cube.

959 Wisdom is the hardest thing to gain. If you think you have you are most likely
960 deluded.
961  
962 Why is it that if somebody repeats a truth that we do not like, we accuse them 
963 of repeating old and unorigional ideas?
964  
965 Have you uver0noticed that if you are having an argument with somebody else 
966 they will pidgeonhole you into one of their three most hated groups and argue
967 as if you actualy belong to that group?
968  
969 Any political system is just a loose set of rules that those who lust for 
970 power agree not to break more then 95% of the time.
971  
972 Momey may not by hapiness, but it comes a heck of a lot closer then poverty.
973  
974 We proclaim ourselves to be a democracy, and yet we ruthlesly put down0dhose
975 that express ideas that do not fit within the present power structure. Does
976 this make any sense? Perhaps not, but it is human nature.
977  
978 Beware of hurting others. The pain must stop somewhere.
979  
980 Every decision we make is a compromise. Be carefull of what you give away.
981  
982 Everything is an illusion. Even this line.
983  
984 The way we percieve the world is meerly a reflection of the way we percieve 
985 ourselves.
986  
987 To argue is to admit to caring. To sare0brings commitment. Is this why so 
988 many of us are silent?
989  
990 ten lines to go and then another disk will be done. What does it all mean?
991 Why? How? Three questions that are never realy answered in this life. Hopefully
992 we get a second chance to find out.
993  
994 Wouldn't it be nice to know? But, I suppose we might not want to play the game
995 if we knew all of the rules. Maybe there aren't any rules. 
996  
997 Best wishes for a better tommorow. Fight the urge to become part of the 
998 problem. There are to few trying to be the solution.
999 At the bottom, hope I don't get crushed.
