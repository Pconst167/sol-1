 55 		The immortality machine.
 56 
 57     The computer hummed in the corner.  Its tone occasionally interupted 
 58 by the sounds of read and seek on the hard drive.  Will Savage and Art
 59 Coors were in the midst of a serious discussion.  The room was large, and 
 60 noisy, as machine rooms are wont to be.  
 61 
 62     "Look Will, it can be done.  We have the GIPS, and we have the software.
 63 All we need is a really detailed picture."
 64 
 65     "Hey, I'm not questioning the potential of your idea man.  I'm just
 66 questioning the wisdom of it."
 67 
 68     "Anything worth having is a risk.  Think about it for a minute.  Think
 69 of the potential applications.  Think of the MONEY!"
 70 
 71     "Yea, well you may be right."
 72 
 73     "Of course I'm right."
 74 
 75     "Sometimes I think you take the programer god complex to far Art."
 76 
 77     Art sighed in exasperation.  "Please don't give me the speach about 
 78 things man was never meant to know.  Screw the ludites and their silly
 79 superstions."
 80 
 81     "Even an idiot can have a point."
 82 
 83     "Ussually on the top of their pointy heads."
 84 
 85     "Sh*t, lets just get this over with.  How are you going to get the scan?"
 86 
 87     "Simple my friend, I'm going to ask.  I think I can even fit this under
 88 our grant.  The question is which of us gets to be the lucky winner?"
 89 
 90     "Its your idea, be my guest."
 91

123 Not the desicated work of the furriers art, tails of living vibrance.

177   The usual noises filled the cit streets.  George Jefries (Everyone called him
178 Jeff) walked down the street, searching for a job.  After over five years with 
179 the same company he was 'discharged' for one clerical error.  He knew, of corse
180 , the district manager had been after him since he was made D.M..  
181   Now he was a statistic, one of the 6.3% unemployed.  He hoped he wouldn't tur
182 out to be one of the 15% that would never be employed.
183   "Spare some change, mister?" a street person said.
184   "Pall, in about two weeks we'll probably be fighting over the same park bench
185 ." He said and walked on, looking for 'help wanted ' signs.  He stopped at a 
186 crosswalk and saw a young lady sitting in a folding chair.
187   "Draw your picture?"  She smiled, holding up her sketch pad and pencil. 
188 "Only two bucks."
189   "Sorry, don't have it..."
190   "Ok, for free then, common, have a seat." She pointed to the chair in front 
191 of her.  Jeff gave up and sat down.  He felt uncomfortable as she studied him. 
192 She turnde her attention to her pad and began to sketch.  Jeff began his study 
193 of her.  Her soft, red hair flowed down her back.  Mysterious green eyes 
194 flashed up from behind the sketch pad and her lips curled into a smile.
195   "So," She spoke, "what brings you to the city on this lovely summer morn'?"
196   "Work."
197   "Oh, how pleasant," She half frowned. "And what do you do?"
198   "Nothing, now  I got canned when I got to work this morning."
199   "How nice," she raised an eyebrow.
200   "Yes, and the district manager asked me if I'd work the rest of the day, dis-
201 pite being canned."
202   "and you said?"
203   "I do not say such things in front of a lady, but I assure you it was physi-
204 cally imposable..."
205   The girl began to laugh, but stopped sudenly.
206   "ok, on the way." She said as she stood up and dropped her sketch pad then 
207 jumped inot the air, landing infront of the bank across the street.

288 Mostly because of my wierd lyrics and Guitar only instrumentation.  I'm

355 An Unproud American: On The Iraq War's Outcome: A Dissenting View 
356 By Bill Sones Insight Features 
357  
358    For some time now I've had a sullen feeling in the pit of my stomach, a 
359 spiritless inwardness that won't go away, like I've swallowed a chunk of 
360 metal. 
361  
362    It took a while, but now I know what the matter is.  It's the Gulf war we 
363 just fought, if you can call it a war.  Yesterday, I picked up the New Yorker, 
364 March 11 issue, and there it was in the "Talk of the Town" section: the 
365 editors had likened the war to a massacre. 
366  
367    In the last days of the war, the magazine reported The Washington Post as 
368 saying, allied pilots "swarmed over Iraqi armor and truck columns, 
369 slaughtering the scattering vehicles by the score in a combat frenzy variously 
370 described as `a turkey shoot' and `shooting fish in a barrel.'" 
371  
372    The New Yorker editors recounted the figures: 25,000 to 100,000 Iraqi dead; 
373 89 Americans killed (that's anywhere from a 280-to-1 to a 120-to-one kill 
374 ratio).  This one-sidedness, they said, was reminiscent of historic battles 
375 that pitted the technological forces of one century against those of another, 
376 as when the Spaniards used guns and heavy armor to conquer Indian tribes armed 
377 only with lances. 
378  
379    Futilely and pathetically, the Iraqis aimed their antiquated anti-aircraft 
380 guns at the attacking U.S. aircraft, which dumped devastating "smart" bombs in 
381 return. 
382  
383    It was, on our part, a reign and rain of high-tech terror the likes of 
384 which the world hasn't seen for a spell, if ever. President Bush, playing to a 
385 willing national audience, never wavered, never relented, never slowed the 
386 pace.  Whether the first 5000 or 10,000 or 15,000 sorties (we flew close to 
387 100,000 in all) had taken the starch out of the Iraqi resolve, pushing them to 
388 the edge of surrender, our president had no intention of finding out. No 
389 lulls, no respites, no provisions for any face-saving on the part of the 
390 enemy, no olive-branch of apparent compromise. 
391  
392    Even a boxer, engaged in a furious fight , usually refuses to pummel a 
393 staggering, defenseless opponent into total senselessness. To press forward at 
394 such a moment would be tantamount to using the other boxer's face and head as 
395 a punching bag, tantamount to delivering a potential sentence of needless 
396 death. 
397  
398    Involved in such a fight, we Americans pressed forward, and then forward 
399 again. 
400  
401    Iraq as a nation and a people hit the canvas with a ghoulish, sickening 
402 thud.  Numerous cities and populated areas were hit by allied bombs.  Roads, 
403 factories, power plants, houses, occasional hospitals and schools, the entire 
404 infrastructure of a nation that was impoverished and backward to begin with 
405 were turned into rubble, into the fragments of a former civilization. 
406  
407    Thousands--and perhaps tens of thousands--of Iraqi soldiers were literally 
408 blasted into oblivion, buried under in trenches or bunkers that became, under 
409 Allied firepower, sudden mass graves with untold numbers of dead, their very 
410 names and identities lost in the ravages of war, left only to be guessed at by 
411 any surviving loved ones. 
412  
413    Back home, we watched all of this on television, with uncritical 
414 commentators mouthing euphemisms to cover up the true violence. Consider: 
415  
416    --We just fought an entire war without seeing riveting footage of a single 
417 soldier--either ours or theirs--in agonizing pain, with leg blown off or face 
418 mutilated by fire.  Yet perhaps as many as 100,000 soldiers died. 
419  
420    --We just fought an entire war without our population in general knowing 
421 one iota about the history and culture of Iraq or Kuwait, or who or what an 
422 emir is, or who in the heck Saddam Hussein might actually be, or caring about 
423 any of this. 
424  
425    --We just fought an entire war during which President Bush and our obliging 
426 media likened Saddam Hussein and his armies to Hitler and the Third Reich, yet 
427 no death camps were uncovered, Hussein never used the "chemical weapons" the 
428 media kept intimating that he might (though we freely used napalm), no 
429 Messerschmidtt-like planes plied the skies, no Iraqi scientists labored day 
430 and night on secrets of rocketry and atomic weaponry, no ultra-modern world-
431 class factories churned out materiel at a dizzying and frightening pace, and 
432 in short Iraq, a nation of 18 million people, fell hopelessly and helplessly--
433 more like the aforementioned punching bag than a real, vital enemy--into total 
434 destruction and disintegration in scarcely more than 40 nights and 40 days. 
435  
436    What a frightening object lesson of American arrogance and power to parade 
437 before the world in this era that was supposed to hold so much hope of peace 
438 and a new world order!  What a cheap and inexcusable way for President Bush to 
439 try to shore up his sagging popularity at home! 
440  
441    I am ashamed of myself and my country for allowing this to happen, spilling 
442 so much needless blood with such shameless glee. 
443  
444    I know there are others out there who feel the same way I do, millions of 
445 us good, patriotic Americans, though our voices have been ignored.  I know 
446 there are others who feel with me that for President Bush to come out of this 
447 war and then turn right around and talk about pressing harder for broader 
448 application of the death penalty at home borders on an obsession, a bloodlust 
449 macho-orientation of the man who was once labelled as a "wimp." 
450  
451    Will he never begin talking of anything affirmative, anything visionary, 
452 anything but this insatiable need for retaliation, violence, dying and death? 
453  
454    Once President Bush had talked of a kinder, gentler nation.  I didn't 
455 believe him then.  But for God's sake, I never expected this.

463 When I was in high school, people told me ;"America, love it or leave it."
464 This left me to wonder just who the hell they thought they were to imply I did 
465 not love my country.  I guess they thought this because I questioned the govern
466 ment, my parents didn't give me a Porche for my birthday, I didn't wear fancy 
467 cloths or because i didn't have a 'Why should I care, I'm rich' attitude.
468   I felt then, and still do feel, I am a better american, indeed a better perso
469 n because I am not blindly complacent.  I was against the war in Iraq.  Does 
470 that make me any les patreotic?  I guess it does... I will lay down my life 
471 for my country, but only if I believe in the cause....

482 frigging tin pot dictator has a flag.  Few have anything approaching the

495 being a woman myself. But all you passionate patriots out there can't deny
496 that we've also made some colossal mistakes with no one else to blame for em

509 I for one do not feel that this country is perfect.  I do a lot of criticizing,
510 and have been called names because of it in the past.  I like to think of my
511 self as a true patriot.  I believe in the constitution of the US, and the 
512 ideals it sets forth.  I don't give a flying f*ck for the flag, as it is just
513 a piece of cloth, and one that has been to ofteen used as the rallying point
514 for actions I am very much uncomfortable with.
515  
516 Many people do not care in the least about the true value of this country.  
517 They are just caught up in the macho bullshit that passes for patriotism 
518 these days.  (And largly always has alas.)

533 Actually I find flag burning rather atrocious as I find the flag more a symbol 
534 of the people and not our screwed-up (so called) leaders.  However, I would
535 rather see someone take a Zippo to it than see the First Lady (or Madona, for

537 It would take something extreme to caus me to 'light up', but I probably would

564 The symbol is th same, The hour was so tame, The fight that never came,
565 The song that still remains.
566 
567 There is a tower spreading shadows over me.  Seems that I'm the lonely
568 one, and that is such a pain.  But I know the answer.
569 
570 I had to tell them everything, I had to say the words.  I had to show that
571 my life could be different,  That I could tame the pain.
572  
573 The time it takes to say good-bye is very short indeed,  But when you
574 can't come back...  There is no reason to leave.
575 
576 			(Flow)
577 
578 The flow of time, the last good song, The terror of a night gone wrong.
579 
580 A powerfull message that flys through the night, And delivers its 
581 self with feelings of fright.
582 
583 A monster that eats us, and makes us so small, Like that story with 
584 Alice, But with a greater fall.
585  
586 (Don't know about this next one.  can't remember what I was thinking
587 at the time.)
588 
589 			(Tin)
590 The Tin man looks over me.  He watches my every move.
591 And in his own mechanical way, he makes sure I'm not 
592 alone.
593 
594 The Tin man cannot speak to me.  He cannot say a word.
595 Yet in his silence he speaks out, and I do not fear his
596 words.
597  
598 And Though he may be simple, without the slightest life,
599 There is still that within me that says he has his
600 value.
601  
602 Because he does not judge, Or hate or kill, or spew forth
603 an unkindness.
604 
605 (Just to prove that life is a cycle.)
606 
607 			(failure)
608 
609 Even though I've tried so hard, still I feel I've failed.  I didn't
610 go quite far enough.  My life may be derailed.
611 
612 And it seems I don't know how, to make it what I want.  Not the one
613 I thought I was.  
614 
615 Borrowed, stolen, Live I'm holding.  Terror, Pain,  My continuing 
616 refrain.

653 Screwed up and got cut off on my last message. 
654  
655 You have artificial inteligence.  Its sort of a cross between cyberpunk and
656 your standard grasp for immortality.  I believe that this sort of thing
657 will be possible within the next fifty years.  Yes, this would mean that
658 those who could afford it could 'live' on after their bodies died.   
659 Virtually forever.
660  
661 What is standing in the way of this happening?  Got me, I'm not a doctor,
662 so I don't know how detailed then can get in taking pictures of the
663 human body.  I do know a bit about computers, and I have to say that 
664 the 50 year estimate is fairly conservative.
665  
666 You wouldn't have to simulate all of reality all of the time.  For instance,
667 You are not always using your sense of smell, or your eyesight for that 
668 matter.  When 'people' aren't looking at something it doesn't need to
669 exist.  Yes, this enviornment makes existentialism look like a viable
670 philosophy.
671  
672 All sorts of interesting things could happen.  For instance, what would
673 a real world person thing of their simulated self?  What sorts of laws
674 would be brought into being?  Could these simulated people make a
675 living?  Would you have multiple copies running around?  If not, how
676 would you keep that from happening.  The Concept of self would undergo
677 a radical change.  Many people would not be able to handle the situation.
678 How would the simulations protect themselves?  
679  
680 What sorts of changes would be made in the physical laws of the simulated
681 universe?  Magic could be made to work of course, as could just about
682 anything else you wanted to allow.  What sort of privacy would the
683 simulations have?  Would this 'service' be available to all?
684  
685 Those are just a few ideas.  There is plenty of material for a novel
686 or two, but I just don't have the patiance or skill to go anywhere with
687 it.  I have far more detailed ideas for atleast another nine or 
688 ten books, plus a few short stories.  I don't think I'm ever going
689 to get around to writting them, so perhaps I'll outline them
690 here from time to time.  Maybe somebody will get an idea and actually
691 give these concepts some life.  A bit of credit for me would be
692 nice if that came about.  Atleast and autographed copy of the
693 book.  :-)

699 An article in today's paper was read to me early this morning saying you had
700 to have "proof of address" to buy alcoholic beverages anymore ... or was it
701 just downtown???  Maybe the APP is working overtime again and the undesirables
702 will have to wander to the lesser parts of NW R.I.P (tm) City or over to Union 
703 Avenue.  Certainly not anywhere near Daisy Kingdom.  BTW, I wonder how much it
704 cost the city to defoliate all the lower branches from all the shrubs so 
705 undesirables couldn't sleep there, to say nothing about the cost of disposing
706 of it all.

722 Styx: There were basically two sorts on BBSs back in the beginning,
723 the message based systems that CBBS initiated, and the scroll based
724 systems that BWMS initiated. BWMS originally was a data entry
725 machine that I dug out of the garbage and threw a modem on it. 
726 Since that time it sort of took on a life of its own. 
727 In 1986 BWMS was switched from the old data entry machine to a
728 Sanyo 555 MS-Dos machine.

749 This Image Cleanup is an interesting process.  Ain't it too bad there's only
750 one reporter covering the proceedings.  Finding the politics of this (and
751 Sunday's "what's wrong with this picture" picture) somewat frustrating, I
752 feel forced to burden the public with my own personal views.  (Besides, the
753 Board never seems to responds to written requests):
754 
755 1.  Mr. Graves reports tend to reflect an "overwhelming" support for con-
756 tracting out custodial services.  Not only does this not seem in the best
757 public interest (in fact rather dangerous) BUT the district should remain
758 accountable for who it places in the schools.  It's funny so many "tax-
759 payers" would bring this up at these not-too-well-attended sessions because
760 it IS something the district was planned for years.  The entire custodial
761 crew underwent intelligence testing just two years ago (probably similar to
762 the classification/reclassification/re-evaluation of reclassification pro-
763 cess classified staff went thru for years) and attended a number of training
764 sessions (in which test results were discussed/compared) ... at the same 
765 time they were being told they would likely be replaced by contracted labor
766 and handed a paper plaque stating "It's 10% what happens and 90% your re-
767 action" (...."don't be bitter when you're replaced???) ...
768 
769 In my opinion, next to the principal's ability to empower/inspire teachers,
770 the school custodian plays a considerable role in how the school functions,
771 the pride generated and how it is publicly perceived.  As somebody stated
059=Usr:322 Stray Cat         06/04/91 14:24  Msg:6163 Call:35376 Lines:67
772 earlier, contracted service agencies pay extremely low wages, offer few
773 benefits, have a high turnover rate, and can't engender the allegiance that
774 someone who feels "connected" can.  Besides, a local college who did this
775 encountered so many hassles that after going through at least two companies
776 ended up rehiring their own crews again.  These kinds of interruptions 
777 could drastically influence school morale and the district at large.   
778 
779 But I also think this attitude shows a disturbing lack of appreciation for 
780 the tremendous responsibilities of the custodians and a similar disrespect
781 fr kitchen workers/other classified staff sets a HORRIBLE example for
782 children.
783 
784 2.  Bill also reports considerable curriculum bashing (as always).  It
785 would seem to me that CURRICULUM and PRINCIPALS/TEACHERS **ARE** the school
786 distict and as it now stands, the function of the curriculum departament is
787 diluted/dispersed by interference from too many special interests/levels
788 of bureaucracy ... including the Board.  Not only have they been endlessly
789 tampered with through constant reorganization campaigns during budgeting
790 upheavals, but they have never really been empowered to make the decisions
791 necessary for constancy in curriculum policy.  CD&S personnel not only 
792 incorporate the widest range of expertise and teaching experience of any
793 managerial department in the district, but have administrative certifica-
794 tion as well.  It would seem that an empowered, CENTRALIZED Curriculum/
795 CD&S/Research department, accountable to school principals accountable to
796 teachers, would be the glue Norma Paulus' department says is needed for a
797 cohesive, consistent, district-wide curriculum.  If Curr/CD&S were placed
798 directly against Operations/Deputy Supt. in the budget and other decision-
799 making processes, the Board might get more accurate information on which 
800 to base their decisions (an upfront accounting system and outside auditing/
801 mediating might also be helpful).
802 
803 3.  Because of expense/condidentiality, I think the evaluating/testing
804 function SHOULD be subcontracted.  In any case. Asst. Supt. status for
805 the director seems over-inflated.  Just a guess from overheard hearsay,
806 but proper credit for the nationally and DOE-acclaimed computer program
807 might be overdue.
808 
809 4. Statements of being a world-class institution should be curtailed,
810 not oly because of being misleading, but because of the possible
811 perception that we have solen from needier district to maintain the
812 status.
813 
814 5.  I would beware of the "questionnaire" approach to district reform.
815 From past experience results can seem tailored to certain desired out-
816 comes.  And weren't we all a little disturbed by the outcomes of all
817 those wierd war polls (geesh, I HOPE so!)?
818 
819 6.  I hope the PORTLAND/SCHOOLS section in the Oregonian will feature
820 mre information on nation and local reforms and that current reports
821 on problems will be followed up with forums on textbook issues/teach-
822 ing methods/whatever and features on those local programs reportedly
823 WORKING (like the ones at Marshall and Benson), given credit where it
824 is due.  If articles were more personalized and descriptive and
825 emphasized the dedication of those individuals who have most probably
826 spent hundreds of hours of their own time developing/implementing these
827 programs, it might make for better "connections" between the schools 
828 and the public.
829 
830 7.  Not included in Bill's "reports" but stated/implied (inferred?) 
831 elsewhere (including the Oregonian's "Stacked Deck" article), I think
832 the boundaries for board representation and the voting process use4d
833 should be re-evaluated, that members should be re-elected every TWO 
834 years instead of four (despite the expense), and that strict limits
835 should be placed on campaign contributions/expenses.
836 
837 Sorry if this sounds overbearing, presumptuous, vindictive, etc., etc.

840 Got to disagree with some of what you say.  On the subject of the curiculam
841 department, as far as I can tell they have been given the authority to do
842 whatever they want.  And guess what?  We've gone through three major 
843 curiculum changes in reading in the last six years.  They have eliminated
844 Language usage from the curiculam, and as I understand it, spelling is alwo
845 right out the door.  The math curiculam on the other hand has remained 
846 fairly constant over the last ten years, and external test results are
847 showing portland achievment in this area to be amount the best in the
848 country.
849  
850 I fully agree with what you say about custodial staff.  PSU went through
851 hell a few years ago after going to contracted help.
852  
853 On the subject of testing and evaluation, I must disagree.  There is at
854 this time an external entity doing yearly testing, the state of
855 oregon does testing in the 3rd 5th and 8th grades (I believe this is
856 correct.)  State wide norms and performance levels will be available
857 next month.  The in district testing is amoung the best and most 
858 inovative in the country.  (Yes, I have reason for HEAVY bias,
859 as I work in the research and evaluation department as a programer
860 on their computerized adaptive testing system, amoung other things.)

904 ---------------------------------A Stitch in Time --------------------------
905 
906 Here I am again <grinnnnnn> ... bet you've all been waiting w/baited breath
907 for another tirade!  Believe or not, even though I HATE doing it, venting
908 my frustrations seems to make me feel soooooOOOOoooooo must better, so hope
909 you'll just "bare" with me.
910 
911 1.  The FIRST thing I think PPS should do is implement CONFLICT RESOLUTION
912 sessions with all personnel (starting with That deparament, with [MOST] dis-
913 trict administrations second, then the employee unions).  I've just gone
914 thru a 10-yr ordeal that MIGHT make a classic film on what may be wrong w/
915 the entire universe <GRIN> (and I DON'T exclude myself as part of the prob-
916 lem BTW).
917 
918 2.  After the entire distrdict has gone thru CR therapy, write new vision
919 statements (to correlate w/the social studies core curriculum, if that's
920 what's actually being "taught").  The Board also ought to revision their
921 mission statement; it sounds too legalistic, like maybe they rely too heav-
922 ily on evaluation department reports.  The district credt, "It's 10% what
923 happens and 90% your reaction," should either be explained more fully or
924 changed to something like "We are developing *PEOPLE*" (that was on one of
925 my yearly evaluations and, although I was quite steamed about it at the time,
926 in hindsight is actually very beautiful).
927 
928 3.  Concentrate efforts on STAFF DEVELOPMENT. Although I resent those "free
929 trips" for executives/politicians, I dn't think it's quite the same for
930 teachers ... educational seminars for those who teach are probably broaden-
931 ing, inspirational and keeps them up to date.  Maybe if channels of commun-
932 icaton were improved in the district, teachers would need to attend fewer
933 committee meetings and that needed time out of the classroom could be put to
934 better use.  Because they ar requred to maintain certification thru continu-
935 ous re-education ON THEIR OWN TIME (to say nothing of the time spent develop-
936 ing lesson plans/correcting papers at home), it would seem they are more 
937 deserving that [most] administrators of this privelege.
938 
939 4.  I think PUBLIC INFORMATION should work with teachers/principal/curricu-
940 lum to dispel the possible public misconception that teachers are glorified
941 babysitters.  IF PI *is* responsible for preparing those horribly dry media
942 statements about the schools (sometimes amounting to little more than lists), 
943 I think they should try to create more warmth and connectedness.  If people 
944 oly KNEW the amount of personal time/effort (to say nothing of the headaches/
945 heartaches) that go into programs like DBAE ... or that teachers went thru
946 extensive training/private studying  AND developed new lesson plans mostly
947 ON THEIR OWN TIME), a whole different view of school programs might be seen.
948 Maybe videotaping special programs/conferences/curriculum specialists for
949 cable access would be helpful.  I'd love to see a DBAE or conflict resolu-
950 tion lession ... maybe even MATH.
951 
952 5.  I hate to even MENTION it, but I feel strong policies should be developed
953 on abuse/harrassment issues.  Teachers are put at a terrible disadvantage if
954 their sponttaeneity is blocked and "sterile" environments are horrible for
955 kids.  And like the City of Portland, "harrassment" seminars should be held
956 for all employees (Dick Bogel should get a "grace under pressure" award for
957 that).  Thee again, if there were good channels of communication in the
958 district, these things MIGHT not happen.
959 
960 6.  Perhaps, for awhile anyway, a RUMOR CONTROL hotline or SUGGESTION box 
961 should be installeed and a public "notebook" of comments maintained for em-
962 poloyees to read and re-submit those suggestions with which they agree.  Or 
963 maybe a "private"  PPS BBS "wailing wall" ...
964 
965 7.	The idea of being able to "bankroll" funding sounds WONDERFUL!!! If
966 that's impossible (but why SHOULD it???), at least let the departmet choose
967 WHERE it will be contributed/"used" (like the health clinics, ECE, MCME, etc)
968 I always had the horrible feeling that all the extras when to evaluation for
969 more computers (I'm a brken record on his ... sorry).
970 
971 8. Figure out better ways of dealig with PARENT INVOLVEMENT.  Many house-
972 holds with two working parents have little time for public/PTA meetings. 
973 And input based primarily on [nonexistent?] PPS reports or Jeff/Julie's
974 somewhat slanted reports (does 1st Interstate **OWN** KATU or what??) don't 
975 seem to present an adequate overview or perceptions/perspective (polls/
976 surveys again ... and my own prejudices/opinions).
977 
978 9.  I think the EXPENSE and authority for School Police should be transferred
979 to the City.  This is not to cast **ANY** dispersons on School Police; it's
980 just that people using terminology like "axing the fisfits" maintaining 
981 theiri "own" police deprtment makes me VERY nervous (and that might also
982 reflect on some other problems as well).
983 
984 10.  Write procedures manuals for EVERYTHING people are REQUIRED/SHOULD know,
985 making them accessible also on computer (AND written in English not legaleeze)
986 Information SHARING (NOT hoarding/hiding) should become a top priority.  Sane
987 computer policies (adequate hardware/usable software/backup and subdirectory
988 GUIDElines) are also badly needed.  OF COURSE, this should be thoroughly 
989 discussed with those that USE computers first!  (oooops, getting dogmatic
990 again ... sorry).
991 
992 11.  As the largest employer in Oregon, PPS should keep in mind they are
993 not only setting an example of proper conduct under the constraints of Bal-
994 lot Measure #5 (keeping in mind their own credo) but that their actions
995 will ultimately reflect on what/how they are teaching children.
