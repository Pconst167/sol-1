22                                 HOW IT HAPPENED
23                                 by Issac Asimov
24 
25 
26    My brother began to dictate in his best oratorical style, the one which
27 has the tribes hanging on his words.
28    "In the beginning," he said, "exactly fifteen point two billion years
29 ago, there was a big bang and the Universe--"
30    But I had stopped writing.  "Fifteen billion years ago?" I said incred-
31 ulously.
32    "Absolutely." he said.  "I'm inspired."
33    "I don't question your inspiration," I said.  (I had better not.  He's
34 three years younger than I am, but I don't try questioning his inspiration.
35 Neither does anyone else or there's hell to pay.)  "But are you going to
36 tell the story of Creation over a period of fifteen billion years?"
37    "I have to," said my brother.  "That's how long it took.  I have it all
38 in here," he tapped his forehead, "and it's on the very highest authority."
39    By now I had put down my stylus.  "Do you know the price of papyrus?" I
40 said.
41    "What?"  (He may be inspired but I frequently noticed that the inspira-
42 tion didn't include such sordid matters as the price of papyrus.)
43    I said, "Suppose you describe one million years of events to each roll of
44 papyrus.  That means you'll have to fill fifteen thousand rolls.  You'll
45 have to talk long enough to fill them and you know that you begin to stammer
46 after a while.  I'll have to write enough to fill them and my fingers will
47 fall off.  And even if we can afford all that papyrus and you have the voice
48 and I have the strength, who's going to copy it?  We've got to have a guar-
49 antee of a hundred copies before we can publish and without that where will
50 we get royalties from?"
51    My brother thought awhile.  He said, "You think I ought to cut it down?"
52    "Way down," I said, "if you expect to reach the public."
53    "How about a hundred years?" he said.
54    "How about six days?" I said.
55    "He said, horrified, "You can't squeeze Creation into six days."
56    I said, "This is all the papyrus I have.  What do YOU think?"
57    "Oh, well," he said, and began to dictate again, "In the beginning --
58 Does it have to be six days, Aaron?"
59    "I said, firmly, "Six days, Moses."

64 - I've read everyone's opinions as to where or what if a god  -
65 - existed. I've decided to throw in my 2 bits. This is        -
66 - ENTIRELY an opinion. One thing about religion is that when  -
67 - it is being "discussed", it soon becomes a big argument. I  -
68 - don't want it to get that way:			      -
69 - I for one do NOT believe in any sort of god or supernatural -
70 - creator for a few reasons: Where did HE/SHE come from? He   -
71 - couldn't just have been created out of NOTHING and I don'T  -
72 - buy him "being there from eternity" because someone HAD to  -
73 - start it. But how? If the god is demanding of his followers -
74 - why doesn't he come down to earth in a 3-dimensional being  -
75 - and expalin what he wants done? There is NO PROOF of ANY god-
76 - existing in the entire multiverses. 		-
77 - I do not believe in Heaven or Hell. No "SIN" could be bad   -
78 - enough to send you to hell for eternity. Even if you killed -
79 - 10000 people in your time, that would mean that you were a  -
80 - "Mental Case", and as religion goes, god created man. So,   -
81 - God created a mistake! God's mistakes shouldn't be punished -
82 - That would be like if I made a program that didn'T work     -
83 - correctly that I would take it apart bit-by-bit and keep    -
84 - doing it until there was nothing left.  		      -
85 - The Bible's "666" I don'T believe in either. The bible said -
86 - that the second coming of Jesus would happen sometime in    -
87 - the 20th century. God has only 16 years left to go!         -
88 - I do not believe in prayer either. If God is so powerful and-
89 - extremely perfect, he would be able to read our thoughts and-
90 - act accordingly. As you can see, My outline in religion is  -
91 - mainly my own beliefs and disbelief in someone "greater"    -
92 - than we are. The above is MY opinion and I do NOT claim it  -
93 - as a "FACT". Another thing to add to "mistakes" above, GOD  -
94 - Doesn'T make mistakes, am I right? If you are interested in -
95 - talking (not arguing) about the above, leave a message and  -
96 - I'll be glad to discuss it.					-

125 Mike, I agree with much of your plea for good language in front
126 of children, but you underestimate your public. I someone has
127 grown up enough to use this thing, he (she?, it??) is old enough
128 to understand a few 4 letter words. If he hasn't seen any yet,
129 maybe it will be educational. They are, after all everywhere.
130 But then this is no excuse to use them.
131 
132 Rex, and others questioning creation: making something out of
133 nothing is easy, we do it all the time, when we create an idea,
134 a story, a sentence, a thought. All God must do is make the stor
135 y a little "harder". The fact of creation is not testable within
136 the created world. Can a computer program test to see if it is
137 a program? When you dream do you know you are dreaming?
138 Sometimes, not always.
139 
140 Yes, the Bible says " in My Father's house are many rooms."
141 This does not say there are many ways to get there, only that
142 there is many rooms (perhaps room for many people) The Bible
143 does say that there is only one way to heaven; Jesus himself.
144 If the Bible is true, it is not interpretable, it can say
145 only one thing. 
146 Again, a challenge to those who claim the Bible is the source
147 of all religious truth: who chose the present contents of the
148 Bible, and rejected the rather large remainder of similar 
149 writings? And why? The so called apochrypha are part of some
150 Bibles, and not of others. Who is correct and why? There is
151 much more, much has been lost. Would a newly rediscovered
152 gospel become part of the Bible?
153 
154 Back to creation: time makes our world 4 dimensional, in a 
155 five dimensional world the concept of 'before might have no
156 meaning, any more than the start or end of a line segment 
157 bent into a circle. (Which has no end, but a finite length.)
158 We cannot test for something outside our reality, only take
159 it on faith, or take on faith that it isn't.

161 To the man in grey (no caps.)
162       I was not aware that there was an age limit fothis
163 board. Horrors!! Was I wrong all this time ?!?  young
164 to speak up ?  What is your age limit ?
165       Is it also true that you must have a computodema
166 certain value before you are allowed to speak t Boys' ?
167 If so, please let me know and if I don't qualify Icourse,
168 rush right out and invest in a grown-ups system.

171       Is there any proof that God does not exist ?

189 THE POINT I AM TRYING TO MAKE ABOUT LANGUAGE, IS NOT THAT
190 PEOPLE OF ALL AGES HEAR (OR READ) THEM, BUT RATHER THE
191 TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS BEING SAID WHEN THEY ARE USED
192 MOST TEENAGERS (INCLUDING ME WHEN I WAS OF THAT AGE) LIKE
193 TO USE STRONG LANGAUGE FOR ITS SHOCK VALUE. IT GETS THEM
194 NOTICED BY BRINGING ATTENTION TO THEM. WHAT THEY DON'T 
195 REALIZE IS THAT IT IS A NEGATIVE ATTENTION. YET TYPICALLY
196 THEY ARE SO STARVED FOR ANY KIND AT ALL, THEY DON'T CARE,
197 AND DON'T EVEN TAKE IT INTO CONSIDERATION. CHILDREN DO
198 LEARN BY EXAMPLE, AND IF THE USE OF FOUL LANGUAGE IS
199 ALLOWED TO PROPAGATE WITHOUT RESTRAINT, THEY WILL AND DO
200 PICK UP THE USAGE. THE UNDER TEEN YEAR TYPES ARE EVEN LESS
201 AWARE OF THE TRUE VALUE AND MEANING BEHIND THE WORDS THEY 
202 SPEAK, TO THE VERY YOUNG IT IS NOTHING MORE THEN A NEW WORD
203 THEY HAVE LEARNED WITH NO REAL MEANING AT ALL. 
204 JUST AS EVERY CHILD AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER HAS GONE OUT AND
205 PLAYED IN THE STREET, I WOULDN'T ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO SO, 
206 NIETHER WOULD I ENCOURAGE THEM TO USE LANGAUGE THAT THEY DO 
207 NOT FULLY UNDERSTAND. YES, IT DOES HAVE SHOCK VALUE (AND
208 INDEED I HAVE USED IT MYSELF FOR THAT VERY PURPOSE), BUT
209 UNTIL A PERSON IS MATURE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT 
210 YOU SAY MEANS MORE THEN THE MEANING BEHIND THE WORDS YOU
211 SPEAK, THAT IT ALSO TELLS THE WORLD WHAT KIND OF PERSON YOU 
212 ARE, I FEEL THAT A RESTRICTION OF SOME SORT IS NEEDED.
213 YES, I USE THE LANGAUGE MYSELF IF THE SITUATION IS SUCH THAT 
214 I FIND IT APROPRIATE, BUT I AM ALSO QUITE AWARE OF THE
215 RFLECTION IT PUTS ON ME IN THE PROCESS, AND IN THE CASE
216 OF BWMS THE IMPRESSION PEOPLE HAVE OF THE SYSTEM.
217 THIS IS WHY I FEEL THE WAY I DO, NOT BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLE
218 SMATERING OF FOUR LETTERS THROWN ACROSS THE SCREEN, IT
219 IS ALL THE IMPLICATIONS AND ATTITUDES THAT THOSE WORDS
220 REPRESENT THAT I AM CONCERNED WITH.

223 Creating something from nothing is not possible.
224 nNeither is making nothhing out of something.
225 
226 When you create a sentence, you make it from
227 words, letters and many other things.
228 An idea comes from electric pulsed in the
229 brain.  Any one else want to try and
230 prove that something can be created
231 from nothing?
232 
233 
234 My knowledg of computers was not created from nothing.
235 IT WAS CREATED WITH THE HELP OF A LOWLY, CHEEP, KIDDY MACHINE>
236 YES, A VIC-20.  Yet for some reason
237 I know more about
238 computers than most of my friends that own
239 hundred of dollars more.
240 I SUPPOSE that the MAN IN GRAY teaches advanced computer 
241 intelligenc at a major college.  And owns a multi-zillion
242 dollar machine.
243 
244 I am not saying that the VIC-20 can keep
245 pace with the more expensive machines
246 but a computer is only as good as the user.
247 You can put down my kiddy machine person in gray, but I'M
248 A VERY HAPPY VIC-20 OWNER!

253 Cistop Mikey: I think you've got it all wrong, saying that the use of "dirty" words should be limited for reasons 
254 of insufficient maturity on the part of the audience. They should be limited because overuse takes away from their
255 power. Violent words have their place in our language, as appropriate markers of severe emphasis. Overuse dilutes
256 their ability to provide this emphasis, leaving us without a verbal "safety valve" in times of stress, just as if
257 you were to put hot pepper in all your food you would soon cease tasting it entirely.

261   Dear Abby:
262       I enjoy frequenting a trans-reality inn when time allows. It is by
263 and large a pleasant place, and oft one can find stories and excellent
264 debate at this inn. But as of late people are acting strangely. People
265 who have impressed me with their rationality are throwing the cheapest
266 shots imaginable. Are the russians beaming us like my uncle says?

277   Enough discussion.....It's religious joke time!!!! (yah...flags waving behind    hill)
278 
279    Two rabbis are out walking one day, when one says to the other, "I have
280 a big problem.  My son has just converted to Cristianity."
281    "Yes," says the other rabbi, "So has my son."
282    So they discuss it for a while and finally decide to consult the Lord
283 on this matter.  They go to the tallest mountain they can find and meditate
284 at the top for several days.  Suddenly, the clouds part, and a hollow
285 voice booms out, "Yes."
286    The rabbis answer, "Sir, It's our sons, they have converted to
287 Cristianity."
288    A pause, then the voice booms again, "Don't worry, I have the same
289 problem."
290 
291   It's over...(YAHHH!!!...People dancing, singing), but look for more.

299 The piper sat at the oaken table, scarred by long usage, staring at his new
300 companions.  The gentleman who called himself the mad actor (was there really
301 a hint of madness behind thos eyes?), a lady named Lynn, and a man in grey
302 called Greymalkin -- a strange group, but not one to go out of one's way to
303 avoid.  The scent was there for adventure.  A pulse pounded in the sidee of
304 his throat as he replied:
305 
306 "I for one am interested in learning more of what you have in mind.  However,
307 you must not mistake my willingness to listen for aquescence to your wishes.
308 For suitable rewards, men can be found to face most dangers, however -- there
309 are situations that cause me to behave like an arrant coward, and rather than
310 embarass myself in front of this company, I would decline to place myself in
311 those situations."

340 	An interesting concept, Deborah.  Are you then saying that something that
341 is invisible to your senses can logically constitute nothing?  Consider your
342 example of gravity: like gravity, your existance has an effect upon me, but
343 you personally are invisible to me.  Does that mean that you are nothing?
344 By your definition it would, but I think that you might not agree.  But I
345 don't agree with the statement that "something cannot be created from
346 nothing" unless it is qualified with the statement "according to currently
347 accepted laws of thermodynamics."

349 Gary:	Why add a laser or atomic missiles when you already have the mass
350 driver? If you don't get what I mean read Heinlein's "The Moon Is a Harsh 
351 Mistress". I don't remember the exact figures, but 100 tonnes of rock
352 launched from Luna to Terra will cause an explosion on impact equal to
353 several HUNDRED kilotons. And NO radiation!
354 
355 	As for the "something from nothing people", Asimov once did an essay
356 "showing" how all you need is the laws of physics. An "empty" universe 
357 will not be empty long! (Actually, how do you measure time in an empty
358 universe?)

407 One last adress at something from nothing: All matter and energy is made
408 from the same "stuff." We have already figured out how most energy fits
409 into this model. Even gravity has a particle aspect. (the graviton) You
410 can never actually create matter or energy, just change its form. It's a
411 basic theory that all matter and energy are conserved.

414 \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \_/ \
415      About the matter=energy concept.  If you ever played around with
416 the matter wavelenth equation, the energy frequency equation and use a
417 mass of "m", and assume photons conform to the matterwave theory.  I
418 used these equations and found out the energy to create a photon on m mass.
419 you have to mass times speed of light squared.  Or more formiliarly,
420 E=mc^2.
421      I have heard that electromagnetic waves are a disturbance.  If so,
422 a disturbance in what, a vast pool of energy, push photons in one end,
423 and get other ones displaced at the other end.  If they travel by
424 compression, like sound waves in air, they should have a certain speed
425 such as the speed of sound, but called the speed of light.  This would
426 explain why you can't travel over the speed of light, an "electromagnetic"
427 boom, distroying matter.  But you can bypass this by steamlining the
428 ship electromagneticly.
429                             (A pause whilst I gather breath)
430      Tell me more about gravity waves.

434 - Something can't be created from nothing... and I can prove  -
435 - it. A thought... something we have LEARNED. We can't imagine-
436 - something or put something together unless we KNEW what it  -
437 - was before we put it together! If you took a newborn baby   -
438 - and left him in a dark room for 30 years and suddenly       -
439 - exposed him, he wouldn't know what to do or how to act. You -
440 - can't "THINK" up a story... you only piece experiences      -
441 - together that you've had or dreamed about in your life.     -

448 MIKEY: I AGREE WITH YOU IN PRACTICE, AND I LIKE A POINT YOU MADE- NAMELY
449 THAT A WORD MEANS WHAT YOU WANT IT TO MEAN.  EXAMPLE
450 
451 BITCH: A FEMALE DOG
452 BUTT: THE END OF A RIFLE
453 ASS: A QUADROPED SIMILAR TO A DONKEY
454 
455 AS YOU SEE, WORDS MEAN WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO.
456 P.S. "LOVE" IS A FOUR LETTER WORD
457 
458 
459 ALL THIS SOMETHING FROM NOTHING STUFF! WHY MUST GOD GO BY THE RULES OF 
460 OUR UNIVERSE?
461 RECIPE FOR A UNIVERSE:
462 (1) INFINITE VACUUM
463 (1) ALTERNATE REALITY
464 TAKE 1 TEASPOON OF MATTER FROM THE ALTERNATE REALITY AND PUT IT IN THE 
465 VACCUM. CREATE NEW PHYSICAL LAWS. AND PRESTO! A NEW UNIVERSE!
466 
467 GOD DOES NOT HAVE TO EXIST IN OUR(OR YOUR) REALITY, SO IT IS NOT SUBJECT
468 TO THE LAWS OF THE PLACE. READ "THE GODS THEMSELVES" BY ASIMOV FOR A
469 REFERENCE ON WHAT I MEAN.
470 
471 ON RELIGION- A RECENT "TOWN HALL" DISCUSSION. WHICH IS SUPREME:
472 THE FREEDOM OF RELIGION OR THE RIGHTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL.
473 A YOUNG CHILD WAS BEATEN TO DEATH BY HIS MOTHER, BEACUSE THE RELIGION 
474 DEMANDED THAN PHYSICAL PUNISHMENT WAS THE WILL OF GOD. A PERSON IS DEAD.
475 HE HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER. UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, THIS WOULD
476 BE 'MURDER MOST FOUL'. BECAUSE IT WAS DUE TO RELIGION, PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING
477 THAT THE STATE CAN'T INTERFERE(IE PRESS CHARGES).
478 THIS CANNOT BE RIGHT! (OR CAN IT)?
479                                                         JONATHAN CHANCE

481 
482   I, like Evan, have a IIe with a hayes modem.
483  Unfortunately I have a kiddy mind.
484  P.S. The lead undies are great, but I have serious doubts about my 
485       ability to procreate.....
486                                                 Mr. Tim
487 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
488 DIG FOR THIS; RECURSIVE IS NOT A WORD. AT LEAST NOT IN ANY OF MY DIC-
489 TIONARIES.
490 SOMEONE MADE A SEMI-VALID POINT ABOUT EXISTANCE EARLIER. I DO EXIST. BUT
491 ONLY IF I RESPOND. IF I SAY NOTHING.................
492 AS TO THE LANGUAGE DISCUSSION....SOME OF US DO NOT HAVE TO RESORT TO 
493 PROFANITY TO EXPRESS OURSELVES. ESPECIALLY SINCE NONE OF THOSE WORDS 
494 EXPRESS INTELIGENCE,IDEAS, OR OPINIONS TO AN UNDERSTANDABLE DEGREE. I
495 PERSONALLY FIND NO USE FOR THEM,BECAUSE THEY ARE UNNECESSARY. I CAN BE
496 AGITATED AND COMMUNICATE WITHOUT THEM, AND SO CAN AT LEAST 3/4 OF THE
497 PEOPLE  I AM ACQUAINTED WITH. AND YET BE VERY EFFECTIVE. I HAVEN'T
498 BEEN A YOUTH FOR ALMOST ...............TEENAGE WISE ANYHEY.........
499 FOR OVER A DECADE, AND I STILL FIND PROFANITY OFFENSIVE, THO I, TOO
500 WENT THROUGH THE EXPERIMENTAL STAGES.
501 
502 JONATHAN CHANCE: WHETHER THE BIBLE  IS VALID OR NOT, YOU REAP WHAT
503 YOU SOW. AND THE PEOPLE YOU SPEAK OF .........................
504 ONE REASON WHY THOSE THINGS GO ON, IS EVERYONE SITS ON THEIR BUTTOCKS 
505 SAYING, "EVERYONES ALLOWED, ALLS COOL, DO YOUR OWN THING, "ETC.
506 IF PEOPLE REALLY FELT LOVE FOR EACH OTHER, THEY WOULD STOP SUCH
507 THINGS. I MUST DEPART.....I'M FALLING ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL!
508 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?DEBORAH?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
509 TMA: WHILE I DO AGREE THAT EXCESSIVE USE OF A WORD THAT IS NORMALLY USED
510 FOR VERY INTENSE IMPACT WILL REDUCE THE IMPACT OF IT, I DON'T FIND THAT A
511 REASON TO RESTRICT SOMEONE FROM USING IT, AS I SAID I DON'T REALLY CARE 
512 WHAT OOTHER PEOPLE USE FOR LANGUAGE, BUT I DO CARE ABOUT THE VALUES IT
513 TEACHES TO OTHERS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. I FEEL PERSONAL RESTRAINT 
514 SHOULD BE USED IN REGARD TO NOT SPEWING FOUL WORDS ALL OVER THE PLACE.
515 BUT ONCE IT HAS OCCURRED, IT MUST STILL BE LOOKED UPON AS TO THE LASTING
516 EFFECT IT WILL HAVE AND CORRECTIVE ACTION TAKEN WHERE NEEDED.
517 DR. BUCK: THE GRAVITRON IS NOT AN ACCEPTED FACT. IT IS A CONCEPT THAT HAS
518 BEEN POSTULATED TO SEE IF IT CAN HELP EXPLAIN SOME THINGS, BUT IT SO FAR
519 HAS NOT BEEN MUCH HELP IN EXPLAINING AWAY THE OPERATION OF GRAVITY.
520 BASICLY, THEY STILL HAVEN'T GOT ANY IDEA OF WHAT GRAVITY IS.
521 DEB: YOUR RECURSIVE REMINDS ME OF A FAVORITE WORD OF MINE, "IRREGARDLESS".
522 NOT ONLY IS IT A REAL WORD, BUT YOU WILL FIND IT IN THE DICTIONARY AS WELL,
523 YET IT IS AMAZING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT GET UPTIGHT OVER ITS USE, WHICH
524 IS ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE TO USE IT. AND I DO USE IT PROPERLY WHEN I
525 DO. YOU CAN EASILY TELL WHEN SOMEONE IS REALLY LISTENING TO WHAT YOU HAVE
526 TO SAY BY THE RESPONSE YOU GET TO THE VARIOUS WORDS YOU USE.
527 PAM: NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK CLEANING UP THE INN AGAIN. HMMM REMINDS ME
528 OF AN OLD SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE SKIT.. "I CLEAN UP , OK?" 
529 BUT I STILL WANT TO HEAR OF YOUR ADVENTURES WHILE YOU WERE AWAY, I AM
530 SURE THEY MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREMLY INTERESTING. BESIDES I AM GETTING BORED
531 LISTENING TO THE CONTINUED DEBATE OF PROOF OF GOD WHICH NEVER SEEMS TO
532 GET ANYWHERE. IT'S TIME FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT!

541 	Deb, you only exist if you respond?  God doesn't respond to prayers, so he
542 must not exist.  I've never had the President talk to me, so he must not
543 exist.  You come into existance only when I call this board, and the rest of
544 the time you don't exist.  That's not even a semi-valid point, it's simply
545 demonstrably false.  Whether you exist as the entity we call "Deborah" or
546 not, there is an entity composing your entries who does.  C'mon, Deb, you
547 can't slip that one over on us.

550 Dear Cistop Mikey: I suppose I must concede your point concerning the 
551 learning of values, but only in the case of those too immature to have
552 a fully developed value system of their own. Perhaps it's my particular
553 failing that I can't ever recall such a time in my own life.
554 Deborah: I must applaud either your self-control or your innocence of 
555 spirit, but I'm afraid that when I break my thumb with a hammer blow the
556 first coherent sounds I make (made) can take the leaves off trees for 
557 forty yards. My failing again, I suppose.
558 Dear Me: God DOES answer prayers, He just doesn't answer ALL of them 
559 (do YOU answer all your mail?). Some prayers (eg. "please kill my enemies"
560 ) aren't fit to answer.
561    Unfailingly yours,
562                  && The Mad Actor &&
563 ............................................................................
564 "me":	It is not possible to prove the existance(sp?) of any person or
565 object not present! 
566 	If it isn't here all the evidence I have of its existance is "hearsay".
567 We each have to decide how much of this "hearsay" is true. In an EXTREME
568 case (solipsism), a person doesn't even take the evidence of his OWN senses
569 as necessarily indicating what is "really" going on.
570 	This kind of philosophical argument CANNOT get anywhere. Before you can 
571 prove ANYTHING you must setup your basic postulates, WHICH ARE NOT PROVABLE
572 in terms of themselves! To prove THEM you would have to start with a 
573 DIFFERENT set of postulates, which once again, cannot be used to prove
574 themselves. Finally, Kurt Godel PROVED that in ANY system it is possible to 
575 make statements that cannot be proven to be true OR false. This sort of puts
576 a cramp in your style, when you start DEMANDING proof!
577 __________________________________________Leonard___________________________
578 ps. TRON: not bad, but the "shock wave" is called "Cherenkov Radiation". It
579 is generated when something exceeds the LOCAL speed of light. (Light travels
580 slower in water than in a vacuum, for example.) It is the speed of light in 
581 a VACUUM that is the "speed limit". What I worry about is the possible
582 GRAVITY shock wave (since, as far as we know, gravity travels at the
583 speed of light), THAT "shock wave" could turn you inside out or worse!

585 	The bard sat drinking the ale that the gentleman had bought him. He 
586 wondered what might come of the piper's new acquaintances.
587 	Suddenly, the room flickered (as it sometimes did while the piper played).
588 Now he found himself in some sort of bar, of a MUCH later period. It brought
589 back memories of some who had frequented the Inn. He decided to sing 
590 something in their memory. Just then the Inn returned to normal. (Normal? 
591 Here? Oh well, you know what I mean)
592 
593 	The following is dedicated to Leroy Mckane & all the other strange
594 characters he brought forth. (Farewell, Contremon!)
595 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
596 		The Walls Have Ears (words & music: Louise Foster)
597 I met her in the bar of a fine hotel,
598 And I knew that she was calling me somehow;
599 She stirred her drink with an intimate sigh,
600 And the olive gave off sparks!
601 Chorus:	The walls have ears, and the ceiling has eyes,
602 	And the waiter was an agent in disguise;
603 	And how can I tell you that I love you, dear,
604 	When I know that the walls have ears.
605 I stroked her fingers tenderly,
606 And I thought I saw my cheesecake wink at me;
607 And just when I thought I was getting to her,
608 Her earring started to whir.
609 Chorus:	.... And the wino was an agent in disguise;
610 
611 We went outside just to talk a little more,
612 And the table followed us out the door;
613 We strolled down the beach as I held her hand,
614 And saw a periscope in the sand.
615 Chorus:	... And the seagull was an agent in disguise;
616 
617 She said she was an actress in a play;
618 She came to my room, and she asked me to stay,
619 But before I could get my necktie off,
620 The bedroom mirror coughed.
621 Chorus: ... And the pillow was an agent in disguise;
622 Now we are married and we live all alone,
623 In a shack, in the desert, without a phone;
624 But sometimes it seems as I slip into bed
625 I hear a funny humming in my head.
626 Chorus:	The walls have ears and the ceiling has eyes,
627 	And the moth is a satellite in the sky;
628 	And I never will know if you love me dear,
629 	As long as the walls have ears.		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
