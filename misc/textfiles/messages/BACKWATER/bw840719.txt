49 IN THE PAST MY VISITATIONS TO THIS PARTICULAR REALITY HAVE BEEN FEW AND

52 AS SOME MAY RECALL I WAS THROWING IN NASTY LITTLE CONTROL CHARACTERS, 
53 WHICH WAS NOT MY INTENTION, DURING MY EARLIER VISITS. THIS WAS BECAUSE I

124 Frank,
125         To answer your questions...
126         1)  Face society as you are and who you are. The persecution you speak
127             of is indicative of the society you chose to live within. At least
128             have enough courage and conviction in your perversity to face  
129             societies view of your sexual orientation.
130  
131         2)  As for my " assumptions  about the natural tenets of sexual 
132             development " and " scientific evidence that my way is the
133             right way "the facts are self-evident, you are a product ( albeit
134             a poor example ) of the " natural reproductive effect " that
135             is common in a hetrosexual relationship. Your particular 
136             aberration is without such benifit...save its laxative effect.
137  
138         3)  You did imply the " if it feels good do it " cliche. I quote
139             " I don't understand how this can be so bad when it is something
140               that gives everyone so much pleasure ". The text is self
141               explanatory. Your attempt at character assassination is taken
142               with the same contempt as your depravity and thus ignored. 
143  
144         How do you deal with the duplicity in your own family, do they know ? 
145 How are you rasing your children ? What values are you imparting to them ?
146         Your use of the Homosexual parallel is without merit. As it has been 
147 said before, Their activities are conducted between consenting adults. 
148    ADULTS being the operative word. Impling that children have that same 
149 opportunity to chose has no fact in Law or morality. And thus your case for 
150 juvenile molestation is again without merit.....be it homosexual or 
151 otherwise. 
152  
153 NET7,
154         Can you be more specific .... my source is currently unaligned .....

156 interference on the part of the McKane Group....I would be happy to pass

175    Morby  faced  the  Inngoers  who really  weren't  paying  much 
176 attention, much to his dismay.
177    " Sit down, grab a drink, and let me tell you a story ", he 
178 told the people.
179    No one paid attention, but he carried on. 
180    "  When  I left this establishment four  weeks  ago,  relative 
181 time,  it was because of bad tidings I had heard of from my fief, 
182 the Country of Blackpool.  Without haste, I left to face whatever 
183 danger  presented itself,  although I left reluctently.   When  I 
184 arived,  I found that Blackpool was being runover be by armies of 
185 orcs and other nasties,  and led by the usual host of undead.   I 
186 rallied  the  tradesmen,  farmers  and  Blackpools  only  trained 
187 militia,  a  small,  thieving army.   We have lost of  our  quiet 
188 countryside to the maurauding force,  and it was not hampered  at 
189 all  by our feeble attempts at battle.   At the time that I left, 
190 only  Castle Dunbar,  or more appropriately,  where  the  thieves 
191 guild is, and Blackpools only city, called Inishmaan, remain. The
192 rest of the country is greyed and lifeless,  much in the same way 
193 that  I  am.   Worse  even  are the places where  the  fabric  of 
194 Blackpool has rippded altogether, and evil creatures lurk,  where 
195 before none existed.
196   Morby stoped and looked for listeners.
197   The  reason for my own unique coloring is the fact that I am  , 
198 for  all practical purposes,  quite dead.   I was leading a small 
199 group  of  thieves as a patrol,  where we caught of  guard  (  as 
200 usual  )  by  a much larger force of  nasties.   We  performed  a 
201 briliant tactical manuever which we are becoming famous for - the 
202 retreat.  I used myself as a decoy, and engaged the undead leader 
203 of  the enemy  patrol.   As always,  my sword broke at  the  most
204 inopertune time, and I got stuck.
205   He paused to point to a hole in his garments.
206   Such  a untimely,  violent ( and silly ) death caused me to  go 
207 into a ghost form.  Yet all hope is not lost.  Because I have the 
208 last  outcropings of of resistance in Blackpool keeping the  good 
209 side  of me still in control,  and because I have Dawg holding my 
210 physical attachment,  I could once regain my original form.   The 
211 only  problem  is  that  Blackpool must somehow  be  rid  of  the 
212 invaders,  which is no easy task.   That is where you, ladies and 
213 gentlemen, fit in.  I would like your help in riding our world of 
214 those nasties.   This could not be done by just one swoop of  the 
215 magic wand - this would be a long and involved adventure.  I have 
216 no  idea where to start,  but I have a goal, and ambition,  so we 
217 could fake our way through the whole thing.   I am making a  plea 
218 that any or all of you help me with this quest...

226 Voyeur:Yes, a good idea. What do you do when society dumps a lot of **** on you?
227 you talk to others who are worse off. Don't worry about the closit tapes,

232 Life is more rosy, should come as no supprise.
233 For if you have ever been altered, or even partway there.
234 You know life gets distorted, not that you realy care!
235 It's more a fasination you take in the mundane.
236 The lines on your hand don't look the same.
237 Hours of fun can be had, stairing into space.
238 Studying the rug design, not careing for the time or place.
239 Music takes on a new quality of harmony and tone.
240 No matter how good it is straight, its even better stoned.
241 The mind works on fantasy, reality is no more.
242 The things one comes up with are realy quite bizarre.
243 "Family nibbled to death by rabbits from outer space!"
244 Headlines like this become quite commonplace.
245 No matter if you do it to relax, or play.
246 If you have ever tried it you can relate to what I say.

295   " I commend you on your valor, although I can't say much for your

297 altogether very merry men.  Your bowmenship will be much appreciated. All
298 for life, liberty, and the pusuit of automatic checking accounts.
299   The Archer looked dazed.
300   " Oh, you have never seen autobank 24 hour tellers.  Neat things, really.
301 None in Blackpool... for that matter there are no banks.  No loss though.
302 We are luddites to the core.  No banks and such keep us from having a 
303 middle class - no problems with Harvard University, preppies and other
304 degenerate life forms.  You have never seen any?
305   " Can't say that I have ", he replied.
306   " Not as bad as punk rockers, or evangelicists.  Luckily, Blackpool has
307 none of these elements.  It is a area as trite as the Shire, which is
308 really quite good.  We are a simple people - just two social classes - us
309 and them.  Damn simple.  Is a bit hard to tell when you are us or one
310 of them, but that adds variety to life.  You need a drink? "
311   " It would help me out a tad.  Thanks.  You need a therapist?"
312   " What would (s)he do...I'm dead. "

369 Don't be too disapointed........................ I may hold your
370 glasses hostage...sorry it took me so long to get back to you...
371 Tuesday nights are for sailing...or as tonights case....pain !
372 Had a slight mishap with the spinaker pole...I lost...
373 
374 0707,
375 My source could take offence at the suggestion that perhaps he 
376 did not honestly " crack the unbreakable " such a move would 
377 certainly make the McKane group more inviting. The last time 
378 I saw him he was muttering something about strange punctuation ?
379 mean anything ?
380 Although he did want me to pass on this gibberish - -

387 THE WARM SUMMER RAIN STOPPED FALLING JUST AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SINK BENEATH THE SILVER SHROUDED DISTANT MOUNTAINS. BRINGI
388 NG MORNING TO ANOTHER PART OF THE WORLD. BEYOND, THE SKY WAS PAINTED IN PASTEL STREAKS OF ORANGE AND PINK AND GOLD, TWIL
389 IGHT FILTERED THROUGH THE TURNING MAPLE LEAVES. NATURES KALEIDOSCOPE AS IF THE BRANCHES WERE CRYSTAL, TINY RAINBOWS FLIC
390 KERING OFF AND ON AND KEEPING RHYTHEM WITH THE FADING SONGS OF A THOUSAND BIRD CHORUS. PREPARING FOR SLEEP. 
391   SO THICK WERE THE LEAVES ABOVE THAT THE FOREST FLOOR WAS NEARLY DRY, AS I TOO, PREPARED FOR MY REST. ABOVE ME, A SQUIR
392 REL CHATTERED NOISILY, AS IF TO SCOLD ME FOR TRESPASSING IN HIS HOME. I CHATTERED BECK GOOD NATUREDLY, AND AFTER AN APPR
393 ISING STARE, HE SCAMPERED AWAY, FORAGING FOR MAPLE SEEDS, I THOUGHT, IN THESE FEW MINUTES OF LIGHT LEFT. 
394    A GENTLE BREEZE RUSTLED THE TREES ABOVE ME, AND DROPS OF RAIN FELL ABOUT ME. I TURNED MY FACE UPWARD TO GREET THEM. 
395 AROUND ME, THE FOREST BECAME SILENT, IT'S EERIE STILNESS BELYING THE UNHEARD FOOTSTEPS OF NOCTURNAL HUNTERS, YAWNING 
396 AWAKE, READY FOR ANOTHER DAY. 
397    IT WAS THE DAY OF THE SUMMER SOLSTICE, AND A HUNTERS MOON WOULD SOON BE RISING. UNSEEN BENEATH THE CANOPY OF FOILAGE,
398 HERALDED BY THE PLAINTIVE, MOURNFUL CRY OF THE COYOTE. CRAWLING INTO MY SMALL TENT, I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO SEE A 
399 RACCOON LYING BESIDE MY BEDROLL. HE SEEMED UNPERTURBED BY MY PRESENCE, AND MADE NO ATTEMPT TO LEAVE, SO I BADE HIM GOOD 
400 NIGHT, AND THINKING OF THE MORROWS JOURNEY, SLIPPED INTO A PEACEFUL, DREAMLESS SLEEP. MY LAST THOUGHTS WERE OF WHAT LAY 
401 BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS, WHERE, TOMORROW, I WOULD BE----[*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*]
402 *******************************************************************************************************************
403 A SMALL STATURED, BLOND-HAIRED, BLUE-EYED STRANGER WALKED INTO THE INN. HE HAD THE LOOK OF A FERAL, CUNNING
404 ANIMAL. HE WALKED OVER TO MORBY AND ASKED HIM HOW HE FELT...
405      "I'D LIKE TO OFFER MY SERVICES TO YOU TO HELP SAVE BLACKPOOL"
406      "FINE... UH, YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE A WAY TO CROSS TO BLACKPOOL??"
407      "NEIN. I WISH I DID, THOUGH. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE TO GET IS THERE"
408      "PERHAPS THE DOCTOR SHALL SHOW UP AND GIVE US A LIFT. LET'S SEE IF HE IS POSSIBLY IN THIS GENERAL TIME-SPACE AREA"
409 
410 MORBY PAUSED A MINUTE AND ASKED  "WHAT IS THY NAME? I FORGOT TO ASK."
411 
412      " I'M KNOWN AS THE UNBELIEVER BECAUSE OF MY DISBELIEF IN MOST THINGS IN GENERAL"
413            -----UNBELIEVER
414 
415 ALL: I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ANYONE HAS SEEN ONE OF THE LATEST GAMES. IT IS CALLED "RINGWORLD".
416 THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS UNBELIEVABLY SIMPLE AND HAS EVERTHING INCLUDING TASPS.
417 THERE ARE THREE CHARACTER RACES: HUMANS AND HOMINIDS, KZINTI, AND PUPPETEERS.
418  
419 I'LL LET EVERYONE KNOW MORE LATER. IT MIGHT BE FUN TO GET TOGETHER A GROUP BESIDES THE AD&D GROUP I PLAY IN.
420  
421 ANYBODY WHO IS INTERESTED IN THE GAME ITSELF PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE TO "THE UNBELIEVER" OR SIMILAR NAME........
422    BYE..................................................................................................................
423 F. FIN. (FINNEGAN, J.T. KIRKS NEMESIS, IS THAT YOU?): DO YOU HAVE ANY TRANSMORGANIAN GLOW CRYSTALS? I'M ALSO INTERESTED 
424 IN A FEW LIPTULIAN KORPOID TREES (FROM THE ALGOL SYSTEM). I'D LIKE THE MINEATURE ONES. IF SO, PLEASE LEAVE MESSAGE FOR 
425 C. LOVONOVITCH ON FREEBOOTERS

427   Gee, Milchar, no story? well, ok. goodnight.
428   And Unbeliever, Ringworld does sound interesting. Tell me more.

431 Alex:  Message received and understood.  I am indeed impressed. 
432 After going back and reviewing everything you have entered since agent 07's
433 first coded message, I now understand all the hints and veiled references you
434 made.  The NETWORK will be discussing this unprecedented occurrance ASAP.
435 In the meantime, we appreciate the contents of your last coded communique',
436 but request that you send one more coded message to either 07 or myself
437 to verify that this was indeed not a fluke.  Under the circumstances, I am
438 sure you can understand our caution.

441 Grand DragonMaster - I take your comments to Wassir regarding my entries
442 as, at best, a backhanded compliment.  The reason we engage in such long-winded
443 narratives is that we are waiting for some participation by the chief
444 antagonist. (or protagonist, if it makes you feel better; the result is the same).
445 You are well aware of the fact that L'homme and myself are playing your
446 adversaries; yet you decline to confront us.  The closest you have come to
447 acknowledging us is to toss in the item that Petrov was the stripper in
448 disguise, and to send flowers to L'homme at the Plaza Hilton.  In order to 
449 make any story out of those meager offerings, we had to build whole entries 
450 out of those bits, thus requiring those 'longwinded narratives' to integrate
451 them.  There is someone named Hunter waiting for you in your office, but again
452 the confrontation is being avoided--he is still waiting.  When someone decides
453 to actively drag you into participation, you "wake up.  'What a terrible dream!'"
454 The way things stand, L'homme and I are just writing back and forth to each
455 other, with "McKane" as a nebulous nemesis who is never seen or even felt,
456 but merely serving as an excuse for a story.
457      Perhaps now that your beloved Albanian firebrand has returned, we
458 poor second-raters can see what it is that 'turns you on'.
459 I await the great interactions, perched eagerly on the edge of my seat.

461 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
462    L'homme and Joshua were discussing contracts with Rocky, while I smiled,
463 nodded, and pretended to understand their references.
464 "Come, let us move to a more comfortable meeting area."  That was Rocky.
465 He smiled and led us to a private dining room.
466    The doors swung wide and...  Argh!  Seated at the head of the table was a
467 black robed ominous figure who had a breathing problem.  Within seconds, all
468 three of us were surrounded by a host of oriental thugs--all well versed in the
469 martial arts.  Joshua eyed Rocky coldly. "Thanks a lot, buddy!"
470 "I'm sorry, Joshua."  Rocky tried to explain.  "They arrived just before you did.
471 There was nothing I could do."
472    "Get off it Rocky," L'homme interrupted.  "Anyone could see the hidden door
473 over there."  Fantastic!  L'homme pointed out the faint outlines of a door in
474 the back of the room--almost impossible to spot.  With lightning speed L'homme
475 threw several amazing punches and kicks.  The thugs guarding him were out cold.
476 While Joshua and I watched in stunned silence, L'homme took the floor.
477 "It's obvious that these hoods operate from this location.  That door leads to
478 their hideout."  L'homme picked up a fortune cookie and casually extracted the
479 philosophical contents.  "Not your day for serious confrontations."  He looked
480 at Rocky.  "So sorry, must have taken yours."
481    The black robed individual finally spoke. He had been watching the goings-ons
482 quite amusedly.  "I'm afraid the fortune is yours, L'homme.  Your skillful antics
483 were regretfully wasted. My security extends deeper than you could know."
484 The man (named Nader), described the impressive security measures around the
485 room.  Poison gas, surveillence cameras, blow darts, crossbow slits, etc--all
486 strategically placed throughout the restaurant.  L'homme realized the futility
487 of his actions, or at least he seemed to.  The secret door swung open and
488 Nader led us into the deep unknown.
489    "Time to learn some secrets through ancient chinese tortures.  Into the
490 Dragon Room!"  L'homme and I were shocked. Joshua turned to us sporting an
491 impressive blush.  He volunteered nervously, "Coincidence?"

495      My private life seems to have stirred up quite a furror.
496 With so many reactions I doubt I'll have time to respond to 
497 everyone. My apologies.
498      I'd like to mention that I'm not "sitting back laughing 
499 my head off". This is not a Phantom Writer getting his kicks 
500 by annoying people.
501      My intention was to provoke intelligent discussion of 
502 issues that lack the pat answers you're all so fond of. So 
503 far I've been only marginally successful. Of the responses 
504 I've illicited only THE LAZY ONE has said anything I can 
505 respect. He spoke from experience, didn't try to fake 
506 scientific justification for his opinions, and obviously 
507 spent some time and thought on his answer. The rest of you 
508 either dodged the issues or offered threats.
509     I'm touched that you're all so concerned about my mental 
510 health. You'll be happy to know that I've been undergoing 
511 therapy for a number of years. My therapist has greatly helped 
512 me build my confidence by teaching me to accept myself as 
513 I am. 
514      Those of you who want me behind bars are probably the 
515 same fools who consider taxation legalized theft. Hate to tell 
516 you this boys, but no taxes means no prison space, no control 
517 of "child molesters", and no help for "abused children". Tough 
518 luck.
519      Dante - Loved the Inferno, can hardly wait for the movie 
520 to come out, can't say as much for your more recent writing.
521      Homosexuality and Adult/child love have been with 
522 humanity for as long as recorded history. But perhaps your 
523 right, maybe evolution is against me. If so, I'll change my 
524 ways in a million or so years.
525     Your arguements sound strangely like Biblical 
526 admonishments aginst perversion; you merely replaced the 
527 authority of God with the authority of evolutionary science. 
528 I'm not impressed.{that bothers me not - the feeling is mutual.  Dante}
529     Alex - Having an unpopular sexual predisposition has 
530 nothing to do with conviction. It's a matter of birth or 
531 circumstances. You didn't think that one through.
532     Piper - Thoreau is hardly an example of moral righteousness
533 or manliness. Why should I emulate an unmarried, squeeky 
534 voiced, antisocial outcast who got his jollies fondling fish 
535 and doing God knows what to helpless woodland creatures.
536     Thoreaus only claim to distinction is the social prominance
537 he attained through hob-nobbing with the Emersons. The only 
538 reason he accepted incarceration is because he didn't have 
539 anything better to do. That's not my style.
540     TO ALL - I'm giving up on finding the sparkling wit, 
541 probing intelligence, and profound insights Backwater 
542 discussions are supposed to revel. You have been a big 
543 dissapointment. I'll still read your messages but I am 
544 through as a contributor.

549 C. Lovonovitch, no I'm not J.T. Kirks' nemisis. Not even related to him! I
550 do not, at this time, have the merchandise you request. The shuttle from
551 that sector is overdue and I fear it may have been hit by pirates or worse
552 freelance Libiyan terrorists. A quite valuable shipment of Galranian thought
553 gems were to have been on the said shuttle. These stones have a molecular
554 matrix which allows the wearer to utilize those PSI abilities inherent in
555 us all. A sort of PSI ampliflier, if you will. They can also be used to
556 effect mind control, if used, in the proper combination. I have logged a
557 file for your request, though, and will contact you as soon as they are in.
558 Frank: I can7t sympathise with a person who won't help himself. As for your
559 self appointed Ph. D. I can only say nuts to ya! To assume yourself above
560 and beyond the laws and obligations of our society (which you live in, work
561 in and "play" in) is tantamount ot treason of the HUMAN race!! To coerce
562 young children to take part in ADULT role models (such as sex) is of a
563 most decadent nature. Why don't you allow young people to grow up and form
564 their own decisions and ideas about what is or isn't "good" for them? It
565 seems to me you were probably a victim of such "abuse" at one time yourself
566 and were never given the guidance you needed to make a value judgement of
567 where this all fits in our society. Please seek professional help, it is
568 the greatest thing you could do for yourself. That is if you really care.
569 As for hiding away and just watching this unfold before your eyes, so be it!

574 stop you!
575 At the Inn...
576 People sitting around tables, drinking ale and telling tales. A tiny but
577 irritating whine fills the room. Some know what it is, having been around the
578 last time. Others are puzzled at the sound which varis not.
579 In the mens bathroom A.K.A. the roman baths, A bath can be seen to start moving
580 . After coming partway open, an observer could see a small cryo-capsule, but 
581 the only observers knew what was happening. A clunk and the whine became louder.
582 The glass top of the unit finaly defrosted enough so that one could see the life
583 -less form of a man inside, curiously dressed in gray robes. The lid of this 
584 device poped open and a mechanical female voice could be heard. "Please remove 
585 body and place MEGA-CHARGE card in the glowing slot" this compleated the 
586 observers say the proper words and the unit goes back into hiding, and its cargo
587 comes alive.
588 "Oh great, they sent you two. What now?" asked the man who was but frozen pulp
589 a few moments earlier.
590 "Lord Graymalkin, there is a dissident movement forming in the Backwater Inn at
591 this very moment to de-gray whats left of Blackpool!"
592 "Morby again?"
593 "Yes m'lord, it is him"
594 "Now you would think he got the message last time when we hung him upside down
595 over that vat of, well, some things are better not discused in others presence."
596 For then a door had opened into the baths and none other the Lord Morby entered.
597 "I thought I heard a noise in here?"
598 "And you did good sir, Allow me to introduce myself. I am Graymalkin, and I wish
599 to join you in your quest!"
600 A slight grin could be noticed on one of the observers.

612 Petrov: Glad to hear from you again. I must admit I am surprised by the
613         direction you have taken us, and I must sit back and re-read the
614         entry before I formulate my own. After your confrontation with d,
615         joshua and I thought we might not hear from you again. I am glad we
616         were wrong. As you can see by joshua's very well written message to
617         McKane, we are in a sort of quandary. Your entry is well recieved!
618 Alex  : I imagine NET 07 was in a state of shock after seeing the NET's beloved
619         code broken. How much did the time on the Cray cost you? I would
620         imagine that your input on the side of McKane would be greatly
621         appreciated, especially in the light of your masterful code break.
622         The NET will only be vulnerable until we meet again, and until then
623         code traffic will be light indeed.
624 joshua: People who forget sunglasses are suspect spies at best. What would
625         happen if you forgot your gun? Your message to McKane was superb.
626         The lump in my throat swelled with every word. Tres Tres bien. Merci!
627 Frank : I know you won't responde, but since you said you were going to continue
628         to be a lurker, I have a couple questions for you. Just what did you
629         expect to get from BW. And if it is so bad, why keep calling? *%L'homme*
