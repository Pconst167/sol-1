43 all the rest of the adventures (including the last one) run aground? I
44 will await your reply on that one.
45 Hawthorne: I too have talked on the phone to the death to person. It turns
46 out, like MIG wrote, he is not a bad fellow. It was a case of seeing the
47 Inn being taken over by lowlifes of undescribable description(!) On a
48 further note, do you notice the absence of these lowlifes?
49 MIG: Did you get that from your French girl friend? If so, does she have a

63 Ater cleaning up the messes they had left (such as they could--what was
64 too unpleasant they left for the scavengers), the bard, L'homme, and voyeur
65 set off on their journey.  What route they were taking, voyeur had no idea, L'homme found out when the bard would say 
66 "turn here."  What the bard knew, he wasn't revealing.  When pressed, all he would offer was "I don't want to worry you
67 needlessly."  After travelling through an endless variety of scenery, the battered Mustang came to a road.  Actually, it
68 was more of a ROAD than a road.  It was quite wide, and seemed to go on forever.  In the sky over the road was a line,
69 parallelling the road.  The bard indicated that they should stop, while he took bearings.  For lack of anything better to 
70 do while waiting for the bard, L'homme and voyeur watched the occasional car pass on the road.  Watching cars may sound
71 only slightly more interesting than watching ice cream melt, but these were unusual cars.  Everything from a coach-in-four
72 to a 65 Dodge pickup to exceedingly fast ultra-streamlined teardrops.  After some time they saw an old VW bug approach, 
73 slow down to look, then speed up and depart in a hurry.  L'homme said, startled, "Hey, that looked just like Adolf.." 
74 "It was," said the bard, looking up from what he was doing.  "He's still looking for the place where he won."
75 As bard went back to his calculations, L'homme explained to voyeur who the man in the Volkswagen, with the short mustache,
76 was.  {if any of you don't know where we are yet, tough!}
77 Finally the bard seemed satisfied, and told L'homme to get on the road and drive at whatever speed was comfortable.  The 
78 general rule seemed to be that the overtaking vehicles had to watch out for the slower ones, but the slower ones had to 
79 keep to the right.  L'homme waited for a clear moment, pulled out onto the road, and drove.
80 Some time later, one of the futuristic cars pulled alongside and slowed down to pace them.  The bard looked over, said 
81 "Oh ****", and sank down in the seat as if trying not to be seen.  The car slowed down and pulled behind the Mustang, and 
82 flashing lights came on.  L'homme muttered something about cops being the same all over, and started to slow down.  Just 
83 then the police car sped up again, and as it passed, one of the occupants yelled out the window "You're lucky this time,
84 Dorakeen.  Something more important just came up.  We'll get you one of these times!"  With that the police car accelerated
85 and disappeared.  L'homme had visions of a Mazda doing something similar, and wondered if he would find Tek up the road a bit
86 Finally, L'homme getting rather worried about his fuel gauge, the bard indicated to pull off at the next rest stop.  "There
87 will be gasoline available there, and no problem paying for it."
88 A short time later they saw a sign by the road, which said "The Last Exit To Babylon, 6 miles."  "It should be just before
89 that exit," bard told L'homme.
90 ::::::::::::::::::::::
91 Our part of the adventure had slowed down, so I thought I'd get something
92 going again.  Unfortunately, this idea seemed to be most appropriate for bard, with L'homme participating some, and voyeur
93 totally lost.  Sorry if I abused your characters; it was either that or wait for you to do something, and I decided to 
94 make the attempt to open new ground.
95 Bard: I'm sure you know where we are, but L'homme is probably still in the dark.
96 L'homme: this is another book by the same man who brought us the Amber stories. (Roger Zelazny). I expect you to run out 
97 and get a copy and read it by Saturday, so you will be able to participate intelligently. (ahem..).  After all, this is
98 certainly more important than that dumb old Fortran, no?

111 			The Man in Gray
112 ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
113 The man with the book floating in front of him exited his domicile on the 
114 way over to the inn. Looking back at his tower he mused to himself, It 
115 is pretty obvious isn't it. Pulling three seeds from his pocket he walked
116 around the tower droping them to the ground and pushing them into it with
117 his heel. Now, a little water and some light he thought. There, he muttered
118 a few words and an Oak, an Ash, and a Thorn tree sprouted and started
119 growing at an enormous rate of speed. As they grew the tower shrunk in
120 size until it was little bigger than a small cottage in appearance. There
121 that looks better the lazy one thought to himself. Now where's that beer?
122 After all, "there's no time like the present for postponing what you don'
123 t want to do." and I sure don't feel like setting up that card file of 
124 spells right now.
125 ************************************* THE LAZY ONE ***********************
126 ****************************************************************************
127 When Greeneyes saw Whisper come back into the common room she crept up to
128 her rather apologeticly. Pushing her thoughts out she said into Whispers
129 head. Sorry about jumping all over you but that last step surprised me.
130 ************************************ GREENEYES ***************************
131 Whisper was a little surprised to see that big cat that had sown up with
132 apprentice coming her way. And even more surprised when she heard a voice
133 inside her head appologize for jumping all over her. But, ever quick on the 
134 uptake, she thought back gemtly, That's allright I wasn't prepared for that
135 ride myself.

155 Mikey: Is COPYLINK a sort of super-XMODEM? In any case, what is necessary for a 
156 machine to be able to use it (ie what would be a 'generic' minimum configuration
157 of memory storage, etc)? In other words, what kinds of machine can you write 
158 versions for?
159 _____________________________Leonard____________________________________________
160 	The apprentice turned to Whisper, "I do not think Green Eyes will start
161 anything, but I do hope that that wolf hath enough sense to leave well enough
162 alone!"
163 	"At least the Inn is starting to fill up."
164 ................................the apprentice..................................
165 Voyeur: Actually, what I had in mind was more along the line of the type of
166 shift in Norton's "Crossroads of Time" & "Quest Crosstime" or H. Beam Piper's
167 Paratime stories. Oh, well...
168 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
169 	The Bard looked over at voyeur. "It's not what you think, they ALWAYS
170 mistake me for Dorakeen! It wouldn't be any problem, except I can't show them
171 my ALTECO id. ALTECO doesn't get along too well with them..."
172 
173 	He turned to Dreamtoucher, "I'll try some of the meat. I hope it isn't
174 horse again!"
175 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
176 For all the Trekkies out there...
177 	Banned From Argo (words & music: Leslie Fish)
178 When we pulled into Argo Port in need of R and R,
179 The crew set out investigating every joint and bar.
180 We had high expectations of their hospitality,
181 But found too late it wasn't geared for spacers such as we.
182 CHORUS:	And we're banned from Argo, every one.
183 	Banned from Argo just for having a little fun.
184 	We spent a jolly shore leave there,
185 	For just three days or four,
186 	But Argo doesn't want us any more.
187 The Captain's taste's were simple, but his methods were complex.
188 We found him with five partners, each of a different world and sex.
189 The Shore Police were on their way -- we had no second chance.
190 We beamed him up in the nick of time -- and the remnants of his pants.
191 CHORUS
192 Our Engineer would yield to none at putting down the brew.
193 He outdrank seven space marines and a demolition crew.
194 The Navigator didn't win, but he outdrank almost all,
195 And now they've got a shuttlecraft on the roof of City Hall.
196 CHORUS
197 Our proper, cool First Officer was drugged with something green,
198 And hauled into an alley, where he suffered things obscene.
199 He sobered up in Sickbay and he's none the worse for wear,
200 Except he's somehow taught the bridge computer how to swear.
201 CHORUS
202 The Head Nurse disappeared awhile in the major Dope Bazaar,
203 Buying an odd green potion "guaranteed to cause Pon-Farr".
204 She came home with no uniform and an oddly cheerful heart,
205 And a painful way of walking -- with her feet a yard apart.
206 CHORUS
207 Our lady of Communications won a ship-wide bet
208 By getting into the planet's main communications net.
209 Now every time someone calls up on an Argo telescreen,
210 The flesh is there, but the clothes they wear are nowhere to be seen.
211 CHORUS
212 Our Doctor loves Humanity; his private life is quiet.
213 The Shore Police arrested him for inciting whores to riot.
214 We found him in the city jail, locked on and beamed him free --
215 Intact except for hickeys and six kinds of VD.
216 CHORUS
217 Our Helmsman loves exotic plants; the plants all love him too.
218 He took some down on leave with him, and we wondered what they'd do.
219 'Til the planetary governor called and swore upon his life
220 That a gang of plants entwined his house and then seduced his wife!
221 CHORUS
222 A gang of pirates landed, and nobody seemed to care.
223 They stamped into the nearest bar to announce that they were there.
224 Half our crew was busy there, and invited them to play,
225 But the pirates only looked at us, and turned and ran away.
226 CHORUS
227 Our crew is Starfleet's finest, and our record is our pride.
228 And when we play we tend to leave a trail a mile wide.
229 We're sorry about the wreckage and the riots and the fuss;
230 At least we're sure that planet won't be quick forgetting us!
231 CHORUS
232 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
233 MIG, voyeur, L'homme, etc:	I plan to be at the swap meet Saturday. Is 
234 anybody else going to be there?
235 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

237    I feel like I've been walking for miles.......  But I'm sure this is
238 the right road.  Wait, up ahead, I never saw that house there before. the
239 three trees either.  Hmmm...  that's the inn next to it alright. A good
240 brew would certainly be good about now..........
241     Walking through the door, I almost walk right back out.  The time has
242 come to really start to wonder about this place.  I could have sworn the
243 wall was shifting, and there is a large cat seeming to be in conversation
244 with the apprentice and his freind.  What's that over there? a Wolf?

252 Back by popular demand, it's QUIZMASTER! (Well, L'homme asked about me, anyway).
253 Today's puzzle:
254 	A rope over the top of a fence has the same length on each side.  It weighs
255 one third of a pound per foot. On one end hangs a monkey holding a banana,
256 and on the other end a weight equal to the weight of the monkey.  The banana
257 weighs two ounces per inch.  The rope is as long (in feet) as the age of the
258 monkey (in years), and the weight of the monkey (in ounces) is the same as the
259 age of the monkey's mother.  The combined ages of the monkey and its mother are
260 thirty years.  One half the weight of the monkey, plus the weight of the banana,
261 is one fourth as much as the weight of the weight and the weight of the rope.  
262 The monkey's mother is half as old as the monkey will be when it is three times
263 as old as its mother was when she was half as old as the monkey will be when
264 it is as old as its mother will be when she is four times as old as the monkey
265 was when it was twice as old as its mother was when she was one third as old
266 as the monkey was when it was as old as its mother was when she was three times
267 as old as the monkey was when it was one fourth as old as it is now (Whew!)
268 How long is the banana?

292 along, I don't forsee any serious problems. Besides even if they did get
293 in a fight they couldn't possibly do any more damage to the inn than we

302   Morby took another gulp of the local ale, and noticed how the crowd was 
303 watching Dawg.
304   " He is really quite friendly, unless I tell him not to be.  He and I have an
305 understanding, and all things work out fine."
306    Morby turned and faced the Innkeeper.
307   " I'd like a room, lowest floor possible I case I have to make a quick 
308 departure.  I'll go stable my horse, and return in a moment."
309    He grabed his sword, and left the room.  Dawg let his mangy rest on his paws
310 until Morby got back.  He carried in his small amount of belongings and his bow,
311 and started walking to his room.
312   He stopped and looked at the crowd.
313   "  When does the fun begin?  I'm a simple man actually, and although I have a
314 small castle in the north ( or is it south from here? ), I live a wandering
315 life that my kind enjoys.  Quite simply, I'm a rogue."
316   He then reached into his cloak, and pulled out a battered hat and attempted
317 to make the feather on it look respectable.  He put it on his head, and then
318 took it off and bowed in a cavalier manner.  He then crumpled it up and 
319 returned it to his cloak.
320   "  I must rest now...good night or whatever."

362 IN MSDOS IT USES 76K CURRENTLY  (NOT COUNTING WHAT IS TAKEN UP BY THE
363 OPERATING SYSTEM AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU HAVE RUNNING) CPM VERSION NEEDS
364 38K DISK SPACE MINIMUM. MSDOS DISK SPACE IS TWO FILES ONE 10K AND THE
365 OTHER 36K. IT REQUIRES A DISK TYPE SYSTEM. AND OF COURSE A PORT TO 
366 COMMUNICATE THRU. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT SOME OF ITS FEATURES ARE
367 OPERATING SYSTEM DEPENDANT AS FAR AS GATHERING DISK INFORMATION TO
368 PRESENT TO THE USER. AND OF COURSE VERY MACHINE DEPENDANT AS FAR AS
369 THE COMM PORT IS CONCERNED. CPM SYSTEMS HAVE THE PORT SECTION SEPERATLY
370 LOCATED TO MAKE IT EASY TO INSTALL. MSDOS PRESENTS A BIT OF A PROBLEM
371 BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO USE INTERRUPTS TO MAKE IT WORK RIGHT, SO
372 CURRENTLY IT IS A BIT MESSY TO INSTALL (FACTORY INSTALLATION ONLY).
373 THE WHOLE MESS IS WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLER OVER 250K OF SOURCE ON CPM, 
374 AND OVER 300K IN MSDOS.

387 12 hour shifts now?

389 bard: I could not find either "Crossroads of Time" or "Quest Crosstime" in my 39 Norton books, and I have
390 never gotten around to H. Beam Piper.  So, I guess the ball is in your court
391 (unless L'homme cares to give it a try?)
392 I seem to recall you singing your last two entries, one time when I was at 
393 your abode.  The Chemist's Drinking Song is particularly memorable (that chorus.
394 especially..).

396 HAWTHORNE: were you interviewing the PorSFiS members last Saturday?
397 I've also heard some less-than-complimentary things said about the

422 "The Key!  Do you mean we've finally found it?  But how?  We've searched for
423 it for such a long time with no results.  Why now?"   "Well, I've set the 
424 Tardis' scanners for the greatest chronal energy distortion, which means that
425 we homed in on the Key.  It must be on this planet somewhere, and this planet
426 must be called something.  K-9, do a extensive scan of all data banks for the
427 name and all relavent data on this planet, using all available data to correlate
428 the search."   "Searching, Master... Planet's co-ordinates are 64934,79847.
429 Name: Skaro.  Available data: none, except sensors indicate that the Black
430 Gurardian in immediate vicinity, Master."
431 "Fiddlesticks!", exclaims Milchar, and as he does, the sound of dozens of 
432 violins fill the air.  Suddenly, a knock on the Tardis' outer dodor brings
433 everyone's head turned round.  "Who could that be?  Tea time isn't until 4:00."

451 HAWTHORN: HOW CAN BORDOM BE?
452 HAPPINESS IS A PROCESS NOT AN END POINT.  SUCCESS IS KNOWING WHAT YOU LIKE 
453 TO DO AND BEING IN THE PROCESS OF DOING IT.  FOR THAT MATTER; PERFECTION
454 IS A PROCESS ALSO; THE PROCESS OF PERPETUAL OPTOMIZATION!
455 ANYWHOO... HOW ABOUT GETTING YOURSELF A SOLDERING IRON AND SOME I.C.'S AND A 
456 BUNCH OF BOOKS ET.C AND BUILDING A CREY SOMETHING OR OTHER IN THE COMPFORT AND 
457 CONVIENCE OF YOUR BASEMENT, BATHROOM, LIVINGROOM ET.C...
458 ON THE OTHERHAND, IF YOURE ALREADY SUPERSATURATED WITH THIS STUFF THAIR IS AN 
459 UNLIMITED RANGE OF AMUSING AND CREATIVE WAYS TO PASS THE TIME.  GENERALY 
460 ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES BRINGING INTO REALITY SOMETHING WHICH FIRST EXISTS ONLY 
461 IN YOUR HEAD, ANY OUTLET FOR CREATIVE EXPRESSION, PREFFERABLY ONE THAT
462 INVOLVES BUILDING RATHER THAN PASSIVE COLLECTING OR OBSERVING WILL PROVIDE
463 PLEASURE AND INCIDENTLY POSSIBLY SELF-IMPROVEMENT AS WELL.  ALL OF EXISTANCE
464 IS THE BALANCE BETTEWEEN CREATION AND ENTROPY, AND AS WE ALL KNOW,
465 ENTROPY CAN DAMND WELL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF!

478 DREAMTOUCHER--I don't know if it was you, but since yours is the last entry,
479 I'll address it to you.  When leaving Backwater, it is proper to type "off",
480 else the next person gets "file unstable" when logging on.
481 ????????????
482 SHTONER--It reminds me of that scene in "E.T.", where Elliot is telling one
483 of his friends about his alien friends problem, and his friend suggests
484 "Why doesn't he just beam up?" to which Elliot replies in disgust "This is reality!"
485 I think the Star Trek triviation fits in here somewhere.
486 In answer to your "reality" question, I had to dig up my old July 21, 1969
487 Oregonian (rather yellow and brittle), which indicates that the landing took
488 place at 7:56 p.m. (PDT) on July 20,1969.  I remember it well.
489 I was between my sophomore and junior year in HS.
490 The plaque says "Here men from the planet earth first set foot on the moon
491 July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind."
492 You realize, of course, that "reality" is sooo boring and insignificant when
493 compared to the razzle-dazzle of Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.  What jaded 
494 video junkie would be satisfied with something as primitive as a Saturn 5 when
495 there are such exciting things as Death Stars in the Universe?

515   After some sleep time,  Morby and Dawg steped out of their room.  He turned to
516 the Innkeeper.
517   " Some food please, anything will do.  And some meat for my wolf."
518   He then turned towards the regulars.
519   " What we need here is some action.  You know, riding the world of evil, or
520 at least their wealth." A smile crept across his face.  "  We could all leave,
521 or we could wait and put up an add for " Nasties who want to be beat up - come
522 to the Inn. " I'm sure we would get great results"

536 I REMEMBER THE GOOD OL' DAYS WHEN BACKWATER WAS A BASTION OF CREATIVITY AND 
537 ADVENTURES HAD SOME ACTION. NOW DAYS IT SEEM ADVENTURES CONSIST OF ORDERING AN 
538 ALE AT THE INN AND HINTING THAT MAYBE SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN. WHAT HAPPENED TO 
539 THE OLD SPIRIT? WHERE HAS THE CREATIVITY AND IMAGINATION THAT MADE BACKWATER SO 
540 INTERESTING GONE TO? THINGS HAVE REALLY GOTTEN DULL.
541    I KNOW. YOU'RE GOING TO SAY "IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHY DON'T YOU CONTRIBUTE 
542 SOMETHING TO GET IT GOING". QUITE FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW IT'S WORTH THE TROUBLE. 
543 MAYBE IF I SAW SOME CREATIVE TALENT I WOULD GET INSPIRED. I CERTAINLY HAVEN'T 
544 SEEN ANYTHING THAT EVEN REMOTELY RESEMBLES TALENT, CREATIVITY, OR IMAGINATION IN

581 WITH FRUSTRATION.HE COULD NOT   SCREAM;HIS LUNGS WERE SHRINKING AND ONE WAS REFORMING.THE LAST  THOUGHTS OF THE SECOND FORMER
582 WERE FEAR AND PAIN.THE SECOND FO RMER DIED.

586 REACTOR,OR A ZERO ROOM.HIS MIND WAS WILD WITH PAIN HE WAS BESERK IN HIS NEED OF AID.THE STEED   WAS BEING RIDDEN HARD,THROUGH 
587 EIGHT REALITIES,THE ELECTRO-REAL ITY CIRCUITS WERE SHORTING AND THE HORSE WAS BEING TORTURED BY THE BURNING METAL AND PLASTIC
588 IN HIS BRAIN.THE STEED BRUSHED  LIGHTLY BY A TREE AND BROKE THE FORMER'S NEW AND UNSURE LEG.AND YET THE FORMER WAS AS CLOSE TO
589 HAPPY AS HE HAD BEEN SINCE THE  FALL.FOR HE SAW THE INNER LIGHTS OF THE INN STREAMING THROUGH   THE DOORS AND THE FOG.IN FRONT
590 OF THE DOORS LEANING ON A WALL  WAS A RANGER OF SOME SORT.THE   FORMER WHINED IN PAIN,ASKING FOR HELP WITHOUT THE AID OF LANG-
591 UAGE.HIS MIND DID NOT GRASP THE CONCEPT ALL IT HAD KNOWN WAS THE SHEAR PAINS OF AGONY.
