26 RUTHLESS KILLER LOOSE IN NEW YORK CITY
27 By Franklin Pervis
28 
29 Muggers, rapists, pickpockets and burglars abound in this bustling metropolis
30 we call New York City. But none of these people offers the threat to our way
31 of life as one man does.
32 
33 That one man, who goes by the name of Delta V, kills not for profit, not for
34 the good of mankind or any national cause, but simply for the sake of doing it.
35 He has chosen this profession because he enjoys killing, and cannot be stopped
36 until he himself is dead.
37 
38 And my aim is steady and sure... I see Delta V's profile in my sights, the 
39 sights of the proverbial pen. Is the pen still stronger than the sword, or now
40 I should say, the Walther? I suppose we will find out soon, but the pen is
41 only mighty when the public unites in a common cause.
42 
43 I have provided descriptions of the man in previous articles, and below it is
44 repeated again, along with a police sketch. But he has many faces, and is
45 extremely dangerous. If you spot him, call this paper. My editor will notify
46 me, even though I have gone underground, and am in hiding.
47 
48 Delta V is in a shabby hotel somewhere in this city, and my best information
49 has it that he is in a disguise of a street person. He is after a man called
50 McKane. Other agencies are after Delta V, but they cannot impede my efforts at
51 exposing this threat to our very way of
52 life.
53 
54 Delta V... your days are numbered. You may kill one on one, or two on one, but
55 20 million people will overwhelm you, and rush your lifeless body into the
56 sewers where it belongs.

64    Tariya was startled. "Who I am? You know my name."
65    "And that's just about all I know."
66    "But why would you want to know about me?"
67    "I just do. You have some reason for hiding your past?"
68    She looked down at her hands. "No. Not really."
69    "Then tell me."
70    "All right." she said. "My mother, Marannon Qoasis xennon-Silmarilyn, is the ruler of Shai-Kahn, and has been for
71 the last thirteen years since my father was assasinated. I have five sisters and four brothers, all older than me.
72 Since I am female, and youngest, there is very little chance that I will inherit the throne. Hence, the royal tutors
73 have wasted very little time with me except for the standard education every child gets. If I was called upon to rule
74 the province any time soon, I would be totally incapable. Though nobody has ever said so, I am considered
75 expendable."
76    "Jeez." James said. "I'm sorry. That's awful."
77    "I've had seventeen years to get used to it." she smiled, a little sadly. "When I turn eighteen, the plan is to
78 marry me off to some prince of another province who hasn't even been selected yet. This is done to strengthen
79 relations between provinces."
80    "And that's why you really took off, right?"
81    "No. After all, the man I marry might be quite handsome. There are worse fates. I have an aptitude for the mystic
82 arts. Since I was five, I have been training to become a sorceress. One day, not long ago, for some reason I still
83 don't understand, I became bored. I wanted to see something of this universe before I commited my life to casting
84 spells or having babies. That is really strange because I really had no desire to do anything like this before. It's
85 almost like somebody else decided for me."
86    Maybe somebody did, James thought. He had a naturally suspicious mind, anyway. "What about this bunch that I'm
87 supposed to destroy."
88    "I hope you're not to destroy the circle, for the whole government would soon collapse. There are twelve inhabited
89 provinces on Kadan. The leaders all meet regularly at a secret, neutral location to attend to planetwide and offplanet
90 matters. This is the Circle of Twelve. All the leaders of the provinces are accomplished conjurers, and very
91 powerful."
92    After a couple hours of strategic questioning he had a fairly good idea what Kadan was like. He was amazed. It
93 didn't sound like the boring place that she had mentioned when they first met. Finally he asked, "Do you plan on going
94 back?"
95    "Eventually. I'll have to settle down some day. This adventuring isn't nearly as much fun as I thought it'd
96 be."
97    "Not with me it ain't. I'm a well-known screwup. Hang around with me and Murphy's law is gonna getcha sooner or
98 later."
99    "Murphy's law?"
100    "'Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong, and at the worst possible time' I could probably add a few extra details to
101 it."
102    "Oh. So could I. Anyway, I've told you my story, now it's your turn."
103    "Huh?"
104    "Fair's fair. I want to know just exactly who YOU are."
105    James groaned.

161 If you don't like bo(A)rder thieves, then create a unique border that no one
162 but a real klutz would be cheap enough to 'steal', and be secure in knowing
163 that it is yours, and is identified by the recognizable content, and not the
164 usually rambling vaccuousness of boardborrowers. [*=*] [*=*]
165 It was warm in Tucson, and the peace and quiet of the Hilton on Miracle Mile
166 was a pleasant change from the open hostility of everything that was NewYork Cit
167 y. He had had a very enjoyable day, visiting old haunts like the BumSteer on
168 North Stone Ave, and the University area, the old Merlins Pub, a college crowd
169 place. He reflected all this, and the events in NewYork. He remembered, almost
170 verbatum, the words of his instructors at 'spy schol'. "People who have worked
171 in banks for a while become indifferent to handling large amounts of cash."
172 "It is the same with salesmen in jewellery stores;wen it's time to close, 
173 all they want to do is go home after a long day." They take the items from the
174 display windows like men unloading bags of cement. If you miss one, thats the
175 way it goes"
176 "It may take a few days, but eventually, you will find that a careless clerk has
177 left a very valuable item in the window. Passersby don't notice this, because
178 they expect the windows to be empty..."
179 It took two days. The store was in lower Manhattan, not that far from the 
180 wineodom of the Bowery. 
181 No one in Manhattan 'sees' anything. When Delta Five parked the stolen painters
182 truck, and placed the ladder against the wall, no one noticed. 
183 He climbed up to the alarm bell, and squirted the cans of packaging foam inside
184 the steel box. It hardened in seconds. The bell was silenced. He put the ladder
185 back on the truck, and went off for a beer;killing time till it was darker.
186    After a Budweiser or two, he went back. They were still there, 5 rings in a
187 tray, left in the window. He took the hammer and smashed the window, and snatche
188 d the rings. The timing was perfect. The firecrackes he had taped to the windows
189 of several nearby stores with cigarette fuses had gone off, and, breaking the
190 glass, set off the alarms. The cops would be busy...
191 Trotting around the corner, he quickly reversed his jacket so it was now bright
192 red, instead of Navy blue. Walking quickly, he put the rings in the cigarette
193 pack, with the brown paper wrapped around it, and the stamps in place, and 
194 dropped it in a mailbox. 
195 Two days later, it was in the Postoffice box he had rented a few days before
196 and after visiting his friend in Brooklyn again, he had 35 thousand bucks 
197 in his pocket. 
198 He lay back and sipped his Budweiser, and wondered how the "City of New York"
199 would react to his 'deal': "This guy Pervis seems to think 20 million NewYorkers
200 are out to get me. "Well, Mr. Koch, If that many people want to kill me, then
201 why shouldn't I kill all of them?"
202 "The information you now have will prove conclusively that if I arrange to
203 expose the 'good citizens' of NewYork to the botulisms I have in my posession,
204 I can do exactly that. Let us see if Mr. Pervis wants me bad enough to kill
205 20 million innocent people" In other words, this guy Pervis is about to committ
206 genocide. Dead people can not vote, Mr. Mayor. " Should I hear from Mr. Pervis
207 again, then you know what to expect"
208 
209 Delta V slept peacefully that night.

243 Sure we all have to get the work done, a lot of people have teachers that
244 couldn't care if you were there or not, deadlines make the world go 'round.
245 But what about all of the things that you do while you are not at school or

247 fun times that you have had and all that are to come.  If you pull the plug
248 now you will be cutting something short that was meant to continue, live on.
249 This isn't the time to end, it's the time to be merry.  Go out and do something
250 nice for yourself!  Go see a show, go dancing, meet new people, find some new
251 freinds.  I know it's easier said than done, but if you don't try it can never
252 be.  SO TRY!  Play a little game with yourself.  Say that you will meet 3 new
253 people every day.  And every day smile or say hi to as many people as possible.
254 You'll find out that people will say hi and smile back.  Just TRY for a while.

283 One Long Saturday...
284     (Part 1)
285      
286      10 AM Saturday morning. Jim Miller's head felt like somebody had set off an M-80 in it and the room kept slowly
287 spinning but he knew that if he didn't get up and get something in his stomach, he'd be ruined for the rest of the day.
288 That must have been some party. He wished he could remember it.
289      He shuffled into the kitchen of his small, one-bedroom house, trying to make as little noise as possible. Thank
290 god he didn't have to go to work today. He couldn't have imagined anything worse than having to run the car-crusher in
291 his present condition.
292      He pulled out a loaf of bread to make toast. Well, it was a start. He reached into the bag and pulled out a piece.
293 It looked raw but felt suspiciously hard. How old was this stuff? He rapped the piece of bread on the counter and
294 stared at the chip it had taken out of the linoleum. It was so stale he could hammer nails with it. If not for the
295 preservatives it would have been a nice shade of fuzzy green by now. Jim's stomach recoiled at the image so he quit
296 thinking about it.
297      Disgusted, he flung the piece over his shoulder. The sound of breaking glass made him turn around. He had tossed
298 it a bit too hard, and instead of hitting the garbage can it had gone through the window. This was shaping up to be a
299 real swell day.
300      There was something strange, and Jim had to do a double-take before he could figure out what it was. Through the
301 window, which faced the field that passed for his back yard, he saw part of something made of gray metal. It looked
302 like someone had parked a car in his back there. He hadn't been that drunk, had he?
303      Wincing at the bright sunlight, he stared out for a better view of the thing. His jaw suddenly dropped. No. It
304 couldn't be. Pulling open the back door, he ran out to confront the apparition.
305      It was a flying saucer.
306      It was about forty feet across, all made of silver metal, and stood on three legs, just like the one in 'Lost In
307 Space'. There was a ramp exending from the bottom of the ship, and by bending down and looking, he could see inside the
308 thing.
309      "Greetings, sentient."
310      Jim jumped so violently he cracked his head against the rim of the spaceship. Next thing he knew, he was lying on
311 his back, blinking away stars, and trying to think past a headache that had suddenly grown far too large for his skull
312 to contain. By the time he could see again, he almost wished he couldn't.
313      Standing next to him was what had to be one of the saucer's passengers. It was about three feet tall, and had
314 steely grey skin. It had two arms and legs and might have looked human except for the fact that it's head bulged
315 grotesquely above the eyes and it had no chin, making it look like a light bulb. The creature wore a skintight blue
316 uniform and was completely hairless, as far as Jim could see. All thoughts of a possible practical joke faded away.
317 Either that booze last night was a helluva lot stronger that he thought and he was having D.T.s, or he was about to
318 have a close encounter of the worst kind. He didn't know which hypothesis he preferred.
319      He sat up and gasped when he saw that there were more of them. Six, to be precise. As he stared around, the one
320 closest to him spoke again in unaccented english. "Are you injured? You became still so suddenly we feared you might
321 have terminated your life force."
322      Jim felt the bump on his head and said, "Uh, no. I'm all right. Who or what are you?"
323      The creature executed a complicated bow and declared, "Please accept our apologies for bad manners. We know very
324 little of earth culture. My designation is Amogo." it (he?) gestured around at the others. "These are my shipmates
325 Genis, Helak, Fodon, Sejit, and Mogon."
326      And I used to look forward to Saturdays, Jim thought wearily. "Well, let me extend greetings on behalf of planet
327 earth." He held out a hand and the little alien gravely shook it. His skin was cold, just like metal. "Let me guess,
328 you're here to give us the secrets of the universe, right?"
329      "Oh, no no no." protested Amogo. "We are an advance scout."
330      "Scout for what?" Jim asked, a little warily.
331      "Depending on the content of the report we return with, our empire intends to conquer and enslave this planet."
332

382 
383 3.  This  product  is provided "as is",  without warranty of  any 
384 kind,  including  but  not limited to the implied  warranties  of 
385 merchantability  and  fitness for a  given  purpose.  Should  the 
386 product  prove defective,  it is up to the purchaser to determine 
387 that  the  program  is defective and provide to  the  vendor  the

394 
395 5.  The  vendor agrees to provide techincal support at a scale of 
396 fees  to be determined once the vendor has written the  software. 
397 Such  technical  support  shall  consist  of  telephone   support 
398 conducted from an unlisted number in Malawi.  The vendor does not 
399 warrant that such support will be responsive,  or that any advice 
400 furnished  to the purchaser shall be correct,  complete,  or even

413 unauthorized  duplication  of  the  software  (even  for   backup 
414 purposes);  possession  of any program whose purpose is to defeat 
415 copy-protection  mechanisms;   advocacy  of  so-called  "consumer 
416 protection" legislation, which restricts the freedoms of software

418 vendor,  the program materials, any other products marketed by or 
419 endorsed by the vendor, or the software industry in general.
420 
421 8.  This  agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Republic 
422 of Albania,  and by the philosophy of its famous citizen  Mohamad 
423 Wassier.

451 John decided the spy biz wwas pure hell.
452 NEXUS had demoted him to field agent several weeks ago, and he'd been in
453 the retraining program ever since.  Yesterday, he finished.  NEXUS promptly
454 assigned him to the Delta V/NET affair- the last thing on earth he wanted to
455 be assigned to.
456 At least he still had his toolkit.  John had been allowed to keep it since
457 he had proven his skill with electronics long ago.  His masterpiece had been
458 the FD-78, the only completely self-motivated vehicle.  It had called itself
459 Fred.
460 The memory summoned up other thoughts that rose as ghosts would from their
461 graves.  If only UNDERGROUND hadn't found it necessary to sell it.  If only-
462 Damn that Farley!  The louse probably had run it off a cliff by now.
463 John composed himself, then looked out over the country he was passing over.
464 He could just make out the glow from New York's lights.  Soon the plane would
465 land.  Then, to find out what was so important about Delta V.  NET was
466 mixed in it somehow- maybe Parity, Fellows, and Farley.  John searched through
467 his toolkit and pulled out the modified welding laser.  Only two shots, then
468 back to projectile weapons.  I'll make do.
469 Farley was gonna suffer the world's first case of fatal heartburn.

480 THE THIN WISP OF SMOKE AGINST THE BACKDROP OF EVERGREENS WAS THE ONLY INDICATION
481 OF TROUBLE THAT AMAHL COULD SEE. YET, IT WAS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO TURN HIS FLOATER
482 TOWARDS THE FOREST. AS HE CAME OVER THE RISE, HE COULD JUST MAKE OUT THE IMAGE
483 OF TWISTED METAL AT THE EDGE OF THE TREES. THE FLOATER RUMBLED AS HE POURED ON
484 POWER FOR A QUICK PASS OVER THE WRECK. IT WOULD NOT BE HEALTHY TO LINGER NEAR A
485 FRESH WRECK, WHATEVER CAUSED IT MIGHT VERY WELL DECIDE TO DO THE SAME TO HIM. 
486 THE COMPUTER TRACKED CAMERAS WOULD TELL HIM JUST WHAT HAPPENED ANYWAY. 
487 SWEEPING OVER AT A COOL 450MPH, HE PASSED OVER THE WRECK AND A JET OF FLAME 
488 SPOUTED AFTER HIM, FOILED BY HIS SPEED. WELL, WHATEVER WAS DOWN THERE WASN'T 
489  IT JUST MIGHT NEED A FEW GAS BOMBS TO QUIET IT DOWN. OH WELL, WHY BOTHER? A 
490 LOOK AT THE CAMERAS TOLD HIM THAT A FIRE PLANT HAD SNAGGED SOME KIND OF SMALL
491 FLOATER, PROBABLY SOME YOUNG GUYS SOUPED UP RIG. FIREPLANTS OPERATED ON A 
492 COMPLEX PLUMBING ASSORTMENT IN SYMBOSIS WITH DECAY ORGANISMS. TRIGGERED BY 
493 MOTION, THEY SHOT A METHANE PRESSURIZED JET OF ALCOHOL, IGNITED BY SOME KIND OF
494 REACTION AT THE PLANTS TIP. ANYTHING MOVING NEAR A BIG ONE WAS IN FOR A HOT TIME
495 OF IT. HE WOULD GO BACK IN THE EVENING, WHEN THE PLANT HAD QUIETED DOWN.

499      Great  dred  fills  my heart as I step cautiously  upon  the 
500 small foot bridge.  The worn boards creak softly beneath my step. 
501 The worn timbers belied their inner strength.  Though they lacked 
502 the  external beauty of newly cut wood,  their strength was drawn 
503 from  the  winter  hardened woods  of  the  highlands.  They  had 
504 withstood the years of many feet, and would stand for many more.
505      I  stopped  at the railing.  How long ago had it been  since 
506 last I stood here? It seems like an eternity. It has been in many 
507 ways. How many friends have come this way? How many have gone? 
508      The wind ripples the water,  shattering the pure  reflection 
509 of  the moon as it shattered my thoughts.  I once met a friend in 
510 this  place while lost in the great dark forests.  But  where  is 
511 that  friend now?  The warm glow from the nearby Inn  momentarily 
512 shines  upon  the ground as a noisy group of patrons stumble  out 
513 the door. 
514      Releasing the railing,  I moved in the direction of the Inn, 
515 stoping at the sturdy oak tree outside the Inn, I admire how well 
516 it  has grown in the time I had last seen it.  Though its  leaves 
517 were gone in it's winter state, it still stood firm and proud. 
518      And  there  next to the oak...  the ever present Rowan  tree 
519 stood  tall and firm.  Ah the memories it  brought  out.  Quickly 
520 moving  to the Inn to avoid the tears that were welling up in  my 
521 eyes.  I  swung open the door to be greeted by a gust of warm air 
522 from  within  the Inn laden with smells and noise of  the  people 
523 within.  Firming my resolve, I step inside to see what has become 
524 of this place since last I had been here. 
525      Of  the Inn itself,  nothing had really changed.  Some of it 
526 the worse for wear, but largely still the Inn. But the people and 
527 the atmosphere,  there does seem a change there. No familar faces 
528 appeared  in  the  crowd,  and  the  happy  friendly  feeling  of 
529 companionship seems to be gone.  It is as if the Inn now  catered 
530 to mercenaries instead of adventurers. 
531      The  air  seems heavy and dark.  Where are the bright  happy 
532 faces redened by the glow of the fire that I once knew?

543   "Eleventh Floor. Weapons, armor, traps, bombs, thermonuclear devices." The
544 cool, sexless voice of the elevator chased Parity's daydream away, forcing his
545 attention to the now open sliding door, and the brightly lit hallway beyond.
546   "Please observe all safety precations." The door slid shut just as Parity
547 stepped out into the hall. Strategically placed signs pointed the way to the
548 various offices and laboratories on the 11th floor, but Parity ignored their
549 direction. He already knew which way he needed to go. Ian's instructions had
550 been clear enough. '...after discussing the reorganization with me, go to the
551 11th floor and wait for Agent Fellows. He will meet you at 1130 hours...'
552 Ian was always succint and to the point. Sometimes he was too succint.
553   Parity tore his gaze from the floor and stopped walking. He was standing
554 before an unmarked orange door. He took a key from his right front pocket,
555 unlocked and opened the door, and stepped inside. The door closed without
556 assistance. Parity replaced the key in his pocket and sat down in one of the
557 three chairs that occupied the otherwise sparse room. Parity looked up at
558 an electronic clock on the wall. It's LED readout said 9:30AM. He had two
559 hours to wait for agent Fellows. He knew the time would pass quickly.

572     To All And Sundry: Hello there!  It's nice to see my name in print again.
573     Ripple:  Greeting to ye!  Has anything interesting happened in An Tir 
574              since the War?  That was the last thing I attended.
575     About Reno:  My "gainful" employment was that of  Change Person; I was
576              catering to gamblers, envying the card dealers, and watching 
577              the prostitutes.  I came home broke, but with bills paid.
578     I have seen a lot of old friends poke their heads into the Inn lately,
579 and it is fun to see what they have to say and what they've been doing.
580 (Sheep dip indeed...)  This is my favorite way to spend an evening...
581     968: When I was in high school, I felt the same way you do (or did when
582 you wrote).  It took me 3 years on my own and a second try at college to 
583 show me that there really are people out there that think the way you do 
584 and appreciate the same things you do.  Never give up on anything - even
585 yourself - just because no one seems to care.  You are you, or whateveritis
586 is special to you, and if other people can't appreciate that, #$@%&* them.
