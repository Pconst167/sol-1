9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system. As the system is
10 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
11 I may find offensive. Because of the limited size of the system, it will be

20 L'HOMME: There are 3 more archive disks ready. Will be present at at PCS
21 social. Note that since we are no longer using Aarons disks, There will be
22 a price increase to $5 per disk. (I will be most happy to drop back to $4
23 if someone supplies the blank disks. As noted, each disk will come with 
24 6 BWMS files on it instead of the previous 5 or 6 that was on the 8 inch
25 disks. The disks are MSDOS format DSDD (Ver 2 format). Line numbers are
26 provided, with a tag line indicating the total number of lines in each 
27 file, Deleted lines are truly deleted (no skipped line numbers), all control
28 characters are left in except for the control Z which is stripped out.
29 The header (LIST, FILE ON, STATUS, ect..) is no longer provided. It starts
30 right off with "If you are in need of help...". Files are provided
31 in sequencial order by date. As a side note, the date on the file use
32 to be the removal date from the system. Since I started dating the files
33 (Line #2) the date now reflects the date that the disk was started. 
34 There was a transistion period of 2 disks in which I slowly advanced
35 the date to meet this criteria without having overlapping dates.
36 Leonard: Paper copy please! I would have to write a special program
37 to read 256 byte sectors. I can read 512 on my MSDOS machine, and
38 128 on my CPM machine, But I don't have anything that can read 256
39 directly, and that would mean writing a program down at the controler
40 level to read it, and I just don't have time to do that just to
41 read the information. Paper will do fine for that. Still haven't 
42 gotten thru to CIS. Arghhh.

46 It was late as we look in on the Inn. The Innkeeper was
47 holding on to Pam's leg and pleading "Please don't leave,
48 Please don't leave me!" While Pam replied "But I'm not
49 going anywhere!" The Innkeeper still pleaded as if he
50 didn't even hear her response "Please don't leave." By
51 this time Pam was getting just a bit tired of it all,
52 and said once more "But, I've already told you, I'm not
53 going anywhere, why do you think I am?" The Innkeeper
54 seemed to finally hear her answer, as he replied "I don't
55 know, I just have this unnatural fear of you leaving the
56 Inn and leaving me with no one to clean the tables and
57 serve the customers." "But why do you fear this?" She
58 responds, "I've already told you I'm not leaving. Now
59 will you please let go of my leg so I can go home!"
60 "Please don't leave me!" responds the Innkeeper. (Oh, no,
61 not again) Thinks Pam as she tries to move towards the
62 door dragging the Innkeeper along who was still clutching
63 her leg. "Please don't go!" He cries, while Pam just sighs...
64 It would be quite comical if it wasn't all so pitiful.

83 Leonard: What I was attempting to ask, without being obvious, was
84 did you remember Francis X. MacHinery as a character from They Shall Have Stars?
85 I've read a lot of books, most of them more than once (but not 20!), 
86 and unless the character is particularly memorable, like Valentine Michael Smith
87 or Jim DiGriz, it's doubtful I remember them for long.  Of course, I'm sure that
88 others have more efficient on-line storage devices, but given the size
89 of your library, your capacity can only be considered awesome.
90 For instance, to identify the pentagram story, I knew I had read it relatively
91 recently, but could not recall name or author, so I started with the most
92 likely and began looking until I found it.  Not the most efficient DASD, I know.
93 (but hey, that's what computers are for.  Now all I have to do is program
94 it and enter all the data. ha.)

111    There is also a rather STRANGE security outfit in California (I think)

116     There is the story of the burglars who thought it was a joke & broke in
117 to one of these places. (a jewelry store). When the psecurity people arrived

139             So, we meet again, Mr. Bond...
140             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
141 PromeTHEUS:  What are you, anyway, a spy? And who's waiting for you on the 
142      plane, Robert Ludlum? (as we stike an eerie note)
143      Hey, De-ja vu!  I was just thinking about you 'the other day,' 
144    Honestly!  Yes, now I am quite certain that we have met before, and not
145    only once.  You were with an associate and were both awaiting the 
146    early hour rendezvous (say about 5 a.m.?) of the two others.
147      As they did not arrive in time, and seeing as my employer and other
148    compatriots were to have that private screening, my employer said some-
149    thing along the line of- 'well, why don't y'all come on in?'
150      Previous to that encounter, I believe we met at E.G., nextdoor to the
151    Bistro down the street form J.K.G's (not being too cryptic, am I?
152    I quite fancy being cryptic!) 
153      Also, yes to having met you on Tri-Met more than once. We had cookies,
154    and you mentioned something about your instructors not caring too much
155    for your current coat (along the line of 'too many pockets')
156      I feel that this should confirm my Identity, and would like to see you
157    again at the E.G. store or on the bus to Vancouver. I'm terribly sorry
158    to inform you that I will NOT be able to make it to any of the PorSFiS
159    meets in the very near future, so that pretty much leaves out getting to
160    see anyone from The INN. Drats. 
Unitl our next encounter...

175      The atmosphere of the Inn seemed somewhat subdued at the moment, or
176 perhaps a better word was poised. Mez knew this usually signaled a new flurry
177 of activity, just around the corner. Just then a strangely dressed individual
178 walked up and handed him a folded note.
179      "What's this?"
180      "Oh, just an answer or perhaps a question."
181      Mez looked up, thinking to inquire just what this Mobius like comment
182 might mean. Much to his surprise he found himself looking at an empty space.
183 Why is it people around the Inn keep vanishing like a 'will-o-the wisp'? Mez
184 unfolded the note and began to read...
185 
186      A Gypsy was having a quarrel with his son. He said to the boy:
187      "You lazy,  do-nothing idler!  How many times shall I tell you
188      that you should work  and not let your life pass in indolence?
189      How many times shall I tell you that you should learn juggling
190      and clowning so that you can enjoy your life?"
191      Then he raised his finger  in threat,  saying:  "By God if you
192      don't listen  to my words  any more  I'll throw you in school;
193      then you'll gather lots of stupid knowledge,  become a learned
194      man, and spend the rest of your life in want and misery."

198 P.S. Sondargaard: Cryptic indeed! Perhaps it's caused by too much exposure
199    to arc lamp radiation, or are they using QH lamps these days. One of my
200    many means of survival in this incarnation once included a stint as a
201    theater projectionist, but that was long ago and far away. ---Mez

231      The flying blue smurfs ignored Omar as he slipped into the Inn.  He
232 was a tiny, furtive man with shifting eyes and a nervous tic.  He spotted
233 Salazar almost immediately and went straight to his table.
234      "Sir, you'd better leave now.  They are almost here."  Omar said as
235 he sat down.
236      "How many and how soon?"  Salazar asked.
237      "Five... they should be at the Rowan tree by now."
238      "You'd better leave then.  This isn't your fight."
239      "But sir, there are too many.  They'll kill you."
240      Salazar smiled grimly.  "I'm tired of running and even they would not
241 commit violence within the Inn.  Go... Now."
242      Omar shrugged his shoulders and melted into the crowd.  Salazar
243 signaled the barmaid, "Cognac, please."  As he waited for his drink, Salazar
244 thought about the message from the Net, a playful warning with a word of 
245 truth.  He had been careless lately, old age perhaps.  He hoped there would 
246 be peace with the Net.  Amadeus was a big enough problem.
247      The door to the Inn swung open.  Five men in gray and black robes
248 entered.  They were men of the desert.  Four were big, all muscle and sinew.
249 The leader was small and wirey with cruel black eyes.  The muscle men spread
250 around the room, covering the exits.  The leader made his way to Salazar's 
251 table and sat down.
252      "Ah, Mister Salazar... I see we finally meet.  My name is Abdul.  
253 Amadeus sends his regards."
254      "You must have me confused with someone else."  Salazar said innocently
255 .  "The name's  J.J. Newberry and brushes are my game."
256      "Cut the B.S., Salazar.  I want the key.  I'll kill you here and now if
257 I have to."
258      "You won't kill me here.  Violence isn't allowed in the Inn."
259      A sinister gleam came into Abdul's eyes.  "We do not recognize the
260 Covenent.  We will do what we want here.  You're dead meat, Salazar."  Abdul
261 started to reach within his robes.  Salazar started to reach for his gun.
262      "Hold it right there, Buckwheat.  We'll have no killing within the Inn.
263   A large, tanned figure shrouded in white muslin stood behind Abdul.  A 
264 long, curved blade pricked the center of his back.  Abdul swallowed hard.
265      Salazar smiled.  "Mohammed, nice to see you again."
266      "And you too, Salazar.  Getting a little careless aren't you?"
267      "Yeah,"  Salazar chuckled.  "That's the second time today I've heard 
268 that."
269      "Mohammed Wassir, this isn't your concern.  My men will kill you, too."
270 Abdul said.
271      "Men...?  Salazar, do you see any men?"  Mohammed said.  Abdul looked
272 around.  His men were gone.  Fear replaced the cruelty in his eyes.
273     Salazar smiled at Abdul.  "I think it's time you took a hike.  Tell
274 Amadeus that the key is mine, and not for his evil purposes."
275      Abdul rose.  "You'll regret this... both of you." He walked to the door
276      Mohammed watched him leave, then turned to Salazar.  "Let's get out of 
277 here.  He'll be back."
278      "No. Sit down.  I'm waiting for a couple of people."
279      "Who?"
280      "Leroy McKane for one."
281      Mohammed snorted and rolled his eyes.  "Who else?"
282      "The Lady Pam."
283      "I should have known."  Mohammed laughed and slapped the table.  "You
284 always did think she was cute."
285      "Knock it off."  Salazar said as his face reddened.
286      "Okay... now what about this mysterious key?"  Mohammed asked as he sat
287      "Well, it's a very special key.  A key to a tomb..."

340 With all the talk about Dune and Buckaroo Bonzai, there is a very good movie
341 that has been overlooked -- 2010: Odyseey Two.  There's been a lot of talk
342 recently about depth of plot.  Well, 2001 definately left alot of things to
343 figure out, perhaps too much.  2010 will not only be a sequal but will also

354                         What's Good for the Goose...
355 
356         The beach was lovely this time of year. The Oregon coast was
357 considered by native Oregonian and out-of-state visitor alike to be
358 one of the most beautiful unspoiled examples of nature's ability to
359 create the spectacular around. While the height of the tourist season
360 was during the summer, there were still some who were attracted to the
361 stark vistas the coast offered during the winter.
362         I was one of these people who enjoyed the solitude the winter
363 coast could offer. Time to think; about love, life, and other eternally
364 burning questions that never ceased to bang about in what my friends
365 called my overactive mind.
366         "Overactive indeed! Can I help it if I'm high strung? Is it my 
367 fault that my mind never rests? What would they have me be? Comatose?
368 No! I'm glad that's the way I am. I won't change. Why should I?"
369         It was during one of these rationalizing sessions that I spotted
370 the bottle. Oh I didn't realize it was a bottle at first, only a glint in
371 the wet sand where the tide was going out. I was walking alone along one of
372 my favorite wintertime haunts, a stretch of beach about 5 miles outside of
373 Nehalem, where very few souls ventured, and I was always assured the 
374 solitude I desired. The sky was overcast, as usual, but it was not raining
375 at the time. I didn't really care, being a twenty-year veteran of Oregon
376 weather, the rain had ceased to bother me long ago. As I approached the
377 glint, barely visible in the semi-subdued light, I saw that it took on
378 a curved shape. This was no piece of glass, no broken pop bottle. Only after
379 exhuming it from its half-buried position in the sand, and wiping it off
380 with the sleeve of my wind breaker, did I realize what I had found.
381         This was no ordinary bottle, to be sure. This was something
382 special. It didn't take an expert in antiques to see that this bottle
383 was very old, either. They just don't make'em like this anymore, I 
384 thought while admiring the intricate handwork that adorned the exterior
385 of the bottle in bizarre, oriental-like patterns. It was made of what
386 appeared to be copper; shiny, and lacking the usual green oxidation that
387 accompanied objects exposed to the elements for any length of time.
388 Maybe this washed ashore from a ship. A ship out there, I thought,
389 looking out across the cold, rolling breakers crashing on the sand,
390 then receding as if terrorized by my presence on this secluded beach.
391         The top of the bottle was capped with a large cork stopper. Of 
392 course I had to open it; it's human nature to investigate. The next few
393 moments are a little sketchy, not only by time but by the unbelievable
394 events that followed my investigation into the contents of my find.
395 Suffice it to say that I found myself seated none-too-comfortably on the
396 ground, with the bottle laying a few paces in front of me, and the cork
397 no where to be seen. Nothing so incredible about this? I forgot to mention
398 the 8-foot apparition that floated in front of me, about three feet off the
399 ground, a tiny wisp of smoke trailing to the bottle below.

402 Voyeur: Be sure to bring a couple blank disks to PCS.
403 Leonard: You should have come to the Tandy Computer Showcase at the Hilton today. Mine eyes have seen the future:
404 MSDOS,UNIX/XENIX/LANs/etc, and the past TRSDOS/MODEL 12/etc. If its multitasking you want, right now on my PC
405 I am running software that allows up to NINE jobs to be running simultaneously! One of those jobs can be a
406 terminal running at 9600 baud, and doing anything it wants with the PC except display color/graphics, or make
407 sound. Right now I am entering this message from an ADDS Regent 100, which is sitting on the kitchen table, while
408 the PC is running a text editor (ghost writing?). Now forget IBM, and imagine doing all of this on a Tandy 2000,
409 where everything moves about 3 times faster. You can put your BW emulator on one of the jobs, giving it small
410 time-slices, until someone calls, when it switches to a higher priority job, with bigger time slices. Sound neat?
411 Voyeur? Are you listening?
412 Kathy: I'll bring my adenture maps Saturday, if you still need help with the pirate's treasure.
413 G. Minsky: Thanks much, and please stop bringing all those mysterious people to PPS. You are ruining the image of the
414 place! haha
415 Mikey: The MSDOS disks sound fine. I'll have to check with the others about the money. I am kinda tapped at the
416 moment. Maybe leonard and voyeur can fill in the gap, both being employed at hi-tech computer related jobs...

418 L'homme: not only did I attend the showcase, I seem to have picked up a 
419 possible programming job out of it! 
420    I didn't get there 'til about 3:30. When did you leave? 
421    On a different subject, I downloaded some interesting info during my 
422 sessions on Delphi. The phone list included some cryptic notes (Vadic 3470?)
423 one was something about 2400? Gee, now we know what to use the Hayes 2400 on!

456 About half is the source to a term prog implementing the A protocol (with a

458 docs for VIDTEX. 
459         One warning, the list of escape sequences is FAR from complete. I'll
460 try to find the list I've compiled from various sources. 
461         I can tell you about ONE sequence though. ESC I is supposed to trigger
462 an auto-id, which includes a list of the VIDTEX options supported. 
463 Example: #RS233,CC,HC PB,CW
464 means Radio Shack 2 (model 3), Cursor Control,Hard Copy,B Protocol, Control width.
465 I've got a list of the "allowed" codes somewhere. The machine type is "optional".

481 without the proper punctuation, but I think I got the point across.

492      Hello friends, I started my Christmas shopping yesterday, after
493 buying some trinkets for friend and family, I stopped into a cards shop
494 to get some funny cards for friends far away. One particular card caught
495 my eye, strange but I knew I shouldn't pick it up, but damn it! I did!
496 The outside read some thing like this. "Inside there is a special little
497 message that I could only say to you." And when I opened the card the
498 message was simply "I Love You."
499      I winced in pain, memories of my summer of 81 came flooding back,
500 thinking about sharing, fun, climbing my first mountain with him. Oh
501 God I was such a fool. But indeed my love for him has never lost the
502 intensity of the very beginning. You would think after 3+ years of brok-
503 en promises and non commitment my faith would have faded. But no, It
504 seemes even stonger now. 
505      Later that evening, I has sorting out my wardrobe, throwing away
506 7+ pairs of shoes hat I hate, and a couple of boxes of clothes. I saw
507 a shoebox in the corner of the closet, and picked it up and took off
508 the lid. And I'll b damned if those same feelings of remorse didn't 
509 come right back to torment me again, for inside were "his" letters
510 to me, written after his return to school in the fall of 81. The sig-
511 nals of the beginning of the end. I was smart and didn't subject my-
512 self to the pain always associated with opening those old letters, and
513 thrust the lid back on and dropped the box like it was radioactive.
514 IEEEEEE.
515      And now you good people have become my shrink, my hands are shaking
516 and my pulse is high. I think it's high time I cleared out this old baggage
517 in the back of my mind. 
518      But, again, it was a hell of a summer.
519 **********************************kathy**************************************

521 sorry about the drivel, but I had it bundled up inside of me and it was
522 making me ill.

526 K;  Those certainly must be some strong emotions you have tied up inside to 
527   make you type your entry so early in the morning. I'm certain that I'm not
528   the only one that can tell you 'I know how you feel,'  if that's any con-
529   solation. Maybe not, but my experience was 3+ years that faded to friendship
530   after several long, dark months of tension. 
531     Now I too am shaking from a chill and will say 'Rest well, you are in
532   Good Company....'
533     Good night, and good morning...
