 58  By DAN CARMICHAEL
 59    WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A federal grand jury Friday returned a 10-count
 60 indictment against Clair George, formerly the third highest official of the CIA
 61 accusing him of perjury in trying to cover up the Iran-Contra scandal.
 62    George was the CIA's deputy director of operations from 1984 to 1987.s The
 63 indictment accuses him of perjury, false statements and obstruction in
 64 connection with congressional and grand jury investigations into the Iran-Contr
 65 sdl.
 66  
 67    Because George was such a high-ranking CIA official, the indictment raises
 68 new questions about the extent and nature of CIA knowledge of the worst scandal
 69 of Ronald Reagan's presidency.
 70  
 71    Another former top CIA official, Alan Fiers, pleaded guilty in July and bega
 72 cooperating with prosecutors. Fiers had testified before the grand jury that
 73 returned the indictment.
 74    Eight of the 10 charges against George stem from testimony he gave to three
 75 congressional committees in October and December 1986.
 76    The final two counts of the indictment, handed up to a federal magistrate at
 77 3:50 p.m. EDT, accuse him of obstruction and making false statements to a
 78 federal grand jury in April 1991.
 79    If convicted on all the charges, George faces a maximum sentence of 50 years
 80 in prison and fines of $2.5 million.
 81    George said in a statement, "This crisis, this indictment merely makes me a
 82 pawn in the continuing drama of political exploitation."
 83    For almost five years, special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh and his team of
 84 lawyers and investigators have conducted a criminal investigation of the
 85 scandal.
 86    The investigation hit paydirt early this summer with the guilty plea by
 87 Fiers, former chief of the CIA's Central American Task Force. Fiers pleaded
 88 guilty to two counts in the scandal and began cooperating with prosecutors.
 89  
 90    Fiers implicated George in the scandal. George, 61, was deputy director for
 91 CIA operations during the Iran-Contra affair -- in charge of the CIA's overseas
 92 spy operations and networks.
 93  
 94    Walsh has stated publicly that he has been investigating "a coverup in the
 95 CIA," leading to reports of increasing nervousness among senior officials of th
 96 aywith headquarters in suburban Langley, Va.
 97  
 98    George had a 32-year CIA career, but retired in November 1987 -- almost a
 99 year after the Iran-Contra scandal exploded into public view. He became a
100 security consultant.
101  
102    George told key members of Congress in 1986 that he knew little about Oliver
103 North's secret Contra supply operation. He also claimed he did not know about
104 the diversion of money from secret arms sales to Iran until it was publicly
105 disclosed in November 1986.
106  
107    Proceeds from the arms sales were wired to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels,
108 although Congress had outlawed such assistance.
109  
110    George told congressional investigators, "Whatever my strengths and
111 weaknesses, I was almost meglomaniacal in trying to prove one thing: that we
112 were not involved in that activity because it would have been illegal."
113  
114    But as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Fiers said he told Georg
115 a he diversion of arms profits several months before it became public.
116 Fiers said George ordered him to mislead Congress about the CIA's knowledge of
117 North's Contra operations.
118    A prosecution document filed when Fiers pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor
119 counts of withholding information from Congress suggested that George already
120 knew about the diversion when Fiers mentioned it to him.
121    According to that document, George responded to the information by saying:
122 "Now you are one of a handful of people who know about this."
123  
124    The accusations against top CIA officials also renew a series of questions
125 about President Bush's nomination of Robert Gates to head the CIA.
126  
127    Gates was deputy director of intelligence when the scandal became public and
128 members of Congress want to question him about his claim that he knew little
129 about it.
130    Hearings into the Gates nomination are scheduled to begin in mid- September.
131  
132    Former intelligence agents have described George as tough, a consummate
133 spymaster. But others said he had contempt for Congress, and his combative
134 personality and overriding penchant for secrecy mirrored the nature of William
135 Casey, the CIA director who died shortly after the Iran-Contra scandal became
136 public.
137  
138    Walsh's investigation has recently focused on whether CIA officials joined a
139 conspiracy to mislead Congress about their knowledge of the scandal.
140  
141    The grand jury also is believed to examining the role of Duane Clarridge,
142 another senior CIA official who once headed the agency's European division.
143  
144    The indictment of George is the 11th legal action brought by Walsh and the
145 third involving an official of the CIA. Many of the cases involved guilty pleas

220  I hope that others feel the same...
221 Alone...no one is alone in this world, or any other;
222      Our feelings get so wrapped up with our own worlds
223     sometimes we feel ignored or left out,
224      especially when we do things for others without recognition.
225     My rewards are painful impressions of silent reactions from those
226      whom I love with a deep respect.
227     More frustrating, yet, is that there exists no cure.
228      This is when I feel alone...and frustrated...
229 BUT, I believe that no one is alone.
230      Spiritually or physically, it seems like there is always 
231     someone there to help you out...I don't know why...
232      your guess is as good as mine!

239 Astral Dreamer...depends on what civilizations you count as having existed.
240 Depends on what history of the earth one is willing to consider. Depends on 
241 one's belief (as you mentioned) in other life on other places. Sometimes it 
242 seems to me that a belief that we are the only life form in all of a god's
243 creation is more absurd than the recognition that maybe life is not nearly
244 centric as we make it to be. I never limit what a god can do. And just
245 maybe it is possible that he doesn't like to lose something he puts a lot of
246 time and effort into and he'd rather it grow in understanding instead.
247 Each man chooses what he finds beauty in and some find the beauty in walking
248 back into a life and recognizing people we have walked with before as old
249 friends to love once again. A way of growing love so to speak because each
250 life we love them more.

256  
257 A question or two.  I have noticed both in myself and others a 
258 predisposition towards certain personality types.  Science seems to imply
259 that these are in fact genetic, and that atleast some portion of 
260 personality is inherited.  Would you please comment on this?

263 Next, how does one get in touch with these past lives.  I've read some
264 on the subject, but have yet to have any luck in this myself.  I

266 Thus,  if past lives exist, then the answer may be there.  (Not
267 to mention the solution to some problems.)

274 Astral dreamer, I can't help you on genetics and whether we are predisposed
275 to one discipline or another. I have seen no research on this. So I'll use
276 my own life....my sonher graduated from Cal Tech. His brother went to
277 MIT in computers. His other brother ended up in a computer career. All 
278 three sons were scientifically oriented. Now...my own son....he is good at
279 math, science, music, art and writing. The science disposition is still 
280 there but it is not where he wishes to pursue a career. I was good in 
281 scien, math, art and a fair hand at writing. My son wants to be a teacher
282 he thinks, using none of his skills in a career specific manner. Could
283 genetics play a part? Yes. On the other hand I know this kid from other 
284 lives....what I see in him is what I have known him for in those lives. The
285 ribald sense of humor, the sense of true caring for mankind, the guts to
286 stick to a task even though it is hard, the harshness upon himself for his
287 failings. Maybe we are a bit of both. He chose his parents before this
288 birth, I remember agreements with the people I was born with that are old
289 friends this time to come here together. Perhaps he chose people of like 
290 interests to his own, I do not know. Perhaps genetically it was available
291 to him because his father and I chose who we were to be born to?
292   
293 Some questions I cannot answer. I know only of my own memories and those
294 of my child and my friends. We remember things other people do not and
295 have talked of them with each other. Confirming specific times and places
296 and details that we have shared.
297   
298 Ultimately each man chooses what concepts they pursue in life. And my path
299 has been to pursue one that general society does not accept in this country.
300 In another country there would be no question that this concept was a viable
301 one. All I know is that my life is far more whole and complete having that
302 knowledge than if I had been without it.

311 Jessie, those are more or less the answers I was expecting.  I guess it
312 makes sense that we all have our own paths to tread.
313  
314 I don't remember having lived any past lives myself, though I do sometimes
315 find myself having an affinity for certain people.  I have also noticed
316 that there is a tendancy for my life to follow some sort of a logical
317 progression.  Sometimes its wierd how it works.  
318  
319 As my alias indicates, dreams are a major area of fascination for me.
320 I almost believe that some sort of communication outside of my own 
321 head goes on.  I can remember a number of dreams where I heard or
322 experianced things that were outside my own domain.  I also have
323 had several very short dreams of the future.  Never anything 
324 important, just 2 or 3 second snippets that later give me a 
325 sense of deja-vu.  Generally these happen 6 months to a year
326 before they become true.  The implications of this tend to
327 worry me, as I do not believe in predestination.  (Just 
328 predisposition.)  I believe it is possible that I have 
329 many others that do not come true, and thus I do not 
330 remember them.

343     Dreams are the greatest product of the imagination--

355 Astral Dreamer, do you know there are many types of dreams that humans
356 have? Besides dreams that work out problems in our lives or turn over things
357 we need to deal with in life...there are things called lucid dreams. One
358 becomes aware in the dream one  is dreaming. You are awake inside a dream
359 and can manipulate it. Deja Vu dreams are common and people will find them-
360 selves walking through a situation they dreamed about. We also have dreams
361 of places we have been before, we can meet people we know that we are to
362 find in a dream...the list is long.
363   
364 My experience is that if I find an attraction to a person in life 
365 immediately, here usually is a reason that turns up later.ften I know
366 them from the past. What the peramiters of mankind are is fascinating.
367 And the more we explore how varied those peramiters are, the more our lives
368 have a richness to them. I can see why you would be interested in this
369 aspect of your life.

373 Jessie, I have on occasion had lucid dreams.  I've found that my control
374 only extends to myself.  Other aspects of the dream continue to 
375 act independently of my will.  This used to annoy me a great deal,
376 but I have for the most part come to terms with it.  
377  
378 I sort of suspect that the world we life in is just a shadow world,  
379 A stage upon which we play our parts.  In dreams I suspect we
380 grasp some small part of the place were the plays are written.
381  
382 Or perhaps not.  Time or death will tell.

436 Hello. I have many dreams about planes and plane crashes. I think this
437 is because I have a real phobia of flying. It was learned when I was
438 about 8 or 9 years old and was in a crash landing in Hawaii. Must've
439 really set in and developed because I haven't flown since and refuse to
440 fly completely...(I've even taken greyhound for 34 hours from school
441 and had the toilet overflow..and, being above the engine, it smelled 
442 like hot piss the whole way!! :) was terrible!...the train is beautiful
443 though. Even if I wasn't afraid of flying I'd probably still take the
444 train.
445 (oh BTW it wasn't me who made the toilet overflow...I only used the
446 restroom at stops..and they weren't much better :P Yuk!
447 I also dream about flying (like Superman) a lot...except it is really hard
448 to do it at first and I have to try really hard. Then it gets easier but
449 it only lasts for a little while and soon I'm down on the ground again
450 trying to fly but can't do it. It's frustrating and annoying! :)
451 I don't really have nightmares anymore...they are so fascinating. I kind
452 of miss having them. Every once in a while I'll have one but they're
453 never as bad as when I was a kid.

458 A Real Experience...
459  
460 Out on my own, all alone
461      in the shadows of the moon and stars
462     I walked through the knee-high grass
463      growing in the sand.
464 The wind blew at my face, and the chill of Fall was very near;
465      as I followed an abandoned trail,
466     I could hear the thundering waves hitting the beach.
467 I reached a cliff (ten feet high)
468      that a overlooked a scenery so beautiful,
469     it sent a warm chill down from head to toe.
470 The moon lit the night to shine a peaceful light
471      on everything below.
472 The clouds slid across the evening sky
473      like a balloon on ice;
474     and beyond the clouds,
475      the heavens shown through with greatness.
476 Every star and planet was visible to the naked eye,
477      and they sparkled like diamonds on black velvet.
478 Together with the wind in my face,
479      and the sense of complete freedom from reality,
480     I absorbed the sound of the ocean's power
481      with the silent beauty of the heavens above.
482 I have never experienced anything like it before,
483      nature's most peaceful bliss in my eyes.

644 BCCI/Oct Surprise: Castalero Killing Source: Peacenet
645  
646 On a Saturday in August '91, reporter Joseph Danial Caselero was found dead in 
647 a hotel room in the Sheraton in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  His death was 
648 ruled a suicide and his body was embalmed the next day.  His family was angry 
649 that the embalming was ordered before they were notified. 
650  
651 Casalero's investigations may have been about to tie together the October 
652 Surprise, BCCI, Reagan adminstration officials, and INSLAW software piracy 
653 case.  The latter is an eight-year court case in which the computer firm, 
654 INSLAW, has accused the Justice Department of stealing its software.  
655  
656 Casalero had a theory about a network, allegedly led by an associate of former 
657 Attorney General Edwin Meese, that he called the "octopus".  The theory 
658 alleges that the "octopus" funneled money through BCCI to the Iranian 
659 government to keep the 52 American hostages from being released before the 
660 1980 presidential election.  The Republican campaign team believed that 
661 release could have been a decisive October surprise, giving Jimmy Carter the 
662 victory.  The theory alleges that as a reward, the "octopus" was allowed to 
663 sell INSLAW's software program to foreign governments, including Israel and 
664 Iraq. 
665  
666 Other reporters have explored the "octopus" theory, but Casalero alone claimed 
667 to be close to proving its existence and its connections to the Reagan and 
668 Bush adminstrations. 
669  
670 The media buried the story under leads touting Caslero's financial situation 
671 as a likely motive for suicide.  The coroners said that his death "was not 
672 inconsistent with suicide".  The FBI investigation amounted to a two hour 
673 interview with the local police, after which they announced that there was no 
674 reason to investigate further. 
675  
676 "Here you have a case of a man who told friends and confidants he was on the 
677 brink of proving the involvment of the Justice Department in possible criminal 
678 activity and nothing further is done," former Attorney General Elliot 
679 Richardson said.  "I do not see how someone in a responsible position can let 
680 a thing like this stand," Richardson said refering to the FBI decision to not 
681 investigate further. 
682  
683 What was mentioned in only two newspaper reports of twelve this reporter could 
684 find, was that Casalero had been receiving phone calls threatening his life, 
685 warning him to back off of his investigation.  And only one source quoted his 
686 mother saying that just days before his death he told her, "If there is an 
687 accident resulting in my death, don't believe it." 
688  
689 In a related devolpment British journalist, Anson Ng Yong, was found shot to 
690 death in Guatemala, where he'd been investigating Guatemalean army generals 
691 involvment to BCCI. 
692                                                                              
693 Somethings to think about as you listen to the reports on the confirmation
694 hearings for Bush's choice to head the CIA, a man who should have been aware
695 of the entire sordid affair.  Either he is dishonest, or incompetent.  Not
696 good choices for the man heading the Central Intellegence Agency.  The folks
697 who were too busy running drugs, and selling arms to notice the falling of the
698 Communist government that had been their primary focus since  World War II.
699 Incompetence or dishonesty.  George Bush's man, alright.  And Ollie North is
700 a hero for getting off on a Constitutional technicality.  That's right, the
701 same Constitution towards which he showed so little respect, and tried so
702 desparately to subvert, saved his ass.  Irany...I mean irony, at it's finest.
703

705 Manuel Noriega and Saddam Hussein are the enemy?

807 A recent observation today...
808      about life in general and the games people play.
809 I was watching a show (CLUB MTV),
810      which had dancing, and music, and plenty to see.
811 The leaders of tomorrow were flying around,
812      with the bare essentials, and sex abound.
813 As I examined them carefully, I curiously thought,
814      about the present and future going to pot!
815 Sometimes I think that I am out of place,
816      in this "liberal" society and its revealing tastes.
817 But not with this, which I am deeply concerned,
818      about children that were taught, but never learned.
819 There are so many traditions, and cultures lost,
820      with common courtesies that seem to be tossed.
821 "Give them an inch, and they'll take it a mile,"
822      as they sit in their chairs with an innocent smile.
823 Parents need to spend more time with their kids,
824      not the TV with so many zr"vids"...
825 I love life more than anyone can guess,
826      maybe that's why I feel it's a mess...

842 What I'd like to know, is why some people think the Oregonian is 
843 liberal.  Check out the headlines in fridays paper.  We had the 
844 "Loyal 800" who showed up to see Bush and Packwood, and then 
845 we had the "400" people who showed up to demonstate and riot. 
846 (Atleast thats what the oregonian said.)  Of course, I talked to
847 somebody who was there, and he claimed more then 800 people were 
848 there to demonstrate.  So, what we have is an under reporting
849 of the number of people there, a very slanted article on what
850 went on (Emphasizing the rioting, which was a small group of 
851 people, and had nothing to do with the main part of the demonstrations.)
852 Plus a glowing description of the Bush supporters and the terrible 
853 ordeal they went thru to get in.  (Havn't they ever heard about that
854 old adage,  ...names may never hurt me?)
855  
856 In the same paper they talk about the Govenors visit to Pendlton, (I
857 believe thats right)  Anyway, Shes trying to get a consensus on what
858 needs to be done to overhaul the tax system here in oregon.  So what does
859 the oregonian report?  A rather tepid description of her purpose, followed 
860 by nothing but quotes from people who are up for lettin the state go
861 under financially, with nothing from the other side.

869               You got it right.  Packwood, and the wealthy Republicans pay zero
870 for the opportunity to raise more than $500,000 (That's a half a million big
871 ones), while the taxpayers foot the bill for police overtime (the same police
872 that don't have time anymore to respond to theft reports and other miscellaneou
873 crimes).  Not to mention tying up the Banfield AND MAX during Thursday morning
874 rush hour.  Who are these people anyway who get away with such arrogance?
875 Can YOU afford $600 for a meal?  Can YOU afford $600 for anything but a
876 neccessity?  Can YOU afford to re-elect Bob Packwood?  A man who has embraced
877 everything that the Reagan/Bush Empire stands for?  (And he gives Bush a
878 tree seedling...want to bet it never got planted anywhere and rotted in the
879 pot?)  Who owns who?  Does Packwood represent Oregon interests?  Or the out
880 of state money lords who want to cut down all the trees and export them 
881 instead of keeping jobs processing them into lumber in the U.S.?  And what
882 about all the money Packwood receives from the other out of state interests
883 that are so concerned with whether or not he gets re-elected?  Do you think
884 YOUR concerns are theirs?   Over 1/2 million dollars in less than two hours.

892 Well, speaking about politics gets me cornfused, but, here I go...
893  
894 Having a major bureaucracy (the US govt) costs the people of the US major
895 bucks.  Not to mention all of the minor bureaucracies in between the
896 White House and your local city government.  I do believe we are being taxed
897 unfairly to this vary day and I have evidence (first-hand info. from prior
898 experience with working for the government) prove it.  Medical, education, and
899 a secure standard of living are the three main priorities I would like to see
900 our government tackle.
901 Recently, I spoke with a middle-aged woman who was born and raised in Holland,
902 which is currently a socialistic country.  According to our conversation, the
903 standard of living there is extremely secure.  Education, medical and 
904 government services are all paid for.  I was amazed!!!  I asked her how this 
905 was possible -- she said that there was approximately a 30% deduction out of
906 paycheck and that was it -- no taxes to pay at the end of the year.
907 So, I asked myself why we have an average of 25% taken out of our paycheck at
054=Usr:609 Doctor Duran Dur  09/21/91 22:25  Msg:6517 Call:37391 Lines:43
908 and we still have to pay federal and state income taxes at the end of the year.
909 Not to mention the fact that we end up paying bucks through the ass for all
910 different kinds of insurance (I don't want to EVEN get started on insurance!).
911 Then we have house payments, etc.  To tell you the truth, our government IS
912 getting the best out of us.  'Not to much to say about that, really.
913  
914 So, my question is: why aren't we heading towards socialism at a faster
915 momentum???  Because, the people who are in power now (who have all the money)
916 DO NOT want to lose any more power than they have to.  This "NEW WORLD ORDER"
917 thing is bad news -- if you like to read the bible occasionally, pick it up
918 and read about what the Lord thinks about it.  I'll tell you anyway...
919 the "NEW WORLD ORDER" has to do with the consolidation of power and control
920 into one ruler and king over all the continents of the world.  Satan's dream
921 is to rule the entire world.  Supposedly, there will come an ANTI-CHRIST 
922 (who will say he is Jesus coming back for the last time) who will lead a
923 majority to believe in him that he is Jesus (when he's really not) and he will
924 become a very powerful political leader -- eventually becoming THE LEADER of
925 this "NEW WORLD ORDER".  For a short time, there will be a world peace --
926 where no wars will be fought, then, soonafter, all hell will break loose!!!
927  
928 So, I'm not to crazy about this "NEW WORLD ORDER" thing, it really scares me.
929 Another part of trivia -- people say Satan's number is 666.  Well, a lot of
930 people believe that number means that Satan will have complete control over the
931 world through the use of numbers -- i.e., what's your social security number;
932 or, your driver's license number; or, your credit card numbers; or, your bank
933 account numbers -- the principal behind it is that everyone will be known as
934 a number instead of a name (Satan's # happens to be 666).
935  
936 It really doesn't sound too stupid when you think about it all -- it just gets
937 really scary.
938  
939 As far as politics are concerned, I think we can eliminate a few hundred 
940 bureaucracies (AT LEAST), and start focussing our attention on more valuable
941 resources on the "home-front", like our children for instance.
942  
943 We still do live in one of the richest countries in the world, though, and
944 I am very thankful for that!!!  Simple things, like indoor plumbing and nice
945 roads to drive on are very scarce in most parts of the world.  Not to mention
946 our freedom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

952  
953 Time to finish off the disk.  
954  
955 I'm currently of the opinion that humanity is programmed to self 
956 destruct.  Follow my logic if you will.
957  
958 We all have an ego.  Now, this in and of itself is not bad.  It makes
959 us what we are.  Individuals, beings with free will.  Thats the upside.
960  
961 The downside is the self deception we use to maintain our egos.  This
962 self deception is built in.  It is a survival mechanism.  Without it
963 we would be forced to commit personality suicide, and death (In any 
964 form) is amoung our greatest fears.
965  
966 So, if I am correct, then we are stuck in a system were we cannot succede
967 beyond a very inefiant level.  
968  
969 Has anyone ever wondered why it took us so long to get to this point? 
970 (Speaking in terms of understanding the universe and the technology
971 that leads to and comes from said understanding.)  Could it be because 
972 any idiot can get lucky eventually?
973  
974 Of course, I can of course postulate that we may if fact learn to 
975 overcome this built in liability.  But should we?  What are we now?
976 What would we become?  Do we have the courage?
977  
978 "We are stubborn built up places
979 Built close but apart.
980 Two walls that crumble and merge
981 time will wear apart
982 Casting shadows we are alone
983 moving closer?"
984  
985 Be aware of the filters on your ears and eyes.  They may blind 
986 and deafen you at times, but that is the least of their dangers.
987 It is worse when they manipulate and twist the things you hear
988 and see.
