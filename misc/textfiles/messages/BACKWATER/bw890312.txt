 24 Well I'm at the top again.

 28      Patrick woke up early the next morning. He went out to the kitchen and 
 29 got himself some breakfast. Back in his room he sat the toast and juice down an
 30 removed the note that Brian had left him from his desk. 
 31      Again he examined the symbol closly. It too seemed to move and go out of 
 32 focus, much like the symbols that Patrick had seen on the chalk board. Once it 
 33 came into focus and he almost said a word. But he chocked on a piece of 
 34 toast as he was about to mutter it.
 35      His Breakfast finished Patrick returned the plate to the Kitchen and washe
 36 it off. His Grandmother was up and he greeted her before returning to his room.
 37      Being Sunday he had the rest of the day off. He could read a book,
 38 go to the library or play with his Computer. There was a board or two he'd
 39 like to call...
 40      No, there was really only one thing to do. He had to go back to the Inn.
 41 At the very least he should try to ascertain wether or not the Wanderer was
 42 alright. As he had done the day before he prepared his pack. The inside was
 43 now dry, and he left the books in just in case he should need the added 
 44 boyancy. Since he didn't want to make his Grandmother suspiciose he placed
 45 the robe inside the pack along with the orb and the parchment paper that
 46 Brian had left him. He opened the window and set the staff against the wall 
 47 below it.
 48      "Grandma, I'm going out back. I might go to the library or somthing
 49 later on." Patrick said feeling guilty about the lie.
 50      "Ok, will you be in for lunch?"
 51      "I'm not sure. I'd better go grab somthing out of the fridge just in
 52 case."
 53      He went into the Kitchen and pulled the stuff out of the Fridge that he 
 54 had not eaten the day before. 
 55      "Hello Cymry, want to come along?" Cymry wagged his tail in greeting and 
 56 followed Patrick out the sliding door. He retrieved the staff and started on 
 57 his trip.
 58      The Inn was the way he remembered it. Being more familier with the 
 59 routine this time he simply walked in. It wasn't as loud as it had been
 60 when he had viseted the previose day. Patrick looked around for the Wanderer, 
 61 but he didn't seem to be around.
 62      Takeing a table by a wall he sat back to observe. As he had 
 63 noticed the previose day the people in the Inn wore many different styles
 64 of clothing. Strangly he had no problem understanding most of what they
 65 were saying, though an occasional snipet of unintelligable 
 66 conversation would drift over to him. Cymry sat at his side dozzing. The
 67 Shepherd seemed to feel safe.
 68      "Hello Patrick." Said a voice startling him out of his reverie.
 69      Patrick turned and found the Wanderer seated in the chair beside him. "I
 70 didn't even see you. Were did you come from?"
 71      The Wanderer smiled. "From the air my friend."
 72      "I thought you might have been hurt or somthing. When I uttered the rune 
 73 Brian,Cymry and myself were transported to my bedroom. You were nowere to be 
 74 seen."
 75      "Yes,you caused me a bit of trouble there, Lets just say I too returned 
 76 home. I would appreciate it if you would not use that rune while I'm around. It
 77 has an unpleasent effect on me."
 78      "I don't even remember it."
 79      "It will return to you. I've been told that once you use a rune it
 80 stays in the mind. It does take time to recharge. With your lack of skill
 81 it could take a long time before you again remember it."
 82      Patrick tried again to picture the rune. "I can't remember it now." 
 83 He paused. "I suppose it might be usefull to return home whenever I wanted to."
 84      "Perhaps, remember though that it is often unwise to let others know
 85 were you come from. Home is a very preciose place." 
 86      "I suppose. Were do you come from?"
 87      "I can't tell you that I'm afraid. Though I believe you have a clue or
 88 two already."
 89      Patrick shrugged. "Earth?"
 90      The Wanderer shrugged. "Perhaps. I notice you are not wearing your robes
 91 today. Did you bring them with you?"
 92      "Yes they're in my pack."
 93      "Good, Always carry anything with you that you might need. Never assume 
 94 that you will be able to return somewere to retrieve somthing of value."
 95      "Patrick! there you are, were the heck are we?" 
 96      Patrick turned and was shocked to see his best friend William standing
 97 beside him.

107 If you want to know more about Innisfall, you should consult a Keeper
108 of the Archives when he has his electronic tomes in full array about him.
109 Lacking that, I still believe it is possible to buy into the Archives-
110 it is about 18 megabytes of history.  For a very short summary, I
111 suppose my own memory will suffice; I am sure any old-timers will correct
112 me in any particulars if I err.
113 To begin- Innisfall is the name of the land that the Inn resided.  The
114 Inn was a starting place for adventures, a place to hold civilized debate
115 and good conversation, and a place to just pass the time with good friends.
116 People who lurked there were known as Innhabitants or Innklings, depending
117 upon to whom you spoke.  The Inn itself is nestled within a small valley.
118 A path ran near the front door, running from a hidden pass to the outside
119 world to a footbridge that spanned a small stream.  Many ducks and other
120 waterfowl played and lived in a small pond downstream from the bridge.
121 A large Rowan tree shades the large oaken door.  Fine stables behind the
122 Inn house the steeds of visitors.
123 Upon entering, a visitor walks into the Commons area.  Tables are scattered
124 haphazardly about.  The lighting is rather dark, except near the large
125 hearth.  A semicircle of comfortable chairs surround the hearth, and there
126 always seems to be room for one more.  The atmosphere is relaxing on the
127 whole, despite the tendency for odd happenings and strange goings-on (such
128 as people appearing and disappearing into thin air).
129 The Innkeeper takes orders for fine food and drink from a counter that
130 streches across most of the back wall.  A staircase leads to the guest
131 rooms on the second floor.  Another door leads to a hallway which provides
132 access to the kitchen, pantry, and a back room.  Another staircase leads
133 down from the hallway to the wine cellar, which also contains a few
134 surprises the Innkeeper keeps tucked away.
135 This picture of the Inn was built up in my mind by the many tales told
136 here on BWMS; among those responsible are the Innkeeper, Piper, Voyeur,
137 the Bard, L'homme sans Parity, the Ninja, Fast Fred, Pam, and others too
138 numerous to mention.  It was not the only view of the universe in which
139 contributors wrote; another prominent example was the adventure-packed
140 world of the NET:  super-spies whose efforts kept peace in an unstable
141 world.  Their names are also legion- Ian MacHinery, Joshua, L'homme,
142 Gaudy Minsky, Petrov, Mohammed Wassir, Farley, Flemming, McKane...
143 Choose whatever world you wish to write in.  Make one of your own if you
144 prefer, the multiverse is rich in adventure.  Above all, enjoy!

147         Finding a dealer of coins wasn't difficult.  The city was laid
148 out in an orderly fashion; quite unlike Dunbarrah where the natives get
149 lost.  It was a little shop with a spry little proprietor who looked at
150 our tokens with great interest.  They caused my fingers to tingle, as
151 they always did.
152         "Gold, are they?" he chuckled.  "It's been quite a while since I've
153 seen the like here.  Used to be common, long ago.  Now..." he trailed off.
154         "We'd like to sell them if we could, sir.  Would you be interested
155 in offering a fair price?"  Fortunately for us, he did not know we'd take
156 any offer he made.  We were at somewhat of a disadvantage, not knowing
157 the value of the local currency.
158         "What- you want to SELL them?"  A bright smile lit up his face
159 for a moment, then a frown darkened it.  "I'm afraid I can't offer much."
160         "What can you offer?"
161         "Er...um...one hundred."
162         "One hundred?"
163         "Each, of course."  We had shown him eight tokens.
164         I smiled.  "Sold, sir.  One hundred times eight, if you would."  I
165 handed him the coins.
166         The shopkeeper's eyes widened.  "Tokens!" he cried as he touched
167 them.  "There's no mistaking that feeling.  Where did you boys obtain
168 these coins?"
169         I could think of no reply other than the truth.  "These are our
170 allowance from the School of Magick in Dunbarrah, sir."
171         "Dunbarrah!  Well, welcome to Earth, boys.  I hadn't recognized
172 your tokens, it has been so long since I've been home.  I'll give you the
173 fair exchange rate if you still want to sell them."
174         "You're from Dunbarrah?" asked Merryl.
175         "Migrated here long ago.  Fond of technology, that's why I moved.
176 There's other problems that come along with it but I get by.  I still have
177 a bit o' magick to rely on if things get rough.  Some punks tried to rob me
178 about a month ago; they suffered sudden existence failure."
179         "We're trying to return to Dunbarrah.  We got here my mistake- a
180 miscast spell.  Do you know where a Power source is?"
181         The shopkeeper smiled.  "Yes, I do.  You got sucked in here by
182 Power, huh?  That'll happen.  Okay, I'll tell you.  There is a large slab
183 of stone in the South Park blocks, moved there by the city.  Of course,
184 they didn't know it used to be a worship-stone long ago.  It radiates a
185 lot of Power."
186         "Tell us how to get there?"

190 And alas another day will pass. And all of the tension will subside, into the
191 dark that is the night.
192  
193 Though it may seem like a principle it is only really your inner self, fighting
194 with the shell with which you surround yourself. True feelings are very rare.
195  
196 The foundation is a small grey stone. It is somtimes cold to the touch and 
197 somtimes warm. But it is always there holding up that which sits so 
198 precariosly above it. 
199  
200 You can feel it if you try. Reaching out is so hard somtimes. The Poet
201 can never be sure wether a vision is simply an illusion or a truth that is
202 hidden.
203  
204 The forrest in its greeness is as we all are. The shadow under the trees
205 will always harbor somthing to make us nervouse. And this is as it should
206 be. To be to sure of ones self is to be a fool. Always doubt but feel 
207 secure in the knowledge that your doubt brings you strength.
208  
209 The roundness of the earth is inself an illusion. Though I to would like to
210 think that it is a truth. For is the earth not speckled with the mountains
211 and valleys that make it so much more the a sphere? 
212  
213 Each feature may bring back a memory and even the smallest things are 
214 beutifull in some way. Symetry.
215  
216 Below the sky is were we all reside. Perhaps some day we will travel out ane
217  there discover more wonders. The scale at which you view things is a 
218 reflection as well. May we all be kind in whatever scale we care to see.

222 Powell's book store last Thursday.  It really pissed me off because he was
223 only there from 12:00 to 1:30.  Although he did read some of the funnier
224 bits from Life, the Universe, and Everything.  He was promoting his new book,
225 'The Long, Dark, Tea-Time of the Soul.  The title incidentially is found in
226 the first chapter of 'Life, the Universe, and Everything.'  I had him sign
227 my omnibus edition of Hitchhikers, and both the Dirk Gently books.

301  THE QUIET REVOLUTION
302  
303 The Quiet Revolution is  a systematic grass-roots educational campaign whose 
304 purpose is to cultivate awareness of the ways in which our personal decisions 
305 collectively shape our world. 
306  
307 Each person impinges on his or her society, species, and biosphere in six 
308 ways: spending money, earning or investing money, voting, using resources, 
309 relating  to others, and paying taxes. Of these, five are largely or wholly a 
310 matter of personal choice. 
311  
312 The Quiet Revolution  is based on the premise that the Earth can be saved--our 
313 terminal global cancer can be cured--to the exact extent we each take personal 
314 responsibility for the Earth in all of our decisions. The basic maxim is this: 
315 Make all choices on the basis of what promotes the health, competence, and 
316 adaptive flexibility of self, society, species, and biosphere. 
317  
318 Specifically, this translates into the following:
319  
320 Good Buy: Cultivate awareness of the personal and systemic effects of your 
321 spending habits. Before you purchase anything, ask yourself three questions: 
322 (1) Where is most of the money for this thing going? (i.e. to support the 
323 local economy and/or sustainable enterprise, or to enrich the polluters and 
324 exploiters) (2) What good  is this thing to me? (Is it a tool, conducive to my 
325 health, competence, and flexibility--or is it an addiction, conducive to 
326 momentary self-gratification at others' expense?) (3) Does this purchase 
327 constitute a responsible use of the Earth's resources? 
328  
329 Good Work: Cultivate awareness of the personal and systemic effects of your 
330 livelihood. Before you take a job or make a decision about your career, ask 
331 yourself to what degree it is slavery  (squandering your vital energies for 
332 someone else's vested interests that may be detrimental to the health of the 
333 planet) or work  (doing what you are best at for the best interests of self, 
334 society, species, and biosphere). 
335  
336 Good Will: Cultivate an awareness of the personal and systemic effects of your 
337 interactions with others: those you love, work with, compete against, do 
338 business with, or involve yourself with in any way. "Do unto others as you 
339 would have them do unto you," whether the "other" is your lover, your cat, a 
340 skid row derelict, a wilderness area, or the Earth herself. This has never 
341 been improved upon as the central axiom of enlightened personal and planetary 
342 ethics. 
343  
344 To the exact extent that people apply these principles--acting on the basis of 
345 what is best for self, society, species, and biosphere simultaneously--to 
346 every nontrivial decision they make--what to buy, where to work, how to 
347 relate--the Earth will be transformed into a healthy and balanced planet once 
348 again. --sponsored by Oregon Gaia Institute

370 Milch, I know what you mean,its just that I get frustrated easily. I like the
371 idea of the quiet revolution, I wonder if it stands a chance?
372  
373 VISION, thanks for the praise, my head is begining to swell. I'm not sure
374 I'll be able to get out of my room without getting it stuck in the door frame
375 :-+) (Mustachiod smiley.)
376  
377 On the subject of people stealing this. What I enter here is generaly a first
378 draft. I have made many changes to the earlier stuff and you may notice that 
379 the story has continued to evolve. When it is fully done I will print it
380 all out. This is my third or so attempt at writting a novel, I hope this one
381 will succede. If I could find somebody with a Commodore 128 I could get them 
382 to copy my last attempt over. I think I was around 100k into that one. Which
383 is a bit more then 2 times as much as I have done on Patricks tale.
384  
385 I don't seem to be able to write in anything other then Novel length. Well,
386 eugh of this rambling, on to part 14.
387  
388       "How did you get here?"
389       "Well, actually I came over to apologize. Your Grandmother told me
390 you were in the back yard. I didn't see you but I thought you might be 
391 hiding in the dog house or somthing." William finally noticed Cymry. "Wow,
392 Cymrys back! Excellent. Were did he come from?" He bent down to scratch 
393 Cymry behind his ears.
394       "You came over to apologize?"
395       "Yeah, I've been a bit of an ass lately. I'm afraid since I found
396 out how good I am at sports I've gotten a bit big headed."
397       Patrick and William had been best friends since grade school. They had 
398 both been about average height untill last summer. William had started a 
399 late but substantial growth at that time. Patrick figured him to be around
400 6'2 and 220 pounds now. It was needless to say a difficult change to get used 
401 to.
402       "Yes, you have been avoiding me lately."
403       "Well, untill this year, and try not to be to offended by this, we've
404 been geeks. I mean most of the girls wouldn't give either of us a sideways
405 glance. So suddenly I'm stud athlete, I'm afraid I didn't handle it very 
406 well."
407       "What brought all this on?"
408       "I'd be lying if I didn't say I've been having a great time, But I got
409 out my picture album for the heck of it and started looking through it. And
410 I realized that we'd had some great times before I was ever populer. Your
411 about the only person I know who likes me because of who I was, Not because of
412 what I have become."
413       Patrick looked at this giant, and for the first time in a long time 
414 he saw the friend he had known for so many years. He smiled and held out his
415 hand. "Friends again then?"
416       William smiled back and shock Patricks hand. "Friends, So were the heck 
417 are we? One minute I'm walking towards Cymrys dog house and the next I see this
418 big wooden building. I couldn't see your house anywere so I walked up and 
419 knocked, somebody let me in and I noticed you over here sitting with some
420 hippy type... Say were did that guy go?"
421        Patrick looked around and found the Wanderers chair empty. "He seems
422 to have a habit of dissapering. You'de better sit down, this is sort of a 
423 long story."
424        An hour later Patrick had finished running through all that had 
425 happened to him so far. 
426        "Pixies and Treants? Why didn't you tell me about this stuff?" William 
427 paused for a moment. "Heck we've been in your back yard hundreds of times
428 and I never noticed any of that stuff."
429        "Thats why I didn't tell you. I seemed to be the only one who could
430 see it. For all I knew everybody had these sorts of things in their back 
431 yards. Since nobody talked about it though I kept quite. I remember telling 
432 my mother about it when I was a kid, She'd just smile and tell me I was 
433 cute."
434        "Yeah, I see what you mean. Say why don't we go back to your house.
435 This all makes me sort of nervouse."
436        "Sure." he said motioning for Cymry to follow.
437        They got up and made their ways out of the Inn. Outside Patrick
438 looked around and then waited. 
439        "Which way is home?" William asked him.
440        "It ussually just appears. when I want to go there. I don't remember it
441 taking this long before."
442        They waited for fifteen minutes. Finally William voiced their worst
443 fear. "Patrick, I don't think we're going to be going home as soon as we 
444 thought we would be.

452 my interests include (but are not limited to): cross-country skiing, dancing,
453 photography, writing, reading, drawing, and traveling. currently i'm working
454 on my private pilot's license and next week i hope to start learning tai-chi.
455  
456 i work as both a hardware and software engineer but am beginning to think that
457 i what i really want to do is architecture. i like the people aspects of
458 computers but i don't make the technical side my life (read: i'm not a nerd :-)
459  
460 re: AD and his impatient side. first let me say that i currently like the
461 atmosphere here as is. if you find this board too slow perhaps you should
462 also check out other boards? that way, things could take their natural course
463 here and you would be in touch with more folks. i like the blue parrot and
464 jd's place...
465  
466 does anyone suffer from writer's block? the version that is afflicting me
467 currently is that basically i am a perfectionist. when/if i have a stroy
468 (i mean, story) in my head, i can get impatient with my (seemingly) in-
469 ability to communicate it *exactly* the way it is in my head. i suppose
470 the best way to get around that is to just practice and possible revise
471 when i feel some important details are missing...
472  
473 one final word on "stealing ideas". give a roomful of writers a storyline
474 or plot and virtually no two stories will be identical. i could take the
475 story of patrick and tell it my way but chances are, i would wander off in
476 another direction or perhaps develop patrick in a different way, etc. i
477 have taken two creative writing classes (different teachers) where the first
478 was real particular about 'protecting ideas' and the second was not. the 
479 class was set up as a workshop - every student got a copy of everybody eles's
480 (argh! that's else's) work to critique. in the first class we had to return
481 each copy to the author. i had wanted to use them to practice and revise
482 after hearing the critiques or use the basic storyline to tell a story my
483 way. in the second class, the teacher *encouraged* exactly that. usually not
484 to copy the whole story line but to answer the question: what if he/she did
485 that instead or if this happened, etc. i think you get my point (if there ever
486 was one :-)

489 Hello alyx. Re: my impatiance. Sorry if I seem a bit neurotic about that. I
490 tend to get uptight if nothing interesting happens for more then 24
491 hours.
492 When I got here last summer things were much more active. Of course we also
493 had to put up with some stiwt, but that is the price you pay.
494  
495 I just joined up over at jd's place, I'm not sure I've been validated as I
496 can't enter messages. I'm also on Blue Parrot under my real name.
497  
498 I've noticed that very little writting is going on. This is true on all the
499 writting oriented BBS's in town that I have found. 
500  
501 As far as writters block goes, I get it only when I'm really busy or in a
502 bad mood. As far as perfection goes I don't worry to much about it on
503 a first draft which is what I upload here. I try to make things as good
504 as possible in that first draft but I realize I'm going to have to go back
505 and change parts of the story later.
506  
507 I'm not worried about people stealing my ideas, They are really not that
508 origional. The only thing I really worry about is somebody taking one of
509 my stories, correcting the spelling and then saying it is theirs.
510  
511 Hopefully I'll be able to afford a real WP soon. right now I use a text
512 editor that has no spell checker, thesaures etc. As you may have noticed
513 I really do need these tools.
514  
515 Well, enough for now. I'll upload the next part of my story tonight.

528 Ok , heres the next part. ACTION!
529  
530         They stood awhile longer before returning to the Inn. They returned to
531 their table. 
532      "Hey, whats that?" William said noticing a small brown pouch on the 
533 table. Beside it was a scroll. 
534      "Looks like its for me." Patrick said noting his name on the outside of
535 the scroll. He opened it up. It was a note from the Wanderer.
536      "Sorry to have left so suddenly,I had business elsewere. You will 
537 find contained in the pouch 40 gold pieces. Use them wisely. You should be 
538 able to stay in the Inn tonight, there is a large common room upstairs 
539 that will serve your purpose. 
540      Oh, I'm not sure who closed your doorway, It is not within my power to
541 open it either I'm afraid. Good luck to you and your friend William. 
542                         
543                          May your Journeys be long and prosperouse ones,
544                                             the Wanderer."
545  
546      William had been reading over Patrick shoulder and now reached out and
547 lifted the pouch from the table. when he opened it he saw the golden coins 
548 that the note had spocken of. They were roughly dime sized. He pulled one
549 out and looked at it. On one side it showed an ingraving the Inn, on the
550 other side it said "This coin is legal tender for all things within the 
551 land of Innisfall." these words cirled a small crescent on which many 
552 intricate and hard to identify symbols were etched. He handed the pouch to
553 Patrick. "Mind if I keep this one?"
554      Patrick dumped the coins out on the table. "We'd better split them up
555 evenly, In case we get seperated..."
556      William nodded solemnly.
557      They devided up the coins and placed them in their pockets.
558      "My mother is going to kill me." William noted after they had sat silently
559 at the table for awhile.
560      "I'm really sorry about getting you into this."
561      William stared moodily out into the center of the common area of the Inn 
562 for a moment. He looked back at Patrick. "No, its not your fault. If I hadn't
563 been such an ass recently I wouldn't have had to come over to apologize. Its
564 sort of poetic justice. but What do we do now?"
565      "I'm not sure, if I could get us to Brians school of magic we might be
566 able to get some help from him. I don't know how to get there through the lake
567 though." He paused and pounded his fist on the table.(Cymry looked up at him.)
568  "If I could only remember that symbol I used to get home from Brians School. 
569 we'd be back in my room."
570      They sat in silence again untill William spoke. "I'm getting kind'of 
571 hungry, why don't we have somthing to eat?" 
572      Patrick sighed and smiled at his friend. The guy could eat twice as much a
573 him and not even blink an eye. "Pardon me, am old we order somthing
574 t a? arc sed the barmaid when she next passed there table.
575    h mlda hem "somthing, what would you like?"
576    Give me a double burger and fries. Oh, and a large root bear if you 
577 have it." William answered.
578      "And you sir?"
579      "Oh, I'll just have some apple pie if you have it."
580      "Certainly, I'll be back in just a bit." She said walking back to towards
581 the kitchen.
582      "Wow, she was good looking." Noted William.
583      "Huh? Oh yeah, I suppose." Patrick replied.
584      "You're begining to worry me buddy. Show some interest man. Your nearly
585 17 years old."
586      Patrick began to turn pink. "Look," He said unsteadilly, "Just because
587 I don't pant at every pretty girl..."
588      "Women." William corrected.
589      "...Ok, Women that walks by that doesn't mean I'm strange or anything."
590      "Ok, Ok relax. I was just teasing you."
591      Cymry began nudging Patrick in the side. "Whats then matter boy?" He
592 asked the dog.
593      "I don't think he needs to go, He went when we went outside earlier."
594 William reminded him.
595      Just then Patrick again noticed the little silver tube on Cymrys coller.
596 He reached out and touched it.
597      "Maybe he's just hun... shit!" William Said as Patrick slumped to the
598 ground.
599  
600      
601 Whoops, Looks like a bit of munging. Basicly patrick asked the waitres if
602 she would take his order and she said she would be glad to.

678 Hagbard:  I was recounting what the Inn WAS like.  When BWMS II came
679 on-line, most of the stories revolved around the great change of the
680 multiverse.  The Inn as it existed then was destroyed.  However, if one
681 traverses the spheres long enough, its like may be found once more.
682 AD:  I forget what the going rate is to buy into the Archives (it decreases
683 as more people buy in; the money you pay is divided among those who have
684 already purchased it)... but I am sure it can be arranged.  It exists on
685 many different formats- MS-DOS, TRS-DOS, cartridge & 9-track tapes  (I
686 still smile at that one!).  I don't believe anyone has tried to print the
687 whole thing out yet (18 megs? about 3400 pages?)...
688 AD:  After thinking about it for a bit, I believe the current low-level
689 of activity is due to the lack of multi-authored stories.  There are
690 problems with maintaining such, but they do produce a lot of creative
691 writing!

717  
718      Say good bye to baseball, sports fans.  If we don't, it may mean the end o
719 life as we know it on earth.
720      This year, the baseball bat industry expects to sell more than 2,300,000
721 wooden baseball bats.  That translates to about 250,000 trees.  Yes, in 1989
722 alone, baseball will reduce our planet's capability to absorb carbon dioxide an
723 produce oxygen by at least a quarter of a million trees.  That figure of course
724 does not include the trees that bite the dust for the sake of baseball progrqms
'25 newspaper pages devoted to the sport, and paper cups for the beer, not to
726 mention the annual Swimsuit Issue of Sports Illustrated (which may not be
727 influenced by baseball so much as by another sport).
728  
729      Without those trees< scientists tell us, the amount of carbon dioxide in
730 our atmosphere will increase.  And with the rise in carbon dioxide level comes
731 the dreaded...

733      We used to think of greenhouses as pleasand< sguet-smelling, lush oases in
734 the cold barrenness of winter.  No more.  This greenhouse is going to kill us,
735 we're told.  How?  Well, with all that carbon dioxide, sunlight gets through to
736 warm the earth, which in turn heats the atmosphere< but infrared radiation is
737 absorbed by the carbon dioxide, so the heat doesn't dissipate by radiation into
738 space.  Got that?  Before too many years go by, the earth's atmosphere heats up
739 and we die.
740      Don't panic yet.  Halting the }anufacture of baseball bats won't help an
741 awful lot.  That's because there are other problems. A lot more trees are cut t
742 clear land for agriculture (such as South American cattle raising).  And, the
743 real big sources of carbon dioxide are txe industrial burning of wood and
744 petroleum products and respiration by humans and other animals.  Burning is
745 especially bad, because it releases particulate matter into the atmosphere, and
746 that increases the density of clouds and the inability ov the atmosphere to
747 transmit light and heat from the sun to the earth.  And you know what that
748 means: global cooling and the dreaded...
749  
750                       Perpetual Winter
751      Yes, scientists tell us that this pollution gyll sause temperatures to
752 drop, which will increase the size of the polar ice caps and cause currently
753 temperate areas to become agriculturally unproductive and even uninhabitable --
754 another ice age.  Got that?  Before too many years go by,0dhe earth's atmospher
755 cools down and we die.
756      Don't panic yet.  The scientists who believe in greenhouses are still
757 fighting with those who prefer the idea of a perpetual winter, and the earth is
758 waiting to see which side can yell the loudest.
759  
760      Until recently, it appeared that the greenhouse fans were gaining.  In
761 fact, this group of scientists became so sure of themselves that they decided
762 they could afford to spend a little time to check their theory against txe data
763 they have been accumulating during the last century.  They wanted to pin down
764 the rate of temperature increase so they could tell us exactly how long we have
765 before human life (and baseball) perishes.
766      What did they find?  Nt much.  They started by checking temperature 
767 statistics for the United States over the last century and found that there is 
768 no indication of any warming or cooling trend.  The scholars were shocked and 
769 dismayed -- no evidence that the end of life is near.  How disappointing.  But 
770 scientists are not easily discouraged, and they came up with two reasonable 
771 explanations.  First, their data may not be any good.  Scientists like to 
772 throw out their data when the numbers don't support their views.  And second, 
773 just in case no one believes that the scientists have been collecting bad 
774 numbers, they hypothesize that the U.S. may be a special case, a "local" 
775 climate, an anomaly surrounded by a warming earth.  Qfter all, they explain, 
776 the most significant changes caused by the greenhouse effect would be seen at 
777 the poles and in the tropics. 
778      So the scientists looked at the poles and the tropics. Nothing.  Things
779 seem pretty much the same as they were centuries ago.
780  
781      What does this all mean?
782  
783      It means that baseball may not destroy life after all, even if it does
784 severely interfere with TV schedules.  And the baseball bat industry is doing
785 its pard by converting to aluminum bats, cutting the production of wooden bats
786 by about 75 percent over the last 15 years.  They would do even better if
787 aluminum bats were legal in professional baseball.
788      Are you breathing easier?
789  
790 0    Don't.  Clearing all those forests in South America will give a needed sho
791 in the arm to the economies of several countries by allowing them to expand
792 their cattle industries and increase the production of beef, which (scientists
793 tell uc9 insreases the level of serum cholesterol.  Before too many years go by
794 our arteries clog up and we die.

802 Interesting stuff above. Life will kill you too. Maybe the earth will jusd
8 3 get tired of all of us humen types and swallow us up. And the we would die.
804      Milchar, A Multi-Author story would be nice. But the format I would like
805 to follow would be like the Thieves world series. My current story is
806 connected0do the Inn. Many others could be as well. The Inn would be the
807 'common element.' 
808 Well, here is part 16. More tommorow.

810      Again he floated above the table with0the crystal ball. This time the
811 girl who had come through the door was sitting in a chair by the table.
812      "Anji!" Patrick said, now recognizing her.
813      "Ah, you know me! I look different when I am not 9 inches tall I suppose."
81$0She0added sadly "Of course I also lost my wings." 
815      "What does all this mean?" Patrick asked her.
816      "You are in great danger!"
817      "Of what?"
818      She shook her head. "I cannot go into details now. You must hide."
819      "Hyde? Gilliam and I can't return home."
820      "Yes, that is unfortunate. It was a hard decision, but we had to close
821 the gate. Somehow William got sucked in when it happened. We are deeply sorry."
822      "Sorry, who are you? Who are 'we'."
823      Anji frowned. "I cannot tell you that."
824      "Ughh!"
825      "Your Cute when you're angry." She said, her cheeks dimpling as she 
826 smiled.
827      Patrick began to feel himself fade. 
828      Anji noticed. "You should not contact me agai~ to0soon. The disturbance
829 will be noted by Acerik."
830      "Acerik?"
831      But it was to late. With a sudden jolt Patrick was back in the Inn.
832      "Pat Buddy! Your awake. What happened?"
833      "Huh? Oh, I... could you help me sit up/" William helped him into a chair.
834      He sat gasping. 
835      "Are you sure your okay?"
836      Patrick took a deep breath."Yeah, I'm alright." He explained to William
837 what had happened.
838     "Sorry we can't return home? Great.You know, It is begining to look like 
040=Usr:84 Michael Miller j  03/16/89 23:51  Msg:3399 Call:19425  Lines:56
839 somthing really deep is going on here."
840      "Yeah, the adventure of a life time." Patrick yawned and looked at his
841 watch. "Great, its onli noon and I feel like sleeping.
842      "Noon? Oh yeah, the waitress brought the food after you passed out.
843 Whan't some?"
844      "No thanks, you can have the Pie as well. I think I'm going to go to 
845 bed." 
846      "You sure your ok?"
8470     "Yes, just tired. I'll get a room for us."
848      "Ok, I'll be up as soon as I finish eating"
849      Patrick went over to the counter and talked to the Inn keeper. After
850 a short discussion he handed him one of the gold coins and recievud some
851 silver and copper ones in return.
852      "It's the second door on the left at the top of the stairs. I paid for
853 lunch as well." He walked tiredly towards the stairs. "Oh, you might want
854 to keep the pouch, I have the pack after al|."
(55      "What ever you say Pat. Take it easy dude."
856      Upstairs He opened the door and went inside. It was a fair sized room with
857 two beds, dressers and desks. Everything was neat and well kept. He managed to
858 stumble over to one of txe beds before falling asleep.
859      Sometime later he felt someone shake him. He opened his eyes to see 
860 William standing above him. 
861      "How you feeling?"
862      Patrick sat up and yawned. "Better. I just needed some rest."
863      "Dxatc0good, you had me worried. I was talking to some of the people
864 downstairs. Nice enough for the most part. Found out some interesting stuff."
865      "Such as."
866      "This Inn is located in a place known as Innisfall. It's supposed to be 
(67 fqirly peacfull. We're a good way out from any settlements. The lake is as
868 you said a gateway to many different worlds. Combat is rare and nearly 
869 unheard of in the Inn itself, though it can be a bit wild at times."
870      "Seems safe enouwh. Where is Cymry?"
871      "He's lying down by the other side of the bed. I got him some dinner and
872 let him do his business before I brought him up here."
873      "Good, I'd hate to lose him a second time."
874      "That lake must be an interesding place to go fishing."
875      Patrick smiled. "I'll bet, I wonder if anybody around here has tried 
876 that?"
877      "I saw the Innkeeper heading out with a pole just before I came up
878 here. Must have a fascinating collection of stuff."
8'9   0  Patrick nodded.
880      William walked over and sat down on the other bed. "So Pat, what do we do
881 now?"
882      "We wait I guess. I'm all out of ideas for now. Unless..."
883      "Yeah?"
884      "I still have the piece of parchment thad0Briqn gave me."
885      "Do you know what it does?"
886      "No, but it must be good for somthing."

956 Friar is still here.  I have been reading and watching and enjoying.  I am not
957 really a creative griter in any sort of useable way.  I synthesize and 
958 aggregate, but rarely do I write the fantasy type of stories in vogue at this
959 time on BWII.
960 I do enjoy reading most of the stories, though, and will continue to read them.
961 I am sure that0some of you will go on to be poets, journalists, novelists, as
962 a profession rather than an avocation.  Be wary that in becoming a profession
963 it does not lose its lustre as a reason for being.
964 I could never fly as a profession, because dxat ys not why I fly.  Sometimes I
965 think I would like to, but my inner self has always held me back from that.  
966 It seems I have a very wise inner self.  I fly now for the joy of it, for the
967 peace it brings to me, for the memories of other worldc and other times.  If I
968 *HAD* to do it, it would never be the same.  
969 The same is true of writing for many.  I have talked to authors who must keep
970 writing, to eat and sleep inside.  They begin, after a time, to resent being 
971 forced to be creative.  "It isn't a valve you can turn on and off!" more than
972 one writer has screamed at his/her publisher/editor.  Keep that in mind as you
973 choose, but remember that no choice is permanent and you are always free to
974 choose a diffurent future, or a different past.
975 Those of us who don't write value your offerings, we value the soul we see in 
976 them.  We value the beauty, and the truth, that is expressed there.  The beauty
977 and truth always is, but sometimes it takes a nudge in the right direction to
978 allow us to see it.  Keep putting your heart into it, and your heart will
979 become larger and larger, allowing more to be given.
980 Thank you for the writing, keep it up.
