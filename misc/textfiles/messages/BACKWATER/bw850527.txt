28       "Okay, now disconnect the, uh...the black thingy.  No, I said the BLACK
29  one!  Now pull the little square circuit board with the resistors and things
30  all over it."  Hansen turned the diagram around a couple times.  "A usual
31  MacHinery diagram.  I think I've been using it upside down, but I'm not sure."
32       Johnson had shut out Hansen's instructions two power supplies ago.
33  "I think I've got it all figured out, Hans.  I'm just about done."
34       "I don't care what you THINK Johnson.  If we botch this job Machinery will
35  see to it that we orbit up here for the rest of our short, miserable lives.
36  McKane didn't design weather satellites you know.  It's no accident we weren't
37  told exactly what these things do."
38       "Done!"  Johnson proclaimed, "let's put the cover on and get out of here."
39       Both men climbed back into the shuttle.  Hansen couldn't keep himself from
40  lecturing about the importance of the mission and about Johnson's general lack
41  of competence.  "This is more complex than a communication satellite.  Remember
42  the UPI job you screwed up?  Remember your stupid response?--'I know there's
43  some parts left over,' you said, 'but the satellite really doesn't need them!'
44  Ha!  You and your left-over parts. I just know something terrible will happen!"
45       Just then the one-sided conversation was interrupted by an urgent message
46  from Net headquarters.  "Signaling the Deussex...switching to new scramble
47  code...new setting is 475X-47Pj."  Johnson punched in the new code.  "I'm sorry
48  HQ, you'll have to insert another-"
49       Hansen grabbed the headset, "Come in Headquarters.  What's the trouble?"
50       "Uh...Deussex...you are ordered to refrain from any further operations
51  concerning the objective satellites."
52       "Who gave these orders, Walters?" demanded Hansen.
53       "That's all I have, Deussex...you are ordered to refrain-"
54       "Who is this?  Give me Walters or somebody!"  Hansen was becoming
55  increasingly hostile.  "I have to know on whose authority-"
56       Hansen was cut off by an authoritative voice which he recognized as Net
57  Space Agency Director Harold Pinkerton.  "Be quiet Hansen.  That UPI satellite
58  Johnson tampered with malfunctioned this morning.  It began sending some
59  strange signals and then aligned itself to the Tass receiver dish.  We finally
60  had to destroy the satellite."  Hansen and Johnson stared at each other in the
61  cold silence.  Pinkerton continued,  "If Johnson's doing the same stuff-"
62       Hansen interrupted, "I've been keeping an eye on Johnson, sir, we've
63  converted most of the satellites and I think we're in pretty good shape..."
64       The conversation continued but Johnson nemded to hear no more.  As the
65  shuttle plunged silently into the night Johnson looked at the handful of
66  satellite parts hidden in his pocket, and then back at the satellite
67  disappearing behind the smooth curvature of the Earth.  "Oops."
68 
69  ..........
70 
71       Pinkerton sat behind his desk.  The face of an angry Ian MacHinery filled
72  a visual monitor on the opposite side of the room.  "You tried to convert those
73  old McKane satellites without my consent?  Now what will you do, Pinkerton?"
74       "Sir, preliminary reports show that any attempt to contact the satellites
75  would cause a chain reaction that would most likely result in World War III and
76  a nuclear holocaust.  As you recall, McKane had planned to use the satellites
77  to control Soviet and US nuclear launch and tracking systems.  Now that they
78  are fully active but out of control, any use of the satmllites would be
79  disastrous.  We estimate a ninety-five percent probability of nuclear war."
80       "Again, Pinkerton, what do you propose to do?"
81       "A specialized team could repair the satellites."
82       "Men like Johnson?"
83       "No sir.  The satellites are more complicated than we had originally
84  suspected.  The computer has come up with the necessary team--no other
85  arrangement will do."  Pinkerton paused and shuffled some pages.
86       "Number one: Please take note of page five.  As you can see, located on
87  the inside panel of each satellite is a code which tells how to deactivate the
88  automatic destruct system which kicked in when Johnson revived the unit.
89       "I can't make heads nor tails of this code."  It was obviously a difficult
90  thing for MacHinery to admit.
91       Pinkerton continued, "It has something to do with pre-columbian art.
92  There's only one man who knows enough about the subject to decipher this code."
93       MacHinery smirked.  "L'homme sans Parity!"
94       "That's right sir.  Now let me see -- number two: A genius who helped
95  design the McKane satellites.  He's in prison now.
96       "What's his name?"
97       "Well, uh...um...we only know him as Crazy Charlie...uh, he sort of went
98  insane and killed a few people when the organization collapsed."
99       "Number three:"  Pinkerton didn't give his superior a chance to respond
100  to the Crazy Charlie thing, but he could see that MacHinery was smiling for
101  some reason.  "Number three is a man who is indirectly related to the
102  consdruction of the satellites.  Some of the parts Johnson used when altering
103  several of the satellites seem to have been purchased through the black market.
104  The devices have been tracked to a disassembled automobile last owned by a Mr.
105  Eugene Farley.  Farley is the only man who intimately understands those
106  instruments.  We must be careful, though.  Farley is known to be obsessed with
107  the memory of his lost car.  He could conceivably turn on the others in an
108  attempt to recover his electronics."
109       "Number four: Another former member of the McKane organization.  He worked
110  under Crazy Charlie and is the only other person we know of who worked on the
111  satellite project.  Aside from satellite repair, we hope he'll be able to keep
112  Crazy Charlie calm.  Charlie has a reputation of being somewhat unpredictable
113  and we need someone who can keep him under control.  His name is Petrov."
114       "Finally, number five: The leader of the expedition is an experienced
115  shuttle pilot named Hansen.  He should be able to keep order and-"
116       "No!"  MacHinery interrupted.  "The fifth member will be someone who
117  DESERVES to be locked up with a crazy man and a kinky Russian.  He's a man who
118  shouldn't laugh at his superiors or watch idly as I fall into a swimming pool."
119  An evil grin came across his face and he started to laugh.  "I don't doubt that
120  he'll finish the job -- it's just gratifying to know that I'll be making his
121  life miserable in the meantime.  I WANT JOSHUA."
122       Pinkerton watched as the video screen with MacHinery's laughing face
123  faded to blackness.  "Two Net agents, two former McKane agents, and a guy who
124  could betray them all for a few hubcaps, all trapped for a very long week in a
125  very small shuttle."  Pinkerton sighed and then hit a button on his desk.
126  "Walters, carry on with your orders.  Substitute Joshua for Hansen.  At all
127  costs you must round up L'homme, Crazy Charlie, Farley, Petrov, and Joshua.
128  Oh, and Walters -- get my bunker ready, will you?"

155    The mind of a human is a curious mixture of intellect and emotion.
156 Inextricably intertwined, these two forces pulse and burn, the tension of
157 their interaction somehow bringing forth sapience.  Let one overcome the
158 other and humanity vanishes.  What remains may look human, but lacks the
159 necessary spark to set it above the beasts.  Let intellect overpower emotion,
160 and we get the Holacaust of WWII -- with emotion gone humaninty is lost.
161 Let emotion take over at the expense of reason, and humanity is again lost.
162   Some individuals find their point of balance, their fulcrum of humanity,
163 closer to the emotional tides than others who find the cold tides of the
164 intellect comfortable, but all partake of both.  The piper had long been an
165 emotional person -- oh, he used his intellect, but sparingly.  In the long
166 forest night, screaming his loss to the uncaring stars, cursing the cold
167 moon who looked down on this tableau with an expressionless eye, the hot
168 tides of emotion washed him off his point of balance.  What toppled into the
169 underbrush and slept an exhausted sleep was not truly human, only the shell
170 that had at one time contained humanity.
171 pppppppppppppppppppp
172 actually, I find myself writing solo because no one seems to be into
173 fantasy adventures right now.  I welcome anyone else who would like to 
174 drop into this story line -- but be careful!! The piper isn't a very good
175 companion right now...

180                                Part 2
181 
182         While most of the crew struggled to survive, recycling precious
183 water in the ship's scrubber units, and growing small amounts of food in
184 the hydroponic garden, the ship's commanding officer, a captain Racal,
185 had much more to worry about than survival. The utmost thing on his mind
186 was death, gr the inevitable death he associated with Sahara's landing on
187 Dry Gulch. He knew the truth, that the chances for rescue were minuscule.
188 The possibilities of the beacon's emergency signal getting to a base capable
189 of mounting an expeditionary force were slim to none. Racal knew this to be
190 true, but he didn't let on. It was a secret, a horror he must keep to himself,
191 starting again due to line noise
192 The possibilities of the beacon's emergency signal getting to a base capable
193 of mounting an expeditionary force were slim to none. Racal knew this to be
194 true, but he didn't let on. It was a secret, a horror he must keep to himself,
195 lest he inject utter despair into the ranks of the crew. Sahara was so far
196 off course, and so far away even from the ever growing boundaries of a
197 space hungry colonizing Man, it was useless to pretend! But he must pretend,
198 for the good of the crew, regardless of what it did to him inside. This
199 planet would be Sahara's final resting place, and her crew's tomb for all
200 eternity. It was only a matter of time.
201 
202         Life went on, slowly, surely, inexorably to its logical conclusion.
203 Txe hydroponics material was growing short on strength, and the crew found
204 out the hard way that the planet was no farmer's paradise. The soil was so
205 alkaline, most earth type seeds were literally dissolved. And then there was
206 the sun, with its never ending fusillade of heat, burning whatever hardy crops
207 that made it to the surface to a cinder. Makeshift covers did no good, the
208 ambient temperature was too high for anything to survive outside the more
209 controlled confines of the ship. Sahara, that last bastion of life for Man,
210 suffered too. Hyper-tronic parts started failing first, victims of the heat
211 that even the huge air conditioning units the engineering department converted
212 from engine parts and installed could not keep totally at bay. With the loss
213 of some of the more important 'tronic modules, it was impossible to keep
214 track of the signals the rescue beacon was sending out. Soon visual
215 confirmation became the only assurance that the small beacon still circled
216 the planet, sending out the call for help. Help that captain Racal knew
217 would never come.
218 
219         The first crewman died, six weeks after setting down on Dry Gulch.
220 He was topside on Sahara, repairing a broken solar panel that helped charge
221 the ship's electric cells. The heat of the sun bouncing off the hull of the
222 ship, coupled with reduced food and water rations, and the strenuous labor,
223 caused the man to have a sun-stroke. He fell into a coma and simply never
224 woke up. The proper arrangements were made for a burial on the harsh
225 surface of Dry Gulch. The funeral service was naturally perfunctory. The
226 men and women of the crew could not stay out in the heat very long without
227 suffering the similar fate their companion had. The location was marked with
228 a simple headstone, and the inscription read:
229 
230                             Lt. Samual Bowman                            b. 2213 d. 2239
231                             Dry Gulch claimed
232                             its first victim.
233                             He died so others
234                             could live.
235 
236         The crew's moral sank rapidly from this time on. Instead of the
237 rallying affect Racal thought Bowman's death might have on the crew, just
238 the opposite happened. Racal had hoped the death would bring the crew around,
239 give them something to fight againsth, and something to fight for,
240 life, no matter how short that life may be. Unfortunately for all, this
241 did not occur. Men and women who worked side by side for these many weeks
242 started to withdraw. Fights broke out over the smallest of reasons; an
243 extra glass of water or a forgotten duty call. Most of the crew lost
244 interest in betting on the arrival of the beacon, their one last connection
245 with the worlds they knew and loved beyond. The feelings of despair were
246 a tragic consequence of the death, but they were also a realization of the
247 true situation they were in. Interstellar personnel were intelligent, highly
248 trained individuals. The epiphany of their plight was certain to dawn on
249 them sooner or later. Talk about never getting off the planet was heard for
250 the first time throughout the crew. It seemed no one was safe from the lost
251 feelings; the entire ship's complement seemed to give up at once, suddenly,
252 but with inescapable certainty.

270           The susurations of the dream reality are trapped within my ear's
271 cavity, echoing untouchable thoughts until at last they gain solubility.
272 Submerged in blindness and obscurity, I begin to float like wafts of smoke.
273 The smoke curls up the staircase to the sky, a gray line masked on blackness.
274 Slowly, the blackness divulges from the clouds and pours its liquid color into
275 my mind. Slowly, the strangeness of the dream fades, transforming itself into
276 my reality.
277          Thoughts flow in my head as my imagination reates them. The dream 
278 frame and the waking frame become inseparable, I exist in both of them or
279 none at all. A bird circles over head, and two gray figures talk in the
280 distance. I lay silent, a weak form, below the flapping wings. Words sing
281 past me, although they have been captured in my memory. 
282          I feel my mind and body giving away, I'm melting into the gray misty
283 floor. As my spirit, my life's vitality, begins to fade waway, a strain of lost
284 hope returns. It's only one silken thread but a strong one. One hand, either
285 of exterier forces or of my own, reaches into my mind. I feel the strength
286 rekindling as the weakness melts into the mist.

290      The Innkeeper ver casually made his way around the tables after the Inn 
291 had once again closed its doors for the evening.  Much to his suprise, there 
292 really wasn't that much to pick up after this time.  It seemed that there
293 were a few of the patrons that had done him an extra favor of not only cleaning
294 up after themselves, but after a few of the others as well..  This had been 
295 a more common occurance of late, but this time it allowed him to pay special
296 attention to the condition of what it was that he was cleaning up from.
297      As he reached a back table that received very little use recently, he 
298 began to wipe of the tables and chairs just for good measure.
299      "And what's this?  How odd, it could have been sitting here for some time
300 considering the dust that's settled..  [I know - no real dust ever accumulates.]
301 And by the looks of it, it is surely something that someone would miss.."
302 He set the object on the table while he finished the chores he had set out to
303 do before retiring.  Once completed, he picked up the object and headed back
304 to the counter and placed it up on a shelf where the owner would be sure to
305 find it upon their return -- hoping they would return.
306      "I think I just might have a hunch to whom it belongs, but the last time
307 I saw it was quite some time ago..."  The Innkeeper's words faded within the
308 emptied building and went to the back where he could enjoy his rest alone.
309 
310      The light of a single unextinguished candle found its way to that object
311 on the shelf and made it glisten.  The glow that surrounded it made the
312 figurines winged image seem amost surreal.

470       Silent shapes slipped through the underbrush.  Great grey silent. 
471   C. Lupus an emotionless emperican would call them.  He was not present; they
472 were.
473       They did not approach too closely the still form on the forrest floor,
474 the object of thair curiosity.  They
475 knew well the form of man.  More to the
476 point they knew the scent of man.  It was to them the estral message of fear.
477       Not without paranoia, the few small bands that had survived the centuries
478 of the round eard two legged ones self-serving and vicios tales.  Of course the
479 four legged ones knew nothing of the telling of frightning stories to quell the
480 unrulyness of cubs or to thrill and 
481 excite thair listeners.  Yet not a one of this small band had failed to witness
482 in its short lifetime the distructiveness of 'human' hate (and fear).
483      Was it an ill omen or some sign of a dim passed, remembered only in the
484 racial memory of the cells, when the two legged ones had not been enimies but
485 companions of the hunt, learning its ways when survival was an uncertain thing
486 for both.  Yes even then there had been fear, but there had also been something
487 else, a sort of mutual.  In time, some of the two leggs had seen the wisdom of
488 taking the four leggs as partners.
489       Those the 'humans' had befriended had over the centuries become more the
490 servants of the two leggs and less and less like thair woodland breathren.
491       There was no smell of the streight black sticks that pointed at death 
492  about this one.  It seemed whole of body and its howls had been firm.  Yet 
493 there had been something undefinable not quite well.  Was it prey? (not likely)
494  Was it a hunter like themselves or was it one of those dangerous enimies who
495 would reack havoc and destruction upon themselves if given half a chance?
496      Forrest Fang was not the Alpha male, hauty, assured in its strength and
497 mass, fallowed by all but challanged by all who would take his place; not a 
498 young proto-alpha eager for such a chalange nor an alfa female the most danger-
499 ous of the pack in her own way.  No, Forrest Fang was none of these, nor was
500 he a gama eather.  Rather he was the beta male.  Cubhood long gone, who from
501 time to time enjoied some of the power of the alpha without the constant chal-
502 anges or as much defferance paid by the others, but not without some.
503     It was Forrest Fang who nuzzeled the side of the still two legged form, 
504 then jumped back prepaired for what might come (he hoped).  He half-way expec-
505 ted the alpha's dissapproval for this rash act but the dominant male did not 
506 censure.
507     Warily the all stepped back a pace as the human started to stir.

542      I've hurt her.  Oh God, I've hurt her.  Never did I mean 
543 to do that.  And it hurts deep inside.  The one true friend 
544 I have in the world, and I've hurt her.  I said something
545 I shouldn't, and I caused her great pain, and now that pain is 
546 mine as well.  I've hurt her, oh God, I've hurt her.  
547      I opened my heart, I told her my deepest most private 
548 desires, and I hurt her, oh God, I've hurt her.  I said the 
549 wrong words, I did the wrong thing, and now I would give anything
550 to take it back again, I hurt her, oh God, I've hurt her.  
551      If only she would speak, say it's alright, but instead 
552 there is silence, a deep dark silence so dark.  I've hurt her,
553 oh God, why did I hurt her.  Through my own stupidity I've lost 
554 my one true friend, the one I could speak of such things to, 
555 but I said the wrong thing, and now I've hurt her.  
556      And it hurts deep inside, like a knife striking deep,
557 draining the life giving fluids from inside. I thought I could
558 say what I felt deep inside, but I hurt her with my love, I
559 said the wrong thing, and now she hates me because I hurt her.
560 Oh God, why did I have to hurt her?  She hates me because 
561 I hurt her.
562      If only she would speak, say it's alright.  I've lost the
563 one I could talk to, I've lost my best friend.  All because
564 of my own stupidity. I've hurt her.  Oh God, I've hurt her,
565 and I've hurt myself as well.
