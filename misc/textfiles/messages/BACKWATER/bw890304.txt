 33     "This the Slums? Well, actually it is close to the outer edge. There
 34 aren't many people living in this area anymore, things have been going rather
 35 badly in this part of this world."
 36  
 37      "Really? I hope it's not plauges, I've read enough about them to know I 
 38 don't want to be in one."
 39  
 40      "No not plauges, Just the random hand of change washing over the walls 
 41 of the city."
 42  
 43      "What sort of change?" Patrick asked trying to keep up with
 44 the wanderers long rapid strides.
 45  
 46      "The slave trade was outlawed here a querter of a century ago. Agate
 47 bay was the hub of it. Can't say I'm to disapointed by their loss of business."
 48 The wanderer replied grimly.
 49  
 50      They walked the rest of the way in silence. The overgrown and deserted
 51 streets eventually improved and people could be seen going about their daily
 52 business. Occasionally somebody would stare with indifference at them.
 53  
 54      They took many turns and soon Patrick was hopelessly lost. When they
 55 finally stoped it was in front of a three story green building that according
 56 to the sign hanging above the door was "Brians school of Magic."
 57  
 58      The paint was slowly peeling from the walls and the door opened only
 59 with a healthy shove. Patrick followed the Wanderer into the musty lobby.
 60  
 61      Inside the building it was dim and dusty, though cleaner then the outside
 62 had led Patrick to believe it would be. The lobby was 10 meters on a side and
 63 lined with empty benches. To the right of the entrance was a window and 
 64 counter much like the ones in old movie theatres. In the window sat a bored
 65 looking middle aged women. She glanced over at them. "Can I help you gents?"
 66 She asked managing to sound barely interested.
 67  
 68      "Martha! hello how are you? It's been a while." The Wanderer said.
 69  
 70      "Is that you Ethan? I didn't recognize you!" Martha said growing more
 71 enthusiastic.
 72  
 73      "Ethan?" Patrick thought.
 74  
 75      "Yes it's me Martha. And this is a friend of mine. His name is Patrick."
 76  
 77      "Hello mam." Patrick managed.
 78  
 79      "Well, good to see you. I really do need to get some new glasses, imagine
 80 not recognizing Ethan Lore."
 81  
 82      The Wanderer fidgeted. "Quite alright Martha. I've come to see Brian,
 83 is he in?"
 84  
 85      "Yes, he's busy teaching a class in advanced Magic symbols. Should be done
 86 in any minute."
 87  
 88      The Wanderer and Martha continued to converse asold friends.
 89  
 90      Patrick looked around and noticed that Cymry had lain down by one of the
 91 benches. He walked over and sat on the bench beside him.
 92  
 93       "So were have you been boy?" He said rubbing behind the Sheaperds Ears.
 94  
 95       The dog looked at him curioslly and lifted his head up revealing a 
 96 small silver tube attached to his coller by a clip.

128 Ok, not much action. On to the next part of my story.
129  
130      Patrick reached out with his left hand and grasped it between his 
131 thumb and forefinger. All at once his surroundings faded and he was floating
132 in the air above a small table upon which sat a crystal ball.
133      The room that contained the table was brightly decorated with 
134 tapastries, beads and bells. Light seemed to emanate from everywere at 
135 once. He noted all of this in an instance.
136      There was a noise and His attention was drawn to the only door in the 
137 room. It opened and in walked a girl. She smiled at him. He was dazled. There 
138 was somthing about her face...
139      "Patrick!. Patrick! oh good, Martha he's coming around. Patrick 
140 opened his eyes and stared up into the face of the Wanderer. 
141      "She was beutifull." He muttered.
142      "Why thank you lad!" Martha said walking up with a twinkle in her eyes. 
143 She added "Just teezing you, who was beutifull? You sure gave us a fit when 
144 you fell over onto the floor like you were dead or somthing. Thought maybe a 
145 stray spell had gotten you. Then again maybe one did."
146      "No, It was some sort of Astral projection. I can feel it. What do you
147 remember Patrick?" The Wanderer asked.
148      "Hmm? Oh, I was in a room. It had a crystal ball and fancy blankets on 
149 the wall. There was a door and it opened..."
150      "And?"
151      "And a girl walked in. She smiled at me... and then I was back here."
152     "Sounds like he's under a spell to me." Martha commented. "I don't smell
153 any charm magic around him though."
154     "Very strange indeed. Do you have any idea what might have caused it
155 Patrick?"
156      "I remember sitting down... Things get cloudy after that."
157     A bell sounded and feet could be heard pounding the floor above. Soon
158 people of all ages filed into the lobby and out the front door. Patrick 
159 managed to return to his seat.
160      "We'll have to investigate this further later, right now we should go
161 see about talking to Brian. He's a very busy man."
162      Patrick got unsteadilly to his feet and with help from Martha  and the 
163 Wanderer managed to climb up the flight of stairs.  
164      The stairs opened up onto a long hallway that spaned the entire building. 
165 There were doors lining either side. As they passed Patrick noticed that other 
166 then the strange symbols on the chalk boards they looked much like classrooms 
167 back home. 
168     Patrick felt his strength return as they stoped in front of one of the 
169 doors and the Wanderer knocked.
170     "Come in" A voice said from inside. 
171      "I'll have to be getting back to work now. You two stop by and say good 
172 bye before you leave." Martha told them.
173      The Wanderer opened the door and walked in. Patrick followed. Sitting 
174 behind a desk at the head of the classroom was a man dressed in robes not
175 unlike those that Patrick wore. He had a long gray beard and gray hair
176 that stuck out at all angles. He reminded Patrick of Einshtien for some 
177 reason.  
178      "Brian, I'd like you to meet a new friend of mine. His name is Patrick." 
179 The Wanderer said by way of introduction.
180      "Ethan, Always the impulsive one. Why do you bring me this child?" Brian
181 asked.
182      "Don't his clothes tip you off? I think he has great potential, and thus
183 of course I thought of you first."
184      "Ah, if a man dresses like a king does that make him a king? Yes Ethan he
185 has the tools. I suppose it is up to me to see if he has the talent." 
186      "Come here lad, I have a test for you."

194 was rapidly distilled and organized into a very interesting picture. It
195 seemed that Bleary had indeed been tagged, and as part of raid on the

207         It took us about an hour to work out a plan.  We were going to
208 try to cast a Sending- the magickal equivalent of a pager.  I had just
209 learned about pagers from a large tome Merryl had found in the studio
210 called The Yellow Pages.
211         To perform Magick, one needs three things- music, precision,
212 and the Power.  I knew where my strengths lay- the music and the Power.
213 Merryl was precise and also played well.  To cast a Major Spell such as
214 a Sending we had to work together, something we knew how to do in theory
215 but had never done.  We began our preparations....
216 ###############
217         The School of Magick in Dunbarrah is unique in many ways.  One of
218 the most notable is that the walls are made of interlocking slabs of
219 granite, bound and warded by powerful dweomers.  It is, therefore, one of
220 the few buildings in Plesia sturdy enough to house the two hundred
221 apprentices without being blown to bits by a stray magick spell.
222         It is not a coincidence that the first Basic Spell taught at
223 the School is 'Protection from Magick'.
224         In the midst of the din surrounding the School, the bright flash and
225 *BANG* of newly arrived Earth musicians went completely unnoticed.
226         Believing themselves in the cross-fire of rival gangs, the Ruckus
227 fled for the relative safety of the nearby forest.
228 ###############
229         "Reach out, reach out and..." we began, the keyboard and harmonica
230 cutting the air with crisp notes.  I set the keyboard to repeat and continued
231 with my flute.
232         SNAP!  A blue mist formed in the center of the far wall, growing
233 larger every instant.  I concentrated as I never had before, composing as
234 I played, describing with music my instructor.
235         The mist formed a ring, the center changed color.  It was very dark.
236 Light snoring reached our ears.
237         I stopped playing, hoping that the keyboard would maintain the
238 Sending....it was still there.  Was that Zariah I heard snoring?
239         "Teacher!"  Merryl yelled.  "Help us!"
240         Snort.  Mumble.  "...eh?  What?  No more pranks, if you please, or
241 your chores will be double tomorrow.  Go to bed."
242         "Zariah!  We are not in Plesia.  I don't know how long we can
243 continue this Sending... wake up!"
244         He sat upright, eyes quickly focusing on us.  I could see his outline
245 in the moonlight from his window.
246         "Pan?  Merryl?  A Sending?  Bravo, my boys.  Well done.  You
247 have studied ahead, I see."
248         "Never mind that.  I miscast and Merryl and I ended up here.  We
249 met some nice people, tried to show them what the School looked like with
250 an Illusion, but they walked into it and disappeared.  We need to find them
251 and then get home."
252         Zariah was wide awake, now.  He peered into the Sending and
253 squinted at the instruments behind us.  "You're...on Earth?  America, unless
254 I miss my guess.  Hoo, boy are you in it.  The current Earth time period
255 is very violent.  I suggest returning first."
256         "That's part of our problem.  How do we do that?"
257         Our teacher pondered that.  "You did not go intentionally, so you
258 must be near a Power center else you would not have WorldWalked there.
259 If you find this Power source a simple Doorway spell will suffice to return
260 you to Dunbarrah."
261         "What about our friends?" asked Merryl.
262         "I suspect Pan let his Illusion turn into a Gate.  You ad-libbed
263 part of the music, didn't you?"
264         "Yes," I admitted.
265         "Never mind that.  Watch yourself in the future.  I shall attempt
266 to find these Earth people and send them back.  I hope they haven't made
267 much trouble.  Find the Power source, or..."
268         The misty ring faded away.
269         "...you might never return."  I finished.

292         "Hurry, Pan!" called Merryl.  "I hear someone coming!"
293         I had my hands full, working with Johnny's keyboard.  It had taken
294 most of the night.  I had a hunch that when he and the Ruckus returned,
295 they would need help;  I hoped it would be enough.
296         Merryl appeared at the door, running.  "Those men who chased us!
297 They're downstairs!"  I heard feet pounding upon the old creaky staircase.
298         "Number seventeen!"  I yelled, finishing the last notes.
299         Merryl opened a window, letting in the cold winter air.  I could
300 hear voices coming nearer.  I suppose it would be a colossal understatement
301 to say that they seemed angry.  Merryl began his music as the door fell
302 from its frame.  They wore ghoulish grins upon their faces; the blades of
303 their knives glinted brightly.
304         "You're the guys that did that flare trick." said the largest.
305         "I regretted the necessity, of course," I said, "but I fear you
306 left us with no choice."  Merryl began to glow with a faint blue aura,
307 his music concluded.
308         "Hey!" yelled the head lunk, advancing.
309         Merryl grabbed my hand, and we leapt through the window.  The aura
310 enveloped both of us, halting our decent.  Soon, we flew eastward into the
311 new dawn.
312 ###############
313         Zariah allowed himself several moments to shake off the tendrils
314 of slumber.  He had a tremendous task before him, and he dreaded it.
315 What would people from Earth do, arriving unexpectedly in Dunbarrah?
316 Zariah hoped they had the good sense to say put.
317         He dressed quickly, not wanting to waste time.  He took up his
318 own instrument, the glihri.  It was a small wind instrument resembling
319 a flute, capable of very high, sharp notes.  Zariah blew a few experimental
320 notes on it, then began casting a Major Augury.
321 ###############
322         Bright sunlight woke Johnny, Syd, Tony, and Tom.  Rising in the
323 midst of a lush forest was beyond their experience.
324         "Hey- what's up?" demanded Syd.  He nudged Johnny awake.
325         He woke with a start.  "...incoming!  Duck!  Get outta the..." he
326 sputtered.  Double take.  He gave a long, hard stare to Tony.  "Where did
327 you get that beer, Tony?  As if I didn't know."
328         "It was the normal stuff!" Tony protested.
329         "Sure it was."  Johnny looked around.  "Anyone remember where we
330 are?"
331         "Sure ain't the Studio,"  observed Tom.
332         "'How profound, Wizard!'  Thinking caps on, people.  This resembles
333 major disaster time."
334         Syd spoke up.  "Hey!  You said wizard.  I remember these two funny
335 guys you brought up..."
336         "Got something there.  Yeah, robes and all.  Funky old instruments.
337 Then one of 'em did something funny with my board..."  A pained expression
338 crossed Johnny's face.  "Did we...walk here?  Through the wall, like
339 Alice in Wonderland?"
340         "I wasn't gonna say it."
341         "Me neither."

403 #########################################################################
404 To Muse:  I thank you for your high praise.  As for lit classes, I have
405 not taken such- I'm just telling a story as it comes to me.  An outline
406 is set, but I am free to work within those bounds.  I have some details
407 worked out for cohesiveness (what the first Thirty Spells are, for
408 example), and I refer back to my previous writing so I do not
409 contradict myself.
410 ###############
411         The morning light fell upon the face of the city, which yawned
412 and proceeded to awaken.  Merryl and I descended quickly, now knowing that
413 human flight would be highly conspicuous.
414         The problem of the Power source haunted us, but there remained
415 more practical questions.  We were getting hungry, and fatigue was
416 beginning to sap our strength.  How could you pay for an inn or buy food
417 with extra-dimensional money?  Merryl and I were certain that Plesia
418 tokens would not be accepted as readily as we were accustomed.
419         We studied our surroundings carefully.  No passersby seemed to be
420 interested in us, on the contrary: people avoided our gaze.  We puzzled
421 over that a bit but finally shrugged and continued on.
422         "Pan," said Merryl, "does that symbol seem familiar to you?"
423         The symbol, an abstract bell inside a circle, was painted upon
424 a small sign at the top of a rectangular box.
425         "Yellow Pages!" I remembered.
426         "Right as always, chum.  I remember seeing something about coin
427 dealers.  Perhaps we could exchange our tokens there."
428 ###############
429         The last notes faded away, and there was silence.  The music had
430 given way to light- a faint white glow that permeated everything but
431 touched nothing.  Zariah gestured, and the glow confined itself to a
432 small sphere before him.
433         "Where can I find the Earthers?" asked the mage, pointing at the
434 sphere with one gnarled hand.
435         The sphere pulsed once, and changed shape.  Its features flowed
436 like water as it shaped itself into a simple pointer.  After it had held
437 this form a few moments, the shape faded.
438         "Forest, eh?  Figures.  If you truly surprise a man, shake his
439 view of reality, what does he do?  Go primitive.  Harumph.  Well, might
440 as well go see what mischief they've gotten into."
441 ###############
442         Johnny suddenly shrugged and said, "There's gotta be an
443 explanation for this.  Let's go find it."  He helped the Ruckus to its
444 feet, then marched in a random direction.
445         "You know where you're goin', Johnny?" asked Syd.
446         "Nah.  I'm just going to walk this way 'till we hit a road.
447 Shouldn't be more than a few miles, the way people been buildin' the last
448 few years."
449         "Wasn't that robed guy showing us his home city when we..."
450 Tony hesitated, then continued.  "...walked through?  We walked right into
451 the picture.  This should be his Done-bar-rah place."
452         That stopped Johnny.  This was definitely too weird.  Not only
453 had the beer had a little som'tin' extra in it, the gang was still out of
454 it.  He had to rely on his own thinking, at least for a while.
455         "Listen- I figure we wandered into Forest Park while we were
456 blasted, and don't remember.  I don't see a trail, yet, but that don't
457 mean we went through yon lookin'-glass, got me?"
458         "Yeah, Johnny.  Got it."
459         "Let's go that way, then.  Downhill means water, eventually.
460 Water means people."
461         "Smartest thing been said all day."

464 &*&*&*&*'s
465 Thank you Muse. I'll endevor to maintain the quelity. A spell check would
466 no doubt make things better. Onward and downward.
467  
468      "What do you see on the board behind me son?" Brian asked him.
469      Patrick looked at the board. It was covered with the strange symbols
470 he had seen written on the boards in the other rooms they had passed. At 
471 first he couldn't make anything of them. Many of them made him dizzy. He 
472 fixated on one in particuler, looking at it from every angle. A word formed
473 in his head. He said it.
474      Suddenly a large shimering blue door opened in the wall. It opened and
475 there was a brilliant flash of light. When his vision cleared Patrick found
476 himself back in his room. Brian sat with a perplexed expresion on his face
477 at Patricks desk. Cymry was lying on his bed. The Wanderer seemed to have 
478 dissapered completly.
479      There was a moment of silence and then Brian spoke. "Well, I suppose you
480 passed the test. I would guess that this is your home?"
481      "Yes, this is my room. How did THAT happen?" 
482      "You somehow managed to read the symbol of return. I know 3rd year student
483 who have trouble with that one. So, would you like to be my apprentice?"
484      "I have to think about it. What happened to the Wanderer?" Patrick 
485 answered.
486      "Ethan you mean? That is strange. I think there is more to him then I had 
487 previosly thought. Always did dress strangly..."
488      His Grandmother called from the hall. "Patrick! are you in there?"
489      "Yes Grandma."
490      "Were have you been?" She said opening his door.
491      "Uhmm," Patrick said looking around at were Brian was. Or had been, he
492 was gone now. "I went out for a walk. look who I ran into." He said pointing
493 at Cymry.
494      "Well I'll be, I wonder were he's been all this time! Whats he doing on
495 the bed? Cymry, down boy, you know better then that."
496      The Dog obediantly stood and jumped to the floor were he curled up in a
497 ball.
498      "Where did you get those strange clothes?" 
499      "I'm thinking of trying out for a play at school." Patrick improvised.
500      "Really? That would be nice, do you good to meet some new people. It's
501 not healthy you being alone in this room all the time."
502      "Yes Grandma. I'm going out later, I might not be back till late. I have
503 to go to the library and look some stuff up."
504      "Alright, but you be carefull." She said leaving the room.
505      "Close call that." Brian said poping back in view. "Good thing I'm 
506 fast with the old disapering spell."
507      "I really don't see how I could be your apprentice, I have school 
508 here."
509      "I see your problem. It would be selfish of me to expect you to give up
510 your family and friends just to come and study with me."
511      "I don't really have much family left, just my Grandmother. I do have
512 a few friends though. Perhaps I could study magic in my spare time. Even
513 with school I have a fair amount of time left over."
514      "Allright then. Your first lesson will be to discover the purpose and 
515 power of this rune." Brian said pulling a piece of parchment out of his robes 
516 and marking on it. Once finished he placed it on Patricks desk.
517      "I really must be going now. There was a rather fascinating formula I was
518 working on..." And with a small flash of light he was gone.
519      Patrick walked over and stared at the strange symbol for several minutes.
520 It was no use, it meant nothing to him. He shrugged and opening a drawer 
521 placed it carfully inside.

542 Ah, So little. Even the lurks are getting rather limeted. Ok, here comes 
543 part 10. part 11 coming tommorow. 
544  
545                             II
546  
547      After he had removed his coat and placed it on the bed 
548 Patrick took the food out of his backpack and placed it back in the 
549 fridge. He grabed a few cokies from the cokie jar and a can of Pepsi and 
550 headed back to his room. 
551      He had a sudden thought and stopped off at the bathroom. He turned on
552 the cold water tap in the tub and stuck the pack under the faucet. As he had
553 expected the pack was water tight. The Wanderer had said that the pack would
554 lighten as stuff was added to it. When it was halfway full Patrick tried 
555 picking it up and found it was nearly weightless. Soon after that it began
556 to float as more and more water was added. When it was nearly full he could 
557 barely hold it down. He turned off the water, zipped up the pack and
558 looking out the door to be sure his Grandmother was not around returned to his 
559 room.
560      Looking at the pack firmly seated on the ceiling was strange to say the 
561 least. Even the zipper seemed to be water tight as no water dripped out of it.
562      Patrick shrugged and managed to force it into his closet. He'd have to
563 empty it somtime, but right now he had other things to do.
564      He began rifling through his desk looking for the letter that had 
565 accompanied the orb his uncle had sent him. It hadn't seemed important at
566 the time...
567      There it was. shoved in back of a bunch of old magazines in the back
568 of the bottom drawer. He opened it and pulled out the short hand drawn
569 note.
570  
571      "Dear Patrick,
572      I was sorry to hear about the dissaperence of your parents, I know what a 
573 terible blow it must have been. I can only tell you that I am sure they are
574 fine. I wish I could meet you, but believe me when I tell you that I can't.
575       You will find accomponying this letter a box that contains a small 
576 green orb. It is a focus. I think that given time you will find a use for it.
577                                              Best wishes,
578                                              Uncle Tad."
579  
580      There was no return address though it was postmarked New York City. No hel
581 there Patrick thought. He'd thrown away the box soon after the holiday had
582 ended too.
583      He went to find his Grandmother. He found her in the living room knitting.
584 "You know Patrick, it's really strange Cymry showing up like that." She said
585 when she saw him come into the room. "He looks like he's been well taken care
586 of to."
587       Patrick fidgeted. "I suppose somebody was looking after him."
588       "He must have jumped over the fence, I don't know why he'd do that though
589 Hseemed to be happy here."
590       "Yes Grandma." 
591       "Well, I'm just glad he's back. It's good to have a guard dog." She 
592 looked at him "Was there somthing you wanted to ask me?" 
593       "Ah what do you know about Uncle Tad"
594       "Tad? He's you mothers brother. I think I met him when your mother
595 and father got married. I'm sure I havn't seen him since then. Came as quite
596 a suprise to hear from him. Could have sent you somthing a bit more usefull
597 then that silly green ball."
598       "Thanks Grandma." Patrick said going back to his room. When he got
599 there he picked up his coat from the bed , opened his bedroom window, and 
600 climbed out into the back yard.

623 others down is hard.  Life is hard.  To each goes an amount of things.
624 Spend them with wisdom"
625  
626    Rebuttal: Commitment is the proportional measure of the faith you
627 have in yourself.  Truth is easy to find, but is hard to face.  As
628 for supporting others, well, it is a measure of your friendship with
629 them.  Life is NOT hard; the other people around you just make it
630 SEEM difficult, that's all.  People tend to live in the dream world
631 called "Portland, Oregon", controlled by rules, guided by law
632 enforcement towards uniformity (so when's the last time you were
633 speeding at 85 mph on 217?), and set by those we gave OUR power to.
634 I agree with the last two lines - materials are hard to come by.
635  
636    I am not advocating violence; for that is a true plague that can
637 only be stopped by reason.  I am not advocating the overthrow of
638 government; we (supposedly) put ourselves "here", so why rock the
639 boat?

714 Actually I'm about 88 parts away from part 100. You'll notice some small 
715 inconsistancies as it continues. This is because I am modifying it as I go
716 along. So here is part 12.
717  
718      He landed on his feet and looked around. It was now late 
719 afternoon. There was somthing he wanted to do before he had to eat dinner.
720      He walked over to the central porch and climbed up. The Treant showed
721 no sign of movement at his approach. He waited standing under its sheltering
722 branches. "Treant?"
723      There was no answer. He waited awhile longer before giving up and heading
724 for the waterfall. The Pixies flew about talking in their High pitched speach.
725 He smiled at them and they smiled back. "Could you tell Anji that I need to
726 talk to her?" He said to a group of them. 
727      They conversed amoungst themselves. Eventually one of them came forward.
728 It was Roni, a pixie he had talked to on occasion in the past.
729      "Hello Patrick humen." He said. "It is unfortunete that I must tell you
730 that Anji has left."
731      "Left? Do you know were she went?"
732      "No, Though she said when she came that leave she would some day."
733      "When did she come to live here?"
734      "It was not long before you first came to this place. You were much smalle
735 tn though still large. She to was not as big."
736      "She told me I was going on a long journey, and yet I am back before the
737 end of the day. And now she is gone."
738      "You think your journey is done? Anji told you truth. Your destination
739 you have not reached yet."
740      "Can't you tell me more then that?"
741      "To journey is sacred thing. Would not do for I or we to tell you to 
742 much about it."
743      "Did she say when she would be back?"
744      "Anji not cminw back Patrick. She to had journey. Move on she did. Not
745 returning here I would think."
746      Patrick conversed with Roni for awhile longer but was unable to gain any
747 any more usefull information. The Pixie seemed intent on giving him as |ittle
748 as he could. Finally he shruged thanked Roni and returned to his 
749 room through the window.
750      After dinner he excused himself and went to the room to get ready for
751 the trip to the library. He opened the closet door and pulled his pask out. 
752 Since he didn't want to risk his Grandmother seeing it he again opened 
753 his window and emtied the pack out. It now felt like it contained several 
754 heavy books. To lighten things up he pulled half a dozen books off of his
755 shulf.0At the last moment he realized that it was still wet inside.
756      "I certainly don't want to turn it inside out and shake." He said 
757 to Cymry who was now awake and staring at him. "I suppose you're hungry 
758 aren't you? I think we can ki|l two birds with one stone here. Follow me 
759 Boy."
760      Out in the Kitchen Patrick gathered up some scraps for Cymry and put 
761 them in a bowl. After filling his water dish as well Patrick went to the 
762 cupboard and grabbed a plastic garbawe bag.
763      "Were are you going with that bag Patrick?" His Grandmother asked him 
764 as he ran past. "I hope Cymry didn't make a mess in your room."
765      "No Grandma, Uh, I'm tring somthing out I read in a survival manual 
766 once."
767    0 "Dn't you get yourself suffocated. Plastic bags are dangerose things you 
768 know."
769      "Yes Grandma, I'll be carefull."
770      Getting back to his room he carefully rapped the books in the plastic bag 
771 and placed them inside the pack. "Perfuct." Patrick said hefting the now
772 light bag.
773      "I'm going to the library Grandma." As he walked out the door.
774      "Have a good time."
775      "Ok, Bye."

794 this board? or anykind of writing? poetry? also, what's this about teh
795 Inn? (sorry if i'm being terribly dense). and vinally, some one asked
796 me to tell a little about myself - and i'm at a loss - what would you
797 like to know?

801 Well, Alyx, most of the stories posted on this board have been of the
802 fantasy type. But, this board is in no way restricted to the field of
803 vantqsy writing. If you want, you can write about anything you want.
804 You can write a poem, jokes, anything! No restrictions to fantasy only.
805 Hmm, about that Inn stuff, I must be dense too, because I have read too
806 about it and have wanted to0ask but didn't in fear that I might be ranked
807 on. I don't think I asked you to tell some stuff about yourself, but if
808 someone did, they, and I, would like to know stuff like: Your age, what
809 your interests are, school you go to or occupation< etc. just what you
810 are like, etc. anything you want to tell! This is a very good board. I
811 hope you stick around. New users are always welcome. Later Alyx.

842 Justin d'Blue stoped by a few disks back. I believe he now resides in 
843 Corvalis. I dhink I have a usenet adress for him if anybody is interested.
844 Now for part 12 I suppose.
845  
846      It was dark as Patrick started his trip to the Library. The wind was
847 turning chill and the stars were perched in their ussuall places.
848      He turned left and walked to the end of the block, waited for the light
849 to change, looked both ways and crossed the street. continued straight
850 for two blocks and then another left turn. To the end of the block, a 
851 right turn acrosc0the0street and to the front doors of the library. Through the
852 outer doors, a right turn and through the inner door.
853      It was warm inside. People were scattered about examining the stacks,
854 reading or speaking quitly.
855      Patrick walked up to the front desk. "Can I help you Sir?" The Librarian
856 asked him.
857      "Yes please, could you get me the microfilm for the Advocate? March of
858 last year please."
859      "Certainly." She walked back and through a doorway into the bask room
860 of the Library. Shortly after she came back with film. "You know how to
861 thread the machine?"
862      "Yes, Thank You."
863      Patrick picked up the tape and walked over to one of the viewers. He 
864 inserted the tape and sat down. For several moments he just stared at the
865 screen without turning on the viewer. He'd been avoiding looking at these
866 papers since... 
867      His father had been a Doctor. His mother a Sales Rep. Being an only
868 child he had gotten more then hys sxare of love. When he came home that
869 day he was suprised to see both their cars in the parking lot. Neither
870 of them ussually got home till after five. He went inside... And the
871 house was empty.  
872 He looked all over the Kitchen and i~ thu livingroom. The note he had expected
873 to find wasn't anywere to be found. He wasn't really worried at first. When
874 they were still gone the next morning he called 911. Everything had been
875 a nightmair for the next few weeks. He still felt a bit numb even a year
876 later.
877      Taking several deep breaths he reached forward and fliped the switch. 
878 Light flared on the screen and as he advanced the film pages began to appear.
879      March 15,16,19,24,26,27 Ah, March 28th. The dqi afder the disaperence.
880 Patrick started his search there. There was a small item on page three,
881 and in the following Sundays paper he found another mention. After that,
882 nothing.
883      Perhaps 500 words total. It wasn't even close to bei~g e~ough. He was to
884 old to cry, But he did so anyway. The tears passed and the grief subsided 
885 somewhat. 
886      He hadn't let himself really think about them in awhile. Why did they 
887 leave? Where did they go? Were they even alive? Feeli~g drained he 
888 drifted into sleep.
889      "Sir?" 
890      "Yes?" Patrick said awakening.
891      "We're closing now."
892      "Ok, Thanks."
893      He picked up his pack rewound the film and handed it to the Librarian.
894 It was 11 o'closk. Time to get home and go to bed.
895 P.S.
896 Anybody got an idea for a title?
