30   for the better band that followed?  You know who...  The Moody Blues!

40 Voyeur: Godzilla represents a whole schema of society's ills. The monster that manifests itself from man's tinkering
41 with his world, exploring things he has no business exploring, playing God when he has neither the intelligence or the
42 morals to do so. Godzilla represents all of this, as the delicate system of checks and balances is thrown out of whack,
43 and the resultant is a creature too terrible to describe; a creature whose only course of action is destruction, and yes
44 there goes Tokyo. That, pure and simple, is my definition of cerebral rock. Now the Doors: Led by a drug crazed mad-
45 man who considers himself a poet, a keyboard crazy with sideburns measured in acres, a guitarists who had to kiss Jim's
46 feet in order to be allowed to play, and a drummer who couldn't hold a beat if his life depended on it. Into the 
47 morass of the Sixties this group fell, and, beyond all hope of reason or logic, became a hit. Songs like 'People are
48 Strange (and I'm no exception)', 'Lizard King (I can do anything)', 'Waiting fi for the Sun (I've nothing better to do
49 today)' and that all-time big hit 'L.A.
50 Woman' convince me of the neurosis and helplessness of the band and of their leader James 'I love Miami' Morrison. 
51 I just wish that had gone east to see the czar a few years earlier. And on a side note, not ALL of their songs are
52 bad, BOC made an excellent cover of Roadhouse Blues, far surpassing the original effort, of course.

68 Geez...
69         Evidently you don't read what you write.... Or don't understand what
70 you read....Or don't write what you understand....Enough circular logic !
71         In examining your last repartee I am convinced that one or more of the
72 above must be true, otherwise how could one account for the blatent 
73 misunderstanding and re-statement and of the obvious. The reasoning follows :
74 1) " he calls ME the unsigned one ! " - D.U.W.Y.R. as all my messages contain 
75 my signature. Yours don't. 
76 2) " you may think you are using some secret code " - D.U.W.Y.R  I don't think
77 I am ...I know I am.
78 3) " you're the only one who knows it." - D.U.W.Y.R.  A statement of fact not 
79 in evidence. The solution is elementary, therefore any number individuals 
80 could be in possession of the "answers".
81 4) " pompous weirdo " - D.W.W.Y.U.   .... The lowest form of flattery.
82 5) " Call me illiterate will you "- D.R.W.Y.R. & D.U.W.Y.R. & D.W.W.Y.U.
83      Only at YOUR insistence !

116   case, I still vote for Tom Lerher's "Poisoning Pigeons In The Park" as
117   the number one top hit from the sixties.  (Does anyone remember Tom?)
118   And while we're on the subject, there's Tom and Dick Smothers, with their

141 After the PCS Social, I walked out to the Eastgate.  Saw the Guardian, and we
142 ended up talking about the goings on here, right?  Well, after a while, he told
143 me what he thought about my series of numbers.
144     Those aren't mine.  I never entered them.  It was lucky I found out about
145 them, hopefully I can rememdy this.  I am not the one entering series within

179 that P-147 will prove to the the long-sought panacea, capable of curing all known diseases without side effects-"
180    Frank threw the remote control down on the couch. Jean picked it up and continued flipping through the channels,
181 stopping on every channel that showed the news in one form or other. Hell, the news was more interesting than anything
182 else on TV. It never failed to surprise.
183    Things were getting out of control.
184    The world had changed almost beyond recognition in the three weeks since Jean first saw the sun rise in the west.
185 War, poverty, hunger, disease had all but vanished. Earth was well on its way to becoming a true utopia, which was fine
186 except... would it stop there? And Frank was slowly becoming convinced of one thing: These changes were not as random
187 as they first seemed. Somebody was controlling them.
188    But who?
189    He sat back down and rubbed his eyes tiredly. God, if only he could wake up! the whole world was being pulled out
190 from under him like a rug and as far as he could tell, only himself, Norbert and Jean realized that anything was amiss.
191 Every one else accepted the changes that faced them every morning when they woke up as if things had ben that way all
192 their lives. He put an arm around Jean protectively. His worst nightmare was that he would wake up one morning and find
193 that she was gone, indeed had never existed anywhere but in his mind. As a consequence, Frank slept even less well than
194 usual these nights.
195    Jean had stopped on another channel showing the news. Something in the broadcast dragged Frank from his dark
196 contemplations.
197    "-the madman known to the public only as Nom De Guerre was shot to death today in his latest attack on novelist
198 J. D. Silverman. De Guerre has attempted to kill Mr Silverman three times in the past five years for reasons still
199 unknown. De Guerre reportedly stepped out of an alleyway and fired a single .45 caliber slug which struck Silverman
200 directly in the skull but miraculously ricocheted off. Silverman drew a concealed .38 derringer and shot De Guerre
201 twice in the chest, killing him instantly. Silverman was reported in satisfactory condition at Woodland Park hospital.
202 Confronted by reporters, he stated, quote: 'People always said I was hard-headed.' end quote. Police are withholding De
203 Guerre's true identity pending notification of his family-"
204    Jean sighed, "Too bad. I wish De Guerre had nailed him. His novels are the most pretentious, obnoxious crap I have
205 ever-"
206    Frank tuned her out, thinking. he had heard the same opinions before, and not just from her. But who did he know
207 that was a Silverman fan? Most people he knew either didn't care how the long-running De Guerre/Silverman conflict came
208 out or actively rooted for De Guerre. Silverman was a third-rate hack novelist whose only real claim to fame was a
209 highly publicised and probably staged feud with an anonymous madman. But he knew someone who was a Silverman fanatic,
210 raving for days on end about his latest project. Maybe the person who was pulling the strings of creation was a
211 Silverman fan. It was the only explanation for his miraculous survival. But who? Someone he had seen recently, he was
212 sure. Had this person been connected with the experiment?
213    All the pieces fell into place and a cold chill of realization ran deep into his guts. It all made sense. The one
214 man they hadn't heard from, the man on whom the whole experiment had hinged. Somehow, he had managed to gain control of
215 some horrible power, and was now using it to reshape the world in his image. His face chalk-white, he turned to Jean
216 and shakily began, "Honey, I think I just-"
217    There was a sudden frantic hammering at the door. Shocked, they both froze and stared for a long moment. Frank
218 finally got up and opened the door cautiously. Norbert stumbled in, headfirst. He grabbed Frank by the shirt and tried
219 to gasp something out. Frank could see in his eyes that this was a man pushed almost to the edge of sanity by
220 something. He grabbed Norbert's shoulders and shook him. "Get ahold of yourself, man! What's the matter?"
221    Norbert tried once more to speak, but only a faint wheeze came out. Suddenly, all the panic drained out of him at
222 once as he collapsed in Frank's arms in a dead faint.

339 Unnoticed the Innkeeper had been poking around beneath the deformed 
340 panels of the damaged transport. Occasional sparks flew from the 
341 borrowed tools. "Hey Bard, have you got a spare stablizer around here
342 someplace?" his voice floated out from under the panel. 
343 "What?" responded Bard. "What are you doing? Get out of there, your
344 going to damage the controls!" "I doubt that they can be damaged any more
345 then they are now. Do you have that stablizer or not?" "No, there isn't 
346 one, so don't bother trying to fix it. We're doomed to this place 
347 forever" moaned Bard.  Ignoring Bards obvious distress for the destruction
348 of his valued transport I continued to work on the stablizer. #Maybe I
349 can fix it enough to get us out of here# a voice in my head said.
350 A limit detector bypassed here, an overload device there. A mass of wires
351 began to grow under the control panel. Finally two large wires were
352 strung out and ran into one of the medical regeneration units. "There,
353 that should give us enough power to get this heap moving. Reaching
354 towards the panel I threw the switch. a loud humming noise became 
355 evident followed by the smell of scorched wiring. The air began to take
356 on a redish glow then rapidly moving up the spectrum towards the ultra-
357 violet. Unknowing the intentions my hand moved of its own accord to the
358 panel and set the coordinates for home. Home? What is home? I don't even
359 know where I am let alone where home is. The controls moved, and the 
360 transport began to vibrate. The panel exploded in a shower of flames,
361 the lights went out, and I felt like I was being torn apart cell by cell
362 until I began to think I could stand the pain any further. Then as if 
363 in response it got even worse. I was being turned inside out. 
364 As suddenly as it started it stopped. I fell with a crash to a dirt floor
365 I heard others around me, apparently they had made the trip as well where
366 ever it was we went. The transport was gone though, no sign of it, only
367 my own self and the others around me. Slowly my eyes began to have vision
368 restored to them, and I began to make out the outlines of where we were.
369 It seemed awfully familar for some reason... there was a wall in front of
370 me with a rack holding many rows of bottles upon it. Some of them covered
371 with years and years of dust, while others were obviously newly placed.
372 My back leaned against a cask of some sort, the plug digging into my back.
373 "Where am I?" I said out loud. "Where is this place?" I heard a smothered
374 chuckle from above. Looking up I was surprised to see hiding in the rafters
375 a smallish elf grinning from ear to ear and now laughing out loud. "Why
376 the jollies?" I asked. "I can't bare it! I can't reavel the naked truth!"
377 was the only response I got. Looking down I quickly realized what was 
378 ment. My clothes had not made the journey with me, and I quickly covered
379 myself such as I could. "This isn't funny!" I said to no one in particular.
380 For the first time the voice in my head did not answer. I then began to
381 realize that the presence was no longer there. Apparently it wasn7t only
382 my clothes that didn't make the journey either. Using a cloth that was 
383 laying across one of the casks I covered myself, and then looking up 
384 again at the elf sitting on the beam holding it's sides. I demanded
385 "where am I? what is this place?" Between chuckles and snorts I got the
386 answer "Why dear Innkeeper, don't you recognize this place? Surely you
387 would not forget the many hours you've spent here climbing up and down the
388 stairs over there." As I looked in the direction pointed I already knew
389 the answer. I was home in my own wine cellar. "I'm home" I wispered...
390 "I'm home!" I shouted as I ran for the stairs.  "Welcome home friend" the
391 voice behind me trailed off. I barely heard it as I rushed up the stairs.
392 I was home.

394 Milchar-I will try to find it. Forgot to tell you-the logic probe works backwards for positive logic, and negatively
395 for negative logic-except for C-MOS, in which case you have to move the switch to pulse, except when tracing DTL, 
396 in which case, you need to wire in a pullup resistor in series with the probe tip. 330 ohms will do, but remember to
397 bypass it with a .0047 uF capacitor.
398 L'homme....Well, where were you? And I was so eagerly awaiting your arrival (A friend of Max...)
399    Once upon a time, there was a young man who lived near a babbling brook, across a bridge, and behind a stand of
400 mystical magical trees.
401    Well, one day, as he was contemplating the alleged immaculate conception of oranges, he decided to start a computer
402 bulletin board. He named it backwater, because (?) he lived behind the babbling brook. 
403    The whole kingdom was amazed, and soon people from far and wide, uh, I mean near, heard of this marvelous inter-
404 change of human (?) expression...
405    Well, it came to pass that some members of the royal (?) court (?) decreed that the sacred writings should be pre-
406 served for posterity. (A fancy word for something or other). 
407    So, he began to record these words of wisdom (?), and, upon request from the throne, made a sacred promise-that
408 one day, these treasured writings would be made available to all the people...
409    And it came to pass that it didn't come to pass...
410    And that is the end of the story...
411 Promethious- Voyeur was just kidding about not getting any worse...

431 As I can see you people can not appreciate good or classic (not
432 classical) music, I think I had better explain something to you.
433 The Doors music represents everything that was good and bad
434 in the 1960's.  Apparently some of you children were not around back
435  then to know what I am talking about.
436 The reason they used The End as the theme song for Apocalypse Now
437 should be obvious for any person that has any sense of feeling for
438 what the movie was about.  You people are supposed to be so
439  cultured and knowledgable about the media and life.
440 You people are even stupid enough to think that the air strike was 
441 called in at the end of the film.
442 Get real.  If you would have been awake or had your head out of your
443  popcorn, you might have noticed that Sheen turned the radio off as
444 "All-mighty" was calling "PBR Streetgang".  There was no air strike
445  called in.
446 You people can't appreciate classic music of the times and you can't
447 even figure out one of the best movies made.
448 Grow up people and think about life.

457 As I recall the movie, the air strike was set up along the lines of a
458 "dead man" switch.  That is, the strike would take place UNLESS called off by
459 PBR Streetgang.  His act of shutting off the radio was in effect calling the
460 strike.  But that's OK, mr. Morrison, we understand.  You were brain-damaged
461 even before you died over a decade ago.  That's what makes your music so
462 evocative, I guess.

471 Brain dead my friend???
472 Brain dead is for the folks in the White House who sent our boys into
473 Nam with nothing better to do but die.
474 
475 Your idea about the Dead Man switch is unfounded but possible...except
476 for one problem.  If you will recall, the Streetgang was also
477 to give coordinates.  These coordinates were calculated by
478  Sheen as he found Gantz.  How could H.Q. know where to drop the
479  pills if they themselves were not sure where Gantz was?  Granted they
480  told him that they believed he was in Cambodia, but they were not sure
481  enough to send in the 52s.  No way.
482 There is no question to discuss, the fire lines at the end of the
483  film were simply a backdrop for credits.  They were showing what
484  was all too common over there -- death.
485 Not the death of Gantz's followers, but the death of an American dream.
486   The death of the idea that America can win any war that we enter.
487 The dream that will die if we play Khadafy's game.

545 Unfortunately, on this board at least, the third is not true, but the message from the nil intelligence known at Big Jim (I
546 guess that's what the crowds in Miami thought) would tend to support RS's third contention. If you really believe that crap
547 about the air-strike being a backdrop for the end credits, I submit you have listened to Morrison Hotel one-too-many times. 
548 Apocalypse Now is based ENTIRELY on the story Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad in 1902. The story is based on a
549 journey Conrad took through the Congo in 1889-1890. Conrad described the journey as 'experience pushed a little (and only a
550 little) beyond the actual facts of the case'
551 (in relationship to the story he later wrote.) If YOU can't see the similarity between the dark continent and southeast
552 Asia during the Vietnam conflict, I further submit that this conversation should cease because one side (your side) is wholly
553 undermanned. A.N. is more a modern version of a great story set 70 years after it was written in a different jungle under 
554 similar conditions than it is a 'tribute' to the Vietnam war or the people who fought there. Jim, you need to start recognizing
555 the differences between what comes out of Hollywood, revered city that it is, and what we call reality. Of course, that has
556 always been a difficult concept for you, as can be heard in your music.
