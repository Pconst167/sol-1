32 Gezzz, I almost made it to the top! Or is it true that Cistop Mikey doesn't
33 count? As most seem to be in agreement about the fact that our friends at 
34 Rancho Rajneesh have been about as devious as a bunch of crooks can get let's
35 elevate ourselves above the "Nuke 'em 'til they glow" stage. (Tho' that is a
36 very tempting thought) I propose that the we contact the ACLU and sic 'em on
37 the big bawg and his fellows. Being both an Oregonian AND an American citizen,
38 I feel that I have been personally slighted and slandered by the generic
39 statements sheela has made in regards to the state of Oregon and those of us
40 who have lived here before they came along. After all, did any of her ancestors
41 help secure this nation and the principles on which it's founded. Do you feel
42 they would do so if we called on them? I don't. It's a religous cult that's
43 using our Constitution and bill of rights to worm their way into the state and
44 local governments. THIS is what was meant by seperation of church and state.
45 Do you honestly believe that they'll stop once they've gotten another "mile"?
46 I could attempt to draw parallls  of how many fo the tactits they use are very
47 similar to those used by a certain German leader during the thirties and fortys
48 but that would be a baaaaad thing to do. Incidentily, did you know that ol'
49 Adolf was followed with a most religous zeal, being compared as the "NEW"
50 Messiah of Germany?

53 The juggler of digits sat at his usual table, back in the corner of the Inn,
54 near the fireplace. These chilly days of approaching winter made him huddle
55 closer to the warmth of the fire. Idly his finger drew mathematical symbols

57 moisture.

106 O.K., then here's something serious: This year, as has been the case for evey Presidential election in my lifetime,
107 the American public is being asked to make a choice for the lesser of two evils. Let's face it: neither Ronald nor
108 Fritz is fit to preside over a PTA meeting, let alone the Government of the United States. Perhaps the cynic spoke
109 truly when he said that no man fit to hold the office of President would ever be fool enough to seek it. 
110 I don't know about you folks, but I've had enough of being asked to pick my favorite circus clown to decide my fate
111 every four years from between two men who don't even have simple entertainment value. When Pat Paulsen ran for 
112 President a few years ago he said if we were going to put a comedian in the White House at least we should pick a
113 professional. Maybe that's true, but I don't want a comedian either. What is needed is a better way of choosing 
114 Presidents -- a Presidential draft. Let's pick some set of criteria we desire in a President, then establish a 
115 group of people who meet those and select from that group AT RANDOM, the chosen having no more choice than a military
116 conscript as to whether or not they'll serve their term.
117 Until this rational form of selection is adopted or (Fat Chance) a qualified candidate chooses to run, I intend to
118 vote "None of the Above" for President. I reccommend that all who feel as outraged as I do do the same. Just imagine
119 if they held a presidential election AND NOBODY WON! Maybe WE'D finally be the winners.

121 I am not too concerned about what the Rajneesh do, it's the agreived expression on their faces when someone stops 
122 them.... (When WE do it, it's GODS will, when you do it, it's the Devils work) I get the same &^%*^&* from the 
123 fundamentalists...  Also I am disturbed by the Rajneeshi's theft of other groups  Words-of-Power.  Zorba the Buddha,
124 Jesus Grove, Waldin Grove, etc.  It makes me uncomfortable.  The only cure is to
125 sit down and write a check to the Salvation Army, send a street person home for Christmas.

161 Milchar ran along the path made by the crimson beam, having no other means to travel, and was determined to follow it
162 to the end.  He almost missed the Friar as he passed.
163 "Milchar... you missed dinner!  I have a guest now, Madame D... Won't you stay a bit and talk?", the Friar said.
164 Milchar, wanting this questing to end, said, "Sorry... I must go... Take care of the others...  I'll be back...", and 
165 continued his running.
166 While he leapt over rocks and ducked under low branches in his way, Milchar pondered what the voice had said.  He tried
167 to make a Sign in the air, which promptly fizzled like an novice's.  "Knowledge is still there, just the Power gone..."
168 Milchar mumbled to himself.
169 Milchar began to notice his surroundings.  He saw the great beauty of the Valley once more, and cursed the evil 
170 invading it.  He comforted himself with a promise to end the evil, and enjoyed the scenery.  A brook, a glen...  
171 Milchar broke through the brush and clambered into the open.  What he saw shocked him.
172 He was quite near where the gazebo was.   The only remains now were scorched timbers that had fallen beneath the violent
173 breath of the emerald force.  A few of the timbers still smoldered.  Nothing was salvageable.
174 The crimson ray from the necklace veered west now, toward the cliffs.  "The camp!", Milchar cried.  In a sudden burst 
175 of speed, Milchar flew over the ground as if by magic.  Milchar never noticed the faint glimmer from his Argentium ring.

178 "You can call me Lila," I said to the Friar. It's not my name, but it's got
179 a musical sound and my identity is fluid these days.  I took the monk to be
180 a Fransiscan by the simplicity of his dress and by the concern he evidenced
181 for some trees he had planted. However, he cooked too well to be a perfect
182 ascetic.  We were in a lush valley, very different from the arid mountains
183 where I had just been. Here life needed no coaxing--the valley was teeming
184 with gorgeous foliage, flowers, birds, and entities of light-maybe just a
185 trick of atmosphere, maybe a life-type.  
186 "Have you come here to make a settlement?  It's a beautiful place. Where are
187 you from?  What are you looking for?  And where are the others?"  There were
188 some odd things about the valley.  All of the plants were new to me.  There
189 was no litter of old leaves and twigs on the ground and the ground itself was
190 loose and light, a cross between sand and styrofoam.   A swirl of red light
191 swooped toward us. The Friar hailed its inhabitant, but he didn't or couldn't
192 stop. (I'm not the only one with spotty magic.) He muttered something about
193 a quest.  Quaint language for such a futuristic place, but quests and heroes
194 and villains and journeys into the unknown never go out of style. What were
195 we to learn here? For the first time I noticed a spire of rock towering from
196 the valley floor.  It looked out of place and I felt compelled to gaze at it.
197 I listened to Friar Mossback explain the expedition and continued to stare
198 at the rock. The sweet air, the Friar's voice, and the imposing tower made
199 me feel lazy and happy.  I let my senses flow without thought without care
200 without end.

232    The early morning frolic out of the way, the piper felt the pangs of hunger
233 coming on.  Banking sharply, the pegasus swept up the valley looking for signs
234 of the party.  Although they had taken pains to be less than fully visible from
235 the ground, it's hard to imagine what you look like from the air -- much less
236 be able to blend into the surroundings.  Accordingly, it was a simple matter 
237 for the piper aboard his aereal steed to locate the good friar.  That worthy
238 gentleman seemed quite engrossed in conversation over the breakfast table.
239   Leaving the pegasus cropping grass a short distance away, the piper quietly
240 walked up behind the friar, and was quite gratified to see a rather violent
241 start when he asked, "Is there any breakfast left, or has it all been eaten?"

244 Leonard - Well, in looking back upon past memories I find you to be correct.
245 It's a pity that there isn't a Rights Infringement Agency, the ^&*$%#! we
246 know as the U.S. government has an agency for just about every thing else!
247 JCS - Unfortunately, by voting for none of the above you defeat the "system"
248 devised to effect change (albeit questionable) in our society. Given the so=
249 called choices I too, find it hard to choose. But choose we must and come the
250 6th of November those who vote will decide for those who don't. What really
251 galls me is that one canidate says he'll raise my taxes, draw the line at the
252 heavens (no escalation from either side? SNORT!) and in general give me the
253 same government I served in the Air Force. I some how just can't swallow a
254 political rerun. I don't much care for the other choice but he's put people
255 back to work, bllstered a crippled economy and for the time being, reinstilled
256 in most of us a little more pride in being an American. Either party, sooner
257 or later is going to produce a person who can get our government to do what
258 it's supposed to do and stop doing what it shouldn't. I won't attempt to list
259 the all too many ways. Whooooops!! My soap box just broke again, anybody got
260 a tube of super glue?

272 Fin: You are wrong. Voting for none-of-the-above does have effect.
273 First, they do have to count it (I checked it out) as the law requires
274 that they count all write in's. It has as much effect as voting for
275 Pat Paulsen or Mickey Mouse. (Admitedly not much, but it does count)
276 I also disagree that I 'must' vote for one of the clowns neither of 
277 whom I feel is qualified for the job. And in fact the system most 
278 definatly does not say I 'must' vote for one of them. That is what
279 we have the write in box for. Next, as far as impact, yes they do
280 keep track of those who didn't vote for either canidate. This has a
281 impact on their decisions. If the number of abnormal votes increases,
282 they know that there is a higher level of dissatisfation by the voters.
283 I will not vote for Ronnie 'kill them' Reagan nor will I vote for
284 Fritz 'ignore the problem and it will go away' Mondale. I could vote
285 for Pat Paulson, or Mickey Mouse, but I have no reason to desire either
286 in the White house. and since None-of-the-above is just as effective,
287 that is what I intend to vote.
288 On to other things.... I am utterly amazed that Mondale would think
289 that the Russians aren't going to build space weapons just because
290 he doesn't want to. (This after they recently just finished testing
291 of a killer sattilite.) I find it even more so amazing after they 
292 even proved that they would continue to build during his tenure in
293 the white house when the Carter administration was in its disarmament
294 mode. Not only did they build, but they stated flat out that they 
295 were happy about it because they were able to get ahead of us in 
296 weapons deployment for the first time. Obviously when you are dealing 
297 with this type of mentality, unilateral disarmament is of no value
298 at all. Of course on the other side we have Reagan with his ichy 
299 finger just waiting the punch that button. And you think I have
300 to vote for one of these clowns? Forget it!!!

369 Ah, but the point is, that I don't feel that it has anything to do with
370 'Lesser of evils'. I don't feel that either canidate is qualified for
371 the office. Which is why I refuse to vote for either one. With Reagan
372 playing Russian roulete, and Mondale burying his head in the sand, I am
373 frightened at the prospect of either one being in the office.

376 Hmmm... just wait until I tell my Government teacher about this.  I'd probably be assigned an in-depth study of the
377 effects a nationwide 'None of the Above' vote would be.  Well, maybe I won't tell him...
378 ++++++++++++++++++++
379 The glow from the ring faded as Milchar sped closer to his destination.  Milchar suddenly realized he wasn't even tired-
380 some magic had sustained him enough to bring him this far.  "To what?", Milchar asked.
381 Again Milchar broke through the brush to a clearing.  A procession of what could only be tanks moved slowly down a road,
382 the whole moving toward the south end of the Valley, nearer the camp site.  An evil-looking man was perched utop the 
383 lead tank.  He was wearing an emerald necklace quite similiar to Milchar's own ruby one.  A spark of energy flew from
384 one to the other, as if the necklaces recognised each other.
385 The spark immediately drew the man's attention.  He rapidly barked orders, and the remaining tanks drew around in a 
386 semi-circle around him.  The man disembarked from the tank, and walked closer.
387 The features of the man's face were plainer now, it seemed that he had been brutally attacked with a knife at least 
388 once, and probably more times than that.  His clothes were of strange design (anyone see what "cool" people are wearing
389 today?), and he wore a gun of some sort at his side.
390 "Mage, you have interfered enough with my plans.  I shall have all of the tokens, and Knowledge shall be MINE!!"
391 "You shall have to battle me first.  Alone."  Milchar spoke the words, and knew ty were true, but knew not where they
392 came.  "A contest of wills."
393 "A contest of wills.  Begin!"
394 Waves of force erupted from the necklaces, shot from the sparkling gems.  The forces met and tore at each other.  
395 Swirls and eddies of force tore huge gashes in the ground.  A few of the man's unlucky henchmen were caught in the 
396 battle.  None lived long.
397 Both contestants were sweating from the strain.  The violence of the battle swept up higher and higher, the very ground
398 beginning to quake and shudder in pain.  Still they persisted.  Still they fought.
399 The man screamed, and drew his gun.  Two blasts are lost in the maelstrom the battle has created.  One hits a mound of
400 dirt dug up from the forces.  The last hits the center of the maelstrom.
401 The maelstrom begins to move toward Milchar.  Slowly at first, it moves to tear apart the very fiber of his existance.
402 Fustrated before, Milchar is enraged.  His passion consumes him.  His efforts redouble.  A faint gleam from the ring
403 returns.
404 The force of the storm engulfs Milchar, it appears to be the end...
405 The storm is shred from the very air, destroyed by an argent scream from the ring.  Streaks of argent smite the 
406 remainder of te storm.  Shrieking, the man dissolves in a cloud of emerald force, leaving the necklace behind.
407 The clouds disissapated.  Sunlight returned to the Valley.  The man was no more.  His tanks had fled long ago.  Only 
408 the necklace remained.
409 It flew through the air, and merged with the ruby necklace.  The union glittered with a golden afterimage.
410 "Two thus joined, half thus made."  Another true statement that Milchar uttered without knowing the source.
411 Not knowing where to go next, Milchar decided to return to the camp... but... he was... so very tired...........
412 ++++++++++++++++ Milchar ++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 11:29 on 10/24/84 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
413 Hurumpph.  A long and violent entry.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Milchar +++++++++++++++
414 A rather interesting idea came up during a bull session at work. How about a
415 voting system where you get one vote for every dollar in taxes you pay?
416     Obviously, you'd have different #s of votes in Federal, state, county, school
417 district, etc elections. 
418    It would end the complaints about people and corporations using "tax loopholes".
419 An odd but perhaps useful side effect is that corporations would be allowed to
420 vote. (of course, the STOCKHOLDERS would have to vote on the vote...)
421    Just think, no more arguments about welfare cheats and bums voting for higher
422 taxes so they'd get bigger checks...

424 	Bard and Lucifer had been seperated from the party during the flight
425 from the gazebo. Finding themselves in no immediate danger they had been 
426 wandering the valley ever since, drifting as first one thing and then another
427 caught their attention.
428 	The latest attention grabber had been a quite spectacular light show at
429 one end of the valley. IDue to the lack of shadows nearby, Lucifer had not been
430 able to shift very often, thus the display had ended before their arrival.
431 	They reached the scene in time to see Milchar slump to the ground. Bard
432 dismounted and examined him.
433 	"He's ok. Seems to be simple exhaustion.... We'd better TRY to find the
434 others, Lucifer."
435 	The black unicorn replied, #I smell the friar's cooking. We can be there
436 in a few minutes.#
437 	Piper was just sitting down to a plate of hot food when Lucifer stepped
438 out of a nearby shadow...

441 The Poet had been walking for the last half-hour or so, having decided (after about a mile) that whatever had
442 blown up the gazebo wasn't interested in him. He was just beginning to relax and enjoy the scenery when more
443 explosive noises came from the rear, spurring him to greater speeds. Risking a glimpse over his shoulder, he saw
444 waves of green and red energy leaping into the sky. Obviously there were some very heavy power levels involved,
445 for where the colors passed before the sun they completely hid it from view, momentarily casting the valley into
446 green and red washes of light. The strobing effect took it's toll on the Poet's visual perceptions, and he tripped
447 over a protruding tree root and crashed in a heap to the forest floor. Realizing he was hopelessly outclassed by
448 SOMETHING behind him, he was momentarily undecided about whether to get up and run on or just huddle there and
449 wait to see if he died soon. Then the words of an old teacher came to him: "the essence of defense is information.
450 God himself can be defended agianst if you can find his weak point." At first he couldn't think of how this was
451 relevant, then it occurred to him that the scanner device that'd gotten him INTO this mess was still in his pocket.
452 He couldn't use it to leave here, it's power supply was too small, but he could still take a look around...
453 Milchar! Just dusting himself off after a victory, from the look of things. And approaching him were the Bard and 
454 a unicorn or some such beast. Hmm. Better scan for some other power readings in the area...Ah! There's a camp 
455 with the Piper and that monk-fellow he'd seen in the Inn, plus some folks he didn't recognize. Eating! That's the 
456 number one priority after I finish checking things out... A high reading from that pinnacle of rock, try to focus
457 in a bit better...   There was a loud *POP!* and a cloud of blue smoke rose from the Poet's pocket. SOMETHING had
458 overtaxed his little monitor's systems; systems that'd been sufficient to transport several large masses of matter
459 between realities. Whatever it was, it was putting out more power than the Poet cared to think about on an empty
460 stomach. Maybe they've got some ale, too, he thought as he trudged off in the direction of the camp.

463    The piper had not realized just how hungy he was until the first bite of
464 food entered his mouth.  His companions watched in amazement (and perhaps a
465 touch of fear) as he began to engulf what for him, was inordinate amounts of
466 food.  Even the shuddering of the ground and the red and green flashes that
467 lit up the immediate area did little to slow the quick flashes of his fork and
468 knife.  Luckily, no one reached in front of him -- no limbs were lost, no hands
469 impaled and sliced, no fresh protein in the piper's diet...

472 To all you Reagan supporters.....Why don't you get your facts straight!!!!!! 
473 the only reason that there have been some jobs created under the present
474 administration is that 
475 so many more were lost in the first year, and it is still going on.
476 Reagan hasn't done a damn thing for the economy..True interest rates are higher 
477 than under Carter... Morgtage rates were 10% under the last administration
478 but now are 14% and rising. When Carter/Mondale were in the interest on my
479 VISA was 12%, now its 24% . The car (U.S.) that I bought in 79 had an interest 
480 rate of 8.9% while the one I bought in 83 carries a 20.5% rate.
481 As to inflation being under control, just check around. A '79 Mustang cost 
482 $6500.00 (aprox) fully equiped. the same model today is over $12000.00. 
483 Almost doubled in just 3.5 years. The figures used by the government the
484 state the rate of inflation are just that figures and have no bearing on fact...
485 If you can believe an administration that bars the press from Grenada then you 
486 can believe Ronnies boys and their figures. Just go to any grocery store
487 and see all the price tags ontop of other price tags, These arn't reductions!!!!
488 As to voting for 'none of the above' IF YOU DON'T VOTE...DON'T COMPLAIN!!!!!!!!!

492 You don't understand do you? I am voting, I am just not voting for one of
493 the jerks that have been provided for the circus show. My vote for
494 none-of-the-above will have the sam impact as voting for Pat Paulsen, or
495 Mickey Mouse. To vote for ronnie or Fritz is a cop-out for me. I 'WILL' 
496 vote my way NOT yours! But the way, I am interested in YOUR figures.
497 I blame Ronnie for a lot of things, but NOT the resession. It was coming
498 along quite nicely until he got in office and then all of the sudden it
499 started to get better. If you truly think that someone can wave a 
500 magic wand the minute they get in office and make the interest rates
501 and money supply chnage overnight, I really do wonder where you
502 got your economic training from! Also, my VISA has always been 18%
503 the only change has been the additional $25 service charge. Also,
504 when I bought my car in 1975 I payed 14% interest. When I bought
505 one this year I payed 13.75%. And whenever I have looked into 
506 home morgages they have always followed the prime rate. 
507 In May 1983 I quit working for Edge Technology which was faltering. NOT
508 because Reagan was in office, but because for the prior two
509 years it had been unable to make a profit. Why? Because nobody was
510 buying product. Because they couldn't afford to. All the money was
511 being tied up in tryig to survive. A company doesn't fail overnight.
512 it takes time. You borrow money to survive. Then when you can't borrow
513 anymore, you start cutting back. When all the money is going to service
514 the prior debt built over the previous years, there is none left to
515 buy things. That is when the economy begins to show falting to the
516 average man on the street. These changes don't happen overnight.
517 They take years to build up. The companies that were buying from
518 Edge were strapped not because of the current situation, but
519 because of things that had happen earlier. When you look at that,
520 it comes out to be around 79/80 the final legacy of Carter/Mondale
521 to the American people 'a resession'. Which is yet another reason
522 why I don't feel Fritz is qualified for the office.

559 I refuse to believe that my voting "None of the Above" is any more empty gesture than voting for Fritzie. Of
560 course neither will win, but even so millions will vote Mondale, as is shown by the response on this board. I am
561 convinced that it is my responsibility as a citizen to vote for the best candidate available, and in this situation
562 the best choice is "None of the Above". I am prompted by the same feeling of inherent wrongness in the situation
563 that would prompt me to respond to the choice between being shot or poisoned with a simple "no, thank you". The
564 choice we are being offered is no choice at all, for electing either one is inviting national disaster in one form
565 or another. Every vote counts in the election. I plan to let them know that I feel the best candidate to become
566 President of the United States is None of the Above.

568 I recall a statement from the debate. (I didn't watch since I was at work at the time) During an ad for Mondale they
569 had him asking Reagan about various items such as the "star wars" defense plan, etc & then when Reagan said he didn't
570 know, that it wasn't his job to know, Mondale responded with 'it IS the president's job to know'.  BULL! We cannot
571 expect the president to know all the details about EVERYTHING. If Mondale intends to try, then he is a fool. As much
572 of a fool as the president of a company, who tries to direct the fine details of the
573 day-to-day operations. The proper job any kind of chief executive is to handle the broad details and make sure that his
574 sub-ordinates are carrying out policy properly. It is also to SET policy. Reagan isn't doing to well on some of this.
575 But from those statements, Mondale intends to RUN THE COUNTRY PERSONALLY! He is either a fool, or thinks we are. 
576 	I do NOT entirely care for Reagan, but if I have to vote for Reagan or Mondale, I'd vote Reagan. Since there are other
577 choices I may vote for on e of them (the Libertarians keep making gains in every election, I wonder if this is why?).

587      You are being grossly misinformed today on a vital historical issue - an issue which, because of the threatened
588 repercussions, is almost impossible to challenge.
589      It has literally been made into a sacred issue; the dogma of the age.  Implanted in your psyche by a resolute
590 media blitz of incredible proportions, either you accept it as given in all its myriad allegations oo you keep your
591 doubts to yourself.
592      You can publicly argue, refute or ridicule anything else you wish . . . anything at all.  But you must take
593 extreme care not to openly question what has been thrust upon you as "the most awesome, unspeakable event in history"
594 - an even alleged to have occured over 35 years ago and because of which the western world should forever debase itself
595 in shameful regret: The "Holocaust."
596      What exactly are we talking about here -  this "Holocaust?"  What's the anatomy of it? Why is every attempt to
597 delve into its true nature met with such raging counter-attack? Why does one literally take one's own life into one's
598 hands by simply pointing out that the "holocaust" allegations just do not fit the facts?
599      How does such a campaign of fabrication affect you as a citizen, a taxpayer, a thinker?  Consider the billions
600 upon billions of your tax dollars given annually to prop up the state of Israel, a state controlled by a certifiably
601 irrational leadership that threatens to plunge the Middle East and possibly the entire world into a new war.
