28 doesn't want to confess...  So much for
29 amenities, whomever (I can't remember)
30 had that book he took the stuff from,

50    The Hell Machine
51          (5)
52    
53    Frank and Jean sat huddled together silently on the bottom step of the stairway in the lab, still trying to accept
54 what they saw. The process was constantly interrupted by noises from the upper lever. Finally there was a grunt and a
55 loud crash followed by a curse of appropriate foulness. Annoyed, Frank called up, "What the hell are you doing?"
56    Norbert appeared at the top of the stair, sucking his hand. "Dismantling the experiment."
57    "Why?"
58    "You have got to be kidding!" he replied, aghast. "If somebody else got ahold of this thing-"
59    "Dammit, Norbert," Frank snarled, "We have no proof that that mess is our fault or the experiment caused it! Just
60 lay off!"
61    Norbert came down and sat beside him. He placed a hand on Frank's shoulder and said quietly, "Do you really believe
62 that? Or are you just afraid I'm right?" He turned and glared Norbert. Norbert suddenly felt a little afraid. After
63 all, Frank was about twice his size and in a very unstable mood at the moment as well. But this was important. He had
64 to make him see. "Just think for a minute. Reach down deep inside and tell me what you feel. What I think we all feel."
65    Frank was still for a long moment. When he turned to Norbert, his eyes were full of fear. "I did feel it. Right when
66 it happened. My first view of that cloud out there gave me a feeling of deja vu. But that's impossible. You can't know
67 something before you find out about it."
68    "Mountains don't vanish into thin air, too."
69    "My God," He whispered, "What have we created?"
70    Jean finaly spoke up, having heard enough. "You're both crazy! I'd expect that sort of thing from you and your
71 comic-book mentality, Norbert, but you should know better, Frank!" She got up and backed away from them like they were
72 mad. "Thousands must have died from that! And you're saying we killed them! I will not take responsibility for that!"
73 Frank got up and went to her but she kept backing out of his reach. "Don't you realize what you're saying? We
74 disintegrated a mountain? A whole mountain? That kind of power lies only in the hands of God himself! All those
75 people..." With a muffled sob she bolted through the door.
76    Frank stood there, staring out the door. Norbert finally spoke. "She feels it, too. It was like a telepathic link
77 between the four of us and the machine. We knew what it had done, only we're just now realizing it. I think that scares
78 her more than anything else. You'd better go to her."
79    Frank glared at him. "You're the one who stirred her up. This is a rotten time to go spouting around a lot of
80 semi-mystical bulls**t! And I don't need YOU to tell me what to do!"
81    Norbert watched him stomp out the door angrily. He was just edgy. They were all edgy. They had created a device of
82 unbelievable destructive power. Perhaps infinite. Only a madman wouldn't be bothered by that. Norbert was amazed at how
83 easily he accepted the whole situation. The others would come around in time.
84    His thoughts were interrupted by a loud snap from the front of the lab. Doug had finally managed to pull the cube
85 from its mount, which he had been trying to do all this time. He brought it over to Norbert, and asked in a childish,
86 almost pleading voice, "Mine?"
87    Norbert looked at the cube. It appeared unharmed but the power surge had surely fused the imbedded circuits. It was
88 nothing more than a paperweight now. All that work, gone. Handing it back, he sighed, "Sure, why not?"
89    Doug's face lit up and he handled the cube like it might break at ny second. Norbert envied him his ignorance of the
90 situation. The guy might have only half a brain but at times like this it was a definite advantage. He didn't have to
91 deal with it at all. Not that he really had to feel guilty, anyway. He was just a volunteer. Blameless.
92    But one thing kept sticking in his mind. Like Jean said, power like that only rested in God's hands.
93    Until now...

99           Sometimes I look back at still ponds or steams hidden behind
100 brush and overgrowth.  Or I will try and wade my feet into the water.
101 It's not an ocean-ice feeling, but not the same as months ago when I
102 could wade with pants rolled up high.  The warm feeling of the lake-
103 bottom sand between my toes was a pleasant, gentle sensation.  
104           Sometimes I look back and a timy smile will steal across my 
105 face, quite without my knowing it, until somebody asks why.  And to
106 this I can only say I was thinking of old times.  Then I stopped to
107 wonder about such different way of communicating, such a different but
108 effective way.  The honesty behind a mask.  And I wonder why.
109           Sometimes I wonder why I wandered away.  Why I strayed from 
110 the stream and lake.  But, I don't know.  Just wandering from place
111 to place.  When one setting gets tense, just keep wandering until 
112 another dry rock is found in the middle of some other river, rafar away.
113           And, every once in a while, I have to look back with a tiny
114 smile or a frown, and wish I hadn't wandered by--and could still say "hi"
115 to an old friend.
116 /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\
117 oops, enter only. -t
118 You can always say "hi" to a friend. For a true friend does not forget
119 that they are a friend. They don'forget when there is nothing left to
120 take. For a friend does not take, a friend only gives. That is what is
121 important, the giving of friendship. That is how you can tell a friend
122 from just someone you know. Do they welcome you with open arms when you
123 just happen to drop by after being away for a while, Or are they put out?
124 You my friend are always welcome. When you need to go you need to go,
125 when you need to come back that's wonderful. Welcome friend.

138 did not function perfectly. The main problem is in scrolling. CL+ scrolls
139 the screen but the ANSI control codes say "don't scroll!" The graphics, the
140 colors, the lines, the cursor movement: all are fine. I reinstalled 3.08A

230    Just another quiet night at the Inn. With most of the most interesting
231 patrons gone through the mysterious door beside the fireplace, things had
232 gotten downright boring. The few patrons left sat at their tables sipping their
233 drinks quietly, the assistant innkeeper tiredly polishing the bartop with a
234 worn rag. This, alone, would have been sufficient reason for the patrons to
235 take an interest in any newcomers. But this particular newcomer gave them more.
236    To begin with, he appeared suddenly, silently. One moment the doorway was
237 empty and the next he was just standing there. Nobody had heard the door open
238 or close. What got their attention was the deadly chill breath of wind that
239 heralded his arrival, cutting through everybody in the place like a razor.
240    He stood tall, about six-one, plus another inch for the hiking boots he
241 wore. He wore a long, grey coat open to show a red silken shirt. His pants were
242 blue denim, and  if he carried a weapon it was well concealed indeed. It might
243 have been in the large backpack he was carrying on one shoulder. His face was
244 young, largely bereft of the lines a well seasoned traveler might sport. It was
245 a warm, friendly face that would have looked quite out of place without a smile
246 which, fortunately, it wore.
247    He looked around at them for as long as they looked at him. He seemed quite
248 harmless, and quite unmagical, so they soon lost interest, although his
249 unorthodox entrance caused some discreet talk among a few of them.
250    Tiring of the admittedly mundane view, he sauntered over to the bar. "And a
251 good afternoon to you, my fine man. This appears a nice, uh," He scanned around
252 once more, uncertainly, "friendly place." He dug deep into a pocket and came up
253 with some coins. Slapping them on the counter, he declared "A flagon of your
254 finest ale, if I may be so cliche'."
255    The innkeeper scooped up the money. "Be as cliche' as you want, as long as
256 your money spends." He set the great wooden mug on the counter and the visitor
257 took a long draw from it. The brew was quite powerful, much more so that at
258 most such establishments, but if the newcomer was surprised, he didn't show it.
259 "What is your name, stranger, and where do you call home?"
260    The newcomer wiped his mouth with a clean sleeve. "My home is far indeed
261 from this prestigious establishent, and I have had many adventures between
262 there and here. I would tell you of them, but I understand that a few here
263 would loudly complain if I were to launch into a lengthy tale now. Perhaps
264 another time."
265    The innkeeper nodded, a bit sourly. "You're probably right. A few of the
266 patrons have been getting out of hand lately, though we're slowly but surely
267 cleaning them out."
268    The newcomer nodded, taking another swig. "I have an aquaintance who would
269 be delighted to hear that. He recently left in considerable disgust. As for my
270 handle, I am known formally as Zebediah Quincy Kelzer, but you may call me...

273 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
274   Clarification time:
275 Just to help sort things out, this is the situation as I see it:
276 In the bard's transporter, we have the piper, the bard, Cragmore, Milchar,
277 the innkeeper and the alien.  (Zephyr -- I thought YOU had called him
278 blue-skinned -- but blue goes better with a chlorine metabolism, doesn't it?)
279 The transporter is lying, somewhat the worse for wear, in an alien laboratory
280 where the former (after being transformed from his normal teddy-bear shape
281 into something that is not clear) has just rapped on the door.
282 What is unclear -- is this laboratory on the chlorine-atmosphere world, or
283 another?  If it's chlorine atmosphere, most of us are in trouble (exept the
284 innkeeper and the alien).  If we're in oxygen, the alien may be in trouble.
285 Clarification anyone?
286 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
287 I thought the alien had a breathing apparatus. How carefully do people read?
288 Ever since the Destroyer, I doubt people have thought it reall worth reading
289 anything here.........
290 ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
291   The sun rose slowly over the distant mountains.  The snow created a
292 white blanket over everything in sight, only a few tracks from little
293 bunnies and the tall forest pine could be seen.  Guzmar turned to see if
294 he was still being followed.  Only a little bit more and he could find
295 cover in the forest ahead, got to keep moving.  
296  
297   The faint barking of dogs were heard, Guzmar picked up his pace, got
298 to keep moving.  He couln't feel his feet it was so cold, a nice
299 warm fire and some hot cider sounded better than ever before.
300  
301   Guzmar was now running in and out of the tall pine trees.  He stumbled
302 and fell almost every twenty feet, as the dogs were getting closer.
303 Guzmar stopped neer a tree that had a lot of branches near the bottom, he
304 tried to climb it but his fingures were too cold to grab anything at all.
305 Oh his hands hurt trying to move them.  He fell into some snow covered bushe
306 below.  He could here the dogs and they had been onto his trail for hours
307 now.  Guzmar was running out of ideas, he reached into his pocket where he 
308 kept whatever magical items he had; He collected them, not knowing what
309 some of them were, a few were from his father.  He fumbled around until
310 he found the one he was looking for.  His grandfather gave him this and told
311 him never to show it to anyone else and to only use it in great danger.
312 The bad thing was his grandfather never told him how to use it, he wasn't
313 old enough yet.  He took it out and looked for something to press.  The
314 dogs were now in the forest and getting closer.  His cold fingures felt
315 around for a hidden catch that he remember his father showing him a long
316 long time ago.  The dogs were close, Guzmar had his fingure on the hidden
317 plate but couldn't press down hard enough.  He looked over his shoulder
318 and saw the dogs racing towards him through the thin covering of bushes.
319 He had to get it on this try or it would be all over for him.  With a
320 last effort, he gave it all he could and pressed the plate.
321  
322 gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
323 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (tails and tales recognized)
324 Guzmar:  I hadn't seen that story in over a year.  I hoped you would return...
325          If you one and the same, that is.
326 Entropy: You'll never believe this, but there's a site in my livingroom!

354 To: Keeper of souls.  If you would reread the entries in question you will
355 see that some unsigned person left the comment about giving one's name
356 to a witch. This is followed by apprentice's top border. 
357 If a person is leaving an entry after one that doesn't have a border, it is
358 customary to place one's *own* border (minus name) at the top of one's
359 msg to indicate the change of authors.
360 Partial borders (20-40 columns) are sometimes used to seperate portions
361 of a msg.
362 _____________________
363 (like that)
364 You are the only person on the board (& as far as I recall in the board's
365 entire history) to put his name in the *top* border. A few have placed
366 the name in both top & bottom borders.
367 You might get a better reception if you try the following:
368 1. Use lowercase.
369 2. Use 70-80 column lines.
370 3. Spell things properly! (I had to reread one line three times before I
371    could figure out what you meant)
372 _______________________________
373 To: All		Subject:huh?
374 I assume that *someone* left a particularly *outrageous* entry earlier.
375 If anyone saw it and is willing to discuss it, I can be contacted 
376 (privately) on Blue Parrot or Le Nerd or CBBS/Aloha.

400     Piper, I found now flaws in your summary.  The laboratory is filled with
401 breathable air from the Former's atmosphere generator.  It is set to the most
402 productive state.  It sohuldn't run down for a long time.
403     The laboritory is part of the alien's home.  It seems to be a mushroom
404 of alarming proportions.  We are in the hollowed out portion of it's large
405 top part.  It is white inside, and seems to be circular, around the stool.
406 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
407     The vehicle was a shambles.  Strips of the hull kept peeling off and
408 hitting the floor.  The racket was loud enough without the Former's pounds.
409 Tiny gadgets and mechanisms were falling from where the strips left the
410 insides exposed.
411     The Bard popped his head out.  The Former, quite taken by suprise, stared
412 at him.  The Bard inhaled timidly, and decided it was alright to step out into
413 the laboratory chamber.  The Former watched him, and realized with a start he
414 was staring.  So he looked inside instead.
415     How so many people got into that vehicle at once was beyond the Former.
416 Like tiny clowns, emerging from a car, the party filed out, one by one.  The
417 Former would have asked, if he hadn't noticed the alien step off the craft.
418     What would it say to the intrusion of it's home?  What would it do to
419 the Former as punishment?  Whatever the case, he swallowed and prepared for
420 a chlorine scolding.

437         Guzmar pressed on the plate with all of his might.  In a whirl
438 wind and light, Guzmar was hurled end over end.  After a few seconds
439  wind stopped and the light was gone.  Guzmar found himself in a very
440 ifferent enviornment.  The air was warm and there were voices all around
441 .  
442        If Guzmar knew it or not, he was now sitting in a popular Inn
443 lled backwater.  People were surprised to suddenly see a small man sittig
444  a table with his eyes closed and snow on him.  You never know what the n
445 will bring in next.
446         Guzmar didn't like this, he prefered being in control of what hapnd
447 o him and what he was doing to himself.  But just think, where else coul
448 is take me?  I could go anywhere.  Too bad there isn't a way to control
449 !
450         "Ah, but there is, there is."
451         Guzmar looked up to see a shadow standing against the smoky air f
452 e Inn.  A very tall man and huge!  As guzmar was looking for a fastest wy
453 t of the Inn, the tall stranger sat accross fro

456 The Phantom Glitch returns... I see you amatures are playing with "Magick" 
457 again... sometime, if you dare, try the real stuff.... Serial Ports!

459 Cereal Ports?  Is that where Captain Crunch docks his ship?
460 Perhaps he is there to meet General Mills.
461 Winstead------------------------------------------------------------------->
462 P.S.  You've got guts.... getting on them for spelling it "magick".  That
463 may be an archaic spelling, but at least it is one.  Is "amatures"?  Urk....

466 Everyone within the craft piled out.  The room outside the craft looked like...
467 well, like the interior of a fungus covered with smaller fungi.  The smaller
468 fungi did not appear to be doing well in the rich oxygen atmosphere.
469 As he always did, Milchar quickly scanned the area as he entered it.  Great
470 Spells and Staves, that was the Former!  Milchar thought back.  He hadn't seen
471 the Former since...hmmm, again the Ruby Valley.  The memories of that trip 
472 popped up often nowadays.  Shelve the thought for later, Milchar decided.
473 Cragmore exited the craft, and Milchar briefly experienced a stab of pain.
474 Almost automatically, he sent out little tedrils of thought- and recoiled
475 immediately.  Sometimes exhaustion was a good thing.  If Milchar did not spend
476 effort, he could not sense the mental screeching that Cragmore gritted his
477 teeth against.
478 Now would be a good time to sleep, Milchar's treasonous body implied by 
479 swaying slightly.  The mage found a place to sit down and listen to the
480 others sort out the situation.  Just a...few...more......seczzzzzzz.

578 IAW THE DISCUSSION ON "MAGIC" AND "MAGICK" AND THE TWO WORDS DO MEAN THE 
579 SAME THING AND MAGICK IS THE ARCHAIC FORM OF THE WORD IT HOWEVER HAS COME 
580 TO WRK LIKE THS:
581 		MAGIC: THE ART OF STAGE PRESTIDGITATION (STAGE MAGIC)
582 		
583 		MAGICK: THE ART AND PRACTICE OF THAUMATURGY ( RITUAL

587  Now the question that comes to mind, is the Karmic Record a sequential or
588 random access structure?  How does one of these talented people do a 
589 Hardware Initialize? CTRL-ALT-BELLY_BUTTON? Since a ritual is a program,
590 can it be compiled? What language are they written in? FORTRAN666?
