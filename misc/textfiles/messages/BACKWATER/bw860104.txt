20 He had been climbing for what seemed like forever.  His poor equipment and
21 the skis on his back made it difficult to move well.  Finally, and incredibly,
22 he discovered there was no more mountain before him.  He stood there, looking
23 out over the vast distances, the hazy blue horizon, the clouds like an ocean
24 below him, and the purpose of this great endeavor - the pure white utouched
25 snow spread out in every direction.  Just waiting for one person to pass
26 across it, leaving his mark, saying to everyone, "I was here first.  This is
27 MY mountain.  Everything the rest of you do from here on is merely a reflection
28 of what I have already done."  
29    He put his skis on, checked the bindings, then studied the surface before
30 him.  Satisfied at last with his plan, he pushed off, and began moving down the
31 slope.  Turning, turning, floating in the powder, floating in the ecstacy of
32 being first.  Suddenly as he passed across the snow hiding a crevasse, it gave
33 way and swallowed him up, and he was never seen by mortal man again.
34       From below, other skiers who shared his zeal for being first studied the
35 mountain.  There appeared to be a slight blemish near the very peak, but for
36 all intents and purposes the snow was still intact, waiting the primal touch.

    So much for the interesting political debates.  It is a mark of those who
86 debate, that their eventual debate comes down to a hackneyed argument of which
87 computer is racially superior.  Of course, I am no better, so here I go.
88     It depresses me when movie reviewers dictate that a movie must either be
89 good or bad.  There is no fair, in movie reviews.  And people seem to think
90 the same thing of personal computers.  Commodore are only a little less usefull
91 than an Atari 800 and yet you will see the respective owners locked in mortal
92 struggles to defend the honor of their own coomputers.

148         Slipping through the quite streets, Miranda felt good.  Finally,
149 she was doing something on her own.  She had never really been able to
150 do anything alone before.  She had spent most of her life in exile with
151 her father on a lonely isle, but was always watched over by her father
152 or one of his spirit-servants.  She learned a lot about taking care of
153 herself then, but she never felt like she had been tested.  There were
154 always the spirits around to make sure that she was never in danger. 
155         With their return to Milan, Miranda's world changed radically; 
156 suddenly she had to deal with hundreds of people and the busy activities
157 of a major governmental city.  To try to keep some semblance of the
158 quiet isle, she kept to the confines of the home, but then she didn't
159 have the room to roam that she despairately desired.  To make up for it,
160 she ventured into her father's library.  There, Miranda had found a
161 place to let her mind roam.  Now it was again time for her body to roam
162 though, and she was on her way to start her adventure.
163         In the dark streets, Miranda saw not a soul.  She knew that it
164 wasn't safe for her to be out after dark, but she felt confident that
165 her powers would keep her safe.  After all, she'd practiced everything
166 that she had learned.  So busy was she at thinking of how safe she was,
167 Miranda didn't even hear the two men behind her.  She did see the stars
168 explode in her head, though.
169 
170         "Uuhn", Miranda said dizily a couple hours later.  "Where am I?"
171         "Ssshhhh!"  Came the insistant answer.
172         Looking around, Miranda saw many colors.  She tried to rub her
173 eyes to bring the colors into focus and found that her hands were tied
174 behind her.  Slowly, vision returned on its own, and the colors turned
175 into an old man playing solitare.  As more colors came together, Miranda
176 found that she was in a small dirty room with several other young women,
177 also tied, but all unconscious.
178         "Who are you?" she asked the old man.  He looked at her bleakly
179 and shushed her again.  "I said, who are you?"  She whispered it this
180 time.
181         After a long empty stare, he said  "I'm your guard."
182         "Why am I here?"
183         Another odd look.  "You don't know?"  She shook her head.  "You
184 are soon to become a representative of Milan to the harems of Arabia."

189 One Long Saturday...
190     (Part 6)
191     
192      It was full dark by now. Jim had been driving around aimlessly for the last hour or so. His six passengers had
193 been silent all this time, which was fine with him. He didn't feel too talkative at the moment himself. The whole world
194 would soon be destroyed (Conquered and enslaved! Why couldn't he get that right?) and his attempts to prevent it had
195 been completely futile. As far as Saturdays went, this one sucked.
196      After more driving, Amogo finally spoke up. "This is the fourth time that we have passed this particular landmark.
197 Where are you taking us?"
198      "I don't know."
199      Jim turned right instead of left at the stop and found himself coming up on a local resturant. He had been too
200 busy to eat all day and his stomach suddenly realized that. He pulled into a spot in front of the door and got out, not
201 caring if the aliens followed or not. Of course, they did, and Jim found himself holding the door for them without even
202 thinking about it. It was about an hour before the Saturday rush was to start, and the place was almost empty. Good
203 thing, as his entourage probably would have caused a panic. He took a nice, dark corner booth and the aliens crowded in
204 with him, three on a side. Just one big happy family.
205      The waiter showed up a few minutes later, a high-school kid with more pimples that brains. He stared at Jim's
206 company for a full minute, growing steadily paler by the second. "Wh-wh-what are t-t-those?"
207      Jim assumed a stern demeanor. "This," he said in his best lecture voice, pointing at the aliens, "is what happens
208 when you take large amounts of controlled substances over a long period of time. You don't take drugs, do you,
209 son?"
210      "N-no sir!" the kid swallowed hard. "I just quit!"
211      "Good for you!" Jim said. He sliped a menu out from under the waiter's arm (since he seemed rooted to the spot)
212 and glanced through it. "Aw, hell, just gimme a large pepperoni pizza with the works and seven cokes." Then he put the
213 menu back under the waiter's arm.
214      After he left (rather hastily), Amogo spoke up again. "I'm afraid I have a confession to make. I told a slight
215 mistruth about our mission here."
216      "Oh, yeah?" Jim's interest had definitely been raised. "Then what are you here for?"
217      "Well, in the past, we have discovered that to conquer a planet our greatest challenge lies not in the world's
218 military might but in the populace. Some peoples can be amazinly stubborn and clever in the face of invaders. We were
219 actually sent here to test the resourcefulness and ingenuity of an average human being, like yourself. This was to be
220 the true guage by which we measured this planet's value for occupation."
221      Now Jim knew how the waiter felt. It took him a moment to get his mouth working in synch with his brain again.
222 "You-you mean all this time you knew I was trying to do you in?"
223      "Of course. You appear to have badly underestimated our level of intelligence."
224      "I'll... be... damned..." Jim wondered, rubbing his chin. "That's why you went along with me. You knew you'd be
225 able to survive whatever I threw at you."
226      "We hoped we would, anyway. We were to sacrifice ourselves, if necessary. Had we not returned, the invasion might
227 have been postponed or cancelled. This planet would have been classified too dangerous to contact."
228      Jim was quiet for a moment. He had been right all along, more than he knew. Of course, they had known what he
229 would think, obviously. Not only were they smarter than he thought, they were a hell of a lot smarter than he was. "I
230 suppose you've got some kinda special fate in mind for me for everything I did to you."
231      "Well," Amogo said with a chilling matter-of-factness, "We do have something particular in mind for you..."
232

256         The girls were gone and the mother was scooting off after them by the
257 time her story was over.
258         "Let mme get this straight, someone is going to maim your husband,
259 maybe kill him, and you don't care?"
260         "I care.  I care about his will.  If the old lump does die and his will
261 leaves me destitute, I care,"  She was ice cold.
262         "As long as he's alive and well, you are as rich as he is, that right?"
263         "Essentially,"  Her look dripped icicles.
264         "And I'm supposed to save him, and in doing so, save your purse,"
265         "Essentially,"  The ice cracked,  "Must you say that?"
266 
267         He swallowed the last drops of his soup and dried his mouth with his
268 napkin.  Throwing it onto the table, he said yes.
269         He strode over the carpet and then the marbe and was soon down the

290 .....
291 The problem with government is that it IS a business, but it's not run like 
292 one. If everything were run like the free enterprise system, we'd be making a
293 profit instead of being so in debt. That's why I voted for Reagan, warts and
294 all. I felt he was so free enterprise oriented that he would try and steer
295 government that way. Apparently, it's an impossible course to take.
296 
297 But it's a simple fact that unless human beings are motivated by profit and/or
298 reward for doing things right, they generally won't. That's why big government,
299 government aid, etc. (i.e. the democrats who want big brother to take care
300 of everyone) is so stupid and will never work. Profit is the only motive.
301 
302 Furthermore, there always must be a lower class. All cannot be equal. Poverty
303 Poverty that is, can never be eliminated, because the lowliest workers will 
304 always have an existence below the rest. But poverty is very subjective, how
305 many starving Africans would give their left nut to live the life of one of
306 our poverty-stricken peoples? We can only do so much, and there are those who
307 will crawl under the lowest form of life as long as you let them.

387 Where are all the hopes we had
388 Which, in youth, we knew would last?
389 What has happened to those words
390 That we vowed to speak?
391 We still have ever question;
392 Yet the answers we still seek.
393  
394 The dreams have died within our hearts,
395 Growen cold and hard with time.
396 The fire of our youth's great hopes
397 Is smothered in the brine.
398 And all the words we vowed to speak,
399 When life was young and dear,
400 Died in silence, for they were
401 Words no one wished to hear.

413 AT LAST, AN OPERATING SYSTEM!(MIKEY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN) ANYWAY, TO THE ABOVE
414 ON GOVERNMENT: YOUR COMMENTS INDICATE A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OR THOUGHT ABOUT YOUR
415 IDEAS. FIRST, THE GOVERNMENT IS RUN LIKE A BUSINESS, TRUE. IT IS ALSO LOSING 
416 MONEY AT A RATE THAT WOULD BANKRUPT AN ORDINARY BUSINESS. HOWEVER, THERE IS AN
417 EXCELLENT REASON FOR THIS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT THOSE IN 
418 CHARGE ARE COMPETENT. THIS IS BECAUSE WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PRODUCES IS 
419 / ARE PRODUCTS THAT NO PRIVATE BUSINESS COULD PRODUCE AND MAKE A PROFIT ON. 
420 TAKE THE POSTAL SYSTEM, WHY DON'T FEDERAL EXPRESS, OR ANY OF THE OTHER PRIVATE 
421 MAIL SERVICES ATTEMPT TO EXPAND INTO THE FIRST CLASS MARKET, IN A COMPETIVE 
422 MANNER? THE ANSWER IS THAT NO PRIVATE ORGANIZATION COULD PROVIDE THE SAME MAIL 
423 SERVICE OF THE SAME MAGNITUDE THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE, AND
424 EXPECT TO MAKE A PROFIT. IF ONE COULD, IT LONG AGO WOULD HAVE BEEN FORMED, AND
425 ESSENTIALLY PUT THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE OUT OF BUSINESS. THE SAME PRINCIPLE
426 HOLDS TRUE FOR ROADS, DAMS, POWER LINES, MILITARY GEAR, AND SO ON. FURTHER,
427 WHENEVER THE GOVERNMENT VENTURES INTO A SERVICE PROVIDING AREA IN WHICH IT 
428 COULD HOPE TO MAKE A SMALL PROFIT, IT IS QUICKLY CROWDED OUT OF THAT AREA BY 
429 PRIVATE INDUSTRY.  SO, THE GOVERNMENT ENDS UP PROVIDING ALL THE PRODUCTS AND 
430 SERVICES THAT HALF THE PEOPLE WOULD AGREE WERE NEEDED, AND PRACTICALY NO ONE
431 WOULD AGREE TO PAY FOR.  IF YOU LOOK AT IT, THERE IS REALLY NO WAY YOU CAN 
432 ORGANIZE THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE MONEY BETTER THAN PRIVATE INDUSTRY, SO IN A
433 COMPETIVE FREE MARKET, THE CONCEPT OF AN EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT IS LUDICROUS. IF
434 YOU WANT AN EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT, MOVE TO RUSSIA, THEY ARE VERY EFFICIENT AT 
435 DOING THE ONE THING THAT GOVERNMENTS CAN DO WELL; REPRESS THEIR CITIZENS.
436 THERE ARE MANY THINGS WRONG WITH OUR GOVERNMENT, BUT INEFFICIENCY IS NOT ONE OF
437 THEM. RATHER, IT IS THE PREVALING DEMAND OF SOMETHING FOR NOTHING THAT IS AT 
438 THE ROOT OR OUR BUDGET PROBLEMS. AND THERE IS ONLY TWO SOLUTIONS FOR THAT, 
439 RAISE TAXES, OR CUT BACK ON SERVICES, OR BOTH. YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY.
440 THE QUESTION REALLY IS WHICH WILL IT BE?+++++++++++++++++00000001TED+++++++++++

442 Oh, God, not a political debate! That's even more boring than computors!
443 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

444    Ahh, politics!  Love it.  Personally, I believe that the US government 
445 is much too efficient and productive.  It produces laws, promulgates
446 regulations, and issues paperwork at an astounding rate.  Does anyone here
447 have the date that more than 50% of the working population shifted from
448 "productive" jobs to government?  
449   Alternatives?  It's not original, but I favor a limit on the absolute
450 number of laws a government is allowed.  A bicameral legislature, of
451 course -- one house writes the laws, while  the other (the house of
452 dunces) rejects those they can't understand.  If they want a new law,
453 they have to eliminate an old one, or combine it in an understandable way
454 with an old one.
455   Sigh,  I wonder how many laws I've broken today?

463 TED, How on earth can you say money can't be made from Power lines, dams,
464 military gear, roads, etc? Of all the things you mentioned, only roads are
465 or can be initiated and regulated by the government. All other goods are
466 produced by profit-hungry private industry for use by citizens and regulation
467 by the government. The government is the largest buyer of military goods, and
468 their needs turn companies like Rockwell and Honeywell Avionics and MacDonnel
469 Douglas into multi-billion dollar concerns. Power companies, who are under
470 regulation by the government, are also very large and rich companies. Ever
471 heard of Detroit Edison, PGE, and PPL?
472 First and foremost, Government supplies citizens with items they can not
473 easily supply themselves. These items are courts, military protection, public
474 services (and that is now questionable), international monetary logistics
475 (also questionable), social service, welfare, and democratic leadership.
476 Unless a private concern can provide something like medicare and social
477 security for the entire populace of the country, the government will be 
478 forced to handle it. Unless private industry can raise armies to defend
479 national interests such as pipelines and oil fields, the government will
480 have to do it. Until someone chas a better idea, government must continue
481 administering laws and handing down punishment. There are some things that
482 a society can not handle on its own without having a separate entity to
483 administrate those tasks. This leaves out the profit motive debate entirely,
484 but it is important to distinguish between private industry working for and
485 with government from governmental pillars like Social Security and revenue
486 collection. In every organized group of people as far back as history will
487 take us, men and women have formed governments, and those governments have
488 dealt with taxes and laws and the military and social need, just as ours
489 does, and just as any future government will find itself doing.

494 
495         You of course remember old Milt Famie? He was that sensational pitcher
496 in the late forties. His first year out as a rookie saw him climb up the
497 ladder, until at the end of the season, he was pitching in the world series.
498  
499         Well, Milt had a method. He never told anyone, but it eventually came
500 out in all the publicity around his downfall. (More on that later). Anyway,
501 it was the second game of the series. The first had been a no-hitter. Quite
502 a feat for a rookie. The second game went the same, no hits, no runs, etc.
503  
504         This remarkable record continued right up to the fourth game. This
505 would be it. The first time in history... a no-hitter series. The pressure
506 was on. The fans were ecstatic, and the opponents (no one remembers their
507 name now) were at their peak, ready to stop this deadly trend. Now we can
508 tell of Milt's secret... He drank beer.
509  
510         Every time he went to the mound, he would secret a bottle of beer
511 in his mitt. Whenever he appeared to be wiping the sweat from his brow, he
512 was actually sipping a few suds. No one knew...yet.
513  
514         The top of the ninth came around, and so far the opponents hadn't had
515 a hit. Then came the first pitch of the inning. A ball. The second was a ball.
516 The third, and finally the fourth pitches were all balls. The crowd was in a
517 frenzy. A base was taken by the opponents for the first time in the series.
518 The pressure was even more severe. The second batter came up to the plate.
519 The pitch... and it's a ball too. The second batter eventually walked to
520 first. The manager called a timeout. Milt came in, and got a pep talk. He
521 went out again, but... with another bottle of cold brew. He was worried, and
522 he needed it now more than ever.
523  
524         Well, the third batter was walked too. Now the bases were loaded. The
525 next batter came up to the plate. The crowd hushed.... Milt sweated.... wound
526 up.... and threw. A hit! No, a home run.... four runs in one pitch.... A
527 Grand slam.... the no-hitter series was now unattainable. The crowd rose as
528 one and booooooooooed.
529  
530         The end came fast. The other team wgn that game, and because Milt's
531 team was morally wiped out, they lost the next three games and the series.
532 At the end, the truth came out, and Mylt was banished forever from playing
533 professional baseball.
534  
535         But the beer he drank lives on in history, as "The beer that made
536 Milt Famie walk us!"

549 Ted
550 There is nothing more pitiful than some
551 one who cries "your comments indicate a lack of knowledge" when their own
552 comments and apparent knowledge are far from expert. Keep it on the amatuer
553 level Ted, because you're far from  an expert yourself.
554 As the other gentleman pointed out, often services ARE farmed out to private
555 companies because the government is far too inefficient to do them on their own.
556 And you ask why no one will do the post office's job? Simple! The government
557 won't let them! You wouldn't believe the hassle UPS had and has to go through
558 just to compete with the post office. And anyone who has ever used both systems,
559 as I have (extensively), will tell you that UPS runs circles around the post
560 office. Why? Free enterprise, profit motive, you can be fired for screwing up,
561 etc. Other in-city delivery companies have attempted to deliver mail, only to
562 be halted by the postal system!
563 Now, I'm not going to say we should eliminate the postal system altogether, just
564 make it more free enterprise oriented, as perhaps it already is more than most
565 government systems. But take defense. Billions of dollars wasted. Just plain
566 wasted. Why? There's no incentive to make money, each department is in fact
567 obliged to SPEND all it gets, or else it might not get as much next year! So
568 why not make each department its own profit center, with rewards going to the
569 departments with the most money left over AND the proper functioning equipment
570 in stock and working?
571 
572 I'm not saying that government has no place, but it cannot EVER run efficiently
573 unless there is incentive (or threat of punishment... speaking of which, do  you
574 know how hard it is to fire a government employee? You might as well call up the
575 white house and ask to talk to the Prez as get one of those guys fired). There
576 may obviously be some areas where government simply has to  take taxes and spend
577 them, but almost without fail incentive systems could be implemented in any
578 given area and make it more efficient.
579 
580 And to the law guy... I agree totally. As President Reagan once said in a speech
581 in Anaheim about ten years ago... "There oughta be a law against saying 'there
582 oughta be a law...' "

607        The one thing that I get a good laugh at is how secretive our
608 government is supposed to be!  Give me a break.  It is so huge and hire
609 our to so many private contractors it would be impossible to keep a 
610 secret from getting out.  And now they are so hard on the few that ar
611 are caught for selling out secrets to other countries.  One more thing,
612 are we still keeping track of who is getting secrets and what country
613 is getting all of the weapons?  I didn't think so.
614        Not to change the subject but what is the purpose of the US giving
615 out so many military hardware & knowlage?  We shouldn't be worried about
616 other coutries, we are being our worst enemy!
