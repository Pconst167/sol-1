 24 At last, at the top!  HAHAHAHAH!  I dood it.
 25  
 26 It's way too late to be up, but I have the chance and am enjoying it.
 27 It gave me the opportunity to listen to KGO's Ray Taliaferro.  KGO is
 28 a San Francisco AM radio station, so the only way one can listen is
 29 at night, very late and toward the early morning, on the old E-layer
 30 skip signal.  It's very interesting.
 31  
 32 I don't think "Liberals" are any more connected to the truth than the
 33 "Conservatives".  Ray is considered by many to be a "Liberal", but somehow
 34 I trust what he says more than I trust some idiot rod like Rush Limbaugh
 35 or (remember) Peter Weissbach.
 36  
 37 Maybe it's because the radio talk conservatives seems to put themselves
 38 up on a White Horse (tm) and Go To Bat For You (tm) while making money
 39 off you.  Ray seems to exhort me to think for myself.  
 40  
 41 I am much more likely to give an ear to someone who says "This is the
 42 truth as I can find it...but if you want to think what you think already,
 43 go ahead.  It's your life" than someone who says "I'm gonna save you from
 44 the <_____fill in blank______>".
 45  
 46 To the Limbaughs and the Weissbachs of the world:  Sure, I appreciate
 47 you a-gettin up on your White Arab Charger (tm) and Fighting For Me (tm
 48 applied for).
 49  
 50 But who asked you?
 51  
 52 Weissbach always began his show with his oft-repeated slogan, how he'd
 53 "prick the pretensions".  I got the overwhelming impression that he'd
 54 been listening to so much of his own press, he had some pretensions that
 55 needed pricking himself.  
 56  
 57 -----------------------------=Justin the Blue=---------------------------
 58 I can think for myself.  When I need the Self-appointed White Knight Brigade
 59 to come to the rescue, I'll call on ya, thanx, though.

107  I'm very curious how anyone without a chip on thier shoulder can even
108 come close to imagining Irvington as a Little Berkeley (with all that the
109 tag of Berkeley implies).  Anyone who spends any time in Irvington would
110 know better than to say something silly like that.
111  I lived in the Irvington area for a while.  Little Berkeley it is not.
112  
113  BTW, would the person who left the message surrounding the  "Little Berkeley"
114 comment please figure out some way to upload the message so that clumps
115 of characters AREN'T dropped off.  The rest of it was utter gibberish
116 ...I got the upshot, but it gets tiresome trying to decode the thing to get
117 the nuances to discuss it intelligibly.
118  
119  I saw the rowhouses in Corbett Ave. area too.  I don't think the named
120 city councilors are making as much as one would believe...as a matter of
121 fact, I'd be surprised if they were in on the deal at all.  
122  
123  One should be careful when laying blame at people's doorstep.  If done
124 incautiously or in rage, it makes one's comments look like blathering
125 and renders it invalid.  If they really offended or hurt people, there
126 would have been some sort of objection.  And since there weren't...what
127 the hell are we supposed to do about it?  There are every number of people
128 saying we should get upset about something, but the thinking person needs
129 to know why, and how...and why haven't YOU done something about it yourself?
130 Otherwise, it's just rally the natives and give 'em torches, and march on
131 the castle.

161  Yah, I know.  Who cares.  Pleases me, anyway.
162  
163  I got a little radio for Xmas.  It's just a little AM/FM stereo unit,
164 pocket size, earphones, good reception.  Here's a spiffy thing: it`s
165 case is clear plastic.  You can see all the coils, the tuning stages,
166 the IC chip (Toshiba...go Japan!  Yeek.) that replace the howevermany
167 transistors that it used, and the little tiny squirrel that power it.  
168 It's fun to look at.
169  
170  Short shameful confession: I am a talk radio addict.  I like to listen
171 to just about anything; I am a talk radio gourmand, more accurately.
172 I miss the KGW talk format.  Getting KINK on AM is really just of benefit
173 to those downstate and who don't own FM recievers (remember such a time)?
174 Even though Wessbach got on my nerves, I enjoyed him; I liked Uris even
175 though he got a little tweedy at times; my favorite was Rick Miller.  
176 Remember him?  As my mom would say: so dumb, he's funny.
177  
178  The subtraction of KGW talk radio from the scene leaves a big void
179 locally.  KXL has a lot, but it's a national network at night.  KGW
180 let a lot of local loonies and clear=thinking folx talk at length about
181 what they thought affected them and it was always entertaining.
182  
183  Even Norman, from a phone booth in Southeast.
184  
185  Besides, I won a prize in Rick Miller's cheezy game show once.  A KGW

216 Hospitals make me ill.  Doctors and nurses have no sense of humor.  "You cant 
217 leave" they would say.  That's what the men said in the alley the night before
218 I was admitted there.
219  
220 Police want to know how many were there when I first noticed them.  I dont tell
221 them.  I dont think I can really recall.  There were the two who I stopped, and
222 then the three who put me in the hospital.  The rest were just part of the 
223 crowd, like the rest of the world.
224  
225 I'd like to thank the man who called the police after the boys took my wallet 
226 and boots, but it was an anonymous call.  Perhaps he's hoping I'll go by there
227 again for his entertainment.  Or perhaps he's next on the admissions list.

243   Rohrshach, dear boy, if you were to "put the city out of its misery",
244 the "Law" wouldn't be the only folx who would be just a little unhappy
245 with you.
246   You write well.  Your style shows mastery and potential.  Your
247 perceptions show depth.  Your attitude is lousy, and your point of view
248 is just wrong.
249  
250   (Now into a general mode), I've often wondered what goes on in the
251 minds of folx who seem to be so anxious to see the dark side of everything
252 that they see the bright side of nothing.  
253  
254   Am I saying that we should all delude ourselves into believeing that
255 Life[tm] is Wonderful[tm]?  Hell, no.  There is pity and degradation
256 and rot all round us, but there's no need to wallow in it.  It must
257 be paid heed, however.  The attitude the the negative must be
258 hyperemphasized and hyperexhibited is just as bad as the attitude that
259 anyone who shows concern in hints of bad fortune is unAmerican.
260  
261   Take a look at a coin.  Ever notice it has two sides?  Ever notice
262 how nothing seems to have less than two sides, and frequently more?
263 Not only are there folx on thier last legs and dying of poverty in pdx,
264 but there are also those who are doing obscenely well.  More importantly,
265 there are those who are working to make the bad in this town not so bad,
266 or at least to give those who are on the negative side the chance to change
267 thier lot if they wish to, those who are trying to rescue those unfortunate
268 to be thrown to the winds of chance against thier will.
269  
270   Remember those unfortunate good people at Colvera Villa, who were going
271 to get tossed out on thier ear at Christmastime?  Most of them made it out.
272 Three units are still occupied by good people unfortunate enough to have
273 no way out, and they are going to wait out the eviction process.  Meanwhile,
274 the trust fund set up by Conant and Conant Booksellers, which got wide press
275 and many promises, is all the way up to $200 or so!  After only a month!
276 Wow!  What's next?  $205 by the 15th?  [heavy sarcasm here, everyone] RSVP
277 Management, the people who bought out the Colvera Villa, have pretty much
278 forgotten thier promise to donate money to this fund.  These people need
279 help.
280  
281   Does anybody out there really feel there's rot in our town.  Here's a good
282 place to start.  The folx I mentioned above are in as much trouble as anyone
283 can be, bereft even of the security that they will have a roof over thier heads
284 in less than a month.  How about donating some cash to this fund?  Instead of
285 contemplating one's navel over how bad it is, we can eliminate it...or at least
286 do our part.
287  
288   Otherwise speculating on Whats Wrong With Everything is just a narcissistic
289 waste of time.
290  
291   And, Rohrshach, no, you can't put this city out of its misery.  I live
292 here too, and I happen to be fond of pdx...despite its warts and open wounds.
293 I lived on the North side a block from a drug house, and I saw what a block
294 full of neighbors who really give a damn can do to improve life...a group
295 of mild mannered neighbors went up against drug pushers and criminals, and
296 the criminals actually lost.  The drug house went away.
297  
298   Problems will continue.  And we all will die.  But using these as an
299 exuse for perfecting angst is really pretty poor.  
300  
301   And that's my offensive, opinionated opinion.  If you don't care for
302 it, tough.  I, for one, choose not to wallow in the misery.  Not only is
303 there not as much around as people would say, but I will never surrender
304 without a fight.

322  Hi, AD.  I suppose the reason I had trouble with R's musings is that 
323 they are (from my own POV only) amounting to less and less over time.  
324 At first I found them interesting for what they had to offer, but as
325 time went on there was nothing more.  Johnny one-Note.  And then as
326 (I mean when) it was topped off with the line about "putting the city
327 out of its misery", there was this narcissistic self-centeredness about
328 it that just set me off.
329  I'm not trying to be anyone's moralistic guardian of correctness.  AS
330 a matter of fact, if anyone wants to have such a viewpoint, welcome to
331 it.  More power to them.  But if something like that goes to lengths
332 to offend, then I don't have to like that, and I'm bound to say so.
333  At this point, the question would be "Why am I so offended by it?"  
334 I guess it's because the idea of arrogance and snobbery repulse me,
335 and statements such as that are loaded with it.  I heartily resent
336 the attitude that puts any certain individual at the center AND BECAUSE
337 OF IT convinces them that thier pronouncments are Right, to the point
338 that they are qualified to throw out the baby with the bathwater, then
339 trash the tub.  We are, each one, the center off all we know, but it's
340 important to realize that we are not only the center of something, but
341 the center of nothing.  We share this real life world.  An attitude other-
342 wise could be fatal to ones self, at least...and to others, if acted out.
343  But am I saying that just because we are, each one, the center of nothing
344 am I also saying that we are insignifcant?  Not in the least! We are all
345 in the focus of our own lives, which we can decorate and beautify much
346 as we can.  I think that a life spent developing one's gifts is the best 
347 one to spend, and the only real way to return a favor to (choose one
348 congruent with your deitific philosphy, 1=the Universe which contributed to
349 your making, 2=the Creator who so endowed you).  I would spend mine no
350 other way, and perhaps it is my own arrogance, but I think if folx spend
351 time developing themselves to a fullness, then the enlightenment shed by
352 all will go a long way toward cancelling out the darkness so many of us
353 seem to want to dwell on.
354  And above all that, realize that there are dark places in the world and
355 down the street, and realize them for what they are, not more than they are.
356 I wouldn't want to be a person for whom angst is a raison d'etre.  Think
357 of the lesions upon society with the head AS WELL AS the heart.  I thin
358 few people do this.
359  
360  Disclaimer: should people follow what I say or do what I do?  Prob'ly not.
361 What I can say wholeheartedly is that this philosopy of balance and 
362 positiveness works for me and enables me to face my problems for what they

372 Justin, thats fine with me.  (Not that you need my permission of course.)
373  
374 Constant angst does get old in short order.  I have NO love for depression.
375 Its just something that is a part of me a good part of the time.  It got old
376 a long time ago, but still it seems to stay.
377  
378 It did have its upside at one time.  It made me take a very thorough and 
379 critical look at the world around me.  Something a lot of people never do.
380 I feel that some aspects of my personality were greatly enhanced by 
381 that experiance.  Alas, others were severly stunted.  Today, in my middle 
382 20's, I'm just starting to learn some fairly fundamental things about
383 personal interaction.
384  
385 Comeing to grips with the fact that I don't live in a perfect world, and 
386 never will has helped me to deal with the depression, even if it hasn't 
387 made it go away.
388  
389 I really envy people who seldom feel the down side.  Being blissfully ignorent
390 would be a gamble, but the price just might be worth it.  I suspect that these
391 people are the rarest of all.  Perhaps thats for the best.
392  
393 We can not hope top be liked by others, when we don't even like ourselves. 
394 Its a cliche', but that doesn't make it any less true.

403 A while back a couple of friends and I started getting together to jam on
404 weekends.  Didn't really get much done, but it was fun, and I was really
405 learning a lot of neat stuff about the guitar, as well as getting to 
406 bounce ideas off of other people.
407  
408 Now, its starting to grow.  People want to 'join'.  I'm somewhat ambivalent
409 about the whole process.  I've got this thing for not repeating the mistakes
410 that others have made in the past, and I suspect I'm about to do so.  Has 
411 anyone on here gone thru the 'forming a band' game?
412  
413 Some things feel right, and others don't in the process.  I had this goal,
414 and its been fairly well obliterated.  That may be a good thing, since it
415 was my goal, and really had nothing to do with the evolving group.  But 
416 still, I feel as though I've lost something.  
417  
418 Its not like I can go out and find other people to play with.  I don't really
419 know any.  I guess this is the point where I start to meet them.  I've
420 always hated having to go thru the whole process though.  Maybe thats
421 part of my problem.

434 Just cheaking in.  We need some briteness and light around here.  All the 
435 negative karma is getting oppresive.  I could write a story...  I never do
436 seem to finish them alas.  (Whoops, sliping into negative karma again.)
437  
438 Oh well, I guess I'll give it a try anyway.
439  
440 (This is based on a story I wrote here a couple of years ago called the 
441 wizard in the window.)
442  
443 I'd come to think of him as the statue mage.  8 inches tall, and full of far
444 more life and mischief then any being that size has a right to be.
445  
446 Looking back, I realize that my finding him was more than luck.  Call it
447 humourise predestination.  An amusing little lark for an amusing 
448 little being.  And I had the good fortune of being the straight man.
449  
450@It wasn't such a bad job really.  Somebody has to be the balance of any 
451@well thought out 
452 It wasn't a bad job really.  He had his fun, and I got to run.  And you 
453 know what they say about the benifits of excercise.
454  
455 I remember the day he first opened the portal vividly.  I'd just spent the
456 better part of an hour trying to catch my girbles.  The Mini mage had set 
457 them loose, and every time I came close to catching one or the other
458 he'd point his wand, mutter, and the girble would vanish, only to reapear
459 across the room and out of reach.
460  
461 Now, I'm a man with a long temper, but I gotta say that I was about at the 
462 end of mine at that point.  A jokes a joke, but the whole situation had 
463 degenerated into something a bit to close to sadism for my tastes.  So
464 I bowed to the Mini Mage, gave him the finger and procedded to flop
465 down on the couch.  After a moment I picked up the paper and began to 
466 read it.
467  
468 Now, if theres one thing that makes MM mad, its tireing of his jokes before
469 he does.  I'd known him long enough to know how to do a fairly effective
470 snub.  Thi one hd really hit the mark, as I could hear him mumbling under
471 his breath as I read the paper.  Finally he settled down.  The calm before
472 the storm I was soon to realize.
473  
474 "Mark."
475  
476 "Yes?"  I said, not bothering to put down my paper.
477  
478 "There's a hole in your floor."
479  
480 "Don't be redic..."  I'd put the paper down.  There was a hole in my floor.
481 It was about three feet wide, and getting wider as I watched.  In fact,
482 it was in danger of swollowing my coffee table.
483  
484 "I think its hungry..."  MM said, smileing mischeviously.
485  
486 I looked him straight in the eyes.  "And what does it want to eat?"
487  
488 "Whats tall, vertical and stupid?"  He asked.  The hole looked like a very
489 thick fog, and it was about to eat my coffee table.
490  
491 I grabbed onto the table just as it started to teeter.  Paper in one hand,
492 coffee table in the other.  The leg touched the hole, and there was a 
493 blinding flash of light.  "Sh*t"  I mumbled just before passing out.

499  I liked that story, 'Dreamer.  It's coolly absurd.
500  
501  Hope there's more.
502  
503  I once was depressed enough to be put in hospital.  Well, the Navy
504 thought so, anyway.  Also, they exused me from service.  Said it was
505 existant prior to enlistment, even though I'd never though of committing
506 suicide ever before in my life.
507  
508  I work overtime to see the good in things, and due to the laws of 
509 diminishing returns, it overall results in a more realistic view of the
510 universe that I would otherwise assume.  I have been told that I have 
511 a very fair mind.  I do know that there is a lot of sloppy thinking going
512 on in the world, and I am arrogant enough to believe that I am not doing any
513 of it, or at the very least, doing my best not to.
514  
515  I think there is a clear difference between being depressed and morose about
516 life's difficulties and societal ills and realizing them for what they are
517 and perhaps doing something about it.  I'd like to change the universe, but
518 all I can do is keep my own corner of it in order.  I think if everyone
519 did this, living thier lives by doing what's right personally as well as
520 working to change or mitigate what's wrong out there, we'd have less of the
521 plights that we do.

523  Right now, I'm just working on the personal sphere and my own philosophy.
524 Not ready to compete agains Sartre or DesCartes just yet, but maybe in a
525 decade or so, who knows.

530 &*&*&*&*'s
531 Justin, thanks.  Heres another installment.  Wish I still had a copy of the 
532 origional, but I seem to have lost all track of it.  I'm sure its
533 preserved in the archives though.
534  
535 Now, at this point you might be thinkin old MM was a bit of a sadist.  I won't
536 say he didn't have a cruel streak in him.  I'm a realist, and I'd been the 
537 butt end of a enough of his pranks to know that he didn't in the least mind
538 putting other beings at the downside of his wit.  But in his defense, I must
539 say that he could take it as well as he could put it out.
540  
541 It wasn't ofteen that I had an oppurtunity to get the upper hand with him.  He
542 was after not even a foot tall, and endowed with the ability to do all sorts
543 of things that we normal humans go google eyed at.  Especially when they 
544 aren't happening on TV.  But there were times when I got the best of him.
545 One in particular comes to mind.
546  
547 Early on, I'd realized that there were certain limitations to his powers.  
548 For instance, he refused to be seen moveing my anybody but me.  This led
549 to all sorts of fascinating possibilities.  On this particualer occasion,
550 I'd decided on an especially elaborate joke.  It was my birthday.  I won't
551 mention which one, though I will note that I stopped paying close attention
552 after I hit 25.  The drop in my car insurance was impressive, and all I'd
553 had to do was live into my middle 20's.  Of course, a lot of ground would
554 have been lost if I'd had the audacity to actually make a claim, but
555 I digress.
556  
557 I'd long had an interest in tropical fish.  Didn't know anything about them
558 really, just liked to watch them swim around.  Something about the semi
559 contained ecology of the fish bowl just fascinates the heck out of me.
560 So, the day before my big day, I'd went down to the local pet shop and
561 purchased a 75 gallon fish tank, and all the stuff that went with it.
562 Including something that looked a lot like a catfish.  Heck, it probably
563 was.  Anyway, I'd payed the people at the pet store to bring it all out
564 to my place, and set everything up.
565  
566 I smiled to myself when I heard the knock on the door.  MM had been flying 
567 around the liveingroom batting at a fly.  As I got up to answer the door,
568 He flew back to the mantle, and took up his ussual stance and possition.
569  
570 I greeted the people from the pet store, and pointed them to the place 
571 I'd decided to have the tank placed.  They handed me a 200 page book
572 with a title along the lines of 'The 100 most important things to know
573 about tropical fish.'  I sat down and began to read.  The pages blurred
574 and my mind wandered.  I contemplated inquiring as to how much it would
575 cost to have somebody come in and take care of the fish for me.
576  
577 It took quite awhile to get everything setup, but when it was all done, it
578 looked quite impressive.  "Looks great, but you know, there seems to be
579 something missing..."  I said staring at the tank.  Slowly I turned about
580 and looked at the mantle.  I think I saw the MM twitch.  The people from the
581 pet store mumbled to each other as 	I wandered over and picked up the
582 MM.
583  
584 "You know, I think I'd get just the affect I'm looking for if we placed 
585 this statuete in the middle of the tank.  The petstore people looked 
586 doubtfull, but couldn't think of any serious objections.  They did
587 urge me to rinse the MM off before placeing him in the bowl.  I declined
588 I took a length of yarn out of my pocket and tied it around the statuetes
589 upstretched arm.  The pet store people mumbled some more.  Gently 
590 I lowered him into the tank.  He came to rest by a piece of artificial 
591 coral.  Carefully I worked the yarn free and removed it from the tank.
592 I barely supressed a chuckle at the sight of the MM at the bottom of the
593 tank.  I thanked the pet shop people and led them ou.
594  
595 As the door closed, I heard a loud splash from the tank.  A high pitched giggle
596 greeted me when I turned around.
597  
598 "You got me a good one there Mark."  He said.
599  
600 I smiled.  "I've been planing it for days."  
601  
602 "And a fine gag it was.  But did it ever occur to you that I might need to 
603 breath?"
604  
605 "You breath?"  I asked incredulosly.
606  
607 "Now you ask me."  He replied.  He winked and dissapeared.

612 &*&*&*&*'s
613 (More of the story.  Somebody has to fill the disk.)
614  
615 My reasons for telling that story are two fold.  The first I mentioned
616 at the outset.  The second I will now explain.
617  
618 Bright sunlight shineing thru my eyelids awakened me.  I didn't open my eyes
619 immediatly, prefering instead to take stock of what my other senses were
620 telling me.  First, smell.  Strange, there was something missing.  Ah, 
621 that was it!  The air smelled to clean.  Next, hearing.  I could hear
622 the twetering of birds.  I was coming close to a conclusion.  Touch,
623 I felt carefully around with my hands.  Hmm, felt like grass.  About 8
624 inches high.  Taste...  I was hungry.  Time to open the eyes I decided.
625  
626 Now, I had expected to find myself in somesort of forest glade or something.
627 Just goes to show you how easily the senses can be fooled.  The first thing
628 I saw upong opening my eyes was a skylight.  The second was the ceiling
629 that surrounded it.  Further examination showed me that I was in the middle
630 of what af first appeared to be a shopping mall.  People were milling
631 about, going into various shops.  I was lying in the middle of an island
632 of wildlife in the middle of a sea of consumerism.
633  
634 Now, you will note that I said it appeared to be a shopping mall at first 
635 glance.  At second glance, a few discrepencies caught my eye.  First of all,
636 The people were dressed strangly.  Clotheing styles varied from the 
637 medieval, to the futuristic, to the I couldn't figure it out.  Next,
638 were the stores.  The featured names like  "Artllo's splitzer emporium."
639 and "Onieas Fibtok grill".  But the thing that really clued me in was
640 the Dalmation that came walking up to me as I stared wide eyed at this
641 strange place.  "Lost are you."  He said, looking me up and down."
642  
643 Now, most people would have lot it at this point.  But after months of dealing
644 with MM, I'd developed something of a tolerance for the bizare.
645  
646  
647 "Yes, as a matter of fact I am.  You havn't seen a coffee table around here
648 by any chance have you?"  Don't know why I focused on the cofee table.  I
649 said I'd developed a tolerance, that doesn't mean I wasn't a little wacked
650 out by the whole exerience.
651  
652 "Was that yours?  D*mn, looks like I've been remise in my duty.  A gnome
653 picked it up and carried it off just before you awoke."
654  
655 "Oh well, it wasn't important." 
656  
657 "You're not from around here, are you?"
658  
659  
660 "I don't believe so.  This wouldn't be earth would it?  USA, Portland OR 
661 would it?"
662  
663 "Nope."
664  
665 "New York?"  I asked grasping at straws.
666  
667 "Nope, welcome to the land of colective unconciousness."
668  
669 Must be anohter name for washington DC  I thought to myself.

723 you meet other musicians of the same genre as yourself? Just hang out at the

725 bulletin boards at schools and music stores. Usually I would feel intimidated

755 me think that roadill would be more appropriate.  Stop the car, pull out the 
756 stereo and lock the door.  h, the joys of modern living.
757      I noticed tha the grass was dying, I'd have t look at the sprinkler 
758 cotrols again.  They don't even ake the things they didn't used to make te
759 way they used to mak them.  Up the stairs and to the door.Insert key, yea the
760 same old outine.  Flipping the light switch by the door brought my livin room
761 to illumination,and also served to remind me hat it was time to vacume again,
762 bt put it off, as my new purcase was heavy under my arm. Id always thought 
763 the mantle loked a little bare, so after unraping the little mage I filled 
764 th hole.
765  
766   Ater dinner I sat down toread the paper. Death, violence and 
767 advertisments all lept out t me.  Sometimes it just seems better to avoid
768 finding out what the ret of the world is doing.  Afte flipping thru the
769 22 chanes I have the dubious honour of recieving I dcided it was time to do
770 som reading. Somthing light and entertaining I thought.  I lookd at my to
771 be read shlf and spoted a book by Piers Anthony that I had been wnting to 
772 read.  Anothr of his Xanth series.  Alway good fodder for an evenings 
773 enterainment.
774  
775     Sme two hours later I had made y way through most of the book.  It was
776 a familer story, but asusual the execution was super.  I caught a movement out
777 of te corner of my eye.  I lookedover at the fireplace, looked away and then
778 looked back again. The clay mage was dancing, twirling about and osing his
779 crystal ball in te air.  This went on for several minues while I sat there
780 slack jwed.  Then with a final florih he turned to me, smiled and disapered.
781  
782     The next dy I went back to the little shop i the mall.  And there in the
783 window was the clay mage  I wasn't sure if it was the same one unti he 
784 winked at me.
785  
786  
787 Well, that didn't work perfectly, but enough of i made it that it should 
788 be easy to figure out.  Gee, BW can't even keep up with 300 bps.  Sigh.

815 Justin- I think I know of the house you speak of.  Until about a week ago, 
816 I lived in the N, NE area.  I was glad to see the citizens standing up for 
817 their community but I worry about a Early Colonization Salem Mass. coming up if

823 Grizzly: I can only speak about the people I knew of; but based on them
824 and some of the sentiments I seem to be aware of in the city, I wouldn't
825 say your fears are groundless...but I would say them unlikely.  
826   Those of the Salem Village, Massachusetts band of witch-burners were 
827 driven by what I see to be totally different motivations.  The rabble
828 who wanted witches burned were generally driven my information spoon fed
829 to them by charismatic individuals who lusted for thier own sorts of power.
830 The neighborhood watches that I've encountered are usually good, decent folx 
831 who mind thier own knitting and would be glad that others do too, except when
832 others who practice what you and I and soceity at large deem destructive and
833 wrong, not only threatenting thier own safety, but those of the neighbors
834 of whom they are fond.  They're not trying to burn anyone...they're just 
835 watching out for each other and promoting a life lived by the rules and
836 laws of our town, which are acknowledged by most people I know to be good
837 things.
838   The Witch-burners of Salem and thier ilk, no matter what time they
839 lived in, were a totally different breed.  They wanted to take over the 
840 world.  The Neighborhood Watchers I knew of just wanted to live in peace
841 and safety on thier own block, which under normal circumstances, they shouldn't
842 have to fight for.

861 Regarding this neighborhood watch topic: A neighborhood watch is a good idea. 
862 The Key word is "watch." To look out for your neighbors is fine.
863 To step in and help is good too. Where some people go overboard is they confuse
864 the concept of a "watch" and turn it into a militia with armed civilians
865 patrolling the streets ready to blow away ne'er do wells and miscreants at 
866 will. Maybe someday it will come to that, but not now please. Let's give the 
867 cops a chance. Now pro-active neighborhood groups that patrol the area unarmed 
868 are to be applauded. By their presence they are sending a message that they 
869 will not tolerate unlawful behavior in their neighborhood. Their message will 
870 heeded, as all criminal elements operate where they are least likely to be 
871 seen.
872 Then they go somewhere else. Maybe your neighborhood?

928 Maybe I'm just whining.  I do that from time to time.  But it does get 
929 frustrating.  I've been trying to put a little life in to BWMS for 
930 FOUR years now.  I got tired of it a long time ago.  
931  
932 Why do I do it?  BW was the first board I ever logged into.  Also, I'm
933 a sucker for an underdog, and BW qualifies for me in that catagory.
934  
935 The inability to upload is a major pain in the behind.  I understand the
936 philosopy behind it, but that don't mean I agree with it.  I could 
937 i I wanted to figure out how to upload stuff.  But, I'm not really all
938 that excited about doing it.  I get payed decent money at work to be
939 stressed out by programing projects that hold zero interest for me.
940 Messing around with one in my spare time holds no interest for me.
941  
942 I'm being a bit of a wimp I know, but thats the way it is.  Besides, I've
943 donated more then my share of blood to BW.  If any one else gives a damn,
944 its time for them to start contributing.  I'm VERY VERY tired.

959 will work for you if you haven't tried it. As far as this wimp stuff goes, if

963 appreciated by me anyway. Maybe you should get someone else to handle it for
