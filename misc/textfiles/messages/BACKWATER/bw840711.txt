25 Heroes cont':
26    I began to realize what Dr. Pournelle had demonstrated.  A hero is a person with commitment.
27 It isn't enough to stand up and make declarations.  Declarations are cheap and easy.  Here's one:  "I'm for God, apple
28 pie, motherhood, and the flag."  We hear that one every election season.  If it's a particularly rough election, we'll
29 hear, "Also, hot dogs, baseball, fireworks, and the Fourth of July!!"  If it's a issue-oriented election, we'll heatrr,
30 "I'm for lower taxes, higher pay, more jobs, and less crime."  If it's a dirty election, we'll hear, "And my 
31 opponent isn't!!"  Declarations without commitment behind them are lies.  They vandalize the truth.  Ultimately, they
32 devalue the coinage of communication.  We learn to respond with boredom, annoyance, or even antagonism.
33   No, declarations aren't herioc.  It's the results of the commitment that's heroic.  I need to talk about commitment
34 here.  Commitment is the deliberate re-creation of intention, day after day after day, even when you don't feel like
35 it--especially when you don't feel like it, especially when you think that youu're not making a difference or 
36 producing a result.  Commitment is the willingnes to be uncomfortable in order to produce a result.  It works like 
37 this:  You can have your reasons--or you can have your results.  Thant's the choice.
38 People who quit before they produce a result always have good reason.  Haven't you noticed that?  Reasons  are a great
39 way to avouide responsibility.  "I didn't fail.  I mean, not really.  I had a flat tire.  You can't blame me for that.
40 And besides, the sun was in my eyes.  the dog ate my homework.  I've been sick, you know.  We won a moral victory."
41 (When I'm being polite, I respond with "Give me a break...".  You don't want to know what I say when I'm not polite!)
42 People who produce results are willing to give up all those reasons.  All those reasons--those aren't reasons to quit
43 --they're actually just your mind clearly identifying the next problem that needs to be handled.  That's all. 
44 This is it:  Commitment is unreasonable.  And, by extention, so are heroes.  Aren't they?  Think about it.  Think 
45 about the hero of your favorite story.  Just when it looked like he had all the reasons in the world to show why he
46 couldn't succeed, didn't he keep going anyway?
47 Isn't hthat pretty damn unreasonable??  By the way...Villans are also unreasonable.  Often to the point of madness.

98 Well, I've been gone for 3 hours now, and not much has been written, so I think that I'll write part 4 of 'HEROES'.
99 ????????????
100 Heroes cont':  'I mean...would you call Darth Vader a well balanced individual?  Or the average Klingon battle 
101 commander?  Or Ming the Merciless? (You get the idea, don't you??)  But we still haven't answered the question.  We've
102 explored some facts about heroes.  We've found out that heroes are commited and unreasonable.  But so are villans.
103 And again, by that definition, the only difference between a hero and a villan is the point of view of the writer.
104 Obviously, the definition is still insufficient.  There's still something more.
105 The easy answer is to say that tit's a question of good vs. evil.  The hero is good.  The villan is evil.  Except that
106 it's not always apparent which is good and which is evil.  Evil is tricky.  It often masquerades as goodness.(Good 
107 candidate for this is the story of the Fundamentalist minister that uses God as a justification for burning books.)
108 The question reduces to the ultimate theological nightmare.  How do you recognize good and evil for what they really
109 are?  Men of God have been arguing that one for centuries, but it's not a question of how each of us as individuals
110 must also deal with.  And that comes down to each of us being willing to be responsible for ourselves.  Perhaps what
111 is necessary is to rephrase the question.  Try this:  How do we recognize those things that support aliveness?  When
112 you phrase it that way, the question just about answers itself.  Aliveness is the expression of the Self.  We 
113 experience it as joy, enthusiasm, sence of wonder, and uh...commitment. (There's that word again!)
114 What supports aliveness is the creation of a safe place to express it.  And that's what the good guys are all about,
115 isn't it?  Creating places of opportunity and enthusiasm, places to celebrate our humanity and our joy. (For 
116 instance, have you ever realized that some conventions are a celebration of Science Fiction???)
117 By that defintion, it's really easy to see who the heroes of the world are.  A hero is a person who is commited to
118 the quality of life on the the planet:  A world that works for everyone with no one and nothing left out.  A hero 
119 represents the desire of life for perfection--the thrust toward Godliness.  That definition is big enough to include
120 all of us, the whole human species.  The truth is, there isn't a person on the planet who isn't commited.  All that's
121 needed and wanted is the expression of that commitment.  Try this test:  there's a bright red button in front of you.
122 The card beneath it says:  "PUSH THIS BUTTON TO DESTROY THE WORLD IN A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST."  Would you push the button?
123 What is there was a green button next to it:  "PUSH THIS BUTTON TO HAVE THE WORLD BE A PARTY FOR EVERYONE."  Would 
124 you push this button?  Can you imagine ANY responsible human being pushing the red button?  And that brings us to 
125 villans...
126 ?????????????
127 I'll leave off here.  I really would like any/all comments.  If you don't understand something, tell me and I'll try
128 to clear it up.

148 Dear "Doctor", if you are still looking for a hero, you are looking
149 in the wrong place. Heros aren't dedicated, they are successful. It
150 is nothing they want, but what society wants. A hero is called such
151 because he did something that other people wanted badly. It does help,
152 of course to get killed doing it, but this isn't really necessary.
153    As for your buttons, avoid that green one, it could kill all of us.
154 And, yes, I can easily think of reasons for pushing the red one, such
155 as why leave the world to the Russians or the Chinese.
156 
157 One stray question regarding the tobacco ads that claim noone is hurt
158 by others smoking: How many people were killed by fires last year?
159 (The leading cause of fatal fires is smoking.) Or don't they consider
160 the insurance companies' estimate that smokers cost employers over
161 $2,000 harmful to those who have to pay for it? Why ask, though, if
162 they fell the smell of burning s... is so wonderful, they will .....

175 ESSENCE OF WHAT HEROS ACTUALLY ARE, A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE, CONTRAST, OF POINT

200      After Petrov had left, crawling back through his ventilation duct, I just
201 stared at L'homme, at a loss for words.  Finally L'homme verbally echoed the
202 thoughts running through my head, "What do you think about that?  Can we trust
203 him?"  "Beats me.  If what he says is true, he could be quite useful to our
204 side.  But how do we know which side he's really on?"
205 L'homme suggested we call Ian.  He had resources we didn't, and might have some
206 idea of how to proceed.  So while L'homme scattered numerous of the 
207 Network's security gadgets about the suite, I called Ian on the commset.
208 After making sure Ian's end was private, I described what had been happening,
209 and then told him about our dilemma regarding Petrov.  He indicated that he
210 would contact his sources and gather all the information he could about Petrov,
211 but in the meantime we should proceed as if Petrov was trustworthy, but only
212 insofar as it did not threaten our safety or that of the Network.  He then
213 informed me that we had been given 'unlimited credit' with the Network.  We
214 were authorized to requisition any information, equipment, and/or personnel
215 that we felt we might need.  On that encouraging note, we terminated the
216 contact.  Packing up the commset, we left the room; L'homme pausing in the hall,
217 and affixing a hair from door to frame.  He seemed so proud of himself,
218 I couldn't bear to disillusion him.  That gimmick was so old, that was the first
219 thing every halfway-competent spy, detective, and burgler checked for. Well,
220 L'homme didn't have my years in the business.  Hopefully, he'd live long enough
221 to learn.
222      As we rode down the elevator and then headed for the street, L'homme asked
223 about my past, and my experiences with the Network.  I told him that I was not
224 actually a Net agent, but was rather what was euphemistically referred to as
225 an 'independent contractor'.  What this meant was that normally I was just your
226 run-of-the-mill private eye, spending my time on sordid divorce cases and
227 missing person problems.  Occasionally, however, Ian had need of my special
228 abilities, and would call me in to join their elite forces.  The regular
229 Network agents usually scorned me as an outsider, but c'est la vie.
230      Then he got personal.  He claimed professional curiosity, but I could tell
231 that he was a bit worried by my casualness in the face of obvious danger.
232 I somewhat indignantly explained to him that I was a very successful detective, 
233 and there were only four cases I had been unable to solve.  Three involved
234 various arms of the Mckane organization, plus one other.  The failures against
235 McKane were when I was unaided by the Network.  In one, I was hired to find
236 and retrieve several pet gerbils which had mysteriously disappeared.  I tracked
237 them to an earmuff factory run my McKane, but lost the trail there.  Another
238 time I had been hired to get a politician's son back from the Primal Belch cultists,
239 but the 'temple' where he was kept was guarded by Bolo's, and I didn't have the right stickshift.
240 The third time I had been hired by the Mormons to prove that McKane's
241 rent-a-miracle scheme was a fraud, but in that one, I didn't have a prayer.
242 The last time I was unsuccessful was the time I was hired by a group of
243 computer fanatics in Portland to find an elusive computer collector/seller
244 named Aaron.  This guy was amazing...the lengths he would go to keep from being
245 located were phenomenal.  Last I heard, they were still looking.
246      L'homme still seemed to be troubled about my lack of success in my
247 previous encounters with McKane, but I reiterated my belief that with the
248 Network's backing, McKane was as good as dead. (Now all I have to do is
249 convince myself of that!).
250      As we approached an intersection, I said, "I have no doubts about our
251 ability to deal with McKane when we find him.  But in the meantime, do you
252 have any idea of where to go now?"

264   The recent turn of events found me standing on a street corner, several blocks
265 from the Hilton. After dictating my message, I had returned to the hotel, only
266 to find that Joshua and L'homme were gone. I was contemplating my next move when
267 a temptingly delicious-looking cream puff stepped out of a Rolls Royce and
268 MOVED (wow!) towards me.
269   She spoke in a terrible Russlish accent. "The player has a royal fizzbin."
270   I fumbled for the correct response, "uh...um..."
271   She stared at me coldly. "The player has a royal fizzbin!"
272   I got it! "Except on Tuesdays." Contact made. So, she's a McKane agent!
273   Apparently, this agent, called 'Honored Matre', caught me "investigating" her
274 body because she suggested that we move to a motel room "for communication
275 privacy." Naturally, I demanded the right to choose the room--so as to avoid
276 being bugged. Once in the room I turned to her and abruptly demanded that she
277 spread her legs. (aw c'mon you dirty-minded people!). I mean I FRISKED her.
278   My bodily investigation (corpus delectable) lingered longingly at her two
279 well-rounded personalities. (euphemism). "What are you doing?" she demanded. I
280 distractedly responded. "Just checking for booby traps."(sorry).
281   Finally satisfied with the search, I donned my most ominous expression and
282 insisted upon an explanation for McKane's audacity--having ME, one of his most
283 apparently loyal agents, investigated! Honored Matre laughed in my face. "McKane
284 is a pile of-" Pause. "I don't think it matters if you know. I work for a person
285 named Ian." She laughed again. "We know more about Mckane's organization than
286 you think!"
287   I was stunned. Tried to hide it. Honored Matre explained that she was going to
288 discover what my game was. I insisted that I was working against McKane. Still
289 she persisted, "There's a better way to learn these things." A wildly seductive
290 voice! Even her speech was a weapon of excitement. Then she touched me HERE and
291 THERE--a demon was summoned from my soul. Erotic ecstasy welled in me like
292 molten magma longing to erupt madly from it's earthly grave! How did she do this
293 to me?!
294   I stepped back, resisted. "Control through sex is the last refuge of the 
295 incompetent!" I think I lacked conviction. Once again she touched me HERE and
296 THERE!
297   ...So what's wrong with a little incompetence?

344 Circles (words: Gwen Zak Moore, verse 5: Ann Cass; music: "Windmills" by Alan Bell)
345 In days gone by, when the world was much younger,
346 Men wondered at Spring, born of Winter's cold knife.
347 Wondering at the games of the moon and the sunlight
348 They saw there the Lady and Lord of all life.
349 Chorus:Around, and around, and around turns the good earth;
350 All things must change as the seasons go by.
351 We are the children of the Lord and the Lady
352 Whose mysteries we know, yet will never know why.
353 In all lands the people were tied with the good earth
354 Plowing and sowing, as the seasons declared.
355 Waiting to reap of the rich golden harvest,
356 Knowing her laugh in the joys that they shared.
357 CHORUS
358 Through Flanders and Wales and the green lands of Ireland,
359 In kingdoms of England and Scotland and Spain;
360 Circles grew up all along the wild coastlines,
361 And worked for the land, with the sun and the rain.
362 CHORUS
363 Circles for healing and working the weather,
364 Circles for knowing the moon and the sun,
365 Circles for thanking the Lord and the Lady,
366 Circles for dancing the Dance never done.
367 CHORUS
368 And we who reach for the stars in the heavens,
369 Turning our eyes from the meadows and groves
370 Still live in the love of the Lord and the Lady:
371 The greater the circle, the more the love grows.
372 CHORUS

389 "I hope you don't think I am being too personal, but I like to know as much as I can about the people whom with I work.
390  In the past, before I joined the network, I always worked alone. I couldn't really afford to trust anyone in the
391  business I was in."
392 "Which was?", asked joshua.
393 "Well...let me say that a knowledge of mechanics, fast cars, chemical properties of substances, old movies, spy books,
394  computers, political science, french literature, pre-columbian art, and fine wines are all a part of what I used to
395  do. And with the knowledge I have retained, I find this network business fascinating."
396 "Why are you and the network so interested in McKane?", continued joshua, obviously trying to find out as much about
397 me as I had found out about him.
398 "The network doesn't need to explain the reasoning behind every covert action we are involved in. That is why we employ
399 a special lobbiest in Washington. That is why we must utilize the commset. That is why we use an uncrackable code.
400 And that is reason enough to go after McKane, bring him down, and bring him down hard. His past actions were merely
401 the work of a frustrated maniac. His kidnappings, his primal belch fiasco. All of these actions simply further the
402 existance of the McKane organization a little longer. The Network had noticed McKane a few years ago, when he was 
403 involved in some rather delicate operations originating in the mountains of Columbia. We were intrigued, nothing more,
404 nothing less. When he got invloved in international politics, we sat back, and we watched. We sent a couple junior agent
405 s his way, which he dispatched without much trouble. We were indeed impressed with that, but they were only junior
406 agents. But now...now", my voice rose as my contempt rose, "he is fooling with something he has no right sticking his
407 pitiful nose into. The circle of prayer can do something to this country...somthing that I don't think this country
408 can handle at the moment.", my voice trailed off as I began once again to ponder with horror the ruin McKane could
409 cause.
410 Joshua seemed at first surprised at my diatribe, but I guess he was relieved that I was indeed talking. Even if I wasn't
411 answering his questions directly, I was giving him more information that he had had before.
412 "This ruin you speak of", started joshua, carefully choosing his words as he spoke. "Why does it scare the supposedly
413 all powerful network so much?"
414 "McKane may be able to accomplish something that no other organization of evil has been able to accomplish before.
415 Popularity. SPECTRE couldn't get it, KAOS couldn't get it. That's why these organizations have failed. That is why they
416 are no more. McKane has the ability to get the public behind him. He may be able to get the public to sympathize with
417 his cause. Then all who remember what this country is built on...all who remember what freedom really is, all of us
418 who know...we will be in the minority, we will be the enemy, and we will be the ones who are under the gun. I dread that
419 day. And I and the Network will do everything in our power to stop Mr. Leroy McKane. Stop him, and his organization!"
420 Joshua stood there on the sidewalk speechless for a moment, unable to think of anything to say. FInally he regained
421 his usually complete composure, and we continued on down the street.
422 "Ah...Where to know?", asked Joshua, still digesting all that I had told him.
423 "To my car. We will drive to McKane headquarters, and see what we can see. And we will go in my car.
424 "That's fine with me.", replied joshua, as we headed for the parking lot.

503 deathly still.  Only the slight rise and fall of his chest betrayed the fact
504 that life still resided within him.  Suddenly, his entire being convulsed, 
505 catapulting him onto the hard, cold floor.  Sitting up, he scanned the room

507 until a comprehension of where he was came to him.
508    Dressing slowly, the piper splashed cold water into his face, ran a ragged

514 To the person interested in Smalltalk:
515   Addison-Wesley has three books available on the language: one deals with
516 the user interface, one on the language and it's implementation, and one on
517 "Bits and Bytes of History."  The best information of a tutorial nature that
518 I know of is in the August, 1981, issue of Byte magazine.  I am presently 
519 trying to learn the language (still having some trouble with the precise 
520 details of the inheritance mechanism and creation of new classes of objects
521 along with the full power of the system browser and when and why to use 
522 workspaces rather than other specialized windows) but I have made considerabe
523 progress.  The major obstical to learning Smalltalk is the availability of
524 suitable hardware to run it on!  If I can be of help, let me know.

557   "Control through sex is the last refuge of the incompetent."
558   Witness the two most incompetent people in Oklahoma City...
559 ...uh...Due to a sudden relapse of a Puritan sense of morality, the obvious
560 course of Petrov's encounter with Honored Matre will NOT be detailed.(awwwwww!).
561 Of the situation, however, I will say this:
562   Once in bed, Petrov and Honored Matre fought for supremacy(sorry, no details).
563 Petrov discovered very little from Honored Matre.  She did mention that Joshua
564 was pretending to work for McKane so as to gain insight into his organization.
565 Petrov couldn't be certain, though.  During his mind-blanking ecstasy, Petrov
566 was unsure what he was telling Honored Matre about himself.
567   (end of summary. Back to first-person text.)
568   My thoughts were unclear--a baneful predicament for my line of work.  What did
569 I tell her?  I forced myself to concentrate on my present destination.  After
570 leaving the motel (Honored Matre was already gone), I proceeded back to the
571 Hilton.  Perhaps I could find someone who observed L'homme and Joshua leave. I
572 was anxious to track them down.
573   And so I did.  Though L'homme and Joshua were too elusive to be seen by 
574 "common people," I found success by contacting  McKane.  Temporarily working
575 both sides did have its advantages.  One of McKane's men had placed a homing
576 device in L'homme's car.  McKane gave me the frequency needed to track the car
577 with my nifty McKane requisition "Swiss Army Watch."  He also warned me about
578 L'homme and Joshua's resourcefullness--three of McKane's Junior agents had been
579 slaughtered by some very clever booby traps in L'homme's hotel room.
580 (the agents in question were surprised to find a hair strung across the door,
581 the first thing they look for and never expect to find.)
582   In my business, one gets used to excitement.  Living in fear, body parts
583 threatened, piloting space shuttles stolen by the McKane Organization.
584 (The government still hasn't admitted that one!)  The one thing that still
585 reduces me to a blob of jelly is the occasional taxi ride. At the rate we were
586 moving I'm sure we were gaining on L'homme and Joshua.  My watch indicated
587 dead ahead--heading straight for the heart of Oklahoma City's famous china town.
588 Yuck!  Five square miles of raw fish.  My watch led me to a parked
589 car-L'homme's!  There they were, looking for transportation.  Gosh, Joshua
590 spoke fluent Chinese. I found a rickshaw.  Banzai!  Laying the driver out cold
591 and donning his clothes (and my "Team Banzai" headband--I knew that would come
592 in handy someday), I pulled the cart over to the two superspies, hat hiding my face.
593   Joshua and L'homme gratefully climbed aboard.  They were discussing recent
594 events.  Both men seemed to think I should only be trusted SO far--and was
595 probably incompetent anyway.  At that instant I turned to them, "Where to?"
596 They were visibly stunned and momentarily speechless. Finally Joshua found his
597 voice, motioning with a broad gesture, "out there...thataway!"
