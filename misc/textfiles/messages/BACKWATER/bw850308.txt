28 Jack brought in the morning paper and had a seat at the breakfast
29 table, he casualy flipped to the financial page and read the headlines:
30 Skippy stock up 20 points in massive trading... he couldn't take it 
31 anymore, a tear could be seen in his eye.  Marci looking at Jack, knew
32 he would have to suffer alone, they all would.  She was a bit nervous
33 and reached for her purse her mind on the solitary cigarette she saved
34 for just such a moment. As she was scouting through her purse, the lottery
35 ticket she had purchased on the night of the caper caught her eye, pulling
36 it out she looked at the date: hmm last night... "Say Jack, could you 
37 hand me the sports section." Jack mumbled and handed her the entire paper.
38 Tony saw the ticket in Marci's hand and remarked" Say Marci, remember your
39 promise?, he chuckled thinking out the outrageos odds of winning a major
40 prize in the lottery.  Marci ignoring Tony's attitude but nodding in
41 agreement to her promise opened up the paper and found the scoreboard
42 section. "say Tina, You hang on to the ticket and Ill read the numbers
43 maybe we will win twenty bucks or something" Tina looked over and picked
44 herself up from her catatonic state on the couch, Any deversion would
45 be nice. And Marci began to read, 6, 13, 15, 25, 35, 38..."well, how did
46 we do?" She turned and looked at her partner, Tina was white; her hands
47 were shaking and all she said was "we just won 6 million dollars." The
48 devious adventurers had been rewarded. Tony was grinning, Tina fainted,
49 Marci and Jack retrieved the ticket from Tina and shared a kiss. Well,
50 1.5 million apiece, not to shabby for the peanut butter barons.

71 Esteves:   The "Revue" was enjoyable until my blunder. "It takes two guys..."
72            I appologize for having been the second guy in the statement.
73            Such poor timing is unbecoming an Agent, a former one at that!
74 Eugene:    Not to worry, the mysticism may only last as long as your absence.
75            But far be it for me to spoil the endevors of those that have built
76            the secrecy around me! In time the truth shall be known.
77            For the good of the cause.
78 Gaudy:     It was a pleasure to have seen you again, just stop leveling that
79            funny looking hand gun at me, if you would be so kind.
80            And beware of familiar patrons at odd hours. Maybe.
81 Fellows:   Not even you can stop the likes of me! I fear not the one that takes

91     Tkathyd? anyone?  what (and where, and why) is an "open mike?"  My only
92 aquaintance with such an object occured when I used to flip a switch on an
93 audio board and bring up the gain on that channel.  Somehow that doesn't
94 seem to fit the context...
95 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
96    The piper rose from his seat at a table deep in the shadows.  The night's
97 activity had subsided somewhat; the almost frantic activity of the inn's
98 patrons had subsided.  Draining the dregs of the ale from his mug, he slipped
99 outside the scarred wooden door, letting it drop back into place behind him.
100   It was as if a knife had cut across the skein of warmth and laughter, 
101 chopping off the warm yellow glow from the inn.  Outside, the full moon
102 had painted the world with a colorless brush, tinging the grasses that gave 
103 with a soft crunch beneath his step with a blue-white frosty glare.
104    Turning the corner of the heavily-built building, even the atmosphere
105 seemed to change.  The quiet seemed to deepen, and the cool air took on a
106 tang that told of distant icy ridges and snowey pines laden beneath their
107 winter burden.  Hurrying quickly under the icy gaze of the stars, the
108 piper creaked open the wooden door and walked into the warmth and animal
109 odors of the stable.  Standing for a moment to let his eyes adjust to the
110 lack of the moonlight, the piper fumbled in his sporran and pulled out a
111 strangely contrived tinderbox.  Working by touch, he pulled back the nut
112 that held a small piece of worked flint and let the chase down over a
113 small fluffy piece of tinder.  Releasing the nut, the flint was driven
114 over to the chase -- its file-like surface drawing a shower of sparks
115 over the just exposed tinder.  A few sparks caught within the tinder and a
116 cautious breath nursed a tiny flame into life.  A wooden splint trasfered
117 the infant flame to the nursery of a candle wick where it thrived and grew
118 to pierce the darkness with its precocious brilliance.

139 Piper - A "Open Mike" is an arrangement that a couple of local comedy clubs to
140         allow amatures a chance to get in front of a audience and be heckled to
141         death, Kathyd is just looking for some moral support.  One Main Place
142         has this every tuesday night.  It is something I have wanted to do ever
143         since I listened to Bill Cosby as a kid.  My problem is that most of my
144         humor is reactive in nature, I need someone to act as a catalyst, but I
145         don't think I could work with anyone else.  Maybe that's why I bartend,
146         there's lots of people to bounce off of, and I have something to keep 
147         my hands busy with between wise-cracks.  I'll tell you thought, it 
148         doesn't hurt my tip.
149 Kathyd - Didn't mean to answer a question that was asked of you, but I needed
150         to writs SOMETHING this morning, and the creative juices weren't flow-
151         ing last night.

299 Leonard - Is this also known as the "survival game"?  As I remember T.A.G. is
300 something completely different, but then I can only hope.
301 I want to thank everyone who dropped by Weeks End to see me.  I did engoy it.
302 If any of you happen to be out that way on Saturday night, say hi.
303 I wanted to enter a poem tonight, but as I am forced to type in total darkness,
304 and I am not a touch-typist, this is too slow for that.  Besides, I'm not real
305 happy with the last verse.  Or the first for that matter.  Some of the ones
306 in between are ok though.
307 
308 Kathyd - I envy you being able to sit down and write something like you did.  I
309 once read a story written by Asimov that he had done on a British talk show.  
310 It seems they had challenged his claim that he could write anywhere.  I hope to
311 learn to do that some day.  Mood should have nothing to do with it.

313 TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
314 The sky and snow bounced the sunlight back and forth between them until the
315 air was cleansed of all that was not light. The sun washed them so cheer-
316 fully that it was hard to think ill of the men with weapons or to regard as
317 sinister the smoldering heap of metal which had melted itself a grave in 
318 the snow and was being covered rapidly with sprkling water.
319   In black ski gear cryptically marked with blue, with mirrrored sunglasses
320 and a snug knitted hood, Fleming looked every inch the crack secret agent.
321 But then, he had always mistaken the trappings of heroism for its goal. He
322 believed that if he executed the postures, costumes, and rules of the NET
323 that he would carry out its mission.. He was like a devout churchgoer who
324 fails to grasp the concept of Christian love or a knight who mistakes his
325 armor for the holy grail. He had great will and nerve but lacked insight,
326 a trait which had caused him recently to deploy an expensive bevy of tanks
327 to a remote Ugandan village whose weapons consisted of pointed sticks and
328 to conduct a prolonged stakeout of a bewildered Finnish farmer in Astoria.
329 There were other incidents including his abandonmentof Kosta which had
330 kept him in a low rank in NET and I knew that this ploy to discredit me was
331 a bid for promotion.
332 "Gee," I ventured, "it's a shame to spend such a gorgeous day inside."
333 "We're trying to concentrate, Gaudy," said L'homme grimly as he searched 
334 for the elusive escape route. When things get tense he loses all sense of
335 civility and humor. He is L'homme sans parody.
336 I glanced at Kosta. He looked tired, trapped, but calm. For all his desper-
337 ation and confusion he was a more salvagable agent than Fleming. He had 
338 gone underground in Bulgaria precisely because he had seen beyond the ass-
339 ignment to the inner problem, and now he was trying to connect with NET 
340 again because he wanted in some crazy way to correct its dogmatic excesses.
341 "We're going out, Kosta. We're going to surrender."
342 "WHAT?? No, I've held out too long for that. You guys can surrender. I'm
343       staying here."
344 "The others can't surrender because they aren't wanted for anything. Their
345 presence will be interpreted as an attack. But you and I will be safe
346 because NET rules require agents to accept surrender without impunity"
347 "What makes you think the Hitler Youth out there are going to go by the
348          RULES?" asked Farley.
349 "Nice try Gaudy," said L'homme, "but if he brings you in and Ian hears your
350 side of the story, Fleming will be even deeper in the doghouse. He'd be 
351 better off shooting you."
352 "I know Fleming," said Kosta quietly, "He's incapable of thinking for him-
353 self. OK. Let's do it."
354 
355 It truly was a fine day outside. At the sight of Kosta and our makeshift
356 white flag, Fleming froze. He desperately wanted us dead and we had done 
357 the one thing that would prevent him from killing us.
358 "CCute," he spat, "Clever. So now I take you to Ian."
359 He suddenly gave us an ugly grin. "But you'd better not try anything.
360 Even," he smiled slyly, "if provoked."
361 The remains of the Fiat were now trapped in ice and looked like a big
362 glass paperweight. I had been meaning to get it a tune-up. I felt as if
363 an old friend had died before I had a chance to say something impor-
364 tant. Fleming's devotion to the rules had saved us. It was touching that
365 he was so loyal to the manual but when I see him dead I will feel more
366 for the Fiat than I feel for Fleming.

369 Gaudy:  (Applause) Very well stated.  The time you spend is well worth the
370         wait.  Nothing personal, but it shot the h--- out of the entry I have
371         at my fingertips.  I estimate that I should have to give it a major
372         rewrite, nothing much...

374 Esteves:  This latest entry brings forth the need to attach an ERRATA SHEET
375         to the most recent of guidelines, namely the one discussed with
376         Eugene.   Did I detect a bit of humorous conciet on your instructors
377         choice?   Shame remains for the "second guy".    And another item,
378         H.A.R.M. will return it many shapes and sizes.  "Cranking 'em out"
379         tisn't as harsh an attitude as I had expected, actually somewhat
380         enjoyable now that I consider it a "challenge".  (ring-ring-ring)

385 Well, it's finished.  28 of L'hommes PC Archive disks fit on 13 1/3 of
386 my Tandy disks.  (do you feel those emanations, L'homme?  I believe the technical
387 term for them is "gloat").  So, it took me one hour of preparatory paperwork, 
388 1/2 hour of disk formatting, and 4 hours of 1 (or sometimes 2 or 3 if you had
389 them filed correctly) file at a time.  I had about a dozen read errors, but
390 all but two I managed to tire out (retry..retry..retry..) usually somewhere between
391 5 and 20 attempts.  Oh, and the elusive 05Dec82, 22Dec82 and 20May83 finally showed up. (In 1984?)
392 So, I seem to be complete up to 16Jan85.  I don't suppose there is a list of what
393 there is SUPPOSED to be, floating around somewhere?  All this xferring can lose
394 a file here and there.
395 	And now for bed.

405   I'd even make myself more available for getting shot at if I knew a game

434 Voyeur: The reason those three missing files didn't show up until 1984 is the same mistake made by
435 others, didn't reserve space on the proper disks. Glad to see you got everything finished, at 3:40
436 am? Arg! 2.67 more disks will be delivered to you today. (that's down from four received at P.C.S.)
437 Sorry my files are so scrambled up. What I am planning on doing is using a 20meg hard disk to sort 
438 them. I simply copy all the files to the hard disk, run Norton's DIRSORT utilityon the files, and 
439 then using a .BAT program that has error checking for disk full messages, copy as many complete 
440 files as possible to floppy disks. All I would have to do is change the floppies, the rest would
441 be automated. It sounds like you have done the same thing, but with a bit more work. Only 13.3 disks,
442 that IS disgusting!

465      No one could have noticed, so well she blended with the hearth-
466 blackened walls, for she was still as the flagstones that warmed her,
467 except her ears, sensitive as flickering sails, when they honed in on
468 the piper.  His step, though it drew little attention, held a quiet
469 purpose that interested her; when the great oaken door yielded to his
470 hand, a swatch of night beckoned, with a glimpse of the luminescent
471 amber orb; her eyes filled with a black echo of its shape.  'Twas so
472 compelling that in an instant she was moving like liquid silver in
473 his wake, admiring the rapt appreciation he, too, held for the eve...
474      But when flame chuckled forth from his hands in the stable:  
475 no feline form greeted his eyes!  Rather, two pairs of great wings
476 quivered side by side, one pair akin to a tapestry of silk, softly
477 a-glitter from reflection of the spark in his hand, and the other
478 a wondrous plethora of feathers, scented with star-kissed winds 
479 and far-away sun-lit meadows...Pegasus whickered an affectionate
480 welcome to the piper and shivered those magnificent plumes, seeming
481 afloat by virtue of their gentle, lilting drifting...But the dragon
482 made no sound, nor wafted any fragrance to betray her presence.  
483 Nor did she need to, for her supple skin radiated colour as if in
484 sparks, a fine-cut crystal awakened by light, a milky cluster of 
485 stars smoothed onto her undulating body.  Yet along with this 
486 poise, the piper could sense her hesitance, even as she extended
487 her sleek head towards him in greeting...

517 In the first four years of Reagan's "Get big government off the backs of
518 the people" administration, the number of full-time permanent government 
519 federal employees grew by 23,000.  Jimmy Carter REDUCED the federal roster
520 by 38,000.   It's not what you do, but how you say it that counts!   
521 (From the March 1985 issue of Reason Magazine Page 12)   Very interesting 
522 information if valid. In the same issue (Pg 8) they indicate that the 
523 average American is paying $534 of his tax dollars to defend Europe, while 
524 $322 went to defend the U.S. This is compared to the $360 that the average 
525 German pays and $450 that the average Briton pays total. Oh yes, an 
526 additional $74 of your taxes goes to defend Japan and South Korea. So it 
527 would seem that the average American spends more defending Europe then the 
528 average European. Again, very interesting information if true.

530 Leonard: I finally found that info on the Pied Piper if you're still 
531 interested. The local (?) distributor was Northwest Sales and Marketing, 
532 Inc., 540 South Holden, Seattle, Washington 98108  (206) 763-xxxx. The 
533 local dealer (?) was Shier Sand Portable Computer, 6206 NE Broadway, 
534 Portland, OR 97213, 287-xxxx. The beast was made by STM Electronics Corp., 
535 525 Middlefield Rd.,Suite 130, Menlo Park, CA 94025, (415) 326-xxxx. 
536 Given the state of the industry, I wouldn't be surprised if all of the 
537 above no longer exist. But you can try. I have 3 pages of dealers and 
538 distributors for the beast if you're interested. Some of the distributors 
539 still exist I know because we deal with them at U.S. Digital. They
540 include Microamerica, Bill Kist & Assoc., Excel Dist., and Kaltronics Dist. 
541 In Seattle the dealers were Compu-lab, and Byte Shop. Hope this helps.

572 Altogether an ineresting experience.  Pizza and Flick.  You may notice that
573 there is a lack of a boarder, tis as I intended it to be.  The reason being
574 that I was "beside myself" as to just who I was during the ocassion.
