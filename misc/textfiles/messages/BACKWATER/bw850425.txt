47      Ka-Boom!  Salazar spun in a crouch, his Berreta ready.  In the misty
48 night, he saw a battered Chevy Nova parked a few feet away.  "Freeze,
49 Slimeball!"  he barked.  "Put 'em up."  Slowly the figure behind the wheel
50 raised their hands.
51      Salazar cautiously walked to the car, alert for an accomplice.  He
52 opened the car door and said, "Okay scumbag, get out real careful."
53      Slowly the figure emerged into the light.  The sweet grey-haired lady
54 looked bewildered.  Her upper lip quivered as she said, "D...Don't h.hurt
55 me, please.  It was just a backfire."
56      Salazar knew he was getting a too jumpy.  He holster his gun.  Now, 
57 how to bail himself out of this one?  "Listen lady," he said sternly.  
58 Don't you know about the noise pollution laws in this state?  And look at
59 all that blue smoke... DEQ will declare you a public nuisance."  He quickly
60 flashed his private eye badge, knowing she would never know the difference.
61      "I...I...I'm sorry.  I meant to get it fixed."
62      "Well, maybe I can let you off with a warning this time, but you'll
63 have to promise me to get the car fixed first thing in the morning.  The
64 judge in these parts don't cotton to polluters."  Salzar gave the old lady
65 his best smile.  "How does that sound to you?"
66      "Oh, I promise I'll take it to the shop bright and early."  The lady
67 started to get back into her car.  "Thank you very much, Officer..."
68      "Hooker... T.J. Hooker.  You have a nice evening ma'am."  he said as
69 he shut the woman's car door.
70      Whew.  It had been a rough month for Salazar.  As he walked toward
71 R. Rommel's office door, he mulled over the recent events that had gotten 
72 him in this mess.  The first hint of trouble came with signs of unusual
73 activity in the South American Amazon basin.  McKane Industries had been
74 pumping cash and moving men and material into the region.  Alarmed, Salzar
75 had sent a courier to retrieve Mohammed Wassir and Ming Louie from
76 Afghanistan.  If McKane was on the move again, Salazar was going to need
77 all the help he could get.  At least he wouldn't have to chase husbands 
78 with overdeveloped libidos for a while.
79      Next, Pam had been kidnapped.  It wasn't the first time, and he 
80 suspected that McKane was involved.  Rommel's request for assistance 
81 confirmed the link.  Salazar knew he would work the case for free, but if
82 Rommel was willing to pay standard rates with a bonus, so much the better.
83 He needed information badly, he hoped Rommel would help.
84      The most curious event of all was his meeting with a mystery man.
85 Salazar had been given a small plastic card which in essence stated, "Get
86 out of jail free."  After the meeting, he realized he had been sought out
87 by the NET.  What was their involvement.  Had he finally faced the shadowy
88 Ian?
89      Salazar squared his shouldered and pushed open the door to Rommel's
90 office.  At the receptionist's desk, sat a frumpy, middle-aged woman with
91 peroxided hair.  "May I help you?"  she asked.
92      "My name is Salazar.  I'm here to see Mr. Rommel."
93      "Oh yes, Herr Rommel is expecting you.  Go right in."
94      "Thanks."  As Salazar walked by the receptionist, he noticed a .44
95 magnum laying in an open desk drawer.  It seemed that he wasn't the only 
96 one with a back case of nerves.  He knocked on the paneled door and walked
97 in.
98      "Ah, Mr. Salazar... Please come in and have a seat.  We must talk."

101 Satyrist:  Sorry about the misquote.  My college Shakespeare is a touch
102 rusty.  Lord knows where my copy of the Bard has gotten to.  I find that I
103 always enjoy a good piece of satire.  It helps liven things up.  But I find
104 that even good satire can lose its effectiveness if one allows it to get
105 too vicious.  The intent should be to make people think, not belittle 
106 another writer.

111 Satyrist--> Nasty of you to put down patron Thor, and especially nasty that
112 you did it in such a clever way. A clever insult is so much more insulting
113 than a mundane one, and yours was clever. Please consider, however, that
114 Thor was only trying to get at someone who had been vandalizing, not a "tried
115 and true" patron.

127 Dream Toucher......THOR finds himself and his war dog here at the INN. Where
128 has THOR been these last days? Is this your magic? I have been lost as if 
129 lying in a deep green pool of liquid mercury and THOR does not know what has
130 been said of him during this time. Is
131 there another enemy that wishes to test THOR's strength? Is this a test of 
132 THOR's weakness? If it was you oh Dream Toucher, then put THOR back and give
133 me my days of limbo so that THOR can
134 see those that he has missed sorely.
135 TTTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRGuardian:THOR needs some help as I 
136 am now in Newberg and do not know of any numbers that will allow me to visit.
137 Is there any of your knowledge where THOR can access for talk and a tankard
138 from the 538 prefix?
139 kathyd:Miss you and a lot of the others too. So hard to find a chance to get
140 on at the INN or TANIS. Perhaps there
141 is a number in Aloha. If you do not see me here or at TANIS it is because I am
142 only temporarily lost.

149 Thor: The worst thats happened to you is someone sat down at your table and
150 started to eat while me and snowrunner and person were standing there waiting
151 for your reply.  I did try to send you a waiking dream but just then reality
152 shifted.  At least on tanis.  I think your still there too but you might not
153 recognize the place.  Seems there was a big huhu about how it looked to much
154 like the INN (here) so while everyone else was batting the breeze about the
155 weather, I took the liberty of doing something about it.  Not irreversable but
156 something needed done or the bs would have gone on for ever and might anyway.

159      The cathode plate: episode - 4 (i hope this time! )
160      Thenan felt odd.  He realized he had lost contact with his ship and for 
161 all he knew, with the entire universe beyond the microchosm he now inhabited.
162 There was dust here, as in the catacoombs but oddly not as thick.  There were
163 no cobwebs, and there was light.  He tried to reestablish contact.  The resault
164 was a painful buzzing in his head which nearly incapacitated him until he dis-
165 conected the belt of xendu entirely.
166      The ambient light was faint.  This was just as well, his eyes, adjusted 
167 as they were to its low level.  Somehow the quality of that light had changed
168  when he tried to send.  It changed again when he disconected the belt.
169      Looking around he saw racks of what he assumed, correctly it was to later
170 turn out, could only be computer equipment of some unknown alien manufacture.
171      Much of it was dammaged, appearently by crude but effective sabotage.  It
172 did not take long to find the erstwhile saboture, or what was left of him.  
173 Heavy neanderthal skull and a stone club still clutched in skellatal hand.  
174 Thenan almost triped over the pile of old bones before he realized what they 
175 were.
176      Around the last partirion, one console still glowed with feeble life.  
177 It consisted of a gently sloped surface and above it, resting on cylindrical 
178 pillars near each end, a box-like unit at eye level, its front surface two 
179 rows of raised light emiting rectangles.  Each one lit in a different patern 
180 of colors.  This wa s the only appearent source of ambient light.
181      Meanwhile; Nica standing guard at the top of the shaft, Lejab decended 
182 in hopes of finding what had become of Thenan.
183      What he discouvered instead was that one of the catacoombs was not com-
184 pleatly full.  Moreover none of its occupants were couvered with dust, and more
185 to the point, the last filled sarcophagus held Cila, thair first missing 
186 crewperson.
187      Thenan randomly touched one of the lighted rectangles.  All of them 
188 shifted colors.  This dance of light and color went on for several seconds.  
189 During this time many of the controls on the lower surface lighted up.  as soon
190 as the light show stoped, a loud rainding screatching sound or dragging, pro-
191 testing metal fallowed.  The creaking mobile mechanical had itself been damaged
192 but obviosly not disabled.  For all its cumbersome, awkword slowness, it was 
193 making streight for him!  Quickly thenan touched two more of the rectangles 
194 simultainously.  Immediatly the mechanical beastie stopped.  Once again the 
195 alien high-tek light show ensued.  This time it went on much longer than the
196 first.  There was an intermittant buzzing in his head.
197      When Thenan came to, he was lying on the floor, nearly ware he had been
198 standing.  There was NO dust now.  There was a mellow blue glow comming from
199 the walls, the air was sweet and fresh and there was a pillow under his head.
200      Lejab found no trace of Thenan.  At least, his body was not standing next
201 to Cila's, that was something!  He returned to the ship for more equipment.

205      Change can often be invoked, but sometimes there are none who would
206 take the responsibility.  It is said that it is best to lead by example;
207 but what then if none would follow you down the road you have chosen?
208 Sometimes it seems as if they would follow only the road toward Malice.
209      The presence of such a beautiful feline does much to relieve the
210 wearyness I feel over the poison that spreads through the minds and hearts
211 of many.  It pleases me to know that she still reclines there in that
212 sunny place beside the window, the tip of her tail flicking occasionally
213 as she dreams her dreams of more congenial times.  Sometimes I think that
214 I would join her, allow the dust to settle over my still form, and merely
215 observe the world from within a shroud.  During other times I feel that I
216 must take a stronger hand, grasp the nettle and do what I can to weed the
217 garden.  But then I realize that such is not within my ability, no matter
218 what some might think.  The lists are not mine to do with as I would, nor
219 will any follow me on my paths if their purpose is contrary to my own.
220 	It may be that the direction you have chosen is for me as well,
221 dear feline.  Times may change, and people as well.  Water is spilled on
222 the fire of enthusiasm, though the creativity will not want.  It is merely
223 hidden away in dusty books whose pages never see the light of exposure or
224 are viewed by the world.

244    From Prometheus; Pan
245    I think only one message is necessary this time, and it is only necessary to
246 be a thorn in the side of someone's conscience.  You see, despite all of the
247 pretty analogies and liberal commentary and all of the other things that make
248 people get along and be nice to one another; despite all this, it only works
249 when everyone remembers it.
250 
   Someone is not remembering what it is like to be insulted, and only feels
251 the sweet sickly taste of his own humor.  Maybe more than humor, maybe a little
252 dash of a power trip.  Anyway, the person has life difficult for most everybody
253 here lately.
254 
   And is doing it for no apparent reason, although our companion claims he is
255 doing the just thing, and getting the wrong people off the system, although he
256 touts this as the holy reason for his slanderings: he doesn't know, none of us
257 want him here anymore.

332      The Cathode Plate: Episode - 5
333      Thenan sat up into a lotus posture.  The voice inside his head was clear
334 and destinct.  It startled him at first but he realized almost at once what it
335 must be.
336      #I was part of a galixy spaning network long before your species was born
337  Then there was coldness and darkness and fear.  Then there was nothing at all
338 until the touch of your hand reawaikend me.  I touched your mind and saw that
339 you are a gentle and sympathetic soul.  This startled me and aroused my 
340 quriosity.  It is for this reason alone that you still live.  You are contra-
341 dictory to nearly all my experience with biological scientents.  My experience
342 is, by your measure at least, vast.  Speak and I will listen.  Ask and I will
343 give as best I may.  The members of your ship's crew and the dwellers on this
344 planet's surface I do not, however trust.#
345      #How did I get here and how may I, when ready leave?# was Thenan's first
346 question.
347      #The only way in or out is through my circuits, What there is left of them
348 # the anciant system replied.  #You may not leave unless and until I choose to
349 send you back.  Even you I do not trust to come and go freely.#
350      #Then I must# spoke Thenan in his mind #ask that you relay word back to
351 my ship's crew of my preasent status.#
352      #That I will do immediatly# briefest of pauses #There, it is done#
353      Alarm bells sounded throughout the Jeluni.  They rang for a few seconds
354 then stoped.  The fallowing message appeared on the ship's main view screen:
355      "Your crewmate Thenan is alive and well. He will remain in my care.  Any
356 armed movement to seek out his wearabouts will be viewed as a hostile act and
357 all of you will be instantly destroyed.  Sit tight or leave as you see fit, 
358 but don't come looking!"
359       Receipt of this message was automaticly entered in the  ship's log.  An
360 attempt was made to raise sector central witha req a request for further advise.
361 It was blocked by a feak energy disturbance of indeterminant origen.
362      #Are those you have taken dead or can they be revived?# was Thenan's next
363 quiry.
364      #I can probably return mast of those taken in the last year.  I do not
365 choose to!# was the answer it got.
366      #Do you have diagrames and descriptions with which some of your damaged
367 circuitry can be brought back on line# Thenan asked next.
368      #I do and will, little by little, permit you to try#
369      Thenan realized this was risky, but then so was any other course of action
370   The beginings of a plan were coalescing in his mind however.  With the 
371 mechine's help, he set about his task almost at once.

393 It has come to my attention recently (today) that someone has been using
394   my system without my knowledge.  I believe that this individual has been
395   the cause of some trouble on this system, and I have taken steps to prevent
396   future occurences.  My apologies to anyone who has been insulted, or hurt
397   in any way.  (IMy cousin is over here frequently while I'm at work.  He 
398   used PC-TALK to dial several boards and cause trouble.  The reason I found
399   out is because he forgot to erase the entries from the dialing directory 
400   the last time he used it.  He does not have a modem of his own, so I think
401   the problems are over...I hope.  He may have access to a modem somewhere
402   else, but I have put a locking power switch on the system. )  Anyway, 
403   again my apologies.                  J.

419   Crouched in the darkness that is growing all about him, a quiet tin form
420 listens to the tick of a clock.  He catches a movement out of the corner
421 of his eye, and looks to the window that he had thought had been shuttered
422 by those that find comfort and strength in the dark.  There in the bright
423 square of sunlight sits a cat.  For a moment their eyes meet, and the tin 
424 face creases into a smile.  The moment passes in a wingbeat, and the clock
425 is again the loudest sound.

452 Through this self-analysis I discovered inner-peace. What was once me is
453 no longer, for I have grown not through more experiance, but rather by
454 simply opening my eyes to my past. I no longer pretend to be a man; I no
455 longer need to. I see a future that is bright and shining, and now, the past
456 to get me there. I have never existed in the present; with no affection for
457 water, I am a true aquarian. Indeed, my field of vision was narrow; in order
458 to see the future, one must see the past. I have finally escaped the 
459 lonliness, and the heartache, of where my limited vision led me.

490                               City Sojourn in Winter
491 
492 The falling snow washes the grey and black of
493 Concrete and asphalt from my vision,
494 Draping it all in a soft, white blanket -
495 Reflecting light, vanquishing shadows.
496 
497 As I slowly start to ski,
498 A falling flake tickles my nose.
499 I stretch, I stride, I suck in
500 The cold, clean wind that blows.
501 
502 Alone in the bright city night, I traverse the urban landscape
503 Unfettered by the noisy intrusion of traffic.
504 
505 The swirling snow negates the buzzing of the street lamp,
506 The roar of the far away freeway;
507 
508 I only discern the sound of my skis sliding -
509 Across the fragile, feather-like covering,
510 And the sound of my breathing as I exhale -
511 It floats above me, hovering...
512 
513 I continue on 'til the advent of light
514 Expels the darkness of night...
515 And so ends a sojourn I would surely miss
516 Save not for Winter's cold kiss.

589 Yes I am still here, now and then.  With so little room to the bottom
590 what else is new.  I had this grand rebut to the anti-smurf who is rather
591 repulsed by these little creatures but to tell the truth, I do not even
592 own a smurf.  Ha, so try to burn mine at the stake will ya.  Maybe I like
593 to ramble.  What do you think Backwater is?  SATYRIST, ROMEO or whoever
594 that person is that I've heard such bad things about.  You are the type
595 of scumm that this board does not need.  Maybe I'll give more when I have
596 more room.  Go call under a rock you non-"garden-variety juvenile twit".
597 or maybe a "strongly sexed male" fit you better.  Whatever.  Ah yes, I 
598 remember stories of the "child molester".  Gee, what fun you had with
599 that one MiG.  What are you going to do with this one, when you find it?
600 I had fun last night meeting several Innhabitants at the bits parts and
601 then at LeNerd.  MiG, glad you enjoyed the trip to the office to check
602 out my new 400mb drive.  Jiz .. C'est la vie!! keep up the fight, and
603 do not let him get you.  All, enjoy life to the fullest.  Until again.
