21      It is difficult to explain with precision what has transpired during
22 the last twelve odd months.  Time has relatively stood still for the young
23 Master West and his guardian in some bizzare region just outside the land
24 known as Inisfal.  Recognized aquaintances have departed and unknown
25 others have taken their places at the gathering places, and several passed
26 through with little recognition -- or deservance.  Time for these two would
27 slowly return to normal after having slipped for so long and the changes
28 would be outstanding...  Lord only knows they could use the warmth provided
29 by the fire kindled by Innkeeper.

34      The snow fell bleakly in the silent town, white sheets of fluff that 
35 grew to become a Nebraskan winter.  Becky Tomlin stood watching the sight.
36 It was the first snow to fall this year, and it would not be the last.  
37      Becky was a special girl in that she was retarded.  All of her life 
38 she never said a word, and yet always had the bright gleam of knowledge in
39 her eye.  She was a reader of thoughts, a telepath if you will.  She knew it
40 would be bad if civilization found out her abilities.
41      Becky walked home, watching the way her feet made prints in the snow,
42 laughing and enjoying herself.  She arrived at her home, a small rural place
43 on a farm.  She lived with the animals, and interacted with society only
44 when she had to.  The feed was getting short though, and if the snow kept
45 up, she would be caught without feed, and the animals would starve...
46      She hopped in the beat-up station wagon, turning over the engine after
47 four tries, and headed out into the snow.  The roads were clogged with 
48 traffic, making the trip slow.  She arrived into town at about 4:30.  She 
49 thought she had best get home before dark, in case the snow fell hard.  
50 Chicken feed was up in price, but the trip was uneventful, except for a 
51 strange, drawing feeling, and voices in the back of her mind.  It was like
52 when she used her talent, but she wasn't using it.  Maybe it was best she 
53 stayed in isolation.
54      On the way into the country, the feeling grew stronger as the buzzing
55 in her head grew, filling her with it's distraction.  She was on the main 
56 road out, when she lost singular concious thought.  She/him were driving to 
57 (or from?) town when a beat-up station wagon hit them, straight on.  The 
58 impact killed both drivers instantly, neither knowing the other was a 
59 telepath...
60  
61   Moral:  Keep your thoughts to yourself...

73    "Now hold still Parity. This won't hurt a bit. Your friend has lost a lot
74 of blood. How fortunate you two have the same blood type." Dr. Buchan swabbed
75 the area on Parity's arm, and his wife injected the needle. 'Give Blood' Parity
76 thought to himself. The needle pricked, but he did not visibly react. He
77 clenched his fist as he had been instructed in a class at Nirvana. The red line
78 of life traced up the tube into a small bag. The more he clenched, the more
79 the bag filled. 'Fellows needs this' he thought, 'Fellows needs this.'
80    Buchan and his wife went back to work on Fellows, leaving Parity in the
81 other room. It was a room like any other room one might find in an old
82 Western house. Filled with mementoes from a successful practice in Las Vegas,
83 the walls and shelves contain a history of two people who had gone from
84 humble beginnings, to relative easy living, and returned back to their roots
85 in the desert two hours beyond the glitter and villainy of the gambling
86 capital of the world.
87    Parity's mind drifted has his sight blurred. 'Lost a lot of blood. How
88 fortunate. How fortunate. How...'
89    Parity was elsewhere. In a room, seated in a highback vinyl chair. Several
90 aged men sat in similar chairs evenly spaced around him in a semi-circle. He
91 looked from face to face, searching out some explanation of why he had been
92 brought here. In the lined, character-filled faces he could find no answer.
93 One of the faces spoke.
94    "Explain to us N E T. NET. What does it stand for. Why do you stand with it?"
95    Parity at first didn't understand. 'Why would they ask me questions about
96 NET? My mission is... I can't remember...' "NET? It isn't an acronym. Well, it
97 is and it isn't. It's..."
98    "Irrelevant. What does it *stand* for. Listen. We ask, why NET?" The second
99 voice looked more stern than the first.
100    Parity swallowed hard. "NET, it's a philosophy come to fruition. Our world
101 is rampant crime. Crime becomes organized. Government can't do an adequate job
102 of protection. There are too many restrictions on enforcement organizations.
103 Corporations need help. Governments need help. People need help. There exists
104 organized crime. We are organized law."
105    The third face. "So you set up a para-military organization, call yourselves
106 Gods, and run unrestrained in the streets. NET makes their own rules and plays
107 their own games. How can you defend this attitude.?"
108    Parity knew what he was up against. He had heard some of these questions
109 before, although never under such conditions. "NET is not god. NET has no
110 aspirations. You can say we aren't different except in leaning from those
111 denizens we fight. But that is a mistake. Basic philosophical differences
112 exist between their ideology and NET's. We are not guns for hire. We don't
113 exort money. We work for a common good. We work on the side of good. We
114 play dirty only because that's the name of the game."
115    "Hogwash." The fourth face's turn. "You *are* no different than the Leroy
116 McKane's of the world. You seek global domination through power, money, and
117 violence. You use these tools in your everyday operation because it's a normal
118 course of action for you to shoot first and determine innocence later. What
119 say you to these accusations Parity. Can you defend your system?"
120     Parity paused before answering. 'This is delicate. I can't give away too
121 much. But I must respond.' "Just one moment gentlemen. I must ponder your
122 questions before answering."

168      A sliver of moonlight shone upon the inn, casting a strange, almost
169 hypnotic glow about it.  The rain was coming down in sheets, drenching the
170 realm with a gloom.  A worn and weary traveller wandered in for the night,
171 seeking repast and warmth, and found much more.  He now wishes to make 
172 more of it than a shelter from the mundane nature of other places, and
173 share this with the others, adding his light to the ones already here.
174 What say the natives?  Care for another regular?

223   Well! What a great vacation/retreat.  Let's see some more innovative 
224 stories on here.  I see e71 or whoever that guys is decided to start back up
225 a story that was, from what I can tell, absent for most of the time I was 
226 gone. Great. Just what we need -- story segments floating around like 
227 pieces of lint, trying to fall in the right place.  I was never impressed
228 with the story line much anyway (too predictable and 'regular' for this board).
229 What ever happened to that guy that wrote the thing about the Mima Mounds
230 or Almond Mounds or whatever it was?  Maybe he is reworking it like I told
231 him.  I was told via a phone call that Storyteller also had another one, 
232 but that it was not as good as the 'Chainsaw' one. Anybody still got it? 
233 Oh ya, this KWH guy or something like that...I am not impressed.  I somehow
234 doubt the telepath one was yours (not that great anyway), and the Innkeeper
235 line is way, way overworked on this board.  Anyway, I am glad to see that
236 Mike still has the board up when I got back.  Let's see some good stories
237 out here now...BE DIFFERENT...give us something that screams, reaches out 
238 and grabs us in sensitive areas and twists.  Let's have it!!!

245 KWH:  You asked for it....  What do you think of our KRITIK???  You wanted
246 KRITIcism,  you've got it now....  Although I don't really see HOW he doubts
247 the origin of your story unless he's seen it somewhere before or he thinks
248 it's too good.  I personally liked the beginning,  but it ended too abruptly.
249 Of course that was the point.  (I think)  Well,  LZ is about to come on 92.
250 (Yes people I like rock (old rock anyway))  And you KNOW I wouldn't miss that
251 for anything.   To pun or not to pun.....  Probably not, I don't want to submit
252 the people here with them although some (most) are good ones.  Besides, they
253 probably couldn't stand the punishment.  (Gawd!  Isn't that one getting old
254 already??)  Ahh,  there it is,  gotta run,  haven't heard that in a while...

258 IF YOU DECIDE TO STAY?  (NOTE KEEPER AND CCM OF LATE)  NOTHING.  SO DON'T
259 EVEN BOTHER ASKING IF WE WANT YOU ON HERE.  KRITIK, A GOOD REVIEW.
260 HOWEVER, CERTAIN THEMATICS HAVE SEEMED TO ESCAPE EVEN YOUR DISCRIMINATING EYE.
261 WHO CARES?

348 find the Blue Parrot well-suited to such conversations. Not to speak of just
349 being less embarrassed when criticism is particularly bad. What do you think
350 of that?

354 I think that you are yet another person trying to impress us with your
355 vocabulary.  Unfortunately, for you, your incomplete sentences, incorrect
356 verb conjugations and use of plural in a single structure betray your otherwise
357 not-so-impressive vocabulary.  Seth, you are to be commended on your spelling
358 abilities, but somehow I think all those words were looked up in a thesaurus
359 so you could hardly spell them wrong, now could you?  I'm not saying that I
360 didn't understand what your wrote (contra-positive, I know).  Quite the
361 contrary, I understood every word.  Your entry just smacks of thesaurus and in
362 this I criticize you.  I'm leaving this on BWMS to point out that I disagree
363 with your e-mail idea.

370 But the thesaurus is your friend!  I wouldn't have been able to expand my
371 vocabulary without one.  Or the dictionary, it even has 'hallucinogen' but
372 who really cares?  Allow each user to speak in such a manner that allows
373 them the best possible expression of their ideas.  If you understand, great;
374 if not, dig out the books!
375 Seth : I agree with you to a point.  A great deal of what we find on these
376 systems has about as much forethought as a sneeze.  The style on the other
377 hand is something one may control.  Sensitive matters such as How To Write
378 as decided by others may be a brutal thing to run into.  E-Mail may be one
379 way to soften the blows, although I prefer mano-a-mano encouters, time is
380 what I've found to be the greatest tutor.  Read, learn, mold, grow; we all
381 fugure it out after awhile.
382 Then again, there's nothing wrong with stumbling through writing in a dither
383 either.  (I've done it here, and I think I've grown from it before.  I think.)

415      THE SEA OF GREEN FLAMES
416      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
417 
418 Beware O ye of the world
419 for, watch who comes for you
420 the unholy man - of noneathly sheen
421 what he is, is eyes of green
422 from the sea   of unholy doctrain.
423 
424 Watch as you shall be devoured
425 with those seas of green.
426 For in Hell lives the God of pain
427 and on Earth lives the same
428 when we all git to Hell
429 we`ll see who you are,  O man
430                    of mortal shell.
431 
432 And then we`ll see
433 and my father shall soon end his
434                           courtisy
435 to you apon the Earth
436 O cattle of virtually no worth.
437 
438 I suffer not, I am unchained & free
439 who do you suppose can set free thee
440 Suffer as you will
441 look not upon me
442 I will laugh & walk the eternal path
443 and leve you far behind and
444 as you`ll see - Hell`s unkind..
445 
446 For by now you have not seen
447 what has guieded me & what I mean
448                SO
449 light a candle & weep a tear
450 for yourself, for your Earthly end
451           is now clear.

462     AEM: You would not have pointed out my errors on a public medium if you 
463 understood me. The reason I entered that was to point out that entries such 
464 as yours serve not only to point out errors, but to embarrass and humiliate 
465 as well. I didn't even ask you to show me what I did wrong. That you did is 
466 cruel. To defend myself: No, I had not tried to impress you with my grammar
467 or spelling. I tried to make myself clear.  Can you claim as fine a purpose 
468 for your entry?
469     SO: Reference books are wonderful. I agree with you. You've wandered to 
470 page after page also. Or so it seems. There is one word I chanced upon just 
471 tonight at about seven. Which is ERUDITION. Look it up. What a word it is.
472 Hope to see your name again around this place.

478  	"Imagine that!" Wilhelm took his own words to heart. 
479  His mind was possessed of sullen images. Aliens in old 
480  military uniforms, snatched from the quartermasters of doomed 
481  armies, slaughtering their way across the Continent of 
482  Europe. The very idea! It was so ridiculous he could not
483  bring himself to imagine why the BBC was airing it. Even in 
484  their science fiction programmes.

536    Hi all.  Haven"t seen you here in awhile, Lady S.  Nice to see 'ya back,
537 but I didn't think you had a terminal.  Hmm, wonder how you got the message 
538 in?  Ah well, glad to see you here.
539   Haven't seen many good stories lately.  If you didn't lioke my attempt at
540 it, then I suggest you try, oh ye Kritic.  One who criticizes should also 
541 be able to write, with the dergee of writing skill equaling the amount of
542 Critiquing skill.  We shall see what we shall see...

547   As a side note, backing up the cursor quickly does very strange things to
548 screen, like making one think one just sent 40 lines of blank verse.  Oh 
549 SysOp, please look into this, and find out why my terminal reacts like this
550 to yours.  Could it be that mine backs up faster than yours will allow, and 
551 sends a random ctrl character, or something else?  Very frustrating.  Please
552 see what you can do about this...
