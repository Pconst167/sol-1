59 Since the police issue was already handled by Mohamed, I will leave
60 that issue alone. On the matter of the airplane though, I think that
61 you will find that the lastest commercial liners don't even have direct
62 connections from the 'stick' to the control surfaces. (Jet fighters
63 did away with them a long time ago as it is a very poor way of controling
64 the plane. Now-a-days the controls run thru computers, and the computers
65 do the actual controlling. The vision of pilots man-handling aircraft
66 thru the skys is long gone. It is far more important to have a quick
67 wit and good judgment as well as good reflexes to handle emergencies
68 and not strength. Looking at the latest airplane accidents and near
69 accidents, I have found that they all were adverted or could have beed
70 adverted by wit and reflex, and not brute force.
71 As far as the whole thing about women shouldn't work where men now do
72 because they don't have the physical strength of a man, I find to be
73 a very narrow minded approach to life. If the woman can handle the
74 physical aspects of the job as it requires, I see no reason she should be
75 disqualified. On the same note, if a man applies for the job and can
76 not handle the physical aspects of it, he should not be given the job
77 just because he is a man.

81 MIKEY: AGREED-IF A PERSON CAN HANDLE THE JOB, THEN THEY SHOULD 
82 NOT BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR REASON OF SEX,RACE, ETC. HOWEVER
83 YOU ARE WRONG ABOUT THE AIRCRAFT. COMPUTERS NOTWITHSTANDING, THE FACT REMAINS
84 THAT THE CONTROL SURFACES ARE OPERATED HYDRAULICALLY, AND IF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE IS LOST, OR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED, THE ONLY
85 WAY TO CONTROL THE AIRCRAFT IS
86 BY HAVING THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH
87 TO OVERCOME THIS LOSS. THINK ABOUT IT-COMPUTERS CAN ONLY TELL THE AIRFOILS WHAT TO DO, NOT DO IT FOR THEM. THE SAME IS TRUE OF
88 THE AUTO-PILOT: IF THE "COMPUTER MALFUNCTIONS, AND WILL NOT LET
89 THE AUTO-PILOT DISENGAGE, THEN THE ONLY WAT TO CONTROL THE 'PLANE
90 IS BY PHYSICALLY OVERCOMING THE PROBLEM. I HAVE NEVER FLOWN A COMMERCIAL AIRLINER, ONLY SMALL
91 AIRCRAFT (CESSNA 150, 7ECA CITRABIA, ETC) BUT I HAVE ASKED THIS QUESTION OF PILOTS WHO ARE ATR'S, AND THEY HAVE VERIFIED WHAT 
92 I SAY. I LIKE LIVING TOO MUCH TO
93 PLACE MY LIFE IN ANYONES HANDS

173 2. Women in "traditionally" male oriented jobs: It has been my experience
174 that the female of our species is capable of accomplishing as much if not
175 more than the male. This stems from my past (as all experiences should)
176 in the days of yore. I was but a young man then, gone to seek fame, a
177 little fortune and some skills, and joined the US Air Force. At this time
178 the Armed Forces were going through the throes of placing women into what
179 had heretofore been MEN'S career skills. The general consensus amongst
180 the oldtimers and lifers was that it'd never get off the ground. I can
181 honestly say that they were full of BS. Those ladies work just as hard
182 as any man. Oh sure, there were a few that moped about and refused to 
183 give a hundred percent. They either got tranfered to a WOMAN'S job or
184 discharged under one of a dozen regs. As a rule however, they did just
185 fine, thankyou and how about passing me that multimeter huh? For those
186 who feel a womens' place is in the home I can only say WAKE UP!!!!!

221        Your 'word' means nothing.  You are certainly

223        the wrong way: margins, logon, logoff, signiture
224        and just about everything else.
225        Think up some other name and be original, use
226        a little thought and be a little creative. Just
227        copying old entries will just prove how much you
228        don't use your mind.  Not to mention how much
229        you look like a bozo for doing it.
230 :=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:
231  To Shtoner:
232 
233        You are not discussing anything!  You are mearly
234        stating your popsition on the subject.  People
235        are to look at both sides of an argument, not
236        just one.  Ignorance will get you nowhere.  
237 :=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:
238  I must agree with one thing Shtoner said about this,
239  "God works in mysterious ways" is a great cop out when
240  you don't want to face the facts.
241  Also, this thing about "Gods will".  Was it Gods will
242  for two young boys to be shot along with a very young
243  baby at a McDonalds?
244 :=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:=:
245 ----------------------------------------
246 I will now present the argument. I should not do this, I {now from past 
247 experience that this will lead nowhere but I simply HAVE too!
248 The argument for the 2 little boys and`a baby is this, GOD wantel`them in
249 heaven, he wanted them all in heaven for being such good christians. The gun
250 wielding man was a deciple of god.
251 Now, you have an argument, what I have just said`is some of the most amazing
252 BS I have ever come up with, and yet some people would and do believe it!
253 Quite simply, there is no devine god at all. I do know from experience that
254 there are some things out there that need to be explained away, but not
255 by thinking that a god/devel is responsible for them.

258 I have never seen such a poorly worded argument against religion
259 as that put forward by shtoner. You sir, and I use the term
260 loosly, are doing more to further the cause of organized religion
261 than any of others here on this bulletin board, by your use of
262 situation that happens to suit your need at the moment. If you
263 are really so againt religion, why don't you come up with some-
264 thing truly original, instead of rehashing age-old arguments
265 like you are doing now. Your last two messages have been printed
266 off, and are currently posted on our local message board for
267 all to read and laugh at. In this aspect, I thank you for the
268 entertainment. If you are really trying to fight this thing called
269 organized religion, you can help best by keeping your banal
270 arguments to yourself, and not interfering with those who know
271 what they are doing. Please refrain from this tirade you have
272 decided to go on, and switch to something you seem to know
273 more about, like the lack of schooling people are getting these
274 days. Again, your messages could be used as a 'See what can
275 happen' example.

304 ation(ma 80?!?) Secondly, I was using the subject at hand, the little kids
305 being shot, it did not "suit me at the moment" It is hard to come up with 
306 an argument that is truly origional  when the subject has been debated for c
307 ountless years. You yourself have proven this because you did not present ev
308 en a counter argument to my meek meanderings. Instead, you chose to laugh at
309 me and call me a fool. You sir, are the fool in my eyes.
310 I am I take it, a good example of what can happen when. When what?
311 I would appreciate it if you would tell me just which board it is that
312 my "humor" has been posted on, I would like to see it for myself and to see

321 shtoner - I must agree with Mr. H. Johnson.  You are a prime example of
322 how poor the educational system is becoming.  Or, in the vernacular
323 of the Inn's temporal climate, 'Wouldst that thou couldst learn to 
324 spell.
325 
326 all - the religious discusions that we have had in the past have been
327 most exciting, and we may even bring back the wit and wisdom of such
328 past participants as Deborah, DOM, CYM, etc.  It might indeed be 
329 interesting.  (At least the level of grammar, spelling, and punct-
330 uation would rise, on an aggregate level)
331 
332 all - (again)  I think a more interesting subject, and surely more
333 timely at this point, would be the upcoming presidential race.  If one
334 is to believe the polls, Reagan/Bush have dropped behind Mondale/
335 Ferrarro.  What the pollsters seem to have ignored is that we are not
336 operating in a democracy, but rather, a republic.  
337      To start the discussion off, I offer my humble opinion.  If the
338 democrats regain the presidency, the middle class had better believe
339 in God, as that is all that will save them from the 'equalization'
340 the democrats will propose.  The 'entitlement' programs the demo's
341 are so much in favor of are merely a way of stealing from the middle
342 and giving to the poor and lazy end of the economy.  That, my friend,
343 is Socialism.

428    NEW YORK (AP) - A joyous recovery on Wall Street today culminated a day that
429 saw Bunker Hunt, the noted Southern business man and silver dealer, give a
430 captivating speech to the Stock Brockers of America Club.
431    
432    In his speech, during which there were eight interruptions due to standing
433 ovations, Mr. Hunt urged the stock brokers in attendance to not panic in
434 the light of the recent death of world financier Leroy Mckane.
435 
436    "You must remember this!", Hunt said to the packed room at the NYSE diner,
437 "Mckane was only a single man, and nothing compared to the combined monetary
438 weight of your clients!"
439 
440    Hunt continued to downplay the recent death of Mckane, which has been
441 attributed to an accidental explosion of a thermometer. Each time Hunt
442 paused in his speech, thunderous applause arose from the audience of some
443 1200 stock brokers, who are members of the nation's largest and most respected
444 Stock Exchange organization.
445 
446    After his speech, Hunt autographed hundreds of copies of his most recent
447 book, "Silver and Gold, a biography of Burl Ives"
448 
449    The late afternoon rally, which saw several Wall Street records broken, was
450 directly attributed to Hunt's empassioned speech.
451 
452    Afternoon trading reached 78 million shares, as stocks rose 32 points, and
453 winners outnumbered loosers 7 to 1.
454 
455    "I have never seen anything like it", said former Reagan economist Martin
456 Feldstein, in a rare NYSE appearance. "For stocks to rise this much on the
457 weight of one man's speech, is incredible. Yet all indicators point to
458 continued gains in the Dow Jones Index. With the incredible weight of the
459 Mckane financial empire of the backs of many companies, we are seeing a
460 renewed interest in the welfare of the entire country's economy. I expect the
461 stock prices to hit the magic 1200 mark in the space of one week."

465 A debate on politics! Oh boy oh boy oh boy! Just what I have been waiting for.
466 Here are a couple of observations. Programmers, and technical people as a whole,
467 tend to be rather conservative. They see themselves as successful, and can't
468 understand why others are not the same way. They tend to vote republican, since
469 the republican economic views tie more closely with their own. They have little
470 tolerance with such democratic institutions has welfare, and medicare. They do
471 however, seem to be quite aware of current events, and sometimes modify their
472 beliefs if the need arises.
473 Also, since the choice is now down to two distinct choices, does anyone out
474 there have the feeling that, "However I vote, it will merely be for the lesser
475 of two evils."?
476 Did anyone watch the latest presidential press conference? Would anyone like to
477 share their opinions on it?
478 I don't mean to ignore the religous debate brewing at the Inn, but it is a
479 subject that has been thrown about so many times, that I think it may be nice
480 to see a change in the flavor of the debate!
481 )*)%$*%)$*#%)$#*% L'homme sans parity - parler! parler vers politiques! *)%*$)%
482 Oh yes...Alex... Either date sounds fine with me. Maybe the 11th since it will
483 be after a PorSFiS meeting, and we can carpool out to your place. But...are
484 you sure you want to subject yourself to nuclear fallout again? Also, please
485 let us bring some goodies to eat, so we won't munch away your monthly food

489 "do you think he will survive?" asked the intern.
490 " good chance, the religiodebateacillin seems to be working nicely now"
491 In the bed, the subject rises and screams wildly "there wrong, spelling has 
492 nothing to do with it, there all full of crud!! there using names never before
493 seen on the board!!" just then doctor twitson yelled "another half-amp of valium!"
494 "Gee, who cares about it, lets talk politics for a few days" the subject again.
495 "well, he seems to be all right,better watch him though, and don't let him get 
496 neer to any computer terminals!"
497 "Yes sir, glad we got to him first."

501 back. How be the leg? I should be home from 6 a.m. to noon, let it ring a few hundred times, Ii may be doing yard work.
502 I REFUSE to join in a debate, unless of course, I am asked too!

519 I have decided that Hon. M. is not evil.  At her center is a
520 solemn child staring into an abyss.  To protect this child,
521 she has trained her body as a sexual tool and weapon, but the
522 child is still afraid.  To nourish this child she has omnipo-
523 tent lovers like McKaneand yet the child starves.  To amuse
524 this child she is a luridly wanton adventuress, but the child
525 feels no pleasure.  The only only person to ever ever touch
526 that child is Petrov, agent of ambiguity.  What bothered her
527 about Petrov was that she couldn't figure out whether he was
528 betraying McKane as a rebel against the king of evil or as a
529 pretender to the throne.  Hearing the rumors about Petrov
530 leaving the Plaza prior to the blast, she ran to her room.
531 Rocky is in another disguise; this time he's a butcher with a
532 droopy little mustache, a big white apron, a cute paper cap
533 and a big shiny cleaver which he buries in the door beside M's
534 face as she enters wearing 3-inch heels and a Joan Crawford
535 mouth.  "Red letter woman!!!! You can't give all the stocks
536 and bank numbers from the Okeydokey city suckers to that snake
537 Hunt!!"  And before our eyes he EATS the key to the stock and
538 code book file.  It is a small key.  M. looks disgusted and
539 saunters off saying, "I detest that man's wardrobe."

543 Good grief!  I think someone went crazy after I talked to them on the
544 phone this afternoon!
545 Alex:  As of this moment, either date mentioned is acceptable.  As someone
546 commented earlier, though, the 11th might be better since it is a PorSFiS
547 day, and several of us could carpool again.

550 I AWOKE JUST AS THE SUN CAST IT'S FIRST RAYS OF GOLDEN LIGHT
551 ,FINGERLIKE, ACROSS THE TREETOPS, PAINTING A SILHOUETTE
552 ACROSS THE FACE OF THE CLIFFS ABOVE ME.IT DANCED AND FLICKERED
553 AS THE TREES WAVED IN THE EARLY MORNING BREEZE.
554    THE LAKE WAS YET UNTOUCHED BY THE LIGHT, AND LAY IN NEAR DARK
555 NESS, THE STILLNESS BROKEN ONLY BY THE OCCASIONAL 'SPLOOK' OF A FISH BREAKING 
556 THE SURFACE, AND THE GENTLE RUSTLING OF BULLRUSHES AND CATTAILS
557 TODAY I WOULD CROSS THE LAKE, AND BEGIN MY ASCENT ON THE FOOTHILLS
558 , THE MAP GUIDING ME TOWARD THE PASSAGE WAY-THROUGH THE CLIFF
559 FACES, AND INTO THE VALLEY THAT LAY BEYOND.
560 I REBUILT THE FIRE, AND MADE TEA, AND THEN TAKING THE LEATHER
561 BOUND BOOK FROM MY RUCKSACK, I TURNED TO THE JOURNAL, AND THE
562 ENTRIES MADE BY THE VILLAGE ELDERS. 
563 THIS WOULD BE THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OFMY JOURNEY, AND AS I READ
564 THE WORDS AND SYMBOLS, I REMEMBERED WHAT MY FATHER HAD
565 SAID THAT DAY, SO LONG AGO. I REMEMBERED THE SADNESS IN HIS
566 VOICE, AND, SOMEHOW, THE TASK THAT
567 LAY AHEAD OF ME SEEMED EASIER TO ACCEPT. "YOU MUST NOT FAIL" MY FATHER HAD TOLD 
568 ME. AND THEN HE WENT AWAY, NEVER TO RETURN. 
569    "IN THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1143, IN THE SEVENTH MONTH AND THE
570 24TH DAY, SOL SAHLL NOT SHINE, AND LUNA SHALL GIVE NO LIGHT"
571 "AND IN THE 3RD DEGREE OF CAPRICORNUS SHALL LUNA RISE".
572 I REMEMBERED THE ELDERS EXPLAINING IT TO ME. HOW THE PATTERN
573 OF STARS IN THE CONSTELLATION CANCER POINTED TO THE PASSAGEWAY
574 
575 EACH YEAR, AT THE SUMMER SOLSTICE,BUT COULD NOT BE SEEN
576 BECAUSE OF THE BRIGHTNESS OF HE SUN. DEMONSTRATING WITH THE ASRSASBS
577 "THE ASTROLABE", THEY EXPLAINED.IT WOULD BE ONLY ONCE EVERY THREE HUNDRED YEARS 
578 OR SO, THAT A SOLAR ECLIPSE WOULD FALL IN THE FIRST DEGREES
579 OF CANCER, AND DARKEN THE SUN S
580 SO THAT THE STARS COULD POINT THE WAY.THEN, THE PASSAGEWAY COULD BE FOUND.
581 I TOOK ANOTHER SIGHTING WITH MAP AND TWIG, AND FOUND AN OUTCROPPING

586    "Fifty minutes left."  I mouthed the words silently while standing in the Hilton's lobby.  My ears could vaguely discern 
587 the voices of an elite group of individuals who were incompetently discussing religious matters.  Such discussions never
588 solved any questions but they did serve to make the participants feel more secure in their marvelously inadequate beliefs.
589    Turning my back on the arguers I found a more interesting scene.  Taking place in the hotel was a science fiction meeting.
590 My eyes beheld a room full of individuals being brutally tortured.  They were watching as someone read a terrible book while
591 others acted the story out.  During all this, the observers placed bids on whether or not they should continue.
592   I felt the overpowering urge to leave, and was amused to see a large group of people doing just that.  Once on the street my
593 mind was consumed again by the need to seek my destiny as leader of McKane industries.
594 TIME PASSES
595   The world crisis brought about by the death of Leroy McKane had passed it's climax and the stock market was well on it's
596 way to recovery.  Having played the market intelligently, I found myself with a great deal of money.  Furthering my plans for
597 taking over McKane Industries, I met with Honored Matre.
598    "I know the thoughts and schemes of everyone who could call themselves your adversary," she said.  H. Matre, I well knew,
599 had the ability to find out just about anything she wanted.  "What you need to do now is take over key financial industries.
600 The Mckane organization is on the verge of collapse and needs someone to guide it."
601    I realized that too.  It would be much easier to claim the throne if I solidly controlled some sources of income.  Present
602 target:  Rent-a-miracle.  "That's a popular industry which will bring me much fame when I save it from imminent bankrupcy." 
603 H. Matre smiled in a calculated way which made me wonder what she was thinking.
604    Anyway, the loan was floated and I was well on my way to gaining the power which I deserved.
605    ...My mind drifted regretfully back to the two men who I was forced to eliminate with a small time bomb...

609 I seem to have started something.  From Intellectualism to Women's Rights and beyond.  I wonder at the the logic of 
610 such a sequence.
611 Here is another question: Do you believe that the reason BW writing goes in cycles is that the members just get tired 
612 of one sort of writing, and look for something new?  Is that the cause of adventures being bogged down?  Would it be 
613 better to just 'drop' the story for the duration of the debates, and then pick up again after one's imagination has 
614 come to life again?  Is the cycle just another form of crop rotation, with the fantasy plot of land fgoing fallow?
