28 It's the season of flowers; of carnations, violets, and  roses.
29      A time when fond desires begin to blossom into romance.
30                The tender young buds begin to form 
31            In readiness to burst forth in the spring.
32 
33      What secrets are shared in the night's gathering gloom?
34              What whispered embrace has been formed?
35 
36         For through the winter storm of icy chill blasts,
37      A warmth and persevering strength has protected the bud
38            In preparation for the new spring to come.
39 
40       Life begins anew when the warm rains of spring begin.
41              When the sweet tears of love have come.
42 
43     And whispered in dark corners where two heads are as one;
44                    My love, my life, be mine?

51 To all of those that have given me kind words ( few really ) Thank you.
52 I feel as if I am taking to much time to myself by putting this in, but it 
53 is something I feel about Back Water. Since I met a "user" on Saturday, this
54 feeling has been confirmed. It is sad to think what would happen if this
55 system would be turned off, like a couple of other systems have that I have
56 used. This feeling is best understood if you have listened to a song by The
57 Eagles called "HOTEL CALIFORNIA". It is the way I feel here. 
58 If anyone calls up this system and uses it for more than about a week, they
59 might fall into this tender trap. The stories I would read were more the
60 fantasy style, like those of Tarn, Milchar (hello), Inkeeper, and Leo. They
61 all seemed to be so bright. I'm sorry, I forgot about Piper. They also 
62 showed what I hope were some true personalities. The feelings were so strong
63 and I felt that I was right there.
64 The point I wanted to make, and I thinked I may have slipped, is this:
65    You are welcome to come in if you want to.
66    If you don't like what see, you can leave and no one will notice, maybe.
67    If you do like what you see, ( like me ) you can not leave 
68       even if you want to. It will start to mean too much to you.
69 I feel like I will be losing a whole lot of friends if I have to leave. I
70 know I hate it when I miss an entire disk. Since I don't call up that often
71 I usually have a bunch of reading to do when I come back. Sometime 
72 everything! I only know that there are two people that feel the way that I 
73 do and was wondering if anyon else felt this way too. Like you couldn't 
74 leave even if you had to.
75 This is cruel, I have set myself up. I'm sorry for wasting time. I'll go now.
76                                          Becky T.

143   Guardian -- (thanks for the clarification)  Please proceed!  I look forward
144 with great intrest to your entry.
145   Becky T -- It happens.  Somehow you get involved with this group and find
146 yourself addicted to sharing.  If you will forgive the maunderings, I'll
147 give you a little history of "telecomputing", which some call this activity.
148   In the beginning was CBBS.  It alone was a light in the darkness and
149 has endured undimmed since then.  Shortly thereafter, two more systems came
150 on line -- The Backwater Message System and ABBS (Apple Bulletin Board
151 System).  I'm not sure just in what order Backwater and ABBS came on --
152 memory does fail at times -- but the ABBS seemed to be progressing well.
153 It went up to 1.2 Mb. on line, numerous contributors, features, etc.
154 (I had a weekly book review, several others like L'Homme had spaces or
155 made substantial contributions.)  Unfortunately, the ABBS was the first
156 victem of concentrated twittery.  The twits -- tiny persons with even smaller
157 minds -- made the system operator, Jeff Freidman, so irritated that he no
158 longer took any pleasure in operating the system.  The shock, for me, of
159 losing my first "home" was devastating.  I had been a frequent visitor of
160 backwater and CBBS, but with the demise of the system where I had put so much
161 effort, I lost much heart.  It was over a year later that I felt even the 
162 faint stirrings of an urge to become part of another system.  By then,
163 the Backwater had taken on the identity of "the inn" and gradually I began
164 to contribute towards maintaining this metaphysical structure.  I have 
165 actually emerged from my physical isolation and met, in the flesh,
166 some of the innhabitants, or innklings as they seem to be calling themselves
167 now.  Unfortunately, this meeting (which has occured twice) requires me to
168 thread a pickup truck through the wilderness of the city streets -- a feat
169 of which I am only marginally capable.  I would far rather be driving along
170 a grease-slick mountain road, treading the thin line of disaster and depending
171 only upon my own capabilities, rather than sharing the streets with others
172 who find it embarassingly easy to bluff out that fool in the pickup.
173 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
174 *******************************************************************************
175 piper:  thanks for the info, as a "new" modemer like becky t, it's neat to
176         get background information.  so the twits have been around since the
177         beginning of time? and so be that they shall be a very important part
178         of our system, after all, whom whould we have to threaten and scream
179         at?  i myself take great pride in b*****y well, maybe my gender has
180         something to do with that.. and now look who's rambling on...
181         anyway, thanks again, sorry about the near miss on the road; im saying
182         that in a generic term. and this will help me to drive more consideratly
183         im crawling under my rock for a while, ill be watching with interest.

266 there is no choice

302     The Former looked down into the swirling white cream of his drink, and let the tankart cap fall down into place.  Somehow
303 the drink did not appeal to him as it had before he made it.  It was a drink prepared with the powders of some nuts, and even
304 though it bore no alcohol, it was somewhat near the quality of the Inn's ale.
305 
306     The Former did niot drink, as a rule, except for the few occaisions that he did not mind that he would ache later.  No
307 matter what the form, it always seemed to make the Former ache to drink a lot of alcohol.
308 
309     Far too many people were engrossed in several conversations about trees to notice him looking nervously into the cup, and
310 then dropping the tankart lid, the open it and look nervously into the cup.  Was funny to see.

333 Becky T.  That feeling is also in me.  All the places there are to go and this
334 is the one I like the best.  Backwater is fun to read, heartwarming and so many
335 more.  It makes the other systems look so drab and mundane.  If the Inn were
336 taken away (never I hope) all the creativity would go down the drain, there 
337 isn't anywhere else to go.  There is something about this board that makes it
338 easy for people to express how they feel and what they think.
339           Oh, I don't think you wasted any space on this disk at all, you have
340 brought something into the light that people like to talk about.  I hope to

345   Lets take at thought for the moment the theory of evolution. We supposedly evolved from apes, but couldn't we have been 
346 put here by a higher life form and gained the knowdledge that we have today from our experiences of yesterday.
347  Which leads to my thought....
348 
349  Man has began creating man, but in a mechanical form. After many more generations couldn't these mechanical men
350 begin gaining a new knowdledge from their yesterdays, and wouldn't evolution begin again with a new form of man.
351  
352  Now lets jump centurys into the future. Man(anotomical) is gone from the earth, our mechanical replicas are still thriving,
353 evolving. 
354 
355  Haven't we began a new evolution with the robotics and artificial inteligence we have created. Finally, when we are gone 
356 we will still be here in the form of our creations.

367 Let's all celebrate, folks! Not only are we priviliged to have the use of the finest creative and political forum I
368 have ever seen (take a bow, Mikey), but today (12 February) marks the first anniversary of another (albeit less unusual)
369 BBS in town. Yes, Le Nerd is one year old tonight, and I hope everyone who can get through will call in to join the
370 celebration. Merriment will abound, with no guarantee of decorum on anyone's part. I'll be there, you come too...

376   we may have started another process of evolution... but at the same time... it can be said that the earth did... in
377 the same way also... so was earth what many people call god... or are the same people right... and god created earth...
378 and thus started the process of evolution...
379   it not possible then... that god was created in a process of evolution... and in that way... he created man in his own

403 {somewhat which he should have brought with him, so he returned privily and   }
404 {entered his apartments, where he found the Queen, his wife, asleep on his own}
405 {carpet-bed, embracing with both arms a black cook of loathsome aspect and    }
406 {foul with kitchen grease and grime. When saw this the world waxed black be-  }
407 {fore his sight and he said, "If such case happen while I am yet within sight }
408 {of the city what will be the doings of this damned whore during my long ab-  }
409 {sence at my brother's court?" So he drew his scymitar and cutting the two in }
410 {four pieces with a single blow, left them on the carpet and returned present-}
411 {ly to his camp without letting anyone know of what had happened. Then he gave}
412 {orders for immediate departure and set out at once and began his travel; but }
413 {he could not help thinking over his wife's treason and he kept saying to him-}
414 {self; "How could she do this deed by me? How could she work her own death?," }
415 {till excessive grief seized him, his colour changed to yellow, his body waxed}
416 {weak and he was threatened with a dangerous malady, such an one as bringeth  }
417 {men to die. So the Wazir shortened his stages and tarried long at the water- }
418 {ing-stations and did his best to solace the King. Now when Shah Zaman drew   }
419 {near the capital of his brother he despatched vaunt-couriers and messengers  }
420 {of glad tidings to announce his arrival, and Shahryarcame forth to meet him  }
421 {with his Wazirs and Emirs and Lords and Grandees of his realm; and saluted   }
422 {him and joyed with exceeding joy and caused the city to be decorated in his  }
423 {honour. When, however, the brothers met, the elder could not but see the     }
424 {change of complexion in the younger and questioned him of his case whereto he}
425 {replied, "Tis caused by the travails of wayfare and my case needs care, for I}
426 {have suffered from the change of water and air! but Allah be praised for re- }
427 {uniting me with a brother so dear and so rare!" On this wise he dissembled   }
428 {and kept his secret, adding, "Oh King of the time and Caliph of the tide,    }
429 {only toil and moil have tinged my face yellow with bile and hath made my eyes}
430 {sink deep in my head."                                                       }

436 Ah Mohammed...you tempt me. You try to lure me into another 
437 adventure, but I can't. My time is so taken with the victums 
438 of rapisits, molestors, and firesetters that I haven't time 
439 for Backwater. I barely have time to download and scan the 
440 highlights of the action. Ah for the time for a Backwater 
441 adventure. But believe me, my friend, that being a casemanager
442 for Children's Services is far more bizaare an adventure than
443 anything I've seen at the Inn. The difference is that it is
444 more personal, more exciting, and it's for real.    Grand D.

451 has done me a great favor while my car was headless, but now things return to normal, and GAWD it's great! Besides
452 increasing horsepower by fourfold, I can now listen to FM radio too. It may take me a day or two to get used to my
453 old pony again. You wouldn't believe the differences between a Fiat and a Mustang! But enough of that! Your entry was
454 indeed welcome. With the recent vacation of agent voyeur, and the umpteen attemps by the self-proclaimed pseudo-agents,
455 it is good to have another fine voice in the fold. Welcome M. Author. Welcome!
456 Piper:Uhoh... Can you say deep %$#%? I knew you could. How am I gonna extract myself now. Take two happens tomorrow.
457 I remember the good old ABBS system. I remember well your book review column. You always started out by opening the
458 creaking door, entering the book room, etc... Who was I toput TRS-80 program reviews on an Apple board? Oh well, the
459 jokes were better received. Remember the statue story? It seems like only yesterday. I remember how saddened everyone
460 was when Jeff was forced off the air. Sometimes I wish I didn't remember so well. A good memory can be depressing at
461 times.
462 And now... I will pass on the enter torch to my distinguished lawyer friend, who has presented me with an interesting
463 case:
464 
465                                                                 Steve Neighorn

467 who is that guy?                                                     ^
468 What happened to the case?
469 :::::::::::O O:::::::::02/12:::::::::::::::::23:25:::::::::::O O::::::::::::
470 Hmmm.. L'homme seems to have faded away into oblivion (or Neighorn; same difference..)
471 MesoMath: Surprise surprise!  I was aware of the alchemist/MM, but the << * >>
472 escapes me for the moment.  But -- Melissa??  You set that one up well.
473 I remember her appearing on CBBS/NW, looking for a board.  The description of
474 the board she was looking for matched BackWater remarkably well, and I subsequently
475 experienced a bit of suspicion, but You were never the subject.  I saw a message
476 from Pam on Bit bucket, implying that she was here in disguise, so I thought maybe
477 her.  Or, one of the other 'regulars' was playing Melissa.  Or even, perhaps
478 she was a real person (unlikely, I know, but stranger things have happened.)
479 It has often been suggested for some regular to appear on BackWater (a male)
480 using a female nom de plume, to test out the hypothesis that being a woman
481 on this board entitles you to 25 brownie points of extra praise automatically.
482 Did you find it so?  I seem to recall that it was not disproved.
483 Now, THE QUESTION: what prompted this great disclosure?  Tired of the masquerade?
484 Or are you (shudder..) abandoning us and shipping out for alternate ports?
485 Whatever the case, Bravo!

487 Oh how I hate the sloppy syntax resultant from Enter Only!

490 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (the mask dropped, will be found later)
491 Probably the only reason that I am doing this is because I am fighting to get
492 these words out in the "open" and, I know that once I have released them I will
493 not be able to recant them do to the incredable dare set before me by E/ONLY.
494 It has been said that "a man is the sum of his memories... [and his experinces]
495 ..." This being the case, how much of a man can there be if there has only been
496 but one experience in his life?  True, it would be difficult in these times to
497 live off having had ONLY one experience to call from. Of course what I am 
498 leading to is not the total of all experiences, but those that may be numbered
499 in a particularly delicate field- the field of Love.
500 As these words are struggled, just as hard as if from my lips, I will attempt
501 there entry with as little or no regret as possible. Onward.
502 When one first falls in love things seem to change, anthough unnoticed, their
503 change is inevitable. Little things are thrown from the mind and other things
504 take their place. Points at hand: love songs on the radio and, a constant 
505 drifting of the mind back to the one they love. (Silly but true)
506 I would enter more now but, the one that has caused this in me requires 
507 my attention to sooth the heartache.
508 I will continue, for I shall end what I have started. I must.

577 
578 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (before the mask is lifted)
579 I was asked why I put such an entry here. Isn't it the best place to get things
580    off one's chest semi-anonymously? Anyway, back to the Onward.
581 Those songs that go rambling through your head somehow get turned around to 
582 mean something special between the two in love. Which will lead back to the
583 drifting of the mind. Once I fell in love, all I could remember hearing on the
584 radio was love songs, nothing but them. I also found myself wondering just 
585 where I was once the song was over because I would lose track of reality.
586 That was what will soon be Three whole years ago. Three years that I will some-
587 how relate to being One of my experiences. Since then, the two of us have been
588 the very best of friends and have done many things, gone many places together.
589 What eventually happens to two friends in love is that they will be forced to
590 go their own ways sooner or later. It has turned out to be later and that later
591 is now. In the past year things have been steadily decaying due to my neglect
592 for maintaining things from day to day. Days would become weeks and, tempers
593 would become short. Once the temper would show, it would be the cause for more
594 delay. How can I go meet someone when I know they are angry at me? I know I
595 didn't want to go back because the mood would not be condusive to a better
596 relationship, even though that was the purpose. Things became so confusing and
597 I would let the state of decay continue. 
598 Now, when I have come to terms that the best thing to do would be to end the 
599 cause of such greif, emotions can only bring to mind only the good times. Why
600 does the mind have to play such tricks? I   DO   want to bring an end to it,
601 (No, L'homme- I don't mean suicide) but I don't want to leave thinking that I
602 won't still be her friend. She has said that it is also her fear. I have told
603 her that we will still be friends (why does that sound so corny?) and that I
604 will still be here, but the fear still remains.
605 A clean cut does not seem possible, but I will have to make it such before
606 she will leave on her own accord, a different choice that would have brought
607 about her own chice for the future.   I think that lost in the translation...
608 Tears could be heard on the phone, and could be seen once I came to try to make
609 her feel a bit more at ease. Still, time goes on. I will stand by my decisions,
610 there is to much else in the world to do to let this slow me down. I must live
611 life as it is given to me, and as I shape it. There is no other way.
612 Would I be so terribly wrong to fall in love with someone else before I have
613 made the final seperation? I don't think so- but why do I feel the guilt?
614 These are to be some of the things that I will be able to call on as
615 experiences that I may draw on for the future.
