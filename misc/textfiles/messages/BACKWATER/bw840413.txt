21 The Poet awoke with a start. This alone was enough to put him through 
22 spasms of agony, as his head had somehow swollen several sizes overnight.
23 Looking around,he found himself in a strange place. Hmmmm, the last he
24 recalled, he'd been having a grand time with some new-found friends at...
25 the Inn? No... somehow he'd gotten to somewhere else, he recalled. It 
26 hadn't seemed too important at the time, but his dislocation took on more
27 serious implications in the cold, wet  light of morning. Wet? Yes,
28 apparently he'd spent the night outdoors sleeping in the rain. Now, where
29 was he... at that moment a native passed by dressed in some sort of 
30 ritual costume or uniform. From the way he was running he was late for 
31 something, so rather than delay him the poet steeled himself against the
32 pain and tried to run along with him.
33 "Excuse (unh) me, but could (puff,puff) you tell me where I (gasp) am?"
34 "What are you, an idiot? Joggers don't carry spare change, so beat it!"
35 Ah... This "Joggers" must be some sort of religious group... "I don't 
36 need any spare change (Wheeze). I just woke up here and (grunt) don't 
37 know where I am. Could you (unnhh) please tell me?"
38 "In the South Park Blocks. You people are disgusting, why can't you 
39 stay up north on Burnside where you belong?" 
40 The "Jogger" put on a sudden burst of speed, leaving the oxygen-starved
41 Poet behind. Oh, well. Looking at the cloud layer overhead he found a 
42 lighter spot that must be the sun; from this he guessed that this
43 direction must be north, where "Burnside" lay. Turning to face it, he 
44 began walking...hopefully the hurried fellow knew enough that the Poet 
45 might find some of his friends from the Inn on this "Burnside". He hoped
46 that it wasn't more than a day's walk away...

50         I stepped outside and began to take my morning walk to get my
51 breakfast, and I realized that something was amiss.  The ground was quite
52 hard.  Pavement? Wait, this cant be the reality I was in when I went to
53 bed.  Must be that crazy piper again.  Hmmm....  No bolo's, can't be
54 that far of a time lapse.  I decided to follow the blacktop strip in
55 front of me and try to figure out where I was, and where I could get
56 breakfast

62      The  rain had been pouring down for weeks now,  and still it 
63 did not letup.   The small patch of ground I had taken refuge  on 
64 had become a island in a boiling sea of mud and water. 
65      My luck has seemed to run out on me this time, for even as I 
66 watch  the  last bit of ground gives way to the ever  encroaching 
67 water. 
68      My equipment,  my tent, everything I carried with me is long 
69 since gone, damaged or carried off by the raging water.
70      Clinging to the last remaining tree still standing,  I  know 
71 that  the  end  is  near as the waters  slowly  but  inescapeably 
72 continue to raise. Soon the water will rise to cover my head, and 
73 my failed mission will be at an end.   Wet and chilled I cling to 
74 the tree,  yet for some reason I am not afraid, perhaps because I 
75 know that it wouldn't make any difference if I were.
76      The  water has risen to my chin now,  it won't be  too  much 
77 longer.   My  only regret is not finding the object of by  search 
78 the one called PAM.  But,  it is too late for regrets now. As the 
79 water  rises over my head,  and the darkness enfolds me I do  not 
80 even  notice that the last tree that was standing that I was  now 
81 clinging to was a Rowan tree.
82      Sometime later a man appears beneath the Rowan tree  outside 
83 the Inn, his hands clasped about it in a death grip.  The body is 
84 naked and soaked from the pouring rain and covered with mud.   he 
85 does  not move,  perhaps he is dead?   The rain continues to pour 
86 down on the man, little rivlets running down thru his thick brown 
87 hair and across his cheek, while his steel gray eyes stare out at 
88 nothing.  A dark cloak fluters down from out of the Rowan tree to 
89 cover his still body, and the rain continues to pour down........

137    It must have been that bass drone reed.  It didn't sound right --
138 I had to pull the drone and restress the reed, and it was double-toning.
139 Now here I am -- I must admit that the tavern was quite nice -- brick walls
140 a pool table, warm, out of the rain.  I really don't like this reality.  
141 Too many loud machines, people with the look of quiet desperation in their
142 eyes, pavement, pavement everywhere.  The stone beneath my feet is not 
143 pleasurable to walk upon, the river that I saw was walled off from all
144 possibility of contact.  Strangely dressed persons come out of doorways,
145 the whole ambience is that of self-involvement.  Where are my companions?
146 I do not have the skills to long survive in an urban atmosphere -- if I
147 don't come across them soon, I'm heading for the hills.

150 The Poet had been wandering, quite lost, for most of the day. No stranger 
151 to cities, he nevertheless was having problems with this one. It lacked the
152 friendly charm of the more low-tech urban settings he prefered, yet without
153 the cleanliness and efficiency of his brother's haunts in 45th century 
154 Noram. Still, the place was not without its charms... one young lady
155 offered him a friendly chat about "Signtolgy", apparently some sort of 
156 religious organization (these people seemed to have a lot of those). Knowing
157 from experience in the Inn that the proper response was to start a friendly
158 argument he did so, but for some reason she took offense and left in a huff.
159 So, having long since forgotten his original purpose (as Poets are wont to 
160 do) he contented himself with wandering about, gazing with fascination
161 through the broad windows put forward by the trusting merchants to display
162 their wares. As the day wore into evening, he found himself at the doors 
163 of a corner drinking-place wishing he had some coin of this realm with 
164 which to buy some refreshment. As he gazed enviously through the window at 
165 the patrons enjoying themselves within he heard a familiar sound. Could it
166 be...? He burst through the door into the conversation-stopping drone of a
167 very familiar music. It was! 
168 "PIPER! I'M SO GL" the pipes stopped, but the Poet continued shouting "AD 
169 TO SEE YOU!"

175 I stood there, frozen in panic at the sight of the large beast approaching
176 so rapidly, until the Bard reached forward, grasped my clothing, and jerked
177 me out of the way.  While I leaned, weak-kneed, against the wall, Bard
178 proceeded to remind me of some of the hazards of a high-tech urban
179 environment.  I had enjoyed the tales told in the Inn, but never did I
180 imagine what these things were Really like.  
181 Deciding I needed a drink after the terrible ordeal, I re-entered the
182 tavern.  Avoiding the unfriendly barkeep, I returned to my table, fell
183 into my chair, and took a large swig of my ale.
184 After my nerves had settled down a bit, I looked around.  What had
185 become of the Bard?

187 P.S. Thanks, MIKEY.  It's good to have it back.
188 P.P.S. As the ONLY time I go downtown is to attend the PorSFiS meetings
189 every other Saturday, I may have some difficulty accurately portraying
190 the environment and inhabitants of said metropolis.  Well, shift imagination

194    The air was saturated.  The piper took shelter under an overhanging building
195 and waited for the downpour to moderate.  He wanted -- oh how he wanted!!--
196 to leave this reality, but could not bring himself to abandon his compainions.
197   Oh well, perhaps just a tune to lift his spirits -- and maybe ---
198 He lifted the pipes to his shoulder, oblivious to the people hurrying by.  
199 Taking a deep breath, he inflated the pipes, set the drones humming and
200 began fingering the chanter.  With his dancing fingers, he wove the feeling
201 of the cool mists winding through secret glens high in the misty hills.  He
202 played the droplets of mist condensing out of the air onto the leaves, dropping
203 down and joining their fellows, first a trickle, then a brook, a stream, a
204 mighty river.  A tinkle of coins caught his attention.  The pavement before
205 him had several coins.  He had gathered quite a crowd.  He swung into a 
206 strathspey -- the lively beat swinging out through the crowd -- there --
207 a lady was breaking into a dance.  It was not an uncommon occurance -- he
208 tried to reach with the notes and cause her steps to bounce -- to lift her
209 with the music.  Noticing that she was tiring, the piper took the next phrase
210 rather slowly and snapped off the sound of the pipes.  A shower of coins 
211 hit the pavement and he bent to collect them.  He straightened up and became
212 aware of her level gaze.  It was a cold and heartless town, he was sure --
213 but with a native guide --
214 -----
215    Later that evening, the piper was playing in a small tavern.  He had just
216 finished a set of tunes when he heard the shout --
217 "-AD TO SEE YOU!"  A familiar voice --
218 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

227 A KILT WAS UNDER THE OVERHANG OF THE PARKING STRUCTURE, PLAYING AWAY.  HIS
228 EYES WERE CLOSED, AND HE DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT THE OCCASIONAL COIN THAT
229 PEOPLE THREW HIM.  THEN HE OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AT ME AND STARTED PLAYING
230 AND THE MUSIC MADE ME DANCE.  HE PICKED UP THE COINS AFTERWARD, BUT I COULDN'T
231 LEAVE.  I TALKED  WITH HIM AND TOOK HIM BACK HOME WITH ME.  I COULD TELL THAT
232 THE CARS AND CITY BOTHERED HIM.  I ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS FROM AND HE SAID
233 SOME WEIRD PLACE CALLED INNISFALL-- I NEVER HEARD OF IT.  HE TOLD ME ABOUT IT
234 AND I TOLD HIM I REALLY WANTED TO GO THERE.  WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS
235 FOR A LONG TIME.  I FED HIM DINNER AND TOOK HIM DOWN TO A TAVERN I LIKED.  HE
236 PLAYED HIS PIPES AND I DANCED A LITTLE.  THEN AS HE STOPPED THIS WEIRD GUY
237 CAME YELLING UP.  I HELD ONTO HIS ARM BUT HE SEEMED GLAD TO SEE THE WIERD GUY

247 """HAY MAN,WANNA BUY SOME GOOD DRUGS???"
248 the one dressed in gray wondered about what "drugs" were,people kept offering
249 to sell him some.perhaps they were native food of some kind? deciding to try it
250 he put on his best gravely voice and yelled"yes,I do want some drugs"
251 this seemed to cause some consternation amongst the crowd,they all moved away,
252 strange,maybe "drugs" were only ment for women?
253 "hey dude,not so loud" oh good,I found a "drug" salesman.
254 "whatcha need? acid,good dope,hash,oil,even got some good crank!"
255 ah,something nurishing perhaps?
256 "nurishing? oh well,I guess hash is nurishing enough,here I gotta gram,you got
257 15 bucks" oh,money,local money,he he,perhaps you could tell me where I can have
258 this changed? the ssalesmans eyes lit up in an uncharicteristic look"gold,sure,
259 thats good here!!" oh fine,how many do you need? "1 will b fine,just fine,here 
260 have it all" and he thrust a rather largeish bag of "hash" into my hands and qu
261 ickly left.extreamly pecular taste,now to find the local tavern.....

275 "Right.... Of all the LOUSY lines to wind up on", said the bard as he 
276 consulted a odd-looking box, "Europo-American Subsector, 20th century C.E....
277 OH NO! Not the Reagan line! ARRGH!"
278 Voyeur gave him a puzzled look, "What does all that mean?"@
279 "It means we don't want to hang around very long, most of this group
280 of timelines get REAL ugly in a few years." He thought for awhile. "OK, let's
281 see what we can put together in the way of gear and funds."
282 It wasn't until then that he realized that most of the group had left.
283 "Great, just WONDERFUL! I turn my back for a minute and everbody takes off.
284 Now we're gonna have to track them down before something happens to them."
285 "Aside from the 'cars' and 'buses', what do they have to worry about?" someone
286 asked. "I mean, this place DOES look civilized- well sort of..."
287 "Tell me my friend, what do you suppose would happen to an OBVIOUS
288 foriegner, apparently alone and NOT a noble or the like if he tried wandering
289 around the thieves' quarter of one of the eastern cities?" He paused, "And then
290 of course, there's the fact that ONE gold piece is about a MONTH's wages here!
291 NOW do you see why I'm so worried?"
292 The bard thought to himself, "No way am I even going to TRY to explain
293 vagrancy & lack of ID!"
294 After some discussion bard decided that they'd better leave. No point
295 in attracting too much attention. (Though the way some of them were dressed...)
296 After a brief search for a gold dealer (you try finding one that's
297 open on Saturday!) to change some money, they were off.

359    #Bard -- I have no idea what this place is called.  I'll wait here.#
360    The piper was sitting in the back corner of the tavern at a table with
361 the mad actor.  His pipes were cradled in his left arm while his right held
362 a small pitcher of very weak and pale ale.  A young lady leaned on him and was
363 watching the proceedings quietly.
364   The piper poured the pale fluid into a glass and spoke.
365   "It's a strange place here.  I really don't know what happened to get us
366 to this reality, but I don't seem to have much strength for shifing us out
367 with the pipes."  He drank a deep daught from the glass.
368   "I suspect the fact that the bass drone is going out could cause the problem.
369 I'll put a new reed in, but it will take several hours of steady playing o
370 break in the reed.  It will take even longer to get it very controllable."
371   Reaching into his sporran, the piper pulled out a slim yellow cylinder a
372 about 5 inches long and 1/2 inch in diameter.  It was a piece of cane, topped
373 with a blob of red sealing wax, a tounge cut in one side, the lower end 
374 wrapped in hemp cord.  The piper placed this in his mouth and blew.  A loud
375 quaaark resulted.  The piper combed a hair from his beard and slid it up 
376 under the tounge of the reed, tried again and said, "It's not the best reed
377 I've ever tried, but it looks like it'll have to do."
378   He slid the drone out of the pipes, put in the new reed and reassembled the
379 pipes.  Standing up, he moved nearer the door.  As long as he was going to
380 have to break in the reed, the xsound might help attract the rest of the party.

384 (except for the few who were familar with high technology worlds), the
385 apprentice had to face this assualt on his senses without either of
386 these cructches. He was totally unfamiliar with any technological item more
387 complex than hand tools or an astrolabe. And worst of all, though he kept
388 trying to find the magic animating these devices, he could find none!
389 "No magic..., no magic... but there HAS to be some..."
390 Finally, he extended his perception to the limit.....
391 Was there something there? Off to the east, and perhaps a bit north?
392 There WAS some magic here! Small flickers scattered here and there,
393 and one MASSIVE source far off. It must be INCREDIBLY powerful for him to be
394 able to sense it from this distance!
395 He reached out once more... stones... megaliths... Of course! It was 
396 a henge, like those back home... 
397 At the thought of home, he felt a massive resonance from the henge.
398 It might be a way home! But it felt as if it were at least a score and a half
399 leagues distant. Well, first he had to find the others..
400 At least now he was used to this world....

402 To: All
403 I am considering submitting our current adventure to Pulsar
404 (the PorSFiS newsletter). Does anyone have any objections?
405 Bard and I wish to beg thy pardon for the rather lengthy business
406 portion of the meeting. It was the most business conducted in the last 
407 six months!

411 This is Gary and I'm in need of some help; since thing appr
412 rather slow it seemed a good time to ask.
413 
414 I've mentioned before that I'm a mental health professional. The
415 problem is that there have generally been about a hundred and 
416 fifty applications for every mental health position that opens.
417 I've been unemployed now since nearly a year ag
418 completed the "Nuts To You" series. It's getting real old.
419 
420 I'm interested in developing some marketalble computer 
421 related skills so I can broaden my job search. I know many 
422 of you know a great deal about what's happening with computers 
423 in the area. I'm hoping you'll have some advice to offer.
424 
425 I'm very interested in learning how to do research on the 
426 big databases like Dialog, Orbit, MIST, etc. I've been reading 
427 about them but have no hands-on experience.
428 
429 My questions. What is the job situation for telecomputing in 
430 Portland? How much training does it require? Who offers
431 best training? Is there a local telecomputing users group and 
432 how to I get in touch with them?
433 The other area I'm looking into is technical writing. I don't 
434 have formal training in this area but over the years I've 
435 developed an easy to read style. With the obvious need for 
436 easy to understand computer information I figure this skill 
437 must be marketable.
438 My questons? Who hires unproven techical writers? Would formal 
439 training help in getting a job? What training? Where? What is 
440 the best way to break into the field?
441 I've always been impressed with the intelligence, knowledge, 
442 and sophistication of most of the patrons of the Inn. I figure 
443 if ever there was a place I could get an intelligent answer to 
444 my questions this is it. I'm looking forward to your responses.

448     I was rapidly growing tired of this reality.  At least before, I was
449 able to keep track of the others.  And me with no coin of the realm, that
450 surely dosent happen very often....  Wait, a few coin's here and there.
451 Nothing from around here, but maybe something a collector would want.
452     No, Nothing of interest.  Hmmm, at least not to an expert. I figured
453 it was about time to put my salesmanship talents to work.
454   @@@@@@@@@@@@@
455 Within hours I had sold several small coins, an extra set of boots, and
456 something called a Ross Island Bridge.  Now I could spend time looking for
457 whoever else might have entered this time shift.  
458       soon it was starting to get dark, and I needed a place to eat, not to
459 mention a place to sleep.   Wait, I hear something up in the distance, could
460 it be pipes?  Not knowing many many pipers in my time, I decided to follow
461 the sound.
462      What's that up ahead, a tavern?   I chuckled to myself. I should have
463 known.  Entering, I waved to the barkeep for something to make me
464 forget my aching feet.  I looked over.  Not only was the piper here, but
465 the actor as well.  I walked over, bowed formally, and sat.

470 THE SPINNER HAD BEEN OF NO HELP. HE PRATTLED ABOUT THIS AND THAT BUT WHEN
471 I HAD PRESSED HIM FOR HELP OR INFORMATION ON MY WHEREABOUTS HE REMAINED
472 SHUT MOUTHED AND STIFF LIPPED. I MADE SURE WHEN I LEFT HE HAD FAT LIP.
473 THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO WAS HIT THE ROAD AND LOOK FOR A TRANSUNIVERSAL
474 REALITY OFFICE. IT LOOKED LIKE A LONG REALITY SHIFT. THE ONLY CLUE THAT 
475 I GLEANED FROM THE SPINNER HAD BEEN THAT THE "INN" AND THE FOLK WHO WERE
476 FREQUENTLY SEEN THERE MIGHT BE OF HELP. UNFORTUNATELY, IT APPEARED THAT
477 IN THIS, I WAS ALSO ON MY OWN. THEY HAD BEEN THERE BUT HAD SHIFTED REALITY
478 BUT A SHORT TIME PRIOR TO MY ARRIVAL. I NOTICED A POLE SET INTO THE SIDE
479 OF THE ROAD, SIGNS POINTING THIS WAY AND THAT. ONE SAID REALITY 1980'S.
480 WELL, I THOUGHT, TAKE A CHANCE! YOU CAN GET LOST BUT YOU CAN'T GO HOME.

503   As I drive out of the car lot I check out the handleing of the small car.
504 Reality travel has its benefits, somthing picked up for practically nothing
505 in one reality can be extremly valuble in another. A couple of my diamonds
506 had gotten me a car and a few hundred dollars of cash. There are a few places
507 in this culture where things can be sold or bought without questions.
508   As I drive towards the Tavern near the river I come apon a rather bewildered
509 looking Apprentice walking along the sidewalk (not completely by chance).
510 I have a rather difficult time explaining cars to him...

534 The Poet was enjoying this reality more and more. At first he assumed that
535 such an "advanced" culture would not take his cash, but when he cautiously
536 approached the barman with a coin it was accepted with astonishing greed.
537 Apparently gold was a rather rarer commodity here than in Innisfall. Now,
538 with only two coins gone from his purse, he found himself with a bar tab 
539 paid for some time in advance and the in the company of an attractive (if
540 rather overly top-heavy) young lady. I could get used to this, he thought
541 to himself, even if the ale is so thin I have to drink twice as much of it.
542 A contented smile played across his lips and his toe tapped to the Piper's
543 tune as he surveyed the room from above his fourteen empty glasses.

560 The piper looked around at the growing group.  "We are almost back together--
561 just a few left to go!"  He walked over to the door of the tavern and stood
562 outside on the sidewalk.  "Now if I can just keep from being arrested --"
