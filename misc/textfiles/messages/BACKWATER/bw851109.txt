27 A DAY IN THE LIFE- LAST WEEK I DISCOVERED THAT WE ARE SHARING OUR HOUSE
28 WITH MEESES. I WAS ON MY WAY TO RAID THE KITCHEN AND THERE THEY WERE ON
29 THE FLOOR, JUST STARING AT ME. WELL, I DON'T KNOW AOUT YOU, BUT I'D JUST
30 AS SOON NOT HAVE MEESES. APPARENTLY THEY HAD THE SAME IDEA AS I, FORAGING
31 FOR FOOD. I IMMEDIATELY ORDERED THEM TO PACK UP ANDGET OUT, BUT THE LITTLE
32 BUGGERS JUST TWITCHED THEIR LITTLE NOSES AT ME, AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND
33 THE STOVE, NARROWLY AVERTING THE JAR OF ADAMS NATURAL (CRUNCHY) PEANUT
34 BUTTER I THREW AT THEM. WELL, MICE LIKE PEANUT BUTTER, SO THIS IS NOT A
35 GOOD WAY TO GET RID OF THEM. 
36    THAT NIGHT BEFORE I WENT TO SLEEP, I PLOTTED AGAINST THEM. NEXT DAY
37 I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT MOUSE TRAPS. GARDEN VARIETY 69 CENT WOOLWORTHS MOUSE
38 TRAPS. THREE DAYS, SEVERAL STUNG FINGERS AND FOUR AND A HALF POUNDS OF
39 TILLAMOOK LATER, I REALIZED THIS WOULDN'T WORK. MEESES ARE WISE TO THIS
40 OLD TRICK. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THEY MADE A CATAPULT FROM ONE OF THEM, AND
41 WHEN I'D GO TO THE KITCHEN DURING A LATE NIGHT MUNCHIES ATTACK, THEY'D
42 START LOBBING OLIVES AT ME. VERY OLD OLIVES THEY FOUND UNDER THE FRIJ.
43 YUCK. SO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. MICE, I REASONED, ARE AFRAID OF CATS
44 RIGHT? SO, I'D GET A CAT. WELL..., CATS ARE LIKE COPS. YOU NEVER CAN FIND
45 ONE WHEN YOU NEED THEM. NOW THERE MUST BE A FEW STRAYS AROUND, SO I DECIDED
46 TO GO LOOKING FOR ONE. AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR, I STARTED THINKING, I PROBABLY
47 SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT THE DOG. WELL, BY THE TIME I GOT BACK HOME, I WAS
48 BURNED OUT ON THAT IDEA.
49 WE HAVE THESE NEIGHBORS WHO HAVE A CAT, BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T SEE MY SELF
50 GOING OVER THERE AND SAYING, HI!, UM, COULD I BORROW YOUR CAT...
51 THERE ARE PLACES LISTED IN THE YELLOW PAGES THAT CLAIM TO RENT ANYTHING.
52 THEY LIE. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT SOME OF THEM WERE DOWNRIGHT RUDE.
53 ESPECIALLY THE GUY AT U-HAUL WHO APPARENTLY MISUNDERSTOOD ME.
54 THE PHONE NUMBER HE GAVE ME WAS FOR AN ALL NIGHT BOOK STORE AND MASSAGE
55 PARLOR. BY THEN, I WAS TOO BEAT TO CONTINUE, SO I CRASHED, AND DREAMED
56 ABOUT KANGAROOS AND SATURDAY MORNING CARTOON SHOWS.DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY
57 SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO GET RID OF MEESES?
58 ---Suggest you simply turn on all your old television sets, specifically to
59 the Pete-and-Now-Tracy Show, On the Spot Hype, any noon-time local drivel,
60 the violence and treachery of the K2 network, and Portland Rasslin'.  With
61 their rodent IQs, said meeses will hop the Lite Trail to settle into the
62 stacks of the county library.  PS. Try vacuuming twice a year; even your
63 landlord/mortgagor will appreciate that!		Ex-rodentia

91 The dragon advanced toward the Bear. The Bear was now the dragon's prey, and 
92 it was in no hurry to end Bear's worried agony. It made its way toward Bear,
93 one step at a time. Its green eyes gleemed with passion: anger, hunger, 
94 revenge and pure evil all buried deep within. The long, red mouth drooled red 
95 goo, like lava. They made hissing sounds as they hit the ground.
96 
97 The Bear backed away, just as slowly. Suddenly his back hit the craggy wall.
98 He gasped for breath, every muscle in his body, every pore of skin screaming
99 for relief from the pain. He coughed slightly, it hurt his chest to do so.
100 
101 He examined his sword, still embedded in the dragon's chest. Black-red blood
102 oozed out around it, dropping beneath the dragon and mingling with the searing
103 hot spittle that already lay there from its drooling mouth.
104 
105 He looked at the monstrous teeth and the huge, sharp claws- both mighty
106 weapons which would impede his path toward grabbing the sword from the 
107 serpent's underside.
108 
109 His head buzzed with plans. He thought of--- suddenly! Before his mind could
110 turn one more plan over- the dragon was upon him. It leaped with a fierce
111 energy Bear hadn't counted on. It's gaping, blood-red mouth opened before him
112 as the dragon pounced. Bear froze in that split second of an instant, and the
113 dragon was upon him!
114 
115 Bear was crushed against the wall as the dragon's mouth hit him full force. He
116 could only scream as it wrapped its lip s over his body and picked him up.
117 
118 The dragon shook the helpless Bear like a dog shakes a rag- back and forth in
119 ferocious hatred. It opened its mouth slightly and shook its head one more
120 time, and Bear sailed across the large cavern and smashed against the far
121 wall. He lay in a heap, and growned. With every ounce of reserve energy he 
122 could muster, he stood, propping himself against the wall. He gasped for
123 breath, and stared at the dragon between squinted eyelids. He wiped his brow
124 of the trickling blood, and faced his enemy with defiance in his near-closed
125 eyes.
126 
127 And the dragon drew closer, an evil smile seemingly gracing the ends of his
128 mouth. And he coiled his legs beneath him, and lept at Bear once again....

143 On the French Toast/Pen Name question: perhaps a mediating influence is needed
144 ? Let's just say that true, PN, the media is full of misinformation. Many
145 reports are given from the simple result of one conversation (rumor), and 
146 facts are often distorted to fit the case.  HOWEVER,
147 French Toast and anyone else must gather whatever information they can, weed
148 out the bad, and read between the lines to gleen what is the truth. To crit-
149 icize someone for that and put on a holier-than-thou act is as misinformative 
150 as those terrible people you see in the media. And before you tart blaring 
151 your horn about this and that, how 'bout a solution. I love people who display
152 their knowledge about the ills of society but have no cure.
153 And if you're in the journalistic field (and get paid for it), I'm a horned
154 owl's poo-poo.

156 AIDS is a killer, it will spread into the heterosexual community soon like
157 you  won't believe, and will quickly be the no. 1 topic on this country's
158 mind. Only time will prove me right... and it's the gays fault for tampering 
159 with nature... and I wish it didn't have to be this way. But perhaps it is
160 best, and our long-forgotten Maker is simply reminding us that he wants us
161 to be faithful to ONE person.
162 
163 You'll see!
164 
165 (*) (*), etc.
166 
167 >>>  Excuse me above, let me correct you.  It will spread to the maler 
168 homosexua;ll community.  Gay women run less of a risk of getting it than
169 a married women does.  (Unless, of course, they are bisexual or are
170 with someone who is).  Isn't it strange how people here have talked
171 about t"those gays" as if the men and women were the same.  But, in
172 fact (I doubt you know any) they are very different in behavior. 
173 So, I thought it needed correction.  As for nature, well... I can not
174 talk of gay men, fo I kmow few.  I do know gay women who have been
175 raped or molesteded when they were children and now thwey do not choose
176 to go out with men.  After that kind of suffering, I think it quite
177 within the bounds of human nature to be gay.  I don't think it the 
178 least bit queer or something to be shunned as perhaps you do.  The
179 pains of little girl will follow her through out her entire life.
180 Bah!  Enough of this seriousness.  What has it to do with AIDS?  
181 Now I ask you to excuse me for dribbling on like this.  <<<
182 Oops!  I read you wrong.  Please cut out the second sentence.  The next
183 few references following may be off, but once you get to human nature,
184 that still applies.  After all, it's only a reaction to human nature.  <<<

208 To: >>> above (could you sign a name of some sort, it is hard to indicate
209 who you are trying to respond to without a name.)
210      I agree in your reference to human nature. It is not unnatural for
211 one human being to love another. Male/female aspects have nothing to do 
212 with love. Male/female relationships are built from natures patterns, but
213 as with all natural things, it is easily modified or overriden by other
214 input, possibly internal natural input in some cases, (no one really knows
215 for sure) and definately as a result of external enviornmetal trauma.
216 But to say that it is wrong for someone to enjoy the company and favors 
217 of another just because they happen to be the same sex is a bit much for
218 me to accept. I do not hate gays, I do not love them, they are simply
219 human beings like anyone else, and deserve to be treated as human beings.
220      As for AIDS, it is not just male homosexuals that are in danger of
221 contacting AIDS, any group that has for one reason or another exposure to
222 the body fluids of someone who has AIDS is at increased risk. The reason
223 why there is a greater danger among the African tribes where it has been 
224 supposedly traced is because it is common practice for them to chew a
225 baby's food for it. They don't have the convenence of baby food there,
226 so they must make do with what they can. And thus the transference of
227 AIDS through the saliva mixed with the food causes a much higher risk
228 than in more 'advanced' countries. 
229      The reason male gays are at such high risk is only because of their
230 sexual practices, alowing sperm fluids that might contain the AIDS virus 
231 to gain access to the partners blood stream through a tear in the anal
232 passage. Anyone who engages in practices which allows body fluids to mix 
233 is in some danger of transferring the desease. This includes 'straight' 
234 sex since kissing is a rather common associated aspect, and this 
235 certainly allows transference of body fluids. But, the most assured 
236 and almost gaurenteed means of transfer is through direct large infusion
237 of one persons body fluid into anothers most particularly if it is blood,
238 or closly derived from blood. The reason why it is so difficult to 
239 detect and control AIDS, is because it works through the T4 white blood
240 cell. The very cell that is a basic part of the immune system. And, it
241 can lay dormant for years before making itself known. Detection of AIDS
242 currently is only possible when it becomes active in the body and the
243 body tries to combat it with the immune system, but since the desease itself
244 prays on that very immune system, it is all too often a losing battle.
245 There are people who have survived AIDS, but it is not good odds once it
246 has gotten a major foot hold. Sort of like cancer in that aspect.
247      No, french toast, we should not be running around in circles screaming
248 and shouting as you seem to intimidate, we should be earnestly trying to find
249 the mechanisims of the desease, and work towards finding a way to combat it.
250 This includes being realistic about the methods and means of the transfer
251 of AIDS from one person to another. The means of movement of AIDS has been
252 determined, even the makeup if the virus involved is now known, it is
253 simply a matter of determining how to properly detect and combat it before
254 it gets a major foothold on the individual. This is how you combat a 
255 desease, not by running around screaming and hollering and creating unneeded
256 and unwarrented panic in the streets as the popular media have done.
257 Education and understanding is what brought hepatitus under control, not
258 panic. The same will be true of AIDS.

261 Bravo fred, you typed calmly and apparantly knowledgably.
262 I particurly agreed with your comment about education and understanding.
263 It's a shame that when an unknown or other 'crisis' occurs in
264 our ever widening community that more people don't react in
265 such a rational manner.

344    Technically, they weren't exactly lost. They just didn't know where they were. The difference was that James knew
345 of a central reference point that he could reach from any other point in the universe. They could leave at any time
346 using the same method that he had used to escape the dimensional prison. The only problem was that James claimed he
347 was too wiped out at the moment to attempt to open a warpgate. He needed a few days rest, first. Which left them stuck
348 without any supplies on an unknown and possibly dangerous planet.
349    They walked along the beach until the second sun was low in the sky. Then they came upon a wide path that led deep
350 into the forest. The path was well cleared and obviously not made by animals (They would have called it man-made but
351 there was no positive proof yet that humans inhabited this world.). However, the path probably led to civilization and
352 hopefully benign beings who could shelter them for a few days.
353    By the time the sound of the ocean faded behind them it was almost full dark and they both began to feel like
354 walking zombies. Hardly surprising, when they realized that it had been at least thirty hours since either had slept.
355 Once the excitement and human drama and accompanying adrenalin flow had faded, they realized how tired they were.
356 James said it was time to call a halt to the march and find somewhere to settle for the night. Tariya wasn't too
357 enthused about the idea of sleeping outside in the middle of the woods but admittedly there was little choice in the
358 matter.
359    There were many clearings on either side of the path so they stopped at the next one that presented itself. James
360 said he would stand first watch but Tariya said that wasn't neccesary. She set up a series of mystic guards around the
361 area. If anything even slightly dangerous tried to intrude on them the guards would raise all kinds of pyrotechnical
362 and acoustical hell and if that didn't scare off the threat at least the travellers would be awake and alert to deal
363 with it. James was impressed, not to say a bit surprised, that she could accomplish this, but thought it best not to
364 say so. Privately he had thought her rather inept at her chosen craft.
365    They found a soft spot underneath what appeared to be an oak tree and settle down within an arm's length of each
366 other and Tariya was out within seconds. James took quite a while to fall asleep but then he always did, these
367 days.
368    His sleep was uneasy and restless as the hurts and fears that he normally kept subliminated during his waking life
369 returned to haunt him with a vengence, as usual. He jolted awake completely at one point, when he felt an unaccustomed
370 pressure on his side. It took a momet before he realized it was Tariya, who had snuggled up against him. She was still
371 out like a light, and probably didn't even know she had done it. James smiled and put an arm around her. She moved a
372 little and settled down, apparently quite comfortable. He closed his eyes and went back to sleep.
373    And for the first time in a long, long time, the nightmares didn't come back.

422 John Silverman:
423 
424 I'm an old Backwater regular who's been too busy to contribute
425 much for the past year or so. I still scan what's happening
426 at the Inn fairly regularly and I noticed your work. It's good.
427 
428 You asked about Frank.
429 
430 Frank was a Backwater character created by a mental health
431 professional who used to frequent this system. No one at the
432 time knew Frank was only a character. They thought he was for
433 real.
434 
435 Frank presented himself as a pedophile. He stated that he
436 preferred sex with young boys and that he was being persecuted
437 for his lifestyle choice.
438 
439 You can imagine the result.
440 
441 The patrons of the Inn were outraged. They began with a lot
442 angry name calling but soon settled down and attempted to
443 deal with Frank on an intellectual level. This, apparently,
444 was what Frank was waiting for.
445 
446 Frank was a composite of the rationalizations, justifications,
447 and denials a real perpetrator might
448 intentionally jab at peoples most tender taboos, getting
449 them totally outraged, then challenge them to discuss their
450 feelings rationally.
451 
452 It was more than the Backwater regulars could resist. 
453 plunged into battle.
454 
455 They attacked Frank and his behavior with some of the most
456 thoughtful writing I've ever seen around here. They soon
457 discovered to their apparent surprise that ol' Frank was a
458 bit smarter than they would have expected. 
459 
460 This is hardly surprising. After all, Frank's creator has a
461 Masters Degree in Counseling and experience with the real
462 Franks of the world. It's not surprising he could put up a
463 realistic fight.
464 
465 Since Frank had no emotional investment in the battle he was
466 free from their barbs. He could approach the conflict an
467 emotional detachment the others couldn't match. I think it
468 gave Frank something of an edge.
469 
470 It was an interesting confrontation to observe. It's
471 unfortunate you missed it.
472 
473 Anyway, I hope that gives you a better understanding about
474 what the Frank thing was all about.
475 
476 Frank was basically the unbridled whimsy of a mental health
477 professional with an over active imagination and a penchant
478 for mischief.
479 
480 That's all their was to it.

486 
487 Oh I'm sick of all this AIDS blather, but I have to throw my thoughts in one more time because it's one a subject
488 *everyone* ignores.
489 
490 Okay, think about it. We've lived with V.D. for years. It was a scary thing, but once science got a cure for it, it became
491 simply a nuisance. Now, in the last 20 years, sex with partners other than one's spouse has skyrocketed. Suddenly it's
492 *acceptable* to have sex with whomever and whenever you like. The sexual revolution and all that jazz.
493 Now, contrary to the people who say "God made gays so he loves them and thinks anything they do is just fine," it is
494 stated over and over again in the Bible that not only is homosexuality a *sin*- but so is just plain ordinary sex with some-
495 one who is not your spouse!
496 So! Suddenly there appears a disease, during the middle of this sexual revolution which everyone is now so accepting of
497 and willing to "live and let live," a disease called Herpes. Some media hype, etc. creates a few scares... but it's
498 (suspiciously) incurable, and just as suspiciously, it's forever!
499 Okay, dum-dums, getting the hint yet? You fool around, and you'll bear a *mark* forever! Worth the risk? (God is big on marks
500 remember).
501 And the humans said (most of 'em anyway): "Naw, I probably won't get it. Besides... it's just an inconvenience. I won't *die*
502 from it for God's sake!" (More his sake then they know).
503 
504 So! One last time. Okay fine. How about a disease which you can't cure, can't even discover, is highly contagious with
505 the right kind of contact and you'll probably *die* from it!
506 
507 Get the message yet? Are human begins so wrapped up in science, sensory feelings and the busy-ness of this world that
508 they (1) forget about God, (2) ignore a blatant message from same, and (3) are so brain-washed from the occurances of the 
509 last 20 years that they dismiss such messages as "natural" things? Do you really think this is nature simply saying, "hey, 
510 it's ok  for dogs and cats to screw around, but people- no, I want them to be faithful, so I'll create a new disease?"
511 NO! God exists! And why not a new plague? Don't you thinthe stench of wanton sex disgusts him? And before someone says "how
512 do you know what God thinks?"- read the Bible! Sodom and Gomorrah (Sodom- y... remember?)- why do you think he flooded
513 the world? With that evidence past, why is the fact that one more disease, which only kills those who allow themselves to be
514 exposed to it (the blood transfusions are an unfortunate side-effect I suppose) seem so preposterous in comparison? Because 
515 we're *modern!?@
516 Open your eyes people! Sure it came first through gays, but the heterosexual  community will soon be ravaged as well!
517 The message is... stay with one partner! You also have to remember even divorce is hated by God! Read his own words!
518 
519 Ah, well, I'm not a preacher. It just seems so *obvious* to me it's unbelievable how unspirited a people can become in
520 such a short time. Just because you can't see things, doesn't mean they don't exist. And God may have made gays, but he sure
521 as hell, yes, sure as there is hell, he despises what they  *do*, he still loves them, but despises their actions. Read the 
522 Book, he spells it out in black and white. We're so accepting of wrong and immorality nowadays that people don't feel
523 wrong when they do it.
524 
525 Okay someone elses turn.Sorry to blather on, but *someone*  has to remind you.

529 PEOLPE IN AMERICA TAKE FOR GRANTED THE FREEDOM TO COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE.
530 WHAT THEY NEED IS A SUBTLE REMINDER THAT THERE ARE PLACES IN THIS WORLD WHERE
531 THERE ARE NO SUCH RIGHTS. WHAT WE SHOULD DO WOULD BE TO LEVY A TEN PERCENT TAX
532 ON WELFARE, UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION, ADC, AND WORKERS COMPENSATION. 
533 THIS MONEY WOULD BE USED TO HIRE SQUADS OF RUSSIAN INFANTRY TO COME HERE AND
534 KILL ALL THE KITTENS AND PUPPIES THAT BELONG TO ALL THE LITTLE KIDDIES. A SUBTLE REMINDER THAT
535 BIG IVAN IS WATCHING.

537 huh? Can anyone else make any sense out of what the person above just said?

539 
540 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
541 Isn't it interesting how when a desease
542 like cancer strikes, it is just another
543 desease, but when it is a desease like
544 herpies, or AIDS, all the sudden it is
545 God's vengence on a group of people
546 the pulpit pounder dislikes. You speak
547 of how nasty it is that someone would
548 love someone else who is of the same
549 sex, and using a desease as the basis
550 for justification of that hatred. As 
551 fred stated elsewhere, AIDS got its
552 start in Africa, and not as the result
553 of anal intercourse. It just happens
554 that thatis one of the easer routes
555 for the desease to gain access to 
556 another person, but it is not the only
557 means of spreading the desease. As
558 for herpies, that can spread just as
559 easyly thru married coupls as non.
560 Besides, I aint too keen on a god that
561 kills off a bunch of kids just because
562 they made fun of one of his followers.
563 That doesn't sound klike a kind 
564 compasionite loving person you make him
565 out to be (besides, who says god has
566 to be a man!). I'll stick to my own
567 veiw of god thank you, not the vengful
568 hateful entiy that you proport god to
569 be.

573      What!  You mean Frank was just a figment of someone's imagination?
574      Yee Gods!  I think I've been hoodwinked.... but then that's not hard
575      to do.

583 Andy:	Not a preacher, eh?  Maybe you should look into it, a *real* future.
584        	But, if'n you don't mind, I quabble with your view of realities.  
585 		In my reality, there is no place for somthing or someone of a 
586 	divine nature.  There is simply no place for a creator to exsist.  The
587 	thought of such is completely preposterous.  
588 		The Bible the truth??  Hardly.  Perhaps another 'Canturbury
589 	tales' or another 'Book of Nine Legonds' but not truth.
590 		Reality is what you make it, everyones' is different.
591                 (of course, then, no one is wrong!)

602 It never fails to amaze and not amuse me how (1) people defer to a
603 document of suspect origin that they KNOW has been 'translated'
604 hundreds of years ago to reflect one mans goals and that generation's
605 beliefs (the King James version) aswhen presenting their view, as opposed
606 using the products of their own mindsand (2) those same people can see
607 one aspect of an issue as a crystal-clear sign from God (particularly
608 if the event occurs within a 'minority,) while another aspect of the
609 very same issue (the innocent people - and their families - who have
610 been victimized through transfusion) is completely dismissed with no
611 message perceived, 'an unfortunate side-effect, I suppose' s/he said
612 blithely about people's LIVES|||| Whoops am getting a bit emotional
613 there. The main point I'm trying to make anyway is that I would much
614 prefer that people would apply their own rational MINDS to an issue,
615 think clearly, and tell me their considered opinion than throw me yet
616 another translation of the bible.
