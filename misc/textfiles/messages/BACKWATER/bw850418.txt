27 I am a child, staring for hours in fasination at an open book, then suddenly
28 discovering there are other pages to turn to.  It is frightening to feel the
29 awakening of something alien inside ones own body.  To think that there is a
30 part of you that is a stranger, dark and with a taste of evil power.  I have
31 looked inside my self and seen many things, but never this face behind a face.
32 
33 This is no face of a fool, a harlequin.  With huge twisted hands the form 
34 reaches above my head, feeling for the strings that make me what I am.  Fear
35 grows in my face, a feeling of helplessness.  The strings are my prison, but 
36 also my life.  They are my chains, and my wings.
37 
38 The stranger wears my body like a ragged suit, pushing his arms into mine like
39 they were some empty sleeve, waiting to be filled.  I can feel his power.  It
40 is a power I fear, for it has the scent of a beast.  Wild and uncontrolled.
41 His fingers fill the glove that is my hand and he grips the strings and with 
42 an inhuman scream rips them from my body.  I feel the waves of pain as my flesh
43 tears where the cords had worked themselves deep into my bones.  And my head
44 explodes as he pulls the one from deep inside my brain.
45 
46 I wait to feel the impact as I hit the floor, the support which held me gone.
47 My eyes closed against the pain and the thought of imagined death.  It does
48 not happen.  I open my eyes.  I see the strings hanging in the air around me,
49 still swinging from the violence of what has happened.  Inside me I feel the 
50 beast, standing firm, feet wide apart, holding me erect.  How did I wake this
51 thing inside me, and what is the price of my freedom?

58 	It was a cool dark stormy night and he was out of vasilene.  What 
59 could he do.  The winds were to strong this time of year on Venus.  Suddenly
60 an unexpected knock came at the door.  It was that lovely Earthling,Joane,
61 that just moved into his living complex.
62 	Joane was about 5'9'' and about 137lbs.  She had that special look
63 that only Venisian women could muster.  At least that is what he thougt until
64 now.  She wanted something.

83 Elax watched himself reflected in this endless expance of water.  He could
84 not understand why he he felt this way, nor how he got here.
85 Just a few days ago he had been known as Zermy to all his friends.  Now he
86 had no friends.  His immage was the same as it had always been but... There
87 was something about it that was just wrong.  He felt different too, there was
88 a mean streak in him which he was not used to feeling.  The only thing he was
89 sure about was that he had to do something about it all.  Every which way
90 he looked was watter.  Not a wave, not a ship, not an island to be seen for
91 miles around.  He tried to think back on the last few days... Maybe there
92 would be a clue for him there...  The only thing that came to mind was that
93 he would probably never see his friends again.  Then he remembered his sister
94 and the spider...

98 Is there anybody out there?
99 ---------------MM
100 I'm out here!
101 I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
102   The door of the INN was thrown wide and a smiling face thrust itself into
103 the room.  He looked about the place with an expression that stood somewhere
104 between wonder and glee, like the face of a child on christmas.  Though it
105 was still raining softly outside the hood of his cloak was thrown back.  The
106 rain had soaked his hair.  It was plastered to his head and small rivlets ran
107 down his face and neck.  Several of these stopped at the top of his gaping
108 smile.  He stepped into the room and small puddles began to form on the floor
109 at his feet.  Hearing the sound of the dripping he looked down, and with an
110 even more sheepish grin he hung his cloak next to the door.  
111   He stands just a bit over five and a half feet.  His clothes would look 
112 foolish on anyone else, but he wears them with an air of comfort that speaks
113 more loudly than first appearance.  The sleeves of his shirt were puffed 
114 widely, then ended in wide cuffs.  His pants were a patchwork of pockets,
115 some buttoned some tied closed.  The pants were pushed into the top of his 
116 boots, one black, one brown.  Over all this he wore a tunic of bright red,
117 belted with a small knife at the small of the back.
118   He picked his way toward the fire, excusing himself as he edged between the
119 crowd of chairs.  Upon reaching the fire he removed his boots and socks and
120 placed them on the hearth to dry.  Barefooted he found his way to the bar and
121 seated himself.  Quietly guesturing to the innkeeper, so as not to interupt
122 the buzz of conversation, he asks for a bit of ale and some cheese.  When it
123 arrives he takes a sip from the mug and impales the cheese on the blade of his
124 small knife, raises it to his mouth, and begins to eat.
125 I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

127 #In a cab again,# Farley thought.  #I really miss driving around with Fred.#
128 He didn't ponder on this for long, however; he noticed that Fellows, instead
129 of spouting his usual flood of wisecracks and puns, was being relatively 
130 silent, almost as if he knew something sinister and sobering, and it was 
131 occupying his mind.
132 Farley wasn't long in detecting his attack of shyness.  Thinking that if he
133 wanted to tell him about it, Fellows would, Farley decided not to push the
134 matter.
135 Several minutes later, the cab arrived before a rather nondescript pawn shop.
136 Farley couldn't help but notice the words "Henry's Second-Hand & Pawn Shop"
137 emblazoned upon the window in large yellow letters as he stepped out of the
138 cab.  L'homme paid the driver, and with a small grin at Farley's reaction, led
139 the way into the store.
140 Tinkle!  The bell above the door called to whoever was inside.

143      Not knowing it happened, dreamtoucher found himself, with snowrunner, out-
144 side the inn.  He had been telling person about/...?mmm  person?  were was 
145 person?  didn't seem to be around anyware.
146      Looking around Dreamtoucher realized he was near the roan tree.  (which
147 seemed to interest snowrunner anyway)
148 Through the foliage he could see someone entering the Inn.  An odd enough sight
149 itself in its own way.  He was more used to people just sort of showing up inside
150   if at all.  The last time he recalled anyone going in that way there had ben
151 trouble.  Speeking of trouble, Dreamtoucher felt a brooding presence that made
152 the gaurd hairs on his neck stand on end.  Holding walking stick in hand, he 
153 looked up into the branches of the tree.  Only breeze swept leaves were visible
154 but the feeling of emminent danger persisted.  Snowrunner's body language gave
155 eloquent evidance that the great white wolf sensed it as well.
156     Cautiosly, head and eyes in constant motion, they headed back toward the 
157 inn.

162      "How's that again, sir?" asked Kosta.
163      "I said, it's back on Tucker Road.  It's te only airfield we've got so you can't miss it," said Jannet's father.
164      "And you wouldn't, by chance, still have that aircraft lodged in the wings, would you?  It has been the source
165 of a few fond memories."  He had lied, but was trying to get a few more facts out of him.
166      "Yup, I've still got good old November Two-Niner sitting out there just waiting to be used.  I just might..."
167 His words were cut short by a quick chop to the back of the neck by Kosta's hand.  He had found what he was looking
168 for, and now it was time for him to depart to a more sunny environment.
169      "Lewis, what in the hell did you do that for?" came the plea from Jannet.
170 He hated to do it to them, but he knew that it was essential in accomplishing his goal.
171      "I shan't go into details for they are long and at this time unimportant.  What I will tell you is that I am being
172 followed by people that may call themselves my friends, and that they are trying to help me.  This is no longer true.
173 What I need is the use of your father's vehicles in order that I may return my life to some semblence of decency,
174 a shred of normality... if that is at all still possible."  While saying this, Kosta had been dragging Jannet's 
175 father over onto the sofa.  He then turned to Jannet.
176 "And now, if you would be so kind, I will be needing his set of keys.  Where are they?"
177      "No!  I won't do it!  I'm not going to help you," she said as she picked up the receiver to the telephone.  She
178 was going to try and call the authorities before any more foolishness would take place.  Kosta saw what she was
179 about to do and ponced across the room in an effort to stop her.  As he passed the sofa he lost his balance, causing 
180 him to collide against her body rather than just taking her by the arms to stop her.  They both dropped to the floor,
181 the receiver dangling from the table.
182      "Jannet, you don't understand.  These things I must do..."
183      "Have you lost you mind, Lewis?  What's gotten into you anyway?" she screamed.
184      "I must!  And stop calling me 'Lewis'.  He's long since been forgotten, and died from abandonment.  I am 'KOSTA' 
185 now, and shall go through with my plans.  Please do not attempt to stop me."  His grip of her was firm and Jannet knew
186 that whatever it was he had in mind, it was something she could not sway him from.
187      "The keys, Jannet.  I'll take them now..."
188 She just lay still for a moment, considering the possible alternatives.
189 
190           >>IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A CALL, PLEASE HANG UP AND TRY AGAIN.  IF YOU NEED HELP...<<

194         You had wings when first I met you, pinions as long and straight as the
195 path of a falling star, iridescent edges that caught the sun of the gardens
196 where I played and watched the ballet-flight of white on blue. We were a secret
197 to each other, never to be mentioned, always to be held close like a treasure
198 to the heart. Through the forever-time of spring the flicker of wings danced on
199 the edge of my perception, as much a part of me as hands or voice.
200         Then, at the end of the age of belief, our flight was cut short, torn
201 apart by the words that deny the existance of things unbelievable. The sunlight
202 left with the closing of wings, alabaster still and white, statue-cold.
203         In traveling the dark halls of time after, the memory remained under
204 the quiet surface, to be troubled only by some ribbon of music or the sigh of
205 wind through branches. I often wondered why the sight of white columns against
206 blue sky or the clouds at* night woke restlessness and the ghosts of unshed
207 tears. Sometimes I caught your shadow in a smile or the turn of a head and I
208 would feel the unbearable pull at my heart, a longing for nothing I could 
209 identify, and while I struggled for the answer it would vanish like the echo of
210 a long forgotten song.
211         The seasons of my life passed from the spring of promise and joy to the
212 long, hot summer that curled greeness to the sepia tones of old photographs,
213 crisp and dry as autumn leaves.
214         It is winter now, the end of the cycle, when the killing cold traces
215 feathery lace on the windowpanes and chills my flesh to the bone.  I wait as I
216 have waited before while te numbness steals motion and the white drifts blind
217 me.  But even in this end there is a beginning, for I hear the flicker,
218 feather-soft, of wings.
219                                                      Jannet Fields / 07 Mar 84
220                                       [better known to TIN people as "kml.)"]

223      As nightfall came, a dark figure could be seen getting out of an orange four-wheel drive pick-up truck.  (Jannet
224 always refered to it as her father's "sacred cow".)  He got out and made his way to the hangar and opened the lock 
225 with his recently aquired keys.  As he open the wide, squeeky doors he shrugged his shoulder to keep his pack from
226 falling off.  Before Kosta had left the house he had taken the liberty to borrow a few items he knew wouldn't be 
227 missed too dearly...  A fresh set of clothes from Jannet's brother that was out of town, a length of rope for 
228 general purposes, a pack for holding all else that he felt he would need, and of course the truck.
229 Not having flown an aircraft for some time, Kosta took his time running down a pre-flight inspection while checking
230 the procedures.  Since this was a private hangar, noone would question his unscheduled visit.  Or so he thought.  
231 After taxiing the craft to the service center for fueling he came upon an attendant that happened to know just who 
232 owned what, and who was authorized use of such property in these parts.
233      "Nice evenin', stranger," commented the station attendant.
234      "Yes, 'tis a superior night for flying.  I could not have asked for better weather conditions," responded Kosta.
235      "The news man said it was gonna rain."  The attendant had a wicked gleam in his eye.
236      "Say nothing of the kind!" said Kosta as he walked over to the man.  "Why, look at the clarity of the sky..." 
237 He placed his hand on the man's shoulder.  "It has never been so clear.  Do you not see, my friend?"
238 As the man looked to the horizon at which Kosta pointed, Kosta took his other arm and spun the man around -- locking
239 neck in between his arms.  With a swift twist the attendant lapsed from consciousness.  Another obstacle had been
240 overcome.  Quickly, Kosta finished the fueling by himself and was on his way down the airstrip...  ignoring all calls 
241 from the tower.  With a the wigns full of fuel, he would have at least four hours of uninterupted flying ahead of him
242 and a chance to learn how to fly all over again.  Casting aside the weight of the situation, he began to whistle a 
243 simple tune to lighten his spirits.              #Cal-i-fornia, here I come...#

246 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
247   The piper passed out of sight of the remains of the battle long before he
248 passed out of scent.  The odor of death followed him, dogging his footsteps
249 with relentless wafts of corruption and reminders of mortality.
250   When at last the fading reminders of the battle had dropped below the
251 piper's threshold of perception, he scarcely noticed it, trying to find a 
252 stream.  The large silver cup he carried was getting heavy, and he did not
253 relish the thought of carrying it back full.
254   The packed and torn tracks of the slaughtered armies gave way to grassy
255 paths -- the grass shortened by use but not completely worn from the road.
256 The piper's spirits lifted as he began to pace this track, heel-toe, heel-toe
257 quickly setting up a monotonous rhythm designed to cover the miles with a
258 minimum of effort.
259   When soon he came across a small stream, he dropped to the grassy verge and
260 immersed the cup, watching the clear fluid swirl over the brim.  His thirst
261 began to grow as he stood, the cool clear water dripping in runnels from the
262 metal so chill in his hands.  HLifting the cup, he was stopped short by a voice.
263   "Nay -- drink not!"
264   Lowering the cup, the piper turned to see the knight who first had sent him
265 on this errand, still mounted on the huge horse whose huge front hoof was 
266 pawing the ground.  Surprised, the piper found a vagrant corner of his mind
267 contmplating the horses' actions -- the hoof must be shoed with a cleated shoe,
268 his mind insisted, the quantity of earth is just too great for a plain shoe,
269 and see how the long hairs from the horse's ankle brushes and smooths the
270 dark soft earth its hoof mounds up.
271   "Drink not."  The knight repeated, holding his hand lower for the cup, the
272 movement accompanied by a familiar metallic clash.
273   The piper lifted the cup and put it into the knight's hand.  The armored
274 hand closed around the stem and the knight lifted it to his lips and
275 drank deeply.  After finishing his daught, the knight held the cup at arm's
276 length and began to pour.  Instead of the clear sparkling water the piper
277 had filled the cup with, thick runnels of congealing blood flowed from the
278 container to soak into the ground.

281 Elax was now getting desperate, there had to be a limit to how long he could
282 go on treading water like this.  It felt like days since he had last set his
283 foot on solid ground.  Thoughts were going through his head at a furious pace
284 "It has not been dark since I have been floating around" was the predominant
285 one, he knew something was wrong, when he first lost track of the solid ground
286 is was almost sun-set, now...  There was no sun anywhere, just a solid sheet
287 of bright light all above and around him, reaching way to the edges of the
288 water, and finaly touching it there.  Sjtreaching his legs to avoid cramps
289 Elax felt something touch his foot...

302 Elax looked deep into the water, holding his hands to block some of the light
303 reflecting off the surface.  There was something down there, his foot still
304 touched it, in fact he could feel it moving beneath him.  It was inching 
305 toward the surface and moving towards his right a bit.  As it lifted he gained
306 more of a footing, and begain to move with the thing.  He wasn't sure if this
307 was the bottom or not, the water could be carrying him, creating the illusion
308 of movement.  Whether it was he of the water that moved, he was beginning to
309 make quite a bit of a wake.  The water pushed against his side with a lot of
310 force, and he spread his feet wide to keep from falling.

314 Leroy,
315      The Rawhide plan is going well.  Stage A has been accomplished with
316 no problems.  Stage B is beginning.  Counter-surveillance reveals that at
317 least two vehicles are following our snatch team.  Appropriate measures
318 are being taken.
319      We have filled your order for the sheep and five quarts of vasoline.
320 Sorry about the mix-up last time.  We really didn't know that our supplier
321 had inadvertantly sent you Ben Gay instead of the requested vasoline.  Hope
322 you've recovered.  I understand that you were in quite abit of pain.
323       Don't worry about the NET.  No problem with those guys.  One hitch
324 though, some chump made an anonymous phone call to the police and gave them
325 the real story.  My sources within the department were able to control the
326 situation, but things were quite dicey for a while.  Attempt against Ming
327 Louie and Mohammed Wassir failed.  Will try again soon.

334         As the Viking warship stealthily slipped up to the unsuspecting
335 Saxon seaside village, Brodar, the cheiftain, rose and addressed his 
336 followers. "Now, men," he bellowed, "our plan is to burn the village---"
337         "Hoorary!" roared the warriors.
338         "---kill all the men---"
339         "Hooray!"
340         "---and rape all the women!"
341         "Hooray!"
342         "And men..."
343         "Yes, noble Brodar!"

348      Sam had about given up on having anything interesting take
349 place any time soon.  #At least I don't have to worry about
350 not being able to keep up with them# he thought.  The only thing
351 that was still original on the car was the basic shell.  Almost
352 everything else had been replaced with more modern equipment.
353 The one exception to this was the old transistor AM only radio.
354 It had been left in on the insistance of NET 67 because it still
355 managed to get better reception than any of the new 'improved'
356 AM/FM/Cassette/CD decks did.  The engine had a top speed at
357 least twice that of the one it replaced.  When even that was not
358 enough, one could always use the NOS booter (not for too long,
359 as the heat it generated could distroy the engine if used for a
360 long period of time).  The gauges in the dashboard were the same
361 as they always were, but were now backed up by various voice
362 warning systems.  #Yes,# Sam reflected, #it would be hard for
363 anyone to tell that his car was anything other than the simple
364 thing it appeared to be#.  At least he hoped so...  He sighed
365 and settled back for a long and boring drive.  At least they
366 were playing good music for once.

373                         The Handless Mime
374     The mime conjured the dreamful, creative mindset of the audiance. Their
375 curiosity, their wonderment and intrigue which had been chained throughout
376 their long, tiring days was released. They had teathered themselves with
377 seriousness, tress, and the pains of society. The playfulness they had as
378 children had ben lost, given up to conform to society. The vaudevillian's 
379 delightful movements lured their imagination, giving freedom to their
380 ignored creativity.
381     The mime began building a pyramid with imaginary stones. Slowly, as the
382 palms carressed the air, the stones began to form. With flexibilty and 
383 muscles like a dancer, the silent histrio's movements appeared magical, full
384 of life, of undeniable perfection. As the hands slid through the air, rocks
385 seemed to appear. Stacked on the ground, they solidified. The nothingness
386 of the air took shape and the abstractness of the stones became reality. They
387 were not an idle concept or a thing to be imagined, they were not intangible,
388 they were real. Each stone was built on top of others into a peak. The stones
389 were so firmly based that if one should fall or vanish, the pyramid would 
390 remain standing.
391     The thought pyramid was created in the audiance's heads. As if to 
392 chastise them for their society which bound them by invisible chains leaving
393 them out of touch with their own consciousness, the painted face smiled. As
394 if to chastise them for their lack of true expression, their unused tools of
395 communication, the painted face smiled.
396     The mime's hands continued to creat and move magically across the new
397 reality. The mime's eyes glanced at the audiance, with delight and happiness,
398 the eyes danced back to the stones. The pyramid was solid, indestructible, 
399 real. The silent histrio stepped back displaying the new creation. Then, with
400 powerful grace, as if mind dwelled elsewhere, the figure walked through the
401 pyramid. The image was destroyed. The mime became a preformer standing on the
402 white line of a dirty street. The stones which had been built into magnifi-
403 cence vanished in the air. The falsification of reality crushed the thoughts
404 of the audiance. In their minds, the foundating thought pattern of the 
405 inverse pyramid was removed and the entire strusture fell.
406     The crowd of onllokers stared at the vaudevillian, horrified. The 
407 equivocator had showed them the image of truth and then snatched it away. The
408 actor without words stared back at the gaping audiance, their lifeless form.
409 Then, as if it was all an incredible sham, the mime bowed and walked away.

428       Having spoted the p.a.i.n. car, Themnax's ship locked on.  Reopening the
429 NET link, speed, position and other peramiters were uploaded directly to NET hq.
430      At the same time, tightly focused scanning energies were sent out to obser-
431 ve the cars interior.  Of course, in order to do this, he had to flip back to
432 'material'.  Even the slightest risk of being observed violated the H.U.B. 
433 cannons on cultural interfirance, but this would only take a few seconds.
434     What his sensors reported of the car below was total opacity.  Themnax 
435 could do nothing but flip back etherial and await developments on the ground.
436     As long as the situation remained static, he was helpless, Lananaran tech-
437 nology or no.  He could only observe, not well, and file reports, short on use-
438 ful data.  He almost might as well not be there except that he was and would,
439 for the time being remain.
440      Then he noticed that one of the tailing cars was equiped with some highly
441 nonstandard comm gear.  Perhaps a direct chanel could be opened, but to what 
442 purpose, he askethought, arguing himself out of it.  And then again, might as well
443 check and see if its possible, whaiting for the need to arise would be a poor
444 way to find out!

  Among the legions of the many spy organizations, there are
448 always dissenters.  They are silent, and usually smartly
449 good at the things they do.  They use their own methods
450 against there superiors.
451     Being dissenters, they are disorganized. Few in number
452 and in conmvition.  They work though.
453 
  Kosta is an example, but he works from far away.  He bothers
454 to lie about it.  He does not work well.

  "I still have no idea what we are going to do, no one
460 tells me these things.  No one ever does."  Sikks whined.
461   "You never listen to us." Aeght said too pretentiously.
462   "Our so called leaders are full of pomp, and they try to
463 hold their sculptures too tightly.  They consider themselves so
464 special. They think they have soo much talent, that they toy
465 with people like us."  Aeght said.
466   "They toy with us, and they try to sculpt us too.  Just like
467 one of their sculptures, and just like their fountaines.  Our
468 so called leaders are so called leaders, because they toy so
469 well with us.  Ordinary guys like us, siucked into their
470 nurserey and their wive's arms."
471 
  "To them we are nothing.  We are not worth a single thing
472 to them, and so they get new ones whenever they can."  Aeght
473 was actually excited.  Sweat beaded on his forehead.
474 
475   "Actual emotion, from Aeght,"  Thought Sikks, who had always
476 thought that Aeght simply played life like a game, a game of
477 infinate rules, that had always changed.  Especially when it
478 was least favorable at the time, and at the moment."
479 
  Sikks let Aeght speak, and watched Swven and Toeh listen too
480 for the same reasons. Aeght was not in it for power.  So, he
481 did have feelings after all.
482 
  They all sat and listened to the plan about to unfold in
483 front of their very eyes.  A plan, an operation, called THEFT.
484 To take away one of the prize sculptures, the newest one.
485 Farley, and the tools of the THEFT, were a car, and a voice.

517   Given your description of the problem, I'd say that either you never got
518 to enter mode (what you were seeing was peices of command responses from BWMS.
519 ) or possibly somehow you got knocked out of enter mode. This can happen if
520 BW receives a control C (due to line noise or otherwise) 'OR' it receives
521 a break signal again possibly caused by line noise or something else.
522 By the way, yes it does go back to the top of the disk when you use the MA
523 command so that it can update the information. It also goes there when you
524 exit enter mode (with ^C or break) again to update the information.

528     After having recovered from my last trip into DESIRE, I was ready for a
529 new experience. I had no hesitation about what would be my next choice.
530     I walked to the dispensing machine and took my handy escape, placing it
531 in my pocket, I ran not walked to the door labeled ADVENTURE. As I aproached
532 the door I heard the sound of hoof beats on a barren land.  A light touch on
533 the door and it burst open, standing there in front of men was a warm weather
534 beaten face, that seemed to say  "comeone partner, times a wasting". Looking
535 at the smile, I was hooked.  I stepped thru the door to find myself that I will
536 descibe for the lack of better words, dusty, very dusty.  My partner helped me
537 about my mount. Having never ridden a horse before, I wasn't really sure about
538 what to do, lucky for me the horse did. Partner took off in a jump and my horse
539 raced after, leaving me to hang on for dear life. #oh my#
