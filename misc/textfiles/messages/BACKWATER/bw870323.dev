 48 far consist of BWMAKE stuff plus my own testing ramblings (see "Snarf",

 56 entry in the twilight zone. Dee doo dee doo dee doo dee doo dee doo
 57 I'm waiting for the disk to access again to see how long it takes
 58 there it went, took about 1 to 2 seconds. Now *that* is going to
 59 make for some interesting download programs, since when the disk
 60 drives grab the system they shut off interrupts which means you
 61 have to wait for it to come back. Hmmm I don't see any real easy
 62 way around this other than possibly doing what is done in BW
 63 right now, which is to not echo the next character until the disk
 64 is done. Of course that would be basicly what is happening here right 
 65 now. (The disk just accessed again, gives you an idea of how far
 66 between accesses.) Unless we go to ramdisk I don't know any easy 
 67 way around this. Hmmmm what about if we put all the entries into
 68 records on the heap? That would mean making a 80K record file out
 69 on the heap with pointers, then when we go through the hangup procedure
 70 (or drive switch, or maybe on ^C) we could dump it all to disk.
 71 (There went the disk drive again.) Any ideas?

110 (it is 18:10) and we'll see how badly it gets out of wack. The Sanyo never

141 In BW#1 the line numbers default to off on the incomming call.
142 Do we want them on or off? I myself always turn them on first thing,
143 But not everyone does.
144 Point 2, the LI command in BW#1 says how many lines there are
145 when it starts up. It doesn't say anything here. I guess that
146 could be considered a bug.

149 line numbers are an interesting case, i'm sure it's a matter of opinion
150 with each caller.  persoanlly, i tend to leave them alone unless i must
151 look for where i left off...  i don't leave markers and have tryed to
152 resort to memory, which isn't so keen when it comes to remembering a
153 three digit number with a two letter prefix that changes every time i look.
154 oh, and another point about the LIST command...  i typo'd "LI8ST" only to
155 receive a listing starting from line 8.  is the command parser looking only
156 for the first two characters, not caring whether there is a space between
157 the command itself and a variable that may follow?  i typed in "LI90ST" to
158 receive the listing from line 90.

184 Okay, now that some free time has presented itself, I can work on source.
185 I don't understand what's going on with CH ** *,  I suspect it may be a
186 side effect of the permission checking.
187 LIst can easily be modified to display # of lines.  Both LI and PR need work
188 to eliminate the Deleted Lines at Bottom Bug, and I can do it then.
189 Regarding line numbers:  I always turn them off when reading, and turn them
190 on only when I get to the bottom of the disk (so I can read what line number
191 I finished at).  They tend to annoy me on a 40-col screen.  :-}
192 Regarding line IO problem: I'm open for suggestions- procedure "outdisk" is
193 as simple as I could make it.  Can anyone write a  faster routine?
194 Holding lines in memory presents additional problems to be worked out, if
195 this is done.

198 I put the list fix in here as a quick patch. What I did was to look at the 
199 first number used, and if it was "1" or "0" (default) then I printed
200 the "lastline" variable before beginning the listing.
201 Also notice a slight change in how things come up here, I put in a 
202 wait for "cr" when BWII first comes up just after loading the link files
203 but before going into the command procedure loop. I also did some
204 minor work on the INT14 stuff to improve the modem handling.
205 Routines that I have played with so far include: BWII (various things)
206 BWMISC (int14 and keychr), and of course BWLIST (adding the Lines msg).
207 The BWLIST isn't important, you are going to be digging into it anyway,
208 don't worry about that one. Oh yeah, I also changed "prnheader" to remove
209 the "usrname" portion of the header since we decided not to have that
210 in the header since it would take too long to go to the disk and search
211 out the name from the usr.log file.

225 Shawn: re the every six lines delay, I'll bet that it is due to the fact that 
226 six lines @ 82 (83?) char per line = 498.. or just about 1 sector...
227 The @$%%#% software isn't writing to disk til it has a full buffer! If there is
228 a way to force *true* random access to files, then we can just force a write
229 ept that that is *way* too slow)  <sigh>
230 What on *earth* is going on? I'm losing chars at the start of almost every line
231 unless I pause after the cr?!? (I could understand it if it was the disk access
232 but that shouldn't happen this often!) (dare I suggest sending <cr><^S> at the 
233 end of the line and then <^Q> at the start of the line read routine?)
234 That might also make uploads easier for those who can use XON/XOFF...

269 BWCMD: Some cosmetic changes, and LEVEl asks for a password to switch from
270 level 0 to 4.  No password is required to switch back.
271 BWMISC: Printheader modified as it is here.  A new function, Getpass(), has
272 been added.  The status line has the current level number included.
273 BWII: Just got rid of 'username' and related stuff.

278 I'll bring listings of what I have that way we can compare notes in
279 real time. I still need to make some changes to allow for the modem control
280 A lot of it is already in there, but it still needs some work.
281 One problem I have to work on is the DTR/RTS signal control which the
282 Sanyo likes to manipulate everytime it accesses the disk drives. 
283 I know approximately where it is, so I should be able to patch it out without
284 too much trouble. The other thing I want to look into is improving the 
285 disk drive access time. The problem is that it goes out and gets a sector, and 
286 by the time it gets done printing that sector the disk drives have shut down
287 so the system has to turn them back on and wait for them to come up to speed
288 thus the big slow down. The big problem is that there is hardware limitations
289 involved as they use the head select line from the disk controller to turn
290 the drive motor on so when the disk controller decides it is time to unload
291 the head the drive gets turned off. What I want to do is figure out how
292 to leave the disk running all the time while on line, thus not needing 
293 the powerup delay sort of like BW currently works. I don't know if it is 
294 possible, but I want to at least look into it.

310 allow their use.  Eventually, they will be used (when the full definition of

315 Gee, the clock is 20 hours slow... can a Sanyo use a "zero-slot clock"
316 board such are sold for the IBM?

321 As I remember, the "zero slot clock" still uses a slot, but attaches
322 itself in such a way that it leaves the slot open for another card.
323 As such no, the Sanyo can't use it because it doesn't have any slots
324 to attach to. I'm not sure how to handle that particular problem
325 since it involves the sanyo internal timing. There are some adapter
326 boards that you can buy for the Sanyo that give it a better clock,
327 but that costs money. Sigh....
328 Milch: did you fix Replace so that it displays the line you are replacing
329 before actually doing same as per current BW?
330 It is a bit unnerving not knowing if you are replacing the line
331 you think you are replacing.

333 I've seen ads for at least one 'zero-slot clock' that was a *small* board that 
334 you plugged the 8088 into and then plugged into the 8088 socket. If you wish,
335 I'll check on price and other details. If it's in the <$30 range, it could
336 probably be thrown in with the modem purchase.
337 ng that, maybe something hooked up to a second serial port (as I recall, you
338 used to sell com2 boards for the Sanyo?)

342 No, the Sanyo does not have a com2 port. It only has a com1 port which
343 is an extra cost option. (and is what I was selling).
344 Disk buffering problems. I looked into it, and it doesn't look very
345 promising from a stand point of rewriting the drivers. There are some
346 hardware limitations. I think the best approach would be to do it in buffers
347 or a ram disk and wait to do the updates until after they hangup.
348 Any ideas? This could possibly make coding easier since we wouldn't have
349 to load everthing into memory, only update the things that have changed.
350 It is possible to ugrade the Sanyo to 512K, though it isn't easy, and
351 does require a patched DOS to do so. A better approach is to buy a
352 video board that has the extra memory on board. An even better approach
353 is to get a "real" PC clone....
354 ************************ CISTOP MIKEY ****************************
355 P.S. The is a add on board for the Sanyo for $200 that adds up to 768k of
356 memory to the system, has a built in battery backup clock. If I had $200
357 to throw away I would consider getting it.

362 Cistop; your message on drive a (in front of the door) certainly made
363 me stop to think for a moment.  i'm sure that most readers with any
364 form of conscience for the other fellow also took pause.  not often
365 do we find such frank expressions of "that's the way things are, joe."
366 i know it must sound rather shallow to ask, but is there anything any
367 of us might be able to do to offer you help to ease these rough times?

402 That depends on how you look at it. There is value in the Sanyo, and you
403 have to look at that as well. Is it worth it to put additional money
404 into the machine and *still* not have a fully compatible computer,
405 or is it cheaper (or at least a reasonable break even) to sell the Sanyo
406 for what can be gotten out of it and use the money to buy a *real* clone.
407 If I can get $400-$500 for the Sanyo I can use it towards the clone 
408 purchase. If you add the $200 that would also be spent on the adapter 
409 board then we have $600-$700 purchasing power towards a real clone.
410 I would sell the Sanyo except that I can currently get more use out
411 of it than the $400-$500 I could get out of it, and I don't have the
412 additional money to offset the price differential.I would keep one
413 Sanyo anyway since I need it to support the CL+'s that are out there.

418 Milch: The DTR glitching I can fix so we can use a modem on the beast.
419 The lost data because of the disk drive access time is another matter.
420 The Sanyo just plain has a flakey disk drive settup. I could improve
421 it a bit by rewritting the disk drive routines, but that would only
422 drop the time down from 2 seconds to 1 second or so. It still is a 
423 pain, and that would be a lot of rewritting code for that. It also
424 requires some hardware changes as the 2 second delay is built into
425 the hardware. The best approach I think would be a RAM disk, but
426 there isn't any money for the add on memory... sigh.....

430 replaced.  I can fix that... but L'homme has already got a copy of what I
431 have now.  *sigh*.
432 Re: drive access, anyone know what the address is for the floppy controller?
433 There's gotta be a bit or two we could twiddle...  but that's messy.  How
434 much extra memory do you have in the Sanyo?  Maybe we could make do with
435 a small ramdisk, and use it for temporaries...
436 Re: level 5, yah, I know, I've seen the problem, and worked on it a little.
437 Seems that what *I* want to do and what C thinks are slightly different, 
438 especially when EOF occurs.   I should have a fix for it by next week.  Maybe
439 I can scrouge up a cheap copy of a C compiler for the XT...
440 I'll write to bwdt when the revised source is available at
441 percival in my login directory.
442 Okay, should have fixed copy of the sources for you tomorrow... what an
443 important meet this will be.  Lots of things on the agenda-
444 Harumph.  Looks desolate up front.  A bit of doorish magic should stir things
445 up.

450 Actaully I haven't gotten anywhere at all on it yet, I was too zonked last
451 night to get anything done. Things at work have taken a turn to making
452 life more difficult. I was switched to working with MG on the project he was
453 working on because the dead line got moved up to the first of May. So they
454 are throwing another programmer at it to try to get it finished. Given
455 that there is $2 million riding on the deal, and that translates to profit
456 share, I have an interest in it getting out myself.
457 I'm going to try to get a little work done on it this weekend, but I also
458 have to read up on the instrument that I will be programming (since I don't
459 know how it even works yet, let alone operate the thing), in addition to
460 having to get an update to CL+ out this weekend as well (a 50 unit sale
461 rides on that one). Can you say "pressure".... I knew you couldn't :-)-:
