 68                     CHINA PURGES PARTY LEADER:-6/26/89
 69     In a major push by hard-liners, the head of China's 47 million member 
 70 Communist Party, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, was ousted during the weekend 
 71 for "supporting the turmoil" of pro-democracy demonstrations. Two members of 
 72 the Standing Committee - the party's most powerful body - also were removed 
 73 for being moderate.
 74     Jiang Zemin replaces Zhao Ziyang as the new head of the Chinese Communist 
 75 Party. Zemin has preferred economic, rather than political solutions during 
 76 his career as an engineer and manager. A graduate of Shanghai's Jiaotong 
 77 University, Jiang, 61, knows several languages. A former mayor of 
 78 Shanghai,he's in charge of the campaign to cover up the massacre on Tiananmen 
 79 Square.
 80 HONG KONG GRIPPED BY FEAR:-6/26/89
 81     In Hong Kong - from fashionable high-rises on "The Peak" to teeming 
 82 apartments amid industrial districts in Kowloon - there are signs of fear. 
 83 Students hand out pamphlets urging Hong Kong's 5.7 million citizens to keep up 
 84 the struggle for democracy - and their free-wheeling capitalist way of life. 
 85 The reason for fear: The reversion of the colony to Chinese authority on July 
 86 1, 1997.
 87     The turmoil in China has had a dramatic effect on the financial markets of 
 88 Hong Kong, China's largest trading partner. For two decades, the British 
 89 colony has funneled foreign investment into China. But all that changed. The 
 90 demonstrations and the massacre in Beijing will have lasting effects, says 
 91 Deborah Kuenstner, an investment strategist at Merrill Lynch International 
 92 Research.
 93                                                                             
 94                       TOUGHER SPILL LAWS DEMANDED:-6/26/89
 95     Pressure will build for Congress to enact tougher laws to prevent oil 
 96 spills after tanker mishaps this weekend in waters near Rhode Island, Delaware 
 97 and Texas, experts say. "This will galvanize support," says spill specialist 
 98 Richard Golob. The 1.5 million gallons spilled is 13 percent of that spilled 
 99 in the Exxon Valdez disaster.
100     Cleanup crews worked feverishly Sunday on oil spills in Rhode Island, 
101 Delaware and Texas while residents worried about its effects in their 
102 backyards. The Delaware spill appeared to be the worst - molasses-like blobs 
103 threaten wildlife in rivers and wetlands. In Newport, R.I., about 200 National 
104 Guard troops, 200 volunteers and 120 state prison inmates fought the oil.
105     Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., promised Sunday to take up oil-spill 
106 legislation once the Senate returns for business on July 10. Among bills 
107 introduced since the March 24 Exxon spill: a $1 billion cleanup bill; improved 
108 safety guidelines on tankers; and tougher background checks on captains.
109     Rhode Island has filed charges against the operators of a Greek tanker 
110 that dumped 420,000 gallons of heating oil into Narragansett Bay. The state 
111 says that Ballard Shipping of Athens, Greece, and the tanker captain broke 
112 state law by operating a ship too close to shore without a local pilot. A 
113 court hearing is set for Wednesday. A federal investigation is also under way.
114     In Delaware, crews Sunday refloated the Uruguayan tanker Presidente Rivera 
115 and took it to a dock. The ship spilled 800,000 gallons of oil into the 
116 Delaware River Saturday; it held 19 million gallons of refined oil.
117     A tug-driven barge in Texas' Galveston Bay ruptured Friday when it 
118 collided with a cargo ship. Most of the oil flowed into a narrow channel, 
119 where cleanup crews could easily contain it. Joe Carr, harbormaster of the 
120 Houston Yacht Club, says he's seen no wildlife killed.
121                                                                              
122 Conspiracy or Coincidence?  Too much oil's been spilled.
123                                                                               
124                      POLL - CANADIANS DISLIKE YANKS:-6/26/89
125     Twenty-nine percent of Canadians see U.S. citizens as "aggressive, 
126 obnoxious, pigheaded snobs," while 43 percent of Americans think of them as 
127 "friendly, good neighbors," according to a poll of 2,000 for the Canadian 
128 magazine Maclean's, on stands Monday Sixty percent of us think Canada should 
129 be a state while 14 percent of Canadians do.
130

133 As Lee Atwater, head of the Republican National Committee said:  "If we can 
134 just spill enough oil, destroy enough wildlife, let enough Chinese students 
135 die, maim enough Nicaraguans, sell enough drugs in this country, and let AIDS
136 kill enough of those Liberal Democrats, we could have a Republican majority in
137 the House"

221    Interesting to note "their" religion and government and economy
222 interacted as a whole - Prayer Booths give economic messages,
223 the government requires you to be on sedatives to increase
224 your production in a dangerous environment, and the religion helped
225 to distract the masses away from all of this.  Then there was the
226 part about how "All of the insides are missing from these people...",
227 which the "Hologram" said to THX.  Another "social" point - all
228 of the holograms were black, all of the "outside world" was white.
229 To top it off, the hologram complains about "not being in the
230 real world", so he "left" his station.

257    WATERBURY, Vt. (AP) -- Are Oreos politically correct?
258    More than 400 shareholders of Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. debated that
259 question and other issues more related to politics than profits at the ice crea
260 maker's annual meeting last weekend.
261    Shareholder Ross Connelly of Hardwick complained that the board of directors
262 of such a socially conscious company shouldn't be "all white and all male."
263    Company co-founder Ben Cohen said efforts were being made to rectify the
264 problem.
265    Shareholder Elizabeth Kmon of Massachusetts questioned the company's use of
266 Nabisco products such as Oreos in some of its ice cream flavors. She said she
267 boycotts Nabisco because the company is owned by a cigarette maker, R.J.
268 Reynolds.
269    Ben & Jerry's officials said they're looking for a substitute for Oreos, but
270 have not yet found another cookie that remains crunchy while submerged in ice
271 cream.
272                                                                             
273 DELAWARE CLEANUP SLOWS DOWN:-6/28/89
274     Heat hampered Delaware River cleanup efforts Tuesday as huge globs of oil 
275 liquefied into a sticky mass. Only 65,000 gallons out of 306,684 gallons 
276 spilled Saturday by a tanker have been cleaned up, prompting the state to file 
277 a suit against the tanker's operators for the slow cleanup pace. The oil 
278 apparently won't mar beaches, officials said, and wildlife suffered minimal 
279 damage. 
280     
281 RHODE ISLAND BEACHES REOPEN:
282     Most Rhode Island beaches will be open for swimming by the upcoming 
283 holiday weekend, state officials say. Three days of bright sunlight and warm 
284 temperatures have evaporated about 85 percent of the heating oil spilled 
285 Friday by the grounding of a Greek tanker. Beaches in Upper Narragansett Bay 
286 were reopened Monday.
287     
288 INVESTIGATIONS LOOKS AT SPILLS:
289     Federal investigations have begun of weekend oil spills by ships in Rhode 
290 Island and Texas. At a hearing Tuesday in Houston, tanker Capt. Michael Gale 
291 said he was stopped in the channel when a tugboat towing a barge rammed into 
292 him. In Rhode Island, tanker helmsman Konstandinos Paraskevopulos wouldn't 
293 talk, citing the Fifth Amendment.
294 DEBATE - OIL-- USA TODAY'S OPINION:
295     Finally the effort to develop new oil-spill technology must be stepped up, 
296 at oil industry expense. The federal budget for spill research has been cut 80 
297 percent in three years. The people in six states who have had to fight oil 
298 spills in a single week are fed up. So are the rest of us. It's time for 
299 results. No more promises.
300     PATRICIA NELSON LIMERICK, historian at the University of Colorado: We have 
301 made it through eight years of one president smiling and telling us not to 
302 worry, and now we face four years with another president whose attention seems 
303 focused on the care of puppies and the protection of the American flag, not on 
304 oil spills.
305     CHARLES J. DIBONA, president of the American Petroleum Institute: The 
306 three oil spills last weekend have intensified calls for legislation to 
307 correct the problem. No one can guarantee that all spills can be prevented. A 
308 better job can be done, however, and the industry is going forward with its 
309 best efforts.
310     ALLEN MURRAY, CEO, Mobil Oil: "Recognizing the extreme difficulties 
311 presented by a catastrophic spill ... industry can promise only its very best 
312 efforts in responding to such spills."
313     ARTHUR MCKENZIE, director, Tanker Advisory Center, on resistance to using 
314 double-hulled tankers: "The oil industry is acting the same way the auto 
315 industry did in fighting seat belts."
316     WAKEFIELD, R.I., Fran Gould, 26, restaurant manager: "Companies need to 
317 pay more attention to whom they are hiring. A lot of ship captains are not 
318 following proper navigation rules. The spill that occurred in our area 
319 happened because there was not even a captain directing the ship. We need 
320 stiffer penalties ..."
321     PARLIN, N.J., Len Spanjersberg, 66, retired window dresser: "I think we 
322 should start using more modern ships to transport oil instead of the pieces of 
323 junk we're using now. These old tankers have been around since World War II. 
324 That's what is causing so many accidents and spills ..."
325 DELAWARE CLEANUP SLOWS DOWN:-6/28/89
326     Heat hampered Delaware River cleanup efforts Tuesday as huge globs of oil 
327 liquefied into a sticky mass. Only 65,000 gallons out of 306,684 gallons 
328 spilled Saturday by a tanker have been cleaned up, prompting the state to file 
329 a suit against the tanker's operators for the slow cleanup pace. The oil 
330 apparently won't mar beaches, officials said, and wildlife suffered minimal 
331 damage.
332     Federal investigations have begun of weekend oil spills by ships in Rhode 
333 Island and Texas. At a hearing Tuesday in Houston, tanker Capt. Michael Gale 
334 said he was stopped in the channel when a tugboat towing a barge rammed into 
335 him. In Rhode Island, tanker helmsman Konstandinos Paraskevopulos wouldn't 
336 talk, citing the Fifth Amendment.
337                         (It's all Greek to me, he said)                       
338                                                                              
339 HAIR DRESS A CUT ABOVE-6/28/89
340     When Martha Hayes wants to clean her favorite dress she just shampoos it 
341 and gives it a quick blow dry. 
342     Because Martha's one-of-a-kind, knee-length, short-sleeve dress is made 
343 from human hair. 
344     The North Carolina hair-weaver says she spent months sewing the furry 
345 fashion -- a process that included stitching hair into wafts that resemble a 
346 grass skirt. 
347     Then she tacked the wafts onto a size 7 black slip starting with ink-black 
348 hair at neck and ending with auburn along the hem. 
349     Hayes says most of the lucky ladies who've sported the hairy outfit report 
350 feeling more feminine, but others thought it was hot and itchy. 
351     Despite mixed reviews, Hayes says she wouldn't part with her precious 
352 hairpiece dress for any price. 
353     In fact, she considers it a work of art and thinks it should be displayed

356 BOMBS BLOW OUT COLD FUSION-6/28/89
357     It appears that so-called "cold fusion" power is a lot of hot air. 
358     But there's a new source of energy that could power cities for decades to 
359 come: hydrogen bombs. 
360     According to California physicist Ralph Moir (Moyer), exploding nuclear 
361 bombs in specially designed caves would eliminate the energy crisis. 
362     Here's the idea he outlined in the journal Fusion Technology: 
363     First, dig a cave the size of a football field in a mountain. Next, line 
364 the cave with steel and fill it with salt droplets. Finally, detonate a 
365 hydrogen bomb every 40 minutes. 
366     Moir (Moyer) says the explosions will vaporize the salt and produce enough 
367 heat to turn a giant turbine on the surface. 
368     Moir (Moyer) says detonating about 8,000 bombs per year should run a power 
369 plant about the size of today's nuclear reactors.--M.D.

372                         CHINA UNREST MIGHT SPREAD:-6/28/89
373     The Chinese economy, facing serious troubles aggravated by Beijing's 
374 crackdown on dissent, could soon stir a new wave unrest that might extend 
375 beyond the cities into the country, according to Western diplomats monitoring 
376 the situation in Beijing, Wednesday's Washington Post reports.
377     A 21-year-old student leader, wanted for his role in protests preceding 
378 the Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, predicted China's leaders would 
379 capitulate to the pro-democracy movement. Wu'er Kaixi, who did an interview 
380 from Hong Kong on the NBC Nightly News, was last seen in public before troops 
381 opened fire on protesters in Beijing June 4. He was smuggled out of the 
382 country.
383                                                                           
384                        HUD WOES BLAMED ON COMPUTER:-6/28/89
385     Housing and Urban Development officials are blaming inadequate accounting 
386 computer controls as a factor in the agency's management scandal. 
387 Investigators are searching for more than $20 million in HUD revenues that 
388 might have been misappropriated. The June 26 Government Computer News reports 
389 that lax computer recording systems possibly prevented earlier detection of 
390 the missing funds.
391                                                                               
392                       BUSH WANTS TO OVERRULE COURT:-6/28/89
393     President Bush denounced flag-burning as "wrong" and vowed to lead the 
394 fight for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's 
395 protection of the act. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last week that the First 
396 Amendment protected flag-burners. House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., has 
397 suggested new laws rather than a constitutional amendment.
398     President Bush is sailing into perilous waters by taking the lead on a 
399 constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning, legal experts say. "Amending the 
400 Constitution is tortuous, slow going, and it's difficult to succeed," says 
401 University of Virginia law professor A.E. Dick Howard. Though 10,375 
402 constitutional amendments have been proposed in Congress, only 26 have passed.
403                                                                              
404                      U.S. REWARDS ARE YOURS-6/28/89
405     Do you want to make a few extra bucks?
406     Just become a stool pigeon for the government.
407     That's the word from the book "Rewards Offered by the United States." 
408     It tells how to cash in on zillions of government rewards by being a rat 
409 fink. 
410     Author Larry Dreyfus says you could make $100,000 by snitching on someone 
411 who owes one million bucks in unpaid taxes. 
412     But that's chicken feed compared to the reward for squealing on a nuclear 
413 weapons smuggler. 
414     The government will give you half a million dollars for that tip. 
415     Dreyfus says the largest government rewards come from illegal money schemes
416 such as laundering, counterfeiting or drug dealing. 
417     The former U.S. Customs Agent even includes a "10 commandments of 
418 collecting rewards" in his book.--M.D.

421                      WADSWORTH, Ill. (AP) -- Zoning officials didn't object to 
422 or the shark-filled moat. But they had enough when Jim Onan put a 45-foot statu
423 of a pharoah on his front lawn.
424    The town took him to court under a zoning ordinance that puts a 25-foot limi
425 o structures in residential neighborhoods.
426    The 52-year-old Onan, a construction contractor, decided on a way of getting
427 around the regulation: He's burying the 200-ton statue of Ramses II in gravel u
428 to its knees.
429    Onan says he intends to spend $25,000 to bury all but 25 feet of Ramses II.
430    "I love it because they're making a fool of themselves," Onan said in a
431 telephone interview from his pyramid home Friday.
432    The choice of Ramses II is fitting: He ruled Egypt from 1290 to 1224 B.C.,
433 and was known for his ambitious building projects -- much like Onan.
434    Onan completed his 5-story-tall, gold-plated pyramid five years ago near
435 Wadsworth, a town just south of the Wisconsin border.
436    Townspeople haven't exactly rallied to Onan's defense in the statue case.
437    "I don't think there's anyone who had anything good to say about it," said
438 Village President Ed Tomkowiak.

457           If the Academy Awards really had anything to do with with who 
458         actually did some good acting this year...Jack Nicholson would 
459         walk away with three, maybe four of those little toads. 
460         
461           Gotham City was truly a work of art, reminiscent of Los Angeles 
462         2017 in BLADERUNNER, which itself was inspired by Fritz Lange's 
463         METROPOLIS.

467         argyles off. Brief but satisfying moments of visual rapture. 
468         
469              The only real disappointment was the Lloyd Cinemas.
470         When I saw INDIANA JONES (and The Last Ark of Doom) at Tigard 
471         Cinemas, Mr. THX Dolby Sound was cranked up so loud and full it 
472         sucked the air out of your lungs. At Lloyd the sound was so meek 
473         the music had no drama, I missed some of the dialogue, and the 
474         Surround Sound was a complete loss. THX isn't worth a tinker's 
475         damn at polite volume levels.

510 And why do lurkers lurk?  And when they lurk, why do they post messages
511 saying they lurk?  If a message left by someone calling themselves a
512 lurker says nothing but "I am lurking", are they still lurking?  Haven't
513 they entered something?  Granted, the content of such communication is
514 very low, but it still expresses an idea of sorts.  And do messages about

609 Voices?  You mean like those voices in my head that tell me to get a
610 high-powered laser rifle and blast those bits of tree branch that
611 block my window?  Are they male, female, both, or neither?  Do they
612 whisper to you about the future?  Can you understand them at all?
613 Or are these more like the voices that tell you to go out and dive
614 into a swimming pool filled with lime jello so as to improve Earth's
615 chances of being accepted into the InterGalactic League?  I just
616 wanna know about these guys you hear!

633 swob: *PLEASE* don't do that!  It sends terminal programs with Auto

635 pause while my terminal program figures out what is going on.  I got
636 rid of it.  (I could turn off ADL, but the work involved isn't worth it).
637 Of course, I could just put my terminal into dumb mode, which means no
638 interpretation of anything but CR/LF, but then I couldn't use all those
639 fancy ANSI escape sequences.  Some time ago a few Inngoers tried to find
640 a control character that could be inserted into text

659 can't do much about it or anything else so why worry? So I just don't even

696 Cold fusion: Last time I looked, it seems that low temperature fusion
697 is a reality.  It isn't something that can be done by a beginning
698 chemistry student, as once was thought (the conductors must be flushed
699 of any hydrogen contamination, and *KEPT* that way during the process,
700 which means continuously flushing the gases emitted with argon).  What
701 it might be used for and how is still very much up in the air.
702 Exxon: I tend to feel that cleaning efforts should begin as soon as
703 word of the spill reaches management, and DA*N the cost.  I like a
704 tidy planet, don't you?
705 China: I haven't heard anything about this recently.  The dead count
706 keeps changing apparently at random.  Anyone heard anything more

822           (June 25,1989)
823      10 of the Most Overplayed Records and Artists
824  
825      I've got to get this off my chest.  There are a number of records and
826 artists that are constantly overplayed on radio stations of almost every format
827 Many of these records may have been considered good or significant at one time,
828 but the subsequent exposure suggests that Peter Finch's actions in the movie
829 "Network" are relevant here (when he yells out the window that "I'm mad as hell
830 and not going to take it anymore").  In no particular order, here are my choice
831 for the 10 records or artists that are heard far too much.
832  
833      1. The Way It Is - Bruce Hornsby & The Range. Disc Jockeys have always bee
834 soft touches for records that allegedly "say something".  And with references t
835 civil rights, war and all the other horrors of the last 30 years, this record
836 makes a statement.  But come on guys, enough is enough.  The background music i
837 droning, and Hornsby's vocals are unspectacular.
838  
839      2. The Boxer & Bridge Over Troubled Water - Simon and Garfunkel.  This is 
840 tie between the two worst records of their career.  Both songs are extremely
841 overlong, dull and really, make little sense.  Never mind the Grammy Awards, if
842 you want to avoid a tedious 5 plus minutes of nothingness, turn your dial.
843  
844      3. Hey Jude - The Beatles. With all the great music the "Fab Four" gave us
845 I have never understood how this annoyingly repetitious song was their all-time
846 biggest hit.  For a refreshing diversion, try Wilson Pickett's soulful 1969
847 version of "Hey Jude".
848  
849      4. Nights In White Satin - Moody Blues.  I can handle the shorter 1972
850 single version of this, but forget the long "Days of Future Passed" album
851 version or anything else in that set. Despite the raves of critics, the Moody
852 Blues have not had a good record since their early releases of "Go Now" and
853 "Stop" in the middle sixties.
854  
855      5. American Pie - Don McLean. I immediately reach for the Maalox when thos
856 immortal words "A long long time ago" come on the radio.  This is a record mean
857 to be played about once a year, similar to looking at an old photo album,
858 perhaps to reflect on the past.
859  
860      6. Suite: Judy Blue Eyes - Crosby Stills and Nash.  Yes, this was a great
861 album when released in 1969, when these three superstars were brought together,
862 but the opening track has suffered from 20 years of overexposure.
863  
864      7. Crimson and Clover - Tommy James & The Shondells. And let's give
865 honorable mention to "Crystal Blue Persuasion".  None of the Tommy James record
866 will find their way into the Smithsonian, or even the Rock and Roll
867 Hall-Of-Fame, but how about a little "Say I Am" or "Mirage" once in a while?
868  
869      8. My Sweet Lord - George Harrison. If you apply the descriptions of one t
870 seven above, they are all apropos here. Ditto the "All Things Must Pass" album,
871 a~ unimpressive three record collection of "My Sweet Lord" type songs.
872  
873      9. Almost any song by Credence Clearwater Revival, Doobie Brothers or
874 Steely Dan.  I loved these groups when they hit the pop scene (I still have the
875 first two Steely Dan albums) but these groups are played in disproportion to
876 their influence or significance.  Oddly, Steely Dan's best record "FM (No Stati
877 At All)" is rarely heard.
878  
879      10. Judy In Disguise - John Fred & His Playboy Band.  How this record got
880 to Number 1 in early 1968 was a mystery then. Why it is constantly played on
881 oldie stations, especially in either poor or non-existent stereo is a enigma
882 now.  Along with "Disco Duck" by Rick Dees in 1976, and "Dominique" by the
883 Singing Nun (1963), this is probably the worst record to hit the top of the
884 charts in the entire rock era.
885  
886      Also worthy of being included on this list are the following: "La Bamba" b
887 Richie Valens; anything by Harry Chq`in; "Get Together" by the Youngbloods; the
888 long version of "Time Has Come Today" by the Chambers Brothers; "Lola" from the
889 Kinks; "You Made Me So Very Happy by Blood, Sweat and Tears; and virtually all
890 1960's records of the Beach Boys and the Supremes.
891  
892      Although no one can throw rotten tomatoes at me through the computer
893 screen, I await your outrage and criticisms.  Many of us are accustomed to
894 blindly accepting the gospel of the critics and music is no exception.  But if
895 you think about it, I just may be right.- Ira Bruce Simmons

938 the households in the United States contain a firearm.

942     After two years of firecracker growth, the U.S. competer industry is 
943 starting to fizzle. A computer sales slowdown, expected and dreaded for nearly 
944 a year, is here. Nobody is saying that conditions are anywhere as dismal as 
945 they were in the industry slump of 1985-86. However, experts predict that the 
946 computer slowdown will get worse before it gets better.
947  HOW BAD IS BUSINESS?
948     Companies can expect losses and layoffs during the next six months to a 
949 year. In recent weeks more than a dozen high-flyers have stunned the 
950 investment community with news that sales and earnings will be lower than 
951 expected, including Apple Computer Inc., Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-
952 Packard Co.
953  ARE OTHER COMPUTER COMPANIES SUFFERING?
954     Worse yet, others - such as computer software maker Ashton-Tate Corp., 
955 workstation company Sun Microsystems Inc., and minicomputer makers Wang 
956 Laboratories Inc. - say they could report a loss. Last week Amdahl Corp. said 
957 its quarterly net income would be down 25 percent, its first quarterly decline 
958 in three years.
959  WHY ARE QUARTERLY PROFITS DOWN?
960     LSI Logic Corp. says it too will have lower quarterly profits because 
961 computer customers are delaying orders of its computer chips. The latter news 
962 hit hard, prompting investment banking house Kidder Peabody to slash earnings 
963 estimates on a rash of chip makers. Those that aren't dead are badly wounded, 
964 says Richard Shaffer, editor of the Computer Letter.
965  ARE THERE OTHER INDICATIONS OF A SLOWDOWN?
966     Two precursors to the 1985-86 slump have surfaced again: Unused computer 
967 chips are stacking up, lowering orders for the March through April period. 
968 And, electronics employment in Silicon Valley, the nation's technology 
969 heartland, has edged downward for four consecutive months, a first since the 
970 fall of 1986.
971  HOW ARE CUSTOMERS REACTING?
972     Perhaps the most distressing element of this slowdown is the reason given 
973 by most experts: customer confusion - which also was the culprit in the 
974 disastrous technology recession of 1985-86. Customers are baffled by the mad 
975 jockeying of firms as each pushes its own computer design to be the most 
976 widely accepted - the de facto standard.
977  WHAT ARE OTHER REASONS FOR THE INDUSTRY'S CURRENT STATE?
978     Other reasons for the slowdown: the onslaught of truly powerful PCs has 
979 many questioning the need for mini computers and other big smart boxes. And, 
980 long delays in getting announced products to market is putting off buyers.
981  WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM?
982     The industry is making the same mistake it made in 1983, says Fred 
983 Gibbons, chairperson of Software Publishing Corp. There are too many options. 
984 There are 20 different standards. The industry is forgetting who the customers 
985 are and giving them overblown, overkill products. Customer confusion is more 
986 than a glitch, it's a problem, he says.
987  WHY ARE TOO MANY CHOICES A PROBLEM?
988     In the past year, buyers have been besieged by a multitude of choices. 
989 Worse yet, there has been a rash of rhetoric about how all of them will 
990 survive in the market. The reason is that some computer designs use radically 
991 different software that cannot always be interchanged. It would be like trying 
992 to run a VHS video cassette tape in a Beta VCR.
993  COULDN'T IT BE MADE TO WORK?
994     It just wouldn't work. This isn't new in the industry, but it's gettinw 
9)5 wildly complicated as new computer designs hit the market. Instead of two main 
996 designs of a couple years ago - by IBM Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. - there 
997 are now seven possibilities. If one adds in smaller players, such as Atari 
998 Corp. and Commodore International Inc., it rises to nine.
