43 GOODBYE, ONE AND ALL, I MUST SAY THAT ITS BEEN FUN.
44 Taxes assume that the people who pay taxes are responsible for the 
45 problems of those that receive the money.  I didn't make anybody
46 poor, nor old.  Not my problem.  My problem is keeping enough of
47 my own money to pay my own bills.

52 Ah, but it is your problem, Mr. Red Neck, because if those that have 
53 won't help those that won't, history shows that those that don't have 
54 will take everything from those that have, and sometimes in an 
55 extremely violent manner.  It is in everyone's best interest to keep 
56 the poor above the level of blind rage over their misfortune, or the  
57 guillotine awaits, as King Louis XVI found out.  A tisket, a tasket, 
58 a bourgeois head in a basket.  What fun!!!  A bit bloody too.

97 WELL, YOU GOT ME THERE DOM. I GUESS THE THERAPY, IF EFFECTIVE, WOULD BE
98 A FIRST SUCCESS FOR THE PSYCHOANALYTIC MODEL - NOT A LIKELY EVENT. BUT
99 BEFORE I GOT THAT FAR I'D BE SHOT, IF THE CHRISTIANS RAN TRUE TO FORM. IF
100 PEOPLE WANTED TO BE CURED THEY ALREADY WOULD BE.
101    ANYWAY, I HAVE SOME GROUND I'D LIKE TO STAKE OUT IN THE RELIGIOUS
102 DEBATE BUT THE SUBJECT NOW SEEMS TO BE TAXES.
103 
104 I THINK THE IDEA THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE MEDICAL DEDUCTIONS DOESN'T GET
105 VERY FAR WHEN EXAMINED. AFTER ALL, WHO IS LESS ABLE TO EARN, AND THUS TO
106 PAY, THAN SOMEONE SICK?
107 
108 I TEND TO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ON ALL SIDES OF THE DEBATE ARE DISHEARTENED
109 AT THE FEELING THEY HAVE THE TAXES DON'T DO MUCH GOOD. THEY SEEM TO
110 GO UP WITHOUT ANY RELATIONSHIP TO INCREASING BENEFIT. SOCIAL SECURITY TAX,
111 THE FIRST BIG ITEM, GOES UP ANY LIVING CONDITIONS FOR OLD PEOPLE GO DOWN.
112 MILITARY TAXES GO UP AND THEY BUILD LOSING WEAPONS LIKE THE MX AND LINE
113 CONTRACTORS POCKETS WITH THE REST OF THE MONEY. ETC.
114 
115 PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY, INCLUDING ESPECIALLY
116 SOME OF THE WIDE EYED INTELLECTUALS, ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SOPHISTICATED
117 AS REGARDS OTHER CULTURES, TYPES OF ADMINISTRATION, WAYS OF DOING THINGS.
118 WITH A LITTLE MORE EXPOSURE TO ALTERNATIVES, I THINK WE MIGHT SEE LESS
119 DOGMA AND MORE DISCUSSION OF THE PRACTICE. 
120 
121 ALL OF THE POLITIAL THEORIES BREAK DOWN FAST WHEN IT COMES TO PRACTICE.
122 FOR INSTANCE, CONSIDER USER TAXES FOR PARKS. SOME PEOPLE WILL FEEL THAT THEY
123 CAN'T AFFORD THE USER FEES. YET AS CITIZENS THEY 'OWN' THE LAND IN THE PARK
124 AS MUCH AS ANYONE, DO THEY NOT. PERHAPS IF THE THINK ABOUT IT THEY WILL 
125 WANT TO SELL THE PARK. JAMES WATT WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR THEM. THEN 
126 WHERE ARE ALL THOSE WELL OFF PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BE ON THE USER FEE SYSTEM.
127 
128 TROUBLE IS, NOBODY CAN GET MORE SELF RIGHTEOUS THAN A WINNER. "I DID IT
129 MYSELF, WITH NO HELP FROM ANYONE" IS THEIR CRY. NEVER MIND THAT THE I.Q.
130 WAS A GIFT OF NATURE, THE DETERMINATION A GIFT OF NATURE AND PARENTS, 
131 THE EDUCATION THE BRAIN THRIVED ON GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED, THE FACT THAT
132 SOCIETY VALUED THE PARTICULAR SKILLS THEY HAD AT THE TIME THEY LIVED AN
133 ACCIDENT OF HISTORY. 
134 
135 NO MATTER WHAT TIME YOU ARE IN, YOU WILL FIND THAT THE WELL OFF HAVE A 
136 RIGHT TO THEIR WEALTH, AND THE "LESS WELL OFF", TO USE THE CURRENT
137 GOVERNMENT EUPHEMISM FOR MISERY, ARE BELIEVED BY THE RULERS TO BE
138 RATHER UNFORTUNATE. THIS DOES NOT DEPEND ON EARNING MONEY OR ANYTHING OF
139 THE SORT. MOST MANAGERIAL TYPES DO NOT 'EARN' MONEY, THEY JUST 'GET' 
140 MONEY. THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEMS THAN
141 OUR OWN GET BY WITH A FRACTION OF THE MANAGERS THAT WE DO. YET OUR
142 VP'S BELIEVE THEY HAVE ARE THE CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY AND DESERVE ALL THEY 
143 CAN GET.
144 
145 THE WINNERS TALK ABOUT WHY THEY WON, AND THE LOSERS SAY "DEAL THE CARDS"
146 
147 THUS IT WILL EVER BE.

150 What kind of tax system do you expect from the government?  Precisely the 
151 current one!  Give each person one vote.  Most people consider themselves middle class, with a small fraction of the 'rich.'
152 It is to be expected that the middle class will want to be supported by the 'rich', whom they believe can support them.
153 The legislators are falling all over themselves to implement such a system, because they know that as long as they please
154 the majority, it doesn't matter what they do to the minority.
155     It is widely (and incorrectly) thought that Willie Sutton, the bank robber, said in response to the question 'Why do
156 you rob banks.','  'Because that's where the money is.'  Even so, government officials could well say the same about the
157 'rich.'   The 'poor' are so busy resenting the 'rich' for their wealth, that nobody wants to stand up for their rights.
158 And when the 'poor' think that they will benefit from each dollar taken in taxes, that doesn't help any.  The
159 rich are taxed more because 'That's where the money is.'  
160     And the view expressed above that we'll have to learn to live with the current system helps even less, because that's
161 really just saying that we must learn to live with extortion, blackmail, and a diluted form of slavery.  I'd rather 
162 not learn to live with such things.

168 ADOPT A SALES TAX? HOW MANY OF THE WORKERS COULD AFFORD TO MOVE TO UTAH FOR 
169 RHTHOSE JOBS? YET HE CAN AFFORD TO MOVE HIMSELF BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO 
170 PAY HIS SHARE OF TAX IN OREGON. AFTER ALL THE STATE SUPPLIES HIM ROADS TO 
171 MOVE HIS PRODUCTS OVER, CLEAN (?) AIR TO BREATH, A BETTER THAN AVERAGE QU
172 QUALITY OF LIFE AS BEEN DOCUMENTEDD COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE NATION. YET 
173 HE IS GOING TO TAKE HIS TOYS AND GO ELSEWHERE AND WON'T PLAY WITH THE ES

197 To: UHF Bandit.    If you are who I think you are, please rember that
198 UHF signals run LINE-OF-SIGHT! We in Portland may not be "in range".
199 To: CYM     I tend to have mixed feelings on the subject of "the
200 rich" (or "corporations" or "christians" or "rajneshees"...)
201 The trouble with your example is that the MAJORITY wants the
202 money from taxing the corporation. The corporation feels that
203 the high taxes "make it unable to compete" due to increased costs.
204 Given the above feeling on the part of the corporation, what
205 do you expect it to do? Roll over & play dead? I have moved
206 because of rent increases, corporations move because of tax
207 increases. Unfortunately, most workers don't realize that taxes
208 (and wage & benefit increases!) can make an operation unprofitable.
209 Thus they ignore the situation until it is too late. I'm sorry
210 for the workers at the plant you mentioned, but UNDER CURRENT
211 LAWS & ECONOMIC "REALITIES" there isn't a whole lot else the
212 companies can do. I know "profit" is a dirty word these days
213 but profits are just as important to a company as your wages
214 are to you (actually as important as the amount by which your
215 wages exceed your bills). After all that is all a profit is,
216 the difference between income & outgo. 
217 To: DOM   I think it is just that they were on the character
218 generator chip. (tho the size of the Japanese market may have
219 had SOME influence). I do have LOWERCASE GREEK, also heart, 
220 spade, club,& diamond; "happy face" & "frown face" (alternate 
221 quickly for "pacman"); math symbols: <=, >=, capital Omega
222 radical (ie sqrt symbol), division (not slash), cap Sigma (ie SUM)
223 approx. =, cap. delta, integral sign (sort of), not eq., etc
224 Basically, a wide choice of chars (including some European chars that must be 
225 poked into memory).
226 ____________________________Leonard_________________________
227 Hrothgar,
228   I myself do not belong to any set of religion. I think that
229 the Rajneesies should be kicked out of the state of Oregon. Their
230 organization is threatening to the state of Oregon as well as
231 America itself. Bagwan is trying to get more and more followers.
232 After or if he gets them.. he will be strong enough to rule the
233 whole country. I think that that is what he's trying to do and
234 I think that Rajneespuram should be declared a religious camp
235 instead of a city... because a city it is not. A defenition
236 of a city is as follows:
237 
238    City: A small group of people living in a certain area that
239          allow visitors, newcomers and people who leave.
240 
241 Rajneespuram is not a free City. So, the above is my thoughts.

251 at this point.

257 More power to the Raj and his followers. They are doing something with
258 an area no-one else wanted, except those who mereley wanted it left as it
259 is, so they could play there. They are giving a lot of people at loose ends
260 something constuctive to do with their time, rather than sit around under
261 a streetlight and plan crimes. They plan to be self- supporting, not tax
262 supported, run (and pay for) their own school.
263    If the prior inhabitants of Antelope had thought ahead BEFORE it was
264 too late, they could have prevented the takeover (like write a land-use
265 plan), but "it couldn't happen here" and "we don't want another extra law
266 that might get in MY way". Too late. There was no plan aforehand to take
267 over Antelope, it was forced on them by those who tried to prevent their
268 building their own city.
269 Why is everybody afraid of them? Because they aren't Christian? Is it the
270 red shirts? Or maybe just because they are actually doing something?
271 Would the outcry be as loud if they were just another large developer 
272 building houses?
273 Have they ever hurt you?
274 (No. I am not one of them. Their 'religion' ain't.)

279 Well, at next glance, he was standing on the plate, annoyed because he

352 
353 Having a fairly intimate knowlege of Japanese society, culture and busi-
354 ness practices (for a hakujin), I would like to comment on such.
355 I have done some research on Japanese markets, both domestic and foreign,
356 and found several reasons for their superiority.  Some of these CYM has
357 already mentioned.  For example, involving the employees in the decision
358 making processes of the business is a practice which is just recently being
359 accepted by American companies.  Tektronix's Tek-circles is a half-hearted
360 example.  Another important difference, though, is the mechanics of this
361 decision making process.  That of Japanese manufacturers is extremely
362 (by American standards) slow and meticulous.  The american theory
363 of business is that by making business decisions rapidly, valuable man-
364 hours can be minimized in the planning phaze; and the best decision can be
365 found, more or less by trial and error.  (Again, Tektronix may be cited
366 as an example.)  Japanese business philosophy, however, is that by care-
367 fully considering every possible aspect of a plan BEFORE its implementation,
368 they can be relatively sure of its success and eliminate any need for
369 trial and error; and therefore, wasted man-hours for unsuccessful imple-
370 mentations, defective products, constant employee retraining, etc.
371 Also the relationship between a Japanese employee and his employer is gen-
372 erally much closer than most American family relationships.  The welfare
373 of the company is the foremost endeavor of the employee, partly due
374 to loyalty and partly due to the fact that he would have extreme difficulty
375 securing another job should his present one end.  
376 Although it pertains mostly to the domestic markets, another factor is
377 the attitude toward customers.  Americans seem to have forgotten that 
378 the person who pays the wages is the customer.  I can't recall the last
379 time I heard a sincere "Thank You" from a department store clerk (but
380 I think it was 1962).  Doing business is considerably more pleasant when
381 there is genuine appreciation for your business.
382 It is rapidly approaching 4:00am sooo.........to be continued.

388 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE JAPS HAVE A VERY WORKABLE SYSTEM AND PROVE IT 
389 EVERY DAY THAT THEY ARE  BUSINESS ITS PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE IGRAINED
390 INGRAINED RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IS INSTILLED FROM CHILDHOOD.  ON THE OTHER 
391 SIDE OF THE WORLD WHERE EURO-AMERICAN PRACTICES DOMINATE THE THINKING OF
392 THOSE WHO MAKE THE DAILY BUSINESS DECISSIONS THE RESULTS ARE CATASTROPHIC
393 ESPECIALLY SINCE THE ARABS GOT INO THE ACT.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EURO-
394 AMERICAN APPROACH IS TO CONDUCT EACH DAILY BUSINESS DECISISION WITH THE 
395 STRIP MINING MENTALITY OR ANOTHER WAY TO SAY IT MIGHT BE THE BUFFALO HIDE
396 MENTALITY WHICH ALL WHO ARE AWARE OF THE GRERAT PLUNDERS OF HISTORY WILL
397 RECOGNIZE.  EXCUSE THE TYPOS IM IN A HURRY WHAT DO YOU THINK?

423 THOSE EX-LIBERALS WHO SWITCHED SIDES IN '80 AND HELPED ELECT REAGAN. THIS
424 WAS BECAUSE OF THE WIDESPREAD MEDIOCRITY AND INTELLECTUAL BANKRUPTCY OF

430 AND HAVE A BUDGET DEFICIT SO HIGH IT'S INCOMPREHENSIBLE. WE'VE GOT HIGHER
431 UNEMPLOYMENT THAN MANY YEARS DURING THE DEPRESSION. SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE
432 LOST MORE GROUND THAN THEY HAD PICKED UP OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS, TEACHING
433 ME THAT WHAT THEY MEANT BY HELPING BUSINESS WAS JUST MEANT TO BE BIG BIG
434 BUSINESS. AND TO BIG BUSINESS, SMALL BUSINESSMEN LIKE MYSELF ARE DEFINED
435 AS OBSTACLES. 
436 
437 NECESSARY GOVERNMENT SERVICES HAVE DETERIORATED BADLY. FOR INSTANCE, THERE
438 WERE NO AIR ACCIDENTS OR HIGHJACKINGS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE CARTER 
439 ADMINISTRATION. IN THE LAST YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN TWENTY! THIS IS DUE
440 ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE LACK OF SAFETY ENFORCEMENT, BUDGET CUTS, INEXPERIENCED
441 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS, ETC THAT ARE RESULTS OF REAGAN POLICY.
442 
443 SO IT HASN'T WORKED OUT TOO WELL FOR THOSE THINGS THAT I VALUE LATELY. ALSO
444 I'M THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF MY LIBERAL FRIENDS. 
445 
446 SOMEDAY I WILL LEARN NOT TO BELIEVE IN POLITICIANS. ALSO NOT TO MAKE HASTY
447 DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH POLITICAL THEORIES HAVE MORE VALUE. IT IS STILL
448 TRUE, I BELIEVE, THAT LIBERALS AND THE LEFT IN GENERAL HAVE NO NEW IDEAS.
449 EVEN AFTER FOUR YEARS OF REAGAN, NOTHING SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING THERE. BUT
450 I'LL PROBABLY VOTE DEMOCRATIC THIS TIME. THE LEFT MAY BE INTELLECTUALLY
451 BANKRUPT, BUT AT LEAST IT'S NOT MALIGNANT, LIKE THE REAGANS, THE FALWELLS,
452 THE CASEYS, THE WATTS, THE BURFORDS, THE KISSINGERS, THE AL HAIGS (SAY, THATS
453 ANOTHER RESIGNATION THIS ADMINISTRATION)

455 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HROTHGAR, THE COCKEYED OPTIMIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
456 B.A.D,
457   Ok... think of it this way. If you lived in a small city of
458 about 12 people and someone put an apartment up, would you
459 be annoyed that it is there? Now, If a religious cult moved
460 into the same area with intentions on taking over the place,
461 would you be annoyed then? There's the difference.... It's not
462 because they belong to any group or religon, it's their
463 intentions that get me.
464   Notice how the Rajneeshies took over a SMALL town? Why didn't
465 they go for something bigger like Bend or John Day? They are
466 both small towns also. What I'm worried about is that those
467 little suckers will spread all over the state: conquering town
468 after town until finally oregon isn't green any more. I live in
469 a VERY small town... only about 3 businesses and a school...
470 that's the downtown. All of my friends and their parents are
471 worried that they will decide that Corbett is a pushover and
472 TRY to take it over. That is if they can! They'll get a lot of
473 static if they even enter or attempt to take it over. What I'm
474 saying is that they are fine where they are... If they don't
475 move, thats fine. If they move... More red to them. I listened
476 on talk radio KMJK last Saturday and they were talking to the
477 Mayor of Rajneeshpuram. One man asked:
478 "Would you support America in a war or a money crisis?"
479 the mayor replied:
480 "That's up to the people... that's their decision. I myself
481  would not."
482 Now doesn't that get your goat?
483 Another question was:
484 "Do you plan to inhabit other areas of Oregon?"
485 (a nice way of putting "Are you gonna take over any more towns?")
486 The reply was:
487 "At the present moment, Rajneeshpuram is still in it's development
488  stages. We will eventually go from town to town and eventually
489  take over Oregon."
490 THAT'S what got me mad. Keep the mail coming.... It's interesting.

499    THE RAJNEESPURAM IS SMALL TIME COMPARED TO ROY MASTERS MOVEMENT
500 IN GRANTS PASS.  HE PLANS ON HAvING 1,6,000 OF HIS FOLLOWERS 
501 MOVE TO GRANTS PASS 8(POP. 15,000).  TALKING ABOUT A TAKE OVER!
502 ONE GOOD THING HAS BECOME OF THIS, THE CITIZENS OF GRANTS
503 PASS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO FIGHT THIS INVASION. THESE TAKE OVERS
504 OF SMALL TOWNS MUST STOP, THIS IS ONE THING THAT EvERYBODy
505 CAN AGREE _ON!

544 up on upload.  Does it send CTRL-S or CTRL-Q?

560 One other factor contributing to Japanese  (NOT "JAP") industrial
561 superiority is that american manufacturers strive to develop
562 products with every feature  the consumer could possibly want.  It
563 is an unfortunate consequence that few can afford such luxury and for eco-
564 nomic reasons purchase the more functional, less expensive and more re-
565 liable Japanese models.  
566 
567 Hrothgar:  Indeed the subject has changed (from religion).  It seems that
568 Leonard has abandoned ship and swum off in another direction; and I have
569 still seen no signs of "d", perhaps he has gone down with the ship.  I be-
570 lieve us heathens have emerged from the debate victorious.  (Let's see
571 if that will elicit a response.)
572 
573 Tron:  Is that second quote of the mayor of Rajneeshpuram a direct, word-
574 for-word quote??  It seems unlikely that he would verbalize it even if it
575 were the case.

589 Hello.  I'm Cosmo and I'm new around here.  Looks interesting.  I read what 
594 you all say but, letos give it somemore discussion.               I think
595 Ronnie Reagan has been good for us and so has Watt... His only rea
596  problem is he is a P.R. slob.  As for the Japanese, they're just
597 doing what come natural to all 'capitalist' societies- they're
598 transforming they're natural resources into cash to live on.  They're a
599 n island with an underabundance of everything except people and fish.
600 A strong economy requires a business climate condusive to investment /
601  profit opportunities.  Let's keep he ratio to a reasonable level by
602 controlling excess profits but lets not handicap our business segment 
603 by taxing their end-line consumers until they can't afford to participat
604 e in the market place.  No business, no jobs.  No tax generatig workers
605 , no money for the social programs.  No social programs, the cry goes out
606 - more money.  More taxes.  Less business.  Cheaper prices.  Smaller
607 profits... ad infinitum.  
609 We need business.  Business needs a work force, the work force needs
610 to work (transform) the nations material resources.  We need develoment
611 , we need popular support and prevaling common sense and reasoned
612 thought.  Should we tax the churches and the businesses owned by the
613 churches.  I believe we should.  As for
615 Capital investment in the defense of the nation and its international 
616 interests seems just plain sense.  We defend the panama canal, the sea
620 and air lanes, against economically disastorous disruptions.  Think of the
621 satellite systems which are carryin a larger and larger percentge of the
622 information traffic of this, and oter countries.  Communications, 
623 meteorology, earth resource managment, defense,research, etc.
624 Our economy's life-blood is flowing through those systems.  Is defense
625 of these systems not valid?  Then any ol' Mohaummar
626 Kadahfi can throw up a stock atmospheric sounding rocket with a
627 100 kilogram payload of six-penny nails and detonate it across th
628 path of an oncoming satellite and completely strip it of externa
629 protuberences.  More Later.  Cosmo./////////Mikey....where are you???  DOM
