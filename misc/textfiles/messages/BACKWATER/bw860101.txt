39 attempts are easily detected by the laughable attempts at using Level 4

51 classes resume.
52 innocent bysitter: so I couldn't think up any names... I did figure that
53   you, if anyone, would catch on.  Next time, wait for the others before

56 Emu: sorry if I spoiled your fun.  I make it a habit to check strange names
57 in stories, ever since I read Sorcerer's World (by Damien Broderick), and
58 the "hero's" name was Yriah Eloh Esra.  There were other such names, too,
59 so regretfully, you were not quite original.  Nonetheless, it seems a well-
60 written tale so far.  Prithee continue.

64 what happened to my message?  Boy some welcome to  Portland I get...
65 Ya see, I've never been lucky enough, coming from a small town in New 
66 Jersey, to have all this great fun with computers.  Gee whiz what a crazy
67 bunch of people to have a billboaard on a computer.  Well now I'm just 
68 rambling on, but I have noticed that a lot of people do.  Some pretty 
69 interesting stuff...They have just asked if they will ever be able 
70 to pry me away from this darn computer...never ever ever,,, I've 
71 become obssessed.  I'll never leave here,I'll just keep typing til the day
72 I die.  Oh well...Anyway, it's kinda annoying when you try to call
73 somewhere and it's busy...so I guess I'll go and give someone else a 
74 chance to ramble on as I have.  See Ya Later....

76 Well, hello hello!  Yes, I'm trapped
77 on this piece of trash known as the

79 my computer shows.  Oh well, that's
80 the way it goes when you're a hacker
81 that lives poor in the backwater of
82 Forest Grove.  All condolences are 
83 accepted.  So, there isn't much to

86 they'll be busy.  Oh well.....

120    It was a quiet afternoon at the Hysterisis Bar, five klicks from the Vega stargate. The bar was frequented mostly
121 by Vegans, which could pass for earth humans or Kadanites as long as you didn't X-ray them. Right now, though, the
122 place was almost empty.
123    The slid into the wall to reveal a tall, skinny young man. He walked in tiredly and sat painfully at a table near
124 the door. After about a minute the bartender came out from behind the counter and walked over to him. "Mandell! I
125 thought it was you. I haven't seen you around here for a long time."
126    "Hello, Mak." he sighed. "Just got in. Gonna head out tonight."
127    Mak caught the pain in James' voice. Vegans have strong empathic skills. "What's the matter? You're hurting. I can
128 feel it from here."
129    "Just a few problems. Nothing 240 grains of copper-jacketed lead wouldn't cure. Or some poison. Howsabout fixing me
130 a Fusion Fizzle?"
131    Mak shook his head. "Your funeral, man." he went off to fix the drink. He brought it in a lead-lined, steel cup
132 with a pressure lid. Before he left, he said, "You feel like you want to talk about it, let me know, okay?"
133    "Sure." James said shortly. With his powers, he didn't dare get drunk for fear of losing control and hurting
134 someone that he didn't want to hurt. He was still relatively weak, though, so there was little danger of that. Soon he
135 was quite crocked but he didn't feel any better. In fact, he felt worse. And he was definitely gonna puke soon. He
136 suddenly remembered that that was why he didn't like to drink.
137    Then somebody laid a hand on his shoulder. Real or imagined? Who cared? He looked up unsteadily into a face with
138 three eyes. A grey box lay below the alien's chin, and when it spoke in its own incomprehensable dialect, the box
139 translated. Somewhat. It made for a facinating effect to the more than slightly drunk James. "yOU ArE thE
140 DEstrOyEr?"
141    James looked around. This weirdo had friends. Lots of them. Actually, there were only half as many as he saw. He
142 was definitely drunk. "No. I'm just a dock worker getting fortified for my shift. What are you?"
143    The alien ignored this. "iIi thInk yOU ArE thE DEstrOyEr. yoU ArE InjUrEd AnD dEfEnslEss rIght nOw. iIi hAvE wAItEd
144 fOr thIs OppOrtUnIty fOr A lOng..."
145    He would have had a hard enough time understanding the alien if he were sober. What he heard now was mostly
146 incoherent but he was getting the general idea. He reached under his jacket and whipped out a .44 Mag Smith. "I'm not
147 in a very good mood right now. Give me any crap and I'll give you a third, uh, fourth eye." He held the gun unsteadily
148 on the alien's face (one of them), right between the eyes. All three (six?) of them.
149    Aside from seeing double, James' mind was about ten percent functional at that time. He had honestly forgotten that
150 there was more than one of them. He recieved a reminder in the form of a steel bar applied liberally to the back of
151 his skull. The gun fell from already numb fingers and clattered on the floor. The entire world dissolved in a double
152 shower of stars and he was out cold before he hit the floor.

155   The sounds of revelry broke through the piper's self-absorbtion.  Nearly 
156 half of the Innhabitants were joyously celebrating the advent of the Terran
157 new year, while others looked on in incomprehension.  A soft whisper reached
158 his ear.
159   "What do they celebrate?  What bonds do they reinforce?"
160   Looking about, the piper was unable to discern the speaker, and so replied
161 aloud in a soft voice.
162   "They celebrate the counting of a new year in one of the Terrestrial c
163 cultures.  A large porportion of the inngoers have ties to a culture that
164 usually ends a year in a state of intoxication -- under the impression that
165 it is necessary to erase reality to have 'fun'."
166   "How unique!" came the whispered reply.  "And this explains their racous
167 behaviour?  Is there more to this custom?"
168   "Yes," answered the piper.  "Many also take this time to review their lives
169 for the past year, and make solemn resolves to improve themselves during the
170 next year.  These 'New Year's Resolutions' often last as long as two or three
171 weeks, during which the resolver makes himself and others around him 
172 miserable by the display of virtue he exhibits."
173   "How charming!" came the soft whisper.  Then, seeming from a great 
174 distance, "Do you not have a resolve to make?"

182 .....  Jenny had an absolutely radiant smile, the kind that makes you happy
183 just looking at her.  Allen stood up to greet her.  She dropped her bag and
184 they held each other tight.
185      "How have you been?  I haven't seen you for quite some time."
186      "Oh, I've been around.  It's kind of hard to find the time to get
187 everything done these days," she said.  "But I do try to keep in touch."
188      "Then I'm honored!" remarked Allen facetiously.
189      "Be still, you know what I meant.  I just thought that I'd stop by on
190 my way home from the library.  And since your house just happens to be on
191 the way I decided to drop in."
192      "On the way?  I live six blocks in the wrong direction for you to have
193 been going home," he corrected.
194      "Would you be quiet!  You're ruining my excuses," she said as she
195 began to beat on his chest with her fists.  "Besides, I wanted to give you
196 something."  She left him to retrieve her bag.  From it she removed a paper
197 sack and handed it to him.  "Happy seventh day of Christmas Snoopy."
198      "What's this, a gaggle of swans?" he mused.  As she handed him the
199 sack the paper tore.  He was surprised as to its contents.  "Hey, haven't I
200 seen this stuff before Jen?  Weren't these up..."
201      "Up in the attic, over my room," she finished.  "Yup, I'd noticed you
202 looking over some of the old stuff."  Allen fingers carefully traced the
203 lines that embossed the cover of the book that was held within the bag, his
204 eyes were glued to it.  "Thought I'd dump some of on you.  Do you like it?"
205      "Dump?  Jen, I think you've really missed the mark on that one.  A
206 sacrifice would be a better word."  His eyes lifted to see hers.  After a
207 moment they dropped back to the book and the sack he held.  "And this.  Why
208 did you bring this along too?" he asked.  Jenny was silent.

213 John Slivermen;
214 ou  were  on NONAME looking for a author of a story.  Well I  am 
215 sorry  that my story was purged from this system  so  fast.  they 
216  have thought it obscenity.  In a "Newsweek" article, Memphis 
217 osecutor Larry Parrish brilliantly stated, "There is absolutely 
218 no question that there is such a thing as obscenity.  The Supreme 
219 Court  has  said that there is and Congress has said  that  there 
220 ."  I realize it's hard to contain your laughter,  but  honest, 
221 that's a verbatim quote. What's your preference, "Deep Throat" or 
222 war?  Mr. Parrish evidently believes that Deep Throat is abscene; 
223 meone  else  might  think it's obscene for  the  Government  to 
224 enslave  an  individual and force him into a situation  where  he 
225 must  either  murder strangers or be  murdered  himself.  [called 
226 afted into the armed forces and given the opportunity to defend 
227 your country] Is this called the eye of the beholder?
228      The  people  and  sysop on this board have agreed  with  Mr. 
229 rish.  But as an author I can not help but try and reach  some 
230 motion  in  my reader. and it sounds as if I may have, And  what 
231 stronger emotion then sex. Better Yet,forbiden sex.  
232      Maybe  that  answered some of your Questions,  I do hope  it 
233 e some think as least.....and last but not least..............

238 very interesting...Im starting to actually look forwards to
239 these stories...Hmmmmm
240 "electric look, electric blue, keep one dream that won"t come
241 true..."
242 557:
243 Ah, the obscenity debate. Words of argument just so you can print words about
244 sex. And wherefore does the entertainment value come from such a piece? The
245 titillation factor of course, and sometimes the thrill of danger, of writing
246 (and then reading) words that have often not been allowed.
247 No, yours is not some piece of art, exploring worlds which need to be explored
248 on a system used by young and old, family people and others.
249 'Readers Digest' wouldn't print a story about two people having sex in explicit
250 detail, it belongs in 'Playboy'. And just as so, your story doesn't belong
251 here, especially considering the fact that there are so many so-called 'adult'
252 or 'free' boards where that kind of writing is desired.
253 Your purpose is only to entertain by way of sexual arousal. While we needn't
254 debate as to whether that itself is obscene or not, you must consider the
255 forum in which it's presented. In my opinion, this is not the proper forum
256 for it. Mikey, keep editing... and thanks for doing so... but since this first
257 entry is not (yet) to the 'bad' parts, perhaps you could leave it to spark some
258 debate and further comments?

276    If we deny the existance of the autonomous systems, imagining that we 
277 hace got rid of them by a critique of the name, then their effect which
278 nevertheless continues cannot be understood, and they can no longer be
279 assimilated to consciousness. Then they become an inexplicable factor of
280 disturbance which we finally assume must exist somewhere or other outside
281 of ourselves. In this way, a projection of the autonomous systems results,
282 and at the same time, a dangerous situation is created, because the 
283 disturbing effects are now attributed to bad will outside ourselves which
284 of course is not to be found anywhere but at our neighbor's-de l'autre 
285 cote' de la riviere. This leads to collective delusions, political
286 'incidents,' and revolution, in a word, to destructive mass psychoses.

290 One Long Saturday...
291     (Part 5)
292     
293      Moments later six dripping aliens stood in front of him. In that same annoying matter-of-fact voice, Amogo
294 explained, "A refreshingly uneventful experience. It was fortunate that our lungs easily convert to breathing liquids.
295 We saw very little water life, though."
296      Jim groaned and buried his face in his hands. After regaining his composure he led them to a spot in the far
297 corner of his property, as far from the house as possible. There was a small drum with two wires running from it and
298 some towels on top. He handed them each a towel and said, "Dry yourselves off. Uh, wait here. I'll be right back. I
299 just remembered my lunch is sitting in the oven."
300      Trying not to appear too anxious, he walked back towards the house. This was his last hope. The wires ran across
301 the field all the way over to his car. Instead of going clear back to the house, he turned and walked to the car, where
302 the hood was up. One of the wires was hooked to the negative terminal of the battery. The other lay on the ground. He
303 picked it up.
304      Jim was an avid black powder shooter. That drum contained his whole stock of black powder (about twenty pounds)
305 and a blasting cap, which the wires were attached to. From here Jim could just see that the aliens were patiently
306 waiting around the drum, like he asked. He just hoped the current would still be strong enough to set off the cap after
307 travelling through all that wire. Crouching low behind the fender, he touched the other wire to the positive
308 terminal.
309      He needn't have worried. First there was a flash that nearly blinded him. Then the ground shook as if God himself
310 had stamped down on upon the earth. A split-second later came a huge BOOM! that almost split his eardrums. They must
311 have heard that for miles. Hopefuly it won't bring the cops way out here. Jim came out of hiding and walked towards a
312 dissipating seventy foot mushroom cloud.
313      All that was left was a smoking crater of respectable size. No aliens. He'd  blown 'em to smithereens. Finally! He
314 allowed himself a relieved sigh when he realized it was all over.
315      And sucked that sigh back in when he heard grass crunching from behind. Spinning on his heel, he saw a blackened
316 alien walking up to him, a little unsteadily. Looking around, he saw another one about twenty yards away coming from a
317 different direction. It took almost half an hour, but eventually they all found their way back.
318      Surrounded by six diminuative aliens staring at him accusingly, the only thing left he could think of doing was
319 breaking down and crying. He was out of ideas. He was doomed.
320      And so was the earth.

363 As the door to the Inn opened, a friendly individual walked quietly in and
364 shut the door.  As he looked around the Inn, he found the usual amount of
365 Inngoers taking in the seasons delights.  Suddenly, a large, friendly fellow
366 with long ponytail type hair jumped up and charged toward the man at the
367 door.  "PaPa Smurf!!" he exclaimed, "How have you been."  Most of the
368 people turned to take note of the individual (wearing a blue shirt, blue
369 pants and blue shoes) that looked alot like a 'man in blue' but who was
370 really, PaPa Smurf.   "Well, Leonard", PaPa began "my story style maybe
371 just the same, but I'm really glad to have stopped by."  "After a week
372 like this one, my, oh, me."   "Tell me more", Leonard prompted.  "Well,
373 I have had encounters with a Vegan, the strong empathic skills type.  I
374 should see if Mandell knows him.  Hmmmm.  Ah, it was generally a very
375 interesting New Year's.  Let's sit down and chat a few."  So PaPa and
376 Leonard sit a chat.  The Inn seemed not to change much at all since the
377 last visit.  Nice debates about obscenity and old references to FRANK
378 being drawn up again from the deeps of the cellar.  Frankenstupe putting
379 in his two cents (2 pennies that I agree with).  And a Doctor Who
380 reference that looked interesting.  Hmmmm, yes the Inn does continue one
381 now then doesn't it.  "It does indeed", says Leonard.   "Well I must
382 be going, sleep awaits.  Hope to see you all again sometime, and may the
383 blessing be with each and everyone one of you."  The blue man walked to
384 the door and closed it behind him.  Some woundered how long he would be
385 gone this time, but everyone knew that he was indeed still alive, and
386 always fond of the Inn.

403 of a blue-clad man who talked briefly with some old cronies and left.  He
404 still knew nothing of who authored the whisper; his attempts to find him or
405 her had failed.  Did he, indeed, stand in need of a "new year's resolve?"
406 He suspected that he did, but was unsure of what it should be.

409 ANYONE OUT THERE INTERESTED IN A GAY CBBS?
410 @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@too tired to keep tapping...
411 
412 Hey! I think we've got a great ol' gay BBS right here! Everyone is so happy
413 all the time, most of the comments are positive and based on learned material
414 (often recently, allowing for the fact that there seems to be many college
415 students bounding in and out), and everyone indeed already has a gay old time!
416 So sit back and enjoy it! Be happy! Be gay! Why look elsewhere!
417 
418 ...
419 Mr. Silverman, since you keep peeking in and out, presumably interested in what
420 others have to say about your story, as we all are when we write but it is
421 seldom obliged unless it totters on either the brink of genius or the brink of
422 completely inaninity (is that a word? Inane, inanity? Could be...) so I will
423 offer my words to oblige you thereof and because although I don't believe your
424 story totters on the brink of genius it is certainly, without a doubt, one of
425 the few stories I can actually find myself smiling at when it begins,  and just
426 as much so by the end.
427 Hope you can keep it up, paradise would be if it would stay amusing, but reality
428 tells us the fun wears off after a bit (ref: Destroyer) and gets tedious, if
429 you can wander on that fine line and wrap it up sometime in the distant future
430 with a sock 'em up ending this deserves,
431 why, I'll just be so gay!

454         The chrome and black car sped through the fog and over the asphalt.
455 The man on the running board lept off as the car sped away.
456         His shoes touched the wet cement.  He slipped as his shoes skidded
457 across the wet sidewalk.
458         He regained his balance and straightened himself.  Testing the grip of
459 his shoes, he walked on.  Still straightening his tie.
460         The shoes made little noise as he ran up the stairs.  The red carpet
461 disappeared behind him and a dark marble floor took it's place.
462         "Table for two,"  Murmered the man with wet shoes.
463         "Will you be waiting long?"  Inquired the oriental concierge.
464         "I said, 'For two',"  Demanded the man slipping a ten spot over to the
465 conciierge.
466         The guy in the tux led the way to a small table, over another red
467 carpet.  The top of the table was black marble and trimmed in gold.  Even the
468 red candle fit into the color scheme.
469         "What?  You want more money?"
470         The guy in the tux stopped smiling and turned on his heel, walking off
471 the carpet, his heels now clicking on the marble.
472         "Lousy son of a,"  He stopped to select a cigarette from his silver
473 case.  Without lighting it, he put it in his mouth, then continued to curse,
474 tucking the case slyly into his breast pocket.
475         His eyes surveyed the crowd.  They all ate strangely.  A pair of girls
476 tried to use chopsticks, their mother tried to stop them.  One old man was
477 staring at the girls, stabbing his cheek with his fork.  A youngg man was
478 staring at the mother, a pepper dangling stupidly from his mouth.
479         His eyes caught one of th girls.  She stared at him.  He gglanced away
480 but found himself staring back.  How old could she be?
481         "Down boy,"  Said a woman, arrannging herself at the table.  Her purse
482 in front of her, her boxes off to the left and right.
483         "Anyone ever call you a perfectionist?"  He asked sarcasticly,
484 forgetting the girl, now appraising the woman.  How old could this one be?
485         She wore a low cut dress and a fur over her shoulders, which she pulled
486 across her shoulders and tucked away in one of her boxes.
487         "I said 'Down boy', not 'Beg',"  She said as cynically as he had ever
488 heard anyone say anything.  Is she as cold inside as it is outside?
489         "Right,"  He matched her cynicism.  "Why'd we have to met so damned
490 early in the morning?"
491         "I'm paying, that's why,"
492         "Right,"  He was willing to bet she was that cold inside.  "So, talk,"

557 RE: THE DESTROYER
558  
559 I READ WHAT "TSSC" SAID EARLIER ABOUT SAID STORY AND AUTHOR AND JUST WANTED
560 TO SAY THAT I AGREE COMPLETELY. I HAVE BEEN ON THIS BOARD SINCE BEFORE HE
561 BEGUN THAT TURKEY AND WHILE IT WAS WELL WRITTIN AND INTERSTING AT THE BEGINNING
562 IT HAS SINCE DEGENERATED TO A BORING, TEDIOUS MESS. I AM SURE OTHER'S AGRE WITH
563 ME AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SHOWING OF HANDS:
564 HOW MANY THINK THE DESTROYER SHOUD EITHER END OR SIMPLY TERMINATE HIS STORY?
565 I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING BUT HE IS TAKING VALUABLE SPACE THAT OTHER, MORE INTER
566 ESTING WRITIERS COULD BE USING. WRITERS LIKE EMU AND PIPER, TO NAME A COUPLE.
567 LET'S SHOW MR. D WHAT WE ALL THINK AND MAYBE HE WILL TAKE A HINT AND A POWDER.

570 Well, let's not be so harsh... at least we could say it nicely. He's been try-
571 ing hard and has after all provided at least a partial time of good reading.
572 The message should not be "get lost!", it should be, "hey guy, we've liked your
573 writing, but, either a little spice or something new, we're not excited anymore!
574 Oh, what a fickle public we are...
575 Political debate? Sounds good to me! Obscenity, creation and AIDS debates are 
576 too hashed and rehashed. That's what we need, a good political debate. My guess
577 is that most of these college whiz kids out there have learned to be pretty
578 liberal from their teachers (the ones who can't make it in the free enterprise
579 system, so they become teachers and condemn it), so I'll take the conservative
580 point of view. We're near the bottom here, so on the next disk, let's get one
581 started. Like, why we should let South Africa work out its own problems and we
582 should stay out of it, or Star Wars or
583 whatever. We need some fierce dialogue
584 to start the new year!!!!

604 TED: Actually, I haven't said anything on this disk. There was only one
605 line of comment, and that was the editorial remark in the indicated message
606 that I removed. Perhaps you confused someone else with me, many people
607 use the "**" seperation border, so just seeing it doesn't mean that I
608 left the message. I have only two characters on this system, The Innkeeper,
609 and CISTOP MIKEY. Both of which I always sign the name within the bottom
610 border (see below). Normally I would remove all references to said message,
611 but I felt it had merit enough in the opening argument that I decided to
612 at least leave that. And, there certainly were a lot of people interested
613 given by the response on this disk. At least the individual seems to have
614 gotten what he was after, attention. Personally I don't care about the 
615 existance of such writing, but, it belongs in its proper place, and that 
616 place is not here as is clearly spelled out at the top of each disk (not
617 that anybody READS the thing). As for the individual, he was writing for
618 himself, not anyone else. If he had truly been interested in the people
619 he was writting for, he would have first determined what they liked or
620 objected to. Not that that in itself is good or bad, having something that 
621 is objected too be written can be good as it stirs up the old brain cells,
622 but a person shouldn't get all upset when others express their dislike. 
623 As for first amendment rights, as the old saying goes, your rights stop 
624 where my property line starts. When you are a guest, you play by their rules
625 and you shouldn't be surprised or offended that you are asked to leave when
626 you don't play by those rules.
627 Hmmm, it looks like I went and rambled on about the subject anyway doesn't
628 it? Oh well, someone had to fill the disk up!
