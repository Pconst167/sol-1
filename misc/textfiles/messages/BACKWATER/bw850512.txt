26 ====================================================================
27      The plane shook as it desended for a landing. I got up and streched
28 as I could to try to get the creak out of my bones. I was greeted with a
29 large 'bump' as the plane touched down. 
30      Some minutes later the plane had taxied to a stop, and I could hear the
31 ground crew going about their business. Then the cargo hatch opened, flooding
32 in the bright sunlight and blinding me for a moment. It was soon followed
33 by a waft of warm humid air. "HUMID?!" This obviously can't be Albainia!
34 The ground crew spoke English, but that ment nothing, as they were probably
35 imported anyway. Finally my chance came, and I scrambled out of the hatch.
36 Quickly taking stock of the stiuation, I ran for cover behind a bagage truck.
37 This afforded me a little time to try to find out where I was. Looking about,
38 I finally saw a sign on a nearby wall. Reo?! Oh lord! They switched to 
39 South America. What is going on here anyway?! Just then I heard some voices
40 turning, I saw two slovenly men carrying/dragging a slightly crumpled young
41 woman. She was either very tired, very drunk, or drugged. I assumed the
42 later, for a moment, she raised her head, and for what appeared to be a 
43 moment of lucicity, she looked in my direction. There was eye contact, then
44 she blinked as if not understanding it all, and then lasped into a semi-
45 comotose state again, slack jawed and drool slowly oozing down her chin.
46 This must be Pam I thought. I wonder where they are taking her?
47     They moved towards the building, and slipped in a door. I quickly check to 
48 make sure that no one was watching, then sprinted across the open area towards
49 the door. Just as I almost reached it, I heard a shout. "Hey! Stop! Where
50 do you think you're going?" Quickly followed by a bullet whizzing past my
51 head and striking the cement wall. I quickly ducked inside the door, only
52 to come face to face with the two apes that had been carrying Pam. I saw
53 Pam sitting staring into space on a chair against the wall. The ape with
54 the missing front teeth spoke, "Well now, what have we here? Somone interested
55 in the little lady eh? Have a nice flight? Maybe you'd like to rest a bit,
56 Ya know jet lag can cause one to get tired sooo easily. The other ape quickly
57 grabbed me in a hammerlock, While Mr. toothless reach into a bag grinning.
58 I felt the sharp prick of a needle entering my arm, and heard the sickening
59 laugh from Mr. toothless as I began to slip into darkness. Is this the end
60 I thought? To go blindly rushing after something I didn't even know what it
61 was about? How could I be so foolish? But I'll get out of this mess and
62 maybe even rescue the broad if I can (assuming she needs rescuing). I just
63 hope I can stay alive long enough to do it. The darkness came quickly,
64 with sight of toothless standing over me his ugly laugh echoing in my ears.
65 framed between his legs I could see Pam still slumped over, twitching now and 
66 then, the only evidence of life. 'somehow' I thought, 'somehow' as a warm
67 happyness invaded my mind, and I began to uncontrollably giggle...

70      Sam was quite glad to be on the ground again.  He thought
71 himself lucky to be alive.  And he was right.  Not only had he
72 just missed being seen when the plane made it's refueling stop,
73 riding around in a plane's wheel-well is not exactly a very good
74 idea.  It was, in fact, a testimonial to NET's R&D department
75 that he survived at all.  Since there was no time to arrange any
76 form of alternate transportation, he had grabbed his NET agent
77 survival and safty equipment and hid in one of the wells.  After
78 donning the ear protectors and the eye goggles, Sam had done his
79 best to keep alive with the NASA-like space blanket and the
80 first-aid oxygen bottle.  The really hard part of the trip was
81 getting out of the well before being spotted by the ground crew.
82 He had made it, and had just made it into hidding before seeing
83 the driver of the other car he had been tailing in Portland get
84 out of the cargo compartment.  He thought of trying to signal
85 him, but before he could, he (the other driver) was captured as
86 well.  #Oh great# thought Sam.  #Now I've got *two* people I'll
87 have to keep track of and hopefully help escape.  I'd better get
88 in touch with NET HQ and see if they can get my car down here.
89 Where-ever "here" is...  And to think I thought this was going
90 to be a boring asignment!#.  With that thought, NET 67 shuffled
91 off to see if he could find a phone booth.

123 	Three black dogs played in the water.
124 	A dragon kite hung in the upper air.
125 	From the lake rose many snakes.
126 	Thunderclouds sped by, lumpy, blue.
127 	Noah caulked his Ark for the coming flood.
128 	Sheets of ice in the mountains hung, transparent.

158 	How dear the life-givinh air
159 	Without it we are cold, blue.
160 	Our hopes hung brittle, transparent,

162 	Swimming has exhausted even the snakes.
163 	They fall slowly down through the water.
164 
165 	High in mountain air, beached by the receeding flood,
166 	Our bones lie blue shale, with those of snakes.
167 	Our blood thinned, transparent, flows in river water.

187 All: At the PorSFiS meeting two weeks ago, I heard someone say that they
188 actually knew all the words to "Louie, Louie".  Can anyone download that to

190 to make up our own words for lack of authentic ones.

193          It's my fragile protection, my fragile prison which secures me from 
194 the harshness around and inside of me. A crack runs through it, a lightning 
195 streak. A storm of angry souls thundering with unstoppable destruction
196 ravage across the dark sky. At first it was a mist that hung forlornly, 
197 waiting and stealing the hope from desperate people. The mist clouded, the
198 winds fluried, transforming into chaos, building momentum perpetuated by
199 scared people.
200           As if summoned from somewhere inside the great network of my brain,
201 from some divulged nucleus, lightning bursts forth from behind the clouds. 
202 A scintilla briefly flashes, illuminating each raindrop. Blazing a path
203 through the darkness, it brillantly dances in the gray sky.
204           The walls shatter, the broken glass shrieks, falling musically at my
205 side. There's a cry of pain from the glass and I as the rain drips teardrops
206 on my face.

268 UNDERCOVER (Part three)
269 by John Silverman
270 
271 He didn't know how many hours he had lain there, just listening. There
272 had been no noises for a long time. He finally decided that he was alone.
273 He jumped out of the basket. Stepping over the bodies (strange how he 
274 couldn't clearly see them.) he made his way to the door. Opening it, he 
275 looked out. Nobody around. He started running down the hallway. The halls
276 seemed to have become miles long and there were no doors in sight. Suddenly,
277 he knew he was being pursued. Not by gunmen in black masks, but by some-
278 thing infinitely worse. Every time he looked back, he saw nothing, but he
279 knew it was there. He could hear it.
280 
281 
282 From somewhere behind there was a moaning, filled with pain. Occasionally
283 it would rise to a scream. It called his name, begged for his help.
284 Somewhere up ahead was the main enterance. Double glass doors, framed 
285 with steel. If he could just reach them, he would be safe. Suddenly, just
286 he turned a corner, there they were. He could see sunlight outside through
287 them. Freedom was just steps away. He bore down on it, full throttle,
288 but his feet seemed to slow down as he closed in. That horrible voice 
289 was louder that ever. It was up ahead, now. He couldn't let that stop him
290 
291 
292 He almost made it. Just as his hand closed on the cold steel handle, 
293 another hand from nowhere grabbed his ankle. He unbalanced and fell 
294 headfirst into the plate glass door, shattereing it, feeling each sharp
295 piece slice into him...
296 
297 
298 "Jesus" He jolted awake and froze, just gradually becoming aware that he
299 had been dreaming. He was still in the cart, having awoke from one 
300 nightmare right into another. His heart and head were pounding. His mouth
301 felt like sandpaper. He was dehyddra-
302 ting. Finally he was awake enough to realize the voice from the dream was
303 still there.
304 
305 
306 "Helllpp... meee... "
307 
308 
309 The plea broke off in a string of weak, bubbling coughs. Awake, Frank knew
310 that voice. It was Chuck, a busboy. Tall, blond, and well muscled, the 
311 girls working there had competed for his attentions, which he readily gave
312 He was always bragging about some conquest or other he had made. He also
313 had a very volitile temper. It was pretty much an open secret that Chuck
314 had put two of his co-workers in the hospital, though nobody could prove
315 anything. Frank feared and hated him.
316 
317 
318 "I know you're in... there... help meee... " That voice wasn't frightening,
319 just pitiful. Evidently, the guard was gone at the moment, or it would
320 have been all over right there. 
321 
322 
323 The basket shook as a hand grabbed the edge. Chuck was trying to pull
324 himself in and his weight threatened to tip over the basket. Frank had to
325 do something. He reached out from the sheets and pried the hand loose.
326 The grip, which should have been much stronger than his, came away easily
327 and Chuck fell to the floor with a thump and a cry of pain. 
328 
329 
330 "You bas... bas... tard" The voice faded off, as if he were falling asleep
331 and then there was nothing but faint, raspy wheezing. Frank listened to
332 the wheezing for several minutes until it finally stopped. Chuck had been
333 a creep but he didn't deserve this. none of them had. Frank shut his eyes
334 and cried, bitterly and silently, as if he had just lost his best friend.
335 
336 
337 Somewhere far off, he imagined he could hear a ghost, cursing him.
338

363      Muttering, Salazar worked his way back to the tiny head at the rear
364 of the aircraft.  He entered and bracing himself against the sides of the
365 stall, took care of business.  Thoughts wandering, he idly glanced at the
366 wall before him.  Strange?  Graffiti on a Lear Jet?  He looked closer.
367                     Looking for a good time?
368                     When in Paraguay, Call Frieda
369                          FUrher? 0 - 2815
370      Hmmm... interesting.  Salazar pulled his notebook from his pocket and
371 wrote down the number.  It was either a clue or... er he's have to wait and
372 see.  Finished with the necessary task, Salazar moved to the washbasin.  
373 His thoughts turned to Anna.  Kinda cute, that one... but she went to great
374 lengths to hide it.  He wondered why.  Were there any possibilities there
375 for him?  She certainly would be a change from the women he was used to...
376 those women usually chased him.  He knew Anna wouldn't, not the type; but
377 then he didn't know if he wanted to get involved.  Anna wouldn't settle for
378 anything short term.  Long ago, Salazar had been burned by a couple of the
379 more domestic types.  He had avoided them ever since.  Too many scars.
380 Still, there was a certain attraction.  His mind drifting, Salazar wondered
381 where Wassir was... probably in trouble again.
382      "Mr. Salazar, you'll have to hurry.  We're about ready to make our
383 descent."  Anna's voice sounded from the other side of the door.
384      "Okay, I'm finished."  Salazar opened the door and started to make his
385 way back to his seat.  He stumbled slightly.  They had hit an air pocket.
386      As Salazar settled into his seat, Anna leaned over him.  "We'll be
387 landing in a moment, Mr. Salazar.  Let me check your seatbelt to see if 
388 it's fastened securely."
389      "No need, I can do it... Ulp!"  The jet lurched to the side--more
390 turbulance.
391      Anna lost her balance and tumbled into Salazar's lap.  Instinctively,
392 his arms went around her.  She tensed for a moment, then melted close to 
393 his body.  With his left hand, he could feel the play of muscles 'cross her
394 back.  The clean, fresh scent of her long hair quickened his blood.
395 Unbidden, Salazar's right hand moved up and caressed the warm, softness of
396 her cheek.  Anna's fingers clenched the fabric of his shirt.  For a
397 moment, they floated together in time...
398      "Folks, we'll be landing in approximately two minutes.  Please make 
399 sure all burning materials are extinguished."  
400      The captain's announcement broke the mood.  Anna pushed against 
401 Salazar's chest and stood up, red-faced.  "Mr. Salazar, in the future, I'd
402 appreciate it if you would keep your hands to yourself."
403      Salazar started to speak, then gave up.  Anything he could say would
404 only aggravate the situation.  Out of the corner of his eye, he watched
405 the young woman furiously tugging on her seat belt.  Attractive, but not as
406 cold as she wanted him to believe.  One more mystery to ponder.  The jet
407 jolted as they touched down.  Out of the window, Salazar could see the 
408 dense greenery of a South American jungle rushing past.  He knew he'd 
409 better get his mind back on the matter at hand.  In his business, lapses of
410 concentration could be fatal.
411      "Folks, please remain in your seats until we've come to a complete
412 stop,"  the captain said.  "No need to worry about Customs, Mr. Rommel
413 has handled that."  Outside, a long black limo awaited them.

450 
451      When it was built in 1881, the Webster building was the finest
452 example of cast iron architecture in the city.  With its five stories
453 replete with Mansard roof and tower, it remained the tallest structure
454 in the region for eight years, until architectural styles changed to
455 resolve design problems of high-rise buildings.  From the intricate,
456 ornate columns at the ground floor to the grandiose balconies of the
457 upper floors, the Webster embodied all the best that cast iron offered
458 of beauty and granduer in buildings.  A magnificent and imposing
459 structure for its time, the Webster housed the offices of the city's
460 most important commercial establishments.
461      However, in 1909, a disastrous fire destroyed its stately tower
462 and the floor behind the Mansard roof.  And now, in 1967, almost sixty
463 years later, the building was in a deplorable condition.  The upper
464 floors, condemned and unsuitable for occupation, were dark and
465 forbidding.  Only the ground floor remained occupied, housing a couple
466 of small shops near what had been the grand entrance to the building.
467 Slated for demolition later this year, the tired structure would not
468 benefit from the wave of preservation and restoration that would
469 sweep the city in less than ten years, an effort that would ultimately
470 save less than twenty of the more than two hundred structures
471 utilizing cast iron construction.
472      There was an odd similarity between the once stately structure
473 and the figure of the old man who stood swaying outside one of the
474 remaining shops, illuminated by the well-lit window, and staring
475 blurry-eyed at the merchandise within.  He clutched a half-empty
476 bottle of wine close to his chest with his left hand.  He was stooped
477 over as if he bore an enormous, invisible load on his back.  Many years
478 of pain and hard drinking had carved deep lines in his face, which
479 displayed a seemingly perpetual five-day growth of prickly gray beard.
480 His oversized flannel shirt was saturated with sweat and dried vommit,
481 and, inside his urine-stained, baggy wool pants, dried feces
482 clung like burrs.  The resulting stench caused would-be muggers to
483 think twice about their motives when they approached within range
484 of their foul-smelling prey.  Generally, they changed their mind and
485 left him alone...

497      Both shafts having since been removed were tied together and handed to
498 Wipunxit.  The Indian just looked at them with a very confused frown but
499 still handled them carefully before they were placed by his side.
500      The Guardian then made certain the cloak he had wrapped around the boy
501 was providing the warmth needed to fend off the chill that had attracted his
502 attention.  He tore at the cloak to attend to the boys wound.
503      "This is as difficult for me to explain as it must be for you to
504 comprehend, but I shall attempt to do so in any case."  He cleared his
505 throat and tried for another deep breath befor continuing.
506      "Not too many years ago did I realize the powers a mage could carry.
507 And that Edric had a great deal of it at his disposal.  Since he had made
508 your fathers aquaintance and had become a member of his entourage he was
509 able to advance his studies beyond simple spells and legerdemain.  He 
510 studied in diligence and for two years spoke to no one other than your 
511 father and the township's arch-mage.  As Castellan and protector to your
512 father, I was witness to many privated sessions that went late into the 
513 night between the two.  These sessions did not occur often, but at each 
514 one I would notice the difference in Edric.  He was aging.  Each month 
515 that passed saw more hairs of white and another wrinkle in his face.  It
516 is what brought the thoought to my mind.  'If he was to become powerful,'
517 I thought, 'could he not remove the effect his learning had brought 
518 about?'"  The Guardian rubbed his neck and shut his eyes for a moment as
519 he recalled the events that had happened.  "I would keep this a secret 
520 unto myself until such time when Edric was alone and was not deep into 
521 his tomes or his slumber...  Two more of these late night sessions would
522 adjourn before I had the time and opportunity available to speak with 
523 him.  By that time my question had changed, and he knew why it was that
524 I was coming for him.

530 L'homme: The check.. err DISK is in the mail. Also, can you give me a 
531 call sometime, I want to ask you a couple of questions about the
532 adventure games. For what it's worth, you CAN set COPYLINK to 56K baud.
533 I haven't actually checked the code time, so I don't know if it will
534 actually RUN there, but you can set it there. A page of new instructions/
535 instruction changes is being provided along with the new disk. No real
536 major changes, an error flag to let you know is a call was succesful.
537 (a little simpler then using a log string to return the information.)
538 Some modem control functions, a cursor position command. A parenthisis
539 now allowed in the arithmetic expressions. (actually, required in 
540 expression components with secondard parameters such as RND 19 before
541 you would enter RND 1 + 1 which it would translate to RND 2. Now it will
542 add 1 to the value returned by RND 1 so if you still want to use the
543 arithmetic equation, you must put in parens. RND ( 1 + 1 ) to get the
544 proper effect. This should reduce confusion in coding a bit.
545 How's the testing coming?
