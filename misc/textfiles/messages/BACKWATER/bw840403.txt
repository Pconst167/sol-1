Note: With this disk, the vandalism started to become a serious
problem. The entire group of original messages on this disk
had been deleted. The result was that BWMS was placed into 
protected mode. That means that once a line was entered in the

71 Deborah -- I still haven't gotten to back issues, but sometime!!!   L-5 is
72 one of the interesting points in the moon's orbit about the earth.  In the
73 erased messages, the bard explained it quite well, i'll try to repeat it as
74 best i can.  In the earth-moon system there exist 5 points where the gravity
75 of one is EXACTLY balanced by the gravity of the other.  These are the 
76 Lagrange points ... L-1 through L-5.  L-1, L-2, and L-3 are arranged on a
77 line through the centers of the earth and moon.  L-4 and L-5 are in the 
78 moon's orbit -- ahead and behind by 60 degrees.  If you think of the earth
79 and moon as being holes in a smooth surface, the gravitational forces around
80 sorry, depressions in a smooth surface -- the force of gravity is the 
81 depth of the depression.  L-1, L-2, and L-3 are the tops of hills.  If you
82 leave something there, it will continue to drift and move away from that
83 point.  L-4 and L-5 are at the bottom of wrinkles in the cosmic blanket.
84 They are points of positive stability and anything left near them will drift
85 into them.  This makes L-4 and L-5 desirable building points in space.
86   The L-5 society is dedicated to building a colony at the L-5 point.  They
87 have done exhoaustive research and planning on this and it is possible NOW!
88 The investment is enourmous -- and the payback even more so.  I'll try to
89 get you an address (any help from anyone?) so you can send for their 
90 information.  These are LARGE scale dreams!
91 Mikey -- even though I appreciate the necessety, it sure is hard not o be
92 able to go back and change mistooks in the previous line.  Oh well...

99 ...................................
100 Now I see why some people want less gun control, so next time the Inn
101 is zapped,,.....
102 Of course, stiff gun control would reduce the number of people hurt with
103 guns, since most of it is due to accidents; however it would have very
104 little effect on what people are afraid of: criminals using them. For
105 proof of the efficacy of gun control look at New York, which has one of
106 the stiffest gun control laws around, yet their crime rate using guns is
107 still rather high. (Except for murders commited "in heat of passion".)
108 Texas has a very high rate of murders using guns, but such things as
109 armed robberies aren't much more common, even if their gun control laws
110 are the most lax in the US. In London the crime rate using guns is
111 steadily rising, until even Bobbies now are often armed; this in the 
112 face of very stiff laws.
113    But let's admit it, the arguements about gun control have very little
114 to do with safety, and a lot to do with POWER, or more expilcitly, who 
115 will have it over another person. It is such a nice feeling to be able
116 to tell someone else what he MUST do. A gun is a symbol of power, and
117 being able to deny someone else the right to have one is power. All the
118 other arguements for gun control also imply the restriction of all
119 dangerous tools, or dangerous games, like cars, or worse car racing, or
120 maybe mountain climbing, or high school sports (which kill more people
121 than guns do), or ... But if enough people do it, even if logic says
122 otherwise, it is OK, or if it feeds our egos (like the local team 
123 winning) it is OK.

315 Ah yes - the constitution specifically enumerates the right of every 
316 idiot to own a gun. Let me dig out my copy. There we go, a little
317 dusty but none the worse for neglect. Of course you all have a copy
318 of your own, don't you, so you can just follow along. Here we are, 
319 the bill of rights. I think the second amendment is what we want.
320 Now, just in case someone doesn't have a copy, I'll quote from mine.
321 "A well regulated MILITIA, being necessary to the security of a free
322 State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
323 infringed." Caps mine, of course.
324     I can see that at a quick glance, especially if taken last in
325 the sixth grade, It would appear that our venerated founding fathers
326 had wished us to be able to indescrimanently own the firearm(s) of 
327 our choosing. But a literal interpretation, the kind the NRA loves
328 to espouse, ties the ownership of arms directly to an organized
329 militia. No where do I read that all citizens are guaranteed the
330 right to kill whomever they choose, or any othe interpretation 
331 equally as silly. And as to the earlier comment that cars should
332 be outlawed, when was the last time you drove you gun to work ?
333     I don't care what anyone says, A handgun is only good for killing
334 poeple. Rifles are a different matter, but no one is trying to get
335 rid of them for justifiable reasons. If one is able to buy an item
336 that is made expressly for killing other people, and do this with a
337 clear conscience, then that fact alone should preclude their abilty
338 to own a handgun.
339     So there; nyah,nyah.
340                                             Mr. Tim
341 Greetings again.  Bo, just how is it that you happen to know me???? Hmm?
342 Interesting.  At any rate, as for guns, little needs to be said that if
343 Guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns, no?  (Author unknown).
344 A little aside:  Methinks that Mr. Jackson (You DO know who he is, don't
345 you????) has shot himself in the foot with his many and varied comments
346 ranging from derogatory comments on Jewish people to preaching style.  
347 Will be an interesting thing to see how many votes he ends up getting.
348 Why is it that I turn on my tv and someone is asking for MORE MONEY?
349 Doesn't Uncle Sam have enough to go around, or are guns more important
350 than people?  Yet another telethon was on last night with pitiful attempts
351 to beg, borrow and steal money from the American public.  ENOUGH ALREADY!
352 When will we see the end of this?????? Until later, then.  Fgrep Whiskey
353 ###############################################################
354 Mr. Tim, Suggest you study both the Constitution AND history a little 
355 more. Also, you shouldn't pick out only those parts that you like. It 
356 must be taken as a whole, and considered in the intent in which it was 
357 originaly written, not a definition to fit your own desires. First the 
358 term Militia; Shall we look up the definition? 'An army composed of 
359 CITIZENS called out in time of emergency.'  Agreed that the 
360 Constitution does not say which types of arms are allowed, but if you 
361 were to study it further, you would find that it says that if 
362 something is not indicated within the constitution, that does not mean 
363 that it is not allowed, but rather the opposite. I noticed that though 
364 you capitalized the word MILITIA, you convienently ignored the rest of 
365 the statment "the right of the 'people' to keep and bear arms shall 
366 not be infringed."  Note that it speeks of the people, not of just a 
367 conscript army.  Also, though the handgun is used to kill people, so 
368 is a rife.  When was the last time you heard of someone using an M16 
369 to shoot a dear? On the other hand, it is a very uncommon thing for 
370 someone to kill somebody with a blackpowder pistol.
371 Also, the point being made with the car earlier, was that it is the person
372 behind the wheel that kills, and not the car, just as it is the person 
373 behind the gun that kills, and not the gun.

511 AW SHUCKS IT HAPPENED AGAIN
512 spaces between lines waste disk space.-- Your Mother
513 <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
514   ALL: please forgive me (for the gun control) (i didn't know it was loaded)
515   Piper: if L-4 & L-5 are gravity "wells", then why arn't they full of space
516 junk? in fact, why don't they have an atmosphere? over the eons, one would
517 expect to have to satellites (natural) in those positions...
518    One might also observe that since those points are availiable in limited
519 quantities (2) (except Morrison), why would a planet wish to clutter them up
520 with fixed objects? These points would obviously make excellent "holding"
521 areas for spacecraft, yes?
522    We can even get creative: Some advanced planet, eons ago, spotted our
523 humble planet, and realizing that earth would, some day, support an advanced
524 culture (such as our own?), zoom off through the void of space to meet space
525 ship earth as sort of a cosmic welcome wagon. Before departing, a quick 
526 neutrino scan of our neighborhood revealed 2 PERFECT places to park their
527 space cruiser.....so perfect they set the co-ordinates into the guidance
528 system before they leave Grekotznik (name of advanced planet). Imagine
529 their dismay at finding an expanded version of sputnik in their parking
530 space (pun). They have to park the space cruiser SOMEWHERE......the
531 trip has been VERY long (next rest area: 1.2 light-years).....the
532 photon cannons ARE charged up......hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. I wouldn't want
533 to be in L-4&5 THEN, now would you?

568   Aaron and Deborah -- Celestial mechanics is a little bit over my head,
569 so most of the stuff I'm quoting you is from popularizations-- but here goes
570 nothing.  The case of the earth-moon-third object is the well-known
571 (in circles that compute orbits of bodies) three-body problem.  For th
572 rest of us -- simple solutions for more than two bodies orbiting one anoher
573 in free space do not exist.  Add a third body and a simple set of equations
574 accurately describe the orbital motion of three or more bodies, exept in
575 one particular case -- where the third body is small in comparison to te
576 other two and occupys the L-4 and L-5 positions.  An L-4 and L-5 position
577 should occur for each pair of bodies in our solar system -- for the 
578 sun-earth combination, for the sun-venus, for the sun-mars, for the 
579 sun-jupiter and so forth.  In fact a group of asteroids known as the 
580 Trojans occupy the L-4 and L-5 points in the sun-jupiter system.  The forces
581 at these points are INCREDIBLY SMALL.  The gravity wells at these points
582 are more of the magnetude of cm/week2.  However, the earth-moon points do 
583 contain small amounts of debris.  One of the main proponents of the L-5
584 society is a man called ??? O'Niel (first name got lost) thus in some of 
585 our present science fiction the presence of O'Niel space habitations, his
586 contribution to the movement.  Aaron -- yes, I agree that these points are
587 the logcal staging areas for inter and intra-stellar traffic.  When th
588 Whimseys from planet Whim drop by for a visit, they most likely will wait
589 there for an invitation to descend.  In fact ... ever think about how big
590 that area of the sky is?  And just how small and insignificant a sperical
591 craft a mile in diameter would be at that distance?  Now if I wanted to 
592 keep an eye on a bunch of primitives, I'd use an asteroid, hollow it out,
593 paint it black, and set it at either the L-4 or L-5 points.  When they 
594 became civilized enough to come out and talk, then we'd think about contact.
