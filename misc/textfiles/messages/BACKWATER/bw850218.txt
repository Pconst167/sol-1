21      I walked to the Inn this time, my horses DIDN'T like that tree. When I arrived I realized I had probably insulted someone
22 and should find him and appoligize.
23  Once I had found the apprentice, I asked his forgiveness if I had insulted him.
24  "I'm very sorry if it was rude of me to leave when I did, I thought the conversation had changed. I would enjoy continuing it
25 if at all possible. And than again, you may have meant someone else entirely."

35 Lady S.: no offense, but PLEASE quite using MA 128! Due to an obsure bug in
36 the BWMS ROM it messes up the FI & FA functions (frequently used by patrons
37 to find where they quit reading). MA 126 is fine though..
38 Due to the fact that BWMS is burned into a set of ROMS (READ ONLY MEMORY)
39 the ma command is here & can't be removed. Thus it will be used....

71 L'Homme -- I don't like the sound of that.  I might suggest a study of the
72 "victim", once one has his habits, one has the man. (Also, one has an
73 insight into his motivations -- remember you are attempting to influence this
74 individual in your favor!)
75   Kathyd-- Watch out!! Don't spill your glass of milk!!!!
76   tilean -- I tried to catch you out for a purpose (feel free to do the same
77 with me, i end up doing the same thing).  As i say, i'm not a copter pilot,
78 but I did some mental excercises on the construction of controls for rotary
79 wing aircraft at one point.  The point, as Leonard made above, is to describe
80 the manuver rather than the control manipulations required to acheive the
81 manuver -- unless you are personally an expert in controlling the machine
82 described.  I, for example might describe the control manipulation of one
83 type of bulldozer, and be completely off base describing another.  Another
84 machine that could really foul someone of today up is the operation of a
85 Model T Ford.  A car is a car?  Did you ever drive one that had three
86 pedals on the floor and the throttle and a spark advance lever mounted
87 on the steering column where you'll find the gearshiv
88 ft and turn signals today?  A contemporary writer could be forgiven for not
89 knowing of the ideosincrasys(sp?) of machinery from another era, but
90 caution dictates that we avoid describing the controls of machines that
91 we have not personally operated (if someone else could pick nits in out
92 descriptions).  Your writing is too good to suffer from flaws that can be
93 easily corrected.  If I didn't care, it would be very easy to ignore the 
94 problems that irritate me....

100         #Air and gas are mixed in tightly controlled ratios in the carburetor.
101 This mixture passes through various chambers in the intake manifold that lead
102 directly to each intake valve. The downstroke of the piston caused by the
103 turning crankshaft also rotates the camshaft, which pushes on lifters that
104 are connected to push rods that open the intake valve, and close the exhaust
105 valve. The air/gas mixture is sucked into the chamber, and at the bottom of
106 the pisns downstroke, the cam has turned sufficiently to allow the intake
107 valve to close, sealing off the chamber. Now the piston begins its upward,
108 or compression cycle, all controlled by the crankshaft. The piston will
109 compress the air/gas mixture at the top of the chamber to as much as 1/12th
110 its original size in conventional internal combustion engines. At the extreme
111 end of the piston's compression cycle, the electrical system is busy supplying
112 charge to the sparkplug located in the side of the cylinder. The distributor,
113 which is being turned by the camshaft, guides a high voltage charge that
114 has hopefully been produced in a fully saturated coil, to each of the
115 cylinders. The timing must be very exact. When the points on the coil open,
116 the voltage is released to the particular plug the rotor is connected with,
117 and a spark jumps across the gap found between and anode and the base of
118 the spark plug. This spark ignites the highly compressed gas/air mixture,
119 causing an explosion, and an extremely fast release of gas. This exhaust
120 formed by the explosion forces the piston down, with turns the crankshaft,
121 which turns the timing chain, which turns the cam shaft, which moves the
122 lifter, which pushes the push rod, which opens the exhaust valve, which lets
123 the exhaust pass out of the cylinder into the exhaust manifold, where it
124 is ejected out of the system through the mufflers and pipes. The whole 
125 cycle begins again, and again, and again. In a typical engine like the BMW,
126 each piston goes though this four-part cycle an average of 400 times a
127 minute.#
128         I paused for a moment from my mental reconstruction of the NET
129 lecture on internal combustion engines to accelerate by a slow moving
130 domestic. The radio message from L'homme had said the house was in this
131 area, but I was having trouble finding it. 'Approach from the west side',
132 he had said. #Terrific Parity. You know I don't know my way around this
133 town. I haven't had a chance to get intense area familiarization training
134 yet. You expect me to pick my way through one-way streets and illogical
135 traffic planning without trouble? Sans Parity Hell. More life Sans Sense!#
136         Finally the street in question came into view. A left turn and I
137 was headed in the right direction. Things didn't look so bad after all. I
138 had found my way without TOO much trouble. A beat-up Fiat coupe on the 
139 opposite side of the street confirmed my location. #Well. This is it. Gaudy
140 you better be in there!#
141         I parked the car two blocks down, and walked to the house, using my
142 NET 'Don't look conspicuous' training. I think it worked; no shots were
143 fired; no alarms went off. As I walked by the driveway, I spied two 
144 painters working on the side of the house. It appeared as if they were doing
145 more looking than painting. Their backs were turned slightly, so I couldn't
146 get a good look at their faces. #Either two painters getting their jollies,
147 or two NET agents about to bust up a party. I bet I can help regardless of
148 the direction this little scene takes.# I withdrew my weapon, and approached
149 the ladder from behind. Something must have surprised them, because they
150 both suddenly jumped back a bit. Not enough to fall, but enough for me to get
151 sight of their faces. #L'homme and Farley.# Just then, the most interesting
152 thing happened in the vicinity of the window. "More surprises!", I said
153 under my breath.

308 While I was out, my head had been pumped up and filled with green and  
309 orange and purple fluid. When I moved too fast, my raw brain clonked 
310 against the side of my skull causing the painful garish blossoms to 
311 bloom in back of my eyes.  My face was mashed into a perpetual snarl
312 against my coat which had been rolled up as a pillow on a camp cot. I
313 felt like used gum.
314 My captor informed me pertly that we awaited my fellow NET agents who
315 were in lukewarm pursuit. Jerks. For Joshua, they did the full court
316 press of stakeouts. For me, probably a few desultory calls to hospitals
317 and morgues. They probably didn't know I had the silicon chip. They'd
318 do anything for new techno-spy gizmos, but would they care about me,
319 drugged by an ace wacko and lying here in pain and apprehension? Nah.
320 Just as well. It would give me time to question my jailer.  Why had
321 NET terminated his employment without terminating his life? He was vul-
322 nerable now, frightened by his own delusions. As he paced nervously, he
323 divulged this tale.
324 NET had assigned him to a remote village in the Rhodoppe Mts. of Bulgaria where he was to assist the formation of a 
325 resistance group by disrupting communist activites and seeing that the leaders
326 were killed.  There had already been ugly battles between local factions and he assumed the identity of the son of a   
327 family killed by the resistance. Since the son, Kosta, had been sent away to    school as a child, the villagers didn't 
328 question the identity of the NET agent who spoke their dialect and knew the     workings of the village. The old women  
329 regaled him with stories of his childish antics and the men discussed crops and politics with him. The real Kosta was a 
330 terrorist and had died in a bombing mission.
331 He worked as a farm mechanic and grew to love the sunny rugged landscape and thehealthy life. In truth, this area had 
332 never been loyal to the central government. The "communists" were a group of    farmers and laborers whose anti-Turk 
333 pro-Macedonian loyalties were over a thousand years old and were far stronger   than any alliegances formed in this 
334 century. They met weekly to squabble over use of the tractor shared by all the  villagers.  He was astonished that blood
335 had been shed over such a minor thing until he realized how hard this life was  and how denial of tractor use at a 
336 crucial time could cost lives.  It was easy to disrupt the communist group all- owing the resistance movement to gain 
337 control of the village, but Kosta could see little improvement either ideologi-
338 cally or economically.  Thick patient women still plodded to the fields before  dawn; the men still worked and worried  
339 and squabbled and the farmfolk still plied him with mutton stew, red wine and   laughter when he visited.
340 That fall, the NET signal to return did not appear. He stayed in the village,   reading his "father's" Russian novels 
341 and Orthodox texts, struggling with the Cyrillic script and wondering why a Marxist had such a library. He postponed 
342 killing the communist leaders. By spring, he had passed into an area forbidden  to agents. He had forgotten which of his
343 identities was real and which was assumed. He could see no superiority of one   side over the other and had little 
344 appetite for doing away with these men when he, as a NET agent, had killed far  more than they for far less provocation.
345 He threw himself into equipment repair and farm improvements, becoming more and more agitated within. 
346 In the early summer, he found the diary of the real Kosta. The last entry was   full of anguish.  "In what way are our 
347 victims of a different flesh than ourselves? How do we triumph when we defeat   our own souls?" At this he had gone 
348 irrevocably underground.
349 
350 The story unnerved me. Every agent faces this dilemma. The best the NET 
351 could say on the subject was, "You fight for your side becaouse it's    
352 YOUR SIDE; if you don't you willl lose and die." Not enough.
353 This guy was suffering from excessive sanity.
354 He relaxed and let some light in. The noise outside led me to believe

364 The words I have given thee have been painted more brightly from a pallet of
365 differing hues. These contrasts have filled in the partitians ever so greatly.
366 Your words are many, and tell of an even greater plight than I had fortold.
367 The dream of the past has been given form, the vision has been gien dimension.
368 It could only have been thee that has painted this masterpiece.
369 Thank you, for I have been long in search of a name, and a grip on myself.

386 to the above: last time I checked it was an explosion, controlled- but

427 First off let me say that this must be a dream as I could not have possibly attained access
428 to BW this early so as it is a dream I will comment on what I have read so far. I would not normally do so when I am awake
429 and get access at my normal 2 AM. Number 1, all this ruckus about engines, if the engine did not explode the highly flammable 
430 material called petroleum than what causes the heat, noise and energy? True, the explosions are minute as a gallon of gasoline
431 has the destructive power of somewhere in the neighborhood of 6 sticks of dynamite, so the finely sprayed air mixture is only 
432 large enough to ignite enough force to push the piston downward. What did you think the heat was caused from? Friction?
433 Another thing, kathyd, my idol, does not eat oreos, possibly turtles, cream puffs or dutch chocolates, but not oreos. This is 
434 a person of extreme class and would not know the word OREO let alone let one pass
435 through her lips. I like the stories so far, (I'm not as critical as some)or is it
436 that I am borderline mongoloid and can not 
437 determine realism?
438 Oh well, carry on you talented authors, I enjoy your script without critism.
439 Oh yes, when and if kathyd acquires access to BW, THOR says hello.
440 thorthorthorthorthorthorthorthorthor
441 thorthorthorthorthorthorthorthorthor
442 Is BWMS going back to philosophical
443 OOPs, ma 40, better change to say 76... arguements? That explosion in 
444 our car engine, if it is there may be taht 6 sticks, but hope it isn't
445 gasoline, an explosion is a lot different from the smooth but fast burning
446 desired in a car. But lifters? AARGGH, how quaint. Bute it is enough for
447 mere net agents.

450 If you watch closely, and quickly enough you may see the eye of the needle,
451 we don;t go there just for thrills, but we don't have enough fuel to make
452 rondezvoux with the ambulance and go any other way. Now don't bother me 
453 while I get our course down very, very exectly.
454 The ore ship creaked sleghtly, but so quickly did the engines cycle their
455 roar couldn't be heard. Slowly at first, but faster and faster the mountain
456 rushed up towards us.

459 L'homme: WHAT! And give you a swelled head?
460 engine: check the speed with which said "smooth but fast burning" 
461 propagates. Also note that the mixture ratios invlolved are in the
462 "explosive range" for a gasoline/air mixture. Also, unless you are
463 using a Delaval(sp) nozzle, burning does not generate a thrust. A 
464 confined explosion does... If it is "just burning", please explain
465 how it can generate enough force to move the piston to the bottom of
466 the stroke in the time required (lessee now, 8 cylinders at, say 2000 r
467 rpm [assuming that a cylinder is only fired once per revolution, I don't
468 really know for sure] gives <.03 sec for the ENTIRE cycle in each cyl.)

482 es of milk and 3lbs of Oreo's. Jack and Marci sat watching the T.V, with
483 the sound turned down. Tony was playing with a new electronic toy. Tina
484 was snoozing on top of her bed, phone cord near her hand. As Tony looked
485 away, Marci stole a kiss from a surprized Jack. Jack was still a nevous
486 wreck from the day in the pits. a strange twist had caused them to come
487 away with much more stock than they tought possible. Marci put her hand
488 on the back of Jack's neck and started to rub it gently. "ahhhh, say
489 Marci could you hand me a cookie?" Jack has his eyes closed and started
490 to relax. "open wide" marci shoved a cookie into his mouth with a 
491 crumbling effort. Tony had finished hooking up the new toy and said good-
492 night. Tina was still dead to the world.

502 L'Homme -- the situation is familiar.  You must apply the skills of the
503 hunter to the situation.  Since you will most likely not be able to obtain
504 access to this person through "office hours" -- typically these are the
505 favored times to do ANYTHING else -- your first step is to map out the
506 man's habits.  We are creatures of habit and routine.  Consider the problem
507 as though you were attempting to collect a bill of several thousand dollars.
508 Or as simply an intellectual challenge.  Habits are primarily structured 
509 around work.  Acedemics tend towards patters of the sort "M W &F he does
510 thing a at x y z times, T Th he does things at s and r, but every day he
511 does things at l and m," due to the school class structure.  Find out where
512 and when he is normally expected.  Your chances of catching him are greatest
513 when he has a short period between classes (probably when he has posted
514 office hours for), but not one long enough to tempt him out somewhere
515 else.  Another strategy is to ambush him at the end of one of his classes.
516 The best approach there seems to be a request for an appointment to meet,
517 unless it's just before office hours.  If it's the start of office hours,
518 the offer of a cup of coffee helps pull him away from the office and to an
519 area where you can control the situation and keep him away from the others
520 who doubtless are vainly attempting to accomplish something of the same
521 task.  (It's sheer hell to have prepared an eloquent plea and be interrupted
522 in the middle by a bunch of other people with similar requests on their
523 minds too!)  Normally a student meets a teacher in a class -- and gets to
524 know their habits unconciously.  You are working from a disadvantaged
525 position.  You need to establish that same rapport outside the classroom
526 situation.  It can be done, but not easily when you're not used to it,
527 and if you get good at it, it's one of the most useful skills you can
528 develop for life in the cold, cruel world.
529   One final note:  often a department secretary can save you many hours of
530 poring over catalogs and schedules.  The problem is to become an idetifieable
531 and valued "person" rather than one of the faceless masses that swirl through
532 the department.  The tactics are up to you  -- but most department secretaries
533 are ladies and appreciate politness and courtesy.  Their loyalty is to
534 their bosses, and to them students are quite often unwelcome interruptions
535 to their bosses' routine.  If you are percieved as a person rather than a
536 problem, access has a magic way of opening up.

544 point out the the name of the device you are talking about the does
545 the work is an 'Internal combustion engine' not an internal explosion

560      The person that needed to get in touch with you on the Bit Bucket is
561 not creative enough to have a desire to call The Inn, and too lazy 
562 (unmotivated?) to try to get through the busy signals. For what it's worth,
563 his name is David Willardson, and you'd probably want to try getting a hold of
564 him on The Northwest connection for fastest response. Oh, in case your wondering,
565 the topic of the communication is about some programs he thinks you may be
566 interested in. Personally, I think he is just butting in, but that's my
567 opinion....
