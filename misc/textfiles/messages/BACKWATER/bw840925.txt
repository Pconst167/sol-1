21 WOW !!!  At the top.  (That dispensed with, I may continue)
22 
23 ALL - The N.A.P.P. is scheduled for 5-OCT-1984 at around 1900.  
24       The place is the MT Bottle and Deli, which allows minors, but
25       not twits, so all BW Irr. will be allowed.
26       Last time, we begged, everyone said please, and Mikey came.
27       (Along with Batguano, DOM, CYM, and many others.)
28  
29       OK, Mikey - P L E A S E ! ! !
30 
31 Mikey - If we could get you a 1200 baud for a price within your budget,
32         ie. nothing, could BWMS handle it ?  Reading at 1200 baud
33         would be much easier on the eyes, and ease entry to the system as 
34         it would be less tied up.
35 
36 ALL - Did someone record the Nightline Broadcast last night ?  (On Beta, or
37       audio cassette)  I would love to see or hear it.

53    Mikey -- You have my deepest sympathies!  (Yes I understand the manual
54 problem -- I write them for a living!)  Part of the problem, of course,
55 is dealing with the general public.  Somehow it seems that the great
56 unwashed majority not only has an exaggerated opinion of their technical
57 expertise and reluctance to read the manuals that we write, but lack
58 the social skills necessary to relate to each other (and us) in a 
59 non-agressive way.  One of the most welcome features of the inn is the
60 social contracts that we see being formed around us.  Modes of behaviour
61 are tried, accepted or rejected, and a general feeling is reached as to
62 what is "good" behaviour and "bad".  We cooperate to conserve scanty
63 resources (disk space) and come down on those who waste lines.  We exhibit
64 a nice diversity of opinion, and defend each other's right to state 
65 differing opinions while attacking the opinions themselves.  Would that the 
66 world at large adopted the behaviour that the majority of Backwater users
67 exhibit from day to day.
68 
69 All ---  if you have not tried the old Nerdolux (now KAMAS BBS -- is that
70 official MiG?) it's kinda' interesting.  There is a topic called FICTION
71 that is just begging for something to be done.  It may take a few tries
72 to learn how to use it, but we really should give it a try!

129      THE McDONALD CODE
130 
131   This is another example of a serial I/O code. The name comes from Jerome
132 McDonald, the long-term senior member ofa dairy science research team with the
133 Department of Agriculture, who first popularized its use.
134   The code turned out to be so good and so effective that it was first picked
135 up by other government agencies and, then, by industry. It is now up before
136 several standards committees and, at present, it has been granted Electronic
137 Industries Evaluationary (EIE) status.
138   Thus, the old McDonald farm code is now an EIE I/O.

148 Someone up there is terribly mistaken. I have never been to one of
149 the NAPP meetings, and sorry to say will never in the future. I don't drink

154 It is not a matter of persuation, it is simply that I currently am not
155 into social activities. I need to do the things that I want to do, and
156 I have precious little time of my own available to do it in. It is
157 simply a matter of priorities, and I am afraid that the NAPP is not
158 very high on the list. Were it not that BWMS has its own built in forced
159 schedule, I wouldn't even be here. I have more then once considered
160 dropping it from shear lack of time to support it. It can be a large
161 drain on me in both time and being. Were it not for the small return I
162 get from it as an escape tool, I doubt that I could justify its existance
163 at all.

172 Thanx to all who contribute to this wonderfully and explicit BBS as I am
173 enjoying myself to the utmost by the class of writers utilizing and adding
174 to the boards character and prestige. I must agree with one person who spoke of 
175 how disagreeable it is to see someone with little or no social acceptable 
176 qualities get into the BBS and try to spoil it for those who genuinely give 
177 their best to making this board a cheerful breath of fresh air.

181 However, I do know a person who has a son of that name, and if this is the 
182 person to whom you refer, I can appreciate your (ooohh -- I worked myself into
183 a corner here and can't think of a word to use -- impression? impressedness?)
184 At any rate, this person is a co-worker with initials K.R. 
185   Mikey -- I appreciate your time problems.  I once ran a business of my own
186 and had very little time of my own as a result.  Now I work for others and
187 have very little time of my own.  Ahh, well....

217   Ratchet watched the Fortress towers through the Light- Enhancing scopes of the tank he had killed to be in.
218   The bodies laid on the wet sand of the beach. They had not lived to see the dusk which was just now ending.
219   Ratchet still watched the Towers slightly sorry for those who he had killed that day. He waited silently for the exlosions
220 that meant Lord Dakken was dead, and he could leave.
221   Checking his chronometer he noted that he had .003 of a second till the explosions destroyed the Towers and he could try to
222 escape. No time to cringe.
223   Explosions rocked the island and spewed rubble for a quarte kilometer. Ratchet checked the scope, the garrisson behind the
224 the gates of the Fortress were scattering and there was dissarray of orders, counter orders, and more orders.
225   Ratchet turned the keys that made the patrol tank start and left the scene. The electric motors humming, and Ratchet singi-
226 ng a song that Dakken and he had learned when they attended the english school in New York together.
227   Both were the sons of high ranking Intellgence under the covers of diplomats. "That is what an embassy is for, son." he
228 remembered his fathers words when he discovered his fathers secret mission.
229   Ratchet drove the tank over rocks and finally into the sea. When he got about 35 meters deep and 350 meters out he spotted
230 the submerged Hydroplane that would take him home. He drove for it, and decided to visit his fathers grave when he got back.
231   As the doors closed and the water drained out he open the hatches and saw Stacy running towards him. And he saw Captain Lee
232 come in.
233   He also spotted Dakken uniforms and didn't wait to see Dakken submachine guns. He gt Stacy up on the tank just as the first
234 shots were fired, at Stacy.
235   Ratchet saw that it was a flesh wound and scuttled Stacy into the tank. He drew his automatic and pulled the trigger and
236 started spraying the Dakken uniforms with red splatters.
237   Jumping down into the tank he turned the proper keys and pushed te right buttons and the main gun blasted a hole in the bay
238 doors. The little motors fought against the stormwaters that had started soon after he entered. 
239   Thats when he saw that Stacy was lifeless, dead.

259   What you have called drivel, CDP was mine. I am not in the mood for attacks on anything that I do, I never am.
260   I willl however welcome polite help in raising the quality of my writing. I am asking for help actually.
261   Instead of screaming Mindless Drivel why not tell me what is the matter with it all. If i agree, and even if not I will try
262 to acheive more next time. Is that understood?
263 
264   Riskers; Can I play?
265   Controllers; Okay, if nothing else than can I use a null as a delay character? If not; what then?
266   Tome; In an old odd facts book I have, it says that the weight of the Earth(parts estimation) is about 6.6 sextillion. Is
267 this correct?
268   NAPPers; If Mikey went, Aaron would have gone. I got on too late to tell anyone this before Mikey's message about time.

324 Mikey,
325 Bit Bucket just went 1200 baud.  Will you be the last on your block?
326 CAN you go 1200?  As I recall, someone previously asked this question.  The
327 way Bit Bucket is handling it is this: modem is on loan, to be purchased by
328 user donations.  It looks like they're gonna make it, after only a day.
329 Maybe you could try the same thing.

335 Prometheus: I've seen worse! You might try to watch your spelling. 
336 Something about the way the story was progressing bothers me, but I
337 can't quite figure out what it was. It may have been the uneven background.
338 You told us that his father (and Dakken's) had been in Intelligence, but you
339 didn't tell us WHO Stacy was, WHY he blew up the fortress, or WHY he and Dakken
340 were fighting.
341 As for delays, go ahead and use null.

345 THE IMMATURE PEOPLE
346 PIPER AND MIKEY: TIME IS WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT. ALTHOUGH I SHOULD NOT BE THE 
347 ONE TO TALK, AS I WAS A HORRIBLE WASTER OF TIME. YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT IS
348 *REALLY* IMPORTANT TO YOU, AND SCEDULE TIME TO DO IT. FOR EXAMPLE, I USED TO
349 WATCH STAR TREK RERUNS I HAD SEEN 5+ TIMES. THIS WASTED AN HOUR, WHEN I COULD
350 HAVE BEEN WORKING, OR HAVING FUN ON BWMS, OR ANYTHING ELSE BETTER.
351 A BALANCE IS ESSENTIAL. WITHOUT PLAY, WORK BECOMES TOO DEPRESSING AND YOU
352 SUFFER FROM "BURN-OUT". WITHOUT WORK,
353 PLAY BECOMES BORING AND STAGNANT. I NOW HAVE A STRICT SCEDULE, AND AM MUCH
354 MORE HAPPY THAN BEFORE. THOUGH THIS MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE, I FEEL THAT
355 IN GENERAL, IT IS A GREAT FORMULA FOR PERSONAL SUCCESS AND HAPPINESS.

370   I am Tome and this is what i thought of Hawthorne's story;
371   1 ]  It did have promise if only more facts were given. It was intended to start a story, but didn't give much of a beginni-

377 Ratchet didn't worry enough, or regret killing enough for me to identify with him. Katango Jones
378 ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
379 Prometheus: Ratchet, as in the Windhover Tapes?  Didn't think so.
380 Technically, your story (episode) had several grammatical errors.
381 You didn't maintain the same tense - "Ratchet turned the keys.....motors humming....".
382 Past tense in one sentence, present tense in the next.
383 You also had some subject-verb agreement problems - "the garrisson (sic) were scattering.."
384 Garrison is singular (it's one group), and so it should have been "was scattering" instead of "were".
385 A lot of the sentences need some sort of punctuation, such as commas or semicolons.
386 You try to cram too much into a sentence, and it gets confusing and bulky.  You are
387 also mistreating independant and subordinate clauses. (the grammarians are into
388 the terminology; I just have a passing knowledge.)
389 The first half wasn't bad as far as the story went, but the second half got
390 somewhat choppy.
391 If I had it sitting here in front of me, I could give more detailed criticism. 
392 Since my printer isn't hooked up right now, though, I'm operating from memory.
393 Hope this helps.

396 Well! after a perfectly wretched night I log into BW and find that after someone
397 tries to start something the twits return. I refer of course to the reference to
398 "mindles violence" Look around you, this whole world is made up of mindless

406 I agree with the dislike of mindless violence, and, no, it isn't "man's nature">
407 If the sysop is too busy with his own business to attend to our socializing, we
408 are the losers, but don't criticize him for it. Jonathan? , you seemed to
409 believe we all need some play time, as well as work time. What is 'play'
410 ?? isn't it something we enjoy?? Soo, Mike, do you enjoy working??
411 Will try to be there.

414   Hawthorne --  I hope you are not feeling cut to ribbons with the helpful 
415 criticism you have gotten.  I still remember coming out of a conference with
416 an editor feeling lower than the dust on the belly of a burrowing snake.  Just
417 remember that 1. you asked for help and 2. the help has been of a positive
418 nature.  It took me nearly two days to realize emotionally that the lady who
419 edited my first book really was helping rather than attacking me personally.
420 Grit your teeth, bear the pain, swallow you pride, admit you can improve, then
421 rewrite with that criticism in mind.  I know, it hurts, but do it and the 
422 improvement makes you feel as good as the pain hurt.  After a number of years,
423 it becomes easier to divorce yourself from your writings, after all, they are
424 what you say, not who you are.  Taking criticism is never easy, but it never
425 should be.  Objections to your subject matter, however, are never valid.  You,
426 and you alone, can choose what you want to write about.  Those who object to 
427 your choice of subject are merely exposing their limited appreciation of the
428 variety available in the world.  The only person on this board who has the right
429 to dictate subject mater is Mikey -- and he chooses only to remove writings he
430 finds in bad taste.  (I devfend your right to write sado-masochistic pornography
431 if you wish to, and Mikey's right to remove it from the board.)  Some persons
432 are offended by violence, others by sex, others by religion, and others by the
433 lack of one or more of the above.  Have fun, offend them as you wish -- but
434 separate criticism of the writing from dislike of the subject you are writing
435 about.  Your writing shows promise -- what you need to do is practice, and 
436 you'll find some of the toughest (and also easiest) critics around on the
437 backwater.  Go to it! Produce! (By the way, if you want a multi-author story,
438 the rules change -- if you want to do it all yourself proceed.)

441 Piper: I would disagree with you on one point above, That being that
442 objections to subject matter are unimportant. I learned it hard hard
443 way, I lost a contract because I assumed that anything I wrote would
444 be accepted. It was for a while, but only because the editor didn't 
445 know anything about the subject, and had nothing to gauge my subject
446 matter on. Later as he learned more, he began to see that what I was
447 writting did not fit into what he was trying to sell. I was asked to
448 change my subject matter as a result, or.... I took some offenseat
449 this (it is hard not to when someone critisizes your work) but did
450 try to adjust. But finally we both decided that I wasn't fit for doing
451 what he wanted, so the contract was terminated. I was glad to get out
452 of it because it was no longer fun. You have every right to write what
453 you want, but your audience has every right to object as well, and
454 further they have the right to ask that you remove yourself from their
455 enviorment if it is deemed such. (I.E. If I were to start writting
456 porn for the Oregonian, the readers would have a right to request
457 that I stop.) This is because I am invading their enviornment (their
458 daily paper). On the other hand were I do write the column for 
459 Willamette Week.. err ah excuse me.. for some underground newspaper
460 that the audience accepted that type of writting, then the subject
461 matter is not of concern. You can write anything you want in the 
462 privacy of your own home, but when you decide to present it to the 
463 world, you have to expect that what you have written may not be
464 accepted by everyone. Nor is there anything wrong in that, it's life!
465 ***********************************************************:
466 On the subject matter of work/play, I disagree with that vastly 
467 missused concept. There are things in life you do because you 
468 want to, and there are things you are willing to do that you
469 don't like so that you can do those things you want. These are
470 not always divided into work or play, many times work is play.
471 If you veiw it from the standpoint of enjoyment of the activity.
472 And I have also seen many situations where supposed play was
473 not a very enjoyable activity, does this make it work?
474 We usually set goals of those things we want to do, and then
475 work towards those goals sometimes the activity is enjoyable
476 other times it isn't. But each side activity away from them
477 main goal must be weighed against the priorities of striving
478 towards the main goal. Sometimes they loose out, and sometimes
479 they don't. But is seldom a matter of play verses work in the
480 strictest sense. As time goes by, your values and priorities
481 change and things that had high priorities in the past will
482 dwindle, while other activities will increase in priorities.
483 No one else can decide your goals and priorities for you,
484 you must do that for yourself, or you will never enjoy life.

542    Mikey -- point well taken on subject matter.  However, we must always
543 distinguish between criticism of the subject and criticism of the craft
544 by which the subject is presented.  Our duty in criticizing others
545 (ahh .. we do that so well, don't we?) is to make those criticisms clear
546 to those whom we criticize.  It's a cheap shot to call someone's writing
547 poor if the content is what we object to -- or, in this world of imperfect
548 grammar, to denigrate an arguement because the person presenting h(is)(er)
549 views does not use accepted grammar or spelling.  True, poor spelling and
550 grammar can weaken an arguement, but do not invalidate a point of view.
551    Also, we who throw our thoughts out to the world must try to improve
552 the presentation of those views -- your audience reacts very strongly to
553 the cosmetics of the presentation.  Now to go out and see if my cow has
554 decided to produce a replica of herself (replicow?).

556 *****************************************************
557 Piper: Very true, it is one of the biggest problems I encountered
558 as a writer, getting constructive feedback so that I could find out
559 if my audience liked what I was writting. All too often I would get
560 no response at all or when I did it was simply in the form of it
561 was OK, or it stunk. These are hardly inputs which allow me to see
562 what I am doing wrong or right. Unforunately, I think a lot of the
563 non-informative feedback is simply due to the person not knowing 
564 how to express his like or dislike. Thus the typical response of
565 it was great, or it was garbage. Personally, I am not as intense
566 over things like grammer, puncuation and speeling, but I do recognize
567 the destruction they can cause to the flow of the story being told. 
568 The less enticing the story, the greater the chance of loosing the
569 reader due to the poor thought carrier (words). The other thing that
570 hurts the story a lot, is lack of personal involvment in the story
571 by the author. The story must contain substance. If you don't care
572 about it, how do you expect your readers to care? The emotions do
573 show thru. If we get into fictional writting, another common problem
574 by the emerging writter is to treat the enemy as props, things to
575 use for the sake of the story. This can be a dredful mistake. The
576 reader needs to understand the otherside of the issue too. They need
577 to know why it is the enemy, and this reasoning must hold up with the
578 story line. Alass, to often they are so intent on getting to the 
579 action, that they forget about how they got there. (Mind you, I am
580 as guilty as anyone in many of these things, but when I do write,
581 I try to keep them in mind. Story lines can be had a dime a dozen.
582 It is being able to build them into a real and tangible world that
583 the readers can identify with that is tough. That is what seperates
584 the writers from the copyboys.
