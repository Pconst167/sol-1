21 PAM: IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF THE PATRONS ARE A BIT MIFFED AT MISSING YOU 
22 DURING THE LAST ADVENTURE, AND NOW THE CURRENT ADVENTURE THAT ELGER HAS 
23 STARTED SEEMS TO HAVE PUT YOU IN A POSITION WHICH IS ISOLATED FROM THE INN. 
24 MAYBE YOU AND ELGER CAN DIRECT IT IN A DIRECTION WHICH WILL ALLOW 
25 INTERACTION WITH THOSE WHO FEEL LEFT OUT?
26 
27 OTHERS: PLEASE HAVE PATIENCE, PAM'S ACCESS IS LIMITED. SHE ACTUALY HAS TO 
28 BUDGET TIME TO EVEN GET ON BWMS, THUS HER SCARCE ACTIVITY HERE. I AM JUST 
29 HAPPY THAT SHE DEEMS TO CONTINUE TO APPEAR HERE AT ALL. IF IT WASN'T FOR THE 
30 FACT THAT I RUN THIS MAD HOUSE, I KNOW I WOULDN'T HAVE TIME TO BE HERE.
31 
32 KEN: YES, PAM MOST CERTAINLY DOES EXIST, AND AS I STATED BEFORE, SHE IS A 
33 FRIEND. IF YOU HAD BEEN AROUND IN EARLIER TIMES, YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN SOME OF 
34 HER MORE PROLIFIC WORKS. BUT NOW HER WORK HAS LIMITTED HER ABILITY TO SPEND 
35 20 HOURS A DAY DIALING PHONE NUMBERS. ALSO, I MIGHT ADD THAT PAM MOST 
36 CERTAINLY KNOWS THE SUBJECT ABOUT WHICH SHE WEAVES HER ADVENTURE. I ON THE 
37 OTHER HAND TEND TO BE A BIT SLOPPY IN THAT ASPECT, AND SIMPLY RELY ON BRUTE 
38 FORCE CREATIVITY THUS LEAVING THINGS A BIT COURSE WHEN I WRITE WHICH IS WHY 
39 I DON'T DO MUCH OF IT. FINALY, WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT? YOU 
40 DECRY PEOPLE COPYING FROM EXISTING SOURCES, (WHICH I WOULD AGREE WITH, THERE 
41 IS LIMITTED ENOUGH SPACE HERE WITHOUT HAVING TO SEE WORKS THAT HAVE BEEN 
42 DONE BEFORE) YET THEN YOU COPIED SEVERAL VERSES FROM A SONG. NEXT YOU DECRY 
43 PEOPLE LEAVING MEANINGLESS STORIES, THEN PRECEED TO LEAVE YOUR OWN. DO YOU 
44 ARGUE JUST TO HEAR YOUR OWN VOICE? 
45 AS FAR AS WHAT TYPE OF PERSON I AM, I QUOTE POPIE "I AM WHAT I AM, AND 
46 THAT'S ALL THAT I AM." I DON'T FIND ANY ENJOYMENT OUT OF POWER TRIPS AND 
47 VIOLENCE, BUT NEITHER DO I CONSIDER MY VIEWS AS THE ONLY VALID ONES. I HAVE 
48 A HANDS OFF ATTITUDE TO THIS SYSTEM AS IT EXPOSES ME TO IDEAS AND CONCEPTS 
49 THAT ARE NOT MY OWN IF I WERE TO LIMIT IT TO ONLY THOSE THINGS I LIKE, I 
50 WOULD ONLY BE BOASTING MY OWN EGO GENERATED OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD, AND 
51 PROBABLY END UP WITH A LOT FEWER CUSTOMERS. CREATIVITY IS NOT GAINED BY 
52 LIMITTING YOURSELF TO ONLY THOSE THINGS YOU LIKE.

56 ALL: A FEW NOTES ON SYSTEM ETIQUETTE
57 
58 THIS BBS IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, SO PLEASE WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE. I UNDERSTAND 
59 THAT SOME OF YOU DON'T CONSIDER FOUL LANGUAGE TO BE ALL THAT BAD, BUT THERE 
60 ARE THOSE WHO ARE OFFENDED BY IT (ME FOR ONE). I AM RATHER OPEN TO MOST 
61 OTHER THINGS AS CAN BE SEEN BY THE WIDE VARITY OF WRITINGS THAT SHOW UP 
62 HERE. SOME LIMITATIONS: I WILL REMOVE ANY AND ALL MESSAGES SOLICITING OR 
63 PROMOTING ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. I WILL REMOVE OR EDIT ANY MESSAGES CONTAINING 
64 FOUL OR ABUSIVE LANGAUGE. (SORRY FOLKS, BUT IT'S MY SYSTEM, SO I GET TO 
65 DECIDE WHAT I DON'T LIKE.)
66 
67 IT IS CONSIDERED POLITE TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF THIS IS TRUE HERE AS WELL 
68 WHILE THE INN DOES HIRE JANITORIAL SERVICES, THE MESSER IT IS, THE MORE IT 
69 COSTS. AND WITH PAM ONLY WORKING PART TIME AS BARMAID, I HAVE TO SPEND ALOT 
70 OF TIME CLEANING THINGS UP MYSELF. (I REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES I DO HIDE THE 
71 TOWELS BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE THEFT, AND DURING THESE TIMES IT IS ACCEPTABLE 
72 TO LEAVE AN OCCASIOAL MESS, BUT DO TRY TO BECAREFUL WHEN THIS IS THE CASE.
73 
74 IT IS CONSIDERED IMPOLITE TO DESTROY, DELETE, OR OTHERWISE VANDLIZE OTHERS 
75 MESSAGES. IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO CLEAN UP TRASH LEFT BY OTHERS (I.E. HELP, 
76 LIST, OFF, AND OTHER COMMANDS AND BLANK LINES LEFT IN ENTER MODE.) CERTAIN 
77 USERS ARE AWARE OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED PROPER HERE AND WHAT IS NOT, AND WILL 
78 DELETE THEM IF I DON'T (THIS IS JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE MORE 
79 POEPLE OUT THERE WATCHING THINGS THEN JUST ME.) THERE ARE CERTAIN FUNCTIONS 
80 THAT ONLY I AND A COUPLE OF OTHER PEOPLE CAN USE. WHEN A LINE DISAPPEARS BUT 
81 ITS NUMBER IS STILL IN USE (SUCH AS LIST SKIPING FROM 100 TO 110), IT MEANS 
82 THAT SOMEONE ELSE DELETED THE LINE. IF I DELETE THE LINE, IT WILL DISAPPEAR, 
83 AND THE LINES WILL BE RENUMBERED.
84 
85 PLEASE TRY TO HOLD YOUR ENTRIES DOWN TO 50 LINES OR LESS PER ENTRY. THIS IS 
86 NOT A REQUIREMENT, ONLY A REQUEST. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME ENTERIES 
87 THAT CAN EXCEED THIS (SUCH AS THIS ONE). IT IS ONLY THAT THERE ARE MANY 
88 USERS THAT LIKE TO LOOK IN ON THE INN AND CONTRIBUTE, BUT SINCE THERE ARE 
89 ONLY 600 OR SO LINES AVAILABLE FOR USE, IT CAN GO BY RATHER RAPIDLY IF LOTS 
90 OF SPACE IS USED, THUS LEAVING MANY IN THE DARK AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON IF 
91 THEY CAN'T CALL IN EVERYDAY.
92 
93 IN ADDITION TO THIS PLEASE DON'T WASTE WHAT SPACE YOU DO USE. EACH LINE (AS 
94 INDICATED BY A TRAILING CARRAIGE RETURN) IS COMPLETE IN ITSELF AND USES UP 
95 ONE OF THE AVAILABLE 600 LINES. SO PLEASE USE BLANK LINES SPARINGLY, EVEN 
96 THOUGH THERE IS NOTHING IN IT, IT STILL TAKES UP SPACE. THE NORMAL LINE 
97 LENGTH USED HERE IS 76 CHARACTERS. SOME USE 128 CHARACTERS (THE MAXIMUM) 
98 WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE, BUT TRY TO USE AT LEAST 50 OR 60 CHARACTERS PER LINE 
99 MINIMUM, AGAIN THE LINE IS USED UP NO MATTER HOW MANY CHARACTERS ARE IN IT.
100 
101 PLEASE TRY TO HOLD YOUR LINE TIME DOWN TO A MINIMUM, ESPECIALY AROUND 7:00AM 
102 TO 9:00AM ; 4:00PM TO 7:00PM ; 9:00PM TO 12:00PM THESE ARE PRIME TIME HOURS 
103 WHEN MOST USERS TRY TO GET ON. RECOMMENDED TIME ONE HOUR OR LESS (ESPECIALLY 
104 DURING PRIME TIME HOURS). FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO USE IT LONGER, PLEASE TRY TO 
105 DO SO DURING NON-PRIME HOURS. THIS IS ONLY A REQUEST, BUT PLEASE DO TRY TO 
106 SHOW A LITTLE COURTESY TO YOUR FELLOW USERS. 
107                           THANK YOU

114 To Cistop Mikey, I'm glad that you have answered some of my questions.
115 I didn't mean to sound so "hard nosed" but I don't understand why this is a writers practice board and not a full fledged
116 user info board.  But it is your system and run as you see fit! So you know pam personnally huh? That is pretty kool then.
117 Also, is this system a  program that you wrote or pre-written software?
118 well I'm here at the wafer ville and I'm short on time.  So I'm cutting it short so I can review Drive B.

144  
145      The youthful scrawl, plastered across the wall of the Inn as if in
146 challenge, is one of the first things to cause a smile to pass my lips in
147 quite some time.  The child asks if I know of Marduk, if I know the
148 Sumerian equivalent of demon, demands I respond, then expects me to respond
149 based upon his own schedule.  Yes, Uruku, I have read the Necronomicon, but
150 I attempt to have more originality than to plagarize The Book of Entrance,
151 or even to put a great deal of faith in a creation of Madison Avenue for
152 the the purposes of increasing the sales of the literary work of H.P.
153 Lovecraft and to prey on the desire of fandom to purchase anything related
154 to their favorite author.
155  
156      My heritage is Gaelic, not middle eastern, and so I am more familiar
157 with the legends of the De Danaan.  Which is just as well, as I have great
158 respect for some aspects of paganism, but very little for necromancy and
159 its sort.  As to the "Necronomicon", the Introduction is very informative
160 and accurate, the bibliography gives many excellent sources for study, but
161 the rest of the text is a twentieth century creation.
162  
163      Since you obviously want to lecture others, perhaps you could inform
164 us why you have made BWMS the target of your malevolent attack.  Is it
165 because of pure spite?  Are small, private systems an easier (and safer)
166 target for your vandalism than larger and better protected ones?  Or is it
167 simply (as it appears) that you are young and have yet to be properly
168 toilet trained?  I don't intend to be insulting, but you seem to be
169 intelligent, and it has always bothered me to see someone of intelligence
170 wasting their time playing the part of the fool.
171  
172      Mike Day is a professional programmer, and as such he doesn't suffer
173 fools easily.  On the other hand, I have spent most of my career attempting
174 to deal with the public, I usually try to see everyone I come in contact
175 with in as complimentary a light as possible.  Show me that there is more
176 to you than snide commentary and self centered ego puffing.  I'm sure there
177 is.

193 Being lost and a guest on your land PAM, I will follow your lead 
194 in the direction you decide to take. It does bother me though, 
195 the violent emotions I feel eminating from across the sea. Why 
196 is it that the standard reaction around here to a supposed 
197 threat is to want to bash somebodies head in? And if the one 
198 causing the problem is not available they make up their own 
199 paper tigers to fight? I am reminded of those nature films they 
200 like to show of rams bashing their brains out to prove who is 
201 better. Ah well, I guess in that aspect man is no better then 
202 the animals he proposes himself to be above.

214                               Softly
215      The sun had risen.  The killing ground was ready.  Redish hues
216 highlighted the troops assembled in the courtyard.  Arrayed in an orderly
217 row, uniforms crisp and clean, their weapons smelled of fresh oil.  The
218 prisoner stood bound at the stake.  A white linen shirt covered his breast.
219 The air was still, expectant.
220      The silence was broken by the Captain-of-the-Guard; "David Alexander,
221 you have been convicted of crimes against the State.  You have been
222 sentenced to death by firing squad.  Do you have any final words?"
223      The prisoner stirred as if from meditation.  "You may call my actions
224 crimes; many think of them as acts of freedom."  Then almost to himself;
225 "O death, be my gentle mistress."  He had finished.
226       The Captain approached Alexander; gently as to a lover he asked the
227 routine questions;
228      "Cigarette?"
229      "No."
230      "Blindfold?"
231      "No."
232      "Last request?"
233       The prisoner smiled to himself; "Nothing you would grant."  A single
234 tear flowed down his cheek.
235      Turning to his troops, the Captain swept them with his eyes.  Pleased
236 with what he saw, he moved to the side and began the ritual.
237      "Ready."  As one, cartridges were chambered with a final click.  The
238 prisoner drew himself up, standing straight and sure.
239      "Aim."
240      "Fire!"
241      A single crack filled the stillness.  The Prisoner slumped.  In the
242 distance a single bird began to sing.  A song of life.

247 The bard turned to see what all the commotion was about. What kind of
248 creature is tha{BLINK}t?
249 He was standing on a mud flat. "Hey! Where's the Boat?!" Turning he saw
250 another figure standing over a body of some sort of animal. A small 
251 sabertooth, perhaps?
252 Approaching, he recognized the apprentice. He was about to greet him when
253 the cat moved... 
254 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
255 Sorry about this folks, but we had *PLANNED* to move on the weekend of the
256 21st. Things took a LOT longer than expected (the computer got packed
257 on the 21st & I just got everything set up again this morning!)
258 Voyeur & MIG: My new number is my old #-5384518
259 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
260 The creature was alive, he could feel its... thoughts? emotions?... 
261 perhaps 'feelings' fit best. It had an image in its mind - a friend from
262 whom it had become seperated in a storm. Was that Tarn? Perhaps.
263 But first he must tend to this one - "Green Eyes" it called itself.

282 of the many realities! I hope you move went as well as could be expected. Now
283 that you have decided to rejoin the land of the living, maybe you can lend a
284 hand and still the violent waters that make up this once calm pool known as
285 BWMS? The ground is infested with BUGS! And not many of us are so well

298         your defence earlier it was out of principal, not nessesarily
299         because I knew you (I am a relative latecomer, only being a regular

365 The ship appeared with a shimmer, smashing into the network of force beams. 
366 Sparks flew around the controller on his high pearch as he desperately struggled
367 with the mental energies, directing and shaping them to fit the smooth outline 
368 of the trans-glactic force absorbers mounted on the hull of the liner.  The 
369 screaming of the ship dropped to a low whine, and the controller dropped from 
370 his chair.  His job was completed, and he hurried to get a glimpse of the disemk
371 ing president.  The crowd was just forming at the port as the airlock opened and

430 DEBORAH: please comment on this (and finnish your essay on the "cloud"!)...
431 (text is set in MA 128) (sorry..)
432 "What does the Biblical Passage saying that Christ will come on the clouds signify?"
433    If the Second Advent of the Lord is to be realized by a birth on the earth, we must know the significance of the Biblical
434 passage saying that he will come on the clouds.  To know this, we must first understand the meaning of the word "clouds".  We 
435 read in Revelation 1:7: 'Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, every one who pierced him; and all 
436 the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so, Amen.'  From this we know that all men will surely see Christ 
437 comming again. Meanwhile, at the time when Stephen was martyred, only the saints whose spiritual were open could see Jesus 
438 sitting at the right hand of God (Acts 7:55). Consequently, if Jesus, who is in the spirit world, should come in a spiritual 
439 body, he will be seen only by those whose spiritual eyes are open; so it would never be that every eye will see Christ coming 
440 again. Therefore, we can understand that it is because he will come in the flesh that the Bible says every eye will see the Lor
441 at his coming. The Lord, in the flesh, cannot come on the clouds, so the "clouds" are surely symbolic.
442     The same Biblical passage goes on to say that every one who pierced him will also see him.  Those who pierced Jesus were th
443 Roman soldiers of his days.  However, those Roman soldiers, of course, cannot see the Lord coming again. It is because, if the
444 Roman soldiers are able to see the Lord comming again on the earth, they must be resurrected, but it says in Revelation 20:5 
445 that those who will be resurected at the time of the Lord's Second Advent are only those who will participate in the first res-
446 urrection, and the rest of the dead would not come to life until the thousand years (the millennium) are ended. Therefore, we 
447 must interpret "those who pierced" as a parable, regarding it to be the appelation for those who, having believed Christ will 
448 come on the clouds, will disregard and persecute him when he comes again most unexpectadly through a physical birth on the 
449 earth. If "those who pierced" should be interpreted as a parable in this way, there would be no reason why we cannot interpret 
450 the word "clouds" in the same passage, also, as a parable.

498 After realizing that the cat was relatively harmless, the bard left
499 Eric to the task of healing it. He began to check his equipment...
500 "Damn! It isn't working... well how about the... " After a space the bard
501 merely sat and stared at the devices piled around him. There didn't seem to be
502 anything WRONG with them... except the fact that their readings were all utter 
503 NONSENSE. The tracker insisted that he was still on the Columbia, same world 
504 line, velocity, etc. That meant that however he had gotten here (wherever "here"
505 is!) it hadn't registered on ANYTHING. Any attempt to use his gear for a shift
506 would be a totally blind jump.
507 Maybe the apprentice could get them out of this...

509 In honor of the battles of the last disk:
510 One Tin Soldier (theme from "Billy Jack")
511 Listen, children, to a story that was written long ago
512 'bout a kingdom on a mountain and the valley folk below
513 On the mountain was a treasure, buried deep beneath a stone
514 And the valley people swore they'd have it for their very own.
515 Chorus:Go ahead and hate your nieghbor, go ahead and cheat a friend
516 Do it in the name of Heaven, you can justify it in the end
517 There won't be any trumpets blowin' come the judgement day
518 On the bloody morning after one tin soldier rides away...
519 So the people of the valley sent a message up the hill
520 Asking for the buried treasure, tons of gold for which they'd kill
521 Came an answer from the kingdom: "With our brothers, we will share
522 All the secrets of our mountain, all the riches buried there."
523 CHORUS
524 Now the valley cried with anger, "Mount your horses, draw your sword!"
525 And they killed the mountain people, so they won their just reward
526 Now they stood beside the treasure, on the mountain dark and red
527 Turned the stone and looked beneath it "PEACE ON EARTH" was all it said...
528 CHORUS
529 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
530 Whisper: the move was to get more room. 
531 .............................
532 While he could not seem to touch the cat's thoughts, he could feel its
533 gratitude. #Thou art welcome, my friend,# he thought at it.
534 It almost knocked him off his feet when it tried to rub up against him 
535 as he walked over to Kenin and his pile of 'equipment'. It immediately "apologized"
536 though.
537 They discussed the situation as Kenin repacked his gear. The cat seemed 
538 to wish to westwards. Having no better plan, they followed.
539 They reached the bank of a stream. In spite of the recent flooding, the outline
540 of a pentagram was still visible. The apprentice bent down to examine one of the
541 line{BLINK}s. 
542 They were standing on an expanse of gray ash at the foot of a mountain.
543 "Not again!"

591 All: The other day when I was on BW, someone picked up a new cordless phone

594 crashed and I thought Backwater did, too. (Evidently it didn't) Does any
595 one know what happened? I was entering a message and someone most have
