20 EVAN: IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR MODEM DOESN'T LIKE THE CHARACTERS THAT BW ECHOS
21 BACK. THE WAY AROUNG THIS IS TO WAIT FOR THE RETURN CHARACTER BEFORE
22 SENDING THE NEXT ONE. WHAT CAN HAPPEN, IS THAT WHEN YOU SEND A CHARACTER,
23 IT CAN BE DISRUPTTED BY THE RETURN CHARACTER. 103 MODEMS NEVER WERE
24 DESIGNED FOR FULL SPEED TRANSFERS, THEY WERE EXPECTED TO BE RUN BY 
25 PEOPLE WHICH GIVES ENOUGH TIME FOR THE CHARACTER TO GET BACK BEFORE THE
26 NEXT ONE IS SENT. THERE IS A SECOND HARMONIC FROM THE ORIGINATE SIGNAL
27 THAT IS SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANSWER MODEMS RECEIVER. SO, WHAT
28 HAPPENS IS THAT IF EVERYTHING IS NOT PERFECTLY PROPER IN THE CONECTION,
29 (HAVE YOU EVER HAD A PERFECT PONE LINE?) THEN NASTY THINGS HAPPEN.

31 CALLING PAM.... HELLO PAM.......
32 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
33 WERE OFF TO SEE THE WIZARD, THE WONDERFUL.....
34 OR ARE WE? I BELIEVE WE HAVE TOO MANY REALITY PILLS FLOATING AROUND THIS
35 PLACE. CAN'T WE GET SOME SEMBLANCE OF NORMALITY HERE?
36 MONSIEUR D'AUTUN: YOU SEEM TO HAVE MANY CONNECTIONS AND FRIENDS. CAN YOU 
37 RECOMMEND ANYONE I CAN HIRE TO FIND PAM. MR. WASSIR'S DUNGEON IS TYPICAL,
38 COMPLETE WITH SECRET DOORS. I BELIEVE I HAVE IT FAIRLY WELL MAPPED OUT, BUT
39 I CAN FIND NO SIGN OF PAM. ALL HIS TOYS (IE. IRON MAIDEN, RACK, ETC.) SEEM
40 TO BE IN A STATE OF DISREPAIR DUE TO DISUSE. IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PAM
41 WAS EVER THERE, AT LEAST AS A PRISONER. I WOULD APPRECIATE ALL THE HELP I 
42 COULD GET TO FIND HER.
43 ALL: WHERE IS THE WIZARD. AND WHY IS ANYBODY GOING TO FIND HIM?
44 (OTHER THAN THE COMMANDER). IF THE NINJA STILL WANTS COMPANY, I WOULD
45 BE GLAD TO HELP HIM, AND TALK ABOUT A VERY PECIULAR VW?!?!?

49      The air had that gently washed smell that only a spring shower can
50 bring.  The red images of a 'Budweiser' sign sparkled on the rain-slicked
51 streets.  As I entered the neighborhood tavern, fleeting impressions of
52 blue-collars, red necks, and hairy, worked-hardened muscles tickled my
53 senses.  The sign over the door read:  "The Dew Droppe Inn".  A better name
54 would have been Hard Hat Heaven.  If Wassir had a weakness, it was for 
55 joints like this one.
56      The scent of cheap cigars and stale beer filled my lungs.  Assorted
57 thugs and low lifes played pool at a table in the rear.  No one seemed to
58 notice as I took a seat at the bar and ordered a beer.  The bartender was a
59 talkative fellow.  Lucky for me I have a talent for languages; Early Grunt
60 is one of my specialties.
61      After my fifth (or was it sixth?) beer, I sensed that someone had slid
62 onto the stool next to me.  I glanced over and did a double take.  No! It
63 couldn't be.  Could it?  The resemblence was amazing.  Those beady eyes.
64 Those freckles, those floppy ears, that idiotic grin.  All he needed was a
65 sign hanging around his neck that read:
66                   What me worry?
67      I couldn't contain myself.  It just blurted out; "Say buddy, did you
68 know you look just like Alfred E. Neuman?"
69      The idiotic grin changed to a snarl.  "Stuff it, Salazar!"
70      "Mohammed, great disguise."
71      "Yeah, well it was the only one the Acme Disguise Shop had left.  I
72 don't want to hear any cracks about it."
73      "O.K. Tell me what this is all about."
74      "I think we can help each other.  Old man Hutton was captured by your
75 favorite bad guy, McKane.  Don't worry though, he escaped.  I think he and
76 Petrov eloped.  So much for your case."
77      "What about the Egg?"
78      "Hold your horses.  I was just coming to that.  It's been taken by
79 the Wizard to the Land of Oz.  I was thinking we could snatch it and split
80 the loot."
81      I groaned to myself.  Land of Oz?  Maybe I should have stayed on 
82 Daddy's hemp farm in Turkey.  But anything for a buck.  "All right, I'm in.
83 How do we get to this Land of Oz?"
84      "Through that paisley door over there."  He motioned to the back of the
85 tavern.  But that door hadn't been there before.  I've got to cut down on 
86 this cheap Mexican beer.  Before I could utter a word, Wassir grabbed me by
87 that arm and propelled me to and through the door.
88      The universe whirled... Colours turned inside out... I felt as though
89 I was floating through a deep pool of lime jello.  When my head cleared, we
90 were standing in a dark, forboding forest.  The trees hung low over the
91 roadway.  Their gnarled limbs stretched out as if they were trying to grasp
92 us.  They reminded me of evil beings searching for ripe souls.  Tufts of
93 grass pushed through the crumbling, yellow bricks.
94       A cold shiver ran up my spine.  I felt the friendly heft of my .44
95 under my arm.  I glanced over at Wassir.  His grim reassured me.  What me
96 worry?  At the same moment we started to laugh uncontrollably.  With tears
97 running down our faces,  we linked arm in arm and skipped bravely down the
98 yellow brick road.  Singing...
99           Lions and Tigers and BEARS...  *OH MY*

186 Wassir has PAM. Salazar has the hots for her and is following 
187 Wassir. Wassir is following the yellow brick road. Dorthy 
188 doesn't seem to be following anyone but the dog. Ignor her.
189 
190 In briefing your detective advise caution. Salazar is armed 
191 and Alfred E Newman isn't who he seems.
192 
193 Detectives are expensive but you can save money by hiring 
194 amateurs. Fast Freddie is unemployed, the Outsider is looking 
195 for adventure, and Jolly Jim is a thug for hire.
196 
197 There isn't a thug alive that is a match for Salazar. Fast 
198 Freddie is to independent to be dependable. I recommend the 
199 Outsider.

201 If you need any more help from the McKane organization just 
202 let me know. We aim to please.

210 I've recommended you for a glamorous, adventurous, job as a 
211 private detective. If you land the job you can earn extra 
212 money by reporting to me any information you come across about 
213 the Phoenix Egg.
214 
215 Didn't I tell you that good things happen to LeRoy McKane's 
216 friends? You can depend on the McKane organization when you 
217 need it. LeRoy McKane is a man you can trust.

223 CHEEMINY!  I go away for a day, and all manner or new people show up!
224 (But then again, I'm new myself.)  Thugs for hire, outsiders, and
225 who knows what else!  And I still haven't met Pam, either!!!!!
226 Anyway, I am strictly suspicious of this McKane fellow.  Strikes me that
227 he is putting a few too many self-serving message about.  But I agree
228 with Cmdr. Lacells of the Regulon (aka latter day Davey Crockett) that
229 these split and shifting realities can be a bit unnerving.  Besides,
230 I don't really want to meet the wizard anyway!  And I' not sure if

237 only that, but so many  these uglies seem to be angry at me. I 
238 certainly didn't want to take that pill, I didn't want this trouble.

240     I just wish
241     I wish
242     I WISH I NEVER HAD THE REALITY PILL!

244     I felt a bit better, and turned to the commander. "You think McKane
245 is the one your after?" I smirked, YOU better hope not. He's more
246 than you could ever handle. And don't get too careless with the gun,
247 LeRoy takes care of his friends."
248 
249    I looked over at the others. Strange, the piper seems to be shifting
250 slightly.  I wonder which reality he'll end up in.

290 Dear Dr. Frankenstupe:
291 
292 An unexpected political situation suddenly required Mr. McKane 
293 to focus his attention on his South American business 
294 interests. In Mr. McKane's absence I have been authorized to 
295 speak in his interest.
296 
297 Mr. McKane has become the victum of a highly sophisticated, 
298 slanderous, and devious attack on his character. This 
299 unwarranted attack of one of the worlds leading citizens has 
300 been perpetuated by a radical band of Albanian fanatics.
301 
302 The rumor concerning Mr. McKane's mother is an excellent 
303 example of the kind of insideous propaganda that plagues this 
304 respected citizen. Mr. McKane has never sold an immediate 
305 relative for less than $50,000. Furthermore, he doesn't even 
306 know how to ride a camel, much less six of them.
307 
308 If you are interested in joining our crusade to battle this 
309 form of insideous psychological terrorism there could be a 
310 place for you in the McKane organization. Please let me know 
311 if you are interested in this noble cause. 
312 
313 Albanian terrorism is a terrible thing. It will take diligent
314 effort if we are free PAM and make the world safe for freedom, 
315 democracy, and cute fuzzy little animals.

425 Dearest Monsieur d'Autun:
426 
427     I too am outraged at the extremely infantile campaign of slander 
428 and malice being directed at the obviously irreproachable Mr. McKane.
429 Being a lover of fuzzy things and small personal weapons myself,
430 I am distressed to see Mr. McKane so viciously attacked when he cannot
431 defend himself. I would be delighted to join the McKane organization
432 and help eliminate the perpetrator of these nefarious acts.
433                                          Eagerly awaiting your reply,
434                                                  Mr. Tim
435 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
436 Dear Mr. French guy;
437      I'm sorry to say I won't be joining the McKane organization.  He's
438 too slippery for my tastes.  Besides I like to sit back and analyse, not
439 get involved.  Wasn't McKane involved in the theft of 10,000 Barbie dolls
440 from the Children's Orphage a couple of years ago?  Just wondering.

445      It seems to me I remember something about that episode.
446 Didn't he take the Ken dolls too and try to sell them to the
447 Iranians as pigmy mercenaries? I never did hear what he did
448 with all those barbie dolls though, did you happen to hear?
449      I never was too fond of that guy especially after he
450 renigded on that contract and I had to hire the British to 
451 do the job instead.

482 Mr. Tim
483 Outsider
484 
485 Congratulations
486 
487 You have been accepted into the McKane organization. As 
488 crusaders against Albanian progaganda and terrorism your lives 
489 will now take on added meaning and purpose. I'm sure your 
490 friends and family are proud and happy for you.
491 
492 Your first assignment is to infiltrate the Albanian 
493 Revolutionary Party. Gather whatever information you can about 
494 Albanian terrorism, the Phoenix Egg, or the abduction of PAM 
495 and report back to me. Your loyalty and right-thinking 
496 patriotism will be well rewarded.
497 
498 Accomplish this task and you are on your way towards earning 
499 your first warm fuzzy animal. Good Luck.

505    I suddenly felt much better.  Reality shifting can be
506 very tiring.  
507    Ok, guys, as long as the state of the universe is slightly
508 stable at the moment, I have a few questions:
509     1) Where is everyone going?
510     2) why are you all going there?
511     3) why the sudden intrest in fuzzy animals?
512        (although I do like the suckers)
513     4) commander:whose side are you on anyway?
514 
515      I better get another ale and a seat before I hear this one.

520    I like fuzzy animals too. everyone needs a fuzzy animal some time.
521 But what is the connection to Mckane?  Is he running for office and hoping
522 to get the humane society vote?

526 
527 OUTSIDER: You needn't be concerned about Jonathan Chance's 
528 threat about getting killed if you are on two payrolls. The 
529 McKane organization is a non-profit charitable trust. Though 
530 you will recieve substantial performance bonuses there is no 
531 payroll so you are in no immediate danger.
532 
533 Since the McKane organization offers full back-up support for 
534 its agents I'll give you some help on your assignment for Mr. 
535 Chance.
536 
537 1) Mohammed Wassir has PAM. He will deny it but it is true.
538 
539 2) Salazar, Wassir, Serena work closely with the Albanian 
540 terrorists. Fast Fred, the Bard, and Rudolf Hess are suspected 
541 sympathizers. 
542 
543 I hope this is helpful. Good Luck.

548 
549 Dr. Frankenstupe & Rudolph:
550 
551 The blatant misinformation you are spreading about the Barbie 
552 Doll affair is another example of vicious lies designed to 
553 besmirch the good name of McKane.
554 
555 The truth is that the director of the Orphanage Association 
556 approached Mr. McKane concerning a Barbie Doll shortage that 
557 was breaking the hearts of the poor underprivledged little 
558 waifs. Mr. McKane, always the good citizen, collected 10,000
559 Kens and 10,000 Barbies and arranged for them to be married.
560 
561 After the ceremony the dolls were taken for a romantic honey- 
562 moon in the African bush. With the assistance of fertility 
563 rites performed by the Pigmy Shaman the dolls proliferated, 
564 making it possible for the unfortunate little children to all 
565 have a doll.
566 
567 Once again, Mr. McKane's goodness of heart has been destorted 
568 for the evil purposes of the Alabanian Revolution. I know that 
569 you gentlemen are probably innocent dupes who were taken in by 
570 this highly sophisticated campaign of lies. However, I beg 
571 that in the future you think twice before repeating such 
572 slanderous and misleading information.
573 
574                        Thank You
575 
576                        Monsieur d'Autun
577 
578 :*************************************************************:
579 Dear Mr. d'Autun:
580      I do believe that the reason the McKane organization is non-profit is
581 because Leroy skims all the profits  right off the top.  As for the dolls,
582 delivery must be delayed.  The little kiddies at the Orphanage haven't 
583 received them yet.  Wassir may be a terrorist, but he's kind to his mother.

605 My dearest Leroy;
606      What's the score chum.  I thought we parted on friendly terms, but of
607 late I've noticed a smear campaign against the ALBANIAN REVOLUTIONARY PARTY
608 and myself.  This in intolerable.  If this continues I will have to take
609 action with extreme prejudice (get the hint, scumball).  Salazar is unaware
610 that you are in the area, but I'm sure he would be very interested in your
611 location.  Both you and I know you're not in South America, so give me a
612 break before I break your arm.  Also please don't send those amatuers in
613 my direction.  I hate to waste innocents.  As for Pam, I ain't got her, but
614 if I do; you'll be the first to know.
615                                             With warmest regards,
616                                             Mohammed Wassir
617                                             <The Irate Albanian>
618  Now, if I can only find my way out of this nasty forest.  Who just flew
619 over on that broom?
620 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
621 Mr. McKane;
622 #338 reporting. Observation continues; situation is same: unstable and
623 without direction. When reality settles to index-.05 I shall resume the
624 operation. Unusual static levels on this level; contact on level j-3*^
625 from now on.
