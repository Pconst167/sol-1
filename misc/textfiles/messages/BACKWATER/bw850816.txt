7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privately owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system. As the system is
10 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
11 I may find offensive. Because of the limited size of the system, it will be
12 periodically purged of messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
13 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out of the
14 ENTER mode. The message is automatically stored. If after entering the
15 message you find you made a mistake, use the replace command to replace
16 the line. To exit from the system, type 'OFF' then hang up.
17 Type 'HELP' to see other commands that are available on the system.

20 SCOTT: from the command prompt when you first get on, type "CC N" this will
21 show the control S's everyone is telling you about. It appears to be some 
22 sort of bug in your terminal software since it is filling the line with them,
23 What is happening is that your software is sending a XOFF (the control S), but
24 since BWMS doesn't recognize the character as anything other then a regular
25 character, it echos it back, so your software sends another to try to stop
26 BWMS from sending those nasty things, so BWMS echos them because it thinks 
27 you want to enter them...... until the line gets full, then BWMS starts seg
28 bells to let you know that the line is full. You need to find out why the 
29 control S is being sent.

44 I am calling from Eugene, I was wondering how the job situation is up there.
45 I just graduated from Lane Community College with a 2 year degree in Computer
46 Programming.  Is there jobs for programmers?  Also I was wondering if there
47 any user groups for Apples up there (I have an Apple ][e).  I think this board
48 is really different, but it does the job. What is it run on? Can you do 1200 
49 Baud? It would help my phone bill if you can.

63 Okay! Enough! No more Mr. Niceguy. Responsibility. Yes, think about it.
64 That strange concept few think about and even fewer practice. No one
65 takes responsibility. It's not my fault, I don't work in that department.
66 I can't take responsibility for that. You'll have to get someone else to
67 help you. How typical. Shrug, shirk, shrink away. It's not my problem.
68 NO! I want you to take responsibility. I want to take responsibility too.
69 We must go forth hand in hand, never again to blame another, but to
70 instead admit our guilt. Time enough has passed without paying the dues
71 that our owed for life. We can not continue on the present path of self-
72 ishness. No more, no more, it is time to service the debt, and clean the
73 slate, and try, yes at least try, to start anew. Can we try? Will you
74 try? Yes I will try. Now, let us. Please, we must try. It is now or never.

103 depressing problems with a multiple author story -- we aren't keeping it

124     The pale orange sun struggled futilely to make its way past
125 the grey mist.  A cock crowed, and inside the small shack, the
126 sole inhabitant, a youth of eighteen stirred.  Reluctant to leave
127 his warm bed, he half-consciously shuddered as his feet hit the
128 cold stone floor.  He walked over to the basin, poured some water
129 from the pitcher into it, and then splashed a handful into his
130 groggy eyes.  His mind still filled with thoughts of sleep, he 
131 shrugged and poured the remainder of the water over his head.
132 Today was no time to be groggy, for it was the annual day for 
133 examinations to the academy--examinations that were the only hope
134 for those too poor to make their way on anything but merit.
135      He moved thoughtfully over to the fireplace, and poked the 
136 coals into a small fire.  Adding some kindling, he hung the 
137 kettle on its hook.  While he waited for the water to boil, he
138 quickly finished dressing.  He gathered the two fresh eggs from
139 the henhouse, and fried them with some bacon from the larder.  He
140 could only eat about half his meal, his stomach too nervous to 
141 hold much besides the strong tea.  He dumped the rest of the food
142 on the ground for the hens, washed the plate and pan, and sat down
143 for one last cup of tea.  He struggled to control his thoughts--
144 he saw himself placing first on the list of scholars, then he 
145 worried about finishing last, his mind fluttering back and forth
146 between the two extremes.  "Enough!" he yelled at himself.  "I
147 will do my best--and that is all any man can do."  Shouldering his
148 bag and pocketing his uncle's pipe, he set off to test himself.

184 SADLEY, THE SUMMER IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE. THE SUN'S PLACE IN THE SKY IS CHANGING
185 , SHIFTING TO WHERE IT'S LIGHT NO LONGER PROVIDES THE VIGOROUS WARMTH OF THE
186 MIDSUMMER. RESIDUAL HEAT STILL KEEPS THE BITE OF THE COLD AWAY, BUT EACH DAY
187 WINTER SUCKS THAT MUCH MORE ENERGY AWAY FROM THE HEATSTORE. ANOTHER SUMMER GONE.
188 AND, WHY DO I FEEL AS THOUGH EACH YEAR I ACCOMPLISH LESS, ENJOY THE SUMMER LESS?
189 IS IT BECAUSE AS I GROW OLDER I HAVE LESS TIME FOR DAYDREAMING, LYING IN THE SUN 
190 AND HAVE MORE RESPONSIBILITIES TO MEET? MORE WORK AND MONEY I HAVE TO GET? WHY
191 MUST I WORK MONTHS TO BUY AND SUPPORT A HOUSE, CAR AND OTHER PERIPERAL ITEMS?
192 ALL THESE DO IS TO HELP ME TO WORK BETTER, MAKE MORE MONEY TO BUY A BETTER CAR
193 BUY A BETTER HOUSE, MORE THINGS THAT TAKE
194 MORE OF MY TIME AWAY. AS I GROW OLDER, I FIND THAT MY TIME IS LESS AND LESS MY
195 OWN. IT IS OTHERS. AND EVEN THEN, OTHERS ALSO LOSE MORE OF THEIR TIME TO ME. 
196 THIS IS NOT A FAIR TRADE OFF, I WOULD GLADLY GIVE THEM THEIR TIME BACK, IF I COULD
197 EVEN GET A SMALL AMOUNT OF MY OWN FROM THEM. OTHER PEOPLE, TOO WOULD LIKE THIS.
198 ALL OF US, LIVE OTHERS LIVES. STILL, I HAVE MY SCOPE, MY VISION OF MYSELF, OTHERS
199 OFTEN LOSE THEIRS. MANY PEOPLE, LOSE TOUCH WITH THEMSELVES, IS IT BECAUSE TO LOOK
200 AT YOURSELF IS UNBERABLE? BECAUSE YOU CANNOT EVER GET BACK TO WHAT YOU HAVE LOST
201 AND TO FORGET THIS YOU IGNORE YOURSELF? I NEVER WANT TO BECOME LIKE THIS. EVEN IF
202 ALL MY LIFE IS GONE TO OTHER PEOPLE, I STILL WANT TO LOOK AT MYSELF AND SEE
203  EVEN IF IT MAKES ME CRY.

212       You could not have been more correct in the statement that
213 times here are no longer follow that which was once a predictable

229 Piper et al:  I personally would like to continue this adventure, if at
230     possible.  I haven't entered anything lately in hopes that others
231     would feel compelled to write.  Maybe we need some direction?  I think
232     that if one of us could get a hold of as many of the others as he/she
233     knows, we could make some decisions as to what course to take; follow
234     the entity?  land on and explore Trainor's home planet?  Let's get some
235     excitement into our adventure!  Trainor, I imagine that you know most
236     of us...  I hate to saddle you with the responsibility, but how about
237     calling and confering with some of the adventurers.  I also think that
238     we all should try to come up with at least one entry to the story each
239     week.  Comments?  I'll be back on later this evening with an entry of
240     my own...

251 	Trainor greeted the two new adventurers in the commons room, and
252 then returned to the control room. He surveyed the activities of those
253 around him, and noticed a strange complacency had befallen the band of
254 adventurers.
255  	"Friends! What has happened? Bard? You have not said anything for
256 several minutes. Piper? You look downcast beyond the ravages of your
257 medicines. Emu? You stand in the corner and lurk. You act as if you wanted
258 to say something, but you remain silent. Lady Tyree? You too are
259 strangly quiet, so different from what you were before. Tin Man and Fencer,
260 so new to our adventure, but still so silent. I ask again, what has
261 happened? Have we lost sight of that which has drawn us together? Are we to
262 stand aside and let this evil destroy all that we know? I have already lost
263 my planet, but it is not too late for you. But we must act and act
264 swiftly. A group can not function as a group unless all the members act
265 accordingly. We must not lose sight of our goal. We must not forget that
266 the universe depends on us. We are the last bastion the Realities have."
267 	Trainor appeared drained from his empassioned speach. He sunk down
268 onto some cushions behind the main control chairs. He was silent, as were
269 the rest of the adventurers. The Pell-mell floated in trans-reality.
270 Trainor's planet, or what was left of it, was only a few realities away.
271 The path the creature from ZEB had torn a path through the fabric of space,
272 a path that could be followed by the Pell-mell. The question was would the
273 Pell-mell follow? Would it visit the planet to see the destruction the
274 ZEB creature could havoc? Can the diverse and talanted group of people
275 overcome their problems, and return to the group that looked so promising
276 at the beginning of the quest? As always, unanswered questions; questions
277 that could only be answered by the voice of all, or the voice of none.

281 Responsibility and Illusion, so each partakes of the other, in
282 turn, as colors shift to the mind's eye. Yellow is Red and Black
283 is White, but the gathering gloom surrounds all in its embrace, an
284 embrace of death. Daylight fades as the onrush of the darkness
285 overtakes all in its path. The analogy is clear, but the actions
286 to take are not. What should the responsible person due to avoid
287 the effects of such an occurrence? As the gloom that approaches
288 us gains despite our best intentions, clouded are the choices
289 we can make. d, your words smack of a need for the same thing
290 when we look deep into ourselves, we all need. It goes without
291 saying that needs unmet are acids untreated to our psyches.

308     "We're sorry, Trainor.  I don't know about the others, but I was
309 thinking about the significance, the importance of our journey."  Emu
310 was the first to respond to Trainor's plea, then went right back to 
311 work.  "Apogee in the 300 degree range, Bard."
312     "Check.  Coming in from the jump; one more jump before planet-
313 fall.  Bringing in inertial damp..."  Bard's voice trailed off.
314     "Bard, would you check your stream modulators?  We're gatting a huge
315 flux in the ship's gravity."  Emu held himself in place as he felt him-
316 self rapidly lose weight, and just as rapidly regain it.  At the same
317 time, in another part of the ship, Fencer found out why special toilets
318 are needed in zero-gee environments.
319     Whan Bard didn't answer, Emu turned to look at him.  Following his
320 wide-eyed stare, he caught the fading glimmer that was where Piper had
321 been standing.  The pretty blue and green bubbles of light boiled and
322 popped, falling slowly into themselves, finally disappearing with a
323 distinct "pop".
324     "gods almighty..."  Lady Tayree gasped.
325     "By the wings of Ariel," Bard cried, "I've never seen that before.
326 Quick Emu, can you trace Piper with your tracker?  I'll hold our position
327 here."
328     Emu started at Bard's words, then realized what he had said.  "Uh, yeah
329 , hold on ..."  He turned and started tuning for Piper.  Setting for line
330 input, he tied the tracker to the ship's scanners.  On a strong hunch, he
331 first scanned the area of the ZEB creature.  Sure enough, Piper's trace
332 was there, right in the middle of the entity.  The tracker showed that
333 Piper's brain waves were near-normal, except for a disturbing intermittent
334 dip in the alpha activity.
335     Tin Man came rushing in, followed closely by Fencer, who was wiping
336 something from his tunic, and Cragmore, who was trying to control Fencer's
337 dog.  The dog was evidently very disturbed by the sudden grav shifts, as
338 was everyone.
339     "What happened?" demanded Trainor.
340     Lady Tayree nervously explained.  "piper and i were watching the viewin
341 g screens, when he started to shimmer.  i tried to grab him, but there was
342 nothing solid to hold.  the shimmer started bubbling in reds and yellows,
343 then changed to greens and blues.  then he was gone..."
344     "I've got him on the scanners, now..." Emu continued, "... and he
345 seems to be okay.  Believe it or not, he's right in the middle of our
346 friendly neighborhood anomaly."
347     Bard looked at Cragmore.  "You've got psi background, don't you?  Can
348 you contact Piper, find out what's happening?"
349     "I can try.  Can you give me an idea where and when he is in relation
350 to us?"
351     "Our time, and only five parsecs distant.  Can you work with that?"

355 Yes, the dark winds of approaching gloom can be frightening indeed. How 
356 to avoid them, how to make the decisions that must be made? Look deep 
357 into your soul, listen to your feelings. Be true to yourself. Fear of 
358 risk, fear of choosing wrong, fear of being hurt; these are what inhibit 
359 the choice. The longer the decisions are put off, the closer and faster 
360 the darkness comes. To do what is right for yourself. What is right? How 
361 can we know that the choice made is the proper one? Life is a series of 
362 risks. We can only listen to our feelings, and make the best choice we 
363 can. When we hide behind our mask of fear we only hurt ourselves.

404   Tin was feeling a bit bewildered, and a bit light headed as well, but that
405 was due to the ships gravity problem (or maybe that whiff of scotch).  He 
406 was lost as to the reasons behind the fade-out of their companion, but the 
407 gravity problem was a bit more along his line.  After a bit of snooping it 
408 became obvious that somehow a bit of hair or fur had been caught in one of the
409 control contacts.  The dog was not to blame, the colors didn't match.
410   "I've located the problem with the ships gravity.  Everyone hold on to some-
411 thing, I've got to turn the system off for a seco 
412 (line noise).. to get things working again.  And someone grab the dog.  Giving
413 everyone a moment to anchor themselves, he cut the power to the gravity control
414 and pulled the offending contact to clean it off.  It took a bit longer than 
415 the promised second, but in less than a minute he had the contact back and the
416 power restored.  
417   "Well, that's that.  Now where did I put that poem...."

420     such gloomy words... such gloomy thoughts... perhaps... the subject makes
421 the gloom... of course this is all speculation... as are my grades next year
422 and my friends...

424     allean checked his watch... the three dials rotated... a minute had just
425 passed in algiers... benghazi... and cairo... technometers are sometimes too
426 flashy... sometimes too accurate... tilean grimaced at the click the watch
427 made... it was beginning to annoy the other agents...
428     they stood at the airport... gray cement stretched out flatly for yards...
429 then the desert stretched ever farther... someone clicked their heels... a
430 tie flew up in the breeze... sall four agents waited...
431     finally a jeep arrived... it turned a tight circle and some men wearing
432 arab costumes... straight out of the movies... hopped out and shuffled the
433 agents into the jeep... it turned tightly once again and sped down the flat
434 desert floor...
435     tilean spoke to one of them... the other agents could not understand...
436 he was making travel arrangements... getting each agent where he ought to go
437 and when he ought to be... except himself... he would stay in the oasis...
438     the oasis loomed above them... the trail of dust dispersed as the jeep
439 slowed... the palm trees towered above them... and they had entered maradan
440 oasis... the people from the market were chattering loudly... and the kids
441 playing in the street made even more... it is hard to hear yourself think in
442 maradan... the jeep slowed...
443     the brakes squealed to a slow stop in front of the International Club...
444 one of the building erected by the nazis during the war... and kept open by
445 the many visitors to maradan... after all... where would they know to have
446 each other assassinated...
447     flies descended upon the jeep... everyone hopped off... allean's watch
448 clicked again... the arabs stood as if they did not know where to go... then
449 tilean realized... the arabs may not enter the International Club... that is
450 only for those of european or far east descent...
451     tilean led the way into the club... his hand pulled aside the soft cloak
452 the covered the entrance... the dampness flooded out at him... the sunlight
453 flooded past him... into the club... his agents found their way inside...
454 tilean let go of the cloak... and everyone resumed chatting...
455     a man with a turned up nose arrived at the scene... he wore a tuxedo...
456 in stark contrast to the primitive entrance.. he asked about a reservation...
457 soon they were seated at a table and waiting to be told where to go...

458     the whole series of events... passed without a word...

466   The piper swam in what seemed to be a soft grey fog.  At first, there was
467 the slight sensation of a breeze -- a feeling of motion, either of himself or
468 the medium surrounding him.  Later, whether he simply stopped moving, moved
469 with the wind, or stopped feeling it, the sensation of motion stopped.
470 The tempurature was not hot, not cold -- no sensations reached his skin.  The
471 unrelieved grey seemed to soak into his eyes, a thick, uniformly illuminated
472 fog of undetermined thickness.  The light and heat seemed unvarying, a thick
473 sensation of incredible ennui.
474   Only gradually did the piper begin to realize a change.  Tiring of the
475 monotony of the grey fog (the piper was a firm believer that when something
476 occured, one should wait patiently if possible until the situation became
477 more clear) the piper began rummaging by touch in his sporran.  His fingers
478 seemed to have almost no sensation.  Lifting his hands, the piper was
479 greeted by almost no changes in the soft grey surrounding him.
480   A sharp bolt of fear filled the piper.  He placed his palms tightly over
481 his eyes, and could see only a slight darkening of the greyness that surrounded
482 him.  Working from memory rather than a sense of touch, he reached up for 
483 his earlobe, grasped it tightly and twisted.  He was rewarded by only a slight
484 sensation of pressure, a nearly undetectable twinge.

494 Depression is so relative. A presence with a conscience will
495 quickly realize that there is more to life than nights of white
496 satin and days of blue sky and sunshine. We will not stay this
497 way forever, but as a temporal state it is indeed important
498 to justify its existance. We are not always to ask questions,
499 just as we are not always to accept. As in all things, a mix

523 	"Emu, I hope you can do something FAST. From these readings it looks
524 like Piper's sensory inputs are damped *way* down. At least as bad as a
525 sensory deprivation tank..."
526        Bard's thoughts flashed back over the years (all too many) to his
527 training. He remembered the 'tank'. I f you goofed on your co-ordinates
528 you might *literally* wind up 'nowhere'. Thus the tank sessions, to give
529 you a chance to work out how to operate without sensory feedback.

534 Sonic Screwdriver (sa'-ik skroo'-driv-er) n.: A small device commonly used
535 for manipulative work.  Uses vary, but include disintergrating small objects
536 (.5 cm^3 or smaller), and manipulation of objects without actual physical 
537 contact.  Noted to be exceedingly useful in the opening of locks of all sorts.
538 [Exerpted from Encyclopedia Dementica, a Gallifreyan publication, circa 2650]
539 ++++++++++++++++++++
540 The Doctor had little trouble with the lock, and we gained the foyer.  The
541 interior of the house struck me as odd- for there was no furnishings.  Scrap
542 papers scuttled back and forth across the floor, as if hurrying to find the
543 remainder of their comrades.  Perhaps the wind that followed us through the
544 door was really to blame.  Whatever the cause, one scrap in particular caught
545 my eye, and I grabbed for it.  It read:
546 [Translated from the Latin, which is in no manner like the Latin of this line
547 anyway, to a rough approximation of English]
548 A Proclamation, the Seven Thousand Four Hundred Fifty-Eighth such made by Our
549 Esteemed Leader, Yule Frenbunder:
550 On this day of June 15, the Frenbunder estate will be evacuated, and all
551 objects within moved to the nearest suitable estate, until such time as the
552 Odd and Exceedingly Strange Occurances in that vicinity cease.  Patrols will
553 inspect an area about the estate on a daily basis, in search of evidence to the
554 effect that the Occurances have Indeed ceased.
555 [Signed, in an exceedingly lavish and gaudy manner, Yule Frenbunder]
556 "An explanation, Doctor.  What we seek is truly within."  I gave him the notice
557 so he could read for himself.  He scratched his head, and gazed at it.  I
558 snatched it back and read it to him.  I'd forgotten the Doctor's inability 
559 with languages.  (It rarely showed, but sometimes it was a severe handicap.
560 Once he had tried to barter with a group of Cinsdians for a new scarf, and
561 ended up calling the trader a 'erduhslytum'- an insult incomprehensible in
562 English but unforgivable when dealing with a Cinsdian.  It was three days 
563 before I could persuade their chief not to saute' him, and three more before
564 they released him.)
565 We set to work.  The ground floor and two upper stories produced nothing, but
566 our luck changed in the basement.
567 Off to the left side of the damp chamber, a black oval hovered slightly above
568 the concrete floor.  It was utterly
569 black, not the variety that reflected light somewhat.  This ABSORBED it.
570 "A Convolution, something I had not expected to see in my lifetime.  This is
571 the source of those presences I have felt, Doctor.  This is a direct pipeline,
572 a duct, through time, space, planes, and lines.  The TARDIS brought us here,
573 supposedly, because this is the nearest outlet.  I wasn't sure such a thing was
574 possible until now.  To directly span all the dimensions at once, and to
575 maintain it... the energy!"
576 "Hold it, I'm trying to figure the equivalents in my head.  Er, the output of
577 two good-sized G stars would do it."  The Doctor stopped.  "We're going to
578 mess with something that can harness THAT sort of energy?"
579 "Unless you have a better idea."
580 "Well......", the Doctor began.

583     "I think I can reach him, if he's not too far out." Cragmore emerged 
584 from a storage room where he had been examining some of the Pell-mell art-
585 work in more detail. "If I can grab piper in psi, we should be able to
586 guide the ship using Emu's device and my directions."
587     Gragmore settled down on the metal floor of the ship. He pressed his
588 back hard against the wall, his neck and head in perfect alignment with
589 his spinal column. He closed his eyes tightly, and a look of incredible
590 concentration spread across his darkened face. For another moment he was
591 motionless, and then his outstretched arms began to curl inward towards
592 his chest. Sweat began to form on Cragmore's brow. His hands spread out
593 until the fingers were as wide as his joints would allow. He pressed them
594 together in an isometric manner, and then sat still again. No sound, no
595 movement, for several moments, until, "I see him... I am near him. Piper!
596 Piper! Can you hear me? Look out, ignore what your body tells you and 
597 listen to your mind. The mind's eye! The third eye! Listen and see. Piper!
