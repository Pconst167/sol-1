85 
86 
87 A number of recent messages from newcomers showed an interest 
88 in learning more about what Backwater Messages is all about. 
89 Though relatively new myself I've picked up enough information 
90 to give a fair idea of what's going on. I'll leave it to the 
91 oldtimers to jump in and correct any factual errors I might 
92 make.
93 
94 It is a fascinating story that begins in the middle east. For 
95 many years Syria's President Hafez Assad wasn't concerned 
96 about having a strong intelligence presence in the United 
97 States. However, with he growing American presence in Lebanon 
98 he grew alarmed at his inablity to get solid intelligence 
99 about the west.
100 
101 He decided he needed a network of agents familiar enough 
102 with western mores and cultural values to make sense of 
103 the psychology of American Imperialism. To train his new 
104 agents he turned to an independent American arms dealer who 
105 who dealt in computer equipment on the side. Between the two 
106 of them they set up the network you are now monitoring.
107 
108 Across America there are 165 computer bullitin boards 
109 similar to Backwater Messages that are used for the training 
110 of Syrian Agents. Up to 80% of participants of systems like 
111 Backwater are Americans. The remaining 20% are "characters" 
112 controlled by Syrian agents, who in turn are controlled by 
113 Soviet psychologists trained in high tech foriegn espionage. 
114 
115 Each Syrian spy has four characters, each with a different 
116 personality, that he manipulates to learn American response 
117 patterns. Each agent is controled by a Psychologist who 
118 supervises all entries and monitors all American reactions.
119 
120 In following Backwater Messages it can be difficult to tell 
121 the Americans from the Syrians.
122 
123 Here are some tips:
124 
125        1) Because Syria has a limited number of 
126        educated people they must recruit agents 
127        from the aristocracy. Consequently, Syrian
128        agents are often arrogant and rude...though 
129        not always.
130 
131        2) Syrian agents can sometimes be spotted 
132        by their limited sense of humor and abhorance
133        of anything imaginative.
134 
135        3) Syrian Agents can not speak Pig Latin
136 
137 
138 I hope this information has been helpful to those of you who 
139 are new. If you have any further questions feel free to ask.

233 HEY.... LIKE THAT'S REAL HEAVY MAN!........
234 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
235      well, so far you people have done nothing to impress me. 
236 Don't bother reponding to that coment because I will never read it. This is the first and last time I ever come here again.
237 
238 :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::mucked up:::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::
239 
240 WELL NOW!
241 
242 FIRST OF ALL I NOTICE HOW THE LAST TEN MESSAGES OR SO HAVE BEEN SPRINKLED
243 EVERY OTHER MESSAGE OR SO BY A LITTLE FUNNY MARK LIKE THE ONE MY MODEM
244 MAKES WHEN THE CARRIER BREAKS. ON SOME KEYBOARDS THIS IS THE CHARACTER
245 FOR 'APPROXIMATELY'. FROM THE WAY THEY APPEARED, I GUESS THAT IS THE 
246 MARK SOMEBODIES TERMINAL MAKES WHEN THEY TRY TO ERASE SOMETHING, AND THEY
247 ARE NOT AWARE THAT THE TEXT IS NOT BEING ERASED. THIS  MEANS THAT ALL OF
248 THOSE MESSAGES MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT BY THE SAME PERSON. ALSO I NOTE THAT
249 NATASHA, BIG BILL BROOZY AND SO ON HAVE DISSAPPEARED (MUCH TO OUR DISMAY,
250 I'M SURE)(I LIKED 'EM ANYWAY) BUT THAT THE GRAND DRAGONMASTER MAKES
251 LITTLE BOXES AND THINGS JUST LIKE BIG BILLS BOXES. 
252 
253 SO I THINK WE HAVE HERE MAYBE TWO PEOPLE TALKING THROUGH TEN CHARACTERS
254 EACH, OR MAYBE JUST ONE BODY WITH TWENTY PERSONALITIES WHO ONLY GET
255 TOGETHER HERE ON BWMS.
256 
257 IF THERE REALLY IS JUST ONE PERSON AND TWENTY PERSONALITIES, IT FIGURES
258 THAT THE PERSON IN QUESTION IS ACCUSING THE REST OF US OF BEING MESSED
259 UP. PEOPLE USUALLY THINK THE OTHER PERSON IS MESSED UP, NO MATTER WHAT.
260 PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO CHANGE MUCH, EVEN IF THEY SUFFER FROM
261 DODECAPERSONALITONIA (GIVEN BY MY DICTIONARY AS 'HAVING EITHER
262 TWENTY OR TWELVE PERSONALITIES, DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT')
263 
264 WHAT REALLY UPSETS ME IS BEING MADE A DUPE BY THE SYRIANS. I AM SURE THEY
265 PLANTED THE NOTICE FROM THE 'ALBANIANS'. I AM SO UPSET THAT I AM GOING 
266 TO WRITE A LETTER TO THE SYRIAN AMBASSADOR IN PROTEST, IN FACT. IN 
267 MY LETTER I WILL GIVE THE AMBASSADOR A GOOD TONGUE LASHING. THAT
268 WILL CERTAINLY SHOW HIM.
269 
270 WHICH WAY DID THEY GO, GEORGE? WHICH WAY DID THEY GO?
271 
272 AN INTELLIGENT PERSON MAY SHOW A DISPOSITION TO GIVE ANY IDEA A FAIR TRIAL,
273 CONSIDERING EVEN THE MOST REDICULOUS IDEA IN DETAIL BEFORE REJECTING
274 IT. THIS IS KNOWN AS BEING OPEN MINDED.
275 
276 A CROCKER SPANIEL CAN BE VERY OPEN MINDED AND INTELLIGENT, I THINK.
277 AT LEAST, WHENEVER I DISCUSS THE SOUND OF ONE HAND CLAPPING WITH MY 
278 CROCKER SPANIEL, OR REQUIRE HIM TO CONSIDER SOME OF MERLYN'S IDEAS
279 ABOUT PHILOSOPHY AND MEANINGFUL DISCOURSE, MY CROCKER SPANIEL LOOKS
280 VERY INTELLIGENT INDEED. 
281 
282 HE NEVER REJECTS AN IDEA OUT OF HAND, OR WALKS AWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF
283 A RANT I AM GIVING. HE APPEARS TO HANG ON EACH AND EVERY WORD I 
284 AM SAYING, GIVING ME A VERY THOUGHTFUL, EVEN YOU MIGHT SAY A
285 VERY PERPLEXED LOOK. AFTER I AM DONE, HE GOES OVER TO HIS FAVORITE RUG
286 TO SIT AND THINK ABOUT IT ALL. SOMETIMES HE CAN REALLY THINK UP A 
287 STORM. WHEN HE REALLY THINKS HARD HE DOESN'T MOVE AT ALL FOR
288 LONG PERIODS OF TIME, EXCEPT TO SCRATCH AND TAKE A LOT OF THOSE DEEP
289 DOGGY BREATHS THAT THEY TAKE WHEN THEY ARE LAYING ON THERE SIDES 
290 WITH THEIR TONGUES HANGING OUT LIKE BIG PINK SLUGS.
291 
292 MY DOGGIE IS AT THE VETRINARIANS NOW. HE WAS THINKING OVER SOME OF 
293 THAT HEAVY ZEN-TYPE STUFF I LAID ON HIM LIKE "EVERYTHING I TELL YOU
294 IS A LIE" THAT I GOT FROM MERLYN. AFTER A WHILE HE WAS THINKING 
295 REALLY HARD AND I NOTICED HE WAS REALLY QUIET. 
296 
297 OH,OH, I THOUGHT. TO MUCH SATORI, OR SOMETHING. 
298 
299 THE VET SAYS HE IS IN A COMA. PRETTY SOON I WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ON
300 WHETHER TO PULL THE PLUG ON ALL THOSE RESPIRATORS, PLASMA DRIPS, AND
301 OTHER THINGS THAT ARE KEEPING HIM GOING. I AM HOPING I WON'T HAVE TO GO
302 BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT OR THE ASPCA OR THE ANTI-VIVISECTION LEAGUE
303 OR SOME GROUP OF WELL MEANING SOLONS LIKE THAT.
304 
305 ANYWAY, I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER CALL UP AND WARN YOU ALL BEFORE IT'S
306 TOO LATE. THERE APPEARS TO BE A DRAWBACK TO BEING A LITTLE TOO OPEN 
307 MINDED. I HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS.
308 
309 1) IF YOU RUN INTO THE PHRASE "THINK ABOUT IT", DON'T.
310 
311 2) IF YOU READ THE PHRASE "I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT...", DON'T
312    LET THEM TELL YOU. THEY'LL FEEL BETTER, TOO.
313 
314 3) FINALLY, IF SOMEONE DECIDES YOU'RE TOO DUMB TO TALK TO ANY MORE,
315    DON'T TRY TO TALK THEM OUT OF QUITTING. MAYBE YOU ARE TOO DUMB.
316    IF SO, YOU COULD END UP LIKE MY DOGGIE. I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT HE
317    MIGHT BE TOO DUMB TO EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS HEAVY STUFF TO, BUT I
318    DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART TO BE HONEST WITH HIM ABOUT IT, HONEST LIKE
319    SOME PEOPLE ARE WITH ME. AND JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. 
320 
321 I FEEL SO ASHAMED.
322 
323 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HROTHGAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
324 THIS IS ANDY, THANKS FOER THE INFO ON THE CARTOON SETS, I NEVER
325 WOULD HAVE GUESSED. JUST NOW THOUGH, I THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.
326 DID YOU EVER NOTICE HOW WHEN YOU THING~K ABOUT YOUR TOES
327 INSIDE OF YOUR SHOES THAT YOU END UP GETTING IN FRENZY TRI~YING TO GET
328 YOUR TOES OUT. IT IS LIKE THEY WERE TRAPPED AGAINST THEIR WILL IN
329 YOUR SHOES. WHY IS THIS? I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.
330 DO YOU EVER NOTICE ALL THOSE LITTLE FUZZ BALLS ON YOUR GOOD DRESS SOCKS?
331 WHERE DO THEY COME FROM? THEY CAN'T COME FROM THE MATERIAL
332 OR THEY WOULD BE ON THE INSIDE TOO. THIS IS HARS~D FOR
333 ME TO COMPREHEND.

359 UNCLE DOESN'T LIKE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT ALL THE NASTY THINGS HE'S
360 DONE AND OR IS DOING, SO HE KEEPS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO
361 REVOLK THE NP STATUS. AS I REMEMBER THE SUB RATE IS $15 WITH A
362 PER ISSUE COST OF $2. OH YES, IF YOU DO SUBSCRIBE YOU WILL FIND
363 YOUR NAME ON EVERY LIBITARIAN MAILING LIST IN THE COUNTRY, BUT,
364 EVEN THAT CAN BE INTERESTING AS YOU CAN GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE
365 LIBITARIAN VIEW POINT. OF COURSE GIVEN THE VARIED PAST YOU DESCRIBE,
366 I WOULDN'T BE SUPRISED IF YOUR NAME HAS FOUND ITS WAY TO ONE OF 
367 THE LISTS ANYWAY, YOU SEEM TO GO FOR A LOT OF UNUSUAL READING!
368 BY THE WAY, MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THE 'GOVERNMENTS VERSION
369 OF THE TRUTH' WAS WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL WRITING A TERM PAPE
370 ON THE PUEBLO CRISIS. I USED RADIO HAVANA AS A ALTERNATE SOURCE
371 OF INFORMATION TO FIND OUT WHAT THE OTHER SIDE WAS SAYING. MY
372 TEACHER WAS IMPRESSED AND GAVE ME A B- DESPITE THAT THE PAPER
373 WAS BARELY WORTH A 'C' IN REALITY, HE GAVE ME THE EXTRA FOR
374 USING MY IMAGINATION AND EXPLORING REAL ALTERNATE POINTS OF VIEW
375 INSTEAD OF JUST GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND COPYING WHAT SOMEONE ELSE
376 WROTE. EVER SINCE THEN I'VE ALWAYS TAKEN THE 'OFFICAL WORD' WITH
377 A BIT OF SCEPTICISIM.
378 OH YES, THE '~' IS CALLED A TILDA IN CASE YOU WANTED TO KNOW.

402 
403 HROTHGAR:
404 
405 I was flattered that you took the time to speculate about my 
406 characters. You were partly correct. I do not have hundreds of 
407 characters. I have only four, Grand Dragonmaster, Natasha, Big 
408 Bill Broozy, and LeRoy McKane. Occassionally I'll leave an 
409 unnamed message if I feel it might help the flow.
410 
411 I'm glad you enjoyed Natasha and Big Bill...that seems to make 
412 two of us.
413 
414 LeRoy was my first character. He was the one I used to try to 
415 figure out what was, and was not, appropriate for this board. 
416 I retired him because he kept drawing too much flack. I guess 
417 he taught me what not to do.
418 
419 When I got real tired of LeRoy's bickering I introduced the 
420 GRAND DRAGON MASTER as a peaceful alternative. The Grand D. is 
421 my attempt to create a character that is a "gentleman". The

425 I am hoping to find kindred spirits among the members of the 
426 Inn who can share my delight in imagination. Some days are 
427 more discouraging than others.
428 
429 Sorry to hear about your dog. When that happened to my dog I 
430 took care of it by reading to him from "China Reconstructs". 
431 It worked wonders for his health but he now barks with an 
432 oriental accent.

442        Andy:
443 
444            External sock fuzz balls are created when 
445        toes, attempting to excape from shoes, scrape 
446        inside sock material. The reason the balls are
447        not on the inside is because you have your socks 
448        on inside-out.
449 
450 
451             Don't tell the Albanian Firebrand that I told 
452        you this, but the answer to his question is...
453         "To blow up basket balls".

460 Hrothgar:I have just remembered an interesting item in a letter from
461 someone living in Switzerland (member of club I belong to). They said that 
462 in Switzerland, indeed in most of Europe, you must pick your child's name 
463 from a list of approved names! Being Americans, they were exempt but it was 
464 mentioned to them when they had their kid a few months back. Considering the
465 name they gave their kid I _almost_ agree with the approved name list idea.
466 (They named him "Kodiak Starwolf Firesmith", Firesmith being their last 
467 name. Isn't that a TERRIBLE thing to saddle a kid with?)

470 Greetings and salutations.  I have noticed that this message
471 system can be easily described to my non-computer friends as
472 a long roll of toilet paper sitting on a table next to a
473 single pen.  Every so often someone comes along, scans back along
474 the roll, and reads until the end, then writes some additional
475 comment with the pen, then returns the roll back to its resting
476 place.  No significance to this comment... I just thought
477 that you might like to hear the metaphor in my mind about
478 this thing.  Today is an odd-numbered day, yet I have nothing
479 profound to say.  Why?  Must be because I was up too late
480 last nite.  So, I'll shuddup.  Sorry about your dog.  Dog's
481 already have zen, you don't need to give it to them.  FIrst
482 mistake.  (Or last, it's hard to tell.)  Definitely an
483 appropriate action, to try to clap one hand above a dog.  They
484 can't do it.  Puts 'em into shock, it does.  Then, their
485 poor little doggie mind gets blown.  Oh well, so much
486 for dogs.  Catch most of you later....

511 Certainly an interesting metaphor, toilet paper. And it does apply to your
512 writing, Merlyn, since most of it seems to have been entered in the manner
513 that toilet paper is used. Your writing really wipes me out!

552 Alex:  My roommate has a Swampscott Dory.  He had it made to order, so I think
553 it's the only one Schooner Creek made.  We sail mostly from the boat dock at
554 48th and Marine and from Rooster Rock.  No name on the boat.  We also spent
555 a week sailing in the San Juans last year.  Fantasic experience.  If you
556 haven't tried it, I'd highly recommend it.      DP

564      HROTHGAR, YOU ARE QUITE CORRECT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR EFFECT THIS
565 MEDIUM HAS, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL BBS HAS MUCH EFFECT BE-
566 YOND THE MINDS OF ITS USERS (AND IN SOME CASES, NOT EVEN THAT, AS THE NEW
567 GENERATION OF ECCENTRICS AND EGOMANIACS COMING TO THE INN DEMONSTRATES).
568      SO YOU WORKED FOR THE "UNDERGROUND" PRESS IN PORTLAND!  WAS IT THE IN-
569 FAMOUS WILLAMETTE BRIDGE?  I USED TO READ A NUMBER OF SUCH PUBLICATIONS
570 (SUCH AS THE BERKELEY BARB AND THE L.A. FREE PRESS) UNTIL THESE BECAME MERE
571 TRASH.  THE STATE OF "ALTERNATIVE" PRESS IN AMERICA IS PITIFUL, AS MOST SUCH
572 PAPERS HAVE DISSAPEARED (THANK YOU, AGNEW!).  I STILL READ MOTHER JONES,
573 THOUGH.  WERE YOU A "NATTERING NABOB OF NEGATIVISM"?
574      THOMAS PAINE, EH?  I WASN'T AWARE THAT ANYBODY READ HIM THESE DAYS!  HE
575 IS STILL VERY RADICAL, AND I'M NOT AT ALL SURPRISED THAT HIS WRITINGS ARE SO
576 HARD TO FIND.  HAVE YOU READ "COMMON SENSE" OR "ESSAYS ON THE RIGHTS OF MAN"?
577                                        
578      POPS, THANKS FOR THE COMPLIMENTS (TWICE, EVEN!)!  YES, PRAVDA CAN BE
579 VERY DULL, ESPECIALLY BY COMPARISON TO THE FLASH AND GLITTER OF AMERICAN
580 NEWS.  BUT IT'S NICE TO KNOW WHAT THE OTHER GUY IS SAYING, EVEN IF YOU DON'T
581 BELIEVE A WORD OF IT OTHER PEOPLE DO, AND YOU MUST BE PREPARED IF YOU WISH
582 TO ARGUE A POINT.
