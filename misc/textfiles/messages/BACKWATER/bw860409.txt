76    The Hell Machine
77          (6)
78    
79    Jean sat up slowly, blinking the sleep out of her eyes. The clock read 7:51. She clicked off the alarm. Quietly she
80 got out of the bed, trying to disturb Frank's sleep as little as possible. Not bothering with a robe, she padded out
81 into the front room naked.
82    She opened the curtain on the big floor-to-ceiling picture window, letting the sun flood the room. She gazed out
83 over the magnificent view of Portland from his home high up Rocky Butte. The sun hung over the west hills. She stood
84 there for a long moment, letting the warming rays bathe over her body. The window was made of one-way glass, so she
85 wasn't giving anybody a free show. Still, the feeling of exhibitionism was delicious, made all the more so by the fact
86 that nobody could really see her. Something was bothering her, but she couldn't put a finger on it.
87    Things had pretty much settled in the month since Mt. Hood had disappeared. The estimated death toll had been around
88 twelve thousand, and everybody was thankful it hadn't been much higher. One death, though, had hit very close to home.
89 The police had found Roy's truck on the 205 bridge with a wrecked transmission. Coast guard boats had found him
90 floating face down several miles downriver. Apparently he had been walking when the shockwave from the mountain's
91 disappearance had blown him over the barricade. Jean felt a little tug in her throat when she thought of it. Despite
92 his irresponsibility, they had all liked him.
93    Except for Frank, she didn't see too much of the others. Norbert was working on some kind of new power source that
94 NASA had contracted Mechtronix to develop for their proposed space station. Doug was back at his job washing dishes for
95 a diner somewhere on Sandy Blvd. Frank was working on a design for a new high-speed CPU that could give a micro speed
96 to rival a Cray. If it worked out, he could kiss off Mechtronix and their slave wages to open his own business. Hell,
97 in a year he could probably buy them out. Jean herself had been offered a teaching position at PSU and she was
98 considering taking it. Somehow the thought of staying around that place seemed unbearable.
99    She had been spending more nights here than at her own home lately. Not surprising. Since the Mt. Hood incident she
100 had a definite aversion to being alone. Alone, the ghosts of the dead would haunt her sleep. Frank understood this
101 feeling very well, and offered to put her up in his guest room. She hadn't intended to wind up in his bed, but after a
102 while it seemed to be inevitable. He was strong, sensitive, intelligent, funny (sometimes)... she couldn't name all of
103 it but she had been attracted to him almost from the beginning. Not to mention he was great in bed. She smiled at the
104 memory of the previous night.
105    But ghosts haunted his sleep, too. Ghosts of a different kind. At night she would sometimes be awakened by his
106 thrashing and moaning. What little she could make out of his words had something to do with guns and madmen. In the
107 daytime he would pass it off as just a nightmare and say nothing more. But high on his left bicep was an ugly scar that
108 might have been from a bullet. She dropped the subject, hoping eventually he would relent and talk about it. Whatever
109 it was, it must have been terrible. And the worst scars were where nobody could see them.
110    She stretched luxuriously. The sun felt wonderful. Something was still bothering her, though. How could anything be
111 wrong on a beautiful morning like this? The birds were singing outside, there wasn't a cloud in the sky, and the sun
112 hung like a giant golden orb in the west...
113    West?
114    She glanced sharply over at the wall clock. A little after eight. And the sun was just a little over the west hills.
115 It was unreal but so natural that she froze for a second, her heart pounding rapidly. Finally the spell broke and she
116 ran to the bedroom screaming for Frank.
117    Nobody else found anything strange about a western sunrise, or at least that was the impression the news gave. They
118 flipped through all the channels back and forth for two hours, finally settling on CNN Headline news. They had features
119 on war, murder, political corruption, Halley's Comet--but nothing about the sunrise. It was as if things had always
120 been this way. An oppressive feeling of unreality settled down over the both of them. Were they going crazy?
121    There was a knock at the door. Frank went over to answer it. It was Norbert. "Hi." He peeked around Frank, "Hi,
122 Jean." He opened his mouth to say something else and the stopped with a puzzled look on his face. "What is this, a
123 nudist convention or what?"
124    They both looked down at themselves and remembered that neither had thought to put anything on in the excitement.
125 Visitors had been the last thing on their minds. Jean yelped and ducked into the bedroom. Frank followed her close
126 behind (so to speak). He was more self-concious than she was, because he knew that Norbert was AC/DC. From the front
127 door, Norbert called out loudly, "I'm glad to hear you're not. I've had my fill of strangeness for one day and it's not
128 even lunch yet."
129    Jean came out tying the sash on her robe. "You noticed it too. The sunrise, I mean."
130    "Yep," Norbert replied, "Me and no one else. Took me an hour before I thought to ask you people."
131    Frank came out, fully dressed and wearing a jacket. He ignored the funny look they both gave him. "We're in big
132 trouble, you know. The whole world is."
133    "Tell me about it. I thought it began and ended with the mountain. Apparently we weren't so lucky."
134    Jean looked at them both, confused. "What are you talking about."
135    Norbert turned to her. "At a guess, my dear, we have undermined the fabric of reality with our little experiment.
136 All the clues point to it. I've been watching carefully and there's been some subtle random changes around here along
137 with the obvious ones. We've screwed up the universe."
138    Frank sighed, "And I don't see how we can fix it."

178 As I clentched my sword in the black of the night, I felt the mighty warrior rush towards me.  His sword in hand

182 damn, hey sysop, get rid of these lines, !!!! NOW!!!!
183 
184 
185 Ok, Take 3.....
186 
187 As I clentched my sword in the darkness of the night, the mighty warrior rushed towards me with all his force, his mace dangling188 in front of him, and his sword in the other hand.  I only had one weapon to fight this mighty beast, my sword, no shield...just 189 the sword.  He ran toward me like a runaway train, I held my sword straight in front of me waiting for this Knight, He pulled
190 his mace up high and struck me with it, my sword flew out of my
191 hands and into the dirt, I was doomed,  I saw him full plated 
192 armored & dangerous, he threw his mace straight at me, I ducked
193 but it was no good, his mace struck me as I fell to the ground
194 I felt great pain as I stopped to touch my wound.  I felt blood
195 run down my lip , I had the power to scramble for my feet as I
196 saw him running again, He picked up his mace and hearled it to-
197 ward me with all his might, I tried to duck again, but now it
198 was straight for my heart, again I felt the blow of the mighty
199 mace againts my body, blood everywhere as I fell to the ground
200 for I was in terrible agony, above I could hear is laugh...
201 "Ha, YOU FOOL, YOU ARE NO MATCH FOR ME!" then silence struck
202 he got on his horse and rushed away to kill more............

206 Tempter - Did you spend a long time on that entry? I know how difficult it is
207 to pay attention to a story after the third week of editing, but it pays back
208 in spades. Things like, noticing the way wounds act in real life, and dealing
209 with abstracts as important parts of life, are important in storywriting. But
210 the twist ending finished the story well, so your instincts are fine.
211 Look at this! I am suggesting writing styles eight months after enroling into
212 the creative writing class! Do ignore me, but I did like the story.

266 Dear Mr. Silverman....
267 
268 Have you seen the film " The Quiet Earth?" It's story bears strong parralels to
269 yours. I think that you would enjoy it. On the subject of films, has anyone seen
270 " Brazil "? It is THE BEST FILM  EVER! I mean that sincerely and from the bottom
271 of my heart. When I was but a slip of a girl, I thought that STAR WARS was
272 pretty neat, but ah, the follies of youth. GO  SEE BRAZIL TODAY!!
273   I was pretty ticked when it didn't win any oscars. It should have been up for
274 best picture.
275   "Highlander" is about the WORST sci fi film iv'e seen in a long time. All it 
276 is is a chance for Sean Connery to wear a red velvet doublet and say a lot  
277 mystical junk. The guy that plays the Higlander.. He has one stock expression 
278 that covers every emotion. It is supposed to be smoking, eternal knowledge and
279 thinly controlled inner tempest. Instead, it looks as if he needs an analyst.
280   Hey! I should go on tv like them other guys and review movies for fun and
281 profit. Maybe i'd get to meet all the stars, or be like Ted Mahar of Corey (ugh)
282 Brunish. ( I have no reason to dislike the man, but for his odious appearances
283 during thePbs festival breaks. He alwaysseems to end up right after Dr Who, and
284 is condecending...." Boy, you Whovians out there! I wonder if the TARDIS is for
285 real <Yuk Yuk>..But seriously folks.." Give it up corey.)
286  Anyhow, forgive my loquacity and verbosity, but after a hard day, one's fingers
287 tend to want to loosen up and get down.
288   Here with  all your favorite film reviews.....

326 Mr. Dougnut......
327 Throught out the last couple of weeks,
328 I have viewed this board and its
329 arguments about religeon and I have
330 something to say to you, Dougnut:
331 I have seen God in you, more than
332 anyone I have met(or come close to meeting)before. I would also like to say
333 that this message system is a wonderful
334 utility,but it shouldn't be used to
335 put religeons down....
336 The Bible pleads for no one to put any
337 religeon down,even if it contradicts
338 your own........

360 Brazil: A picture that has captured the imagination of many. It is a total
361 concept movie; it builds a premise, a city, a world, characters, total
362 society, and it never, never fails its premise. It is a wonderfully
363 constructed film, not once cheating the viewer. The concepts presented are
364 fully developed, and no logical complaint about the completeness can be
365 leveled. 
366         It is for precisely those reasons the film will remain a stigma on
367 the art of film making. A contradiction you say? Quite the opposite; my
368 premise follows exactly the one set down in the film. Brazil is devoid of
369 the milk (however you may think it) of human kindness. There is no love
370 that can not be defeated. Conscience has been cut from the mind. It is as
371 black as any void. Hope which sparks is doused. The strongest propoganda
372 was never so effective in drawing the lines of a world and filling in the
373 bleak colors between those lines. A hero will evaporate before the bright
374 onslaught of the bureaucratics. Brightness does not exist.
375         Brazil makes its point. No one can deny that. The effect of the
376 point on people who open themselves to the experience is powerful. Those
377 who enter a theater and never allow the visions within will never under-
378 stand why Brazil is one of the worst films ever made, and in being so, is
379 one of the best films ever made.

383 voyeur: It seems that you've kept careful count, and I have blindly taken the
384 word of my issue of the Pulsar.  Security at the BPA auditorium says it's next
385 week, my Pulsar says today.  I wonder how many other people will try to attend
386 the meeting that isn't there?
387 I shall miss the meet on the 19th, also- the PSUACM programming contest falls
388 on that date; I have already made arrangements for it.  Double Drat.
389 Any other suggestions?  L'homme?
390 Emu: I've got a copy of the EE homework for you, XOR and XNOR gates.  Yawn.
391 See you Monday?
392 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Milch, 12 Apr 86, 2:46pm ++++++++++++++++++
393 Milchar: dig out your Pulsar. Look at the back page (the one with the 
394 mailing label on it). In the lower left corner is a sticker with some
395 blurred felt pen writing on it. If you squint & examine it carefully
396 you may be able to make out the words:
397 APRIL FOOL! CHECK MEETING DATES

410 Milchar: OUCH!  You found out the truth by actually appearing at the BPA Audit.?
411 	 I sure hope the Pulsar editor appreciates his little jest.  Never having
412 	 quite gotten around to joining PorSFiS, I've never received a Pulsar,
413 	 so I've never been led astray by their bizarre sense of humor. (or 
414 	 regaled by notices of moving parties and whatever other useful 
415 	 information may be contained within.)
416 	 Since this board was filled up with CRs for the past couple days,
417 	 Leonard left me the correct info on CBBS/NW.  I hoped you would see the
418 	 message there, but alas you seem to have missed it.  Well, we can all
419 	 commiserate with you at your forthcoming orgy-cum-Saturnalia.  Looking
420 	 forward to it.

505 By the way, if anyone decides to leave me a message blasting me for MY poor spe

520 are at it you might try just typing at the prompt to see what ctrl chars

532      Getting up from the small terminal that belonged in the room joining
533 mine, I headed for the elevator and tried to put the previous weeks work
534 behind me.  Either I was getting better at slipping away undetected, or
535 they were letting me get away from the Plaza now and then just for the
536 heck of it.  The elevator arrived, I entered.
537      I pressed the button for the rest area and leaned back against the
538 far wall before my transport had a chance to start moving.  Just as I
539 braced myself I began to feel the vertigo; I never liked these fast
540 elevators on single bit.  It stopped almost as quickly and soon had one
541 less passenger to contend with.
542      Regaining my composure ever so gracefully, I strolled over to the
543 never-lit hearth and removed an instrument from over the mantle.
544      "I hope this is not only for show.  It could be oh so powerful if
545 it has been maintained properly..."
546      As I began to inspect it carefully, memories washed over me of times
547 long gone...  well not so long ago.  Automatic weapons freshly refilled
548 with "thirty little buddies" just waiting to rout the Communist threat
549 within the backward villages on the border of my precious homeland.
550 Flames in the darkness, shrilling cries in the sight of the setting sun.
551 Hot flying lead rapidly finding new homes in valiant opressors.  They
552 were the irresistable force and we were the immovable objects.  The
553 flames, the smoke, yet always the crying fire.  It was soon to become my
554 constant nightmare.
555      Friendly off-road bonfires were the one saving grace of the sight of
556 fire.  The fellowship shared in song with brothers was just the ticket
557 to relieve the strain.  Music hath ways, thank God they worked.
558      
559      Now alone I sit near the fireplace that sheds no light.  Dark is the
560 night except for the fluorescent rays seeping in from the hallway.  And
561 silent is the night except for the sounds I strive to pull from the
562 balalaika in my grasp.  If my fingers could but remember how...

567 New movie review time.
568 I just saw " BLISS " today. Well, it is a visually stunning film, done in 
569 beautiful, spring like ccolors. Flowers bloom eveywhere, and this is rather 
570 disconcertingly nice in comparison tthe sort of things ththat go on around tthem
571 BLISS is not your kind of film if you do not like sex scenes. The sex in this f
572 film is quituite overt in places, and overt in places you would not expect, succ
573 as a restraunt full of people. There re is also quuite a bit of bloody gory 
574 stuff.
575 	As to story. It is confusing, difficult to follow the major ooutline. But
576 the way it is done in small parts is quite wonderful. It also has a way of 
577 drawing you in to a rising interest from a rather slow start. It is very heavily
578 symbolic, and will leave yoou sorting othe meanings out long after you leave the
579 theater.
580 	Bliss has been compared to BRAZIL. Well, you all know this reviewers feeling   
581 about aforementioned film, so I will not draw comparisons. But I w  Will say tha
582 Bliss is worth your money.
583 	NEXT WEEK:::
584  	I Will be reviewing ttthe new movie LEDGEND. I can't wait to see it.

589 To Leonard..
590 It is I tthat isxperiencing such troubles w just got the modem on my 
591 Osborne to work and am trying tto use it instread of my regular C. ^64 modem
592 because I like the keyboard better. But ofdd things keep happening to me. When
593 I try to use the arrow keys to backspace and erase, they erase, but when     
594 review what I haveerased, it has a nasty habit of stuttering. (As youoou can see
595 in ththe first half of entry above.) Alson, using control H to erase works, but 
596 often that Control function will skip letters. AnIs thhere any special stetting
597 I should be using to transmit? I am using Amcall program and a Datacom modem.
598 Any advice   would be apreciated.

606 who promised to never again log onto this system would simply keep their
607 promises.
608 (((((((((((((((())))))))))))))))
609 but if they kept their promises, they wouldn't be twits, now would they?
