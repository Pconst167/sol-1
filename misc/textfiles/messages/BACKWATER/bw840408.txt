67 In all honesty I eschew violence. Not for any deep philosophical reason or from squeamishness, but because I used 
68 to be a very violent person. It took my nearly killing someone to make me go through the years of therapy it took
69 to make me the relatively peaceful man I am now. I used no gun, I nearly ripped his lower jaw off with my bare hands.
70 I'm no great bruiser, either: 5ft 7in and 155lbs after a heavy meal. I suppose my point is that the problem isn't 
71 gun control, it's SELF control. As long as there are individuals in a society who are unwilling to take adult r
72 responsiblilty for their actions, there will be killing and maiming, whether from crime, auto accidents, or 
73 whatever. The solution must begin in the way we raise our children. 
74              && The Mad Actor &&
75 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
76   Ahh yes -- this discussion has run it's course.  I must agree with the 
77 mad actor -- there are no dangerous weapons, only dangerous people.  Society
78 has a number of more or less effective ways of instilling "proper" behaviour
79 in children, but the majority of their behaviour is taught by their peers.  If
80 their peers esteem behaviour that you or I would not like, tough, that's what
81 they learn.  Churches used to teach morality and the "correct" behaviour, but
82 if a child is sent to a fundamentalist church he seems to be taught that any
83 questioning of  a serious nature is sinful and will send him to hell.  Slammed
84 in the face with that, most kids cave in.  With more maturity, comes a reaction
85 against that type of church.  (I'm getting over mine -- I can tolerate the
86 vocally religous now, but with distaste.)  
87 Well folk -- time for a new topic, a new adventure or whatever.  As stated
88 before, If needed to get a topic going, I'll take either side of an issue.
89 Some of the best discussions that I have been involved in were those that
90 I held a side other than the one I would have chosen out of conviction.
91 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

93 #######################################
94 Ever notice that no matter what we choose to discuss here it always gets back
95 to religion? I thought we had gone over that subject with a fine tooth comb.
96 But now I see that even Gun control is the job of the Church! When, oh when
97 will people be responsible for themselves and get rid of all the mumbo-jumbo of
98 organized religion!!!! What we need are enforceable laws and ways to enforce
99 them to put the fear of MAN into the criminal. As I said before and it bears
100 repeating "Anyone caught with an unliscenced firearm (hand or otherwise) 
101 would face a mandatory sentance with no hope of parole or plea bargaining."
102 Those using a weapon (regardless of type) in the commision of a crime would 
103 automatically be guilty of a felony and should get ten to life. We must remembe
104 that even the worst criminal wants his freedom and I feel that a certain 
105 justice is the only deterent.
106 
107 ##############C.Y.M.##################################4/4/84 8:53am############
108 CYM:Please note that until we get enforceable & ACTUALLY ENFORCE them,
109 we will have trouble. & until we have had them in effect for quite a while
110 (say a couple of generations) we are going to need LOTS of prison space!
111 And guards etc. No one wants to pay for these things now.....

131 The Battle Hymn of the Ranapublic (words: John Boardman)
132 Mine ears have heard the croaking of the Giant Barded Frogs.
133 They are swimming through the marshes, they are leaping over logs.
134 They are eagerly devouring people, vampire bats, and dogs,
135 As they go hopping on!
136 Chorus:Glory, glory, ribbit, ribbit! (note: ribbits are spoken,not sung)
137 Glory, glory, ribbit, ribbit!
138 Glory, glory, ribbit, ribbit!
139 As they go hopping on!
140 Their hides are leather shields on which a sword has never stung.
141 They have claws upon the forefeet, they have barbs upon the tongue
142 With which they torture women who are sensitive and young,
143 As they go hopping on!
144 CHORUS
145 They have armor-plated eyeballs and their teeth are made of brass,
146 Their breath corrodes titanium, their voices shatter glass,
147 They shoot snake venom from their jaws and napalm out their ass,
148 As they go hopping on!
149 CHORUS
150 They'll jump a seven-meter fence, they'll float like a ballon.
151 They'll swim like Flipper's brothers and they're fast as a typhoon.
152 In fact, they say that Armstrong found a couple on the Moon,
153 As they go hopping on!
154 CHORUS

164      I haven't been on the Electric Ark much since it changed
165 format,  but I some messages before that about it going to be
166 part of a network of computers  around the country  that send
167 information around  and automatically or something like that.
168   
169      There was also a message that the system sometimes runs
170 some sort of artificial intelligence programs that acts like
171 a person asking questions and responding to what the user is
172 typing. All that goes on is stored and can be read by people
173 on the system. I may have gotten that a little confused it's
174 been a few months ago. That's all I can tell you except that
175 I think there are some people here on the backwater that can
176 use it.

182 THERE ISN'T MUCH MORE TO BE SAID, SINCE IT'S ALREADY ALL BEEN SAID. HOW
183 ABOUT PARALLEL UNIVERSES? FOR INSTANCE- A FRIEND OF MINE USED TO KEEP
184 THE KEY TO HIS MOTORCYLCE LOOSE FROM THE REST OF HIS KEYS. ONE NIGHT
185 AFTER GETTIN TO WORK HE DROPPED THE KEY UPON A CEMENT RAMP LEADING UP TO
186 THE DOORS OF THE BUILDING. "TING!" AND THAT WAS THE LAST HE SAW OF THE KEY
187 FOR THREE AND ONE HALF WEEKS. WE SEARCHED ABOUT 40 SQUARE FEET, DRAGGED A
188 MAGNET ON THE GROUND AND EVEN CONTEMPLATED BORROWING A METAL DETECTOR. NO
189 SUCH LUCK AND NO KEY.  THEN ONE NIGHT THE BOSS CAME ALONG AND ASKED AL IF
190 HE HAD LOST A MOTORCYCLE KEY. "WHY, YES SAID AL, "BUT WE LOOKED ALL OVER
191 AND COULDN'T FIND IT!" "WELL BEGAN THE BOSS, " IFOUND THIS BIKE KEY LAYING
192 ON THE RAMP JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR." NOW, CAN ANYONE TELL ME HOW THAT KEY
193 JJUST LANDED ON THE CEMENT AND VANISHED? WE ALWAYS WALKED VERY CAREFULY 
194 ON THAT RAMP AFTER THAT. AFTER ALL, FALLING THROUGH A TIME DISCONTINUITY
195 ISN'T EXACTLY AFUN PROPISITION. SEE YOU ALL LATER!! F. FIN

199  Mikey,
200        I know that the BWMS is all in ROM ......... However would it be 
201 a great problem to alter the REPLACE command so that it could only be used 
202 on a line number greater than the one you logged in on ? 
203  
204 CYM,
205        There have been many studies ( references available ) to determine if 
206 strict penaltys and mandantory prison terms have any "deterrence factor".
207 In crimes that have been premeditated the effect has been moderate to marginal
208 and in crimes of "passion", the condition that most firearm related crimes
209 occure , the violent act has happened with little regard to the penaltys 
210 attached to the crime. Consider two hypothetical cases .
211    1. Average man comes home finds wife in a compromising situation with 
212 a dwarf, two pygmies and a donkey....in a fit of rage he shoots them all.
213    2. Deranged Satanist methodically kills three Benedictine monks with a 
214 shotgun over a period of three months .
215 Should both receieve the same sentence ? Should there be any consideration 
216 in either case as to motive ?  Sanity  ( temporary or otherwise ) ?
217                     Are they guilty of 1st Degree ?
218                                        2nd Degree ?
219                                         Wha

245  
246 To all adventurers...In the recent past we have gone from the Land o
247 f Oz(bourne) to Gun control, and almost back to religion! Now just where could
248 this dangerous course of events be leading us? Do we need someone bold and
249 imaginiative to lead us? Or should it be the individual adventurer who makes
250 a story and who ever wants to follow does? The death of imagination could
251 lead to an unhappy inn, and I don't think a giant frog, regardless of its
252 stature, is going to save us! Come on bold people! Raise up your swords, or
253 blasters, or songbooks, or pipes, let us again make another temptous journey
254 into the unknown, where danger lurks around every corner! 
255 Aaron, what do you say? Methinks an adventure into the inner workings of an
256 '11, to solve a strange hardware bug that could speel D O O M for mankind
257 as we know it sounds like fun for a saturday afternoon. We have all had
258 experience fighting hardware bugs. Its not like we are children being lead

383                               Gilbert Shelton
384                    from "The Hydrogen Bomb and Biochemical Warfare FUNNIES"
385            chapter "Wonder Warthog and the invasion of the PIGS from Uranus"
386                                     April 1970
387 of the ZAP COMIX genere..."Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers & F. F. cat!" too..
388   All: maybe a new topic (if not computer control)...say, the trend of 
389 today's youth. (being a member of that persuation, i will rephrase..)
390 The trend (of most of) todays youth (in the direction of self-destruction).
391 Has anyone recently had the displeasure of riding TRI-MET? Game for some
392 extra credit for anthropology 101? RIDE IN THE FAR BACK (on a decently 
393 travelled line...) what is this collection of organisms that lurk back here?
394 Examples of the future of the vast majority of today's young.....devolution.
395 sorry "de-evolution"...ignorant, rude, 100% motivated by their visceral 
396 sensations...or in good 'ol prude notation, PUNKS. What percentage of youth
397 today are Punks? 50%? 75%? who knows?? they want to grow up to be welders.
398 (ooops, sorry MIG, forgot about ENTER ONLY) rephrase: they want to be
399 any sort of grungy low tech profession that will support thier drug and
400 alcohol habits. are they the product of their peer influence? TV? parents?
401   Now, in the spirit of fair play and BW (and piper), i will, from this 
402 point on, advocate the pro-punk viewpoint......

406      oh we're off to see the wizard....
407          it seems that Aaron is intentionally trying to shock the
408         inn back to it's state of trans-reality cosmic camp-fire......
409 }
410 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
411    Aaron -- Gulp!  No, I've never ridden Tri-Met.  (The closest line runs
412 about 3 miles from my home.)  But to be consistent I need to research that
413 group don't I?  Ah -- a quote to the rescue --
414   "Consistency is the bugaboo of small minds."
415      --- (help! I've heard Emerson for this but don't have the source!)
416 I love it!!  I don't care who said it!!  I get to stay off the back of the
417 bus!! No extra costs (Tri-Met doesn't go anywhere that I do.)
418    If you care to research the subject I would be most interested in hearing
419 your findings.  Anything to stay off the back of the bus!!
420 Bard and Apprentice-- I wiil try to get to the meeting on Saturday.  I 
421 have no bizzare identifying features.  Will that make me stand out enough?
422 I no longer have a wearable kilt ... I suppose I could wear spats, but they
423 don't work as well for rain as sand.  Shall I throw my pipes in the truck?
424 (Yes, in the mundane world I do carry a set -- reality invariant however.)
425 Barring unforseen developments -- 
426 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
427 
428 =-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
429 Believe me piper, you really should do everything to keep off the bus.
430 I have to ride tri met regularly (probably punishment for a past life)
431 and stay far away from the front as possible. Especially during rush 
432 hour.  I ride west side lines so most of them aren't all that bad,
433 but you can imagine what it's like (or maybe you're lucky and you
434 can't)
435                           Bo
436 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
437 I must ride the bus when I visit this mundane world. (Hast THOU ever tried
438 to tell DMV that your address is c/o Goodgulf the wizard, route 2, Inisfall?
439 The rear portions of these conveyances are indeed strange, and their 
440 denizens wondrous. I frequently find myself wondering about them! I have on 
441 occasion wished that I could use my powers here, so that they would stop
442 removing the seats before I can use them....
443 ............................the apprentice..................................
444 Fast Freddie:We seem to have a problem here! I'm sure that something could 
445 be worked out regarding a place for you to meet the rest of us...
446 but it would require the use of voice, not modem! Any ideas? (I suspect that
447 you are about as willing to reveal your phone # online as I a. i.e NOT
448 VERY!)
449 Piper: Will look forward to seeing you! (You may have SEVERAL surprises in
450 store!)

478 Friends:
479 
480 Frederich Neitzsche said it best in his 1910 book The Will To 
481 Power.
482 
483      "...the fundemental tendency of the weak and 
484      mediocre of all time, has been to enfeeble the 
485      strong and to reduce them to the level of the 
486      weak: their chief weopon in this process was the 
487      moral principle."
488 
489 Neitzsche, Schopenhauer, Machiavelli, along with most 
490 western philosophers, acknowledge that lust for power 
491 is the motivating force behind history.
492 
493 From Genghis Khan cutting a swath of death and destruction 
494 through western civilization, to Hitler burning the 
495 Reichstag, to the Argentine terrorism of Mario Firmenich, 
496 the principle remains the same.
497 
498 History rewards those who rise above the moral principle to 
499 achieve their destinies through violence and deceit.
500 
501 The history of our nation is the history of war. The 
502 revolution, the civil war, WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam...these 
503 are the markers, the chapters, that define who we are, what
504 we're up to,...and why.
505 
506 Our prosperity, our freedom, our position in the world, are
507 built and maintained by our willingness to use a military 
508 reign of terror. We can not deny that we support the most 
509 costly military establishment in the history of the world.
510 And we are prepared to use it; we are using it now.
511 
512 Death and devastation are our national policy, our purpose, 
513 our destiny...and you don't have to miss out on it.
514 
515 I can give you a real deal on a half million AK assault 
516 rifles, ammunition enough for a medium sized invasion, and 
517 the technical assistance to get your army into the field.
518 
519 This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
520 
521 Here's your chance to fulfill your destiny, demonstrate your 
522 manliness, while impressing girls with your snazzy new uniform.
523 Military chic is IN. It's guys in uniform that get laid...don't
524 miss out on the action.
525 
526 Getting started in the exciting career of pillage and plunder 
527 is not as difficult as you might think.
528 
529 Fielding your own army merely involves placing thirty-six and 
530 a half million dollars, plus your business card, in a brown 
531 suitcase and placing it in locker 27 at the bus station.
532 
533 If someone has beaten you to locker 27 you can also use either 
534 38, 42, or 59.
535 
536 Upon receiving the cash I will promptly set you off on your 
537 new life of high adventure. Your life will never be the same.

547 MIKEY: I'll relay the message about the demo. I have one of your flyers
548 on COPYLINK, so we'll come prepared with good questions and some 
549 understanding of what the program does.
550 linda blair: Would you like to have me speak French to you for 10 minutes
551 and insult americans? It can be arranged, all you need to do is ask!
552 Leroy Mckane: Your offer might be tempting, but you seem to have gotten
553 yourself caught up in your old glory, and are neglecting the issues of
554 modern warfare. A conventional war CAN NOT be won with guns alone. Our
555 past experiences in warfare have proved that to win a war, superior air
556 power is a must. Also the ability to keep vital supply lines open. A
557 little defoliant is handy too, just don't spray your own men, or you'll
558 have a class action suit against you! A mobile quick-to-action unit is
559 also desireable. How about a fleet of tactical submarines, to wreck havoc
560 with enemy shipping, not to mention for spying purposes. What about
561 armoured support. Ground troops can be cut down without proper support
562 from heavy machinery. And you seemed to have left out artillery. Certainly
563 one of the most important options in today's conventional war. And last
564 but not least, several thousand Iranian children to act as mine sweepers
565 for advancing infantry. I'll tell you after watching a little Iraqi TV,
566 the results are certainly effective. I don't mean to criticize your offer,
567 but please in the future don't try to sell a war without backing it up
568 with some substantial forces behind it. Sure the price may go up, but
569 as we all know, "War may be hell, but it is also sure as hell expensive!"
570 !@#!@#
571 Aaron...The pro-punk side?!? Awright! I can't wait to hear this. I bet it
572 all stems from the time that good -lookin girl dressed up like boy-george
573 gave you the eye at Rose's right? "Are we not TRON?" Since you have
574 decided not to attend the same school I am, you are missing out on all
575 the overflow of high-schooler's from St. Mary's Acad...It's like being
576 in the west end of London every day!

583 SIGH! THE SAME OLE SAME OL'. FIRST WE FIGURE ALL IT TAKES IS FEW MILLION
584 DOLLARS (RUBLES, POUNDS, LIRE, ETC...) AND SOME ABLE BODIED BUT NOT 
585 BRIGHT KIDS {SOME OF THOSE PUNKS AS AN EXAMPLE} GIVE 'EM A COUPLE OF
586 MONTHS OF BASIC KILL SKILLS AND SEND THEM OFF TO WAR! WHAT FUN!! ON THE
587 OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN, HOWEVER, LURKS THE DREARY THOUGHT THAT MAYBE,JUST
588 MAYBE, WE DON'T WANT A WAR. IT MIGHT GET SHOVED DOWN OUR THROATS, BUT
589 WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME A WAR WAS VOTED ON BEFORE WE GOT INVOLVED? YET,
590 THAT ISN'T MY REAL CONCERN JUST NOW. LAST THING I REMEMBER WAS WALKING
591 UP THE RAMP TO WORK AND FALLING THROUGH THE CEMENT. WHERE AM I ANY WAY?
592 IS THIS THE FABLED LAND OF USED BOLOS AND WIZARDS? HOW COME EVERYTHING
593 SHIMMERS WHEN I MOVE? WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO GOOD, OLD FASHIONED REALITY?
594 AND LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, THE $64.98 QUESTION: WHO TOOK MY BLUE MOSS?!
