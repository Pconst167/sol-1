25 I saw my friend start.  "What is it ?" I asked, and he stared into the fire.
26 I gazed into it, and saw what I thought to be a familiar figure.  A skirl 
27 went through my conciousness.  It could be truth, or it could be just a
28 memory, playing tricks on us both.  If it were true, BackWater Inn is indeed

55 The words of love, the cries of hate,
56 And the man in the moon who seduced you
57 Then finally loosed you.

59 You climb upon a burnig rope to escape the mob below,

75       A spark! A mote before Cragmore's eyes. A face, familiar, but still to distant to be sure. A walk, unlike any
76 other's walk. Closer now, and memory began to form images of a lost friend. Was it? It was! Not scene since an
77 alien landscape, so harsh it nearly killed him. Piper.
78       Tears formed in Cragmore's eyes. Piper. Many adventures they had shared. And the last nearly saw Piper leave
79 this plain of existance. How mistaken Cragmore had been. To think Piper wanted to die! Oh, how could he have
80 thought such a thing. But the emotions Cragmore felt when Piper was near. The visions he experienced as Piper lay near
81 death in the Bard's craft. The woman from Zeb, forever gone, but never forgotten. All these feelings, yet they
82 were wrong. Tendrils of thought gone to a mistaken root. Hypothesis innaaccurate. Mistakes almost made.
83       Could Piper ever forget what almost was allowed to happen? Would Piper even respond to overtures of friendship?
84 Guilt causes a heavy burden on the shoulders of man. Cragmore bourne great guilt over what had happened.
85 Piper wants to die. He said it. He believed it. He was wrong, and Piper almost paid the price.
86       Cragmore slide down in his seat, pulling his wrap closer around him. He felt a chill, from the inside, not the 
87 outside. The fire made grotesque shadows dance on the walls. Cragmore was like a shadow. Present in site, but in form
88 something far far different.
89       He could hear the sound of bagpipes. Mind-locks went up. It would not be long now.

93    He stood there hovering over him.  He held the chainsaw firmly in his
94 sweating hands.  It started on the first pull and he wound the engine up to
95 a screaming pitch.  He forced the bar down into L'homme's flesh and the
96 blood shot up like a geyser.  He saw parts of blood vessels and muscle fly
97 accross the room and leave streaks down the wall.  He felt the blade hit
98 the first part of bone and continue on through.  Smoke rolled from the bar
99 as it forced its way through the bone and marrow.  Blood was now pouring
100 out of the sawed off leg like an ennema out of an old man.  He turned off
101 the chainsaw which was now covered in blood and bodily matter.  He reached
102 for the hammer and turned the claw on L'homme's stomach.  After a few
103 thrusts, blood made its way to the surface of the skin and he continued. 
104 After a large enough hole had been made, he reached in and broke the rib
105 cage as best he could with his hands and started hunting for vital organs. 
106 He found his intestines, and hung them carefully on a hook by the door.  He
107 was just about to put the lung in the same bucket that he had put the liver
108 in, when he heard a noise outside.  He quickly threw the remains of
109 L'homme's body into the brush shredder that he had there.  The liquid
110 remains sloshed into a garbage can that was at the exit of the shredder. 
111 He looked out the window and saw Mikey reaching for the doorbell.  He
112 jumped into the shower to wash off the blood and entrails that still
113 clinged to his body.  He hurried to open the door for Mikey and told him
114 that he had just gotten out of the shower and that L'homme hadn't arrived
115 yet.  Mikey looked comfortable and sat down in an easy chair in the middle
116 of the room.  While Mikey was sitting down, he didn't see the dark figure
117 sneeking up behind him.   He only heard the first part of his neck snap as
118 his spine was shattered instantly and a cloud of darkness covered his body.
119  He dragged Mikey into the bathroom where he had just finished L'homme's
120 body.
121 He stood there hovering over him.  He held the chainsaw firmly in his
122 sweating hands.  It started on the first pull and he wound the engine up to
123 a screaming pitch.  He forced the bar down into Mikey's flesh and the blood
124 shot up like a geyser.  He saw parts of blood vessels and muscle fly
125 accross the room and leave streaks down the wall.  He felt the blade hit
126 the first part of bone and continue on through.  Smoke rolled from the bar
127 as it forced its way through the bone.  Blood was now pouring out of the
128 sawed off leg like an ennema out of an old man.  He turned off the chainsaw
129 which was now covered in blood and bodily matter.  He reached for the
130 hammer and turned the claw on Mikey's stomach.  After a few thrusts, blood

144 <<<<<<<
145  Mr. Teller,
146 Needs some serious work.  The repetitiveness adds to the drama granted, but
147 perhaps the duplicate section is to long.  The ending is one of those 'You 
148 know what is next' or 'Make your own ending type of things.  I hate it. It
149 is unquestionably a cop-out on part of the author.  I have this same problem
150 with many of Francis F. Copola (sp?) films that end this way.  The use of 
151 familiar people ads to the interes of those people here on backwater, but
152 would abviously be unacceptable for the general public.  (some bad typos there)
153 So, rework that baby and give us an ending to grab onto.  One other thing that
154 makes itself rudely obvious is the fact that your vocabulary needs to be 
155 expandend.  It is a very graphic story, and the words describing this action
156 need to flourish and bloom with the gross action that goes on in the story.
157 I like a hard hitting story (poem?) like this.  It makes a beautiful statement
158 about today's world and today's people.
159 Thank you for giving us this glimps into the savage world that most of us pray
160 we never see.

202 The password that you gave me generates nothing.  I set 
203 all stop parity etc, it does communicate, but not effectively.  Is

211 The ship was shaken about by the waves around it. As the deck 
212 rose and fell, tides on the horizon did also. Since there was 
213 no shore in sight, the drab of the ship was the most attractive 
214 item to be seen. And to watch it made them seasick.
215  
216 Seth was the first into the launch. He held the map in a 
217 laminated sheet. The positions of the buoys and the ship were
218 marked out, along with the spot they were to dive. And they 
219 did. The ocean stung at first, the icy cold of the North Sea 
220 always does.
221  
222 A crevasse at the bottom hid the relic they were after. A red 
223 star on the conning tower and the aft section told them right 
224 away what they had found. Each one had a private radio link 
225 with a radio officer aboard the ship, and they reported the 
226 find simultaneously.
227  
228 As the two black suits swam closer to the wreckage, their 
229 carbon dioxide bubbles dispersed quickly. American and Soviet 
230 were enfolded into the wreckage and their bubbles were gone 
231 altogether. Their lives drifted into the darkness too.
232  
233 Seth sunk below the long beam of the sub and into the crevasse. 
234 Down there his light cast only a pinpoint of light. Seth worked 
235 to see what was on the sea floor. Equipment, gear, or, as he 
236 then found, corpses. Each with a Soviet naval uniform and a 
237 grimace of terror. Each long dead and waiting to be found.
238  
239 "Russian, what happened? Why did your sub go down?" Seth wanted 
240 to know why the crew had to die. With the Soviet at the helm. 
241 The radio officers aboard the ship relayed the question to 
242 Furtseva. Instead of waiting for the reply, Seth started to 
243 count corpses, then he noticed the orange raft hidden deep 
244 inside the crevasse.
245  
246 Furtseva swam around to the fore of the sub. The thin skin of 
247 metal was ripped, and the strong ribs of the vessel were 
248 collapsed on each other. Even the painted name was sliced off. 
249 Only the red star remained.
250  
251 The radio sprinkled a few words into the headset of Furtseva's 
252 wet suit. After thinking their meaning out, the Soviet thought 
253 out his answer in the most appropriate words. English was 
254 starting to suit him. In a halting accent, he sent the answer 
255 out to the American.
256  
257 "We were following the Norwegian ship on a course that would 
258 have taken it past a seaport in the Barrents Sea. One of those 
259 navigational errors that ends up being an intelligence boon, do 
260 you know?"
261  
262 Seth listened sternly as he swam to the orange raft.
263  
264 "We were about to warn it off when a pack of icebergs came from 
265 nowhere and crushed us. We never knew a second thing. A 
266 Canadian fishing ship rescued a few of us. And I decided to 
267 defect rather than face their families."
268  
269 Seth arrived at the life boat. It was on it's side in the 
270 narrowing of the crevasse. To pull it out would take some work. 
271 To delay the Soviet until he knew what this raft was, he asked 
272 why the icebergs were not seen before the collision. Then he 
273 tried to pull the raft out.
274  
275 "I do not know why we did not see them. Our sonar apparatus was 
276 in working order. The officer in charge of it was diligent and 
277 he had not lost the Norwegian in the hours we had tracked him." 
278 Furtseva hoped to drum up a comradeship with the American. "It 
279 is a riddle. That is why we are here, to answer it."
280  
281 Instead of answering, Seth started up to the sub. He knew the 
282 answer to this sad riddle.

289     With a horrible thud crashed the Pastor and with a shriek up flew the 
290 Pastor. alas every time the Pastor lands it is in a thorn bush. "At last
291 hard, solid ground, dirt no less." yelled the Pastor. Quickly he regretted
292 the yelled part. It seems that the Pastor was inside a clearing, walled
293 and ceiled, in the same berry bushes that had tattered the Pastors cloak.
294 checking for both his iron ring and any beast that the yells of a man in
295 main usually awake.
296     Finding the ring, intact and nothing trying to chew him; the Pastor 
297 took it as a good sign.
298     And he set out on his way. He chose to go north although he didn't 
299  now that at the time, all he knew was that he was getting hungry. He 
300 those that direction for the simple reason that was the way he was facing.
301 and that, was north.
302     That was stupid. the Pastor had been trying, in vain, to hold away 
303 very thorny branches in an attempt to save his eyes. His fine cloak and
304 even his en shredded, tattered.
305     His stomach was not, however, in pain at all. These berries were tasty 
306 and in abundance. Thorn berries plus thorns and endless branches to launch
307 them were in eternal abundance. I don't think, at this point in time, the
308 Pastor liked this reality.
309     And he had thought he might be going mad. The Pastor thought that he 
310 had heard motors and what not. and here it was. The Pastor was finally out
311 of the thorn patches. this, to the Pastor was proof that the two
312 conditions of his fall here, were indeed marks of a good omen.
313     With his typical efficiency the Pastor stepped back into the thorn 
314 patch just enough to obscure the citizen's view of him. But to allow him
315 to see the larger structures. The Pastor was on a concrete boardwalk
316 twenty or more feet from the water. A strip of grass and now, hated,
317 bushes were also on the beach.
318     There were several bridges, all varying in size and design, over the 
319 river. And a very dirty one at that. The accumulated smog led the Pastor
320 to believe that the seasons lasted year round. "Oh no!" the Pastor
321  quealed in intense discomfort.
322     "This is one those realities! Where ale gets back at you the next day. 
323 No, not one of those!". I know, at this point the Pastor did not like
324 this, or any other, reality.

329 Furtseva floated down the corridors of the sunken vessel. Those
330 who had not escaped floated at their posts in a ghastly
331 attendance to duty. He passed each of these posts to get to the
332 sonar chamber. Investigating the deaths of his ship and
333 crewmen, he almost wished to be dead also.
334  
335 he found the sonar chamber. The door was wheeled shut from the
336 inside. Scrapes at the sides of the door told him that there
337 had been attempts to pry the door of the hinge. Perhaps to help
338 the officer inside.
339  
340  sing the damages from the accident and the pressures, Furtseva 
341 entered the chamber. Rips in the side had opened only after the
342 rest of the crew was dead. What a liberty being alive was.
343  
344 Seth climbed a steel ladder to the conning tower, it was easier
345 than swimming. The hatch was open and he limberly climbed
346 inside. The warning signs and caution lights were in Russian,
347 there was no way he could find his way around by the signs.
348 time to wander.
349  
350 Furtseva slipped through the narrow slit in the wall. Inside
351 there was no one. The officer had left his post. For some
352 reason he was gone and in these waters, that was to doom the
353 sub to a collision with an iceberg. The absent idiot had
354 intended the accident, drowned the crew, and the sub.
355  
356 Furtseva said a word obscene to a Russian, but only weird to
357 the listening radio officer above. He tried to piece together
358 an image of the officer who had done this. Slim and dark
359 haired, he cut a dashing figure as a Naval officer. Transferred
360 from training in Arkangelsk, and Oslo. His name, it was
361 Johansen.
362  
363 Seth saw the bubbles filtering out of the sonar chamber. He
364 checked the time they had left in their tanks, an hour. It was
365 time to tell the Soviet what he had found and get them out of
366 there.
367  
368  Norwegian agent in Soviet navy. Treacherous murderer, trying 
369 to protect the secrecy of the Norwegian ship's course. That is
370 that these men died for, a trip past a harbor?" Furtseva threw
371 a chair against a wall. It came to a halt as soon as it left
372 his huge hands and landed on the metal floor. Things don't
373 throw very well in the deep.
374  
375 Seth slid all the way through the gash in the wall. He saw
376 Furtseva in the middle of the room standing alone. So alone.
377 his ship sunk, his crew dead, to the last man, and his nation
378 despising him as a traitor.
379  
380  I guess you know already," The radios aboard the ship 
381 transmied the words to the Soviet. Seth held out the Russian
382 to Norwegian translation book, and the paper with the chronicle
383 of the spy's actions.
384  
385 Furtseva peered at him. "So the traitor did not escape," His
386 anger turned to remorse for his crew, and pity for the end of
387 their lives. "As I had feared? He died like the rest?"
388  
389  No, he died in a deflated life raft, I found it below." Seth 
390 but his arm on the Soviet's shoulder as if to hold him up.
391  Let's get back aboard, we have answered this riddle."
392  
393 The radios sent the words back and forth.  "Do you know, for a
394 coment, I thought you might have said for us to go back home. I
395 cannot do that, you know."
396  
397  Of course you can. There's space for you in my apartment 
398 building. It's in the city of New Orleans, settled by the
399 French. Part of the United States now, you might like it there.
400 it's home now, Russian."
401  
402  Alright, but Seth, my name is Mikhail."

465 Oh great advertismentt-fun!  And those of us out east can't call it locally.  And it would
466 be cheaper to call L.A. than to call short-long distance....
467      But ENOUGH of my complaining...
468 .
469      I am glad to see a LOT of people here.  Some are those who have been here only a
470 short time, and others that have been here for years.  And 1 that seems to have been here
471 in two different forms.  I personally feel that the real PEN NAME will be evident in
472 the writings of the two possibles.  But both of them should realize that using a
473 non-standard symbol as a border is just asking for trouble.  Why take the chance of
474 having computer failure, and having to use a terminal without certain keys?  Not a good
475 iea.
476      Well, I shall be off, by before I part for the next few daz

577 Perhaps, Mr. Eakins, the SYSOP of this system values accuracy in spelling,
578 as well as an avoidance of redundancy. Do you suppose ?
579 
580 Mr. Eakins: The first time, it was removed because the Sysop tried calling your 
581 board and got an answering machine. Since then it has not been touched. However
582 since this board only stores 629 line at a time. You might refrain from posting
583 your 'ad' 2 & 3 times a *day*. Once a *week* would be more than sufficient.
584 Currently it is one here 5 or 6 times, using up well over 1/6 of the available 
585 space.

588  To the SYSOP of this BBS:
589 
590  This is the sysop of the Underground 
591  Crue!, I know my spelling is not so
592  hot, and I understand what you mean
593  about message space on this bbs.
594 
595  I was wandering though, if you knew
596  any other message bulletins that are
597  for the 64 computer or infact for any
598  computer that I could post my new
599  bbs on?
600 
601  Would you please leave me some feedback on this matter?
602 
603  I'll call later tonight.
