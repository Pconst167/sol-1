 55              HIGHER SPEEDS BRING MORE DEATHS:-8/28/89
 56     It's a national struggle of the will and the gas pedal that rages after 
 57 states raised speed limits on certain sections of interstate highway to 65 
 58 mph. Concern about just how fast U.S. residents should drive is increasing 
 59 after preliminary evidence shows more people died in highway accidents as a 
 60 result of the higher speed limit.
 61     More U.S. residents are wearing safety belts than ever before, but more 
 62 aggressive promotion of the belts could push use even higher, a safety group 
 63 said. Traffic Safety Now, reported Sunday that in states requiring use of the 
 64 belts, 51 percent of motorists wear them. In states without laws, about 36 
 65 percent of motorists wear them. Thirty-four states have seat-belt laws. 
 66     With faster speeds come greater numbers of deaths, says the National 
 67 Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency is expected to submit a 
 68 formal report next month but preliminary 1988 figures show a 13 percent 
 69 increase in deaths on rural interstates. NHTSA, like the Bush administration, 
 70 says speed limits are the states' business.
 71     Two years ago, with the "energy crisis" long abated, Congress gave states 
 72 permission to increase limits to 65 mph on rural interstates where surrounding 
 73 population does not exceed 50,000. Within nine months, 38 states exercised the 
 74 option. The result: 32,168 miles of interstate, roughly three-fourths of the 
 75 44,328-mile system, were made eligible for 65 mph.
 76     Working with death reports from the first 38 states adopting the higher 
 77 speed limit, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that 1988 
 78 traffic fatalities on rural highways in those states increased 30 percent 
 79 compared to 1987. "It's a much greater increase in deaths than would have been 
 80 expected if speed limits hadn't been changed," says groups spokesman Brian 
 81 O'Neill.
 82     There is a growing perception that the federal speed limit might be the 
 83 most blatantly abused law since Prohibition. About one in every nine drivers, 
 84 or about 20 million U.S. residents, says they own a radar detector, generating 
 85 gross sales estimated at about $300 million yearly. Connecticut, one of 10 
 86 states still enforcing 55 mph, found 85 percent of motorists were exceeding 
 87 that limit.
 88     In 1984, the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academies 
 89 of Science and Engineering, said states spent about $512 million annually to 
 90 enforce 55 mph on about 35 percent to 40 percent of all moving traffic. Other 
 91 findings: 52,000 to 82,000 fewer injuries a year and about $122 million to 
 92 $240 million less in medical, legal and vehicle repair bills.
 93 MOST CRASHES ARE DRIVER ERRORS:-8/28/89
 94     Nearly 21 million auto-related accidents, resulting in 48,700 deaths and 
 95 1.8 million disabling injuries, occurred in 1987, the National Safety Council 
 96 reports. Most, 67 percent, were caused by driver error. In a recent survey of 
 97 500 motorists commissioned by Valvoline Oie1l Company 33 percent wrongly said a
 98 aflashing red traffic light meant "proceed with caution."
 99     Debate continues to rage after states raised speed limits on certain 
100 sections of interstate highway to 65 mph. But concern about just how fast U.S. 
101 residents should drive is sure to intensify over preliminary evidence that 
102 more people have died in highway accidents as a result of the higher speed 
103 limit.
104     In 1974, in the wake of the Arab oil embargo, Congress imposed a 55 mph 
105 limit nationwide; the standard was made permanent the next year. Two years ago 
106 Congress gave states permission to increase limits to 65 mph on rural 
107 interstates where surrounding population does not exceed 50,000. Within nine 
108 months, 38 states exercised the option; Georgia and Virginia did so just last 
109 year.
110     Two years ago 32,168 miles of interstate, roughly three-fourths of the 
111 44,328-mile system, were made eligible for 65 mph. Later, another 2,200 miles 
112 of similar road in 16 states was added on a trial basis. But faster speeds 
113 brought more deaths, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says. 
114 Preliminary 1988 figures show a 13 percent increase in deaths on rural 
115 interstates.
116     There is a growing perception that the federal speed limit might be the 
117 most blatantly abused law since Prohibition. Connecticut, one of 10 states 
118 still enforcing 55 mph, found earlier this year that 85 percent of motorists 
119 were exceeding that limit. The state could lose federal highway money if that 
120 scofflaw figures holds up through 1989.
121     In Pennsylvania, where 1,184 miles of eligible interstate remain at 55 
122 mph, the Legislature considered going to 65 this spring. The debate bogged 
123 down when somebody suggested banning radar detectors. About one in every nine 
124 drivers, or about 20 million U.S. residents, acknowledges owning a radar 
125 detector, generating gross sales estimated at about $300 million yearly.

130 Old glory,  also know as pancake-head,  was strolling in the forrest one day
131 when he heard the distant call of a paratrouper.  Remembering is grade school
132 training,  he quickly ran to the principal's house only to find the house
133 empty. It seems that the principal had died some years earlier and hadn't left
134 a cent to poor pancake-head.  Feeling hyper depressed,  as he tended to feel
135 after discovering the neglegence of the dead,  he decided that the next best
136 thing to do was to releive himself on the nearest public building.  On this
137 particular day,  his urine was a light pink color presumably from thinking
138 about how stupid the proccess of voting in the united states really is.
139 Pancake-head soon finished off the building,  only to discover that it was
140 schedualed for daily maintanance.  Damn he thought,  now I'll have to go back
141 to grandma's place and drink more glue before I can do this again!
142   all this trouble would have gone unnoticed if it hadn't been for the
143 fact that an extra-terrestrial named skinhead hadn't been looking in on the
144 doings on planet Earth that day.  Well,  skinhead thought,  theses earth people
145 sure are ****ed up.  I'm gonna have to get down to earth and show 'em how we
146 do things on the planet glats.  So he hopped into the one way transmat beam,
147 not realizing that Earth technolegy at that time was only capable of
148 trans-beaming to nearby tourist traps,  and then only if they had a sufficient
149 amount of cash to purchase more stuff than would go back through the transmat
150 beam at one time.
151   Pancake-head was on his way to Grandma's house when his leg broke in the
152 middle of nowhere.  It seemed obvious to pancake-head that trouble was in his'
153  future.  At that instant,  skinhead appeard due to a severe malfuntion in
154 the transmat beam.  The malfunction also caused skinhead to mutate into an
155 orian slave girl (the green kind as seen on star trek!).  well, as you can
156 guess, Pancake-head was overwhelmed with lust.  Skinhead didn't have a chance
157 as pancake-head's body instinctivly lept 20 feet in the air and landed in the
158 correct region of skinhead's body to begin mating procedures. The force of
159 pancake-head's landing knocked skinhead out cold.  after finishing the task,
160 pancake-head lay dead upon skinhead.
161   It was some hours later when skinhead awoke from the concussion,  only to
162 find several large dents in his titanium lined underwear,  and Pancake head
163 lying atop him.  skinhead decided not to try to reform earth has he originally
164 set out to do.  Instead,  realizing the tremendous earning potential an
165 Orian slave girl has in this part of the Galexy,  skinhead married several
166 earth men in succession and killed them by letting them try to mate though
167 his titanium underwear.  This action led to several million dollars being
168 given to skinhead as a result of the wills left by the now deceased and
169 sterile husbands.
170   In short,  skinhead lived happily ever after.

188 > SWOB:
189 >      Hate to tell you this, but multivalued logic systems have been around 
190 > for a long time.
191  
192         I realize this.  Ternary logic problems are indeed fun, but to be 
193         meaningful they require a set of circumstances where three values 
194         may occur.  I do not see truth and falsehood as having a third value,
195         (I don't think anybody does) and that was my point.  Facts are either
196         true or false, never anything else.  In short, I'm not saying that
197        logic cannot be applied to cases where more than two values are 
198         possible, I'm only saying that truth and falsehood is not such
199         a case.
200  
201 > They no more destroy the basis of logic, than using a base
202 > other than 10 destroys the basis of arithmetic. 
203  
204         True.  Unfortunately, multi-valued logic can be appropriate or
205         inappropriate to a given problem.  With varied bases, the answer
206         is still the same, but with varied logic values you make assumptions
207         about the data beforehand.  If the quartic/quintic system of logic
208         presented had come up with the same answers as the binary, I would
209         not have any disagreement with its usage.
210  
211 >      Also "This sentence is false" is not a paradox in *any* logic system!
212 > There's usually a chapter on this sor of thing in any good book on symbolic 
213 > logic. The only way it looks like a paradox is if you confuse the langauge
214 > and the meta-language.
215  
216          I considered this problem when trying to think of an actual
217          impossible situation.  Doesn't the meta-language only come
218          into play with blanket statements about the whole group, such
219          as the proverbial Sicilian who says 'All Sicilians are liars'?
220          'This sentence is false' is a self-referential ("This"), so I
221          figured it was outside the realm of the meta-language.  Forgive
222          me if I was wrong.  My point is only that something cannot be
223          both true and false.

232 As she stood there, trying to decide the best course of action, Friar spoke:

291                        DEBATE - CHILD CARE  USA TODAY'S OPINION:
292     No mother, no father should have to pass up a good job because there's no 
293 one to care for their children. No child should be left alone before or after 
294 school. No parent should have to worry all day about the safety of the child 
295 dropped off for care on the way to work. Solving the problem won't be cheap. 
296 But child care is one of the best investments we can make.
297  OTHER VIEWS:
298     TOTTIE ELLIS, vice president of the Eagle Forum and a free-lance writer: 
299 Children belong to their parents and not to the government. Parents should 
300 delay their wants, realizing a child is more valuable than cars, TVs or other 
301 material objects.
302     JEFF RIGGENBACH, free-lance writer and broadcaster: We should not ask 
303 government to "do something." ... We should demand that it undo what it has 
304 done in the past. If our elected officials really want to help us out of the 
305 current child-care crisis, they should begin by backing off.
306     PRESIDENT BUSH: "We must put our trust in parents, not in expanded 
307 bureaucracies."
308     SEN. ORRIN G. HATCH, R-Utah: "I started looking at the statistics and the 
309 facts, and when you do, you ask `What are we doing to our families?' You've 
310 got to be concerned about the parents who just don't know what to do."
311     NATIONAL GOVERNORS' ASSOCIATION TASK FORCE ON CHILDREN: "The federal 
312 government can lead best by example, beginning by developing a coherent 
313 national strategy to support families and their children."
314     OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLA., Robert H. Alexander Jr., 38, lawyer: "The best day 
315 care is not one type, but a range of options that best suits each family. That 
316 could mean government-sponsored day care or private-sector day care."
317     VISALIA, CALIF., Norma Kemper, 63, retired teacher: "I think the old-
318 fashioned way of staying at home is the best kind, if families can afford it. 
319 If not, then day-care centers that are well-staffed, at good facilities and 
320 affordable are fine. I'm not so sure the government should get involved in day 
321 care. It gets into so much and then things go haywire."
322     ARLINGTON, VA., Sam Marsh, 34, outreach coordinator: "The best day care 
323 would be the mother taking care of her own child. But that's not feasible in 
324 every situation. The government should help in some way. I like President 
325 Bush's proposal for a tax credit to offset the cost for day care. Maybe that's 
326 not the best we can do right now, but at least it's a start."
327 DAUGHTER'S RAPE JAILS MOM:-8/30/89
328     A Detroit mother of four was sent to prison for life Tuesday for letting 
329 her 13-year-old daughter be raped as payment for crack cocaine. Susan Barbier, 
330 29, sobbed as Judge James Rashid said she had "sunk to an intolerable level of 
331 humanity." The girl was too shaken to make a statement asking the judge to 
332 keep her mom locked up to protect her siblings, said her father, Michael Dare.
333

338 SWOB:
339      Sorry, but True and False are the endpoints of a continum. I doubt it
340 is possible to make a True statement about the real world, except possibly 
341 mathematically.
342      Remember, "What is Truth?" goes back a long way.
343      As for the metalanguage, it *has* to come in in any "self-referential"
344 sentence. The sentence is just symbols, parsed according to the rules of the 
345 language. If the language is self-consistent, then the sentence has a truth 
346 value. But that value doesn't depend on the *meaning* of the sysmbols.
347      <this sentence> <is> <false>. 
348      <x> <is> <y>.
349      <this sentence> is a symbol. <false> is a symbol.
350      <This sentence> is not The Sentence In Question. <false> is not False,
351 which is a possible result of parsing The Sentence In Question.
352      A good example is the BASIC statement:  A=A+1. By the rules of mathematics
353 this would be a false statement. By the rules of BASIC it results in the value
354 of A changing. The "this sentence is false" paradox is equivalent to looking
355 at the BASIC statement and declaring it a paradox! 
356 	"This sentence is false" is either a nonsenical bit of English, or it 
357 is a collection of symbols to be logically evaluated. In the first case, it
358 isn't anything but nonsense. In the second case, it is just symbols, and self-
359 reference isn't allowed.
360   
361      BTW, if you want examples of "multi-value logic" in the real world, ask a
362 scientist about "degrees of confidence". You have a range from False to true 
363 with stops along the way at various degrees of "probably true" and "probably
364 false". Note the difference between *facts* (ie reality) and *statements about
365 those facts*. Facts are either true or false. Statements about reality have
366 degrees of truth. Note also that a "fact" is a wondrously complex thing.
367 "Water boils at 100 degrees C" is not a fact. "Pure H2O boils at 100 degrees
368 C at standard atmospheric pressure" is a lot closer to being a fact, but 
369 there are still loopholes that have to be closed. ("pure" and "boils" both need
370 some work.."

380          STRANGE JUSTICE IN CHARLOTTE : THE LORD REALLY DOES WORK IN 
381  
382                               MYSTERIOUS WAYS
383  
384                                By ThingFish
385  
386  
387            It's been quite an uplifting week in the news. The twin 
388          spectacle of Leona Helmsley and Jim Bakker being whipped like 
389          dogs and ground into sausage before our video eyes is the best 
390          thing to come over CNN since Lloyd Bentson made Danny Quayle's 
391          lower lip quiver. 
392  
393            The wretched saga of Jism Jim and Pancake Tammy, in 
394          particular, has reached an all new level of hellish grief and 
395          humiliation; or joyous rapture, depending on which side of the 
396          drama you're on. 
397  
398            Bakker is up on some very heavy fraud and conspiracy charges -
399          24 counts in all - which could, in theory, net him 120 years in 
400          prison and a 5 million dollar fine. The PTL "Partners" would 
401          need to dig deep, yet again, to pay off a ticket like that - and 
402          their numbers, and contributions, have been dwindling of late. 
403          It's beginning to look like God Almighty may be sympathetic to 
404          the D.A.'s point of view on this one. 
405  
406            On the third day of the trial in Charlotte, North Carolina,
407          former PTL vice-president Steve Nelson collapsed on the witness 
408          stand - effectively bringing the proceedings to a halt while 
409          urgent prayers from Bakker and an ambulance were summoned. 
410          Somewhere around this time Jim Bakker began feeling a little 
411          light in his loafers himself. 
412          
413               Day four never got off the ground at all. U.S. District 
414          Judge Robert Potter suspended the trial, sent the jury home and 
415          had Bakker committed for psychiatric testing amid baffling 
416          reports that Bakker was found trying to stuff his head under a 
417          couch in order to better escape the scary monsters he was busily 
418          hallucinating. Bakker could be institutionalized for up to 60 
419          days, and he began his journey to the nuthouse by assuming the 
420          fetal position in the backseat of a federal automobile. The U.S. 
421          marshals were not amused. 
422  
423            Some feel that this is all a ruse, a sham cooked up by Jim and 
424          Tammy to take the heat off for a while so they can re-group. But 
425          Bakker was led away IN HANDCUFFS and is now spending his days 
426          and nights in a FEDERAL CORRECTIONS FACILITY. If this freak show 
427          is all just calculated showboating, it can't be working out the 
428          way the Bakkers had hoped. Surely a nice limo ride to a nice 
429          private hospital would have been more what they had in mind. 
430  
431            Tammy Faye was quick to point out that they have been under a 
432          lot of stress lately. Well, maybe so. There are a lot of people 
433          up on charges in this country, but you don't often find them 
434          cowering under the furniture, dodging giant flying manta rays 
435          that are trying to bite their heads off. When a man in a suit 
436          hits the deck to hide from something no one else can see, there 
437          is usually something stonger than stress involved. Maybe Jim has 
438          been dipping into the same diet pills that led Tammy to observe 
439          in-flight monkeys frolicking on the wing of their Lear jet a few 
440          years back. Perhaps these witness stand fainting spells and 
441          early morning lapses into psychosis are a warning sign that the 
442          all-night, hysteria fueled prayer/testimony rehearsal sessions 
443          have reached a dangerously fevered pitch in the Bakker camp. 
444  
445            Another possibility is that what we are witnessing is a kind 
446          of Divine Justice in action, and never mind any courts of law, 
447          legal posturing, or sentencing guidelines. If Jim Bakker has 
448          soiled the carpet of decent society, maybe this is God's way of 
449          rubbing his nose in the steaming mess. And if Jim Bakker is a 
450          bad doggie, you must admit that the Lord has a mighty good arm 
451          with that rolled up newspaper. 
452  
453            Rather than smite him down with a thunderbolt from heaven, 
454          maybe it is God's will that Jim Bakker writhe in secular agony, 
455          that he be left twisting in the wind, fighting off the demons of 
456          his tortured soul, with only his frightening wife, his failed 
457          empire, his financial ruin, and his uncertain future to comfort 
458          him. 
459

461                   Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord

480                 YEAH THINGFISH !! Halleluiah !!BAKKER COMMITTED FOR TESTING:-9/
481     The tumultuous trial of Jim Bakker takes an extended, unscheduled Labor 
482 Day break this week - with the disgraced televangelist committed to a 
483 psychiatric facility. Bakker, charged with fraud and conspiracy, has been 
484 hallucinating and hiding in his lawyer's office in the fetal position, a 
485 defense psychiatrist told the Charlotte, N.C., federal court Thursday.
486     Bakker, reportedly, now has free run of the grounds at a federal prison.  
487 Inmates have been warned by officials to watch their wallets closely.    
488                                                                               
489 LEE ATWATER, head of the National Republican Committee, had this comment:  "I
490 think Jim Bakker should receive a full pardon for all the things he didn't do
491 wrong.  After all, he was behaving in the manner we promote for all good
492 Republicans to behave.  We are just sorry we weren't able to involve him with
493 all the good Lord's bounty we other Republicans received from HUD.  I feel  
494 that if we had a few more Jim Bakkers in this world, we could achive a 
495 Republican majority in the House of Representatives again in our life time."
496                                                                               
497                NEW IDEA FOR FIGHTING DRUGS:-9/1/89
498     An Idaho doctor has come up with a novel idea for combating drug use in 
499 sports: pool the team's urine samples after competition. Dr. Fritz R. Dixon of 
500 Boise suggested in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association that 
501 if the group sample was found to contain drugs, the team would lose the 
502 competition, forcing teams - not individuals - to accept responsibility for 
503 fighting drugs.
504                            sounds like a good idea to me                     
505                                                                              
506 consider this next one in light of the press reports of this country's first
507 involvement in Viet Nam  ... Want to start a war to revive the economy?  Send
508 the advisers first, then we'll need to support them with fighting soldiers, 
509 then we'll need to send material......                                      
510                TRAINERS ARRIVE IN COLOMBIA:-9/1/89
511     U.S. military trainers and equipment begin arriving in Colombia Thursday - 
512 the first big U.S. role in that country's war against the cocaine kings. The 
513 Pentagon said Thursday that up to 100 U.S. military personnel would train 
514 Colombian police to use helicopters, small attack planes, weapons and C-130 
515 cargo planes.
516 Of course, LEE ATWATER had a comment:   "We did our damnest to get a war going
517 in Central America during the Reagan years, but the Contras were more intereste
518 in selling drugs than fighting, so we were forced to give up.  Now, the America
519 people are realizing that our "War on Drugs" is a sham, and we have to appear
520 to do something about it.  Now, we can use that as an excuse for putting 
521 young American lives on the line, send more money south, and look like we're 
522 doing something.  I feel that far-sighted thinking like this will all but 
523 ensure a Republican majority in the House in our lifetime."               
524                                                                                
525                OIL FIRMS FIGHT METHANOL:-9/1/89
526     Faced with the growing momentum of the clean-air movement, big oil 
527 companies are scrambling to head off drastic proposals that would replace 
528 gasoline with alcohol fuels, such as methanol, the Sept. 4 issue of Business 
529 Week reports. 
530     Major oil companies are racing to develop "reformulated" gasolines so they 
531 can compete with alternative fuels, and protect their $100 billion-a-year U.S. 
532 gasoline market from methanol competition, says the Sept. 4 Business Week. 
533 "They don't want to have methanol crammed down their throats," says John R. 
534 Dosher, managing director at Pace Consultants Inc.
535     Top Bush administration officials favor methanol as a new fuel because it 
536 produces 50 percent less smog or ozone than gasoline, the Sept. 4 Business 
537 Week reports. By 1997, 30 percent of all new cars sold in the nine dirtiest 
538 cities in the United States will have to burn cleaner fuels, such as methanol, 
539 under the administration's proposed revisions to the Clean Air Act.
540     Oil companies are hot for reformulated gasoline because they can produce 
541 it in existing refineries, says the Sept. 4 issue of Business Week. But 
542 gasoline can't match methanol as a smog-reducer. Removing lead from gasoline 
543 results in fuels that produce more smog. Refiners have substituted aromatic 
544 compounds that include carcinogens, such as benzene and other smog-producing 
545 chemicals.
546     Arco is working on a reformulated gasoline that reduces evaporative 
547 emissions by 21 percent, yet lowers unburned hydrocarbons - the main culprits 
548 in smog - by only 4 percent. Arco says future gains will be tougher, according 
549 to the Sept. 4 Business Week. It would cost $17 billion to cut aromatics just 
550 10 percentage points, says Information Resources Inc.
551     Refiners claim they can perfect a better gasoline within five years, but 
552 they might not have that much time, says the Sept. 4 Business Week. Despite 
553 oil industry opposition, Colorado passed new clean-air laws two years ago. 
554 Also, California wants 40 percent of all new cars to burn methanol by 2000, 
555 and eight Northeastern states are studying stringent clean-air proposals.
556     LEE ATWATER could not be reached for comment.                             
557                                                                                
558                   7TH WITNESS IMPLICATES ROSE:-9/1/89
559     A seventh witness in the trial of Thomas P. Gioiosa has offered testimony 
560 implicating Cincinnati Reds' manager Pete Rose in tax fraud. Shirley 
561 Fehrenbach, whose daughter dated Gioiosa for a year, said that Gioiosa had 
562 bragged he was sheltering Rose's track winnings from taxes.
563     As Lee Atwater, Chairman of the Republican National committee, said:  "Only
564 little people pay taxes.  I don't understand what everyone's upset about Pete
565 Rose, Leona Helmsly, and and Jim Bakker not paying taxes...it's common practice
566 for us big people.  If they had to pay taxes on the actual amount of money they
567 get, it will leave that much less for them to buy Republican candidates.  If 
568 they don't buy Republican candidates and the elections, we'll never get a 
569 Republican majority in the House again, and we may lose control of the 
570 Presidency and Senate too.  If the wealthy in this country have to follow the
571 same rules and laws the middle and lower classes do, what's the point of being
572 ludicrusly wealthy?"                                or words to that effect. 
573

578                          A TRUE STORY IN THE DAY IN THE
579                            LIFE OF A "COP-WANNA-BE"
580  
581  
582           A short story though looking back it made me feel better about my job
583 as a security officer with Crowd Management Services (CMS). We do mostly 
584 concerts and events like that. The other night I was working the George Clinton
585 concert at Stary Night. All night I'd been checking coats at the door for guns,
586 booze, cameras, etc. I also had to tell people they couldn't leave and come 
587 back, Stary Night has a 'No re-entry' policy. After 6 hours of doing this the 
588 concert was over and people started leaving. A young lady came up to me and 
589 asked about paging her friend because she'd lost her. My partner went up to the
590 main floor and looked around for her. No luck. I walked her around for 20 
591 minutes, through parking lots and small crowds looking for her friend. No luck.
592 She was from Seattle, lost, scared, and a little drunk. She was nearing tears &
593 her friend was nowhere to be found. It was also time for me to stow my gear and
594 get home. Well, it was my job to protect her, a paying customer of the concert,
595 and to make sure things were 'cool'. At one point she nearly broke out in tears
596@

598 her and said "It's going to be all right. I'll stow my gear, we'll get you to a
599 phone and you can call a friend of yours. I won't leave you alone until you get
600 to your friend." She settled down and I walked her back to the hall. I checked 
601 in my shirt and got my stuff and went to get her a phone. Lo and behold her 
602 friend was there. They hugged and talked to her for a bit and I walked out with
603 a pat on her shoulder and said "Don't lose your friends, it'll be all right 
604 now." I caught a cab and came home. 
605      Thinking about it, I remembered holding her in my arms and telling her 
606 that everything would be all right. Yeah, it's a rough job, but at times 's 
607 really worth the effort.

779 > SWOB:
780 >      Sorry, but True and False are the endpoints of a continuum.
781  
782         I'm still not convinced we've actually disagreed on much yet.
783         If you mean by this that we always make statements with less
784         than perfect certainty, I wholeheartedly agree.  If you mean
785         that some statements can be true in some cases, and not in
786         others, I also agree.  But if you are saying that a statement
787         about a particular thing can be somewhere between true and
788         false, I'm beginning to doubt.  Now surely something can be
789         "close" to the truth, as the models of modern Physics closely
790         parallel the actual observations, and if you were to call
791         modern physical models "near truth," I would tend to agree.
792         The only place I would depart from this statement is where
793         one is talking about something in the specific, well-defined,
794         and complete sense.  A statement must, in the end, be either
795         right-on or not.  This is the sense of truth I was referring
796         to when I said that things are either true or not.
797  
798 > I doubt it
799 > is possible to make a True statement about the real world, except possibly 
800 > mathematically.
801  
802         With infinite precision?  probably not.  But if you widen your scope
803         enough, you'll eventually hit something that's true (i.e. instead of
804         saying "water boils at 100C", say something like "water boils" 
805         (I know, I know, 'how profound!'))
806  
807 >      Remember, "What is Truth?" goes back a long way.
808  
809         At least back to Francis Bacon.  But, as William Golding said, some
810         use it as the end of an argument, instead of the beginning.
811

820 > which is a possible result of parsing The Sentence In Question.
821  
822         I think I see what you mean: that the statement is not self-
823         referential.  But I can find no justification for this position.
824         To say that "this sentence" is on a different level of abstraction
825         than "false" does not ring true to me.  They are both particulars
826         and both concrete.  And I cannot agree with the statement that the
827         value of a sentence does not depend on the meaning of its symbols.
828         The sentence "I am human" can be true if and only if "I" (the
829         person, not the word or the concept) truly "am" (in the physical
830         sense) "human" (fall within whatever specifications determine
831         humanity).
832                 The sentence "All sentences are false" is not nonsense, 
833         because "all sentences" is a different level of abstraction than
834         the sentence in question.  "Never say never" is not a paradox
835         since the first "never" is talking about all statements, the 
836         second about particular ones (see Neil Portman, "Confusing Levels
837         of Abstraction").  I do not see this type of difference in "This
838         sentence is false."
839  
840 > A good example is the BASIC statement:  A=A+1. By the rules of mathematics

844  
845         Of course, if you change what "is" means, you can make the sentence
846         coherent.  (In the preceding example, you have simply changed the
847         meaning of '=' from comparison to assignment)
848  
849 > "This sentence is false" is either a nonsenical bit of English,
850  
851         Exactly my point.  The sentence is pure nonsense.
852  
853 > or it 
854 > is a collection of symbols to be logically evaluated.
855  
856         I suppose you can view it that way, but then you are taking away
857         its meaningfulness to the real world anyway.
858  
859 > In the first case, it
860 > isn't anything but nonsense. In the second case, it is just symbols, and self
861 >rerence isn't allowed.
862  
863         Exactly!  So what are we disagreeing on?  I think, perhaps, I was 
864         speaking solely in the first sense, while you were speaking solely
865         in the second.  
866  
867 > Note the difference between *facts* (ie reality) and *statements about
868 > those facts*.                        ^^^^^^^^^^
869  
870         In keeping with the context of the discussion, I was restricting
871         my discussion to the truth or falsity of facts only.  I agree 
872         completely that statements about facts can be "true" (accurate)
873         without being infinitely precise.
874  
875 > Facts are either true or false.
876  
877         Couldn't have said it better myself.
878  
879 > Statements about reality have
880 >degrees of truth.
881  
882         Yes, depending on how closely they approximate the facts.
883  
884         Well, I can't really see much that I disagree with other than the
885         nature of the statement 'This sentence is false.' (whether it is
886         self-referential or refers to something else).  I am content to
887         say that it is an assertion which can be assigned no logical value,
888         and is therefore not a proposition, but if it really is referring
889         (somehow) to the *concept* of a sentence rather than this particular
890         sentence, please explain how this is reconciled with other sentences
891         about particular things.
892                 In short, I don't know what the sentence is.  It seems to 
893         me to be nonsense, and since the application of levels of abstraction
894         and meta-language to self-referential truth statements is not a
895         burning question in my mind, I'm willing to drop it.  We seem to
896         agree on the point I was making to (Friar, was it?) that facts are
897         either true or false.

909  
910 But what both Friar and I have been saying is that *statements* may be true,
911 false, or anything inbetween. Your exapmple above will do quite well:
912 "water boils". The statement may be true or it may be false. But it requires 
913 information not present in the statement OR IN THE RULES OF DISCOURSE to 
914 determine which. That Is why I said it is almost impossible to make a true 
915 statement about reality.
916 The statement must be able to stand on it's own. 
917 Likewise, "This sentence is false" can't be a paradox, because the only means
918 of parsing it that will even give it the appearance of one is English. English 
919 is not a "formal system". Thuis it can't have paradoxes...
