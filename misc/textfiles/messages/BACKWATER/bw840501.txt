30     Sitting at a table near the window, I sit eating a sandwich.
31 (for some odd reason reality hopping makes me hungry) The comfort of
32 the inn surrounds me. The sturdy old furniture, a fire in the hearth,
33 and the buzz of conversation from the few patrons filtering in for the
34 evening. Must of my party has already arrived I note when the Alchemist
35 comes through the door. Looking outside I see a lone figure stop at the
36 rowan tree and turn to walk away from the inn and fade into the rising
37 mist and failing light. Filled with a sense of need and curiosity I
38 toss a coin to the innkeeper and leave the warm comfort.
39    As I follow the shape in the mist ahead I turn up my collar to 
40 delay the chill...

67  
68      I arrive without grace as, having misjudged my exact arrival position
69 due to my haste in preparing the ritual of transferrance, I drop to the
70 ground from a little less than three feet.  My embarrassment is quickly
71 turned to dissapointment though, as I see that I am alone at the Henge and
72 I sense that I have missed the party of travelers.  My friends have already
73 made the crossing!  And here I stand, alone upon the avenue between the
74 heel stone and the slaughter stone.
75  
76      This is not the point that I had chosen for my arrival at all, and I
77 feel a dawning realization that where I have landed was not mere chance.
78 There seems to be great power here, and one that I have no desire to meet.
79 Moving quickly I run through the outer Aubrey holes, well to the northwest
80 side of the slaughter stone, heading toward the Sarcen circle.  What little
81 strength I derive from this Henge is found at the Alter stone within the
82 Trilithons, not from the necromantic power of the slaughter stone.
83  
84      Within the Sarcen circle, I can feel safe for the moment, and I feel
85 the rage of whatever it was that lay in wait for me.  It screams its anger
86 into my mind, and I reel from the force of its hate.  I could perform a
87 ritual that would reveal the identity of this persecuter but I don't know
88 how well protected I am within this new Henge, so instead I quickly cast
89 the invocation of the Ishtar gate (inappropriate for the situation, but the
90 easiest of the invocations for me) and I...                                     
91 arrive home.  Safely within the confines of my own walls, my body decides
92 that it is time to release the nervous energy it had developed during my
93 encounter, and I sit down shaking.
94  
95      It is many minutes before I have regained enough self-posession to
96 shakily pour a glass of brandy.  I now know whose presence it was, for I
97 have felt His frigid touch before, and shrank from his cold embrace.  He is
98 the elder of the De Danann, great Mider of old, and He lay in wait not only
99 for me, but for any who would profain this new Henge by using the slaughter
100 stone.  I was safer than I thought, as such magics are not my choice, and
101 His hate was frustration at the knowlege of my safety.  It would seem that
102 the only danger I face is from this plane, from one who would use my name
103 for his own purposes.  Even this is no danger though, since my friends know
104 the nature of my entry.  Never would I answer a request with insults or
105 haughty words, though my answer might not be what was desired by they who
106 ask.
107  
108      Hearing a knock at the door, I am once again filled with apprehension.
109 Could it be Mider, come to steal me away?  But quickly my sense returns,
110 knowing this is not His way, for one such as He never knocks.  I approach
111 the door, grasp the worn knob, and draw it open.

119 walk alone in the night. For there is no one true God. Only good and evil. And the

174 The silence seemed to last for days, yet I knew it was not so. My 
175 relief at finding solid ground after such a long time of being 
176 adrift and my weakness from lack of adequate sustenance for such 
177 a long time causes my mind to become distorted and lost in the 
178 past times. The pathes ripple and twine until I no longer know 
179 what is real and what is imaginary. For all I know, this very 
180 ground upon which I sit is but a fever driven delirium. Yet I 
181 hope and pray that it is not so. It has been far too long and I 
182 could not bear to wake only to find myself still adrift at the 
183 mercy of the fickle tides and pounding waves. I stare out over 
184 the fence and the rock wall beyond to the cloud filled sky and 
185 the coming squal with its trailing tendrils of water. Will it 
186 engulf me in its fury, or will I gain shelter here at last? Even 
187 as I watch, my raft upon which I had survived for so long is 
188 lifted by the waves and dashed to the rocks destroying what is 
189 left of my past, leaving me no place left to go. Watching the 
190 tatered remains of my craft being destroyed, I did not hear the 
191 door behind me slowly creak open. Only when PAM cleared her 
192 throat did my senses return to the present. Half startled, I turn 
193 to see PAM sticking her head out with a quizical look. "And what 
194 might you want?" she asked. Momentarily my voice failed me, for 
195 this was the first person I had seen in other then my dreams in a 
196 very long time. When finally my mind was able to form the words, 
197 my voice failed me. Trying to get up, I find that my legs fail 
198 me. Reaching up I grab hold of the porch roof support and using 
199 this I pull myself up. Holding on to the post, for my legs will 
200 not hold me of thier own, I again try to speak. With effort I 
201 forced the words out, though my voice cracked from long disuse. 
202 "Fair mistress, I ask for shelter. You have every right to 
203 refuse, I have nought to offer in payment for this, for I am but 
204 a shipwrecked soul set adrift upon your shore. All I have that I
205 can offer in return is my friendship, though I guaranty it to be 
206 true."

209 Milchar looks about again, and what he thought he saw was so; the reality around
210 him was deteriorating and he began to slip through.  He hastity drew back his
211 robes and exposed the Amulet of Zelgar, one of the three left in all the 
212 realities.  Its power seemed to jell and strike out at the fabric of space, and
213 it won the temporary battle.  For now.  'I must tell the others of this reality
214 of this', he thinks, 'or this world may end rather soon due to the Unravel ling
215 Effect.  This place seems to be a wedge of some higher being who wishes it to
216 cease existing'.  He chants the necessary spell as the Amulet thrusts forth 
217 a narrow beam of emerald light, which quickly widens to a vertical line of 
218 six feet in height.  Continuing his chanting, Milchar passes his hands before
219 the line, which widens horizontally into a Portal.  Hoping that he remembered
220 the co-ordinates, he stepped through.

271 After all isn't this a bullitin board?
272 Why not use some of that intellect and tell us about some neat things in life
273 you have discovered lately or how you alomst had a close one.
274 I mean no offense to Pam, but enough is enough. Oh by the way Pam, can you tell
275 me which gate within the 7 is the most dangerous to pass through?

385      This is the book of Entrance to the Seven Zones above the Earth, which Zones were known to the Chaldeans, and 
386 to the ancient races that preceded them among the lost temples of UR. know that these Zones are governed by the cele-
387 stial spirits, and that passage may be had by the Priest through those lands that border on the Unzoned Wastes beyond
388  
389 Know that when Walking thus through the Sea of Spheres, he shouled leave his
390 body and his property, lest he be slain unawares and must wander througnhout
391 eternity amomg the dark spaces between the stars, or else be devoured by the wrathful IGIGI that dwell beyond.
392 
393     Know that thomust Walk the Steps of the Ladder of Lights, each in its place and one at a time, and that thou 
394 must enter by the Gates in the lawful manner, as is put down in the Covenant; else, thou art surely lost.
395 
396     Know that thou must keep purified for the space of one moon for the Entrance to the first step, one moon between
397 the first and the second step, and again between thde second and the third, and so on in like manner.  Thou must 
398 abstain from spilling they seed in any manner for like period of time, but thou mayest worship at the temple of 
399 ISHTAR, provided thou lose not thine Essence.  And this is a great secret.
400 
401     Thou must needs call upon thy God in the dawn light and upon thy Goddess in the light og dusk, every day of the
402 moon of purification. Thou must summon thy watcher and instruct it perfectly in its duties, providing it with a time
403 and a place whereby it may serve thee and surround thee with a flaming sword, in every direction.

407 Dwell on that for today, and I will add part II later.
408 Have a nice sunday today and keep on talking..
409 Oh by the way, 6 more days until SYSTEM SMASH begins its debut.

415 I thought that EVERYONE knew that simplistic drivel... why not inform them 
416 of the Ruby Valley?  If you will not, I will.
417 The Ruby Valley is a semi-mystical place, being neither wholly in fantasy nor
418 totally in reality, and is the only place wher a reality traveller may see, in
419 one instant, a complete map of all the realities and all the connections thereto
420 .  Once every 173 years (this reality time), a shaft of golden light permeates
421 this place, causing the many rubies by which this place is named to shine, 
422 sparkle, and throw off rays of light, which form the map.  Some say that the 
423 rubies change position as the multiverse does, but others state it is the other
424 way around.  Entrance there is not easy, for many spells must be cast in 
425 succesion without rest, totalling 20 days of casting.  If an error is made, the
426 whole process must start again.
427 (The spells required are listed in the 23rd to the 41st pages of the Tome of 
428 Zagig, and you may find them there.)

433 How the reality portals ever free up is a mystery beyond the scope of this
434 class! What happened to the grand adventure of the past three weeks? Has it
435 been all for naught? Whilst PAM was the object for the journey, we all
436 arrive, and find she is on some island in some uncharted sea (perchance
437 earth-sea) and not with her friends at the Inn. Oh Innkeeper what is the
438 purpose? Can you take a position of leadership? Throw down your apron! Stop
439 cleaning those glasses! We are in dire need of aid! Our original party has
440 been spread accross the dust of the cosmos. Is anyone out there? MIG, TMA,
441 The Traveller, Fast Fred, Voyeur, apprentic, Bard, alchemist, milchar,
442 poet...anyone??? We must band together to strike down this latest invasion
443 of interlopers!

447 What is this? What am I doing here? Where am I? What is this
448 place? This doesn't look like New Hampshire! What is going on?
449 How could this have happened? I must have made a mistake some
450 where in my calculations. Was it the trans-luscent reverb
451 factor? Or perhaps the binomial nomenclature of the pre-
452 ordained taylor series bit plane molecule of kinetic energy?
453 No matter. I am here, and I better make the best of it until
454 I can find a way to get back to the lab, and Al.
455 Is that a building I see in the distance? Intelligent life
456 after all. Maybe I am in New Jersy. Better head that way and
457 see what I can find.

462 the controller looked over the vast panorama of energy transfers arcing
463 back and forth.  Soon, his time would come as the vast inteller transport
464 ships would strike into the delicate lattice of energy beams placed so as to
465 provide maximum cushioning aginst the residual effects of hyper-energy-
466 transferring.  He felt his pulse quicken as it always did.  This time, 
467 however, there would be a new and different element involved.  The next 
468 transport that would arrive would be carring no less than the president of 
469 the 6th quadrant, Wlfrt deston.  Considered one of the most clever and canny
470 of the council politicians, he was returning from a summet meeting from the 
471 Andromeda cluster.  The controller thought once again of the sequence that
472 he would go through.  If he was successful, he would end the life and career
473 of one of the most hated despots in the galaxy. The moment grew closer.....

498 L'homme:Then let us begin!  First we must know exactly WHO we're fighting.
499 Next, dispose of them in the most efficient and humane way possible. (A 
500 Fireball, mayhap?)  Do you know of any way to close the rift in this reality so
501 that unwanted sorts cannot easily travel here?  I think the Ruby Valley would 
502 help us immensely, but we do not have the time for such a journey.  Hmmm...
503 If only I could move my tower to this reality.  Perhaps I could, but the energy
504 required is not available unless you have another source I am not aware of.
505 In my tower, there are secrets I have not delved into yet, for they are many,
506 and I am just one.  I do know there is a room within that can show you the way
507 to any reality, if you answer oone question it asks.  Not easy, by any means.
508 I will wait for the others to answer my mind-plea, for I think that they will
509 have some solutions to these and other
510 problems.  I still have not found any Kyros wine hereabouts....

615      It has been so long since I've cleaned a table here in the Inn!  And
616 things have changed so much!  I need to take great care, for once I've fin-
617 ished with a portion of the table, I can't go back to it.
618 
619      I'm certainly glad that my good friend the Innkeeper continues to run
620 this establishment, despite the problems he has had of late with rowdy and
621 obnoxious patrons.  From what I've heard, some have even attempted to van-
622 dalize it, which is the source of the new rules regarding returning to a
623 table once you've left it.  It means more work for him cleaning up, but less
624 than it would require to replace the furniture once it is destroyed.  Ah, if
625 only all the patrons could behave as well as they once did.....
626 
627      Finally!  This table is nearly done, and a new one will soon be ready.
