24    On a table near the back, the piper was peeling shavings off a reed.
25 From time to time he would blow into the reed and listen critically to
26 
27 the cawing that ensued, then pass the razor-sharp edge of his skean dubh
28 down one side or the other.  Noticing that the sounds of debate had 
29 faded away, and the sounds of the storytelling had not yet picked up, 
30 he sighed.  The ebb and flow of time at the inn imposed its own rythms
31 on the patrons -- debates surged and died, stories went charging off
32 with great abandon then disintegrated into myriad conflicts.  Placing
33 the freshly trimmed reed in the chanter, the piper shouldered and winded
34 his pipes.  With a slightly pensive air, he played "the Nut-Brown Maiden."

60 Laz.-Fai.: No, I haven't had the pleasure of reading it. I don't even have
61    a motorcycle! It's also not clear from your cryptic comment exactly which
62    direction you are facing, and what you might be seeing. A Zen Master was
63    once asked, if the essence of Zen is the Three Pillars, why are so many
64    books written about it? His answer was that they are written for money.
65 Cistop Mikey: I sure agree that communications is the key to better
66    understanding between people. The idea of direct satellite transmission
67    as a vehicle for increased global understanding is an intriguing one. One
68    of the tricky parts is going to be the removal of the first order filters,
69    such as the ones that now are used to structure the network news. One of
70    the great joys of the 'backwater' is being able to read the ideas people
71    choose to express, without filtering and interpretation. Bravo!, for a
72    policy that offer the possibility of *real* communication between people.
73 No doubt, when the history books are written about this era, the computer,
74 and the ability to communicate-at-a-distance, will go down as two of the
75 most dramatic factors. They have introduced a vast potential for change.
76 With any great potential, there is the possibility of using it in a way that
77 is creative or a way that is destructive. The fact that you are reading this
78 puts you right in the middle of this process. Whether your influence is
79 large or small it does count. The rules are still very loose, but major
80 course directions are already beginning to appear. Computers can be viewed
81 as 'mind amplifiers', but what of the nature of the signal being amplified?
82 What of the filters called software? People who create computer software
83 obviously have major influence on the use domain. After all, aren't computer
84 programs 'freeze dried intelligence'? If some programmers knew just how
85 visible their thought are in the code they write, it might give them pause.
86 When you use a program you are obliged to experience the bias, concept,
87 and style of the people who created it. This means that people are going to
88 determine how these things affect our quality of life. Some of them are US!
89 It might be worthwhile to give some thought to which directions we wish to
90 support. The writing of the book of values is now being in progress...

131 Ted,
132         You categorically state that current interest rates are not a function
133 of the market. However, by your incomplete definition that follows your 
134 statement, you partialy describe the very forces that determine the market  
135 and thus the rates. How can that be ?....or simply stated either they are 
136 controled without regard to the market and economic conditions ......or they
137 are taken into account and are a direct result of those factors. 
138         Whats wrong in attracting direct foreign investment ?. 
139 If you think that just because dollars are held overseas they are not
140 an integral part of money supply....I suggest you re-read the definitions of
141 M2 & M3 both have considerable eurodollar componets. As for being taxed at a
142 lower rate...up until July 31st 84 the overseas investor was taxed at a 
143 rate of 30% on any gains. Currently they are taxed on a capital gains basis.
144 Hardly a condition one could call unfair. 
145         You say " These past few months the government has been pushing the 
146 interest rates to artificial lows "...Where have you been ? In the last 10
147 months there have been no less than 4 prime rate movements upward. The Federal
148 Reserve has raised the discount rate at least twice. And bond yields have 
149 steadily gone up...An overall condition that is not indicative of any effort
150 on the part of government to " artifically lower interest rates ".
151         On the issue of Continental, I support the bail out. The precedents 
152 of Chrysler, the Hunts etc. aside. One of the major roles of government
153 is to promote economic stability. To allow a multi-billion dollar institution
154 , the fifth largest bank in our country, a major clearinghouse and
155 correspondent of a multitude of mid-western banks, to falter would be to 
156 encourage economic irresponsibility. The Fed is" the lender of last resort "
157 and does so with great deliberation and reluctance. Their intervention on
158 behalf of Continental was to promote economic stability....not hinder 
159 american business interests. In the final analysis without governmental 
160 participation the greatest losses would of been in the private sector. 
161 And within that context there can be no qualms with "government interference".
162  
163 voyeur,
164         Good...now if we can only get a bloody 5211 to stick around. 
165 ...I had thought that L'homme had without a doubt proved the toxic nature
166 of that vile orange substance....And yet you went ahead and used the liquid
167 ...I have recent information that Sloane Kettering is considering its 
168 use for acute " Diceus Abnormalus "...a common mental aberration effecting
169 players of board games....unfortunatly after the effects wear off the 
170 patient is much worse....

311 To the missguided defender of RAYGUN above.
312 Why don't you open your eyes and mind???You appear to be somewhat inteligent
313 ,at least in your entries (ie: spelling, punctuation etc.) but your attitude
314 in regards to your fellow human beings leaves a lot to be desired. The 
315 poverty level is indeed up, from 9% in '79 to 15% now. Un-employment is also
316 still higher than in '79 in spite of what the RAYGUN administration would
317 like you to believe. Interest rates are a direct result of the Federal 
318 spending not of Wall Street. The federal reserve has kept the lid on somewha
319 in spite of RAYGUN. If it wasn't for Volker we'd probably be at 25% 
320 unemployment and 30% interest on morgtages. Our drugstore cowboy in the 
321 Whitehouse is suffering from incurable
322 "I can do no wrong" syndrome and has not
323 been able to see the country beyond his own limited views
324 
325 A vote for another four years of this fiasco is a vote for nuclear war and
326 a return to the middleages, right wing born-again attitudes. We need to go

339    hearing what you think about such ideas. You sure hit the nail on the

341    being the first in recorded history to place the accomplishments of

372 FIN - You are right, they are having a field day with this.  But I will admit
373       it was a pretty stupid remark.  But every one has the opportunity to
374       stuff his mouth with foot now and then.
375 
376 M.M. - I feel that the concept of arete' as espoused by the sophists that
377        were so violently attacked by Aristotle was most illuminating.
378        That was a major turning point in history and evolution.  Prior
379        to that time most thought was governed by the right hemisphere of 
380        the brain.  Since that time, with the advent of applied reason,
381        most thought has been governed by the left brain.  The left brain
382        is called the 'rational side' of the mind, while the right brain
383        is referred to as the 'feeling' side of the brain.
384        We may have reached a point in human history that will force a 
385        return to pre-Aristotelian thinking.  I do not know if that is true
386        or not, but it seems that something will happen.  Soon.
387        The Christians among us (Deborah comes to mind) do not feel that
388        a nuclear war is possible, and perhaps they are right.  I do not
389        know, being an agnostic.  I am leaning towards Christianity, 
390        however, as it seems a good way to cope with the fear.

392 Others - Reagan has done an admirable job with the economy.  My money 
393          value has stabilized, any one who WANTS to work has a job available
394          to him/her, and a new wave of self and country esteem is 
395          spreading through the nation.  Not a bad bunch of accomplishments.

399 WE ARE ALL AGNOSTICS. SOME OF US ARE HONEST ENOUGH TO ADMIT IT.
400 WE ARE CALLED PRAGMATISTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. OTHERS ARE NOT
401 HONEST ENOUGH TO ADMIT THEIR AGNOSTICISM. THEY ARE CALLED
402 CHRISTIANS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. THEY BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT, HOLY
403 ETC, TO CONVERT OTHERS TO THEIR SYSTEM OF BELIEF BY INSTILLING
404 FEAR IN THEM. FEAR OF SPENDING A VERY LONG TIME IN A VERY HOT
405 PLACE.THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IF YOUNG IMPRESSIONABLE CHILDREN.
406 SOME 'CHRISTIANS', IE OTHER BRANCHES OF RELIGIOUS DOGMA LIKE 
407 MUSLIMS, ISLAMICS,ETC, BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH THEM
408 SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH, AS DID THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. IF
409 SOMEONE SPEAKS OUT AGAINST US, THEN SILENCE THEM. PUT THEM TO
410 DEATH, LEST PEOPLE START TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES. THINK 
411 ABOUT IT. THE 'CHURCHES' HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY TIMES
412 MORE DEATHS,TORTURE,BROKEN FAMILIES, WRECKED LIVES, THAN
413 HITLERS WERMACHT. 
414 TIMES CHANGE. PEOPLE WILL NOT STAND FOR HANGING SUSPECTED
415 HERETICS. (CONFESS THOU ART A WITCH, OR WE WILL HANG THEE. 
416 "AND IF I CONFESS? " "WHY, WE WILL HANG THEE".)
417 PEOPLE HAVE LEARNED TO THINK, INSTEAD OF HAVING THEIR THINKING
418 DONE FOR THEM BY SELF APPOINTED 'SAVIOURS WHO HIDE BEHIND THEIR 
419 PULPUTIC BASTIONS OF HYPOCRICY.

445   As for Reagan sticking a foot in his mouth, it was some more than that, it
446 was a whole shoestore.  I agree that Reagan's stands on economic issues are
447 more likely to keep this country's economy afloot.  But we must realize that
448 good ol' Ronnie might just get us all killed, and then who cares about
449 the economy.  I believe that Reagan is completely out of touch with certain
450 issues, mainly U.S. - U.S.S.R. relations.  Someone who calls Russia " the 
451 evil empire " is definately a threat.  His ideas would not be so bad, 
452 providing that he were in the old actors home in a position of no authority,
453 as opposed to holding the key to nuke the world.  We cannot have someone
454 in office who believes that the Soviet Union must be exterminated, because
455 to attempt this would be signing our own death warrant.  Good ol' Ronnie just
456 lives in a psuedo reality when people get killed, they come to life agin
457 once the filming stops.  He may not directly believe this, but it is my opinion
458 that this idea lurks in the back of his head.
459   The other problem is that Ron is really just to old.  He has lived a great
460 long life, so what does he care if the world is ruined after he departs
461 and goes to heaven.  Of course he does not directly believe this, but again
462 it lurks in the back of his head.  I cannot accept a President that no
463 matter how good his economic policies are, that has brought on the worst
464 relations towards the Soviet Union in quite some time, if not ever.  This
465 is not to say that I like Mondale at all ( I don't ), but while the economy
466 suffers, at least we have better chances of being in existance.  Having
467 a previously wonderful economy in a place that is radioactve wasteland
468 is bullshit ( excuse the language please ).  Being unconfortably dead
469 is not a better state for this country and the world, besides the fact
470 that it doesn't appeal to me.
471   Anyone want to help me with the MBasic problem?
472          I have said enough - Andrew

474 RAINdeer was a slick operation-the land, buildings, farm equipment,and a fleet
475 of white edsels (symbol of pure idiocy according to L'homme) bespoke a large
476 capital base.  It was a great arrangement.  The Rajneeshies were happy to 
477 devote their wealth and energies to Dangerfield and he was happy to take
478 them.  The followers got spiritually fulfilled and dangerfield got rich and
479 powerful.  What a deal.  But I had to envy them.  I sometimes despised my
480 rigorous intellect which prevented the blissful unreasoning surrender of
481 blind faith.
482 "That building's hot," L'homme broke my thoughts.  HOT???
483 Ma Prem had left us to arrange the meeting with the Head Consul. A slender
484 dark-eyed girl walked over to L'homme.  "Terrific camera," she said loudly.
485 Then, softly and quickly, "You are alll in danger. Don't look in that 
486 building.  Don't even try.  You must leave now.  Please..." Her huge eyes
487 widened, "take me with you.  I will find you when it is time."  She turned
488 and was gone.
489 "Gosh," said Josh.
490 Rivers suddenly appeared.  Had she seen?  Her face was a mask of serenity.
491 We hurried to the Head Consul chambers. As we crossed a narrow opening be-
492 tween two buildings, We were engulfed in a pervasive rumbling sound. A
493 huge tractor was almost upon us.  I plastered myself to the wall beside us,
494 but Ma Prem froze facing the enormous machine.  Joshua tackled her and
495 shoved her into a doorway.  The tractor trundled past us and crashed into one
496 of the barns. We scrambled up to the driver, a tall dark man with a thick
497 greying mustache and a ragged hole in his left temple.  Rivers' face was
498 contorted with shock and grief.  "Blackwell," she gasped. "Oh, God - not
499 Blackwell."

502 Andrew : Good god! Do you really believe what you write? I am bewildered
503 that anyone could think thusly. "In the back of his mind"? Get serious!
504 Do you really think that because someone is old they have less of a zest
505 for life?  Do you really believe that the old don't care about the future
506 since they have lived what you call a "long" life? Be rational about it.
507 CYM : "There you go again". As abusive as ever. It never ceases to amaze me
508 how people who utilize technology nearly always return to their primal
509 instincts of attack attack attack, abuse, abuse, abuse when using said
510 technology. Your voice is a heated one. Hot, but devoid of maturity. Can
511 you really be honest about feelings without insulting? Can you deal with
512 others on an equal level? I think not. You have never demonstrated any
513 sign of temerance. Your entries simply remind the rest of us that there
514 are dangerous people out there. People to be avoided. People who must be
515 feared because that little timebomb in their head could go off at any 
516 moment. I hope I am nowhere near you when that huge chip you seem to be
517 carrying around on your shoulder falls off. The damage is unthinkable.
518 Phantom Philosopher : Your anti-religious stand has an interesting tone
519 to it. You too sound like someone who has been hurt be religion sometime
520 in the past, and you are extracting revenge with the pen by overreacting
521 to religious issues. Your convictions are strong, but so to are those who
522 would fight you. You may sing your song of anger loud and strong, but for
523 the most part it will fall on deaf ears. There can be no re-alignment now.
524 It is far too late hundreds of years before you were born.
525 L.F. and M.M. : Of all the discussions I read on here of late, only yours
526 resembles the sputterings of logical man. You contemplate the origins
527 of neo-political thinking, and equate them with the adjustment of thought
528 method. That is an interesting course, abliet incorrect though. Poor
529 ancient Greek philosophers, while possibly basking in the light of your
530 credits, would hardly take true credit for the things you say. As any
531 anthropologist would know, mans adjustment to his environment is not
532 wrought out of sudden change brought on by a single thought, but is changed
533 through the years by continuous social pressures. These pressures come from
534 the need to change in the first place. A vicious circle no? There can be no
535 greater need for change than danger to a life-threatening situation. The
536 change itself, magnified many times by the passing years becomes the new
537 standard, until it too must be modified. The changes you so adeptly pointed
538 out are merely the current response to our environment. Man is on the move.
539 He will not stagnate. It is impossible given the history and conditioning
540 of man. Change is as inevitable as the change in tides. Credit for change
541 must be given to Man himself, not individual men. Men may modify eddys,
542 but Real change was wrought in the hearts and minds of the human creature
543 at creation.
544 I have taken a great deal of time now, but I felt I must respond to the
545 slings and arrows of my fellow user. You may or may not hear more from
546 me, for I have done my stated purpose. If you care to answer my word,
547 then address your replies to Mellow Man.

549 them as I see them. I have been around this world quite a while and I can 
550 probably read the writing on the wall (as well as between the lines) a lot bette
551 than most. I've lived under both Democratic & Republican administrations
552 and been of voting age in the last 9 elections. Never before has the country
553 been in worse shape (financially & moraly) The present occupant of the 
554 presidency is undoubtably the worst we have ever endured. I never thought 
555 I'd say it but where is Nixon now. Even Nixon wasn't so insensitive to the
556 American people '

563 The pity is, all this talk, talk, talk, won't change a THING.
564 
565 As for instantaneous global communication, I see this as a effective step
566 toward univeral tolerance.  To remove myth and fear from people's
567 perceptions of others is to acheive freedom.  How does the Kremlin retain
568 power?  Mostly by force, but partly by guile:  "Those profit hungry imper-
569 ialistic madmen will destroy us!  If we don't ... blah, blah".  No doubt
570 many Russians believe.  And we hear like words from Washington.  The greater
571 reach we have as individuals the greater chance we have to show ourselves
572 as loving and alive.  I believe we will have the opportunity to remove the
573 myths and fears we hold.  That we will do it in my lifetime, however, is
574 doubtful.
