81 Alex: it looks like Leonard, L'homme, myself, and Petrov.  (Plus MiG; it sounds
82 like he's finding his own way over).  Petrov indicated an interest, so I invited
83 him.  If it's a problem, lemme know and I shall tell him some lie or other.
84 L'homme has been making threats about the vile orange liquid again, so perhaps
85 you'd better get the decontamination gear ready.
86 :::::::::::::::::::::::::O O::::::::::voyeur::::::::::O O::::::::::::::::::
87 >>>>>>
88  Leonard, I don't own a 64, I own a Vic.
89 
90 Laissez-aire?(I think that's it).
91  I happen to have been at the Fritz/Geraldine campaign speech. If you seriously think that the US.S. will be better of 
92 with reagen re-elected you are NUTS.
93  Think these small points over.
94  
95  Reagen insists that a tax increase will only happen if it is totally neccasary.  COUNT ON IT IF HE IS RE-ELECTED.
96  He plans on increasing millitary spending by 9% EACH YEAR!  How can he NOT raise taxes???
97   But INCREASE MILLITARY SPENDING?  He is surely insane.
98  
99  Don't expect any arms control talks if reagan is re-elected.
100  
101  But worst of all, (seriously think about this one!) if it (ooops!) HE is re-elected he is free to do as he pleases without
102 haveing to worry about the 88 election year.
103  
104  MEANING, if the prune wishes to enact the draft and send Americas youth to a war
105 in say Alsalvador HE WILL DO IT!  Because it doesn't matter that he will lose popularity, HE COULDN'T GET RE-ELECTED ANYWAY!!
106  
107  Re-electing reagan is like giving Hitler control of America.  The man has no sense of carein except for himself.
108  
109  I am not putting your choice down, and maybe Mondale isn't the best bet, but I really don't feel like getting
110 drafted!
111 
112 
113 But then againg if you enjoy knowing that arms talks have ecollapsed for the first time since the race started, and knowing
114 that rather than cutting back millitary spending will increase yearly by 9%, and knowing that a real BASTARD is in the white
115 house then VOTE for him, but remember, if you were old and living on welfare and you suddenly got sick, there wouldn't be a
116 thing in the world you could do because reagan would CUT your welfare, I should know I watched my Granfather rot away in some
117 god awful hospital because he couldn't afford the kind of treatment he needed.  Needless to say he died.
118 
119 
120 I'm not blameing reagan, but if he hadNn't cut welfare and social security my grandfather MIGHT possibly still
121 be alive today.

125 MIG:  I don't mind you calling me a twit, it's just to bad I'm
126 not as 'mature' or I might call you some 'kiddie' name.
127  I personally think I can use my $1,100 ACE as well as most users of this system.
128  
129  Sorry to use up so much space, just getting my 2 cents worth.

169 Richie Rich - You are indeed free to hold your own opinions, and I will not fault you for them,
170               but have you actually considered the real problem this country faces?  It is not
171               the Russians, or any other ostensibly hostile people, but the threat of economic
172               collapse from within.  This collapse would be made inevitable by the resurgence
173               of the democrats.  The democratic party and the socialist party share everything
174               except their name.  This is not a socialist state, and welfare is not a concept
175               that should be espoused in realistic terms in a representative democracy, or
176               republic, based on the concepts of freedom of expression and free enterprise.
177               Although I feel sorry for your losing your grandfather, (Not for your grandfather
178               as I knew him not, nor his condition.) I must question your motives.  Where were
179               your resources, or those of your parents ?  Is it not the responsibility of each
180               individual to care for his own kin ?  It is not society's burden to care for the
181               old or infirm.  It is the responsibility of each individual to care for himself and
182               his family.  (You biblical scholars will recognize this, as well as those students
183               of history who have studied early American history)
184 
185               As for not wanting to be drafted, I look upon that comment with disgust.  I am sorry
186               if this has the appearance of a personal attack, as it is not meant to be.  It is 
187               merely my reaction to the concept of 'I don't want to fight for my rights, just gimmme'
188               Did your father want to be drafted ?  How about your grandfather ?  Did he WANT to have
189               the chance to die for his country ?  To die to preserve something that he believes
190               in ?  Perhaps, perhaps not.  The point is that many, many people have died to protect
191               your right to whine about not wanting to be drafted.
192               If you do not want to fight to preserve what you have, how about someone just coming
193               over and taking all of your computer equipment away.  After all, there are people in
194               the inner cities of the country who are going to have a tough time making it in business
195               because they do not have access to computers.  Since you believe in welfare, you won't
196               mind, will you ?
197 
198               Reagan is not perfect, we all know that.  His radio check comment was plain stupid,
199               and he has other flaws.  But at least he believes in free enterprise, and does not
200               believe in welfare.  That is the kind of thinking that will keep the country on the
201               road to economic recovery.  Fritz Mondale will put economic progess back to 
202               1976, when the seeds were sown for the bitter harvest of the last recession.

206 Mikey - Since you have not responded, I will take the initiative.  I propose the following:

247 Richie Rich: Where did you get the idea that this is the FIRST time arms control
248 talks have collapsed? 
249         In any case the Soviets are at least as much to blame as the US. Neither
250 side is willing to discuss certain items.
251         As for military spending, while we do need to cut down on waste, we also
252 need to get our NON-nuclear forces into some kind of shape. We could not win a
253 war against anyone even half our size currently. So we either increase spending
254 and bring the Armed Forces up to reasonable equipment & readiness levels, OR we 
255 might as well disband them. (any guess as to what would happen THEN?)
256         As someone once said, "The most expensive luxury in the world is a
257 second best military."

260 A glade along the forest path, at the end of day,
261 Offered kind relief, and so there did the party stay.
262 Escort of a princess, in center did she ride,
263 Going to some noble as his long-awaited bride.
264 
265 Others knew the stewardship of that fighting band,
266 Had an ambush waiting for them in that Judas land.
267 Threw a ring around the camp, men behind each tree,
268 And only Lady Katherine was outside and could flee!
269 Chorus: So run, Lady, run, help is needed desp'rately
270         Footsteps now behind you, or is it but the wind?
271         Stagger 'til your slippers leave a trail of blood to draw the hunt,
272         Perhaps you'll reach a friendly keep, so run, Lady, run!
273 Getting water from a stream, you hear the fight begin,
274 You know the camp will hold for long, but never hope to win.
275 An outside force could lift the siege, did they only know--
276 But foemen saw you leave the camp, so now you've got to go!
277 CHORUS
278 Sprint away from battle sounds, try to follow stars,
279 Never mind your aching lungs or your bramble scars.
280 You think you've lost your chasers, you rest and hear no sounds,
281 But stagger on in terror at the baying of the hounds.
282 CHORUS
283 Lurch from clearing forest, the hunt is drawing nigh,
284 But then you see a stony keep athwart the sunrise sky.
285 Falling at the entryway as legs beneath you fail,
286 But help is now about you as you whisper out your tale.
287 (chorus: instrumental only)
288 The seige was broken that same day, a vict'ry it would seem,
289 But Katherine now walks about within a waking dream.
290 She sees the forest, hears the hunt, her face bespeaks her strife;
291 I fear she will be fleeing for the rest of her life.
292         So run, Lady, run, help is needed desp'rately
293         Footsteps now behind you, or is it but the wind?
294         Stagger 'til your slippers leave a trail of blood to draw the hunt,
295         Someday you'll reach a friendly keep, so run, Lady, run!

326 
327 Laissez-faire,
328      Actually, Mr. Reagan has done very little that is different from what the Democrats did when they held the presidency.
329 He has dramatically increased spending, increased the money supply beyond all need, and his new form of welfare is directed
330 toward industries that have proven themselves incapable of competing in the marketplace, rather than toward the poor.  The
331 Democrats give to the poor who are incapable of supporting themselves, the Republicans give to industries that are incapable
332 of supporting themselves. A new form of welfare to be sure, but welfare all the same.
333      As to the tax give-away, even Mr. Reagan's own economists admit that it did little to help spur the current "recovery".
334 The major industries of this nation took their money and, instead of spending it on modernization of equipment or new jobs,
335 went on a spree of corporate buy-outs, the like of which has never before been seen in this nation.  Housing is still on
336 the rocks, the steel companies are as good as dead, wood products ARE dead, and the only industry that is doing well is the
337 production of various weapon systems.  And as Adam Smith would tell you (if he was alive, that is), the production of weapons
338 only overheats the economy by providing a temporary and artificial stimulus.  It provides some jobs, but produces no goods
339 for the consumer income created by those jobs to purchase.  More money chasing after the same or fewer number of goods will
340 only lead to another round of inflation.  So all Mr. Reagan is doing is the same as Lyndon Johnson did with his escalation
341 of the Viet Nam war: providing a nice deep economic hole for those that follow him to try to climb out of.
342      Please don't think of this as an essay of support for Fritz, as it isn't.  It is just simple recognition that the Rag-Nut
343 is no better.  Yes, once again we are faced with a choice of those that offer nothing more than smoke and mirrors.

372 TO RHICHIE RICH, IT IS SAD THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT REAGAN IS UNCONCERNED WITH THE 88 ELECTIONS. THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON F
373 FICTIONS. HE MUST LEAVE THE VOTERS HAPPY WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OR HIS SUCESSOR WILL NOT BE ELECTED, SO HE WONT DO ANYTHING
374 TOO DRASTIC. I, ALSO, WILL ENLIST WHEN THE CUBANS ARE INVADING, BUT NOT BEFORE. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE THINKING THAT THE 
375 ECONOMY IS BAD, WHEN HAS IT HISTORICALLY BEEN GOOD? THE 70'S DEPRESSION, THE 60'S WAR STIMULUS, THE 50'S KOREAN WAR STIMULUS, 
376 THE 40'S WWII STIMULUS, THE GREAT DEPRESSION, THE FAKE STOCKS IN THE 20'S THE STIMULUS OF WWI, THE 1890'S(MAYBE) THE 1880'S 
377 SILVER GOLD CONTROVERSY, THE 1870'S RECONSTRUCTION, ETC. ETC. ETC. 000000000000
378 AND ALL THROUGHOUT, ORDINARY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RAISING FAMILIES, MAKING A LIVING, AND THE WORLD HAS BEEN JUST ROLLING ALONG. 
379 TRY TO FIND AN IDEAL ECONOMIC DECADE AND YOU CANNOT. THAT IS LIFE. AS FOR THE MUCH EXPOUSED ARMY, I STILL MAINTAIN THAT IT IS 
380 A KILLING MACHINE. I MUCH PREFER TO REMAIN UNDER MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION, EITHER BY MISSILES OR SATELLITES. INDEED, 
381 SATELLITES, BEING A MORE PRECISION WEAPON, CAN DO MUCH TO STAMP OUT THE MINOR LOCAL CONFLICTSBY WAY OF THREAT. S.S. IS AN 
382 OBVIOUS RATHOLE TO POUR MONEY INTO, BUT THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO ELIMINATE IT. IF ANYONE CAN FIND A SOLUTION ACCEPTABLE ANYONE 
383 OTHER THAN A SMALL MINORITY OF PEOPLE, THEY WILL BE PRESIDENT. THE PROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ONE EVER SINCE IT 
384 WAS INTRODUCED. EVEN ROOSEVELT ADMITTED ON HIS DEATHBED THAT HE HAD BETRAYED HIS COUNTRY BY IT'S FORMATION. 
385 +++++++++++++  WELL, I SIGNED ON TO THE SYSTEM WITH THE INTENT OF SAYING GOODBYE TO ALL WHO KNOW AND READ ME, BUT I WAS UNABLE
386 TO HOLD BACK WHEN READING THE DISK. (AS YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY SEE FROM THE ABOVE) I AM GOING TO THE FAMED OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY 
387 NEXT WEEK, AND THE LONG DISTANCE CHARGES ARE GOING TO BE A BIT STEEP SO THIS WILL BE MY LAST SIGNON. ITS BEEN A GOOD YEAR AND 
388 HALF HERE, I THANK ALL WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED MATERIAL TO THIS BOARD. MIKEY, I AM GOING TO BE BUILDING A MINATURE OF THIS BOARD,
389 I LOVE IT SO MUCH. THANKS. 
390 IF ANY OF THE BACKWATER IRREGULARS ARE IN CORVALLIS, STOP BY AND SEE ME, ROOM 219, WEATHERFORD HALL. I STILL WANT THE FORMULA 
391 TO THE VILE ORANGE LIQUID. BYE.

394 WOW! WHAT A CHANGE! LAST TIME I WAS HERE THE STORIES WERE IN FULL SWING,
395 AND MANY PEOPLE WERE ENJOYING THEMSELVES.
396 NOW I FIND AN ABUNDANCE OF QUASI-PERSONAL MESSAGES, AND 1 DISCUSSION ON THE GOV.
397 WHAT HAPPENED??? I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE CURRENT FORMAT(EXCEPT FOR
398 THE SLOWNESS OF THINGS), BUT WHY DID IT CHANGE?
399 I HAVEN'T READ D2, AS TIME PRESSES ON ME, SO CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.
400 MIG: HERE I AM!!!!!!
401 NOW FOR MY 3 CENT'S WORTH(INFLATION, YOU KNOW):
402 
R.R.(A.K.A FOTI):  HOW CAN WE HAVE ARMS TALKS WITH THE USSR IF WE CAN'T HAVE
403 ONE LEADER AROUND FOR ANY AMOUNT OF TIME? THE FIRST TWO WERE INACCESSABLE
404 FOR A LONG TIME, AND THE CURRENT ONE JUST COMPLETED AN 80+ DAY DISAPPEARANCE.
405 ALL: I AGREE THAT S.S. AND WELFARE ARE SO LADEN WITH PROBLEMS THAT THEY SHOULD
406 BE THROW OUT, BUT WHAT DO WE DO WHEN MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE SUDDENLY WITHOUT
407 MONEY? NO MATTER HOW MUCH IT HURTS ME, I FEEL IT IS UNETHICAL TO LET OTHER
408 PEOPLE STARVE, WHEN I CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IF WE COULD QUICKLY EMPLOY
409 ALL THESE PEOPLE, THEN I MIGHT LISTEN, BUT UNTIL THEN......
410 
411 IN ANY CASE, IT'S NICE TO BE BACK, AND I LOOK FOWARD TO SOME MORE ACTIVITY

AROUND HERE!

418 MY COSMIC ADVENTURES ON FERN UNIT
419 by Susan Michelle
420 
421 Let me first inform you that fern Unit is a dark planet and I can't 
422 remember how long I have been living here.  My earliest memory dates 
423 back to the year 0029 when I was just a young tad in dirty dipers.  I
424 can recall rolling around on my belly in the cool sand searching for
425 various tidbits of Fern to endulge upon. I had a small incubator that
426 kept me warm inside until I was old enough to build a shelter.  I made
427 my shelter out of Fern wood and various units that grew along the bank
428 of the River of Dreams.  Sometimes late at night I would watch the river.
429 She was like soft feathers floating in the wind.  Her dreams were always
430 changing and you could never be certain on what she would dream next.  One
431 night I watched her dream of a uncertain stranger with dark hair.  I could
432 feel the energy of this stranger, it was like an aura of bright colors.  I
433 let this sensation surround me until it entered my body and left me feeling
434 experienced inside. I would have to meet this dark haired stranger.  One
435 evening I noticed that my body had devoloped into that of a well devoloped
436 young man.  It was amazing.  I stood outside my shelter for two days admiring
437 my new foundation and even the rocks along the bank were aghast.  I didn't 
438 bother asking my shelter what it thought because my shelter was always silent,
439 as it was made of Fern wood and various units.  The river started to dream so I decided on calling it a night.  Tommorow would
440 be a day which was a major event here on Fern Unit.  
441 (TO BE CONT...........)
442 
443 
444 Richie Rich: It's a bit late to enlist if we're being invaded. As I've said before
445 it takes MONTHS to learn to use anything other than your personal weapons. 
446 And since we can't mantain a major offensive for more than a month....
447 Prometheus: What code does "control-space" send? It is NOT standard! In fact
448 I cannot think of a machine that implements it! I suspect that it sends ^@ (00h)
449 but I have no way of knowing.
450 L'homme: here is the Modem protocol
451 Receiver			Sender
452 <NAK> to start ->
453 (repeat every 10 sec
454 until <SOH> received)
455 				(Wait for initial <NAK>)
456 				<- <SOH>
457 				<- <block #>	(one byte)
458 				<- <block # complemented>
459 				<- <128 data bytes>
460 				<- <cksum> total of data Modulo 256
461 <ACK> or <NAK> ->
462 				Repeat same sector (with same block#)
463 				if <NAK> rcvd or no response (timeout)
464 
465 				Send next block if <ACK> receieved:
466 				<SOH><BLK#><BLK# complemented><DATA><CKSM>
467 
468 (check for repeated block
469 by comparing with previous
470 blk #)
471 				<- <EOT> after <ACK> is received for
472 				  last block
473 
474 Either end can abort transfer by sending <CAN> while the 
475 other end is not transmitting.
476 <SOH> = 01 hex
477 <EOT> = 04 hex
478 <ACK> = 06 hex
479 <NAK> = 15 hex
480 <CAN> = 18 hex

483 It is 05:24, and the last contingent of the Risk Brigade arrived home
484 15 minutes ago. (and with 71 more miles on the car than when we started).
485 Why, oh why do we torture ourselves so?  I suppose it's either because we are
486 masochists, or else because the Risk is fun and Alex is a good host
487 (although he does extract his payment by winning the first game every night).
488 Well, time to move on to the other three boards I need to call before I can
489 go to bed (it's a fetish of mine, you know - got to check all my usual boards
490 else something dire will happen...)

493 Well,  I haven't been here for quite a while and it has changed a lot.
494    When I first logged on I left a message under the name of 'Lord Grimsbe'.
495 Then I found another name and continued to use this system.  I can't remember
496 which name it was because I hace had so many.  I stoped calling after I was
497 blamed for a bunch of things that I didn't type in but thats all history.
498 And if Mig is still keeping track of what boarders people use when they log-on
499 then my page must be filled.  During the 'juvie hunt' I was responsible for
500 a good 4 people that were juvies.  And 2 that were not.  I never did write
501 a story, that was all that was going on when I first saw it.  People were
502 just writing stories and this board was a happy one.  And now, everyone is
503 either fighting and cussing other people out or they are just ingnoring them
504 alltogether.  You might want to change the name from Backwater to Warboard.
505 I too am not going to call again, everytime I do all I see is what I don't
506 want to see.  Thats what is going on.  Piper is one of the last survivors.
507 What happened to all the writers?  Not what is on today but the writers. 
508 Here is a list of the names that I used, if you see them on old listings have
509 fun.  
510    Lord Grimsbe, Luke Binkelywalker, Whiteliner, The Archer, Griff, 
511 Mark St.Clair, New User, Juvie, J.C and the boys, J.C and the Sunshine band,
512 Desenter, Figg, xxxxx, Atari user.  I left numerous unsinged messages on this
513 board too.  I used so many different boarders that it would takr a long time
514 and space to write them all down.
515    See ya when I might see ya.

523 All I can say is, "Thank heavens for Nuclear Risk. It seems to be the only
524    game one of the rest of us can win. Alex seems to dominate the normal Risk
525    game with his Red Plague. It maniacally devours all who oppose it. A curse

528 voyeur : More profuse thanks must come forth for your gallent and comfortable
529    transportation. I think I can speak for the other riskers, (they should
530    speak for themselves too) when I say, "Merci!"
531    We can go in my car again next time, cramped back seat and all...
532 Ninja again : Are you out there? Please leave me a private message on CBBS/PCS

543 I slept uneasy that night.  My mind was awake and ticking.  I had placed a
544 skylight made of Fern glass in my shelter a few years ago and my bed lye
545 beneath it which made sleeping peacefull.  Sometimes I would watch the stars
546 for hours until I dozed off.  On a clear night I could see it raining on the cir
547 cling moon, Fern Dock.  I would like to travel there someday for I have heard
548 there are many dimensions of Fern there.  Fern is very important.  If it wasn't
549 for Fern, I would be nothing but a skeleton of a baby.  I sometimes feel I owe
550 my entire life to the many and plentiful varieties of shrubs of Fern.  
551 My heart was beating fast when I wakened.  I had forgotton that it would be a
552 day outside and I had not prepared myself. I had started to knit a pair of swim-

560 Oh yes, Risk. Now the aftereffects of the V.O.L. are wareing off. And isn't 
561 PorSFiS today? maybe I should go. Mmaybe I should get out of bed first.
562 So many disisions, and so few brain cells operating at any speed.
563 Hawthorne:Saturday market? dear deity, I don't remember how to get there,
564 bought some ear-rings there about a year ago, give me directions from the 
565 mall.

572 the food was good, the drink was swell
573 We ate our meals, you this we tell.
574 P C and S, the numbers shrink,
575 what causes this, I pause to think.
576 What dire deed could cause this lapse,
577 Maybe some anger, apathy perhaps.
578 The cycle of Back Water, has come around.
579 The time is nigh for us to clown.
580 Some fun and games we all need now
581 I'm sick and tires, of beating brows.
582 Take this idea, ponder it with care.
583 It could start something, if we dare.
584 The chance we take will be our own.
585 It will make us better, we'll have truly grown.
