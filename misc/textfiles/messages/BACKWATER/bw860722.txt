89 This Wonderful Reprint was brought to you by -Beatrice-  (A division of CCM/DL)
90 
91  Downloaded this from another BBS in town and thought you might like it!
92 I would like to ask one question of Mikey or some of the people
93 associated with this system!  Why is this system so slow at taking uploads??
94 I realize that the system is an old homebrew type that is liminted in
95 its capabilities and speed but it seems to be fast at output but not on input.
96 I have to take my hat off to the owner who keeps a system that stays the
97 same for many years and people can get used to it's operation and functions.
98 But why can't that one item be improved.  Would it be that hard to speed it up?
99 I send as slow as my terminal program will send and it still drop an occasional
100 character.  Would it require a total redesign of the hardware to 
101 instigate such a simple upgrade of the system's preformance???
102 Thanks in advance for your courteous response

180    The elevator trip to the ground floor took seconds, but it was enough time
181 for Parity to comprehend the seriousness of Fellows' condition. A large piece
182 of broken glass from the window in the hotel room had torn into Fellows' side.
183 His side was covered with blood, as Parity's hand did not make the greatest
184 compound bandage, and there had been no time to administer the proper frantic-
185 first-aid.
186    As the mirrored doors of the elevator slid open, Parity, still holding
187 the unconscious Fellows around the waist, peeked around the corner and into
188 the lobby of the Westward Ho Motel. The lobby was uncrowded. It appeared to
189 Parity that most of the people normally in the lobby this time of day were

190 outside investigating, gawking, and generally making a nuisance of themselves
191 amid the rubble that had descended from above, curtsey of one NET booby-trapped
192 CD case.
193    Parity cinched up the packs, the CD/ROM container, and the COMSET. He
194 dragged Fellows as best he could to the rear doors and the parking lot that
195 faced Industrial Road behind the Westward. Parity could hear the wail of
196 more and more sirens. Las Vegas put on a real show of force when bombs went
197 boom along the strip. He knew he didn't have much time to get out the hotel
198 before the police figured out where the blast came from and sealed off the
199 place.
200    As the two agents passed the foreign exchange desk, deserted except
201 for a young woman at the counter, Parity lost his grip of Fellows, who went
202 tumbling to the carpet in a limp pile. The woman sprang up from her desk
203 and approached the pair of agents cautiously
204    "Is your friend all right?" she asked innocently.
205    "Oh, him. He's just had a few too many over in the casino. He'll be
206 alright." Parity tried to keep himself between the woman and wound,
207 but it was pretty difficult when the blood was all over Fellows' clothes.
208    "Is that... Is that blood?" Tension had entered her voice.
209    "Just a nick madame. I'm taking him to his doctor right now." By now Parity
210 had Fellows back up and was starting to turn towards the parking lot entrance.
211    "Please, wait. I'll call an ambulance. And there's plenty of emergency
212 people outside, with the blast... and... all" She looked directly at Parity,
213 then over to the slumping Fellows, then to the blood running between Parity's
214 fingers. Parity could see the gears turning, as she started to make what
215 ever connections she could from the visual evidence.
216    "My friend is hurt. I need to get him to some help. Who ever you call
217 will just slow my helping him down. Please, help me by doing what I ask."
218 Parity knew that if she called out front the hotel would be crawling with
219 inquisitive cops in seconds. He would not have enough time to get outside,
220 find a car, and drive off without arousing any more suspicion than
221 necessary.
222    "What do you want me to do?" She stepped forward, hands out. "Can I help
223 you carry him?"
224    "Thank you. Hold his side. Sorry about the blood. I need to get to the
225 parking lot and find my car." They started moving towards the door.
226 Parity still carried the baggage, and held up one side of Fellows. The
227 woman placed her hand directly over the worst part of the wound. In seconds
228 her hand and lower arm were covered with the crimson evidence of Fellows'
229 injury.
230    "How did he get..." She stopped in the middle of her question, as if she
231 already knew the answer, but did not want to know it from Parity.
232    At last they reached the door, which fortunately was electronic. It opened
233 with a mechanical swoosh. The hot air from outside was a sharp contrast to
234 the cool air-conditioned interior of the Westward Ho. Fellows shuddered a
235 bit, and the woman sucked in her breath, but kept her hand firmly on the wound.
236    Parity spotted a late model domestic sedan one row over, about twenty yards
237 from the entrance they just emerged from.
238    "Our car is over there, the green Ford LTD." Parity pointed with a jerk
239 of his head toward the car. "Just a few more feet old buddy." The woman smiled
240 weakly. Fellows was in no condition to respond.
241    They were almost to the car when a police cruiser pulled in to the parking
242 lot from a connecting lane with the Castaways Hotel. The driver of the car
243 must have spotted them immediately, because he turned his lights on and drove
244 in their direction.
245    Parity and the woman saw the police car at the same time. He knew they would
246 have to act quickly.
247    "OK, can you hold him against the car while I unlock the door?" A nod, and
248 Parity let go of Fellows. He extracted a small set of entry devices from his
249 front pocket and started working on the car door.
250    "The police can help your friend." The woman said with a pleading voice.
251    "They can also ask a lot of questions. There, the door is unlocked. Help
252 me get him in." As carefully as they could, Parity and the woman lowered
253 Fellows into the passenger car seat. Trying not to step on Fellows, Parity
254 climbed over him and got in to the driver's seat. The COMSET and other
255 equipment was thrown in the back seat. In five more seconds the car's steering

256 wheel was unlocked and the car was started.
257    The woman looked in apprehensively. "I won't ask about the car. I hope you
258 find help for him." She looked at Fellows, then at her blood covered hand.
259    "Thank you, miss... I'm sorry, but we've got to go." Parity put the car
260 in gear and stepped on it just as the police car pulled up behind. He could
261 see in the rear-view mirror the woman run in front of the police car just as
262 it started to turn and follow. Parity knew the police car could not follow,
263 but he also knew there were plenty of others in the area that could.
264 He looked over at Fellows, head lolling in motion with the car, and hoped
265 he could find help in time.

272 WELCOME home Mikey. A call to the Hospital revealed you had been discharged.
273 My apologies to the elderly woman who now occupies your old room. As you can
274 see, Backwater has more or less survived, thanks to the phantom of backwater,
275 whom ever that might be. The big question now is, are you feeling up to some
276 visitors, bringing tidings of good joy. It is good to have you back!

278 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZoom...
279 Mikey *was* in the hospital? What for? Why does nobody ever tell me thos things?
280 Bravo to the spy story writers! I don't know why anybody would call them junk,
281 as I find them far more interesting than the 'kiddie sysop' arguments and 
282 various other miscellanious stuff left here. The Murphy's law list was fun, 
283 though overlong, though. We need more original fiction here. I know it's 
284 summer and computing is the last thing on most of you people's minds, but some
285 (nuts) anonymous borders? And whatever happened to all the GOOD writers, anyway?
286 I only see one that has been active on the last two disks. Whatever happened to
287 Emu's tale? How about some more fantasy stories? And whatever happened to 
288 Silverman's story? I was enjoying it immensely. Did he die or what? 
289 Let's see some interesting stuff going here, OK? I would post some myself, but,
290 alas, I have not the talent, as you can see. 
291 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZoom...
292 Oops! Up between "some" and "(nuts)" in my message was supposed to be the line
293 "people are still leaving messages. Can the do something besides leave complaints and-"
294 (accidently hit "break" instead of "return". I **HATE** Atari keyboards!!)
295 One more time:
296 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZoom!
297 Did you know that the Spy vs. Spy story is actually *longer* than the
298 murphy's law list?  Well, did you?  Naw, I thought not.  Please check into
299 these things before you say the Spy story is good and Murphy's Law is too long.
300 I myself would prefer to read the kiddie-sysop debate rather than these boring
301 Spy and Dungeon & Dragons stories.  In fact, the last disk was the first time
302 I've ever actually sat down and read an entire disk on Backwater.  I didn't
303 have to do any DO 30's when I got to the boring, long-winded stories.
304 Naturally, no one will agree with me, since you're all too mature to prefer a
305 good debate to a poorly written tale by some amateur.  Don't get me wrong.
306 I don't have anything against books or stories.  I probably have read and
307 enjoy reading more than my share.  I just dislike reading these amateur
308 attempts at writing.  I'm willing to bet that more people are reading my entry
309 than the Spy story above.  Why?  Certainly not because I'm a better writer.
310 It's just that the story is BORING!  This entry, however, has more impact
311 on most 'patrons' of this system.  That's why entries such as Beatrice's get
312 more response than these bad attempts at good writing (Spy).  And for what
313 it's worth, I don't care much for Dr. Who either.

350  Well, Well!!!   I left town for a week and  I find my first message
351 still intact on BWMS.  I didn't expect to start such a wild debate, but merely
352 ask an honest and sincere question that was avoided by making lame technical
353 excuses as to why my messages are always deleted on BWMS.  First of all, I
354 always execute a "OFF" command before I hang up and I know about drive "B."  Second, I really don't believe
355 that even Mikey and his cronies just happen to accidentally leave the system in
356 some edit mode every time I leave a message, and that the twit who calls in
357 every time deletes just my messages.  While I am being disagreeable, I would
358 like to state for the record that I also don't believe messages from supposed
359 "NON-Mikey-cronies".  Gentlemen, Gentlemen, I am not trying to start rave
360 controversy over the operating practices of BWMS, I am just trying to find the
361 true story behind the editing process on this mysterious system.  It is obvious
362 that they are not what they are outlined as being.  Let's let the log-on message
363 speak for itself:
364 ********************************************************************************
365 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privately owned
366 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
367 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system. As the system is
368 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
369 I may find offensive.
370 
371 ********************************************************************************
372   Are messages to friends about meetings and the like considered "Offensive??"
373 I would really hope not!  In college I had a language professor who despised 
374 general discussion of anything.  He thrived on controversy and "intellectual"
375 debates of any orgin.  Some friends of mine have suggested that this is the desired operation of BWMS?  Are entries of a
376 "non-intellectually stimulating" nature undesirable here??  If so I see no
377 crime in making it known.  The only problem I have with that theory is that I
378 see codes, childish arguments and other "intellectually-offensive" entries that
379 remain on the disk until it is removed from drive "B" and dies a normal BWMS

380 death.  As I have stated before, I am in no way demanding my rights to use
381 Mikey's personal equipment.  I'm merely asking a simple question as to --WHY--.
382 Why are such harmless messages deleted?  Or is it that there is something
383 going on with all of these "codes," something that no one is allowed to know
384 and BWMS is a front for the MAFIA!!!!!!!!!

390 OH QUIT WHINING!
391 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZoom...
392            Toro;
393 Your 'rebuttal' to my statement is so one-sided and opinionated that it can
394 hardly be called that. First off, the actual length of the entries in question
395 had nothing to do with my remarks on them. The Murphy's law list was long
396 because lists tend to wear on the reader after a certain point and I thought
397 that entry had passed that point. I did not notice the length of the spy story
398 because it had a plotline that more than held my interest throughout. I have
399 thoroughly enjoyed the stories that have been put on this board in the past,
400 amatuer or not. granted, some have been mediocre or just plain trash (Re: The
401 Destroyer) but some others have been surprisingly good (Emu and Parity, to name
402 a couple). And I don't think others will disagree with you because they are too
403 'mature', but rather because their tastes differ from yours. This board is ment
404 for the posting of any non-obscene non-garbage material and that means that the
405 writers have just as much right to be here as the 'kiddie-sysop' debators and
406 the others. It's just that the writers have been conspicuously absent lately
407 and I hoped perhaps to draw some out. Futile hope. And I don't know about your
408 message being more interesting than the stories. Personally, I dozed off twice
409 while reading it.
410 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
411 	Toro, of course you enjoyed the last disk, which was called by half-
412 a-dozen other back water writers one of the worst disks of all time. And most
413 of us have seen all-time. Those childish messages do not warrent being called
414 debates. They are name-calling arguments akin to some kid who doesn't get his
415 own way and throws a tantrum so everyone else can see just how upset he is.
416 It is amazing that people intelligent enough to hook up a computer, modem,
417 and software and call a board suddenly take an IQ nose-dive as soon as they
418 hear a carrier. I haven't seen such actions since I was in grade school.
419 Fortunately, that was some time ago.
420 	Since you seemingly have nother better to do that bitch, why don't
421 you try and help improve things. Show us what a good writer you are by
422 entering something other than whinning little diatribes against anyone who
423 happens to be in range. Indulge in a real debate. State your point, and
424 LISTEN to other's points of view. Anything less will further show the others
425 on this board just how little you are. Show us you are better than that.
426 Build your self up not by cutting others down as you have done in the past,
427 but by making a good reputation for yourself. If you can't do that, leave us
428 in peace. Certainly there are more entertaining things to do if Backwater is
429 as bad as you say.

439 ********************THE PHANTOM OF BACKWATER******************************
440 I fail to see why most people on here complained of the "kiddie-sysop" debate.  I was called one and I stood up for myslf.
441 What is wrong with that??????

444 Ya know I really feel like writing a good story right now, but when I hear people continually b****ing about how offen-
445 sive they find other peoples entries and how amateurish other's stories are, I really don't feel that I need to waste m 

446 time trying to give some kind of enjoyment to those who are just going to "DO 30"  when they see the beginning.
447 Oh well.

450 Minutes later, a NET vehicle crew arrived and took the van, leaving a
451 nondescript Mustang behind as transportation for the agents.  Farley's mind
452 buzzed with thoughts and half-worked-out theories, which mercifully blanketed
453 his fustration for the time being.
454 "I've never heard of a case of sabotage within NET, James.  Never."  A quiet
455 statement.  James just sat unmoving in the passenger seat, with only a twitch
456 of a muscle given as a response for several long seconds.  "Yeah.  But androids
457 and CD roms haven't been walking the earth before, either.  Somethin's screwy
458 here, I dunno what...another one of my hunches, I guess."
459 Eugene considered that.  "I'm beginning to trust your intuition."  He brought
460 the Mustang into HHQ entry #7, the sub-sub-level of a parking structure that
461 was close to HQ, but not too near-  and still, after the automatic transport
462 ride, Farley was not sure exactly where HQ was.  "Time to put some questions to
463 Nick.  He should be around."
464 Dull procedure executed perfectly got the agents past Outer Security, and a
465 lift took them to Douglas' Robotics Section.
466 It was a perfect, beautiful white.  Eugene wondered for a moment if Nick ever
467 suffered from eyestrain from the glare, when the roboticist himself poked his
468 goggled head out his office door.

486 Thanks to those who have mentioned my name when discussing writers that

488 a little more time (?) and when I have a little more plot figured out.
489 I believe that there are some outstanding authors on this board, most of
490 whom are lurking at present.  At least a couple NET agents are continuing
491 their thread.  I'd like to hear from Piper and some other "oldtimers".

505 Awake again. I7m glad to see that the spy stories weren't discouraged by the
506 ravings of the philistines on this board. the only complaint I would have 
507 about you spy writers is that I have never seen you finish what you started.
508 I have seen so many interesting storylines fade from lack of writer intrest
509 or lack of time. I hope this current storyline continues to a conclusion as
510 it may be the best one yet...

551 
552    Crying softly to myself, I continue north through the sleeping pines and dozi
553 ng willows. Morning air with a slight nip, washing past my hair, and soul.
554 What's wrong with me? Why do I feel this way?
555   The song of an ancient reptillian bird echos through the background. Coming
556 closer, I must hide... Sounds of despair and death, remain hovering in the air,
557 for anyone to hear; anyone who may be around.
558    Weeks later, still going north. The spark is gone and I am cold. Hate and
559 frusteration as my only companions, my heart is blue, frozen. Bad memories
560 follow me; a haunting presence that persists in staying. Annoyed, I try to
561 ignore it:
562    "I can't wait to get out of this miserbal state..." "But I've finally found
563 a group of friends, set down ties! Please don't move me. I want to..." 
564 "...you can make new friends. I don't like it here. What I say goes." "Why do
565 you always have to dominate other peoples lives? You only care for yourself!"
566 "Shutup! Don't you ever Don't you ever talk to me that way again in my house.
567 you're lucky to have such a nice home."
568    One of the last arguements I had with him. Well, I'm not in his "nice home"
569 anymore.
