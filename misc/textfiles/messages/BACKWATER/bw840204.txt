21 HAVE TO TRAVEL SEVERAL MILES THRU HEAVILY BUILT UP AREAS TO GET HERE.

27 THE NOISE AND DISTURBANCES JUST TO GET AT THE SHRUB IN FRONT OF MY WINDOW
28 WHEN I AM SURE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE EASILY ACCESIBLE MATERIAL
29 IN THE AREA WHERE HE CAME FROM. BY THE WAY, HE CAME BACK TONIGHT TO

44 Cistop Mikey, I'm not too surprised to hear about your nocturnal visitor.
45 He obviously heard about a good board in the area and stopped by to get 
46 to gnaw all about it. It's just a natural mistake that he's barking up the
47 wrong tree, and stuck out in the bush leagues; how was he to gnaw that your
48 backwater wouldn't mean a dam thing to him?
49 Maybe you should change the name to the BeaverBoard.

53 	Grasping Tarn by the scruff of the neck Emer drags him
54 out of the forest and deposits him at the side of the road. 
55 "Quit being such a pest!" she exclaims. "I will not have you
56 ruining my good jerkin again!"
57 	Surprised and hurt at such rough treatment from his
58 friend, Tarn stares after her as she heads off down the road
59 once more.  "Did I do something wrong?" he calls out after
60 her, but she does not hear.  Not knowing what to make of this
61 abrupt change in her person, Tarn turns away and with head
62 down cast trudges down the road towards the city.
63 	As he passes the Inn he does not notice the angery
64 shouts and calls that emit from within.  Nor does he notice
65 the man dressed in a kilt much further down the road.  He does
66 however notice the minstral who rushes across the bridge
67 followed by a streem of debre from the direction of the Inn as
68 one of the peices stikes him in the head.  Turning to curse
69 the person who would do such a thing, all he sees are the
70 backs of the group as they reenter the Inn laughing.  Out in
71 the street plays a runny nosed brat.  
72 	Turning away, Tarn continues his slow ploding in the
73 direction of the city.  A cold east wind begins to blow
74 chilling him to the bone, while overhead the clouds turn dark
75 and a slow drizzle begins to fall.  A suitible condition to
76 match his mood.  
77 	The Innkeeper stepping outside for a breath of fresh
78 air, looks down the road to see a lone figure, head down,
79 sholders slumped, with his cloak wrapped tightly about his thin
80 frame heading down the road away from the Inn.

93 in high school I was kicked out of my freshman metalshop class for reading too 
94 much.in my senior year i was kicked out of SCHOOL
95 for reading too much/skipping clases to go to the local comp. room and program

116 GENERAL MACAIBO: I WILL, INDEED READ THIS ARTICLE, BUT I'M PROBABLY
117 PRETYY FAMILAR WITH MOST ARGUMENTS. THIS SUBJECT HAS BEEN A CONTINOUS
118 STUDY OF MINE FOR AT LEAST 10 YEARS. AS TO THE LIGHT THING, I AND THE
119 BIBLE TOTALLY AGREE. YOU PROBABLY MISSED PART OF THE OPENING DISCUS-
120 SION. SO LET ME SHARE ONE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED POINT. THE BIBLE CREA-
121 TIVE DAYS WERE THOUSANDS OF YEARS LONG, EACH. THIS BEING BACKED UP
122 BY BIBLE CHRONOLOGY AND SCIENCE. FOR INSTANCE PLANTS WERE FIRST, AC-
123 COUNTING FOR THE FIRST CAMBRIAN LAYER, AND ON DOWN THE LINE. EACH
124 EXISTING THOUSANDS OF YEARS BEFORE THE NEXT CAME ON THE SCENE. ALSO
125 THE BIBLE ONLY DEALS WITH WHAT WAS DONE WITH THE EARTH. THE UNIVERSE
126 INCLUDING THE EARTH WAS ALREADY HERE, NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY MILLIONS,
127 HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS , OR WHATEVER. WE CAN ONLY GUESTAMATE BY SOME-
128 WHAT UNRELIABLE DATING METHODS.
129 BY THE WAY ARE  YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE SCIENCE OF PROBABILITIES?
130 MAN IN GREY: CONSIDER THIS. IN OUR PRESENT CONDITION, IF ALL BELIEVED
131 THE SAME, WOULD THAT NOT INDICATE THAT GOD HAD PRODUCED MERELY A PLA-
132 NET OF ROBOTS. ALL BELIEVING AND THINKING THE SAME. WHICH WOULD BE IM-
133 POSSIBLE NOW, BECAUSE OF THE MANY BARRIERS IN SOCIETY, AND WE ALL
134 MAKE MISTAKES IN BELIEF AND PERCEPTION ANYWAY. AND WHAT CREDIT WOULD 
135 IT BE TO SUCH A PERSONAGE TO MAKE ROBOTS? EVEN MAN CAN DO THAT.
136 BUT RATHER PEOPLE WITH FREE CHOICE CHOOSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS PART
137 IN THE UNIVERSE. JUST A THOUGHT.
138 ON THE TOPIC OF TODAYS EDUCATION, IT STINKS. NOT ALTOGETHER, BUT SEG-
139 MENTS. MY PROFESSION IS ONE THAT I DEAL WITH PARENTS AND STUDENTS
141 AND PRETTY MUCH OF AN INFORMAL BASIS. PARTICULARLY HIGH SCHOOL AGE.
142 SHOCKED IS A MILD DESCRIPTION AS TO WHAT I FELT WHEN I TOOK THIS
143 JOB 3 YEARS AGO. MOST, NOT ALL, OF THESE YOUTHS WOULD BE DROPPED BACK
144 SEVERAL GRADES IN GERMANY, AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES ON THE EARTH
145 THESE DAYS FOR THAT MATTER. MANY OF THEM COME FROM EXTREME FAMILY
146 SITUATIONS, SUCH AS CHILD ABUSE BACKGROUNDS, ETC. MORE ATTENTION
147 NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO COPING WITH PROBLEMS AND THEN GET ON TO THE 
148 LEARNING IN ERNEST. TEACHERS ARE UNDER PAID FOR THE CRAP THEY 
149 HAVE TO PUT UP WITH. MUCH TIME IS WASTED JUST TRYING TO CONTROL
150 CLASSROOM SITUATIONS. I COULD RANT AND RAVE ABOUT THIS FOR DAYS,
151 SO IT'S BEST I GO FOR NOW, AND TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO ANOTHER.

176 "Christians at War" & many other goodies (including the "What is a SCAB" that 
177 I've seen reprinted in many places)

179 THID BOARD IS WIERD! LIKE TOTALLY!
180 ..................................
181 Dr Buck:	There are several philosophical problems with the "evidence of a long
182 past history created" theory. The biggest is that by using that kind of
183 reasoning, you can't prove that the universe has ANY history. If you allow all
184 these things to be created as part of the "act of creation", the universe may 
185 have been created only a second ago! There is NO way to disprove it, if you 
186 allow such GROSS violations of the law of parsimony (Occam's razor). In fact,
187 this kind of thing is WHY the law of parsimony was invented!
188 
189 To: All history/religion debaters	Re: language use
190 	Please remember that the Bible & other such documents were NOT written
191 in modern times or in English! I realize that that should be obvious, but some 
192 of the recent arguments disappear if you remember this.
193 1. Someone mentioned "they said THOUSANDS, not BILLIONS"
194 	With the exception of the late Greeks, the largest NAMED number was
195 one thousand. The Greeks had a word (mryiad) for a unit of 10 thousand. All 
196 larger numbers had to be described as tens, hundreds, or thousands of thousands.
197 The word million was invented during the renaisance.
198 2. Someone else DID bring up the subject of differing translations of the Bible.
199 They didn't go far enough. Most ancient languages did not even have WORDS for 
200 many of these things we are debating! So how can you expect their writings to 
201 say anything useful about them? (As an example, the use of the word "spirit" in 
202 the bible is solely an artifact of translation! The original word in the 
203 locations where you see "spirit" is the word for "breath". Though this is not
204 as much of an error as it may seem. There was no word for "spirit", but at that 
205 time the only way to distinguish between the living & the dead was that if you
206 were alive, you breathed. If you were dead, you didn't. Since there were NO 
207 exceptions to this rule, it came to be felt that there was some "mystical
208 connection" between living & breathing. One might even go so far as to say 
209 breath IS life. [this may explain early attempts at artificial respiration!] )
210 	(Thus we see that "His spirit left him", was a poetic way of saying "He died")
211 
212 Mikey:	As to the beaver, perhaps the bush is "beaver-nip"? And if you live near 
213 Johnson Creek I don't think it is all THAT built up. Remember the deer that took
214 wrong turn after swimming the Willamette (a common occurence, I am told)
215 (no, no, the SWIMMING- not the wrong turn!)
216 Anyway, it wound up in Lloyd Center. Now THAT is BUILT-UP!

219   ...Huge star marble letters a full two meters tall (gigantic by Ekks
220 standards) spelled out EKK COLLEGE in the finely mosaic tiled mall.  The
221 EKK buildings were of course for the Ekk's version of the humanities and
222 social sciences.  The C was the chemistry building, O for oceanographic
223 sciences, L's for linguistics and laborotories, E for Ekk administration,
224 G for geo and astro physics, and the other E building for Everything
225 Else.  They thought it clever, but how high of standards can green
226 pustules have?
227      Bright green splotches flashed and writhed on the surfaces of the 
228 letters where classes were in session.  You see, the Ekks communicate
229 by electric pulses generated by polarized body contact, so they group
230 together edge to edge on the surface of the building to group 
231 communicate.  One would think this would be a problem in long distance
232 communication, but the Ekks are also anaerobic, and thier home world
233 is covered completely a hundred Ekks thick.  A message is just passed
234 on anywhere in their world.  Rather the cosmos' biggest party line.  The
235 first Terrans to step foot on the planet found themselves literally
237 maybe you can guess how the planet Ekk got named.
238      The Wiz was a tall protly fellow, not unlike the Terrans, busily
239 setting up his apparatus and making gesticulations at one corner of
240 the mall.  At least he had some consideration for others, most gf
241 his dry skin was covered in a slick, if artificial, covering, 
242 attractively accentuating his paunch.  The head was still uncovered,
243 revealing human-like features with dark hair covering most of the
244 skull changing to gray at the sides...

248         Walking into the Inn, I fail to see Tarn in his usual spot, and that
249 frightens me a bit. I fear that I may have offended in our last encounter
250 by my somewhat rough language and treatment of him. His changes in mood can
251 have a great effect upon my own, and I fear that his depression has resulted
252 in depression in me.
253         Sitting at the bar, I ask the Innkeeper for warm brandy, and slowly
254 begin to sink into a ruminative mood, so much so one might think me cowed. I
255 slowly drink and think, feeling that many things in my life might have been
256 different. My best friend who died those many years ago through misuse of a
257 horse, who might have lived if I had not been overly concerned with my own
258 personal pleasures, and whose remains I had to claim from the holding place
259 of the city. How can I forget her laughing, lovely face, her warm humor and
260 strength? And how can I forget the sight of her as she lay there, a waxen
261 mannequin in her image?
262         A muffled sob escapes my throat, and a nearby patron stares at me as
263 though I had interfered with his debating unproveable issues. "Excuse me, I
264 was just clearing my throat.." I lie quickly in order to hide my weakness.
265 I leave my half-finished brandy at the bar (knowing that someone in THIS
266 crowd will finish it) and approach the Innkeeper.
267         "Have you seen Tarn this evening? I usually can find him here, but I
268 haven't seen him." I ask.
269         "Yes, I saw him just an hour ago, walking toward the city. He looked
270 even more depressed than usual, if that is possible!" he responds jovially.
271         "The city....!" Fear lends wings to my feet as I run quickly from
272 Inn, hurdle the small Rowan growing by the gate, and dissapear down the road
273 toward the city.
274         "But what about your bill and..." the Innkeeper pauses, then begins
275 to chuckle as he sees he is talking to empty space. "Oh well," he laughs,
276 "she'll be back in good time. I'll catch her for the tab then!"

280 Yes, I agree that the state of public education is a sorry thing indeed.
281 My own experience was a dismal one; the only year I learned much during
282 school hours was the time the teacher decided I was too much trouble to
283 deal with and left me alone at the back of the room all year, happily 
284 reading the Encyclopedia Britannica! I read the whole thing several times
285 that year. That was the same year I was sent to special classes for 
286 "problem students"!
287 Since then I have observed many other schools in operation and have come
288 to the conclusion that I was in a better-than-average one, in a time of
289 better education overall.
290 Note on a previous message: I wasn't implying that book-like perfection
291 was easy, only stating that we have many examples available of how to do
292 it right. I'd think that given our constant exposure to "right" ways,
293 "wrong" ones would actually require greater effort to execute.

307 Leonard:
308      You may not have seen it, but earlier I said that you can not prove
309 either side. There is allways the chance that someone is trying to trick
310 us. However, that is a different subject and when having these debates, we
311 should assume that no one out there is trying to pull the wool over our eyes.
312 Man in Gray:
313      You said you were a published Sci-Fi author. (I think?) What is your
314 real name? (I was wondering. If you want, though, you can just stay M.i.G.
315 and I'll stay as doctor.)
316 Here's a little fuel for this discussion:
317     1) Petroleum and natural gases are held under high pressure. This 
318 pressure can only be held up for 10,000-100,000 years.
319    2) Meteorites have been plunging to the Earth's surface for it's entire
320 history. Meteorites only exist in the upper layers of the Earth's strata.
321    3) The salinity level of the ocean is not high enough to support a young
322 Earth. This is true with other chemicals in the ocean.
323    4) The rate of Helium release from the atmosphere is not enough to 
324 compensate for the He due to radioactive decay over billions of years.
325    5) The amount of carbon-14 is increasing in the Earth's carbon due to
326 cosmic rays. The amount of carbon-14 present the Earth's age can be 
327 calculated at 12,500 years.

334 ########################################
335 
336 I'm sick and tired of the statements that teachers are underpaid, How many
337 professions can you name that make 20-40k a year for only 9 months labor.
338 Don't give me that the hours they put in at home etc make up for it. There
339 are many who put in a lot more hours and never get paid for it. all the 
340 work that is brought home from places like Tek, Intel, etc yet their starting
341 pay is at best 12k a year. If you want more you had damn well do more!!
342 Sure Teachers have a rough time of it but so do Linemen for PGE out in the
343 ice and rain at all hours, but I don't see them getting three months off
344 each year! Teachers have to deal with
345 discipline, well so do our Police but they don't go on astrike or hold up
346 the public for unreasonable pay. If it's too hot in the kitchen get out.
347 A good Teacher doesn't have problems in the class room as he/she won't allow
348 problems to exist. Sure, we all could use more money but where is it to come
349 from. Why should I pay for your kids or you for mine. But that's another 
350 subject!!!
351 
352 Deborah: What did you mean by name calling? I don't recall using anything
353 that could be construed as name calling. I have always considered those that 
354 have to use crutches (see above) as a burden on the rest of us and that
355 definately includes the religious, especially Christians!

473 THIS BOARD IS GETTING HARDER THAN EVER TO GET ON.
474 
475 AS FOR THE EVIDENCE ON THE AGE OF THE EARTH: WHEN CONSIDERING THE HELIUM IN
476 THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE, DOES THIS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DIFFUSION OF THE 
477 HELIUM (A VERY LIGHT ELEMENT) INTO SPACE; AND AS FOR METEORITES, THEY TEND
478 TO FALL VICTIM TO THE SAME PROCESSES WHICH ATTACK AND ERODE TERRESTRIAL
479 ROCKS, LOSING THIER IDENTITY OVER TIME. MANY OF THE OTHERS ARE NOT AS CLEAR
480 CUT AS THEY APPEAR, WHAT ABOUT THE SALT AND OTHER ELEMENTS IN THE OCEAN, IS 
481 THE SALT THAT IS DEPOSITED CHEMICALLY ON THE BOOTTOM OF THE OCEANS AND TRAPPED
482 IN THE THOUSANDS OF FEET OF SEDIMENTS DOWN THERE. 
483     WELL SO MUCH FOR EVIDENCE, IT NEVER IS A NEAT AS YOU WOULD LIKE.

494 I myself only use a border sporadically, all the best ones having been taken
495 , and so I suppose CYM is right about my being a parasite. I have always 
496 relied on the borders of (semi-) strangers.
497 I like the idea of throwing all violent/antisocial types out of school.
498 In my wild youth I had a short temper and would have been out very fast,
499 thus freeing me from all the time wasted in school and improving my 
500 education immensely! I also like the idea of the universe being created
501 one second ago, but I like better the idea of a universe continually in
502 the process of being created anew, or at least I did during the last 
503 universe. They just don't make realities like they used to!

511 Right now there is a great cry going out from the right-wing fundalmentalists as
512 to the credibility of the school system. With those persons agreeing (somewhat)
513 with me, I'm not so sure the schools are so bad. After all any place that can
514 keep religion OUT can't be all bad.

517 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
518 WHAT I MEANT BY SOME NEWER TRANSLATION BEING BETTER HAS TO DO WITH THE
519 LANGUAGE. IN RECENT TIMES A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING HAS COME ABOUT OF
520 HEBREW AND ARAMAIC, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE ARCHAEOLOGY FINDS AND EXTEN-
521 SIVE STUDY OF THE ANCIENT LANGUAGES BY LINGUISTS AND EGYPTOLOGISTS.
522 ALSO THE OLDEST COPIES EVER FOUND WERE RECENTLY DICOVERED BETWEEN 1947
523 AND 1955, KNOWN AS THE DEAD SEA SCROLL. I WAS SPECIFICALLY SPEAKING OF
524 TRANSLATIONS AS OPPOSED TO VERSIONS OR PARAPHRASED. THE DIFFERENCE IS
525 THAT A TRANSLATION IS A WORD FOR WORD MEANING, WHEREAS THE OTHERS ARE
526 NOT.
527 THESE OLD SCROLLS FOUND INCLUDE COPIES OF THE HEBREWS SCRIPTURES. THEY 
528 DATE FROM 100 TO 200 YEARS BEFORE CHRIST. ONE OF THE SCROLLS IS A COPY 
529 OF THE BOOK OF ISAIAH. BEFORE THIS WAS FOUND THE OLDEST COPY AVAILABLE
530 WAS MADE NEARLY 1,000 YEARS AFTER JESUS WAS BORN. WHEN THESE TWO WERE 
531 COMPARED THERE WERE ONLY SMALL DIFFERENCES, MOST OF THEM SPELLING.
532 ALSO THERE ARE MORE THAN 1,700 ANCIENT COPIES OF THE VARIOUS PORTIONS
533 OF THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES AVAILABLE. BY CAREFULLY COMPARING THESE MANY
534 OLD COPIES, EVEN THE FEW MISTAKES COPYISTS MADE CAN BE FOUND AND COR-
535 RECTED. ALSO THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OLD COPIES OF THE GREEK THAT HAVE
536 BEEN COMPARED AND RECOMPARED. BUT MOSTLY IN THE LAST 100 YEARS. SO
537 THAT WAS WHY I SAID THAT A NEWER TRANSLATION WAS BETTER, IN THAT
538 THE LANGUAGE IS UNDERSTOOD MORE ACCURATELY NOW. BESIDES WE DON'T
539 USE THE SAME TYPE OF ENGLISH WHICH WAS POPULAR IN THE 16,17, OR 1800'S
540 ANYMORE. SOME WORDS EVEN HAVE OPPOSITE MEANINGS NOW, FROM THEIR EARLIER
541 COUNTERPARTS.
542 JONATHAN CHANCE: YOUR SUGGESTION SOUNDS LIKE THE REAL SOLUTION.
543 CYM: WE ALL HAVE A SHOE THAT FITS.
544 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?DEBORAH?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
545 	As for the numbers, I didn't say that they didn't have words for large 
546 numbers. I said that the largest NAMED number was "thousand". Ten thousand
547 (and hundred thousand, etc) are shortened forms of "ten thousands", or 
548 "one hundred thousands", NOT individually named numbers. Also, if you have a
549 source for that statement about "using the numbers over again", I would be 
550 VERY interested in it. Remember, ALL ancient numbering systems (except Mayan
551 and the rather late Arabic system) were not positional systems. Rather, they
552 were systems like Roman numerals, having a seperate symbol for 1, 10, 100
553 and so forth. An article in the current Scientific American even notes that 
554 some even used the SAME symbol to mean different numbers at different times.

557      The Inspector was just about to leave the sleazy bar when a delicate
558 hand clasped him by the shoulder.  Serena sat down at the table next to
559 him, slightly out of breasts.
560      "Salizar." She looked into his eyes.  "I'm sorry I'm late again, but
561 I was followed." She took a moment to eye the patrons of the establishment
562 suspiciously. "I think you may be the only one who can help us now."
563      The inspector took another pull from the glass, emptying it.  "I am
564 only a policeman, Serena, and soon I must be on duty.  What can I do?"
565      "McKane has gone totally mad!  He believes he can conquer the world
566 with his plan.  All of us are known to his men, but you...maybe you can
567 infiltrate his organization and finally bring him down.  Ever since the
568 Hari Krishnas bought out his primal belch franchise, he has been a man
569 possessed.  He will kill us all!"
570      The inspector flashed back to that night on the train.  No, he 
571 thought, this was a woman who could not be owned, merely allied for
572 a time.  "What about Sergei?"  He was sorry he'd asked as soon as the
573 words left his mouth.
574      Serena looked away.  "He has disappeared, and Phillipe was found
575 murdered. I am the only one left who has seen McKane's face, and tonight
576 a man was following me.  Of course," she deftly began cleaning a
577 fingernail with a stiletto which seemed to magically appear in her hand,
578 "He will not follow me again."  The old smile passed her face for a moment.
579 "I will be your outside contact.  The Albanians will provide us with all
580 that we need.  One of the Andropov clones from McKane's last bungled
581 operation has become a talk-show host in Albania, and the people are
582 not happy with McKane."
583      He thought for a moment, and then realized that this might be bigger
584 than it sounded, if it matched with what had been happening to him lately,
585 the whispers in the streets.  "When do we leave?"

607 
608 Dear Yassar,
609      I have good news and bad.  We netted over $17 million on the Russian
610 caper with McKane.  As for the Bad... Phillippe is dead and McKane's gone
611 off the deep end.  Primal belch, Krishna's and all that.  McKane's position
612 is threatening  our organization and we will have to take action.
613      Serena has gone to Turkey to enlist Salazar's aid.  I think she also
614 wanted to avoid the sex-crazed platypus, Herman.  His appetite is too much
615 even for the lovely Serena.  They will be heading for India shortly.  Will
616 keep you informed.
