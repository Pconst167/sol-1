49 It was a very funny year, when I was seventeen.
50 Highschool almost over, summer almost on the scene.
51 There were no wars to speak of. No draft to fear that day.
52 Of course there was some fighting, but it was very far away.
53 Secondary school: I was so glad to be done.
54 I knew for sure that summer would mean a bunch of fun.
55 Backwater had just started, back in those bygone days.
56 I remember calling in and printing lines during my stays.
57 It sometimes seems so long ago, that I turned seventeen,
58 But time is very relative, and it passes by unseen.

70 ley about streying s-f fans on shore leave on some immaginary world named Argo
71 as he worked.  Without entirely realizing what he had done or how, he had kludged
72 up an encoding device which he hoped would meet NET standards.
73     Typing on an old keyboard he had found lying around and interfaced to said
74 kludge; what went out 'over the air' was:

83      Immediatly he dissasembled the device, carefully putting each componant 
84 back in it's proper cubby.  If uninvited guests were to arrive unexpectedly,
85 all they would find was the same collec-

87 he now used to assemble a very crude but effective giger counter.
88      Then is was cautiosly back topside with vission almost normal except for
89 a painful 'gritty' sensation and spots heed probably be seeing for days.
90      Well nothing for it but his make-shift 'counter seemed not to be register-
91 ing at all.  No way could he convince himself that the device was indeed func-
92 tioning and the environment was infact 'safe' yet such was the urgancy of his
93 schedualed rendevios that he only hoped his body would remain intact long enough
94 to reach it.  No thare hadn't been any radiation suits among the stores.  Ad-
95 mittedly an odd ommision but then everything had been qurioser and qurioser for
96 quite some time.

99 she had parked herself.
100      He had to remove the engine cover and jumper around the now useless electr-
101 onic ignition to the old regulating reley block that had patiantly sat mounted
102 but disconected the passt 5 or so years.

108   Although I wore the white smock of one that works to preserve
109 lives, I had my ways when preservation required more drastic
110 measures. From under the lab jacket I extracted the butterfly
111 knife in the method known as an ice-pick drop. With speed and
112 practice the click that is made can be the last thing your victim
113 will ever hear. I recalled that the man guarding the room with
114 the two prisoners was right handed, as I, so I reached to
115 cover his mouth with my left hand as my right hand did the task 
116 of opening his throat and neck. I muffled his cry as he dropped
117 to the ground, blood silently oozing down my arm. There's no 
118 hiding that much blood on my jacket, so I would pray that no one
119 else would see me. I reached into the "sleeping" guards pocket to
120 get the keys that would open the door to the poor imprisoned 
121 souls inside. Once the door was opened I dragged what remained of
122 the guard into the room so as not to be seen by anyone that
123 happened to stroll by. I closed the door and locked it from the 
124 inside. After removing the key and dropping it on the body, I 
125 turned to the others in the room. They were neither sleeping nor
126 awake, they had been drugged. I did it. Wiping the blood from my
127 hand I then removed the hypodermic and the antidote from my
128 pocket and prepared them for their departure.
129   "Can you understand me? I am here to help you now." I said as
130 began the injection of the solution to the woman that was seated
131 in front of me. The only response I saw was a slight droop of her
132 head, almost indetectable. As the needle pricked her arm she did
133 not flinch. "Damn!" I thought. "Still no sensation." I finished 
134 with her and proceeded to the man that sat next to her. At the 
135 moment he was equally withdrawn from reality. I prepared a new
136 hypo for his injection. No flinch here either. I would have to 
137 hope that it would begin working soon for time was always crucial
138 when you are out to break the rules of the game on home territory.
139   "W-water.." It was the woman. I think I remembered her name.
140   "No, Pamela. There isn't any water to be had now. You'll have
141 to wait until we are out of here."
142   "N-no.  Last time.. injection.. only water..."  Her words were
143 broken, but it was still a good sign that the antidote to the 
144 drug was taking effect quickly enought.
145   "Yes, you are right. I had hoped you would be able to see what
146 I had done. By only giving you a water injection, the Doctor 
147 wouldn't suspect that I was halting your induced stupor. I'm glad
148 you were able to see that I was helping you then. I can't say as
149 much for your sleepy partner over here, I had to give him the 
150 real thing last time." I began to loosen their bonds. "Soon you
151 should be able to move about on your own, I've given you a stim-
152 ulant that should do the trick at waking you back up." Just then
153 the man next to Pamela began to mumble. I hoped that the antidote
154 would work because I hadn't the time to test its efficiency 
155 before hand. "Primitive resources!" I snorted under my breath.
156 "We'll have to move quickly. Soon they should suspect that things
157 are amiss. In about five minutes you'll have to exit the room by
158 this window behind you. There will be a vehicle waiting to take
159 you off the grounds. I will be driving. But you must hurry."
160   "So.. so tired. Can't go on.."
161   "But you must! You can not stay here or your life will most
162 surely be forfeit. You must snap out of it!" I picked up the keys
163 and unlocked the door. I peered down the hallway -- no one.
164 After heading back to the lab to retrieve a few of the scientific
165 research files, I headed on out for the car that would take us
166 away from all this madness. As I pulled up to the side of the
167 building I noticed a scuffle inside the room. There was a fight
168 inside. The plans for escape looked destroyed until I saw the two
169 figures running in a crooked line from the buildings door.
170   "Over here! Run, Run!" I called. The man, Marvin I believe,
171 started to run in the opposite direction until Pamela stopped him
172 and headed for the car. I helped them into te back seats and
173 proceeded for the air strip. The plane that she had been brought 
174 in on had not yet seen fit to return from whence it came.
175 Feigning injury, I got out of the car and acted as if my arm had
176 beem severly injured. Luckily the man watching the plane believed
177 my little charade and I got within striking distance to relieve 
178 him of his compact machine-gun. Then, barging into the pilot's
179 room I woke up the aviator from his slumber.
180   "I hope you've had enought beauty sleep, 'cause I've got a 
181 mission for you.. Take her back!" I think the weapon in his back
182 made it unnecessary to have a good grip on his collar, but I didn't
183 think I would chance it. We headed out for the plane and once I 
184 made sure he understood what I wanted, I ripped out the radio's
185 wiring and helped Pamela and Marvin on board.
186   Talk about bumpy rides.

190   Once back in the states, I got us a ride on the express train
191 back to Portland, where the whole farce began. During the ride
192 Pamela and Marvin were hardly awake. It seemed that the sedative
193 had actually caught up with them after the test antidote had
194 worn off. It was a good thing, they needed the rest after having
195 been through what they had. The files I had taken along with me
196 were those that had outlined precisely what was planned for
197 Pamela once apprehended. I had sat and translated as much of the
198 non-technical transcripts from German into English as possible
199 without including too much jargon that would make its meaning
200 vague or ambiguous. After reading the first couple of
201 paragraphs it was evident what the Doctor had in mind. I would
202 leave these transcripts with Pamela in order that she may under-
203 stand just what I had taken her away from. I wanted nothing to do
204 with the horrid plans I now translated for I too was a doctor. 
205 A sane one though.
206   As we reached Portland, Pamela was beginning to come around 
207 from the effects of the drug. I slipped her both copies of the
208 transcripts and tried to explain to her that I would meet her
209 shortly at one of the more notable buildings that the city had in
210 its downtown area.
211   "I shall meet you there in three hours. If I don't make it by
212 then, take the tickets in this envelop and hide until you are 
213 fully recovered. You'll understand." I helped them both into an
214 awaiting taxi and saw them off from the station. They were gone.
215 All I had to do now was contact the appropriate authorities and
216 maybe something more could be done about this whole nightmare.
217   All there was that surrounded me was the sound of the idle
218 engines, their steam blowing effortlessly into the late afternoon
219 sky. The din of the travellers could not be heard as no one would
220 be coming or going for another good fifteen minutes or so. I stood
221 alone in the gravel, alone on the tracks.
222   Just then, from behind, there came a strong arm that reached
223 and grabbed at me.. I could not escape or even move at all.
224   "Zee Doktor is dissssspleased vith you, Paul.  You should never
225 have done zose things vith the prisonersssss." His grip tightened.
226   "<Ack>.. <Grap>.. <Guurgle>.." I couldn't say a word.
227   "Zee Doktor vould like me to preform one lassst operation vith
228 you Paul. Gute Nacht." I felt the edge of the knife draw across
229 my open neck.

248 *@*@*@* A bedraggled minstrel @*@*@*@*@
249 One day the army of Strrolodor,
250 set out on a journey to even the score,
251 A demon, evil had killed their king,
252 this monster was a terrible thing,
253 to see.
254 1,000,000 teeth all in a row,
255 hands with claws,
256 that could destroy mountains with a single blow,
257 claws of ivory,
258 eyes of fire,
259 hair all mangled,
260 like some barbed wire,
261 a trillion men,
262 fell under his might,
263 without even,
264 putting up a fight.
265 Oh yes it was an ugly monster,
266 standing there,
267 there was no question of that,
268 Like the Medusa,
269 of Greek tales,
270 It turned men to stone with a single stare,
271 The army's approach,
272 was simple and good,
273 And as they approached,
274 the demon stood,
275 And laughed at their feeble force.
276 It rose a fist,
277 into the air,
278 then sgung it down,
279 witx an evil glare,
280 the 100 men,
281 who were under it,
282 died without a txought,
283 killed too soon,
284 They hurled their spears,
285 to no avail,
286 for it was like shooting petllets,
287 at a giant whale.
288 They knew they were finished,
289 but their leader would not,
290 give up that easily,
291 this day.
292 Hindered and broken,
293 his men all retreated,
294 he stayed there,
295 by the demon and his club,
296 trying to figure out a way,
297  destroy this monster.
298 "This creature must not live another day" 
299 he said. And he thought away.
300      
301 An Idea formed,
302 in his head,
303 He'd stop that creature,
304  Or xe'd be dead.
305  
306 "Oh foul demon"
307 "trouble us no more"
308 return from whence you came"
309 "you've caus
310 and Pain!"
311 "I challenge you demon"
312 "To a fair duel"
313 "If you can't answer a question I win"
314 Txe demon paused and thought.
315 It's mind wheeled and raced.
316 "I ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE" it said,
317 with a grin.
318 Now the demon was all-knowing,
319 or so his black eheart thought,
320 But for all the questions he could answer,
321 ere was one that he could not.
322 "Wjahat is true love?" asked the knight,
323 his brow wet with sweat.
324 The demon gasped,
325 then snorted in rage,
326 It said "I should have not let"
327 you ask me that!"
328  
329 "The cxallenge is done, oh demon"
330 "The results are clear and true"
331 "The winnder of this challenge"
332 "Is me and not you"
333 The demon knew when he'd been beat,
334 and silentltyly drooped xis head,
335 then suddenly and quite swiftly,
336 the demon fell to the ground,
337 cold dead?
338 The demon paid the price of defeat,
339 At txe hands of that brave knight.
340 He's still alive,
341 for justice and truth,
342 He still carries on the fight.

357 Boy oh boy has this been a good 30 minutes' reading!!  Poems, insecurity,
358 controversy,NET-style stories, Banned from Argo, and Wierd Al ... all on two
359 disks!
360      Minstrel: I have watched your poetry with great intrest, since in another
361 reality I too am a Minstrel. (At OSU we have a VERY involved D&D game going--
362 in fact, this summer I have an assignment from my DM, if you believe it - my
363 character's journal, due Oct. 1)  I also feel for the fact that you desperately
364 want comments on your work.  I have also gone thru that: I entered a few things
365 during Christmas break and then sat here and prayed for any comments at all.
366 I did get a 'nice poem' from Mikey, but no one else even noticed...in print.
367 One of the things that I've learned on Backwater is that if no one says any-
368 thing, then they liked it.  If they didn't then they would type in som con-
369 structive criticism for you.  My only critical comment is that all those 
370 commas are making my English major's eyes seasick...you only need them where
371 you would put them in a normal sentence.  Same with the quotes.
372 I hereby promise to quit wavering around and to enter some of my stuff before 
373 the end of the week.  I've promised but not delivered for too long...and my
374 minstrel, Mallyn, needs the exercise!!
375                                       Until Later,

381 
382 What is this thing that is more than like?
383 Like is with an acquaintance, a friend barely known.
384 What is this emotion that is more than attraction?
385 Attraction is a force like the earth and the moon,
386 Gravity, cold, it is not enough.
387 
388 What makes a person think of another, day and
389 night with hardly a recess?
390 What makes the mind concentrate with such vigor,
391 That all else seems peripheral and unimportant?
392 
393 What turns the soul into a burning inferno,
394 Hot with the feelings that can never be said?
395 What makes a man crazy; forgets all his duties,
396 Sending logic and reason far far away?
397 
398 What assails my spine, making me into jelly?
399 What tortures my heart as it rips through my body?
400 What changes my outlook on all of the world,
401 Causing me to rethink my place on the scene?
402 
403 I think I might know it, but I'm afraid to admit it.
404 I tarry because of the problems it brings.
405 My heart knows the truth, and it can't be kept silent,
406 But I know when it speaks that my life will be through.

409 
410 Minstrel:  What do you mean the lonely king doesn't lend itself to poetry?
411 What happened to introspection?  Looking inside an emotionally scarred character
412 is the stuff of great poetry.  What you mean is that the lonely king doesn't
413 lend itself to YOUR poetry, which seems to restrict itself to steady action
414 scenes.  You should expand yourself -- look inside the characters and let us
415 know what they're feeling (and why they're feeling it).  I'm now intentionally
416 being mean here.  You PLEADED for suggestions.  If you can take criticism then
417 you'll learn something hfrom this rather than become bitter because of it.

461 Mikey: No new COPYLINK news to report. I have tried out all of the terminal
462  emulations and have encountered no problems. I would like to ask a few
463  questions though. When would be a good time to drop by US Digital? I can
464  also bring new compiled versions of all the game programs and DOC files.
465 TIN MAN: On re-reading...Good stuff. I wish I had looked closer the first
466  time. Thanks.
467 Luingil: Welcome back to the shores of backwater.
468 Kosta: How goes the story creation. We are all waiting to hear from Ms. Lamb.

472         "Ach, another letter.  These things,"  The Sage paused, to scratch
473 neck, "These things gather in circles around my desk like vultures waiting
474 for me to answer them.  Evil scavengers, letters, evil scavengers."

475         Seeing that the Sage was obviously babbling idioticly, the Odd One
476 began to play with some of the folders that made up the Sage's letter file
477 and noticed one in particular.
478         It was on a nice hammermill paper, and done in a fine, precise and
479 carefull handwriting.   It simply asked,  "What poem should I write next?"
480 
        Being able to think of nothing other than a girl he had seen that
481 day, the Odd One wrote underneath that,  "Write about the wink  of a young
482 girl's eye."

492 i traveled with my father
493 when i was very young
494 he was a poem writer
495 a tale teller
496 and many songs had he sung
497 
498 we had no horse or pony
499 we traveled on our feet
500 father in front
501 me close behind
502 often sleeping in the street
503 
504 we carried all we'd ever had
505 in a large gray canvas sack
506 but large smiles
507 and easy laughter
508 were things we never lacked
509 
510 he always spoke the sweetest verse
511 or sang the bawdiest song
512 or spun a tale
513 of noble deeds
514 a right winning over wrong
515 
516 but my favorite story my father did
517 was one he didn't sing
518 he'd set aside 
519 his insturment
520 and tell the tale of the lonely king

524 Apoliges to all. My work is not good and I should restrict it to myself.
525 I won't write any more poetry here. Not untill it is ten thousand times better. 
526 *sniff* Well, Mabye one poem, that I wrote a loooooong time ago. Be back after I dig it up.

531 By The Minstre:l
532 Dinosaurs and a child's mind,
533 strange things there do form,
534 monsters, spaceships, time after time,
535 Anything out of the norm.
536  
537 Dinosaurs and A child's mind,
538 thought churn and twist, they reel and spin,
539 Wizards, dragons, gnomes and trolls,
540 swords and stones come to life therein,
541  
542 Dinosaurs and a cxild's mind,
543 the towo go together hand in hand,
544 but when you grow up and you face the t"true" world,
545 You leave them behind, in a distant land.

547 --P--
548     To the Minstrel, and all his voices: don't give up my good man.   Join the 
549 ranks of those that visit here often, and watch and learn.   Do not take there
550 words harshly, but let them let you look at your work in a new light.   I came
551 across a little fact the other day about what % of a writers time is
552 devoted to which task.   60% is spent in revision.
553     You are leaps and bounds above many already.   You have a desire to write,
554 and the perfect place to come to to learn how and to present your works for 
555 input.

580 Sage: Odd one? Hmmmmm.
581 Cistop Mike: Does Backw`ter have a "theme"?  What I mean is,  TANIS 
582 (the board) is a desert city, Alternate World is a planet with a cchurch 
583 and what of Backwater? 
584 Here is my suggestion for a theme.
585 5%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%**%*%*%*
586      Long ago, the Pirates of the olden days created a place where they 
587 could go. To tell of their plunder and wht they had done. To tell others 
588 of their journeys and tales. but most of all, to hide maps and treasures 
589 in a great waterway. T
590       This waterway streached nearly across the island. It('s coves 
591 filled with the btreasures of pirates. This place was named "BACKWATER"."
592 If you go there today, you will still find tadventurers, singers, tellers
593 and speakers. They tell tales, talk, 
594 laugh, cry, and love. 
595        The spirits are, like the treasure, the Pirate's. If you listen 
596 closely, you might hear them talking to themselves, and looking on at 
597 the people who enter into BACKWATER.! For it truely IS a place of wonder.
598 %*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%
599 Well? What do you think? Is that a goosd idea for a "theme"?????
600 %*%*%*%*%*MUDGE THE OTTER*%*%*%*%*%*%*%
601 *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*
602 Mudge:  Backwater does have a theme, one that has developed over a period of a
603 few years.  Backwater is an Inn, in a world/place known as Inisfail.  But then,
604 perhaps a story along those lines on another disk would better serve the telling
605 of the tale.
