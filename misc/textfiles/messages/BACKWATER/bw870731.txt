 27 	"Once inside the ether whirlpool, I could do nothing but hold on
 28 and hope the spinning would end.  The current swept past, trying to claw
 29 me away from the relative safety of the tiller.  Morwin was nowhere
 30 in sight.
 31 	"The turbulence got worse.  The ether drove the Razor's Edge about
 32 like a cork, directing the ship this way and that before choosing a third
 33 direction- straight toward a peculiar twist of dimension known as a
 34 Convolution.
 35 	"A Convolution is extremely rare.  It is a pathway between points
 36 existing in six dimensions: a direct link between worlds, times, and planes
 37 of existence.  Milchar had once had a harrowing experience involving one of
 38 those things, and had not hesitated to relate the tale to me as an example
 39 of what Travelcraft could do.  The raw energy required to create and
 40 maintain such a gateway was best described as colossal, he said. The fury
 41 of the Ether Eddy sweeping the planes spent itself rapidly as it was
 42 consumed by the Convolution.  Gigantic bolts of energy flew about the craft
 43 as it plunged into elsewhere.  An instant before the ship disappeared
 44 entirely, a rapid burst caught the mast, which just as rapidly experienced
 45 complete existence failure.
 46 	"I must admit I was stunned by the view.  The Razor flew through
 47 a tunnel of rainbow colors, which swirled as the ether itself did.
 48 There was this terrible impression of *SPEED*, and it increased by the
 49 second.  I was certain that if I stopped to think about it, I'd have been
 50 terrified right then.
 51 	"Half a minute later, the Razor burst out into normal space, about
 52 fifty feet above a beach.  After the 'landing', I picked myself up and
 53 surveyed the damage.  She'll never sail again, unless she's brought into a
 54 port for repairs.  I collected what I thought I'd need, and hid the rest,"
 55 Grann paused, "in a little pocket dimension I know about.  I walked along
 56 the beach until I arrived here."
 57 	The proprietor of the Playful Porpoise looked thoughtful.  "And
 58 you say you haven't seen a soul since?  Not even that Morwin character?
 59 Why haven't you just popped home like you did to escape Morwin when you
 60 met him, eh?"
 61 	Grann looked sheepish.  "I can't.  I'm just an apprentice mage of
 62 Travelcraft.  I need to know where I am before I can 'pop' someplace else.
 63 I don't know what world, line, time, or dimension I'm in."
 64 	Juril Hill-Mover, the proprietor, was quiet again.  Grann again
 65 looked as his benefactor, noting the large frame, green eyes, and most
 66 especially the flame red hair topping themuscled giant.  Juril moved with
 67 a cat-like grace.  Perhaps this had something to do with the well-behaved
 68 nature of his customers.
 69 	"I see all types of folks in here, Grann."  Grann could see that,
 70 noticing that a seven-tentacled customer gibbered at a seven-foot
 71 brown-furred giant drinking a grey muck nearby.  "I'll quote one of my
 72 steady patrons, flies here regularly in a big metal bird- 'Trust your
 73 feelings'."
 74 	"Who says that?"
 75 	"Can't rightly remember his name- Skystepper, or something like
 76 that.  Listen, you said you could feel something before that storm came up.
 77 I put a lot of stock in gut feelings.  What was it like?"
 78 	Grann thought about that for a minute.
 79 	"Like Milchar staring over my shoulder."

247  
248 To I.G.:
249  
250      The world can indeed be a cold and lonely place.  It is true
251 that many appalling things happen.  When faced by these facts, it
252 is understandable that one might adopt a Determinist position
253 ("What is going to happen, will happen.") because such a belief
254 makes it easier to cope.
255      While such a view may be psychologically comforting in some
256 respects, I believe it is inaccurate and, in the long run, harmful
257 to both the individual and society.  The individual does not have
258 control over everything (and, more often than not, most things),
259 and it is therefore easy to make the generalization that he/she has
260 no control at all.  This view is compelling because it provides a
261 "rational" explanation of why some things happen despite one's
262 efforts, and allows one to take a "objective" position on these
263 events.  If an individual believes that his/her actions have no
264 effect, then they will not feel guilty at not reacting to these
265 situations.
266      The Determinist world-view is harmful to the individual
267 because it promotes a feeling of helplessness, and because it
268 encourages apathy.  If one thinks that his/her actions are
269 meaningless, then he/she will tend to avoid trying to change things
270 within his/her life because, in Determinist theory, it is not
271 within his/her power to change them.  The Determinist world-view is
272 harmful to society because citizens who are Determinists will not
273 bother to try to improve and/or regulate it.  Witness the fact that
274 less than half of the American public votes because they feel that
275 it "won't make any difference", and the number of people who accept
276 corrupt politicians and government officials because they don't
277 think there is anything they can do.
278      There are many aspects of the world that are hard to change,
279 and it is true that the actions of one individual can seldom exert
280 much influence over them.  But that does not mean that the
281 individual is powerless.  The key to influencing major events is to
282 work together with other individuals for change.  One drop of water
283 is nothing by itself, but many together form tidal waves.

479 To the anonymous person who commented on my Determinism entry:
480  
481      While it may have sounded like a "textbook opinion" (and I'm
482 not sure what you mean by that term), the ideas presented were my
483 own and were not taken from a textbook.  Most textbooks on the
484 subject of Determinism focus on the associated metaphysical and
485 logical problems, not the social implications.

523  
524 Dear son:
525  
526 Just a few lines to let you know that
527 I'm still alive.  I'm writing this
528 letter slowly, because I know you
529 cannot read fast.  You won't know the
530 house when you come home - we've moved.
531  
532 About your father - he has a lovely new
533 job.  He has 500 men under him.  He is
534 cutting the grass at the cemetery.
535  
536 There was a washing machine in the new
537 house when we moved in, but it isn't
538 working very good.  Last week I put 14
539 shirts into it, pulled the chain, and I
540 haven't seen the shirts since.
541  
542 Your sister Mary had a baby this
543 morning.  I haven't found out whether
544 it's a boy or a girl, so I don't know
545 if you are an Aunt or Uncle.
546  
547 Your Uncle Dick drowned last week in a
548 vat of whiskey in the Dublin Brewery.
549 Some of his workmates dived in to save
550 him, but he fought them off bravely.
551 We cremated his body and it took three
552 days to put out the fire.
553  
554 Your father didn't have much to drink
555 at Christmas.  I put a bottle of Castor
556 Oil in his pint of beer - it kept him
557 going til New Year's Day.  I went to
558 the doctor on Thursday and your father
559 came with me.  The doctor put a small
560 tube into my mouth and told me to keep
561 it shut for 10 minutes.  Your father
562 offered to buy it from him.
563  
564 It only rained twice last week.  First
565 for 3 days, and then for 4 days.
566 Monday it was so windy that one of our
567 chickens laid the same egg four times.
568  
569 We had a letter yesterday from the
570 undertaker.  He said if the last
571 installment wasn't paid on your
572 grandmother within 5 days, up she
573 comes.
574  
575  
576                  Your loving mother,
577  
578  
579 P.S. I was going to send you $10.00,
580 but I had already sealed the envelope.

642 If you truely belive in fatalism then indeed there is no need to 
643 be responsible. Since the very nature of that belief says that it doesn't
644 matter what you do life will go on about you in a predefined fashion.
645 So you could kill someone, and if you are predestined to not go to jail
646 you won't, and if you are predestined to go to jail it doesn't mater
647 if you kill anyone or not. Fatalism is usally used as an excuse for
648 not being responsible to yourself. Why strive to better yourself
649 when it won't make any difference.

679 THERE WAS A SECRET MEETING A FEW WEEKS AGO BETWEEN ROBERT
680 MCFARLANE AND THE AYATOLLAH, WHICH TOOK PLACE HERE IN AMERICA.
681 DURING THE MEETING, THE AYATOLLAH INQUIRED ABOUT A RED TELEPHONE
682 THE MCFARLANE ALWAYS KEPT IN HIS BRIEFCASE.
683 MCFARLANE REPLIED, "WITH THIS PHONE, I CAN CALL ANYONE IN THE
684 ENTIRE WORLD. I CAN EVEN TALK TO THE DEVIL"
685 HE PROVED THIS BY TAPPING OUT A FEW DIGITS ON THE KEYPAD, AND
686 THEN HANDING THE PHONE OVER TO THE SKEPTICAL KHOMENI.
687 MUCH TO THE AYATOLLAH'S SUPRISE, IT WAS IN FACT THE DEVIL ON THE
688 LINE. THEY TALKED FOR A FEW MINUTES, AND AT THE END OF THE
689 CONVERSATION, AN OPERATOR CAME ON THE LINE AND SAID, "THAT WILL
690 BE TWENTY DOLLARS, PLEASE."
691 AYATOLLAH ASKED MCFARLANE IF IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR SUCH A PHONE
692 TO BE INSTALLED IN TEHRAN. ROBERT SAID HE WOULD LOOK INTO IT.
693 A FEW WEEKS LATER, THE AYATOLLAH HAD HIS OWN PHONE. THE FIRST
694 THING HE DID WAS CALL THE DEVIL AGAIN AND TALK TO HIM. THEY
695 CONVERSED FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR, AND AT THE END OF THAT TIME, AN
696 OPERATOR CAME ON THE LINE AND SAID, "THAT WILL BE SEVENTY CENTS,
697 PLEASE."
698 PUZZLED, THE AYATOLLAH ASKED THE OPERATOR WHY IT WAS SO CHEAP.

737  
738                             Prolog
739      Those who say that beacuse evil exists in this world we
740 must continue to perpetuate its existance have never made a
741 great deal of sense to me.  Of course these are never thair ac-
742 tual words.  What they are actualy doing, in many cases quite
743 blatently is trying to excuse thair not giving a damb as to
744 consiquencees of thair actions as long as some aggrandisement
745 even immaginary, accrues to
746 themselves.
747      Yet there is more to the universe than empowered pettiness.
748 Far more.  Evil can no more halt the turning of the seasons
749 then can good.  A season of seasons is ending.
750      Even as the blight, at this, its end, curls inword upon
751 itself, the springtime of hope opens wider, encompassing all
752 with the pure verdure of renewall.
753      Through peacefull breeze stirred pine scented mountains
754 the intimaly scaled hydro-solar powered railwayss will yet wind
755 thair sensous nearly silent way from village to village.
756      Once more will a person be free to walk in intimate
757 harmony with his or her inner spirit.  Once more will the wild
758 things walk boldly as companions, at peace, fearing not thair
759 sentient brethren.
760      We inturn will come to know the freedom of truth, secure
761 in the dignity that is universal right.
762      The last of the nine hells is drawing to a close.  The
763 first of the thirteen heavens is about to dawn.
764      Lananara is another world of another sun in another galaxy.
765 It is also a spirit and the symbol of a spirit.  It bears little
766 resemblance to any of the socio-politico-economic systems of
767 this world's past, far less than the most divergent of these
768 bear to one another.
769      I will sit under a tree, a lananaran tree, yet here on 
770 this earth.  Ffor a moment in two places at once, if only in
771 spirit.
772      I will detatch myself from the bitter bile of frustrations.
773      I will sing to the spirit of harmonic convirgance.

813 the evening before.  The first meal of the day is the largest,
814 most eelaborate and most important.  Iit clears the head and 
815 enables one to deal wisely with whatever may befall.
816      The spirit is not nourished by remaining in one place.
817      I tread the familiar path, notebook in hand, through
818 gardens and woods, pea gravel crunching under foot.  Ttrails lead
819 off to other shelters and constructions where people live, at
820 peace; some more, soome less.
821      A kitterfly 'lights on a nearby limb, its wings a blaze of
822 color.
823      In the underbrush a navajali paces me, cautios preditor.
824 i wonder if its friend or strainger.
825      Beside narrow rails a waiting shelter.  It is the goal of
826 this path.  a keypad provided permits anouncement of presence
827 and destination.  i sip steaming lubintao elixer from a mechine

834 And good to have you back. I like your writting style and content.
835 You have a good grasp of what to say and how. An occasional error
836 I don't normally take much notice. I guess the main reason I complained
837 about the errors is that the story is good and the errors were 
838 inhibiting me from enjoying it because I couldn't get into the 
839 story. I was spending most of my time trying to figure out what you
840 ment the words to be. Your last entry is much better, though there
841 are still a few typos and spelling errors. Even spelling errors I
842 don't mind if the spelling is such that the word is recognizable.
843 Obviously I am not one to talk since my spelling and grammer are
844 not the best. Though the worst of it is my paragraph and sentance
845 structure which I need to work on. I think it is a result of my
846 writting style..a direct path from brain to fingers. I then edit 
847 later, though when I enter on line there isn't any easy way to
848 edit, so it ends up in one big monolythic block.. like now...

902     Through the halls of stately giants, green furred with life,
903 twinned river of frozen metal wends its unassuming way, at one

906 Brooks, tame for now, gurggle to themselves conspiritorily

916      "Now there's a sight for sore eyes!" said Jenor as soon as
917 he spotted his friend Delshig.
918      "Me or the gifts I bear?" Delshig responded to the familiar
919 voice.
920      "What took so blessid long?  I'd a' swore you were due a
921 hexichron ago."
922      "What's the big rush?  Yyou sound as if you expected to lift
923 ship before the end of the week."
924      Of course there was no way he reveal the simple fact.  It
925 would indeed lift before the end of the week, before the end of
926 the next day!  Not Delshig, not Vanthur, not even beloved Aluthi
927 could he tell.  The spacer ticket waas formality.  Mmostly form-
928 ality; also protective coloration.  The secrecy was all too real.
929      "It wasn't the first time he'd made discreete inquiries for
930 one low council or another, just the first time He'd be doing so
931 off world.  He'd have to make the roll of spacer look real, his
932 life might depend upon it.  Nothing fancy, just a green hand with
933 a shiney new ticket.  His qualifications were real enough.  He 
934 could have put in for spacer status any time since his pujush.
935 He had become a ferret instead.  If he ever decided to retire 
936 from that business he could 
937 always work the warp roads for real.  Now.
938      Captain Lisho could have faked up a ticket, worked him in,
939 he felt better this way though.

943 He was dreaming again. No great suprise that, he dreamed all the time now.
944 Every day was spent walking from place to place in search of work, money,
945 and food and every night walking robed through endless foggy worlds. He
946 wore the same sandals twenty-four hours a day.
947  
948 Back when it'd started, it seemed so simple; he'd just had an unusual dream.
949 But he couldn't put the dream down. The voice that'd called him that first
950 night still rang tantalizingly at the edge of hearing, still urged him forward
951 every night. The obsession of his nights began to spill into his sunlit life,
952 as he put all his attention into his search for the rowan. He'd lost his
953 dishwashing job when he started sleeping in a city park, hoping that he'd
954 find the rowan he sought. His boss hadn't liked his dishwasher coming in
955 late and covered with dirt.
956  
957 Now he spent his days looking for work, collecting unemployment, doing odd
958 jobs, and seeking. Mostly seeking. He'd sit at home with Helen across his
959 lap, studying books on botany, physics, meditation, and magic. He fasted.
960 Mostly, he dreamed. Waking or sleeping, he always seemed to dream.
961  
962 This dream was more compelling than most. There was a tall figure standing in
963 the mists, and the ground below was glowing; otherwise all was dark. The
964 huge shape spoke in an unknown tongue, and vanished, leaving him alone before
965 the glowing spot in the woods. Then the first light of dawn came, and he saw
966 where he was, and knew the place. It was in a hollow nearby, on the grounds
967 of a local college.
968  
969 His new direction set, he woke, gathered Helen in his arms, and left for the
970 hollow.

972 Oops, I dropped my nail file. Silly me. Now, what shall I put on
973 this adorable little screen, for all my avid fans to read? I
974 have it!!!!! (Any of you out there who are Jewish, either don't
975 read this, or don't be offended.) How can you tell when a Jew-
976 ish girl (like Ma Ahnand Sheela) hits orgasm? She drops her nail
977 file. Yeah, so, it was stupid, but I couldn't think of what to
978 write!!!

984 He look up and wonder why everbody was so happy he made it thought high school
985 He often thought that the hardest grade was the eight one.  The one when he
986 discovered his body was changing.  Hair was starting the grow in different
987 places.  His voice started to change sometimes low and at the most embaresing
988 times high.  All the time he thought about the sex education class his mother
989 made him go to.  He saw all the pictures and listen to the priest tell him 
990 about reproduction.  That day he went home and look long and hard at himself 
991 in the mirror.  Things are changing I really don't know what to do with my body
992 now.  The priest told me never to touch myself but it feels so good.  He said
993 I'd go to hell.  So he spend days in feel of dying and going to hell.  On 
994 fridays he feel better because he got to go to confession and tell God he was
995 sorry but this didn't last long.  That night like all nights he just had to 
996 feel himself.
