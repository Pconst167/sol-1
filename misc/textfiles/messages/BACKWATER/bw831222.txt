28 That train analogy reminds me of an old joke:
29 Adult to Kid:What if you saw two trains heading for each other at
30 70 Mph on the same track?
31 Kid to Adult:I'd jump, yell, scream, and wave my hands to try to
32 get their attention so they'd stop the train.
33 AtK:But what if that didn't work?
34 KtA:I'd get my older brother Joe.
35 AtK:What could he do?
36 KtAOh, nothing, but he's always wanted to see a train
37 wreck.

40 Greetings and salutations again.  This is the real Merlyn (a.k.a.
41 Merlyn #2, a title I hope will disappear in time).  The train analogy
42 ends at the point that you start discussing the size or direction
43 of track.  I have discovered that (believe it or not) when one drops
44 ones need to be right about a subject, THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE
45 EVENTUAL OUTCOME CAN BE "WRONG!".  Fundamental metaphysics here.
46 Also an important point.  The person that talked about "the right
47 gauge track" or "leading to the proper destination" only elevated
48 the problem to a new one of right vs. wrong.  Right and wrong
49 are merely an illusion... a comparison of HERE and NOW to some
50 previously formed picture, thought, or pattern.  THERE IS NOTHING
51 BUT HERE AND NOW.  Everything else is a lie, a hallucination
52 made up by the observer to justify a particular behavior.
53 Life wants to work... we merely stand in its way by being
54 stuck with an old belief.  Please notice that.  It's true for
55 you, for me, for all participants in the game.  Nobody has
56 a real, inherent, right way of doing things.  Everything is made
57 up from events from the past.  Look!  Listen!  Feel it!  The message
58 has always been there.  Listen to "Grand Illusion" by Styx from
59 a while back.  They had to have had a fairly accurate observation
60 of this universe to write that song.  Merlyn of old did too.  He
61 had to, to perform his miracles.  Einstein was a modern Merlyn,
62 in a sense, 'cause he had vision to see things that the rest
63 of the world didn't yet.  He saw the splendid order of the universe,
64 and tried to bring the message back into a world of newtonian
65 physics (definitely a hard job).  My thoughts are running wild now,
66 I'll go back to my point.  Operating within a point-of-view is
67 futile.  All possible thoughts are shaped by the box in which
68 you must think in order to maintain that point of view.  In math,
69 it's the same as solving a system of equations with one too many
70 unknown variables... no matter how many contortions you do, the
71 variable just keeps showing up, and the problem can never be solved.
72 I'm here for no particular purpose at all, but to describe things
73 that are as obvious to me as the sky above and the ground below
74 is to you.  Ask to get answers, but remember that all statements
75 (including this one) are lies.  Don't BELIEVE ANYTHING I SAY!
76 Look for yourself, and see if what I SAY IS TRUE!
77 Enough.  Time for a viewpoint (it'll probably be on "illusions
78 of reality").

130 ALRIGHT. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. I AM THE FIRST MERLYN TO USE THIS SYSTEM
131 THE FIRST MERLYN TO USE THIS DISK IS MY TEACHER AND THE ORIGIONAL.
132 BUT I AM THE FIRST AND WISH TO REMAIN IT. TO MERLYN #3: FIND ANOTHER ALIAS. 
133 MY GRIPE IF YOU WOULD NOTICE IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T USE THIER IMAGINATIONS
134 ENOUGH. BEING THE 3RD IN A LINE OF METAPHYSICAL MERLYNS IS HARDLY A
135 POSSITION YOU WILL PROPHIT FROM. TO THE MERLYN WHO USED THIS DISK FIRST:
136 IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE MERLYN TOO WE BETTER FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. WE
137 CAN WORK ON IT SUNDAY AT THE PARTY OK? I AM NOT A HORSE!!!!!! I WILL GET YOU
138 FOR THAT MY FRIEND.  DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL SYSTEM OF BODIES
139 WITHOUT MINDS (NO ONE NEEDS ONE ANYWAY RIGHT?)? I THUNKS ME DID.
140 WHO EVER SAID THE KNOW ME IS PROBABLY FULL OF IT. UNLESS THEY WERE TALKING 
141 ABOUT MY TEACHER. (CANT SAY HIS NAME) I AM UNKNOWN BY MANY BUT KNOWN
142 RYWHERE. 
143 TO MY TEACHER (ONCE AGAIN): IF YOU ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO USE MERLYN HOW 
144 ABOUT IF YOU MAKE A COMPROMISE SOMEWHERE. WE MAKE A COMPROMISE THAT IS. THAT
145 IS MY REQUEST.      GRANTED???

148 Leonard...button, button, who's got the button??? How is the you-know-
149 what going? Finished yet?
150 To Aaron...Discussion of major computer networks in this forum is a bad
151 idea. The 'U' is a good place to meet. The lounge is good also. We can
152 arrange times when stuff starts up again.
153 To the person who keeps refering to 'College kids' in a derogatory manner,
154 Why must you do things like that? Some of us 'College kids' don't appreciate
155 such comments. I personally don't leave 150 line
156 frech poems and such, but even if I did I don't think more space needs to
157 be wasted with your griping about it. I could say alot more, but I don't
158 really want to waste space on the subject, but I will use just enough to
159 let you know how I feel.
160 To Hrothgar...Here here on Rich's Cigar Store! I have never seen such a
161 good selection of magazines! I too occasionally buy foreign magazines, and
162 I totally  agree with your opinion on the subject. Many things are written
163 in those magazines that you would never see in the likes of Time, Newsweek,
164 or shudder, the National Enquirer! Way to spread the word!

167 The E.P.A. today reported a new threat to the climate, 
168 called the "Whitehouse effect", which is producing
169 overheated air masses, melting principles, and rapidly

171 the uncontrolled yearning of fossil fools for higher

177 dROPPed bIT: i don't think the remark to "college kids" applied to
178 you, he was just blown away over the little bit of imitation 
179 philosophy about the unknowable universe. Those of us who think,
180 ore who merely read a little went through that phase too. I think i
181 was in about 8th grade when i passed beyond it (or was it 6th??)
182 #3, if that is where you are at, come back in about 6 months, even you 
183 may grow up. Or else validate your claim. Most of us have found out that

192 Greetings and salutations (Unnecessary by now, I assume, but still
193 a polite way to enter the conversation.) I DO NOT suggest that
194 you, as interested parties in the continuance of the game simply
195 sit by the sideline, but you may be spending more of your efforts
196 convincing and conning the "opposing" sid than you are solving the
197 problem.  That may not be accurate either... remember that everything
198 that I say is a lie.  Some have referred to me as "#3", I dunno
199 how I got that title.  As far as I can perceive, I am only number
200 two, and the one that "IS NOT A HORSE" is number 1, my student.
201 I know nothing but what is immediately before me.  I also know that
202 the world will not exist as we know it today by the end of this century.
203 It is time for the game to take a turn.  It is the ending of the 
204 current phase, and a beginning of the new one.  At the end of this
205 phase, all survivors on the planet will realize that their brother
206 is not a separate creature, but merely an extension of themselves.
207 People are beginning to notice this already.  Hooray for the good
208 side of the force!  I come only to point the way.  It is simple, and
209 you notice it from time to time already.  The question "Why am I
210 alive?" might be a good starting place.  No, I am not trying to
211 be religious... just a little bit of observation is all I ask.
212 What is the purpose of the game (also called "reality")?  What is
213 you and your part in it?  Enough talk... I'll fill up the disk in
214 no time.

217 ****************************************
218 Cute, but pointless. Solipsism is marvelous for philosophical discussions,
219 but the action you called for is not possible from solipsistic thought.
220 And if everything you say is a lie, oh Zen master, why should I pay any
221 attention to you? What is the purpose of the "game"? There is no purpose.
222 At least, none that pre-exists your definition of reality. Any purpose is
223 created by individuals, for their own uses. And what action could one take
224 through this medium? None, of course. You seem to assume that none here
225 take actions outside of this medium, and that is typical of your mode of
226 thought, which is filled with assumptions that you have no way of knowing
227 or proving. As was said above, grow up a little. Sometimes pragmatism is
228 more helpful than philosophy.

236      I wish to apologize for my irresponsible slur 
237      against college students. My comment was 
238      immature and unnecessary. It was inspired by 
239      an unfortunate lapse of judgement brought on 
240      through exhaustion and discouragement. I am sorry.

243 ALL:  Whew!!!!   Too rich for my blood.
244 PAM:  BASBBS is down.  Fried IC.  Glad that you are back, though, and
245       I missed meeting you at the Not a Pizza.  I have some goodies for
246       you, do you have a disc, or are you cassette only ?

248 [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]
249      YES DJJ, I DO HAVE A DISK, AS I LONG AGO GOT TIRED OF "ERROR 143".
250 I WAS WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO BASBBS, I'VE TRIED CALLING IT A FEW TIMES
251 RECENTLY AND GOTTEN NO RESPONSE.  WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT IT ISN'T A
252 PERMANENT THING, EVEN THOUGH HARDWARE PROBLEMS AREN'T THE BEST THINGS IN
253 THE WORLD. AS TO THE NOT A PIZZA, I HAVE A BAD DEFECT IN THAT I'M TERRIBLY
254 CHICKEN ABOUT MEETING PEOPLE.  TOTALLY TERRIFIED!  BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO
255 SEEING YOU UP AND RUNNING AGAIN.
256      I WON'T COMMENT ON MOST OF THE ABOVE, EXCEPT THAT I HOPE THAT EVERYONE
257 WILL CALM DOWN A BIT AND REALIZE THAT, WHILE ALL THIS IS FUN, IT REALLY
258 DOESN'T MATTER.  NOTHING WE SAY HERE WILL CHANGE THE WORLD ONE IOTA, EXCEPT
259 PERHAPS TO GIVE OURSELVES AND OTHERS SOME NEW INSIGHTS INTO OTHER'S VIEW-
260 POINTS.
261      AARON, I AM WAITING WITH BAITED BREATH (UH, BAITED BAUD RATES PERHAPS?)
262 FOR YOUR NEW SYSTEM.  COULD YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE?  DID YOU GET YOUR
263 HARDWARE?  KEEP US INFORMED!
264 [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]PAM.[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]
265 DEAR PAM: VOLKOMEMMON, AND SALUTATIONS. AGREE ON CALMING DOWN. HOWEVER,
266 DISAGREE THAT THIS MEDIUM DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THINGS.
267 AN EXAMPLE: THE CURRENT HEAD OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE REAGAN ADMINIS-
268 TRATION WAS ON 'FREEMAN REPORTS' LAST NIGHT. THE SUBJECT WAS THE 
269 RELATIONSHIP OF THE PRESS AND THE GOVERNMENT. HE DENIED THAT THE PRESS
270 WAS UNDER ATTACK BY THE ADMINISTRATION. THEN THEY GOT INTO DISCUSSING
271 HIS RESIGNATION. HIS NEXT JOB WILL BE AT THE AMERICAN HERITAGE INSTITUTE
272 , WHICH IS A RIGHT WING POLICY TANK IN DC THAT SPENDS IT'S TIME FIGURING
273 OUT HOW TO SUBVERT BASIC AMERICAN FREEDOMS, AND PASSING THESE IDEAS
274 ON TO IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT, INDUSTRY, ETC. IT'S BASICALLY THE
275 SAME FUNCTION AS PERFORMED INTERNALLY BY THE KGB IN THE USSR, BUT IN THE
276 U.S. THIS FUNCTION IS OFFICIALLY 'DIVORCED' FROM THE GOVERNMENT AS
277 SUCH, AND IS FUNDED INDIRECTLY AT PLACES LIKE THE A.H.I. BY GRANTS
278 FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS.
279    ANYWAY, HIS NEXT JOB IS EXAMINING NEEDED POLICY ON "DIFFICULT QUESTIONS"
280 (NEWSPEAK FOR 'WE'RE GONNA SHAFT YA BUT DON'T WANT TO SAY SO')
281 RAISED BY THE NEED TO KEEP ALL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS FROM PUBLISHING
282 ANYTHING AT ALL WITHOUT PRIOR REVEIW BY SECURITY AGENCIES, NO MATTER HOW
283 LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE RETIREMENT AND NO MATTER HOW INNOCUOUS THE SUBJECT.
284    AS WELL AS DISCUSSING AND DESIGNING POLICY FOR THIS AND OTHER MEANS
285 OF SUPPRESSING THE TRUTH IN THE PRINTED MEDIA, HIS GROUP AT THE A.H.I.
286 IS GOING TO BE EXAMINING THE WHOLE AREA OF DATA COMMUNICATIONS LIKE
287 THAT WHICH WE ARE DOING HERE ESPECIALLY, I PRESUME. SO AT LEAST THIS 
288 KIND OF COMMUNICATION HAS HAD AN EFFECT IN THAT THE GOV. IS TRYING TO
289 FIGURE OUT A WAY OF CONTROLLING US.
290    THIS MEDIUM IS GOING TO BE MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT FOR PROVOKING
291 DISCUSSION AND DISSEMINATION OF THE TRUTH, I SUSPECT. ANOTHER ONE I
292 AM INTERESTED IN IS THE XEROX MACHINE. IF YOU'RE AROUND OFFICES AT 
293 ALL OFTEN YOU'LL RUN INTO A HANDOUT EVERY WEEK ON SOME SUBJECT, OFTEN
294 VULGAR, SOMETIMES QUITE FUNNY. OFTEN THESE HANDOUTS PRESENT THE 
295 VEIWS OF SOME GROUP ON SOCIETY. EVEN IF THIS MEDIUM (TELE) IS 
296 CONTROLLED EVENTUALLY, I SUSPECT THAT IT WILL BE HARD TO SUPPRESS THE
297 USE OF COPY MACHINES.
298    THIS ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE PRESS EQUIPMENT CAN BE QUITE IMPORTANT.
299 THE VIETNAM WAR PROVIDES US WITH A GOOD EXAMPLE. DURING ALL THE EARLY
300 (PRE - 1971) PART OF THAT WAR THE REGULAR PAPERS AND NETWORKS GAVE
301 OUT THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT VERSION OF THE WAR NEARLY EACH AND EVERY DAY.
302 BUT PEOPLE WANTED THE TRUTH ABOUT THE WAR, AND SO IN NEARLY EVERY CITY
303 A CHEAP TABLOID FORM PAPER OF SOME KIND SPRANG UP TO TELL ANOTHER SIDE 
304 OF THE WAR. THESE PAPERS WERE OFTEN QUITE BIASED AND INNACCURATE AS WELL.
305 BUT THEY DID TELL SOME THINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE TOLD. FOR INSTANCE,
306 THE 'LEGITIMATE' PRESS LEARNED ABOUT GOVERNMENT LIES ABOUT ENEMY TROOP
307 STRENGTH THROUGH THE UNDERGROUND PRESS. I MYSELF, WRITING IN ONE OF
308 THESE TABLOIDS (THE SO-CALLED UNDERGROUND PRESS WHICH WAS SOLD ON
309 EVERY STREET CORNER) WAS THE FIRST PERSON WRITING HERE, AS FAR AS I
310 KNOW, TO WRITE ABOUT THE COUP OF POL POT AIDED BY OUR CIA DURING 
311 PRINCE SIHANOUKS STAY IN CHINA (THE FORMER PRINCE OF CAMBODIA, A 
312 NEUTRALIST WHO TRIED TO KEEP HIS COUNTRY WHOLE AND OUT OF THE VIETNAMESE
313 WAR, STILL LIVING IN CHINA SINCE HIS ESCAPE). POL POT AS YOU WILL RECALL,
314 WAS THE MAN WHO PUT THOUSANDS OF HEADS UP ON STAKES AROUND THE CAPITOL
315 AS DECORATION, AND THE REASON WHY MANY OF OUR OWN PEOPLE THINK THAT 
316 THE CAMBODIANS ARE BETTER OFF UNDER THE VIETNAMESE, AHRD AS THAT IS TO
317 BELIEVE. THIS COUP WAS EASY TO PREDICT AS I READ THE PRESS OF
318 OTHER COUNTRIES EVERY DAY, AND THE SIGNS WERE CLEAR.
319    AFTER A WHILE, WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS
320 WITH THE OFFICIAL TRUTH PUT OUT BY THE GOVT., THE 'LEGITIMATE '
321 PRESS BEGAN TO DO GOOD REPORTING OF IT'S OWN. BY THIS TIME THE 
322 READERSHIP IF THE UNDERGROUND PRESS IN PORTLAND HAD GOTTEN TO BE OVER
323 100,000 PER WEEK.
324    LATER, ALL OF US "CANDY ASS LIBERALS", TO QUOTE A MARXIST AQUAINTANCE
325 OF THE TIME, WERE OUSTED FROM THE PAPERS BY A NATIONAL COUP CARRIED OUT
326 BY THE FAR LEFT. THATS ABOUT THE TIME 'KILL THE PIGS' GOT TO BE A BIG
327 HEADLINE. WE COULDN'T STOP IT, CAUSE THE OFFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF THESE PAPERS
328 WAS OFTEN IN DOUBT, AND THERE WERE MORE OF THEM, THE TAKEOVER WAS WELL
329 CO-ORDINATED, AND SO ON. THEY LASTED ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE PEOPLE
330 STOPPED READING THE PAPERS COMPLETELY, BECAUSE OF THE UGLY TONE THEY HAD
331 TAKEN ON, AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAD BECOME OUT AND OUT PROPAGANDA
332 ORGANS FOR THE FAR LEFT (WEATHERMEN, AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTY, ETC)
333    MEANWHILE, THE JOB HAD BEEN DONE. THE NATION HAD BEEN AWAKENED.
334 AND THE WAR DID EVENTUALLY WIND DOWN BECAUSE OF IT. AT THE SAME TIME,
335 THE EVIRONMENTAL AND CONSERVATIONIST, ALTERNATIVE POWER, TRUTH
336 IN ADVERTISING, CONSUMERIST GROUPS, AND RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS GROUPS
337 HAD ALL BEEN GIVEN A GOOD FOOTHOLD IN THE 'LEGITIMATE PRESS'
338    THE POINT OF ALL THIS IS (YES, AT LAST), THAT IT IS NOT THE 
339 'LEGITIMATE PRESS THAT ONE SHOULD LOOK TO FOR PROTECTION. THEY ARE NOT
340 THE 'FREE PRESS' THAT THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION WANTED TO PROTECT.
341 THEY WERE REALLY MORE INTERESTED IN PROTECTING PEOPLE LIKE PAMPHLETEERS
342 , FOR INSTANCE, THOMAS PAINE. IT IS THE SINGLE INDIVIDUAL, SPEAKIN
343 OUT IN WHATEVER MEDIUM HE OR SHE CAN GET HANDS ON, THAT PROTECTS THE TRUTH.
344 IN THIS DAY AND AGE OF MILLION DOLLAR NEWSPAPER PRESSES AND $200 TERMINALS,
345 THAT MEANS THE TERMINAL IS THE INSTRUMENT OF THE REAL FREE PRESS.
346 AND PEOPLE WITH XEROX MACHINES. AND GRAFFITI SLOGANEERS WITH SPRAY CANS.
347 WHEREVER THE PRESS IS HARD TO LOCATE, THE MACHINE HIDDEN, THE AUTHOR
348 UNKNOWN, THAT IS WHERE THE REAL FREE PRESS EXISTS. 
349    BWMS IS A PART OF THAT. HOPEFULLY THEY WON'T DO TO US WHAT THEY DID
350 TO HAM RADIO OPERATORS, WHO ARE EFFECTIVELY GAGGED. 
351    SOMEBODY WAS ASKING FOR EXAMPLES OF SUPPRESSION OF THE PRESS BY THE
352 GOVERNMENT, FOR INSTANCE A PARTICULAR STORY. I OFFER THE EXAMPLE
353 OF THE FCC AND NIXON AIDES CALLING UP NETWORK HEADS DURING THE VIETNAM
354 ERA THREATENING TO CANCEL STATION LICENSES IF THE NETWORKS DIDN'T
355 TOE THE LINE ON REPORTING THE WAR. REMEMBER AGNEW?

360  Pam: official UNICOM status report:
361   It appears that a multi-user version of the operating system that UNICOM
362 was planned to run on is availiable. This OS will permit UNICOM to support
363 more than one user on the system simultaniously (with extra phone/modem); so
364 I have decided to write the system software under it. I should have a copy 
365 Monday. As to a BW type section, there is a distinct possibility that an
366 extraordinarily good emulation of BW will be included. This is pending my
367 decision of wether to use the BW hardware in UNICOM or in my private 
368 telecomunication facilities (I was originally going to incorporate it in,
369 but looking it over It seems a little to nice to "throw away") (the BW 
370 hardware is a distinct module, and is entirely separate from the UNICOM
371 base hardware). Other pending questions are (question was just resolved..
372 it has to be this way..) wether to make the 256k ram look like memory or
373 floppy or hard disk( resolution is hard disk ) (required for multi-user
374 OS handlers..) System target date is still Jan 1. First month of opertion
375 will be experimental; I will pay all expenses out of pocket, no montly
376 dues will be collected until the system stabilizes. UNICOM member 
377 invitations will begin appearing on various boards solicting membership
378 from individuals who have been responsible and creative enuf to attract
379 my and my helpers' attention. General invatations will also be distributed
380 soliciting intrested parties to contact me for membership evaluation; and/
381 or user referendum (if i havn't seen enough of someone to judge their 
382 level of BB interaction, I will submit the question of their membership
383 to the UNICOM public for vote).

394 SO. HERE IT IS FOLKS. THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF 'TOO MANY
395 MERLYNS'. THIS IS THE FIRST MERLYN (BY THE WAY).
396  I AM GOING TO CHANGE MY ALIAS. MY TEACHER AND I HAVE TALKED IT OVER AND SINCE HE WAS THE ONE WHO CAME UP WITH THE NAME I 
397 AGREED TO LET HIM
398 KEEP IT. WE WERE THINKING OF ANOTHER ALIAS FOR ME AND COULD ONLY
399 COME UP WITH 'CYNGUS'. I LIKED IT BUT AM NOT GOING TO USE IT. YOU WILL ALL SEE
400 WHAT I COME UP WITH SOON. SOOOO, THE ORIGIONAL MERLYN IS NO LONGER MERLYN. THE SECOND MERLYN IS NOW MERLYN. THE THIRD MERLYN CA
401 TAKE A HIKE. FIND ANOTHER ALIAS TOO WHILE YOU ARE AT IT. AND DON'T DARE USE THE
402 SAME ONE I DO AGAIN. TO HROTHGAR: I AM ORIGIONAL. THE OTHER ONES MAY NOT BE. THEY ARE JUST CHEAP COPIES. (SORRY TEACH.).
403 TO MERLYN (SINCE I HAVE RETIRED THE NAME): HAD FUN AFTER WE GOT OUT OF THE HAUNTED HOUSE. BUT LETS NOT EVER DO IT AGAIN OKAY??
404 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>NO ONE YET<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
405 TO ABOVE: TYPE "OFF" NEXT TIME, OR YOU MAY FIND PART OF YOUR MESSAGE LOST.
406 SAME TO EVERYONE ELSE. PLEASE TYPE "OFF" WHEN YOU ARE THROUGH ENTERING, OR
407 THE FILE IS NOT CLOSED AND YOUR LAST FEW LINES MAY DISSAPEAR FOREVER.
408 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
409 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
410 I DID TYPE 'OFF'.
411 ALSO TO HELP DILUTE SOME OF THE CONFUSION TO WHICH MERLYN IS WHICH....
412 THE ONE WHO UNCLAIMED THE TITLE IS THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN HERE AT THE INN
413 LONGEST OUT OF THE THREE.

420 Hrothgar:I agree regarding usefulness of outside viewpoints (even biased 
421 ones!). I was in high school at "height" of 'Nam. Every day in "Humanities 
422 we would compare rough "transcripts" of network news with similarly rough 
423 "transcripts" made by some of us who could listen to Radio Hanoi, Radio 
424 Moscow, Radio Peking, etc. We realized that the instructors were sticking
425 their necks out by encouraging this, so we tried not to be TOO critical of 
426 "our" side's news at school. But we still had a few instances of "where did 
427 get that DUMB idea". 
428 Would you (or anyone else) know where I could pick up or better yet,
429 subscribe to, the English language edition of "Pravda"? The only line I've 
430 been able to get so far is on the Russian edition. Since I don't really feel
431 like learning Russian, this isn't much help. (I wonder if CIS could be 
432 persuaded to put the TASS newswire on-line. Nah, It'd be too EXPENSIVE.....)
433 Merlyn:re your "once you quit worrying about 'right & wrong' you will
434 find you aren't wrong." I disagree, with the exception of moral questions
435 right & wrong should be defined operationally. In other words, it is right 
436 if it works, if it doesn't work it is wrong. (& if it has no effect on the
437 job or problem then it is irrelevant & superfluous).
438 You have fallen afoul of the tendency of most languages to assign many 
439 widely variant meanings to the same word. Oh, and by the way, your "all my
440 statements, including this one, are lies" is dealt with in most logic texts.
441 Try "Symbolic Logic" by Irving M. Copi for instance. Basicly, you are 
442 confusing the object language & the meta-language.
443 _____________________________________Leonard________________________________
444 HROTHGAR: AN INTERESTING RANT IF I DO SAY SO. YOU HAVE EXPLAINED BETTER
445 THEN I HAVE SEEN BEFORE THE TRUE CONCEPT OF BWMS. I WONDER IF ANYONE
446 KNOWS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LAST FRIDAY? I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT, IT HAD TO
447 DO WITH A CERTAIN PARTY IN BOSTON A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. ANYWAY, AS
448 YOU SAID HROTHGAR, THE CREATERS OF THE CONSTITUTION (AND BILL OF RIGHTS)
449 DID INDEED INTEND TO PROTECT THE LITTLE GUY. LEAST WE FORGET THAT THEY
450 HAD BEEN IN THAT EXACT SAME POSITION THEMSELVES, AND WERE PAINFULLY 
451 AWARE OF ITS NEED. THE SANCTIONED PRESS WILL NORMALLY TOW THE LINE 
452 SIMPLY BECUSE THEY HAVE A LOT TO PROTECT, SO THEY DON'T WANT TO JEPORDIZE
453 IT BY SAYING NASTY THINGS ABOUT UNCLE SAM OR WHATEVER. BECAUSE THOUGH WE
454 DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO FREE PRESS HERE, UNCLE ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO 
455 HARASS THEM IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS. I SUBSCRIBE TO WORLD PRESS IN REVIEW
456 MYSELF, WHILE I FIND THE STORIES VERY INTERESTING, I FIND A GREAT DEAL
457 OF INTEREST IN THE POLITICAL CARTOONS. YOU CAN TELL AN AWFULL LOT ABOUT
458 WHAT THE FEELINGS OF THE COUNTRY ARE BY A SIMPLE DRAWING. (NOTE: THAT I
459 SAY THE COUNTRIES FEELINGS, AND NOT THE PEOPLE. - TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
460 ENTIRLY -) I ALSO SUBSCRIBE TO A NUMBER OF OTHER RAGS AS WELL, INCLUDING
461 NEW SCIENTIST. WHICH IS A BRITISH SCIENCE WEEKLY THAT GIVES AN INTERESTING
462 VIEWPOINT FROM THE BRITISH DIRECTION. I ALSO SUBSCRIBE TO REASON MAG 
463 WHICH THOUGH A BIT OUTLANDISH AT TIMES SOME REAL JEWELS CAN BE FOUND IN
464 IT. THEY DELIGHT IN DIGGING UP NASTY LITTLE HIDDEN THINGS THAT THE 
465 GOVERNMENT WOULD JUST AS SOON BE LEFT HIDDEN. THE MAIN INPORTANCE HERE
466 IS THAT REASON SPENDS AS MUCH TIME ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS THEY DO
467 ON THE FEDS. THERE IS JUST AS MUCH (IF NOT MORE) LOCAL NASTIES AS THERE
468 ARE NATIONALY. IN CONCLUSION, THERE IS ONE PHRASE COMING FROM A POLITICIANS
469 MOUTH THAT FRIGHTENS ME MORE THEN ANY OTHER (FOR THAT MATTER OUT OF
470 ANYONES MOUTH) "THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD." HOW WOULD THEY KNOW, THEY ARE
471 NOT IN MY SHOES. BESIDES I HAVE FOUND THAT 90% OF THE TIME THEY ARE AFTER
472 SOME THING FOR THEMSELVES AND COULD CARE LESS ABOUT MY WELFARE. (THE OTHER
473 10% IS JUST MISGUIDED FOOLISHNESS.) THIS THINKING HAS LEAD TO AMONG OTHER
474 THINGS THE HIGHEST TAX RATE IN OUR NATIONS HISTORY. (I WONDER HOW FAST
475 OUR FOREFATHERS ARE SPINING?) (OH LORD I'M BEGINING TO SOUND LIKE ANON!
476 I BETTER SHUT UP AND GO TO WORK.)

481 Greetings and salutations: 'tis I, Merlyn (now the one and only).
482 People like to categorize my philosophy (if one exists) in many
483 ways.  Solopsism is *not* entirely accurate.  All philosophies
484 and religious knowledge systems FAIL if one approaches them as
485 the answer to the way in which one knows.  Only questions are
486 powerful.  But of course, questions are not what the Western
487 thinker wants.  Hence, the paradox.  All your thinking is held
488 within a box... you cannot even recreate my point-of-view within
489 your current box.  You attempt to label that which I project
490 with terms that fit your current understanding.  What I speak
491 cannot be understood, only known (but not before it really IS
492 known).  My student (once known as Merlyn #1) will choose a new
493 name.  I will be around, as I always have been.  Pragmatism
494 is the ONLY answer.  Merely notice what works and what doesn't
495 work.  Do not be fooled into believing that what you have
496 figured out that MUST work will necessarily work.  Only
497 that which produces results, produces results.  Be aware, be
498 concious, but mostly be able to ride the horse in the direction
499 it is going.  In a you vs. the universe struggle, the victor
500 is obvious.  Think about it, but don't think about it.
501 -- Merlyn (creator of enlightened bullshit, to confront the masses)

504          THIS IS PRETTY PRAGMATIC STUFF, MERYLN,
505          WHERE'S THE IMAGINATION YOU PROMISED?
506                      Walt Disney
507 ###############################################################
508 Oh sure, I know all you cynics out there will say Walt Disney 
509 is dead. Well so what.  Alot of nice people are dead and 
510 it doesn't make them any less nice. I think we should be 
511 thankful that Walt took the time to join us today.

513 As for me.....give me poetry, or give me a good ol' Tea Pahty.  PRevere

516 Aaron...regarding Unicom, it sounds like your system is moving right along.
517 I imagine you, as a person who knows something about getting on other
518 computers, are trying to incorporate as much protection as you can into
519 the system. Another point...awhile back you mentioned you were NOT going
520 to monitor the system(ala BWMS) as far as message content goes, except
521 for the usual deletion of 4-letter messages and such. With some of the
522 recent rulings and new laws in certain states regarding computer
523 operators(sysops) responsibility for what information is presented on their
524 system, are you thinking of modifying your policy? Also, in registering
525 next term for the `U', what does your schedule look like so far? Like
526 I said before, meeting there sounds like a good idea to me.
527 To Hrothgar...You certainly do have an interesting past! Since I was merely
528 a tyke in the days of vietnam, about the only thing I remember clearly
529 about the media's reporting of the war was the body counts given at the
530 end of the 6:00 news every night. Where they would show a little blue man
531 and he represented the Americains, and a little red man, and he represented
532 the enemy. War reduced to nothing more than statisitcs, given in monotone.
533 A sad state of affairs indeed.
534 To PAM. Another person glad to see you back too. Regarding your comment
535 about the uselessness of our debate: If even one person gets a little
536 better understanding of the world around him through the messages on BWMS,
537 then I think the discussions here have changed something. Maybe nothing
538 major, but something. To me, BWMS has evolved beyond a simple medium to leav
539 messages, it has become something I use to expand my horizon. Several
540 times I have printed or captured text for later perusal. Sometimes I
541 have brought some of the better compositions to work for me fellow
542 workers. It may be small, but BWMS does serve a useful purpose, as I am
543 sure you will agree. thanks
544 ...............tHE dROPPED bIT...........................................
545 PS TO RAY...You are right, but I unfortunatly find a lot of prejudice
546 toward young people, and I sometimes get a little carried away defending
547 my age too. Sorry.
548 ..........................................................................
549 HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED HOW THEY OVER-USE THE WORDS 'THICK AND RICH ON TV?
550 IT REALY BUGS ME. HAS ANYBODY EBER~~~VER TASTED SHAMPOO TO SEE IF IT IS
551 THICK AND RICK~H? I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
552 OH WELL I WILL BE BACK LATER WITH SOME OTHER THINGS THAT ANNOY ME.

563 LEONARD -- I don't know where you can pick up an English
564 language edition of Pravda locally, but even the cheapest
565 short wave receiver will pick up Radio Moscow, which has a
566 particularly strong signal here on the west coast. I think

575 DEAR LEONARD : DO'T KNOW ABOUT PRAVDA. I'VE ALWAYS FOUND IT A PRETTY

577 ANYWAY. MIGHT TRY U OF O BOOKSTORE OR REED COLLEGE. REED MIGHT BE THE BEST 
578 BET, IN FACT. I AM ASHAMED TO ADMIT THAT I AM NOT READING ANYTHING
