49 We departed from the forest of crystal.  Moving up a short rise, we found ourselves at the base of the citidel.
50 The citidel was quite tall, it stretched up higher and higher as we looked.  No entrances were apparent.  I collapsed
51 on the grass near it, tired by my efforts.  We formed a circle on the ground and began to talk about what we should do.
52 A noise startled me.  I whirled about, searching for the source of the noise.  A seven-foot tall box-like object sat on
53 the grass even closer to the citidel than we were, and a man stood before it.  Odd that no one had noticed him on the 
54 climb up.  Wait, I recognised him... the Doctor!  Bard yelled a greeting.  The Doctor popped into his TARDIS for a 
55 moment (I realized what it was now), thene popped back out.  He carried a handled bag covered with runes.  Why, that was
56 my bag!  "All right, you don't have do suck the TARDIS down to this godforsaken planet just to get your bag back.  All
57 I wanted to do was study it awhile."  He set the bag down near me, and I made room for him in the circle.  As the others
58 talked with him, I rummaged about in the bag to see what it contained.  Spellbooks, empty pocket for the 3x5 cards, two
59 potions of unknown composition, several sticks of various woods, and a pouch of dust.  Good, spell components.  Things
60 might get interesting now.  I smiled and looked up as a large section of wall of the citidel slid up and revealed a
61 deep passage beyond.
62 The Doctor quipped, "Well, someone inviting us to tea.  Shall we go?"

66 The Innkeeper sat at his own bar, staring dejectedly at an 
67 untouched drink drawing small circles in a spot of collected 
68 moisture on the counter. "It's not worth it I tell you!" He 
69 screams to the empty space behind the bar. "I come here to get
70 away from the angry world outside, and all I get is more abuse!" 
71 "I don't see why I should continue if it serves not the need." 
72 He gives the drink a shove, and it flies crashing against the 
73 metalwork covering the back bar.
74 
75 At this a collected shout of "NO!" shakes the Inn to its very 
76 foundations. The word spreads quickly of the Innkeepers intent of 
77 retirement, and he is quite taken aback by the response, as one 
78 by one the faithful customers file in to personally express their 
79 concern, support and desperate desire that the Inn not be closed.
80 
81 Turning around to face the now crowded Inn, He says; "My friends, 
82 I don't know what to say. No, I won't close the Inn. It was just 
83 my anger and frustration inapproprately directed at the last 
84 assult of a string of many. Normally a minor irritation, it was 
85 this time a catalysis to the intense internal presure ready to 
86 explode on the first touch." 
87 
88 "Piper, Leonard, Milchar, Valinor, Promethus, Mez, Sondagaurd, L'homme
89 MiG, Kathy, Tammy.... and Pam, dear Pam... All of you! Thank you for
90 your concern, and I humbly apoligize for the distress I have caused
91 you. So the drinks are on the house... The Inn lives!"

95   Sondargaard; Now see here, Dear Fellow, I went to the library of the school with confused last letters, and yet I found not
96 a single book specifically on or about me.  But, I must be remisss, for perhaps I misread a clue along the path.  Perhaps I
97 have only lost my way!  This must be the case!  So I shall go to Archives format for a bit, and find the original clue.  Soon
98 thereafter I shall join the game.  The game is afoot!
99   h yes, afore I forget, Dear Fellow, I have no official connection to either Ludlum or Christie, but about Nathaniel...

103 The Former sweeps in from the cold with white cape and leaf, only to find the the color has returned to the cheeks of those in
104 view.  And the glare in many peoples eyes turned to reflection of the flames that light the Inn.
105   Assuming only the worst, ven now, he wanders over to an obscure table and climbs on top. Soon he is sleeping and, like all
106 marcupials, sobbs during his dreams. But the dreams are only a portion of his sorrows.
107   Actually they only reflect his fear and shame in downmouthing the Inn enough to make the Innkeeper forsake the whole lot of
108 them. Everyone must sincerely despise him now, and soom, a few will scream at him, and then he will be ostricized forever.
109   Secretly immersing himself in shame and torment, he hears the Lady Pam screaming at him. Cursing the fool forever.
110   Ignoring her screams as they stab into his ears, he returns to his dream state, the only safe place left for him.
111   As her screams die inside his ears, and he dreams, he recinds from the Inn, and takes shelter in the protection of nicer
112 memories of nicer times. Times when anyone liked him, or even would tolerate him. None of that was true anymore...
113   Screaming no as loudly as his voice would allow, in went into a blathering state. Apologizing for everything from the murder
114 of Abraham Lincoln to stealing some string from a girl named Sarah. Any event where people despised the accused he apologized 
115 sincerley for. Any event that could be said when blathering, that is...
116   The Lady Pam soothed him in words and explanations of permanency. And a few complements every so often to cheer him up.
117   Sitting on a table and forcing Pam to sit halfway on the table, he started to feel shame again.
118   After giving her a seat, he lanmented that they both ought to apologize for having screamed so loudly. Tears were drying, so
119 were some other peoples tears also, he dared to think.

122  Please don't close down the Inn.  This is the last watering hole
123 in a vast desert.  I'm sitting here with a sad thought of nowhere
124 to go, nothing to do.  But I can imagine the feeling that Mickey
125 is going through so I hope I understand.  I'll be sorry to see it
126 here no longer, a brand new year and I'll be feeling so down and
127 worthless.  I don't know if this all makes any sence, I fear I am
128 just rambling along like a horrer stricken child, all cold and empty
129 inside.  Not knowing what to say or what to do.......  
130  If you love something let it go... If it loves you it will come back.
131  I'm sorry but I'm to emotional to say anything constructive.  I'm
132 too scared beyond rational thought.  
133  Please please think about it please?

135         As every started on the free drinks , a figure at a corner table stood.
136 Raising his glass he cried, "A toast! To Michael, our innkeeper!"
137        As the innkeeper's face took on a most astonishing expression, the toast
138 was echoed around the room. Barely had the glasses been emptied, when someone
139 shouted - "Three cheers for the innkeeper!"
140 
141         "HURRAH!"     "HURRAH!"    "HURRAH!"
142 
143    The inn shook with the thunder of the united voices...
144 ..............................the apprentice.................................
145 L'homme: are you going to PAUG this week?
146 Voyeur: Yes, DEC0582, DEC2282, & MAY2083 are all files that we WILL get in the
147         next batch of disks. (I *DID* leave room!)
148 Film Fan: re-"Exterminator", I believe there is a film by that title in release
149         currently. Thus the criticism of your use of that name.
150 Kathy:  I like the story, but I had an unintended reaction to the last 
151         installment. You spelled "abyss" as "abbess". Since an abbess is the
152         lady in charge of an abbey, you can imagine my reaction when I read
153         of Leo & Ontho plunging into the abbess....
154         (oh well, we all make mistakes & I don't think that there is a
155         spelling checker on the market that would have caught that...)
156 Mikey: After careful consideration, I realize that you have extracted FULL
157         revenge from me for making so many 'complaints' (er, I mean 
158         SUGGESTIONS, of course...)
159         You gave ME the code and said "Fine, do it yourself." I am properly 
160         chastised. (Now about that code at.....)(I never learn, do I?)

165 Line up all the letters of the alphabet in a row as show below:
166 HIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFG
167 
168 Now remove those letters which look the same in a mirror:
169   JKL N PQRS      Z BCDEFG
170 
171 Now add up the number of letters in each group:
172    31416 (the first five letters of pie)
173 
174 Try this one the next time you have your calculator out; Divide 2143 by 22, 
175 then get the square root of the answer, and then get the square root of 
176 that answer, you will have pie correct to eight digits. Want a quicker 
177 calculation? Try the square root of 9.87 (note that they are the last three 
178 standard decimal numbers in reverse order.) It is correct to four digits.
179 
180 And of course as we all know that pie are square; Pie is the 16th letter in 
181 the greek alphabet, which is the square of 4. Or, the english letter P 
182 which is also the 16th letter of the English alphabet.
183 
184 Did you know that the first 12 dozen numbers (144) of pie add up to 666 
185 (The number of the beast, where have I heard THAT one before?) Also note 
186 that 144=(6+6)*(6+6). The moral? Don't eat pie, or you will go to that 
187 theological place of eternal punishment.
188 
189 How about the three numbers starting from the 666th postion in pie '343';
190 343=7*7*7? ....No, that's pushing it a bit too far.
191 
192 The point is that if you look long enough, you can find coincidences just 
193 about any place you like. The greater the resources you have to work with, 
194 the better the chances of finding the coincidence you want.

217      Lenoard: Chuckle, snort, yuk,yuk, too funny for words. Actually
218 I thought I had written that one far enough down on the disk that no
219 one whould take time to read it.  and now...
220      As they were moving towards the mind control power sourse, Leo 
221 hesitated, She wanted to know what they were getting into first. Ok
222 Ontho lets not attack now, lets find out a little about this culture first."
223      Ontho was surprized at how rational Leo was actting, not like her at 
224 all.  The Inmo slowed and started crusing down into the rows of dwellings.
225 It all seemed quite tranquil, quiet, children moving about with burdens
226 and running errands. One thing was apparant, A species of Alien Leo had
227 never seen before. They were quite large, the average height about 8 feet.
228 and they were kind of a dirty yellow in color. They had two long arms and
229 two short legs. At the end of the arms were claws. (more like lobster than
230 kitty). At the end of the legs were boots. (no telling what was under those
231 hunkers). It seemed as thought they had heads also, but they were kind of
232 triangles at the top. No eyes could be detected.  More importantly these
233 Aliens were carrying weapons. They were definitly in control. ( and they
234 looked mean!) Ontho seemed quite distresed to see that other Inmo's seemed
235 to be caught in the control of the yuglies.  ( kinda a cute name ehh?)
236      But why the earthquakes? and why were they underground? It seems that
237 a major quake would knock this place flat. More investiagtion was nessasary
238 before they let every one know they were there with an attack.

262 emotional pressure about the Inn.  Ahh, back to adventure.
263   
264    The piper was the last to follow the rest into the citadel.  He was tired --
265 deep bone tired, exhausted in body and spirit.  To keep his spirits from 
266 dragging down the morale of the rest of the party, he had maintained the facade
267 and put forth the impression that he was his old self,         but he was tired.
268 At the portal, for the briefest moment, his guard slipped, and had any of the
269 party turned toward him, they would have recoiled from the pain reflected in his
270 eyes.  Regaining his composure, he stepped briskly behind the party, his eyes
271 and all senses alert, guarding the rear from any danger that he could sense.
272 Sternly controlling his wandering mind, he withdrew from his emotions -- his 
273 overriding sense of loss -- the image of a winged horse-like creature, the
274 pegasus he had left in the Ruby Valley.  Somehow he had formed an emotional
275 bond with the animal, and it's absence was continual torment to him.
276   Back in the Ruby Valley, the pegasus was also unhappy.  She, too, longed for
277 the presence of someone absent.  The emotional bond was strong.  Her eyes 
278 flashed fire, and the heat from her nostrils crisped the grass she tried to
279 crop, as she tried to reassure herself that he would return.  He could not 
280 leave that strange collection of sticks and skins thay he loved to play riding
281 her high in the evening air.  She nosed the bagpipes and lay down beside it,
282 trying vainly again to wait patiently for his return.

288 Mikey,
289         I join in concert with the other patrons of the Inn in expressing 
290 my grateful appreciation of this forum you so selflessly provide. Too
291 often we take for granted the sublime atmosphere of the establishment
292 we occupy in favor of the personae found therein. Only when threatened
293 by its death does the contrast of its life take on such an individual 
294 absolute value. In my case you provide safe harbor in a sea of banality.
295 For others, an outlet for their creative thoughts. And collectively......
296 They form infinite facets on a precious stone we call " Backwater ".
297         My support and the support of all but a few is more than available.
298 You need but ask. And when the Inn's time has come the memories will be 
299 part of my greatest possesions.

303      The men in the funny white coats took me to see Andre Watts, the 
304 classical pianist, last night.  I never believed that a human being could
305 make music like that, simply amazing.  He must be even better than...      
306 than...        Liberace?
307      I know... Classical music is high-brow, stuffy, and boring.  I'm not
308 a real expert on the stuff, but it's better than
309                UNIVERSAL MINDS SUCK DIRT!!!!

313 me for my birthday was darling.  The people at the concert kept staring at
314 it and whispering.  Boy, was I proud.  They say I'll be getting out of the
315 hospital soon.  I hope we can get together to talk about old times.  Give
316 me a call, I'm in the book.

354     What do you think of Tegan and Nyssa? Wow!!  Tonights was some really 
355  weird stuff going on. Its too bas that each episode is only 23 minutes long
356      Also who watched that movie "Children in the crossfire" pretty 
357  interesting. 
358   Lets here some pro's and Con's about it. Personally I think that the 
359  British troops should remain because if they left the Catholics and the 
360  Protestants would tear each other apart if allowed to. This is probably
361  due to my English heritage and to my    great sorrow of the end of 
362      PAX BRITTANIA of which N.Ireland 
363  and Hong Kong are some of the last.

370 12/ 5/84 21:49,yup it works here, too.
371 Im' playing with the Popalrm program. It's well worth the stated price,
372 which is "free". Actually it only costs $5. It can put a clock in a
373 window on the screen over most anything, or start a program - or alarm-
374 at any time. Cute. Will I buy the rest of the Pop-clan? No, not in a
375 world with Sidekick.
376 Is it too much tech talk here to ask what brand of discs you use,or
377 don't use, and why? I just had 3 bad out of a box of 10 Maxell. Never
378 had any trouble with them before, but 30% is rather high fallout.
379 ......................................BAD..................

381 Slowly we strode into the vast hallway that had appeared out of nowhere.  I sensed a vauge longing as I studied
382 the cold, hard walls of the route, but I pushed it down farther back in my mind.  Too busy with other things.
383 The hall streched for some time longer.  The walls hummed slightly as if precision machinery worked behind them, 
384 their noises muffled by the odd metal.    We pressed on.  Finally, the hall opened up into an enormous chamber.  The 
385 walls were decorated with many carvings  from several cultures, and the ceiling was oramented with precious stones of 
386 tremendous size.  The floor itself was barren except for a column of metal in the center, a tall pillar extending from
387 top to bottom.  We spread out a bit to search more ground.
388 A high whine sounded from behind.  The hall that had opened up so convienently before was now gone.  Another whine
389 emanated from the pillar, but this time we were quick enough to see the section of wall part with the floor.  Ah, an 
390 elevator, or so it seemed.
391 "An invitation indeed, Doctor.  What do you think of our host, so far?", I asked.
392 "I don't think bloody much of him.  No sign of crumpets or tea anywhere.", he replied.  Ah, yes, now I remembered the 
393 Doctor's infatuation with all food English.  "Not a crumb.", he muttered.
394 Piper seemed to grow more agitated as we spoke.  I looked at him for a moment, then thought.  I concentrated to fling
395 my thought directly at him, with no other overhearing: #No physical pain can match that of longing for a loved one.  I
396 cannot help you, but only tell you that I understand.#  He nodded slightly, his tension slacking a bit.  Nothing helps
397 like sharing the pain, I thought.
398 A surge of warmth from about my neck shook me from my ponderings.  The necklace was more impatient than I to continue.
399 #Rest later...#, a weak thought told me.  "Did anyone else catch that thought?", I asked.  All heads but the Doctor's 
400 nodded assent.  He seemed to be too worried about his food to catch anything more than a cold.  I smiled thinly at my 
401 poor joke.  I shouldn't pick on the Doctor for his strange thought patterns and habits.  His abilities are what count. 
402 There must be some reason why his TARDIS had been pulled here.....
403 L'homme led the way into the strange pillar as we continued, I following, Bard next, Lila close after, followed by
404 Piper, Leonard, and the Doctor.  A hiss of steam erupted from a pipe somewhere far below as we asended the citidel.

409    I couldn't feel my toes anymore.  In a way, I was happy, since I couldn't
410 feel the pain anymore either.  On a more sensible level, though, I realized
411 that they were frozen.  The way things were going, they were only preceeding
412 the rest of me by a few hours.  I stopped by a fallen tree, brushed the snow
413 from it and sat down.  Bending over, I untied the wrappings from my feet
414 and wrung the moisture from the rags, then retied them over my sandals, trying not
415 to look at the whiteness of my feet.  The steam from my breath helped to 
416 obscure the unpleasant sight.  Straightening, I looked back along my trail,
417 where my footprints disappeared over the hill.  When I was finally missed,
418 they would make it all too easy to track me down.  My only hope was that it
419 would start snowing harder and cover them, but that would also finish me that
420 much sooner.  All in all, a rather bleak situation.
421    I knew that I could always turn around, admit defeat, and return to the
422 commune.  They would smile at me, treat me with much kindness, and increase the
423 dosage of whatever it was in my food.  Soon I would be one with them again,
424 a mindless automaton, praying their mantras, joining blissfully in their
425 orgies, polishing His latest 4-wheeler, and for all practical purposes being
426 dead.  No, I had been an independant soul all my life; if I was going to be
427 dead anyway, I'd do it on my terms - out here where I was nominally Free.
428 If I went back now, I'd never have another chance to get away.  It had only
429 been the commotion caused by that other escape that had given me the
430 opportunity to slip away.  
431    My chapped lips cracked as I smiled, remembering the strange sight.
432 Two people in costume, one looking like a penguin, kidnapping (or rescuing,
433 depending on your point of view) a collegue who had fallen in with the cult
434 a few weeks earlier.  I vaguely recalled his name - Bill; a rather spaced-
435 out character even discounting the drugs in the food.  I hoped that they'd get
436 away all right.  Their chances were probably a lot better than mine, since they
437 had a car, even if it was a topless convertible.
438    I stood up, pulled the thin blanket over my green cult uniform, and started
439 walking again.  The woods looked thicker up ahead, and perhaps I could find
440 some decent shelter from the threatening snow.  The junipers hereabouts didn't
441 help too much, but those pine looked more substantial.
442    It was hard walking.  The snow was up to midcalf, and my feet felt like
443 blocks on the end of my legs.  Unless I found proper shelter, I knew I wouldn't
444 survive the night.  On previous occasions when all hope had seemed to be lost,
445 my some-time employer had bailed me out with some deus ex machina, but I had
446 been out of touch with him for at least 4 months.  I had probably been written
447 off a long time ago.  
448 The though made me wonder about my erstwhile companions.  We had been following
449 one of the commune leaders when there had been some sort of accident involving
450 a worker.  Ma River's gasp of shock was the last I remembered for a long time,
451 until the haziness began clearing a few weeks ago.  (the commune had been
452 importing street people from around the country, in hopes of taking over the
453 county.  The great influx of people had overtaxed their supply of drug; they
454 had had to dilute the doses.  That, with my increasing tolerance of the drug,
455 and I began returning to normal.  When Bill had made his escape, I had been
456 in enough control of myself to make mine too).  I had no idea what had become
457 of my two fellow agents; when I lost consciousness, I lost them too.  I had
458 not seen them around the commune, though, so they were either escaped or dead.
459    I realized that I had been hearing a noise for a while, slowly becoming
460 louder.  Fearing the inevitable pursuit, I began looking around.  Finally
461 looking up, I spied a helicopter slowly aproaching.  Are they That interested
462 in recovering me?  I moved behind a tree, and watched warily.  The wind from
463 the rotors was making the snow fly so I could barely see.  Then the copter 
464 began moving off towards the north, and I saw the Red Cross emblem on the side.
465 Too late I realized that they were out looking for all those missing elk hunters,
466 and my waving of arms accomplished nothing other than to let the cold in under
467 my wrap.  Disconsolately I began trodding ahead again.  If they had already
468 searched this area, it was unlikely they would be back.  I cursed feebly as
469 a glob of snow, dislodged by the passage of the helicopter, fell on my head.
470 Rather a miserable ending, I mused, for someone who had been so successful
471 for so long at getting out of predicaments.  Even in my brushes with McKane I
472 had managed to come out with more than just my hide.  Now I was likely to lose
473 even that.  
474    Ah, McKane.  There had been a worthy adversary.  I had made a habit of
475 thinking of him as evil, but on reflection, I decided that he wasn't really.
476 He was above good or evil.  Evil does what it does Because it is evil.
477 McKane peformed his actions because they helped accomplish his aims - power
478 for powers sake.  Amoral, not immoral.  The more I thought about it, the more
479 I began to realize that he and I were very much alike.  I didn't have his skill
480 or abilities, but in essence, we were two of a kind.  That was why I had always
481 survived our meetings.  This time, though, I had come up against Religion.
482 The force of the religious fanatic is beyond reckoning.  Because they have
483 the authority of 'Right' behind them, they are not stopped by ordinary barriers
484 like death.   Where McKane and I had mutual interests, Dangerfield and I could
485 see nothing the same.  Hence, my present situation.
486    I was staggering now.  I knew I had to stop at a place of my choosing,
487 else I'd collapse and never again rise.  I found a likely looking tree,
488 gathered some loose branches, and made a rough lean-to.  It would keep out some
489 of the wind and snow, but inside I knew that it was only a token attempt.
490 I would fight to the end, but now the end was all too visible.
491 I gathered what leaves and moss I could, built myself a nest, and lay down.
492 As I lay there reviewing my life, I began to feel a warmth stealing through
493 my body.  At first I felt a rise of hope, until I realized that the warmth I
494 felt was merely the onset of hypothermia.  I knew I should get up and jump
495 around; get my blood flowing, but it just didn't seem worth the effort any
496 more.  My thoughts began wandering, and I remembered stories of the Inn that
497 my associate had told me.  As I thought of the Inn, I seemed to feel the
498 echo of some great catastrophe there, but my fading intellect decided that
499 that was merely a figment of my waning consciousness.
500    At last awareness was gone, my heart began to pump slower and slower,
501 the flickering spark of life dimmed......

505 funny (annoying, actually); this episode sounded much better last night
506 as I thought about it while falling asleep.  Oh well.

512   The cold glass was steaming, and the air was getting thick with moisture, and the steel of the engine was fighting for air.
513   Altitude was high, and the snow was swirling above and below the swinging rotors of the white helicopter. Omega leaned his
514 head against the glass, and peered out into the storm.
515   fficially, to the Red Cross, he was newspaper reporter trying to get a first hand account of the search and rescue efforts.
516   Also officially, to Net, he was searching for Agent Carmichael who was doing a surveilance mission for them. When the storm
517 unexpectedly trapped him, intelligence reported a Search and Destroy team was sent out in his general direction.
518 
519   Over to his left, a self-conscious telivision reporter was trying to look good for her first quote unquote Real Assignment.
520   She did have talent at her job, regarded Omega. As much talent as is needed in the profession she had chosen.
521 
522   Checking his watch, he noted that the Search and Destroy team would intersect their flight plan, in thirty minutes, or was
523 it twenty? Trying to resort all the vectors in his mind, his sharp eyes spotted a purple color on the horizon.
524 
525   Realizing quickly that Evergreen trees don't come in purple, he motioned that the helicopter veer away from it, soon.
526 
527   The pilot, thinking he meant that he had spotted a hunter, or tent, simply laid course for the purple apparition. Which, as
528 one might suspect, had a bad effect on Omega Six.
529 
530   As the helicopter dipped and swirled, trying to find an appropriate spot for off-loading the rescue team, it became apparent
531 that there was no 12 man squad, armed to the teeth, and protecting the faith.
532 
533   Someone wearing a neeshie suit was laying in sniper position in a tree. Only the obvious lack of a weapon kept Omega from
534 opening up on him.
535 
536   As all of the occupants off-loaded the copter, Omega ran to keep up with the agile rescue team, if he was a neeshie, he was
537 a run-away, and those were a rare and valuable find.
538 
539   The newswoman and crew were setting up their microwave gear all over the deep snow. Occaisionally a cord would be obscured
540 by falling snow flakes.
541 
542   The pilot was leering at a guage and promising it part of his lunch if it would simply move a bit.
543 
544   The machine guns opened up on the newscrew first, sweeping a misty spray of bullets through the already cold flesh.
545   One spray went through the windshield and pilot of the copter, and further into the white dim of snow. Blood covered all the
546 guages now.
547 
548   Omega was firing now, having dodged into a pile of fallen brances at the first crack of a gun. Aiming for the throat/head
549 area for quick disbursement. Omega was a Net agent to the end.
550 
551   Bodies were slumping to their knees and plunging into the snow at tremendous rates. Those members of the Search and Destroy
552 team still left were spinning long lines of bullets into the brush where Omega was.
553 
554   Rocks were protective only to a certain point, after which they explode with each incoming bullet. Omega knew what happened
555 then.
556   He jerked into a kneeling stance and from their contorted himself into running. A bullet stuck his side.
557   Omega found the tree he was running for, and the bullet dug deeper into his thigh, and one more hit him in the calf.
558 
559   Sent flying into a thick patch of brambles and rocks with mind splitting agony; he broke a rib and his autopistol.
560   Not yet realizing the utter helplessness he was stricken with, he reached for a long dead branch for use as a club.
561 
562   The last remaning member of the Search and Destroy team walked up to the last member of the Rescue team, and said softly,
563 "Dear Lord, look at the," his voice trailed off into ravings about betrayal. And stumbled back in the direction of the Puram,
564 and Dangerfield.
565 
566   Omega waited a moment, shock setting in, and then started wrapping his wounds. Then proceded to find the run-away.

580 PromeTHEUS: If *YOU* don't have the note, the world may be in for alot of
581 trouble, but let's not get too hasty, shall we?
582 1) Are you sure you have looked at *every* book possible; you really are a bit
583    more popular than you think. Actually, the topic can be more diversified
584    than you have imagined.  I'd really like to give you the title of the book,
585    but someone might get to it before you and leave a different note, or may
586    not leave it for you at all (what a malicious train of thought I have.)
587 2) To make things just a little bit easier, in my own mind, why don't you leave
588    *ME* a note in the subject of your choosing so we can both go cray-zee.
589 3) (as in TRI)  Yes, I'm affraid that you are mistaken as to having seen me 
590    lately. If I see you first on Tri-Met, you can believe I'll let you know,
591    eventually.
592 4) Would you like me to leave a can of 'flea powder' at EG for you?
593 5) By the way it's not JCB, it's JBC   (site of screaming as well)

595 SPOOK: I have The Doctor on tape: Everything by T. Baker (#4), the first two

597        regeneration sequences:  3 to 4, 4 to 5, but nothing of #1, #2, or #6.
598        I quite admire Peter Davison as The Doctor in 'The Black Orchid' which
599        is only a two-parter coming up later on.    Well, see you later at UNIT.

607    The hunter had seen the copter landing just over the ridge. He struggled
608 through the snow, praying that they wouldn't take off before he got there.
609    Then he heard what sounded like shots. Maybe someone else was trying to 
610 attract the attention of the crew?
611    He finally reached the scene of the disaster. He stood stunned for a 
612 moment then he quickly checked the cabin of the copter. YES! The ELT was
613 intact! He set it to working and went to check the bodies. 
614    Two of them were still alive but only just. One had apparently been trying
615 to drag them other from a tree to the copter. He got them both into the 
616 copter and bundled them up in all the emergency blankets he could find. Then
617 he dug out some food & sat back to wait, rifle at the ready.
