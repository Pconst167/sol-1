21 L'homme: It is now 12:12am November 7, 1986- I very much doubt I will be at
22 PCS, it being about 4 or 5 hours ago.   I have a Statics class that ends at
23 6:30pm, and in addition, forgot the significance of the first Thursday.  Sigh.
24 How many suckers, ahem, players, are interested in Risk?  Now that I am in
25 Portland, transport is possible...  Keep me in mind if you need another s-

27 On another subject: Still minimal to nil monetary gains with my job, but more
28 hardware to play with is coming my way.  A decent printer, a video digitizer,
29 a sound sampler, and assorted manuals.
30 Leonard:  The remainder of my PC-2 equipment is also showing up.  The RS232

55 Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or

66 Don't you think that there's a need for a constitutional amendment regarding
67 the above.  Congress shouldn't be prohibited for making any law, whatever.
68 Anyhow, this is democractic country.  Sovereignty resides in the people.
69 Congress is the representative elected by the *people*.  And since, the
70 people are the sovereign, their elected representative should be free to do
71 whatsoever the *sovereign* so desire.

115   I disagree. Sovereignty resides with the people, to be sure. But the
116   representatives are not sovereign. Even if indirectly. Fear of a
117   tyrannical sovereign on the shores of the United States was the reason
118   for writing the Bill of Rights. The first amendment was a part of that
119   Bill of Rights. Part of ten amendments limiting the power of the central
120   government. So that no tyranny would develop over the States.

149   Sorry about the delay in posting the story.  I've not been able to
150 get on in a while.  Let's see, we just had the piper entering the mysterious
151 sphere that had appeared in his camp...
152 .pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
153   The piper soon lost all perception of time.  It may have been for only
154 moments, or for countless eterneties that his awareness moved within the
155 glowing sphere.  What we call thought is an inherently complex process.
156 We can capture some of the verbal thoughts that pass through us, but
157 equally complex are the manipulations we perform `perhaps unconciously) on
158 the input from all our senses.  We have nearly no vocabulary for smell, ver
159 little for taste, and almost none for the kinesthetic senses (the interior
160 senses that tell you where your body is and what it is doing).  The
161 piper's raw awareness was floating in a totally alien sphere, recieving
162 input in totally different ways than ever it had before.  The piper's
163 awareness changed, became different.
164   He was floating, bodiless through colored space.  Green sang its restful
165 song as it eddied through him, bringing rest and growth.  Far off, Red
166 counterpointed, echoed by the dull sadness of Grey.  He thinned, and
167 Violet merged into soothing Blue, then muddy Brown violently thickened
168 him.  He responded with a feeble orange, then faded into pink, bringing a
169 loud protest from both Orange and Pink.  The colors exerted a pressure on
170 him until he changed, then suddenly he felt himself in a body again.
171   The piper was standing at the beginning of a path at the foot of a hill.
172 It was early afternoon, the honey-sweet breeze bringing its perfume to him
173 in balmy offering, the quiet buzz of the surrounding insects soothing his
174 weary soul.  The piper looked up the path, winding about the scrub bushes,
175 then set his foot on the first step of the journey.

183      I scavanged my bag, looking for something decent to wear. Finally 
184 settling on a suit with a minimal number of wrinkles, I threw it on and 
185 headed out the door of the hotel room. 
186      I waited as the elevator wisked me efficiently and quietly to the main 
187 ballroom floor. The doors finally swished open and the noise and press of 
188 the crowd replaced the quiet aand calm of a moment before. I looked around 
189 for awhile those I had come with, but it was in vain, I could not find them 
190 in this group. 
191      In a short time the noise, smoke and smell began to overpower me, so I 
192 sought out a quieter location. A pair of double doors in the rear presented 
193 themselves, and I quickly headed for them. They opened to a small hallway. 
194 A few steps further on was a great massive door of rich wood and heavy 
195 glass. Fitting properly in with the decor of the hotel. Through the glass I 
196 could see the outside world. 
197      I stepped up to the window and looked out. The weather was in a nasty 
198 mood, the wind whiped the rain amongst the small tress and scrub brush on 
199 the mountain side, Thrashing them from side to side.  There was nothing to 
200 slow and tame the winds at this highth, so they were always strong and 
201 powerful when they came. But they weren't vicious. The wind just was was it 
202 was. 
203      Without really thinking about it, I stepped outside. The full effect 
204 of the wind and driven bits of rain struck me now, and I quickly grabbed 
205 for the support of a nearby pillar. The wind was refreshing as it scowered 
206 away the heat and smell of the crowded hotel. I felt like it swept through 
207 my very soul, cleaning out bits and peices of dirt and stink that clung so 
208 tightly. 
209      The heavy wood and glass of the building withstood the driving force 
210 of the wind without notice. It was solidly and well built, for those that 
211 placed it here knew what to expect, and put great care in insuring that the 
212 building would be able to withstand anything that nature could throw at it 
213 up here. The lawn and field beyond in front of me was well kept when the 
214 heavy winds were not in force. Now bits of leaves, twigs, and other debree 
215 whipped about following the course layed out by the wind. 
216      Soon I began to take chill, so regretfully I left the embrace of 
217 nature and slipped back into the protection and warmth of the hotel. 
218      As I stood there trying to decide which direction to go, up or down. 
219 An obnoxious drunk came up from the ballroom and tried to get me to partake 
220 of his drink. I declined and quickly headed up the small flight of stairs 
221 to my right. 
222      I found myself in the great kitchen that served the hotel. Turning 
223 around to leave, for I knew that I shouldn't be there, I encountered  
224 someone I knew coming up the stairs. He wasn't a friend, but I always seem 
225 to meet him at these things. He greated me cheerily, and grasping my arm 
226 lead me into the kitchen. The man who had been at his side continued on 
227 without comment and was quickly lost in the maze of equipment. 
228      "I could go for a drink", he stated. "I think I'll have a Gin fizz. 
229 How about you?"
230      "I don't know" I replied, "maybe later." 
231      "Hey, I know what you need!" he stated and before I could respond he 
232 headed towards a small table to the side and began preparing an egg salid. 
233 I watched quietly as he mixed it. He seperated a portion of the unmixed 
234 contents in the bowl, and started throwing in a several spices and a larger 
235 then normal dash of Paprika. 
236      "There you go" he stated as he dished the mix into a clean bowl. 
237 "That'll get you going." 
238      I took the salad, but didn't eat it. It wasn't what I wanted. When I 
239 looked up again, the man who had prepared it was gone. I carefully put the 
240 bowl down on the metal table and headed out of kitchen. Again I found
241 myself at the door facing the window. 
242      I enjoyed the outside show. Out there life and death struggles were 
243 going on. Moment to moment activities were deciding the fate of the
244 vegitation and animals. Out there was reason and purpose, a sense of 
245 existance. Back in the ballroom the mindless group stuffed themselves with 
246 food and drink, speaking of nothing of such great import as life and death. 
247 Hiding away from the world outside, sunk into the mindless trap of the 
248 protection offered by the safe secure walls provided by the hotel. 
249      They did not know what was going on outside, they did not want to 
250 know. There was no reason to leave the safety of this artifical womb.

261 an the X-1 started to stall.  I fought it with the control wheel for about five
262 hundred feet, and finally got her nose down.  The moment we picked up speed I
263 fired all four rocket chambers in rapid sequence.  We climbed at .88 Mach and
264 began to buffet, so I flipped the stabilizer switch and changed the setting two
265 degrees.  We smoothed right out at 36k feet, I turned off two rocket chambers.
266 At 40k feet, we were still climbing at a speed of .92 mach...I noticed that 
267 the faster I got,the smoother the ride.
268     Suddenly the mach needle began to fluctuate.  It went up to .965 mach-then
269 went right off the scale!!  I thought I was seeing things!!  We were flying

333 The government has launched a two pronged attack on Oregon's
334 marijuana smokers.
335 
336 By sending US troops to stop the flow of mariguana from outside
337 the country, along with the new federal crack down on the
338 Oregon marijuana industry, Oregon's dope smokers could be in
339 serious trouble.
340 
341 We are basically facing the same situation we had with the oil
342 imbargo. There will be a crisis, real or imagined. Dealers will
343 hoard their supplies until the prices go up. Then they'll
344 unload at outrageous prices. The consumer screwed again.
345 
346 So-so quality dope could end up going for $500 an ounce, or
347 more. It could force people to choose between giving up dope
348 all together or going to a cheaper, riskier, drug.
349 
350 Which do you think most of them will choose?
351 
352 Then again, this could be a blessing for some of us who have
353 a love/hate relationship with the cannabis weed anyway. It
354 could be real helpful for people who wanted to quit.
355 
356 The easiest time to give up drugs is when you can't get any
357 anyway. With no decision to make, you're less likely to make
358 the wrong one. The only trick is to stay away once the bitch
359 goddess returns.

365 Leonard - Well said.  I teach Economics at a high school once a week, and in 
366 discussions of our economic system, our governmental system was talked about.
367 On inquiry, not one person in the classroom new what type of government we
368 had, including the regular teacher.  
369 
370 "Democracy is the continued delusion that more than half of the people are 
371 right more than half of the time."  -- Author unknown (to me)
372 
373 Riskers - VOL is fine, Please list your colors - mine is black.  Pick a
374 Saturday to start, these things usually go on for a while.  French rules ?
375 Then nuclear ?  I will still drink D.P., to keep my head clear.
376 
377 All - Was everyone satisfied with the outcome of the elections ?  I see that
378 the Anti abortion people lost out to reason and sanity.  (Perhaps, since they
379 insist on calling pro choice to be pro abortion, we should call the the pro-
380 poverty, pro-child abuse, and pro-mental illness people, since what they are
381 advocating engenders all of the above at times.)
382 Grass was defeated.  Though not a user, I think it should have passed.
383 The convention center is in.  Maybe Wescon can come here one of these years.
384 Bob Koch beat Margaret Strachan.  Good, in my opinion.  We need to stop 
385 inviting the homeless here.  What about those of us who have homes ?  D
386 not also have rights ?
387 Property tax limitations were all defeated.  I do get tired of people with lots 
388 of property, but little income (read mostly old people) feeling that those of
389 us with an income should support their services.  Perhaps they don't have 
390 children, but an uneducated person is a drain on all society, not just on
391 parents.
392 All the "Nook you lar" issues were voted down.  Who says money can't buy 
393 happiness.  Consider the case of PGE.  Wow.
394 Last, and probably least, the race to see who will be the invisible state
395 executive for the next four to eight years.  Did any of you know that Vic
396 Atiyeh died two years ago, and they have been using a gient muppet for state
397 functions since ?  So how effective can the Governor be?

415      Yes, it is true that we are a republic.  However, it should be noted that
416 centralization is the other extreme to anarchy and should be avoided just the
417 same.  And we were only formed as a republic with the understanding that a
418 'bill of rights' would be ammended to the Constiution to assure that the
419 central government would not have too much power.  Remember, we had just gone
420 through a war with a government that was a great distance away.  The people
421 didn't want to give the new government too much power.

425 hazardous substances in the area, but these measures were either too vague or
426 too pointed to be of much use.

451 Leonard, while it is true that the typical methode of removal from office
452 that the people are disatisfied with is via the election process, it is
453 far from the only way. There are several others that are as effective.
454 The next most common being via resignation of the individual themself.
455 This is a result of peer pressure. It is unsaid, but comes in the form of
456 get out or we'll kick you're butt out. So by leaving quietly they can 
457 often resurface again elsewhere, or find a nice cushy job in the private
458 sector through the contacts they made while holding the public office.
459 The other methode of removal is brought on as a result of them not leaving
460 on their own, and is called a recall. When the screwup is big enough this 
461 often occurs. But usually the individual is forced to resign before things
462 go that far. There is one other rather extreme way that has been used to
463 remove indiviuals from public office that someone has deemed should be done,
464 though usually it isn't because the individual has been doing things rather
465 badly. In fact usually it is just the opposite. The popularity of the individual
466 brings on the phsycotics who feel that they can make themself be heard by
467 killing the individual. But regardless of the emotion behind the action, it
468 does rather effectively remove them from office... (though there have been
469 a few cases now and then of a dead person holding office for various reasons.
470 Though of course it is usually short lived. Besides the office can get a bit
471 smelly after a few days...
472 Be that as it may, what we do elect are normally leaders, people who tell us
473 what they are going to have the people they appoint do (whether they actually 
474 have them do it or not). We seldom have a say in regard to the individuals 
475 that actually do the work. But then that is a part of why the system works
476 resonably well despite the continued movement of the leaders. Normally the 
477 doers are left to do their jobs, and the leaders just stand around and try
478 to look impressive. 
479 I do have a few disagreements with the setup though. I feel that the judicial
480 system could use some work. The revolving door that we have set up for the
481 criminals is one example of a system that is in dire need of realignment.
482 I also have a disagreement with the higher court appointment structure. One 
483 indiviual can determine the appointments and thus the direction of legal 
484 interpritation for many years to come, whether that is in the desire of
485 the majority or not. This tends to a lot of needless and time wasting battles
486 between the legislature and judicial branches (as if there weren't enough
487 battles with the executive branch already). I feel that the rule by agression
488 is not the best way. And I feel the same way about the court system. I know
489 that that flys in the face of what everyone is taught, about how great the
490 legal system we have is. But I say in response "Bull Shit!" it is not that
491 great. The only real winners are the lawers. But then I admit I'm prejudice
492 in the matter after having a lawer try to get me to sue someone for moneys
493 owed despite the fact that I could never recover anywhere near the cost it
494 would take to sue him, (if I got anything at all). I remember quit well the
495 mechinasations he used to try to get me mad at the other person so that I would
496 sue (so that of course he could take on the case). I wasn't mad, I was only
497 interested in my options I had legally. No, I do not agree that agression
498 is the best way to solve problems, and I think the current state of the
499 inssurance industry proves that there is something drasticlly wrong.
500 The one major change I would make is that the loser would have to pay *both*
501 lawer's fees as well as the court costs (instead of just court costs as it
502 is now.) This should cause those who like to sue a lot to think twice, and
503 give incentive to those being sued to fight it instead of just settling out
504 of court because it is cheaper, thus causing the people who like to sue to
505 take a third think at it, and so on. I think that one change would make
506 a significant change in the current problem area.

556 Maybe I can do a lot to clear up the mists of these laudatories. Our
557 constitution is set up  with a regulated system of checks and balances.
558 Which is now a democratic system. With all people equals in the strength of
559 the vote. As Democritus would have wished, perhaps. Which is the single
560 best measure of a democracy that I can figure out.
561 It is a republic in that the vote of the people, their democracy, is handed
562 over to representatives. As per my rather luxurious dictionary.
563 Did you know that the Democratic-Republican Party, against a strong central
564 government, was renamed in 1828 to the Democratic Party?
565 It was. And this illustrates that democracies and republics are not
566 mutually exclusive. So, please, stop trying to show your enlightenment by
567 telling the Democrats or the Republicans here that they are wrong. Try to
568 incorporate their ideas. It works well here...

    "Oh my lord Jesus" were the first words Sister Marianne

615 
first she thought him only a dead animal, but as she passed, she 
616 
noticed that there was no hair on the entire corpse.
617      Sister Marianne slammed on the brakes and pulled over to the 
618 
side. She took a blanket from the trunk of her car, with which to 
619 p the dead child in.  As the Sister neared, she prayed to God 
620 to forgive the poor soul who had done this
621      The baby was a horrible sight to look upon.  Blood and 
622 grime covered his small body and a dark greenish fluid oozed from 
623 his still-attached umbilical cord.  The child's hands were 
624 
clenched into tiny fists.  His face was contorted in an emotion 
625 that he had not yet learned.
