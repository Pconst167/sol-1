23 MIKE MAXSON (known to the BW as "PHOENIX"):
24   A reply to your questions:
25 a) "I am working on my own BBS hope to finnish it real soon what do you 
26   think of this????" [un-caps mine]
27    Well, Mr. Maxson, I can only say that I am overjoyed. With any luck, your
28   duties as SYSOP (such as removing "MASG"'s of the quality you leave here
29 from your system) will keep you sufficiently busy (and entertained) to 
30 remove, or at least detain you from OUR system. Good luck.
31 
32 b) "Ive been on this board for a few days now, what do you think of 
33 PHOENIX??????????????????????" [un-caps mine]
34    As far as I'm concerned, Mr. Maxson, PHOENIX can find another round, warm
35 "PLANT" to take over. With ATARI in hand. Good day.
36 
37 An after-thought, Mr. Maxson. "I did not mean to make people hate me.  I just
38 wanted to play along with the users??????"  I truly feel sorry for you. You
39 have an unpleasant, failure-ridden life ahead; I sincerly hope that you can
40 muster what little intellect you have and attempt to modify your rather 
41 warped perspective of what people consider acceptable behavior before you 
42 lose whatever chance you have for a reasonable facsimile of a normal life.
43  As to "From now on I will be trying to leave good information about 
44 computers, modems, BBS, and world news.", please, Mr. Maxson, leave it on
45 another system. (Preferably PMS) Thank you.

60 rather slow...dreadfully slow. Perhaps you guys should get a
61 conspiracy going to add a little direction. Too bad Mohammed

76 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
77 Voyeur was bored.  Bored, bored, bored.  All his old friends, Bard, Piper, apprentice, Man in Gray, Mad Actor, all seemed
78 to be involved in activities of their own, and didn't visit the Inn much any more.  All that was left, it seemed, was a
79 lot of juveniles and their pet gerbils and hamsters.  "Well", he thought,"maybe a game of solitaire."  He dug into his pack,
80 and pulled out a soggy mass of cardboard. "Drat! I'm going to have to talk to White Stag about their waterproofing."  Making
81 enquiries, he discover that no one else in the Inn had a deck they were willing to loan.  'Guess it's time to check out that
82 store down the road.'  He strolled down the road for a while, until he came to a building from which hung a sign:
83 'Ye Olde Shoppe of Ye Antiquities and Ye Curiosities'.
84 'Stuff was probably new when they started making that sign' he thought to himself, noting its length.  Entering, he had to 
85 pause while his eyes adjusted to the dimness, and to wipe the cobwebs from his face. Looking around, he spied a wizened old
86 man with bright eyes, grinning at him from behind a dusty, battered counter.  "Don't hurt me pets, now" he cackled as Voyeur
87 pulled a wandering spider from beneath his jerkin. The old man continued "don't git many cust'mers here any more, since the
88 accident."  "What accident", Voyeur questioned, when the old man stopped.  "Eh?  Oh, never mind.  My mind was wandering.
89 Getting old, you know.  So, is there something I can find for you, or are you just here to see where it happened?".  "Where
90 WHAT happened?"  The old man didn't answer.  "Well, I was wondering if you might have a deck of cards I could buy."  The old
91 mans eyes gleamed.  "Cards?  Why, I do believe I have some here somewheres."  He disappeared into the back of the shop for a
92 while, then finally returned, brushing the dust from something in his hand.  "I acquired these quite some time ago" he said,
93 handing them to Voyeur.  He went on with some story about princes and feuds, Voyeur listening with half an ear while he 
94 inspected the cards.  'That old fool!  These are Tarot cards!' he thought.  'But what exquisite workmanship!'  The covers
95 had a picture of a unicorn facing left, rearing back.  He thumbed through the cards, until he came to the Greater Trumps.
96 They were Cold, bearing the images of real-seeming people.  He studied one.  It was of a man with black hair, green eyes,
97 dressed in silver and black, with a clasp at his neck in the form of a silver rose.  The more Voyeur studied the card, the
98 more lifelike the image became.  Suddenly it moved and spoke.
99 "Who is it?"  Voyeur stood frozen, until the figure reached Out, took his hand, and pulled him through.

231 screen, but that would sound too much like Tron (listening Aaron?) What about
232 one of the "johns" at PSU actually being a mult-demensional time-space vortex
233 in disguise? Naw... I know...

235 The drive out to Tek would be a boring one for sure...Except for the
236 mild excitement at the 217 interchange. But wait...what's this guy in the
237 Mazda here next to me trying to do? Maybe this guy wants to race??? Well I'll
238 give this guy a chase that would make Gene Hackman proud. I always loved the
239 sound of 302 inches of hi-pro ported, pollished, balanced, and blueprinted
240 power come to life! The needle on the speedometer rose faster and faster.
241 70...80...90..100! But the guy in the mazda somehow seemed to be keeping up.
242 It was getting difficult to dodge the other cars that seemed to crawl along
243 at 60mph. Faster still...110...120...and still this mysterious mazda seemed
244 to keep up. Past Big Reds we flew...Past the interchange...Murry...Cornell...
245 Ocean Beaches sign...on and on, yet I couldn't shake him. 130 was the speed
246 now...how much longer could he stay at this speed?!? Suddenly, he tore past
247 me as if I was standing still. Visions of Knight Rider danced in my head,
248 but that's a TV show. I saw the face of the other driver...what a strange
249 look...almost a smile, but those eyes......
250 Those eyes...
251 I am not quite sure what happened next. It might have been a pothole, or maybe
252 a piece of tire from one of the big semi's..but whatever...I seemed to have
253 lost control of my car, but the car wasn't out of control. It was almost as
254 if the car were being influenced by some forces Detroit never dreamed of...
255 The next thing that made any sense was finding myself driving again, but
256 now totally alone, over a strange landscape. The speed was much less, but my
257 speedometer was not registering at all. In fact, the only way I could tell
258 my speed was less was due to the sound of the engine. Even the tach was out.
259 I was moving, no doubt about that, but where was I going. I had a feeling
260 my handy city of portland road map wouldn't get me out of this. I better
261 stop and get some sense of what is going on. And where is that driver in
262 the Mazda???

264 PS I realize this isn't the usual way to get into a story, but voyeur, Milchar,

311  PHOENIX: Well, maybe I went just a little (tiny tiny) bit overboard. 
312  HAWTHORNE: **PLEASE** set the system margin at 76 with the "MA 76" command,
313 and procede to type until eithier (if you have a bell) the margin beeper
314 beeps, or (if you don't) the system stops echoing your characters. Edit
315 your messages to remove typos. Find some way to make you machine comm in
316 LOWER CASE. 
317  ALL: Yes, I know. MiG chides me with a long-forgotten document (my "come
318 on people now, smile on your brother....everybody get together learn to 
319 love one another right now" text of a few years back, from one of BW's less
320 savory disks... and times.. I was playing Jesse Jackson) and I can 
321 remember (long pause....well, just ONCE......or twice..) when I left mess-
322 ages containing somewhat less than topical or relevant material. (with 
323 attendant gramatical and spelling "liberties".....ONCE) 
324       I want BW to be a "nice" place to visit.  These periods of upheavel
325 always pass, but in their passing take something with them...perhaps
326 someone decides that BW is no longer a worth their time; true, we lose
327 some users and in the same breath another "BOO! I'M NEW" (how PAM intro-
328 duced herself) appears on our disks. This does not change; users come and
329 go; but, like flowers, no two are alike, we are poorer when we lose a rose,
330 even if that day we find a lily. Has anyone seen the Dragon Lady recently?
331 Colonel Batgauno? Mike Bigham? They all still have computers, modems, live
332 in Portland, (well, I havn't talked with Mike for a while) and no longer
333 frequent the BW. We lose every time a potential user decides that "BW
334 is just a bunch of kids playing with modems" upon spying "MOB RULES"
335 splayed across their screen, or when a "premium no-lead" simply can't
336 access the system because the line is tied up by undesireables entering
337 100 lines of "WRITTING", or a Mike or a Denise or a Pamela finds their
338 messages adultrated one too many times...and doesn't call back. We lose.
339        BW has had golden times; everyone can remember when the magic "works"
340 and a disk is a mystical tapestry woven of loveingly spun fibers.. of a
341 different world than p-n junctions and magnetic domains. A world of beauty,
342 of mystery....of magic!    Then, of course, are BW's tin times..the system
343 is little more than random bubbles of ego, floating in a sea of self, bursting
344 as if never having been. Our world is reduced to phase hits, 103A, and 
345 weather or not someone is using MA 76.
346        I believe we have a choice. I beleive we can prolong our "golden
347 times", and eliminate our tin ones. ("I have a dream....") Individually,
348 we are helpless. Collectivly, we are strong. No one would vandalize a system
349 if they knew it would put an end to their telecomputing days in Portland, 
350 that they would be caught, exposed.. Everyone would strive to do their best,
351 be the MOST creative, make the FEWEST spelling errors, if they were using
352 a system that was, unquestionably, THE BEST, MOST RESPECTED system in the
353 state. OUR SYSTEM.  
354        Well, I've had my say, vented my spleen at Phoenix (and subjected
355 all of you to my Negative Vibes in the process), and generally wasted a lot
356 of disk space. Comments?

369 Aaron--when you are not arguing religion, you can produce some rather
370 nice writing.  Why not try your hand at one of the adventures?
371 ????
372 Well, Milchar, since you are the only one responding to my quizes, I might
373 as well address it to you.  You got the last one correct, so here's 
374 another one, set on a neighboring island.
375 On this island, the whites get sunburned to the same shade as
376 the natives, so the only way to tell them apart is thus: Islanders
377 always lie (of course) and the 'whites' alway tell the truth.

379 all the same color.  He asks "are you white people burned brown, or are
380 you islanders?"  The first oe calls out something that is lost in the sound
381 of the surf, so the man shouts out his question again.  This time the 
382 second man on the beach calls back, saying "The first person who answered
383 said he is a white man, and he IS a white man, and so am I."  The third
384 person on the beach calls out "The first two people here on the beach 
385 are islanders and I am a white man burned brown."

389 Grand D.:  There is no conspiracy, no group of cronies & insiders plotting to exclude others from the tales. I
390 was making a slightly facetious commenton how the last adventure started. What I was trying to say was "somebody
391 get the ball rolling". I'll agree, the last one was lacking in pace, but taken as segments there were some good
392 things written. Now we need to practice our pacing. Care to show us how?

395 (I'd still like some info on the Ruby Valley so there can be some coherence, or is it strictly a figment {haven't seen
396 Fig lately, come to think of it})
397 Voyeur found himself in what appeared to be a library.  Books covered the walls, and there was a glass cabinet off 
398 to one side containing several decks of cards similar to the one which had brought him here.  He was interrupted in his
399 review by the man in silver and black.  "I am Corwin, Lord of Amber.  Who are you, and where are you from?"  Voyeur
400 stammered "I am Voyeur, that is, I am Called Voyeur, because of, well, uh," he felt his face grow hot, which increased
401 his embarrassment.  He hurried on "I am from Innisfall, the Backwater Inn, and..." he went on to tell how he arrived
402 in Amber.  As he spoke, Corwin grew thoughtful.  "Innisfall, eh?  From your description, this CISTOP MIKEY sounds like
403 a shadow of a shadow of one of my brothers.  Possibly Gerard, probably Random.  His powers indicate that he must have
404 a fair amount of the blood of the House of Amber.  As must you, Voyeur, to be able to manipulate the Trumps.  Your name
405 puts me in mind of Random also. Tell me of your ancestry."  As Voyeur began relating his family tree, Corwin suddenly
406 held up his hand, and got a faraway look in his eyes.  Then he turned his attention to Voyeur and said "your coming
407 seems to have opened gates which have been closed for some time.  Do you know this newcomer?"  A picture began forming
408 in Voyeurs mind.  He saw a car, a Mustang, floating through the air over a forest, and as the image grew sharper and
409 focused in on the errant vehicle, he recognized a familiar face behind the wheel.  "L'homme!  L'homme sans parity!
410 What is He doing here?"  "That's what I'd like to know" responded Lord Corwin, darkly.
411 ::::::::
412 Actually, L'homme, if we were to get in a race, if I Did get in front of you, you Would be lost.  Lost in great clouds
413 of blue smoke from the quart of oil I burn every 120 miles.  And Hey!  This is Backwater!  There is no Right way to 
414 get involved.  Your method was as good as any and better than most.  I certainly enjoyed it.  (inside jokes help a bit,
415 of course)

417 All: how's my 120 character lines look? I like them, since my 64 character screen makes two proper lines out of it

421    Far from the inn, in a lonely glade by a swiftly running stream, the piper 
422 sat upon a large rock.  His pipes were dissasembled and laying in the grass
423 before him, his head bent over, and his face wore an intent expression.  He held
424 a yellow tube about three inches in diameter and about 4 inches long in one 
425 hand and an exceedingly sharp knife in the other.  Never faltering in his
426 concentration, he pared a tiny sliver off the tounge of still another bass
427 drone reed.  Placing the tube in his mouth, he blew a raucous cawwww, then 
428 smiled faintly.  Perhaps now he could escape this self-imposed prison and
429 rejoin his old companions at the inn.  He straightened and a circle of gold
430 shaped as a serpent biting its own tail swung from his neck.  He pressed the
431 newly trimmed reed into the bottom of the drone, assembled the stand of pipes
432 and swung them to his shoulder.  With the first few notes, he knew he was in 
433 deep trouble.  The golden torc pulsed alarm as some force took hold of him and
434 left only a fading impression of a greyish stain laced with scarlet and gold in
435 the air of the deserted glade.

438 Quizmaster:The man who wasn't heard was a white burned brown, as the second
439 man (who truthfully said that the first had said "I am a white") did tell the
440 truth.  Therefore he is also white.  The Third man is an Islander, as he lied
441 about both of the other answers.

443 Wind rushed by the two adventurers as the "Flying Mat" took them to Amber.
444 The great expanse of the city was before them, as they were quite close now.
445 The sparkling city below made Milchar very glad he decided to come, but he
446 also was grieved by events that were soon to come.
447 Milchar steered the mat to hover above the Glen of the Unicorn, as he summoned
448 all of his will to pass to the real one.  The pain increased as he fought,
449 and just before Milchar couldn't stand it any olonger, they were through.
450 The area that they were now in seemed almost identical to where they were...
451 but seemed DIFFERENT somehow.  Everything was sharper, more real. "If I 
452 hadn't have had mental training, I would have never been able to manipulate
453 Shadow so close to Amber.  Now to find Dworkin."
454 The mat lazily flew about a quarter of a mile to the seashore, where an
455 enourmous expanse of rock was etched with a strange spiral-like design, which
456 glowed with silverly light as they landed.  The mat, in a guesture of exhaustion
457 , promptly disintergrated when they landed. "Poor spell.  I hardly ever work
458 wthem that hard." Milchar finds a tunnel dug into solid rock, and gestures 
459 Traveller inside.

462 Mad Actor: Good God...I hope I didn't sound that paranoid. I 
463 never said I thought there was a conspiracy to exclude anyone.
464 If anything I was expressing my frustration. Mostly it comes 
465 down to missing the work of Mike Bigham.
466 
467 I've found that certain contributions to the Inn are easier to 
468 relate to than others. The great discs are the ones where
469 members really clicked with one anothers styles and 
470 contributions. I've found that my style clicks more often with 
471 Mikes' than with anyone elses. I really miss Mohammed and 
472 Serena. I haven't found any adventure that inspires me like 
473 theirs.
474 
475 But who knows? Maybe someday someone will hit on something that
476 I can really get my teeth into. It's that hope that causes me 
477 to at least remain a lurker when nothing good is going on.
478 
479 I'm taking my computer in to get a disc drive installed which 
480 means I won't be around for awhile. Don't do anything 
481 interesting while I'm gone. Grand D.

494 Before the figure could reply to the apprentice's query, reality {BLINK}ed once
495 more. When the bard glanced around, he discovered that the apprentice & the
496 prairie cat were no longer with him. He decided to worry about that later as
497 he suddenly realized that he KNEW where he was...
498 There ought to be a hidden supply cache in that ruined department store....
499 ....Later after repairing/replacing much of his equipment, he was ready to 
500 start back to the inn. But first, a test of the new scanner. What's this -
501 traces converging on Amber? This bears checking out! 
502 He replaced the scanner & took out another device. Any observer must 
503 have been very bewildered. This new device did not bear close scrutiny. Imagine,
504 if you will, a cross between a 3-D analogue of a blivit, a Klien flask & a
505 tesseract. This will give you some idea of the kind of mayhem the opener wreaked
506 on normal eyes! 
507 He triggered the opener. A hatch opened in mid-air, beyond was visible
508 a service tunnel of some sort, running at right angles to the hatch. Strange 
509 boxes, conduits & the like covered the walls and floor. The bard stepped through
510 the hatch. As it closed he muttered, "Shouldn't be more than a million miles or
511 so... God I *HATE* walking!"
512 The hatch vanished.
513 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
514 I'll answer a couple of questions in advance. No, I haven't gotten into a ship. 
515 Yes, I am going to WALK a million or so miles. You rembember the "holes" in 
516 "Time Bandits"? This is sort of a hi-tech analogue. Inter-universal service 
517 passages. Alteco uses 'em, but I never got an answer when I asked who BUILT 
518 them.....

530 Here we are, all converging on Amber.  Most of the Innhabitants are as
531 starved for a good m.a. story as I am.  It reminds me of the beginning
532 of the Kolumbia Disaster.  I hope we have better luck on this one.  Does
533 anyone have any real idea what is going on? We need a real live honest
534 to goodness GOAL, else we'll just mill around in Amber for a while until
535 Corwin gets tired of us and invites us to explore Chaos.  (I just wish
536 the books were fresher in my mind, but there's no way I'm going to get
537 the 900 or so pages reread in time to be useful.  Doesn't really matter,
538 I guess. Not everyone seems to be as interested in following the setting
539 as closely as I tried to.  'Openers' indeed!)

541 Upon reflection, I realize that my greeting to L'homme is rather at

547 Whisper was sitting by herself in the field writing in her book of 
548 of curiosities when there was a sudden rush of displaced air and  a
549 mild BAMPH. Looking up she spied the apprentice and a large green eyed
550 cat. Is that the kind of cat I think it is. I've only come across them 
551 mentioned once and that was in my copy of the BOOK OF SAGES, she said to
552 the apprentice. I do wish that book hadn't had the index torn out of it
553 before I found it. I can never find anything twice in the thing! I'm 
554 sure I saw some mention of the Ruby valley in it but i don't remember 
555 the page number or what was said. Let me get my armor on and lets go.

594 The mazda was certainly no where in sight, but I had bigger problems to worry
595 about at the moment. My normally fine tuned high output engine was making
596 sounds that would make Carol Shelby turn in his grave! "But I just tuned this
597 beast!" I said to myself. "What could be wrong now???" I was still moving
598 at a relatively high rate of speed, although no where near the speed I had
599 achieved back on the Sunset. Ah yes...the Sunset...was has happned to
600 Portland? What has happened to Tektronix, my original destination? And why the
601 heck am I here???
602 At first I wasn't sure if it was some distortion due to the heat, or if
603 it was real, but as I drew closer...yes...some kind of city...Well at least
604 there is some kind of civilizaion here. The engine was starting to miss
605 now...I cringed when I thought of the damage all of this might do to those
606 beautiful 13:1 molly pistons I just had put in. Stuck out here with no idea
607 of where I am is not my idea of fun at a Saturday Concourse. If I can just
608 nurse my car into that city...what ever it is, maybe I can get some help
609 with my car. I was getting closer now, but finally the engine just gave up.
610 No amount of manual choke adjustment would help. It was as dead as a flat-6
611 air cooled corvair on a hot summer day. "Well it looks as if I'll have quite
612 a long walk into town". But for some strange reason, beyond my 15 hours of
613 General Physics I had taken my Sophomore year at PSU, my 2600lbs car kept
614 on rolling, as if defying friction, and taking Newton totally to heart! I 
615 couldn't explain it, but if it was going to spare me a long walk, I am not
616 going to complain. As I rolled into the outskirts of town, I thought to myself,
