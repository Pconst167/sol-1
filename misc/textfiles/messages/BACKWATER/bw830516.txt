33 Answer to cry for help above:
34 	This system most strongly resembles a Cuisinart.  All the messages
35 get mooshed up together, butted up against each other.  It is far more
36 anonymous, indeed it is closer to a true 'electronic bulletin board' than
37 the systems with similar functions.
38 	So jump right in, the water's fine.  No comment is too off-the-wall,
39 no idea is too looney  (if you could see some of the backup disks, you'd
40 know what I mean).
41 	The average user of this system is happiest discussing politics,
42 religion, modems and baud rates, programming languages, and microprocessor
43 fundamentals.  I don't know which of these topics is the most controversial.;,
44 but make a strong comment on any or all and most likely the electronic s**t

56   There are often severe problems associated with using telephone modems
57 on radio circuits (HF).  Phone modems are set up for a circuit that changes
58 level minimally or at least very slowly.  This is certainly far from the
59 case on any HF circuit using the ionosphere for propogation.  There is
60 seldom any significant interference on the telephone, nor is there usually
61 the very pronounced multipath problems with two nearly equal signals
62 arriving with considerable delay between them.  (How would you like to 
63 try to decide between two signals with one sending '1' and the other a
64 '0' at the same time?)  
65   These are some of the reasons that most HF radio systems run at slow
66 data rates (74.2 baud is FAST!).  It is also why Baudot codes are used
67 (only five bits per character gives more characters per second with
68 the same baud).
69   Regarding AFSK (or even APSK), there is a significant S/N penalty
70 compared to direct FSK or direct PSK when using standard AM or FM with
71 full carrier.  You can recover the penalty by using higher transmitter
72 power if you aren't bothered by the cost (or the law!).  Using SSBSC
73 is really just a way of translating the audio signal directly to a
74 higher frequency, so it works just fine for data transmission, if
75 you ignore the other problems that mother nature throws at you...
76 {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} Analog Alan {}{}{}{} 27 Apr 83 PM {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}
77 There is an even better reason why baudot is common: up until very recently
78 it was illegal for hams to use ascii, so it is still new. The slow rates
79 are more the result of cheap, obsolete equipment, and is rapidly changing.
80 But, as you say, radio is different. Or is it? There are bulletin boards
81 on the 2 meter band, just like on landline.
82    I see the Val Gal is back; greetings and lets hear more of it.
83 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~B.A.D.~~~~~~~APR 27~~~~~~~~
84 I have seen a lot of AFSK stuff running around on the 2 meter bands,
85 as well as others in that vicinity. Also it is not all data transmission
86 as we know it. There is an awfull lot of tone encoding going on for 
87 repeater access and other restricted things. These signals are being
88 generated by touch tone equipment being thrown out as AFSK on FM bands.
89 Why? because its cheap and available and it works. It has nothing to do
90 with whether it is the best engineering way to do it (especially since
91 it isn't!)  You probably won't see much high speed stuff on the HF bands
92 not because it can't be done, but rather because there is not enough 
93 space alocated to do it along with all the other trafic down there .
94 Most (if not all) of the lower bands are already taken by voice and CW
95 anyway, and those that are being used by RTTY are far too narrow for
96 any kind of speed no matter what method of modulation you use.
97 The high bands use FM because its all line of sight anyway, so you
98 might as well do an easy way (the other common method is SSB, AM has
99 been falling out of favour because of its increadibly waste of power
100 for almost no signal strength. FM while being nearly as wastefull as 
101 AM has a better signal to noise ratio and is perfered over the much
102 more efficient SSB because it is cheaper, and sounds better. SSB sounds
103 like a donald duck routine most of the time because of oscilator drift.)
104 The AFSK is used, because you just feed the signal into the aux input
105 and there is no equipment mods required to get it done as is often the
106 case with FSK or PSK. Remember, ease of implimentation is the prime
107 motivator, not whether it is the most perfect way to do it or not.
108 and AFSK is the easiest method to employ on most existing radio equipment.
109 Actualy, I have found that in most cases the reason given for do something
110 a certain way often has a base as an excuse for doing it the easiest way

240   One mention of the better signal to noise ratio of FM propagates a
241 common misconception.  For the same signal strength, the S/N on FM is
242 almost no different from AM.  The only time that FM gets the improvement
243 is when you use wide deviation (much more than +/- 5 kHz for VF) and 
244 when the signal is well above the improvement threshold.  At levels
245 below the equivalent FM threshold, AM is actually quieter!  The real
246 reason for FM on the mobile communication frequencies is that the
247 apparent audio level is constant, regardless of the signal strength.
248 You can use the good old limiter to provide constant level recovered
249 audio, while AM and AMssbsc requires a very well designed AGC system
250 for level control on receive.
251   For the person that said the only reason that hams don't use high
252 speed modems on HF was the lack of clear bandwidth... I challenge 
253 you to send 2400 bps on any HF circuit over 200 miles, regardless
254 of the rules and with negligible QRM.  It should only take 3 kHz
255 bandwidth, which isn't so much.  Try it on 80 meters around 3600
256 at 11 PM local time; the QRM is minimal.  I bet you can't even 
257 recover the clock!
258 {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{} Analog Alan {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}
259 Actually it has been done. admittedly only at 1200 baud, but then
260 that is the fastest 'standard' AFSK modem made. Really, it is quite 
261 simple to do . First you do not do SSB this is a major mistake as
262 it corrupts the signal so badly its amazing that voice gets thru
263 let alone data. While the phone company manages to do rather well
264 with SSB, they have to go to some rather expensive extremes to
265 get it done. As it is their main reason for even doing it is to
266 save bandwidth space. As power and uncontroled conditions they can
267 get around. I degress here, sorry. Any way since SSB is out what we
268 have left of the standard methods of modulating is AM or FM.
269 AM is also out because while it is more stable then SSB on the typical
270 transmitter, it is far more suceptible to the type of noises that 
271 modems don't like. This leaves us with FM which although is far from
272 perfect it the best we got. The next thing we have to worry about
273 is the modem. We cannot use the 103 type modem, as it is a narrow shift
274 modem, and is suceptible to noise variance. Nor can we use the slightly 
275 less common high speed modems such as the bell 201 (2400 baud) modem as
276 these modems use phase shift to encode the data for transmission, and
277 since the HF bands tend to shift the phase of the signal rather heavily
278 this type of encoding is out. If we were to build our own high speed
279 modem that used FSK instead, then we could handle it. finally the modem
280 needs to be a wide shift type FSK modem such as the 202 modem. This 
281 reduces the noise interference problem to a minimum. The method of
282 modulating the signal on the FM is not really important, since data 
283 signals are constant level there is really no effective difference between
284 AFSK or FSK as we would be transmitting at 100% modulation in either case.
285 As such we used AFSK since it was easier to connect to the radio.  
286 Now comes the important part, many hams expect the signal to get thru
287 with no corruption at all. This is a wholly unrealistist attitude, after
288 all if the high speed stuff can't get thru as good a connection as the
289 phone line what makes them think it can get thru the air waves unmolested?
290 As such we use a packet transmission system so as to be able to retransmit
291 those pieces of data that get mangled. Also I might note that while
292 you can get by with only a 3000Hz bandwidth to xmit the 2400 baud signal
293 via SSB, you will need better then 2X the rate to xmit via AM or FM.
294 Them's simply the rules of the game. 
295 As a parting comment, I still hold that ease of design is the prime
296 factor in the design of most equipment. This is because engineering 
297 time is expensive, and you can't aford to spend months designing a
298 piece of gear that you will only sell a couple hundred of at horribly
299 narrow profit margins. Life doesn't work like that.
300 ..... the exwarior ..............................................
301   I agree with your comments.  After all, laziness is a very strong 
302 motivating force!  And you are certainly right that the standard ham
303 SSB transmitter has neither the required bandwidth nor the necessary
304 linearity to do an adequate job of sending high speed data.  The 
305 equalization used in the slower synchronous modems (201) usually can
306 only handle the group delay that is typical of a telephone channel, and
307 the narrow transmitter a-n-d receiver filters in ham gear add much more
308 group delay than a transcontinental terrestrial microwave link with all
309 of the required channel filters.
310   High speed FSK or AFSK modems will also have problems with the phase
311 instability of HF paths (2400 bps and up) since there is a duality of
312 the phase and frequency modulation techniques.  Even at 1200 bps, the
313 net data rate with packet transmission or other error correction 
314 methods will drop off drastically due to numerous retransmissions.  It
315 will be true that there is an optimum data rate with error correction
316 that will provide the maximum throughput on a given channel.  Either
317 higher or lower data transmission rates will degrade the actual amount
318 of data per unit time.

320 **************************
321 Get this:  I just read about a new laser diode which has been used to
322 transmit data over an optical fiber at 1G BPS.  That's right, 1,000,000,000
323 bits per second, equivalent to about 2  30-volume encyclopedias per second.
324 So don't give me any of this 1200 baud nonsense.
325 **************************
326 In order to get away from the phase shift problems due to ionosphere
327 fadeing, go to very high data rates, and send in short spurts. I admit
328 this leaves out the 80 meter ham band, but go to somewhat higher freqs
329 and use meteor trail scatter. (It's loaded with fade.) Most of the
330 time you can't use this, but when it's good, it's good; so send a pilot
331 signal from the receiving end, and when this gets through to the sender,
332 he sends a spurt of very fast data. Don't laugh, it works. Standard FSk
333 is still the best way to modulate, don't even bother with audio stuff
334 except very wideband FM.
335 
336 Now, for some interesting stuff. WOMEN. In case you haven't figured
337 it out, one of the main reasons why there are no ladies on BWMS, or
338 at least very few, it's because ther is nothing here of interest to

430 Some terminal programs confuse half/full duplex with echo/no echo.

492 From Pion:
493  
494    I don't work for any company. I'm just a novice programmer,
495 actually, and I come up with a bright idea every now and then.
496 
497    I'm using a Heathkit H-89 computer with two secondary drives,
498 a MX-80 printer with GRAFTRAX-80 installed and Hayes Smartmodem
499 300.

501    To John: As I said, I'm just a novice programmer and I only
502 do this in my spare time. I thank you for your offer, however.
503 If you have any features you think would be a good idea, I'd
504 be glad to listen.
505 
506    Thanks to all.

518    At first (and still on another system) I call myself
519 "The Pioneer." This is kind of a play on my middle name, "Dorian,"
520 which was the name of a group of pioneers somewhere way
521 back then. I don't mean "pioneers" as in Davy Crockett, I
522 mean WAY back then. I think they were Oriental, or at least
523 Asian.
524 
525    I got tired of signing "The Pioneer" at the end of every
526 message and decided it to shorten it to "Pion," as in the
527 particle. I don't know if this particle is real; I read about
528 it in a Sci-Fi book. (It probably isn't real.)
529 
530    I hope this answers your question. I prefer to keep my
531 entire name secret for unknown reasons, even to me. (This
532 was a joke.)

557 To Pion:
558 	Yes, 'pion' is a particle, originally called 'pi meson'.
559 Originally hypothesized in the thirties by Hideki Yukawa as the
560 particle which holds together the particles in nucleus of the 
561 atom.  Discovered, I believe, in the early fifties.

567 
568   The Bit Bucket BB system will go down tonight
569 (5/6/83) until Monday, 5/16/83.  This is required
570 because sysop is going on a business trip, and the
571 wife can't operate the system.  SO, I gotta take
572 it down.  System back up sometime 5/16, so "see"
573 all you regular BBBB callers then.
