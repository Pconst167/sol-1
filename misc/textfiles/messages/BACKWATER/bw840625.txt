111 Quizmaster: Not one, TWO AD&D games.  One on PCS (the more visible), and another on PMS.  To top it all off, I got 
112 a job programming for a small business, getting their act together, and on top of all that, the latest Network code 
113 is driving me bananas!  It's not only the code, my 'de-coder' programs (remember the rings?) buzz and spit back at

130      Dawn broke, and I decided to wake my companion.  I stood up
131 and gave him a good swift kick in the backside.  Slowly he arose.
132      "Why did you do that?" He declared.  I looked up at him.  Way
133 up.  Not that Salsman is that much taller than most people, just that
134 I'm alot shorter.  
135     I frowned.  Why do I put up with him, I asked myself.  Someday I just
136 might answer that question.  I remember the first morning I came upon
137 him.  The mighty fighter, the warrior supreme.  Crying because he was
138 just robbed blind the night before.  I hadn't the courage to tell him
139 I had done it, I just let him think I did him a good turn by finding
140 all of his stuff here and there.  I guess it was the way he acted after
141 he got his stuff back.  I guess it's just the fact that a puppy dog is
142 nice, but to have one that can talk and fight for you is even better.
143      "I'm hungry, Rabindranith," he moaned.  Hungry for him was bad
144 news for me.  "Don't worry, we'll be on our way for breakfast right after
145 my friend arrives."
146      "Are we going to have a visitor, Rabindranith?"  
147      "kind of,  I'm not sure if he'll arrive, but I'm sure that if he doesn't,
148 he'll send someone along."  With this guy, I was sure of this.  I knew he should
149 have been here by now.  then I looked up and gasped..................
150                   Rabindranith and Salsman

153 I hate emergencies.  I always hate emergencies. But the one's I hate most
154 are the one's I get involved in.  Passing through doors of this sort
155 wasn't the safest thing to do anyhow.  I floated for a bit longer than
156 I was expecting, then I left the gateway.  Then I started to worry, mostly
157 because I didn't feel any ground beneath my feet..............
158        But instead of the bone crushing thud I was expecting, there was
159 only a kind of WHOOMPH.  Looking down, I see that I was closer to my 
160 objective than I had realized.  "Rabindranith, so good to see you!"
161 He only groaned slightly.  "I hope you have more to say than that, you
162 really took a chance on getting a message through to me.
163      "It was nessesary.  Just wait till I tell you............."
164      Just then I noticed a large fellow with an even larger sword coming
165 my way,  I was beginning to make my usual jump for the running away, when
166 I heard my short friend yell, "Salsman!  Wait a sec,  this's the guy
167 we've been waiting for."  I could see that Rab wasn't in the best of 
168 intelectual company this time.  I sure hope he knew what he was doing.
169      I couldn't wait any longer. "The reason you called me.  I'm almost
170 afraid to ask, but I can only think of one reason you'd call."

185 SITTING AT A TABLE IN THE INN(I REALISE I AM TYPING IN UPPERCASE ONLY)
186 O.K. now where was I?
187 Sitting at a table in the Inn,Graymalkin was supprised to find a black robed man standing befor him.
188 In his usual quick fashion,Graymalkin had his knife out about 3 inches when he experienced the less then comfortable 
189 sensation of having his left nostril enlarged to 9/16ths '' by a ford stickshift.
190 After dropping his knife and sitting down. The Ninja releases hi
191 him,and gives him a small`envelope,then disappearing into the shaddows once more.
192 Looking about to find this black robed man again,Graymalkin only sees 2 indeviduals that
193 look different. One is drinking from a burger-thing star wars olass and the other is a
194 vertual entourage of phone company equipment,and he was wearing a shirt with the emblem
195 "TPC-we know who`you are"
196 Drinking some beer to combat the pain from having  his nose
197 threded.
198 Graymalkin opens the envelope and reads aloud in his best voice.
199 "The twit you seek know as 'teddy salad' is known in real life as...
200 (drums`come from nowhare,light comes`in)
201 Kent Wright and has a phone number of
202 626-2900. Realing`from the cheers of the patrons
203 Graymalkin looks first at the two men at the table,who are grinning. Then sees a fast shaddow leaving the Inn,
204 He could bairly see the chrome from a stick shift.

214 The Innkeeper continued to dose off in front of the Inn, while the magik 
215 that held the Inn continued to grow weaker allowing greater and longer 
216 glimpses of the bare bones from which it was made. As the Inn shuddered on 
217 the edge of disappearing altogether, a new aurora began to form and 
218 stablize the Inn once more. Through it all, the foot bridge remained as 
219 solid as ever, proclaiming the entrance to the Inn's grounds. Next to the 
220 Inn itself, the Rowan tree continued to flourish, the small fruits that 
221 ladden its branches grown ripe in the sun. As if in response to that, a 
222 slight 'BAMPH' sound occurs, and a figure appears near the Rowan tree. 
223 Pausing momentarily to look around as if tring to get bearings in a place 
224 that somehow seemed different then before, the figure soon spies the 
225 Innkeeper lazing in front of the Inn. A mischievous look comes to her eyes, 
226 and she slowly sneaks around to behind the Innkeeper so as to not let him 
227 be aware of her presence. Then coming up close to him, she simply says; 
228 "Boo." Looking over the edge of the roof of the Inn where he had landed, 
229 the Innkeeper looks down to see who would dare to disturb him thus. His 
230 eyes grow wide in recognition as he sees who the perpetrator was; "PAM!"
231 Unfortunatly, the Innkeeper wasn't paying very good attention to his 
232 position, as he immediatly tumbled off the roof to land rather awkwardly on 
233 the Ivy strewn ground in front of the Inn again. Looking up from his 
234 sprawed position on the ground, he says; "I'm afraid I am not making a very 
235 good welcoming impression to my favorite barmaid, I hope you'll forgive my 
236 clumsiness."

259 JUST AS HE HAD EXPECTED, PERSEPHONE WAS FURIOUS. "YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT YOU GOT THAT CLOSE, AND THEN LOST IT?, SHE 
260 SCREAMED. "GOBACK AND GET IT OR I'LL HAVE YOUR MEMORY PUT ON AN EPROM AND SENT TO ATARI".
261 LYSIAS WAS TEMPTED TO REFUSE, KNOWING THAT HE ALONE HAD THE KEY TO THE TIME WARP, BUT SHE COULD MAKE THINGS ROUGH FOR 
262 HIM, SO ONCE AGAIN HE ACQUIESCED. IF ONLY PLUTO HADN'T BOUGHT THAT NORTHSTAR---.
263 WHAT HE REALLY DREADED WAS NOT GOING AFTER THE "ROTHMAN" RUBY, BUT THE TEMPORARY CONFUSION, AND VULNERABILITY UPON 
264 EMERGING FROM THE TIME WARP. MOUTHING THE KEY, HE ONCE AGAIN FOUND HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE INN. DIZZY AT FIRST, HE STEAD
265 IED HIMSELF AGAINST A LAMPPOST. A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOLPE WERE ON THEIR WAY IN, AND HE WAITED FOR THEM, WONDERING WHAT THE
266 Y HHAD AGAINST ANCHOVIES. ALWAYS LIKED 'EM MYSELF, HE THOUGHT AS HE ENTERED THE INN.
267 HE TOOK A TABLE IN THE BACK, AND THOUGHT ABOUT THE RUBY. HE KNEW WHO IT REALLY WAS, THAT WAS TRAPPED INSIDE, AND HE KNEW
268 WHAT PERSEPHONE HAD PLANNED FOR HIM, AND IF SHE WERE TO SUCCEED THEN HE WOULD FIND HIMSELF IN A VERY POWERFUL POSITION, 
269 BUT HE DOUBTED THAT SHE COULD PULL IT OFF. THAT WIZARD THAT FREQUENTED THE INN DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE REALLY HAD. MAYBE 
270 THERE WAS A WAY TO ENLIST HIS HELP. THAT WAY, THEY ALL WOULD 
271 BENEFIT FROM THE POWER OF THE RUBY. LOOKING AROUND, HE DIDN'T SEE ANYONE THAT HE KNEW, SO HE ORDERED ANOTHER ALE, AND

273 L'homme was already bored with this new place. All of the old gang seemed to
274 be dispersed amid various activites, and it simply wasn't the same as it was
275 before in the last adventure. "What has happened to our group?", L'homme
276 questioned himself. "Why do these things ALWAYS happen?" "Bard and voyeur
277 hadn't been seen for quite some time. Snow runner was off in the woods
278 somewhere with the other animals, Dream Toucher had met with some others
279 he had known before he hooked up with our group and was busy with them, and
280 the piper had departed for an extended vacation by himself. Habitrail Harry
281 hadn't been seen ever since we had arrived back at the Inn, and the Ninja was
282 off fighting juvies with the help of someone called 'greymilk'. Yes the
283 whole gang had gone in their separate ways, which is the way most things
284 end up. It was fun while it lasted...". With that last thought, L'homme
285 rose from his bar stool and exited the Inn. As he walked to his car, he
286 thought about the "McKane" organization, which had been on the tongues of
287 the group the last time they met at the tower. "Oh well... Maybe another
288 day"..."I still have quite a bit of ethanol left over from piper, maybe
289 I'll just drive around this reality for awhile, and see what happens."

328 The Ninja returned to the Inn once more. This time he stuck his stick
329 shift up Greymalkin's other nostril and twisted. He handed him a sheet of paper
330 and disappeared into the shadows. The paper read "That's 636-9200"
331 Outside of the Inn, the Ninja spyed his old friend whom he had asked
332 to return to the Inn. Unfortunately, Fred was jumping through some sort of gate

359 TO THE NINJA:
360 i am completly suprised at how acurate you found out kents identity and 
361 his number (oops this mesage is to the man in gray) but have you ever
362 thought that he could just change his name to say 'the dax man' and
363 all your efforts would ammount to nothing. I am going to California
364 next week so all of you juvie hunters can have a big party...
365 by the way you never did tell me what the good is of showing what a 
366 persons name is and his number is. You can be stereotyped as a 'juvie'
367 if you are under eighteen but you can also be considered a 'juvie' by 
368 calling 'krank calls' to someone like us...
369                                              aufwiedersehen
370                                              tom tom & the mad mod
371 p.s. to the person who stated that I stole his boarder, I must appoligize
372 to you. I have changed it so sorry.

392 thought that you guys might like to know that I have returned.  Things are 
393 getting boring around here.  Let's start a new adventure going.  Anyone got a 
394 'Baddie' that we could go against??
395

401 IT'S 8:10, AND MIG DIDN'T CALL ME TO TELL ME THE TIME OF THE
402 GAME AS HE HAD PLANNED TO.  WHAT'S HAPPENING?????

406 All Riskers.I was unable to get ahold`of Alex at home. Due to the uncertainty of where he lived and`of how I was |o get 
407 v~| hum,got some noise there.
408 due to not knowing how I was getting to Alex's house,I had to decline the game.
409 To give you people an idea of this,I live in Hell,troutdale oregon,at a 666 prefix.
410 Alex is at a 626 prefix. Get the idea yet? about 2.5 hours travel time using tri-mutt.
411 How about some other night,next saturday is out due to Westercon.
412 Luke Binklywalker:whatever you like,I don't care what ppeople call themselfs,
413 but thanks for the info just the same.
414 Ninja:I went back to Le Nerd and found that the number there is listed as 626. Kindly remove stickshift.
415 Tom/Tom&&Mad Mod:when the NETWORK publishes a phone number,
416 this is an indecation to the twit that we know who he is. As for "krank" calls,we (NETWORK) do not make them.
417 It is much easier to find out where said twit goes to  school or works and then,if he keeps things up,
418 well,some things are not fit for public consumption. As for a name change,unless the twit raicaly changes his 
419 tertiarily intrinsic habits,we can find out who he is by a simple database check.

424 Just listening in, I see that no one has used Milchar.  Hmm...  Oh well.  I'll figure out something.
425 +++++++++
426 Doctor: What?  Jericho gone?  I thought you left because of the anti-technology law passed (how are you going to 
427 explain the TARDIS, eh?).  Welcome back, anyway.  Are you going to come with me to work Monday?  It'll be a 7:30 to
428 4:00 affair, so I don't expect you to be there all the time.
429 +++++++++
430 Sigh....  Only one reply about the One and Only East?  Quizmaster, have you no ambition?  Maybe this one will interest
431 you more:
432      We are little airy creatures,
433      All of different voice and features;
434      One of us in glass is set,
435      One of us you'll find in jet,
436      T'other you may see in tin,
437      And the fourth a box within.
438      If the fifth you should pursue,
439      It can never hide from you.
440 Now, can you guess what the "five little airy creatures" are?
441 ++++++++++
442 Mig & Ninja: Well done!  Both of you are cause to make twit-hunters everywhere real proud.

444 IT WAS DARK IN THE INN, CLOSER TO MORNING
445 THEN NIGHT. THE INNKEEPER WAS ASLEEP
446 IN THE BACK ROOM.  A LOW BUZZING NOISE
447 STARTED.  AT FIRST IT WAS VERY LOW BUT WAS NOW BUILDING
448 IN VOLUME. THE INNKEPER WAS AWAKEND, BY BOTH THE SOUND AND THE BLUE
449 GLOW COMMING FROM THE OTHER ROOM.
450 HE SLOWLY WENT TO INVESTAGATE. 
451 WHEN HE OPENDED THE DOOR HE SAW A 
452 PILLER OF BLUE LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
453 OF THE ROOM. AROUND THE PILLER WAS
454 A DARK AREA, JUST INSIDE THAT WAS
455 WHAT APPEARED TO BE SMALL SPARKS.
456 THAT WAS THE BUZZING SOUND.
457 AS HE WATCHED THE PILLER THAT NOW LOOKED LIKE BLUE FLAME A FIGURE WAS
458 FORMING IN THE CENTER OF THE LIGHT.
459 SLOWLY THE FIGURE STARTED TO TAKE FORME
460 IT APPERED TO BE HALF MAN HALF MACHINE
461 IT WAS ABOUT 6'6" TALL AND ALMOST
462 ALL BLACK, THE EYES WERE A STROBING
463 BAR OF GREEN LIGHT WHEN IT STARTED
464 TO TALK THE AREA WHERE THE MOUTH 
465 SHOULD HAVE BEEN FLASHED RED.  THE
466 CHEST HAD A BOX ATTACHED TO IT WITH
467 CABLES GOING FROM THE CHEST TO THE TOP AND 
468 BOTTOM OF THE BOX. ON EATHER SIDE
469 OF THE BOX WERE SWITCHES AND CONTROLES
470     THE INNKEPER QUIETLY SAID WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE DID YOU COME FROM
471  AND WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE
472     I( THEN THERE WAS A SHORT PAUSE) AM 
473 D4QP FROM REMOSA IN THE GALAXY ANDROMEDA.
474 I HAVE COME FOR THE GARNESSA!
475  THE INNKEEPER REPLYED WHAT THE HECK IS
476 A GARNESSA? THE DROID SAID: WELL I THINK
477 YOU CALL IT A RUBY.
478 AHHH THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE AFTER!  THEN 
479 D4QP ASKED 
480 PLEASE LET ME EXPLAIN! THE RUBY WAS
481 TAKEN FROM OUR GALAXY 1500 YEARS AGO
482 AND THAT STARTED A GRATE WAR BETWEEN 
483 THE BERENICES AND MY PEOPLE.  AND 
484 WITH THE CRYSTLEL MAY MASTER WHO IS NAMED DARWIN BRADSHAW
485 WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO END THE WAR
486 ONCE AND FOR ALL.  DARWIN IS A GRATE
487 KELVEN WORROR BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW IT YET. SO IF YOU DON'T HELP ME AND 
488 THE BERENICES TAKE OVER OUR GALAXY YOURS
489 WILL BE NEXT.
490     ***** WILL THE INNKEEPER HELP D4.
491 AND IF HE DOES NOT WILL OUR GALAXY BE TAKEN OVER BY THE BERENICES RACE?
492  TUNE IN LATER WHEN WE HEAR THE INNKEEPER SAY NO #### ARE YOU FOR REAL.

498 "My GOD! What was that?", demanded professor twitson of his assistant, Ed.
499 "I don't know sir, but that last one had the largest reading since the
500 earlier readings from Phantom Writter and Hawthorne." "As much as Hawthorne,
501 that's incredible!", replied twitson. "Ever since the Network installed these
502 spelling sensors, we have been getting high readings almost everytime someone
503 uses the "Backwater" system. "Yes I know", said Ed. "Especially when what
504 the Backwater people call "Twits" get on. But this latest "D4QP". I have
505 rarely seen such high ratings. And to top that off, many of the words that
506 were spelled wrong were less than 6 characters in length." "That makes the
507 readings go right off the scale!". "Who ever this D4QP person is, he or she
508 would make a good specimen for the intensive teaching program they are
509 developing down at the mental hospital" "That's a great idea! Let's see if
510 we can trace D4QP's next contact and try to convince this person to go along
511 with the experiment." "OK...that's a plan. Anyone who can make as many
512 stupid mistakes as D4QP will be a sure success down at the hospital" "What
513 about that Hawthorne character?" "Let's leave him alone for now, he doesn't
514 seem to be hurting anyone at the moment, and his outbursts are few and far
515 between" "Great. Let's check in on the sensors in another 12 hours. Maybe
516 we will have that trace by then."

520 Risknetters: I too have read the 8:00 pm message a little late, like 1:00 am.
521 Can we try for another weekend sometime soon?
522 voyeur: the terminal program works as advertized. I have a question about the
523 two rather similar BASIC programs on the disk. And yes...tic tac rip off was
524 just that...a rip off.

530 THE DOCTOR, FAST FRED AND LYSIAS ALL SEEM TO HAVE STORY LINES GOING AS DOES
531 GREYMALKIN AND NINJA.  
532 TIMELORD PERSON:  HAS YOUR TARDIS RETURNED TO THE INN?
533 IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO GO AFTER; THERE STILL SEEMS TO BE THIS MCKANE OUTFIT
534 AT LARGE.  THEMNAX IS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR THEM TOO AND L'OMME SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A LEAD, OR WAS THAT BARD?
535 LOAM: I REALIZE YOU MUST BE UNDER A STRAIN TRYING TO GET A COMMODE TO DO ANYTHING USEFUL BUT THAT SPELLALERT...  
536 HOW DO YOU SPELL A LERT?? ANYWAY?  INSPITE OF D4QP'S EXCESSIVE INDULGANCE IN CONTROL CHARICTERS IN TIMES RECIENT, HE 
537 DOES SEEM TO BE WRITING SOMETHING INTERESTING.  IT EVEN MESHES WITH LYSIAS AND SCARLET, ET.C.  OFF COURSE I DON'T KNOW
538 HOW OUR EXTEAMED INNKEEPER MUST FEEL ABOUT BEING DRAGED OUT OF BED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!
539 THEMNAX AND SLARTIBARTFARST ARE SEATED AT TABLE WITH, I ASUME, YOU, AMONG OTHERS.  DREAMTOUCHER HASN'T WONDERED OFF ALL 
540 THAT FAR, HE'S IN THE TUB/POOL.  I WOULDN'T BE TOO SURPRISED IF SNOWRUNNER MET SOMEBODY BY THAT FAVORITE FOOTBRIDGE OF 
541 THE INNKEEPER'S AND PAM'S, SHE'S ALREADY SCENT MARKED THE ROAN TREE.  I'M AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT TO DO NEXT MYSELF.

544 ALEX: I believe the expression goes something like "What we have here,
545 ya see, is Fail'r to communicate" (it's hard to write colloquially).
546 Saturday the phones were busy between MiG, L'homme, and myself, trying to determine
547 the status of the game.  Despite the nice day, too many people were inside,
548 calling up this board, so I was unable to get on until now (2 am Sunday).
549 I'm still interested, so I guess we will have to try to work up an agreeable date for
550 all again.
551 L'homme: Really? My modifications to the program actually work as advertised?
552 I must be slipping! (why don't they ever do that for ME?).  The two BASIC programs?
553 As you can see, one is derived from the other.  I can't imagine what questions 
554 they might provoke. (or is it that your head is so full of crappadore basic
555 that you can't remember how a REAL Basic program works.
556 The Group: I guess I am more-or-less taking a vacation from active participation
557 here on BW, and reverting to a state more in keeping with my moniker.
558 Unless, of course, something Interesting arises again.  It's too bad that
559 PAM's rare visits are soliloquies instead of participation in an 'adventure'.
560 That would be (to put it in terms all too many of the Innhabitants understand)-
561 AWESOME!
562 (oh my god, what have I said! Now I'll have MiG and ninja after ME!  I plead temporary
563 insanity due to an overdose of heat)
564 Enough babbling from me for the moment.  Take it away, Aaron...

567 INN FOR SEVERAL HOURS, AND AS NO ONE THAT HE RECOGNIZED HAD COME INN, HE HAD THE TIME TO REFLECT ON HOW HE CAME TO BE 
568 WHERE HE WAS. HIS MOST IMPORTANT INCARNATON WAS, OF COURSE, IN GREECE, IN 459 BC.THIS LIFE WAS A SECOND CHANCE GIVEN HIM
569 BY THE CENRTAL SCRUTINIZER AFTER A LIFE SEVERAL MILLION YEARS BEFORE, IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN A COSMIC PHONE PHREAKER ON A 
570 LITTLE PLANET CIRCLING  A STAR IN THE PLEIADES CONSTELLATION. BECAUSE OF THIS, HE WAS SENT TO HADES. WHILE THERE, THE 
571 LORD OF THE UNDERWORLD, PLUTO, HAD LEARNED THAT LYSIAS KNEW THE KEY TO THE TIME WARP, AND COULD USE IT AT WILL. SOON, 
572 PERSEPHONE, WHO, IN SPITE OF WHAT THE HISORY BOOKS SAY, WAS PLUTOS GIRLFRIEND, LEARNED OF THIS, AND USING HER INFLUENCE
573 (!) WITH PLUTO, WAS ABLE TO COERCE LYSIAS TO TRAVEL THROUGH TIME, SEARCHING FOR A RUBY, THAT HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM HER, 
574 AND WHICH CONTAINED THE SECRET OF THE TOTAL POWER, (FOR GOOD OR EVIL), OF THE UNIVERSE.SINCE THE RUBY HAD BEEN STOLEN BY
575 A WIZARD, ON PLANET EARTH, (SHE BELIEVED) WHO FREQUENTED A PLACE CALLED " THE INN ".THE WIZARD HAD HAD MANY INCARNATIONS
576 AND IN EACH, HAD SOMEHOW MANAGED TO ALWAYS FIND, AND KEEP, THE RUBY. WHEN HE WAS IN THE LIFE OF A PERSON NAMED "ROTHMAN"
577 HE LOCATED IT, ETC, ETC. LYSIAS HAS SPENT THOUSANDS OF YEARS TRYING TO TRACK IT DOWN, BUT EVERY TIME HE GETS CLOSE, THE 
578 WIZARD MANAGES TO DISAPPEAR. WITH THE RUBY. BUT, THIS TIME, IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN LOST, AND LYSIAS IS REALLY CONCERNED
579 BUT-AS HE HAS THE KEY TO THE TIME WARP, HE KNOWS THAT SOONER OR LATER, HE WILL GET IT
580 IF HE COULD MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE WIZARD AT THE INN, THEY COULD TEAM UP, AND MAYBE EVEN GET CERTAIN CONCESSIONS FROM 
581 PERSEPHONE. LYSIAS REMEMBERED ALL THIS AS HE SAT A THE INN, AND, ORDERING ANOTHER ALE, WAITED-----
