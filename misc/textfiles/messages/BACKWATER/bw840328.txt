22 A new disk, that makes it twice in a couple of weeks for me.
23 I apologize for the rather messed up intro. but I fell that what
24 the previous user had done to it was inexcusable and slightly
25 --------------.  Hmmmm, thats the first time I've actually felt
26 like calling names on this system and I consider myself fairly 
27 tolerant.

33    Dorothy, Ozma, Tick-Tock, this is getting a bit confusing
34 if not a bit nostalgic. I suppose the Sawhorse, Proffessor Wogglebug,
35 and everything else are around also. This is getting a bit unusual,
36 wizards zapping in and out, and the newly arrived salazar babbleling
37 about orcs, of all things, orcs in the sewers of the Emerald City!
38 Let's see here, a quick cover spell to make sure no one takes notice
39 of me, |he apprentice might notice but nobody else will. If I take
40 my handy-dandy reality phase controller and place me half out of sync.
41 I should be able to scout out the vest of the city easily and rejoin 
42 the party as they leave. I slip a small silver object into the bard's
43 pocket and leave through the nearest wall wondering what I will find
44 in the rest of the wizard's apartments.

113 MIG: I see I'm not the only one to put 2 and 2 together.  I figured
114 I was giving too many clues away, but thought I would probably expose
115 myself (figuratively!) at the meeting.  Time to create a new identity, I guess.
116 Actually, I do (did) know what C-41 was, but as I do not dabble in
117 photography, I didn't have the details at hand.  I was able to
118 ascertain the 7-step 24.5 minute timing, but could only narrow the
119 temp to 90-100. (my father develops B&W, not color).
120 Oh yeah:  Break on through to the other side.

192      The woods were dark and forboding as I made my way through them in  my 
193 search.   I had been stumbling through the underbrush for sometime now, and 
194 still there was no trace of what I had been looking for.   Brushing aside a 
195 branch, I peer ahead.  What's that?  Is it?  No... just a decaying stump, a 
196 shadow of its own once greatness.   Pressing on, I wander further untill it 
197 begins  to turn dark and the trees start to reach out for me for their  own 
198 evil  purposes.   Then as the last light is fading I trip over an  extended 
199 root and land in a clearing.   Well, this looks like as good a place as any 
200 to spend the rest of the night.  
201      Sitting my backpack down,  I begin to open it up.  I had to open it up 
202 to  about  the  size of a small auto to dig out a sleeping bag  and  enough 
203 equipment to make a fire and something to eat.  It nearly filled the little 
204 clearing,  and I had great difficulty getting the food out of the  storrage 
205 compartment.  But,  finally I had everything I needed and closed it back up 
206 to backpack size again.
207      Setting  up camp,  I started a fire going to get a bit of warmth going 
208 in this cold and damp place.  While I sat there eating I considered what my 
209 next  course of action would be.   Perhaps I should give up trying to  find 
210 any  trace  in the woods.  For weeks now I have  looked,  and  still  found 
211 nothing.   That  cloaked man at the Inn who called himself Tarn had said  I 
212 would find a clue here,  but I haven't seen anything yet.   Perhapps he was 
213 mistaken, for his mind was fogged with too many drinks, and he seemed to be 
214 greatly depressed.  
215      Finishing my supper, I decided to not open the backpack tonight to put 
216 away  the  dinner  equipment,  and instead I would wait until after  I  had 
217 breakfast in the morning.  
218      Settling back to relax, I was gazing at the fire when I happen to look 
219 to one side and noticed that the ground had been disturbed sometime in  the 
220 recent  past.   Getting  up,  I  took a look at it.   Though  it  had  been 
221 disturbed  at  one side,  it was a pentagram that someone had  drawn.  This 
222 could very well be what I am looking for!   Tracing it around, I found that 
223 it  went completly around the clearing except for the north side which  had 
224 been partially erased.   Taking a stick,  I retraced the distrubed line  so 
225 that  I  could  better see that pattern.   Yes,  it was  most  definatly  a 
226 pentagram!   I  will definatly have to check this out in the morning when I 
227 can get a better look at it.  
228      With  that thought I returned to the fire and rolled out  my  sleeping 
229 bag,  and settled in for the evening feeling far more relaxed and confident 
230 now that I had finally found a clue.  Tomorrow I will have more information 
231 to  continue my search.   Strange,  things seem much quieter then they were 
232 earlier.   All I can hear is the crackling of the fire,  none of the normal 
233 sounds  that you would normally hear in the forest at night.   And I  could 
234 have sworn that I heard the chuckling of a streem off in the distance,  yet 
235 I know that there is none within several miles.  Most strange.  I will have 
236 take  a look in the morning.   Turning my back to the fire,  I snuggle down 
237 into the sleeping bag and go to sleep.  
238      My  dreams  were troubled all night  with  demons,  wizards,  dragons, 
239 elves,  and other strange and bizare creatures.   Once I woke up in a  cold 
240 sweat  and  it  seemed like the entire clearing was bathed in  pale  bluish 
241 green shimmering light.   I passed it off as just a trick of my bleary eyes 
242 and the dying fire.   Settling back once more, I went back to sleep knowing 
243 that I would soon be able to make more effective headway in the morning  in 
244 my search for the elusive PAM.

458 AND TRACK 40 AS FIRST TRACK ON SIDE B. THE FIRST 3 TRACKS ARE THE CPM
459 SYSTEM TRACKS. IT ALLOWS 64 DIRECTORY ENTERIES. TOTAL SIZE = 171K OF
460 AVAILABLE STRORRAGE.
461 THE REASON FOR THE WEIRD FORMAT, IS BECAUSE IT WAS CREATED BACK IN '75
462 AND WAS INTENDED TO BE UPWARD COMPATIBLE (DOWNWARD?) FROM 8" DISKS.
463 IT STARTED ON SHUGART SA400'S WITH ONLY 35 TRACKS AND THEN WENT TO 
464 40 TRACKS WHEN THEY BECAME AVALABLE. THEN WHEN DOUBLE SIDED CAME OUT
465 WE JUST ADDED MORE TRACKS ONTO THE BACK SO THAT THE NEW MACHINES 
466 COULD STILL READ THE OLD MACHINES DISKS WITHOUT HAVING TO USE A DIFFERENT
467 DISK READ ROUTINE. CONSIDERING THAT THE OPERATING SYSTEM WAS IN EPROM,
468 AND THERE WAS ONLY 8K AVALABLE (ONLY 2K OF WHICH WAS ALOCATED TO THE 
469 DISK ROUTINES) YOU CAN SEE THE PROBLEM. YOU'VE SEEN BWMS, SO YOU KNOW
470 WHAT THE MACHINE LOOKED LIKE, SINCE BWMS IS THE MACHINE THAT I AM 
471 TALKING ABOUT.
472 ANYBODY WANT TO BUY A SHUGART MINISTREAKER CONTROLER? ANYBODY KNOW 
473 WHAT A SHUGART MINISTREAKER CONTROLER IS?

477 FOR SOMEONE TO DO SOME PROGRAMING ON A MICRODATA COMPUTER. IF YOUR
478 INTERESTED YOU MIGHT GIVEN THEM A CALL. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE
479 LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO DO SOME PROGRAMING IN Z80 (8080) CODE ON A
480 PIECE OF COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT BUILT BY EDGE TECH. I DON'T KNOW FOR
481 SURE WHAT IT IS HE WANTS DONE ON IT, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE A SLIGHT MODIFICATION
482 TO SOME EXISTING CODE. HE SAYS HE HAS THE SOURCE AND ALL THAT. SO AGAIN,

524      Before I began my career at Tandy Corp, and more recently as CEO of
525 Reality Corp (don't ask), I was a big BOC groupie. My hair still stands on the
526 back of my neck when I get my old albums out and listen to such songs
527 as 'Black Blade', 'Debbie Denise', et al...Ah yes...the searing vocals
528 of Eric Bloom, and the wonderful relation between guitar and drum the band
529 enjoys. Thank you for bringing a little happiness to my office, in a time where
530 meetings with disgruntled employees and excitable creditors have my stomach
531 in notes most of the time...
