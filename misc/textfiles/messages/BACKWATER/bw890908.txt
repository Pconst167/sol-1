108 >But what both Friar and I have been saying is that *statements* may be true,
109 > false, or anything inbetween. Your example above will do quite well:
110 > "water boils". The statement may be true or it may be false. But it requires 
111 > information not present in the statement OR IN THE RULES OF DISCOURSE to 
112 > determine which.
113  
114         Of course.  A collection of glyphs can have no logical value unless
115         they are assigned a meaning, but that meaning is (in my view) within
116         the realm of fact and therefore subject to strict truth or falsehood.
117         Sure I have to know what "water" is and what "boil" means before I can
118         logically evaluate the sentence, and I'll have to have some sort of
119         evidence in order to come to a conclusion, but in the end water either
120         boils (under *some* set of conditions) or it does not.  All I'm saying
121         is that the *meaning* of a statement must be true or false.  I hope
122         you didn't think me so foolish as to think that English statements 
123         somehow had value separate from their meanings.
124         I'm not saying you can't make a statement that you're unsure about
125         (and could therefore call "probably true") or that you can't make a 
126         more accurate statement (closer to the Truth) and call it "truer" 
127         than another statement, but in the absolute sense a statement's 
128         meaning is always either true or false.
129  
130 > That Is why I said it is almost impossible to make a true 
131 > statement about reality.
132 > The statement must be able to stand on it's own. 
133  
134         If you mean that the statement must stand alone without its meaning,
135         I agree completely with your conclusion.  It is already divorced 
136         from reality, therefore it can have no correlation with it.  It is,
137         however, very easy to make a statement whose meaning is true - just
138         make a statement and it's complement - one and only one meaning can
139         be true.  If you wish to make the distinction, I'll concede that a
140         sentence, stripped of its meaning, cannot be logically evaluated, 
141         but once a meaning has been assigned (through the rules of the
142         language, etc.), that meaning must have a truth value or be
143         paradoxical.
144  
145 >Likewise, "This sentence is false" can't be a paradox, because the only means
146 >of parsing it that will even give it the appearance of one is English. English
147 >st a "formal system". Thus it can't have paradoxes...
148  
149         Sure, "This sentence is false." makes a great English sentence.  It
150         has a subject, a verb, etc..   One can apply the laws of English to
151         it and come up with a meaning.  However, if one applies logic to
152         that meaning, one will discover that it is nonsensical.  I fused 
153         the two steps in earlier discussions because we were discussing 
154         facts, not language (perhaps I should not have).
155                 Hmmm, differentiating the steps does bring into account
156         another level of abstraction, and this *could* make the sentence
157         non-self-referential since the *sentence* would fall under the
158         category of English, while the *meaning* of the sentence would
159         be in the realm of logic.  False wouldn't be a terribly applicable
160         adjective to an English sentence, but I see where you might 
161         conclude that the sentence is not about its meaning.  This would
162         be a nice convention for self-referentials (doesn't really apply
163         anything else) if it is consistent with the rest of the language.
164         Is this what you meant?  This makes sense to me.

216 As we have it now, Friar is on the road, following the girl, with the two
217 strangers from the Inn far behind him.
218 Then the Cloaked Man appears, states that Friar is responsible for "crimes
219 against his world" and points a thin strip of steel that appears to be a 
220 bent coat hanger at his intended target, citing his responsibility as "the
221 Judge, the One who Decides, and the One Who Carries Out."  
222 Brief Description Run-Down:  The Cloaked Man is, of course, cloaked in a blue,
223 sparkling shroud, with gold fasteners.  His voice carries a metallic tint, and
224 his eyes appear misted over. What would appear to be electrical energy courses
225 around him.  He appeared to Friar in two different forms.  First, that of a 
226 green cloud (which conceals at first,   since the sky of Pyrrix Aaaal is green)
227 and then in the humanoid form that now  confronts him.  He is dressed fairly
228 well, albiet out of place on P.A.

284                 9/08/89 By PATRICK McDOWELL Associated Press Writer
285    PARIS (AP) -- A year after radiocarbon tests found the Shroud of Turin to be
286 only 700 years old, a participant in a shroud symposium said Friday the bright
287 light of the Resurrection may have altered the aging process.
288    "Many of the questions boil down to this," said Jacques Evin, an engineer at
289 the Radiocarbon Laboratory of Lyon. "In the event of the Resurrection of Christ
290 would there have been a sufficient burst of light to alter the process of carbo
291 decay?"
292    The Paris International Scientific Symposium on the Shroud of Turin gave
293 "shroudies" -- dedicated students of what is purported to be the burial cloth o
294 Jesus Christ -- their first chance to contest the findings issued in October
295 1988.
296    "It is a most unusual object and it's an object that means a lot of things t
297 a lot of people," said Professor Michael Tite of the British Museum research
298 laboratory at the end of the two-day gathering. "Anything you do with it is
299 bound to cause controversy."
300    Tite was at the heart of the debate last year. He headed one of three
301 laboratories that said the shroud was made about 700 years ago, 13 centuries
302 after the death of Christ. Scientific teams from the University of Arizona and
303 University of Zurich also participated.
304    Rather than resolving questions of the shroud's authenticity, the radiocarbo
305 tests appear to have become a new source of argument.
306    The 14-yard-long cloth bears a faint, yellowish negative image of the front
307 and back of a man with thorn marks on the head, lacerations from flogging on th
308 back and bruises on the shoulders, suggestive of accounts of Christ's
309 crucifixion.
310    It has been kept in Italy's Cathedral of Turin since the Middle Ages, when
311 creation of false religious relics was widespread. The now-retired Roman
312 Catholic cardinal there, Anastasio Ballestrero, invited scientists last year to
313 test samples the size of postage stamps with radiocarbon dating techniques.
314    Datings by the laboratories ranged from 1260 to 1390. Ballestrero eventually
315 endorsed the results, but said the shroud's significance as an object of deep
316 religious faith was unchanged.
317    Few symposium participants contested the test results, but Evin and others
318 questioned whether the cloth had been altered somehow to produce an inaccurate
319 reading.
320    Tite was skeptical of Evin's theory.
321    "It seems to me a slight coincidence that, if there was a burst of radiation
322 it would have been just enough to date the cloth to the 14th century," he said.
323    Some of the 100 spectators cheered when one of their number insisted the
324 scientists had tested a piece of the cloth near a seam that was restored in the
325 16th or 17th century.
326    "We do not have a pure specimen," he declared. "It was contaminated. There
327 were threads from the 16th century extending into the main part of the shroud. 
328 think we may be dealing with a clever forger who rewove the threads."
329    Tite said the results would have been affected only if 60-70 percent of the
330 cloth were rewoven.
331    John Jackson, 43, of Colorado Springs, Colo., said density measurements of
332 the frontal image on the cloth appear to show a body was lifted through it, but
333 he stopped well short of calling the phenomenon evidence of the Resurrection.
334    "I don't want to get into too much speculation on the religious
335 implications," said Jackson, who has studied the shroud for 15 years. "If the
336 shroud is medieval, then this image was formed then.
337    "I'm also open to the fact that if someone else can explain this image in a
338 conventional way, then that should take priority over mine."
339

341    CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled Jim Bakker competent to stand
342 trial on fraud charges Wednesday after a government psychiatrist testified the
343 PTL founder was not going crazy when he broke down last week.
344    Bakker's trial resumed nearly a week after he was found hiding under a couch
345 and hallucinating in his lawyer's office last Thursday. He was sent to a federa
346 prison in Butner for psychiatric evaluation.
347    "For the first time in three years, the whole situation came home to him and
348 he began to cry," Sally Johnson, chief of psychiatric services at the prison,
349 told U.S. District Judge Robert Potter.
350    "He is not going crazy," Ms. Johnson testified with jurors absent. "He has n
351 hidden mental illness. The stress that he's feeling is normal. I can't rule it
352 out that it won't happen again, but I can't rule it in either."
353    Potter ordered Bakker released from federal marshals' custody and asked
354 Bakker, who was brought to court in leg irons and handcuffs, to stand and answe
355 qestions.
356    "Do you understand what you are on trial here for?" the judge asked Bakker,
357 who is accused of fleecing followers of his PTL ministry.
358    "Yes sir," Bakker responded quietly.
359    Asked if he was able to assist his lawyers, Bakker said, "I'm very tired, bu
360 I believe I can."
361    Bakker, 49, showed little emotion, sometimes hanging his head and staring at
362 the floor. He wore a suit his wife, Tammy Faye, had brought him.
363    Mrs. Bakker, who attended the hearing with other family members, has
364 protested her husband's treatment at the federal prison hospital.
365    "This should not be allowed in the United States of America," was her only
366 comment as she left the courthouse.
367    Potter, after meeting with attorneys in chambers, also denied defense
368 lawyers' motions for a mistrial, for a continuance and for dismissal of the
369 indictment against Bakker.
370    Bakker, who resigned from the PTL ministry in 1987 during a sex-and-money
371 scandal, went on trial Aug. 28 on conspiracy and fraud charges. Prosecutors sai
372 he used nearly $4 million in ministry funds to live in high style.
373    If convicted on all 24 counts against him, he could could receive 120 years
374 in prison and more than $5 million in fines.
375    After Wednesday's lunch break, former PTL Vice President Steve Nelson, who
376 collapsed under defense cross-examination last Wednesday, resumed testifying fo
377 the prosecution.
378    Questioned by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller, Nelson said he went to
379 Bakker and Richard Dortch, another ex-PTL vice president, to express his concer
380 over the number of "lifetime partnerships" sold at Heritage USA, the Christian
381 retreat and amusement park created by Bakker.
382    Prosecutors contend that Bakker oversold partnerships despite his statements
383 on TV and in promotional literature that there was a limit. A $1,000 donation
384 gave a partner free lodging in the 500-room hotel three nights a year.
385    "I told them we had problems getting people in there," Nelson said. "I told
386 them we could not sell more. ..." He said Bakker and Dortch told him to keep
387 selling the partnerships.
388    Dortch, indicted with Bakker, pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and
389 conspiracy and was sentenced to eight years in prison and a $200,000 fine.
390    Defense attorney Harold Bender, who was questioning Nelson last week when th
391 witness fainted, chose not to cross-examine him Wednesday. In the mistrial
392 motion, Bender said the collapse had prejudiced the jury against Bakker.
393    Bakker appeared more alert during Nelson's testimony. He smiled, chatted wit
394 attorneys and reviewed documents. Mrs. Bakker did not attend the afternoon
395 session.
396    Court was recessed for the day around 5:30 p.m. As Bakker left the
397 courthouse, he waved at photographers and said, "I'm glad to be out of where I
398 was." He also said he had the flu, then got into Bender's BMW sedan and left.
399    During the morning session, Ms. Johnson said her preliminary diagnosis of
400 Bakker was that he had suffered a panic attack after Nelson's collapse. Nelson
401 had testified that he had told Bakker someone could go to prison because of the
402 ministry's financial practices.
403    Bakker didn't come to court the next day, and lawyers told Potter he was
404 hallucinating and hiding his head under a couch at their office.
405    Asked if she thought Bakker had faked his emotional collapse, the doctor sai
406 n.
407    "It was a powerful emotional reaction and release," Ms. Johnson said. "The
408 weight of all these things began to coalesce. ...
409    Ms. Johnson also said Bakker suffered narcissism, or excessive
410 self-absorption, and depression.
411    The psychiatrist said the panic attack was not caused by Bakker's taking an
412 anti-depressant prescribed by his private psychiatrist, but could not rule out
413 that it had had an impact on his mental state. She also testified that Bakker
414 had taken aspirin and is taking an antibiotic for a cold.
415    Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Ms. Johnson if she felt Bakker wa
416 hallucinating when he left court last week.
417    "I did not label it as hallucinatory phenomena," she replied.
418    She said Bakker told her he hadn't felt well and that radio and television
419 news crews gathered at the courthouse took on the form of frightening animals.
420 She said he told her they appeared as "large ants with antennae."
421    Ms. Johnson said Bakker insisted he hadn't lost touch with reality.
422    "He did not lose sight that they were actually the press," she said. "It was
423 an experience in which he was very frightened and there was a large number of
424 people in the crowd."
425                                                                               
426 So...who's to say what's "real news" and what's "more of the story"...or right 
427 or left for that matter.  Lee Atwater was unavailable for comment on either.  
428

476 Well, I thought I'd do somthing about the dirth of stories here on backwater.
477 What follows is a first draft of a short story that just sort of wrote 
478 itself. Comments will be greatly appreciated.
479     You can't always be sure of the things you say. Somtimes even the
480 The most well respected fact will turn out to be wrong. Take for instance
481 last Saturday. I was sitting on a barstool down at Ernies. Don't get the
482 idea that I go there often, because I don't. I just happened to be there.
483 It was the ussual crowd, Only the lonely frequent these halls. Not that that
484 is altogether bad. Lonely people can have some of the most interesting stories
485 to tell.
486  
487     So I sat there, waiting for somthing to happen. Not expecting it, just
488 waiting. I waited till near closing. Then when I'd almost given up hope
489 it happened.
490  
491     Ahm, She walked in... No, nothing as cliche' as that. It was actually
492 a largish grey rat. It came running from behind the bar, and almost
493 imediatly I could hear Ernie cursing and calling after it. "Jennings
494 you swine, get back here and into your cage."
495  
496     Jennings? Who names a rat Jennings and sticks it in a
497 cage behind a bar? I hadn't thought Ernie anywhere near that imaginative.
498  
499     The rat wasn't buying it. He just kept running. Looked like the front
500 door was his destination. I layed my money down on the table and got out
501 just behind him, with Ernie on my heels. It was dark, and most of the cars had
502 left the parking lot. I only lived a block or so away, so a car was the least
503 of my wories. Ernie had ran passed me and was yelling at the top of his
504 lungs in alternite directions. "Jennings! You scoundrel! Get back here!"
505 He kept it up for the better part of an hour. The cops came out twice, and
506 the second time they carted him off. The patrons had been taking care of
507 the bar during the owners little 'illness'.
508  
509     I walked behind the counter and checked the till. It looked like
510 somebody had been sober enough to recognize the possibilities there. That
511 meant there was no percentage in it for me, atleast from that angle. So
512 I grabbed a couple of crackers from the bar and went outside. Being in front
513 of Ernie I had seen a bit more. So I walked over to the Dumpster and dropped
514 a cracker. "Ok Jennings you can come out now, he's gone."
515  
516     "Not bloody likely. I don't even know you."
517  
518     "So, do you want to sit under that trashcan for the rest of your days
519 or do you want come out and talk business." Silence, or the closest thing
520 you can get to it in the big city. "Look, We can do this easy, or we can
521 do it hard. So make it easy on both of us and come out."
522  
523     "Say I did, whats in it for me?"
524  
525     I smiled, my hunch had been correct. "Depends on the circumstances."
526  
527     "Such as?"
528  
529     "How did you happen to become a rat in a cage in the back of the
530 bar at Ernies."
531  
532     "Oh, that. Well, you know how it is. I had a bad day."
533  
534     "Do tell."
535  
536     "You really want to hear this?"
537  
538     "Yes."
539  
540     "Well, I used to be a cockerspanial. Then one day I woke up as a rat.
541 That was a bit of a shock. Especialy since I'd been curled up next to
542 Solips, the family cat. Luckily I managed to get out of there before he
543 noticed me. Out the cat door and into the street. I've been running ever
544 since."
545  
546     "And before that?"
547  
548     "I was one of those big sea turtles. A fun life, and not to bad if you
549 know how to avoid the pitfalls. had to be carefull though, speed wasn't
550 my strong point back then."
551  
552     It was all starting to make sense to me. All that was left was arranging
553 payment. "I'll bet you started life out as a human?"
554  
555     "Yep, near as I can figure it I started life out as a tinker in medieval
556 England."
557  
558     "And did a brass ring come into your possesion a short time before
559 these problems started?"
560  
561     "Let me thing... Could have been, it's been a century or two you know."
562  
563     "Well then, I think I can solve your problem. All I want is the ring."
564  
565     "Your welcome to it, if I have it and if you can get to it."
566  
567     "Good, are you going to come out from under there now?"
568  
569     "Oh sure."
570  
571     Out he waddled, one of the biggest rats I had ever seen. He looked up
572 at me in anticipation. "Well?"
573  
574     "One last question, why were you in that cage?"
575  
576     "Ernie caught me mumbling to myself in his storage room. had me netted
577 before I knew what was happening."
578  
579     I could believe Ernie had had the oppurtunity to develope such skills.
580 I pulled the wand from the inner pocket of my coat. Mumbled the words to
581 the unbinding and stood back. The spot that had held the rat a moment
582 before now held a short brown haired man dressed in the clothes of
583 a medieval merchant. And on the ring finger of his left had was a brass
584 ring. "Hurry, and give me the ring."
585  
586     "No problem, happy to be rid of it." He replied. He took it from his
587 finger and handed it to me. This was going to be well worth my trouble,
588 I'd recovered one of my earlier devices and saved myself a finders fee.
589  
590     "Now all I have to do is figure out how to make a living."
591  
592     "You shouldn't have any problems with that. Theres always work available
593 for a craftsman, even today." I placed the wand back in its hiding place
594 and stuck the ring in another of my many pockets and bid him farewell.
595 "Yes," I thought. "Still work for craftsman."
596  
597  
598 This is the first thing I've written since last march. Some of you will 
599 understand that date. I'm hoping I'll be able to keep it up.

605 APn  09/12/89 By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL Associated Press Writer
606    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-nuclear activists today protested the launch next
607 month of a nuclear-powered space probe, but administration officials say
608 President Bush will not block the flight.
609    The president is expected by next week to authorize the use of a 48-pound
610 nuclear generator to provide electrical power for the Galileo spacecraft,
611 scheduled for launch to Jupiter from the shuttle Atlantis on Oct. 12.
612    The nuclear powerplant is similar to the one the Voyager 2 spacecraft used s
613 successfully on its 12-year journey to Neptune and beyond, and on 21 other spac
614 devices. But protesters worry about a release of radioactivity should the
615 Atlantis have an accident similar to the one that destroyed Challenger.
616    A recent safety analysis by the National Aeronautics and Space Administratio
617 concluded, "the probability of an accident resulting in a release of plutonium
618 ranges from 1-in-2,500 to 1-in-2 million and any release from these low
619 probability events would be very small."
620    About a half dozen sign-carrying protesters stood outside NASA's national
621 headquarters today, passing out a flyer that said, "Keep Project Galileo's
622 plutonium on the ground."
623    One sign said, "If Galileo explodes, kiss Florida goodbye," and another said
624 "One pound of plutonium could kill every person on Earth." The demonstrators
625 represented the Maryland Safe Energy Coalition, which is headquartered in
626 Columbia, Md.
627    This weekend, a group called the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice,
628 says it will begin a 200-mile "peace walk" from Cape Canaveral to Kings Bay,
629 Ga., to protest both the Galileo probe and the Trident missile program.
630    A spokesman said the walk will be completed Oct. 8 and the protesters will
631 return in time for the Atlantis launch.
632    "We are going to attempt to enter the launch area and sit on the launch pad"
633 to halt the October launch, said Bruce Gagnon of Orlando, leader of the Florida
634 group which has staged past demonstrations against Trident launches.
635    King's Bay is where the Trident is flight tested.
636    A lawyer for the Christic Institute, Larry Sinkin, said the group will file
637 suit in federal court later this month to stop the Atlantis launch, citing amon
638 its reasons "the very poor record NASA has of estimating risks" and "the
639 reliability of the shuttle itself."
640    The president's science advisers are studying risk assessments of the launch
641 and a separate safety evaluation, Thomas P. Rona, deputy director of the White
642 House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said Monday.
643    An administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity, asked if the
644 Galileo launch will be approved, replied "certainly."
645    Rona declined to say what the recommendation to Bush will be but said "every
646 possible design precaution has been taken. ... My personal opinion is that the
647 shuttle is far more reliable now than before."
648    Elizabeth Prestridge, spokeswoman for the National Space Council which is
649 chaired by Vice President Dan Quayle, said the staff considers the Galileo prob
650 safe. And a congressional source said there is no doubt the president will allo
651 the launch.
652    The review process, which makes White House approval mandatory before nuclea
653 iotopes can be launched into space, has been in effect since 1977.
654    The nuclear devices are called RTGs, for radioisotope thermoelectric
655 generators. They have never caused a spacecraft failure, although three of the
656 22 have been involved in space mission accidents with no release of plutonium.
657    Galileo will be the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter and it will insert a
658 probe into the atmosphere to investigate thick cloud layers covering the huge
659 planet. The trip is a complicated one in which the spacecraft will twice return
660 near Earth for gravity boosts to gain necessary velocity to reach Jupiter in
661 1995.
662           Would YOU risk the life of EVERY PERSON on earth with 1 in 2500 odds?

669      pursuing plans to launch the Project Galileo shuttle space probe which
670      will carry enough plutonium to kill every person on earth.
671           Theoretically, one pound of polutonium, uniformly distributed,
672      has the potential to give everyone on the planet a fatal case of lung
673      cancer.  Galileo will have 49.25 pounds of plutonium on board, most of
674      it plutonium 238, a radioisotope 300 times more radioactive than the
675      one used as fuel for atomic bombs.
676           Critics of the plan, such as Dr. John Gofman, professor of
677      medical physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and Michio
678      Kaku, professor of nuclear physics at the City University of New York
679      claim that putting Galileo's plutonium payload into space is both
680      risky and unnecessary.
681           The plutonium will be used to fuel "radioisotope thermoelectric
682      generators" which keep instrumentation warm.  Although NASA and the
683      DOE say there are no alternatives, professor Kaku asserts that the
684      latest advances in solar cells make it possible to generate solar
685      electricity even as far away as Jupiter, Galileo's destination.
686           NASA downplays the possibility of the release of plutonim in an
687      accident, stressing that the substance will be encapsulated in "clads"
688      made from iridium alloy in a graphite shell.  The DOE contends that
689      clads can withstand explosive pressures up to 2,200 pounds per square
690      inch.  However, a DOE safety analysis report on the Galileo mission
691      obtained under FOIA states that from the viewpoint of potential
692      nuclear fuel release, the most critical accidents would occur on the
693      launch pad.  Launch pad accident scenarios, such as "tipovers" and
694      "pushovers" are estimated to generate explosive pressures as high as
695      19,600 psi.
696           Once in space, Galileo is still potentially danglerous.  Since
697      the solid-fuel rocket substituted for the highly volatile liquid-fuel
698      Centaur rocket used in the Challenger does not have the power of the
699      Centaur, NASA devised a plan to use the earth's gravitational pull to
700      increase the rocket's momentum sufficiently to reach Jupiter.  During
701      the "flyby" orbits around the earth, Galileo would at times be only
702      277 miles overhead.  A 1987 NASA report estimates the chance of
703      Galileo inadvertently reentering the earth's atmosphere to be less
704      than one in a million, and, as such, an accident scenario is deemed
705      not credible.
706           NASA set the probability figures for the chance of a shuttle
707      accident at one in 100,000 for thhe Challenger. Investigation 
708      following the crash put the figure at closer to one in 25.
709           While "The Lethal Shuttle: Plutonium Payload Scheduled" was one
710      of the top 10 overlooked stories cited by Project Censored in 1986,
711      the continued failure of the media to draw attention to the potential
712      risk of Project Galileo fully warrants its renomination for 1987.

718 Doesn't really matter much when we're all gasping for air with failing lungs.

743 prefer situational ethics to this?

756    Do you ignore them?
757  
758    Before the flames of the board engluf me and turn me into
759 Texas Style Bar - B - Que, consider that I too have felt all of the
760 above, at least once in my life.  I do not sport a "correct" answer,
761 in fact, I'm not so sure there is an answer, but it seems there is
762 a Solution or Path to follow - that is, a course of action that should
763 be continued but not placed as the Final Result.  Pain is both real and
764 imagined.  This last sentence is True to me - DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TELL
765 ME OTHERWISE - for you are not me, and have not experienced the different
766 effects of this.  After a lecture on the concept of reality, I had a
767 splitting headache that, reguardless of my actions or what I concentrated
768 on, would NOT GO AWAY.  I asked my instructor, "if what you're saying is
769 true, then I should be able to make my headache disappear."  "Well,
770 yes, something like that..." he replied.  So I closed my eyes, and told
771 myself that the headache did not exist 3 times.  By the third time, my
772 headache DISAPPEARED completely, and did not return, no matter how many
773 times I tried to re-evaluate the lecture that started it.  From
774 that day forth, I understood but did not realize the concept of
775 self-fulfilling prophicies and self-programming.  Only now, two
776 years later, have I begun to search for this skill again.  And you
777 think me not to be in contact with reality?  Sometimes I wonder about
778 the world.  I wonder what would happen if the 80% that had not suddenly
779 sealed off the 20% that did have, buy "doing their own thing"; starting
780 a new economy and ethical system, and bartering and understanding and
781 helping each other, instead of SERVING. ometimes I become so sick
782 from the menial job that I have that I have to call in sick for a day
783 to escape the pain - data entry is certainly the "Sweatshop" job of the time - 
784 and I ponder about how I could escape from this, and become
785 non-dependent without hurting others.
786  
787   I must not despair - that is the one thing that we are actually
788 Taught to do.  I promised that my future child WILL NOT SUFFER from
789 the conditioning and enslavement of the public education system - 
790 which I also understand from my years of living with my father, an
791 Art teacher and Union President (ag! yech!) - is their hope?
792 Am I truely alone, in a world of insane and damaged people who
793 would rather hurt others than to help themselves heal?
794  
795    Or is my schizophrenic writing simply a "soft-centered approach"?

858 	Personally, the prospect of every living thing on the planet being
859 wiped out doesn't seem to bother me.  I mean, once it's happened, it
860 won't really bother us much since we'd all be dead, and there won't be
861 much we'll be able to do about it anyways.  Besides, I think the only
862 nuclear explosion capable of wiping out all life is one sheathed in
863 cobalt.  We've had a lot more plutonium massed together before and 
864 exploded it (remember Nagasaki history buffs?) and it didn't affect 
865 the whole planet very much (although it was a bit of an inconvenience
866 for the Japanese it killed).  One pound of plutonium may be able to 
867 kill all life on the planet, but not when it is exploding, and you'd 
868 have to distribute it pretty widely too.
869  
870 Besides, who needs Florida anyhow?  After all, it's only an extension

885 As for the RTG's on Galileo, similar units were used to power the instrument
886 packages that the Apollo missions left on the moon. Remember Apollo 13? It had
887 one aboard. When the astronauts abandoned the LM, the RTG was still aboard.
888 Measurement taken after the mission indicate that the RTG must have survived 
889 reentry intact. So much for the risks when Galileo makes it's swings past
890 here on its way to Jupiter.
891 It's also fairly certain that even in a Challenger type accident the RTG would
892 survive intact. And even if it *did* break open, the stuff wouldn't spread far.
893 Finally, statements like "evenly distibuted one pound of plutonium could kill 
894 everyone on earth" *less* truthful than a statement such as "properly 
895 distibuted, one man's ejaculation could get every woman on earth pregnant".
896 That's the kind of spreading around they are talking about. And the dosage they
897 are calling *lethal* is based on taking an *old* figure for ALLOWABLE YEARLY
898 INDUSTRIAL EXPOSURE and calling that "lethal". 
899 In short, these people are fear-mongering zealots who won't let mere facts 
900 interfere with their holy crusade against anything with the word "nuclear"

934 Use solar power at Jupiter?  Hold it a minute.  Solar power might suffice
935 for *some* equipment at Earth distance, but we're talking about light
936 energy at Jupiter- does the phrase 'inverse-square law' mean anything to
937 you?  I don't remember the distance figures for Jupiter at the moment, but
938 I'm betting heavy money that the light flux at Jupiter would be less than
939 1/4th that at Earth distance.  Perhaps the equipment on Galileo takes a
940 wee bit more energy to power than that on Voyager?  Granted, this is an
941 off-the-cuff estimate of power needs and light availability, but even so
942 I canna see where else you're gonna get that much power, Captain.
