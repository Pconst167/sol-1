7 BWMS was created as an electronic bill board. BWMS is a privately owned
8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system. As the system is
10 privately owned, I retain the right to remove any and all messages which
11 I may find offensive. Because of the limited size of the system, it will be
12 periodically purged of messages. (only 629 lines of data can be saved)
13 To leave a message, type 'ENTER' and use ctrl/C or break to get out of the
14 ENTER mode. The message is automatically stored. If after entering the
15 message you find you made a mistake, use the replace command to replace
16 the line. To exit from the system, type 'OFF' then hang up.

21 Hi All,  it's lonely at the top.  An old Latin saying,

24 Here's one for you Pascal programmers...

30 	This board is a really great concept.  Where else can anybody
31 write something and have at least one other person (Mikey) read it?
32 Good Job Mikey, I really like your board.

90     Perhaps it ought to be mentioned to n one in particular, that this system
91 is lacking in an abundance of space. As is mentioned in the opening message of
92 both disks,"only 629 lines" that can be used. 
93     Most important in that phrase is the term only. Although it often seems
94 that 629 lines is a large size for each disk, it could be very much bigger with
95 a slightly more conservative use of it. Things like taking up lines just to say
96 that this is a marker, or that this is only checking in are wastefull.
97     Even setting off partitions between different parts of an entry can be done
98 very wastefully if no attention is paid to the size of space being abused.
99     I am only worried that this is a trend and the enjoyment one gets out of
100 each disk is somehow being diluted ( At least for me ) because of seeing what I
101 consider an enormous amount of spce being taken up for no reason at all.
102     It can be blamed on enter only, that because you cannot delete linmes when
103 you find that you did not want them entered. This is possible, but since yoou
104 cannot delete them, you must be carefull about entering them.
105 
106     8AICFP<, I am paying you attention. I am sure we all are. Say, why for doo
107 you use commas the same way Tilean uses periods? No offense is intended, simple
108 curiosity though.
109     ADRIAN, are you alright? It did not seem in yor story that you were. If you
110 want to speak to someone about it, then please go on ahead and say so here. I
111 already have made a not of your name, and you will receive a message from me
112 after a bit.
113     NINJA, do you still ferry across these waters? It has been a long time, my
114 friend since we have talked to one another. Will you not welcome me on my
115 return?

119         After He Tells Her He Is Not Happy
120 
121 He is jovial now, overly so, and offers me pancakes
122 instead of sympathy.
123 I can tell from his tone he is
124 free from the burden of trying to care
125 but too kind to ask me to leave.
126 I practice holding my breath and stare at the wall--
127 he says we might be out of milk and hands
128 me my bear when I sit up
129 and try not to scream.
130 I wish he would go to the kitchen so I could cry.
131 He does,
132 so I do.
133 When I hear myself I sound like a child afraid.
134 I feel last night's stickiness on my thigh
135 and want a shower
136 while he putters in the kitchen.
137 
138 The shower is temperamental
139 and hoards hot water.
140 He joins me as I undress;
141 he is quick and shucks his
142 jeans and sweater
143 before I hang my bathrobe on the hook.
144 He has fiddled with the hot water--
145 never quite satisfied--
146 He has fiddled with the faucet--
147 never quite satisfied--
148 so I slip between the drops
149 and turn the knob 
150 this way
151 and that
152 until I find a pleasant scald.
153 
154 He hogs the stream;
155 his longish curls relax and hug his neck.
156 He is an unwashed Jesus bathing;
157 if I look I might see stigmata,
158 but for now I stand outside the spray
159 and mark my palms with new moon nails.
160 
161 When he remembers I am there
162 he puts his long hands on my hips
163 and slips a smile to me.
164 I back into the water,
165 wash myself of him,
166 slide down the side
167 of the shower to the floor.
168 If I could continue down the drain
169 I would,
170 but I sit and watch his kneew instead
171 until he crouches in the stall,
172 a too-tall bird,
173 the nest too small
174 and makes his hands a hat 
175 to keep the hot rain out.
176 
177 He wants to know
178 Am I ready to go?
179 I tell him
180 In a minute.
181 and he watches as I lick my lips,
182 tasting copper pipes.
183 
184 Sometimes in the dark
185 he's kiss my cheek
186 to test for tears.
187 
188 The salt betrays.
189 
190 If he kissed me now
191 he'd only taste tap water.

248 I have had reason to create a Legion of my own. Recently something, or 
249  someONE has taken away the attention I have been paying to myself, and I
250  have been allowing my responsibilities to slacken in the entry of these
251  diverse catagories. I will try to steal away some precious time from her
252  in order that I may be kept "up to date" here.
253 kathy"d": sure. why not? i'll put another notch in my pen as to the number

263 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     The Young Master West
264 (This may not flow too well, I don't have the second half of the last
265  entry available to refer to any longer.)
266      "What do you mean that we BOTH have a lesson to learn?"
267      All of a sudden a blank look came over the pipers face as he began tspeak.
268      "You, in your own way, must learn to ask for what you want. You must come
269 to know how and when to ask for it. From our short meeting I have noticed that
270 you are on your way. You know what you want, but must learn to voice your
271 desires." He paused before continuing.     "I...  I used to believe that I once
272 knew this. Now I know where I stand, and know the path I must take to remedy my
273 shortcoming. I must travel this path soon." 
274      The piper's head then bobbed and he wiped his face as if waking from a
275 short sleep, the life returning to his eyes.
276      "I hope that these few words are not too vague for you. They are the ones
277 that come to mind, and they have expressed what I had meant to say the way I
278 wanted to say it."
279      The young Master West could tell that the piper had wanted to say more but
280 was restraining himself so as not to cause any further confusion.
281      "No sir," he said. "Your words are quite clear. My friend Georgina told me
282 that once. I didn't know what she meant then, I do now." The boy shifted in his
283 chair as a new light began to shine over the table at which they sat.
284      "My father once told me that Knowledge is the presence of information, and
285 that Wisdom is the ability that uses that knowledge. What he has said now makes
286 sence to me...
287      "Your father should be proud of you." complimented the piper.
288      "I wish he were. I don't even know where he is today..." thought the young
289 Master West.
290      Another hour passed as more bits of knowledge became wisdom. As time went
291 on, the piper had procurred for the boy a cot that he could use for the night.
292      Having felt a slight sence of accomplishment, the piper then left the Inn.
293 He left it behind so that he may go toward the path destined for him. 
294 To his reunion...
295 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
296 #I wish he were. I don't even know where he is today...#

322 to be no driving force behind it all save the thrill of the hunt, and the
323 mad desire for power and control. Are we to unravel some deadly conspiracy,
324 or are the underlying motivations alwasy to remain a mystery? International

336 An interesting surprise has awaited my return. Two words that can bring so much

340 There had been a scare in the peanutbutter corner of the Market, but nothing
341 that would shake its foundation. The pace of the day continued at a furious
342 streak. Jack was performing more steadily in the pit than Tina first hoped.
343 The constant variation of the price on the indicator lead Jack to and from
344 his purchases, but the price still moved in a slow motion downwards. Soon the
345 price would stabalize due to the nature of being all in a days trading, and
346 the closing price would be a boost to the current slump.
347      "These numbers! All theese numbers! I swear I'll have nightmares for a
348 week, I know it!" This thought recurred within Jacks mind even though he kept
349 his mouth shut, his eyes open, and the markers coming in.
350      "I don't understand how he can take all of this in stride," thought Tina
351 in concern for Jack. "He doesn't even show a sign of struggle." Although not
352 close to him, she began to feel a deeper respect for him, for his stamina.
353      Meanwhile, as things continued to move "smoothly" on the floor, the 
354 instigator of what caused Tina's outbreak of fear earlier slithered across
355 the room and out the door to the closest phone he could find that didn't
356 require he feed it one of his precious coins.
357      "Yea. Hello? Get me somebody from Beatrice... Tell 'em it's Mitchell
358 calling. Yea, Gary Mitchell. I'll wait." He was almost too crafty.
359      For Jack and Tina the day seemed to continue at its painfully slow
360 pace, but eventually it came time for all markers to be registered and all
361 trades to conclude. A light dinner and a good nights sleep would do them both
362 good. But before things could come to a stop, Jack and Tina would first have
363 to establish contact with Marci and Tony to confirm the second half of the 
364 operation would procede as scheduled.
365      "O.K. Tony, You still there?" came the voice over the phone.
366      "Yes, I'm still here. Where'd you think I'd go? The Moon?" answered Tony.
367      "Don't be an ass now Tony, I was just calling to let you in on the days
368 events. The price fluctuated as we hadn't expected, but we wound up with
369 over five thousand more shares than we figured on." reported Tina.
370      "Alright, I'm sorry. We're supposed to leave now then, I guess. If we
371 get out of here if five minutes, we should get to the Plant in twenty minutes,
372 and should be back in about three hours. Does that sound right?"
373      "That's how it worked out before. And when you get back to the condo?
374 Don't bother telling me how it went unless you botch it. I'm too tired to 
375 listen to details in my sleep. And Jack should be gone from this world by the
376 time we make it back, it was hell in there today." The fatigue was heard in 
377 Tina's voice, Tony didn't persue it any farther.
378      For Jack, Tina, and Gary the day was at an end. For Marci, Tony, and
379 "Jimmy" the night was just beginning. If the plans would click, then "Jimmy"
380 and the competition would both disappear in the night. It had to work.
381 It just had to...

436 
437     I slid the book back into the slots prepared for it so long ago.  In a
438 wide canvas binder, with a leather wrap to close it.  The satchel looked
439 nearly as old as the leafed books it carried.  And as well worn with time
440 and the duties of knowledge and wisdom.
441     Carefully minding the covers of the books, it slid finally into place
442 wityh the other books.  At least twelve of them, and all were marked with a
443 saying that sounded similar in at least some sordid manner.
444     I sighed slowly as it fitted and releived myself with another tip of the
445 large tankart provided me by my rather odd guest.  I almost answered the
446 question posefd to me by him, and then I considered all the merits of the
447 thing that had not presented themselves to me originally.
448 
449     "I am not sure why, it must be some trait learned early on.  I care for
450 the books as if they as important as I am because they are what I am.  I am
451 nothing if it is not what those books provide me with."  Enunciatedthe Sage,
452 trying to carefully place his words so that his companion would understand.
453 And not be dreadfully confused by them, as sometimes he managed to do.
454     The odd companion who benefacted the drinks asked again why the Sage did
455 so much in order to be tied to those books?  And why oh why, did he withstand
456 so very much in the way of insult for not saying what he thought often?
457     "I have seen you,"  Said the companion, turning in his cloak of silvered
458 chain, and continued "you sit and listen, then write something in one of your
459 notebooks.  Why do you sit and listen and never say anything?"
460 
461     Again the Sage tried as hard as he possibly could to make sense out of what
462 he was going to say; for it would be difficult to explain.  "Often it serves
463 my purpose to let the normal chain of conversation go uninterupted by my points
464 or my personal opinions, or even corrections.  I may be able to reform the
465 debate at hand, but perhaps there is no need to do this.  Perhaps it would be
466 quite unkind to upstage the debaters.  I would rather not offend, if you will."
467 
468     "But what is the debate if everyone is scared to enter into the thing?  It
469 lacks sense to say that you will not interfere in something, which cannot
470 begin if you do not?!"  Now the figure was more and more flustered.  This odd
471 companion did not like to not understand things that others considered quite
472 obvious to anyone with brains.
473     "It is not the interruption of debates that strikes up one, it is the first
474 expression of disagreement that does it, and then a debate begins.  Once one is
475 started, the only reason for me to interrupt is if I have a question.  Is this
476 not as it ought to be, for all debates?"  The Sage looked off into the windows
477 reflecting white bleary clouds.  The Sage pondered his own words, as he so
478 often did.
479 
480     "It is almost not fair to ask me this,"  Said the odd one sitting over to
481 another seat at this table, " it is as if you are laying blame for all the loud
482 and angry debates on me.  I assure you, I am not one of those that calls a
483 raging argument a debate.  In deferrence to facts that indicates the precense
484 of anger and blind stupidity.  I am not to blame for all this."
485     The Sage sorreled for a moment then apologized for making this impression
486 on his kind companion.  "I am sorry to make it seem thus, what I mean to end up
487 saying is that all debates ought to be questiuons and answers, which in turn
488 create other questions that ought to be answered.  It is all a marvelous and
489 quaint concept, being lost in trhe fashion of the times."  The Sage sagged his
490 head as to make the drinking easier.  Not that water flavored by leaves that
491 were collected from outside the Inn was going to douse any sorrows.
492     And yet, the objective idea that it was going to, seemed to calm everyone
493 from what had just transpired.  A debate of neat proportions, eh?

497 Hello kathyd, it's great to see that you live and are well. Now I will be able
498 to stop fending off this nagging desire to bed myself and be fresh for the 
499 morrow. If I had not saw your words I would have not been able to enter that world of slumber peacefully but now it looks 
500 like the need of tablet is no more. By the by, someone has been defaming your
501 beautiful postscripts by stating many falsehoods about the eating of commoners
502 food, such as OREOs et al. Now I know this could not have been true, for no
503 hands that touched such vile elements could have possibly typed the words I have
504 seen with the name kathyd. Caviar, imported breadfruits, oriental beef yes, oreo no!!!!

508         Enjoy the days of skiing, and oh, like you said, let the

519 Uh, it seems kinda dark. Like, I havn't been near a terminal for so long.
520 the keys seem to be as old friends, but they can not be. Strange that
521 being away from a terminal for so long can cause total brain decay. And 
522 on the note of brain decay.....
523 RISK!!!! That sorred game, I tell you, I met some old friends on a bus, I was 
524 going home, nice and peacefull, when, when... it is simply too horrible to 
525 contemplate. None the less I found myself as the black player in that filthy
526 game. It is as a drug, taking control of your mind and making you stay up 
527 until(quick look at watch) 6:38 A.M. when you know that people are expecting
528 you to be places in 20 min. V.O.L. was served, pizza consumed, and other things.
529 I am going to the hospital now, they have decided that my little joke of killing
530 the poor sucker who won was is bad taste. Such is life. My next entry may very
531 well be from Damish. Until then, stay away from those RISK games!

535 Piper : Ah! Good luck. I found out the prof's phone number at work (he works at Tek) and I gave him a call. It turns

537  telling him. I have an appointment with him Monday at 10am. I am to bring ALL of my listings and documentation for the
538  project. It looks like things may be changing for the better. Thanks for your advice. I'll probably be calling you
539  after Monday sometime, to let you know how the meeting went.

578 I am very sorry to be butting in like this, as I know you are all people with fine imaginations and well developed
579 characters, but it occurs to me that it might be better if we all filed up one drive before we began to use an-
580 other. I call up at hideous hours of the night and get print-outs of the good stuff, and having stuff added onto
581 two different drives often screws me up as to what I have and what I don't have. I am only making this comment 
582 in behalf of what i perceive to be Order.
583 And another thing, to but into another subject in which I don't belong, the Explosion-Combustion Debate, I think
584 I just might have the answer. An explosion, the way we think of it, is an instantaneous combustion. In an engine,
585 the whole blob of gas-air mixture DOES NOT explode by that definition! It does take time for the combustion to 
586 travel from the spark plug end of the chamber to the other end, but that time is so short it is almost negli-
587 gable. And so, technically, the Slow-Burners are right! But practically, the Exploders are right, too!
588 My only point in writing this essay is to possibly clear up a point, add some fuel to the fire, get insulted, or
589 whatever. I hope my comments on this subject are taken in the manner in which I meant for them to be taken.
590 If you are reading this, thank you for your time. Please do not think I am a stupid ignoramus rambling on.
