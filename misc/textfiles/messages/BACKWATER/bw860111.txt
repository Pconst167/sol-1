49 Strephon kissed me in the spring,
50    Robin in the fall,
51 But Colin only looked at me
52    And never kissed at all.
53 Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,
54    Robin's lost in play,
55 But the kiss in Colin's eyes
56    Haunts me night and day.

58 THE ARROW AND THE SONG
59 
60 I shot an arrow into the air,
61 It fell to earth, I know not where;
62 For, so swiftly it flew, the sight
63 Could not follow it in its flight.
64 
65 I breathed a song into the air,
66 It fell to earth, I know not where;
67 For who has sight so keen and strong,
68 That it can follow the flight of song?   
69 
70 Long, long afterward, in an oak
71 I found the arrow, still unbroke;
72 And the song, from beginning to end,
73 I found again in the heart of a friend.

89 all net agents like to consider themselves as intelligent, inteellectual,
90 well-trained, and above everything else, better than the rest of us.
91 their sneers at spelling and how we are taking their spelling with us and into
92 the gutter, is only an example.  others can be cited, but that would get bloody
93 and i fear i will stain a few shirts and ties as it is.
94 once you only had to snap nets codes to enter it.  to do that you went down to
95 the Library, central branch, and read three books.  like ian did once.
96 now if you break the code, you are an imposter.  well, knock one up for an
97 imposter who has made net level four obsolete, without officially knowing it.
98 and if i thought any of you had it in you, i would hope you'd feel sorry.

101 This is true. (By the way, there is a key on most keyboards that says "shift"
102 and if you hold it down while pressing a letter key it will echo a capital
103 letter. LIKE THIS. Try it, you like it.
104 This code stuff is the result of one Net Operative who likes games, but has
105 the consistency of abused J-ELLO. (Lime flavor). Heis an unselfidentified 
106 particle of flotsam swaying perpetually in a vascillating sea of self inflicted
107 indifference. His self esteem was lost in a flood which destroyed his childhood
108 home, and his memories of his mother, hence he seeks acceptance from others
109 He masturbates several times a day, while envisioning,fantisising, sexual 
110 intercourse with women he has not the courage to speak to. He is fat and ugly.
111 Give him a break. Don't feel sorry for him. If you have a sister you don't
112 like, introduce them. He really isn't a BAD guy.

115      This one came to me while I was trying to get somebody on the phone the other night. Granted, I exaggerated for
116 effect, but hasn't anybody else felt the same way in the same situation sometimes?
117      P.S. What do you think of the experimental format? I doubt you'll be seeing a whole lot of it.
118 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
119      Time: 10:14 AM
120      Phone: "Beep... beep... beep..."
121      Me: What is this? I told her I'd call on my morning break. Who the hell would she be talking to at this hour?
122 Nuts. Gotta get back to work.
123 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
124      Time: 11:56 AM
125      Phone: "Beep... beep... beep..."
126      Me: Still? For crying out loud! Who would she be talking to for two whole hours? Every day she tells me to call
127 and I call but how can I get through if the thing's busy all the time? Now I'll have to wait 'til I get back from
128 lunch. Wish I had time to stop by.
129 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
130      Time: 12:46 PM
131      Phone: "Beep... beep.. beep..."
132      Me: Son of a B! Damn. Maybe something's wrong. I'll call Mrs. Price next door and see if she'll check.
133      Phone: "Brrr... Brrr... *click* Hello?"
134      Me: "Hello, Mrs. Price? This is Dave, your neighbor. I've been trying to call my wife all morning and the phone's
135 been busy. I was just wondering if you'd just take a look for me and see if everything's all right."
136      Phone: "Certainly, I'll... Wait a minute. I can see her from my window. She's sitting in the kitchen, talking on
137 the phone. Everything look's fine from here."
138      Me: Sigh. "Thank you very much."
139 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
140      Time: 2:04 PM
141      Phone: "Beep... beep... beep..."
142      Me: Goddammit! Who the hell's she talking to? She's there alone all day long... alone... Maybe she's seeing
143 somebody behind my back. Maybe that kid that delivers groceries, 19 years old and 180 pounds of solid tanned muscle! Or
144 maybe that damn TV repair man! She mentioned something about him coming over today to fix the horizontal hold. Maybe
145 that ain't all he's fixing. Maybe she left the phone off the hook so as not to be disturbed. I can't leave, and now I
146 gotta go through the rest of the day thinking about that! S**T!
147 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
148      Time: 4:51 PM
149      Phone: "Brrr... Brrr... Brrr..."
150      Me: That's fifteen rings. She's not there. I knew it! I'll kill her! I'm going to go home, get my gun, and blow
151 her goddamn brains out! And that Goddamn TV man. Or the delivery boy. Hell, I'll waste 'em both, just to be sure! And
152 that cheap, no good, dirty, lousy sl-
153      Phone: "*click* Hello?"
154      Me: "Uhhh... H-h-h-hello?"
155      Phone: "Dave! Oh, my god, I just realized! Oh, I'm so sorry! My mother called this morning, saying she was coming
156 to visit for a week. I know how well the two of you get along, and I tried to talk her out of it. It's been such a long
157 time since I talked to her and our conversation kept getting off the subject but after six hours I convinced her that
158 it really wasn't a good time to come. I really wanted her to visit but I knew it would drive you crazy. I'm sorry I
159 took so long to answer but I was in the back of the house vacuuming and couldn't hear the bell."
160      Me: "Uh... uh..."
161      Phone: "What's the matter, dear? You sound funny."
162      Me: "Ohhhh... nothing. Nothing at all. I was just worried 'cause I couldn't reach you."
163      Phone: "You're sweet. Will you be home soon?"
164      Me: "Right away. They left me to lock up but I thought I'd call first."
165      Phone: "Okay, dear. I'm fixing your favorite tonight. Hurry home. I love you."
166      Me: "I love you too."
167 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
168      Time: 8:58 AM (the next morning.)
169      My boss: "Dave. You were here after I left. Do you have any idea who ripped the phone in my office out of the wall
170 last night?"

180 Oh, Silverman, you DO have a sense of humor. Why did you waste your talent on
181 a horror story in the first place? Not only was the above story oh-so true,
182 but it conveyed a story with an unusual point of view, which is refreshing
183 indeed. Before I slobber all over you and you get a big head, just remember 
184 that you've also proven that you  can
185 write just-ok stuff. But stay funny... humor is a very elusive thing and it's
186 a real gift when you can do it.....

Washington, January 12
202 The new Director dropped into his new chair.  Sure of the latest fashions,
203 he was comfortable in his three-piece suit.  Steadily he depressed a thin
204 red key into the shiny desk surface.  A monitor rose from the black top and
205 a keyboard clicked into place also.  A secretary entered the office.  If
206 the new Director had not been perplexed, he might have noticed.
207 "An appointment, Director."
208 "What?  Oh, right."
209 "Should I go get them, Director?"
210 He depressed another slim red key and a graphic of the world showed on the
211 table top.  Sattelite charts, oceanographic charts and aeronautical maps
212 were overlaid there.  Pressing keys, it all disappeared in an instant.
213 "Director?"
214 "Sorry. Please send them in."
215 The monitor and keyboard submereged into the desk as the two men entered.
216 A stenographer followed and seated herself discretely near the Director.
217 She prepared her pad while the three men shook hands over the table.
218 "Sit down, gentlemen."
219 One of the men lumbered into a chair.  The other sat down gingerly and made
220 himself comfortable at last.  Neither knew what to say first.
221 "Now.  Explain the McKane account."
222 The obeise one decided to speak first.  As he started talking the other one
223 interrupted loudly.
224 "The Agency owes him.  When Congress denied us part of the 1983 budget, he-
225 donated it."
226 The Director frowned.
227 "We took him into the Alps after the last engagement with the Net.  The ass
228 nailed us.  He threatened full ddisclosure to Congress about fiscal 1983."
229 "Disperse the McKane organization."
230 "If he sends fiscal 1983 to Congress?"
231 "Adopt Delta Five."
232 The Director was ruthless.  Senators Duncan and Smithfield promised support
233 for the agency as long as Hart got information on the Presidency. President
234 Reagan was easily deceived anyway.  The Agency was his.
235 
236 nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
237 
238 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
239      The ocean waves crash unceasingly against the rocky shore. 
240 Slowly eating away at the rock as it has for eons.  Creating the 
241 tiny grains of sand to line the beach. 
242 
243      On the horizon a dark speck can be seen if one were to look 
244 closly.  Bobing up and down with the waves, now appearing, and 
245 now gone from sight.  
246      As the hours pass, slowly the speck drifts closer with the 
247 currents.  In time details can be made out by those with eyes 
248 sharp enough to do so.  A make-shift raft built from floatsome, 
249 the remains of some disaster. 
250      As more time passes and the raft drifts closer.  Now a 
251 figure can be seen laying prone on the raft partially covered, a 
252 futile attempt to fight off the wind swept seas. 
253      This close to shore the waves begin to break into white 
254 caps, jostling the raft and its occupant.  Stirring and then 
255 rising as a result of the unusual activity, the figure looks up 
256 to see what is happening.  Confusion is apparent at first, 
257 brushing the ragged mane of matted hair aside the figure finally 
258 sees the nearby shore line and looks on uncomprehending of its 
259 meaning. 
260      Abruptly the raft strikes a submerged rock, and its 
261 occupant is thrown into the water. Sputering seawater he raises 
262 back up out of the water.  Climbing aboard, he begins to collect 
263 what remains of his few posessions into a bundle, stopping for a 
264 period of time within the crudely built shelter.  Then sitting 
265 at the front of the raft, waits for the shore line to be closer, 
266 knowing that soon he must leave this raft that has been his home 
267 for these many months.  Soon it will break up as it is driven 
268 among the rock lined shore. 
269      As the raft approaches another rock, this one quite visible 
270 above the pounding surf, he dives off to the side and watches 
271 quietly as his home of so many months is destroyed in a few 
272 swift blows against the rocks.  Struggling on-ward in the 
273 crashing waves, he swims for the shore that is now quite near. 
274      Twice he is nearly dashed against the rock strewn shore. 
275 The third time he is not so fortunate, and the waves drive him 
276 unmercifully against the large rock he is unable to avoid 
277 knocking the breath from him.  Unable to breath, unable to move, 
278 he hangs against the bracken covered rock.  Again the sea 
279 crashes around him, driving him once again against the unyelding 
280 barier of the rock, causing him to this time lose his small 
281 parcel of posessions. 
282      Knowing that he cannot continue to stay and let the 
283 crashing surf beat against him, or the next time might be the 
284 last, he lets loose and allows the frothing waves to carry him 
285 to the rocky shore. 
286      Stumbling among the rocks, and repeatedly thrown down by 
287 the crashing waves, finally he reaches the small patch of sand 
288 just outside the waves reach.  Turning, he reaches out, 
289 beaconing for someone that does not exist.  Reaching out to a 
290 shadow. offering help that is not wanted or taken.  So long had 
291 he struggled and waited to find the safty and security of land.
292      But the passing of time has had its toll, as he calls out 
293 to an imaginary friend.  Begging her to pass from the sea of 
294 emotional turbulance, to dare to risk the rocks to gain the 
295 solid ground of land.  It becomes obvious that the answer he 
296 desires is not forthcoming as he collapses on the sand, great 
297 sobs shake his body.  The wind and rain wash away the tears and 
298 carry them to the sea.  No one would ever know the feelings of 
299 pain and loss that are felt were it not for the gently echoing 
300 sobs that filled the small cove.  A small shivering figure 
301 sitting alone on a remote wind swept beach.
302 
303      After a period of time, a man in a gray-blue uniform 
304 bareing a leather satchel approaches the raft's one time 
305 occupant. Reaching into the bag, the man digs out a small brown 
306 envelope and throws it down to him saying, "Here, this is for 
307 you." 
308      Picking up the envelope, he turns it over and then sees the 
309 inscription on the front "To: Occupant".
310 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Elger EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
311 
312 --------------------------------------------------------
313 A touching tale with a weird ending. But, I am reminded 
314 of a saying, perhaps it will help. Then again maybe not, 
315 but here it is anyway. 
316 
317 If you love something, let it go. 
318 If it comes back, it is your's. 
319 If it does not, it never was.
320 
321 Let go of your past, look to the future. In the words of
322 yet another saying. (I seem to be full of sayings don't I?)
323 
324 Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life.

327 Swamp Gas (words & music: Leslie Fish)
328 I was walkin' my watchman's rounds one night
]329 When up in the sky I saw this flaming light.
330 It looked like a soup bowl flyin' upside-down,
331 And a hundred people must've seen it cross our town,
332 But of all the folks questioned by the local fuzz
333 Not one of them would call it what they knew it was...
334 They said it was:
335 Chorus:	Swamp gas...swamp gas...swamp gas...swamp gas...
336 	Swamp gas, oh yeah, but I know what I've seen.
337 I saw the thing settle in an open yard.
338 It was glowing and shiny, kinda sleek and hard.
339 I looked it over closely so I wouldn't forget,
340 And I'm sure it was nothing that this world's made yet.
341 I woke up all the neighbors, made 'em look and see,
342 And as soon as they could talk again, they said to me:
343 "You know, that's just...
344 	CHORUS
345 Then out of the saucer came this little green guy,
346 And he asked us for some water, 'cause his tanks had gone dry.
347 He lifted up a building roof, looked in, and said: "Aak!"
348 Then he saw that we were worried, so he put it back.
349 He thanked us for the water, got in, and took off,
350 And behind me, I heard someone discreetly cough,
351 "You know, that was...
352 	CHORUS
353 So I called up the cops and tried to explain,
354 And while they called the Air Force, they called me insane.
355 I hauled in fifty people who had seen it too,
356 So they shut up fast and let the experts through.
357 But the answer from the experts raised a lot of smiles,
358 'Cause there's no swamp nearer three hundred miles.
359 But they called it...
360 	CHORUS
361 So I went back to the cops and said it was a crime
362 That the government shoiuld lie so much of the time.
363 I guess a lot of people must've thought so too,
364 'Cause just then a bomb down in the basement blew.
365 And as half of the station up and flew away,
366 I could swear that I heard someone below me say,
367 "You know, this is...
368 	CHORUS
369 Now the flying building took its time in coming down,
370 And it scattered bits and pieces over half of our town.
371 And I'm here only 'cause a tall pine tree
372 And its big soft branches made a net for me.
373 Way up there in the branches I could sway and swing,
374 And the people walking past didn't see a thing.
375 They said I was...
376 	CHORUS
377 Now, why do they try to tell you that tale,
378 And tell you to believe it or go to jail?
379 Or worse, they'll send you packing to the funny farm.
380 'Cause if they can tell you lies about what happens next door,
381 Don't you know that when you ask about the latest war,
382 They'll tell you it's...
383 	CHORUS
384 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
385 01010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
386 Ian may have been a bit hard on the second one of the would-be NET agents,
387 but the first one only *thinks* he knows the code! What he thinks is the
388 code is only a *portion* of it (this leads to sections of his msgs being
389 garbage)

397 To: Ian MacHinery
398 From: NEXUS
399 Subject: Cipher on last disk
400 Ian, ordinarily NEXUS would do nothing to prevent any discomfort you may be
401 suffering, but NEXUS believes that the situation should be clarified to others.
402 One: No member of NET sent the 22 lines, including borders, of the lower case
403 cipher on the last disk.  Any complaints should be directed to UNDERGROUND,
404 not NET.  Two: This message was NOT a worthless m"I'll be at the meeting", but
405 valuable information.  Three: This cipher is the only message UNDERGROUND has
406 placed on the last several disks.   NEXUS would prefer another means of sending
407 ciphertext, but alas, none is available.  Four: Such transmissions shall be
408 kept to the barest minimum.
409 Thank you for your tolerance.  NEXUS out.

414 mr. silverman you are quite a fine writer and i enjoy your stories.
415 Please keep up the good work.  many thanks.

420 I think our friend Mr. Purvis has been hiding out too long; he's showing
421 signs of mass paranoia.  Not only is he on a one man vigil against Delta V,
422 he seems to be seeing communism everywhere.  Maybe growing up in the
423 middle of the McCarthy scare is finally coming out in him.  Watch out, he'll
424 start writing up his 'black lists'...

426 Miss Nomer re-read the words she had scribbled on the pink message form.
427 She had written is as accurately as she could, but the roar in the background made it hard to understand the muffled v
428 ce on the other end of the phone. It looked important, and she pressed the intercom button for the comunications section
429 "Yes sir, just a couple minutes ago. It says 'EIGHTHBIT/HASSADICAWARE/TRIXASAHRS/LOOKFORBODYBLACKFE2/DELPHI', sir."
430 A few minutes later, the message was broadcast on a special NET frequency. [*=*] [*=*] DELTA FIVE [*=*] [*=*] [*=*]

449      COMMUNIST CONSPIRACY DEEPENS
450 
451 By Franklin Pervis
452 
453 Most upstanding and well-informed Americans are well aware of the evil threat that pervades our land.
454 The word 'Communism' has almost become taken for granted now, the dread it should bring has almost been
455 lost to the new generations. In past weeks, I have informed the public of a menace as terrifying as the Communist
456 conspiracy to take over our way of life, Delta V. 
457 My sources now tell me that Delta V has received direct payments from deep within the Kremlin. We have copies
458 of two cancelled checks, drawn on the Moscow National Bank from the account of one Vladimir Uralinianski, for
459 the sum of $200,000 US dollars each.
460 This evidence of Delta V's Communist ties confirms our knowledge that he must be tracked down and eliminated.
461 Immediately.
462 Our sources also indicate that Delta V has dealt with the following people, either secretly or in quick
463 rendezvous' across the country:
464 Miss Jean Marple. Mr. Frank Li; Mr. John Buck; Mr. Ivan Seaner; Mrs. Rose Bowles; Mr. Jack Kaughman; 
465 Ms. Cicely Initaly; Mr. Delbert Johnston, Mr. Thorton Fogbottom; (continued pages 4, 5, and 6)

468 Tilean: The truth about your alleged code breaking is known. Shame on you for
469 entering such a message as the one above. Shame on you for telling an untruth.
470 Shame on you for not acting more mature. In other words, Shame Shame Shame!

472 					NATIONAL ENQUIRER
473 Predictions for 1986 by Jean Dixon!
474 
475 Cut-throat newspaper man and 1985 winner of the Yellow Journalism Award Franklin Pervis will marry Joan Collins
476 in early 1986, but an annullment will be announced the next day. Joan will give her reason as 'I was so
477 disapointed on our wedding night. It was like listening to some marketing guy. He just sat on the edge of
478 the bed telling me how good it would be!'
479 
480 A young couple living in Anytown USA will win the Parants-of-the-Year award for 1985. The award will be
481 presented in New York City on March 15th, 1986. The selection committee will be quoted as saying 'Never in the
482 history of this award has a more deserving couple been our receipient. Our lucky parents have instilled good
483 American values of kindness, love, and above all honesty, in the mind of their child. We are very proud of 
484 this year's winners.
485 
486 1986 will also see many earthquakes, fires, wind and hail storms, hurricans, and bomb blasts that will kill 
487 hundreds of nameless faceless writer-assassins who inhabit a computer hangout known as the Backwater Inn. Several
488 Backwater irregulars will only go as far as saying, 'It must have been an act of God....Or some other local
489 diety.'
490 
491 The Alternate World computer system will again return to AE format, and then change during the summer of 1986.
492 The management of Alternate World will refuse comment of the latest change, except to say 'AW is NOT an AE!'
493 
494 The Chicago Bears will smash the New England Patriots in the upcoming Super Bowl. Chicago coach Mike Ditka will
495 say after the game, 'I still can't believe how easy that was.'
496 
497 Jim Bell, Portland Oregon area hardware hacker, will crank the speed of his liquid helium cooled Z80 to 25 mhz.
498 Unfortunately, his coolent tank will rupture, and when the liquid reaches the super-hot Z80, the entire casing
499 will explode, leveling all houses within one city block, and breaking windows as far as 5 miles away. By some
500 miracle, no one will be hurt in the explosion. Another local hacker will be overheard as saying '...hand of God.'
501 
502 Also in the Portland Area, The Messenger, a BBS long besieged by locak crackers and repeated attempts of
503 sabotage by The Phone Company, will finally
504 return from the ashes like a Pheonix, with 2400 baud capability, 10 megabytes of online disk storage, and three
505 multi user capability. It will rise in popularity until it is second only to THE OMEGA QUADRANT in
506 calls per day.
507 
508 Still on the computer front, Apple Computer will fire John Scully, and bring in Lee Iacoca, lured for big bucks
509 from the chairmenship of Chrysler. Lee's first computer offering will be the highly acclaimed Blackintosh, a
510 slick black box with '1 million bits of storage, and Sinclair ZX81 compatibility.'
511 
512 Not to be outdone, IBM will announce the IBM PCjr Ewing, a computer specifically built for oil millionaires and 
513 other big corporate pundits. The PCjr Ewing will have the ability to cheat, steal, and destroy competitor's
514 electronically stored data.
515 
516 While the two continual microcomputer front runners continue to battle each other, a new company, I.C. Computers
517 will emerge as the third largest computer retailer in the country, mainly on the strength of its I.C.U. computer/
518 surveillance machine, priced at only $699.95, the I.C.U. will totally revitalize the neighbor-versus-neighbor
519 mentality of the late 50's. With its advanced peek-a-boo (tm) mode for looking in on unsuspecting neighbors
520 the I.C.U. will create mass buying sprees where entire city blocks will arm themselves with the unit, so no
521 single occupant has an advantage over any other.
522 
523 In the entertainment world, who will still be reeling over the Purvis/Collins annullment trial, the movie 
524 industry will see a reawakening from its dulldrum late '85-early '86 business. Sly Stallone and Steven
525 Spielberg will be the two men chiefly responsible for the upswing with their Mega-hit, 'Rambo meets ET.' The
526 daring post-traumatic shock Rambo is sent to ET's world in order to save the little guy and return the 
527 government to the hands of the aliens it belonged to before the power was usurped by the Mohawkens, whose leader
528 is masterfully played by best supporting actor winner, Mr. T. The movie will gross over $700 million in domestic
529 rentals alone.
530 
531 Lionel Ritchie, Dolly Pardon, Michael Jackson, Cindi Lauper, The Statler Brothers, Madonna, The Judds, Quiet
532 Riot, and Glen Frye will all appear on stage together in August on '86 for a special benefit concert for the
533 Bikini Islands, whose populace is still suffering the affects of The United States of America's H-bomb testing
534 is the early 1950's. The concert, which was dubbed 'Moola-aux-Guam', will raise over 25 million dollars of 
535 relief money, and will be the pattern for all fund raisers of the future. Bob Geldof will not be involved with
536 this particular project.
537 
538 But his group, the Boom Town Rats, will have the big album his of the year, with their double LP, "I Don't
539 Wanna." The album will become the watch-word for teenagers all over the world who are protesting treatment by
540 their parents, teachers, and clergymen. Similar to Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' in scope and breadth, the nations'
541 young will return to a 60's style revolution of 'Turn on, Tune in, and Toke out', the name of one of the
542 songs on "I Don't Wanna." Record sales will approach 30 million, making it the biggest hit since the Bee Gee's
543 Saturday Night Fever soundtrack.
