 82              Nomination for the "Ten Best Censored Stories of 1987"
 83  
 84               THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  INTERNATIONAL OUTLAW
 85  
 86           On June 27, 1986, the International Court of Justice, under the
 87      auspices of the United Nations, handed down a decision that found the
 88      United States in violation of international law.  The decision called
 89      for the United States to cease its international illegal activities
 90      against Nicaragua. The Court's decision, 12-3, held that the U.S.
 91      support of the contras was illegal. A further decision, 14-1, held
 92      that U.S. mining of Nicaragua's harbors and distribution of a CIA
 93      assassination manual also violated international law.
 94           In 1987, while President Reagan was defending his contra policy,
 95      while Oliver North was telling contra stories to Congress, and while
 96      Secretary of State George Schultz was asking Congress for $270 million
 97      in contra aid, the U.S. media failed to inform the American public
 98      that the Reagan administration's efforts were illegal.
 99          In fact, the International Court of Justice decision against the
100      U.S. was, for all intents and purposes, a non-event in the U.S. media
101      in 1987.
102           This non-event status was never more evident that in the media's
103      failure to cover the November 12, 1987, U.N. General Assembly vote,
104      94-2, that called for "full and immediate compliance" with the World
105      Court's June 1986 decision. In particular, the General Assembly called
106      on the U.S. to cease funding its military activities against
107      Nicaragua.
108           The question of whether the U.S. government rejects international
109      adjudication as having a part in aiding peace, or whether the rule of
110      international law is valid, void, or only reserved for minor matters
111      was never really explored by the U.S. media in light of the World
112      Court and General Asesembly decisions in the United Nations.
113           The American public has been kept ignorant of this international
114      issue and its implications on U.S. policy toward Nicaragua largely
115      because of media indifference.

140 though because of something that was said on disk B:

146 and if someone there is using my name, I'm going to be truly irritated.

151 Oh say can you see...
152              To the Editor:  While George Bush is wrapping himself in the flag,
153 his advance staff's knowledge of flag etiquette is sorely lacking.  The flag 
154 used as a backdrop for Bush's speech Aug. 23 at Pioneer Courthouse Square
155 was set up the day before with the bottom two stripes dragging on the ground.
156     It was left that way even though the advance staff was notified by the 
157 director of the Square.  Not only was it left that way overnight, it was not
158 illuminated.
159     I suggest Bush's campaign spend 20 cents for the American Legion' pamphlet,
160 "Flag Etiquette", or look in the Boy Scout Handbook for the proper and
161 respectful  way to fly and display the flag.

368  
369                  THE TRAGEDY OF GRENADA SINCE OCTOBER 25, 1983
370  
371           While the media permit Ronald Reagan to cite Grenada as an
372      American success story, the people of Grenada aren't buying it. The
373      following description of what has happened in Grenada since the 1983
374      U.S. invasion was published last year by the Committee for Human
375      Rights in Grenada.
376  
377      1. Removal of price controls on food, cement, housing, and other
378      essentials of life.
379      2. Summary firings of Grenadian workers without notice, compensation,
380      or legal redress.
381      3. Unemployment now well over 50%.
382      4. Internationalist workers who previously provided free health
383      services deported.
384      5. Uncontrolled escalation of land, rent, and all prices.
385      6. Free medical, dental, optical care, and medicines, formerly
386      accessible to all Grenadians, now eliminated.
387      7. Grenadian graduates of Cuban and other socialist-nation
388      universities not allowed to practice in Grenada.
389      8. Open prostitution since arrival of U.S. troops.
390      9. Use of cocaine, heroin, and crack since invasion.
391     10. National Women's Organization, National Youth Organization, and the
392      Grenada Human Rights Organization eliminated.
393     11. Former institutions now diminished to point of uselessness include
394      independent, progressive union movement; free judiciary; and free and
395      independent media.
396     12. Severe devaluation of Grenadian dollar.
397     13. Grenada, whose economy was praised by the World Bank and the IMF in
398      Spring, 1983, had a $168 million debt as of March 28, 1986.
399  
400           Finally, the Committee reported in April, 1987, that the O.E.C.S.
401      (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States) occupying troops, trained
402      by the U.S. have returned in force to Grenada and that they are
403      directed by U.S. military officers, usually in civilian dress.
404      Ominously, the Committee adds "Their abuses are well known."
405  
406           The extent and inflammatory nature of the charges by the
407      Committee for Human Rights in Grenada surely deserve investigation by
408      the U.S. media.

597 We make the final assault, there is a great deal of fighting. Somehow the
598 wanderer is thrown thru space time.

600 "Seerve me!" The vieled one said in my mind. (But I knew it could not be the
601 vieled one, It did not do things this way.)
602  
603 "You have no power left, you are nothing. Only the sphere holds you together,
604 and soon it too will die because of lack of power!"
605  
606 "You are not the veiled one!" I screamed through the Astral wind. 
607  
608 "You are right, I did not think that my ruse would fool you, But chaos must
609 try many methods. Order is not good."
610  
611 "Chaos, I know of the force by that name, though I know nothing of you."
612  
613 "I am the force, I am chaos."
614  
615 "Why do you taunt me?"
616  
617 "That is my secret. Chaos is not without some wisdom."
618  
619 I could feel the last vestages of my being fadding. 
620  
621 "You could give the orb to the vieled one, that would relieve you of your 
622 burden." Chaos said.
623  
624 "NOoooooo!" I screamed in my final defiance.
625  
626 "Very well, you force me to act!"
627  
628 And as he said this I found myself on the lawn outside the Inn at the 
629 crossroads. I knew that the orb and I had gained a propor binding. But why
630 had the lord of Chaos done this?
631  
632 Pondering I entered the Inn and found a place to meditate.

726 Well Renee, This system is Kind of Different. All messages are entered one 
727 after the other. It can get confusing if peaple do not use proper borders.
728  
729 Backwater II is a very interesting board. You can do anything here, other 
730 then be a TWIT. (The sysop has some seriose problems with twits.)
731  
732 Have you tryed looking at disk b? Disk b is the one that has the lines
733 entered on the last disk. You see it by typing 'db' (Ignore the ', and hit
734 return.)
735  
736 Well, I guess thats all for now. I will be macking another story entry soon.

758 SINE OF LOVE
759 I SAW HER AS A MOST BEAUTIFUL CONGLOMERATION OF ELLIPSES, PARABOLAS, AND SINE 
760 WAVES IN PERFECT SYMETRY AS SHE SLITHERED INTO THE LIVING ROOM.  I SAT 
761 CONFIDENTLY ON THE SOFA SKETCHING FREE BODY DIAGRAMS.  I FELT THE FIRM PRESSURE
762 OF HER THIGH AGAINST MINE AS SHE SAT DOWN BESIDE ME.  I WOULD JUDGE ITS 
763 MODULUS OF RESILIENCE TO BE ABOUT 0.034 IN-LBS.  I FELT HER WARM BREATH
764 (APPROX. 102.4 DEGREES) ON MY CHEEK AS SHE SAID, "HAVE I KEPT YOU LONG?"
765 "ONLY 34 MINITUTES AND 16.2 SECONDS", I REPLIED, AS I SUBCONCIOUSLY
766 ESTIMATED THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF HER SWEATER TO BE AT LEAST 4000PSI.
767  
768 "ARE ALL ENGINEERS AS STRONG, CALM, AND ROMANTIC AS YOU ARE?"  I WAS MENTALLY 
769 COMPUTING THE ACCELERATION OF MY HEARBEAT TO BE 14.7 THUMPS PER SECOND.
770 "OF COURSE THEY ARE," I SAID, AS I THOUGHT, "ENGINEERS ROMANTIC?"
771 EVEN I HAD LEARNED IN GE711 THAT A WOMAN IS NOTHING BUT A SLOW-
772 MOVING MAN WITH A LOWER SPECIFIC CENTER OF GRAVITY.  SHE MIGHT TEMPT
773 SOME MEN WITH HE4R CURVILINEAR ATTRACTION, BUT NOT ME- AN ENGINEER!
774  
775 I OBSERVED HER COLDLY (114.7 DEGREES F.)/ SHE LEANED OVER ME AND KISSED ME
776 LIGHTLY.  I GLANCED DOWN AT MY LAPEL ONLY TO SEE A MOLTEN MAS THAT HAD ONCE 
777 BEEN MY TAU BETA PIN.  SHE WATCHED IN ADMIRATION AS I CASUALLY PUT THE LIT
778 END OF MY CIGATETTE IN MY MOUTH AND BLEW SMOKE FROM MY TOES.  I ROSE 
779 WITH A MASCULINE AIR OF INDIFFERENCE AND STALKED FROM THE ROOM ON MY 
780 HANDS.

782 Hmmmm...I certainly hope God(The one in the Bible) was not a women.  He 
783 seems to be typicaly regarded as the 'father' of Jesus.  The mother role 
784 reserved for Mary.  If he resembled the female of our spieces things could
785 become unchurchlike.  Of course one may argue that no act of creation was 
786 involved (at least in human perception) and that a female was used as the 
787 natural carrier of the fetus.  Hmm..Is it possible that the origenol
788 consept of this God was both male and female?  I noticed in the0firsd part

824 feel free to call it what you like.

900 The problem with those censored stories is that they are not
901 censored stories at all. Everyone of them has one or more
902 references. Just because the big networks and large
903 circulation papers don't pick up on some story about genetic
904 capitulation doesn't equate cunsorship. Where is your head,
905 man?
906  
907 On top of that, the stories show an incredible slant towards
908 everyone's favorite harbinger of doom and despair - THE LEFT.
909  
910 And does the poster of these canned stories respond to
91!0criticism? If they take the plunge and introduce the less-

913 should also take the responsibility of responding to our
