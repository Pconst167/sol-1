43 Fellow Net Operatives: Coding devices not available at this time. What is
44 the problem with BW? Have the last day's messages  been lost? Land line
45 communications are necessary to circumvent BW errors. Twits are on the
46 rise, and serious action must be taken. NET 4, I have more detailed
47 information for you. NET 2, communication needed ASAP. Next message will
48 be in code burst. NET 3, is your friend at the telephone company still
49 willing to help out with our problems?

91 DEAR ANN LANDERS: I AM WRITING TO SEE IF YOU CAN OFFER ME THE SLIGHTEST GLIMMER 
92 OF HOPE INTO MY WRETCHED LIFE.IT ALL STARTED A YEAR AGO HEN MY 
93 SAWMILL BURNED OWN. MY PARTNER HAD THE FIRE INSURANCE RENEWRD IN HIS NAME, THEN 
94 TORCHED THE PLACE. SO HE COLLECTED, AND IS SOMEWHERE LYING ON A BEACH ATCHING TH
95 E NATIVE GIRLS AND SIPPING SOMETHING EXOTIC FROM A HOLLOWED OUT PINEAPPLE; AND I
96 AM HERE IN HIS PLACE, WHICH REMINDS ME, I'M SORRY FOR WRITING THIS IN CRAYON, 
97 BUT THEY DON'T ALLOW US TO HAVE ANYTHING SHARP HERE. WELL, THAT WASN'T SO BAD, 
98 BUT I HAD JUST COME FROM THE DOCTOR AND LEARNED THAT I HAVE CANCER OF THE BRAIN,
99 LUNGS,COLON, AND ACHILLES TENDON, AND WAS GIVEN ABOUT A YEAR TO LIVE. AND IF 
100 THAT WASN'T BAD ENOUGH, O THE WAY HOME I WAS INVOLVED IN A THREE CAR ACCIDENT, 
101 AND AS THE OTHER TWO CARS WERE POLICE CARS, I HAD TO PUT UP MY HOUSE FOR BAIL. 
102 WHEN I FINALLY DID GET HOME, I FOUND OUT THAT MY WIFE HAD RUN OFF WITH A 
103 BULGARIAN DENTIST FROM SOUTH EL MONTE, AND HER MOTHER HAD MOVED IN, AND SHE 
104 IMMEDIATELY STARTED BADMOUTHING ME. I JUST COULDN'T TAKE ANYMORE, AND DECIDED TO
105 END IT ALL. I TOOK MY PISTOL AND POINTED IT AT MY HEAD, AND,---PULLED THE TRIGGE
106 BUT, SIGH, I MISSED, AND HIT-YOU GUESSED IT- MY MOTHER IN LAW. THE POLICE SAID I
107 DID IT ELIBERATELY, BUT THANK GOD THE JURY BELIEVED ME, AND SET ME FREE. I WAS 
108 SO HAPPY, THINKING I COULD LIVE OUT THE REST OF MY SHORT LIFE IN PEACE, BUT WHEN
109 I GOT HOME, THERE WERE MORE POLICE WAITING FOR ME. I WAS ARRESTED FOR ATEMPTING 
110 SUICIDE. THE JUDGE SAID I WAS A MENACE TO SOCIETY, AND SENT ME HERE, TO THE 
111 SNICKERING SYCAMORES REST HOME, WHERE THIS BATTLE AXE NURSE MAKES ME WEAVE 
112 BASKETS ALL DAY.YESTERDAY I GOT A LETTER FROM MY KIDS, AND THEY SAID HEY ALL 
113 HATE ME, AND TOMORRROW THE DOCTOR IS GOING TO DO A LOBOTOMY ON ME. WELL, THATS 
114 MY STORY, CAN YOU OFER ME ANY HOPE?
115 *=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*DREAMTOUCHER*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*
116 AHA! VEREY GOOD KIND INNKEEPER BUT WILL IT WORK FOR LONG.  WE MAY HOPE.
117   MUST HAVE DOZED OFF AGAIN. WERE DID EVERYBODY GO.
118   NOTICING THEY WERE NEARLY ALONE AT THEIR TABLE, THEMNAX AND DREAMTOUCHER 
119 WENT TO THE FRONT DOOR AND PEEKED OUT.  A LARGE BUS-LIKE OBJECT WAS JUST PULLING
120 AWAY FROM THE VERANDA.  THE DESTINATION SIGN SAID: CHARTERED AND A HAND LETTERED
121 PAPPER SIGN IN THE LOWER RIGHT FRONT WINDSHIELD SAID: TWIT'S MYSTERY TOUR.
122   "CANT SAY AS I'M SAD TO SEE THAT LOT DEPART";DREAMTOUCHER SAID. 
123   "WHO WERE THEY?";THEMNAX ASKED.
124   "IT'S A LONG STORY.  ASK THE BARD OR THE SHADOW CREW SOME TIME IF WE EVER
125 SEE THEM AGAIN."
126   "SPEAKING OF THE BARD; WASN'T HE THE ONE WITH A LEAD ON THIS MCKANE BUNCH?"
127   "THAT'S RIGHT BUT WERE IS HE.  HE COULD BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US FOR ALL I CAN
128 TELL BUT ONE THING'S ODD"
129   "WHAT'S THAT?"
130   "I DON'T SEE SHADOW!"
131   "SHADOW?"
132   "L'HOMME'S CAR.  NOW THAT IS ODD"
133   "WE MIGHT AS WELL HEAD UP TO MY ROOM FOR A BIT.  THERE IS SOMETHING ODD
134 THERE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO ME."; THEMNAX INVITED.
135   WHEN THEY GOT THERE HE SHOWED DREAMTOUCHER A DOOR SET INTO THE WALL WITH NO
136 OBVIOUS WAY OF OPPENING.  "I'VE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF CUTTING THE LATCH.  DON'T 
137 TELL THE INNKEEPER ABOUT THAT THOUGH, I USED THE CUT-METTAL FUNCTION OF MY STAFF
138 AND I'M NOT SURE HOW HE WOULD FEEL ABOUT IT."
139   THEMNAX OPPENED THE DOOR IN QUESTION.  BEHIND IT WAS SIMPLY AN ALMOST DOOR
140 SIZED MIRROR FLUSH WITH THE REST OF THE ROOM'S WALL.  TO
141 ONE SIDE OF ITS WIDE METTALIC FRAIM WAS A SMALL 3 BY 5 KEYPAD.  THEMNAX TYPED IN
142 90909.  THE MIRROR VANISHED AND THEY WERE LOOKING INTO A DINING ROOM.  SEVERAL
143 FAMILIAR FACES WERE SEATED AT TABLE, AMONG THEM VOYEUR AND L'HOMME!
144   "GO BACK AND LOOK AROUND THE INN AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND THE BARD.  IF NOT 
145 COME BACK UP HERE AND PUNCH THE SAME CODE I JUST DID."
146   THEMNAX THEN SAT, LOTUSLIKE ON HIS MINI-GRAV-SLED, EASED OFF THE FLOOR ABOUT 
147 SIX INCHES AND TURNED ONCE AGAIN TO DREAMTOUCHER.  "OK.  NOW REMEMBER WHAT I
148 SAID."
149   DREAMTOUCHER REPEATED IT BACK.  THEMNAX WAS SATISFIED THAT HE GOT IT RIGHT. 
150 PUTTING ON HIS CLOAK, HE SEEMED TO DISSAPPEAR IN FRONT OF DREAMTOUCHER'S EYES.  
151 HIS DISEMBODIED VOICE SEEMED TO COME FROM MID AIR.  "AS SOON AS I'M COMPLETELY
152 THROUGH, PUSH THE KEY LABLED '#'".  
153   WITH THAT THE SEEMINGLY EMPTY GRAV SLED GLIDED TWARD AND THROUGH THE OPPENING.
154   AS SOON AS IT CLEARED, DREAMTOUCHER DID AS THEMNAX HAD ASKED OF HIM AND THE
155 DOORWAY ONCE ACAIN BECAME A MIR
156   BEFORE HE LEFT THE ROOM, DREAMTOUCHER CLOSED THE CRUDE WOOD AND IRON DOOR WHIC
157 CONCIELED THE 'MIRROR'.  HE THEN LEFT THEMNAX'S ROOM AND WENT DOUNSTAIRS TO TRY 
158 THE BATH.

260 a bunch of fresh flowers in a small vase on a table near the head of the

310      Well, if all the juvies are one person, maybe he'll settle down after
311 just a brief stay.  I wish he would try another boarder for tom,  I did
312 have it first.  Did you say that the saturday meeting was cancelled on
313 the 30th?  THE DAY I WAS FINALLY GOING TO MAKE IT?!?!?!?!?  Whoever said
314 life wasn't fair was correct.  Oh well, I may show up at westercon just
315 for the heck of it, I have a few friends who are going to be there.  Speakin
316 g of whom, I'm supposed to meet someone soon so I must depart.

327    AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS, AS HE TURNED TOWARD THE CORRIDOR LEADING TO
328 THE BATH, DREAMTOUCHER HAPPENED TO GLANCE IN AT THE COMON ROOM.  "WHAT IS 
329 THIS?!?!" HE ASKED HIMSELF.  NEARLY EVERYONE WAS STILL SEATED AT THE TABLE.
330   EVERYONE EXCEPT THEMNAX THAT IS!  QUICKLY HE TURNED BACK TWARD THEMNAX'S
331 ROOM.  WHEN HE GOT THERE HE PUNCHED IN THE CODE BESIDE THE MIRROR
332 JUST AS THEMNAX HAD INSTRUCTED EARLIER.  THE ROOM BEYOND, WHEN THE MIRROR
333 CLEARED, WAS EMPTY AND A BIT DUSTY.  THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN THERE!
334   HE POKED HIS HEAD THROUGH AND TRIED SENDING.  THERE WAS NO RESPONSE!
335   HE EVEN STUCK HIS WALKING STICK THROUGH AS FAR AS IT WOULD REACH BUT
336 STILL NO LUCK.  CONSIDERING WHAT HE THOUGHT HE HAD SEEN AND WHAT HE SEEMED
337 TO BE SEEING NOW, HE DECEIDED UPON DESCREATION AS BEING THE BETTER PART ET.C
338  AND RECLOSED THE PORTAL AND MADE HIS WAY THOUGHTFULLY BACK DOWNSTAIRS.
339   "MAYBE THAT GOOD WARM SOAK WILL HELP UNSCRAMBLE MY THOUGHTS AFTER ALL."
340   SHEDDING HIS SIMPLE GARMENTS AS HE WENT, HE FOLDED THEM NEATLY BESIDE
341 THE POOL (BATH) AND EASED HIMSELF IN.

344   AS SOON AS HE GLIDED THROUGH HE REALIZED SOMETHING WAS NOT RIGHT.
345   HE COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT THE FIGGURES AT THE TABLE WERE ONLY HOLOGRAMS.  
346 HE ALSO NOTICED THAT THE DECOR WAS AMERICAN ERSATZ ITALIAN RESTURANT
347 LATE 20TH CENTURY EARTH!  WHEN HE TURNED TO GO BACK THERE WAS NO PORTAL
348 TO RETURN THROUGH.  AS HE SAT IN CONSTERNATION, ONE FIGGURE WHICH WAS 
349 NIETHER PROJECTED NOR ANDROID APPROACHED.  HE HAD A LONG GREY BEARD AND 
350 TATTERED METALIC GREYISH ROBES.  
351   "ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF"; THE FIGURE SAID.  "MY NAME IS 
352 SLARTIBARTFARST AND YOU ARE ON MY SHIP THE BISTROMATH, PERMINENTLY DESGUISED
353 AS AN ITAILIAN RESTAURANT.  SEE THAT SALT SHAKER OVER THERE?  IT IS TWO RED 
354 CHECKER SQUARES DIAGONALY FROM WERE I SET IT.  IT WONT RESET.  WERE ABOUT TO
355 LAND SOMEPLACE TOTALY STRAINGE TO ME.  AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW, I AM A
356 PLANET SCULPTUR AND I LOVE TO DO THE FIDDLEY BITS AROUND FJORDS."
357   "UTTERLY FASSINATED"; THEMNAX REPLIED.  "I AM A COORDINATOR OF THE HUB AND
358 SERVENT OF ALL EXIXTANCE.  I WAS SENT OUT TWARD THE INNISFELL SECTOR WERE 
359 THROUGH MISFORTUNE MY OWN SHIP WAS DESTROID.  I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE
360 PERPETRATORS OF A LARGE SCALE CULTURAL INTERFIERANCE FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION
361 KNOWN VARIOSLY AS THE MCKANE GROUP.  MOST
362 PERSONS I'VE TALKED TO SO FAR BELIEVE IT TO BE OF EARTH ORIGON BUT MY OWN
363 SUSPECIONS ARE THAT IT IS A FRONT OF THAT WORLD WHICH WANTS TO USE EARTH'S 
364 PEOPLE AS IT'S ARMY OF CONQUEST AGAINST THE PEACE AND FREEDOM LOVING
365 PEOPLE OF THE MORE CIVILIZED WORLDS OF THE MILKY WAY GALIXY."
366 
367   "YOU DON'T MEEN..."
368   "YES; THE SLEMNAKS OF ORGAMO, KNOWN TO EARTH'S CHARTS AS 61-SIGNI-4!"
369   WITH A GRINDING JOLT, ALL SENSE OF MOTION CEASED.  NOT THAT THERE 
370 WAS MUCE TO BEGIN WITH.  LOOKING OUT THEY COULD SEE THEY HAD LANDED NEXT TO 
371 A PYRAMID SHAPED BOOK STOR AND BEYOND THAT A MIDEAVUL INN!  A LARGE GREY
372 BUSS WHICH HAD JUST PULLED AWAY FROM THE INN JUST AS QUICKLY STOPED INFRONT 
373 OF INNISFELL'S NEW ITALIAN RESTURANT; THE BISTROMATH!
374   "OH NO"; SLARTI CALLED OUT IN EXASPERATION,"WERE SURLY DOOMED NOW, A WHOLE
375 BUSLOAD OF TWITS ARE DECENDING UPON US".
376   WITH LOUD WHOOPS OF "BUD" AND "OLY" AND "NO ANCHOVIES" THEY BURST THROUGH 
377 THE AIRLOCK/FRONT DOOR.  QUICKLY PROGRAMING THE ANDROIDS TO PREVENT THE TWIT
378 S FROM PLAYING WITH THE SALT-SHAKERS AT ALL COST, SLARTI AND THEMNAX FLED 
379 OUT THE BACK WAY AND RAN FOR THAIR LIVES; STREIGHT INTO THE INN!

434 your proposed RISK game this Saturday.  From what I've seen, it looks like 
435 we have myself, L'homme, and MiG, with WHISPER declining.

439       Sorry all for those controls, it was fine until only half of the 
440  characters were taken out. I'll try to keep them from my others, well
441  some of my messages that is.  
442       Where did Lord Morby run of to anyway? he used to use this system
443  quite a lot when he was here. Was he a good character in you'r game?
444       That risk game sounds like a blast, have fun. Maybe we could start up
445  a game on this system, no, take to long. Ohh, well.
446       Tom Tom, we could have a good chess game over a period of time in here,
447  what do you say? OK, so maybe you don't play chess, sorry.

453 Does this blow the bonus-if-done-by-Monday?  Heaven forbid.
454 Luck!
455 -> Milchar - don't see much from you here lately.  Too busy DMing the game on PCS?

464 FIN SHOOK HIS HEAD, TRYING TO CLEAR THE COBWEBS FROM BETWEEN HIS EYES. HE
465 LOOKED AROUND FOR SOME FAMILIAR SIGN OF HIS WHEREABOUTS BUT FOUND ONLY GREEN
466 GRASS AS FAR AS THE EYES COULD SEE. THEN IN THE DISTANCE A SILVERY SHIM-
467 MER CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION. IT SEEMED TO BE DRAWING CLOSER AT A RATHER RAPID
468 
RATE OF SPEED AND HE COULD DETECT NO SOUND FROM WHATEVER IT WAS USING FOR
469 A POWER PLANT. THEN "IT" WAS UPON HIM, OR RAHTER ABOVE HIM, WHISPERING
470 TO ITSELF. THE CRAFT, FOR THAT WAS WHAT IT APPEARED TO BE, MEASURED AT
471 ROUGHLY THREE FOOTBALL FIELDS. HE COULDN'T SEE ANY LIGHTS OR OTHER VISIBLE
472 SIGNS OF LIFE FROM WHAT WERE APPARENTLY WINDOWS, BUT DIDN'T LET THIS LULL
473 HIM INTO A STATE OF DISREGARD. IT WAS BIG, QUIET AND QUITE OBVIOUSLY VERY
474 HEAVY. AND HE WAS IN THE CENTER OF IT'S SHADOW. 
475 "WELL, HE THOUGHT, THIS IS DEFINITELY THE LAST TIME I LISTEN TO GARTHLEM
476 WHEN IT COMES TO DRINKING SULTERMIN!" HE ATTEMPTED TO WALK AWAY FROM WHAT
477 WAS QUITE CERTAIN TO BE HIS DEMISE IF HE DIDN'T MOVE AND THE SHIP SHOULD
478 SUDDENLY DROP IN. THE FURTHER HE MOVED, THE FURTHER THE SHIP MOVED. AND
479 CHANGING DIRCTIONS DIDN'T HELP HIM ANY EITHER. FIN SAID HIS PRAYERS AND
480 STARTED SPRINTING AS FAST HIS LONG LEGS WOULD ALLOW. AND THEN THE WORLD WENT
481 WENT DARK.C

490 I have the same problem with cbbs/nw.  anyone know anything about it?  I would
491 like to be a watcher at the risk game (I know of the hazards of playing)  if
492 it would be alright.  But for now...

494 I was going through my pockets looking for a coin to pay my tab with when I
495 ran across a bit of paper.  I know that wasn't here before.  Opening it up
496 I quickly read it's contents.  "This dosn't look good," looking up at the
497 inkeeper I said, "I'll be gone for a while, but with any luck I'll be back
498 in a couple of weeks."   Going through the door I wispered "with a couple
499 of friends as well..."
500      Going through the dusk air, I found a clearing near a large tree with
501 low branches.  Producing three minibolos, I set two on the ground, and one
502 upon the lowest branch.  I fiddled with the controlls, until I was able to
503 produce the proper resonance field between the three.  Using the field
504 as a door, I stepped through..........
