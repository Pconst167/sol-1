20 [*=*] - No problem as to size/case/word length. I was only bringing up a
21 point that might give your entry greater appeal. You must make your own
22 decisions though as to what you like and want. I can only tell you what
23 I like. I perfer 76 characters per line, but I am not fussy about it.
24 as for breaking words, break them where it looks ok. But I have enjoyed
25 your entries to date either way.
26 L'Homme - Most certainly there were times of emotional outbursts, and they 
27 were also commented on as not being in keeping with proper debate structures.
28 Good writing is like bits of wheat amongst the chaff, you have to dig 
29 through the chaff to find the wheat. It seldom occurs in big splotches.

63 You know how they talk about apple-cheeked midwestern girls    
64 who out of restlessnwss or cussedness leave their sweet country
65 towns and fond families, take a bus to the Big Slimy City and
66 devote their tender earnest souls to heartless gangsters and
67 pimps? well.  Some girls go the other way.  Girls like me from
68 Big Slimy Cities where parents believe in permissive child-
69 rearing and early access to birth-control.  Girls like me who
70 know too much too soon about easy money and easy virtue take
71 the Amtrak to Oklahoma City to Discover America: the America
72 of hard work, chastity, and moral order.  Girls like me are
73 fodder for the McKane Financial and Spiritual Organization.
74 We answer an ad (decent humble females wanted...) and are drug
75 ged and indoctrinated as "counselors" for the scam run by Hon-
76 ored Matri, McKane's trusted assistant.  It's easy.  We ad-
77 vertise on Paul Harvey.  The rubes come in with their budget-
78 ary problems and after a little sodium pentathol and some pa-
79 laver about the ecstacy of spiritual elevation, they gleeful-
80 ly sign it all over to McKane's current clayfoot guru.  You
81 don't even usually have to drug them.  Midwesterners may be
82 wholesome but they are definitely not quick. This work is 
83 not the spine-stiffening stuff of our fore-fathers and I would
84 gladly go back to the Slimy City where you can at least get
85 a decent cup of cappachino but I know too much to be let go.
86 So far I've seen 2 possible chinks in this outfit:
87 1.  Hon. M. went to check out a possible defector and came
88    back all dazed and flushed mumbling about "physical and
89     spiritual assets." A few days ago she got the same look
90     and yelled, "We've got to save the Rickshaw Driver.!"
91    and started beating on Rocky.
92 2.  Rocky is not as docile as McKane's cult heroes. Rocky
93 looks like Robert Mitchum, the only human emotion he ever reg-
94 isters is scorn, and he swears in Alabanian whenever he gets
95 letters from home. "i don't understand these big-deal bombs,"
96 "Just send a couple of gats,Wassir"  Rocky's all man.

98 Oh yeah, I was named during my Mom's trendy Bolshevik phase

103 LYSIAS SAT AT HIS USUAL TABLE AT THE BACK OF THE INN, INGESTING ANOTHER PIZZA. HE HAD HOPED TO ORDER HALF ANCHOVIES/HALF CANADI
104 N BACON, BUT SINCE HE HADN'T HEARD FROM SLARTI OR DREAMTOUCHER FOR SO LONG, HE DECIDED THEY WEREN'T COMING. LYSIAS HAD HAD A LO
105 OF TIME TO THINK, AND HE WAS STARTING TO REALIZE HE WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE (APPARENTLY) MOST INOPPORTUNE TIME. NOT ONE T
106 BEGRUDGE HIS MISGUIDED EFFORTS, OR THE LACK OF INTEREST SHOWN BY THOSE HE OFFERED TO HELP, HE SIMPLY DECIDED TO WITHDRAW FROM T
107 E SITUATION. " I'LL TAKE THAT VACATION I'VE BEEN PROMISING MY SELF FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND VARPTRS, HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF". BUT-JU
108 T FOR THE HELLUVIT, HE MADE HIMSELF A PROMISE. I'LL POP IN ONE OF THESE DAYS, AND USE MY TIME WARP KEY, AND TAKE SOME OF THESE 
109 HARACTERS BACK IN TIME, AND SHOW THEM HOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN IF THEY WOULD HAVE ONLY ALLOWED ME TO HELP. OH WELL, SIGH, I 
110 GUESS I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. LYSIAS MOUTHED THE TIME WARP KEY, (BETWEEN MUNCHES) AND RELIVED WHAT HAD NOT YET HAPPENED AT THE INN
111 MCKANE DEAD OF A COLON INFECTION. MCKANE INDUSTRIES FALLING APART WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP OF "LEROY". THE FBI, THE CIA, THE NATI
112 NAL SECURITY COUNCIL, THE TRI-LATERAL COMMISSION, THE HARPER VALLEY PTA ALL CLAIMING CREDIT FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF MCKANE INDUS
113 RIES. CONGRESSIONAL SUB-COMMITEES SPENDING MILLIONS IN TAXPAYERS DOLLARS TO FIGURE IT OUT. 
114 LYSIAS THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THIS, AND FOR ONCE, WISHED HE DIDN'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE TIME WARP. 
115 BUT, AS HE DID, HE MOUTHER THE KEY, AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE SHORE OF A SMALL ISOLATED LAKE SOMEWHERE ON A SMALL PLANET IN THE 
116 LEIADES CONSTELLATION, IN SIDEREAL TAURUS. LYSIAS DECIDED TO STAY THERE UNTILL - WHENEVER."I GUESS I WON'T BE GOING BACK TO THE

119 I found this in a textbook on Business Communications.
120 It reminded me of the discussion about how great Pam and d's writing is.
121 A tale often told in direct-mail circles concerns two sales letter writers.
122 One was a budding neophyte; the other was a wise old-timer. One day after
123 long hours of hard work, the old-timer handed his first draft of a sales letter
124 to the neophyte.  "Read it," he said, "and tell me what you think."
125 The neophyte read.  He was wonderfully impressed.  "It is beautiful writing--
126 simply beautiful," he responded.  "Without question, it is the most beautiful
127 sales writing I have ever read!"
128 After hearing these words, the old-timer took the letter, crumpled it, and
129 tossed it into a wastebasket.  Then without uttering a word, he returned to
130 his typewriter and began work on a new letter.
131 The neophyte was dumbfounded.  After some moments of bewilderment he asked,
132 "Why did you do that?  Why did you destroy that most beautiful writing?"
133 The old-timer replied, "Beautiful was not the right answer.  What I wanted
134 to hear was `That's a good product.'"
135 
136 Think about it.

139    The morning sun streamed in through the half-open door of the inn
140 as the piper came down the stairs to the common room.  No one else was
141 stirring, the slanting rays cut golden swaths through the smoke
142 that still filled the air from last night's fire.  He walked to the
143 door and stood in the opening for a moment, looking at the fresh morning,
144 waiting for the stiffness of sleep to fade.  Streching, the piper walked
145 back inside and into the bathroom of the inn.  Stripping of his tunic
146 and kilt, he slid into the huge pool heated by natural springs that
147 nearly filled an adjoining room.  Laying back with the water up to his 
148 chin, he mused about the recent goings-on.
149 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
150    Mikey -- I agree with you about keeping the Inn sancrosact.  I enjoy
151 disporting with the patrons as time goes by.  Unfortunately, with the
152 Frank matter, I cannot engage in a debate -- I consider his activities
153 a threat to my family's well being.  Obviousy, the problem is not as
154 severe as someone breaking into the house wielding a gun, but I
155 cannot consider it any the less a crime of violence.  Perhaps I
156 reacted too much to the threat -- I do think that I mentioned that
157 I wanted to think things through -- but Frank and others in his 
158 situation should remember that my priorities set my family before
159 my own well-being.  I feel that violence to children from adults
160 is normally indefensable.  (No kids, I don't want to spank you
161 but if, under certain circumstances I must, it is MY failure
162 you are being punished for, and yes -- I have failed.)  I cannot
163 accept that turning a child into an emotional cripple is any less
164 serious than turning one into a physical cripple.  Now we come to
165 the heart of the matter -- does an adult forcing a sexual encounter
166 on a child emotionally cripple the child?  My intuition tells me
167 yes so strongly that I will react as emotionally as I have.  In fact,
168 I would treat any evidence given by an admitted child molester such
169 as Frank with great caution.  It is obvious that he wishes social
170 approval (or at least no criminal penalties) for his particular
171 actions.  I, for one have registered my strong disapproval (and
172 perhaps some overreaction).  O.K., Frank -- I will at least look at
173 some evidence that what you do doesn't hurt anyone.  I will probably
174 not be convinced, but will check out any references you care to
175 name.  Also relevant is the age of your victims.  I would react less
176 strongly as they are older -- at 18 they have been on their own
177 for some time.
178 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
179 To all:
180     The piobareachd competition was delightful.  Most of the pipers
181 did quite well, unfortunately my favorites did not win except for
182 a young lady from B.C. Canada, who took the second place.  (she 
183 did well last year too).
184   Today are the athletic, dancing, lesser piping, and band events.
185 drop by David Douglas High at any time today (before 4:00) and 
186 check out the action.
187 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

189 **********************************************************
190 Piper : I agree with you on the Frank thing. I don't think I could 
191 effectively debate the issue myself, though not having children
192 myself it is not a subject as close to home as it is with you.
193 But I certainly agree with you in spirit. I was only pointing out
194 to L'homme that the discussion taking place was not a debate,
195 but simply a plain ordinary argument involving two opposing views.
196 You don't engage in name calling and threats in a proper debate.

201                            Discussion
202   Here is a question that we (everyone) could discuss if they wanted to.
203   For the sake of the argument I will take the side of "Pro" instead of "Con".
204 
205  "Is limited nuclear war possible?" There it is.  I think that if both
206 sides were to agree to only hit missile silo's it could be a possibility.
207 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
208 LIMITED NUCLEAR WAR? NO. NO WAY. CONSIDER THE ELECTRO MAGNETIC PULSE AS ONE REAS
209 ON. WHEN A NUCLEAR DEVICE IS DETONATED THE EXPLOSION 'KNOCKS' COUNTLESS TRILIONS
210 OF ELECTRONS OUT OF THE ATOMS THAT MAKE UP THE ATMOSPHERE. THESE ELECTRONS 'COND
211 ENSE' ON ANY METALLIC OBJECT. AFTER AN H BOMB TEST IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC TELEPHON
212 E EQIUPMWNT, POWER DISTRIBUTION STATIONS, RADAR, ETC ETC WERE RENDERED INOPERABL
213 E HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. AND THIS FROM ONE "DEVICE" DETONATED AT LOW ALTITUDE. 
214 DELICATE SOLID STATE EQUIPMENT IS ESPECIALLY SUCEPTIBLE TO THIS EMP. ONE MEDIUM 
215 SIZE BOMB DETONATED AT HIGH ALTITUDE (100 MILES, EG) WOULD DEVESTATE COMMUNICATI
216 ONSZ, RADAR, ETC, OVER MOST OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. WHOEVER STRIKES FIRST WIL
217 L "WIN". NOTE QUOTE MARKS ON WIN. BOTH SIDES KNOW THIS, OF COURSE, SO TO USE ANY
218 THING LESS THAN EVERYTHING WOULD BE A VERY BAD MOVE FOR EITHER SIDE. IT WILL MOS
219 T LIKELY BE ALL OR NOTHING. THE INN WOULD BE DESTROYED BY 'HI-TECH'.(AS WELL AS
220 THE REST OF THE WORLD). I PROPOSE A QUESTION MORE BEFITTING THE SPIRIT OF THE IN
221 N. "HOW WOULD YOU RATE THE QUALITY OF THE INKEEPERS ALE?"
222 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
223 Yes, that question is High tech and should be dropped!
224 By the way, how good is the quality of the ale?
225 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
226 Lysias: Please do NOT use lines longer than 126 chars. 128 char lines mess up 
227 the FA & FI functions!
228 To: The person above. That test was practically in ORBIT! It was NOT a low 
229 altitude test. Otherwise your entry was ok.

242 PLEASE DO. IT IS WIERD WHEN YOU CALL AND ITS BUSY, THEN WHEN

276 OK, I know I was a bit (well very) emotional in my responce (actually I
277 just ranted) to the Frank episode.  Well, that's because I get very emotion
278 -al with such a subject.  this is neither an apology or explanation for
279 my behavior.  It's just a statement.  And should we have a similar topic 
280 in the future, I'm sorry to say that I may most probably end up ranting again.

284   I watched the Piper leave after anouncing his intention to 
285 go to some sort of competition.  Now I wonder what this 'kaber' 
286 thing was that he was muttering about as he left. 
287      That and the dour mood of the Innkeeper leaves me a bit 
288 puzzled.  After his chasing out the odd looking individuals 
289 that were brandishing some strange implements, I found myself 
290 alone in the Inn.  After the intense and loud background noise 
291 of people talking laughing and occasional shout, the ensuing 
292 silence left my ears ringing.  Inquiring of the Innkeeper what 
293 it was all about left me with no answer, so I just shrug my 
294 shoulders, settle back in my chair and wait for the madness to 
295 return.  Actually, it is rather nice to be able to hear myself 
296 think for a change after all the hubbub.  
297      I wonder who this 'd' was that one of the louder arguments 
298 had been going on about.  And what of this PAM person who 
299 seemed to somehow be associated.  Perhaps if I stick around 
300 I'll findout the answers to these questions and many others I 
301 have about this strange place.

304    As the wind rushed by and the slanting raysof spring sun
305 glistened on the morning dew, Griff couldn't help but to daydream
306 about what lay ahead.  He knew it would be the most spectacular
307 thing that he would ever see.  But then his mind shifted to thinking
308 of all the warnings that he had left behind.  They were posted at 
309 the town meeting hall, warnings of danger and death.  Griff paid
310 no attention to those peices of paper at all, he was going to enter
311 the forest of Andeluvia and find the magic of his ancestors.
312    The first day passed, and the second, and the third.  Griff pushed
313 on accros the seemingly andless expans.  On the fourth day the gentle 
314 forest gave way to sharp inclines and deep gulleys with scattered 
315 clearings dotting the landscape.  He had been traveling with only
316 the briefest of stops for food and rest, and the intense pace of the
317 journey began to take its toll.  Fatigue and hunger ate at his
318 physique.  Only his burning hope gave him the strength to follow the
319 terrain.  Griff pushed further into the deepening woods.  He couldn't
320 stop thinking of the wonder that lay ahead.

330 To all: Well, since my limited calling ability just shot my chance to get into the McKane story (I think I missed one

332 at least until the end of the summer...
333 To any who care : My job is going fairly well.  Any of you out there who have programmed on Apples can appreciate the
334 hell I'm going through to write database programs for it.  But it pays....
335 NET 01: I am still waiting for a Phone transmission from you about NET membership.  I have ceased working on the Level
336 two code as my job requires nearly all of my time.
337 Aaron: What happened?  I thought that we were going to play CE today (21st).  couldn't you find enough players?  
338 Nuclear Debate: I think that either side would rather unleash all of their weapons rather than deal with the 'Deadlands'
339 left over after a "limited" exchange.  If a war develops between the Soviet Union and the U.S., I believe it will be
340 on the "Flexible Response" plan.  That is, each side will only use weapons that are on a par with the other's.
341 If that means small bombs (non-nuclear), then so be it.  If it means nuclear ones.....

345    There sits a ghost at the Inn.  He lurks in the corner, moaning quiet
346 moans.  A shadow of a man who laughs no more.  He thinks of a land lost,
347 wallows in his misery and cries waterless tears.  Yet no one cares, no one
348 wishes to hear his his story.  For there are many ghosts at the Inn, all

406 Concerning "Limited Nuclear War"
407   This entry is based on  an article entitled '"No First Use" of Nuclear
408 Weapons,' written by Kurt Gottfried, Henry W Kendall, and John M Lee--as found
409 in the March, 1984 issue of Scientific American.(pp 33-41):
410   NATO currently subscribes to a first-use policy as a means to deter enemy 
411 agression.  "...under the present first-use policy nuclear weapons are integral
412 to the training, planning and equipping phases of all NATO military operations.
413 In the event of reverses in a major conflict there would be almost irresistable
414 pressure to use them."  This is most unfortunate because "...even the most
415 limited use of nuclear weapons could well lead to the ultimate catastrophe of
416 global nuclear war."
417   Unfortunately, no method has been proposed for stopping a nuclear war once it
418 has been started.  An organization called the Union of Concerned Scientists (of
419 which the article's authors are members) conducted a thorough investigation of
420 current political and military situations.  Their report calls for an increase
421 of conventional weapons and the adoption of a "no first-use" policy.
422   The use of nuclear weapons on a limited scale requires accurate, prompt infor-
423 mation on army locations and troop movements.  The military demands for engaging in
424 nuclear war calls for immediate information and decisions from those in
425 authority.  NATO relies on an intricate system to gather information and make
426 decisions (the system is referred to as 'command, control, communications and 
427 intelligence', or C3I).  If communications lines were attacked (as they certainly
428 would be) field commanders would be helpless as they cannot act alone.
429 Instead, the highest authorities of all NATO countries must agree on the timing,
430 magnitude, and location of ANY nuclear attack.  This leads to mass confusion.
431 The political requirements for the use of nuclear weapons openly conflict the
432 military's ability to act effectively.  Field commanders are stuck with troops
433 equipped with and trained in warfare with nuclear weapons (thus creating a
434 strong desire to use them) While communications are delayed by indecision, red
435 tape, and are possibly even destroyed.  This all leads to the destruction of
436 NATO forces while our missiles lie dormant and/or (even worse) the unauthorized
437 use of nuclear weapons followed by chaotic nuclear escalation.  "It would be
438 reckless to assume that escalation far beyond the battlefield could be averted
439 in such circumstances."
440   In order to stop escalation to global nuclear war, superb diplomacy in an
441 extreme crisis would be needed.  Such rapid agreements (specific limits on
442 targets and weapon use) would require unprecedented bilateral cooperation such
443 as the Earth has never seen.
444   Taken again from '"No First Use" of Nuclear Weaponry':
445 "In short, there is no plausible scenario for the use of nuclear weapons in a
446 conflict between the two superpowers that does not carry with it the danger of
447 catastrophic escalation."

457    IT WAS ALMOST DUSK WHEN I FINALLY REACHED THE LAKE, AND 
458 THOUGH I WAS TIRED FROM THE LONG WALK, I FELT STRANGELY REFRESH
459 ED. PERHAPS, I THOUGHT, IT IS BECAUSE I AM SO CLOSE TO THE END
460 
461 OF MY JOURNEY. SITTING MYSELF DOWN ON A LARGE STONE AT THE EDGE
462 OF THE WATER, I TOOK OFF MY SANDALS AND IMMERSED MY TIRED FEET
463 IN THE COOL CRYSTAL CLEAR WATER. A DRAGONFLY BUZZED ABOUT ME,AN
464 D FOR A SECOND, IT'S TWIN PAIRS OF WINGS WERE TRANSFORMED INTO
465 TINY STAINED GLASS WINDOWS BY THE SETTING SUN, AND THEN IT WAS
466 
467 GONE. THE WAVES LAPPED RHYTHMICALLY AT MY FEET,THE CAT TAILS 
468 THAT GREW ALONG THE SHORE SWAYED BACK AND FORTH IN THE GENTLE
469 BREEZE, KEEPING TIME. SUDDENLY THE WIND SHIFTED AND THE AIR WAS
470 
471 FILLED WITH DELICATE WHITE SEEDS OF A COTTONWOOD TREE, LIKE TIN
472 Y CLOUDS FLOATING DOWN TO EARTH. MY COMPANION TOOK GREAT DELIGH
473 T IN CHASING THEM ABOUT, AND I LAUGHED ALOUD AS HE SNEEZED, HIS
474 LITTLE PAWS BRUSHING THEM FROM HIS WHISKERS. 
475 AS THE SUN SLIPPED BELOW THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE, I AROSE AND SET
476 UP MY CAMP. PITCHING MY LITTLE TENT, AND BUILDING A SMALL CAMP
477 FIRE. HOW FORTUNATE, THAT I FOUND SOME CEDAR BRANCHES, I LOVE
478 THE AROMA OF A CEDAR FIRE. IN THE LAST MOMENTS OF LIGHT, I 
479 CAUGHT A CATFISH, AND MY COMPANION AND I DINED ON IT, AND
480 THE WILD STRAWBERRIES THAT HE HAD
481 FOUND.
482 CRAWLING INTO MY LITTLE TENT, I LAID BACK, AND ONCE AGAIN, MY
483 THOUGHTS DRIFTED--BACK TO ANOTHER TIME---. MY COMPANION CRAWLED
484 UP ON MY CHEST, AND LOOKED AT ME AS IF TO SAY,"TELLME ABOUT IT"
485 
486 I HAD BEEN ASLEEP, AND WAS ONLY HALF AWAKENED BY THE COMMOTION
487 THE SHOUTS OF THE VILLAGERS. MY SISTER SHOOK ME AWAKE;"COME! 
488 FATHER HAS RETURNED. COME GREET HIM. AAKE NOW, I RAN OUT INTO 
489 THE SQUARE, AND HE GRABBED ME, AND SWUNG ME UP ONTO HIS SHOULDE
490 R. HOW PROUD I WAS AS THE VILLAGERS CROWDED AROUND US, CALLING 
491 OUT GREETINGS, SHAKING HANDS. THEN, SUDDENLY, HE BEGGED TO BE
492 EXCUSED, AND STRODE AWAY. OFF WE WALKED, AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE,
493 AND INTO THE WOODS. SOON, WE CAME TO A SMALL CLEARING, AND MY 
494 FATHER SAT ME DOWN ON A LOG. THEN HE SPOKE."MY CHILD, YOU HAVE 
495 HEARD IT WHISPERED THAT ONE DAY I WOULD RETURN, AND BRING A 
496 GREAT GIFT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE VILLAGE. THIS IS NOT TO BE. 
497 INSTEAD, IT WILL BE UPON YOU TO COMPLETE THIS NOBLE TASK. 
498 REACHING INTO HIS POCKET, HE WITHDREW A SMALL TIN BOX, WHICH HE
499 HANDED TO ME. THEN HE DREW HIS GREAT BROADSWORD, AND PLUNGED IT
500 
501 DEEP UNDER A LARGE ROCK. BEADS OF SWEAT TRICKLED FROM HIS BROW 
502 ,AND HIS MIGHTY ARMS BULGED IN HIS EFFORT. SLOWLY, THE HUGE ROC
503 
504 K WAS RAISED. "PLACE THE BOX UNDER THE ROCK, HE ORDERED ME. 
505 QUICKLY!" THE TERRIBLE STRAIN REDUCING HIS WORDS TO A WHISPER.
506 AND AS I DID, THE BLADE OF THE GREAT SWORD SHATTERED, AND THE 
507 ROCK FELL BACK, SHAKING THE GROUND BENEATH ME.AGAIN, HE SPOKE. 
508 "ONCE AGAIN I MUST GO AWAY, MY CHILD. I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK
509 
510 "YOU MUST GO TO THE VILLAGE ELDERS, AND TELL THEM THAT YOU MUST
511 LEARN THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS. GIVE THEM THIS, HE SAID, TAKING
512 A RING FROM HIS FINGER, AND HANDING IT TO ME.THEY WILL KNOW 
513 IT'S MEANING, AND THEY WILL TEACH YOU. ON THE DAY OF YOUR EIGHT
514 TEENTH BIRTHDAY, YOU MUST RETRIEVE THE BOX FROM UNDER THE ROCK.
515 IN IT IS A MAP. WHEN YOU READ IT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND-IF YOU 
516 HAVE LEARNED FROM THE ELDERS-AND THEN YOU WILL KNOW WHAT IT IS 
517 THAT YOU MUST DO." AND NOW, MY CHILD, I MUST GO. REMEMBER THAT 
518 YOU HAVE A MISSION, AND THAT YOU MUST NOT FAIL. AND REMEMBER, 
519 MY CHILD, THAT I LOVE YOU." 
520 AND THEN HE WAS GONE. TO BE CONTINUED.
521 
522 
523 LOAM: THAT SHOULD HAVE STATED THAT YOU "WOULD" KNOW ME AS 
524 MICHELLE, NOT THAT YOU "DO" KNOW ME AS MICHELLE. MY NAME IS NOT
525 "MICHELLE"

532 If we're going to pursue a stroy line with wide appeal we
533 shoul incorporate some of the depth of the non-story entries
534 on BWMS I'd like to see a high-tech version of a medieval
535 morality play with Evil characters like Barren Intellect, Ab-
536 solute Power & Unbridled Lust battling Good guys like Pure 
537 Love, Sweet Reason, and Justace for all ( all the Good charach-
538 ters sound promiscuous).   Have them act out our ideas on the
539 proper use of machines and knowledge.  See what strange alli-
540 ances they form (Intellect and Justice start a law firm; Pure
541 Love and Power found the Roman Catholic Church).
542      People that take fantasy seriously grasp that the window
543 of our perceptions is tiny and dim.  Our picture of the world
544 is at best a blind-man's-view-of-the-elephant.  The internal
545 world that we build from these scraps of information is the one
546 one that we truly inhabit.  We want to build it pure and fine.
547 That's why patrons of the Inn are so passionately critical when
548 someone doesn't measure up morally or grammatically--a person's
549 inner world is precious and not to be ligxtly botched.  What
550 we're doing is important.  Fantasy, the basis of all science,
551 religion and philosphy, creates the "real" world.

568 I've got a question about the nuclear war debate:  Regarding the EMP, if
569 it knocks out ALL electrical workings, what about the other missles around
570 it?  Dosen't that mean that when one hits, it knocks out the other missles
571 (just by defalt)? If so, a nuclear war is not only crippling to the involved
572 nations, but is still limited in the  amount of damge sustained.  What do
573 you think?

576 The electro-magnetic pulse ruins any unprotected semiconducters by generatn
577 generating a high-voltage potential which blows the transistors.
578 One can harden a circuit with metal plate or "mu-metal", and the
579 warheads are so protected. However, the phone system, among other
580 things, isn't.

585 Here's another question for debate: Do you believe that most Americans (or people in general) are intellectual, 
586 anti-intellectual, or non-intellectual?  It seems to me, in recent times, that people in general are becoming non-
587 intellectual, being simply not interested in things that are intellectual.  William H. Whyte, Jr., cites as one
588 example, a well-known chemical company's recruiting film.  At one point, as three scientists are shown in a lab, a 
589 narrator comments: "No geniuses here - just a bunch of average Americans working together."
590 Do you believe that intellegent people are given less recognition than is their due?  Do you think it is fitting that
591 an official of the U.S. Office of Education blandly lumps together "the blind and the partially seeing, the deaf and 
592 the hard of hearing, the speech-defective, the crippled, the delicate, the epileptic, the mentally deficient, the 
593 socially maladjusted, and the extraordinarily gifted" ?  Strange bedfellows, indeed.  Think on it.
