21 Hi All,  I'm on top again.  I'm not suprised at all.

26 Kosta: Here! Hear! My sentiments exactly. I am sure GM will not appreciate the direction our story
27 took while we were away. The last KOSTA entry wis the last NET story entry as far as I am
28 concerned. We will continue from there.
29 Mikey: I will await the disk mailer. This modem program is interesting. But I see a few foolish coding
30 decisions in there... Thanks for all the help.
31 OAS members: I believe there already exists an organization such as yours in town. I have heard they
32 meet right after the GO players meet at PC&S. Are you a splinter group formerly associated with
33 them, or are you a new group on the scene?

38 may we, for the moment, assume that I am not lying on the floor bleeding from
39 thealmost certainly lethal discharge from the weapon of my "lover"? Yes? OK.
40 L'homme sans Parity:  TELL ME MORE!  Is there another group of creative
41         entities out there that enjoy the challange of "crankin' 'em out"?
42         Quite interested, am I, in learning that the meeting ground is so much
43         more the sophisticated highlight to more than just US writers.
44 Marci:  I,  I,  I...   But how?  After ALL I've done for You?
45         "How sharper than a serpant's tooth...?" and the like.
46  
47 the trigger was pulled and there was a bright flash of light in Jack's eyes.
48 everything began to melt before him.  He felt himself fall to the floor with
49 the speed of a feather.  As Marci turned towards the unlocked door, placing
50 the handgun back inther purse, Jack saw an expresion onther face thatthe was no
51 longer able to read.  How had thing changed?  Why did it end like this?  And
52  that of the others?  Tina and Tony?  Tony!  He was my friend, but he's become
53 such an Son of a B. lately.  Has he turned Marci against me?  Why, if it's the
54 last thing I do, it'll be evening the score with that low-life, brown leather
55 pants, know it all, big mouth jerk!
56 all things faded to black.  If Jack were to die now, it would not be in a pool
57 of his own blood, it would be more like drowning in his own tears.   Marci...
58 unconsciousness.

65 Zippy: I may have found a better way to go than EPSON, if i can scrape up
66 44-88$. Rember Kevin? The one that you never met? Well, he just(about 1hr
67 befor entering this message.)heard about a great deal on some japanise
68 diskdrives. Thay are double sided,Kevin was not sure about density(thay
69 do weird things in japian(sp, i know.)and if all goes well IBM compatiable.
70 that means, thay will work on my system. now the best part. the cost of one
71 of them is 44$! and the more you buy you get a discount.hopefully i will
72 be able to scrape together arround 88$ and kevin plans to get at least one
73 so we cane put in one big order(maby get some outher people in with us.)
74 and it will be MULTI-DRIVES for me!
75       Now all i have to do is to find 88$(anyone out their got any sigusti-
76 ons?).
77       How was IB? Jim & Ivan still doing fine?

81  OK folks. Keeping in mind that as far as the STORYLINE is concerned I
82 don't know about any of this....
83  . The entry that ORIGINALLY had GM surrendering had a line something
84 like "Ok, I can't shoot you now BUT IF YOU GIVE ME ANY TROUBLE NO MATTER
85 WHAT THE PROVOCATION..."(emphasis mine). "MARK" seem to have thought
86 about the implications of this statement.
87  . Deep down Fleming KNOWS he can't bring GM in alive. And he can't just
88 shoot her WITHOUT AN EXCUSE. This is just the kind of thing his twisted
89 logic might come up with.
90  . The type of search described IS done. I don't think GM deserves such
91 treatment, but it is "realistic".
92  . However I do feel that this scene IF it took place would not be 
93 taking place down the road, but more likely 10-30 yards from the cabin.
94  . This suggests that if GM concurs, she could start to take off her
95 COAT. Then while everyone is watching her, the agents in the cabin
96 would open up. If she does want to forget the whole thing, ok. (But
97 I still think that as per #1, Fleming will try something equally
98 OUTRAGEOUS to give himself an excuse to shoot her).
99 6. Moving on to other subjects, entries from 09 are to be disregarded 
100 until I can have a LONG talk with him about appropriate technology &
101 not mangling other people's storylines. (Are you listening 09?)
102 7. I still can't believe that such a group of "NET's finest" would 
103 meekly let GM surrender and then sit around discussing how THEY were
104 going to escape!!
105 	If I "really" knew that this was going on you'd ALL be up on charges!

107 ps. spy stories are noted for "gratuitous sex & violence". Well we've 
108 had the violence. I guess someone wanted to supply the sex! At least he
109 stopped BEFORE anything had really happened....

136                         
137                        I was but a simple man
138                        With no great tales to tell
139                        And there were other tellers
140                        Who always told them well
141  
142                        They told tales of other lands
143                        And people they had seen
144                        The beauty of a maiden
145                        The hue of some stones glean
146 
147                        I thought if I were more like them
148                        The things that I would see
149                        I thought if I were bolder
150                        The teller could be me
151  
152                        I'd begun considering
153                        What might be wrong with me
154                        When would these great happenings
155                        Start happening to me
156  
157                        And still I sat and listened
158                        While other people talked
159                        And told of distant travels
160                        And roads that they had walked
161 
162                        But as for sitting quietly
163                        That time is finally past
164                        For when it comes to telling tales
165                        My time has come at last
166 
167                        I needn't sit and listen
168                        To hear their endless wail
169                        For I have seen a Dragon
170                        And lived to tell the tale
171

203 These words came echoing into my left ear, they could not be stopped.  Once
204 had been spoken, a person of great stature side stepped to stand in front of
205 me, hourglass in hand.  From what I could see the sands of the hourglass were
206 dropping so slowly that they could almost be counted as they fell.

220 away, high quality electronics equiptment sitting on bricks and boards next
221 to the ugliest couch and chairs you have ever layed eyes on. Fine china
222 with dried leftovers sitting on the kitchen counter next to the empty diskwasher.
223 4 cats of various ages and sexes are sunning themselves in the front room.
224 One of the cats, Diablo by name is sunning himself up on the dinning room table.
225 The kitchen is full of empty boxes signify a recent move in. The tv set in the
226 living room is broadcasting "Wheel of fortune" a tv in the small bedroom sounds
227 like a football game.  The bookcase contains a collection of history biographies

236    For another endless moment, the piper gazed at the dragon before him, eyes
237 glazed in wonder at this shy monarch of the skies.  Slowly, he put out his
238 hand to meet the cautiously outhrust head, returning in kind the tentative
239 welcome.  Softly he ran his hand down the angle of the dragon's jaw, the
240 texture of the scales like nubbed velvet beneath his fingertips.  As his
241 fingers traveled in the caress, tiny thrills, like shocks just on the
242 threshold of detectability, travelled up his arm and shoulder.  He slowly
243 dropped his hand, reluctant to break the contact with this strange creature,
244 but aware that the chance meeting might not occur again.  For a long moment,
245 he stood, gazing into the intellegent eyes of the creature.
246   Suddenly, a nudge from the pegasus reminded the piper of why he had come.
247 placing his arm about the pegasus' neck, he turned to the creature.
248    "Lovely creature of the skies, we go to ride the moonlight an drink the
249 wine-rich night air above the valley.  If the one whom you bore here and
250 you, yourself wish to share the sky roads with us, Peg and I would be
251 most glad to ride with you."

302                           I look across the bartop
303                           And what should my eyes see
304                           But a banana margarita
305                           And a strawberry daiquiri
306                           Ordered by two members
307                           Of an oreo society
308 
309                           It feels so strange to meet them
310                           like someting from a dream
311                           So to show them that my cocktails
312                           Are not always what they seem
313                           I suggest a mixture
314                           Of oreos and ice cream
315 
316                           We talk of small things for awhile
317                           Then much to my delight
318                           One requests a placemat 
319                           And settles down to write
320                           Soon a not-so-subtle play on words
321                           Is delivered to my sight
322 
323                           So I promise them a poem
324                           To thank them for the smile
325                           But I feel I must apoligise
326                           It has taken quite a while
327                           But now I can rest easy
328                           With THIS placemat in my file
329                                                          a toast from
330                                                            THE TIN MAN

332 *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
333                             Rite of Passage
334      Slowly, the crystal moon descended over the rooftops.  Darkness
335 gripped the city.  The air was still... expectant.  Rats scuttled through
336 the night scavenging for food.  It was the 'dead' time; the hours before
337 dawn when few humans ventured into the streets.  Those who did were
338 watchful, alert for misfortune.
339      From the east, headlights pierced the purple blackness.  A police car
340 moved like a silent predator.  The tight beam of its spotlight probed empty
341 alleyways, searching.  The harsh glare paused on a dog sifting through a
342 trash can, then moved on.  The soft rumble of the vehicle's engine was
343 punctuated by the crackle of a police radio.
344      Inside, a large man with a gold shield on his chest slipped a tape
345 about it himself.  He had faced danger on more that one occasion in his
346 career.  But he had not yet stood at death's shoulder.  Like most cops, he
347 often rehearsed how he would react to a menacing gunman or in a heated
348 shootout.  The moment still awaited him.
349      Deep inside, Frank worried.  Would he be able to drop the hammer when
350 he had to?  To take a human life was an enormous responsibility, especially
351 with his deep sense of humanity.  As one of his professors used to say;
352 "Life is a voyage."  Frank's problem was deciding his own destination.
353      It had been a quiet night.  A few drunks, a couple of minor problems to
354 be resolved, a domestic battle that ended with the combatants falling into
355 each other's arms.  Frank's intense eyes peered into the vacant lots and 
356 alleys of the city.  In a few hours, dawn would arrive; another tour into a
357 reality few experienced would be over.
358      As Frank rounded a corner, he spied something unusual in the distance;
359 two figures in the shadows.  He killed his headlights and moved forward. 
360 They seemed intent and did not notice him.  Frank's heart started to thump
361 faster.  In an instant, he realized what was happening:  rape.  A man held
362 a gun on a woman pushing her down to the pavement.
363      Frank moved into action, pushing the accelerator to the floor.  His
364 engine responded with a throaty roar; the car leaping forward in 
365 anticipation.  He snatched the radio microphone and called for assistance.
366 Familiar voices quickly responded they were on the way.
367      The gunman looked up in surprise.  His act of violation interrupted.
368 Frank had only an instant to realize that he was a young black man.  Then he
369 was gone, racing off into the darkness, seeking escape.
370      The police car squealed to a halt in front of the trembling victim.
371 Frank dived from the car.  "Are you alright?"  he quickly asked the woman.
372 An ashen face nodded yes.
373      Frank turned and ran after the gunman, surrendering a 30 yard lead at
374 the start.  Frank knew this wasn't a leisurely jog on a forest trail.  This
375 was an ancient struggle; two predators moving in the darkness, seeking 
376 victory or escape.

381                       Many times I've seen your words
382                       Of strange and mystical lands
383                       Webs of words draw pictures
384                       Spun with delicate strands
385  
386                       Always with words so graceful
387                       are the flowings of your pen
388                       I wish that I could do so
389                       With these cold hands of tin
390 
391                       I have met a woman
392                       A Lady of renound
393                       Instead of pictures in her words
394                       She creats the other way 'round
395 
396                       You speak of an aquaintence
397                       I think it must be her
398                       So pensive was our conversation
399                       There's no way to be sure
400 
401                       And to you, the Piper
402                       I tip my hat of tin
403                       And imagine words of distant lands
404                       And how they might begin
405                                                      a toast from THE TIN MAN
406 To All: I realize that poems are a real waste of disk space, but I can find no
407         other way to enter them that has the same effect as the normal lines 
408         and verses.  I DID owe a few poems, I will try not to eat so much of a 
409         disk as I did this time.
410                                             Sincerly, THE TIN MAN

413 Fellows: Could you be a bit more specific? I prefer to know what I am
414 being disliked for. I pointed out a way of fitting an objectionable
415 entry into the story IF Gaudy was willing. I left the decision up to HER
416 The only thing that I was firm about was that Fleming is NOT gboing to
417 meekly take her back to HQ if he can find an excuse to report "shot 
418 while resisting" or "shot while attempting to escape". 
419         Also, where did you get this "leader of men" bit? I pull strings
420 from behind the scenes. I don't lead. Leaders are FIELD operatives. Not
421 executives.
422 09: One of the main objections to your entry was the question of how you
423 got there & how you had found out about the situation. HQ doesn't even
424 know about it yet!!

434 Still sitting in the shadows of the INN,  THOR could see his favorite.
435 Yes, was she, kathyd, and another near was delicate in his words as
436 much as she with her prose. This man did call himself  a person made of
437 tin but THOR could see that his metal was much stronger than that.
438 Others were still at the INN, squabbling over texts that each had
439 felt an attack. But it was not for real as each was in awe of the other.
440 It was good, even to see the OREO eater for only a short time. And it
441 was good to see that all were i.nvolved with each other.
442 THOR would come back to the INN again, maybe in the early morning hours
443 when all had been said and the words still echoed in the halls of the 
444 INN.

446   ive been sitting here having a pleasant daydream about a place. This
447 place is the center and all realities can be reached from here. Over 
448 each door is a sign, "fear" reads one, "adventure" reads another, and
449 these are just the doors that i am standing in front of. Down a few 
450 paces i see "love" and "suspense
451    at my right is a dispensing machine, it dispenses escapes. before 
452 one enters a room they take a escape with them. these escapes are very
453 valuable and must be kept safe, for once in a room, a trapped person or
454 thing will try to con you out of your escape. i am a newcommer here and
455 i don't know which door to chose, "success" looks promising but danger-
456 ous. "beauty" beacons, but i ignore that door for now.
457   i turn and take my escape, it is a very interresting object. i put my
458 escape in my pants pocket and choose "courage". As i open "courages" 
459 door fear disapears, i step in and find my self in a airplane, a chute
460 is strapped to my back. i pat my pocket, escape is there waiting, the
461 target is near... and i jump. what a feeling this "courage" is, im a
462 free spirt drifting down towards the earth, i check my altimeter, time
463 to pull the ripcord. whoosh, the chute is a rainbow and i float with the
464 winds. i like courage, im going to have to do that again. as my feet
465 touch the ground and chute falls behind me, i disentagle myself and pull
466 my escape out of my pocket. the heat of my hand activates escape and
467 i find my self back at the center of realities.

470 A FEW WORDS.  WITH ADVENTURE COMES FEAR. THE UNKNOWN IS AHEAD AND FAILURE AT
471 EVERY STEP. DECISIONS. WITH LOVE COMES SUSPENSE. WHAT WILL THE LOVER THINK?
472 THIS IS NOT SUSPENSE. THIS IS ANXIETY. SUCCESS? BEAUTY? BOTH OF THESE ARE 
473 SHOWN CLEARLY WITH THE WORDS YOU HAVE JUST GIVEN US. AND COURAGE IS SOMETHING
474 YOU HAVE ALWAYS HAD. I CAN TELL. THIS IS AN ODD SENSATION SEEING MY WORDS
475 ENGRAVED HERE.THEY WILL LAST FOR A SHORT TIME AND WILL THEN FADE AWAY. I WILL
476 MISS MY WORDS. BUT NOT HALF AS MUCH AS I WILL MISS THE WORDS THAT ARE ALL
477 AROUND ME. THEY HAVE MEANING. MINE ARE DUST.

486 interpreted in any particular way, please
487 do me one respect and do not use my border
488 or pen name, makes me nervous. also the
489 word stalking makes me quite uneasy too.
490 i intend to enter other rooms from the
491 center of realities and will tell all
492 what i have found there. who knows maybe
493 i won't return next time. i think i will

524 Tin Man -- Tanks much!  I, also, do not feel that the blank space in poetry
525 is a waste of space.  The physical placement of the words in the line has a
526 great utility.  Somehow, however, the medium has different constraints than
527 pen or type on paper... an interesting field to explore?  Although I greatly
528 appreciated your entry, I'm afraid that the mutual acquaintance may be someone
529 other than the one to whom you referred -- I (believe?) that I know that person
530 only through reputation and reading her writings.
531   Ahh! what joy to type once more on a responsive keyboard.  The only ill effects 
532 of my recent keyboard troubles is a distressing tendency to attempt driving
533 the <return> key through the keyboard when I reach the end of a line!

561   AHA - some space, if only temporary.  will anyone get to see it??
562   person looked around the interior of the oddly familiar INN.  A beconing hand,
563 with mug attached, raised in friendship, from a warm corner table drew person's
564 attention.
565       Mug and hand were attached to one who introduced himself as 'Gaurdian'.  The invitation to
566 taste the INN's fine ales was one person could hardly refuse.  "while i lack gender, and even 
567 permanent appearence",person said by way of introduction,"i have sometimes been mystakenly
