31 	It was a bleak land.  Rolling hills of jumbled stone
32 stretched to the horizon.  A pale red sun, half-hidden by
33 perpetual clouds, struggled to warm the chill air.  The only
34 sound was the shrill whistling of the north wind.
35 	Magus pulled his cloak closer about him as he surveyed the
36 desolate world.  He stood in front of the only artificial
37 structure visible, a squat stone building that rambled across the
38 crest of a hill.  God, he hated this place, but The Calling was
39 upon him and he could not refuse the summons.  He turned and 
40 entered the building.
41 
42 	"Well, Magus," the demon said, "you certainly took your time
43 in coming."
44 	"I came as soon as I could, my Lord."
45 	"You came only because I demanded it."  The demon waved his
46 scaled fist.  "I have a task for you."
47 	"Such as . . ."
48 	"You will journey to the Great Library on Alexander's World
49 and do some reference work for me."
50 	"Not again," Magus said.
51 	"Yes, again.  I weary of your insolence.  It is time for you
52 to reaffirm your vow.  Say the words . . ."
53 	Magus stood mute before the demon.  There was never any love
54 between them.
55 	"Say the words or feel my wrath.  You conjured me but could
56 not control me.  Your ambition for power was greater than your
57 ability."  The demon held up a pulsing mass, Magus' heart.  "Now,
58 say the words . . ."
59 	Magus grimmaced and said, "I am yours to command."
60 	"Of course you are.  Think of it this way, I have given you
61 eternal life . . . or is that eternal damnation?"  The demon's
62 laughter echoed through the stone hall.

68 The white cat rolled over in her patch of sunlight, trying to get
69 comfortable.  She lay on her stomach, head on her paws, her tail
70 twitching with irritation.  The sun felt too hot, the birds were
71 making distracting noises, she felt restless.  She jumped to her feet
72 and darted into the shadows by the temple wall.  She rubbed her side
73 against the old bricks of the wall, but that didn't feel right--it
74 wasn't enough.  The restlessness increased.  She grew more irritated,
75 her tail twitched even faster.  She felt an itch somewhere that she
76 was unable to scratch.
77      Suddenly the shape-changer's human brain took over.  She
78 recognized the source of the cat's restlessness and irritability and
79 realized the need for immediate action.  If she couldn't change to one
80 of her human forms, very soon the cat instincts would take over
81 completely, and she would find herself the bad tempered but willing
82 focus of attention for every male cat in the vicinity--she was going
83 into heat!  Far better to be a human female with a lusty urge than a
84 female cat out of control.  She didn't even want to consider the
85 possibility of bearing and rearing a litter of kittens.  She had to
86 act fast!
87      Using all of the override power she could muster, the changer
88 forced the cat's body to run down the hill toward the river.  Once on
89 the riverbank, she had the cat curl into a sleeping position on the
90 grass, and closed her eyes.  There was no time to waste contemplating
91 a new destination, she would return to the world of the Inn, and the
92 shape of the one crone.  Once there she could, at leisure, make the
93 necessary decisions.  She quelled the rebellious cat portion of her
94 brain and soothed herself into calmness.  She thought the name Hobeth
95 and silently intoned the sacred vows of transformation.  She
96 remembered the pond near the Inn with the willow trees surrounding it.
97 She remembered the body of the old woman.  Her thought patterns
98 started resembling those of that form.
99      A few minutes passed.  The white cat got to her feet and slowly
100 walked into the swift flowing water of the river.  Two boys who had
101 been playing in the mud at the edge of the river, stared at the sight
102 of the small white cat calmly walking into the water until it
103 completely disappeared.  When they told their friends about it later,
104 nobody believed them.  Everyone knows that cats hate water.

108 oh, what lovely dribble has been written since my departure from frequenting the bwms.
109 it seems as if nothing has changed
110 oh well....
111 <_>---> I don't know what this does, but it's pointed at you!!!
112 When last we left, our begraggled hero was up a tree... or out on a limb, more 
113 to the point.  After all, even if the ground is a bit less steady, you can see
114 a *lot* farther.  However, one look was enough to convince VanderVecken that
115 the Inn was a far more interesting place to be than the tree... Especially
116 with that short blue man over there waving his arms at him.  Down, however,
117 is no small feat when your brain is attempting to go into orbit, or at least
118 reach escape velocity.  After much effort, he reaches the base of the tree,
119 to find that the blue man was not nearly as small as he appeared.  Moreover,
120 the blue man is definitely displeased.  Sorting things out, VanderVecken soons
121 begins to comprehend the blue man's problem.  Over near the path there is a
122 small sign.  "Please Don't Walk on the Grass."  Not one to offend, at least
123 not more than is intentional, he hurries back to the Inn, muttering "If you
124 don't like the way I walk, stay off the lake...," as he goes.  Of course,
125 he now has a serious problem: how to get back into the Inn.  Well, going 
126 through the windows is effective, but frowned upon.  Therefore, the door.
127 Only one problem: Where is the door???  Walking all around the Inn, he finds
128 no door.  This is a puzzler.  Perhaps if I try walking the other way?  
129 Thisd seems to be more effective - at least he recognizes all the scenery!
130 After walking aroun four times, he decides to give up and explore the
131 countryside.  Perhaps an answer lies there.  And where *did* that blue man go?

137 S/S/(etc): I have no idea what you mean by 'duplicity'. But even a poly-
138 alphabetic cipher shows letter frequency. You just calculate the 'index
139 of coincidence' for various key lengths. When you hit the correct key 
140 length the the Ci will be close to .067 (the larger the Ci the more the
141 *plaintext* diverges from English [or any other language!]).
142 Transposition Ciphers don't have *any* effect on letter frequencies so
143 they are easily checked for.
144 The remaining possibilities are a true code (unlikely given the length
145 of the messages, code is *briefer* than plaintext). Or some advanced
146 techniques that will still show patterns under proper analysis.
147 The remaining choice is a poly-alphabetic with a key length >= the
148 length of the msg (one-time pads). Only problem is if you use the same
149 key for several msgs, then one "merely" has to do the tests on the set
150 of characters in a given position in the msg. If you use a different key
151 for each msg, you now have to distribute a volume of keys> the volume of
152 msgs!! (thus you might as well send the msgs as send the keys...)
153 The last two or three msgs *that I analyzed* had an essentially FLAT
154 frequency distribution. This only matches one-time pads or a random
155 'dummy' msg.
156 *IF* I don't have anything better to do (unlikely) I'll check the msg
157 on the previous disk...

188 KremVax, well, the story goes something like this... Take some horny marines
189 is the USSR, tempt them with some russian sex kittens, and then using
190 blackmail, have them smuggle DEC Microvax parts out of Boston through a
191 secret series of package stations going down through the south from Florida
192 to Cuba, and eventually to Moscow. Use the same sex-ploy on some nerdly
193 unix hackers at University of California at Berkeley. Then blackmail them
194 into bringing a Microvax version of the 4.2bsd distribution tapes over via
195 airliner (the 4.3 networking stuff doesn't work on the uvax yet, but the
196 ruskies are happy with 4.3). Then have this sex-satisfied computer nerd
197 set up the microvax with full Berekely UUCP and SMTP, hook it in to seismo
198 through a trans-atlantic fiber-optic link, and voila, the Russians are on
199 usenet, with gateways to ARPA and CSNET. Our countries highest military
200 secrets available to some lunatic hackers who happen to have first names
201 like Ivan and Peitor. It is all so easy, so quick, and because of the sex
202 in the equation, so unfailing. Hence, you have kremvax. Percival is a
203 similar setup, except instead of Russians the culprits were Oregonians,
204 but most of the rest of the scenario was carried out in a similar manner.
205 Oh, instead of using DEC microvax parts, they used an old Tektronix work-
206 station for their nefarious plans. The god fearing unix and xenix sites in
207 the Portland metro-area put up with percival only because it somehow managed
208 to get UUCP connections with a bunch of those left-wingers at Reed college,
209 which I guess is no surprise, considering the political slant that
210 particular institution has.
211 
212 What can be learned from these intruders on the net? 
213 
214 Sex is a very powerful weapon.
215 Sex can get you just about anything.
216 Only send married marines to hostile countries.
217 Take the Forever Wars/Aliens approach and have coed Marine platoons with
218 approval of fratinization.
219 Never let UCB computer nerds without girl friends get their hands on a
220 distribution tape.
221 Simply give the Russians at AT&T 7300, let them get disgusted with the slow
222 speed, and they will give up on unix of their own accord.
223 
224 History always gives us 20/20 sight.

261     Gildor came back into the common room wiping excess oil from his
262 hands onto the rag he found on the back steps of the Inn.  His scaly
263 friend's itch wasn't nearly as bad as the complaints had made it
264 sound, but Gildor was glad to have caught it early.  Dry, patchy skin
265 is bad news on a fire-lizard.
266     While he was taking care of his dragon's problem, Gildor thought
267 about his own task.  He had been told of a mage who might lend a hand
268 in the search, but had yet to see anyone who matched the description
269 of either him or his familiars.  True, he could be amoung these
270 various travelers here at the Inn, but the 'vibes' weren't right. 
271 There was no feeling of the magic this person was supposed to possess.
272     Maybe Jaqew was wrong?  Gildor thought for a moment.  No, that
273 couldn't be.  Jaqew was very adamant about who to find and where to
274 find him.  He said this mage would be useful as he was well
275 practiced in treasure hunts and the insurance business.  Gildor just
276 had to keep looking.
277     Another bitter might help, Gildor decided.  He had a mug filled
278 and began to mingle with the patrons, listening for any mention of the
279 mage known as Milchar.

286 Several hours passed before the mage realized that this world was indeed barren
287 of civilization; perhaps of native intelligent life.  He sat upon a large 
288 granite boulder which marked a gentle curve in the river he had been following.
289 While he rested, he again examined his palm, looking again for the symbol that
290 had shined brightly there for just a moment.  Again he found that he could not
291 find it, try as he might, with whatever senses he chose to use.  It looked as
292 it always had.  But it felt different.
293 The sun was low in the sky as the mage decided to attempt a spell of transport.
294 He spread his magical implements before him, and surveyed them thoughtfully.
295 His trusty 3 x 5 cards had taken the dousing well, thanks to the foresight of
296 using vellum material to write the dweomers upon.
297 He smiled to himself as he spied a grey-colored card near the bottom of the 
298 pack, which he withdrew and studied, his eyes glinting in the sun's last light.
299 'Porlombic grandoluxim, werfidulon askuyabyn dolazuntiv, eksah!' he chanted,
300 gathering together his posessions and focusing the ability of power within him,
301 channeling it outwards and directing it in intricate patterns that wove a 
302 sphere of silvery threads that appeared to be the work of dozens of mad 
303 spiders.  The silvery globe briefly outshined the dying sun, then contracted 
304 slowly to a point, leaving the river alone to bubble and babble to itself in
305 private.
306 A dimmer sphere of silver expanded from a point near the mainmast of the R.S.
307 Razor's Edge an instant later, like an expanding soap bubble which broke to
308 release a tired and scruffy-looking mage upon the deck.  Carefully making his
309 way down to his quarters, he collapsed into a hammock that stretched across 
310 the cabin, and fell instantly asleep.
311 The Razor took care of her master, and gently rocked him as she floated upon
312 a small creek over which a footbridge crossed, which in turn was part of a
313 path to a cozy Inn with a large oaken door.  The limbs of the Rowan tree
314 seemed to move a bit as if waving hello to the returning dweomercrafter, who
315 slept peacefully after his efforts.

343 When all else fails, ask someone who looks like they belong here.  So 
344 saythinking, VanderVecken heads for the blue man, who is *still* waving
345 his arms wildly.  "Ybleth!," the man cried.  Rising to the challenge, 
346 VanderVecken cried "Blue!"  Now we're getting somewhere, he thought.  
347 Perhaps this besotten meanie could help me back to the Inn. "Do you know
348 he way back to the Inn?"  "Oh, you speak English!," the meanie cried.
349 w"Well, in answer to your question, the Inn is right over there... Or is 
350 it left over there???," he looks around quizically.  Waving VanderVecken
351 toward the path (a Blue Brick Road), the blue meanie wanders off.  "Well,
352 if thats the how of it...," VanderVecken wanders along down the path.
353 A short walk down the path, he sees a large sign labelled "IN ->"
354 "A-Ha, perhaps this goes somewhere!"  Attempting to follow the sign, 
355  finds himself in a rather large See of wholes (It's positively amazing
356 at the Catholic church is doing these day).  What can you do in a see 
357 of wholes?  Chase the papal submaarine of course, and listen to fairly
358 passable 60's music by the Bugs (We've got the quteset little cameras
359 hangin' everywhere, after a while you'll just forget they're there...)

387 Sleep  had refreshed Milchar wonderfully, and he awoke rested and ravenous.
388 His body sported bruises which ached painfully as he moved, but such was his
389 cheer that the mage hardly noticed.  He was back again!
390 After he found one of his other garments, be felt human again- again decked out
391 in a striking shade of blue, with small silver threads running along a few 
392 lines here and there.  One by one the many tools of his trade found their way
393 into the large pockets hidden about his robe.  All but one tool- Milchar
394 lacked his wand.  It would take a lot of searching to find another of the same
395 power, with perfect balance and channeling ability.
396 The bright morning sun shone upon Milchar as he climbed onto the deck, 
397 unclouding his mind with such thoughts and filling it with new appreciation for
398 the spring flowers blooming in the valley.  He whistled an ancient ballad of
399 magical adventure as he stepped upon the bank and made his way towards the Inn,
400 where he knew a hot, hearty breakfast awaited him.
401 Minutes later he opened the large oaken door and let himself into the familiar
402 common room of the Inn.  Many people satat scattered tables, chatting with
403 one another and sharing the morning gossip.  A few glanced at Milchar standing
404 inside the door; a few others recogized him; and a handful wondered what had
405 happened to him since his abrupt disappearance some weeks ago.  One man, near
406 the rear, at a table with a small dragon, gazed at him intently.
407 The man behind the counter was not the Innkeeper, but served Milchar quickly
408 and efficiently.  "Just takin' care of things while  he's gone."
409 "Where has he gone?  I have not known him to leave without very good reason."
410 "No one I've talked to knows.  Excuse me, I must wait on another gentleman.
411 Good day."  Milchar watched him move off to stand near another table.
412 He sat down near one wall, and began to attack the feast before him, fending
413 off questions with a small grin.

416 Leonard, the bluer says it is done, will check and see if it is, and will 
417 pick it up if it is, what can I say, the bluer screwed it up the first time
418 and it has taken him this long to correct it.

422 you will be hearing from me just as soon as I am done with the paper work
423 generated by my mothers death, and this is only a few days away, and with 
424 the way things have gone lately, I don't think you will be happy about it
425 as I don't take being ignored well at all, and now have more than sufficent
426 cash to remady this matter!!!!!!

496 Jim Michaels: I've been to busy to run your tranpostion cipher through
497 any of the programs (or even attack it manually!). Note however, that a
498 cipher is (in general) easier to crack if either the messages are long
499 or there are a lot of them. Thus short 'one-liners' are almost
500 impossible to crack...
501 010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
502 Should I tell him?  And this guy is Mr. know it all of ciphers...
503 Take a look at the one-liner cipher again.  Now read the left-most digit,
504 then right most digit (character), moving inward alternating from left
505 to right.

539     Gildor watched carefully as a 'gentleman' in a bright blue outfit
540 stepped into the Inn.  Several of whom seemed to be the regulars
541 merrily welcomed the traveller with the name that Gildor was looking
542 for.  "Milchar, where've you been?  How did you disappear?"  was the
543 general cry, along with requests for more provisions.
544     The power that emminated from this new being suggested that this
545 was the mage of whom Jaqew had spoken, but the outward appearance
546 seemed less an old wisened wizard and more a simple traveller.  "That
547 could be an advantage," Gildor reasoned.  The slaps on the back and the
548 explainations soon subsided, and Gildor creeped in closer to meet this
549 mage.
550     "Good morrow," ventured Gildor with the slight elven lilt evident
551 in his speech.
552     "And to you also," the mage replied between mouths of potato bread
553 and bratwurst.  "You're new here?  I don't remember meeting you before."
554     "Just in from the plains."  Gildor knew that was a weak
555 explanation, the Inn being surrounded by mountians.  "I see you're
556 friends are happy to see you've returned."
557     The mage eyed Gildor suspiciously.  Something seemed a bit forced in
558 the stranger's manner.
559     "I'm Gildor the Green, and this is Mel, my fire-lizard.  We've
560 come on a rather long walk to find someone, and we were wondering if
561 you might be of help."
562     The mage merely raised an eyebrow.
563     The table had cleared a little and there was little chance of
564 being over heard.  Gildor set Mel on the table and went on.  "We have
565 a small quest before us, and were told to find a friend of the
566 Doctor's.  A mage known as Milchar, possibly accompanied by a small
567 apprentice.  We were informed that this mage was well versed in the
568 arts and would possibly be of service.  If we could find him, that is. 
569 I believe I'm correct in assuming that you are the mage known as
570 Milchar?"
571     Milchar nodded, and took another bite of bratwurst.
572     "Would you be interested in a possibly short and probably
573 profitable journey?"
574     "How short and how profitable?"
575     Milchar seemed interested, but Gildor still wasn't sure. 
576 Obviously just returning from some adventure, perhaps the mage would
577 be too fatigued for what was in store.  Jaqew seemed certain, though,
578 so Gildor blundered on.
579     "Are you familiar with the Shield of Palidore and the Dungeons of
580 Mariha?"
581     The mage called Milchar almost choked on his ale in surprise. 
582     "I thought you might be."

608 Noted industrialist Hammond Armour glanced with irritation at the stack of
609 papers demanding his signature or his condemnation. Nothing likely today
610 to be overly profitable, creative, or benevolent.  He was a strange kind of
611 capitalist. His juices flowed best when both money and good works were
612 involoved--and he saw no need for these interests to be conficting. But
613 paperwork!  There was no good about it.  Wilma Banks strode in.  She was
