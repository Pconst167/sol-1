 59 Mike,
 60   In working with your BiosCrt unit I just discovered you're located
 61 in the same part of the world as me (Portland area)...and I'm wondering
 62 if you might know someone (or combination of people) locally that I
 63 might be able to hire to work on a software project with me.  Ideally
 64 it would be about a 3 month full-time situation (or equivalent if 
 65 several were involved), and is TP5.5 based using Object Professional's
 66 libraries (in part).  The application is a fun one (at least for me!):
 67 it's for networked high school/college labs w/lots of screen sharing
 68 and application coordination to support group work/cooperative learning.
 69 Expertise needed includes TP5.5 OOP, familiarity with Opro, and
 70 technical knowledge of ISR control of hardware (keyboard, screen,
 71 mouse).  
 72 
 73 I'd be glad to share further details if you'd like.  You can call me
 74 at 275-xxxx or 'plex me back or send email to dbsr@psuorvm.bitnet as
 75 you prefer.  
 76   Thanks, Mike.

 90 Figures.  LHSP: The C compiler works, produces executables I can run, but
 91 I have to be careful of SCO-specific stuff that believes certain #defines
 92 are around, such as M_UNIX and M_XENIX.  Ecu compiles and runs (I am using
 93 it now) but the support programs core-dump and the curses support is
 94 somewhat funny at times.  I'm going to try some more software and I'll

128 CM- I ran my fill routine on your torture test, and it passed.  I
129 suppose this means you want to see the algorithm now?  :-)
130 It uses an array of records for the point stack (5 bytes per point),
131 and is not recursive.  A large fill such as yours requires about 200
132 points to be on the point stack, max.  It's SLOW, though.  It uses
133 getpixel() and line() to read and draw pixels.  I'd dearly love an
134 assembly translation.

136 YES! please do send me the routine. I might be able to incorporate
137 it into the BGI driver I'm currently working on. The current
138 floodfill I'm using blows up if it goes off screen, and I haven't
139 had time to find out why. It also tends to be rather hoggy with
140 the stack. Though not overly so.

158 on te next disk chang there will be an upgrade to the system software.
159 there will be a new room added. This is in preperation for the next 
160 change which will increase the size of the mail room which has been 
161 experiencing indigestion. Normally it isn't a problem unless old mail
162 backs up and the room gets full. Anyway, the change is to move the 
163 mens, and ladies rooms to a sperate disk drive. The new room is being
164 created to test the new configuration out. I had been meaning to add the
165 room ever since the new system was brought on line, but space limitations 
166 prevented it from being added to the same drive as all the other rooms.
167 I've changd the software to allow the ifles to be moved to a seperate disk
168 I don't want to actually move the files until the new setup is tested out
169 though, so I've added thenew room to test the waters first.
170 The new room will be called the Blue room, and like the mens and ladies rooms, 
171 it will be limited access. The room will be like the old Blue Parrot
172 blue room, orientedtowards "blue" subject matter. The "F" word is allowed, 
173 but keep in mind that the "F" word will still attivate the auto-twit 
174 function if you are outside the blue room, so be careful if you 
175 have a desire to use the word. 
176 Let me know what you think about all this. Oh yes, you must be 21 or older
177 to gain access to the room. To gain access sendprivate mail to me.
