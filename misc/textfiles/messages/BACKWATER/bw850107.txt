20 L'homme: Stupid generic disks. Sigh. I'll get you replacments next time
21 I see you. In the mean time, try taking the disks out of the black jackets,
22 check them for damage, if they need it, clean them with Isopropol alchohol,
23 then put them back in the jacket and tape it back together. That sometimes
24 will do the trick. (Don't get heavy with the Alchohol, use VERY light pressure.
25 don't worry about leaving streeks, that's normal.
26 
27 M.S.: Huh?
28 
29 All: Sorry about not changing disks sooner, some things came up which prevented
30 me from getting into here to take care of it.
31 
32 Pam: Did you get a chance to try the CPM system?
33 (For that matter, did you even see the message?)
34 
35 L'homme again: Actually, just about anything could have happened to them,
36 they were kicking around underfoot for several days before I passed them on
37 to you. It wouldn't surprise me if someone dumped something on them and
38 just didn't say anything. Oh well, they are replacable, so no real big deal.

41 Thanks Mikey. As you said, no big deal. I'll try to cleaner. I have taken
42 disks apart before, with sometimes good luck and sometimes not-so-good
43 luck. I'll let you know how it comes out. Also, sorry I didn't get a
44 chance to give you a call. Today was add/zoo day at school, and I spent
45 most of the day standing in line. As the commercial says, "I HATE TO WAIT!"

47 Why do people lurk? Maybe because they know whatever they say wouldn't
48 be heard anyway. And maybe they don't have anything worth saying, or
49 writing a story about.

51    Petrov sat immersed in black stillness, knowing that light in the hall and
52 darkness in the apartment would give him an advantage over anyone entering the
53 room.  It was only a short time before the doorknob began to slowly turn.
54 The door creeped open, revealing a man with a gun.  As Petrov's eyes adjusted
55 to the light, the man's face began to gain definition. That face...
56 that face...  THAT FACE!  Petrov's attention altered such that he no longer saw
57 the gun, no longer saw the beaten man standing next to... that face!
58    Time slowed for all but Petrov.  In the time it took his heart to make a
59 single beat, Petrov was washed in a gamut of emotions -- scenes of the past
60 flashed in his mind.  Joshua!  Ghost?  Couldn't be... couldn't be...
61    Nervous energy flooded his body and his mind.  Quickly he turned in a ninety
62 degree angle, raised the collar of his trenchcoat (which he had found in the
63 occupant's closet) and tilted his hat to obscure his face.  The lights which
64 Joshua activated danced off the beads of sweat trickling down Petrov's face.
65 "Don't move," Joshua's voice was low and even.  "Who are you and what are you
66 doing in my apartment?"  (Fellows went straight for the couch.)
67    "Call me a friend," Petrov responded.  "I did a little housecleaning for
68 you."  He stiffly motioned at the dead body on the floor, his voice
69 uncharacteristically shaky.
70    Joshua glanced at the green-clad body and was just about to speak when a
71 voice came from behind him.  "Why don't we all just hold it a minute."
72 Petrov had never seen the man enter the doorway; all he could think about was
73 Joshua.  He couldn't let Joshua know who he was--at least not yet.
74    With gun in hand, the man who had just entered circled the room until he had
75 a clear view of everyone.  After whispering something into a small
76 communications device he took a long look at the other three.  "What a pretty
77 picture we have here.  Listen, I don't feel like playing games.  My name's
78 Farley.  Which one of you is Joshua?"
79    "I'm Joshua," Joshua said.
80    "No, I'm Joshua," interjected Petrov.
81    Farley looked expectantly at Fellows.  Nothing.  "Well, would the real
82 Joshua please -"  Farley was interrupted by his wristwatch/comset.
83 
84   "Come in Farley."  Farley backed away and lowered the volume on his watch.
85 "This better be important, Fred."
86    "I've run the voice pattern check you wanted."
87    "Already?"
88    "One voice was incredibly easy to trace.  He was filed under recent news
89 broadcasts. The second man who told you he was Joshua is actually a man
90 (and I use the term loosely) named Petrov.  He's known for his rather strange
91 habits involving sheep.  I've also tracked down other dubious connections
92 with McKane Industries."
93    "Thank you Fred. I've read about him--I think I'll have fun with this one."
94 
95    [Farley and Fred were the only ones who heard the previous conversation.
96 Petrov, Joshua, and Fellows only heard hushed whispers.]
97    "All right, Farley--if that's your real name--what do you want with me?"
98 Joshua demanded.
99    Farley changed the subject.  "Does anyone else think it smells like a
100 barnyard in here?"  He smirked at Petrov.
101    Getting even hotter under the collar, Petrov decided it was time to take
102 his leave.  "Uh... I have some business to take care of.  Please lock the door
103 when you -"
104    "Aww, come on.  You can stay and chat a while.  Social intercourse is
105 supposed to come easily... to PETROV!!"  Farley whipped Petrov's hat off, who
106 suddenly felt his world crumbling around him.  He saw Joshua swinging toward
107 him in disbelief.

115   Since my arrival at the Inn about a week ago I've been sitting quietly near
116 the back of the room. I was more than just a little surprised by the attention
117 created by my entry (at the TOP). Thank you Piper. I did dance a little jig to
118 celebrate the occasion. Now that I know something of the flavor of the Inn I
119 am looking forward to my visits here. I have a story, if only work will give
120 me a break, I will get some of it written. For now I have to use the computer
121 at work. Mine is still lost in the great moving fiasco. Hope y'all enjoy it.

140 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (conversations and such)     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
141 FOG Review:   Gee, only a 4.8? My average is better than that! Of course it 
142     does help when you use more than one name around this place. And talking
143     about having more than one, I find it rather odd that the FIVE of mine that
144     were mentioned have a spread from 9+ clear down to my present status...
145     Odd indeed. The remedy to this situation may (almost) be a simple one.
146 CISTOP:   Don't mind me, whenever I'm given the chance to ramble on like that,
147     I will usually jump at it. Then again, my inhabition to enter such an entry
148     was just about non-existant since I knew that it would be going bye-bye in
149     only a few short minutes (VERY bottom of DB). By the way, did anything of
150     what I said make any sense to you, or should I have addressed it to ALL?
151 Prometheus:   When last we were at the Vixen-Mono Corpoation I made the state-
152     ment that "you can write the spy stories well, but you sure don't act 'em,"
153     and them proceeded (sp!?) to turn into the real spy that nobody knew about.
154     (The outfit helped a little bit.) Do you think that before this month is
155     over that we could prehaps infiltrate the establishment once again? (&2+1?)
156 MiG:   I think I noticed a bit of your work laying around without your name on
157     it- am I right or not?      Have you figured out the great 106 caper yet?
158     (snicker-snicker) Maybe if the weather isn't right for you to work this 
159     weekend we might count on seeing you again at the next PorSFiS meeting?
160     If so, then we could discuss those little Japanese models that spit little
161     yellow capsules; could you find the name on it? In english? If not, ...
162 Ian MacHinery:   What's the matter? Too embarassed to enter a response as to
163     the malfunction of your latest toy over Europe?     If at all possible,
164     could you bring a couple extra copies for me as well? Alex shouldn't have
165     to be the only one pulling out hair for no reason/progress!
166 ALL:   If somebody else has already posted an average, I must have missed it.
167     So here it goes...  In reference to that GUNNER FOG listing, there were a
168     total of forty-one (41) entries proccessed, not counting the report itself.
169     With a range of  Piper:12.9 (congrats!)  to  Juggler:2.9 (oops), the 
170     average turned out to be a not so astounding     >>>>> 7.34 <<<<<
171     But then again, I kind of got the idea that only the LAST entry by anyone
172     listed was run through the download program. Needless to mention that quite
173     a few people had been skipped over, and some one-time-entries were included
174     (Knock-out Drops? You mean I can make more than one kind?!?)
175 Well, I guess that about wraps it up for me this time. Remember, conversation
176     IS invited. Stories, doubley so.     Until later, people-

182      The wind was blowing lightly as I put my goggles over my eyes, the
183 scratches in the lens made an interresting start effect against the white
184 lights.  After securing my straps I wasted no time in finding the fall line,
185 the wind was blowing a fine layer of snow over the ice and my edges found
186 something to grab at.  Although moving much more quickly than normal, my
187 turns were clean and controlled, a jump to my right catches my eye, I'm
188 feeling confident enough to GO FOR IT!!
189      The jump had a good lip on it and an excellent slope for landing, as
190 I touch down my skiis feel good. Making a couple of quick turns, I slow and
191 stop, alright!! I got about 10 feet of air!!!  My grin widens as I see another
192 skier try the jump,  comeon... almost.. hey buddy, are you ok?

195   Out of a thick bank of (Gunner) fog, the patrons who care can faintly
196 make out the pipers polysyllabic pontification.
197   "Eschew obfuscation!" he proclamed, letting his proclivity for multisyllabic
198 communications override the incompletely instilled inhibitions toward those
199 same polysyllabic communications constructs.  Taking a deep draubght of the
200 inn's fine ale, he stood up and proclaimed, "Me talk simple now!" sat down,
201 and placed his head firmly on the table and slept.

204   Dan sat on the bed in his rooms.  The man in the inkblot (he really would
205 have to stop thinking of him that way, his closet contained several suits
206 of clothes, all marked in a simpler fashon) had shown Dan the basic layout
207 of the room, then asked him to wait until someone could show him around.
208   "Oh well," he said to himself, "I may as well check my rooms out, at least."
209 During the course of his inspection, he noticed the corner of a sheet of 
210 paper sticking out into an empty drawer.  Pulling it out, he revealed:
211 .......................................................................
212                   IF YOU ARE NEW HERE, YOU ARE IN DANGER!
213 
214   If you have just arrived in this apartment, this note can save your life.
215 You have been recruited by an underground organization.  Do not attempt to
216 leave your room without an escort.  This organization is filled with 
217 fanatics who will  stop at nothing to gain their aims.  I haven't yet found
218 what their purpose i, but news of their existence must be communicated to
219 the NET.  Whoever finds this, please survive and carry the news to the
220 outsi
221 
222 
223 
224 
225 .........................................................................
226   Regarding the note critically, Dan replaced it in the empty drawer.  He
227 had heard of the strange organization called the NET -- and he was not sure
228 that he wanted any association with that group, even on a passing basis.
229 Of course, the note could be a plant.  He really did not know the purpose of
230 this organization either, so the note could be genuine.
231   With a slight shrug, he decided to act with caution (as though the note
232 were true) while still regarding it with skepticism.

273 Ian,
274         I have not really delved into this new version with the usual 
275 zeal...as most of my time is occupied with another *fun* cipher and the 
276 time grows short for its solution. Your addition of characters outside 
277 the bounds of normal text also creates difficulty, as many { MANY } of 
278 my already proven solution techniques do not apply ( at least not yet ). 
279         From the standpoint of my initial work, I find the second code
280 sent far more interesting than the first. However both seem to be singularly
281 unique. I find half factors,partial factors, compound factors and a strange 
282 binary association amongst certain characters. So where does that leave me ?
283 ..for the most part -- out in left field with everyone else. On an intuitive
284 level I feel this smacks of polyalphabetics. 16, 29, 11, 30, 5 and Z, W, X,
285 and D seem to figure prominently during my intermediate calculations...
286 not that would mean much to anyone but me..yet there appears to be a pattern.
287 I would encourage the NET to use this code frequently & often as 435
288 characters in two messages incoded by an obtuse means from the same party
289 is not much to work with. Besides others here have expressed an interest in 
290 solving this unique puzzle. I propose a bounty to the first (non-NET) 
291 patron who solves this.....a pint of Salvator at my expense. 
292 kathy,

328     Down the road a ways, barely in sight of the Rowan tree, a lone figure
329 emerged from the wood and looked around in a dazed sort of fashion. As the
330 practitioner consulted the calendar of the surrounding landscape his mouth
331 fell open in abject surprise. "Why heavens to 'OUROBOROUS'", he exclaimed,
332 "that has to be the longest, involuted, mobius-like time warp transreality
333 manifestation in existence." He was definitely correct in his suppositions
334 having entered the woods sometime in late October and just now emerging. A
335 short stroll in the brisk air brought him to the door of the Inn.  Pausing
336 for a moment to prepare himself, he opened the door just enough to squeeze
337 inside. Ah yes, cozy as ever with many of the regulars occupied with their
338 familiar amusements.  The piper's back was turned so it wasn't possible to
339 determine if he still wore the golden ring around his neck. Well, three or
340 four of the Inn's famous nut-brown ales would loosen any tongue.

358 Jig:  Interesting, a bit deep for me.
359 Piper:  It took me several attempts to waddle thru all of that, boy,
360 now I know that the rating was justified.  I'd give you a good 15.3
361 for that one.  Really, the FOG rating indicates that your writting
362 style is just on an average, the highest of this board.  Your writting
363 is around a Freshman in College, which is not a common reading level
364 since it is thick with large words at times.  This should be taken
365 as a good sign for your writting teachers.  Show this to them.
366 FOGGY PERSON:  How does Piper's last entry compute?
367 Kathy (ythak):  I think that the FOG is a very good indication of the
368 writting abilities of this board.  It indicates the average reading 
369 level that we enjoy to write at (7.3).  Since the FOG has been around
370 for 50 years now, I think it should continue to function on this board.
371 Besides, being on the top or the bottom is not the name of the game, it
372 is just an indications of what level your writting is on.
373 ALL:  My luck is changing, I've been able to call in twice today 
374 instead on just once, and both on the first ring....  Gee Wizzz ...
375 Well, I will see most of you at PorSFiS.  Until we meet again,

379    Mahanta means the Spiritual leader .. Do you really mean:
380    Your Spiritual leader beckons you to 'Return'?
381    Sounds like another JOSHUA to me folks.  And I though Dangerfield was dead?

385 Papa Smuf: Surly you jest! I haven't been able to get on for 4 hours
386 this morning, later today I got on after camping on the line for an
387 hour. and just now, it took 2 hours. Sheesh!
388 Hmm, my writing must have changed, my Fog use to be around 8.5.
389 Of course that was when I was writing a telecommunications column
390 for Compute! a couple of years ago, and not writing fantasy junk.
391 I think the change in style is probably the main difference. Of course,
392 my earlier entries in this system would probably score much lower.
393 The Fog index is a useful tool for writing as long as you don't take
394 it too close to heart. It is far more important to target your writing
395 to your intended audience. The Fog can help direct you in the direction
396 you want, but as all things generated via rules, it only works when
397 the writing fits within the narrow confines of the rules. In the end
398 it is up to you to decide if it is reasonable or not. I used the Fog
399 when I was writing the column because I had to maintain a fairly easy
400 to read article. The main usfulness was is learning sentance strutcture.
401 That is how to properly break apart sentances. Before, I was making
402 them far too long, also being excessivly redundent in how I stated
403 something thus making the sentance overly long there. I was fighting
404 against another problem though, because the column being technical 
405 tends to fight against the Fog index. Thus I ended up having to rely
406 on my own judgement alot. Even then, after a couple of years the whole
407 thing became too much. We finally decided that the thing was just not
408 suited to the direction they were trying to go, so the column was
409 dropped. Wich releived me to no end, as I was getting very tired trying
410 to break techy talk down to 7-8th grade level. Yuk! 
411 As was stated earlier, the Fog doesn't tell you how GOOD the writing is,
412 it only gives you an idea of how the structure is. Take a look at pipers
413 last entry for a good example. The first sentance has a high fog index,
414 and the last one has a low index, and they both are examples of poor
415 writing. It is still up to you to put together the right words to make
416 it readable and interesting.

419     From Prometheus; Awe struck
420     Imagine me looking for some wire in my locker, and rippithe wire from the phone, only to have someone tell me there was
421 a weird note on one of the highest shelves.
422     Perhaps I ought to explain that the wire was to leave inconspicuously hanging from someone else's locker, to prevent them
423 from opening it before we had a chance to clean out the spilled rubber glue, anyway, back to the point...
424     I find a note from Gaudy Minsky left in a place where the locker must have been opened.  Odd, but at least it was a releif
425 from the duldrums of wire splicing.
426 
427     It was really nice, and my attempt at intrigue was foiled too.  Embarrassing, and I do not know how to respond.
428     Anyway, I will try at least, perhaps a visit to the AVCnr (To get cryptic) or a late night pack of lies to a janitor.
429 
430     Man in Gray; That annoying little cretin, Seymour got fired from his job at the Federal Building, I feel kind of sorry for
431 him though.  I mean, for all the information breifs he stole, he still deserved the decency of having the Chinese consolate
432 accept his defection requests.
433     Anyway, some Boulder, Colorado colledge wants to rent out the observatory for a while, I told them yes.  It might be an
434 interesting experience really.  Courtenay never picked up those transmitters, and I still have her receiver.  Interesting.
435     It is a research group doing studies on some gibberish or another but I know it had the word re-entry in it though.
436     So we cn safely assume they are dealing with some observations on launched stuff.  Which could mean anything from ELF to
437 NASASECf to Kastalkin.  Anyway, they must have read up it's qualifications the same way we did, and chose it for essentiAlly
438 the same purpose. Anyway...
439     Sondargaard; Impressive text files, not the tapes but the stuff you did on the manual single data entry generator terminal
440 that PaPa Smurf is loaning to you.  Anyway, sorry for all the twits asking you if you liKe Duran Duran, but those are the draw
441 backs of telephone conversations going on in-between class periods.  Or in a kindergarten through high school program.
442     Gangrenous person; Did some checking, ad you should not do things like that to former shool chums.  And Todd Takach is not
443 pleased with you much either, be carefull of walking alone.  He is really not pleased at you.

506 papa smurf:  Things like "spell check" and "the fog" just tend to make

560 Well, it only took me 2.5 days to get back on this time...  I LIKE the fog/spellcheck stuff. I am the sort of picky
561 person who'd do that myself if not for fear of insulting a fellow boarder. I'm glad to see that all of my characters'
562 writing falls nicely in the middle -- as a long-term college student one of my biggest writing problems has been a
563 tendency to go for a uncomfortably high fog rating. My papers averaged an unreadable 13 before I began writing here,
564 but with long work and little sleep I have been able to bring it down. I am going to try to make it to PC&S this Sat.,
565 hope to see you all there (especially those I've not yet met). Maybe we could do another Trivial Pursuit evening?

572 Gaius had been trailing the Device for days now through the unseasonably foggy Portland streets. He'd almost caught
573 it once, but it took off at high speed and lost him in a used car lot. Damn the engineer that made it to look like
574 a nondescript old VW. Now he had no leads as to where to find... 
575 His thought broke off uncompleted as he spotted something that set his mental alarms ringing. On the sidewalk in
576 front of that motel were small brown pellets...sheep droppings! Here in the heart of the city that could only mean
577 Petrov. The trail led up to the door...  Gaius went in and scouted around. There was no sign on the first floor, but
578 in front of the door to room 23 was another pile, this one badly trampled, as though several people had unwittingly
579 stepped in it. Gaius knew too much about the people he was dealing with to try entering through the door, so he broke
580 into the next room and went out onto the ledge. Carefully he edged around to the window of 23 an peeked in. A bonanza!
581 The room was PACKED with his competitors! If only he'd thought to bring that grenade... Taking a deep breath, he
582 swung the butt of his automatic to meet the windowpane. *CRASH!* Now that he had their attention... "Gentlemen, my
583 men have the door covered. If you would all be so kind as to hand over your weapons..." before anyone could comply,
584 the door crashed in, and there in the doorway was the Device's drone! Gaius wanted no killing while he was present;
585 it was always inconvenient to explain.  "Device! alanna megadodo tump tump tump! Disengage!" The code sequence was
586 part of the device's programming,meant to keep any field agents in its vicinity alive. Unfortunately for Gaius, he 
587 forgot that he wasn't the only one who'd been programming it. The drone faltered for a moment, then turned its laser
588 from Farley to point to where Gaius stood by the window...

593 Ian MacHinery: Nice.  Did you really mean  DDN[]   though? 
594 This is going to take at least a couple of six pacs of cola.
595 I'm a little short, but I thought that Three-Cities deserved some-
596 thing extra for having borroed their little tiny articulated bus
597 for a couple of minutes...  (where did my decoder-ring go to?)
598 
599 Kingman: I know you probably can't do this, but if you can't see
600 if Bruce can. Could you get me a copy of the code lists on paper?
601 One of those printers ought to be able to tie-in  -somehow-   Tnx.
602 kathy: maybe having  -your-  Alex go through the induction wouldn't
603 be such a bad idea seeing as there is already someone else by that
604 name in the "Service" and it would confuse the "emeny" when Ian 
605 would just say "hey, Alex..."  (Wait comrade, I thought you said 
606 Alex was in Moscow...)   This could get interestingly confused!
607                          This could get confusingly interested!
608 NULL: looks like your deterant didn't work. better luck next time.

KR(o)CK (crock?) is dead (did that backspace/correction take?) and now we have
617 
a rare opportunity to give Portland a partially listenable radio
618 tation in the form of the former #1 station in the USA: KGON. If we (that's
619 
us on the net) all start badgering (phoning) them at the office and in the
620 I am having a hard time entering data. The previous was probably lost. If not,
621 ere it is briefly: CALL KGON EVERY DAY and demand that they EXPAND THEIR
622 
PLAYLIST and start playing more variety and HIRE CHRIS BURNS BACK so he can
623 
do the news like the old days. MORE NEW WAVE, DOCTOR DEMENTO and how about
624 
a HARTDCORE PUNK SHOW once a week or more?
