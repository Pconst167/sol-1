20 New BBS!  Olive-Pit BBS, 295-xxxx.  8 am-8pm.  Keep trying, should be up by
21 time you read this.
22 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
23 To all bemoaning the absence of the REPLACE command, bear in mind that
24 the gentleperson responsible has been cordially invited to attend the
25 bi-weekly PorSFiS/BW meeting.  If said person is proud enough to oblige,
26 all of us will have an opportunity to properly show our appreciation.
27 Then we will have no impediments to regaining our beloved REPLACE command.
28 This also gives you hold-outs that extra incentive to attend.
29 Concerning the means of identifying the BWers at PorSFiS, amongst the
30 flourescent headband, pipes, gray clothing, compluter, etc., the means
31 of identifying (oops, I repeated myself, and can't go back and fix it-
32 PLEASE come to the meeting, oh clever 'hacker')
33 anyway, you can tell the :::O O:::voyeur:::O O:: by his lack of
34 identfying marks.  After all, isn't anonymity the mark of the true voyeur?
35 (there are other indications, but I don't want my message deleted by
36 CISTOP)
37 To the parityless man: I hope no 'shocking' situations will prevent
38 your attendance this time?

41   Being basically a rather peaceable typpe, I am beginning to hope that the
42 dread disk eraser does not identify itself.  Although it munged my messages,
43 I almost hesitate to take part in the takeapart party that seems to be 
44 forming in it's (honor? -- that seems a strange word to use here) 
45   Bard -- when one vists the wilds of downtown Portland and finally locates
46 the library building, where does one congregate if one wishes to congregate
47 with those who are there to do so?  In other words does this meeting take
48 place in a special room, the main part of the library, where?  Is it marked?

81 with a minor software problem: What do I do to the UART to get it to output
82 a TRUE break (not a ^C)? I need this to get my modem to hang up!
83 I know it can be done, because my current terminal prog does it! I just

88 ALL Niven fans: While getting some of my collection autographed Thursday, 
89 (WHAT! You didn't know Larry Niven was in town yesterday? See what you missed
90 by not attending the last meeting!) I learned something that will interest
91 many of you. After autographing my copy of "The Mote in God's Eye", Larry
92 flipped thru the book & then WROTE IN A CORRECTION TO A TYPO! The correction 
93 (which TOTALLY changes the meaning of the sentence!) follows:
94 Chapter 50, last line: change "spared" to "spaced"! 
95 ie instead of "The children should have been spared.", it was supposed to be
96 "The children should have been spaced." 
97 Just a MINOR change, right? I don't know which editions have the typo,
98 but I'd check mine if I were you!
99 (I'm beginning to think that ALL publishers are just sending things thru a 
100 DUMB spelling checker & then using underfed chimps as proofreaders!)

102 Starship Unity (words: Anne Passovoy, tune: Johnny Be Fair-Buffy St. Marie)
103 My father is the captain of the starship Unity,
104 And me and mama live on board to bear him company.
105 And I am of the age when I am anxious for to wed;
106 And I must choose a groom who'll win approval from my Dad.
107 
108 Well, Johnny is fine, and Johnny is fair, and wishes me to wed.
109 And I marry Johhny but my father up and said,
110 "I hate to tell you, Daughter, what your mother never knew:
111 That tentacled mess is a son of mine, and so is kin to you."
112 .
113 Well, Jimmy is fine, with shining scales, and sweet as he can be.
114 And I would marry Jimmy, but my father said to me,
115 "I hate to tell you, Daughter, what your mother never knew:
116 That hatchling too is an egg of mine and so is kin to you."
117 
118 Well, Zarin is fine and nine feet tall, and covered with purple hair.
119 And I would marry Zarrin, but my father said, "Beware!
120 I hate to say it, my darlin' girl, but it's the same old tale,
121 And remembering what his mom was like, we're not sure he's a male."
122 
123 Now, Brian is made of light and air, and rather hard to see.
124 At least he doesn't look as if he's any kin to me.
125 I said as much to Father, and he said, "Girl, mind your lip!
126 And never underestimate the captain of a ship."
127 
128 Was ever there a maiden in so sad a fix as this?
129 If all my father says is true, I'll die a single miss.
130 For every man on board is my own brother true --
131 I'll go and find my mother and I'll ask her what to do.
132 
133 "Well, tidy your antennae, girl, and comb your hair so blue.
134 I've taught you that a skipper is a father to his crew.
135 He's doubtless laid each female in the Galaxy, but still
136 He's not the critter that sired you, so marry whom you will!"
137 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~BARD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
138 AS I CROSSED THE FLOOR I LISTENED TO THE JUMBLE OF VOICES AND CLINKING OF
139 GLASSWARE AND SILVER. THEN FROM ACROSS THE ROOM I HEARD THE DRAWLING
140 NASAL VOICE OF THE SPINNER "AH YES, YES INDEED! THEN THERE WAS THE TIME 
141 I WAS CAUGHT UPON THE SURFACE OF GRIMNAL 5. WASN'T SUCH A BAD PLACE TO
142 VISIT SAVE FOR THE CONFOUNDED NATIVES! BIG BRUTES THEY ARE, AND OF THE
143 STRANGEST COLOR I'VE EVER SEEN. ALL BLUE AND FURRY KIND OF LIKE A BLUE
144 GRIZZLY ACTUALLY, BUT INTELLIGENT. WELL, ANY WAY , I WAS WALKING ALONG
145 MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS WHEN OF THESE FELLAS LEAPS OUT THE BUSHES WITH
146 HIS EYES ALL GLAZED AND NOSTRILS ALL FLARED OUT. THINKING I HAD AT LAST
147 FOUND A FOE WORTHY OF MY PUGALISTIC SKILLS I QUICKLY BRANDISHED THE 
148 NEAREST WEAPON I COULD FIND: A LARGE BRANCH OF WOOD WITH A GREAT KNOT ON
149 THE END. I WAVED THE CLUB MENACINGLY ABOVE MY HEAD, PREPARING TO DEAL A
150 BLOW UPON HIS FLAT FURRY TOP WHEN HE FELL TO GROUND SQUEELING IN THEIR
151 NATIVE TONGUE WHICH, ROUGHLY TRANSLATED, MEANS SOME THING ALONG THE LINES
152 OF "HURT ME! PLEASE!! OH HIT ME, BRUISE ME ABOUT THE SHOULDERS!!" I AWS
153 OVERCOME WITH AWE! A MASOCHISTIC, BLUE GRIZZLY BEAR!! NEEDLESS TO SAY,
154 THERE WASN'T MUCH TO EXCEPT WALK AWAY LEAVING THE POOR CRITTER SIMPERING
155 TO HIMSELF." I GRIMACED, THINKING OF THE TIMES I HAD ENDURED HIS TALES OF
156 GREAT PLANETSMANSHIP, BUT THE SPINNER WAS THE ONLY BEING, ALIEN OR OTHER
157 WISE, WHO MIGHT POSSIBLY KNOE THE WAY HOME. I APPROACHED THE TABLE, MY
158 EYES WATCHING THE CROWD, "EXCUSE ME , I BEGAN ..........

236 persist in expressing your anger against him, please leave the innocent
237 users of this board out of your quarrel.  We, in turn, will refrain

239 determine your identity, and there is a remarkably clever group of people

250 Since this disc isn't going anywhere anyway I thought I'd chat 
251 a bit. I went to the "Computers and the Arts" Conference on the
252 second. 
253 
254 Real different being around Art director types but it was a 
255 trip. I only went for the telecommunications presentation. I 
256 wanted to learn more about Dialog and telecomputing in the big
257 leagues. Was an interesting presentation.
258 
259 They had print outs from local BBS's, including Backwater. It's 
260 easy to forget these words get passed around places you wouldn't 
261 suspect. The Apprentice got mentioned by name, as an example 
262 used by the presenter of what kind of names are used on 
263 Backwater. Other than having thirty-five people in the session 
264 with only two computers to demonstrate data-bases, it was 
265 a good conference.
266 
267 Well, I hope this contribution is adequate in keeping this 
268 disc as boring as possible. I wouldn't want to break a streak.

310 Here I am, ready to make my mark on society, and there is nothing to write 
311 about. Not being one to be deterred (I hope I spelled that wrong) by small
312 obstacles, here goes ....
313    My private theory is that our famed defacer is not just one person, but
314 a whole host of troubled high school useres aspiring to be somebody. We talk
315 about the vandal so much that eanyone can figure out what to say to get a 
316 little attention and disk space.
317    And whats this vigilante stuff? a little scary if you ask me. Talking is
318 one thing but... The Ku Klux Klan is the best example of what is wrong with
319 that kind of mentality, ain my opinion at any rate.
320    Worried about the natives to the back of the bus? Simple, just offer them a 
321 large number of anything that looks remotely illicit, and with any luck it
322 will prove fatal. Note: this is not vigilante justice, it is merely a com-
323 munity service. In all fairness, When I am occasionally forced to ride a bus
324 I sit in the back as it affords plenty of free reading material, and some
325 people even accuse me of fitting in.(yeeech).

330 Vigilanteism (sp) in the Backwater Inn?  What is the world coming to?
331 An interesting situation, coming so soon as it does after the discussions
332 of violence on the last 2-3 disks.  Since CISTOP doesn't know the person,
333 I'm inclined to go along with a previous idea - it's just some jerk
334 out to get his jollies.  As in the 'confession' of the PMS sysop.
335 For lack of a better solution, probably the best recourse is to 
336 ignore it until it goes away.  Having been both the teaser and the
337 teasee in my family, I can attest to the fact that if the victim does
338 not respond, the teaser soon loses interest.  In the mean time,
339 grin and bear it.
340 Bard: I also dug up some info on 'true break'.  Tomorrow I
341 will supply you with the code from OMNITERM that does it.
342 Essentially, it resets bit 2 of port EAH (base + 2), kills about a fifth
343 of a second, then sets the bit again.
344 If everyone shows up tomorrow that has indicated they will,
345 we'll have quite a mob there.  I wonder if I will have any luck finding
346 a place to park, since they are having all the Pioneer Square stuff
347 going on this weekend.

372 disk, discussing very little.  Mikey -- not knowing the identity of the
373 persons on here -- how do you know the ladies have all left??  Could tey
374 all have chosen masculine parts for the last few exercises?  Now there is
375 a species of mind-bending lurking that could have some good effects.  I 
376 confess that I actually am a male, but may essay a female persona at some
377 future time.  Perhaps someone rather quiet and demure with a ferocious

384   Since the actions of the self proclaimed "Phantom Hacker" have
385   brought forth a hypothesis or two concerning the 'nature of
386   the beast', here is another based on my observations of it's
387   characteristics on this and other tele-computer systems.
388    (yes SISTOP the plague is widespread to most systems in the
389     local area)
390   The most noticeable character is the attempt make people
391   angry. This leads me to the hypothesis that this is some sort
392   of green silicon slime-fungus from another space time, that has

394   its system was distorted so that it feeds on human emotions.
395   Since one of the strongest of these is anger, it makes attempts
396   to provoke this emotion.
397 
398   Too bad it is not possible to communicate with it and make it
399   aware of the incredible possibilities of this consensual
400   reality it has encountered. If it really is intelligent then
401   it might even be possible to find out how it became damaged
402   in transit and what can be done to effect repair!!!

419 WASN'T THE PERSON WHO MESSED UP YOUR DISK, I JUST DECIDED THAT I WOULD
420 PRETEND TO BE, SO THAT THE REAL PERSON, OUT OF JEALOUSY FOR THE RESPONSE
421 THAT I GOT, WOULD ADMIT TOO THE CRIME. SORRY IT DIDN'T WORK. I PERSONALLY
422 AGREE WITH SOMEONE WHO POSTED A LITTLE ABOVE THAT THE P"PERSON" WAS A GROUP
423 OF TEENAGERS. WELL, GOOD LUCK IN FINDING THEM. THEY PROBABLY WILL
424 TURN UP AGAIN.

427 Leroy: I guess I did mis-understand...A weekend war for recreation is still
428 a little strange to me. Most people I know fight wars to win, with the
429 fun part being a minor to victory. But...I guess you can sell anything
430 to the public these days...Good luck with your enterprises...
431 Bard: It sounds like you are going to get UART info without my help, but
432 only if Aaron is not feeling 'punky' on any given day. You have to watch
433 that guy, he can pull a concealed Gary Neuman tape from his coat at any
434 time, and then...LOOK OUT!
435 Voyeur: I will definitly be there, and as far as parking goes, if I have to
436 go up and park at PSU, I will. I don't know what kind of identifying marks
437 I can carry. I don't have a "J'aime Paris" T-shirt or anything like that,
438 I guess I'll dress up like a normal college student, blue jeans, sweater,
439 and nikes...This will be my first visit, so help me out a little...
440 To vigilanties....It looks like the party is over, at least for awhile.
441 Our own "vandal" (don't use the term hacker, it doesn't fit) was merely
442 trying to make the real culprit confess. A nobel effort at best.
443 Aaron : Bat is around, and he said he might even come to the meeting today.
444 Try coming downtown (it will give you a chance to ride in the back of the
445 bus with your friends - sado nation) and get paid in person...Good luck

448 I am a new user on this system. I work as a Systems Engineer on an HP 3000
449 system at Precision Castparts of Portland.  As a computer professional, I am
450 amazed at tchildishness which I've seen here.  I feel that a BBS is a
451 service to all who use it, and not a playground for babies.  If you want to
452 play, don't take up time and space on a system, go buy or bootleg a new game
453 and play it.  A BBS should be a forum for creativity and a place to meet new
454 people, not a 'Romper-Room'.  It may be that System-supplied passwords are
455 in order, with the user supplying info about who (s)he is and where (s)he
456 lives.  While this at first seems too structured, think for a moment.  The
457 SYSOP (correct spelling) were to call the user's number and find that it was
458 phoney, he could pull the password and deny access to that person.  This 
459 would solve your apparent 'hacking' problem.
460 Please also realize that most teenage computerists are responsible persons
461 who are exploring a new world.  Just because a few are infantile doesn't
462 mean that they are as a class, 'Cretins'.  I am definately not a teenager,
463 but I was one not too long ago, and if I broke into a system, I was careful
464 to never harm or modify another's data.  I urge each of you reading this,
465 as users of a privilege that may be taken away, to remember the above 
466 statements.....

472 DENNIS: THANKS FOR THE CONCERN, BUT UNFORTUNATLY, THE VERY CONCEPT BEHIND
473 BWMS PREVENTS ME FROM IMPLIMENTING SUCH A THING. NOT JUST BECAUSE THE
474 HARDWARE CAN'T SUPPORT IT, BUT BECAUSE THE VERY NATURE OF WHAT BWMS IS
475 PRECLUDES THAT SORT OF THING. AND I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED YET
476 ANOUTHER CBBS/BIT BUCKET/PMS/ECT. TYPE SYSTEM IN THIS TOWN. I OFFER AN
477 ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH. FREEDOM TO SAY WHAT YOU WANT FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT
478 AND NO NEED TO HAVE TO SHOW YOUR IDENTITY TO ANYONE INCLUDING ME. THIS 
479 HAS ALLOWED THE USERS TO HAVE RAGGING DEBATES ON SUBJECTS THAT THEY WOULD
480 NOT NORMALLY TALK ABOUT IF THEIR IDENTITY WERE KNOWN. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
481 IT MEANS THAT YOU CAN GET EXPOSURE TO THE REAL DEEP DOWN DARK THOUGHTS
482 OF PEOPLE THAT THEY NORMALLY WOULD NEVER DARE ALLOW ANYONE ELSE SEE.
483 THIS GIVES THOSE WHO READ THIS MESS A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT
484 THE PEOPLE HERE REALLY THINK AND FEEL, AND HOPEFULLY A BETTER UNDERSTANDING`
485 OF THE WORLD AT LARGE. I WOULD SHUT THE SYSTEM DOWN BEFORE I WOULD 
486 CONSIDER IMPLIMENTING SSUCH A THING. THE ENTER ONLY STRUCTURE SERVES TO
487 PRESERVE THE SYSTEM WHEN NEEDED. WHEN THIS ALL BLOWS OVER AS IT HAS DONE
488 A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE PAST, THE SYSTEM WILL BE RETURNED BACK TO THE
489 NORMAL CONDITION. IT HAS BEEN ONE OF MY CONTINUING AMAZMENTS THAT THE
490 VANDALISM THAT HAS OCCURED HAS BEEN SO MINIMAL, AND EVEN MORE SO THAT
491 THE USERS ARE SO UNDERSTANDING AND TAKE AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN MAINTAINING
492 THE SYSTEM THEMSELVES. IT HAS MADE MY JOB MUCH EASIER.
493                  THANK YOU ALL!

495 P.S. IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING, THE TITLE CISTOP IS A CONTRACTION OF
496 CISTERN OPERATOR. CONSIDERING THE NAME OF THE SYSTEM, THIS SHOULD
497 GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. (THIS IS AS OPPOSED TO
498 'CYST' OPERATOR <AHEM>).
499   OH YES, FORR YOU NEW PEOPLE OUT THERE, THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF A
500 SINGLE BOARD CPU WITH 1K RAM (YES, ONLY 1K!) 8K PROM, USING A 8080
501 PROCESSOR, AND TWO SA400 DISK DRIVES, AND BWMS 'IS' THE OPERATING SYSTEM.

503 Mikey:
504 You referred to the BWMS getting back to 'normal' condition.  Question:
505 Does BWMS >>>>HAVE<<<< a 'normal condition.'  I thought it was permanently
506 abnormal!

510 MIKEY:
511 
512 Thank you for your explanation, it was most enlightening.  I understand that
513 occaisionally individuals get out of hand, and try to spoil something for all.
514 These people are usually frustrated folk who can't get any attention any
515 other way.  I for one enjoy these BBS's (!?) and the opportunity to get
516 bizzare from time to time.  Please don't think that I advocate massive
517 security measures, I just don't feel that the minority should rule all.
518 I like your informal approach to this system, and hope to converse with others
519 in the future.

565 /to cause a reality shift without notifying the affected partiesnot to
566 /mention giving 73 days warning and getting a three-fourths plus one majority), we decided to remind the Piper of th pop

571 /to us and said "something is very wrong here.  I felt a reality shift, but I
572 /didn't do it!"
573 /        Looking about the room, I noted that the furnishings had changed 
574 /slightly, the air smelled of unpleasant chemicals, and the group the Piper

576 /"Innkeeper, what reality is this?".  He looked at me and said "what WHAT?"
577 /"Reality.  Where is this?".  "This is the PC&S Tavern, and I think you've

591 ..high-tech weapons had had no greater result than to allow some
592 of the party to meet Dorothy and a somewhat dubious wizard.
593 In the part...
594 ...test the likelier of the two possiblities first, I attempted to touch
595 my nose with my eyes closed.  Well, my right eye was close enough.
596 "Bard, have you observed...

598 ...PC&S Tavern, and I think you've had enough."  "Alright, but in
599 what reality does this tavern lie?  What plane of existence, what
