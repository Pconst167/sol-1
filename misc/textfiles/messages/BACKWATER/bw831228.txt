8 and operated system which is currently open for use by the general public.
9 No restrictions are placed on the use of the system.
10 It is intended that the system be normally used for messages and

27 You are using the WRONG character to erase mistakes! This system only recognizes
28 CTRL-H (08h) (ASCII backspace) and DEL (7Fh). You are using a tilde (7Eh) this is a 
29 printable character on most terminals. I assume that you are using an ATARI as
30 every time I see someone do this, they have said that they were using one.

34 
35      LEONARD IS RIGHT, I SUSPECT AN ATARI.  I USE AN ATARI, AND THE TILDE
36 DOES INDEED CAUSE A BACKSPACE WHEN USING EITHER JONESTERM OR AMODEM (BOTH
37 PUBLIC DOMAIN PROGRAMS, DEDICATED TO THE PURPOSE OF UPLOAD/DOWNLOAD).  AS
38 TILDE'S GENERATE A BACKSPACE WHEN RECEIVED USING ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS, THE
39 USER MAY THINK THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SEEING THE SAME THING, WHEN ACTUALLY
40 THEY ARE RECEIVING GARBAGE.  SO IF YOU GENTLEMEN WERE TRYING TO BACKSPACE
41 CORRECT AN ERROR DURING ENTRY, USE THE "DELETE/BACK S" KEY OR CONTROL H.
42 BOTH WILL WORK.  IF YOU ARE TRYING FOR SOMETHING FANCY (WRITING A MESSAGE
43 AND THEN ERASING IT), THE TILDE CHARACTER ONLY CAUSES IT ON YOUR MACHINES,
44 AND ONLY FOR THOSE USING THE ABOVE MENTIONED TERMINAL PROGRAMS.  SO YOUR
45 WORK IS LOST ON EVERYONE ELSE.  IF YOU WANT A *GOOD* TERMINAL, YOU MIGHT
46 TRY EITHER THE "CHAMELEON CRT TERMINAL EMULATOR" FROM ATARI PROGRAM EX-
47 CHANGE (WHICH ALLOWS EMULATION OF ADM-3A AND VT-52 TERMINALS) OR ONE OF THE
48 FINE (AND EXPENSIVE) COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS (T.H.E. TERMINAL FROM BINARY SOFT-
49 WARE OR TELE-TALK FROM DATASOFT INC.).  THE PUBLIC DOMAIN PROGRAMS ARE FINE
50 FOR UPLOAD/DOWNLOAD OF ATARI PROGRAMS, BUT LEAVE A GREAT DEAL TO BE DESIRED
51 FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE REST OF THE COMPUTER WORLD.

182 
183 After watching the news tonight, I have some thoughts for the Christmas
184 season, especially concerning charity.  Seeing the homeless, the
185 starving, the unemployed, families without heat, light, food, or
186 anything else that those of us who are more fortunate take for
187 granted, makes me wonder if there is something generally missing in
188 what we we know as the Christmas spirit.
189 
190 I speak of the emphasis on commercialism, on self, of the glitter and
191 glamour that the media would have us believe is the Christmas spirit.
192 I recall also, and most importantly, the many beautiful people who
193 are giving of their time, money, and possesions to those who are
194 in need of help this cold winter.  This year, instead of giving alot
195 of things to your love ones, include a few things, like food or money
196 for heat or rent, to an agency or facility that takes care of the
197 needy.  Or better yet, find a familly or person who needs some help
198 help them.
199 
200 I know this sounds like the same old story you hear from the
201 Salvation Army and from the large charitable organizations, but it is
202 about time that some of us, myself included, realize that there are
203 others in the world who are less fortunate than ourselves right here
204 in our own backyard, that for whatever reasons, need our support as
205 members of the human family and our society in particular.  You can't
206 save the whole world, but helping a small part can sure be rewarding.
207 
208 This message should sit well with any political or religeous
209 persuasion.  Human decency and misery know no bounds or
210 classifications.  For those of you who have doubts about God, in
211 whatever form, this is what it's all about: caring for your fellow
212 beings on this planet we call home.  You want paradise?  By such
213 deeds will you come to know it.
214 
215         Merry Christmas!!!

270 
271      THE ESSENCE OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE ABOVE IS THAT IT WAS EXPECTING YOU
272 TO HAVE KNOWLEGE OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION YOU DIDN'T HAVE.  I HAVE NEVER CALLED
273 THAT PARTICULAR NUMBER, BUT FROM WHAT YOU DESCRIBE, I THINK YOU NEED A PASS-
274 WORD AND AN ASSIGNED JOB NUMBER.  WHAT THIS PROBABLY MEANS IS THAT THEY DO
275 NOT WANT YOU ON THE SYSTEM UNLESS YOU BELONG THERE, AND THEY HAVE TAKEN
276 MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN'T GET ON UNLESS YOU DO BELONG THERE.  IF
277 THAT IS THE CASE, BE AN ETHICAL COMPUTER USER AND STAY OFF THE SYSTEM.  WE
278 HAVE TOO MANY PIRATES AROUND AS IT IS.

280      MIKEY, NOW I HAVE EVEN MORE CRYPTIC COMMANDS TO PONDER OVER!  I SUSPECT
281 THAT I INCLUDED 2 EMPTY LINES (<CR>'S) AND THAT THEY WERE DELETED WHEN YOU
282 USED "COMPRESS".  IS THAT HOW IT WORKS?  FROM NOW ON, I WILL ADD A HEX 0A

288 GLAD TO TELECOMMUNICATE, BUT I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO CLIMB OUT OF MY NICE
289 COZY SHELL.  IT'S WARM (AND SAFE) IN HERE!
290 
291      ARE YOU STILL MONITORING US, d?  I MISS YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!!  YOUR WARM
292 SENSE OF HUMOR AND IMAGINATION ARE NEEDED BY ME AS A COUNTERPOINT TO THE
293 CLASHING EGOS AND FLASHING TEMPERS AMOUNG THE LOUNDER PATRONS.  COULD YOU
294 FAVOR US WITH YOUR PROSE?  PLEASE?
295 
296      HROTHGAR, I NOTICE THAT YOU RARELY COMMENT OVER THE WEEKEND.  DOES THAT
297 MEAN YOU USUALLY USE A MACHINE AT YOUR WORKPLACE FOR YOUR ADDITIONS?  OR DO
298 YOU HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO ON THE WEEKENDS?
299 
300      SO TELL ME, dROPPED bIT, WHICH BIT IS DROPPED?  AND HOW DO YOU THEN
301 COMMUNICATE WITH NO GIBBERISH (OF WORD AS WELL AS THOUGHT)?
302 
303      WELL, I GUESS I BETTER START THINKING OF SOME NEW SUBJECT FOR EVERYONE
304 TO TALK ABOUT.  THINGS ARE GETTING SLOW AROUND HERE AGAIN.

309 PAM...In regards to my bits of dropped, it is simply a name I use
310 to associate myself with the other fine patrons of the Inn. I use it so
311 others will know something about my chosen profession. When I communicate
312 with BWMS, and the other BBS's with my real name, I can mask out the
313 dropped bit(which by the way is the most significant bit) so my 
314 communications are not garbled, and contain some semblence if sense. 
315 My masks off to you for your many thought provoking messages at this
316 Inn. Like I said before, I have saved several of the gems I have found
317 here, and your name appears at the end of more than one of them. Hrothgar
318 and Leonard and Mikey also share their signiture on several of my archived
319 visits here.
320 Yes indeed a new subject is needed. Would people care to comment on
321 the present state of the economy. What are the patrons opinions on
322 inflation rates, interest rates, and the enormous national debt. Does
323 anyone out there dabble in the stock market? What about mutual funds and
324 no-load stock options? I am very interested in discussing money matters,
325 and how they relate to the present condition of the country. I will not
326 however bore people with such messages if the general concensus is NO
327 ECONOMY MESSAGES. And don't think of me as some greedy, material-loving,
328 don't-care-about-people stereotype. I simply want to try and plant the
329 seed for a new and fruitful subject. Does anyone care to join in? After
330 the party I know of several who at least had some opinions on the subject.
331 Any takers?

359 AS FOR THE COMPRESS, YES, THE COMPRESS WAS WHAT DID IT, BUT THE COMPRESS
360 DOES NOT REMOVED BLANK (CR ONLY) LINES, IT ONLY REMOVES DELETED LINES.
361 THUS IF THERE WERE ANY DELETED LINES IN THE TEXT IT MOVES ALL THE LINES
362 UP FOR EACH LINE THAT WAS DELETED.
363 I NORMALLY DON'T RUN THE COMPRESS, BUT I DO EDIT THE DISK TO GET RID OF
364 GARBAGE BEFORE ARCHIVING IT (SUCH AS ^L), AND USED THE COMPRESS JUST
365 TO SEE HOW MUCH WAS DELETED. OH WELL, YOU DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING SINCE

408      The Inn is awash with the young these last few days, their prattle
409 and chatter reminiscent of a flock of itty-bitty birds that sweeps down
410 from nowhere to invade the neighboring trees.  One is always taken by
411 surprise by these noisy feathered creatures--maybe even annoyed--yet 
412 one could take a lesson from their freshness of energy!  Enjoy their
413 strident collective voice(s)--for remember:  the stay is only temporary.
414      Indeed I am a quiet presence here, Pam; realizing how much can be
415 learned from listening, I've chosen a dim corner of the Inn to sip my
416 spiced cider and be patient.  Your kindly invitation warms my heart,
417 though, and I can never resist responding to a sincere request for what
418 I would love dearly to give!  A gracious thanks for your compliments,
419 but tell me:  I thought my ready laughter was unheard by the patrons
420 of the Inn, so where did you gain insight on my sense of humour, Pam?
421      [Innkeeper, I am relieved that you've received at least one of my
422 cries for forgiveness!  Finally my conscience can rest easy!]

425         ----Christmas Eve----
426 
427  Gentle patrons ....... my very best for this holiday season 
428  Your thoughts and opinions voiced over this year have provided many 
429 hours of pleasure. Again many thanks to our host for providing this forum
430 for without it ......the walk through the digital forest would be most vacant.
431 
432     My sincere seasons greetings to all
433 ::::::::::::::Alex::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
434 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
435 WELL NOW!
436 
437 THIS IS THE SECOND MESSAGE I HAVE TO TYPE NOW AS THE POWER WENT OFF HERE FOR
438 JUST A SEC AND I LOST MY FIRST MESSAGE.
439 
440 THE SHAGGY DOG STORY GOT ME A LOT OF MAIL, I'M HAPPY TO SEE. 
441 HERE GOES:
442 
443 DEAR DOCTOR: PLEASE DON'T USE THE CLEAR SCREEN FUNCTION AS IT KEEPS US FROM 
444 READING THE PREVIOUS MESSAGE.
445 PAM: GUESS I JUST NEED THE TTHERAPY VALUE MORE AFTER WORK. THE PAPER 
446 WAS INDEED THE INFAMOUS WILLAMTTE BRIDGE. I ALSO HELPED LATER WITH
447 ADVERTISING AT THE SCRIBE, ALTHOUGH THAT WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT PAPER.
448 AT THE WILLAMETTE BRIDGE I WROTE THE CHESS COLUMN, A COLUMN ON CHILDRENS 
449 GAMES AND RHYMES, AND A 'NEWS IN BRIEF' COLUMN CALLED 'THE RIP OFF NEWS'.
450 THAT WAS MY VERSION OF WORLD PRESS IN REVIEW. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IN
451 MY VERSION WAS THAT I GENERALLY PRECEEDED MY TIDBITS WITH SOMETHING LIKE
452 'WHEN WILL THOSE PIGS IN WASHINGTON EVER LEARN THAT....' ALL I CAN SAY
453 ABOUT THAT NOW FOR AN EXCUSE IS THAT I WAS ONLY NINETEEN AT THE TIME. I
454 SUPPOSE THATS NOT MUCH OF AN EXCUSE TO THOSE HERE WHO ARE 16, BUT SO IT WAS.
455 I GUESS THAT QUALIFIED ME AS A NATTERING NABOB, AT THE VERY LEAST. IT
456 ALSO GOT MY PHONE TAPPED BY THE FBI, ALONG WITH EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE
457 PAPER. ALSO THE OFFICE WAS BUGGED (WE ALL KNEW WHERE IT WAS), AND PERIODICALLY
458 THE COPS WOULD SEND SOMEBODY BY TO TALK TO US DISGUISED AS AN ALBANIAN
459 BOMB-THROWER OR AN ESCAPED RUSSIAN CAPTAIN OF INFANTRY OR A WOBBLY.
460 ALSO THEY SENT IN A FEW WHO WERE A LITTLE HARDER TO SPOT. WE WERE ALL
461 QUITE FASHIONABLY PARANOID ABOUT IT. YOU WERE NO-ONE IN THOSE DAYS IF YOUR
462 PHONE WASN'T TAPPED. THE MAIN THREAT WAS THAT THEY WOULD MISTAKE US 
463 FOR THE WEATHERMEN OR PANTHERS AND DO A RADICAL-TYPE ARREST THERE AT THE 
464 PAPER. ( THIS CONSISTED OF MACHINE GUNNING EVERY ONE IN A PLACE ). 
465 NEVER HAPPENED, THOUGH, OR I WOULDN'T BE HERE TO TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT, 
466 WOULD I. BESIDES BEING INFILTRATED BY THE COPS, WE WERE ALSO INFILTRATED
467 BY THE AMERICAN COMMUNIST PARTY, THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND, AND NOT A FEW OTHERS
468 AS WELL.
469 
470 IT WAS LOADS OF FUN.
471 
472 HAVE READ COMMON SENSE, MANY YEARS AGO. NOT SURE ABOUT THE OTHER ONE.
473 
474 JODY: RIGHT ON. BUT BACK IN WYOMING, WHERE I GOT MY COCKER, WE CALL 'EM
475 CROCKERS. WE ALSO CALL HORSES HOESES. I GOTTA TELL YA WHAT HAPPENED TO
476 MY HOESE SOMETIME.
477 
478 HAPPY HOLIDAYS, ED. DO YOU USE THE GEAR AT CHANNEL 6 TO COMMUNICATE, OR
479 SOMETHING OF YOUR OWN?
480 
481 THANKS MERLYN, CONDOLENCES ACCEPTED.
482 
483 LEONARD : QUITE HARD TO BELIEVE ABOUT SWITZERLAND, A LAND WITH FOUR
484 OFFICIAL LANGUAGES, I BELIEVE, HAVING LAWS ABOUT ACCEPTABLE NAMES. COULD
485 SOMEONE HAVE BEEN PULLING YOUR FRIENDS LEG?
486 
487 GDM: NATASHA DIDN'T KNOW BORIS BATTERNOF, WHICH DISAPPOINTED ME AS BORIS
488 IS A WELL KNOWN FIGURE IN THE WORLD OF SPOOKS. MUST BE THE WRONG NATASHA,
489 NOT THE AQUAINTANCE OF BULLWINKLE AS I THOUGHT.
490 
491 MIKEY THANKS FOR THE ADDRESS
492 
493 AND TO ALL A MERRY CHRISTMAS. INDEED.
494 
495 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HO HO HROTHGAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
496 PAM: UNDER A STACK OF UNREAD MAIL, I FOUND THE FOLLOWING: SCIENCE NEWS,
497 NOVEMBER 12,1983 VOL 124, NO. 20 (PAGES 305-320) TITLED: AFTER NUCLEAR WAR
498 DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD HAVE MISSED THAT! THOUGH IT IS STILL LACKING IN
499 DECENT REFERENCE MATERIAL, IT DOES AT LEAST CONTAIN SOME NUMBERS AND CHARTS
500 AS WELL AS INPUT FROM MORE THEN ONE SOURCE. (3 BASIC SOURCES ONE OF WHICH
501 IS RUSSIAN.) IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, YOU MIGHT POP DOWN TO THE LIBRAY A
502 TAKE A PEEK.
503 d. AHH YES HOT APPLE CIDER JUST THE THING ON A COLD WINTERS DAY.
504 ALEX: THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND WORDS, AND A MERRY DAY TO YOU AS WELL.
505 HROTHGAR: HOPE YOU ENJOY IT! I KNOW I DO. JUST RAN ACROSS A REAL SICK
506 CARTOON. ONE RUSSIAN TALKING TO ANOTHER IN HEAVEN. "BUT WE CAN'T BE DEAD!
507 WE'RE RED!" OK OK I'LL SHUT UP!
508 ALL: LESSION 12B HOW TO FILL YOUR TRUNK WITH SNOW WITHOUT DOING IT YOURSELF.
509 LEAVE THE LID OPEN OVERNIGHT. (MAYBE NEXT TIME I'LL REMEMBER TO CLOSE IT!)
510 *********** CISTOP MIKEY WATCHING THE XMASS SNOWFALL ********************

512 But our power went out 20 minutes ago! (12:10). I'm entering this from my 
513 Model 100. Thank god the TRULY portable machine has arrived! It is a bit 
514 strange entering msgs by candlelight though.

525 YOU. I WISH YOU ALL THE VERY BEST. (IF THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DON'T

537      d, I CAN FEEL THE PRESENCE OF YOUR HUMOR THROUGH YOUR OCCASIONAL RAISED
538 EYEBROW AND THE SLIGHT SMILE, THE SEEMINGLY OFFHAND REMARK THAT CARRIES GREAT-
539 ER WEIGHT THAN IT AT FIRST APPEARS TO.  SUCH AS THIS REQUIRES A DEEPER AND
540 KEENER SENSE OF HUMOR (AND THE ABSURD) THAN MOST, AND ONE MORE SUBTLE THAN I
541 USUALLY DISPLAY.  IT MAY BE THAT WE HERE AT THE INN HAVEN'T FELT THE FULL
542 FORCE OF YOUR WIT, BUT IT PEEKS THROUGH CONSTANTLY, PERHAPS OF ITS OWN VO-
543 LITION.  I WOULD CONTINUE LONGER, BUT I HAVE BEEN THROWN OFF-LINE BY THE
544 WEATHER ONCE ALREADY, AND ONLY THROUGH THE GOOD GRACES OF MIKEY HAVE I BEEN
545 ABLE TO FINISH ENTERING WITHOUT HAVING TO REWRITE THE WHOLE THING.
546 
547 MERRY CHRISTMAS TO EVERYONE!!!!!

604 did I see another message from a Model 100 user up there somewhere? Has
605 someone else discovered the wonders of CMOS?
606 Aaron, I don't personally know any, but sometimes I wonder about some of
607 the people in the CS department who seem to like working on a Honeywell, they
608 must be mystic to get things to go right! C U @ school
