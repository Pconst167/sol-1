22 ... the story teller paused and looked around the Inn. He should at
23     least say hello to the Lady 'C'. (even though her friends here
24     know her by a different calling--certainly he'd not give the game
25     away) After all it was she who gave him the worn chart showing
26     cove near the Inn, where good anchorage was to be found. Oh! Well,
27     he'd go on with the story... perhaps later or much later
28      


Nila's own garden was a very special place, with special
29      treats all about; things to see and hear and touch and
30      smell and taste and think about. It was full of flowers
31      with names like Perfume Delight and Fragrant Hour. It was
32      the most pleasant of places and Nila spent many happy
33      hours there, throughout her whole life both before and
34      after the adventure we are now telling.
35   
36      Nila was idly following the sound of bees, when she
37      suddenly realized that she was hearing music instead.
38      The barely heard music of the finest of strings. As she
39      rounded a hedge, Nila suddenly caught sight of the
40      musician. He was a kindly looking man from the hills
41      dressed in a patched cloak and he was sitting cross-legged
42      under a great Banyan tree, facing south, playing a little
43      stringed instrument that he held in his lap. His eyes
44      were closed and Nila thought that he must be absorbed in
45      the fragile humming sound he played. Though he looked a
46      little rough and unconventional Nila had no fear, even at
47      finding him in her private garden, for she knew that you
48      could hear a man's soul in the music he played and his
49      music was gentle and fine. In fact, remembering the
50      story of the prophesy, Nila had a pretty good idea of
51      who this ragged man might be. Discarding her normal
52      impulse to be polite Nila walked straight up to him and
53      sat down facing him. He neither opened his eyes nor
54      stopped his fingers moving on the strings, which Nila
55      thought a little rude. "Sir", she said politely, "do you
56      know Truth?" The ragged musician opened his eyes and
57      looked at Nila. For a moment Nila thought he had mistaken
58      her for someone else because he looked at her with all the
59      love of a father for a daughter.
60   
61      The strings shimmered beneath his fingers. "Yes", he said.
62      "Can you tell it to me, please?" 
63      "No."
64      The singing bees continued unbroken as though the 
65      conversation were of no import whatever. As Nila pondered
66      she suddenly thought of the line to the song that said,
67                "The answers' in the question, ho!
68      She didn't know quite what that meant but she said, "Sir,
69      am I asking the right questions to learn what I wish to
70      know?"
71      "No.", said the musician and his instrument hummed, "but
72      now your knowing has begun for you know it requires a 
73      proper question to get a proper answer." For a moment
74      Nila felt a little flash of pride that her knowing had 
75      begun. But as she reflected she realized that she was no
76      closer than before to knowing what a proper question was.
77      The more she thought about it the more her mind spun 
78      around and around with all the thousands of questions
79      she could think of to ask. Finally, in the natural
80      course of events she ran out of thinking and said with
81      all her heart, "Please sir, I have thought and thought
82      and thought and I don't know what a proper question 
83      might be. Will you help me please?"
84   
85      "That is the proper question.", the musician said. 
86      Though his fingers ceased to move on the strings, it
87      seemed that his music continued. "Princess", he went on,
88      "You are beautiful beyond your beauty and wise beyond
89      your intelligence, indeed your wisdom surpasses that of
90      scholars for you now know that the answer you get is 
91      contained in the question you ask. I cannot tell you
92      Truth because Truth cannot be told, it can only be
93      experienced."
94 
95      "I see, I think.", said Nila. Her head felt a little
96      strange. "The rule is you only answer the question I ask,
97      so if the question is wrong the answer is wrong too."
98      "Not I alone.", said the musician, "It is the whole
99      world that answers thus. There is a more secret meaning
100      to this as well, which you will realize in the natural
101      course of events."

105 	Since that one group in the corner seems intent on discussing who should be 
106 chosen as the new leader (I assume that is what "president" means) I think I

108 
109 		Burden of the Crown  (words & music: Derek Foster)
110 
111 The battlefield is silent, the shadows growing long.
112 Though I may view the sunset, I'll not live to see the dawn.
113 The trees have ceased to rustle, the birds no longer sing.
114 All nature seems to wonder at the passing of a King.
115 
116 And now you stand before me, your father's flesh and blood,
117 Begotten of my sinews on the woman that I loved.
118 So difficult the birthing, thy mother died that day,
119 And now you stand before me, to bear my crown away.
120 
121 The hour is fast approaching when you come into your own,
122 When you take the ring and sceptre and sit upon the throne.
123 Before that fatal hour, when we each must meet our fate,
124 Pray, gaze upon the royal crown, and marvel at its weight.
125 
126 This cap of burnished metal is the symbol of a land,
127 Supporting all we cherish, the dreams for which we stand.
128 The weight, you'll find, is nothing, if you hold it your hand.
129 The burden of the Crown begins the day you put it on.
130 
131 See how the jewels sparkle, as you gaze on it again.
132 Each facet is a subject, whose rights you must defend.
133 Every point of light a burden you must shoulder with your own.
134 And mighty is the burden of the man upon the throne.
135 
136 The day is nearly ended, my limbs are growing cold.
137 I feel the angels waiting to recieve my passing soul.
138 Keep well for me my kingdom when my memory is dead,
139 And forgive me for the burden I place upon your head.

185      The morning light streams thru the windows of the Inn. There 
186 is  little  activity  as the Innkeeper  busies  himself  cleaning 
187 tables.  Worry on his face for best employee Pam had made mention 
188 of leaving for a long trip the night previously.   Looking across 
189 the  room  he spies Tarn still sleeping at the table  quite  worn 
190 from  the nights activities,  and finds himself a little  envious 
191 for the happiness Tarn appears to have found.   As he is watching 
192 Tarn  stirs,  then  is up.   Rubbing his neck,  for a  crick  had 
193 developed for sleeping in such an odd position through the night, 
194 Tarn  looks  around a bit dazed at first,  then searching  as  if 
195 looking for someone.   He sees the Innkeeper looking at him,  and 
196 returns  a  questioning look in return,  but the  Innkeeper  just 
197 shakes  his  head  no  and  moves  on  about  his  work.   Though 
198 momentarily saddened, the smile quickly returned.
199      Folding  his cloak over his arm for there was no need for it 
200 on such a beautiful day as this!   Tarn strides from the Inn with 
201 a livly stride.   As the Innkeeper watched him go,  he could have 
202 sworn  he  saw Tarn click his heals together in  pure joy  as  he
203 left.  Yes, he was definatly envious of Tarn.
204      Leaving  the  Inn,  Tarn notices a new addition outside  the 
205 Inns  doors,  a Rowan tree had recently been planted by  someone.  
206 Odd  he thinks "I am reminded of something by  that,  but  cannot 
207 think  what."  Then not knowing why he did so,  he breaks a small 
208 twig  from  the tree and puts it through the button hole  in  his 
209 lapel,  and  moves  on down the road in a light stride  that  was 
210 almost a dancing of his feet.
211      The  sun was shining,  and the birds singing in time to  his 
212 light  steps.   A  beautiful spring day in the heart  of  winter.  
213 Yes, it was indeed a glorious day!

241     Is it not enough to have some 19 odd BBS's trying to impress people with 
242 their importance by carrying on learned discussions about ingrown toenails 
243 and the like ?  Why should this board cater to a clientel that has no other 
244 idea of a good time than to quibble amongst themselves. I for one enjoy the 
245 unique atmosphere of this system, and it is indeed a welcome relief from the 
246 clone bulletin boards that some seem to perfer over the originalkity of the 
247 multi author stories we are able to experience here. Yes folks - you could 
248 almost call this art, and that is something some people just cannot relate 
249 too. (there I go... now I'm starting to quibble)

265 A drunken stranger at the back of the crowded common room lurched
266 to his feet and somehow managed to stand on the table.
267 "Someone get him down from there before he starts to..."
268 "I shall now recite from my uncollected works!" The inebriated
269 newcomer's voice somehow carried to every corner of the Inn.
270 "Oh, no!" came a moaned reply from the crowd, as he began to speak:
271 "Thy face is fair to human eye
272 Thy form is song, thy movements light,Thy spirit paen thrown on high
273 The Lord and Angels to delight.
274 Thy voice the murmur of the earth
275 Is, thrilling to the soul of man.
276 Praise heaven for thy day of birth;
277 Such grace could be but by some plan
278 To echo in the earth below 
279 The delights that are above
280 That all who thee percieve should know
281 That there walks one who God does love.
282 and nothing lovely do I see,
283 But being so, reminds of thee."
284 As he finished, the room remained silent for several seconds, until
285 the moment was broken by a ripe tomato striking the poet in the
286 forehead. "Everyone's a critic," he muttered, and sat down to 
287 finish his ale.

291    The piper looked at the bearded journeyman a long moment.  "Yngvi??  Now
292 that name has a familiar ring to it.  It seems that one of that name (obviously
293 not you, you are of a more savory mein) was fed his own toenails on an adventure
294 by Heinlien -- Glory Road?? -- and somewhere before that-------------
295 
296 Pardon me, but I will not write any disrespectful words on the slate.  I have
297 grown older and wish not to change this reality too greatly.  Yngvi, you may
298 have been a louse, but I never dislliked you."
299 
300 Turning away from the stranger the piper pressed the bag flat.  He had collected
301 more moisture in it that was good for the reeds.  The evening had grown ripe,
302 to night, then overripe with the brightning towards dawn.  As he passed the 
303 apprentice --conjuring demons?-- he called 
304    "Gently pleas!e!  James Clerk Maxwell was a Scot and due certain protections
305 --- his demon has been strained by overuse these past 50 years!"
306 
307 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp the piper pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
308 	The apprentice thought for a while, but still could not bring the reference to 
309 mind. He had definitely heard the name before, perhaps in one of the tales of 
310 storm giants? Ah well, no matter.
311 	"Milord piper, I fear that you have Yngvi confused with Igli. Though I must 
312 admit that I do recall something about an Yngvi being a louse..."
313 	He paused, and attempted to look both innocent and hurt. "And as for this talk 
314 of 'Maxwell's demon', I fear that I have no idea what thou art referring to."
315 	At the piper's raised eyebrow he continued in a much lower voice, "Besides,
316 milord, I merely used his name in the invocation. I did not summon that creature
317 thou hast spoken of."
318 	Louder, "Farewell, piper"

321       The Inspector had just a moment to see that sword raised for the
322 final stroke when the sound of a gunshot and broken glass pierced the
323 room.  For a moment, he could not comprehend what was happening, when
324 the ninja slowly crumbled into a heap on the floor, as if all of the
325 air had been let out suddenly.  Salizar lay on the floor, panting and
326 regaining his wits for a moment, and then managed to sit up against the
327 sofa.  The tall stranger was sitting up, having pulled the daggers out 
328 of his arms, and was trying to examine Serena, the blood flowing 
329 unstaunched from his woulds.  The sound of rapid footsteps from the hall
330 produced a dwarf, carrying a rifle.  
331 	     The man's ministrations seemed to have an effect, as Serena opened
332 her eyes.  The dwarf stepped over her in the entranceway and went to
333 examine the ninja.  "Sergei?" She whispered.  "How..."
334      "I escaped from McKane in Argentina two days ago, and have been
335 searching for you ever since, dear Serena. I killed four of the
336 dogs, but McKane has again escaped me.  It is clear I have arrived nono
337 too early."
338      Serena sat up, rubbing her head.  "I was struck from behind.  Verry
339 clumsy of me."  and then she saw Salizar.  "Inspector!  What's happened?
340 Who is..."
341      Phillipe interjected "It's the Ninja.  Valerius sent me to watch over
342 the Inspector, and I had the room in my rifle scope from across the
343 street.  Look!"  As he pulled what was obviously the shift lever from
344 a Chevy from the figure's bag iof implements.
345      The inspector, finally roused from action, said "Give me that! So
346 we know who killed Natasha, but why?"
347      Sergei rolled the figure over with the toe of his boot, the dull
348 lifeless eyes of the ninja stared at the ceiling.  "We may never know..."
349      The sound of sirens approaching galvanized them into action.  The
350 dwarf dropped the rifle, and Serena helped Sergei out of the room.  
351 Only the Inspector was left, holding the shift lever gently in his
352 hands, left to ponder what had happened.  The case may be closed, but
353 for the Inspector, it could never be over.

356 TO EVAN and others involved in the McKane saga:
357      It seemed time to tie up some loose ends.  Evan:  A multi-
358 author story is just that.  Read what has come before, and think
359 up some CONSISTANT continuation to the plot and have at it.  It
360 helps to leave some piece of possibly related data around for others
361 to pick up on.  It is also almost a necessity to log in every day,
362 no matter how hard it is, or you get passed by, or killed as in
363 the case of our poor Ninja, of whom we have not heard fror some time.

378 GENERAL MACAIBO:
379 "Organizing, funding, and completing a lunar mining station" 
380 sounds like a practical endeavor to me. It's a big project, I 
381 must admit, but one I would think could be broken into 
382 managable parts.
383 
384 Given enough time, determination, and savvy I figure you'll 
385 probably pull it off. Though probably not in the way you 
386 originally intended.
387 
388 By the way. What is the "best education" for the person 
389 preparing for lunar construction? Organizing, funding, and 
390 building represent three separate career skills. Are you 
391 preparing yourself in all three areas?
392 
393 Is a college education a help or hindrance in such a 
394 pioneering career choice?
395 
396 No doubt about it. I think your lunar mining camp is a good 
397 idea. I'm curious about your specific strategy for pulling 
398 it off.
399 ==================
400 Leonard:
401 You hit it on the head with Rule #1. I'd only add that I'd 
402 include everyone...not just kids.
403 
404 I find I get better result from people if I treat them with 
405 respect. It's usually better to talk across to someone than 
406 down to them. 
407 
408 That was my secret for getting the mentally ill people to 
409 produce the television series. I treated them with respect. 
410 I treated them as equals. They responded to it and produced 
411 something the "experts" would have believed impossible. 
412 
413 Yes, I think you've hit on a sound principle there. One that
414 usually works.
415 
416 I'm not as excited by your idea that children become
417 logical because their parents confuse them...though I admit 
418 my parents certainly confused me. 
419 
420 I think there's a biological reason for children to become 
421 less logical. Young children have to be logical because the 
422 part of their brain that understands abstractions isn't mature 
423 yet. Once able to understand abstractions their thinking 
424 appears confused because logic no longer always works.
425 
426 That works out, though, because it's a confusing world and 
427 being confused is probably the right thing to do anyway. At 
428 least it's always worked for me.

436 Hi!
437    This is the Ninja. It shure doesn't feel good to be dead
438 Anyway, I would like to say that my friend is willing to buy
439 some of the resources from the little lunar mining operation.
440 You see, we are going to get lots of aluminium and drop it on
441 Venus. When this reacts with the hydrochloric acid to form 
442 hydrogen, we will try to find some oxygen (from asteroids?)
443 and torch it. This will solve the hydrochloric acid problem
444 and form life giving water.

468 I WONDER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO PAM? SHE SEEMS TO BE NOTICIBLY
469 MISSING OF LATE. ODD..

471 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
472 Apprentice:  I think your're right, it was Igli.  My memory seems to be getting
473 worse by the moment.
474 Bard:  Since no one has jumped on it, I suspect that Backwater is physically
475 located in Oregon City.
476 Which SCA country is that?
477 Cistop Mikey:  Am I right about location?
478 
479 The piper felt exhaustion weighting him down.  The quantities of ale he had
480 drunk were nearly sloshing in his stomach -- not uncumfortably so, just letting
481 him know that it was there.
482  
483 Somehow the long evening seemed over.  With a wave and smile of thanks, the 
484 piper slung his pipes under his arm and made his way out of the inn's common
485 room.  Feeling his way down a dimly lit hallway, he went into a small room
486 and sank down uncouncious on a hard bed.
487 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

514 Merddin Emrys:
515 
516 Well it's about time somebody wrote something that made some 
517 sense. Good job.
518 
519 Of course we are "bound to illusion of reality as long as we 
520 can not see past the big gulp". That's the whole point. It's 
521 the gulp that makes primal belch therapy the means to liberate 
522 mankind from existential phenomenalism.
523 
524 Scientists have discovered that spiritual malady is caused by 
525 gasses within the body seeking to excape.
526 
527 Primal belch therapy is a technique for liberating those 
528 fumes. The primal belch, in releasing pent up negative Ion 
529 gasses, catapults the patient into a free form existential 
530 spiritual experience.
531 
532 The procedure is also good for acne.
533 
534 If you'd like to know more about this scientific break-through 
535 please send me eight hundred thousand dollars in small bills. 
536 Place your payment in brown paper bags and deliver them to 
537 Lt. Salazar. He'll know what to do with the money.
538 
539 If we are all merely fingers on the hand of life, then I, I 
540 imagine, am the thumb.

544 ======================
546 Andy Rooney:
548 Military scientists working for the phone company made a 
549 remarkable discovery. They found that a computer enhanced 
550 low D tone made people unusually suseptible to post hypnotic 
551 suggestion.
552 
553 The tone you hear on you phone is transmitting a message to 
554 your subconscience telling it to believe what it is about to 
555 hear. The inverted Bd is the propoganda material being 
556 programmed, subconsiously of course, into your brain.
557 
558 You doubt this?
560 Remember last Thursday when you almost got run over by that 
561 M-60 tank in the Safeway parking lot? During that whole 
562 episode did it ever occur to you that a tank in the Safeway 
563 parking lot was at all unusual? I didn't think so. 
564 
565 In future phone encounters I recommend placing a bed mattress 
566 (preferably King size) between your head and the receiver. If 
567 this fails try having wax surgically emplanted in your left 
568 ear.

575 My dearest Mohammed:
576      You will be pleased to know that the Ninja finally bit the big one.
577 Salazar is safe but thoroughly baffled.  I'll be taking a few days off
578 with Sergei, Philippe, and a platypus named Herman.  I think I deserve the
579 rest, don't you?  The trip to Venice will have to be put on hold for a 
580 while(I hate canals anyway).  Leroy is into something called primal belch
581 therapy, I think all this cloak and dagger stuff has affected his brain
582 (or stomach).  Take care big fellow.

589       My friend Tarn has been in such good spirits of  late  that  it  is
590 hard for me to remember that he can suddenly  turn  morose  and  cynical.
591 From the window of my rented room at the Inn, I can see  the  road  which
592 passes over a small footbridge and extends about a mile before  making  a
593 sharp bend and dissapearing from  view  in  the  almost  primevil  forest
594 that carpets the land, and I am reminded that  Tarn  is  much  like  that
595 forest.  There is much beauty, if only one  cares  to  look,  but  it  is
596 untamed and wild.  On days like today, when the air is cold and  the  sky
597 is blanketed with gray, the forest appears to brood.  I  hope  that  Tarn
598 does not emulate the  forest  in  that  manner  also,  for  I  enjoy  his
599 presence much when he is jolly, but I am disturbed when  he  is  deep  in
600 the pool of his own memories.
601       Walking downstairs, I am once  again  surprised  to  see  that  the
602 Innkeeper is alone at his tasks, with help nowhere to  be  found.   Where
603 is his barmaid?  He seems unconcerned, though, so it isn't  my  place  to
604 question.  Ah well, I'll break my fast, and wait to see if Tarn  will  be
605 in today.

613 GOLLY, DRIVE A IS ALL FULL AND THERE IS STILL ROOM
614 ON DRIVE B! YOU PEOPLE SURE ARE SLOW! I HAD HEARD
615 THAT SOMEONE CALL PAM USUALLY CLEANED OFF THIS 
616 TABLE, BUT I DON'T SEE IT BEING CLEANED, AND WITH
617 TABLES HERE IN THE INN BEING IN SUCH SHORT SUPPLY
618 I FIND THAT I HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP MYSELF IF I WANT
619 TO USE IT. WHERE IS THE INN KEEPER? WHERE IS MY 
620 DIRNK?! COME ON I WANT SOME SERVICE HERE! WHAT KIND
621 OF A SLOP HOUSE ARE YOU RUNNING HERE ANYWAY?! 
622  EIIEEEE...  * CRASH *   < TINKLE >   - THUD -   "DAMN!!"
623 I GUESS I SHOULDN'T HAVE STOOD ON THE TABLE. (OF 
624 COURSE THE JUMPING UP AND DOWN PROBABLY DIDN'T 
625 HELP A LOT EITHER.) I WONDER IF MIKEY WILL MAKE
626 ME PAY FOR THE DAMAGES. MAYBE I CAN SUE HIM FOR 
627 THE MONEY TO PAY 'EM. "WIPLASH!!!"
