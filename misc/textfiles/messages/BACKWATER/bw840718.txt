21      Looking down at the cozy valley below, it seemed very 
22 familiar.  I wonder why that should be, for I have not to my 
23 recollection been in this land before.  Ah well, no matter.  
24      I notice a bit of smoke lazily curling up from an old 
25 building sitting beside a small stream that twinkled and 
26 glittered in the warm afternoon sun.  Hmm, habitation.  Perhaps 
27 I can find lodging there for a bit.  Taking my rumpled hat off 
28 to let the gentle breeze cool me off a bit, I wipe the 
29 accumulated dust and perspiration from my brow. Then donning it 
30 once more, I set off towards the tell-tale column of smoke.
31      Soon the sparse scraggly growth has been replaced by 
32 towering firs and majestic oak, and I find myself deep within a 
33 dark forest that closes in over my head.  No longer able to see 
34 the gray smoke rising like a twisted steel column, I must rely 
35 on my own innate sense of direction to guide me.  
36      I find myself in a dilemma however as the forest becomes 
37 nearly impassible as it snatches at me leaving sticky trails 
38 across my skin and brambles in clothes.  I must turn to the 
39 north where it does not grow so thick and I will have a better 
40 chance of finding a path.  I only hope I don't lose my way 
41 completely.
42      Finally after a long and tedious trek, I come upon a small 
43 stream winding through the forest heading west.  Ah ha, at 
44 last, I do believe that this is the stream I observed passing 
45 near the building, all I need do is follow it now, and I should 
46 find it. 
47      Following along side of the stream, I find the going much 
48 easier then had been through the forest.  Near an outcroping of 
49 rock I see some footprints.  So!, someone else has followed 
50 this trail too.  Near each right foot is a small depression 
51 probably made by a walking stick.  Perhaps I will meet this 
52 individual, it is always nice to meet a fellow traveler.
53      Then, up ahead, a small foot bridge.  At last a real road! 
54 Climbing up the crumbling bank, I reach the end of the well 
55 worn span, and looking across I see my destination, the 
56 building with the smoke ever rising from the stone chimney.  
57 Setting out across the bridge, I head towards the building.  As 
58 I approach, I see that it is a Inn.  So, Indeed I will be able 
59 to obtain lodging here.  A pleasent prospect to be sure.  
60 Nearing the Inn, I spy a Rowan tree by the entrance.  Very odd, 
61 that is definitely not a normal tree to encounter in these 
62 parts, someone obviously has planted it here.  I wonder who has 
63 done this and what their purpose for doing so was.  Perhaps 
64 someone at this Inn will know of its story.
65      Looking up at the sign, I see the name of this meager 
66 establishment; 'Backwater Inn', Hmm, suitable name that's for 
67 sure.  Stepping up to the entrance, I grasp the worn brass knob 
68 and open the door.  I know this place, I am sure of it, I just 
69 don't know from where.  Very strange.

78 Alex:I too wish to thank you and your wife for being such fine hosts for the
79      Risk Game. It was very enjoyable, and I too think our group proved to
80      mesh quite well considering this is the first time we had risked playing
81      together. Thank you also for the Nuclear Risk instructions. I was going
82      to give you a call and ask for a file xfer, but you have saved me the
83      trouble. I have already interested some other riskers in the option.
84      I have not found the white pieces yet, but I will keep on looking. One
85      question...is the extra path to Aussie land necessary. What have you
86      found?
87 Anti-Nuke Protesters: In our game of Nuclear Risk, it was proven that the
88      dominating force doesn't necessarily need to be the one using the
89      his or her nuclear resource. Just let the other little countries use
90      their weapons to destroy each other, and then sweep onward to total
91      global domination. So there will be a few dirty sections on the globe,
92      but hey, that's where you can send the criminals! Remember, the only
93      good nuke is a nuke heading to your enemy's silo site.
94 Mikey:We have 3/5ths of the money in one location. Well...I tried... I'll
95       give you a call at US D. when I have the whole amount.

99 Alex I'd like to add my thanks for the hosting of the Risk game. Sorry
100 I couldn't stay for the nuclear version. Thanks also for the rules you 
101 posted. I hard copied them and will stick them in with one of my sets.

104 Hunter sat quietly in the comfortable chair back of McKanes desk. It had been
105 8 hours now and he expected that soon the office crew would start arriving,
106 followed not too much later he hoped by McKane himself. It would be nice to
107 see the guy again. It had been ten years since he and McKane had broken
108 out of that Albanian jail and skipped the country carrying twenty million
109 in cash. He wondered whether McKane had any WORK that he wanted done.

112    The piper was sitting alone at a table off to one  side of the common room.
113 He had disassembled his pipes on the table, and had been working for some time
114 around a nearly full mug of the inn's best ale.  Intent on wrapping hempen
115 cord around the base of one of his drones, he nearly knoked the mug over with
116 a move of his arm, muttered something quietly under his breath, and paused for
117 a moment.  He quickly drank the ale in the mug, then began assembling his pipes.
118    Just as he finished, the door began to open -- the person entering was 
119 greeted by the painful sound of the untuned pipes.  Apologetically, the pipr
120 quickly tuned the drones, than swung into a few sprightly dance tunes to 
121 welcome another stranger.

131      When I decided to make my relationships with young 
132 boys open to discussion I anticipated that you'd respond the 
133 way you did...with anger, verbal abuse, and denial. I had 
134 hoped to receive at least one intelligent response but was 
135 disappointed. 
136      Apparently you people lack the sophistication to discuss 
137 complex issues intelligently. None-the-less, I promised I'd 
138 respond and I will.
139      Alex - What do you see as the alternative to 
140 "hypocritically facing society under a facade of normalacy" 
141 when honesty creates the kinds of abuse I've received at 
142 Backwater? I am what I am. I can admit it and be persecuted 
143 or keep quiet and live my life. What would you do in my shoes? 
144      It's interesting that the wording of the abuse I've 
145 received here is EXACTLY the same as that used against 
146 homosexuals ten years ago. Homosexuality is now accepted 
147 because the gay community became organized, politicized, and 
148 learned the techniques for "educating" the public. 
149      The reason adult/child love is still hated, as homosexual 
150 love once was, is because we haven't come out of the closet in 
151 enough numbers to have an impact. If, as the experts say, one 
152 in four children has had sexual contact with an adult then 
153 there must be an awful lot of us.
154      Someday, learning from the experience of the homosexuals, 
155 we will come out in enough force to take our stand. Then we 
156 will "educate" you so well that you will tolerate us as you 
157 now tolerate those you once hated as "fags".
158      As to your assumptions about the "natural tenents of 
159 sexual development", you don't know what your talking about. 
160 You imply that you have scientific evidence that your way is 
161 the right way, but in fact no such evidence exists. If I am 
162 wrong, produce it.
163      I agree that "if it feels good, do it" is the worst 
164 rationalization for perversity around. However, I neither said 
165 or implied that. You made it up, then quoted me as saying it. 
166 This leads me to believe that you are either intellectually 
167 unsophisticated or immature.
168      GUEST - Where did you "study the habits of pedophiles", 
169 who did you study under, and why? Perhaps we have more in 
170 common than you admit.
171      Does it give you a sense of superiority to tack the 
172 clinical terminology of pedophilia on me? Using clinical 
173 jargon to label alternative lifestyles as sick is a strategy 
174 that was used very effectively to persecute homosexuals.
175      Oddly enough, when homosexuals developed political clout 
176 the American Psychiatric Association suddenly discovered that 
177 they weren't sick at all. That it was all a big misunder-
178 standing and that it was an alternative lifestyle after all. 
179 The same will eventually be true for "pedophiles".
180      Who knows, maybe someday we'll even have a pedophile 
181 pride day, complete with parade and political speeches.
182      Had you "studied pedophilia" more closely you wouldn't 
183 find it unusual we're attracted to where the boys are. Boy 
184 Scout camps, video archades, church groups, are all good 
185 places to make friends. 
186      Just to set the record straight. I didn't say my boys 
187 initiated the relationship. I said that once the relationship 
188 was going they initiated sex. It's a difference you would have 
189 caught if you were paying more attention to my words and less 
190 to your emotions.
191      TO EVERYONE - OK gang, you guys are always bitching 
192 because there's never a good debate. Well, you wouldn't know 
193 a good debate if it smacked you in the face.
194      You want your discussions safe, and clean, and wholesome. 
195 You want pat answers and easy solutions to problems you don't 
196 begin to understand. You want to pontificate, to be self 
197 righteous, to show off your fancy educations so long as no one 
198 requires you to THINK.
199      Well that's not good enough. This is a tough issue that 
200 requires intelligence, compassion, understanding, and clear 
201 thinking...qualities you haven't shown so far.
202      Since this is an issue that hasn't hit the popular press 
203 you can't fall back on plagarizing the editorial page of the 
204 Oregonian. This one will require some original thought, 
205 that's assuming, of course, that your fancy educations haven't 
206 totally destroyed your ability to think.

212    The piper stopped playing for a few moments, thought briefly,
213 then decided to risk a reply.
214    "Frank -- I appreciate your attempting to initiate a dialog.  However,
215 I find it hard to sympathize with your position.  Perhaps I am conditioned
216 by my social background such that I have difficulty in relating to
217 alternative life styles, but feel that I must point out several things.
218   (1)  Pedophilia is illegal.  If you feel that that illegality is unjust,
219        then you can emulate Thoreau and say from the comfort of a cell,
220        "the place for a just man is in prison."
221   (2)  You can attempt to change those laws that you feel are unjust.  If
222        indeed, this is your aim -- it is laudable, but I will oppose you
223        with every means that I have available.  
224   (3)  You can suppress those impulses that society finds unlawful.
225   (4)  You can indulge with the concomittant possibility of being caught.
226 
227 You must make your own decisions -- neither I nor anyone else will
228 make them for you.  I can only make my decisions as to my reaction if
229 your actions impinge upon my life.  If they do -- I then must make a
230 moral decision as to my actions.  Not having faced the problem, I cannot
231 tell you how I would react if you approached one of my children.
232 I suspect that the reaction would not be pacific, however.  By extension,
233 I would oppose changing the laws to make your actions legal.  However,
234 my reactions to your activity as they relate to my children would be
235 apart from, although taking into account, existing laws.
236   On the same vein, should you murder one of my children (another act
237 regarded with disdain by our society that I have considered) my reaction
238 would be -- perhaps not swift -- but would preclude the repition of
239 that act.  I would kill you in cold blood.  I will give some thought to
240 my reactions to your other actions.  
241    --the piper
242 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

244 \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/
245 FRANK: using the 'acceptance' of homosexuality as a basis for the acceptance
246 of your perversion is like comparing feces with shit.
247 'Normal', you say?  From an evolutionary standpoint, both homosexuality
248 and pedophilia (since the word has already been introduced) are
249 counter-productive.  Nature doesn't stay with counter-productive experiments
250 Much as homosexuality disgusts me, what you engage in is worse.  At least
251 homosexuality is between consenting adults, whose psyches have already
252 been formed.  Children, on the other hand, are still learning and being
253 shaped.  Your type of interaction can have nothing but a detrimental affect
254 on their minds.  To paraphrase what piper said, if I catch you messing 
255 with my children I'll blow your nuts off and face the music with a smile.
256 P.S.  I myself prefer the fanstasy/adventure aspect of Backwater to this
257 futile arguing.

269  
270 Riskers,
271         The pleasure was all ours..... even my wife thought we were well 
272 behaved ....( no easy feat for a Risk game in her eyes ) ...The conversation
273 was good, the synergy better and the company superb...my complements to you.
274 We must repeat this in the near future. 
275 Whisper, 
276         Too bad you had to leave before the second game. You might of been
277 able to contain L'homme....lord knows I was no threat...just your basic
278 glowing cinder...after the first move...compements of MiG - The Destroyer.
279 L'homme,
280         The second path to Australia is not required..but I have found that
281 it is more than probable that the crossover points ( Iceland-Greenland , 
282 Kamchatka-Alaska etc. ) will get hit...and even more probable that Siam or
283 Indonesia will bear the brunt of some attack .. so to avoid the mexican
284 standoff that develops from such an attack the second path was made.
285 In the worst case ( under current rules ) if Siam was took two Nukes nobody
286 would be able to cross....so to avoid draws...the second path was made.
287         As for Four and Five, current indications place them out of postition
288 but keep trying.....you only have 50$ to go.....by the way whats connected
289 to the other end of that number ?...I have not tried it yet ?
290 ......A small 10 character key...eh...

326 I haven't been on BW for quite a while. This Frank character seems to
327 have ruffled everyone.
328 Frank:  I don't accept homosexuals. I feel that homosexuality IS a mental
329 disorder. I recently spent some time with a relative who lives in Kuwait
330 and we disussed at length the subject from an Arabic perspective.
331 He said that whenever a man is pushed to be overly macho, mental
332 problems arise. The female portion of a man feels suppressed and tries to
333 express its(her)self in homosexualtity. The Kuwaiti's used to have trouble
334 with homosexuality. It is now illegal. 
335 Homosexuality is a mental disorder caused by society's pressures
336 put on a man. Pedophilia occurs in someone whose mind has really become
337 warped. Pressures and problems with relationships and jobs may leave a
338 person longing for his days of childhood. Perhaps a pedophilia's mind
339 has become warped to the place where sexual intimicy with children helps
340 to fill this void.

365 Frank:stick around, it may be a few days.
366 NET7:he can, oh yes he can. The code that the net is currently using is some
367 what vulnerable. t appears that I was wrong and perhaps we should have let
368 NET1 talk for about 10 more miniuts, well, how about 5 more miniuts?
369 Well all, Le Nerd is slowly going under entropy I.E. Michael hasn't writen 
370 a single line of code the last 2 days.
371 That does not bother me .5 as much as the fact that my ex-wife has returned 
372 from washington D.C. and is currently partying with Michael,2 of my best 
373 female friends and the people who grow my dope. I am somewhat wondering what
374 will become of this...

384   Frank - I usually try not to answer any of these provococations, because I
385 prefer the fantasy aspect of this board, and I hope that I no one answers to
386 your outbursts, you will away.  No such lucj in your case, so I must say my
387 ten cents worth.
388   I, being of an inbetween age ( know the cat is out of the bag ), I have
389 no children to protect, yet I am by no means a child, at least by my
390 perspective.  Yet, I would react quite viiolently to any actions against
391 my children, provided I had any.  Furthermore, I am glad that you have not
392 altered my personality by contact in my younger years ( I happen to like
393 the way I am now ).  You may be taking satisfaction in our threats, but
394 you must realize that they are not in vain, and whether or not our actions
395 would be illegal ( as yours certainly are ) , we would almost certainly
396 be doing society in general a favor with your extermination.  I cannot
397 accept a  " alternate lifestyle " that may harm this countries youth, which
398 are our greatest resource.  Do yourself, and moreover the children a good
399 turn by seeking profesional help...
400   To all - you may now start guessing my age.

404 Frank: You say that 1 in 4 children have had a sexual experience with an
405 adult. It seemed to me that you were using that in a way to justify your
406 sexual orientation. I tend to believe that you may be reasonably accurate
407 in your estimate (lacking any written statistics I will at least accept
408 it as a working parameter). I know several people who were involved in
409 one form or another of child/adult sex. Without exception this experience
410 has warped their ability to engage in any form of normal relationships
411 with their peers. All of them are struggling with emotional disabilities
412 as a result of being subjected to this kind of relationship in their 
413 formative years. Given that this is true. And I can only judge by the
414 results I have heard about. I feel that you are ignoring the effect you 
415 have on these childrens future. If this does not bother you then regardless
416 of what your orientation is, I would like to see you committed to some
417 place where you can receive appropriate mental counseling. In other words
418 your sexual orientation doesn't bother me its what you do to others that
419 will have a lasting bad effect on their minds that bothers me.

425 Lord Morby: WE couldn't give a crap how old you are. Mental age is the pointer
426 we like to use anyway.
427 Frank: Who says society has accepted homosexuals? I guess you have missed all
428 the occurances of fag bashing listed in several big city newspapers, or the
429 comments from people who are asked their opinion on the subject. Their
430 answers usually revolve around death or dismemberent. As to your problem, you
431 can see the general consensus of opinion. Not a pretty sight? Well neither
432 are you. It's debate we want, not sickness, not perversness, and certainly
433 not you!
434 MIG:As young as you are and you already have an ex-wife? What goes on here?
435 But if this michael is running around with 3 women, and people who grow dope,
436 I can certainly understand why he hasn't done much coding lately.

442     Morby, This system does not revolve around you.   First you want
443            sympathy because you were going away, then becuase you were
444            back.    And then you wanted everybody to guess who you were
445            because you kept repeating your messages and wouldn't leave
446            your name, and now, now you want everyone to guess your age.
447            WHO CARES comes to mind right of the bat, and not to mention
448            WHY?   Why do you want everyone to recognize that you, and
449            say "what a GREAT guy, he's somebody! WOW!" and much more 
450            than that.   Also, why do you think you can give everybody

489 M(n'ettg)iG: perhaps we should start a club for those who life has dumped
490 on.  We can be charter members.  Besides the personal problems I also
491 have experienced in the recent past, my house was foreclosed a couple of
492 months ago, and just last weekend I received a letter from PGE claiming I
493 owe them $2225 for weatherization on the house I no longer own.
494 Now, as $2225 is about $11,000 more than I have, I detect a problem.
495 Deducting it from my $0/month income is going to take a while to pay off,
496 too.  Since your supplier is otherwise occupied, I suppose I can't even
497 come over and get stoned in your closet while recording dazzling
498 conversation for posterity.

502 ALL ARCHIVE (or interested): Want printed version? Currently investigating
503 two types, impact and laser. As for "non-group buy" people wanting copies
504 in print; speak up now, or forever endure the hassle of tracking down the
505 group members to try to re-split your contribution. If you are currently in
506 on the buy and want a printed version lemme know ASAP as I have to determin
507 how much paper and ink and all that good stuff band printers use that we 
508 will need so I can figgure out the cost. Should be inexpensive, just cost
509 of paper and ribbons....                                   Aaron
510 PS: actually, the laser printing isn't quite that simple, as I don't own
511 a laser printer. But, if you are wanting to bind or otherwise show off
512 your spiffy backwater backlogs, laser printing may be for you. Cost is appx.
513  $0.08/page compared to $0.02/page for conventional printing.
514 PPS: if you opt for the impact (which I will do here); you should be able to
515 get them the day after I recieve the disks, we have a very fast printer.....

522    Well, it looks like Frank, if he is for real, has a number of honest answers.  
523 I for one can sympathize with his problem, but am unwilling to tolerate any
524 expression of his "life-style."  Homo-sex, between consenting adults, I consider
525 
526 simply none of my business.  In other words I take an extremely selfish view --
527 as long as what you do does not affect others I do not favor any laws or other
528 coercion affecting your behaviour.  When what you do impacts others, social
529 controls of one sort or another must be imposed -- either through the courts or
530 by enraged citizenry moving down a street with a rope in their hands.  
531   Unfortunately, we as humans, tend to move over that line.  We no longer draw
532 the line of where actions impact someone else, and move it to "when you do
533 something of which I do not approve."  In my personal moral code, I attempt to
534 draw this line.  If I fail, please call me on the point.

556 So good to have you back. Without your talent the 
557 adventure really went down hill for awhile.
558 
559 It was very difficult keeping it going without the Albanians 
560 to bounce characters off of. After awhile I retired to 
561 Lurkerdom and watched. It got pretty bad.
562 
563 Things picked up when LeRoy decided to buy a chain of 
564 monasteries and start an international "rent a miricle" 
565 promotion. It caught on and an organization called the NET 
566 sprung up to meet the challenge.
567 
568 Ian MacHinnery is the power behind the NET. L'homme Sans 
569 Parity, Joshua, and Petrov have become the principle NET 
570 characters. Petrov has changed considerably since he was 
571 LeRoys' drag queen bodygaurd. 
572 
573 Ian MacHinnery writes as well as ever. L'hommes' writing has 
574 improved a great deal. Some of his stuff has been really 
575 good. Joshua and Petrov are relatively new. They tend towards 
576 long narratives, which isn't my favorite style, but they are 
577 good.
578 
579 The McKane adventure is still suffering, prepare yourself for 
580 this one, from an attack by d. Can you believe that? d, the 
581 peacemaker, the gentle soul, the feminine force of Backwater 
582 lost her cool and got nasty.
583 
584 It's no big deal, of course. We all lose our cool once in 
585 awhile. How can I be mad at d when she was the one who once 
586 cooled me down when I was the hothead?
587 
588 Anyway, glad that you're back. Maybe we'll get inspired and 
589 get things moving once again.
