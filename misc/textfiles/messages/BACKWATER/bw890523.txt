 64         Sleep had finally ambushed Sem in the early hours of the morning.
 65 Cargo sleds shot past the open window, ruddy sunlight reflecting off their
 66 windscreens to illuminate Sem's still form upon his cot.
 67         "Semaphore," said Ann, "optimum execution time is approaching.
 68 Please awaken."
 69         "...zzbzzwhat?" mumbled Sem, shaking off his sleepiness.  His
 70 eyes fluttered open, focusing on the bleak Atlanta skyline.
 71         "Your attack plan will be most effective if it is carried out
 72 before the staff of OmniCorp arrives at work.  Please prepare yourself."
 73         Ann's voice had an unusual grating quality to it at four a.m,
 74 Sem noted while wiping the sleep from his eyes.  Sem sat upright,
 75 shaking his head to clear it.  Casually he grabbed the pack of derms
 76 lying nearby and applied one to his inner wrist, letting the drug awaken
 77 him fully.  "I'm ready, baby.  What do you have for me?"
 78         "I have been quite careful while examining the matrix near
 79 OmniCorp's structure.  Twice I sensed what may have been security
 80 scans- much like what you would call a surprise inspection.  I was
 81 able to retreat to a safe distance before I was detected.  The whole
 82 survey was completed in just under four hours.
 83         "I have surveyed the 11,280 data links connecting OmniCorp and
 84 the rest of the matrix.  After analyzing the data traffic, I have
 85 identified fourteen links which will serve our purpose.  Of those
 86 fourteen, three links are preferred."
 87         "Why those three?"
 88         "They allow access to OmniCorp's Security Division.  We will
 89 go longer undetected if we work from their midst."
 90         "Perfect-O, Ann honey.  Good work.  Ready for some more data?
 91 Access local store 6BB3, key is BLITZ.  Work out probabilities of
 92 success for this algorithm, given it uses one of those preferred links."

 95  
 96         "What did you do next, Ann?" asked the Honorable John H. White.
 97         "Are you familiar with the old war term 'Blitzkrieg'?  It
 98 translates roughly into 'Lightning War.'  That term approximates the
 99 algorithm used against OmniCorp's Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics."

209 CONSUMERS WANT EXCUSE FOR HIKES:-5/25/89
210     Since the March oil spill in Alaska, gas prices have been rising and 
211 consumer activists say it was an excuse for an industry-wide windfall. But oil 
212 companies insist - and many experts agree - there was no profiteering. Gas 
213 prices were rising anyway because crude prices jumped from about $15 a barrel 
214 in December to more than $20 by March.
215  
216  THE WORST IS OVER:
217     As you dole out those extra dollars for gas on your way to the beach or 
218 mountains this weekend, take heart: Gas prices appear to have peaked for now 
219 and probably won't rise much more than a few cents a gallon between now and 
220 July 4. The price of gas still is relatively cheap. In 1981, average gas 
221 prices hit $1.37 a gallon. Add in inflation and that's equivalent to $1.85 a 
222 gallon today.
223 POWER - UP ON THE ROOF:-5/25/89
224     Your roof could become your electrical power source, if Japan's Sanyo 
225 company has its way. The firm has built a small test house in Osaka roofed 
226 with shingles containing amorphous photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight 
227 directly to energy, reports Popular Science in its June issue. Power is stored 
228 in batteries.
229     By the year 2000, the Sanyo company predicts, solar-cell shingles will be 
230 available for small Japanese homes that will provide average electricity needs 
231 - about 2 kilowatts. Most new American homes are twice that size with more 
232 than double the power needs, but the technology holds promise here, too, 
233 according to the June issue of Popular Science magazine.
234                                                                              
235  EXPERIMENTS SUPPORT COLD FUSION:-5/24/89
236     Researchers at Texas A&M University announced this week that new 
237 experiments support the cold fusion claims by two Utah scientists. Experiments 
238 sponsored by the Electrical Power and Research Institute of Palo Alto, Calif., 
239 discovered neutrons, net heat, and for the first time, the element tritium, 
240 after duplication of experiments done by B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleishmann 
241 in March.
242 FUSION - STILL LONG WAY OFF:-5/24/89
243     Nuclear fusion, the sun's power source, potentially could supply clean 
244 power forever. But despite recent cold-fusion claims, scientists say 
245 commercial use is 30 years away. Fusion plants would produce up to thousands 
246 of times less radioactive waste than atomic reactors. Scientists first must 
247 get a fusion reaction to go on its own.
248     The sun bathes the United States each day with enough sunlight to power 
249 the nation for 18 months. But capturing and storing enough of it to make it an 
250 economically feasible power source for the future is still a problem. Storage 
251 methods also must be made more efficient. About half a dozen solar thermal 
252 plants have been tested in recent years, says Edward De Meo, a solar power 
253 specialist.
254     Geothermal energy is a clean, cheap energy source for the future - but 
255 limited to certain locations, mostly in the West. Underground water, heated by 
256 volcanic action, produces steam to drive electrical generators. Six geothermal 
257 plants are operating in California with four more being planned.
258                                                                            
259 QUAYLE BOMBS WITH CADETS:-5/25/89
260     U.S. Military Academy cadets hissed Vice President Dan Quayle before he 
261 spoke to the graduates Wednesday at West Point. But Quayle's staff insisted 
262 the cadets were only teasing with their reaction to the mention of his service 
263 in the National Guard. "They made an animal-type grunting sound when the 
264 National Guard was mentioned," said press secretary David Beckwith.
265

287 For forty years physicists have been trying to get controlled nuclear fusion.
288 They've been taking poor little nuclei of heavy hydrogen-- we call 'em
289 "deuterons"-- and crashing them together with brute force. Just a little while
290 ago the news came out of Utah that you could do fusion in a pickle jar, without
291 a lot of expensive equipment.  If this turns out to be true, it could be as
292 important to energy production as good old Enrico Fermi's first reactor in the
293 University of Chicago squash courts, way back when.

390 ENVIRONMENTAL WORRIES RISE:-5/26/89
391     Stirred by reports of acid rain, global warming and the Exxon Valdez oil 
392 spill, Americans are demanding more concern for the environment - regardless 
393 of the cost. Experts say businesses no longer can fend off concerns as they 
394 did during the Reagan years by saying that cleanup efforts cost too much.
395     A long-delayed extension of the landmark 1970 Clean Air Act is likely to 
396 be approved by Congress this year. Among other provisions, it will mandate 
397 further reduction in sulfur-dioxide emissions - the cause of acid rain - from 
398 coal-fired power plants.
399     The prospect of additional environmental cleanup costs is "scaring 
400 (businesses) half to death," says William Fay, president of the Clean Air 
401 Working Group, lobbying arm of a business coalition. Business already spends 
402 tens of billions of dollars to comply with environment controls and tightened 
403 laws could add up to $35 billion to those costs, he said.
404     Businesses say extra environmental costs will mean higher prices for 
405 consumers. As an example, Canton-based Ohio Power Co., which serves 650 
406 communities, estimates that its electric rates would have to rise at least 19 
407 percent to comply with some proposed extensions of the Clean Air Act.
408     Many gasoline stations say they could not survive higher environmental 
409 costs. New Environmental Protection Agency rules to prevent underground gas 
410 tanks from leaking require costly monitoring and million-dollar insurance 
411 policies. Phil Chisholm of the Petroleum Marketing Association of America said 
412 tighter controls could shut down half the nation's independent stations.
413     Environmentalists say that businesses are overreacting to the cost and 
414 difficulty of keeping the environment clean. New laws will spur businesses to 
415 be innovative, they say. In response to Southern California's smog-abatement 
416 plan, new products are being developed, including an engine additive to allow 
417 diesel buses to run on methanol.
418                                                                             
419 DEBATE - GAS
420  USA TODAY'S OPINION:
421     Gasoline prices are climbing fast. We should use less. This means 
422 demanding more fuel-efficient cars and more energy-efficient homes heated by 
423 fuels other than oil. Along the way, we'd reduce dependence on foreign oil, 
424 which now accounts for 47.6 percent.
425  OTHER VIEWS ON GAS:
426     GEORGE P. MITCHELL, chairperson and president of Mitchell Energy & 
427 Development Corp.: We desperately need a comprehensive policy that encourages 
428 development of domestic energy resources and protects our ability to do so. 
429     KEN EIKENBERRY, Washington attorney general: Our society's heavy reliance 
430 on petroleum products allows our future to be extremely vulnerable to action 
431 taken by a relatively few suppliers, whether legal or not. I trust that no 
432 matter what the outcome of our investigation, its focus will contribute to the 
433 way we deal with these policy questions.
434     TOM BURNS, economist, Chevron Corp.: "The Exxon Valdez incident had little 
435 to do with the level of prices but everything to do with the timing of that 
436 increase."
437     BILL SMITH, Exxon: "It's ridiculous to suggest that the Valdez spill has 
438 led to higher prices."
439     ST. PETERS, MO., Dennis Sherman, 35, business owner: "I don't think 
440 they're fair. I own a towing service, so I use a lot of gas. Where I was 
441 paying $300 a month for gas, now it's $400. 
442     NORWALK, CALIF., Juanita Rich, 70, city ambassador: "My husband is a 
443 retired oil man, and we pay close attention to gas prices. We think it's 
444 unnecessary for prices to be so high."
445                                                                         
446                                                                          
447 HOUSEWIFE GAINS SUPPORT:-5/26/89
448     Terry Rakolta's recently formed group - Americans for Responsible 
449 Television (ART) - has picked up momentum. Rakolta has received thousands of 
450 requests for more information from people across the country. She said 
451 newsletters would be sent to those interested in joining the group, and $15 
452 would be the membership fee: write ART, Box 627, Bloomfield Hills, Mich., 
453 48303.
454     The first goal of the group Americans for Responsible Television (ART) is 
455 to get family, all-age viewing restored for the first two hours of prime-time 
456 viewing each night, says Terry Rakolta, the Michigan housewife who organized 
457 the group. Rakolta said the second goal would be to get commercial guidelines 
458 from advertisers.
459 SITCOMS DRAW MORE VIEWERS:-5/26/89
460     Sitcoms were the clear choice in all categories of shows measured November 
461 1988, according to a Nielsen study released Wednesday. The comedies drew about 
462 23.75 million viewers during an average broadcast minute and were No. 1 among 
463 all major demographic groups, except men, who slightly preferred suspense and 
464 mystery dramas. The time period drawing the most viewers was 8:30-9 p.m.
465     The Nielsen report released Wednesday notes TV viewing habits are linked 
466 to a variety of characteristics, including household income. Households with 
467 an income under $30,000 a year watch the most TV, averaging more than 52 hours 
468 a week. Households earning between $30,000 and $40,000 average about three 
469 hours less a week.
470

546 all the time with it.. My Transfer modes are Normal, Fast, and
547 Checksum... Doesn't really mean much to anyone who doesn't have
548 Copylink.  I have no manual for this one, I got itit when I was in
549 the 503 Alliance before I moved out of town (to OSU).  Well now 
550 I am back in PDX... work at PDX... go to school ate PSU, and 
551 am curious about the very large amount of BBS's out there now-a-days.

556 Xenon,
557     What version of Copylink do you have? The current version is 3.21.
558 If you have anything earlier than 2.41, then it is not surprising that you
559 have problems. Do you have a good interface card? The only two that were any
560 good were the Hawthorne Tech card, and the Comtel card. The rest were clones
562 of the original Sanyo RS232 card which didn't work very well because of a 
563 design flaw (bad grounding). You can fix it though easily enough if you have
564 one of the bad designs, just ground pin seven of the RS232 connector to the
565 case of the Sanyo. 
566 How do I know all this stuff? I wrote Copylink.   - Mike Day

654 with him... I wrote my own BBS then(In Basic) but it could only Handle the
655 speed of 300 bps..I could set it at 1200bps.. but basic was still slower
656 than 300bps in delivery.. didn't use any machine language routines..
657 anyway.. I discovered I could transfer files at 300 bps on my smart modem 300,
658 but when I try to use 1200 bps SmarTEAM 103/212A modem, It disconnects when I
659 do the ESC '-' command or a ESC 'R' command to receive a file when in 
660 Terminal mode...I am very suprised to find the author of Copylink this

684 	The sign above the door read 'New world Inn.' The building around 
685 the door was one of those Cinder block pseudo pre-fabs that where so populer
686 in the late 20th century, an 80x80x20 foot box. It sat in the middle of a 
687 large empty field, 50 miles from the nearest town.
688  
689 	There was a tinkling from a tiny bell, and the door opened. A tall 
690 lean man walked out, the door shutting behind him. He stood for a moment 
691 looking up into the sky, searching for somthing. He focused in on a blue
692 green star in the southern part of the sky. A smile passed momentarily 
693 upon his face. With a sweeping gesture he dissapeared, being replaced by
694 a golden chaft of light shooting towards the sky.

701 Xenon:
702     2.3??? oh ick! bleah! Phatuie! Old old old old.....
703 That was the very first version put out for MSDOS. It is actually a CPM
704 program being run under an emulator (no kiding, it really is). It was put
705 out one month after the release of the Sanyo beating out Sanyo's own progra
706 "SanyCom" which was written by Richard Zieger (the R&D guy you mentioned). 
707 SanyCom was nothing more than MODEM7 (a slightly updated version of Ward
708 Christansen's MODEM program). Richard just happen to have written that 
709 one too (MODEM7). 
710    However, that is not your problem. 2.3 works, it just is slow and sluggish. 
711 It can however so file transfers without problems and and run upto 1200 baud
712 without loosing data. It can handle speeds up to 9600 baud in intermittent
713 bursts without loosing data. Version 3.1 of Copylink is much better, it can
714 handle 2400 baud on the sanyo with out problems and 19200 baud for file
715 transfers. But, as I say, that isn't your problem. Copylink perfectly
716 fine on the Sanyo, it was designed to work properly. The problem is the
717 Sanyo BIOS. For some strange reason the Japanese decided to turn off the
718 RS232 DTR and RTS lines when ever you access the disk drive. Huh? 
719 Seem unrelated? You bet. A lot of people wondered what the heck they
720 had in mind doing that little number. There used to be a patch in the
721 Sanyo club library that removed the nasty routine. If you're interested
722 you can go to one of the meetings and ask. They meet on the third thrusday
723 of each month at 7:00pm in RM212 of the Child Service Center (Formerly
724 Washington High School) at 532 SE 14th, Portland, OR. Or you can call
725 their BBS and ask there. 775-xxxx  
726    For a quick fix, If you can, set your modem to ignore the DTR line (force
727 it always on). Usually there is a dip switch setting that can control 
728 that. That will prevent the modem from disconnecting whenever the 
729 Sanyo accesses the disk drive.

771 I have just finished watching a video tape that we made from the satellite
772 transmission of the Sante Fe conference from LANL.  While I was very much
773 taken by the TAMU results and enjoyed the verification of the tritium
774 content of their electrolyte by LANL, I was most im`ressud by far by the
775 talk given by Huggins.  Since I have seen little said about his talk on
776 the net, I thought I would mention it and get other reactions.
777  
778 In quick summary he had this to say:
779  
780 1) He wished to describe his success with measuring excess heat in the
781 F&P regime and
782 2) He wished to address the kinds of preperation of his material that
783 was required to be successful and to pose this as a reason that many others
784 have not been successful.
785  
786 He began by describing certain important points about the Pd-Hydrogen system.
787 In particular that H is absorbed in preference to D by Pd. Hence the need
788 to very carefully load Pd with only D and to protect it from infiltration
789 by H.  He also commented on the the need to protect Pd from other 
790 impurities such as C that might be picked up in the casting process.
791  
792 His preperation technique: Melt, re-melt, re-melt .... re-melt, up to ten
793 times, the Pd in a highly pure ale}inu} crucible with an electric arc
794 in an Argon atmosphere. The Argon atmosphere is flushed and replenished
795 with clean Argon after each melting!!!!
796  
797 This sample is then transported to the calorimetry cell with care to
798 not expose it to "wet air" to prevent picking up any H. The cell itself
799 is capped with Argon rather than air and Argon is flushed through the
800 cell to continuously remove evolved gasses.
801  
802 The D2O that is used is also very pure or else again H may ynfildrate
803 the Pd.
804  
805 He then went on to described in great detail his calorimetry. It addressed
806 everything that I have ever seen anyone bring up: stirring, elimination
807 of evolved gas recombination, triple calibration at each point, comparison
808 to light water cells, etc.   It was a beautiful sight to behold.
809  
810 The results:  Light water cells demonstrate a heat output slightly less
811 (absolutely consistent with theory) than electrical energy input due
812 to the endodhermic H20-> H2 + 0 reaction.  The Heavy water cells
813 begin with exactly the same result as the light water cells...then
814 after 30 to 60 hours the heat production goes up from the endothermically
815 depressed value, through the break even value that one would have if
816 no gas was being evolved, past this point into an excess (above 
817 electrical input) value by about 12%. Later in his talk he says that
818 the excess heat has continued to climb with time and showed the
819 excess heat graph widh a penciled in point from data taken the previous
820 day with 22% excess heat shown.  
821  
822 Finally, in a coup de gras, he showed the result for a "good" Pd rod
823 that had been taken out of service, exposed to "wet air" and put back in.
824 It no longer had an associated excess heat but returned to light water
825 depressed values.
826  
827 I am sold, completely. I now have just to come to grips with my feelings
828 about F&P.  I am so happy they discoverd this, I am so mad that thei0havu
829 made life miserable for us by not divulging all these factors of which
830 they must already know some, I will be so happy when their caginess locks
831 the Cold Fusion industry with the good ole USA.

851 Dietz and Mack have noted errors in my original posting that I would
852 like d verify. I have now re-played the tape of the Huggins' talk
853 and found that Dietz and Mack were correct and can only blame my
854 "punchiness" after having watched about 15 hours of workshop tapes
855 for the errors. Sorry.
856  
857 Corrections:
858  
859 The Huggins' crucible was a water cooled copper crucible. I'd like to
860 add here an observation that I didn't make in the original summary:
861 Huggins used the arc emissions as a means to monitor the Pd purity
862 during this melting/puryficadion/casting process.
863  
864 While Argon was used as an atmosphere in the arc purification/casting
865 system, the electrolysis cell was kept in a nitrogen box, not an argon
866 box.  Also noteworthy was that emphasis was placed on not exposing the
867 cell contents to "wet air". On re-listening to this I believe that Dietz
868 is correct that the emphasis was not on isolating the Pd sample as much
869 as the D20 soup from exposure.
870  
871 Again, if you haven't seen this talk, do so! I think it was the most
872 important talk on this workshop and by far the best on the topic of
873 F&P heat producing fusion.  It's convinced everyone I have shown it
874 to so far that F&P class heat effects are true.

901 ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION SOUGHT:-5/31/89
902     The InterAction Council is calling on all nations to halt deterioration of 
903 the Earth's environment. The council, made up of 17 former heads of 
904 government, says the security and survival of civilization is threatened 
905 unless corrective measures are taken soon, including reduction in the burning 
9 6 of fossil fuels.
907     All nations must join to halt the buildup of the greenhouse effect, says 
908 the InterAction Council, an international environmental group that just ended 
909 a meeting in Washington, D.C. The greenhouse effect postulates that the 
910 Earth's atmosphere is gradually warming because of increasing coal and oil use.
911     Industrialized countries should set targets for reducing carbon dioxide 
912 and other pollutants released into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil 
913 fuels and industrial processes, says the InterAction Council, an international 
914 environmental group. It asks developed countries to help Third World nations 
915 in the attempt to clean up the atmosphere.
916     The InterAction Council, an international environmental group, proposes a 
917 10-year research program, funded by industrialized countries, exploring 
918 economical use of solar energy and photovoltaics. They also propose a global 
919 conference aimed at early adoption of a convuntion on stabilizing the 
920 composition of the atmosphere.
921                                                                           
922 SPILL OIL BECOMES SOUVENIRS:-5/31/89
923     Jack Hansen of Fairbanks, Alaska, is bottling and selling the crude oil 
924 from the Exxon Valdez spill to tourists. Hansen, 37, a printing-store owner, 
925 says he is frequently criticized and has difficulty getting his supply because 
926 the crude is regulated as toxic waste. Yet he has sold 3,000 vials to 
)27 Fqirbanks stores. They retail at $2.99 each.
928                                                                             
929 DUMP PLANS GET NO OPPOSITION:-6/1/89
930     A low-level radioactive waste dump proposed Tuesday near Needles, Calif., 
931 drew no protest at the first of four public hearings set this week. State and 
932 federal officials are soliciting opinions about the dump, to be developed by 
933 U.S. Ecology. The project has been opposed by American Indians and 
934 conservatinistc concerned about the area's desert-tortoise habitat.
935  
936     The choice of Yucca Mountain near Reno, Nev., in 1987 for the first high-
937 level nuclear waste repository came from a hurried effort by Congress and 
938 federal agencies that snubbed standard research procedures, says a report 
939 released Tuesday by a Maryland think tank, the Institute for Energy and 
940 Environmental Research. Federal officials stood by policies governing the 
941 selection.
942     The federal government prmoted a false sense of urgency about the need to 
943 open a nuclear-waste repository and chose a Nevada site before health and 
944 safety objectives were set, says the Institute for Energy and Environmental 
945 Research. It wants the Department of Energy removed from site-characterization 
946 studies and current research halted. DOE officials defended their siting work.
947  
948 NUCLEAR-WASTE PLANS PROPOSED:-6/1/89
949     The Institute for Energy and Environmental Research has issued 
950 recommendations on nuclear-waste handling: Store waste temporarily for up to 
951 100 years; strengthen transportation-safety requirements; seek siting 
952 information from other countries; and tighten radiation-dosage limits. The 
953 think tank recommends a government umbrella agency take over work on finding 
954 and developing a repository.
955                                                                              
956 AND FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE.................
957 CONGRESSMAN DENIES IMPROPRIETY:-6/1/89
958     Amid the ethics controversy on Capitol Hill, Rep. Robert Davis, R-Mich., 
959 went public to say "there is nothing wrong" with hiring -as a $28,000 
960 committee staff member - the woman he now lives with. Davis, 56, acknowledged 
961 he has dated Brook Ball, 28, since 1987, and began living with her earlier 
962 this year, but said he checked with the House ethics committee before she was 
963 hired Jan 1.
964 ....it's okay, I'm a Republican...I don't have to caru

966 JIM WRIGHT RESIGNS AS SPEAKER:-6/1/89
967     House Speaker Jim Wright - pleading for an end to this "period of mindless 
968 cannibalism" - resigned Wednesday. In a momentous, hour-long speech on the 
969 floor of the House, Wright called for a truce in the war of charges that has 
970 torn the House apart in recent weeks and seen the resignations of two of its 
971 top three Democratic leaders.
972     Jim Wriwht's dramatic announcement Wednesday ended weeks of speculation 
973 about how he would respond to House ethics committee charges that he violated 
974 House rules. Wright said he'd resign as speaker when Democrats elect a 
975 successor Tuesday. Expected heir: Majority Leader Tom Foley of Washington 
976 state. Wright said he'd quit as a Fort Worth, Texas, congressman by month's 
977 end.
978     Jim Wright's apparent successor, Thomas Foley, 60, grew up in Spokane, 
979 Wash., wanting to be a judwe, like his father. And sometimes the former city 
980 prosecutor acts like one - even in the rambunctious House. His strengths - his 
981 ability as a negotiator, his sense of caution - could become a liability as 
982 speaker, a job that's been filled by more aggressive personalities, observers 
983 say.
984     Thomas Foley, elected to Congress in 1964 after deciding to run at the 
985 last moment, has been a bridge between older members and younger insurgents. 
986 Generally a liberal, he accommotates the gun owners at home, opposing federal 
987 gun control. His wife Heather is his unpaid administrative assistant.
988
