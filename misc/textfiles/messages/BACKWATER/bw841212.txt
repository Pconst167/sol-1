36           The Crook County Cowboys
37 
38      They play football.  On a rainy December afternoon they came to Portland to challenge the big boys.  In the end, they
39 took the whole works... the state championship.  A bunch of small town kids from the sleepy community of Prineville scrambled
40 their way to greatness.  They're known as the Crook County Cowboys.
41      It's time to come out of the closet.  I'm a Cowboy fan.  I've tried taking the cure--no luck.  It's in my blood.  I 
42 grew up in Prineville.  It was all I knew for seventeen years.  We're the champs and I'm damn proud.
43      Nestled in a river valley in Oregon's high desert, Prineville is the essence of an American small towm.  Prineville is
44 Spoon River, Peyton Place, and redneck central in one neat package.  Perceptions of the real world are distorted by distance
45 and attitude.
46      Kids in Prineville have two options after high school:  stay or escape.  You can see some of those who stay sitting
47 in a dingy lumbermill lunch room, hunched over a bologna sandwich, waiting for the noon whistle to call them back to work.
48 Their ears are deafened by the screaming saws slashing through fragrant pine wood.  Others work the rich, black earth, 
49 trying to eke out an existence from the land.  They battle sweltering summers, thermometer-cracking winters, and an
50 uncaring government bureaucracry.
51      Life in Prineville can be full of despair and toil.  Those who live there struggle to preserve traditional values in 
52 a world that seems to be thundering toward oblivion.  But there is a satisfaction and contentment in Prineville born from a
53 closeness to the land.  And sometimes in this bittersweet environment, a spark of greatness is ignited and begins to grow.
54      Seven years ago, some kids decided to create their own options, light their own spark.  While in the eighth grade, an 
55 entire class set a goal of winning the state football championship their senior year.  On December 8th, that class realized
56 their dream and the dreams of small towns everywhere.  They won the championship.  Imagine the committment, the dedication
57 of those kids.  Those rose from their small town, and if just for a moment, acheived greatness.
58      The Cowboys of 1984 will be a legend now, recalled whenever any small town comes to Portland to take on the big boys
59 for the championship.  Prineville will fondly reminisce about the '84 team for decades to come.  Some may sneer at their 
60 acheivement, but the simple fact remains... We're the champs.  Yes, I'm a Cowboy fan, and I'm damn proud.
61 
62                                                    Dr. Frankenstupe

65 L'homme: I can correct the line & then upload the file again. The new copy 
66 will replace the old. I'll have to re-enter the description block, so I'll
67 be sure to note that the old version had a bug.
68 MIG: I seem to have been mistaken for you. Any suggestions?

70 Dr. F. Fragrant Pine Trees? Gimme a break!
71 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
72      Dr. Frankenstupe sat transfixed in front of the flickering television
73 set.  He didn't notice the distinguished gentleman in a tweed jacked enter
74 the room.  The 'Young and Restless' was on the tube.  The gentleman paused
75 for a moment, then cleared his throat.
76      "Ahem, Doctor Frankenstupe, I think we should talk."
77      Frankenstupe tried to wave the gentleman away.  "Not now, Sigmund, 
78 Julia just told Eric that he is the father of her baby.  This is important."
79 Sigmund shrugged and settled into a chair.  He knew that Frankenstupe would
80 allow no interruptions during his soap opera.
81      Finally the show was over.  Frankenstupe turned off the set and turned
82 to his visitor.  "Okay, Sigmund, what is it?"
83      Sigmund lit his pipe. "Well, Doctor, I've been your therapist for these
84 last several months, and frankly, I'm worried."
85      "About what?"
86      "Your visits to the Inn and the essay you've written on the Cowboys.
87 I can't see the point in it."
88      "Well,"  Frankenstupe said, "it was something I felt strongly about.
89 You've always said that I should try to express my feelings, not hide them."
90      "I can accept that.  But the part about the fragrant pine wood, that 
91 doesn't wash.  A pine 2 X 4 is not fragrant."
92      "Yes, somebody else made that comment, and it started to make me mad.
93 In the Inn, often someone will make an effort to enter something and some
94 one else will discount the whole thing with a cutesy one liner."
95      "Hmmmm.  Yes, but you've done that yourself.  Right?"
96      "Yes, I have.  But basically we may have a perceptual difference.
97 Granted a pine board isn't fragrant, but try a walk in a pine forest after a
98 thunderstorm."  Frankenstupe closed his eyes for a moment, remembering.  "Or
99 walk into a lumbermill on a warm August evening.  I perceived freshly cut
100 pine as being very fragrant.  It was not just a literary device.  Maybe he
101 who doesn't feel the way I do just perceives things differently."
102      Sigmund sat in silence for a time, then said, "Doctor, you have a point
103   By the way Pam called to see how you were getting along."
104      The Doctor brightened.  "Really, she's a fine woman.  What did you tell
105 her?"
106      "I told her you might be getting out soon.  You'll have to start making
107 plans for returning to the real world."  Frankenstupe lapsed into silence to
108 ponder this new turn of events.

169 Milchar kneels, frantically searching his cards for an escape spell.  Bard 
170 and L'homme work feverishly to make an electronic blasting device activa-
171 ted by the harmonics of Piper's chanter. We are tense, urgent.  The crystal
172 beauty of Diamond Valley is now jagged and glaring to us. My throat is 
173 tight with fear. It has finally become apparent to us that we may never 
174 return to the Inn.  I stare at the clasp of the necklace.  It reminds me of
175 something, but what? Think. Be calm. Try to remember. Relax. Slow down.
176 Slow down FASTER. Relax HARDER! HURRY UP AND CALM DOWN!!!
177 ooooooops.
178 I've activated my incomplete teletransportation powers. I'm on a sunny 
179 beach. It's quiet and safe and now I truly AM relaxed.  For the first time
180 in days I breathe slowly and deeply and lie on the sand feeling sleepy and
181 satisfied.
182 "Hello, Pilgrim."
183 It's Mariani.  Guilt shades my peace.
184 "Er...your people...Are they....?"
185 "We are getting liquid from the center of a jungle fruit, but can't do so
186 much longer." He is tired, not angry.
187 "We're trapped," I babble, "We don't know the right magic. We're devising a
188 powerful electronic...."
189 "The necklace is a key. A simple mechanical key. It opens the lock to the
190 North Door which will take you directly home. The necklace has magic and
191 complexity also, but they are of no use to you until you have mastered the
192 humble part of its nature."
193 "Oh." The clasp looked familiar because it was embossed with the design of
194 the North Door. Typical. We try for exotic complicated escapes when there  
195 is a big door right in front of us and we're holding the key.
196 "Uh...I don't exactly know how to get back."
197 "I see." Mariani looks both amused and despairing. "I can take you as far
198 as Gold Sand. The gods help you after that."
199 Using his own sorcery, he summons a fine arching wave and we ride it to a
200 deserted shore. Mariani smiles softly.
201 "May the gods be merciful," he mutters and sails off.
202 The golden sand stretches away without a bush or a pebble or a ripple or   
203 even a horizon until it becomes one with a golden sky in which I can barely
204 discern a pure white winged creature soaring in beautiful arcs.

233      For once, I come not swirled in mist, but to challenge the critic
234 who has naught on his lips and a sneer on his face:  there, the figure
235 idling behind the rhinestone-enrobed Doctor!  Your swipes are quite
236 unwarranted, and only further ennoble yon Frankenstupe fellow for his
237 grave, cordial response!  
The story was charming, and the touches of
238 whimsy (like 8th grade vows and hunched backs over bologna) breathed
239 life into his essay; but 'twas the fragrance of pine & sod that moved
240 me in their honest simplicity.  How dare you curse the very tingle 
241 that made his story taste good?!  
Dr. Frankenstupe, you are nigh on
242 a stranger to me, yet I salute you.  Indeed, free-blown writing DOES
243 beget inspiration, and Mikey's unexpected gem touched me, along with
244 Pamela's song...so I wrote a little ditty of appreciation, though
245 none saw my efforts but you...In turn, YOU wrote of the inspired 
246 gleam that was triggered in all of our eyes, and captured the very
247 spark that makes the Inn's magic--!  
You, my friend, are fanning
248 the hearth flames, an honor oft held by Pamela and, on occasion, my
249 privilege.  Do not let one snide remark squelch your spirit, nor
250 allow petty attacks to dampen your enthusiasm; please, carry on!

267 don't remember it, just take my word for it, you enjoyed yourself.
268 Hex-dump. May I ask why? is this a taunt? so I will rack my head for
269 days on end trying to decipher random garbage? Well, if it is garbage, it's 
270 damn good garbage, it has patterns!
271 Sondergaard:Hum, we may have to talk to whomever was using your terminal that 
272 night. I will drop it for now. Let me know when you find out who Papa Smurfs

280 Mig: ahemm, the subject I am refering to is a cooparative, profitable
281 writing of a said comic book.

290 All:  Since the spellings of more than just my name is rather difficult,
291 you might find it a little easier if you would copy down the name of the
292 person from the bottom of one of their articles. Makes things a lot simpler!
293     As you might notice, spelling mistakes are common (I make 'em myself)
294 but Names should be treated a little more carefully since you are actually
295 addressing a Person and not a dictionary.  (Yes, I note your l/c; kathy, MiG)
296 
297 MiG:  Well, the truth of the matter is-  this is PaPa Smurf's terminal, he just
298    doesn't realize that I spend HOURS connecting to all these systems...
299    And, oh, I don't believe he has a girl friend on this system; unless {Tammy}
300    works at the P.M. Lab also... I wonder about that myself since PaPa Smurf
301    has only made 1 (one) entry onto *this* system...
302   >As to who else uses this terminal, the only other person I let on anymore
303    is an old lurker called  'abacab'   The smurf doesn't know about that though
304 
305 Prometheus:  Greetings and Salutations!         I think I can tell you with all
306    confidence that 'I HAVE TODAY (Thur) OFF' and I will be hunting all day...
307    For some reason, since I transfered from somewhere in The North to India
308    I haven't been able to even FORCE myself out of bed unless I would be late
309    for the job...   I have some more cookies for us all, and by the way, is 
310    the 'ANN' you mentioned the same one you have given cookies to before?

317    Floating limply, the pegasus slept.  for an endless space around her, all
318 that was visible were endless expanses of golden light, twined through with 
319 tendrils of absolute black.  For uncounted hours, she had tried to fly to one
320 of these, the one that appeared nearest.  Uncounted hours of ceasless effort
321 had made no visible difference in its appearance.  A feeling that she might as
322 well be flying to the moon crept over her as her fatigue mounted.  Only the
323 state of complete exhaustion she finally reached could overcome her instincts --
324 for a pegasus does not sleep on the wing.  For her to sleep in flight -- even 
325 effortless floating -- was normally simply suicide.
326   Perhaps it is best that we never know what dreams tormented her that long
327 unmeasured sleep.  It is hard enough to try to imagine the reaction we would
328 have to awaking in free-fall.  What panic would this awaken in a best that 
329 normally flys?  How can we imagine the mortal terror that could fill her to
330 overflowing?  Coupled with an unpleasant rest, this could be enough to tip
331 a human mind over into complete insanity.  Only the simpler organization of
332 the beast mind saved her -- leaving mental scars that would take long to heal.

341 babble senselessly over a piece of art, sometimes you just
342 sit back and enjoy it for what it is.
343 
344 All: Well, I see by the paper a couple of days ago that someone
345 stole a street in phillidelphia, PA. That's right, STOLE it! They
346 dug it up and carted it away. Boy, even the streets aren't safe
347 any more. What's this world coming to?
348 
349 Also, I notice in another paper (Electronics news) that Honeywell is
350 closing down Synertek and taking a $70-$100 million write off on it.
351 In case you don't know who Synertek is, if you were to pry open the
352 lid of an Atari, you would find that the CPU chip, Roms, and much of
353 the LSI to have labels indicating they were made by Synertek.
354 Synertek made its nitch in the industry by producing cheap low density
355 parts. Unfortunatly, beyond the game industry, no one is interested.
356 And with the game industry dieing, so goes Synertek. 
357 
358 Other bits of news: TI will be laying off 2000 next month due to the
359 current sag in the IC industry. NCR will stop making its PC, it seems
360 that no one was interested in it. And, the memory market is currently
361 getting very competitive. You can probably expect 64K ram to drop
362 solidly into the $3 range soon, and 256kK chips already showing up
363 for under $20 will solidly drop into that price range. Since they are
364 in full production now, there is no reason for them not to, particularly
365 with the current weak market.

367 Pam: No answer? Sigh, it's at times like this that I wish I hadn't

372 P.S. If you are really interested in the how and why of the Federal
373 reserves handling of the economy the last few years, go down to the
374 library and dig out the Dec 7,1984 (fri) issue of the Wall street
375 Journal, front page right column titled "Monetary Zeal". It describes
376 how the feds change in policy caused the rampant interest rates a
377 couple of years ago, and also is the very reason for getting inflation
378 under control today. The policy change was to stop controling intreest
379 rates, and to start controling the money supply instead. A very 
380 informative article, and one I would strongly recommed anyone to read
381 before poping off about who is to blame for the interest rates, and
382 who gets cudos for stopping rampant inflation. No real surprizers,
383 just good inside information on the workings of your government.

391 Mig: That hex dump looks suspiciously like an a Motorola (or was it Intel?)
392 Loader file. I've got a program from the M100 SIG on CIS that reads files that
393 look VERY similar. I _might_ be able to dig out the specs by Sat. As I recall
394 each line starts :<load address><byte count?>. Wait a sec, the first byte has
395 something to do with what kind of block follows... I'll *HAVE* to find those

459   Omega lifted his feet slowly and placed them slowly on the wooden, creaking timbers. I don't think Omega wanted anyone to
460 see him first. Especialy in this place, the most arcane of all the arcane shops in Portland.
461 
462   As the latest and loudest creak faded, a small old lady appeared in one doorway. Her reflection appeared on all the glass
463 cases in the shop. Fragments of her face shone brightly in the candlelitglass faces of each case.
464 
465   The little old lady opened her mouth to speak, but Omega quickly and loudly interupted this action. "Hi, uh, I am here for,
466 er that is, a Christmass present." How gracefully he had lied.
467 
468   After little moment of twinkling in her eyes, the old lady said "Oh, for who, a son?"
469 
470   "No," He would have explained the truth but she interupted.
471   "A daughter then?"
472   "No, neither, for myself."
473   "Your..." She seemed suprised, but it was not her style to show this openly. She continued " .. self, what did you want? A
474 deck? A trinket?"
475   "Neither, I want..." He carefully decided what he was going to say "your services as..." He carefully decided what ELSE to
476 say. Again he spoke " ... a mystic or whatever you call yourslelves these days."
477   "Witches is the term, I never did like Modern Marketing."
478   "I wish you too tell me about..." Omega was tiring off all this hoopla, he blurted out the rest of it.
479   "I want you to tell me why I have switched universes. I don't know where I am, but my life is different. In mine Dangerfield
480 is still alive, in my life..." Omega realized that his point was made.
481 
482    "Oh, you mean that the way you thought about things has changed." She spoke in the same patronizing tone that Psychaitrists
483 always spoke in.
484    Omega started thinking the obvious; That she thought he was insane. She was wrong, and Omega knew it, he had the Other to
485 prove it.
486 
487 
488   "I am not insane! I can prove it to you if you want. Somehow, someway, I am not in the same universe I was three days ago!"
489 
490   "Why do you think this?" She said in her condescending tone. One that barely concealed her centempt for him. She felt soooo
491 superior to this man. She had a degree in Psychaitry, she was trained to deal with his kind.
492 
493   Omega knew he had to come down to her level if he was going to convince her, and if he came down to her level, she might
494 convince him he was insane.
495 
496   If he was insane, she might as well tell him. He sure couldbn't tell. So he explained everything that happened, with all the
497 facts about Net and all that carefully replaced with tallk of a ditch digging company.
498 
499   She sat on her high backed chair, arms carefully placed on the arm rests. And let her eyes twinkle. She was contemplating.
500 
501   She decided on her path of operation. She was going to tell him the truth, and try to convince him to stop using those nasty
502 hallucinogenics. She did not think Omega was insane, just addicted to some chemical.
503 
504   "Bhagwan Shree Dangerfield is still alive, and Ma Prem Rivers has apoologized publicly. She said it was all aa joke. She sid
505 it was her sense of humor!"
506   The little old witch's eyes twinkled happily as a smile swept slowly across Omega face. She had decided to tell him about
507 Dangerfield and Rivers first, since he seemed to place them as highly as he did.
508 
509   "I was only gone for a little while, I remember that. It was funny as hell though." Omega tried to forget that she had eight
510 Neeshies killed that night, just to show she was still boss.
511 
512   "Anyway, Dangerfield is still alive, and never even had Xenopolycythemia, I have never even heard of that. Do you know more
513 about it?" She was trying to switch gently into a less inflamatory subject. Letting her professional curiosity shine through.
514 
515   "Are you sure he never had it? And no, I don't know anything more about the disease." Omega was elated, and his face showed
516 it. Somehow he had switched back to his own reality. And his own 'Time-Continuum'
517 
518   Later, after a small lecture on halucinogenics and a tour of the shop, he left the small store. It was raining outside, and
519 it was winter. Somehow, Omega welcomed the biting sharpness of the cold. It gave him a sense of reality he wanted a lot right
520 then.
521 
522   Putting some quarters into a newspaper stand in the Transit Mall, he pulled out an Oregonian newspaper. He read the headline
523 of it, and was given a cold feeling worse than the weather.

527   ANTELOPE (AP)- An attempt was made on the life of Bhagwan Shree Dangerfield today. A cloase advisor used a small automatic
528 weapon and fired several shots into Dangerfield's meditation cubicle. Luckily Bhagwan Dangefield wasn not in the cubicle at
529 the time of the incident. The assailent was shot by security teams acting as Police for the unratified city.
530  It seems that he was insane with jealousy of the Bhagwans diinity said Swami Jonee Carson after the incident was over.

536      Leo was getting really hungry now, she hadn't eaten in almost two 
537 full days, Ontho still hadn't cracked the mind control code and they
538 had orders not to return to home base untill their mission was done.
539 "S**T!" Leo exclamed, Ontho looked back to see what crabby wanted, The
540 Inmo felt that the code was close to being broken, but Ontho wanted to
541 get into the dome to look at the equipment.  Leo had dropped the trident
542 on her foot and was dancing about madly.. "rezze dez taz?" Ontho was
543 tring to be reasuring, but Leo was in a frenzy. 
544     "Ok we will go into the dome, I don't like it but it's got to be done."
545 Leo barked.   Leo picked up the trident and shethed it. "let's go!"
546      Ontho moved the disk close to the dome to allow for a quick getaway
547 and the two jumped down onto the ramp, they hurried inside since now that
548 they had left the disk they were exposed to whatever eye would glance their
549 way.
550       Inside the dome was one big room, with a controller in the center
551 and many charts on the walls, it was unoccupied.   Leo walked over to the
552 wall and started examining the charts while Ontho checked out the controller.
553      "Hey look at this!" Leo exclamed, these charts show all the locations
554 of the recent earthquakes, the depict large caverns like the one we are in"
555 "these yuglies have been blasting holes in the earth to open up more living
556 space!" and the heat of the receding lava helps them generate energy, this
557 is most reveiling, I wonder how many more established settlements there are
558 on earth?"   Ontho was listening out of one ear and watching Leo with a
559 couple of eyes, but mostly paying attention to the controller, the Inmo
560 now felt confident that the mind control could be stopped.
561     "What's wrong, didn't you hear what I said?" Leo turned to Ontho who
562 wasn't paying a bit of attention to her at the moment.  Leo moved towards
563 Ontho and picked the Inmo up. Ontho on the other hand didn't feel like
564 being handled, and had much work to do and a few more problems to solve.
565 "puzzz kezzz fewz!" (which meens, put me down dummy!)
566      Leo was furious and hurdled Ontho to the hard floor where the little
567 alien landed with a painful crack. "izzzzzz" Ontho hissed and bolted
568 tenicles a flalling, grabbing Leo sacred trident, waving it in from of her
569 face, making a menacing scene.  The lack of food and sleep had Leo at her
570 deadly worst and she kicked at Ontho, knocking the Inmo onto the controller
571 Leo then leaned over Ontho to retrieve the trident, the trident slipped 
572 from Ontho's tenicle and accidently hit a power source on the controller
573 causing  a bright flash and lightning like arcing, the controller began
574 to smoke and Leo pulled Ontho to safety, the trident in her hand still
575 had and electric arc to the controller and strange things began to happen.

578    "The problem all began when I stopped wearing dresses."  The man sat cross-
579 legged in his tent at the commune.  Across from him sat his only friend,
580 Cheekoof.  Petrov contemplated his present situation.
581    It had been at least four months since that fateful day when he left his
582 helicopter and crossed the wilderness -- mortally afraid of an Indian attack.
583 The commune had quickly "converted" him, or so he led them to
584 believe.  He only pretended to eat the "specially prepared" food they gave him.
585    Petrov remembered the confused state he was in when he arrived.
586 Before him was a paper he wrote a week after entering the commune.  Picking it
587 up, he read aloud to the ever attentive Cheekoof.
588 
589      "All has become clear to me.  Amidst the maelstrom of confusion which
590 consumes all facets of mortal life, I alone have been enlightened.  Ah the
591 countless, nameless individuals who have likened life to the game of Chess
592 without truly comprehending the potential depth of their musings.
593      Dimensions.  The pitiful life of a chess piece: fleeting, restricted,
594 controlled, two-dimensional.  When two dimensions are all that is known, how
595 complete seems the life.  In all its glorified strength, however, even the
596 most powerful piece cannot compare to the mind that wields it.  The mind which
597 dwells in three dimensions.
598      So we praise the glory of three dimensions.  Our lives are full and
599 complete.  Dare we stop to consider the entity which rules the fourth dimension?
600 Time!  He who truly understands it can move through time as we can travel north,
601 south, east, or west.  He can choose not to move in that direction, and time, for
602 him, would stand still (at least we would perceive it that way).
603      Some call the entity of which I speak God.  Others call it fate.  But I
604 know it.  I have seen it.  It has a name and that is McKane.  He exists above
605 the laws of science.  He controls, manipulates, conquers.  They say he is dead,
606 but I know better.  McKane could foresee death, and avoid it.
607      Only one other being has displayed such power.  In another reality, in
608 another time, a certain Innkeeper brought the world to its knees using only the 
609 power of words.  Indeed, the ultimate control over anything is the ability to
610 destroy it."
611 
612    Petrov's voice trailed off.  He noted the profound look on Cheekoof's face.
613 "Don't worry Cheekoof,  McKane was just an ordinary man with incredible
614 abilities."  Petrov was now back to his former self.  The greatest therapy in
615 the world, work, had given him renewed purpose.  Through the past several months
616 Petrov had been uncovering the mysteries of the commune.  As time went on he had
617 become quite "close" to Ma Prem Rivers.
618    Petrov smiled to himself while remembering how angry she got every time he
619 called her Honored Matre during moments of passion.  No woman could excite
620 Petrov the way Honored Matre did that blissful evening so long ago.
621    Petrov hoped to enter the service of the NET.  He needed to start again.  He 
622 turned to Cheekoof.  "And I will wear dresses again -- I'll dance in sleazy
623 dives.  It's part of my heritage."  Petrov's optimism faded.  "But I'm afraid
