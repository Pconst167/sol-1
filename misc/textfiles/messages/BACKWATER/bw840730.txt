25 Dearest Pam;
26      Please hurry!  The neighbors are getting up a petition to throw me out
27 of the neighborhood.  I'm completely out of raw meat.  The kitty litter
28 doesn't work.  The doo-doo is up to my knees, and my canary, Wilbur, is
29 missing.  Oh God! I don't think I can stand it much longer.

31 P.S.  I also accept Visa, Mastercharge, Diner's Club, or Mervyn's.

39 Have you ever noticed some of the striking similaritys between Bloom
40 County and Doonesbury?  'Fer instance, what about Bill?  Hyped on drugs,
41 always out for a quick buck, and a great big hoopla after his death.
42 Sounds a lot like Ambassidor Duke!  And now, they have both come back from
43 certain death.  In fact, almost all the B.C. caracters have a counterpart
44 in Doonesbury.  Look at this partial list...
45 Milo, journalist- Rick Redfrend, Post jounalist
46 Opus, a strange character- Zonker Harris, just as strange
47 Confused kid- Mike Doonesbury, kind of lost
48  (Milo's friend, I forgot the name.)
49 Quiche Loranne, Mankiller- Boopsie, Mike's girlfriend

51 The list goes on and on.  Ponder that.  Is Berkly Breathed really

69 STAVING(STARVING?)ARTIST: YES THE SIMILARITIES COULD GO FOR EVER. BUT IF AN
70 ARTIST IS WHAT YOU ARE, PERHAPS THE ONE THING WHICH MIGHT JUSTIFY YOUR
71 HYPOTHESIS HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED, NAMELY THE GRAPHIC DETAILING AND THE INKING.
72 FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, MOST NOTABLY THE EYES, NOSES AND MOUTHS, ARE A DEAD
73 GIVEAWAYS. IF YOU EXAMINE CROCK, B.C. AND THE WIZARD OF ID YOU NOTE THAT 
74 THEY ARE QUITE SIMILAR. NOE IT DOESN'T TAKE SHERLOCK TO POINT OUT THAT ALL
75 OF THE AFOREMENTIONED HAVE THE SAME WRITERS AND/OR ARTISTS, BUT THE IDEA IS
76 TO SHOW THAT PEN NAMES CAN BE USED BY THOSE WHO DRAW AS WELL. SO ANYWAY--
77 DOES THE LACK OF MATERIAL ON DRIVE B MEAN THAT THE COLLAPSE OF MCKANES'
78 EMPIRE IS COMPLETE? HMMMMM.
79 FIN LOOKED AT THE WALL AND CONTEMPLATED HOW THE LIBIYAN FREELANCE AGENTS'
80 ASSOCIATION WOULD TAKE THE IDEA OF SPACE TRAVEL. THEY HAD BEEN A RELUCTANT
81 GROUP OF DISSIDENTS, NOT WANTING TO CHANGE THEIR WAYS FROM THOSE OF THE
82 LATE 1990'S WHEN THEY HAD REALLY BEEN AT THEIR BEST, BUT SINCE THE 2035
83 ACCORD CONDEMNING TERRORISM AND PLACING A DEATH SENTENCE UPON TERRORISTS
84 BUSINESS HAD BEEN SLOW ON EARTH. THE $500,000 REWARD FOR TURNING IN A
85 BONIFIDE TERRORIST HELPED ALSO. THE PHONE RANG TWICE, THEN WAS ANSWERED
86 BY A WOMAN WITH A DEFINITE BROOKLYN ACCENT. FIN SPENT THE FORMALITIES
87 NEEDED BY WORD OF MOUTH AND GAVE A CREDIT NUMBER. AFTER HANGING UP THE
88 PHONE HE LOOKED AT LASETER, WHO HAD HIS FACE PRESSED AGAINST THE 500
89 GALLON AQUARIUM GLASS, OBSERVING NOTHING IN PARTICULAR.
90 "WELL MY BOY! WE'VE GOT 50 AGENTS BEING BRIEFED RIGHT NOW. WHEN THEY'VE
91 FINISHED THEY'LL HOP THE NEXT SHUTTLE OUT AND WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY!" FIN
92 WAS SMILING FROM ONE SIDE OF HIS FACE TO THE OTHER. HE BEGAN TO HUM AN
93 OLD SPACERS TUNE AND STEEPLE HIS HANDS. LASETER LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER
94 AND FROWNED. "NOT TO BE ANTICLIMACTIC OLD FELLOW, BUT WHERE DO YOU GET
95 THIS "WE" STUFF? AS FAR AS THIS ENTERPRISE YOU'VE GOT IN MIND GOES, IT'S
96 GOING WITHOUT ME! THAT LITTLE EPISODE IN THE SLUDGE TANKS DID IT FOR ME."
97 THE LOOK OF DISGUST ON LASETERSS' FACE SAID THE REST. FIN SAT BEHIND THE
98 DESK, GRINNING LIKE A CHESHIRE CAT. "I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY, BUT I
99 BELIEVE THAT YOUR CONTRACT COVERS THIS. I QQUOTE PARAGRAPH 17, SUBPARA-
100 GRAPH A: " IN THE EVENT THAT THE PARTY OF THE SECOND PART (THAT'S YOU)
101 SHOULD FAIL TO DELIVER THOSE GOODS FOR WHICH THEY ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
102 FOR, THEN THE PARTY OF THE SECOND PART (AHEM! THAT'S ME!!) WILL HAVE THE
103 RIGHT TO PLACE THE PARTY OF THE FIRST PART UNDER THE CUSTODY OF THE NEAREST
104 INTERSPACIAL LAW AGENCY UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE GOODS LOST SRE RECOVERED
105 OR PAYED FOR." LASETER LEAPED ACROSS THE ROOM."YOU LITTLE FREELOADER!!
106 I DON'T RECALL SIGNING ON WITH YOU. I DON'T EVEN RECALL THE CONTRACT!!"
107 FIN SLOWLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS " THERE IT IS, MY BOY, IN BLACK AND
108 WHITE. AND I DO BELIEVE YOU'LL FIND THE LOCAL JUDGE TO BE QUITE ADAMANT
109 ABOUT ENFORCING THE LAW" LASETER WAS READY TO SWEAR THAT FIN WAS STARTING
110 TO FADE FROM VIEW. HIS MIND WAS WORKING AT A FURIOUS RATE, TRYING TO COME
111 UP WITH A WAY OUT. HE KNEW HE WAS CAUGHT, BUT HE WASN'T READY TO GIVE IN
112 WITHOUT SOME CONCESSION FROM FIN. THERE HAD TO BE AN ANSWER. HE HAD TO
113 STALL FOR TIME."LET ME THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?" FIN SMILED, "BUT OF COURSE,
114 OF COURSE!! I WOULDN'T DREAM OF COERCING YOU INTO SOMETHING YOU DON'T
115 WISH TO DO, JUST BE READY TO GO BY 7 TOMORROW MORNING. NOW I REALLY MUST
116 BE GOING, MUCH TO AND SO LITTLE TIME TO DO IT IN!" AND WITH THAT HE MADE
117 READY TO EXIT, "OH AND ONE OTHER THING: THE FLIGHT DECK HAS BEEN BRIEFED
118 AND THE TRANSPORTER OFFICE NOTIFIED THAT YOU ARE ON A TEMPORARY VISA HOLD
119 JUST IN CASE YOU FELT THE URGE TO GO ON A JAUNT" HE SMILED ONCE MORE AND
120 LEFT, WITH LASETER WATCHING HIS BACK. A VERY DARK MOOD DESCENDED UPON HIM.

123 Sob! All the great works form drive B gone! I think I'll cry.
124 Voyeur: I'll be coming to the PorSFiS meeting form Cedar Mill. Maybe I
125 could pick up your sunglasses from Alex.
126 All: Anyone want to get in on the BW archive buy? I've got the $25 and am
127 prepared to fork it over Saturday. However, that money was going to buy
128 food being as I spent my archive money replacing a blown up engine. If
129 anyone can get the $25 to L'hommes by Saturday at the PorSFiS meeting, 
130 the've bought me out.

137 time I checked on engine rebuilds, they were in the price range of $750-$1000.

174 Well shtoner, your rebuttle was certainly in character. Complete
175 with misquotes, misspellings, and miseverything. You don't seem
176 to realize the content of your messages relagates you to one of
177 what the MiG character on the bulletin board calls a twit. The
178 public place where I posted your earlier messages was not computer-
179 ized, it was printed off and taped to the company notice board.
180 The comments from my fellow workers ranged from "Where did you get
181 this junk?", to "What grade level is this? 3? 4? 5?" As you can
182 see these are in biased opinions. These people obviously can have
183 no personal malice towards you, yet they said what they said. Can
184 you refute this evidence? Can you tell me with all honesty that
185 you knew what you were writing? And your comment about the first
186 message being entered at a party. I don't know about you, but 
187 when I went to a lot of parties in my late teens, the last thing
188 we did at them was screw around with computers. Will you dare
189 reply?

251 indeed posted or you are making this all up. Why don't you tell me where the 
252 commons board is, and what company?. Yes, I knew what I was writing, I wrote it!

255 Did you have easy access to computers when you were a teen?
256 If my last entry was in character, what would be out of character? that last 
257 message was as far out of character as I have ever been, trying to end an argument

296 McKane Industries with Wassir Toilet Plungers Inc.  A spokesman for 
297 WPT Inc, Henry M. Pinkstaff, stated; "This is essentially a bail-out
298 situation.  We believe that McKane Industries is a basically sound
299 company caught in a credit crunch arising from the rumors of Leroy
300 McKane's death.  This merger can only help both companys."  It is also
301 reported that the top management personnel of McKane Industries will

322 While L'homme and I were loitering around the NET branch
323 office, waiting for our audience with Ian, I browsed through a
324 copy of the OREGONIAN (Friday, July 27th, 1984) I found in the
325 library.  I was curious about what kind of things happen out
326 there in the sticks.  Sure enough, right there on page C3 was
327 a picture and article about pigs at a county fair.  Jeez, the
328 yokels probably didn't even know about the death of McKane!
329 Then another article on the same page caught my eye:
330 
331   `HOT' MERCURY FEARED STOLEN
332 
333 RICHLAND, Wash. -- Five plastic quart containers of used
334 and radioactive mercury are missing from the Hanford Nuclear
335 Reservation and may have been stolen, UNC Nuclear Industries
336 said Thursday.
337 The company reported the missing containers to the U.S.
338 Department of Energy and said the poisonous mercury was
339 "missing and suspected stolen and probably removed from the
340 Hanford site."
341 
342 "Well, L'homme, looks like we know where the mercury
343 came from for McKane's lethal thermometer.  If Ian doesn't have
344 anything for us, maybe we should check it out."
345 L'homme thought, then commented, "I doubt that we are the only
346 ones to make the connection.  We'd probably be fighting the FBI,
347 the CIA, and every other acronym for details on the story.
348 Personally, I'd rather go after that (expletivew deleted)
349 Petrov!"
350 I shrugged and sat back to finish the article, while
351 wondering what info Ian might have for us in the upcoming meeting.

361 ETER". THIS RUMOR WAS STARTED BY AN AGENCY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT R REASONS I DON'T KNOW. THE REAL CAUSE OF HIS DEATH
362 WAS, IN FACT, PERITONITIS, FROM A COLON INFECTION, HOWEVER- THE
363 CAUSE OF THE INFECTION WAS THE RESULT OF A CENTURIES OLD 
364 CHINESE ASSASINATION METHOD. THE KILLER COILS UP SMALL BAMBOO SHOOTS, AND TIES THEM WITH A
365 PIECE OF SILK THREAD, AND THEN PLACES THEM INSIDE CHUNKS OF
366 SWEET AND SOUR PORK. WHEN THE SILK DISSOLVES IN THE DIGESTIVE 
367 SYSTEM, THE BAMBOO STRAIGHTENS OUT, AND CAUSES TINY PUNCTURES THROUGHOUT THE LARGE INTESTINE.
368 THE RESULT IS, OF COURSE, PERITONITIS, AND IS A SLOW AND
369 EXTREMELY PAINFUL WAY TO DIE. RUMORS ARE THAT SOMEONE WHO WAS EMPLOYED IN A LOCAL RESTAURANT PLACED THE BAMBOO IN MCKANE
370 S FOOD.HOPE THIS IS USEFUL TO YOU. A FRIEND

405 Those who made fun of my car: I have a '75 Fiat (Fix it again Tony) 124
406 sports coup. I lost two pistons and the head. Luckily, I have a
407 brother who is a mechanic at freeway FIAT and got me parts at cost.
408 after his fees, it cost me $400 to fix my car. Anyway, I had to dip
409 into the archive money as well as any other money that was handy.

417 Rocky seemed unaware that with Wassir's arms shipment and the
418 key to the stocks, he had a lot of power. All he could think
419 about was disguises for his meeting with this brother. The 
420 more I watched him and listened to his exotic voice the more
421 I thought, "he can't possibly be a criminal.  His attention
422 span is too short."  I had to get him to throw his resources
423 to the good guys.  But who WERE the good guys?
424 PREMISES:
425 1.  Most NET agents are good guys.
426 2.  Petrov is a NET agent some of the time.
427 3.  Joshua and L'homme are NET agents all of the time.
428 4.  That Wassir is a terrorist is true.
429 5.  All terrorists are not good guys.
430 6.  All good guys are not bad.
431 7.  Rocky's not bad at all in his soccer player disguise.
432 8.  You can fool some Albanians all of the time.
433 9.  All NET agents are mortal.
434 CONCLUSIONS:
435 Wassir is for sure a bad guy & maybe sometimes Petrov, but
436 probably not L'homme & Joshua but you never can tell & Rocky
437 mostly just does whatever he feels like.
438 I decided to abandon logic and rely on my gut instincts and
439 rapier wit.  I got Rocky to disguise himself as a stockbroker
440 and we headed over to the Plaza.  I was hoping to find a way
441 to get Rocky's assets into the right hands before Hon. M.
442 got to them and gave them to some ego-maniac with no morals.
443 With any luck at all, Petrov would turn out to be an ego-maniac
444 with a conscience.

448 "Be seated gentlemen." Ian had the type of voice that could bring wild dogs to their knees. When Ian spoke, most of
449 NET listened.
450 Present at the meeting was myself, Joshua, Ian, NET 06, who's real name turns out to be Gregory, NET 03, our
451 phone company agent, and an unidentified woman. As we took our seats, Ian flipped a switch on the arm of his chair,
452 causing the lights to go out, a screen to appear, and a projector to come to life.
453 "The files you see before you contain pertinent information regarding the entire Mckane operation. Everything remotely
454 involving this case has been gathered, compiled, cross-compiled, and interpreted. These files should be
455 memorized and understood down to the last iota of information. These slides contain germane information just received by
456 outside NET operatives. Please read and memorize everything very carefully while I elaborate." Ian removed a paper
457 from a special folder, and with the aid of a small flashlight, read to us its contents.
458 "With our blessings, Bunker Hunt delivered his speech to the SBAC, and as we expected, the Dow Jones went through the
459 roof. It might interest you to know that the NET made 700 million on the deal. WE have contacted the SEC, and are
460 putting friendly but firm pressure on them to nix the possible merger deal between McKane and the albanian toilet
461 interest. We have managed to secure photographs of Rocky entertaining known McKane agents, and are closing in on tieing
462 up that loose end."
463 In the dim light, I could see Joshua's face cringe at the end of Ian's latest revelation.
464 "We are also in the process of securing very damaging papers regarding the McKane organization from a disgruntled former
465 employee."
466 The lights came back on and the screen returned to its hiding place in the wall."And now for the assignments"
467 This is the part I always dreaded the most. What would it be this time? Beruit to look for stolen Holiday Inn towels?
468 Canada to look for missing beer? Or maybe Cincinatti to look for missing hitting? What ever it was, I dreaded it with
469 every bone in my body.
470 "NET 03, you return to the phone company, and keep those taps going. You are a prime source of information. NET 06,
471 you are headed for Tripoli. I want you to find out more about this Albanian character Wassir. And this time don't let
472 your brother-in-law get the best of you! L'homme, Joshua, for you I save the best. I want both of you to head up to
473 Oregon.
474 "Oregon?", I ask. "You mean the land of whoop whoop and rust?"
475 "The same.", continued Ian, without missing a beat. "Our information shows that Oregon contains the largest and most
476 important circle of prayer facility in the country. We need to neutralize this religious enterprise ASAP. Your target
477 is a guru named Rajneesh Dangerfield. A man who claims to get no respect, but don't let it fool you. You will find
478 the commune in the city of RAINdeer. The rest of the information is in your folders. By the way, your car was impounded
479 by the city, but we have recovered it. It is waiting in the garage. You will find a nice surprise for you concerning
480 the speed and handling of the car. I suggest you drive to Oregon. You will make it in 1 day, I assure you."
481 "What about her...", I asked, and was just as abrubtly cut off by Ian.
482 "Don't concern yourself. Now off you go. And don't forget the new comset code!"
483 Joshua and I headed for the garage, where according to Ada, our baggage and weapons were waiting for us in the trunk.
484 "Have fun", she winked as we left the main floor of the complex.
485 "Yea...fun..." I thought, as we made our way to the start of our next mission.

502 THE LAKE WAS MUCH WIDER THAN IT WAS WAS LONG, ANS AS SEEN FROM THE 
503 ISTANCE, DECEPTIVELY SO. NOW, AS I SAT ON MY ROCK, WITH THE WAVES L
504 LAPPING AT MY FEET, I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT CROSSING IT WAS NOT GOI
505 NG TO BE AS EASY AS I HAD THOUGHT. I COULD SWIM IT EASILY ENOUGH, 
506 BUT THE MAP WOULD BE RUINED FROM HOURS IN THE WATER. AND WHAT OF MY
507 COMPANION? COULD A RACCOON SWIM SUCH A DISTANCE, COULD HE SWIM AT 
508 ALL? THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING HIM BEHIND SADDENED ME, AS I HAD BOCOME
509 VERY FOND OF HIM- THE WAY HE YAWNED AT ME, JUST AS I REALIZED IT 
510 WAS TIME TO GET GOING, AND THE WAY HE CAVORTED PLAYFULLY ABOUT IN 
511 THE MEADOW, CHASING BUTTERFLIES----. THEN, SUDDENLY, MY FATHERS 
512 WORDS ECHOED FROM OUT OF THE PAST, AND A GRIM DETERMINATION SET IT.
513 I MUST NOT FAIL.IT WAS TIME TO GET GOING. AS I STARTED TO RISE I 
514 SAW A WATER SKATE SCAMPERING ACROSS THE STILL SURFACE OF A TINY 
515 POOL, CAUGHT BETWEEN THE ROCKS. HOW I ENVIED HIS ABILITY TO WALK 
516 ACROSS THE WATER. A CURLED LEAF BOBBED UP AND DOWN AT THE EDGE OF 
517 'MY' ROCK. AN ANT WAS CRAWLING BACK AND FORTH-TRAPPED, I THOUGHT, 
518 SEEKING A WAY OUT, AND SUDDENLY A PICTURE APPEARED IN MY MIND. I 
519 SPRANG UP FROM MY ROCK, AND RAN ALONG THE ROCKY SHORE TO WHERE THE 
520 BULLRUSHES GREW. REEDS! I COULD BUILD A LITTLE RAFT, TO HOLD THE 
521 BOOK, AND MY COMPANION TOO! I SET ABOUT MY TASK WITH GREAT 
522 ENTHUSIASM, AND SOON IT WAS COMPLETED. I LEFT MY LITTLE CAMP AS IT 
523 WAS, AND PLACING MY RUCKSACK, AND CLOTHES ON THE RAFT, AND LASTLY 
524 MY COMPANION, WHO DIDN'T SEEM TO DISTURBED AT ALL. THEN I SLIPPED 
525 INTO THE COOL WATER, AND PUSHED AWAY FROM THE EDGE. HOW STRANGE 
526 THIS MUST APPEAR, I THOUGHT, BUT IT WOULD WORK, AND, ONCE AGAIN, 
527 WE WERE ON OUR WAY. 2BCONT'D[*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*]

529 Mr. Haflinger - I read your book last night (All of it!).  I think
530 I see why you like it. You identify with the hero, don't you?
531 You also envy his abilities with computers.  Yes, I definitely
532 see similarities between you and him.
533 If I see you in the near future, we can discuss this further.

536 LeRoy: Everything is going as anticipated. Hunt is satisfied 
537 with your plan. The speech went very well and he's about to 
538 cash in. The NET was thrown into total confusion; they're just 
539 now starting to recover. The SEC chairman has been taken care 
540 of and the merger is assured. Everything is going like 
541 clockwork, no serious difficulties in sight. Monsieur d'Autun
