116 Voyeur: I must take credit for the proper alignment of control characters. When I edited the *original* disk to take car
117 e of the ma 128 Destroyer markers, I fixed the EOL chars at the same time. As long as Mikey continues to give me the
118 archive disks, I can continue, if you wish, changing the sequence, and thus, simplify your program. Thanks for the stuff
119 the other night. Also, it appears my 1.5meg memory board was also responsible for the lock-ups. I took the board out
120 and have not had any problems since. Of course now I am down to a mere meg-o-ram. :-)

134 I hate to make unfortunate accusations and unjustified generalizations.  But
135 I still notice that in general, the shorter the line width of a person's
136 comments, the less intelligence contained in the message.  Maybe it's because
137 the smarter a person is, the less likely he is to buy a computer whose line
138 length tends to be limited.

141 I LOVE TO MAKE ACCUSATIONS.
142 I LOVE TO MAKE GENERALIZATIONS.
143 THE PERSON ABOVE IS AN IDIOT.  A PERSON USUALLY BUYS A COMPUTER BASED ON THE
144 PRICE, NOT LINE LENGTH.
145 I ONCE OWNED A VIC-20.  I BOUGHT IT WHENIT COST $250.  I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE
146 IT WAS IN A PRICE RANGE THAT I COULD AFFORD, NOT BECAUSE IT WAS 24 LINES.
147 I NOW OWN AN APPLE.  I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I COULD AFFORD IT. NOT BECAUSE IT
148 IS 40 LINES.
149  
150  IF I BUY 24 LINES BECAUSE IT'S ALL I CAN AFFORD I AM NOT STUPID, I JUST DON'T
151 LIKHAVE THE MONEY.  IF I BUY 40 LINES BECAUSE I CAN AFFORD IT THAT DOES NOT
152 MEAN I AM SMART.
153  AS FOR THE PERSON ABOVE, DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU ARE NOT
154 THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE WORLD AND YOU NEVER WILL BE.

179 Piper:  'scuse me for buttin' in, but I don't think that you missed anything,
180   really.  As you mentioned, the s/n has been unusual for quite a while, and
181   I think that it's been inhibiting almost everything "normal".
182 DeltaV: You seem to be liquidating lot's of interesting stuff.  Are you
183   upgrading?

196 Ace Master: It's "columns", not lines. And the low price computers tend to
197 attract the "kids". Since it was *stated* that he was making a generaliz-
198 ation, why take it personally?
199 You might try using lowercase.  All caps is another thing that many times
200 signals the presence of someone who doesn't really know what they are doing
201 (it is also much more easily read & makes a better impression) If your
202 equipment can't do lowercase... well we all have problems....

219    If, perchance, you really did mean lines, you still are incorrect.  The VIC
220 screen is 22X23.  How you get 24 out of that, I don't know.  Perhaps I'm wrong
221 this time...
222    Anyway, if you have an apple, why don't you spend $60 (or so...) and buy an
223 80-col card.

456 Sigh....... Where are the twit boards when you need them?
457 It would seem to me that BW has been deteriorating for some time.
458 Is it perhaps a sign of the times? Maybe the intellegent users have
459 grown tired of this form of communication and desire something more.
460 Or perhaps they have evoled into a higher life form. Or maybe it is
461 just that BW has been taken over by lower life forms? Life was so
462 much simpler when it cost at least $1000-$2000 to even get into this
463 stuff. Such is life I guess. But I do miss being able to log onto BW
464 and not have to sift through most of a disk of immature mindless drivel
465 just to catch a glimps of an entry by an author I enjoy seeing.
466 But to those users who complain such as I, I do have a message. It is
467 a saying that comes from the amature radio folks. Use it or lose it.
468 If you don't write, others will use the system for themselves. 
469 There is a contining pressure out there for the resource of systems
470 like BW. If you want to see the quality of BW improve, there is only 
471 one way, and that is for YOU to improve it. No one else is going to.
472 Instead of lurking write something. Just a line or two. It doesn't take
473 anymore time then to not do anything, and it is a start. I will try,
474 will you?

481      Go home; my emotions tell me, go home.  But I cannot.  There 
482 is no home to go to.  It is not that the bridge is burned, only 
483 that what I once called home no longer is.  My past is the past, 
484 I cannot make things what they once were. 
485      I've traveled the new paths, the side roads and cow trails. 
486 I've fought through the brambles and bushes, underbrush choking 
487 the forests.  It is hard and tedious.  It is work.  But the 
488 beauty, the wonder of the freedom, the knowledge that others have 
489 not tread this way, seeing things others cannot because they are 
490 unwilling to travel thus.  These are the things I remember.  The 
491 dirt and grime, the cuts and bruises, the torn clothing, all of 
492 this is nothing when compared to the grandure of what I 
493 experience. 
494      But the time has come when I cannot continue go in the 
495 direction I have been going.  My traveling companion wishes to 
496 take the high road, and I wish the low.  We cannot find a middle 
497 ground, so we must part ways.  I leave him the food, and I take 
498 my tools. 
499      A convient road is come across, and I use it as the 
500 oportunity to leave.  It makes my traveling easy for a while.  
501 But, I quickly find the way hard.  The hard unyealing surface 
502 soon leaves me sore and irritated.  The scenery is monotonous.  
503 The dark black ribbon always ahead of me.  The gentleman that 
504 offered me a ride is gruff and an angered soul.  The fumes and 
505 noise insult my senses.  I will get out at the next chance, as I 
506 would rather travel alone then be subjected thus. 
507      Each passing trail calls out invitingly as we pass it.  Yes, 
508 I will be leaving on my own again soon.  To revel in the gentle 
509 sounds of the forests and glades.  To hear the happy sound of 
510 birds calling.  To feel the cool brisk rushing water of a 
511 mountain stream.  To lay in the comfortig arms of a lush green 
512 meadow and watch the playful clouds chase each other across the 
513 clear blue sky.  I miss the magnificence of the rainbow after a 
514 spring shower.  The sharp crisp clean air.  Yes, I'll be moving 
515 on my own again soon.

616 As we all know, there are an infinite number of Real values between any two
617 integers. Therefore, the probability of picking any one of these numbers is
618 1 / infinity, which is zero. Ay, there's the rub, since it is easy to pick a
619 Real number between any two integers. A probability of zero means the action
620 can't happen, yet it DOES happen. What is wrong with the above reasoning? How
621 can the problem be correctly stated?

624 I know, I know, one should not feel their life has value based on someone else.
625 I realize that I should not live my life in the service of or for someone else.
626 I thought I was my own person, made better and fuller by the company of someone
627 else. I now know that I am not strong enough to live fully by these ideals. I
628 miss the companionship that another gives. I miss it enough to cause me to
629 forget the beliefs I have always felt so strong for. It's tough to be alone.
