76 To CISTOP Mikey and all:
77 Subject: Things aren't always as they seem.
78  The statement awhile back that it isn't possible/
79 is very difficult to handle continuous serial input during
80 disk access got me thinking.  (When anyone says something
81 is impossible, I can't resist not only doing it, but make 
82 it look easy.)
83  The solution requires NO hardware modification
84 on essentially any computer with a 1771 or 1791.  In case
85 you have never written drivers for these chips, ignore this
86 letter, as it will be relatively unintelligible.
87 
88  SOLUTION:
89 When a sector write is requested, give the controller commands
90 to do the write, then poll both the serial chip and 1771 to
91 see which asks for service first.  Between the time the 1771
92 asks for the first data byte and the time it MUST have it iss
93 actually 8 byte-times, or 512 microseconds using single-density
94 minifloppies.  It would be easy to write a routine to stack
95 serial bytes in this time.  So even if a serial byte came in
96 just before the 1771 needed service, everything would be ok.
97 Since there is only an 11 millisec delay for the actual 
98 transfer, no serial bytes could be lost during the disk access.
99 
100 A sector read is more complicated, due to the fact that the 1771
101 gives no advance warning of the availability of a byte.  However,
102 you still have close to 64 usec to handle it.  Do it the same as
103 the sector write above, except that if a serial byte is handled
104 just before the 1771 needs service, the 1771 won't be able to
105 transfer the data (it won't be serviced).  In that case, the
106 LOST DATA status bit will be set, and the software need only run
107 the read sector command again at the next revolution of the disk.
108 Statistically, this mis-read will occur about 0.1% of the time
109 if the software is written correctly, but this misread will 
110 always be detected and is always recoverable.
111 
112 Conclusion:
113  The software described above isn't "simple," but certainly
114 doesn't qualify as un-doable.  Since it doesn't require
115 interrupts, DMA, wait-states, or anything else, most any system
116 could use it.
117  So why hasn't this been done before.  Maybe it has.  Then
118 again, I doubt it.  Most software seems to be written to just
119 barely do the job, not anything else.  Also, most disk drivers
120 are clones of each other, with little imagination.  Anyway, if
121 any of you out there understand this, let's hear from you.
122 *********************************************************
123 I am not unaware of the afore mentioned technic, and in fact it can
124 be made to work in 'casual' type applications (I would say that this
125 system is probably a good candidate for that catagory). However, in
126 more intense applications a problem occurs: Communications has a very
127 interesting characteristic, it is VERY time dependant. You don't realize
128 the full extent of the implications of that statement until you've been
129 programing communications software for a few years. One major problem
130 that most who delve into this mess find difficult to understatnd
131 is that although the percentages of when something can go wrong seem
132 to be small and therefore easily handlable via recovery technics.
133 The problem is that things tend to run in patterns. That is that once
134 something happens it has a tendancy to repeat itself far more often
135 then it should by the laws of chance. Take for instance the above 
136 problem with the 1771 servicing. (By the way it is not possible
137 to service a 1791 via status on a 2Mhz 8080/Z80 there is insufficient
138 time available, it has to be done via interupts or DMA.) The problem
139 is that the 5 inch disk drive is spun with a DC motor that is very
140 closly regulated (Better then 1%) in speed. What we have found to
141 happen is that if the incoming data steam occurs such that it hits
142 while the 1771 is trying to get service, the problem will stay as 
143 the incomming data is also very closly controled in its speed. 
144 (usaaly with a crystal). Once the two match up it tends to take
145 a while before they fall out of sync again. As such once the problem
146 occurs it tends to stick around for a bit. If you have some monsterous
147 disk ques this can be lived with since they will sooner or later
148 fall out of sync and the disk can be serviced. We found that it 
149 a whole bunch simpler to just go use the interrupt servicing for the
150 disk instead as it worked correctly to begin with.
151 I do however use the status check in other things. My homebrew computer
152 that I use uses this method under CPM. The status loop used is as follows:
153 WRLOP  MOV A,M!CMA!OUT DDATA!INX H
154 WRITE  IN DSTAT!RAR!RAR!JNC WRLOP
155        RAL!JNC WRITE
156        RET
157 
158 RDLOP  IN DDATA!CMA!MOV M,A!INX H
159 READ   IN DSTAT!RAR!RAR!JNC RDLOP
160        RAL!JNC READ
161        RET
162 Notice the CMA because of the inverted data put out by the 1771.
163 Be carfull when calculating the time to service, as the worst
164 case time must be calculated. That means a double pass though
165 the loop assuming status came true just after the first status check.
166 Also the 1771 must be serviced within 48 usec after the data ready
167 flag goes on or things will get lost. Even though the thruput is
168 at 64usec. Finally disk drives do not put out data at exactly 64usec,
169 but rather tend to drift a few Usec around it, so the time loop has to
170 acount for the min short time at 5% drift this is about 60usec min time.
171 Anybody else have thoughts along these lines about controler software?
172 **** The never to be forgiven CISTOP MIKEY **** 25 nov 82 *******
190 Yak, yak, yak. You should all be ashamed of yourselves! There ain't
191 no such thing as a "better" language--the whole thing is dependent
192 on 1.) the programmer, 2.) the application, and 3.) circumstances.
193 There are great programs written in any language you care to name,
194 and there are just as many garbage programs. YOUR choice hinges on
195 YOUR needs and YOUR idiosyncracies--I'll handle my choice my way,
196 thank you. Are apples "better" than bananas? I'll bet some of you
197 would be prepared to give an answer. . . .
204 
205 Language choices are based on personal comfort and ease (let's
206 ignore the dictates of employers here); what's available, what fits
207 with the system, how good the documentation is, how easy the words
208 are for the programmer to grasp or the recipient to read, etc., etc.,
209 etc. COBOL, bulky as it is, can be shown and explained readily to the
210 most violent technophobe (I learned it in '68, by the way, when there
211 was no such thing as a "personal computer."). BASIC, in all its forms,
212 is the best-documented "beginner's" language going; reference works
213 are even available at the most ordinary of bookstores. And so on and
214 so on--one can find a rationale to boost any language (or to knock it).
215 Why bother? Language X might have more features or power or portability
216 or whatever than language Y, but language Y might very well be the one
217 language one programmer finds easiest to use. I dare you to tell me
218 that X is better than Y for him. 
219 
220 Seems to me that any A-B comparison of languages that ignores all the
221 intangibles is essentially frivolous.
222 
223 Pooh.                             --Shapiro 11/24: Happy turkey!
224 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
230 WHAT SHAPIRIO SAID ABOVE...I AGREE!!
231 **********************************************************
232 Cmon, now, it isn't all that hard to eliminate most of the 
233 lost data, even with timing constraints.  (see message above)
234 First, it is quite unlikely that two passes over the dis
235 k data will occur without a correct read (writes are easy, due
236 to the warning).  If you really worry about getting too long
237 a queue of data due to an improbable event, do this:  If the
238 queue ever gets above a certain size, say 30 characters for
239 example (a full second of data), then simply start ignoring the
240 serial channel.  Sure, you'd lose data, but perhaps only once 
241 in 10,000 disk reads.  This is a lot better than now, where
242 each and every disk read causes the loss of serial data.  
243 Since the data isn't critical anyway, you wouldn't care if
244 once a year the first x character in someone's message got
245 leted, right?  Notice, however, that this would free up
246 hundreds of hours on this system over that year if people
247 pre-formed their messages.
248  The key here is to look for ways to do something, rather
249 than looking for reasons why it can't be done.

251 All the languages the same? -- Consider this:
252 All the other languages are simply programs
253 written in Assembly Language!!!!!!
254 ^****^*^*^*^***^*^***^*^**^**^^****^^^^^^^^^^^*******^***^*****^**^
255 That isn't really true.  Many languages have been written in some other
256 language (or even the same language on another machine).  Admittedly, they
257 all have to get translated eventually to a machine language object, but
258 that isn't assembly language.  And don't forget the existence of machines
259 whose "Assembly Language" is a high level language...

262 wherever this place is. (I know about the cable problems under the Wil-

264 to keep calling back until I get a clean line.  Would it do any good to 
265 complain?  And if so, to whom?  I live in NE Portland.  Any Ideas?

270 Yes, it can help to complain. 
271 Start with the repair service at xxx-xxxx.
272 the cable under the river should not have any effect on calls from
273 north Portland to the Oregon City exchange, as all these calls go
274 by way of carrier systems.
275 If I knew where you were calling from, it might be possible to find
276 the trouble, and fix it. (Like maybe a phone number)
277 If no one complains, it is assume service is perfect.

281 Hi Bell!  Nice talking to you.  I am calling from xxx-xxxx (no joke).
282 Will try the repair service next time it happens.  How does one explain
283 the wonders of telecommunications to repair people?  If the person is 
284 interested enough to call the number, he gets phunny noises, if he calls
285 back to tell of the phunny noises, he gets phunny noises.....

297 This talk about pushing a pre-written message onto the 
298 sytem ingnores one factor:
299 I (for one) never know what I'm going to say when I logon.
300 And it sometimes is very inconveinient to call back.
301 The system will definitly accept text as fast as I can type.
302 **********************************************************************
303 Please don't get me wrong, I am not saying that you idea's stink. In
304 fact, if anything they are fine. All I was trying to do was to let you
305 know that there were still some holes that needed to be filled in then
306 An interesting point was the loss you deem to be improbable, this is
307 actually not only probable, but does happen! I speek from experience
308 I have written, played with, and cursed at disk software since 1975.
309 I have also designed the hardware that the whole mish mash runs on.
310 While on a casual system like this it is perfectly aceptable to close
311 ones eyes to an occasional loss (after all who's to say that it might
312 be the phone line anyway?) but in business applications this is not
313 acceptable. Particularly since they don't go thru phone lines soemtimes
314 anyway, then what do you have it to blame on? As far as the mess in
315 refference to this system, It is rather moot anyway since I will not be
316 altering it anyway. Please note the much previous message about cost.
317 and I consider my time valuable, as such there has to be a very good 
318 reason for me to dig into a very touchy part of the software on this 
319 system. At any rate, As was indicated also in a very previous message.
320 It is possible to send a perpared message to this system by observing the
321 rules that govern it. That being to wait for each character you send to 
322 be echoed back to you and you will be assured of no loss. If you check
323 that the character is valid you can even be sure of get the message thru
324 even if the line is noisy since you can erase it and resend it.

347 Again, let us discuss languages. After hearing a lot of blather
348 about which language is !@#$%^&* bad, let's ask a question:
349 what do you really want in one? If none is perfect, let's design
350 one that is.
351    a few suggestions of mu own: compatible with existing ones (sorry,
352 this means BASIC), easy to learn (no strange semicolons at the end
353 of lines), expandable (user defined 'macros' that can then be used
354 as regular command

361 NO, ON MORE THEN ONE LINE MAY BE DELETED AT ONE TIME (THE LINE(S) DELETED
362 MESSAGE IS LEFT OVER FROM THE OLDER SOFTWARE WHICH I NEVER CHANGED.)
363 In regard to the phone line problems, I am really in a quandry (as opposed
364 to a quarry) as to what or where the problem is. I have not recently 
365 experienced this problem, but I have observed it occuring when others
366 use the system. When I listen to the signal when this is happening
367 I don't hear anything grossly bad. since everything from here to the
368 exchange is two wire, i should be able to hear any noises caused by
369 the defective line. Possibly the exchange has a bad hybrid that is
370 sometimes getting hooked into this line. It would be noisy, but many
371 poeple would accept it for voice, but of couse my poor ol' computer
372 would hate it. HOW ABOUT IT > PNB < WHAT IS YOUR DIAGNOSIS?
373 (For those of you who are not aware, PNB really is PBN nice to know
374 big brother (mother?) is watching huh? ha ha.)
375 I make the assumption of bad exchange equipment based on the info that
376 if they call back they can sometimes get a 'good' line. Is the switching
377 random? or does it tend to select the same lines if it can?
378 I generally call from two different phones xxx-xxxx (same exchange)
379 or xxx-xxxx (portland exchange) or yeah, also xxxxxxx or xxxxxxx which
380 although are diff lines, they run to the same location and exchange.
381 I have not encountered any problems per say recently that I can remember.

385 To add to general information bank on phone lines--no problems (none!) from
386 NW 222- exchange.
387 
388 Further thoughts on this language controversy blather: 1.) How would you 
389 all feel about some standardized vocabulary conventions for an extensible
390 language like (dare I say it?) FORTH or STOIC? Seems to me words would be
391 relatively easy to load, and could be defined either for beginners (using
392 BASIC terms even, Mikey) or for the unintelligible cryptic elegance freaks.
393 Seems to me that writing conventions would eliminate all the objections
394 that these languages are unreadable. 2.) Why not look at all this from the
395 perspective of what will be possible five years from now? We should be
396 able to get all the speed and memory our little hearts desire, and there
397 will be relatively little need for the low-level languages now in vogue,
398 except maybe for teaching theory. Super-high-level language chips are not
399 only possible but probable, and goodbye abstruse syntax. The pioneers only
400 used hand tools and horses because they couldn't get Stanleys and Moto
401 Guzzis. . . .      --Shapiro, again, post turkey, pre workweek

403 Thanks for the information.  I believe that there should definately be
404 several different languages...as there are many different experience levels
405 and many different uses for each one!  The current system isn't that bad!
406 We probably all agree that it could use some improvement(Along with the
407 phone lines!), but we *can* get alone with it.  I still haven't heard a
408 good idea that is foolproof.  We could develop a general all purpose
409 language, but that would have to be 128k alone!  Maybe we could narrow
410 the number of languages down and somehow get alittle continutity in them.
411 Maybe we could also narrow the file structures down and input and output
412 types too.  But afterall, the current system isn't that bad.

461 On second thought... since I own this system... I DO NOT HAVE SPEELING ERROS

466 Indeedy, one of the more heavily used langauges (particularly in the US)
467 is not only unstructured, but continuosly redefinable with new words beeing

497 I tell ya, I think we have all decided on what to do about the language
498 problem we have.  We cannot do anything about the phone lines, or about
499 Cist-op Mikey's spelling errors, so let's come up with a new topic??!!
500 I suggest maybe some good jokes?!  Anyone got any?  You know one other
501 thing that really irks me is that Vic Atiyeh is raising the taxes(After saying
502 he wouldn't) again.  They never learn(i.e. Ballot #3).  That just kills
504 me!  And then the good ole Gas Guys are out trying to put a 9 cent gas tax
505 on us.  Like(to be a Val)-I'm totally sure!  How bogus.  And we as
506 Tax payers have a lot of voice in things like that. We can yell and
507 holler all we want...we put ballots on the measure and someone always
508 finds something that *might* go wrong with them.  That kills me.
509 Sometimes the public can never win.  Half of us can never agree and
510 get something accomplished.  We elect people to represent us and they
511 raise our taxes for our good...how lovely and quaint.  I think I might
512 have to sell my terminal/computer and invest in this guy who thinks he
513 can invent a money tree ! ! ! !
514      Happy spending(and tax time
515      again...)
516       Rick
517 Maybe somebody can give our government the boot...to cut the defict in a nice
518 manner...

521 *******************************************************************
522 My original comments concerning loss of character at the beginning
523 of the line in auto-send mode was not specifically directed at this
524 system (In fact, I've never tried it on this system (didn't expect
525 it would work anyway)).  My intention wasn't to change existing
526 software or hardware, but to remind someone who may be building
527 a bbs someday that there are certain capabilities that a bbs 
528 should have that aren't necessarily obvious now.  It's a lot easier
529 to do it right the first time, rather than retro-fit a patch to
530 existing software.  In fact, I suggest you don't change this 
531 system:  It serves it's purpose.  The time required to change it
532 would be better spent on a totally new system anyway.  
533  Perhaps we should generate a Christmas wish list for 
534 bbs's:  What do we want in them?  Perhaps an easy form of
535 autologon, etc.  Hardware capabilities are increasing all the time.
536 Why waste them on incomplete software?  
537 
538 (P.S. Waiting for a sent character to echo has its own problems:
539 What about glitches?  Also, I called a BBS in Boston.  The signal
540 took about .5 seconds to echo, which would translate to a baud rate
541 of 20 baud if the software wasn't very smart.  Normally you'd 
542 never see these delays if you only called local systems.......
543 I use modem7 as a terminal emulator:  It accepts CTRL-S and CTRL-Q
544 as X-ON and X-OFF (which is an accepted standard)  How about telling
545 the connecting system to stop sending characters with CTRL-S if an
546 unusual delay was about to occur? (such as a disk access, etc.)
547 )
548 **********************************************************
549 Jokes he says? and then talks about taxes?
550 Please, no swearing on this system.
551 
552 Waiting for a charactor to echo does not necessarily mean 20 baud
553 on a 1/2 second line: you can speed that up if the line is fairly
554 good by only waiting after each line, and only correcting the lines
555 that are bad. Note also, that the best method for one medium such
556 as local phone lines is not usually the best for another, such as
557 satelite lines, or something like say a disc or casette tape. 
558 A long haul call is inherently expensive, so an expensive but fast
559 and accurate protocal is correct, but an elaborate method is not
560 appropriate on a system using less expensive media, and used by
561 unskilled people, or by those of us who have widely differing systems.
562 But don't assume ctrl-S & -Q are exactly standard. We also have to deal
563 with another "standard": ACK-NACK, as well as several escape sequences.
564 There can be no "standard" BBS, because it has already been defined,
565 unfortunately, in several different ways; therefore all standards must
566 conflict with all others. (And these others already exist!!)
567 
568 As to getting another line between where ever you are and this system:
569 from ESS (computer controlled) offices, you get a randomly selected,
570 different trunk each time. (Actually, ESS uses a linked list, and you get
571 whichever trunk has been idle the longest.) From most of the other, older
572 systems such as SXS, you will usually get the same one again, because
573 they select trunks from a list of most to least preferred. Unless someone
574 else gets the bad one, you get it next time.
575 a few ESS exhanges: 656,657,655;282,284,285,286;222,241;224,242;232,238.
576 a few SXS or XBAR: 252,253;255,256;760,761,281,283
577 Gresham and Beaverton are not Ma Bell, but are GTE and are mostly what
578 they call EAX: this is also computerized. Most noises are in the trunks
579 between exchanges, because these are the longest runs.
580 If you can not talk with this system, listen to the line, and then call
581 repair service and complain: but be sure to tell them what is wrong,
582 however you are then talking only to a (usually rather dumb) clerk,
583 so be explicit in your complaint: cross-talk, noise, hissing, distortion,
584 clicks, "down in the mud". The phone system is designed to talk on, so
585 don't expect perfect data, however data is becoming more common and the 
586 design is starting to include it.

603 Tom my man,
604 What is up with you?  Haven't been around lately.  I saw you tried Talk
605 but that was the last of you.  What have you been doing on the computer?
606 Been on any timesharing system?  We are really into apple software now,
607 so not much RSTS/E is going on.  I do monitor my account however.  Are you
608 ever allowed to log-on.  You should put ACU on another account...althought,
609 our generation is somewhat gone on that system!  Oh well, I still got TALK..
610 Anyway, later...
