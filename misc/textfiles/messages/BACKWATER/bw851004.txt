21 Everybody: well, ecuuuuse me! I'm not exactly a NEW writer, actually I've
22 been here several months. I thought I knew this place but maybe not. Nobody
23 has ever stated any rules about the inn and I have seen very few stories
24 taking place in there so I pretty much thought that I had a free reign whe it
25 came to my story. My mistake. Not to worry, though, because as of the next
26 entry I shall be leaving and will no longer be such a pain in the ass. 
27 You know, it's strange... I got almost exactly the same reception on
28 Tanis when I started my story there. Maybe everybody's trying to tell me
29 something. Oh, well, I shall return soon with my next entry and the Destroyer
30 and the inn shall be quits. By the way, does anybody acually LIKE my stuff
31 or am I just wasting space?
32 By the way (Part II): AT THE TOP!
33 (A pointless but nearly mandatory ritual. At least I got that right.)

35 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\THE DESTROYER\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
36    The stars winked down at them, cold, uncaring. The drunks dragged Tariya towards the woods, where they could party
37 in private. They were stoped for a second by the sound of a loud muffled BOOM from the direction of the inn. There was
38 another, then a blast much louder than the first two. Then silence.
39    Deciding it had nothing to do with them, the drunks continued about their business. When they finally got out of
40 sight of the public, one clapped a filthy hand over Tariya's mouth. A long, nasty stilletto was in his other hand.
41 "You be quiet or I'll cut your throat and we'll still do it to you, anyway. Then you won't never see your boyfriend
42 again."
43    After letting his hand up, she snarled, "He's not my boyfriend, he's a bastard just like YOU!" and she suddenly
44 jabbed two stiffened fingers into the thugs eyes.
45    The drunk dropped his knife and howled, clawing at the bloddy sockets. He stumbled into his buddies, screaming for
46 somebody to turn the lights back on. Another one managed to grab both her arms from in front and yell, "All right
47 bitch, you're dead meat!"
48    His mistake was grabbing her from the front. Her knee shot up and landed squarely in his crotch. He turned slightly
49 green and landed on the ground, moaning. Rape suddenly became the last thing on his mind. In fact, a life of celibacy
50 looked real good right now.
51    Unfortunately, the last two drunks were alert now. They stayed on each side, circling just beyond her reach. The
52 element of surprise was lost now, and she was really scared. There was slow murder in their eyes. She knew half a
53 hundred spells for just such occasions but for the life of her she couldn't remember one of them. One of the drunks
54 said, "Let's rush her. And don't be gentle!"
55    Before anybody could move, though, the whole area was suddenly lit up like a strobe. An unbelievable clap of
56 thunder hammered their ears and something struck one of the drunks full in the chest hard enough to knock him clean
57 out of his shoes. He landed ten feet behind them and didn't move again.
58    "What the hell kind of witchcraft be this-" The last drunk was suddenly cut off as Tariya's boot slammed into his
59 chin hard enough to shatter his jaw. The pain was so intense that he was unconcious before he hit the ground.
60    Though her ears were still ringing she could here the blind drunk crashing around in the woods somewhere. She went
61 over towards the thug that had been mysteriously knocked down. She thougt that maybe lightning had gotten
62 him.
63    Suddenly a familar voice said, "I dunno if you wanna look at that." James stepped out from the shadows. In his hand
64 was a large smoking gun. She'd seen guns before, but nothing like this one. It looked like a 1896 Broomhandle Mauser,
65 but it had been heavily modified and had a huge bore. "A .454 Casull pushing a 210 grain Hydroshok slug leaves an
66 ENORMOUS hole. Prob'ly cut him damn near in half."
67    The adrenaline rush was wearing off and she began to shiver violently. Her thoat began to ache and tears stung her
68 eyes. James holstered his pistol and went over to her. "Y'did good, though. So tell me, How did'ja like your first
69 taste of danger."
70    He shouldn't have been surprised by her reply, but was anyway. Therefore, when the roundhouse left she threw
71 connected with his jaw, he dropped like a stone.
72    The Destroyer still had a lot to learn about people.
73 
74 (Just a thought: Maybe this isn't THE inn. I went over previous chapters and saw nothing that absolutely says it has
75 to be. Maybe Trainor hit a couple of other places also looking for adventurers. If it makes you feel better, then say
76 that this is some other inn. Doesn't bother me.)

79 ( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )( )
80 Actually, Destroyer, your story is better than many here.  As has already been pointed
81 out to you, there are certain (unfortunately unspoken) rules about the Inn itself.
82 The oldtimers know them, but relative novices don't, until they unwittingly cross
83 them.  Then, of course, they are unmercifully jumped on by the outraged oldsters,
84 and most then depart 'in tears', and/or in disgust.
85 To keep the conservatives happy, the Inn is essentially a place for story telling.
86 You might think of it as the beginning of every story. "The calm of the Inn was 
87 broken by the crashing open of the scarred oaken doors.  A large, worse-for-wear
88 stranger paused in the doorway, then made his way to the long, stained counter.
89 Receiving his requested drink, he approached the table near the fire, and at a
90 friendly gesture from one of the patrons, seated himself near the flames.
91 As he nursed his drink and absorbed the heat from the fire, his ragged appearance
92 invoked curious questions from his table-mates.  After gathering his thoughts,
93 he launched into his tale....."
94 The general idea of the Inn is a safe place to relax while between adventures, 
95 or, when BackWater is into discussions, that might be the site for the debaters.
96 Once upon a time, some over-zealous beginner caused and invasion of the Inn itself
97 by overgrown (man-sized) ants, which were then fought by high-tech weapons.
98 The CISTOP put his foot down at that one, as he didn't like his tavern so destroyed.
99 So, feel free to continue your story at AN inn, not THE Inn.  I, for one,
100 am interested to see more of it.
101    +Dante-

103 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
104 +Dante-: Thank you. I saw the inn as a place to start my adventure, not as a place to rest (This same stunt got me no
105 end of grief over at Tanis). I had no idea I was being so unoriginal, though. I guess I better start working towards 
106 something better. Point taken, though. I am leaving the GENERIC inn so hopefully the whole argument is rendered moot, 
107 though. Thank you for the kind words, though. After reading drive B I needed them.

114 Main problems: token violence. Too long. Writing is pretty good, but more unpredictability helps.

119 To other new writer (horse story)
120 
121 You mentioned that you wanted constructive critism. As I am a professional writer (which doesn't mean better, it just
122 means someone pays more for it), I felt inclined to give you the following suggestions:
123 Remember that you're writing for other people, not just yourself (that is if you publish it; i.e. this board). Horse stories
124 like you started out are nice, but there was no  "hook," no reason to compel the readers to continue on. In a short short 
125 story (which is all they should be on a computer board) you have to plunge in immediately and create an interesting
126 character or situation. Neither was in your story.
127 Also, don't be too sensitive about your writings. The prankster was making a point, comic relief was needed. There isn't a
128 writer in the world who doesn't rewrite his material perhaps dozens of times. And there are jillions of stories that start 
129 out with a fine idea, but need to be shelved because they just don't work, or aren't interesting enough.
130 Also, don't try and speak above yourself. Stay within your realm. In other words, if you're going to use words that SOUND
131 big, but you don't have command of them (i.e. becon call should have been "beck and call"), your writing will seem much
132 more amateurish. Stay natural, simple, conversation, interesting. Put in a HOOK.Be funny, exciting, novel, whatever.
133 But most of all, remember that you're writing to be READ, not just for yourself. Keep it up! It can be fun... but to be 
134 really good, it's 2% inspiration, 98% perspiriation....
135 
136 Just yell if you'd like more help!
137 Mikey:
138 Controversy is raging... you are the GOD of this board... give your opinion on the use of it? Too many stories? Not enough
139 controversy? 
140 The stories are too long and boring in my book, perhaps some guidelines (Not RULES God forbid, just your idea) would be app-
141 reciated by all.
142 Hello hello????
143 
144 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
145 MACF --- UNITE !!!!!
146 :-)(-:
147 Destroyer: I apoligize for the drunks, but I hadn't realized they were part
148 of your story.
149 Critics, rule-quoters & other low-lifes: Piper took the proper approach. He
150 took the writer aside and explained about the 'rules' which had been 
151 *unintentionally* broken. The three or four UNSIGNED critics who jumped in
152 with both feet are trying to drive away any 'new' (read 'unknown to them')
153 writers. That may not be their intent, but it is certainly the effect!
154 This is a PUBLIC board. Don't treat it like your own private property. Be
155 polite. This is even MORE necessary if you are 'correcting' someone.
156 As I recall, "hi-tech" weapons are not forbidden, their USE is heavily
157 frowned upon. Everyone who has here at the time has painful memories of
158 both the giant ant incident and even more painful ones of the Bolo incident
159 (Nuclear weapons!!??)
160 ...............................the apprentice..............................
161 ps. we have had fights at the Inn, but we try to keep the weaponry down
162 to chairs, knives, etc. (ie a barroom brawl, not a gang war)
163 ...........................................................................
164 But gang wars are fun? In reality, DESTROYER simply entered a domain withou
165 t checking behind all the doors for hidden traps and ambushes. Can you blam
166 e people for wanting to protect this last bastion of creative fiction? When
167 a new person enters the Inn, they will always be suspect. It is not the fau
168 lt of anyone, it is just the way things are. DESTROYER: Don't fly off the
169 handle and start attacking those around you. To slash out at unsigned criti
170 cs lowers yourself to their level. You are above such activities, aren't yo
171 u? Another point: Everyone has an ego, and when some omnipotent warrior nam
172 ed DESTROYER walks in like Clint Eastwood, High Plains Drifter, one can exp
173 ect a certain degree of resentment. I imagine that some of the unsigned att
174 acks on you were as much against your DESTROYER as they were against your 
175 use or misuse of the Inn. The best advice you can take is to cool down, cat
176 ch your breath, continue your story, and try to find Trainor. You have all
177 the elements of an interesting story. It may not be original, but there is
178 not much new under the sun in the world of fantasy writing. Keep up the
179 good work, and don't let the critics get you down. Critics never stopped
180 Chuck Norris and they should not stop you either. Carry on!

204                         they are well taken.  I will indeed call apon

207 Experience breeds contempt. A new person to any group is rarely greeted
208 with open arms. But everyone has been new at one time or another
209 except the inventor. Assuming none of you has invented the INN, perhaps
210 second thoughts should be taken. And a word of thanks to those cooler
211 and smarter heads who welcome newness with open arms and understand
212 the travails that can occur.
213 
214 IN THAT REGARD, I have been following some of the adventures of the Inn
215 as well as the controversy in relative silence now. As someone who enjoys
216 writing, but knows not some of the hidden doors, quasi-rules and senstive
217 areas of the inn, I would be most appreciative of having one of the old-
218 timer experts fill me (us?) in on some of the GUIDELINES. 
219 
220 Unless of course there are too many of you already, and some of the
221 bitterness comes from overcrowding, which is certainly understandable.
222 But if not, I for one would certainly enjoy hearing what DESTROYER
223 obviously was not privy to.
224 
225 Help anyone?

252 The current crop of writers on Backwater is great. It's these
253 periods creativity that makes if worth reading through the junk.
254 One suggestion though. You might try experimenting with a 
255 broader variety of styles. Remember the diversity of writing
256 styles that emerged from the battles of LeRoy McKane and the
257 world?
258 
259 The Grand Dragon Master really knew how to write. He created
260 a writing style that can still be seen reflected in the work of
261 some of the older writers. 
262 
263 I'd suggest you follow the Grand Dragon Masters example and
264 experiment. Don't get trapped in the narrative format. There
265 are other styles and formats that can express your intentions
266 more effectively. 
267 
268 Experiment. Stretch your creativity. Isn't that what it's all
269 about anyway?

329 Milchar:  You're using PAS to run programs?  Are you on the HoneyWell for
330    an EE class, or did you get it from a generous friend?  Anyway, I don't
331    have a copy of that immedietly available, but I believe that once it
332    gets the program and data names from you, it edits a standard JCL, inserting
333    the names, and submits it, returning you the infamous SNUMB.  There are
334    good and bad points to using PAS.  If you have a program that you're
335    still debugging, it's nice to see whether it died in the compile
336    stage or the run stage.  PAS doesn't let you see this, unless you
337    specifically ask for it (ie "JOUT snumb").  PAS also takes a certain
338    amount of time to edit the file each time, whereas if you set up a 
339    specific JCL for that job, it is sent directly to the interpreter.
340         Have you learned to use TEX or EDIT yet?  If not, there is a fair
341    tutor file hidden away.  Try "LIST RMTH-LIB/SZAFRON/TUTOR/PART".  This
342    should get you started, at least.  Another idea is to explore the manuals
343

354     It has been a long time since I have entered anything here. I won't 
355 even try creativity. Might as well jump into the discussion... pretending
356 I know it all.
357     Destroyer: Just because you are writing your stories here at the Inn
358 doesn't mean they have to take place here. I have been around a little under
359 a year and I don't know anything about this "way to write on Backwater".
360 If you were to create your own setting you would not have to worry about
361 terrible blunders. Sure, you might not want to put in extensive sex, violence,
362 and all that boring stuff.  Giving suggestions on-line is sort of difficult.
363 If you are serious about wanting to improve your writing ability you might
364 have someone you trust look over it and give you suggestions. (This is
365 provided they knew something about writing, or were a critical reader).
366 The motive for doing this would not be so you could put only "perfect"
367 stories here on the board, but to learn about what some of your flaws may
368 be. Once identified, they are easy to correct if you work on it.
369 Anyway, I liked you entries. They have their problems, true, but doesn't
370 everybody's? (Even Piper)

378   once in the great darkness at the inn there came a man of dubious intent.
379 he only had one thing in mind, and that was to find another by the name of
380 Salazar.  when this man had come to the inn and had seemimngly cornered this
381 man Salazar, he and his band of followers were stricke with fear when it
382 became obvious that no violence would be allowed within the great walls
383 founded by our dear innkeep and well defined upon construction by the wise
384 Dragon Lady.
385   the name of the man that had learned his lesson of non-violence the dif-
386 ficult way was Mohammed Wassir.  he learned these ways graciously, as did

388   it has never been known if these two men have ever run into each other
389 again, or what would happen if they may.  we may only guess.

391   now, as to the current situation...  i'm still stuck.  well informed,
392 but still stuck.  why is it that the present seems to crawl by so slowly
393 at times?  i can only hope to reach the silver lining i guess...

404   scarlet lion -- I know what you mean.  I feel that I may have bitten off
405 more than my mental capacity can deal with when I tried to tackle this
406 particular story line.  (You darn betcha my writing gots flaws!  The biggest
407 one seems to be the (presumed) intellectual capacity of the author.)
408 Oh, well -- was it Thomas Jefferson or Emerson who said something to the
409 effect that "Consistency is the bugaboo of a small mind"?  I refuse to 
410 be small-minded about it, so here goes.
411 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
412   The lady Tayree moved back from the innocent question asked by the wounded
413 woman.  "How long has it been since you died?" the question seemed to ring
414 in her brain.  Her questioners frank, open look denied any malice in the 
415 question; rather it was said with the innocence of a child in a play-yard.
416   Unseen with physical eyes, whorls of energy had accompanied the lady Tayree
417 into the chamber.  Stirred by her agitation, one sensitive to these forces
418 would have hesitated before stepping into an area pregnant with so many
419 potentials -- slid quietly away without disturbing the deceptive calm.
420 Perhaps the greatest risk of developing mental powers is to the sanity of
421 the person developing them.  Often, the budding mental adept tries to
422 reject the power and new life that is developing and tries desparately
423 to cling to the commonplace that had been before.  Like trying to dam
424 a raging mountain stream with a bank of earth, it has been done; altho
425 h the situation is inherently unstable.  Should a trickle of water make
426 its way through the tighly packed earth of a high mountain dam, disaster
427 soon follows.
428 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
429   tsl -- we're a long way from on a roll, but maybe we can get going.  I need
430 your reactions, feelings, the inner stuff of your character in this situation.
431 Just try to react naturally, I'll try to keep at least semi-consistent
432 (and clean).  I would guess that if Tayree tried a mental probe at this 
433 point the extra energy would move these two into a different mental universe
434 that could add to both characters.

438 Long Time Lurker:
439 
440     I agree that the Grand Dragon Master was one of the great Backwater 
441 writers. On a board that seems to consider good spelling as a mark of 
442 great writing he did so much more.
443     I guess what made him great was that he was a master of plot development.
444 In a few short paragraphs he could introduce plot twists that would revive
445  dying adventures.
446     This, of course, was an inspiration to the really creative writers. 
447 Those who did their plot development by committee found it frustrating.
448     Character development was another strength of the Grand Dragon 
449 Master. He fully developed the LeRoy McKane character without even directly 
450 using him. He did it almost entirely by indirect reference. Now that takes 
451 talent.
452     I think you're right to suggest writers emulate the contributions 
453 of the Grand Dragon Master. He was truly one of the Backwater greats. It's 
454 too bad that he's gone. Whatever happened to him anyway?

494      What? Who is this man? Why does he help my from under the table? What is

497 I must hide. I cannot move! I am bound! No escape! But wait. Where are the 
498 arrows? Where is the fire? The room. Yes, the room is here, and the bed. Why

503 Oh, my head.  I tried to sit up in my darkened surroundings.  Slowly I
504 managed it.  Somehow I'd been waylaid, which didn't particularly surprise me.
505 You see, I'm a DS.  I take care of the major extradimensional routes from
506 Terra to Sirius.  That also includes making sure none of the routes are being
507 used for such things as smuggling.  My last assignment dealt with a few
508 smugglers.  They probably put me here.
509 Wherever here was.
510 I got up and brushed myself off.  I noted the dirt floor.  Exceedingly
511 primitive.  I hoped that my Passkey was still around.  It would bee tough
512 getting home without it.
513 I groped around, found a door.  I swung it open, and moonlight streamed into
514 the hut.  Yes, it was a crude hut of some sort, made from earth and woven
515 vegetation.  I scanned the dirt for my Key.
516 A glint caught my eye.  Yes, they'd left it with me.  I picked it up and
517 examined it.  Damn, they'd crushed part of it.  Until I could repair it I was
518 stuck here.
519 Again, wherever here was.
520 I left the hut, proposing to find out.

582 Then my friend Zephyr has been here!  The busy paths of cat and rabbit
583 seem to cross only distantly--hey, Zephyr:  let's do lunch sometime.
584 Next time I'm INNbound I'll have my girl call your service...truffles
585 a la mode for you, and a catnip salad, thank you very much, for me.
586 I'll be a-waiting on the hearth by the fire--a fine place for a small
587 black cat.
588 ..........................................Entropy.........................
589 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
590 To RHD inc:  Can anybody start a story at the inn?  Sure.  Will others
591 accept the story, or even *like* it, or **PRAISE** it.  No gaurantees.
592 Generally when you start at the inn, you are asking others to join you.
593 Who is there?  Nobody knows.  The inn seems full of shadows, vague presences
594 lurk just outside the revealing light, and only occasionally do we glimpse
595 a face or hear a voice.  The conventions are actually few -- this is a
596 public area and you should use public manners.  It's very impolite to 
597 manipulate another person's character, or put words in their mouths.  
598 (That earned a certain poor rabbit a few rather harsh words.)  This reality
599 was developed by consensus, and changes also by consensus.
600   The inn has at least two floors (the piper sleeps there when he's around)
601 and a stable with the innkeeper's steed in the rear.  In an empty stall in
602 the stable lie a few very large white feathers on the mouldering straw.
603 (Mikey -- who cleans the stables around here anyway?)  Near the front door
604 stands a Rowan tree, planted by Pam, who used to be barmaid.  A stream runs
605 nearby, crossed by a footbridge, and a path runs downstream to a nearby 
606 seaport.  That's about it... oops, I forgot to mention the rest rooms at
607 the Inn.  In a historical incident, the original crude facilities were
608 replaced by a complete Roman bath -- sunken tub the size of a swimming pool,
609 steam room, couches on which to recline, as well as the sanitary facilities.
610   If you want to start a story in which you control the entire thing, just
611 make the setting elswhere and have at it.  You probably won't get much
612 comment if it's ok, but be prepared to weather some acid comments from
613 the sharper-tounged among us.  Blessed be.
614 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
615 :-> Well, all I can say is...  "At The Bottom!"     Max... <-:
616 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
617 And hardly can you say that, Max.
618 For I am at the bottom.
619 Why is the bottom worse than the top? True, English is read left
620 to right, top to bottom.  The last line read conventionally remains
621 fresher than the first though.  I would rather not be restrained by
622 social customs.  I am free to judge the bottom better than the top.
623   Mais oui'
624 And yet truer, the bottom is met with more anguish.  This is only true
625 though, because it is the end.
626 And with all things an end must come, even to that of a good disk.
627 Do you recall the first line more vividly than this, the very last,
628 you are reading?
629 I think not.

TOTAL NUMBER OF LINES = 629
