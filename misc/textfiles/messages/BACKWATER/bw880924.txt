265 atheist and/or agnostic. And look at the constitution, it doesn't specifical-

268 in the heart of people, there would be national discipline. I dont care what

345                OLIVER NORTH'S SECRET PLAN TO DECLARE MARTIAL LAW
346  
347           While caught up in exposing Fawn Hall's hairstyle, Ollie North's
348      heroic gap-toothed smile, and the soap opera ambience of the
349      Congressional Contragate hearings, most of America's media ignored the
350      chilling constitutional issue of Oliver North's secret plan to declare
351      martial law.
352           But Alfonso Chardy, of THE MIAMI HERALD, was not deluded by
353      North's charisma nor frightened by North's earlier warning to him not
354      to investigate the National Security Council's (NSC) connection to the
355      Nicaraguan resistance.
356           Unfortunately, Chardy's extraordinary disclosures about North
357      went unexplored and unreported by other major media.
358           On July 5, 1987, Chardy reported over the KNT News Wire that
359      Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North helped draft a plan in 1984 to impose
360      martial law in the United States in event of an emergency.
361           According to Chardy, the secret plan called for suspension of the
362      Constitution, turning control of the government over to the
363      little-known Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), appointment
364      of military commanders to run state and local governments, and the
365      declaration of martial law in the event of such a crisis as nuclear
366      war, violent and widespread internal dissent or national opposition to
367      a U.S. military invasion abroad.
368           North helped draft the plan to impose martial law while serving
369      as the NSC's laiason to FEMA. Chardy reported that an administration
370      official said the contingency plan was written as part of an executive
371      order or legislative package that Reagan would sign and hold within
372      NSC until such time as a severe crisis arose. "It is not known whether
373      Reagan signed the plan," Chardy added.
374           The plan was extraordinary enough to even frighten then-Attorney
375      General William French Smith into protesting to Robert McFarlane,
376      North's NSC boss at the time, that FEMA was establishing itself as an
377      "emergency czar" and "exceeding its proper function as a coordinating
378      agency for emergency preparedness."
379           This secret plan to declare martial law in the event of internal
380      dissent or national opposition to a U.S. military invasion abroad took
381      on an added dimension as citizens gathered to protest the nation's
382      intervention in Honduras in March, 1988.

396 I don't much care what religion any politician is: Christian, Moslem, Agnostic,
397 or Pagan.  It scares me when Reagan says to the Moral Majority that if they
398 get a religious bill through Congress, he'll sign it.  With the majority of
399 Supreme Court justices being conservatives, and having several who oppose the
400 idea of separation of church and state, I see a potential of something as bad
401 politically in this country as The Bomb is physically.

422 Yeah, OK.  So George Bush isn't the ideal candidate.  But when I think
423 about Dukakis, I get a mental image of the Carter years.  And if THAT
424 isn't enough to make one a devout Republican, I don't know what is.
425  
426 As for religions, I don't think anything will ever happen that will 
427 violate the separation of church and state clause.  There are too many
428 people who would scream bloody murder.  And when it comes to morals,
429 it doesn't take religion to create them.  I happen to be one of the
430 most convinced atheists that I've ever met.  And I have pretty high
431 moral standards without having a "god" to scare them into me.

436 I agree, sort of.  I personaly need no god to force, scare, or threaten me
437 into maintaning a set of desent moral standards.  If you do...feel free to
438 believe in what you need, or want as the case may be.  But keep in mind that
439 I too, even without this belief, am a member of the United State of America.
440 Yet I am not saying our currency should say "There is no God to trust in!".
441 I only want the government to stay as neutral in the matter as possible.
442 Not holding one view point...or the other.  This is somehow the way I

458 recommended for those living near a freeway or owner of a brand new Porche))

487    Disappointment.
488  
489    Liberal!  Conservative!  Democratic!  Republican!  Independent!
490 Libertarian!  Communist!  Democracy!  Socialist!
491  
492    What a bunch of... confused but nice people.
493  
494    There is NO answer to the political question.  Politics is a matter of
495 power, not of state.  Harumf!  Even the 'state' steals, and yet it
496 detains those who do the very same thing!  What a set of double-standards!
497 (And I thought I was bad...)
498  
499    I'm gonna say this ONE LAST TIME:
500  
501    There is NO form of 'polictical state' that can meet the demands of
502 any people.  The best form of control is SELF-CONTROL; as you mind your
503 own business, so does everyone else.  You don't need a "XR7000 Big Brother
504 Spy-Eye" over your shoulder to see what you're reading.  Basically,
505 politics and government are complex but serious POWER TRIPS.  Government
506 wasn't created to protect the people from themselves (as the state would
507 like to have you to believe) - it was ORIGINALLY created for some
508 TWIT (not unlike the one's we've had in the past) who just HAD TO HAVE
509 his/her STINK'N FINGERS ON EVERYTHING!  Someone said, 'gee, if I
510 terrorize the people, and then make them attack/defend/vex themselves
511 rather than me, I would be able to have control over them!'
512  
513    ANARCHY is not a solution
514    ANARCHISM could be a solution - there is a BIG difference in what the
515 words mean, reguardless of context!  Don't confuse them!
516  
517    The best religion is PERSONAL AND PRIVATE religion.  To say anything
518 else would be to discredit that religion!  I'll try and make this as
519 simple as possible; So, let's say you'll be saved/lifted up/absorbed
520 by the great nothing/reincarnated/recycled/stuck in h*ll/etc. etc. etc.
521 SO WHAT?!?  If you KNOW you're going to be 'saved', then why worry about
522 everyone else's religions?  After all, in THEIR eyes, they will be
523 'saved', and not YOU.  If you can't except that, then you are not
524 a member of a religion - you are a member of a CULT!  And that is what
525 a cult is - a following in a belief that revolves around building that
526 following!  I know some 'Christians' will jump on my case about
527 spreading their beliefs, but then again, my 'religion' says I
528 don't have to worry about that now, does it?  Same goes for EVERYONE-
529 especially ME!
530  
531    - and what that means is I am voiceing my OPINION, and you are in
532 no way obligated to agree, accept, or even attempt to understand what
533 I have said.  Opinions are great, and they are personally important to
534 me.  But the absolute 'word' from someone or something just doesn't cut
535 it.  Life isn't static; it has been and always will be DYNAMIC!
536  
537    So voice your opinions, but don't stick it down my throat!

718    To those who choose ANARCHISM - anarchism is to live without government
719 by any means or form.  The only reason I brought up anarchism is that
720 it seems to be the only word that describes what I see;  still, it does not
721 come close at all.  I like the gas alegory - very good!  If people would
722 merely respect other people's religions, rather than try to convert them,
723 I think that Iran and Iraq would stop fighting for the first time in
724 EONS.  I myself am a self-procliamed agnostic - if you can prove to me
725 that a peticular religion is true, then I would consider joining. (maybe
726 I should say self-styled, instead...)
727  
728    But, even though I am agnostic, it does not mean that I can't
729 participate in a religious setting (unless that religion
730 refuses activities by 'outsiders').  If you are Christian, then I will
731 try to keep a Christian frame of mind to relate to those around me.  If
732 you are Shinto, then I will observe Shinto practices at a prayer temple.
733 You might say that ALL religions are true in my eyes - except the ones
734 that seem cult-like.
735  
736    Here's a brain teaser...does the 'state' REALLY EXIST?  See if
737 you can understand this one...
738  
739    I'm not voting.  Why should I?  I can persue my own form of
740 government without interfereing with those around me...

755 Anarchism would seem the way to go on the surface.  The problem is, you
756 are counting on everyone to act "morally".  What is morally?  During
757 the Dark Ages, the Catholic Church decided what was moral.  Now, nobody
758 knows what is moral.  What society then does is make laws concerning
759 what is moral, then metes out punishment to those who don't conform.
760 But as people begin to conform more and more together, the ones who are
761 different stick out more and more, so laws are needed to bring those
762 into line... talk about a vicious circle.

812 Did somebody say Fred?  Here I am.  
813  
814 First, a joke.  How do Smurfs reproduce?  With bags over their heads.
815 Ok, sorby, it wasn't that funny.
816  
817 There are too many dishonest/immoral/whatever-you-want-to-call-it 
818 people in this world for anarchism to ever work.  Once you accept that,
819 government becomes a whole lot less annoying.
820  
821 Since I don't have anything better to do, I'll expound on Fred's personal
822 views of life, the universe, and pantyhose:
823  
824 I don't want, you, my mother, or anyone else making my moral decisions
825 for me, as long as what I choose to do doesn't hurt anyo~e e|ce.  That 
826 means that I think my pornography pile should be legal.  It means
827 abortion should be legal.  It doesn't mean drugs should be illegal, since
828 there's a major chance of a drug user harming someone else.  (I feel the
829 same way aboet alcohol, but that's already proven not to work.)
830  
831 I think womens liberation sucks little pickles, even though I believe in
832 equal rights for everone.  I do NOT believe in affirmative action and all
833 the other force-em-to-be-given-prefurential-treatment-type-bullshit.  It's
834 no better than discrimination.  Ideally, any decisions should be 100% 
835 race/gender/sexual-preference blind.  But I realize that will never happen,
836 so I only get pissed about it occasionally.
837  
838 I'm not a conservative, and I'm not a liberal.  My leanings are towards
839 conservatism and republicanism, however.  (I don't believe in all of the
840 democratic do-gooder social programs, or protectionist trade policies,
841 or santa claus.  Smetymes I don't even believe in my shift key.)  I 
842 believe heavily in the separation of church and state.  It pisses me off
843 to say, "one nation under god."  
844  
845 Speaking of god, I'm an atheist.  And I think that atheists are one of the
(46 most picked on minority groups in the country.  We get bombarded by 
847 religion at every turn.  I'm willing to listen (with an open mind) to you
848 tell me why you believe your religion is true.  I expect you to do the
849 same.  I want to see co}pabqtive religion classes taught in public
850 (high) schools.  But only in terms of "This is what some people believe.
851 It's not necessarily true."  I don't believe in censorship of any type.
852  
853 I think Jesse Jackson should be strung up by xis 7nads.  Of course, I
854 really don't, since it's only because of my personal differences with
855 his opinions.  But it's definitely an amusing idea nonetheless.
856  
857 I don't believe that anybody really gives a shit about anything I've
858 zest0caid.  Of course, I'm probably wrong.  I also don't believe that
859 I have the right to fill up the whole disk (although I don't worry
860 about it because the software won't let me.  Good job, Mikey.)
861

878 care of itself.
879  
880 Oh well, I guess somebody else can come up with somthing.
881  
882 Ah yes, I almost forgot. Abortion is a definate gray area in yer definition 
883 o what is right or wrong. You are assuming that the unborn child is not a
884 pearson and therefore has no rights. I tend to believe that the unborn
885 child is a person and therefor has rights.
886  
887 I have no religios reason vor this. It just seems wrong to me to kill unborn
888 children.
889  
890 Now I did say it was a gray area. It also could be argued that a woman has a 
891 right to do with her body as she choses. Of course I think that trying
892 to avoid consequencus ov actions is bad in any case. (Meaning that pregnancy
893 doesn't just happen.)
894  
895 It really boils down to wether you believe the fetus to be a person. I do.
896 I have no choice but to take the stand I have taken. I am open to argument.

905    To be technical, abortion is not for me to decide upon - it should
906 be left to those whom it affects.  I don't have a problem with people
907 for or against abortions; I prefer to be neutral about it.  What I
908 would like to see is less pressure on the Teen-Age community from Ade|ts
909 in obtaining birth control (that is, if it fits their belief system -
910 not everyone believes in birth control.  Personally, I do...)  If
911 contraceptives were made availible at this level, it would have the
912 opposite affect of that whicx evuryone is afraid of.  Taking birth
913 control away from the nation's youth WILL NOT STOP THEM FROM DOING
914 THINGS when the parents leave the house...they'll go ahead and do
915 it anyway.  If this is the case, and I know it to be so, then why
91& d Adults take great measures in removing birth control?  Are they
917 afraid that their 'poor little darlings' will learn abit more than
918 the birds and the bees?  If that's so, then we're still in the
919 sexual dark ages - and I've got news for them about the 4th grader
920 who comprehends what it is before they reach the Sex-Ed classes in
921 Jr High...makes me wonder how the Earth has manageto keep itself
922 together without falling on its face.

930 that I can't exactly place.  It seems as if it creates problems
9#1 in0this place.  Too bad, isn't it?"
932  
933    The barkeep returned, with some beers on a serveing (sp) (ack!)
934 platter.  To his annoyance, I levitated a beer to Wonderer, being
935 careful not to let the suds run over until it landed on the tarle.>.
936  
937    "Where are the others?" (grumble, grumble) "Will they return,
938 or will they be summoned?  I personally dislike summoning...say,
939 I know!   Maybe if I sent some beer to Kurfur, he would come of
940 his own free will.  Give me q moment to make a small portal" as
941 I strained to open a passage to Kurfur's home, and the sweat
942 started to pour.  Never had it been so hard to pry apart Beta Space...
943 as if something was still out there, trying to hold eternity in its
944 grip.0 I saw Kurfur, along with some others, and promptly put the
945 Stein in his hand when he raised it.  Although he was a little startled,
946 I'm sure he caught the message I had sent.  There was a merry gleam
947 in his eye as he read:
948  
949 0  [0COMPLEMENTS OF THE FRIENDLY GURU.  WANT MORE?  TRY THE INN...]
950  
951    Then I closed Beta Space, then the Eye, and returned to the
952 Inn's friendly surroundings.  The Barkeep didn't look to happy - 
953 he remembered the last time Kurfur sxowet.  Nearly went 'damn broke
954 trying to keep him satisfied...at least that's the vibes I got from
955 the poor, red-faced, unhappy barkeep.
956  
957    "Say, maybe we could make the Inn a purely material place- ya know,
958 bind it to Beta Spacu for easy travel & security.  It would be a
959 welcome place for the tired, hurt, hungry, and the lonely searching
960 for friendship.  Could it be done?"  I knew it would take great
961 effort to transport the place, maybe all of my strength, but it guld
962 be worth it to have a 'safe house' for those to come to when life
963 wouldn't allow them a 'time-out'.  (Sit and wait,) I thought.

9'5   Camp Director: The reason you seem to see religion and politics 
976                  mentioned in the same breath is there is a concerted
977                  effort being put forth right now upon politicians
978                  to relax somu of dhe rigidness of separation of the
979                  two.  (Wow!  Did that make sense?)  There is being put
980                  into place a network of churches with committees who
981                  will be sending telegrams to politicians co~ceb~ing
982                  bills in Congress.  If a few hundred letters and tele-
983                  grams can make a Congressperson to change his/her vote,
984                  imagine 2,000-3,000 people all registering the same

991               ory as religion is an act of faith.  See, believing that the
992               universe fell together, and life just happened is like my
993               that if you put all the pieces of a Timex watch in a dryer
994               and let it tumble for a hundred million years, someday it 
995               would all fall together and keep perfect time.  It is much
996               easier to believe in Someone who created this place purposely
997 0             than for me to believe all this was accidental.  Both are
