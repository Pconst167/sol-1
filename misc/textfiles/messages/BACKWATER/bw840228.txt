21 The buzzing sound around the small table in the inn was so faint it could be
22 a fly buzzing in the bottom of a bottle.  Those gathered around the table
23 including a young man with an oddly shaped hammer in his belt barely noticed
24 as the sound grew in volume.  Soon it was pervasive, the drone of distant
25 pipes, approaching quicker, the drone increasing in volume as the approach
26 quickened.  Suddenly the air shimmered and the piper appeared, playing
27 the rather trite march "Scotland the Brave."
28 His appearance had changed slightly.  He carried a different leather sporran
29 belted around his waist,  and, in addition, carried a dirk sheathed at 
30 his waist.  He came to the end of the song, stopped the pipes, and sat at
31 the table.
32   "Please excuse me for rushing off that way, but I thought that I had 
33 better see if I could catch some essential supplies.  I'm afraid that this
34 is the most weapon that I can carry."
35   He unsheathed the dirk anddisplayed it's 18 inch length to the company.
36 He then resheathed the weapon and continued.
37   "I was also able to get some supplies from an old friend .... "
38   He lifted the leather sporran onto the table and opened it.  Reaching deep
39 into the sporran, the piper pulled out a long, squared, glass bottle that
40 obviously could not have fit within.  Reaching in again, he fumbled for
41 some time, then to a clink of glassware, pulled out six or seven glass 
42 tumblers.  He passed them to the brave party and poise the bottle over 
43 the first.
44   "I was able to get a drop of the Glenlivit to send us off on our quest.
45 For a journey like this it seemed useful to begin with a single malt."
46   The piper poured each a tumbler of the oily brown fluid, then raise his
47 glass to the company.
48   "Chaos and confusion to the Hairy Fish-Nuts!"

51 Foti,why term. reagan? he is just the figurehead for the people who control 
52 him.the people who backed his multi-mega-buck campaign for instance,I too,am
53 for disarmmament,but in a rather different way...
54 If we(the u.s.a.) desrtoyed ALL of our nuclear weapons tommorow,what would
55 happen?
56 1.Russia would instantly invade us and make us all communnests,right? WRONG!
57 how would russia control us? if they used nuclear weapons on us the land 
58 that they are after will be radio-active for too long to be of any use.there
59 are not enough people in russia for this to happen.it seems to me that if
60 Japan can get along and even thrive w/o nukes,we can too.I realise that this
61 scene will NEVEr take place,because our government is controled by large
62 multi-national companys that make lotsa bucks on nuke weapons,TRW for 
63 example.

72 Johnathan Chance: I was quoting from the article, & in any case ALL
73 mesons ARE leptons!
74 In fact according to SOME theories, a muon is merely an excited state of an

77 Derek Kinne: I suggest you read your msgs after leaving them. This system
78 does NOT accept uploads very well, you lost the first (2-10?) letters of

81 DOM: First, in regard to your language, "Shikata-ga-nai".
82 Now as to your other points, 
83 1. the fact that something can't be proven is not sufficient cause to
84 believe that it DOESN'T exist either.
85 2. I agree, one god is about as likely as another (ie not very).
86 3. I must disagree, nothingness (depending on your definition) is NOT 
87 necessarily the simplest possible state. (see article mentioned on previous disk

91  The bard, finally noticing what he was doing, apoligized; "I started doing
92 this a LONG time ago. It's a habit I cultivated to keep off the 'Hairy Fishnuts'
93 The cord is a Thuggee garrotte, and I'm sure you know how well THEY get along 
94 with the 'fishnuts'."
95  Turning to the piper, "I'd never seen one shaped like a sporran before....", he
96 commented crypticaly. He accepted a tumbler and started drinking. Upon finishing
97 he said, "I hope you will forgive me, my friend, but if I drink any more of that
98 fine drink 'twill have to be mixed with a bit of soda."
99  He reached into his pouch and removed a cylindrical metal object, painted in
100 strange patterns and runes (green and silver). Pressing on the top he poured 
101 his glass full of a clear, sparkling liquid -- which should have been impossible
102 as the can was but 3/4 the size of the tumbler. 
103  "Would anyone else like some of this beverage? It is non-alcholic (pity).
104 I believe it is called 'Pixie'... or was that 'Sprite', something like that 
105 anyway."
106  "As for weapons, well, if I must I have a spear and a greatsword. (I never DID
107 get the hang of shieldwork)."

109 piper (and my fellow "adventurers"): I would like to meet you, in the
110 flesh, as it were. Would any of you care to meet me at the PORSFIS meeting
111 in the library tommorrow? (2 pm SW 10th & Taylor)

114       A tall dark-cloaked figure threaded his way through the crowd at the
115 Inn and took his familiar table in the rear.  He noticed that one voice was
116 absent from the babble.  Silently, he wished his friend Contremon well in
117 his journey.
118      After receiving his ale from the barmaid, he took out quill and 
119 foolscap and began to write:
120 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
121      It was one of those rainy Thursdays.  God, how I hate the rain.  My
122 name is Salazar -- from Chief Inspector of the Turkish National Police to a
123 private detective in Portland.  I could have gone to San Francisco or Los
124 Angeles or even the Big Apple; but nooooooooo ..., I end up in Portland.
125 You know Portland: Rust capital of the nation.
126      My grumbling about the rain was interrupted by the ringing of my tele-
127 phone.  "Hello... Huh... Who?   Fairy Lugnuts?  What?  Oh, yes... Hairy
128 Fishnuts, I'm sorry you have the wrong reality...  S'alright." Click.
129      Before I could resume my grumbling, my secretary Serena glided into my
130 office.  My pulse quickened.  She handed me the payment check from the
131 Robner case to endorse.  While I signed my name, she prattled gaily about
132 how wonderful Portland was; "Isn't Portland wonderful?  Isn't the rain
133 refreshing?"
134      I couldn't take it any more; "Yeah, with Frank Ivancie and his loony-
135 bin rejects running things.  City council meetings are better than Three
136 Stooges' reruns."
137      Instead of getting my usual lecture (or a stiff right cross), Serena
138 simply sighed; "We've got a client out front.  I'll show her in."
139      My new client was some classy dame... tailored business suit, legs
140 that didn't quit, honey blond hair... Ahem.  When I stopped drooling, I
141 asked her to tell me her problem.  The story poured out.  Name: Lisa Hutton 
142 - very rich.  Father - Cornelius  -  Mr. Megabucks.  Stepmother: Kathryn -
143 young, beautiful, ambitious, dangerous.  Daddy was kidnapped three days
144 ago while jogging in Washington Park.  Ransom demand - the family heirloom,
145 The Phonix's Egg (2 oz. of pure diamond) to be placed in the 9th hole cup
146 of Glendoveer golf course, March 8th, 3 AM.  The hitch - the rock had 
147 disappeared from the family vault.  My assignment: find the rock, find
148 daddy, or both.  She paid a month's retainer up front in cash.  I was very
149 sympathetic.
150      After Lisa left, Serena came rushing in; "Salazar, I think the postman
151 brought us a big problem."  Big problem may have been an understatement.
152 When I rushed into the reception area, on Serena's desk sat a wrapped 
153 package -- making noises.
154      Tick... Tick... Tick...
155      Just like grandma's old alarm clock, or maybe a bomb...
156           T I C K ... T I C K ... T I C K ...
157 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
158       The man in the rear put away his writing for a while and sat back to
159 listen to the tale that seemed to be developing from the brave band of
160 adventurers at the next table.  As he signaled the barmaid for another ale,
161 he wondered if Pam would make an appearance later?

193 To the unsigned grump above:
194      Say, you wouldn't be related to one of the Bruise brothers, Billy Bob
195 or Orville Ray?  The attitude sounds familiar.  But drivel is a hard cross
196 to bear.  A couple of suggestions:
197      A.  If you don't like the contributions of others, make some meaningful
198          ones of your own.
199      B.  If you don't want to do that try closing your eyes when the parts
200          that offend you scroll by.
201      C.  If all else fails, stuff it.

227 you are right. Sorry. Sincere apology.
228 MIG: (I think?)
229     The U.S. relies too much on nuclear weapons to disarm. We don't have
230 enough convetional waepons. Tale a look at this months Scientific
231 American.

236 Man In Gray:  I did not say that the US
237 should just  disarm all nukes.  
238  I just think that anyone who actually
239 believes that by making more weapons
240 they are preserving peace must have a
241 very large screw stuck up their a**es and it has finally been
242 turned enough to touch the brain.

246 If anything you are increasing the chances for world
247 destruction, if that is still possible.
248 It is amazing that billions of people would let
249 a few hundred @*#% rule theier
250 world to the brink of
251 total destruction.
252 
253   I say the people of the world should gather unity
254 and over throw the rulers and hang them  from the
255 nearest tree!
256 
257 Then tie them to all of their precious peace keeping
258 devices and shoot them into outer space.
259 
260 Then, when someone else wants to be new ruler
261 we shoot him into space also!

280 As for a technique for reading all of the lines that have been entered
281 since you last logged on, I'm afraid I don't know of any, using the up

346                        THE COLOUR OF MAGIC
347                        by Terry Pratchett
348      Perched on the backs of four cosmically gargantuan elephants 
349 (who  are in turn traversing the intergalactic void atop a  giant 
350 sea turtle),  is the Discworld, a frisbee of a planet that exists 
351 only  because,  well,  every probability curve MUST have its  far 
352 end.  Its atmosphere crackling with magic,  this most  improbable 
353 locale  is  the setting for Terry Pratchett's latest  yarn,  'The 
354 Colour  of Magic' - the most hilariously madcap travelogue  since 
355 Douglas Adams' 'Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy' trilogy. 
356      Of course,  travel and adventure are the furthest thing from 
357 Rincewind's mind.  A dropout from wizard's college,  cowardly  by 
358 disposition, he sits quietly slurping his beer in the murky light 
359 of  the Broken Drum tavern.  Here in the squalid,  crime-infested 
360 city of Morpork, one lives by the sword or in the shadows, and it 
361 is  from those shadows that the failed wizard spies a  pint-sized 
362 foreigner  enter the inn,  trailed by - can it be?  - a chest  of 
363 rare sapient pearwood... moving on dozens of tiny legs.
364      The visitor is Twoflower, an insurance actuary who'd shucked 
365 his painfully boring life on the much-too-civilized Counterweight 
366 Continent   for  a  glimpse  of  the  pie-plate   planet's   more 
367 adventurous side. But now, his inept phrasebook conversation with 
368 the  innkeeper  is  about to cost him a large hunk of  his  ample 
369 travel budget.
370      Rincewind,  fluent in most tongues (and with a covetous  eye 
371 on the pearwood),  intercedes on the tourist's behalf - and earns 
372 himself a job as tourguide.
373      But  keeping  tabs on the blissfully naive Twoflower  is  no 
374 easy task,  especially once the spreading news of his chestful of 
375 gold  brings out Morpork's worst.  It's downright  dangerous,  in 
376 fact.  And just as Rincewind is about to abandon Twoflower to the 
377 thieves  and  scoundrels,  the  stern Patrician  of  Ankh-Morpork 
378 summons Rincewind to deputize him as the little fellow's official 
379 protector.
380      Twoflower's knack for emerging unscathed becomes apparent as 
381 they  flee the smoldering rubble of what was  - before  Twoflower 
382 took  to playing with fire - the ancient city or Morpork.  And so 
383 does his knack for finding trouble.  For on their  chaotic,  zany 
384 adventure,  they'll encounter vicious trolls,  a treeful of irate 
385 dryads,  the  soul-eating  Bel-Shamharoth,  a sexy  but  sinister 
386 dragonlady,  Death and his unexpected deputy, slavers at sea, and 
387 more.
388      But  as Lady Luck and Fate roll dice for the duo's  destiny, 
389 the  wizard and the tourist (to say nothing of the Luggage)  will 
390 find  themselves  set adrift in a stubborn current yanking  them, 
391 inexorably, toward the planet's precipitous edge...
392 
393            Also watch for Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern.

396        (* SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE GOT THEIR SCIENCE FICTION BOOK CLUB "THINGS TO COME" TODAY! *)
397  The Poet looked with alarm at his new-found companions, and swallowed his      
398 Glenlivit in a quick gulp.
399  "I believe you are jumping to conclusions, my friends," he said. "There is as  
400 yet little evidence to link the bald ones to the events in question. I am happy 
401  that you are all so eager to risk yourselves in armed conflict for the Inn, but
402 I must counsel caution. Our enemies unknown. They could even be among us now,   
403 and we'd never know it. Lynn suggested going to see the wizard; I know not which
404 wizard she meant, but perhaps it would be best if we did consult him.
405 We may all go, but from what I know of wizards this is likely to alarm him. My  
406 Suggestion is this: we should split into two parties, one to check out the 
407 used BOLO lot, the other to go off to see the wizard. Lynn, of course, would
408 lead the latter, while our friend from the 20th century (in which reality, by
409 the way?) would lead the former. Are there any other ideas?"
410 While he waited for an answer, the Mad One signalled the Innkeeper for another
411 seven ales. His throat was dry again, and knowing this group it might be a 
412 long time before they could reach an agreement.
413                    && The Mad Actor &&
414 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
415 Seeing the signs of incipient disagreement, the piper reached again into his
416 sporran and pulled out three more bottles.  Setting two on the table, he 
417 uncapped the third, poured his glass full, then passed on the bottle.  He 
418 quickly drank off half the glass, then with his words taking on a slight slur,
419 "Mmm- agreeable to me.  I somehow assumed that the dudes in the yellow bedsheets
420 were behind a lot of this, but you're right.  I suppose I should go with the 
421 lady to follow the yellow brick road while someone else checks out the yellow
422 bedsheet brigade?"
423   The piper took another draught from his glass.  "One thing," he said 
424 sternley.  "No little yappy dogs.  I dislike little yappy dogs!  Big dogs are
425 alright as long as they don't slobber.  If we must get a dog for this expedition
426 let's get a St. Bernard.  I can send it to Deborah with the brandy I am buying
427 her.  Barkeep!  Barkeep! "  He turned from the table.  "Give Deborah a drink on
428 my tab."  Starting slightly, he reached into his sporran.  The watchers saw a
429 yellow glint as he handed something to the innkeeper.  "Pleas keep this against
430 my account.  I may be in need when I get back."
431 Slightly unsteadily, the piper turned back to his comrades and began to hum,
432 slightly off-tune, "We're off to see the Wizard ...."
433 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
434 Bard-
435   I would like to meet you and some of our other intreped adventurers in the
436 flesh, but logistics (a sick three-year old) preclude the possibility today.
437 perhaps in the future???
438 Deborah-
439 The brandy's on the way.  Since no one has offered many treatments, here's one
440 that may be heroic, but it works for me.
441 During early evening (6:00 to 9:00) prepare about a quart of hot lemonade 
442 using about 6 lemons and only enough sugar so you can drink it.  Heat this just
443 short of boiling and add 4 oz of your favorite spiritous liquor.  Immerse 
444 yourself in a steaming hot bathtub, as hot as you can stand, and drink the 
445 "lemonade" as quickly and hot as possible.  Don't stay in the bath too long.  
446 In about 5-10 minutes, go to bed and cover up thouroughly.  At about 2:00 AM
447 change the sheets (they'll be soaked).  Take it easy the next day, but the flu
448 should be nearly completely eliminated.
449 
450 CAUTION*** Know your own limitations!  If you attempt this cure, be sure 
451 someone is around at all times!  You can get your body temp too high and get
452 into deep trouble!  (I've almost passed out in that bathtub -- but not quite!)
453 Use with caution and discretion!
454 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
455 Walrus: You might try using the FA command to look for your "goo goo g'joob" 
456 At the > prompt type:
457 NU Y          (this turns on the line numbers)
458 FA goo goo g'joob          (this will display ALL the line on the current disk 
459                             that contain "goo goo g'joob")
460 When the listing is finished note the line number of the last line.
461 Then type:
462 NU N
463 LN line # (this will redisplay the line specified)
464 PRINT    (this will start listing with the following line & continue to the end 
465             of the disk)
466 
467 	You can use any string in the FA command, I normally use my "border" & my name:
468 FA _Leonard_  (this will let me find the end of my last msg)

474  I would be pleased to lead the second group to the Bolo Lot.
475 Just what the heck is a 'Bolo', was there a reference to their
476 being sentinent?!! Who is going to see the wizard and who is going
477 to the Bolo.
478 
479 As for the 20th century reality, I'm ot sure of where it is in relation
480 to the Inn, but it is one in which the U.S. is no longer in one piece
481 and Russia and China have been fighting it out for several decades now.
482 (subjective time). But, as I said, I am widley travelled.

486 Walrus: Leonards suggestions of how to avoid having to read 
487 everything all over again will work but I use a system that I 
488 think is easier. When I'm finished visiting the Inn I enter 
489 List to get the number of lines that have been used. I write 
490 this down on a piece of paper I keep by my computer. When I 
491 go on-line again I use the LN command to get me where I left 
492 off (LN line #) then the PRINT command to get the screen 
493 scrolling. To use the LN command you type LN, then the line 
494 number you want to go to, then ENTER it. Entering the print 
495 command will start the scroll. The advantage of doing it this 
496 way is that it takes you to the last message you read, not 
497 the last one you wrote. Hope you find this helpful. Gary

500 All this excitement. It's enough to bring a dead ninja back. I'm back
501 again and know have the stick shift to a '69 Chevy. If any one has the
502 stick to a '67 Ford I'd love to by it. At any rate., I'll go for the 
503 Bolos.

516 By all means, down load some pythons.  As they would say on

521 	"Bolos? NOW I remember! They are a form of something called a 'tank', 
522 aren't they?"
523 	"I believe the earlier models started at about 150 feet long. Hull armor
524 was something called 'durachrome'. (25mm was 'proof against any weapon short of
525 a contact nuclear blast'.) Of course, that was late 20th century weaponry they
526 meant....
527 	Firepower of the Mark IV was .5 megaton/second, but they didn't get 
528 intelligent until about Mark XXI (?)"
529 	As the others at the table looked at him in surprise, the bard explained,
530 "Just a few details I picked up. I have this fondness for war songs, even if I'm
531 not exactly fond of war zones!"
532 
533 	"As for the wizard, perhaps the apprentice can help us?"

535 DEAR FOTI-THE RUB WITH RUSSIA COMES FROM THEIR WANTING TO TAKE OVER NEIGH-
536 BORS.WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WITH THE BUCKS TO STOP THIS AND WE DON'T ALWAYS
537 THINK IT'S WORTH IT.
538 IT IS..LET THEM GET GERMANY,FRANCE,AND ITALY AND SEE IF WE AREN'T OVER A
539 BARREL TWO YEARS AFTER THAT.THEIR LEADERS SAY THAT'S THEIR GOAL AND WHY
540 NOT BELIEVE IT?WOULD THEY LIE??WITH NO NUKES WE WOULD BE IN FOR A ONE WEEK
541 WAR IN EUROPE(PROBABLY).SO WE TAKE THE LESSER OF EVILS.THE BEST SOLUTION IS
542 A RUSSIA THAT DOESN'T WANT TO EXPAND.HOW DO WE GET THAT??? --MR.PUZZELED

547  Mr Bard you are farely corect about the Bolo
548 tanke althow that have become so big the word 
549 that best discribs them is guganouth.  thay are 
550 very inteligent and defently seapent in the curent 
551 seares of models 
552   I would be willing to help at the used bolo lot
553 but Jonney and Tony might get mad if it is being 
554 run by the hairy fishnuts and the H.F.N. might get
555 run over by a very mad bolo mark XXII wich are BIG.
