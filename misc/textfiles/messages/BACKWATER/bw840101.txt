83 Big Bill:
84 
85 I'm so worried. I went to visit LeRoy over the Christmas 
86 holiday and he wasn't there. It was terrible. The prison 
87 officials not only denied that he'd been there but denied 
88 they ever heard of him.
89 
90 Oh, Bill, he's doing it again. This is exactly how it got 
91 started before.
92 
93 Do you remember a few years back when LeRoy was thrown into 
94 that Turkish prison? When they got him for some kind of 
95 involvement in the white slave trade out of Istanbul?
96 
97 Fifteen minutes before his trial he disappears. People who 
98 knew him for years suddenly never heard of him. His name 
99 disappears from the court docket. Suddenly no one knows, or 
100 has ever known, LeRoy McKane.
101 
102 Four days later he's implicated in a plot to assassinate 
103 that Bulgarian diplomat.
104 
105 I tell you, Bill, it's the same thing all over. I'm worried 
106 sick. Could you find LeRoy, talk to him. Make him promise to 
107 be careful...not to take too many risks.
108 
109 Do it for me, Bill, please, I won't ever ask anything of you 
110 again.

171      The barest of a flicker can still be seen in the ancient hanging
172 lantern, bravely shedding light despite its cage of ice, and the figure
173 peers closely in disbelief at the sign it illuminates.  
"Why yes," she
174 whispers, "it DOES indeed declare The Backwater Inn!"  She draws back
175 once again to gaze into one of the Inn's glowing windows.  "Yet--" with
176 voice disconsolate, her eyes wary:  "How crowded it is!  And...these
177 people are strangers to me, though they gibe and yammer just as if they
178 own the place!"  
She glances around the forest for reassurance--there,
179 white fire dances along the laden branches of a familiar oak, making
180 a mimic of the flame that brightens the window; here, a horse shifts
181 restlessly in the cobblestone courtyard, and the icicles on his hitching
182 post splinter with a brittle, tinkling noise from his movement.  
Her
183 eyes return, still reflecting uneasiness, to the spectacle of raucous
184 merry-making within the Inn...  
The silence that ensues is abrubtly
185 shattered by the heavy door being flung open, and several young fellows
186 stagger out, roaring merrily and leaning for support upon one another.
187 Eyes cautious, the girl melts into the shadows while they make their
188 departure reluctantly, flinging jeers at their compatriots who bellow
189 "Let the bloody door close!" and casting long shadows from the entrance.
190 
Her eyes follow them resentfully, and she wraps her cloak closer against
191 the searching wind.  
Quite suddenly, there is a rustle behind her--she
192 whirls, startled, and founders on the winter's treacherous ground--but
193 like quicksilver, hands reach out to steady her.  Abashed, the girl 
194 flushes and begins to mumble thanks, but is greeted by silvery laughter,
195 a sound so familiar and fresh:  "Pam!" she cries, and simultaneously
196 the Inn's door opens again, spreading a swath of light on the snow and
197 wafting the aroma of mouth-watering stew together in welcome!

281 I am th/oroughly amazed at 4the poor 
282 spelling on this BBS. Examples:
283 1) Plumb for plum tree.
284 2) Eye for the nautical affirmatiive aye.
285 N WE TALK?         SHALL I GO ON?
286 I think not! Surely the disk hasn't the
287 capacity for any more bad examples.
288 Maybe all of you bad spellers can get
289 together and buy copies of t'The Bad 
290 Spellers' Dictionary' in a case lot.
291 OR am I wrong? Maybe you spell in a
292 prevoiously unknown dialect of English...

297 
298 Hey, kid, take it easy...LeRoy's just fine. LeRoy's always 
299 just fine. He's got good connections and he's got big money. 
300 Don't sweat it.
301 
302 Let's take a closer look at the Bulgarian situation. Think 
303 about how LeRoy handled it.
304 
305 Oh sure, the CIA denied knowing him, the US government 
306 denounced him, but what happened then? I'll tell you. LeRoy 
307 retires to Venezuela with three quarters of a million dollars 
308 worth of pounds, rubles, and greenbacks.
309 
310 LeRoy's no fool. He's made his payoffs. He's cut his deals. 
311 He'll be back to laugh at your tears.
312 
313 Another thing, don't let LeRoy's posing as a used rug dealer 
314 get your hopes up. This is just a cover story he's using until 
315 he can catch the next ship out of Maracaibo.
316 
317 There's no way LeRoy's going to hang around a port city of 
318 400,000 people. He's either going to head for a city big 
319 enough to get lost in or a village remote enough to be safe. 
320 
321 Like I said, you don't need to worry about LeRoy; he knows how 
322 to take care of himself. He's been in tighter situations than 
323 this many times before. He has always survived and he always 
324 will. LeRoy McKane is nobody's fool. You just watch and see.

375 Whew...finally made it back to the inn. This weather hampered the operation
376 of my usual mode of transportation. Spinning tires in all 3 gears is great,
377 but only if it is on dry pavement.
378 Aaron...C U 2. Regarding the vaxhaker file, I think they already have it.
379 Also, to the chagrin of the root, people are starting to discover the games
380 account. More than 1 T.V. screen is lighting up to Worm and Rogue these
381 days. Next term will be a zoo down there, it will be interesting to see
382 just how busy it will get. Just the other day 'core full' errors started
383 showing up due to the numerous prolog groupies.
384 Any luck on finding that mystic. It sounds like you are getting quite a few

414      thing the government has done today raise their hands.              
415                                                                           
416      I see.  Almost unanimous.  Only a Bill McGowen voted no.  I thought
417      so.
418 
419 Enough ranting.
420 
421 Happy new year all, and when does school start ?   (Incidentally, 'ME'
422    the expression is 'you got another thinK coming', not thinG)

472 Rommel - Where did you go? I thought you were up for a fight.
473 Are you going to weasel out again? Maybe you're too busy
474 tapping phones? Question: What right does the government
475 have in telling me how to live my life? Telling me I can't
476 smoke pot, telling me what kind of sex I can have, telling
477 me what kind of medicine I can or can't take, Telling me
478 what kind of TV programs I can watch. Personally I don't
479 find this aceptable. I suppose you do?

518      Ach, the blush deepens with every compliment!  Pam, the eddies of
519 of the 'back waters' are keenly observed by at least one other, for your
520 idle fingers trailing in the stream oft leave a path of glittering gold,
521 as Mikey well knows!  Sir dROPPED bIT echoed the appreciation I couldn't
522 figure how to express (without sounding trite), when he revealed that
523 some of your well-designed essays were permanently inscribed on disk,
524 and shared proudly with friends!  Know, too, that your outrageous puns
525 provoke a smile, whether admitted or not, and an occasional chuckle...
526      DJJ, you flatter me!  Nay, my humble offerings are never committed
527 to paper in the old-fashioned manner:  they are inspired by the Inn and
528 its gentle folk, and here they will remain.  Nonetheless, I thank you,
529 sir, for words such as yours encourage what talent there is to flourish!
530      Alex, you rascal!  You have a talent for intruiging ambiguity, as
531 illustrated by your expression "Such....." that snatched my imagination,
532 plying it with possibilities--!  Never will I forget your first greeting
533 to me, the maddeningly inexplicable question you posed...a chortle yet
534 lingers in my mind when I remember...
535      Ah yes, Innkeeper:  the fame of your Inn was carried far and wide,
536 tantalizing the hearers like milkweed riding a playful wind.  Who could
537 hold back from chasing it?  But popularity has its price, for the Keeper
538 of the Inn has no rest from the bustling, changing crowd...I am honoured
539 to be the messenger that brings a small taste of tranquility, of vivid
540 colours, natural enchantment, and wood scents to our Backwater Inn...

550 BUT I DID GIVE THE CONCERNED TEACHER A CHEAP SHOT, AND MISSED MY OWN POINT
551 BE MORE CONCERNED WITH CONTENT RATHER THAN STYLE (My old gray-haired English
552 teacher would take me down and stuff "The Elements of Style" where the
553 sun never shines for that one) <SHUDDER!!!!>

556 
557 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
558 
559 MOHAMMED: PART OF THE PROBLEM IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE PURPOSE
560 OF THE INN AND ITS CONTENTS. BEING A PRINTED MEDIUM IT IS ASSUMED THAT IT
561 MUST FOLLOW THE RULES OF ALL PRINTED MEDIUM. THAT BEING THAT YOU MUST CHECK
562 RECHECK AND CHECK AGAIN THAT THE WRITING IS PERFECT BEFORE RELEASING IT TO
563 THE WORLD FOR CONSUMPTION. WHILE THIS MAY BE DESIRABLE IN SOME THINGS SUCH
564 AS THE WONDERFUL PICTURES THAT d PAINTS WITH WORDS, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY
565 SO IN OTHER THINGS SUCH AS THIS RANT. I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT THIS PARTICULAR
566 MEANS OF COMMUNICATION IS FORCED ON US BY THE FACT THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO
567 USE OUR VOICE, SO WE MUST REPLACE THAT VOICE WITH WORDS FLOWING ON A VIDEO
568 SCREEN. YET THE INFORMATION AND CONVERSATIONAL FLOW REMAIN THE SAME. YOU 
569 DON'T GO AROUND TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY AREN'T PRONOUNCING WORDS CORRECTLY
570 DO YOU? WE ACCEPT THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULTLY WITH LANGUAGE AND 
571 LEARN TO LISTEN TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY RATHER THEN HOW THEY SAY IT. INDEED
572 THAT IS ONE OF THE MARVELOUS FUNCTIONS OF OUR BRAINS, TO BE ABLE TO 
573 RECONSTRUCT A CONCEPT IN OUR OWN HEAD FROM THE CONFUSION OF SOUNDS COMING
574 OUT OF ANOTHERS. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE CARRIERS OF THIS 
575 INFORMATION (THE WORDS AND OTHERS ASPECTS OF COMMUNICATION) ARE NOT
576 IMPORTANT EITHER, IN FACT THEY CAN BE AS IMPORTANT AS THE IDEA ITSELF.
577 NOT INTHEMSELVES, BUT RATHER IN HOW THEY ARE PRESENTED. FOR THE FORM
578 THEY ARE PRESENTED IS A BASIC RELATIONSHIP TO THE CONCEPT ITSELF. IT 
579 TELLS YOU ABOUT THE PERSON THAT IS PROVIDING YOU THIS INFORMATION, AND
580 THEREBY ALLOWING YOU TO PROPERLY PLACE THE EMOTION AND DIRECTION OF WHAT
581 HAS BEEN SAID. THIS INCLUDES MISSPELLING AND GRAMACTICAL ERRORS, I DO NOT
582 RUSH TO A DICTIONARY EVERY TIME I WRITE DOWN A WORD BECAUSE IF I DID THAT,
583 I WOULD BREAK THE FLOW OF THOUGHT OF WHAT I AM SAYING. I COULD GO BACK
584 AND EDIT WHAT I WROTE, BUT I DON'T SEE THE POINT. I GOT MY IDEA ACROSS,
585 AND THAT IS WHAT I WAS AFTER. GOING BACK AND CHECKING EACH AND EVERY WORD
586 WOULD TO ME BE A WORTHLESS WASTE OF TIME. I HAVE MUCH BETTER THINGS TO DO
587 WITH MY TIME. THIS WRITING WILL NOT STAY HERE FOREVER, IN A MOMENTS PASSING
588 IT WILL BE GONE NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. IF I AM GOING TO WRITE SOMETHING
589 THAT WILL BE AROUND AWHILE AND THAT WILL READ AGAIN AND AGAIN, THEN I DO
590 INDEED TAKE TIME TO CHECK MY WORK, BUT THAT IS WRITING, NOT CONVERSATION
591 AS WE ARE SPEAKING OF HERE. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE.

593 
596 ODD.. I'M SURE THAT THAT LAST LINE WASN'T THERE BEFORE.
597 WELL, HERE IT IS AGAIN, DRIVE A ALMOST FULL AND NO ONE HAS FINISHED OFF 
598 DRIVE B YET. I AM JUST ABOUT READY TO SAY THE HECK WITHIT ALL AND
599 EITHER LEAVE IT IN DRIVE A UNTIL IT DOES FILL UP (THOUGH I AM SURE
600 THAT I WOULD GET NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT NOT CHANGING DISKS FAST
601 ENOUGH), OR TO SAY THE HECK WITH IT AND ARCHIVE THE THING ANYWAY AS IS.
602 THIS IS JUST ALL SO BORING TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING TO SAY TO
603 FILL THIS UP.
604 GAD! 26 MORE LINES TO GO!
605 I DON'T THINK I CAN LAST THAT LONG.
606 I WONDER WHY NOBODY SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT DRIVE B?
607 IT IS HERE FOR THE USING.
608 I WONDER HOW MANY EVEN CARE OR THINK
609 ABOUT DRIVE B? MANY COME HERE WHEN IT
610 IS FIRST MOVED, BUT THEY THEN SOON 
611 FORGET THAT IT IS HERE AND COME NO MORE.
612 <SIGH> HOW SOON THEY FORGET.
613 SINCE I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING TO WRITE, 
614 I THINK I'LL JUST LEAVE IT HERE FOR A BIT AND
615 SEE IF ANYBODY ELSE WILL FINISH IT OFF.

620      MIKEY, THAT EMPTY LINE WAS MY FAULT.  I CALLED UP AND WAS GOING TO FILL
621 THIS DISK UP, BUT WHEN I STARTED TO ENTER, SOMEONE CAME TO THE DOOR AND I
622 HAD TO HANG-UP.  I CARE ABOUT THIS DISK, THOUGH IT SEEMS FEW OTHERS DO.  I
623 THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE NEWER USERS DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET HERE (OR
624 DON'T CARE) OR THEY WANT THEIR WORDS TO BE OBVIOUS TO EVERY USER THAT CALLS
625 AND USES THE "LIST" COMMAND.
626      THIS IS A TEST.  EVERYONE THAT SEES THIS PLEASE RESPOND BY SAYING "YES,
627 I SAW IT PAM!" OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.  I'LL TRY THIS AS OFTEN AS I CAN.
