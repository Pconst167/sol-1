28 L'homme: now what didya hafta go and say that for?!? NOW i have to think up
29         something else! did you and MF&E make PorSFiS? did I????????
30 
31 ALL (again): how many BWMS users have 1200 baud modems? how many would chip
32             in $$$ for a BWMS 1200 baud modem?? how many are reading this??
33 
34 MiG: I think its sold. Lemme know if your intrested if this guy pulls out.
35 L'homme (again): what is your connection with OGC's SA?
36 HAWTHORNE/ZZZIPSTER/SYNTHETIC MOTHER/: will call as soon as I have time.
37 Milchar: No one here seems to play chess...
38 HERR BACH: ditto on "theory", yes? (re: misuse of 'myth')
39 L'homme (again) & MF&E: sang-froid... "sang", i believe is Korean for "yang"
40                        and thus would mean "emptiness"? or "non-existence"?
41                        ahhh! sang-froid, aka no-8th!   right??
42                        but what is a "garder"?

48 sang-froid means to keep one's head...get it? I don't know any Korean,
49 although I know a cute Korean at PSU. What did I say? Did I give something
50 away? Yiii yiii yiii! Yes of course M F & E went to the meeting today, which
51 besides us was only attended (in a backwater sense) by voyeur and MIG (
52 who wore grey again!). We adjourned to the P C & S before things got too
53 weird at the meeting, plus we were disgusted that YOU didn't show up!
54 Then while MF & E and I were walking back to the B of T B we were side
55 tracked be multitudes of young nubile "wavos and trendies" (I had to use
56 those terms...kudos to the originator on this system) who were watching
57 the break dance competition in the Pioneer square. (The view of the dancing
58 wasn't too good, which was fine with me...there were plenty of other things
59 to look at.) What ever happened to your pro punk argument? I am still
60 waiting for your first message on that subject...My connection with OGC's
61 SA...well this might surprise you, but we all have our little secrets...and
62 while I may not be on the H. network, I do have connections at Tek #50
63 and my uncle back East is a good friend of a guy name Cray. Do the letters
64 XM-P mean anything to you? You are still avoiding the chess problem...Are
65 you really afraid? Do you notice that our 'great' adventure is turning
66 into another changling or Harry's women Star Trek episode. 'Logic is a

90 I was cruising well out to sea when the call came.  It was a kind of 
91 telepathic yell that blanked half of the upper band and garbled half the
92 arguement that Hyronimus had made to refute Hawkings theory concerning
93 the evaporation of quantum black holes.  We all recoiled in shock, then
94 agreed that someone should investigate it.  I had a sense that somehow a
95 reality shift was involved.  By carefully refining the distortions to my
96 perception, I localted an anomaly somewhere up the Columbia river.  As I
97 was the closest, I put on a burst of speed and headed up river.
98   The river had changed quite a bit since the last time I had been here.
99 These humans are an energetic bunch.  Within a coulple of centuries they
100 can transform a rich, productive ecosystem into total chaos.  Pershaps we
101 should really take a hand.  One small plague would really thin things out...
102   My goodness, this water is foul.  What kinds of things have they put 
103 in it?  (chemoreceptors in my sides go into action)  ugh!  That plague
104 seems more useful all the time.
105   I'm getting closer to the area of distortion.  It seems to be on the 
106 river and moving.  What luck!! I really didn't like the idea of trying
107 to move on land.  I would be terribly stiff for days afterward.
108   Ahh -- I'm in sight of it.  The distortion seems to be coming from a 
109 strange watercraft.  Just as I thought -- humans.  They are a pesky lot,
110 although the're kinda cute.  I hope we don't have to sterilize this place
111 and start over.  Oh look at that, one of the little fellows is trying to
112 defent the rest.  Nessie would like to see this, it's dressed like those
113 of Nessie's.  Well, let's see what's on it's little mind.  Ahh, yes, these
114 are from an alternate reality.  Well, if it want's to begin communication
115 by discussing religion, that seems to mitigate their warlike tendencies.
116 Let's keep this trivial until I can adjust to their means of communicaton.

169 nearby.  `Hmmmm...` he says, `I think that that spell wasn't quite right.`
170 He gathers all of his worldly goods and places them in pockets located
171 here and there on his robes.  He sighs. `Now I`ll have to find a way out
172 of here, and back home.`  He begins to wave his wand, tracing ancient

287 FOR SO HE FELT;AND HE WAS ONLY AS OLD
288 AS HALF A CENTURY OF SERENITY
289 HAD MADE HIM.AS A MAN DESERVING THEM,
290 HE GLOWED WITH HONORS EARNED.HE WAS APART,
291 BECAUSE BEING WHO HE WAS,AND AS HE WAS,
292 HIS NATURAL STATION WOULD       INEVITABLY
293 BE SOMEWHAT ON AN EMINENCE,LIKE HIS HOUSE.
294 APPROACHIBLE YET CLEARLY AT A DISTANCE,
295 MATTHIAS WAS IN HARMONY WITH HIS HOUSE,
296 AND ALL ELSE THAT INTERSTED HIM.
297 HE WAS IN HARMONY THIS AFTERNOON
298 EVEN WITH CHOAS;AND FROM WHERE HE SAT,
299 ALL HE COULD SEE WAS HIS.THERE WAS NO SKY
300 IN THE WOOD SHADOWED AND FORESAKEN GORGE
301 WWHERE HE WAS NOW,BUT THERE WOULD BE A SKY
302 WHEN HE CAME OUT.MATTHIAS LOVED THE SUN
303 BETTER THAN SHADOWS,AND THE MORE FOR THEM
304 WHEN HE CAME OUT.DOWN THERE IT WAS IMPRESSIVE,
305 IF NOT FOR LONG ALLURING.MIGHTY ROCKS,
306 LIKE A MISSHAPEN CITY THAT WAS DEAD,
307 WERE MONSTEROUS ES WERE AFRAID
308 OF THEM,AND TO A STRAIGHTNESS AND A HEIGHT
309 THAT WOULD NOT ELSEWHERE HAVE BEEN THEIRS THRUST UP
310 THEIR TOPS TO FIND THE SUN.SOMEWHERE ABOVE HIM,
311 THERE WAS A HOUSE;AND SOMEWHERE IN HIS HOUSE
312 WAS NATALIE.SO MATTHIAS HAD NO FEAR
313 TO CONTEMPLATE A FREINDLY RETROSPECT
314 OF A GOOD LIFE WITH NO DISASTERS IN IT,
315 AND NO INFIRM MISTAKES.HE HAD DONE WELL,
316 WHEREFORE HE WAS A GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT.
317 GOD ASKED OF HIM NO MORE;AND HE WOULD ASK
318 NO MORE OF GOD THAN WAS ALREADY GIVEN.
319 HE SMILED WITH GRATITUDE,NOT    VANITY,
320 TO THINK OF THAT.A BROOK SOMEWHERE UNSEEN
321 MADE A COLD SONG OF ETERNITY
322 THAT WOULD ALWAYS BE COLD,AND ALWAYS DARK,
323 AND FAR FROM HIS DESIRE.HAVING A RIGHT
324 TO SMILE AT WHAT HE WOULD,HE SMILED AT THAT
325 AND WAS CONTENT-WHEN HE HEARD,SUDDENLY,
326 MORE THAN A BROOK,HE STARTED AND STOOD UP,
327 STRAINING HIS EYES TO SEE WHAT HE HAD HEARD;
328 FOR HE HA HEARD THE SOUND OF COMING FEET
329 THAT WERE THE UNINITED FEET OF MAN,
330 PROWLING WHERE NONE SHOULD BE.MATTHIAS FROWNED,
331 WITH AN EYE NOT EAGER TO MEET A SHAPE
332 APPROACHING HIM THAT WAS AT FIRST A STRANGER,
333 BUT SOON WAS ONE THAT HE MIGHT RECOGNIZE
334 WITHOUT ALARM OR WRATH.

412 integration over dy/dx... Chez MF & E sounds fine, but I have some special

445 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
446   Detecting the look of interest on the creature's face, the piper began
447 the conversation.  Several barrels of beer down the creature's throat 
448 had the piper sweating to keep up.  Another hour and the piper knew that
449 his best logic could be easily chopped to shreds.  Knowing that defeat
450 was inevetable, the piper slipped his dirk loose in the sheath.  Dinner
451 he might be, but he was going to do his damnedest to cause indigestion!
452   Suddenly the afternood grew distant.  A loud buzzing sounded in his head
453 and the edges of his vision darkened.  A vast silence enveloped him and then
454 a voice -- similar  to a telepathic message but **MUCH** louder -- filled
455 his mind.
456    ##HOW CUTE!  YOU ARE QUITE A FIERCE LITTLE CREATURE, AREN'T YOU?  YOU
457 REALLY NEEDN'T SNARL QUITE SO FIERCELY, I REALLY HAVE NO INTENTION OF EATIG
458 YOU OR YOUR COMPANIONS.  I DO ENJOY YOUR NATTERING ON ABOUT RELIGION, 
459 HOWEVER MISPLACED YOUR OUTLOOK.  YOU HAVE REALIZED THAT YOU ARE MUCH MORE
460 THAN YOU SEEM, BUT HAVE YET TO REALIZE THAT YOU ARE MUCH LESS THAN YOU 
461 IMAGINE.  I, ON THE OTHER HAND AM MUCH LESS THAN I SEEM, AND MUCH MORE THAN
462 YOU IMAGINE.  HOWEVER, SINCE YOU WANT TO GO UPSTREAM, I'LL MOVE YOU ALONG.##
463   The piper watched in amazement as the great creature wrapped the craft in 
464 a coil of his immense body.  The engine rose in a scrill scream, then 
465 quieted as the propeller was stripped of it's blades.  A slight lurch was
466 the only effect as the craft left the water, but the piper worried abot
467 the tightness of the hull in the water again.  In the quiet, a pressure
468 seemed to push the piper to the rear of the craft.  Wind rose faster and
469 faster until he went to door to seek shelter.  Inside he heard someone ask
470 the question "What about the dam?" and a terrified yell from someone who
471 was on lookout -- the massive structure was in sight.  Resolving to see
472 the accident that killed him, the piper moved to a window for a better view.
473   Many yards ahead, the head of the creature came out of the water, followed
474 by the immense span of the creature's neck and body.  Great gleaming canopys
475 of iridescent colors issued from the creature's sides and the entire beast
476 rose into the air with the watercraft still settled into a coil of it's
477 body.  ## NOW ISN'T THAT MUCH EASIER , ITTLE CREATURE?##

486 Aha Aaron...you defend the little people...how...amusing!...The
487 "arena bait"...possibly from 'Bread and Circuses'? You have yet to
488 answer "Death to Zeon!" That first special kiss was on 'Plato's Step
489 children'... Got any more questions? As for these books, although I 
490 have seen them in bookstores, I have refrained from buying them also. 
491 I can't stand B. J. Trumbell (or whatever her name is). And David

592  
593      I've arrived at my home deep in the wood, and alas! even here I find
594 that my absence has led to trouble.  There is so much dust, the yard is in
595 disrepair, weeds have overgrown the flowerbeds; only the fence and the
596 sturdy shutters on my windows remain as solid as before, denying entrance
597 to all who come to close.  The fence and shutters are relatively new
598 additions to this home, coinciding only by coincidence with my earliest
599 entrance to this land, and their presence is disturbing to some.... some
600 whom I value as friends.  I can only hope that they will see them not as
601 blockades erected to ward them off, but as protection for myself against
602 the darkness that awaits without.
603  
604      Having cleaned, straightened, weeded, cut, and cleared, I think of the
605 excusion party moving eastward and upstream.  Are they going to Goldendale
606 and the New Henge?  If they intend to return here it would be a good place
607 to cast their runes, though its power is only through sympathy to the
608 original rather than through itself.  There seems to be enough power amoung
609 them to transfer those without the ability to transfer themselves, so my
610 own insubstantial help is not needed there.  Besides, I have always drawn
611 more strength from Avebury, Silbury Hill, and the West Kennet Long Barrows
612 than from the Henge.
613  
614      I look about myself, and see that things have been returned to a small
615 measure of order, so perhaps I will join them anyway!  If Goldendale is
616 their destination, I'll await them there, and if not, I'll draw some warmth
617 from the effigy of elder days.

624 PAM - It is being locked out in that very backness that troubles. The cold
625 chills to the bone. There is no warmth of a flame to brighten the way. It
626 is a jungle of fear and lonlyness like unto an unmowed lawn. Is this fear
627 then so great? Do these walls gather strength? Or are they but a temporary
628 barrier that in time like the walls of Jerico soon to come tumbling down?
