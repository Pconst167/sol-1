 30                    Green Marketing  April 1990
 31    Green marketing is sweeping the country. Marketers discovered there is  
 32 money to be made by wrapping products in environmental claims. The not-so-
 33 subtle message is: "Buy our products and help save the world." 
 34  
 35             WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF GREEN MARKETING PITCHES?
 36    Laundry detergent boxes proudly proclaim they are made from recycled paper. 
 37 Trash bags claim to be degradable. A grocery chain touts its private label  
 38 cooking spray as environmentally friendly because it has no  
 39 chlorofluorocarbons - blamed for eating a hole in the Earth's protective ozone 
 40 layer. A half dozen oil companies this year introduced in limited test markets 
 41 premium gasolines formulated to reduce emissions. 
 42  
 43          ARE CONSUMERS INFLUENCED BY A COMPANY'S ENVIRONMENTAL STANCE?
 44    Three of every four Americans said a company's environmental reputation  
 45 affects what they buy, according to a poll conducted last summer for the  
 46 Michael Peters Group in New York. 
 47  
 48               WHAT IS THIS TREND DOING TO THE ADVERTISING MARKET?
 49    Expect more advertising appealing to environmental concerns. For several  
 50 years, the American Marketing Association's theme has been that marketing  
 51 makes a good life better. This year, the sub-theme was green marketing, said  
 52 Jeff Heilbrunn, president of the Chicago-based trade association. "Marketing  
 53 reflects society, and they are saying at this moment that they want these  
 54 things," he said. 
 55  
 56               WHAT DOES GREEN MARKETING MEAN IN CONSUMER COSTS?
 57    This heightened corporate interest in the environment comes at a price to  
 58 consumers, experts say. Because consumers are willing to pay more, prices of  
 59 some products have gone up with the addition of an environmental label, though 
 60 the product might not cost more to manufacture. In some industries, increased  
 61 environmental regulation and public protests caused prices to jump. 
 62  
 63               ARE COMPANIES CONCERNED WITH MISLEADING CLAIMS?
 64     "I fear exploitation," said Mary Ellen Burris, spokeswoman for Wegmans  
 65 Food Markets, a New York chain, explaining that misleading claims would erode  
 66 consumer confidence. 
 67  
 68             HAS GREEN MARKETING RESULTED IN CONFUSING LABELING?
 69    Yes. And some companies are backing off their claims. Mobil Chemical Co.,  
 70 for example, is deleting the "degradable" labels on its Hefty plastic bags  
 71 because of "the growing confusion about the meaning and value of  
 72 degradability," spokesman Allen Gray said. The composition of the bags will  
 73 remain the same. 
 74  
 75                   WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM WITH MOBIL'S CLAIM?
 76    Mobil began making its plastic bags with an additive that speeds the bags'  
 77 decomposition when exposed to sunlight. But in a landfill, where most bags end 
 78 up, very little actually degrades. 
 79  
 80                  ARE MOST GREEN MARKETING CLAIMS TRUTHFUL?
 81    Some environmental claims cannot be substantiated, while others are  
 82 overstated and misleading because no government agency or trade association  
 83 regulates or defines environmental labeling. Too many environmental claims are 
 84 more sizzle than steak, said Edwin S. Rothschild, energy and environmental  
 85 policy director of Citizen Action group in the District of Columbia. "A lot of 
 86 companies are claiming things about their products that are not true," he  
 87 said. 
 88  
 89                     HOW ABOUT SHELL'S NEW PREMIUM GAS CLAIM?
 90    Shell's new premium gasoline, SU2000E, is better than its previous  
 91 gasolines, but only marginally, Rothschild said. "The company spent more time  
 92 preparing its marketing and advertising than in preparing the gasoline," he  
 93 said. "People shouldn't get the idea that they will have clean air after  
 94 burning the stuff" in their vehicles. 
 95  
 96           WHAT HAVE SOME OTHER COMPANIES BEEN DOING IN TERMS OF LABELING?
 97    Wal-Mart last summer launched a program that includes tagging merchandise  
 98 that is environmentally friendly. For example, Ivory Snow laundry detergent  
 99 and Charmin toilet tissue are tagged for their packaging made of recycled  
100 material. The chain asked suppliers to offer more recycled or recyclable  
101 products, said spokeswoman Jane Arend, but she said Wal-Mart would not boycott 
102 an uncooperative vendor. Additionally, Wal-Mart uses only paper bags in its  
103 stores, has a recycling program at its company headquarters in Bentonville,  
104 Ark., and is testing in-store recycling centers. 
105  
106              ARE THERE ANY COMPANIES WHO HAVE SHUNNED LABELING?
107    Wegmans Food Markets will not mark or identify environmental products on  
108 its shelves. "We want to be very cautious of the claims. New information is  
109 developing daily," spokeswoman Burris said. Marketing is the quickest and most 
110 visible response to consumer interest, but more meaningful developments take  
111 longer and are not always as noticeable, she said, citing the efforts of  
112 orange juice producer Tropicana. 
113  
114                          WHAT HAS TROPICANA DONE?
115    The Florida company is redesigning its juice jugs so that only one type of  
116 plastic resin is used, rather than layers of different resins. This allows the 
117 jugs to be recycled more easily. In Tropicana's case, the plastic will make it 
118 back to shelves as motor oil containers. 
119  
120              ARE AMERICANS READY TO MAKE ENVIRONMENTAL SACRIFICES?
121    Despite growing public interest in the environment, "it remains to be seen  
122 whether Americans are ready to make the sacrifice, pocketbook-wise ad  
123 convenience-wise," said Heilbrunn of the American Marketing Association. But  
124 as long as consumers express an interest in the environment, green marketing  
125 is here to stay. Said Rothchild: Corporations can read the polls as well as  
126 anyone else.
127 ===========================================================================
128                DEBATE - EARTH DAY 1990: USA TODAY'S OPINION:
129    If all goes as hoped, 100 million people will gather Sunday in 140  
130 countries ... The occasion is Earth Day 1990 ... The people of the United  
131 States dished out $1 trillion over two decades in taxes and higher prices to  
132 make things right. ... Today, fixing the environment is no longer just a  
133 problem for one city, or one region, or even one nation. It is a problem for  
134 the world. 
135  
136 OTHER VIEWS:
137    THOMAS DEGREGORI, economist at the University of Houston: Earth Day  
138 reflects legitimate concerns about environmental problems. Unfortunately, it  
139 is being used as a "consciousness-raising" vehicle for an action agenda  
140 detrimental to the well-being of Earth's inhabitants. ... Earth Day advocates  
141 express concerns we all share, but it would be folly to follow their  
142 prescriptions. 
143  
144    PATRICK COX, associate policy analyst for the Competitive Enterprise  
145 Institute: The Earth Day mentality is not only shallow and uninformed, it  
146 wastes resources on festivities and posturing that could have been put to good 
147 use solving real environmental problems.
148  
149    PETER DYKSTRA, Greenpeace: "Companies are using concern for the environment 
150 as a marketing tool to sell pollution. Instead of cleaning up their act, they  
151 are cleaning up their PR by wrapping themselves in the green flag." 
152  
153    WILLIAM REILLY, EPA administrator: "This country has a lot of work to do to 
154 cut down the pollution we produce." 
155  
156    CAMANCHE, IOWA, Juleen Barrows, 56, bank teller: I have not done a lot for  
157 the environment because I don't know how I can help. In our community, there  
158 is very little talk about the environment. I think it will take time before  
159 everyone gets together. Businesses and individuals must get involved. I hope  
160 that Earth Day will get people concerned. 
161  
162    TOLEDO, OHIO, Evelyn Hayes, 44, factory worker: The environment is a top  
163 concern. I am concerned about my kids and their kids. Whatever we can do now  
164 will help them later. I try to help by separating my trash for recycling.  
165 There are other issues, like the air quality, which affect everyone. Chemical  
166 plants must do their share to clean up the air. 
167  
168    ARLINGTON, TEXAS, John Jesme, 29, electronic technician: I realize that we  
169 abuse our planet, and I worry about my children and their future. I try to  
170 live in areas with less pollution for the health of my family. We are not  
171 planning anything special for Earth Day. You just can't set aside one day for  
172 the Earth. You've got to do it own a continuous basis. 
173  
174    BROOKLYN, N.Y., Robert Chan, 52, retired motorman: We should have started  
175 this recycling business a long time ago. The problems with the ozone layer  
176 could have been avoided. We sort our trash for recycling. I know that a  
177 miracle is not going to happen overnight. But all people must do their part. 
178  
179    SEATTLE, WASH., John Thorp, 47, school principal: We have got to do  
180 something to change this around for the welfare of the collective society.  
181 Many people have difficulty looking down the road. The environmental movement  
182 is doing a lot to counter the "me mentality," which is why I support the  
183 movement. This issue really needs to be a global concern. 
184  
185    HIGHLAND PARK, Debbie Lyman, 30, homemaker: I am a member of Greenpeace, so 
186 I'm aware of what is going on with our environment. I am mainly concerned  
187 about the children. The Earth was here for us. I just hope it will be there  
188 for them. I worry about air pollution, the ozone, and the future of our  
189 wetlands, which is home for many animals.
190                                                                                
191    So,  now that  Earth Day 1990  has come and gone,   what are   YOU   doing
192 for the environment???

233 version of the T2500 (just released) supports the most stringent standards
234 for error recovery (some of the V.42 stuff) - I believe it is a ROM upgrade

290      "How can you be so sure we're      inside a Triangle, Standor?"
291      The avian regarded Michael, his    amber eyes reflecting mock injury.
292 'Michael, my sensor bands would seem    to indicate that we've reached the
293 exact coordinates of a Stone Triangle,  and yet have shifted dimensionally.    
294 I am unable to pierce the dimensional   barrier of this environment, and as

299 churning whirlwind that had taken       them to this bizarre world of two suns.

309      "Stop that..." Michael snapped     under his breath.

362  
363  
364  
365      %Then all goes well, Yl'Ben?%  The voice was tinged with dripping
366 sarcasm and the sibilance of escaping   steam.  %Surely it must...%
367      Yl'Ben ignored his partner's       overtones.  +As well as can be
368 expected, considering our template.     True, the presence  of the damnable    
369 Nemesis could have kept the Vortex      running much more smoothly, but at the
370 very least the Quantier is secured in   the Triangle.+
371      %Along with the Nemesis.%
372      +Win some, lose some, Dwin.+
373      %I still don't like it.  Even if   they are trapped, Michael is still
374 resourceful.%
375      +Frightened?+ a smirk crossed      Yl'Ben's features.
376      %Concerned for the security of     the project.  Lord knows we've had a
377 difficult enough time dealing with      the Pyrrixian Technocracy Astrologers, 
378 let alone DIM-Runners and aliens        leading the permutations astray.  The  
379 last thing we need is to bring a Time   Nemesis right into the middle of a     
380 paradox of this magnitude.%
381      +Poetic justice.+
382      %We'd be safer if he were still    helplessly scouring the planet in his  
383 asteroid.%
384      Yl'Ben ran a gloved hand through   his tousled blonde hair.  +Calm
385 yourself.  You've looked at the         readings as closely as I  have.  The   
386 process has already begun.  Our         plants have been leading Friar to the  
387 Pool, and the Desert Tower has          resurfaced.  The paradox flows, my     
388 earstwhile ally.+
389      Dwim regarded the calculations     on his own monitor.  %And accounting
390 for the human factor, there's still a   -high- probability that something may
391 turn awry.%
392      +We'll deal with that-+
393      %-When the moment comes...%        Dwim finished, disgusted.  %A pathetic 
394 attitude.  And then there's the matter  of PPyrrix itself.%
395      Yl'Ben's eyes widened in mock      horror.  +God above, I hope that the
396 PATRIOTS don't find me!+
397      %There is more to this paradox     than one might initially suspect...%
398      +If you're referring to Pyrrix's   attracting so many outworlders, then
399 rest easy.  Granted, they've thrown     off matters, but we've been gearing    
400 things back on course.  So far, the     only unforseen incident was when 
401 the Nemesis killed the vagrant in the   alleyway.+
402      Dwim started suddenly. %Did you    run readings on it?%
403      +Anomaly.  Nothing more.  Probably due to Michael's divergent thought
404 pattern... the systems can't really     compensate for an individual whose mind
405 is as sharply divided between subtle    extremes as Michael's.+
406      %Translation?%
407      +Michael was out of sorts.+
408      %Not good enough.  What about the  shift that the Nemesis went through 
409 during the course of his exploits.  It  seemed to begin at about the time that 
410 the Quantier moved him from Friar's     proximity for the first time.%
411      +Again, an anoaly, probably due   to the presence of the paradox.+
412      %We MUST ensure that the Nemesis   does NOT have the opportunity to 
413 rationalize the Vortex!% Dwim snapped.
414      +Again, how can he?  He hasn't     the tools or materials to create the
415 Quantier...+

573 I cleared out peaceably before lunchtime.  Public Radio was having some
574 sort of pledge on the way home.  I thought about stopping by a telephone
575 booth on the way back and pledging some amount of dollars, but then
576 decided it was too dangerous to pull over to the side of the road (there
577 are a couple of phones across from the fire station).  After being home
578 for a while, I forgot about Public Radio.  
579  
580 That night I sat on a bench in the back yard, watching the stars
581 overhead.  There seemed to be an unusual number of shooting stars on
582 this night.  That reminded me of the 'near miss' with an asteriod we had
583 earlier this year.  I'd overheard that an astrophysicist at JPL believes
584 we have entered an unusually dirty part of the galaxy and can expect to
585 see more near misses until we are through this galactic asteriod belt. 
586 One object even survived its fiery passage through the atmosphere and
587 exploded over Siberia, a mere 80 years ago, causing substantial damage. 
588 There I go, always telling you everything, even about things that are
589 not even published (don't even know if this one is really even true
590 since I did not talk with the astophysicist personally).  Someone out
591 there probably hates me for it.  Maybe that's the real reason why I'm on
592 three months of probation.
593  
594 I pulled out a pencil (yes, I do not need a computer to write) and began
595 composing a letter.
596  
597 Priscilla:
598 First of all, I've always wanted to tell you that, for such a beautiful
599 woman, your name stinks.  I realize your real name is something like
600 Chen Hao-Cheih Koshito and that most people in the West aren't up to
601 pronouncing something like that.  In fact, most people from Japan and
602 China probably have difficulties with it since it is a mixture of both
603 cultures, as you are.  Anyway, I KNOW you picked that name before coming
604 over her because you thought it had something to do with something nice
605 like "Princess".  Well, it doesn't.  The name stinks and you should
606 discard it for one more suitable.  We can work on it together, if you
607 like.
608  
609 By the way, Howy thinks it is absolutely hilarious that you want to have
610 a name which sounds like 'princess'.
611  
612 The second thing is Bob.  Bob thinks the other kids his age are morons
613 for good reason.  They are.  I don't know if you realize this, but he
614 had no business entering the first grade this year.  Any 6 year old who
615 reads 'Finnegans Wake' (and is smart enough to admit he doesn't
616 understand it-please tell him to stop fretting the importance of
617 expressing 'allspace in a notshall' unless he specifically intends to
618 go nuts) and does elementry algebra does not belong in the first
619 grade.  I realize he took that test which was supposed to place him
620 appropriately, but you must be aware that he had no chance to pass it at
621 all after he called the Test Administrator a "miserable cretin".  Bob
622 might be smart, but he does not know how to get along in society.  You
623 will not survive very well in this society by calling Test
624 Administrators "cretins".
625  
626 Maybe it's time to get to the point.  I am writing you tonight because I
627 am lonely.  Something very terrible happened today.  I got fired.  Well,
628 that's really not true.  I am on 3 months probation due to our little
629 incident at Frizby's.  They might as well have fired me, though.  After
630 the 3 months are over, they will run some more tests on me.  If I pass,
631 things are back to normal.  If I don't, I'm on the street.  Not a good
632 prospect...
633  
634 I am also writing you because I am angry (or, if you will excuse me,
635 PI**ED!) at your father for withholding the rest of the TOI papers. 
636 Please tell him that what he has is a collection of worthless
637 mathematical games unless he releases them for everyone in the world to
638 analyze and verify.  They could be very important, but 'could be's' are
639 meaningless.  Remember that precious vase you told me you saw in Mainland
640 China once?  Remember you said that it is not possible to reproduce the
641 vase with any materials known to us today?  The reason the vase cannot
642 be reproduced is that the selfish idiot who originally produced it
643 didn't carefully document the process.  Hiding knowledge is the way of
644 ancient China.  As you have said, the Western man's greatest misgiving is
645 that he talks so much and says so little.  However, he says everything
646 (and, unfortunately, more) that he is aware of-there are no secrets. 
647 I'd like to say he does this because he realizes that knowledge must
648 change hands to become valuable, in exactly the same way that money must
649 change hands in order to have any value.  The ancient Chinese and
650 Japanese hid their technologies, they horded them, because they believed
651 knowledge was power.  Wouldn't it be nice if there were a thousand such
652 vases in the world today, in places where everyone could see them? 
653 Alas, that will not happen because the process died with its selfish
654 originator. 
655  
656 If your father is holding onto the TOI papers because he believes that
657 knowledge is power, please tell him he is being foolish.  The papers are
658 absolutely worthless unless they are scrutinized.  It is very likely
659 they must be scrutinized while Dr. Samatsi is still alive so that we can
660 discuss our concerns in earnest with this brilliant man.
661  
662 I didn't even mean to mention this in this letter.  There are many other
663 things I want to talk to you about.  However, I've always had trouble
664 talking with women.  That is the only reason I've never gotten married. 
665 Never could seem to say the right things.  First of all, I want to say
666 thanks for helping Howy get me home that night.  I know you risked your
667 job by doing that and appreciate you very much so.
668  
669 Second of all, I want to say thank you for being with me in the hospital
670 and sticking by me when it looked like I had done something very
671 terrible.  What I told you before is true: I have never taken drugs in
672 my life.  Let me caveat that.  In my younger days, I smoked marijuana
673 about 10 times.  That might shock you, considering the culture you are
674 from, but let me assure you it was quite common in the late 1960's to
675 smoke marijuana.  To be frank with you, I never did like it because it
676 made me cough a lot and didn't make me feel particularly pleasant at
677 all.  That's probably why I never smoke cigarettes, either.  Anyway, I
678 honestly do not understand what happened that night, but suspect someone
679 drugged my beer for a joke.  That joke might have cost me my livelihood.
680  
681 Why did I smoke marijuana then?  To be with friends.  To be with
682 friends then was so different than it is now.  No one had to prove
683 anything, if you didn't want to smoke, it was okay.  This whole concept
684 of friendship was more important to us than our attire, appearance, or
685 philosophy.  We had hard core conservatives, wild eyed liberals,
686 ecological maniacs, religious wierdos, and just about anyone else you could
687 imagine.  What bound us together was the communal need for togetherness.
688 There is no word for this need.  Perhaps you can teach me some Japanese
689 some day-maybe that culture has a word for this human need.
690  
691 Over the last twenty years, Americans have cloaked this need-they hide
692 from it.  Probably they wallowed in it for so long that they neglected
693 their material needs.  Now that we've pretty much gone about as far as
694 we can on the material gamut, things will probably begin to swing back. 
695 I see that in my neighbors, sometimes.  When I first moved here (my
696 house was the first in this section to be completed, by the way), we
697 were harshly critical and intolerant of one another.  Now we are 
698 beginning to act like we need each other, despite the wide diversity of
699 individual backgrounds and cultures in this little neighborhood.  
700  
701 This turn of events makes me wonder if society is not changing.  For
702 several millennia, perhaps for as long as written history, military
703 spending has dominated government budgets.  When military spending did
704 not dominate a government's budget (such as the 'redirected' funds of
705 the Ching dynasty which wound up landscaping the family garden), the
706 government collapsed due to invasion.  I am not a historian, but this
707 generally seems to be the case.  However, now we are not being invaded
708 by other countries; in fact, most civilized countries realize that
709 military means are the most undesirable approach to securing another
710 country's resource.  The violent threat today is from terriorism, not
711 from standing armies.  Already, at least two airliners have been blown
712 out of the air this year and many hundreds (if not thousands) of
713 innocent lives lost in this terrorist war.
714  
715 Funny, when starting that paragraph, I was leading up to the point that
716 we don't need armies anymore.  After writing it, I became convinced
717 otherwise.  It is like deciding what the result of an equation is in
718 advance and then being surprised by the actual result.
719  
720 But the planned/calculated destruction of life has always seemed so
721 wasteful to me.  Would you destroy a field of diamonds? Would you send a
722 boat full of gold to the bottom of the sea? No.  However, you would
723 march into battle, and destroy another intelligence without a second
724 thought, even though that single intelligence is more valuable than all
725 the diamonds and gold in the solar system.  You work hard to earn money,
726 but do not work hard to preserve this quality which, from all the
727 evidence we have to date, is a unique event in the universe.  Gold and
728 diamonds can be found scattered all across the void.  But there is no
729 evidence, other than unproven theories, that intelligence exists
730 anywhere else.
731  
732 We have armies to protect ourselves.  Why do we want to protect
733 ourselves? To stay alive.  To keep our society alive.  Why then do we
734 not invest heavily into expanding our species off this planet so that we
735 can collectively live even longer? Close to 200 million years ago, the
736 impact of an asteriod theoretically terminated entire species.  Why
737 should we feel we are more immune to an inhospitable universe which is
738 lobbing rocks in our direction than to spears from a neighboring tribe?
739 The greatest irony of this era may be when we, with our state-of-the-art
740 spears pointed at another, suddenly look up and realize that in our
741 incredible stupidity we've been preparing for the wrong disaster.  That
742 will probably be the last time our species looks up at the heavens.
743  
744 Sorry, didn't mean to get so dismal.  Lately I seem to be getting off on
745 tangents like that quite a bit.  Maybe the boss ws right.  Maybe I
746 should see a shrink.  How can someone be so bothered by something as
747 obscure as the survival of a species?
748  
749 As usual, I let this letter go on a bit too long.  My apologies.
750 I just want to tell you that I value your friendship above all else. 
751 Thank you....Ben    (...to be continued)

771 Dear Ben:
772 It was very kind of you to send such a letter.  I appreciate your
773 thoughtfulness. 
774  
775 My father told me you have doctorate in mathematics, but will not let
776 anybody call you Dr. Jamen.  The Japanese believe the man who drop his
777 title for better purpose is most honorable.  I believe you are very
778 honorable.  
779  
780 I pick my name from baby book.  The next time we meet, we can look at
781 the book and pick another name.  I do not know good name or bad name and
782 know we can pick a good name.
783  
784 The equations you desire are the propety of my father.  You must discuss
785 with him.  But, please remember, it is not good to have too much desire,
786 whether this desire is for yourself or for mankind.  You will not
787 accomplish your purpose if you have too much desire.

880 big budget major-release 3-D movie in   years (Friday the YThirteenth 3 and

886      *Are you sure you're going to be   all right, Michael?* Mukluk rose as he
887 spoke, shaking the pink shale dust from his shaggy frame and pawing at his
888 tired brown eyes.
889      "I'll be fine...  I just need some time by myself..." He gestured to the
890 hill nearby.  "Why not join the others  in base camp and let me-"
891      *Others?  Just Standor...*
892      Michael paused for a moment,       regarding the husky quizically.  
893 "Oh..." he finally said. "Of course.    Join him and I'lll be with you before
894 you know it."
895      Looking back a few times, the      great beast crossed over the peak of
896 the hill, vanishing from sight.
897      
898      Reaching into his pack, Michael    quicly withdrew several objects... a
899 stone candlestick, a thin-bladed knife, and a waxy bar of green material.
900 Oblivious to the blistering heat of the twin suns, Michael continued his work,
901 cutting a thin strip from the bar,      pressing it firmly into place in the   
902 candlestick, and working the stone bottom into the loose dirt and rose-colored 
903 dust just in front of him.  
904      That done, he quickly retrieved    the temporarily discardedd blade and
905 used the incredibly sharp edge to carve a circle around himself in the ground,
906 making sure it was deep enough that the low wind wouldn't fill any parts of it 
907 in the moments that were to come.  He   wasn't sure how his efforts would be   
908 received in the confines of the Stone    Triangle's miniature world, but he    
909 hoped that they would be sufficient to  overcome the energy barrier, if such   
910 efforts proved necessary.
911      Lighting a small Bic-Tech, he      used the fine laser point to 
912 instantly ignite the stick, which began releasing thick clouds of blue smoke 
913 into the air before Michael's eyes.     Tired from his long journey, from the  
914 struggles of his daily existence, it was no difficuly for the Enforcer to allow
915 himself to drift away in the clouds of  incense...  To allow his spirit free   
916 reign, becoming oblivious to the burning heat on his back, the wind, slipping  
917 away...

949      Michael was momentarily distracted by the soft purring in the background.
950 "What's that?"
951      The disembodied voice became       joyful.  ^Ooh!  Those are whale songs.
952 Aren't they just to de for?^
953      "Quite."
954      ^But I'm not being at all          the attentive host.  You're going to
955 require something more substantial for  your stay...^  The wavering mistscape
956 shuddered and reconceptualized into a   waiting room done in muted pinks.
957      Very nice..."
958      ^Correct me if I'm wrong, but you  said something about obscurities...^
959      "Two of them, today.  They weren't substantial enough for me to pinpoint
960 the details...  the White Tower,        naturally from the past, since it      
961 doesn't exist anymore... and a little   jaunt to SINAT, probably in the        
962 future."
963      ^Oh, quite.  I took the crew there just yesterday^
964      "Was the Seeker having a party?"
965      ^Why YES!  Odd, that you should    Inhabit a moment so close to my 
966 present...  More likely than not a      sign of trouble ahead for you...^
967      "I'm here to ask your advice on a  matter of great importance..."
968      ^Oh damn it all.  Is it time for   that Quantier episode?^
969      The whale songs became more urgent and fleeting.
970      "Yes."
971      ^And you and Mukluk and Standor    are all trapped in the Stone Triangle.
972 Right?^
973      "Yes."
974      ^I've had more difficulties with   those Triangles!  I'm SURE that it's
975 a pleasing distraction for them, but    sometimes I just wish that the 
976 Anglers hadn't made them...  Either way, you know I can't give out advice
977 on a matter involving a currently       existing temporal paradox.  It just    
978 isn't done...^
979      "I know, but..."  
980      The voice became petty and harsh,  and the whale songs grated against
981 the sky.  ^You know the penalties...    I believe I must take my leave of you, 
982 Michael.  Goodbye.^
983      Michael's head fell forward into   his hands, which even now began to 
984 fade.  "Goodbye, Michael..."
