115    Yes, we may have met. I was at the Gresham roller rink a
116 little before Christmas. Let me give you a description of the
117 girl I met.
118    She was about 3 inches shorter than me, had braces, brownish-
119 blonde hair and was a freshman at the time.
120    She said that her parents or someone was a computer dealer
121 which informed me that it MIGHT be you. Just in a curious
122 state......

134 For sale:
135 
136 1979  Chevrolet  Crewcab  Pickup.   Started at $13,000  and  then 
137 $12,000 the next ad.  Now we are selling it for $10,500.
138 
139 Description:  One  ton.  Long wide bed.  Automatic  transmission. 
140 Powersteering.  Powerbrakes.  Cruise control.  Air  conditioning. 
141 Step hitch. Warn Hubs (4-wheel drive).  Warn 8000 lb. winch. Dual 
142 exhaust  for  the 454 cubic inch engine which is the  replacement 
143 engine for the original 360 cubic inch.  Aluminum mag wheels with 
144 all  new steel belt radials.   Extra set of steel rims and tires.  
145 Cobra  CB/FM/AM Cassette (regular cassette - not 8  track).  Tilt 
146 wheel.  Sliding rear window.  Tool box to fit across the long wed 
147 bed.  Extra  gas tank to fit on top of tool box.   Total  of  200 
148 gallons  to  feed  through regular dual gas tanks  with  electric 
149 change  over.   One compartment can be set up for  diesel.   Dual 
150 batteries  which recharge off the main alternator.   One  battery 
151 used for winch.   Fog lights.   Uses regular gas.   Passed DEQ in 
152 Portland last month.   Extra set of cloth seat covers.   Interior 
153 clean  and damage free.   Is not the "Dooley" wheels in order  to 
154 accomodate a camper.
155 
156 We  bought  this rig in order to travel across the country  in  a 
157 camper.   Just as we were about to buy the camper, we had a motor 
158 fire.   The insurance company paid for the repairs which amounted 
159 to about $10,000.   I put in another $1500 in work to make it all 
160 perfect  down to replacing the cam shaft in the  engine.   Cooper 
161 Auto  did most of the work at l06th and NE Halsey and he said  he 
162 will give itemized receipts.   The point of all this is that  the 
163 guts  of  the  engine compartment are new.   The  odometer  reads 
164 50,000 miles, but the odometer is the only thing that old.
165 
166 To  replace  this rig with all the special equipment  would  have 
167 cost the insurance company $23,000,  so they could not have  felt 
168 too bad to get it done for "only" $10,000.  For someone who needs 
169 this  kind of rig with all the recent work done on it,  it should 
170 be a good deal.  
171 
172 We own it free and clear.

188 age.  Is that close enough for you?...
189 To:  Tron     From:  Lori      Re:  ?
190 Sorry to disappoint you but I DO NOT and never have had braces.  I 
191 just graduated from high school and am 5 feet 1 inch tall.  My hair
192 falls to just about the middle of my back and is of a dark brown 
193 color.  Does that sound familiar to you??  My family is not into
194 computers.  In fact, the terminal that I am now working on is my
195 sister's.  Well, it is on loan to her.  I originate from West

211 It would seem that the "Dragon Lady" would turn all the Local
212 BBS' into taverns such as this one. The use of pseudonyms helps to
213 set the atmosphere of the establishment. One would expect much different
214 people and conversations at other places within the (electronic) comm-
215 unity. CBBS is more of a country store or community center
216 than Backwater. There is room and nessesity for both. The picture
217 one would get of the Dragon lady is of an empty-headed party girl
218 unable to deal with any other situation and thus insistent on
219 transporting her desires to other establishments.

221 lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
222 Dear Mr. Grody;
223    I do believe you have hit the nail on the head...
224                               Best Wishes
225                                    the Phantom Glitch
226 YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
227 To: Bit Byter:
228    How old are you? You sound over the hill. The newer computers
229 are not junk. They are usually better at what they are. They could 
230 be better, but you couldn't afford them (see more on this below.)
231 We all live in our own dream world, which is OK as long as you know
232 it, but your comment implies you don't. Ah,well.
233 ........................
234 Electronics, jun 30,1983; page 50
235 
236 Breaking it's long silence on the successor to it's Cyber 205 supercomputer,
237 CDC has revealed plans for an 8 processor machine called the 2XX. It's made
238 of CMOS logic arrays cooled with liquid nitrogen to acheave speeds of up to
239 40 times faster than the Cyber 205 (which is about tied with the Cray as
240 the fastest computer made). It should peak at over 10 gigaflops, with
241 sustained rates of 1 to 2 gigs. (wowee!!) Each of the 8 processors will
242 have up to 32 megabytes, and up to 2 megs of shared memory.
243 If that is out of your price range (no, they weren't willing to burn the
244 mag up with the price) you can still get a TI 99-4a for $100, but perhaps
245 not for long, as they are losing money on them pretty fast, and are likely
246 to do what they did with digital watches:buy the market but not be able
247 to afford to stay in the market once they did. Or, in other words, I
248 think the 99-4 is a dead end. Buy now while it still exists.
249 
250 In any case, the quality of the machines is very good, but what counts
251 is the software. (As walt Bilofsky say "with out software, it's just 
252 an expensive paperweight.") Sorry to say, this means CP/M. Even a perfect
253 machine would die in the market without software.
254 
255 Compare your dream computer with what BWMS runs on, and see what even a 
256 real dog can do. I like my VIC-20; it's not a big, powerful machine, but
257 for $82.99, you can't beat it. If you don't like it, pay your $50 million
258 and get a 2XX.

289     Slinging mud again, are you, Grody?  I will not stoop to such depths
290 myself, although I have more than enough cause to!  Curious that you come
291 stabbing when you figure that my back is turned, just as you did when I was
292 taking my leave last winter...On, to indignantly rebut your appraisal of
293 this female's intelligence and adaptability!  First, your point regarding
294 the variety of atmospheres that can be found--and the necessity for this--
295 displayed a measure of imagination and tolerance.  In fact, your comparing
296 CBBS to a community center was quite the apt illustration (I see not the
297 rustic flavour of a country store, though) and is persuasive logic
298 towards adapting to its crisp style.  But why, Max Grody, must you mar
299 your musings with negative suppositions and judgments against a fellow
300 billboard-peruser?  The basic assumption that you must have started with
301 was plausible, perhaps:  that of seeing a female 'insist' on creating
302 anarchy in order to make herself comfortable.  From this-->groan<...
303 now I'M assuming!--you evidently decided it was because she was not
304 CAPABLE of handling other environments, and therefore slabbed on some
305 extra labels, i.e. "party girl" and scatterbrained.  Now, to dissect
306 and refute!  To begin with, your basic premise was wrong.  When I came
307 wandering into CBBS, I had no clue that I would cause a major uproar over
308 pen names; as my first comment reflects, I was rather pleased with the
309 system as it stood, and found their 	rule on nicknames reasonable and
310 seemingly flexible.  (The wording of it does not specifically ban their
311 use, only restricts it.)  Then they started this 'vote on nicknames' bit,
312 and I soon discovered that I was swimming against the tide on an issue
313 that I didn't really raise!  (No doubt Samuel Langhorne Clemens would be
314 cheering me on, if he had not been so boorish as to die in 1910!)  It
315 became simply a matter of principle to muster as much ingenuity as could
316 be found to defend the cause, even though the outcome was not of Great
317 Significance to me.  As for another implication in your unfriendly blurb
318 regarding how this female 'can't handle the situation', which seems to be
319 a slur on my ability to converse on the business-like level of CBBS:  I
320 reveal precisely what I wish to about myself, and why should I have to
321 prove my versatility to YOU?  Because a person does not change faces when
322 commanded to does not mean they are incapable of it!  Your comments that
323 accuse me of being the 'party-type' and 'giddy' I have to laugh at!  Such
324 labels are quite ridiculus; if you only knew the reality--!  By the way,
325 if your slander continues in this vein, I will not bother to answer; and
326 you need not think you're eroding my self-image, either.  My reputation
327 is built with my own hands, and will not easily be torn to bits, if that
328 is what you're after, Grody my man...(and what is YOUR name?)

339 can find it again and have the time to do so. I'm sure you will
340 find it amusing. In fact it might just be suitible to the current

342 ***** CISTOP MIKEY AGAIN *** 8 JULY 83 ***** 8:35AM **************
343 Lady of Dragons: Whoof! My, I am totaly blown away with the last
344 little speech. I must applaud you for your excellent response
345 to Mr. Groady. I was wondering who was on here at 12:30AM last
346 night when I got home. (I should have known, but I was too beat
347 to even turn on the terminal and see who was there.) I do wonder 
348 though if Mr. Groady and the like have ever REALLY read anything
349 you have said. It seems they have simply taken an idea and blown
350 it all out of proportion because of some prejudice they have
351 which they find threatened by this idea of nicknames. It does 
352 seem strange since they didn't have this prejudice when DOC WATSON
353 was on the system. As for CBBS being more of a community center
354 then BWMS, I really do wonder how much they have paid any attention
355 to these systems and the goings on thereof. Finally to have the
356 gaul to speek of you as an empty-headed female! My! I now know
357 for a fact that they can't read! As it is quite obvious to any who
358 would even glance at you writings that this is not even close.
359 Your last little speech proves it yet once again.
360 ***** CISTOP MIKEY YET AGAIN **** 8 JULY 83 ***** 8:45AM *********
361 Lori: Hello yet once again. It is refreshing to see another lady
362 on the system. Particularly after listening to the Mr. Groady
363 person. With comments of that sort it is no wonder there are
364 so few women here! It would take a very strong woman to stand up
365 to that kind of asault! Hmmm, do you think maybe we've touched on
366 the real reason for this attack? Maybe that is exactly what they
367 are after (I.E. Removing women from these worlds.) Considering
368 it to be an exclusive 'mens' club of some sort. If this is the
369 case, I feel very sorry for them. But I must leave now, I've
370 got to get to work. I'm already late>>>>

378 i've been following the debate on this
379 system and cbbs regarding aliases with  some interest.
380 i would not presume to defend dragon lady (she's shown she can do that
381 very well herself).  but i thought i    would throw my two cents in
382 anyway.  first i would like to point out that the 'party' personality
383 is not restricted to the female gender. men can be just as big empty
384 headed twits as women. second, it seems that a party person would
385 not even bother with this type of systemthere's all those parties to
386 go to, right?  as for the fantasy world aspect of aliases---personally
387 i deal with the darker side of reality  every day in my avocation and
388 this is a convienient escape...more     feasibile than the other vices
389 available.  this bbs is the most creative in the portland area
390 i see this and other systems as an art  form in infancy
391 so come on maxie boy, back off a little and enjoy it for what it is...
392 if the dragon lady and others of her ilk offend you so much, try another
393 system.

413 my message was intended as a reply to 
414 the person who commented as to the probable intentions of a specific subset of
415 the users;it was with the intent of showing the irrationality of such a line 
416 of thought.My apologies to you.
417   I myself lept in surprise after perusing your note,who said anything about 
418 immoral?I find mock indignation almost as annoying as max's diatribe;both are
419  to the same end,max comments on what he believes to be the mental condition 
420 of a specific woman,and apparently women in general,reactions such as yours only
421 encourage such skewed thinking,by supporting that females are somehow "more
422 airheaded",more "sensative",or differnt in some nebulus way.
423    I find the contents of back-water a
424 mental breath of fresh air,especially when there is input from the more capable
425 gender(female),as some of us men get caught in the rut of believing that all
426 is cut-and-dry,that we have to stand on protocol to relate to fellow humans,and
427 that those who are following there own path such as our D.L. ,are somehow less,s
428 somehow different from us.
429    Don't fall in,Lori.
430    My apologies again to you,and 
431          welcome.

485 Ah! But my words got a response and from the tone of the response(s),
486 it would seem that I have touched a nerve.  First, read my last message ag
487 again, as I never used the words "giddy" or "scatterbrained".
488 Dark prince, I specifically said that establishments such as
489 Backwater were nessesary - my point is that it would be bad
490 to turn all the other BBS's in the area into Backwater Inns.
491 The Atmosphere of CBBS is very much akin to an old Country store,
492 with a few people on the corner playing board games, and salesmen
493 or farmers hawking their wares, etc. -- the only part missing
494 is the propriator selling his wares.
495 As for masks, we all wear masks - but the mask should be appropriate
496 to the occasion.
497 You disapprove of my tone, yet you not only respond but now have
498 some emotional investment. As for my "dislike" of women-
499 it doesn't exist - what I am echoing is womens dislike of themselves!!!

511 What an interesting and absured thing to say! "What I am echoing is
512 womens dislike of themselves!" I find this most unusual comeing
513 from a male (or one who professes to be) My reaction is 'how would
514 you know? Are you a woman that you can know what they think and
515 feel for that matter what of the many varied number of women out 
516 there? Yes there might be some who dislike themselves for some reason
517 or another, but I hardly find this to be special or out of the ordinary
518 there are just as many males who have the same feelings. But on the
519 whole I cannot beleive that all those women out there hate themselves!
520 That is a totaly absured thought!. I really wonder what rock you have
521 been hiding under? Surely you are capable of coming up with a more
522 intelligent accusation then that, or at least you should be able to.
523 You speek of the bubbleheadedness of some who use this system, but
524 I really wonder who is the bubblehead after seeing that comment.

542    It would seem that Senor Grody suffers from an affliction common to computer
543 enthusiasts.  (I am not speaking of myopia.)  People (male or otherwise) who
544 enjoy spending hours with a computer often feel less than comfortable around
545 other humans.  A machine is predictable (even when suffering from intermittent
546 anomalies).  A machine doesn't laugh at you.  A machine won't hurt your feelings
547 because you can always turn it off (and it knows it!).
548    The machine lover finds it difficult to interact with people who don't 
549 share the same love of machines, especially members of the opposite sex.  They
550 resort to clumsy attempts to gain the attention of possible "objects of
551 affection" (if you will please pardon the expression).  Often as not, these
552 attempts backfire and produce the opposite effect desired.
553    And what delightful fantasies you can have with a crt when a desirable
554 creature leaves messages on Mikey's disks!  Drawers?  Not unless they are
555 the drawers that contain the archives of BWMS.
556    It is always nice to dream, eh Maximillian?

579 Consider the title of CISTOP and the meaning thereof;
580 This is a strange title you might say, for few have seen its like
581 before. What is its meaning and why was it chosen? At first it
582 would seem but a humourous misspelling of a commonly used 
583 abbreviation for systems operator. Closer examination will show
584 that it goes much deeper then this. If you look in your dictionary
585 (Ahhh do I hear the rusling of pages?) you will find an interesting
586 deffinition accorded the word. (I would in hope that you are looking
587 at an unabridged dictionary.) The definition being that of a tomb or
588 chest. Yet if we look further, we find that it comes from a Greek
589 word 'CISTA'. If we look yet even further, we find that this was
590 also used for the base of the word 'CISTERN', which may be defined as 
591 a reservoir of water. Does the meaning now become clearer?.......
592 Of course, it is quite possible that some will mistake it as simply
593 a misspelling of 'CYST', a saclike structure filled with diseased
594 matter, Which a few would consider BWMS to be on the backside of
595 the message system community. No matter, you may choose the 
596 definition you wish....
