25   Gradually the pegasus folded her wings, continuing her canter over the 
26 soft grey pavement that had solidified beneath her hooves.  The piper 
27 finished his song, then began another.  Somehow even the soft rocking mothin
28 of the pegasus' canter lulled the piper into a strange mental state.  Trees
29 seemed to bow and dance along the sides of the highway, prancin a stately
30 minuet, weaving their way between the underbrush, bushes and shrubs running
31 like children beneath their elder's feet.
32    The road they followed rolled gently up, then down, alternately revealing
33 and concealing small hollows, in which the piper imagined that he could see
34 ghostly dwellings.  Breasting one especially large hill, the piper looked 
35 down into a larger than usual hollow.  The soft road that he was following
36 let down the hill and along the main street of a small village.

46 TO: All Local Skydiving Enthusiasts
47      If you are one of the hundreds of skydivers who bought
48 easy skydiving parachute (model EC-25A) from Bournemouth
49 Broilly Mailorder House; please correct page 7 line 8 of
50 the instruction booklet (Publication 625, 1985);  the
51 words "state zip code" should read "pull rip cord."  I
52 followed the instruction to the letter, resulting to a
53 very rough landing.  I started reciting "97214 -97214 -
54 97214" at 600 ft, but the chute didn't open.  I kept on
55 yelling mu zip code till I hit the bough of a fir tree.
56                      I learned it the hard way.

59 The wraith like phantasm floated lightly in the dimly lit void.  He 
60 waited patiently, it had been a long hard struggle for him to locate
61 the position he is in now.  He is waiting for an occurrence that happens
62 only once in any given life time.
63      For a seemingly endless period of time he had hypothesized about
64 this occurrence.  No one had
65 believed him, they had all thought of him as strange.  Now it was 
66 coming true.  They would see, they would suffer, they would pay for
67 their blindness and doubt.  Never again would another doubt him.

78 Gee, I'mm seeing two of everything.  It's probably due to having set up my
79 terminal to go into chat with another terminal.  Odd to have picked up the 
80 phone to hear a carrier signal.  After I realized what was going on, I
81 changed the b.p.s. to 300 from 1200 and reset a few of the variables.
82 On the fifth call, success!  I was then informed to keep the bells down to
83 an extreme minimum- he was in class, silent typing. This is hard on the 
84 eyes. I guess I'll quit for now.  Nothing much new here since the last 
85 call...     Farseer? How interesting...

150 Val:  So you made it to the top, huh?  Well, it's where you belong.
151 Thanks for the kindness and the compliment the other day.  My story continues
152 as follows:
153 
154   He was now in the shadows of the inner courtyard.  Silently he made his way 
155 along the base of the wall, muscles ready to spring into action instantly 
156 should the need arise.  Carefully he proceeded step by step, feeling along
157 the wall about six inches ahead of him with his hands.  Somewhere, there should
158 be a...ah, there it was.  A small cord, invisible in the darkness, ran from
159 the wall in a straight line towards the palace.  Pausing once more to allow
160 a group of samurai pass over him on the wall, he began to follow the cord, 
161 careful not to disturb it  lest the guards be alerted of his presence.  The
162 cord was a new addition to palace defenses; effective - yet here it defeated
163 its own purpose.  He was nearing the end of the rope - he could tell by the
164 decrease in the sag of the rope.  Yes, here were several wooden blocks hanging
165 close together.  Any movement of the rope would cause the blocks to colide,
166 alerting the guards.  And there, to the left, was the watchman, looking straight
167 through him in the shadows of the night.  Carefully, so as not to make a sound,
168 he eased his way to the side and circled around back of the guard.  Slowly,
169 he eased forward and gingerly set his dagger at the base of the man's throat,
170 careful not to betray his presence by any sound of movement.  Then, in one
171 quick flash of movement he drew his dagger across the man's throat.  The man
172 dropped silently to the ground, blood pooling on the ground where he lay.  
173 Quickly and quietly he drug the body into the darkest shadows, and carefully
174 covered the trail of blood and disturbed earth with dust.  Searching the scene
175 one more time for anything he might have missed, he quickly produced from 
176 his pack four small claw-like items, made of steel - Ashikos and shukos, made
177 for the specific purpose of scaling walls.  He slipped the ashikos over his
178 boots, making sure they were secure and would not  come off.  Then he quickly
179 slid the shukos over his hands, turned to the wall, and began to study the 
180 wall for difficulty of ascent.  In the darkness, he could barely make out the
181 faint outline of a window, far above him and a little to the right.       
182 Positioning himself directly beneath his goal, he began his ascent.  One small
183 misjudgement of balance, and he would fall to the ground below.  Carefully
184 he made his way up the side of the building:  left foot, left hand, right 
185 foot, right hand...until he at last arrived at the top.  Listening from the 
186 outside, he quickly determined there was no one in whatever room or passageway
187 lay beyond.  Quietly, as he had been taught to do since childhood, he pulled
188 himself through the window and into the true darkness beyond.

197    Rodgar was tired.  Almost four days had passed since he had last seen
198 ny sign of civilization at all.  The shapes of houses and sidewalks,
199 familiar to you and me, faded from his memory.  All he remembered was the
200 ss of the snake, the chattering of the birds, and the trickle of water
201 flowing swiftly nearby.
202      Looking up, Rodgar saw that the sun would be at its fullest in a few
203 more minutes.  He leaned against a tree to rest, and opened his canteen to
204 drink.  So much was he one with the other creatures here that a rodent
205 passed silently by him, hardly noticing his tall frame blocking the sun.
206      A glint of light, a reflection of the sun made by some shiny material,
207 ught Rodgar's attention.  A mirror?
208      Intrigued, Rodgar crept closer to the shiny object.  Peering through
209 the dense brush, he finally was able to see the rest of the object.
210      In a small clearing was a fountain, about 2 meters high.  A
211 lear liquid gushed forth from various openings, falling in an intricate
212 nce to the pool below.  Faint markings could be seen upon a plaque.
213      Rodgar stepped through the brush as if enchanted by the strange
214 untain.  Almost as if he were dreaming, he kneeled down and drank
215 deeply of the water at the bottom.
216     If anyone had been around to watch, they might have glimpsed Rodgar
217 gin to glow, shine brightly, then vanish altogether.  Only an old
218 nteen marked the place where the young explorer had been.
219      Rodgar himself beheld an interesting sight.  His mind filled
220 ith disbelief as he found himself shedding light, nearing the
221 luminesence of the sun itself.  His mind, unable to go into shock any
222 urther, was unaffected by the larger of the two surprises- he found, after
223 he had stopped glowing, that he was no longer in the world he had known.
224  large building with a stable lay nearby, the rowan tree before them
225 isplayed the early buds of spring.  Looking frantically about, then rubbing
226 his eyes four or five times, Rodgar tried to change the scene.  Nothing
227 orked.  Recovering from shock, he made
228  decision.  He got up, brushed himself lightly, then made his way to the doors
229 what seemed to be an Inn.

261 Here was a writer with excitement in his blood, thought THOR of the author
262 called RONIN. Yet, he tells of death and of killing that fill the spaces but
263 not reality. For THOR knew too well the ways of death. Especially the methods of quiet assassins. To feel the 
264 victims presence before striking, to smell your victim and to reach out and take him by the throat.
265 It was then that you felt the victims heart stir into high gear and the blood in his veins would race passed your
266 fingertipss. You could feel the gland in his neck, yes it would be there. You
267 could not see it for it would be dark yet even so your fingers could feel
268 the throbbing dove eggs which were your guide to your victims death.
269 The knife must cut below this gland and thrust downward towards the victims
270 sternum. The razor sharp dirk would enter quickly and slash through the victims carotid artery. It would then
271 travel downward across the victims windpipe, under his voice box so that the fight for life would be a silent
272 and losing battle. The only sound that would be heard would be the release of air from the windpipe as the lungs 
273 emptied themselves in a vain attempt to scream. But THOR knew there would be no shrill, no cry, no noise, as the 
274 victim no longer would have a voice to cryout with. THOR thought to himself how some had spoke of this kind of 
275 killings as being an art. Only a mad man or one whose morbid sense of talent and tastes were detached from 
276 e method of murder an art form then they must feel like an atomic explosion was some kind of great light-show.
277 THOR hoped that this kind of art would become a lost art for all of mankind.

287   The piper gazed a long moment down the road through the village.  The pegasus,
288 impatient at the delay, danced on the soft gray pavement.  Down the soft winding
289 road the piper heard whispers and tags of conversation, issuing from what seemed
290 to be some kind of central structure.
291   Urging the pegasus onward, they wound down the hill toward the waiting village
292 below.  The brilliance of the moon cast the edges of the road into sharp relief,
293 and cast impenetrable pools of gloom at the base of stately trees edging the
294 road.  The sound of the pegasus' hooves was not the crisp clicking "chunk"
295 we associate with a horse's hooves on pavement, rather it was a softly muffled
296 sound like that of the tired head of a three-year old child striking a pillow.

335 	There was to be a time when two men would meet. They would not know
336 what the other looked like, but vague descriptions were all they had to go on
337 in order that they would someday meet. Both men had spoken on the land line for
338 only the shortest of time, and then it was only through a mediator, the only  
339 one that knew what these two actually looked like.
340 	"I've heard of you, you know. Your reputaion precedes you." It was
341 the darker of the two that spoke first. Darker to some, pale to others.
342 	"It has? I'm not at all surprised." The other felt that it was point-
343 less to return the comment of having been heard of. He had learned to mind his
344 tounge while in conversation with ones not know to him.
345 	"If you are to meet, you must decide on the place. It is up to you."
346 The words came from the one that had arranged it all and had connected to two.
347 Long drawn out moments passed before either one spoke, each expecting the other
348 to take the initiative. Then the short silence was broken.
349 	"How does the city center sound to you?" It was again the darker one.
350 	"That's too easy. Yes."
351 	"Where then? Would the Francis and Martin Offices be OK?"
352 	"Yes that would be OK." Constantly did this one watch his own words.
353 	"Fine then. I've named the place, now you name the pin-point. Where?"
354 	"Again, too simple. How about the Data Processing Department, do you
355 know where that is?"
356 	"Yes," said the dark one. "I can do that. Let's make it for ten
357 thirty in the morning, or is that too soon?"
358 	"Make it eleven-thirty, and I'll see you tomorrow."
359 	The two then made clear a few more important points, such as what it
360 would be that they would exchange once having met.  It would be paper. It was
361 not to be common paper for these papers held secrets to the safety of their
362 nation, papers that would be traded to be used by others that had made this
363 confrontation a mandate.
364 	For some reason the two never met on that day, the day they
365 planned for with not enough detail. But noone would pay, time was not critical.
366 Not yet.

371     Thor: I understand your hope, I as well hope it. I say that only so you
372 will not confuse me in my following words.
373     I do not understand how you could call say it had little to do with real-
374 ity. One level, perhaps. For the samurai warrior dwels in quite different
375 reality. It is not quite "human". But, could hardly be called "animal" either.
376 Stripped of there emotions, it is an art. Yes, a deadly one. One that brings
377 a sensation of disgust to our thoughts. But, the art is reality. For the
378 samurai, as well as the ronin, deal with a very different reality than I do.
379 They are murderers. They deal with death. I would say that is pretty real.
380 My thoughts are stumped, when I think of what (on both a social and personal
381 level) one's past would have to involve in order to turn it to such a course.
382 But, then, it is our species' history. Ah, often horrid. But, I think it 
383 would follow a more individual level to make one turn to such a thing. It is
384 that way for the samurai, I think, as well as for the ronin.

388 He was after all, once a samurai. And, yet, we do not know why he is no 
389 longer. I wish to find out.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
390 To the above: Sir, I fear that you are somewhat confused. A Ronin was merely
391 a masterless samurai. They often took to banditry. The person in the story 
392 is obviously a NINJA. A quite different type of person. Samurai are best known as
393 warriors. Ninja are spies & assassins.

421 Thor:  Your wish for such methods of killing to be forgotten is noble, but is, 
422 as you said of the method, not likely to happen in reality.  It would, however,
423 be a better world if all thought like you and Tanya.
424 
425 Student:  Yes, as a matter of fact, I have read The Sunset Warrior Trilogy lately.
426 Even within the last year.  I enjoyed them thoroughly.
427 
428 Leonard:  You are absolutely correct on all accounts.  Ronin is simply a word of
429 the Japanese language meaning 'masterless warrior'.  Whether or not he was at one
430 time  or another a samurai is an independant matter.
431 As for the person in the story, I tend to agree that he must be a Ninja.  He 
432 certainly does not fit the traditional description of a samurai or ronin.
433 Perhaps time will tell.

482    Petrov gazed out the window.  The gentle scent of fresh cut grass heralded
483 the coming of Spring.  The sunshine taunted Petrov, who had been in hiding since
484 fleeing from Joshua and L'homme.  The longing to enjoy the warm weather reminded
485 him of the feeling he got when studying for finalls during Springtime.
486    Only one thing could make Petrov happy, but alas, you don't see too many 
487 flocks of wild sheep around any more.

498 RONIN:Please do not be offended, I was very much pleased with your story line.
499 I was just tired and rambling over old and thought forgotten memories. I am 
500 not usually a critizer of anyones writing and I apologize if I offended. The 
501 method that you described of killing with a knife was not in line with the
502 direct teachings of assassins. I was only describing (too descriptively) the
503 method used by not only warriors but also soldiers. If one cuts the throat of
504 a victim for instance, from ear to ear, you run the chance of having him 
505 living long enough to either kill you or warn his comrades. If it is an instant
506 death you are looking for then the blade must be placed into the base of 
507 the skull where the brain stem resides and controls the functions of the motor
508 and reflex systems of the body. Enough said and again I am sorry if you thought
509 I was being critical, please write more as you have the talent to do so.

514 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (the sighting)
515      As we made our way through the field of knee high grass that seperated one
516 clump of trees from the next, our new companion and guide motioned us to stay
517 still.  For silence to be maintained in an upright position while moving in 
518 this sun dried field was a science in itself, something I had never needed,
519 something he had mastered.  While we were forced to slow in our advance we were
520 also afforded greater time in which to seek any foreigners in the approaching
521 strands that were to be called trees.
522      Five!  There were five figures to be seen in woods before us.  Although 
523 scarcely joined, they appeared almost to be of the same party.  It was not 
524 easy to tell the individuals from the pairs.  Before I was able to halt our
525 guide, he had already drawn his bow and was in the process of knocking one of
526 his practice arrows.  Practice?  This was odd, if he were to draw his bow with
527 such haste, would it not have been for something of grave importance?
528      "It is to be a sign.  A gesture to warn the outlanders that they have come
529 to the boundaries of our village."  She was calm in saying so, but I felt that
530 there was more to it than just that.  Was she holding out on me? I thought not.
531 Before I could even utter the words to say 'nay', the first arrow had been sent
532 on its route to meet with the leader of the group.  The whistling of the fletch
533 was thunder in my ears.  The time was now and the warning could not be revoked.

539   not aquire the same end?  (Unless the one released was to be The target?)
540 ***kathyd***:  You have my heartiest applause in responce to your last scribing
541   of your bout with "Desire"!  You have made me both laugh and become most   
542   still with the recognition that you have realized Desire for what it is-
543   a thing that we must all face and deal with in our own way.  How fortunate
544   you were to have retained your escape!  I, for one, wish to see more.  I am

554   For lack of oxygen, I think I can just forget the from Prometheus and stuff
555 for this entry.  I lack a little too muc hoxygen right now.  Lost it during a
556 pair of long sessions in a Risk game.  And after twelve hours of that, I dare
557 anyone to have decent oxygen levels in their heads.
558   The games were a little similar, the advocate of all the other players won.
559 The pair of games was split between myself and the Man in Gray.  Who was not
560 playing during the second game.  So I did not actually beet him.
561 
562   Wow, are we in enter only?  I guess we are, oh well, so any talk of oxygen
563 is like, in there forever?  Gee, I should have thought, but there was this itsy
564 bitsy problem with oxygen.
565 
566   Toward the end of any Risk game, there is such a military escalation that it
567 just fits the exhausted players so well.  Their tired minds just kind of adapt
568 and all of a sudden they are making these jokes about death and dying.  Cute.
569   Then again, at the front of any Risk game, everyone is calm cool and trying
570 to look collected. It is all an elaborate hoax really, but a social nescessity
571 to psyche fellow players out.  Interesting to see them go between the two at
572 the end of one game and the start of the other.
