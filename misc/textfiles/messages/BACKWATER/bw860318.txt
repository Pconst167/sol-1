26 <> Aaron <> : We all remember that brash young man with the smooth talk and
27 the Federation uniform promising new heights in BBS technology. It was to be
28 up Real Soon Then, but Then never came, and it came to pass that the promise
29 land of statro-systems just was all a pipe dream, a sort of Robert Preston-
30 ish teaser that was the work of a devilishly clever but sometimes twisted
31 computer cavalier. Can you blame us for being suspicious? This new system
32 makes even the none-too-soon forgotten UNICOM look like a minced C64 BBS
33 written in BASIC. If and when the number is posted, and reports from REAL
34 users start rolling in, your fallen word might revive a little of its
35 lost luster. Until then though, temper your claims as any good used-car
36 salesman would, i.e., only lie if it helps you to close the sale. Frankly,

97 Suggestion on new bbs:  Say NOTHING until it actually is running, and available
98 to the public.  I have seen too many people brag about what a wonderful bbs
99 they have/will have.  Usually, nothing ever comes of it.  If it does, the
100 bbs is frequently no better that average. Besides, if it really is so great,
101 word will spread within days and you'll have all the users you will ever want.
102 It is hard to keep such a secret in modemland.

105    Sue: Thank you for the warm welcome, and us college boys do have better  
106 things to do with our time... which we try to ignore, so we can revel in
107 the flotsam and jetsam that inhabit crufty corners such as the Inn.  Such a
108 gentle, familiar joy; returning here, finding the cruft as I left it, and 
109 always someone who remembers... someone who says hello...
110    As for the SmorgasSystem, it is a larger PDP-11. As for being desginated
111 for any specific use, only one comes to mind, I sincerly hope that it will
112 be of value as a communications tool. I have wasted so much time, so much
113 energy, playing with software written by HS students for their C64 and 1541
114 disk, inlicted from the hours of 12pm to 6am [Mom and Dad aren't awake], 
115 that end up going down in a month or two that I want to see if a truly 
116 usefull, powerful system availiable for public use is really an answer to
117 the demand for quality and utility the BBS public clammers for. I hope so,
118 as it is already a modemer's jungle out there now, and will only get worse
119 as the kid co-sysops migrate to sysopdum of thier own little systems, and
120 instead of having 50 or a 100 systems to sift through, we have 500 or a
121 1000.
122    I see from the enteries at the bottom of DB, my border may not be a 
123 unique as it once was... At least no one can take MA 76 away from me! I will
124 hold my ground, so to anyone out there eyeing my <><><> with evil intent, at

128    Just a final quick note.
129    I know that my story has run long, way too long for most people's tastes,
130 and I do apologize for that. But once I realized this I was far too committed
131 to do anything but let it run its course. Rest assured that it is an experience
132 you shall not have to endure again as I am leaving. Permanently.
133    I had fun writing this story, and I prefer to think that a few of you had
134 fun reading it. It was a long and complicated story and I think the only real
135 mistake I made was in making it too long for the format. There probably wasn't
136 a single person with the exception of Mikey who had the time and opportunity to
137 call almost daily and read all 49 episodes. This no doubt led to a lot of
138 confusion and boredom. I shall have to keep this on mind and the next time such
139 an idea strikes me, I shall put it where it belongs. In the deep six.
140    But I do appreciate the support some of you have given me.
141    I'm going now, and I won't be back. Enjoy yourselves, and rest assured it
142 was never my idea to 'take over' the board. I was just trying to give you
143 people some enjoyment. I know I did give some, and that's a satisfaction that
144 all the obnoxious pinheads in the world can never take away.
145    Take care of yourselves.

157 ignore them and let them immolate themselves in their own excess of spleen.

165    Sue: When I wuz in kindergarten, I used to hate the preschoolers.

167 I abhorred the gradeschoolers.  As a college boy - guess who I hate?

170 ************************************************************************
171 Destroyer: I too would hate to see you leave completely. As is obvious
172 by my comments, I *have* read your stories. Else how could I offer 
173 critisism? I have read your enteries, and I feel they are good. I still
174 think you could use some work on improving your style (we all could,
175 especially me), but I don't thik you should just give up. You obviously
176 enjoy writing, so why abandon it? There is really only one person who
177 has taken it upon himself to conduct a defamation campain against you.
178 Don't take that as meaning that everyone doesn't like you. I'm sure he
179 would like to believe that, but it simply isn't true. You do have friends
180 out here in modem land, and people *do* read your entries. I hate to see
181 any writer give up and leave. The are few enough real writers as it is.
182 And it is even more painful to lose one because of a personal vendetta
183 that some individual has. To put it simply, I am not asking you to leave.
184 I'm just not that way. I don't want to see anyone leave. I even let people
185 like NDG use the system, because they too have there place (if I can just 
186 figure out where...). I offer you critisism, but only to help you improve
187 so that you can obtain a wider audience and maybe, just maybe you'll fid
188 a way to make a living at it. The most wonderful thing in the world is to
189 get paid for doing something you enjoy.

192 Whomever: Lines 164-169 are *NOT* from Aaron, or so I would gather from
193 certain clues within the message itself.  The difference between it and
194 the earlier message that *was* from Aaron is quite marked.  Some things
195 never seem to change.....
196 
     Aaron, you aren't the only one who can claim the MA 76, though I will
197 give you credit as being the first one I can remember to carry the banner.
198 I've used it since the day back in.... 1983?.... that I first saw you make
199 that recommendation.  It's the best margin in my opinion, getting the most
200 entry per line possible while never wrapping around to the next line, even
201 with NU Y.

202      Destroyer, one thing you should try to remember is that, just because
203 you were discouraged here by a jerk (yes, Guano, I am speaking about you),
204 you shouldn't just stop writing.  Writing is like any other learned skill,
205 you have to do it and do it and do it some more before you gain the ability
206 you're looking for.  I think your work shows a lot of ability and desire.
207 There are things that need improving, but there isn't a writer in the world
208 about whom that cannot be said.  Throughout life you are going to encounter
209 the "critics", people without a flicker of the creative spark that drives
210 one to write or draw or sculpt, and they will be nasty and abusive in an
211 attempt to stop you from doing what they cannot.  Take the few constructive
212 comments they make for what they are worth, and discard the rest.  If you
213 wish to change your style to fit the medium, do so.  BW is a special medium,
214 with different limitations than you are likely to encounter elsewhere.  If
215 you go over 50 lines in an entry, you are going to irritate someone (though
216 why I have yet to understand.... some people make a career out of becoming
217 irritated).  But whatever you decide to do, don't stop writing.  You didn't
218 stop walking as an infant the first 100 times you fell down; the ability to
219 get discouraged is a learned trait.  Don't take the lesson now!

257 Hello I'm new to the modem scene. I've only had my system for a short
258 time and am just learning where the boards are in the area. 
259   Can anyone tell me what this board is used for?????
260 LIMPID LIZARD..................

262 ============
263 From various comments above it appears that someone is faking "aw shucks"
264 messages to The Destroyer. Hmmmmmm.  I don't trust anyone who claims that
265 he'll never use this system again, since it is so difficult to prove who's
266 who.  My guess is that he'll soon make his appearance (if he hasn't already)
267 as yet another user.
268 ===========
269 Limpid Lizard, this board is used for whatever purpose you choose as long
270 as it is not destructive.  Read the opening lines to this disk and also 
271 the help file, you'll get the hang of it.
272 ___________________________________________________________________________
273 To "====": I doubt that the (as you put it) "aw shucks" msgs are faked.
274 Destroyer may not have been the best writer ever seen on this board but he 
275 was at least readable!
276 Aaron & other MA 76 people: Try MA 75 as MA 76 with NU Y can result in
277 extra lines on the screen (printing in column 80 causes the cursor to go to
278 the next line, then comes the LF/CR)

300 OK, you old Backwater debaters, I know you are out there somewhere. I just wanted to ask you a couple questions. First
301 off, have you heard of our Chief of Police Penny's latest idea to make Portland's streets safer? She wants all new hires
302 on the police force to be NON-SMOKERS only. As you all know, smoking greatly affects a person's ability to enforce the
303 law, besides, no one likes to ride to the local bastile in a smelly patrol-car. Now this rule is not in effect yet, due
304 in part to its questionable legality. Now I ask you, is this the sort of actions we like to see our police officials 
305 taking? Is this the stuff of enforcement? First we make them cut their facial hair, then we make them stop smoking, what
306 on earth is next?

310 attesting to the fact that they did indeed brush their teeth this morning.
311 Then they will be disarmed so as not to violate any animal's civil rights,
312 resulting in them chasing down the street yelling "pretty please stop."
313 And so it goes.

316     Leonard:  Back in the days I raised the MA 76 banner (with a little 
317 help!), I was using an average terminal. Like most terminals, a character in
318 the 80th column didn't phase it one way or another... it was the 81st char-
319 acter the inserted the CR/LF combo...  Now, being substatially poorer, [but
320 University of Portland would claim "Ah, but so much more well rounded..."]
321 I have had the misfortune of using sub-average grade terminals... and guess
322 what? Yes, it's that 80th character that gets it into the 'gosh, you need a
323 new line... here, let me add one for you..." mode. Had I been just a tad
324 poorer, MA 75 might be my battle-cry now. But, of course, if everyone used
325 MA 76, even those users with lower grade terminals could run without extra
326 lines, as they then could be set to "no wrap", with no ill effect. Such is
327 the stuff ANSI is made of...
328     Cheap Imitation Aaron's Border Person:  Your a college boy too?  But
329 wouldn't that imply you graduated from high school? Well, unlike the real me

331 animals?  Are you dangerous to phenylketonurics?  Have an aftertaste?
332 MA 76 kid:  Gerbils gobble, woggles wobble.  IPO is late next week, requests
333 for previews gladly honored. And we wont fall down.
334     Sue: Those who can, do. Those who can't, cruft. Don't forget other 
335 prominent MA 76 supporters, like BAD (except when he was MA 7, eh Mike?) and
336 the other brave souls who layed down their margins so that we might have 
337 freedom from superflous LF's.... Sob... Where have all the flowers gone?

376 I don't often take an opinion, but here I find that I have a very strong
377 one. As is stated above. NDG, your words are most aptly applied to yourself.
378 There is not the overwelming hatred for Destroyer that you imply. There
379 are indeed those who don't care about his entries. There are also those
380 who do like his entries. And there are those who don't care one way or the
381 other. I have noticed that those who have stated that they don't like it
382 spend 90% or more personally detracting him. While those that have offered
383 support have taken the time to clearly state their position with a minimal
384 amount of name calling. Name calling offers little other then to show your
385 own lack in being able to express yourself. I'm surprised you haven't
386 attacked someone else. Piper maybe? no, he's too safe, not controversial 
387 enough. You would rather pick someone who isn't as powerful to attack so
388 that you can gain the attention you want. Again I say that I think it is a
389 shame that you feel you must use your talents to defame and denigerate
390 others. All you gain is negative attention. Why not pursue positive 
391 attention and be creative? Be constructive, not destructive. You'll get a
392 lot further inthe world by applying positive actions instead of negative.

413 	As I understand it, the reason for going for non-smoking cops is that
414 the health benefits and insurance for a non-smoker cost the department less
415 money. A compromise that would solve the money problem and not offend
416 smokers (gee, we don't want to do *that*) would be to have smokers pay the
417 difference in premiums themselves. But then we'd have to figure out a way
418 of insuring that they weren't lying. And (no doubt) it would be violate the
419 union contract....

519 my good god, you people ought to step back and take a good, long look at your
520 selves. I have been away for some time, traveling new lands and sighing at new s
521 sunsets. I come home to find this nice bbs decended to petty, picayune namecalli
522 ng and downright viciousness. Everybody wonders why we have a problem with worl
523 d peace..you people cannot even get along in the confines of a small northwest 
524 billboard system. I do not know the destroyer, or his writings, so I will not
525 pass judgement. All I ask is human kindness and perhaps a touch of sensitivity.
526 p.s... to those who believe that the destroyer will not be back... If you
527 delivered a marvelously vebose swan song worthy of ethel barrymore, wouldn't 
528 you come back at least t? 'Nuff Said.    Note: according to the Holy book of the
529 Pariana Riva, children of one human parent and one divine parent are called    
530 " Riders of The Perpetual Wind". It is said that their life is one step below
531 Hell. One half is morbidly aware of their mortality, and of the passage of 
532 time, and their other half strives to attqain Dematri Sumta (Divine peace).
533 This quest proves mentally unbending for the mortal half much of the time, and 
534 this accounts for the high level of insanity amoung this race. One cannot be a
535 God if they are not of the pure blood. It is sad.  Wouldnt you like to help 
536 these poor wretches? Send 9.95 today to tibet, the home of many of these.
537 Well, enough of this trivial pap. You   will perhaps see writings of mine soon.
538 Or perhaps I will vanish into the blue  wind of spring whence I came, eye
539 agliter with the sparkle of forbidden   knowledge. Or maybe I'll just saunter 
540 down to metro on brodway and get a cappuchino. WHOO KNOWS  what the woman of th

560 dear modemites,
561 did you know that the telephone company wants to charge you for local calls 
562 just like long distance?  You know per the minute per the mile, and even 
563 what time of the day it is?  This is called Local Measured Service (lms),
564 and it threatens to doom all bbs because it would make it to expensive to 
565 call. I work for an organization that is fighting them on this and we are 
566 doing an initiative campaign to stop it before it happens here. its happened
567 in eight other states and a residential phone bill has gone up 2-3 times what
568 they were.  CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THAT WOULD DO TO US?  If anyone out there 
569 would like to sign the petition or even circulate it please call Scott Williams
570 at 222-xxxx .

574 Smoking policemen... now there is a novel concept. Maybe what the chief is
575 afraid of is that while on a bust the policeman will rush up to the offender,
576 pull his gun, yell "Freeze, police!" take a deep drag off of his handy cig,
577 being short of breath as a result of the overexertion causes him to inhale
578 more deeply then normal, causing him to go into a fit of coughing, which
579 causes him to accidently shoot the suspect, then becuase he is doubled over
580 from the deep wracking cough, he accidentally fires the gun again, and
581 shoots himself in the foot. Yes, lets not allow any smoking of the police
582 officers, it's too dangerous. 
583 Besides, who would want to smoke a policeman anyway, it's damn difficult to
584 get them wrapped up in those little papers....
585 
586 On the serious side, I don't expect anything to come of it, it was just a 
587 ballon that Herrington let up to see what the reaction would be. The are
588 many problems with the concept. The biggest being that she can't tell a
589 policeman what he can and can't do when off duty.There have been many cases
590 tried to that effect, and they have always gone in favor of a person being
591 allowed to do what they want on their own time. This is based around the 
592 very concepts of which this country was formed, life, liberty, and the 
593 pursuit of happiness. You have a contractual obligation to perform the
594 duties as assigned you when on the job, and within reason that can even
595 include not smoking if that is a component deemed a negative on the job.
596 If it is in the contract, and you sign it, then you are obligated by the
597 terms of that contract. On the other hand however, In your own time, when
598 you are not under the terms of the contract (generally deemed as when you
599 are not being paid), then you have every right to do what you wish with your
600 life if that includes smoking then there is no reason why not. It is not
601 an illegal activity. Now if he is in uniform, and he signed a contract
602 saying he would not smoke on the job, and he is on his own time but in 
603 uniform, they could concevibly say that he is promoting himself as being on
604 duty by the act of still wearing his uniform, and thus cannot smoke. Of
605 course if they are going to use this argument, then they must accept that
606 he is indeed on duty, and thus must be willing to pay him overtime. 
607 I suspect that that would be more expensive then the insurance. Actually,
608 I can understand some aspects of it. If a person desires to smoke, that
609 is their decision, but on the other hand those that don't wish to should 
610 not have to pay for the privillage of the person to smoke. Smoking is 
611 indeed an expensive habit both in terms of purchasing the cigs, as well as
612 added health costs involved. But, desiganted smoking areas, partners who
613 are compatible, and optional health coverage that the smoker himself can
614 pay. In time something along those lines may come into being, but in the 
615 meantime you'll hear the same old political battles rage of consitutional
616 rights being abused or suspended.
