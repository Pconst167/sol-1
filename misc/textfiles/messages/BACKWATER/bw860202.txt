21      Coughing I stumbled and fell through the open gate. In a moment
22 I recovered. Stepping back I tried to find the gate, My eyes streaming 
23 from the gas. I had to get out of this atmosphere fast. But the gate was 
24 gone, nothing was there. I was starting to panic. I *had* to get out of 
25 here! 
26      I couldn't see my eyes were watering so. I was stumbling around 
27 blindly. I couldn't tell where I was going. I had to find a way out. 
28      A root or something caught my foot and I tripped and fell to the 
29 ground. I must have caused a touch response to occur, because the next 
30 thing I knew something swooped down and grabbed me. As I passed out from 
31 the gasses and lack if oxygen, I realized that I was inside something. 
32 What a way to die I thought, to be eaten alive on some unknown planet in 
33 some unknown demension by some unknown creature.

42 "Gentlemen. Fellow travelers. Please. I have something to say." The noxious gas had captured the attention of the guests
43 and no one seemed to hear the shaky voice from the table at the back of the common room. "PLEASE, kind sirs, listen"
44 A few heads turned, and saw that the old man was holding a book in his hand. "I believe I may be of assistance, sirs"
45 "If I may have complete silence for but a moment, kind sirs..."
46    The Inn fell silent, save the crackeling of the fire, and the rising and falling of labored lungs.
47 Then, there was the barely heard resonance of drones, wailing and fading, coming and going, as if the source of the
48 sound was wandering in circles, seeking release from a whispy and nebulous dimension.
49    Those who watched the old man were suddenly shocked, as the hooded figure blurred and shimmered, and then faded
50 into nothingness. Voices whispered softly. "He's gone. Where...?" "It was the gas. It's taken this strange old man, too"
51 someone suggested. "I wonder who he was?", another guest wondered aloud. 
52 The whispering grew into an uproar as speculations abounded, and the guests grew more restless as the minutes passed.
53    Suddenly the fire in the great stone hearth burst forth flames and smoke filled the common room. Sparks danced
54 upward and outward, across the bar and flitted into the corners. Eyes blinked closed as a flash illuminated the great
55 room, and silence gave way to a cacaphony of voices intertwined with the screech of a chanter and the coughing they
56 had all heard but moments before. The great common room was filled with dense clouds of accrimonious haze that 
57 assaulted the eyes of the guests, bringing tears to their eyes and shouts to their throats.
58 The stout young guest who had helped the now vanished old man leapt to his feet, and feeling his way to the door
59 flung it open. The air whistled past him as the clouds of accrid vapor were whisked outward, and into the night sky.
60 Papers were swept away in the malestrom and linen napkins danced ghostlike in the air. Ripples swept across tankards
61 of ale, whipping the surfaces into mineature storm tossed oceans, and then, as suddenly as the end of a summer
62 storm, all was quiet.
63    The piper walked calmly to the bar, and drew a flagon of the Inn's best ale, the Innkeeper close behind him. They
64 took seats at the table near the door, and drank deeply of the ale. The piper broke the deafening silence. "Friends
65 do we have a story to tell" The Innkeeper nodded in agreement.
66 At a table, near the back of the common room, the old man with the hooded cloak sat silently, waiting....

70    The fat man was laughing, long and wheezing, despite his pain and the gun that was still planted in the center of
71 his bald spot. "Not so easy as it looks, is it, Outsider?" He laughed some more.
72    James counted forty-one guns trained on him and Tariya at this second. Leaning close to her ear, he whispered, "I
73 don't suppose you know any force-field spells, do you?"
74    "No." She looked up at him. "Can't you do something?"
75    "Nope." he sighed. "Too wasted. That's why I grabbed his gun." He looked down at the man. "All right, already. I
76 apologize for trying to steal your car. Would you please call off the neighborhood and we could discuss this
77 calmly?"
78    That set off another fit of laughter. "Discuss all you want. Looter or Outsider, you're still just as dead." Tears
79 were rolling down his cheeks. James silently vowed that if they were dead, so was this turkey.
80    "I don't understand." Tariy cried, "Theft has never been a capital offense in Shai-Kahn, except during a major
81 disaster or... war."
82    "You got it, missy." The laughing man answered. "But you don't have to worry abot dying. You were just an
83 accomplice and besides, target practice is a hell of a waste of good woman flesh. I got two sons that will enjoy
84 making your acquaintance."
85    "No." she whispered, holding on tighter to James. "You've got to do something!"
86    But James didn't answer. His heart was pounding and his mouth was dry. They were trapped. The bulk of his fear was
87 not for himself but for Tariya. Had he been alone he would have gone for broke and shot it out, perhaps even escaping.
88 But there was no way he could protect Tariya and the thought of endangering her was more than he could bear.
89    The laughing man stood up painfully, still chortling. He said, "Now, before he hold a summary execution, how about
90 giving us your names for our records."
91    "Screw you." James snarled.
92    But Tariya was given to a little more dignity than that. She drew herself up with a pride and nobility that James
93 had never guessed she had. "I am Tariya dal-Silmarilyn, last daughter of Marannon Quoasis xennon-Silmarilyn and sixth
94 princess of Shai-Kahn. If any harm comes to us my mother's armies will grind this wretched city to dust!"
95    The man chuckled again, but didn't sound very amused. "Missy, you should count yourself lucky we don't believe
96 that, or you would be executed beside your companion. Speaking of which," he turned to James, "your last chance, boy.
97 Do you want to die unremembered?"
98    He took a deep breath. Might as well. "My name is James Forster Mandell. Some people call me the Destroyer." He
99 prodded the laughing man in the stomach with the rifle. "But you can call me Sir!"
100    Suddenly the laughing man wasn't laughing anymore.
101    Excited whispers came from the windows. The people and rifles began to dissappear. Doors opened and the began to
102 walk out slowly, hesitantly. Most of them had left their rifles inside. The laughing man had now become the pale man
103 as he regarded James with a mixture of awe and terror. From the approaching crowd they could make out the words "The
104 Destroyer!" and "He has come at last!" over and over again.
105    Then they were surrounded by people, all talking at once. A few tried to touch him, and then jerked their hand
106 back, as if touching a leper. Or a savior.
107    James turned to an equally confused an astonished Tariya and said, "Remind me to give my P.R. man a raise when we
108 get out of here, OK?"

116 Now wait a minute! I don't apreciate having an adventure nipped in the bud
117 like that. Shall we just ignore it? Sheesh how can you expect to have an
118 adventure if someone wraps it up before it even gets started?! I intend
119 to ignore the entry and continue on with the story.

122     From Prometheus
123     From the looks of the entry that nipped this adventure in the bud, it was
124 intended to calm everyone down a bit.  Since the vanished had returned with
125 little or no wounds, the story can continue in third person.
126     It would be nice to relate the goings on of the Inn, from moment to moment
127 and I am in favor of it.  I am sure there are a few characters out there who
128 are also, so let us give it a try for once, and see what happens, alright?

    The Sage opened his mouth and poured a little more of the drink down
133 his throat.  It soothed him and yet, it made his thirst even greater still.
134     His eyes were almost shut with dried tears, and bloodshot for fatigue.
135 Still, he poured more and more of the drink into his stomache.  It offered
136 no relief to the Sage and only served to irritate his desires and thirst.
137     The Sage heard a question and did not know who had asked it of him.  It
138 wwas an important question, and the Sage found it difficult to answer, for
139 his alcoholic stupor.  His head tipped back and drank the last of his drink
140 and he almost tipped back and off his chair.
141     A pair of hands grasped the fabric about the collar of the Sage and the
142 question came again.  It was still difficult for him to fathom, and try as
143 he might, it was beyond his poisoned mind right then.
144     Seated again, someone replaced the drink in his hands with a heavier
145 one.  A deeper fill of liquor, a far more potent drug, indeed.
146     Once again, the Sage poured it into his throat and waited for the
147 relief that would never come from it.  In desperation, he poured more down
148 and the relief evaded him.  The drink would never provide it but the addict
149 would never know that, as the Sage imbibed more and more of it.

155 Prometheus: If you had paid attention to the developing story line,
156 and if the aformentioned person had as well, you would have seen that
157 a number of individuals were working to insert themselves into the 
158 story line. I did NOT want the story to be just Piper and me. A multi-
159 author story is of no use with only two authors. After a long dry
160 period we had finally gotten a good fantasy story line going here,
161 and even gotten some writers interested in lending their input who
162 have never really written anything here. And in one fell swoop they
163 are told that they can't join the adventure because it is over with
164 I am not going to tell the story in third person. I am going to ignore
165 the entry because this was intended to be a multi-author story. 
166 I worked damn hard to bring it to the point that it was, and I don't
167 appreciate having it destroyed with a "poof everything is back to 
168 normal" type entry. I intend to ignore it, and I hope that those
169 who wanted to join in the adventure will do so. This was not to be
170 a private adventure between the Piper and me. It is intended to be open
171 to all those who want to try their hand at it. If I'm to be stuck
172 with just the Piper, it is pointless to continue, because the story
173 line is destroyed. If I had intended it to be a two author story I
174 would have directed it that way instead of opening it to all the 
175 patrons. As far as I'm concerned the entry did not happen unless nobody
176 else cares about the adventure, in which case I'll go slink off into
177 my corner and forget about the whole damn thing.

182 Being quite the paranoid creature that I am my first insinct is to 
183 dissapear and find a high perch somewhere safe where I watch what is 
184 going on and maybe help.  I watched the old man in the corner cast his
185 spells.  Something looked very familiar in the motions he was making.
186 It was something I remember doing in my earlier days.  Yes it was it was
187 an illusion spell of some type.  If this is true then that means either
188 that when Piper and the Innkeeper walked back into the in it never really
189 happened or two strange people just walked in as part of the spell.  If the
190 second is true how do I convince the others with out engaging the wrath of
191 the old man in the back of the inn.  I flew down staying invisable and landed
192 on the Juggler's shoulder and whispered "It's a trick!!!  Those two how just
193 walked in aren't as they seem to be.  Don't give away my position I have an
194 idea."  Juggler shook his head and seemed to agree so I flew off to start my 
195 plans.

199 Delta V: You have overlooked two major problems. 
200 1. Fallout/firestorms & other secondary blast effects will kill far more
201    than the Primary blast effects (heat/blast/etc).
202 2. A major attack *would* destroy most if not all of our 'support systems'
203    Transportation, communications, medical.... These tertiary effects
204    would be as bad (if not worse than) the secondary effects. Do you have
205    any idea how long a modern city/town/etc can last without power and
206    without outside supplies (gas, spare parts, medicines, *food*,...)?

208 The apprentice entered the Inn. As he glanced about he noted the
209 strangers. He turned toward the old man. "Milord, this is a fine
210 illusion thou hast cast. But where have the Innkeeper and Piper
211 gone?"
212 He paused, "And who be these strangers that thou hast cloaked 
213 with their guise?"

218 Leonard. You are right. I am wrong. Everyone will die. The world will be totally destroyed. End of argument.
219 While my entry does not fit into what everyone seems to have decided is 'proper' for the Inn, at least when I come along
220 things happen. Someone above has what *I* think is the right idea ( as far as writing goes) which is to create a way
221 of changing something (make it into an illusion eg) instead of bitching.
222 Well, anyway, after this response I think I will stick to being DELTA FIVE, and Lysias will find another watering hole.

254     Cistop Mikey, I had no idea you were trying to establish
255 another of the stories which have more than one author.  If I
256 had known, I certainly wouldn't have defended the entry to you.

263 A moment or a millenium later (time is such a relative thing!), Milchar found
264 himself deposited on a very large, flat rock in a desolate spot on an alien
265 world.  Perhaps this was an example of the beauty this world had to offer,
266 but Milchar didn't believe it.  He peered through the thick yellow atmosphere
267 at the surrounding territory, which promised to be every bit as dull as the
268 patch he occupied.
269 After getting up and brushing himself off, Milchar searched for the portal
270 he had come through.  Several minutes later he gave up.  "No where to be found,"
271 he muttered to himself.  "I wonder if anyone saw me leave."
272 Since the rock was not producing answers, and Milchar had no guarantee that
273 either Piper or the Innkeeper whad been deposited at the same place, Milchar
274 saw that he must choose a direction to walk.  Again Milchar shuffled through
275 his packet of 3x5 cards; this time, however, he failed to find a suitable
276 finding-spell.  He shrugged and put the cards away, then began at a brisk pace
277 in the direction he faced.  He noted his breathing-spell was still working
278 well, but occasionally Milchar would get a whiff of the vile gas surrounding
279 him.  The thought of the Innkeeper and Piper breathing the poisonous stuff
280 caused Milchar to move faster.  Perhaps, though, the special properties of
281 Piper's instrument would aid him.

288 Prometheus: No need to apologize. I may have reacted a bit strongly, but 
289 I was a bit upset to have the story terminated just as it was getting 
290 underway. 
291 #######################################################################
292     The rotting stench was overpowering, so much so that it drowned out 
293 the burning, seering atmosphere. <cough> Stench? I am still alive! I can 
294 breath!  Where ever I am there must be oxygen in here. I lifted my hand 
295 to wipe the tears from my eyes, but stopped short when the smell of the 
296 muck that covered it came near my nose. 
297      I can't stay here, the acid this stuff is generating will start to 
298 digest me too soon. Off in the distance I head a horrid screeching 
299 noise. It sounded like a pig being strangled... Piper! He was around 
300 here someplace. Maybe there is a way out of this mess yet. 
301      I started to crawl towards the opening of whatever I was in, my 
302 hand slipped on a round object. Odd, I wonder what this is? It seemed to 
303 be a hard solid ball of some sort. Trying to get a look at it in the dim 
304 yellow light that filtered in I could have sworn it was getting smaller. 
305 As I watched it did get smaller within a matter of seconds it 
306 disappeared completely. Very odd. Thinking nothing more of it, I headed 
307 towards the small opening ahead hopefully to flag down the Piper. 
308      As I pried open the entrance the foul yellow atmosphere rushed in 
309 causing me to gag. At the same time a voice spoke in my head #Ahhh...
310 intellegence at last...#

313 
Does anyone remmember the "hallway of life"?  It is a long room with many
314 
doors each with a sign above it like "love" or "greed" or "desire" ect.
315 
There is a machine in the center of the room that dispenses what I call
316 
a "escape", the "escape" will bring you back to the hallway when you use
317 
it.  All kinds of different paths to choose from here, just like life.
318 
And what looks good today?  Hmmmm, "disorientation" looks "fun". Here goes.
319 
    I walk to the machine and carefully take my escape, placing it in my
320 
pocket.  Since I have already made up my mind, the door to "disorientation"
321 
flies open and I see a wonderful landscate, mountains and my favorite of
322 
vices, SNOW  (yahoo).
323 
    I plunge through the door to find myself up to my knees in some very
324 
heavy snow and a stiff wind is blowing and me in a sweater and jeans. I
325 
can see that the sun is heading for the hills and I need to survive the
326 
evening, I wade through the snow to a drift and start digging with my hands.
327 
Scrape scrape, One nail down, nine to go, strangly enough I find the remains
328 
of a snow caveand go about making it usefull again.  I crawl inside and pull
329 
down the snow over the opening to seal me in for the evening.
330 
    After a rather cold period of time, I believe that it is day and try to
331 
find a way out, the exit I have made for myself seems to have blended in
332 
and I'm not to sure which way is out.  My clothing os now very wet from the
333 
evening and I'm miserable to be sure, but I plod on scratching in the snow.
334 
More snow and more, Ive created quite a maze of little tunnels and they
335 
all seem to lead back to the same place.
336 
    Ok, I think to myself, this is "disorientation" since I have been digging
337 
where I think "out" ism then maybe I should dig where I think "out" isn't.
338 
    This logic seems to work as I dig down and find sunshine and more snow.
339 
I'm really in poor condition now, But I want to find the answer, if there
340 
is one.  I head down the mountain.  Traveling is slow, and the snow is getting
341 
deeper as I head for the valley and tree's.   Tree's, hey that's the answer
342 
as I climb up one, tearing my soggy clothes in the process, I can't seem to
343 
get high enough to see anything different.  It all seems the same, But at
344 
least Im out of the snow.  
345 
     The sun warms my back and my clothes begin to steam and all I can see
346 
is trees and snow and wolves. (what?  Wolves?) Matter of fact, lot's of
347 
wolves, wolves uder every tree, howling up at me.  So here I sit in a tree,
348 
surrounded by trees that all look alike, growing up out of snow that all
349 
looks alike and being drooled over by blood thirsty wolves that of course
350 
all look alike.  And a helicopter flies over, I wave and shout and hear a
351 
echo of myself shouting, wait... tha's not a echo, its' other people all
352 waving and shouting from the trees around me, hold on a second, they
353 
(the other people) all look like me, se we have a million people in a million
354 
trees being drooled over by a million wolves in the snow.  That's enough
355 
I say to myself as I pull out my escape, and of course a million other
356 
people pull out their escapes too.  
357 
     I feel the branch break and I hear the wolf smaking his/her lips and
358 
aa million branches break, the wolves won't be hungry tonight.  As the
359 
helicopter flies off with the footage of tonights news.

362   Sometimes there are rewards for moving fast.  Sometimes there are rewards
363 for acting fast.  Sometimes there are rewards for thinking fast and acting.
364 Sometimes the rewards for acting fast without thinking are rather unpleasant.
365   Something about the out-of-tune pipes seemed to interact with the dimension
366 al gateway.  The operation seemed to slow, giving the piper ample time to 
367 observe what was happening -- not the ability to control it, simply the time
368 to observe.
369   A tiny point, about chest-high appeared in the air before him.  Spurts of
370 vapor jetted from it into the room, swirling as it mixed with the smokey air
371 in the fire-lit darkness.  Quickly the piper sucked in a lungful of clean 
372 air before the vapors reached him.  Stepping forward, he surrendered to the
373 pull of the dimensional gate, fingers flickering along the chanter.
374   The plan was simple -- go through, find the inkeeper, return.  The execution
375 of the plan was not.  The piper began to realize that he was in big trouble
376 when his eyes began to tear so badly that he could not track the innkeeper.
377 My God! How could anyone survive in this unholy soup?  Drones beginning to
378 sag... time for another breath.  Great -- breath of what?  Where's the
379 inkeeper's body?  Just enough air to shift out of this reality...
380   The pipes let out a sudden squawk as the remains of his breath was forced
381 out of the piper.  Why did he have the feeling that something was walking
382 along a giant buffet table?

385 The two imposters tried to convince the group that they were who they seemed
386 to be.  While they talked I had to work fast.  I had thought that the old man's
387 powerful spell had created the two strangers, but there seems to be another
388 that helps the two maintain their present form.  I omly hope I am a powerful
389 enough wizard to dissolve the illusion.  I will need Cragmore's help.  So
390 quickly I composed a note and invisably flew down and placed it in his hands
391 .  It startled him at first but then he read the message.  It read.....
392     
393           Cragmore,
394                   Your psi powers are very strong almost as strong as a
395            partner I once had from another world.  I need your assistance.
396            If you could use your powers to distract the two strangers then
397            that may give me the advantage I need to take care of them.  You
398            see if their minds are full with another problem then they can't
399            put as much concentration into the spell.  Hope you understand.
400                                Thank You
401                                     Ripple
402 
403 I watched as Cragmore read the note.  He did seem to understand,  and when
404 I thought he had made contact I started my own spell.  Making the proper
405 movements and chanting the correct words I could feel the ball of energy
406 forming in front of me.  All at once I released it.  There was a large flash
407 of light that seemed to engulf the imposters then there was complete darkness.

by golly, yes I do.  The hallway comes into focus the doors all in their place.

I stagger to the machine and take a escape.  The door to "recouperation" is

434 Since The recent loss in the space program, this "tradgedy" has set my 
435 to wondering.  I pose the  following questions:
436 1.  Is the press reliable?
437 2.  Does our government have the power to mask the release of all facts?
438 3.  Can this be some kind of hoax to falsify the real purpose of this last
439 mission?

453 #Well, I think you'll find that it isn't entirely a negative thing to
454 have a parisite. Consider; the bacteria that inhabit your digestive tract
455 you would have a great difficulty digesting your food without them. Just
456 think of me along those terms.# Yeah, so what good are you then? What do
457 you offer me in exchange for using my body? #Many things, for starters,
458 notice that you have been standing outside in the atmosphere that you 
459 were unable to breath before, and yet you are able to breath it with

511     "But Odd one, I don't understand what you mean. If in my sobriety I
512 find peace and contentment, why should not I stay away from such feelings
513 through inhebriation, since I have promised myself never to all myself
514 feelings of peace and contentment because of what I have been responsible
515 for in the past when I tried to utilize my special powers of sight and 
516 healing and advice for the people who trusted me after they found me
517 almost morally wounded in the side by the boar who had rushed me as I
518 sat by the cool stream and clensed my body and my soul after both had
519 been soiled in the last town at that house of ill repute and the ladies
520 who live inside the house whose job it is to dirty body and soul and are
521 paid good money for it because they can find no other work and they are
522 forced by lean task masters to continue their vigil into the night searching
523 for those men who seek such feelings of gratification be it empty and devoid
524 of any true feelings because they are unable to return such feelings to
525 those they are with since their childhoods were corrupted by bad parents
526 who did not care anything for them and made them stay at home while they
527 were out spending money and enjoying themselves and not carrying for 
528 their children because that is the same way they were treated by their
529 parents because their parents where drinkers who never strayed far from
530 the devil drink and never had a moment of peace and contentment because
531 they have promised themselves never to have such feelings, just like I
532 did."
