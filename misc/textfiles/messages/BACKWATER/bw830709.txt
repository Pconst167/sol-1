107     A man swathed in black robes confidently approaches
108 the Inn. As he grows near he is puzzled by the 
109     growing din from within. He cautiously peers through
110  the portal to see why this would be so. In dismay 
111   he finds no one of familar voice from within. As
112   he continues his survey of the patrons within,
113  he finaly spies the Innkeeper in the back at a
114     small table in the corner, his head in his arms,
115  fast asleep despite the din. 
116      The man in the black robes sadly turns away, for
117      the Inn has changed and it is no longer companionable
118    to him. As he slowly trudges back down the road to
119     his abode. A single glistening tear falls to the
120     ground in rememberance of that which once was.

128 Reagan's idea about the MX missile (densepac
129 I thought was a stupid idea. TThere is absolutely no way to win
130 a nuclear war. In effect, he was saying that if they fired missiles
131 at us, we'd fire them right back. So, the only alternative is to
132 totally inihalate ourselves, which in turn, screws us up from
133 living any longer. Why don't we just deploy all of our missiles
134 into space and forget about it?

176     1) SOCAIL SECURITY TO THOSE NOT OVER 65 (LIKE PAYING KIDS
177        TO GO TO COLLEGE ON SS)
178     2) WELFARE TO THOSE WHO ARE SO STUPID THEY CONTINUOUSLY GET
179        PREGNANT (WOMEN ONLY).  THIS I SEE AS THE ONLY REASON
180        FOR PUBLIC PAID ABORTIONS AND/OR HYSTERECTOMIES
181     3) MONEY FOR PET PROGRAMS (LIKE THE STUDY OF WILD TASMANIAN
182        WOMBAT MATING HABITS).
183     4) MONIES ALLOCATED FOR CONGRESSIONAL PAY RAISES (MOSTLY
184        DEMOCRATIC SPONSERED MEASURES), AND FOR NIFTY LITTLE

193    The gates open abruptly; the girl, in startled reaction, hastens into
194 their shadow to let the boisterous crowd pass.  One spies her, and with a
195 hoot of derisive laughter, makes a mock bow and continues on his way,
196 roaring.  Flushed with anger at this discourtesy, she does not favor him
197 with a 	word.  She takes a resolute step away from the still-open doorway,
198 but a voice calls her name, spoken mildly and respectfully, and extends an
199 invitation.  A hesitant smile crosses her face, and she opens her mouth as
200 if to speak to the stranger...but she seems inexplictably unsure of how to
201 respond.  He pauses, watching her, melding amiably with the crowd when she
202 does not answer.  So she lingers, a hand gingerly resting on the open door,
203 to observe distant figures make their approach.  A black-berobed gentleman
204 looks somewhat familiar, and the girl shades her eyes the more intently to
205 peer at him.  "Could it be...?"  she murmers, noting his aghast reaction to
206 the speech floating out so loudly from the Inn.  She unconsciously takes
207 another step from behind the door, upon which a livery boy from the Inn
208 notices her.  The child comes running, to breathlessly report:  "A fellow
209 named Aaron has been seeking you, my Lady.  Shall I bring a message back
210 to him?"  At this she smiles, and tousles the child's hair.  "You may..."
211 she replies slowly.  "It seems my friends are indeed here!  Tell the Keeper
212 of the Inn, and Aaron, that I come to sup here this evening.  And would
213 you be so gracious as to tell the Believer that he is missed in the quiet
214 corners of the Inn?"  "I will, my Lady!"  he cried out as he tore off to
215 the Backwater Inn...upon which the girl loosened her cloak, and followed.

267    Sure old FDR did a few good things, but all those good things
268 did not bring the US economy out of the depression of the 30's,
269 it was World War II.  Sure we got out of the depression, the
270 hard way.....  Just think, if MRonny didn't start the current
271 troubles...they started in 77 &78.  Give the Republicans 30
272 years control of house/senate and then we can make a judgement.
273 
274    Sure criticize Nixon for Watergate, and Reagan for Debate-
275 gate...I personally think that we should lock Nixon up and
276 throw away the key....but not for Watergate, but for STUPIDITY!!

290 As for poitics:
291 If all the hot air blown by the poiticians over economics was used, we
292 could put Woops back on line, with windmils, but the sad truth is they
293 have almost no control over the economy. They can hurt it, but help it?
294 The record sholws otherwise (and this goes for both D____ and R____.)
295 I must agree with the comment about "give --- 30 years" because it is
296 possible that any "economic policy" would work in time: or, in other
297 words, given time we could work around it. One of the killers of the 
298 economy is uncertainty, and we get plenty of this, every time we seem to
299 have a little trouble, change something. How can a person, or a company
300 plan for the future if he cant't know what it will be? Not that any
301 change, whatever it is will help somebody, but hurt some one else; the
302 game is to try to help your friends. The US would probably run better if
303 we shot every politician after 5 years of politics, and everyone involved
304 supporting him (a lot of power is never seen publicly, it's in the back.)
305 However, the US isn't alone, and the rest of the world would step in when
306 we were headless, and that means you-know-who. We need professional
307 ploiticians. 
308 Now, how do we make government more useful to us, the citizens? Don't say
309 get more political, that is what we are trying to get away from!
310 1. Require totally carrying out of all campaign promises.
311 2. Make this part of his pay: anything not done is not payed for.
312 3. Subtract from his pay twice what he makes outside of government, in 
313 any form, including trusts, increase in value of his property, lecture
314 payments, etc.
315 4.  We are now at a point wher we can actually ask the
316 people what they want, by electronic means, and get this to the pols fast
317 enough for them to use the data. We don't need them to take surveys, just
318 tell them directly. Unfortunately, this requires the teller to know what
319 is going on; if the experts (politicians and their staff0 don't know, what
320 is the chance that the man in the street would? Not a lot.
321 5. In that pamphlet that the state sends out, giving each candidates claims,
322 include a section where each one gives 5 issues, and each candidate must
323 answer these, and the same from all others candidates. And include the
324 voting record of each, if he has one. Maybe we could find out who to vote
325 for.
326 6. Make any lies in a campaign automatic disqualification.

328 In the question of the jail: If you take all the alluded hint as facts, 
329 then only one combination works, but facts in jails are not usually true,
330 so unless strictly stated, can not be used as such, leaving much open.
331 Therefore, there is no "correct", or even, to his possible rescuer,
332 useful answer, since an error would probably land her there too. Don't
333 ask for the best: of 10 wrong answers, which is best? Easy:none.

337    In his advanced Theory of Knowledge class at the Academy, that
338 good ol' Professor Plato taught that for every material object on the planet
339 (including the planet itself) there existed in a far off heaven-like realm
340 a perfect IDEA of that particular thing that was eternal, incorruptible,
341 immaterial, and (I'm extrapolating here) non-carcinogenic, rust proof, and
342 warranted for life! Furthermore, these IDEAS are somehow more real than thei
343 manifestations on Earth, which are just shadowy reproductions with the quali
344 of a xeroxed Mona Lisa!
345    This concept of a supreme deity being portrayed as THE GREAT XEROX
346 OPERATOR,
347 who not only runs off copies, but imperfect and faded copies at that,
348 caused me considerable personal anguish, not to mention raising some most
349 disturbing cosmological & theological questions:
350    Are the original IDEAS copyrighted? And if they are, by Whom? And for
351 what duration of time ?(eternity?)
352    Who gets the royalty payments for the reproduced material?
353    Who (or what) built the Xerox Machine-in-the-Sky?
354    And, by implication, was it always there ad infinitum, or was it built
355 ex nihilo?
356    Who services the Machine when it breaks down? (Or runs out of fluid?)
357    And, by extension, who pays for these charges, or are they "taken care
358 of"?, and to whom?
359    Does God own the machine outright, or does he lease it?

430 LET US BRING UP SOME "REAL" ARGUMENTS
431 OTHER THAN THEIS IDLE TALK ABOUT POLITICS
432 LONG PAST.  WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET INTO
433 SOME REALLY HEAVY DISCUSSION,?
434    HOW ABOUT WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE
435 MANUFACTURERS OF "NEW" COMPUTERS THAT
436 ARE REALLY "GOOD".  ALL WE SEE ON THE
437 MARKET THESE DAYS ARE EITHER COPIES OF
438 MACHINES ALREADY ONBEING SOLD, OR NEWER
439 COMPUTERS THAT ARE JUST JUNK!
440    WHAT ABOUT THE CORPORATIONS WHO USED
441 TO MANUFACTURE GOOD EQUIPTTMENT, BUT
442 HAVE TURNED INTO SELLERS OF GARBAGE.
443    FIRST SINCLAIR MARKETED A COMPUTER
444 THAT WAS VERY LOW COST, THEN THEY LET
445 TIMEX PRODUCE IT EVEN CHEAPER, AND LOOK
446 WHAT IT TURNED OUT AS...JUNK!
447 WHO CAN TYPE ON A KEYBOARD THE SIZE OF
448 A WALLET?  APPLE FIRST CAME OUT WITH
449 A FAIRLY GOOD COMPUTER, BUT THEY REALLY
450 NEVER MADE ANY GOOD IMPROVEMENTS, SO
451 EVENTUALLY THEY CAME OUT WITH THE IIE.
452 WHAT IS THIS COMPUTER BUT A CHEAPER
453 REPLICATION OF THE FIRST WITH ITS CHIPS
454 MOVED AROUND? IT DOESN'T EVEN RUN ALL
455 OF THE ]['S SOFTWARE.
456    I THINK THAT THE COMPUTER MARKET IS
457 GOING DOWN THE DRAIN.  THERE ARE 
458 A FEW COMPANYS THAT REMAIN SOLID
459 HOWEVER. (LUCKY FOR US!)

464   IN REVIEWING THIS SYSTEM FOR THE PAST MONTH, I HAVE OBSERVED SOME 
465 VERY INTERESTING PHENOMENA CONCERNING THE USERS. (OF COURSE, WHAT OTHER
466 PHENOMENA ARE THERE ?)
467   FIRST, it seems as though there are those who simply try to beat
468 a dead horse. That is, they either dwell in a fantasy world of

481    Yes, we Do have LOTS of room for Females here. In fact, the
482 guys are usually more boring that Females are.
483    I'm called TRON. Call me that from now on. What kinda terminal
484 are you using? Just curious.... I met a girl skating once and
485 just wondered if it was you. Her name was Lori also.

494 re:Dead Horses
495   if you don't like it,leave it,change
496    it,or ignore it,and if you still
497      feel that some of us are lost in
498        a land of fantasy
499  Take thee a sword of good strength
500    and fine temper,and sever that which
501      fetters thee,thine cord of life
502        of wizard Bell design.
503 
504  No,but seriously,one cannot judge the
505  relative merits of a medium such as
506  BW (nor the mental condition of it's
507  users,for that matter),by examining
508  the content(or apparent lack of it!)
509 of the information exchanged there.
510  In the end,the justification for ANY
511  medium lays in the effect on the 
512 users,and as long information is 
513 exchanged,a mingling of minds,a chance
514 for an insight into the condition of
515 the fellow inhabitants of spaceship
516 earth exists,and in the end,isn't
517 this enough????????

564 The "conversation" in this inn is no debate or real conversation-
565 There is no real presentation of ideas or meeting of minds,
566 only the idle chatter, and manipulative word-play found
567 extensivly in cocktail parties. One could easily find these same
568 words and "conversations" at such a cocktail party.

572 To Mike Day     Fm Adam Trent      Sj  Deadly Handshake in AMODEM
573 Thanks for the info, I'll give it a try next time I hook the KAYPRO
574 up to the 8 in. system (within a couple weeks).  I'll let you know
575 the results.      I re-read the DOC file on AMODEM and just
576 discovered the CTRL-Y flips me in and out of console logging to the
577 T file.  NEATO!  Didn't know this before--was using MAKE, CLOSE before.
578 What other golden nuggets will time uncover?
