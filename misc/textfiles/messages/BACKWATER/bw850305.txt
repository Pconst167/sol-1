20 L'homme: Interesting about the Jr, about as I expected, the Hardware is fixed
21 at the com2 location, and it is only switched via software. The question is,
22 why? It only confuses the whole issue. Oh well, who can ever understand why
23 IBM does anything? Glad to hear you like COPYLINK, I think you'll enjoy 3.0
24 even more, it has a langauge built in, not you faky script file type thing,
25 but a basic like language. It is based on the original COPYLINK instruction
26 format with extentions. It will be going back into beta test again (after
27 the last batch of fixes/changes) in about a week or so. I'll bring along the
28 errata sheet for the 2.41 version which tells how to fix some bugs in the
29 xmodem xfer and log strings. It also has a patch for boosting the speed 
30 of operation when running under dos 2.0 and above. (Fools it into thinking
31 it is running under dos 1.0) It seems there was too much checking going on
32 under dos 2.0 so everything started to slow down a bit. I'll also bring
33 the manual. A quick note, to down load to BWMS via COPYLINK, setup the
34 end of line function. To do so enter the command "SET EOL" It will respond
35 with "Not configured, you you want to change it?" You respond by entering
36 "Y", It will then respond by giving you a short editing menu for the SET
37 command, and leave the cursor sitting at the left margin. At this point,
38 type the following (letters in CAPs) "<cr><esc>Z10<ret><esc>X". <cr> means
39 enter a return, and <esc means type an escape. What this does is when you
40 do a Blind send, it will look for a CR/LF pair in the file, and when it
41 finds it it will replace it with the EOL string. in this case the EOL string
42 being '(0D)(8A)' which is send a carraige return, and wait one second.
43 The delay was entered by typing the <esc>Z10<cr> Where the <esc>Z tells the
44 editor that the data following is a command and not data, and the '10' is
45 is the delay time in tenths of seconds. (1-99 allowed). The <esc>X tells
46 the editor that you are done, and returns you to command mode. In reality,
47 what the <esc>Z does is to add 80H to the number you add after it and
48 when the string is processed it sees the 8th bit on and knows that it is
49 a command byte, and not a data byte. Normally anything you type is assumed
50 to be data to be transmitted. An exception to this is if you enter 3
51 numeric digits instead of 2 or 1, in which case the 80H will not be added
52 on, and the decimal value given will be directly encoded into the string
53 thus to be able to send a null, you could enter '<esc>Z000'. note that
54 no CR is required, since the 3rd digit automaticly terminates the ESC Z
55 funtion. Typing <esc>Z0<cr> is a special command that modifies the wait
56 command into an idle command. That is if it is entered before the wait
57 command '(0D)(80)(8A)' it says to wait until there has been no data recv'd
58 for one second. I have found that this combination has allowed me to be 
59 able to transmit to over 90% of the systems I've encountered. And for that
60 extra 10% there are even more commands available. But rather then describing
61 them here, I'll bring yo the manual thursday, and you can see them yourself.

63 Pam, I'm waiting for that next installment.... <ahem>

89 Peanut butter? hmm.. That's a new one.  See even us kinks keep finding new ways
90 to eliminate even the possibility of bordom.  Sorry but the barbed wire is out.
91 Not my style, but if there's a market I may be able to do some commission work.
92 I'm no salesman but I have a few connections.
93   What did everyone think of the Freud poem?  Admitted it is quite a deviation
94 from most of my stuff, but I am inordinately proud of it.  It is the first thing
95 I have done that actually rhymed.  I have been tring to do a "real" poem, for
96 some time now, and had been completely frustrated.  I think I was inspired by
97 a combination of Silverstine and Gaham Wilson.  It came out real fast.
98   This is not an invitation for ego-stroking; if you liked it say so, if you
99 didn't say why.  It is the second phase of my working to improve my writing,
100 the first being simply to write regularly.
101   I am reminded of what a comic said after one of his jokes bombed," It's good
102 that you didn't laugh.  It encourges me to improve."

113 A Spy story of a slightly different kind...
114                             Birds of a Feather
115 
116     Cold, dark, and rainy. It was a Hell of a night to be outside. It was
117 obvious nature was firmly against my efforts. Why don't I listen to Mother and
118 get inside where it is warm and dry? No, that wouldn't do at all. I've got
119 blocks to go, before I sleep, and appointments with destiny to keep. What a
120 poet.
121     Maybe I shouldn't blame this whole thing on destiny. After all, it was
122 my decision to become a spy. No one coerced me, well not too much at least.
123 So I was a young and aspiring government courier, looking for a little more
124 excitement out of life. I guess I got what I wished for. Plenty of excitement;
125 ignoring the flying bullets, enraged governments, and sinister enemy spies
126 from the other side trying to do it to me before I did it to them.
127     But who am I to complain? The pay is good, the perks are great. I can 
128 ignore the occasional knife wound and feel I am doing more for my country
129 than the average Ivan who every Sunday cracks a six-pack and becomes a
130 couch potato. I am doing something for my country! I help further the
131 goals of my glorious country, who's only ambition is to make the world a
132 better place to live and bring up plenty of children. Some countries call
133 it imperialism; I think they are jealous of the strength of our nation and
134 the well defined purpose of our goals. Not many other countries around the
135 world can claim that their destiny has already been put down on paper more
136 than 100 years ago by a man of great vision. Other great nations on this
137 earth point to their own national texts, claiming that our country is not
138 so different. They confuse manifesto with guidelines; guidelines that
139 are open to free interpretation.
140     But I digress. I am out here on this dreadful night because I am on a
141 mission. I remember so clearly what the head of the organization said to
142 me before I left.
143 
144         "Comrade, it is imperative that you complete this mission. You must
145 not and can not fail. Our glorious empire can not continue its glorious
146 plan until you eliminate your target. You have been briefed, you know what
147 to do. I will not wish you good luck. Men like ourselves can not and do not
148 rely on happenstance. When you return, the mother country will salute you
149 as a hero!"
150 
151     Enough to make a grown spy cry. So here I am, stalking my prey, like
152 the great white hunter of the dark continent. I had observed him for many
153 days now. I knew his routine, although he attempted to disguise it. I
154 observed his actions with great care. Oh there is no doubt he is good, one
155 of the best. But I am better, I am here to kill him. 
156     While waiting for him to come down from the apartment across the
157 street, I have time to rethink my plan. He spends most of his evenings
158 painting the town, always with a different woman. The plot is always
159 the same. He and the woman return to her apartment. A more virile man I
160 have never seen! Sometime in the early hours of the morning, he makes
161 his escape. I have seen this exodus without deviation every night so far.
162 As the taxi arrives and he enters, I see the smile on his face; and the new
163 notch on his gun. He doesn't know I follow him. I have taken advantage of
164 his slightly drunken and euphoric state. Before a taxi comes, I will meet
165 him. A jealous husband, a jilted boyfriend, it doesn't matter. He has
166 a reputation, the authorities won't look too deep. I know all this because
167 I have done my homework. The plan is perfect in its simplicity. I can not
168 and will not fail.
169     I check my watch. It is nearly four A.M. He should be leaving any
170 minute now.I move into position, my cloak pulled tight around me as a
171 defense against the weather. My gun is in my left hand. An instrument of
172 death, an instrument for life. The doors open, and he steps out. Tall,
173 handsome, much more so than I. I step from around the corner. He hears me.
174 He is smiling.
175 
176         "At last we meet face to face. I have wondered how long it would take
177 you to build up enough courage."
178         I try not to act surprised. My face does not reveal my shock at his
179 words, his knowing. "Courage has nothing to do it. I am cautious, I make my
180 plans carefully."
181         "Caution does not enter in to it, or you wouldn't be here, holding
182 that Karmakov on me."
183         "You are very skilled, but you make one mistake, with the ladies. You
184 leave before breakfast, when the streets are all but deserted, save the cab
185 that comes to pick you up and take you home. Tonight, the cab will have a 
186 slightly different mission."
187         "Then you mean to kill me, here and now. No pomp, just streetside
188 murder." His voice seemed to grow a bit quieter. Or was it my imagination?
189         "It is for the greater good." And then smiling add, "Don't take it
190 personally, ok?"
191         "Ok!"
192 
193     Things here began to move very quickly. I saw the glint of the mercury
194 vapor street lights in his silver gun. Standard HMSS issue. I fired, he fired.
195 He fell, I fell. My side was like a flaming torch, throbbing waves of pain.
196 I could feel the warm blood as it poured out between my fingers where my
197 right hand had raced as if to plug a simple leak. I was on my side, and I
198 could see him. No better condition than I. No movement at all, only a barely
199 audible rasp.
200     Lights tracked across the wall of the apartment building above me. The
201 taxi was coming. the lights of the taxi grow dimmer, but it is getting closer.
202 The taxi that was supposed to take me away from this, to the airport, where
203 I would return home, to a hero's welcome.

234    I see that objections have been raised to the thought that sex is boring.
235 Come, now, friends--if sex (kinky or otherwise) is all you need to keep you
236 from boredom, what are you doing in this Inn?  Surely it is frequented at
237 hours when many of its patrons might otherwise be in bed....  The point made
238 by Roz has been missed.  Sex is not obsolete--it simply isn't ENOUGH for
239 humankind, as at the dawn of history, it presumably was.
240    Lady S:  You are on the right track--the human race is young and
241 precocious and plays with dangerous toys more from curiosity than from
242 boredom of the depairing sort.  But it is TIME to play with more
243 CONSTRUCTIVE toys.  The common view that "Earth is room enough" and/or "all
244 we've got" would be merely sad if it were not so perilous.  Humankind has
245 satisfied its curiosity about how to make things go BOOM, and having done
246 so, must move on.  That is how things work in this galaxy, and for that
247 matter, in others....

293     And some people wonder about why some people attack dial.  I have heard one
294 or two things about it causing leprosy, but I attribute these tales to the
295 imagination of attack dialers.
296     I personally have found that attack dialers give up on being bored for
297 all intents and purposes, and instead concentrate on releiving their boredom.
298 Makes more sense than people who sit around taslking about how bored all this
299 talking is getting to be.
300 
301     All of this is leading up to something.  And I think it is that sure things
302 can become really boring, but at least there is momentary releif.  And if Roz,
303 our friend from the lecture circuit, think that nothing can releive boredom:
304 then  perhaps he ought to stop attending the lectures and head for somethin
305 like international espionage or maybe even minelaying.

323      I cannot see her face.  But she radiates an incredible beauty, as well
324 as a feeling of great age.  She stands before me, tall and graceful, her
325 posture indicating a lithe strength of body and character.  Her clothing is
326 an elaborate floor length dress festooned with bows and lace: a wedding
327 gown, but all in a shade of black such as that which greets horrified eyes
328 upon waking from a nightmare.  It is old and torn, with holes that appear
329 to be caused by decay, and sprinkled with dust and what seems to be mold.
330 Her face is veiled, her head covered, only her voice, dress, and body
331 betray her gender.

332      "You... startled me," I stammer, "I'm sorry to have used your home
333 without your leave, I was lost, I needed a place to sleep," I continue for
334 awhile, embarassed and disconcerted at being found here without permission.
335 "Uh, you have a lovely home," I end lamely.

336      At this she laughs, and her laugh is a direct contradiction to her
337 appearance.  Deep and sincere, it bursts forth in wonderful tones, a
338 marvelous litany of joy.  "You are always welcome here, and you may stay as
339 long as you wish, though for this trip I suspect your stay will be short."
340 She steps forward, and she continues in a voice as smooth as oil on water.
341 "I know that you are confused, so let me explain.  You are in county Shay,
342 the land of Klee, a world much like your own.  This is a place where old
343 ideals come to die, and worn out concepts wait patiently to be called to
344 life again by the unimaginative."  Slowly, dreamlike, she reclines on the
345 couch across from me, and as she pulls her legs onto the cushions and
346 adjusts the folds of her gown a moth flutters silently from within.  "Why
347 have you come here?  To lay to rest more of your tarnished ideals?  To dig
348 more coal from the mine of overused ideas?  Or perhaps you merely wish
349 to... join me?"  Extending her hand to me, I feel a powerful urge to grasp
350 it, to hold it to my breast, to promise that I'll never leave.  "Join
351 me..." she again whispers.

352      The compulsion is so strong, I begin to feel that I can't resist.  But
353 the memories of past manipulation by others begin to crowd into my mind,
354 and I grasp at them as though I was drowning.  "I will not be controlled!"
355 I shout, "No more!  Not again!"  I stumble backwards, fall over a chair,
356 regain my feet, and burst through the front door at a run.

357      Her laughter follows me, and it isn't a mocking laugh, but instead one
358 filled with compassion.  "Enjoy your stay in Klee, child, do stop by again
359 before you leave," her words echo through the trees.

366      area should be discouraged, if necessary by force from ever mentioning
367      "assembly required" or battery not included in their    sales calls.
368                 It cannot be overemphasized that our mission is to traffic those
369      transformer toys and modems to keep kids of all ages from their school works.
370                 To avoid detection, the cheap also suggested to use subterfuge,
371      such as assuming false identities, representing themselves to school author-
372      ities as, say, peanut butter derivatives or peachee folder salesmen.
373                 The cheap also will discontinue umbrella/raincoat allowance imme-
374      diately.  All would now have the option whether to work or not
375                      if it rains.
376                               END OF TEXT
377 Dragon Lady: I was being rather cyrptic on CBBS/Aloha as I did not want to
378 broadcast my identities to all and sundry. And since Jim & Louann can read
379 even the private msgs, I have to consider what I want THEM to know. I had
380 hoped that by SPECIFICLY denying the one identity (Piper) and not saying
381 anything about the other three, that you would infer that you were correct 
382 about THEM. I referred you to PAM for another of my identities as that 
383 "mask" serves a VERY important (to me, at least) purpose on systems other
384 than Backwater  (and on at least one of those systems it would become useless
385 if the Sysop knew it was "me"). I freely discuss this sort of thing in person
386 (which I realize is of no help to you). OR we can exchange PRIVATE msgs on
387 The Messenger (639-xxxx), as the sysop there is aware of my identities and
388 won't mention them to the wrong people. I know you would not do so either,
389 but I'm not so sure about Mr. Bell. 
390         If you do wish to leave me msgs on The Messenger, address them to
391 Leonard.

398 Ink-stained hands,
399 casualties of poetic meandering,
400 flutter with nervous tension
401 that comes of long lying still in my lap.
402 Tears trace a path to my chin
403 there to drop or evaporate,
404 joining, perhaps the dampness in the air,
405 leaving faint cobwebs behind.
406 After the tears have dried,
407 after I spend the unmeasurable time
408 gazing with blank eyes
409 into the immeasurable distance,
410 the energy begins to return
411 in pin-pricks of feeling
412 that stir me to life once again,
413 hands and mind a-flutter.

416 Not being into overly analyzing stories, it tickles me when I actually notice
417 what has been hidden.  To wit - the land of Klee, county of Shay.

424 Pam: Well! You finally got the next installment put up here!
425 It looks ok, though I must confess that it did get
426 just a tad bit dry and long winded getting to the point. I
427 think maybe you're starting to get just a bit too verbose
428 in your descriptions. By the time you got done describing
429 it I started to lose track of what you were describing.
430 Thus causing a loss in being able to follow the plot. I think
431 maybe you're starting to fall in that old trap of spending
432 to much time describing something, and not enough on how the 
433 story flows. <ahem> Now that I've got you mad at me for 
434 telling you all the bad things I saw... The story line itself
435 I like, it is very interesting, and you've got me waiting
436 for the next installment, and wondering what will happen next.

447  iss seeing kathyd too, I guess I was not the only one who had a tough

473                A story for the TIN MAN  by kathyd
474     (i wrote this on the back of a placemat at fridays and gave the TINMAN the
475      orginal, so this is from memory, hope it improves with retelling)
476  
477 Murray the accountant was having a very murray day, such a happy man this murrayay
478 is.  The morning started as usual when Murray caught the 7:03 express into town
479 arriving promptly as usual at 7:40. Walking into his office at 7:45 he takes off
480 his hat and coat and gives them to his nude secretary Miss Smile(she has great
481 teeth). "Miss Smile, has Mr. Drake been in with the day's accounts?" Murray said
482 as usual. "Oh yes Murray, Paul has been in and out several times already today"
483 Miss Smile says with a slow grin. "Well Miss Smile, it's great to know your still
484 keeping on top of things." Murray then ordered his morning coffee and sat down
485 to review the accounts promptly at 8:00 as usual. The morning went by quickly as
486 clients came and left satisfied, as usual. The next thing Murray knew it was
487 1:00 pm, Murray stood and walked to his bookcase, as usual and turn to face the
488 room. To his right he grasped a well worn copy of "The Wild Kingdom" by Marlin
489 Perkins; the bookcase shuttered and moved as usual. Murray turned and entered
490 his secert rooms. With the help of Miss Smile Murray dons his Purple cape with
491 the mink collar, and as usual pulls on his red leather pants. It's Super Murray!!
492 Jumping into his 1969 Caddilac Couple Deville, Murray hits the streets, ason his
493 way to collect his "union" dues, as usual. So far as you can tell Murray is no
494 ordinary man, he spends a carefree afternoon collecting on debts, checking the
495 docks for "shipments" and has time left over to sit in with the boys in the
496 band for a number, as usual. It's 3:00 and time for Murray to get back to the
497 office, he drives in the secert entrance and Miss Smile is waiting there to 
498 help him change, as usual. On his way out the door, Murray gives Miss Smile
499 a wink and rushes down to catch the 3:50 home.(as usual)

502   A refreshing entry, as usual.  I shall cherish my original.  Perhaps I shall
503 try a poem in your honor.  It only took twenty-four years to write the first

515                            Remaking New Friends
516         Within the past few weeks or so I have been able to make quite a few
517 new friends.  They may not know that they have met me, but I have seen them
518 none the less.
519         I have always wondered just what some people looked like, how the
520 faces would match with the voices I have read.  In some cases the interest
521 was just to be able to make references by more than just words.  In other 
522 cases it was out of true wonder as to what kind of person was hiding behind
523 the words they have given us here and elsewhere.
524         To hide in the shadows as a couple of people introduced themselves
525 to another person, only mentioning pen names, it was truely interesting to
526 see how they reacted to one another.  The tip of the hat and the shaking of
527 the hands seemed warm and sincere.  Friends had finally met one another for
528 the first time.  Prehaps someday I shall step forth and say, "Hello, I'm

541       ONBOARD THE FLAG SHIP ATLANTA, TANIS WAS READING FOR THE ATTACK TO 
542 COME.ALL THE PILIOTS WERRE POSITIONED IN THEIR FIGHTERS AWAITING FOR THE
543 SIGNAL TO LAUNCH. A LIGHT ON THE FAR WALL FLASHED AND A ALARM WENT OFF. 
544 THS FIRST SHIP HAD BEN SIGHTED. THW POWERFUL FIGHTER ENGINES SCREAMED AS 
545 THEY PROPELLED TTHE SLEEK FIGHTING MACHINES DOWN THE LAUNCH TUBES.
546      "ACTIVATE DEFENCE SCREENS', SAID THE COMMANDER OF THE ATLANTA. THE 
547 AUTOMATIC ANTI-FIGHTER TURRETS ACTIVATED AND FIRED A FEW TEST SHOTS. THE 
548 DESTROYERS SPLIT UP AND STARTED TO ATTCAK FROM THREE DIFFERENT SIDES WHILE
549 THE WAVES OF FIGHTERS TOOK ON THE ENEMY SMALLER DEFENCS CRAFT. FOR THE
550 FEW FIGHTERS THAT BROKE THROUGH MET ALLMOST INSTANT DEATH  AS LASER 
551 CANNONS LASHED OUT AT THE FIGHTERS. 
552 	FORR HOURS THE SKYS WERE FILLED WITH VOILENT FIGHTING. LASERS AND
553 TORPEDOS FLYING INTO OTHER SHIPS AND THE CLEEN MHSSES GOING OFF INTO DEEP 
554 SPACE DETONATING AGAINST SOME DISTAND ROCK OR OTHER DEBREES. THE BATTTLE
555 WAS EVEN UNTILL THEIR BIGGEST CRUSIER FINALY BUCKLED UNDER AND EXPLODED, 
556 TAKING 5 SMALLER SHIPS WITH IT. 
557 	THE DOG FIGHT WAS CRULE AND INHUMAN, REQUIERING ALLMOST COMPUTER
558 REFLEXES THAT A HUMAN WAS ALL MOST NOT CAPBLE OF. 
559 	'TANIS, I HAVE ONE ON MY TAIL, I NEED HELP!", CRIED A WARRIOR.
560 	"I'M ON MY WAY, JUST HOLD ON A WHILE LONGER!" AS TANIS NEARED THE LONE 
561 FIGHTER HE SAW THE PURSING CRAFT DESTROY HIS FRIEND.
562      "NO1' AND ALL OF HIS CANNONS BELCHED ONE GREAT BLAST OF ENERGY AND 
563 SILENCED THE OTHER FIGHTER IN ONE SMALL BALL OF FIRE. JUST THEN ANOTHER
564 FIGHTER THAT HE HAD NOT SEEN IN HIS FURRY HAD CREAPED UP BEHIND HIM AND 
565 HIT HIS MAIN ENGINE. SMOKE FILLED THE CABON. THEN THERE WAS A BUMP
566 THAT COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING. HE WAS TRACTORED. HE COULD FEEL HIS CRIPLED
567 CRAFT BEING PULLED TOWARED A CARRIER. HE WAS CAPTURED.

571 sorry for the mixup. I appreciate the disks very much. I was considering
572 the whole deal to be a favor for a friend. But I will accept the disks with
573 a big 'MERCI!' Now for a favor (changes quick eh?) Could you bring the
574 Sanyo versions of the BASICA adventures again. I seem to have fouled the
575 files somehow. Also, I recommend voyeur as a fine beta tester for the Tandy
576 2000. He has had quite a bit of experience with terminal programs in another

617 after all this time i have finally finished all the excess and am now ready
618 to get down to business...  i can't believe how long it seems to have been
619 since the last time i have been able to even try and reach bwms!!!
620   anyway i was reading through the second issue of a new piece of computer 
621 literature and just saw some interesting articles that i thought somebody
622 else would like to see...
623 the information following comes from "computer power" vol. 1, no. 2 first 
624 quarter...
625   good news bad news section :
626 good news - hardware/software sales-persons have an answer for everything.
627 bad news - it's difficult to differentiate between salesmanship and sincere
628 concern.  good news - software manufacturers ofer simple and inexpensive
629 upgrades to users. bad news - you must send in registration card to qualify.
