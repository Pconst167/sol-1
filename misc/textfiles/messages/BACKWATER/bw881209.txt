 69 What, another of those bible based con artists is attempting to get cash
 70 by threatening suicide? Well if he doesn't get it, might I suggest having
 71 him drown in his own water theme park? It appeals to my sense of irony.
 72  
 73 In any case:
 74      Demons? Bring em on! I'm sure they'l just be popping in for a drink
 75 and a little conversation. I don't suspect it'd be very fun to be a
 76 demon, what with all the arch-gods ordering you around and making your 
 77 exhistence miserable, so cut 'em some slack. Besides, nobody really works
 78 this close to Yule that can get away with it, and they've probably spent
 79 a hard days work at the soul brokerage that has hired them. "Never take
 80 your job to an inn, 'cause it'll spoil your fun" is a well known proverb
 81 in almost all dimensions.

127      Rayall gasped his thanks as he     downed the flagon of foul spirits.
128 Then, tossing the cup with perfect      precision onto the hook from whence it
129 came, he studied his surroundings.
130      Despite the fact that he spotted   nothing of a decidedly demonic nature,
131 the bartender aside, he was still 
132 feeling quite uneasy.
133      His hands went immediately to the  warm familiarity of his leather pouch.
134 From it, he drew a curious object that  seemed to be made of a greenish metal.
135 Two cylinders were attached to the top,
136 and a small needle quivered across a    readout on the face of the machine.
137 An odd whistling, humming noise.  As
138 he moved the curious machine around in
139 the air, the two cylinders rose outward,
140 until they reached polar opposites,
141 sticking out to the east and west.
142      "Perhaps a class 5, or a free
143 floating full torso vaporous 
144 apparition.  Of course, it might be a   class 7...  One of these days I've got
145 to get this thing a full overhaul."     Cursing in an unknown language,he 
146 stuffed the meter back into the pouch.
147 "There's definitely some parapsychic
148 energy here... "
149      Mutterig to himself, Rayall drew   his staff and ran his fingers across
150 the edge.  Suddenly, there was a mild
151 "pop", and with a puff of pinkish smoke, a longsword took its place.  Rayall
152 swung it experimentally, regaining the
153 feel of his favorite weapon, Luckseeker II.
154      "Unfortunately, Arthur Vennnit     isn't here right now," he muttered to
155 himself.  "Follower would have been a   welcome addition to our struggle. 
156 After all, the Sword of Yar is known    far and wide for its unique ability to
157 disperse demons... when a nuclear
158 accelerator isn't available... "

187                    J.D.'s Place is takinga vacation
188  
189 On Saturday, December 10th I am going out of town for probably a week.
190 During that time there will be nobody here to supervise the operation of
191 the board. My main worry is that if there is a blackout and power is
192 restored to the system, the hard disk will go into a continuous loop
193 trying to initialize itself. If I am gone this could go on for days,
194 quite possibly damaging or destroying the disk. So I am shutting the
195 system down for that time, as I figure a short vacation for the board
196 is better than a permanent one.
197  
198 So at midnight on Friday I will be taking the system offline, and it will
199 probably be back up on Sunday the 18th, if not sooner. I am sorry I did
200 not give more notice but it just occured to me tonight that I couldn't
201 leave the board running. Not to worry, though, the place will definitely
202 be back up and open for business as usual by the 18th.
203   
204 Until then, take care,
205  
206                          J.D. Silverman

302 tonight.
303  
304 Hey about this li'll bit o' theory...I call it (Dramatic Pause)...The Big 
305 Mother Bar-BQ.  I figured it all out.  A star say about the size of ours or
306 bigger, will cycle through its life, go red giant and then collapse either 
307 looseing itself in the explosion our going black hole on us.  These are the 
308 failed attempts for the BMBBQ and will eventualy recycle.  It is the smaller
309 stars I'm concerned with...the ones that go white dwarf.  Now if you think
310 about it, these are essentualy carbon...dense hot carbon.  And of course if 
311 you take all this carbon, put it under that kind of pressure and heat you
312 get...('nother drammatic pause)...Diamonds realy big diamonds!!  Actualy a
313 realy big diamond about the size of our planet.  Unfortunatly the heat is so
314 much that the final product is simmilar to a big momma lump o' charcoal.
315 Now...the way I figure it.  A big mother cow (say the Holy Cow) dies up in 
316 divinity land, the gods figure time to have a Bar-BQ.  A big mother Bar-BQ 
317 (After all who want's a giant cow decaying in there front yard).  Soooo they
318 work out this universe thing for the charcoal, proably already had the grill
319 or sometthing like that.  Who knows where they get the lighter fluid from.
320 And then (Yet A 'Nother Drammatic Pause) The Big Mother Bar-BQ!!!

444 Actually, I have been slowly cleaning up the list. but it is a pain to edit,
445 so it is rather low on my priority list. but if you notice, there are
446 sme new users showing up on the lower numbers which happens because the
447 numbers have been freed.
448 Having the users active doesn't take up any more disk space. The user list
449 is a fixed length file, so it takes the same amount of space whether there
450 is one user or 999 users. The same is true of the data files. Everything
451 is fixed length. It makes the program a thousand times easier to write
452 and maintain, and I don't have to worry about system crashes because a 
453 disk filled up.

545 Dreamer, 
546     What history? Not much to it really, it started out as a private system 
547 to test modem hardware. I put it together from a bunch of junk box parts.
548 Patched the code to provide the BW signon prompt and called it a BBS.
549 The original system ran on one 5 inch single sided floppy with 1K of ram
550 and 8K or rom. There was no OS, only the ROM code. The machine itself was
551 designed in 1976 and the code it ran on was derived from a much earlier
552 system. For sometime there was a lot of talk about updating the machine,
553 and finally a couple of years ago three other programmers and I got together
554 to make it happen. The end result was BWMS II. This current version was 
555 written in Turbo Pascal 3.0 and there is a Beta test version floating around
556 that has been written in Turbo Pascal 5.0. This was done to fix a few bugs
557 and to open up the code space to allow future additions and enhancements.
558 As for the old BW I system, we gave it a wake last year and it is resting
559 peacfully in a well deserved retirement.

562    It wasn't much of a day, warm, little wind, bright sun with a few clouds.
563 Suddenly a youth running by startled his attention away from the book he was 
564 reading. He seemed to be in an awful hurry as he had jumped a fence from an 
565 ajoining parking lot and continued through just barely keeping his balance.
566    Just the a van pulled up in the other parking lot and a lady yelled out the 
567 window, "Stop him! He just stole an old lady's purse!"
568    A feeling welled up inside of him as he thought "That little shit!" He tore 
569 off after the youth across the block and towards the row of trees he'd seen him
570 duck around. "I'll bet he's hiding behind that last tree to swipe at me."
571    As he came to the last tree he threw his right arm in a vicious blow towards
572 the edge of the tree, striking air.
573    "Oh well," he thought as he raced on arund the building. He spotted him 
574 running further down the street towards the open market area. "If he gets in 
575 there I'll lose him for sure!" And with that bad news he pushed on faster.
576    "HOLD IT!" He screamed as he closed on the youth. With a fluid movement he
577 snaked his right arm around the youth's neck and grabbed the youth's wrist with
578 his left.
579    "Great, now what do I do with him?" he thought as he held him in place.
580    "Okay man, you got me, lighten up okay?" The youth was breathing heavily.
581    "Yeah sure," he thought, "So you can run off again?" He guided him into a 
582 nearby flower shop and had the desk lady call the police.
583     While they were waiting, they talked. The youth was babbling about how he
584 never really di this kind of thing but he needed the money bad. He couldn't
585 have been older than 17.
586     Eventually the police came and went on to the scene of the crime.
587  
588  
589  
590     This is a TRUE story. I apprehended the youth. I would like a responce
591 To these questions:
592   
593     Was it smart for me to have chased the kid? (He could have had a gun)
594  
595     Should I have let him go? (There was plenty of time for him to disappear
596            before the cops showed up)

661 have Christmas at this time of year, instead of anywhere else .  First of all,
662 the stores couldn't make as much mf they h{F
663 oops, something happened.  anyway, stores couldn't make money because they have
664 many other sales, and having an entire month of shopping seems to satisfy them.
665 Also, Somewhere back in the past, someone dicided to compete with the Jews and 
666 a Christian celebration at the same time of year so that those Christians would
667 not get bored.  They would've had it in the spring since everybody's pal Jesus 
668 born in early April, but, then Easter would be too close.  Another trivial bit 
669 history, do you know our calendar is four years behind.  I find this rather unf
670 because I could be in college if that were true, and I won't suffer silently.
671      Anyway, enjoy the Christmas season. I personally hope I get a new crystal 
672 because mine seems to have clouded over again.

854  
855      The young woman in the dark cloak opened the door to the Backwater Inn
856 quickly.  She was certainly glad to be out of the cold December night,
857 but as she stepped through the doorway, sxe wac shocked.  The Inn was 
858 crowded, as usual.  That much hadn't changed.  But, she hardly recognized
859 a single patron.  No, that wasn't true.  There were a few faces...
860 although she had never known their names and couldn't greet them.
861 0   0She quietly went over to the bar, telling herself it didn't matter,
862 things always change, and it was good to get out of the cold.
863      "Perhaps, nobody recognizes me either," she mumbled to herself,
864 becoming quite melancholy and self-pityinw.
865      "I do."
866      She looked up to find the Innkeeper smiling at her.  She couldn't
867 hide her suprise nor her happiness as she gave him a warm hug.
868      "Am I glad to see you!"  They both said.
869      He served her a cup of hot citer, and they chatted about old times.
870      "It's been along time," he told her, "you can't expect everyone to
871 still be here.  You went away on your own adventures for two years, and they
872 went on theirs."
873       "I know," she said meukly (once again self-pitying), "it's just that
874  
875 I always thought that only I was the only one to change.  I never expected 
876 everyone else to, too."
877      He fixed her a long look.  The Innkeeper wasn't able to see much due
878 to the e~ormus hood she was hiding in.
879      "I had forgotten how young you were."
880      "Well..."  She said trying to think of what to say to make herself 
881 sound older.  She was feeling younger and younger.  "I guess I'm being 
882 silly."
883    0 Shu looked around, realizing a few patrons whom she didn't recognize 
884 where casually listen to her conversation with the Innkeeper.  All at once
885 she she felt foolish and embaressed.  Foolish, for acting like a silly
886 girl and embaressed besausu she (a stranger to most present) was taking
887 up so much of the Innkeeper's time.  Others wanted his attention.
888      "Well," she said, standing up from her stool and pulling her hood
889 over so now she was completely absorbed in her cloak, 2it's good to see
890 you again, friend."
891      The Innkeeper nodded, but the young woman was gone.  Of course, he
892 knew her to well.  She had hoped to make a somewhat dramatic exit, but
893 he wasn't fooled.  She was hiding in one of the corners f dxe crowded
894 room.  Completely consumed in the shadows of her cloak.
895      He looked around, but couldn't find her.  Then he smiled.
