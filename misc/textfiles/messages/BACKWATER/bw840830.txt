139 Wow, I have never seen Backwater like this.  This sure is a change from the
140 every day routines.  It seems like the wave has arrived at backwater.  It
141 kinda runs in a circle, all these new users I mean.  Well, I can only hope
142 that it gets all fixed-up and everything working again.
143 Well, there's not much to say these days so I'll be seeing you all around
144 someplace.

147 Laissez-faire - Indeed, it a great pleasure to interchange ideas with someone
148    who sees beyond the obvious, and who expresses what they see in eloquent
149    terms. I especially enjoyed the example of wave and sunset as experiential
150    examples of perfection. Once I experienced both together; a moment that I
151    treasure as one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.
152    Erudition is fine, as far as it goes. At some point one needs to leave the
153    comfortable confines of the printed page and set out on a course to obtain
154    their own direct experience in these matters. My experience leads me to
155    believe that the state of perfection and the perception of that state are
156    both gifts, not something one acquires through their own efforts. Many of
157    the exercises that are billed as 'means to acquire perfection' are merely
158    methods to condition the person to accept the gift, if and when it does
159    come along. By the way, you seem to be extremely well read yourself.
160   
161 We are taught that the acquisition of knowledge is of prime importance. In 
162 fact we are advised to acquire any and all information that is available.
163 Now there are even games (trivial) to test our accomplishment in this area.
164 There are some questions few seem to ask. Does acquiring certain kinds of
165 knowledge limit the ability to perceive or learn other things? What is the
166 'Coin of the Realm', which one uses to pay for knowledge? Is it perhaps the
167 loss of innocence?
168   
169 There is another popular modern idea, that perhaps warrants some scrutiny. It
170 says that the way to understand something is to gather enough pieces, then
171 put them together to form the big picture. Certainly this techniques has
172 served well in certain scientific investigations. There are other equally
173 valid methods of understanding. For example, the idea of 'essential nature'.
174 In this process understanding comes through synthesis rather than division.
175 Perhaps they are two parts of the same process, and one part was lost in the
176 translation!

227 
228   GEE, I JUST WOKE UP AND I ALL OF A SUDDEN REALIZED THE BITTER TRUTH; I LOST A RISK GAME!
229 
230   AND IT WAS A PITIFULL LOSS! I HAD ONLY MEAGER STRONGHOLDS THAT DIDN'T EVEN HALFWAY MEASURE THE IMPERVIOUS STRENGTH OF MINE
231 ENEMIES. IKEPT ON FOR A WHILE, UNTIL OF COURSE BART GOT A WILD- EYED LOOK AND SCREAMED "NO MORE MR. NICE GUY!" AND COURTIOUSLY
232 HANDED ME THE VICTIM DICE.
233 
234   AND WHILE I WAS BEING BURIED, SOMEONE ASKED ABOUT SURRENDER ON ALEX'S TERMS. THE SXENE STILLED AND EVERYONE LOOKED TO MIG...
236   MIG CLAIMED MASOCHISM AND THUS ALEX STOLE SOUTH AMERICA RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM. THIS IS WHEN MIG STARTED A PSEUDO-ORANGE-
237 VILE-LIQUID EFFECT!
238 
239   ALEX JUST COULDN'T WIN. TIDES OF WAR TURNED IN MIG'S FAVOR AND FOR TWO HOURS THE FACE OF GOD'S GREEN EARTH WAS SHREDDED IN
240 THE BLOODY RIGHTS OF WAR.
241 
242   BUT ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK I AND MIG HAD TO BE GETTING TOWARDS, HOME, AND SLEEP. BUT THAT IS YET ANOTHER STORY. THE OUTCOME OF
243 THE GAME YOU ASK, TECHNICALLY IT WAS ALEX WHO WON BUT IT SIMPLY WAS A JOYLESS VICTORY. I THINK.
244 
245   I AM SORRY, ALEX, FOR BEHAVING MORE AND MORE MY AGE AS EVENING PROGRESSED. IN RETRO-THOUGHT I DON'T REALLY SUPPOSE I SHOULD
246 HAVE QUOTED KLINGONS...
247   BUT THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, I HAD A FUN TIME.

281 when you get a 6809EMP, you will be able to have full duplex. ( the 6809EMP
282 has provisions for this. It is accessed through ROM which is easy to incorp

297 voyeur:prometheus made a much better discription then I could. What happened in
298 essence was Alex/Bart killing Prometheus in wanton bloodlust.
299 Let me explane, Alex went for beer letting Bart take his place, Bart has nothing
300 resembling human compassion and tact. When the`board was 95% red, and`I was 
301 black, I was`offered a`ghavce to acfneng

307 
308 I'M AFRAID WE'LL HAVE TO TUNE IN NEXT TIME FOR THE REST OF THIS FASCINATING
309 STORY
311 
312 MY NAME IS NIETZSCHE AND I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU ALL FOR A LONG TIME.
313 I AM IMPRESSED WITH WHAT I HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SEE AND WITH WHAT I
314 SEE AS A HIGH LEVEL OF TOLERENCE FORBELEIFS.
315 
316 THIS IS NOT THE CASE EVERYWHERE, AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW. I AM WHAT MANY WOULD
317 CALL A RIGHT WING CONSERVATIVE, I KNOW THAT MY MOTHER AND FATHER ARE AFRAID
318 OF ME AND MY VEIWS. I HAVE BEEN BEATEN UP, LECTURED, CONSIDERED TO BE QUITE
319 LITERALLY CRAZY, AND MANY OTBECAUSE OF MY BELEIFS.
320 
321 THERE ARE A FEW HAVENS FOR SOME ONE IN MY POSITION TO DEBATE AND EXPRESS MY
322 VEIWS AND POLITICS. BACKWATER MS IS ONE OF THESE.
323 
324 NIETZCHE IS AN ALIAS (Q.V.) AND I DO MAINTAIN ANOTHER IDENTITY. I'M SURE
325 SOME OF YOU HAVE KNOWN THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. I AM NEVER EASILY MIST-
326 AKEN.
327 
328   THE REAL NEITZCHE ONCE REFERED TO THE PRICE OF KNOWLEDGE AS " PESSIMISM OF
329 SENSIBILITY " ANOTHER WRITER FOR A TELIVISION SERIES ONCE TERMED IT THIS WAY
330 " I'VE SEEN TOO MUCH TO EVER BE BRIGHT- EYED AND BUSHY- TAILED, AGAIN. "
331 
332   IT IS THEN, NOT RARE TO PONDER THE PRICE OF INTELLECT BUT WHEN MOST PEOPLE
333 DO PONDER IT, THERE IS ALWAYS AN ATTITUDE OF REGRET, OR REMORSE.
336   IF SAY A SMALL LATINO-AMERICAN COUNTRY RENEIGED ON IT'S LOAN; ONLY 33 % OF
337 THAT LOAN WOULD BE FROM AMERICAN BANKS THE REST WOULD BE EUROPES BANKING
338 CENTERS.
339   WHEN VENEZUELA RENEIGED ON ITS COMPARATIVELY SMALL LOAN; INT'L COMMITTEE
340 WAS FORMED WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL THE INTRESTED BANKS IN ORDER TO
341 ABSORB THE COST OF THE LOAN. THE OTHER MAJOR BORROWERS WERE VERY DEFINATELY
342 WATCHING FOR THE OUTCOME OF THIS AS WELL AS MOST OF THE PRESS.
343 
344   IT IS MY BELEIF THAT WHAT WAS ONCE AN ERA OF POSSIBLE ANARCHY TYPE- SOCIAL
345 COLLAPSE IS OVER WITH. OF COURSE IF TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW AN 8" ARCHIVES
346 DISK IS FOUND BENATH THE RUBBLE OF TWISTED STEEL BUILDINGS AND A CORPSE OR
347 TWO THEN I WILL HAVE BEEN A FOOL BUT I DON't THINK I WILL.

356 Mikey: Yes I am interested. I can't speak for the others. If the price is
357 $5 per disk and you supply the disk, then bring them to the next PCS get-
358 together. I will pay and put on my shylock robes to collect from the others
359 later. Thanks for ressurecting the 20MAY83 file.
360 I have been looking over some of these old files from years gone by. I must
361 retract a previous statement in part regarding BW then and now. The phosphor
362 letters seemed to flow in smooth recourse from the CRT to my eyes. It had
363 been so long since the touching words of the old timers had laid claim to
364 my attention. I can see why you remember the "old days" so fondly: The great
365 debates (remember artificial intelligence and electrical shocks from phones)
366 the great romances (remember Luke and Jody), and so many facinating
367 characters and situations. But I guess, evolution is inevitable, and BW is
368 simply following the normal course of nature.

374                 A joyless victory at best......The teeth marks in the rolling

380 say it was uttered frequently ! and with painful regularity. Never have 
381 so many men died at the hands of " Rollus Ineptitudeus "....and there wasn't 
382 even an empty bottle of the vile orange on the premise. L'homme, perchance did
383 you spill any on the board ?...on the dice ?....the cards ?....the men

390 but as is always the case .... the proper printer has not yet stayed in town
391 long enough. When one does...The call will go out !
392 By the way have you got anything to counteract the vile orange ?

397 were talking voltage surge here, and then the joy of watching my screen

L'HOMME: OK, WILL DO NOT SUR HOW TO HANDLE THE 20MAY83 FILE, SINCE
405 THE STANDARD STRUCTURE IS TO FILL THE 8" DISKS AS FULL AS I CAN,
406 THERE AIN'T NO ROOM. MAYBE I SHOULD PLOP IT ON HERE? OR, JUST PROVIDE
407 IT TO YOU ON A 8" DISK OF ITS OWN? (I DO HATE TO WASTE A PERFECTLY
408 GOOD DISK ON A SINGLE FILE THOUGH... 
409 BY THE WAY, THE PRICE FOR NOW IS STILL $4.00 SINCE I STILL HAVE SOME
410 OF AARON'S DISKS LEFT. SPEAKING OF WHICH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD HOLD HIS 
411 DISKS FOR RANSOM. SEEMS THERE HAS BEEN NO MONEY OUTPUT AS OF YET.

479 I JUST GOT A MPP 1000C MODEM AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST BBS'
480 THAT I HAVE CALLED
481 !#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!#!
482 So, are there any Pascal (Apple) modem programs out there? I
483 am having a hard time finding one that will work.  If you have
484 any books that would help me or tyhe software itself could you
485 leave names of them and where I can get them?  THanKS.
486 "The good ol' days", That is probably the most common words in
487 the english language.  Some day they will look back into the 
488 dutly ol forgotten floppy disks, stick then into these old
489 out-of-date computers and say, "These were the GOOD ol' days".
490 Maybe?  Maybe not.  These computers will be set in the BIG
491 warehouse in the sky, right next to the GREAT invention of
492 the Vacume tube.  What will be the "Talk of the day" then?
493 How about transportation in the future?  Music?  Clothes?
494 Styles?  Food?  Hairstyles?  world hunger?  Housing?  What will
495 it be like after our graves have been forgotten?  Who knows,
496 the person of the future that might be reading this might be on
497 another planet, Space Syation, under the see in a homing comunity
498 where people grow up, have children then pass on the family name.
499 Or, another race altogether different than ours is now.  Maybe they
500 only know what we look like from old history books.  Maybe one of
501 them is eating his dinner off of this disk because they don't
502 even know what it is.  Neat questions huh?  If BWMS residents
503 are looking for something to talk about this might be an interesting
504 topic to do it on.  I know I have had fun typing this in tonight.
505 What will becaome of the society that we live in today, will it only
506 live in history text books, stidied by future student who will still
507 say "Why do we have to read this old junk!".  And who also eat all of
508 the monday suprise that we never ate.  
509 The "high tech" that are known today will be on display in the local
510 museum of ancient history.  They only look at them and wonder what
511 they did, and why we invented them or why we used them.  Only a few
512 would still work, being tested against all of the newer machines and
513 loosing horibly.  They will wonder how we could stand for such slow'
514 and meaningless tools as they look at thier own and say "Now there is
515 a MACHINE!".  Machines that we can only dream about today.
516 
517 Ok, there is a start on a different subject.  I'll stop now, not because
518 my fingures are tired but I don't HOG the topic.  Hope to see some replys.
519 And don't forgett about that Pascal QUestion at the top.

524 be Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Mahler---

526 YOU FORGET THAT THE BEATLES WILL STILL LIVE, THEM AND THE 'STONES
527 +++++++++++00000001TED++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
528 AH, YES, THE BEATLES. WHERE WERE YOU IN THE FALL OF 1963, WHEN THEY MADE TEIR
529 DEBUT ON ED SULLIVAN? 
530 There was this guy who wanted to build a backyard BBQ. He went down to Anaheim
531 Builders Supply, and got bricks, mortar, etc, and started building it. As 
532 he was almost finished, he realized that he was one brick short. He went back
533 to get it, but the salesman told him they only sold bricks by twos. (computer
534 ized inventory, etc). Well, the guy didn't like thi very much, but he ante 
535 wanted to get it done, so he bought two. After he hd completed the BBQ, he 
536 started to really get steamed up. So he went back to Anaheim Builders Supply
537 and demanded a refund. NO said the salesman. "So what am I supposed to do 
538 with this brick?" asked the guy? "I don't care" said the salesman. Well, they
539 argued for a while, and then the salesman said "Why don't you (DELETED). The
540 guy didn't want to do that with the brick(!), so he just threw it (the brick)
541 up in the air. And that's the end of the joke.
542 Okay, Guys; I now can claim lower case. Somehow sixteen straight hours of debug in a language I don't even have more than bare
543 association with doesn't seem worth it...
544 
545 Oh yesI must ask that you tolerate me, and what I'm sure will be oodles of errors 'til i get this terminal perfected. Please?
546 
547 Man In Grey; I did it, and I'm proud!
548 Alex; What can i further do?
549 
550 WELL, ERRORS IS CORRECT; DELUGE TERMINAL PROGRAM DISINTEGRATED HERE. I'LL FIX, AND SEE YOU LATER IN LIVES... PROMETHEUS(!)
551 
552 Uh, er excuse me but this is simply Prometheus again, trying Deluge terminal again. Thank you, Mikey for 'xt'. Sd8408.28

554 What?! You mean my poor old tube amplifiers are obsolete?
555 Golly, what ever shall I do? I think I'll just keep them,
556 they work perfectly well, and sound good too. Besides, they
557 hav sentimental value as I designed and built them myself.
558 (I guess that dates me huh?) I do have a transsistorised amp
559 as well, the tube amps are my backup units that I use when
560 something goes wrong with the transsistor amps. Currently
561 the transistor amp is sitting in a corner with a blown driver
562 transistor (40410) The only thing about the tube amp that
563 is not as good as the transistor amp is that it isn't as
564 powerful. But, since the tube amps have all the power I need,
565 that isn't really a problem. My quad system sounds just fine 
566 them thank you. 
567 *********************** CISTOP MIKEY ***********************
568 Mikey! You remember tubes? I remember tubes. 6L6's in push pull parallel. Dc on 
569 the filaments. Hum anyway. Humungous power transforers, ultra linear output
570 transformers---. Solid state notwithstanding, them as good old days.
571 **************************************************************
572 REMEBER THEM? I WAS WEENED ON TUBES.  AT THE TIME,TRANSISTORS WERE
573 JUST INTERESTING PLAY TOYES. ALL SERIOUS DESIGN WORK WAS STILL
574 BEING DONE WITH TUBES. AS A RESULT, IT TOOK ME UNTIL 1970 BEFORE I
575 REALLY UNDERSTOOD TRANSISTORS. ODDLY, IT WAS AN UNDERSTANDING OF TTL
576 LOGIC THAT BROKE THRU THE BARIER, ONCE I FINALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS
577 REALLY HAPPENING INSIDE THE BEASTS, I THEN UNDERSTOOD HOW THE TRANSISTOR
578 REALLY WORKED. UNFORTUNALY, NOW I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTEN HOW TUBES WORK!
579 LETS SEE, ARE THEY PNP OR NPN.....
580 ********************* CISTOP MIKEY ******************************
581 I'll try again.. Hello Pam? Are you out there?
582 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
583 MY FATHER HAS A TUBE AMP THAT WORKS PERFECTLY WELL, AFTER I FIX WHAT I BROKE ON 
584 IT. HEY MIKE, IF YOU READ THIS, CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT USUALLY CAUSES A CRACKLING 
585 NOISE IN A TUBE AMP? ONE THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN AMPLIFIED ARC LIGHT. (GADS) 
586 (I TESTED ALL TUBES AND THEY WORK PERFECTLY) I LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT TUBES BEC
587 AUSE OF MY OWN CURIOSITY. THE DESIGNS THAT I JUST LOVE TO FIX ARE THE HYBRID MIX
588 ES OF TUBES AND TRANSISTORS. A MESS. I ALSO HAVE A 25 YEAR OLD B/W TV THAT IS EN
589 TIRELY TUBES. I REGULARLY GIVE IT INFUSIONS OF PARTS, TUBES AND ONCE EVEN A SCRA
590 P TUNER THAT COULD BE CONNECTED TO A UHF TUNER. THAT TV HAS TAKED QUITE A BEATIN
591 OVER THE YEARS AND I WONDER IF IT WILL OUTLAST ME.  NO ONE SHOULD FORGET TUBES, 
592 AFTER ALL, YOU ARE PROBABLY STARING INTO ONE.
