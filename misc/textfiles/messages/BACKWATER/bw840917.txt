20 WOW!!!! at the top, this hasn't happened to me for months &  months.
21 Question????? When will all you Vic, 64, Apple users learn to use
22 full lines on this system????? Just because your screen only displays
23 23,40,64 lines doesn't mean that this system won't accept more!!!!
24 You can set these margins up to 128 characters per line but 76 is prefered.
25 Personally I like 80 with my 64 as two screen lines equal one Backwater
26 line, but if I'm using an 80 column terminal its even easier.

54 Forgot to ask about non-sequential risk...more details please.

56 MiG,
57 The file does not contain much material......but fear not there are
58 some odd multiples and regular repetitions Sooooo there is still hope. I 
59 still think its some format garbage that contains ( if any ) a small amount
60 of data....Friday it is.......more info then.

62 L'homme,
63 Perhaps you should notify the research firm of your choice as to the 
64 effects that VOL seems to perpetrate on this reality.... After all it was 
65 you who brought the first batch..... or you could start the Center for the 
66 Study of VOL....or The VOL Center for Abberation Research....hey even
67 A.A. ... Anomlies Anonymous.....
68 Hmmm you might even get some pagan organization to sponsor the research

78 Once again I continue to learn. Yes the first Apples were nasty little things.
79 I knew somebody that had bought what was then a Heathkit pc, and he was quite
80 adamant about the fact that Apples power supply was no good and he said*
81 "I wouldn't buy an Apple now or in the future, because they have none." He
82 was always a great seer don't you think? Ideally an Apple IIc is what i'd
83 like to put my mitts on, however that $1300 price tag tends to make me a bit
84 purchase shy. I considered an Atari 600 or 800 but that basicly the same
85 price range: too high. So I guess it's settle for a Coomode or a Trash. Ahh
86 if life just didn't have all these little decisions to make! How boring it
87 would all be! Well, beings as it's time to hang up the modem and acall it a
88 day I will. It's a day!

96             By noise immunity I meant the 6502 doesn't seem to be quite as
97 touchy about dirty data and address lines as the others I've worked with.
98 Also MiG (I think) asked me earlier why I thought the 6502 is used still.
99 I'd speculate that it is because the 6502 was relatively cheaper earlier
100 then most of the others. As a result there's a lot of inertia and a very
101 broad user base. Would you care to comment? (Your comments are giving me
102 some good historical material)

138        As for RISK, I was involved in a game of BBS risk about 6 months
139        ago (on another network, as they say) and it was really quite
140        interesting.  We might give it a try here, as the riskers also
141        seem to be hardcore users of the system.  If we play, I claim 
142        black.  I also volunteer to be the game sleeper.
143 
144 Mikey - Would a risk game be OK with you ?  It doesn't take much space
145         as abb. are used.  Let us know.
146 
147 Riskers - If Mikey says OK, I will leave the rules.
148 
149 Mikey - As boss man, how do you feel about the N.A.P.P. ?  Are you favorably
150         inclined ?  Is the date OK ?
151 
152 All - Regarding previous meg.  'cute', but unnecessary.
153       I guess from vandalism, there is not the necessary interest.  I will

209 Mikey: I've been scanning my archive copies, and I have a question:
210 what do you do with control characters?  I have noticed that a lot of 
211 them disappear when you move a disk to drive B, and I couldn't find any
212 (for instance) tabs in the archives.  So, what is translated into what,
213 and what can I expect to find in the archives?  (It would be handy to know
214 so if I decide to print them out, I'll be able to filter out any characters
215 that my printer doesn't like).Thanks.

227   Noticing that the reality of the inn was dimming somewhat the piper stood
228 and called to those around--
229 "Please ... remember that the reality of where we interact is a consentual
230 decision.  Our image of the inn is dependent upon repeated repainting of te
231 images -- we need to keep the scene fresh in everyone's imagination.  After 
232 a short time, the image begans to get rather thin and fly-specked.  We have
233 numerous new people here who have to be shown this reality so that they may
234 intensify rather than dilute it.  I am as guilty of anyone for neglecting 
235 the atmosphere, but please let's keep the inn in sharper focus!"
236   The piper looked slowly about the large plank-floored room, his gaze tra-
237 velling across the ancient scarred wooden counter being polished by the
238 innkeeper, lingering a moment on the worn surfaces of groups of tables pushed
239 together by the patrons deep in discussion and debate, past the smoky fire that
240 filled the air with wisps and eddys of fragrance, up a short flight of stone
241 steps past the half-ajar door to the rowan tree planted there -- it seemed 
242 like ages ago!-- by the by now nearly mythical Pam.

274 played Columbia HS is a basketball game. Some clever person at our school
275 really had his or her little mind working, so before the game, several signs
276 were made up. The faculty didn't realize until it was too late what exactly
277 the signs really meant. They were displayed for all to see - and what did
278 they say?  "DAVID DOUGLASS IS GOING TO SMOKE COLUMBIA"
279 Clever eh?
280 Laz : I don't want to speak for Alex, but we who attend his Risk parties and
281 partake of VOL don't care too much for the sequential form of risk as found
282 previously on CBBS/NW. You may be able to start another game here, but I
283 imagine some might object to the space it takes considering the limited #
284 of lines per disk. Maybe another game on CBBS/NW again. Bill Marx doesn't
285 have to play (and cheat? haha) every game you know...

400 
401 I would like to reiterate again,(the glitch got me!) that I appreciate the quality of writers on this BBS. It is always

406 ::::::::::::14Sept84:::::O O:::::::::::::::::::::O O::::::::::05:16::::::::
407 voyeur strolled down the path toward his destination.  As he neared, he began
408 to spot more frequent signs of the recent visitors - damaged trees and bushes,
409 garbage strewn along the way.  He picked up what he could, but soon his pack
410 was full and he could hold no more.  Sighing, he wished that he could get the
411 rest of the Innhabitants to help clean up, but alas, they were such an 
412 independant lot that whatever got done was done individually.
413 As he came to the bridge, he eyed it dubiously.  It looked a bit rickety and
414 in ill-repair, but upon closer inspection he decided that the basic foundation
415 was still sound; the damage was mostly cosmetic, and with some attention it
416 would regain it's former appearance of solidity.  Proceeding across the span and
417 along the path, he began to smell the familiar aroma of woodsmoke in the air.
418 He was getting close!  Rounding a bend, he saw it - the well-seasoned logs of 
419 it's sides, the steep gabled roof, the rowan tree - the Inn.  After being off 
420 travelling since the ill-fated Amber adventure, it was good to be back.
421 Approaching the door, he noticed that the Inn itself had not escaped the
422 ravages of the childish and inconsiderate visitors.  Graffiti was carved into
423 the wall, such trash as 'SLIME PIT MINDS RULE THE UNIVERSE'.  Saddened at
424 the desecration, he was almost afraid to see what had transpired in the
425 interior.  Firming his resolve, he entered...
426 As he stood in the doorway, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the relative 
427 dimness, he was relieved to note that the current patrons did not seem to be
428 too rowdy a group.  Finally able to see properly, he looked around the common
429 room.  There along one side was the bar, with the Innkeeper disconsolately 
430 wiping the counter.  Along another wall was the large fireplace, which at
431 present was banked and merely smoldering.  Off to one side was the stairway
432 heading to the sleeping rooms upstairs.  Around the rest of the room were
433 scattered tables, at which were seated the present occupants.  Some were
434 familiar, some not.  He saw the piper off in his usual corner, carving a new
435 drone reed.  He waved at the piper, getting a smile and a nod in return.
436 Deciding to dampen his throat before getting into any serious story telling,
437 he strode to the bar and asked for a beer.  While waiting for his drink, he
438 asked the inkeeper what had become of his barmaid.  'I wish I knew,' the 
439 inkeeper responded so wistfully that voyeur forbore from furthur inquiry.
440 Turning around, he scanned the seated customers, looking for the old familiar
441 faces.  Where should he start?  Was Milchar here perhaps?  He was curious to hear
442 the rest of the story of the Ruby Valley.
443 ::::::::::::::::::::::::O O:::::::::::voyeur::::::::::O O:::::::::::::::::
444 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
445    The piper was shaving a small sliver off the toungue of a new drone reed
446 when the scarred wooden door opened.  Squinting against the brightness, he 
447 smiled at what seemed to be a familiar figure making his way across the room to
448 the bar.  It was voyeur -- back from his last adventure!  
449    The piper scraped just a touch from the short length of cane, then wrapped
450 a bridle of rosined hemp cord around the toungue of the drone reed.  Placing it
451 to his mouth, he blew a short tone.  Somehow it seemed that the room wavered
452 slightly with the intensity of the sound.
453   He quickly slid the bass drone from its stock in the bag, removed the old
454 reed, inserted the new and reassembled the pipes.  Placing them on his shoulder,
455 the piper winded the pipes and gave a tap to the inflated bag.  The reed caught
456 quickly, did not roar or double tone.  Holding the pressure steady in the bag,
457 he began sliding the joints of the drone until the reed came into tune.  A few
458 touches to the tenor drones, and the pipes began to give the air a shimmering
459 somewhat like the air rising over a hot stove.  Running quickly up and down
460 the scales to test the tuning, the piper, satisfied began to play the 
461 piobarechead "Lament for the Children."  Tears were soon streaming down his 
462 bearded face as the music took control of his emotions -- this song was written
463 by a piper to express extreme grief, the ground, or basic tune, was taken from
464 the sounds of his wife's heartbroken sobbing after the death of seven children
465 from the plague.

475 Someone was killing a cat! That was the only thing he could
476 think of could make such a garrish racket. His sleep now ruined,
477 he sprang from his tattered bed, and made his way sleepily to the
478 door. Upon opening the worn wooden door that separated his crude
479 room from the rest of the inn, the sound grew both in magnitude and
480 pitch. Since he could do nothing else, he listened closer, hugging to
481 relative safety of the outer hall's railing. The sound seemed to to
482 delve into his very soul. Never before had he had such feelings. Feelings
483 he could obviously not explain. He quickly realized this was more than
484 the death cries of some unfortunate feline. The sound seemed to almost
485 carry him down the hallway. As he approached to stairs that lead to the
486 commons, the sound grew in strength and clarity. He could almost make out weeping
487 sounds hidden in the subtle phrases of what he now knew was some new
488 kind of music. At the top of the stairs, he forced himself to stop his
489 forward motion. Would it be safe to be seen by the other patrons? He had
490 taken so much care to hide his face and enter the inn without too many
491 taking notice. Now would this music force him to ruin all of his secretive
492 plans? He wanted to remain at the top of the stairs, just out of sight, but
493 not too far away to not hear and experience the music.
494 Suddenly it stopped, and the gathering quite took him so by surprise, he
495 lost his balance, and tumbled down the stairs. Years of training helped his
496 reflexes to control his body and minimize his injury, but the end result was
497 a none-too-gracious introduction to the crowd who had gathered to experience
498 the music in their own way too. The noise he made upon hitting the landing was
499 enough to wake even the most groggy inn goer, but most of the patrons'
500 attention was still focused on the source of the music. He noticed a few smiles
501 aimed in his direction as he righted himself, but no laughter or chidding, as he
502 feared. Quickly regaining some composure, he followed the paths of the other's
503 eyes to the source of the wonderful music. His eyes set upon a colorful man
504 beyond description, and an amazing set of pipe-like instruments. His curiosity soon
505 overpowered his usually steady caution center, and he forgot all about the
506 troubles that had brought him here to the inn.

518 awright! This ridiculous computer warfare has gone on long enough!  What a
519 bunch of idgets!  I have worked on all of the afore mentioned machines,
520 both business and game programming.  Each machine has its own strong points,
521 though some have very, very weak points indeed.  I currently have a 'crapadore'
522 and find it the most fun and versatile as far as games go.  The apples, 
523 franklins, IBMs, etc, are all of the highest quality.  The only computer that
524 I may scoff at may be the TI line.  Not exactly what I term a 'computer'.
525   So beore you go calling anybody names, look at your own hunk-a-junk and see
526 if you can be proud of it or not.

532 "Well played indeed, old friend!" cried the bard as he entered, book in hand.
533 "I think I shall refrain from singing for the moment, otherwise we may find
534 ourselves in one of those 'my song's gloomier than your song' competitions! I 
535 still shudder at the memory of one such contest that STARTED with 'Sam Hall'..."
536 He then seated himself at a table near the entrance to the 'baths'. 
537 Many had commented on the strangeness of Roman-style baths in an Inn such as
538 this, but there was a simple enough explanation. The Inn had been built on and
539 around the remains of the old baths. Since the ground was already clear & a 
540 foundation in place building had been easier. Though bard suspected that the 
541 builder had also liked the idea of having the baths there!
542 There was a lull in the conversation & bard spoke up. "I fear I cannot
543 remember if I have sung a song called 'Causes of Rebellion' to this fine company
544 if I have then you may be interested to know that the tune is also used for
545 a song called 'Retreat Along the Wabash'."
