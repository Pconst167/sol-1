34 The Poet, starting out confused, found the confusion of landing less of a 
35 jolt than most of his companions. At first, he merely stared blankly over 
36 the gunwales at the rolling brown hills among which their boat had been
37 deposited, but he soon found his attention drawn to the edifice about 1/4 
38 mile up the nearest rise. A Henge! What was a Henge doing in a 20C Noram
39 time line? It wasn't quite properly aligned, nor was it made from the pure
40 bones of the earth. Nonetheless there was a powerful enchantment on it,
41 something to do with the sacrifice of thousands of young men. A human
42 sacrifice of hideous proportions, but not here, and not evil in the main.
43 These things confused the already foggy Poet, but something flickered at the
44 edges of his consciousness. What...Of course! This was a thin spot, a place
45 where the reality of the Inn might be within reach. A sudden need to taste 
46 a drink without fear of hangover overcame the usually conservative Poet's
47 tendency to let others clear his path, and he began his Transfer Major 
48 meditation, sinking cross legged to the deck and drawing forth his Spirit
49 pouch. After a few moments, a blazing blue glow enveloped him, and he 
50 vanished.
51 A low rumble as of thunder sounded from the Henge on the hill.
52               && The Mad Actor &&
53 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
54   The piper saw his companions leaping off the craft and converging upon the
55 henge.  Several performed rituals of one sort or another, faded out and changed
56 realities.  After the rumble as The Mad Actor changed realities faded, the 
57 piper began to feel rather lonely.
58   Ahh there was the one who could never add up evenly -- or was it odd?  Never
59 mind, it looks like someone got some knowlege from this trip, after all.
60   "Over here!" he shouted.  When the Man Without Parity arrived, the piper 
61 offered the use of his sporran to carry the harvest of 3x5 cards.  
62   The main rush had subsided.  The piper, feeling somewhat responsible for
63 the party thought # have we missed anyone? #
64   The reply was faint, but there. #ALL YOUR PARTY IS WITH YOU OR ALREADY PASSED
65 FROM THIS REALITY #
66   The piper, hoping that the new bass reed was properly broken in raised his
67 pipes to his shoulder.  Inflate the bag.  A slight tap to start the drones.
68 Pressure up slightly to get past the double tone on that tenor drone, then
69 down to keep the life longer on the reeds.  A quick touch on one tenor to 
70 pull out a quaver in the sound -- there.
71   The piper began playing "The Green Hills of Tyrol" and the remaining members
72 of the party faded from the brown hills of Washington, leaving the river bank
73 covered with footsteps and the broken hull of their abandoned watercraft.
74 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

76    As soon as the craft had touched terra firma, the ancient alchemist
77 leaped to the ground. Having a sea going vessel take flight had taken his
78 breath away to say the least. Turning to comment on this to his friend the
79 piper, he suddenly became aware of the Golden symbol, which now circled
80 the neck of that 'master of the musical bag'. No comment was necessary
81 other than a small nod of the head. It had become apparent that the piper
82 was well aware of the import of such a manifestation. Symbol of the great
83 "O" had been well placed.
84  
85    A short walk brought the ancient practitioner to the key spot in the
86 great henge. This symbol of times past and all it repesented stirred
87 something inside the alchemist. Suddenly he remembered many of those 
88 things which had been placed in the far reaches of his mind. Looking down
89 the long trail of memories a few things were suddenly much clearer, some
90 much too clear. Since he had arrived in this trans-reality there had been
91 an on-going debate about the relative merits of the material vs. the
92 mystical aspects of being. Why, he had even got caught up in the ebb and
93 flow, as the two factions maneuvered for position. (My, My, what would
94 his guide of old think of such a lapse?) How could he have forgotten,
95 even for a moment, that they were merely two aspects of the same thing?
96 Indeed, the primary aspect of the 'Magnum Opus' was to create a blending
97 of the two through the transmutation process.
98   ##WELL LITTLE MORTAL, SLIPPED AND FELL IN THE MUD AGAIN I SEE!##
99 When the ringing in his ears had subsided somewhat he turned and walked
100 slowly back toward the others. As he approached the group he mused to
101 himself and chuckled. Even in this era the two were beginning to merge.
102 As one listened to the 'Quantum Physicists' speak of particle detection
103 and how the existence of the building blocks of material reality are
104 dependent upon the action of the observer; they begin to sound like the
105 ancient mystical teachings. 
106   
107    Sensing that he was already overdue for a rendevous with his friends
108 in another trans-reality, the alchemist pulled the multi-phase transmuter
109 from his tunic and passed his hand across its face. Slowly he began to
110 become less substantial until he was a mere whisp of fog on the light
111 breeze. Then nothing!

113  
114 The wino observed the boat that was deposited nearby by a green monster.
115 Rubbing his eyes, he looked again, but it did not go away. Then a number
116 of people began to clamber out of the boat and run towards the monument
117 nearby. After they had all assembled at the monument, one of them started
118 to play some bag pipes. After only a moment they all disappered. Looking
119 at the half emptied bottle in his hand, then back to the monument several
120 times, the wino looked quite disturbed. Finally he seemed to come to a
121 decision, and throwing the bottle to the ground, he quickly ran from the 
122 area.

124 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
125 WHEW!........FINALLY A FEW MOMENTS TO RESPOND. I HOPE YOU HAD NOT GIVEN
126 UP ON ME AARON!
127 FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE ANTAGONISTIC SORTS, AND SUGGEST
128 THAT YOU DROP DOWN ABOUT 30 OR SO LINES.........THIS IS GOING TO BE ABOUT
129 YOU KNOW WHAT.
130 
131 OKAY..........WHERE DO I START.......FIRST OF ALL MANY PASSAGES IN THE
132 SCRIPTURES INDICATE THAT THE ONLY ONES ABLE TO DISCERN HIS COMING OR
133 PRESENCE WOULD BE HIS TRUE FOLLOWERS. (Not Christians in general)
134 FOR INSTANCE ACTS 1: 9 AND 11, EXPLAINS THAT HE WAS TAKEN UP FROM
135 THEIR VISION AND WOULD RETURN LIKEWISE. ONLY THE APOSTLES WERE PRESENT,
136 NOT ALL OF THE CLAIMED CHRISTIANS AT THAT TIME. ALSO HEBREWS 9:28 STATES,
137 ".....AND THE SECOND TIME HE APPEARS IT WILL BE APART FROM SIN AND TO
138 THOSE EARNESTLY LOOKING FOR HIM FOR THEIR SALVATION."  
139 IN ANOTHER REFERENCE, REVELATION 1:7, IT SAYS, "LOOK! HE IS COMING WITH
140 THE CLOUDS, AND EVERY EYE WILL SEE HIM, AND THOSE WHO PIERCED HIM.."
141 THIS PASSAGE COULD NOT BE LITERAL. IT WAS AFTER ALL A VISION, VERSE 1
142 SAME CHAPTER SAYS THE WHOLE BOOK IS SIGNS AND PORTENTS. ALSO THE BIBLE
143 CLEARLY STATES THE THE DEAD ARE DEAD. UNCONSCIOUS, UNABLE TO THINK. SEE
144 ECCLESIASTES 9:5, 10, ALSO PSALMS 146:4, AND JOHN 11:1-14. THE LATTER
145 SHOWS THAT JESUS EVEN COMPARED DEATH TO SLEEP, AN UNCONSCIOUS STATE.
146 THEREFORE THIS SCRIPTURE IN REVELATION 1:7, THAT SAYS EVEN THOSE WHO
147 PIERCED HIM WOULD SEE HIM, CANNOT POSSIBLY LITERAL, FOR THEY DIED
148 CENTURIES AGO. ALSO A DISCUSSION ON THE GREEK WORD "PAROUSIA" IS IM-
149 PORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING THIS........BUT I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO FINISH
150 THIS AT THIS POINT.....SO LOOK FOR MORE LATER. SORRY IT HAS TAKEN ME
151 THIS LONG TO EVEN PARTIALLY REPLY.
152 ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?DEBORAH?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??

176 TO: THE MASTER
177 
178      So I see that your Chamelion Circut is still working!!!  Disguising 
179 yourself as a BBS must require a lot of energy!!!
180 
181      I still want to get even for your pushing me off that radio tower in
182 "Logopolis".  It's hard to believe that you actually survived our recent 
183 encounter in "The Five Doctors".
184 
185      By the way, who is 'The Ninja'?

187 
188                            The REAL AND ONLY Doctor
189 
190 ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
191 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
192      It has been over a year since the great upheaval destroyed 
193 my home. I can't be too sure of the time, since I have nothing to 
194 keep track of it by, I can only go by the passing of the seasons. 
195 The time was most distressing for me. When the great upheaval 
196 destroyed my homeland, the sea came rushing in to cover the 
197 reminants that were left. How I managed to survive, I'll never 
198 know. Yet somehow thru shear will power I have managed. Awash in 
199 the ragging sea, I grabbed at what debries there was that floated 
200 close at hand. Slowly as the days passed I built a raft from the 
201 wreckage that was left. I was alone in the ragging sea now. My 
202 friends and family left behind beneath the furious waves of the 
203 disaster. As the days passed, I searched for a new land in which 
204 to start anew. Yet always when I thought I had found land at last 
205 it turns out to be but another piece of floatsome or a barren sea 
206 washed reef. Nothing that could even offer as much as the raft I 
207 had built. Living off the offerings of this storm filled water, I 
208 find myself growing ever weak and frail. I must find stable 
209 ground and comfort. If only I could actually be warm for even a 
210 little while...  Then it had finally happened, during the middle 
211 of the night while I slept the raft had run aground upon an 
212 island. A solid mountain amidst the waves. It seemed to be fairly 
213 recent, as bits of sea plants and animals still lay about in 
214 various forms of decay. Draging the raft a bit higher, I had 
215 decided to explore this island further in the morning. Morning 
216 came late, and what light there was had filtered thru very heavy 
217 storm clouds. Worry crossed my face as I looked about. It would 
218 not be good to be caught aground if this storm breaks loose. Then 
219 I looked about for the first time, and to my amazment there 
220 pearched upon the highest part of the island was a house! It was 
221 surounded by a heavy wall to keep out the stormy seas inside this 
222 was a sturdy fence, though why this was needed I failed to see. 
223 The windows were shuttered fast so as to not let the storm enter 
224 this lonly abode. Standing before this wonder, I feel many things 
225 coming from this place. Fear and sorrow do I notice first, and 
226 yes, concern too. Yet overriding it all is concern and a power of 
227 will the like of which I have not known. As the storm approches, I
228 make my decision, and leaping over the fence with its tightly 
229 fastened gate I approach the front door and tentitivly grasping 
230 the ornate knocker with a shaking hand, I raise it to strike. 
231 Worry crosses my face. Will I be rejected to face the storm on my 
232 own once more? Or will I finaly find an end to this drifting 
233 carried to who knows where by the stormy seas? Not being able to 
234 stand any longer, I bring the knocker down striking the plate 
235 three times. As the sound reverberates thru the house, I drop my 
236 arm to my side and I turn to sit down on the front step, for my 
237 weak legs could no longer hold my body errect. As my eyes moved 
238 across the doorway, I saw a small box attached to the wall beside 
239 the door with the ledgend 'PAM' emplaced upon it. I only hope 
240 that this PAM will not turn me away, I truly need shelter and a 
241 friend to talk to, it has been so long... As I sink down to sit 
242 down on the front step, I hear movment within the house. I can 
243 only hope... Could it only be the chill wind that causes me to shiver?
244 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Elger EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

452   Waiting outside the inn, the piper watched his friends file in the open 
453 door.  A roar of laughter escaped as the door closed.  He stood for a moment
454 beside the rowan tree, then picked a spray of leaves from it and fastened them
455 to the lapel of his blouse.  Turning from the temptation of the inn, the piper
456 began a long walk to a destination he knew was still waiting.  Glancing back
457 over his shoulder, he hesitated.  No, the journey must be mad, and with slowly
458 increasing resolution, his steps moved away.

531      LATER I HEARD HIM POUNDING ON THE FRONT DOOR, THE SOUND ECHOING
532 THROUGH A VERY MYSTICAL FRONT HALLWAY.  SURE ENOUGH, THERE HE WAS, 
533 TOO WEAK TO STAND, WORRY CROSSING AND RECROSSING HIS FACE.  I WATCHED 
534 THE WORRY CROSS HIS FACE AT LEAST FOUR TIMES.  MAYBE IF I AM REAL 
535 QUIET HE'LL GO AWAY.  OPPS, I THINK HE HEARD ME.
536      "PAM!  GET UP HERE.  NOW!"

609 printing!  Something besides pure bullony. All right!! WAY TO GO!!
610 
611      Well I see that Pam didn't leave any answer to my questions on Drive a.
612      Which just goes to support my theory that she doesn't know what she's
613 talking about (like most of the user's of this system).
614       
615 I wonder if my MSD POWER SYTSTEM bill board will get this kind of user's
616 when it goes on line this week?  I pray that it doesn't. 
617  
618      Oh well, I guess that is what happens when people don't know what 
619 reality is or where to find it.

621      To Mike Day;
622         What kind of mind do you have?
623       
624      To let this kind of bill boarding go on (ex. sinbad stories, LSD trips
625 on Pam, Ninja trips and the like. If Pam is the whole world to you or whoever,
626 why doesn't she ever talk to you directly instead of these stories of who knows
627 what???) would be a blow to anyone having any knowledge of computing.
