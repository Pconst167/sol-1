45 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (no one is reading...)
46 so I'll say that a foul wind is blowing- foul from non-recognition...
47 ^^^^^                              ('Glasses and Hammers)
48 As I watched the sands drop, I had not noticed the face of the man carrying the
49 Hourglass.  If I were to have tryed, I might have noticed that his face was
50 draped with a cowl that drew waving lines to his shouders.  These lines seemed
51 to be stopped strands of time themselves- coarse khaki lines that draped past
52 his shoulders and continued to the floor.
53      The pace of the sands decent had quickened in what seemed another minute.
54 Before all of what had taken place before me became clear Chronos spoke agian.
55      "Time itself is an illusion.  It is only a tool that you must all learn
56 to use to your advantage.  If the time with you other is too short, learn how
57 [ch /with you/with your/  eo, sorry]
58 to make it last the eternity you wish it to be.  The other 'tricks of time'
59 are something you must seek on your own.  You know more than you may suspect."
60 The strands that were the wrap that protected Chronos seemed to turn to real
61 sand, flowing gracefully to the floor of the Inn.  As these 'living' grains
62 came to meet the floor, they passed through it to return to their own realm of
63 existance...   A sight you would not conceive, nor understand had you not seen
64 it at first hand.
65      The noises that were proof of the Inn's reality came slowly to my ears.
66 First as a whisper, then to the normal din.  My limbs felt as if Zeus himself
67 had cast a mighty bolt of lightning aside to return me to my movement.  After
68 having blinked a countless number of times it finally dawned on me what had 
69 taken place here.  I sent my gaze around the Inn to see if there were others 
70 that looked as confused as I.  They were not, they were happy.
71      And when my eyes sought out the sight of the figure I had most wanted to
72 trade words with, I saw him pick himself up and reseat hinself in such a manner
73 as to exclude me from his sight.  No, he would never lower himself to speak to
74 me, would he?  He was only contented with the sight of his "beacon".
75 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
76      As I made my way to the door, I removed the leash from my satchel and
77 began to make it ready for use.  In my dispair, I had managed to neglect many.
78 There were those that might seek my words, but they were as inhibited as I
79 when their privacy would be concerned.  There was one that watched me head for
80 my travel, wondering when the mice and music would return.  (Yes, YOU!  I am
81 wondering as well.)  Then there was another that sat at a table for two, unable
82 to leave because the meal that was ordered would soon arrive.  (Thank you for
83 the letter.  It was good to see your words again.)   There were others, but 
84 they were sitting at the counter speaking with the Innkeepers momentary relief.
85 And then there was one that would sit alone with a box and tell it many a tale
86 when the time allowed, and the dark was nigh- the one that was the idol of 
87 those that would dare sit near.
88 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
89      As Castellan for House West, a duty more taken than given, chores of other
90 than security for the household would have to be carried out by my hand.  Some
91 of these chores didn't seem to go along with the job, but it was an interesting
92 change of pace at times.k  I took the leash that I had readied and took the now
93 quieted beast back to where he could be taken care of by people that understood
94 him.  Each time I went to seek liaison with them, they would always be waiting.
95 I had never seen them anywhere near the Inn, but I knew they were close by
96 none the less.  The INDIANS had allwed me to choose the name I would be known 
97 as, not an easy chore.  At first they called me "Tschepsit," which meant
98 "Stranger" for I was one amomg them.  Other names had been told to me. They
99 were something like-  "Waskeu", "Wilisso" (although only by one of the females)
100 "Tulpe" (followed by the laughter of two), "Alleanque", and "Quis".
101      After trying to explain what I was and what I did, some said to me-
102 "Nagatamen" and "Nutiket".  I chose Nagatamen. (And I would remember Tschepsit)
103      "Come along, NIANQUE.  You are going home.  People do not understand you
104 here.  They make faces and call you names, but *I* know you are peaceful. *WE*
105 may still be friends...
106      Yes, the Indians would be my friends, and a place of Harmony for me when
107 times grew tired and miserable.  I needed th Indians Now.
108 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
109 I know... "OINK, OINK!"  I just had to get things out in the open, sort of.
110 My phone is patient, but no one calls. Either that, or not for long...

150 I looked up from my glass.  I had tried not to, but it was to the point that the effort was becomming obvious, so 
151 there was really not point to avoid her eyes.  She was watching me.  I looked into her eyes and was lost.  I blinked,
152 she was good eye contact, this one, a real talent.
153   She kept smiling, and lifted the wine glass to her mouth.  White wine through red lips.  She lifted the glass to 
154 drain the glass, and let the last ice cube fall into her open mouth.  As the glass came down she looked into my eyes.
155 I could see the ice cube moving just behind her lips.  Back and forth.  Then she pursed her lips and let the ice 
156 cube slid off her tongue into the glass.  It was a slow, deliberate movement.  She still held my eyes.  With my hand
157 I rattled the ice in my drink, hoping ( maybe ) for a bartender to hear and break the contact.  None heard.
158   I could feel the man next to me squirming in his seat.  He too had watched the ice cube.  In the corner of my eye
159 I can see him look at her, then at me, then her.  Like the ice cube.  Back and forth.
160 
161   He jogs my elbow as her ajusts his waistband.  He lifts his glass for a moment and wipes his lip.  Still his eyes
162 go back and forth.
163   I know what he thinks.  I know who he is.  No not by name, but he has a title.  I call him Gold Card.  Tonight he
164 came in with some friends.  Their all Gold Cards too.  They even look like they got their suits in the same place. God.
165 They must drive Pontiacs and Buicks.  No Cryslers, no matter how Iacoca has turned it around.  Sucessful cars,
166 sucessful clothes, sucessful shoes.  And of course, sucessful drinks.  Drinks to sucess, drinks to excess.
167 My uncomfortable neighbor was sipping his sucessful drink, while his friend wereat the other end of the bar, being 
168 sucessful with some people they had met.  He was uncomfortable because it was late, and he had been far from sucessful.
169 I had watched him earlier in the evening.  I had watched the whole sex powered circus.
170   The entire collection was here.  Warming up for St. Patty's day no doubt.  Most of them had built up quite a 
171 tolerance, they had to get a head start.  The whole gang.  The Cheese F___s, the Coke Whores, the Gold Cards, the 
172 Cowboys.  The group absurdly called regulars.  That bother me.  I didn't ever want to feel like these people were the
173 average, that this was all that there was.  Women in twos and threes at the bar, sipping their wine in tiny sips, 
174 pretending that the visiting was why they had come, that the side show didn't affect them.  Like a child ignoring a 
175 game it was not invited to play.  The men traveledin an endless merry-go-round in the bar, back and forth, around 
176 and around, never resting.  For if the carousel should stops, the music seases,and their carefully choreographed will
177 come to an end.
178   It is a carnival, but everyone is a barker, and the rides don't have pretty lights that shin for miles in cold night
179 air.  Not exactly a place to bring the kids either.  An X-rated circus where the people are the only rides.

218      The gunman reached a fence and scaled it easily.  Frank followed.  He
219 was gaining; his breath came in gasps.  "Pace yourself," he thought to 
220 himself.  "This chump's not going to get away."
221      The hound and quarry moved through backyards, climbing fences, jumping
222 obstacles.  Their chase marked by the barking of dogs and the inquisitive
223 shouts of homeowners.  Frank was closing... 20 yards... 15... He stumbled
224 for a moment, then recovered.
225      Frank topped a fence.  He saw an alleyway.  On the other side, the
226 young man labored to climb a high cedar fence.  Frank knew he almost had him
227 He bounded across the alley and scaled to the top of the fence.  Instantly,
228 he felt something was wrong.  A shiver ran through his body.  His prey had
229 disappeared.  He dropped to the ground, senses tingling.  His pulse hammered
230 in his ears; adrenaline pumped him higher than ever before.  He crouched
231 at the bottom of the fence, sucking in air, trying to regain his wind.
232 Morning dew soaked his trousers.  The world was colored black and grey.
233      As if it had a life of its own, his gun slithered from his holster.
234 Frank moved to the side searching for cover.  His eyes scanned the yard
235 seeking the fugitive.  He saw only shadows in the moonlight.  Finding a
236 wheelbarrow, Frank moved behind it.  He felt a momentary twinge of fear and
237 fought it off.
238      Frank waited a heartbeat, then two.  He held his breath.  Over the
239 throbbing in his ears, he heard a faint panting in the far corner of the 
240 yard.  He crept towards the sound.
241      Silently, Frank moved through the shadows.  This was the most terrible
242 experience in his life, yet it was his rite of passage.  He couldn't walk
243 away.  Time stretched.  Seconds seemed like hours.  He was terrified, but
244 never so alive as in this moment.
245      He neared the panting.  Suddenly, a brilliant light silhouetted Frank.
246 A flash of disorientation.  Concerned about the disturbance, a resident 
247 turned on his back porch light.  Glimpsing the drama before him, the home
248 owner darted deeper inside the house, to safety.
249      Frank stood rooted for a second.  His confidence gone.  Then his eyes
250 found the one he seeked crouched behind a small bush.  They moved in a
251 bizzare ballet.  Guns moving upward, seeking an enemy.  Frank yelled, 
252 "Freeze!"  It came as a harsh scream.
253      Their eyes locked.  Frank's finger tightened ont the trigger; his 
254 knuckles whitened.  He was rock steady.  He had no time for fear; the moment
255 seared itself in his mind.  The men stood frozen.  In the distance, a siren
256 wailed mournfully.
257      Frank screamed another command; "Drop the gun!"  No macho bullshit.
258 Dirty Harry's quips were for the movies.  This was real life.
259      Slowly, the young man's eyes flooded with fear.  His gun began to 
260 waver.  "Hey man, don't shoot;" he said.  He lowered the gun and placed it
261 on the ground.  His hands reached into the air.
262      Frank's training took over.  "Move forward to the center of the yard."
263 The gunman complied.  The commands came in succession.  "Turn around and
264 kneel... Cross your legs... Hands on top of your head."  Frank moved foward.
265 Carefully, he handcuffed his prisoner.  Behind him, the backup officers
266 walked through a gate into the backyard.  Frank took a long deep breath.
267 It was over.
268      Frank motioned to one of his rookies walking up to him.  "The gun's
269 over by that bush."
270      The officer walked over and picked it up.  Examining the large frame
271 automatic, he gave a long, low whistle and said, "Holy shit, look at the
272 size of this thing.  Somebody could have gotten killed."
273      Frank looked at his prisoner.  A smile touched their lips.  In those
274 few short minutes, they had become joined in a fearful bond.  Together,
275 they had stood at death's shoulder.  Frank knew he could kill if he had to.
276 The rite of passage was over. All he felt was exhileration; the fear would
277 overtake him tomorrow.  He turned and walked his prisoner to the awaiting
278 police car.
279                               The End

288    The piper turned away from the mournful eyes of the dragon, knowing full
289 well that her rider would come or go at her own pace.  The invitation had 
290 been extended, to press the issue less than gentlemanly.
291   Smoothing the pegasus' mane, the piper led the pegasus out of the low
292 dark stable into the milky effulgence of the moon; his feet and the pegaus'
293 hooves leaving dark trails in the frost-covered grasses, cutting through
294 like dark memories in the silver reaches of childhood.  She stood and 
295 shook her head impatiently as the piper slipped back into the main room
296 of the inn, cutting unnoticed through the warm bustle of the common room
297 and slipping back outside carrying his pipes.  
298   Sensing his parter's impatience, the piper stepped to the side of te
299 pegasus, in front of one of the great wings that she had unfurled to test
300 the wine-bright night air.  Holding his pipes, the piper mounted his steed
301 with great energy, but little grace.  Adjusting his kilt, he felt the 
302 contrast of the body heat of the pegasus on the inside of his thighs, ad
303 the sharp bite of the frosty air on the outside.  Leaning forward, he 
304 stroked the velvet neck of his mount, and whispered softly, "Let's
305 go, Peg!"
306   The great wings were fully extended now, testing the night for vagrant
307 breezes, rustling pinions, tensing against the test that was soon to come.
308 The piper felt the muscles in the body beneath him tensing, gathering an
309 awesome power; he involuntarily clamped his knees tighter to the pegass'
310 body and locked them around the leading edge of the roots of her wings.
311   Rearing back, the pegasus pawed the night winds with her forefeet, nd
312 with all the power of her hindquarters leaped into the frosty night air.
313 The pegasus' wings beat down just as the momentum of her upward leap began
314 to abate, and with a mighty surge of power she began to mount the
315 moon-limmed passages of the sky trails.

327 the required availability costume, as opposed to the simple robes worn by 
328 adults, male and female alike, and she appeared to be betteween 12 nd 14 (
329 earth equivelant) years old.
330      In his enthusiasm of the moment he kised her warmly but took no further
331 physical liberties, his moind being on other things.
332      Lenu sat in the control cabin of her singleship, suarrounded by the 
333 twinkling glow of indicatoo, control and sensing instruments.  In her hand
334 , the dellicate, intricate, sculptinmg of the subtle forces of nature, a 
335 peice of driftwood.
336      On a keypad near her other hand she entered a short sequence.  In mom-
337 ents a chime sounded.  Opening the couver of a small compartment in the 
338 console peninsula between the control seats, she removes a steaming mug of
339 lubintau elixer.

351 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (easier said...)
352      As I take my final steps before entering into the quiet, almost reclusive
353 village by nature I hear a slight whistle in the air as a blur passes over my
354 shoulder.   Ssssssssssssp!   An arrow!  Not just any arrow, but a greeting.
355      The voice that makes a recital of words that are still not easy to under-
356 stand is the one I had expected.  I had been expected, or how else would she
357 have known to use that partricular arrow?  To anyone else it would not have 
358 meant what it did to me.  You see, it had been I that had given her the score
359 of red velvet ribbons.  I had instructed her to use them only in the case of
360 dire emergency, for which I would be sure to come, or in such an ocassion as
361 now.  We were alone, the ribbon tied to the arrow told me all I needed to know.
362      I turned to see her watching me, quiver still in hand.  I dropped the
363 leash that kept Nianque by my side, he would know his way home from here, he
364 knew I wanted to be alone and lifted his paws for home.  As she returned the
365 bow and quiver to her side, I took the ribbon from the expended arrow and tied
366 it gently around her neck.  "Awullsu, how I have longed to see your face," I 
367 said.  She wore a smile, but there was a tear in her eye
368 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     --->Nagatamen, the Nutiket
369 Awullsu:  go to the place where clandestine parchments are traded and you

389     Kathyd: One of my reasons for not making an appearence here of late is
390 due to the fact that words tend to run away from me. That proves most anonying
391 to others. I have been busy. Although stories are floating in my mind, just 
392 waiting to be fished out, I have not done so yet. I will, soon. And, then I 
393 will be carefull that the spelling and grammar is correct (and that they are

424    "Damn."  She slammed the receiver down.
425    "What is it?" he asked, not looking up from the Saturday sports page.
426    She began to pace the length of the living room, arms crossed in a defensive
427 gesture.
428    "The line is busy.  She's got it off the hook, or something."  Her cheeks flamed pink with ann    
429 flamed pink with annoyance.  "She knows damn well that I need those files on the
430 Martin project today."
431    He flipped to the stats.  The Raiders had a shot at the playoffs.
432    "I can't afford to sit around and wait for her to finish trading recipes or
433 whatever it is she's tying up the line for."  She trailed her index finger along
434 the sofa table as she paced; it left a shiny path in a week's collection of d      
435 dust.  "This place is a mess," she muttered under her breath.
436    He looked up from his paper.  "I heard that."  Since he'd lost his job he'd
437 been doing the housework while she held down a 9-to-5 at a prestigious a  archi-
438 tectural firm.
439    She glared at him and continued to pace.  "What the hell is my damned sec-
440 retary doing, anyway?  Probably sharing child-nurturing tips from "Parents" 
441 magazine with one of her housewife pals.  And what am I doing?"  She stopped
442 dead in mid-pace.  "Are you listening?"
443    "Yes."  He looked over to where she stood.  "I thought it was a rhetorical
444 question."
445    "I'll tell you what I'm doing," she snapped.  "I'm counting the minutes
446 until I lose my job to Dave Peterson, because if Nancy doesn't get off the
447 phone and on the ball, Edwards Associates will dump me for that 'up-and-
448 coming' young architect."  She sneered.  "He's the fair-haired boy who can
449 do no wrong.  And speaking of boys -- old boys, that is -- how do you think
450 he got that position fresh out of school?  Why, the 'Old Boy' network, of 
451 course, unlike SOME of us", she aimed an emphatic thumb at herself, "who had
452 the guts to WORK our way up!"
453    "Is that the imperial we?" he said mildly.
454    She whirled to face him.  The cords in her neck were sharply defined by rage.
455 "What the hell does that mean?" she hissed.  "You know damn well how hard I
456 worked to get where I am today.  I'm not about to let it all slip away just
457 because my goddamned secretary can't wait to phone her friends and tell them
458 about her kid's new tooth!"
459    "It's Saturday -- doesn't she get any time off?  She only gets paid for
460 forty hours a week," he offered.
461    "And what am I supposed to tell my boss when the project is late?  'Sorry,
462 sir.  Nancy's kids cut teeth on the weekends, sir, so I didn't finish the
463 project.'  Is that it?"  She leaned across the back of the armchair and fixed
464 him with an angy stare.  "I don't think you understand how important this is.
465 Besides, if I lose my job, how are we going to pay the rent?  With your fab-
466 ulous household allowance?"
467    He neatly folded the paper.  "So that's it."  His voice was quiet, neutral.
468   "What's it?" she shouted.  "I'm sick of your damned riddles!"
469    "Resentment."
470    She stared at him, her mouth a thin white line of fury.  He looked back at
471 her, not challenging, but sympathetic.
472    "I think you've simply bottled up all the resentment you could, and now you'v
473 popped your cork, so to speak."  He shrugged.  "You resent my having lost my
474 job.  You resent being the sole breadwinner, for the moment.  You resent Dave
475 Peterson because he got a better career break than you did.  And you resent
476 Nancy's motherhood."  He shrugged.
477    She dropped into the armchair and curled up, hugging her knees.  The corners
478 of her mouth turned down in a self-conscious scowl.  "I guess you think you've
479 hit the nail on the head," she said tonelessly.
480    He shrugged again.  "Is that it?  What else do you resent?"
481    She thought for a minute.  "Everything."
482    "Everything?"  He was bemused.  "Why do you resent everything?"
483    It was her turn to shrug.  "Because it's easier than being specific."
484   The phone rang.  He reached across the end-table and answered.  She stared
485 at the floor, unmoving.
486    "Hello?  Just a moment..."  He held the receiver out to her.  "It's for you."
487    She looked up, then took the phone from him.  "Hello?"
488    "Hi, it's Nancy.  I've been trying to reach you all day, but your line's been
489 tied up.  I've got the files; got a pencil?"

492      The guards approached the olive-skinned pair,hands edging toward their
493 sword hilts. "And who was this old man?"
494      Thalion and Mallyn gave each other a quick glance.  To ad mit that this
495 was their grandfather,whan he had just been kiiled by Oraj guards, would mean
496 that they would share his fate. "We don't know, sir,"said Thalion,"except that
497 he is Rhyll, like ourselves - we only meant to give him a sea burial."
498      
"That's easily done",said the guard.  "Feed him to the sharks - NOW -
499 or you'll go in after we throw him in."  To do such a thing would harm the old 
500 man's soul, they knew; and as they started stalling, they saw two of their 
501 travelling companions sneaking up behind the Oraj guards.
502      Mallyn had half started a lengthy rhetoric on the world's religious con-
503 victions when Aliren and Cordum shoved the guards, chain mail and all, off
504 of the pier.  Then, without warning, Aliren dived in after them!
505      The other three watched for anxious seconds until Aliren surfaced, swam
506 to the ladder, and loudly announced,"I just couldn't save 'em!!"
507      Then the cheers exploded fron the neighboring trading ship.
508 /\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
509      That actually happened at our last DnD session.  Aliren got 100 exp. pts.

521 So what is going on about all the boarders?  Why can't people just use a
522 boarder that is different than the last one, if they want it to be.  Why
523 does it have to be the same thing time after time...  Oh well, to each
524 his/her own.  But one last question; why do users get so upset about people

544 The perspective had been obscured due to my ignorance. Soon, very soon,

552     From Prometheus;  Tarred and Feathered
553     My precious terminal was designed seven years ago and built five.  So it
554 should not come as a suprise that it died several days ago.  Ergo, I am not as
555 I usually try to be.  Several things demand attention though, and I will try to
556 ddress all the pressing ones.
557 
558     Borders are used to indicate the identity of the speaker, both in name, and
559 in the personality.  For instance, kathy and cistop mikey share a common one;
560 but they both are somewhat deserving.
561     On occaision do you not feel as if the joint be jumpin' when kathy sends so
562 many stars?  And do you not feel as if our Good Cistop sends us these bulletins
563 hot from accross those new telegraph thingies?

566   I sit in the semi-darkness, hunched over my keyboard, listening to the sounds
567 of the street outside and the low drone of a too low radio.  The tv shows mute
568 faces to the room, its light reaching her sleeping form on the bed.  Soft face
569 pressed into my soft pillow, the sheets pulled in a hundred different directions
570 , the smell of passions filling the room.
571   Her make-up is now just stains on a wash rag next to my sink.  When I saw it
572 I stopped and stared for a long time, then came back to the bedroom.
573   I sat and looked at the bed.  The impression in the pillow, the fold of the 
574 covers.  She moves from time to time, ajusting her sleep, pulling the blankets
575 even more.
576   A towel lays on the floor, it shares our scent.
577 
578   I have not known her long, just a few weeks really, hardly a moment.  So why
579 am I so comfortable with her, confident, content.  Willing to talk about things
580 I can share with no one else.  I let her read my works.  She liked some of them
581 and told me.  She told me the ones she didn't like as well.  I liked that.  An
582 honesty I can care for.
583   Tomorrow the sun will come up, erasing the warmth that is the darkness.  The 
584 bed will be made, the sheets and blankets smoothed out.  The doors and windows
585 will open to let in the fresh air, the towel will be folded and put away.
586   It is time to go to sleep, she woke and asked me to come to bed, I said I 
587 would be right there.
588   But first I must go in and get the wash rag, and put it where the morning will
589 not find it.

593  To continue from above, when I logged out for an emergency.  Borders are often
594 important Lsignals of individuality.  And even beyond egos, there are other an
595 and perhaps better resons to use them.
596 
597     The use of a border sometimes indicates an identity, or a mask.  Lately,
598 shadowed figuires have stepped from the shadows.  Tugging their shirts down to
599 show how nifty they are, they say nasty things about others.
600     To show how courageous they are, they run back into the shadows with their
601 tails between their legs.  Somehow their courage seems lost amidst the annoying
602 presense.

608     The Sage looked the tweny feet down, into his own bushes and tangles. The
609 ivy woven into the decaying brick and the shadows into the ivory.  The Sage
610 felt so cold, so cruel, standing atop his balcony, looking down into the night
611 that hid the fowl ones.
612 
613     To hear the vermin, scuffling stupidly about in his ivory.  To see them try
614 in vein to cover their presense.  To see them coming to his place of residence.
615 All of these things were to the Sage reprehensible.
616  
617     The would take knives, and for lack of anything else to create, they made
618 scrawlings and notches in the wood.  They would accost his guests, and then
619 would run when anyone came to their defense.
620  
621     The Sage put the thing, the weapon he was holding down.  His arm drooped
622 sadly.  And the thing drug it down to the ground where the vermin hid.
623     The plumb of gravity was inviting, and to the sleepy eyed Sage, the feel
624 of gravity in sagging him to his sheets was almost bliss.  To a tired mind,
625 it always is.
