37         "You see Farley", L'homme started has they left Ian and the office behind, "some people would have you believe
38 the NET doesn't care about its agents. Now you may not be a tutelary genius, but I am sure you are not so insensitive
39 to be unable to see the truth. We take great care and pride to see that agents are happy, since happy agents are good
40 agents. The disjointed complaints you may hear during our journey are merely the cries of those we have deemed, 'Not
41 Good Enough.' Pay them no mind, and you will be the better for it." It probably took Farley more than a moment to
42 digest what L'homme had just told him, but that would not matter, as long as he got the gist of it eventually. Fellows
43 spoke up next. "Off to the basement for briefing, and then, out into fray, where an agent belongs. We have a couple
44 missing agent status conditions to change, and the sooner the better. Besides, I miss Gaudy's home cooked chicken
45 wings!"

47         Wide eyed and bushy tailed was the only way to describe Farley after coming out of his final pre-mission
48 briefing. "I never realized your operation was so complete. I would be surprised to find out anything you guys didn't
49 know." Half-laughing, L'homme said with a grin, "That information has to come from somewhere, and this is a pretty big
50 world, wouldn't you agree? Besides, you have seen we can't even keep track of our own agents half the time; a side
51 effect from teaching them total self-support and independence. We have found an agent who feels he or she can survive
52 just about anything usually does. But on the down side such ingrained training can lead to a certain air of omniscience,
53 which can be quite dangerous, as you can imagine. Until we come up with a better way of doing things though, our
54 techniques remain the same. "I see."
55         The elevator ride to the street level was over in a flash, thanks again to a technology NET had yet to share
56 with the world, but that is another story. A two-year-old BMW 318i sat waiting for them, with doors open in eager
57 anticipation. "What about Fred?", Farley asked, with more than a note of concern in his voice. "Don't worry about your
58 friend. He'll join us soon enough." Fellows drove, with Farley in the front passenger seat, and L'homme in the rear
59 behind the driver. "I hope you aren't a backseat driver like my mother-in-law is!", quipped Fellows. "Fellows old chap, 
60 I never knew you were married. When where why and with whom?" "Maybe another time. You know the rules against NET agents
61 having close families that could be used to coerce an agent into doing something he wouldn't normally do." "And you
62 managed to hide it from Ian. Amazing!" "Let's drop it. OK?" #I have touched a soft spot. I better let it go for now,
63 but file it under 'things to do on a rainy day.'# L'homme said to himself, and then aloud, "Northwest Portland. The area
64 around 19th and Lovejoy. Intelligence reports some strange activity that may give us a clue to the whereabouts of Minsky
65 and Flemming" "Aye Aye Captain!", replied the driver. Farley gripped the fine Corinthian leather seat, sat back, and
66 began to have second thoughts about what he had gotten himself into.

91   "Maybe so, Magen, but there are other things in life besides gazing at the
92 stars. People here on the island can learn about the rest of the world by
93 watching television. They can become educated and take their place in
94 society. They can have a good paying job. They can buy lots of nice things
95 to make their lives better."
96   "You're beginning to sound like one of those leaflets the power company
97 gives out. Raza, is your life really better? Are you happy?"
98   "And what's wrong with wanting to get a few things?"
99   "It's not what you get it's what you give up."
100   "What do you mean by that? Some special insight that has come to you
101 living out here in the wild...in the roots of a tree for God's sake."
102   "The Great Banyan Tree always has a special place in the sacred carvings.
103 It's the "tree of egde'onk". I am honored it allows me to make it my home."
104   "Stories for children. Superstitious bunk!" Raza gave a great sweep with
105 his hand as if to dismiss the entire affair.
106   "The underwater caves around by the cliffs and the carvings inside are a
107 little more than superstition. How do you explain them away?"
108   "I don't need to explain them. It's just a bunch of drawings scratched on
109 the cave walls, not very good drawing at that."
110   "Oh Raza, what have they done to you to make you say such a thing. They
111 are your heritage. The pictures tell the story of the ancient practices."
112   "Sure they do!"
113   "Raza, I wish you could hear how you sound. This just proves my point
114 about the water and the hum. After people drink the water from the power
115 plant and live around the hum awhile they forget how things were before."
116   "That's exactly what I came to talk to you about. You've got to stop
117 talking that way. Some of that bunch of lazy bums from Coki Point have been
118 listening to your little `market sermons'. They've formed a group that plans
119 to put the power plant out of operation. If it doesn't stop now somebody is
120 going to get hurt."
121   "I'm against violence in any form."
122   "In that case you'd be smart to keep quiet and quit stirring those people
123 up. In time they'll see the advantages new development brings."
124   "Not unless you get them hooked up to the hum."
125   "That does it! It's pretty obvious I wasted my time coming out here, you
126 aren't even listening to me. Well, you can tell them I intend to do whatever
127 it takes to protect the plant. And I intend to keep doing my job there."
128   "I too must do what I think is right, I must tell what I see."
129   "Whatever's fair, Magen."
130   "Fair? Fair is not at all real. It is not something you can touch or feel
131 or taste or smell. You can't carry it home like an armful of coconuts. It is
132 not a part of nature like the wind or rain or sea or sun. Fair is simply as
133 idea. It was created to mark the midpoint between dreams and despair."
134   Raza looked at me in a puzzled sort of way then turned and walked off down
135 the beach without saying another thing. I listened to the words again in my
136 mind. Who had said that? It had been my mouth doing the talking, but who had
137 said it? Raza is right, I have changed, but at least I can still remember.

140 I still really hadn't completely recovered from meeting Ian, but, nevertheless, I was off with L'homme and Fellows on
141 a REAL assignment.  For a moment, I thought back on my days as a private detective, out on my own.  But didn't L'homme
142 say NET agents were independent?  Thinking a few minutes upon it, I decided that I was better off with NET.  No 
143 frantic scurrying for rent money at the end of the month, no walking the streets in search of someone's missing kid...
144 Fellows seemed to be an excellent driver, although it's hard to tell at slow speeds.  Somehow I had the feeling that
145 if we needed to, he'd send the car into an intricate series of turns that would lose any tail.
146 I wondered, idly, what my fortune would be with NET.  Better off, yes, but how so?  Happy?  If not, what would make me
147 happy?  My thoughts churned around and around until my mind seemed to be in the center of a maelstrom of thoughts.
148 "Well, Farley," L'homme began, "What do you think of being an agent so far?"
149 "Oh, I'm still not sure what to think.  I've not quite adjusted to the idea that I'm on your side, instead of trying
150 to compete against you."
151 "You had better adjust quickly.  In a stress situation, any doubt can be dangerous," Fellows said.
152 "He's right, you know," L'homme whispered.  "Any delay in reacting can..."
153 "I know perfectly well what it can do.  Why do you suppose I've told you?  Just be sure you remember that I've not
154 been tested.  I'll try to remember what all of you have told me."
155 "Fine, then.  Good, we've almost arrived, I'm curious to see your car."
156 "Fred?  He looks rather normal- like an '84 Vette.  Until you punch in the correct sequence."
157 "What then?" Fellows asked.
158 "One of his panels revolves, and a speaker, mike, and CRT move out."
159 "Oh?  Voice recognition, then."
160 "I suppose so," was all I had time to reply.  A large semi-trailer with the emblem "Duncan Hines Fruit Cakes" was
161 parked on the street ahead of us a few blocks away.  "Is that it?"
162 L'homme glanced at the trailer parked near the supermarket.  "Yes, it is.  One of these days I'm going to find out
163 who's in charge of decals in the Camoflauge Department.  His sense of humor bothers me."
164 Fellows looked to see what L'homme's fuss was about.  "Fruit Cakes?!?", he laughed.  "What a disguise!"
165 Fellows parked the car as he chuckled for a bit more.  We approached the cab compartment, then waited.
166 A short fellow I didn't recognise poked his head out the window after several moments.  "Fellows, L'homme, and Farley?"
167 We nodded.  "A little present for you!"  With that, the barrel of a submachine gun jutted out from the cab door.
168 A half-second of surprise was all I allowed myself.  #TestTestTestTest# went through my mind as I made use of the 
169 energy pent up inside.  I dived and rolled, bringing up Betsy as I did so.
170 Fellows had managed to position himself under the trailer, and L'homme was nowhere to be seen.  The short man, only 
171 now reacting to our movements, fired off a half-dozen rounds.
172 I had Besty up and aimed when I heard a dull THUNK! in the cab.  I waited a little more, to be rewarded by seeing
173 L'homme's face popping up.
174 "You see," he said, opening the door to let himself out, "finding cover is not always enough.  Effectively disabling
175 the enemy is also a factor.  You did, however, do fairly well.  Now let's go insid e and see your car friend."

210 When you sing of Columbia or the Eagle
211 And reach for the stars as your ultimate goal.
212 Recall who fell along the way,
213 For the star-road takes a fearful toll,
214 The star-road takes a fearful toll.
215 
216 And it might have been Armstrong, Aldrin, Cernan,
217 Shepard, Carpenter, Cooper, or Glenn.
218 They all knew well the questor's fee,
219 And the star-road's paved with the lives of men,
220 The star-road's paved with the lives of men.
221 
222 For the price was paid on a winter evening
223 When "Fire in the spacecraft!" somebody said.
224 In smoke and flame the shadow passed
225 And in Capsule Twelve three men were dead,
226 In Capsule Twelve three men were dead.
227 
228 Forget not yet who paid the forfeit
229 To conquer the stars in the Eagle's flight.
230 "It's worth the price." they said who paid:

239         The Phoenix (words & music: Julia Ecklar)
240 In a tower of flame on Test Pad Two, I was there.
241 I know not where they laid my bones; it could be anywhere.
242 But when fire and smoke had faded, the darkness left my sight...
243 And I found my soul in a spaceship's soul, riding home on a trail of light.
244 Chorus: And my wing are made of tungsten, my flesh of glass and steel.
245         I am the joy of Terra for the power that I weild.
246         Once upon a lifetime I died a pioneer;
247         Now I sing within a spaceship's heart. Does anybody hear?
248 Before each morning's launch, they know that I am there.
249 To the the soul that warms this vessel's hull they say a silent prayer.
250 I am father, ship, and spirit of the dream for which they strive.
251 For I am man at the hands of man; See us rocket for the sky!
252 CHORUS
253 My thunder rends the morning sky. Yes, I am here!
254 Though lost to flame when I was man, now I ride her without fear.
255 For I am more than man now, and man built me with pride.
256 Oh, I led the way, and I lead the way, of man's future in the sky!

263 were being dialed...
264 
265     the black casing of the terminal seemed out of place on the rotting wood... entire terminal was on some cargo crates...
266 from the stench of salt and rough weather... they had been taken from the sea... a side benefit of having a small salvaging
267 operation for a cover... free furniture...
268 
269     initial reports were starting to filter in... agent farley was now being given net documentation and induction... and only
270 now were reports being filed about the elusive Underground... apparently a government throw away... allocate the funds... and
271 try to forget the scum you are paying for...
272     from what little data was available... underground seemed like a small agency... probably stumbled on the net impersonaton
273 idea... everything pointed to an agency that was small to say the least... and thrike's only major concern was secrecy... how
274 could such an agency... presumably with mal-trained agents... avoid detection by a spy detection agency...?

278     "aw mom, why do i have to eat it?" whined a young tilean.
279     "there are starving children in india, you ought to eat your food and be thankfull."
280     "aw, alright" tilean hated that, it seemed obnoxious to have such a typical saying, and there not be a typical answer.
281     "but not eating my dinner is not going to save them, is it ma?" perhaps we will find one thought tilean.
282     "no, maybe if i stop feeding you all together, and let you starve for a few weeks, then you might save them later. knowing
283 what they go through every day of their lives."
284 
285     "fooey!" tilea's active imagination started working against him now, providing all sorts of pictures to him.
286     after a long period of silence, broken only by the faint whining of dread whenever tilean's fork got too close to his outh
287 mouth, did anyone speak.
288     "what did you do today on that hill, boy?" asked his father, a strong burly man, with thick arms and a soft deep voice.
289     "nothing. just sat, and thought. nothing" lied tilean.
290     "whad'ya think about?"
291     "why we even want to eat, we will waste away the energy, and then we will want more. there is never any end, always some
292 one is scrambling for food, or promotion, or pay. i asked Why."
293 
294     tilean's family cast suspiscious glances to each other, then realized he was serious, tilean's father spoke again.
295     "well, i dunno, son, but people have been thinking on that for thousands of years, and if we both go down to the library
296 tomorrow, i am sure we'll find a book on it there."
297 
298     it was painfull to see his father admit to not knowing something.

327 ===================================
328 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
329 
330     The  chilly northern air whipped angrily about the deck of the sturdy longship,  penetrating Thorvald's old bones as 
331 he expertly maneuvered his craft toward the approaching shoreline.   In the distance, bleak mountainsides were bathed in 
332 a rosy glow by the ever-present summer sun,  sailing low across the arctic skies.  Many other Northmen had made the long 
333 journey to Iceland, seeking to regain the beloved freedom that had been wrested from them by the self-proclaimed monarch 
334 of  the Northern people.   Hundreds of families had already immigrated to Iceland,  wealthy jarls accompanied by  wives, 
335 children,  livestock,  and slaves.  The rocky island was beautiful but barren; few grains could survive the inhospitable 
336 cold  and  no trees existed to provide badly needed timber.   Iceland offered nothing to these first  settlers  but  the 
337 freedom to govern their own lives.  To these proud nobles, it was incentive enough.
338     Thorvald's icy blue gaze swept over the vast ocean as he pondered his destiny, as he had done many times during this 
339 voyage.   Would this journey be his last,  he asked himself.   Many winters had come and gone since he had first stepped 
340 onto the deck of his own father's magnificent knorr, symbolically entering into manhood by doing so.  Patiently, the old 
341 warrior  had taught Thorvald the mysteries of the sea,  passing on centuries of accumulated wisdom.   The mariners  that 
342 ruled the North seas in the tenth century were truly masters of the ocean,  fearlessly navigating the icy Atlantic while 
343 acquiring undefended lands and unbelievable wealth.
344     A  noisy  flock  of  seagulls appeared overhead,  circling the bay as if to guide Thorvald's ship  toward  a  smooth 
345 landing.   The weatherbeaten old jarl took a deep breath, feeling the icy air enter his lungs more viciously, it seemed, 
346 than  in years past.   He felt the urge to cough and grimaced from the resultant pain.   What would his father think  of 
347 him, a warrior once mighty and brave, reduced by sickness to die like an old woman?
348     Surely  Odin could not ignore a lifetime of brave and heroic deeds.   Thorvald had once been a powerful jarl in  the 
349 district  of Jaeren,  respected by freemen and slaves alike.   No other clan in Norway could match the  fierceness  with 
350 which Thorvald led his yearly voyages to unprotected European coastal settlements.   He had always expected nothing less 
351 than  absolute  loyalty  from  his men,  knowing that they were indeed proud to be included in  such  a  courageous  and 
352 successful band.   What tremendous exhilaration they felt during those bloody battles,  inspired by Thorvald's supremely 
353 confident manner as he led his soldiers into war.   What he would have given,  Thorvald thought to himself,  for some of 
354 that confidence today.
355     He watched his son Eirik ascend the ladder.   The salty winds changed direction suddenly, tangling the boy's coppery 
356 hair  wildly  about his face,  ruddy from sun and wind.   Thorvald suddenly remembered being just such a young man  some 
357 forty years before,  with his idealistic expectations of victory in the things he attempted.  What had happened in those 
358 forty years,  he wondered,  to erode away that feeling in himself?  Thorvald was determined, more than ever before, that 
359 Eirik's life could be different.  Here in Iceland, the two of them would make a new start, together.
360     Thorvald stood up to his full height and thrust out his chest as he shouted commands to the ship's crew.   With some 
361 effort,  the  knorr was anchored securely and the wooden masts tied with thick ropes.   The men prepared to  unload  the 
362 animals,  whose incessant bleating filled the air as they were hastily led down the swaying ramp.   One old ewe stumbled 
363 on the way down, breaking a hind leg; she would be quickly shorn and then butchered for their evening supper.
364     The  crew worked as rapidly as possible.   Over the years,  each of Thorvald's men had developed special skills that 
365 made  him particularly valuable to the group,  and a system of leadership had evolved that relieved Thorvald of much  of 
366 the minor decision making.   The karls that had shared his land for generations were very clever, and he was quite aware 
367 that  had  they been born into nobility,  they might have become splendid jarls.   Thorvald knew that if ever  the  need 
368 arose, he would undoubtedly avenge a murder with the same zeal as if the fallen karl were his own brother.
369     As the arctic sun slid slowly downward,  barely touching the horizon,  the men were finally ordered to stop  working 
370 for  the day.   Exhausted,  they silently ate the simple repast their women had prepared.   Without even the traditional 
371 evening poem or joke told around the campfire that night,  the families found their warm furs and slept under the  dusky 
372 skies.
373     In  the weeks that followed,  Thorvald led a discouraging search for land.   The few areas of the mountainous island 
374 that  were  actually suitable for agriculture had long been claimed,  generally by vealthy kings and jarls  who  had  no 
375 intention of remaining in Iceland.  Once these lands had become the property of the rich, they were divided into smaller 
376 farms,  sold at the discretion of the owners to the new immigrants at whatever price the market would bear.  By the time 
377 Thorvald's clan had arrived,  the best land they could obtain was a rocky,  uneven section of land near Hornstrandir, in 
378 northwestern Iceland.  They were told succinctly that as newcomers, they could hope for nothing better.
379     Angered by this discovery, Thorvald nevertheless commanded the long journey from their temporary camp toward the new 
380 farmland called Drangar.   The terrain, even following the coastline, was rugged, with steep slopes of volcanic rock and 
381 madly charging rivers running between.  They reached their destination after having seen one-fourth of their animals die 
382  
383 unexplainably, and several of Thorvald's thralls, never having fully recovered from the ocean-sickness, died also.

416    The first thing that Jack could see once he returned to the living was the 
417 dingy white of the hospitals ER. After that, the scent of Marcis perfume had
418 brought back pieces of the memory of what had been the life he had once lived
419 in happiness. Determined to see her face once again, he forced himself to sit up
420 and turn to look at her. As he did this the pain in his arm served as a brutal 
421 reminder that these were not the best of times.
422    "Marci...   Marci, where are you? I can't see... " was all he could say 
423 before he collapsed back onto the strecher. Conditioning could not keep him 
424 concious when he had lost too much blood.
425    "Jack!" Marci rushed to return to his side once she heard his weak voice
426 call her name.  #Damn these hospital procedures! Jack could be dying for all we
427 know# thought Marci as she placed her arm under Jack's head to try to ease the
428 stiffness of the strecher. 
429      Tony let Tina take care of the rest of the administrative nonsence in 
430 order to see if there was any change in Jacks condition.
431      "Is he alright? I heard him say something a moment ago," asked Tony.
432      "He was calling my name if you didn't notice, Mr. Ross. Or can't you tell
433 that he isn't in so graet of shape?" blurted Marci in reply.
434      "Hey, hold on! I'm sorry, No need to get defensive. I'm just as concerned
435 about Jack's condition as you are, except mine are for more professional 
436 reasons." 
437      Marci just turned and stared back at Tony with a gaze that chilled.
438      "You don't understand. You never will." she said and then returned her
439 attention to the man in her arms as he moved.
440      Jack was restless and began to mutter something that didn't make sence.
441      "(mumble) Alpha November Five South... NO, SOUTH!!" At that, Tony slapped
442 his hand over Jack's mouth and tried to get the nurses attention. It didn't
443 seem to be working because the nurse was still in a smiling trance over the
444 sight of Marci's Gold Mastercard.
445      "Once your all patched up, Jack ol' boy, I'm gonna have to leave this 
446 place some token of our appreciation." said Tony as he cracked an evil grin.

483 Hello everyone. Back again after a few days' absense due to that bane of all
484 teCRT artists everywhere: busy signals. Well, I have a bit of a story to put
485 up. I hope that it isn't too, well, too bad. I am not too sure of its worth
486 compared to all the wonderful things I see here, but here goes anyway...

496 The stories continued.  Seeing a few that sparked my interest, I decided to
497 go into what people here call "lurk mode".  Alas, my being is not used to being
498 kept silent, so I enter again.
499   I find myself constantly surprised at the fact that Backwater always seems
500 to "keep in tune" with my other-planal life.  My english class began a unit on
501 poetry only a little while ago.
502 DEBATERS- Since you seem to have quieted down for a bit, why don't you discuss
503 the 'Aryans'.  In case your memory fails you, they are a group of 'christians'
504 that go to extremely violent measures to rid themselves of the danger that they
505 see, the Jews.  In a recent news broadcast, I saw that they employ B.B.S.
506 systems to keep track of known Jews in a sort of "Jew watch".
507 I myself think these people pose a greater threat to anyone's moral standards
508 than the Rajneeshi's ever did.  At least the Rajneeshi's didn't keep track
509 of their 'enemies' in a hit-list format.  Does anyone know more about Aryans
510 or their beliefs?  Anyone want to comment?

533 Hidding in the shadows, leaving small restless markings, the cat nervously
534 scans the Inn. The constant roar of the crowd drowns the small noise that
535 is made. The flickering fire in the hearth echos distorted shadows of those
536 it encounters. As a momentary clearing in the crowd allows the fire to 
537 shine upon the cat, its shadow ripples and flares, creating images of great
538 gold trimmed wings flashing for a moment, and then it is gone, leaving
539 only random shadows once again.

543                                ( episode X+3)
544   It was tediously slow, in the past two hours he had passed only three side
545 corridors.  He had tried to take the first one he thought he could see light
546 reflecting off the polished metal of the shaft.  No luck.  The corner was to
547 tight to manage.  If he came to the end, or if it split into other shafts, 
548 he would be trapped.
549   They would be searck
550   they would be searching more throughly for him now.  There was no way to 
551 leave the station.  It would be obvious soon that he was somehow outside 
552 the normal security area.  If it went on too long they might check more
553 deeply into the security control system, and he hadn't been able to clean up
554 all of his handywork.  He had better show himself and give them something
555 else to do.  He quicked his pace, disreguarding the noise.
556   Some five minutes later he could see a grill up ahead in the right hand
557 wall, but the light was so dim as to be almost invisible, he could only
558 see it with eyes slightly averted.
559   He stopped for a minute, breathing shallowly, listening.  Nothing.  He 
560 covered the last few feet as quietly as he could.  The shaft made soft
561 rumbling sounds as it warmed and cooled through its cycle.  He smiled,
562 maybe he would be mistaken as a bit of hot air.
563   He felt around the inside of the grill.  The almost light coming through
564 the slots was of no help, it was only a faint grey in the ink black of the
565 shaft.  Four bolts.  No release.  It was to much to ask.
566   The back of the knife was toothed.  He started on the closest bottom bolt.
567 
568 Dried blood flew from the teeth, falling on his arms and face.  After a 
569 moment it stopped.
570   He left one of the top bolts and bent the grill out, swinging it from in
571 front of the opening.
572   He couldn't see the floor, or even the shape of the room.  Grabbing the 
573 lip of the shaft he forced his body partway through the opening.  It was
574 going to be tight turning this corner.  When he got both arms out he searched
575 for a handhold.  More nothing.  He would have to drop.
576   Squirming around he mannaged to get his waist through the opening.  
577 hanging down the wall with arms outstreached.  He had parachuted once.
578 He had hated it.  But at least you could see how far you would fall.
579   He let himself drop.

582 P.s. To the Fine tooth comber
583      The use of the phrase "tediously slow" was intentional.  I hope we are
584    allowed to use redundancy to indicate degree.
585      Also the phrase "ink black", surely you have heard of other colors of 
586    ink.

589 After slipping on a loose-fitting terry robe, Christine led me from the bathroom to a somewhat less feminine room,
590 where I found some decent clothes lying on a very comfortable looking bed, this time with blue sheets. As she stepped
591 out of the room, I let the red robe fall to the floor and doexamined the gray suit that someone had, by the look of it,
592 paid a good sum of money for. #Boy, they don't miss a trick#, I thought as I donned the pleated trousers.
593 My thoughts drifted back to my recent bath. For the first time in years, I had sat in a tub without my Mr. Bubble.
594 #Definately an interesting experience.#. Just as I was pulling the jacket over my shoulders, Christine entered the room.
595 "Don't you ever knock?" I asked, noting how much that sounded like a line from a movie, "No." She replied bluntly.
596 She didn't appear to have anything to add to that, so I decided to let that one lie for a while. "Umm, pardon me for
597 continually prying into your affairs, but, Ummm, exactly what expertise of mine do you and your father need?"
598 "Why don't you ask him yourself, You're going to see him as soon as your done getting dressed." 
599 #Ah ha!! That explains the suit!#, I thought, immediately thinking how stupid that thought was. #Boy, good thing that was
600 just a thought!#, I thought, gaining back some of my mental composure.
601 She must have noticed that I was not doing much besides standing idly, because she took my hand into hers and began to 
602 pull me along behind her.
603 After several minutes of walking through an enourmous and well-furnished house, we came to an unobtrusive looking door, 
604 painted dark blue, just like every other door in the building.
605 She reached out and gave the knob a twist. The door swung inward to reveal a rather plain office, with almost spartan 
606 furnishings. Behind a large, black wooden desk, smoking one of the smelliest cigars I have ever encountered, was an 
607 enourmously fat man, with inhumanly pale skin. The plate at the front of his desk read: "Zachary Leason".
608 Upon seeing me, the man behind the desk, who I assumed to be Zachary Leason, Stood up in an explosion friendliness
609 that was almost surreal in it's intensity. "Good day Dr. Danforth, I am very pleased, yes very pleased to make your 
610 acquaintance. Very pleased, yes." He walked out from behind his desk, revealing his incredible resemblance to a talking 
611 pear, and stepped within range of an unusually wet handshake. "Umm, Is it safe to assume that Christine has told you of
612 our need for your skills?" He inquired, holding open a box of his cheap cigars. "Not entirely. No one has said anything 
613 about what you want me to do.", I answered, shaking my head  in reply to his offer.
614 "Ohhh, I must apologize for that." He said in his typical jolly fat-man voice," Yes, I must apologize. Well, have a 
615 seat, and we'll discuss your possible employment." He seemed to have a habit of offering things while he wawas speaking, 
616 I thought as I positioned myself into the sparsely padded chair he had gestured to.
617 He plunked down behind the desk and laid his hamhock arms down on the smooth polished surface. He beganexplain what he 
618 wanted me to do, and my interest was stirred...
