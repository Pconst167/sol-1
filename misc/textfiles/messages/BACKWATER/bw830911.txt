33    We need some mental stimulation to flex our heads.  The imagination is
34 a bottomless well which can be drawn from and is never exhausted.  Here are
35 some ideas I have gathered from friends and acquaintances to titilate your
36 imagination and just possibly end in something than makes a difference to 
37 someone or all of us in a positive way.
38  
39         What would happen if two black holes collided?  Would they eat each
40 other up?  Would you have a BIG BLACK HOLE? Or would you have a really small
41 black  hole?  Or would they cancell each other out and result in no black hole
42 at all?  
43  
44 ******************************************************************************
45  
46         Who wants to believe in things that are not true? What is truth?  Is it
47 necessarily a subjective evaluation of reality, since none of us have any way 
48 of verifying that our perceptions are identical with others' perceptions?
49 For example, what makes you think that the moon is NOT made of green cheese?
50 You take it on faith that the authorities who claim to have investigated the
51 moon would not tell you something that was not true, right?
52         Does truth boil down to defense of an argument using mental tools that
53 are generally acceptable (e.g.  logic, rationality, persuasion)?  If you can 
54 defend your argument well then you create a belief and increase your credibil-
55 ity as a source of truth.  But doesn't personal subjective experience ultimately
56 determine whether your "truth" is true?
57 ********************************************************************************
58      A GOOD IDEA:  You could write a program that would display requested
59 quadrants of the night sky from any place on earth at any time.  Constellations
60 could be displayed automatically or by individual request, which would be a
61 really valuable tool for teaching astronomy.  But how would you write this 
62 program and where would you get the raw data?
63 *******************************************************************************
64         Did you ever wonder if it is possible to have a "fast-forward" feature 
65 for ordinary television?  Perhaps it could be done using bubble memory to 
66 continuously recycle the transmission through the memory.  Perhaps two or three
67 minutes of video and audio information could be stored in a relatively 
68 economical bubble memory circuit so that under normal circumstances you are
69 watching what was transmitted two or three minutes previous.  When you get to
70 a commercial segment, you push the fast-forward and zip through the commercials
71 to arrive at "real time" transmission.  When you leave the room for a beer or
72 a bathroom break, you push the bubble memory buffer switch and it loads it up
73 again.
74 ********************************************************************************
75 IF YOU HAD THE ATTENTION OF THE ENTIRE WORLD FOR A MINUTE, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
76 *******************************************************************************
77         When the space shuttle comes into the atmosphere there is a blackout 
78 period of about 15 minutes.  This has to do with the plasma that is generated
79 as it enters the atmosphere.  I know there is a way to communicate with the
80 space shuttle during this period.  In any plasma or dielectric field there is
81 a certain frequency that will not penetrate and there is at least one frequency
82 that will.  They just haven't been playing around hard enough to find those
83 frequencies.
84 *******************************************************************************
85         Is PEACE something that is attainable? Is it a quality of human 
86 civilization or is it merely a state of mind?  And if you are in that 
87 state of mind can external events disturb your "peace?"  Is there such 
88 a thing as a "moderate degree of peace" or is peace an absolute, either
89 totally here right now or totally absent right now?
90 ****************************************************************************
91         What do Christians mean when they say they are surrendering their
92 life to Christ (God)?  Is it perhaps the "FLOW" of human energy generated
93 by other peoples wills, what they consider best for you and society, what 
94 they want to happen and what they believe needs to be done?
95 Are they perhaps surrendering their will to the will of others?
96 ***************************************************************************
97         Imagine for a minute that UFO's were actually the vehicles of 
98 extraterrestial beings who are watching us as we evolve into higher order
99 beings. How could we communicate with these beings and persuade them to
100 use their advanced intelligence and technology to assist us in surviving
101 the nuclear age?  What could we say to them that would be persuasive enough
102 to get their cooperation?  Could we tell them that we are willing to be 
103 used by them, as agents of their empire, in return for their assistance?
104 What superior qualities could we show them that we possess to convince them
105 that our race is worth their effort?  Why should they get actively involved?
106 Are they already actively involved in guiding our evolution into cosmic
107 beings?  What are their motives and goals in observing our civilization?
108 Is there any way we could assist them in achieving what they desire to 
109 achieve?
110 ******************************************************************************
111       Many studies have indicated that we have a propensity to 
112 enter into either heterosexual or homosexual experiences at various times in
113 our lives.  Why then do we persist to claim validity in the terms "homosexual"
114 and "heterosexual" when in fact we are neither?  Homosexual and heterosexual 
115 are valid terms to define specific actions, not to describe the complete
116 behavior pattern of an individual.  Could it be that we use these words to 
117 feel "safe" or "right" in comparison to others?  How many people who claim to
118 be heterosexuals are just ignoring the truth of the matter ... that they 
119 actually have homosexual desires, fantasies and experiences?
120 ******************************************************************************
121         It has been said that competition breeds prejudice and that prejudice
122 is a form of evil. If this is true, why do we find such amusement in sports
123 competition? Are sports evil?  It doesn't appear that there is a simple 
124 answer, but most popular sports today are structured so that there is a 
125 winning team and a loosing team.  How could we structure sports so that
126 more than one party could "WIN" and that no party would need to loose?
127 If we managed to do this, and I believe we could, would it be a positive
128 step forward in human evolution? Would the masses accept it or are they 
129 so programmed with the dualistic winner/loser mentality that they could
130 not appreciate a sport unless there was a "top dog?"  What about
131 the possibility that we could challenge each other in positive ways without
132 creating losers and without the need for winners? What would the rules of
133 such sports be like?
134 *******************************************************************************
135         Imagine if you will that every person you meet already knows every
136 piece of information you could possible tell them about your personal life.
137 How would you react to people?  You probably would not bullshit them, because
138 you would see immediately how they perceived that you were just bullshitting.
139 You would probably be more willing to talk about intimate details of your
140 life with relative strangers and your capacity to love friends would be 
141 greatly enhanced.  Try it and see.  I have been living this way for several
142 years and my experience tells me that there is a certain element of truth
143 to the basic proposition that we all know everything about each other. 
144 Perhaps there is some subtle wavelength of mental or spiritual communication
145 or perhaps we simply read each others body language and physical character-
146 istics like you would read a book.  It is well known that lovers can 
147 telepathize and "hear each other think."  Perhaps we do this subconsciously
148 all the time and that it only becomes conscious when we are "high" on love
149 or drugs.

417 	As for some of the topics:
418 1. Tell me the mass, charge, angular momentum, & relative velocities
419 of those two black holes and I can get an answer for you. Most likely
420 result is a bigger black hole.
421 2. The plasma sheath problem is somewhat more complicated than
422 you seem to think. The composition etc are NOT constant, thus the
423 frequency required would be shifting constantly.
424 3. As for your "sports where everyone wins", have you looked into
425 role-playing games? They aren't necessarily sports, but they may
426 provide a starting point.
427 	
428 As a final note, I might respect your use of the preceding 400
429 lines more if the material hadn't so obviously been dumped UN-EDITED
430 from another system.

434 THIS DISK FILLED UP SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE.  OH WELL, THAT'S LIFE.
435      I'VE BEEN AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND (AND HAD A LOT OF FUN), SO I'M A BIT BEHIND, BUT I PROMISE I'LL TRY TO CATCH UP.
436      REGARDING THE QUESTION ABOUT  RAPE BEING PERFORMED BY SOMEONE THE  VICTIM  KNOWS IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES, THAT 
437 IS A HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER.  ACCORDING TO STUDIES DONE BY THE U.S. CENSUS, THE FBI, AND THE N.O.R., 50% OF RAPES ARE
438 "AQUAINTANCE" RAPES, AND ONLY 3.5 TO 10% OF RAPES ARE EVEN REPORTED. IF YOU KNOW THE ASSAILANT EVEN SLIGHTLY, CHANCES
439 ARE YOU WON'T  REPORT IT,  BECAUSE THE  D.A., POLICE, ETC., ASSUME THAT IF YOU  KNEW YOUR ASSAILANT, YOU PROBABLY
440 BROUGHT IT ON BY TEMPTING THEM.  AND IF IT DOES GET TO COURT, IF THE ASSAILANT  DIDN'T HURT THE VICTIM PHYSICALLY
441 (SUCH AS MUTILATION), HE IS  LIKELY  TO RECEIVE A FINE OR A SUSPENDED SENTENCE.  WOULD YOU REPORT A CRIME KNOWING THAT
442 EVEN IF YOU GET A CONVICTION, HE WON'T  EVEN GO TO JAIL FOR A DAY, AND WILL WANT REVENGE?  NOT ME.                     
443      CHARLOTTE, I'VE FOUND THE ISSUE OF BYTE MAGAZINE REFERRED TO EARLIER.  ITS SEPTEMBER 1982, VOL. 7, NO.9., AND
444 THOUGH IT HAS A NUMBER OF VERY GOOD AND INFORMATIVE ARTICLES, ITS NOT QUITE WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.   HAND-HELD
445 SPEECH SYNTHESIS FOR THE NONVOCAL, NEW  TERMINALS THAT TALK FOR THE BLIND, ETC.. WHILE THESE ARE GREAT, THEY AREN'T
446 QUITE THE THING.   ANOTHER  SUGGESTION  MIGHT BE FOR YOU TO CHECK THE LIBRARY AT THE OREGON HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY 
447 UP ON THE HILL.  THEY HAVE THE LARGEST  SELECTION OF MATERIAL RELATING TO THIS  SUBJECT.

451 RE Black hole collisions:
452 	The January 1977 Scientific American has a great article on the quantum
453 mechanics of black holes.  To answer the question, thee result would be a black
454 hole that is larger (i.e. has a larger Schwarzschild radius (event horizion)
455 )
456 then would be predicted by merely adding the two masses.  The formula is:
457 
458 R =  2 G M
459      -----
460         2
461        C
462      
463 Where G is Newtons constant of gravity, M is the mass, and c is the speed of light.
464 
465 Well let's say we have two black holes, one of mass M1 the other M2.  The result
466 is:
467 
468 OOPS, one more thing.  R    is the result of the two combined black holes.
469 
470       2 G (M1 + M2)
471 R >   -------------
472              2
473             C
474 
475 Well, c and G can't (??) change therefore we must have gotten some more
476 mass from somewhere.
477 
478 To pioneer:
479      About my /0 numbers (from now on to be referred to as the "UNREAL"
480 numbers), this is where I got the idea:
481 
482    A
483   --- = C
484    B
485 
486 Because,
487 
488 A = C * B
489 
490 Well, if you take      0
491                       ---
492                        0
493  it can be simplified to:
494 
495 0 = C * 0   using the second equation.
496             Therefore the solution set to "C" in either equation is the
497             set of real numbers.
498 
499 Now, if you take       1     or any other non 0 number
500                        ---
501                         0
502 
503 it can be simplified to:
504 
505 1 = C * 0  using the second equation.
506            Therefore the solution set to "C" in this case is null
507            if we only include the real and imaginary numbers as possible
508            solution sets, but if we include the UNREAL numbers we now have
509            a solution.  I remember the imaginary numbers starting the same
510            way.
511 
512 One interesting thing is that we loose the "uniqueness" of one dimension
513 the smallest thing we can work with is a complete number line like
514 all the reals, but not a PARTICULAR real number.  Talk to me about 4D
515 Maybe these two concepts are more closely related than either of us 
516 realizes.
517 BYE                                                                  THE DOCTOR

520 - Sounds very good Doctor, but what practical use would it be? (Maybe I'm just-
521 - unimaginative.) It would be fun working with problems like that if you were -
522 - a "pure" mathematician who worked with number theory.                       -
523 -                                                                             -
524 - As to a four-dimensional creature, here is my theory:                       -
525 -                                                                             -
526 - I've always equated Time = the 4th dimension. I don't know how I thought    -
527 - this up, but I think somebody told me that was what physicists also equated -
528 - the 4th dimension to. Anyway, a 4th-dimensional creature would have heighth -
529 - length, and width and would also take up some period of time.               -
530 -    The words are easy to talk about but it is hard to conceive of being more-
531 - than one "time" at a time. (Excuse the pun.)                                -
532 -                                                                             -
533 - Here's another thought-provoker: What if two black holes were put into a    -
534 - close orbit around each other and sent spinning through the universe. You   -
535 - know, kind of like a bolo. What kind of havoc could they wreak and what     -
536 - forces would be acting in the space between the two Bhs? ...........Pioneer -

539 Pioneer: First, imaginary numbers were considered impractical for about 100
540 years before some one noticed that they are VERY useful in electronics.  So,
541 who knows what this may be useful for.  As for the black holes, try this one!
542 "ordinary" black holes are a singularity (a point).  How about a black hole
543 that is a line connected on itself (a hoop) then the event horizon would be
544 torodial <sp> (a doughnut) shaped.  What forces and what would happen to 
545 something passing throught the hole?
546 
547 Back to the unreals.  The set of unreal numbers is a set of infinite lines
548 in which the set of reals is a subset.  I keep spotting similarities to the
549 fourth dimension.  Unfortunately, I have trouble conceptualizing them, let
550 alone type them out.
551 
552 Back to 4D.  The easiest way for me to visualize 4D is to take 3D and
553 call it a HYPERPOINT (a piont that has infinite magnitude in 3 dimensions).
554 Then the fourth dimension is a hyperline, a series of hyperpoints.  further
555 along the line is the future and on the other side is the past.  Now,
556 what makes up a hyperplane and hyperspace?  Sorry to bring in the 5th and 6th
557 dimensions.
558 BYE                                                                THE DOCTOR

563      O heart trampled on:  why chase a wraith creature?  Why read motives
564 into her gestures, or let your eyes hungrily follow her dusty prints in
565 the path?  For the path leads up into the mountains, a winding, tortuous
566 way, and ends in a sand-carved stairwell where the trees are no more...
567 so turn back, O grief-stricken one, to the forest where you thought the
568 path began.  Wend your way through the tall sighing grasses, and pause to
569 observe the dew in the grasses where she slept, the dew that bears salt...
570 Thence go your way comforted, and look back no longer, and slowly your
571 healing will begin.  Look--your friends await your presence at the Inn!

574   Doctor:
575      What prevents a "hoop" from colapsing into a singularity?
576                                                        The Master
577 <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
578 The answer is elementary:  TIME, the fourth dimension, holds back the hoop's
579 collapse!  				Silence

581 PAM.--Is rape "performed"?
582 PAM. --   Is rape "performed"?  If so, why?   If not, why use that verb?
583 ========================================================================
584 Doctor:  0/0 is of use in the real world. Take Ohm's Law-
585 E=I*R or I=E/R . In a superconductor the resistance is 0.
586 Form a ring of a superconductor, the resistance is zero, the
587 applied voltage is zero. Thus the current is equal to 0/0.
588 What does this mean? It means that the current can have ANY value!
589 	As for the toroidal black hole, they have been studied for
590 some time. "All" you have to do is spin a "normal" black hole at
591 a sizable fraction of lightspeed. It is kept from collapsing by
592 the high spin rate. As for what happens if you go thru the hole
593 -- well, first off the tidal forces would rip you into sub-atomic
594 particles before you got there. But it is thought that the "hole
595 in space-time" (in the center of the torus) would lead to another
596 universe. Unfortunately, theory also says that if it does, then going back
597 thru it WOULDN'T get you back here. Instead, you'd wind up in a
598 THIRD universe. 
599 The black holes orbiting each other would lose energy in the form
600 of gravity waves which would possibly make things rather interesting
601 but would also cause them to spiral into one another.
602 If I find time, I'll put the formulas for tidal forces & black hole
603 decay on line.
