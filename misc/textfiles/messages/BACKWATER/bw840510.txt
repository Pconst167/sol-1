24 The door to the house slowly swings open, yet no one is there. I 
25 am confused at this, for how could it open with out the hand of 
26 the owner doing so? With effort I struggle to get up. Looking in 
27 I see no one. Not knowing what to think, I decide to take it as 
28 an invitation. I can only be thrown out to the elements again if 
29 it is not. Looking about I find that the house is empty. I don't 
30 understand this at all, but now I have an even more pressing 
31 need. Searching quickly I soon find the bathroom. To my 
32 surprize, I find the window broken and laying in pieces upon the 
33 floor. Is this house then indeed empty? I become a bit 
34 frightened at this thought. Have I entered a haunted house? 
35 Relieving the great pressure that had been exerting itself upon 
36 my bladder, I step back out and return to the living room. The 
37 warmth of the house brings me great comfort. Spying a chair, I 
38 ease my poor weary body into it. The warmth overwelms me after 
39 so long a time of the chilling winds and storm filled waters, 
40 and soon I doze off to sleep wondering what has become of the 
41 occupants of the house. In my sleep, my dreams are troubled 
42 greatly with pain, loss, and fear. A great black cloud tries to 
43 cover and choke me. I must struggle to fight it. My sword is 
44 useless against it. It is only by my own thoughts and feelings I 
45 can fight it back. It ebbs and flows in the battle always trying 
46 to overcome me, yet still do I fight it. After awhile, I begin 
47 to realize that it is not me that this cloud is attacking, but 
48 the very house and those who would enter. With a cry of dismay, 
49 I shout "NO! You shall not claim me or this house! Begone! Back 
50 to the foul stench from which you came!" Yet this seemed to only 
51 cause the darkness to redouble its efforts to gain control. From 
52 reserves of strength I know not where, I continue to fight and 
53 redouble my efforts. I cannot give up now, there is too much to loose.

92 PAM: was that last entry of yours the basis for a story, something actual
93 from your past, allegory, an exercise in WR121, or 'other'?
94 Certainly gloomy, whatever the reason.  If nothing else, it served to
95 draw TARN out from his hiding place.

133 The cat looked around. There was a cave mouth on the mountain face nearby.
134 He loped over to investigate. 
135 Suddenly, the cat stopped... then he raised his head and spat. All his fur was
136 erect. He growled around his saber-teeth while backing away slowly.
137 """"""""""""""""""""""""""Green Eyes""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
138 The apprentice was startled. What was wrong with the prairiecat? He 
139 extended his senses towards the cave mouth...
140 Now he understood! Evil, waves of it...
141 He readied a spell. The cat was just about cle{BLINK}ar...
142 Now what? They were standing outside a house... 
143 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE A scream! Quickly they ran thru the door. Since the
144 apprentice's senses had been heightened before the "jump"(?) he could "see" the 
145 presence around the chair. 
146 "Ego te exorciso, in nomine Patris, et Fili, et Spiritus Sancti.
147 Ex ea exi, spiritus impura, in nomine Domini nostri Jesu Christi Fili Mariae."
148 The apprenticed had no idea where the words had come from, but the were
149 apparently QUITE effective!
150 As the figure in the chair straightened, he spoke. "Can we be of assistance
151 to thee?"

201 :************************************************************:
202 Dear Milchar & Traveller:
203 
204 I couldn't help but notice your interest in spells and magic. I
205 hadn't commented until now, primarily because you seemed only 
206 interested in modern forms and practices; I thought you might 
207 laugh at the old-fashioned ways of a professional dragon hunter.
208 
209 Then I thought "what the heck", maybe you'd be interested in 
210 knowing of some of the ancient ways.
211 
212 It was the Roman Pliny, in his thirty-seven volume "Natural 
213 History", that made dragon hunting popular by observing that 
214 dragons had precious jewels inside their heads. Though this 
215 was probably the beginning of dragon hunting as a serious 
216 professional sport it is hardly the only reason to hunt the beastes.
217 
218 The parts of dragons have many mystical and magical properties.
219 It's well known that a dragons' head buried under your house
220 will bring good fortune. If the Inn were to undertake this 
221 basic precaution we'd have far fewer incidents of violence and 
222 tragedy. But, alas, those of the scientific bent are always 
223 slowest to learn.
224 
225 Dragons fat, dried in the sun, will cure ulcers as well as 
226 keep venemous snakes away. An unguent made from the head and 
227 tail of a dragon, the marrow of a lion along with hair from 
228 his mane, the paw of a dog, and foam from the mouth of a
229 victorious race horse will make one invincible. Of course, 
230 you can get the same effect from the proper use of a cognative 
231 transmogrification gun.
232 
233 I won't go on any further, thought there is much more I could 
234 say, because I don't want to take up more than my share of the 
235 disc. I merely ask that in contemplating your spells you give 
236 occassional thought to some of the ancient ways, for sometimes 
237 they are the best.
238 
239                       Grand Dragon Master

242 Dear Mr. MacHinery:
243 
244 Mr. McKane regrets that he cannot accept your offer on account 
245 of his spiritual commitments. Perhaps once his "pay-a-prayer" 
246 monastery chain is established he will be able to offer 
247 service. Until that time he is not taking on any new accounts.
248 
249 Thank you for thinking of McKane enterprises. Hopefully we 
250 will be of service to you in the future.

299 Someone left a cryptogram a while back, it looked like
300 JPEOD YJODO DYPPJ STFGF TUPIV
301 there has been no response on it, and I must admit to not being very
302 knowledgeable about codes; I have been unsuccessful.  Would the author
303 care to give a hint?
304 ????
305 Milchar: I have also been unsuccessful in solving your alpha-group. A hint 
306 there? (this isn't looking too good--"he can dish it out but can't take it").
307 ????
308 I left a sequence problem a while ago (I think it's on drive C now)
309 which went:
310 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 24, 31, 100, ??, 10000, 1111111111111111
311 Since it hasn't been solved, I offer this hint: the numbers are not
312 all of the same base.  (these puzzles seem so easy when one knows the solution).

394 Ah Hah!  ++++Just Solved the Quizmaster's Number Sequence++++
395 The whole series is (as given): 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,20,22,24,31,100,??,
396 1000,1111111111111111
397 The 1000 is NOT correct; it should be 10000! (That hindered progress a little!)
398 The missing number is: <<<< 121 >>>>
399 Reason: All of the above numbers in the sequence are equal to 16 (base ten).
400 The first number, 10, is 16 in base 16, 11 is 16 in base 15, 12 is 16 in base

408 THE FINAL DAY HAD COME, THE INNKEEPER WENT OUT FOR THE FINAL TIME TO
409 GET HIS FAITHFUL STEED. SETTING THE BRIDLE, HE TURNS TO GET THE SADLE, THEN
410 AFTER PAUSING FOR A MOMENT, HE DECIDES NOT. "NO, MY FRIEND TODAY YOU NEED
411 NOT CARRY MY WEIGHT. I WILL INSTEAD WALK BY YOUR SIDE." WITH THAT HE STEPS
412 OFF DOWN THE ROAD. HEADING OVER THE HILL, SOON HE COMES TO THE DEALER WHO
413 HAD AGREED TO THE DESIRED TERMS. TURNING THE REINS OVER TO THE DEALER,
414 HE GIVES ONE LAST PAT TO THE FAITHFUL SERVENTS FLANK, AND TURNS AWAY.
415 THERE BEFORE HIM STOOD HIS NEW STEED. A YOUNG FRESH COLT IN THE PRIME
416 OF CONDITION. JUST NEWLY RELEASED FROM THE BREAKING PENS. A FINE AND
417 POWERFUL STEED THIS WAS. IT MADE THE INNKEEPER SWELL WITH PRIDE TO OWN
418 THIS FINE BEAST. THOUGH HE WAS A BIT CONFUSED ABOUT THE TUBE LEADING
419 FROM THE REAR OF THE ANIMAL TO THE FEEDBAG, THE DEALER SAID IT WAS 
420 SUPPOSE TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ANIMAL. (SOMETHING ABOUT
421 MAKING HIM WANT TO GO FASTER TO GET AWAY FROM THE SMELL...) THERE ARE
422 MANY NEW AND WONDEROUS THINGS ABOUT THIS BEAST THAT IT WILL TAKE THE
423 INNKEEPER A WHILE TO GET USED TO, BUT HE IS PROUD NONE-THE-LESS TO OWN
424 IT. NOW IF HE COULD JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS BUTTON MARKED "TURBO LASER"
425 WAS ALL ABOUT... (THE DEALER HAD INDICATED THAT IT WAS USEFUL DURING
426 TRAFFIC JAMS. NOW WHAT WAS A TRAFFIC JAM???) THE FIVE POINTED STAR ON
427 THE BEASTS NOSE WAS GOOD FOR WARDING OFF EVIL SPRITS AS WELL.

430 Well, Milchar, you do seem to be keeping up with the challenges quite
431 well. One question, however.  Where was the mistake (1000 for 10000)? 
432 I looked back at my entry earlier on this disk, and it is correct.  Was that
433 the bad one, and did you repair it? Or was it my first entry (which has
434 scrolled off the system)?
435 How are you doing on Travellers code?
436 ????
437 Here's a new one.  I admit that this type has always baffled me.
438 
439 Supply a digit for each letter so that the equation is correct.  There is
440 only one set of digits that will work.  A given letter always represents
441 the same digit:
442                     A B C D E
443                     {times} 4
444                     ---------
445                     E D C B A
446 ????
447 Gee, folks, things are getting a bit antisocial around here again.
448 Ninja is wasting the phantom writter,  MAIDS is after Hawthorne,
449 where will it end?  Hawthorne, at least, Seems to be repentant.
450 (I must admit to greatly disliking that boy george crap, but I suppose
451 not everyone is into my puzzles, or the fantasy stories, or religious
452 discussions.)  Hmmm..food for thought, I guess.

457 The Poet was almost content. Belly full, he was half-sleeping in the all-
458 too-rare sunshine, his only concern how to get to know that attractive 
459 young woman in his Fundamentals of Structured Sorcery class. She was the m
460 most beautiful woman he'd seen in a long time (save PAM), and seemed to
461 enjoy the jests the Poet tossed into the class sessions, but was always
462 in the company of a rather fierce-looking fellow who would no doubt take
463 exception to any attentions paid the lady. So ran the semicouscious thoughts
464 in his mind as the afternoon shadows lengthened and began to brush the
465 edge of the cloak on which he lay, eyes closed. How to meet her privately?
466 His reverie was interrupted by a light kick on the sole of his right foot.
467 "Hi. Would you like some ice?"
468 The Poet's eyes reluctantly came open, and he realized it was good that he
469 was already lying down, lest he faint. It was she!

480   In a glade in the forest, far from the inn the sound of bagpipes grew.  
481 First faaint, then increasingly louder, they swelled as if coming from a great
482 distance.  As the sound increased, an observer would have seen the form of
483 the piper slowly coalescing as if from the sunny morning mists.  When he was
484 nearly solid, our observer would have seen him pause in his tune, and, our
485 listner would doubtles miss the faintly muttered comment
486   "Bloody bass ree....."
487 as the piper faded again into insubstantiality.

496 Milchar searches through his portable spell book, looking for a spell he 
497 thought he saw when he packed it.  After several moments of searching, he 
498 brings out a scroll of vellum, inked in a fine hand.  'Dispel Boy George Fans
499 and Rockers' the title read....

551 MIG: TWO POSSIBLITIES FOR YOUR ELECTRIC HEATER TURNING ITSELF INTO A CAMPFIRE.
552 1. A LOOSE CONNECTION; A LOOSE CONNECTION WILL GET VERY HOT PARTICULARLY IN
553 A HEATER WHERE THERE IS A HEAVY ELECTRICAL LOAD. THIS HEAT WOULD CAUSE THINGS
554 TO BURN THAT WEREN'T SUPPOSE TO.
555 2. FRAYED OR PINCHED WIRE. THIS IS LIKE THE LOOSE CONNECTION ABOVE, THE
556 DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN THE LOOSE CONNECTION, THE ELECTRICITY CAN'T GET THRU
557 THE CONENCTION PROPERLY, WHILE IN THE PINCHED WIRE THE ELECTRICITY IS
558 REDIRECTED TO PLACES WHERE IT SHOULDN'T BE AGAIN OVERHEATING THINGS.
559 3. ANOTHER POSSIBLITY THOUGH YOU SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT THIS WASN'T THE
560 CASE, IS BLOCKAGE OF THE THE HEATERS AIRFLOW. IF THERE IS INSUFFICIENT AIR
561 FLOW, THEN THE HEATER WILL OVERHEAT WITH THE SAME RESULTS AGAIN.
562 
563 THEY DO WHAT THEY CAN WITH HEATER MATERIALS, BUT THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT 
564 THEY CAN DO AT A REASONABLE COST TO PREVENT HEATER FIRES.
565 ******************** CISTOP MIKEY *************************************
566 P.S. THE LOOSE CONNECTION PROBLEM IS WHY ALUMINUM WIREING IS NOW ILLEGAL
567 IN HOMES. IT SEEMS THAT AFTER A WHILE THE CONNECTIONS WOULD WORK THEMSELVES
568 LOOSE, HEAT UP, AND CAUSE A FIRE. TSK TSK...
