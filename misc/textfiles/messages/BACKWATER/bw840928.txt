23  
24    Now for a "-able " from The Martian Man!!
25 There are many ways to study science.  No single way is the
26 best for everybody.  We've prepared this book, and others,
27 to introduce you to science a bit at a time.  We could have
28 written a long book with many ideas and many chapters.
29 Instead, we chose to present a few important things for you
30 to think about in each of these books.  And we've done it
31 in such a way that you can do science activities--not just
32 read about them.

36 Quizmaster:  Re: "mans inherently violent nature......games such as 
37 Risk ......Survival Game"  I believe that you will find that there is 
38 a BIG difference between violence and competition.  Do you understand 
39 that difference?

42 Inherently violent nature- yes I can see that. It is not a needed thing
43 like competion, for we all feel a need to "win". Not the same for good
44 old violence, which is both senseless and needless. From the bully down
45 the block to a terrorist hiding in his hole, we find the same pattern:
46 violence being meted out to obtain some sense of control and power over
47 others. Ego, if I'm noy mistaken, has a lot to do with it. What should
48 be done is find a way of suppressing this need without stifling the
49 individual. And iI would prefer to avoid mind control (although that
50 could have some definite advantages, hmmmmmmmmm) as it might bring us all
51 
a little closer to "BIG BROTHER". 
52 MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
53 LAISSEZ-FAIRE;  I STILL AWAIT AN EXPLANATION OF YOUR STATEMENT.

57 MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
58 AH, yes, but man does have an inher-
59 ently violent nature.  How many people
60 have hit something in a blind rage,
61 as a means of expression, rather
62 than a means to dominate?
63    Even in other higher primates
64 we find violent aggression.  Van 
65 Goodall recently documented an actual
66 war between troops of chimps in Africa.
67 Violence and agression seems to be
68 part of the animal in all animals.

81 Quizmaster,
82         I will pick them up today...at a whopping cost of $ 3.58... Lets see
83 it was a 153 and a 166 .... As for the Risk game this Friday...I'll check with
84 the wife and see if she has any objections to rampant destruction being 
85 perpetrated in her dining room. If we need another player....I am sure 
86 I could convince " Black Bart " to join the bloodletting. Provided he has
87 been thoroughly plied with V.O.L. beforehand...and sits facing south...
88 as that seat seems to bring the full effect into play.
89  
90 Laz,
91         Or perhaps you would care to join us on the field of mayhem..? 
92 I also understand you are starting a sequential Risk game...As I recall
93 the gaining of countries is solely dependent on numerical superiority of the
94 attacking forces with the resultant occupying troops being the difference 
95 between the number of offensive & defensive men on the country in question.
96 Is that correct ?. How are normal & Wild cards handled ?
97  
98 L'homme,
99         Ran across an interesting article on Chaos theory in the Economist...
100 of all places...It lends credence to the V.O.L. effect. If we have a game 
101 Friday you can take a look. By the way you didn't say if you had read 
102 Brin's  " The Pratice Effect " ...good book...nice twist
103 So you have retired the mustang.....what was it replaced by ?  300ZX turbo ?
104  
105 MiG,
106         They have neither.... The E/2 was $4.00 more than the figure you spoke
107 of....And they have no idea how much or when either one will cost or be in
108 stock ...Sooooo what now ? are there any substitutes ? alternate sources ?
109  
110 Original sin....an unsubstantiated christian myth which provides a 
111 " raison d'etre " for many christian cults. Using a simplistic cause and 
112 effect relationship to insure loyalty to the faith.....You were born in sin 
113 therefore you must serve the deity so you may be saved......Yawn..yawn..Zzzzzz
114 As for * SIN * itself, I always understood it to be a variation of the 21st 
115 letter of the Hebrew alphabet (SHIN....you know...the Shin bone is connected
116 to the........

120 Alex : NO NO NO!!! I would NEVER retire the Mustang voluntarily. What I think
121  Quizmaster meant was I got a new set of wheels: for my tires. Nice Magnum 500s
122  which are original Mustang sport wheels - no high school craggers or appliance
123  on my car!
124  I have not read TPE. I am just finishing Sun Diver. Is TPE before or after
125  the Star Tide Rising/Sun Diver duo?
126 Quizmaster : I imagine T.i.t.I.C. has totally fooled you? I told you it would
127  be tough. I have found out a couple of nice things. Bench seats and auto
128  trannies *DO* have their respective advantages! Oh and another thing, do you
129  have any vitamin C I can borrow? I seem to have used my supply all up...
130 All : Regarding sin... I hesitate to equate debates on original sin with any-
131  thing that is germane today. I tend to extrapolate the definition of sin to
132  current society, and how our "definition" of sin has had to be modified to
133  cover all the "new" ways we have learned to sin. Maybe we should talk about
134  current sin instead of original sin? It would seem to be a more worthwhile
135  subject.
136 Mikey : Bad news. More errors have cropped up in the dissasm I am helping with.
137  Can I bring a semi-current listing to the next PCS meeting for you to look
138  at? (If you don't mind mixing 'work' with 'relaxation'?)

146 Alex - yes, indeed, I was referring to L'hommes new wheels in the literal
147 sense, not the idiomatic sense.
148 Looks like L'homme may be otherwise occupied Friday.  If he doesn't go,
149 I'll have to drive my car, which I hate to trust on such an extended journey.
150 (Yes, L'homme, that's your only purpose in life - to supply transportation
151 to those without.  And here you always thought it was for your dashing good looks
152 and your devil-may-care, debonair personality.  Sorry, but you had to find
153 out sooner or later).
154 Regarding the IC's, I was under the impression that you had already obtained
155 them for me.  I wasn't implying that you should run out and get them for
156 me.  However, since it seems you already have, thanks.  (I hate obligations. 
157 They are so....obligitory).
158 MiG - it's definite.  Starting Monday, I put away my jeans and don my
159 uncomfortables.  Get back to a 'normal' schedule, and go back to work.
160 It'll be nice to have money again, but I sure wish I didn't have to WORK for it.
161 (behind every silver lining is a cloud....)
162 I may even sink so low as to ride Tri-Mess.  I understand there is a bus
163 which runs from Milwaukie to John's Landing area.  Ah, rush hour; how I

206 HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
207 but L'homme, original sin is so much better than jaded hackneyed sin
208 as you should know since the French are famous for great originality in
209 sinning unlike us Americans who think originals are something to put
210 in a Xerox machine and that the doctrine of original sin has something
211 to do with the copyright laws--it doesn't stop people from engaging in
212 acts of reproduction-it just makes them sneaky about it.
213 HHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Asleep at the wheel HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
214 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
215    The piper was sitting back listening to the conversations flow in the room.
216 Raising a cup of coffee (with REAL cream -- that's what all thee fuss was 
217 about with the cow!) he sipped and tasted the smooth richness fill his mouth.
218 Holding the taste of the freshly-ground, fresh-brewed coffee for a long moment,
219 he felt a pang of pity for all the people in the world that were destroying
220 their stomachs with instant coffee and non-dairy creamer (shudder).  Oh, well,
221 most of them did not know what they were missing, anyway.  Those that drank
222 their coffee light undoubtedly thought that cream was the thick milk that you
223 pay nine prices for at the store.  Given such a choice, non-dairy wasn't all
224 that bad.  Yeilding to temptation (after all it has been nearly three months
225 since cream was last available) the piper left the room, poured another cup
226 of coffee and spooned the thick, rich, yellow cream into it.
227    Also on the subject of food -- I noticed that at Ford's restaurant they
228 are inordanately fond of their unsalted butter -- white, tasteless stuff that
229 reminds me unpleasantly of little squares of rendered lard.  Anybody here 
230 ever seen or tasted REAL butter?  Salted or not, it needs no artificial color,
231 and really has a most pleasant and beguiling taste.  Just thinking about it
232 has put on five more pounds ...sigh.
233   Sorry to have brought up the doctrine of original sin.  I was hoping that
234 someone of the christian persuasion could make a serious case for it (I know,
235 it would be very difficult -- but challenges are what life is all about).
236 Since no one jumped up to the challenge, I'll try to offend someone into a
237 reply --  Have you noticed that commercial religions and life insurance salesmen
238 are really selling the same product -- guilt?

271 example of all, not to offend anyone, is the Catholic church.  They spend the entirety of a young person's education 
272 teaching that person the way to feel good through the church, but through guilt of sins real and imagined, make him feel
273 bad.  Taught to feel good and told to feel bad.  (Thanks Pink Floyd)  Through guilt, more has been done to the human

292 HOW ABOUT SOMETHING A LITTLE CLOSER TO HOME? IN READING THE BOREGONIAN TODAY
293 I FOUND AN ARTICLE CONCERNING THE CONDITIONS THAT RANCHO RAJNEESH AND CO. HAVE
294 BEEN SUBJECTING THE "STREET PEOPLE" TO. IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT FOR
295 A GROUP SO CALLED PEACEFUL, LOVING AND OTHERWISE NICE THEY HAVE TO HAVE GUARD
296 SHACKS AND AUTOMATIC WEAPONS TO FEEL SECURE. THE PREZ DOESN'T GET THE KIND OF 
297 SECURITY THAT THE RAJ' GETS! IT EVEN QUOTED ONE INDIVIDUAL AS SAYING THAT THE
298 WOMEN THERE ARE CARRYING .357S. NOW THAT'S ONE TOUGH TOWN! AND HEY! THE STATE
299 POLICE WANT YOU TO TELL THE COUNTY SHERIFF IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON PASSING BY
300 OR THROUGH THAT NECK OF THE WOODS. WHAT'S AMERICA COMING TO? CAN'T EVEN DRIVE
301 DOWN A PUBLIC ROAD WITHOUT BEING HASSLED BY SOME RELIGOUS FANATICS. MY OWN
302 THEORY IS THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED WITH A DOPE RING. THEY HAVE AN AIRLINE (SUCH
303 AS IT IS) AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD IN MOST MAJOR CITIES. NO SELF RESPECTING
304 CUSTOMS PERSON (SAVE THOSE IN COMMUNIST COUNTRYS) IS GOING TO START A BIG

316  something as crass as a xerox machine? One wonders sometimes what goes
317  on in that head of yours? Perhaps you have been listening to too many
318  people cry in their greasy food about all of their problems. Perhaps you
319  have lost sight of the true meaning of sin? I'm not talking stealing

393 DJJ - YOU HAVE A MESSAGE WAITING ON PCS/CBBS.
394 
395 @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
396 For everyone desperatly in need of a horoscope, here is a general one i found
397   
398 AQUARIUS (JAN. 20-FEB.13)  You have an inventive mind and are inclined to be
399 progressive. You lie a great deal. On the other hand you are inclined to
400 be careless and impractical, causing you to make some mistakes over and over
401 again. People think you are stupid.
402 PISCES (FEB. 14-MAR.20)  You have a vivid imagination and often think you are
403 being followed by the CIA or FBI. You have minor influence over your assoc-
404 iates and people resent you for flaunting your power. you lack confidence and
405 are generally a coward. Pisces people do terrible things to small animals.
406 ARIES (MAR.21-APR.19)  You are the pioneer type and hold most people in con-
407 tempt. You are quick tempered, impatient and scornful of advice. You are not
408 very nice.
409 TAURUS (APR.20-MAY 20)  You are practical and persistent. You have a dogged
410 determination and work like hell. Most people think you are stubborn and bull
411 headed. Taurus people have B.O. and fart a lot.
412 GEMINI (MAY 21-JUNE 20)You are a quick and intelligent thinker. People like
413 you because you are bisexual. However, you are inclined to expect too much
414 for too little. This means you are cheap. Gemini are known for committing
415 incest.
416 CANCER (JUNE 21-JULY 22)  You are sympathetic and understanding to other pe
417 ple's problems. They think you are a sucker. You are always putting things off.
418 That's why you will never make anything of yourself. Most welfare recipients
419 are Cancer people.
420 LEO (JULY 23-AUG.22)  You consider yourself a born leader. Others think you
421 pushy. Most Leo people are bullies. You are vain and dislike honest criticism.
422 Your arrogance is disgusting. Leo people are thieves.
423 VIRGO (AUG.23-SEPT.22)  You are the logical type and hate disorder. This nit-
424 picking is sickening to your friends. You are cold and unemotional and some-
425 times fall asleep while making love. Virgos make good bus drivers.
426 LIBRA (SEPT.23-OCT.22)  You are the artistic type and have a difficult time
427 with reality. If you are a man you are more than likely queer. Chances for 
428 employment and monetary gains are excellent. Most Libra women are good prost-
429 itutes. All Libras have venereal disease.
430 SCORPIO (OCT.23-NOV.21)  You are shrewd in business and cannot be trusted. You
431 will achieve the pinnacle of success because of your total lack of ethics.
432 Most Scorpio people are murdered.
433 SAGITARIUS (NOV.22-DEC.21)  You are optimistic and enthusiastic. You have a
434 reckless tendency to rely on luck since you lack talent. The majority of
435 Sagitarians are drunks or dope fiends. People laugh at you a great deal.
436 CAPRICORN (DEC.22-JAN.19)  Yuo are conservative and afraid of taking risks.
437 You don't do much of anything and are lazy. There has never been a Capricorn
438 of any importance. Capricorns should avoid standing still too long as a dog
439 might think you are a tree and piss on you.

476 BWMS was first put on line as a private message system in 1981. In 1982
477 it was opened to for public use, and has been open for public use since.
478 BWMS consists of a data entry machine built in 1977 by Edge Technology.
479 It has been slightly modified to operate as a BBS. It uses a 8080 CPU
480 with 1K of RAM, and 8K of ROM for the BBS program. There is no operating
481 system used for BWMS, instead BWMS 'is' the operating system. The 
482 program was written in assembler for the 8080 CPU. The disk is formatted
483 for 35 tracks of 18 sectors per track. Each sector holds 128 bytes
484 of data. BWMS uses one sector for each line stored in the system (even
485 if it is blank). With the first sector reserved for system information,
486 this leaves 629 sectors for use by the data, thus the maximum number
487 of lines being 629. BWMS uses a 1771 disk controler, and was one of the
488 first computer designs to do so. As each line of data is entered into
489 the machine, it is saved to disk. Thus when you hit the return key
490 BWMS will go away for a bit while it saves the line on the disk. When
491 you type the control C to get out of the enter mode it goes back to the
492 first sector and saves the number of the last line entered so it can
493 remember where it was. The next time the enter mode is selected, it
494 goes back to the first sector to find out where to continue entering 
495 data.
496 
497 BWMS is open to the public and can be found at (503) 230-xxxx 24hrs a day

516 this is a test.

518 Hello, as I am not often on BWMS, I miss a lot, but was I wrong or
519 did someone refer to DArkover?
520 When were you there? How did you like the weather?
521 What did you buy with the piece of copper wire you swiped from electrical?
522 Tell us your tales of there, we listen.

524 Yes, it seems dark annd cold at first, but you get used to it, when
525 you have a friend. She was tall and very pale, and her hands had 6
526 fingers but we hit it right off.
527 But finally I had to leave.
528 I left for New Chicago , and she went back into the
529 forest.
530 On the lasat day, she introduced me to her brother, Immni.

536 As morning came after midsummer's day, and we watched the sun light
537 up the peak of high Kimbi, we heard  a ship roar off from the spaceport.
538 Immni looked far, far away, and said "It wasn't always like this. I
539 cringe every time I hear a ship roar off."
540    "Why?"
541    "The roar scares me, I fear it will end. It once was safer to go, the
542 matrix never failed."
543    "Matrix? Do you mena like the landing gtridrid that supplyes power to 
544 the ascending ships on New VCChicago?"
545    "I say too much. Yes, much like the landing grids, but far better."
546    "Brother, dear, do you still yearn for space? Will you never be 
547 satisfied with what you have?"
548    "No, I will ever yearn. I have seen better."
549    "you have? They are going to build a grid here, to serve the larger
550 ships that will be going through. This will be the most modern port
551 in the galaxy."
552    "Yes, but not the best. I hate to see foreigners running it."
553    "What could be better?"
