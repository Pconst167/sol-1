58 As I sit in my chamber once more, I ponder on the aspect of the land.
59 Is the land bright or is it dark? Is the land rich or is it poor?
60 Is the land wild or is it tame? Is the land hot or is it cold?
61 As I consider these things I find the answer in the words that have
62 been. The land has both its light and dark sides. At night the land
63 is dark and menacing, but this turns to normalcy come the light of 
64 day. Of the day we know little as most of its inhabitants disappear
65 or return to seclusion. The night is full of magic and dreams. The 
66 land is often shrouded with fog at night, but this disipates come the 
67 morning sun. There has been littl said of the value of the land, of
68 its people and homes. Yet there are merchants there so it would seem
69 to have at least some degree of civilization and prosperity. The land
70 is not hot, yet it is not extremly cold, but dank and wet though some
71 relief does come with the sun. As is normal with most lands of this
72 sort it is thought that there is drier land to the east past the mountain
73 range. There is an ocean to the west the breadth is unknown and gives
74 cause for many an adventure. To the north is more land of the same as
75 this, while futher still we find the cold glaciers of ice. To the far
76 south it is said there is a land of wonderous people and things. Of
77 machines that talk and great silver birds fill the sky. Of the details
78 of our current abode we still have much to learn. How may the outlands
79 be reached? What of towns and holds? Who are the people of our land?
80 What are the proffesions to which they belong. Is there currency?
81 Is there barter? Theft? Charity? Desperation? Sorrow? Hate? Love?
82 Peace? War? Petstilence? Famine? Prosperity? Death? Birth? Serenity?
83 What of its rulers what is thier nature are they strong or weak?
84 Despicable or kind? Some other considerations of the land we know
85 are that it contains strange and wonderous things to behold. It has 
86 gosts and goblens, are they good or bad? It has madmen and devout men.
87 What is thier nature? Of mysterious people it has no lack, and blessing
88 of blessings it has dragons of intellegence and beauty (well at least
89 one we know of) are there others of fantisies kind?
90 Of me you know little, yet you know much. I am a man in search of his
91 dream often driven to the edge of madness in desperation. All to often 
92 that which I seek eludes me. I love the land in which I live and call
93 it my own, yet it is sometimes stange to me still.  I believe
94 in myself and in the dream that I seek, and I believe that someday I
95 will find my hearts desire. For until then I remain as always

99   A weaving is what I see; a fragile fabric of colours to delight is taking
100 shape among the hands of a people turned inward:  'Come, let us build for
101 ourselves a city and also a tower with its top in the heavens ...'  What
102 sort of a land will it prove to be, this place of refuge for the lonely and
103 aloof?  Before it is even barely formed, a sinister side is revealed--what
104 sort of start is that?!--yet your creative fingers outline the beauty of 
105 dewdrops & sunshine, graceful creatures & lush greenery ... You would next

119 impatient for its wonderous stories to be told. As I consider the writtings
120 that have occured so far, I find it but a teasing of that which may be. Let
121 us go forth and tell a story that is glorious to behold. For the land it is

163 I speak to you of Leo the bull. Though stubborn he is kind and full
164 of love. Though his physical strength is not great, his intelligence
165 and concentrantion are second to none. He is an achiever. Leo's story
166 is one of boldness and adventure for he seeks a treasure of great joy.
167 Leo's story begins in the Backwater tavern as he crosses the threshold
168 the tavern is near empty for it is early and most of the patrons are
169 still at work. He steps up the to bar and calls for a drink. From my 
170 table I watch him for a while, then he looks my way. I wave to him and
171 ask him to join me, for I am lonely and would have company in the hopes 
172 that it would ease my depression. Leo shrugs his shoulders and says
173 "Why not." He crosses to my table and sits across from me. He tells me
174 that his name is Leo, and I tell him that mine is

181 AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT...
182       a restaurant review
183 	              ******   Papa Haydn   ******
184    I've been meaning to try this small establishment for some time, but
185 never seemed to have a chance.   As it turned out, this was a mistake!
186 I should have stopped there a long time ago.
187    The specialty is dessert!  As a consequence, the dinner entrees are
188 light, with delightful seafood dishes and several different pasta items.
189 There is a good selection of Oregon wines, premium beers, varied coffees
190 and teas.  For lunch, you may choose from sandwiches and quiches.
191    Before you eat anything, stop at the dessert case.  These tortes,
192 cheesecakes, and other outrageous morsels may make you decide to forego
193 the other features of the menu.  Plan ahead!  All of these delicious 
194 and beautiful desserts are prepared in the bakery on the second floor.
195 They bring the goodies down the stairs and in the front door right past
196 the patrons tables.  This is foul play, indeed.
197    On a Friday or Saturday, there may be more people waiting than there
198 are already seated.  This is a small place.  Come early or late.  Hours
199 are 11:30 to 11 Tuesday through Thursday and 11:30 to Midnight on 
200 Friday and Saturday.  Location is on SE Milwaukie Ave between McLoughlin
201 and Bybee in the Westmoreland district (right next to the Yukon Tavern).

206    Oh, people of this land:  listen.  Rainbows are not built of concrete! 
207 The nature of it eludes you even yet:  I implore you, do not attach ordinary
208 elements like the debauchery of taverns & unhappy faces to our land!  Do you
209 turn inward so far that your own depression is all you see, & you seek that
210 artificial euphoria to stave it off?  Rather, seek the secret person in the
211 heart of others, and there you will find delight & adventure!  It is even 
212 as the sage has spoken:  "Counsel in the heart of a man is as deep waters,
213 but the man of discernment is one that will draw it up."  The magic of this
214 place is not that of everyday incidents, or of imaginary people; it is the
215 real eyes that read this screen, and the real smile that quirks at the corner
216 of your mouth--yes, I see it!--and its those fingers that reach eagerly for
217 the keyboard to answer, to share a little more of whats inside.  This girl
218 has only seen two decades, but by listening has reached many a yearning
219 heart...So take a lesson and don't tell tales.  Communicate instead!

221 Leo the bull tells me of his quest, a tale of fine interest.
222 I am in search of a sorceress of great renoun, for she posseses 
223 the venom I need to complete my recipe for life everlasting.
224 I have searched for many years for this one of great power. 
225 I have heard that I may possibly find her here abouts. Have you
226 heard of a great sorceress of these parts? I answer that I have not.
227 She is said to have great powers and is quite proficient at the art
228 of shape change. Her favorite form is that of a dragon, though see 
229 has been known to take the form of a cat or other forms. One form
230 that she can take is that of a scorpion whence the venom is obtained.
231 This is most interesting I think as he tells me this story, and I 
232 wonder if he speaks of the one known as the Dragon Lady.

310 Viewed close at hand, the river was a sandsucking, roiling, pugnacious
311 terror, a raucous, roistering flood of water that chewed its way down
312 across the land. Strange that it would have this apearence for from
313 a distance it appeared as smooth as a ribbon of yellow gold, a beautiful
314 and relaxed stream of blisful water. Standing at the bridge above this 
315 turbulent flow I speak once more to the one who calls himself Leo the

317 lady. I would recommend that you begin your search for her if that is

355 As of the one who calls himself the beleiver, he is but a passing
356 acquaintance who directed me to this Inn of intrigue. Of him I know
357 little, and if the truth be known I would keep it that way, for he
358 is a solitary and very depressive soul, and I would as soon not
359 keep company with such as he.

364 one and all. I return to my thoughts and dreams for there am I

414 Of what value is the life of the immortal stones? They watch yet they
415 do not see. They listen yet they do not hear. They are touched yet 
416 they do not feel. No that form is but a hollowness and is worst then
417 death. I know the way I but seek the means to trod the path. The sorceresses
418 venom is the means I seek, and I would have nought else. For anything
419 less would be of a fate worst then death itself.

436 Leo the Bull------r:
437 Who has told thee of immortality? Do you not see
438 that only things that do not change live forever?
439 Would you then feel my sting and the fire of my
440 venom coursing through your veins?
441 Would you have the immortality of DEATH?
442 >>>>>>>>>>>>>SCORPION<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
443 Nay, the immortallity of the stones is but an overly long extension
444 of a poor existance. It is not immortallity, but rather a suspension
445 of animation. In time death even comes to those of the stone, for
446 they cannot meet the changing winds of time and are soon removed
447 from this frame of existance. Only those who can change to meet the
448 environment that exists may enjoy the life everlasting. Change is life
449 and life is change! The stagnation of being is but the beginning of the
450 end. For the rot of decay but waits for the stagnation to begin its
451 evil deed. The venom of the scorpion is but a catalyst for the recipe 
452 of change. It brings danger which carries opportunity and change
453 in its wake. Death is but the last resignation to the changing environment
454 it is the end in this frame of existance, not the begining.
455 I search for she who will fight at my back against the danger that
456 wells forth  so that we may encounter the changing opportunities of 
457 time everlasting. This then is the immortality I seek.

484 I am the THOUGHT MASTER and you have not been into the mind of
485 God. If you have been into the mind of God you would find the
486 the truth of all matter. You are but mere childern in the search
487 for the truth in a distant past. God has all knowledge and matter
488 revealed to a few who have searched for Him and those who have 
489 found Him have become the masters of thought. Guiding the thoughts
490 of the mind to explore the vast space of matter and the reality
491 of that which exists beyond the internal self is of more satisfaction
492 than the mere prose of the rhyme of words which have no substance.
493 The BELIEVER has come close to touching God, however he is close
494 to the reality of the truth. Deep inside the BELIEVER is a strong
495 desire to know the mind of God however, he only finds the DRAGON
496 LADY in his path. Into the deep. Into the vast space of reality.
497 Yes, there is truth in knowledge. In the black box of existance
498 if the image of the form of all things. Look! Over there! Ah, the
499 sight of a bridge. A smooth surface reflecting the sun's light.
500 Beyond the reality of life there lies a road which is royal only
501 to those who have searched. Ah, the royal path of life. A path 
502 only for the ones who have long been searching for a better way
503 of life. In the life following the royal path is a counselor
504 greater  and more understanding than any who claim to profess
505 their discipline. Ah, if all space is infinate, then no space
506 is space at all.  Nonsense says the philosopher.
507 Ah, but the rabbi says he knows that I know that I have found the
508 truth.

540 most certainly aware. It is but a sham, five years before did I view
541 my countenance in this mirror of beginings. It contains nought, but the
542 darkness and chaos that which is not. It was only because of my good
543 fortune that I did not gaze directly in this mirror, for those that do
544 are instantly turned to stone. Never to be heared from again. That which
545 I seek is the true life everlasting the means to obtain the completness
546 of the body of balance. For only with this counter can the changing flow
547 of life be met. No one can stand alone against the flow.
