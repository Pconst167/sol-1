21 There are certain things one must continually ignore....
22 Anyway...
23 DV: Hmm.  I wasn't aware that I was a twit.  In fact, a few people have
24 talked to me about how 'we can get the twits.'  And old, faithful user you
25 may be, but I would be also if my hardware were so faithful.  I first called
26 BWMS on Dec. 28, 1983 at 17:25-17:43.  I have been off and on since then.
27 I started calling myself STARPATH on Dec. 19, 1983.  I went off after a
28 (wait, that was 1984.)  My modom went out , (did this take that?  oh no!)
29 (1984)... and then my modom went out.  I had to wait until 8/3/85, then I
30 went back on-line for a month and a half.  Finally, I started up again in
31 Feb. of this year.  I only comment on what I see here, or I bring up
32 something that will not offend anyone.  If you have a complaint, tell it to
33 me, don't just sit there and name call.
34 Moshe Freinberg:  I wasn't aware that Milchar was a twit, either.
35 Delta five:  Interesting, please go on with your story.
36 All: sorry about those line feeds, but something happened and I couldn't
37 control it.

70 You're right, Cistop, WAIT ON seems 'cleaner' than DELAY, but it certainly seems slower!  Probably better for codes, though,
71 when it absolutely, positively has to get there intact.  However, a multitude of methods is much better than a dearth! 020202

74 What kind of computer screen is this set up for?  125 col? Hmmm...
75     Sorry about the manner of my last message.  Heres the scoop (I hate cliche's, but oh well...)
76     aAnyway, twice now, I have hit a certain key by mistake that did that.  (If it is not there now, then thank cistop for
77 ridding us of it.)  I am using an inferior modom prog. right now that wants to clear the screen instead of deleting.  Sorry,
78 Cistop, for any trouble caused.  I am going to use another program from now on...

96 .And Farley, to his surprise, dfound Garret instead.
97 Few inside the organization had not heard of James Garret, NET's weapons
98 expert.  He could use anything from a Bowie knife to tsmall firearms to any
99 type of rifle you care to name, and was good with ALL of them.  Unfortunately,
100 James had this rather distressing habit of ignoring rules just so he could
101 use his talents as much as possible.
102 Well, definitely not a Parity, Farley thought, but perhaps he can be useful.
103 James stopped firing at the targets (he had put several dozen bull's-s-eyes in
104 each one) and turned to see Farley just inside the sound-proof door, holding
105 his hands over his ears.
106 "Eugene!  Hey, come down to squeeze off a few, did you?"
107 James always made Farley nervous, but he was determined not to let James know
108 it.  "Nah.  Came to offer you a little fun, James."
109 James paused a bit.  "Private job?  Not for NET?"
110 James would detect a lie- at least from Farley, who couldn't lie well.  He
111 answered, "Yeah.  Private."
112 James considered this., not worrying about what the 'fun' consisted of, just
113 that NET didn't know about it.  "Won't Ian be peeved?"
114 Farley knew jexactly how to answer this.  He smiled a little, and said "Yes."
115 James broke into a grin.  "Sounds swell so far.  Let's go talk about it over
116 a brew."

121 Do you agent-types have a plot ready? Not to complain (I like watching codes of
122 various levels being spat about, and reading three different stories at once,
123 all with the same characters) But it does seem strange. Don't you think?

138 ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
139 Good morning to all of you mothers out there, I hope you have scheduled indoor
140 activities for the youngsters today being the third straight day of fallout over
141 the pacific northwest. For the next few days, pretend that you're vacationing in
142 Mexico, don't eat the food, don't drink the water, and stay out of the sun.
143 The weathermen said it was going to rain today which tends to make me
144 wonder... what in the he** has been falling out of the sky? It must be a pigment
145 of my imagination. I was over at Larry's sports center today and there was a
146 sale on lead waders which should thin the fishing crowd.  Have a wonderful day,
147 and remember the old Russian proverb, if you nuke 'em, Barri 'em.
148 
149 ??????????????????????????????????????? bondo ???????????????????????????????????
150 The stillness inside the small office was broken only by the howl of the wind, as it whistled and moaned through the
151 cavernous hangar. The rain had stopped falling;the sky was clear, the air very cold. A million stars studded the inky
152 purple sky as the shortening golden rays of the arctic sun withdrew,fingerlike, their color from the deserted airfield.
153 
154    Five men sat on folding chairs, each glancing occasionally at the door to the communications room. Waiting. The 
155 seconds ticked by, becoming minutes, becoming quarter-hours. Waiting...
156 Suddenly, expectedly, the door opened.The bull of a man called Delta Five emerged. The tears were dried, his compo
157 sure regained. He was in control. He strode purposefully to the refrigerator, and, extracting a can of Budweiser, 
158 drank deeply. Stepping to the center of the room, he addressed the five waiting men.
159    The message has been decoded. The sender, as you know, my father, is dead. He faltered, his voice choked with 
160 emotion, then quickly continued. We are all here because of one man. Leroy McKane. We thought we knew a great deal 
161 about him-and we do- but-there is one thing we didn't know. Something big. McKane had dropped out of sight after his
162 alleged death in Oklahoma. Later a message was intercepted. From-of all places-a sausage factory in France. This led
163 us to Central America, and to McKane. He was operating a home for 'wayward' boys. What we didn't know about is the
164 underground fifteen million dollar research center. Lasers, gentlemen. And Masers. Big ones. Capable of bringing down
165 an aircraft. A satellite. A missle. Star wars rechnology. 
166 An audible gasp filled the room, and Lou passed out cans of Budweiser to dry throated men.
167 Delta continued;"This afternoon, a Soviet Ilyuhshan III cargo plane-a "civillian" plane was dispached from Leningrad
168 to Managua, Nicaragua. The cover for this is the withdrawl of Soviet troops from Central America"
169 "One of these lasers is ready for field testing, and is to be flown west across the Pacific, then north of Japan, 
170 and finally west into Eastern Siberia. We don't know where-possibly Yakutsk" 
171 He paused for a moment, letting it sink in, then continued. "The Pentagon can do nothing-an unarmed civilian aircraft
172 over international waters the entire flight. *WE* can. We will. We must"
173 
174    Parity stood up and took charge. "Delta is right. His voice rising in volume, as the howling of the Arctic wind
175 intensified. "We have little time. I suggest we take stock-of what we have to work with, of our collective skills:
176    Lou disappeared into the hangar and returned dragging a large chalkboard, setting it in place, and Parity began
177 drawing lines across the surface. The others watched-murmuring in low voices, fascinated. Across the top each man 
178 was listed, and across the left side were drawn symbols-an aircraft, a round bomb with "sputtering" fuse.A gun,etc.
179 In the square across from the scetch of the plane, and below his and Delta's name, he drew an X.
180 "OK. Two of us can fly..."
181 He was interrupted by Leo;George Kellermans friend. "Make that three. I flew Hueys in Nam, and for WNBC News in New
182 York. I also speak fluent Spanish, and a little Russian..."
183    One by one, each man revealed his useful skills, and the board was soon covered with X,s. Fellows spoke fluent 
184 Russian. Lou could fix just about anything mechanical, and was experienced in the manufacture and use of explosives.
185 They all could handle firearms.
186 A plan was quickly drawn up, and each man knew what to do. Parity and Fellows were in the comm room, poring over 
187 Jepsen manuals, sending comm-link messages to NET Central, enlisting aid, and printing out details to be researched.
188    Lou was in the hangar making Plastique and from boiling gasoline and soap powder, Napalm. Leo-using hastily made
189 stencils and spray cans, was "decorating" the old DC-3. Everyone was busy. The hours passed. No one saw the thin 
190 streak of black smoke arching across the Northern sky...
191 To be continued. [*=*] DELTA FIVE [*=*]

245         Ada arrived at work at the usual time. She checked up the high
246 priority operations and picked the latest progress reports on her way to
247 her desk. She sorted out the most important and went through the 
248 connecting door to Ian's office.
249         Odd, he wasn't in yet. He was usually hard at work by now.
250         Wait. There's an envelope in the middle of his desk. 
251         No adress and not sealed. VERY strange she thought. Opening it 
252 she scanned the single page inside.
253         She ran out into the outer office and unlocked a file cabinet.
254 "Oh my God! He's got them all...."
255 	She picked up the phone and dialed. "Security. This is Ada Lovelace.
256 ID <censored>. Condition Blue 9. Repeat Blue 9. The director's status
257 is unknown but until further notice he is to be assumed to be an enemy
258 agent. Termination is NOT allowed. Move it!"
259         She dialed again and repeated the ID procedure. "Cryptography.
260 Do you have any codes that have not been approved by Mr. Machinery yet? 
261 If so send them up & prepare to issue them as soon as the commitee makes
262 a decision. All current codes are to be considered compromised."
263         She drew herself together and made a final call. This call was
264 apparently an external call as she looked up a number and attached a
265 scrambler to the phone.
266         "Sir, when I came in I found Mr. Machinery's resignation on his
267 desk. He's taken all his files. He refered to them as 'insurance' in his
268 letter."
269         "Yes, I've notified Security and Crypto sections....."

286 "there have been increases in comset

288 alone the increase is 940 percent,"
289     the sweaty cryptoanalyst let his
290 shoulders stoop. he took a drag from
291 his roll of nicotine and snubbed it out
292 on the desk. this recent activity had
293 started him smoking again.
294     coming from a pepsi machine down
295 the hall, an analyst tried to pep him
296 up. he spoke in an accent that could
297 have broken flourescent rods.

326     "Holy bovine excretions! Fellows, look at this." Parity handed Fellows the latest COMSET decode. Fellows' eyes
327 traced across the thermal paper as he read the hot-off-the-press message. His look of surprise was replaced by one of
328 disbelief as he placed the message in the destruction bin.
329     "Resigned? Ada taking over? What in Hell is happening at HQ? We leave for a week and the place falls apart Parity."
330     Parity sighed. Fellows was up to his old tricks. "Humor is not appreciated at the moment Fellows. This is serious. 
331 We may poke fun at Ian's expense sometimes, but he is a damn good director and he has always kept us clear of the
332 committee's wrath. To find out he is missing, with an armload of important papers is more than a little disconcerting.
333 Ada's got a tough job. We need HQ resources right now. This could not have happened at a worse time."
334     "Exactly Parity." Fellows smiled and sat down next to the table that held the COMSET. "Ian's timing is rotten. He knows
335 we are on an important mission with DV. He knows the rumors about McKane. He is the key to coordinating all the branches of
336 NET, and NOW he has vanished. It's mighty suspicious Parity. That little voice inside me is saying 'hit the deck, because
337 SOMETHING is about to hit the fan.'"
338     "I know what you mean. OK, let's tell DV and the others what's up at HQ and see how they want to proceed. We have most 
339 of the information we need to carry out our plan, but, crap, we need that additional coordination!"
340     "Let's brake the news gently. Come on, we can't sit around in the radio shack all day."
341     "Right Fellows, right. I just hope they don't kill the messengers."

355 NET: you know, to an outsider, all this code must be even worse than a twit attack.  At least with twit entries you
356 can ridicule the entry.  All this code though is just garbage to the vast majority of users.  Maybe one of the many
357 unused boards on rtable?  (I'm doubtful about the 253-xxxx number someone mentioned - when I called it a human

398 Washington, D.C. Friday 02:03
399    Once again, the same group of men filed quietly into the Oval Office. They took their places in front of the dedk.
400 The president, seated behind the broad expanse of polished Mahogany, held a single sheet of paper in his hand. Before
401 him lay the opened envelope stamped "EYES ONLY". His soft spoken manner, the one of public appearances and press con
402 ferences was gone. He spoke sharply, demanding answers. "Mr. Secretary, how do you suggest we handle this?"
403 "I suggest we do nothing. Six men-some of the best there are, are preparing to move. They can handle it. At most, 
404 we might provide a little fire power..."The president interrupted;"The Albanian?" "We don't know where he is. If any
405 one does, it would be Parity. No doubt he has made contact. At least tried"
406 "Anyone else?..." The meeting was over, and the statesmen filed from the room, except for the Secretary of State. 
407 It was 2:27 AM. The President picked up the yellow telephone...
408 
409 Juneau, Alaska. Thursday. 11:27.
410 George Kellerman had finished his work, and made his way to the hangar where Lou and Leo were wrapping up theirs. 
411 "Parity wants to see us in the office"...  "We have a flight plan, and alternatives. NET has gotten us clearance direct-
412 ly to Managua. Red Cross supplies. As we approach the airport, we drop below radar, and skim the trees East for 350
413 miles. There is an open area where we can set down, if our intelligence is right." He paused, loking at his map. 
414 "Flying time, given our load, winds aloft, and some fine tuning by Lou, here, is 14 hours.According to NET, a half 
415 hour less than it will take the truck-that carries the Laser-to reach the airstrip. We will have a two mile hike 
416 through the jungle to the road, where we will intercept and take the vehicle."
417 Fellows broke in;"There's been some trouble at NET. McHinery has vanished, along with some files. We don't know how
418 that affects us, but it's too late to worry. It's time to go."
419 The others finished their reports, the last of the supplies were loaded-which, oddly enough, included peices of wreck-
420 age from a long dead airplane. A few minutes later, the red and white Dakota lifted off the runway, and into the night..

450 rather boring to look at.  It would be appreciated if you would choose another
451 board for your cyphers, one that you could leave it in a bullitin that could be

476 SORRYS ABOUT MY LONG ABSENCE, I HAVEN'T BEEN ON BW FOR A WHILE
477 INFA FACT, SEEINGS HOW I GO BACK TO JANUARY 1984, I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL
478 USER OF THIS SYSTEM ALMOST AS LONG AS A LOT OF YOU OUT THERE.
479 IT HAS BEEN GREAT READING THE NEW PEOPLE SINCE MY LAST VISIT....HMMMM
480 LET'S SEE,....THAT WOULD BE AROUND TEN MONTHS AGO I THINK.
481 WHAT IS REALLY SAD IS THAT OF ALL THE TERM PROGRAMS TO USE ON MY VISIT
482 BACK, I PICKED A MOST IDIOTIC COLOR BOARD TERM PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T EV
483 EVEN ALLOW ONE TO SEND CAPITAL LETTERS, SORT OF MAKES ME LOOK SEMI-
484 MONGOLOID. FOR ANY OF YOU OUT THERE THAT REMEMBERS THOR, HELLO TO YOU 
485 YOU AND KEEP UP THE GOOD STORIES AND ENTRIES. IF ANY OF YOU '09'OL
486 'OLD TIMERS' ARE OUT THERE, HOW ABOUT FILLING ME IN ON WHAT HAPPENED
487 TO THE FOLLOWING SYSTEMS[:'Q', GALLIFREY,TANIS, HORIZON, M.A.D.,ELECTR
488 ELECTRIC ARC AND BEE COLOR?
489 I REALIZE THAT I HAVE SORT OF A 'RIP VAN WINDKLE' USER BUT COULD
490 THEY HAVE ALL DISAPPEARED SO AUQUICKLY? THERE WERE SOME GREAT
491 WRITERS ON THOSE PBOARDS AND I MISS SEEING THEIR PROSE AND PENS.
492 IF KATHYD  (ADAKA:COOKIE CORUMBLER) IS ALIVE AND WELL, THOR SAYS 
493 A SPECIAL HELLO AND ASK WHERE HE CAN VISIT TO READ THOSE GREAT
494 TALES.
495 WELL, I WIL L GIVE UP THIS TIME SLOT TO THOSE OF NEED
496 AND BID FAREWELL FOR A DAY OR SO.
497 HOPE TO SEE A LOT MORE E-N-G-L-SI-S-H ON THIS BOARD AS I ALSO 
498 HAVE LOST MY 'CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT' DECODER RING AND FEEL MORE
499 THAN LOST WHEN THE SCRIBBLE SCROLLS BUP MY SCREEN.

514 It didn't take long for Farley to notice his COMSET was madly flashing a
515 "transmission received" signal light, once he returned to his carith James.
516 He quickly tapped a sequence of keys, and stepped back as the COMSET spewed
517 forth with page upon page of communincations.
518 Both agents were puzzled.  This much code traffic meant trouble, a lot of it-
519 what?  Eugene sifted through the growing stack of thermal paper.
520 'NET agents not otherwise assigned are to report to....for new orders  
521 concerning the search for Mr. MacHinery...'
522 James emitted a low whistle, paused, then laughed.  "Guess Ian won't be
523 peeved anymore, ay, Farley?"
524 Farley wasn't in a laughing mood.  AGAIN his dream must wait... a little more.
525 At first opprotunity, though-
526 "C'mon, Eugene, let's go.  We've gotta report in."

529 Congrats, Leonard!  Having gone from production to programming myself, I can
530 appreciate your excitement.  Does this mean you are no longer an assembly-line
531 flunky, but a full-fledged MS-DOSser?  (This is the job you had part time a
532 while back, right?)  Imagine - if there is also a corresponing raise in pay,
533 you can join the real world and get something ibm compatible! (T1000/1200, 
534 of course :-) ). [then you could use SQ/UNSQ / ARC ]. Anyway, way to go.

543 For a moment I thought I recognized an old message sender. If so, my warmest
544 greetings and salutations. If anyone can leave me a note with bbs phone 
545 numbers of the boards mentioned, I would be much appreciated. I am very
546 much interested in the type of boards that allow line entries for common
547 storyline and message bases.
548 THOR hopes that the 'Cookie Crumbler' is happy and well!
