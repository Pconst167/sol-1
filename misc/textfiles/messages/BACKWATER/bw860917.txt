58    It is obvious that the first few hundred lines of this disk were placed
59 by people who enjoy perverting an otherwise friendly and nice place. I,
60 for one, am indignant about this. Gratuitous death and intimacy are
61 obnoxious. Pranks are just stupid. In both cases, they were rude.
62    Why did they place those things here? The Story Teller has put another
63 story up here. One in which the Cistop and a friend are murdered. He, or
64 she, used their names as characters, and then had them slaughtered.
65 Whoever it is that placed those two stories up, nurtures a hatred for this

66 system. Causing me to wonder why the Story Teller has stayed around for
67 these months.
68    The lines following that story were filled with congratulations for the
69 Story Teller, and a prank about the Piper. Understanding these lines is a
70 difficult task. Either the Story Teller wrote hundreds of lines of
71 commentary, or a central terminal was left open for using BackWater. At a
72 gathering of sorts.
73    Whatever the case, one thing is clear. The one way these people are
74 going to be found out, is the one way they can enjoy themselves. By
75 entering more lines. Leaving unwipable, very tracible clues. Which they
76 will do, over the space of time.
77    It's something to think about. Then again, it might be something you
78 want to completely forget.

86 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
87      So I'm filling the catsup bottles at the end of the night, and I'm
88 listening to the radio Mike has stuck up on top of the movable panel in the
89 ceiling, when the door opens and one of them walks in.  I know right away it's
90 one of them - no chance to make a mistake about that - even though it's got on
91 a nice-cut suit and a brim hat like Humphrey Bogart used to wear in
92 Casablanca.  But there's nobody with it, no professor from the college or
93 government men like on the TV show from the college or even any students. 
94 It's all alone.  And we're a long way out on the highway from the college.
95      It stands in the doorway, blinking a little, with rain dripping off its
96 hat.  Kathy, who's supposed to be cleaning the coffee machine behind the
97 counter freezes and stares with one hand still holding the used filter up in
98 the air like she's never going to move again.  Just then Mike calls out from
99 the kitchen, "Hey, Kathy, you ask anybody who won the trifecta?" and she
100 doesn't even answer him.  Just goes on staring with her mouth open like she's
101 thinking of screaming but forgot how.  And the old couple in the corner booth,
102 the only ones left from the crowd after the movie got out, stop chewing their
103 chocolate cream pie and stare, too.  Kathy closes her mouth and opens it
104 again, and a noise comes out like "Uh-errrgh. . . ."
105      Well, that made me annoyed.  Maybe she tried to say "ugh" and maybe she
106 didn't, but here it is standing in the doorway with rain falling around it in
107 little drops and we're staring like it's a clothes dummy and not a customer. 
108 So I think that's not right and maybe we're even making it feel a little bad. 
109 I wouldn't like Kathy staring at me like that, and I dry my hands on my towel
110 and go over.
111      "Yes, sir, can I help you?" I say.
112      "Table for one," it says, like Mike's was some nice steak house in town. 
113 But I suppose that's the kind of place the govenment people mostly take them
114 to.  And besides, its voice is polite and easy to understand, with a sort of
115 accent but not as bad as some we get from the college.  I can tell what it's
116 saying.  I lead him to a booth in the corner opposite the old couple, who come
117 in every Friday night and haven't left a tip yet.
118      He sits down slowly.  I notice he keeps his hands on his lap, but I can't
119 tell if that's because he doesn't know what to do with them or because he
120 thinks I won't want to see them.  But I've seen the closeups on TV - they
121 don't looks so weird to me like they do to some.  Mike says they make his
122 stomach turn, but I can't see it.  You'd think he'd of seen worse meat in
123 Vietnam.  He talks enough like he did, on and on, and sometimes we even
124 believe him.
125      I say, "Coffee, sir?"
126      He makes a sort of movement with his eyes.  I can't tell what the
127 movement means, but he says in that polite voice, "No, thank you.  I am unable
128 to drink coffee," and I think that's a good thing, because I suddenly remember
129 that Kathy's got the filter out.  But then he says, "May I have a green salad,
130 please?  With no dressing, please."

141 Mr. Day:  May I inquire as to why everything I enter -no matter what it pertains to-
142 is deleted?  I feel I have done nothing wrong,  my last message was even an apology
143 to everybody for continuing this stupid little game that 555 started.  I feel that
144 you are being extremely unfair to me for not letting me post.  At least let me take
145 this subject off of your board.  Let me tell 555 to move this discussion (if he wants
146 to continue) send my mail to me on Parrot (253-xxxx) so we can stop mis-using this 
147 fine board of yours, I myself would like to see BW back to the days of old without 
148 the many childish influences.  At least school has taken the "children" out for 
149 another 8 or 9 months.  After you read this could you delete this as it really has 
150 nothing to do with anybody else?  (Except possibly to tell 555 where to call)

185 sounds like a line from a country western song. I won't subject you to my 
186 opinions about country western songs. Lovelorn: try to tone the cliches. Love
187 is overrated and talked about entirely too much as it is. Let's not perpetuate 
188 this ridiculous mystique about the fulfillment of basic human lust. There is no
189 real love but self love, need for security, or lust. Humans are selfish 
190 creatures. Love is giving. Contradictions Ahoy!

197 And lunatics are so full of self-serving contradictory rhetoric that I find
198 it very difficult to keep my cookies. Humans are selfish creatures? When seen
199 through your eyes they are. Fortunately for the rest of us creatures, these
200 feelings of persecution and self-doubt you wear on your shoulder are not
201 shared. How dare you make such accusations. Your own moniker indicates a
202 lack of understanding and the absence of reality from your world. But does
203 that stop you from making gross generalizations of psycho-babble examinations
204 regarding human emotions.
205 A famous author once wrote, through the words of a great hero, 'There is no
206 such thing as a contradiction. If you find yourself in such a situation, check
207 your premises.'
208 I suggest, dear Lunatic, that you do so.

262 :   Darbon, those of us normal Backwater users understand. It is not a loss of
263   face to go to the Parrot for this. Prowess, physical, doesn't matter to
264   most of us. It can all be forgotten in a few days. For one, I wish it was

268    A consultant got a desparate call from a large company which develops dog 
269 food. "Help. Our dogs are getting fat." he is told. It turns out they run a 
270 large kennel with automatic feeding stations run by a Vax and the Vax was 
271 regularly crashing for reasons DEC couldn't figure out.
272    Sure enough, he showed up the first time just in the middle of a crash.
273 Pandemonium reigned as technicians ran around trying to reboot the system and 
274 the dogs were going wild because whenever the system crashed, all the food 
275 servers dumped the food.
276    Since they had had a PDP-11 recently with no problems, and they upgraded 
277 the power to handle the Vax, he started looking around at the power system. 
278 Sure enough, the cable went through one smart dog's cage. It had a broken 
279 sheath, so some simple Pavlovian conditioning had taught this dog that 
280 whenever he relieved himself on that one spot, he was fed.

322 
323      A man in a light brown trench coat slowly opened the wooden door to
324 the darkened room.  Artificial light spilled in from the corridor behind
325 him forming a sharp silhouette about his figure.  He was tall, six feet
326 four maybe.  His coat collar was upturned and the fedora was at a downtilt
327 which hid his face in shadows.  He stood immobile, waiting expectantly with
328 right sleeve ending in a large pocket on the outside of the coat.
329      The camera could see all this despite the dimness of the unlighted
330 room.  A small man sat before a 6-inch screen and focused the camera on the
331 silhouette.  He could not tell that the vague form was wearing a light
332 brown trench coat or even that the fedora was dark brown; nor did he care. 
333 He only knew that this was his enemy.  This was the one man who the small
334 man wished forever absent.  This dark vague form was evil.  Slowly he
335 followed the right sleeve down the side of the screen until he noticed a
336 slight bulge in the pocket where it ended.  A weapon undoubtedly, only the
337 variety left him wondering.  It may have been a pistol, explosive or some
338 other new gadget.  It did not matter though.  Nothing would save his enemy
339 now.
340      The small bald man deliberately looked away from the screen as he
341 ushed the glowing red button on the console in which the screen was inset.
342  All the vague form's expertise could not save him from the blinding flash
343 and thunderous sound that ensued and he was incinerated.  The roar of the
344 explosion reached the small man's ears and he chuckled.
345      "It doesn't matter now, does it?" he spat.  The figure had disappeared
346 from the small screen and was replaced with minute dancing white and black
347 images accompanied by the pleasing sound of static.

407     The ocean tossed and rolled violently, mother nature's fury venting itself
408 at the bulk of mankind.  With nothing to watch the awesome display, a typhoon
409 had whipped itself up in the pacific.  Not ANY typhoon, this one evidenced
410 ite
411 itself only five minutes before it raged.  From within the typhoon, the 
412 swirling vortex of mist spun energies of vast and unchained proportions.  Then,
413 the typhoon exploded in a displat of force and energy.  From deep within the
414 planet, the sleeping god neptune rolled over...
415  
416      Struggling for atmosphere, klyr paddled as best he could, the ocean a 
417 vast empty tomb.  Clawing at the surface to stay afloat, klyrpondered how he 
418 arrived.  There was a hole in space, pulling him in, and then he was here.  It
419 does not matter, though.  14 hours later, the first intra-dimensional traveler
420 was not even floating...

504 |:0.445 after launch, a plume of black smoke burst from the side of the     |
505 | right-hand booster and was visible for about 12 seconds before            |
506 | disappearing. It was near a joint sealed by a pair of rubber O-rings      |
507 | intended to prevent hot gases from escaping from between two segments of
508 | the booster.                                                              |
509 |:58 seconds, smoke appeared on the side of the right-hand booster near a   |
510 | strut that attached it to the external liquid fuel tank.                  |
511 |:59.249 seconds, an intense plume of flame appeared in this area, and the  
512 | chamber pressure in the booster rocket started to fall. Because of the    |
513 | pressure difference, the left-hand booster had more power and began       |
514 | tugging the shuttle slightly off course.                                  |
515 |:62.484 seconds, the shuttle's computers tried to compensate for the       |
516 | difference by moving the right wing flap. Mizell said the flap was moved  |
517 | so abruptly that it created a "spike" in radio data, indicating that the  |
518 | flame must have broken through the right-hand booster in explosive fashion|
519 |:63.924 seconds and at 65.524 seconds, the computers directed first the    |
520 | right-hand main engine nozzle and then the left-hand main engine nozzle to|
521 | swivel to try to compensate for the off-course motion. Mizell said this   |
522 | subjected Challenger to an up-and-down motion "like a porpoise moving     |
523 | through water."                                                           |
524 |:66.174 seconds, bright spots and then a large glow appeared on the side   |
525 | of the right-hand booster.                                                |
526 |:67.684 seconds, pressure dropped in the oxygen tank that fed the system   |
527 | of small jet thrusters that steer the shuttle, indicating that one or more|
528 | of the jets were firing to try to keep Challenger on course.              |
529 |:From 72.01 and 72.281 seconds, Challenger was rocked severely when the    |
530 | two boosters began working against each other. One tried to move left and |
531 | the other right and then suddenly, one pitched slightly up and the other  |
532 | down and the spacecraft moved sideways. Mizell said the crew probably felt|
533 | this but had no time to report it.                                        |
534 |:73.175 seconds, a puzzling cloud, perhaps from the liquid hydrogen fuel   |
535 | tank, appeared alongside the external tank.                               |
536 |:73.201 seconds, fire flashed between the shuttle and the external tank.   |
537 |:73.226 seconds, the external tank exploded near the forward attachment    |
538 | strut.                                                                    |

615 Who is to say that they were not up there just to get glory and publicity?  Granted, they were
616 people and did not deserve to die, but we must remember that people are not always what they seem
617 to us after they are gone. Was the hipe too much? Who's fault was it?
618 Many more will die. They knew the risks.  It was never a game, it was never 'safe' and it
619 never will be.  The technological threshhold has been crossed. Whenever we butt up against this
