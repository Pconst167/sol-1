69     He stopped with the wet sting of moisture laden branches against his
70 face.  Recent scratches sent host lines of pain along his bare arms.
71 Heaving a deep breath, he smelled the dank wet mould of the forest floor.
72   How far had he run?  The music of the distant pipes no longer sent
73 rivers of fire racing through his veins; no longer sang their insistent 
74 call in his ears; no longer forced his tired muscles to race to their
75 call.  He shook his head, and forced himself back to a somewhat puzzled
76 view of reality.
77   Why had he let it grip him?  Why leave the warmth and comfort of the
78 inn for some half-remembered dream that he had long ago abandoned?
79   Thank the gods (even the White Christ) that the piping had been only
80 Coel Baeg, the lesser music.  And, thank the gods, the piper was silent
81 now.  
82   He turned, lost in the moon-shot mists, all senses alive, questing. 
83 Could he hear -- faintly -- the soft hum of conversation?  The ripple
84 of a quiet stream?  The rustle of moist leaves disturbed by a soft step?
85 His nostrils twitched, hoping to smell a faint trace of the inn's 
86 smoky fire.

89 Whisper-   Dost thou remember the seller of books whose premises we used 
90 while exploring Agnath? I will send a scroll to him to hold until thou 
91 callest for it. Just tell him that thou art "Prospero's apprentice".
92 This scroll will tell how we may communicate in secret on these systems.

97      He never considered calling for help.  There was none.  He was just 
98 as certain that he was the only human within hundreds of miles as he
99 was that the old croc was watching him from those all too human eyes.
100 Octapus eyes.
101      His concentration at its fullest, he began to pull himself out
102 of the mire of wet earth, still feeling with his mind the weight of
103 the dragon as it crushed the bushes beneath it, feeling the stress on the
104 branches, the grass.  The dragon was waiting now, only yards away under
105 the bushes to the left.  It would require only one burst of those
106 massive muscles to cross those feet in an instant.  Marcus could
107 feel himself start to give off the scent of fear that would be the
108 final trigger to the landragon's frenzy.  They both stood completely
109 motionless, the dragon waiting for the perfect moment to strike,
110 the boy expanding his consciousness out further than he had ever
111 dared before, risking his life that he would not extend it too far,
112 unable to break the concentration quickly enough when the moment came.
113      Marc felt the change in the earth, the fury of the dragon's
114 bloodlust peak and barely managed to spring aside as the croc's
115 jaws closed around the earth where he had been.  In the instant it took
116 for the dragon to regain its balance, he had slipped the noose around the
117 landragon's legs and was off at a dead run.  He ran laughing with the
118 pure joy of winning.  He'd done it! After two days of hide-and-seek
119 with the monster of the world, he'd outdone it.  The crudely
120 wovenrope would not hold long, but by then his trail would be too
121 confused for a very hungry dragon to bother with.

145 Backwater is great. What other place could I take my 
146 personality apart and see responses to its pieces. Artaeus is 
147 my professional side, Grand Dragon Master my imaginative side, 
148 and LeRoy McKane my...uh, well, my...beats me what that's all 
149 about.
150 
151 Though I couldn't resist making Natasha mentally ill, in the 
152 future Aretaeus and the Grand Dragon Master won't cross paths. 
153 They will remain separate entities, Reality & Fantasy.
154 
155 Everything I said as Aretaeus is, to the best of my knowledge, 
156 true. I am using the character to develop material for future 
157 public speaking and radio broadcasts. 
158 
159 This board is helping me clarify my thinking, sharpen my 
160 writing, and test out my ideas. I appreciate your help in 
161 sharpening the tools of my trade. Thanks.
162 
163 Aretaeus (30-90 A.D.) was a Roman who first proposed that 
164 mental disorders were exaggerations of normal behavior. His 
165 insights into how abnormal behavior breaks into symptom 
166 patterns set the stage for modern diagnosis. Such as it is.

191      I'll keep my eyes open for Natasha and try to prevent anything 
192 untoward from happening to her.  I'll also alert Serena and instruct her
193 not to harm Natasha if she shows up.  Don't worry about Petrov---Serena
194 carrys her Beretta 92S 9mm for light work.  She can handle KGB drag queens
195 before breakfast with out breaking into a sweat.  She's still in a bad
196 mood since Pedro went to donkey heaven and would like to work out her
197 aggressions somewhere.

237 
238 "Nuts To You" is no joke. It is a real production. If you (or

257  
258   The merryment of the tavern failed to conquer his contemplative mood....
259 his hands around his ale, his head stooped in thought ......what
260 what was it ..............
261     His personal affairs had been settled in a short few phases of the moon.
262 The inhabitants of this fair harbour village were helpful and kind....but
263 in a distant protective fashion. He had gauged this reaction to be one of 
264 unfamiliarity as opposed to mistrust. Musing to himself he thought one could 
265 live here decades and never really be accepted..
266    Yet thinking over the recent months perhaps this guarded assistance the 
267 locals tacitly expressed spoke of another facet of the community that he had
268 until recently been unaware...........
269    It was that indefinable feeling....a tingle at the back of the mind ....
270 not unlike an itch for want of a place to scratch....long ago he had termed it
271     " The Ambigious Itch" it was his minds way of confirming that all was not
272 what it seemed.
273    This land he thought was as unknown as the sea had been in his youth.
274 And it was in this geographical pursuit that the "Itch" was most apparent....
275 Perhaps it was the inconsistency of the people that precipitated the feeling....
276 They knew the comming & going of all ships crew & cargo and recounted vast
277 histories of the town and coastline yet when questioned about what lay towards 
278 the mountains the answers grew vague and unsure and the topic quickly changed.
279 Or perhaps it was that he had been unable to locate the wizened man
280 he had spoken to his first night on land, the only one to recount anything of
281 value .........................
282   Regardless of the condition the arrangements had been made. His rucksack 
283 packed ,his room overlooking the port had been paid for several months in 
284 advance.  The only personal effect lacking was a walking stick which he had 
285 planned on finding tomorrow on the rivers wash as he began his quest upstream.
286   ..................Leaving change on the bar he thanked the barkeep and left
287   Returning to his room he found a note forced under his door. Opening the
288 parchment a coin fell to the floor. He retriived the fallen object. And on 
289 examination an odd geometric pattern was apparent.......he would clean it later
290  Written on the parchment in a strange runic scribe was
291         Be thy careful sailor
292         Choose thy course well
293         For the price of failure
294         Only doon will tell
295  
296   Dumbstruck the itch became a rash
297  
298 >>----------------------------------------------------------Brendan-----------<<
299 Gary:  To your question...I honestly am trying to disentangle your moods or
300  several sides or credibility.  Doesn't spending reform aid GOOD uses?
301 Leonard:  Omigawd, now they've brought out your loony side, too.  I once 
302  thought you were clone-proof.

310      Blustery voices--crush of people--strangers dark and seething--
311 nattering young--she had fled from the source, but the Inn's rush
312 and clatter haunted her:  the story of triumph-claimed by a boy Marcus
313 grieved her; the rapidly-changing faces and overly-loud voice of one
314 newcomer unnerved her, especially the shift of expressions when he spoke
315 of this ailment called 'schizophrenia'...
Ah, but more disturbing was
316 hearing the beauty and power of poetic description woven with skill
317 into the tales related by firelight, yet those eyes...their eyes gazed
318 vacantly, as if the listeners who drew close in admiration existed not.
319      
Stirred with appreciation, she had plucked up courage to approach
320 once, hoping to speak with one of these poets, and with a curtsy, strove
321 to offer a greeting.  But his melodic voice droned on, his eyes fixed
322 unwaveringly on some point in the fourth dimension...bewilderment and
323 chagrin caused her to retreat, slipping quickly towards the back of
324 the Inn to sort out this puzzlement.  
Her eyes sought the place where
325 Pam was wont to linger--but such was the throng, only a rare glimpse
326 was she rewarded with.  Deborah had called her name from the hearth,
327 playfully teasing about a game of chess, eyes uncomprehending...
328      
So she had fled, seeking the summer peace she had once discovered
329 in a seaside hamlet where the townfolk ask no questions and kept to
330 themselves...there, in the darkness she wanders by the lapping waters,
331 cloaked in soft brown and shielding a guttering lantern from the mischief
332 of the wind, seeking in vain for the phosphorescent wakes of fish once
333 seen from these very docks, the magic, dancing trails of light...
Peace
334 had begun to steal over her, a relaxed, drowsy feeling, as she listened
335 to the chortle of the waters against the timbers--but an unexpected
336 groan and scrape shattered it!  Quickly she knelt and extinguished
337 the flame, turning wary eyes toward the sound.  On an adjacent dock,
338 a grizzled figure was silouetted (she wondered why his bright lantern,
339 placed beside him, had not revealed him before) with attention clearly
340 focused upon his leg.  His face was scrunched into lines of pain, and
341 she made an involuntary gesture towards him, an inarticulate attempt
342 to aid him in compassion...and felt a curious sense of kinship with
343 him, just as if she knew the gnarled old fellow...

345 ***************************************************************
346 Dave:
347 
348 I've been thinking about what you said and decided to drop
349 Aretaeus and use my real name. Everything I wrote as Aretaeus 
350 was true. Most of it was based on my experiences within the 
351 mental health system in Oregon. The rest on what I've read.
352 
353 I use imagination as a tool to excape the stress of a 
354 profession that involves so much human misery and tragedy. 
355 LeRoy, Natasha, and Big Bill are characters as you might find 
356 in an adventure comic strip. The Grand Dragon Master has a 
357 longer history, and is more complicated, but is also designed 
358 to help me relax and have fun.
359 
360 Originally I didn't intend to reveal that Aretaeus and the 
361 Grand Dragon Master came from the same source. Since Aretaeus 
362 is as real as the Grand Dragon Master is fanciful I didn't 
363 want the two to get confused. I had a lapse of judgement and 
364 allowed the two to become linked. I wish I hadn't...but it's 
365 too late now.
366 
367 "Nuts To You" probably sounds far fetched but it is real. If 
368 you're curious about it send me a S.A.S.E. and I'll send you 
369 some material on it. You might find it interesting.

378 Terrible news. Natasha's body washed to shore near Izmir. She 
379 was bludgeoned to death with the stick shift from a brown and 
380 white four door fifty-seven Chevy Sedan. What happened and why?

382                        Big Bill
383 
384 :************************************************************:
385 Dave:What do you mean, -looney?  I wasn't kidding. The Dali Lama has been 
386 living in Switzerland & France, since the mid 50s. 
387 To whomever:A Berretta is a pistol. I am told by informed sources that it is 
388 QUITE good. A Uzi is a submachinegun. While it is fairly easy to conceal, it 
389 is NOT the kind of thing you can stick in your purse or pocket!
390 To the Ninja:Beware, oh foolish one. He who boasts is revealing weakness.
391 Strive to follow Bushido (as well as one of your kind can...). Remember, only 
392 he who accepts his own death will act correctly.
393 __________________________________Leonard_____________________________________
394 He ran his eyes over the new staff checking for flaws in the wood. Finding
395 none, he began to layout the intricate knotwork design he would carve into it.
396 Suddenly he paused in his work........
397 Not sure of what had drawn his attention to it, he looked toward the old
398 staff where it leaned in the corner. It was still quite serviceable, albeit a 
399 tad bit worn here and there. He had decided to make a new one just to keep in 
400 practice. And if he was working on something "useful" like a new staff, his
401 master wouldn't be looking for chores to "keep him out of trouble".
402 Deciding that there was SOMETHING about it that needed checking into, he set 
403 aside the new staff and went to the corner. Well, the old rowan staff didn't
404 appear any different, he still couldn't shake the feeling that something
405 strange. Sighing, he decided that he might as well use the oversight to settle
406 his mind about the matter. Sitting back, he closed his eyes and let his mind
407 drift....
408 After a while he opened his eyes, went to the cupboard and took a bag. He
409 reached into the bag and removed several stones. He looked at them thought for
410 awhile. Finally, he replaced them in the bag and replaced it in on it's shelf.
411 He gathered up the staff and clasped his cloak about his throat and left.
412 Later, he stood on a bridge over a stream. Holding the staff above the stream
413 he chanted:
414 By the force of your desire you have called
415 You have been heard,
416 
417 May the rowan preserve you from darkness,
418 may the iron with which it is bound be your strength,
419 And may the skill of it's carving be your guide....
420 
421 At the final word he dropped the staff into the water, watchin as it floated 
422 around the rocks on its way downstream. He hoped that the one whose need he 
423 had felt would be served well by it.
424 ......................................the apprentice..........................
425      His world was one of simple joys.  The Garden held out all the food
426 and protection he needed.  The rains washed the accumulated grime from
427 his naked body, the sun in the slightly pastel sky kept him tanned and
428 healthy.  And most of all, there was quiet; the quiet of no other
429 creature's thoughts other than his own, the quiet of no other human soul.
430 It sometimes bothered him, however, that of all the animals and plants
431 in the Garden, the dragon was the only one he couldn't hear coming.   It 
432 was if its mind were so different that it was outside his range.  But
433 he didn't bother with that long.  Today he was going to the beach.
434      Running again, for Marck liked running best of all, he thundered
435 through the tight brush, eyes darting everywhere.  Seemingly
436 oblivious to the path he traveled, his feet still never missed a step
437 or landed in some small burrow.  His awareness of his surroundings and
438 his empathy with them showed him where to plant his feet without 
439 unnecessary bother.  His growing empathy with the area in which he lived,
440 however, was still no match for his physical senses.  He still had to
441 rely on his normal senses if he were to remain fed and alive.
442      As he topped the rise before the broad stretch of ocean sand, he 
443 spotted the speeder on the beach.  Instinctively he hid himself in
444 the bushes nearest at hand, hiding himself so well that even a dragon 
445 couldn't have found him.  He knew he had to hide.  One of the few
446 memories he had of his earlier life was of a small room and a man
447 bending over him.
448    "If any strangers come, hide until you are sure you are alone.
449 Hide for your life until I come to get you!"

452 Aretaeus:
453 
454 I agree with your pleas for humanity in general, but it seems you
455 have fallen into the same trap as so many who blindly decry our
456 civilization:  You fail to offer an alternative.  Given  ALL of
457 the problems we face as a conglomerate of hundreds of millions
458 of individuals, can you offer a better solution to this problem?
459 Granted a problem exists, but calling our attention to it, while
460 it right to do so, is ineffectual without providing an alternative.
461 I don't have any idea what to  do with the mentally ill, so I entrust
462 (however misguidedly) the solutions to  the problems wherein I have
463 no expertise to those who do.  That is the crux of why so many of us
464 seem to do nothing.  Simply, we do not know what to do.

483 shame on my enemies. The sting of my blade is felt by those who oppose me.
484 The laying down of my life is felt by my comrads.

522 AS I LOOK SEARCHINGLY OUT THROUGH THE CROWD, I SPY THE
523 STRANGER WHO ARRIVED BUT A SHORT TIME AGO. TARN I BELEIVE 
524 HE SAID HIS NAME WAS. HE WAS STILL AT THE TABLE HIS HEAD IN
525 HIS ARMS APARENTLY FAST ASLEEP. NO ONE BOTHERED HIM FOR IT WAS
526 OBVIOUS FROM THE NUMEROUS EMPTY GLASSES UPON THE TABLE THAT HE
527 WAS TRYING TO FORGET A VERY UNPLEASENT PAST. I HAD CONTINUED TO
528 SERVE HIM THRU THE PAST NIGHT, FOR HIS COINAGE WAS GOOD, AND WHO 
529 AM I TO TELL ANOTHER HOW TO LIVE HIS LIFE. I LEFT HIM ALONE SAVE 
530 FOR DELIVERING HIS DRINKS WHICH HE PAID FROM A PILE OF COINS ON
531 HIS TABLE. EXCEPT FOR AN OCCASIONAL ANGRY SHOUT HE WAS A MOST 
532 RESPECTABLE AND QUIET PATRON. BUT, NOW I MUST BE OFF TO ATTEND MY 
533 CHORES AND BE TO BED, SO I INSTRUCT MY EMPLOYEES TO WATCH OVER THE
534 INN AND ASK PAM TO CLEAN THE FEW TABLES THAT REMAIN, AND I AM OFF.

538      I STAND IN THE COLD AND THE FOG OUTSIDE THE INN THAT HAS BECOME ONE OF
539 MY FAVORITE RESTING PLACES, AND THE DAMP CHILLS MY BODY AS MY THOUGHTS BE-
540 NUMB MY SPIRIT.  IT IS 3:00 IN THE MORNING, MOST OF THE PATRONS HAVE CEASED
541 THEIR CLAMOR IN FAVOR OF SLEEP, BUT I FIND THAT I AM RESTLESS DISCONSOLATE.
542 I HAVE HEARD IT SAID THAT 3:00 AM IS THE MIDNIGHT OF THE SOUL, AND MANY TIMES
543 I HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS TRUE.  THE LOSS OF ONE SO CLOSE THROUGH MY OWN SEEM-
544 ING INABILITY TO EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS, TO SAY WHAT NEEDED TO BE SAID AT THE
545 TIME, ONCE AGAIN STIRS IN ME THE REALIZATION THAT I MUST SPEAK MORE OFTEN
546 FROM MY HEART AND LESS FREQUENTLY FROM MY MIND.
547 
548      THE INN HAS BEEN CROWDED OF LATE, AND IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO FIND
549 MY WAY THROUGH THE DOOR, BUT THE CRUSH IS WELCOME TO ME.  I CAN STILL FIND
550 ENTRANCE DURING THE LATER HOURS, AND WHAT HAS BEEN LEFT BY OTHERS IS A PLEA-
551 SANT THING TO SEE.  BUT AT TIMES I MISS SOME OF MY FORMER COMPATRIOTS, AND I
552 WONDER WHAT MIGHT HAVE BECOME OF THEM.  HROTHGAR OF THE MIGHTY TOWERS OF
553 HEREOT, ANON, CYM, AND DOM WHO HAS BEEN MISSING FOR MANY MONTHS WERE ALL
554 DEAR TO ME.  AND AARON HAS BEEN AWAY, BUSY WORKING ON A UNICOM DEVICE AND IS
555 UNAVAILABLE TO US.  I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WILL RETURN SOON.
556 
557      THE CHILL IS DEEP WITHIN ME NOW, SO I MUST DEPART FOR HOME.  THE EVIL
558 THEURGY OF PAST EVENTS IS A POWERFUL TALISMAN WORKING AGAINST ME, BUT I KNOW
559 I HAVE THE POWERFUL AMULETS OF MY OWN WILL AND DETERMINATION THAT WILL GIVE
560 ME PEACE EVENTUALLY, SO I WILL ENDURE.

566 PAM: I AM QUITE STRUCK AND MOVED BY YOUR WORDS, FOR THE WORDS
567 FROM YOUR HEART ECHO THOSE THAT ONCE CAME FROM MY OWN. THERE
568 IS FAR TOO MUCH PAIN IN THIS WORLD, SO WHY DO WE BRING YET
569 EVEN MORE ON OURSELVES? PERHAPS WE FEAR THE RISK OF EVEN
570 GREATER PAIN AND THUS STAY CLOSELY ENCASED IN OUR OWN LITTLE
571 SHELL OF EMOTIONS NOT ALLOWING IT TO BE SHARED BY ANY OTHER FOR
572 FEAR THAT THEY WILL BREAK IT. AT 7:00AM IT IS FAR TOO EARLY TO
573 BE THINKING OF SUCH THINGS, FOR THE MIND IS STILL FOGGY FROM
574 THE COLD NIGHTS ENFOLDING ARMS.

588      UPON RETURN TO THE INN I FIND THAT, ONCE AGAIN, THIS TABLE HAS BEEN
589 ABANDONED AND LEFT TO ME TO CLEAN.  THE MAN WHO WAS AT THE NEARBY TABLE HAS
590 LEFT, LEAVING MANY TANKARDS TO SHOW HIS PRESENCE, AND THE AIR LEFT BEHIND IN
591 HIS ABSENCE IS FILLED WITH A SORROW THAT IS FAMILIAR TO ME IN ITS SENSATION.
592 A SENSE OF LOSS, OR PERHAPS ONE OF DESERTION, CAUSES HIM TO INDULGE IN A
593 REVERIE THAT MAY NOT BE PRODUCTIVE OR IN HIS OWN BEST INTERESTS.  BUT IT IS
594 NOT FOR ME TO DESIDE WHETHER IT IS IN HIS BENEFIT, FOR I TOO HAVE TRAVELED
595 THAT ROAD.  I WILL MERELY CLEAN HIS PLACE, AND HOPE THAT WHEN HE RETURNS HE
596 WILL FIND HIMSELF IN A HAPPIER MOOD.
597 
598      I HAVE SEEN OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF MY FRIEND OF THE DRAGONS, BUT NOW I
599 BELIEVE SHE HAS AGAIN LEFT THE INN.  I HOPE THAT THE LOOSE TALK OF HUNTING
600 HAS NOT CAUSED HER OFFENSE, OR GIVEN HER PAUSE TO THINK THAT SHE IS NOT WEL-
601 COME.  SHE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT ALL HUNTERS SPEAK OF ADVENTURES THAT HAVE
602 HAPPENED ONLY IN THEIR IMAGINATIONS, AND EXAGGGERATE SO TO APPEAR GREATER IN
603 THE EYES OF THEIR FELLOWS, OR EVEN TO STOKE THE WANING FIRES OF THEIR OWN
604 EGOS.  IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT, WHILE EVEN DRAGONS ARE NOT
605 ABOVE PETTY EVIL AND JEALOUSY IN THEIR DAILY LIVES, THEY ONLY THREATEN DEATH
606 AND DESTRUCTION IN THE MINDS OF HUMANS, RATHER THAN IN REALITY.  THOUGH
607 THEY MAY NOT BE ABOVE AN EXTREMELY SUBTLE HUMOR THAT FEW ARE CAPABLE OF
608 SEEING.
609 
610      CLEAN THE TABLE, CLEAN THE TABLE!!  I WILL, SIRRAH, IF ONLY I HAVE THE
611 CREATIVITY TO DO SO.  I DID ATTEMPT TO VISIT YOUR OWN LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT,
612 DJJ, BUT I FOUND THE DOOR CLOSED AND LOCKED AS IT HAS OFTEN BEEN IN THE PAST
613 FEW WEEKS.  I HOPE THAT THE DISASTER THAT BEFELL YOU WILL SOON BE RESOLVED,
614 AND THAT YOUR DOORS WILL AGAIN BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.  PERHAPS HE NEEDS A
615 GOOD BARMAID TO CLEAN UP AFTER HIM?  BUT THEN, I AM HAPPY IN MY PLACE, AND
616 I WOULD HESITATE TO EVER LEAVE THE STERN BUT GRACEFUL EMPLOY OF OUR CISTOP.
617 
618      I WOULD THANK YOU FOR YOUR GOOD WORDS, FRIEND MIKEY.  THERE ARE TIMES
619 WHEN THE HEART IS HEAVY AND FULL OF DOUBT, AND IT IS AT THESE TIMES THAT WE
620 MOST NEED THE REASSURANCE OF THOSE FRIENDS.  I HOPE THAT YOUR MISADVENTURE
621 CAME TO A PROPER CONCLUSION.  I WOULD SAY A HAPPY CONCLUSION, BUT SOMETIMES
622 THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE.
623 
624      ONCE AGAIN, THE INN IS EMPTY OF PATRONS, AND THE TABLES AND BAR ARE
625 CLEANED AND STRAIGHTENED, THE CHAIRS UPTURNED AND ON THE TABLES, AND THE
626 LAMPS AND CANDLES EXTINGUISHED.  THOSE WHO WILL STAY THE NIGHT HAVE RETIRED
627 TO THEIR ROOMS, AND I MUST RETURN HOME.  AH, I LONG FOR THE WARM SPRING.
