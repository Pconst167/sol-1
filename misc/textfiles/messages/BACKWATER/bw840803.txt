41 1.  Avoid alliteration. Always.
42 2.  Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.
43 3.  Avoid cliches like the plague.  (They're old hat).
44 4.  Employ the vernacular.
45 5.  Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.
46 6.  Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.
47 7.  It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.
48 8.  Contractions aren't necessary.
49 9.  Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.
50 10. One should never generalize.
51 11. Eliminate quotations.  As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "I hate quotations.
52         Tell me what you know."
53 12. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.
54 13. Don't be redundant; don't use more words than necessary; it's highly superfluous.
55 14. Be more or less specific.
56 15. Understatement is always best.
57 16. One-word sentences?  Eliminate.
58 17. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.
59 18. The passive voice is to be avoided.
60 19. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.
61 20. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.
62 21. Who needs retorical questions?
63 22. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.

68 Rocky and I pretended to be setting up a large conference, but
69 dropped hints to the Plaza personnel that we were looking for
70 the NET.  A tall grave Frenchman ushered us into the security
71 office looking irritated by our inquiries.  We made perfunctory
72 conversation and turned to leave.  Something was odd.  The 
73 room was moving downward.  When we were more than five stories
74 down, the Frenchman rose and smiled graciously.
75   "We've been expecting you Ms. Minsky.  Welcome to NET Head-
76 quarters.  The French accent had been replaced by a slight
77 Scottish one.  "i am Ian MacHinery. And you must be Rocky."
78 Rocky glared suspiciously.  "I understand you need to contact
79 your brother, Mohammed Wassir.  We can help you in this." An
80 attractive Middle-Eastern woman appeared and spoke to Rocky
81 in a strange tongue.  His face brightened and he followed her
82 out the door.  Ian turned to me.
83   "You wish to help us.  Good. We know how you detest McKane
84 Industries.  We also know that the box of weapons intercepted
85 by Rocky contains a weapon that is of both strategic and sci-
86 entific interest to us.  It was developed by a clever free-
87 lance agent called Sundowner.  It will greatly enhance our 
88 forces.  The key to McKane stock holding that Rocky holds is
89 worthless.  Honored Matri stole the contents of that cabinet
90 long ago and is using them as a lure for former double-agent
91 petrov.  He will do anything to possess her and the stocks,
92 for this will strip the McKane empire of assets rendering the
93 merger with Wassir meaningless.  We are hoping for a battle
94 between Wassir and Petrov as this will weaken them both. We
95 will use Rocky to get information from Wassir. He is being
96 given a disguise that is wired to recieve conversations."  Ian
97 paused.  His eyes glowed as he contemplated the bugging gadget-
98 ry.  He looked absorbed and content for several minutes, then
99 looked at me, startled. "ah. Yes. Minsky. You will use your
100 knowledge of McKanes spiritual swindles to aid two NET op-
101 on their way to Oregon. (Don't be fooled by their appearance.
102 They're really quite competent.)"
103   Rocky returned in a dashing Indiana Jones get-up.  He whis-
104 pered to me, "We should don't trust him, Gaudy.  He is talking
105 funny."
106 "He's Scotch, Rocky," I explained.
107 "Ah,"he beamed, "you are the people who make the tape."
108 "Tacky, tacky, tacky, murmured Ian.

158    The tired figure stooped over the scattered collection of circuit boards
159 straightened and pressed a hand to his back.  That was the last IC (74S175)
160 to replace.  Now to power up the bare machine.  Success!  One by one, checking
161 the additional boards -- more repairs -- finally, a complete system.

163     The piper entered the familiar room and looked about.  He listened for a
164 while to the innkeeper's tale of transportation woes, nodding philisophically
165 as the patrons chimed in.  It was always thus -- can you imagine the problems
166 you would have with horses?  The miserable beasts are of VERY precarious 
167 health at the best of times, and the best of times never occur when you have
168 somewheree to go or someone to see.  At least with an automobile you can 
169 replace damaged parts .. but then, autos don't have little cars to replace
170 themselves either.  Musing, the piper accepted a glass of the innkeeper's
171 fine ale and headed for a seat in the corner.

173 MiG -- thanks for the offer.  I made it back this time, but will keep an eye

192 of cheating.  I'm uncertain of how to respond.  I wasn't aware that this
193 charade had any rules.  But if it does, I would appreciate you elucidating
194 those that I have violated.
195      NET 06 sent Wassir a message about this thing degenerating into 
196 name-calling.  I figured it was an honest mistake on both our parts
197 and apologized.  Now I am personally attacked and honestly, I feel
198 outraged.  If you want to attack Wassir, have at it.  That's what he's
199 there for.  I enjoy the challenge.  But if you're going to unlease an
200 unprovoked attack against me personally, perhaps I should retire from the
201 fray.  I'm usually not thin-skinned, but your accusations are scurilous.

206 Michael: Don't get too ruffled. As near as I can see, the problem
207 here is that your side very much wants a merger of Mckane Ind. , and
208 the other side doesn't. Both sides appaer to be very stuborn on this
209 issue, and I doubt that the story line will get anyfurther until that
210 issue is settled. When you run out of aumunition, it always degrads
211 into name calling (what else have you got to fight with?). However,
212 I do agree that continued agression after an appology was put forth
213 is definatly unnice. They should have gracfully accepted, and
214 considered possibly appologizing in return, and then try to determine 
215 what could be done to correct the situation.

279 TO: Olsen & Bigham
280 SUBJ: Apology
281 I knew when I said that that I shouldn't.  It sounded childish
282 and petulent.  Unfortunately, I was pissed by the direction the
283 story was going (and not going) and the reasons this was happening.
284 I hereby apologize to both Mr. Olsen and Mr. Bigham for dragging your
285 selves into the mess, instead of leaving it on the personna level.
286 Preliminary explanation: It appears to me that the styles of the people
287 on the NET side are almost incompatible with those on the McKane/W.M. side.
288 After leaving a laboriously written entry carefully tying all details
289 together, it is frustrating to log on and find that in a 5 line
290 bulletin, everything is either ignored or casually destroyed.  While I admit
291 that this is the way the story goes, it is the feeling I get while reading
292 that bothers me.  The merger between McKane Industries and Mohammed's
293 company is "the straw that broke the camel's back" for me.  If it had
294 gone only half as far as it did, it would have been fine.  Unfortunately, it
295 kept escalating by more and more unreasonable means.  Each side states that
296 it has been solved, but then the other side does some increasingly
297 improbable manipulation to `one-up'.  While the personnas are the ostensible
298 causes, the people behind the characters are obviously the true culprits -
299 that is why I finally attacked you personally.  Lest I appear too rational
300 in this message, I will now point out that I feel the McKane/W.M. side of the
301 conflict is guilty of the worst offenses against logic and probability.
302 I realize that I should never have criticized you personally.  That does not
303 belong on this board. I should either have ignored you or sunk to your
304 level.  I am sorry.
305 I will now log off and review what has been said lately, and decide
306 what it is I SHOULD have said.

314 Well done, and well said. After my recent stint at IBM, where such
315 foul play as Mckane's and Wassir's are common place, it is a
316 refreshing sight to see the other side standing up for their
317 rights. Eagle Computer was staffed by a bunch of wimps. The same
318 goes for Corona. You have stated your point quite nicely. I applaud
319 you and your efforts. But...And I must state this from experience.
320 In the world of big business, or spy business, cheating is a way
321 of life. There is no way around it. You must reorganize your plans
322 to include such activities. If I can be of any help, please drom
323 me a line on the comset.

326 
327 To the spies in the audience:
328    I hope you guys aren't going to get all pissed at each other and stop
329 writting your stories. There has been a great deal of work put into the
330 story so far, and I would hate to see it go down the drain. Please try to
331 work out your differences. This latest thing with the SEC...what a mess.
332 1) Messages eminating from McKane and Wassir seem to be pointing towards
333    a merger.
334 2) AP story on possible merger confirms suspicions
335 3) UPI story on AP computer break-in nullifies ANY merger plans, by quoting
336 SEC chairman.   Followed quickly buy insulting message from Hollywood.
337 4) Accusation of using old technique, which by the way, no record can be
338    found supporting this claim, and the records are VERY complete.
339 5) Short memo completely going against what had been stated earlier in the
340    UPI article. Breaking the loose set of rules that "govern" these 
341    adventures, in as far as they completely went against previous message.
342 6) Accusations of cheating towards personnas by agent 07.
343 7) Accusations of cheating towards REAL people, also in bad taste.
344 8) Indignate reply from both parties.
345 9) Apologies from agent 02.
346 10) This message.
347 
348 Possible solution: Let Mckane & Wassir have their merger. The message about
349 the planned take-over of Fortune 500 is ludicrous though. Forget it. NET 
350 will no doubt respond to the merger. They will try to end it. Gaudy Minsky
351 and Rocky have information that can destroy the merger. The ball is in
352 the NETwork's court.
353 
354 Ignore or responde. But I hope you work things out. This is probably the best
355 adventure yet. Please don't ruin it.

359 From: Wassir
360      Okay.  Let's bury the hatchet and get on with some tom-foolery.  If you
361 don't like the direction of the plot line, then change it.  Be creative.  I
362 think that person posting the Rocky and Gaudy M. story line has the right
363 idea.  Wassir and McKane may get the merger, but it could be an empty
364 triumph.
365      If I have offended anyone, I apologize.  I know that I have treated
366 some personnas pretty shabily, I zapped Petrov the worst.  To him, I am
367 truly sorry.  My only defense is that Leroy and I created a character 
368 named Petrov about a year ago.  The concept of a hairy-legged KGB drag
369 queen was too good to pass up.  If you don't like what I'm doing with
370 your character either speak up(in a reasonable fashion) or use your 
371 imagination in extricating yourself.  Take a clue from 06, he did a great
372 job when I attacked him with an Albanian toilet plunger.
373      As for the frustration of working hard to create an entry and then
374 having someone ignore it, or blow your plans; it has happened to all of us.
375 It's frustrating, but you have other options than resorting to personal
376 attacks.  If you have a problem with the way I'm conducting myself, then
377 contact me on the Bit Bucket and we can hash things out.  If worse comes
378 to worse, I'm in the book...give me a call.

383 I think the McKane adventure has run its course and should be 
384 retired gracefully before it deterioriates any further. I 
385 suspect the spy/intrigue format has already been milked for 
386 all it's worth. It occurs to me that if we put the adventure 
387 on the shelf for a few months, coming back to it when we're 
388 fresh, that it might pick up some life. Of course, if you folks
389 have some fresh ideas to get it moving, more power to you. I 
390 wonder, though, if this bickering isn't a sign that we all need
391 a rest.                   Grand D.

405 something strange has been happening with this system. anyway-
406 L'homme: i have a visitor at my house. he is french. what does
407          "embrace-moi" mean? he said that to my brother. two 
408          times. and i have been speaking french for a couple of
409          years but i don't know what it means. neither does
410          my brother.

421 DEENA : Well, I have bee taking French at PSU for two years, and I have never
422         seen that word either. My guess are:
423         "embrasse-moi" : Kiss me. Maybe this french guy is a little weird.
424         "embrase-moi"  : Set me on fire. This French guy is really wierd!
425         Sorry I can't be more help. Anyway, I would watch this guy. And your
426         brother should too.
427 GDM   : I disagree. At the last PCS and afterwords get-together, we discussed
428         several story directions, all of which had great potential. I am
429         waiting for knock-out messages from Joshua and Petrov. Guady Minsky,
430         Ms. Matre, Rocky, Ian, myself, Petrov, Joshua, and all the NET agents
431         are fully intending to continue. Hopefully, Leroy himself and Mohammad
432         Wassir will also continue, but if that is not to be the case, we will
433         continue without you. But I and others hope you do stick it out a
434         little longer. I am sure this problem will blow over, as I suspect it
435         already has, with apologies from all concerned. Let's just get on
436         with the story, and may the side that is with honor and goodness
437         prevail (the NET of course!)
438 Ninja : You never showed up at the last meeting! Are you still planning on
439         getting in on the archive buy? With Aaron gone off the face of the
440         earth, and d refusing to make any comment or appearance what-so-ever,
441         we are down to three again. RSVP.
442 Mikey : What can I say but I am sorry. I really thought that we would have the
443         money for you. If I don't get word in the next couple days, I will
444         pay the extra $50 myself, and hopefully get paid back at some later
445         date. I feel quite badly about promising you your money after you
446         went to all the trouble to copy those disks so quickly. Like I said,
447         you will be paid before the end of this week regardless of whether I
448         hear from the others or not. I would like to point out that all NET
449         agents promptly paid their portions over 2 weeks ago. Please don't
450         give up, besides, I would like to see your corporate headquarters
451         anyway.
452 Alex & other riskers : This Saturday? Is that what MiG said. Well I guess it
453                        sounds OK to me. Remember, I at least would like to
454                        help out a little as far as the food & drink goes. What
455                        can we bring?

474    With a strange sense of passiveness I watched as the lone aircraft vomited
475 its deadly cargo.  There was the expanding mushroom cloud sweeping as a scythe
476 across the countryside, smothering a corner of humanity like a candle on the 
477 sea-shore.  The global devastation which followed!  There would be no more
478 spies, no more super industries, no more political figures or religious
479 arguments.  Somewhere in the background a song began: "We'll meet again, don't
480 know where, don't know when..."  Credits scrolled on the screen.
481    There was a voice from behind me.  "Petrov, I presume."
482 I could hear the owner of that voice seating himself.
483    "You're late," I stated coldly.  "You missed the first feature."  There was a
484 brief pause.  "You are a junior agent, of course.  Up to this point Wassir has
485 rudely avoided me -- apparently he fails to realize that I am the majority 
486 stockholder in Rent-A-Miracle.  Furthermore, I have access to information which
487 can completely destroy his meager position in McKane Industries."
488    The agent spoke.  "I am employed by McKane Industries.  If you're as
489 powerful as you claim, you would be addressing me as your own agent."
490    "My official status is on record," I replied.  "And you certainly don't
491 expect me to believe that Wassir doesn't have a private agency to deal with his
492 covert activities.  So predictable.  Even the way he presumes leadership of
493 McKane Industries without a sufficient power base.  This is how we differ.  I
494 have systematically increased the validity of my position and am about to
495 acquire documents which will thrust me to unreachable levels."
496    "Perhaps you do have some power, Petrov."  The voice had the sound of harsh
497 determination.  A knife quickly descended upon the head of the person in front
498 of him.  That was meant for me!  Styrofoam!  My dummy paid off after all.
499    Rising from behind the next seat over, facing the agent, I said, "You'll
500 never kill a person that way."  Then I shot him (a silencer on the gun, of
501 course.)  Fortunately there was no one else in the theater.  Perhaps, I thought,
502 Wassir does have at least an iota of respect for my position.  It's up to him
503 whether or not he wants to play ball with me.  I set out to meet Honored Matre.
