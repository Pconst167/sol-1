29   Master Changer, you may not have noticed, but even before the Aryan Nations were exposed, I and Man in Gray were talking
30 about nazi's in Idaho.
31   From my experience with them, they are the same sort of Anglo Christian Terrorist organization that is now finding more and
32 more acceptance in secluded American cities, both North and South of the Mason Dixon Line.

37 way to annoy users...
38   as the reports shined on the screen... one came to his attention more than any other... a report of a power failure in one
39  f many nations formed hundreds of years ago... after the demise of the Norseman and the viking ways...
40 
41   the nation was dethek and was presently a hot bed of soviet activity... aside from the usual dockings... two small nuclear
42 submarine had been docked for some two months now... unusual because the soviets were pulling all of their submarine fleet
43 into three task forces... apparently... these two ships had a very special importance...
44   no work was being done on the submarines... and there was no real damage sufficient enough to warrant it staying in port...
45 
46   one report from an agent markesson said they were doing intensive amounts of radiation work inside the submarine... leading
47  ne to beleive they incurred damage to one of their on board nuclear missiles...
48 although they were not decipghered... the simple fact that they were using their highest codes and best scrambling routines...
49 indicated something very important was transpiring in dethek...

71    "I have some bad news for you Farley. 'Fred' is missing. I think it is safe to assume our welcoming party had
72 something to do with it." 
73    Farley didn't take this well at all. He holstered Betsy, and climbed up into the truck to see the empty trailer for
74 himself. "Who could have known about this? I thought you ran a tight organization here? What have I joined, a bunch of
75 dolts who can't keep track of agents or cars?" It was obvious that Farley had become rather close to Fred, the way a man
76 becomes close to mechanical objects that nonetheless take on personalities of their own.
77    "We'll do everything we can to recover the car, Farley.", Fellows told him, trying to reassure the newest member of
78  ET. "Remember, we want to examine Fred as much as you want to drive him."
79 near a picture of a cherry fruit pie.
80    L'homme emerged from the BMW, and motioned the others over to it. "I have radioed Ian, and told him about what
81 happened here. He is getting right on the apparent leak, and will report back to us when he finds out more about it. In
82 the meantime, let us head over the old Lovejoy restaurant. We have some business to attend there. Besides, I am getting
83 a bit hungry."
84    Fellows seemed to like the idea, but Farley was a bit perplexed. "Food! Now! Is that all you can think of? What about
85 Fred? What about this truck and the hitman you so coolly dispatched? Are you just going to leave it?"
86    L'homme tried not to lose patience. Farley was new at this elevated game and all, but still..."It is you, my friend,
87 who doesn't understand. I can understand your curiosity, but when you question NET's decisions, you are going a bit
88 too..."
89    Farley cut him off. "I WASN'T questioning! I just can't understand how you can take all of this without so much as
90 blinking an eye. You just killed a man! Do you always go around leaving bodies in the street so nonchalantly?"
91    "May I remind you of your own actions. If I hadn't been in the position I was to disable our would-be assailant, I
92 have no doubt he would have wound up on the short end of a .45 caliber slug, courtesy of Eugene Farley. Am I not correct?"
93    "Well...I guess you...", Farley stammered, and he wasn't used to it. He may not have been the world's greatest
94 detective, but he always had a semblance of self-confidence. It was these blasted NET agents. They were too good. They had
95 all the right moves. They were always in control. He couldn't help feeling a bit inadequate, and hence, a bit on edge.
96    "Things will be taken care of. It is not the agent's job to go around cleaning up after himself. An agent must move
97  ast, and always be ready and willing to move on. Someone once said our organization could be compared to, believe it or
98 not, the Air Force. The Air Force employs tens of thousands of people to support only a few. The whole objective of an air
99 force base with hundreds or maybe thousands of people working there is to support a relative handful of pilots and planes.
100  hose few pilots must be the tops in everything they do. They are pampered and completely taken care of. But when they
101 are  called into action, they are on their own. The thousands can't do a thing but maybe watch, listen in, and clean up
102 afterwards. Are you beginning to get the picture Farley?"
103    Farley nodded his head, but remained silent. #So much is happening so fast. Where does it all end? Or does it end?#
104    "Into the car, gentlemen. We must be off. In ten minutes this street will look completely normal. Nothing out of the
105 ordinary happened here, right?", L'homme looked at his companions for conformation. "Right.", they replied in unison.
106    "Fellows...off to the Lovejoy. Farley, I hope you are hungry. We may be awhile there..."

151 CISTOP MIKEY: I must have 'spoken' too soon in requesting that E/O be removed.
152   It is obvious, by the looks of tilean's and L'Homme's entries that we may 
153   never be low on the twit supply. For all our safetys sake, please return E/O

157  AArrrggg!!! Twits abound everywhere!! 
158  istop; It is with a heavy heart, and exasperated fingers that I submit my tired agreement with The Guardian that
159  e return to (stammer, gasp, gag) E/O. It seems that the more twitly sections of society will never let up in their
160  uest to deface that which is beautiful. Perhaps it is jealousy that drives them, for I find it highly doubtful that
161  ne who goes through the Inn, destroying carefully chosen groups of words, brought together by brightly shining 
162  ntellects could duplicate such feats without change, at least to the attitude. I will not go so far as to threaten
163  hese individuals with what will happen to them if they do not stop, for that would make me no better than them.
164      But if I may be so bold, I would like to make a suggestion to my fellow visitors to the Inn; Though it may be
165  ifficult, I suggest that we simply ignore the twits, and see what happens. As I have 2 younger brothers, I know that 
166  his is an extremely potent tactic against children, and what are twits, if not children. I realize that it will be
167  xtremely difficult at first, to watch your words slaughtered before you, bbut think of it as a battle of the wills:
168  s against the twits, with your words against their childish attention-getting schemes.
169      With this, and wishes of luck in whatever you find yourself doing, I leave you.
170      Good luck,

173  The control O wouldn't be so bad if they knew how to turn
174 it off.  If it was used wisely an entry can be greatly enhanced
175 with the use of control O, if they knew how to turn it off.
176 For my machine, a control N places the text back to normal,
177 but I'm not sure if other computers view it in the same way.
178  For those of you out there who are using Ascii Express, just
179 keep the chat on so whenever the ^O pops up you can hit ^N and
180 take care of it.

186 I would like to know the name of the person who recently started (and stopped) a
187 local bbs by the name of Hitchhiker's.  You are wasting people's time by
188 starting a system you have no intention of finishing, or even leaving up for
189 more than a few days.  Let's hear from you:  Have you really given up, or what?
190 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
191   if the person did not tell anyone that is was a test... then i might say that it was not nice... perhaps you did waste your 
192 time... but at least one person learned something about the nature of running a system...
193   it is Difficult and also Expensive... and if it was necessary for the operator to take it off line... the so be it... it is
194 not productive to scream about... it can do nothing but hurt some people... and scare others...

201                    The tea starts weak, steeping quickly,
202                    becoming strong.
203                    Maybe I'll add some honey or some lemon,
204                    it adds a little spice.
205                    It lies in its warm cup,
206                    steaming with silent pride at
207                    no one in particular.
208                    I wonder if it lies to itself,

210                    must be more that lukewarm.

263     The scene at the hospital was reaching high levels of insanity, Tina
264 had finally finished the paperwork on Jack's admittance. Tony and Marci
265 were barking at each other over Jack's condition. Jack was quite unstable
266 and just wanted relief from his pain, the Lone Stars were wearing off and
267 he was downright uncomfortable with his dilema.
268     An operating room was now available and Jack was brought in for surgery.
269 As the orderly wheeled him down the hall, the other 3 were beside him 
270 offering support. A nurse stopped his friends at the door to the operating
271 room and Jack was taken in alone.
272 *one hour later*
273     The doctor approached Marci and informed her the surgery was a success
274 and the Gold card was needed so Jack could check out. (gleem in doc's eye).
275 Jack walked out, his arm in a sling; carrying several pain perscriptions
276 to be filled as soon as possible. A look of relief could be seen on all
277 faces. Marci's hand was shaking as she signed the Bankcard receipts, "Gee
278 this is more pain than Jack had." But she turned and saw Jack's sad face
279 " Oh babe, I'm sorry your worth it to me" taking his good arm she walked
280 him towards the door.
281    The foursome was almost to the door when an orderly with a wheelchair
282 came rushing at them at aprox warp 7. "hey you guys, hospital rules state
283 patients must be wheeled out the door." In his haste the orderly left the
284 chair with Marci and Jack had a seat. Tony grabed the handles and put Jack
285 up on two wheels and away they went. The orderly was now flirting with
286 the receptionist and did not notice that the wheelchair had not been returned.
287   Tony opened the trunk and deposited the chair inside. " You guys take 
288 Jack home, Ive got unfinished buisness here."

293 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     (you don't know me well enough yet, 'lady')
294 Miss Ryan,  In the most serious tone, I would like to say that having only seen
295   me once, I don't believe that you could really make a decision as to my 
296   character, nor I yours. If you have actually read any of the stuff I put into
297   these mighty disks of enlightenment and encouragement, you should know by now
298   that *I* would NEVER touch another persons entries.  At the time I first 
299   entered the Inn, some ####### was going about Randomly Deleting any and all 
300   subject matter. (You should know this already.) Unfortunately, the same deed
301   has been the defamation of me twice now. And both times I'VE BEEN BLAMED!
302 *****  For the record, fellas:   I'M NOT DOING IT, I NEVER HAVE, I NEVER WILL!
303   Is that clear enough, or should I draw you a picture? No, I didn't delete the
304   entry, I must have just been the unfortunate slob that had the displeasure of
305   calling after the deed had been committed.
306   You may never know how much I respect this place because like you, all my 
307   identities are known to only a few. (Ian, the list is being prepared for you.)
308   If you care to discuss this further, I'd be glad to... MANO-A-MANO. 'Nuf said.

	Rarely have I entered into the stories here, long have I stood in
347 the shadows at the edge of this reality marveling at the beauty.  But for
348 some months, a quiet voice has been missed.  Did I hear it once again, if
349 only for a moment?  The tone seemed familiar.  I hope I am correct, and if
350 I am, perhaps some warm cider may be provided by one known better than I.
351 Strangers should not take such liberties.

355   Raza moved down the beach in a hurried walk. As soon as he was around the
356 point and out of sight he broke into a run. The colorful visual symphony of
357 the tropical sunset went unappreciated by this fleeing figure. Raza's full
358 attention was focused on his overdue meeting with Dixie. How was he going to
359 explain being late?
360   Raza's sweat-soaked clothes made a squishing sound as he jumped into his
361 car and roared off toward town. Staying on the twisting, packed-dirt roads
362 took good skill and dexterity even at low speeds. Raza's haste to reach town
363 resulted in the modification of several palms. The glancing blows left a
364 trail of blue markings along the tree trunks. The one panel on the car that
365 escaped reshaping was the top of the hood. Only young, fast reflexes and
366 blind luck prevented a major crash.
367   After a quick shower and a change of clothes Raza headed for the hotel.
368 While he drove he tried desperately to think of how he was going to explain
369 all of this to Dixie. Now there was his dented car to complicate things. As
370 he drove up to the hotel he saw Dixie sitting on the patio of the `Wrecked
371 Virgin Bar', sipping a drink. When she saw Raza's car her eyes opened wide
372 in surprise. The angry speech she had been saving melted into concern.
373   "Oh Raza! Just look at your car. Are you OK?"
374   "Y-Yes I am.", Raza stammerd, "I had a little problem."
375   "I can see that, honey. You sit down here now y'hear. We'll get you a
376 drink to calm your nerves. It must have been a terrible accident. I'm so
377 glad you weren't hurt. Now where is that waiter? He is soooo slow!"
378   Raza gave lady luck a silent kiss. It looked like Dixie's assumption about
379 what happened had gotten him off the hook. He began thinking up a quick
380 story that wasn't an outright lie.
381   "Dixie, I'm sorry I'm late. I..."
382   "Don't worry your little head about it. I can see you've been through a
383 terrible experience. You have that drink and compose yourself. I'll call
384 daddy and have him send the boat back for us in a little while."
385   Dixie pulled an instrument from her purse and began pushing buttons.
386   "What in the world is that?", Raza blurted out.
387   "It's a new radio-phone. One of daddy's companies makes them. He gave me
388 one so I can call the yacht if I need anything. Be a sweetheart and go call
389 a taxi to take us down to the dock. It's much too hot to walk and your car
390 looks perfectly dangerous. I'm surprised it didn't fall apart already."

393      A forgotten television flickered in the corner.  Doctor Frankenstupe
394 stared out the window, not seeing the freshly fallen snow.  His mind was
395 troubled.
396      Sigmund walked into the room.  "Doctor, the Young and Restless is on,
397 aren't you watching?"  No response.  "Doctor... DOCTOR!"  Slowly, the Doctor
398 turned.  "What's the matter with you, today?"  Sigmund asked.
399      "The Dragon Lady is miffed at me,"  the Dr. said.  "What have I done
400 to offend her?"
401      "Just ask.  I'm sure she'll tell you."
402      "Oh no, I can't.  Her wrath is terrible, indeed.  If I really upset 
403 her, she may have a dragon sit on me."
404       "I doubt that.  Screw up your courage and speak out."
405       "But what about the dragon?"  The Doctor held his head in his hands.
406 "Wait... I know."  He hurried to a large trunk and pulled something out.
407 "My Exalted Buffalo Lodge head dress--no dragon will sit on me now."  On
408 the Doctor's head perched a fierce-looking hat with large upward curving
409 horns on each side.  "Now for a weapon."
410       "That may not be a good idea.  Remember, you're not allowed anything
411 sharp."  Sigmund said.
412       "No, no... it's for show, nothing else."  The Doctor went to the 
413 closet and returned with a pushbroom.  So clad, he stood in the middle of
414 the room, puffed out his chest, and called out with mock bravery...
415 
416      "Lady of Dragons, you have a grievance with me.  Let us speak
417       of it like adults... and please, no dragons."
418

456     tilean lifted one foot off the landing rods... the helicopter blades ripped a swath in the air... only inches of above his
457 ad... he could hear the rips...
458     tilean jogged lightly out to the isolated tower in the field... it ought to be the control tower of this field... thought
459 tilean as he jogged...
460 
461     as he neared the door... his tie flew up... a sudden gust of wind... and the door was opened... tilean was inside... tit
462 was a strange silence that replaced the gale...
463     gray skies of a northern country are always beautiful... or at least... the thoughts inspired are always gracefull...
464 
465     tilean lifted one fott in front of the other... turning slightly with each step... slowly climbing the twisting stairway..
466     finally he started rising to the height of people in the control tower... there were five people... all sitting at a long
467 control panel... six screens carried the international codes for radar flight notation...
468 
469     altitude... airline and nation of origin... all the proper data... plus a line of eight digits tilean did not understand..
470     tilean memorized eight of the eight digit codes... later reference and all that...
471     there also seemed to be fifty times the number of flights in the area there should have been... odd... the screens listed
472 one of the flights from soviet russia as being only a mile away... odd because there was not a single plane in sight... and
473 vibility was good...
474 
475     one theory seemed to make sense to tilean... the range on tis radar installation was fifty to sixty times that of a nnorml
476 installations... and judging from the nation of origin... the eight digit codes ought to lead to some sort of native military
477 designation for a particlar class of plane... this was not a civilian field...
478 
479     presently... one of the men turned round to greet tilean... he extended his hand and welcomed a mister semplers... which
480 was going to be tilean's cover name for the duration of this mission...
481     tilean shook the airline controller's hand and exchanged the normal greetings... still thinking about the eight digit code
482 for one of the soviet flights... even though it was a civilian plane... it's code was similar to one of the american planes en
483 route for a german airbase from iceland... that soviet flight was armed and probably on alert...
484 
485     tilean waited for the taxi to come and take him to his hotel... until then tilean gained some more information on the exac
486 nature of the eight digit codes... the soviet plane was carrying sensitive radar gear... as sensitive as one of their newer
487 'sayaskana' radar ships... half as accurate as anawax... but still accurate enough...
488     although it was being tailed by seven american fighters... tilean decided to gain more information on this soviet plane...
489 the distination of which was the same port city the two submarines were docked at...

509 ======================My name is David Hornbuckle and I just got a modem for christmas.
510 I am using a VIC20.
511 I would like to hear
512 from anybody about 
513 anything. I'm new at
514 
515 this modem stuff!

520 Hmm, new modems out there...
521 #$##$##$##$#
522 #Fred gone!#  I could hardly contain myself.  What had first started as a simple mission was growing infinitely more
523 complex.
524 Despite my state of mind, I forced logic into my grey matter.  #Look for clues!#, I thought.
525 I scrambled inside to see the trailer myself.  The emptiness inside it mirrored the numb feeling I got just thinking
526 about Fred's components spread out on some lab table.
527 Seeing that I could do nothing here, I followed L'homme and Fellows to a restaurant.  NET certainly had sought out
528 the better eating places in Portland as well as the 'danger points', my stomach soon told me.  Even though my face
529 plainly conveyed loss and anger, my hunger (which had grown considerably these past two days) tempered emotions long
530 enough to finish eating.
531 "So," I began, "now what?  Fred first or Gaudy and Flemming?  Or are the 'disappearances somehow related?  You both
532 know how much I miss Fred- but I, if this is a democratic situation, vote for getting Gaudy and Flemming first.  
533 They can suffer, feel pain, and die.  Fred... well, if worst comes to worst, he can be reconstructed.  I think I 
534 remember enough from his manuals."
535 Fellows finished off a delightful-looking piece of cherry pie, then spoke:  "I agree.  Ian's AI research can wait
536 'till later.  Minsky and Flemming first."
537 "I suppose that makes it unanimous," L'homme said.  "Any ideas on where to begin?"

540 To: Operative Elizabeth Ryan
541 From: John K. O'Hara, DSNAC, UNDERGROUND
542 Subject: Mark I Chipher and more
543 Miss Ryan, the problems you have experienced are due to mistyping of the
544 encipherment program.  If you would send a diskette to UNDERGROUND HQ near
545 Portland, the program will be encoded upon it.
546 The other reason for this message, Miss Ryan, is to comment on how slovenly
547 your 'secret agent' practices are.  The Guardian is not necessarily guilty
548 of deletions because his entry follows.  A good operative would have clarified
549 the situation further before acting.  If you were to display the same degree
550 of slovenliness during a 'contact', enemy agents could easily fool you into
551 thinking they were legitimate.  Your employment currently hangs precariously
552 by a thread- no results from your NET investigations, displays of faulty
553 reasoning, and your report broadcast times are off by a full fifteen
554 minutes.  I do hope for your sake that improvement is soon forthcoming.

558 "I'm ready, doc!", I called out.
559 Dr. Juzem looked up from his work across the room and smiled.  "All right, 
560 I'll be there in just a moment.  The mixture is almost ready."
561 I really hated the idea of needles piercing my skin, but the possible rewards
562 far outweighed my phobias.
563 Just think- three months ago, there was no one who had even DREAMED that an
564 agent like Accelerotine was possible.  Dr. Juzem pioneered the research in
565 UNDERGROUND's labs, testing here, fiddling there- until now.
566 Accelerotine was about to be administered to a human patient.  Me.
567 Dr. Juzem turned with an injection gun held prominently in his right hand.
568 My stomach turned a few more flip-flops before it settled again.  God, how I
569 hate needles.
570 "This won't hurt a bit, Harry.  Just relax.  It may sting for a bit, but
571 that's normal.  Ready?"
572 "Get on with it, Doc, I ain't got all day."  My reply belied the anxeity I
573 really felt.  "The world's waitin' for Accelerotine."
574 He smiled agaiin, but didn't say anything.  He held the gun up to my right arm,
575 and squeezed the trigger.
576 Pain lit up in my arm, but just for a moment.  What really worried me was
577 the plain fact that I couldn't see.
578 Well, I could, a little.  But seeing nine-foot long snake-creatures slither
579 by you while the other scenery resembled the backdrop of a B horror flick
580 isn't what *I* would call seeing.
581 "Whoa, Harry, bad reaction.  Ignore what you're seeing.  No matter how bad it
582 is, it's not real.  This will pass."
583 I hardly heard him.  A giant insect creature that rather looked like a praying
584 mantis with eight forelegs turned its head toward me as if he were considering
585 if I should be on the menu.  I guess I didn't look to appetizing- he turned
586 it back.
587 "Harry?  Can you hear me?" Dr. Juzem called.
588 "Y..yes, I can.  Uh, is this going to wear off SOON?"
589 "In another moment or two.  How do you feel otherwise?"
590 "A little dizzy, really.  Is that normal?"
591 "I'm not sure.  You're my first human 'guinea pig'.  When you can, get dressed
592 and into bed.  You'll be observed for a few days."
593 My sight cleared up just well enough by now to make out Dr. Juzem leave the
594 room.  My clothes lay on the bed just a few feet away.
595 I reached for them.  Suddenly, my vision became perfectly clear, although
596 slightly red-tinted.  The clothes seemed to fly up at me, or was I flying down
597 to them? {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{Harry Foster, UNDERGROUND}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}
