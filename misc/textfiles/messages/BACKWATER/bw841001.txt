21 Grand D;
22      If you're still around, how about starting a story line.  The Inn is
23 very boring.  Perhaps we can liven things up.

29 The Poet sighed as he sipped his ale. Long ago the Inn had been a fascinating place to spend an evening. Granted,
30 things got a bit violent at times, but it had been interesting nevertheless.
31 Now most of the crowd who remained at the Inn seemed to be content to let their beards hang in their mugs, while
32 adolescents and rodents dominated the scene. Where, he thought, have Pam, d, and the others of beautiful voice
33 gone? Only his friend Piper seemed interested in the song of life anymore. Even McKane or Gaius would be welcome,
34 he thought, and reflected for a while on how low he'd sunk to be thinking such things. Ah well. As he sipped and
35 thought, a flicker passed into his clouded mind. Perhaps a discussion of the unknowable will get the juices flowng
36 again.
37 "Has anyone reflected," he commented, "that all the many realities are nothing more than eddies, momentary and
38 meaningless fluctuations in that vast and timeless sea which is Chaos?"
39 There. That was bound to offend SOMEONE. Maybe a discussion can come out of it, if nothing else. He noticed his
40 ale was gone, doing its bit in the headlong universal tumble to entropy, and signaled the Innkeeper for another...

43    The piper sat quietly drinking the ale that the apprentice had bought him.
44 "Apprentice -- the spelling is Simmental, I believe.  They are a recent breed
45 brought in as a "dual purpose" animal.  They were to be both a meat and milk
46 breed... I don't know of anyone who has successfully milked one, however.
47 Lassie, the calf's mother, is a Jersey-Guernsey cross and gives very rich milk.
48 The skimmed milk we drink tastes just about twice as rich as the 3.8% "rich
49 milk" sold in stores.  (This after we have taken nearly a quart of cream off
50 the top of a gallon!)  She still has her horns, also.  We purchased her from
51 a dairy that had a Holstien milking herd, but kept a few Jerseys, Gurnseys, and
52 crosses for their own and friends milk supply.  She is a small cow (still a 
53 very large animal) with a mild and pleasing disposition.  Excuse the spelling
54 errors, please.  I just did the terrible deed to Sweetie's horn buds and have
55 her penned away from her mother.  Her mother has been objecting vocally all
56 night long!  Sweetie is growing quickly and soon will pass the "sweet little
57 calf" stage.  Her lessons are progressing nicely -- I haven't had to use the
58 tractor yet, but in a month or two I may need to....
59   The piper took a long drink of ale and looked about the common room of the 
60 Inn.  The room seemed cluttered somehow.  The patrons had been trying to keep
61 the place clean and picked up, but it seemed to lack a certain polish.  The 
62 huge central fireplace had more ashes in it than was really necessary, stains
63 on the stonework showed where overfed fires had sped smoke into the room.  The
64 wooden steps leading up to the front door squeaked when you trod on them, and 
65 the dishes placed near the entrances to the small fuzzy animals' domicile 
66 really needed washing.  He turned back to the apprentice and sighed, "Milchar
67 was trying to get someone to travel with him to the Ruby Valley, but seemed to
68 get no takers.  I cannot go until my domestic duties are taken care of.  You
69 might check and see if he has left yet, and if he is how he is getting on."

77      The  door of the Inn swung loosly on its hings.   The  floor 
78 inside  was  littered with leaves and  dirt.   A  vagrent  breeze 
79 chased  small dust swirls about the room.   A dark pensive figure 
80 peers  tenativly  around the oak frame,  then  quickly  was  gone 
81 again.   A small scurring sound soon followed.   A ragged curtain 
82 drawn across a doorway in the rear rippled slightly in the breeze 
83 and was still.  
84      A  deathly silence filled the Inn,  a stagnent mustyness  of 
85 long disuse prevaded difted in the air.   What had become of this 
86 once active hostle?  What great disaster has caused its people to 
87 abandon it?  
88      The  glasses and utensiles lay scattered amongst the dust on 
89 the  tables.   The  bar  was streaked with  long  dried  liquids.  
90 Cobwebs could be found in every convenient corner and crevace.
91      Where is the Innkeeper to maintain his abode?  And where  is 
92 the  barmaid  to clean the tables?   What great Ill has  happened 
93 here?  Where have the people gone?
94      A  dark  shadow  seems to settle over the  Inn,  as  a  lone 
95 wispered sob from long ago echoed from the walls. ....Emer?..... 
96      The  door  swung idly from its rusted hings,  and  the  wind 
97 slapped a loose shutter against the wall.  
98      I wonder if I will ever see my dear friend again.

140 Face it Tarn... Emer is gone.
141 You've been looking for Emer for most of this year without any sign. perhaps it's time to find another.
142 Believe me, I know what you're feeling... but there's a time in life for attachments to fade into fond memories,
143 and this may be it. Perhaps a bit of adventure to take your mind off of it... I hear that Milchar is getting up a
144 party. As for myself, I'll keep looking for a cold-cure at the bottom of my ale-mug, and get out of the Innkeeper's
145 way and let him clean up the mess that the Inn is in (Gee, I must be drunk... never noticed the place was in such

162 Inspired by Tarn...
163 Milchar was depressed.  No one seemed to be interested in the journey, and he hated to travel alone.  Company makes any
164 journey lighter, and Milchar feared the ever-darkening roads would need the good cheer... 
165 "I HAVE HAD IT!!!", yelled Milchar, in a sudden eruption of emotion.  Hurriedly, he rummaged around in his robes for his
166 box of 3 x 5 cards.  Finding it, he quickly shuffled through them as if he were afraid he might change his mind... a 
167 strange warmly-colored yellow card popped into view, and Milchar read from it... "Have a Nice Day!"
168 With those words, the warm glow from the card expanded, grew to encase the whole room in good cheer.  Dust disappeared.
169 The walls were spic and span again.  A fire began to burn in the hearth.  And Milchar began to tell a story.  It went
170 something like this:
171 A long time ago, a group of people were engaged in their favorite activity.  But they became jaded, too used to 
172 extraordinary efforts and felt that fair efforts were a little below par.  They met an old man, however, who was 
173 never bored, never jaded.  They asked him his secret, and he told them, "I just pay attention, look about, and 
174 LOOK, LISTEN, and THINK.  Everything is new and wonderful to me because I look at it in a fresh way.  I believe that 
175 everything is wonderful because it is UNIQUE.  And unpredictable.  All you need", he added, "is just a different 
176 viewpoint."  And with that, the old man left.  The people learned from him and were never bored again, as they had 
177 learned to value each other more.
178 Sighing deeply, and gazing with sleepy approval at the now spotless common, Milchar said weakly, "Now won't anyone 
179 help me try to improve matters?"
180 With that, Milchar slept.

185    The piper looked approvingly at the improvements that Milchar's spell wrought
186 in the ambience of the Inn.  
187   "Yes, Milchar," he said, "our world is what we percieve it to be.  If we
188 percieve it as stagnant and boring, it is, indeed, stagnant and boring.  It was
189 a greek philosopher, I believe, who said that 'you never step in the same river
190 twice' -- meaning that each act you perform is unique in it's time-space 
191 location."  He looked about the room, peering into the corners and crevices
192 looking for the vast herds of lurkers that usually wandered through.
193 "Come!  Let's shake off this lethargy.  I have someone else to tend the cattle,
194 defend the home front, and keep the home fires burning.  I am for adventure!"
195   The piper looked at his companions around the table, obviously underwhelmed by
196 his sudden change of mood.  He nudged Milchar awake and said, "Come now!  You've
197 cleaned the cobwebs out of my mind as well as the corners of the common room.
198 I, for one, am ripe for a journey.  Perhaps the bard would come in search of a
199 new song, and the apprentice in search of new knowlege!"
200   "By the way, apprentice.  True cream does not pour -- you have to spoon it
201 into a cup!"  The piper smiled and took another drink of his coffee.

204 I've watched this system and noticed a trend. Several long-
205 time users are reminicing the 'good-old days when'. This
206 behavior is very similar to the abated mentality found in
207 nursing home. This board is a tool for the future, a place
208 to develop and explore new ideas. If the past doesn't continue
209 to the present, accept it as ended but not forgotten. The
210 past is a thing of memories and serve well the aged mind. Our
211 youthful minds are a treasure.

226 Let's see, Milchar, Milchar.  Oh ! MILCHAR The adventurer.  I think I too am
227 ready for adventure.  "Ho! Milchar!  Could you use a stalwart mind and somewhat

281     Mummmmmmm, he breathed out in a long sigh of pleasure, drinking in the
282 glory and beauty of this most exquisite of days. Sunshine, salty breezes,
283 and an infinite horizon all around, seemed to the give the mind room to
284 expand. His friend, the lady 'Southwind', danced across the waves, carried
285 before the trade winds by a billowing cloud of canvas. Picking up her skirts
286 to rush down the face of a wave, climbing to the peak of the next one with a
287 gentle swoosh, then repeating in a smooth flowing cycle guaranteed to induce 
288 ecstasy. The feel of a fully found schooner running "full 'n by" is truly
289 beyond mere words.
290 
291     Slowly he tilted his head back, letting his eyes follow the sweeping  
292 curve of the sails, as they stretched upward to the better part of infinity.
293 Simultaneously his mind reached out embracing both remembered past and
294 imagined future. Ah! yes, what was it the dolphins had said that full moon
295 night, about twelve days south-west of the Azores?                           
296   
297       Into that which you name the 'PAST' you place those 
298       things that you perceive as experience and destiny.
299       Into that  which you  name the  'FUTURE'  you place
300       all those  things  that you  perceive  as  freedom. 
301       Where  are you standing  when you  see all of this?
302   
303     Why of course, he like every other human being was the link between past
304 and future. Or maybe it was more like a window. If so a little timely glass
305 cleaning now and then couldn't hurt a thing. Certainly that was one of the 
306 reasons he had set out on this long, single-handed passage. What had he
307 learned from this beauty and solitude? One thing for sure, no matter how
308 beautiful a scene, it was always richer when shared with friends.
309 
310     Suddenly his memory shifted to good times with friends at the Backwater
311 Inn. How many of them, he wondered, were there now, laughing, telling
312 stories, and planning great new adventures. His heart warmed at the thought.
313 It must be time to set a course for that sheltered cove not too far from the
314 Inn. Yes, with fair winds and smooth seas he could be there in a few days.
315 "Stand-by to jibe!", he called out to himself.

319 This episode takes place before Milchar and his 'group' take off for the Ruby
320 Valley.  
321      Milchar is gathering new 'recruits' for an adventure.  Off in the corner
322 of the Inn, a faint whirring is barely audible.  A British Police Box then 
323 appears out of nowhere.  These people are not surprised, though.  They know 
324 that this thing belongs to the legendary Doctor.  The doors open and a green
325 costume man is thrust out.  The Doctor then emerges.  'Milchar, old friend,
326 I heard that you were looking for someone to afccompany you on a journey to the
327 Ruby Valley.  I am afraid to say that I am unavailable at the 'time', but 
328 take this pest with you, please!!  I would be in your debt for a long time.
329 His name is, get this, A. Bug...'  Milchar looks at his old friend and says
330 nothing.  The Doctor then leaps into the Tardis.(NA mean trick for a guy 750
331 years old...)  The Tardis vanishes from sight.  Under his breath Milchar 
332 replies 'I'll get you for this...Why me?!?!?!?'

362 ===============================================================
363 With new events occuring everyday, it seem such a waste of time
364 to rekindle such a dull and directionless story line. However,
365 a number of 'old-timers' will persist. Take time to scan through
366 these stories because I've caught glimpses of true insight and 
367 humor. Some users have much to offer and I'am excited to read
368 their ideas.
369 I've got a theory concening the people in RED. Most young people experience a period of self-awareness and struggle to find a
370 method to adjust (find themselves). Those unable to find answers continue to search for 'meaning'. If the search continues
371 and no answers are found, then someone with mystical or religious connections offers hope. To enhance the effect, religious or
372 mystical leaders create a group of followers which come to act
373 as peer group. The 60's produced a similar group of people that
374 clung to various "ism's". There is comfort when surrounded by
375 others with the same feeling, even if the shared emotion is 
376 discontent or lack of direction. The people in RED have united
377 to garner strenth and support even though the individual is 
378 weak and lost.
379 Have pity for the individual, but be wary of the group. Within
380 the group are people with goals and ambitions. They can mold
381 the thinking and actions with powerful psychology.
382 The interaction of religion and politics allows for broad
383 interpetation. The law and our judical system are unaffective
384 or afraid to challenge the rmotives and methods of religion.
385 So for now, we watch and wait hoping for a LARGE blunder.

388 Perhaps, I am not overly believing in what the Rash's say, as
389 all to often it consists of double talk and manipulated truth.
390 Too many odd and unusual occuances. Odd that so close to election
391 Too many odd and unusual occuances. Odd that they would be so quick to
392 sue for defamation. Odd that so close to election time 
393 that they would suddenly decide to be kind to the street people.
394 Odd that they are happy to bus them in for free, but not help them
395 if they want out. If they were truly interested in the welfair
396 of these people would they not help them survive anyway? Even
397 the Christian services do that much. (And in fact it looks like
398 the Christian services are having to take the recovery load 
399 anyway. I am NOT impressed.) And of course one wonders if they
400 'really' are a peacful lot, why do they need semi-automatic
401 rifles for their police force? Even the Portland police force
402 manages to get by with out making an agressive showing of such
403 weapons. On the flip side of the coin, all new religions go thru
404 a period of intense public disapproval as they startup. The Mormons
405 got kicked out of their home state for practicing aspects of life
406 that their nieghbors found unacceptable. Jesus got nailed for 
407 promoting a way of life that others found objectionable. In time
408 the religions abate their extreem positions on life and intigrate
409 their ideas and structure in a form that the general populance can
410 accept. If they don't, they don't survive. Of course some of them
411 take care of the problem themselves by self-removal. Remember
412 Jamestown in Africa?
413 To quote Socraties (sp?) "Me thinks thou protests too much".
414 At least that's my view of them.

417 WELL, FRIENDS, IT SEEMS THAT THE IN IS PREPARING FOR ADVENTURE AGAIN. I AM SORRY THAT I CANNOT GO, FOR I AM PRESENTLY 
418 QUARTERED IN THE GRAND OLD TOWN OF CORVALLIS, AS A SOMEWHAT STUDENT AT O.S.U.. HOWEVER, IT IS NICE TO LOOK IN AND SEE
419 THE INN IS STILL FUNCTIONING. AND AS FOR THE RASHNEESHIES, THERE ARE THOSE I HAVE MET DOWN HERE FOR WHOM THE THREAT IS
420 CLOSER THAN PURE ACADEMIC DISCUSSION, THOSE WHO LIVE CLOSE TO THEM. TO THERE POINT OF VIEW, THE PROBLEM IS NOT WHEATHER
421 THE BAGWAN IS HERE LEGALLY OR NOT, THE PROBLEM IS HOW TO GET HIM OUT.(AND IF SPELL CHECK STRIKES ME HERE, I'LL KILLLLLL
422 IT)+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++000000001TED++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
423 Cistop Mikey; I DO SO HOPE YOU WERE NOT MAKING ANYTHING LIKE A PUN WITH THE STATEMENT ABOUT JESUS CHRIST BEING NAILED.
424 Sincerely,
425 Puritan Value
426 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

428    The piper looked about the room, noticing more and more people coming
429 awake and deciding to join in the adventure.  Smiling, he turned to Milchar,
430   "Well, you have started something now!"  Lifting his glass, he drained the
431 dregs of his drink, then began playing "The Black Bear Hornpipe" -- the quick
432 strains seemed to jump and infuse the room with excitement.
433 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
434   Mikey -- If I were a rajneeshy, and were able to read, I'd damn well have
435 a LOT of automatic rifles and a hell of a lot of other armament as well.
436 Somehow I think most of them CAN read...
437   A fundamental problem is that Americans (and most of them are, indeed, 
438 americans) can go anywhere in this country, settle anywhere they want, and
439 purchase homes without the seller being allowed to discriminate because of
440 color, RELIGION, or national origin.  Let's look at the whole thing from a
441 different perspective -- If Jesse Jackson were to take the money it took him
442 to run a political campaign and bought a ranch in eastern Oregon and a bunch
443 of Rolls-Royces -- see what I mean?
444   If anyone refused to serve them in a cafe, refused to rent them a hotel room,
445 refused to sell them a home...  The rajneeshys are ready to sue at the drop
446 of a hat.  Somehow they haven't caught onto that one yet -- or have they?
447   Ask any of the southern states about the power of the Feds when it comes to
448 any of the civil rights that we approved when they were voted in.  When someone
449 puts on red clothes, they don't take off those civil rights.  If there are 
450 more of them than you, you get outvoted even if you are "right".  I don't 
451 wholeheartedly approve of the group, but I think a lot of people are setting
452 up themselves and the state and county governments for a real fall.  Remember -
453 if you have the right to tell a rajneeshy he has to get out of the state, the
454 bible thumping christians have the right to run out all of you sinning 
455 non-tithing heretics and idolators also!
456 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

458 In other words, this is America where you are free to do what you want
459 within the limits of the law.  The only way to defeat these people is
460 unfortunately in the courts -- any other way (i.e. using violence) 
461 reduces us to savages.  There is a kind of catch-22 in our system as
462 it is currently portrayed, because each time the Baggie goes to court,
463 we the taxpayer pay for it.  When it comes out of your pocketbook,
464 that is when it hurts.

469 Most certainly, I agree. Of course, the weapons point was more of a
470 snide remark, since as I say if they really are a peacful lot they
471 wouldn't need them. There is more then just non-violence to being
472 peacful. This includes respecting others rights and property. This
473 goes beyond just the strict physical aspect drawn up by our laws. There
474 are moral aspects to consider as well. Why did they decide to take
475 over a town? They could have just as well started a new town on theeir
476 own and everyone would have been happy (at least maybe not as upset)
477 It is their agressive and abrasive atittitude that bothers everyone.
478 When was the last time you saw a Quaker carrying a semi-automatic
479 rifle? Yet in many respects they have some very strict ideas about
480 life, and tend to build comunitees around themselves. One big difference
481 is that they don't directly mix religion with politics, but that's 
482 a whole nother argument best left for some other time.

501 Yea...and let sleeping bawgs lie. All puns intended. If the threat to the fine
502 citizens of central Oregon were not so great, the whole episode would make a
503 great TV sitcom. Just sit back in your chair and imagine a group of people
504 who have in the space of a couple of years have taken over town, increased its
505 population almost 60 times, placed a larger tax burden on an entire state,
506 been on 60 minutes, been faced by Ed Bradley, put Rolls-Royce single handedly
507 in the black, and done the same for companies who make red dyes. Imagine a
508 group of people who have the largest per capita political cartoon ratio ever
509 known, who's highly trained lawyers have red three piece suits, and have a
510 spokeperson named Ma Prem Sunshine. Imagine dear reader, the second in
511 command, Shiela. Has ever a more foul mouthed diabolical image of a woman
512 ever existed? She is the only person on this good earth to ever rile Ted
513 Koppel. Only she could say "We'll paint Oregon red if we have too." Dear
514 dear Shiela. You are the anthesis of a female Ghandi. Imagine a guru type
515 who wears stocking caps, makes vows of silence on certain subjects, and calls
516 the lawyer who is questioning him "Stupid!". It all seems to unbelievable. It
517 reads like a story from Kafka or Borges. The unthinkable becomes thinkable.
518 The unbelievable becomes believable. And the impossible happens. What's a
519 self respecting rancher in his 4-wheel drive and 30-06 supposed to do? The
520 next thing will be The Bawg on the cover of Time, or worse yet...People. OR...
521 how about Liz Taylor and Bawgwan eloping the Mexico? What a story for the
522 National Enquirer! The Midnight Star can't be far behind. I am waiting for
523 the Rajneesh Cable TV channel to go online. I wonder is Rogers will pick
524 it up?

527 Imagine, if you will, the Bhagwan attempting to do what he has done in Oregon somewhere in the south.  Texas perhaps.
528 It would have come to a head a lot sooner, and I'm afraid that there would have been a lot of corpses to dispose of on
529 both sides.  Oregon is so proud of its tolerant liberal stance that it will bend over backwards for even the most foul-
530 mouthed crazy in the name of religious tolerance.

560 Awaking with a start, Milchar saw that his plea was being answered.  Piper had brightened up considerably, and was 
561 playing his pipes.  Volunteers swarmed left and right... everything was going great until- The Doctor left A. Bug there.
562 At first he was quiet, but soon began a horrible string of puns.  At first, they were only "horrible", but later grew to
563 "painful" status.  Milchar knew this had to stop...
564 To keep his sanity, Milchar moved to a prominent part of the room and spoke.
565 "Please, listen up!  The next time for entry will be in a few days, we haven't much time!  The Nor-gate can be found at
566 this time in Griffin Pass, about two days ride from here.  I doubt that magic could be used to travel there, so we must
567 have horses or some other such transport.  So much to do!  So little time to do it!  Have your things ready to go in 
568 the morn, time passes swiftly!"
569 Milchar stepped down, and almost in a whisper, said, "I thank you again Piper, I lack your elequence for this."  Piper
570 only smiled.  Milchar grinned, and asked the Innkeeper for refreshment for the two of them.  "I'd like to try some of
571 that cream I've been hearing about..."
