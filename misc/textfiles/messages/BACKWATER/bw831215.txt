71 A controversy ?  Everyone knows that Reagan lies, but lying presidents are
72 an American tradition.  Just because he lies, doesn't mean his policies
73 are bad. (necessarily)  We should keep reagan for domestic things, and
74 hire RM Nixon for foreign policy.  And hire J Carter for buffoon.

79 
80 Reagan doesn't lie, and that's the pity. He really doesn't know that
81 the things he says are wrong, so he is just totally misinformed, not a
82 liar. Carter wasn't a buffoon, he just tried to do everything himself,
83 never delegating authority or responsibility. Reagan delegates everything
84 except making speeches and sleeping, and his appointees are mostly fools
85 and special-interest flacks. I wouldn't want to keep Reagan for anything
86 except court jester due to nearly everything about his scabby, leprous
87 personality. And Nixon for foreign policy? His re-establishing relations
88 with China was a good move, but everything else, from his Vietnam policy
89 to his giveaway of power to the oil companies in 1971 (which eventually
90 resulted in the oil "crisis") was a failure. Our nations's foreign policy
91 for the last 40 years has been one of threats, posturing, and bullying,
92 so I can't say that I've seen anyone during that time whose foreign policy
93 I could say I supported whole-heartedly.
94 ************Captain  America************
95 To: All BWMS "non-party" goers
96 Well I enjoyed it, did you?
97 To: Everyone else
98 WHERE WERE YOU??!!
99 Captain America:I at no time advocated running away. (just because someone
100 CALLS himself a survivalist doesn't mean he is one). My position is that 
101 until we can be sure that there is NO danger from these things, we should
102 try to take what precautions we can. The gun-toting idiots that most people 
103 think of when you say "survivalist" are acting in a very non-survival manner
104 It makes more sense to keep a low profile & try to form an integrated
105 community with people who have skills that compliment yours. A small amount 
106 of paranoia may be helpful, but you HAVE to trust someone.

111 I knew the party would be a success! I was very happy to meet all of you.
112 Our small numbers allowed us to all get a chance to talk to each other
113 and get to know each other better. It was really enjoyable! We even had
114 some good mini debates ranging from Reagan to IBM computers. I have a few
115 questions for some of you...
116 Hrothgar...If you were at PSU around 15 years ago, were you involved with
117 or remember any of the Vietnam protests there? What about the FBI scandal
118 that I have heard bits and pieces about? I guess a cousin of mine who went
119 there was quite involved in some of the protests etc. My Aunt was valadic-
120 torian another year, and one of my brothers also went there. Does this
121 constitute a legacy??? Keep me in mind if you have any sub-contract jobs!
122 To Mikey...If you would care to, could you tell us more about the products
123 you carry?
124 To Leonard...I owe you a button...whoops!
125 To DJJ...is your BBS going to be back up? Can you tell us a little about
126 what it covers?
127 To d...Thank you for your stimulating conversation and your Dragon 
128 renditions.
129 To Alex...Thank you for the suggestion of the MT Bottle & Deli. A great
130 place to meet, and the food was good too!
131 To all...good bye!

136 
137 
138 Government officials unofficially deny persistant reports 
139 that coastal towns are being devastated by an infestation 
140 of dragons. However, reports of the rash of unexplained 
141 animal mutilations along the Oregon/Washington coast continue. 
142 
143 Efforts by Oregons new Rumor Control Division to counter 
144 reports of a widening dragon infestation have had mixed 
145 results. The unofficial news blackout continues though charges 
146 are spreading within the media that this constitutes a serious 
147 violation of freedom of the press.
148 
149 The governors of both Oregon and Washington deny the national 
150 guard has been placed on alert. Neither Senators Hatfield or 
151 Packwood have been available for comment on the rapidly 
152 deteriorating crisis.

207    Pam's back!
208 
209   Pam: Thanks for the input. As it stands, the system will permit only a
210 small subset of the commands to be used without logging in. (HELP,?,and a
211 few others) If I were to implement a "trial" section, I would actually have
212 to log the guest in, perhaps under a general well known UID/password combo
213 (such as guest/password). The system will have a large number of mysterious
214 and dark commands, some of great utility and others of little use. To
215 prevent a user from destroying all about him, each user will have a perm-
216 ission list of which commands the system will permit them to use. I could
217 give guest/password only sufficent commands to enter messages into a "room"
218 specificly for them (pgallery). Other rooms will be for different topics/
219 concepts; the system will automaticly create a room if, say, 5 users request
220 its creation. One of the rooms will be "Forum", and is intended for general-
221 BWMS type use. As to creating a subsytem exactly like BW, probably not. The
222 "forum" room will be close (in fact any room) enuf to satisfy everyone. The
223 only (major) difference between BW's free format and my system will be the
224 fact that messages are actually files, and protected from tampering. Once
225 you have entered a room, it will be much the same. Up, down, next message,
226 search...etc.
227  As to the status of the system, a) the software hasn't left paper. b) the
228 computer needs extensive modifications c) i need to hookup a 256k mem board
229 (which i have)  d) i have to get a phone line   e) i need a paper tape punch
230 /reader (i will be using audio tape until/unless i get one)  f) other dreary
231 needs/projects...among them aprox $200 for various components,etc..
232 
233  on the bright side, I actually do have the computer, drives, memory, and
234 modem necessary (103/212A/VA3400), and a good idea of which direction I'm
235 heading. Look for the system to be on-line by Jan 1.
236 
237  Hope to see you at the not-a-pizza party!
238                                                      Aaron
239 [above was transfered to DA, as Mike swapped DB out before you were
240  able to read it........]
241 
242 all: the "spaces" between the lines above are LINEFEEDS, NOT EMPTPY LINES!
243  they were inadvertedly inserted because I didn't have a "non-system" copy
244 of the text. my apologies. (ignore this. I fixed it. see below)
245 
246 all N-A-P Party goers: it was a pleasure! Alex's choice turned out O.K. At
247 least he had the guts to show! (ha ha!) what was the resolution? alternate
248 leap years?..........
249 
250 BAD: nothing is absorbed anymore! (sob, no tricky dialing to keep phone
251 numbers secret..) . line quality is better, but the trasmission losses are
252 higher. I've got a test set here which will inject any db from -30 to plus
253 20 or so at any frequency; maybe I could con the test desk (omigod! there
254 ain't such a beast anymore!) into checking  levels. Have you been following
255 the progress (or lack thereof) of Unicom?
256 
257 Pam (again): you were sorely missed. along with DOM and other no-shows,
258 and that includes you, BAD!
259 
260 all (hints on up-load to BWMS): make sure the margin is set high enuf so
261 the margin bell dosn't ring, as many modems do better with one-way data.
262 Try to get your system to insert LF's AFTER the CR! eithier send each line
263 individually or put a good dozen nulls after each CR, BW is slow!
264 I fixed the extra LINEFEEDS! I defined one of my fuction keys as
265 "do^M^C" and the other as "ch /^J//^M^C" and just popped the 1-2-1-2-1-2...
266 keys till i hit a "not found"..the ^C's prevent the system from echoing
267 the lines when I DO and CH..saves time.
268 
269 DJJ: youv'e got a BB also? finaly figured it out. It must have been
270 T.D.B. claiming TOPS-20, right? ......P-E 550 VDU terminals are definatly
271 not VT-100 compatible. close to TV-925, though. trying to pull VT-52 data,
272 if i can't find it maybe BAD can tell me what cursor-up-dwn-cls-etc. are
273 on a '52 and will check with my P-E.
274 
275 HROTHGAR, the varied: i looked through the service manual and havn't yet
276 found the test stake. I will pull the back off and do some visual checking,
277 but that PC board is a bear to get off! (and on!) ....a pleasure meeting
278 you. Let's get together sometime; I'm certain you would enjoy seeing my
279 "facility" here. Lots of toys/micros/minis. 
280 
281 layde of dragons! :  we finaly meet! after some initial confusion, things
282 went well. You are truly beautiful; in mind, body and spirit! I was pleased
283 that you and the Dark Prince finally got aquainted formaly.

357 POLITICIANS:  An apology
358 
359 We would like to apologize for the way in which politicians
360 are represented in this programme. It was never intended to
361 imply that politicians are weak-kneed political time-servers
362 who are concerned more with their personal vendettas and
363 private power struggles than the problems of government, nor
364 to suggest at any point that they sacrifice their credibility
365 by denying free debate on vital matters in the mistaken
366 impression that party unity comes before the well-being of the
367 people they supposedly represent, nor to imply at any stage
368 that they are squabbling little toadies without an ounce of
369 concern for the vital social problems of today. Nor indeed do
370 we intend that viewers should consider them as crabby ulcerous
371 little self seeking vermin with furry legs and an excessive
372 addiction to alcohol and certain explicit sexual practices
373 which some people might find offensive.
374 
375 We are sorry if this impression has come across.

429    Aaron...questing forth in search of that one remaining undocumented entry 
430 point. Eyes glazed with anticipation.
431    Hrothgar....who I had expected to be going in several directions concurently.
432    Leonard,  whom I had expected to be armed to the teeth ...and yet brought but
433 one instrument of defense.
434    DJJ, DP ,dROPPEd bIt, et al who contribuited to the diverse conversations.
435 Many thanks for the experience.
436  
437    I frequent M&T and on Saturday there were many who were unknown and seemed to
438 be more than casualy interested in the gathering......how many patrons of the 
439 Inn went but stayed in the shadows ?
440  
441    For my own curiosity.... are there any sailors who frequent the Inn ??

448      I HAD STARTED WRITING A NICE LONG TRACT ON "1984" AND FREEDOM OF
449 THE PRESS (OFF-LINE OF COURSE), AND FOUND THAT I'D FILLED UP 4 PAGES AND
450 WASN'T FINISHED!  SO I THINK I'LL LET IT SIT AND TRY TO CUT IT DOWN TO
451 REASONABLE SIZE LATER.  AND I HADN'T EVEN GOTTEN TO BIG BROTHER OR IN-
452 VASIONS OF PRIVACY!  BOY, LONG-WINDED!.......
453 
454      SORRY TO EVERYONE I DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE GET-TOGETHER, BUT IT WAS
455 A COMBINATION OF WEARYNESS FROM LONG HOURS ON THE ROAD THE DAY BEFORE
456 AND UTTER TERROR OF SUCH THINGS THAT KEPT ME AWAY.  I HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME
457 GOING TO PARTIES WHERE I KNOW EVERYONE, AND GOING TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
458 WHERE I'VE ONLY MET OTHERS THROUGH THEIR WRITING....TREMBLE, TREMBLE!  I
459 SEEM TO HAVE GONE BACKWARDS IN THAT WAY, AS WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I HAD
460 NO SUCH FEARS.  OH WELL....
461      AARON, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE THE SYSTEM FAIRLY WELL DESIGNED
462 ALREADY.  I ASSUME THAT YOU ARE USING A VARIETY OF UNUSUAL EQUIPMENT FOR
463 IT, SO THE CODE PROBABLY WON'T BE VERY TRANSPORTABLE.  CORRECT?

471 DEAR PERSON ABOVE: IF ANY OF THAT STUFF WORKS WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO KNOW 
472 HOW. ESPECIALLY MIKEY, PROBABLY. KEEP ON TRYING.
473 
474 TO ALL OF THE PARTY GOERS - THANKS! I HAD A GREAT TIME. HOW ABOUT A
475 PICNIC IN THE SPRING? I ALSO WONDER IF SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE AROUND THE
476 OTHER TABLES WEREN'T LURKING. ONE PERSON ABOVE SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT.
477 
478 AARON: WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE TOYS 'FER SURE', HOW ABOUT AFTER NEW YEARS?
479 
480 ALEX - DIDN'T GET ENOUGH OF A CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU - ARE YOU ALSO IN
481 THE COMPUTER BUSINESS?
482

484 LEAVE NUMBER.

491 .......................................................................
492 Hrothgar, the ?...Yes you have my card. Either call at work or at home,
493 When it comes to programming jobs, I am usually quite reachable.As for
494 lurkers, I can't imagine anyone would stay in the shadows at the MT for
495 long. We certainly didn't look like much of a motley crew, and I don't
496 think we would scare a lurker away. Those other people were probably just
497 passers-bye. When we first got to MT, there were a couple of 'old-salts'
498 sitting at the next table, but they soon left. The others around us were
499 there before we got there, and seemed quite pre-occupied with themselves.
500 To Alex, I would not call myself a sailor, but I used to go sailing once
501 in a while with my uncle, who was quite a sailor. One summer he sailed
502 from Portland to Hawaii alone. Quite an adventure! Nothing compared to
503 the trans-atlantics you read about these days, but still no small feat.

506      It seemed to me that one gentlemen that occupied one of the adjacent
507 tables (reading a newspaper) was very interested in our discussions...
508 perhaps the Apprentice?
509      To all: I had an excellent time, although I was probably the biggest
510 computer novice in the group.
511      Aaron: It was nice meeting you.  I avidly await your new system.
512 With your electronic skills, I'm sure it will be a success.
513      d: We finally meet, I think reality completely outpaced my
514 expectations.
515      Alex: I've done some sailing the last couple of years with my roommate.
516 He has an open sailing dory, built by Schooner Creek Boat Works.
517     All in all I felt the gathering was a success and would like to see
518 it repeated in the future.

523  tHE dROPPED bIT: almost. be sure to dye your hair black, use a gob of
524 brylcream, and wear black hornrim glasses. Don't forget the HP-41CV (next
525 to the slide-rule). But seriously. Which "networks" were you intrested in?
526 CSNET? DARPA? OSSHE? (hardly a net) USENET? 
527  What sort of board does/did DJJ have? You refered to it on LN 125.
528 
529 Peter: will call you tommorow (today?).
530 
531 Pam: Quite possibly Unicom will be more portable than I originally
532 had thought probable. Even though it will be restricted to the same type of
533 machine it was written on, it should port well to other instalations of the
534 same make. I will be writing significantly more of the code in the machine's
535 own OS than I had planned. Should make the system more reliable, yet slower.
536 Will keep you posted.
537 
538 DP: Thanks for the enthusiasm! I hope Unicom goes as well as the not-a-pizza
539 party; it certainly is taking as long to get together!
540 
541 Hrothgar: Done. January it is. I'll start cleaning now. Should be done 
542          by then. Or at least started.....Keep me posted on anything new.

545 i'm new to this system and it seems like a nice place to be. i'm only famili
546 iar with cbm products(c-64) so maybe i'mon the wrong board.however, if there
547 are any other commodore users out there with questions, opinions,or just wan
548 t to talk-leave a message!

551  there are several C64 users on this system, Bob, and I am one of them.
552 Here's my question:
553   Why are SERIAL and CSERIAL options mutually exclusive? Flagging on the
554 SERIAL port occurs only on incoming FLAG transitions, and is self-serviced
555 by appropriate NMI transactions. True, out-shifting is also NMI driven, yet
556 the out-shift driver only (and non-destructivly) toggles in on CHROUT 
557 request to SERIAL, and auto-magicly disintegrates when OUTBUF empties. 
558 CSERIAL exception processing (quit laughing David) is also CHROUT event-
559 driven. Thus, in theory, both SERIAL and CSERIAL should be able to have open
560 files in the OS open file table, and not conflict unless both try concurrent
561 operation. (In fact, if it weren't for timing constraints placed on CSERIAL
562 transactions, the auto-tracking (stack-wise) of multiple interrupts would
563 make CONCURRENT operation possible!) Yet this does not work. Why?
564                                                    Aaron

573 Seriously, I have an EXTREMELY dislike for the "armed to the teeth, gonna 
574 reconquer the world (after the war), etc", so-called "survivalist". You know
575 the people running are the woods in camoflague (sp?) fatigues, scaring 
576 campers & hunters. Rule #1 in survival is DON'T CALL (UNNECESSARY) ATTENTION
577 TO YOURSELF!
578 The only gun I own is a .22 that hasn't been fired in YEARS (15,20?).

582 SO, HERE WE GO AGAIN, DISK A ALMOST FILLED UP AND LOTS OF ROOM ON
583 DRIVE B. GEE, PAM WHAT HAPPENED? I CAN USUALLY COUNT ON YOU AT LEAST 
584 ATTEMPTING TO FILL THIS MESS UP. 
585 AM I TO BE STUCK FILLING IT UP BY MYSELF?
586 I GUESS SO SINCE THERE IS ALMOST NO ROOM LEFT ON DRIVE A 
587 AND IT WILL CERTAINLY BE FULL IN THE MORNING IF NOT BEFORE.
588 SO I GUESS I'LL JUST TYPE AWAY
589 TILL THIS ONE IS FULL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO ARCHIVE IT.
590 YUCK, ONLY LINE 590 GOT LOTS OF LINES TO GO.
591 I WONDER IF I REALY WANT TO DO THIS.
592 I COULD JUST ARCHIVE IT AS IS IN THE MORN, OR TONIGHT.
593 MAYBE I'LL JUST GIVE UP AND DO THAT.
594 CHECK IT ONE MORE TIME BEFORE I GO
595 TO BED, AND THEN IF IT IS NOT FULL YET WAIT
596 TILL MORNING. CAUSE THIS IS REALLY BORING.

602      SORRY, MIKEY, I KNOW THAT I NORMALLY AM THE ONE TO FILL THESE DISKS
603 UP AT THE END, BUT I WAS HOPING THAT SOMEONE ELSE OUT THERE KEPT UP WITH
604 WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE END OF THE DISKS AND WOULD ADD A COMMENT OR TWO.
605 SO DISK A IS ALREADY UP TO LINE 627, AND THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF LINES
606 LEFT HERE.  <SIGH>....
607      I WAS PLANNING ON ENTERING SOMETHING ON DISK A, BUT IT FILLED UP SO
608 QUICKLY THAT I WAS UNABLE TO.  NO ROOM!!  BUT I KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE
609 A NEW DISK TOMORROW, SO THERE WILL BE TIME AND SPACE FOR MY WANDERINGS.
610 
611      LEONARD PROBABLY WON'T SEE THIS, BUT I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR THE
612 INTERESTING TEXT HE SENT TO BW.  IT TOOK UP A LOT OF SPACE, BUT IT'S NICE
613 TO SEE MORE INFORMATION FROM ANOTHER SOURCE BESIDES OUR OWN LITTLE COM-
614 MENTARY.  THE "HACKER" PHENOMENON IS ONE I FIND BOTHERSOME, AS IT MAY
615 PUT AN END TO ON-LINE COMPUTER FUN (SUCH AS THIS) IF IT CONTINUES UNCHECKED.
616 I HOPE THAT HE (YOU, IF YOU DO READ THIS LEONARD) UPLOADS IT TO ANOTHER
617 BBS (SUCH AS CBBS) WHERE IT CAN BE KEPT AS A DOWNLOAD FILE FOR OTHERS TO
618 SEE AND USE.  I KEEP HARD-COPY OF EVERYTHING I CAN FROM THIS SYSTEM, AND
619 EVERYTHING OF INTEREST (TO ME) FROM OTHERS, BUT THE OL' BW DOESN'T KEEP
620 ANYTHING AVAILABLE BEYOND 2 TO 4 DAYS (AND SOMETIMES LESS THE WAY THINGS
621 GO WHEN WE GET A SUBJECT PEOPLE GET HOT ABOUT), SO IT WOULD BE BEST TO
622 FILE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE TOO.
623 
624      ARRGH!!  LINE 624 OF 629!!  THERE JUST ISN'T ANY ROOM LEFT HERE (OR
625 ON THE OTHER DISK) FOR ME TO WRITE ANYTHING OF MAJOR INTEREST, SO I GUESS
626 I'LL JUST SIGN OFF FOR NOW.
627 GOOD GRIEF, IT'S LATE!!!!
