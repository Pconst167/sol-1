21 Wow!  I get to start a new disk, BIG DEAL!
22 
23 TO PUZZELED:  If Russia wants to take
24 over countries like Germany and Italy, let them.
25 The US shouldn't worry about communist countries.
26 If Russia did take them over we would not feel the efectts.
27 But when they start trying to take places
28 like The big oil countries, thats when we start fighting.
29 
30   And non the less, WE DON'T NEED TO DESTROY THE WORLD.
31 If we do that then what we were fighting
32 over is no more.

50 CAPTAIN NICE      by Paul Aurandt
51 	Bartholemew Roberts was an old-time sea captain.
52 	Yet if your conception of what an old-time sea captain is supposed to be includes being boistrous, rough-talking, hard-drink
53 ing, irreverent, then maybe you'd better hear THE REST OF THE STORY.
54 	Once upon a time, ship's musicians were among the hardest-working crew members.  Like the family physicians of long ago,
55 they were always 'on call.'  If anyone aboard ship wanted music, at any time of day or night, they ship's orchestra was
56 required to provide music.
57 	The man who changed all that was Captain Bartholemew Roberts.  Aboard his ships, the Fortune, the Good Fortune, and the 
58 Royal Fortune, the musicians were not only allowed but obliged to take Sunday off.
59 	You see, Captain Roberts' background was conservative Welsh.  He was a strict Sabbatarian.  Once a week on every cruise, 
60 religious services were conducted.
61 	Temperence was another of Captain Roberts' convictions.  The hours during which crew members could drink beverages containing
62 alcohol were carefully regulated.  Alcoholism, or even common intoxication, was positively prohibited.  As for himself, 
63 Captain Roberts drank tea.  ONLY tea.
64 	Games were permitted aboard---unless money was involved.  Any form of gambling was against regulations.  In fact, the captain
65 frowned on games such as cards or dice, simply because those games were generally associated with gambling.
66 	There is no record of a woman ever having been smuggled aboard any of Captain Roberts' vessels by any member of his crew.  
67 The reason is obvious:  The captain made it clar that any member of such immoral behavior would be hanged.
68 	I don't know if Captain Roberts ever conducted a bed check of those serving under him.  There was, however, a standing order:
69 lights out by 8:00 P. M.
70 	Of course, no fighting was allowed.  This was the way Captain Roberts handled it:  If two crew members had a quarrel which 
71 could not be resolved through discussion, they were required to wait until the ship had reached port, then to settle their 
72 dispute on land in a fair fight refereed by the ship's quartermaster.  Under no circumstances was such violence to be permitte
73 d on board any vessel commanded by Captain Roberts.
74 	If this discipline was remarkable for the high seas of the early eighteenth century, Roberts himself was a remarkable man, 
75 always superbly groomed, splendidly attired.  He wore a rich crimson damask waistcoat and trousers, a red feather in his 
76 tricorn hat, two pairs of pistols on the end of a silk sling over his shoulders, a gleaming sword at his side, and a gold 
77 chain suspending a diamond cross around his neck.
78 	Captain Bartholemew Roberts.
79 	Those serving in his command called him "pistol-proof," a phrase used to describe only the most adept in ship-handling, crew
80 control, and the tactics of naval warfare.
81 	No telling what greatness he might have achieved on the right side of wrong.
82 	For Captain Bartholemew Roberts  was a strict Sabbatarian, a teetotaler, a gentle man who disapproved of fast money and loose
83 women.  He was Mr. Discipline, Captain Nice.  And he captured more than four hundred ships during one four-year period in his
84 career.
85 	As a PIRATE.
86 	One of the most feared---and often considered the greatest---pirate in the history of piracy.
87 	Bartholemew Roberts.
88 	The original "Black Bart."

176   CRAZY!  I must have really done it this time!  And what about this fellow

200 FOTI:	I hate to be the one to burst your bubble, but while Italy's government
201 is NOMINALLY communist, Germany's is NOT. In any case, just because they CALL 
202 themselves communist, that doesn't mean that they are the same as the government
203 of the USSR. By the way, the government of the USSR is NOT communist. What they
204 have is more properly called "state capitalism".
205 	And as for our not noticing if they took over West Germany and Italy, you had
206 better check out some facts. Just off the top of my head I can tell you that the
207 electronics business would go thru a crisis. It seems that about 50% of the raw
208 hyper-pure silicon used outside of Japan comes from a company in West Germany. I
209 happen to work for a US subsidiary of the firm in question. There are other
210 things just as crucial in ANY non-third world nation you care to name. And in 
211 many third world nations, there are vital resources -- such as the oil you 
212 mentioned. The modern world is too interdependent for isolationism.
213 	The only reasons that the USSR hasn't invaded Europe yet are:
214 1. They aren't certain that we wouldn't start firing off nukes.
215 2. Their conventional forces in the area "only" outnumber NATO forces about 2:1.
216 Most strategists feel that one should have odds of 5:1 when attacking someone
217 who is defending their "home turf". The Soviet military is noted for being
218 cautious. (see this month's Scientific American for a more detailed analysis. I
219 think that it understates the Soviet position, but it should still help)

221 	"Milord innkeeper, I must apoligize for failing to 'turn off the 'demon' that I
222 was using in that joke on d. I fear that it has grown a bit too large to just
223 idly dismiss. Luckily, since its breed feeds on disorder, I think we can work 
224 this out in an equitable manner." said the apprentice.
225 	He had drawn the innkeeper aside shortly after entering the Inn. The innkeeper 
226 looked sceptically at him.
227 	"As thou may have noticed, the inn does seem to have a rather large 
228 tendency towards disorder? The demon could 'feed' off of this. The main effect 
229 would be that Pam wouldn't have quite so much to clean up. You might say that th
230 patrons would become somewhat 'non-accident' prone." 
231 	At this the innkeeper displayed some interest, and they started serious 
232 negotiations. Much later the apprentice approached a party at a table..
233 	"Milords, Milady..", he began, "I hear that thou may have need of art
234 such as mine?"
235 	"I have brought my staff, and also some small items which may aid us.
236 Finally, if all else fails I have this.."
237 	He placed a small vial on the table, it contained a number of small
238 blue pills. "I obtained these from some rather odd travelers. I know the names 
239 of two of their number, hast any of thee heard of 'Chester Anderson' or
240 'Michael the Theodore Bear'?"
241 .................................the apprentice.................................
242 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
243    Something is dreadfully wrong!  I don't normally act like this...
244 My mind doesn't seem to work!  I am looking at the table as through a long
245 black tunnel.  There is a loud buzzing in my ears.  The apprentice has
246 just joined the group at the table.  If I can only tell him...
247   "Apprentice ... help!  The ale, ish funny!"
248 The buzzing is louder now.  Those incautious belts of the Glenlivit are
249 combining with whatever it was..... chloral hydrate??
250 With all my strength I try to stand ....
251 "Apprentish ... the ale ... knockout......

318 Aaron,
319        Sorry to hear about the untimely death of Unicom. I was looking forward
320 to a multi-user system. As for a suitable game that would lend its self to 
321 a digital environment may I suggest a modified form of " Risk ". 
322 Where one combined the tactical requirements of Risk with the political 
323 intrigue and alliances that is found with Diplomacy. Perhaps even add Nuclear 
324 warfare as an option. Maybe even a file
325 on each Color--Country as to its intentions - and official stance towards its
326 neighbors ?....

342      Alex, you will need to inquire of a certain Capt`n Barefoot to
343 hear what became of Nila, not I!  I do believe I've seen the damp prints
344 of his feet by the hearth, under another name.  Add my appeal, if you
345 would, for Nila is charming in her innocence; I've wondered what had
346 become of her journey to 'where east begins' as well.

352 thank you for remembering me.  Like the rest, glad you shook off the cold.

354 demise should be honoured!  Aaron, how bedraggled and weary you look from
355 your travels--please, tarry a while by the fire, and refresh yourself.
356 Would you have a hot buttered rum to warm your bones, or mulled cider?

358 when you speak, and the echoes reberverate for days amidst the beams...
359      Mr. Tim, I would attempt to shake your hand, but as I am equally as
360 coordinated as you, I'll be content with smiling!  I was chortling in the
361 corner in delight over your wonderful ego, and I simply had to speak!

371                Graham Chapman and Mrs. Idle are sitting in a restaurant.
372            Terry Jones, the waiter, walks towards them.
373 
374   M. IDLE: Nice here, isn't it?
375   CHAPMAN: Ah, a very good restaurant, three stars, you know.
376   M. IDLE: Really?
377     JONES: Good evening, sir.  Good evening, madam.  And may I say what a
378            pleasure it is to see you here again, sir.
379   CHAPMAN: Oh, thank you. (looking at the menu) Well, there you are, dear.
380            Take a look at that.  The Boffan Cruque is fantastic.
381     JONES: If I may suggest, sir, the Phesent a la Reine, the sauce is one
382            of the chef's most famous creations.
383   CHAPMAN: Mmmm, that sounds good. (to Mrs. Idle) Well, anyway, just have a
384            look.  Take your time. (to the waiter) Oh, by the way, I've got
385            a bit of a dirty fork, could you get me another one?
386     JONES: I beg your pardon?
387   CHAPMAN: Uh, it's nothing.  I've got a fork, it's a little bit dirty.
388            Could you get me another one?
389     JONES: Oh, sir, I do apoligize.
390   CHAPMAN: Oh, no need to apoligize.  It doesn't worry me.
391     JONES: No, no, no.  I do apoligize.  I will fetch the head waiter
392            immediatement.
393   CHAPMAN: Oh, there's no need to do that.
394     JONES: No, no.  I'm sure the head waiter, he will want to apoligize to
395            you himself.  I will fetch him at once.
396   M. IDLE: Well, you certainly get good service here.
397   CHAPMAN: They really look after you, yes. (Michael Palin, the head waiter,
398            arrives)
399     PALIN: Excuse me, sir, madam. (looks at the fork) It's filthy!  Garcon,
400            find out who washed this up and give them their card immediately!
401            No, better still, we can't afford to take any chances, sack the
402            entire washing-room staff.
403   CHAPMAN: Look, I don't want to make any trouble.
404     PALIN: No, please, it's no trouble.  It's quite right, though, you
405            should point these kind of things out.  Garcon, tell the manager
406            what has happened immediately!
407   CHAPMAN: No, no, please.  I don't want to cause any fuss.
408     PALIN: Please, it's no fuss.  We simply wish to assure that nothing
409            interferes with the complete enjoyment of your meal.
410   CHAPMAN: Oh, I'm sure it won't.  It's only a dirty fork.
411     PALIN: I know, and I'm sorry.  Bitterly sorry.  But I know that no apo-
412            ligies I can make can alter the fact that, in our restaurant,
413            you have been given a dirty, filthy, smelly piece of cuttlery!
414   CHAPMAN: It's not smelly.
415     PALIN: It's smelly, and obscene, and disgusting, and I hate it!  I hate
416            it!  I hate it!  Nasty, grubby, mangey, dirty little fork! (Eric
417            Idle, the manager, comes in and gestures Palin away.)
418      IDLE: Good evening, sir.  Good evening, madam.  I'm the manager.  I've
419            only just heard.  May I sit down?
420   CHAPMAN: Yes, of course.
421      IDLE: I want to apoligize humbly, deeply, and sincerely about the fork.
422   CHAPMAN: Oh, no need.  It's only a tiny thing.  You couldn't see it.
423      IDLE: Oh, you're good, kind, fine people for saying that.  But I can
424            see it.  To me it's like a mountain, a vast bowl of pus!  It
425            gets me here. (hits his chest) I can't give you any excuses for
426            it.  There are no excuses.  I've been meaning to spend more time
427            in the restaurant recently, but I haven't been too well.  Things
428                aren't going very well back there.  The poor cook's son has
429                been put away again, and poor Mrs. Delrimper who does the
430                washing up can hardly move her poor fingers.  And then there's
431                Gilberto's war wound.  But they're good people, and they're
432                kind people, and together we were beginning to get over this
433                dark patch. There was light at the end of the tunnel, when
434                this, when this happened! (he puts his head in his hands and
435                starts to cry)
436       CHAPMAN: Could I get you some water?
437       E. IDLE: It's the end of the road! (John Cleese, the cook, comes out
438                with a meat cleaver)
439        CLEESE: You bastards!  You vicious, heartless bastards! (Chapman laughs
440                as if it's all a practical joke) Look what you've done to him!
441                He's worked his fingers to the bone to make this place what it
442                is!  And you come in with your petty, feeble quibling, and you
443                grind him into the dirt!  This fine, honorable man who's boots
444                you are not worthy to kiss!  Oh, it makes me mad.  Mad. (he
445                throws the cleaver into the table) Mad.
446         PALIN: Easy Mongo, easy!  Mongo! (grabbing his head) Oh, the war wound!
447                The wound!  The wound!
448       E. IDLE: It's the end!  It's the end!! (stabbed himself with the fork)
449        CLEESE: He's dead!  You killed him! (Cleese retrieves the cleaver and
450                lifts it to attack Chapman but Palin stops him)
451             PALIN: Mongo!  Never kill a customer.  Oh, the wound!  The wound!
452                    (Cleese tries to kill Chapman again but Jones runs in and
453                    tackles him and they fly across the table)
454 
455                    And now, the punchline...
456 
457           CHAPMAN: Lucky we didn't say anything about the dirty knife.

469 LEONARD:  I was not exactly trying to be
470 factual, I was trying to make a point.
471 And the last I heard East Germany was communist and had
472 very little to do with our economy.  Learned that in
473 social studies you know.
474 But my point was, you can't solve anything
475 by destroying the world.  Except maybe peace (or maybe Pieces, millions of
476 little PIECES!).

484 
485 FOTI, as i recall, you had indicated of Russia taking over Germany.
486 now since Russia already has control of East Germany, i think that Leonard
487 was save to assume that you were speaking of West Germany which Russia 
488 doesn't currently control (though they would like to very much, and
489 have continually stated so). However, be that as it may, thinking logically
490 doesn't help a whole lot when dealing with large super governments such as 
491 the US and Russia. Keep in mind that they have a vested interest in maintainling
492 control over the various contries for a number of reasosns, one as you pointed
493 out, the need to keep the source of their resorces in freindly hands.
494 But also, the desire to have others believe in the same way of life as
495 they do. They are no different then religonites in that respect, and is
496 problably why the two have gone hand in hand so often in the past.
497 A good way to view the two countries, is to think of them as a couple
498 of street gangs defending their turf, and trying to expand that teritory
499 whereever possible. SUre it aiN't logical to blow the world to smitherens,
500 but who ever said the world was run in  a logical manner?

502 Black and yellow stars floated before the Poet's eyes as he tried to focus
503 his attention on what the Piper was saying.
504 "The ale? Yerrsss, itbf'S stglrongler thann yushull..."
505 He had to stop at that point, because someone was flashing the lights. This
506 struck him as odd, for as all actors know it's nearly impossible to flash 
507 candle-and-lamplight. Flicker, yes; flash, no. He was attempting to comment
508 on this to Graymalkin when the room began spinning, and he was sucked down 
509 into blackness...

511 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

514 a thought drifting in blackness..
515 the apprentice reality pills.
516 ...hairy fishnuts.......NO!!...the thought was too mutch
517 ....flying fish
518 ......blackness
519 
520 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
521 	The apprentice, realizing that the ale had been drugged spun into action.
522 He made a few gestures (later onlookers would claim that his hands seemed to
523 flicker in and out of existence), and spoke an incantation under his breath. The
524 room seemed to recede into the distance and then snapped back into sharp focus.
525 	As the drinkers straightened up, he spoke; "I'm sorry but I had to remove ALL 
526 the foriegn substances in your bodies, what a waste of good liquor..." 
527 	"I suggest that we continue this discussion in private," raising his voice, 
528 "Milord innkeeper, we shall be using the OTHER back room."
529 	"But there isn't..." began the innkeeper. The apprentice raised an eyebrow,
530 paused and then winked. The innkeeper finished," Very well, whatever you say."
531 He turned away muttering something about "people changing the inn all the time."
532 ...................................the apprentice...............................
533 Aleph-null bottles of beer on the wall,
534 Aleph-null bottles of beer.
535 Take one down, pass it around.
536 Aleph-null bottles of beer on the wall.
537 
538 	The bard broke off the song he had been singing (for some time it seemed) and
539 looked around. The ale... there must have been something in it..
540 
541 	His head clear now, he observed the exchange between the apprentice & the 
542 innkeeper with a smile. Rising to join the others in moving to "the OTHER" (?!) 
543 backroom, he suddenly remembered a request that d had made just before things 
544 started getting weird.
545 	He paused, bowed toward the lady and began.

547 		The Dying Robot (words: Jeff Speiser, tune: Red River Valley)
548 Oh, this lonely old robot is aching,
549 And his parts, they are wearing away.
550 Some new parts he'll soon now be needing,
551 But their cost no one will defray.
552 
553 Oh, my photoreceptors are failing,
554 And my eyesight begins to grow dim.
555 Some new parts they say they are mailing,
556 But my chances begin to look slim.
557 
558 I've been true, I've been brave, I've been loyal.
559 I have met each and every human test.
560 But as soon as this tired body wears out
561 They'll just toss me on the scrap heap with the rest.
