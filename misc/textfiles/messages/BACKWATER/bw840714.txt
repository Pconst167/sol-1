21   Many would claim that I don't even deserve to be on the top.  I have had a
22 friend who has been keeping track on the activities at the Inn in my absence.
23 It seems that my name is cursed because I introduced the ants to the Inn. 
24 Well, my original intention was for about 15 ants, and I would deal with them
25 outside of the Inn.  Somewhere along the line, 15 went to about 150, people
26 moved me all over the place, and somebody put them inside.  When I originally
27 started, I said to have them killed if it was a bad idea, but after that it
28 was out of my hands.
29   I do agree that little misadventure was the start of this lousy phase of the
30 writing.  But you really shouldn't blame me for that, and even if you do, at
31 least spell my name right ( with a "y", not a "e" - Birdmen ).  If you really
32 want me off the system, I will go.  But I will only listen to some of the old
33 timers that I remember and respect, before I do anything. No juvie hunt ( I
34 believe that is spelled correctly ) is necessary.
35   For any who are interested, England was great, I apologize for the waste of
36 space, and I hope you know who this is by now.

41 Hi All,
42 Tuck here.  Doesn't anyone here want to argue?  Have all your
43 minds gone to fetal mush?  Enough of these stories, let's start using
44 the gray matter to field some questions that other people put up,
45 not ones that you made yourself.  Lets see some response!  Or
46 are you all just sitting in your slime pools, concentrating on your
47 story line only.  Do something!

51 RETURN OF TEDDY SALAD! COMING SOON TO A THEATER NEAR YOU! NO ONE
52 OVER 18 ADMITTED WITHOUT LEGAL MINOR.
53 WELL IT IS SO NICE TO BE BACK AGAIN. TO THE NINJA: REMEMBER WHEN YOU AND 
54 YOUR BUDS REVEALED MY NAME? HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I DID THE SAME TO YOU?
55 I KNOW THAT YOU ARE 16 YEARS OLD (JUVIE) AND PROBABLY ALL OF YOUR BUDS ARE 
56 TOO. I HAVE YOUR NAME, BUT I CONCIDER IIT A JUVINILE ACT TO PUT SOMEONE DOWN
57 BY THAT MANNER. SO WATCH YOU STEP, OR I'LL REVEAL THE WHOLE LOT OF YOU!
58 
59 BY THE WAY, I NEVER DID FIGURE OUT WHAT I DID THAT WOULD BE CONCIDERED JU
60 JUVINILE! MAYBE IT WAS TOM TOM ASKING FOR BBS NUMBERS, I DON'T KNOW.
61 IT LOOKS LIKE THIS WORLD WILL NEVER GET RID OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE
62 SKAPE GOATS.
63 OH WELL I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF THIS LETTER IS ADRESSED TO THE NINJA OR
64 THE MAN IN GRAY. YOU ARE BOTH BUDS IN MY BOOK. MAYBE YOU ARE THE SAME PERSON?

90 Way to tell him off, Mig.  Sad that the poor guy thinks that it's age that
91 determines 'juvie' or 'not-juvie'.  
92     Tuck:  Ok, let's talk.  I agree that the government is a monopoly, and
93 that something must be done about it.  But what?  As the biggest monopoly,
94 it makes it the hardest one to change.  But let's digress back to the ATT
95 breakup.  People sure cheered when that went down for the count.  But of
96 late, all anyone can do is complain of how bad the phone situation is
97 now.  What would happen if we decided to radicly (sp?) change  the
98 present government, and found ourselves in the same situation?  Hmmm......

203 The Grizzly:  Why do all you so-called muscular types like tho use violence all the time?  Does it make you feel 
204 superior?  Or is it, most likely, that you are only about 5'5" tall and weigh about 110 lbs?  Violence solves NOTHING!
205 PorSFiS People:  The Doctor will not be attending the Bi-Weekly meeting this 'time'.  Sorry, but I've got a date...
206 Spook Central:  Right, O.K.  I'll give you a call. (Maybe)

213 L'homme: I wasn't planning to.  As you may have noticed, Milchar can't fully control his 'Enchanter' magic.  As for 
214 the sound routine, good.  I'm glad I could have helped.
215 The programming job?  Well, the bills DID go out on the 5th, although I was getting worried there for awhile.  Do you
216 know what it is like to program using a DOS that you only know 85% of the commands?  I'm speaking of ProDOS, that 
217 new DOS for apples.  Documentation seems rare, and I got a memory dump of the commands and see strange creatures like
218 FLUSH and CREATE.  The only reason I'm using it is because it is FAST.  Booting a disk I have under 3.3 took 26 
219 seconds, and the same program on a ProDOS disk took 15.
220 Morby:  Good to see you again.  Sorry you couldn't have gotten into the Wargame on Excalibur.  It really looks like
221 it will be fun to play.

243    The twilight hush had descended, like a presence around the Inn, and
244 voices were subdued, faces thoughtful, when a whispered breeze silently
245 parted the oak doors.  In the courtyard, the horses shifted nervously,
246 jingling the rings on their harnesses, with their ears perked towards the
247 patch of dusky sky between the evergreens.  The apprentice and bard both
248 broke off their murmured conversation to direct alert eyes towards the
249 Backwater's entrance, and in the quiet, the splashing dance of the stream
250 that lived behind the Inn could be clearly heard, almost sounding like a 
251 humming tune, wistful and meloncoly...
From the shimmering half-darkness,
252 a small barefoot figure stepped, her feet arched like dancer's, clad in
253 the purest of white, which billowed slightly as if a gentle wind followed.
254 She hesitated at the doorway, as always, poised as if ready to flee, and
255 probed the gathering with dark eyes.  The apprentice gestured towards a 
256 glass of chilled cider, garnished with an orange slice.  She smiled
257 fondly at him, but shook her head.  A fellow marked Damien II hastened
258 to offer his seat; she curtseyed with a swish of silk, but declined.
259 She inclined her head gratefully at Aaron's exuberant greeting, blushing,
260 and turned especially to seek the Innkeeper in greeting.  
Not many had
261 gathered that evening, but the Inn was never idle long, and conversations
262 resumed, the knot of regulars at the center table being the busiest.
263 The girl took an uncertain step towards them, and a man who reckoned to
264 the name of Joshua proffered a friendly toast, joined by another with a
265 booming voice and lapel marked NET.  L'homme, busy in the middle, cast
266 an annoyed glance over his shoulder at her, and she flushed.  
"I--" she
267 began, but her voice came out as a quavering high note.  Josuah looked
268 expectant, and a few quieted to hear her.  "Excuse me...gentlemen?"
269 This time L'homme turned around, glowering, and his comrades hushed as
270 well.  "Ach, pardon me, sirs:  I owe you all an apology." she stammered,
271 twisting her fingers and darting quick looks at Josuah and L'homme.  She
272 gestured helplessly as they waited:  "Please convey my humble apology also
273 to McKane and associates; I had no right to speak so harshly!  If--if I may
274 explain...talk of murders, violence and lust are what appall me, and that
275 is what prompted my departure in the past.  Joshua, you are right:  as but
276 an occasional visitor, it is no place of mine to cry foul.  My old friend
277 the apprentice even chastised me for my anger; I thank you two for your
278 kindly manner."  
"Its just...when women are mentioned here--" she paused,
279 drawing taller and flashing angry eyes around the circle:  "Who was it,
280 Petrov?!" she spat; "They are tawdry, conniving; altogether disgusting!"
281 Again she stopped, fists clenched and trembling, fury crackling from her
282 like sparks:  "Don't you have any respect for women?  Why do you not
283 seek friendship, intelligence or gentleness in your fantasy women?"
284 
The men drew back in surprise at this sudden transformation, and had
285 no answer immediately.  Searching their faces, she relaxed, and drew
286 "I await your defense, gentlemen!" and a slight smile tickled her mouth.
287 up a rough-hewn bench.  Once more her voice thrummed out in earnestness:
288 joshuajoshuajoshuajoshuajoshuajoshuajoshuajoshuajoshuajoshuajoshuajoshuajoshua
289 Hail, d, and well met!  After such an eloquently delivered apology,
290 what can I say?  Welcome back, and I hope you continue your visits.
291 Your entries supply a delighful bit of color amidst the "my father is
292 bigger than your father," and other such inanities.
293 Regarding Petrov, until he decides to reply for himself, I can offer this
294 potentially mitigating data:  the episode to which you undoubtably refer was,
295 as far as we can tell, only his second offering to the system.  It may have
296 been an experiment to test the limitiations of the audience, to see what framework
297 he had to build within.  Of course, it may also be an alternate personna for
298 an already existing person, seeing what he can do without damaging his own
299 'normal' character.  Since Petrov has been elusive to date, it's hard to say.
300 However, his third entry did back off from the explicitness of the 2nd.
301 Perchance he discovered that he overstepped the bounds.  There was a certain
302 amount of negative feedback regarding it.  Again, it's hard to be sure.
303 Perhaps Petrov would care to comment?
304 Anyway, again Welcome Back  d .

313 RE THE TRIBUNAL. AGAIN---. HE THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THIS ASTHE GYRO CAR WHISKED HIM 
314 ALONG. HE ENETERED HE "CHURCH" A FEW MINUTES EARLY, AFTER HAVING PAUSED TO PSYCHE 
315 HIM SELF OUT, TO PREPARE FOR THE UNPLEASANTNESS. THIS MONTH IT WAS THE INFAMOUS 
316 E-METER----. HE REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD FRANTICALLY TRIED TO TELL PEOPLE THAT THIS 
317 WAS COMING, BUT NO ONE WOULD LISTEN. AND SO IT WAS THAT ON THE 14TH OF JUNE, 1996,
318 THAT THE TRIBUNAL, CONSISTING OF MOON, HUBBARD, THE POPE, BAGWHAN, REVS FARWELL, 
319 ROBERTS, AND VARIOUS AND SUNDRY OTHER SELF STYLED GURUS HAD POOLED THEIR COUNTLESS
320 TRILLIONS, AND BOUGHT THE DECIMATED, FINANCIALLY CRIPPLED UNITED STATES. THE FIRST
321 THING THEY DID WAS TO PASS A LAW THAT EVERYONE HAD TO GO TO CHURCH AT LEAST ONCE  
322 A MONTH, OR BE SUBJECTED TO "RE-EDUCATION". IN A WAY, LIFE WAS BETTER-THERE WAS AL
323 MOST NO CRIME:ALL THE INMATES OF ALL THE PRISONS HAD BEEN GIVEN BRAIN SURGERY, AND
324 ALL FIREARMS HAD BEEN CONFISCATED, AND WERE NOW IN HUBBARDS COLLECTION IN FLORIDA,
325 AND THERE WAS NO LONGER A THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR, AS
326 THE RUSSIANS NO LONGER WANTED TO CONQUER AMERICA. BUT-THERE AS NO REAL FREEDOM. 
327 EVERYONE WAS WATCHED. EVERYONE WAS SUBJECTED TO HUBBARDS LIE DETECTORS. DODLEY, 
328 HOWEVER, HAD LEARNED TO BEAT THE LIE DETECTOR, AND HAD TRAINED A HANDFUL OF TRUSTE
329 D FRIENDS TO ALSO BEAT IT, AND TOGETHER, HEY HAD FORMED AN UNDERGROUND MOVEMENT, 
330 DEDICATED TO FIGHTING THE TRIBUNAL. TOGETHER, THEY HAD MANAGED TO ACQUIRE A PRINT
331 ING PRESS, AND STARTED DISTRIBUTING "HERETIC" LEAFLETS TELLING THE PEOPLE WHO DARE
332 D TO READ THEM THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE WAS THE RESULT OF A COSMIC COITIS 
333 (THE BIG BANG), AND THAT THERE WAS HOPE FOR ALL, IF THEY WOULD HELP FIGHT THE

346 hurt me. Besides, you were looking for a controversy to 
347 discuss.
348      First off, I'm not a bad person. I do church work, run 
349 a boy scout troop, am good to my kids, and am respected by 
350 my friends and neighbors. I'm not some sleeze that lurks in 
351 the bushes looking for innocent little children. I've never 
352 hurt anyone.
353      The only thing unusual about me is that I have strong 
354 sexual feelings for young boys. During most of my adult life 
355 I've had one or two secret lovers. I never forced myself on 
356 anyone, it was always something everyone wanted to do.
357      I know this is something that society disapproves of but 
358 I'm not sure why. My boys enjoy what we do as much as I do. 
359 Often they are the ones who initiate it. Who are we hurting?
360      I don't understand how this can be so bad when it is some-
361 thing that gives everyone so much pleasure. You guys said you 
362 were looking for something to discuss. How about talking about 
363 why society is so uptight about the love between a man and a
364 boy.

370  To Frank: I am going to avoid that discusion altogether.  Take it away Friar
371 Tuck.  Demonstrate morality.   As for Teddy Salad ( who I know, and he isn't
372 very strong - unless I have encountered mistaken identities ), what are you
373 going to do?  It is pointless to talk of violence, unless you have plans to
374 come over here and beat the snot out of me, or anybody else for that matter...

376   The door to the Inn which had been opened often by a sudden influx of 
377 newcomers, opened again slightly, and a shadowy form drifted in.  It's 
378 skeletal features were covered by a semi transparent cloak and forest clothes.
379 The apparition moves towards the sleeping wolf, and it's form began to change.
380 When it bent down to touch the wolf, it had taken on the form of a man in his
381 late twenties, and man who had once been a regular at the Inn.  He looked
382 much the same, except that the color of his whole body, and all his posessions
383 where shades of grey and black.  He looked at the tired wolf and managed a 
384 feeble " Tally Ho(e) ".

386   One more point for Frank.  If there is nothing wrong with your behavior,
387 why ask us what we think?

402       Well, everyone, last night was my trip to see 'The Last Starfighter'.
403 you know, the new movie with all the computer simulated space machines.  Well,
404 I'll just say it was FANTASTIC.  The first space shot brought tears to my
405 eyes.  Go see it as soon as it's on the general showings!  I'm even
406 conseidering turning my bolo in for a Gunstar.  
407     L'homme: Hmmm, nothing really out of the ordinary happened to me at
408 westercon.  I saw what was inside the Tardis, that was interesting.  It was
409 my first con, so I really don't have anything to compare it too.  However, two
410 of my friends and I are at this time making plans for Worldcon coming at
411 the end of the summer.

418 Frank,
419         My first reaction to your entry was nothing less than INTENSE....
420 You hypocritically face society under the facade of normalcy, all the 
421 while hiding the perverse nature of your sexuality from those whose children
422 you contact. How can you, as a responsible adult (?), claim ignorance of 
423 natural tenets as the pertain to sexual development ???...At best it
424 is a confusing blend of emotion and physical development that marks the 
425 passage of adolescence ...at worst sheer HELL...and you have the 
426 unmitigated contempt to foist your unbridled attentions on these children
427 who as yet have not discovered their OWN sexual identity....You willfully
428 and malevolently alter their growth....All under the infantile guise and
429 refrain of " If it feels good do it "
430         That is the worst rationalization of any perversion I have ever heard.
431 How do you feel about your children comming in contact with pedophiles ( other
432 than yourself....or have you beaten them to it ? )
433 How about your wife ?
434         My personal abhorrance aside -  Seek professional help. For it is a
435 crime both legally and morally to ask of child what is not yet his to give.

439 P.S.   Yes The Last starfighter was good ...saw it last friday

441 Hey, something just occured to me....
442 Mig is a teenager, good at videogames & does maintainance at a trailer park.
443 Does this sound familar? 
444 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
445 Jay noticed the new game as he was heading home. "Starfighter? Not very
446 original, but these graphics!"
447 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
448 Sorry MIG, I couldn't resist!
449 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
450 In view of certain "traditions" in the spy thriller field...
451 Oh, Oh-Oh-Seven! (words & music: John Brunner)(yes, THE John Brunner!)
452 There's a dark grey Bentley drophead and it's piled against a wall,
453 And a curl of smoke is rising overhead,
454 For the bomb was in the dashboard -- but the man's not hurt at all
455 Though the pretty girl beside him is stone dead!
456 Oh Oh-Oh-Seven! Oh Oh-Oh-Seven!
457 Will you kindly stop dispatching girls to heaven?
458 There's crowds outside the Pearly Gate --
459 So get this message through your pate:
460 Just keep those girls alive!
461 
462 There's a vodka dry martini and it stands on Harry's Bar
463 And it's flavored with a dash of cyanide.
464 Now the man who asked and paid for it has left for Zanzibar
465 But his sultry half-caste girl friend has just died!
466 Oh Oh-Oh-Seven! Oh Oh-Oh-Seven!
467 Will you kindly stop dispatching girls to heaven?
468 There's crowds outside the Pearly Gate --
469 The angel choirs they try to date --
470 So get this message through your pate:
471 Just keep those girls alive!
472 
473 There's a two-five-seven Mannlicher with telescopic sights
474 And a bullet with his name is up for test,
475 But it's very hard to hold him still thses warm romantic nights,
476 So the villain's faithless mistress has gone west!
477 Oh Oh-Oh-Seven! Oh Oh-Oh-Seven!
478 Will you kindly stop dispatching girls to heaven?
479 There's crowds outside the Pearly Gate --
480 The angel choirs they try to date --
481 We simply cannot concentrate!
482 So get this message thru your pate:
483 Just keep those girls alive!
484 
485 There's a mamba and a cobra and a rattler and a krait
486 And they've all been hidden in a hotel bed,
487 But the girl he met this evening said she simply couldn't wait,
488 So he's still alive and she's been killed instead!
489 Oh Oh-Oh-Seven! Oh Oh-Oh-Seven!
490 Will you kindly stop dispatching girls to heaven?
491 There's crowds outside the Pearly Gate --
492 The angel choirs they try to date --
493 We simply cannot concentrate!
494 The situation's desperate!
495 So get this message through your pate:
496 Just keep those girls alive!
497 
498 There's an urgent memorandum and it's gone up to the Boss,
499 And it's come back marked for action right away,
500 For the Earth is short of beauty and can't stand this constant loss,
501 So there's got to be an end to Jimmy's play!
502 Oh Oh-Oh-Seven! Oh Oh-Oh-Seven!
503 Will you kindly stop dispatching girls to heaven?
504 There's crowds outside the Pearly Gate --
505 The angel choirs they try to date --
506 We simply cannot concentrate!
507 The situation's desperate!
508 You've had your chance and sealed your fate --
509 JUST KEEP THOSE GIRLS ALIVE!
510 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
511 The only defense I can offer is that while "copying" the spy thriller
512 format they copied the bad "traditions" with the good. 
513 Note that *I* do not attempt to "justify" anyone's actions. I see no
514 reason why such is necessary. Apoligies are sometimes necessary, but I fail to
515 see why someone feels a need to justify their actions!
516 Now that THAT is out of the way, I am in need of a drink!
517 Innkeeper! A flagon of stout, if you please! And refills for my friends!

521 Anyone:  I am getting a printer this weekend for my C-64.  Does anyone know if it can be used with the 1600 modem?
522 That is, without re-writing the modem program, .  Any useful help would be appreciated.
523 P.A.L.'s:  I was going to call last night, but I couldn't get through.
524 Teddy S:  Grow up!!!!  Your attitude towards MiG and the Ninja is stupid.  They warned you before they did anything 
525 before hand.  They gave you a chance.  Stop pestering them (and us) with your feeble threats.  I mean, my fellow police
526 friends would like to know  where you live, so they won't watch it...
527 Milchar:  I know, I know...Don't bug me about it...
528 PorSFiS People:  I definitly WON'T be attending the meeting Sat.  Last night I wasn't too sure, but now it's for
529 sure.  I trust that you won't be too disappointed. (If you are in the first place.)
530 See ya' all later..........

534 Thanks a lot!!!

537 YOU GUYS DONT REALLIE TAIK THIS GUY FRANK SEROUS DO YOU?
538 I'M NEW AND DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THIS, BUT I HAD TO RESPOND TO FRANK.  I  
539 AGREE WITH ALEX (I THINK IT WAS) WHO RAISED THE QUESTION OF THE BOYS'
540 FEELINGS.  I ALSO COULDN'T HELP BUT WONDER WHY HE WOULD HAVE RAISED SUCH
541 AN ISSUE IF IT WAS NOT BOTHERING HIM.  I TRUST THAT GOOD JUDGEMENT WILL
542 PREVAIL AND THAT HE WILL SEEK SOME HELP.  THERE IS HOPE FOR ALL WHO WILL
543 LOOK FOR IT.  
544 
545 P.S.  I love all the borders between messages.  As I said, I'm new at
546 this and would like to know more.  Bye for now.

550 What?  Still no description of the Dragon Room?  Must I bring it upon myself?  Oh, well , at least I can do...
551 ++++++++++++++
552 Milchar stepped into the kitchen of the Dragon Room.  It seemed well-kept for this part of town, and that seemed odd.
553 A cook was busily stirring vegetables in a shallow pan, his back to the mage.  Just as well, as he would have had a
554 coronary.  Milchar looked about himself, saw his attire was unfit for the occasion, and willed for better clothes...
555 (Now switching to first person, it's about time I did...)
556 I look down and see that I am dressed in a trenchcoat, and wearing a dark hat that just barely shaded my face.  
557 Feeling much better, I slipped by the cook and entered the main Dining Hall...
