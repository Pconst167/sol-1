 65      The glimmer of lights from the revelry in the city below him disturbed 
 66 Leichter to no end.  Angrily, he slammed closed the large glass window and shut
 67 the blinds, turning his back on the cries of joy and happiness that tormented  
 68 his soul, if not his ears.
 69      Storming through his plush penthouse apartment, Leichter quickly reached 
 70 the living room and sank down into a disheveled heap in an oversized chair.  
 71 The charred fingers of his left hand    tapped out an idiosyncratic rhythm on a
 72 table of imitation oak.  
 73      Reaching out to the small night    stand to his right, he grasped the 
 74 papers that he had been studying earier,  as if he had not memorized them
 75 already...  Anything to destroy the wall of despair that was already beginning
 76 to creep into his consciosness...
 77      The phone rang, like a demonic     bell, from its place on the nightstand.
 78 Without allowing it to complete its first ring, Leichter picked up the 
 79 reciever.  "Hello." he muttered.
 80      "Leichteer?"
 81      "Oh," he replied, grimacing.  "Dawson.  You didn't have to call... I've
 82 talked to Sandis about things.  He's filled me in."  His mind wasn't 
 83 concentrating on the wordds, lost as he   was in his melanchooly mist.
 84      "Yes, he told me.  But there're    some other things I'd like to clear
 85 up if I can help it."
 86      "Shoot."  
 87      "Specifically, the logistics of    what you're to be accomplishing.  We
 88 can't have you gallavanting about like  a deranged policeman.  The NET 
 89 business isn't your affair.  You needed to be aware, and if they come running  
 90 after we've reached our goal they'll    have to be dealt with.  But until then 
 91 I don't want to see any personal        vendettas getting in te way..."
 92      "Spare me the detective show monologue.  It's a cliche'."
 93      "And you're addicted to them. and  you know it.  Don't lie to me, and 
 94 don't lie to yourself."
 95      "If this was the only reason you-"
 96      "Listen!" the voice on the other end of the line was rapidly becoming
 97 agitated.  "ZEPHYR can stand on its own without you on this NET problem, if
 98 that's what's necessary.  We'd like you to be in on things, but I'm starting
 99 to think that it might be better if we  sent you off smewhere else-"
100      Leichter considered it for a few   moments.  "Like?"
101      "Nothing in particular.  Routine   assassination of some rival drug 
102 peddlers.  Our concentration in Miami   was thinned out a little by the 
103 Vice Squad bust...  and some of the natives there have been sowing their wild  
104 oats and reaping the benefits.  A buncha KIDS, for chrissake.  Not one of them 
105 older than 21.  What say you go down there and show 'em your piano wire 
106 collection?"
107      "Tempting..."  He considered his   options.  Unbidden, his left hand rose
108 to his face, and he stared at the black scars that twisted along the palm, 
109 the husks of flesh that clung to the    fingers.  "No, no, I'm fine.  I can    
110 handle things.  I'll be ok, and I won't get involved with NET..."
111      "THAT'S the boy I wanted to hear.  Go get 'em, tiger"  Liechter cursed
112 Dawson mentally.  Althe little creep  needed to do was lisp and his character
113 would be complete.
114      "Yeah, right." he dropped the phone onto the stand, where it clattered
115 hollowly.  Getting up, Leichter strode  into his bedroom, and removed a 
116 small box from a drawer.  Opening it,   he spread the papers it contained over 
117 the desk, retrieving one.....  a        photograph.  He eyed it for a few      
118 seconds, and pulled a red marker from   his pocket.  With a quivering hand he  
119 scrawled a single word across the face  of the picture.

174      The sickly sweet stench of candy sugur assailed his nose o
175 as he stuck his head out the window to see if anyone was left in the theater.
176 "Damn," he thought, why is there always two or three people left who wait to 
177 watch the credits!" Down in the front rows was a group of three people intently
178 wtching the credits. Shaking his head John Richardson, projectionist, walked on
179 down to the next cinema to see if he could turn that one off. 
180     Damn!" he said aloud seeing yet another group of people waiting. He walked 
181 back to the desk to file his reports for the night. Finishing them up he looked
182 out to the lobby to see how box office was doing. Suddenly a group of people 
183 came out from the theaters into the lobby. "Good, now I can shut the projectors
184 off...." his words trailed off as he noticed that they had masks over their hea
185 ds with hand guns trained at the box person.
186      Knowing there was no phone in the projection booth, John started to head 
187 out the back way when he realized they must have someone there. Looking out the
188 side air vent confirmed his fears. Suddenly he realized they were probably 
189 sending someone upto deal with HIM any second now. 
190      Running with the fear of death in his mind, John ran to the ladder leading
191 to the roof. As he got to the top he heard footsteps on the stairs. John quick-
192 ly pulled himself onto the roof and left the hatch open. "If they don't hear it
193 they may not notice it," he hoped silently. Scanning the roof he felt a tidal 
194 wave of depression hit him. Nothing to hide behind except the airconditioning 
195 units, six foot by six foot units ony five feet high. TREES! There were tree
196 at the back of the theater, could he climb down one. Running over to the CINEMA
197 sign he looked down, an eight foot drop to the pines that probably wouldn't 
198 hold his weight if climbed UP it, much less drop to it.
199      The head popped up behind a cannon of a gun. Covered in solid black except
200 for the eyes and mouth he was nearly invisible. He slowly covered the ground 
201 near the HVAC units at a good distance and found no-one around them. He began a
202 check around the edge of the cinema to see if any one had jumped. A good fifty
203 to sixty foot drop, anyone jumping should have broken a leg. As he came to the 
204 back he saw foot prints in the metal around the edge, he peered over to see if 
205 someone had tried for the trees. Seeing nothing he turned around in time for a
206 large shoe to connect with his face, the las image before he blacked out.
207  
208      Steve was upset. Everything had gone according to plan except for the 
209 projectionist. They had the theater covered and should be out of there in five
210 minutes. But if the projectionist had somehow gotten away and to a phone they 
211 could be on the way to jail in five minutes. 
212      A clanging of metal sent him whirling around to see Mike coming down the 
213 ladder. "Did you find him?" Steve asked. Mike nodded his head and moved his 
214 hand in an pointing arc. "Knocked him over the edge?"
215     Mike grunted a little and shrugged his shoulders. 
216      "Well hell," Steve said, "Let's get outta here."
217      Mike followed silently.
218  
219      Downstairs things were finishing up, they had the money and were ready to
220 leave. The six people had just started to leave, but one hang back a second.
221      "Don't move or I'll kill you!" 
222      The five men stopped, one turned with a gun in hand and was shot in the 
223 shoulder. The other four slowly put their hands on their heads.
224      John pulled off the mask and grinned a devil's grin. Within a few minutes 
225 the police were on the scene and took the robbers away. "Not bad," he thought,
226 "I wonder if I'll get a bonus?"
227  
228 Okay, I'm tired and I just got off work and improved this on the spot. So tell 
229 me, am I beyond hope?

238 	I liked it Talos.  The scene with the projectionist shooting the 
239 villian in the shoulder was somewhat unexpected, and I'm a bin unclear as to 
240 how the hero got the jump on the bad guy on the roof.  But considering the
241 fact that you improvised I'd say you did very well.  
242  
243 	My next entry will be somewhat delayed, as I'm haveing to do a bit

279 Tim, somebody might have answered this in mail already, but just in case...
280 You'll need to specify what sort of computer you're using first, as not all

301 that puts him out of work for quite some time. I broke up with my girlfriend 
302 a few days ago. The band I had tried to get into fell apart. On top of all 
303 that, I had just started to save money for college. Now it's gonna be useful

343 Y'know, I hate to be picky (not true, I love it), but I have to point out that 
344 it's not REALLY the beginning of a new decade; that does happen until next year
345 The simple way of observing this is to note that the first year is year "1", an
346 d that in order for the first decade to have ten years, it must end on year ten
347 Therefore, 1990 is the LAST year of the '80s, not the first of the '90s.
348   My guess is that people will also forget that 2000 is NOT the beginning of th
349 e21st century.  *Sigh*
350      By the way, the year 2000 is a leap year, although 1900 was not...

354 But Starpath, you are incorrect too!  1990 is the first year of the nineties.
355 That appelation is reference only to what the years final two digits are, not 
356 to which decade the year is in.  You are correct in saying that the decade is
357 part of the ninth decade of this century, though.  And I suspect you are right
358 that the "hypsters" will start the new century and millenium early.  Sigh.

406      Leichter dropped heavily into the  plush chair, reaching out to sip from
407 the steaming cup of orange tea that     rested on the side table.  Placing the 
408 cup back on the table, he proceeded to  examine the small spiral notebook that 
409 he had carried with him from the other  room, frowning as he opened to the     
410 first page and a few stray newspaper    clippings scattered onto the floor, and
411 onto the small dog at his feet.  The    border collie looked up at him with    
412 pathetically loyal eyes.  "Sorry, Kato, boy..." he soothed, patting the animal 
413 reassuringly.  Leichter had never been  one too be fond of animals, but Kato   
414 was an exception.  He'd found the poor  thing during an incredible rainstorm,  
415 the sad creature being hidden behind a  pile of rotting boxes.  Naturally, not 
416 even one such as Leichter could endure  the guilt that would have surely 
417 weighed upon his conscience had he not  taken the vagabond beast in, nursing   
418 it back to health after both the        injuries of life on the road andd the  
419 debilitation of a temporary illness that had afflicted the pup.  Sighing in    
420 contentment, Kato dropped his head to   the ground once more as Leichter       
421 gathered the assorted clippings, taking note of each...
422  
423      HIDDEN SNIPER KILLS WARDEN...  WIFE AND YOUTH DIE IN BIZARRE MURDER...
424 SUSPECTED CRACKHOUSE BOMBED...  TEEN GANG VICTIMS OF DRUG WAR...  
425      Each one had a story, but the       words of black and white did not blot
426 out the words of red that assailed his  mind as Leichter's reddened eyes
427 scanned the faded pages.  "Forget it."  He mused, absently stuffing the book   
428 and its contents into a drawer on the   table.  
429      He sat there, for a few moments,   allowing the red to fade, the field of
430 vision to return to California, 1990,   the world to return to the point where 
431 it only TEETERED on the brink of sheer  insanity.  His hands cased their       
432 quiverings, and with that he picked up  the telephone and jabbed at the buttons
433 rapidly.  
434      "Hello?" the voice at the other    end answered eventually.
435      "This is Adric." he replied.
436      "Leichter?" the voice sounded more than a bit surprised.  "What are YOU
437 calling about?  It's 1:53 AM!"  The     shaky voice on the other end faded 
438 between sleep and awareness with 
439 surprising regularity.
440      "I'm ontto something big.  I've     already contacted Dietrich and the 
441 Associates thrgh my channels.  But    I do require some information on a few  
442 fuzzy matters that I'd like to clear    up."
443      "Specifically?"
444      "I need you to get what you can    on the NET's activities right now, and
445 that INCLUDES any independent-"
446      "NET?  Who sent YOU on something   that involved NET?"
447      "Relax.  It's controlled.  And I'm the only one available to pull it.  We
448 can come out of tthis with some goods    that'll put ZEPHYR back on the top of 
449 the heap where we belong."
450      "I'll check on it..." the voice    sighed in resignation.  "It's hot?"
451      "Steaming."
452      "So's the pressure on the NET files right now.  I'm not sure what's going
453 down with them."
454      "It's not your place to worry about it, is it?"
455      "I'm just giving you fair warning  that when I pull this there may be some
456 serious strikes against you in the      surprise column."
457      "Take the risk."
458      "You're the boss!" the line clicked and Leichter was greeted with the
459 roar of the dial tone.
460      "I know." he replied to no one in   particular.
461  
462      
463 * * *
464  
465      The man in the grey suit adressed  those sassembled before him.  "As the
466 Associates for the Eyrlin Proposition,  your attention to the facts in this
467 operation must be precise and acute.    There may be no room for rror.  Need 
468 I remind you of the unfortunate but     necessary circumstances surrounding the
469 tragic loss of Mr. Holland a few short  months ago?"
470      Six blank faces stared back at him rigidly.
471      "I thought so.  ZEPHYR is not one  to tolerate a lack of attention to
472 detail."  He eyed the first man cooly.  "I trust you gathered your infomation
473 as you were instructed?"
474      The first man at the table rose    nervously, scratching at the back of
475 his neck.  "Er, yes.  It would seem     that we've isolated the rival gang
476 groups to two main areas, Provida and    Endel Parks, to be exact."
477      "Gentlemen, as you are no doubt    aware, these gangs are becoming a 
478 serious, albiet harmless, consideration in our attempts at operations.  Now,"
479 he smiled grimly. "Admittedly, there    have been a -few- cases of sniper      
480 hits, stealing, from these groups, and  THAT is why we're taking action."
481      The thirdd man looked at the speaker through his reflective sunglases.
482 "We can take 'em in an hour, if you'd   like, Sir."
483      The speaker considered it.  "No,   prolong it a little.  Make it..." he
484 paused.  "... interesting.  Be a bit    CREATIVE for once, for crissake.  You
485 have tools.  USE them just this once    and make a killing like Daddy used to
486 do it.  I want them dead, but add some human suffering." Again he  paused.  "Oh
487 yes, and about their families..."
488      The six noticeably shuddered.
489      "Can't have any younger siblings   coming into the fold."  That his 
490 logic failed here made no difference to him.  "They buy it, too.  AND their    
491 parents.  In fact, while you're out     there, why not incite some good old    
492 fashioned rioting and arson!!"  The old man's eyes gleamed.  "Now get out there
493 and DO this ONE for ME!"
494  
495      The assembled cheered, stamping out of the room in unison, all donning
496 their glasses and black overcoats.      "So hard to find good help these days."
497 the old man muttered, and proceeded to  rearrange his cluttered desk.

596 To Tim M.: In the constructive department, you might try taking an english
597            class.  In your last note you spelled....
598  
599 PREFERRENCE, when it should be --preference--. Also,
600 STAITMENT is spelled --statement--.
601  
602            This in conjunction with very poor sentence structure propels
603            me to make the following assertion.
604  
605            I know that when a child is in school that the math classes might
606            seem quite fascinating, in conjunction with an over stressed
607            emphasis on their importance.  However in our modern industrial
608            world, reasonable grammar skills can provide an adolescent with a
609            far further grasp of the skills needed to procure the employment
610            of their reverie.  Therefore Tim, I would like to persuade you to
611            take any of the english classes that you have an opportunity to
612            secure.  YES, even in the place of higher math!  I believe that
613            you will find that the result, in the long run, will be well worth
614            it.

668                                 
669         Scarlet, Wadsworth and I entered the dimly-lit room.  Slowly, our
670 eyes adjusted, and we took stock of our situation.
671         Scarlet glanced here and there, frantically tapping on his little
672 keyboard, apparently unwilling to render a judgement until all the facts
673 were processed.  The stuffy Wadsworth stared, wide-eyed, at the scene --
674 a look of horror blended with exhilaration frozen on his chubby face.
675         As for myself:  a primitive physiological reaction was all it took
676 to inform me that we had entered a brothel.  We were in a large, luxurious
677 room liberally furnished with couches and cushions.  A few men sat in the
678 center, probably waiting for specific hostesses.  Around the sides lounged
679 seductive women, who, upon observing our entrance, inevitably began
680 winking and evaluating us amongst themselves.
681         One woman in particular -- a tall, dark lady wearing a low-cut red
682 gown -- caught my eye.  Oddly, the little wave and nose-crinkle she
683 directed my way suggested prior acquaintance.  In fact, now that I noticed
684 it, several of the females were starting to look disturbingly familiar!
685 I lowered my head to avoid being further recognized.
686         "I think we're in the wrong place!"  Wadsworth's nervous little
687 voice announced, an internal conflict playing itself openly on his face.
688 The poor man's scandalized expression was broken only by his eyes, which
689 darted wildly, absorbing all the enticing images they could before his
690 guilt-laden conscience dammed desire's forbidden flood.
691         "What about it, Scarlet?" I asked.  "Are we at the right place?"
692         But the thin man didn't seem to hear me.  He continued tapping on
693 his keyboard, mumbling to himself, "...preponderance of females...
694 ...approximate percentage of body covered...cross-reference, specific
695 physical features exposed...mm-hmm...cosmetic index...correlate, standard
696 lingerie index..."
697        Within a few minutes, he looked up, startled.  "Albright!  We're
698 in a brothel!"  And as he peered around again, I got the feeling he was
699 seeing the place for the first time.
700         "Are you sure?" I asked.
701         "Hypothesis not rejected at ninety-five percent confidence..."
702         "OK, Scarlet."
703         "...confirmed by the Heffner Variation T & A test..."
704         "Scarlet!"  I interrupted, vaguely annoyed that he had missed my
705 earlier sarcasm.  "What are we supposed to be doing here?"
706         "Information coming through."  Scarlet whispered.  "It was blocked
707 until our confirmed arrival at this location."
708         He watched for several minutes as information blurred past his
709 sreen, during which time I stalled the madame with a detailed discussion
710 of activities and fees.  Finally, Scarlet pulled me aside.  "I can't go
711 into the details, but it would seem we are to establish covers here."
712         I practically laughed.  What sort of cover could our unlikely trio
713 hope to establish in a brothel?
714         "It would seem that I am to play the part of a chemist."  Scarlet
715 continued, "hmm. That is a noble profession!  Wadsworth is my apprentice."
716 H scanned the screen for a few moments, and frowned.  "This is strange.
717 All of my specialties seem to involve creating or imitating illegal mind-
718 altering substances.  There must be some mistake."
719         I spent the next few minutes describing to Scarlet the type of
720 organization he was supposed to infiltrate.  With a look of distaste, he
721 resolved to carry out his mission.
722         Then he started reciting my orders.  But just as he began doing
723 so, my eyes met those of the dark woman I'd seen earlier.  She was moving
724 toward me with cat-like fluidity.  Her dress was slit nearly up to her hip
725 on one side, presenting me at each step with a wonderful view of her
726 entire shapely leg.  And that leg was getting steadily nearer, along with
727 the rest of the woman!
728        And then she was before me; her eyes, an intense silver-gray, were
729 staring passionately into my own.  I felt like I was going to say some-
730 thing, but she touched a finger to my lips, and then moved it slowly down,
731 to my chin, throat, and chest, and further down, where she let it hang
732 with uncomfortable tension on my belt buckle.
733         She pulled herself closer, so I could just feel her body brushing
734 against mine -- so close I could smell her lilac-scented hair.  "Simon
735 Albright," she whispered, "you must come and see me before you leave.
736 Like old times."  And, like a breeze, she was gone.
737                                 
738         "Albright...Albright!"  The new voice was Scarlet's.
739         "Huh?" I said, suddenly aware that Scarlet had been reading to me
740 the whole time.
741         "I was just saying that it's imperative you don't blow your
742 cover."  Then he studied me a moment.  "You WERE listening, weren't you?"
743         "Of course."  I stated, adding a touch of indignation.  I couldn't
744 very well admit that I'd ignored his instructions while flirting with a
745 girl who had penetrated my cover even before I had one.  I guessed I'd
746 have to play it by ear.  Whatever my identity was supposed to be, it was
747 worthless at this location, anyway.
748         "Why are we doing this, Scarlet?"  I asked, changing the subject.
749         "No time to explain!"  He whispered quickly, pointing to the
750 approaching madame.  "It has to do with a rival organization called
751 ZEPHYR.  I've dealt with them before.  Their leader is quite rabbit!"
752         "He's what?"
753         "I said, he's quite rabid!"
754         "Oh."

760      Leichter's musings were once more  cut short by the resounding scream of
761 the telephone beside him.  His bleary   eyes darted to a large grandfather 
762 clock, which read -6:08 AM-.  Insomnia  claims another victim, he thought.     
763      "Yes?" he growled into the reciever.
764      "Leichter!  Glad you're home.      Listen, something is coming down."
765      "Details." he replied, his system  snapping into attention like a caffeine
766 demon.
767      "It would appear that one of our   small-time operations has been... shall
768 we say... infiltrated."  An audible     smirk crackled across the line.
769      "Specifics."
770      "It would appear, sir, that some   covert operatives have managed to
771 break into one of our brothels."  A     momentary pause.  "The Fiends!  Our
772 Entire Operation May Be Placed In       Jeopardy!!!!"  The voice of the man on 
773 the other end of the line dripped with  camp.
774      Leichter was puzzled.  "How were   we able to locate them?  It's not as if
775 we're alerting groups like THAT to the  identities of enemy agents or covert   
776 groups."
777      "Oh, you'll love it."
778      "Get to the point, Meyers, or I'll be filing some papers with the Old Man
779 before you know it."
780      "Apparently," a pause... "One of   the agents has partaken of the house
781 specialty once before..."
782      "Oh please."
783      "No, truth be told."
784      "All right.  Sure it isn't a set   up?"
785      "What would they really have to    gain in trying to draw us out into
786 the open?  They already know that we    exist.  No, I'd say it was for reall.
787 There's been a lot of computer activity for some time... seems they were trying
788 to establish cover for a bunch oof them.  I wouldn't be surprised if they still
789 thought that they weren't all detected  by now."
790      "Nevertheless, we can't take any   chances.  Do we have any specifics on
791 House reaction?"
792      "They're giving you the red lantern... er, green light."
793      "Fine..."  he thought for a moment.  "How much does the place take in?"
794      "Not enough to say so."
795      "Hit it.  Wipe it out.  We'll do   a public service and we can clean up
796 and rebuild with better stock.  The     facility can be transferred to the
797 narcotics groups.  They'll make more    that way, anyhow.  Nobody uses those
798 things anymore...  It's the '90's, my   friend.  Safe Sex."
799      "What about 'Say No To Drugs'?"
800      "People aren't THAT stupid."
801      "How many should we send over?"
802      "For a Fire Sale?  I'd say about   six.  I want them to get in, nail the
803 place, and get out.  No explanations,   no infiltration.  Just send them right 
804 through the door."
805      "Got it."
806      "Oh, and Meyer?"
807      "Yessir?"
808      "Give me some REAL types.  No      silly code names."
809      "Got it!  Over and out."
810      "And don't forget to use the card  this time."
811      Your personal contribution to     Deux Film Noir?  Why bother?"
812      "The police'll investigate.  I     want them to know."
813      "What good'll that do?"
814      "It will make things... a little   more interesting."
815

819      A long black limousine came to a   silent halt outside the rather shoddy
820 establishment.  Six men, each dressed   in pinstripes and sunglasses, stepped
821 out, their doors slamming in unison.    Walking towards the door, their highly 
822 polished black boots clickedin steady, regular rhythm against the cracked  
823 concrete.  "This is the place."  said   the first, eyeing the name emblazoned  
824 across the door.  "Femme De Lapine...   Cute."
825      The six each opened the violin     cases that they were carrying, and
826 each extracted an odd weapon that       seemed to closely resemble a tommygun, 
827 more likely than not because of the     fact that that was what they were.
828      "Real quick.  Real easy."  muttered the first, under his reath.
829      "Like candy from a baby."  whispered the second.
830      "Like shooting fish in a barrel."
831      "Easy boys." calmed the third.     "Let's save it for inside."
832  
833 * * *
834  
835  
836      Far away at that exact same moment, a fragile hand pressed down on an
837 intercom.  "Yessir?" the voice on the   other end queried.
838      "The Two have entered into the     picture.  It's starting."
839      "Sure thing, boss."
840      "Get the ball rolling.  I want     word out to all the various groups,
841 yesterday.  Things are going to start   snowballing, especially after 
842 Leichter takes action against the men   in the brothel.  I want us prepared
843 for retaliatory strikes."
844      "I'll keep my ears up."
845      "Time's a wasting..."  The frail   old voice faded into static.

914 A funny piece, but let us no rant to much at all those starry eyed ten
915 year olds out there.  Some of them might even learn something about 
916 computers,  and we're not going to be on even ground at that point.  They
917 didn't have readilly available personal computers till I  was in my mid
918 teens, and I didn't get to buy my own computer untill I was 19.  
919  
920 Yes, think about it.  People who have been programing from the age of 6 or so.
921 I see the same sort of effect in the newer video games.  When I was a kid
922 pong and tank battle were hot stuff, and now when I try to play the latest
923 hot shoot'em up I get blown away in five seconds flat.  While I watch
924 5 and six year olds rack up scores in excess of 1000 times my own.
925  
926 I was a member of the first generation to have the oppurtunity to have
927 and use their own personal computer. (If you had the rather large chunk
928 of free change needed.)  And the present generation is being exposed in
929 a much larger way.  We're all going to change because of it.

936    I love the reference to the "harvard.edu" address - just who is this
937 guy/gal/thing?  Identify yourself and create an Identity.  If you're
938 a clone, don't worry about the individuality bit, just give yourself
939 a collective term (preferably species-oriented) - we (usually) don't
940 discriminate (or do I speak for the minority?), and fiction is more
941 than welcome (ok, folks, so we EXPECT fiction to simply roll off of
942 fingertips like your foot in a soapy teflon tub), so make a bother
943 and express yourself (no exclamations (sp) needed - oh, drat, my
944 Spelle caught that.  What tha (sp) hell else will it catch?)
945 to everyone, and do your best.  If you can't, you could always
946 do your worst.  Come to think of it, most of us are doing our worst.
947  
948    AD,  it's been so long.  What's happened since I was out?  Has
949 the Inn returned?  Has time stopped?  Have I missed anything important?
950 Does a Rolex(tm) tell time? - sure do.  (Shut up and get back inside,
951 I told you not to come out until we are alone.)  Aw, but I was
952 having so much fun (I DON'T CARE, get your psychosis back in here!)
953 Awrite, I do dat.  (Now, stay put.  I need to continue work on the
954 portible laser pistol system.  There seems to be a problem with
955 the nitrogen cooling jacket around the flashtube...)
956  
957    ...and so Hagbard wanders off, unable to regain his balance as
958 a singluar being, struggling to make the laser pistol that he saw
959 on the Buck Rogers(tm) T.V. series.  Tune in next time for a dreadful
960 rendition (sp) ( <EXPLICATIVE DELETED> ) of

977      H'lo to all you people and other things out there in la-la land!  I'm
978 back!  Well, actually I'm not back, I still Kurfur, but that's not
979 important.  Let's just say that I have returned.

981      It's amazing how this disk has been open for the last month.  Since 
982 Dec-27 I believe.  Whaz goin on 'ere?  I leave for a bit of bladecraft
983 and everyone goes boring.  What this board needs (Odin protect me from my 
984 words!) is a couple of immature twits to de-complacensize the populous.
985 Remember how lively the messages would become when there General ZOD
986 lurking about and making himself a wonderful Twit-Bashing Target?
987  
988      So, what's with all the new borders.  Who all 'round here is new 
989 since I last logged on?  Glad to see Hagbard and A.D. are still here, as
990 well as Talos Valheru and a few others that I can't remember (I've been
991 making up for sleep with caffiene lately, ok?).  There are a few that are
992 notably absent, but that may be because I've not been paying enough
993 attention.  Also, what in the name of Midgard happened to Applephilia?!!??
994  
995     On a diffrn't note, anyone here play Shadowrun?  I found the book new
996 for only $8.00 ($28 regular price), and had to buy it (gloat gloat :).
