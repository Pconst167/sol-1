36     Why, Fred, I'm glad you asked that question.  There are quite a few
37 systems in town, and I'm sure you will like them.
38     There is Alternate World for example (777-xxxx) which is now an AE line,
39 or you can call the Bit Bucket where a current list of all the boards is kept.
40     The Bit Bucket requires your real name, and a little time in order to
41 have full access.  But after you get it, there will be a lot of ther boards
42 for you to call.

43     The phone number is 254-xxxx.

51     It was a darkened time upon the once bountiful land. The land that once
52 held such promise now resembled barren dessert devoid of life. Those who
53 had inhabited the land were swept away in the torrent of destruction. Only
54 Trainor to tell the story, and in so telling, the story may never be
55 forgotten. It was up  rainor to cross the known realities with his pell-
56 mell device, searching for anyone who would listen to his story, and heed
57 his warning.

61     "A danger so great as |o rip the very fabric of time asundar exists now,
62 and soon it will return to anotxer reality to rend is destruction. My homeland
63 is now nothing more than ruins. I weep for xhose I have lost, but weeping

65 diabolical wings. I search out for adventurers, perhaps like yourselves, to

67 diabolical wings. I search out for adventurers, perhaps like yourselves, to
68 help me hunt this evil down and destroy it. So far my search has been futile,
69 for all turn their backs when they hear my tale of woe. Will you turn your
70 backs?"
71      So went Trainor to the patrons of the Backwater Inn at Inisfal. No face
72 betrayed fear, unlike so many other inns and cantinas across Trainor's travels.
73      A single clear voice broke the silence. Its tone was cautious, but a bit
74 of eagerness could be detected. "You are looking for help then? Help against
75 this 'danger' as you call it. You have remained vague about this 'danger.'
76 I speak for everyone when I say that none of us is foolish enough to go
77 along with you until we know more about this 'danger.' But some of us, in
78 fact many of us may be foolish to accompany you after you tell us more about
79 the quest and the 'danger' you seek."
80      Nods and murmurs of approval swept over the assemblage. The other 
81 patrons were obviously interested, and wanted to hear more about what
82 Trainor's plea.
83      "I would be more than happy to relate to you all I know. Already you
84 have shown more interest than the previous score of so-called hardy adventure-
85 types I have encountered in my travels. The time grows near for action, ask
86 me any questions you like. Details may be sketchy, but I will do my best."
87      Trainor's voice revealed his excitement at the prospect of help in
88 his quest. He knew he could not continue alone. He had already wasted
89 too much time casting his story on innumerable the oaken table tops the
90 pell-mell had to offer. He would not pass up this chance, even in the
91 light of extensive questioning. Trainor could see in the eyes of all
92 txose around him the gaze of hardened and experienced questors. These
93 men and women were not new to the ways of high adventure and extreme
94 danger. Perhaps among them there would be enough willing souls to go
95 with Trainor, and if successful, save the Galactic Reality!
96      "Please step forward! Ask me what you will. Oh you brave and wonderful
97 people, you have given me new hope..."

101         Yes fellow patrons, are you up for an adventure? Are you willing to
102 sacrifice the time needed to read and write and partake of a story, a quest
103 of goodness and honor? Are you reading to face unknown challenges? Are you
104 prepared for the rigors of writer's block? Please let me know, or better still,
105 begin writing. I am asking for a multi-authored round-robin story of old, will
106 I get one?

115    From back in the corners where he had been sitting for quite some time now,
116  Fencer raised his awareness to this newcomer's plea.  He had hung his head in
  ** DISK ERR IN LINE 117 **
117 
118  the prospect of redeeming himself- ah, wasn't that always the way of a drunkard though- at this new chance for 
119  adventure perked his brain from its current state of vegetation.  "Trainor."
120  , he shouted slurrenly, "tell us more about this Galactic business. I'd like
121  to know a littl' more before I, before I go off tramping off tramping into
122  nothing that I know."  Fencer raised his drunken head to the window- caught
123  a glance of the once-pround, now dullard face, and shouted to the barmaid-
124  "Missy- Send another mug of al...black coffee this way, would'y dear?"
125 (*{(*{}*)}*)  Oh boy- a comeback!

146     "Sir Trainor!" called a figure in the back, known to some simply as
147 Emu.  I've not been on an adventure for more that a year now.  The life
148 of a farmer is getting me down.  I want to get back into the spirit, and
149 the Inn has been a great place to be on the edge.  However, I'm tired of
150 lurking in the corner, and would like to sharpen my skills as a hunter and
151 tracker.  Before I make any foolhardy commitments, though, can you tell
152 us all what you seek?"
153     Others joined in agreement to the question.  A dwarf by the fireside
154 called out, "More importantly, why do you seek it?"  All were hoping for
155 a new story to be told, this one about one man's search.  Will he tell it?

      As mutterings filled the halls and rafters a few solitary voices
234 hailed the newest quest proposed and quite a few more hailed for more ale.
235       At the time, I was no more than a simple ranger who knew a few more
236 tricks than the competition. And of course, the tricks were always a little
237 more than unfair. Most of them involved simple mimickery, and illusions.
238       As the innkeeper was drafting more ales than he should have, everyone
239 proceded to drink a little more than they should have.
240       Finally, after a small ruckus which is best described as a war of the
241 great egos, the halls began to empty of people, trying to find some means
242 of transport.  Fearing for my mount, I hopped out the open window and fell
243 rather softly onto the ground. Tthe morning frost cracked as I landed and
244 my breath became a fume of white air. It was indeed a winter morning as we
245 left that day.

277      "Hardy adventurers! I hear your pleas, and you have heard mine. Cast me a
278 drink good innkeeper, toss me a chair might warrior, so that I may sit and drink
279 and tell you the tale of the evil that lurks the known realities and then, and
280 only then, will I ask you, good patrons, will you accompany me on this great
281 adventure."
282       The requested deeds done, Trainor took a long draw from the earthware
283 mug. Wiping the fine head from his bearded chin, he glanced around at the
284 assemblage before him. Oh what a lot I have fallen into, he thought, while
285 the eyes and ears of the patrons poised to hear his words. But these more
286 than any other are capable of defeating the enemy, and restoring order to
287 impending chaos. Trainor began.......
288       "As Bard pointed out, my Pell-mell vehicle is not the normal means of
289 transport in the ever-more complicated world of multi-reality travel. Pell-
290 mell is the work of my lands greatest minds. The blood sweat and tears that
291 went into the design and construction of this machine would be payed back
292 in magnitudes, or so our leaders thought. It offers an economical non-magical
293 way of spreading the fabric of the time-space continuum, delivering accurate
294 destinational convergences for up to three people at the time. It was intended
295 to market the Pell-mell through Galactic Mail-order, thereby cutting out the
296 middle man, and keeping costs low. Oh our ideas were grand, perhaps too grand,
297 and therein lies the rub. In the rush to get the Pell-mell to the masses who
298 unlike most of you are stuck in a single reality, the testing phase of the
299 project was shortened. We did do some testing certainly, but not nearly as
300 much as a continuum device such as the Pell-mell should get. Understand that
301 highly advanced mechanical instruments can be much more susceptible to the
302 entropic forces of nature than human powers of skill and magic. We didn't
303 understand this concept, and now, as a race, we have paid for it."
304       Trainor paused here and raised his mug once more. The seemingly captive
305 audience did not shift; they were transfixed by the story Trainor laid
306 before them. He continued.
307       "It is ironic that I, the only survivor of our land, was partly
308 responsible for the destruction that followed. I was in the testing
309 program, in fact I was testing the same Pell-mell I used to get here
310 today. I was testing multi-shifts, that is jumping reality bands in
311 increments larger that one..."
312        A gasp from the rear of the assemblage stopped Trainor cold in mid-
313 sentence. "Ah ha, I see someone understands something about what we were doing.
314 Anyway, I was approaching the ZEB end of the reality scale, and my increments
315 were set to ten. It didn't hit me until after I broke the barrier that de-
316 creasing incremental jumps must be done one at a time. I heard the ZEB warning
317 claxon, but combined with my high increment and my close proximity to the
318 ZEB, the Pell-mell crashed through! I was thrown into a vortex of unbelievable
319 dimensions, and it is only due to the fine construction of the Pell-mell that
320 I survived the initial pass-through. But I was through, and I quickly
321 realized I had gone where no living reality-traveller had gone before, into
322 the ZEB zone. I knew I must get out quick, for the laws of surreality did
323 not hold anywhere but the known reality spectrum. I hit the auto return
324 panel which would immediately return me to a preprogrammed initial point.
325 The next few moments are a bit sketchy, but what I guess happened is that
326 I cut out of ZEB, I took a piece of ZEB with me, the ZEB space that I had
327 inhabited while I was there. When the exterior image cleared, and I realized
328 I was back home, I simultaneously realized that something was amiss. The
329 image in the viewport shimmered, and a black void started to engulf everything
330 in sight. I saw the black tracers coming at me, and near-panic stricken I
331 jabbed the control panel and shifted to another near-by reality. There the
332 shock of what happened must of caught up with me, for I don't remember
333 anything until I was awoken by a creature from the new reality knocking on
334 the Pell-mell, which had apparently landed somewhere near its settlement."
335        "What about your homeland?" someone piped in.
336        "Yes, I returned a couple days later, and I found what I told you as
337 I first came in. Barren waste-land. No life, no trace of my people. Everything
338 gone. The space from ZEB destroyed everything, that is the only thing I can
339 figure. It too has vanished, but it is sure to return and destroy another
340 reality. You must help me stop it! I can not forget that I am the executioner
341 of my race, and I am the only survivor!"
342         With this cry, Trainor hung his head and was silent. He knew he must
343 let the others contemplate what he had told them. Would they help him? He knew
344 not what they would think. Only time could tell him that.

370   It was terrible when I started remem-
371 bering back when I got in my accident.  It was really terrible.  It all happenedone day when I was strolling through 
372 the woods and saw a deer not to far in
373 the distance.  I started for my attack
374 the deer saw me and starting taking off
375 I couldn't do without food another day. I had to catch this one.  But I just 
376 couldn't get that movie Bambi out of
377 my mind.  I was finally catching up
378 with the deer, I was just a few feet
379 away when I was suddenly hit and thrown
380 a few hundred feet into the air.  I 
381 fell straight on the pavement.  It
382 was a state highway, and I was hit
383 with a car going about 80 mph.  I
384 couldn't think straight for a while.
385 Then when I finally came to my senses
386 I realized that the deer was also hit
387 and lying on the other side of the 
388 road.  As I tried to get onto my feet
389 I realized my right front leg was gone
390 I just couldn't believe it.  I finally
391 managed to get to me three remaining
392 feet and slowly crossed the highway
393 to the deer.  The deer was not moving
394 and I really felt bad because I was
395 the one that caused the accident to
396 happen in the first place.  I tried
397 all I could do to help the deer but
398 it looks as though he was really hurt
399 so I pulled him across the highway
400 and pulled him to my den.  The deer
401 was now coming to his senses.  I was
402 thinking that the deer would think
403 I was going to hurt him but he 
404 anxiously started licking me.  I was
405 his best friend.  I decided to call
406 him Buck, and he called me Three.
407 We nursed each other back to health
408 and were both ready to go on with
409 our lives.  The next day me and
410 Buck were going to get some food....

425 	I can't believe how damn boring this has gotten to be!  Some of the
426 	entries above would be nice to read, only if they were something less
427 	than 100+ lines, my god, who can sit through that?  Did I hear someone
428 	talking about brain damaged people? Reminds me of the 40 column entry
429 	a few lines up...brain damage!  
430 	This board needs something, I don't know what, but something that will
431 	catch the interest of people.  Something that everyone can take part
432 	in and understand, not just a small group of people. We are not all
433 	perfect. Or is that we are all not brain damaged...

435 I think this writing stories that are long are boring should stop also.  Who wants to read 200 lines of almost nothing.

449    I streached out as I woke from my calm and peaceful sleep  atop 
450 one of the tables in the Inn.  I shook all the cricks out of myself 
451 as I listened to someone talking about a "pell-mell" of sorts., and 
452 INTEERGALAKTICK travel through the DEeEEMENSHONS. (I'm not all that 
453 familiar with Common Tongue.)  But I could tell, from listening to h
454 his plea for help, that here was someone who REALLY needed aid.  I 
455 got up and once again streached out.  I xad been sleeping for, oh 
456 how long had it been, maybe 3 days, and it felt good to get out of my
457 my dormant state.  
458   My ears flipped up to their full height as the potency of this 
459 newcomer's words seeped into my sleepy mind.  I yawned and wondered if I had
460 really been asleep for 3 days, because I was still tired.  
461    Then the newcomer finished his tale.  By this time my mind had recoverfrom
462 it's state of what I called "Jell-o dormancy." and I heard this new face
463 to the Inn ask for help. 
464    "I'm iNn!" I said, hopping onto the shoulder of the man who had spoken.
465    The man looked at me curiously.  Then, lowly, he stroked my head.
466 Trainer: I'm in.  I need some spark.  All work and no adventure makes Zephyr
467 a dull rabbit! Count this furball into the story.  I'll try to help.  I know 
468 lots about the forest, so you can count on me!
469 Emu: I thought you were a chair because someone *said* you were a chair.  Don't look at me!
470 :::::=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::==Zephyr:::=====:::::=====:::::=====:::::=====

487   this is fr too late for me to be here.  i ought to sleep, yet to lie
488 down alone causes my mind to drift along a thousand paths.  all of
489 them keep my eyes open, staring at the walls of white that i have
490 tryed to cover with something i can say i created.  there they stand,
491 my drawings of bi-planes and my knack for dragons, and.
492   he gave me that picture.  it doesn't much look like him as i last 
493 saw him for it was taken four years before i met him, but it is still
494 him in that picture.  what i said of not being in love was false, it
495 is only the state he projects to me.  i want to reach out and hold on
496 to him.  the thousand paths become one, it is the way out of my
497 miserable little studio...  down the hall, out the door and off to
498 pray that he will visit me again.  but it's been so long..............

503 just curious --  No, I do not live in the Milwaukie area, it's not my pipes
504 that you hear.  However, this Saturday the Portland Highland Games will be
505 taking place out at David Douglas school -- it's worth a try if you like the
506 sound of the pipes.
507 pppppppppppppppppppppp
508   The piper inspected the reed he was carving with a critical eye.  Just a
509 small change -- he applied the razor-sharp knife to the critical throat of
510 the reed -- DAMN!  Sucking his bloody thumb, the piper left the remains of
511 the ruined reed on the table, his skean dubh in his stocking top, and moved
512 out of the shadows to the group surrounding the newcomer and his strange
513 machine.  Walking up to his friend Bard, the piper carefully inspected the
514 strange machine that had brought a new sense of purpose to the inn.
515   "Why do I hesitate?" he thought to himself.  Abruptly he spun and faced
516 the assembled group.
517   "Aren't we the bunch of heros though?" he asked abruptly.  "A person needs
518 help -- do we rush to his aid?  The very existence of his home is destroyed
519 do we avenge the wrong?  The prospect of an adventure no longer makes your
520 heart dance in eagerness?"
521   He lowered his head a moment then raised his eyes to the shocked gaze
522 of those not used to such an outburst.
523   "I apologize."  The words fell flatly from the piper's lips.  "Something
524 within me cannot recognize the prudence of weighing the merits of a quest."
525   Turning to Trainor he spoke the sacred words of comitment:
526    "Count me in."

530         "NET SCMEDT!" The angry words erupted from the mouth of Kyle Brackford
531 as he examined yet another report on the success of yet another NET mission in
532 southern California.
533         "But sir!", squeaked Brackford's assistant Jim Dunderson, "Our reports
534 show that this NET activity is merely a camouflage maneuver while some of
535 their top agents are off pursuing a 'Falcon.'"
536         "Falcon? Net's top agents are chasing after a bird? Come now Dunderson,
537 you can do better than that."
538         "Not a bird sir, Falcon is a literary term meaning central theme or
539 objective. NET is definitely after a Falcon, but as yet we haven't figured
540 out what the Falcon is. We do know that the Falcon exists in the Bay area
541 though. We also know that three agents were dispatched to retrieve this
542 Falcon. That is all we can determine from the decoded messages and other
543 intelligence gathering sources."
544         "I see, a Falcon. I take it we do not know the names of the three
545 agents? Just that there are three agents?"
546         "That is correct sir. We do know something about who is not present on
547 the mission though. Agent Joshua, one of NET's top men seems to be in a
548 bit of disfavor with Ian Machinery. We learned this from an undercover bellboy
549 at NET's exclusive Nirvana health club. It seems as if Joshua has acted with
550 little regard for decorum lately, and Ian doesn't like it at all. Joshua is
551 still at Nirvana, awaiting orders from Machinery that may not come in the
552 near future..."
553         "Or until an emergency requires his special services."
554         "Sir?"
555         "Yes, don't you see, SAD could send in some men into the Bay area, and
556 perhaps they could stumble onto NET's Falcon before NET does. Ian would have to
557 call in all of his big guns. Joshua would make a bee-line from Nirvana to NET's
558 Bay area offices. We of course, would follow."
559         "Brilliant sir! Shall I begin preparations?"
560         "Yes, and the next voice I want to hear will be telling me that all operations are go, and t
561         "Of course sir." Dunderson barely whispered.
562 ERROR IN UPLOAD. RETRY.
563         "Yes, and the next voice I want to hear will be telling me that all
564 operations are go, and the SAD agents are already on their way to California.
565 You have the information. You know the logistics. Send a half-dozen class G
566 agents. Now snap to it!"
567         "Of course sir." Dunderson barely whispered.
568         Alone in his office, Brackford had a moment to reflect. "I have you
569 now Machinery. You have crossed SAD to many times in your long and illustrious
570 career. No longer will you be kicking sand in our faces. It is SAD's turn to
571 do some kicking! I can hardly wait..."
