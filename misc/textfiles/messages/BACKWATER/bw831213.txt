42    TRI-METing Patrons:
43        It appears that both T-M lines 5 and 6 transect Hayden Island, yet
44 it is quite possible that 5 dosn't stop on the island. Line 5 runs every
45 (average) 20 mins. from 8:30 am to 9:30 pm; while 6 runs every (avg.) 30.
46 As I don't have a timetable handy, it is possible that 6 dosn't go out to
47 the island between 8:30 am and 4:00 pm (there is a notation of cryptic
48 meaning on the map). Will check on both possibilities and keep everyone
49 informed.

63 d:I must explain my reaction to the dragon sketch you showed me at the Bit 
64 Bucket party. As soon as I saw it, I immediately visualized it as the second
65 of three pictures. #1: the "fierce dragon" rushes up to the lady.
66 #2: your lovely sketch.
67 #3: the dragon rears back and retreats in GREAT disorder (hopefully
68 he will be smart enough to apoligize to the lady first!)

74 
75 
76 The sport of professional dragon hunting is among the most 
77 misunderstood of the blood sports. The response to my first 
78 DRAGON ALERT indicates that there is some confusion about 
79 dragon hunting among the patrons of the Inn. With your 
80 permission I'd like to take a moment to clarify.
81 
82 DJJ: Most importantly (and I am truly distraught over this 
83 misunderstanding) I must tell you that I would never dream 
84 of killing dragons such as you have seen. Most people don't
85 realize (perhaps d can confirm this) that there are two 
86 main catagories of dragons...Eastern dragons and Western 
87 dragons.
88 
89 Eastern dragons are the kind benevolent, and thoroughly 
90 generous creatures you have encountered. They come primarily 
91 from Asia and first entered this country with the chinese 
92 laborers who worked on the railroads at the turn of the 
93 century. They often are found among puffy white clouds and 
94 are often seen adorning oriental artwork.
95 
96 Western dragons, on the other hand, are fierce, vile, and 
97 murderous beasts that prey on livestock, innocent children, 
98 and virgins. They are obsessed with hoarding treasure and 
99 are extremely dangerous when aroused. They are a threat to 
100 mankind and must be destroyed.
101 
102 Dropped Bit: I in no way intended to infringe on an area of 
103 expertise claimed by d. In fact, it was a reference to the 
104 artwork of d that inspired me to speak. Hard though it is 
105 to believe, not everyone shares my enthusiasm for dragons. 
106 Word of a fellow dragon enthusiast was most welcome. However, 
107 the fact remains that I am THE GRAND DRAGONMASTER and, to 
108 the best of my knowledge, am the unequaled authority on the 
109 subject. 
110 
111 For those interested in learning more about Eastern and 
112 Western dragons I recommend you read "The Book of the 
113 Dragon" by Judy Allen & Jeanne Griffiths or "The Truth about 
114 Dragons" by Rhoda Blumberg. A historical perspectives on 
115 dragons can be found in "Dragons" by Peter Hogarth and the 
116 book "Dragons" by Pamela Wharton BlanPied is an outstanding 
117 work on dragon infestation.
118 
119 Out of respect for those who are not dragon enthusiasts I will 
120 say no more about them on this disc.
121 
122 
123                         Respectfully
124 
125                         GRAND DRAGONMASTER

131   >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>   20:00   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
132      On behalf of all the kind souls who've requested my presence:  yes
133 I shall muster my courage in response to your gentle pleading & resist
134 the impulse to flee!  With me, I hope to have as a companion the Lady
135 Altair, whom some may remember as a traveler who tarried briefly here
136 in the spring of the year.  Thank you, Alex, for your suggestion, but
137 the colours I wear are usually quiet and subdued, and I could not bear
138 the pretense of a disguise unbefitting to my personality!
139      Leonard, what an exquisite interpretation!  Many only remark upon
140 what they perceive as foolishness:  how dare she defy the great power of
141 this beast, they exclaim!  Their imagination runs on a narrow track...
142      (Ah, the nature of dragons:  here is your controversy, Innkeeper!)
143 I have kept still regarding creation vs. evolution out of respect for
144 the patrons who wearied of it, DJJ; but when the stream stagnates again,
145 I am willing, upon request, to make response to this challenge once more.
146      Pam, I add my plea to our dear Innkeeper:  where are you?  Our
147 peace-keeper is missed!  Won't YOU make an appearance at the festivities?
148      Your appellation of "famous Dragon expert" was most flattering, Sir
149 dROPPED bIT; but I must protest that it is untrue.  Though possessing a
150 smattering of knowledge of the history and lore of conventional dragons,
151 my renderings of the same are unique to me, though they bear a kinship
152 to the creatures of Pern.  Should they encounter a soul such as our local
153 Dragon Hunter, they would be indignant at his fixed ideas, then delight
154 in befuddling him in his clumsy efforts to attack them!
155      Dragon Hunter, if I may address you:  I enjoy the studious interest
156 you take in those honorable and/or dastardly creatures of legend, but to
157 view destruction of the same as a 'professional sport' is distasteful to
158 me.  There could be much more admirable motives for fighting a dragon--
159 and I think you discredit their intelligence and ingenuity by clumping
160 them in as if they are just another hunted animal!  According to the
161 masses of disinterested people, yes, dragons could be placed in "two
162 main categories" but the ones I appreciate the most conform to no 
163 category!  DJJ made a poignant comment about the 'creature responsible
164 for the destruction' as being "the most malicious of all, Man."  That,
165 along with some observations on artistic renderings of dragons, triggered
166 an idea about what makes respective dragons' personalities so radically
167 different:  'tis the loving touch of a woman!  Ponder:  was it not Anne
168 McCaffrey who penned those loyal and wise Pernese dragons?  The angry
169 faces of my early dragons gave way to warmth and humor when I began to
170 be influenced by the suggestions of the Lady Altair, as another example,
171 and two--no, three!--women artists I stumbled across at the Saturday
172 Market breathe into their creations liveliness and beauty without the
173 prerequisite grimness that males seem to think is required...

175 MAYHAP WE WILL BE SO LUCKY AS TO SEE A DRAGON WAITING IN THE PA
176 LOT, BUT IF NOT A MERE FIRE LIZARD WILL SUFFICE. IS THE NEW PERN BOOK

183 I was once told the saga of the Dragon's of Pern from a wisened seer of
184 the East.  They come in many different hues; gold and green, bronze 
185 brown and blue.  There are even tales of a fabled white Dragon.  I
186 think that perhaps the Dragon Hunter would be soundly defeated by these
187 supreme beasts.  Some say that they can teleport through space and
188 time and breathe fire after chewing a phosphine-bearing rock...The seer
189 spoke of their great intelligence and devotion to their riders.  They
190 contribute more to the salvation of mankind against the dreaded Thread
191 than anyone or anything else...Dragon Hunter beware of the Pernian
192 Dragons, they are not to be triffled with!

195 Ray:  No, "Moreta, Dragonlady of Pern" just came out in hardback.  You'll
196 probably have to wait four to nine months for the paperback version.
197 
198 Aaron:  Your system sounds like an excellent idea.  Just don't exclude
199 people because they are lurkers.  Every writer needs someone to read
200 his work.

242 
243 Dragon Enthusiasts:
244 
245 As promised I will not hold the next @DRAGON ALERT until the 
246 next disc. However, I'd like to briefly respond to some of 
247 your comments.
248 
249 d: My reference to dragon hunting as a "professional blood 
250 sport" was a poor choice of words. I over-stepped my literary 
251 license. I hope it doesn't get revoked.
252 
253 I first created Dragon Hunters International to develop 
254 imagination among severely emotionally disturbed and mentally 
255 ill children I worked with in the secure (locked) residential
256 treatment facility at Christie. Highly structured behavior 
257 modification programs reward conformity and mediocrity. Dragon 
258 Hunting was originally my attempt to inspire creativity in 
259 children whose only rewards in life were for "appropriate" 
260 behavior. 
261 
262 Though I've read a bit of Anne McCaffery, I find I prefer 
263 earthly dragons to those of Pern. They are more socially 
264 and spiritually relevant.
265 
266 CYM: There is absolutely no relationship between this Grand 
267 Dragon Master and the one heading the Klu Klux Klan. You might 
268 be relieved to learn that I periodically donate money to 
269 Klanwatch, the arch enemy of the KKK.
270 
271 There are many misconceptions about dragons and dragon hunting 
272 in our great nation. I hope the visitors to the Inn will find 
273 my humble words enlightening...or at least pleasantly amusing.
274 
275                         your humble servant
276 
277                         GRAND DRAGON MASTER

282 
283  C.Y.M.&T.D.P.: Yes, I agree. Yet the structure of my system will be dependant on
284 the unihibited freedom Unicom will offer; absolute anonymity (as many 
285 aliases as you can dream up, and the system will recognise them all), abs-
286 olute freedom of pen (the wise will say the absolute freedom is nothing but
287 anarchy, and yes this is so, so i will accept suggestions from the users to
288 purge other members from their ranks if their languange becomes too "un-
289 acceptable"), and wide formats and various forums (including private/group
290 mail, SIG's, and a "room" system), along with tight yet simple security.
291  Because of the "freedom" in my system, and the SYSOP's "hands off" philos-
292 ophy for the regulation of the system (I liken my "hands off" philosophy to
293 Star Trek's classic "non-interference" dictum); the only REAL measure of 
294 control of the "cleanness" is the requirement that prospective members prove
295 to me some semblance of responsability (though not spelling) from previous
296 BBS activities. 
297  As to lurkers, and audiences, I will try to encourage a large enough cast
298 of players so that some can take the role of awed lurker on occasion.
299                                                              Aaron

382 No...Dragon Hunters International has nothing to do with D & D.
383 
384 Originally Dragon Hunters International was a club I made up 
385 for kids with emotional problems. Now it has almost as many 
386 adult members as kids (about 15 kids to 10 adults) b
387 don't do much anymore.
388 
389 Membership requirements for kids are:
390 
391      1) You must name, describe, and explain the habit 
392         three dragons.
393 
394      2) You must name and describe your own personal monster.
395 
396      3) You must make a sound like a dragon.
397 
398 
399 Members of Dragon Hunters International had their own money, 
400 called Krauntars, that could only be spent on imaginary things 
401 that do not exist.
402 
403 The club hasn't met in several years but it has card carrying 
404 members all over town.

437 =============================================================
438 C.Y.M.:Nuclear War (or even limited terrorist use of nukes is NOT the only
439 thing that "survivalists are trying to prepare for/against. Natural 
440 Disasters, & economic collapse are also possibilities. Also, if it IS as bad
441 as you seem to think, then even our best efforts would be useless. If it 
442 ISN'T that bad ONLY those who were prepared would stand much chance of
443 surviving. You are in effect saying that since it would be terrible to be
444 one of the survivors of a great disaster, plague, war, etc then we shouldn't
445 try to be prepared for the aftermath. That kind of thinking was prevalent 
446 after the black death struck Europe. Many people felt that it was God's
447 Judgement & just gave up. Luckily, not everyone did or we might not be here.
448 DRAGONMASTER (& d):In my persona as a member of the Society for Creative
449 Anachronism, I have had some dealings with dragon-related matters. The Shire
450 of Stromgard (Vancouver, Wa & vicinity) annually holds a defender tournament
451 to select the "fighter" who will protect the Shire & surrounding territories
452 from the Dragon that lairs in Mt. St. Helens. Note that he is not being 
453 chosen to kill the dragon (rumor has it that she is raising a fine brood of
454 dragonets in the crater rim!), but merely to protect us. At least one of
455 the Defenders has claimed that he spent his term playing chess with her. He 
456 also claims to have won most of the games, informed sources tend to doubt 
457 this. It is thought that the Dragon wished to spare his feelings & LET him
458 win so he wouldn't feel too bad. (Besides, if he kept losing he might quit!)
459 dROPPED bIT:OK, but this is your last chance!

463 But Leo, aren't the survivalists "giving up"? They are saying that there
464 is no hope, that society is doomed, and we should all dig in and get
465 ready to protect what's ours. It isn't the people that run away that solve
466 the world's problems, it's those that stay and fight, that try to SOLVE
467 the problems, that give us the chance to survive.  The "survivalists" 
468 are survivalists only through personal survival, and their actions may
469 actually help further the collapse they fear. If they are so far-sighted,
470 they would be of more service by staying in society and helping rather
471 than running away. If the collapse does come and they are the fathers
472 of the world to come, we can look forward to a group of small-minded,
473 selfish decendants ruling the bombed out remains of our world. I don't
474 see you hiding in a shelter in the Rogue River Valley, so you must feel
475 some duty to society. Or is it just what defines the majority of everyone's
476 actions, inertia?

480 I would like to say that I feel that Dragons are beautiful creatures
481 and I am very happy to have a small collection of artwork depiciting them.
482 It is good to see the subject matter of BWMS turn over to such a delightful
483 subject.  I am not really interested about arguing on war, or any
484 such trifle matters.  But, Dragons are a subject I will be happy to listen
485 /read about.  Thank you for the book references.  Enjoy.

510   I just called MT Bottle & Deli. They were...uh...surprised. The building
511 has a capacity of 55, though they said they've had more. Note that I didn't
512 give them the OFFICIAL warning, yet I did metion that a few people might 
513 show up tommorow. I would suggest that SOMEONE give them a call with a real-
514 istic estimation of the size of the throng they will be innundated with.

543 blade) Seltznic.
544      Sure, LeRoy's not much. We all know he's greedy, 
545 politically unstable, and always in trouble...but at least 
546 his hearts in the right place. That's more than you can say 
547 about Rosco the Blade.
548      Rosco will bring you nothing but pain. For my sake, if 
549 for no other reason, please, oh pretty please, don't secumb 
550 to his treacherously brutal charms.
