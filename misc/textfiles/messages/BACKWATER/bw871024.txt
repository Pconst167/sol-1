141      New Lands (Sheji's story) continues...
142  
143      Momentarily puzzled the cat pawed tenatively, claws half extended, at
144 Sheji's exposed right hand, the one cluching the instrument case's handle.
145 The sudden thrill of pain shouted jump but Sheji niether flinched nor
146 cried out.  With amusement he wondered how the more aggressive of his
147 school aquaintences would have reacted.  
148      Instead, gently he sat the case down betteween himeself and the great
149 cat so as to change grip with his other hand.  With his own tounge he cleaned 
150 the shallow scratches.  His blood's rich salty taste reminding Sheji that 
151 sooner or later he would have hunger to deal with as well.
152      As an experiment of his own Sheji backed a couple of paces.  The cat
153 did not, as he feared it might, fallow.  Not even, as best he could tell,
154 stir at all.  It seemed to be guarding something.  A mother with kittens
155 perhaps or maybe a matter of territory.  In eather case he felt ill inclined
156 to press his luck.
157      The cave was not as completely dark as it had at first appeared.  He
158 could now make out the cat's relaxed, watchfull form.
159      Slowly to avoid alarm, he opened the case.  Good hand holding the far
160 half, with the injured he carefully undid the internal straps and fitted 
161 the mouth piece.  Hopping to murphy it wouldnt slam shut he let go the good 
162 hand and firmly took the horn in both.  It waited   seemingly stable
163 for the instrument to all but reach his lips.
164      Springing to its feet in alarm, the long fanged cat, now clearly vissible,
165 hissed in his direction.  Though in alarm it sprang back rather than forword,
166 curiosity soon overcame both protectiveess ans caution.  With nose and
167 wiskers twitching, extending neck, it slowly approached.
168      When the beast was almost too close, Sheji sounded the first note.  Its 
169 perplexed reaction would have been more amusing had its intentions been 
170 morre clearly harmless.  With little hope, Sheji began to play.
171 To his great relief the cat relaxed and seemed genuinely to enjoy the sound.  
172 An accompanyment soon joined, woorisome at first, till its souce became plain. 
173 The great cat was purring!
174      For an eternity he continued, as much to sooth himself as his new and
175 as yet uncertain companion.  Not untill the cat sprang to its feet for no
176 immeediatly appearent reason, turned in its own length, and bounded off down
177 the passage away from him, did Sheji stop.
178       The fading echo of the horn's last notes were rreplaced by those of a 
179 voice, tone deaf but cheerful, coming from the direction in which the cat
180 had dissappeared.
181      Repacking the horn, Sheji fallowed.

184 I'm a little surprised. A lot of input the last few days and then nothing...
185 I dont care what other people say....I like it here!
186  
187 <zzzzz>---    <zzzzzz>---    <zzzzzz>---- Were coming to get you VanderVecken
188  
189   The door opened where none had been before. The head that stuck itself in
190 drew little notice even though it wore an extremely confused expression. 
191   The confused expression belonged to a female, about 5'8", with green eyes
192 and strawberry-blonde hair that disappeared into the light beyond the door.
193 She looked around for a few minutes.
194   "Tag!", a voice came from beyond the door. "What do you see in there?"
195   "Well, nothing remarkable. Looks like a bar, and a seedy one at that. Like
196 the one out of Blade Runner. Seems harmless, but it still makes me nervous."
197   "Well,"came another voice gruffly from beyond, "will you kindly move your
198 rear so that someone else can come through? I ain't so shy"
199   "Oh, alright, Jordan. It's your life." The lady was clearly reluctant to 
200 move through doors that opened without any good reason. The other though....
201   Jordan Sisk strode in, dressed in black, cape billowing in the draft. Using
202 his good eye, he looked left, then right, then walked over to a table in a 
203 dark corner. Seeing that he could do so unmolested, his companions walked in:
204   *The lady.
205   *A short person who in the dim light might be mistaken for female due to his
206 long hair and fine features. A closer inspection would show pointed ears. An 
207 elf.
208   *A human with long hair bound in a ponytail and a headband with a solid red
209 circle on. Across his back was strapped an electric bass. He looked as though
210 he was looking for a stage to perform on, as though he were in search of the 
211 missing gig.
212   *Another human who also had long hair, unbound, wearing glasses. He carried
213 himself as though he were leading the group, when the reality was that the 
214 group only let him believe this.
215   *Yet another human-appearing character, who had an air about him that was 
216 most alien.
217   They all walked to the same corner as their friend, and sat down about him.
218 They all looked out of place except Jordan, who with his eyepatch and attitude
219 looked as though he were gathering a mercernary force. The companions about him
220 would make a passerby imagine that he had low standards in such an endeavor.
221   The group then began debating about what to order-or indeed how to order.
223 The conversation was interrupted by a curious thing-a humming noise. It seemed
224 to be coming from the floor. 
225    The group looked about. They couldnt see it at first. Then the elf, looking
226 low, spotted something with a start.
227    "Well now!" he exclaimed.
228    "What is it, Eagle?" the lady asked.
229    Eagle held up a hand."Hold on, Tag, its...saying something. I think its...
230 saying?...somthing"
231    The elf bent down. They could all see it now...a small shoebox sized thing.
232 It looked exactly like a tank that had escaped from a video game. It was hum-
233 ming in a modulated fashion...
234    "You want what...or who?" Eagle asked."Oh. Oh. Sorry, I don't think any of
235 us can help you. Sorry. Yeah, you have a nice day too."
236    The elf sat up.
237    "Well," the bespectacled one asked. "What did it say?"
238    "Justin, do you know a Van--derVecken?"
239    "I've run into him. Why?"
240    "Strange...That little thing just wanted to know where it could find 
241 VanderVecken. Would'nt say why, though."
242    Justin smiled wide.
243    "I think, my friend, its a good thing we did'nt tell him."
244  
245 will be continued if I ever get a real idea.

410 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^THE MUSE^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ah! it's good to be home^^^^
411 Yes, all ye good people, THE MUSE has returned.  Took an unofficial vacation
412 to the land of Neurotica.  Yup, you got it.  Even sweet little deities like
413 me have nervous breakdowns.  Mine last for months.  
414    I think nervous breakdowns are a little like malaria.  Once you've got it,
415 you've got it.  It just lifts off of you for a while, then comes home for a
416 wile, then decides to go to Tijuana for a short siesta, then comes home for
417 dinner, stays put for a fes months, decides that skiing in the Alps would be
418 a nice idea...you get the picture.  They may go for a vacation, a little fun-
419 in-the-sun, but it always comes home.  Why not move? I hear milions of
420 electronic voices cry,Leave no forewarding address. ah, my friends, carrier
421 pidgeons alays fnd their way home.  They have little homing devices tied to
422 thier little feetsies.  There's no escaping the GREAT BLACK DEPRESSION.  
423 So we go along our merry way, pretend that we really don't feel the burden
424 on our back, whistle a cheerful tune, and pray to the gods above that it will
425 all be over soon, and we can go to a better place.  It's the great 
426 American Pasttime.  Doen't you just love feeling you mind rip itself apart?
427 Don't you adore the sensation of tousand of minds pressing on your, swallowing 
428 you whole, devouring you very existence?  Don't you rejoice when you feel
429 the wet-blanket-cloud of melacholy descend on your heart, tuck you in for
430 your nap, as you listen to the winds shreik and howl with horrid laughter?
431 Oh, I have many miles to go before I sleep.  Endless journeys through
432 unseen terrors, all of my own devising.
433 "Why not get help?"  The voices cry out again?  My sweet, naive friends, who
434 is there to help?  Send me to a doctor, He'll say I have the blues, that it's
435 nothing to worry about, and he'll send me away with a pat on the head.  A pat
436 that dooms me to the mires and marshes and swamps of my own insanity.
437   I am doomed.
438 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^THE MAD MUSE^^^^^^^^^^^^^not quite so amused^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
439 ye gods, I'm morbid when I get in my moods, she MUSEd.

443      Seji's story (new lands) continues...
444      The fading tones of his horn were replaced by those of a voice, tonedeaf
445 but cheerful, comming from the direction in which the cat had dissappeared.
446 Horn replaced, he fallowed.
447      The sight to greet him at the passage's enterance was of a figure of
448 adult but otherwise indeterminate age, dressed head to foot in plyable leather
449 of reddish brown.  This worthy, scratching the great carnivour behind the ear
450 was plainly talking to it.
451      The figure turned at sedji's approach and like the cat regarded him with
452 detatched but not unfriendly gaaze.
453      The cat came to Sheji's side and rubbing itself besidee his thigh was
454 obviosly begging to be petted.  Tennatively he scratched behind an ear as
455 he had seen the other doing.  This prompted a deep and throaty purr.
456      "Milords, I see you've met." was the strainger's greeting.
457      "I seem to be a bit lost" Sheji repplied "could you tell me how to get
458 back to Colfax High School?"
459      "Prey forgive my simple manor young lord but your riddle is an odd one.
460 Of any place called Colfax I've not heard and while much is praised as noble,
461 I've heard of no school so worthy.  In the temple the priestesses run a kind of
462 school, that's as near as is in my power to guess."
463     Though not quite shattering, this news held little of meaning.  That
464 teaching might be an ajunct of religeon was a new thought.  Considering
465 that much of his difficulty in learning was due to a tendancy tword prop-
466 igandising and a predisposition toward emotional argument on the part of
467 teachers as he did know them, this boded not entirely well, however exotic
468 thies priestesses might otherwise prove to 
469 be.
470      "That doesn't sound quite like what I had in mind but I might as well go
471 find out.  Where might this temple be?" Sheji asked.
472      "In the village of Forrest Goat" he was told "which lies 12 miles to the
473 northeast though the quickest way to reach it is by road, 5 miles down the
474 ravine to the west."
475      "Prey no offense" the strainger continued "but have you no master to teach
476 you his trade?  Surely be you of an age to apprentice?"
477      th silence might have draged uncertainly on were not they at that 
478 moment interupted and sent scurrying for cover by an arrow poorly aimed,
479 or not aimed poorly enough. this was not at once appearent as to which.
480      When sufficient tine had passed to suggest the errent missle had been
481 a strey after all, and not the precursor of some premeditated attack,
482 Sheji's, he began to realize, host, waxed once more loquatios.
483  
484      "I prey I speak not out of turn but thats an awfully queer parcel to
485 which your arm seems all but perminently attched to."
486      "Oh that?  Just my horn."
487      "A horn?"
488      "Care to see it?"
489      "If you would..."

491 ===========================Justin the Blue==================================
492 Ye gods! Signs of life on this board at last...............!
493    MUSE:I have a few thoughts on nervous breakdown. When I was being escort-
494  ed out of the Navy I did get to see a doctor Who prescribed me a most 
495  wonderful drug, an antidepressant that was powerful enough to give me head
496  rushes from simply thinking about getting up and movin. The world seemed
497  very odd for a while. Kind of a combination of "why bother" and "well, why
498  not. I was then sent to a hospital where I was basically made harmless to
499  myself if not others then given an honorable discharge. Then I became the
500  legend you know me as today. The problem was not solved. The symptoms were
501  merely ameliorated, and as you have said, show up from time to time, gener-
502  ally having much more fun w/life than I am at any given time. 
503    It's as the lyric in the Howard Jones song,"no one is to blame":
504         "doctor says youre cured-but you still feel the pain."
505    I guess I'm just a little too cynical sometimes. Sorry. I try not to live
506  up to TOO many incarnations of my name.
507  
508     <ZZZZZZ>----  <ZZZZZZZ>---- <ZZZZZZZ>----- Mayhaps have you seen
509                                          a small furry being with a
510                                          long hairy name????????????
511  
512     They had taken no watches with them(foolishly) but could easily tell
513 it was getting late in the day. If in fact they had days here. Very prob-
514 ably the sun never set. But no one seems to care..........
515     The bass player became restive. As time passed the small group could
516 see him picking out scales:first slowly, then faster and faster as the ennui
517 increased. He alone had ordered nothing to drink, stating quite plainly in
518 his Birmingham lilt that "I dont care to be out of control."
519     Sure, Justin thought to himself, not just yet anyway. You havent found
520 a lady or a.....
521     The two looked to the front, beyond most of the patrons.
522     There was a stage. 
523     "do you see what I see", said Eagle in awe. "I mean that wasnt there
524 when we came in here was it?"
525     Even Jordan had lifted his eyepatch to bring his weak eye into play.
526     "no, " Jordan said, "at least I dont think so...No, it wasnt there." the
527 rogue began to sink back and blend in with the seat. Apparently his trust of
528 the place was waning from its initial low point to somewhere near the core
529 of the planet.
530     "How wild" was all Tag would say. Justin remained quiet at this point.
531     "I sense a cue here", Rebel said. Needing no more prompting he was beg-
532 inning to rise. "but, i havent got a band you know," he said turning back
533 to Tag.
534     "Look again."
535     The two turned back to the stage to find that there was indeed a band
536 there. 
537     "Smashing!" Was Rebel Morocco's only response. He proceeded and then the
538 jam session began. They played many of Rebels favorite covers (he loved 
539 E.L.O. and the Moody Blues most), but then degenerated into a random but
540 pleasant ramble with heavy fusion overtones. The rest of the group were 
541 haveing a pleasant time, and Rebel himself was in a state close to Nirvana
542 But after a rendition of Who tunes where Rebel found himself trying some
543 Entwistle style and (in his opinion anyway) pulling it off quite nicely
544 he found that the interest level was waning, and resolved to practice more.
545 He stepped down from the stage and the band faded from view behind him: 
546 Rebel looked quite satisfied.
547     He sat down, his Lady still over his shoulder, very reluctant to let
548 go. plainly it was a peak experience.
549     His Collegues were quite pleased as well. But a little confused.
550     "That was the coolest jazz I've heard in some time" said jordan.
551     "That orchestral manoeveur was magnificent." TAg said. "but wehere was that
552 enchanting string section"
553     "How did you make those things howl like wolves?" said Eagle.
554     "Very good my friend," said Justin, "but I know you know more than 
555 just E.L.O songs.
556     Rebel just sighed. He knew true genius was rarely fathomable.
557     But what was this? Eagle was talking again to a tank. 
558     "It said It liked that data, nice and solid."
559     Rebel Knew it was time to retire.

584 L'homme - Greetings, old friend.  If indeed you do exist.  I am convinced that 
585 I exist, because the Tax man believes in me.  SIL.
586 Actually, I have been reading a lot of esoteric stuff which supports my
587 'religious beliefs'  that in fact there is a higher power, and it is our
588 'collective imagination'.  The basic premise is that thought or conciousness 
589 (true conciousness being an amalgam of concious, sub and hyper concious) is the
590 only thing that is real.

601      "oh that?  Just my horn"
602      "A horn?"
603      "care to see it?"
604      "if you would..."
605      Its sight seemed a source of genuine amazement.
606      "so much metal - it looks a little like a horn - but - What be this - and
607 these?"
608      "There called valves"
609      "Vvalves?"  I've heard mechanicians speak of such but this is my first 
610 sight of any.  Do you play it?"
611      "like to hear it?"
612      "I'd greatly wish it though I've nought to repay save a pan of fish."
613      Sheji required no further prompting.  He played Greensleeves, the long
614 version, with variations.  When he was done his host sat stuned.     
615      "all that from a horn?  A fine jest to conciel your calling.  Surely you
616 are honored among bards!"
617      Oops again, Sheji thought, repacking the instrument. 
618      "I play well enough I guess - but I've got no - what do you call it -
619  stage pressence."
620      Just then the forrest's peace was shattered by a reverberating scrreetch.
621      "What in the seven blue blazes was that?"  Sheji asked.
622      "An explanation of much anmnd a ride into town if your quick.  A mer-
623 chanter carrivan down by the road calling in his hunters.  You've never heard
624 one?  No matter; down the trail and quickly."
625      "But what do I say to them?"
626      "Just say your a bard.  If any doubt, tell them Thuva of Forrest Goat
627 says so!"
628      Not without uncertainty, Sheji set off.  Not running, but walking with
629 a distance eating pace born of a childhood of long waalks alone in the woods.
630      The narrow winding path was easy ennough to spot, though dwelling on the
631 uncertainties ahead he noted little else.  He'd come, by his own guess, a good 
632 couple of miles when unexpectedly a low voice spoke almost in his ear.  
633 Startled, Sheji turned to see a tall adolescent, little older than himself,
634 dressed more in dust then the tattered jerkin and trews thhe dust concieled.
635      His air of assurance and the massive, well cared for, compound bow slung 
636 from one narrow sholder contrasted incongruosly.
637      "Who was that old man?" this young streinger asked.
638      "Called himself Thuva.  That wasn't you shooting at us?"  A question Sheji
639 instantly regretted, too late to unsay.
640      "Not you.  That damned cat.  Ran off the ringhorn I'd been stalkjkjking."
641      "Thuva shairs that cat's cave like a friend.  I'd not be the one to tell
642 him that.  Seemed less then pleased." Sheji added for good measure.
643      "Shairs a cave with a cat?  Maybe he's a hunter like me.  Chulan I'm 
644 called, with Jicha's carrivan."

661 Contrary to popular belief, a dictionary is practically useless for determining
662 the spelling of a word. You don't believe me? Try to find "noo-moan-ee-uh" 
663 (pnuemonia) in one! You have to know the spelling *before* you look the word
664 up.
665 	There are however, books that contain lists of *mis*-spellings followed 
666 by the correct spelling. They are usually marketed as "bad speller's

685 No, not at all.  You think while you are unconscious; you just don't realize
686 that you are thinking.  (Of course, if you read the Meditations, you find 
687 that Descartes is really saying, "I have to exist because I know that I'm
688 wondering if I exist, and SOMETHING has to exist to do the wondering."  Which
689 leaves your nonexitence wide open for philosophical debate.)
690  
691 Of course, these brilliant passages are immediately followed by such drivel
692 as, "God has to exist because I'm too much of a wimp to imagine an all-
693 powerful being," and, "God has to exist because he's perfect.  If he doesn't
694 exist, then that is a flaw in his perfection."  Which leads me to wonder how
695 someone so absolutely stupid could sound so brilliant.  Of course, it also
696 makes a strong statement about how teaching children that the existence of
697 God is fact really screws up their ability to think rationally about the
698 subject.  But don't get me started on THAT ... I'll fill the message!

702 That is however the standard construct used to "prove" the existance of
703 God. My experience has shown though that the real intent of the argument
704 is not to bring over new converts, but rather as a re-enforcement of the
705 concept to those that believe. It provides a loop-back in the thinking 
706 process on a path that would otherwise lead to questioning of God's 
707 existance. Not that that would be bad in and of itself, but it also
708 leads to questioning of those who proport to expound God's word. Maybe
709 they are really a bunch of con-men out to suck blood from the huddled
710 masses. The minute ideas like that being to seep in the rest of the real
711 (?) world also begins to flood through and in the end the person looses
712 his unquestioning belief in the religous pontif's rantings. Other ideas,
713 other concepts begin to take form. Perhaps there is more to life then
714 following the sayings of some protected pulpit pounder that has never
715 really spent his life in the activities of the people he controls.
716 Or worse to discover that he is only interested in reaping in the 
717 money the adulation brings and bask in the glow of insiped belief.
718 Turn your head from thoughts that don't fit my prescribed pattern.
719 They are the thougts of the devil and he will bring you ruin (or
720 perhaps it will really bring the preachin'man ruin since the knowledge
721 that he is not God's gift to the world would cause the poor little
722 sheep to become human once again and wise up to his manipulations).
723 If there is devilishness it is in the preacher for trapping the thoughts
724 and limiting the scope of those he controls. He creates a true hell
725 on Earth by preventing the people from growing and achieving their
726 true self. Instead they are the sheep in his flock passively following
727 his lead. Bleeding a little everyday in payment for him protecting them
728 from the outside world.

753 Before we can decide if there is a "supreme being" we first must define
754 what supreme being means.  After all, Reagan is the Supreme Commander of the
755 armed forces, but he controls nothing absolutely.  (Note the difference between
756 'Nothing absolutely' and 'absolutely nothing', an attribute which some say

773 is reported to have mysteriosly received a long list of violations.  A number 
774 of dissappearances of OSHA inspectors remain to be cleared up.
775      Amid accusations of foul play and counter accusations of sabitage, the
776 plant has remained shut down for over a year.
777      McCain has anounced plans to markit a new line of Santa masks in time for 
778 the christmas season.  They are to be released under the much clouded but
779 still familiar Silver Shamroc trademark.  Unconfirmed rumor has it that they
780 are to be produced at the currently closed Danburry plant.
781      McCain himself was not available for comment.

783      Ambassidor Themnax noted the above item with much interest.  Certain
784 'political officers' on his staff, who for obvios reasons shall remain nameles,
785 recently intercepted an unauthorized shipment from sources which must also,
786 for security reasons remain unspecified.  The 40 foot van contained packages of
787 a rare extraterestrial fungus.  This fungus resembles long, fine cottony 
788 silverwhite hairs.
789      On the world of its origeon, this fungus attachess itself to the chin of 
790 its host organism, giving it the resaulting appearance of having a long 
791 silverywhite beard.
792      What makes the silverbeard fungus especialy insidius is that it invades 
793 the central nervios system of its host.  Though not itself in any way sentient,
794 the Silverbeard fungus may be readily programed
795 to render its host psycologicaly suggestable in a number of ways.  This has
796 long been known to the crimminal communitty in a number of galactic regions. 
797 It has been used in a variety of scemes from as an aid to piracy to the estab-
798 lishment of planitary dictatorships.

811 I don't see how the concept that I or you exist (whether we truely do or
812 not is a whole nother issue) has any relation to whether God exists
813 either as a supreme being or other concept. The personalization of
814 God is just another ploy used by religion to keep the faith. The concept
815 is in fact the under-pinning of many of them. The usual argument is
816 "you must do as I say or God will punish you". God is a nice anchor
817 for them to hang on to and use as a shield from the world outside
818 their shell. If you don't believe in their God you are nothing and
819 God will send you to hell because you don't believe in him. 
820 Notice the term "supreme being" saying that God is a "being", and
821 the usual bit from the biblical types that God made man in his own
822 image. I think what is closer to the truth is that man made God in
823 man's image.

849 To all:  This is a very serious topic.  The old folks are running away
850 with the future, and we are letting them.  They just sent in petitions
851 to make sure that they get their COLAs in Social Security, and they 
852 were listened to.  Why?  Because they vote.  So the self serving 
853 politicians do exactly what they want.  As a result, the world financial
854 markets are going to look at us with a jaundice eye, and the whole
855 economy will g to hell in a handbasket.  When most people are fighting
856 for their lives, who do you think will survive?  Not the old people.
857 I propose the following:
858        1.  No one can get out of Social Insecurity any more than he or
859            she or spouse put into it.  Period.
860        2.  Any one who can not provide for them selves in their old
861            age obviously planned wrong.  Help them out with minimal
862            housing and food.  (Yes, warehousing.  At least I'm not 
863            into euthenasia.)  Families of people in such situations
864            should be *required* to assist.  After all, the now old
865            person was once a head of family.
866        3.  Be aware that social insecurity is *not* designee to be a
867            handout, but rather an insurance policy.  If you are so
868            shortsighted that you fail to account for your old age years,
869            then continue to be productive.

909 Some people call this force energy.
910 Some people call it life.
911 Others call it God.

914 forgetting that it's an explanation of what's going on in the world around them

916 since this life-force makes things exist, and this life force is god,
917    EVERYTHING IS GOD.
918 I know it sounds like Heinlein, but can I help it if the man was on the right
919 track?  At least in this area?
920 Anyway, tthese are just a few words from the pagan contingent, and even some of
921 them will argue with me.  But that's half of the beauty of it--god is whatever
922 you conceive him/her/them to be.  Super neet, huh?

934 Social Insecurity?  I think you will find the economy has already GONE to hell
935 in a handbasket. I am going to provide for my future in the following fashion;
936 I'll continue to work till I'm dead. I don't trust any other method.  Now I'm
937 going to deliver a message to all of those who are in positions of power in
938 the economy, one that I think most people my age would echo:
939    We (meaning under 25) know what you have done to our economy. We have no 
940 hope for our economic future. We do not believe in any of your excuses that you
941 have made to justify the trashing you have done to our economy, and we know
942 that you do not believe in any of them either. We know that eventually, when 
943 you are all dead, we will have to pick up the pieces and we don't forgive you
944 for it.  The only thing that we can take consolation in is that someday, when
945 you are all dead, and we have spent ourselves in righting the economy, there
946 will never never again be another generation that is as selfish as yours.
947    I hope to God that the Crash will come in your lifetimes, and take you with
948 it, because you will never ever see yourselves as the disgusting economic
949 monsters that you truely are.
950    Your generation is black on the economic pages of history.

956 Greetings Muse,
957 .
958      Glad to see you haven't abandoned us.  This board has been
959 getting quite dull of late.
960      I'm still here in the capital of the Emerald Empire.  Nothing
961 much is going on.  I'm enjoying the foggy mornings and the clear,
962 cold nights.  Very nice for stargazing.
963      Hope you and "Fur Face" find the time to drop in while you're
964 in town.  We could share some of that cake you left with me.
965      I'm not quite sure what you mean about your behavior on
966 Halloween.  I don't remember anything canine about it.
967      Until later...
968 .

978      23 lines dosn't look like enough room for a story installment soo...
979 a few raandom comments.
980      Every object or phenomina has an entrinsicness or at least an intrinsicnes
981 of type.  these intrinsicnesses are sacred in the sense that truth is sacred.
982 This is not to say everything has a soul and or is sentient.  I like the idea
983 of all those objects laughing at us.  its 'cute'.  But - anthhromorphism (which
984 is what such concepts frequently degenerate into) is the collective egotism of
985 a (our in this case) species.  This is not a good thing.  For one thing it 
986 tends to violate intrinscness.  Replacing it with arbitrarily preconcieved 
987 notions.  No objects need not be sentient to exist but we are and seem to and
988 something called entropy seems also to exist making it mighty pecular that 
989 anything exists at all.  Especialy anything as complex as our sentient selves.
990      My claim was only that this suggests the existance of SOMEthing in (or
991 out of?) 'the' universe that is greater then ourselves.  None of this realy
992 in any way specifies what the nature of that something (or somethings) might be
993      On a slightly other aspect: yes polarity is a valid concept and exists 
994 within a few narrowly deffined contexts BUT low levels of energy or third
995 order equavilent are NOT ANTIennergies, mierly low levels!
996       Finaly the one absolute certainty that all 'neo pagans' (and any and
997 all other players with cosmic silly putty for that mater) aggree upon is that 
998 there is no single point that is universaly aggreed upon!  Yup something realy
999 is there but how we perceive it is how WE perceive it!
