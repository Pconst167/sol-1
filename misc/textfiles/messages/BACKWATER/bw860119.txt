24    hAgAn watched as the men loaded the last of the crates into the cargo hold of his one man ship. They were grumbling
25 something about the lack of mechanical loaders but hAgAn ingored them. Loaders had to be schedueled at this busy port
26 and he had no time for such nonsense. Besides, if it wasn't for hard labor, humans would have no use at all. They
27 should be paying him. He turned to the cargomaster in charge and said, "I Am gOIng tO gO tO stArt Up thE wArp
28 gEnErAtOrs. hAvE yOUr mEn sIgnAl mE whEn thE shIp Is sEcUrE. tAkE Off Is In nInE mInUtEs."
29    Marik grunted as he lifted the last crate into the hold. Even for a small ship, it wasn't carrying much. Just some
30 supplies and that black coffin. He had been around enough to know what it really was and wondered who was in it. Oh,
31 well, it was none of his affair. He was being paid enough not to worry. "Okay, that's the last- Hey!"
32    He had all but tripped over the box. It was about a meter on each side, made of a silver material, and sealed with
33 the same mark as the others. "What the hell is this? Where'd it come from?"
34    The cargomaster looked at his sheet. This crate wasn't listed... No, there it was. Funny, he could've sworn that
35 space was blank a minute ago. "Last minute arrival, I guess. Load it in with the rest, and let's go."
36    Grumbling, Marik picked up the box, which was surprisingly light. Something shifted inside as he carried it in. He
37 carried it over by the black crate and let it drop with a thud. He cocked his head and listened for a second. Was that
38 a yelp he heard? No, couldn't be. From outside the cargomaster yelled, "Be careful with that! It's marked
39 fragile."
40    "I'll mark you with somethin'." He mumbled as he stepped out of the hold. The cargomaster picked up his tranciever
41 and told hAgAn they were finished. A moment later the cargo hatch closed and sealed itself. The loaders stepped back
42 as the ship was wheeled to the launch port. Minutes later, the warpship rocketed into orbit.
43    In the cargo hold, the lid on the silver box swung upward. Tariya poked her head up, trying to get her bearings.
44 She stood up stiffly, trying not to aggravate her bruises. She almost hadn't pulled it off. The crate had been easy to
45 steal, but making them see what she wanted them to see had been a lot harder. So far, though, it was working.
46    She stepped out and knelt beside the coffin. Running her fingers along the edge, she found a catch. A panel flipped
47 open on top, revealing a series of colored lights and readouts. She studied the readouts for a moment, puzzled.
48    The 'coffin' was actually a stasis cell, used for holding people too dangerous to be left concious. That much she
49 knew. But the panel was for a cellular regenerator. it was healing the occupant while holding him. Somebody wanted him
50 in good shape when he arrived. What was going on here?
51    Nervously she manipulated the controls. This was something a little out of her expertese. Suddenly there was a
52 click and the lid of the stasis cell swung up. Bathed in the cold blue glow of the field was James. She looked at him,
53 her heart pounding. He seemed to be dead but the controls said he was quite alive. Relief washed over her, but only
54 for a moment. Their situation was still serious. She needed to get him out of this thing fast, before the warpship
55 reached its destination, which wouldn't be long.
56    She worked the controls, concious of the time. And of one other fact. Before opening the cell, she had seen the
57 registration tag on a crate beside it. Along with a bunch of pertinent but uninteresting information, it listed their
58 destination.

62    She could see the signs of life returning as the blue light faded.  Her
63 hand began to tremble while she initiated the final manuvers.
64    James began brreathing heavily.  It would be some time before he was fully
65 recovered.  And time was somthing they had very little of.  
66    He opened his eyes groggily, at first, then with a start, he jumped up.
67 His vision still blurred, he began turning franticly, reaching in all directions
68 in order toestablish some sort of orientation.
69    Tariyan said in a clear tone, "Please, calm down."
70    Her voice had a supernatural quality about it.  James found himself relaxing
71 effortlessly.  
72    James vision began to clear and he recognized his environment.  He knew
73 what the coffin was, and he knew what it meant to be in a cargo hold.     
74    "Where are they taking me?", he asked, even though he suspected the answer.
75    "Kaden.", Tarian answerd curtly.
76    "You know what they'll do to me there?",  James' face became desperate.
77    Tariyan nodded, "We haven't much time.",  she displayed an open palm, 
78 "Here take this...", a small grey sphere apeared in her hand.
79    James backed up a step in surprise.
80    "Quickly", her gaze was intense.
81    He had no choice, he felt himself reaching for the sphere.

83 Ah, friend Makeeson (I may call you friend, yes?), so sad to hear of Nicholas'
84 metamorphosis.  You seem to be as aware as ever, though, so an answer to your
85 presumably rhetorical (yet significant) question is 'around 90'.  New motivation
86 is in the works, though, so stay tuned.

93    The driver wrestled the jeep back up the slippery bank, and onto the runway, just as the Tri-Star lifted off.
94 The wheels spun on the wet grass, throwing back bits of mud, then jumped forward as the lugged tires bit 
95 into the hard surface, and raced toward the two figures who had arrived on the Lockheed.
96    The rain was falling hard now; fat drops spattering against the wind screen, and soon both men were soaked.
97 The passenger finally found his voice;" I've got to get to a radio. Fast."
98 "Right"; the driver answered. "To report the Lear being stolen, right? Soon as we pick up our new arrivals"
99    The jeep skidded to a halt just as they passed the canvas top, ripped loose by the departing Lear Jet.
100 "Well, get in" he barked at the strangers, and hopped out to retrieve the canvas cover.
101 The two men jumped in, looking suspiciously at Delta Five. just as the driver returned.
102 He plopped the wet canvas on the floorboard, and turned to look at his new passengers. His jaw dropped open.
103    "George! George Kellerman. Well I'll be go to hell..." "Lou, you old reprobate! Good to see you my friend"
104 George continued;"Say, a bit close, huh? What happened?" 
105 "Fella here had his Lear 24-B stolen. Damn near wiped us out! Say, never did catch your name"
106 "Eric", Delta Five replied, and resumed his silence.
107    As the jeep skidded to a stop, Delta leaped out and hurried inside. He went to the communications panel
108 and picked up the KingPhone. His finger jabbed at the keys, then he spoke rapidly. 
109 On the other end, the General listened intently. 
110 
111    The rest of the group hustled inside, chatting excitedly. George was saying;" It's this business about 
112 Pervis, Delta Five, and McKane...
113 At the same instant, Delta was ending his transmission;"..stolen 0300 Juneau, bomb aboard, suspect McKane..."
114 Then total silence. Delta Five and George Kellerman stood motionless, ashen faced, staring at each other...
115 Lou went to the frij and was passing out cans of Budweiser in the intense, embarrasing silence...
116 Finally Delta spoke;"In a little while we will have two visitors. ALL of us have something in common. We will have much 
117 He opened his attache case and removed a Black Nikon, and slung it over his shoulder. He sat down, and
118 cracked open the beer. "Gentlemen, it's going to be a long night..."
119 They sat there, in silence. The drone of a twin engine prop plane flying low overhead rattled the windows.
120 Lou muttered;"sounds like an Albatross Amphibian..."
121 No one heard him.
122 2500 miles to the south, two F4 Phantom fighters screamed along a runway, and up into the night sky...

142 FROM SOME DEVILISHLY CLEVER USER OF THIS SYSTEM WHO HAS NO BORDER AS YET
143     ALL: Lower case is a nice way to place emphasis on certain words or titles.
144 As with all all nice things about this language, it can be abused and if you
145 are only using lower case, you are abusing it, now aren't you?
146          It would be a fine thing if we all tried to use English as we are all
147 instructed to in at some point in our lives. So try it, you like it.

Setting a new bottle of ink onto the writing desk, the Sage sat down
152 to finishing one of his more important obligations.  The quill scratched the
153 whiteness of the pages, redness filled the scratches and in a matter of a
154 dozen minutes, the letter was written.  Still, there were more to be written
155 nd this made the Sage a little spritely.
156     Claiming that the letters required researching the nature of schooling,
157 the Sage went off to trail and discuss scholarship with the Odd One.  Who
158 once mentioned celebrating the birth of the Academic Year this Spring.
159 
    The Sage did not find the Odd One anywhere in the elaborate structures
160 of the estate.  Not even in the parlour where he had usually spent time in
161 the archives of Inisfal during the late evening.

166 DANM IT, SOME OF US(ME) ARE STUCK IN UPPER CASE!!! 
167  RIPPLE, MCCRUDO'S HAD EVERY SPARE MINUTE OF MINE THIS WEEK, IT'S BEEN HARD
168 TO FIND TIME TO GET ON.          
169 ALL: KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK ON THE STORIES, I THINK THE INN HAS PULLED OUT OF
170 THE DOLDRUMS. EVICTION NOTICE? HAH!
171 SNYDE: PLEASE LEARN ABOUT THE USE OF THE PERIOD, AND COMMA. YOUR SENTENCE BACK
172 THERE WAS EASILY THE LONGEST ON THE DISK. DON'T FEEL BAD, THOUGH, AS YOU WILL 
173 NOTICE, OTHERS HERE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. SPELLING HERE ALSO TAKES A BEATING.
174 MORRISSEY: IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY GUYS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN LONG TERM
175 RELATIONSHIPS, THEN THINK OF THIS. GUYS WHO ARE GOOD FOR LONG RELATIONSHIPS ARE
176 , IN ANY GIVEN TIME, INVOLVED IN THEM, OR GETTING OUT OR IN THEM. IN THE SAME 
177 PERIOD GUYS WHO ARE NOT DEDICATED ARE HAVING MANY RELATIONSHIPS. THEREFORE, 
178 STATISTICS FAVOR THE CHANCE THAT YOU WILL BE GOING OUT WITH THE PERSON WHO IS
179 UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A LONG RELATIONSHIP. YOUR BEST CHANCES FOR LONG TERM 
180 COMMITMENT(1TO2 YEARS) ARE WITH A GUY WHO HAS BROKEN UP WITH ANOTHER GIRL IN
181 WHICH HE WAS INVOLVED FOR A LONG TIME. UNFORTUNATLY, THOSE GUYS ARE THE LEAST 
182 LIKELY TO ASK WOMEN OUT, BECAUSE THEY USUALLY ARE GETTING OVER THEIR LAST LOVE!
183 IF SOMEONE DUMPS YOU AFTER A FEW DATES, COUNT YOURSELF LUCKY, YOU PROBABLY
184 WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN ALONG VERY WELL AFTER A FEW MONTHS OR SO.
185   
186   WELL, THATS MY TWO BITS, IT WILL NOW BE AMUSING AND INSTRUCTIVE TO WATCH
187 EVERYONE JUMP ON ME AND TELL ME HOW WRONG I AM.

189 JUMP JUMP YOU'RE WRONG YOU'RE WRONG. THERE. THAT DIN'T TAKE LONG. WHAT *IS*
190 A 1TED, ANYHOW? 
191 
192   At least Snyde toggled everyone from using lower case only to using upper
193 case only.  Not a switch really, because that implies things are better or
194 worse than they used to be.  This is still mundanity in inaction.

197 God, Here I go, 
198       There's an army of single woman out there----all of them beautiful, 
199 talented, intelligent, warm, and giving----just longing to meet a good man.
200 And there's an army of single men out there---all of them good-looking, 
201 talented, intelligent, warm, and giving. Everyone keeps telling me this.
202 And be advise, Keep telling yourself this. It'll keep you from snapping up
203 the first one to come around, without a second thought. As long as you think
204 your're in a buyer's market, it'll keep you confident, and that will keep you
205 selective. Just remember the philosophy that winners attract winners. And the
206 winners in the relationship game knows what he's (or she) about when searching
207 for a relationship. You know what you don't want----that's why you split. It's
208 harder to know what you do want. Most management experts will always tell you,
209 write it down! Get it on paper. That way, you can know what you're looking for.
210 And when you write it down---be specific.
211 Of course, Don't expect your candidate to satisfy every need; if they fill 
212 about 60 percent, there's a great chance for happiness. But try the list. It
213 works! You can compare the guys you meet against it and see what they have to
214 offer towards fulfilling your desires.
215      The reason that most first relationships fail is becouse we depict them
216 as if the were conceived in heaven. But it's becouse we're sexually anxious
217 and want to sleep with this person forever. We don't plan. But the second time
218 around works better becouse we plan better. You set goals and work toward them
219 If it sounds too regimental and unromantic, try it anyway---you can create 
220 your own fire and make the whole thing work.
221      The aforementioned are just a few criteria, observations, and comments
222 to help make the choosing of a mate, date, whatever you want to call it easer.
223 one morething that makes a relationship work: HONESTY. Without it, all the other
224 things aren't worth a damn.  So good luck.

331 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
332   Occasionally I di
333 (oops, ENTER ONLY strikes again) Occasionally I indulge myself and wax
334 philosophic.  Usually it happens when someone who is going through some 
335 of the same problems I faced a short time ago appeals for help.  Sometimes,
336 however, I wonder if my running on about it makes any sense to those involved
337 with the problems -- but what the hay, maybe we can start a discussion.
338   I find that male-female encounters are a strange mixture of instinct and
339 intellect.  There are powerful biological forces at work, often in opposition
340 to social forces.  Negotiating the hazards is tricky, especially if one likes
341 to complete the trip with their ego intact.
342   Perhaps others would like to join in -- share some of the thoughts about
343 this basic human activity.  I don't mean about the sex act itself, that is
344 not very interesting as a spectator sport, I'm interested in the hazards
345 of the encounter from either side.
346 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
347     Then there's always the pheremone and affection theories. Where lust and
348 love are inseperably confused in an life-long quest to find a parental
349 simulacrum, in every chance social meeting. And especially in the workplace.

359 Emu: No brother to speak of, just a different biological unit from a different
360 reality. As for piper's crack about 'equal', that was not the original intention
361 of the name as my previous major communicator on BW was 'tHE dROPPED bIT.' So I
362 went from dropping bits to dropping parity. But of course MY rationalizations
363 can be taken or left, and the final decision must rest with you. :-)

368     "Parity! I don't like this plane! Isn't an Albatross a big ungainly
369 unsightly bird that can barely fly? I mean just like this plane?"
370     "Why Fellows, I never knew you to be one scared of being up in the air.
371 This is a fine plane. Besides, we're almost to Juneau. Don't worry, nice
372 safe land is dead ahead."
373     "Don't say dead! I mean, er, this, well since I had those dreams, I have
374 had a little problem with my..."
375     "What dreams? The stuff you went to see Macrobius about? Fellows, come on,
376 be serious."
377     "I am serious Parity. We didn't get to finish our first appointment because
378 of the emergency call. Then we were whisked off to Alaska. And now we are
379 flying by the seats of our pants in a 40 year-old amphibian. And..."
380     "Calm down. I am sorry I did not realize how much your dreams had affected
381 you. Macrobius is good, very good, believe me. But you must shove those 
382 feelings out. We have a mission to do, and a man with a black FE2 to contact."
383     "I know, I know. Sorry to lay this stuff on you Parity, it's not your
384 problem."
385     "Bull. It is my problem because you are my friend. But we can't let it get
386 in the way now. The stakes are too high and too much is riding on what we do.
387 Believe me, when this is all over we'll get you back to Macrobius and take care
388 of everything."
389     "Thanks Parity."
390     "De rien. Now look up ahead, through the rain. See the lights? Juneau
391 International Airport."
392     "That?! More like Juneau county mudfield. Are you sure you can set this
393 thing down in this weather?"
394     "That's what I am counting on. See that lighted pier to the left? That's
395 the amphib dock. I'm putting us down over there."
396  
397     Parity set the big Albatross down in the water without incident. The plane
398 taxied over to the dock, where Fellows jumped from the aircraft's door to the
399 slippery wooden pier below. He quickly secured the plane to the dock rings
400 while Parity powered down the ancient but functional plane.
401  
402     "Nice landing Parity. I knew you could do it."
403     Parity chuckled. "Of course you did Fellows. Of course you did. Now let's
404 find a man with a camera. Black wasn't it?"
405     "What time is it? Did we beat the 0400 mark?"
406     "0358. Close enough. Let's head over to the garage-radio tower. Maybe
407 they have seen this Delphi character."
408     "Parity? Four in the morning and it's this light out. Sure ain't San
409 Francisco."
410     "Welcome to the land of the midnight sun, or almost."

415 Honesty is paramount. If you must avoid being honest with someone because you are afraid of their
416 reaction, they do not belong with you. You should be able to expose your inner-most feelings without
417 fear of retribution. You should be open and honest enough to allow them to do the same thing. 
418 Honesty goes both ways or it goes no where. When you fail to be honest you submit your reality to
419 the other person. When you fail to say what you really mean, is starts a cancer than can not be 
420 cured except with a large dose of honesty. Before all the questions of compatibility and personality
421 and acclimation; before all the other considerations that must be examined when building a long-term
422 relationship, you must know whether or not you can be honest with the other person. To start with,
423 nothing else matters. Seek out those who you can feel this way with and can feel this way with
424 you. They will be your best friends, your finest confidants, and your most compatible mates.

429 Yes, here is my stupid boarder for all of you worthless people to look at! I 
430 know that you will never be as good as me. You can always dream about it.
431 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
432 WELL, THAT LAST COMMENT WAS CERTAINLY INTERESTING. DID HE(OR SHE) MEAN BOARDER,
433 OR BORDER? I HOPE THAT MY MIND NEVER REACHES SUCH A FINELY TUNED STATE OF 
434 PERFECTION AS TO ENABLE ME TO MISSPELL THE SIMPLE WORD BORDER. AH, WELL.
435   MORRISSEY, LOOK AT ALL THE DISCUSSION YOU HAVE CAUSED! I KNEW THAT BWMS WAS
436 BACK ON RECOVERY! USUALLY YOU CANNOT GET SUCH GOOD DISCUSSION WITHOUT INSULTING
437 SOMEONE.   
438    I THINK THAT HONESTY MUST BE PUT IN PROPER PERSPECTIVE HERE. WHEN YOU ARE
439 FIRST GOING OUT WITH SOMEONE, OR TRYING TO IMPRESS THEM, YOU NEEDENT TELL THE 
440 TRUTH WHEN THEY ASK FOR A DETAILED OPINOON ON THEIR CHOICE OF ACTIVITY, OR
441  OPINIO 
442 
443 OPINION. IT'S THE OLD STORY OF DO YOU TELL THE PERSON A WHITE LIE OR NOT. AND,
444 EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN GOING OUT FOR A LONG TIME, IF YOU AND YOUR PARTNER ARE 
445 JOKING AROUND, OR PLAYING GAMES WITH EACH OTHER FOR FUN, THEN IT'S OK TO SLIP
446 IN A TALL TALE OR TOO. BUT WHEN THE SERIOUS TIME COMES THEN HONESTY IS I
447 INDEED IMPORTANT. I THINK THAT BEFORE A COUPLE CAN BECOME REALLY CLOSE, THEY 
448 MUST BE FRIENDS. AFTER ALL, A GIRLFRIEND (TO ME) IS JUST A FEMALE FRIEND WHO 
449 I AM CLOSE ENOUGH TO HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH. IMAGINE IT THIS WAY: IF YOU 
450 ARE GOING OUT WITH SOMEONE, THINK OF THEM, FOR A MOMENT, AS THE SAME SEX AS YOU
451 . THEN ASK YOURSELF; WOULD YOU STILL BE HANGING  AROUND THIS PERSON? IF THE 
452 ANSWER IS NO, THEN YOU MUST REALLY EVAULATE YOUR OPINIONS TOWARD THIS PERSON, 
453 AND INDEED TOWARD THE WHOLE AREA OF MALE-FEMALE RELATIONS. IF YOU WANT A BOY, 
454 OR GIRL, FRIEND JUST SO YOU CAN GO OUT WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS DIFFERENT PLUMBING
455 THEN YOU THEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF GROWING UP TO DO. MALE-FEMALE RELATIONS ARE NO
456 DIFFERENT THAN MALE-MALE, OR FEMALE-FEMALE RELATIONS. THE PROBLEM WITH MOST
457 PEOPLE IS THAT THEY HAVE SWALLOWED THE PAP THAT SOCIETY HAS TAUGHT THEM; NAMELY
458 THAT MEN AND WOMEN CAN'T DO THINGS WITH EACH OTHER WITHOUT SOME ELEMENT OF SEX 
459 INTRUDING. THE SEX PART OF A RELATIONSHIP IS ENORMOUS FUN. BUT, THAT'S JUST IT,
460 GOOD CLEAN FUN. IT IS NOT A SEPARATE RELATIONSHIP IN OF ITSELF.

481 All young lovers: I'm enjoying the "how to fall in love" discussion.  I found
482    my mate almost a year ago, and the wedding will be in September.  I can
483    attest to the statements about honesty, and maybe add something.  The single
484    (enter only... ch/single/two/) most important things between Vanessa and I
485    are our honesty with each other and our openness.  Not only must you be 
486    honest with someone, you must also be able to share your feelings.  If you
487    don't tell your companion that your ego was just bruised by something said,
488    he/she will never know, and may continue to unknowingly step on your
489    feelings.  If you let even little things go unsaid,  They will start to
490    pile up on you, little by little, until you can't stand waking up next to
491    this person, and you really won't know why.  Let the other know what you
492    are thinking, why you were hurt when he/she barked at you for leaving the
493    dirty dishes for the next day.  Also, if you don't know what the other is
494    thinking, by all means, ASK!!!
495        Earlier, someone asked why put your feelings on the line, just for them
496    to get stomped on?  Everything in life is a risk of some sort: you literally
497    cannot live without risk, and you won't accomplish *anything* if you refuse
498    to take a risk.  In finding someone to love, you must risk your own feelings
499    to let the other that you are interested in getting to know them better.  You
500    needn't tell them that you are fatally in love with them and will die with-
501    out their love; just start talking to them!  If you can find something to
502    talk about of interest to both, go talk about it over a glass of you favorite
503    beverage at your (or his/her) favorite restaurant; or go to a noon concert
504    or lecture together.  Vanessa and I started out going to a student produced
505    play at PSU.
506        Whatever you find to do with your new friend, be honest in your feelings
507    about what you do together and what you think about the world.  As someone
508    said in the above, be friends first.  If you can enjoy each other as *people*
509    first, then maybe the relationship can blossom into deeper levels of
510    closeness, affection, and if you're lucky, love.  Don't expect to go out
511    and say "I'm going to fall in love with HER."  Let love come to you.  You
512    may be pleasantly surprised.  I was.

570 Let's not be too hasty about telling various users to watch out for control
571 characters uploaded with their messages.  Sure, they may be inconvenient, but
572 can come in handy when you're trying to find out who really sent a message,
573 and whether the twits are active again.  F'rinstance, the new character
574 Morrissey occasionally puts in the same kind of control character that another
575 character (I can't remember his name, names actually) often did without 
576 realizing it.  He kept changing identities, but was continually unmasked 
577 because of embedded control characters.  He didn't even realize how he got
578 caught.  (This, I might add, was many months ago, possibly 10.)
579    Think of control characters like fingerprints.   Perhaps not quite unique,
580 but in this limited-use bbs, they can be useful.

589      I've just opened all the windows in the house.  Hopefully it will
590 air out all the ugly scents that fill this place.  Sure it'll get cold
591 in here, I expect that--maybe even desire it.  The cold is something I
592 have learned to get used to over the years.  Sadly, cold is natural.
593      Looking out my window I see the heart of the city, I could almost
594 reach  out and touch it.   The thought gives me a chill.   Right  now,
595 late at night, it reminds me of something I've often seen in the light
596 of  dawn,  yet during the day this vision is not possible.   The  city
597 lights  bathe  me with the notion that I am over the center of a  vast
598 web,  glisteneing with its everliving dew,  and I am but Arachne  over
599 her.   But dare I weave,  dare I compete with her natural beauty?  The
600 serenity of each glimmering fallen star resting in that web...   Oh to
601 glean the fallen stars!
602      I begin to quiver as I return to reality.   The nightshirt I wear
603 provides  little  guard  against the night's  elements.   I  rearrange
604 myself  on  the wide sill of the paneless  window,  hugging  my  knees
605 tightly  beneath  my  chin.   The illusion before me  though  slightly
606 splintered is still my hippodrome, and still my playground.
607      Rosaria, you've kept me well for a good portion of my life. There
608 is  little  you haven't shared with me,  and nary a  moment  have  you
609 spared a display of your temperments, hostile and benign alike.  Shall
610 I  now give you up to call another city my home?   Could I do that  in
611 order to be closer to the one that shares my sentiments?
612      Whatever I shall decide, you and moselle are my guests this eve.
613      Never should another be this lonely...
