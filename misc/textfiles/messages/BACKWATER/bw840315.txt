22 A new disk! a first for me.

24    Oh well, it looks as if we are off to see the wizard after all.
25 WOn a yellow brick road too! (6000 angstroms, funny.) Where has 
26 Dragonlady gone to? I see the Bard dragging along a loudly complianing
27 Fast Freddy. And the newly arrived Commander trying to figure out
28 a flintlock rifle. This group is really rather interesting.
29    Turning to the piper walking beside me I ask, "What do you plan
30 to do when we reach the wizard? Knowing a few tiny scraps of magic 
31 myself and knowing also what a real spellcaster can do. What do we
32 do if the wizard turns out to be rather hostile to a group of people
33 barging in on him?"

42 Yngvi, sitting back in the corner, looks out one of the tiny windows at the

44 the clatter of a horse-drawn cab on cobblestones.  This seems a might 
45 The two men, removing their fog-sodden capes, took places at a table as the
46 Innkeeper pushed a tea trolley up to the table.  "Good day, gentlemen.  And
47 welcome again to the Inn" said the host, "If there will be anything else, 
48 please ask."  The taller of the two, dressed in tweeds, thank him and then
49 turned to converse with his companian.
50 Yngvi turned back to his terminal thinking it was a rather slow sunday with
51 all the regulars off on a adventure.

54     After rowing the life boat ashore, the drink offered by the Piper was 
55 the next best thing to real Innwater. However, my rest was short; the Piper
56 wanted to move out.
57     "I seem to recall another way to the wizard's. I don't think we could 
58 fit this many people, but I would welcome any company."
59     With those words, I started off toward the wizard's stronghold.

65 Trav, you've got to get your eyes checked. The person stuck with babysitting duty is NOT the Bard, but li'l ol' me,
66 the Poet, I, La! And he's such wonderful good company that I wouldn't part with him for any sum of money...well...
67 maybe for a friend I could make an exception... how about 100 gold pieces and I throw in his leash for free?

70 My dear Mad Actor,
71    My heartfelt thanks for your welcome back on the flipside.  As it happens,
72 no, I am not using one of those battery-powered, lapsize jobs with an LCD
73 screen, but a full-size rigout.  Thus, your speculation as to who I am is
74 probably erroneous.  No matter.  When I took the peddlar's potion (in the
75 form of a number), I admit I didn't know what I was getting myself into.
76 Nevertheless, the BackWater bunch seem to be a delightful bunch of zanies,
77 and maybe their zaniness will be good for somebody like me.  In the meantime,
78 I ned to figure out how to do a satisfactory save on disk so I don't hog
79 time.  My ;first attempt was only partially successful.  (On the playback
80 offline, my word processor didn't like the reversed order of the CR/LF
81 sequence.  But not to worry.)  In the meantime, I'll just bide my time
82 and see where the yellow brick road leads to.  A little fantasy around the
83 edges might be good for me.

162   Moving like a schizophrenic amoeba, the party flowed left, right, north, and
163 south, but generally began to move along the road.  Suddenly the ninja announced
164 that he knew the way for them to travel.  With a sigh of relief, the piper
165 waved him to the forefront of the party.
166   It was a most pleasant and beautiful country the travellers found themselves
167 traversing.  Beautiful blue flowers nodded their dainty blue heads above the
168 blue grass.  Blue trees waved blue leaves in the scented breeze.  In fact, the
169 whole landscape seemed to be various shades of blue, the vibrant slash of 
170 yellow, the only relief from the monochromatic landscape.

173    "I resent that last comment", I snapped at the Poet.  Just because
174 I wanted to make a fast buck in Bolo's is no reason to make such

194     "Apprentice, I know some small amount of the arcane arts but as is

201 My dear friend Mohammed:
202 It is a sad day today, my friend, because I must bid you adieu.
203 I will miss our comraderie, but I am being urgently called a
204 away.
205 
206 The district attorney has discovered my involvement in the 
207 $42.2 million dollar Port of Portland coal export terminal 
208 swindle. By the time you read this message I will be in South 
209 America.
210 
211 I was certainly embarrassed when I discovered Cornelius Hutton 
212 was a guy in drag. I would have sworn he was a woman. He and 
213 Petrov went off somewhere together. I haven't seen them in days.
214 
215 Sorry about the crummy terrorist wisecrack. I didn't really    
216 mean it. I just wasn't myself that day. I'm sorry.
217                       Your dear friend

220 SALAZAR: BE WARNED! PREPARE YOURSELF FOR BETRAYAL FROM AN 
221 ALBANIAN ALLY. TREACHERY IS IN THE AIR. TRUST YOUR ENEMIES.

228 
229     The walk along in the sun is delightful, but this yellow
230 brick road business is a bit ridiculus, I was thinking to myself,
231 but I wish I knew more about the destination.
232     "Apprentice, could you tell me what you know about the wizard?
233 Just what can we expect from him?" I queried.
234 
235 
236     The hint on control characters works but it makes some messages
237 hard to read becase they are cluttered with t`e things. It depends
238 on which terminal program I am using weather I have troble or not, 
239 the easier program to use (the one with an auto dialing routine too)
240 does not convert control characters and some of those will dump me
241 or do strange things to my 80-column card (none of which are legible)
242 especailly control-Z sequeces, so could you please be careful of
243 alot of crazy contol chars. for everyones sake.
244 
245 Mike: for this last dump I put a delay between the characters being
246 sent and it helped 90% (I'm sure a longer delay would stop the last
247 couple things that got garbled) So if people are having trouble in
248 the future uploading stuff onto this system you might recommend this.

318 joined the motley bunch, I thought that there had been some semblance of
319 reason to their madness.  But now that we have been along the way for some
320 time, I have been thinking that the pipes need a bit of retuning, so that
321 we might be piped at least to a reality where even the madness has some
322 kind of inner coherence.  Really, people (?), we slab-sided types do
323 occasionally expect that even zanies eventually get to some sort of desti-
324 nation, as bizarre as it might be.  Of late, since I joined this ragtag,
325 it seems to be going nowhere all at the same time.  (Do you think that

407 The piper lifted a glass of ale.        The piper walked down the yellow brick
408 "How do we get out of this?" He asked   road.  A large green wall was visible
409 his companions.                         not too far away.

423 Dear Outsider:
424 
425 The easiest way to enter an adventure is to plunge in.
426 
427 There are a few unwritten rules that you won't be told until 
428 you break them. You will then be told in easy to understand 
429 language that you weren't supposed to do that.
430 
431 ON-LINE TIP: Sentences that begin something like "You stupip 
432 jerk, don't you know..." are possible indicators that you have 
433 violated one of the Backwater rules. Such rudeness seldom    
434 occurs during an adventure but when the discussion turns
435 serious watch out.
436 
437 There is only one thing you must absolutely never, under 
438 circumstances, ever forget. You must never forget that LeRoy 
439 McKane is your friend.
440 
441 LeRoy is out of town right now. He made of point of asking me 
442 to tell you that if you ever need help to let him know.   
443 Inspite of the lies about him that are spread by people 
444 jealous of his success, LeRoy is a really great guy.
445 
446 I bet everyone at Backwater would agree that LeRoy McKane    
447 takes care of his friends...not to mention his enemies.
448 
449                      Good Luck
450 
451                      Monsieur d'Autun

458 The bard made a few adjustments to a bracelet that he had removed from
459 his pack. "Here you go commander." 
460 The commander looked at it curiously, shrugged & fastened it on his wrist.
461 He then started to raise it to his }mouth. 
462 "That isn't necessary, just sub-vocalize", said the bard.

464 MIG: will disgcuss this later, maybe friday?

466 "I'm a am afraid that I do not really know very much about this wizard."
467 pausing, he turned to txhe ninja, "and Iif YOU pull a stunt like that again
468 I will see if I remember how to turn you into a frog!"

472  Man in Grey,
473 
474     If you refer to his " Hindmost " I most certainly have.
475 Perhaps one could add a bit of " Scrith " to this adventure.....even a 
476 dash of " Cziltang Brone " and a " Tasp " for good measure.
477

495 "I've had enough of this road," complained the ninja. I think I'll leave
496 you people to walk right in. Like I said before, I know a quicker way. 
497 If any of you want to come with me, welcome. All others can follow through
498 this demi-oz land.
499                  The Ninja
500 :**********************************************************:
501 JONATHAN CHANCE: Mr. McKane had to leave town suddenly and 
502 was unable to answer your message of a previous disc. He 
503 wishes me to inform you that he is no longer the employer of 
504 Mohammed Wassir and will not be held responsible for the 
505 abduction of PAM. Though Mr Wassir denies having kidnapped 
506 this charming, and popular, lady, I suggest that you might 
507 direct your search to Mr. Wassir's personal dungeon. If you 
508 do not find her there I can only recommend that you hire a 
509 detective. Do not make the mistake of hiring Lt. Salazar 
510 as he is one of Mr. Wassir's stooges. Monsieur d'Autun.

513 I STAGGERED A LITTLE AS THE SUDDEN REALITY SHIFTS
514 HAVE PROVEN MOST DIS-ORENITING. THE PIPER HAD
515 TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED AND WHERE WE WERE
516 BUT HIS WORDS SEEMED GARBLED AND INCOMPLETE.
517 BARD: THANKS FOR THIS "COMMUNICATOR". AFTER I AM
518 THROUGH WITH IT, CAN I TAKE IT APART TO SEE WHAT
519 MAKES IT WORK?
520 NOW FOR THE FLINTLOCK...
521 (SHIPS COMPUTER, ANSWER!)
522 (COMPUTER AY AY!)
523 (ALPHIE, HOW DO I USE A FLINTLOCK?)
524 AS ALPHIE DETAILS THE INSTRUCTIONS TO ME I CARRY
525 THEM OUT. FIRST THE POWDER, THEN THE WADDING 
526 UNDER THE BALL. TAMP IT DOWN. COCK THE RIFLE.
527 THERE! ALL READY TO GO. I CAREFULLY UNCOCK THE
528 RIFLE TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT, BUT NOW IT IS READY
529 TO FIRE IF NEEDED.
530 FAST FRED: DON'T PLAY INNOCENT WITH ME! THIS LEROY
531 FELLOW IS SOUNDING MORE AND MORE LIKE LESLIE.
532 IF YOU DON'T TELL ME HOW I CAN REACH HIM, I MAY
533 LOCK YOU UP UNTIL HE COMES ALONG! PLEASE BE 
534 REASONABLE, I JUST WANT TO ACCOMPLISH MY MISSION.
535 AS FOR DANGER TO ME, IF THE LIFE-CRYSTAL IMPLANTED
536 IN MY BODY DIES(ALONG WITH ME), MY SHIP WILL
537 KNOW SOMETHING WENT WRONG AND THAT LESLIE IS HERE.
538 WE WILL THEN HAVE THE TYPE OF INCEDENT WE ALL
539 WANT TO AVOID! SO TRY TO COOPERATE."
540 AS I SAY THIS I CASUALLY FIDDLE WITH THE FLINTLOCK
541 MAKING MY POINT PERFECTLY CLEAR.
542 EVEN IF NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO GO, PLEASE DIRECT ME
543 TO THE WIZARD A.S.A.P.! THANKS

548 Deborah: In response to your question, to upload is to send a file
549 to another sytem from your computer and to donload is to accept a
550 file from another computer. If I write a bunch of text, then logon
551 to this system and send that text in one big bunch, I am uploading
552 to this system. (well thats how I understand it anyway)
553 
554 Mike: I'm pretty sure that the problem is in the middle of lines, 
555 because my terminal software sends only one line at a time, waiting
556 for me to press a key between lines.

561 This is getting downright confusing, we are at the in and we are not
562 at the in, two realities at once. Well I guess we live in two realities
563 at a time, The real world (if it can be called that), and the rather
564 different reality that exists only in our minds and a computer somwhere
565 in S.E. portland. And just who slipped Freddy the reality pill?!!!
