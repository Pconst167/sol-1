68   The piper had not noticed the innkeeper place the extra drink by his
69 elbow, but the soft word caught his, rather muzzy, attention.  Looking 
70 down, the piper saw the small statuette, perfect in every detail, from 
71 the soft feathers ringing the fetlocks to the graceful sweep of t
72 wings.  Memories assulted his mind, the sweet smell of morning winds
73 sweeping into his face, the warm breath of the pegasus when she nuzzled
74 him awake on a far-distant adventure.  His face gave no sign of the stab
75 of pain that filled his heart, the pain that grew nearly beyond endurance.
76   The words were soft, automatic.  He did not even notice himself thanking
77 the innkeeper, as his eyes caressed the statuette.  His only feelings were
78 pain, pain and the deep sense of loss of the two things that in his
79 turbulent life he had cared deeply for.
80   The extra drink was welcome, wrapping the pain away from direct contact
81 as it were.  He rose and left the table, making his way out into the cold
82 and blustery night, avoiding the person hammering boards into the hole 
83 in the floor, ignoring the blast of icy air that swept into the inn to
84 set the candle flames adance and puffing smoke from the hearth blaze into
85 the already smoky atmosphere.  Braced against the beating of the wind,
86 he passed the lonely rowan tree and turned the corner of the heavy, 
87 low-set building, away from the yellow lamplight that illuminated the
88 heavy oak door.  The crescent of the new moon gave but little light to 
89 the shadows, the fingers of the wind sent icy chills up his legs under
90 the warm woolen folds of his kilt.  The relative warmth and calm of the
91 stables was welcome.  In the calm he kindled the small lantern and went
92 to the empty stall that had held the pegasus, ignoring the movement and
93 whickering of other steeds in the stable.
94   Searching the mouldering straw, he found three feathers, overlooked 
95 long before.  The tears traced icy trails down his cheeks as he leaned
96 on the stall partitions, mind filled with the graceful curve of great
97 wings bending into the wind, the soft curve of a beloved cheek outlined
98 against a grey cowl, the exhilaration of a swift descent, and th
99 gleam of steel as it bit into her bared breast.

107 Franklin Pervis through down the contents of the packet and looked up at Nick Young. Young just stared back at the
108 small man, noticing the large beads of sweat that were forming on his pudgy forehead.
109 "Well Mr. Young," said Pervis, interupting Young's examination of him. "I guess that's it. There's too much at stake
110 for me. You can investigate on your own if you want, but I'm out."
111 Young began to protest, but Pervis was out of his chair, ushering him out the door as he spoke. "I can't risk my life
112 over an expose' such as this. There are plenty of other Delta V's out there, and I can't pretend that exposing one 
113 would really make the world that much better." As he spoke the final words he nudged Young in the back and slammed the 
114 door behind him.
115 
116 He walked back to his desk, wiping his brow and shaking his head. Gathering up the letter, photograph and keys, he
117 shoved them into a new manila envelope, addressed it to his friend at Scotland Yard,  and placed it in his outgoing
118 pile. He knew the contents would be self-explanatory, and he hoped that they might somehow be of help to his friends
119 there.
120 
121 Jim Youngston was the editor of the "Daily Ditto," and was also  the closest friend Franklin Pervis had in the world.
122 He was deeply concerned by his friend standing in front of him,  chain smoking and sweating even more profusely than he
123 normally did.
124 
125 "Jim, you've got to understand. My reports will be coming in the mail to you from now on. I'm going underground."
126 
127 Youngston tried to protest, but Pervis rushed on. "I want you to go to my house and get a few things. Here, I've made
128 a list" Pervis through a small white note on the editor's desk. "This Delta V is good, but he's not perfect. He knows
129 a lot about me, but not everything."
130 
131 "You mean-?"
132 
133 "Right. That's why I kept their deaths secret from all but a few friends. You knew my wife and daughter had died in
134 that car crash, so I can trust you. Delta V didn't, and he's using them as a threat against me. But now that they're
135 gone, I have nothing to lose."
136 
137 "But why, Franklin, why do you want him so bad? Why risk your life like this?"
138 
139 Frankling Pervis took a long draw on his cigarette, and exhaled slowly. His glistening blue eyes stared directly into
140 his bosses, and his voice spoke with a steady sureness that belied Pervis' looks.
141 
142 "He killed my son."
143 
144 The next day, the Daily Ditto ran a feature article on the front page.

157 	Nick Young stared at the blank wall that stood adjacent from the 
158 	office of Franklin Pervis.  He had been ushered out of there in an
159 	unseemly fasion, and without much explination.  
160 		Pervis had said that he was going to hide, to try to escape fro
161 	any wrath he may have incurred of Delta V, saying that he was off
162 	this case.  But Nick didn't believe him.
163 		Pervis was too much of a reporter for to long to let a lead,
164 	however frail, go untangled.
165 		Nick knew, he had been following Pervis's writings for a 
166 	long time; that's why he came here in the first place.
167 		Well, if Pervis was giving him the brush-off for his own
168 	safety, then Pervis was highly out-of-character.  If instead he was
169 	generally afraid of Delta V or any of his cohorts, then he was down
170 	right crazy.
171 		Nick decided it was time to do some digging of his own...

174    James snapped out of his funk when the door opened again and Tariya peeked in. He put his personal problems away
175 for the moment and invited her in.
176    She wasn't wearing that old robe anymore. She had traded it for outfit of some blue material with white trim. A
177 waist-length cape was draped over the right shoulder with a silver connecting chain that ran under the other arm.
178 Unlike her robe, this outfit was rather close fitting and she filled it out very nicely indeed. "Whoa!" James gasped.
179 "You're beautiful."
180    She blushed a little and smiled shyly. "Thanks. But what was I before?"
181    James grinned, "By now you should know better than to hand me a straight line like that. C'mon over and have a seat
182 and a few last words with a dying man."
183    "You're not dying." She said as she sat on the edge of the bed.
184    A lot you know, he thought. "I heard you had a pretty rough time of it yourself. How are you feeling?"
185    "Fine. They released me days ago. I've been staying in a spare room at Willy's apartment."
186    "So I hear." James said sourly. "Been enjoying yourself?"
187    "Yes! This city is magnificent! Does it really cover the entire planet?"
188    "That wasn't what I meant but yeah, it does. It's a dimensional Junction. Dangerous place, though. I think you'd
189 wanna be careful."
190    "You sound like you still care." She said quietly. "I don't know why, after all the trouble I've been."
191    "I don't either. You've been a royal pain in the ass since I picked you up." He regretted the words as soon as they
192 came out. Why did he have to say that?
193    Her voice was tight, barely controlled. "Well, I don't think I'll cause you any more problems. I'm staying
194 here."
195    James felt his heart lurch. Way to go, stupid. He needed his mouth punched. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like
196 that."
197    After a long, sullen silence, she finally said, "I think you mean more than you know." After another long moment,
198 she started laughing. "But you're right." and they both broke up laughing. After regaining her composure, she turned a
199 little more solemn. "And that's why I'm staying. I'm too much of a liability."
200    He was going to argue the point, but later. He really wasn't up to it right now. Instead, he said, "How about
201 answering me a question?"
202    "Depends on the question."
203    "Nothing too personal, I hope. I just wondered if you'd tell me who you are?"

239 Scotland Yard Internal Memo
240 Fm : Intelligence Team
241 To : Internal Affairs
242 
243      Due to our involvement with the Delta V case as per the request
244 for services from M5, we have been required to request additional
245 help on the case. The I.T. has deemed fit to notify NET (refer prev
246 memo) on this matter, due to their prior experience with Delta
247 class agents. Last week NET responded to our request by allocating
248 two field agents to the case. The agents are due to arrive in London
249 in the next two days. Their flight is being kept a secret as a
250 security precaution. I.A. will coordinate plan DESPOIL DELTA with
251 the two NET agents on their arrival. I.T. has had two S.Y. men
252 in Delta V's general location since last week. It should be noted
253 that a tabloid newspaper has become embroiled in the Delta V affair,
254 but I.T. sees no adverse affects from the publicity yet. Rupert
255 Murdock has been informed that given word from us he can buy out 
256 the paper and in effect strangle the story.
257      Memo next: Arrival of NET agents.

276    The sounds of early morning in the city awakened him. Garbage trucks making their rackety rounds, divers blowing horns 
277 for whatever reasons...No birds chirping, he reflected. Time to get going. He turned on the model 100 and pressed a function
278 key. It was still connected. No one had disturbed the thin wires snaking down the hall of the cheap hotel, to the B box, where
279 he had tied into the managers private line. The manager was dead drunk, no doubt, at 5:30 AM, and it was tea time in London.
280 He punched in the numbers, and in a few seconds, the screen read "carrier detected, enter Delta code". He typed in the numbers
281 and his message, and then dialed a local number, and left another message. One not likely to appear on the front page of the
282 Daily Ditto. He had left Switzerland in too much of a hurry to withdraw funds from the CreditSuisseBanke, and was down to 
283 $7000.00 cash. He cleaned the Walther, and slipped out onto the street. Breakfast at McDonalds on 144th. He fit in with the
284 crowd. Finishing his fare, he double checked his list- Reversible jacket,five pound hammer,firecrackers,package of unfiltered
285 cigarettes in crushproof box,brown wrapping paper, stamps,masking tape, and two cans of aerosal packaging foam.
286    He caught the subway at 132nd, and got off in downtown Manhattan.He rented a postoffice box, and made enquiries at the 
287 tax assesors office and New York County registrars office, and then caught the #85 bus to 59th street, and walked across the
288 bridge to Brooklyn, where he looked up an old friend...
289 Walking back across the 59th Street bridge, he reflected upon something from "The Manual"-something that had been drummed 
290 into his head at Quantico:"when an experienced agent goes underground, the chances of finding him are precious little". 
291 Delta Five was ready.

370            HELP!!
371      Tonight I discovered that I had suffered a disk crash some time ago, damaging several writing files. These files
372 had not been backed up, and I didn't discover the damage until I belatedly attempted to back up the files. I used a
373 disk repair program and found that the damaged files had been partially written over, making the data totally
374 unretrievable by any mortal means. Among these files was the first half of the story "Phantom 429". Chapters 3,4,5, and
375 6 are lost to me forever. Hopefully this isn't completely true.
376      It is my understanding that a number of you out there archive the writings on this board. If anybody has copies of
377 the missing chapters on disk as transferrable text files and would be willing to upload them to me I would be
378 infinitely grateful. As I live with my parents I cannot give out my phone number but if someone is willing to help me
379 they can reach me through private mail on the following boards: Noname, Cary Grant, Project Rubicon, Computer Widowers,
380 The Bullet, Saigon, and Shotgun Fido. I check these boards daily.
381      I really hope someone is willing to help as I cannot recreate these chapters verbatim. Granted, they need
382 rewriting anyway, but I still want to have them for my personal archives.
383      Thank you in advance for any help.

388   The cold air was clearing the piper's head.  The comparitive warmth of the
389 stable had delayed the process, whil the activity of searching the empty
390 stall had hastened it.  He was approaching sobriety, took a good look at
391 himself, and was disgusted at what he saw.
392   A maudlin drunk, wallowing in self-pity!  "OK, fella," he thought.
393 "You've lost everything, huh?  So what makes you so special?"
394   A slight draught chilled the trails of the tears that had run down his
395 cheeks, tracing icy lines that seemed to etch the bones with cold.
396   "You've lost Aedem?  You never had more than a brief time with her.
397 You never told her how you felt.  You love her?  You should be happy;
398 she's going home -- back to her children, back to her ..."
399   The thought of her --husband -- was like a knife turning in the piper's
400 heart.  He slammed one fist into the rough-sawn board of the stall top,
401 driving splinters deep into the split knuckes, counteracting the emotional
402 pain with physical pain.
403   No!  He thrust the thought of that slim, grey-robed form that his arms
404 ached to hold, being embraced by another.  He should be concerned only for
405 her happiness, her welfare.  But, DAMMIT, it hurt!  Fresh tears trailed
406 fire down the ice trails marking his cheeks.
407   He blew out the lamp and walked out into the clearness of the icy night
408 and looked up at the audience of stars who gazed back with twinkling 
409 unconcern.  Ignoring the cold wind he looked into infinity, wondering
410 where she was now, how her quest progressed.
411 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

456 13 Dec.   My Dearest Harold, Oh thank you darling for such a lovely gift. It will fit perfectly in
457 the corner where the rubber plant was. The bird was delicious!. I can't wait till you return from your
458 sales trip, you yummikins man. All my love,Michelle.
459 14 Dec. My dearest Harold, Oh you shouldn't have. They're lovely,and I just adore their cooing sounds.
460 You wonderful man, hurry home!. All my love, Michelle. PS-the delivery man brought another tree
461 I guess I'll put it by the front door.
462 
463 15 Dec. Dearest Harold, Oh you don't have to be so generous, you charmer, you. Mother and I had them 
464 for dinner last night. Honey, the guy brought another tree, and more birds too, by mistake.
465 Hurry home! All my love, Michelle.
466 
467 16 Dec. Dearest Harold, I think there might be a computer 'fowl' up, the guy brought 4 lovely  
468 birds, they sing so sweet, but he's still bringing trees and more birds. Could you lok into this?
469 Mother says hi. All my love, Michelle.
470 
471 17 Dec. My Darling Harold, Oh my God, they're beautiful. You must have made big sales to
472 afford such extravagant jewellery. Oh I love you, you wonderful man. By the way, that guy is still
473 bringing more trees and birds, and it's getting a little noisy. All my love, Michelle.
474 
475 18 Dec. Dearest Harold, Please hurry home and take care of this problem, that delivery guy- he brought
476 another tree, more birds, and not 6 geese. The honking is making it hard to sleep, the birds are
477 starting to quarrel, and mother is getting very irritable. My love, Michelle.
478 
479 19 Dec. Dearest Harold. Please come home. Now we have Swans. What do I want with swans? There's
480 no place for them to swim. I know it's not your fault, but it's getting a little wierd around
481 here
482 Love, Michelle.
483 
484 20 Dec. Dear Harold. For god sake, come home. Now. This morning, a truck arrived, and now there are
485 
486 all these cows in the back yard, and girls running around carrying buckets. The neighbore are giving
487 me dirty looks, mother is back on Valium again and I can't sleep at all. Love, Michelle.
488 
489 21 Dec. Dear Harold. What am I going to do? There are these women prancing around in the front yard
490                                                 
491 the living room is full of bird cages, the back yard is littered with cow pies, and the Geese
492 are fighting with th Swans. The noise is really terible, the neighbore are complaining, and
493 the police have been driving by a lot. Mother has moved out, and I'm exhausted. Love, Michelle
494 
495 22 Dec. Harold. This has got to stop,dammit. There are these guys in costumes in the front yard, and
496 they're more than a little friendly to the women who were dancing. Most of the birds got loose and
497 are flying all over the place. The carpet is
498 ruined, the cows are eating the neighbor's
499 grass,and they're threatening to shoot them. The police have told me to get rid of the cows, or
500 be arrested. Come home NOW. Michelle
501 
502 23 Dec. Harold. Ok, you SOB, that's it. If it wasn't bad enough, now there are these wierdos in the
503 front yard, playing bagpipes, and the noise is deafening. The back yard is knee deep with cow
504 dung,and the house is a shambles. The health department has threatened to condemn it.
505 The maids, and the guys with the drums are fornicating everywhere and the dead Geese that
506 the cows stepped on are starting to stink. And you did it on purpose too, you bastard. I hate you.
507 Don't you ever come home.Michelle Warren.

555      Hi there guys!!  I don't know if anyone around the Inn will remember me,
556 as I made a hasty escape into the wilds of Reno, NV six months ago to find 
557 gainful employment and have only now gotten the financial stability to return
558 to our fair state and go back to Moo U.  I see that a lot of the old voices 
559 are silent, but a lot of new ones have found sanctuary here. I also notice
560 that a lot of people areleaving lines but no messages...is there a reason for 
561 this?
562      One quick question... there was a nasty rumour in Reno that the BBC has
563 cancelled our Beloved Doctor Who, and as I was not in touch with any sources
564 down there, I was unable to find out the Truth.  Is it all a load of poppy-
565 cock(insert your favorite adjective here), or is it (gasp) true????  If no
566 one knows, I'll have to go to powell's and get a copy of DW monthly...
