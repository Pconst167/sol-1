 20 Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: If three things might happen, one of
 21 them probably will. If it doesn't, then one of the other two might. But if
 22 not even this one does, then it's all on the last one. In the event of this
 23 last one not happening, which it might not, the experiment is best
 24 abandoned. A judicious application of this principle will explain, among
 25 other things, the rise of capitalism and why women take so long to get dressed.

131 Britania this is MY boarder! YOU stole it from me! As for black spot in hot
132 tubs I think it is a reaction from the heat and chlorine. It happened to my
133 partents tub and the "Hot Tub Guy" said it happens because we use Chorline that
134 is solid little chunks. He said we should switch to liquid chlorine instead.

231 Ah, a New Year's Day and a BRIGHT sunny morning to start it. Those of us who 
232 started the day with a wonderful 50 psi hangover in our brains (at about 3:30pm
233 or so in the evening) probably didn't appreciate as much but WTF. However, 
234 there is a solution...
235  
236         Dr. Seltzer's Hangover Helper!
237                    For relief
238               of headache, fatigue
239             heartburn, itching teeth
240           burning eyes and generalized
241                   aches & pains
242            associated with a hangover.
243  
244 Gneral Contants:
245           Calcium carbonite 840 mg.
246           Thiamine 250 mg.
247           Aspirin 450 mg.
248           Acetaminophen 288 mg.
249           Caffeine 64 mg.
250  
251      This should help in those wonderous situations when you cant stand at a 45
252 degree without getting air sick. Otherwise grap a Sazerac Cocktail, (Or a 
253 picher full in more extreme cases,) and try to relax.

269 Note to 01:  L5 is only slightly less secure than crypt.  Note Crypt
270 Breaker's Workbench for one.
271 Rcrypt?  What's that?  I'd use confide and then run it through btoa to
272 make it suitable for mailing.
273 On second thought, if messages were passed to/from UN*X systems only,
274 then cat file | compress | crypt | btoa | mail is highly secure.  Once the
275 file is compressed crypt produces much tougher to break encryption.
276 On the other end, cat ciphertext | atob | crypt | uncompress > plaintext.

301 tub is. But I think it also happened to my mom's hot also and that's in Oregon
302 but she didn't seem to care much about the spots so she didn't talk to anyone.
303 Have you asked anyone around this area? I have some friends that run Cal Spa's
304 in Clackamas, they might know. TO BRITTANIA: Nyahhh!!! to you too! It is YOUR
305 boarder that is backward, or may it's just you! HA HA HA! Anyway it was MY 
306 boarder FIRST! So Nyahhh!

327 3cpu's phone number is 246-xxxx. This board is a little different than the 
328 average BBS. It is set up with different rooms and you can travel through each
329 room. Every room is a different topic like "Programing" or "Downhill Skiing" 
330 but there are alot more than that! I heard they can have a max of 64 rooms but
331 I could be wrong! I just started a room thier called "THE BAR" were the

389 "Your momma wears combat boots?"  Nice rebuttal, that.  It reminds me of a
390 time in London when I witnessed the Fiftieth Annual Professional Debate
391 Tourney.  The winning arguement had the same distinct elegance that your
392 arguement simply oozes; it was "Oh, yeah?  Well, you're just stupid.  Pinhead."
393 This was by the visiting American team of Dewey, Cheetum, and Howe, the
394 U.S. National Debate champions.
395    That afternoon I returned to the old Inn and witnessed a similiar debate
396 which rapidly escalated to a form of arguement called a "boarder war".  As I
397 recall it solved nothing, hurt some feelings, and wasted a lot of disk space.
398 Generally two things happen when more than one person claims a boarder: 1)
399 the person who used it first has rights to it, and the second finds another
400 boarder to replace his/her own.  2)  Neither party cares, in which case they
401 both continue using it but mark it in a way that still identifies it as
402 their own.
403    These are not laws, but merely suggestions that have kept peace in the
404 past, perhaps they still apply?

409 Interesting....
410      Those of you who have been keeping track of the BWII system
411 date and time probably have noticed that it has not been correct
412 for some time.  I've been having trouble with it. I couldn't set
413 the clock. Everytime I would try the system would blow up. I don't
414 know why. Anyway, I tryed looking at it with debug, but debug has
415 some problems with some of the code and I couldn't get very far.
416 Seems that debug doesn't know how to deal with a direct to memory
417 push/pop from the stack. Anyway, out of shear frustration I decided 
418 to try replacing the 8088. The one in there was a NEC 8088. The one 
419 I put in its place was an Intel part. Guess what? Now everything
420 works fine.

469      The halls of stately giants, green furred with life, had become to Lojos a
470 static colaage as the caravan rolled ever onward.  The approaching clearing was
471 a welcome chaange of sceen.
472      There would be no stopping here though the bard realized as he chewed 
473 thoughtfully on a joint of roast beast. 
474      The others, all save the cook were sleeping so as to be alert when there 
475 turn came to releave the helm.  
476      "looks like we've got trouble" Bivul said to him as he reached for the
477 signal chord that would alert the cook and awaiken the others.
478      They approached the meadow from a slight rise.  A barrior, looking for all
479 the world like a solid stone wall obstructed not only the road but appeared to 
480 have been built accross the entire meadow.  The slight defferance in elevaation
481 hd concealed it until they reached the point of actual ddecent.
482     Fortunatly thair pace had been unhurried and they had seen the obstruction 
483 in time.  They had plenty of room to come to a 'safe' stop.  But then what?
484      One of the dissadvantages of the multi-wagon carrivan in a tactical 
485 situation was that it could not be readily turned about in the width of any 
486 reasonable roadway.  The best chance would be to pull the pin connecting the
487 trailers then turn the lead wagon around and get the hell out of there, 
488 abondoning the rest of the train to wwhat ever fate awaited it.
489      This still left one ore two minor difficulties.  Someone would have to 
490 physicaly lean out the back of the powered wagon, an exposed and vulnerable 
491 possition.
492      That was the drill every merchanter carrivan that had made it back from an
493 encounter alive had rehersed to a fine edge.
494      Derath who was both cook and one of the alternate drivers, as soon as
495 speed staarted slackening simultanios with the bell chord having been pulled, 
496 knew what was required.  To hesitate while the others roused would be to throw
497 away all.
498      Leaning out to pull that pin, he was the first to be lost.  Not, however,
499 before spending his lastt to finnish the job.
500     As the carrivan emerged from the trees, so did thair attackers.
501     Small men they were, wearing little more then fantastic spiral patterns of
502 purple die.  They rode great death hounds and rained forth a storm of arrows.

624 I notice in InfoWorld mention that the TRS-80 Model 4 running 
625 TRS-DOS v6.02 would no longer boot as of January 1st 1988. 
626 Acording to the article it doesn't recognize any year past 1987. 
627 Seems it looks at the system clock on boot up and if it doesn't 
628 like the year it won't boot. Interesting little bug if true.

649 True that TRSDOS won't boot accept a 1988 date.  It'll do just fine if you
650 don't bother to set the date.  (There's a revised version that fixes the
651 bug.)  By the way, if anybody has a Model 4 they want to unload, I'd be
652 glad to take it off your hands for you.
653  
654 Why the negative attitude?  Mostly to be different.  And partially because
655 I'd rather be pleasantly than unpleasantly surprised.  I don't think I

674 Ah, yes the TRSDOS 6.2 (and LDOS 5.1.3) "date bug". When they expanded the date
675 and time info stored in the directory (originally it only stored month/year!)
676 they were a bit crowded, so some brilliant person came up with a scheme that
677 coded the year in into 3 bits... So it only knows about years in the 1980-87
678 range. 
679 The fixed version uses up space intended for the update password, meaning
680 that you no longer can have both a user password anad a maintenance password.
681 <sigh>...
682 I'd just as soon find out where it stores the "80" that is added to the year 
683 and zap it to 88.

730      There's a cancer eating away at America, and I wan't to make sure everyone
731 knows what it is. By now you've all heard too much about the PMRC - Those
732 Washington Wives who seem intent on turning this country into a facist state.
733 But there's more to tell, and it's important. Have any of you noticed that 
734 Albert Gore, the husband of Tipper Gore, the lady who's the head of the PMRC, 
735 is now running for President? How do you feel about a guy who seems intent on 
736 doing away with Rock-n-Roll sitting in the White House? Kinda makes you hope t
737 that 'ol Gary Hart can keep from getting horny long enough to run.
738      If you don't believe me when I say there's a connection between the PMRC &
739 Albert Gore running for President, just call the PMRC's phone number in 
740 Washington, DC. You might be surprised to find the person anwering the phone 
741 saying "Gore for President, headquarters." The truth is that Tipper used her 
742 crusade against Metal and Rock bands as a springboard for her husband's 
743 presidential bid. To me, Rock-n-Roll has always been something more than a tool
744 for politicians to use to attract attention to themselves.
745      One of the things that has me really pissed off is that she (Tipper) used
746 copyrighted material without the different band's permission in her book 
747 "Bringing Up Kids In An Rated Society." She never even asked for permission. 
748 Luckily for her nobody got steamed enough to sue her. Hopefully she'll come out
749 soon from behind her husband and take on the on going debates head on. She just
750 can't be the totalitarian preacher she want's to be. She's a fundamentalist, 
751 just like Oral Roberts and all those other television evangelists who want to 
752 save your souls - FOR A PRICE. Hey Tipper, what's YOUR price?
753       Unfortunately, fundamentalists only see life one way - their way. If 
754 something doesn't fit into their vary narrow view of right and wrong, they
755 condemn it as wrong. I'm just waiting for the day when Tipper comes out and 
756 calls Rock-n-Roll satanic. She's come awful close at times. But maybe she's too
757 smart for that. With her husband running for president, she's probably white 
758 washed her opinions, making them seem very safe and positive. But I'm one guy 
759 who still thinks that censorship in any form is not only wrong, it's unamerican
760 ! 
761      I'm sure by now some of you are wondering what all this has to do with you
762 ? The fact is that it has a lot to do with everyone. If people like Tipper Gore
763 come to power, we can not only kiss off Rock-n-Roll, but a lot of other import-
764 ant things as well. Those people want to ban schoolbooks that discuss evolution
765 . They want to set us back to the Dark Ages. If we sit around and think they
766 can't do it, they may just surprise us. I'm sure that people in Germany, before
767 Hitler cam to power, didn't think a small group of fanatics could do them any 
768 damage either. We can't forget the lessons of history - though people like the 
769 PMRC would probably prefer we didn't read history books.
770      Some of you may be wondering why I'm bringing all this up now. For a long 
771 time I was like everyone else; I heard about the PMRC and just assumed they 
772 would go away as soon as Tipper and her friends found something better to do 
773 with their time. Now I see the whole sinister plot in action. With Albert Gore 
774 now running for president, I realized I couldn't keep quiet any longer - the 
775 situation wasn't going to go away. If anything ti was gonna get worse.
776      I realized that if I kept my mouth shut, by the time my band got itself 
777 together to go out and start playing some serious gigs, no place in the whole 
778 country would book us (or anyone else). They'd be afraid that some Governmental
779 agency would give them a hard time if they dealt with a Rock-n-Roll band. It's 
780 still not too late to do something about it, so I'm speaking up, and I hope you
781 do the same.

841  
842 ALL!,
843      For the sake of information, this anti-rock campaign started when Tipper 
844 Gore was passing her Daughter's room and heard her playing WASP's "Animal, ....
845 Like a Beast". How she got the song I don't know. At that time the song wasn't 
846 released on any American albums or as a single. But ever since then Metal and 
847 WASP in particular (I'm not too fond of the group but I do like a couple of 
848 their tunes.) has been a primary target for Tipper and the PMRC. I guess she 
849 feels we're (I'm a musician too, so that's why I'm so heavy into this!) 
850 corrupting her daughter's morals. Maybe if Tipper really thought about it, she
851 would have realized that her daughter was telling her something - "Even good 
852 families like Rock-n-Roll. It's just too bad that Tipper's bible is stuffed so
853 far down in her ears that she couldn't hear what her own daughter was telling 
854 her.
855  
856 L.B.
857     Theories were made to be broken. (heh heh).
858

871 to think of thereof.  The only way i can see life as being itself something
872 to find dissapointment in is that it might fail to live up (or down) to some-
873 one's expectations but is that realy a failure of life?  or is it more a short-
874 comming of having expectations?  you might be amazed how truely much more
875 pleasant it can be without them!    off course life is also sort of addictive 
876 but thats maybe another question.  As is extance.
877    minerals certainly exist.  it is aggreed by many they do not live as such.
878 pet rocks or no.  it is also quit possible that our awairnesses have an 
879 existance quiet seperate aand in no way dependent upon 'life'.

881      might as whell move on tword the end of what is so far written...
882      Bivul leaned back toward thair enimies around one side of the unit, Lojoce
883 the other, both spitting blow darts for all they were worth.  Lojoce achieved 
884 little resault but Bivul's stings found good effect.
885      By now Cymchal, one of the alternate drivers had arrived squerming through
886 the pass-back, more naked than not.  He took the yiller.  Bivuul's aim, now 
887 freed of the distraction of driving, became truely devistating.  From the rear
888 Lamshal, the other hunter, brought his archery to bear,
889     Soon lojoce's flank was in somewhat better order.  Only Nelutha the healer 
890 remained out of action.  This due more from a shortage of positons to fire from
891 than any tradition or reluctance on her part.
892     Cymchal had gotten them turned around and it looked like they were going to
893 be able to win clear when a winged one appeared in the sky, not that anyone was
894 noticing.
895     That was when the motion box broke loose and they where without power.  
896 Somehow one of the attacking elandar had managed to insinuate himself among
897 the wagon's undercarrage and Goddess only knows where he could have gotten
898 that wrench, let alone the knowledge to use it.
899      The stunt had almost certainly cost its performer his life.  Point was, it
900 would now almost certainly take thair's.
