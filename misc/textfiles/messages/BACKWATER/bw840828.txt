20 Ah, good, the dreamers have wandered off, and the arguers are back.
21 Read the a&b disks yesterday, but they were full so I couldn't slip
22 in any snide comments, and now it seems that both are gone, and a new 
23 one has taken their place. ?What has passed by in between?
24 
25 It wasn't the telephone system in Hawaii that died from the Bikini 
26 tests, it was the streetlights. EMP may be able to zap solidstate 
27 electronics directly, but the major effect is to cause huge induced
28 surges on the power lines. Anything attached to the AC power lines
29 can be zapped by EMP, or it can be connected to any long wires at all,
30 like aboveground phone lines. CB antennas are too short to worry about,
31 if it gets this, you're dead anyway from the blast.
32 As to how it works, a nuke above the atmosphere sends out a lot of ions
33 and electrons, which travel at different speeds, and when they hit the
34 ionosphere (heavyside layer) push it around. This large moving charge is
35 called electrical current, and creates a magnetic pulse. The wavelength
36 is long, but the pulse is fast, so high freqs exist. A big nuke has a
37 very sharp, powerful, but not very long ranging effect by itself, but
38 this is of interest only to heavily shielded military installations
39 because only they are around long enough to care. The high burst is
40 probably able to zap most of the US's power systems, and take out just
41 about anything connected to it on the way. The phone system would go,
42 too, because it is powered from AC. (Surge proctection is already in
43 the phone lines because of lightning, etc., and the smaller wire used
44 offers some attenuation, but don't be holding a phone during a nuclear
45 attack.) Even if your equipment is shielded, it will get it from the AC
46 line. Battery powered things are probably safe, unless connected to long
47 wires.
48 
49 I also like the "none of the above", especially if it neans "never, ever
50 again." However NOTA is not enough, politics runs on power, not opinion,
51 so it is not an effective vote unless nearly a majority.
52 Casting a vote for a noncandidate may feel good, or even seem like a good
53 idea, but is ineffectual. It is a way of saying something, but like all
54 communication, what is said and what is heard is not always the same.
55 If the person to whom you are trying to say something can't understand
56 you, you aren't talking, you're babbling, and who listens to a babbling
57 idiot? You have to say your message so that it will be understood.
58 To a politico, this means you must vote for someone with some chance of
59 winning, or at least who will get a large portion of the vote. That is to
60 say, will have power. No one else counts. Don't let your pride get in 
61 the way of your head.
62 
63 Enough stale politics, here's another point to ponder, or even argue 
64 about: in a society, many things an individual does affects others, so
65 it is correct for the society as a whole to declare rules about behavior.
66 The passage of information can both help and hurt citizens, so the means
67 of passing information must be controlled. Electronic bulletin boards,
68 like BWMS, or CBBS, are an especially dangerous example because they
69 are uncontrolled and fast. Laws should exist to properly regulate them,
70 and government agencies should be empowered to enforce these laws, lest
71 they be abused to the detriment of society. They may be so dangerous they
72 should be banned altogether.

82 The reference was to the classical Rhetoricians statement to the
83 pure logician.  If everything I say is a lie, then this is a lie also,
84 which means that everything I say cannot be a lie.  That confouded
85 the logicians because they thought in terms of either or, and not
86 shades of gray. (or grey, if you prefer MiG)  The correct solution
87 to that particular dilemma was the simple fact that that statement was
88 false, ie, not everything that I say is necessarily a lie.
89 
90 I am, however, equivocating.  The answer to your question is yes.  Laz
91 believes everything he writes.  If you have read Illusions, you will
92 remember a statement therein-
93   "Try to live your life so as to never be ashamed of anything that is

99 And our Democratic VP Candidate did not want to disclose her
100 financial position because:
101    A)  She is rich, and the Demo's are supposed to hate the rich.
102    B)  She owes a bundle in back taxes, which the Demo's are saying the
103        rich always get away with.
104    C)  Her husband illegaly borrows money from estates he is supposed 
105        to be disbursing honestly.

118 L'homme,
119         Well this lull was being called the " pause that refreshes " .....But
120 it seems to have become the " refreshless pause ". This low volume wallowing 
121 has become a market habit recently. I still feel there are good prospects 
122 for a rise in the not to distant future....provided it starts within the 
123 next 60 days or so...after then the managers start looking at locking in their
124 profit before year end and are reluctant to provide any stimulus. Except in 
125 the face of something overwhelming & unexpected.  
126         My views on future economic prosperity......are colored by the almost
127 opaque tint of " DEFICIT ". We bought ourselves out of the recession and its 
128 time we started paying for it !. Weather it takes the form of higher taxes 
129 (YUCK), decreased spending or any of the more creative combinations, the 
130 payments must start. Both parties seem to agree on that so at least the 
131 first steps towards a solution have been taken. All that remains is what
132 form the repayment will take. It is interesting to note the encouragement
133 of foreign investment.....As Americans and residents we can only hold 
134 government obligations in registered form....Foreign non-residents can hold
135 the same securitys in bearer form. This disconcerting double standard due to 
136 take effect at the first of the year. I should note that currently there are
137 a few bills in congress to outlaw that policy....But back to the economy... 
138         In total I feel the solution to the deficit is well within our power 
139 to correct...and will be done so in the forseeable future. If I was to 
140 characterize the single greatest threat to the economy it would be Third 
141 World debt. That is a problem that defies a cheap solution !. 
142 I know...I have heard all the jokes about repossesion and auctions...
143 but there has yet to be a solid move to address the growing problem. 
144 As it stands now it is just a patchwork quilt of borrowing facilities,
145 debt reschedulement and interm financing. Even in some cases the suspension
146 of accruing interest...so that the lending institution won't be forced to 
147 classify the loan ! ! . If you wanted a topic with a lot of facets this 
148 would be it !. I have most of the pertinant datum around here....somewhere....
149 As to who lent who how much and at what rate..if I remember correctly the 
150 figures are astonishing somewhere in the 220-250 billion range...or as
151 percentage of the total assets of the 10 largest banks....25-35 %....
152 at a rate of prime + 1/4 or libor + 1/2 to P+2 or L+3....even the repayment of
153 interest is staggering...............But I have rambled on long enough.
154

161 Alex: I remember reading quite a bit about the foreign debt also. We can
162   thank coutries like Brazil and Poland for our misfortunes in the future.
163   While we in the US complain about double digit inflation of 10-12 percent,
164   other countries have TRIPLE digit inflation. One example is Israel, where
165   the current rate os somewhere over 200%!
166       It seems to me, with so much of world society banking on the 
167   international money flow, a large country with a large debt like Brazil
168   could have a much more damaging effect on world economy than our "little"
169   debt here in the US. If foreign investements decline, and the large banks
170   who have billions in loans to countries like Brazil fail, economic
171   pandamonium will result. Easy solution? Like you said, there is none. It
172   will take many years of careful action to reduce the burden these 
173   countries carry. It doesn't look like there is even a complicated way out.
174   I think the world has purchased an enormous debt. It's really scary.
175   The United States has long been considered the life boat of the world.
176   I think it is time to leave the area of the disaster, and try to care for
177   the occupants already on board. Foreign aid...Can we stop it? What about
178   our allies? Can we leave them out in the cold? But can we continue to 
179   spend millions that we don't have? Somewhere there must exist an answer.
180   There must be a way to stop this death spiral of deficit spending. It
181   would be interesting to see what Reagan would do if he was elected. I have
182   heard it often said that it would be better to elect a President for one
183   six year term, with no chance of re-election. This would free the Prez
184   from worrying about losing votes by his actions. A one-shot pres. would
185   solve many of the problems associated with the re-election strain. While
186   Reagan is campaigning, who is running the country? Al Haig? People seem
187   to forget that while the president is out stirring up votes and giving
188   empassioned speaches, the country marches on. I worry about the day when
189   some crisis comes up, and the president striving for re-election is out
190   on some farm in Nebraska telling some farmer how his wheat and corn is
191   going to be worth more next year. They take precautions, but are they
192   enough? I wonder what would happen... Well enough of this.
193 As for Risk, anytime in the next few weekends is fine with me. If
194   you are sufficiently recovered from our last fest, then you set the date.
195   I am sure the rest of us can agree to that.

275 F FIN: My god! they actually upgraded something on one of those beasts?!!
276 I didn't think they even knew how the old stuff worked!
277 
278 Mig: The first step is to make sure that your grounds are real grounds 
279 like I said before. The next step is to put zero-inductance bidirectional
280 transzorbs on the lines. Since the little buggers cost $5 to $10 each
281 though, you might consider going with the poormans tranzorb, a zener
282 diode. A transzorb is just a speacial zener diode that uses silver
283 contacts and special doping to get fast response times. (under a pico 
284 second - how much under, they aren't sure since the tranzorbs act faster
285 then the mesuring equipment.) Anyhow, a couple of zeners back to back 
286 will do for most things. They worked quite well for me when I was putting
287 the afore mentioned computer back into shape. And 10cents is a whole bunch
288 cheaper then $10! then idea is to stop the vlotage spike on the line 
289 before it hits the computer. There are limits to this of course, The
290 normal methode of failure for a zener is to short out which helps in
291 this case since if it was that bad, you would rather have to replace 
292 the zener then the computer. But, if the zap is big enough to burn open 
293 the zener, (we're talking wire melting power here) then it just kinda 
294 melts into a little blubbering blob of chared sillycon. Luckily, about
295 the only thing that would be that strong, is ploping ac line power on
296 the beast, (assuming the fuses didn't blow first) or a direct hit by
297 lightning. The point here is that the zeners can stop lots of volts
298 from wasting your poor computer, but they can only go so far in the
299 amperage dept. Of course if your are paranoid, there are 10KW transzorbs
300 available, and they can be paralleled.......

303 IAN:What?!? a little explosives bother you? Actualy I was refering to the
304 much less dangerous technique where you explode a thin copper wire with gobs
305 of wats. No blasting involved. A great way to get loud radios on a tri-mess
306 bus to quit being loud.
307 Mikey-under a pico-second? I may invest for somethin like that when I
308 get equipment worth something. For now, the zeners at 15 volts trip feeding 
309 a BIG SCR crowbar circuit is what I will use.
310 I forgot who it was, but someone suggested using some wierd 6809 
311 configuration. I am using 6803 and 6805, not too much different except that
312 the 6803 has my serial port and my sound generator in it! and the software
313 re-writes would kill me. I guess I will just put the thing in a large wire 
314 box when not in use. The 6805 system that is, the 6803 is trash.

318 Migguy. If you want, I will send you information on the 6809 kit I mn-
319 tioned. The only problem with this is heat. The 6809EMP gets hot when 
320 used yhis way, but usually works OK if you use a copper heat sink under
321 the lead shielding. There is a ML program that comes with it, which auto-
322 matically switches CPU chips if the one being used should be damaged. 
323 Brcause of the special configuration, when it switches, the DP register
324 becomes 'confused' and the CCR (1) reads overflow. This is easily corrected
325 by pokeing 0 into 65494, waiting a few seconds, and then resetting the 
326 machine. The data will still be in the buffer, and can be recalled. Then
327 poke 0 into 65494 to return the SAM chip to normal speed (remember to 
328 do this, or you will get I/O when you try to load to disc or print. Let
329 me know if you are interested.

384 which is that the EMP is a serious problem. If one large hydrogen bomb 
385 is detonated from a satellite a hundred miles above the Earths surface
386 the resultant EMP causes disruption of communications. OK- not everything
387 is affected. But-some damage will occur to unprotected equipment. If SOME
388 communication is interrupted, the result could be a total nuclear exch
389 between the USSR and the US. For example: Many countries now have satelites
390 (if you want a list, I have one). There are a numbe of nations that have
391 the proverbial bomb. Ergo, one radical group, one remote detonated bomb
392 from a satellite, and we have potential chaos. There is an article in, 
393 I believe, Scientific American, (and other articles elsewhere) that 
394 that theorize that such a single detonation would cause serious disrup-
395 tion to communications over much of the northern heisphere. If ANY dis
396 ruption in communication between us and 'the russians' were to occur at
397 such a time, the potential result could be all out war. Maybe it wouldn't
398 happen. Maybe it would. The point is that it COULD happen. That is why 
399 the EMP is such a big deal. You are partly right in your statement about
400 what it is. A nuclear explosion causes countless trllions of electrons
401 to be 'knocked' out of the outer shell of the atoms /molecules of what
402 makes up the atmosphere: Nitrogen, Oxygen, water vapor, trace gasses 
403 (Xenon, Argon, etc). These electrons tend to form 'lines' parallel to 
404 the magnetic flux lines of the Earths magnetic field, and 'condense' on
405 any conducting material. Antennas, eg. which causes a surge of current
406 (which is, of course the flow of electrons) that can overload the input
407 circuits such as RF Amplifiers, Oscillator/mixer stges,even the IF stages
408 or the detector. The result is obvious. The EMP is a serious problem for
409 two nations who are always ready to fight, but don't want to since they
410 both lose. 
411 A square wave 'hitting' a capacitor? Do you mean th result of capacitace
412 applied to the output of a square wave generator? The result could be 
413 a sawtooth wave, or whatever, depending on the amount of capacitance, 
414 and the time constant, and other factors. Could you be more vague?
415 Migguy- I didn't say we didn't know each other, and I didn't say I would
416 not tell you who I am. You said that. If you do buy a COCO, you might 
417 consider buying an older one, and not the COCO II. Try to find one with
418 an "F" board. It has several advantages. For one, you can use the 'high
419 speed poke which causes the SAM chip to run from 1.5 to 3 times faster.
420 (Put a GOOD heat sink on it). This runs your programs that much faster.
421 Also, using a disc drive is less expensive. Also, dn't buy any R.S. soft
422 ware. Check into 80+, Bee Color in Aloha, etc. PS The 6809EMP is upward
423 compatible, so programs written for other 6800 series CPU's should run
424 100% (at least machine language programs). If you'll tell me how to acss 
425 the NERD, I'll tell you more. PPS, I DO know who you are. Star date EDEN

428   With slow, deliberate steps I moved towards the multi-bladed beast which
429 would thrust me into the vast blue heavens that smiled generously on the sun-
430 drenched earth.  Alas, neither warmth of sun nor gentle caress of summer breeze
431 could ease torment of a sorrow laden soul.
432 Glorious dreams
433 crumbled to dust,
434 and iron-clad schemes
435 riddled by rust
436 
437 Two men with wits fleet
438 and once full of life
439 lie dead at my feet,
440 blood on my knife
441 
442 Twisted visions of might
443 and a craving for power
444 will smother all light -
445 enter the darkest hour.
446 
447   I snapped out of the trance and found myself on the helicopter.  I had climbed
448 aboard and we had lifted off without my realizing it.  My mind was absorbed by the
449 problems I had created for myself.  Now I was headed for the one place that
450 could save me--spiritual contentment to be found only at the largest religious
451 festival in the world.  I think the place was called RAINdeer.
452 <time passes>
453   The land beneath me was green and beautiful.  A few random individuals watched
454 as the helicopter descended onto the field.  One person in particular caught my 
455 eye.  He wore a plaid flannel shirt, overalls with suspenders, and cowboy boots.
456 A blade of grass fell from between his teeth as he stared in open-mouthed
457 wonder.  The look of awe was plastered on his face even as I cleared myself of
458 the helicopter and it took off again.
459   He managed the word "wow!"  Then he turned to me.  "Howneck Dzatwirk?"
460 (Read with 'hick' accent)
461   "No,"  I answered.  "I'm Petrov.  Tell me, how do I get to the festival
462 from here?"
463   The man's face made a few distortions indicating he was not very fond of the
464 Dance of the Dangerfield Festival.  He said nothing , but pointed west, past a
465 small hill.
466   As I walked I wondered about this Howneck Dzatwirk fellow I was mistaken for.
467 Something seemed odd about the name, almost familiar.  Howneck Dzatwirk...
468 How-neck dzat wirk...How 'n' eck does 'at work!  Arghhh!  That terrible hick accent, it all
469 made sense now.  Howneck Dzatwirk--How in the heck does that work!  He was
470 asking about the helicopter!
471   I was getting very worried about this.  The natives spoke a language I
472 couldn't understand.  What's worse, they seemed to know almost nothing about
473 modern technology.  There I was, all alone--surrounded by ignorant Orygon
474 savages.  I quickened my pace and hoped I wouldn't run into any indians.

478 Laissez-faire - I believe my statement was "change is the very nature of
479    this reality we experience", however I'll attempt to answer in the
480    context of your question. Consider the idea that a person is and always
481    has been in a state of perfection. True enough, many of us learn some
482    habits, early in life, which prevent this state from being manifest in
483    our day to day activities. One of the distortions of perception is to
484    equate a person's actions and habits as being that person. Some have  
485    acquired ways of interacting with other people that are quite obnoxious.
486    This does not mean they are beyond hope. I prefer to believe that under   
487    the proper stimulus the inherent good qualities will emerge. One of the 
488    traditional roles of spiritual practice has been to introduce a person   
489    to techniques that will develop patterns of behavior, which embrace the
490    fundamental state of perfection. This is not to say that I agree with 
491    some of the modern forms of religion. Some seem to have gotten diverted 
492    from the main course. Fortunately there is still access to techniques
493    that can assist a person toward becoming a complete human being.
494   
495    I don't know what R. Bach has to say about perfection. If you'd care to
496    summarize it here, I'd be interested. I'd also be more interested in     
497    your impressions and ideas, concerning this subject.

500    HI.
501       I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A COUPLE

505  LANGUAGE.(ALL THAT IS,EXCEPT FOR THE

507         SECOND,TO ASP,WOULD YOU LIKE
508  TO USE A DIFFERENT BBS FOR A GAME 
509  DISCUSSION?

514 unknownguy:MOST interesting. The only person I know who is involved with 6809
515 and other motorola gear I just talked too. Perhaps you know of project Wendy? noname? does`the 
516 sequence "e4403..." mean anything to you? 
517 All:Due to a change in plans, I will be a porsfis.
518 The 6809EMP may be upward compatable, but what about the instructions for my sound and serial 
519 port? (6803) and my`4MA/MHZ power consumption on the 6805? The CoCo I get will be on credit, so 
520 I am stuck with the 2. But there is always a way to speed up RS gear. I already know about not 
521 buying RS software.

525 
526 M.M. - Very well said.  I tip my hat to your erudition.  Bach is very similar in his 
527        beliefs about perfection, although he gives striving to attain that perfection as
528        teh reason we exist.  Not to 'Help our fellow man', or 'Make a bundle', but 'To
529        strive for perfection'.  To be perfect is to not have limits.  Try to see 
530        yourself as more than just a body, think of your perfect limitless self.  (The soul
531        if you prefer.)  That is the essence of Bach's philosophy.  It is quite similar, in
532        many ways to the 'Quality' of Phaedru}s, or the 'Arete' of the Sophists.
533 
534        Many eastern religions are concerned with attaining that perfection, or Nirvanna
535        State, and give meditation and introspection as the mode of arrival.  I feel that
536        man is so limited in his experience that perfection in this manner is impossible.
537 
538        Christians believe that perfection is only found in bodily death and spiritual 
539        resurrection through salvation by the blood of Jesus.  This eliminates the problem
540        of human frailty of both body and soul.
541 
542        Atheists do not believe in perfection, in my experience.  Anything can be improved
543        at least a little.  I do not subscribe to that possibility, for I have seen 
544        perfection in a sunset, in a wave, in a mother's love.
545 
546        Someone who is Islamic is required to tell what they believe, although it seems to 
547        me, again from my limited experience, that they feel that they are all perfect
548        already and everyone else is less than perfect by not being Islamic.  If there is
549        an subscriber to Islam out there, please let us know.  (And not a fake, please.)
550 
551        A most interesting topic, perfection.  Each has his own concept of perfection, I 
552        suspect.  As well as truth.

564 MIG: If your trying to protect against static discharge, don't bother
565 with the scr. By the time it would get around to firing it would be
566 too late anyway. Find yourself a nice 1 watt surmetic zener that
567 should take care of the problem if it exists. SCRs are for flaky
568 power supplies where supposedly you have enough time to crash the
569 whole thing before it trashes your computer. Sometimes it works,
570 and some times it don't. The problem with SCR crowbars is that they
571 have a nasty habit of firing on their own, particularly when some
572 CB'er fires up his 100W linear next door. 
573 I am dropping out of the EMP debate, you people are getting too weird
574 on me. Raining electrons, blowing up the power system, destroying all
575 communications....  Sheshh....
