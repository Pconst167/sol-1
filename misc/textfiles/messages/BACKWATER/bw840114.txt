20   Rory sat as he had been sitting for -- how long?  He stroked his long red 
21 beard.  He had been clean-shaven when he left the inn.  How long had he been here?
22   He rolled his practice chanter in his hands, and ran his fingers lightly over
23 the holes in its length.
24   ---HOW?? ---He had come here with nothing!!
25 
26   The unseen piper winded his pipes, then a strange melody arose.  Rory started, 
27 made as if to raise from the ground, then relaxed.
28 This was not just a melody, this was the canntaireachd, a translation of the 
29 human voice to the inhuman tones of the pipes.  Nine holes peirced the walls of 
30 the chanter, the poirtion of the pipes the piper fingered.  This gave ten distinct
31 tones, each one standing for a vowel.  The piper shifts from one vowel tone to
32 another with lightning gracing notes in distinct sound patterns.  These gracings
33 sound remarkably like constants.
34   In the old language, the unseen piper spoke in the language of the
35 canntaireachd to Rory.
36 
37      "Long have I searched to find you
38       Long are the days I searched for you
39       Long are the nights without you
40       Long are the years that you were gone
41       Long was the way to come to you
42       Long will the years be before I am gone.
43 
44       SORROW IS MINE WITHOUT YOU        YOU MUST RETURN TO ME
45       SORROW IS YOURS WITHOUT ME        I MUST RETURN TO YOU
46       SORROW ALONE WILL DWELL           WE MUST TOGETHER BE
47       PREPARE YOURSELF FOR MY COMING    FOR I SHALL COME TO YOU
48 
49       long have i searched to find you
50       long has the way been for me
51       long have i searched to find you
52       long have you been far from me

54       prepare for you will come to me

56 The pipes cut off abruptly.  Rory smiled a quiet smile, then rose and went down 
57 to the bank of the pool.  He stripped off his clothing and made a small pile
58 on the bank.  He placed his skean dubh
59 on top of the pile then plunged into the icy pool.
60   Chilled nearly to the bone, he heard another splash behind him.  Turning, he 
61 beheld -- his own face.  The stranger coming toward him was himself --
62 with a slight difference.  Rory had a beard and hair of light red, the 
63 stranger had hair and beard of black.  The stranger moved nearer, then 
64 Rory neither saw nor felt any more.
65 
66 A stranger, had one been present, would have seen a strange sight.  Two
67 men, one with black hair and beard, one with red-blond hair and beard 
68 entered the pool.  A single man left--
69 his hair was dark with reddish highlights, his beard redder, but still 
70 dark.  Of the two that entered, there was no trace.  Our observer, had 
71 one been present, would be hard pressed to explain the **blurring** of the
72 two and emergence of only one.
73 
74 The dark man walked slowly from the pool.  Two piles of clothing lay upon
75 the bank.  He picked a linen blouse from a pile, then slid it over his 
76 head.  Taking a large rectangle of softly woven wool, he pleated it on the
77 ground over a heavy belt, lay on it and folded it over himself.  He buckled
78 the belt and arose.  A cairngorm brooch held the trailing end of the belted
79 plaid to his left shoulder.  He finished dressing, then bent over and touched
80 a small pile of discards, left from both.  He smiled softly, picked up a
81 handsome stand of silver-mounted pipes, placed them under his right arm,
82 then walked softly out of the glade.  He winded the pipes, and went 
83 downstream, his step light, music wafting before him.

87 It was the ranger Arvid rode homeward through the hills
88 Among the shadowy shiverleafs, along the chiming rills.
89 The dance weaves under the firethorn.
90 
91 The night wind whispered round him with scent of brok and rue.
92 Both moons rose high above him and hills aflash with dew.
93 The dance weaves under the firethorn.
94 
95 And dreaming of that woman who waited in the sun,
96 He stopped, amazed by starlight, and so he was undone.
97 The dance weaves under the firethorn.
98 
99 For there beneath a barrow that bulked athwart a moon,
100 The Outling folk were dancing in glass and golden shoon.
101 
102 The Outling folk were dancing like water, wind and fire
103 To frosty ringing harpstrings, and never did they tire.
104 The dance weaves under the firethorn.
105 
106 To Arvid came she striding from where she watched the dance,
107 The Queen of Air and Darkness, with starlight in her glance.
108 
109 With starlight, love and terror in her immortal eye,
110 The Queen of Air and Darkness cried softly under sky:
111 
112 "Light down, you ranger Arvid, and join the Outling folk.
113 You need no more be human, which is a heavy yoke."
114 The dance weaves under the firethorn.
115 
116 He dared to give her answer: "I may do naught but run.
117 A maiden waits me, dreaming in lands beneath the sun.
118 
119 And likewise wait me comrades and tasks I would not shirk,
120 For what is ranger Arvid if he lays down his work?
121 
122 So wreak your spell, you Outling, and cast your wrath on me.
123 Though maybe you can slay me, you'll not make me unfree."
124 The dance weaves under the firethorn.
125 
126 The Queen of Air and Darkness stood wrapped about with fear
127 And northlight-flares and beauty.He dared not look to near.
128 
129 Until she laughed like harpsong and said to him in scorn:
130 "I do not need a magic to make you always mourn.
131 
132 I send you home with nothing except your memory
133 Of moonlight, Outling music, night breezes, dew and me.
134 
135 And that will run behind you, a shadow on the sun,
136 And that will lie beside you when every day is done.
137 
138 In work and play and friendship your grief will strike you dumb
139 For thinking what you are -- and -- what you might have become.
140 
141 Your dull and foolish woman treat kindly as you can.
142 Go home now, ranger Arvid, set free to be a man!"
143 The dance weaves under the firethorn.
144 
145 In flickering and laughter the Outling folk were gone.
146 He stood alone by moonlight and wept until the dawn.
147 The dance weaves under the firethorn.

149 There was so much to learn, the properties and uses of stones, the 
150 uses of plants. How to read the runes, the cards, and now this new thing-
151 the - he glanced at the book again- the "Book of Changes". When would it all 
152 end?
153 He set the book back upon the shelf and prepared to leave for the Inn.
154 No, wait! he said to himself, master will skin me for sure if I don't take
155 Pam something for her trouble. He took down another book and read:
156 For Colds & Rheums: take tea made from root, not bark, of sassafras tree.
157 Alright, now where is it? Ah, there it is! So saying, he placed
158 a packet in his pouch and replaced the book.
159 Later, passing over the bridge, he stopped and stared downstream awhile.
160 Before continueing on his way, he could not resist the impulse to face 
161 downstream and bow. "O bearer of the staff, be thou welcome!"
162 Arriving at the Inn, he saw that it was somewhat less crowded than of late. 
163 Not seeing Pam or d, he left the tea with the Innkeeper.
164 As he ate he wondered at his dreams of the previous night. At first he had 
165 been talking with Whisper Rose, but then as the dream continued, she vanished
166 and other shapes appeared. A fierce Pegasus, rosy-hued Amber, and --
167 a Monical? While he was not certain of their meaning, he suspected that they 
168 might be clues in his search. He still was not certain of her origins, she 
169 knew about his past and his master's, yet he could not bring her to mind
170 when he searched the memories of those days. He hoped that things would
171 become clearer soon.
172 ..........................................the apprentice.....................
173 For Leroy & friends, I have found a song that seems to have been
174 written with them in mind. The tune is "Londonderry Air"
175 The New Londonderry Air
176 
177 Our Morris Miner's running out of petrol;
178 The bomb is set to go at half past five;
179 It's quarter past, and we're stuck here in traffic,
180 I doubt that we'll get out of this alive.
181 
182 The IRA has really blown it this time;
183 This time I fear we've spread ourselves too thin.
184 And when the bobbies come to clear the wreckage,
185 On every Ulster face you'll see a narsty grin.
186 
187 (sorry, but with all the poems & songs, I couldna resist!)

190 PAM: Thanks for the kind words a disk or so back but I hardly ever leave
191 anything anymore as the current mode the Inn seems to be in is of no in-
192 terest to me. I much prefer the heated discussions of politics, religion
193 and other subjects that shouldn't be discussed face to face.
194 These current ramblings seem to be nothing more than an extension of D/D
195 and I find those games foolish and very useless. I would like to see more
196 valid information here and on the other boards rather than this childish 
197 prattle, sorry but that the way I feel.
198 I will continue to monitor the activities here but doubt that I will have
199 much to contribute toward the current drivell, hope there is a change soon
200 as it is most dificult to get a line to the Inn anymore.
201 Anyway Happy New Year to you and yours and I do hope your depression has
202 abated.

205      The warm sun beamed down on the crowded marketplace.  The exotic aromas
206 and noisy hubbub assailed the senses.  The small, wiry man lounged at the
207 head of an alleyway.  His one good eye scanned the jostling crown for a
208 likely mark; a pocket to pick or a pursestring to cut.
209      Suddenly, at his side a tall, khaki clad man appeared.  The ferret-
210 faced man nervously glanced from side to side trying to find escape from
211 his nemisis.  Inspector Salazar gazed intently at the one called Weasel.
212      "Weasel, don't leave just yet.   I need some information."
213      "Ah Inspector, I'm just a humble laborer.  I mind my own business."
214      Salazar's eyes flashed with impatience; "
215      "Tell me about the murder on the beach and anything you know about    
216 McKane."  At the mention of 'McKane', fear flooded into the Weasel's eyes.
217      "I know my rights--I don't have to talk with you."  He turned to leave.
218      Suddenly, Salazar's hand snaked out...grasping the Weasel by the throat.
219 His feet dangled inches from the rough cobblestones.  He beheld a terrible
220 vision of the Inspector's face close to his.  Salazar spoke softly as to a
221 lover; "The only right you have is to talk to me; maybe then, you can keep
222 your life.  I have no time for games today.  Give me what I want and you
223 will be well paid."
224      The Weasel sputtered; "Awk! Alright, just put me down."  After being set
225 down, the words tumbled out; "The murdered girl's name was Natasha.  The 
226 word on the street is that one known as Ninja Loo Tau Foo murdered her.
227 She was McKane's lover. As for McKane himself..." He looked at Salazar
228 craftily, "That will cost you a thousand."
229      Salazar reached into his pocked.  "Weasel, this had better be good or
230 I'll remove your other eye."  He handed him a wad of bills.  The Weasel 
231 passed him a powder blue envelope and without a word disappeared into the
232 crowd.  Inspector Salazar started to read as he walked through the market.

234 My Dearest Mohammed;
235      Success is at hand.  We now have the old man.  He's not as cute as the
236 Dali Lama, but he'll do in a pinch.  With our share of the ransom--Albania
237 will soon be free.
238      I haven't found a replacement for Pedro yet. (Heavy Sigh!) Also the
239 dwarf has been kidnapped, but that's not important.  The ringmaster of the
240 Ukraine Travelling Circus gave me another in return for my favors.
241      The ninja still threatens and may have killed Natasha.  Petrov is still
242 as weird as ever.  God, what a zoo.  How I miss you...
243                                              --Serena--
244 *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
245      The Inspector strode purposefully into the police station.  Espying his
246 aide he barked out; "Start looking for someone known as the Ninja and pickup
247 Mohammed Wassir, the crazy Albanian.  IMMEDIATELY!"  
248    To himself..."Either I'll have some answers or we'll have Albanian goulash
249 for dinner."
250 !~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!Valinor!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!~!
251 
252 Gary:
253      I should introduce myself.  I have the personnas of Mohammed, Serena,
254 and Valinor.  I really enjoy your work.  The AP news story was a real gem.
255 At times I'm hard put to keep up with the plot twists, but I love it.
256 Now for the question, why did you kill off Natasha.  Not griping, just
257 curious.
258                                             Mike Bigham
259 *****************************************************************************
260 :*************************************************************:
261 
262 Mike:
263 
264 Pleased to meet you. Thanks for the praise...always a
265 appreciated. Obviously I'm a great fan of your work as well. 
266 
267 I've also become a fan of Valinor. I love the way he 
268 transitioned the McKane adventure into a different format. I 
269 also appreciate the Bogart influence...nice touch.
270 
271 I, too, have trouble keeping up with the plot twists. That's 
272 OK, though, it's all part of the experimental medium.
273 
274 I killed Natasha for two reasons:
275 
276     1) I screwed up when I made her mentally ill. To maintain 
277        my credibility I need to keep my mental health and 
278        fantasy stuff totally separate. I was correcting an 
279        error in judgement.
280 
281    2)  I was trying to keep the plot moving. I've noticed that 
282        one of the pitfalls of multiple authored fantasy is 
283        that it's real easy to get bogged down in 
284        characterization or descriptive passages.
285 
286       By killing Natasha I was trying to open up a new 
287       dimension of the plot. From the description of the 
288       investigation of Natasha's death it seems to have worked.
289 
290       The AP story was another effort to get the action 
291       moving. Hopefully it will open up another dimension of 
292       the adventure and keep it from getting bogged down.
293 
294 So much for now. Want to close by acknowledging how much I've 
295 enjoyed having Mohammed & cronies to bounce my imagination 
296 off. LeRoy wouldn't have survived without you.

303 
304      I WAKE COVERED WITH SWEAT, AND THE FOUL STINK OF FEAR PERMEATES THE
305 ROOM.  I HAD A DREAM, ONLY PARTS OF WHICH I REMEMBER, AND A BATTLE FOR THE
306 POSSESSION OF MY SOUL.  AND THE FACE OF THE MAN I FOUGHT WITH....IS KNOWN TO
307 ME SOMEHOW....YES, AS I REMEMBER, HIS NAME IS MIDER.  BUT FROM WHERE DO I
308 KNOW HIM, AND HOW CAME HE TO INHABIT MY DREAM?
309 
310      AS I ARISE FROM MY BED, I REALIZE THAT I AM MUCH WEAKER THAN I HAD IM-
311 AGINED, FOR I SWAY AND MUST CATCH AT THE BEDPOST TO PREVENT A FALL.  IF THE
312 ROOM WOULD ONLY STOP SPINNING...
313 
314      AH, THAT IS BETTER.  AT LEAST MY BROW IS COOLER, THE FEVER HAVING BROK-
315 EN DURING MY SLEEP.  BUT I HAVE NO VIGOR, NO STRENGTH, AND I THINK THAT I
316 WOULD BE FOOLISH TO ATTEMPT TO GO TO THE INN THIS DAY.  PERHAPS IT WOULD BE
317 BEST FOR ME TO STAY AT HOME AND TAKE CARE OF MY HEALTH.
318 
319      LOOKING OUT MY WINDOW, I SEE THAT THE COLD AND FOG OF THE EVENING PAST
320 HAS TURNED TO RAIN TODAY.  IT IS DREARY AND DEPRESSING, PERHAPS TO MATCH MY
321 MOOD OF LATE, AND THE GREYNESS OF THE SKY IS NO GREYER THAN MY OWN MOOD.  I
322 SEE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MESSAGES LEFT UPON MY STEP, AND OPENING THE
323 DOOR TO READ THEM MAY GIVE ME SOME NEW AIR TO RELIEVE THE VAPORS.  AH, DEAR
324 CISTOP LEAVES A COMPLIMENT, AND A COMMISERATION.  SURELY NO INN HAS SUCH A
325 KEEPER, ONE WHOSE CONCERN FOR HIS CUSTOMERS IS AS DEEP AS A DOTING PARENT!
326 
327      A COMMENT FROM AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE, FRIEND CYM, WHICH CAUSES A SMILE TO
328 CROSS MY FACE MOMENTARILY.  HE WISHES FOR THE OLD DAYS, WHEN RESOUNDING DE-
329 BATE ECHOED THROUGH THE HALLS OF THE INN, WISHES PERHAPS FOR A RETURN TO
330 THOSE TIMES.  THEY MAY ONE DAY RETURN, BUT THE CURRENT POLICIES IN FAVOUR IN
331 THE INN IS MORE LIKE DAYS LONG PAST.  THEN I WAS BUT A HUSHED AND RESPECTFUL
332 OBSERVER IN THE DARK CORNERS.  WHEN CHANGE CAME, AND I HAD MASTERED THE IN-
333 TRICACIES HERE, I JOINED IN.  BUT AS HAPPENS THROUGHOUT LIFE AND THE WORLD,
334 CHANGE CAME AGAIN, AND THE INN TOOK ON THE APPEARANCE OF OLDER TIMES.  I'LL
335 JOIN IN THE FRAY, NO MATTER THE STYLE, SINCE I TRY TO ADAPT AND FIT IN NO
336 MATTER WHAT (SHORT OF VIOLATING MY OWN ETHICAL POSITIONS).  AND DRIVEL, LIKE
337 SO MUCH ELSE IN LIFE, IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER.  GOOD CYM, REMEMBER THE
338 WORDS OF THAT FAMED PHILOSOPHER, THEODORE STURGEON, WHO SAID:
339 
340                           "99% OF EVERYTHING IS CRAP!"
341 
342      AND A FINAL LETTER, FROM AN APPRENTICE, WHICH INCLUDES A REMEDY FOR
343 AILMENTS AND INFECTIONS!  INDEED, A THOUGHFUL AND GRACIOUS YOUNG MAN IS HE
344 WHO WOULD THINK SO KINDLY OF ONE HE ONLY KNOWS IN PASSING.  THE MASTER MUST
345 TEACH THE APPRENTICE WELL, AND IN WAYS OF GENTLE LIFE AS IN HIS APPOINTED
346 TRADE.  I WILL THANK HIM WHEN NEXT I GET THE CHANCE AT THE INN.
347 
348      THESE EPISTLES HAVE DONE MUCH TO STRENGTHEN ME, MORE THAN I WOULD HAVE
349 THOUGHT POSSIBLE FROM SIMPLE PIECES OF PAPER.  BUT IT IS NOT THE PAPER THAT
350 HELPS ME, BUT THE THOUGHTS OF THOSE THAT HAVE CARED ENOUGH TO CREATE THEM.
351 THE WARMTH OF THEIR CARING IS STILL WITHIN ME AS I LOOK UP AND OUT THROUGH
352 MY YARD TO BEHOLD THE GATE THAT WAS NEW THE NIGHT BEFORE.  WHAT I SEE NOW
353 CHILLS ME AGAIN, FOR THE GATE IS GONE, SMASHED INTO MANY SHARDS, AND SPREAD
354 ABOUT THE YARD AS THOUGH BY A GREAT FORCE.  I TURN BACK TO ENTER MY HOME,
355 AND I AM SHOCKED TO SEE THAT ONE OF THE PIECES OF THE GATE, ITS POINT SHARP-
356 ENED AND KNIFELIKE, IS BURIED IN THE HARD WOOD OF THE DOOR LIKE A SPEAR.  IT
357 HOLDS A TORN CLOTH OF MANY COLOURS, UPON WHICH IS WRITTEN A MESSAGE IN AN
358 INK BLACKER THAN THE HEART OF A TAX COLLECTOR:
359 
360      "Know ye, O woman, that my love can be sweeter than life itself,
361      Grand as the best of wines, eternal and without surcease;
362      More intoicating than the best ale of Inisfail
363      Is what I would offer you.
364 
365      "But you that would deny me, prevent me my due,
366      Steal my heart and then fly to you petty mortal dealings;
367      You fill me with rage, passion beyond compare!
368      In your small mind, beware my wrath, for none can deny me!"
369 
370      SHUTTING MY DOOR, I REALIZE THAT I WILL INDEED GO TO THE INN TODAY, AND
371 I THINK THAT I WILL SPEND THE NIGHT THERE.  SUDDENLY, MY HOME IS FRIGHTENING
372 TO ME, A PLACE ALIEN AND VIOLATED BY A POWER I DON'T UNDERSTAND.  I HOPE MY
373 GOOD FRIEND d WILL BE THERE, HER WIT IS SUCH A COMFORT.

377 To the inspector:
378     I am giving you a warning to back off the Natasha case. The Ninja have no
379 cause to kill the likes of you but don't like anyone who asks questions. We are many and our fanaticism can easily

400      He wasn't used to speaking other than the nonsense songs he'd
401 sung back to the birds and the animal imitations he'd used.  He had talked
402 to the ground hogs, but they weren't much for conversation.  He scranbled out
403 of the bushes, wrapping his arms in a bone crunching hug around Ben's neck.
404 "Where we going?"

406      Marc was all arms reaching for knobs in the cockpit as Ben firmly
407 strapped him into the crash webbing.  "Excited?" But Marc had no answer,
408 he was busy fingering the catch on the web.  Ben didn't need an answer
409 anyway.
410      "Sleep now, little one, it's a long ride."  Ben directed.  The
411 speeder rose noiselessly straight up until Ben was sure that he was
412 high enough that his passing would not disturb any of the other children
413 in the vast, rolling plains.  After the morning's exertions, even the
414 excitement of being in the speeder was no competition to the warmth
415 and comfort of the crash couch.  As if triggered by Ben's words, he
416 dropped immediately into a deep sleep.

460 HELLO. HOW ARE YOU DOING? DO YOU LEAVE 
461 MESSAGES VERY OFTEN ON THIS SYSTEM? I 
462 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
463   AS I ENTERED THE INN, I AM OVERCOME BY AN AMAZING SIGHT. INSTEAD OF THE 
464 INDIVIDUALITY THAT IS COMMON HERE, THE PEOPLE SEEM TO BE GATHERED IN ONLY THREE
465 GROUPS. THE LARGEST, WHICH ATTRACTS THE ATTENTION OF THE INNKEEPER, CONSISTS
466 OF MANY PEOPLE RECOUNTING ADVENTURES BOTH REALISTIC AND FANCIFUL. I STOP
467 TO LISTEN, BUT KNOW I AM NOT UP TO THE STANDARDS OF THIS GROUP. ANY ATTEMPT
468 TO CONTRIBUTE WOULD BE RIDICULOUS. I MOVE ON TO A SECOND GROUP, WHICH ARE 
469 DISCUSSING MATTERS IN HUSHED TONES, WITH MANY REFERENCES TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES
470 OF WHICH I KNOW LITTLE. THIS IS NOT MY FORTE, EITHER, SO I INVESTIGATE THE LAST
471 AND SMALLEST ONE. TOPICS FLOWING HERE ARE QUITE REALISTIC, BUT ARE FEW AND
472 RIDDEN WITH LARGE WORDS BEYOND MY KEN. I SIT IN AWE OF THE OBVIOUS POWER AND
473 KNOWELDGE OF THESE PEOPLE, BUT AM AT A LOSS AT WHAT TO DO.
474   I MOVE TO AN UNOCCUPIED SECTION OF THE INN, WISHING FOR SOME DISCUSSION
475 OF TOPICS BOTH REAL AND NOT, THAT A SIMPLE, UNTALENTED PERSON CAN ENTER.
476 IN A MOMENTARY FIT OF MADNESS, I STAND UP AND CRY,
477  "WHO DO YOU LIKE FOR THE 1984 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION?"
478 AS I PERCIEVE THE COLD STARES OF THE PARTONS, I WONDER WHAT THE RESULTS OF
479 MY ACTION WILL BE............

484 LEATHERS ON AND STRAPPED HER DUREUM MACE TO HER FOREARM WHERE HIDDEN
485 BY THE SLEEVE IT WAS INSTANTLY AVAILABLE AT NEED. WITH A GRATEFUL NOD TO
486 THE INNKEEP SHE SETTLED HER TAB AND CROSSING THE BRIDGE TOOK TO THE WOODS
487 MOVING UPSTREAM. MOVING SILENTLY IN THE PRACTICED MANNER OF AN EXPERIENCED
488 THIEF SHE SLID ALMOST INVISIBLY FROM DAPPLED SHADOW TO DAPPLED SHADOW.
489 WHO KNEW WHAT SHE WOULD FIND UP THIS TINY TRIBUTARY. PERHAPS A GIANT OR
490 SOME WIZARDS LONELY KEEP, WHERE SHE COULD LIBERATE A FEW "SMALL" COINS
491 OR SOME OLD AND MUSTY TOME TO GIVE TO HER MASTER. NOT MENTIONING OF

504      Night visions of men dressed in black scuttling through the night
505 plagued the sleep of Salazar...He awoke in darkness to find his sheets
506 soaked in sweat...His heart full of apprension.  Though a man not given
507 to fear, he knew he would face Death's grinning visage soon enough.  He
508 also knew that if perchance he might survive...He would experience an
509 exhileration known to few mortals...

535 it is true that they are not the main thrust, they are still part of what I must

537 I am not yet skilled enough to aid in the current matter, but I am sure that my
538 master could be of aid.

540 He looked at the letter again, sighed, and tossed it into the fire. Some things
541 are better said face-to-face... He got up and walked over to
542 Pam's table.

558      "Ah, good day, Mr. Valerius." The dwarf smiled from his cushioned
559 divan.  "Thank you so much for the weekend.  I had a wonderful time."
560 he mumbled as one of the hostesses popped another grape into his mouth.
561 "But I fear I must be getting back."
562 
563      "Certainly, Phillipe."  The tall figure smiled.  His white dinner
564 jacket was folded over one arm, concealing the hand.  Phillipe glanced
565 suspiciously.  "Are you planning to be near Marakesh?  I might have
566 a job for you."  Contremon smiled, and pulled on the jacket.  No weapons
567 showed, and Phillipe relaxed.
568      "Why, yes, monsieur.  I will be meeting a friend."
569      "Excellent, my friend, excellent.  There is a man in Marakesh.  His
570 name is Salizar.  I have been informed that he is in danger."  Valerius
571 removed a roll of currency from his jacket pocket, along with what 
572 appeared to be a key, a large, ornate gold key.  He placed the key quickly
573 back into his jacket, and handed the currency to the dwarf.  "Take this,
574 my private jet is waiting on the runway. You must be in Marakesh tonight.
575 Go to Salizar, for tonight there will be an attempt on his life, and you
576 must be there to stop it, my friend.  Only your talents will suffice
577 this night."  With that he strode out of the room.  The dinner guests
578 awaited, and this was a special evening.  He fingered the key as he
579 descended the stairs.

600 There are many people that come to mind that are not only quallified but extremely electable
601 alas the problem is to gey them to run for the office. I really can't blame them for not
602 wanting to run as it seems to be a thankless job in the long run no matter what yoyur political
604 affiliation. It used to be that they waited til you and your imediate family had all
605 passed over, then it was when you had gone
606 now there are no holds bared and the muck rakers are at it from every angle. 
607 What we need is a purely non-payed political
608 group in Washington and our state houses and a time limit on their tenure. Take the profit out of the game and we might get
609 some responsible people to run for office. Of course they would be on a flat rate per-diem to
610 cover the everyday expenses but not a penny more. The private assets, if any would be
611 frozen for the duration of their term.
612 Lets get a discussion going on this idea, who knows it might help, it certainly won't hurt.

617 
618      A VERY INTERESTING CONCEPT, CYM.  BY TAKING AWAY THE PROFIT MOTIVE YOU
619 WOULD CERTAINLY ELIMINATE THOSE WHOSE INTEREST IN POLITICS WAS MOTIVATED BY
620 GREED.  HOWEVER, YOU WOULDN'T LOSE THOSE WHOSE POLITICAL DESIRE CAME FROM A
621 NEED FOR POWER OVER OTHERS.  BY TAKING AWAY ANY CHANCE FOR PROFIT, YOU MIGHT
622 RESTRICT POLITICAL OFFICE TO ONLY THOSE WHO COULD AFFORD TO TAKE 4 YEARS OFF
623 TO DEVOTE TO SUCH THINGS.  "THE SELLING OF THE PRESIDENCY" DESCRIBES HOW DE-
624 CISIONS IN OFFICE CAN BE MOTIVATED BY PROMISES FROM LARGE CORPORATIONS TO
625 PROVIDE MONEY OR EMPLOYMENT AFTER THAT INDIVIDUAL'S TERM IS ENDED.  IT SEEMS
626 TO ME THAT THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOR MIGHT BE ENCOURAGED BY YOUR PLAN.  IS THERE
627 ANY WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM THAT YOU CAN SEE?  OOPS, I'M OUT OF SPACE!
