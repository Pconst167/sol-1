23 Gaius was sweating. The problem, he thought, is that you can't count on the kind of help you get in this business.
24 Where, he wondered, are all the HONEST, HARDWORKNING thugs and degenerates?
25 He was seated at the console of his IBM, or Insect Battle Machine, attempting to coordinate the formic assault on 
26 the Inn. Ants followed directions well, but they were very literal-minded and he was finding it a challenge to 
27 Give them the right instructions that would make their attack on the Inn a success. I shouldn't be doing this, he
28 thought, this's that Bullyboy's job. He was TRAINED for it. I'm an Executive. I worry about the Big Picture. Why  
29 is a man in my position subjected to this kind of humiliation, while Bullyboy gets to lounge around in some 
30 distant universe. And he'll just be back when all the WORK's done with some cock-and-bull excuse. I shouldn't be
31 here. And I most certainly shouldn't have had to put the sugar in that Frenchman's gas tank myself. If anyone from
32 the Arch-Villian's club had seen me dressed as a GREASE MONKEY, I'd never live it down. Now to finish off the Inn 
33 once and for all.  The warped genius turned his full attention back to the IBM as he finalized the directions for
34 the the marauding ants.

36 Billy-Bob Bullyboy had had pleasanter vacations. This place seemed to go on forever, dark and smelly. This place
37 smells like Ma's old pipe, he mused, but Ma wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this...
38 And he continued walking, toward the invisible horizon.

41 Apprentice, if you have some of the right pheronomes in your pouch of 
42 potions and a simple fly spell. we could drop it on half of the ants
43 and let them fight each other instead of us.

50   The pipes tuned and in full swing, the piper felt the path that he was on
51 turning and changing around him.  He had the sensation of standing on the brow
52 of a !!VERY!! steep hill.  Using the music to hold his position, he moved 
53 laterally off the path and found himself walking down an exit ramp from a large
54 freeway through a desolate countryside.  "Oh fine!" he thought.  "This is
55 no place to try to hitchike and try to remain healthy."
56   Segueing into a march (the Dundee Millatary Tatto) he wove a coccoon of sund
57 around himself and walked forward in search of the ones he followed.  It was
58 early in the morning here, he noticed just as he came upon a little group 
59 surrounding one of those four-wheeled artifacts that he had last encountered
60 before the trip up the Ka-lumbee-a.  They seemed a trifle upset, bristling
61 with weapons.  There was Bard, Voyeur, The Man Sans Parity, another person
62 that he did not recognize and a large canoform creature that he eyed with 
63 suspicion.  Coming closer to the group he let the song die, then took down
64 his pipes from his shoulder.  "Hi, guys.  What brings you to this desolate
65 corner of one of the most entropy-ridden realities I can remember seeing?

115 		Space is Dark (words & music: Bill Roper)
116 Chorus:	Space is dark and space is deep,
117 	And the price we've paid is far too steep.
118 	Though we've gained a hero's name,
119 	We're all cripples just the same,
120 	And the scars we bear will testify
121 	To the pain we've found beyond the sky.
122 We set out in our starship in twenty-forty-nine,
123 Sent to ply the galaxy, another earth to find.
124 They put us in our coffins and gently closed the lid.
125 And if I'd known then what I know now, I'd've wished we'd wake up dead.
126 
127 And so we flew a thousand years through interstellar space.
128 Light years seperated us from the human race.
129 Then at last we slowed as we approached our target star,
130 And now we'd find the reason that we'd travelled so far.
131 CHORUS
132 As we awoke from frozen sleep, we each knew what to do.
133 We'd scan the sky about the star for a planet shining blue.
134 We'd pull into an orbit, and check her atmosphere,
135 And run a half a hundred tests to see if she proved fair.
136 
137 We'd monitor the radio so that we could see
138 If there were any aliens who'd come here before we.
139 Then from our receiver a tiny voice we heard,
140 And it spoke to us in English and we understood each word.
141 CHORUS
142 Ten years we had been on our way when they found the hyperdrive,
143 And man spread to a thousand stars while we were half alive.
144 But still they could not stop our ship to save us from our fate.
145 And so we have arrived here but nine hundred years too late.
146 
147 They told us we were heroes, pinned medals on our chests,
148 And they gave us a fine pension and sent us off to rest.
149 For we're anachronisms from another place and time,
150 And so they have retired us though we're all still in our prime.CHORUS
151 And of the ten men in our crew, but two of us remain,
152 For trapped here in the future, we all have gone insane.
153 We knew when we set out that we'd be gone a thousand years,
154 But we never thought we'd end up as unwanted pensioneers.
155 
156 And soon we two will follow where the other eight have gone,
157 And then our long sad journey will finally be done.
158 In the next room waiting is my time-lost lonely wife,
159 And I'll see her one last time as we take each other's life.

179 The lazy one floats into the inn motioning for a pitcher. The Dark please,

181 insects and making too much noise for me to concentrate on this new book
182 I got in last night. Some kind of historical romance by a minor god on 
183 this primitive world. The authors called Fineline I believe. Its got something
184 to do with the days of the week or this pretty girl or something. Quite

222   Morby rested behind the rocks catching to catch his breath.  He eventually
223 peeked his head over the rocks to take a look at the carnage below.  He could
224 see many of the ants veering off through the forrest, and the rest making
225 pests of themselves.  Morby then turned to Pheric.
226   "  My trusty old sword....damn.   Well is this how one uses an axe? "
227   He through the axe square into the head of an approaching ant.  Pheric
228 motioned to him that the was not exactly how the axe should have been used.
229   "  Oh dear, it is a hand axe.  Should have told me that. Well, I better go
230 get it then. "
231  Morby bounced over the rocks and ran to the body of the ant, and pulled the
232 axe.
233  " Thank you!  I shall return it to you when I'm finished.  I must go help
234 Dawg ", he yelled.
235  With that, he ran towards the crowd of ants, axe in hand, saying " Backstab,
236 backstab!"
237  " He is a silly chap ", said Pheric to nobody in particular.

239 	Back to the inn at last. What a strange looking six limbed creature.

241 about? I've been out of town, you see, and..."

253 HE GOES OUT AND SEE THE ANTS . WITH GREAT PLEASURE HE STARTS LAUGHING AT THE 
254 MIXED UP COMOTION. THEN HE STOPS COLD WITH THE FLAME ON HIS SWORD STARTING TO
255 PIERCE THE OUTER LAYER OF SKIN OF ONE OF THE LARGER ANTS. AFTER THE ANT DROPS 
256 LIKE A SACK OF FLOWER, HE SAYS "DO YOU NEED ANY HELP MORBY?" AND AWAITS A REPLY.

284 voyeur,thanks again for the more info,this porsfis sound like fun but I work 7days a week as it is to make ends meet.
285 so i'm afraid I will be unable to attend it.the reason I asked about it is that a friend of mine gave me one of 
286 there newsletters which had the beginings of a story in it,it is this that I have used for the start of my story.
287 plagerism probably,but what you people are doing to zelanzy is too! is this the book that has the chapters numbered 1,2,1,2,1,
288 etc. throughout the book? I read it so long ago.
289 do you people have more then one person you make up? it would seem so from what I read here.

292 My drink finished, I noticed that my partner hasn't spoken in quite some time.
293 Must be potent stuff.  I hear the sounds of battle outside and decide to check 
294 it out.  As bizzar as the inn is nowadays, the sight I meet is even stranger.
295 Pheric with a bow, that new person with an axe chattering gleefully, and
296 someone with a stickshift, all taking on a large bunch of large ants.  I must
297 have been drinking too much.  Wait, Stickshift?  I peer closer, yes, it's the
298 ninja in action again.  As much as I respect his fighting, I'd never imagine
299 him.  Searching my pockets, I search for a mini-bolo.  Made for rodents, I'm
300 confident that I can use it on the ants.  Hmmm, I'll set it on 'Dog'. Seems
301 about the right size.......

311 Whisper is in her element slipping through the shadows and sneaking up behind
312 the attacking ants. One blow from behind is usually enough to take out any
313 particular ant, and she is avoididng groups as much as possible. Finally
314 tired of flicking that heavy mace around, she slips it into her belt and 
315 draws on a pair of heavy gauntlets. This will be more fun anyway she thinks
316 as she slips up behind the next ant grasping firmly with both hands around
317 its middle rips it in two. Just them an arrow zips by her head burying itself
318 firmly in the ant she had just killed. Hey watch where your shooting those 
319 things she snarls at one her friends from the inn. Apprentice, why don't
320 you put a star spell are something, so that we can see what's going on a 
321 little better. Besides it should make plenty of shadows and you know how
322 effective that will make me.

353 BUILDING, PARTIALY LIGHTED.  HE NOTICED THAT IF HE WALKED DIRECTLY TOWARD IT, ALL THE LIGHTS WOULD GO OUT AND IT WOULD APPEAR 
354 JUST AS EMPTY AND DESERTED AS IT HAD DURING THE DAY.  REALIZING THIS HE WORKED HIS WAY CLOSER BY INDERECTLY CIRCLING IT.  WHEN
355 HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SAME STREET FROM IT AND SAFELY HIDDEN IN SHADOWES, HE CAUTIOSLY TURNED TOWARD IT AND WATCHED.
356   IN A WINDOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR HE COULD SEE A VERY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG HUMAN FEMALE GETTING UNDRESSED AND READY FOR BED.  SHE 
357 LEFT THE CURTAINS OPEN WITH APPEARENT UNCONCERN.
358   HE WAITED UNTIL SHE HAD TURNED AWAY AND THEN QUICKLY CROSSED THE STREET AND RUSHED THE DOORWAY AND FIRST FLIGHT OF STEPS.  
359 THE HALL LIGHTS WERE ON AND THE PLACE HAD A VERY LIVED-IN IF SOMEWHAT RUNDOWN APPEARANCE.
360   CAUTIOSLY HE APPROACHED THE DOOR HE JUDGED TO OPEN ON THE ROOM HE HAD OBSERVED FROM BELLOW.  SO FAR EVERYTHING SEEMED OK.  
361 BY THE TIME HE FIGGURED OUT THE LATCH MECHANISM OF THE DOOR HOWEVER (YOU TURN A KNOB!), THE LIGHTS HAD EXTINGUISHED AND 
362 SNOWRUNNER NEARLY FELL THROUGH A HOLE IN THE DRY ROTTED FLOORBOARDS OF THE LANDING.  EVERYWARE THERE WERE SCORCH MARCKS ON 
363 WALLS AND CEALING.  DREAMTOUCHER HAD 'BARROWED' ONE OF THE LIGHTS FROM THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR THING AND TRIED TURNING IT ON 
364 THE WAY HE HAD SEEN THE OTHERS DO.  IN THE ROOM WHICH HAD SEEMED OCCUPIED FROM THE STREET THARE WAS NO OCCUPANT. HE WALLS 
365 HOWEVER WERE COMPLETLY CARBONIZED AS IF A GREAT FIRE HAD ONCE FILLED THE ROOM AT SOME PAST TIME.
366   THE TATTERED REMAINS OF A CURTAIN BLEW IN THE BREASE COMMING THROUGH OPEN AND GLASSLESS WINDOW.
367   IN THE ROOM WAS ONLY AN IRON BEDSPRING WITH A LAYER OF MOLD ON TOP THAT MAY ONCE HAVE BEEN A MATTERESS.  IN ONE CORNER STOOD
368 
369 A WOODEN DRESSER AND IN THE TOP DRAWER OF THIS HE FOUND A FADDED PICTURE OF THE FEMALE HE HAD SEEN AND A MALE HUMAN WHO LOOKED
370 
371 AS MUCH LIKE HIMSELF AS WAS POSSIBLE WITHOUT POINTED EARS AND FOUR FINGERED HANDS.  HE TOUCHED THE CURTAIN'S REMAINS TO PULL 
372 IT CLOSED.  IT CRUMBLED IN HIS FINGERS.
373   IN A THOUGHTFUL MOOD HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP TO NAP AGAIN UNTIL DAWN.
374   WHEN HE AND THE OTHERS LATER AWOKE TO THE SUN OF A NEW DAY, A PAINFULL, ODDLY MUSICAL SOUND COULD BE HEARD THOUGH ITS SOURCE
375 
376 REMAINED UNKNOWN TO HIM FOR A TIME.  THE OTHERS THOUGH SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE IT, FOR THAIR FACES WORE LOOKS OF RELEAF AND 
377 FAMILIARITY.

398 when dressed in his favorite cloke(gray velour of course) and sumarily armed,he ventured a quick look outside.an arrow went by
399 his nose,something brutaly fast and black was fliting amongst the shaddows,new people everywhere were battleing giant ants.
400 nothing new,he thought,when will something interesting attack? "ah,a micro-bolo mark 2.at least somebody I know is here!"

453 
454         All,
455                 Recently I had the misfortune of playing a game of " RISK "...
456 I had up until then felt that I was cured of that bedeviled disease ...Hovever
457 I find that I was only in remission , and the neurosis still as virulent 
458 as it had been when I had learned the game years ago...Which brings me to the 
459 point. Are there others who suffer this same malaise for which there 
460 is no cure ? ( Barring global domination -which is only temporary- )
461 If so may I say you are not alone ...and further suggest a game ? 
462 ( for the benefit of those so afflicted ) 
463         Unfortunatly this electronic medium precludes the bombastic nature
464 of the game, gone are the subtle temporary alliances, overt strategic threats
465 and covert diplomatic understandings. In essence the game would lack 
466 the social interaction that I find so addictive. 
467         So .... If there other like minded closet generals may I suggest a 
468 small pub on the southwest side that offers 33 fine ales on tap in a 
469 low keyed atmosphere not unlike the Inn we so often frequent.  At a time 
470 yet to be determined ...........
471         Any and all comments ,suggestions, criticisms - etc. are welcomed 
472

475 Alex:sure,lets play global domination.but seriously,yes I would like a game or  
476 1.999999+e38 I share the disease.two problems though,I do not play with normal 
477 rules.I have been playing for 2 years with another person in the dead of night 
478 every friday night and we have mutated the rules somewhat!
479 problem2)I am just slightly under age,I can get into PC&S fine,and people tell 
480 me I look old enough,but palying places may have to change if I get booted(small
481 chance,currently 18%)
482 Piper:have you ever listened to led zepplins "stairway to heaven"?
483 two lyrics cought my ears,"and the PIPER is calling us to join him" and
484 "the PIPER will lead us to reason" just wondering.and yes,you have met
485 dreamtoucher.he is a single person with only that identity(plus guru of blis)

499   THE OTHERS INTRODUCED HIM AS THE PIPER AND IT TOOK DREAMTOUCHER SOME

501 HIGHPITCHED SOUNDS, SOO PAINFUL TO CANID EARS, WAS HOW HE GOT AROUND.  HE SEEMED

511 PLATFORM AND LEAVING IT WARE IT IS IN MID AIR IN THE INN'S 'COMMON' ROOM, 
512 THEMNAX FALLOWS LORD MORBY.  AFTER MANY UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND TURNS THEY COME TO
513 THE STAIRS AND DECEND.  AS THEY REACH THE BOTTEM, EVEN IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE 
514 CELLARS, THEY CAN SEE IT IS PRECISLY AS MORBY FEARED. 
515   THE HUGE BULK OF DARK CHITTENOUS BODDIES FILL THE NARROW CONFINES.
516   ALREADY MANY RACKS HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED, THAIR CONTENTS IN IRRECOUVERABLE
517 RUIN.  NOT WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE OTHER WOULD DO, THEMNAX RAISES HIS STAFF TO 
518 HIS SHOULDER, REMOVING THE END CAP (WHICH AUTOMATICALY RELEASES THE SAFETY) AND 
519 PUMPING ALL FIVE CANEBINOL DARTS INTO THE NEAREST CREATURE, ALL TO NO EFFECT!
520  OH DINGLEBERRIES!  NOW WHAT?
521 JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJTMNXIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
522 Seeing some of his new friends and neighbors rushing down toward the cellars
523 and yelling about someone ruining its contents, the lazy one, who had not
524 been, up till then at any rate, disturbed by all the excitement outside
525 immediately vanished his book, put down his glass, and set his feet to floor.
526 (God what a sentence!) Not the cellars, he roared! That is too much, let me
527 at them. Rushing down the stairs after the apprentice and the others he
528 was horrified to see the damage that had allready been done. No, he moaned,
529 well that is enough. He raised his hands and bolts of a pecuilar green fire
530 shot from them towards the mass of ants filling the cellar. Each one striking 
531 an ant and ageing it instantly until it disolved into dust.
532 ************************** THE LAZY ONE ********************************
533 Alex: I am indeed interested in playing risk with you and any other members

539 	"Ah! This will do quite fine." The Ninja was hollowing out the

576   Things had not been going well for Morby after his initial good throw.  He
577 had been unable to find Dawg, and he was really being kicked around by the
578 ants.  Suddenly a distressingly large unarmed ant relieved it's tensions
579 By tossing The Ninja through the front window of the Inn, much to his dismay
580   With as much dignity as he could muster, he got up and looked around at
581 one of the members of the group running downstairs, saying something about
582 Cardinal Rickyloo and alcohol.
583   "Tally ho(e)! ", Morby cried as he chased after him.
584   Seeing the ants crowded in small combat spaces stopped Morby in his tracks.
585 Never being a great fighter anyway, he prefered to live of his intelligence,
586 charm,wit and others peoples charity and pity.  Morby just motioned the others
587 after him to go down first.  Luck and good friends being what they are,
588 Pheric and the others grabed him by the arms and legs and on the count of 
589 three, tossed him into the fray.

608 pheric,by morby, the warrior, and others he was notable to get a good glimpse
609 at formed a small wedge of experienced, angry men attacking large ants in an
610 attaemp to save the beloved inn.now that the ants were severely decimated
611 the fighting ants became less and an occasional worker ant would attempt to
612 block them off, but they were easily cut down.
613 since the remaining warrior ants had instincts that would not allow them to
614 retreat(or surrender) the men were forced to kill all.the only way they could
615 survive was to make their way to the queen ant afte they delt with the remaining
616 fighters here.there would probably more warrir ants in the nests but would not
617 attack because they had to guard the nest.pheric estimated that there were 
618 about 30 warrior ants left..........
