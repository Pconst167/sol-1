25 To person contemplating getting a FAST printer.  Epson
26 will be selling an upgraded version of the MX series, to be
27 called FX-80 and FX-100.  The main difference is the speed:
28 About twice as fast, 160 cps.  If you want something even 
29 faster, Florida Data has a ca. 600 cps dot matrix printer.

45 Good news for software writers!
46 A new deal from the folks at T.I.!
47 The good guys from Texas are upgrading the graphics section of the
48 TI-99/4.  They will be including a chunk of the circuitry in the 
49 form of a chip in the software cartridge.  If you want to market
50 a game in cartridge form, TI will license the right to use the part
51 in your cartridge for a 5% royalty.  If you let TI do the marketing,
52 they will pay a 10% royalty up to $1 million.
53 Let's all give a cheer for TI for this inovative marketing effort!
54 By the way, if anybody tries to duplicate the functions of the chip
55 with a PAL or some such, they will be be talking to TI's lawyers...

156 To the person with the Videotex terminal:
157  What were you trying? My term prog is supposed to be
158 compatible with the Videotex control codes etc, but all I saw
159 were the commands! (By the way, be careful with those ESC 
160 sequences, one of them is compuserve's remote buffer dump command!
161 I don't want to think what would have happened if you sent
162 the commands to lock out the keyboard or display!)
163 ............................................................
164 Just a question: exactly what do you mean when you say "Videotex"?
165 As I understand the term it is a generic for 'data over the TV, or
166 phone.' Whose version are you talking??

191 "Enchanted forest?"  Is that you again, Little d?  Be still my quaking
192 heart.^.^.^.^.^.^.  Let us talk for a moment of LACK of philosophy, nay, 
193 lack of LONG-TERM philosophy (enduring personal integrity, if you will):
194 I believe it is possible for any one of us who has taken the time to look
195 into himself to reject the short-term and fleeting "If it feels good, do it"
196 concept which bombards us constantly -- NEW IMPROVED product advertising
197 hyperbole; entertainment styles and formats designed for instant, high-
198 intensity gratification; glorification of celebrity status; planned 
199 obsolescence; bottom-line analyses; plastic, body-oriented personal relation-
200 ships; re-election syndrome among politicians; drug distractions; and lies.
201 Once the short-term benefit is but a memory, the impact of that temporality
202 must be confronted -- its monetary costs, personal adjustments, interpersonal
203 dealings, mini- and mega-societal (r)evolution.  If indeed we face so many
204 pains and problems in everyday consciousness, it's only because we took short-
205 cuts in past days that precluded the establishment of a more durable foundation
206 for today.
207 What can be done, right now?  1) Question, with serious intent, what you hear,
208 see, read, and feel and the sources thereof ... is it the truth, an interpre-
209 tation, a fabrication, a distraction, a deception ... was it derived from an
210 act of caring and sharing or of self-service ... is it good for the general
211 population ... what will it logically lead to?   2) Turn off your TV sets and
212 music-makers so that you can listen, really listen, to yourself and to those
213 dear to you and so that you re-learn how to make your own decisions and form
214 your own values.   3) Cast aside thoughts of "You can't fight the system"; 
215 
216 concentrate on the beneficial impact of your own right actions.  4) Seek and
217 support those who possess and offer strong character and personal integrity;
218 relish their acquaintance and join in their pursuit of a future of fewer
219 problems and increased tranquility.  5) Speak up, having thought first.

234 I propose a jackleg servey:
235 
236 Everyone find a local kid, (you know, under 4'6", like Paul Williams)
237 and ask him/her/it what they think about the possabillity of nuclear
238 war.  If you get an interesting answer, report your findings.

244 Dear B.A.D.
245  Videotext is the generic term. Videotex & VIDTEX are
246 copyrighted trademarks for a couple of types of terminal &
247 software respectively. The Videotex terminal uses a version
248 of the VIDTEX software in ROM. I'm using TRS-80 VIDTEX (3.3)
249 and if you're interested I can describe the ESC sequences etc
250 that it uses (VIDTEX is also available for Apple, IBM, CP/M &
251 possibly others).
252 ...............................Leonard Erickson...............
253 Phantom Glitch:  Honestly, I question your serious intent with the 'local
254 kids'.  Why not teach them to discipline their minds (to avoid becoming dolts
255 and mental midgets, to quote a phrase) instead of exercising their mouths.
256 Your "survey" sounds to me like a tongue-in-cheek copy of what Channel 6 is
257 undoubtedly listing in their FCC report card as "public service effort".
258 On second thought, Alan Funt is approaching retirement...  Sarcasm often
259 fails for lack of clear intent.

266 From what I've read, VIDEOTEX is the generic term, while 
267 VIDEOTEXT was the trademarked term.  I remember this because
268 when I read the article, this seemed unusual.  Unfortunately,

276 Maybe it's the phone line or your modem? I've seen a lot of
277 complaints regarding bad characters etc on various local systems
278 lately. But I don't have problems with any of them! It always
279 pays to check your system, THEN listen to the line while the
280 errors are occuring, and then FINALLY, if neither of the above
281 works- complain to the SYSOP. Most "problems" of this type are
282 just the lousy state of some of the phone lines!

284 Actually, I am serious.  Are there really kids who are scared silly
285 of nuclear war?  I have my doubts, but I am willing to be convinced.

288 TO: ALL    FM:CISTOP MIKEY    RE: PHONE PROBLEMS
289 
290 MOST PHONE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED ARE THE RESULT OF POOR CONDITIONS WITHIN
291 THE ACCOUSTIC CONVERSION LINK OF THE COMMUNICATIONS LINK. 
292 OR FOR YOU MENTAL MIDGETS OUT THERE ITS THAT JUNKY MODEM YOU BOUGHT!
293 ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM IS REAL, AND COMES AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF 
294 PROBLEMS. SOME SYSTEMS ARE BETTER THEN OTHERS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY USE
295 BETTER EQUIPMENT. ITS THE OLD YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR BIT.
296 THERE ARE HOWEVER SOME THINGS YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION. 
297 AT THE VERY BASIC LEVEL IS IF NORMALLY YOU DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS IN
298 TALKING TO A PARTICULAR BBS AND ALL THE SUDDEN ITS GIVING YOU PROBLEMS.
299 THIS SIMPLY MEANS YOU GOT A BAD CONNECTION. THERE IS NOTHING UNUSUAL
300 THERE ARE MILLIONS OF POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS OUT THERE, AND NOT ALL OF
301 THEM CAN BE PERFECT DESPITE ALL OF MA BELLS EFFORTS TO TRY AND KEEP
302 THEM UP. IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU, THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE HANGUP THE
303 PHONE AND CALL BACK AGAIN. THE CHANCES ARE EXTREMLY GOOD THAT YOU WILL
304 NOT GET THE SAME CONNECTION AGAIN.
305 IF THIS DOESN'T HELP, OR IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM, THERE ARE SOME OTHER THINGS
306 TO TRY. MOST COMMERCIAL SYSTEMS (LIKE COMPUSERVE) CONNECT THEIR COMPUTERS
307 TO THE LINES VIA DATA JACKS. BASICLY WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THE PHONE
308 EXCHANGE CANNOT HAVE A SIGNAL STRONGER THEN -12DB AT THE EXCHANGE. WHAT
309 THE DATA JACK IS FOR IS TO ADJUST THE TRANSMIT SIGNAL STRENGTH SO THAT
310 IT IS AS STRONG AS POSSIBLE (IE -12DB AS MEASURED AT THE EXCHANGE).
311 US POOR OL' PRIVATE TYPES THOUGH CAN'T AFORD THE COST OF THE 'COMPUTER'
312 LINE SO WE HAVE TO GO WHAT IS CALLED A 'PERMISIVE' CONNECTION. BASICLY THIS 
313 IS THE REGULAR PHONE LINE YOU GET WITH YOU TELEPHONE, BUT YOU ARE RESTRICTED
314 TO A TRANSMIT LEVEL OF NO MORE THEN -9DB AT YOUR TRANSMITTER. THIS IS DONE 
315 BECAUSE THEY FIGURE THAT NO MATER WHERE THE PHONE LINE IS OR HOW LONG IT IS
316 THAT THIS TRANSMIT LEVEL WILL NOT EXCEDE THE -12DB LIMIT AS MEASURED AT THE
317 EXCHANGE. WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU IS A MUCH LOWER SIGNAL LEVEL AS MEASURED 
318 AT YOUR END WHEN YOU CALL SYSTEMS SUCH AS THIS ONE, AND THAT MEANS THAT 
319 THERE IS A GREATER CHANCE OF PROBLEMS OCCURING. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT
320 CAN OCCUR AS HAPPENED WITH THE OLD BWMS LINE WAS THAT IT WAS SO FAR OUT
321 IN THE STICKS THAT BY THE TIME THE SIGNAL GOT TO THE EXCHANGE IT WAS VERY
322 WEAK WHICH WAS A SOURCE OF PROBLEMS FOR MANY CALLERS. ALSO THESE LONG LINES
323 TEND TO BE SOMEWHAT UNBALANCED WHICH AGRAVATES THE PROBLEM (ESPESIALLY WITH
324 DATA TRANSMISSIONS). THERE IS LITTLE THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS SINCE
325 WE ARE LIMITED BY WHAT THE FCC WILL ALLOW US TO DO ON THE PERMISSIVE
326 CONNECTION. (SOME HAVE GONE AHEAD AND BOOSTED THE LEVEL ANYWAY WHICH IS
327 OK AS LONG AS NOBODY CATCHES YOU AND YOU DON'T MESS UP THINGS FOR OTHER 
328 PEOPLE.
329 OK, SO WE ARE STUCK WITH THE SITUATION, WHAT CAN WE DO TO AT LEAST IMPROVE ON
330 WHAT WE GOT? WELL, NOT COUNTING POOR MODEMS, ONE OF THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS
331 ENCOUTERED IS NOISE AND DISTORTION CAUSED BY THE CARBON MIC IN THE TELEPHONE
332 YOU ARE USING (THIS IS ASSUMING YOU ARE USING AN ACCOUSTIC COUPLER SINCE 
333 OF COURSE DIRECT CONNECTS DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM). IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE THIS
334 PROBLEM, IT CAN TEMPORARILY IMPROVED BY BANGING THE MIC END OF YOUR PHONE
335 (THE END THE CORD COMES OUT OF) AGAINST A HARD SURFACE (LIKE MY HEAD) A FEW
336 TIMES THIS SHAKES UP THE CARBON GRANUALS IN THE MIC WHICH DISTRIBUTES THEM
337 MORE EVENLY AND HOPEFULLY REDUCING THE DISTORTION A BIT. IF THIS
338 IS A CONTINUING PROBLEM, YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE SOME MORE SERIOUS ACTION
339 THROWING IT OFF THE NEAREST BRIDGE AND GETTING YOURSELF A DECENT 
340 DIRRECT CONNECT MODEM. BARRING THIS, YOU CAN GO A LONG WAY BY 
341 REPLACING THE CARBON MIC IN YOUR PHONE WITH A CAPACITOR (OR CONDENSOR) MIC
342 NOVATION MAKES A GOOD ONE. TRY COMPUTERLAND , NORVAC, OR ONE OF
343 THE MAILORDER OUTFITS OR BUY IT DIRECTLY FROM NOVATION THEY COST $9.95
344 AND ARE WORTH EVERY PENNEY. SAY, P.G. HOW ABOUT WRAM CARRYING
345 THE NOVATION SUPERMIC? NOBODY AROUND TOWN SEEMS TO KEEP THE BUGGERS
346 IN STOCK. I HAD TO GET MINE FROM PRIORITY ONE ELECTRONICS.
347 WELL, I HOPE THIS IMPROVES YOU PROBLEM, OR AT LEAST HELPS YOU UDERSTAND IT.
348 ***** CISTOP MIKEY IN AN ASSITIVE PHASE ***** 10 FEB 83 *************
349 Since I have never had any trouble with BWMS, or any ot the others, I
350 have wondered whether the trouble is BWMS, or on the other end, and 
351 finalyy decided it had to be elsewhere. A common problem with the cheaper
352 modems is low sensitivity. The PCS is very good here.

356 I very rarely have any problem with any bbs, short or long distance.
357 I have a direct-connect homebrew modem with some super-expensive
358 active transmit and receive filters, which probably explains it.
359 As I understand it, a very small change in the signal/noise ration
360 can have a tremendous effect on the error rate, which would explain
361 why turning up the transmit level by a factor of two, for example,
362 might totally eliminate problems.  
363  Somewhere I saw someone selling a direct-connect modem for
364 under $100.  If true, this would be an excellent solution to a
365 user's woes.

367 Did anyone hear of the new TI computer
368 that uses an Intel 8088 processor.....
369 Now what does that say about the great
370 TI 9900 processor??
371 =======================================
372 How many people out there have heard,
373 seen or played with the VECTREX arcade
374 system?...Does anyone know where
375 technical info can be found for this
376 great system.....The future belongs
377 to VVECTREX!!!!!!!!

384 It's not surprising that TI would use 8088's in their computer.
385 After all, as personal computers become more common, software
386 compatibility will become even more important.  Intel has used
387 TI TTL parts on their boards for years (mainly 'cause they had
388 no choice, they don't make TTL).
389  You'd be surprised how cooperative 'competitors' can
390 be when it suits their purposes....

392 I saw the TI "Profesional Computer" at the Byte shop in Seattle.
393 I was extremely impressed with the quality of the keyboard and the
394 display.  I am still leery of TI support.

416 HI THERE P.G.
417 THE STATED VIEWS ON NUKE WARFARE SEEM
426 USELESS DO TO THE FACT THAT WHEN THE
427 TIME COMES THE GENERAL PUBLIC WILL 
428 KNOW WHEN THEY SEE THE FLASH

434 Dear SAC:
435 If you see the flash, it's far too late...
436 The subject of interest is still of interest.
437 I.E. Are there really a whole bunch of little kids whose lives
438 are just miserable because they are scared out of their skulls 
439 of nuclear warfare?  I grant that being scared of the bomb is
440 a reasonably sane idea.  So is being scared of a plane crashing 
441 into ones house, a much higher probability.  I am just curious.
442                              the Phantom Glitch.
443 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2~14~83~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
444   I believe that Mr. P. Glitch was leary of TI support.  We have a
445 slug of TI silent 745's at work.  A recent one we received had a
446 NFG cooling fan.  A call to TI had a guy there the next day for
447 warranty service.  That's a lot better service than I get from the
448 majority of vendors I deal with...
449 AS I HAVE SAID PREVIOUSLY HE WHO KNOWS ALL THE MEASUREMENTS
450 HAS PERCIEVED A COMPLETE CIRCUIT
451 
452 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
453 Here's a rather dull thought, since I can't get excited about computer
454 conjecture and atomic attitudes:  users here may be more concerned about
455 bit patterns dividing messages than the messages themselves.  Not having
456 heard back from Humanism Anonymous, I was...this time at least.

491 Oh, sorry about that.. The doctor says I am very contagious, and not to

493 wastebasket next to your bed, and some Bismarex; nothing else helps.

500 Well now....the person who sent in the file about vidtex demo really
501 belw me away.   It seems that the vidtex info shifted my H-19 into graphics
502 mode and I got the most strange information for awhile.  I pity the poor
503 H-19 user who does not hit "lefthand shift&reset" after recieving that
504 "info".  Have mercy on us vidtex users... those ESC codes can do weird things
505 to unsuspecting users who come here.  Please keep the vidtex sequence between
506 yourselves. And I shall keep H-19 codes to myself.  thanks.
