24    Petrov tossed in his sleep.
25 
26    An eerie voice echoed through his head.  "Petrov...Petrov!"  Before his
27 mind's eye a terrible image unfolded.  Could it be?  "No.  Stay away!"  Petrov
28 shouted.  The ghostly image of two men, Joshua and L'homme sans Parity,
29 challenged his sanity; taunting, teasing, mocking.
30    "You killed us, Petrov."  L'homme said, "you will soon beg to join us!"  Then
31 a chorus of perverted laughter welled from the pits of their accursed bowels.
32 Finally, a serious look swept across Joshua's face.  "Tonight you will be
33 visited by three creatures who call themselves 'bytes', The Three Bytes.  aaiieee!
34 That alone is enough to drive anyone insane."
35    Petrov awoke in a cold sweat.  "I've gotta get out of here," he told himself.
36 Without waiting until morning, Petrov located a garage with a dozen or so Rolls 
37 Royce's inside.  Within a few minutes he had a car running.  "Petrov escapes in 
38 style!"  He wondered if anyone would be dumb enough to challenge the elements on
39 foot.
40    Heading north Petrov wondered what he should do.  He wasn't carrying many
41 possessions, just a couple of his favorite dresses.  By daybreak he had reached
42 Portland.  Driving through the streets he witnessed a stabbing, a robbery, two
43 fistfights, and several assorted acts of vandalism.  "Ahhhh, civilization!"  A
44 broad grin gripped Petrov's face.
45    "What to do, what to do, what to do?"  While stopped at a traffic light, he
46 noticed that the man in the car next to him was talking to the dashboard.
47 "What a fruitcake," Petrov smirked to himself.  With nothing better to do, he
48 decided to follow.

66 The above was stolen from an old Mad magazine. You might hum it to yourself from time to time as you drive. My former
67 roommate is a paramedic, and he told me that the sampling process is all wrong to estimate the actual number of drunk
68 drivers on the roads. His own observation after being the first one to arrive at innumerable accident sites was that
69 something like 80% of all fatal auto accidents are alchohol-related. Remember, folks, even if you're sone-cold sober
70 ther're a lot of people on the road who aren't. I only bring up all of this depressing stuff because I feel that I
71 know most of you, many of whom I've never met. You are friends, whom I don't want to lose, and to whom I wish a
72 very happy holiday season (whatever your holiday-- I know a couple who celebrated on the solstice).

79 doesn't really lend to the  -real-  thinking debates I was told

88 Meanwhile as Rosewood slept, the kid was trying to think of what he could do
89 that would be of enough importance as to gain him access to that litle known
90 group of mega-men know to him now as   U.N.I.T.
91 What can I do, thought the kid, that would be good enough?  {think...think}
92 Just as he was about to passout due to the amount of pain he feels in his head
93 ever time he attempts such deep thought, it produced a fruit of inspiration.
94 The kid staggered his wasy to the kitchen for a cola (cola was his solution
95 to almost any problem except running out of cola) and drank it all in an 
96 attempt to make his head stop hurting. It worked, except now his nose was 
97 bothering him.   I really ought to slow down next time, the kid asumed. {brrp}
98 The solution that had come to mind was to let U.N.I.T. know what he was going
99 to do by  -not-  telling them what he was going to do.
100 If they are so smart, they can figure it out for themselves. Why should I let
101 them know everything anyway...        gosh, er, gee-whiz...  {ad nauseum}

128 Leonard : A little bad news on your 2400 baud modem purchase. A real problem
129  exists with 2400-baud modems and the current signal/noise levels on Bell
130  circuits. Many Bell lines can't handle more than 10dB. The new 2400 baud
131  modems operate at 21dB or higher (A Rockwell chip many use operates at 23 to
132  24dB). I have heard estimates that as much as 50 percent of all Bell's long
133  distance lines fall into this problem category.
134 Kathy : Probably a good move regarding challenge. Sometimes suspicions are
135  better left suspicious. It makes all the more mystery that way. How goes the
136  endgame? Still at 320 points? So close but yet so far. I know the frustration
137  of nearly having the game solved, but being kept from my appointed destiny
138  of grandmatership by one last puzzle.
139 P. Hawthorne: Did you get my first message about the computer network at MLC?
140  Like I said before, I need some inside information from a student computer
141  user like yourself. If your school really wants to get rid of their network 
142  computers, we would like to know why, what went wrong, and what can be done
143  to rectify the situation. Thanks for any help you can give...
144 Mikey : Any sales yet? ha ha! What about this new Sanyo Portable (MBC 780?)
145  Looks interesting...
146 Milchar : I know you are trying to clean up the various valleys we disturbed,
147  but if you could take time off from your chores, I have another C64 related
148  favor to ask. I know I know, not again!
149 Petrov : Accursed Bowels!?! To quote Leonard, Hrumph! Also, did I notice a
150  small reference to the truly accursed Tri-Bytes? Those gangters of the phone

155 Oh goody, now I'm being accused of killing little kiddies 
156 on sleds!  And hunters too!  Maybe even a deer?  As for 
157 your illogical response, I stand by my statement that it is 
158 such.  Your accusation that because I like snow therefor I 
159 am somehow related to all the things you hate in the world 
160 does not hold to any logic that I was taught or read of. 
161 
162 For someone who professes to enjoy life, you sure seem to 
163 exude an enormous amount of negativism.   What would you 
164 like to persuade me to?  Having such a dark view of the 
165 world as you do?  Sorry, no thanks.  
166 
167 I prefer to look for good things.  I would much rather have 
168 the attitude that Tammy expressed, and try to find the good 
169 in a situation instead of looking only at the bad aspects.  
170 Maybe even try to brighten someone else's day if possible.  
171 Or SantaKathy's attitude of revelling in just being alive.  
172 
173 Life is too short to wallow in such negativism.

177 Fred:  Fine.  "If it feels right, do it".  How silly of me not to notice the
178 good things inherently involved in someone smashing my car: 1) the body shop
179 will make a fortune 2) I will be taking the bus for the next couple weeks
180 3)somewhere out there another will also be getting his car fixed .  All these
181 things contribute to the "recovery".  How nice...  An enormous amount of
182 negativism?  Perhaps...although I think it's realism...perhaps you caught
183 "All things considered" Friday night, where they mentioned that 247 teenagers
184 had been shot in Detroit--by other teenagers.   Would you explain what is
185 positive in that?  They mentioned, if any of you NET fans are reading, that
186 some of them have Uzis!!!!!!!!!  Yes, indeed, I am enjoying life, for as you
187 say, with people like you around it will be short...

224      I happen to be a devout Murphologist (on top of everything else),
225 but to take snow to the extreme lengths seen on the last disk boggles
226 even my mind.  Do yourself a favor: try to find three good things about the season,without being sarcastic about it (people 
227 who are sarcastis 100% of the time lose friends and fail to influence people),
228 and then find another human (or like species) and sincerly wish them a 
229 MERRY CHRISTMAS.  It worked last week for me!!

234   From Prometheus; Sorry
235   I did not notice your message about the MLC Network set up, and I am sorry about that. Now on to answering your questions;
236 
237   The Network they must be speaking of is a series of TRS-80 Model IV Cassette versions linked together with a Network III
238 from Radio Shack. I can understand why they are trying to get rid of the system.
239   The software they are running it with crashes every time more than one terminal asks for access or a file or something.
240   Which means it crashes routinely, about once or twice every hour of use. So I can understand why they are trying to get rid
241 of it.
242 
243   All of this is aside from their problem with scheduling use for it. With only one teacher from MLC that teaches on it, one
244 might expect him to teach BASIC and such to all the grade levels there. Not so, he teaches only to the 5th, 6th, and 7th grade
245 students, and only an hour a day to them.
246   What's more, he doesn't even teach them, he merely plugs in the disks with all the games and tells all the munchkins when
247 they can request access.
248   All of this combines to make a pretty poor use of the system, whereas the Apples are in use around the clock.

251   Mike? : Are you still around for the holidays?
252 
253   I'm sorry if I am happy, I can only be happy a few time a year and when
254 I am there isn't much that will make me sad.  Well, a few things but that
255 isn't important right now.  If you don't like to drive in the snow or are
256 to parinoid about getting your car mussed up then don't go.  There are 
257 always different ways you could get to where you want to go.  
258   I had to sit in a jam for 4.5 hours and got hit 3 times.  My car is a
259 little mussed up but there wasn't any way to prevent it.  I was going to
260 stay home but I had to go.  I'm not sitting around screeming about a dent
261 in my car, I'm glad it was the car and not me.
262   I don't know if anyone else feels the same way I do but please take you
263 sourpuss remarks and keep them to yourself.  All I see on the news an T.V.
264 is how many people have died or gotten hurt, why can't we have a place to
265 escape and be friends with other people.
266   You don't have to remind me that I did't have to read the messages about
267 all the bad things but BackWater is just about the last thing for me.  I
268 come here to read the mail and meet new people and maybe be friends with
269 someone.  I come here to write my story, I know if I put it any place else
270 it would never get a second glance.  Outside in the (real) world all I
271 see is death and people pointing the fingure and blaming everyone else for
272 what has happened. Why can't there be one place where we can get away from
273 all that and have a good time?
274   I'm pointing my fingure at myself for how I feel and what I didn't do or
275 should've done, this is one of the last things in my life.  I don't even
276 know why I call here, I have gotten a lot of praise and I thank all of you
277 who wrote to me(!), I'm going to leave, this is my lasy message here.  I
278 don't have to read the hate towards me and what I am here, I can just turn
279 on the T.V and get the same.
280   Sorry for this long message.  I'm not tryng to make a dramatic exit or
281 anything like that, please don't see it that way.  Thanks for the good 
282 times on Backwater.

291   From Prometheus; On again
292   At MLC we have four apples which are very versatile and used by about everyone ijn the school. Especially the munchkins.
293   Whereas the TRS-80's are rarely used by anyone. This is not the fault of the computers, it is just that there is no storage
294 for the TRS-80's without the aforementioned Network III software. Which is terrible for everything it was designed to do.
295 
296   I promised a person that I would teach them at least proficiency in BASIC and give them a simple understanding of primary
297 parts in a computer configuiration like the TRS-80'S.
298   I can not use the Apples because they are so much in demand that I can't get my hands on them for a single period, much less
299 every day.
300   If I remember correctly, that is why we got the TRS-80's in the first place. And yet, more people learned BASIC when we had
301 only a Decwriter terminal than have learned BASIC from MLC instructors,.
302   I might never stop talking if left alone with this terminal, so ask MiG for my phone number and call me voice. That is prob-
303 ably the best way to impart all this information.
304 
305   Sondargaard; My, there seems not to be a response to your statement. Perhaps it is too commonly beleived to be much fun. Oh
306 well, perhaps at the next PorSFiS or so...
307   Man in Gray; I found out why are being left in the dark so much, there is some freak at the Federal Building who heard from
308 one of Retch's reports about Kendall, that I and Kendall had a secret rondezvous in Colorado.
309   Remember when I had to head off Kendall and those Federal Marshalls? Retch thinks I and Kendall were planning a secret night
310 in the Observatory.
311 
312   At least I'll have fun scaring the Daylights out of Retch for a while. Wait till I show him my copies of those pictures we
313 got from Courtenay...
314   Tammy; This might seem as if you are an afterthought, but I wanted to figuire out what I was going to say to you.
315   I am not sure why you think people hate you, no one hates you as far as I know. I like you, Sondargaard likes you, and so
316 does everyone else who has expressed an opinion about you to me. So don't think we don't want you here. I enjoy having you
317 here, and you have made a friend after all.
318 
319   To those who wonder what to call Star Trek fans in general; Actually there are two classifications of Trek fan. Trekkies and
320 Trekkers. And what is the difference you ask? A trekkie is someone loosly affiliated with the Star Trek shows, and movies.
321   A Trekker is someone to whom Star Trek is very much a part of their lives. Someone who usually tries to know more than most
322 people about the Star Trek universe.
323   I number myself among the ranks of Trekkers, simply because Star Trek is a major part of my life, and I definately try to
324 know more than most people about the series. What is regulation 46A you ask? I'll tell you...

352 Things sure don't change much do they.  I haven't logged on here for just 
353 about six months and it looks the same.  People yelling at people about the
354 most minor things that could ever go wrong.  Have a merry merry christmas
355 and a very happy new year!  I don't like driving in the snow but it sure is
356 fun when nobody is getting hurt.  
357 It's been a long time since I was here last, but it's still all the same,
358 just different names.  I am thinking up a story and might enter it in a 
359 couple days.  
360 Tammy -:- if you are reading this, give me a call.  We could work on your
361 story a little more.  Or we could just talk and share christmas happiness.
362 GRemember a week ago?  Maybe we could do something like that again, it sure
363 would be fun and it could chear you up!

367 Luingil:  In answer to your question about my "promotion": "Robin" and I are
368   not the same person, as I'm sure he'd be happy to verify...
369 Tammy:  True, BWMS 'tis an escape from the real world for many of us, and sorry
370   am I indeed if I have caused you distress.  I urge you to reconsider...if you
371   would enter that story you keep promising, why, there'd be no room on the 
372   disk for us "realists", would there?  So why don't you put on a  and enter
373   it, hmmmm?  I wish that I could look on being hit as cheerfully as you do,
374   but...  Take care, and do have a Merry Christmas, okay?
375                                                           "Batman"
376                                                                               
377 where have you been Batman, some of her story has already been put on.
378 Wake up.
379 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
380 L'homme: Why would I be using AT&T (_NOT_ *BELL* anymore!) Long Lines? 
381   Most of my calls are either local or thru private nets like CIS & Telenet
382 Thus the noise problem is somewhat different. 
383         Anyway, I don't HAVE to run at 2400, 1200 or even 600 will do 
384 sometimes.
385 Batman: "Your problem is obvious" (you have seen the poster?)
386         More seriously, whenever someone says "snow" or "look on the bright
387 side" you seem to relive the accident! This is not logical, nor is it 
388 "sane". (I do not say it is INsane, just UNsane. there is a difference).
389         The problem is NOT the snow, it is the DRIVERS. Back home, most 
390 people wouldn't have even bothered to put on the snow tires for light 
391 snowfall like that! But in Portland, if you say "snow" all the drivers 
392 panic!
393         ICE is hard to drive on, but snow isn't much harder than heavy rain
394 as far as driving goes.
395         I would suggest looking over your previous comments. Or, better 
396 yet, having a friend do so. It is rather difficult NOT to take most of
397 them as PERSONAL ATTACKS! Remember, all WE have to go on are the WORDS.
398 No vocal tones, facial expressions, etc. Thus it is far to easy to come
399 across much heavier than intended.
400           (Just a friendly warning!)
401 PS what (if anything) does your control character border look like on 
402 YOUR display? I'm amazed that it hasn't given anyone's equipment fits yet!

405   I hope everyone had a good time while I was gone for a few days?
406   From the looks of things, everyone did.  MERRY CHRISTMAS and
407   I'm glad you are in a good mood TAMMY.

411 L'homme: I'm afraid to ask.  I'd give you a call to-morrow but I'm afraid that I've lost your home number.  By the by,
412 did mixing multi-color and hi-res work?
413 +++++++++++++
414 Commodore users: Who are you?  Does anyone want to 'fess up that they're using (gasp, shudder) a 64?  I know Alex, 
415 Mad Max, and MiG (on occasion) use 64s, but is there anyone else here?
416 +++++++++++++
417 I woke early.  There was little to do in the morning except eat breakfast, and feed Camille.  She was in wonderful
418 shape.  I saddled her and placed my equipment upon her back, gently.
419 I mounted.  Camille sprang into the air with all the force a Griffon could muster.  Once we had circled about a few
420 times above the tower (Celene was lovely this time of year), we began to pick up speed.  We headed out for empty sky.
421 The lands below slipped past as we flew.  Fields, farms, and forests one by one fell back behind us.  We were ready.
422 I hurled a sphere before us with all my might.  Suddenly, it exploded, emitting a ring of violet light that spread
423 farther and farther apart.  It was through this ring that we flew.
424 The change was abrupt.  No longer were we in the sunny lands of Celene, but in the wintery hills just south of the Inn.
425 I was tempted to stop for a bit and chat, but I knew that if I did I would be delayed by hours.  I turned toward the 
426 Nor-gate, instead.
427 The nightmares and horrors of the marsh below were lost under its white covering.  I passed the point were a manticore
428 had attacked us and did not give it a second thought.  How peaceful the land is when it is slumbering so, I thought.

432 "If it feels right do it"?  Hmm, it has been a while since 
433 I have heard that worn out phrase.  
434 
435 Exactly what do you mean in regard to the statement above?  
436 If you presume that I somehow enjoy doing all the things 
437 you so blithly accuse me of, you are sadly mistaken.  I do 
438 enjoy life, and yes, if sitting back and watching a good 
439 movie with a warm cup of cocoa feels good to me I do it.  
440 But I hardly see how that provides you with any reason to 
441 accuse me of running around wreaking mayhem upon the world 
442 at large.
443 
444 You still haven't explained to me why you think that just 
445 because I enjoy snow that somehow you have come to the 
446 conclusion that I enjoy smashing up cars.  (Or more 
447 particularly, I gain the distinct impression that you 
448 think I smashed yours.)  Really now, all this because I 
449 presented my sentiments that I like snow.  
450 
451 As for the good aspects of your experience, consider that 
452 you could have been in the car when it happened and got 
453 hurt, or killed.  Or it might have been you who smashed 
454 into someone else.
455 
456 Realism?  Hardly.  
457 
458 Negativism is seeing the starving people in Ethiopia and 
459 bitching that no one is doing anything about it.
460 
461 Realism is doing like Evergreen airlines and recognizing 
462 that you can do something about it, how little it may be, 
463 and doing it.
464 
465 Optimism is thinking that somehow you can eliminate the 
466 starvation. 
467 
468 Fanaticism is thinking that you can eliminate all the 
469 starvation in the world.

473 L'homme: No not yet, having problems, marketing manager doesn't 
474 like it, so is not impressed about carrying it in the product line.
475 Sigh... (I'm working on him, but I don't hold out much hope.)
476 p.s. it is the 775, not 780. It is a  sort of IBM look alike like the T1000.
477 almost, but not quite just enough differences to cause headaches. What do
478 these people have against DMA anyway. Sheesh.
479 Luingil: Nice poem.
480 Tammy: Yes, I am still around, but I haven't had much time to be on BWMS
481 lately. It gets to be very hectic around this time of year.
482 Don't let one bad apple ruin your whole life! Just remember that for every
483 joker like him, there are a hundred others who are nice and don't hate you.
484 It is your decision to come or go, but no one is forcing you out. If you
485 don't feel like inputting anything for a while, then just lurk for a while
486 no one will know you are there, and you can still watch things happen.
487 Then when the urge to write comes again, you can do it.
488 
489 PAM: Are you still around, or have you gone south for the winter? Hello?
490 Anybody home? Oh well, I guess she'll be back when she's ready.
491 Anybody else: Have I missed anyone who asked a question? If so ask again,
492 maybe I'll see it and remember to answer next time.
493 Snow thing: I don't care much for driving in snow or ice, but I do enjoy
494 the snow otherwise. It is fun watching it fall covering up the the garish
495 man made objects returning them for a while to the domain of nature.
496 I won't comment further, as I don't care to get into hateful arguments.
497 
498 MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOODNIGHT!

501 Mikey: That is bad news. Oh well...I'll keep waiting, but if things go to absolute zero chance, let me know. I have
502  other plans, not much on the monetary scale, but good for circulation on the IBM BBS systems around the country.
503 (Fido, RBBS, etc.) Also, on your comment regarding DMA, The story from Tandy on the Model 1000 is that DMA is included
504  on the extra memory board, in order to reduce costs on the base 1 disk machine (competing against the PCjr) The Tandy
505 1200 has XT-like DMA support, and the 2000's 80186 has 4 DMA channels on chip.
506 Leonard: Lost your sense of humor eh? OK for you! Be that way! But please oh please stop John Dvoraking me to death!
507 Joshua: So what's new? I guess all of that risking the elements really did you in, like Petrov commented on.
508 G. Minsky: Thanks again for all your help. I am happy to hear more than 'wired' comments this time. Borrow a towel and
509 dry your shoulder off!
510 P. Hawthorne: You have already told me a great deal. I appreciate your frank comments. It sounds like you are having
511 real problems (rather your school.) I know for a fact that the problems with the software crashing can be fixed. Also,
512 an improved cirriculum can be investigated, and something might be able to be done on that subject too. Problems with
513 teachers are another story. You or MiG can leave me private mail on CBBS/PCS with your phone number. Again thanks for
514 the comments. We are trying to go to each individual school and talk with teachers and students about their computer
515 programs and what problems they may be having. It is a slow process, but with every school we visit, an effort to help
516 is really made. Honest opinions like yours help us a great deal. Believe me, I hear a lot of district rhetoric, and
517 sometimes it gets pretty deep. Until later...

528    The door slammed as the tall bespectacled stranger strode purposefully
529 into the room.  The others, relaxing by the fire, looked up, startled
530 to see an unfamiliar face at this time of night.  Some cast sidelong
531 glances his way;  others stared outright at the new arrival.  Their
532 conversation momentarily forgotten, they appeared taken aback at the
533 sight of the stranger's byte-saber which, they could see as he swept
534 his black cloak aside, was slung from his belt over his left hip.
535 He stood silently, watching each face at the table, meeting each
536 gaze with his own, and then spoke in a bold voice that commanded
537 attention:  "Doctor Megabyte has returned to the Backwater Inn."
538 
539    The large fire that warmed the room against the chill air of the
540 December night seemed to grow brighter as he spoke.  At the same time,
541 the front door opened again, and the rushing wind hurled a billowing cloud
542 of snow into the midst of the room's occupants, causing them to close their
543 eyes and shield their faces against the cold.  Someone quickly arose and
544 ran to the door to push it closed, and when the wind had been ushered
545 out again, the stranger was nowhere to be seen.  Speechless faces turned this
546 way and that, searching every corner and possible hiding place in the Inn's
547 lounge, wondering where he had gone, and why he seemed so strange,
548 when after all, Doctor Megabyte did seem a vaguely familiar name and
549 the half-memories it brought to life conjured up images of...
550 no, the pictures would not take form.  As the guests whispered among
551 themselves and glanced around nervously, each one heard a voice,
552 not unlike that of the stranger himself, which seemed to come from
553 everywhere and nowhere at once, saying "I will be back..." and
554 fading awaw into nothingness.  The guests shivered as one, and slowly
555 returned to their places by the fire, still whispering among themselves,
556 wondering many things about the evening's events...

561 Tammy:  My identity is indirectly known to you. Please make contact. Would like
562 to talk to you.  No, you aren't being forced out........Unfortunate that so manypeople feel that they have to attack
563 everyone else....Not good to read nor "listen" to.  I like hearing from you 
564 and hope you decide to stay!  To all: Why in all hell argue about everything?
565 SHEESH! You'd think we all LIVED together! I frequent the Inn to get away
566 from such dross which I come across almost daily! CEASE AND DESIST! (I'll
567 probably catch my share of heat for this, but that's ok. I don't mind.).
568 L'homme sans parity: AH HA! Long time no chat!  You seem to have forgotten
569 my existence! If you think hard enough, you might remember me....Seems to me
570 that we had a certain "sporting" event in common a year or so back! Does
571 THAT trigger your memory????!  In any case, you do know who I am, even if
572 I can't reveal my true identity.......
573 ### Leonard: Good to see you are on here as well, and no doubt a few others
574 who are familiar to me......And vice-versa.......
575 "The stranger slowly looked about the room....Thinking to himself that many
576 of those present were friends from long ago.  He rumbled to himself.  It was
577 time for food and then sleep. He had been gone on another journey, even
578 bloodier than the last........Looking L'homme in the eye, there was a 
579 certain understanding that flashed between them........A vague rememberance
580 from a time past......But who might this stranger clothed in black cape and
581 black boots be??????????..........."..
