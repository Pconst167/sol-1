154 Leonard:  I also read that engineers were poor Jurors for defendants.  
155    Maybe it is because that anyone who is not an Engineer is guilty enough
156    of something to deserve the Death Penalty.  Just to hear College 
157    Engineering students tell it, not being an engineer alone is worth 
158    the death penalty.

170 About the weather: it was great. Enough snow to make a white Xmas, and
171 now enough of that, rubout and return to standard Oregon rain. Sorry if
172 you missed it. I got MY pictures, (and only a little wet.)
173 
174 About the question for another subject to rant about: no answer on 
175 economics. (Even the suggestion that all young people simply ignore the
176 debt, and refuse to pay was ignored).
177 
178 Mystics? Do you mean those who believe in things they don't understand,
179 or maybe things WE don't understand? Religious or witching?
180 
181 Just got my update on CP/M from Heath. A real Heath manual, even. I can 
182 read it. Too bad that it was too late; since I'm going 16 bits and IBM.
183 
184 A last comment to some time ago's discussion: in a conversation about
185 freedom of speech, a request for Russian papers seems a little out of 
186 place. Yes, it is nice to know what the other side thinks, but don't
187 expect to read it there: the Reds know the value of propaganda, and use
188 thier paoers for that purpose. As opposed to the purpose of papers in the
189 USA, which is to make money for the owners.
190 
191 When I was in the Army I worked in the comm center that passed all the
192 NATO stuff to the Paris peace talks. We read the top secret stuff in the
193 evening, heard it somewhat inflated on the US army radio the next day, read
194 nearly the same in the German papers; and for balance we also listened to
195 the communist controlled radio Sophia. Somehow they never seemed to be 
196 talking about the same exchange, even if the dates and place names were
197 the same. To find out what was really going on we listedn to radio South
198 Africa. They were not involved in any way, and had no irons in the fire.
199 If the US claimed (in the secret analysis) to have killed 6 charlies, and
200 captured their 6 guns, the radio (US army) said 12, and a mortar, with
201 no US casualties or civilians hurt. Radio Sophia said 1 or 2 jets or 
202 choppers shot down, many civilians hurt by US bombing, no VC casualties.
203 RSA (South Africa) said "viliage destroyed, 1 VC cpatured, with his rifle"
204 Somehow I believe RSA before even the official, classified documents.
205 The Russians were lying, but then so was the US.
206 Or, in other words, if you want the truth don't ask either side, ask an
207 bystander.
208 
209 I don't think the newspapers here in the US are controlled by the government
210 if the large papers (or radio or TV networks) seem to reflect the 
211 esblishment, it is because they are the establishment. A newspaper is a
212 large business, and will therefore be on the side of large business. They
213 have a vested interest in stablility, so they will be generally conservative
214 Don't ask why they have a real fear of electronic teletext.

452 Good Grief!  I take off to college for a quarter, come back
453 to my once beloved BWMS, and find THIS?  What has happened?
454 Where has the INTELLIGENCE (or a reasonable facsimile thereof)
455 gone?  Where have these... these... PEOPLE come from?  (If you
456 say the Cabbage Patch, I'll never come back!)  It seems I must
457 find my black arm band -- the same one I donned when Ronald
458 Reagan became President.
459 ||||||||||||||||||||| Invincible |||||||||||||||||||||||
460 Howdy, all; this is my first time on this system and I've got to say 
461 it's a lot more human than the others in town--particularly PMS--
462 I'm always interested in new bbs #'s . . . can you leave them on this 
463 system?  Bytes for now . . .

465  TO THE INVISIBLE PERSON. I AM ANYONE AND I FORGIVE AND FORGET. WHAT DID YOU
466 DO TO GET THE SYSTEMS HIGH MAN ON THE TOTEM POLE TYPES MAD AT YOU? WHAT IS
467 THIS "SYSTEM PROTCOL" YOU SIAD ABOUT. HI JODY I DONT LIKE KGON SYSTEM 'CAUSE
468 I CANT FIGURE IT OUT AT ALL. I DONT THINK ANYONE HERE WILL MIND IF WE TALK
469 EVERONE HERE SEEMS PRETTY COOL EVEN AARON WHO GOT INVISIBLE MAD OR MADE HIM

474 i can probably find you a mystic of some sort.  what flavor do you want?
475 there's the simple kind that consult the I CHING all the way to some of 
476 the tantric magicians floating around.  let me know what kind you are lookin
477 for and i'll see if i can set you on the path that you choose.
478 --however---
479   remember that in choosing such a path you may also (unknowingly) choose
480 a destination that may not be the one you would choose as the person 
481 you are when you start the path.  -- contact with some subjects tends 
482 to change the person who begins to study or investigate them.  if you 
483 want to continue with this warning in mind, i can try to take you to another
484 contact.  (i passed up this path several years back-- i got scared)

500 Greetings and salutations all.  Merry late christmas.  Merry early new year.
501 Aaron and Dusty... please leave a message for me on PAC BSS @ 245-9405
502 about mystics and such.  I have connections, and want more.  It
503 is true that once you begin down the path, there is no return.  I have
504 acheived many miracles in this life time, and expect much more.  For
505 training, contact me also.  Leave message for Merlyn, or just leave
506 a "comment" to the "Sysop" as you exit the system.  Gimme your real
507 name/phone where I can reach you.
508 As for the rest of you, I've been busy lately, thus my (probably
509 unnoticed) absence after making waves, etc.  By the way, Zen is
510 nothing.  Does that mean that the Zen restaruant downtown is empty?
511 I'm sitting here on the 27th floor of the Georgia Pacific building
512 looking at the west hills right now.  What a view.  Too bad my baby
513 VAX 11/750 is going to be down today (I'm moving her down to our
514 new computer room in the basement).  Enough rambling?
515 To W.G.: Don't leave the fireplace unattended.
516 To Jeff: Watch out for red cars... they're gonna be trouble this week.
517 Sandi: how do you eat out without leaving the house?
518 I gotta go... be back soon (like Friday, etc.)
519 -- Merlyn, wasting your time again with boring stupidity

522 TO RANDAL: YOU NEED NOT ANSWER FOR YOUR IDENTITY IS AS SACRED AS MINE- BUT
523 YOU ARE REALLY NOT FITTING MY PICTURES. LETS GET TOGETHER AND WORK
524 SOMETHING LABELED 'DECENT AND DESIRABLE' OUT OKAY? I AM GETTING TIRED OF 
525 THIS CHASING I HAVE TO DO JUST TO TALK TO YOU.

530 TO YOU KNOW WHO:
531 IS FITTING PICTURES AN IMPORTANT ASSET?  WHY NOT LABEL
532 EVERYTHING 'DECENT AND DESIRABLE'?  WHAT'S SO HARD
533 ABOUT CHASING?
534 To all scum that uses this sem...
535 People call the sysop a double bagger,not only does his family put a bag o
536 over his head but over theres to,just in case the bag over his head breaks
537 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
538 The only way to stop me is to find out who i ammmmmmmm.
539 your friendly neighborhood 
540 i d i o t
541 the moron complete, a stooge that knows no peer, a scum par excellance',
542 with buffoonery exceeded only by his total inability to spell simple words
543 or complete a sentence without utterly destroying a variety of grammatical
544 rules. Why should anyone care who you are, since it is unlikely that anyone
545 would want to be associated in any way with someone so completely and
546 utterly beneath contempt. Would someone do us a favor and sprinkle some salt
547 on that obnoxious little slug? I've never cared for such pustulous vermin.

551      WELL, IT SEEMS THAT A LOT OF THIS DISK HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO RATHER
552 INSULTING COMMENTARY AND PERSONAL ATTACKS, AS WELL AS GRAFFITTI AND SIMPLE
553 NONSENSE.  I WILL BE BACK WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY, BUT I WOULD
554 FIRST ADD THAT A LOT OF THE ABOVE IS NOT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE INN
555 OR IT'S PATRONS.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE MANAGEMENT *DOESN'T* RESERVE THE RIGHT
556 TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ANYONE.
557 
558 [][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]PAM.[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]
559 
560 But the management, probably deep-down, reserves the right to simply 
561 re-format an old DB full of this junk, and mount on DA...What say, Mickey?
562 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Ol' Smokey ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
563 Better yet, Mickey, just stop puttin' on new ones 'til school starts and
564 Ataris and Commodores run out of batteries.
565 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Ol' again ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
566 >SIGH<   SO WHATS A CISTOP TO DO? I TOO TIRE OF THE CHATTER AT TIMES, AND
567 THE RECALLING OF THE SYSTEM EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED
568 SINCE THE LAST CALL WITH THE LIST COMMAND. YET I ABHORE PROIR CENSORSHIP
569 EVEN MORE AND CANNOT ALLOW MYSELF (EXCEPT IN TIMES OF EXTREME AGONY) TO
570 DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. INDEED, SOME OF THE WELL RESPECTED USERS ON THE 
571 SYSTEM CAME FROM EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE SAME SORT. I ONLY PRAY THAT BIT
572 GETS BACK ON SOON TO TAKE SOME OF THE LOAD. (MOST OF THE CASUAL USERS DO
573 NOT LIKE TO CALL BWMS ALOT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HOLD YOUR HAND WHILE LEARNING
574 TO USE THE SYSTEM. IT IS UP TO YOU TO LEARN THE OPERATION YOURSELF, AND
575 MOST WOULD JUST AS SOON NOT BOTHER.) >SIGH<  WHATS A CYSTOP TO DO?.....

591 What happened to the privacy issue? Has it been censored by Big Brother?

594 
595      I FIND IT ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE THAT SOMEONE WOULD USE 119 LINES (SEE
596 DISK A) THRASHING AROUND!!  I LOVE USERS NEW TO THE SYSTEM, BUT I JUST CAN'T
597 UNDERSTAND WHY SOMEONE WOULD NOT REALIZE THAT SOMETHING OTHER THAN JUST
598 <CR>'S OR "EXIT OFF HELP" ETC. IS NEEDED.  AND IF NONE OF THAT WORKS AFTER
599 THE FIRST 20 OR 30 TIMES YOU TRY IT, TRY A FEW CONTROL CHARACTERS, OR HIT-
600 TING "BREAK", OR JUST HANG UP.  BUT 119 LINES USED FOR NOTHING (EVEN THOUGH
601 THEY CAN BE REMOVED) APPROACHES THE LEVEL OF TOTAL INEXCUSEABILTY.  I KNOW,
602 I KNOW, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER, IT CAN BE FIXED, THE WORLD ISN'T GOING TO
603 BLOW UP DUE TO IT, BWMS IS STILL HERE, BUT IT STILL BOTHERS ME THAT A
604 NEW USER ON A SYSTEM DOESN'T LOOK OVER THE HELP FILE AND FAMILIARIZE THEM-
605 SELF WITH IT BEFORE THEY ATTEMPT TO ENTER A MESSAGE.
606 
607      I SUPPOSE THAT, SEEING DA UP TO LINE 591 WITH SO MUCH SPACE REMAINING
608 HERE JUST MAKES ME NERVOUS.  MIKEY, WOULD YOU DO US A BIG FAVOR AND GIVE US
609 THOSE WASTED LINES BACK?
610 
611      I WILL GET AROUND TO THE "PRIVACY" COMMENTARY EVENTUALLY, AS SOON AS I
612 CAN FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT INTERESTING TO EVERYONE AND CONTROVERSIAL AS WELL.
613 I THINK THAT EVERYONE BELIEVES IN THE "RIGHT" TO PRIVACY, BUT TO VARYING
614 DEGREES AND OVER DIFFERENT THINGS.  SO IT WILL COME, BUT MAY TAKE SOME TIME.
615 I ALSO NEED TO MAKE IT NASTY ENOUGH TO ENGENDER A LOT OF "OH, YEAH?!" RE-
616 SPONSES, AND SINCE NASTY ISN'T NORMALLY MY STYLE, IT TAKES A LITTLE MORE
617 THOUGHT.
618 
619      I STILL HAVE 10 LINES TO GO TO FILL THIS DISK UP, AND I'M NOT SURE THAT
620 I'M CREATIVE ENOUGH ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT TO DO IT.  IT SEEMS THAT FEW
621 PEOPLE WANT TO ENTER ANYTHING ON A DISK ONCE IT HAS BEEN RELEGATED TO THE
622 BACK OF THE INN.  I KNOW THAT AARON CHECKS BACK HERE, AS WELL AS A FEW OTHER
623 PEOPLE, SO THIS IS A TEST.  EVERYONE THAT READS THIS, PLEASE RESPOND ON THE
624 CURRENT DISK IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SO THAT I CAN GET AN IDEA OF WHETHER MY
625 ETERNAL WORDS OF WISDOM (?) EVER GET READ BY ANYONE OTHER THAN MIKEY.  OK,
626 ALL YOU PEOPLE, LET'S HEAR IT!!
