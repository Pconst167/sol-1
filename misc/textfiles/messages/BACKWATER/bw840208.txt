21    Smiling ruefully at his friend the bard, the piper agrees:
22 "Yes, I too need to spend more time blowing these pipes than oiling the piper.
23 I'll have these things going again soon and be able to give my attention o
24 some of the other happenings here."
25   With a deft twist the piper slid the slim conical chanter of the pipes out
26 of the wooden stock.  Placing it to his mouth, he ran a few scales up and down.
27 Shaking his head slowly, he twisted the reed out of the chanter, and slid the
28 skean dhu from under the flash on his left hose top.  The razor sharp blade
29 spat glints of light as he carefully shaved off a tiny sliver of the reed.
30 He placed the bare reed in his mouth with just the opening protruding, and
31 blew a short "kaaaaw  kaaaw".  Sliding the sheathed knife back into his hose
32 top, the piper placed the reed into the chanter.  Another quick scale, a minute
33 adjustment of the seating of the reed and he reassembled the pipes.
34 At that moment, someone (daver was the name?) finished telling a long involved
35 story, and at the punch line, shaggy dog hair cascaded out from his table.
36 "omigod!" the piper exclamed.  "telling a shaggy dog story in a 
37 trans-dimensional tavern is a dangerous business!"
38 Swinging his pipes to his shoulder, the piper inflates the bag.  A soft moan
39 comes out of the pipes as the bag reaches its capacity, then stops.  With a
40 deft hand, the piper presses the inflated bag, starting the drones, then 
41 squeezes the bag with his elbow.  The high, thin voice of the chanter cuts 
42 in forming a primitive harmony with the fixed drones.  Fingers flitting like
43 hummingbirds darting from flower to flower, the piper feels out the notes of
44 a song.  Satisfied with the tone of his pipes, the piper swings into a set
45 of dance tunes: pert and lively strathspeys -- the keel row, munlochy bridge,
46 rose amongst the heather, then the sean trubhais.  His eyes nearly closed as
47 he listens to his tunes the piper does not see the pile of dog hair disappear
48 from the table near him.

51 Ok, you've discussed what might happen if you were to travel back
52 into time, but what about going forward. This would eliminate
53 most of the paradoxes at this end, but what about the other end?
54 Would someone be able to use time travel to predict the future,
55 or by such predicting would he alter some factor that would
56 also change the future he had visited?  Or is time not only
57 relative but sort of random as well, so that any future we
58 visit has about as much chance and a coin flip of becoming
59 reality?  
60         Consider also, what if only one way travel is possible?
61 What if once you got to your destination (either in the past or
62 the future) you could only go further?

67 THE RESCUE OF MARY ELLEN CONNOLLY
68 
69 In the New York City of a century past, Etta Wheeler was a nurse and a church worker.  She made rounds through the tenement
70 houses, helping out when and wherever she could.
71 It was in 1873 that Mrs. Wheeler began hearing the stories.  Neighbors in one tenement house were certain something terrible
72 was going on in the Connolly apartment.  Every night they heard the screams of asmall child.  Would Mrs. Wheeler please look
73 into it, the neighbors asked?
74 The reports were too disturbing to be ignored, and so one day Mrs. Wheeler knocked on the apartment door of Mr. Francis
75 Connolly and his wife Mary.
76 Yes, they had a child, they said.  A nine-year old foster daughter named Mary Ellen.  What of it?
77 Mrs. Wheeler talked herself inside and caught a glimpse of the unimaginable truth.  The Connollys had chained their little 
78 girl to her bedpost.  Her body was covered with wounds and welts and bruises in various stages of healing.  She was emaciated
79 from what could not have been more than a bread-and-water diet.
80 Seeing this, Mrs. Wheeler demanded that the child be turned over to her. The Connollys told the nurse to mind her own 
81 business and be on her way.  For months thereafter Mrs. Wheeler returned to the Connolly apartment, hoping to rescue little 
82 Mary Ellen, and yet each time the door was slammed in her face.
83 Everywhere the nurse sought assistance in the matter, she was refused.  Charitable organizations insisted they were helpless
84 unless the youngster could be brought to them legally.  The police and the district attorney could do nothing until evidence
85 was furnished that a crime had been committed.  And in 1873 there were no laws against child abuse---only and unwritten law 
86 that parents could rear their children in whatever way they saw fit, even if that way were unspeakably brutal.
87 The "meddling" Mrs. Wheeler had one last hope: a gentlemen named Henry Bergh.  Mr. Bergh and the men serving under him 
88 comprised a law enforcement agency.  They were granted police power in New York City.
89 Early in 1874, Mrs. Wheeler visited this same Henry Bergh, described the ordeal of little Mary Ellen Connolly, and begged 
90 Bergh to intervene.  Moved by what he had heard, Bergh immediately assigned two of his best officers to the case.  They 
91 invaded the Connolly apartment and, armed with a writ of habeas corpus, took the cowering child into their protective custody.
92 
93 Weak and hurting, whiplashed and scissor-slashed, the little girl had to be brought into the courtroom on a stretcher.  
94 Spectators, men and women alike, wept aloud.  The judge himself had to turn away, so pitiful was Mary Ellen's appearance.  
95 There, in the middle of it all, was Henry Bergh, his voice filled with emotion as he recited the law which would save Mary
96 Ellen and send her abusing mother to the penitentiary for one year.
97 A warm, loving home was found for the wretched little girl.  It sounds like a fairy tale, but she really did live happily 
98 ever after.
99 And so did many others like her.  For it was the case of Mary Ellen Connolly which inspired this nations movement to protect
100 defenseless children.
101 Even more specifically, that movement owes Henry Bergh.  For when he rescued that battered child from a New York tenement, he
102 did so by the authority of the only extant law that applied.
103 Henry Bergh was the founder and president of the ASPCA.
104 To save Mary Ellen's life, he had to state in court, 'Your Honor, the child is an animal."
105 
106 Now you know THE REST OF THE STORY.

110     He relaxed in his chair, enjoying the atmosphere of the Inn for another
111 evening.  Most of the tomatoes and popcorn tossed at him from the last tale
112 had been cleared away, and some of his listeners had even returned to the
113 table.  "Time, travel, eh?" Daver mused, "well, how about this one..."
114 
115      It was one of those hot, lazy California afternoons when it's so quiet
116 that even the insects don't seem to move, and you can watch the lizards
117 sweat.  I was tossing stones into the crater, seeing if I could get one out to
118 the shadowed center of the cone, out to where she lay under the boiling stone.
119 If she was sleeping peacefully there in Hell's tomb, I wanted to wake her up.
120      I was scuffing up my new shoes breaking loose another rock when the
121 Commissioner's airfoil sighed to a stop at the base of the slope next to
122 my new speeder, showering it with dust.  I'd left the top down.  I waited
123 patiently, staring down at the cracked and broken earth at my feet, feeling
124 the heat soak through my suit while he waved his guard to stay with the car
125 and started up to meet me.  The old geezer was puffing when he finally made
126 the lip of the crater.  I leaned against a convenient boulder and contemplated
127 the best use of my current stone, waiting for him to make the first move, and
128 wishing I'd brought my pills.  Elected officials give me gas.
129      "Good afternoon, Connors.  How's the investigation going?" he started
130 in, loosening his tie.
131      His name was Dinny Cookston, and by the grace of the people of Los
132 Angeles, god love'm, he was my boss.  I amused myself by trying to toss a rock
133 on the ground just under where the sweat dripping off of his jowls would land.
134 "I'm afraid we're going to have to call this one a wash, Commissioner.  I've
135 closed the case."
136      "Now, Jim," he temporized, "We've been getting a lot of heat down at
137 headquarters from some very important people to find Doctor Jaffee's killer.
138 You were even an eye witness to the crime.  Now what could be so difficult?"
139 he showed his teeth.
140      I hate it when he calls me Jim.  "You've read my reports." Actually I
141 hadn't filed any reports in the whole two weeks since Doc Jaffee bit the big
142 one.  I just wanted to know if he did anything in that big office...

214 stands  there quietly in front of him.   "Will you not  speak  at 
215 all?   Why  do  you  torture me thus?   Have  I  offended  thee?"  
216 Frustration,  concern,  and sorrow pass through his mind,  though 
217 worry  is above them all.  Why does she not speak?  Has his  dark 
218 manner caused him to lose a dear friend?  Will he never hear that 
219 sparkling  voice and gentle tones leave those lips  again?   Even 
220 greater  is  the worry that she may have returned to ways of  old
221 and lost her voice.   Looking again,  her image before him begins

232 LETS GET SOME MORE CONCEPTS INTO THIS TOPIC. FIRST OF ALL THE CONCEPT OF
233 TACHYONS AND TARDYONS. THE TARDYONS ARE ALL MATTER AS WE KNOW IT. THEY ALWAYS
234 TRAVEL AT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT. TACHYONS ARE PARTICLES
235 THAT TRAVEL ABOVE THE SPEED OF LIGHT. IF WE BELIEVE DOC EINSTIEN, THESE 
236 F-T-L PARTICLES MOVE BACKWARD IN TIME.
237 NOW CONSIDER THE BLACK HOLE. NO PARTICLES MOVING THE SPEED OF LIGHT OR
238 LESS CAN ESCAPE INSIDE THE EVENT HORIZON. HOW ABOUT TACHYONS? CAN THEY GET OUT?
239 IF THEY CAN, IS IT NOT FEASIBLE THAT ALL MATTER ENTERING A BLACK HOLE IS
240 CONVERTED TO IT'S TACHYON EQUIVALENT? GOING BY THE ABOVE, WE NOW MOVE BACK
241 IN TIME. THUS WE CAN USE BLACK HOLES TO TRAVEL BACK IN TIME. WHEN WE REACH THE
242 PROPER TIME, WE GO THROUGH A WHITE HOLE(QUASARS OR PULSARS?) AND CONVERT TO
243 NORMAL MATTER. TWO PROBLEMS OCCURR, THOUGH. WE CAN'T MOVE FOWARD AT FASTER 
244 THAN NORMAL RATE. TO RETURN TO YOUR TIME YOU MUST TRAVEL BACK THROUGH THE
245 BIRTH OF THE UNIVERSE, OVER TO THE END, AND BACK TO YOUR OWN TIME. THIS ASSUMES
246 THAT TIME IS CYCLIC, OF COURSE. IF IT IS NOT, WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
247 THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT WE CAN'T GET THORUGHT THE EVENT HORIZON OF A BLACK
248 HOLE WITHOUT BEING PULVERIZED BY THE TIDAL FORCES. THIS HOWEVER IS A MINOR
249 PROBLEM CONSIDERING THE ORIGIONAL THEORY.

251 THIS BRINGS SOME PSEUDO-SCIENTIFIC FACTS INTO THE AREA, SO LET'S KEEP

262 The piper swung the pipes from his shoulder and turned to the group deep in
263 scientific and pseudo-scientific speculation.
264 "Gentlemen.  Should you be silly enough to actually want to experiment with
265 non-subjective time travel, the basic mechanism is much simpler than a black
266 hole.  I believe that Hawking's work is responsible for the calculation --
267 at any rate all you need is 1/4 solar mass formed into a rod longer than it
268 is wide rotating at ten thousand rpm.  I don't have access to the information
269 at this moment, but under enough duress could probably find it.  Oh-- I think
270 the dimensions are important, too.  You will probably have to use some form
271 of degenerate matter to get the mass small enough.  You navigate by the vector
272 of your approach.
273 Another thing -- you needen't worry too much about paradoxes--
274 they presuppose a cause-effect relationship.  Hawking also showed that in the
275 presence of an event horizon such as surrounds a black hole, causation is 
276 void -- anything can happen.  Philosophically, the mass of the universe is 
277 close to sufficient to cause it to close.  If indeed it does close, we are 
278 within an event horizon..."
279 
280 Smiling the piper winded his pipes and began a traditional set .. a march 
281 strathspey and reel .. the pibroch of donald dbhu, the salmon leap, and sleepy
282 maggie.
283 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
284 Jonathan:I'm afraid that you have it wrong. Einstein never said anything 
285 about what might happen at FTL speeds. By extending his work some workers 
286 postulated the existence of Tachyons. Also, Tardyons do not EVER travel at c.
287 Only particles with zero REST mass can travel at c. Tardyons have real, non-zero
288 rest masses. Tachyons have "imaginary" non-zero rest masses. As for going 
289 backwards in time, ANTI-matter can be considered to be matter going backwards in
290 time. This shows the real problem. You'd better do your travelling in a vacuum, 
291 or else BOOM! one less time traveller.
292 As far as I can tell from the equations, if you got a REAL mass going ftl, it 
293 would have an "imaginary" time-rate. I suspect that it would be traveling 
294 "sideways" in time. (see an story dealing with "parallel universe" or 
295 "cross-time travel").
296 Since many researchers in quantum mechanics seem to feel that the equations 
297 imply the "real" existence of parallel universes (ie ALL possible outcomes of
298 any action at the quantum level, WILL occur at in at least one univers.) I think
299 that this concept may have some bearing on the paradox question. If you change 
300 anything, you just follow a different branch (and thus will return to a 
301 "different" future). If you travel to "the future" you will be going to (most
302 likely) the most probable future. Thus you can't be certain that that IS the way
303 things will happen. Now if you bring info back and start CHANGING things......
304 
305 As for the "spinning cylinder" time machine, to avoid lethal levels
306 of tidal force, you need an EXTREMELY massive cylinder (several solar masses)
307 spinning at a fair fraction of the speed of light. (You also need a way to keep 
308 it from flying apart under the stresses!) Other than that, I agree with the
309 comments regarding it.
310 And yes, if black holes exist, causuality is inoperative!

312 The apprentice walked over to the inkeeper. "Milord? I believe that something 
313 needs to be done about the use of weapons in the inn. May I offer my small
314 services?"
315 ..................
316 To the gentles who patronize the Backwater Inn: Greetings and Felicitations!
317 I feel that we have a slight problem with the few patrons who seem
318 to insist on the use of weapons which violate The Compact. Use of any weapon
319 which is effective beyond the arm's reach of the wielder or which does not put
320 the user's life at the same risk as that of those he attacks, can only be called
321 cowardly.
322 Finally, since most of these patrons seem to be poor shots, they are 
323 not just endangering their targets, but they are also endangering "innocent"
324 bystanders.
325 If they do not start exercising more self-control, it may be necessary to 
326 impose external controls. I find this prospect most distasteful.
327 thank you,

330 ..."You've been asking an awful lot of questions of some interesting
331 people in the two weeks since the doctor was murdered, then you disappeared
332 somewhere all last week, and now we follow you up here.  I need to know
333 what's going on, Jim.  You saw the killer and I want to know who he was!"
334      All I could do was shake my head.  I give in too easy.  Besides, the
335 obnoxious twit really did deserve the truth, just this once.  "All right,
336 Dinny, pull up a rock."  I started.  As he settled himself, making an almost
337 inhuman effort to place at least some portion of his bulk in the shade, I
338 laid back against a boulder at the rim of the crater and pulled out my
339 notebook.  I caught the glint of "evidence" in his eye.  "You're right.
340 I did see the person who plugged Doctor Jaffee that night in the club,
341 but there was a slight problem with identifying him.  You see, I knew he
342 had an airtight alibi."
343      "There's no such thing as an airtight alibi." he growled. "I could prove
344 you shot Lincoln given the right jury.  Who was the killer?"
345      "I looked him right in the eye so's to show hm I wasn't kidding around.
346 "The person who shot Jaffee was Doctor Diane Gould."
347      "Hold it! Gould was..."
348      "That's right.  Gould was sitting next to me having dinner with Jaffee.
349 What's more, about a hundred people including myself will swear that Diane
350 was sitting next to me across from the good doctor when he was shot in the
351 back."
352      He looked thoughtful for almost a second, the longest I had ever 
353 witnessed the phenomenon.  "So she has a twin, or an imposter, there are
354 a dozen possible explanations.  That's no reason to let a murderer escape."
355      "No, it was Gould, all right." I insisted.  "That's why we'll have to drop
356 the case."
357      The Chief sat back and relaxed a little more, and began the lengthy 
358 process of lighting his pipe.  "You were one of the best men we had on the
359 force once, Connors." he grudgingly admitted, then he looked up and smiled.
360 "OK, explain." and he sat back to listen...

381 and Tarn eyes me with a mixture of emotion in his face.
382        Tarn, my good friend, you have not given me any offense, and I
383 hope that my unpredictable schedule has not given such to you.  We
384 spend some of our times in this fair land of Inisfail, from which we
385 derive much pleasure, but the world outside has called to me much of
386 late, and has prevented me from coming to the Inn as often as I would
387 have wished.  My absence has not been of my choosing, but one forced
388 upon me by circumstances totally beyond my control.  My life is usually
389 one of reasonable calm, but of late the shores of my world have been
390 washed by tides of past times, so much so that I haven't even been able
391 to indulge in my favorite pass-times.  I have lost track of what has
392 happened in the Inn, lost track of friends, lost track of life itself,
393 but I hope that I will soon be able to right myself and return to a
394 more active existance in this world.
395         Please bear with me, I have no anger or hostile feelings, I
396 merely am somewhat harried at present.  I will return, good friend, and
397 I hope to spend more time here in this most lovely of worlds.

406      She  speaks!   Yet in his fog befudled mind he did not  hear 
407 her.   Instead  he  must settle his unease with reading the  note 
408 Emer  has  left  in his hand.   Perhaps he has been to  hasty  in 
409 reverting to old times and memories though they are so near it is 
410 hard to not do so.   With that thought Tarn decides to return  to 
411 his  customary place at the Inn in the hope that soon  Emer  will 
412 once  more return with her laughing smile to ease his mind.  With 
413 that  thought he turns and follows the long trail Emer  has  left 
414 back to the Inn.

422 WHEN YOU EXAMINE AN ATOM, AND THE ELIPTIC COURSES INVOLVED, AND COMPARE
423 THESE TO THE ELIPSES(?) FOLLOWED BY PLANETS AND SUNS, THERE IS AN AS-
424 TONISHING SIMILARITY. FROM THE SMALLEST PARTICLE TO THE LARGEST IN THE

451 If you could possibly travel into the past what
452 would you find.  The people of that time (say 100 years ago) are
453 all dead by now.  The only way anyone could
454 possibly travel into an exact replica of the
455 past is if it is repeated
456 endless amounts of times.  Or perhaps it
457 is like a film.  each moment is a single picture.
458 trTravelling back would place you into one of
459 these still's and from there you would 
460 proceed forward to the next.

470 JUST SAW AN INTERESTING ITEM ON THE NEWS ABOUT A TOWN 
471 IN SC WHICH IS STRUGGLING WITH A PROBLEM OF MARATHON 
472 SIDEWALK PREACHING. WHILE I AM AS MUCH IN FAVOR OF 
473 RELIGOUS FREEDOM AS THE NEXT MAN, THE PROBLEM THAT 
474 THESE SIDEWALK PULPET POUNDERS IS CAUSEING IS THE 
475 LOSS OF BUSINESS TO THE STORES IN FRONT OF WHICH THEY 
476 PREACH. I FIND THIS TO BE AN INTOLERABLE SITUATION. 
477 FOR THOUGH I AGREE THEY DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK 
478 OUT, I DO NOT FEEL THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
479 DISRUPT THE BUSINESS OF THESE STORES, NO MORE SO THEN 
480 ANYONE ELSE. THESE BUSINESS PEOPLE HAVE DONE NOTHING 
481 TO DESERVE THIS TREATMENT, AND I DON'T FEEL THAT THEY 
482 HAVE ANY REASON TO BE SUBJECTED TO THIS TREATMENT. 
483 THE PREACHERS WERE OFFERED AN ALTERNATE PLACE TO 
484 DO THEIR POUNDING, BUT THEIR RESPONSE WAS TO SUE THE 
485 CITY FOR INFRINGMENT OF THEIR RIGHTS. WHAT ABOUT THE 
486 RIGHTS OF THE AFFECTED BUSINESS MEN? ANY RESPONSE TO

509 ALAN's UNABRIDGED
510 
511 Now, it's anything goes.  Pornography comes directly into your living room through a cable.
512 Yet once upon a time, you would have had to leave the country to see a pornographic movie or to buy a sexually explicit
513 publication.
514 When Alan was living in Europe, he bought and read a dirty book.  It was widely available there, and much of the material 
515 raised the young American journalist's eyebrows.
516 When Alan returned home, he brought the book with him.
517 And then he noticed that same book was on sale here in the United States.
518 Almost the same book.
519 A censored version.
520 Journalist Alan did not believe in censorship.  He felt it was the American public's right to read even the most unsavory 
521 literature.
522 In this case a Boston publisher, the Houghton Mifflin Company, was printing a laundered version of this dirty European book,
523 three dollars a copy.
524 Alan was outraged.  He brought the matter to the attention of New York newspaperman Amster Spiro.
525 Both men agreed that there was no justification for the censorship.  Alan proposed that they publish their own version of the
526 book in the United States---that is, the original version translated into English.  While the fumigated Houghton Mifflin 
527 edition was selling for three dollars, Alan and his friend could make their no-holds-barred edition available for ten cents a
528 copy.
529 Alan spent a week at his friend's home in Connecticut, working painstakingly on the original translation.  After his eighth
530 eighteen-hour day, it was finished.
531 Alan's edition was published quickly.  In days the book was offered at booksellers and magazine stands nationwide. A half-
532 million copies were sold during the first ten days on the racks.
533 Then, the predictable legal action.  The courts ruled that Alan's publication was to be taken out of the stores and off the 
534 stands.
535 And it was.
536 But by then, Alan had made his point: The worst thing you can do to a dirty book---is try to clean it up.
537 Californians know and respect the man that young journalist became, U.S. Senator Alan Cranston.
538 Before you evaluate what he did back in 1938, you should know something about the litigation that got his publication pulled 
539 from the shelves.
540 The AUTHOR of the original book had sued Alan for violation of copyright.  It had been the author's INTENTION to publish a
541 watered-down version of his work in the United States, because he did not want Americans to know THE REST OF THE STORY.
542 Young Alan Cranston and fellow publisher Amster Spiro wanted us to recognize the long-range plans of author Adolf Hitler:  
543 German military expansion and the liquidation of the Jews.  So they, Cranston and Spiro, published the unlaundered version of
544 world's dirtiest book, Mein Kampf.

565 The poet fell through the doors of the Inn and out into the cool night air.
566 Making a futile attempt to catch his breath, his eyes came to a momentary focus on a young man about to enter the inn.
567 "Don't do it! Don't go in there! It's too dangerous!"
568 "How so, old sot?"
569 "It was bad enough with the wizard and his magic wand spinning in a vacum at 
570 the speed of light. At least we know they just went up to next week to check
571 out the stock market and the ponies. But now there's a fellow in there trying
572 to raise up a pirate crew. What if they tried to take over the inn? Where can an artist drink in peace?"
573 "Sounds like just my night," the young man said as he pushed past the poet and 
574 through the Inn's doors, his sulphrous after-shave hanging in the cool evening air. The poet decided to sleep at home,
575 for tonight.

577 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
578 The piper paused after his tune.
579 Jonathan Chance:
580    Reality is a consetual decision.  The world exists because we jointly agree 
581 that it does indeed exist in the form we percieve.  If we change the agreement .............
582 
583 Deborah:
584   You appear to have a few basic misconceptions.  I don't want to take up too
585 much space with basic physics (and mine is about 15 years out of date) but--
586 1.  The nucleus of an atom is the mix of protons and neutrons.  They contain
587 the bulk of the atom's mass and a (+) positive electrical charge.   The nucleus
588 is held together by *very* short-range nuclear forces.
589 2.  Electrons surround the nucleus, not in elliptical orbits, but in probability
590 clouds.  The shape of these clouds are quite complex, but in addition to spheres
591 you will find lobes projecting out from them.  Electrons inhabit "orbitals"
592 and a maximum number can inhabit a given orbital.  (the orbital nearest the
593 nucleus can hold two electrons).  If less than the maximum number are in place,
594 a tendency exists for the orbital to "desire" more electrons.  If two atoms,
595 both containing orbitals desiring an additional electron come into contact,
596 they can share an electron in a single probability cloud.  This is called 
597 covalent bonding and is the basis for the bulk of organic chemistry.
598 
599 With a wave, the piper walks over to a corner table.  His throat was quite 
600 dry with piping and talking.
601 ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

603 MAN IN GREY: YES, MY LAST NAME BEGINS WITH A D. BUT I AM NOT d, IN CASE
604 YOU THOUGHT SO.
605 I STAND CORRECTED. IT HAS BEEN ABOUT 10 YEARS SINCE SOME OF MY STUDIES
606 IN THAT AREA OF SCIENCE. SO IT'S THE ELECTRONS, NOT THE PROTONS AND NUE-
607 TRONS. INTERESTING.
