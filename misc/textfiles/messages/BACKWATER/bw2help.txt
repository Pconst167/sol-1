This is the command help summary available on BWMS II running on the Sanyo.
The command list changed depending on the user operation level (see below).
Unlike the original BWMS, this help list assumed that the users could view
text in 80 columns and was formatted for that width.

^^ The lines with "Un" were only available to users that had logged on
   with a valid user number.
   The Lines with "L4" were only available to trusted users with
   Level 4 or high access.
   The lines without "Un" or "L4" were available to all users.

There were four levels of access, level zero (null user), which were users
that had not logged in. Level one, which were normal usrs that had logged in.
Level four, which were trusted users that were allowed low-level sysop
privileges to cleanup after unruly users. Level seven which was God level
privilege only available through the console.
