59     Tsilb: How did you come by such a name? My welcome is actually to anyone,
60 even if they don't have those characters somewhere in their border. However,
61 I was addressing that welcome to the person who had previously asked for 
62 one. The person was one with that border. Nevertheless, at the time it was
63 addressed to one person, now I extend it to anyone. Either way, you are
64 included. -Tanya

68   tilean smiled as he rounded the bend... the last curve on the long walk from
69 school and to his home... the last glimpse of all the greenery... at least the
70 greenery set aside from the building of the house...
71 
72   the spires of his father's dream were coming into form... the dreams his own
73 father sweated over... they were becoming realizations... and tilean was proud
74 of his father... and himself... for having a father like that...
75 
76   he skipped up over the curb... bounded accross the dubious lawn... and tried
77 to open the front door... assuming the look of those trying to listen to a tiny
78 sound... the look of concentration... with a glimmer of hope in the odd grimace
79 assumed...
80 
81   the door opened... and swung freely... without noise... tilean bounded inside
82 and looked around... one of the more professional members of the household was
83 sharpening some knives... and loudly proclaimed his presense...
84 
85   "the door works... did you know..."  said tilean... queried and bid...
86   "yes..."  the gardener's hoarse voice creaked  "i fixed it mahself..."
87   "oh... that's great... anything else work now..."  said tilean... only now
88 beginning to question if things really might be shaping up...
89   with this... the gardener took tilean... and gave him an extended tour of
90 the household... and almost all of it looked as if it might work... some of it
91 even did... some of it might have... never could be sure...
92 
93   tilean lifted each foot over the other... flying up the stairwell... the
94 slender metal curves of it betrayed the welding... welding done by his father
95 with his own hand...
96 
97   i opened my bedroom door... and looked inside... the room was as i left it...
98 cluttered with all manner of notes and pages... fifty books lie in stacks on
99 the carpeted floor... some of them not even opened yet...
100 
101   as i left it... father said he might do some things in here... i guess he
102 didn't get around to it... oh well... tilean sat at the side of his bed...
103 and faced an ominous looking console and screen... timidly turning the key
104 which started the system...
105 
106   after two minutes of the computer checking itself... the screen blared into
107 life... blazing phosphor letters of all shapes and distinction... and soon the
108 jumbled mess calmed into a single prompt... and tilean keyed the right word...
109 
110   the screen said it was dialing... and i waited for it to go through the check
111 list of systems i called... to download all the messages... that i might read
112 all of them soon... backwater was first... and i did indeed care for it...
113 
114   although i deigned never to frighten them of me... and always to rival the
115 best of the stories... all of this was done with a spirit of patterning myself
116 on the best qualities in others... and from what i was hearing... it was now
117 beginning to work...
118 
119   even spelling... which the nefarious l'homme checked constantly... everyone
120 seemed to like tilean now... and in fact... they triied to deny what fun they
121 had all had... in insulting who they thought was a twit... but was a younger
122 tilean...
123 
124   promethean tilean... may all of you weather the storms... whatever they are
125 or who they might be...

130 -+-   It seemed to be that storms were brewing, and they were being     -+-
131 -+-weathered by those that took the precautions that would provide for  -+-
132 -+-anescape.     So many people...  So many avenues...   So many altered-+-
133 -+-forms of being able to apply one's self.     Although attempting to  -+-
134 -+-stand still in the myriad of the daily events, this one could not    -+-
135 -+-come to understand that all things must come to an end.  A part of   -+-
136 -+-this one just gazed out at the auburn sky as the sunset grew into    -+-
137 -+-the darker shades of the night... the shades that were this one.     -+-
138 -+-   As a seperate part of this one made itself move into the direction-+-
139 -+-that was coming soon to be, he realized just what it was that he was -+-
140 -+-becoming.  "I'm living out of boxes!  I'm becoming another 'Man in a -+-
141 -+-Suitcase!  Where am I going to end up if I keep this up?" he thought,-+-
142 -+-the words flowing from his lips silently as they formed within his   -+-
143 -+-mind.  The options seemed to be just a shade of  gray  in his future.-+-
144 -+-   "I suppose that living out of boxes wouldn't be all that bad..."  -+-
145 -+-he said with a painted smile as he packed the odds and ends that lay -+-
146 -+-about his bed into just two spare boxes.  "Moving doesn't have to be -+-
147 -+-such a lonely time.  I mean, if I just stay in a box, there'll be no -+-
148 -+-for all this unneeded packing and unpacking..."  He'd like to believe-+-
149 -+-what it was that he had just said.  He finished placing some of the  -+-
150 -+-last of loose posessions into one of the boxes.  Then his thoughts   -+-
151 -+-went back to just how much he didn't want to move- move into a house -+-
152 -+-that wouldn't be in any way a part of him no matter what he did.     -+-
153 -+-   Another thought went through his mind, an odd thought that made   -+-
154 -+-feel that his existance was only a test, a very disconnected thought.-+-
155 -+-   "At least I've got friends don't I?  Sure I've got friends.       -+-
156 -+-Everybody's got friends.  Sure I do.  Don't I?  Yea, I do..."  But   -+-
157 -+-the thought of it all being a test kept haunting him.  "But what     -+-
158 -+-about the friends I've sucked in?  That one seems to be ruining it's -+-
159 -+-own life just by knowing me, being with me.  All those tremendous    -+-
160 -+-created just so that one person could hide it's friendship with me,  -+--
161 -+-just so that none of it's friends will know that it knows me..."     -+-
162 -+-   He then considered remaining the dark figure it was, and just     -+_-
163 -+-staying in hiding in the dark, back rooms.  "At least when I am alone-+-
164 -+-I won't be able to hurt anyone, noone will be bothered by me.  I'll  -+_-
165 -+-just do what I'm supposed to do, and everyone will be alright.  Them -+-
166 -+-with their friends, the ones that aren't affraid of coming out of    -+-
167 -+-and me all by myself just looking at them enjoying themselves..."    -+-
168 -+-   Strange thoughts indeed...                                        -+-
169 -+-   He then threw his clothes across the room in half an attempt to   -+-
170 -+-allow then to land in the box intended for them, not caring anymore  -+-
171 -+-if they landed short of the mark.  "Why should I care? I fell short."-+-
172 -+-   He thought awhile longer about the concepts that contained him,   -+-
173 -+-tossing them around in his head as a juggler tosses little tiny bags.-+-
174 -+-   -+-   -+-   -+-   -+-   -JUGGLER-   -+-   -+-   -+-   -+-   -+-   -+-
175 
176 -+-   -+-   That was supposed to be:   "tremendous LIES"   I missed it. -+-
177 
178 My friends, to some of you this will not mean anything, others know what
179 is going on behind the scenes. It is to the latter that I now speak.
180         Do you of you have suggestions regarding how this outrage may be
181 dealt with? I await your replies.

206 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
207 isisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisisiI'm getting tired.
208      It was eons, and seconds.  The first sensation he had was that of
209 time.  In the last few moments, he had been conversing with crystals, who
210 spoke with their ever-changing structures.  They measured time not in 
211 the dusk to dawn cycle, nor in the flight if season, for these were far
212 too quick to be noticed by such ancient creatures.  They whispered of 
213 cycles of gravity, of eclipses and earthquakes.  They spoke in colors
214 and shapes of all kinds.  When the time came, they knew, and bid farewell
215 to their friend for what they knew would be moments.  
216      He began to sense the beings of decay -- the lichen and fungi.  
217 Thses had proud and powerful ancestors of whom they spoke with awe.  
218 They welcomed him to their plane, speaking rapidly, or so it seemed after
219 speaking so long with rocks.  The lichens laughed at the ancient rocks,
220 whom they thought old-fashioned and stodgy.  He could not stay long, as
221 before, but hastened to his tasks and bid them farewell in their turn.
222     When he had progressed to the plane of the ephimeral beings, he began
223 to prepare himself for his sortie.  He fashioned a body of the substance
224 of the dust, even borrowing from the dust of the ephimeral that layed at
225 rest beside him.  She had been a golden haired beauty -- a quick though
226 faithless diversion for a world weary soul.  If he knew then...but he
227 could not.  The flash of memory helped him fashion himself in the likeness
228 of a man, drawing on those men he remembered.  He caused new-made blood
229 to course through his veins, and remembered what warmth was like.  He
230 soon remembered that he must be able to breathe, and so began to rise
231 from his long-time bed of clay.  The once and future king had returned.

264    'stay away from the lananarans; at least from the old men' was the first thing
265 the prim young receptionest in personel had warned him when glomar drilling had
266 given him a job on Thenalura.
267      'if you listen to them too much, thair fantasies might start to make sense,
268 then youll be stuck in the cloud-cookoo land of that mind thing of thairs'
269      A bunch of half-witted woodland pacifists who sit around contemplating 
270 thair navels, when they arn't raping thair daughters was the way Frank, Lazendo's
271 boss had put it.
272    The shafpenz were another matter.  Theyh shared the Lananatan aestheticl physical sucinctness,
273 a large touch of the unexpected and form fallowing function, but not too obvios about it.
274 Beyond that they were phusiocaly sucinct themselbesl even more than lananatans.  Cuddly, qute,
275 furry - and deadly.  While Lananarans were almost universaly pacifists, the shafpenz were
276 never without thair arm lenth blades, the Snikreshnaka.  They had little reluctance to use them either.
277     Frank would have called the arcitexture of shafpenz town claustriphobic.  To +Laz, it had a feel
278 of coziness.
279     Lazendo's revery was shattered byh a muffled cry of outrage.  in a brick and tile alley angling off
280 to his left, a pair of human-like lananatans was surrounded by a press of belligerant teddy-bearsl swords drawn.
281 Thair bappearant leader held one of the Lananarans, an 
282 adolescent female, by the hair, his other paw, attempting to clamp shit her mouth.
283     For all of 'western' humanities mistrust of lananarans, there was little reluctance to purchase
284 thair teqnology, whenever and warever possible.  No one was permitted to wander unarmed into Vitaroixah,
285 the Shafpenz town.  Lazendo, ignoring conventionali9ty, had choosen to arm himself in the Lananaran manor. 
286 On each wrist he wore an ultrasonic stun projector.  As he inconspicously srt them to noirmal power, continous 
287 dutyj, ixuews ro him ro qonswr r rhw culnxvility of
288 that last line looks like an attack of fat tired fingrs.  to be continued later...

305    The first few moments of the flight were pure exhilaration.  True, the
306 cold air plucked at the piper's kilt, leeching warmth from his body, but the
307 flow of warmth which soon would have ended with the last trickle from the
308 piper's frozen body stopping as the last drops of fluid from a breached
309 reservoir was maintained by the pegasus' body heat.  Leaning far over her
310 neck, the piper sheielded his face from the icy night wind by burying his
311 face in her mane.  His nostrils were filled with the pegasus' scent, speakin
312 to him in a language older than self-awareness of long golden afternoons and
313 the bright sunlight over wind-tossed expanses of grass.  Warmth poured
314 into the piper from his mount's exertions as she climbed higher into the 
315 air; warmth that tumbled through his veins, only to be plucked by the wind's
316 icy chill.  It was if, the piper mused, he were a small pool in the vast
317 current of warmth -- fed from another, and in turn, the source for someone.
318   A subtle change in the pegasus' exertions told him that she had ceased
319 climbing.  The icy bite of the wind moderated as the pegasus found and 
320 entered into a warmer layer of air.  Slowly the piper straightened up and
321 looked about himself with awe.
322   They were proceeding up a vast moonlit valley.  Enourmous mountain ranges
323 reared up both to the left and right of their path.  The valley floor was
324 broad beneath them, dotted by small mounds covered with what seemed to be
325 trees or bushes, silvery in the intense moonlight.  
326   Sailing with her great wings outstreched to capture the lift in every
327 passing breeze, the pegasus seemed nearly as captivated by the scene as
328 her rider.  Only the slight boil on the surface of objects they passed
329 could indicate that this wonderland was fabricated from the aerial mists
330 that the earthbound term clouds.

354         The place was a small cabin on the slopes of Mount Hood, about 10
355 miles South as the crow flies from Timberline Lodge. But more important than
356 the cabin itself was what was happening at the cabin. A small drama was
357 unfolding, the likes of which the flora and fauna of the area had never
358 seen before. The participants of the drama, hardly little to them, the scene
359 had been played out many times before, both in preparation for such an
360 event, and the event itself.
361         Three men in an cabin, straining their senses to know what was
362 happening just outside the door. The three men were of an Elite group;
363 a group known as NET. The history of the organization is not important know,
364 suffice it to say elite is barley sufficient to describe the group; elite,
365 but very very human. Two more people are outside the cabin. A man who was
366 once friend and companion to those inside; his affiliation now is still
367 unknown. The other a women; NET's first and foremost female agent. Her
368 ability to cozen a man who would take advantage of her was well known, but
369 to those who she called friends, their lives were the better because of
370 her. In front of all of them, a man gone mad. Also a NET agent, but his
371 failing only proves the frailty of even the most well trained man. 
372         The name of the man is Fleming. His ability to sway the less
373 secure around him was legend in NET. He had used is skills as a con-man
374 to convince several malcontents in the organization to come with him,
375 and bring back the woman, whom he considered enemy. Gaudy Minsky is her
376 name, and playing on Fleming's by-the-book fetish, she has managed to
377 convince Fleming to take her back to NET headquarters. The man at her
378 side, Kosta, the fugitive from NET, is considered icing on the cake.
379         Ian Machinery, NET's highest official in an organization refreshingly
380 brief on hierarchy, knows nothing of the scene being played out at the
381 cabin. NET agents tend to act as independent entities, falling back on
382 the organization only when it becomes necessary. Ian is a complex man,
383 and his reaction to the return of Fleming, Minsky, and Kosta could only
384 be conjecture at best.
385         Parity, Fellows, and Farley, the three NET agents inside the cabin,
386 had only seconds to formulate a plan, and execute it. Gaudy and Kosta were
387 almost to the waiting four-wheel-drive vehicles, and seconds away from an
388 uncertain fate.
389         Parity knew the dilemma. He had no stomach for killing misguided
390 NET employees, regardless of their current alignment, but he couldn't
391 let the madman Fleming have his way either. Parity knew there wasn't much
392 chance of Gaudy and Kosta reaching NET's Portland HQ alive, regardless of
393 what the book said. Fleming was unstable, even his madness could not be
394 counted on. In his mind, a plan developed. If it worked, no... when it
395 worked, they would be safely on their way down the mountain, and Fleming
396 would be seeing the error of his ways.

411 only managed to get on twice. This is RIDICULOUS! The next time I get on

423   To arm himself in the Lananaran manor.  On each wroist ;he wore an ultra
424 ultrasonic stun pronector.  As he in 
425 conspicously awr rhwm to normal power, continous duty, it occured to 
426 him to wonder at the vulnerab9ility bog vulnerability of the two in th
427 the alley.  Civilized Weapon was to Laz's mind, a most unlikely juxti
428 position of terms, yet the Lananaran power band, which allowed one to
429 quite litteraly shoot first and ask questions later, the invewnyion of
430 of a world of 'pacifists', was precisly that.
431      Most of the shafpenz lay on the pavement, unconcios, before they 
432 they realized they had company.
433     Four did not.,  Three of these hurried a way with the adult male.
434   The fourth stood shaikily, it's snjikreshnaka at the young Lananara
435 n's throat.  Impasse!
436     Attempting to emmulatye yhe detatchment he had so often seen excer
437 cised by Lananarans, Laz smiiled and shrugged his shoulders and turned
438 to walk away.  
439 Abruptly,, a flkicker of moving shadow caught by the corner of his eye,
440 Lazendo froze.  24"of deadly steel wizzed passed, an inch ahead of wa
441 ware his heart would have been.  In one unthinking flow of motion, he 
442 turned and felled the remaining shafpenz.
443  n   As soon as the young Lananatrans composure was sufficiently recou
444 vered, Laz asked about family and kin.  As it developed, her only rela
445 relative on Thenalura wa a co-father nemed Denap, whom she claimed cou
446 could not possibly have been her natural father, yet by humjan reconing
447 reconing, was her legal gaurdian.  Of her five co-parents, only Denap 
448 had never touched her in an erotic manor; indeed, she could not recal 
449 his ever having touched her at all.
450     jHad Laz a better understanding of the cello-op-soco way, this wou
451 would have triggered screaming claxonsin his mind.  As it was, he coul
452 could only display his perplexing ignorance.  Though to his t6hinking
453 thinking, Reli, was only a child, by Lananaran standards, she was pai
454 painfully attractive.
455     Reli and denap had headed into town that morning...

463 To the Person None as Leonard, I don't know what your problem with Fido 59
464 is since I have had very little trouble logging on there. The system has
465 a 60 minute time limit, but that is rarely ever used in its entirety. Most
466 users have 1200 baud, which helps even more with system throughput. The
467 inability of you to log onto the system must be due to 1) computer problems
468 2) extra busy system 3) short attention span 4) bad luck 5) calling from
469 1:00am to 2:00am when the system is busy with Fido Mail. If you have
470 questions about the system, leave a message to Vic Bachulis on any of the
471 local boards, or better yet, try again a second time. Why wait until
472 three for a charm?

514      Awullsu allowed the ribbon to be tied.  It was not a ritule between them,
515 but she felt that it might become one if they remained together for too long.
516      "Wulliso, you must acompany me.  I have been sent to greet you on your 
517 return with Nianque.  It appears you have treated him well.  You must come,
518 Meteu is waiting for you now."  Her words were spoken as if prepared for.
519 She wanted to return the greeting he had given her, but the lack of interaction
520 would be warning enough for him to know that they were not alone.  His mistake.
521      "Yes...  If Meteu awaits, I must not delay,"  were the Guardians words in
522 return.  "I have been away for too long... my sences are not as keen as they
523 were when last I visited. Otherwise I would have known that we were not alone,"
524 he then thought to himself.  He then thought of what might be the need that 
525 Meteu would request him.
526      "We may be alone at a later time," she said in an almost unheard breath.

543   I look around the room and see an empty slate, footprints wiped by a passing

545 not even of fabric softener.  On top is a large red towel.  The room smells
546 faintly of turkey, the sent of dinner lingers, but that is all.  The bed has
547 been made, the sheets and blankets smoothed by some morning hand, looking 
548 almost hard in their tighness, like the skin of a drum.
549   But if I look closely, I can see the soft markings of a lip on a glass, a

585 |  computer developed profile was compared to a survey of the  |

587 |  of the prediction amazingly high, but the computer matched  |
588 |  the assumed names to the real people 94% of the time.       |

598 ^^^^^     As I looked around the emptied half of the Inn, I noticed that the

600 ^^^^^  completed.  Several tables had been cleared, and counters washed down,
601 ^^^^^  but there was missing the gentle touch of the one that cared for those
602 ^^^^^  that visited- even if infrequently...          (This is not easy, what

606      So often this part of the Inn is left alone, so often it stands unused 
607 and gathering dust that has been lifted into the air by the tumultuous and
608 high spirited behavior of the patrons crowded into the cleaner tables near
609 the front.  And so rarely do they look back towards this sheltered and 
610 poorly lit corner that I know that only a very few will see me as I attempt
611 to relieve the emptyness that remains, only the few with eyes that care to
612 see, hearts to feel, the desire to know.
613 
     I find that I've repeatedly dealt with companions with the calloused
614 hand of fear, raising the walls at the slightest sign of intimacy or of a 
615 closeness that I feel that I'm unable to deal with.  While those emotions 
616 may indeed be justified through the hard bed of experience, they still cause
617 hurt feelings to those unable to understand through a lack of knowledge of
618 the basic root of the terrors.  None of us can truly know what happens in
619 another's deepest and darkest pits of fear, nor can we understand the height
620 that joy can reach in another's soul at what we might think a trifle.
621 
622      Looking out through the hazy, smoke filled air to the main hall, I can 
623 see many familiar faces gathered together.  They trade stories, insults,
624 and cameraderie, and those few that I knew would be aware look back this way
625 and wave a friendly hand.  I pause in my work to respond, and paste a happy
626 smile upon my face as befits a good barmaid.  I would clean this table more
627 often, I think, were it not that there is usually so much to clean!
