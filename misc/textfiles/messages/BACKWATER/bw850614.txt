21 museum... What's more appropriate than Gershwin for the top?  Isis has never
22 been at the top before.  Isis likes the top.  Why did I have to go all the

24 Piper:  Sorry to give you the impression I am a professional proofreader.
25 No, I just did it for all of my buddies in college in exchange for beer
26 (those were my younger days) and victuals of other sorts.  Still do it for
27 a graphic artist friend of mine.  I also do translation from French, 
28 Spanish, Russian or German in exchange for reasonable bribes.  The closest
29 I ever got to the pro circuit was knowing John (Transmaniacon) Shirley 
30 who proofed for Ursala LeGuinn for a while.  (namedropper!).  Did I ever
31 tell you how much I enjoy your writing?  I do, and I don't think it's
32 unreadable at all.  Some people accuse me of using too big of words, too.
33 But using the right word at the right time makes for an economy of 
34 language as well as a harmony and rhythm too often missing in our lives.
35 Here I am, being uneconomical, on my soap box running at the mouth.....
36 Come to the nerd-o-fest this weekend and talk to me on remote, please. 
37 I would love to meet you, even vicariously as my circumstances demand.

49      Sox:  While we are discussing plots and infiltrations, I have one for you:
50 I am of the firm opinion that Nutra Sweet is a non-silicon-based alien life-
51 form that is trying to form a very unhealthy symbiotic relationship with us
52 Terrans.  It's gotten itselves into our food in a dormant state, and once eaten
53 takes over its unsuspecting host.  You'll never catch me eating the stuff!!
54      To All:  In case you haven't noticed, you're now stuck with me full-time
55 for the next three months.  The stuff on these two drives is TERRIFIC, and I
56 hope my contributions won't upset the Quality Factor.  So here's to Good

152 !!!!!!!!!!!Political Paranoia Patrol Alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!
153 In case you hadn't heard, there's been a hijacking going on across the 
154 ocean -- TWA from Athens to Lebanon to Algiers to Lebanon..... Am I
155 paranoid, or did I really get the message last night that they sent
156 the Delta 9 force (of the great helicopter hostage rescue, remember?)
157 to the Middle East?  And did I also hear that they did not send them to
158 Lebanon, but sent them into a strategic position to strike Iran if the
159 plane is blown with passengers on it?  Say it isn't so!  Please!

168                   Isis Corollary to the (W)Hole Theory
169 Since we have been speaking of holes and socks, let me add my theory.
170 The combination of current from the motor, heat and motion have created
171 a condition inside laundry dryers such that a micro black hole is 
172 attracted into the field.  These black holettes are of such a size that
173 they attract one (and only one) of a random pair of socks within the 
174 dryer.  The space warp caused by this phenomenon is such that when the
175 sock reappears, it will do so anywhere in the universe that has a dryer.
176 The reappearance of the socks looses a subatomic particle known as a
177 Selectron.  These particles are known to gently nudge BINGO beads into 
178 the gravity feed.  Scientists at Stanford are working on a Selectron
179 field theory that may be able to predict BINGO winnings by the amount 
180 of socks a person has lost, but this research has been labelled Top
181 Secret for fear that the Soviets will ruin the economy by BINGO parlor
182 infiltration.

185      The following is a quote from John Gardner.  Since many writers hang
186 out here, I thought they mighy enjoy it...
187 
188      Like other kinds of intelligence, the storyteller's is partly natural,
189 partly trained. It is composed of several qualities, most of which, in 
190 normal people, are signs of either immaturity or incivility: wit (a tendency
191 to make irreverent connections); obstinacy and a tendency towards churlish-
192 ness (a refusal to believe what all sensible people know is true); child-
193 ishness (an apparent lack of mental focus and serious life purpose, a fond-
194 ness for daydreaming and telling pointless lies, a lack of proper respect,
195 mischievousness, an unseemly propensity for crying over nothing); a marked
196 tendency toward oral or anal fixation or both (the oral manifested by
197 excessive eating, drinking, smoking, and chattering; the anal by nervous
198 cleanliness and neatness coupled with a weird fascination with dirty jokes);
199 remarkable powers of eidetic recall, or visual memory (a usual feature of
200 early adolescence and mental retardation): a strange amixture of shameless
201 playfullness and embarrassing earnestness, the latter often heightened by
202 irrationally intense feelings for or against religion; patience like a 
203 cat's; a criminal streak of cunning; psychological instability; reckless-
204 ness; impulsiveness, and improvidence; and finally, an inexplicable and
205 incurable addition to stories, written or oral, bad or good.  Not all 
206 writers have exactly these same virtues, of course.  Occasionally one finds
207 one who is not abnormally improvident.
208 
209       Hmmmm.... I knew there was some reason I was so weird.  Now I
210 realize I'm not alone.

213     How very odd to come home from school and find that someone has left
214 an entry IN MY NAME!  There's no real problem, though.  There was nothing 
215 wrong with it that I can see.  (It was also quite short and will probably
216 be forgotten quite soon).  The record should be kept straight, however, so I
217 now point out for all to see that the "Petrov" entry concerning Kosta/Mary
218 Lamb was not entered by me.  It's good to see that I (and the Petrov 
219 personality) have not been forgotten.  Careful readers would have noted
220 that the closing name "PETROV" was capitalized while I only capitalize 
221 the "P".  Keep a lookout for a Petrov entry in the near future--Petrov
222 has returned.

229 L'HOMME: Checked it out, and all works well, I think that maybe
230 what you are running up against here is that it is a VT100 emulation,
231 this means that if you want it to be other then numeric you MUST 
232 select application mode. This is normally done by the remote computer
233 (PDP-11 or VAX) via a command string. You can do it from the Command :
234 prompt by entering the command 'PRINT ESC "="' which is the command
235 for the VT100 to switch to application mode. Again, make sure you put
236 the keyboard in num-lock to make it work. (What were you talking to
237 that wasn't switching the keypad to application even though it expected
238 it to be used?)

260 What, me churlish?  Bless your little archetypical mind, Jung!  I hadn't 
261 ever seen that one before. Enjoyable.
262 I get out sometime today, so I am in a very good mood.  Then I won't be
263 bugging BWMS quite so much, though I may be home for a little while coming
264 down off all of the drugs they have fed me.  If you think my thought 
265 patterns were distorted, you were right.
266 I am not altogether sure that I agree with the above comment on reading,
267 because of the often unsure relationship writing has to art in general.  
268 One of the things that the art movements, especially minimalism and forward
269 from there, have taught us is that art may be performed for art's sake, 
270 and need not always carry a profound message, am essage that often detracts
271 from the whole.  This creates a very confusing situation as regards writing,
272 amking the borders between prose and poetry just that much fuzzier.
273 I am reminded of the experiment that several writers undertook (go awaa,
274 memory fog!) for the MMA in the late fifties.  The assignment was to pen a
275 story that would fit on a regular postcard.  All the critics ended up 
276 doing was arguing which was poetry and which prose.  Some of the examples
277 could definately  have been termed conceptualist, even.
278 I know my views are on the radical perimeters, but let me make it clear
279 that none of this is an excuse for sloppiness, verbosity or any of the 
280 other countless banes of our collective literary existence.  (Index: am
281 I up to a 12, yet?)

320 --Words fall mouthlessly without a care.  A child stares at me.  She only sees
321 this image.  She does not understand.  Like grains of sand she falls away.  Her
322 eyes are filled with fear.  Ruefully I smile to stereotype my mind.  And she...
323 the child of my enemy... she does not see; she can not find the heart within 
324 me.  Her blue eyes look to brown.  A dark well of emptiness is what she sees.
325 Little girl, why do you fear, why can't you hear my pleas for understanding?
326 Why are you afeared at my sight?  What might I do to you?  "Take me away." 
327 we say.  And, that we do; we float away.  Our eyes are locked to each other.
328 As you grab your mother's leg, you're pulled away. Your eyes are filled with
329 fear... of me.  Such sadness what you see.  I can not be another way.  Is it
330 wrong to say, "I'm okay. Do not fear me"?  'Cause I'm afraid, too. If you look
331 inside me, I'm just like you.  And, I'm afraid to be.  You will never know.
332 I can not show you how I feel.  You walk away, don't want to stay.  How sad it
333 is.  A little girl can break my heart and fill my mind with fear.--

341 ========================================================
342      The dizzying feeling left as my stomach returned to 
343 its normal position. The doors slid open again. The 
344 numbers above the door no longer were light, now only a 
345 single word was iluminated in a sickly yellow glow. 
346 "Lobby".  Something was very wrong here... I thought we 
347 had started out at ground level in some sort of prison 
348 cell, and here we are on the ground floor after a short
349 elevtor ride. Something about the lobby seemed very 
350 familar too. Stepping out of the elevator, Pam grabbed 
351 my hand, "Come on, let's get out of here before they 
352 come after us!" She seemed to know where she was and 
353 what was happening, so I followed her as she dragged me 
354 towards the front doors. As we burst through front doors 
355 of the building, we stepped outside to be confronted 
356 with a large white marble statue of three playfull young 
357 ladies, a lot of red brick, and a very smelly noisy 
358 white and orange bus going by. 
359      I was so stuned by the realization that we were 
360 back in Portland that Pam nearly pulled my arm out of 
361 its socket when I stopped dead in my tracks. "B bu bu 
362 but how?" 
363      "You idiot, they obviously flew us back while we 
364 were drugged. Come on, let's get out of here!" 
365      We hopped a bus heading east. As I sat down next to 
366 Pam, I began to relax. Maybe, just maybe we actually got 
367 away.... but that sickly laugh coming from the back of 
368 the bus sounded very familar......

453     Instead of continuing south toward Alturas and it's driver's wooded moun-
454 tain childhood home beyond, the curivelinier, hardedged, psicodelic painted 
455 early 70's extended body chevy van turned east, out into the black rock dessert
456 toward Denio.  
457      Carmichael felt cleansed by the uncluttered vastness that streached out
458 befor him: cleansed of the mental clutter and sensory overload of urban life,
459 freed once more of the twin oppressors; stress and mundaneness, he felt himself
460 once more able to see and think clearly.     When he spoke the proper phrase
461 at the town's one gas station, he was led to a combination shed and warehouse.
462 He was told to make himself compfortable thare, that others would join him 
463 shortly.
464      The heavy sliding door was rolled shut on its track and, as he later des-
465 couvered, locked.
466      The interior walls of the 'L' shaped space he was in were unpainted gal-
467 vanized corregated steel and covered with a thick layer of dust as was the 
468 cement slab floor.
469      At the other end of the other leg of the empty space was another side 
470 rolling door which oppened into another dusty 'l' shaped space.  This one
471 however was not empty.  It held a heavy wood construction picknic table, the
472 kind usualy found in national parks.  Thes, though it's surface was deeply 
473 gouged and carved by uncountable generations on addolescents leaving thair mark
474 in the world, was non the less spotlessly clean.  Set out on it was a fresh 
475 salad in an intricatly carved, pollished and laqured large wooden bowel.  There
476 were also two smaller bowls of similar design, eating utensels and condements.
477      Protruding from under one edge of the serving bowl ware it had been tucked
478 was a note.  It simply said: " help yourself! "

481   Within the piper's body a war was taking place.  If you listened close,
482 you could almost hear General Leukosite.
483   "Tenn Hut!"
484   "At ease, troops.  We're fighting a number of containment actions today.
485 The sacrifice of all, even to the smallest platelet, is essential to our
486 victory.  Get out there and DIE!"
487   "!!RAURHHH!!!"
488 The sound of the crowd cheering the general's speech was nearly overwhelming.
489 The ranked troops were nearly wild with enthusiasm, except for one trooper
490 not too near the center of the mass, near the rear.  White cell first class
491 Harold Donevan, WHDC 11032-448643-33093, shrank within himself at the
492 warlike call.
