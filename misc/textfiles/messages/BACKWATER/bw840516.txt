27 How long I had been sitting there fighting the darkness 
28 I did not know, but as suddenly as it came it left. A 
29 calm desended upon me, yet still there was an under 
30 current of tension and fear, for the darkness is not 
31 gone, it has only receded for a while. It knows that 
32 when next I am unprepared and let my guard down it will 
33 be free to strike again. I can only hope that I will be 
34 ready and stop it again when it dares to strike again. 
35 Slowly I regain my senses and become aware of my 
36 surroundings. Opening my eyes, I see a figure standind 
37 over me. Odd, where did he come from? I don't remember 
38 seeing him before. Then before I can come fully to my 
39 senses, I am confronted by a Godess demanding the reason 
40 for my treaspassing upon her property and breaking into 
41 her home, and the audacity of sitting in her favorite 
42 chair! This must obviously be the owner of this house, 
43 the 'PAM' whose name I saw upon the box outside the 
44 door. Not knowing what to say, I just sit there 
45 dumbfounded slack mouthed and staring...
46 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Elger EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

48 Walking down a musty corridor that has seen better days, Milchar & The 
49 Traveller step deeper into the dungeon.  A low growl is heard ahead, and 
50 a HUGE griffon shifts itself directly in out path!  "There, there", Milchar 
51 says to it," we won't be staying long."  Satisfied with the answer, the beast
52 lays back down.
53 A few more feet brings the two to a door of wooden construction, but also 
54 having very large steel straps binding it.  A small sliding panel was mounted
55 in the door.  Milchar gives it one tap, two, and finally three, then waits.
56 The small panel opens momentarily, and ancient eyes stare at the two adventurers
57 as if calculating their worth.  "Milchar, you still live?", he ventures 
58 cautiously.  "ORr is that you, Oberon, poking fun at me?  How can I really
59 tell?  Hmm... Yes!  If you ARE Milchar, then recite the Emerald Way to build
60 a tesseract."
61 MIlchar thinks a moment, and starts to reply but is interrupted by Traveller.
62 "You construct a box of normal dimensions, then place an Emerald of high
63 quality in each corner of the box, then place a Portable Hole inside, 
64 and finally cast a Wish to complete the process."  Milchar stares at him, 
65 dumbfounded, but says nothing.  Dworkin seems suprised also, but says,
66 "Well, if it isn't you, someone has well-educated friends.  Tell me, what of
67 your work?  Your tower?  I see a place enscribed deeply in your mind....
68 'The Inn'?  But I begin to babble.  Come, come."
69 They follow the humped figure of Dworkin, whose back straightens as they
70 go.  "How long has it been?", Dworking mutters.  "Milchar-  you, of all the
71 blood of Amber in the Fifth Generation, are the only one who can shift shadow
72 to any great extent.  Yes, ability does decline with the generations, but
73 you... are a special case.  Your mother was not... normal.  It is time you
74 heard the story, and this time, all of it."
75 Traveller, by this time, was deeply engrossed in a scattering of large cards
76 on a nearby table.  He bent down to look at them, and saw faces the thought
77 he recognized... Staring harder, one of the cards seemed to stir faintly.  
78 The picture was of a man in black and silver, whose cloak was fastened with
79 a silver rose.  Also in the picture was- L'homme!  "Milchar!  L'homme is in
80 this card!"  Milchar diverts his attention from the ramblings of Dworkin
81 long enough to see what Traveller was talking about.  "Trumps!  Traveller,
82 how can you use them, even at a primitive stage?"
83 Dworkin stops his chattering for a moment, considering.  "Traveller, do you
84 have any, well, strange blood in your family?  This is all getting quite  
85 confusing.  Hold.  My mental state is deteriorating, get out while you can!
86 Use a Trump!  Hurry!"
87 Milchar grabs a card at random, concentrates, and he and Traveller are
88 pulled through just tiin time.

96 "I take it, then, that this ' L'homme ' is a friend of yours?"  Lord Corwin asks Voyeur.  At Voyeurs nod, he continues 
97 "in that case, since he seems to be having some problem convincing his conveyance to continue, I will 'encourage' it the 
98 rest of the way into the city.  We will go down to meet it, for I would like to know how your friend made it as far as he
99 did.  Something strange seems to be going on, and I mean to get to the bottom of it."  With that he turned and left the 
100 room, with Voyeur trailing in his wake.  Voyeur wasn't sure exactly where he was, but at least this Corwin didn't seem 
101 actively hostile, and appeared to have the power to return him to Innisfall if need be.

114 "Will the Delegates please come to order", the chair called, empahsizing his
115 plea with a knock of the gavel. Ignoring him the delegates to the Galactic 
116 presidential nominating convention continued to mill on the floor, chanting 
117 and carring signsin support of Lang Hestrom, the V.P. of the assisinated 
118 former dictator. After a few more useless calls and taps of the gavel, the 
119 Chair signaled the protection committee to clear the floor. It was not as if
120 the demonstration had been disrupting anything important, the nominee had 
121 been selected weeks earlier in secret committee infighting. Of course none 
122 of the delegates on the floor realized this, the chair only had been 
123 informed because of his wife's chairwomenship of that comittee. The floor
124 finally quieted and the informal nominations began to come in as each
125 delegation was called and asked for a nomination. The chair knew the exact
126 procedure to be followed. The selected candidate would be introduced under 
127 informal from the Earth delegation and so, would end up as V.P. barganing 
128 chip. Then he would be selected as V.P. and evidence of the financial 
129 manipulation of the presidential nominee would come out. The subsequent 
130 expulsion of the nominee would put him as the most face saving substitute 
131 and as one of the last items the delegates would confirm him as presidential
132 nominee.

162      Moving  through the dark forest slowly,  for it did not bode 
163 one  well  to  move quickly here,  I come to  a  small  clearing.  
164 This  appeared to be as good a spot as any to camp for the night. 
165 Setting  the wards around the edge of the clearing,  I sit  down, 
166 and  build  a small camp fire to roast the small pheasent  I  had 
167 caught earlier in the day.
168      For many weeks now I had been searching the trail, following 
169 what few spores I found.   How many times had I come so close  to 
170 finding her again?  They have been so few, and tentative at best.  
171 Yet still I keep trying, for I find that I still must continue to 
172 search  for  my dear friend Emer.
173      That  last day that I saw her moving down the  road  towards 
174 the  cloud shrouded hills,  she had said she would be  back,  but 
175 that  was months ago.   I had decided to begin my search when she 
176 was  far overdue from her normal departure.   The trail had  been 
177 long  and difficult,  crossing back on itself  many  times.   Yet 
178 always it wound ever so slowly upwards. 
179      Cooking  my dinner over the fire,  I wonder what maddness is 
180 this  that  causes  me to leave my  safe  and  secure  home?   To 
181 endanger my health,  my very life, to go in search of Emer?  What 
182 do I expect to gain from it if I do again find her?  Searching my 
183 mind  at length I find I still have no answer to these questions, 
184 yet  still I know I must continue searching.  What is  this  that 
185 drives me ever onward?  
186      A  crackling  sputtering sound brings me back to  life,  and 
187 quickly  snatching my dinner from the fire I wrap it in my  cloak 
188 to  put  out  the fire.   Looking at the charred  remains  of  my 
189 dinner, I resign myself to jerky for dinner again tonight. 
190      Sigh.........

262  My beautiful Mazda had been stolen! The one the friends called the
263 Mach V. It just seems to have disappeared leaving only a manhole cover in
264 the space where it had been parked. 
265 To my surprise, the man hole cover opened up and a hand beckoned me 
266 inside. What the heck. I jump climb in and start to descend.
267 When I'm just inside the street, my ninja trained hand somehow
268 looses grip ladder. I'm falling down an unreal hole with lights zipping

273 After the prismatic after-image fades, Milchar and Traveller find themselves
274 in a very well-decorated room, obviously furnished by someone with very good
275 taste.  A well-built man was standing at the window, looking outside at the
276 strange storm hovering over the city.  He whirls about, surprised.  "Who are
277 you, able to use the Trumps and also not known to me?  Who is that with you?
278 Speak up, man!  Tell me all, for times recently have been much disturbed."
279 Milchar and Traveller try their best to explain events leading up to their 
280 present situation, but they obviously lack the necessary verbal skills to 
281 completely relate everything.  Soon the man gets very confused, and asks for
282 additional explanation.  "Hmmm... You are Corwin's great-grandson?  Well, 
283 welcome to Amber, for you probably won't get a welcome from anyone else!
284 No one who knows of you here can honestly say that he trusts you, for the
285 Magical Arts are unknown here, and we do not know what to expect.  Are you
286 still able to walk the pattern, after all these years and straining of Amber
287 blood?"

362 (The line before last was too crude to be left on the system, and so I zapped
363 the poor thing.  Mike, I apologize on that jerk's behalf.)
364 Milchar thought about all the questions put forth to him, and finally said,
365 "There is one way that I could discover what ails Amber, but it is dangerous.
366 Even moreso than walking the Pattern.  Traveller, We must postpone our little
367 trip to the Ruby Valley, as more pressing matters are presenting themselves.
368 Random- Is there a room that I may use that no one can get into while I am
369 there?  I mean, normally- by walking or breaking in."
370 "Yes, there is:  The library.  It has double doors that may be bolted from 
371 the inside, which is the only way in.  Will that do?"
372 "Yes, that will be quite satisfactory.  Traveller, We know that Voyeur is 
373 in Amber somewhere, and others are bound to follow.  Find them!  Tell them 
374 that what is happening is much greater than what is shown on the surface.  
375 Amber may be in great danger, and other realities may be also!"
376 Milchar follows Random, who shows him the way to the library, and Traveller
377 leaves the palace on a fine horse.  "Farewell, Traveller- And good luck!"
378 Milchar shuts and bolts the doors to the very large library, which contains 
379 books of every size, color, and discription.  Tables lined with books filled

381 The Arch-Mage finds a place to sit on the floor, and begins to scribe a 
382 pentagram of silver fire about himself.  The heatless flame began to burn,
383 and mystical words of power were uttered in that protective ring.

387 Lord Corwin and Voyeur emerge from the large edifice which is the visible seat of power in Amber, and approach a cleared
388 area, apparently some sort of plaza.  Sitting in the middle of the space is the misplaced Mustang, surrounded by a curious
389 group of onlookers, and several jumpy guards.  Voyeur cannot see L'homme, but does notice that the car's hood is up.  As 
390 he nears, he begins to discern L'homme's voice, muttering and crooning to the car, alternately concerned about any damage
391 done to it in its strange transition, and confused about its reluctance to operate.  As Voyeur rounds the car to the front,
392 he finally sees L'homme; or at least as much of L'homme as it is possible to see--most of L'homme seems to be inside the
393 engine compartment, surrounded by a wealth of tools and gadgets.  Voyeur, relieved to see his friend safe, and happy to see a
394 familiar face (well, almost see a familiar face), decides to greet L'homme properly.  Noticing the proximity of the hood
395 to L'hommes head, he sneaks up behind him, and shouts "BOO!"
396 ::::::::
397 What can I say, L'homme?  I get kind of weird at 0500, especially after 5 straight hours of accounting homework.
398 ::::::::
399 Milchar-did you know Corwin and I just left the library?  And do you remember that there IS a secret door into it (see
400 nine princes in amber, page 93)
401 ::::::::
402 CISTOP MIKEY-you didn't entirely answer my question.  If I come on the board after someone has left a serious mess, is there
403 anything I can do?  Or, as I suspect, is there a select few who can, but not the common masses? I seem to recall seeing
404 a messsage from you indicating some such thing.

420 YOU SURMISED. THERE ARE A FEW COMMANDS WHICH A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF
421 PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT (2) BECAUSE OF THEIR DESTRUCTIVE NATURE IF MISSUSED.
422 WHICH CAN BE USED. SOME OF THEM ARE OF LITTLE USE TO MOST, SUCH AS
423 SET SYSTEM TO 1200 BAUD FOR LOCAL USE. (NOT MUCH GOOD FOR YOU SINCE
424 BWMS HAS ONLY A 103 MODEM WHICH IS ONLY GOOD FOR 300 BAUD. (EVEN IF
425 BW HAD A 212A IT STILL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE 1200 BAUD, BECAUSE
426 IT IS A SOFTWARE COMMAND, AND NOT HARWARE LIKE THE MODEM REQUIRES.) THERE
427 IS ALSO COMPRESS WHICH GETS RIDE OF THE DELETED LINES COMPRESSING EVERY
428 THING BACK TOGETHER. THIS WAS REMOVED BECAUSE IF YOU HANGUP IN THE 
429 MIDDLE OF IT, IT LEAVES THE FILE IN A MESS. THERE IS A RECOVER ENTIRE
430 DISK, THIS IS STRICTLY A CISTOP COMMAND THAT I USE DURING BACKUPS.
431 ALONG WITH THE CLEAR ENTIRE DISK, AND PROTECT/UNPROTECT COMMANDS WHICH
432 FOR OBVIOUS REASONS OF THEIR OWN ARE NOT AVAILABLE.

435 So much for "Oregon's Summer, part II".  I wasted the nice day cutting
436 the grass, and other such useless pasttimes.
437 Here's a slightly different puzzle:
438 Which one does not belong?
439 a) chessb) bridgec) go
440 d) Mah-Jongge) backgammon
441 and another:
442 Which one does not belong?
443 a) dadab) abstract expressionist
444 c) cubistd) dodecaphonic  e) pointillist
445 ??????????
446 And so the Backwater Message System goes through its eternal evolution.
447 Piper is fading away, Bard and apprentice are heard from less frequently,
448 Emer is no more, Tarn surfaces only rarely in his search for Emer,
449 the mighty PAM has moved on to other things, Contremon Valerius is no
450 longer active, Jonathan Chance, Figment of the Imagination, Fast Freddie (BSAL),
451 Wassir, and all the others whos names escape me at the moment.
452 Previously, however, fresh talent moved in as the jaded moved out.
453 But pickings are mighty slim this turn of the wheel.  Or perhapsas I grow
454 old I get accustomed to familiarity, and resent the differences of
455 'the young'.

486 "These Holly carbs seem to work great one day, and not at all the next", I said
487 to myself while trying to check the float levels. Since this was a double
488 pumper, the float settings were a bit more tricky. Nothing seemed to be wrong
489 with them though. And the electrical system seemed to be OK also.
490 The crowd around me seemed to be growing. I didn't get anywhere trying to
491 explain to them the complex nature of internal combustion, so I tried to
492 keep busy on the engine, all the while trying not to think of the big mess
493 I was in. As I was spraying some WD-40 on a particulary sticky nut, someone
494 snuck up behind me and yelled "BOO!"
495 Hopefully the small dent my head put in the hood can be repaired. With my
496 head still throbing, I turned on this dasterdly person with a craftsman
497 torque wrench in my left hand... Do my eyes deceive me??? Is it...IT IS!!!
498 "Voyeur!!! How are you?!? And where are you...me...us...What is going on
499 here??? And my car? It won't run...but it kept on rolling? Not even Ford
500 can make a car roll that good. And these people? Are they from Beaverton
501 or what? Can you explain this to me?" Voyeur attempted to calm be down.
502 "All of your questions will be answered, as best as I am able to. Why don't
503 you put your tools away in the trunk. There is nothing wrong with your
504 car, but the laws of chemical reactions don't seem to work the same here
505 in amber."
506 "Amber??? What/where is that?" I queried. "That is here!" replied voyeur.
507 "Put you tools away and let's go inside where we can sit down. I think you'll
508 want to sit down when you here what I have to tell you."
509 I went about putting everything back together, and put my tools in the trunk.
510 With the Mustang all locked up, Voyeur, myself, and a yet un-introduced
511 companion made their way through the crowd, and into one of the nearest
512 buildings.

515 One day (In the Tardis, so pick one) The Doctor and K-9 are busily setting 
516 the Time-Space coordinates
517 for Galifrey, when K-9 states:'Doctor, we entering a Time-Space Nebula.'  The D,
518 octor, only half listening, replies:"That's nice, K-9.  Wait!!  Did you say that
519 we are entering a Time-Space Nebula?" 'Affirmative' "Great Scott!!"  The Doctor
520 then orders K-9 to plug into the Tardis, while he tries to pull his faithful
521 -yet tempermental-ship out of the Nebula.  "It's no use!" 'Affirmative' "Well,
522 let's materialize and see where we are." 'Time-Space coordinates 684932/231139:
523 name Amber' "Oh no!  Not again!!  I thought that I'd seen the last of this 
524 place after Brand and Arson."
525 
526 Milchar and friends are sitting at a large dinner table discussing some 
527 important matter, when a faint whirring and clanking is heard in the corner.
528 Then in that same corner, what looks like a London Police-Box materializes
529 after a few minutes.  The door then opens and a tall, curley-headed, rather 
530 good-looking man emerges.  He's wearing a large felt hat and a seemingly end-
531 less rainbow scarf.  Floating at his side is K-9.  "Milchar, my friend!! So
532 good to see you again.  I see that I've arrived in time for dinner.  Why did
533 you intercept the Tardis?  That's not your style." "Why Doctor, I'm glad to see
534 you too!  I see that you've mase improvements to K-9.  Good touch.  Come, sit
535 
536 and join us.  I didn't bring you here, I'm as surprized as you." Milchar replies
537 
538 "Well Milch., someone is manipulating the Time-Space field.  I also see that
539 some, if not all, of my magic is back."  The Doctor then proceeds to make the
540 Tardis intangable, just buy concentrating.  "What's for dinner?"
541 
542 ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????? The Doctor ????????????

544 (Voyeur:They've made improvements to the Castle sindce the publication of the
545 book.  I'm in the newer library.)
546 "We're having seafood, I think, but I can't really be sure with the strange
547 creatures they pull out of the sea here.  I have just come out of a trance,
548 and what interesting things I've learned!  Not to mention deadly.  Somebody
549 wants the Inn (Did I ever tell you of the Inn?) and is proceeding to bring 
550 all of it's defenders here, in hopes that we will all be trapped.  And he's 
551 doing a good job of it.  My spell has been turned against me, and almost all
552 of the ways to the Inn are blocked as it is.  Some others have been 'polarized'
553  just like an AC current being used on a DC appliance.  Not healthy. But 
554 enough chatter.  I only stopped here to regain my strengh before finding the
555 others.  Hmm... Arson, did you say?  My, that WAS a long time ago.  No matter.
556 I will call the others in for a meeting, if my strength holds."
557 Milchar summons his will, and shapes the mind-words to be 'spoken':
558 "VOYEUR! L'HOMME! ANYONE THAT CAN STILL HEAR ME!  THE INN IS IN DANGER! COME
559 INTO THE CASTLE, INTO THE ROYAL DINING HALL!  PLANS WILL BE MADE TO SAVE OUR
560 BELOVED INN!  COME!"

563 Tall trees loomed above me as I walked through the trail deep in the heart of 
564 Forest Park, the huge strach of forest located deep in the heart of PORTLAND, 
565 citMy mind was drifting back to the major hikes I had taken on the Pacific Crest
566 trail when a faint brush touched the outside of my mind. I had the defenses on 
567 full to allow the forest to exercise its soothing presence so whoever was 
568 calling had tremendous power and need to be able to break them. I through my 
569 mind open to the caller and was able to discern a plea for help, a plea that 
570 electrified me. The beloved Inn was in danger, one of my few haunts besides the 
571 forest that was able to exercise healing peace on my mind. Reaching down, I 
572 adjusted the straps on my boots and pushed in the charm that enabled Reality 
573 Crossings. Standing, I stiffened and put out my foot. The forest faded and was 
574 replaced by a gathering onf strangers. Over in the corner a london police call 
575 box added to the strangness. Uncertain what to do, I stood and listened to the 
576 figure at front.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

579 Seeing that the group assembled before him was all that could/would arrive,
580 Milchar begins to speak. "Traveller, Voyeur, L'homme, Doctor- and who are you,
581 sir?  If you are interested in the Inn's good welfare, then welcome!  But 
582 wait.  I babble again.  I shall learn of you later.  Friends, There is a man
583 who has created a machine of enourmous proportions and is using it to 
584 systematically crush all the routes from Amber to the Inn.  I know this sounds
585 like ana impossible job, with the energy required, beut let me assure you it
586 is so.  I need all of your skills-  or we may never leave Amber again (though
587 it is a lovely place) and the Inn will be under the control of this brute.
588 Not to mention... PAM!  She lies back there, not defenseless, but against 
589 such power cannot hope to last for long.  We must each go and try to slip 
590 through the carefully built defenses, mazeways, dead ends, and pitfalls our
591 captor has created.  A group has no hope, but one or two could conceivably
592 pass through at a given point.  Yes, I suggest that we go in pairs, one to 
593 watch over the othere.  Doctor, would you be my partner for this trip?  We 
594 always did have a knack for getting out of trouble, and I pray that it hasn't
595 left us.  Well, gentlemen, that is all.  Attack the barriers and get to the 
596 Inn as quickly as possible.  We must find a good place to meet there- hmm...

599 Milchar: It would be and honor to pair up with you after all these months.
600 You don't mind if K-9 comes along do you?  We may need him, not to mentio
601 his energy.  Stranger, I do not know of you, but if the 'Great' Milchar will
602 trust you, I shall also.  Before we leave, allow me to make the Tardis 
603 invisible, astral, unnoticeable, undetectable, and intangable.  There,
604 now, shall we leave???
