62    Not to be left in the cold, Rosewood decided that the best time to enter
63 an empty room was just after the lights had been turned out and the door 
64 had just been closed. He wasn't to good at picking windows, quite noisy
65 actually, but then what need was there to be quiet when the room was empty
66 anyway? Having totally given up with the picks, he tried the more subtle 
67 approach: quantity one fist meets quantity one window pane. He was  amused
68 by such things, broken glass had a tendency to remind him of Bolivia.
69 As he attempted to pull himself through the glass, the tie that his mother
70 had chosen for him before he went off to work had just become a decidedly
71 smaller tie due to all the broken glass and the tact with which he passed
72 by it. After all was not said and done, Rosewood crept to the door with as
73 little noise as possible. Poking his head out the door to see if his subject
74 had left the hallway, he found his nose in a rather odd predicament, it 
75 had become lodged in Taggart's laft shoe.
76   "Billy, what do you think you're doing down there? And would you please 
77 take your face off my foot?"
78   "Oh, hi. Just checking..."
79   "If you mean- is Semplers gone yet? Yes, he is. He got on the elevator 
80 just as I was getting off, not in much of a rush either. I guess you didn't
81 scare him too badly with all that noise. What was it anyway... Nevermind,
82 I don't want to know."
83   Rosewood just came back with, "yea... huh? well..." His standard reply.
84 At that, Taggart wakled into the room and closed the door behind him while
85 turning on the overhead lights to scan the surroundings.
86   "Nothing unusual, the basic Thrike telephone scrambler modulator with all
87 the accessories... "said Taggart with a smile. "Too bad we never can tell
88 just when these things are going to be flipped on..." He then noticed 
89 Rosewood sticking his finger his ear just to get rid of that sound.
90   "Yes, and as could be expected, Nothing else. Why do they always leave 
91 these dumb modulators behind anyway?" wondered Rosewood.
92   "Kind of like adding insult to injury, I would guess," replied Taggart.
93   Showing some promise as to possibly becoming a top level agent, Rosewood
94 spots a three-ring binder sitting out on the dresser with the half open 
95 drawer. "Hey, I think we have something here. Take a look at this...
96 some sort of a journal with lots of copies of missing ship transit orders.
97   "That's just a plant. C'mon... Think! We know that he's into salvage, but
98 for what reason, God only knows. Start looking for something better than
99 that, Billy."
100   "Like what, the modulator?" he says in jest.
101   "Hmmm... You just might have something there. He could be trying to use 
102 reverse psychology on us by leaving it in the open like this. Maybe it IS
103 something he wants to hide from us. What better place to hide something than
104 out in the open?"    Taggart began to ponder his last statement.
105   "Wouldn't that be to easy? I think the answer is in this binder somewhere."
106 says Rosewood as he flips through some more pages.
107   "C'mon. Let's get a couple of guys to get this thing out of here," ordered
108 Taggart. "you can bring the binder with you if you think it will help."
109 Rosewood closed the binder and put the remainder of his tie in his pocket and
110 followed Taggart out of the room. If only he knew...

130 "Yes, that's the van all right," I said again.
131 L'homme, in the meantime, had pushed the poor FIAT to its ill-defined limits.  "How good of shape is the motor in,
132 anyway?" I asked as I heard the engine strain all the more.
133 We dodged cars until we arrived at the intersection, then turned.  The van was moving along at a fairly slow pace in
134 plain sight just two blocks away.
135 "I've got an idea.  How about we get a car labled 'Student Driver' next time so no one will pay any attention to your
136 driving?", I said.  L'homme just grinned, amused at my nervousness.
137 The van slowed, and then stopped before the delivery entrance of a film-developing shop, one of many occupying this
138 part of Portland.  Two men got out of the cab, and opened the end of the van.  They hauled two coffin-sized crates
139 labeled 'Kodak film' into the shop before L'homme brought the FIAT to a rest just a half-block away.
140 "C'mon, time to earn our keep, Farley.  We'll observe the place from out here for a while then move in as opprotunity
141 allows.  How are you at waiting patiently?"
142 "Not too good, I'm afraid.  I'd like to go in that film shop and see what's developing."
143 L'homme winced at my poor joke.  "Another pseudo-pun like that and Ian'll have your job.  Let's wait the arcade across
144 the street.  Arcades are usually crowded and no one will notice us."
145 Following L'homme's lead, we crossed the street and soon were immersed in the noises and lights of the arcade.

160 THE THIEFTHET THETHIEF    THETHIEF THETHIEF     ------------------------------------
161 
162 HI< I Ii, I am new around here.  I will try tofit in if I could.  The stories on here
163 are pretty darn good. Too bad the policeman is leaving, I hope he enjoys whatever he is going to do.  
164 
165 Becky T.-     That's a good story, and                what a good moral.
166 
167 Kathyd -      I don't know what happened              to you, but sorry it had
168               to happen to you.
169 
170 Farley -      I really enjoyed your
171               story, keep up the good
172               work.
173 
174 Well, here is my try at writing a story.
175 
176 
177   As I walk into the 7-Eleven store I see cameras everywhere.  I thought to myself, how was I going to rob this place?
178 Then I snuck back into the back room
179 of the store,  I know there has to be
180 a switch somewhere to turn the cameras
181 on and off.  As I looked to my left I
182 saw a switch that said "CAMERAS" so I
183 flipped the switch.  I then snuck back
184 out and noticed that the cameras had
185 stopped and i approached the cashier.
186 I told him to give me all the money
187 in the register.  He says, I just 
188 all the money into the safe about five
189 minutes ago.  I felt angered and pointedmy gun in his face,  the cashier says
190 I am telling the truth!  How much money
191 do you want?  I will write you a check
192 How is that?  I'll give you my VISA, butplease don't kill me.  I decide to take
193 the check.  I told the cashier to write
194 it for $3500.  He gladly wrote me the
195 check.  I've never had an easier 
196 robbery.  I then leave the store quicklyand take off in my car.  As I look in
197 my rear-view mirror I see a Policeman
198 following me.  He points at me to pull
199 over so I do.  He says,  Your car fits
200 the description to the car that just
201 robbed a 7-Eleven store down the road
202 about 5 minutes ago.  I told the officerI didn't know anything about it. The
203 officer asked me to empty my pockets.
204 As I empty my pockets the check falls
205 out, and the policeman picks it up, and
206 says, "i thought you said you didn't know anything about the robbery? "  I then
207 hit him straight in the face, and start
208 running off, and I hear him say, "Don't
209 you want the check?  I am the POLICEMAN
210 i quit today.  Here take it, and get
211 out of here before some other cop
212 comes around looking for you."  I 
213 couldn't believe it I met the POLICEMAN and he was nice enough to let me go.
214 I took off with the check, and spent
215 it the next day on a new car.  I couldn't believe today, but it really happened.I stopped off at 7-Eleven the next night
216 and the cashier didn't mention a word tome about the check he wrote me,  the
217 closer I looked at him, I noticed that
218 the cashier was MATT DILLON, and now
219 I knew why he didn't mind missing $3500
220 it was already a millionaire, and I wentup to him and asked him for his own
221 autograph, and he gladly did it, and told me if I was ever in need of money,
222 just come and ask for it.  He said that
223 he was trying to rehabilitate robbers, and he did a good job of curing me.
224 
225                          The End
226 
227 Sorry for all the blank lines, I did
228 them on accident.

238   I take my new black Celica out for a test drive.  As I drive down I-5 I
239 floor it, and notice it maxes out at 205 MPH easily.  I then slow down, and
240 see this good-looking girl, in a car that was an old-beater.  I leaned over
241 to roll down my window, and asked her if she would like a Ferrari .  The
242 blonde looked at me strangely, and half-laughing says sure.  I pull over
243 to Classical Cars Unlimited, and told her she could have any car that was
244 on the lot.  She blushes and says, "I couldn't do that, by the way why are
245 you doing this, and I explained to her that I just won 7 million dollars
246 in the Oregon state lottery, and I passing my winnings on down to other
247 people who needed it more than me because I was already a mass millionaire
248 before the lottery.  She then picks a bright red Lambourghini, and offers
249 me to come over to her house.  I couldn't resist.  I follow her in her new
250 car, and I drueled all the way there.  I pull into her driveway, and step
251 out of my car.  She invites me into her house, and we go into her bedroom
252 and start making noises.  One hour later, I thank her for the good time,
253 and told her it was my first time.  She goes I meet alot of guys like that
254 they seem to never done it before.  I give all you guys lessons.  I then
255 go thanks for the lesson on "How to drive more than 55 times!"

283    The mood was tense as Tina and Jack entered the building, Tina was dressed
284 in a gray wool suit; with side slits a modest 5 inches on both sides. Jack 
285 had been well groomed for the occasion. Tina had had Jack up to the wee hours
286 coaching him on pit procedure. Her role would be to direct form the sidelines.
287 They stopped at the cafe and picked up coffee and bagels, after wolfing them
288 down and getting a good dose of cafe, out team was ready for action.
289      Marci and Tony were waiting out the next two days in Marci's condo,
290 needless to say; there personalities clash terribly and they were at 
291 each others throats.
292    tony:  Marci, your such a s**t, what do you have planned for poor
293           Jack?  you know he's very impressionable.
294    Marci: Tony, you ignorant misguided fool, open your eyes and see what
295           is real. Jack and I have very special chemistry, your just
296           experiencing jealousy because he thinks of me when he wakes up\
297           and not you.
298    tony:  You b***h, ill get you...
299     
300     Tony jumps up and leaps over the couch, catching his foot on the top
301 tipping the coach onto its back and Tony on to his face.
302 
303    Marci: see that's what you get, you klutz, im afraid i may have to lead
304           our mission the day after tommorow.
305 
306    tony: (wiggling his nose with his finger) I think it's broken tin, could
307          you get some ice?
308    
309    Marci: your delirious, my name is Marci, get your own ice.
310        
311         Marci stomps into her room slaming the door. (a lock turning is heard)

314 moer careful about making corrections. In your previous entry (not the one
315 above) you sent some ESC sequences to correct your msg. They may have made
316 it look ok on your terminal, but they kinda scrambled things on mine...

319   tilean stepped out of the elevator... watched all the people seep into the lobby... made his way for the front doors...
320   a long gray sleek car pulled in front of him... tilean opened the hatch door... and stooped to enter it... the interior was
321 normal... so was the dash... no excesses aside from the gray telephone set to the side of the drivers seat...
322 
323   markesson was out of the drivers seat and walking around to the passenger seat... and tilean unlocked the door for him...
324   "i always did enjoy having the driver's seat on the wrong side..." said tilean mockingly...
325   "only wrong for some people" ssaid markesson... entering... just as mockingly...
326 
327   "say... how are you... i have not seen you since stockholm in eighty-one..." said markesson.
328   "i am fine... i lack a true sense of the tongue here though... i am sure you noticed... i am less than fluent here... makes
329 me real nervous..." said tilean... as if speaking to a life long friend...
330 
331   "i almost want to say it..." said markesson...
332   "say what..." asked tilean...
333   "it has been said before..."
334   "what is it..." demanded tilean... getting just a little annoyed with the joke... Whatever it was...
335 
336   "i hope we're in for some gratuitous sex... and violence..." uttered markesson... hoping for the words to sink in before the
337 referrence did...
338 
339   "you watch too many movies... anyway... what is the situation here..." asked tilean... gaining a very serious sound to his
340 words...
341   "well... two soviet submarine are docked in one of our port cities... although we have the port officials and everyone else
342 on our pay list... no one seems to be able to find out what they're doing down there..." tilean's harsh and serious tone had
343 obviously worried markesson... and it was that worry which warranted such an unfeeling report... strict words and phrases...
344 
345   "i had heard of radiological testing that turned up some nuclear problems in one of them..." said tilean still seriously...
346   "the siakesk... in three sections of the submarine... there are three distinct sites of radiological presense..."
347   "accidental leakage..." asked tilean... scaring markesson...
348   "possibly... it would not hamper them leaving port though... and soviet submarine never stay in any one port longer than is
349 absolutely necessary..." said markesson... worry showing through in his intonations...
350 
351   tilean noticed the worry... it ought to be dealt with... first he ought to think... not staying in one port long was left
352 over from the days of yarnosk in the russian navy... it was odd to see other people operating under the orders of a friend...
353 
354   "perhaps they suffered more damage than just to their missiles... perhaps they had to abort a launch... it is possible you
355 know... several of our agents think that the soviets almost tried first strike... and the submarine commanders had to abort
356 launch on there own..."
357 
358   "i know of the theory... it states a soviet mistake ordered all the submarine based misiles fired... and the order had to be
359 aborted by each submarine... the submarine in the berring sea was the only one to not abort all of the launches..." corrected
360 tilean... wondering why markesson was so slow in explaining...
361 
362   "right... the berring sea launch took attack course towards a german port city... the soviets shot it down... but not before
363 causing a very international incident first..." said markesson... trying to be as cold as tilean was being... served him right
364 too...
365 
366 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
367 
368   why is tilean being so damned cold... i know him... he is not like this... something has affected him in administrations...
369   something is worrying him... or something is scaring him... and if it is scaring him... i ought to have been informed... so
370 if i have not been informed i did not need to know... and god knows i have enough reason to know things that what it is... it
371 is pretty damned important...
372 
373   "tilean... why are you here... this is routine clean up... why is a big shot administrator attending to small fry satraps
374 like us..." asked markesson...
375   "i... wanted to... uh... i wanted back in the field... i could lie about thinking this was bigger than it was... i... uh...
376 wanted back in the field... okay...?" said tilean...
377 
378   markesson was calmed... it made sense... tilean did not seem to be lying... he was just plain tired of administrations... so
379 this was a sort of... vacation for tilean... no need to do anything beyond normal paperwork...
380 
381 tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
382 
383   lying to markesson had not been easily done... but tilean knew markesson suspected something really big... and markesson was
384 right... if only tilean could have permitted markesson to go on beleiving that...

386 And so I return, a few disks later.  I wonder what I missed?
387 Since poems have been in demand hereabouts I believe I'll put in one:
388 THE WIGHT
389      Across his darkness is deathly chill
390      He is silent, in starchy still,
391      Waiting to glean his empty fill.
392  
393      Sinewy strength is his, and firey fight
394      Out of sight, his horrendous might
395      Then the light!  Flees the wight.

398   As I was walking to my room after a test on Salem, I saw a large koala bear carrying a bag. "Hello," I cried. Once I had 
399 gotten him out of the Dean's possible line of sight (she would have thought he was conjured, and would have demanded he be 
400 sent back), I asked why he had come. Not that I expected him to know, he usually did't, but it was a courtesy to assume he had
401  a purpose.
402   After I gave him a cup of eucalyptus tea, I started my excuse. "I tried to go to the Inn last night, but my carriage broke."
403 I explained, trying to give a new excuse. It was always something, but really I wanted to be perfect when I met them. He 
404 sounded upset and said that if I didn't want to go, I should just say so.
405  "No, no. I want to go, but I don't know how to act. Some of my companions have a gift for sang-froid. My talents are differ-
406 ent. I like the patrons I have met: you and The Man in Gray. I like what I have seen of other people, but there are certain 
407 things- phrases which must be avoided, people who must be flattered- things that I MUST know before I jump headlong into a new
408 circle of people.
409  "And anyway, I'd rather wait until they're through discusing espionage exclusively."
410  I put oil on my willow staff (willow is the Moon's tree and my devotion is to her) and thought about the spell caster with 
411 the rowan wand.He is another reason why I do not go; rowan is the Kelt's prophylactic against witches, and a tree of fire- wil
412 low is a tree of water; if he were to be against me, I would have to call onn Her or lose.
413  The Former told me about his newest leaf and I slowly decided to try to go to the Inn again, but I'd have to prepare. Agree-
414 ing that preparation might be in order, he politely took his leave.
415 
416  I washed and put on a white dress and cape. I got my book and staff. Just as I was leaving I remembered my gloves. Now, I 
417 thought, if you fail this time, they will never forgive you.
418  When I was fifty cubits from the Inn, my horses started to behave as if I'd never trained them. Surprized, I tried to come up
419 with a reason. "Of course!" I said rather too loudly, "it's the tree." There is a rowan tree outside the Inn and my horses 
420 were trained with the Art. So I tied them to a nice, safe oak tree and walked the rest of the way.
421  There were the usual people crowding outside by the windows, "the lurkers", and I seriously considered joining them. But I 
422 had promised I'd go in the Inn, so in the Inn I decided to go.

434 Lady S.:  I had been given short notice that you would actually venture down
435    the way to the Inn once more. This time I am pleased to find that you were
436    not in the rush to leave and had entered a passage on the subject that had
437    been given only too small of rememberance lately. 
438           Having received a gracious nod and a word of warning, I too shall 
439    join you already within the Inn shortly. (my story has a bad habit of being
440    written down before I enter it. It's never been continued for I haven't sat
441    back down with pen in hand for such a task since the Shut-Down Scare of '84)
442    Hopefully, the trend that I had been initiated with shall return with some
443    strength and familiar names behind it, names only in the memory, names still
444    to be born. (You listening out there d, Pam, Tarn, and Milchar????)

450   The piper sat at a back table, skean dubh in one hand, the razor-sharp
451 edge peeling microscopic slivers off a recalcitrant reed.  Squinting, he
452 examined the lip and binding of the reed -- even, firmly bound, it should
453 work.... he placed it to his lips, and a SKRAWW, like the call of a
454 startled crow, cut through the firelit atmosphere of the inn.
455   Smilling faintly, the piper took a draught from the jack of ale sitting
456 on the table next to him, sloshing a few drops when he put down the tarred
457 leather container a little more firmly than was truly necessary.
458   Pulling the chanter from his stand of pipes, he fit the new reed to it and
459 tentatively blew a few scales.  A taroulath, a crunluath, hidiroch, haroo
460 -- ahh hirrichin ahhhooo hirrichin--- the translation of the sustained
461 notes into vowel sounds and the rapid bubbling gracings into consonants
462 was automatic.  Replacing the chanter into its stock, the piper swung his
463 piper
464 s to his shoulder and strode out onto a less packed area of the inn's
465 worn plank floor.  With one great breath, he inflated the bag, tapped the
466 drones into unison, set his fingers dancing over the chanter to
467 "The Black Bear's Hornpipe."

471 ........So difficult to get on now days.....
472 L'homme,
473 	So in your professional opinion the results are nominal...Indeed
474 I must agree. There does not seem to be any skewing of rolls..It seems to
475 depend on sound strategy. What were Gages thoughts ?
476 	Thanks for the excerpt.
477 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
478  
479 alchemist,
480         You speak of things long forgotten but always remembered. Nuances 
481 of a younger time. As I type this my mind drifts back ..the smell of charcoal 
482 and broiling flying fish..of "seetru"..of steel drums lilting in the night
483 ..of fetes and carnival past. Many and strong are those memories..
484         But the spice ambrosia never has passed my lips. My trip to 
485 St. Georges was too short. The Bajan skipper was taking his family up
486 the chain, and my commitments would not allow more time. So it was
487 back to Sam Lord's Castle on LIAT for me. Looking down from the "plane"
488 ( and I use the term loosly ) I kept searching for another making the passage.
489 That telltale triangle cloth against the iridescent blue. The search was
490 in vain. 
491         Driving home through cane fields, I kept thinking...my first voyage
492 .first voyage... The thought kept kept a smile on my face for weeks.
493         Where were you in July of 74...I was just across the harbor from
494 Anse Mitane. Parental obligation required my passage across the fair 'baie' 
495 to indulge one of my fathers business associates son in an arcane scottish 
496 sport, ( sorry piper ) we tilled the soil and they discussed matters of
497 			<< GREAT IMPORTANCE >>     
498 ....restaurants..roulette theory..chemin de fer..and many of the other vices
499 that make the province so unique. The name of the farm we were so diligently
500 excavating was the " Empress Josephine ". Before returning to the city, 
501 he suggested we eat at a small " Beachstro " near the ferry. 
502 I believe that was Anse Mitane. My memory clouds there ...as I remember 
503 just the good food and the bikini... ! singular !. At 17 I was suffering from
504 hormonal overdose. Several hours later when I regained my power of speech 
505 I spoke of nothing but returning .... 
506                 A promise I plan to keep one of these good years.

516 Arcadia... The noise; the flash; the darkness; the light. Rows of machines catering to eager youngsters partaking of a
517 bit of excitement and fantasy for a few silver coins. Each machine was occupied; each machine busy supplying its operator
518 with thrills, chills, and eventual death.
519                 "HAH HAH INTRUDER! HAH HAH HUMANOID!"
520 Back to reality. L'homme and Farley stayed close to the door, straining to see through slots on the black art board that
521 covered the windows and added to the dark decorum of the arcade. The van and its two former occupants were across the 
522 street. #Kodak Delivery boys? Hardly.#, though L'homme. #I would sure like to know what is in those boxes they carried.# 
523 "Hey mistu...", a voice tugged for my attention. "Mistu, you got change for a dolla?" "Sure kid." He handed my a dollar
524 bill, and L'homme responded in kind with four quarters. He turned without saying a word, and placed a quarter on top of
525 the nearest CENTIPEDE machine. #What's a kid with a New York accent doing in NW Portland? I better check this out.#
526 "Farley, watch our friends. If they start to leave, whistle." Farley nodded. L'homme turned to the nearby game machine,
527 but the kid was gone. #The dollar bill he gave me!# It looked normal enough. No special markings, nothing unusual at all.
528 #Wait...The series date. It can't be! Not yet...A message, it's got to be.# L'homme returned to the front where Farley
529 still watched across the street. "On the jump! We are moving in. Better check on Betsy, things may get a little hot."
530 "Why the sudden decision?", Farley queried, and he had every right too. "Never mind for now. Let's go."
531 Two men cross the street. Nothing unusual to the untrained eye. Who could see these men were heavily armed, and intent 
532 on relieving two delivery men and a developing shop of a big load of film. The door crumbled under the half-charge from
533 L'homme's gun. The crash was closely followed by the two men entering the shop, shooting first, asking question to anyone
534 unlucky enough to be left alive later. Sudden bursts of violence are shocking to some, but in the working life of a NET
535 agent, such bursts are the norm, rather than the exception.
536 #Farley will just have to get used to it.# L'homme relieved a rather evil looking gunman from his will to live. The rather
537 one-sided battle only lasted a few moments. The two delivery men, and the lone ehop employee were now out of action.
538 "We have got to move fast. Grab the cannisters. You take one end, I'll take the other. We've got to get these things to
539 the car before the local law enforcement representatives arrive. No time to notify Ian about the attack, so we are on
540 our own.", L'homme directed his new partner, who followed directions to a tee. A minute later they were in the car, speeding
541 away (as much as the FIAT could handle) and ignoring the curious stares of confued onlookers. "I'm going to drive up to 
542 Gabriel Park. I want a little privacy when we open our Christman presents.", L'homme glanced back at the new found
543 gifts riding in the backseat. Farley was shaken, but not as bad as before, right after the twinkie truck incident.
544 "Don't worry,", assured L'homme. "you'll get used to it. You have to, or you won't be worth a proverbial plugged nickel."
545 Farley noded his head, and began reloading Betsy. Three quarters of a clip had been used in the shootout. Pretty quick
546 shooting considering how little time actually transpired. Silence was the third occupant of the car, until the sign pointing
547 the Gabriel Park exit appeared on the left. "Here's our turnoff." L'homme downshifted the Fiat, and turned into the parking
548 lot. A blue late model Dodge was the only other car in the lot. L'homme parked, pulled the parking brake into place, and
549 turned to Farley. "Well now we find out if my hunch was right." #Hunch! We just killed three men on a hunch!#  But Farley 
550 knew better than to voice his opinion of L'homme's supposed Dirty Harry morality. Sometimes things are just better left
551 unsaid.

583 {So he took counsel with his Wazir about visiting him, but the Minister, find-}
584 {ing the project unadvisable, recommended that a letter be written and a pres-}
585 {ent be sent under his charge to the younger brother with an invitation to    }
586 {visit the elder. Having accepted this advice the King forthwith bade prepare }
587 {handsome gifts, such as horses with saddles of gem-encrusted gold; Mamelukes,}
588 {or white slaves; beautiful handmaids, high-breasted virgins, and splendid    }
589 {stuffs and costly. He then wrote a letter to Shah Zaman expressing his warm  }
590 {love and great wish to see him, ending with these words, "We therefore hope  }
591 {of the favour and affection of the beloved brother that he will condescend to}
592 {bestir himself and turn his face us-wards. Furthermore we have sent our Wazir}
593 {to make all ordinance for the march, and our one and only desire is to see   }
594 {thee ere we die; but if thou delay or disappoint us we shall not survive the }
595 {blow. Wherewith peace upon thee!" Then King Shahryar, having sealed the mis- }
596 {sive and given it to the Wazir with the offerings aforementioned, commanded  }
597 {him to shorten his skirts and strain his strength and make all expedition in }
598 {going and returning. "Harkening and obedience!" quoth the Minister, who fell }
599 {to making ready without stay and packed up his loads and prepared his requi- }
600 {sites witout delay. This occupied him three days, and on the dawn of the     }
601 {fourth he took leave of his King and marched right away, over desert and     }
602 {hillway, stony waste and pleasant lea without halting by night or by day. But}
603 {whenever he entered a realm whose ruler was subject to his Suzerain, where he}
604 {was greeted with magnificent gifts of gold and silver and and all manner of  }
605 {presents fair and rare, he would tarry there three days, the term of the     }
606 {guest rite; and when he left on the fourth, he would be honourably escorted  }
607 {for a whole day's march. As soon as the Wazir drew near Shah Zaman's court in}
608 {Samarcand he despatched to report his arrival one of his high officials, who }
609 {presented himself before the King; and, kissing ground between his hands, de-}
610 {livered his message. Hereupon the King commanded sundry of his Grandees and  }
611 {Lords of his realm to fare forth and meet his brother's Wazir at the distance}
612 {of a full day's journey; which they did, greeting him respectfully and wish- }
613 {ing him all prosperity and forming an escort and a procession. When he enter-}
614 {ed the city he proceeded straightway to the palace, where he presented him-  }
615 {self in the royal presence; and, after kissing ground and praying for the    }
616 {King's health and happiness and for victory over his all his enemies, he in- }
617 {formed him that his brother was yearning to see him, and prayed for the      }
618 {pleasure of a visit. He then delivered the letter which Shah Zaman took from }
