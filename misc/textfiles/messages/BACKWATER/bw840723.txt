21 OK, LET ME ANSWER THE VARIOUS QUESTIONS/STATEMENTS SENT MY WAY;
22 1. COMPLAINT ABOUT HIGH TECH IN THE INN: THE INN IS AN IMAGE THAT WAS 
23 CAREFULLY BUILT UP OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BY MYSELF AND SEVERAL OTHERS 
24 THE INTENT WAS TO CREATE A RELAXED AND COMFORTABLE ATMOSPHERE THAT DID NOT 
25 HAVE ALL THE COMPUTER AND RELATED TALK THAT THE OTHER BBS SYSTEMS HAD AT THE 
26 TIME. THIS WAS USED AS A SPRING BOARD TO CREATE STORIES FROM. MY COMPLAINT 
27 COMES FROM SEEING THIS CREATION BEING MODIFIED AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL 
28 INTENT. NOTE THAT I HAVE NOT COMPLAINED AGAINST THE MCKANE STORYLINE OTHER 
29 THEN THAT IT DOES NOT INTEREST ME AS I AM NOT INTO THAT SORT OF THING. I 
30 WOULD HOPE THAT I HAVE THAT PARTICULAR RIGHT TO COMPLAIN JUST AS YOU 
31 COMPLAIN ABOUT THE THINGS YOU DON'T LIKE HERE. AND I ALSO HOPE I HAVE THE 
32 RIGHT TO DEFEND MY FANTASY WORLD AS DO YOU. I MIGHT REMIND YOU OF THE NEAR 
33 TOTAL DESTRUCTION THAT OCCURED BEFORE THE NO TECH OATH WAS TAKEN.
34 2. MORBY: I WAS NOT TAKING A SLAM AT YOUR WRITING, I WAS ANSWERING YOUR 
35 QUIRY ABOUT WHY CERTAIN PEOPLE WERE CONSIDERED GREAT. I DON'T REMEMBER 
36 SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT THE DEBATE PHASE OF BW TO BE BETTER OR WORSE THAT THE 
37 CURRENT PHASE, ONLY THAT SOME MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED GOOD WRITTERS 
38 CAME INTO BEING DURING THAT PHASE. INDEED, SOME HAVE CONTINUED THRU TO THE 
39 CURRENT CONDITION. I NEVER MADE ANY SORT OF COMMENT INDICATING THAT YOUR 
40 WRITTING IS POOR. IN FACT, IT IS GOOD. BUT DOES NEED WORK. ATTENTION TO 
41 DETAIL IS WHAT MAKES GREAT WRITTING. SPELLING, PUNCTUATION, GRAMMER, AND 
42 MESSAGE CONTENT.
43 3. TO PERSON SAYING THAT D/PAM ARE GOOD ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE WOMEN. I HAVE 
44 TO DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT. YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE ON PAM (NOW ON DB) NOTE 
45 THAT AS I INDICATED TO MORBY, IT HAS NO SPELLING ERRORS, PUNCTUATION IS 
46 CORRECT, THE GRAMMER IS GOOD. IT IS CONCISE, AND IT DOESN'T RAMBLE. IN 
47 SHORT, IT IS READABLE WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTING TO THE READER BY HAVING TO 
48 STUMBLE OVER ERRORS AND CONFUSION. NOTE THE ABOVE WRITING BY ME, HERE YOU 
49 HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF FAIR WRITING STYLE. THERE IS A SCATTERING OF SPELLING 
50 ERRORS, PUNCUATION IS HORID, AND GRAMMER IS POOR. NOT TO MENTION THAT IT IS 
51 DIFFICULT TO READ BECAUSE IT IS IN ALL UPPER CASE. ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND 
52 TAKING THE TIME TO MAKE SURE WHAT YOU WRITE IS READABLE IS WHAT MAKES GOOD 
53 WRITING GREAT.
54   AS I SAID, YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF PAM, NOT A GOOD STORY, BUT A REASONABLE 
55 SHORT EXAMPLE. MAYBE YOU CAN PERSUADE D TO LEAVE AN ENTRY TOO. SHE IS STILL 
56 AROUND, SHE JUST DOESN'T FREQUENT THE INN AS MUCH. DON'T YOU THINK A REAL 
57 ENTRY WOULD BE MORE SUITABLE THEN A HASHED OVER ENTRY FROM THE PAST THAT HAS 
58 NO RELAVENCE TO THE HERE AND NOW.
59 **************************************************************************
60 PAM: WHAT?! NEW BOARDER CLOTHES? WHAT WOULD ANALOG ALAN SAY? BUT THEN I 
61 HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND HERE FOR SOME TIME, SO I WOULD SAY YOU PROBABLY HAVE 
62 AS MUCH RIGHT TO CLAIM IT AS ANY. GODDESS EH? MAYBE WE SHOULD ERRECT A 
63 TEMPLE TO WORSHIP YOU FROM? MAYBE INSTALL A FEW VESTAL VIRGINS TO RUN IT?
64 SERIOUSLY, I AT LEAST DO MISS YOUR STORIES HERE, AND LONG TO SEE THEM AGAIN. 
65 I HOPE YOU CAN FIND AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO OCCASIONALLY SHOW UP.
66 PLEASE?
67 **********************************************************************
68 [*=*] : SEE WHAT A LITTLE BIT OF ENCOURAGEMENT CAN DO? A COUPLE OF THINGS I 
69 MIGHT SUGGEST TO MAKE IT MORE READABLE, TRY NOT TO BREAK WORDS AT THE END OF 
70 THE LINE, IT IS DISTRACTING TO HAVE TO TRY TO RECONSRTUCT THEM WHEN READING. 
71 ALSO, IF YOU CAN, LOWER CASE IS PREFERABLE TO ALL UPPER CASE LIKE THIS. I 
72 REALLY SHOULD USE LOWER CASE MYSELF, BUT IT HAS SEEMED TO HAVE BECOME A 
73 TRADE MARK. OH WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD CHANGE. PAM HAS WHY CAN'T I?!

76 Gee Mikey: I don't know what to say. Since you talked to our old friend
77            Hrothgar the A$, I hear that the CPMulator may not be the GodSend
78            I thought it might be. I guess this ADM3A terminal emulation
79            might be a hinderance considering Hrothgar will want to use
80            it with mainly with Kaypro software. But...pause for dramatic
81            effect, I may still have two IBM PC customers for you.
82            Regarding the McKane organization adventure, I sure didn't realize
83            you disliked spy stories. When our little group decided to re-start
84            an adventure by going after freedom's old nemesis, Leroy McKane,
85            we thought it might be a pleasant change from the fantasy
86            adventures that seemed to die out after a few weeks. We thought
87            that maybe people were interested in a change of pace, which the
88            spy novel certainly offers. If you look back at the infamous
89            "Kolumbia" adventure, and its terrible demise, and then at the
90            "Amber" series, and see how it quite quickly went down in 
91            flames, you can start to see a pattern. Again we hoped that with
92            a well defined villian such as McKane, and a well known history
93            such as the McKane organization has, we might get some of the
94            closet Ludlums to come out and take part in a hopefully successful
95            venture. After talking with another common friend, who shall
96            remain nameless, even though we both know who he is, I learned
97            about both his and your distaste for "cheap dime store detective
98            novels". Our unnamed friend thought BW at its best when embroiled
99            in a debate. And looking back at our famous schooling, taxes,
100            and of course the multiple religious debates, I can see his
101            point. It was a time when thoughtful contributions ruled the
102            roost, and the now-coined twits were few and far between. I
103            think BW has changed from that time. As you can see with the
104            "Frank" episode, people aren't ready to take opposing sides and
105            have a good old debate of old. Considering the subject though, I
106            and others I have talked to thought the entries by Alex and Piper
107            especially, while certainly establishing their points of view, were
108            just as good as ANY of the entries of old. I think it is unfair to
109            constantly compare the new users of BW to the old. The comparisons
110            do little to encourage new users, and certainly don't improve things
111            any, but instead make people mad, and possibly drive them away, which
112            I think is both unfair to them, and unfair to those who might want
113            to read and enjoy what these new comers have to offer. Where does
114            all this lead, well like many who enter long narratives, the
115            original purpose may have been lost, but I think a point had to
116            be made. To change the cliche a bit, "write and let write...". But
117            if my explanation of the McKane story is not sufficient, and we
118            continue to read complaints about how the "Inn is being taken
119            over" (don't you dare Aaron), I have a feeling it might die like
120            the other adventures, and I think that will be too bad. End of
121            another diatribe... I hope you responde with the same thoughtful-
122            ness I am accustomed to. And on a more somber note, we are 3/5ths
123            of the way there, and Aaron is going to try and contact the famous
124            Dragon Lady in order to secure funds. Aaron and I will be shooting
125            for this weekend to pay you. Thanks very much for your time and
126            effort on the 33 disks!

153 We seem to have several new contributers here, all of whom are definite
154 improvements over what has been common lately.  Laseter and M'Lan both
155 have good styles.  They pay attention to the details that Mikey mentioned in
156 the first part of this disk.  They have good use of adjectives, their grammar
157 and spelling is correct, in essence the type of entry I like to see.
158 [*=*] : the above applies to you also.  I would have to request that you
159 refrain from splitting your words at the end of lines. It is distracting.
160 Do you have a name or pseudonym we can address you by?
161 Morby: ignore the critics.  Your writing is good.  You have few spelling/grammar
162 errors, and your entries in defense of your style were well worded and showed
163 a good command of the language.  I have no problem with your offerings.
164 (except - since you compose your stuff off-line and upload it, justified,
165 could you set the line length to 64 instead of 65?  I have a 64-column
166 screen, and that last stray character is annoying.  Thanks.)
167 L'homme: you seem to have stated our case fairly well.  You covered the 
168 topic well enough that I now have to rewrite what I was going to say.
169 My next entry into the "McKane" saga will have to wait until I can review
170 what has been happening.  Also have to figure in Ian's rescue.
171 Ian:  thanks for rescuing us.  I am sure McKane appreciates your method;
172 your style seems to fit in with the type of writing he likes.
173 Grand D.:  One nice thing about BW (when it works, anyway) is that everyone
174 gets to do it their way.  I am going to take that to heart, and continue to
175 make my 'Joshua' entries as I have.  I like the long narratives.  They allows me
176 to make the points I want to make, and reveal the detail I wish to show.
177 The use of news bulletins and such is an interesting adjunct, and I may toss
178 a few into my stories, but I plan to depend primarily on the style I have used
179 to date.  It would serve no useful purpose to try to bend my writing to match
180 yours.  What enjoyment would there be if everyone wrote the same?
181 In fact, whether you interact with us or not is really irrelevant.  We have
182 managed to have fun getting to our present predicament without much assistance
183 from you, and I am sure we can continue to do so.  Don't take this as a
184 rejection, it's not.  I am merely stating that as long as there are a few
185 people making contributions to the story, it will continue.  The actual identities
186 of the contributors are not really important.  (a sort of communist viewpoint,
187 I suppose, but then, communism in its pure form is not a bad idea.)
188 All: The last two disks seem to be doing quite well; there are few twits, and
189 several new contributors.  Let's hope that it will continue this way.
190 Looking around, notice something.  Many of the best writers are not members
191 of a story, but rather make their entries as a kind of soliloquy.  Piper sits
192 there and makes comments and plays his pipes, but rarely participates in any
193 adventures.  When he does, he is still on his own.  Pam and d also
194 have earned their fame from their entries per se, rather than how well they fit
195 in with some story or other. Leseter, M'Lan, and [*=*] are so far solitary.  
196 I think some of the best writing comes from people not having to worry about how
197 well their entries fit in with what someone else has said.
198 I enjoy writing as a way of interacting with others; my skills do not stand up
199 to the challenge of being admired for their own sake.  Fortunately, others
200 are different.  That is what makes BackWater so great when it works, and
201 so sad when it doesn't.
202 I won't apologize for the length of this entry; it's something that I felt
203 a need to say, and since it is relevant to most of the users of BW, I feel that
204 it is appropriate here.
205 (I do apologize for the undoubted disjointedness of it, however; a consequence
206 of on-line composition).
207 Good night.

209 [*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*][*=*] (RATHER SNAZZY BORDER, NO?) 
210    IN MY CRAFT OR SULLEN ART
211            BEING
212 AN ESSAY ON THE ART OF WRITING
213 THERE ARE TWO ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS THAT CONSTITUTE GOOD WRITING. THE FIRST AND 
214 FOREMOST IS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMAND (NOT DEMAND) THE READERS ATENTION. 
215 ENGROSS HIM. THRILL HIM. SCARE HIM. (OR HER). MAKE HIM LAUGH. MAKE HIM WEEP. MAKE 
216 HIM FORGET HIS MOTHER IN LAW. MAKE HIM REMEMBER HIS MOTHER IN LAW. STIR HIS 
217 EMOTIONS. CAPTIVATE HIM. IDENTIFY WITH HIM SO THAT HE'D RATHER READ WHAT YOU HAVE 
218 WRITTEN THAN, SAY, WEED THE RUTABAGA PATCH, OR FIX THE ROOF. IT IS THIS QUALITY 
219 THAT PUTS THE AQUITAINE PROGRESSION AT THE TOP OF THE BEST SELLER LIST, RATHER 
220 THAN GROZAS THIRD EDITION OF ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA. 
221    THE SECOND INGREDIENT IS TO USE THIS ABILITY, WHICH REQUIRES A REASONABLY GOOD 
222 COMMAND OF THE LANGUAGE. ENGLISH, GREEK, WHATEVER. TO ARTICULATE. TO BE COMFORTABL
223 WITH WRITING AND EXPRESSING FEELINGS. TO FLOW, LIKE THE GENIUS WHO WROTE THOSE 
224 MAGNIFICENT STORIES ABOUT A MEDIAEVAL 'TRAVELS WITH CHARLIE', THE ANONYMOUS [*=*] 
225 TRAVELER WITH THE LOVABLE RACCOON COMPANION.
226   THIS ABILITY CAN BE INHERENT, OR IT CAN BE LEARNED. IN MY ENGLISH COMP CLASS, I 
227 LEARNED SUCH THINGS AS DICTION, VERBOSITY, (I PLEAD GUILTY), REDUNDANCY, CLICH'ES 
228 GRAMMAR, SENTENCE STRUCTURE, SYNYAX, INAPPROPRIATE METAPHORS, PUNCTUATION, ETC AD 
229 NAUSEUM. 
230    IN MY WRITING EXPERIENCE, I LEARNED TO UNLEARN MOST OF THIS DOGMA, BUT ALSO TO 
231 ADHERE TO CERTAIN PRINCIPLES THAT I CONSIDER IMPORTANT. THE FIRST OF THESE IS 
232 SPEALENG. IF YOU ARE A TERRIBLE SPELLER, THEN FORGET ABOUT WRITING, AND GO BACK 
233 AND LEARN TO SPEAL, OR TAKE UP SOMETHING LESS DEMANDING SUCH AS LAW OR BUILDING 
234 CHAIN LINK FENCE.
235 THERE IS AN INSTITUTION IN N.E. ILLINOIS CALLED THE SNICKERING SYCAMORES REST HOME
236 IT IS SUPPORTED BY THE WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA, AND ASCAP, ( THE AMERICAN SOCIETY
237 OF COMPOSERS, AUTHORS, AND PRODUCERS). IT IS AN ASYLUM FOR EDITORS, PROOF READERS 
238 AND TYPESETTERS WHO HAVE TORN OUT THEIR HAIR, GROUND THEIR TEETH TO THE GUM LINE, 
239 AND FINALLY GONE STARK RAVING STRAIT JACKET THEY'RE COMING TO TAKE ME AWAY MAD
240 TRYING TO SALVAGE AN OTHERWISE EXCELLENT MANUSCRIPT THAT WAS FRAUGHT WITH 
241 MIS SPEALED WORDS. 
242    ANOTHER PRINCIPLE IS PUNCTUATION. A GOOD WAY TO LEARN THIS IS TO TAKE UP 
243 TOBACCO CHEWING. (THIS HAS SOME BUILT IN INCENTIVES- YOU'LL DRINK LESS[DEMON RUM 
244 BEING THE NEMESIS OF CREATIVE PEOPLE], AND YOU'LL FIND THAT PEOPLE WILL START TO 
245 AVOID YOU, GIVING YOU MORE TIME TO STAY HOME ALONE AND WRITE. BEFORE YOU START, 
246 FIND YOURSELF A COUPLE EMPTY BEER CANS.(LOOK UNDER THE SOFA).SET THEM BESIDE YOUR 
247 TYPEWRITER. THEN BREAK OFF A CHUNK OF PLUG, POP IT IN YOUR MOUTH, AND MUNCH. THEN 
248 START TYPING. WHENEVER YOU NEED TO SPIT, TYPE IN A PERIOD. WHEN YOU START TO CRAVE
249 A BEER, DO NOT-REPEAT-DO NOT-REACH FOR THE NEAREST BEER CAN. INSTEAD, TYPE IN AN 
250 EXCLAMATION POINT. TYPE IN QUOTATION MARKS WHENEVER THE PHONE RINGS. 
251    THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO PUNCTUATION. CONTINUED LATER.
252 SYSOP: I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY "SEE WHAT A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT CAN DO" IF 
253 I DO TRY TO END EACH LINE AT THE END OF A WORD. AN EXCEPTION WAS MY ENTRY AT THE 
254 BOTTOM OF THE LAST DISC- I WANTED TO FINISH THE THIRD CHAPTER BEFORE I RAN OUT OF 
255 SPACE. I WILL NOT APPOLOGIZE FOR BEING TOO POOR TO AFFORD A COMPUTER THAT HAS 
256 LOWER CASE. I WILL ADMIT TO BEING TOO STUPID TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THIS TRS-80 
257 COCO DOES OR DOES NOT HAVE LOWER CASE. WHEN I BOUGHT IT, THEY GAVE ME THIS BOOK, 
258 BUT I LOST IT ON THE WAY HOME.  EN BEUA COUP FAUX PAS, C'EST NO?[*=*][*=*][*=*][*=

275 stood up to address the other patrons of the inn.

277 Hey your guys in the back! Pipe down! (sorry)
278 
279   Tonight, July 20, in the mundane world, a piobareached competition
280 will be held at David Douglas school in east Porland.  It will take
281 place at 7:30 PM.  If anyone wishes to hear what classical bagpipe
282 music consists of, and a selection of excellent pipers, I encourage
283 you to go.  Just show up in the parking lot.  You'll have no trouble
284 hearing where the competition is held.  (It does take place indoors
285 in an auditorium -- quite pleasant and the pipes sound good in the
286 space that they chose)
287    Tomorrow, the Highland Games will take up most of the day.  They
288 are usually a lot of fun, and I hope to see many of my old comrades.
289 This is one event that I can play my pipes and remain almost entirely
290 unnoticed!  I encourage you all to come to one or the other event.
291 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
292 PIPER -- THAT COMPETITION IS AT THE HORNER PERFORMING ARTS CENTER
293 AT DAVID DOUGLAS HIGH.  SEE YOU THERE

296 **********************************************************************
297 L'homme: Ok, Let's see if I can answer some of your querries and such. 
298 First, as for the Mckane thing; No, I didn't say dislike, I said I wasn't 
299 interested. (Some of the side issues I didn't care for though.) In fact, 
300 much of what GDM wrote I thought was good. It just isn't of interest to me. 
301 As I said sometime earlier, I get enough of the violence and power trip 
302 thing in real life, and would just as soon get away from it when I can. As 
303 far as the Kaypro/ADM3A thing, ahh well, as they say; "That's life". Let's 
304 see, what else. Oh yeah, the "Frank" thing, while I found the writing by 
305 piper and Alex OK, I would disagree with you about it being equal to the 
306 best seen. But that is because I don't feel that things like "You should be 
307 put away" ect. is a proper form of argument. They were simply dropping 
308 themselves to the same emotional level as the Frank person was on. The 
309 'because I don't think it is proper' is however as good an argument as any 
310 when the issue is basicly an emotional one as it was, though it does lack 
311 substance. When I complain about the Inn, I am complaining about the 'Inn', 
312 (you know, the one with the buildings and roads and trees.) and not BWMS. 
313 BWMS is a whole 'nother matter, and I always have and always will leave it 
314 open to full use (within the guide lines you know and stated in the 
315 opening.)  Just as you would take umbrage to someone missusing your 
316 character, I get uptight when someone missuses the Inn that I am comfortable 
317 with. What else? Oh yeah, the debate times at the Inn. While they were 
318 interesting, I too like a change of pace thus I also enjoy the fantasy side 
319 as well. I am just not into the my gun is bigger then your gun stuff. As far 
320 as 'twits' and 'juvies', I think you'll find when you get the back issues 
321 that they have always been with the Inn (and probably always will be) they 
322 come and go in cycles. Some of the more distastful stuff you won't see since 
323 it was removed before archival (ahhh...). Comparison to the 'greats' (yuck! 
324 that sure has become a badly miss used word around here of late!) I would 
325 agree with you. The refferances I gave were simply in response to a quiry, 
326 and not ment to be a weapon to hold over others that they must somehow 
327 emulate these people. That is a most rediculous prospect to be sure. 
328 Let's see, finaly we come down to the disks. They are here waiting for when 
329 ever you're ready. If Aaron has trouble getting hold of d, have him give me 
330 a call, I have a bit more direct method of getting in contact with her. 
331 (though only during work hours.)  
332 I guess that's it.  I might add that much of what I have said in the last 
333 few days is in direct response to inquires. And the responses given were my 
334 true thoughts and feelings. I realize that some of them may not be what you 
335 want to hear, but that's what you get when you ask. Perhaps I shouldn't air 
336 my dirty laundry in public? Oh well...
337 Did you know that 'Caucus' is an Indian word for PowWow? It is derived from 
338 'Cau-Cau-a-su' meaning advisor.
339 
340 C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre!
341 *************************** CISTOP MIKEY *********************************  
342 P.S. [*=*] : The comment about encouragement was in response to your comment 
343 about not putting anything on here because you thought no one would be
344 interested.  I was not compaining about your upper case, only inquiring
345 as to if you could use lower case instead. If you don't like the right
346 margin setting, you can change it with the 'MA 76' command (where 76 is the
347 desired position of the right margin. For readability on about 50% of the
348 terminals/computers set it to 76. For readabliity on about 60% of them
349 set it to 63. If your worried about eatting up too much disk space and
350 aren't as concerned about readablity, set it to 126. Alternately, set it
351 to what ever you feel like.

358      THIS COMMUNIQUE MAY BE A LITTLE DISJOINTED, BUT I AM SURE YOU WILL SEE
359      WHY AFTER YOU READ WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.
360 
361      I WAS VISITING MY SISTER IN TULSA WHEN I GOT YOUR COMSET MESSAGE. MY
362      BROTHER-IN-LAW SEEMED QUITE INTERESTED IN HEARING ABOUT SOME OF MY
363      ADVENTURES FOR THE NET, AND SINCE I HAD BEEN CLEARED TO RELATE ALL OF
364      THE OPERATIONS I HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN SO FAR, I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT.
365      HE SEEMED ENTHRALLED BY MY EXPERIENCES. WHEN I WENT A BIT TO FAR AND
366      TOLD HIM I WOULD BE GOING ON ANOTHER OPERATION SOON, HE PRESSED ME FOR
367      MORE INFORMATION, BUT I DID NOT YIELD. UNFORTUNATLY, HE FOUND THE
368      PRINTOUT THAT I HAD MANAGED TO FORGET TO DESTROY. REMEMBER, MY COMSET
369      ISSUE HAS A BUILT-IN EPSON PRINTER. ANYWAY, TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT,
370      HE SLIPPED ME A MICKEY IN MY FAREWELL PUNCH, AND ASSUMED MY IDENTITY.
371      SINCE HE HAD THE DECODED MESSAGE, HE HAD NO TROUBLE GETTING HIMSELF IN
372      A HEAP OF TROUBLE. MY SISTER TRIED TO WAKE ME, BUT WHATEVER HE GAVE ME,
373      IT HAS JUST NOW WORN OFF. I AM STILL A BIT GROGGY. SHE SAW THE
374      ARTICLE IN THE PAPER, ABOUT THE NET AGENT BEING FOUND NAKED, AND WENT
375      INTO COMPLETE HYSTERIA. I AM RETURNING TO NET CENTRAL, TO AWAIT 
376      PUNISHMENT, BUT I PLEAD WITH YOU TO GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE. I AM SURE
377      I CAN GET RID OF THIS WASSIR CHARACTER. I WILL BE VERY CAREFUL, AND I
378      WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.          <END OF XFER>

382 Mikey: Thanks for your response. I don't mean to argue a point, but I remember
383        many times in the past when the facade of the great debaters took a 
384        break and angry pure emotion took its place. But, as we have both
385        indicated before, those are times gone by.
386        I will try to have Aaron contact you. I apologize for the delay, but
387        let me assure you that the NET members of the BW buy were all prompt
388        with their payments, it is these OUTSIDERS who are delinquent!
389 Joshua:Another good entry, and considering how it came about! Online...shudder
390 All   :Some people seem to think that the PC&S get-together offers a chance to
391        the otherwise somber group of writers of BW to get blasted. We assure
392        you this is entirely up to the individual. No liquor is forced, and
393        pain rendering devices are not used to garner information from 
394        possible McKane operatives. All is quite friendly, peaceful, and fun.
395        The management has assured us quick and complete ejection if the
396        contrary should ever occur.
397 Piper :I lived next door to David Douglas for one year, and one thing has
398        always puzzled me. Where do all those cats come from, and why do they
399        keep coming back each year? (just kidding...actually I enjoy a good
400        bagpipe. By chance do you know someone by the name of Dean Forbes?
401        He works at the same place I do, and every sunny day he practices out
402        on a little grassy area. He has worn circles in the grass where he has
403        walked in a circle too much.

426 PORTLAND (AP)   Units of the Portland Police Vice Squad and Army National
427 Guard announced a daring midnight raid on Darcelle's XV last night.  
428 Arrested was the notorious Russian drag queen, Petrov.  Police state that
429 Petrov will be charged with Flashing to Persons of Indeterminent Sex.
430 Also arrested was a French speaking person known only as L'Homme sans
431 parity.  Mr. Parity is charged with First Degree Sheep Abuse.  Capt.
432 Henry Macho of the Portland Police said, "It was the most disgusting
433 thing I've ever seen.  The worst part was when that French guy jumped
434 up on stage and attacked that poor little lamb."  Trial for the arrested
435 persons will commence before hanging judge Wilbert Hardcase on July 26.
436 When contacted at the Sunnyvale Rest Home, the victim sheep, Fluffy,
437 could only bleat mournfully.

441   I now take space to appoligize for any offensive work that I have 
442 entered, especially of late.  My outcry was not meant to come across as
443 a angry one, but only of thoughtfulness.  My problem is that I write in
444 such a manner that is not agreeable with the set limitations of the Inn.
445 Comedy really doesn't go over well, and it will take a little doing for
446 me to alter my entries to poetry/prose.  Because of this, I will have
447 to stop my efforts and planning of the quest to save Blackpool.  
448   Already, two of the adventurers have expressed that they do not wish
449 to be included, and I have not heard from the others.  Therefore, I
450 will devise a clever way to end the storyline, and Morby will find a
451 unused corner of the Inn to haunt.  Maybe I will continue to upload short
452 stories, or work another character into the framework of this system.
453 Either way, this is my last entry under the assumed name of Lord Charles
454 Morby - Earl of Blackpool.  I just no longer wish to make the effort to
455 establish a storyline of my own, or even be involved in one.
456   Just out of interest, the vital statistics posted on drive B, are 
457 correct, although they are a tad on the harsh side.  Now I am just
458 wondering who put them there...

462 Worlds grow old and suns grow cold
463 And death we never can doubt.
464 Time's cold wind, wailing down the past,
465 Reminds us that all flesh is grass
466 And history's lamps blow out.
467 Chorus:But the Eagle has landed; Tell your children when.
468 Time won't drive us down to dust again.
469 Cycles turn while the far stars burn,
470 And people and planets age.
471 Life's crown passes to younger lands,
472 Time sweeps dust of hope from his hands
473 And turns another page.
474 CHORUS
475 But we who feel the weight of the wheel
476 When winter falls over our world
477 Can hope for tomorrow and raise our eyes
478 To a silver moon in the opened skies
479 And a single flag unfurled.
480 Chorus:For the Eagle has landed, ...
481 We know well what Life can tell:
482 If you would not perish, then grow.
483 And today our fragile flesh and steel
484 Have laid their hands on a vaster wheel
485 With all of the stars to know
486 Chorus:That the Eagle has landed, ...
487 From all who tried out of history's tide
488 Salute for the team that won.
489 And the old Earth smiles at her children's reach;
490 The wave that carried us up the beach
491 To reach for the shining sun.
492 Chorus:For the Eagle has landed, ...

498 "NO!", his master shouted, "You've got it backwards AGAIN! I want you 
499 to get it right. At the rate you're going you'll poison someone. And it 
500 might not be yourself!"

502 NEVER get back to the Inn.

505 UPI- Washington- The Justice Department today filed suit against McKane
506 Enterprises for violation of the Equal Opportunity Employment Act.
507 "They are engaging in religious discrimination. If they wish to continue
508 with their 'Rent a Miracle' service they will have to meet our quotas for 
509 religions represented." stated a department spokesman. 
510 "They have NO Jews, Moslems, Hari Krishnas,... In fact they only seem
511 to have Christians employed at the monasteries. And from only ONE sect
512 at that!"
513 So far there has been no reaction from Leroy Mckane or his counsel.

570 Portland - The recent story regarding the arrest at Darcell XVI of one L'homme
571 sans parity was in part, incorrect. When contacted at a telephone booth in the
572 vicinity of the Oklahoma City Fine Arts Centre, L'homme, as he prefers to be
573 called, denied all charges against him, and relayed to this reporter a bizzare
574 story involving a foreign imposter using his name, a bottle of sheep dip,
575 a tattered copy of an old Woody Allen film, and several copies of the PlayBoy
576 interview with Jimmy Carter. The story is currently being serialized for future
577 publication in the Oregonian.
578            "I just don't know why this keeps on happening to me!", L'homme said.
579 "I have been in Oklahoma City taking care of some business interests, and was
580  recently tied up in some important meetings with a group of oriental importers.
581  I wish who ever was doing this would stop. I don't cater to some of the sexual
582  perversions that my countrymen are known for. And I hated 'La cage aux folles'", continued L'homme.
583 As more facts are brought into view, this reporter will continue this 
584 interesting story.
