22 The Innkeeper looked around and saw the Inn filled with old friends 
23 and smiled. It was just like old times. A crackling fire roaring in 
24 the fireplace, a joyous banter and telling of tales and adventures 
25 echoed thru the Inn. The ever present Piper delighting a group of 
26 listeners with a new tale. Drawing even the fair Lady of Dragons out 
27 of the shadows to listen to his tale and respond with a beautiful 
28 telling of her own. Ahh, and what a very marvelous telling it is! 
29 And sitting at her accustomed table in a protected corner of the 
30 Inn, Pam speaks in twisted words and riddles talking in circles of 
31 redundencies and old tired phrases to those who would listen. 
32 Excusing those who won't. Working hard to tell a tale in need of 
33 telling, yet finding as great a difficulty in the telling as those 
34 who listen. Yet as she continues, the improvement is noticable even 
35 to the most inate listener. And she does attract her share of 
36 listeners. The Innkeeper smiles at this setting. Yes, it seems like 
37 old times, and he happily sits back to listen to the tales spew 
38 forth again. Perhaps even relaxing a bit and take a drink of his own.

46 the reality storm that broiled up as person made contect with object was completely

49 with painful effort, person concentrated upon object itself.  person closed eyes
50 and visualized object as a flat, pocket sized box with one control.  with fearful
51 uncertainty, person opened eyes.  object remained as envissioned.  keeping attention
52 on object, person waited as the reality storm abbaited.
53    What befell person in that reality is a story which may be told at some future

57 person found self by a roan tree near what appeared to be a mideval (whatever that
58 means) inn.  Picking up an odd peace of parchment lying on the ground, person
59 unexpectedly found self inside.

62 pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
63   The piper's eyes were dazzled by the flame that flickered from the candle.
64 Stepping over the mouse-rustled hay lying on the stable floor, he moved towards
65 the peagasus' soft whicker.  The odor of its animal occupants lay heavy in the
66 stable air warming the stable like a comfortable old blanket.  The piper stepped
67 up to the peagsus and stroked the long line of her jaw with a gentle caress.
68   As the pegasus replied with a quick shake of her head, the rustling of her
69 pinions nearly obscured the soft rustle behind the piper.  There was no 
70 mistaking the cool breath of night air that tugged at the exposed knees left
71 bare between the piper's kilt and the tops of his hose.  Shielding the candle
72 flame, he turned to see who or what had come into the stable behind him.
73   As the piper turned, his eyes, finally accustomed to the candle-lit shadows of
74 the stable, fell upon the pegasus' neighbor.  Stopping short his turn, he 
75 froze in place watching the dragon's movements.  
76   Some moments are endless.  During most persons' lives such a moment seldom
77 occurrs -- seconds stretch out into minutes, hours, days, years and eons.
78 Time itself, the unreeling of the fabric of what is, off the loom of destiny
79 slows to a crawl; and the circumstances leading to the present state take on
80 a new dimension of meaning.
81   So it seemed to the piper in those endless moments while the dragon's head
82 approached him.  He had ample time to appreciate the beauty of the dragon's
83 integument, fascinated by the play of light off the fine-cut scales that lay
84 in ordered rows like gemstones in a fantastic jewel-garden along her lines
85 and contours.  The bolt of adrenaline that had shot through his veins like
86 lightning had tightened his muscles to a painful state.  Normally one of the
87 most peaceful of men, he had been startled by an unexpected encounter into a
88 highly dangerous state -- galvanized by the "fight or flee" reflex into a 
89 state where he could exert hysterical strength.  In the manner of a
90 she-tiger protecting her young, the piper interposed his body between the 
91 pegasus and the dragon, obviously intending to protect the pegasus with his
92 life if necessary.
93   Rational though is farther from us than we would really like to believe.
94 Although we attempt to work our way through life thinking with our heads, and
95 ignoring the demands and contributions of the body, we are a single organism,
96 and respond as such.  In danger or stress, we react as we have trained our 
97 bodies to react.  The piper had been trained in a hard school -- the unexpected
98 more often than not represented danger.  It was a long moment after the 
99 dragon's tentative motion of greeting that the piper noticed the glow of
100 intellegence in the dragon's eyes and the hesitance with which her head came
101 forth.  Realization that the dragon had ample time, had it intended to cause
102 harm to the pegasus, softened the piper's taughtend body, and he laughed the
103 soft laugh of relief that rises unbidden to our lips in those circumstances.
104   He reached out his hand in greeting to the dragon, tentative to match her
105 hesitation, the slight draught that had caused him to turn forgotten.

138 the principal stands,
139 violin at the ready and
140 bow in her hand nervously wagging,
141 admonishing:
142 "No, not quite yet;
143 no, no, not quite yet,"
144 as her moment of glory approaches.
145 Bow touches string, and
146 her solo begins:
147       she coaxes recalcitrant notes
148       from the strings,
149       primly seducing the tune
150       from her balky instrument.
151       She is mostly successful.
152 The orchestra eddies 
153 and swirls about her;
154 at first she is determined
155 and stands her ground,
156 her note high and thin
157 above the others,
158 but the current grows
159 stronger and sweeps her
160 into its stream, there to
161 mingle with seconds in the
162 drowning of the closing notes.

177 Such a writing contest would be fun.  I wouldn't stand a chance next to the
178 ones mentioned above.  But the results would be interesting to see.  Would
179 they be put up at the Inn?  But what subjects are there going to be?  Is it
180 going to be on fantasy, romance, thriller, adventure or something else?
181 It would be great to be able to read the results of this contest!

189 	Ian, I know how fond you are of Ada, and how long she has been your
190 secretary, but I really think it's time you put her out to pasture.
191 Her efficiency is deteriorating, and an agency like ours cannot afford mistakes,
192 especially in a position at least as powerful as yours (since we all know
193 that it is really the secretaries that run the companies).
194 Her latest mistake was assigning me The Messenger as contact point.  Apparently
195 the poor dear can no longer read the telephone book, as it clearly shows that
196 639 numbers are long distance from my center of operations. (by the way -
197 it describes 639 as Tigard, not Lake Oswego, a possible source of the confusion,
198 as Lake Oswego IS a local call for me). In any case, an alternate secure
199 channel is now required.
200 	NET 02 out.

203 L'homme: Yes, despite my not knowing Tri-Mess bus routes well at all (no need to, really; you know how often I can
204 get into Portland), after a few moments of studying the maps and timetables at the stop I caught the right bus back to
205 familiar territory.  Transport the rest of the way was provided by The Doctor.
206 Your tour was most informative; I thank you.  The only thing I lament is not seening Chuck at RHC.  Oh, well.
207 By the way, as I was walking towards my intended destination from the bus stop, one of those Thrike agents had the
208 nerve to attempt to follow.  In a clear attempt to garner information, he struck up a conversation.  Applying reverse-
209 reverse-reverse-reverse-reverse (ad nauseum) psychology, I carefully leaked out information that wouldn't help his
210 grandmother, let alone Thrike.  It will be interesting to find out what happens to the information.  The Thrike agent,
211 apparently satisfied, used the pretense that he was late for a bus, then left.

222 Ada looked up Lake Oswego. She also mentioned that the only phone book
223 available at the time was a 1981(!) book. 
224         Isn't it a pity that the Phone companies & the Post Office (and
225 the legal boundaries) all disagree? 
226         The "easy" solution would be to see if the owner could be 
227 persuaded to get his number changed. Since they seem to be the "same"
228 office (63x), I am rather puzzled as to why it makes a difference in
229 the first place! (on checking the list of 63x #s I see that it is some
230 sort of "generic outlying area" prefix #%$^&).
231         One last thought. Just to satisfy my curiosity, how much IS the
232 charge for calling from your number?

260 Re: Trouble at the Office
261 
262 	Did you notice how Ada passed off her mistakes regarding the phone
263 book problem. This is very unlike the top aid in NET organizational oper-
264 ations. This can only reflect on our 'leader.' In the past few months, I
265 and other agents whom I have been in contact with have noticed a rather
266 distressing change of philosophical direction. I am unaware of the causes of
267 this change, but the effects remain. I propose, as soon as I am able to, we
268 meet, and discuss certain 'plans' of action. Until that time, I would advise
269 communicating only through top-level COMSET code, ie. the code given to you
270 when last we met, but not transmitted to NET HQ decoders.

274 KOSTA:It sounds like perhaps you could have used a ride anyway. I took the long, twisty route home myself, after
275 dropping Gaudy off. It usually doesn't take me nearly 90 minutes to get home from downtown, but Friday night it did.
276 Don't worry too much about second guy problems. As you can see, there was no reason to worry too much.
277 Movie Fans: 'Actually, I am his illegitimate son. Someday all his wealth will be mine, and we'll be eating lunch
278 together!'
279 Farley: Glad you made it home OK. What's this about Thrike being in the area? If I had known they were so close to
280 the 'building', I would have security doubled immediately. As for the tour, with a high visibility complex located 
281 so close, you can be sure the campus will be safe from attack. No one would be so foolish.
282 Mikey:Bad news again. I couldn't load those adventures onto the IBM. I think they were tokenized Sanyo BASIC, and 
283 I take it that is not compatible with IBM BASICA. Start over again? Copylink is working fine.
284 Gaudy M.: Looks like certain assist. coaches will be in rather low spirits. I hope YOU are not adversly affected by
285 such actions. Don't let it fool you for a second. Fight it I say! Fight it! Heh Heh. Looking forward to meeting all 
286 those jung living people next Friday!
287 ASP: Pleasure meeting you too. I had seen you around many times at PorSFiS, but I never associated the name with the
288 face. You are one of the people Mr. Grice will probably be bringing along to the demo at the BESC, whenever that
289 happens. See you again then...

300    "And didn't you have any faith in him Farley?" asked L'homme.
301    "Did you really expect me to?  I have a hard enough time trying to stay
302 alive let alone allow myself to get caught up in Philosohy 401.  So why 
303 should I have picked sides?  And how did that guy know so much anyway?"
304    "He came like a thief in the night," siad Fellows as he made himself more
305 comfortable sitting on the floor next to Farley.  It seemed that some people
306 can never tell when to turn off the sence of humor.  "You know, I was just
307 thinking.  You must think that this all looks rather foolish, all of us just
308 sitting here on the floor.  I mean honestly, grown men acting like a bunch..."
309    Fellows was cut short by a poke in the ribs from L'homme.
310    "Try to keep the chatter down will you?" he said as he then crawled over to
311 one of the smaller windows looking out the side of the cabin.  "From my short
312 glimplses I can't see any of the other agents that were accompanying Fleming.
313 Of course they could be in reduced numbers now that they may believe the cabin
314 to be deserted.  But we can't be sure, he may have ordered a detachment to
315 stay behind to clean up after he left."  At this Fellows just nodded.
316    "How long do you think we should stay inside then? For about another three
317 hours or so?" asked Farley in anticipation to be back towards a more civilized
318 environment.
319    "That would be a safe guess, but I suggest that we stay put until after it
320 gets dark. We wouldn't exactly be invisible in these dark colored city clothes
321 we've got on now," added Fellows.
322    "Good point.  Just what I had in mind, although if we wait until after dark,
323 it may be too cold for us to travel effectively for any length of time.  We'll
324 have to search the cabin for additional resources," noted L'homme.
325    "But what about that escape tunnel this Kosta or Coolidge or whatever his
326 name is made mention of?  Do you think he really had something like that put
327 into such a place like this?" asked Farley with a new hope.
328    "I don't think Kosta - we can just call him that for now - could have had
329 the time to have done such things.  On the OTHER hand, I remember Ian and Ada
330 discussing the aquisition and improvement of these new pieces of real estate.
331 Ada was mentioning something about interior decorating and Ian was busy trying
332 to remind her of the functionality needed for such occasions as these.  Boy,
333 I don't remember him ever getting so steamed up over something so trivial
334 before."  L'homme then rolled over and turned down the power setting on his
335 weapon before returning it to its holster.
336    "The place could do with a lick of paint though," said Fellows.
337    "And a couple af those frilly curtains. Don't you think?" replied Farley.
338    "Sheesh! You guys... Sometimes...."  L'homme was going to put an end to the
339 horse play, then he remembered how humor aided in survival to help in keeping
340 one's wits when under stress.  #Fellows is doing this for Farley's sake...#
341    "C'mon guys, it was your idea to look for that tunnel. No time like the
342 present!" finished L'homme.  Now picture three NET agents scurrying around
343 on the floor like a bunch of puppies.  Tis truely a foolish sight, comrades.
344 KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA KOSTA
345 L'homme:  I'll return to the 'common' names.
346 Farley:   Yesss!  A Dark voice that is Crystal clear? Or, might it be...

393         being the elitest and stuck-up group that we are (naturally), we have
394         kept files as to who we have sent out official applications to.  It
395         would be needless to say that only a few of these have returned, but
396         so have many new "self-proclaimed" neophyte xeroxes.

445 	Minsky was coming out of the cabin, waving a white flag. She was led
446 down the road for about half a mile when Fleming stopped the party.
447 	"This is far enough." barked Fleming. He gestured at us, "You three go
448 over and search her."
449 	As we moved up, John started smirking and called back "Should we do a
450 FULL BODY search, sir?".
451 	At this suggestion Fleming nodded. "Yes! And remember, if she gives you
452 ANY trouble - even the slightest resistance - shoot to kill!"
453 	Minsky's face had gone white. It took me a second to put it together
454 with the smirk on John's face. FULL BODY search, I realized that Minsky had
455 recalled the same thing... the page in the manual seemed to jump at me...
456 	... due to the risk of hidden weapons on dangerous prisoners, all body
457 cavities must be probed THOROUGHLY. A wide variety of weapons and contraband can
458 be concealed in the rectum (and in the vagina). Other bodily orifices should
459 also...
460 	I snapped back to the present as John spoke again. "Mark, you cover us.
461 George, you check her clothes. I'll do the rest." He leered at her and said,
462 "All right, sister, outa them clothes! Now!"
463 	She yelled at Fleming, "What is this! You're going to search me NOW?
464 And in the damn SNOW!!" She was yelling loud enough to be heard a mile away.
465 	Fleming replied quietly, "Yes, here and now. You've got thirty seconds
466 and then I'll shoot you. Since you surrendered, maybe I'll only shoot you in
467 the foot..."

524 THOR sat quietly in his wooden chair near the corner of the INN and looked a
525 about at the people around him. He had seen many of them before during one of
526 his visits to the INN and he had learned a few of their names. L'homme, hmmm..
527 possibly a french name but there was no accent. And KOSTA, surely a slovic basis
528 but again no accent. THOR saw also the agents of NET and listened quietly as
529 they talked of their adventures and of their love of right over wrong. He saw
530 Farley, Gaudy, Fleming, Leonard and 
531 noticed that a few were not here today.
532 No, there was a few missing. Marci, Tina and Tony, where could they be. THOR
533 did not fret over their absence for he knew that their void was missed and with
534 this missing would surely materialize their presence for all to share. THOR did
535 not speak out to any but only watched as they kept their constant rhubarb of
536 tales and stories and he was happy to see the overseer, CISTOP MIKEY, over at
537 the bar keeping a watchful eye out for any who were in need of a guiding word
538 or friendly gesture. THOR felt warm inside with so many good people here at 
539 the INN and his heart swelled to twice its size when he finally spied the one
540 called kathyd. Yes, thought THOR to himself, here was one that beauty only 
541 chose to stay in second place behind the radiant personality and charm that 
542 showed themselves in this special one person. Here was one that could melt 
543 a word let alone a look. The trip to the INN was well worth it and now with so
544 many with so much around him THOR felt he could finally relax and enjoy. It was
545 not an easy task for such an old gladiator like THOR to do. To relax and enjoy 
546 the company around him and to not have to worry about attack or self 
547 protection. Yes, it is good here at the INN and I am glad that I have made it
548 here tonight. It was a long road to travel and the route was not easily accessed
549 ath easier and here I can be happy.

552   "Jack, there is something we have to talk about" Marci spoke softly to Jack
553 who was brushing his teeth in the bathroom.
554   "Oh, what's that?" came a muffled answer.
555   "It has to do with THE END of the line." Marci was in the front room,
556 looking quite ravishing, her coat was on though and her purse over her 
557 shoulder.
558    Jack walked from the bathroom, dressed in a blue bathrobe, freshly shaved
559 and smelling good. He was alarmed to see his girl so fully clothed at this
560 time of night.  "Marci, what's wrong? can't we talk about it?"
561    Marci spoke softly. "Jack, the story is over, your usefulness has been
562 outlived, we must go our seperate ways."
563    Jack was stunned, his fantasies of sailing away with Marci into the
564 sunset were sinking fast. He tried a last ditch effort. "No I won't leave
565 you, we have been through to much to give up now!" He grabbed her shoulders
566 and kissed her passionatly.
567    Marci broke his hold and stepped back turning, she opened her purse.
568 Raising a nickle plated handgun she took carefull aim at her lover.
569 "It's over" she replied as she pulled the trigger.

572 This entry is for the one that backons himself the god of thunder.
573 THOR:  It seems that thou hast not the ability to differentiate between the
574   dimensions of the multiple zones known to us mere mortals as "realities".
575   Some users of the BackWaters are just that, Users.  Nay, I intend that NOT
576   to be an insult, only a fact.  Some are given the title "patron" if the 
577   zone their characters inhabit is that of the fantasy nature, that of INISFAL.
578   Then there are those that partake in the more cruel zone, as I, that which
579   likens itself to the modern world.  I, KOSTA, have not, nor shall I, endevor
580   into the likes of the Inn.  It is just not to be for I am one that is not
581   capable of such a venture across the zones.  Some are able, I am not.
582   As to those that are not present:  they are present on their on home zones.
583   Worry not over their absence, they will appear if they are able.
584  
585  
586 Ian Machinery:  May we assume then that Gaudy is still fully garbed?
587   *I* for one will not allow such slanderous action to take place before me,
588   I would rather be shot down than allow the defilement of one so fair take 
589   place before me.  Those curs!  Lowest of all possible "Junior Agents"!
590 For those encompassed within these events:  I will assume that the events that
591   have taken place shall be continued from where *I* have left off unless
592   informed otherwise from a face I recognize.  The pizza we have shared, and 
593   the lunches we have enjoyed together have taken up too much valuable time to
594   allow such vile degadation spoil our combined efforts.
595   Or has my battle waged within Bulgaria forced me into a time where change has
596   taken place within our structure without my knowledge?
597 So many questions, so little time for conferences.

602      Once I finished emptying my flagon, I permitted the lid to shut with its
603 familiar clink.  This usually gave warning to the Innkeeper that I would either
604 be ready for yet another of his masterpieces of brewing, or that I might even
605 actually be once again on my meager way- off into the chill of the late night
606 cold.  Ever so slightly I bent my head to seek out a vision of the Innkeeper
607 standing behind the counter with watchful eyes.  He was not to be seen.  Then,
608 as my gaze returned to the object before me, the sight of one so bold caught my
609 attention.  Yes, he did seem to have an aura that attracted many a man's 
610 attention.  Although not know to me personaly, his form was of that which could
611 not be denied.  He was an Eternal, he was Thor.
612      I had decided that to speak with one such as he would be too much for me
613 to consider.  As I rose, his head tilted in my direction.  His eyes met mine,
614 our gaze was locked.  After several moments, I felt as if I would walk away
615 with him knowing all there was to know of my simple existance.  Yet this did 
616 not happen.  I wanted more to speak with this being, I decided against it.  As
617 I started once again for the well worn door that sheltered us from the harsh
618 outer world, I noticed Thor begin to stir within his seat as if to stand. I
619 froze in place within my boots.  Time seemed to stand still before me, not a
620 cell within the fiber of my muscles would function.
621      "Could this be the workings of the one so great?" I thought to myself.
622 For thought alone was the activity I could muster in the state that had now
623 come to be.  "Surly an Eternal would be capable of such a feat."  Then another
624 more clear thought came to mind.  "If time were to stop for all but one man,
625 that man would have to be Chronos himself!"  My face wanted to show the image
626 of excitement and confusion I now felt but was not permitted.  I still was not
627 able to move.  Then, from nowhere, an hourglass obstructed my vision at a close
628 range.  "Think not so little of yourself. For you are a Guardian, are you not?"
