23 I stood looking at the small pile of dirt in my palm, wondering 
24 if I had made the right decision. Perhaps, and perhaps not, but 
25 now it was too late to change my mind. Suddenly I felt dizzy. I 
26 quickly stepped over to my cot and sat down. The room began to 
27 whirl around me faster and faster. It started to turn blue, then 
28 yellow, then red. Finally it went completely black. A,l sense of 
29 reality was gone. There was only nothingness. My god I thought, 
30 what have I done? Then slowly my vision began to clear. But it 
31 was better, sharper, clearer than ever before. And a familar 
32 voice in my head said "You again!  But how? The only way that we 
33 can be sperated is through your death. How can this be?" Hey, 
34 don't ask me, I don't know. All I remember is you pulling that 
35 switch and having the whole world blowup around me. Maybe I did 
36 die, I don't know. At any rate, we are here agian, and like it or 
37 not you have me to contend with. "And just where" said the voice, 
38 "is here." Why the Inn, of course, my place of rest for wiery 
39 travelers. And we have a problem which I hope that you can help 
40 solve. "And what might that be." responded the voice. "Let me 
41 show you." I said and got up, unlocked my door and walked out 
42 into the main room of the inn. Heading over to the curtained 
43 doorway, I pulled the curtain aside revealing the brownish 
44 metalic door. There you go, it appeared a few weeks ago and has 
45 refused to reveal its secrets to the most adept of our people. 
46 What do you make of it. "Ahh... I haven't seen the like of it for 
47 eons. Yes, I know what it is, but it isn't something that can be 
48 easily described. It is a doorway to another universe, another 
49 existance. I can show you the way if you wish." I don't know, I 
50 remember all too well what happened the last time I went trapsing 
51 off into the unknown. "It won't harm you I assure you. Here, put 
52 your hand on the small oval in the middle there." Where did that 
53 come from? It wasn't there before. "You just couldn't see it 
54 before is all. Remember, I give you more than just a voice to 
55 talk to." I placed my hand on the oval tenatively and felt a 
56 small tingling/sucking sensation. "Now think of where you would 
57 like to go. Think slowly, carefully, clearly..."  I thought of a 
58 field of grass, warmed by a gentle sun. A chorus of small birds 
59 gave a melodic background of music. A small pillow of moss to 
60 cradle my head. As I stood there thinking of this, I did not 
61 notice as the door began to glow and turn into a rainbow of 
62 colours, then slowly the chill draft that always ebed about the 
63 Inn's floor began to subside and a warm gentle breeze slowly to
64 replace it. How long I stood there I don't know, but the next 
65 thing I knew I was laying in that field I had been thinking of.
66 It was so comfortable, so relaxing that soon I was fast asleep.  
67 How long I slept I don't know, but I awoke more refreshed then I 
68 had ever felt before. The sun still shown overhead seemingly in 
69 the same position as when I had fallen asleep. A dark shadow 
70 passed overhead, but was gone before I could look to see what it 
71 was. But then I could see that something was falling, catching 
72 the sunlight in small flashes of white as it drifted down. It 
73 landed beside me in the grass, a large white feather. Not the 
74 sort found on a bird, but something larger. More like that which 
75 would be found on a different sort of flying animal, one that had 
76 been stabled at the inn in the past, a flying horse.  Could it 
77 be? The chances of such a thing are so small. In all the know and 
78 unknown universes why here? And who is to say that it is even the 
79 same one. After all there must be others. "You know this flying 
80 animal?" the voice in my head said. Yes, I said, I think I do.

83 A long time passed before I woke.  I think.
84 I lay upon a dark rock, one of many strewn about the particularly dreary
85 landscape.  My body ached.  My attire was far from being in good condition.
86 I made an effort to sit up.  Dizziness and nausea.  My vision blurred.
87 "Dwhat ess itss?" a low, raspy voice asked.
88 "Dhunno, Yob.  Nuht whun uhf Peepul."
89 "It ghud tuh eet?"
90 "Dhunno.  It muhvss."
91 I tried to find the source of the voices.  "Hello?"
92 "It sspeekss.  Dwhat ar yuuu?"
93 I shook my head, to clear it.  I instantly regretted it, as it only woke up
94 a tiny little man in my head.  The one with the sledgehammer.  He wasn't happy,
95 and demonstrated this by proceeding to use the sledge on the sides of my
96 cranium.  "I'm a...er...human.  What are you?"
97 "Eerhuumaan?  Weeell, eerhhuumaan, wee ar Peepul.  WhI yuuu ar heeer?"
98 The talk was becoming more intelligble.  I shan't try to reproduce their manner
99 of speech anymore; instead I shall just go on as if they spoke educated English
100 of the current period.  My difficulty with their language was not too great,
101 but it was quite a change from the educated tones of Cragmore as we had chatted
102 back at the Inn.
103 "I'm here by accident."
104 "Accident, he says.  You arrived in pillar of flame from the sky.  Green
105 field below charred.  Where are you from, that you travel in fire?"
106 "I don't, normally.  I am from Celene, orignally.  I just left a place called
107 Innisfal in a hurry."
108 "Some hurry.  We have never heard of these places.  We have roamed the all.
109 Where are they, if not in the all?  Yet nowhere in the all but here have we
110 seen a Erhuman, either.  Are you normally red on outside?"
111 "Red?"  I felt my face and head.  My hand was stained bright red.  That landing
112 I had made was definitely not a three-pointer.
113 "No, I am injured.  And weak.  And generally otherwise feeling terrible."
114 "Do what you can to heal yourself, while Yob and I send for help for you.
115 Nowhere on all would stranger be refused this, even if not of all.  Rest."
116 It was not difficult to follow their instructions.  I tore makeshift bandages
117 from my robes.  I had felt worse.  No bones broken, it seemed.
118 After my efforts at first aid were completed, I became drowsy, and rapidly
119 fell asleep in a strange land called All...

122     Emu almost choked on his mouthful of brew.  He had seen a brief, worried
123 expression cross the mage's face, then a flash of light that popped the eyes.
124 By the continued rumble of background talk, Emu knew that he was the only one
125 to see Milchar's hasty, uh, exit.
126     "Cragmore!"
127     No movement.
128     "Cragmore!"
129     Oh geesus, Emu thought.  Now what?
130     Next thing Emu saw was the faithful innkeeper, walking straight towards
131 the mysterious door.  "Sir Keeper!" Emu called, and recieved no answer.  By
132 this time,  Friar noticed Emu's plight and put the kitten down.
133     "What's up, Emu?"
134     "Friar, I think we've got sudden problems, all at once.  First Milchar
135 disappears in a flash of light, with a distinctly worried look.  Then
136 Cragmore goes catatonic.  Now, look at the Innkeeper, like a zombie at that
137 door."
138     That's when the innkeeper fell.

141 I had just finished an enchanting conversation with a man called Strange 
142 But True in the Back Room labeled DB, and set the scarred kitten down on
143 Piper, when a flash of light struck the Inn.  Lightning ?  Red Lightning ?
144 Then I noticed Emu sitting up straight and looking pale.  "What's up, Emu?"
145 I asked.
146 "Friar," he replied in an agitated tone, "I think we've got sudden problems, all
147 at once.  First Milchar disappears in a flash of light, with a distinctly worried
148 look.  Then Cragmore goes catatonic.  Now, look at the Innkeeper, like a
149 zombie at that door."
150 I turned to look at the Innkeeper, and at that moment he slumped to the floor.
151 "Quick, Emu, Help me with him."  I jumped to his side, and caught him before
152 his head could smash down on the hard stone floor.
153 "Let's carry him back to his room.", suggested Emu.
154 "Right."
155 We carried him back to the Innkeeper's quarters and found the bed under
156 and behind stacks and stacks of scrolls marked "aRcHiVeS".  We laid him
157 gently down, and listened to his heart, pulling a stethascope from my bag,
158 along with a corn beef sandwich, which I handed to Emu.
159 "He is alive, and strong.", I said.
160 "Look, he is even *smiling*!", exclaimed my friend.
161 There being little for us to do for him, I left Emu with the Innkeeper, and
162 fetched to tankards of ale, and a pitcher as well.  It was going to be a long
163 night.
164 Finding no change when I returned, I asked Emu, "Do you want the corned beef ?
165 Or would you prefer Pastrami ?"

183 A question put up for debate.
184 Situation - a state Legislature has defeated a proposal to make Martin
185             L. King's day a state holiday.
186             The outgoing governor then decides to take it into his own
187             hands and declares it a state holiday, thought he doesn't
188             have the legal authority to do so in that state.
189 Question: Should the new governor try to continue the "moral leadership"
190           shown and risk being sued by the State's Attorney General, or
191           should he follow the law and recind the Executive Order, to
192           and give it to the people to vote upon later?

197 Friar: Jungian interpretation is a practice where dreams, both waking and
198 sleeping, are interpreted using Carl Jung's philosophies as a guide. The
199 practitioner of the interpretation is very well versed in Jungian philosophy,
200 and applies it the the words and symbols present in the dreams to make some
201 sort of sense out of it. A Jungian outlook on dreams includes the strong
202 belief that the dream state is equivalent to the subconscious state, and
203 active dreams are communications between the subconscious and conscious. 
204 It appears that during r.e.m. sleep, and during waking dreams or intense
205 day dreams, that the channels between the two levels of consciousness are
206 open. It is believed that except for Eastern mysticism rites, the dream is
207 the only way for Western man to learn from his subconscious. Out of body
208 experiences are considered incredibly intense dreams, and are equivalent to
209 hyper-communications between conscious and subconscious levels.
210 
211 It is the interpreters jobs to read the dreams and OOB experiences and
212 relate them to the subject using conscious level terms. Symbolism and
213 collective experience come in to play here, but I unfortunately don't have
214 the time to go in to that now.
215 
216 Could you tell me a little about why you are researching OOBE? I find it
217 a fascinating subject, more so because of my own personal experiences. I
218 hope I can help you. Perhaps when your research is done you could share
219 some of your more germane findings with me?

229 If your research is taking this direction, a read of some of the older
230 C. Castenada (SP) may be worth your while.

234 Ya, Interested Party, so am I.  Boy I can't wait for the debate to
235 begin.  Sure is a delima.  Who knows what the Gov. should do.
236  
237 ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
238 Yes, I read about that in the paper. One thing, though, a legislature is 
239 almost a given in voting aginst any new holidays, because of the intense
240 lobbying pressure that is brought to bear by the businessmen aginst new
241 holidays. Cuts into profits, you know.
242    On the other hand, the general public is almost always in favor of 
243 observing a new holiday, so an incoming governor will incur public wrath if
244 the holiday is not sent to the voters. So, the new governor will send it to
245 the voters, who will approve it, therby annoying the businessmen who will
246 be unable to blame either the governor, or the legislature.
247    This kind of debate is not really fruitful, because no one ever takes 
248 away a holiday, and sooner or later Luther's birthday will end up a holiday
249 so what will talk change?   I would much rather get back to the interesting
250 adventure that this tripe interupted.  
251     In the future, when you pick a debate topic, pick a topic with a little
252 depth, instead of just grabbing something off the evening newspsper rack.

280 SBT- Of course I will share my findings, if that is acceptable to our

283 
284 Mr. Interceptor - When I was growing up, there were two holidays in February,
285 now there is one, if you get that one.  (I do not.)  There have been occasions
286 when holidays have gone by the wayside.  Mayday was at one time observed
287 quite a lot, but it has fallen into disrepute due to the communist assertion
288 that it is there holiday.  Arbor day isn't celebrated any more.  (Why ?
289 Because you don't send Arbor day cards, so the greeting card people have
290 given us 1. Grandparents day, 2. Boss's day, 3. Secretary's day, 4. etc, etc,
291 ad nauseum.)
292 
293 All - The biggest drug runner in the U.S. is the U.S. ?????  You have
294 got to care about this one.  Why in hell didn't Ronny 'Just say NO' ???
295 I am appalled.  And disgusted.  And frightened.

299 Friar - You knee-jerk reactionary. Cynicism is just plain dumb. Try looking
300 at the peice over again. You just might find that members of the crew were
301 running drugs on their own, for their own profit. If you like to think that
302 President Reagan has no integrity, you like to delude yourself. Playing on
303 the natural fear of being near armageddon is a poor tactic to rile up
304 people. Yeah, you're frightened. Because a pilot who made regular trips to
305 Central America brought pot and cocaine into the States, you're frightened.
306 Bull. How about you are a close-minded and exagerative essayist without
307 the insight to see past the imaginary conspiracies you like to write about.
308 That one about greeting card kartels gradually weakening hollidays that are
309 not based around giving a card to someone, that was just funny. Maybe you
310 should stick to tongue-in-cheek essayism. It might result in less blatant
311 opinionatedness.                                                   - Thomas

322 Er Ted, I mean Mr. Interceptor, why don't you just calm yourself, and while
323 you are at it, apologize for your impudence. Any legitimate attempts at a
324 dialogue on this system should be met with favor, not the reactionary flames
325 you find so easy to spring on us. If I start a discussion on the arms/drugs
326 deals mentioned above, am I guilty of headline snatching? I think not. So
327 calm down and act a little more respectable to your fellow users of

332 Thomas is not Mister Interceptor. Neither is he or she named Ted. Guilt for
333 flaming Friar liked that should not be placed on either of those names. As
334 far I can tell, he wasn't upset that Friar asked about a newspaper article
335 in the hope of starting a discussion. It seemed to me, at least, that he was
336 really upset that Friar had turned personal corruption into a plot sponsored
337 by the President of the United States, to become the biggest drug importer
338 in the United States. I found the article. I am sure it sums up the situation.
339 It was not a massive importation at all, nor was it sponsored by the White
340 House. Friar did exagerate and appeal to emotions in his paragraph. It was
341 a very emotionally strong paragraph. It ticks me off a bit to be manipulated
342 over such a simple affair also. Those flames were left without much chance
343 for Friar to respond in any way however. They were ill-considered and should
344 be apologized for. Maybe a lesson could be learned, on both sides.

346  was an ordinary night at the club. Acting as a host was a second
347 nature for me at that point. Wandering from the tables to the kitchen and
348 even greeting people as they rose out of their cars was how I spent my
349 evenings, and those evenings were spent in style. If nothing else, those
350 nights were done with a flair and in a fashion no night club has ever managed
351 to recreate. Even the rapid beat and sultry lyrics of the jazz were never
352 assembled again in the same way they were arranged in those days. To think of
353 it, it was not only my functioning as the owner that made the club so
354 unusual. It was the rest of the gals and pals who ran the place, and of
355 course the people who strode in though the front doors as a hat check girl
356 took their overcoats and fur coats. Whatever made it so spectacular, it was
357 just that. A spectacle.
358 	One night, she arrived. With a stern young boyfriend. He had an
359 accent that startled our hat check girl as he spoke to her. It was obscure
360 and she guessed later, in my office the following evening, that it was from
361 England. She rode her spiked heels in regal fashion, and he followed closely
362 behind her golden dress. Her face was flush and she had aged quite a bit in
363 the year since we were divorced. No matter. She had a stern look in her face
364 that demanded respect and she got it from me. I had said that I loved her,
365 and I felt the same admiration for her as anyone feels for the first girl
366 they ever love. He fumbled with his necktie as they were seen to their table.
367 I was leaning against the rail above the floor and could plainly make out the
368 details of their conversation by reading their lips.
369 	Of course the were nervous. Her flush face had shown me that, but
370 that he was frightened of my reaction was news. He told her he would prefer
371 to fence than manipulate the courts as he was. She listened to him with a
372 deft ignorance that could have been either banal disinterest, or a wary
373 lookout for me. It was as I descended the stair that she spotted me and
374 turned to him. I could not see their lips then.
375 	I leaned over her shoulder and asked them both to leave. She looked
376 up with grim determination and said no. Despite the calm and charm I had
377 tried to pass along with the request, she icily refused to leave. Signalling
378 for the help of two waiters, I asked them once again to leave. It was as the
379 waiters came to stand near the table that the fellow handed me a fold of thin
380 white papers. A quick look showed me that this was a contract that would sell
381 control of the club to this fellow. I almost tore it up when he handed me
382 another. A continuance of our divorce suit, by which she could claim the
383 place was half hers, as property acquired during the marriage. I tore them
384 both in half with a static noise like an untuned radio.
385 	He stood up, insulted. I punched him, and picked her up out of her
386 seat by her arm. He regained his feet and I hurled the girl at him. She
387 looked frightened enough to run. Resisting the urge to beat him senseless, I
388 had the waiters escort the two of them out the front doors and throw them
389 out. Picking up the peices of paper, I assured the stunned customers that
390 everything was alright. I went up to my office to go ring up my lawyer.

399 i I have often had <dreams> in which I was doing any number of things but
400 the odd thing was that the <dream> would be like watching it all happen
401 from a third person point of view and not first.  that is, I saw things
402 through someone else's eyes.
403 I've never been able to tell just what thoes <se <dreams> have meant, if
404 anything at all.

409 	It had been a while since I had actually relaxed so I wasn't quite
410 sure I would be able to. Andrea was the best person to turn to whenever my
411 life needed "spring cleaning".  I sat in the easy chair rather rigidly
412 and was unable to get comfortable.
413 	"Drink your tea and tell me what you've been up to." she said, smi-
414 ling.  I met Andrea six months ago at a concert, her seat next to mine, We
415 started to talk then she invited Jo and I to dinner.
416 	"I haven't been up to much," I sipped my tea, "Just livin' day to 
417 day.  Haven't had much to do since the MuTAnts broke up." I took another
418 sip and felt a little more relaxed.  I sat back. "Actually Josephine's 
419 weighing to heavily on my mind latly.  I don't know why, I mean we were 
420 only lovers for two years..."
421 	"Naturally you feel this way," she said softly, in a sad voice,
422 "I fet that way when Geoffrey died..." she paused to sigh softly and take
423 several sips of her tea.
424 	I felt now was a good time to change the subject befor one, or
425 both of us, started to cry.

431         Where was I when I heard?
432         Well, I always stayed in the attic for days at a time. Even during the
433 Winter storms and the Summer heat. While there was only a heater designed for
434 a single room in an aging ski lodge, and the only windows were meant for light
435 and not for fresh air, the design of the place was perfect for long stays. The
436 stairs came up into the middle of the place, and around that platform were
437 three gables, windows at each end. Outside there was always ivy and through
438 that, the skies.
439         Not owning much furniture, the place was sparse. A futon and a modular
440 computer were opposite one another. Over to one side was a stereo system and a
441 television. Tapes were placed on any available surface and in peculiar wooden
442 crates, about the same shape as card catalog drawers from the library. As for
443 clothes, those were set out around the futon to be selected later.
444         For one important day, I had chosen charcoal pants and a strange shade
445 of sky blue for a shirt. No one else had seen me that day. Not even the school
446 girl whose parents had rented me the attic for the year. It was near a
447 college, and I was taking a few courses in programming there. As far as they
448 knew, I was using my phone line to do my homework with the computers at Reed.
449         What I was doing instead was using the computers of a nearby
450 accounting firm. During the previous year, I was hired by them to write a few
451 safeguards into their system which should have prevented anyone from tampering
452 with records which they should not have. Actually, the only significant work I
453 did for them was ask a locksmith for help in switching their computers off
454 with a key at night. In any case, part of my fee was a lasting account on
455 their machine. It came off alright. From what I hear, a few employees quit as
456 soon as they found out I would be watching over them for a while. It was a
457 fine reference for the resume I had never done.
458         It was the same firm which had administrated the accounts of a lady
459 named Sorpe. Walking from my parking place to the house early that morning, I
460 had found her diary in a garage sale, an estate sale actually. She had passed
461 away a few days before. It was easy as far as reading them, although it was
462 scary to even imagine as truth. She either insane or a liar, even in her
463 diaries. Each of the three volumes was about an assignment her father had
464 during the early Thirties, or so they purported to be.
465         The first diary was written in Austria in the last months before it
466 was absorbed into the Third Reich. Her father had been an attache who was not
467 so loyal to his Austrian heritage although he was suave and savvy enough to be
468 necessary in the workings of the Austrian affair, on the side of the Reich.
469 Once it had reached the final stage, he was given a high post in the
470 propaganda corps of the Reich.
471         Her second diary told of his assignment to the German embassy in
472 Brazil. His post was largely to sway the military of that nation to the side
473 of the Reich, and against the other great military powers in the Western
474 Hemisphere. Every soldier wants to fight. Fighting a war with the United
475 States and Canada was within the realm of possibility for that South American
476 nation. An invasion of the United States from the East Coast, and the capture
477 of the Panamanian Canal were planned out in detail. Since the Japanese were
478 involved in these strategies, it was obvious as I read that the military
479 elements of all three nations were dead set on beating the States.
480         His assignment was over only after a junta was organized that would
481 stage a coup and start a war effort. His assignment was an overwhelming
482 success. I am not sure why it never came about. At least it did not. Their
483 plan might have worked after all, especially with the help of the Nips and the
484 control of the Canal. It was frightening, just as I said it was.
485         As for the third, it was done as the war was closing. Her husband was
486 found in the first blocks of Berlin by the Red Army. As with anyone in a
487 German uniform, he was mutilated beyond recognition. She was raped again and
488 again, and thrown on a heap of dead German soldiers. Her diaries could have
489 been novels of incredible depth. Sights, scents, colors and personal
490 observations were astute and born out by the events of the months that
491 followed. Once she made her way to the States, a fortune in confiscated Polish
492 and French wealth was signed over to her by financial elements of the defeated
493 Third Reich in the Swiss Alps. Settling in the placid area of Portland, she
494 remarked that it was much like her Austrian home. The last pages were torn
495 out. I presumed her life after that point was something she did not want to
496 compare to the life she had lead with her husband in the illustrious days of
497 the Reich.
498         Alright. When we last checked in on me, I was logged into the
499 computers at the accounting firm I had worked in during the Summer. Neatly
500 evading my own safety alarms, I found out what Lady Sorpe had been doing with
501 her money. What was in the electronic documentation was a total surprise. Her
502 finances were way above what she had hinted at. After the war, over thirty
503 million dollars had been signed over to her by those financiers. Since then,
504 she had invested it and her total wealth in the early Eighties had reached
505 more than four hundred million. Her estate had not been a rich one. Her
506 personal belongings had been rather modest.
507         Then I noticed why. Before she had died, she bought a ton of
508 Brazillian bonds. Which was just months before. As the idea began to dawn on
509 me that she was completing her husband's work, the civil defense warning came
510 over the stereo. Loud. And that is where I was when I heard the invasion was
511 underway.

518 So. What do you think of the Brazil Invasion story, or any of the other fiction
519 which has gone without mention here? Gr.
520 @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
521 I think its wonderful to have people writing things worth reading again (I
522 mean there was before, but not nearly as much)  I particularly liked the 
523 Brazil Invasion story, I hope it gets continued.
524 By the way, what happended to the other story (you know, the door, the
525 inn, all that stuff)?????

554 Well, perhaps I was being a bit reactionary.  For that I apologize.  I do
555 not really feel that Ronnie was the mastermind behind any drug plot.  I am
556 quite certain that he is not the mastermind behind much of anything.  He
557 has been an admirable president, for his time.  It seems that presidents
558 of late fall apart around the sixth year.  Is this the Lame Duck Syndrome ?
559 Should we change the term of the president to one six-year term?
560 Again, sorry for the 'knee jerk reactionarism', but remember that 2 months
561 ago, he said 'there have been no arm sales to Iran.'
