31 ACT OF MERCY
32 (Part 3 of 3)
33 by John Silverman
34  
35    Seven o'clock.
36    The TV was on low, playing some idiotic sit-com rerun. Mother was napping. Tim was sitting in the front room, writing
37 in a small spiral-bound notebook:
38    "I write this now as I don't think I'll get a chance to express my thoughts later and I want to tell my side of the story
39 I only hope somebody will be willing to listen."
40    "It started a year and a half ago. I was young and stupid then. I argued with my parents a lot. The neighbors a block
41 away could hear every word we said, so loud were out fights. One night, I was mad about something, I now forget what, and
42 and had started a particularly loud row. I didn't notice that Mom was quieter than usual, Dad was more than making up for
43 it. I finally called him a son of a bitch and said I was leaving and never coming back. Dad hit me, hard. Mom screamed 
44 and collapsed on the couch.I was too hurt and mad to notice. I walked out, my Dad yelling that if I took the car he'd have
45 the cops after me. There were people all up and down the block watching the show. I yelled back at him to go ahead and 
46 drove away."
47    "An hour later I calmed down enough to realize I couldn't leave because I didn't even have a job. I was going to 
48 college at the time and didn't have the time for one. Finally I decided I'd better return home and face it. When I got 
49 there, an ambulance was pulling out of the driveway. My Dad was standing in the doorway, staring at it like he was in shock.
50 I asked him what the hell was going on and he said Mom had just had a stroke. Then he proceeded to tell me at length about
51 how it was my fault. I finally couldn't take any more and just ran away into the night."
52 of recovery. The best we could do was take her home and try to make her remaining time as comfortable as possible."
53    "Right after that Dad started drinking. That's where most of this mess came from. He started missing days at work, too
54 drunk to get up on time. He never missed an opportunity to tell me it was all my fault. He punched me out more than once.
55 He really was a son of a bitch."
56    Tim stopped a moment to wipe a tear from one eye. Remembering this was no fun at all.
57    "One day he got in his car, drove off, and that was the last we ever saw of him. Can't really blame him. My only real
58 regret was that I didn't think of it first. But I didn't so I'm stuck."
59    "No Dad, no money. The insurance couldn't or wouldn't cover everything. School went out the window and I got a job at a
60 nearby market. Every penny I make goes into this house and all the bills, and still they send collectors around periodically.
61 Every month we get farther behind."
62    "I have been a breadwinner and nursemaid for over a year now in a situation I never wanted in the first place. Maybe
63 this is my fault, but I think I've paid my pennance. This house is a rathole because I'm simply too tired or too busy to
64 keep it up. I'm just too tired. I cannot get a decent job (I need to stay close to home), School is still out, hell, I 
65 can't even dream of having a social life. No more. I have to change things, and this is the only way I know how."
66    "The family will probably renounce me. My few friends and aquantances will probably be shocked. I just want it understood
67 that I simply cannot come up with any alternatives. The quality of life for me cannot sink any lower, no matter what I do.
68 I have made my decision, and I refuse to regret it."
69                                                                  "Timothy Corbett"
70    He looked it over. Not bad, for a confession. It pretty much summed up everything. He got up and waded though
71 the garbage to the stereo. He put on his favorite album and started it, making his way back to the chair. For almost twenty
72 minutes he listened to the music. His attention caught on one particular line on one of the last songs: "I might as well
73 be (yper as long as I'm still around/I'll have plenty of time to be low-key when I'm six feet under ground." He had to laugh
74 at that. In fact, it was the funniest thing he had heard in a year and a half. He laughed until tears rolled down his cheeks.
75    When he finally quit laughing, he heard Mother, "Dear, I'm thirsty. Could you please bring me some punch?"
76    "Sure, Mom." He was still wiping his eyes as he went into the kitchen. The Jug had a little in it, about enough for two
77 drinks. He set out two cups and filled them. He pulled the bottle out of his pocket and poured a measured amount into one
78 of them. His heart pounded in his ears as he did so. Despite all his resolve, he was still scared. He had studied this 
79 particular chemical and knew it would work quickly and painlessly. He did not want to have to deal with unnecessary suff
80 ering. Making damn sure which cup was which, he carried them both into the bedroom.
81    "Here you go." he said, handing her her drink. "I propose a toast." He declared.
82    "To what?" she asked.
83    "To life." He said simply. He tapped his cup against hers and drank deeply. After a moment's confusion, so did she."
84    "This tastes funny." she remarked.
85    "Yeah, it's the plumbing. Something's wrong with it. makes the water taste strange." He could taste it, too.
86    "Will you be a dear and have it looked at tomorrow?" she asked.
87    "Sure." he replied, knowing perfectly well he wouldn't. "I'm gonna go watch some TV, OK?"
88    "Sure," she said, laying back. "I feel kind of sleepy."
89    Tim stopped at the door and turned around. "Mom?"
90    "Yes?"
91    "I love you."
92    "I love you too, dear." she yawned.
93    Tim waded through the mess back to his chair. On the way, he flipped the record and played the other side. He sat down
94 and picked up the notebook, setting it in his lap. He closed his eyes, lost in his favorite music. It was twenty to eitght.
95    At eight o'clock the phone rang. Seven rings later, a sleepy voice called out, "Timmy, would you please answer that? 
96 It must be my mother and I can't reach it in here. Timmy?"
97    "Timmy?"

125 It would help very much if you left your name, the type of computer you own and the baud capabilities of your
126 modem.  Also, where you live, so I can suggest LOCAL BBSs. Nevertheless, here are a few of my favorites.
127 +++++
128 BackWater, of course
129 Bit Bucket 254-xxxx 300/1200 24 hrs

134 RainForest 245-xxxx 3/12/24  24 hrs
135 <Tanis      761-xxxx 300/1200 24 hrs
136               Notes:
137 An EXTENSIVE list can be found on Bit Bucket(Runs for eight printed pages), so I suggest you call them first.
138 Also, most BBSs do have lists of other BBS numbers, so always look for that option.
139       Hope that helps,

190    Well, I have been asked by the Sysop
191 of K.I.S. Net to find potential places
192 that the writers of TANIS might be
193 hiding while the TANIS b-board section
194 is being written.  
195    I figure this is as good a place as
196 any for writers with not much to do. So
197 those that either can't get on here to
198 often, or have a story and can't wait 
199 for TANIS to get going again, there is
200 another alternative. 
201    Yes, the old Alternate World has 
202 gone, but it it's place has risen a new
203 and better thing known as K.I.S. Net.
204    It has all of your favorite features
205 including a B-board, and soon to come
206 an XMODEM file transfer section....
207    Give it a call when there is nothing
208 better to do. You will be surprised at
209 the progress that the sysop has made on
210 changing over from a (GASP!!!) Illegal
211 format..., But don't let that scare you
212 away, the system is completely legal 
213 and he even voice validates alot of
214 the time...
215    Anyway, give it a call, it's 
216 777-xxxx same number, different format.

228      Things seemed to have quieted down a bit, so the InnKeeper 
229 wandered out the front door to get some fresh air for a moment. 
230 Stepping outside, the fresh rain scrubbed air felt good as I 
231 drew a deep breath. Looking around, I noticed that things hadn't 
232 really changed all that much from so long ago. 
233      It seems like it had been ages since first obtaining this 
234 establishment as a dwelling, and later opening it to the public 
235 as a meeting place, and later at the urging of a good friend, as 
236 the Inn. It's hard to believe that it really has only been a few 
237 short years. 
238      So much has happened, people coming and going. Some gaining 
239 interest and others losing it. The always prevelant arguments and 
240 fights that occur in any public place. The friends, and yes, even 
241 the enemies. The stories, the tales of adventure and intrigue. 
242      Wandering out into the courtyard, my feet lead me of their 
243 own accord towards the small foot-bridge that crosses the stream 
244 flowing nearby. Leaning on the railing, I think back on the 
245 memories that it brings, times of old. What has happened to the 
246 gentle adventures of those days, where have they gone? What new 
247 quests do they pursue? Unknowingly my eyes turn to the Rowan tree 
248 growing outside the Inn. Scared and hagered, but still standing 
249 proudly. Planted there so long ago. 
250      Ah, Pam, my old friend, where have you gone? Off on some new 
251 trek? Keeping the tables of another Inn clean? Will I ever see 
252 your words again? The Rowan tree yet grows there still. Reaching 
253 inside my worn cotten shirt, I pull the locket out, still there 
254 imbeded in the glass is the small twig of the Rowan, given in 
255 promise of not leaving. An anchor to ward off the doubt. Ah my 
256 friend, what cruel winds have driven you from this land?
257      The surface of the stream ripples, and the reflection of a 
258 full rising moon echos times long past, and I am looking through 
259 another's eyes, of another time. 
260      Turning away, I place the locket back inside my shirt, and 
261 head back to the Inn. Stepping inside, it seems so quiet, it is 
262 empty somehow without this old friend. Going behind the bar, I 
263 pour myself a drink from a bottle from my private wine stock. 
264 I can't drown my depression, but maybe I can at least avoid it 
265 for a while.

270 Hmmm..

272 OKAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!FINE!
273 I go to call the famous Bit Bucket, the one that we have all heard
274 so much about, but it just sits there when I connect.  not a sign
275 of life to be seen.  Nothing that I do can spring it into life.
276 Is this the system that is so popular?  I gues it leave A WHOLE LOT
277 of room for your personal imagination!  Personaly, I like a system
278 that will communicate with you, even if it is telling you that what
279 you are saying doesn't mean a thing to it.  SO! if you haven't guessed
280 by now I would like for someone to tell my in detail how to get the
281 Bit Bucket going like it should.  Sitting watching a blank screen
282 has gotten on my nerves!  especialy since that if I don't call pretty
283 soon my password will be dleted again and THAT really gets me pissed!
284 OKAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!FINE!
285 
286 !!!!!!!!!!!!
287  Sadly, purposefully, FINE your problem may be your quickness to anger
288 and lack of proper settings. Try again! It maybe your were calling in
289 as the system was trying to call out....or you just may have negleted
290 to give it the c/r's it needs to set baud and parity.....
291                  the newcommer
292 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
293 OKAY!!!FINE - I called Bit Bucket today and received the same response as you.
294               As I am NOT a neophyte, I presume that the Bucket is experiencing
295               another of its all-too-frequent down times again.  Patience.

300      When last seen, our hero(ine) was disguised as a Japanese earmuff salesman
301 on a doomed flight from Portland to Australia (via the unscheduled and 
302 unfriendly skies of Albania).  Unfortunately for Petrov, the unsavory sort who
303 chose to exercise their freedom of expression on the flight in question had an
304 odd penchant for hanging humans of Japanese descent upside and down and naked
305 over porcelain bathing devices.  The surprising fact that the airplane was 
306 somehow devoid of such objects would have been a favorable one were it not for
307 the ingenuity of the hijackers who found a suitable substitute in another 
308 traditionally porcelain mechanism occupying a small room towards the rear of
309 the craft.  
310      The ensuing drama proved to be too shocking and terrible for the hijackers
311 to recount, but witnesses report that Petrov seemed to enjoy himself as his 
312 captors removed his dress and associated feminine attire, discovering his true
313 colors.
314      No one knows what caused the Airplane enroute from Australia to Albania to
315 crash into the recently rebuilt Oklahoma City Hilton which was celebrating its
316 grand re-opening after an unexplained explosion devastated the building in the 
317 summer of 1984, but Petrov's survival was, to say the least, neat.
318 
319      Thus begins a new chapter in the life of Petrov.  Before we proceed, it
320 must be understood that no telling of Petrov's tale could be complete without
321 an adequate understanding of my own; and if Petrov's story is actually a
322 confession, then mine must be too.
323      My name is Mitsubishi Cannelloni and, as my name suggests, I come from a
324 long line of Jewish hot dog salesmen.  After the fatal crash a bruised and 
325 battered Russian stumbled out from the wreckage and walked by me.  I never saw
326 him again, but I heard the airplane story from another survivor of the crash.
327 Indeed, Petrov's life would have been radically different were it not for my
328 timely intervention!

344 ////////////
345  The Cafeteria was crowed when Donna and I arrived and it was task
346 enough to get food , let alone make good selections as we passed through
347 the line. Now to find a place to sit! Ah , a table with two empty seats
348 and a familier face. It was Michael, the new imaging tech and a young, 
349 female in white. He was gesturing to us to come and join him. As we took
350 our seats he introduced us to a new intensive care nurse. Al, Donna, I
351 want you to meet Susan.... hmmmm I heard his words through the din of
352 lunch time noises but somehow they did not sink in . I was studying the
353 lines around her mouth and the dark bangs above her green eyes....
354    Like waves rolling in on a peaceful shore , my heart rose and sank
355 as she began to speak of her life. A child, my spirits sank, father on the
356 east coast, my heart jumped, boyfriend up north, I felt dispair, did not 
357 see him except on weekends, hope sprang up. As I was asked questions about
358 my own role here and my life's interest, I felt a warmness in my face.
359 I was blushing!
360  All too soon, my pager sprang to life...trauma code team was being called
361 to the ED.....! Life is never fair but timely...

364   The scene in the pell-mell was mass confusion.  The unconcious piper had
365 gone into convulsions, and was twisting and writhing like a freshly-beached
366 trout.  The lady who was found with him was also unconcious and bleeding 
367 badly, with two of the company bent over her.  Some of the adventurers
368 were trying to move the machine from this perilous realm, others to minister
369 to the needs of the wounded.  Many of the rescuers who had ventured out on
370 the surface were feeling less than fully fit.  Although brief, a soujour
371 in that place brought the body's metabolism to a complete halt -- restored
372 only reluctantly when they re-entered the pell-mell.
373   Without, the scene was less comprehensible.  The bizarre vehicle floated
374 some small distance above the black surface, moving slightly due to some 
375 slight imbalance in the propulsion units.  The black pavement stretched off
376 into infinity on each side, unmarked except where the piper and the lady
377 had vowed their suicide pact.  There, where the blood of the two had mingled
378 and dripped on the pavement, something seemed to violate the strange laws
379 of this unusual place.  It seemed almost like a solid cloud -- the edges
380 diffusing into the general glow of the surroundings, but dark within.
381 Unmoving, the smudge marked where the piper and the lady had lain, where
382 the very fabric of the two reality bands had frayed, where the sharp
383 demarcation between the two realities broke down and mixed the two in an
384 inchoate stew.  Slowly the pell-mell drifted into this zone.

394      You need not look through the eye's of strangers dear inkeep. Remembering
395 the eyes and hearts and souls of friends is much more pleasent. It is true I
396 have ventured far and wide since I last visited the Inn, but your calls of
397 lonliness have tugged at my mind and they have brought me back to the place
398 I will always call home.
399      Fear not that you have caused my departure from the place of the Rowan
400 tree. It is in my heart that I glide away from the Inn, only to return when
401 I hear a friend call. I have travelled far and wide, but I never forget the
402 one place that I call home.
403      I too remember so much of the past, and I strain to keep those lovely
404 memories alive when my senses are besieged by so much anger and contempt in
405 the air. I strive to remember the past, but I temper my strive with thoughts
406 and hopes for the future. To dwell too much in the past is to live a life with
407 no future. I can not face such a life, for I need the excitement and
408 uncertainty of unknown futures. I will never forget what has transpired here
409 at the Inn,. I will fondly remember good times sitting and talking with many
410 a great visitor. I made friends I will never forget. Dearest Innkeeper, you
411 too are my friend.
412      I will come this way again sometime. I don't know when, I only know I
413 will. I will not pass by the Rowan tree without taking a sprig. I won't
414 pass by the Inn without stepping inside and greeting all who are present. I
415 will come back and see you, if for just a moment.

419   On the way down the hall my mind was speeding through memories of
420 another girl. As impressed as I was with the one I just met, I was 
421 just sick about the one I had just said goodbye to. She was small,
422 brown haired and brown eyed. To me, the absolutely perfect person
423 to just stare at in awe. I was at the stage where I could think
424 of her without wanting to die, but just barely. 
425   No one gave me a glance when I entered the Emergency room. On
426 the second stretcher a code was already in progress. I grabbed
427 a syringe , found a thready pulse, and drove home the needle...
428 My job is so much fun! We worked on this patient for an hour with
429 no perceptable result. Tiredly, the ER Doc said,'that's enough and
430 shuffled off to see his next patient. Back in my office, work was
431 waiting for me. I grabbed the dirty equipment which was my
432 responsibilty and left the Emergency Department.
433  It wasn't as though I did not have enough problems in my life
434 without falling in love. It wasn't as though I really thought 
435 this newcommer would give me a second thought. It wasn't as 
436 though I was over my last love, or free from my current one.
437 But somehow I knew Ii was about to seriously complicate things
438 again.

443 "The dream, The Dream.  Let the fresh aire fill you with
444 new and tranquil thoughts.  Cast aside doubt."  The voice was a shallow one
445 and difficult one to hear.  I was not of this place, yet still I heard.
446 "The dream?  But this is the dream.  What... why?"
447 There was no further responce.  Now I will go to sleep and put reality be-
448 hind me.  Perhaps, one day, I might return.  On that day I shall be fully
449 prepared to listen for the voice that doesn't exist.  I will have to seek
450 solice in others until that time.

458 one of them. For certain, all those who are interested in other BBSs will
459 call other BBSs and they will see your long messages there. CBBS/NW would
460 be a perfect place to put them. There are some who may not care about any

463     Please excused my frusterated lack of tact, but coming to visit the Inn

470   as always, trainor's words were spoken with sincerety, hope, and the 
471 altruistic manner of any great spokesman.  one thing that needed remembering
472 was although he is a representative, he also is the only remaining survivor
473 of his civilization.  his effort and vitality to see us through had given me
474 more than just a little bit of confidence in myself.
475   "we are adults here," he had once said.  "what we do here, we do for all.
476 if anything goes wrong, we learn."  i had looked up to him from the moment i
477 set foot inside the inn.  that had not changed.
478   now i am faced with an actual task that only i may take on.  before me lies
479 the body of the other person we found in the unknown.  both the piper and
480 this one had slipped into the icy coldness of their own black sleep.  while
481 all around the pushing and pulling of sanity and reason strived to exist.
482 the others and i clammered back to our sanctuary of the pell-mell.  once
483 returned to the mechanized marvel, minds began to settle as others prepared
484 for some miraculous departure from this hideous reality.
485   once regrouped with emu, trainor would learn all the details discovered
486 within the last several minutes.  the others had gone to their seperate corners
487 and compartments, or were carried there to regain their energies -- both
488 mental and physical.
489   in a seperate compartment from the rest are the two women.  i am now to
490 become the protector of this lifeforce known only to us as zeb.  alone in the
491 stillness of a closed room, hearing only the faint breaths over the silent
492 air supply, i survey this being.
493   small and young in apperance, she is not unlike myself.  i carefully pulled
494 aside the electro-blankets and the grey robe that covered her.  her wound was
495 a simple one, except the position so close to the heart made me fear that her
496 life came close to an end.  it was definitely self inflicted.  i wondered how
497 she had indeed managed to live after it.  i threw the now crimsoned fabric
498 away from the wound completely and bagan to administer what little bedside
499 manner and medical aid i could.
500   with that finished, i drew the blankets snuggly up to her chin to keep her
501 body warm.  her mind would be another matter, what i could do for her there
502 was beyond me.  no...  it was only almost beyond.
503   ever since we had arrived within this final plane of awareness, i despised
504 the thought that i had a mind that could be responsible for deeds beyond the
505 ken of normal man.  what disturbing feats were now possible?  tp?  esp?  obe's?
506 curled into a little ball across from the relaxed figure i decided to chance my
507 newly realized 'gift' with her.  if i could look into her thoughts, maybe even
508 her dreams, i just might learn something about our present prediciment.
509   remembering how emu and cragomre had taken their places for the original
510 sitting in the circle, i uncurled myself and sat with my back aligned with the
511 smooth surface of the wall inside this compartment.  i took a few soft breaths
512 and tried to clear my mind of everything other than zeb.  i soon felt the
513   i soon felt the gentle touch of drowsiness tug at my sensabilities.  through
514 my closed eyes i saw a light shine over us, the prismatic light of a rainbow.

518   It had been a while since the sounds of battle faded away, and suddenly we
519 notice that the sweat covering us makes the night seem cold.  The fire near us
520 is burning still, but fading slowly.  It gives light but no real warmth.  There
521 is but one blanket, and we huddle beneath it in exhaustion.
522   The normal barriers evaporate into the clean air along with our sweat.  For 
523 the moment we have set aside our weapons and the light conversation that is 
524 really just politeness.  The words come fast, pushed by the fresh scent of 
525 battle.  We talk of youth, fear, family, lost loves, and recent scars.
526   Finally the cascade of words turns to a trickle, then to nothing.  We lay in 
527 comfortable silence, eash lost in our own thoughts.
528   Eventually she turns to me, and with a sudden smile, she grabs my hair and 
529 pulls my lips to hers. 
530  
531   The battle begins again.

577 Well now! We have an imitator in our midst it seems. The entry above (lines
578 393-417) supposedly by PAM is not by the PAM we know. Those who do know her
579 will quickly see the differences if they study the entry. Simple things such 
580 as that she uses 76 column entries not 80. And her grammer and spelling are
581 far better than that shown in the indicated entry. Another thing that was 
582 pointed out is that it is "eyes" not "eye's". It was a fair simulation however,
583 and obviously caught a few people. I wonder why though that someone felt that
584 they had to speak for her?

587 "Be careful, now, Milch.  I don't want a zombie on my hands.  Besides, what
588 would I do with Grann?"
589 "You'd teach him all of your degenerate mannerisms, that's what.  Don't fret,
590 Doctor, this probe won't be dangerous.  Besides, with this little powerpack,"
591 I patted the pile of argentium before me, "I have enough energy available to
592 get out of any trouble I can possibly get into."  I lowered my voice so no one
593 could hear.  "If I can channel it all without burning out."
594 "I'm still worried, but I'll live.  Arriving at optimum contact point in
595 twenty seconds.  Start doing your stuff, Grann.  This had better work, Milch."
596 "It will."  Grann began the ritual for planal shifting.  I was proud of his
597 progress- not many pupils could hold up under the acid-test conditions of the
598 past few days.  To think that this all started with a little trip to gather

601 "Arkady weldalan irisculdo durocawdi buratin!"  My surroundings faded out
602 slowly as I sat cross-legged on the floor of the control room.  I was a point
603 of thought floating in a black void.
604 Concentrate.  Points of light appear slowly, turning the void into the
605 appearance of deep space.  Each little point represented an intelligence, an
606 active mind.  Push harder.  Motion begins, not in any real sense, but my point
607 of view shifts and nears the outlet of the convolution.  The points darken and
608 fade entirely.  Entry.
609 A stomach-wrenching pull, vertigo.  Incredible speed down a round shaft of
610 color and light.  I try to slow, but I am caught.  There is no harm yet, so I
611 do not fight it.
612 Slowing down, exit.  Greyness first, then a wash of crimson and then I am
613 through.  A flat plane of black material, embedded with millions upon millions
614 of little flecks of light.
615 A strange machine floats above the convolution.  Perhaps cause of disturbance?
616 Possiblity noted, action when more data appears.  I scan the craft.
617 Life exists there.  Intelligence shows itself.  No surprise, craft shows
618 exterior examples of... well, let's not go into that.  Ahem.
619 Reaching, reaching... Contact.  He is aware of me.  Mental Shields up quickly.
620 I pause, and send a quick "mindprint" to allow him to identify me.  He returns
621 one.  Cragmore is his name.  Concern floats on top of his mind, for a friend.
622 Name...name... leaks through shield, concern is too strong.  Pi...Piper?!
623 I drop all of my defenses.  #I am Milchar, or at least a projection.  Perhaps
624 I can offer a means of escaping this zone.  The convolution will serve as a
