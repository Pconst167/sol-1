 51 CLANGCLANGCLANGCLANG reverbed in my ear.  "My (fill in the blank), what
 52 have I done?"  The 'path' between my own dimension and this one folded
 53 around me like an origami trick.  I could 'feel' my body to dissolve, and
 54 at the same time, my 'body' to become more solid...which resulted with
 55 my arse on the floor with a thud. (OUCH!  Blast It!) "Friar, what have I
 56 done?  To ignore this place?  My original mass has been converted to
 57 energy!"  I tried to stand up as I reeled (sp) from the spirits in my
 58 'body', and finally managed to do the charleston with the stools as
 59 I toppled to the bar.  Slowly, surely, my mind cleared.  "Something is
 60 happening!  The Realities are being torn appart!  Although I still have
 61 my powers," as I floated another stein to me, "my 'material' body has
 62 ceased to be!  I am now a thought!  I can not die - not in the same
 63 way you and I know!  For as long as I think, I shall be!  But this does
 64 not mean I can't be destroyed - only transformed.  Enough of this
 65 nonsense.  We must organize, Friar!  A party to re-join the dimensions
 66 and the balance of The Realities!  Lord Beaker, Resident God, I call
 67 upon you for help, and ask for your assistence!  Kurfur, appear now!"
 68 as there was a flash and Kurfur stood in full Beserker Dress "and
 69 others, please!  This is it!  The future of the realities depends
 70 upon us all!"  Kurfur did not look pleased - his supply of smurfs was
 71 stale from waiting for me.  I blushed, and renewed his supply with 
 72 fresh smurfs.  (AAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUHHUUUAUAUUUH) I screamed as part
 73 of myself became smurfs.  "I must be careful..." as I fell a third
 74 time to the floor.  A word formed in my mind:  Orb.  I tried to
 75 recall my memory of any Orbs, but nothing came as of yet" Suddenly, I

 81   Appologies (sp) to everyone for my absenteism (sp again, ack!), but
 82 much has happened.  I left this weekend to meet a yound lady of well-
 83 known aquiantence, and I also saw an older man sing songs that would
 84 not compare from when he was younger and when he sung them.  And this
 85 man took the name of a painfull wound, and he had a guitar player who
 86 almost managed to pull his guitar strings about 80 feet off of the stage
 87 from the strumming... anyway, the concert was a dud!  Sting has lost
 88 his edge, and cuts more like a pencil than a knife.  Too bad - must be
 89 burnout at his age...where are you, Police?  Have you retired on
 90 pentions? (sp - my mind has not been exercised)

123 "Kurfur, appear."
124 Mumble mumble. "Wassit dis time, another summoning? Guess I've got no
125 choice but to respond."
126 Time shifted. The flow of the continuum drew me from the shores of 
127 unreality, and I drifted with the current. In the eternity which lasted
128 a millisecond, I thought of this new summoning. My mind reached into
129 the passing eddies and drew forth Evilbane. Then, I remembered my offer 
130 for questing assistance.
131 "So, I have finally been called. Took 'em long enough. Nearly had to get
132 a fresh supply of Smurfs."
133 I now knew where the summoner was. Using my imagined imagination, I 
134 steered my course through the warp-flow to the edge of nowhere. Imagining 
135 the inn, I made my way to it, pocketing Evilbane into the ether.
136 Once I was inside and fully material again, I immediately recognized the 
137 summoner as Hagbard Celine (mostly by the fact that the guru wasn't to be 
138 seen).
139 "Wassup?" I asked to the assembled party. "Must be something big.
140 The continuum has twisted again. Change is imminent. By the way, could I
141 have some grilled Smurfs. Temporal movement makes one hungry, and I'm 
142 all out of them."

183 My senses were still numb from the improper melding with the orb
184 , What Certam had told me ran through my mind. My thoughts gained clarity
185 , and I came to a deccision. I must return to the place were all of this
186 had began.
187  
188 I left the building were the orb had lain and move out the gate.
189 I travelled rapidly and carfully to the place I had been when (And
190 still I could not believe it!) I had been spelled to go for the orb.
191  
192 The Inn, (Tavern?) was still there, and so I phased in to the space that it
193 occupied. Things seemed oddly disjointed around me, for the first time
194 I realed that somthing was wrong. I had been so caught up with my own
195 problem that I had not noticed it before now. Things didnt feel right.
196 I walked to the building and entered cautuaslly. Inside were many
197 strange faces.
198  
199 "Hello" I said bowing in my fadded jeans and t-shirt, "I am the wonderer,
200 I sense somthing is wrong here. perhaps we can help each other?"

208    In Another Place;
209    I felt my body waver like a flag - being pure energy doesn't help when
210 you're buzzed on 80 proof ale... after a little concentration, I managed to
211 stop the wavering... Another person appeared.  "Hel - I am the Wonderer,
212 I sense something is wrong here.  Perhaps we can help each other?" the
213 new person asked.  Here I was, a mess.  (Hum.  Ah!   A pleasing image.)  I
214 reverted my form to that of my original body - a young man in an orange robe,
215 cross-legged and floating about a meter or so from the ground.  "Greetings,
216 Wonderer.  I am Hagbard Celine, Guru of Backwater and friend to friends.
217 The person in the robes is Friar, a good friend whom I was sharing a small
218 drink with (well, actually...) and the other, more forboding but friendly
219 berserker is Kurfur Redlig.  I'm sorry about the current circumstance, but
220 it seems something is amiss in Another Place, and it threatens the Realities
221 as we 'know' them.  I myself have been dissolved on my home Reality, which
222 nearly destroyed me."
223    "Shall we be seated at the bar?  Kurfur, look in your pack.  There should
224 be some smurfs who bear a striking resemblence to me inside.  I would like
225 Granola Smurfs, but I'm afraid that you are stuck with these - I created
226 their matter from part of my life force.  I don't want to try that again - 
227 it was too much.  Please enjoy them - Friar, would you like some Smurf
228 Bars?  Kinda like chocolate ice cream that never melts, so I'm told.
229  
230    -Barkeep!  A pitcher, on the remaining money you were given, and
231 two more steins for the visitors.  Kurfur & Wonderer, if you wish, there
232 are infinite drinks to be had, and of your own choice..." - this annoyed
233 the Barkeep even more, but he remembered the generosity of gold, shrugged
234 his shoulders at the strange appearences, and went for the drinks...I
235 considered the limitations of my powers.  So long as I tried not to create
236 matter, but to simply alter it, I would be fine.  The Smurf Bars had better
237 be worth it. (Gads!) I remembered.  It hurt so much because I created a
238 month's supply of smurf bars for 10 people.  If we started an
239 expedition, we would be stocked for 2 1/2 months with the good tasting
240 (and blocky-looking) Smurfs in chocolate.  Ugh!  Smurfs are OK, but we
241 do need other sources.  (Say, what will I eat?)

462    Another man appeared, and introduced himself.  Everyone was a little

464 the stranger introduced himself.  Then, much talk began about what to do

474 I can still re-shape some of Another Place to help us, but I can not
475 create objects.  To do so is to convert a part of me into that object,

477 so I will ask the Wonderer how he came to be here, unless the newer
478 arival would care to speak first?"

480    "Kurfur, how are the Smurf Bars?  And would you like some mead?"

482    "Friar, do you have any suggestions?  I think that something
483 is amiss - and I don't mean the destruction of the multiverses.  What
484 seems so out of place?  - or is it that I become that disoriented in

594  
595    Actually, Kurfur, I have been pondering the rest of the story (no
596 relation to Paul Harvey).  I've called this board 3 times today.
597  
598    Wonderer, it would seem that you should re-bind with the Item that you
599 seek, unless you wish not its responsibility.
600  
601    Talos, welcome to Another Place.  Feel free to order a drink.
602  
603    So, what should be done?  Is the item the cause, or is it that plus
604 a combination of other events that have all played havoc on the 
605 dimensions?  As to why my body was distroyed in its material form, I
606 still can not explain fully.  I think that my lapse in concentration and
607 the improper binding to the Item you seek created a nasty flux in the
608 cross-dimensions.  Any other ideas?  It still seems like there is just
609 one more thing-but I can't place my finger on it...
610  
611    Soon we shall have the objective for our quest, and we can start our
612 journey across the dimensions.  Um....uh oh.  I just realized something.
613 The problem can be in ANY dimension!  We'll have to move fast, and
614 cover alot of ground.  Even if we find the place, who knows how large it
615 is?

620  
621    Indeed!  I recalled the mysical scroll of recent knowledge.  The Man
622 in Black Robes is the missing element!  The improper binding, my lapse
623 in concentration, and some other force (probably from the Man in Black)
624 have combined to affect the multiverses!  I have sensed something of
625 what you have told me - this Man is not of the normal multiverse.  He
626 (or should I say IT?) is trying to accomplish something through the
627 destruction of the multiverses.  He is not responsible for his actions,
628 and the energies He gives off are erratic, suggesting that which mehums
629 call 'Evil'.  Indeed, this being is strong.  The Man must be contacted
630 and told of His responsibilities to all entities.  Otherwise, under 
631 the code of human ethics, He must be neutralized by relocation,
632 immobilization, or destruction (the least prefered).

675    " I seem to remember this man in black from my temporal wanderings.
676 He is very dangeruos to stand against, for he is not only Evil, but is

679 then I'm surprised he didn't destroy the Inn on arrival. He's planning
680 something, and our presence here is part of it. Perhaps he desires to 
681 get all resistance together and stationary, for either destruction or
682 containment. With little to stop him, he could totally crack a piece of
683 existance off, causing that part to become separate ond controllable.
684 What he doesn't realize, though, is that all of reality, and unreality,

701 troubles we have been experiencing. Perhaps if we find him we will
702 find the trouble. 
703  
704 But we must be aware that he could be nothing but a decoy to lure us
705 away from the true path we seek. 
706 Does anyone know were this lord of destruction lives? I think
707 I have a score to settle with him, As do the rest of us.

778         "Nothing."
779         Exhaustion workud its way into Grann's voice.  It had been
780 many hours since he had last rested.  The sudden change in his magickal
781 powers worried him- they seemed to increase every hour.  Complex
782 invocations of energy came easily to him, much too easily-
783         It came upon him suddenly, a gut-wrenching sensation that
784 almost felt like flesh tearing, filling his body with pain, a great
785 tidal wave of agony that swept over him and threatened to consume him.
786 Grann fell to the floor of xis workshop, screaming.  A few infinite
787 seconds later, the pain left as quickly as it had come, leaving Grann
788 shaken but alive.
789         "...w-what in Amigc's name w-was THAT?.." muttered the gnome
790 as his Silvi and his apprentice enteret the room at a run.  Quickly
791 they helped Grann to a chair and asked what had happened.
792         "I felt a force pulling at part of me, ripping it out and
793 taking it away- and another thing I know from somewhere but can't
794 remember, somethi~g fqmiliar yet strange, too."  Grann chuckled.  "I
795 sound just like an Arch-Mage, don't I?  Spewing paradoxes left and
796 right....'familiar yet strange'.  WHERE have I felt that sensation
797 before?"
798 +++++++++++++++
799         Milchar had walkud down the narrow road for some time
800 before he became discouraged and gave up in disgust.  This was no way
801 for an Arch-mage to travel, he thought.  He still remembered the
802 'cantations, and the Wand would provide the power.  He decided to
8 3 risk it.  Better that than waste more time on this road.
804         He began with the words, letting sharp syllables slice the air
805 as his hands begun their half-forgotten channelling movements:
806         "Yogok faleiph murgven kaleeh wrahpolik skeez.." Milchar began,
807 shaping the energies evoked by the Wand.  His hands enscribed a four
808 foot circle before him, the edges glowing brighter as he continued to
809 follow the precise formula.  Memory and attention to detail were the
81 0two0greatest assets to someone who practiced the Art, skills that Milchar
811 had long ago practiced and mastered.
812         Abruptly, the circle fell away, revealing a greener land within:
813 Celene.  Milchar's own home world.  Any search he might }ake0must begin
814 there, where he might draw upon old lore hidden within the labyrinth that
815 was his own home.  Joyfully, Milchar stepped forward-
816         -and fell as a tremendous tension broke, seeming to release a
817 great weight upon him>  A0few infinite seconds later, the pressure eased
818 as rapidly as it came.
819 +++++++++++++++
820         "It failed, Dimat."
821         "What?  That is impossible.  Check again."
822         "The level is still increasing.  More slowly, but increasing."
823         Damn that apprentice, thought Dimat.  That gnome is going to
824 cause untold trouble- perhaps even a class one disturbance in the plan.
825 It had to be Milchar, then.  The lie about Grann had been sufficient to
826 get him going+0he xad always been obedient.  If the Fates would keep
827 him from truth long enough to do the deed then things would go well
828 enough.
829         "Let us hope, then," said the mage, "that Milchar succeeds in
830 his mission before it is too late."

850 John Eddiso~ was enjoying a nice relaxing bath when the world split open.
851  
852 He wasn't accustomed to this sort of thing. Usually he was in his car 
853 driving to work, or talking on the phone when this sort of thing 
854 occured.
855  
856      He was yn fqct very fortunate this time, If he made it back there
857 would be no messy explanations to make. and luckily he had left his 
858 eeping robe draped over the curtain rail.
859      When the world returned to normal Mr. Eddison knew he was not 
860 at home. In fact he was probably someplace he had never been before.
861 he stood up, and put on his robe. Apsent mindedly he pulled the drain
862 switch and watched the water rush out and down. The bottom of his
863 robe was wet, but that really wasnd0im`rtant. It felt comfortable
864 , werever he was. "Hello, I'm coming out" he said pulling back the
865 curtain.
866  
867     There were many confused faces as he looked out into the dimly lit
868 room. There was a man behind a bar who didn't look0the0least bit happy.
869 Looking down on the floor Mr. Eddison began to realize why. All the
870 water had drained out of his tub an onto the floor. Why was it that
871 somthing like this always happened to him?
872  
873 He decided that if he ignorud it maybe nobody would bother him about
874 it. He steeped boldly out of the tub and onto the floor. And it
875 turned out flat on his face. Laughter rang out as those gathered 
876 within watched him stand. "I am John Eddison of the interdimensional
(77 `olice, I assure you that you are all in a lot of trouble!" he said
878 searching around for the orders that he knew must be thear. "That
879 is I think you are?" He added surching more franticly. 
880  
881 "Have any of you seen a small silver tubu?" xe asked finaly. Everyone
882 shook there heads.
883 "Where am I?" he asked finaly, feeling rather stupid.
